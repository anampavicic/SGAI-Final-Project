==Overview==
{{More citations needed|section|date=January 2023}}
Tourism is the major industry in Malindi. Notable heritage sites include the [[Vasco da Gama Pillar, Malindi|Vasco da Gama Pillar]], the [[Portuguese Chapel, Malindi|Portuguese Chapel]], the [[House of Columns, Malindi|House of Columns]] and the [[Malindi Museum Heritage Complex]].

Malindi is served with a domestic airport and a highway between [[Mombasa]] and [[Lamu]]. The nearby [[Watamu]] town and [[Ruins of Gedi|Gedi Ruins]] (also known as Gede) are south of Malindi. The mouth of the [[Athi-Galana-Sabaki River|Sabaki River]] lies in northern Malindi.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-06-28 |title=Top Affordable Places to Visit in Malindi Kenya |url=https://www.wakenyawataliitourstravel.com/top-affordable-places-to-visit-in-malindi-kenya/ |access-date=2023-05-15 |language=en-US}}</ref>

The [[Watamu Marine National Park|Watamu]] and [[Malindi Marine National Park]]s form a continuous protected coastal area south of Malindi. The area shows classic examples of [[Swahili architecture]]. The majority of Malindi's population is [[Islam in Kenya|Muslim]].<ref>[[Arye Oded|Oded, Arye]] (2000). ''Islam and Politics in Kenya''.

Malindi is home to the [[Malindi Airport]] and the [[Broglio Space Center]] (the previous ''San Marco Equatorial Range'').

== History ==
{{see also|Malindi Kingdom}}
[[File:Vasco da Gama e o Rei de Melinde (Centro Cultural Português de Santos).png|thumb|left|Portuguese explorer [[Vasco da Gama]] meeting the King of Malindi in 1498. The [[Portuguese Empire]] ruled Malindi from 1500 to 1630.]]
Malindi developed as part of the emerging [[Swahili people|Swahili]] civilisation in the 5th–10th centuries. [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking farmers moved into the area, where they [[smelted]] iron, built timber and wattle houses thatched with palm leaves, spoke a local dialect of [[kiSwahili]], and engaged in regional and sometimes long-distance trade. The resurgence of the [[Indian Ocean trade]] networks at the end of the first millennium led to larger settlements, increased long-distance trade, and greater social complexity. Beginning in the 11th century, the Swahili along the coast were acting as middlemen for [[Somalia|Somali]], [[Egypt|Egyptian]], [[Nubians|Nubian]], [[Saudi Arabia|Arab]], [[Persians|Persian]], and [[India|Indian]] traders. They began building walled towns, coral houses, and elites converted to Islam, often speaking Arabic.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Middleton |first1=John |title=The World of the Swahili |date=1994 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |pages=1–45}}</ref>

[[The Malindi Kingdom]] appears to have been formed around the 9th century AD and to have grown powerful in the two centuries before [[Vasco da Gama]] ushered in the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colonisation of the region, the latter leading to the decline of the civilisation. The city of Malindi, founded around 850 AD, was in a somewhat more northerly location than the modern city, and appears to have been destroyed around 1000 AD. There are sparse signs of habitation for the next two centuries, then recovery and prosperity in the 1200s.

The first written reference to the present-day Malindi likely comes from [[Ibn Kathir|Abu al-Fida]] (1273–1331), a [[Kurdish population|Kurdish]] geographer and historian. He wrote that Malindi was situated to the south of the mouth of a river which began in a mountain hundreds of miles away. This mountain may be [[Mount Kenya]], where the [[Athi-Galana-Sabaki River|Galana River]] rises. Thus, Malindi has existed as a [[Swahili people|Swahili]] settlement since at least the 13th century.<ref name=Martin1970>{{cite book|first=Esmond Bradley|last=Martin|title=Malindi. Past and Present|year=2009|publisher=The National Museum of Kenya|edition=New|orig-year=originally published in 1970}}</ref>

Once rivalled only by [[Mombasa]] for dominance in this part of East Africa, Malindi has traditionally been a port city. In 1414, the town was [[Ming treasure voyages#Fifth voyage|visited by the fleet]] of the Chinese explorer [[Zheng He]]. Malindi's ruler sent a personal envoy with a giraffe as a present to China on that fleet.<ref name=Martin1970/>

The Portuguese explorer [[Vasco da Gama]] met Malindi authorities in 1498 to sign a trade agreement and hire a guide for the voyage to India, when he erected a [[padrão]] known today as the [[Vasco da Gama Pillar, Malindi|Vasco da Gama Pillar]]. Vasco da Gama was given a warm reception from the Sultan of Malindi, which contrasted with the hostile reception he encountered in [[Mombasa]].<ref name=Martin1970/> It is a popular tourist attraction for both local and international tourists.

In 1498 Malindi was a prosperous town with a population between 5,000 and 10,000. The majority of the population was Muslim by this period, having converted largely between the 13th and 14th centuries. Like other Mediaeval Swahili towns, the ruling class or ''wazee'' was made up of the heads of the wealthiest patrician families. Similar to other Bantu-speaking peoples, these clan leaders elected a ''mwenye mui'' or chief who spoke on behalf of the patricians. The Portuguese mistakenly titled these individuals "Kings," misunderstanding the nature of Swahili political organisation. The ''wazee'' spoke both Swahili and Arabic, and claimed mythological origins from the East, most often Persia.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Vernet |first1=Thomas |title=Les Cites-Etats Swahili de L'Archipel de Lamu, 1585–1810 |date=2005 |publisher=Universite Paris I |location=Paris |pages=103–104}}</ref>

Malindi's main source of prosperity was the export of ivory and rhino horns as well as exporting agricultural products such as coconuts, oranges, millet and rice.<ref name=Martin1970/> In the years before the arrival of the Portuguese, Malindi was a regional power but lagged significantly behind the two greatest states, Mombasa and Kilwa. When, in 1499, the Portuguese established a trading post in Malindi that served as a rest stop on the way to and from India, they were eagerly welcomed by the ''wazee'' who sought to use the Portuguese military might to establish themselves over their rivals in Mombasa. In 1500, King Dom [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] offered vassal status to Malindi. Malindi supported Portugal's successful efforts to conquer Kilwa and Mombasa in 1505. In 1502, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] established a [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in Malindi, which lasted till 1593.<ref>[https://museums.or.ke/the-portuguese-chapel/ 'The Portuguese Chapel', National Museums of Kenya website.]</ref> The decline of Kilwa and Mombasa led to Malindi's flourishing. Malindi grew as other Swahili, as well as Arab, Persian, and Indian, merchants, craftsmen, sailors, and labourers flocked to newly powerful city.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Vernet |first1=Thomas |title=Les Cites-Etats Swahili de L'Archipel de Lamu, 1585–1810 |date=2005 |publisher=Universite Paris I |location=Paris |pages=65–97}}</ref>

Malindi remained the centre of Portuguese activity in eastern Africa until 1593, when the Portuguese moved their main base to Mombasa.<ref>Eric Axelson, ''Portuguese in South-East Africa 1488-1600'' (C. Struik Ltd. 1973), p. 188-197.</ref> This was through the help of the Segejus and the Sheikh of Malindi. As the major East African ally of Portugal along the Swahili Coast, Malindi supported Portugal's successful efforts to conquer Kilwa and Mombasa. The two Swahili city states often had feuds with each other as they fought for dominance over the trade. In his military struggles against Mombasa, the Sheikh of Malindi allied with the Portuguese and Segeju to take over the city.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Pouwels |first1=Randall L. |last2=Ogot |first2=B.

[[File:Admiralty Chart No 667 Port Melinda (Malindi) detail.jpg|thumb|left|Admiralty Chart No 667 Port Melinda (Malindi) detail]]
After the Portuguese departed the town gradually declined until it almost disappeared by the end of 17th century. An 1823 [[Admiralty (United Kingdom)|United Kingdom Admiralty]] chart of 'Melinda' declared that at that time there were 'no vestiges of the once splendid city of Melinda' apart from [[Vasco da Gama Pillar, Malindi|Vasco da Gama's Pillar]].<ref>[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Admiralty_Chart_No_667_Port_Melinda_(Malindi)_detail.jpg 'Admiralty Chart No 667 Port Melinda (Malindi) detail']</ref> In 1845, [[Johann Ludwig Krapf|Ludwig Krapf]] visited the town and found it overgrown by vegetation and uninhabited.<ref name=Martin1970/> A [[Portuguese Chapel, Malindi|Portuguese chapel]] with a graveyard was built before 1542 when [[Francis Xavier]] visited the town.<ref name=Martin1970/> Many buildings of [[Swahili architecture]] survive, including the Juma Mosque.

[[File:Melinda in Melinda chart 1873.jpg|thumb|Plan of Malindi, April 1873]]
Malindi was refounded by [[Majid bin Said of Zanzibar|Sultan Majid]] of [[Zanzibar]] in 1861 and until the end of 19th century served as a centre of the slave trade. A plan of the town in 1873 indicates the area of occupation by that time.<ref>[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Melinda_chart_1873.jpg Plan of Melinda (Malindi, Kenya), 29 April 1873]</ref> In 1890, Malindi came under British administration and slave trade and slavery were abolished. This act led to a significant decline in agricultural production. Outside agriculture there were few industries in Malindi at the beginning of the 20th century; among them were making mats and bags, crushing [[sesame]] seeds for oil and producing a Swahili drink called tembo. Malindi was officially made a town in 1903. Ten years later its population stood at around 1148 and included 843 Africans, 230 Arabs, 67 Asians and 8 Europeans.<ref name=Martin1970/><ref>{{Cite journal |last=de V.

[[Image:Malindi town view.jpg|thumb|200px|A view of the old town of Malindi]]
Malindi experienced a trade boom between the end of the World War I and 1925, when a famine occurred. Exports to foreign ports grew to £26,000 by 1924. Europeans started to return to Malindi in the 1930s, buying land from Arabs. Some of them like [[Sydney Turing Barlow Lawford|Commander Lawford]] opened the first hotels, which became the foundation of the future tourist industry. During [[World War II]], Malindi was one of only two towns in East Africa bombed by the Italians. This happened on 24 October 1940, and after this event allied troops were stationed in the town until the end of the war. After World War II Malindi began developing into a resort.<ref name=Martin1970/>
