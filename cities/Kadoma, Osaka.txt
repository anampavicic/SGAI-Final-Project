==History==
The area of the modern city of Kadoma was within ancient [[Kawachi Province]].  During the [[Jōmon period]], this area was under [[Kawachi Bay]],and inlet of [[Osaka Bay]]. During the [[Yayoi period]] the bay became a lake and various settlements arose on its shores. ''[[Dotaku]]'' ritual objects and ''[[kofun]]'' [[burial mound]]s were built, and the ''[[Kojiki]]'' and ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' record that [[Emperor Nintoku]] ordered the construction of an embankment to control repeated flooding of the [[Yodo River]], the early known of such projects in Japan. During the [[Heian period]], large ''[[shōen]]'' landed estates were established, and in the [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]] and [[Muromachi period]], the entire area of the city was under cultivation. During the [[Edo Period]], due to its proximity to [[Kyoto]] and Osaka, most of the area was held as ''[[tenryō]]'' territory under the direct control of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. The village of Kadoma, was established within Matta District with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889.  On April 1, 1896 the area became part of [[Kitakawachi District, Osaka]]. On April 1, 1939 Kadoma raised to town status. The neighboring villages of Owada and Shinomiya were absorbed on September 30, 1956. On August 1, 1963 Kadoma was raised to city status. Plans to merge Kadoma with the neighboring city of [[Moriguchi, Osaka|Moriguchi]] were rejected overwhelming by local residents of both cities in 2005.

==Government==
Kadoma has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 20 members. Kadoma contributes one member to the [[Osaka Prefectural Assembly]]. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Osaka 6th district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].
