'''Stavropol''' ({{langx|ru|Ставрополь}}, {{IPA|ru|ˈstavrəpəlʲ|IPA}}), known as '''Voroshilovsk''' from 1935 until 1943,<ref>Ageeva, R. A., Pospelov, E. M. (1998). Географические названия мира: топонимический словарь : свыше 5,000 единиц. Russia: Russkie slovari.</ref> is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] and the [[administrative centre]] of [[Stavropol Krai]], in southern [[Russia]]. As of the [[Russian Census (2021)|2021 Census]], its population was 547,820, making it one of Russia's fastest growing cities.<ref name=2021Census>{{cite web|title=Оценка численности постоянного населения по субъектам Российской Федерации|url=https://rosstat.gov.ru/storage/mediabank/tab-5_VPN-2020.xlsx|publisher=[[Federal State Statistics Service (Russia)|Federal State Statistics Service]]|accessdate=1 September 2022}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Stavropol'' ({{lang-rus|Ста́врополь}}) is a Russian rendering of the Greek name, {{lang|grc|[[Stauroupolis (disambiguation)|Stauropolis]]}} ({{lang-grc-gre|Σταυρούπολις}} 'City of the Cross'). According to legend, soldiers found a stone cross there while building the fortress in the city's future location.<ref name="stavmed"/> It is unrelated to Byzantine [[Aphrodisias|Stauroupolis]] (ancient Aphrodisias) in [[Asia Minor]], nor to the city of [[Tolyatti|Stavropol-on-Volga]] (now called Tolyatti).

==History==
It was founded on October&nbsp;22, 1777<ref name="Established">Charter of Stavropol, Article&nbsp;2</ref> following the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)|Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774]] as a military encampment,<ref name=stavmed>{{cite web|title=Stavropol|url=http://stavmed.com/page_88.html|publisher=stavmed.com|access-date=October 12, 2015}}</ref> and was granted city status in 1785.<ref name="gr">{{cite book|title=Энциклопедия Города России|year=2003|publisher=Большая Российская Энциклопедия|location=Moscow|isbn=5-7107-7399-9|pages=438}}</ref> Prince [[Grigory Potemkin]], who founded Stavropol as one of ten fortresses built between [[Azov]] and [[Mozdok, Republic of North Ossetia–Alania|Mozdok]] at the request of [[Catherine the Great]], played a leading role in the creation of the city. [[Don Cossacks]], particularly those from the [[Khopersky]] Regiment, settled the area in and around the cities of Stavropol and [[Georgiyevsk]] with a mission to defend borders of the Empire.<ref>[http://www.stavropol-gorod.ru/about/clause/396/407625/]{{Dead link|date=May 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=no}}</ref>

[[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;I]] in 1809 invited several [[Armenia]]n families to settle by the fortress, in order to encourage trade in the region.

Stavropol's strategic location aided the [[Russian Empire]]'s conquest of the [[Caucasus]]. By the early 19th century the city grew into a busy trade center of the [[North Caucasus]]. In 1843, an [[Episcopal see]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] was established in Stavropol and in 1847 the city became the seat of [[Stavropol Governorate]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.stavkray.ru/o_stavropolskom_krae/history/ |title=История Ставропольского края |access-date=2008-01-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070217191750/http://www.portal.stavkray.ru/o_stavropolskom_krae/history/ |archive-date=February 17, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

During the [[Russian Civil War]] the city changed hands several times and finally was captured by the [[Red Army]] from the [[Volunteer Army]] of general [[Anton Denikin]] on February&nbsp;29, 1920. The city was renamed ''Voroshilovsk'' on May&nbsp;5, 1935, after [[Kliment Voroshilov]], but the original name was restored by decree on January 12, 1943.<ref name="Rename">Decree  of January&nbsp;12, 1943</ref> The [[Great Patriotic War]] took a heavy toll on the city and between August&nbsp;3, 1942 and January&nbsp;21, 1943 Stavropol was occupied by the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] and its airport was used as a base for the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (German air force) to bomb Soviet oil supplies in [[Grozny]]. The city was liberated by the Soviet Army in January 1943. Since 1946, [[natural gas]] has been extracted near the city; later on, a pipeline to supply [[Moscow]] was built.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Stavropol is the [[administrative center]] of the [[krai]].<ref name="Ref371">Law #9-kz</ref> Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is, together with one [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|rural locality]] (the ''[[khutor]]'' of [[Grushevy, Stavropol Krai|Grushevy]]), incorporated as the '''[[city of federal subject significance|city of krai significance]] of Stavropol'''—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Stavropol Krai|districts]].<ref name="Ref372">Resolution #63-p</ref> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the city of krai significance of Stavropol is incorporated as '''Stavropol Urban Okrug'''.<ref name="Ref893">Law #88-kz</ref>

==Economy==
Stavropol's economy focuses on the production of automobiles, furniture, and construction equipment and materials. The city relies on air transport through [[Stavropol Shpakovskoye Airport|Shpakovskoye airport]] as well as rail and highway connections to other Russian cities.

==Demographics==

Stavropol's 2021 population is now estimated at 453,387. In 1950, the population of Stavropol was 108,353. Stavropol has grown by 3,293 since 2015, which represents a 0.73% annual change.{{Historical populations|1897|41590|1926|57405|1939|85251|1959|141023|1970|198251|1979|258233|1989|318298|2002|354867|2010|398539|2021|547443|type=|footnote=Source: Census data}}

==Facilities==
Stavropol has a theater and an [[association football]] team called [[FC Dynamo Stavropol]].

The main educational institutions of the town include [[North-Caucasus Federal University]], [[Stavropol State Agrarian University]], and Stavropol State Medical University.

The area of Russia in which Stavropol resides is very mountainous, placing the city in the midst of the northern [[Caucasus]] mountain range. The city has one of the biggest city parks in Russia, 'Victory Park' covering up to 200 hectares.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

The city, like many other Russian cities has its own [[botanical garden]], which covers up to 18 hectares, including 16 hectares of natural woods.<ref name=stavmed/><ref>{{cite web|title=Biorepository: Stavropol Botanical Garden|url=http://biocol.org/institution/stavropol-botanical-garden|publisher=biocol.org|access-date=October 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304190834/http://biocol.org/institution/stavropol-botanical-garden|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Climate==
Stavropol experiences a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa''), using the 0°C (32°F) isotherm, with short but cold winters (though mild for Russia) and hot summers. [[Precipitation]] is rather low, with a {{convert|562|mm|sp=us}} annual average.

Stavropol is not protected by the mountains in the winter months, so it can frequently get very cold. The lowest temperature recorded in Stavropol was {{convert|-28.3|C|F}} on [[Early 2012 European cold wave|8 February 2012]], while the highest was {{convert|+39.7|C|F}} on [[2006 European heat wave#In Russia|8 August 2006]].
