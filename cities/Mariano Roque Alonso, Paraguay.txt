'''Mariano Roque Alonso''' ({{IPA|es|maˈɾja.no ˈro.ke aˈlon.so}}) is a district and city located in the [[Central Department]], in [[Paraguay]] in the [[Gran Asunción]] metropolitan area. The city has a population of 85,000 people.

The city was founded in 1944 and is located between the [[Paraguay River]] and the Transchaco Road, some 18&nbsp;kilometers away from the city of [[Asunción]]. This optimal location has allowed the city quick commercial, industrial, and social development.

The town is known because on the afternoon of [[February 4]], [[1996]], [[LAC Colombia Flight 028]] crashed while taking off from [[Silvio Pettirossi International Airport]], killing the 4 crew and 18 people on the ground. With 22 people dead, it is the worst air accident in the history of Paraguay.

Mariano Roque Alonso is home to the site of the biggest annual [[Trade fair|Expo]] show in Paraguay where companies and industries showcase their latest products.
