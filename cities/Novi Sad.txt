'''Novi Sad''' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Нови Сад}}, {{IPA|sh|nôʋiː sâːd|pron|NoviSad.ogg}}; [[#Name|see below]] for other names) is the [[List of cities in Serbia|second largest city]] in [[Serbia]] after the capital [[Belgrade]] and the capital of the autonomous province of [[Vojvodina]]. It is located in the southern portion of the [[Pannonian Plain]] on the border of the [[Bačka]] and [[Syrmia]] geographical regions. Lying on the banks of the [[Danube]] river, the city faces the northern slopes of [[Fruška Gora]] and it is the fifth largest of all [[List of cities and towns on the Danube river|cities on the Danube river]]. It is the largest Danube city that is not the capital of an independent state.

{{As of|2022|alt=According to the 2022 census}}, the population of the administrative area of the city totals 368,967,<ref>{{Serbian census 2022|p=44}}</ref> while its urban area (including the adjacent settlements of [[Petrovaradin]] and [[Sremska Kamenica]]) comprises 306,702 inhabitants. According to the city's Informatika Agency, Novi Sad had 414,386 inhabitants (metro) in 2024.{{Citation needed|date=October 2024}}

Novi Sad was founded in 1694, when [[Serb]] merchants formed a colony across the Danube from the [[Petrovaradin Fortress]], a strategic [[Habsburg]] military post. In subsequent centuries, it became an important trading, manufacturing and cultural centre, and has historically been dubbed ''the Serbian Athens''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pbi_wzu7QAMC&pg=PA278 |title=We, the people: politics of national peculiarity in Southeastern Europe |last=Mishkova |first=Diana |pages=277–278|isbn=9789639776289 |date=1 January 2009 |publisher=Central European University Press }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.novisad.rs/en/content/history-of-novi-sad |title=History of Novi Sad |publisher=Official Website of Novi Sad |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719035628/http://novisad.rs/en/content/history-of-novi-sad |archive-date=19 July 2011 }}</ref> The city was heavily devastated in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|1848 Revolution]], but was subsequently rebuilt and restored.

In both [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]], which are official in provincial administration, the city is called ''Novi Sad''. Historically, the city was called ''Neusatz'' and ''Neusatz an der Donau'' (translated as 'Novi Sad on the Danube') in [[German language|German]].

In its [[sensu lato|wider]] meaning, the name ''Grad Novi Sad'' refers to the "City of Novi Sad", one of the city-level [[Subdivisions of Serbia|administrative units]] of [[Serbia]], which includes Novi Sad proper on the left bank of the Danube, the towns of Sremska Kamenica and Petrovaradin on the right bank and the extensive suburbs of the left bank. ''Novi Sad'' can also refer [[sensu stricto|strictly]] to only the urban areas of the city (Novi Sad proper and the towns of Sremska Kamenica and Petrovaradin), or only to the historical core on the left bank, i.e. Novi Sad proper excluding Sremska Kamenica and Petrovaradin.

Human habitation in the territory of present-day Novi Sad has been traced as far back as the [[Stone Age]]. Several settlements and [[necropolis]]es dating to 5000 BC were unearthed during the construction of a new boulevard in [[Avijaticarsko Naselje|Avijatičarsko Naselje]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtv.rs/sr_lat/vojvodina/novi-sad/arheolosko-nalaziste-na-cetvrtoj-trasi-bulevara-evrope_322804.html|title=Arheološko nalazište na četvrtoj trasi Bulevara Evrope|author=Javna medijska ustanova Radio-televizija Vojvodine|work=Radio-televizija Vojvodine|access-date=18 March 2015|language=sr}}</ref> A settlement was also identified on the right bank of the river [[Danube]] in present-day [[Petrovaradin]].

In antiquity, the region was inhabited by [[Celtic tribes]], most notably the [[Scordisci]]. Celts had been present in the area since the 4th century BC and founded the first fortress on the right bank of the Danube. Later, in the 1st century BC, the region was conquered by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. During Roman rule, a larger fortress was built in the 1st century, named ''Cusum'', and included in the [[Roman province]] of [[Pannonia]].

In the 5th century, Cusum was devastated by [[Huns|Hunnic invasions]]. By the end of the century, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] had rebuilt the town and called it ''Petrikon'' or ''Petrikov'' ({{langx|el|Πέτρικον}}) after [[Saint Peter]]. [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes such as the [[Severians]], the [[Obotrites]] and the [[Serbs]] (including the subtribes of the [[Braničevci]] and the [[Timočani]]) settled the region around Novi Sad, mainly in the 6th and 7th centuries.<ref name="Sava S 1998, page 36">Sava S. Vujić – Bogdan M. Basarić, ''Severni Srbi (ne)zaboravljeni narod,'' Beograd, 1998, pg. 36<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2013}} The Serbs absorbed the aforementioned Slavic groups as well as the [[Prehistory of Southeastern Europe|Paleo-Balkanic]] peoples of the region.<ref name="Sava S 1998, page 36" />

In the Middle Ages, the area was controlled by the [[Ostrogoths]], [[Gepids]], [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], [[Franks]], [[West Slavs|West Slavic groups]], again by the Byzantines, and finally by the [[Hungarians]]. It was a part of the medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary]] from its foundation in 1000 until the Ottoman invasion in the 16th century. Hungarians began to settle in the area, which before that time had been mostly populated by Slavs. The earliest known mention was as the Hungarian variant ''Peturwarad'' or ''Pétervárad'' (Serbian: ''Petrovaradin''/Петроварадин), derived from the Byzantine variant, found in documents from 1237. That year, several other settlements were mentioned as existing in the territory of modern-day urban Novi Sad.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

From the 13th century to the 16th century, the following settlements existed in the urban territory of the modern-day Novi Sad:<ref name=Curcin>Branko Ćurčin, [[Slana Bara]] nekad i sad, Novi Sad, 2002.</ref><ref name="Borovszky">Borovszky Samu: Magyarország vármegyéi és városai, Bács-Bodrog vármegye I.-II. kötet, Apolló Irodalmi és Nyomdai Részvénytársaság, 1909.</ref>
*on the right bank of the Danube: ''Pétervárad'' ({{langx|sr|Petrovaradin}}) and ''Kamanc'' ({{langx|sr|Kamenica}}).
*on the left bank of the Danube: ''Baksa'' or ''Baksafalva'' ({{langx|sr|Bakša, Bakšić}}), ''Kűszentmárton'' ({{langx|sr|Sent Marton}}), ''Bivalyos'' or ''Bivalo'' ({{langx|sr|Bivaljoš, Bivalo}}), ''Vásárosvárad'' or ''Várad'' ({{langx|sr|Vašaroš Varad, Varadinci}}), ''Zajol I'' ({{langx|sr|[[Gornje Livade, Novi Sad|Sajlovo I]], Gornje Sajlovo, Gornje Isailovo}}), ''Zajol II'' ({{langx|sr|[[Sajlovo]] II, Donje Sajlovo, Donje Isailovo}}), ''Bistritz'' ({{langx|sr|[[Bistrica (Novo Naselje)|Bistrica]]}}). Some other settlements existed in the suburbs of Novi Sad: ''Mortályos'' (Serbian: ''Mrtvaljoš''), ''Csenei'' ({{langx|sr|[[Čenej]]}}), ''Keménd'' ({{langx|sr|[[Kamendin, Sirig|Kamendin]]}}), ''Rév'' ({{langx|sr|Rivica}}).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

An etymology of settlement names reveals that some designations are of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] origin, which indicates that the areas were initially inhabited by Slavs, particularly the [[West Slavs]]. For example, Bivalo (Bivaljoš) had a large Slavic settlement dating from the 5th–6th centuries.<ref name="Curcin" /> Other names are of [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] origin (for example Bélakút, Kűszentmárton, Vásárosvárad, Rév), indicating that the settlements were inhabited by Hungarians before the [[Ottoman invasion]] in the 16th century.<ref name="Borovszky" /> Some settlement names are of uncertain origin.

Tax records from 1522 show a mix of Hungarian and Slavic names among the inhabitants of these villages, including Slavic names like Bozso (Božo), Radovan, Radonya (Radonja), Ivo, etc. Following the Ottoman invasion in the 16th–17th centuries, some of these settlements were destroyed. Most of the surviving Hungarian inhabitants retreated from the area. Some of the settlements persisted under Ottoman rule and were populated by ethnic Serbs.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Between 1526 and 1687, the region was under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. In 1590, the population of all villages in the territory of present-day Novi Sad numbered 105 houses, inhabited exclusively by Serbs. Ottoman records mention only those who paid taxes, so the number of Serbs who lived in the area (for example, those that served in the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]]) was likely larger than was recorded.<ref>{{cite book|author=Đorđe Randelj|title=Novi Sad slobodan grad|location=Novi Sad|year=1997|language=sr}}</ref>

=== Founding of Novi Sad ===
[[File:Kaiserin Maria Theresia (HRR).jpg|thumb|[[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] prohibited Orthodox Christians to settle in [[Petrovaradin]]. That policy pushed Serbs to form the ''Serb city'' which later became Novi Sad. The city was proclaimed to be a free royal city by [[Maria Theresa]] by 1748.]]

Habsburg rule was aligned with the Roman Catholic doctrine and, as it took over this area near the end of the 17th century, the government prohibited people of [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox faith]] from residing in [[Petrovaradin]]. Unable to build homes there, the Serbs of the area founded a new settlement in 1694 on the left bank of the Danube. They initially called it the 'Serb city' ({{langx|sr|Srpski Grad}}, {{langx|de|[[Rascians|Ratzen]] Stadt}}). Another name used for the settlement was Petrovaradinski Šanac. In 1718, the inhabitants of the village of [[Almaš]] were resettled to Petrovaradinski Šanac, where they founded [[Almaški Kraj]] ('the Almaš quarter').

According to 1720 data, the population of Ratzen Stadt was composed of 112 Serbian, 14 German, and 5 Hungarian houses. The settlement officially gained the present names ''Novi Sad'' and ''Újvidék'' (''Neoplanta'' in Latin) in 1748 when it became a 'free royal city', in German language it was called Neusatz.

The edict that made Novi Sad a 'free royal city' was proclaimed on 1 February 1748. The edict reads:
{{blockquote|' We, [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], by the grace of God [[Holy Roman Empress]],<br />Queen of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Croatia]], [[Slavonia]], [[Prozor-Rama|Rama]], [[Serbia]], [[Galicia (Central-Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], [[Lodomeria]], [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], [...]<br />cast this proclamation to anyone, whom it might concern... so that the renowned Petrovaradinski Šanac, which lies on the other side of the Danube in the [[Bačka]] province on the [[Sajlovo]] land, by the might of our divine royal power and prestige...make this town a [[Free imperial city|Free Royal City]] and to fortify, accept and acknowledge it as one of the free royal cities of our [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and other territories, by abolishing its previous name of Petrovaradinski Šanac, renaming it Neoplanta ([[Latin]]), Új-Vidégh ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]), Neusatz (German) and Novi Sad ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]) '|sign=|source=}}

In the 18th century, the Habsburg monarchy recruited Germans from the southern principalities of the Holy Roman Empire to relocate to the Danube valley. They wanted both to increase the population and to redevelop the river valley for agriculture, which had declined markedly under the Ottomans. To encourage such settlement, the government ensured that the German communities could practice their religion (mostly Catholicism) and use their original German dialect.

For much of the 18th and 19th centuries, Novi Sad remained the largest city inhabited by Serbs. The reformer of the Serbian language, [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]], wrote in 1817 that Novi Sad was the 'largest Serb municipality in the world'. It was a cultural and political centre for Serbs (see also [[Serbian Revival]]), who did not have their own [[Nation state|national state]] at the time. Due to its cultural and political influence, the city became known as the 'Serbian [[Athens]]' (''Srpska Atina'' in Serbian). According to 1843 data, Novi Sad had 17,332 inhabitants, of whom 9,675 were [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], 5,724 [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], 1,032 [[Protestants]], 727 Jews, and 30 adherents of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian church]]. The largest [[ethnic group]] in the city were Serbs, and the second largest were [[Germans]].

During the [[Revolutions of 1848|Revolution of 1848–49]], Novi Sad was part of [[Serbian Vojvodina]], a Serbian [[Autonomous area|autonomous region]] within the Austrian Empire. In 1849, the Hungarian garrison, located at the Petrovaradin Fortress, bombarded and devastated the city, which lost much of its population. According to the 1850 census, there were only 7,182 citizens left in the city, compared to 17,332 in 1843. [[Marija Trandafil]] and her husband paid for some of the rebuilding including two churches.<ref name=nreview>{{cite web|title=Национална Ревија - National Review|url=https://www.nacionalnarevija.com/en/tekstovi/Br%2022/07%20Dobrotvori%20-%20Marija%20Trandafil.html|access-date=2021-07-18|website=www.nacionalnarevija.com}}</ref> Between 1849 and 1860, Novi Sad was part of a separate Austrian crownland known as the [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]]. After the abolishment of this province, the city was included into the [[Bács-Bodrog County|Batsch-Bodrog]] County. The post office was opened in 1853.

Following the [[compromise of 1867]], Novi Sad was located within the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the ''[[Transleithania]]'', which comprised half of the new [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. During this time, the [[Magyarization]] policy of the Hungarian government drastically altered the demographic structure of the city as the formerly predominantly Serbian population became one with a more mixed character. In 1880, 41.2% of the city's inhabitants used the [[Serbian language]] most frequently and 25.9% employed Hungarian. In the following decades, the percentage of Serbian-speakers decreased, while the number of Hungarian-speakers increased. According to the 1910 census, the city had 33,590 residents, of whom 13,343 (39.72%) spoke Hungarian, 11,594 (34.52%) Serbian, 5,918 (17.62%) German and 1,453 (4.33%) Slovak. It is not certain whether Hungarians or Serbs were the larger ethnic group in the city in 1910, since the various ethnic groups ([[Bunjevci]], [[Romani people|Romani]], Jews, other [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] people, etc.) were classified in census results only according to the language they spoke.<ref>Triva Militar, Novi Sad na raskrsnici minulog i sadanjeg veka, Novi Sad, 2000, p. 320</ref>

Similar demographic changes can be seen in the religious structure: in 1870, the population of Novi Sad included 8,134 Orthodox Christians, 6,684 Catholics, 1,725 Calvinists, 1,343 Lutherans, and others.<ref>Triva Militar, Novi Sad na raskrsnici minulog i sadanjeg veka, Novi Sad, 2000, p. 317</ref> In 1910, the population included 13,383 [[Roman Catholics]] and 11,553 Orthodox Christians, while 3,089 declared themselves as [[Lutheran]], 2,751 as [[Calvinist]], and 2,326 as Jewish.<ref>[http://mek.niif.hu/06700/06758/pdf/revai18_3.pdf Újvidék].

On 25 November 1918, the [[Great People's Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci and other Slavs in Banat, Bačka and Baranja|Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci and other Slavs]] of Vojvodina in Novi Sad proclaimed the union of the region of Vojvodina with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. From 1 December 1918, Novi Sad was part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]]; and in 1929, it became the capital of the [[Danube Banovina]], a province of the newly named Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In 1921, the population of Novi Sad numbered 39,122 inhabitants, 16,293 of whom spoke the Serbian language, 12,991 Hungarian, 6,373 German, 1,117 Slovak, etc.<ref>Agneš Ozer, Život i istorija u Novom Sadu, Novi Sad, 2005, p. 15</ref>

In 1941, Yugoslavia was invaded and partitioned by the [[Axis powers]], and its northern parts, including Novi Sad, were annexed by [[Hungary during World War II|Hungary]]. During [[World War II]], about 5,000 citizens were murdered and many others were resettled. During the three days of the [[1942 raid in Novi Sad|Novi Sad raid]] (21–23 January 1942) alone, Hungarian police killed 1,246 citizens, among them more than 800 Jews, and threw their corpses into the icy waters of the Danube.

The total death toll of the raid was around 2,500.<ref name=Cesarani>{{cite book|title=Genocide and Rescue: The Holocaust in Hungary 1944|author=David Cesarani|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrK8B0VpFBkC&pg=PR7|page=13|publisher=Berg Publishers|isbn=978-1-85973-126-0|year=1997|access-date=4 August 2009}}</ref><ref name=Sajti>{{cite journal|title=The Former 'Southlands' in Serbia: 1918–1947|author=[[Enikő A.

The [[Yugoslav Partisans]] of [[Syrmia]] and [[Bačka]] entered the city on 23 October 1944. During the military administration of [[Banat, Bačka and Baranja]] (17 October 1944 – 27 January 1945), the Partisans [[1944–1945 killings in Vojvodina|killed tens of thousands]], mostly Serbs, Germans, and Hungarians, who were perceived as opponents to the new regime.<ref>Večernje Novosti, Utorak, 9.

Novi Sad became part of the new [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Since 1945, Novi Sad has been the capital of [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina|Vojvodina]], a province of the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Republic of Serbia]]. The city went through rapid industrialization and its population more than doubled in the period between World War II and the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s.

After 1992, Novi Sad became a part of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Devastated by [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO bombardment]] during the [[Kosovo War]] of 1999, [[1999 NATO bombing of Novi Sad|Novi Sad was left]] without any of its three Danube bridges ([[Žeželj Bridge]], [[Varadin Bridge]] and [[Liberty Bridge, Novi Sad|Liberty Bridge]]), communications, water, and electricity. Residential areas were cluster-bombed several times while the [[oil refinery]] was bombarded daily, causing severe pollution and widespread ecological damage. In 2003, FR Yugoslavia was transformed into the [[Political union|state union]] of [[Serbia and Montenegro]]. These two states separated in June 2006 (following the May 2006 [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|Montenegrin independence referendum]]), leaving Novi Sad part of the [[Republic of Serbia]].

== Geography ==
[[File:Trg Slobode nocu.jpg|thumb|Novi Sad panoramic view, 2022.]]
The city lies on the [[meander]] of the river Danube, which is only 350 meters wide beneath the marking stones of Petrovaradin.<ref name="GeoNS" /> A section of the [[Danube-Tisa-Danube Canal|Danube-Tisza-Danube Canal]] marks the northern edge of the wider city centre. The main part of the city lies on the left bank of the Danube in the region of [[Bačka]], while the smaller settlements of [[Petrovaradin]] and [[Sremska Kamenica]] lie on the right bank, in the region of [[Srem]] (Syrmia). The section situated on the left bank of the river lies on one of the southernmost and lowest parts of the [[Pannonian Plain]], while [[Fruška Gora]] on the right bank is a [[Horst (geology)|horst]] mountain. [[Alluvial plain]]s along the Danube are well-formed, especially on the left bank, and in some parts {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} from the river. A large part of Novi Sad lies on a [[fluvial terrace]] with an elevation of between {{convert|80|and|83|m|0|abbr=off}}. The northern part of Fruška Gora is composed of massive [[landslide]] zones, although they are largely inactive with the exception of the [[Ribnjak, Novi Sad|Ribnjak]] neighbourhood between [[Sremska Kamenica]] and [[Petrovaradin Fortress]].<ref name="UrbNS">Завод за урбанизам: "Еколошки Атлас Новог Сада" ("Ecological Atlas of Novi Sad"), page 14-15, 1994.</ref>

The east-southeasterly wind, known as [[Košava (wind)|Košava]], blows from the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] and brings clear and dry weather. It mostly blows in autumn and winter, in 2 to 3-day intervals. The [[Velocity|average speed]] of Košava is {{convert|25|to|43|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, but gusts can sometimes reach up to {{convert|130|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. In wintertime, accompanied by [[Winter storm|snow storms]], the winds can cause large snow-drifts.

[[File:Kule na Limanu.JPG|thumb|upright=1.0|left|Liman Towers, tallest buildings in Novi Sad since 1990.]]

Novi Sad is a typical Central European town in terms of its architecture. The Town Hall and the Court House were built by Emmerich Kitzweger (1868–1917). The city was almost completely destroyed during the [[revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|1848/1849 revolution]], so architecture from the 19th century dominates the [[Stari Grad, Novi Sad|city centre]]. Small, older houses used to surround the centre of town, but they are now being replaced by modern, multi-story buildings.

During the socialist period, new city blocks with wide streets and multi-story buildings were constructed around the city core. However, not many [[plattenbau|communist-style]] high-rise buildings were erected. The total number of [[apartment building]]s, with ten or more floors, remained at about 50, the rest having mostly three to six floors. From 1962 to 1964, a new [[boulevard]], today called ''Bulevar oslobođenja'', was cut through the older neighbourhoods, establishing major communication lines. Several more boulevards were subsequently built in a similar manner, creating an [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] network which replaced the primarily radial structure of the old town. These interventions paved the way for a relatively unhampered growth of the city, which has almost tripled in population since the 1950s. Despite a huge increase in car ownership, [[traffic congestion]] is still relatively mild, apart from a few major arteries.

=== Neighbourhoods ===
{{Main|Neighborhoods of Novi Sad}}
[[File:20230429.Ansichten in Novi Sad.-015.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|right|Dunavska street in [[Stari Grad, Novi Sad|Stari Grad]], 2023.]]

Some of the oldest neighbourhoods in the city are [[Stari Grad, Novi Sad|Stari Grad]] (Old Town), [[Rotkvarija (Žitni Trg)|Rotkvarija]], [[Podbara]], and [[Salajka]]. The areas of [[Sremska Kamenica]] and [[Petrovaradin]], located on the right bank of the Danube, were separate towns in the past, but today belong to the urban area of Novi Sad. [[Liman, Novi Sad|Liman]], as well as [[Bistrica (Novo Naselje)|Bistrica]], are neighbourhoods built during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, with contemporary style buildings and wide boulevards ([[Liman, Novi Sad|Liman]] was divided into four sections, numbered I–IV).

New neighbourhoods, like [[Liman, Novi Sad|Liman]], [[Detelinara]] and [[Bistrica, Novi Sad|Bistrica]], emerged from the fields and forests surrounding the city. Following World War II, tall residential buildings were constructed to house the huge influx of people leaving the country side. Many old houses in the city centre, from the [[Rotkvarija (Žitni Trg)|Rotkvarija]] and [[Bulevar]] neighbourhoods, were torn down in the 1950s and 1960s, to be replaced by multi-story buildings.  Since the city has experienced a major construction boom in the last 10 years, some neighbourhoods like [[Adamovićevo Naselje (Novi Sad)|Adamovićevo Naselje]] have completely been transformed.

Neighbourhoods with single-family homes are mostly located away from the city centre. [[Telep]], situated in the southwest, and [[Klisa, Serbia|Klisa]], in the north, are the oldest such districts. [[Adice]] and [[Veternik]], both located west of the downtown area, have significantly expanded during the last 15 years, partly due to the influx of Serbian refugees fleeing the [[Yugoslav wars]].

=== Suburbs ===
[[File:Petrovaradin, Novi Sad, 11 November 2023.png|thumb|upright=1.0|left|Beogradska street in [[Petrovaradin]], 2024.]]

While Novi Sad's urban municipalities, which include [[Petrovaradin]], [[Sremska Kamenica]] and Novi Sad proper, have a combined population of about 277,000, its suburban areas have approximately 65,000 inhabitants. Some 23.7% of the administrative city's total population resides in the suburbs, which consist of 12 settlements and 1 town.<ref name=Census>{{Serbian census 2011 |page=84-87}}</ref> The largest numbers live in [[Futog]] (pop. 20,000) and in [[Veternik]] (pop. 17,000) to the west. Both places have grown bigger over the years, especially during the 1990s, and have physically merged with the city.

Suburbs like Futog are officially classified as an '<nowiki/>''urban settlement'<nowiki/>'' (town), while other suburbs are mostly considered to be '<nowiki/>''rural''' (village). [[Ledinci]], [[Stari Ledinci]] and [[Bukovac, Novi Sad|Bukovac]] are all villages located on [[Fruška Gora]]'s slopes, with the last two having only one paved road. [[Stari Ledinci]] is the most isolated and least populated village belonging to Novi Sad's suburban areas.

Towns and villages in the adjacent municipalities of [[Sremski Karlovci]], [[Temerin]] and [[Beočin]] share the same public transportation system and are economically tied to Novi Sad.

[[File:Serbian National Theatre, January 2022.jpg|thumb|[[Serbian National Theatre]]]]
In the 19th and early 20th century, Novi Sad was the capital of [[Serbian culture]], earning it the nickname ''Serbian Athens''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jelena Sredanović |first1=Jelena |editor1-last=Noyce |editor1-first=Richard |title=Critical Mass: Printmaking Beyond the Edge |date=2010 |publisher=A & C Black |isbn=9781408109397 |page=86 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=36oRGNvIfpkC&pg=PA86}}</ref> During that time, many Serbian novelists, poets, jurists, and publishers had lived or worked in Novi Sad at some point in their career, including [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]], [[Mika Antić]], [[Đura Jakšić]] and [[Jovan Jovanović Zmaj]], among others.

== Economy ==
Novi Sad is the economic centre of [[Vojvodina]], the most fertile agricultural region in [[Serbia]]. The city also represents one of the largest economic and cultural hubs in Serbia.

Novi Sad had always been a developed city within the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. In 1981, its GDP per capita was 172% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book | title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju | year=1984 | edition=3rd | publisher=Sveučilišna naklada Liber | location=Zagreb | language=hr | editor1-first=Radovan | editor1-last=Radovinović | editor2-first=Ivan | editor2-last=Bertić}}</ref> During the 1990s, the city, like the rest of Serbia, was severely affected by an internationally imposed [[Embargo|trade embargo]] and hyperinflation of the [[Yugoslav dinar]]. The embargo, along with economic mismanagement, led to a decay or demise of once important industrial combines, such as ''Novkabel'' (electric cable industry), ''Pobeda'' (metal industry), ''Jugoalat'' (tools), ''Albus'' and ''HINS'' (chemical industry). Practically the only viable large facilities remaining today are the oil refinery, located northeast of the city, and the [[Thermal power station|thermal power plant]].

The economy of Novi Sad has mostly recovered from that period and grown strongly since 2001, shifting from an industry-driven economy to the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sector]]. The processes involved in [[privatization|privatizing]] state and society-owned enterprises, as well as strong private incentives, have increased the share of privately owned companies to over 95% in the district, with small and medium-size enterprises dominating the city's [[economic development]].<ref name="pkns2">{{cite web|url=http://www.rpkns.com/eng/oregionu.php?opstine=7|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112194104/http://www.rpkns.com/eng/oregionu.php?opstine=7|title=Regional Chamber Of Commerce Novi Sad|archive-date=12 January 2008|access-date=18 March 2015}}</ref>

The significance of Novi Sad as a financial centre is already proven, by being home to the national headquarters of numerous banks, such as [[Erste Bank Novi Sad|Erste Bank]], [[Vojvođanska banka a.d.|Vojvođanska banka]], and [[Crédit Agricole Srbija|Crédit Agricole]];<ref>[[National Bank of Serbia]] – [http://www.nbs.rs/english/banks/index.htm List of Banks]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} operating in Serbia.</ref> as well as the third largest insurance company in Serbia, [[DDOR Novi Sad]]. Furthermore, the city is home to major energy companies like [[Naftna Industrija Srbije]] oil company and [[Srbijagas]] gas company. It is also the seat of many farms for wheat production and [[trade]].
