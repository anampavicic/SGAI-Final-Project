==History ==
The area of Chatham-Kent is part of the traditional territory of the [[Odawa]], [[Potawatomi]], [[Ojibwe]] and [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] [[First Nations in Canada|First Nations]] of Canada.<ref name="plaque">{{cite web |url=https://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques_ABC/Plaque_ChathamKent29.html |title=McKee's Purchase |website=ontarioplaques.com |accessdate=November 13, 2022}}</ref> After the Treaty of Paris in 1763 ceded control of the area from the French to the British, it became part of the Territory of Quebec. The title to the Chatham-Kent area was surrendered to the British as part of the 1790 McKee's Purchase, (named for [[Alexander McKee]]) to provide land for settlers.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia |title=McKee's Purchase |first=John |last=Boileau |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/mckee-s-purchase |accessdate=November 13, 2022}}</ref> McKee's Purchase was designated an Event of National Historic Significance in Canada in 1931. A historical plaque for the purchase is located in Blenheim Park in Blenheim.<ref name="plaque"/> Indigenous persons remain resident in the area today at the Delaware Nation at Moraviantown and [[Walpole Island First Nation]].

European settlement of the former city of Chatham area began with a naval dockyard in 1792, at the fork of the [[Thames River (Ontario)|Thames River]] with McGregor's Creek. The town was named after [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]].  It was built as a naval dockyard, a characteristic shared by [[Chatham, Kent]], England. In England, the name Chatham came from the British root ''ceto'' and the Old English ''ham'' thus meaning a forest settlement.<ref name=glover>The Place Names of Kent, Judith Glover, 1976, Batsford. {{ISBN|0905270 614}}</ref> Following the [[American Revolution]] and the [[Gnadenhutten massacre]], a group of [[Christian Munsee]] settled in what is now the Moraviantown reserve. In the [[War of 1812]], the [[Battle of the Thames]] took place between Moraviantown and [[Thamesville, Ontario|Thamesville]] on October 5, 1813.

===Black population===
During the 19th century, the area was the northern [[Train station#Terminus|terminus]] of the [[Underground Railroad]]. As a result, Chatham-Kent is now part of the African-Canadian Heritage Tour. Josiah Henson Museum for African-Canadian History, formally known as [[Uncle Tom's Cabin Historic Site]] is a museum of the Dawn Settlement, established in 1841 by [[Josiah Henson]] near Dresden as refuge for the many slaves who escaped to Canada from the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uncletomscabin.org/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006105139/http://www.uncletomscabin.org/|url-status=dead|title=uncletomscabin.org|archivedate=October 6, 2016}}</ref> [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], the abolitionist, planned [[John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry|his raid on the Harpers Ferry Arsenal]] in Chatham and recruited local men to participate in the raid.

In 1846, the town of Chatham had a population of about 1,500, with part of the town being called Chatham North. There were four churches, a theatre, a weekly newspaper and a cricket club. The road between London and Amherstburg was open, and transportation by stagecoach was available. A fast boat also provided transportation to Detroit and Buffalo.

Before 1998, Kent County consisted of the [[township (Canada)|townships]] of [[Camden Township, Kent County, Ontario|Camden]], [[Chatham Township, Ontario|Chatham]], [[Dover Township, Ontario|Dover]], [[Harwich Township, Ontario|Harwich]], [[Howard Township, Ontario|Howard]], [[Orford Township, Ontario|Orford]], [[Raleigh Township, Ontario|Raleigh]], [[Romney Township, Ontario|Romney]], [[Tilbury East Township, Ontario|Tilbury East]] and [[Zone Township, Ontario|Zone]]. In some of Canada's earliest post-Confederation censuses, some residences in Kent County were incorrectly reported as being in [[Bothwell (Canadian electoral district)|Bothwell "County"]], which was a separate [[electoral district (Canada)|electoral district]] comprising parts of Kent and [[Lambton County, Ontario|Lambton]] counties but not a distinct county in its own right.

In 1998, the [[Kent County, Ontario|County of Kent]] and the [[Chatham, Ontario|city of Chatham]] were amalgamated by the Province of Ontario to form the Municipality of Chatham–Kent. Most services were also combined. Since then, bus service has begun to serve all of Chatham-Kent. Starting in 2007, routes were set up to include the former towns of [[Wallaceburg, Ontario|Wallaceburg]] and [[Dresden, Ontario|Dresden]]. Before 1998, each town had their own fire department. It then became the Chatham-Kent Fire Department upon amalgamation. The county also had separate police departments until 1998. The [[Chatham, Ontario|city of Chatham]], as well as the towns of Wallaceburg, Dresden, and [[Tilbury, Ontario|Tilbury]], each had their own departments. The Chatham-Kent Police Service was formed on September 1, 1998. Many residents opposed amalgamation, as 18 city councillors boycotted the official vote, and the final decision to amalgamate was imposed on the County by a provincial commissioner.<ref>Shreve, Ellwood.

Chatham-Kent has many historic festivals throughout the year, such as the [[Battle of Longwoods]] reenactment, which takes place on Labour Day weekend at Fairfield Museum on Longwoods Road. Chatham Kent is also home to many historic buildings which are part of an annual ghost tour offered each year at Halloween. The participants go on a guided walk of downtown while the guide informs them of various ghost stories tied to the local buildings in which they pass. Chatham-Kent was a major part of the [[Underground Railroad]] and as such hosts the [[South Buxton, Ontario|Buxton]] Homecoming each September. This celebrates the area's black culture and the roots laid by early black settlers in the Buxton area.

===Language===
Although most of the population of Chatham-Kent is English-speaking, a few of its communities and Catholic parishes were settled by francophone (French-speaking) farmers in the mid-nineteenth century. These include Pain Court, Tilbury and Grande Pointe, where French is still spoken by a significant percentage of the population. These communities are designated French language service areas under Ontario's ''[[French Language Services Act]]''.

Approximately 8,500 residents of Chatham-Kent have French as a mother tongue and 1,500 have French as their home language. [[Essex County, Ontario|Essex County]] also has a relatively large francophone population, especially in the municipality of [[Lakeshore, Ontario|Lakeshore]]. Together, Chatham–Kent and Essex Counties make up one of the concentrations of [[Franco-Ontarian]]s in the province of Ontario.

Both elementary and secondary francophone schools exist across the municipality. A French socio-cultural organization, ''La Girouette'', which is based in Chatham, promotes French-Canadian culture and language in the area.
