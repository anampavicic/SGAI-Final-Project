One of the largest urban centres in the region of [[Occitania (administrative region)|Occitania]], Montpellier is the prefecture of the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Hérault]]. At the 2020 census, 299,096 people lived in the city proper,<ref name="commune">{{cite web |url=https://statistiques-locales.insee.fr/#bbox=384932,5432335,89099,53882&c=indicator&i=pop_legales.popmun&s=2020&selcodgeo=34172&t=A01&view=map1 |title=Statistiques locales - Montpellier : Commune 2022 - Population municipale 2020 |author=INSEE |author-link=INSEE |access-date=2023-03-02}}</ref> while its [[Functional area (France)|metropolitan area]] had a population of 813,272.<ref name="AAV_pop" /> The inhabitants are called ''Montpelliérains''. 

In the Middle Ages, Montpellier was an important city of the [[Crown of Aragon]] (and was the birthplace of [[James I of Aragon|James I]]), and then of [[Kingdom of Majorca|Majorca]], before its sale to France in 1349. Established in 1220, the [[University of Montpellier]] is one of the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest universities in the world]] and has the oldest medical school still in operation, with notable alumni such as [[Petrarch]], [[Nostradamus]] and [[François Rabelais]]. Above the medieval city, the ancient [[citadel of Montpellier]] is a stronghold built in the seventeenth century by [[Louis XIII of France]].

Since the 1990s, Montpellier has experienced one of the strongest economic and [[Demographics of France|demographic growths]] in the country.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}} Its urban area has experienced the highest population growth in France since the year 2000. Numbering 70,000, students comprise nearly one-fourth of its population, one of the highest such proportions in Europe.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Montpellier Tourist Information and Montpellier Tourism|work=Montpellier Information and Tourism|url=http://www.montpellier.world-guides.com/|access-date=5 June 2010}}</ref> Its living environment, with one of Europe's largest pedestrian areas,<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-10-25|title=Itinerary of a walk in Montpellier|url=https://www.voyageurssansfrontieres.com/france-en/itinerary-of-a-walk-in-montpellier/|access-date=2020-10-31|website=Travelers without borders|language=en-US}}</ref> along with its rich cultural life and [[Mediterranean climate]], explains the enthusiasm for the city, which is nicknamed the "Gifted".

==Status==
Montpellier is the third-largest French city near the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast, behind [[Marseille]] and [[Nice]]. It is [[List of communes in France with over 20,000 inhabitants|the seventh-largest city of France]], and has also been the fastest-growing city in the country for 25&nbsp;years.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}

==History==
===Medieval period===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2022}}
[[File:Tour de la Babote Montpellier.JPG|thumb|left|Tour de la Babote.]]In the [[Early Middle Ages]], the nearby episcopal town of Maguelone was the major settlement in the area but raids by [[piracy|pirates]] encouraged settlement a little farther inland. In 737 [[Charles Martel]] destroyed [[Villeneuve-lès-Maguelone#History|Maguelone]].<ref name="EBMontpellier">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Montpellier |volume=18 |page=789 |short=1}}</ref>

Montpellier, first mentioned in a document of 985, was founded under a local [[Feudalism|feudal]] dynasty, the Guilhem, who combined two hamlets and built a castle and walls around the united settlement. The name is from medieval Latin ''mons pisleri'', "Woad Mountain" referring to the [[Isatis tinctoria|woad]] (Latin ''pastellus'', ''pestellus'') used for dyeing locally. There is no real "mountain" in the area, with the ''mons'' referring to a pile of stones.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iVRuDwAAQBAJ&q=%22mons+pislerius%22&pg=PT1172|title=The Concise Dictionary of World Place-Names|first=John|last=Everett-Heath|date=13 September 2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780192562432|via=Google Books}}</ref> In 986 the [[Lords of Montpellier]] begin with [[William I of Montpellier]]. In the 10th century the town consisted of two portions, Montpellier and Montpelliéret.<ref name="EBMontpellier" /> In 1160 the law school was active.<ref name="EBMontpellier" />
[[File:Château d'eau du Peyrou, Montpellier 06.jpg|left|thumb|Peyrou water tower|200x200px]]
The two surviving towers of the city walls, the ''Tour des Pins'' and the ''Tour de la Babotte'', were built later, around the year 1200. Montpellier came to prominence in the 12th century—as a trading centre, with trading links across the Mediterranean world, and a rich Jewish cultural life that flourished within traditions of tolerance of [[Muslims]], Jews and [[Cathar]]s—and later of its Protestants. [[William VIII of Montpellier]] gave freedom for all to teach medicine in Montpellier in 1180. The city's faculties of law and medicine were established in 1220 by Cardinal [[Conrad of Urach]], legate of [[Pope Honorius III]]; the medical faculty has, over the centuries, been one of the major centres for the teaching of medicine in Europe. This era marked the high point of Montpellier's prominence. The city became a possession of the [[Kings of Aragon]] in 1204 by the marriage of [[Peter II of Aragon]] with [[Marie of Montpellier]], who was given the city and its dependencies as part of her [[dowry]].

Montpellier gained a charter in 1204 when Peter and Marie confirmed the city's traditional freedoms and granted the city the right to choose twelve governing consuls annually. Under the Kings of Aragon, Montpellier became a very important city, a major economic centre and the primary centre for the spice trade in the Kingdom of France. It was the second or third most important city of France at that time, with some 40,000 inhabitants before the [[Black Death]]. Montpellier remained a possession of the crown of Aragon until it passed to [[James III of Majorca]], who sold the city to the French king [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]] in 1349, to raise funds for his ongoing struggle with [[Peter IV of Aragon]].

From the middle of the 14th century until the French Revolution (1789), Montpellier was part of the [[Languedoc|province of Languedoc]].

===Renaissance===
In the 14th century, [[Pope Urban VIII]] gave Montpellier a new monastery dedicated to [[Saint Peter]], noteworthy for the very unusual porch of its chapel, supported by two high, somewhat rocket-like towers. With its importance steadily increasing, the city finally gained a bishop, who moved from [[Maguelone]] in 1536, and the huge monastery chapel became a cathedral. In 1432, [[Jacques Cœur]] established himself in the city and it became an important economic centre, until 1481 when Marseilles overshadowed it in this role.

===After the Reformation===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2022}}
At the time of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in the 16th century, many of the inhabitants of Montpellier became Protestants (or [[Huguenots]] as they were known in France) and the city became a stronghold of Protestant resistance to the Catholic French crown. Montpellier was among the most important of the 66 {{lang|fr|villes de sûreté}} ('cities of protection' or 'protected cities') that the [[Edict of Nantes]] granted to the Huguenots. The city's political institutions and the university were all handed over to the Huguenots. 

Increasing tension with Paris led to King [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] [[Siege of Montpellier|besieging the city]] in 1622.  The city surrendered after a two-month siege.  Peace terms called for the dismantling of the city's fortifications and the building of the royal [[Citadel of Montpellier]] to secure the city for the government. The university and consulate were taken over by the Catholic party.  Even before the [[Edict of Alès]] in 1629, Protestant rule was dead and the {{lang|fr|ville de sûreté}} was no more.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] made Montpellier capital of [[Bas Languedoc]], and the town started to embellish itself, by building the [[Promenade du Peyrou]], the Esplanade and a large number of houses in the historic centre.

===French Revolution===

After the [[French Revolution]], the city became the capital of the much smaller Department of [[Hérault]].

===Modern history===
During the 19th century the city thrived on the wine culture that it was able to produce due to the abundance of sun throughout the year. The wine consumption in France allowed Montpellier's citizens to become very wealthy until in the 1890s the [[phylloxera]] induced fungal disease had spread amongst the vineyards and the people were no longer able to grow the grapes needed for wine.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.world-guides.com/europe/france/languedoc-roussillon/montpellier/montpellier_history.html |title=Montpellier History Facts and Timeline: Montpellier, Languedoc-Roussillon, France |website=world-guides.com |access-date=5 October 2018 }}</ref> After this the city had grown because it welcomed French repatriates from Algeria and other parts of northern Africa after [[Algerian War|Algeria's independence from France]]. In the 21st century Montpellier is between France's number seventh and eighth largest city. The city had another influx in population more recently, largely due to the student population, who make up about one-fourth of Montpellier's population. The school of medicine kickstarted the city's thriving university culture,<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/mar/13/montpellier-spotlight-development-mania-france-fastest-growing-city |title = Montpellier in the spotlight: development mania in France's fastest-growing city |last=Hoad|first=Phil |date=13 March 2017|website=The Guardian|access-date=5 October 2018 }}</ref> though many other universities have been well established there. The coastal city also benefited in the past 40 years from major construction programs such as [[Antigone, Montpellier|Antigone]], Port Marianne and Odysseum districts.

The city is situated on hilly ground {{Convert|10|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} inland from the Mediterranean coast, on the river [[Lez (river)|Lez]]. The name of the city, which was originally ''Monspessulanus'', is said to have stood for ''mont pelé'' (the naked hill, because the vegetation was poor), or ''le mont de la colline'' (the mount of the hill).

Montpellier is located {{Convert|170|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from [[Marseille]], {{Convert|242|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from [[Toulouse]], and {{Convert|748|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from Paris.

Montpellier's highest point is the Place du Peyrou, at an altitude of {{convert|57|m|0|abbr=on}}. The city is built on two hills, Montpellier and Montpelliéret, thus some of its streets have great differences of altitude. Some of its streets are also very narrow and old, which gives it a more intimate feel.

===Climate===
Montpellier has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csa''), with cool, damp winters, and hot, rather dry summers. The monthly mean ranges from {{convert|7.2|C|1|abbr=}} in January to {{convert|24.1|C|1|abbr=}} in July. Precipitation is around {{convert|630|mm|in|1|abbr=}}, and is greatest in fall and winter, but not absent in summer, either. Extreme temperatures have ranged from {{convert|-17.8|°C|2}} recorded on 5 February 1963 and up to {{convert|43.5|°C|1}} on 28 June 2019.

===History===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2022}}
The [[University of Montpellier]] is one of the oldest in the world, founded in 1160, and having been granted a charter in 1220 by Cardinal [[Conrad von Urach]] and confirmed by [[Pope Nicholas IV]] in a [[papal bull]] of 1289. It was suppressed during the [[French Revolution]] but was re-established in 1896.

It is not known exactly at what date the schools of literature were founded which developed into the Montpellier faculty of arts; it may be that they were a direct continuation of the [[Gallo-Roman]] schools. The school of law was founded by [[Placentinus]], a doctor from [[Bologna University]], who came to Montpellier in 1160, taught there during two different periods, and died there in 1192. With regard to the school of medicine, there were excellent physicians at Montpellier. The statutes given in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad, legate of [[Honorius III]], which were completed in 1240 by Pierre de Conques, placed this school under the direction of the [[Bishop of Maguelonne]]. [[Pope Nicholas IV]] issued a Bull in 1289, combining all the schools into a university, which was placed under the direction of the bishop, but which in fact enjoyed a large measure of autonomy.

Theology was at first taught in the convents, in which [[St. Anthony of Padua]], [[Raymond Lullus]], and the Dominican [[Bernard of Trilia|Bernard de la Treille]] lectured. Two letters of King John prove that a faculty of theology existed at Montpellier independently of the convents, in January 1350. By a Bull of 17 December 1421, [[Pope Martin V|Martin V]] granted canonical institution to this faculty and united it closely with the faculty of law. In the 16th century the faculty of theology disappeared for a time, when [[Calvinism]], in the reign of [[Henry II of France]], held complete possession of the city. It resumed its functions after [[Louis XIII]] had reestablished the royal power at Montpellier in 1622; but the rivalries of [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and [[Jesuits]] interfered seriously with the prosperity of the faculty, which disappeared at the Revolution. The faculty numbered among its illustrious pupils of law [[Petrarch]], who spent four years at Montpellier, and among its lecturers [[Guillaume de Nogaret]], chancellor to [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]], [[Guillaume de Grimoard]], afterwards pope under the name of Urban V, and [[Pedro de Luna]], [[antipope]] as Benedict XIII. But after the 15th century this faculty fell into decay, as did also the faculty of arts, although for a time, under [[Henry IV of France]], the latter faculty had among its lecturers [[Isaac Casaubon]].

The Montpellier school of medicine owed its success to the ruling of the Guilhems, lords of the town, by which any licensed physician might lecture there; there was no fixed limit to the number of teachers, lectures were multiplied, and there was a great wealth of teaching. [[Rabelais]] took his medical degrees at Montpellier. It was in this school that the biological theory of [[vitalism]], elaborated by [[Paul Joseph Barthez|Barthez]] (1734–1806), had its origin. The French Revolution did not interrupt the existence of the faculty of medicine.

The faculties of science and of letters were re-established in 1810; that of law in 1880. It was on the occasion of the sixth centenary of the university, celebrated in 1889, that the Government of France announced its intention—which has since been realized—of reorganizing the provincial universities in France.
