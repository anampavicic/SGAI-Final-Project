'''Jimma''' ({{Langx|om|Jimmaa}}) is the largest city in southwestern [[Oromia Region]], [[Ethiopia]]. It is a special zone of the Oromia Region and is surrounded by [[Jimma Zone]]. Prior to the 2007 census, Jimma was reorganized administratively as a special [[Zones of Ethiopia|Zone]].

== History ==
What is now Jimma's northern suburb of [[Jiren (city)|Jiren]] was the capital of the [[Kingdom of Jimma]]. Originally named ''Hirmata'', the city owed its importance in the 19th century to being located on the caravan route between [[Shewa]] and [[Kingdom of Kaffa|Kaffa]], as well as being only six miles from the palace of [[Abba Jifar II]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Bahru Zewde|title= A History of Modern Ethiopia|url= https://archive.org/details/historyofmoderne00bahr|url-access= registration|year= 2001|edition=second|publisher= James Currey|location= Oxford|isbn=0-85255-786-8|pages= 65f}}</ref>

According to Donald Levine, in the early 19th century the market attracted thousands of people from neighboring regions: "Oromo from Gojjam and Shoa, Oromo from all the Gibe Kingdoms and numerous representatives of the Lacustrine and Omotic groups, including Timbaro, Qabena, Kefa, Janjero, Welamo, Konta and several others".<ref>Donald N. Levine, ''Greater Ethiopia'', second edition (Chicago: University Press, 1974)</ref>

At the very beginning of the 20th century, the German explorer [[Oscar Neumann]] visited Jimma on his journey from the Somali coast through Ethiopia to the Sudan. As he observed, “Jimma is almost the richest land of Abyssinia; the inhabitants are pure, well-built Galla; they are nearly all Mohammedans, as is their king, Abba Jifar, a very clever man, who submitted to Menelik at the right time and, therefore, retained his country”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sciendo.com/article/10.2478/eas-2018-0003|title=Jimma Town: Foundation and Early Growth from ca. 1830 to 1936}}</ref>

The present town was developed on the [[Awetu River]] by the [[Italian East Africa|Italian colonial regime]] in the 1930s. At that time, with the goal of weakening the native [[Ethiopian Church]], the Italians intended to make Jimma an important center of [[Islam]]ic learning, and founded an academy to teach ''[[fiqh]]''.<ref>J. Spencer Trimingham, ''Islam in Ethiopia'' (Oxford: Geoffrey Cumberlege for the University Press, 1952), p. 137.</ref> In the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African fighting]] of [[World War II]] after their main force was defeated, the Italian garrison at Jimma was one of the last to surrender, holding out until July 1941.

Following the death of [[Abba Jifar II]] of Jimma in 1932, the Kingdom of Jimma was formally absorbed into Ethiopia. During the reorganization of the [[Provinces of Ethiopia|provinces]] in 1942, Jimma vanished into [[Kaffa Province]].<ref>Herbert S. Lewis, ''A Galla Monarchy: Jimma Abba Jifar, Ethiopia, 1830-1932'' (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1965), p. 56.</ref> [[Herbert S. Lewis]] states that in the early 1960s it was "the greatest market in all of south-western Ethiopia. On a good day in the dry season, it attracts up to 30,000 people. Jimma was the scene of a violent encounter which started in April 1975 between radical college students (known as ''zemacha'') sent to organize local peasants, who had benefited from [[Land reform in Ethiopia|land reform]], and local police, who had sided with local landowners. Students and peasant followers had imprisoned local small landowners, rich peasants and members of the local police force; this action led to further unrest, causing the [[Derg]] (the ruling [[Military dictatorship|junta]]) to send a special delegation to Jimma, which sided with the local police. In the end, 24 students were killed, more arrested, and the local ''zemacha'' camps closed.<ref>Marina and David Ottaway, ''Ethiopia: Empire in Revolution'' (New York: Africana, 1978), p. 73f</ref>

Days before the end of the [[Ethiopian Civil War]] in May 1991, the city was captured by the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]].

On 13 December 2006, the Ethiopian government announced that it had secured a loan of US$98 million from the [[African Development Bank]] to pave the 227 kilometers of highway between Jimma and [[Mizan Teferi]] to the southwest. The loan was to cover 64% of the 1,270.97 million [[Ethiopian birr|Birr]] budgeted for this project.<ref>[http://www.ethioembassy.org.uk/Archive/Newsletter%20Archive/Nov%20&%20Dec%202006/NovDec06P2.htm "Ethiopian Embassy Newsletter", Nov/Dec 2006, p.2]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Ethiopian Embassy to the UK website (accessed 11 January 2007)</ref>
