'''Marabá''' is a [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] in the state of [[Pará]], [[Brazil]]. Its greatest geographic reference is the confluence of two large rivers near the historic city center, the [[Itacaiunas River]] and the [[Tocantins River]], forming a "Y" if seen from space. It basically consists of six urban centers linked by five highways.

Marabá is the fourth-most-populous municipality in the state of Pará, approximately 283,542 inhabitants according to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]/2020, and the fourth largest [[GDP]] in the state of Pará, with US$1.543.254,34 according to the IDESP/2010.<ref>[http://www.idesp.pa.gov.br/pdf/pib/PIBMunicipal2010.pdf Produto Interno Bruto dos Municípios do estado do Pará em 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110012212/http://www.idesp.pa.gov.br/pdf/pib/PIBMunicipal2010.pdf |date=2013-11-10 }} - Instituto de Desenvolvimento Econômico, Social e Ambiental do Pará - 13 de março de 2012</ref> It's the main center of political, social, and economic development in southern of Pará and one of the most dynamic municipalities in Brazil.

Marabá has a strategic position and is crossed by five highways. It also has a large logistics infrastructure, with a port, airport, and railway. The municipality has a growing industrial park. The [[steel industry]] is especially important to Marabá's vast agricultural frontier. Marabá also has a strong trade and services sector.

Marabá is characterized by its broad mix of peoples and cultures that do justice to the meaning of the town's nickname: "Son of Miscegenation."

== Etymology ==
The word "Marabá" derives from the [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|indigenous]] vocable "Mayr-Abá", which simply means "son of the indigenous woman with a [[Caucasian race|white man]]."

A poem written by poet [[Gonçalves Dias]] inspired by the merchant Francisco Silva to its commercial name of "Casa Marabá" (Maraba House). This was located the banks of the Tocantins River, and served as a strategic business point for exchanging all kinds of products and services.

== History ==
The settlement of the river basin Itacaiunas played an important factor in shaping the city, because even though this region was later colonized by the [[Portuguese Empire]] in the sixteenth century, remained without a permanent settler occupation for almost 300 years. Only in 1894 is, in fact, the space was occupied by settlers.

=== Colonization ===
The first to participate in the colonization of the territory of Marabá, in 1894, were the political leaders who had escaped from political guerrillas in the northern [[Goiás Province|Province of Goiás]], specifically the city of [[Tocantinópolis|Boa Vista]].<ref>[http://www.marabaonline.com.br/maraba/links/gomesleitao.php Carlos Gomes Leitão] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515015200/http://www.marabaonline.com.br/maraba/links/gomesleitao.php |date=2014-05-15 }} - Maraba Online. {{in lang|pt}}</ref> One of those leaders was Carlos Leitao, who traveled with his group to the southeast of the province of Grão-Pará and established its first camp in downstream Itacaiunas River, in December 1894. A definitive village was established on the left bank of the Tocantins River, about 10&nbsp;km downstream from the other camp, the place that Carlos Leitao called "Burgo do Itacayúna" (Burgo's Itacayúna). After a few months, the extraction of rubber latex began in the "Burgo's Itacayúna" region.

In 1895 Carlos Gomes Leitão asks the President of the [[Grão-Pará Province|Province of Grão-Pará]], José Paes de Carvalho, funding for the extraction and commercialization of rubber in addition to getting drugs to be used specifically to combat [[tropical diseases]]. To get funding, Carlos Leitão disseminating information on the extraction of rubber in small colony of Burgo's Itacayúna and its surroundings. Immediately there is the first population explosion of the locality where the rubber tappers, fishermen and hunters settle in the village of Burgo.<ref name="Clipping Liberal">[http://sib.iesam-pa.edu.br/downloads/hemeroteca/ciencias_humanas/HST/HST1579.pdf ''Clipping de notícias do jornal "O Liberal" sobre o centenário de Marabá] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514235144/http://sib.iesam-pa.edu.br/downloads/hemeroteca/ciencias_humanas/HST/HST1579.pdf |date=2014-05-14 }} - Instituto de Estudos Superiores da Amazônia</ref>

=== Foundation of Pontal do Itacayúna ===
The merchant Francisco Coelho da Silva would have been the first to settle in the area downstream of Rio Itacaiunas, crucial to the foundation of the village of "Pontal do Itacayúna" (Pontal of Itacayúna). The goal of Francisco Silva, while riding the village of Pontal of Itacayúna, was to negotiate with the rubber tappers who sought to sell the rubber collected in the region.<ref name="Clipping Liberal"/>

The official historiography Francisco Silva assigns the authorship of the current name of the city. He had installed in the village of Pontal of Itacayúna a commercial point called "Casa Marabá" (House Marabá), which years later would be used to name the until then village Pontal of Itacayúna.<ref name="Clipping Liberal"/>

With the death of Colonel Carlos Leitão in 1903, the village of Burgo's Itacayúna is disabled and Leitão family along with other residents move to the village of Pontal do Itacayúna. In 1904 the village of the Pontal shall be called "Marabá" and host the borough, with the installation of the police detachment.<ref name="sobre marabá pmm">[http://maraba.pa.gov.br/sobre-maraba/ História] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515021115/http://maraba.pa.gov.br/sobre-maraba/ |date=2014-05-15 }} - Prefeitura de Marabá. {{in lang|pt}}</ref>

=== Formation of the municipality ===
[[File:Embarque de castanha em Marabá.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Shipment of [[Brazil nuts]] in small boats.]]
The economy of the village of Marabá grew considerably supported by the extractive base, anchored in exports of [[rubber]] and [[Brazil-nut]] to [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Europe]]an markets. The economic importance gained, influenced the political aspects, so that in the years 1908 to 1909 a major rebellion occurred in Maraba, called of "Revolta dos Galegos" (Revolt of the Galicians).<ref>MONTARROYOS, Heraldo Elias. [http://historiaehistoria.com.br/materia.cfm?tb=artigos&id=222 História Social e Econômica da Casa Marabá: Reconstruindo o Cotidiano de um Barracão na Amazônia Oriental entre 1898 e 1906] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515062622/http://historiaehistoria.com.br/materia.cfm?tb=artigos&id=222 |date=2014-05-15 }} - Revista História ''e''-História, 2013</ref> The rebellion was demanding political autonomy from the county of [[Baião, Pará|Baião]], and the low prices paid for rubber and the highest [[interest rate]] on loans for collecting nuts and rubber.<ref name="Souza">TEIXEIRA, M.

Blog A Urbe, 2013</ref>

Retaliating against the rebellion of Maraba the government of the province of Grão-Pará does not meet demands by emancipation. However the enormous pressure and influence of the local society has made the provincial government gave in and finally initiate negotiations for the creation of the municipality of Marabá.<ref name="Souza"/>

That culminated on February 27, 1913 Maraba achieved political autonomy and became a municipality. The first mayor of Maraba was the military Antonio Maia, who took office as appointed by the President of the Province of Grão-Pará.<ref name="Souza"/>

In subsequent years the migratory flow to the region of Marabá increased considerably. During the 1920s, immigrants moved to Maraba mainly to participate in the extraction and sale of Brazil nuts, [[andiroba]], [[Copaifera langsdorffii|copaiba oils]] and rubber. And from the 1930s moved to Maraba, in order to work in the diamond mines that were on the banks of the Tocantins River.<ref name="sobre marabá pmm"/>

In 1929, Marabá becomes illuminated by a power plant that operated the base from burning wood. In November 1935 the local airport is opened and the first plane lands in this. Maraba in this period consists of 450 houses and 1.500 inhabitants fixed.<ref name="sobre marabá pmm"/>

=== The 1970s ===
With the construction of Highway PA-70, in 1969, Maraba is connected to the [[Belém-Brasília Highway]]. The implementation of road infrastructure was part of the [[Brazilian military government]]'s strategy to integrate the [[Amazon region]] to the rest of the country. All this was part of the integration strategy of the Amazon territory, especially the region of Marabá, where was undertaken mainly the official plan of agricultural colonization, the construction of the [[Tucuruí Dam|Tucuruí Hydroelectric Power]], the implementation of "Projeto Grande Carajás" ([[Greater Carajas Project]]), and even the discovery of large gold deposits of the [[Serra Pelada]]. All these projects were centered in Marabá, and contributed to the economic and population boom that occurred in the city between 1970 and 1980.<ref name="Idelma">DA SILVA, Idelma Santiago. [http://www.ufg.br/this2/uploads/files/112/Idelma_Santiago_da_Silva.pdf Migração e Cultura no Sudeste do Pará]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} - Universidade Federal de Goiás, 2010</ref>

In 1970 the city was declared a National Security Area (legal position allowing direct intervention of the Brazilian central government), a condition that lasted until the end of the Brazilian military dictatorship in 1985.<ref name="sobre marabá pmm"/> Besides having strategic importance to the policy of national integration, Marabá region was the only region of Brazil where there was fighting between the army and the [[PCdoB#The Araguaia Guerrilla .281969-1976.29|guerrillas of the PCdoB party]] who want to topple the military regime and establish a communist regime in Brazil. Then performed an [[Araguaia guerrilla]] movement, which forced the Brazilian government to Marabá to send a large contingent of troops of the [[Brazilian Army]]. The city has become since then one of the bases for military operations troops of the [[Brazilian Armed Forces]].<ref>NASCIMENTO, Durbens.

In 1970 it launched the "Programa de Integração Nacional" (National Integration Program), which, among other things, provided for the construction of the [[Trans-Amazon Highway]], whose first section opened in 1971, along with the creation of a post of the [[INCRA|National Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform]] in Marabá.<ref name="Idelma"/> With the completion of construction of the Trans-Amazon Highway, the flow of immigrants towards Maraba became very large, and in less than a decade the city has been radically transformed, from a small urban center on the banks of the Tocantins River (in Maraba time had only 20,000 inhabitants), a main city in the region with over 100,000 inhabitants.<ref name="pin rodovias">[http://www.usp.br/fau/cursos/graduacao/arq_urbanismo/disciplinas/aup0270/6t-alun/2010/m10/10-loureiro.pdf O Plano de Integração Nacional de 1970 e as rodovias na Amazônia] - FAU/Universidade de São Paulo</ref>

=== The 1980s ===
In 1980 the city was devastated by the biggest flood in its history, when the Tocantins River rose 17.42 meters. As a result, there was a redesign of the city's expansion, with the construction of urban areas planned of the "Cidade Nova" (New City) and "Nova Marabá" (New Marabá),  to the detriment of traditional urban area of the "Velha Marabá" (Old Marabá). New urban areas have also emerged over the decade, highlighting the "São Félix" (St. Félix) and the "Morada Nova" (New Morada).<ref>[http://www.cbmet.com/cbm-files/14-1b5c3e3f6e34f1ca974cb06dd7bf1c6c.pdf Variabilidade na precipitação na Amazônia: Implicações socioeconômicas] - Congresso Brasileiro de Meteorologia</ref>

In 1984, comes into operation the [[Carajás Railway]], which has Marabá as center of operations; in 1988 and come into operation the first two [[steel mill]]s for the production of [[pig iron]].<ref name="beneficiosgusa">[http://www.sindiferpa.com.br/polo/polo20080506.pdf Siderúrgicas aquecem economia regional] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029104830/http://www.sindiferpa.com.br/polo/polo20080506.pdf |date=2012-10-29 }} - Revista Pólo Sustentável</ref>

In 1987 there was a conflict that became known as the Massacre of St. Boniface. The battle took place between the miners of Serra Pelada and the battalion of the "Polícia Militar" (Military Police of the [[Pará|state of Pará]]), with the support of the Brazilian Army. The event that preceded the massacre was blocking access to the [[Mixed Bridge of Marabá]], in demonstration of the reopening of Serra Pelada mine and the lowering of the mining pit. A Police battalion was sent to unlock the bridge, but on reaching the spot shot with firearms against protesters to force their withdrawal. Officially nine people died in the conflict.<ref name="sbonifacio">[http://estadao.br.msn.com/ultimas-noticias/artigo.aspx?cp-documentid=26824114 Guerra de São Bonifácio] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517133859/http://estadao.br.msn.com/ultimas-noticias/artigo.aspx?cp-documentid=26824114 |date=2014-05-17 }} - MSN Estadão</ref>

== Geography ==

Occupying an area of 15,092,268&nbsp;km², Marabá counts, in 2017, with 271,594 inhabitants, being the tenth most populous municipality of the North region of Brazil. The municipal seat has the following geographical coordinates: 05º 21 '54 "South latitude and 049º 07' 24" longitude WGr. Located in southeastern Pará, in the Marabá microregion, it is bordered by the municipalities of: [[Novo Repartimento]], [[Itupiranga]], [[Nova Ipixuna]] and [[Rondon do Pará]] (to the north); [[São Geraldo do Araguaia]], [[Eldorado dos Carajás]], [[Curionópolis]] and [[Parauapebas]] (to the south); [[Bom Jesus do Tocantins, Pará|Bom Jesus do Tocantins]], [[São João do Araguaia]] and [[São Domingos do Araguaia]] (to the east); and [[São Félix do Xingu]] (to the west).

The topography of the municipality of Marabá presents the highest altitudes in the Southeast region of Pará, through the [[Carajás Mountains|Carajás]], Sereno, Buritirama, Paredão, Encontro, Gray and Misteriosa mountains. Of this complex, stands out the Carajás mountain range, like the one of greater size. However, it is in the Serra do Cinzento that the maximum altitude of the municipality of Marabá is found, with 792 meters. The Carajás, Cinzento and Buritirana mountains are located in conservation areas, under federal jurisdiction, called the [[Tapirapé-Aquiri National Forest]] ( {{convert|196,504|ha}} sustainable use conservation unit created in 1989.<ref>{{citation|ref={{harvid|FLONA do Tapirapé-Aquiri – ISA}}|language=pt|title=FLONA do Tapirapé-Aquiri|publisher=ISA: Instituto Socioambiental |url=https://uc.socioambiental.org/uc/6634|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref>) and the [[Tapirapé Biological Reserve]], where several caves are found. Its forms of relief are encompassed by the morphostructural unit denominated Peripheral Depression of the South of Pará, where they dominate the amazonian plateaus.

The vegetation cover of the municipality of Marabá is quite diverse. The fitofisionomy of the forests of the municipality of Marabá is characterized by three types: the open ombrophylous forest, the dense ombrophylous forest and the anthropic areas. In the urban area of Marabá, the anthropic forests predominate. Because of its diverse nature, the municipality holds one of the largest natural heritage sites in Brazil, housing large forest reserves such as the [[Tapirapé Biological Reserve]], with 103,000 ha (1,030&nbsp;km²), and the [[Tapirapé-Aquiri National Forest]] with 190,000 hectares ha (1,900&nbsp;km²), in addition to the Mãe Maria Indigenous Land, with 64,488,416 ha (644.88&nbsp;km²), which is close to the municipal seat of Marabá, belonging to the municipality of Bom Jesus do Tocantins.

Marabá is located in a low altitude area in the connexion of two rivers - [[Itacaiúnas River|Itacaiúnas]] and [[Tocantins River|Tocantins]] - and suffers from annual floods due to the topography and direct influence of four rivers: Itacaiunas, Tocantins, Tauarizinho and [[Sororó River|Sororó]]. In addition to the basins related to these rivers, the municipality is inserted in the basins of the rivers Aquiri, Tapirape, Gray, Black, Parauapebas and Red. Of these, the basins of the Tapirapé, Cinzento and Preto rivers are included totally in the area of the municipality. The basin of Itacaiúnas stands out for bathing the whole municipality, in whose mouth is the municipal headquarters of Marabá and covers the largest area, that is, 5,383.4&nbsp;km².

[[File:Jardins da Orla do Tocantins, em Marabá, em 2011.jpg|right|thumb|200px|trade in Maraba.]]
The municipality of Maraba experienced various economic cycles. Until the early 1980s economy was based on the extraction plant. At first revolved around the extraction of [[latex rubber]], whose lucrative attracted large numbers of the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]]. Since the late nineteenth century (1892) until the late 1940s, was marked by the extraction of the [[rubber boom]] that has contributed greatly to the economy of the city and the region, however, the rubber crisis led the council to a new cycle . This time, the cycle of Brazil nuts, which for years led the municipal economy. There was also the cycle of diamonds between 1920 and 1940, which were mainly found on the river Tocantins. With the discovery of [[Serra Pelada]] Maraba went through cycles of  mining mostly the extraction of gold.

Since the early 1970s installation of the Grande Carajás project and steel industries diversified and boosted the local economy.

=== Primary sector ===
Today, Maraba is the economic center and a vast administrative region of the Amazon agricultural frontier ", the city has one of the most significant economic growth in the country. Livestock based on cattle ranching is an activity of great importance for the municipality, and ensure the livelihoods of the population, provides the regional and local development by creating large scale, and is marketed in different Brazilian regions and abroad. The herd area is highlighted by its superior quality, being one of the most important cattle herds of the state, a result arising from the use of advanced technology in the selection and fertilization. It has also herds of pigs, horses, sheep and poultry

The fishing sector also has a key role in local economic base by exporting its surplus for the entire north and northeast. Agriculture is diversified, with production cereals, pulses and oilseeds such as corn, rice and beans, fruits such as bananas and [[acai]], and logging

=== Secondary sector ===
[[File:SteelMill interior.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Inside a steel plant.]]
Through the Industrial Development Company of Para - CDI, was installed at the end of the eighties, in an area of 1,300 hectares, the industrial district of Maraba - DIM, to create the base of a steel pole targeting the Carajas iron ore, exploited by the mining company Vale.

Metallurgical Industries and intense livestock activity, accounted for a large environmental devastation in the region. The activity of the [[steel industry]] requires large amounts of coal, leading to a devastation of native forests. As a result of public pressure the industries were forced to change its production model, investing in reforestation and charcoal production through the babassu coconut palm.

Besides, to have more than 200 industries, and the steel (pig iron) most important, second is the timber industry and the manufacture of tiles and bricks.

* Cidade Nova
* Industrial
* Morada Nova
* Nova Marabá
* São Félix
* Velha Marabá

== Infrastructure ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2023}}
Marabá has a significant infrastructure compared to the municipalities of the [[Carajás (proposed Brazilian state)|Carajás region]], but compared to other medium cities in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, it is far below this level.

The service of water and sewage of Marabá is made by Sanitation Company of Pará (''Companhia de Saneamento do Pará'' - ''Cosanpa''). The water consumed by the inhabitants of Marabá comes from the Tocantins and Itacaiunas rivers, which goes through treatment in the municipal water treatment plants.

The electric power is provided by the company Power Plants of Pará (''Centrais Elétricas do Pará'' - ''Celpa''), which has four substations, one in the neighborhood of Folha 19, one in the Jardim Vitória neighborhood, one in the Gabriel Pimenta neighborhood (Morada Nova district) and another in the Industrial district. The substation located in the district of Morada Nova, is the distribution center of the North-South network of the [[Eletrobrás]] system, which supplies power to the [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast of Brazil]].

In December 2017, Marabá had 53 banks and financial establishments, between branches and service stations, with credit operations at 288 112,00 thousand reais (2008), and savings of 109,804 thousand reais (2008), in addition to nine agencies and a regional Post Office.

=== Education ===
Marabá counts on schools in practically all the regions of the municipality, however, it is far from being among its best indicators. The schools in the state network have infra-structure below the ideal, and are mostly scrapped, mainly in the rural area. The municipal school network has schools in better conditions reaching the goal of the IDEB 2015 for the municipality (4.1), however, in the general assessment according to the Public Prosecutor's Office, education is still poor quality.

Regarding professional and higher education, the municipality counts about 30 units of education, a relatively high number, compared to municipalities that are not capitals in the northern region of Brazil. The public universities maintain 7 campus and poles in the municipality, with emphasis on the [[Federal University of Southern and Southeastern Pará]], the [[Pará State University]] and the [[Federal Institute of Pará]] (the latter with the path of becoming the Federal Institute of the South and Southeast of Pará). With this profile, Marabá is considered the first locality of the interior of the Amazon with profile of "polo/university city".
