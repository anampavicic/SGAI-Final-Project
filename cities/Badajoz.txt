'''Badajoz''' ({{IPA|es|baðaˈxoθ|lang|Pronunciation of Badajoz in Spanish.ogg}}; formerly written ''Badajos'' in English) is the capital of the [[Province of Badajoz]] in the [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of [[Extremadura]], [[Spain]]. It is situated close to the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Portugal–Spain border|border]], on the left bank of the river [[Guadiana]]. The population in 2011 was 151,565.

Badajoz was conquered by the [[Moors]] in the 8th century and re-founded as Baṭalyaws, and later in the 11th century the city became the seat of a separate Moorish kingdom, the [[Taifa of Badajoz]]. After the [[Reconquista]], the area was disputed between Spain and Portugal for several centuries with alternating control resulting in several wars including the [[War of the Spanish Succession|Spanish War of Succession]] (1705), the [[Peninsular War]] (1808–1811), the [[Siege of Badajoz (1812)|Storming of Badajoz]] (1812), and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936). [[Spanish history]] is largely reflected in the town.

Badajoz is the [[Episcopal see|see]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mérida-Badajoz]]. Prior to the merger of the Diocese of Mérida and the Diocese of Badajoz, Badajoz was the see of the Diocese of Badajoz from the bishopric's inception in 1255. The city has a degree of eminence, crowned as it is by the ruins of the Moorish castle [[Alcazaba of Badajoz]] and overlooking the [[Guadiana]] river, which flows between the castle-hill and the powerfully armed fort of San Cristobal. The architecture of Badajoz is indicative of its tempestuous history; even the [[Badajoz Cathedral]], built in 1238, resembles a fortress, with its massive walls. It is served by [[Badajoz Railway Station]] and [[Badajoz Airport]].

==History==
{{For timeline}}

===Ancient times===
Archaeological finds unearthed in the Badajoz area have been dated to the [[Bronze Age]]. [[Megalithic]] tombs are dated as far back as 4000 BC,{{Sfn|Tarlow|Nilsson Stutz|2013|p=377}} while many of the [[stele]]s found are from the [[Late Bronze Age]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spain.info/en/que-quieres/arte/museos/badajoz/museo_arqueologico_provincial_de_badajoz.html|title=Spain.info|publisher=Spain.info|access-date=12 July 2013|archive-date=December 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201203336/http://www.spain.info/en/que-quieres/arte/museos/badajoz/museo_arqueologico_provincial_de_badajoz.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Other finds include weapons such as axes and swords, everyday items of pottery and utensils, and various items of jewellery such as bracelets. Archaeological excavations have revealed remnants from the [[Lower Paleolithic]] period. Artifacts have also been found at the [[Rome|Roman]] town of [[Colonia Civitas Pacensis]] in the Badajoz area, although a significant number of larger artifacts were found in [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cajaespana.es/pubweb/decyle.nsf/FE3F7800571009E6C12578720023996E/$File/06015.PDF?OpenElement|title=DATOS ECONÓMICOS Y SOCIALES|publisher=Cajaespana.es|access-date=12 July 2013|language=es|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405004518/http://www.cajaespana.es/pubweb/decyle.nsf/FE3F7800571009E6C12578720023996E/$File/06015.PDF?OpenElement|archive-date=April 5, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>{{Sfn|Ring|Salkin|La Boda|1995|p=72}}

With the invasion of the Romans, which started in 218 BC during the [[Second Punic War]], Badajoz and [[Extremadura]] became part of the administrative district called [[Hispania Ulterior]] (Farther Spain), which was later divided by Emperor [[Augustus]] into Hispania Ulterior Baetica and Hispania Ulterior Lusitania; Badajoz became part of Lusitania.{{Sfn|Erskine|2012|p=329}} Though the settlement is not mentioned in Roman history, Roman villas such as the La Cocosa Villa have been discovered in the area, while [[Visigothic Spain|Visigothic]] constructions have also been found in the vicinity.{{sfn|Glick|1995|p=6}}

===Founding to Middle Ages===
[[File:Ibn Marwan.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Statue of [[Ibn Marwan]] in Badajoz]]
Badajoz attained importance during the reign of Moorish rulers such as the [[Umayyad]] caliphs of [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]], and the [[Almoravids]] and [[Almohads]] of North Africa. From the 8th century, the Umayyad dynasty controlled the region until the early 11th century.{{Sfn|Ring|Salkin|La Boda|1995|p=73}} The official foundation of Badajoz was laid by the Muladi nobleman [[Ibn Marwan]], around 875,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aytobadajoz.es/es/ayto/historia|title=Historia (History)|language=es|access-date=22 July 2013|publisher=Ayuntamiento de Badajoz|archive-date=January 15, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210115135230/https://www.aytobadajoz.es/es/ayto/historia|url-status=live}}</ref> after he had been expelled from Mérida.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|1983|p=113}} Under Ibn Marwan, the city was the seat of an effective autonomous rebel state which was quenched only in the 10th century. In 1021 (or possibly 1031{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=181}}), it became the capital of a small Muslim kingdom, the [[Taifa of Badajoz]];{{Sfn|Ring|Salkin|La Boda|1995|p=72}} with some 25,000 inhabitants.{{Sfn|Ring|Salkin|La Boda|1995|p=73}} Badajoz was known as ''Baṭalyaws'' ({{langx|ar|بَطَلْيَوْس}}) during Muslim rule, from which its present name gradually evolved. The invasion of Badajoz by Christian rulers in 1086 under [[Alfonso VI of León]], overturned the rule of the [[Moors]]. In addition to an invasion by the Almoravids of Morocco in 1067, Badajoz was later invaded by the Almohads in 1147.{{Sfn|Ring|Salkin|La Boda|1995|p=74}}

Badajoz was captured by [[Alfonso IX of León]] on 19 March 1230.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turismobadajoz.es/es/accordion-a/iglesias-y-conventos/item/65-convento-de-san-jos%C3%A9-adoratrices|title=Convento de San José (Adoratrices)|publisher=Turismobadajoz.es|language=es|access-date=12 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128120056/http://www.turismobadajoz.es/es/accordion-a/iglesias-y-conventos/item/65-convento-de-san-jos%C3%A9-adoratrices|archive-date=November 28, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Shortly after its conquest, in the time of [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X the Wise of Castile]], a [[Episcopal see|bishopric see]] was established and work was initiated on the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista. In 1336, during the reign of [[Alfonso XI of Castile]], the troops of King [[Afonso IV of Portugal]] besieged the city.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|Kagay|Vann|1998|p=154}} However, soon afterwards,{{sfn|O'Callaghan|Kagay|Vann|1998|p=154}} the Castilian-Leonese troops, which included [[Pedro Ponce de León the Elder]] and [[Juan Alonso Pérez de Guzmán y Coronel]], second lord of [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]] and son of [[Alonso Pérez de Guzmán]], defeated the troops of Afonso IV in the [[Battle of Villanueva de Barcarrota]]. Their victory forced the king of Portugal to desert the city and it fell into neglect.

In medieval times, the Sánchez de Badajoz family dominated the area as the lords of [[Barcarrota]], near Badajoz, acquiring the property in 1369 when it was granted to [[Fernán Sánchez de Badajoz]] by [[Henry II of Castile|Enrique II]].{{sfn|Gallagher|1968|p=8}} They temporarily lost Barcarrota to the Portuguese but soon regained control. Fernán Sánchez's grandson of the same name, son of Garci Sánchez de Badajoz, was both lord of Barcarrota and Mayor of Badajoz in 1434.{{sfn|Gallagher|1968|p=8}} [[Garci Sánchez de Badajoz]], probably his son, was a notable writer, and one of his descendants, [[Diego Sánchez de Badajoz]], was also a notable playwright; his ''Recopilación en metro'' was published posthumously in 1554.{{sfn|Wiltrout|1987|p=65}}
[[File:Luis de Morales 001.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Luis de Morales]] painting ''Mother and Child'']]
From the 11th century-1492, a [[Jewish]] community existed in Badajoz.<ref>{{cite web |title=Badajoz, Spain |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/badajoz# |website=Jewish Virtual Library |access-date=25 June 2024}}</ref>

The first hospital was founded in the town by Bishop Fray Pedro de Silva in 1485.{{sfn|Díaz y Pérez|1887|p=551}} Those affected by the plague epidemic were treated here in 1506. During the 16th century the city experienced a cultural renaissance thanks to personalities such as the painter [[Luis de Morales]], the composer [[Juan Vásquez (composer)|Juan Vázquez]], the humanist [[Rodrigo Dosma]], the poet Joaquin Romero de Cepeda, the playwright [[Diego Sánchez de Badajoz]], the Dominican mystic [[Fray Luis de Granada]] and architect [[Gaspar Méndez]]. In 1524, a board meeting between representatives of Spain and Portugal took place in the Old Town Hall in the city to clarify the status of their territorial arrangements, attended by [[Ferdinand Columbus|Hernando Colón]], [[Juan Vespucio]], [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastián Caboto]], [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], [[Diogo Ribeiro (cartographer)|Diego Ribeiro]] and [[Esteban Gómez]].{{sfn|Vallín|1899|p=93}} 

With reason to assert their rights to the Portuguese Crown, [[Philip II of Spain]] briefly moved his court to Badajoz in August 1580. Queen [[Anne of Austria, Queen of Spain|Anne of Austria]] died in the city two months later, and on 5 December 1580, Philip moved out of the city.{{sfn|Deutscher|2013|p=36}}{{sfn|Danvers|1988|p=39}} From 1580 until 1640, as a result of the absence of war, the city flourished once again. According to the historian Vicente Navarro del Castillo, some 428 residents of Badajoz contributed to the Spanish conquest of the Americas, including conquistadors [https://www.marcialpons.es/libros/fuentes-del-archivo-general-de-indias-para-el-estudio-del-conquistador-diego-valades/9788493960896/ Diego de Valadés],<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.marcialpons.es/libros/fuentes-del-archivo-general-de-indias-para-el-estudio-del-conquistador-diego-valades/9788493960896/ |title=Fuentes del Archivo General de Indias para el estudio del conquistador Diego Valadés |language=es}}</ref> [[Pedro de Alvarado]], [[Luis de Moscoso]], and [[Sebastián Garcilaso de la Vega y Vargas]] (father of [[Inca Garcilaso]]).

===1660–1811===
[[File:Badajoz 16xx.jpg|thumb|left|Depiction of Badajoz in the mid-1600s]]

The battle for control of the town and its fortress continued with attacks by the Portuguese in 1660. In 1705, during the Spanish War of Succession, Badajoz was controlled by the Allies following the death of the heirless King Charles II. It was taken by Spain, prompting Philip V, grandson of Louis XIV of France, to take over the reins of Spain itself.{{Sfn|Ring|Salkin|La Boda|1995|p=72}}{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=181}} In 1715 Portugal signed a peace agreement with Spain and surrendered its claims to Badajoz in lieu of Spain's cession of Sacramento territory in the [[La Plata]] area in South America.{{Sfn|Frey|Frey|1995|p=108}} The [[Peace Treaty of Badajoz]] was signed between Spain and Portugal on 6 June 1801.<ref name="Olivenca">{{cite web|url=http://www.olivenca.org/litigio_uk.htm|title=Peace Treaty of Badajoz between Portugal|publisher=Grupos de Amigos de Olivenca|access-date=9 July 2013|archive-date=April 5, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405005601/http://www.olivenca.org/litigio_uk.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> The Portuguese, feeling that an attack by French troops stationed in [[Ciudad Rodrigo]] was imminent, agreed to cede [[Olivenza]] to Spain and declared that it would close its ports to British ships.<ref name="Olivenca"/> This agreement was revoked in 1807 as its terms were breached when the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (October 1807)|Treaty of Fontainbleau]] was signed between Spain and France on 27 October 1807.<ref name="Olivenca"/>

During the [[Peninsular War]], Badajoz was unsuccessfully attacked by the French in 1808 and 1809. However, on 10 March 1811, the Spanish commander, José Imaz, was bribed into surrendering to a French force under Marshal [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=181}} A British and Portuguese army, commanded by Marshal [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|Beresford]], endeavoured to retake it and on 16 May 1811 defeated a relieving force at [[Battle of Albuera|Albuera]], but the siege was abandoned the following month.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=181}}

In 1812, [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]], [[Earl of Wellington]] (and future duke), again attempted to take Badajoz, which had a French garrison of about 5,000 men.{{sfn|MacFarlane|2004|p=127}} Siege operations commenced on 16 March; by early April, there were three practicable breaches {{efn|A practicable breach was one where two soldiers could get through side by side without needing to use their hands<ref name="Melón 2012 242–244">{{Cite book|chapter-url=http://www.historiauex.es/data/catalogues/142/docs/1375529077.pdf|pages=242–244|first=Miguel Ángel|last=Melón|title=Los sitios en la guerra de la Independencia: La lucha en las ciudades|year=2012|editor-first=Gonzalo|editor-last=Butró Prída|editor-first2=Pedro|editor-last2=Rújula|chapter=Badajoz (1811–1812) La resistencia en la frontera|publisher=[[University of Cádiz|Servicio de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Cádiz]]|isbn=978-84-9828-393-8|location=Cádiz}}</ref>}} in the walls.

[[Pedro Caro, 3rd Marquis of la Romana]], died at Badajoz on 23 January 1811 in a fit of apoplexy, seized at the moment when he was leaving his house to concert a plan of military operations with Lord Wellington. In the Siege of Badajoz, a detachment of the [[45th (Nottinghamshire) Regiment of Foot|45th Regiment of Foot]] (later amalgamated with the [[95th (Derbyshire) Regiment of Foot|95th]] to form the [[Sherwood Foresters]] Regiment) succeeded in getting into the castle first and the red [[coatee]] of Lt. James MacPherson of the 45th regiment was hoisted in place of the French flag to indicate the fall of the castle. This feat is commemorated on 6 April each year, when red jackets are flown on regimental flag staffs and at [[Nottingham Castle]]. Volume 23 of the ''Museum of Foreign Literature, Science and Art'', published in 1833, described Badajoz as "one of the richest and most beautiful towns in the south of Spain, whose inhabitants had witnessed its siege in silent terror for one and twenty days, and who had been shocked by the frightful massacre."<ref>{{cite book|title=Museum of Foreign Literature, Science and Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tsXAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA612|access-date=9 July 2013|year=1833|publisher=E.

The [[Spanish Civil War]] in Badajoz in the 1930s was a gruesome affair.{{Sfn|Ring|Salkin|La Boda|1995|p=74}} During the war, Badajoz was taken by the Nationalists in the [[Battle of Badajoz (1936)|Battle of Badajoz]]. Infamously, several thousand of the town's inhabitants, both men and women, were taken to the town's [[bullring]] after the battle and after machine guns were set up on the barriers around the ring, an indiscriminate slaughter began. On 14 August 1936, hundreds of Republicans were shot at the Plaza de Toros.{{sfn|Kern|1995|p=179}} In the course of the night, another 1,200 were brought in. Overall it is estimated that over 4,000 people were murdered by the Nationalists after the battle.{{sfn|Preston|2012|p=318}} Even those who tried to cross the Portuguese border were captured and sent back to Badajoz.{{Sfn|Ring|Salkin|La Boda|1995|p=74}} The troops who committed the killings at Badajoz were under the command of general [[Juan Yagüe]], who, after the civil war, was appointed Minister of Aviation by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]].

===Modern history===
After the war, the town continued to grow, although since 1960 it has suffered significant migrations to other Spanish regions and other European countries. During the following decades, the predominant economic activity of the city increasingly fell within the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sector]], and today Badajoz is a major commercial centre in southwestern Spain and an important bridge between Spain and Portugal for trade and cultural relations. On 6 November 1997, a heavy flood devastated several neighbourhoods of the city, causing the deaths of 21 people and devastating the property of hundreds.<ref name="flood">{{cite web|url=http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/29/70/90/PDF/adgeo-16-73-2008.pdf|title=The flood event that affected Badajoz in November 1997|publisher=Advances in GeoSciences|date=9 April 2008|access-date=12 July 2013|archive-date=April 5, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405000858/http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/29/70/90/PDF/adgeo-16-73-2008.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> The catastrophe was caused by the Atlantic extratropical trough crossing the Iberian Peninsula and inundating the Rivilla and Calamon brooks, which are usually dry.<ref name="flood"/> The neighbourhood of Cerro de Reyes, near the confluence of both streams, received the brunt of the damage caused by the flood.<ref name="flood"/>

== Geography ==
[[File:SpainGuadianaBasin.png|thumb|right|[[Guadiana River]] Basin showing location of Badajoz]]
Badajoz is located in the southwest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] on the bank of the [[Guadiana River]] on the border with Portugal.{{sfn|Frey|Frey|1995|p=25}} It is the capital city of the province of the same name.{{Sfn|Ring|Salkin|La Boda|1995|p=72}} It is {{convert|61|km}} from [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]], {{convert|89|km}} from [[Cáceres, Spain|Cáceres]], {{convert|217|km}} from [[Seville]], {{convert|227|km}} east of [[Lisbon]], and {{convert|406|km}} from [[Madrid]]. The newer part of the city is on the left bank of the river, with several industrial estates and the university hospital.

Although the city is the most populated of Extremadura, it has a relatively low population density (102.30 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>), due to the extension of its municipality, one of the largest in Spain, with an area of 1,470&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. In addition to the metropolitan centre the population includes districts, neighborhoods and towns with small populations, the most populous of which is [[Guadiana, Badajoz|Guadiana]], which had 2,524 people in 2012, but gained independence on 17 February 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.badajoz7dias.com/lector.php?id_articulo=1237|title=Guadiana del Caudillo celebra su primer año como independiente|publisher=Badajoz7dias.com|access-date=11 July 2013|language=es|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729084931/http://badajoz7dias.com/lector.php?id_articulo=1237|archive-date=July 29, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Administration==
Badajoz was the birthplace of the statesman [[Manuel de Godoy]], the duke of Alcudia (1767–1851). Many of the provincial administration buildings are located in Badajoz, as well as the government buildings of the municipal administration. Politically, Badajoz belongs to the [[Badajoz (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Spanish Congress Electoral District of Badajoz]], which is the largest electoral district about of 52 districts in the Spanish Congress of Deputies in terms of geographical area and includes a significant part of the Extremadura region. The electoral district was first contested in modern times in the 1977 General Election.{{sfn|Lúcia|1986|p=313}} At the time of the [[Extremaduran Assembly election, 2011|2011 election]], Badajoz had six deputies representing the district in congress, four from the People's Party-United Extremadura party (PP-EU), and two from the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elecciones.mir.es/resultadosgenerales2011/99CG/DCG10069CI_L1.htm|title=Badajoz|publisher=Elecciones.mir.es|access-date=12 July 2013|language=es|archive-date=February 23, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223015626/http://elecciones.mir.es/resultadosgenerales2011/99CG/DCG10069CI_L1.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

Historically, frequent wars ravaged Badajoz's economy and people were poor. Agricultural land was not fertile with no industry of any major importance in its territory. However, the historic monuments in the town and also in Mérida were major attractions to visitors, leading to the growth of tourism, and in recent years there has been some industrial development.{{Sfn|Ring|Salkin|La Boda|1995|p=74}}

Badajoz primarily is now a commercial city, ranked 25th place in economic importance in Spain according to Spain's Economic Yearbook for 2007, published by Servicio de Estudios de La Caixa.

===Cemeteries===
During the Visigoths period the burials, as noted from the archeological finds, were near the Picuriña, Pardaleras, and Cerro de Reyes sites. During the Arab period, burials were along the roads and near the eastern suburb of the Citadel, close to Cerro de la Muela and also in the area of Santiago bastion; these locations were noted during recent excavations. Badajocenses Christians from the earliest centuries towards the end of 19th century buried their dead in or near churches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aytobadajoz.es/es/ayto/cementerios/cementerios-gestionados/9735/cementerio-de-nuestra-senora-de-la-soledad|title=Cementerio de Nuestra-senora-de-la-Soledad|language=es|access-date=12 July 2013|publisher=Ayuntamiento de Badajoz|archive-date=April 5, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405000717/http://www.aytobadajoz.es/es/ayto/cementerios/cementerios-gestionados/9735/cementerio-de-nuestra-senora-de-la-soledad|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Culture and education==
While not a city renowned for its culture and art, many notable artists, musicians, and writers were born in the city. Hailing from the city in the arts are the actors [[Luis Alcoriza]], [[Manuel de Blas]], the writers [[Arturo Barea]], [[Vicente Barrantes Moreno]], [[José López Prudencio]], [[Emilio Morote Esquivel]], [[Jesús García Calderón]], the singers [[Antonio Hormigo]], [[Rosa Morena]], [[Federico Cabo]], [[Operación Triunfo (series 7)|Guadiana Almena]], [[La Caita]], [[Porrina de Badajoz]] and the pianists [[Cristóbal Oudrid]] and [[Esteban Sánchez]], and painters such as [[Luis de Morales]], [[Antonio Vaquero Poblador]], [[Felipe Checa]], [[Adelardo Covarsí Yustas]], and many others. The Institución Ferial de Badajoz (IFEBA), established in 2006, has not only become an important economic centre but has become a prominent regional cultural centre, and aside from trading it also regularly hosts cultural events from horse racing to break dancing to paintballing to Caribbean dancing.<ref name="PF"/> The principal theatre in Badajoz is the [[Teatro López de Ayala]], a grand white-painted theatre with arched windows with a capacity of 800 seats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aytobadajoz.es/es/ayto/monumentos/teatro-lopez-de-ayala|title=Teatro López de Ayala|publisher=Ayuntamiento de Badajoz|access-date=11 July 2013|language=es|archive-date=July 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130712125703/http://www.aytobadajoz.es/es/ayto/monumentos/teatro-lopez-de-ayala#.Ud6If20dRZE|url-status=live}}</ref> Performances of theatre, opera, concerts, and exhibitions are put on in the venue.

Like much of southern Spain, [[flamenco]] is very popular, and performances are regularly put on in Badajoz on the Plaza Alta and other venues. Some flamenco [[Palo (flamenco)|palos]] linked to Badajoz are [[:es:Jaleo (cante)|Extremaduran jaleos]] and Extremaduran [[Tango (flamenco)|tangos]].

[[Cristóbal Oudrid]] (1825–1877), one of the founding fathers of Spanish musical nationalism, was born in Badajoz, son of the resident military bandmaster. [[Rosa Morena]], a well-known flamenco-pop singer who was popular in the 1970s, was born in the city and still lives there; her most popular song is ''Échale guindas al pavo''.

The festival known as "Feria de San Juan" is held every year from 23 June to 1 July at this border town, which is a major attraction not only for people of Spain but also to the Portuguese who cross the border to attend the one-week festival. This festival also includes bull fights.{{Sfn|Kendrick|Michelson|Barbero|2008|p=196}}

Badajoz is influenced by its border with Portugal.  Portuguese restaurants and pastries can be found in the city, and residents often travel across the border for meals/excursions.

[[File:Badajoz Cathedral 2024 - West Façade.jpg|thumb|left|Façade of the [[Badajoz Cathedral]].]]
Badajoz is the [[Episcopal see|see]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mérida-Badajoz]]. Prior to the merger of the Diocese of Mérida and the Diocese of Badajoz, Badajoz was the see of the Diocese of Badajoz from the bishopric's inception in 1255.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=181}} Christianity thus became the dominant religion in Badajoz and the see of the Diocese of Badajoz is based here at the [[Badajoz Cathedral]] (Cathedral of St. John the Baptist), a [[gothic style]] building which was built in 1284 in the main plaza called the Plaza de España. It underwent extensive refurbishment during the 16th to 18th centuries. The paintings of Luis de Morales, a local artist of the [[Renaissance period]], are exhibited in the cathedral.{{Sfn|Ring|Salkin|La Boda|1995|p=74}} The tower of the cathedral, {{convert|41|m}} in height, was built in the gothic style in 1542 under architect [[Gaspar Méndez]]. Built with ashlar masonry, the windows are made of stone and carved. On two of its faces clocks were fixed during the renovations carried out in 1715. The tower has a belfry and is fortified with battlements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aytobadajoz.es/es/ayto/monumentos/torre-de-la-catedral|title=Torre de la Catedral|language=es|access-date=10 July 2013|publisher=Ayuntamiento de Badajoz|archive-date=July 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130712075504/http://www.aytobadajoz.es/es/ayto/monumentos/torre-de-la-catedral#.Ud256W22rLk|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1827, [[Richard Alfred Davenport]] wrote a gushing description of the dean of the cathedral of Badajoz, remarking that he was "more learned than all the doctors of Salamanca, Coimbra, and Alcala, united; he understood all languages, living and dead, and was perfect master of every science divine."{{sfn|Davenport|1827|p=108}}

Adoratrices is a small chapel dedicated to St. Joseph to commemorate the arrival of Christians along with King Alfonso IX of [[Kingdom of León|León]]. The Brotherhood of St. Joseph, founded in 1556, functioned from this chapel. During the 19th-century War of Independence the chapel was bombed and its importance declined during subsequent years. However, in 1917 it was refurbished in the neo-Gothic style and now the convent Madres Adoratrices Esclavas del Santísimo y de la Caridad functions from here.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aytobadajoz.es/es/ayto/monumentos/adoratrices|title=Adoratrices|language=es|access-date=10 July 2013|publisher=Ayuntamiento de Badajoz|archive-date=July 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130712030218/http://www.aytobadajoz.es/es/ayto/monumentos/adoratrices#.Ud25Lm22rLk|url-status=live}}</ref>
