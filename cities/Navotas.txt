'''Navotas''', officially the '''City of Navotas''' ({{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Navotas}}), is a [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|highly urbanized city]] in the [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]] of the [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 247,543 people.{{PH census|current}}

It was formerly part of the [[Rizal (province)|Province of Rizal]] in southern Luzon. It comprises what is known as the [[Administrative divisions of Metro Manila#Districts|CAMANAVA]] area along with the cities of [[Caloocan]], [[Malabon]], and [[Valenzuela, Metro Manila|Valenzuela]].

It is known as the ''Commercial Fishing Hub of the Philippines'', for the city has the third largest fish port in Asia and the largest in [[Southeast Asia]]. Although it was established on February 16, 1859, Navotas celebrates its foundation day every January 16, the day in 1906 when it finally separated from [[Malabon]]. Navotas became a highly urbanized city on June 24, 2007.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Navotas Becomes Metro Manila's Newest City |work=Inquirer.net |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/metro/view_article.php?article_id=73120 |access-date=June 24, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628054453/https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/metro/view_article.php?article_id=73120 |archive-date=June 28, 2007}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Navotas was once part of [[Malabon]]. According to one legend, the long and narrow delta extended unbroken from north to south along the seashore. The strip of land between the former district of [[Tondo, Manila]] and this town was eaten away by the sea until an opening was made. Water began to flow through the opening. The geographical change prompted the people to refer to the place as "''butas''", "''nayon ng butas''", or "''nabutas''", a [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word that means breached or pierced through.<ref name="RizalProvinceDirectory1934">{{Cite book |last=Salonga |first=Isayas |url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/philamer/aar6353.0001.001 |title=Rizal Province directory |publisher=[[University of Michigan]] Digital Collections |year=1934 |volume=1 |location=[[Manila]]|accessdate=April 17, 2024}}</ref>{{rp|page=[https://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/philamer/aar6353.0001.001/107?rgn=full+text&view=image 99]}} What began as a natural channel developed into a regular waterway, now known as the Navotas River. In later years, the place came to be known as "Nabotas", then "Navotas".<ref name="history" />

It was also known as Hacienda de Navotas. It was once owned by the Dominican friars until it was sold to the Pascual family during the early days of the American regime and developed into a residential estate.

San Jose de Navotas was the name given to the locality after its patron saint, [[Saint Joseph]]. On June 11, 1859, a "''Superior Decreto''" established a new parish and municipality under the supervision of Friar Matias Navoa. The populace was divided into two distinct groups, the ''naturales'' (locals) and the ''[[mestizo]]s''. Mariano Estrellas was the ''gobernadorcillo'' (petty governor) of the ''naturales'' and Mariano Israel, of the ''mestizos''. Today, because records are incomplete, recognition is only given to the ''gobernadorcillos'' for the ''mestizos''. A school in honor of San Jose was built and known as "San Jose Academy."

{{Quote box
 | quoted = true
 | quote  = All that I have above related having taken place, it was decided to make peace with the nearest villages, some of whom had come to beg it from the governor, and others would not. Among those who would not come was a village called ''Butas'', situated on an inlet on the other side of the river flowing past Manilla, and about a league and a half away. This village, uniting with the others near by, sent word that they did not wish peace or friendship with the governor; and had the boldness to come as far as the village of Alcandora [ie [[Lakandula]]], quite close to Manilla, whence they sent defiance to the governor and the captains.

===Spanish colonial era===
The movement for the separation of barrios San Jose de Navotas and Bangkulasi from [[Malabon|Tambobong]] (now Malabon), then a town in the [[Manila (province)|province of Tondo]] (later Manila), began on December 20, 1827. Led by the ''[[Principalía|principales]]'' of such barrios, such separation was petitioned before the Spanish colonial government when the locals experienced difficulties in doing business transactions and accessing Tambobong's ''[[poblacion]]'' across what is now the Navotas River for religious events. 

On February 16, 1859, the petition was finally granted, separating both barrios from Tambobong to form a new distinct town.<ref name="RizalProvinceDirectory1934" /> The town initially composed of four ''barrio''s (villages): San Jose, Tangos, Bangkulasi, and Tanza. Later on June 11, the Real Audiencia enacted a ''Superior Decreto'', which established the San Jose de Navotas Parish with a church and parochial school.

On August 6, 1898, Navotas joined the revolutionary government of General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]].<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=https://www.navotas.gov.ph/OurCity/History|title=Our History|website=Navotas City|accessdate=August 1, 2023}}</ref>

==Geography==

===Topography===
Navotas is a coastal town in the northwest part of Metro Manila. It is a narrow strip of land with an aggregated shoreline of approximately {{convert|4.5|km|sp=us}}. It is bordered on the north by [[Obando, Bulacan|Obando]], [[Bulacan]] along Sukol Creek which separates it from [[Isla Pulo|Balt]]; on the south by the city of [[Manila]]; on the east by the cities of [[Malabon]] and [[Caloocan]] and bodies of water such as Binuangan River, the Daang Cawayan River, the Dampalit River, the Batasan River, the Navotas River, the Bangculasi Channel, the Malabon Channel and the Estero de Maypajo; and on the west by [[Manila Bay]]. Islands encompassed by the city include [[Navotas Island]], where the city proper is located, and [[Isla Pulo]]. 

Land reclamation, which includes the Navotas Fish Port Complex, had increased the city's land area. Projects such as the [[Navotas Boulevard Business Park]] and the Navotas Fish Port Complex expansion by the Philippine Fisheries Development Authority are expected to add up to {{convert|680|ha}} to the city's land area.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/business/2024/2/28/2-manila-bay-reclamation-projects-expected-to-resume-soon-2057|title=2 Manila Bay reclamation projects expected to resume soon|first=Andrea|last=Taguines|date=February 28, 2024|accessdate=May 14, 2024|work=ABS-CBN News}}</ref>

'''Population Changes'''

Some barangays in Navotas experienced dramatic population change between 2010 and 2020. This is because of an ongoing effort by the government to relocate informal settlers from hazard-prone areas to socialized housing built in Barangay Tanza 2.

Its name is derived from San Roque de Navotas Parish, the first place of worship in the town.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

It is famous for its annual [[Festival|fiesta]], every last Saturday and Sunday of the month of January. Every fiesta the whole barangay (including Brgy's Tangos North and Tangos South) is filled with stalls and stores. Also every fiesta of San Roque, A.

===Political profile===
{{one source section|date=June 2019}}
With regards to the separation of Navotas from Malabon in 1859 and the organization thereof as a distinct municipality or "pueblo" with its own government and church, this town was headed by the
gobernadorcillos who exercised executive and judicial functions.
However, as this locality was composed of two groups the naturales and the mestizos, each of which had its own gobernadorcillo appointed by the governor-general who was the supreme authority in all local matters, since the inhabitants did not allow choosing their officials. This political system was somehow revoked at the end of the Spanish Regime through the Maura Law of 1883, which guided some of the selected officials to the supervision of an insular authority. During the revolutionary period (from 1898 to 1902), as the democratic system of local governance was being established via the First Philippines Republic and Malolos Constitution, people of Navotas with high character, social position and honorable conduct gathered in a meeting and elected the chief of the town, the
headman of the barrio (barangay) and three officials viz., for police and internal order, justice and civil registry, and taxes and property. In this situation, these elected officials constitute an assembly wherein the chief of the
town was the president, the headman, the vice-president, and the justice officer the secretary. In this period, the name of Navotas LGU and its head were changed from "pueblo to municipality" and from "President to Mayor". Philippine Commission, which exercised supervision over local government, appointed the first local
official. Gradually, election of officials was allowed.

During the period of the Philippine Commonwealth (from 1935 to 1945), the 1935 constitution ushered.
This provided that the President of the Philippines should exercise general supervision over all local
governments. This allowed Navotas to have three leaders. This trend from 1946 to 1972 (during the second Philippine Republic) was toward decentralization. Congress passed laws giving more autonomy to Local Government Units through the grant of additional powers and lessening of national control affairs. This created four Mayors of Navotas. During the Martial Law Period, President Marcos had changed the structure and functions of LGU's, thus
decentralization suffered the set back with the concentration of power on his hands. After December 31, 1975 (expiration of tenure of office of the local elective officials), the President assumed the power of appointment of
the officials as authorized by the people in a referendum held on February 27, 1975. During the Marcos Regime, Navotas had two Mayors.

Navotas was proclaimed as a full-fledged city by virtue of RA 9387<ref>{{cite web|title=Republic Act No. 9387: An Act Conventing the Municipality of Navotas into a Highly Urbanized City to be Known as the City of Navotas|url=http://www.thecorpusjuris.com/legislative/republic-acts/ra-no-9387.php|website=The Corpus Juris|date=March 10, 2007 |access-date=March 9, 2016}}</ref> that converted the municipality of Navotas into a highly urbanized city. A plebiscite was held on June 24, 2007, which was ratified the conversion of Navotas into a highly urbanized city.
