Its name literally means "pearl sea", which originates from the city's location at the [[river mouth|mouth]] of the Pearl River meeting the [[South China Sea]]. Zhuhai borders [[Jiangmen]] to the west, [[Zhongshan]] to the north and [[Macau]] to the southeast, and shares [[maritime boundaries]] with [[Shenzhen]] and Hong Kong to the northeast across the estuary.

Zhuhai was one of the original four [[Special Economic Zones of China|Special Economic Zones]] established in 1980, as well as one of China's premier tourist destinations, being called the [[Chinese Riviera]]. While the city is located in the traditionally [[Cantonese]]-speaking province of Guangdong, a significant portion of the population is now made up of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaking economic migrants originally from inland provinces.

The core of Zhuhai, [[Xiangzhou District, Zhuhai|Xiangzhou District]] along with [[Macao]], in the northeastern portion of the administrative division, are part of the [[Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area]], the biggest built-up area in the world with more than 65,565,622 inhabitants as of the 2020 census, encompassing Shenzhen, Dongguan, Foshan, Zhongshan, Macau, the main part of Guangzhou, and small parts of Jiangmen and Huizhou cities but with Hong Kong not quite conurbated yet.

According to a report released in 2014 by the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]], Zhuhai is the most liveable city in China.<ref>{{Cite news |date=9 May 2014 |title=Shè kē yuàn: Zhūhǎi qǔdài xiānggǎng chéngwéi zuì yí jū chéngshì |script-title=zh:社科院：珠海取代香港成为最宜居城市 |language=zh |work=[[163.com]] news |url=http://news.163.com/14/0509/15/9RQHTIPB00014JB5.html |url-status=dead |access-date=12 September 2014 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304131703/http://news.163.com/14/0509/15/9RQHTIPB00014JB5.html }}</ref> Zhuhai is classified as a Medium-Port Metropolis.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/03088839.2020.1802785 |title=The Southampton system: A new universal standard approach for port-city classification |year=2021 |last1=Roberts |first1=Toby |last2=Williams |first2=Ian |last3=Preston |first3=John |journal=Maritime Policy & Management |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=530–542 |s2cid=225502755 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

== History ==
Zhuhai has had a long history in the development of the exhibition industry in China. Zhuhai was the first permanent motor racing facility in China and has become a centre for the local racing scene, as well as a semi-regular fixture on the international racing circuit, including the [[Zhuhai Special Economic Zone]].

== Population ==
The population of Zhuhai has experienced steady growth from 2014 to 2023. In 2014, the city’s population was approximately 1.51 million, which increased to about 2.49 million by the end of 2023.

=== Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge ===
This bridge was first proposed by [[Gordon Wu]] and contemplated by [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], municipal governments in the [[Pearl River Delta]], the provincial government of [[Guangdong]], and the central government of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Before the government handover of Hong Kong, the [[British government]] also considered plans for a bridge. After 1997 the commercial interests of Hong Kong prompted the local government to consider the plans as well.<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Anthony G. O. Yeh |title=Developing a Competitive Pearl River Delta in South China Under One Country two Systems |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |year=2006 |page=407 |isbn=9789622097674 }}</ref>

On 24 October 2018 the [[Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge]] (HZMB) was opened.

== Geography ==

Zhuhai borders the [[Macau]] [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Region]] (north and west),<ref name=":132">{{Cite book |last=Simpson |first=Tim |title=Betting on Macau: Casino Capitalism and China's Consumer Revolution |date=2023 |publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]] |isbn=978-1-5179-0031-1 |series=Globalization and Community series |location=Minneapolis }}</ref>{{Rp|page=113}} and is {{convert|140|km|0|abbr=off}} southwest of [[Guangzhou]]. Its territory has {{convert|690|km|0|abbr=off}} of coastline and 217 islands, of which 147 are over 500 square metres in area.<ref name="isl">{{Cite web |title=Overview of Zhuhai |url=http://www.cityofzhuhai.com/2019-02/20/c_270301.htm |url-status=dead |website=cityofzhuhai.com |language=en |access-date=30 September 2019 |archive-date=30 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190930105440/http://www.cityofzhuhai.com/2019-02/20/c_270301.htm }}</ref>

The islands within the prefecture-level city of Zhuhai include a number of near-shore islands, often connected to the mainland by bridges or causeways (such as [[Hengqin]], [[Qi'ao]], or [[Yelidao|Yeli]] Islands), as well as some islands in the open [[South China Sea]] (the [[Wanshan Archipelago]]). Some of the latter are actually geographically closer to Hong Kong than to the Zhuhai mainland. The jurisdiction of [[Nei Lingding Island]], located in the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] [[estuary]] was transferred from Zhuhai to Shenzhen in 2009.<ref>{{Cite news |date=26 September 2009 |title=Nèi língdīng dǎo guīshǔ shēnzhèn shì guǎnxiá |script-title=zh:内伶仃岛归属深圳市管辖 |language=zh-hans |work=sznews.com |url=http://news.sznews.com/content/2009-09/26/content_4081368_2.htm |url-status=dead |access-date=1 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929100348/http://news.sznews.com/content/2009-09/26/content_4081368_2.htm |archive-date=29 September 2009 }}</ref>

==Climate==
Despite being located within the tropics, Zhuhai has a [[humid subtropical climate]] affected by the East Asian Monsoon (Koppen classification Cwa) and moderated by the South China Sea, with long, hot and humid summers with frequent thunderstorms, and short, mild and dry winters. Average highs in January and July are {{convert|18|and|32|C|F|0}} respectively. Snowfalls are unknown and a frost has never been recorded in the city centre. Conversely, extreme heat waves do not occur as they do further inland. Being named one of the most liveable cities in China, real estate is robust here. Residents from the mainland, especially those from the North, will buy homes and spend their winters in Zhuhai.

== Economy ==

In 1980 the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) announced that the city of Zhuhai would be one of four special economic zones. Those doing business in the SEZ are eligible for a range of incentives provided by the PRC.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Michael Casey |title=The Unfair Trade: How Our Broken Global Financial System Destroys the Middle Class |publisher=Crown |year=2012 |page=102 |isbn=9780307885326 }}</ref> Zhuhai became a city in 1979, a year before it was designated as one of the first [[Special economic zones of China|Special Economic Zone]]s of China (SEZ). Similarly to neighbouring [[Shenzhen]], which became the first Special Economic Zone of China in 1978, the implementation of Zhuhai as an SEZ was largely due to its strategic position adjacent to Macau, a capitalist trading center similar to Shenzhen's position with Hong Kong.

The establishment of Zhuhai as an SEZ allowed the Chinese Central Government and economy to have easier access to the Macau and consequently, global market. As a result, Zhuhai is now a major city in the Pearl River Delta region according to the new general urban plan approved by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]. The implementation of Special Economy Zone intended for the city to become a key port city, science and education city, scenic and tourism city, and as a regional hub for transportation.

The outstanding geographic location, a wide range of supporting infrastructure and a deep-water port serve as a major attraction for foreign capital. Utilized foreign investment reached US$10.344 billion in 2008. Among the top 500 enterprises worldwide, 19 of them have investment projects in Zhuhai such as [[ExxonMobil]], [[BP]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[Carrefour]] and [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]].

=== Manufacturing industries ===
[[File:The Group of Meizu.jpg|thumb|[[Meizu]]]]

Industrial development in Zhuhai focuses on five new high-tech and heavy industries including [[electronics]], computer software, [[biotechnology]] and [[pharmacy]], machinery and equipment as well as [[petrochemical]] industries. Aiming to strengthen the existing industrial base as well as to provide a better environment for the development of new high-tech industries, the local government has taken the initiative in developing five economic zones:

==== Zhuhai High-Tech Industrial Development Zone ====
As one of the four earliest Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in China, Zhuhai SEZ was set up in the year 1980 and granted with a local legislative right. Zhuhai hi-tech zone is located in the north of Zhuhai, which is very close to downtown. Furthermore, technological resources are centralised in our zone; there is also a huge development in hi-tech industries led by the software and IC industries. The hi-tech zone is the showcase for Zhuhai's scientific development.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Zhuhai High-Tech Industrial Zone |url=http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/zhuhai-national-hi-tech-development-zone/ |url-status=dead |access-date=23 June 2021 |website=RightSite.asia |language=en |archive-date=23 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210623072653/https://www.google.com/adsense/domains/caf.js }}</ref> [[Meizu]] is one high tech product headquartered in Zhuhai.

==== Zhuhai Free Trade Zone ====
Zhuhai Free Trade Zone (Zhuhai FTZ) was founded in 1996 with the State Council's approval, occupying {{cvt|3|km2}}. A Zhuhai FTZ Administrative Committee was set up in June 1997. By the end of 2006 there had been over 200 companies registered in the Free Trade Zone, including more than 150 foreign-funded enterprises, and the total investment amount was one billion US dollars.Industries encouraged in the zone include electronics assembly and manufacturing, telecommunications equipment, building/construction materials, instruments and industrial equipment production, medical equipment and supplies, raw material processing, [[research and development]], shipping/warehousing/logistics, and heavy industry.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Zhuhai Free Trade Zone |url=http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/zhuhai-free-trade-zone/ |publisher=RightSite.asia |language=en }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Zhūhǎi bǎoshuìqū, zhū ào kuà jìng gōngyè qū |script-title=zh:珠海保税区、珠澳跨境工业区 |url=http://www.cfea.org.cn/bs/zh.asp |url-status=dead |website=Zhōngguó bǎoshuìqū chūkǒu jiāgōng qū xiéhu |language=zh |access-date=22 March 2013 |archive-date=27 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027101215/http://www.cfea.org.cn/bs/zh.asp }}</ref>

==== Wanshan ocean development testing zone ====
The Wanshan archipelago is located in one of the major fishing areas of China and is core to the Wanshan ocean development testing zone. However, ''[[Perna viridis]]'', a species of green mussel, was found to be contaminated by HCHs, DDTs, and PCBs.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Huang |first1=Shao-hui 黄少辉 |last2=Wang |first2=Wei-chen 王伟臣 |date=2000 |title=Zhūhǎi wàn shān qúndǎo hǎishàng shēngtài gōngyuán jiànshè guīhuà gòuxiǎng |script-title=zh:珠海万山群岛海上生态公园建设规划构想 |trans-title=A Conception of Constructing the Marine Ecological Park in Wanshan Islands, Zhuhai |url=http://www.rddl.com.cn/CN/Y2000/V20/I3/228 |journal=Rèdài dìlǐ / Tropical Geography |language=zh |volume=20 |issue=13 |pages=228–232 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Fang |first1=Zhanqiang 方展强 |last2=Zhang |first2=Runxing 张润兴 |last3=Huang |first3=Minghong 黄铭洪 |date=2001 |title=Zhūjiāng hékǒu qū fěicuì yí bèi zhōng yǒujī lǜ nóngyào hé duō lǜ lián běn hánliàng jí fēnbù |journal=Huánjìng kēxué xuébào |language=zh |issue=1 |doi=10.13671/j.hjkxxb.2001.01.022 |trans-journal=Acta Scientiae Circumstantiae }}</ref>

==== Hengqin economic development zone ====
In April 2023 the [[National Development and Reform Commission]] (NDRC) has published for the Hengqin economic development zone a list of industries that are illegible for investment policies, including [[income tax]] benefits for workers. The stated aim of the investment policy is to integrate [[Macao]] with key industries in the [[Pearl River Delta]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hengqin Cooperation Zone Releases Catalogue of Industries Encouraged for Investment |date=12 April 2023 |author1=Arendse Huld |url=https://www.china-briefing.com/news/hengqin-new-area-encouraged-industries-catalogue/ |publisher=China Briefing |language=en }}</ref>

==== Global printer consumables manufacturing centre ====
Zhuhai manufactured and supplied 70 per cent of the world's ribbons, 60 per cent of the world's aftermarket [[inkjet cartridge]]s and 20 per cent of the world's third-party laser toner cartridges. Their combined sales were worth more than 1.3 billion US dollars or 10 per cent of all the sales in the world. Zhuhai owns a comprehensive supply chain and almost any of the raw materials needed by the printer consumables industry can be provided locally.

== Administration ==

The [[prefecture-level city]] of Zhuhai administers three [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#County level|county-level divisions]] and four special economic districts, all of which are [[District of China|districts]].

Its place inside Jiuzhou inner district, permits quick transport of injured people from surrounding islands to the city hospitals. China Southern Airlines offer sightseeing flights and charters to drilling stations in South China Sea using [[Sikorsky S-76]] helicopters via this airport as well. They used to fly to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport from this airport using [[Cessna 208 Caravan|Cessna C208 Caravan]] as well, but the route was discontinued.
Zhuhai also is served by airports outside:
* [[Macau International Airport]] {{airport codes|MFM|VMMC}}, which is closer to the city of Zhuhai proper, than Zhuhai Jinwan Airport itself, has an "Express Link" service in which transiting passengers who go through [[Gongbei Port of Entry]]/[[Posto Fronteiriço das Portas do Cerco]] are not processed through Macau customs; passengers may also have their baggage taken from Macau Airport to [[Lótus Bridge|Lotus Bridge]] in [[Hengqin Island]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Express Link Service |url=https://www.macau-airport.com/en/transportation/express-link-service |access-date=9 May 2018 |website=Macau International Airport |language=en}} – "Land to Air" discusses procedures for Gongbei, and at "Air to Sea": "Our professional team will deliver your baggage directly to the Macau Maritime Ferry Terminal/Pac On Pier, or Hengqin Border at Mainland." refers to Lotus Bridge which is at Hengqin.</ref>

=== Railway ===

[[Zhuhai Railway Station]] is located at the western end of [[Gongbei Port of Entry]] and [[Portas do Cerco]] at the border of Zhuhai and Macau. There are frequent [[China Railway High-speed|high speed]] trains to Guangzhou, Guilin, Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu and other main cities in China. The intercity railway between Zhuhai Gongbei and Zhuhai Jinwan International Airport is under construction. It is expected to be opened to Hengqin in November 2019, and the whole project will be completed in 2024. It will take only 30 minutes to commute from urban district to the airport using the completed line.

Zhuhai also has a [[Trams in Zhuhai|tram network]], with the first phase of Line 1 completed in 2014. In 2017, Line 1 began service to the public. The trams ceased running in January 2021 due to frequent power issues and low patronage.

The Zhuhai Metro ({{zh|labels=no|s=珠海地铁}}) is currently in the planning stage. Line 1 will start from Jiuzhou Port and end at the Jinwan Station, with a total length of 36.8&nbsp;km; Line 2 will start from Jinding Industrial Area and end at Gongbei Port, with a total length of 30.5&nbsp;km. Construction was expected to start in 2019, with an estimated time of completion in 2024.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

=== Sea ===

Zhuhai is known for its good climate and good air quality. Endowed with a long coastline, it is the only city on the western Pearl River Delta with natural deep-water ports.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

Zhuhai has two international [[seaport]]s: [[Jiuzhou Port|Jiuzhou]] ({{zh|labels=no|c=九洲港}}) and Gaolan ({{zh|labels=no|s=高栏港}}). Gaolan Port is one of the leading ports in Guangdong province, while [[Jiuzhou Port]] focuses on heavy passenger sea transport.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

[[Chu Kong Passenger Transport Co., Ltd|Chu Kong Passenger Transport]] operates a ferry service between Zhuhai's Jiuzhou Port, Hong Kong and [[Shekou Passenger Terminal]], in the [[Nanshan District, Shenzhen|Nanshan District]] of Shenzhen. A service between Jiuzhou Port and [[Hong Kong International Airport]] for air passengers using the airport began on 10 July 2007.<ref>{{Cite news |date=10 July 2007 |title=New HK-Zhuhai Ferry Service Starts |language=en |work=news.gov.hk |url=http://www.news.gov.hk/en/category/infrastructureandlogistics/070710/html/070710en06002.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812192440/http://www.news.gov.hk/en/category/infrastructureandlogistics/070710/html/070710en06002.htm |archive-date=12 August 2007 }}</ref>

=== Road ===

Zhuhai is currently served by two major [[Expressways of China|Chinese national expressways]]:
[[File:China_Expwy_G94_sign_with_name.svg|25px]] [[G94 Pearl River Delta Ring Expressway]]

* The G94 Pearl River Delta Ring Expressway, which will form a beltway surrounding the Guangzhou [[Pearl River Delta|metropolitan area]] when completed, currently connects Zhuhai to the [[Sanshui District]] of [[Foshan]]. In 2018 the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge opened, reducing the travel time by road from Zhuhai to Hong Kong in approximately 40 minutes. G94 was extended to follow this bridge, with sections currently under construction connecting the bridge to the Zhuhai-Foshan section.

[[File:China_Expwy_G0425_sign_with_name.svg|25px]] [[G0425 Guangzhou–Macau Expressway]]
* A spur route of the mainline [[G4 Beijing–Hong Kong and Macau Expressway]], G0425 directly links Guangzhou to Zhuhai (and thus, Macau). It has a concurrency with G94 for several kilometres. Heavy traffic between Zhuhai and Macau has led to the construction of a new cross-border corridor, the [[Lótus Bridge|Lotus Bridge]], built in November 1999 to divert traffic away from the congested [[Gongbei Port of Entry]] ([[Portas do Cerco]]). G0425 currently ends in Zhuhai at Zhuhai Avenue, pending an extension to the Lotus Bridge via [[Hengqin]] island.

== Tourism ==
[[File:Zhuhai-fishing-port-0693.jpg|thumb|right|Xiangzhou fishing harbour, with the forested Yeli Island in the horizon]]
Zhuhai and the surrounding landscapes were developed into an industrial output zone in the 1980s. Prior to that, Zhuhai generated economic development on the basis of tourism, benefiting from the comfortable subtropical climate. Zhuhai enjoys the reputation of a coastal garden city. When environmental pollution from the manufacturing industries threatened the quality of life, Zhuhai introduced strict environmental laws and hired engineers from Singapore to assist the city with [[urban planning]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Jerry Patchell |title=China's Greater Bay Area: Agglomeration, External Economies, Governance and Urbanization |publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=2023 |page= |isbn=9781000920079 }}</ref>

[[File:Remote view of Jintai Temple dllu.jpg|thumb|[[Jintai Temple]] in [[Doumen, Zhuhai|Doumen]], a tourist attraction rebuilt in the 1990s on the site of a historical temple complex.]]
Realizing the benefits brought by tourism, the local government is expanding tourist destinations and is developing new spots such as [[Hengqin]] ({{zh|labels=no|s=横琴岛}}), Dong'ao ({{zh|labels=no|s=东澳}}), [[Hebao Island|Hebao]] ({{zh|labels=no|c=荷包}}), Qi'ao ({{zh|labels=no|s=淇澳岛}}) and Yeli ({{zh|labels=no|c=野狸}}).

== Exhibitions and conferences ==
Zhuhai hosts the [[China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition]] biannually in November. It is the largest Air Show in China and a huge tourist attraction.

=== New Yuan Ming Palace ===

The New Yuan Ming Palace ({{zh|first=s|s=圆明新园|t=圓明新園}}) is a park of {{convert|1.39|km²|2|abbr=off}}, including an {{cvt|80000|m²|0}} lake.

== Education ==

=== Colleges and universities ===

* [[Beijing Normal University at Zhuhai|Beijing Normal University Zhuhai Campus]]
* [[Sun Yat-Sen University]] Zhuhai Campus
* [[Jinan University]] Zhuhai Campus
* [[Zunyi Medical University]] Zhuhai Campus

=== Primary and secondary education ===

Despite the shortage of higher education, Zhuhai government has been paying a lot of attention to primary and secondary education. From 2007, high school students in Zhuhai needn't pay school fees any more.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Han |first=Xiaotong 韩晓彤 |date=9 May 2017 |title=Zhūhǎi "gāozhōng miǎnfèi jiàoyù" shí nián: Bǔtiē 6.5 Yì,55 wàn réncì shòu huì |script-title=zh:珠海“高中免费教育”十年：补贴6.5亿，55万人次受惠 |work=thepaper.cn |url=https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_1680969 |language=zh }}</ref>

As a result, there are many famous high schools in Zhuhai. [[Zhuhai No.1 High School]] (ZH1Z) is one of the most competitive high schools in Guangdong Province, and also a member of the Guangdong "Six Schools Union".
