==History==
The towns of Hiraiso and Minato, as well as the village of Katsuta, were created within [[Naka District, Ibaraki|Naka District]] with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Minato was renamed Nakaminato in 1938. Nakaminato had the commercial fishing industry as its main industry, but the area rapidly developed into a [[company town]] of [[Hitachi]], Katsuta was elevated to town status in 1940. During [[World War II]], the area was subject to air raids and shelling by Allied warships due to its numerous factories producing war-related materials.  On March 31, 1954, the towns of Nakaminato and Hiraiso merged, forming the city of Nakaminato. Katsuta was raised to city status on November 1 of the same year.
