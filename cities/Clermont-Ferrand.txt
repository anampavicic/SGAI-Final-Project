[[Olivier Bianchi]] is its current [[List of mayors of Clermont-Ferrand|mayor]].

Clermont-Ferrand sits on the plain of [[Limagne]] in the [[Massif Central]] and is surrounded by a major industrial area. The city is known for the chain of [[volcano]]es, the [[Chaîne des Puys]], which surround it. This includes the dormant volcano [[Puy de Dôme]], 10 kilometres (6 miles) away, one of the highest in the surrounding area, which is topped by communications towers and visible from the city. Clermont-Ferrand has been listed as a "tectonic hotspot" since July 2018 on the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]].

One of the oldest French cities, it was known by [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] as the capital of the [[Arverni]]e tribe before developing in the [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] era under the name of Augustonemetum in the 1st century BC. The forum of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] city was located on the top of the Clermont mound, on the site of the present [[Clermont-Ferrand Cathedral|cathedral.]] During the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|decline of the Western Roman Empire]] it was subjected to repeated looting by the peoples who invaded [[Gaul]], including [[Vandals]], [[Alans]], [[Visigoths]] and [[Franks]]. It was later raided by [[Vikings]] as the [[Carolingian Empire]] weakened in the [[early Middle Ages]]. Growing in importance under the [[Capetian dynasty]], in 1095 it hosted the [[Council of Clermont]], where [[Pope Urban II]] called the [[First Crusade]]. In 1551, Clermont became a royal town, and was declared an inseparable property of the [[French monarchy|Crown]] in 1610.

Today Clermont-Ferrand hosts the [[Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival]] ({{lang|fr|Festival du Court-Métrage de Clermont-Ferrand}}), one of the world's leading festivals for [[short films]]. It is also home to the corporate headquarters of [[Michelin]], the global tyre company founded in the city more than 100 years ago. With a quarter of the municipal population being students, and some 6,000 researchers, Clermont-Ferrand is the first city in France to join the [[UNESCO]] Learning City Network.

Along with its highly distinctive black lava stone [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] styled [[Clermont-Ferrand Cathedral|Cathedral]], Clermont-Ferrand's other famous sites include the [[public square]] [[Place de Jaude]], in which stands a grand statue of [[Vercingetorix]] astride a warhorse and brandishing a sword. The inscription reads {{langx|fr|label=in French|J'ai pris les armes pour la liberté de tous||I took up arms for the liberty of all}}). This statue was sculpted by [[Frédéric Bartholdi]], who also created the [[Statue of Liberty]].

[[File:Clermont-Ferrand - Mur des Sarrasins 20220528-01.jpg|thumb|left|Only remaining Gallo-Roman wall of the Vasso Galate temple, Clermont-Ferrand.]]
Clermont-Ferrand's first name was ''Augusto[[nemeton|nemetum]]'', Latin for "[[sanctuary]] for [[Augustus]]", or ''Civitas Arvernorum'' (town of the Arverni people).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.augustonemetum.fr/News/Info-74/La-fondation.html |website=augustonemetum.fr |language=French |access-date=12 July 2023 |first=Hélène |last=Dartevelle  |title=La fondation |date=2023 |quote=Traditionnellement, la ville aurait été créée lors de la fondation de la voie d'Agrippa Lyon/Saintes reliant la capitale des Gaules (Lyon) à Saintes, capitale de l'Aquitaine. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230604095206/http://www.augustonemetum.fr/News/Info-74/La-fondation.html |archive-date=4 June 2023}}</ref> It originated on the central knoll where the cathedral is situated today, overlooking the capital of Gaulish Arvernis ([[w:fr:Arvernis|fr]]). The fortified castle of Clarus Mons gave its name to the whole town in 848, to which the small episcopal town of [[Montferrand (district of Clermont-Ferrand)|Montferrand]] was attached in 1731, together taking the name of Clermont-Ferrand. The amalgamation of the two towns was decreed by [[Louis XIII]] and confirmed by [[Louis XV]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clermont-ferrand.fr/History.html |title=History – Ville de Clermont-Ferrand |language=fr |publisher=Clermont-ferrand.fr |access-date=12 March 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120723063002/http://www.clermont-ferrand.fr/History.html |archive-date=23 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The old part of Clermont is delimited by the route of the ramparts as they existed at the end of the Middle Ages.

===Prehistory and Roman era===
[[File:Inauguration statue vercingétorix 3.JPG|left|thumb|Statue of [[Vercingétorix]] by [[Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi]] on the main square of the city]]
Clermont ranks among the [[List of cities by time of continuous habitation|oldest cities]] of France. The first known mention was by the Greek geographer [[Strabo]], who called it the "metropolis of the [[Arverni]]" (meaning their ''[[oppidum]] [[civitas]]'' or tribal capital). The city was at that time called ''Nemessos'' – a [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] word for a sacred forest, and was situated on the mound where the cathedral of Clermont-Ferrand stands today. Somewhere in the area around Nemossos, the Arverni chieftain [[Vercingetorix]] (later to head a unified Gallic resistance to the [[Gallic Wars|Roman invasion]] led by [[Julius Caesar]]) was born around 72 BC. Nemossos was situated not far from the [[Gergovie plateau|plateau of Gergovia]], where Vercingetorix repulsed the Roman assault at the [[Battle of Gergovia]] in 52 BC. After the Roman conquest, the city became known as ''Augustonemetum''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0006:entry=augustonemetum|title=Augustonemetum|publisher=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites|access-date=27 October 2024}}</ref>

===Early Middle Ages===
The city became the seat of a bishop in the 5th century, at the time of the bishop [[Namatius]], who built a cathedral here described by [[Gregory of Tours]]. Clermont went through a dark period after the disappearance of the [[Roman Empire]] and during the [[High Middle Ages]] was pillaged by the peoples who invaded Gaul. Between 471 and 475, [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] was often the target of [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] expansion, and the city was frequently besieged, including once by [[Euric]]. Although defended by [[Sidonius Apollinaris]], at the head of the diocese from 468 to 486, and the [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] [[Ecdicius]], the city was ceded to the Visigoths by emperor [[Julius Nepos]] in 475 and remained part of the Visigothic kingdom until 507. A generation later, it became part of the [[Kingdom of the Franks]]. On 8 November 535 the [[Council of Clermont (535)|first Council of Clermont]] opened at Arvernis (Clermont), with fifteen bishops participating, including [[Caesarius of Arles]], [[Nicetius|Nizier of Lyons]], the Bishop of [[Archbishopric of Trier|Trier]], and [[Hilary of Arles|Saint Hilarius]], Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mende|Mende]]. The Council issued 16 decrees. The second canon reiterated the principle that the granting of episcopal dignity must be made according to merit and not as a result of intrigues.

In 570, Bishop Avitus ordered the [[Jews]] of the city, who numbered over 500, to accept Christian baptism or be expelled.<ref>{{cite book |title= Encyclopaedia Judaica |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]}} as quoted by {{cite web | url = http://www.geschichteinchronologie.ch/eu/F/EncJud_juden-in-Frankreich01-Rom-u-karolinger-ENGL.html| title = Encyclopaedia Judaica: Jews in France 01: Roman times and Carolingians| first = Michael
| last = Palomino| work=History in Chronology
| publisher=geschichteinchronologie.ch}}</ref>

In 848, the city was renamed ''Clairmont'', after the castle Clarus Mons. During this era, it was an episcopal city ruled by its bishop. Clermont was not spared by the Vikings at the time of the weakening of the [[Carolingian Empire]]: it was ravaged by the Normans under [[Hastein]] in 862 and 864 and, while its bishop Sigon carried out reconstruction work, again in 898 (or 910, according to some sources). Bishop [[Pope Stephen II|Étienne II]] built a new Romanesque cathedral which was consecrated in 946. It was almost entirely replaced by the current Gothic cathedral, though the crypt survives and the towers were only replaced in the 19th century.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Galeries de jaude 11072006.jpg|thumb|Galeries of Jaude]]
Clermont was the starting point of the [[First Crusade]], in which [[Christendom]] sought to retake Muslim-ruled [[Jerusalem]]. [[Pope Urban II]] called for the crusade in 1095 at the [[Council of Clermont|Second Council of Clermont]]. In 1120, following repeated crises between the counts of [[County of Auvergne|Auvergne]] and the bishops of [[Bishopric of Clermont|Clermont]] and in order to counteract the clergy's power, the counts founded the rival city of Montferrand on a mound next to the fortifications of Clermont, on the model of the new cities of the [[Southern France|Midi]] that appeared in the 12th and 13th centuries. Until the [[Early modern Europe|early modern period]], the two remained separate cities: Clermont, an episcopal city; Montferrand, a [[Count|comital]] one.

===Early modern and modern eras===
[[File:Clermont-Ferrand 23-7-2011 (3).JPG|thumb|[[Hôtel de Ville, Clermont-Ferrand|Hôtel de Ville]]]]
Clermont became a royal city in 1551, and in 1610, the inseparable property of the French Crown. On 15 April 1630 the Edict of Troyes (the First Edict of Union) joined the two cities of Clermont and [[Montferrand (district of Clermont-Ferrand)|Montferrand]]. This union was confirmed in 1731 by [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] with the Second Edict of Union. At this time, Montferrand was no more than a [[Satellite town|satellite city]] of Clermont, and it remained so until the beginning of the 20th century. Wishing to retain its independence, Montferrand made three demands for independence, in 1789, 1848, and 1863. The [[Hôtel de Ville, Clermont-Ferrand|Hôtel de Ville]] (City Hall) was completed in 1844.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.clermontauvergnevolcans.com/fiches/hotel-de-ville-de-clermont-ferrand/|title=Hôtel de ville de Clermont-Ferrand|publisher=Clermont Auvergne Volcans|access-date=27 October 2024}}</ref>

In the 20th century, the construction of the [[Michelin]] factories and of city gardens, which shaped modern Clermont-Ferrand, united the two cities, although two distinct downtowns survive and Montferrand retains a strong identity.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Clermont-Ferrand has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Cfb]]). The city is in the rain shadow of the Chaîne des Puys, giving it one of the driest climates in metropolitan France, except for a few places around the Mediterranean Sea. The mountains also block most of the oceanic influence of the Atlantic, which creates a much more continental climate than in nearby cities west or north of the mountains, like [[Limoges]] and [[Montluçon]]. Thus the city has comparatively cold winters and hot summers. From November to March, frost is very frequent, and the city, being at the bottom of a valley, is frequently subject to [[Inversion (meteorology)|temperature inversion]], in which the mountains are sunny and warm, and the plain is freezing cold and cloudy. Snow is quite common, although usually short-lived and light. Summer temperatures often exceed {{convert|35|°C|0|abbr=on}}, with sometimes violent thunderstorms. The highest temperature was reached in 2019 of {{convert|40.9|°C|1|abbr=on}} while the lowest was {{convert|-29.0|°C|1|abbr=on}}.

====Religious architecture====
[[File:Place victoire clermont-ferrand.jpg|thumb|[[Clermont-Ferrand Cathedral|Clermont-Ferrand Cathedral of Notre-Dame de l'Assomption]]]]
Clermont-Ferrand has two famous churches. One is [[Notre-Dame du Port]], a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church which was built during the 11th and 12th centuries (the [[bell tower]] was rebuilt during the 19th century). It was nominated as a [[World Heritage Site]] by UNESCO in 1998. The other is [[Clermont-Ferrand Cathedral]] (''Cathédrale Notre-Dame-de-l'Assomption de Clermont-Ferrand''), built in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] between the 13th and the 19th centuries.

====Parks and gardens====

== Economy and infrastructure ==
[[Food industry|Food production]] and processing as well as engineering are major employers in the area, as are the many research facilities of leading computer software and [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] companies.

The city's industry was for a long time linked to the French [[tire|tyre]] manufacturer [[Michelin]], which created the [[Radial tire|radial tyre]] and expanded from Clermont-Ferrand to become a worldwide leader in its industry. For most of the 20th century, it had extensive factories throughout the city, employing up to 30,000 workers. While the company has maintained its headquarters in the city, most of the manufacturing is now done in foreign countries. This downsizing took place gradually, allowing the city to court new investment in other industries, thus avoiding the fate of many post-industrial cities and keeping it a very wealthy and prosperous area home to many high-income executives.

=== Transport ===
[[File:Clermont-tram-place-de-jaude.jpg|thumbnail|Tramway in Clermont-Ferrand]]
The [[Gare de Clermont-Ferrand|main railway station]] has connections to [[Paris]] and several regional destinations: Lyon, Moulins via [[Vichy]], [[Le Puy-en-Velay]], [[Aurillac]], [[Nîmes]], [[Issoire]], [[Montluçon]] and [[Thiers, Puy-de-Dôme|Thiers]].

The [[A71 autoroute|A71]] motorway connects Clermont-Ferrand with [[Orléans]] and [[Bourges]], the [[A75 autoroute|A75]] with [[Montpellier]] and the [[A89 autoroute|A89]] with [[Bordeaux]], Lyon and [[Saint-Étienne]] ([[A72 autoroute|A72]]). The [[Clermont-Ferrand Auvergne Airport|airport]] offers flights within France. Recently, Clermont-Ferrand was France's first city to get a new [[Translohr]] transit system, the [[Clermont-Ferrand Tramway]], thereby linking the city's north and south neighbourhoods.

The [[TGV]] will arrive in Auvergne after 2030. It will be one of the last regions not to have a TGV stop.

[[Clermont-Ferrand Auvergne Airport]] serves only a handful of mostly domestic destinations.

Clermont-Ferrand was the home of mathematician and philosopher [[Blaise Pascal]], who tested [[Evangelista Torricelli]]'s hypothesis concerning the influence of [[Partial pressure|gas pressure]] on liquid equilibrium. This is the experiment in which a [[vacuum]] is created in a mercury tube; Pascal's experiment had his brother-in-law carry a [[barometer]] to the top of the [[Puy-de-Dôme (mountain)|Puy-de-Dôme]]. The [[Blaise Pascal University|Université Blaise-Pascal]] (or Clermont-Ferrand II) was located primarily in the city and is named after him.

{{anchor|Short Film Festival}}Clermont-Ferrand also hosts the [[Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival]], the world's first international short film festival, which originated in 1979. This festival, which brings thousands of people every year (137,000 in 2008) to the city, is the second [[Cinema of France|French film]] Festival after Cannes in terms of visitors, but ranks first for spectators (in Cannes, visitors are not allowed in theatres, only professionals). This festival has revealed many young talented directors who are now well known in France and internationally, such as [[Mathieu Kassovitz]], [[Cédric Klapisch]] and Éric Zonka.

Beside the short film festival, Clermont-Ferrand hosts more than twenty music, film, dance, theatre and video and digital art festivals every year. With more than 800 artistic groups from dance to music, Clermont-Ferrand and the Auvergne region's cultural life is significant in France. One of the city's nicknames is "The Liverpool of France". Groups such as The Elderberries and [[Cocoon (band)|Cocoon]] were formed there.

Additionally, the city was the subject of the acclaimed documentary ''[[The Sorrow and the Pity]]'', which used Clermont-Ferrand as the basis of the film, telling the story of France under [[Nazism|Nazi]] occupation and the [[Vichy regime]] of Marshal [[Philippe Pétain|Pétain]]. [[Pierre Laval]], Pétain's "handman", was an ''Auvergnat''.

''[[My Night at Maud's]]'' ({{langx|fr|Ma nuit chez Maud}}), a 1969 French [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] by [[Éric Rohmer]], was set and filmed in Clermont-Ferrand in and around Christmas Eve.<ref>James Monaco. ''The New Wave''. New York: Oxford University Press. 1976. p. 303.</ref> It is the third film (fourth in order of release) in his series of ''[[Six Moral Tales]]''. [[Pascal's wager]], a philosophical and theological [[thought experiment]] from [[Blaise Pascal]]'s ''[[Pensées]]'', is a major theme in the film. Pascal was born in Clermont-Ferrand in 1623.

The city also hosts ''[[L'Aventure Michelin]]'', the museum dedicated to the history of Michelin group.

===Sport===
A [[List of Formula One circuits|racing circuit]] close to the city, the [[Charade Circuit]], using closed-off [[Highway|public road]]s, held the [[French Grand Prix]] in [[1965 Formula One season|1965]], [[1969 Formula One season|1969]], [[1970 Formula One season|1970]] and [[1972 Formula One season|1972]]. It was a daunting circuit, with such harsh elevation changes that some drivers became ill as they drove. Winners included [[Jim Clark]], [[Jackie Stewart]] (twice), and [[Jochen Rindt]].

Clermont-Ferrand has some experience in hosting major international sports tournaments, including the FIBA [[EuroBasket 1999]]. The city was the finish of [[Tour de France]] stages in 1951 and 1959, and will host the start of the [[2023 Tour de France Femmes]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |date=2022-10-27 |title=Tour de France 2023: routes reach for the sky with limited sprint chances |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/oct/27/tour-de-france-announces-2023-routes |access-date=2022-11-02 |website=the Guardian |language=en}}</ref>

The city is also home to a [[rugby union]] club competing at international level, [[ASM Clermont Auvergne]], as well as [[Clermont Foot|Clermont Foot Auvergne]], a football club that has competed in France's top tier, [[Ligue 1]], since the 2021/22 season.

In the [[Rugby sevens|sevens version]] of rugby union, Clermont-Ferrand has hosted the [[France Women's Sevens]], the final event in each season's [[World Rugby Women's Sevens Series]],  since [[2015-16 World Rugby Women's Sevens Series|2016]].
