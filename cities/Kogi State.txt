Kogi State has been inhabited for years by various ethnic groups, including the [[Igala people|Igala]], [[Ebira people|Ebira]], [[Ogori-Magongo language|Oko]] [[Ogori-Magongo people|(Mainly Ogori and Magongo), Gbagyi]], and [[Nupe people|Nupe]] (mainly the [[Bassa Nge people|Bassa Nge]], [[Kakanda language|Kakanda]], and [[Kupa language|Kupa]] subgroups) in the state's center; the Igala (most dominant in the east), [[Agatu language|Agatu]], [[Basa-Benue language|Basa-Komo]] and [[Idoma people|Idoma]] in the east;<ref>{{Cite web |title=Place: Kogi, Nigeria - Genealogy |url=https://www.werelate.org/wiki/Place:Kogi,_Nigeria |access-date=2022-11-04 |website=www.werelate.org}}</ref> and the (mainly the [[Okun people|Okun]], [[Oko language|Ogori]], [[Oworo people|Oworo]], and [[Ogori/Magongo|Magongo]] subgroups) in the west and central.<ref>{{Cite web |last=kogistatehub |date=2022-03-17 |title=Indigenous Languages Spoken in Kogi State |url=https://kogistatehub.com/languages-spoken-in-kogi-state/ |access-date=2023-09-03 |website=Kogi State Hub |language=en-US}}</ref>

In the pre-colonial period, the area that is now Kogi State was split up between various states with some states being tiny and village-based as others were part of larger empires like the [[Nupe Kingdom]] which held much of now-western Kogi State until the early 1800s when the [[Fulani jihad]] annexed the kingdom and placed the area under the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] while the Eastern half of the State is the land of the ancient Igala Kingdom. In the 1900s and 1910s, British expeditions occupied the area and incorporated them into the [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000065575 |access-date=2022-11-04 |website=unesdoc.unesco.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=History of Nigeria |url=https://www.nigerianembmexico.org/history-of-nigeria |access-date=2022-11-04 |website=nigerianembmexico |language=en}}</ref> with its capital as Lokoja until 1903. The protectorate later merged into [[British Nigeria]] before becoming independent as Nigeria in 1960. Originally, modern-day Kogi State was a part of the post-independence [[Northern Region, Nigeria|Northern Region]] until 1967 when the region was split and the area became part of the [[North-Western State]], [[Kwara State]], and [[Benue-Plateau State]]. After the defunct Benue-Plateau and the North-Western states were splitted in 1976, Kogi became a part of the new [[Benue State|Benue]] and Niger states along with Kwara. Western Benue State, southeastern Kwara State, and far southern Niger State were carved out to form the new Kogi State.

Economically, Kogi State is largely based around [[agriculture]], mainly of [[Coffea robusta|coffee]], [[cashew]], [[Peanut|groundnut]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[oil palm]], and [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]] crops. Other key industries are coal, limestone, marbles, Iron-Ore, feldspar, clay, cassiterite, columbite and tantalite, gold, gems, quartz, mica  [[crude oil]] extraction and the [[herding|livestock herding]] of [[cattle]], [[goats]], and [[sheep]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Akanbi |first1=Festus |title=As Anambra, Kogi Join Oil-producing States |url=https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2021/09/19/as-anambra-kogi-join-oil-producing-states/ |website=[[ThisDay]] |access-date=25 December 2021}}</ref> Kogi has both the [[List of Nigerian states by Human Development Index#2022|9th highest]] [[Human Development Index]] and [[GDP]] in the country.<ref>{{cite web |title=Human Development Indices |url=https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/shdi/ |website=Global Data Lab |access-date=15 December 2021}}</ref>
