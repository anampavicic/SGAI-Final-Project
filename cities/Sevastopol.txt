Due to its strategic location and the navigability of the city's harbours, Sevastopol has been an important [[Port of Sevastopol|port]] and [[Sevastopol Naval Base|naval base]] throughout its history. Since the city's founding in 1783 it has been a major base for Russia's [[Black Sea Fleet]]. During the [[Cold War]] of the 20th century, it was a [[closed city]]. The total administrative area is {{convert|864|km2}} and includes a significant amount of rural land. The urban population, largely concentrated around [[Sevastopol Bay]], is 479,394,<ref name=stats2021/> and the total population is 547,820.<ref name=2021Census>{{cite web|title=Оценка численности постоянного населения по субъектам Российской Федерации|url=https://rosstat.gov.ru/storage/mediabank/tab-5_VPN-2020.xlsx|publisher=[[Federal State Statistics Service (Russia)|Federal State Statistics Service]]|accessdate=1 September 2022}}</ref>

Sevastopol, along with the rest of Crimea, is internationally recognised as part of [[Ukraine]], and under the Ukrainian legal framework, it is administratively one of two [[city with special status|cities with special status]] (the other being [[Kyiv]]). However, it has been occupied by [[Russia]] since 27 February 2014, before Russia [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexed Crimea]] on 18 March 2014 and gave it the status of a [[federal cities of Russia|federal city of Russia]]. Both Ukraine and Russia consider the city administratively separate from the [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] and the [[Republic of Crimea (Russia)|Republic of Crimea]], respectively. The city's population has an ethnic [[Russians|Russian]] majority and a substantial minority of [[Ukrainians]] and [[Crimean Tatars]].

Sevastopol's unique naval and [[maritime]] features have been the basis for a robust economy. The city enjoys mild winters and moderately warm summers, characteristics that help make it a popular [[seaside resort]] and tourist destination, mainly for visitors from the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|former Soviet republics]]. The city is also an important centre for [[marine biology]] research. In particular, the military has studied and trained [[dolphin]]s in the city for [[Military marine mammal|military use]] since the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Narula|first=Svati Kirsten|date=2014-03-26 |title=Ukraine Was Never Crazy About Its Killer Dolphins, Anyway|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/03/ukraine-was-never-crazy-about-its-killer-dolphins-anyway/359647/|access-date=2022-02-03|website=The Atlantic|language=en}}</ref>

==Etymology==
{{Moresources|section|date=August 2022}}
The name of Sevastopolis was originally chosen following the same [[etymology|etymological]] trend as other cities in the Crimean peninsula; it was intended to express its ancient Greek origins. It is a compound of the Greek adjective, {{lang |grc|σεβαστός}} (''[[sebastos|sebastós]]'', {{IPA|grc-x-byzant|sevasˈtos|link=yes}}; 'venerable') and the noun {{lang|grc|πόλις}} (''pólis'', 'city'). {{lang|grc|Σεβαστός}} is the traditional Greek equivalent (see [[Sebastian (name)|Sebastian]]) of the Roman honorific ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'', originally given to the first emperor of the Roman Empire, [[Augustus]] and later awarded as a title to his successors.

The city was probably named after Empress ("[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]") [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] of the [[Russian Empire]] who founded Sevastopol in 1783. She visited the city in 1787, accompanied by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], the Emperor of Austria, and other foreign dignitaries.

In the west of the city, there are well-preserved ruins of the ancient Greek port city of [[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]], founded in the 5th<ref name="A1">{{cite web|url=https://www.wmf.org/project/ancient-chersonesos/|title=Ancient Chersonesos|work=wmf.org/|access-date= 25 December 2020|language=en |trans-title=Ancient Chersonesos}}</ref> century BC by settlers from [[Heraclea Pontica]]. This name means "peninsula", reflecting its immediate location. It is not related to the ancient Greek name for the Crimean Peninsula as a whole: ''Chersonēsos [[Taurica|Taurikē]]'' ("the [[Tauri]]an Peninsula").

{{anchor|spelling}}The name of the city is spelled as:

===Ancient Chersonesus===
In the 6th century BC, a Greek colony was established in the area of the modern-day city. The Greek city of [[Chersonesus (Crimea)|Chersonesus]] existed for almost two thousand years, first as an independent democracy and later as part of the [[Bosporan Kingdom]]. In the 13th and 14th centuries, it was sacked by the [[Golden Horde]] several times and was finally totally abandoned. The modern day city of Sevastopol has no connection to the ancient and medieval Greek city other than geographical location, but the ruins are a popular tourist attraction located on the outskirts of the city.

===Part of the Russian Empire===

Sevastopol was founded in June 1783 as a base for a naval squadron under the name Akhtiar<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://leksika.com.ua/19111014/ure/sevastopol | contribution = Sevastopol | title = The Ukrainian Soviet Encyclopedia | publisher = Leksika | place = [[Ukraine|UK]]| title-link = Ukrainian Soviet Encyclopedia }}</ref> (''White Cliff''),<ref name=bse>{{Cite book | url = http://bse.sci-lib.com/article100495.html | title = Севастополь (Sevastopol)| publisher = [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] | place = [[Moscow]]| language = ru }}</ref> by Rear Admiral [[Thomas MacKenzie (Russian admiral)|Thomas MacKenzie]] (Foma Fomich Makenzi), a native [[Scottish people|Scot]] in Russian service; soon after [[Russian Empire|Russia]] annexed the [[Crimean Khanate]]. Five years earlier, [[Aleksandr Suvorov|Alexander Suvorov]] ordered that earthworks be erected along the harbour and Russian troops be placed there. 

In February 1784, [[Catherine the Great]] ordered [[Grigory Potyomkin|Grigory Potemkin]] to build a fortress there and call it Sevastopol. The realisation of the initial building plans fell to Captain [[Fyodor Ushakov]] who in 1788 was named commander of the [[Port of Sevastopol|port]] and of the [[Black Sea Fleet|Black Sea squadron]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sevastopol.info/history/hist_first.htm|title=Основание и развитие Севастополя (Osnovaniye i razvitiye Sevastopolya) |trans-title=Foundation and development of Sevastopol | publisher = Sevastopol.info|date=28 May 2007| access-date=26 April 2010|language=ru}}</ref> The city was established on the western shore of Southern Bay which branches away from the bigger [[Sevastopol Bay]]. The ruins of ancient Chersonesus were situated to the west. The newly built settlement became an important [[naval base]] and later a commercial [[seaport]]. In 1797, under an edict issued by Emperor [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]], the military stronghold was again renamed Akhtiar. Finally, on 29 April (10 May), 1826, the Senate returned the city's name to Sevastopol.{{cn|date=July 2022}} In 1803 to 1864 along with [[Mykolaiv]] the city was part of Nikolayev–Sevastopol Military Governorate.

===Crimean War===
{{Main|Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855)}}
From 1853 to 1856, the Crimean peninsula's strategic position in controlling the Black Sea caused it to be the site of the principal engagements of the [[Crimean War]], where Russia lost to a French-led alliance.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Crimean War (1853–1856)|journal=Gale Encyclopedia of World History: War|year=2008|volume=2|url=http://www.omnilogos.com/2015/01/crimean-war-1853-1856.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416183025/http://www.omnilogos.com/2015/01/crimean-war-1853-1856.html|archive-date=16 April 2015}}</ref>

After a minor skirmish at [[Constanța|Köstence]] (now [[Constanța]]), the allied commanders decided to attack Sevastopol as Russia's main naval base in the Black Sea. After extended preparations, allied forces landed on the peninsula in September 1854 and marched to a point south of Sevastopol after winning the [[Battle of the Alma]] on 20 September. The Russians counterattacked on 25 October in what became the [[Battle of Balaclava]] and were repulsed, but the [[British Army during the Victorian Era|British Army]]'s forces were seriously depleted as a result. A second Russian counterattack, [[Battle of Inkerman|at Inkerman]] in November, ended in a stalemate as well. The front settled into the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855)|siege of Sevastopol]], involving brutal conditions for troops on both sides.

Sevastopol finally fell after eleven months, after the French [[Battle of Malakoff|had assaulted Fort Malakoff]]. Isolated and facing a bleak prospect of invasion by the West if the war continued, Russia [[suing for peace|sued for peace]] in March 1856. France and Britain welcomed the development, owing to the conflict's domestic unpopularity. The [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], signed on 30 March 1856, ended the war and forbade Russia from basing warships in the Black Sea.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Figes|first=Orlando|author-link=Orlando Figes|title=Crimea: The Last Crusade|publisher=Allen Lane|year=2010|isbn=978-0-7139-9704-0|location=London |page=415}}</ref> This hampered the Russians during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78]] and in the aftermath of that conflict, Russia moved to reconstitute its naval strength and fortifications in the Black Sea.{{cn|date=February 2023}}

===World War II===
{{main|Siege of Sevastopol (1941–1942)}}
During [[World War II]], Sevastopol withstood intensive bombardment by the Germans in 1941–42, supported by their Italian and Romanian allies during the [[Battle of Sevastopol]]. German forces used [[railway artillery]]—including history's largest-ever calibre railway artillery piece in battle, the 80-cm calibre ''[[Schwerer Gustav]]''—and [[Karl-Gerät|specialised mobile heavy mortars]] to destroy Sevastopol's extremely heavy fortifications, such as the [[Maxim Gorky Fortresses]].

It was liberated by the [[Red Army]] on 9 May 1944 and was awarded the [[Hero City (Soviet Union)|Hero City]] title a year later.

===Part of the Ukrainian SSR===
During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, Sevastopol became a so-called "[[closed city]]". This meant that any non-residents had to apply to the authorities for a temporary permit to visit the city.

On 29 October 1948, the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Russian SFSR issued an ''ukaz'' (order) which confirmed the special status of the city.<ref name=myths/> Soviet academic publications since 1954, including the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'', indicated that Sevastopol, [[Crimean Oblast]] was part of the [[Ukrainian SSR]].<ref>''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' 1976, Vol.23. p. 104</ref><ref name=bse/>

In 1954, under [[Nikita Khrushchev]], both Sevastopol and the remainder of the Crimean peninsula were administratively [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transferred]] from being territories within the Russian SFSR to being territories administered by the Ukrainian SSR. Administratively, Sevastopol was a municipality excluded from the adjacent [[Crimean Oblast]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}{{explain|date=December 2018}} The territory of the municipality was 863.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and it was further subdivided into four raions (districts). Besides the City of Sevastopol proper, it also included two towns—Balaklava (having had no status until 1957), Inkerman, urban-type settlement Kacha, and 29 villages.<ref name=YavlinskyUkr>{{cite book|url={{GBurl|id=tedMMgz3RV8C|p=44}} |title=Contemporary Ukraine|isbn=0-7656-3150-4|last1=Kuzio|first1=Taras|date=15 April 1998|publisher=M.E.

<!--Following the break-up of the Soviet Union, the [[Congress of People's Deputies of Russia]] "questioned" the legal status of Sevastopol and requested the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia]] to "define" it.

On 11 December 1992, the [[President of Ukraine]] called the attempt of the Russian deputies to charge the Russian parliament with the task of defining the status of Sevastopol as an "imperial disease". On 17 December 1992, the Office of the Ukrainian Presidential Representative in [[Crimea]] was created, which caused a wave of protests a month later. Among the protesters who organised the unsanctioned rally were the Sevastopol branches of the National Salvation Front, the Russian Popular Assembly, and the All-Crimean Movement of the Voters for the Republic of Crimea. The protest was held in Sevastopol on 10 January on [[Nakhimov Square]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Following [[Ukraine]]'s declaration of [[History of Ukraine#Independence|independence]] from the USSR in 1991, Sevastopol became the principal base of the [[Ukrainian navy]]. As the key naval base of the former Soviet [[Black Sea Fleet]], it was a source of tensions for [[Russia–Ukraine relations]] until a [[Partition Treaty on the Status and Conditions of the Black Sea Fleet|set-term lease agreement]] was signed in 1997.

On 10 July 1993, the [[Russian parliament]] passed a resolution declaring Sevastopol to be "a federal Russian city".<ref name="doyle">''Secession as an International Phenomenon: From America's Civil War to Contemporary Separatist Movements'' edited by Don Harrison Doyle (page 284)</ref> At the time, many supporters of President [[Boris Yeltsin]] had ceased taking part in{{clarify|date=October 2022}} the parliament's work.<ref>{{Citation | first = Serge | last = Schmemann | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/10/world/russian-parliament-votes-a-claim-to-ukrainian-port-of-sevastopol.html | title = Russian Parliament Votes a Claim to Russian Port of Sevastopol | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = 10 July 1993}}</ref> On 20 July 1993, the [[United Nations Security Council]] denounced the decision of the Russian parliament.

On 14 April 1993, the Presidium of the Crimean Parliament called for the creation of the presidential post of the Crimean Republic.{{clarify|date=October 2022}} A week later, the Russian deputy, Valentin Agafonov, said that [[Russia]] was ready to supervise a referendum on Crimean independence and include the republic as a separate entity in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]]. On 28 July 1993, one of the leaders of the Russian Society of Crimea, Viktor Prusakov, said that his organisation was ready for an armed mutiny and the establishment of Russian administration of Sevastopol.

In September, the commander of the joint Russian-Ukrainian Black Sea Fleet, {{ill|Eduard Baltin|ru|Балтин, Эдуард Дмитриевич|vertical-align=sup}}, accused Ukraine of converting some of his fleet and conducting an armed assault on his personnel and threatened to take countermeasures placing the fleet on alert. (In June 1992, the Russian president Yeltsin and the Ukrainian president [[Leonid Kravchuk]] had agreed to divide the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet between Russia and Ukraine.

The ex-Soviet Black Sea Fleet and its facilities were divided between Russia's Black Sea Fleet and the [[Ukrainian Navy|Ukrainian Naval Forces]]. The two navies co-used some of the city's harbours and piers, while others were demilitarised or used by either{{clarify|date=October 2022}} country. Sevastopol remained the location of the Russian Black Sea Fleet headquarters, and the Ukrainian Naval Forces Headquarters were also located in the city. A judicial row periodically continued over the naval [[hydrography|hydrographic]] infrastructure both in Sevastopol and on the Crimean coast (especially [[lighthouses]] historically maintained by the Soviet and Russian Navy and also used for civil navigation support).

As in the rest of Crimea, Russian remained the predominant language of the city, although following the independence of Ukraine there were some attempts at [[Ukrainisation]], with very little success. Russian society in general and even some outspoken government representatives never accepted the loss of Sevastopol and tended to regard it as temporarily separated from Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ua.pravda.com.ua/news/2007/2/21/54793.htm|title=Лужков знайшов у серці рану і хоче почувати себе в Криму як вдома|work=pravda.com.ua|trans-title=Luzhkov has found a wound in his heart and wants to feel at home in the Crimea|language=uk|access-date=22 March 2007|archive-date=19 March 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319203900/http://ua.pravda.com.ua/news/2007/2/21/54793.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The city of Sevastopol is located at the southwestern tip of the Crimean peninsula in a headland known as [[Heracles peninsula]] on a coast of the [[Black Sea]]. The city is designated a special city-region of Ukraine which besides the city itself includes several of its outlying settlements. The city itself is concentrated mostly in the western portion of the region and around the long [[Bay of Sevastopol]]. This bay is a [[ria]], a river canyon drowned by [[Holocene]] sea-level rise, and the outlet of [[Chorna River (Crimea)|Chorna River]]. Away in a remote location southeast of Sevastopol is located the former city of [[Balaklava]] (since 1957 incorporated within Sevastopol), the bay of which in the Soviet era served as a main port for the Soviet diesel-powered submarines.

The coastline of the region is mostly rocky, in a series of smaller bays, a great number of which are located within the Bay of Sevastopol. The biggest of them are Southern Bay (within the Bay of Sevastopol), Archer Bay, a gulf complex that consists of Deergrass Bay, the Bay of Cossack, Salty Bay, and many others. There are over thirty bays in the immediate region.

Three rivers flow through the region: the Belbek, Chorna, and Kacha. All three mountain chains of the [[Crimean mountains]] are represented in Sevastopol, the southern chain by the Balaklava Highlands, the inner chain by the Mekenziev Mountains, and the outer chain by the Kara-Tau Upland (Black Mountain).

===Climate===
Sevastopol has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa''). Due to the summer mean straddling {{convert|22|C|F}} it borders on a four-season [[oceanic climate]], with cold winters and warm summers.

The average yearly temperature is {{convert|15|–|16|C|F}} during the day and around {{convert|9|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night. In the coldest months, January and February, the average temperature is {{convert|5|–|6|C|F}} during the day and around {{convert|1|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night. In the warmest months, July and August, the average temperature is around {{convert|26|°C|°F|abbr=on}} during the day and around {{convert|19|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at night. Generally, the summer/holiday season lasts 5 months, from around mid-May and into September, with the temperature often reaching {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}} or more in the first half of October.

The average annual temperature of the sea is {{convert|14.2|°C|0|abbr=on}}, ranging from {{convert|7|°C|0|abbr=on}} in February to {{convert|24|°C|0|abbr=on}} in August. From June to September, the average sea temperature is greater than {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}}. In the second half of May and the first half of October; the average sea temperature is about {{convert|17|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The average rainfall is about {{convert|400|mm|in}} per year.
