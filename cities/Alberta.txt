'''Alberta'''  is one of the thirteen [[provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]] of Canada. It is a part of [[Western Canada]] and is one of the three [[Canadian Prairies|prairie provinces]]. Alberta borders [[British Columbia]] to the west, [[Saskatchewan]] to the east, the [[Northwest Territories]] to the north, and the [[U.S. state]] of [[Montana]] to the south. It is one of the only two landlocked provinces in Canada, with Saskatchewan being the other.<ref name=":3">{{cite web|date=April 1, 2011|title=Get to know Canada - Provinces and territories|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/prepare-life-canada/provinces-territories.html|access-date=October 16, 2020|website=aem|archive-date=October 18, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201018025653/https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/prepare-life-canada/provinces-territories.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The eastern part of the province is occupied by the [[Great Plains]], while the western part borders the [[Rocky Mountains]].

Until the 1930s, [[Politics of Alberta|Alberta's political landscape]] consisted of two major parties: the centre-left [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberals]] and the [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] [[United Farmers of Alberta]]. Today, Alberta is generally perceived as a conservative province. The right-wing [[Alberta Social Credit Party|Social Credit Party]] held office continually from 1935 to 1971 before the centre-right [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservatives]] held office continually from 1971 to 2015, the latter being the longest unbroken run in government at the provincial or federal level in Canadian history.

Since before becoming part of Canada, Alberta has been home to several [[First Nations in Alberta|First Nations]] like [[Plains Indians]] and [[Woodland Cree]]. It was also a territory used by [[fur trade]]rs of the rival companies [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and [[North West Company]]. The Dominion of Canada bought the lands that would become Alberta as part of the NWT in 1870.<ref>{{cite web |title=History & Geology|url=https://www.bowvalleynaturalists.org/natural-history/banff-snail/history-geology/|access-date=October 16, 2020|website=Bow Valley Naturalists|language=en-CA|archive-date=February 14, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210214081724/https://www.bowvalleynaturalists.org/natural-history/banff-snail/history-geology/|url-status=dead}}</ref> From the late 1800s to early 1900s, many immigrants arrived to prevent the prairies from being annexed by the United States. Growing wheat and cattle ranching also became very profitable.

Princess Louise was the wife of [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne]], [[Governor General of Canada]] (1878–83).

Alberta's southern border is the [[49th parallel north]], which [[Canada–United States border|separates it]] from the U.S. state of [[Montana]]. The [[60th parallel north]] divides Alberta from the [[Northwest Territories]]. The [[110th meridian west]] separates it from the province of [[Saskatchewan]]; while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the [[120th meridian west]] south from the Northwest Territories at 60°N until it reaches the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]] at the [[Rocky Mountains]], and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the Continental Divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at 49°N.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Alberta-province|title=Alberta, Canada|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=September 20, 2017|archive-date=September 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921052209/https://www.britannica.com/place/Alberta-province|url-status=live}}</ref>

Alberta's capital city, [[Edmonton]], is at about the geographic centre of the province. It is the most northerly major city in Canada and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern Canada. With its proximity to Canada's largest oil fields, the region has most of western Canada's oil refinery capacity. Calgary is about {{cvt|280|km}} south of Edmonton and {{cvt|240|km}} north of Montana, surrounded by extensive ranching country. Almost 75% of the province's population lives in the [[Calgary–Edmonton Corridor]]. The land grant policy to the railways served as a means to populate the province in its early years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://railways.library.ualberta.ca/Maps-2-2-5|title=Atlas of Alberta Railways Maps – Alberta Land Grants|work=ualberta.ca|access-date=May 15, 2016|archive-date=March 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042350/http://railways.library.ualberta.ca/Maps-2-2-5/|url-status=live}}</ref>
[[File:1 moraine lake pano 2019.jpg|thumb|[[Moraine Lake]] at [[Banff National Park]]. The [[Alberta Mountain forests]] makes up the southwestern boundary of Alberta.]]
Most of the northern half of the province is [[Taiga|boreal forest]], while the Rocky Mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely [[temperate coniferous forest]]s of the [[Alberta Mountain forests]] and [[Alberta–British Columbia foothills forests]]. The southern quarter of the province is [[prairie]], ranging from [[shortgrass prairie]] in the southeastern corner to [[mixed grass prairie]] in an arc to the west and north of it. The central [[aspen parkland]] region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests, from Calgary, north to Edmonton, and then east to [[Lloydminster]], contains the most [[soil fertility|fertile soil]] in the province and most of the population. Much of the unforested part of Alberta is given over either to grain farming or cattle ranching, with [[mixed farming]] more common in the north and centre, while [[ranch]]ing and [[Irrigation|irrigated agriculture]] predominate in the south.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Alberta|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Foundation of Canada|year=2008|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/alberta|access-date=October 1, 2008|archive-date=December 13, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213034807/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/alberta/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Alberta [[badlands]] are in southeastern Alberta, where the [[Red Deer River]] crosses the flat prairie and farmland, and features deep canyons and striking landforms. [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]], near [[Brooks, Alberta|Brooks]], showcases the badlands terrain, desert flora, and remnants from Alberta's past when dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape.

=== Climate ===
[[File:Alberta Köppen.svg|thumb|300px|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] in Alberta]]
Alberta extends for over {{cvt|1200|km}} from north to south; its climate, therefore, varies considerably. Average high temperatures in January range from {{cvt|0|C}} in the southwest to {{cvt|-24|C}} in the far north. The presence of the Rocky Mountains also influences the climate to the southwest, which disrupts the flow of the [[Westerlies|prevailing westerly winds]] and causes them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province, casting a [[rain shadow]] over much of Alberta. The northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the Pacific Ocean cause Alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean. Annual precipitation ranges from {{cvt|300|mm}} in the southeast to {{cvt|450|mm}} in the north, except in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains where total precipitation including snowfall can reach {{cvt|600|mm}} annually.<ref name="aboutab"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Alberta Weather and Climate Data|publisher=Government of Alberta, Department of Agriculture and Rural Development|year=2012|url=http://agriculture.alberta.ca/acis|access-date=May 15, 2016|archive-date=May 19, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160519122523/http://agriculture.alberta.ca/acis/|url-status=live}}</ref>
[[File:Red rock coulee at sunset.jpg|thumb|Southeastern Alberta features a [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] [[steppe]] climate.]]
Northern Alberta is mostly covered by boreal forest and has a [[subarctic climate]]. The agricultural area of [[southern Alberta]] has a semi-arid steppe climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that [[evapotranspiration|evaporates or is used by plants]]. The southeastern corner of Alberta, part of the [[Palliser's Triangle|Palliser Triangle]], experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province, and as a result, suffers frequent [[crop yield]] problems and occasional severe droughts. Western Alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter Chinook winds. Central and parts of northwestern Alberta in the Peace River region are largely aspen parkland, a [[biome]] transitional between prairie to the south and boreal forest to the north.

Alberta has a [[humid continental climate]] with warm summers and cold winters. The province is open to cold Arctic weather systems from the north, which often produce cold winter conditions. As the [[Weather front|fronts]] between the [[air mass]]es shift north and south across Alberta, the temperature can change rapidly. [[Arctic front|Arctic air masses]] in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from {{cvt|-54|C}} in northern Alberta to {{cvt|-46|C}} in southern Alberta, although temperatures at these extremes are rare.

In the summer, continental air masses have produced record maximum temperatures from {{cvt|32|C}} in the mountains to over {{cvt|40|C}} in southeastern Alberta.<ref name="climatlas">{{cite web|title=Climate of Alberta|work=Agroclimatic Atlas of Alberta|publisher=Government of Alberta|year=2003|url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/sag6299|access-date=October 1, 2008|archive-date=August 28, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828144440/http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/sag6299|url-status=live}}</ref> Alberta is a sunny province. Annual bright sunshine totals range between 1,900 up to just under 2,600 hours per year. Northern Alberta gets about 18 hours of daylight in the summer.<ref name="climatlas"/> The average daytime temperatures range from around {{cvt|21|C}} in the [[Rocky Mountains|Rocky Mountain valleys]] and far north, up to around {{cvt|28|C}} in the dry prairie of the southeast. The northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures. The south and east-central portions are prone to drought-like conditions sometimes persisting for several years, although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation, sometimes resulting in flooding.

In the winter, the [[Alberta clipper]], a type of intense, fast-moving winter storm that generally forms over or near the province and, pushed with great speed by the continental polar [[Jet stream|jetstream]], descends over the rest of southern Canada and the northern tier of the United States.<ref name="Alberta Clipper">{{cite web|title=Alberta Clipper|url=http://www.weathernotebook.org/transcripts/2000/02/15.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219182706/http://www.weathernotebook.org/transcripts/2000/02/15.html|archive-date=February 19, 2015|publisher=The Weather Notebook|access-date=October 1, 2012}}</ref> In southwestern Alberta, the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm, dry [[Chinook wind]]s blowing from the mountains, which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period. During one Chinook recorded at [[Pincher Creek]], temperatures soared from {{cvt|-19|to|22|C}} in just one hour.<ref name="aboutab"/> The region around Lethbridge has the most Chinooks, averaging 30 to 35 Chinook days per year. Calgary has a 56% chance of a [[white Christmas (weather)|white Christmas]], while Edmonton has an 86% chance.<ref name=Canadawhitechristmas>{{cite web|title=Chance of White Christmas|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=642F4B39-1|publisher=Environment Canada|access-date=December 6, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301190705/http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En|archive-date=March 1, 2013}}</ref>

After Saskatchewan, Alberta experiences the most [[tornado]]es in Canada with an average of 15 verified per year.<ref name=tornados>{{cite web|last=Vettese|first=Dayna|title=Tornadoes in Canada: Everything you need to know|url=http://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/tornadoes-in-canada-everything-you-need-to-know/25876/0|publisher=[[The Weather Network]]|date=September 4, 2014|access-date=January 8, 2015|archive-date=December 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221032409/http://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/tornadoes-in-canada-everything-you-need-to-know/25876/0|url-status=live}}</ref> Thunderstorms, some of them severe, are frequent in the summer, especially in central and southern Alberta. The region surrounding the Calgary–Edmonton Corridor is notable for having the highest frequency of [[hail]] in Canada, which is caused by [[orographic lift]]ing from the nearby Rocky Mountains, enhancing the updraft/downdraft cycle necessary for the formation of hail.

[[File:Rosa acicularis 8448.JPG|thumb|The [[Rosa acicularis|wild rose]] is the provincial flower of Alberta.]]
In central and northern Alberta the arrival of spring is marked by the early flowering of the [[Pulsatilla nuttalliana|prairie crocus]] (''Pulsatilla nuttalliana'') ''[[anemone]]''; this member of the buttercup family has been recorded flowering as early as March, though April is the usual month for the general population.<ref>[http://plantwatch.naturealberta.ca/plant-information/prairie-crocus Prairie Crocus Information] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515015621/http://plantwatch.naturealberta.ca/plant-information/prairie-crocus |date=May 15, 2013 }} Alberta Plant Watch.

Both yellow and white [[Melilotus|sweet clover]] (''Melilotus'') can be found throughout the southern and central areas of the province.

The trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides. These are largely [[deciduous]], typically [[aspen]], [[Populus|poplar]], and [[willow]]. Many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain. North of the North Saskatchewan River, evergreen forests prevail for thousands of square kilometres. Aspen poplar, [[Populus balsamifera|balsam poplar]] (''Populus balsamifera'') or in some parts [[Populus deltoides|cottonwood]] (''Populus deltoides''), and [[Betula papyrifera|paper birch]] (''Betula papyrifera'') are the primary large deciduous species. [[Conifer]]s include [[jack pine]] (''Pinus banksiana''), Rocky Mountain pine, [[Pinus contorta|lodgepole pine]] (''Pinus contorta''), both white and black [[spruce]], and the deciduous conifer [[Larix laricina|tamarack]] (''Larix laricina'').

==== Fauna ====
[[File:Bighorn Sheep - Kananaskis.jpg|thumb|left|A [[bighorn sheep]] in [[Kananaskis Country]]. The bighorn sheep is the provincial mammal of Alberta.]]
The four climatic regions ([[alpine climate|alpine]], [[Taiga|boreal forest]], [[Aspen parkland|parkland]], and [[prairie]]) of Alberta are home to many different species of animals. The south and central prairie was the homeland of the [[American bison]], also known as buffalo, with its grasses providing pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo. The buffalo population was decimated during early settlement, but since then, buffalo have made a comeback, living on farms and in parks all over Alberta.

[[Herbivore]]s are found throughout the province. [[Moose]], [[mule deer]], [[elk]], and [[white-tailed deer]] are found in the wooded regions, and [[pronghorn]] can be found in the prairies of southern Alberta. [[Bighorn sheep]] and [[mountain goat]]s live in the Rocky Mountains. Rabbits, [[porcupine]]s, [[striped skunk|skunks]], squirrels, and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province. Alberta is home to only one venomous snake species, the [[Crotalus viridis|prairie rattlesnake]].

Alberta is home to many large [[carnivore]]s such as [[wolf|wolves]], [[grizzly bear]]s, [[American black bear|black bears]], and [[Cougar|mountain lions]], which are found in the mountains and wooded regions. Smaller carnivores of the [[canidae|canine]] and [[Felidae|feline]] families include [[coyote]]s, [[red fox]]es, [[Canada lynx]], and [[bobcat]]s. [[Wolverine]]s can also be found in the northwestern areas of the province.
[[File:Alberta Department of Public Health Rat Poster (26497442131).jpg|thumb|Alberta Department of Public Health rat poster (1948)]]
Central and northern Alberta and the region farther north are the nesting ground of many migratory birds. Vast numbers of ducks, [[goose|geese]], [[swan]]s and [[pelican]]s arrive in Alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern Alberta. [[Eagle]]s, [[hawk]]s, owls, and [[crow]]s are plentiful, and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect-eating birds can be found. Alberta, like other [[Temperate climate|temperate]] regions, is home to [[mosquito]]es, [[fly|flies]], [[wasp]]s, and bees. Rivers and lakes are populated with [[Esox|pike]], [[walleye]], [[Freshwater whitefish|whitefish]], [[rainbow trout|rainbow]], [[Brook trout|speckled]], [[brown trout]], and [[sturgeon]]. Native to the province, the [[bull trout]], is the provincial fish and an official [[Symbols of Alberta|symbol of Alberta]]. Turtles are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province. Frogs and [[salamander]]s are a few of the [[amphibian]]s that make their homes in Alberta.

Alberta is the only province in Canada — as well as one of the few places in the world — that is free from [[brown rat|Norwegian rat]]s.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/agdex3441?opendocument| title=The History of Rat Control in Alberta| publisher=Alberta Department of Agriculture| access-date=January 11, 2007| archive-date=August 28, 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828164627/http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/agdex3441?opendocument| url-status=dead}}</ref> Since the early 1950s, the [[Executive Council of Alberta|Government of Alberta]] has operated a rat-control program, which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported, usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail.

Alberta has one of the greatest diversities and abundances of [[Late Cretaceous]] dinosaur fossils worldwide.<ref name="alberta-paleo" /> [[Taxon|Taxa]] are represented by complete fossil skeletons, isolated material, microvertebrate remains, and even [[Bone bed|mass graves]]. At least 38 dinosaur [[Type (biology)|type specimens]] were collected in the province. The [[Foremost Formation]], [[Oldman Formation]] and [[Dinosaur Park Formation]]s collectively comprise the [[Judith River Group]] and are the most thoroughly studied dinosaur-bearing strata in Alberta.<ref name="alberta-paleo" />

Dinosaur-bearing strata are distributed widely throughout Alberta.<ref name="alberta-paleo" /> The [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]] area contains outcrops of the Dinosaur Park Formation and Oldman Formation. In Alberta's central and southern regions are intermittent [[Scollard Formation]] outcrops. In the [[Drumheller]] Valley and [[Edmonton]] regions there are exposed [[Horseshoe Canyon Formation|Horseshoe Canyon]] [[facies]]. Other [[Geological formation|formations]] have been recorded as well, like the [[Milk River Formation|Milk River]] and Foremost Formations. The latter two have a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs, primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of exposed outcrops. Their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites. Additional geologic formations that have produced only a few fossils are the [[Belly River Group]] and [[St. Mary River Formation]]s of the southwest and the northwestern [[Wapiti Formation]], which contains two ''[[Pachyrhinosaurus]]'' bone beds. The [[Bearpaw Formation]] represents strata deposited during a [[marine transgression]].

The first Europeans to visit Alberta were French Canadians during the late 18th century, working as fur traders. French was the predominant language used in some early fur trading forts in the region, such as the first Fort Edmonton (in present-day Fort Saskatchewan). After the [[British America|British arrival in Canada]], approximately half of the province of Alberta, south of the [[Athabasca River]] drainage, became part of [[Rupert's Land]] which consisted of all land drained by rivers flowing into [[Hudson Bay]]. This area was granted by [[Charles II of England]] to the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) in 1670, and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it.

The Athabasca River and the rivers north of it were not in HBC territory because they drained into the [[Arctic Ocean]] instead of Hudson Bay, and they were prime habitats for fur-bearing animals. The first European explorer of the Athabasca region was [[Peter Pond]], who learned of the [[Methye Portage]], which allowed travel from southern rivers into the rivers north of Rupert's Land. Other [[North American fur trade]]rs formed the [[North West Company]] (NWC) of [[Montreal]] to compete with the HBC in 1779. The NWC occupied the northern part of Alberta territory. Peter Pond built Fort Athabasca on [[Lac la Biche (Alberta)|Lac la Biche]] in 1778. [[Roderick Mackenzie of Terrebonne|Roderick Mackenzie]] built [[Fort Chipewyan]] on Lake Athabasca ten years later in 1788. His cousin, Sir [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]], followed the [[North Saskatchewan River]] to its northernmost point near Edmonton, then setting northward on foot, trekked to the Athabasca River, which he followed to Lake Athabasca. It was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name—the [[Mackenzie River]]—which he followed to its outlet in the Arctic Ocean. Returning to Lake Athabasca, he followed the [[Peace River]] upstream, eventually reaching the Pacific Ocean, and so he became the first European to cross the North American continent north of Mexico.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=2521 | title=Alexander Mackenzie Biography | dictionary=Dictionary of Canadian Biography | access-date=January 5, 2006 | archive-date=December 6, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206201528/http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=2521 | url-status=live }}</ref>

The extreme southernmost portion of Alberta was part of the French (and Spanish) territory of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] and was [[Louisiana Purchase|sold to the United States]] in 1803. In the [[Treaty of 1818]], the portion of Louisiana north of the [[49th parallel north|Forty-Ninth Parallel]] was ceded to Great Britain.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Kennedy | first1=D. | last2=Cohen | first2=L. | last3=Bailey | first3=T. | title=The American Pageant: Volume I: To 1877 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwP8bQsT908C&pg=PA265 | publisher=Cengage Learning | date=2010 | location=Boston, MA | page=265 | isbn=978-0-547-16659-9 | access-date=November 22, 2015 | archive-date=July 25, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200725020910/https://books.google.com/books?id=gwP8bQsT908C&pg=PA265 | url-status=live }}</ref>

First Nations negotiated the [[Numbered Treaties]] with [[the Crown]] in which the Crown gained title to the land that would later become Alberta, and the Crown committed to the ongoing support of the First Nations and guaranteed their hunting and fishing rights. The most significant treaties for Alberta are [[Treaty 6]] (1876), [[Treaty 7]] (1877) and [[Treaty 8]] (1899).

The [[District of Alberta]] was created as part of the North-West Territories in 1882. As settlement increased, local representatives to the North-West Legislative Assembly were added. After a long campaign for autonomy, in 1905, the District of Alberta was enlarged and given provincial status, with the election of [[Alexander Cameron Rutherford]] as the first premier. Less than a decade later, the First World War presented special challenges to the new province as an extraordinary number of volunteers left relatively few workers to maintain services and production. Over 50% of Alberta's doctors volunteered for service overseas.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Calgary, Edmonton and the University of Alberta: the extraordinary medical mobilization by Canada's newest province |journal= Can J Surg |year=2017 |volume=60 |doi=10.1503/cjs.012117 |pmc=5608576 |pmid=28930035 | last1 = Da Cambra | first1 = MP | last2 = McAlister | first2 = VC|issue= 5 |pages= 296–299 }}</ref>

Since 2000, Alberta's population has experienced a relatively high rate of growth, mainly because of its burgeoning economy. Between 2003 and 2004, the province had high birthrates (on par with some larger provinces such as British Columbia), relatively high immigration, and a high rate of [[Interprovincial migration in Canada|interprovincial migration]] compared to other provinces.<ref name="Components of population growth of Alberta">{{cite web | url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo33c.htm | title=Components of population growth, by province and territory | publisher=Statistics Canada | access-date=August 7, 2009 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930052549/http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo33c.htm |archive-date=September 30, 2008}}</ref>

Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of [[soil erosion]]. Across the province, the once common [[grain elevator]] is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreasing; farmers typically truck the grain to central points.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gerson|first1=Jen|title=Preserving prairie cathedrals: Progress is leaving Alberta's historic grain elevators in its wake|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/preserving-prairie-cathedrals-progress-is-leaving-albertas-historic-grain-elevators-in-its-wake|access-date=January 18, 2017|work=National Post|date=April 7, 2013|archive-date=June 14, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210614011533/https://nationalpost.com/category/news/|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Industry ===
Alberta is the largest producer of [[petroleum|conventional crude oil]], [[synthetic crude]], [[natural gas]] and gas products in Canada. Alberta is the world's second-largest exporter of natural gas and the fourth-largest producer.<ref name="Alaska and Alberta - An Overview">{{cite web| url=http://economic.alberta.ca/documents/Alaska-AB.pdf| title=Alaska – Alberta Relations| publisher=Government of Alberta| access-date=May 19, 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611125209/http://economic.alberta.ca/documents/Alaska-AB.pdf| archive-date=June 11, 2016| url-status=dead| df=mdy-all}}</ref> Two of the largest producers of [[petrochemical]]s in North America are in central and north-central Alberta. In both Red Deer and Edmonton, [[polyethylene]] and [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] manufacturers produce products that are shipped all over the world. Edmonton's [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] provide the raw materials for a large [[petrochemical industry]] to the east of Edmonton.

The [[Athabasca oil sands]] surrounding [[Fort McMurray]] have estimated [[unconventional oil]] reserves approximately equal to the conventional oil reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be {{convert|1.6e12|oilbbl|km3}}.<ref name="a496">{{cite web | title=How Much CO2 Comes from Alberta Crude Oil?

Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands is the [[price of oil]]. The [[World oil market chronology from 2003|oil price increases since 2003]] have made it profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss. By mid-2014, rising costs and stabilizing oil prices threatened the economic viability of some projects.

Alberta's elections have tended to yield much more conservative outcomes than those of other Canadian provinces. From the 1980s to the 2010s, Alberta had three main political parties, the [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservatives]] ("Conservatives" or "Tories"), the [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberals]], and the social democratic [[Alberta New Democratic Party|New Democrats]]. The [[Wildrose Party]], a more libertarian party formed in early 2008, gained much support in the [[2012 Alberta general election|2012 election]] and became the [[Parliamentary opposition|official opposition]], a role it held until 2017 when it was dissolved and succeeded by the new [[United Conservative Party]] created by the merger of Wildrose and the Progressive Conservatives. The strongly conservative [[Alberta Social Credit Party|Social Credit Party]] was a power in Alberta for many decades, but fell from the political map after the Progressive Conservatives came to power in 1971.

For 44 years the Progressive Conservatives governed Alberta. They lost the [[2015 Alberta general election|2015 election]] to the NDP (which formed their own government for the first time in provincial history, breaking almost 80 consecutive years of right-wing rule),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fraserinstitute.org/article/albertas-rae-days-the-2018-budget-shows-rachel-is-just-like-bob |title=Alberta's Rae Days—the 2018 budget shows Rachel is just like Bob |last=Eisen |first=Ben |publisher=Fraser Institute |date=March 31, 2018 |access-date=September 22, 2018 |quote=When Rachel Notley’s NDP shook Alberta’s political landscape by winning a majority government in 2015, the similarities to Ontario’s Bob Rae NDP government in the 1990s were striking.

All types of municipalities are governed by local residents and were incorporated under various provincial acts, with the exception of improvement districts (governed by either the provincial or federal government), and [[Indian reserve]]s (governed by local [[band government]]s under federal jurisdiction).

=== Law enforcement ===
[[File:RCMP officers Beth, Janice & Harp 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] officers in [[St. Albert, Alberta|St. Albert]]. The RCMP provides municipal policing throughout most of Alberta.]]
Policing in the province of Alberta upon its creation was the responsibility of the [[North-West Mounted Police|Royal Northwest Mounted Police]]. In 1917, due to pressures of the First World War, the [[Alberta Provincial Police]] was created. This organization policed the province until it was disbanded as a [[Great Depression]]-era cost-cutting measure in 1932. It was at that time the, now renamed, [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] resumed policing of the province, specifically RCMP "K" Division. With the advent of the [[Alberta Sheriffs Branch]], the distribution of duties of law enforcement in Alberta has been evolving as certain aspects, such as traffic enforcement, mobile surveillance and the close protection of the Premier of Alberta have been transferred to the Sheriffs. In 2006, Alberta formed the [[Alberta Law Enforcement Response Teams]] (ALERT) to combat organized crime and the serious offences that accompany it. ALERT is made up of members of the RCMP, Sheriffs Branch, and various major municipal police forces in Alberta.

=== Military ===
Military bases in Alberta include [[CFB Cold Lake|Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Cold Lake]], [[CFB Edmonton]], [[CFB Suffield]] and [[CFB Wainwright]].

=== Taxation ===
According to Alberta's 2009 budget, government revenue in that year came mainly from royalties on non-renewable natural resources (30.4%), personal income taxes (22.3%), corporate and other taxes (19.6%), and grants from the [[Government of Canada|federal government]] primarily for infrastructure projects (9.8%).<ref name="budget2009">{{cite web|title=Building On Our Strength|url=http://finance.alberta.ca/publications/budget/budget2009/index.html|website=Finance Alberta|publisher=Government of Alberta|access-date=May 19, 2016|archive-date=May 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511110951/http://finance.alberta.ca/publications/budget/budget2009/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2014, Alberta received $6.1&nbsp;billion in bitumen royalties.

From 2001 to 2016, Alberta was the only Canadian province to have a [[flat tax]] of 10% of taxable income, which was introduced by Premier, [[Ralph Klein]], as part of the Alberta Tax Advantage, which also included a zero-percent tax on income below a "generous personal exemption".<ref name="Maclean's_Teds_20180509">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/the-winners-and-losers-if-alberta-returns-to-a-flat-tax-system/ |title=The winners and losers if Alberta returns to a flat tax system |first=Lindsay |last=Tedds |quote="As the province debates the merits of a less progressive tax system, voters will have to make tradeoffs that help and punish different income earners" |date=May 9, 2018 |access-date=May 21, 2019 |magazine=Maclean's |archive-date=May 10, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510020332/https://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/the-winners-and-losers-if-alberta-returns-to-a-flat-tax-system/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="CRA_2009">{{cite web | url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/fq/txrts-eng.html | title=What are the income tax rates in Canada for 2009? | publisher=Canada Revenue Agency | access-date=August 9, 2009 | archive-date=April 5, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405104815/http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/fq/txrts-eng.html | url-status=live }}</ref>

== Education ==
{{Main|Education in Alberta}}
As with any Canadian province, the Alberta Legislature has (almost) exclusive authority to make laws respecting education. Since 1905, the Legislature has used this capacity to continue the model of locally elected public and separate school boards which originated prior to 1905, as well as to create and regulate universities, colleges, technical institutions, and other educational forms and institutions (public charter schools, private schools, homeschooling).

=== Elementary and secondary ===
There are forty-two public school jurisdictions in Alberta, and seventeen operating separate school jurisdictions. Sixteen of the operating separate school jurisdictions have a Catholic electorate, and one ([[St. Albert, Alberta|St.&nbsp;Albert]]) has a Protestant electorate. In addition, one Protestant separate school district, Glen Avon, survives as a ward of the St. Paul Education Region. The City of Lloydminster straddles the Albertan/Saskatchewan border, and both the public and separate school systems in that city are counted in the above numbers: both of them operate according to Saskatchewan law.

For many years, the provincial government has funded the greater part of the cost of providing K–12 education. Prior to 1994, public and separate school boards in Alberta had the legislative authority to levy a local tax on property as supplementary support for local education. In 1994, the government of the province eliminated this right for public school boards, but not for separate school boards. Since 1994, there has continued to be a tax on property in support of K–12 education; the difference is that the provincial government now sets the mill rate, the money is collected by the local municipal authority and remitted to the provincial government. The relevant legislation requires that all the money raised by this property tax must go to support K–12 education provided by school boards. The provincial government pools the property tax funds from across the province and distributes them, according to a formula, to public and separate school jurisdictions and Francophone authorities.

[[State school|Public]] and separate school boards, charter schools, and private schools all follow the Program of Studies and the curriculum approved by the provincial department of education (Alberta Education). [[Homeschooling|Homeschool]] tutors may choose to follow the Program of Studies or develop their own Program of Studies. Public and separate schools, charter schools, and approved private schools all employ teachers who are certificated by Alberta Education, they administer Provincial Achievement Tests and Diploma Examinations set by Alberta Education, and they may grant high school graduation certificates endorsed by Alberta Education.

=== Post-secondary ===
{{Main|Higher education in Alberta}}
[[File:U of A.jpg|thumb|The [[University of Alberta]] in 2005. The institution is the oldest, and largest university in Alberta.]]
Several publicly funded post-secondary institutions are governed under the province's ''Post-secondary Learning Act''. This includes four comprehensive [[research universities]] that provides undergraduate and graduate degrees, [[Athabasca University]], the [[University of Alberta]], the [[University of Calgary]], and the [[University of Lethbridge]]; and three undergraduate universities that primarily provide [[bachelor's degree]]s, the [[Alberta University of the Arts]], [[Grant MacEwan University]], and [[Mount Royal University]].<ref name=postsec>{{cite web|url=https://www.alberta.ca/types-publicly-funded-post-secondary-institutions.aspx|title=Types of publicly funded institutions|access-date=12 March 2023|year=2023|publisher=Government of Alberta|website=www.alberta.ca}}</ref>

Nine comprehensive community colleges offer primarily offer diploma and certificate programs, [[Bow Valley College]], [[Keyano College]], [[Lakeland College (Alberta)|Lakeland College]], [[Lethbridge College]], [[Medicine Hat College]], [[NorQuest College]], [[Northern Lakes College]], [[Olds College]], and [[Portage College]]. In addition, there are also four [[polytechnic institute]]s that provide specific career training and provides apprenticeships and diplomas, the [[Northern Alberta Institute of Technology]], the [[Southern Alberta Institute of Technology]], [[Northwestern Polytechnic]], and [[Red Deer Polytechnic]]. The [[Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity]] is a specialized arts and cultural institution that is also empowered to provide diploma programs under the ''Post-secondary Learning Act''.<ref name=postsec/>

Alberta is also home to five [[independent school|independent]] postsecondary institutions that provide diplomas/degrees for approved programming, [[Ambrose University]], [[Burman University]], [[Concordia University of Edmonton]], [[The King's University (Edmonton)|The King's University]], and [[St. Mary's University (Calgary)|St. Mary's University]]. Although the five institutions operate under their own legislation, they remain partly governed by the province's ''Post-secondary Learning Act''.<ref name=postsec/> In addition to these institutions, there are also 190 private [[vocational school|career colleges]] in Alberta.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.alberta.ca/private-career-colleges.aspx|title=Private career colleges|access-date=12 March 2023|year=2023|publisher=Government of Alberta|website=www.alberta.ca}}</ref> 
 
There was some controversy in 2005 over the rising cost of post-secondary education for students (as opposed to taxpayers). In 2005, Premier [[Ralph Klein]] made a promise that he would freeze tuition and look into ways of reducing schooling costs.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.su.ualberta.ca/governance/advocacy/ | title=Advocacy | publisher=University of Alberta | access-date=May 19, 2016 | archive-date=June 3, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603114619/https://www.su.ualberta.ca/governance/advocacy/ | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/article.cfm?section=FrontPage&articleID=276&month=2&day=16&year=2005 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810035239/http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/article.cfm?section=FrontPage&articleID=276&month=2&day=16&year=2005 | archive-date=August 10, 2013 | title=Klein promises tuition freeze | last=Bellamy | first=Marshall | work=The Gazette | date=February 16, 2005 | access-date=December 13, 2011}}</ref>{{Update inline|date=March 2023}}

Alberta provides a [[publicly funded health care|publicly funded, fully integrated health system]], through [[Alberta Health Services]] (AHS)—a quasi-independent agency that delivers health care on behalf of the [[Government of Alberta]]'s [[Ministry of Health (Alberta)|Ministry of Health]].<ref name="AB_GOV_2014">{{cite web|url=http://www.health.alberta.ca/|website=Alberta Health|title=Alberta Health|publisher=Government of Alberta|access-date=January 4, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107073622/http://www.health.alberta.ca/|archive-date=January 7, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The Alberta government provides health services for all its residents as set out by the provisions of the ''[[Canada Health Act]]'' of 1984. Alberta became Canada's second province (after [[Saskatchewan]]) to adopt a [[Tommy Douglas]]-style program in 1950, a precursor to the modern [[Medicare (Canada)|medicare]] system.

Alberta's health care budget was $22.5&nbsp;billion during the 2018–2019 fiscal year (approximately 45% of all government spending), making it the best-funded health-care system per-capita in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.alberta.ca/albertaFiles/googlesearch/searchpage.aspx?q=health+funding+2013-2014+site%253Ahealth.alberta.ca&btnG=Google+Search&ud=1&output=xml_no_dtd&oe=UTF-8&ie=UTF-8&client=goa_default&proxystylesheet=goa_default&num=10&sort=date%253AD%253AL%253Ad1&wc=200&wc_mc=1&exclude_apps=1&site=pub_goa|title=Government of Alberta|date=November 7, 2011|access-date=September 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181211185221/https://www.alberta.ca/albertaFiles/googlesearch/searchpage.aspx?q=health+funding+2013-2014+site%253Ahealth.alberta.ca&btnG=Google+Search&ud=1&output=xml_no_dtd&oe=UTF-8&ie=UTF-8&client=goa_default&proxystylesheet=goa_default&num=10&sort=date%253AD%253AL%253Ad1&wc=200&wc_mc=1&exclude_apps=1&site=pub_goa|archive-date=December 11, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Every hour the province spends more than $2.5&nbsp;million, (or $60&nbsp;million per day), to maintain and improve health care in the province.<ref name="Alberta Health Funding: Budget 2018">{{cite web|url=http://www.health.alberta.ca/about/health-funding.html|title=Health Funding: Budget 2018|publisher=Government of Alberta|access-date=April 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107005335/http://www.health.alberta.ca/about/health-funding.html|archive-date=January 7, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Alberta is well-connected by air, with [[international airport]]s in both Calgary and Edmonton. [[Calgary International Airport]] and [[Edmonton International Airport]] are the fourth- and [[List of the busiest airports in Canada|fifth-busiest in Canada]], respectively. Calgary's airport is a hub for [[WestJet|WestJet Airlines]] and a regional hub for [[Air Canada]], primarily serving the prairie provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba) for connecting flights to British Columbia, eastern Canada, fifteen major United States centres, nine European airports, one Asian airport and four destinations in Mexico and the [[Caribbean]].<ref name="Calgary Airport Authority">{{cite web | url=http://www.yyc.com/ | title=Calgary Airport Authority | publisher=Calgary Airport Authority | access-date=August 9, 2009 | archive-date=February 28, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228095308/http://www.yyc.com/ | url-status=live }}</ref> Edmonton's airport acts as a hub for the Canadian north and has connections to all major Canadian airports as well as airports in the United States, Europe, Mexico, and the Caribbean .<ref name="EIA">{{cite web | url=http://www.flyeia.com/ | title=EIA | publisher=Edmonton International Airport | access-date=August 9, 2009 | archive-date=April 18, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418084719/http://www.flyeia.com/ | url-status=live }}</ref>

===Public transit===
Calgary, Edmonton, Red Deer, Medicine Hat, and Lethbridge have substantial [[Public transport|public transit]] systems. In addition to buses, Calgary and Edmonton operate [[Light rail|light rail transit]] (LRT) systems. [[Edmonton LRT]], which is underground in the downtown core and on the surface outside the downtown core was the first of the modern generation of light rail systems to be built in North America, while the Calgary [[CTrain]] has one of the highest numbers of daily riders of any LRT system in North America.

===Rail===

[[File:Hawk Mountain seen from Jasper, Alberta.jpg|thumb|A [[Via Rail]] passenger train passing by freight trains in the background, at [[Jasper station]]]]
There are more than {{cvt|9000|km}} of operating mainline railway in Alberta. The vast majority of this trackage is owned by the [[Canadian Pacific Kansas City]] (CPKC) and [[Canadian National Railway]] (CN) companies, which operate [[Rail freight transport|freight transport]] across the province. Additional railfreight service in the province is provided by two shortline railways: the [[Battle River Railway]] and [[Forty Mile Rail]].

Passenger trains include [[Via Rail]]'s ''[[Canadian (train)|Canadian]]'' (Toronto–Vancouver) and [[Jasper–Prince Rupert train]]s, which use the CN mainline and pass through Jasper National Park and parallel the Yellowhead Highway during at least part of their routes. The [[Rocky Mountaineer]] operates two sections: one from Vancouver to Banff over CP tracks, and a section that travels over CN tracks to Jasper.

Alberta's premier, [[Danielle Smith]] has also confirmed a 15-year master plan to expand passenger rail into Alberta.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Alberta government announces master plan to expand rail passenger service {{!}} Globalnews.ca |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/10458312/alberta-passenger-rail-master-plan/ |access-date=2024-07-16 |website=Global News |language=en-US}}</ref> This plan is set to provide rail services to [[Lethbridge]], [[Medicine Hat]], [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]], [[Grande Prairie|Grand Prairie]], [[Fort McMurray]], and most importantly an intercity rail service between [[Edmonton]] and [[Calgary]], as well as a [[commuter rail]] systems in the respective cities. Groundbreaking is set to start in 2027, according to Transportation Minister [[Devin Dreeshen]].

Highway&nbsp;43 travels northwest into Grande Prairie and the [[Peace River Country]]. Travelling northeast from Edmonton, the [[Alberta Highway 63|Highway 63]] connects to Fort McMurrayand the Athabasca oil sands.<ref name=highwaychart/>

Alberta has two main east–west corridors. The southern corridor, part of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] system, enters the province near Medicine Hat, runs westward through Calgary, and leaves Alberta through Banff National Park. The northern corridor, also part of the Trans-Canada network and known as the [[Yellowhead Highway]] ([[Alberta Highway 16|Highway&nbsp;16]]), runs west from Lloydminster in eastern Alberta, through Edmonton and [[Jasper National Park]] into British Columbia.<ref name=highwaychart/> One of the most scenic drives is along the [[Icefields Parkway]], which runs for {{cvt|228|km}} between Jasper and Lake Louise, with mountain ranges and glaciers on either side of its entire length. A third corridor stretches across southern Alberta; [[Alberta Highway 3|Highway&nbsp;3]] runs between [[Crowsnest Pass]] and Medicine Hat through Lethbridge and forms the eastern portion of the [[Crowsnest Highway]].<ref name=highwaychart/> Another major corridor through central Alberta is [[Alberta Highway 11|Highway&nbsp;11]] (also known as the [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] Highway), which runs east from the [[Saskatchewan River Crossing, Alberta|Saskatchewan River Crossing]] in Banff National Park through [[Rocky Mountain House]] and [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]], connecting with [[Alberta Highway 12|Highway&nbsp;12]], {{cvt|20|km}} west of [[Stettler, Alberta|Stettler]]. The highway connects many of the smaller towns in central Alberta with Calgary and Edmonton, as it crosses Highway&nbsp;2 just west of Red Deer.<ref name=highwaychart/>

Urban stretches of Alberta's major highways and freeways are often called ''trails''. For example, Highway&nbsp;2, the main north–south highway in the province, is called [[Deerfoot Trail]] as it passes through Calgary but becomes [[Calgary Trail & Gateway Boulevard|Calgary Trail (southbound) and Gateway Boulevard (northbound)]] as it enters Edmonton and then turns into [[St. Albert Trail]] as it leaves Edmonton for the City of [[St. Albert, Alberta|St. Albert]]. Calgary, in particular, has a tradition of calling its largest urban [[limited-access road|expressway]]s ''trails'' and naming many of them after prominent [[First Nations in Canada|First Nations]] individuals and tribes, such as [[Crowchild Trail]], Deerfoot Trail, and [[Stoney Trail]].<ref name=Calgarymap>{{cite web|title=Calgary, Alberta |url=https://www.google.ca/maps/@50.9896374,-114.0667851,9.75z?hl=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181008133612/https://www.google.ca/maps/@50.9896374,-114.0667851,9.75z?hl=en |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 8, 2018 |publisher=[[Google Maps]] |access-date=December 8, 2016 |format=Map }}</ref>
