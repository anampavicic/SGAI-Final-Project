'''Quanzhou'''<!--Chinese in infobox--> is a [[prefecture-level city|prefecture-level port city]] on the north bank of the Jin River, beside the [[Taiwan Strait]] in southern [[Fujian]], [[China|People's Republic of China]].{{efn|The PRC also claims [[Kinmen County]] as part of Quanzhou, but it is administered by the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (ROC) as part of its [[Fuchien Province, Republic of China|Fuchien Province]].}} It is Fujian's largest most populous metropolitan region, with an area of {{convert|11,245|km2|sp=us}} and a population of 8,782,285 as of the [[2020 Chinese census|2020 census]]. Its [[City proper|built-up area]] is home to 6,669,711 inhabitants, encompassing the [[Licheng District, Quanzhou|Licheng]], [[Fengze District|Fengze]], and [[Luojiang District, Quanzhou|Luojiang]] [[district (PRC)|urban districts]]; [[Jinjiang, Fujian|Jinjiang]], [[Nan'an, Fujian|Nan'an]], and [[Shishi, Fujian|Shishi]] [[County-level city|cities]]; [[Hui'an]] [[county (PRC)|County]]; and the Quanzhou District for Taiwanese Investment. Quanzhou was China's 12th-largest extended metropolitan area in 2010.

Quanzhou was China's major port for foreign traders, who knew it as '''Zaiton''',{{efn|Zaiton's identification with Quanzhou was controversial in the 19th century, with some scholars preferring to associate Polo and Ibn Battuta's great port with the much more attractive harbor at [[Xiamen]] on a variety of pretexts. The Chinese records are, however, clear as to Quanzhou's former status and the earlier excellence of its harbor, which slowly silted up over the centuries. Alternative spellings include ''Zeiton'' and ''Zaytun''.}} during the 11th through 14th centuries. It was visited by both [[Marco Polo]] and [[Ibn Battuta]]; both travelers praised it as one of the most prosperous and glorious cities in the world. It was the naval base from which the [[Mongolian Empire|Mongol]] [[Mongolian invasions of Japan|attacks on Japan]] and [[Mongolian invasion of Java|Java]] were primarily launched and a cosmopolitan center with [[Buddhism in China|Buddhist]] and [[Hinduism in China|Hindu temples]], [[Islam in China|Islamic mosques]], and [[Christianity in China|Christian churches]], including a [[Roman Catholicism in China|Catholic cathedral]] and [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] friaries. [[Ispah Rebellion|A failed revolt]] prompted a massacre of the city's foreign communities in 1357. Economic dislocations—including [[wokou|piracy]] and an [[haijin|imperial overreaction]] to it during the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]]—reduced its prosperity, with [[Sino-Japanese relations|Japanese trade]] shifting to [[Ningbo]] and [[Zhapu]] and other foreign trade restricted to [[Guangzhou]]. Quanzhou became an [[History of opium in China|opium-smuggling]] center in the 19th century but the [[siltation]] of its harbor hindered trade by larger ships.

Because of its importance for medieval maritime commerce, unique mix of religious buildings, and extensive archeological remains, "{{ill|Quanzhou: Emporium of the World in Song-Yuan China|lt=|zh|泉州：宋元中国的世界海洋商贸中心}}" was inscribed on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]] in 2021.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1561 |title = Quanzhou: Emporium of the World in Song-Yuan China |website = UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher = United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization |access-date = 22 August 2021}}</ref>

The [[Chinese Postal Map|Postal Map]] [[Chinese postal romanization|name]] of the city was "Chinchew",<ref>''[[Postal Map romanization|Postal Atlas of China]]''.</ref> an English variant of '''Chincheo''', which is also the historical [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (and later also [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[French language|French]]) name for the city. The exact etymon of the term is uncertain with multiple explanations on the matter. Historically, "Chincheo" or also "Chengchio" or "Chenchiu" was likely a name that originally referred to neighboring [[Zhangzhou]], due to the name generally being used by European sailors to denote the [[Xiamen Bay|Bay of Amoy]] and its hinterland, or even the whole [[Fujian]] province.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Van der Loon |first=Piet |date=1967 |title=The Manila Incunabula and Early Hokkien Studies, Part 2 |url=http://www2.ihp.sinica.edu.tw/file/1745sWSSKnQ.pdf |journal=Asia Major |series=New Series |language=en |volume=13 |pages=95–186}}</ref> The confusion is also discussed by [[C.

==Geography==

Quanzhou proper lies on a split of land between the estuaries of the [[Jin River (Fujian)|Jin River]] and [[Luoyang River]] as they flow into {{ill|Quanzhou Bay|zh|泉州湾}} on the [[Taiwan Strait]]. Its surrounding prefecture extends west halfway across the province and is hilly and mountainous. Along with [[Xiamen]] and [[Zhangzhou]] to its south and [[Putian]] to its north, it makes up [[Fujian]] [[provinces of China|Province]]'s Southern Coast region. In its mountainous interior, it borders [[Longyan]] to the southwest and [[Sanming]] to the northwest.

===Climate===
The city features a [[humid subtropical climate]]. Quanzhou has four distinct seasons. Its moderate temperature ranges from 0 to 38 degrees Celsius. In summer, there are [[typhoon]]s that bring rain and some damage to the city.

In the early period of the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]], Quanzhou was a part of [[Min (Ten Kingdoms)|Min]] state. After Min was destroyed by the [[Southern Tang]], the [[Qingyuan Circuit]] rose up in the original southern territory of Min. The Qingyuan Circuit was a ''[[de facto]]'' independent entity that lasted 29 years (949-978) with 4 rulers. Its territory included present-day [[Minnan region|southern Fujian]] and [[Putian]], with Quanzhou as its capital. Its founder, [[Liu Congxiao]], the Prince of Jinjiang and ''[[Jiedushi]]'' (military governor) of Qingyuan Circuit, vigorously expanded overseas trade and city development. [[Erythrina variegata|Erythrina trees]] were planted throughout Quanzhou city, so Quanzhou was called Erythrina City.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mnw.cn/wenhua/xd/1820086.html |title=留晓宏："晋江王"留从效后人，面朝开元寺春暖花开 |access-date=2019-06-08 |archive-date=2021-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210303114717/http://www.mnw.cn/wenhua/xd/1820086.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fjsq.gov.cn/frmBokkList.aspx?key=11560BE1120642B69AAE8980A4A65EC6 |title=乾德年间（963〜968年） |access-date=2020-09-26 |archive-date=2019-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223173621/http://www.fjsq.gov.cn/frmBokkList.aspx?key=11560BE1120642B69AAE8980A4A65EC6 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 964, the circuit was renamed the Pinghai Circuit.

Between 1357 and 1367 the Yisibaxi Muslim Persian garrison started the [[Ispah rebellion]] against the Yuan dynasty in Quanzhou and southern Fujian due to increasingly anti-Muslim laws.

Nawuna was killed in turn by [[Chen Youding]]. Chen began a campaign of persecution against the city's Sunni community—including massacres and grave desecration—that eventually became a three-days anti-foreign massacre. Emigrants fleeing the persecution rose to prominent positions throughout Southeast Asia, spurring the development of Islam on [[Islam in Indonesia|Java]] and elsewhere.<ref name="goff2" /> The Yuan were expelled in 1368,<ref name="midenc" /> and they turned against Pu Shougeng's family and the Muslims and slaughtered Pu Shougeng's descendants in the Ispah rebellion.

=== Ming and early Qing dynasties ===
[[File:Selden map.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Selden Map]] during the early 17th century, with Quanzhou as its trade route epicenter]]
The [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] discouraged foreign commerce other than formal [[Chinese tribute system|tributary missions]]. By 1473 trade had declined to the point that Quanzhou was no longer the headquarters of the imperial customs service for Fujian.<ref name="kamikaze" /> The [[Wokou]], who came from many different ethnicities, including Japanese, Korean, and Chinese, forced Quanzhou's Superintendency of Trade to close completely in 1522.<ref name="fopla">{{cite book |last=Nield |first=Robert |page=68 |title=China's Foreign Places: The Foreign Presence in China in the Treaty Port Era |date=March 2015 |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |isbn=9789888139286 }}</ref>

During the [[Qing dynasty]] the [[Sea Ban]] did not help the city's traders or fishermen. They were forced to abandon their access to the sea for years at a time and coastal farmers forced to relocate miles inland to inner counties like Yongchun and Anxi. Violent large scale clan fights with the thousands of non-native families from [[Guangdong]] who were deported to Quanzhou city by the Qing immediately occurred.<ref>{{cite book| title=Making Place: State Projects, Globalisation and Local Responses in China | author=Stephan Feuchtwang| date=10 September 2012 |page=41| publisher=Routledge| isbn=9781135393557}}</ref>

=== 19th century to present day ===

In the 19th century, the [[Chinese city walls|city walls]] still protected a circuit of {{convert|7|-|8|mi|sp=us}} but embraced much vacant ground.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} The bay began to attract [[Jardines']] and [[Dents']] [[History of opium in China|opium ships]] from 1832. Following the [[First Opium War]], [[Governor of Hong Kong|Governor]] [[Henry Pottinger]] proposed using Quanzhou as an official opium depot to keep the trade out of [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] and the other [[treaty port]]s but the rents sought by the imperial commissioner [[Qiying]] were too high.<ref name="fopla" />

When Chinese pirates overran the receiving ships in [[Shenhu Bay]] to capture their stockpiles of [[silver]] [[bullion]] in 1847, however, the traders moved to Quanzhou Bay regardless.<ref name="fopla" />  Around 1862, a [[Protestantism in China|Protestant]] [[Protestant missions in China|mission]] was set up in Quanzhou. As late as the middle of the century, large [[junk (ship)|Chinese junks]] could still access the town easily, trading in [[tea in China|tea]], [[sugar]], [[tobacco in China|tobacco]], [[porcelain in China|porcelain]], and [[nankeens]],{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} but [[sand bar]]s created by the rivers around the town had generally incapacitated its harbor by the [[First World War]]. It remained a large and prosperous city, but conducted its maritime trade through [[Anhai]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}

After the [[Chinese Civil War]], [[Kinmen]] became disconnected from Quanzhou with the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] successfully defended Kinmen in battle from a [[Battle of Guningtou|Communist takeover attempt]].

==Administrative divisions==
The [[prefecture-level city]] of Quanzhou administers four [[district of China|districts]], three [[county-level city|county-level cities]], four [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]], and two special economic districts. The People's Republic of China claims [[Kinmen|Kinmen Islands]] (Quemoy) (administered and also claimed by the [[Republic of China]]) as Kinmen County under the administration of Quanzhou.

===Language===
{{Main|Quanzhou dialects}}
Locals speak the Quanzhou dialect of [[Hokkien]] ([[Min Nan]]) partly the same as the [[Amoy dialect]] spoken in Xiamen, and similar to [[Singaporean Hokkien]], [[Philippine Hokkien]], and Quanzhou-descended [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]] dialects. It is unintelligible with [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]. Many overseas Chinese whose ancestors came from the Quanzhou area, especially those in Southeast Asia, often speak mainly Hokkien at home. Around the "[[Minnan region|Southern Min triangle area]]," which includes Quanzhou, [[Xiamen]] and [[Zhangzhou]], locals all speak the [[Hokkien]] language. The dialects of Hokkien itself that they speak are similar but have different tones and sometimes different pronunciation and vocabulary.

===Emigration===
[[File:宝珊 - panoramio (4).jpg|thumb|New housing developments near the city center]]
Quanzhou has been a source for [[Chinese diaspora|Chinese emigration]] to [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Taiwan]]. Some of these communities date to Quanzhou's heyday a millennium ago under the Song and Yuan dynasties.{{sfnp|Wade|2015|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gkDeCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT68 68]}} About 6 million [[overseas Chinese]] trace their ancestry to Quanzhou and Tong'an county. Most of them live in Southeast Asia, including [[Singapore]], the [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Myanmar]], and [[Thailand]].

==Economy==
[[File:Quanzhou - Sunwu Xi - DSCF8612.JPG|thumb|Quanzhou's Sunwu Creek]]

Historically Quanzhou exported [[black tea]], [[camphor]], sugar, [[indigo]], tobacco, [[ceramic]]s, cloth made of [[grass]], and minerals. As of 1832 Quanzhou imported, primarily from [[Guangzhou]], wool cloth, wine, and watches. The [[East India Company]] was exporting an estimated £150,000 a year in black tea from Quanzhou.<ref name=Roberts1>{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=Edmund |title=Embassy to the Eastern Courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat |year=1837 |publisher=Harper & Brothers |page=122 }}</ref>

Today Quanzhou is a major exporter of agricultural products such as [[tea]], [[banana]], [[lychee]], and [[rice]]. It is also a major producer of quarry [[granite]] and [[ceramic]]s. Other industries include [[textiles]], [[footwear]], [[fashion]] and [[apparel]], packaging, machinery, [[paper]] and [[petrochemicals]].<ref>Quanzhou, Fujian. InJ. R. Logan (Ed.), The new Chinese city: Globalization and market reform (pp. 227-245). Oxford: Blackwell</ref>

Its GDP ranked first in Fujian Province for 20 years from 1991 to 2010. In 2008 Quanzhou's textile and apparel production accounted for 10 percent of China's overall apparel production, stone exports account for 50 percent of Chinese stone exports, resin handicraft exports account for 70 percent of the country's total, ceramic exports account for 67 percent of the country's total, candy production accounts for 20 percent, and the production of sport and tourism shoes accounts for 80% of Chinese, and 20 percent of world production.

Quanzhou is known today as China's ''shoe city''. Quanzhou's 3,000 shoe factories produce 500 million pairs a year, making nearly one in every four pairs of sneakers made in China.

== Cars ==
Quanzhou is the biggest automotive market in Fujian. It has the highest rate of private [[automobile]] possession.<ref>KFC, McDonald's to Open Drive-in Restaurants in Quanzhou SinoCast China Business Daily News. London (UK): 23 August 2007. pg. 1</ref> Quanzhou is connected by major roads from [[Fuzhou]] to the north and [[Xiamen]] to the south.

== Transport ==

Quanzhou is an important transport hub within southeastern Fujian province. Many export industries in the Fujian interior cities will transport goods to Quanzhou ports. [[Quanzhou Port]] was one of the most prosperous port in [[Tang dynasty]] and is now still an important Chinese port for exporting.

There is a passenger ferry terminal in [[Shijing, Nan'an, Fujian]], with regular service to the Shuitou Port in the [[Taiwan|ROC]]-controlled [[Kinmen]] Island.

=== Airport ===
[[Quanzhou Jinjiang International Airport]] is Quanzhou's sole airport, served by passenger flights within mainland China and other regional/international destinations throughout southeast Asia, including Hong Kong, Macau, Manila, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok etc. Major airlines operated in JJN are Xiamen Air, Shenzhen Airlines and West Air.

=== Railway ===
The [[Zhangping–Quanzhou–Xiaocuo railway]] connects several cargo stations within Quanzhou Prefecture with the interior of Fujian and the rest of the country. Until 2014 this line also had passenger service, with fairly slow passenger trains from Beijing.

Passenger trains from China terminated at the Quanzhou East Railway Station, a few kilometers northeast of the center of the city. Passenger service on this line was terminated, and Quanzhou East railway station closed 9 December 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tiexing.com/news/2432.html |title=Quanzhou East Railway Station will stop handling passenger services |website=tiexing.com |date=2014-12-04 |access-date=2015-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910100948/http://www.tiexing.com/news/2432.html |archive-date=2015-09-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Since 2010 Quanzhou is served by the high-speed [[Fuzhou–Xiamen railway]], part of the [[Hangzhou–Fuzhou–Shenzhen high-speed railway]], which runs along China's southeastern sea coast. High-speed trains on this line stop at [[Quanzhou railway station]] (in [[Beifeng Subdistrict]] of [[Fengze District]], some 10 miles north of Quanzhou city center) and [[Jinjiang railway station]]. Trains to Xiamen take under 45 minutes, making it a convenient weekend or day trip. By 2015 direct high-speed service has become available to a number of cities in the country's interior, from Beijing to Chongqing and Guiyang.

=== Long-distance bus ===
Long-distance bus services also run daily/nightly to Shenzhen and other major cities. [[Quanzhou bus station]] operated from 1990 to 2020.
