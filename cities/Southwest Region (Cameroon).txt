The '''Southwest Region''' or '''South-West Region''' ({{Langx|fr|Région du Sud-Ouest}}) is a [[Regions of Cameroon|region]] with [[Autonomous region|special status]] in [[Cameroon]]. Its capital is [[Buea]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cvuc.cm/national/index.php/fr/carte-communale/region-du-sud/142-association/carte-administrative/sud-ouest/fako/404-buea|title=BUEA|website=cvuc.cm|language=fr-fr|access-date=2017-08-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200701060956/http://cvuc.cm/national/index.php/fr/carte-communale/region-du-sud/142-association/carte-administrative/sud-ouest/fako/404-buea |archive-date=1 July 2020 |url-status=dead}}</ref> {{As of|2015||df=}}, its population was 1,553,320. Along with the [[Northwest Region (Cameroon)|Northwest Region]], it is one of the two [[Anglophone]] (English-speaking) regions of Cameroon. Various [[Ambazonia]]n nationalist and separatist factions regard the South-West region as being distinct as a polity from Cameroon.<ref>Tatah-Mentan, I., and F. Achankeng. "Stopping war before it starts: testing preventive diplomacy in the selfdetermination case of British Southern Cameroons (aka Ambazonia)."

==History==
In 1884, the region was colonized by [[Germany]] under the [[Protectorate]] regime until 1916 when it became a [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] administered jointly by the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[France]].<ref>Emmanuel Mbah, ''Environment and Identity Politics in Colonial Africa: Fulani Migrations and Land Conflict'', Taylor & Francis, UK, 2016, p. 20</ref> In 1919, the administration of the South West region became solely British.
In 1961, the region joined Cameroon as part of the federated state of [[West Cameroon]].<ref>Emmanuel Mbah, ''Environment and Identity Politics in Colonial Africa: Fulani Migrations and Land Conflict'', Taylor & Francis, UK, 2016, p. 21</ref>

At the end of 2017, an [[Ambazonia|Ambazonian separatist]] movement in the two English-speaking regions of the [[Northwest Region (Cameroon)|North-West]] and South-West initiated a wave of violence affecting the military, police, business leaders and workers. The separatist militiamen are trying in particular to prevent children from returning to school. Between 2016 and 2019, separatists reportedly ransacked, destroyed or burned more than 174 schools<ref>Philippe Karsenty, [https://www.causeur.fr/rentree-scolaire-cameroun-ambazoniens-terrorisme-165174 in Cameroon], causeur.fr, September 2, 2019</ref> Separatists from the [[Ambazonia]] administration regard both the Northwest and Southwest regions as being constituent components of their envisaged breakaway state.<ref>Adepoju, Paul. "World Report Hospital attack in anglophone Cameroon kills four patients." (2019).</ref>

==Administration==
[[File:Map of South West CameroonAmbazonia.png|thumb|Map of Southwest]]
The region is divided into six [[division (country subdivision)|divisions]] or [[Departments of Cameroon|departments]]: [[Fako (department)|Fako]], [[Koupé-Manengouba]], [[Lebialem]], [[Manyu (department)|Manyu]], [[Meme (department)|Meme]] and [[Ndian]]. These are in turn broken down into subdivisions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cvuc.cm/sudouest/index.php/fr/carte-communale/region-du-sud-ouest/90-association/carte-administrative|title=Région du Sud-Ouest|website=cvuc.cm|language=fr-fr|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref> Presidentially appointed senior divisional officers ({{lang|fr|prefets}}) and subdivisional officers ({{lang|fr|sous-prefets}}) govern each respectively.

===Special status===
As part of the [[Major National Dialogue]], the region was given a "special status" in December 2019, granting additional rights and responsibilities in relation to economic, health, social, educational, sports and cultural development.<ref>https://www.reuters.com/article/world/cameroon-grants-special-status-to-anglophone-regions-idUSKBN1YO24I/</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-12-21 |title=Cameroon MPs Approve Law Giving Special Status to English-Speaking Regions |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/africa_cameroon-mps-approve-law-giving-special-status-english-speaking-regions/6181455.html |access-date=2024-10-08 |website=Voice of America |language=en}}</ref> Under the special status the region has a bicameral Regional Assembly, made up of a 20-member House of Chiefs composed of traditional leaders and a 70-member House of Divisional Representatives nominated by municipal councils. The Regional Assembly appoints a Regional Executive Council.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=2020-11-25 |title=Comprendre la Région CTDEN |url=https://www.minddevel.gov.cm/comprendre-la-region-ctden/ |access-date=2024-10-08 |website=Ministère de la Décentralisation et du Devellopement Local |language=fr-FR}}</ref> Additional powers over health and education were also granted to municipalities.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bone |first=R.

====Regional Executive Council====
The Regional Executive Council is led by the President of the Regional Assembly and includes a vice president, three commissioners, two secretaries and a questor.<ref name=":0" /> The first committee, elected in December 2020, was as follows:<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-12-22 |title=Cameroon: First-Ever South West Regional Council Session Takes Place - PAN AFRICAN VISIONS |url=https://panafricanvisions.com/2020/12/cameroon-first-ever-south-west-regional-council-session-takes-place/ |access-date=2024-10-08 |website=panafricanvisions.com |language=en}}</ref>

==Geography==
The region was notable for having the first English-speaking university in Cameroon (the University of Buea).
Towns include the capital [[Buea]], [[Limbe, Cameroon|Limbe]], [[Tiko]], [[Kumba]] and [[Mamfe]]. Limbe in particular is a popular tourist resort notable for its fine beaches. [[Korup National Park]] is also a major attraction. Buea itself, meanwhile, sits at the foot of [[Mount Cameroon]], and possesses an almost temperate climate markedly different from the rest of the province.
