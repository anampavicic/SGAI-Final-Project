'''Dawei<ref name="BNI-20190712" />''' ({{MYname|MY=ထားဝယ်|MLCTS=hta: wai}}, {{IPA-my|dəwɛ̀|pron}}; {{langx|mnw|ဓဝဲါ}}, {{IPA-mnw|həwài|pron}}; {{langx|th|ทวาย}}, [[Royal Thai General System of Transcription|RTGS:]] ''Thawai'', {{IPA|th|tʰā.wāːj|pron}}; formerly known as '''Tavoy''') is a city in south-eastern [[Myanmar]] and is the capital of the [[Tanintharyi Region]], formerly known as the Tenasserim Division, on the eastern bank of the [[Dawei River]]. The city is about {{convert|614.3|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Yangon]]. Its population (2014 estimate) is 146,964. Dawei is a port at the head of the Dawei River [[estuary]], {{convert|30|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}. from the [[Andaman Sea]]. As a result, the city is prone to flooding during the monsoon season. [[Dawei People]] is also the name of one of Myanmar's 135 ethnic minorities.

==Etymology==
''Dawei'' derives from the [[Mon language]] term ''hawai'' ({{langx|mnw|ထဝဲါ}}; {{IPA|/həwai/}}), which means 'to sit cross-legged', in reference to the Buddha's sitting posture on the [[palin (throne)]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tun|first=Than|date=1988|title=Observations on the Translation and Annotation of the Royal Orders Of Burma|journal=Crossroads: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Southeast Asian Studies|volume=4|issue=1|pages=91–99|jstor=40860260}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://burmese.phophtawnews.org/index.php/feature/item/852-2013-11-07-04-04-57.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626130840/http://burmese.phophtawnews.org/index.php/feature/item/852-2013-11-07-04-04-57.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=26 June 2015|title=မွန်တို့ဌာနေ ရာမည တိုင်းက မွန် အခေါ်အဝေါ်များ|last=Banyar|first=Ko|date=7 November 2013|website=Phophtaw News Association}}</ref>

==History==
The area around the Dawei River estuary has been inhabited for centuries by [[Dawei (ethinc group)|Dawei]], [[Mon (ethnic group)|Mon]], [[Karen people|Kayin]], and [[Thai (ethnic group)|Thai]] mariners.

As the ancient site, Sagara City, old Dawei, which is approximately 6 miles north of the present city, has so many traces of [[Pyu city-states|Pyu]] culture, it was recognized as one of the province capitals in the ancient Pyu era. The evidence of burial urns, beads, coins and other features of Pyu culture have been excavated in the area by the Department of Archaeology and National Museum, Myanmar.

From the 11th to the 13th centuries, Dawei was part of the [[Pagan Empire]]. From 1287 to 1564, Dawei became part of the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] and its successor, the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] (Siam). From 1564 to 1594, Dawei was part of the [[Toungoo dynasty|Toungoo Kingdom]] of Burma. Siam [[Burmese–Siamese War (1594–1605)|temporarily regained the city]] between 1594 and 1614. From 1614 to the 1740s, Dawei was the southernmost city under Burmese authority and was defended by a Burmese garrison. In the late 1740s, during the Burmese civil war of 1740–1757, Dawei, along with the northern Tenasserim coast, was taken over by Siam. Burma [[Burmese–Siamese War (1759–1760)|regained the city]] in 1760 and [[Burmese–Siamese War (1765–1767)|extended its control over the entire Tenasserim coast]], in 1765. The Tenasserim coast was ceded to the [[British Empire|British]] after the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] (1824–1826).

After independence in 1948, the city became part of the [[Tanintharyi Region|Tenasserim Division]], which also included today's [[Mon State]]. In 1974, Mon State was carved out of Tenasserim and Dawei became the capital of the truncated division. In 1989, the city's English name was changed from Tavoy to Dawei, and Tenasserim became Tanintharyi.

==Climate==
Dawei features an extreme [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Am''), similar to [[Sittwe]] further north-west. There is a substantial dry season from November to March, but in the wet season the influence of local mountains causes Dawei to receive as much as {{convert|1300|mm|in|}} precipitation per month. Apart from [[El Chocó|the Chocó region]] of Colombia, and the area around [[Mount Cameroon]] in Africa, it is possibly the wettest lowland tropical region in the world.

===Dawei Airport===

The airport serves as the domestic airport for the city of Dawei and the neighbouring towns. The government plans to upgrade the airport to serve as a hub for tourism.

===Dawei Railway Station===

It is the southernmost station and terminus in Myanmar. However the railway was partly constructed for a further 40 km approximately to the south towards Min Dat bridge and south Myanmar. Work ceased on this line in about 2012 but several partly constructed sections with bridges over rivers are visible on Google Earth.
