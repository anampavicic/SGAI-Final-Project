'''San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca''' ({{IPA|es-419|saɱ feɾˈnando ðel ˈβaʝe ðe kataˈmaɾka|lang}})  is the capital and largest city in [[Catamarca Province]] in [[Argentine Northwest|northwestern]] [[Argentina]], on the [[Río Valle]] River, at the feet of the [[Cerro Ambato]]. The city name is normally shortened as '''Catamarca''' and is also known as '''Ciudad de Catamarca'''.

The city of {{convert|684|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, located {{convert|500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, has 159,000 inhabitants ({{census-ar|2010}}), with more than 200,000 counting the suburbia, which represents around 70% of the population of the province.

== Overview ==
The city is located {{convert|1130|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from [[Buenos Aires]]. The closest provincial capitals are [[La Rioja, Argentina|La Rioja]] ({{convert|154|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}), [[San Miguel de Tucumán|Tucumán]] ({{convert|230|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}) and [[Santiago del Estero]] ({{convert|209|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}).

Many [[pilgrim]]s come to San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca to visit the Church of the Virgin of the Valley (1694), which contains a statue of ''Nuestra Señora'' del Valle (Our Lady of the Valley).

Catamarca is also the touristic centre of the province, with its [[colonial architecture]], and serves as a hub to many touristic points and excursions, hiking, mountain-bike tours, horse riding, and wine tasting.

== Transportation ==
San Fernando del Valle is served by [[Coronel Felipe Varela International Airport]] (CTC/SANC), with flights to Buenos Aires-AEP.

==History and politics==
An initial settlement, called Londres, was established here by [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonists]] in 1558; a permanent settlement was not founded until 1683, by [[Fernando de Mendoza y Mate de Luna]]. ''Catamarca'' comes from [[Quechua language|Quechua]], meaning "fortress on the slope".

The city, which had only 8,000 inhabitants in 1882 and was reached by a [[Rail transport in Argentina|railway line]] in 1888, grew very slowly, and the region remained poor even in the middle of the 20th century.

== Climate ==
The warm [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSh'') of Catamarca has an annual average of 20&nbsp;°C with an average maximum temperature of {{convert|34|C|F|0}} in summer with several days typically exceeding {{convert|43|C|F|0}}, and an average minimum of {{convert|5|C|F}} in winter. Temperatures in the high mountains can drop down to {{convert|&minus;30|C|F}}, however in the city they rarely go below freezing. The Valle (valley) receives relatively little rainfall from summer thunderstorms; most of the precipitation is received in the form of snow on the high mountain tops surrounding the city.
