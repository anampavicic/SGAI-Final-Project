== Etymology ==
In ancient times, the town was known as "city of [[Mediomatrici]]", being inhabited by the tribe of the same name.<ref name="etymology">Martin P. (2010) ''Metz, 2000 years of history.'' Eds. Serpenoise. {{ISBN|978-2-87692-845-9}} pp.&nbsp;8–9</ref> After its integration into the [[Roman Empire]], the city was called ''Divodurum Mediomatricum'', meaning Holy Village or Holy Fortress of the Mediomatrici,<ref>Toussaint M. (1948) Metz à l'époque gallo-romaine. Eds. Impr. P. Even. pp.&nbsp;21–22 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> then it was known as ''Mediomatrix''.<ref name="etymology" /> During the 5th century AD, the name evolved to "Mettis", which gave rise to the current spelling, Metz,<ref name="etymology" /> but also spellings such as ''Mès'', which are no longer used, but reflect its actual pronunciation in French (like "mess").<ref name="Cent Nouvelles nouvelles">{{cite book |orig-date=1462 |location=France |date=1868 |publisher=Pierre Jannet |title=Cent Nouvelles nouvelles (Nouvelle 92)}}.</ref>

[[File:Henri2entranceMetz.jpg|thumb|[[Henry II of France]] entering Metz in 1552, putting an end to the Republic of Metz.]]
Metz has a recorded history dating back over 2,000 years. Before the [[Gallic Wars|conquest of Gaul]] by [[Julius Caesar]] in 52 BC, it was the [[oppidum]] of the [[Celt]]ic [[Mediomatrici]] tribe.<ref name="history" /> Integrated into the [[Roman Empire]], Metz became quickly one of the principal towns of [[Gaul]] with a population of 40,000,<ref name="Divodurum" /> until the [[migration period|barbarian]] [[raid (military)|depredations]] and its transfer to the [[Franks]] about the end of the 5th century.<ref name="history" /><ref>Di Rocco A.

With the signature of the [[Treaty of Chambord]] in 1552, Metz passed into the hands of the [[Kingdom of France|Kings of France]].<ref name="history" /><ref>Brasme P. (2011) Quand Metz reçoit la France. Eds. des Paraiges. {{ISBN|979-10-90185-03-6}} pp.&nbsp;17–34 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> As the German Protestant Princes who traded Metz (alongside Toul and Verdun) for the promise of French military assistance, had no authority to cede territory of the Holy Roman Empire, the change of jurisdiction was not recognised by the Holy Roman Empire until the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] in 1648. Under French rule, Metz was selected as capital of the [[Three Bishoprics]] and became a strategic fortified town.<ref name="history" /><ref name="republic2">Vigneron B.

Although largely French-speaking, after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and under the [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt of 1871]] the city became part of the [[German Empire]], being part of the Imperial Territory of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] and serving as capital of the [[Bezirk Lothringen]].<ref>Roth F. (2011) La Lorraine Annexée – version 2011, nouvelle édition. Eds. Serpenoise. {{ISBN|978-2-87692-866-4}} {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

=== Population ===
The inhabitants of Metz are called ''Messin(e)s''. Statistics on the ethnic and religious make up of the population of Metz are haphazard, as the [[French Fifth Republic|French Republic]] prohibits making distinctions between citizens regarding race, beliefs, and political and philosophic opinions in the process of census taking.<ref>A law from 1872 forbids the collection by the state of census data based on questions about religious beliefs. The [[French Third Republic]] considered that kind of information to be private and that any citizen of the Republic should be considered as equal of his mates, regardless his provocative and potentially [[wikt:Special:Search/divisive|divisive]]{{clarify|date=April 2019}}. In accordance with the concept of [[laïcité]], this principle was reaffirmed by the current [[French Fifth Republic]] in a law from 1978, stating that "it is forbidden to collect or process data of a personal nature related to racial or ethnic origins as well as political, philosophic, or religious opinions."</ref>

The French national [[census]] of 2018 estimated the population of Metz to be 116,581, while the population of Metz [[functional area (France)|metropolitan area]] was about 368,000.<ref name=compar>{{cite web |url=https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/1405599?geo=AAV2020-033+UU2020-57701+COM-57463 |title=Comparateur de territoire: Aire d'attraction des villes 2020 de Metz (033), Unité urbaine 2020 de Metz (57701), Commune de Metz (57463) |access-date=20 June 2022 |publisher=[[INSEE]] |language=fr}}</ref> Through history, Metz's population has been affected by the vicissitudes of the wars and annexations involving the city, which have prevented continuous population growth.

=== Notable people ===
{{Main|List of people from Metz}}
Several well-known figures have been linked to the city of Metz throughout its history. Renowned ''Messins'' include poet [[Paul Verlaine]],<ref name="Verlaine">{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xskq5v_la-maison-de-verlaine-clip-2012_creation#.UUtxixnmvH0 |title=Verlaine's native house – House of Verlaine (museum), video clip. |date=2 August 2012 |access-date=21 March 2013 |language=fr}}</ref> composer [[Ambroise Thomas]] and mathematician [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]]; numerous well-known German figures were also born in Metz notably during the annexation periods. Moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer [[François Rabelais]], [[Cardinal Mazarin]], political thinker [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], artist and the inventor of the motion picture camera [[Louis Le Prince]], French patriot and American Revolutionary War hero Marquis [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette]], and Luxembourg-born German-French statesman [[Robert Schuman]].

== Law and government ==

=== Local law ===
{{Main|Local law in Alsace-Moselle}}
The ''local law'' ({{Langx|fr|droit local}}) applied in Metz is a legal system that operates in parallel with [[French law]]. Created in 1919, it preserves the French laws applied in France before 1870 and maintained by the Germans during the annexation of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], but repealed in the rest of France after 1871. It also maintains German laws enacted by the [[German Empire]] between 1871 and 1918, specific provisions adopted by the local authorities, and French laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in [[Alsace-Lorraine]]. This specific local legislation encompasses different areas including religion, social work and finance.

The most striking of the legal differences between France and [[Alsace-Lorraine]] is the absence in Alsace-Lorraine of strict [[secularism]], even though a constitutional right of [[freedom of religion]] is guaranteed by the French government. Alsace-Lorraine is still governed by a pre-[[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|1905 law]] established by the [[Concordat of 1801]], which provides for the public subsidy of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Lutheran Church|Lutheran]] and [[Calvinist Church|Calvinist]] churches and the [[Judaism|Jewish]] religion.

=== Administration ===

=== Metz in the arts ===
Metz was an important cultural centre during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]].<ref name="GregorianChant" /> For instance, [[Gregorian chant]] was created in Metz during the 8th century as a fusion of Gallican and ancient Roman repertory. Then called Messin Chant, it remains the oldest form of music still in use in Western Europe. The bishops of Metz, notably [[Chrodegang of Metz|Saint-Chrodegang]] promoted its use for the Roman liturgy in Gallic lands under the favorable influence of the Carolingian monarchs. Messin chant made two major contributions to the body of chant: it fitted the chant into the ancient Greek [[octoechos]] system, and invented an innovative [[musical notation]], using [[neume]]s to show the shape of a remembered melody.<ref>Grier J. (2003) Ademar de Chabannes, Carolingian Musical Practices, and Nota Romana. Journal of the American Musicological Society. 56 (1):43–98.</ref> Metz was also an important centre of [[Illuminated manuscripts|illumination]] of [[Carolingian art#Illuminated manuscripts|Carolingian manuscripts]], producing such monuments of Carolingian book illumination as the [[Drogo Sacramentary]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bm.mairie-metz.fr/clientbookline/home.asp |title=Official Metz library website, medieval book webpage. |access-date=1 July 2012 |language=fr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621014656/http://bm.mairie-metz.fr/clientbookline/home.asp |archive-date=21 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://bm.mairie-metz.fr/sitebm/commun/patrimoine/galerie%20Vy/index-heures.html |title=Official Metz library website, Book of Hours of John of Vy. |access-date=1 July 2012 |language=fr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114103409/http://bm.mairie-metz.fr/sitebm/commun/patrimoine/galerie%20Vy/index-heures.html |archive-date=14 January 2012}}</ref>
