The village of [[Kafr Saba]] was considered to be ancient Capharsaba, an important settlement during the [[Second Temple period]] in ancient Judea.<ref name="hist">[http://www.kfar-saba.muni.il/htmls/english/history_english.html The Origin of the Name Capharsaba] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523091104/http://www.kfar-saba.muni.il/htmls/english/history_english.html |date=2008-05-23 }} Kfar Sava Municipal Council</ref><ref name="ariel">{{cite encyclopedia|year=1976|title=Kefar-Sava|encyclopedia=Ariel Encyclopedia|publisher=Am Oved|location=Israel|last=Vilnai|first=Ze'ev|volume=4|pages=3790–96|language=he}}</ref> It is mentioned for the first time in the writings of [[Josephus]], in his account of the attempt of [[Alexander Jannaeus]] to halt an invasion from the north led by [[Antiochus XII Dionysus|Antiochus]],<ref>(Antiquities, book 13, chapter 15)</ref> appears in the [[Talmud]] in connection to corn tithing and the Capharsaba [[sycamore fig]] tree.<ref name="hist" />

===Beginnings (1898–1913)===
The Jewish [[moshav|moshava]] of Kfar Saba was established in 1898, following the purchase of land from the Arab village of the same name. Acquiring 7,500 [[dunams]] (equivalent to 1,668 acres in [[Ottoman Palestine]], where a dunam equals 900 square meters), the endeavor faced initial challenges: the land was desolate, neglected, and distant from other Jewish settlements. <ref>{{cite news |last=Hoffman |first=Carl |title=Pride and preservation |date=June 17, 2009 |url=https://www.jpost.com/Local-Israel/Tel-Aviv-And-Center/Pride-and-preservation |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref> Furthermore, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[pasha]] of [[Nablus]], to whose governorate the land belonged, refused to give building permits, forcing the first settlers to live in huts made of clay and straw. They earned their living by growing [[almonds]], [[grapes]] and [[olives]]. It was located approximately 3&nbsp;km to the west of the Arab village of [[Kafr Saba]], after which it was named. Despite attractive advertisements in Jerusalem and London, initial attempts to sell plots to private individuals were unsuccessful.<ref name="ariel" /> Starting in 1903, Jewish workers resided on the site of Kfar Saba.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marom|first=Roy|date=2021-06-09|title=The Abu Hameds of Mulabbis: an oral history of a Palestinian village depopulated in the Late Ottoman period|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/13530194.2021.1934817|journal=British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies|volume=48|issue=2|pages=87–106|doi=10.1080/13530194.2021.1934817|s2cid=236222143|issn=1353-0194}}</ref> A well was dug in 1906. Most of the manual laborers on the land were peasants from [[Qalqilya]].<ref name="ariel" /> 

In 1910, an Arab guard employed by Jewish landowners shot at a group of Arab almond thieves from Qalqilya, killing one. An Arab mob then descended on Kfar Saba, beating residents, breaking and looting equipment, and taking two Jewish guards prisoner.<ref>{{cite news |script-title=he:מכתב מפתח תקוה |language=he |trans-title=Letter from Petah Tikvah |last=Kashran |first=Tzvi |newspaper=[[Hapoel Hatzair]] |url=http://jpress.org.il/Olive/APA/NLI_Heb/SharedView.Article.aspx?parm=FamqmcXE%2Fl2ac0e5IhOxmdsx8F9b%2BCL9bnQrIY7IjWJPxKWkYqYexl92NcMlhPJtYw%3D%3D&mode=image&href=HHR%2f1910%2f08%2f12&page=18&rtl=true |date=August 12, 1910 |access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Ben-Yishai |first=Ron |script-title=he:לזכרו של ברוך פריבר |language=he |trans-title=Remembering Baruch Freever |url=http://jpress.org.il/Olive/APA/NLI_Heb/SharedView.Article.aspx?parm=ugUEaW49tUfUEMYQLCF0klo7TXu6SfuFFP6eG2%2Fy6C6kBjk7bUcIYIjBoy01%2B1zSYw%3D%3D&mode=image&href=DAV%2f1983%2f03%2f21&page=15&rtl=true |date=March 21, 1983 |access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref> The situation was defused when reinforcements from Petah Tikva arrived, and a peace was negotiated. This attack drew widespread public attention among Jews in Palestine and around the world, and it was subsequently decided to turn Kfar Saba into a permanent settlement, even without building permits. In 1912, the construction of twelve single-story permanent houses began along a route that is now Herzl Street. The houses were camouflaged due to the lack of building permits. Construction was finished in 1913.<ref name="hebrew">{{Cite web | url=http://www.kfar-saba.muni.il/?CategoryID=312 |title = היסטוריה}}</ref>[[File:כפר סבא - ה"חאן הראשון"-JNF023690.jpeg|thumb|Kfar Saba 1913]]

===World War I===
When [[World War I]] broke out in 1914, the Ottoman authorities harassed the residents, confiscating work animals and crops. The [[1915 Palestine locust infestation]] destroyed vegetation in the area. Before Kfar Saba had fully recovered, about a thousand Jewish refugees of the [[Tel Aviv and Jaffa deportation]] who were seeking shelter arrived. The town's few houses could not accommodate the large number of refugees, and many died due to the harsh sanitary conditions.<ref name=hebrew/>

In the [[Palestine Campaign]] of the war, Kfar Saba was on the front line between British General [[Edmund Allenby]]'s [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force|Egypt Expeditionary Force]] and the Ottoman Army for almost a year, and by the time of the British victory in September 1918, it had been destroyed.<ref name=hebrew/>

===British Mandate=== 
Following Kfar Saba's destruction in World War I, residents began rebuilding the town. During the [[1921 Jaffa riots]], Kfar Saba, then a small and isolated town, was evacuated on orders of the [[Haganah]]. It was attacked during the riots. In May 1921 the original residents returned and found their homes had been looted and burned. They began to rebuild the town for a third time, and it slowly recovered. In 1924 additional settlers joined Kfar Saba. In this period the moshava began to redevelop as cultivation of citrus fruit began, replacing almonds. The first elections for the local council were held.<ref>[http://www.kfar-saba.muni.il/?CategoryID=312 History] Kfar Saba Municipal Council {{in lang|he}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

In August 1947, a Jewish man was found shot to death outside the town.<ref>[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1947/08/16/87806964.html?pageNumber=1 Haganah Kills 11 in Palestine Hunt for Arab Gunmen] ''New York Times'', August 16, 1947</ref>

===1947–48 war===
In December 1947, as the [[1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine|civil war]] between the Arab and Jewish communities got underway, leaders of both sides in the area pledged to keep the peace between the local communities.<ref>[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1947/12/25/87567080.html?pageNumber=4 6 Dead, 26 Injured in Haifa Fighting] NY Times, December 25, 1947</ref> In the following months, Kfar Saba was attacked by local Arab militia from the nearby Arab village of Kafr Saba. The [[Arab Liberation Army]] (ALA), an outfit consisting of volunteers from several neighboring Arab countries, sent troops to aid in these attacks.<ref>{{cite book |last=Morris |first=Benny |author-link=Benny Morris |title=1948: A History of the First Arab-Israeli War |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |location=[[New Haven, Connecticut]] |page=164 |year=2008 |isbn=9780300126969 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5jtAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> 

The village was depopulated of its Arab residents by [[Jewish]] forces on May 13, 1948, one day before the new [[Declaration of independence (Israel)|State of Israel was declared]].<ref>Benvenisti, 2002, p.

===State of Israel===
[[File:ArcheologyPark4852.jpg|thumb|Archeological Garden on the remains of the Palestinian village of [[Kafr Saba]].]]

In May 1948, when Israeli independence was declared, Kfar Saba had a population of approximately 5,500. Following the war, it rapidly expanded as many Jewish [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim lands|immigrants from Arab and Muslim countries]] settled there, and new housing projects were built to accommodate them. The town found itself at the narrowest point of Israeli territory, with just 14 km from the sea to the [[West Bank]] village of [[Qalqilya]]. It expanded over the depopulated<ref>Benvenisti, 2002, p. [https://archive.org/details/sacredlandscapeb00benvrich/page/n302 273]</ref><ref>Morris, 2004, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=uM_kFX6edX8C&pg=PA246 246]-247</ref> Arab village of [[Kafr Saba]], the site of which is today located in the Shikun Kaplan area of the city. As it became obvious that agriculture alone could not support the economy, an industrial zone was established. In 1953, the population was about 15,000. [[Meir Hospital]] was opened in 1956.<ref name=Surkis />

The rapid growth of the town meant that its status as a moshava was outdated, and it was granted city status in 1962, with head of the local council, [[Mordechai Surkis]], becoming its first mayor.<ref name=Surkis>[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mk_eng.asp?mk_individual_id_t=538 Mordechai Surkis: Public Activities] Knesset website</ref> The city had a population of 19,000 at the time. After receiving its city status, a court, a police branch, and offices of the [[Bituah Leumi|National Insurance Institute]] and the Israel Tax Authority were established in Kfar Saba. Agriculture also continued to decline in importance in the city's economy as new factories were built. Despite this, the city still had thousands of acres of orchards in the late 1960s.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

During the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, two neighborhoods in Kfar Saba were shelled by Jordanian artillery, and an attack on a factory by Jordanian warplanes killed four workers. Following the war, the population increased as many people moved to Kfar Saba from the [[Gush Dan]] area, and during [[1970s Soviet Union aliyah|Soviet-Jewish immigration]] to Israel in the early 1970s, the city took in many Soviet immigrants and established an immigrant absorption center. In 1977, Kfar Saba had a population of 35,000.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

====First and Second Intifada====
Kfar Saba is located just across the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]] from the Palestinian city of [[Qalqilya]]. During times of relative peace, residents of Kfar Saba would shop in Qalqilya: this practice ended at the start of the [[First Intifada]] in 1987. In the following years, Kfar Saba became a frequent target of [[Palestinian political violence|Palestinian terror attacks]]. In April 2001, a Palestinian [[suicide bomber]] wearing an explosive belt killed a doctor and wounded 50 at a bus stop in Kfar Saba.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.jweekly.com/2001/05/04/israeli-yuppie-town-of-kfar-saba-now-finding-itself-on-the-front-line-of-th/ |title=Israeli yuppie town of Kfar Saba now finding itself on the front line of the battle with the Palesti |agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |author=Jessica Steinberg |date=2001-05-04 |publisher=JWeekly.com |access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref> In March 2002, a Palestinian opened fire on passersby at a major intersection, killing an Israeli girl and wounding 16 before being shot dead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.israelinsider.com/channels/security/articles/sec_0220.htm |title=security: Suicide attacks in Kfar Saba and Jerusalem kill one Israeli |publisher=israelinsider |date=2002-03-17 |access-date=2009-05-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125135604/http://israelinsider.com/channels/security/articles/sec_0220.htm |archive-date=2010-11-25 }}</ref> In April 2003, a Palestinian suicide bomber blew himself up at the Kfar Saba train station during the morning rush hour, killing a security guard and wounding 10 bystanders.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/guard-killed-and-10-hurt-in-israel-suicide-attack-116465.html |title=Guard killed and 10 hurt in Israel suicide attack |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=April 24, 2003 |access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref>

A [[Mamluk]] [[caravanserai]] complex, including the mausoleum of Nabi Yamin, is located by the Kfar Saba – [[Qalqilyah]] road. The site contains an inscription dated to the 14th century.<ref>{{in lang|he}}Yoav Regev (יואב רגב), ed., '''The New Israel Guide''' (מדריך ישראל החדש), vol. 8, p. 94, 2001.</ref> The site has been associated with the tomb of [[Benjamin]], son of Jacob.<ref name="VermeulenSteenbergen2001">{{cite book|last1=Vermeulen|first1=Urbain|last2=Steenbergen|first2=J. van|title=Egypt and Syria in the Fatimid, Ayyubid, and Mamluk Eras III: Proceedings of the 6th, 7th and 8th International Colloquium Organized at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in May 1997, 1998, and 1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8A4uJ1z-zx8C&pg=PA366|access-date=18 February 2014|year=2001|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=9789042909700|pages=366–}}</ref> North of this complex is a smaller tomb whose cupola has been painted green and is being maintained by local Palestinian Muslims, who consider it the "real" tomb. Jews and Muslims venerate Benjamin. Kfar Saba is in the heart of Dan's tribal area, but there are traditions that explain why Benjamin's tomb is located in the land of the tribe of Dan. The traditional burial place of [[Simeon (Hebrew Bible)|Simeon]], son of Jacob, lies close to Kfar Saba. It is a small domed structure that sits in a field not far from kibbutz [[Eyal]]. According to [[Meron Benvenisti]], the site was until 1948 only holy to Muslims, and Jews ascribed no holiness to it.<ref>Benvenisti, 2002, p.

===First well===
The modern development of Kfar Saba started when water was discovered in the early 1920s. The first well was excavated at this time, followed by many others over the next two decades. The Kfar Saba Water Plant was founded to centralize the water supply system. The city's first well is located in the courtyard of Kfar Saba City Hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.water-tower.co.il/en/about-water-tower/|title=The Kfar Saba water tower|publisher=Water-tower.co.il|date=2011-11-29|access-date=2014-02-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426062703/http://www.water-tower.co.il/en/about-water-tower/|archive-date=2012-04-26|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Amrami's dairy farm===
The site of the dairy farm of Baruch Amrami, who transferred the administration of the Kfar Saba settlement from [[Petah Tikva]] to a local committee and founded the water company and the first bank of the village in the 1920s, is on the corner of Amrami and Rothschild Streets. The cowshed and Amrami's "office" are still standing.<ref name=deutch>{{cite news|last=Deutch |first=Gloria |title=Streetwise: Rehov Amrami, Kfar Saba |work=The Jerusalem Post |access-date=2009-03-04 |date=2008-01-03 |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1198517283103&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130706010509/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1198517283103&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-07-06 }}</ref>

===Nordenstein house===
Due to the lack of security during World War I, the settlement was abandoned. In 1922, the Nordenstein family returned and built the first defensible stone house. It took another two years for other families to return (mostly from Petah Tikva). The Nordenstein House is still standing on HaEmek Street, near the central bus station.{{citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Kibbutz HaKovesh dining hall===
A stone house on [[Tel Hai]] Street designed for defense (outlooks and sharp-shooting parapets) served as the communal dining room of Kibbutz HaKovesh. The pioneers themselves lived in tents. In 1948, the kibbutz moved north to secure the Kalkiliya front. The building now houses the Kfar Saba Civil Guard.{{citation needed|date=March 2009}}

[[File:רחוב תל חי.jpg|thumb|Tel Hay street. There is considerable use of tiled roofs]]

== Architecture ==
Kfar Saba is characterized by residential buildings with red tiled roofs. The use of red tiled roofs is evident in all types of buildings: private homes, high-rise buildings, businesses and industry. There is a widespread use of porches with arches, especially in front of the stores at Weizmann and Rothschild streets.

In 2014, the Kfar Saba Municipality decided to oblige every [[Contractor management|contractor]] who wants to build in the city area to install "green roofs." The meaning of green roofs is that [[solar panel]]s will be installed on the roof to generate electricity from solar energy or a [[Kitchen garden|vegetable garden]] will be planted.<ref>{{Cite web|title=גגות ירוקים|url=https://www.kfar-saba.muni.il/?CategoryID=3096|access-date=2020-11-19|website=www.kfar-saba.muni.il}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=לוי|first=דותן|date=2014-01-29|title=רוצים היתר בנייה בכפר סבא? גדלו גינת ירק על הגג|url=https://www.calcalist.co.il/real_estate/articles/0,7340,L-3622880,00.html|access-date=2020-11-19|website=כלכליסט - www.calcalist.co.il}}</ref>
