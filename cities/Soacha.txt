'''Soacha''' is an autonomous municipality of the [[Departments of Colombia|department]] of [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] in [[Colombia]], and part of the [[Metropolitan Area of Bogotá]]. It has an important industrial zone and is home to mostly working-class families. Soacha borders [[Bojacá]] and [[Mosquera]] to the north, [[Sibaté]] and [[Pasca]] to the south, to the east the capital Bogotá and to the west [[Granada, Cundinamarca|Granada]] and [[San Antonio del Tequendama]].

== Demographics ==
With a population of 778,400 (2023 projection),<ref>[http://www.citypopulation.de/en/colombia/cities/ Citypopulation.de] Population of the major cities in Colombia</ref> it is the biggest city in Cundinamarca and one of the biggest in Colombia.

== Etymology ==
The name Soacha is derived from the [[Chibcha language|Chibcha]] words ''Súa'', name of Sun god [[Sué]], and ''chá'' which means "man"; "Man of the Sun". The original name ''Suecha'' has been changed to Soacha over time.<ref name=websiteSoacha>{{in lang|es}} [http://www.soacha-cundinamarca.gov.co/index.shtml Official website Soacha]</ref>

== History ==
Soacha was inhabited first by indigenous groups during the [[Herrera Period]] and later became an important village in the [[Muisca Confederation]], the former country of the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] before the arrival of the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s. The ''[[zipa]]'' of Bacatá (now known as Bogotá) ruled over Soacha.

Modern Soacha was founded on 15 August 1600. It gained national notoriety after the [[President of Colombia|presidential candidate]] [[Luis Carlos Galán]] was assassinated on August 18, 1989, while visiting the city during his presidential campaign.

Also during 1989, the bombing of [[Avianca Flight 203]] happened in Soacha, killing everyone on-board plus three Soacha residents. The bombing was planned by [[Cartel de Medellin]] leader [[Pablo Escobar]], who intended to murder presidential candidate [[César Gaviria]], who was supposed to be on board. Gaviria had decided not to fly and instead went on to become President of Colombia.
 
In 2008, the [['false positives' scandal]] broke when 22 men from Soacha who had been recruited for work were found dead several hundreds of miles away. They had been killed by the military and presented to authorities as guerrilla fighters (insurgents) killed in battle, in order to increase action head counts. Similar cases have since appeared all over the country.<ref name=lat>{{cite news|title=In Colombia, 6 sentenced in 'false positives' death scheme|date=June 14, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|url=https://www.latimes.com/world/la-xpm-2012-jun-14-la-fg-colombia-false-positives-20120614-story.html}}</ref>
