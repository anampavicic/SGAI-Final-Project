At more 2,500 years in age,  Andijan is the oldest city in Uzbekistan<ref> https://uzbekistan.travel/en/o/a-facecard-of-andijan-devonaboy-mosque/ Retrieved at 11.51 on Friday 17/5/24.</ref> and one of the oldest cities in the Fergana Valley. In some parts of the city, archeologists have found items dating back to the 7th and 8th centuries [[Common Era|B.C.E.]] Historically, Andijan was an important city on the [[Silk Road]]. 

The city is perhaps best known as the birthplace of [[Babur]] who, following a series of setbacks, finally succeeded in laying the basis for the [[Mughal dynasty]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]] and became the first Mughal emperor. Andijan also gained notoriety in 2005 when government forces opened fire on protestors, killing hundreds in what came to be known as the [[2005 Andijan Massacre|Andijan Massacre]].

Andijan was developed into an important industrial city during the [[Soviet]] era. Manufactured goods produced in the city include [[Chemical substance|chemicals]], [[Major appliance|domestic appliance]]s, [[electronics]], [[food]]stuffs, [[furniture]], [[Plough|plow]]s, [[pump]]s, [[shoe]]s, spare parts for farming machines, various engineering tools, and [[wheelchair]]s.

Andijan experiences frequent seismic activity and was destroyed by a [[1902 Andijan earthquake|large earthquake in 1902]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Andijon|title=Andijon &#124; Andijon &#124; Uzbekistan, Silk Road, Fergana Valley &#124; Britannica|website=www.britannica.com}}</ref> This was the worst earthquake to occur in Uzbekistan in the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/ar/911881493877940126/pdf/114768-WP-PUBLIC-drp-uzbekistan.pdf |website=World Bank |title=Europe and Central Asia Risk Profiles}}</ref>

==History==

=== Toponymy ===
The origin of the name of the city is uncertain. Arab geographers of the 10th century referred to Andijan as "Andukan," "Andugan," or "Andigan."<ref>{{cite book|last=Pospelov|first=E.

=== Early history ===

The city is perhaps best known as the birthplace of [[Babur]] who, following a series of setbacks, finally succeeded in laying the basis for the [[Mughal dynasty]] in the [[Indian Subcontinent]] and became the first Mughal emperor.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Manz|first=Beatrice Forbes|title=Central Asian Uprisings in the Nineteenth Century: Ferghana under the Russians|journal=[[Russian Review]]|year=1987|volume=46|issue=3|pages=267–281|doi=10.2307/130563|jstor=130563}}</ref>

After the formation of the [[Khanate of Kokand]] in the 18th century, the capital was moved from Andijan to [[Kokand]]. In the mid-19th century, the [[Russian Empire]] began occupying the area of present-day [[Central Asia]]. In 1876, the Russians conquered the Khanate of Kokand and the city of Andijan along with it.

Andijan was the center and flashpoint of the [[Andijan Uprising of 1898]] in which the followers of [[Sufi]] leader [[Madali Ishan]] attacked the Russian barracks in the city, killing 22 and injuring 16-20 more. In retaliation, 18 of the participants were hanged and 360 exiled.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = University of California Press| isbn = 0-520-21355-6| pages = 59| last = Khalid| first = Adeeb |author-link=Adeeb Khalid| title = The Politics of Muslim Cultural Reform: Jadidism in Central Asia|title-link=The Politics of Muslim Cultural Reform: Jadidism in Central Asia| location = Berkeley| series = Comparative studies on Muslim societies| year = 1998}}</ref>

====1902 earthquake====
{{main|1902 Andijan earthquake}}

On 16 December 1902, much of the city was leveled by a severe [[earthquake]] which destroyed up to 30,000 homes in the region and killed as many as 4,500 residents.<ref name="EL"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Kislov|first=D.|title=Paging through old journals: Evidence of the 1902 Andijan Earthquake|url=http://www.fergananews.com/article.php?id=5232|access-date=7 April 2014|newspaper=Ferghana|date=13 July 2007|language=ru}}</ref> After [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule was established in Andijan in 1917, the city quickly became an important industrial city in the [[Uzbek SSR]].

====Soviet era====

During the Soviet demarcation of [[Central Asia]],{{when|date=February 2024}} Andijan was separated from its historical [[hinterland]] as the [[Ferghana Valley]] was divided among three separate Soviet republics. Andijan itself became part of the [[Uzbek SSR]].

During [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]], many Soviet citizens were evacuated to Andijan and the surrounding towns. Of the [[Jewish people|Jewish]] refugees fleeing [[Occupation of Poland (1939–45)|Nazi-occupied Poland]] and banished by the Soviets to [[Siberia]] and [[Central Asia]], some relocated to Andijan starting in 1941.

====Post-Soviet Islamic fundamentalism====
In the 1990s, Andijan and the surrounding region became politically unstable. Poverty and an upsurge in [[Islamic fundamentalism]] produced tensions in the region. The town, and the region as a whole, suffered a severe economic decline following the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. Repeated border closures badly damaged the local economy, worsening the already widespread poverty of Andijan's inhabitants.

[[Soil fertility|Fertile soils]], abundance of [[heat]] and [[light]], long frost-free period (about 210 days a year) favor the cultivation of heat-loving crops - [[cotton]], [[Morus (plant)|mulberry]], citrus and other subtropical crops in the vicinity of the city.

Andijan is surrounded by the [[foothills]] of the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] and [[Tian Shan]] mountains, which in summer are covered with snowy peaks, and in the lower reaches are enveloped by forest groves of [[walnut]] and [[Conifer|coniferous]] forests.

[[Winter|Winters]] are usually mild and short. [[Wind|Winds]] are weaker than in the western parts of the valley, averaging 5 m/s, and average annual precipitation is 232 mm per year. [[Summer|Summers]] are comparatively less hot than in Central Asia.

=== Canals and rivers ===
Main water arteries of Andijan city:

* "Andijonsoy" [[canal]], which crosses Andijan from south-east to north-west (urban length of the canal is 20 km with [[stream bed]] width from 5 to 10 meters);
* 2 rowing canals in the north-west suburb of Andijan (according to the new [[site plan]] they are not included in the [[city limits]]) are parallel and have a length of about 2.8 km with a width of 35-45 meters;
* The [[Kara Darya|Kara Darya River]] flows from the north-east to the north-west of Andijan and its suburbs 3-5 km from the city limits.

Despite the fact that in some places the urban neighborhoods of Andijan's [[Suburb|suburbs]] and the buildings of the [[Tashkent State Agrarian University]] are adjacent to the river, the [[Waterfront (area)|waterfront]] was not included in the new general plan of Andijan (adopted and approved in 2017) and in the city limits.

=== Vegetation ===
The [[vegetation]] of Andijan is diverse and rich. The city itself is decorated with exotic, ornamental, subtropical, fruit, citrus, nut, coniferous and deciduous crops of trees and shrubs. [[Floriculture]] and [[horticulture]] are widely developed.

In the years of Uzbekistan's independence, great importance was attached to planting exotic and subtropical crops to replace the year-round weedy [[Platanus orientalis|chinar]].

In the city streets, squares, alleys and near administrative buildings began to be planted:

* exotic palm trees;
* ornamental trees;
* deciduous trees.

[[Conifer|Conifers]] have been well established in Andijan for many [[Decade|decades]], and over the last 25 years coniferous and [[fir]] trees have become very popular in the city (especially [[picea abies]] and [[blue spruce]], [[Arca (disambiguation)|archa]], [[juniper]], fir, [[cupressus]], [[pine]] and [[cedrus]]).

[[Chestnut|Chestnuts]] and [[Walnut|walnuts]] are also being planted in Andijan, [[Almond|almonds]], [[Pistachio|pistachios]], [[diospyros]], [[elaeagnus angustifolia]], [[jujube]], [[Punica protopunica|pomegranate trees]], wine trees (yellow and black [[Fig|figs]]), [[laurus]] and various [[Fruit tree|fruit trees]] are growing in the [[Courtyard|courtyards]].

==Demographics==
In 2022, Andijan had a population of 458,500.<ref name="andstat"/> Representatives of many ethnic groups can be found in the city. [[Uzbek people|Uzbeks]] are the largest ethnic group.

==Economy==
Andijan has been an important craft and trade center in the [[Fergana Valley]] since the 15th century. After [[annexation]] by the Russians in 1876, the economy of the city started to grow significantly.

== Etymology ==
The etymology of the name of the city of Andijan is complex and yet to be fully determined, involving as it does not only the speculation of certain scholars but also the cautious interpretation of several local folk legends:

* The emergence of the city is associated with the name of the Turanian princess Adinajan, daughter of [[Afrasiab|Afrosiab]], the legendary ruler of ancient Turan. In search of a cure for her chronic ill-health, the ailing princess sought and found healing in one of the mountain valleys of the foothills of [[Takht-e Soleymān]]. To commemorate her miraculous recovery,  Afrosiab built for his beloved daughter a castle, surrounded by a great and wondrous garden, in the lush valley which had restored her to health. Consequently this area, located in the lower reaches of the mountain river Oshsay, was named Adinajan, after the princess, and the city, which later grew up around her castle, was given the name Andijan, a modified form of her name. To do her further honour, the doting Afrosiab made Andijan the capital of his majestic kingdom of [[Turan]].
* The origin of the toponym is directly connected with the Turkic-speaking peoples "Adok", "Azok" and "Andi". Folk rumor says that in ancient times these lands were inhabited by the Andi tribe, i.e. Hindus, and therefore the area was called "Andukan" (or "Hindu refuge").
* The name of the city is connected with the name of the so-called "discoverer" of the region, who laid the foundation of the future city. His name was Andi. So, in honor of the ancient builder-architect the city was named "Andijan".
* Russian historian V. P. Nalivkin supposes that the toponym "Andigan" appeared due to the name of the Turkic tribe Andi. The fact is that until some time residents of neighboring regions often called Andijan Uzbeks by the name of Andi, and claimed that Andi were of the same origin as those Turks who lived in the cities of [[Central Asia]].
* According to [[Vasily Bartold]], Andijan was founded by [[Mongol Khan|Mongol Khans]] at the end of the XIII century. Turks from different tribes and clans were transferred here. At the end of the XV century Andijan was considered a predominantly Turkic city in Fergana.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2011-11-02 |title=В.В.БАРТОЛЬД О НАЦИОНАЛЬНОМ РАЗМЕЖЕВАНИИ В СРЕДНЕЙ АЗИИ |url=http://kungrad.com/history/sssr/barthold/ |access-date=2023-11-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102191228/http://kungrad.com/history/sssr/barthold/ |archive-date=2011-11-02 }}</ref>
