==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2023}}
Panvel (also known as Panwell by the British) is about 300 years old, developed around trade routes (both land and sea), during the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] rule and hence after by the Mughal rule, [[British Raj|British]] and the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]]. Once upon a time, Panvel was famous for its rice market. Panvel Municipal Council (PMC) was established in the year 1852, and was the oldest municipal council of Maharashtra, before the formation of [[Panvel Municipal Corporation]]. Panvel Municipal Council's elections started in the year 1910. The first mayor of the PMC was Mr. Yusuf Noor Mohammed Master Kachchi for the years 1910–1916. The sesquicentennial anniversary (150th anniversary) of the PMC was celebrated in the year 2002. The city prospered and grew due to the influence of large scale trade by land and sea. This was characterised by the large palace-like homes that came up during the Peshwa period. It is also said that old name of this city was Paneli (Panelim in Konkani). There were historic cannons (during the time of [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]]) situated on Panvel fort. On 1 October 2016, [[Panvel Municipal Corporation]] came into existence.

[[Panvel railway station]] is one of the most important junctions on [[Central Railway (India)|Central Railway]]. [[Harbour line]] from [[Mumbai CSMT]], central line from [[Diva railway station|Diva]] / [[Karjat railway station|Karjat]], [[Western Dedicated Freight Corridor]] from [[JNPT]] and the line from [[Roha railway station|Roha]] meet at Panvel. [[Panvel railway station]] comes under Mumbai division of Central Railway.

[[Indian Railways]]'s [[Central Railway (India)|Central Railway]] division conducted an inaugural run of an AC local train from [[Panvel railway station|Panvel]] to [[Thane railway station|Thane]] on 30 January 2020 at 3:30&nbsp;pm on an open path towards Thane. On its return journey, the train ran from Thane to Panvel on an open path. The AC Local started its regular commercial services from 31 January 2020. The AC local also starts from [[Nerul railway station|Nerul]] and [[Vashi railway station|Vashi]] to Thane. On the day of its inaugural run, many travellers boarded the train as they weren't aware that a separate ticket was needed to board the AC Local. The train was even made to halt at one station as one door got blocked and wasn't opening. This further delayed the train's as well as other trains' timings on the route. This all happened despite the train had security guards and ticket checkers. Following this incident, the number of security guards and ticket checkers was nearly doubled and awareness was being created amongst travellers.
