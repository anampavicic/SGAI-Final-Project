==History==
{{Main|Fort Wayne (fort)|Fort Miami (Indiana)|Kekionga}}

===Early history===
====The Native Americans and New France====
[[File:Map of Kekionga.jpg|thumb|An illustrated 1789 map of [[Kekionga]]]]

==== Original settlement and French control (1706-1760) ====
This area here on the river [[confluence]] was occupied by successive cultures of [[indigenous peoples]] for as long as 10,000 years.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kekionga Historical Marker |url=https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=21501 |access-date=July 26, 2023 |website=www.hmdb.org |language=en}}</ref> The [[Miami tribe]] would eventually establish its settlement of [[Kekionga]] at this confluence of the [[Maumee River|Maumee]], [[St. Joseph River (Maumee River)|St. Joseph]], and [[St. Marys River (Indiana and Ohio)|St. Marys]] rivers in the late stages of the [[Beaver Wars]] in the 1690s.<ref name=":0"/><ref>{{Cite web |title=Miami Indians |url=https://project.geo.msu.edu/geogmich/Miamis.html |access-date=July 13, 2023 |website=project.geo.msu.edu}}</ref> It was the capital of the Miami nation and related [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes.{{efn|According to J. Dunn, Jr., this name was "usually said to mean "blackberry patch," or "blackberry bush," this plant being considered an emblem of antiquity because it sprang up on the sites of old villages. This theory rests on the testimony of Barron, a longtime French trader on the Wabash. It is more probable that Kekionga is a corruption or dialect form of Kiskakon, or Kikakon, which was the original name of the place." J. P. Dunn.<ref>INDIANA: A REDEMPTION FROM SLAVERY New York: Houghton Mifflin and Company, 1888, 48, Note 1.</ref> But, Michael McCafferty, an Algonquian and Uto-Aztecan linguist professor at Indiana University, exhaustively examined the etymology of 'Kekionga' and dismissed Dunn's explanation and several others. See the chapter "Trails to Kekionga" in the relevantly titled ''Native American Place Names of Indiana'' (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2008), esp. p. 76. In the 1680s, [[French people|French]] traders established a post near Kekionga due to its location on a [[portage]] between the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Mississippi River]].<ref>Goodrich, De Witt C. and Charles Richard Tuttle (1875) An Illustrated History of the State of Indiana. (NP:R. S. Peale & Co., ND).</ref>}}

In 1696, [[Comte de Frontenac]] appointed [[Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes]], who began visiting Kekionga in 1702, and would later build the original [[Fort Miami (Indiana)|Fort Miami]] here in the wilderness and [[pays d'en Haut]] of [[New France]] around 1706; Initially, a small trading outpost.<ref name=":0">Poinsatte, 18</ref> It was part of a group of forts and trading posts built between [[Quebec]] and [[St. Louis]]. The first census in 1744 recorded a population of approximately 40 Frenchmen and 1,000 Miamians.<ref name="IND">Peckham, Howard Henry (2003) "Indiana: A History". ''W.W. Norton'' {{ISBN|0-252-07146-8}}.</ref>

====From the British back to the Miami (1760-1776)====
Increasing tension between France and Great Britain developed over control of the territory. In 1760, France ceded the area to Britain after its forces in North America surrendered during the [[Seven Years' War]], known on the North American front as the [[French and Indian War]]. Managing to hold down the fort for only a mere couple of years, the British lost control of it in 1763 when various Native American nations rebelled against British rule and retook the fort as part of [[Pontiac's Rebellion]]. From this point forward in 1763, no active fort existed at Kekionga for the next three decades until American General [[Anthony Wayne]] established [[Fort Wayne (fort)|Fort Wayne]] in 1794, following the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]]. The fort throughout this period was described as a, "Defiant mixture of Indian warriors and lawless renegades of the frontier, such as the Girties. It was also the home of a heterogeneous population of English and French traders and their families, French 'engages", and Miami, Delaware and Shawnee tribes."<ref>Poinsatte, 33</ref>

In 1772, the British regained influence over the village after [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet|Sir William Johnson]] suggested to the government that the fort be reoccupied.<ref name=":0" /> The mixed population of the Kekionga area had moved past antipathy with the British by this point, and accepted their friendship. In 1776, Officer Jacques LaSalle moved into the village to conduct strict supervision on behalf of the British government, ensuring that the natives remained loyal to the British, and to check passports with travelers coming down from [[Fort Detroit]].<ref>Poinsatte, 34</ref>

====American Revolution to the Old Northwest====
The British continued to monitor Kekionga and [[Fort Miami (Indiana)|Fort Miami]] throughout the [[American Revolutionary War]]. In 1780, [[French Canadians|French Canadian]] soldiers coming to assist the U.S. with the revolution were slaughtered in several nearby locations in what is known as [[La Balme's Defeat]]. At the end of the Revolutionary War, in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, Britain ceded this area to the new United States, though they continued to maintain an influence on trading activity and the forts of Miami, with the primary objective being to slow American expansion into the [[Great Lakes region]]. The young United States formally organized the region in the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] and negotiated treaties allowing settlement, but the [[Western Confederacy]] of Native American nations were not party to these treaties and did not cede their ownership of those lands.

American land speculators and pioneers began flooding down the [[Ohio River]] into the area, leading to conflict with an alliance of native tribes known as the [[Western Confederacy]]. It was headquartered at Kekionga, where the Miami had permitted two refugee tribes dislodged by white homesteaders, the Delaware and the Shawnee, to resettle. The confederacy—which included other Great Lakes and [[Algonquin people|Algonquin tribes]] as well—began sending war parties to raid settlers, hoping to drive them back across the [[Appalachian Mountains]], and refused to meet for negotiations over a possible treaty to instead cede land for white settlement. The growing violence led to the [[Northwest Indian War]].

In 1790, President [[George Washington]] ordered the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] to subdue and pacify the tribes. The first expedition, led by General [[Josiah Harmar]] reached Kekionga and exercised [[scorched earth]] tactics on the village and crops. Miami war chief [[Little Turtle]], who had been long tracking the whereabouts of Harmar though the aid of various agents such as [[Simon Girty]], would quickly drive Harmar and the US troops away. The confederacy warriors attacked the second invading force, led in 1791 by General [[Arthur St. Clair]], before it could get that far and wiped it out, in a massacre known as [[St. Clair's Defeat]] at modern-day [[Fort Recovery, Ohio]]. It's known as the greatest defeat of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] by Native Americans in history. This defeat left the US army crippled and borders open to attacks from the British and allied native tribes. General [[Anthony Wayne]] was recalled from civilian life to lead a third expedition, defeating the confederacy's warriors at the Battle of [[Fallen Timbers]], near modern-day [[Toledo, Ohio]] on August 20, 1794. Wayne's men then marched up the [[Maumee River]], systematically burning evacuated native towns, crops, and winter food stores, until they reached its headwaters, where Kekionga remained in ruins. Wayne then confronted the British at Fort Miami, where the British debated an attack. Later, Wayne selected the site for construction of [[Fort Wayne (Fort)|Fort Wayne]], he ordered a fort that could withstand heavy British artillery, especially a 24-pound cannon, along with attacks from their army or native allies.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hogeland |first1=William |title=Autumn of the Black Snake: the creation of the U.S. Army and the invasion that opened the West |date=2017 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |location=New York |lccn=2016052193 |isbn=978-0-374-10734-5 |edition=First}}</ref>

The following year, Wayne negotiated a peace accord, the [[Treaty of Greenville]] with tribal leaders, in which they agreed to stop fighting, end support of the British, and ceded most of what is now Ohio along with certain tracts further west, including the area around Fort Wayne encompassing Kekionga and the land portage. Wayne promised the remainder would remain Indian lands, which is why the territory west of [[Ohio]] was named Indiana. Wayne would die one year later and a Spanish spy [[James Wilkinson]] would assume his role as General. In subsequent years, the government used Fort Wayne to hand out annual payments under the treaty. But in a recurring cycle, the tribes ran up debts to white traders who came there to sell them alcohol and manufactured goods, and the government pushed tribal leaders—including through bribes—to sell more reservation land to pay off those debts and, when the land was gone, then to agree to have the tribe removed to the Far West.

===Modern history===

At the turn of the 20th century, the population of Fort Wayne nearly reached 50,000, attributed to a large influx of [[German American|German]] and [[Irish Americans|Irish]] [[immigrants]]. Fort Wayne's "urban working class" thrived in industrial and railroad-related jobs.{{Sfn|Beatty|2006|p = 73}} The city's economy was substantially based on manufacturing, ushering in an era of innovation with several notable inventions and developments coming out of the city over the years, such as [[fuel dispenser|gasoline pumps]] (1885), the [[refrigerator]] (1913), and in 1972, the first [[Magnavox Odyssey|home video game console]].{{Sfn|Beatty|2006|p = 350–355}}<ref>[https://www.justice.gov/usao/inn/division-ftwyane.html USDOJ: US Attorney's Office - Northern District of Indiana].

[[File:Three Rivers, Fort Wayne, Indiana.JPG|thumb|The St. Marys River (left) and St. Joseph River (right) converge to form the Maumee River (foreground).]]

For a regional [[summit (topography)|summit]], the city is situated on flat land characterized by little topographical relief, a result of the [[Wisconsin glaciation|Wisconsin glaciation episode]].<ref name=Geological>{{cite book |last1=Hill |first1=Christopher |title=Geological Framework and Glaciation of the Eastern Area |date=2006 |publisher=Boise State University}}</ref> Receding [[glacier]]s eroded the land, depositing an evenly distributed layer of sediment during the [[last glacial period]]. The most distinguishable topographical feature is [[Cedar Creek Canyon (Indiana)|Cedar Creek Canyon]], just north of the city proper near [[Huntertown, Indiana|Huntertown]].<ref name=Geological/> The [[Fort Wayne Moraine]] follows two of the city's three rivers: the [[St. Marys River (Indiana)|St. Marys]] and [[St. Joseph River (Maumee River)|St. Joseph]]. The two rivers converge to form the [[Maumee River|Maumee]], which eventually empties into [[Lake Erie]]. Land east of the moraine includes the former [[Great Black Swamp]], a [[lacustrine plain]] formed by [[Glacial Lake Maumee]]. The [[Little River (Indiana)|Little River]] flows southwest of Fort Wayne, a tributary of the [[Wabash River]], and remnant of the [[Maumee Torrent]].

Fort Wayne is situated on the [[Saint Lawrence River Divide]], a [[continental divide]] separating the [[Great Lakes Basin]] from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] watershed.

The most important geographical feature of the area is the short distance over land between the Three Rivers system, which eventually flows to the Atlantic, and the Wabash system, which eventually flows to the Gulf of Mexico. This came to be the "portage" or carrying place, over which travelers could transport their cargoes from one system to the next. This natural crossroads attracted the Native Americans for thousands of years. It later attracted the European explorers and traders and the American pioneer settlers who continued to develop the area as a transportation and communications center. Chief Little Turtle of the Miami Nation expressed its importance eloquently at the treaty of Greenville in 1795 when he called it "that glorious gate...through which all the words of our chiefs had to pass through from north to south and from east to west".

Fort Wayne's early 20th century development was influenced by the [[City Beautiful movement]] and centered on a [[Fort Wayne Park and Boulevard System Historic District|park and boulevard plan]] conceived by [[urban planner]] [[Charles Mulford Robinson]] in 1909 and finalized by [[landscape architect]] [[George Kessler]] in 1912. The master plan proposed a network of parkways and boulevards connecting the city's three rivers and Spy Run Creek to dozens of neighborhoods and parks. Several parks were designed by noted landscape architect [[Arthur Asahel Shurcliff]]. Much of the original plan was implemented by 1955. In 2010, the Fort Wayne Park and Boulevard System was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], consisting of 11 public parks, four parkways, and ten boulevards, covering {{convert|1,883|acres|ha|0}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.in.gov/dnr/historic/files/hp-FortWayneParks.pdf |title=Fort Wayne Parks and Boulevard System |publisher=City of Fort Wayne |access-date=May 10, 2014 |archive-date=September 1, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140901140322/http://www.in.gov/dnr/historic/files/hp-FortWayneParks.pdf |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityoffortwayne.org/latest-news/1935-parks-boulevard-system-now-on-national-historic-register.html |title=Parks, boulevard system now on National Historic Register |publisher=City of Fort Wayne |access-date=May 10, 2014}}</ref>

Since at least the early 20th century, Fort Wayne has maintained a [[combined sewage overflow]] program, which has resulted in the city routinely discharging untreated human waste, raw sewage from businesses and homes, toxic waste from industrial sites, and agricultural runoff into all three rivers in a number of locations, particularly during heavy rainfall events.<ref>{{Cite web |date=January 25, 2021 |title=Combined Sewers {{!}} Fort Wayne City Utilities |url=https://utilities.cityoffortwayne.org/sewer-system/combined-sewer-overflow |access-date=July 29, 2023 |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=January 25, 2021 |title=CSO Notification {{!}} Fort Wayne City Utilities |url=https://utilities.cityoffortwayne.org/sewer-system/cso-notifications |access-date=July 29, 2023 |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Re: 2022 CSO Great Lakes Public Notification Plan Annual Report |url=https://utilities.cityoffortwayne.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/City-of-Fort-Wayne-Great-Lakes-CSO-Public-Notification-Annual-Report-2022.pdf}}</ref> However, as of 2023, a several million dollar citywide sewage overflow tunnel project is set to be completed, among additional efforts, such as a $135 million investment from the city into [[rain garden]]s, to prevent further discharge into the rivers.<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 18, 2023 |title=What are raingardens?

In 2017, the [[Fort Wayne metropolitan area]] had a [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) of $25.7 billion. The top four industries were manufacturing ($8.1B), health care ($2.54B), retail trade ($1.4B), and finance and insurance ($1.3B) Government, if it had been a private industry, would have tied for third, generating $1.4 billion.<ref>{{cite news |first=Kevin |last=Leininger |date=June 17, 2018 |url=http://www.news-sentinel.com/news/local-news/2018/06/17/focus-2018-even-in-a-robust-fort-wayne-economy-some-segments-are-growing-faster-than-others/ |title=FOCUS 2018: Even in a robust Fort Wayne economy, some segments are growing faster than others |work=The News-Sentinel |access-date=December 23, 2018}}</ref>

Manufacturing is deeply rooted in Fort Wayne's economic history, dating to the earliest days of the city's growth as an important trade stop along the [[Wabash and Erie Canal]]. Railroads, introduced shortly after the canal's arrival, eased travel from Fort Wayne to other booming industrial centers along the Great Lakes, such as [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], and [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]]. Throughout the early and mid-20th century, manufacturing dominated the city's economic landscape. From 1900 to 1930, Fort Wayne's industrial output expanded by 747 percent, with total production valued at $95 million in 1929, up from $11 million in 1899.{{Sfn|Beatty|2006|p = 89}} The total workforce also increased from 18,000 in 1900 to nearly 50,000 in 1930.{{Sfn|Beatty|2006|p = 89}}

The airport is Indiana's second busiest, with over 350,000 passenger enplanements in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.faa.gov/airports/planning_capacity/passenger_allcargo_stats/passenger/ |title=Passenger Boarding (Enplanement) and All-Cargo Data for U.S. Airports |publisher=[[Federal Aviation Administration]] |access-date=March 29, 2017}}</ref> Fort Wayne International is also home to the [[122nd Fighter Wing]]'s [[Fort Wayne Air National Guard Station]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.122fw.ang.af.mil/history/index.asp |publisher=122nd Fighter Wing |title=Home of the Blacksnakes |access-date=June 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627063551/http://www.122fw.ang.af.mil/history/index.asp |archive-date=June 27, 2010}}</ref> [[Smith Field (Indiana)|Smith Field]], in northern Fort Wayne, is used primarily for [[general aviation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://smdairport.com/airport-history.aspx |publisher=Smith Field Airport |title=Airport History |access-date=December 27, 2012 |archive-date=March 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314211846/http://www.smdairport.com/airport-history.aspx |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Fort Wayne is served by a single Interstate, ([[Interstate 69 in Indiana|Interstate 69]]), along with an auxiliary beltway ([[Interstate 469]]). Once the [[Indiana State Road 37|State Road 37]] expressway between [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] and [[Martinsville, Indiana|Martinsville]] is completed in 2018{{update inline|date=May 2024}}, filling a gap in I-69 that exists south of [[Indianapolis]], the road will run south to [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]]; it currently runs north to the [[Canada–United States border]] at [[Port Huron, Michigan]]. In the coming years, [[Interstate 69|I-69]] will extend to the [[Mexico–United States border|US–Mexico border]] in Texas, with branches ending in [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]], [[Pharr, Texas|Pharr]], and [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]]. Four [[United States Numbered Highways|U.S. Routes]] bisect the city, including [[U.S. Route 24 in Indiana|US&nbsp;24]], [[U.S. Route 27 in Indiana|US&nbsp;27]], [[U.S. Route 30 in Indiana|US&nbsp;30]], and [[U.S. Route 33 in Indiana|US&nbsp;33]].

Unlike most cities comparable to its size, Fort Wayne does not have an urban [[Controlled-access highway|freeway]] system. In 1946, planners proposed a $27 million federally funded freeway, crossing east–west and north–south through downtown.{{Sfn|Beatty|2006|p = 190}} Opponents successfully campaigned against the proposal, objecting to the demolition of nearly 1,500 homes at the time of the post-World War II housing shortage, while playing on fears that the project would force displaced minorities into white neighborhoods.{{Sfn|Beatty|2006|p = 108}}<ref>{{cite news |first=Kevin |last=Leininger |date=December 3, 2011 |url=http://www.news-sentinel.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20111203/NEWS/111209914 |title=Fort Wayne: Fat, stupid... and melancholy? |work=The News-Sentinel |access-date=February 5, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207184655/http://www.news-sentinel.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20111203%2FNEWS%2F111209914 |archive-date=December 7, 2011}}</ref> In 1947, Fort Wayne residents voted down the referendum that would have allowed for its construction, dubbed the 'Anthony Wayne Parkway.'<ref name="Interstate" /> Beginning in 1962, construction commenced for I-69 in suburban Fort Wayne.{{Sfn|Beatty|2006|p = 117}}{{Sfn|Beatty|2006|p = 119}}

Amtrak's ''[[Capitol Limited (Amtrak train)|Capitol Limited]]'' (Chicago—Toledo—Cleveland—Pittsburgh—Washington, D.C.) and Amtrak's ''[[Lake Shore Limited]]'' (Chicago—Toledo—Cleveland—Buffalo—Albany—split to Boston and to New York City) are the closest passenger rail services to Fort Wayne, located {{convert|25|mi|km}} north at [[Waterloo (Amtrak station)|Waterloo Station]]. Service by Amtrak ended in 1990 when the ''Broadway Limited'' was rerouted away from Fort Wayne's [[Pennsylvania Railroad Station (Fort Wayne, Indiana)|Pennsylvania Station]]. Until 1961 the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] operated the north–south ''[[Northern Arrow]]'' through the station. Other stations in Fort Wayne served the passenger trains of the [[Chicago, Indianapolis, and Louisville Railway]] ('Monon Railroad') and the [[Wabash Railroad]] (hosting the east–west ''[[Wabash Cannon Ball (train)|Wabash Cannon Ball]]).''<ref>'Official Guide of the Railways,' June 1961, Index of Railroad Stations</ref><ref>Wabash Railroad, 1959 timetable, Table 11 http://streamlinermemories.info/Eastern/Wabash59TT.pdf</ref>
