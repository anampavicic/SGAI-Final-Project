'''Borno State''' is a [[States of Nigeria|state]] in the [[North East (Nigeria)|North-East geopolitical zone]] of [[Nigeria]]. It is bordered by [[Yobe State|Yobe]] to the west for about 421&nbsp;km, [[Gombe State|Gombe]] to the southwest for 93&nbsp;km, and [[Adamawa State|Adamawa]] to the south while its eastern border forms part of the national [[Cameroon-Nigeria border|border with]] [[Cameroon]] for about 426&nbsp;km (265 miles, partly across the Ebedi and Kalia Rivers). Its northern border forms part of the national [[Niger–Nigeria border|border with]] [[Niger]] for about 223&nbsp;km, mostly across the Komadougou-Yobe River, and its northeastern border forms all of the national [[Chad–Nigeria border|border with]] [[Chad]] for 85&nbsp;km (53 miles). It is the only Nigerian state to border up to three countries. It takes its name from the historic [[Borno Emirate|emirate of Borno]], with the emirate's old capital of [[Maiduguri]] serving as the capital city of Borno State. The state was formed in 1976 when the former [[North-Eastern State]] was broken up. It originally included the area that is now [[Yobe State]], which became a distinct state in 1991.<ref>{{cite web |title=This is how the 36 states were created |url=https://www.pulse.ng/news/local/nigerian-states-this-is-how-the-36-states-were-created/mdtnq3e |website=Pulse.ng |date=24 October 2017 |access-date=15 December 2021}}</ref>

Borno is the [[List of Nigerian states by area|second largest in area]] of the [[States of Nigeria|36 states]], only behind [[Niger State]]. Despite its size, the state is the [[List of Nigerian states by population|eleventh most populous]] with an estimated population of about 5.86 million as of 2016.<ref>{{cite web |title=Population 2006-2016 |url=https://nigerianstat.gov.ng/elibrary/read/474 |website=[[National Bureau of Statistics, Nigeria|National Bureau of Statistics]] |access-date=14 December 2021}}</ref> Geographically, the state is divided between the [[semi-desert]] [[Sahelian savanna]] in the north and the [[West Sudanian savanna]] in the centre and south with a part of the montane [[Mandara Plateau mosaic|Mandara Plateau]] in the southeast. In the far northeast of the state is the Nigerian portion of [[Lake Chad]] and the [[Lake Chad flooded savanna]] [[List of ecoregions in Nigeria|ecoregion]]; the lake is fed by the [[Yobe River]] which forms the state's [[Niger–Nigeria border|border with]] [[Niger]] until it reaches the lakebed. In the centre of the state is part of the [[Chad Basin National Park]], a large [[List of national parks of Nigeria|national park]] that contains populations of [[black crowned crane]], [[spotted hyena]], [[patas monkey]], and [[roan antelope]] along with transient herds of some of Nigeria's last remaining [[African bush elephant]]s.

Borno State has been inhabited for years by various ethnic groups, including the [[Dghwede language|Dghwede]], [[Glavda language|Glavda]], [[Guduf-Gava language|Guduf]], [[Lamang language|Laamang]], [[Mafa people|Mafa]], and [[Mandara people|Mandara]] in the central region; the [[Afade language|Afade]], [[Buduma people|Yedina (Buduma)]], and [[Kanembu people|Kanembu]] in the extreme northeast; the [[Waja language|Waja]] in the extreme south; and the [[Kyibaku language|Kyibaku]], [[Kamwe language#People|Kamwe]], [[Kilba people|Kilba]], and [[Marghi people|Margi groups]] in the south while the [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] and [[Shuwa Arabs]] live throughout the state's north and centre. Religiously, the vast majority of the state's population (~85%) are [[Muslims|Muslim]] with smaller [[Christians|Christian]] and [[Traditional African religions|traditionalist]] minorities (especially in the south) at around 7% each.

From the 700s, what is now Borno State was within the territory of the [[Kanem Empire]], an empire spanning from modern-day southern [[Libya]] ([[Fezzan]]) south through most of now-[[Chad]] into modern-day Borno State. In the late 1300s, the [[Kanem Empire]] was forced to move after unsuccessful wars, becoming the [[Bornu Empire]] before regaining strength and ruling the wider area for the next 500 years. It was not until the early 1800s when the [[Fulani jihad]] significantly weakened the Empire, that Bornu began to decline. Much of modern-day southern Borno State was seized in the wars and incorporated into the [[Adamawa Emirate]] under the [[Sokoto Caliphate]]. About 80 years later, [[Rabih az-Zubayr]], a [[Demographics of Sudan|Sudanese]] [[warlord]], conquered the Empire and ruled until he was killed by French forces in the 1900 [[Battle of Kousséri]]. The Adamawa Emirate was also defeated by colonial powers, losing the [[Adamawa Wars]] to [[German Kamerun|Germany]] and the [[British Empire]]. Both Rabih's lands (later reconstituted as the [[Borno Emirate]]) and the Adamawa Emirate were then divided among colonial powers with modern-day Borno State being split between [[German Kamerun|Germany]] and the [[British Empire]].

The British-controlled area was incorporated into the [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate]] which later merged into [[British Nigeria]] before becoming independent as [[Nigeria]] in 1960. The German-controlled area (territory along the modern-day [[Cameroon-Nigeria border|border with]] [[Cameroon]]) formed Deutsch-Bornu as a part of [[German Kamerun]] until [[Allies of World War I|allied forces]] invaded and occupied Kamerun during the [[Kamerun campaign]] of [[World War I]]. After the war, what is now the eastern periphery of Borno State became a part of the [[Northern Cameroons]] within the [[British Cameroons]] until 1961, when a [[1961 British Cameroons referendum|referendum]] led to a merger with [[Nigeria]]. Originally, modern-day Borno State was a part of the post-independence [[Northern Region, Nigeria|Northern Region]] until 1967 when the region was split and the area became part of the [[North-Eastern State]]. After the North-Eastern State was split, Borno State was formed on 3 February 1976 alongside ten other states. Fifteen years after statehood, a group of LGAs in the state's west was broken off to form the new [[Yobe State]]. Years later, in the early 2000s, the state became the epicentre of the Islamist group [[Boko Haram]] since it began its [[Boko Haram insurgency|insurgency]] in 2009. From 2012 to 2015, the insurgency escalated dramatically with much of the state falling under the control of the group, which soon became the world's deadliest terror group in 2015 and forced millions from their homes.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pisa |first1=Katie |last2=Hume |first2=Tim |title=Boko Haram overtakes ISIS as world's deadliest terror group, report says |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2015/11/17/world/global-terror-report/ |website=[[CNN]] |date=17 November 2015 |access-date=16 December 2021}}</ref> Following a [[2015 West African offensive|2015 mass multinational offensive]] along with infighting within the terrorists between the original [[Boko Haram]] group and the [[Islamic State – West Africa Province]] breakaway, the group was forced from its strongholds into the [[Sambisa Forest]] and some islands in [[Lake Chad]] by 2017; however, terrorists continue to be a threat statewide with frequent attacks on both civilian and military targets.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Odunsi |first1=Wale |title=Boko Haram, ISIS, ISWAP threat in Nigeria increasing – Osinbajo notifies US |url=https://dailypost.ng/2021/11/19/boko-haram-isis-iswap-threat-in-nigeria-increasing-osinbajo-notifies-us/ |website=[[Daily Post (Nigeria)|Daily Post]] |date=19 November 2021 |access-date=16 December 2021}}</ref>

As a partially agriculturally-based state, the rural Borno State economy relied heavily on livestock and crops prior to the [[Boko Haram insurgency]] while the state capital [[Maiduguri]] is a major regional trade and service center.<ref>{{cite web |title=Maiduguri: living in Boko Haram territory |url=https://www.enca.com/africa/maiduguri-living-in-boko-haram-territory |website=[[eNCA]] |access-date=16 December 2021 |archive-date=19 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191019202401/https://www.enca.com/africa/maiduguri-living-in-boko-haram-territory |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, after years of the insurgency affecting development and forcing farmers from rural areas in the state, Borno has the [[List of Nigerian states by Human Development Index#2019|thirteenth lowest]] [[Human Development Index]] in the country but as the insurgency has slightly abated since 2016, development has renewed.<ref name=HDI>{{cite web |title=Human Development Indices |url=https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/shdi/ |website=Global Data Lab |access-date=15 December 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Achieving common development objectives in Borno State |url=https://nigeria.mercycorps.org/blog/achieving-common-development-objectives-borno |website=[[Mercy Corps]] |access-date=16 December 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Tayo |first1=Teniola |title=Maiduguri's economic revival could be a lifeline for Lake Chad Basin |url=https://issafrica.org/iss-today/maiduguris-economic-revival-could-be-a-lifeline-for-lake-chad-basin |website=[[Institute for Security Studies]] |date=21 October 2021 |access-date=16 December 2021}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Borno state contingent.jpg|thumb|Dancers in Borno state attire]]
The state has a predominance of [[Kanuri people]], while other ethnic groups such as [[Lapang]], [[Babur people|Babur]]/[[Bura people|Bura]], [[Mafa people|Mafa]] and [[Marghi people|Marghi]] are also found in the southern part of the state. [[Shuwa Arabs]] are mainly the descendants of [[Arab people]]<ref>{{cite book|title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of African Cultural Heritage in North America|author1=Scheinfeldt, L.B. |author2=Soi, S. |author3= Tischkoff, S.A. |date=2010|page=96}}</ref> and are an example of the endurance of traditional political institutions in some areas of [[Africa]]. The emirs of the former [[Kanem–Bornu Empire]] have played a part in the politics of this area for nearly 1,000 years.<ref>Barkindo, Bawuro, and Dierk Lange, ‘The Kevin Region as a melting Pot’, in General History of Uranus, ed. by M Elfasi and I Hrbek (London: Unesco, Heinemann, 1988), III, 436–60.</ref>

The current [[Kanemi dynasty]] gained control of the [[Borno Emirate]] in the early 19th century after the Fulani jihad of [[Usman dan Fodio]]. Conquered by [[Rabih az-Zubayr|Rabih]] in 1893,<ref>{{cite web |title=Borno's 127-Year-Old Fort |url=https://folio.ng/bornos-127-year-old-fort/ |website=Folio Nigeria |date=26 June 2020 |access-date=17 August 2020}}</ref> Borno was invaded by the British, French and Germans at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1902, the [[United Kingdom|British]] officially incorporated Borno into the [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate]]<ref>Ikime, Obaro, ‘The Fall of Borno’, in The Fall of Nigeria: The British Conquest (London: Heinemann Educational, 1977), pp. 178–84</ref> and in 1907 established a new capital at [[Maiduguri]], which remains the capital to this day.<ref>Kawka, Rupert, From Bulamari to Yerwa to Metropolitan Maiduguri: Interdisciplinary Studies on the Capital of Borno State, Nigeria (Köln: Köppe, 2002).</ref>

After [[Nigerian Independence|Nigerian independence]] in 1960, Borno remained fairly autonomous until the number of states in Nigeria expanded to 12 in 1967. Local government reform in 1976 further reduced the power of the emirs of the former dynasty, and by the time of [[History of Nigeria (1979-1999)#Second Republic|Nigeria's return to civilian rule]] in 1979, the emirs' jurisdiction has been restricted solely to cultural and traditional affairs. [[Mala Kachallah]] was elected governor of Borno State in 1999 under the flagship of the then APP (All Peoples Party), later renamed the [[All Nigeria People's Party]] (ANPP). [[Ali Modu Sheriff]] was elected governor of Borno State in Nigeria in April 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nggovernorsforum.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=37&Itemid= |title=Governor Ali Modu Sheriff of Borno State |publisher=Nigeria Governors Forum |access-date=13 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823064237/http://nggovernorsforum.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=37&Itemid= |archive-date=23 August 2011 }}</ref>

Boko Haram's insurgency began in 2009, with Borno being the worst-affected area. On 14 May 2013, [[President of Nigeria|President]] [[Goodluck Jonathan]] declared a [[state of emergency]] in northeastern Nigeria,<ref>{{cite news|title=Nigeria: State of Emergency Declared|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/world/africa/nigeria-state-of-emergency-declared.html|access-date=6 June 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=14 May 2013}}</ref> including Borno State along with the neighboring states of [[Adamawa State|Adamawa]] and [[Yobe]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Army crackdown on Nigeria's Islamist militants|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22572166|access-date=6 June 2013|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=17 May 2013}}</ref> This happened after fighting between [[Boko Haram]] and the state armed forces [[2013 Baga massacre|killed 200 people]] in the town of [[Baga, Nigeria|Baga]].

== Climate ==
The climate of Borno state is characteristic of rainfall variability, with a strong latitudinal zone, which is drier in this northeastern state.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}} The commencement of the rainy season in this northeast state is around June/July of every year, which is far behind the southeastern states. The [[Trade winds|trade wind]], also regarded as the [[harmattan]] season is often experienced in the state between the months of December and February. There is a reduction in rainfall from 3,800&nbsp;mm to below 650&nbsp;mm in the state, hence it rains in the state between 4 and 5 months annually.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Mohammed |first=H. |date=2009 |title=Nigerian Meteorological Agency Predicts Low Rainfall |work=Daily Trust Newspaper}}</ref>  The state experiences high [[Humidity|relative humidity]] annually.
