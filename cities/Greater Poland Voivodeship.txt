'''Greater Poland Voivodeship''' ({{langx|pl|Województwo wielkopolskie}} {{IPA|pl|vɔjɛˈvut͡stfɔ vjɛlkɔˈpɔlskʲɛ||LL-Q809 (pol)-KaMan-województwo wielkopolskie.wav}}) is a [[Voivodeships of Poland|voivodeship]], or [[province]], in west-central [[Poland]]. The province is named after the region called [[Greater Poland]] or ''Wielkopolska'' {{IPAc-pl|AUD|Pl-Wielkopolska.ogg|w|j|e|l|k|o|'|p|o|l|s|k|a}}. The modern province includes most of this historic region, except for some western and northern parts.

Greater Poland Voivodeship is second in area and third in population among Poland's sixteen voivodeships, with an area of {{convert|29826|km2|sqmi}} and a population of close to 3.5&nbsp;million. Its capital city is [[Poznań]]; other important cities include [[Kalisz]], [[Konin]], [[Piła]], [[Ostrów Wielkopolski]], [[Gniezno]] (an early capital of Poland) and [[Leszno]]. It is bordered by seven other voivodeships: [[West Pomeranian Voivodeship|West Pomeranian]] to the northwest, [[Pomeranian Voivodeship|Pomeranian]] to the north, [[Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Kuyavian-Pomeranian]] to the north-east, [[Łódź Voivodeship|Łódź]] to the south-east, [[Opole Voivodeship|Opole]] to the south, [[Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Lower Silesian]] to the southwest and [[Lubusz Voivodeship|Lubusz]] to the west.

==History==
Greater Poland, sometimes called the "cradle of Poland," formed the heart of the 10th-century [[History of Poland (966–1385)|early Polish state]]. [[Poznań]] and [[Gniezno]] were early centers of royal power, but following the region's devastation by [[pagan]] rebellion in the 1030s, and an invasion by [[Bretislaus I of Bohemia]] in 1038, the capital was moved by [[Casimir the Restorer]] from Gniezno to [[Kraków]].<ref name="wilson">{{cite book |author1=Neil Wilson |author2=Tom Parkinson |author3=Richard Watkins |title=Poland |year=2005 |page=339 |publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=1-74059-522-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2LId4cLRMkoC&q=Gniezno+8th+century&pg=PA339 |format=[[Google Books]] |access-date=22 December 2023}}</ref> The two cities are seats of Poland's oldest diocese ([[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Poznań|Poznań]], est. in 968) and archdiocese ([[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gniezno|Gniezno]], est. in 1000), playing a crucial role in the [[Christianization of Poland]].

[[File:POL województwo kaliskie IRP COA.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|Historical coat of arms of the [[Greater Poland]] region]]
In the [[testament of Bolesław III Krzywousty|testament of Bolesław III Wrymouth]], which initiated the period of fragmentation of Poland (1138–1320), the western part of Greater Poland (including Poznań) was granted to [[Mieszko III the Old]]. The eastern part, with Gniezno and [[Kalisz]], was part of the [[Duchy of Kraków]], granted to [[Władysław II the Exile]]. However, for most of the period the two parts were under a single ruler, and were known as the [[Duchy of Greater Poland]] (although at times there were separately ruled duchies of Poznań, Gniezno, [[Kalisz]] and [[Ujście]]). It was one of the leading and fastest developing regions of Poland, with [[municipal rights]] modeled after Poznań and Kalisz becoming the basis of municipal form of government for several towns in the region, as two of five local Polish variants of medieval town rights. The region came under the control of [[Władysław I the Elbow-High]] in 1314, and thus became part of the reunited Poland of which Władysław was crowned king in 1320.

In the reunited kingdom, and later in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the country came to be divided into administrative units called [[voivodeship]]s. In the case of the Greater Poland region these were [[Poznań Voivodeship (14th century – 1793)|Poznań Voivodeship]] and [[Kalisz Voivodeship (1314–1793)|Kalisz Voivodeship]]. The Commonwealth also had larger subdivisions known as ''[[prowincja]]'', one of which was named [[Greater Poland Province, Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Greater Poland]]. However, this ''prowincja'' covered a larger area than the Greater Poland region itself, also taking in [[Kuyavia]], [[Masovia]] and [[Royal Prussia]]. (This division of [[Crown Poland]] into two entities called Greater and [[Lesser Poland]] had its roots in the [[Statutes of Casimir the Great]] of 1346–1362, where the laws of "Greater Poland" – the northern part of the country – were codified in the [[Piotrków Trybunalski|Piotrków]] statute, with those of "Lesser Poland" in the separate [[Wiślica]] statute.)

[[File:Krainy-historyczne-Polski.png|thumb|Historical regions in Greater Poland Voivodeship and in Poland]]

In 1768, a new [[Gniezno Voivodeship]] was formed out of the northern part of Kalisz Voivodeship. However more far-reaching changes would come with the [[Partitions of Poland]]. In the first partition (1772), northern parts of Greater Poland along the [[Noteć]] (German ''Netze'') were taken over by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], becoming the [[Netze District]]. In the second partition (1793) the whole of Greater Poland was absorbed by Prussia, becoming part of the province of [[South Prussia]]. It remained so in spite of the first [[Greater Poland Uprising (1794)]], part of the unsuccessful [[Kościuszko Uprising]] directed chiefly against the [[Russian Empire]].

More successful was the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1806)|Greater Poland Uprising of 1806]], which led to the region's becoming part of the Napoleonic [[Duchy of Warsaw]] (forming the [[Poznań Department]] and parts of the [[Kalisz Department|Kalisz]] and [[Bydgoszcz Department|Bydgoszcz]] Departments). However, following the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, Greater Poland was again partitioned, with the western part (including Poznań) going to Prussia. The eastern part joined the Russian-controlled [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]], where it formed the [[Kalisz Voivodeship (1975–1998)|Kalisz Voivodeship]] until 1837, then the [[Kalisz Governorate]] (merged into the [[Warsaw Governorate]] between 1844 and 1867).

Within the Prussian empire, western Greater Poland became the [[Grand Duchy of Posen]] (Poznań), which theoretically held some autonomy. Following an unrealized [[Greater Poland Uprising (1846)|uprising in 1846]], and the more substantial but still unsuccessful [[Greater Poland Uprising (1848)|uprising of 1848]] (during the [[Revolutions of 1848|Spring of Nations]]), the Grand Duchy was replaced by the [[Province of Posen]]. The authorities made efforts to [[Germanization|Germanize]] the region, particularly after the founding of Germany in 1871, and from 1886 onwards the [[Prussian Settlement Commission]] was active in increasing German land ownership in formerly Polish areas.

[[File:Powstancy Wlkp.jpg|thumb|left|Soldiers during [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918–1919)|Greater Poland Uprising]] of 1918–19]]
Following the end of World War I, the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918–1919)]] ensured that most of the region became part of the newly independent Polish state, forming most of [[Poznań Voivodeship (1921–1939)]]. Northern and some western parts of Greater Poland remained in Germany, where they formed much of the province of [[Posen-West Prussia]] (1922–1938), whose capital was Schneidemühl ([[Piła]]).

Following the [[German invasion of Poland|German invasion]] of 1939, Greater Poland was incorporated into [[Nazi Germany]], becoming the province called [[Reichsgau Posen]], later Reichsgau Wartheland (''Warthe'' being the German name for the [[Warta]] river). The Polish population was oppressed, with many former officials and others considered potential enemies by the Nazis being imprisoned or executed, including at the notorious [[Fort VII]] concentration camp in Poznań. The Polish population was also subjected to [[Expulsion of Poles by Nazi Germany|expulsions]], [[Kidnapping of children by Nazi Germany|kidnapping of children]] and [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]]. Germany also operated the [[Stalag XXI-A]], [[Stalag XXI-C]], [[Stalag XXI-D]] and other [[German prisoner-of-war camps in World War II|prisoner-of-war camps]] for Polish, French, British, Moroccan, Algerian, Dutch, Belgian, Serbian, Italian, American, Norwegian, and Soviet POWs. Poznań was declared a stronghold city ''([[German World War II strongholds|Festung]])'' in the closing stages of the war, being taken by the [[Red Army]] in the [[Battle of Poznań (1945)|Battle of Poznań]], which ended on 22 February 1945.

After the war, Greater Poland was fully within the [[Polish People's Republic]], as [[Poznań Voivodeship]]. With the reforms of 1975 this was divided into smaller provinces (the voivodeships of [[Kalisz Voivodeship (1975–1998)|Kalisz]], [[Konin Voivodeship|Konin]], [[Leszno Voivodeship|Leszno]] and [[Piła Voivodeship|Piła]], and a smaller Poznań Voivodeship). The present-day Greater Poland Voivodeship, again with Poznań as its capital, was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former [[Poznań Voivodeship|Poznań]], [[Kalisz Voivodeship (1975–1998)|Kalisz]], [[Konin Voivodeship|Konin]], [[Piła Voivodeship|Piła]] and [[Leszno Voivodeship|Leszno]] Voivodeships, pursuant to the [[Polish local government reforms]] adopted in 1998.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://culture.pl/en/article/all-over-the-map-a-quick-tour-of-polands-voivodeships |title=All Over the Map: A Quick Tour of Poland’s Voivodeships |website=culture.pl |author=Marek Kępa |date=30 May 2019 |access-date=22 December 2023}}</ref>

==Geography==
===Topography===
[[File:DB$-54.jpg|thumb|The [[Barycz Valley Landscape Park]]]]
The relief of Greater Poland, geological conditions and soil have been shaped by two glaciations:
* The Baltic glaciation in the lowlands of northern and central Europe where there are now numerous lakes of the Pomeranian Lake District, a feature especially common in and around [[Poznań]] and [[Gniezno]].
* The Mid-glaciation in the southern part of the province, where there is less terrain diversity and a lack of major lakes.

The highest elevation is Greater Kobyla Mountain (284 m) in the Ostrzeszowski Hills, the lowest area is located in the valley of the [[Warta]] River at the mouth of its tributary the [[Noteć]] (21 m) in the north-western part of the region. Agriculturally fertile soils account for around 60% of the province's area, while 20%, the rest of the non-forested or urban areas, is mostly wetland soil (muck-peat and alluvial soils).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://en-ie.topographic-map.com/map-cg351/Greater-Poland-Voivodeship/ |title=Greater Poland Voivodeship topographic map |website=en-ie.topographic-map.com |access-date=22 December 2023}}</ref>

An area of approximately {{Convert|800000|ha}} is covered by forests, this represents around 25.8% of the total surface area of the region.
In the lake districts of the northern and central parts of the province there are about 800 lakes; 58% of which cover an area of at least {{Convert|10|ha}} and 8%, with an area exceeding {{Convert|100|ha}}. The largest reservoir is the natural Greater Powidzkie Lake ({{Cvt|1036|ha}}) in the Gniezno Lake District.

Wielkopolska Region lies within the basin of the [[Oder River]], 88% of the province's surface water drains into the Warta river basin, and the remaining 12% is drained by a multitude of other river systems, including the Barycz, Ladislaus Trench and Obrzycy waterways. The quality of river waters is generally poor, but their condition is gradually improving and should soon be classed as 'clean'.

===Geology===
[[File:Elektrownia Pątnów.jpg|thumb|left|A modern [[Pątnów Power Station|coal-fired power plant in Pątnów]]]]
The main mineral energy resources in Greater Poland are [[lignite]], [[natural gas]], [[petroleum|oil]] and [[peat]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://polskakultura.com/greater-poland-voivodeship-deep-dive-into-the-cradle-of-poland/ |title=Greater Poland Voivodeship: Deep Dive into the Cradle of Poland |website=polskakultura.com |date=1 December 2023 |access-date=22 December 2023}}</ref>

Brown coal deposits are currently mined in the Konin area, and form the basis for the province's power industry (the Pątnów-Adams-Konin [[coal-fired power station]]s account for more than 10% of the national electricity production). The region also has significant quantities of peat deposits; it is calculated that there are ca. {{Convert|886000|ha}} of land covered with an average thickness of {{Cvt|1.5|m}} of peat. An abundance of raw materials used in the production of numerous medicines was recently discovered in the muds of [[Błażejewo, Śrem County|Błażejewo]], [[Oderbank]] and [[Mechnacz]]. In addition, very large deposits of brown coal have been discovered in the vicinity of [[Kościan]], these however are not currently being extracted and probably never will be extracted, due to the expense that would be incurred in adapting the site to build a coal mine and the need to resettle thousands of people.

[[Rock salt]] is mined intensively at a salt mine in [[Kłodawa]] (this mine alone accounts for about 20% of domestic production).

Throughout the province there are significant deposits of aggregates, gypsum, ceramic materials, and lacustrine chalk. In [[Kościan]] the largest and most modern, a natural gas production site is in operation. It supplies raw material for Kościańska Zieme, and Zielona Gora CHP. It is estimated that at the rate local gas reserves are being exploited, the reserves in Kościan will be enough for about 20 years of operation, thus practically allowing for local independence against the effects of gas crises.

===Climate===
Wielkopolska is influenced by oceanic air masses that affect the mildness of the climate. The farther east one travels the more distinctly continental the climate becomes. The area is situated in the Silesian Greater Poland agro-climatic region where the average annual temperature is about 8.2&nbsp;°C, and in the north drops to around 7.6&nbsp;°C. It is slightly warmer in the south and west where the average temperature is usually about 8.5&nbsp;°C. The number of days with snow can reach up to 57 days in and around the [[Kalisz]] district.

The growing season is one of the longest in Poland. On the province's southern plains this season constitutes around 228 days, while north of Gniezno and [[Szamotuły]] this gradually declines to 216 days.

Precipitation ranges from 500 to 550&nbsp;mm. Despite this the region is still faced with a deficit in rainfall, particularly in the eastern part of the province (around Słupcy, Kazimierz Biskupi, Kleczew) where sometimes experience only 450&nbsp;mm of rainfall per year, this threatens steppization of the region. Throughout the province there is typically a prevailing westerly wind.

==Transportation==
[[File:4767 Autostrada A2 Greater Poland Voivodeship 2019.JPG|thumb|The [[Autostrada A2 (Poland)|A2 motorway]] traverses the voivodeship.]]
Greater Poland is a major transport hub within [[Poland]]; a great deal of traffic from [[Russia]] and other states of the [[former Soviet Union]] passes through [[Poznań]] and [[Konin]] to reach Germany and other EU member states. To the south runs the international route from [[Gdańsk]] via Poznań and Leszno to [[Prague]] and then to the south of Europe. There is also a major highway in the province, the [[A2 autostrada (Poland)|A2 motorway]], which when completed will run from the western border of Poland with Germany, through Poznań to [[Warsaw]] and then via [[Belarus]] to Moscow.

The main railway hubs located in Greater Poland are Poznań, [[Piła]] and [[Ostrów Wielkopolski]]. [[PKP Intercity]] operate a number of trains a day between Warsaw and Berlin which provide a fast connection for the two cities also to Poznań. This route was the first in Poland, adapted for use by the European high-speed transportation system. The [[Poznań Główny railway station]] is the second busiest railway station in Poland.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wymiana pasażerska na stacjach|url=https://dane.utk.gov.pl/sts/przewozy-pasazerskie/wymiana-pasazerska-na-s/18886,Przewozy-pasazerskie.html|access-date=27 May 2024|website=Portal statystyczny UTK|language=pl|archive-date=8 October 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221008142701/https://dane.utk.gov.pl/sts/przewozy-pasazerskie/wymiana-pasazerska-na-s/18886,Przewozy-pasazerskie.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>
In the near future{{When|date=May 2017}} the government expects to construct a high-speed rail line in the shape of a Y connecting [[Kalisz]] and Poznań from [[Łódź]], Warsaw and [[Wrocław]].

Poznań is the port of arrival for most international travellers as it plays host to [[Poznań-Ławica Airport|Ławica International Airport]], which has recently{{When|date=May 2017}} seen the second-highest passenger growth rate in the country.

== Economy ==
The [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the province was 40.4 billion € in 2018, accounting for 8.1% of Polish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 19,700 € or 65% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 72% of the EU average.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58 |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|website=Eurostat}}</ref>
