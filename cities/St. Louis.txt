The land that became St. Louis had been occupied by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] cultures for thousands of years before [[European colonization of the Americas|European settlement]]. The city was founded on February 14, 1764, by French fur traders [[Gilbert Antoine de St. Maxent]], [[Pierre Laclède]], and [[Auguste Chouteau]].<ref name="Cazorla et al">Cazorla, Frank; Baena, Rose; Polo, David; and Reder Gadow, Marion.

In 1804, the United States acquired St. Louis as part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. In the 19th century, St. Louis developed as a major port on the Mississippi River; from 1870 until the 1920 census, it was the fourth-largest city in the country. It separated from [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]] in 1877, becoming an [[independent city]] and limiting its political boundaries. In 1904, it hosted the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]], also known as the St. Louis World's Fair, and the [[1904 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=History: Physical Growth of the City of St. Louis |publisher=St. Louis City Planning Commission |year=1969}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=A Brief History of St. Louis |url=https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/visit-play/stlouis-history.cfm |access-date=2023-12-10 |website=stlouis-mo.gov |language=en |archive-date=July 26, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230726081313/https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/visit-play/stlouis-history.cfm |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{Main|History of St. Louis before 1762}}
The area that became St. Louis was a center of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Mississippian culture]], which built numerous temple and residential [[Earthwork (archaeology)|earthwork]] [[Mound builder (people)|mounds]] on both sides of the Mississippi River. Their major regional center was at [[Cahokia Mounds]], active from 900 to 1500. Due to numerous major [[earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]] within St. Louis boundaries, the city was nicknamed as the "Mound City". These mounds were mostly demolished during the city's development. Historic Native American tribes in the area encountered by early Europeans included the [[Siouan]]-speaking [[Osage people]], whose territory extended west, and the [[Illiniwek]].

European exploration of the area was first recorded in 1673, when French explorers [[Louis Jolliet]] and [[Jacques Marquette]] traveled through the Mississippi River valley. Five years later, [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|La Salle]] claimed the region for France as part of [[Louisiana (New France)|La Louisiane]], also known as [[Louisiana]]. The earliest European settlements in the [[Illinois Country]] (also known as Upper Louisiana) were built by the French during the 1690s and early 1700s at [[Cahokia, Illinois|Cahokia]], [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], and [[Fort de Chartres]]. Migrants from the French villages on the east side of the [[Mississippi River]], such as Kaskaskia,  also founded [[Ste. Genevieve, Missouri|Ste. Genevieve]] in the 1730s.

In 1764, after France lost the [[Seven Years' War]], [[Pierre Laclède]] and his stepson [[Auguste Chouteau]] founded what was to become the city of St. Louis.<ref>Hoffhaus. (1984). ''Chez Les Canses: Three Centuries at Kawsmouth'', Kansas City: Lowell Press. {{ISBN|0-913504-91-2}}.</ref> (French lands east of the Mississippi had been ceded to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and the lands west of the Mississippi to Spain; Catholic France and Spain were 18th-century allies. [[Louis XV of France]] and [[Charles III of Spain]] were cousins, both from the House of Bourbon.<ref>[[Pacte de Famille#The third Pacte de Famille]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=August 2019}})  The French families built the city's economy on the [[fur trade]] with the Osage, and with more distant tribes along the [[Missouri River]]. The Chouteau brothers gained a monopoly from Spain on the fur trade with [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]. French colonists used [[History of slavery in Missouri|African slaves]] as domestic servants and workers in the city.

During the negotiations for the 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]], French negotiators agreed to transfer France's colonial territories west of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers to [[New Spain]] to compensate for Spanish territorial losses during the war. These areas remained under Spanish control until 1803, when they were transferred to the [[French First Republic]]. During the [[American Revolutionary War]], St. Louis was unsuccessfully attacked by British-allied Native Americans in the 1780 [[Battle of St. Louis]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010223093542/http://www.usgennet.org/usa/mo/county/stlouis/attack.htm ''www.usgennet.org''.] Attack On St. Louis: May 26, 1780.</ref>

===Founding===
{{Main|History of St. Louis (1763–1803)}}
The founding of St. Louis was preceded by a trading business between [[Gilbert Antoine de St. Maxent]] and [[Pierre Laclède|Pierre Laclède (Liguest)]] in late 1763. St. Maxent invested in a Mississippi River expedition led by Laclède, who searched for a location to base the company's fur trading operations. Though [[Ste. Genevieve, Missouri|Ste. Genevieve]] was already established as a trading center, he sought a place less prone to flooding. He found an elevated area overlooking the flood plain of the Mississippi River, not far south from its confluence with the Missouri and Illinois rivers. In addition to having an advantageous natural drainage system, there were nearby forested areas to supply timber and grasslands which could easily be converted for agricultural purposes. Laclède declared that this place "might become, hereafter, one of the finest cities in America". He dispatched his 14-year-old stepson, [[Auguste Chouteau]], to the site, with the support of 30 settlers in February 1764.<ref name="wade3">{{cite book |last1=Wade |first1=Richard C.|title=The Urban Frontier: The Rise of Western Cities, 1790–1830 |date=1959 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-252-06422-4 |pages=3–4|edition=1996 Illini Books}}</ref>

Laclède arrived at the future town site two months later and produced a plan for St. Louis based on the New Orleans street plan. The default block size was 240 by 300 feet, with just three long avenues running parallel to the west bank of the Mississippi. He established a public corridor of 300 feet fronting the river, but later this area was released for private development.<ref name=wade3/>

For the city's first few years, it was not recognized by any governments. Although the settlement was thought to be under the control of the Spanish government, no one asserted any authority over it, and thus St. Louis had no local government. This vacuum led Laclède to assume civil control, and all problems were disposed in public settings, such as communal meetings. In addition, Laclède granted new settlers lots in town and the surrounding countryside. In hindsight, many of these original settlers thought of these first few years as "the golden age of St. Louis".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Van Ravenswaay |first1=Charles |title=St. Louis: An Informal History of the City and Its People, 1764-1865 |date=1991 |publisher=Missouri History Museum |isbn=9780252019159 |pages=26}}</ref> In 1763, the Native Americans in the region around St. Louis began expressing dissatisfaction with the victorious British, objecting to their refusal to continue to the French tradition of supplying gifts to Natives. Odawa chieftain [[Pontiac (Odawa leader)|Pontiac]] began forming a pan-tribal alliance to counter British control over the region but received little support from the indigenous residents of St. Louis. By 1765, the city began receiving visits from representatives of the British, French, and Spanish governments.

St. Louis was transferred to the [[French First Republic]] in 1800 (although all of the colonial lands continued to be administered by Spanish officials), then sold by the French to the U.S. in 1803 as part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. St. Louis became the capital of, and gateway to, the new territory. Shortly after [[Three Flags Day|the official transfer of authority]] was made, the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] was commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson. The expedition departed from St. Louis in May 1804 along the Missouri River to explore the vast territory. There were hopes of finding a water route to the Pacific Ocean, but the party had to go overland in the Upper West. They reached the Pacific Ocean via the Columbia River in summer 1805. They returned, reaching St. Louis on September 23, 1806. Both Lewis and Clark lived in St. Louis after the expedition. Many other explorers, settlers, and trappers (such as [[Ashley's Hundred]]) would later take a similar route to the West.

The city elected its first municipal legislators (called trustees) in 1808. [[Steamboat]]s first arrived in St. Louis in 1817, improving connections with [[New Orleans]] and eastern markets. Missouri was admitted as a state in 1821. St. Louis was incorporated as a city in 1822, and continued to develop largely due to its busy [[port]] and trade connections.

[[File:St. Louis, Mo. tornado May 27, 1896 south broadway.JPG|thumb|South Broadway had a tornado on May 27, 1896.]]
Immigrants from Ireland and Germany arrived in St. Louis in significant numbers starting in the 1840s, and the population of St. Louis grew from less than 20,000 inhabitants in 1840, to 77,860 in 1850, to more than 160,000 by 1860. By the mid-1800s, St. Louis had a greater population than New Orleans.

Settled by many Southerners in a [[Free and slave states|slave state]], the city was split in political sympathies and became polarized during the [[American Civil War]]. In 1861, 28 civilians were killed in a [[Camp Jackson Affair|clash with Union troops]]. The war hurt St. Louis economically, due to the [[Union blockade]] of river traffic to the south on the Mississippi River. The [[St. Louis Arsenal]] constructed [[ironclad]]s for the [[Union Navy]].

[[History of slavery in Missouri|Slaves]] worked in many jobs on the waterfront and on the riverboats. Given the city's location close to the [[Free and slave states|free state]] of Illinois and others, some slaves escaped to freedom. Others, especially women with children, sued in court in [[freedom suits]], and several prominent local attorneys aided slaves in these suits. About half the slaves achieved freedom in hundreds of suits before the American Civil War.
The printing press of abolitionist [[Elijah Parish Lovejoy]] was destroyed for the third time by townsfolk. He was murdered the next year in nearby [[Alton, Illinois]].

After the war, St. Louis profited via trade with the West, aided by the 1874 completion of the [[Eads Bridge]], named for its design engineer. Industrial developments on both banks of the river were linked by the bridge, the second in the Midwest over the Mississippi River after the Hennepin Avenue Bridge in Minneapolis. The bridge connects St. Louis, Missouri to [[East St. Louis, Illinois]]. The Eads Bridge became a symbolic image of the city of St. Louis, from the time of its erection until 1965 when the [[Gateway Arch]] Bridge was constructed. The bridge crosses the St. Louis riverfront between Laclede's Landing, to the north, and the grounds of the Gateway Arch, to the south. Today the road deck has been restored, allowing vehicular and pedestrian traffic to cross the river. The St. Louis MetroLink light rail system has used the rail deck since 1993. An estimated 8,500 vehicles pass through it daily.

On August 22, 1876, the city of St. Louis voted to [[urban secession|secede]] from [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]] and become an independent city, and, following a recount of the votes in November, officially did so in March 1877.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.stlmag.com/news/politics/st-louis-great-divorce-history-city-county-split-attempt-to-get-back-together/ |title=St. Louis' Great Divorce: A complete history of the city and county separation and attempts to get back together |date=March 8, 2019 |last=Cooperman |first=Jeannette |website=[[St. Louis Magazine]] |access-date=April 8, 2021 |archive-date=April 20, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210420161447/https://www.stlmag.com/news/politics/st-louis-great-divorce-history-city-county-split-attempt-to-get-back-together/ |url-status=live}}</ref> The [[1877 St. Louis general strike]] caused significant upheaval, in a fight for the eight-hour day and the banning of child labor.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McCabe |first1=James Dabney |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=auNCAAAAIAAJ |title=The History of the Great Riots: The Strikes and Riots on the Various Railroads of the United States and in the Mining Regions Together with a Full History of the Molly Maguires |last2=Winslow |first2=Edward Martin |year=1877 |location=[[Philadelphia]] |publisher=National Publishing Company|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124212529/https://books.google.com/books?id=auNCAAAAIAAJ |archive-date=November 24, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>{{pn|date=April 2024}}

Industrial production continued to increase during the late 19th century. Major corporations such as the [[Anheuser-Busch]] brewery, [[Ralston Purina]] company and [[Desloge Consolidated Lead Company]] were established at St. Louis which was also home to several [[brass era]] automobile companies, including the [[Success Automobile Manufacturing Company]];<ref>Clymer, Floyd.

After the Civil War, social and racial discrimination in housing and employment were common in St. Louis. In 1916, during the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow Era]], St. Louis passed a residential segregation ordinance<ref>Primm, James. ''Lion of the Valley: St. Louis, Missouri, 1764-1980''.

In the first part of the century, St. Louis had some of the worst [[air pollution in the United States]]. In April 1940, the city banned the use of soft coal mined in nearby states. The city hired inspectors to ensure that only [[anthracite]] was burned.

St. Louis, like many [[Midwestern]] cities, expanded in the early 20th century due to industrialization, which provided jobs to new generations of immigrants and migrants from the South.

During the 19th and 20th century, most major cities aggressively annexed surrounding areas as residential development occurred away from the central city; however, St. Louis was unable to do so.{{cn|date=June 2024}}

Several [[urban renewal]] projects were built in the 1950s, as the city worked to replace old and substandard housing. Some of these were poorly designed and resulted in problems. One prominent example, [[Pruitt–Igoe]], became a symbol of failure in public housing, and was torn down less than two decades after it was built.

Since the 1980s, several revitalization efforts have focused on [[Downtown St. Louis]].

The architecture of St. Louis exhibits a variety of commercial, residential, and monumental [[architecture]]. St. Louis is known for the [[Gateway Arch]], the tallest [[monument]] constructed in the United States at {{convert|630|ft|m}}.<ref name="huffingtonpost.com">{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/21/st-louis-reasons-to-love_n_4993763.html |work=Huffington Post |first=Marcos |last=Saldivar |title=26 Reasons St. Louis Is America's Hidden Gem |access-date=March 24, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324041004/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/21/st-louis-reasons-to-love_n_4993763.html |archive-date=March 24, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> The Arch pays homage to [[Thomas Jefferson]] and St. Louis's position as the gateway to the West. Architectural influences reflected in the area include [[French Colonial]], [[Architecture of Germany|German]], [[Architecture of the United States|early American]], and [[Modern architecture|modern architectural]] styles.

Several examples of religious structures are extant from the pre-Civil War period, and most reflect the common residential styles of the time. Among the earliest is the [[Basilica of St. Louis, King of France]] (referred to as the ''Old Cathedral''). The Basilica was built between 1831 and 1834 in the Federal style. Other religious buildings from the period include SS. Cyril and Methodius Church (1857) in the Romanesque Revival style and [[Christ Church Cathedral (St. Louis, Missouri)|Christ Church Cathedral]] (completed in 1867, designed in 1859) in the Gothic Revival style.

A few civic buildings were constructed during the early 19th century. The original St. Louis courthouse was built in 1826 and featured a Federal style stone facade with a rounded portico. However, this courthouse was replaced during renovation and expansion of the building in the 1850s. The [[Old Courthouse (St. Louis, Missouri)|Old St. Louis County Courthouse]] (known as the ''Old Courthouse'') was completed in 1864 and was notable for having a [[cast iron]] dome and for being the tallest structure in Missouri until 1894. Finally, a customs house was constructed in the Greek Revival style in 1852, but was demolished and replaced in 1873 by the [[United States Customhouse and Post Office (St. Louis, Missouri)|U.S. Customhouse and Post Office]].

Because much of the city's commercial and industrial development was centered along the riverfront, many pre-Civil War buildings were demolished during construction of the Gateway Arch. The city's remaining architectural heritage of the era includes a multi-block district of cobblestone streets and brick and cast-iron warehouses called [[Laclede's Landing]]. Now popular for its restaurants and nightclubs, the district is located north of Gateway Arch along the riverfront. Other industrial buildings from the era include some portions of the [[Anheuser–Busch#St. Louis headquarters and brewery|Anheuser-Busch Brewery]], which date to the 1860s.

St. Louis saw a vast expansion in variety and number of religious buildings during the late 19th century and early 20th century. The largest and most ornate of these is the [[Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis]], designed by [[Thomas P. Barnett]] and constructed between 1907 and 1914 in the [[Neo-Byzantine]] style. The St. Louis Cathedral, as it is known, has one of the largest mosaic collections in the world. Another landmark in religious architecture of St. Louis is the [[St. Stanislaus Kostka Church (St. Louis, Missouri)|St. Stanislaus Kostka]], which is an example of the [[Polish Cathedral style]]. Among the other major designs of the period were [[St. Alphonsus Catholic Church, St. Louis|St. Alphonsus Liguori]] (known as ''The Rock Church'') (1867) in the Gothic Revival and [[Second Presbyterian Church (St. Louis, Missouri)|Second Presbyterian Church of St. Louis]] (1900) in [[Richardsonian Romanesque]].

By the [[United States Census, 1900|1900 census]], St. Louis was the fourth largest city in the country. In 1904, the city hosted a [[world's fair]] at [[Forest Park (St. Louis, Missouri)|Forest Park]] called the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]]. Its architectural legacy is somewhat scattered. Among the fair-related cultural institutions in the park are the [[Saint Louis Art Museum|St. Louis Art Museum]] designed by [[Cass Gilbert]], part of the remaining lagoon at the foot of Art Hill, and the Flight Cage at the [[St. Louis Zoo]]. The [[Missouri History Museum]] was built afterward, with the profit from the fair. But 1904 left other assets to the city, like [[Theodore Link]]'s 1894 [[St. Louis Union Station]], and an improved Forest Park.

[[One US Bank Plaza]], the local headquarters for [[US Bancorp]], was constructed in 1976 in the [[structural expressionist]] style. Several notable [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]] commercial skyscrapers were built downtown in the 1970s and 1980s, including the [[909 Chestnut Street|former AT&T building at 909 Chestnut Street]] (1986), and [[One Metropolitan Square]] (1989), which is the tallest building in St. Louis.

During the 1990s, St. Louis saw the construction of the largest United States courthouse by area, the [[Thomas F. Eagleton United States Courthouse]](2000). The Eagleton Courthouse is home to the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri]] and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]]. The most recent high-rise buildings in St. Louis include two residential towers: [[One Hundred Above the Park|One Hundred]] in the Central West End neighborhood and [[Ballpark Village (St. Louis)|One Cardinal Way]] in the Downtown neighborhood.

===Topography===
[[File:St Louis Rivers.png|thumb|Rivers in the St. Louis area]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], St. Louis has a total area of {{convert|66|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|62|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|4.1|sqmi}} (6.2%) is water.<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_29.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|access-date=November 20, 2014|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021170230/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_29.txt|archive-date=October 21, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The city is built on [[Hill|bluffs]] and terraces that rise 100–200 feet above the western banks of the Mississippi River, in the [[Midwestern United States]] just south of the [[Missouri River|Missouri]]-Mississippi [[confluence]]. Much of the area is a fertile and gently rolling prairie that features low hills and broad, shallow valleys. Both the Mississippi River and the Missouri River have cut large valleys with wide flood plains.

[[Limestone]] and [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]] of the [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]] [[geologic time scale|epoch]] underlie the area, and parts of the city are [[karst]] in nature. This is particularly true of the area south of downtown, which has numerous sinkholes and caves. Most of the caves in the city have been sealed, but many springs are visible along the riverfront. Coal, brick [[clay]], and [[millerite]] ore were once mined in the city. The predominant surface rock, known as ''St. Louis limestone'', is used as [[dimension stone]] and rubble for construction.

Near the southern boundary of the city of St. Louis (separating it from [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]]) is the [[River des Peres]], practically the only river or stream within the city limits that is not entirely underground.<ref>[http://www.rftstl.com/2000-12-06/news/a-sewer-runs-through-it/ St. Louis – News – A Sewer Runs Through It<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311021411/http://www.rftstl.com/2000-12-06/news/a-sewer-runs-through-it/ |date=March 11, 2007}}.</ref> Most of River des Peres was confined to a channel or put underground in the 1920s and early 1930s. The lower section of the river was the site of some of the worst flooding of the [[Great Flood of 1993]].

The city's eastern boundary is the Mississippi River, which separates Missouri from Illinois. The Missouri River forms the northern line of St. Louis County, except for a few areas where the river has changed its course. The [[Meramec River]] forms most of its southern line.

[[File:The Captains' Return statue and Eads Bridge.JPG|thumb|The Captains' Return statue was inundated by the Mississippi River, 2010.]]
The urban area of St. Louis has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa''); however, its [[Greater St. Louis|metropolitan region]] even to the south may present a hot-summer [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa''), which shows the effect of the [[urban heat island]] in the city. The city experiences hot, humid summers and chilly to cold winters. It is subject to both cold Arctic air and hot, humid tropical air from the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. The average annual temperature recorded at nearby [[Lambert–St. Louis International Airport]], is {{convert|57.4|°F|1}}. {{convert|100|and|0|°F|0}} temperatures can be seen on an average 3 and 1 days per year, respectively. Precipitation averages {{convert|41.70|in|mm|sigfig=2}}, but has ranged from {{convert|20.59|in|mm|abbr=on}} in 1953 to {{convert|61.24|in|mm|abbr=on}} in 2015. The highest recorded temperature in St. Louis was {{cvt|115|°F}} on July 14, 1954, and the lowest was {{cvt|-22|°F}} on January 5, 1884.

St. Louis experiences [[thunderstorm]]s 48 days a year on average.<ref name="weatherbase">{{cite web |url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weatherall.php3?s=43427&refer=&units=us |title=Historical Weather for St. Louis, Missouri |access-date=October 15, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916194311/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weatherall.php3?s=43427&refer=&units=us |archive-date=September 16, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Especially in the spring, these storms can often be severe, with high winds, large [[hail]] and tornadoes. Lying within the hotbed of [[Tornado Alley]], St. Louis is one of the most frequently tornado-struck metropolitan areas in the U.S. and has an extensive history of [[St. Louis tornado history|damaging tornadoes]]. Severe flooding, such as the [[Great Flood of 1993]], may occur in spring and summer; the (often rapid) melting of thick snow cover upstream on the Missouri or Mississippi Rivers can contribute to springtime flooding.

===Flora and fauna===
[[File:Tower Grove Park Scene 1.jpg|thumb|[[Tower Grove Park]] in spring]]
[[File:Missouri_Botanical_Garden_-_Seiwa-en.JPG|thumb|The [[Missouri Botanical Garden]]]]
Before the founding of the city, the area was mostly prairie and open forest. Native Americans maintained this environment, good for hunting, by burning underbrush. Trees are mainly [[oak]], [[maple]], and [[hickory]], similar to the forests of the nearby [[The Ozarks|Ozarks]]; common understory trees include [[eastern redbud]], [[serviceberry]], and [[flowering dogwood]]. [[Riparian]] areas are forested with mainly [[American sycamore]].

Most of the residential areas of the city are planted with large native shade trees. The largest native forest area is found in Forest Park. In autumn, the changing color of the trees is notable. Most species here are typical of the eastern woodland, although numerous decorative non-native species are found. The most notable invasive species is [[Japanese honeysuckle]], which officials are trying to manage because of its damage to native trees. It is removed from some parks.

Wildlife includes urbanized [[coyote]]s, [[white-tailed deer]], [[eastern gray squirrel]], [[cottontail rabbit]], and the nocturnal [[Virginia opossum]]. Large bird species are abundant in parks and include [[Canada goose]], [[mallard duck]], and [[shorebird]]s, including the [[great egret]] and [[great blue heron]]. [[Gull]]s are common along the Mississippi River; these species follow [[barge]] traffic.

Winter populations of [[bald eagle]]s are along the Mississippi River around the [[Chain of Rocks Bridge]]. The city is on the [[Mississippi Flyway]], used by migrating birds, and has a large variety of small bird species, common to the eastern U.S. The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]], an introduced species, is limited in North America to the counties surrounding St. Louis. The city has special sites for birdwatching of migratory species, including [[Tower Grove Park]].

Common frog species include the [[American toad]] and species of chorus frogs called [[spring peeper]]s, which are found in nearly every pond. Some years have outbreaks of [[cicada]]s or [[ladybug]]s. Mosquitoes, [[no-see-ums]], and houseflies are common insect nuisances, especially in July and August; because of this, windows are almost always fitted with screens. Invasive populations of [[Western honey bee|honeybees]] have declined in recent years. Numerous native species of pollinator insects have recovered to fill their ecological niche, and [[armadillos]] are throughout the St. Louis area.<ref>[http://herald-review.com/news/local/armadillos-finding-st-louis-and-surrounding-area-nice-place-to/article_3b52d19c-433c-53f0-a823-3da7776924ab.html "Warmer weather attracting Armadillos"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20131030095930/http://herald-review.com/news/local/armadillos-finding-st-louis-and-surrounding-area-nice-place-to/article_3b52d19c-433c-53f0-a823-3da7776924ab.html |date=October 30, 2013}}, accessed October 28, 2013</ref>

St. Louis grew slowly until the American Civil War, when industrialization and immigration sparked a boom. Mid-19th century immigrants included many Irish and Germans; later there were immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. In the early 20th century, African American and white migrants came from the South; the former as part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] out of rural areas of the Deep South. Many came from Mississippi and Arkansas. Italians, Serbians, Lebanese, Syrians, and Greeks settled in St. Louis by the late 19th-Century.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/visit-play/stlouis-history.cfm|title=A Brief History of St. Louis|access-date=July 26, 2023|archive-date=July 26, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230726081313/https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/visit-play/stlouis-history.cfm|url-status=live}}</ref>

After years of immigration, migration, and expansion, the city reached its peak population in 1950.

St. Louis has lost 64.0% of its population <!-- 308,626 est. 2017 --> since the [[1950 United States census]]. [[Detroit]], Michigan, and [[Youngstown, Ohio]], are the only other cities that have had population declines of at least 60% in the same time frame. The population of the city of St. Louis has been in decline since the 1950 census; during this period the population of the St. Louis Metropolitan Area, which includes more than one county, has grown every year and continues to do so. A big factor in the decline has been the rapid increase in suburbanization.

According to the [[2010 United States census]], St. Louis had 319,294 people living in 142,057 households, of which 67,488 households were families. The population density was {{convert|5,158.2|/mi2|/km2|disp=preunit|people&nbsp;|people}}. About 24% of the population was 19 or younger, 9% were 20 to 24, 31% were 25 to 44, 25% were 45 to 64, and 11% were 65 or older. The median age was about 34 years.

The African-American population is concentrated in the north side of the city (the area north of Delmar Boulevard is 94.0% black, compared with 35.0% in the central corridor and 26.0% in the south side of St. Louis<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dynamic.stlouis-mo.gov/census/corridor.cfm|title=Census|website=Dynamic.stlouis-mo.gov|access-date=August 10, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170724040727/http://dynamic.stlouis-mo.gov/census/corridor.cfm|archive-date=July 24, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>).

===Bosnian population===
{{see also|History of the Bosnians in St. Louis}}
About fifteen families from Bosnia settled in St. Louis between 1960 and 1970. After the [[Bosnian War]] started in 1992, more Bosnian refugees began arriving and by 2000, tens of thousands of Bosnian refugees settled in St. Louis with the help of Catholic aid societies. Many of them were professionals and skilled workers who had to take any job opportunity to be able to support their families.

Yet another factor when comparing the murder rates of St. Louis and other cities is the manner of drawing municipal boundaries. While many other municipalities have annexed many suburbs, St. Louis has not annexed as much suburban area as most American cities. According to a 2018 estimate, the St. Louis metro area included about 3 million residents and the city included about 300,000 residents. Therefore, the city contains about ten percent of the metro population, a low ratio indicating that the municipal boundaries include only a small part of the metro population.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/upshot/crime-statistics-south-bend-st-louis-misleading.html |last=Asher |first=Jeff |date=December 17, 2019 |title=South Bend and St. Louis, Where Crime Statistics Can Mislead |access-date=July 14, 2020 |newspaper=The New York Times |archive-date=September 13, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200913002557/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/upshot/crime-statistics-south-bend-st-louis-misleading.html |url-status=live}}</ref>
