== History ==
The Adoni fort is central to the town's history. In 1780, an observer wrote,
:"Adoni is situated upon three mountains which are united; it has a range of irregular fortifications, piled one over the other. To maintain it requires a garrison of 30,000 men. The fortifications upon the mountains are often weak...To the south of Adoni, a large plain, to the north there are mountains, obnoxious from their nearness, to the east there are other mountains. To the west there are also mountains and this part is the weakest."<ref name="Sen 1995">Sen, S.

It is thought to have been founded by Chandra Sen in 1200 BC and later came into the medieval kingdom of Vijayanagar which flourished from the 14th to the 16th centuries. The fort then became the stronghold of the Muslim kings of the Adil Shahi dynasty of Bijapur and Golconda. In 1690 the fort was taken by Aurangzeb then in the late 18th century it came to the Raja of Mysore, Tipu Sultan before it was ceded to the British in 1799.
In the 15th century and early to mid 16th century, Adoni was a fort town of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. It was controlled by the kinsmen of [[Aliya Rama Raya]], a powerful aristocrat of the Vijayanagara.<ref>Stein, B.
