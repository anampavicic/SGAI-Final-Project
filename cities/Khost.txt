'''Khōst''' ({{lang-ps|خوست}}) is the capital of [[Khost Province]] in [[Afghanistan]]. It is the largest city in the southeastern part of the country, and also the largest in the region of [[Loya Paktia]]. To the south and east of Khost lie [[Waziristan]] and [[Kurram Agency|Kurram]] in [[Pakistan]]. Khost is the home of [[Shaikh Zayed University]]. The [[Khost Airport]] is located in the [[Eastern Area Command (RAAF)|eastern area]] of the city.

==Geography==
{{Further|Geography of Afghanistan}}
Khost is located about 150 kilometres south of [[Kabul]]. Khost lies on a plateau not below {{convert|1000|m|ft|-2}} in elevation that extends to the east for about {{convert|40|km|mi|0}} until the Pakistan border. Thirty kilometres, to the north the peaks rise up to {{convert|2500|to|3000|m|ft|-2}} while farther south {{convert|20|km|mi|0}} away from the border, the average is around 1,800 m.

===Climate===
Khost has a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSk'' though very close to qualifying as ''BSh''). Khost is located in the "Khost Bowl", a valley with lower elevation than the surrounding highlands. The geography afforded more moderate weather conditions. With a January average of {{convert|4.8|C|F|1}}, Khost has noticeably milder winters, compared to the much harsher and snowy winters of the surrounding higher [[Town|towns]] to the north, west, and south (listed anticlockwise): [[Parachinar]], [[Tari Mangal]], [[Aryob]], [[Tsamkani]], [[Khandkhel]], [[Gardez]], [[Zurmat]], [[Sharana]], [[Zerok]], [[Urgun]], [[Angur Ada]], [[Kaniguram]], and [[Razmak]]. Nonetheless, [[frost]]s are still frequent in the early mornings.

Most unusually for Afghanistan, Khost receives a substantial proportion of its annual rainfall of {{convert|475|mm|in|0}} from the South Asian [[monsoon]]. The valley being open to the southeast (towards the lower elevation [[Miranshah]]), the moisture-laden winds bring much welcomed rain during the summer. The remaining portion of the year Khost remains hot and dry. Sporadic [[drought]]s occur when the summer monsoon fails to bring the needed precipitation.

===Land use===
Khost is the provincial administrative seat in eastern Afghanistan. Being close to the border with Pakistan, Khost straddles an important transport corridor. The eastern districts (1–3) are dotted with forests and residential settlements while the western districts (4–5) are more barren and lightly populated.<ref>{{cite web|title=The State of Afghan Cities report 2015|url=http://unhabitat.org/books/soac2015_volume2/|ref=UN-Habitat|access-date=2015-10-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031111658/http://unhabitat.org/books/soac2015_volume2/|archive-date=2015-10-31|url-status=dead}}</ref> Water courses account for 5% of total land surface.<ref>{{cite web|title=The State of Afghan Cities report 2015|url=http://unhabitat.org/books/soac2015_volume2/|ref=UN-Habitat|access-date=2015-10-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031111658/http://unhabitat.org/books/soac2015_volume2/|archive-date=2015-10-31|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==History==
{{History of Afghanistan}}
{{Further|History of Afghanistan}}
=== 19th and 20th centuries ===

During the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]], British forces led by [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] entered Khost during the second British invasion of [[Emirate of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] during the conflict. Approximately 8,000 [[Raid (military)|raiders]] from the [[Mangal (Pashtun tribe)|Mangal tribe]], which had a long tradition of resisting outside control, launched several attacks on weakly protected British supply [[convoy]]s in Khost. In [[reprisal]], Lord Roberts ordered his forces to attack eleven Mangal villages which had launched raids that murdered several [[camp follower]]s, resulting in them being sacked and burnt. Once news of the reprisals became known in Britain, his political opponents in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] criticized Lord Roberts' actions. At the end of the conflict, British forces withdrew from Khost.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Ghost of Khost: What History Might Tell Us about the Future of Afghanistan > Air University (AU) > Journal of Indo-Pacific Affairs Article Display |url=https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/JIPA/Display/Article/2891284/the-ghost-of-khost-what-history-might-tell-us-about-the-future-of-afghanistan/ |access-date=2022-03-25 |website=www.airuniversity.af.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k647AwAAQBAJ&dq=khost+1880&pg=PT43 | isbn=9780752492551 | title=Battle Story: Maiwand 1880 | date=March 2013 | publisher=The History Press }}</ref>

==== [[Khost]] rebellions ====
{{Main|Khost rebellion (1856–1857)|Khost rebellion (1912)|Khost rebellion (1924–1925)}}
Between 1856 and 1925, Khost was the site of three rebellions, lasting from 1856 to 1857, 1912, and 1924–1925 respectively. 

During the [[Soviet–Afghan War]], Khost was the object of a siege that lasted for more than eight years. Soon after the invasion of Afghanistan by [[Red Army|Soviet troops]], Afghan [[Afghan mujahideen#Afghanistan|guerillas]] took control of the only land route between Khost and Gardez, effectively putting a stop to the Soviet advance.

During the assault on the Zhawar Kili Cave complex, the Soviets used the [[Khost Airfield]] as an initial staging ground to insert troops into the combat zone, using [[Mil Mi-8]] armed helicopter transport ships.

As of April 1995, Khost was under the control of the [[Taliban]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6ad3ac.html|title=Refworld {{pipe}} Afghanistan: Background information on the Taliban movement}}</ref>

===21st century===
{{Further|Forward Operating Base Chapman}}
[[File:Main business area of Khost City.jpg|thumb|A business centre in the town centre under construction in 2007]]
During the [[war in Afghanistan (2001–2021)]], the United States built [[Forward Operating Base Chapman]] near Khost. Due to its location in southeastern Afghanistan, it was a hotbed for [[Taliban insurgency|insurgent]] activity attempting to dislodge the American forces there. Like most other provinces, Khost is home to maneuver forces and a [[Provincial Reconstruction Team]] (PRT). Maneuver forces wage war against insurgents and assist the [[Afghan National Army]] and the [[Afghan National Police]] in operations, while the PRT handles the reconstruction aspects.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In early 2007, [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Scottie Custer of the [[82nd Airborne Division]] saw that the best way to limit insurgent activity in Khost was to forward-deploy some 187 [[Paratrooper#United States|paratroopers]] under his command to Force Protection Facilities in Khost's various district centers around sub-governors' mansions, to directly protect these, maintain a visible presence in population centers, and help mentor Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police units operating across Khost.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}

The FPFs brought a broader sense of security and prosperity to surrounding areas.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}} Bazaars, shops, and gas stations have improved the quality of life for local residents. The [[Mandozayi District|Mandozai]] Force Protection Facilities in Khost include a [[medical clinic]] attached to further assist Afghans in need of basic medical assistance. The offices of Khost's various sub-governors had experienced an increased activity as Afghans went there to settle disputes and voice concerns instead of going through traditional tribal channels and bribes, cutting down on sectarian suspicion and strife.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}

Throughout 2007 and 2008, roads had been improved, businesses were springing up and schools were being built, at least 50 in 2007 alone with another 25 planned for 2008. A new airport was under construction as the Khost Airfield was used by the [[United States armed forces|US Military]], creating new opportunities and jobs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}} The [[Provincial Reconstruction Team]], led by CDR [[Dave Adams (United States Navy)|David Adams]] was instrumental in connecting the people to the government in Khost City, by ensuring the [[Provincial Reconstruction Team|PRT]] was able to execute over $2.5 million under the Commanders Emergency Response Program (CERP).{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}

On 12 May 2009, several teams of armed militants stormed Khost, prompting a heavy 6-hour battle with US and Afghan National Army forces. Reportedly the attack involved 10 [[Suicide Bomber|suicide bombers]], of whom seven were able to detonate and three were shot by security forces. Coalition Forces, aided by the Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police, took the lead in repelling the attack.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}

On 20 November 2009 a bomb killed 3 civilians and wounded 3 others as a car hit a roadside bomb in Khost City. According to the chief of criminal investigation the act was perpetrated by the Taliban.<ref>"Roadside bomb kills 3 civilians, wound 3 in E Afghanistan " 20 November 2009. Xinhua News. Khost.

On 15 August 2021, Khost was seized by [[Taliban]] fighters, becoming the twenty-eighth provincial capital to be captured by the Taliban as part of the wider [[2021 Taliban offensive]].

At least 29 people died in Khost during the [[June 2022 Afghanistan earthquake]].<ref>{{cite news |date=2022-06-22 |title=Afghan Earthquake: Officials Say Transfer of the Wounded Challenging |url=https://tolonews.com/afghanistan-178604 |access-date=2023-02-15 |website=TOLOnews |language=en}}</ref>
