'''Kendari''' is the capital city of the [[Indonesia]]n province of [[Southeast Sulawesi]]. It had a population of 289,966 at the 2010 Census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 345,107 at the 2020 census,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> making it the most populous city in the province, and the fourth most on [[Sulawesi]]. The official estimate as at mid 2023 was 351,085 - comprising 176,279 males and 174,806 females.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Kendari Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.7471)</ref> The city covers an area of {{convert|270.14|km2|sp=us}}, or about 0.7 percent of Southeast Sulawesi's land area.
Located on Kendari Bay, it continues to be an important trade center, with the province's main port and airport. It is the economic and educational center of the province, home to various universities and colleges. Kendari has the highest [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) in Sulawesi.<ref>{{Cite web |title=[Metode Baru] Indeks Pembangunan Manusia 2020-2021|trans-title=[New Method] Human Development Index 2020-2021|url=https://www.bps.go.id/indicator/26/413/1/-metode-baru-indeks-pembangunan-manusia.html|language=id|access-date=13 July 2022 |publisher=[[Statistics Indonesia]]}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Cleanup rewrite|Needs to be about the city's history, not the region's|section|date=July 2022}}

=== Etymology ===
The word ''"Kendari"'' is thought to come from a version of the word ''"Kandai"'', meaning a tool made of bamboo and wooden planks to push boats away from a dock. Over time, the pronunciation changed, and the city is now officially known as Kendari.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title=Sejarah Kota Kendari|trans-title=Kendari City History |url=https://www.kendarikota.go.id/page/detail/sejarah-kota-kendari|language=id|access-date=July 13, 2022|publisher=City of Kendari}}</ref>

=== Early history ===
The Bay of Kendari has been known since the 15th century and appears on Portuguese chartered maps, marked with the name "''Citta dela Baia''" ("City of the Bay"). The bay was known as "''Baia du Tivora''" ("Tivora Bay").<ref name=":0" /> The Kingdom of [[Konawe Regency|Konawe]], founded in the fifth century by the Tolaki people, ruled the settlement. Its early governmental structure was simple and resembled those of tribal societies. The kingdom had several historical periods.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last=Hakim |first=Ramlah |title=Lingkar Rotan Kalosara: Perjumpaan Islam Dan Tradisi Dalam Sejarah Islam Konawe |date=2011-06-01 |url=http://jurnalalqalam.or.id/index.php/Alqalam/article/view/96 |journal=Al-Qalam |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=39–49 |doi=10.31969/alq.v17i1.96 |issn=2540-895X|doi-access=free }}</ref>{{rp|42}}

Its first king was Mokole Roro, who ruled the kingdom between 428 and 447, in a period known as Ancient Konawe. The kingdom was still small and did not yet rule all of today's Konawe region or Kendari city. The kingdom's capital was in Rahambuu, a town known today as Unaaha, around {{convert|60|km|sp=us}} from Kendari. The kingdom included three smaller kingdoms loyal to Unaaha.<ref name=":1" />{{rp|42}}

The Old Konawe period followed the Ancient Konawe period. It was marked by the unification and consolidation of the kingdom's power over the region. There was a huge unknown disaster, which is thought to have almost eliminated all the people in the region. According to local legend, ''Onggodo'', a holy man, is thought to have arrived in the kingdom from the [[Maluku Islands]]. He is believed to have saved the kingdom from the unknown disaster, and later married one of the kingdom's princesses. Konawe society was divided into three classes. ''Anakia'' were nobles and the upper classes; ''Tononggapa'' were the commoners and peasants, and ''Oata'' were slaves.<ref name=":1" />{{rp|42–43}} People in the region were united by the ''Kalo Sara'', meaning "circle of tribal laws", a religious symbol of harmony, peace, and kinship, a large bracelet made of three [[rattan]] pieces tied together on a white napkin.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Yahya, M.|author2=dan Subair, M.|date=November 2019|title=Prakarsa Bugis-Mandar dalam Pendidikan Keagamaan di Lalowura Loea Kolaka Timur Sulawesi Tenggara|trans-title=Bugis-Mandar Initiative in Religious Education in Lalowura Loea Kolaka, East Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi|url=https://blamakassar.e-journal.id/pusaka/article/view/260/198|journal=Pusaka|volume=7|issue=2|pages=155|language=id|doi=10.31969/pusaka.v7i2.260|issn=2337-5957|doi-access=free|access-date=July 13, 2022}}</ref><ref name=":1" />{{rp|45}} The rattan bracelet symbolized unity and the white napkin symbolized good deeds.

=== Islamic period ===
Islam has been present in the kingdom since the early 15th century, especially after the foundation of the neighbouring [[Sultanate of Buton]], just south of Konawe, brought by Buginese merchants from [[Makassar]] who mostly settled in coastal regions, and through trade. The kingdom officially embraced Islam during the reign of King Lakidende (1724–1786), who had embraced Islam after traveling around Western parts of Sulawesi and studying Islam in the Bone kingdom around today's [[South Sulawesi]]. During his reign, the kingdom banned things that were considered un-Islamic, such as eating pork. He promoted the construction of mosques in each village, and marriage in accordance with Islamic tradition. The kingdom's governance structure did not change significantly, and many animist traditions were incorporated with Islamic beliefs by the people. The Kalo Sara symbol was interpreted in accordance with Islamic beliefs instead of being abandoned altogether. During this period, Konawe became a multicultural society, with merchants from [[Java]], Makassar, and [[Maluku (province)|Maluku]] settling on the island.<ref name=":1" />{{rp|45–48}}

=== Colonial period ===
[[File:Boeginesiska hus i Kendari, öst-Celebes. Sulawesi. Indonesien - SMVK - 000253.tif|right|thumb|A house in Kendari, 1920]]
In 1828, the governor of the Dutch East Indies tasked a sailor named Jacques Nicholas Vosmaer with mapping the eastern coast of Sulawesi to find a suitable location for a trading post. The first detailed map of Kendari Bay, renamed Vosmaer Bay in his honor, was published in May 1831.<ref name=":0" /> 
According to reports from Vosmaer in 1839 and another Dutch official named van der Hart in 1853, villages around Kendari Bay where current city is located are settled by Bugis and Bajo traders and fisherman between 10 and 15 years prior to his journey. The bay was an attractive location for migrants that time, due to Konawe's political condition that were relatively stable and peaceful compared to neighbouring kingdoms at that time. Many traders, especially those of the Bugis people, came to Kendari due to the ongoing [[First Bone War|Dutch–Bone War]] between 1824 and 1825. During this time, Konawe was in a weakened state following a succession of crises. In 1858, La Mangu, a noble from Ranome Eto, signed a treaty with the Dutch, as he wished to create a separate kingdom, Laiwoi, independent from Konawe. Laiwoi would be located in Ranome Eto, and its founding was kept secret from Konawe royal council members. Laiwoi existed legally, but did not control any territory, as Konawe maintained its hold on the area. The Dutch promised armed help to create the kingdom on  the condition that the treaty would be kept secret from the people of Konawe until the other Dutch wars in South Sulawesi ended.<ref name=":3">{{cite web|title=Sejarah Perlawanan terhadap Imperialisme dan Kolonialisme di Sulawesi Tenggara|trans-title=History of resistance to imperialism and colonialism in the Southeast Sulawesi region|url=http://repositori.kemdikbud.go.id/12838/1/Sejarah%20perlawanan%20terhadap%20imperialisme%20dan%20kolonialisme%20di%20daerah%20sulawesi%20tenggara.pdf|language=id|publisher=Department of Education and Culture|date=1983–84|access-date=13 July 2022}}</ref>{{rp|39–41}}

In 1905, following the end of the war against the [[Sultanate of Gowa|Gowa Sultanate]], the Dutch turned their attention to the eastern coast of Sulawesi. La Mangu had died by now, but the Dutch maintained the plans to establish Laiwoi, approaching nobles from Ranome Eto with the treaty and finally, naming Saosao as king, increasing tensions with the Konawe nobility. To avoid armed conflict, the Dutch government mediated an agreement. However, Konawe secretly mobilised its troops and established an arms store in Puwilalo. In response, the Dutch attempted, and failed, to negotiate with their leader, Watukila. Finally, the Dutch decided to attack Watukila's troops and invaded the kingdom. In 1908, Dutch troops besieged Puundombi Fort, and Konawe fell.<ref name=":3" />{{rp|44–49}} Laiwoi moved the capital to Kendari; armed resistance to it and the Dutch continued through 1937.<ref name=":3" />{{rp|59}}

=== Japanese occupation and independence ===
{{See also|Battle of Kendari|Kolaka incident}}
Japanese troops occupied the city after the [[Battle of Kendari]] in 1942. The Dutch garrison initially opted for guerilla warfare, but following increased Indonesian nationalist sentiment, and the lack of resistance that followed, the Dutch command ultimately pressed for surrender, which they did on 27&nbsp;March. As in other regions, Japanese troops provided opportunities for Indonesian nationalism to spread in the region, and gave nationalist groups military training.<ref name=":3" /><sup>:60</sup>

One month after the [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence]] in August 1945, youth in the region created a militia headquartered in Kolaka. The PRI (Indonesian Republican Youth) controlled the militia and spread its influence to cities and towns in Southeast Sulawesi, including Kendari. Lasandara, a local administrator for the Dutch, officially supported independence. However, in October, Australian troops entered the region with the [[Netherlands Indies Civil Administration]]. On 19&nbsp;November, a Republican militia clashed with Dutch troops in an event known as the [[Kolaka incident]]. In February 1946, Dutch troops occupied the large cities in the region; guerilla resistance by the Republicans continued until 1948.<ref name=":3" />{{rp|61–64}} The city and the surrounding region became part of the [[State of East Indonesia]], which was incorporated into the newly recognised Indonesian Republic a year later. The city was heavily affected by the [[Darul Islam rebellion]], which started in [[South Sulawesi]] but spread to the eastern coast. Because of the conflict, there were several refugee camps around the city. In 1964, the new province of [[Southeast Sulawesi]] was created with Kendari as its capital city.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Rabani, L.|author2=Purwanto, B.|author3=Margana, S.|title=Politik dan Ekonomi di Dua Kota: Baubau dan Kendari pada tahun 1950-an–1960-a|trans-title=The Politics and Economy in Two Towns: Baubau and Kendari in 1950s-1960s|url=https://e-journal.unair.ac.id/MOZAIK/article/download/15746/pdf|journal=Mozaik Humaniora|volume=20|issue=1|pages=39–56|date=2020|language=id|doi=10.20473/mozaik.v20i1.15746|s2cid=225224424 |doi-access=free}}</ref> In 1978, Kendari gained city status as an administrative city and in 1995 as a ''[[City status in Indonesia#Kotaraya, kotamadya, and kotapraja|kotamadya]]''.<ref name=":0" />

==Geography==
Kendari borders the [[Konawe Regency]] in the north, [[South Konawe Regency]] in the south and west, and Kendari Bay in the east. The city is on the southeastern part of mainland [[Sulawesi]] island; several smaller islands around the bay are within its boundaries. The city's [[topography]] varies from flat to hilly. Coastal areas tend to be flatter, while the northern part of the city is part of the Nipa-Nipa mountain formation, which reaches elevations of approximately {{convert|450|m}}. In general, the city's slopes are less than 25 percent except for those in the north, which in some places exceed 40 percent.<ref name=":6">{{cite web|title=Profil Kota Kendari|url=https://sippa.ciptakarya.pu.go.id/sippa_online/ws_file/dokumen/rpi2jm/DOCRPIJM_5c326f6e0d_BAB%20IIBAB.%20II%20PROFIL%20KOTA%20KENDARI.3.pdf|language=id|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210807191847/https://sippa.ciptakarya.pu.go.id/sippa_online/ws_file/dokumen/rpi2jm/DOCRPIJM_5c326f6e0d_BAB%20IIBAB.%20II%20PROFIL%20KOTA%20KENDARI.3.pdf|archive-date=7 August 2021|access-date=14 July 2022}}</ref>

Soil formations in the city are relatively young, dominated by [[cambisol]]s, which make up around 30 percent of the city's soil. Other formations also exist with less frequency, such as [[alluvium]] and [[podzol]]s, which account for less than eight percent overall. Rivers and coastal areas contain the most abundant alluvium sediments.<ref name=":6" />

=== Climate ===
Kendari has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Af'') with heavy rainfall from December to July and moderate rainfall from August to November. The city's average temperature is {{convert|31|C}}.<ref name=":6" />

The lowest average temperature is usually recorded in August and can be {{convert|21|C}}, while the highest average temperature is observed during November reaching {{convert|32|C}}. The average humidity level is between 81 and 87 percent regardless of the month, and wind speed on average sits between {{convert|6.8|kn}} and {{convert|7.5|kn}} with stronger winds observed in December.<ref name=":6" />

=== Administrative districts ===
At the time of the 2010 census, the city was divided into ten [[List of districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''kecamatan''), but an 11th district (Nambo) was subsequently created from part of Abeli District. All districts are tabulated below with their [[postcode]]s, areas and populations at the 2010 census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and the 2020 census,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> together with the official estimates as at mid 2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Kendari Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.7471)</ref> The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centres, the number of urban [[administrative village|villages]] (''kelurahan'') in each district, and its post codes.
