== Etymology ==
Many of the names of the [[municipalities of Guatemala]] consist of one of two things: the name of a [[Catholic Church|catholic]] [[saint]] to worship the day the city was founded or a description with [[Nahuatl|Náhuatl]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bedell|first=George|year=2011|title=The Nahuatl Language|journal=Language in India|volume=11|issue=11|pages=798–826|via=Communication & Mass Media Complete}}</ref> roots.  These influences are due to the troops in command of [[Pedro de Alvarado]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pedro de Alvarado, conquistador|last=Kelly|first=John Eoghan|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1932|location=Princeton, New Jersey}}</ref> who [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala|invaded the region]] in 1520.
