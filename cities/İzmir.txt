It is the [[List of largest cities and towns in Turkey|third most populous]] city in [[Turkey]], after [[Istanbul]] and [[Ankara]], and the largest [[urban agglomeration]] on the [[Aegean Sea]].

In 2019, the city of İzmir had a population of 2,965,900, while İzmir Province had a total population of 4,367,251.<ref name="tuik-population" /><ref name="izmir-stats" /> Its built-up (or metro) area was home to 3,209,179 inhabitants.

Lying on an advantageous location at the head of a gulf running down in a deep indentation, midway along the western Anatolian coast, İzmir has been one of the principal mercantile cities of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] for much of its history. Until the 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], İzmir had a very large [[Ottoman Greeks|Greek]] population. It hosted the [[1971 Mediterranean Games|Mediterranean Games in 1971]] and the [[2005 Summer Universiade|World University Games (Universiade) in 2005]]. The city participated in Climathon in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/izmir|title=Climathon, iklim, Izmir|access-date=November 16, 2019|archive-date=November 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191116083222/https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/izmir|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Names and etymology ==
[[File:Ephesus_Celsus_Library_Façade.jpg|thumb|right|The ancient city of [[Ephesus]] is in the [[İzmir Province|Province of İzmir]].]]

In ancient Anatolia, the name of a locality called ''Ti-smurna'' is mentioned in some of the Level II tablets from the [[Assyria]]n colony in [[Kültepe]] (first half of the [[2nd millennium BC]]), with the prefix ''ti-'' identifying a proper name, although it is not established with certainty that this name refers to modern-day İzmir.<ref>{{cite book | title = Old Smyrna's 1st Settlement Layer and the Artemis Sanctuary|author= [[Ekrem Akurgal]]|publisher=Turkish Historical Society| year= 1983}}</ref>

The modern name ''İzmir'' is the Turkish rendering of the Greek name ''Smyrna'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|m|ɜːr|n|ə}} {{respell|SMUR|nə}}; {{langx|el|Σμύρνη|Smýrni/Smýrnē}}). In [[Middle Ages|medieval times]], [[Western world|Westerners]] used forms like ''Smire'', ''Zmirra'', ''Esmira'', ''Ismira'', which was rendered as ''İzmir'' into Turkish, originally written as {{lang|ota|ازمير}} with the [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Bosworth |first=Clifford Edmund |date=2007 |title=Historic Cities of the Islamic World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UB4uSVt3ulUC&q=izmir+smirre&pg=PA218 |location=[[Leiden]], [[Boston]] |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]] |page=218 |isbn=978-90-04-15388-2}}</ref>

The region of İzmir was situated on the southern fringes of the Yortan culture in Anatolia's prehistory, knowledge of which is almost entirely drawn from its cemeteries.<ref>{{cite journal |jstor=3642952 |journal=Anatolian Studies |volume=42 |year=1992 |pages=75–78 |title=Preliminary survey and core sampling on the Aegean coast of Turkey |author=K. Lambrianides |publisher=British Institute at Ankara |doi=10.2307/3642952 |s2cid=131663490 }}</ref> In the second half of the 2nd millennium BC, it was in the western end of the extension of the still largely obscure [[Arzawa]] Kingdom, an offshoot and usually a dependency of the [[Hittites]], who themselves spread their direct rule as far as the coast during their Great Kingdom. That the realm of the [[13th century BC]] local [[Luwian]] ruler, who is depicted in the [[Kemalpaşa]] Karabel [[rock carving]] at a distance of only {{convert|50|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from [https://beun50tonu.com/izmir-menemen-gezilecek-yerler-nelerdir/ İzmir] was called the ''Kingdom of Myra'' may also leave grounds for association with the city's name.<ref>{{cite journal |jstor=3643046 |journal=Anatolian Studies |volume=48 |year=1998 |pages=1–31 |title=Tarkasnawa King of Mira |author=J.D.Hawkins |publisher=British Institute at Ankara |doi=10.2307/3643046 |s2cid=178771977 }}</ref>

The latest known rendering in [[Greek language|Greek]] of the city's name is the [[Aeolic Greek]] {{lang|grc|Μύρρα}} ''Mýrrha'', corresponding to the later [[Ionic Greek|Ionian]] and [[Attic Greek|Attic]] {{lang|grc|Σμύρνα}} (''Smýrna'') or {{lang|grc|Σμύρνη}} (''Smýrnē''), both presumably descendants of a [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]] form {{lang|grc-Latn|*Smúrnā}}. Some would see in the city's name a reference to the name of an [[Amazons|Amazon]] called Smyrna said to have seduced [[Theseus]], leading him to name the city in her honor.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Thalassocracies|isbn=978-0-87395-062-6|author= Molly Miller|publisher=[[State University of New York Press]]| year= 1971}}. See also [[Life of Homer (Pseudo-Herodotus)]] and Cadoux.</ref> Others link the name to the ''Myrrha commifera'' shrub, a plant producing the aromatic resin called ''[[myrrh]]'' that is indigenous to the [[Middle East]] and northeastern [[Africa]], which was the city's chief export in antiquity.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T2fPhoU0Y8IC&pg=PA27|title=Patmos Speaks Today|first=John|last=Weston|date=2 May 2018|publisher=Scripture Truth|isbn=9780901860668|via=Google Books}}</ref> The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] took over this name as ''Smyrna'', which is still the name used in [[English language|English]] when referring to the city in pre-Turkish times. In [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] the town's name was {{lang|ota|ازمير}} ''Izmīr''.{{citation needed |date=June 2023}}

In English, the city was called Smyrna into the 20th century. ''Izmir'' (sometimes ''İzmir'') was adopted in [[English language|English]] and most foreign languages after Turkey adopted the Latin alphabet in 1928 and urged other countries to use the city's Turkish name.<ref>For example, Izmir in the [http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/trtoc.html Library of Congress Country Studies (Turkey)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826120009/http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/trtoc.html |date=2009-08-26 }}, by the [http://turkey.usembassy.gov/u.s._consular_agent_in_izmir.html US State Department] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219085316/http://turkey.usembassy.gov/u.s._consular_agent_in_izmir.html |date=2008-12-19 }}, by the UN in [http://untreaty.un.org/unts/120001_144071/14/4/00011318.pdf legal treaty texts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519072511/http://untreaty.un.org/unts/120001_144071/14/4/00011318.pdf |date=2011-05-19 }}, by the [http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/embassies-and-posts/find-an-embassy-overseas/europe/consulate-izmir British Foreign Office] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704111510/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/embassies-and-posts/find-an-embassy-overseas/europe/consulate-izmir |date=2009-07-04 }}, in [http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861677014/izmir.html Encarta] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607070711/http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861677014/Izmir.html |date=2009-06-07 }} (''first listing is Izmir, secondary is İzmir''), in [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/izmir Webster's] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423005801/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/izmir |date=2009-04-23 }}, by the [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7630994.stm BBC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930083143/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7630994.stm |date=2009-09-30 }}, by the [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article1085016.ece London ''Times''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606091937/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article1085016.ece |date=2010-06-06 }}, by [http://weather.cnn.com/weather/forecast.jsp?locCode=LTBJ&zipCode=433856037476 CNN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520012523/http://weather.cnn.com/weather/forecast.jsp?locCode=LTBJ&zipCode=433856037476 |date=2011-05-20 }}, by [https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/borat-a-copycat-former-turkish-celebrity-says-1.592484 CBC], by [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6648945 NPR] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180521204952/https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6648945 |date=2018-05-21 }}, by the [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/13/AR2007051300219.html Washington Post] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171210071841/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/13/AR2007051300219.html |date=2017-12-10 }}.

[[File:Karabel1.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Karabel relief]] of the [[Luwian]] local leader "[[Tarkasnawa]], King of Myra" is near [[Kemalpaşa]], a few kilometres to the east of İzmir.]]

The city is one of the oldest settlements of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] basin. The [[2004 in archaeology|2004]] discovery of [[Yeşilova Höyük]] and the neighboring Yassıtepe, in the small delta of [[River Meles|Meles River]], now the [[Bornova]] plain, reset the starting date of the city's past further back than previously thought. Findings from two seasons of excavations carried out in the Yeşilova Höyük by a team of archaeologists from İzmir's [[Ege University]] indicate three levels, two of which are prehistoric. Level 2 bears traces of early to mid-[[Chalcolithic]], and Level 3 of [[Neolithic]] settlements. These two levels would have been inhabited by the [[indigenous peoples]] of the area, very roughly, between the 7th millennium BC and the 4th millennium BC. As the seashore receded with time, the site was later used as a cemetery. Several graves containing artifacts dating roughly from 3000 BC, and contemporary with the first city of [[Troy]], were found.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.yesilova.ege.edu.tr | title = Yeşilova Höyük excavations | access-date = 2007-02-21 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070223114629/http://yesilova.ege.edu.tr/ | archive-date = 2007-02-23 }}</ref>

The first settlement to have commanded the [[Gulf of İzmir]] as a whole was established on top of Mount [[Yamanlar]], to the northeast of the inner gulf. In connection with the silt brought by the streams which join the sea along the coastline, the settlement to form later the core of "Old Smyrna" was founded on the slopes of the same mountain, on a hill (''then a small peninsula connected to the mainland by a small [[isthmus]]'') in the present-day neighborhood of Tepekule in [[Bayraklı]]. The Bayraklı settlement is thought to have stretched back in time as far as the 3rd millennium BC.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Archaeological findings of the late [[Bronze Age]] show a certain degree of [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] influence in the settlement and the surrounding region, though further excavations of Bronze Age layers are needed to propose Old Smyrna of that time as a Mycenaean settlement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wagner|first1=Ana|title=Carolina Digital Repository – The Ahhiyawa Question: Providing Archaeological Evidence for the interconnection between the Hittites and the Mycenaeans|url=https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/record/uuid:c90815b1-921c-4ea6-8d06-10e3dbde72b4|website=cdr.lib.unc.edu|publisher=University of North Carolina|access-date=26 October 2017|page=14|language=en|quote=In Western Anatolia, both Old-Smyrna and Izmir display a degree of Mycenaean influence,...|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180521205002/https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/record/uuid:c90815b1-921c-4ea6-8d06-10e3dbde72b4|archive-date=21 May 2018}}</ref> In the 13th century BC, however, invasions from the [[Balkans]] (the so-called [[Sea Peoples]]) destroyed Troy VII, and Central and Western Anatolia as a whole fell into what is generally called the period of "Anatolian" and "Greek" [[Greek Dark Ages|Dark Ages]] of the [[Bronze Age collapse]].

At the dawn of İzmir's recorded history, [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] describes "evident tokens" such as "a port called after the name of [[Tantalus]] and a sepulcher of him by no means obscure", corresponding to the city's area and which have been tentatively located to date.<ref>{{cite book|title=The description of Greece, Volume 2, p. 38 |author=Pausanias|author-link=Pausanias (geographer)}}</ref> The term "Old Smyrna" is used to describe the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic Period]] city located at Tepekule, Bayraklı, to make a distinction with the city of Smyrna rebuilt later on the slopes of Mount Pagos (present-day [[Kadifekale]]). The Greek settlement in Old Smyrna is attested by the presence of pottery dating from about [[1000s BC (decade)|1000 BC]] onwards. The most ancient preserved ruins date back to 725–[[700 BC]]. According to [[Herodotus]] the city was founded by [[Aeolians]] and later seized by [[Ionians]].<ref>According to [[Herodotus]], the Ionian seizure of the city from the Aeolians was celebrated deceit that had occurred in the following manner: [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]]ians fleeing internal strife within their Ionian city had taken refuge in Old Smyrna. But soon afterward, these defectors had taken advantage of an opportunity that had presented itself when native [[Aeolis|Aeolian]] Smyrniots had gone outside the city ramparts for a festival in honor of [[Dionysos]], and had taken possession of the city. They forced an agreement upon the former inhabitants, who were obliged to take all their movable assets in the city and leave.</ref> The oldest house discovered in Bayraklı has been dated to 925 and [[900s BC (decade)|900 BC]]. The walls of this well-preserved house ({{convert|2.45|by|4|m|ft|disp=or}}), consisting of one small room typical of the [[Iron Age]], were made of [[mudbrick|sun-dried bricks]] and the roof of the house was made of [[Phragmites|reeds]]. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} A house found in Old Smyrna with two floors and five rooms with a courtyard, built in the second half of the [[7th century BC]], is the oldest known house having so many rooms under its roof. Around that time, people started to build thick, protective [[Defensive wall|rampart]]s made of sun-dried bricks around the city. Smyrna was built on the [[Hippodamian]] system, in which streets run north-south and east-west and intersect at right angles, in a pattern familiar in the [[Near East]] but the earliest example in a western city. The houses all faced south. The most ancient paved streets in the Ionian civilization have also been discovered in ancient Smyrna. {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

[[Homer]], referred to as ''Melesigenes'' meaning "Child of the Meles Brook", is said to have been born in Smyrna in the 7th or [[8th century BC]]. Combined with written evidence, it is generally admitted that [[Smyrna]] and [[Chios]] put forth the strongest arguments in claiming Homer and the main belief is that he was born in [[Ionia]]. The [[River Meles]], still bearing the same name, is located within the city limits, although associations with the Homeric river is subject to controversy.

From the 7th century onwards, Smyrna achieved the identity of a [[city-state]]. About a thousand people lived inside the [[city wall]]s, with others living in nearby villages, where fields, [[olive]] trees, [[vineyard]]s, and the workshops of potters and stonecutters were located. People generally made their living from [[agriculture]] and [[fishing]]. The most important [[sanctuary]] of Old Smyrna was the Temple of [[Athena]], which dates back to 640–580 BC and is partially restored today. Smyrna, by this point, was no longer a small town, but an urban center taking part in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] trade. The city eventually became one of the twelve Ionian cities and was well on its way to becoming a foremost cultural and commercial center in the Mediterranean basin of that period, reaching its peak between 650–545 BC. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==== Lydian rule ====
[[File:Klazomenian sarcophagus Izmir Panorama 2458.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[İzmir Archaeology Museum]] has exhibits from ancient sites like [[Bayraklı]] (ancient Smyrna), [[Ephesus]], [[Pergamon]], [[Miletus]], [[Aphrodisias]], [[Klazomenai|Clazomenae]], [[Teos]], and [[Iasos]].]]

The city's port position near their capital drew the [[Lydians]] to Smyrna. The army of [[Lydia]]'s [[Mermnad dynasty]] conquered the city sometime around 610–600 BC<ref>An earlier siege laid by [[List of Kings of Lydia|Gyges of Lydia]] is recounted by [[Herodotus]] in the form of a story according to which the [[King of Lydia]] would have attacked the city to avenge the ill-treatment received from its inhabitants a certain Manes, a poet and a favorite of the sovereign.</ref> and is reported to have burned and destroyed parts of the city, although recent analyses on the remains in Bayraklı demonstrate that the temple had been in continuous use or was very quickly repaired under the Lydian rule.

==== Persian rule ====
Soon afterwards, an invasion from outside Anatolia by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] effectively ended Old Smyrna's history as an urban center of note. The Persian emperor [[Cyrus the Great]] attacked the coastal cities of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] after conquering [[Sardis|the capital of Lydia]]. As a result, Old Smyrna was destroyed in 545 BC.

====Alexander the Great====
[[Alexander the Great]] re-founded the city at a new location beyond the [[River Meles|Meles River]] around 340 BC. Alexander had defeated the Persians in several battles and finally the Emperor [[Darius III]] himself at [[Battle of Issus|Issus]] in 333 BC. Old Smyrna on a small hill by the sea was large enough only for a few thousand people. Therefore, the slopes of [[Mount Pagos]] ([[Kadifekale]]) were chosen for the foundation of the new city, for which Alexander is credited, and this act laid the ground for a resurgence in the city's population.

==== Roman rule ====

In 133 BC, Eumenes III, the last king of the Attalid dynasty of [[Pergamum]], was about to die without an heir. In his [[will (law)|will]], he [[bequest|bequeathed]] his kingdom to the [[Roman Republic]], and this included Smyrna. The city thus came under Roman rule as a civil [[diocese]] within the [[Province of Asia]] and enjoyed a new period of prosperity. Towards the close of the 1st century AD, Smyrna appeared as one of the [[seven churches of Asia]] (Revelation 2:9). [[John the Apostle|Apostle John]] urged his followers to remain Christians:  "Be faithful to the point of death, and I will give you the crown of life" (Revelation 2:10).

Given the importance of the city, [[Roman emperor]]s who came to [[Anatolia]] also visited Smyrna. In early AD 124, Emperor [[Hadrian]] visited Smyrna on his journeys across the Empire<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/ifa/zpe/downloads/1988/073pdf/073159.pdf |page= 162 |title= Journeys of Hadrian |author= [[Ronald Syme]] |publisher= Dr. Rudolf Hbelt GmbH, [[Bonn]] – [[University of Cologne]] |year= 1998 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070621194552/http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/ifa/zpe/downloads/1988/073pdf/073159.pdf |archive-date= 2007-06-21 }}</ref> and possibly [[Caracalla]] came in 214–215. Smyrna was a fine city with stone-paved streets.

In AD 178, the city was devastated by an [[earthquake]]. Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] contributed greatly to the rebuilding of the city. During this period the [[agora]] was restored. Many of the works of architecture from the city's pre-Turkish period date from this period.

After the [[Roman Empire]] was divided into two distinct entities, Smyrna became a territory of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. The city kept its status as a notable religious center in the early Byzantine period, but never returned to the Roman levels of prosperity.

[[File:Beylik of Aydın 1315-1375.png|thumb|left|[[Aydınids|Beylik of Aydın]] in the 14th century]]

The [[Turkic peoples]] first captured Smyrna under the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]] commander [[Tzachas|Çaka Bey]] in 1076, along with [[Klazomenai]], [[Foça]] and a number of the [[Aegean Islands]]. Çaka Bey (known as ''Tzachas'' among the Byzantines) used İzmir as a base for his naval operations.<ref>[[Anna Komnene]].

Smyrna was captured again in the 14th century by Umur Bey, the son of the founder of the [[Anatolian Turkish Beyliks|Beylik]] of [[Aydinids|Aydın]] who first took the upper fort of Mount Pagos (thereafter called [[Kadifekale]]), and then the lower port castle of Neon Kastron (called St. Peter by the Genoese and as "Ok Kalesi" by the Turks). As [[Tzachas]] had done two centuries before, Umur Bey used the city as a base for naval raids. In 1344, a coalition of forces coordinated by [[Pope Clement VI]] took back the lower castle in a surprise attack in the [[Smyrniote crusades]]. A sixty-year period of uneasy cohabitation between the two powers, the Beyliks holding the upper castle and the Knights the lower, followed by Umur Bey's death in 1348.

=== Ottoman period ===

[[File:Izmir1883.jpg|thumb|The port of İzmir, from an 1883 encyclopedia]]
The upper city of İzmir was captured from its Aydinid rulers by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] for the first time in 1389 during the reign of [[Bayezid I]], who led his armies toward the five Western Anatolian Beyliks in the winter of the same year he had come to the throne. In 1402, however, [[Timur]] ([[Tamerlane]]) won the [[Battle of Ankara]] against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], putting a serious check on the Ottoman state for the two following decades and handing back the territories of most of the Beyliks to their former ruling dynasties. Timur attacked and destroyed Smyrna and was responsible for the massacre of most of the Christian population, which constituted the vast majority in Smyrna.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Ring|editor-first1=Trudy|title=International dictionary of historic places|date=1995|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn|location=Chicago [u.a.]|isbn=9781884964022|page=351 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=74JI2UlcU8AC|quote=Timur... sacked Smyrna and massacred nearly all of its inhabitants}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Foss|first1=Clive|title=Byzantine and Turkish Sardis|year=1976|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674089693|page=93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UfltAAAAMAAJ|language=en|quote=Tamerlane determined to conquer Smyrna... In December 1402, Smyrna was taken and destroyed, its Christian population massacred.}}</ref> In 1415, [[Mehmet I]] took back İzmir for the Ottomans for the second time. With the death of the last bey of Aydın, [[İzmiroğlu Cüneyd Bey]], in 1426 the city passed fully under Ottoman control. İzmir's first Ottoman governor was [[Alexander (son of Ivan Shishman)|Alexander]], a converted son of the [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] [[Shishman dynasty]]. During the campaigns against Cüneyd, the Ottomans were assisted by the forces of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] who pressed the Sultan to return the port castle to them. However, the sultan refused to make this concession, despite the resulting tensions between the two camps, and he gave the Hospitallers permission to build a castle (the present-day [[Bodrum Castle]]) in [[Petronium]] ([[Bodrum]]) instead.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In a landward-looking arrangement somewhat against its nature, the city and its present-day dependencies became an Ottoman [[sanjak]] (''sub-province'') either inside the larger [[vilayet]] (''province'') of Aydın part of the [[eyalet]] of [[Anatolia Province, Ottoman Empire|Anatolia]], with its capital in [[Kütahya]] or in "Cezayir" (i.e. ''"Islands"'' referring to "the [[Aegean Islands]]"). In the 15th century, two notable events for the city were a surprise [[Venice|Venetian]] raid in 1475 and the arrival of [[Sephardic Jews]] from [[Spain]] after 1492; they later made İzmir one of their principal urban centers in Ottoman lands. İzmir may have been a rather sparsely populated place in the 15th and 16th centuries, as indicated by the first extant Ottoman records describing the town dating from 1528. In 1530, 304 adult males, both tax-paying and tax-exempt were on record, 42 of them Christians. There were five urban wards, one of these situated in the immediate vicinity of the port, rather active despite the town's small size and where the non-Muslim population was concentrated. By 1576, İzmir had grown to house 492 taxpayers in eight urban wards and had a number of dependent villages.<ref>Boynuzsekisi village in the same plain as İzmir and inhabited in 1532 by 50 Muslim and 29 non-Muslim families who paid its taxes along with the city was an offshoot of the İzmir founded by city-dwellers according to some sources while the Ottoman records refer to the inhabitants of this village as living here since ''"evvel-kadim" – since times immemorial''. {{cite web |url=http://bliss.mu.edu.tr/tezdb/51008.pdf |title=XVI.

==== International port city ====
İzmir's remarkable growth began in the late 16th century when cotton and other products of the region brought French, English, Dutch and Venetian traders here.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The emergence of İzmir as a major international port by the 17th century was largely a result of the attraction it exercised over foreigners and the city's European orientation.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Ottoman City Between East and West: Aleppo, İzmir and Istanbul|isbn=0-521-64304-X|author1=Edhem Eldem |author2=Daniel Goffman |author3=David Morgan |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]| year= 1999}}</ref> With the privileged trading conditions accorded to foreigners in 1620 (these were the infamous ''[[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire|capitulations]]'' that were later to cause a serious threat and setback for the Ottoman state in its decline), İzmir began to be one of the foremost trade centers of the Empire. Foreign consulates moved from [[Chios]] to the city by the early 17th century (1619 for the French Consulate, 1621 for the British), serving as trade centers for their nations. Each consulate had its own quay, where the ships under their flag would anchor. The long campaign for the conquest of [[Crete]] (22 years between 1648 and 1669) also considerably enhanced İzmir's position within the Ottoman realm since the city served as a port of dispatch and supply for the troops.<ref>{{Cite web|title=İzmir Uçak Bileti|url=https://www.ucuyos.com/icerik-detay/general/ucak-biletleri/80381-izmir-ucak-bileti|access-date=2021-08-28|website=www.ucuyos.com}}</ref> İzmir is also one of the only Ottoman cities [[Flag of İzmir|to have a (maritime) flag]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Alkan |first=Mehmet |date=2020 |title='Tarihte Bayrağı Olan Nadir Şehir: İzmir' |url=https://avesis.istanbul.edu.tr/yayin/29756817-d3be-4881-a37d-11a6cc718b39/tarihte-bayragi-olan-nadir-sehir-izmir |journal=Toplumsal Tarih |issue=315 |issn=1300-7025}}</ref>

Despite facing a plague in 1676, an earthquake in 1688, and a [[List of historic fires|great fire]] in 1743, the city continued to grow. By the end of the 17th century, the population was estimated at around ninety thousand, the Turks forming the majority (about 60,000); there were also 15,000 Greeks, 8,000 Armenians and 6,000 to 7,000 Jews, as well as a considerable section made up of [[France|French]], [[England|English]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[Italy|Italian]] merchants.<ref>{{cite book|title = Historic Cities of the Islamic World, ''İzmir'' pp. 218–221|isbn=978-90-04-15388-2|year=2008 | author= C.

In 1770, the Ottoman fleet was destroyed by Russian forces at the [[Battle of Çeşme]], located near the city.

These new developments, typical of the [[Industrialisation|industrial age]] and the way the city attracted merchants and middlemen gradually changed the demographic structure of the city, its culture and its Ottoman character. In 1867, İzmir finally became the center of its own [[vilayet]], still called by neighboring Aydın's name but with its own administrative area covering a large part of Turkey's present-day [[Aegean Region]].

In the late 19th century, the port was threatened by a build-up of silt in the gulf and an initiative, unique in the history of the Ottoman Empire, was undertaken in 1886. In order to redirect the silt, the bed of the [[Gediz River]] was redirected to its present-day northern course, so that it no longer flowed into the gulf. The beginning of the 20th century saw İzmir take on the look of a global metropolis with a cosmopolitan city center. According to the 1893 Ottoman census, more than half of the population was Turkish, with 133,800 Greeks, 9,200 Armenians, 17,200 Jews, and 54,600 foreign nationals.<ref name="Karpat1985">{{cite book|author=Kemal H.

Following the defeat of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in [[World War I]], the victors had, for a time, intended to carve up large parts of [[Anatolia]] into respective zones of influence and offered the western regions of [[Turkey]] to [[Greece]] under the [[Treaty of Sèvres]]. On 15 May 1919, the [[Greek Army]] [[Occupation of Smyrna|landed in Smyrna]], but the Greek expedition towards central [[Anatolia]] was disastrous for both that country and for the local [[Greek people|Greeks]] of [[Anatolia]]. By September 1922 the Greek army had been defeated and the last Greek soldiers left Smyrna on 8 September 1922.

The [[Turkish Army]] retook possession of the city on 9 September 1922, effectively ending the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)]]. Four days later, on 13 September 1922, a [[Great Fire of Smyrna|great fire broke out]] in the city, lasting until {{awrap|22 September}}.

The war, and especially the events that took place in İzmir, such as the fire, probably the greatest disaster the city has ever experienced, continue to influence the psyches of the two nations to this day. The Turks have claimed that the Greek army landing was marked from the very first day by the "first bullet" fired on Greek detachments by the journalist [[Hasan Tahsin]] and the bayonetting to death of [[Colonel Fethi Bey]] and his unarmed soldiers in the city's historic barracks (''Sarı Kışla — the Yellow Barracks''), for refusing to shout "''Zito o [[Eleftherios Venizelos|Venizelos]]''{{-"}} ("Long Live [[Eleftherios Venizelos|Venizelos]]"). The Greeks, on the other hand, have cited the numerous atrocities committed by the Turkish soldiers against the Greeks and Armenians (locals or hinterland refugees) in İzmir. These include the lynching of the Orthodox Metropolitan [[Chrysostomos of Smyrna|Chrysostomos]] following the recapture of the city on 9 September 1922 and the slaughter of Armenian and Greek males, who were then sent to the so-called [[Labour Battalions (Ottoman Empire)|labour battalions]].<ref>Marjorie H. Dobkin, ''Smyrna 1922: The Destruction of a City'' (London: Faber, 1972; reprint: Kent, OH: Kent State University, 1988).</ref>  The city was, once again, gradually rebuilt after the proclamation of the [[Republic of Turkey|Turkish Republic]] in 1923.

In 2020, the city was damaged by the [[2020 Aegean Sea earthquake|Aegean Sea earthquake and tsunami]], which was the deadliest seismic event of that year. 117 people died and 1,034 more were injured in Turkey, all but one of whom were from the city of İzmir.<ref name="aa.com.tr">{{Cite web|last=Özmen|first=Merve Yıldızalp|date=14 November 2020|title=İzmir'deki depremde can kaybı 116'ya yükseldi|url=https://www.aa.com.tr/tr/turkiye/izmirdeki-depremde-can-kaybi-116ya-yukseldi/2043913|website=Anadolu Agency}}</ref>

The city of İzmir is composed of several [[İzmir Province|metropolitan districts]]. Of these, the district of [[Konak, İzmir|Konak]] corresponds to historical İzmir, with this district's area having constituted the city's central "İzmir Municipality" ({{langx|tr|İzmir Belediyesi|links=no}}) until 1984. With the formation of the "İzmir Metropolitan Municipality" ({{langx|tr|İzmir Büyükşehir Belediyesi|links=no}}), the city of İzmir at first grouped together its eleven (initially nine) [[urban district]]s – namely [[Balçova]], [[Bayraklı]], [[Bornova]], [[Buca]], [[Çiğli]], [[Gaziemir]], [[Güzelbahçe]], [[Karabağlar]], [[Karşıyaka]], [[Konak, İzmir|Konak]], and [[Narlıdere]] – and later consolidated them with an additional nine of the province's districts outside the city proper.<ref>{{cite web|title=Büyükşehir Belediyesi Kanunu 5216|url=https://www.izmir.bel.tr/YuklenenDosyalar/Dokumanlar/23.12.2015%2013_51_41_BuyuksehirYasa2015.pdf|access-date=25 November 2019|publisher=[[İzmir Metropolitan Municipality]]|language=tr}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=2009|title=Projenin Sınırları|url=https://skpo.izmir.bel.tr/Upload_Files/FckFiles/file/Profile/skpo2009/projenin_sinirlari_2009.pdf|access-date=25 November 2019|publisher=[[İzmir Metropolitan Municipality]]|language=tr}}</ref> In 2013, [[2013 Turkish local government reorganisation|the passing of Act 6360]] established all thirty of İzmir Province's districts as part of İzmir's metropolitan area.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kut Görgün|first1=Esra|last2=Yörür|first2=Neriman|date=2017|title=6360 Sayılı Büyükşehir Kanunu Sonrası Kırsal Alanları Yeniden Düşünmek – İzmir Örneği|url=https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/391367|journal=Aydın İktisat Fakültesi Dergisi|language=tr|publisher=Adnan Menderes Üniversitesi|volume=2|issue=1|pages=11–27|access-date=25 November 2019}}</ref>

The period after the 1960s and the 1970s saw another blow to the fabric of İzmir, when local administrations tended to neglect İzmir's traditional values and landmarks. For many inhabitants, this was as serious as the [[Great Fire of Smyrna|1922 fire]]. Some administrators were not always in tune with the central government in [[Ankara]] and regularly fell short of government subsidies, and the city absorbed huge waves of immigration from inland [[Anatolia]], causing a [[Human overpopulation|population explosion]]. Today, it is not surprising that many inhabitants of İzmir (similar to residents of other prominent Turkish cities) look back with nostalgia to a cozier, more manageable city, which came to an end in the last few decades.{{citation needed |date=June 2023}}

The Floor Ownership Law of 1965 (''Kat Mülkiyeti Kanunu''), allowing and encouraging arrangements between house or land proprietors and building contractors by which each would share the benefits of renting out eight-floor apartment blocks built to replace former single-family houses, proved especially disastrous for the urban landscape.{{citation needed |date=June 2023}}

Modern İzmir is growing in several directions at the same time. The north-western corridor extending to [[Aliağa]] brings together both mass housing projects, including villa-type projects and intensive industrial area, including an [[oil refinery]]. In the southern corridor towards [[Gaziemir]] yet another important growth trend is observed, contributed to by the Aegean Free Zone, light industry, the airport and mass housing projects. The presence of the Tahtalı Dam, built to provide drinking water, and its protected zone did not check urban spread here, which has offshoots in cooperatives outside the metropolitan area as far south as the Ayrancılar–[[Torbalı]] axis.{{citation needed |date=June 2023}}

To the east and the north-east, urban development ends near the natural barriers constituted respectively by the Belkahve ([[Mount Nif]]) and Sabuncubeli ([[Mount Yamanlar]]-[[Mount Sipylus]]) passes. But the settlements both above [[Bornova]], inside the metropolitan zone, and around [[Kemalpaşa]] and [[Ulucak]], outside the metropolitan zone, see mass housing and secondary residences development.{{citation needed |date=June 2023}}

More recently, the metropolitan area displays growth, especially along the western corridor, encouraged by the Çeşme motorway and extending to districts outside the city of İzmir proper, such as [[Seferihisar]] and [[Urla, İzmir|Urla]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://library.iyte.edu.tr/tezler/master/sehirplanlama/T000478.pdf | title = Development Trends of Single Family Housing Estates in İzmir Metropolitan Fringe Area | author = Hasibe Velibeyoğlu | publisher = [[İzmir Institute of Technology]] | year = 2004 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110820012101/http://library.iyte.edu.tr/tezler/master/sehirplanlama/T000478.pdf | archive-date = 2011-08-20 }}</ref>

İzmir is also home to Turkey's second largest [[History of the Jews in İzmir|Jewish community]] after Istanbul, numbering about 2,500.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.yeniasir.com.tr/a/dizi/israil/israil1.htm| title = Smyrniots in Israel (1/7)|publisher=The newspaper "Yeni Asır"| access-date=2007-02-21 |language=tr |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070914121036/http://www.yeniasir.com.tr/a/dizi/israil/israil1.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2007-09-14}}</ref> The community is still concentrated in their traditional quarter of [[Karataş, İzmir|Karataş]]. Smyrniot Jews like [[Sabbatai Zevi]] and [[Darío Moreno]] were among famous figures in the city's Jewish community.  Others include the [[Pallache family]] with three grand rabbis: [[Haim Palachi|Haim]], [[Abraham Palacci|Abraham]], and [[Rahamim Nissim Palacci|Nissim]].{{citation needed |date=June 2023}}

[[File:St._John's_Cathedral_(RC),_Izmir.JPG|thumb|[[St. John's Cathedral (İzmir)|St. John's Cathedral]] (1874) is dedicated to [[John the Evangelist]], who wrote the [[Book of Revelation]] and sent the scrolls describing his visions to the [[Seven churches of Asia]], including Smyrna (İzmir).]]

The [[Catholic]] [[Levantine mansions of İzmir|Levantines of İzmir]], who are mostly of [[Genoa|Genoese]] and to a lesser degree of [[French people|French]] and [[Venice|Venetian]] descent,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.levantineheritage.com/histor3.htm|title=History of the community 3|website=www.levantineheritage.com}}</ref> live mainly in the districts of [[Bornova]] and [[Buca]].

İzmir once had a large [[Greeks in Turkey|Greek]] and [[Armenians in Turkey|Armenian]] community, but after the great fire of 1922 and the end of the Greco-Turkish War, many of the [[Greeks]] remaining in the city fled, were killed or forced to leave under the terms of the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey]].{{citation needed |date=June 2023}}

Turkey is home to tens of thousands of [[Black people|black]] citizens descended from the [[Slavery in Africa|African slave trade]] in the Ottoman Empire that can be traced back to the 14th century. Known as [[Afro-Turks]], İzmir and the surrounding areas on the Aegean coast is a central hub for this population.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Yackley |first=Ayla Jean |date=2020-06-23 |title=Afro-Turks join global outcry over George Floyd killing |url=https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2020/06/turkey-united-states-afro-turks-join-outcry-george-floyd.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210801135824/https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2020/06/turkey-united-states-afro-turks-join-outcry-george-floyd.html |archive-date=2021-08-01 |access-date=2023-06-25 |website=Al-Monitor |language=en}}</ref>

== Climate ==
İzmir has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Csa'', [[Trewartha climate classification]]: ''Cshk''), which is characterized by prolonged, very hot, dry summers, and cool, rainy winters. İzmir's average yearly precipitation is quite ample, at {{convert|730.5|mm|in|abbr=on}}; however, the vast majority of the city's rainfall occurs from November through March, and there is usually very little rainfall from June to September, with frequent summer droughts. The city received its greatest daily rainfall, {{convert|145.3|mm|in|abbr=on}}, on September 29, 2006, while the highest wind speed of {{convert|127.1|km/h|abbr=on}} was recorded on March 29, 1970.

Maximum temperatures during the winter months are mostly between {{convert|10|and|16|C|F}}. Although it is rare, snow can fall in İzmir from December to February, which usually stays for a few hours rather than a whole day or more. The record {{convert|32|cm|in|abbr=on}} of snow depth was recorded on January 31, 1945. Frost does occasionally occur at night almost every winter. During summer, the air temperature can climb as high as {{convert|40|C}} from June to September; however, the high temperatures are usually between {{convert|30|and|36|C|F}}.

[[Etesian]] winds ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''meltem'', [[Greek language|Greek]]: μελτέμι ''meltemi'') of the Aegean Sea occur regularly in the [[Gulf of İzmir|Gulf]] and city of İzmir.

Standing on Mount [[Yamanlar]], the tomb of [[Tantalus]] was excavated by [[Félix Marie Charles Texier|Charles Texier]] in 1835 and is an example of the historic traces in the region prior to the [[Hellenistic Age]], along with those found in nearby [[Kemalpaşa]] and [[Mount Sipylus]].

The [[Agora]] of [[Smyrna]] is well preserved, and is arranged into the [[Agora Open Air Museum of İzmir]], although important parts buried under modern buildings wait to be brought to light. Serious consideration is also being given to uncovering the ancient theatre of Smyrna where [[St. Polycarp]] was martyred, buried under an urban zone on the slopes of [[Kadifekale]]. It was distinguishable until the 19th century, as evident by the sketches done at the time. At top of the same hill stands an ancient castle, one of İzmir's landmarks. Other ancient monument include also the Kızılçullu aqueducts in [[Buca]] district.

One of the more pronounced elements of İzmir's harbor is the [[İzmir Clock Tower|Clock Tower]], a marble tower in the middle of the [[Konak, İzmir|Konak]] district, standing {{convert|25|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in height. It was designed by Levantine [[France|French]] architect Raymond Charles Père in 1901 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the ascension of [[Abdülhamid II]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] throne in 1876. The tower features four fountains placed around the base in a circular pattern, and the columns are inspired by North African themes.

The [[Kemeraltı]] bazaar zone set up by the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]], combined with the Agora, rests near the slopes of [[Kadifekale]]. İzmir has had three castles historically – [[Kadifekale]] (''[[Pagos]]''), the portuary Ok Kalesi (''Neon Kastron, St. Peter''), and Sancakkale, which remained vital to İzmir's security for centuries. Sancakkale is situated in the present-day İnciraltı quarter between the [[Balçova]] and [[Narlıdere]] districts, on the southern shore of the Gulf of İzmir. It is at a key point where the strait allows entry into the innermost tip of the Gulf at its narrowest, and due to shallow waters through a large part of this strait, ships have sailed close to the castle.<ref>[[Lord Byron]]'s notes on 8 March 1810 during his travels into the region indicate: "Passed the low fort on the right on a tongue of land – immense cannon mouths with marble balls appearing under the fort walls. Obliged to go close to the Castle, on account of shallows on the other side in [the] large bay of Smyrna."</ref>

There are nine [[synagogues]] in İzmir, concentrated either in the traditional Jewish quarter of [[Karataş, Izmir|Karatas]] or in Havra Sokak (''Synagogue street'') in [[Kemeraltı]], and they all bear the signature of the 19th century when they were built or re-constructed in depth on the basis of former buildings.

[[File:TR Izmir asv2020-02 img37 Karşıyaka monument.jpg|thumb|The [[Atatürk, His Mother and Women's Rights Monument]] in the [[Karşıyaka]] district of İzmir]]

The ''[[Atatürk Mask, İzmir|Atatürk Mask]]'' ({{langx|tr|Atatürk Maskı}}) is a large concrete relief of the head of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], founder of modern [[Turkey]], located to the south of [[Kadifekale]] the historical castle of İzmir.

The İzmir Bird Paradise (''İzmir Kuş Cenneti'') in [[Çiğli]], a bird sanctuary near [[Karşıyaka]], has 205 recorded species of birds, including 63 species that are resident year-round, 54 species of summer migratory birds, 43 species of winter migratory birds, and 30 transient species. 56 species of birds have bred in the park. The sanctuary, which covers 80 square kilometres, was registered as "the [[protected area]] for water birds and for their breeding" by the Turkish Ministry of Forestry in 1982. A large open-air zoo was established in the same district of Çiğli in 2008 under the name Sasalı Park of Natural Life.

=== İzmir International Fair ===
{{Main|İzmir International Fair}}

İzmir prides itself with its busy schedule of [[trade fair]]s, [[art exhibition|exhibitions]] and [[congress]]es. The fair and the festival are held in the compound of İzmir's vast inner city park named [[Kültürpark]] in the first days of September, and organized by İZFAŞ, a depending company of İzmir Metropolitan Municipality.

=== Festivals ===
[[File:Ahmet Adnan Saygun Art Center in Izmir.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Ahmed Adnan Saygun Arts Center]]]]
The annual International İzmir Festival, which begins in mid-June and continues until mid-July, has been organized every year since 1987. During the festival, many world-class performers such as [[Solo (music)|soloist]]s and [[virtuoso|virtuosi]], [[orchestra]]s, dance companies, [[rock music|rock]] and [[jazz]] groups have given recitals and performances at various venues in the city and its surrounding areas; including the ancient theatres at [[Ephesus]] (near [[Selçuk]]) and Metropolis (an ancient [[Ionia]]n city situated near the town of [[Torbalı]].) The festival is a member of the [[European Festivals Association]] since 2003.

The [[İzmir European Jazz Festival]] is among the numerous events organized every year by the İKSEV (İzmir Foundation for Culture, Arts and Education) since 1994. The festival aims to bring together masters and lovers of [[jazz]] with the aim to generate feelings of love, friendship and peace.

The International İzmir Short Film Festival is organized since 1999 and is a member of the European Coordination of Film Festivals.

İzmir Metropolitan Municipality has built the [[Ahmet Adnan Saygun]] Art Center on a 21,000 m<sup>2</sup> land plot in the Güzelyalı district, in order to contribute to the city's culture and art life. The acoustics of the center have been prepared by [[Arup Group Limited|ARUP]] which is a noted company in this field.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-08-30|title=İzmir gezilecek yeler|url=https://gezicini.com/izmirde-gezilecek-en-guzel-yerler/|access-date=2020-10-28|website=Gezilecek Yerler Rehberi {{!}} Gezicini|language=tr}}</ref>

=== Music ===
In 2015 the [[Barış Youth Symphony Orchestra]] was founded, incorporating children with limited opportunities in low-income regions of the city, with the purpose to keep them away from crime on the street. The orchestra, grown up to nearly one hundred members, gives concerts accompanied by notable classic music artists.<ref name="ntv1"/>

=== Cuisine ===
İzmir's cuisine has largely been affected by its multicultural history, hence the large variety of food originating from the [[Aegean Region|Aegean]] and [[Mediterranean]] regions. Population movement from [[Eastern Anatolia Region|Eastern]] and [[South East Anatolia]] regions has enriched the local cuisine. Another factor is the large and fertile area of land surrounding the region which grows a rich selection of vegetables. There is considerable culinary usage of green leaf vegetables and wild plants amongst the residents, especially those with insular heritage, such as the immigrants from [[Crete]]. Some of the common dishes found here are the [[tarhana]] soup (made from dried [[yoghurt]] and tomatoes), "İzmir" [[köfte]], [[Yuvarlak|sulu köfte]], [[keşkek]] (boiled wheat with meat), zerde (sweetened rice with [[saffron]]) and ''mücver'' (made from zucchine and eggs). A [[Turkish Jews|Sephardic]] contribution to the [[Turkish cuisine]], [[boyoz]] and [[lokma]] are pastries associated with İzmir. [[Kumru (sandwich)|Kumru]] is a special kind of sandwich that is associated particularly with the [[Çeşme]] district and features cheese and tomato in its basics, with [[sucuk]] also added sometimes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eatinizmir.com/trademark-tastes-of-izmir-1|title=İzmir Food: Boyoz and Kumru|publisher=EatinIzmir|year=2007|access-date=2007-09-07|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021070323/http://www.eatinizmir.com/trademark-tastes-of-izmir-1|archive-date=2008-10-21}}</ref>

== Economy ==
[[File:Skyscrapers_in_Izmir_-_Turkey.jpg|thumb|300px|Skyscrapers in the [[Bayraklı]] district of İzmir]]
The [[İzmir Harbor|port of İzmir]] is Turkey's main port for exports in terms of the freight handled and its [[Free economic zone|free zone]] is the leader among the twenty in Turkey. The workforce, and particularly its rising class of young professionals, is concentrated either in the city or in its immediate vicinity (such as in [[Manisa]] and [[Turgutlu]]), and as either larger companies or [[Small and Medium-sized Enterprise|SME]]s, affirm their names with an increasingly wider global scale and intensity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2007/03/28/microsoft-acquires-devbiz-business-solutions|title=Microsoft acquires Devbiz business solutions|author=WebProNews|publisher=WebProNews|access-date=May 22, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102083807/http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2007/03/28/microsoft-acquires-devbiz-business-solutions|archive-date=January 2, 2011|df=mdy-all}} See also: [[List of companies acquired by Microsoft Corporation]]</ref>

Trade through the city's port had a determinant importance for the economy of the Ottoman Empire at the beginning of the 19th century and the economic foundations of the early decades of Turkey's Republican era were also laid here during the [[İzmir Economic Congress]].

At present, İzmir area's economy is divided in value between various types of activities, as follows: 30.5% for industry, 22.9% for trade and related services, 13.5% for transportation and communication and 7.8% for agriculture. In 2008, İzmir provided 10.5% of all tax revenues collected by Turkey and its exports corresponded to 6% and its imports to 4% of Turkey's foreign trade.

The province as a whole is Turkey's third largest exporter after Istanbul and Bursa, and the fifth largest importer. 85–90% of the region's exports and approximately one fifth of all Turkish exports are made through the [[İzmir Harbor|Port of Alsancak]] with an annual [[Intermodal container|container]] loading capacity of close to a million.<ref>{{cite web  | url = http://www.izto.org.tr/IZTO/TC/IZTO+Bilgi/izmir/ekonomi/eko2.htm  | title = İzmir's Foreign Trade Structure  | publisher = İzmir Chamber of Commerce  | year = 2009  | language = tr  | url-status = live  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100429090107/http://www.izto.org.tr/IZTO/TC/IZTO+Bilgi/izmir/ekonomi/eko2.htm  | archive-date = 2010-04-29  }}</ref>

The 51,295 capacity (all-seater) [[İzmir Atatürk Stadium]] regularly hosts, apart from [[Süper Lig|Turkish Super League]] games of İzmir-based teams, many other Super League and [[Turkish Cup]] derby matches.

[[File:İzmir_Alsancak_Stadium.jpg|thumb|Renovated [[İzmir Alsancak Stadium]] has a seating capacity of 15,358.]]

The three big [[football (soccer)|football]] clubs in İzmir are [[Altay S.K.|Altay]] (42 seasons in Süper Lig), [[Göztepe S.K.|Göztepe]] (30 seasons in Süper Lig), and [[Karşıyaka S.K.|Karşıyaka]] (16 seasons in Süper Lig). Other notable football clubs include: [[Bucaspor 1928]], [[Altınordu F.K.|Altınordu]], [[Menemen F.K.]], and [[İzmirspor]]. [[Bucaspor]], now dissolved, were relegated from the top tier, [[Süper Lig|Turkish Super League]], at the end of the [[2010–11 Süper Lig|2010–11 season]].

[[Göztepe S.K.|Göztepe]] made sports history in Turkey by having played the [[1968–69 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup#Semi-finals|semi-finals]] of the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] (which later became the [[UEFA Cup]]) in the [[1968–69 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|1968–69 season]], and the [[1969–70 European Cup Winners' Cup#Quarter-finals|quarter-finals]] of the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in the [[1969–70 European Cup Winners' Cup|1969–70 season]]; becoming the first ever Turkish football club to play a semi-final game in Europe and the only one for two decades, until [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] reached the [[1988–89 European Cup#Semi-finals|semi-finals]] of the [[1988–89 European Cup]].

Göztepe and [[Altay S.K.|Altay]] have won the [[Turkish Cup]] twice for İzmir and all of İzmir's teams have periodically jumped in and out of [[Süper Lig]]. Historically, İzmir is also the birthplace of two Greek sports clubs, namely the multi-sport club [[Panionios]] and association football club [[Apollon Smyrni F.C.]] which were founded in the city and moved to [[Athens]] after 1922.

[[Karşıyaka S.K.|Karşıyaka]]'s basketball department [[Karşıyaka Basket]] won the [[Basketbol Süper Ligi|Turkish Basketball League]] twice (in the 1986–87 and 2014–15 seasons), the [[Turkish Basketball Cup|Turkish Cup]] once (in the 2013–14 season) and the [[Turkish Basketball Presidential Cup|Presidential Cup]] twice (in 1987 and 2014). The team plays its games at the [[Karşıyaka Arena]]. The 10,000 capacity (all-seater) [[İzmir Halkapınar Sport Hall|Halkapınar Sports Hall]] is currently İzmir's largest [[arena|indoor sports arena]] and was among the venues of the [[2010 FIBA World Championship]] in Turkey.

[[Arkas Spor]] is a successful volleyball club in the city, having won the [[Turkish Men's Volleyball League]] and the [[Turkish Men's Volleyball Cup|Turkish Cup]] several times, and the [[CEV Challenge Cup]] in the 2008–09 season. [[İzmir Atatürk Volleyball Hall]] regularly hosts the games of the city's volleyball teams.

The city boasts of several sports legends, past and present. Already at the dawn of its history, notable natives such as the son of its first port's founder [[Pelops]] had attained fame and kingdom with a [[chariot race]] and [[Onomastus of Smyrna|Onomastus]] is one of history's first recorded sportspeople, having won the [[boxing]] contest in the [[Olympiad]] of 688 BC.

Born in İzmir, and nicknamed ''Taçsız Kral'' (The Uncrowned King), 1960s football star [[Metin Oktay]] is a legend in Turkey. Oktay became the first notable Turkish footballer to play abroad, with [[U.S. Città di Palermo|Palermo]] in [[Italy]]'s [[Serie A]], during the [[1961–62 Serie A|1961–1962 season]]. Two other notable football figures from İzmir are [[Alpay Özalan]] and [[Mustafa Denizli]], the first having played for [[Aston Villa F.C.]] between 2000 and 2003 and the second, after a long playing career as the captain of İzmir's [[Altay S.K.]], still pursues a successful career as a [[Coach (sport)|coach]], being the only manager in [[Süper Lig|Turkish Super League]] history to win a championship title with each of Istanbul's "Big Three" clubs ([[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]], [[Fenerbahçe S.K.]], and [[Beşiktaş J.K.]]) and having guided the [[Turkey national football team|Turkish national football team]] to the [[UEFA Euro 2000]] Quarter-Finals.

Politically, İzmir is considered a stronghold of [[Kemalism]] and the [[Republican People's Party]] (CHP). The current mayor of the İzmir Metropolitan Municipality is Cemil Tugay from the [[Republican People's Party]] (CHP), in office since 2024. His predecessor [[Tunç Soyer]](CHP) was first elected in 2019 but was not nominated by the CHP for a second term.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Özgenç |first=Özgecan |date=2024-01-29 |title=CHP İzmir'de Cemil Tugay'ı aday gösterdi {{!}} Özgür Özel: "'Değişim nerede' diyenler İzmir'e baksın" |url=https://medyascope.tv/2024/01/29/chp-izmirde-cemil-tugayi-aday-gosterdi-ozgur-ozel-degisim-nerede-diyenler-izmire-baksin/ |access-date=2024-04-03 |website=Medyascope |language=tr}}</ref>

İzmir has traditionally been a stronghold for the CHP, the centre-left [[Kemalism|Kemalist]] political party which forms the main opposition in the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]]. Being the third largest city in Turkey, İzmir is viewed as the CHP's most prized electoral stronghold, since the party has a more limited support base in both [[Istanbul]] and [[Ankara]]. Since the right-wing [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) gained power in 2002, the electorate of İzmir has been notable for voting strongly in favour of the CHP in every general and local election. In the [[2007 Turkish constitutional referendum|2007]] and [[2010 Turkish constitutional referendum|2010]] and [[2017 Turkish constitutional referendum|2017]] referendums, the İzmir electorate strongly rejected the AKP government's constitutional reform proposals. Almost all of the city's districts have returned strong pluralities or majorities for the CHP in past elections, although the party lost ground in the [[2014 Turkish local elections|2014 local elections]].

Due to the economic and historical importance of the city, İzmir has long been a strategic electoral target for the AKP, since beating the CHP in their most significant stronghold would be politically substantial. The majority of the citizens in İzmir have continued to vote for the centre-left political parties (in particular the CHP), despite large-scale pledges by the AKP promising investment and new infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akparti.org.tr/site/haberler/iste-35-izmir-35-proje/8254#1|title=AKPARTİ|website=www.akparti.org.tr|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109152254/http://www.akparti.org.tr/site/haberler/iste-35-izmir-35-proje/8254#1|archive-date=2014-11-09}}</ref> For general elections, İzmir returns 28 members of parliament to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. The province is split into [[İzmir (electoral districts)|two electoral districts]] which roughly divide the city into a [[İzmir (2nd electoral district)|northern]] and [[İzmir (1st electoral district)|southern district]], each electing 14 MPs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milletvekili.tv/izmir-ikinci-bolge-milletvekili-adaylari|title=İzmir 2.Bölge Milletvekili Adayları Seçim 2018|website=Milletvekili Adayları Seçim 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028231751/http://www.milletvekili.tv/izmir-ikinci-bolge-milletvekili-adaylari|archive-date=2014-10-28}}</ref> [[2013–14 protests in Turkey|Anti-government protests in 2013 and 2014]] against the AKP were particularly strong in İzmir.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22802572|title=No end in sight for protests in Turkey's Izmir|last=Sommerville|first=Quentin|work=BBC News |date=7 June 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212053806/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22802572|archive-date=12 December 2014}}</ref>

During the [[2023 Turkish presidential election|2023 presidential election]], 63.31% of the city's electorate voted for the CHP candidate Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu. In contrast, the AKP candidate [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] received 31.48% of the vote.<ref>{{Cite web |title=İZMİR Seçim Sonuçları, 14 Mayıs 2023 Cumhurbaşkanı Seçimi |url=https://secim.sozcu.com.tr/secim2023mayis14/secim2023mayis14/izmir-secim-sonuclari |access-date=2024-04-03 |website=secim.sozcu.com.tr |language=tr}}</ref>

Bus companies' shuttle services pick up customers from each of their branch offices scattered across the city at regular intervals, often free of charge. To facilitate easier access, a [[M5 (İzmir Metro)|Halkapınar—Otogar metro line]] has long been deliberated but construction has never begun – though throughout his campaign and upon his election as mayor of İzmir in 2019, [[Tunç Soyer]] has outlined it as one of his priorities.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Türkmen |first1=Hamdi |title=Tunç Soyer, ilk 100 güne çok hızlı başladı... |url=http://www.kanalben.com/tunc-soyer-ilk-100-gune-cok-hizli-basladi-makale,5824.html |website=kanalben.com |access-date=4 May 2019 |date=21 April 2019}}</ref>

However, the bus operations, the O of the acronym ESHOT, has retained the original name. ESHOT operates 322 lines with about 1,500 buses and a staff of 2,700. It has five garages at Çakalburnu, Çiğli, Adatepe, Aktepe, and Mersinli. A privately owned company, İzulaş, operates 400 buses from two garages, running services under contract for ESHOT.
