'''Astrakhan''' ({{langx|ru|Астрахань}}, {{IPA|ru|ˈastrəxənʲ|IPA|audio=Ru-Астрахань.oga}}) is the largest city and [[administrative centre]] of [[Astrakhan Oblast]] in southern [[Russia]]. The city lies on two banks of the [[Volga]], in the upper part of the [[Volga Delta]], on eleven islands of the [[Caspian Depression]], 60 miles (100 km) from the [[Caspian Sea]], with a population of 475,629 residents at the 2021 Census.<ref name=2021Census/> At an elevation of {{convert|28|m|sp=us}} below [[sea level]], it is the lowest city in Russia. 

Astrakhan was formerly the capital of the [[Astrakhan Khanate|Khanate of Astrakhan]] (a remnant of the [[Golden Horde]]) of the [[Astrakhan Tatars]], and was located on the higher right bank of the Volga, {{convert|7|mi|spell=in}} from the present-day city. Situated on caravan and water routes, it developed from a village into a large trading centre, before being conquered by [[Timur]] in 1395 and captured by [[Ivan the Terrible]] in 1556 and in 1558 it was moved to its present site.

==Etymology==
The name is a corruption of Hashtarkhan, itself a corruption of [[Xacitarxan|Haji Tarkhan]] ({{Lang|fa|{{nq|حاجی‌ ترخان}}}})—a name amply evidenced in the medieval writings. [[Tarkhan]] is possibly a Turco-Mongolian title standing for "great [[khan (title)|khan]]", or "king", while haji or [[hajji]] is a title given to one who has made the Islamic requisite of [[Hajj|pilgrimage to Mecca]]. Together, they denoted "the king who has visited Mecca".{{fact|date=March 2024}} The city has given its name to the particular pelts from young [[karakul sheep]], and in particular to the [[karakul hat|hats]] traditionally made from the pelts.{{fact|date=March 2024}}

Colloquially, the city is known by the short form ''Astra''. Another popular nickname is ''The Caspian Capital''.{{fact|date=March 2024}}

==History==
===Medieval history===
{{Main|Xacitarxan}}

Astrakhan is in the [[Volga Delta]], which is rich in [[sturgeon]] and exotic plants. The fertile area formerly contained the capitals of [[Khazars|Khazaria]] and the [[Golden Horde]]. Astrakhan was first mentioned by travelers in the early 13th century as [[Xacitarxan]]. [[Timur|Tamerlane]] burnt it to the ground in 1395 during his [[Tokhtamysh–Timur war|war with the Golden Horde]]. From 1459 to 1556, Xacitarxan was the capital of [[Astrakhan Khanate]] by the [[Astrakhan Tatars]]. The ruins of this medieval settlement were found by archaeologists 12&nbsp;km upstream from the modern-day city.

Starting in A.D. 1324, [[Ibn Battuta]], the famous [[Berbers|Berber]] [[Muslims|Muslim]] traveler, began his pilgrimage from his native city of [[Tangier]], present-day [[Morocco]] to Mecca. Along the {{convert|7500|mi|km|order=flip|adj=on|sp=us}} trek, which took nearly 29 years, Battuta came in contact with many new cultures, which he writes about in his diaries. One specific country that he passed through on his journey was the [[Golden Horde]] ruled by the descendants of [[Genghis Khan]], located on the Volga River in southern Russia; which Battuta refers to as the river Athal. He then claims the Athal is, "one of the greatest rivers in the world". In the winter, the Khan stays in Astrakhan. Due to the cold water, [[Özbeg Khan]] ordered the people of Astrakhan to lay many bundles of hay down on the frozen river. He does this to allow the people to travel over the ice. When Battuta and the Khan spoke about Battuta visiting Constantinople, which the Khan granted him permission to do, the Khan then gifted Battuta with fifteen hundred dinars, many horses, and a dress of honor.<ref>"[https://orias.berkeley.edu/resources-teachers/travels-ibn-battuta/journey/lands-golden-horde-chagatai-1332-1333 Lands of the Golden Horde & the Chagatai: 1332 - 1333] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180812151243/https://orias.berkeley.edu/resources-teachers/travels-ibn-battuta/journey/lands-golden-horde-chagatai-1332-1333 |date=August 12, 2018 }}".

In 1556, the khanate was conquered by [[Ivan the Terrible]], who had a new fortress, or [[Astrakhan Kremlin|kremlin]], built on a steep hill overlooking the Volga in 1558. This year is traditionally considered to be the foundation of the modern city.<ref name="gr">{{Cite book |title=Энциклопедия Города России |publisher=Большая Российская Энциклопедия |year=2003 |isbn=5-7107-7399-9 |location=Moscow |page=28}}</ref>

In 1569, during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1568–1570)|Russo-Turkish War]], Astrakhan was besieged by the Ottomans, who had to retreat in disarray. A year later, the Ottoman sultan renounced his claims to Astrakhan, thus opening the entire Volga River to Russian traffic.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The [[Ottoman Empire]], though militarily defeated, insisted on safe passage for Muslim pilgrims and traders from [[Central Asia]] as well as the destruction of the Russian fort on the [[Terek (river)|Terek River]].<ref>Janet Martin, ''Medieval Russia:980-1584'', 356.</ref> In the 17th century, the city was developed as a Russian gate to the Orient.

For seventeen months in 1670–1671, Astrakhan was held by [[Stenka Razin]] and his [[Cossacks]]. Early in the following century, [[Peter the Great]] constructed a [[shipyard]] here and made Astrakhan the base for his hostilities against Persia, and later in the same century [[Catherine the Great]] accorded the city important industrial privileges.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911 |inline=y |wstitle=Astrakhan (town) |display=Astrakhan |volume=2 |page=795 |first=Peter Alexeivitch |last=Kropotkin |author-link=Peter Kropotkin}}</ref>

The city was held from 1707 by the Cossacks under [[Kondraty Bulavin]] during the [[Bulavin Rebellion]] until they were defeated the next year. A [[Kalmykia|Kalmuck]] khan laid an abortive siege to the kremlin several years before that.

In 1717, it became the seat of [[Astrakhan Governorate]], whose first governors included [[Artemy Petrovich Volynsky]] and [[Vasily Tatishchev|Vasily Nikitich Tatishchev]]. Six years later, Astrakhan served as a base for [[Alexander Bekovich-Cherkassky|the first Russian venture into Central Asia]]. In 1702, 1718 and 1767, it suffered severely from fires; in 1719 it was plundered by the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] Persians; and in 1830, [[cholera]] killed much of the populace.<ref name="EB1911" />

The [[Astrakhan Kremlin]] was built from the 1580s to the 1620s from bricks taken from the site of [[Sarai Berke]]. Its two impressive cathedrals were consecrated in 1700 and 1710, respectively. Built by masters from [[Yaroslavl]], they retain many traditional features of Russian church architecture, while their exterior decoration is definitely [[baroque]].

In March 1919 after a failed workers' revolt against [[Bolshevik]] rule, 3,000 to 5,000 people were executed in less than a week by the [[Cheka]] under orders from [[Sergey Kirov]]. Some victims had stones tied around their necks and were thrown into the Volga.<ref>[books.google.com.sg/books?id=00o2eO8w06oC&pg=PA5]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Archived copy |url=http://www.korolevperevody.co.uk/korolev/astrakhan.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222013903/http://www.korolevperevody.co.uk/korolev/astrakhan.htm |archive-date=December 22, 2011 |access-date=March 12, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

During [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, the [[A-A line]] running from Astrakhan to [[Arkhangelsk]] was to be the eastern limit of German military operation and occupation. The plan was never carried out, as Germany captured neither the two cities nor [[Moscow]]. In the autumn of 1942, the region to the west of Astrakhan became one of the easternmost points in the [[Soviet Union]] reached by the invading German [[Wehrmacht]], during [[Case Blue]], the offensive which led to the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. Light armored forces of German Army Group A made brief scouting missions as close as 35&nbsp;km to Astrakhan before withdrawing. In the same period, elements of both the [[Luftwaffe]]'s [[Kampfgeschwader 4#Eastern Front|KG 4]] and [[Kampfgeschwader 100#Stalingrad, Caspian Sea, central and southern sectors|KG 100]] bomber wings attacked Astrakhan, flying several air raids and bombing the city's oil terminals and harbor installations.

In 1943, Astrakhan was made the seat of a Soviet oblast within the [[RSFSR]]. The oblast was retained as a national province of the independent [[Russian Federation]] in the 1991 administrative reshuffle after the dismemberment of the [[Soviet Union]].

In the present day, Astrakhan is a large industrial centre of the Volga country, Russia, with a population of over 500,000. Starting nearly 400 years ago and continuing to the present day, Astrakhan has been Russia's main center of fish processing. The market for fish is a large component of the economy in this city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://russia.rin.ru/guides_e/2742.html|title=Astrakhan|website=russia.rin.ru|accessdate=May 14, 2023}}</ref>

Owing to shared Caspian borders, Astrakhan recently has been playing a significant role in the relations between Russia and Azerbaijan. As the latter's government has been heavily investing into the wellbeing of the city, Astrakhan has recently begun to symbolize the friendship between both countries. In 2010 a bridge was constructed with donations from Azerbaijan, which was named "Bridge of Friendship".<ref name="heydar-aliyev-foundation">{{Cite web |title=Heydar Aliyev Foundation - Azerbaijan-Russia Friendship Bridge in Astrakhan |url=http://www.heydar-aliyev-foundation.org/en/content/view/93/837/Azerbaijan-Russia-Friendship-Bridge-in-Astrakhan |access-date=September 6, 2017 |website=heydar-aliyev-foundation.org}}</ref> Moreover, Azerbaijani government sponsored secondary school number 11, which carries the name of the national leader [[Heydar Aliyev]], as well as a children's entertainment center named "Dream".<ref name="azernews">{{Cite web |title=Azerbaijan, Russian Astrakhan mull relations |url=http://www.azernews.az/azerbaijan/66945.html |access-date=September 6, 2017 |website=azernews.az |date=May 12, 2014}}</ref> Apart from that, a park has been built in the center of Astrakhan which is dedicated to friendship between the two countries.

==Geography==
The city lies on two banks of the Volga, in the upper part of the Volga Delta, on eleven islands of the Caspian Depression, 60 miles (100 km) from the Caspian Sea. At an elevation of 28 meters (92 ft) below sea level, it is the lowest city in Russia.
===Climate===
Astrakhan features a [[continental climate|continental]] [[cold semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''BSk'') with cold winters and hot summers. Astrakhan is one of the driest cities in Europe. Rainfall is scarce but relatively evenly distributed throughout the course of the year with, however, more precipitation (58%) in the hot season (six hottest months of the year). 

The below sea-level elevation and long distance from the ocean of Astrakhan significantly influences the climate.
Winters are cold with average January temperature -3.6 °С (25.5 °F). Summer temperatures in Astrakhan are one of the highest in Russia with average Jule temperature 26.1 °С (79 °F) and may reach 40 °С (104 °F) and higher. The summers are much hotter than found further west on similar latitude in Europe and worldwide for [[46th parallel north|46°N]] with the notable exception of the interior Pacific Northwest of the United States.{{cn|date=August 2024}}  The mean annual temperature amplitude (difference between the mean monthly temperatures of the hottest and coldest months) is thus equal to 29.7 °С (85.5 °F) so the climate is truly continental. Spring and fall are basically transitional seasons between summer and winter.

There are direct flights between Astrakhan and [[Aktau]], [[Istanbul]], [[St. Petersburg]] and Moscow.

There is also a military airbase nearby ([[Astrakhan (air base)]]). 

Astrakhan is linked by rail to the north ([[Volgograd]] and Moscow), the east ([[Atyrau]] and [[Kazakhstan]]) and the south ([[Makhachkala]] and Baku). There are direct trains to Moscow, Volgograd, [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Baku]], [[Kyiv]], [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]] and other towns. Intercity and international buses are available as well. Public local transport is mainly provided by buses and minibuses called ''marshrutkas''. Until 2007 there were also trams, and until 2017 trolleybuses.
