'''Kuala Terengganu''' ({{IPA|zsm|ˈkuˈala ˈtəˈrəŋˈganu|lang}}; [[Terengganu Malay language|Terengganu Malay]]: ''Kole Tranung''), colloquially referred to as '''KT''', is the administrative, economic and royal [[List of capitals in Malaysia|capital]] of the state of [[Terengganu]], Malaysia. Kuala Terengganu is also the capital of [[Kuala Terengganu District]]. It is also the only [[List of capitals in Malaysia|royal capital]] among the nine royal states of the country to bear its state's name. Kuala Terengganu is located about 440 kilometres northeast of [[Kuala Lumpur]] on the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The city is situated at the estuary of [[Terengganu River]], facing the [[South China Sea]].

As a district, Kuala Terengganu is the smallest in terms of area, but it and [[Kuala Nerus District]] that together form the city area has the largest population in Terengganu. The city population was 406,317 in 2010<ref name=poparea>The total population and total area also includes the population and area for the district of Kuala Nerus, which was a part of the district of Kuala Terengganu, but Kuala Nerus is still under the jurisdiction of Kuala Terengganu City Council.</ref><ref name="pop">{{cite web|url=http://mbkt.terengganu.gov.my/jadual-mukim|title=Total Population by Ethnic Group, Sub-district and State, Malaysia, 2010|publisher=Kuala Terengganu City Council|access-date=22 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408130553/http://mbkt.terengganu.gov.my/jadual-mukim|archive-date=8 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and grew to 375,424 in 2020.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.dosm.gov.my/v1/uploads/files/7_Publication/Infographic/PocketStats/Negeri/Terengganu/ST3-2020/Poket_Stats_Terengganu_ST3_2020.pdf|title=Poket Stats Negeri Terengganu ST3 2020|publisher=Department of Statistics Malaysia|access-date=7 January 2021|archive-date=7 January 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220107100410/https://www.dosm.gov.my/v1/uploads/files/7_Publication/Infographic/PocketStats/Negeri/Terengganu/ST3-2020/Poket_Stats_Terengganu_ST3_2020.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[List of cities in Malaysia|City status]] was awarded to Kuala Terengganu with the title ''Bandaraya Warisan Pesisir Air'' (English: Waterfront Heritage City) on 1 January 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mbkt.terengganu.gov.my/en/mbkt/profile/background|publisher=Kuala Terengganu City Council|title=Background|access-date=27 December 2017}}</ref>

Besides being a major political and economic centre to the state, the city is also the main gateway to many of the state's tourist destinations. The attractions in and around the city include [[Chinatown, Kuala Terengganu|Kampung Cina]], Pasar Besar Kedai Payang, Terengganu State Museum, and Batu Buruk Beach. Even though the city is not spared from modernity and development, Kuala Terengganu still retains strong [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] influences that are intermixed with other cultures from its long history as a port.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expatgomalaysia.com/2013/04/09/the-east-coast-of-malaysia-an-enchanting-encounter/|title=The East Coast of Malaysia, an Enchanting Encounter|author=David Bowden|publisher=Expat Go Malaysia|date=9 April 2013|access-date=25 March 2015}}</ref>

==Etymology==
In [[Malay language|Malay]], ''kuala'' can have the meanings of "river mouth", "estuary", or "confluence". Thus, the name ''Kuala Terengganu'' is roughly translated as "the [[confluence]]/[[estuary]] of Terengganu", referring to the broad expanse of the [[Terengganu River]] estuary which empties into the [[South China Sea]]. There are several theories regarding the name ''Terengganu''. One such theory attributes the name's origin to ''terang ganu'', [[Malay Language|Malay]] for 'bright [[rainbow]]'.<ref name="state name">{{cite web|url=http://www.jutr.gov.my/pesuma05/ASASTRG.htm|title=Data Asas dan Sejarah Ringkas Negeri Terengganu Darul Iman|language=ms|publisher=Department of Survey and Mapping Malaysia (JUPEM)|access-date=21 March 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070608121937/http://www.jutr.gov.my/pesuma05/ASASTRG.htm|archive-date=8 June 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Another story, which is considered to be the most popular version, is said to have been originally narrated by the ninth [[Sultan of Terengganu]], [[Baginda Omar]]. It tells of a party of hunters from [[Pahang]] roving and hunting in the area of what is now southern Terengganu. One of the hunters spotted a big [[canine tooth|animal fang]] lying on the ground. A fellow party member asked to which animal did the fang belong. The hunter, not knowing which animal, simply answered ''taring anu'' (Malay: 'fang of something'). The party later returned to Pahang with a rich hoard of game, fur and sandalwood, which impressed their neighbours. They asked the hunters where did they source their riches, to which they replied, from the land of ''taring anu'', which later evolved into Terengganu.<ref name="state name"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.istana.terengganu.gov.my/asal_usul.php|title=Sejarah Ringkas Negeri Terengganu (Asal Usul Nama Terengganu)|language=ms|publisher=[[Sultan of Terengganu]]|access-date=7 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407120228/http://www.istana.terengganu.gov.my/asal_usul.php|archive-date=7 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==
Among the earliest references of Terengganu are in Chinese historical sources. A Chinese writer's note during the [[Sui dynasty]] has mentioned about a state named ''Tan-Tan'' that sent tributes to China.<ref name="china">{{cite web|url=http://eprints.usm.my/11144/1/Hubungan_Ufti_Tan-Tan_Dan_Pan-Pan.pdf|title=Hubungan Ufti Tan-Tan dan P'an-P'an dengan China pada Zaman Dinasti Sui dan Tang: Satu Analisis Ekonomi|author1=Nazarudin Zainun|author2=Nasha Rodziadi Khaw|author3=Tarmiji Masron|author4=Zulkifli Jaafar|publisher=[[Beijing Foreign Studies University]], [[University of Malaya]]|language=ms|date=2009|access-date=7 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Wheatley|title=The Golden Khersonese: Studies in the Historical Geography of the Malay Peninsula Before A.D. 1500|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2T0NngEACAAJ|year=1980|publisher=University Malaya}}</ref> The state was presumably located somewhere in Terengganu.<ref>{{cite book|author=George Cœdès|title=The Indianized States of South-East Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iDyJBFTdiwoC&pg=PA52|year=1968|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-0368-1|pages=52–}}</ref> Tan-Tan sent [[tribute]]s to Sui dynasty and then to the [[Tang dynasty]] after Sui dynasty has collapsed.<ref name="china"/> It ceased to send tributes to China after it came under the dominance of the [[Srivijaya]] during the 7th century.

However, in 1839, Tengku Omar returned to Terengganu with his entourage to reclaim the throne. He defeated Sultan Muhammad and forced Sultan Muhammad to flee.

Kuala Terengganu continued to be Terengganu's capital when it was still a [[vassal state]] of [[Siam]] and during the early years of British colonisation of [[British Malaya|Malaya]].

=== British Colonial Period ===
Terengganu fell under the administration of Britain through the [[Bangkok Treaty of 1909]] and was forced to accept a resident "British advisor". Terengganu, along with four other states were grouped under the term of [[Unfederated Malay States]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Barbara Watson Andaya|author2=Leonard Y.

=== World War II ===
On 18 December 1941, Japanese forces from Kota Bahru would advance towards Kuala Terengganu. On 18 October 1943, Terengganu was [[Si Rat Malai|annexed]] by [[Thailand]] as part of an agreement with the Japanese. After the war, the British regained control of Terengganu.

The city is administered by [[Kuala Terengganu City Council]], which covers the whole area of [[Kuala Terengganu District|Kuala Terengganu district]] as well as [[Kuala Nerus District|Kuala Nerus district]]. The district's location at the estuary of Terengganu River divided the district into two parts, ''Kuala Terengganu Utara'' (North Kuala Terengganu), now known as Kuala Nerus, and ''Kuala Terengganu Selatan'' (South Kuala Terengganu), which is considered to be Kuala Terengganu proper. As the capital, the city is vital to the political and economic welfare of the state. It is the centre for the state and federal government agencies administration buildings, housing the offices of many ministries' departments and governmental bodies, such as the Immigration and Customs Department, State Economic Planning Unit, [[Pos Malaysia]] Kuala Terengganu General Post Office, Terengganu State Library, and many others. As the administrative capital of Terengganu, the Legislative Assembly convenes at Wisma Darul Iman, the state secretariat building. Kuala Terengganu is also the royal capital of the state, being the site of the Sultan's many palaces, for example Istana Badariah and Istana Maziah.

The [[Election Commission of Malaysia]] has divided Kuala Terengganu into eleven state assembly districts which covers the constituencies of [[Hulu Terengganu (federal constituency)|Hulu Terengganu]], [[Marang (federal constituency)|Marang]], [[Setiu (federal constituency)|Setiu]], [[Kuala Nerus (federal constituency)|Kuala Nerus]] and [[Kuala Terengganu (federal constituency)|Kuala Terengganu]], which are:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dun.terengganu.gov.my/|title=Peta Kawasan (Kawasan Parlimen Negeri Terengganu)|language=ms|publisher=State Legislative Assembly of Terengganu|access-date=15 March 2015}}</ref>

Kuala Terengganu was first designated as a local government area in 1928 through ''the Municipal and Health Enactment 1928''. At this time, the area only covered a small part of the current city border, specifically the historic core around the river mouth. The area, nevertheless, was enlarged slowly. In 1950, the town was administered  by Kuala Terengganu Town Board under section 51(1), ''the Local Authority Election Ordinance 1950''. Like many other town boards at that time, the process of town planning was carried out according to ''the Town Board Enactment 1930''.<ref name="morfologi">{{cite report|title=Morfologi Bandar Kuala Terengganu|publisher=Department of Town and Village Planning of Peninsular Malaysia, Ministry of Housing and Local Government|date=December 2009}}</ref> Until 1979, the town continued to be managed by Kuala Terengganu Town Board that governed an area of 5.4 square miles (1,398.6 hectares), with a population of around 53,300 people. Kuala Terengganu Municipal Council (MPKT) was established due to the development that spilled over to the areas outside the jurisdiction of the former Town Board. MPKT was established on 18 January 1979 under the enforcement of ''the Local Government Act 1976''. MPKT was created through the amalgamation of Kuala Terengganu Town Board and four local councils (North KT, South KT, West KT, and Central KT) with an area of 18,712 hectares covering 21 ''mukim'' or sub-districts, including some parts of Northern Kuala Terengganu.<ref name="morfologi"/>

On 1 January 1985, the sub-districts of Bukit Palos and Alor Limbat were removed from the council and placed under the administration of Marang District Council. With these changes, the area under the council's administration was reduced to 16,806 hectares. On 16 December 1996, Kuala Terengganu Municipal Council was extended to cover the entire area of Kuala Terengganu district back then, including the resort island, [[Redang Island]]. With that, the number of the sub-districts increased to 23 while the area increased dramatically to 60,528 hectares.<ref name="morfologi"/><ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web |url=http://www.miricouncil.gov.my/modules/web/pages.php?mod=webpage&sub=page&id=60&menu_id=0&sub_id=94|title= Background|date=4 September 2014 |website=Official Website of Miri City Council|access-date=1 April 2015}}</ref> On 1 January 2008, a declaration was made by the state government and Kuala Terengganu became the first city on the East Coast region of [[Peninsular Malaysia]] to achieve city status.

As the local council for the districts of Kuala Terengganu and [[Kuala Nerus]], and an agency under the Terengganu state government, MBKT is responsible for public health and sanitation, waste removal and management, town planning and beautification, environmental protection and building control, social, economic and tourism development, and general maintenance and constructions of urban infrastructure. The MBKT main headquarters is located at Menara Permint in Jalan Sultan Ismail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mbkt.terengganu.gov.my/functions|title=Functions|publisher=Kuala Terengganu City Council|access-date=23 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408120011/http://mbkt.terengganu.gov.my/functions|archive-date=8 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> There are two districts that are administered by MBKT. They are Kuala Terengganu and [[Kuala Nerus]]. Kuala Nerus was formerly a part of Kuala Terengganu district, but on 18 September 2014, the sixth [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Malaysian Prime Minister]], Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak declared this northern part of Kuala Terengganu district as the eighth and newest district in Terengganu state.<ref name="Kuala Nerus"/>

With a population or over 300,000 and a size of 39,890 hectares, it comprises a substantial part of the former larger Kuala Terengganu district. Significant development in the areas of higher education and housing projects have occurred there in contemporary times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.therakyatpost.com/news/2014/09/18/kuala-nerus-declared-eighth-district-terengganu/|title=Kuala Nerus declared eighth district in Terengganu|work=Bernama|publisher=The Rakyat Post|date=18 September 2014|access-date=15 March 2015|archive-date=21 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321181536/http://www.therakyatpost.com/news/2014/09/18/kuala-nerus-declared-eighth-district-terengganu/|url-status=dead}}</ref> The main population centres of Kuala Nerus include Gong Badak and Batu Rakit. Among major education institutions located in this district are [[Universiti Malaysia Terengganu]], [[Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin]], The Institute of Teacher Education Dato Razali Ismail Campus and an industrial training institute. The Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA) Teaching Hospital is now under construction, thus providing this district with a new establishment. The Sultan Mahmud Airport is located within the district, as is the multipurpose Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin Stadium. Although Kuala Nerus and Kuala Terengganu are now two districts on their own, since both of them are under the administration of the same local government, this makes MBKT among the few [[Local government in Malaysia|local governments in Malaysia]] to manage two different districts e.g. [[Alor Setar]], [[Penang Island]] and [[Seberang Perai]].

==Geography==
{{wide image|Kuala Terengganu viewed from Bukit Panorama.jpg|700px|The city view from the top of Bukit Panorama, a hillside recreational area.}}
The eastern part of Terengganu district that faces the [[South China Sea]] is characterised by sandy coastal beaches that cover the entire stretch of both parts. Small bays and coastal plains can be found. The district is divided into four major drainage basins: Terengganu [[List of rivers of Malaysia|River]] basin, Nerus River basin, Ibai River basin, and other small rivers basin. Certain parts of the rivers of Kuala Terengganu are lined with swamp forests.<ref name="morfologi"/> Hills between 200 and 600 metres mostly dominate the western part of the district, with more than 70% of the district made up of lowlands less than 20 metres high because of its geographical proximity to the coast. The city itself has a few high points with the highest being Bukit Besar, followed by Bukit Kecil. [[Bukit Puteri]] is centrally located in the city, just near the Terengganu River estuary. The lowlands provide the district with suitable areas for plantations such as paddy, palm oil trees, and rubber trees.<ref name="morfologi"/>

===Climate===
[[File:Sea view of Kuala Terengganu.jpg|thumb|right|Sea view of Kuala Terengganu with [[tropical rainforest climate]].]]
As a part of Terengganu, Kuala Terengganu has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] under the [[Köppen climate classification]] (Af) with constant temperature and high humidity. The amount of rainfall varies according to the monsoon season. It is generally fairly hot and humid all year round, averaging from 28&nbsp;°C to 30&nbsp;°C in daytime and slightly cooler after dusk. Nevertheless, the sea breeze from South China Sea somehow moderates the humidity in offshore areas while the altitude and lush forest trees and plant has cooled the mountain and rural areas.<ref name="tc">{{cite web|url=http://www.terengganu.climatemps.com/|title=Kuala Terengganu Climate|publisher=Terengganu Climate|access-date=7 August 2015}}</ref>

There are two main types of monsoons in the state. The southwest monsoon season is usually established in the later half of May or early June and ends in September. The prevailing wind flow is generally southwesterly and light, below 15 knots. The northeast monsoon season usually starts in early November and ends in March. During this season, steady easterly or northeasterly winds of 10 to 20 knots prevail. The winds over the east coast states of Peninsular Malaysia may reach 30 knots or more during periods of strong surges of cold air from the north (cold surges). The annual rainfall of this area is 2,911 millimetres.<ref name="tc"/> During the northeast monsoon season, Kuala Terengganu, being exposed to the coast, receives heavy rainfall. It is not advised to visit any of the offshore islands or participating in sea activities as the sea can be very rough. However, in some clear sunny days during the monsoon season, surprisingly east coast is always presented with clear blue sky and cooling wind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terengganutourism.com/weather.htm|title=Terengganu weather forecast, climate, monsoon, raining season|publisher=Terengganu Tourism|access-date=15 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409051513/http://www.terengganutourism.com/weather.htm|archive-date=9 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.met.gov.my/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=75&Itemid=1089|title=General Climate of Malaysia|publisher=[[Malaysian Meteorological Department]]|access-date=15 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409051232/http://www.met.gov.my/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=75&Itemid=1089|archive-date=9 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

The economic sector in Kuala Terengganu is mostly made up of small-scale manufacturing industries such as the traditional textile making, local food industries, arts and craft factories, and agriculture, with most of them centred around residential areas or villages. There are two main industrial estates catered to bigger industries, one in Chendering and the other one in Gong Badak. Factories such as those that produce bricks or timber products are located further away from the main city areas. As the principal gateway for tourists to the state, tourism remains as one of economic source for Kuala Terengganu.<ref name="morfologi"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/Timur/20130106/wt_02/Pelancongan-jadi-tulang-belakang-Terengganu|title=Pelancongan jadi tulang belakang Terengganu|language=ms|work=Utusan Malaysia|date=6 January 2013|access-date=30 March 2015}}</ref>

Transport facilities that are available in Kuala Terengganu include the taxicab and Kuala Terengganu Bus Terminal where the local bus services and interstate coaches to all major cities and towns in Peninsular Malaysia and [[Singapore]] operate. There is a limited service tourist bus that plies back and forth to tourist areas such as the Nor Arfa batik outlet south of the city, and the jetty for ferries to the island resorts at Redang and Perhentian islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expressbusmalaysia.com/bus-stations/kuala-terengganu-terminal-mpkt|title=Kuala Terengganu Terminal (MPKT)|publisher=Express Bus Malaysia|access-date=25 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409043545/http://www.expressbusmalaysia.com/bus-stations/kuala-terengganu-terminal-mpkt|archive-date=9 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Kuala Terengganu has its own special bus service known as ''Bas Bandar'' or Town Bus, operated by the state-owned firm ''Cas Ligas Sdn. Bhd.'' The buses have the characteristics of a traditional old Malay house through the unique roof design to reflect the state cultural identity. The buses cover three lines in and out of the city. A token fare of MYR1 should be paid for each ride.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.casligas.com.my/v1/|title=Cas Ligas Sdn.

There are also [[trishaw]] services although this service is dying fast and is not as extensive as the ones in the states of [[Malacca]] and [[Penang]]. In Kuala Terengganu, pedestrian-pulled rickshaws were gradually replaced by trishaws (beca in Malay). Trishaws were ubiquitous up to the 1970s in cities. Since then, rapid urbanisation has increased demand for more efficient public transport, resulting in dwindling trishaw numbers. Today, trishaws are operated mostly as a tourist attraction in Kuala Terengganu.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kosmo.com.my/kosmo/content.asp?y=2015&dt=0318&pub=Kosmo&sec=Terkini&pg=bt_16.htm|title=Pemilik beca, bot penambang di Terengganu terima insentif RM200 sebulan|language=ms|work=Bernama|publisher=[[Kosmo!]]|date=18 March 2015|access-date=9 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sinarharian.com.my/edisi/terengganu/tak-ramai-minat-naik-beca-1.289975|title=Tak ramai minat naik beca|author=Norhafiza Musa|language=ms|publisher=[[Sinar Harian]]|date=14 June 2014|access-date=23 March 2015}}</ref> The city's only taxi rank stands nearby to the city's bus terminal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spad.gov.my/transport-operators/taxis/directory|title=Directory for Taxis|publisher=Land Public Transport Commission|access-date=25 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409050032/http://www.spad.gov.my/transport-operators/taxis/directory|archive-date=9 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

As with the rest of Terengganu, [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu]] (KTM) does not serve Kuala Terengganu. Nevertheless, this is about to change as the [[East Coast Rail Link]] (ECRL) project, has commenced and is slated to connect Kuala Terengganu with [[Tumpat District|Tumpat]] and [[Kota Bharu]] in Kelantan, [[Kuantan]] in Pahang, and [[Gombak]] in Kuala Lumpur by 2024.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017/08/09/ecrl-construction-under-way/|title=ECRL construction under way|author=Ong Han Sean|work=The Star|date=9 August 2017|access-date=28 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/2017/08/09/ecrl-project-game-changer-malaysia-pm-najib-updated-0|title=ECRL project a game changer for Malaysia: PM Najib (Updated)|work=Bernama|publisher=The Sun|date=9 August 2017|access-date=28 July 2018}}</ref>

Kuala Terengganu is also the first city in the East Coast to have a public [[bicycle-sharing system]]. This service is provided the Singaporean operator, [[oBike]]. Like all other cities with oBike, the system has no docking stations. Instead the bikes have a built-in Bluetooth lock and can therefore be left anywhere at the end of a journey. Users use a smartphone app to locate and hire bikes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utusan.com.my/berita/wilayah/36-unit-basikal-obike-di-kuala-terengganu-dirosakkan-1.574815|title=36 unit basikal oBike di Kuala Terengganu dirosakkan|language=ms|work=Utusan Malaysia|date=18 December 2017|access-date=28 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bharian.com.my/berita/wilayah/2017/09/321975/enam-lokasi-bebas-karbon|title=Enam lokasi bebas karbon|author=Baharom Bakar|language=ms|publisher=Berita Harian|date=6 September 2017|access-date=28 July 2018}}</ref>
