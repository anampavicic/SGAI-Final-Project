'''Puri''', also known as, '''Jagannath Puri''', ({{IPA-or|ˈpuɾi|lang|Puri.ogg}}) is a [[coast]]al city and a [[Nagar Palika|municipality]] in the state of [[Odisha]] in eastern [[India]]. It is the district headquarters of [[Puri district]] and is situated on the [[Bay of Bengal]], {{convert|60|km|mi|0}} south of the state capital of [[Bhubaneswar]]. It is home to the 12th-century [[Jagannath Temple (Puri)|Jagannath Temple]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://epaper.thestatesman.com/m5/3725372/Dainik-Statesman/28TH-JUNE-2023|title=পুরীধাম ও জগন্নাথদেবের ব্রহ্মরূপ বৃত্তান্ত|page=4|language=bn|date=28 June 2023|access-date=28 June 2023|website=dainikstatesmannews.com|publisher=[[Dainik Statesman]] (The Statesman Group)|location=Kolkata|first=Yogabrata|last=Chakraborty|trans-title=Puridham and the tale of lord Jagannath's legendary 'Bramharup'|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230628053933/https://epaper.thestatesman.com/m5/3725372/Dainik-Statesman/28TH-JUNE-2023#page/1/1|archive-date=28 June 2023|url-status=bot: unknown}}</ref> and is one of the original [[Char Dham]]  pilgrimage sites for [[Hindus]].

Puri has been known by several names since ancient times, and was locally known as "Sri Kshetra" and the [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath temple]] is known as "Badadeula". Puri and the Jagannath Temple were invaded 18 times by Muslim rulers, from the 7th century AD until the early 19th century with the objective of looting the treasures of the temple. Odisha, including Puri and its temple, were part of [[British India]] from 1803 until India attained independence in August 1947. Even though [[princely states]] do not exist in India today, the heirs of the [[House of Gajapati]] still perform the ritual duties of the temple. The temple town has many Hindu religious [[Matha|''matha''s]] or monasteries.

The economy of Puri is dependent on the religious importance of the [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple]] to the extent of nearly 80 percent. The 24 festivals, including 13 major ones, held every year in the temple complex contribute to the economy; [[Ratha Yatra]] and its related festivals are the most important which are attended by millions of people every year. [[Sand art and play|Sand art]] and [[applique]] art are some of the important crafts of the city.

Puri has been chosen as one of the heritage cities for [[Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana]] (HRIDAY) scheme of Government of India.

Puri is a significant part of the "Krishna pilgrimage circuit" which also includes [[Mathura]], [[Vrindavan]], [[Barsana]], [[Gokul]], [[Govardhan]], [[Kurukshetra]] and [[Dwarka]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Development of Ramayana and Krishna Circuits |url=https://pib.gov.in/pib.gov.in/Pressreleaseshare.aspx?PRID=1513307 |website=pib.gov.in |access-date=20 August 2022}}</ref>

==History==
{{For timeline}}

===Names in history===
Puri, the holy land of [[Jagannatha]], also known by the popular vernacular name Srikshetram, has many ancient names in the Hindu scriptures such as the [[Rigveda]], [[Matsya purana]], [[Brahma Purana]], [[Narada Purana]], [[Padma Purana]], [[Skanda Purana]], [[Kapila Purana]] and Niladrimahodaya. In the Rigveda, in particular, it is mentioned as a place called Purushamandama-grama meaning the place where the Creator deity of the world – Supreme Divinity deified on an altar or [[mandapa]] was venerated near the coast and prayers offered with [[Vedic hymns]]. Over time the name got changed to Purushottama Puri and further shortened to Puri, and the Purusha came to be known as Jagannatha. Sages like [[Bhrigu]], [[Atri]] and [[Markandeya]] had their hermitage close to this place.{{Sfn|Mahanti|2014|p=xxix}} Its name is mentioned, conforming to the deity worshipped, as [[Srikshetra]], Purusottama Dhāma, [[Purusottama Kshetra]], Purusottama Puri and [[Jagannath Puri]]. Puri, however, is the popular usage. It is also known by the geographical features of its location as [[Shankhakshetra]] (the layout of the town is in the form of a conch shell),{{Sfn|Mahanti|2014|p=xxx}} Neelāchala ("Blue mountain" a terminology used to name a very large sand lagoon over which the temple was built but this name is not in vogue), Neelāchalakshetra, [[Neelādri]].{{Sfn|Mahanti|2014|p=xxxi}} In [[Sanskrit Language|Sanskrit]], the word "Puri" means town or city,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Glashoff |first1=Klaus |url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&tinput=puri&trans=Translate&direction=SE |title=Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit |publisher=Spokensanskrit.de |access-date=19 September 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003141324/http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&tinput=puri&trans=Translate&direction=SE |archive-date=3 October 2011 }}</ref> and is cognate with ''polis'' in [[Greek language|Greek]].{{Sfn|Ananda|2015|p=11}}

Another ancient name is Charita as identified by General [[Alexander Cunningham]] of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]], which was later spelled as Che-li-ta-lo by Chinese traveller [[Hiuen Tsang]]. When the present temple was built by the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Eastern Ganga]] king [[Anantavarman Chodaganga]] in the 11th and 12th centuries AD, it was called Purushottamkshetra. However, the [[Mughal people|Moghul]]s, the [[Marathas]] and early [[British Raj|British ruler]]s called it Purushottama-chhatar or just Chhatar. In Moghul ruler [[Akbar]]'s [[Ain-i-Akbari]] and subsequent Muslim historical records it was known as Purushottama. In the Sanskrit drama ''Anargha Raghava Nataka'' as well, authored by Murari Mishra, a playwright, in the 8th century AD, it is referred to as Purushottama.{{Sfn|Mahanti|2014|p=xxx}} It was only after the 12th century AD that Puri came to be known by the shortened form of Jagannatha Puri, named after the deity or in a short form as Puri.{{Sfn|Mahanti|2014|p=xxxi}} It is the only shrine in India, where [[Radha]], along with [[Lakshmi]], [[Saraswati]], [[Durga]], [[Bhudevi]], [[Sati (goddess)|Sati]], [[Parvati]], and [[Shakti]], abodes with [[Krishna]], who is also known by the name [[Jagannath|Jagannatha]].<ref name="Jagannathyatra">{{cite web|title=Jagannathyatra|url=http://jagannathyatra.com/about_puri.html|publisher=Jagannathyatra|access-date=11 October 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017051306/http://jagannathyatra.com/about_puri.html|archive-date=17 October 2013}}</ref>

===Ancient period===
[[File:Watercolour painting on paper of Indradyumna seated in a carriage.jpg|right|thumb|King [[Indradyumna]] of [[Ujjayani]] credited with building the original Puri Jagannath temple in 318 AD]]
According to the chronicle [[Madala Panji]], in 318 AD, the priests and servitors of the temple spirited away the idols to escape the wrath of the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakuta]] king [[Govinda III|Rakatavahu]].{{Sfn|Mahanti|2014|p=7}} In the temple's historical records it finds mention in the Brahma Purana and Skanda Purana stating that the temple was built by the king [[Indradyumna]], [[Ujjayani]].{{Sfn|Kapoor|2002|p=5890}}

S. N. Sadasivan, a historian, in his book ''A Social History of India'' quotes William Joseph Wilkins, author of the book ''Hindu Mythology, Vedic and Purānic'' as stating that in Puri, [[Buddhism]] was once a well established practice but later [[Buddhism]] faded and [[Brahmanism]] became the order of the religious practice in the town; the [[Buddha]] deity is now worshipped by the Hindus as Jagannatha. It is also said by Wilkinson that some relics of Buddha were placed inside the idol of Jagannatha which the Brahmins claimed were the bones of Krishna. Even during [[Maurya dynasty|Maurya]] king [[Ashoka]]'s reign in 240 BC, [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] was a Buddhist center and that a tribe known as Lohabahu (barbarians from outside Odisha) converted to Buddhism and built a temple with a statue of Buddha which is now worshipped as Jagannatha. Wilkinson also says that the Lohabahu deposited some Buddha relics in the precincts of the temple.{{Sfn|Sadasivan|2000|p=211}}

Construction of the present Jagannath Temple started in 1136 AD and completed towards the latter part of the 12th century. The [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Eastern Ganga]] king [[Anangabhima III]] dedicated his kingdom to Jagannatha, then known as the Purushottama-Jagannatha, and resolved that from then on he and his descendants would rule under "divine order as Jagannatha's sons and vassals". Even though [[princely state]]s do not exist in India today, the heirs of the [[Puri Estate]] still perform the ritual duties of the temple; the king formally sweeps the road in front of the chariots before the start of the [[Ratha Yatra]]. This ritual is called Cherra Pahanra.{{Sfn|Ring|Salkin|Boda|1994|p=699}}

===Medieval and early modern periods===
The history of Puri is on the same lines as that of the Jagannath Temple, which was invaded 18 times during its history to plunder the treasures of the temple, rather than for religious reasons. The first invasion occurred in the 8th century AD by Rastrakuta king [[Govinda III]] (798–814 AD), and the last took place in 1881 AD by the [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] followers of ''Alekh'' ([[Mahima Dharma]]) who did not recognise the worship of Jagannatha.{{Sfn|Dash|2011|p=82}} From 1205 AD onward {{Sfn|Ring|Salkin|Boda|1994|p=699}} there were many invasions of the city and its temple by Muslims of [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] and Moghul descent, known as [[Yavanas]] or foreigners. In most of these invasions the idols were taken to safe places by the priests and the servitors of the temple. Destruction of the temple was prevented by timely resistance or surrender by the kings of the region. However, the treasures of the temple were repeatedly looted.{{Sfn|Mahanti|2014|p=xliii7}} The table lists all the 18 invasions along with the status of the three images of the temple, the triad of Jagannatha, Balabhadra and Subhadra following each invasion.{{Sfn|Dash|2011|p=82}}

Puri is the site of the [[Govardhana matha|Govardhana Matha]], one of the four cardinal institutions established by [[Adi Shankaracharya]], when he visited Puri in 810 AD, and since then it has become an important ''dham'' (divine centre) for the Hindus; the others being those at [[Sringeri]], [[Dwarka]] and [[Jyotirmath]]. The ''Matha'' (monastery of various Hindu sects) is headed by [[Shankaracharya|Jagatguru Shankarachrya]]. It is a local belief about these dhams that Vishnu takes his dinner at Puri, has his bath at [[Rameshwaram]], spends the night at Dwarka and does penance at [[Badrinath]].{{Sfn|Kapoor|2002|p=5890}}{{Sfn|Mahanti|2014|p=xxxii}}

In the 16th century, [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] of [[Bengal]] established the [[Bhakti]] movements of India, now known by the name the [[Hare Krishna movement]]. He spent many years as a devotee of Jagannatha at Puri; he is said to have merged with the deity.{{Sfn|Ring|Salkin|Boda|1994|p=697}} There is also a ''matha'' of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu here known as [[Radhakanta Math]].{{Sfn|Kapoor|2002|p=5890}}

In the 17th century, for the sailors sailing on the east coast of India, the temple served as a landmark, being located in a plaza in the centre of the city, which they called the "White Pagoda" while the [[Konark Sun Temple]], {{Convert|60| km}} away to the east of Puri, was known as the "Black Pagoda".{{Sfn|Ring|Salkin|Boda|1994|p=697}}

The iconic representation of the images in the Jagannath temple is  believed to be the forms derived from the worship made by the tribal groups of [[Sabaras]] belonging to northern Odisha. These images are replaced at regular intervals as the wood deteriorates. This replacement is a special event carried out ritualistically by special group of carpenters.{{Sfn|Ring|Salkin|Boda|1994|p=697}}
[[File:Goverdhana matha.jpg|thumb|[[Govardhana matha]] main gate]]
The city has many other ''Mathas'' as well. The [[Emar Matha]] was founded by the [[Tamil Nadu|Tamil]] [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] saint [[Ramanujacharya]] in the 12th century AD. This Matha, which is now located in front of Simhadvara across the eastern corner of the Jagannath Temple, is reported to have been built in the 16th century during the reign of kings of [[Gajapati Kingdom|Suryavamsi Gajapati]]s. The Matha was in the news on 25 February 2011 for the large cache of 522 silver slabs unearthed from a closed chamber.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ignca.nic.in/asi_reports/orpuri117.pdf|title=Documentation format for Archaeological / Heritage Sites / Monuments|work=Emar Matha, Puri town|access-date=25 September 2015|publisher=Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001172142/http://ignca.nic.in/asi_reports/orpuri117.pdf|archive-date=1 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article1493118.ece|title=Hidden treasure' worth Rs. 90 crores found in Puri's Emar Mutt|access-date=25 September 2015|date=28 February 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023222343/http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article1493118.ece|archive-date=23 October 2012}}</ref>

The British conquered Orissa in 1803, and, recognizing the importance of the Jagannath Temple in the life of the people of the state, they initially appointed an official to look after the temple's affairs and later declared the temple as part of a district.{{Sfn|Ring|Salkin|Boda|1994|p=699}}

===Modern history===
[[File:Jagat Guru Sankaracharya Nischalananda Saraswati.jpg|thumb|H.H Jagadguru  Swami Nischalananda Saraswati, The Shankaracharya of Puri]]
In 1906, [[Sri Yukteswar]], an exponent of [[Kriya Yoga school|Kriya Yoga]] and a resident of Puri, established an [[ashram]], a spiritual training center, named "Karar Ashram"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kriya Yoga Teaching & Meditation Centre {{!}} Karar Ashram |url=http://www.kararashram.org/ |access-date=20 August 2022 |website=kararashram.org |archive-date=1 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221201103922/http://kararashram.org/ |url-status=live }}</ref> in Puri. He died on 9 March 1936 and his body is buried in the garden of the ashram.{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=248}}{{Sfn|Davis|1997|p=265}}

The city is the site of the former summer residence of British Raj, the [[Raj Bhavan (Puri)|Raj Bhavan]], built in 1913–14 during the era of governors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rajbhavanodisha.gov.in/rajbhavanpuri.asp|title=Raj Bhavan, Puri|access-date=25 September 2015|publisher=Official website of rajbhavan|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121021301/http://www.rajbhavanodisha.gov.in/rajbhavanpuri.asp|archive-date=21 November 2015}}</ref>

For the people of Puri, [[Jagannath|Jagannatha]], visualized as [[Krishna]], is synonymous with their city. They believe that Jagannatha looks after the welfare of the state. However, after the partial collapse of the Jagannath Temple (in the [[Amalaka]] part of the temple) on 14 June 1990, people became apprehensive and considered it a bad omen for Odisha. The replacement of the fallen stone by another of the same size and weight ({{Convert|7|tonne}}), that could be done only in the early morning hours after the temple gates were opened, was done on 28 February 1991.{{Sfn|Ring|Salkin|Boda|1994|p=697}}

Puri has been chosen as one of the heritage cities for the [[Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana]] scheme of the Indian Government. It is chosen as one of the 12 [[Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana|heritage cities]] with "focus on holistic development" to be implemented within 27 months by the end of March 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hridayindia.in/|title=Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana|access-date=30 September 2015|publisher=HRIDAY National Project Management Unit National Institute of Urban Affairs|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150826075658/http://hridayindia.in/|archive-date=26 August 2015}}</ref>

Non-Hindus are not permitted to enter the shrines but are allowed to view the temple and the proceedings from the roof of the Raghunandan library, located within the precincts of the temple, for a small donation.{{Sfn|Bindloss|Brown| Elliott |2007|p=253}}

It is delimited by the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, the Mauza Sipaurubilla on the west, [[Gopinathpur, Baleshwar|Mauza Gopinathpur]] in the north and Mauza Balukhand in the east. It is within the {{Convert|67|km}} coastal stretch of sandy beaches that extends between [[Chilika Lake]] and the south of Puri city. However, the administrative jurisdiction of the Puri Municipality extends over an area of {{Convert|16.3268|km2}} spread over 30 wards, which includes a shore line of {{Convert|5|km}}.{{Sfn|Managers|2006|p=1–2}}

Puri is in the coastal delta of the [[Mahanadi River]] on the shores of the Bay of Bengal. In the ancient days it was near to [[Sisupalgarh]] (also known as "Ashokan Tosali"). Then the land was drained by a [[tributary]] of the [[Bhargavi River]], a branch of the Mahanadi River. This branch underwent a meandering course creating many arteries altering the [[estuary]], and formed many sand hills. These sand hills could be cut through by the streams. Because of the sand hills, the Bhargavi River, flowing to the south of Puri, moved away towards the [[Chilika Lake]]. This shift also resulted in the creation of two [[lagoons]], known as Sar and Samang, on the eastern and northern parts of Puri respectively. Sar lagoon has a length of {{Convert|5|mi}} in an east–west direction and a width of {{Convert|2|mi}} in north–south direction. The estuary of the Bhargavi River has a shallow depth of just {{Convert|5|ft}} and the process of siltation continues. According to a 15th-century [[Odia language|Odia]] writer [[Sarala Das|Saraladasa]], the bed of the unnamed stream that flowed at the base of the Blue Mountain or ''Neelachal'' was filled up. ''Katakarajavamsa'', a 16th-century chronicle (c.1600), attributes filling up of the bed of the river which flowed through the present Grand Road, as done during the reign of King Narasimha II (1278–1308) of [[Eastern Ganga dynasty]].{{Sfn|Starza|1993|p=1}}

[[File:Jagannath Temple, Puri 01.jpg|thumb|The main entrance of the Jagannath Temple]]
According to a legend King Indradyumma was directed by Jagannatha in a dream to build a temple for him which he did as directed. However, according to historical records the temple was started some time during the 12th century by King Chodaganga of the Eastern Ganga dynasty. It was completed by his descendant, Anangabhima Deva, in the 12th century. The wooden images of Jagannatha, Balabhadra and Subhadra were then deified here. The temple was under the control of the Hindu rulers up to 1558. Then, when Orissa was occupied by the Afghan Nawab of Bengal, it was brought under the control of the Afghan General Kalapahad. Following the defeat of the Afghan king by [[Raja Mansingh]], the General of Mughal emperor [[Akbar]], the temple became part of the [[Mughal empire]] till 1751. Subsequently, it was under the control of the Marathas till 1803. During the British Raj, the Puri Raja was entrusted with its management until 1947.<ref name=Seven/>

The triad of images in the temple are of Jagannatha, personifying Krishna, Balabhadra, His older brother, and Subhadra, His younger sister. The images are made of neem wood in an unfinished form. The stumps of wood which form the images of the brothers have human arms, while that of Subhadra does not have any arms. The heads are large, painted and non-carved. The faces are marked with distinctive large circular eyes.{{Sfn|Ring|Salkin|Boda|1994|p=697}}

The Jagannath Temple triad are normally worshipped in the sanctum of the temple at Puri, but once during the month of [[Asadha]] (rainy season of Orissa, usually in June or July), they are brought out on the Bada Danda (main street of Puri) and taken over a distance of ({{Convert|3|km}}) to the [[Gundicha Temple]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roaddistance.in/odisha/bada-danda-puri-puri-to-gundicha-temple-puri-distance/by-road/ |title=Bada Danda Puri Puri and Gundicha Temple Puri by Road, Distance Between Bada Danda Puri Puri and Gundicha Temple Puri, Distance by Road from Bada Danda Puri Puri and Gundicha Temple Puri with Travel Time, Gundicha Temple Puri Distance from Bada Danda Puri Puri, Driving Direction Calculator from bada danda puri puri and gundicha temple puri |access-date=6 July 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818091839/http://www.roaddistance.in/odisha/bada-danda-puri-puri-to-gundicha-temple-puri-distance/by-road/ |archive-date=18 August 2016 }}</ref> in huge chariots (''ratha''), allowing the public to have [[darśana]] (holy view).

Historically, the ruling Ganga dynasty instituted the Ratha Yatra on the completion of the Jagannath Temple around 1150 AD. This festival was one of those Hindu festivals that was reported to the Western world very early.{{Sfn|Starza|1993|p = 133}} [[Odoric of Pordenone|Friar Odoric]], in his account of 1321, reported how the people put the "idols" on chariots, and the King, the Queen and all the people drew them from the "church" with song and music.{{Sfn|Starza|1993|p=129}}{{Sfn|Das|1982|p=48}}

The Rathas are huge wooden structures provided with large wheels, which are built anew every year and are pulled by the devotees. The chariot for Jagannatha is about {{Convert|45|ft}} high and {{Convert|35|ft2}} and takes about 2 months for its construction.{{Sfn|Starza|1993|p = 16}} The chariot is mounted with 16 wheels, each of {{Convert|7|ft}} diameter. The carving in the front face of the chariot has four wooden horses drawn by [[Maruti Nandan|Maruti]]. On its other three faces, the wooden carvings are of [[Rama]], [[Surya]] and Vishnu. The chariot is known as Nandi Ghosha. The roof of the chariot is covered with yellow and red coloured cloth. The next chariot is of Balabhadra which is {{Convert|44|ft}} in height fitted with 14 wheels. The chariot is carved with [[Satyaki]] as the charioteer, roof covered in red and green coloured cloth, and the chariot is known as Taladhwaja. The carvings on this chariot include images of [[Narasimha]] and [[Rudra]] as Jagannatha's companions. The next chariot in the order is of Subhadra, which is {{Convert|43|ft}} in height supported on 12 wheels, roof covered in black and red colour cloth, and the chariot is known as Darpa Dalaan and the charioteer carved is [[Arjuna]]. Other images carved on the chariot are of [[Vana Durga]], [[Tara (Devi)|Tara Devi]] and [[Chandi Devi]].<ref name=Barik/><ref name=Chariot>{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sDmwCcLza2AC&pg=PA1077|year=1999|publisher=Sarup & Sons|isbn=978-81-7625-064-1|pages=1076–77|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303152455/https://books.google.com/books?id=sDmwCcLza2AC&pg=PA1077|archive-date=3 March 2018}}</ref> The artists and painters of Puri decorate the cars and paint flower petals and other designs on the wheels, the wood-carved charioteer and horses, and the inverted lotuses on the wall behind the throne.{{Sfn|Das|1982|p = 40}} The chariots of Jagannatha pulled during Ratha Yatra is the etymological origin of the [[English language|English]] word [[Juggernaut]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Juggernaut-Definition and Meaning|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/juggernaut|publisher=Merriam Webster Dictionary|access-date=28 November 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107120441/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/juggernaut|archive-date=7 November 2012}}</ref> The Ratha Yatra is also termed as the Shri Gundicha yatra and Ghosha yatra<ref name=Barik/>

During this ritual, the Gajapati King wears the outfit of a sweeper and sweeps all around the deities and chariots. The king cleans the road in front of the chariots with a gold-handled broom and sprinkles [[sandalwood]] water and powder. As per the custom, although the Gajapati King has been considered the most exalted person in [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|the Kalingan kingdom]], he still renders the menial service to Jagannatha. This ritual signifies that under the lordship of Jagannatha, there is no distinction between the powerful sovereign and the humblest devotee.<ref>{{cite news|last=Karan|first=Jajati|title=Lord Jagannatha yatra to begin soon|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/lord-jagannath-yatra-to-begin-soon/68263-3-2.html|access-date=28 November 2012|newspaper=IBN Live|date=4 July 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714215117/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/lord-jagannath-yatra-to-begin-soon/68263-3-2.html|archive-date=14 July 2014}}</ref>

====Snana Yatra====
{{main|Snana Yatra}}
Every year, on the [[Full Moon|Purnima]] day in the Hindu calendar month of [[Jyestha]] (June), the triad images of the Jagannath Temple are ceremonially bathed and decorated on the occasion of Snana Yatra. Water for the bath is taken in 108 pots from the ''Suna kuan'' (meaning: "golden well") located near the northern gate of the temple. Water is drawn from this well only once in a year for the sole purpose of the religious bath of the deities. After the bath the triad images are dressed in the fashion of the elephant god, [[Ganesha]]. Later, during the night, the original triad images are taken out in a procession back to the main temple but kept at a place known as ''Anasara pindi''.<ref name=Barik/> After this the [[Jhulan Purnima|Jhulan Yatra]] is performed when proxy images of the deities are taken out in a grand procession for 21 days, cruised over boats in the Narendra Tirtha tank.{{Sfn|Kapoor|2002|p=5890}}

====Naba Kalebara====
{{main|Nabakalevara|Nabakalebara 2015}}
Naba Kalebara is one of the most grand events associated with the LJagannatha that takes place when one [[lunar month]] of Ashadha is followed by another of Ashadha called Adhika Masa (extra month). This can take place at an interval of 8, 12 or even 18 years. Literally meaning the "New Body" (Nava = New, Kalevar = Body) in Odia, the festival is witnessed by millions of people and the budget for this event generally exceeds $500,000. The event involves installation of new images in the temple and burial of the old ones in the temple premises at Koili Vaikuntha. During the [[Nabakalebara 2015|Nabakalebara ceremony held during July 2015]] the idols that were installed in the temple in 1996 were replaced by specially carved new images made of neem wood.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/state-editions/bhubaneswar/30988-puri-gearing-up-for-2015-nabakalebar.html |title=Puri gearing up for 2015 Nabakalebar |work=dailypioneer.com |year=2011 |quote=Nabakalebar ritual of Lord Jagannath to be held in 2015, |access-date=4 January 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714162629/http://www.dailypioneer.com/state-editions/bhubaneswar/30988-puri-gearing-up-for-2015-nabakalebar.html |archive-date=14 July 2014 }}</ref><ref name=Bije/> More than 3 million people are reported to have attended this festival.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gettyimages.ca/license/482086448|title=During the tight security of the millennium's first…|date=7 July 2015|access-date=3 February 2016|publisher=Gettyimages.ca|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208213121/http://www.gettyimages.ca/license/482086448|archive-date=8 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[Sandpainting|Sand art]] is a special art form that is created on the beaches of Puri. The art form is attributed to Balaram Das, a poet who lived in the 14th century. Sculptures of various gods and famous people are now created in sand by amateur artists. These are temporary in nature as they get washed away by waves. This art form has gained international fame in recent years. One of the famed sand artists of Odisha is [[Sudarshan Patnaik]]. He established the Golden Sand Art Institute in 1995, in the open air on the shores of Bay of Bengal, to provide training to students interested in this art form.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.odisha.gov.in/portal/ViewDetails.asp?vchglinkid=GL010&vchplinkid=PL060&vchslinkid=SL035|title=Sand Arts|access-date=28 September 2015|publisher=Government of Orissa|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926033747/http://www.odisha.gov.in/portal/ViewDetails.asp?vchglinkid=GL010&vchplinkid=PL060&vchslinkid=SL035|archive-date=26 September 2015}}</ref>{{Sfn|Mahanti|2014|p=xl}}

They prepare articles for decorating the deities in the temple for various festivals and religious ceremonies. The appliqué works are brightly colored and patterned fabric in the form of canopies, umbrellas, drapery, carry bags, flags, coverings of dummy horses and cows, and other household textiles; these are marketed in Puri. The cloth used is made in dark colours of red, black, yellow, green, blue and turquoise blue.{{Sfn|Naik|1996|pp=95–96}}

Earlier, when roads did not exist, people used to walk or travel by animal-drawn vehicles or carriages along beaten tracks to reach Puri. Travel was by riverine craft along the [[Ganges]] up to Calcutta, and then on foot or by carriages. It was only during the Maratha rule that the Jagannath Sadak (Road) was built around 1790. The [[East India Company]] laid the rail track from Calcutta to Puri, which became operational in 1898.{{Sfn|Mahanti|2014|p=xxxiii}} Puri is now well-connected by rail, road and air services.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QweqCQAAQBAJ&dq=Puri+is+now+well-connected+by+rail,+road+and+air+services.&pg=PR33|last=Mani|first=J.C.|title=The Saga of Jagannatha and Badadeula at Puri|year=2014|page=33|publisher=VIJ Books|isbn=9789382652458|access-date=19 March 2023|archive-date=8 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230408144524/https://books.google.com/books?id=QweqCQAAQBAJ&dq=Puri+is+now+well-connected+by+rail,+road+and+air+services.&pg=PR33|url-status=live}}</ref>
