'''Settat''' ({{langx|ar|سطات|siṭṭāt}}) is a city in [[Morocco]] between the national capital [[Rabat]] and [[Marrakesh]]. Settat is located {{cvt|83.9|km|mi}} by road south of the centre of [[Casablanca]], roughly an hour's drive.<ref name="GM">{{cite map|title= Maps|publisher=[[Google Maps]]}}</ref> It is the capital of [[Settat Province]] and is its largest city in both size and population. According to the [[2014 Moroccan census]], it had a population of 142,250 people,<ref name=census2014/> up from 116,570 people in the 2004 census.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lavieeco.com/documents_officiels/Recensement%20population.pdf|title=Recensement général de la population et de l'habitat de 2004|publisher=Haut-commissariat au Plan, Lavieeco.com|access-date=22 April 2012}}</ref> Settat is {{cvt|370|m|ft}} above sea level, built on a plateau surrounded by foothills in all directions.  The antiquities of Settat include the very old Ismailiya [[Kasbah]] distinguished by the statue of a steed which lies at the center of the city.

==History==
By choosing to build the [[Kasbah]] on the hilly site of Settat, 18th century Moroccan ruler [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Moulay Ismail]] would trigger the process of urbanization. Indeed, the building of the [[Kasbah]] brought order and security for travelers and residents supported the settlements near it. Moreover, by installing the first [[Caïd]] in the region which previously depended Caïd Doukkali and Rahmani, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Moulay Ismail]] formalized Settat status as capital of this region.{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}}

Settat became an administrative center in the early 18th century, due to its strategic position as an unavoidable passage between North and South. Thanks to the richness of the soil, it also prospered during the 18th and 19th centuries as an important trading center for agricultural products, attracting [[entrepreneur]]s. This was the case for Moroccan [[Jew]]s who settled here en masse in the 19th century, building their own neighborhood, the [[Mellah]], near the [[Kasbah]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}}

This development was disrupted in the early 20th century during the early chaos of the [[French colonial empire|French colonization]] when the [[Chaouia (Morocco)|Chaouia]] tribes rallied to [[Abdelhafid of Morocco|Moulay Hafid]]. However, under the French protectorate, the city of Settat had unprecedented urban development, as evidenced by the population boom it experienced from 1913 to 1925. This prosperity lasted until the early fifties when, as a result of the development of Casablanca, communications, and transportation, the city of Settat and other towns in the region have entered a period of semi-lethargy.{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}}

In the early 1990s, Settat was endowed with a university [[L'Université Hassan 1er de Settat]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uh1.ac.ma/|title=L'Université Hassan 1er de Settat|publisher=L’Université Hassan 1er de Settat|access-date=22 April 2012}}</ref> an international golf course,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldgolf.com/courses/morocco/settat-university-royal-golf-club.html|title=Settat University Royal Golf Club|publisher=Worldgolf.com|access-date=22 April 2012}}</ref> and a racetrack. Settat has undergone large-scale urban planning from the 1970s to become an important regional center. Settat is linked to [[Casablanca]] ({{convert|57|km|mi|disp=sqbr|abbr=on}} to the north) since 2001 by the A7 highway, and [[Marrakech]] ({{convert|146|km|mi|disp=sqbr|abbr=on}} to the south) since 2007.
