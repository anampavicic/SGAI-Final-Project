====Air connectivity====
{{Main|Tanga Airport}}
Tanga has a small airport and is currently served by only three regional airlines, providing scheduled services to [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Pemba Airport (Tanzania)|Pemba Island]] and [[Zanzibar Airport|Zanzibar]]. In 2014 the airport served less than 30,000 passengers.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.taa.go.tz/index.php/download/statisticts/10-consolidated-taa-traffic-statistics-up-to-2014/file|title = Consolidated TAA Traffic Statistics Up to 2014|access-date = 21 January 2016|website = taa.go.tz|publisher = Tanzania Airports Authority|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160127190135/http://www.taa.go.tz/index.php/download/statisticts/10-consolidated-taa-traffic-statistics-up-to-2014/file|archive-date = 27 January 2016}}</ref> There are also a small number of private airstrips in the surrounding area around the city that facilitate the private estates and surrounding industries.

====Road connectivity====
Tanga city lies approximately 250&nbsp;km from Chalinze on the A14 highway that runs from Chalinze to [[Mombasa]]. The town is 75&nbsp;km away from Segera which is a junction linking the A14 and the B1. The B1 highway is a bypass that links [[Moshi, Tanzania|Moshi]] and the northern corridor to Tanga.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.cowi.com/menu/service/RailwaysRoadsandAirports/Roadsandhighways/Documents/021-1500-011e-07a_low_roads%20and%20highways.pdf|title = Roads and Highways - COWI Group|access-date = 21 January 2016|website = cowi.com|page = 30|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160705205025/http://www.cowi.com/menu/service/RailwaysRoadsandAirports/Roadsandhighways/Documents/021-1500-011e-07a_low_roads%20and%20highways.pdf|archive-date = 2016-07-05|url-status = dead}}</ref>

====Port of Tanga====
{{Main|Port of Tanga}}
The port is historically the oldest operating harbour in the nation and its roots date back to around the 6th century.<ref name=tangaph>{{cite news|title=Hope for growth as Pangani builds new jetty|url=http://www.dailynews.co.tz/index.php/features/46161-hope-for-growth-as-pangani-builds-new-jetty|access-date=21 January 2016|agency=Daily News|publisher=Tanzania Standard News|date=19 January 2016}}</ref> The Port of Tanga is the second largest port in Tanzania and is a vital part to the city's initial development and economy. The port operates at 90% of its installed capacity and its main cargo is [[coal]] for the cement industry and is a new gateway for [[Crude oil|crude oil products]].<ref name=pmarsum>{{cite web|title=Tanzania Harbors Authority|url=http://www.pmaesa.org/media/docs/tanzania.pdf|website=pmaesa|publisher=Port Management Association of East and Southern Africa|access-date=23 December 2015}}</ref> The ports authority has major plans to upgrade the port increase capacity and provide an alternative route for cargo flowing into the country.<ref name=psa1>{{cite news|title=Tanzania to tackle Tanga congestion|url=http://www.portstrategy.com/news101/world/africa/tanzania-ports-set-for-expansion|access-date=23 December 2015|publisher=Port Strategy|date=1 December 2011}}</ref>

====Rail connectivity====
Tanga is the starting point of the narrow gauge [[Usambara Railway|northern railway network]] that ends in [[Arusha]]. Construction of this line was started in the 19th century by the Germans. In 2018, the Government of Tanzania invested 5.7 billion Tanzanian Shillings to rehabilitate the line. As of July 2019, diesel powered cargo trains are leaving Tanga Railway Station again and passenger transport between Tanga and Arusha is set to start in September 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=Why Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda are falling back to old railway |url=https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/news/1840340-5214560-98tujr/index.html |website=The Citizen |access-date=29 July 2019}}</ref>

==History==
===Early history===
The first communities that called Tanga home were the [[Digo people|Digo]] peoples and the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] states of the 11th to 16th Centuries. However, the earliest documentation about Tanga comes from the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]]. During their disruption of the previous trading links Tanga settlement remained a small trading post for the colonists during their occupation of the East African coast for 200 years between 1500 and 1700 when they were ousted .<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Erik|date=November 2002|title=Coastal East Africa and the Western Indian Ocean: Long-Distance Trade, Empire, Migration, and Regional Unity, 1750-1970|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1512492|journal=The History Teacher|volume=36|issue=1|pages=7–34|doi=10.2307/1512492|jstor=1512492 |issn=0018-2745}}</ref> The [[Sultanate of Zanzibar|Sultanate of Oman]] battled the Portuguese and gained control of the settlement by mid-1700 along with [[Mombasa]], [[Pemba Island]] and [[Kilwa Kisiwani]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = A Political Ecology of Land Use Change and Natural Resource Conflict in the Rukwa Valley, Southwestern Tanzania|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iMGlmimOh8sC|date = 2007-01-01|isbn = 9780549263838|first = Benjamin Chad|last = Yanda|pages = 14–16}}</ref> The town continued to act as a trading port for [[ivory]] and slaves under the sultan's rule.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Tanga {{!}} Tanzania|url = http://www.britannica.com/place/Tanga-Tanzania|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date = 2016-01-21}}</ref> Tanga continued to be a prosperous trading hub for slaves with the Arab world up until 1873 when the European powers invaded and occupied thus abolishing the slave trade that was no longer serving the colonial powers.<ref name=":0" />

===Tanga under German East Africa===
[[File:Der Hafen von Tanga um 1914. Illustrierte Geschichte des Weltkrieges 1914-15.jpg|thumb|Der Hafen von Tanga um 1914. Illustrierte Geschichte des Weltkrieges 1914-15]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA0850, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Tanga, Markstraße.jpg|thumb|270px|Usambara Street in Tanga between 1906 and 1918.]]
In the 19th Century, growing interests by Europeans for the [[Scramble for Africa]] brought the Germans to Tanga. The Germans bought the coastal strip of mainland Tanzania from the [[Sultan of Zanzibar]] in 1891. This takeover designated Tanga into a township and was the first establishment in [[German East Africa]].<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.meetingpointtanga.net/getfile.ashx?cid=289655&cc=3&refid=12 |title= Tanga Region Tourism Guide |access-date= 21 January 2016}}</ref> The town became the centre of German colonial administration before the establishment of [[Dar es Salaam]] in the early 20th century.

Tanga was chosen in 1889 as a military post of German East Africa, and it became a district office in 1891. The town saw rapid expansion and planned growth under the German occupation. A tram line was built in the city for domestic transport and a port was also built for exports. In 1896 the construction of the [[Usambara Railway]] began and was extended to [[Moshi, Tanzania|Moshi]] by 1912. Roads, bridges and the railway enabled industrial growth in the region and many buildings and bridges that are still in operation today in the town are from the German colonial period. The local economy was based mainly on the production of [[sisal]], which had been brought to the colony several years earlier, and population in the area grew rapidly.<ref>{{Cite web |title= Tanga History |url= http://tanga-line.tripod.com/ |website= tanga-line.tripod.com |access-date= 2016-01-21}}</ref>

=== Tanga under British occupation===
As the coastal town closest to [[East Africa Protectorate|British East Africa]], Tanga was on the front line of the [[East African campaign (World War I)|East African campaign]] at the beginning of [[World War I]]. On 4 November 1914 a landing by British and Empire forces was repelled in the [[Battle of Tanga]].<ref>{{Cite web |title= First World War.com - Battles - The Battle of Tanga, 1914 |url= http://www.firstworldwar.com/battles/tanga.htm |website= www.firstworldwar.com |access-date= 2016-01-21}}</ref> On 13 June 1916 the [[Royal Navy]] [[battleship]] {{HMS|Vengeance|1899|6}} and [[protected cruiser]]s {{HMS|Challenger|1902|2}} and {{HMAS|Pioneer||2}} bombarded Tanga. On 7 July the protected cruiser {{HMS|Talbot|1895|6}} and [[Monitor (warship)|monitor]] {{HMS|Severn|1914|2}} entered [[Manza Bay]]<ref name=Log>{{cite web |url= https://www.naval-history.net/OWShips-WW1-04-HMS_Manica.htm |title=HMS Manica – February to December 1916, UK out, German East Africa Campaign |work=Royal Navy Log Books of the World War 1 Era |publisher=Naval-History.net |access-date=9 January 2022}}</ref> and put troops ashore who occupied the town.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cato |first=Conrad |year=1919 |title=The Navy Everywhere |place=[[Constable & Robinson|Constable]] |publisher=London |url=https://www.naval-history.net/WW1Book-NavyEverywhere01.htm |page=}}{{page needed|date=January 2022}}</ref> After the War, Britain was given a League of Nations Mandate to prepare Tanganyika for independence and continued to develop Tanga in order to develop its agricultural potential, both to feed the population and so stave of the regular famines in the tetritory and for export. In 1919 Tanga was the country's fourth largest city, but at independence it was the second largest city after [[Dar es Salaam]].

===Post-independence===
In the early stages of independence, the [[Port of Tanga]] continued to be a gateway for the export of [[sisal]] from the region. However, following the adopting of the [[Ujamaa]] policy, global prices in sisal dwindling, the production that served the city's factories closed and the city lost its main source of income. With the government controlling the agriculture trade and the depreciation in the world prices of sisal the port began to lose revenue.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fibre stories: Sisal starts a comeback in Tanzania - International Year of Natural Fibres 2009|url = http://www.naturalfibres2009.org/en/stories/sisal.html|website = www.naturalfibres2009.org|access-date = 2016-01-21|first = Graeme|last = Thomas}}</ref>
