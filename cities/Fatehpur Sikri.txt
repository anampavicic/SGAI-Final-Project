'''Fatehpur Sikri''' ({{IPA|hi|ˈfətɛɦpʊɾ ˈsiːkɾiː|lang}}) is a town in the [[Agra District]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]]. Situated {{Convert|35.7|km|mi}} from the district headquarters of [[Agra]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Fatehpur Sikri |url=https://www.tajmahal.gov.in/fatehpur-sikri.aspx |website=www.tajmahal.gov.in |access-date=8 March 2022 |archive-date=8 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220308114239/https://www.tajmahal.gov.in/fatehpur-sikri.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref> Fatehpur Sikri itself was founded as the capital of the [[Mughal Empire]] in 1571 by [[Mughal emperors|Emperor]] [[Akbar]], serving this role from 1571 to 1585, when Akbar abandoned it due to a campaign in [[Punjab]] and was later completely abandoned in 1610.<ref name="Routlegde">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9A-EAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA82 |title=Dictionary of Islamic Architecture |author=Andrew Petersen |publisher=Routlegde |page=82 |isbn=9781134613656 |date=11 March 2002}}</ref>

The name of the city is derived from the village called ''Sikri'' which previously occupied the location. An [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI) excavation from 1999 to 2000 indicated that there was housing, temples and commercial centres here before Akbar built his capital. The region was settled by [[Shunga Empire|Sungas]] following their expansion. It was controlled by Sakarwar [[Rajput]]s from the 7th to 16th century CE until the [[Battle of Khanwa]] (1527).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Patil |first1=Devendrakumar Rajaram |title=The Antiquarian Remains in Bihar |date=1963 |publisher=Kashi Prasad Jayaswal Research Institute |page=75 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9xNXAAAAMAAJ&q=sakarwar+rajputs+fatehpur+sikri |language=en}}</ref>

The ''[[khanqah]]'' of [[Sheikh (Sufism)|Sheikh]] [[Salim Chishti]] existed earlier at this place. Akbar's son, [[Jahangir]], was born in the village of Sikri to his favourite wife [[Mariam-uz-Zamani]] in 1569,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hindu Shah|first1=Muhammad Qasim|title=Gulshan-I-Ibrahimi|page=223}}</ref> and, in that year, Akbar began construction of a religious compound to commemorate the Sheikh who had predicted the birth. After Jahangir's second birthday, he began the construction of a walled city and imperial palace here. The city came to be known as ''Fatehpur Sikri'', the "City of Victory", after Akbar's [[Mughal conquest of Gujarat|victorious Gujarat campaign in 1573]].

After occupying Agra in 1803, the [[East India Company]] established an administrative centre here and it remained so until 1850. In 1815, the [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Marquess of Hastings]] ordered the repair of monuments at Sikri.

Because of its historical importance as the capital of the Mughal Empire and its outstanding architecture, Fatehpur Sikri was awarded the status of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 1986.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fatehpur Sikri |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/255/ |website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |access-date=15 February 2022 |language=en |archive-date=15 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220215162920/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/255/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.makeheritagefun.com/30-years-world-heritage-site-fatehpur-sikri/#:~:text=Given%20its%20spectacular%20history%2C%20architecture%20and%20legacy%2C%20Fatehpur,in%201986%20under%20the%20criteria%20%28ii%2C%20iii%2C%20iv%29|title = 30 Years as World Heritage Site: Fatehpur Sikri|date = 22 March 2016|access-date = 13 January 2022|archive-date = 13 January 2022|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220113152418/https://www.makeheritagefun.com/30-years-world-heritage-site-fatehpur-sikri/#:~:text=Given%20its%20spectacular%20history%2C%20architecture%20and%20legacy%2C%20Fatehpur,in%201986%20under%20the%20criteria%20%28ii%2C%20iii%2C%20iv%29|url-status = live}}</ref>

==History==
Archaeological evidence points to settlement of the region since the [[Painted Grey Ware culture|Painted Grey Ware period]]. According to historian Syed Ali Nadeem Rezavi, the region flourished under [[Sunga]] rule and then under Sikarwar Rajputs, who built a fortress when they controlled the area from 7th to 16th century, until the [[Battle of Khanwa]] (1527). The area later came under the rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and many mosques were built at the place which grew in size during the period of the [[Khalji dynasty]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rezavi |first1=Syed Ali Nadeem |title=Sikri before Akbar |date=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-908256-8 |url=https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198084037.001.0001/acprof-9780198084037-chapter-2 |access-date=13 January 2020 |archive-date=13 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200113124948/https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198084037.001.0001/acprof-9780198084037-chapter-2 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Safvi |first1=Rana |title=The secrets about Fatehpur Sikri |url=https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/the-secrets-about-fatehpur-sikri/article21381895.ece |access-date=13 January 2020 |work=The Hindu |date=10 December 2017 |language=en-IN |archive-date=13 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200113125020/https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/the-secrets-about-fatehpur-sikri/article21381895.ece |url-status=live }}</ref>

Basing his arguments on the excavations by the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI) in 1999–2000 at the Chabeli Tila, senior [[Agra]] journalist Bhanu Pratap Singh said the antique pieces, statues, and structures all point to a lost "culture and religious site," more than 1,000 years ago. "The excavations yielded a rich crop of [[Jainism|Jain]] statues, hundreds of them, including the foundation stone of a temple with the date. The statues were a thousand years old of ''Bhagwan'' Adi Nath, ''Bhagwan'' [[Rishabhanatha|Rishabh Nath]], ''Bhagwan'' [[Mahavira|Mahavir]] and [[Yakshini#Yakshis in Jainism|Jain Yakshinis]]," said Swarup Chandra Jain, senior leader of the [[Jain community]]. Historian Sugam Anand states that there is proof of habitation, temples and commercial centres even before Akbar established it as his capital. He states that the open space on a ridge was used by Akbar to build his capital.<ref>{{citation |title=Fatehpur Sikri, that Mughal emperor Akbar established as his capital and is now a World Heritage site, was once a "flourishing trade and Jain pilgrimage centre", a new book says. |url=http://indiatimes.com/lifestyle/travel/fatehpur-sikri-a-jain-pilgrimage-centre-89615.html |work=[[India Times]] |date=17 July 2013 |access-date=30 March 2016 |archive-date=12 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112035638/http://www.indiatimes.com/lifestyle/travel/fatehpur-sikri-a-jain-pilgrimage-centre-89615.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{citation |title=Fatehpur Sikri was once a Jain pilgrimage centre: Book |url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/uttar-pradesh/fatehpur-sikri-was-once-a-jain-pilgrimage-centre-book_831821.html |work=[[Zee News]] |date=27 February 2013 |access-date=29 March 2016 |archive-date=13 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210213220745/https://zeenews.india.com/news/uttar-pradesh/fatehpur-sikri-was-once-a-jain-pilgrimage-centre-book_831821.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{citation |title=Fatehpur Sikri was once a Jain pilgrimage centre |url=http://www.freepressjournal.in/fatehpur-sikri-was-once-a-jain-pilgrimage-centre/154050 |work=[[The Free Press Journal]] |date=28 February 2013 }}</ref>

But preceding Akbar's appropriation of the site for his capital city, his predecessors [[Babur]] and [[Humayun]] did much to redesign Fatehpur Sikri's urban layout.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Petruccioli|first=Attilio|date=1984|title=The Process Evolved by Control Systems of Urban Design in the Mogul Epoch in India: The Case of Fatehpur Sikri|url=https://archnet.org/system/publications/contents/3483/original/DPC1425.pdf?1384775285|journal=Environmental Design|pages=18–27|via=ARCHNET|access-date=22 March 2018|archive-date=23 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323030657/https://archnet.org/system/publications/contents/3483/original/DPC1425.pdf?1384775285|url-status=dead}}</ref> Attilio Petruccioli, a scholar of Islamic architecture and Professor of Landscape Architecture at the [[Polytechnic University of Bari]], Italy, notes that "Babur and his successors" wanted "to get away from the noise and confusion of Agra [and] build an uninterrupted sequence of gardens on the free left bank of the Yamuna, linked both by boat and by land."<ref name=":0" /> Petruccioli adds that when such escapist landscapes are envisioned, the monument becomes the organising element of the city at large, partly due to its orientation at a significant location and partly due to its sheer size. [[Buland Darwaza]] was one such organising element, which at a height of 150 feet towered over the city and is now one of the most recognisable Mughal monuments in the country.<ref name=":0" />

The place was much loved by [[Babur]], who called it ''Shukri'' (Thanks), after its large lake that was used by Mughal armies.<ref name=Asher>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ctLNvx68hIC&pg=PA22|title=Architecture of Mughal India, Part 1, Volume|author=Catherine Ella Blanshard Asher|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1992|page=22|isbn=9780521267281}}</ref> [[Annette Beveridge]] in her translation of ''[[Baburnama]]'' noted that Babur [[diacritic|points]] "Sikri" to read "Shukri".<ref>{{cite book|title=Babur-nama: (Memoirs of Babur)|author=Annette Susannah Beveridge|publisher= Sang-e-Meel Publications, University of Michigan Press|year=2002|page=851|isbn=9789693512939}}</ref> Per his memoirs, Babur constructed a garden here called the "Garden of Victory" after defeating [[Rana Sangha]] at its outskirts. [[Gulbadan Begum]]'s ''Humayun-Nama'' describes that in the garden he built an octagonal pavilion which he used for relaxation and writing. In the center of the nearby lake, he built a large platform. A [[baoli]] exists at the base of a rock scarp about a kilometre from the [[Hiran Minar]]. This was probably the original site of a well-known [[Epigraphy|epigraph]] commemorating his victory.<ref name=Asher/>

[[Abul Fazl]] records Akbar's reasons for the foundation of the city in ''[[Akbarnama]]'': "In as much as his exalted sons (Salim and [[Murad Mirza (son of Akbar)|Murad]]) had been born at Sikri, and the God-knowing spirit of Shaikh Salim had taken possession thereof, his holy heart desired to give outward splendour to this spot which possessed spiritual grandeur. Now that his standards had arrived at this place, his former design was pressed forward, and an order was issued that the superintendents of affairs should erect lofty buildings for the special use of the Shahinshah."<ref>{{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of India, Volume 4|author=[[Edward James Rapson]], [[Sir Wolseley Haig]], [[Sir Richard Burn]], [[H. H. Dodwell|Henry Dodwell]], [[Mortimer Wheeler]]|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1963|page=103}}</ref>

Akbar remained heirless until 1569 when his son, who became known as [[Jahangir]], was born in the village of Sikri in 1569. Akbar began the construction of a religious compound in honour of the [[Chishti Order|Chisti saint]] [[Sheikh (Sufism)|Sheikh]] [[Salim Chishti|Salim]], who had predicted the birth of Jahangir. After Jahangir's second birthday, he began the construction of a walled city and imperial palace probably to test his son's stamina. By constructing his capital at the ''[[khanqah]]'' of Sheikh Salim, Akbar associated himself with this popular Sufi order and brought legitimacy to his reign through this affiliation.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ctLNvx68hIC&pg=PA51|title=Architecture of Mughal India, Part 1, Volume 4|author=Catherine Ella Blanshard Asher|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1992|pages=51–53|isbn=9780521267281}}</ref>

The city was founded in 1571 and was named after the village of Sikri which occupied the spot before. The [[Buland Darwaza]] was built in honour of his [[Akbar's conquest of Gujarat|successful campaign]] in [[Gujarat Sultanate|Gujarat]], when the city came to be known as ''Fatehpur Sikri'' - "The City of Victory". It was abandoned by Akbar in 1585 when he went to fight a campaign in Punjab. It was later completely abandoned by 1610. The reason for its abandonment is usually given as the failure of the water supply, though Akbar's loss of interest may also have been the reason since it was built solely on his whim.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9A-EAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA82|title=Dictionary of Islamic Architecture|author=Andrew Petersen|publisher=Routlegde|pages=82–84|isbn=9781134613656|date=11 March 2002}}</ref> [[Ralph Fitch]] described it as such, "Agra and Fatehpore Sikri are two very great cities, either of them much greater than London, and very populous. Between Agra and Fatehpore are 12 miles ([[Kos (unit)|Kos]]) and all the way is a market of victuals and other things, as full as though a man were still in a town, and so many people as if a man were in a market."<ref>{{cite book|title=Akbar the Great, Vol. III: Society and culture in 16th century India|author=Ashirbadi Lal Srivastava|publisher=Shiva Lal Agarwala|year=1973|page=10|author-link=Ashirbadi Lal Srivastava}}</ref>

Akbar visited the city only once in 1601 after abandoning it. [[William Finch (merchant)|William Finch]], visiting it 4–5 years after Akbar's death, stated, "It is all ruinate," writing, "lying like a waste desert."<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=04ellRQx4nMC&pg=PA179|title=Emperors of the Peacock Throne: The Saga of the Great Mughals|author=Abraham Eraly|publisher=Penguin Books India|year=200|page=179|isbn=9780141001432|author-link=Abraham Eraly}}</ref> During the epidemic of [[bubonic plague]] from 1616 to 1624, [[Jahangir]] stayed for three months here in 1619.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=04ellRQx4nMC&pg=PA284|title=Emperors of the Peacock Throne: The Saga of the Great Mughals|author=Abraham Eraly|publisher=Penguin Books India|year=2000|page=284|isbn=9780141001432|author-link=Abraham Eraly}}</ref> [[Muhammad Shah]] stayed here for some time and the repair works were started again.

==Architecture==
[[File:General Plan of Fatehpur Sikri City India 1917.jpg|thumb|250px|General plan of Fatehpur Sikri city in 1917.]]
Fatehpur Sikri sits on a rocky ridge, {{convert|3|km}} in length and {{convert|1|km|abbr=on}} wide, and the palace city is surrounded by a {{convert|6|km|abbr=on}} wall on three sides with the fourth bordered by a lake. The city is generally organised around this 40 m high ridge, and falls roughly into the shape of a rhombus. The general layout of the ground structures, especially the "continuous and compact pattern of gardens and services and facilities" that characterised the city leads urban archaeologists to conclude that Fatehpur Sikri was built primarily to afford leisure and luxury to its famous residents.<ref name=":0" />

The dynastic architecture of Fatehpur Sikri was modelled on [[Timurid architecture|Timurid forms and styles]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Islam: Art and Architecture|author=Markus Hattstein, Peter Delius|publisher=Könemann|year=2000|pages=466}}</ref> The city was built massively and preferably with red sandstone.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2R3a3KLl2IC&pg=PA1|title=Mughal Architecture|author=Moritz Herrmann|publisher=GRIN Verlag|year=2011|page=3|isbn=9783640930036}}</ref> Gujarati influences are also seen in its architectural vocabulary and decor of the palaces of Fatehpur Sikri.<ref>{{cite book|title=Mughal Architecture: An Outline of Its History and Development (1526-1858)|author=Ebba Koch|publisher=Prestel|year=1991|page=60|author-link=Ebba Koch}}</ref> The city's architecture reflects both the Hindu and Muslim form of domestic architecture popular in India at the time.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ctLNvx68hIC&pg=PA50|title=Architecture of Mughal India, Part 1, Volume 4|author=Catherine Ella Blanshard Asher|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1992|page=50|isbn=9780521267281}}</ref> The remarkable preservation of these original spaces allows modern archaeologists to reconstruct scenes of Mughal court life, and to better understand the hierarchy of the city's royal and noble residents.<ref name=":0" />

It is accessed through gates along the {{convert|5|mi}} long fort wall, namely, Delhi Gate, the Lal Gate, the Agra Gate and Birbal's Gate, Chandanpal Gate, The Gwalior Gate, the Tehra Gate, the Chor Gate, and the Ajmeri Gate. The palace contains summer palace and winter palace for [[Mariam-uz-Zamani|Queen Mariam-uz-Zamani]] commonly known as Jodha Bai.

Some of the important buildings in this city, both religious and secular are:

* [[Buland Darwaza]]: Set into the south wall of congregational mosque, the Buland Darwaza at Fatehpur Sikri is {{convert|54|m}} high, from the ground, gradually making a transition to a human scale in the inside. The gate was added around five years after the completion of the mosque {{Circa|1576-1577}} as a victory arch, to commemorate [[Akbar]]'s successful Gujarat campaign. It carries two inscriptions in the archway, one of which reads: "Isa, Son of Mariam said: The world is a bridge, pass over it, but build no houses on it. He who hopes for an hour may hope for eternity. The world endures but an hour. Spend it in prayer, for the rest is unseen". <br/>The central portico comprises three arched entrances, with the largest one, in the centre, is known locally as the Horseshoe Gate, after the custom of nailing horseshoes to its large wooden doors for luck. Outside the giant steps of the Buland Darwaza to the left is a deep well.
* [[Jama Masjid, Fatehpur Sikri|Jama Masjid]]: It is a ''[[Jama Mosque]]'' meaning the congregational mosque and was perhaps one of the first buildings to be constructed in the complex, as its epigraph gives [[Hijri year|AH]] 979 (A.D. 1571–72) as the date of its completion, with a massive entrance to the courtyard, the Buland Darwaza added some five years later. It was built in the manner of Indian mosques, with iwans around a central courtyard. A distinguishing feature is the row of ''[[chhatri]]'' over the sanctuary. There are three [[mihrab]]s in each of the seven bays, while the large central mihrab is covered by a dome, it is decorated with white marble [[inlay]], in geometric patterns.
* [[Tomb of Salim Chishti]]: A white marble encased tomb of the [[Sufi]] saint [[Salim Chishti]] (1478–1572), within the Jama Masjid's ''[[sahn]]'' (courtyard). The single-storey structure is built around a central square chamber, within which is the grave of the saint, under an ornate wooden canopy encrusted with [[mother-of-pearl]] mosaic. Surrounding it is a covered passageway for [[circumambulation]], with carved ''[[Jali]]s'', stone pierced screens all around with intricate geometric design and an entrance to the south. The tomb is influenced by earlier mausolea of the early 15th century [[Gujarat Sultanate]] period. Other striking features of the tomb are white marble serpentine [[Bracket (architecture)|bracket]]s, which support sloping [[eave]]s around the [[parapet]]. <br/> On the left of the tomb, to the east, stands a red sandstone tomb of [[Islam Khan I]], son of Shaikh Badruddin Chishti and grandson of Shaikh Salim Chishti, who became a general in the Mughal army in the reign of [[Jahangir]]. The tomb is topped by a dome and thirty-six small domed ''[[chattri]]s'' and contains a number of graves, some unnamed, all male descendants of Shaikh Salim Chishti.

* Diwan-i-Khas: the ''Diwan-i-Khas'' or Hall of Private Audience, is a plain square building with four ''chhatris'' on the roof. However it is famous for its central pillar, which has a square base and an octagonal shaft, both carved with bands of geometric and floral designs, further its thirty-six serpentine [[Bracket (architecture)|bracket]]s support a circular platform for Akbar, which is connected to each corner of the building on the first floor, by four stone walkways. It is here that Akbar had representatives of different religions discuss their faiths and gave private audience.

It also has a Hindu temple and a tulsi math used by his Hindu wife for worship. This palace was internally connected to the khawabgah of Akbar. 
* [[Naubat Khana]]: Also known as [[Naqqar Khana]] meaning a ''drum house'', where musician used drums to announce the arrival of the Emperor. It is situated ahead of the ''Hathi Pol Gate'' or the Elephant Gate, the south entrance to the complex, suggesting that it was the imperial entrance.

* [[Panch Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri|Panch Mahal]]: A five-storied palatial structure, with the tiers gradually diminishing in size, until the final one, which is a single large-domed [[chhatri]]. Originally pierced stone screens faced the facade and probably sub-divided the interior as well, suggesting it was built for the ladies of the court. The floors are supported by intricately carved columns on each level, totalling to 176 columns in all.

[[Vita Sackville-West]], in her novel ''[[All Passion Spent]]'', places the key meeting between Deborah, Lady Slane, and Mr FitzGeorge, at Fatehpur Sikri. 
<blockquote>
She stood again on the terrace of the deserted Indian city looking across the brown landscape where puffs of rising dust marked at intervals the road to Agra. She leaned her arms upon the warm parapet and slowly twirled her parasol. She twirled it because she was slightly ill at ease. She and the young man beside her were isolated from the rest of the world.<ref>From ''All Passion Spent'' (Hogarth Press,1931)</ref>
