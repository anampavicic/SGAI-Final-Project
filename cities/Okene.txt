==History==
Okene Local Government Area was created in 1976 from the then Ebira Division by the Administration of General [[Olusegun Obasanjo]], following the 1976 Local Government Reform. Ajaokuta and Ogori-Magongo LGAs were created from the old Okene LGA in 1991 and 1996 respectively. The people of Okene Local Government Area are a part of Ebira Tao people of the Central Senatorial District of Kogi State.

They are believed to have migrated from Jukun in the present day [[Taraba State]] and had a brief stopover in [[Idah]] before moving to their current location. The present Okene LGA is composed of Okene and Okengwe districts. There are 11 wards in the Local Government, namely Bariki, Otutu, Orietesu, Lafia/Obessa, Okene-Eba, Idoji, Onyukoko, Obehira-Eba, Obehira-Uvete, Abuga/Ozuja and Upogoro/Odenku wards. The population is predominantly Muslims, but a sizeable Christian minority also exists. To a great extent, there is a fusion of tradition and religions with only a negligible few still practicing exclusively traditional religion.

One of the most popular attractions in the town is the ''Azad Palace'', which is the personal property of the Ohinoyi (King) of Ebiraland, Dr. [[Ado Ibrahim|Ado Ibrahim Atta]], who is now late.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ohinoyi of Ebiraland dies at 95 |url=https://www.channelstv.com/2023/10/29/ohinoyi-of-ebiraland-ado-ibrahim-dies-at-95/ |access-date=July 3, 2024 |website=Channels TV}}</ref>
