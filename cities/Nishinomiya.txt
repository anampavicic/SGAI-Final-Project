== History ==
The area of Nishinomiya was part of ancient [[Settsu Province]] and has been inhabited since ancient times, with the traces of [[Yayoi period]] settlements, many [[kofun]] [[burial mound]]s found within the city limits. From the [[Asuka period]], the [[Hirota Shrine]] was built, and the market town which developed around its west gate was the ancestor of "Nishinomiya". From the [[Muromachi period]], Nishinomiya was famed for its production of ''[[sake]]''. During the [[Edo Period]], the area was ''[[tenryō]]'' territory under the direct administration of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. The town of Nishinomiya was established on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. Nishinomiya was a center of the culture from the 1910s to 1940s in which has been dubbed "[[Hanshinkan Modernism]]". This included the opening of the [[Kōshien Stadium]] opened on April 1, 1924. Nishinomiya was elevated to city status on April 1, 1925. The city expanded with the annexation of the town of Imazu and villages of Shiba and Taishi in April 1933, the village of Koto in February 1941, the village of Kawaragi in May 1942, and the villages of Naruo, Yamaguchi and Shiose in April 1951. The January 17, 1995 [[Great Hanshin earthquake]] caused widespread damage in Nishinomiya.
