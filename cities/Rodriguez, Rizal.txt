'''Rodriguez''', officially the '''Municipality of Rodriguez''' ({{lang-tgl|Bayan ng Rodriguez}}) and commonly known by its former name '''Montalban''', is a 1st class [[Greater Manila Area|urban]] [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 443,954 people{{PH census|current}} making it the most populous municipality in the country. Pending an affirmation through plebiscite, Republic Act No. 11812 repealed Batas Pambansa Blg. 275 and intend to formally revert to its original municipal name Montalban.

It is the northernmost town in the province and comes after [[San Mateo, Rizal]], and [[Quezon City]] coming from [[Metro Manila]]. The town is located on the slopes of the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] mountain range and it is the largest town in Rizal province with an area of {{convert|312.70|km2|abbr=off|sp=us}}. It is also the location of the Montalban Gorge that is associated with the Legend of ''[[Bernardo Carpio]]''. The gorge forms part of a protected area known as the [[Pamitinan Protected Landscape]].

The municipality borders [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]] and [[Antipolo]], Rizal on the south, [[Norzagaray]] and [[San Jose del Monte]], Bulacan on the north, [[Quezon City]] and [[Caloocan]] on the west and [[General Nakar]], [[Quezon]] on the east. It is one of the richest municipalities in the Philippines, ranking third in 2016 with an income of {{Philippine peso|691 million|link=yes}}.<ref name="COA Report 2016"/>

==Etymology==
The town's former official name of Montalban derives from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''monte'', which translates to "mountain," in reference to the numerous hills found within and surrounding the town.<ref name="history"/> A common name for the municipality up to the present, it was its official name from its founding in 1871 until 1982 when the [[Batasang Pambansa]] officially renamed it to Rodriguez under Batas Pambansa Blg. 275 in honor of [[Eulogio Rodriguez]], a native of the municipality who served as its first municipal president and [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|Philippine Senate president]].<ref name="rename"/>

==History==
[[File:Philippine Island - Luzon Island - NARA - 68156941.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Montalban, circa 1930s]]

Based on the 1954 journal ''History and Cultural Life of Montalban and its Barrios'', what would then be the town of Montalban was formerly the barrio ''Balite'' which was under the jurisdiction of the town of [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]] during the Spanish period. The town was then founded by Fr. Eustaquio of [[Pasig]] in 1871.<ref name="history"/> On another account, San Mateo, with its large size, was partitioned on April 27, 1871, when Captain General [[Rafael Izquierdo y Gutiérrez|Rafael Izquierdo]] issued a decree separating the barrios of Balite, Burgos, Marang and Calipahan from San Mateo and formed them into the new municipality of Montalban.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

According to the Executive Summary included in the Annual Audit Reports of Rodriguez, Rizal, the municipality of Montalban was founded on June 30, 1871, under the "Acta de Erreccion" or Deed of Foundation.<ref name="audit report 2012"/> The town, including its ''poblacion'', was initially part of the [[Manila (province)|province of Manila]], while its present-day mountainous central and eastern portion, according to old maps, was under the jurisdiction of the [[Morong (district)|District of Morong]].<ref>{{cite map |author =P.

San Mateo served as the seat of government in line with the economic centralization.<ref name="act 942"/> Montalban then separated from San Mateo to become an independent municipality again by virtue of Executive Order No. 20 on February 29, 1908.

In 1982, the town was officially renamed to Rodriguez under Batas Pambansa Blg. 275 in honor of the former [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate president]] and town native [[Eulogio A. Rodriguez Sr.|Eulogio Rodriguez, Sr.]]<ref name="rename"/>

On October 30, 1997, rebels from the [[New People's Army]] (NPA), the militant arm of the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]], raided the police station of Rodriguez before noontime, where they ransacked the armory, killed one police officer, and kidnapped Rene Francisco, the police chief. He was later released on December 5, 1997 in [[Tanay, Rizal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Captured Police Chief Rene Francisco kisses his wife Teresita as he holds his son Remsie[...]|url=https://www.alamy.com/captured-police-chief-rene-francisco-kisses-his-wife-teresita-as-he-holds-his-son-remsie-after-he-was-released-friday-dec-5-1997-in-tanay-25-miles-east-of-manila-francisco-together-wiht-army-msergeant-joaquin-melad-who-were-held-captive-for-36-days-were-abducted-by-the-communist-new-peoples-army-rebels-during-a-raid-at-the-rodriguez-police-detachment-in-rizal-province-east-of-manila-p-photopat-roque-image543042485.html|website=[[Alamy]]|publisher=Alamy Ltd.|access-date=July 8, 2023}}</ref>

===Proposed cityhood===
As early as 2018, the town's Sangguniang Bayan approved Resolution No. 60, Series of 2018 requesting the Senate of the Philippines thru its [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|president]], [[Tito Sotto|Vicente Sotto III]] and the House of Representatives through its [[Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines|speaker]], [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] to co-sponsor a bill for Rodriguez's conversion into a city.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

===Proposed reversion of town name to Montalban===
[[File:Municipality of Rodriguez (Montalban) Executive Order DLH-041 S-2020, Header detail.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Official document from 2020 bearing the town name "Montalban" instead of the official name "Rodriguez".]]
In mid-to-late 2019, before a formal ruling could be enacted, the municipal government under the term of Mayor [[Dennis Hernandez]] started to refer to the town as Montalban. 

Notable examples were the discontinuation of the use of the town name Rodriguez in official documents, office names and correspondences, and the municipal government utilizing a modified municipal seal that indicates the name "Montalban" instead of "Rodriguez". In February 2020, a new municipal seal that bears the year 1871 as the date of establishment was used. 

In April 2020, the municipality celebrated its 149th Foundation Day (''Araw ng Montalban''); in the previous year April 2019, at the time when 1909 was still the recognized date of establishment, the municipality celebrated its 110th founding anniversary.<ref name="montalban usage 2019"/>

In response to the numerous requests from the town's native residents to return the town to its former name, on July 3, 2019 during the [[18th Congress of the Philippines|18th Congress]], [[Rizal's 2nd congressional district|Rizal's 2nd District]] Representative Juan Fidel Nograles filed ''House Bill No. 337''.<ref name="return montalban"/><ref name="hb337 18th congress"/> The bill was later substituted by ''HB No. 8899'' filed March 5, 2021;<ref name="hb8899 18th congress"/> it was approved by the House of Representatives on March 17 and was received by the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] on March 27. It was introduced by Sen. [[Imee Marcos]] under ''Senate Bill No. 2258'' on June 1.<ref name="sb2258 18th congress"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://legacy.senate.gov.ph/18th_congress/ctte_notices/local_121421.pdf |title=Notice from the Senate|date=Dec 14, 2021 |access-date=Aug 3, 2022 }}</ref>

In the Senate hearing of the Committee on Local Government on January 21, 2022, the [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]] did not pose any objection on the proposed measure and clarified that the proposed change will only apply to the municipality's name; structures and other features such as buildings, schools in the municipality dedicated in memory of Rodriguez are not covered by the proposed bill and should be retained.<ref>Committee Hearing on Local Government, January 21, 2022 stream through Facebook</ref>

With further minor amendments, the bill was approved on third and final reading on January 31. The [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House]] adopted the Senate amendment and the bill was submitted to the [[President of the Philippines|president]] for his signature.

On June 2, 2022, Republic Act No. 11812, an act for the reversion of the name of municipality Rodriguez to Montalban and repealing Batas Pambansa Blg. 275, lapsed into law. A plebiscite, having no final schedule yet, will be supervised by the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]].<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=RA|number=11812|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2022/06/02/republic-act-no-11812/ |title=An Act Renaming the Municipality of Rodriguez in the Province of Rizal as the Municipality of Montalban, Repealing for the Purpose Batas Pambansa Blg. 275 |date=June 2, 2022 |website=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines]] |access-date=June 29, 2022 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1177758 |title=Bill dividing QC barangay into 3 lapses into law |date=June 28, 2022 |first=Azer|last=Parrocha|work=[[Philippine News Agency]] |access-date=June 28, 2022 }}</ref>

==Geography==
Rodriguez is a town of mountains. From its north to south, a series of sloping ridges, hills and mountains ranges adorn the town. In fact, around 27% of the town is occupied by mountains and slopes. The town's highest peak is Mount Irid, {{convert|1,469|m|sp=us}} above sea level.

Rodriguez makes up {{Percentage|312.7|1,191.94|2}} of the {{convert|1,191.94|km2|sp=us|adj=on}} total area of Rizal, housing 11 barangays. Rodriguez's economic activities include agriculture and commerce such as the Avilon Zoo.

===Elevation and slope===
[[File:Rodriguez,Rizaljf5917 09.JPG|thumbnail|left|The mountainous interior of Rodriguez|250x250px]]
[[File:Coralline limestone outcrop along Puray-Mascap road, Rodriguez, Rizal Province, Philippines 02.jpg|thumbnail|left|Coralline limestone along the Mascap-Puray Road|250x250px]]
Rodriguez is generally very rough in topography, with 83% of its total land area composed of upland areas, hills and mountain ranges. The remaining 17% low-lying terrain and rolling lands are found at the south-western portion of the municipality, along with the northern portions of the Municipality of [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]].

The rolling slopes comprise the Marikina River Valley, where water from higher elevations drain towards the [[Marikina River]] and its tributaries at the south-western portion of the municipality. Elevations at these western lowlands range from {{convert|10|to|30|m|sp=us}} above sea level. The western portion of the flatlands gently rises towards the west, which is part of [[Quezon City]].

The mountainous regions of Rodriguez are found at the central and eastern areas, with sleepy sloping ridges and mountain ranges, traversing north to south. The terrain in these mountain ranges has slopes ranging from 30 to 50%. Very steep hills and mountains have slopes greater than 50%. Rolling to hilly areas 18–30% in slope can also be found. These high elevations are drained by the Tanay, Puray, and Rodriguez Rivers.

[[File:Montalban patok jeepney.png|thumb|A patok jeepney plying the route of Montalban - Cubao. They are known for booming music, bright lights and colorful and artistic designs.]]
The main transportation used in the municipality are jeepneys, tricycles, [[UV Express]], and buses. There are jeepneys that ply through the towns of San Mateo, Marikina and Cubao  in Quezon City via [[Marikina–Infanta Highway|Marcos Highway]], while some ply the route that leads to [[Philippine Coconut Authority|Philcoa]] in Quezon City via [[Batasan Road]] in San Mateo, others connect Rodriguez to Litex Road in Quezon City. UV Express vehicles ply the routes to Cubao in Quezon City and Santa Lucia Grand Mall in [[Cainta, Rizal|Cainta]]. During the 2010s, there were additional UV Express vehicles that serve the routes to [[SM North EDSA|North EDSA]] in Quezon City and [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo]] in Manila, and the route to Cubao operates via Marikina and via Payatas Road.

Formerly, there was railway service under the [[Philippine National Railways|Manila Railroad Company]] that traversed the [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]], [[Marikina]], and [[Pasig]] areas and had its terminus at Barangay Balitè behind the Santo Rosario Parish Church. It had been long dismantled and the railway line converted into roadway that now consists of the road aptly named ''Daang Bakal''.

It is known that 'patok' jeepneys originated from this town way back during the 1980s. These jeepneys are known for their notoriety on the road. Despite this, they are popular among the passengers hence the name ''patók'' which means 'popular'. They still ply this town up to this day, most plying the Montalban-Cubao route via Marcos Highway. These jeepneys have already spread throughout the Rizal province as well as in Marikina since then.

The Marikina Auto Line Transport Corporation (MALTC) buses is the only one that regularly travels to farther places like [[Makati]] and [[Parañaque]]. However, during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the [[Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board]] (LTFRB) implemented a route rationalization system for [[List of bus routes in Metro Manila|city buses]]. Currently, a city bus route connects Montalban with the capital city of [[Manila]] and [[Parañaque Integrated Terminal Exchange]].

The proposed San Mateo Railway will connect the municipality of Rodriguez to the [[LRT Line 2|Light Rail Transit Line 2]], in which 6 stations are in development.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Piad |first1=Tyrone Jasper C. |title=Government lines up several railway projects nationwide |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1807324/govt-lines-up-several-railway-projects-nationwide |work=INQUIRER.net |date=26 July 2023 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=San Mateo Railway Project {{!}} PPP Center |url=https://ppp.gov.ph/ppp_projects/san-mateo-railway/ |website=ppp.gov.ph |language=en}}</ref>
