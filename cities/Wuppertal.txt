'''Wuppertal''' ({{IPA|de|ˈvʊpɐtaːl|-|Wuppertal.ogg}}; {{lit.}} "''[[Wupper]] [[dale (landform)|Dale]]''") is a city in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]], with a population of 355,000. Wuppertal is the seventh-largest city in North Rhine-Westphalia and [[List of cities in Germany by population|17th-largest]] in Germany.  It was founded in 1929 by the merger of [[Elberfeld]], [[Barmen]], [[Ronsdorf]], [[Cronenberg, Wuppertal|Cronenberg]] and [[Vohwinkel Schwebebahn|Vohwinkel]], and was initially "Barmen-Elberfeld" before adopting its present name in 1930.  It is the capital and largest city of the [[Bergisches Land]].

The city straddles the densely populated banks of the River [[Wupper]], a tributary of the [[Rhine]]. Wuppertal is located between the [[Ruhr]] ([[Essen]]) to the north, [[Düsseldorf]] to the west, and [[Cologne]] to the southwest, and over time has grown together with [[Solingen]], [[Remscheid]] and [[Hagen]]. The stretching of the city in a long band along the narrow Wupper Valley leads to a spatial impression of Wuppertal being larger than it actually is. The city is known for its steep slopes, its woods and parks, and for being the greenest city in Germany, with two-thirds green space of the total municipal area. From any part of the city, it is only a ten-minute walk to one of the public parks or woodland paths.

The Wupper Valley was, along with the [[Ore Mountains]] and before the [[Ruhr]], the first highly industrialized region of Germany, which resulted in the construction of the [[Wuppertal Schwebebahn]] [[suspension railway]] in the then independent cities of [[Elberfeld]] and [[Barmen]]. The increasing demand for coal from the textile mills and blacksmith shops from those cities encouraged the expansion of the nearby [[Ruhr]]. Wuppertal still is a major industrial centre, being home to industries such as textiles, [[metallurgy]], chemicals, pharmaceuticals, electronics, automobiles, rubber, vehicles and printing equipment. [[Aspirin]] originates from Wuppertal, patented in 1897 by [[Bayer]], as does the [[Vorwerk (company)|Vorwerk]] Kobold [[vacuum cleaner]].<ref name="110 Jahre Aspirin">{{cite web|url=http://geschichtspuls.de/art1294-markenjubilaum-110-jahre-aspirin-kopfschmerzmittel|title=110 Jahre Aspirin|access-date=May 22, 2011|publisher=GeschichtsPuls|author=Marvin Brendel|language=de}}</ref><ref name="Kobold vacuum cleaner">{{cite web|url=http://corporate.vorwerk.com/en/divisions/kobold-vacuum-cleaners/|title=Official website Vorwerk – Kobold vacuum cleaners|access-date=May 22, 2011|archive-date=February 21, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221032048/http://corporate.vorwerk.com/en/divisions/kobold-vacuum-cleaners/|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[Wuppertal Institute|Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy]] and the European Institute for International Economic Relations are located in the city.<ref name="EIIW">{{cite web|url=http://eiiw.eu/index.php?id=3619&L=1|title=Official website European Institute for International Economic Relations|access-date=March 2, 2013}}</ref> [[Barmen]] was the birthplace of [[Friedrich Engels]].

==History==
[[File:Einwohnerentwicklung von Wuppertal - ab 1871.svg|thumb|Population development]]
Wuppertal in its present borders was formed in 1929 by merging the industrial cities of [[Barmen]] and [[Elberfeld]] along with the communities of [[Vohwinkel, Wuppertal|Vohwinkel]], [[Ronsdorf]], [[Cronenberg, Wuppertal|Cronenberg]], [[Langerfeld]] and [[Beyenburg]]. The initial name '''Barmen-Elberfeld''' was changed in a 1930 referendum to Wuppertal ("Wupper Valley"). The new city was administered as part of [[Prussia]]'s [[Rhine Province]].

Uniquely for Germany, it is a "[[Linear settlement|linear city]]", owing to the steep hillsides along the river [[Wupper]]. Its highest hill is the [[Lichtscheid]], which is {{convert|351|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The dominant urban centres Elberfeld (historic commercial centre) and Barmen (more industrial) have formed a continuous urbanized area since 1850. During the succeeding decades, "Wupper-Town" became the dominant industrial agglomeration of northwestern Germany. During the 20th century, this conurbation had been surpassed by [[Cologne]], Düsseldorf and the [[Ruhr area]], all with a more favourable topography.

From 5 July 1933 to 19 January 1934 the [[Kemna concentration camp]] was established in Wuppertal. It was one of the early [[Nazi concentration camps]], created by the [[Nazi Party]] to [[incarcerate]] their political opponents upon [[Machtergreifung|gaining power in 1933]]. The camp was established in a former factory on the Wupper in the Kemna neighborhood of the Barmen part of Wuppertal.

During [[World War II]], about 40% of buildings in the city were destroyed by Allied bombing, as were many other German cities and industrial centres (see [[Bombing of Wuppertal in World War II]]). However, a large number of historic sites have been preserved, such as:

* Ölberg, literally "Oil mountain", Germany's largest original working class district, is protected as a [[historic monument]]. The name came about during the 1920s as the district continued using oil lamps while the surrounding bourgeois residential quarters were electrified. In traditional use, the name "Ölberg" refers to the [[Mount of Olives]] in [[Jerusalem]].
* [[Wuppertal-Brill|Brill]] is one of Germany's largest districts of [[Gründerzeit]] villas, i.e. middle class mansions built by industrial entrepreneurs during the second half of the 19th century.

The US [[78th Infantry Division (United States)|78th Infantry Division]] under Major General [[Edwin P. Parker Jr.]] captured Wuppertal against scant resistance on 16 April 1945.<ref>Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939–1946'', Stackpole Books (Revised Edition 2006), p. 147</ref> Wuppertal became a part of the [[British Zone of Occupation]], and subsequently part of the new state of North Rhine-Westphalia in [[West Germany]].

Wuppertal currently has a population of about 355,000. The number of inhabitants more than doubled in 1929 as a result of the [[Barmen]]–[[Elberfeld]] merger. The economic boom of the 1950s and 60s saw the establishment of new industry headquarters and with it an influx of workers, including migrant workers from [[Turkey]], [[Greece]] and [[Italy]]. Population numbers during these times of as-yet unparalleled growth peaked at about 423,000 in 1963; in the 1970s, a period of steady decline followed in the wake of industrial losses.

As of 31 December 2022, the largest groups of foreign residents were:

In total, Wuppertal possesses over 4,500 buildings classified as national monuments, most exemplifying styles such as [[Neoclassicism]], [[Eclecticism]], [[Historicism]], [[Art Nouveau]]/[[Jugendstil]] and [[Bauhaus]]. The American TV station [[CNN]] recommended Wuppertal as one of 20 places worldwide to visit in the year 2020 because of the Schwebebahn, the architectural diversity and the Nordbahntrasse, a {{convert|22|km|adj=on}} cycle route across the city 2020.<ref>CNN: 20 places to visit in 2020 [https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/places-to-visit-2020/index.html])</ref>

==Sports==

===Association football===
In [[Association football|football]], Wuppertal's most popular club is [[Wuppertaler SV]] which currently play in the [[Regionalliga West]], the fourth tier of the [[German football league system]]. Playing their home games at the city's [[Stadion am Zoo]], the club, which enjoyed its last season in a nationwide division during the [[2009–10 3. Liga|2009–10 season]], looks back on a rich and eventful history since its establishment as the result of a 1954 merger between the two main Wuppertal clubs ''SSV 04 Wuppertal'' and ''TSG Vohwinkel 80''. The club spent a total of seven seasons in the top flight of German football, three of which in the [[Bundesliga]], which they were promoted to during 1972. In their first season in the nationwide first division, the club reached a remarkable fourth place and qualified for the [[1973–74 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] for the first and only time in its history. After a first-round defeat by Polish side [[Ruch Chorzów]] and another two widely unsuccessful Bundesliga campaigns, the club disappeared from the top flight again, though, and has yet to return.

During 2004, the club merged with local rivals ''SV Borussia Wuppertal'' to form ''Wuppertaler SV Borussia'', though the name change remained the only visible attribute of the merger with the club's colours and crest remaining unaltered. The additional "Borussia" was scrapped again during 2013 due to fans' demand amidst a change of leadership which was brought about to lead the club through necessary insolvency proceedings which have been completed as of September 2014.

Another noteworthy Wuppertal football club is '''Cronenberger SC''' from the district of [[Cronenberg, Wuppertal|Cronenberg]]. Their greatest success to date is reaching the 1952 [[German amateur football championship]] final which they lost 5–2 against [[BSV 07 Schwenningen|VfR Schwenningen]]. Today, they play one tier below WSV in the [[Oberliga Nordrhein]].

Famous players include [[Günter Pröpper]] who scored 39 of WSV's 136 Bundesliga goals and [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] international [[Horst Szymaniak]], as well as Cronenberg's [[Herbert Jäger]] who represented [[Germany Olympic football team|Germany]] at the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in Helsinki during his stay with the club.

===Team handball===
In [[team handball|handball]], Wuppertal's most successful team is [[Bergischer HC]], playing in the top-tier [[Handball-Bundesliga]] which they were promoted to for the second time during 2013, reaching 15th place during the [[2013–14 Handball-Bundesliga|2013–14 campaign]] and therefore staying among the top scorers for a second consecutive season. ''BHC'' originates from a 2006 cooperation between the management, squad and main sponsor of LTV Wuppertal and rivals SG Solingen from the nearby [[Solingen|city of the same name]]. The club advertises itself as a representative of the entire [[Bergisches Land]] region. The team plays its home games at both Wuppertal's ''[[Uni-Halle]]'' (3,200 seats) and Solingen's ''Klingenhalle'' (2,600 seats).

Wuppertal's past most successful club are the aforementioned '''LTV Wuppertal'''. LTV spent most of their seasons in the second and third tiers, before they merged with ''Wuppertaler SV's'' handball section in 1996 to form ''HSG LTV/WSV Wuppertal''. The handball combination was promoted to the Bundesliga after its inaugural season, finishing 8th before dissolving again in 1998. However, the mere departure of Wuppertaler SV still allowed LTV Wuppertal, whose professional team were renamed ''HC Wuppertal'', to play another three seasons in the Bundesliga before returning to the 2nd division and re-introducing its old name. After the establishment of BHC in 2006, LTV lost its financial base and was relegated several times, currently playing in the fifth-tier Verbandsliga.

===Volleyball===
In [[volleyball]], [[SV Bayer Wuppertal]] was one of Germany's leading men's teams for many years during the 1990s and 2000s. The team was part of the well-known mass-sports club originating in [[Leverkusen]] and was promoted to the Bundesliga in 1978. Reacting to low attendances, the eponymous [[Bayer|Bayer AG]] decided to relocate the volleyball team to Wuppertal in 1992, where there also was a Bayer-funded club. After the move, the club won various titles, including the German championship in 1994 and 1997 and the German Cup in 1995. In addition to that, they finished runners-up to Greek side [[Olympiacos S.C.]] in the 1995–96 [[CEV Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]], losing the final in five sets.

After the wide-reaching retreat of Bayer AG from less popular professional sport during 2008, the club acquired the name ''Wuppertal Titans'' and later ''A!B!C Titans Berg. Land''. However, the loss of their main sponsor eventually resulted in the team having to terminate during 2012. Presently, they once more play by the name of Bayer Wuppertal in the third-tier Regionalliga, unable to promote with their current financial set-up.

===Basketball===
Perhaps one of the most successful Wuppertal sports clubs was the '''[[women's basketball]]''' team of '''[[Wuppertal Wings|Barmer TV]]''' (known as ''BTV Wuppertal'' between 1994 and 2000, ''BTV Gold-Zack Wuppertal'' between 2000 and 2002 and ''Wuppertal Wings'' internationally). An 11-time [[List of German basketball champions#German champions (women)|German champion]] and 12-time German Cup winner, they won a remarkable ten consecutive doubles between 1993 and 2002. During [[1995–96 FIBA Women's European Champions Cup|1996]], they even won the [[EuroLeague Women|European Cup]] as the first and so far only German side, beating [[Italy]]'s [[SFT Como]] in the final. A year later, they narrowly missed out on back-to-back trebles, losing to French side [[CJM Bourges]] in the [[1997 EuroLeague Women|newly christened EuroLeague's]] final.

In 2002, the club withdrew from the Bundesliga due to financial troubles, their then-main sponsor ''Gold-Zack Werke'' filing for insolvency a year later. After a decade-long stay in amateur divisions, Barmer TV returned to the second-tier 2nd Bundesliga North in 2014.

Wuppertal co-hosted the [[1998 FIBA World Championship for Women]] as one of seven host cities.

===Roller hockey===
In [[Roller hockey (Quad)|roller hockey]], Wuppertal club RSC Cronenberg are one of the most successful German teams, having won the [[Rink Hockey Bundesliga|German championship]] and the German Cup in both men's and women's competitions. In total, the men won 13 German championships and nine cups, the women ten championships and nine cups. Both teams play their home games at ''Alfred-Henckels-Halle''.

Wuppertal hosted several international tournaments, including the World Championship in 1997 ([[FIRS Roller Hockey World Cup|men]]) and [[2004 Ladies Rink Hockey World Championship|2004]] ([[FIRS Women's Roller Hockey World Cup|women]]) and the European Championship in [[1992 Rink Hockey European Championship|1992]], [[2010 Rink Hockey European Championship|2010]] ([[CERH European Roller Hockey Championship|men]]) and 2011 ([[CERH European Women's Roller Hockey Championship|women]]).

==Transport==

===Railways===
[[File:Wuppertal Döppersberg 2018 129.jpg|thumb|Central Station]]
Wuppertal is well connected to the rail network. The town lies on the Cologne–Hagen and the Düsseldorf–Hagen railway lines, and is a stop for long-distance traffic. The [[Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof|central station]] is located in the district of Elberfeld. [[Regionalbahn]] trains and some [[Regional-Express]] trains also stop at [[Wuppertal-Oberbarmen station|Oberbarmen]], [[Wuppertal-Barmen station|Barmen]], [[Wuppertal-Ronsdorf station|Ronsdorf]] and [[Wuppertal-Vohwinkel station|Vohwinkel]]. There are also S-Bahn stations in [[Wuppertal-Langerfeld station|Langerfeld]], [[Wuppertal-Unterbarmen station|Unterbarmen]], [[Wuppertal-Steinbeck station|Steinbeck]], [[Wuppertal-Zoologischer Garten station|Zoologischer Garten]] and [[Wuppertal-Sonnborn station|Sonnborn]].

The rail services that operate on the [[Elberfeld–Dortmund railway|mainline through the valley]] are the RE 4 ([[Wupper-Express]]), RE 7 ([[Rhein-Münsterland-Express]]), RE 13 ([[Maas-Wupper-Express]]), RB 48 ([[Rhein-Wupper Bahn]]) and four [[Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn]] services: the [[S7 (Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn)|S 7]], [[S8 (Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn)|S 8]], [[S9 (Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn)|S 9]] and [[S68 (Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn)|S 68]] (peak hours only). Every 30 minutes, it is served by a long-distance ([[Intercity-Express]], [[Intercity (Deutsche Bahn)|InterCity]], [[EuroCity in Germany|EuroCity]]) service in each direction.

With the exception of the [[Wuppertal-Oberbarmen–Solingen railway|line from Wuppertal to Solingen]] (operated as the S 7) and the [[Wuppertal-Vohwinkel–Essen-Überruhr railway|Prince William Railway]] to Essen (now S-Bahn line S 9), all of the branch lines connecting to main line in the city of Wuppertal are now closed. This includes, among others, the [[Düsseldorf-Derendorf–Dortmund Süd railway]] (the ''Wuppertaler Nordbahn''), the [[Burgholz Railway]], the [[Wuppertal-Wichlinghausen–Hattingen railway]], the [[Wupper Valley Railway]] and [[Solingen–Wuppertal-Vohwinkel railway|the Corkscrew Railway]]. Thus, there were once 31 stations in the Wuppertal area, including nine stations on the mainline. Nowadays only ten are serviced any more.

Wuppertal Hauptbahnhof is the location of the [[lost luggage]] services for [[Deutsche Bahn]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/23/travel/germany-lost-luggage-auction.html|title=The Secret Afterlife of Lost German Luggage|last=Emory|first=Sami|date=December 25, 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=December 26, 2019|last2=Meichsner|first2=Andreas|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

The [[Wuppertal Suspension Railway]], a [[Suspension railway|suspended]] [[monorail]], serves the city and its surroundings. It has operated since 1901, with new cars added beginning in December 2016. In 1950, a young elephant named [[Tuffi]] was put aboard the Wuppertal Schwebebahn (monorail), as a promotion for the Althoff Circus. The swinging tram upset the elephant, and she trumpeted, charged, and plummeted {{convert|40|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on|0}} into the river below. Tuffi suffered minor injuries; she lived until 1989. In 1999, the ''Schwebebahn'' had its thus far [[1999 Wuppertal Suspension Railway accident|only fatal accident]].

Between 1873 and 1987, Wuppertal was served by its own [[trams in Wuppertal|tram network]].
