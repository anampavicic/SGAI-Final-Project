'''Biñan''' ({{IPA-all|biˈɲan}}), officially the '''City of Biñan''' ({{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Biñan}}), is a 1st class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 407,437 people.{{PH census|current}}

Biñan has become both a suburban residential community of [[Metro Manila]] and a location for some of the Philippines' largest [[industrial estates]] and [[export processing zones]]. Prior to its cityhood in 2010, Biñan was the richest [[Municipalities of the Philippines|municipality]] in the Philippines with an annual gross income of {{Philippine peso|677 million|link=yes}} ({{US$|14.383 million|link=yes}}) and net income of ₱250 million (US$5.308 million), as of 2007 by the [[Commission on Audit (Philippines)|Commission on Audit]].<ref>{{cite web|title=2007 Financial Statements Highlights for Local Government Units |url=http://www.coa.gov.ph/Reports/RFP/2007FS_Highlights-LGUs.pdf |publisher=Commission On Audit Philippines |access-date=August 26, 2012 |archive-date=September 20, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920082041/http://www.coa.gov.ph/Reports/RFP/2007FS_Highlights-LGUs.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 407,437, making it the third largest in population in the province of Laguna, after [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]] and [[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Santa Rosa]].{{PH census|current}}

By virtue of Republic Act No. 10658, signed on March 27, 2015, by [[Benigno Aquino III|President Benigno Aquino III]], Biñan has been separated from the [[Laguna's 1st congressional district|first congressional district of Laguna]] and formed the [[Legislative district of Biñan|lone congressional district of Biñan]].

==Etymology==
Where Biñan got its name is a mystery. Some deduced that before [[Juan de Salcedo|Captain Juan de Salcedo]] proceeded to [[Cainta]] and [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]] finally reaching [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]], he landed in Biñan. According to the story, Padres Alfonso de Alvarado and Diego Espinar planted a huge wooden cross on the spot where the present-day San Isidro Labrador parish stands and co-celebrated a [[Thanksgiving|Thanksgiving Mass]]. Curious natives gathered and the two Spanish missionaries took advantage of the situation. They baptized each one of them. From then on, old folks say they called the place “Binyagan,” which means a baptismal place in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]. The place's root word ''[[wikt:binyag|binyag]]'' is originally a [[Brunei Malay]] word which means “to pour water from above,” according to the dictionary ''[[Vocabulario de la lengua tagala]]''. The Spanish tongue's difficulty in pronouncing the local dialect acquired for the once town its name — "Biñan".

An 1846 book in [[French language|French]] also spelled the town as Viñan.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mallat De Bassilan |first1= Jean-Baptiste |date=1846 |title=Les Philippines: histoire, géographie, moeurs |trans-title= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D6sUAAAAQAAJ&dq=%22pueblo+de+Vi%C3%B1an%22&pg=PA130 |accessdate=March 13, 2024 |language=fr |location=Paris |publisher=A. Bertrand |isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date= |via= |quote=}}</ref> It is also spelled in other references as Biniang, Binyang, Binang, or Biñang.

==History==
[[File:Alberto Mansion Biñan City, Laguna.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alberto Mansion]]]]
[[File:Rizal in Biñan 1948 PHC historical marker.jpg|thumb|left|Rizal in Biñan historical marker]]
Captain [[Juan de Salcedo]] explored [[Laguna de Bay]] and founded Biñan at the end of June 1571, a month after [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] established [[Manila]]. In 1644, [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars turned the area into a hacienda known as Hacienda de San Isidro Labrador de Biñán, in honor of Saint [[Isidore the Laborer]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Santiago |first1= Luciano P.R. |title=The Roots of Pila, Laguna: A Secular and Spiritual History of the Town (900 Ad to the Present) |trans-title= |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/29792218 |journal=Philippine Quarterly of Culture and Society|volume=25|number=3/4|date=1997|pages= 125–155 |accessdate=March 13, 2024 |publisher=University of San Carlos Publications |jstor= 29792218 }}</ref><ref name="pueblo" /> When the seat of the provincial government of the ''Provincia de la Laguna de Bay'' was transferred from [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]] to [[Pagsanjan]] in 1688, Biñan separated from Tabuco (now the city of [[Cabuyao]]). In the 1600s Biñan had 256 Chinese-Filipino and 1,639 Native Filipino tributes. <ref name="ConquestandPestilence">Conquest and Pestilence in the Early Spanish Philippines By Linda A.

In 1747, the Spaniards officially converted Biñan into a ''[[pueblo]]'' (town).<ref name="pueblo">{{cite news|url=https://www.manilastandard.net/?p=314204584|title=The evolution of Biñan from pueblo to city|date=February 4, 2022|first=Pepe|last=Alas|publisher=Manila Standard|accessdate=March 13, 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://manilastandard.net/?p=314204548|title=Araw ng Biñan '22 celebrates history, culture, progress|date=February 4, 2022|first= Peter Paul|last=Duran|publisher=Manila Standard|accessdate=March 13, 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://opinyon.net/laguna/araw-ng-binan-2023-promoting-values-regeneration|title=Araw ng Biñan 2023: PROMOTING 'VALUES REGENERATION'|first1=James|last1=Veloso|first2=Catherine|last2=Go|date=January 30, 2023|accessdate=March 13, 2024|publisher=OpinYon News}}</ref> [[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Santa Rosa]] separated from Biñan in 1791 and was later established as an independent town on January 18, 1792.<ref name="santarosa">{{cite web|url=https://santarosacity.gov.ph/about-us|title=Historical Timeline|accessdate=March 13, 2024|website=Santa Rosa}}</ref>

Historically, Biñan has gained recognition nationwide for being part of the life of [[José Rizal]], one of the [[National hero of the Philippines|country's national hero]]. In June 1869, when Rizal was a child, he traveled to Biñan with his brother [[Paciano Rizal|Paciano]]. They moved into his aunt's home, which would serve as their lodging, near the town proper. Here, he received his [[School of Dr. Jose P. Rizal Site and Museum|first formal education]] through the tutelage of Maestro Justiniano Aquino Cruz and, after a year and a half of instruction, recommended the young Rizal to pursue higher education in Manila. The home where José Rizal resided was given a plaque of appreciation in his honor. Biñan's town square now has a monument in the center honoring Biñan's connection to Rizal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.binan.gov.ph/history|title=History|website=Biñan City Official Website|accessdate=March 13, 2024}}</ref>

In 1903, the adjacent towns of [[Muntinlupa]], then part of [[Rizal (province)|Rizal province]], and [[San Pedro, Laguna|San Pedro Tunasan]] were consolidated with Biñan.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=939|title=An Act reducing the thirty municipalities of the Province of La Laguna to nineteen|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l4037|date=October 12, 1903|accessdate=June 15, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite PH act|url=https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getdoc&DocId=622&Index=%2A9b8c493322d6ea4e01a8b64cca8b398a|title=An Act Amending Act Numbered Nine hundred and thirty-nine, entitled "An Act reducing the thirty municipalities of the Province of La Laguna to nineteen," and Act Numbered Nine hundred and forty-two, entitled "An Act reducing the thirty - two municipalities of the Province of Rizal to fifteen," and providing that the boundary line between the Provinces of La Laguna and Rizal be changed so as to include in La Laguna the municipality of Muntinlupa now a part of Rizal.|chamber=Act|number=1008|date=November 25, 1903|accessdate=April 24, 2022}}{{Dead link|date=October 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Both towns were later separated when Muntinlupa was returned to Rizal as part of [[Taguig]] in 1905 and San Pedro Tunasan regained its independent municipality status effective 1907.<ref>{{cite PH act|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l43ec|chamber=Act|number=1308|date=March 22, 1905|accessdate=April 24, 2022|title=An Act providing for the return of the former municipality of Muntinlupa from the Province of La Laguna to the Province of Rizal, repealing paragraph (e) of section one and sections two and three of Act Numbered One thousand and eight, and changing the name of the municipality of Pateros, of the Province of Rizal, to Taguig.}}</ref><ref>{{cite PH act|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%201553|chamber=Act|number=1553|date=October 29, 1906|accessdate=June 16, 2023|title=An Act Increasing the Number of Municipalities in the Province Of La Laguna from Twenty to Twenty-one, by Separating From Biñan the Former Municipality of San Pedro Tunasan, Reconstituting the Latter as a Municipality, and Giving to Each the Territory Which It Comprised Prior to the Passage of Act Numbered Nine Hundred and Thirty-nine.}}</ref>

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
On February 2, 2010, by the virtue of the Republic Act No. 9740, Biñan became a component city after its voters accepted the ratification in the plebiscite. It became the 4th city in the province and 139th in the [[Philippines]].

==Geography==
Biñan is located {{convert|35|km|sp=us}} south of [[Manila]] and {{convert|52|km|sp=us}} from [[Santa Cruz, Laguna|Santa Cruz]]. It is bounded on the north by [[San Pedro, Laguna|San Pedro]], on the west by [[General Mariano Alvarez]], [[Carmona, Cavite|Carmona]], and [[Silang, Cavite|Silang]], on the south by [[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Santa Rosa]], while on the east lies [[Laguna de Bay]], the largest lake in the country.

The city covers a total land area of {{convert|43.50|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} that represents {{percentage|43.5|1,917.85|2|%=&nbsp;percent}} of the entire Laguna province. In 2020, Biñan had a total population of 407,437.{{PH census|current}} It is the third most populated in the province ({{percentage|407,437|3,382,193|1}} of the provincial population), next only to Calamba ({{percentage|539,671|3,382,193|1}}) and Santa Rosa City ({{percentage|414,812|3,382,193|1}}).

===Topography===
Biñan is generally plain with 85.33 percent of its total area having a slope of zero to 2.5 percent. This covers all the 24 barangays except for small portions of Barangay Biñan and San Francisco having a slope ranging from 2.6 to 25 percent, meaning it is gently sloping to strongly sloping. With more than three-fourths of its area generally level to nearly level, this makes Biñan suitable for agricultural and urban development.

===Soil properties===
Of the eleven-soil series that compose the land area of Laguna, Carmona and Gingua series covers about two types that can only be seen in Biñan. Carmona series covers about {{convert|2,577|ha}} or {{percentage|25.77|43.5|2|%=&nbsp;percent}} seen in Biñan's land area. Agricultural land in these areas is primarily devoted to rice and sugar production. Gingua series, on other hand, specifically the fine sandy type covers {{convert|315|ha}} which is one of the most productive soils in Laguna where a variety of crops especially vegetables are grown profitably. The other two basic soil series comprising Biñan are Guadalupe series covering {{convert|660|ha}} and Lipa series with {{convert|798|ha}}.

===Barangays===
[[File:City of Biñan Barangay Map Official.jpg|thumb|Map of Biñan showing the barangays]]

Biñan is politically subdivided into 24 barangays, all classified as urban. Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s and some have [[sitios]].

Barangay San Francisco occupies the largest area, which is about 16.83 percent of Biñan, while Barangay Casile has the smallest area with only {{convert|12|ha|sp=us}} or 0.27 percent.

===Climate===
The climate of Biñan is characterized by two pronounced seasons: dry from November to April and wet during the rest of the year. Maximum rainfall occurs from June to September with an annual average rainfall of {{convert|200|mm|abbr=on}}. Biñan is protected by mountains in the peripheral areas, and thus it is making the area cooler.

Biñan has been popularly recognized as a trading center area immediately south of Metro Manila. The city has the largest [[Palengke|public market]] in the province of Laguna and in the [[Calabarzon|Calabarzon Region]]. Retailers from nearby towns often plow the city proper to purchase goods and merchandise intended to be sold elsewhere. Biñan has also been a center of commerce in the region because of the numerous banking institutions across the city, plus the ever-growing number of commercial establishments and emerging shopping centers.

A common sight is the preparations and setting up of the wholesalers and the arrival of [[jeepney]]s and trucks carrying various items such as fruits, vegetables, dry goods, dairy products, meat, fish, etc. The market activity would be 24 hours with peak reaching the early hours (3:00–7:00&nbsp;am [[Philippine Standard Time|PHT]]) as [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] are known to work in the early hours of the day trying to prevent exposure to the heating sun.

The city is also known for a type of [[pancake]] made from rice flour, topped with cheese or butter, called Puto Biñan. There are also slices of savory salted egg on top to contrast the mildly sweet pancake base. The best-known makers of Puto in Biñan are located in barangay San Vicente, and the city is renowned as "The Home of the Famous Puto Biñan in Laguna".

==Government==
[[File:Biñan City Hall.jpg|thumb|Biñan City Hall at night]]
[[File:Sentrong Pangkultura ng Biñan, Laguna, February 2023.jpg|thumb|The old Biñan Municipal Hall is the previous seat of municipal government. It now houses the ''Sentrong Pangkultura ng Biñan''.]]
{{see also|Sangguniang Panglungsod}}

Biñan is classified as a component city. The mayor is the chief executive and is assisted by the vice mayor, who presides over a legislative council consisting of 14 members: 12 elected members at-large, the President of the Sangguniang Kabataan (Youth Council) Federation representing the youth sector, and the President of the Association of Barangay Chairmen (ABC) as barangay sectoral representative. The council is in charge of creating the city's policies in the form of Ordinances and Resolutions.

The incumbent mayor is Walfredo "Arman" Dimaguila Jr., who previously served as the city's vice mayor. Angelo Alonte is the incumbent vice mayor. It is represented in the Congress by [[Marlyn Alonte]], a former mayor of the city.

The new Biñan City Hall in Barangay Zapote currently serves as the seat of city government. It was constructed to reflect its status as a component city. It succeeded the former municipal hall that is located in Barangay Poblacion (old town proper) and is still standing and has been repurposed as the ''Sentrong Pangkultura ng Biñan'' ({{translation|Cultural Center of Binan|literal=yes}}). This initiative aims to preserve and promote the city's rich cultural and artistic heritage.

===City seal===
The then-mayor of Biñan, [[Marlyn Alonte]], envisioned the new seal of the city, as Biñan became a city of the province of Laguna. The seal symbolized the following:

[[File:Binan City Seal.png|160px|right]]

*The Rizal Monument is used to depict the heroism of the National Hero of the Philippines, [[José Rizal|Dr. José Rizal]], who had his first formal education at Biñan under the tutelage of Maestro Justiniano Aquino Cruz who after a year and a half of tutelage advised the young Rizal to continue his education in Manila.
*The large [[mortar and pestle]] signify subterranean and earth-related resources, thus emblematizing the agricultural activities of the city, the renowned “Puto Biñan” and the “family” represents solidarity and the result of human industry and initiative in the areas of manufacturing and intellectual production.
*The “2010” represents the year that [[Republic Act]] No. 9740 was signed into law creating the City of Biñan and ratified by majority vote of its people during the [[plebiscite]] held on February 2, 2010.
*The book signifies the city's continuous quest for knowledge and its commitment to providing quality [[free education]] to its constituents.
*The industries represent the budding industries located at the Laguna Technopark and the Laguna International Industrial Park.
*The Heroes Monument symbolizes the bravery, sacrifice and valor of Biñan's ancestors.
*The pair of slippers had been adapted from the old Municipal Seal which, together with the cap represent the small businesses which originated from Biñan and entrepreneurial skills of its people.
*The [[#Barangays|24 barangays]] that constitute the demographic profile of the Municipality of Biñan.
*Their golden color signifies their individual verdant and abundant indigenous resources readily available for conversion into productive and profitable uses.
*The elements enumerated above are encircled at the outer edge by a golden circle, wherein the words “City of Biñan” are written within.
*The two golden stars flanking the words “City of Biñan” represent Service and Integrity.

===The Lone District of Biñan===
