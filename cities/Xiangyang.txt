}}</ref> The [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]] runs through Xiangyang's centre and divides the city north–south. The city itself is an agglomeration of two once separate cities: [[Fancheng]] and Xiangyang (or [[Xiangcheng District, Xiangyang|Xiangcheng]]), and was known as Xiangfan before 2010. What remains of old Xiangyang is located south of the [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]] and contains one of the oldest still-intact city walls in China, while Fancheng is located to the north of the Han River. Both cities served prominent historical roles in both ancient and pre-modern Chinese history. Today, the city has been a target of government and private investment as the country seeks to urbanize and develop the interior provinces. Its built-up area made up of 3 urban districts had 2,319,640 inhabitants at the 2020 census while the whole municipality contained approximately 5,260,951 people.

==History==
[[File:The Town of Fancheng, on the Bank of the Han Jiang (Han River). Hubei Province, China, 1874 WDL2101.png|thumb|left|Han River near Fancheng, 1874]]

Xiangyang is located at a strategic site on the middle reaches of the [[Han River (Hubei)|Han River]], and has witnessed several significant battles in Chinese history. Xiangyang County was first established at the location of modern Xiangcheng in the early [[Western Han]] dynasty and the name had been used continuously for more than 2,000 years until the 20th century.

In the final years of the [[Eastern Han]] dynasty, Xiangyang became the capital of [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]] (ancient Jingzhou). The warlord [[Liu Biao]] governed his territory from here. Under Liu's rule, Xiangyang became a major destination of the northern elite fleeing warfare in the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]]. In the [[Battle of Xiangyang (191)|Battle of Xiangyang]] in 191 AD, [[Sun Jian]], a rival warlord and the father of [[Sun Quan]], founder of [[Eastern Wu]], was defeated and killed. The area passed to [[Liu Bei]] after Liu Biao's death. Two decades later, [[Battle of Fancheng]], one of the most important battles in late Han-[[Three Kingdoms]] period, was fought here, resulting in [[Liu Bei]]'s loss of Jingzhou.

During the early years of [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]], Xiangyang was on the frontier between Jin and Eastern Wu. [[Yang Hu]], the commander in Xiangyang, was remembered for his policy of "border peace". Cross-border commerce was allowed, and the pressure on the Jin army was greatly relieved. Eventually, Xiangyang accumulated sufficient supplies for 10 years, which played a key role in [[Conquest of Wu by Jin|Jin's conquest of Wu]].

[[File:Xiangyang Guangde Si 2013.08.23 11-27-14.jpg|thumb|left|Guangde Temple, Xiangyang]]
In [[Southern Song]] dynasty, after the [[Treaty of Shaoxing]], Xiangyang became a garrison city on the northern frontier of Song. During [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty]], Xiangyang together with Fancheng formed one of the greatest obstacles against the expansion of [[Mongol Empire]]. They were able to resist for six years before finally surrendering in the [[Siege of Xiangyang]].

In 1796, Xiangyang was one of the centers of the [[White Lotus Rebellion]] against the [[Qing dynasty]]. Here, rebel leader [[Wang Cong'er]] successfully organized a rebel army of 50,000 and joined the main rebel forces in [[Sichuan]]. The revolt lasted for nearly 10 years and marked a turning point in the history of Qing dynasty.

In 1950, Xiangyang and Fancheng were merged to form Xiangfan City. In later 20th century, it became a major transport hub as [[Handan Railway|Handan]], [[Jiaoliu Railway|Jiaoliu]], and [[Xiangyu Railway|Xiangyu]] railways intersect in Fancheng. The city's current boundaries were established in 1983 when Xiangyang Prefecture was incorporated into Xiangfan City. The city was renamed to Xiangyang in 2010.

==Geography and climate==
Xiangyang has a latitude range of 31° 14'−32° 37' N, or {{convert|154|km|0|abbr=on}}, and longitude range of 110° 45'−113° 43' E, or {{convert|220|km|0|abbr=on}}, and is located on the middle reaches of the [[Hanshui]], a major tributary of the [[Yangtze River]]. The urban area, however, has a latitude range of 31° 54'−32° 10' N, or {{convert|29|km|0|abbr=on}}, and longitude range of 112° 00'−112° 14' E, or {{convert|21|km|0|abbr=on}}. It borders [[Suizhou]] to the east, [[Jingmen]] and [[Yichang]] to the south, [[Shennongjia]] and [[Shiyan]] to the west, and [[Nanyang, Henan|Nanyang]] ([[Henan]]) to the north. Its administrative border has a total length of {{convert|1332.8|km|abbr=on}}.

Xiangyang has a [[monsoon]]-influenced, four season [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), with cold, damp (but comparatively dry), winters, and hot, humid summers.
