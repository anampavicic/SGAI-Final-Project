==History==
In 2010, the population of the village was just over 100. Subsequently, intensive high-rise residential construction started, and apartments were sold to individuals who had jobs in nearby Saint Petersburg. The infrastructure lagged considerably behind this development.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ivbg.ru/7917396-kudrovo-bolshe-ne-derevnya-v-lenoblasti-oficialno-poyavilsya-novyj-gorod.html|script-title=ru:Кудрово больше не деревня.
