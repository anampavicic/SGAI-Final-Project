The '''Dhofar Governorate''' ({{langx|ar|مُحَافَظَة ظُفَّار|translit=Muḥāfaẓat Ẓuffār}}) is the largest of the 11 [[Governorates of Oman|governorates]] in the [[Oman|Sultanate of Oman]] in terms of area. It lies in southern Oman, on the eastern border with [[Yemen]]'s [[Al Mahrah Governorate]] and the southern border with [[Saudi Arabia]]'s [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]]. It is a rather [[mountainous]] area that covers {{convert|99300|km2|abbr=on}} and had a population of 416,458 in the 2020 census.<ref name="govom"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muscatdaily.com/Archive/Oman/Oman-s-population-is-2-773-479-Census |author=Our Correspondent 9:34&nbsp;am |title=Oman's population is 2,773,479: Census |date=12 June 2011 |work=[[Muscat Daily]] |access-date=19 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121223032937/http://www.muscatdaily.com/Archive/Oman/Oman-s-population-is-2-773-479-Census |archive-date=23 December 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Salalah]] is the largest city and capital of the governorate. Historically, the region was a source of [[frankincense]]. The local dialect of Arabic is [[Dhofari Arabic]], which is distinct from that used in the rest of Oman and in Yemen.

===Archaeology===
[[File:Journal.pone.0028239.g011 Dhofar Mountains Oman.png|thumb|left|Archaeologists excavating a [[Middle Stone Age]] complex]]

At ''Aybut Al-Auwal'' ("First Aybut") in Wadi Aybut (west-central Nejd), a site was discovered in 2011 containing more than 100 surface scatters of stone tools belonging to a regionally specific lithic industry, the late Nubian Complex, known previously only from Northeast Africa. Two optically stimulated [[Luminescence dating|luminescence age]] estimates place the Arabian Nubian Complex at 106,000 years old. This provides evidence for a distinct Middle Stone Age technocomplex in southern Arabia around the earlier part of the Marine Isotope Stage 5.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Nubian Complex of Dhofar, Oman: An African Middle Stone Age Industry in Southern Arabia|first1=Richard G.|last1=Roberts|first2=Mike W.|last2=Morley|first3=Viktor|last3=Černý|first4=Jean Marie|last4=Geiling|first5=Ash|last5=Parton|first6=Christopher S.|last6=Galletti|first7=Yamandu H.|last7=Hilbert|first8=Anthony E.|last8=Marks|first9=Vitaly I.|last9=Usik|first10=Jeffrey I.|last10=Rose|date=30 November 2011|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=6|issue=11|pages=e28239|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0028239|pmid=22140561|pmc=3227647|bibcode = 2011PLoSO...628239R|doi-access=free}}</ref> Bronze Age sites of the Dhofar Survey include tomb complexes found at Hodor (al-Hudfir).<ref>''Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian Studies''  Volume 40 2010 p253 "The most outstanding Bronze Age sites of the Dhofar Survey are the tomb/ceremonial complexes found at Hodor (al-Hudfir).

===Ancient times===
Venetian merchant [[Marco Polo]] wrote of Dhofar in [[The Travels of Marco Polo]] (c. 1300), stating:
{{blockquote|
Dufar is a great and noble and fine city. The people are Saracens [Muslims] and have a Count for their chief who is subject to the Soldan [Sultan] of [[Aden]]. Much white incense is produced here, and I will tell you how it grows. The trees are like small fir trees; these are notched with a knife in several places, and from these notches the incense is exuded. Sometimes it flows from the tree without any notch; this is by reason of the great heat of the sun there. This Dhafar is supposed to be the Sephar of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], x. 30.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023925085.0x000065|author1=Sirhān-bīn Sa'īd-bin Sirhān|author2= Translated by Edward Charles Ross|title=Annals of 'Omān|publisher=Journal, Asiatic Society of Bengal|page=83|year=1874}}</ref>

[[File:Frankincense Trees in Dhofar 3.jpg|thumb|A tall [[Boswellia sacra|frankincense tree]] (''Boswellia sacra'') stands out among the scenery]]
Dhofar was a major exporter of frankincense in ancient times, with some of it being traded as far as China.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YJibpHfnw94C&q=According+to+Li+Xun,+frankincense+originally+came+from+Persia.92+Laufer+refers+to+the+Xiangpu+fftff+by+Hong+Chu+%5C%25Ws+(&pg=PA130 |access-date=26 December 2011|title=Aspects of the Maritime Silk Road: From the Persian Gulf to the East China Sea|year=2010|volume=10 of East Asian Economic and Socio-cultural Studies – East Asian Maritime History|author=Ralph Kauz|editor=Ralph Kauz|publisher=Otto [[Harrassowitz Verlag]]|page=130|isbn=978-3-447-06103-2}}</ref>

[[Al-Baleed Archaeological Park|Al-Baleed]] (also spelled ''Al Blaid''), an area near Salalah which contains numerous archeological finds, used to serve as the home of the Manjawi Civilization from the 12th to 16th centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://al-hakawati.net/en_civilizations/CivilizationDetails/18288/Dhofar|title=Dhofar|website=al-hakawati.net|access-date=10 February 2019}}</ref>

Prior to Omani rule, a portion of Dhofar was partially part of the sultanate of [[Kathiri]], and was later mostly controlled by the tribes of Al-Hakli (Qara), thus given the name "[[Dhofar Mountains|Qara Mountain Range]]". Al-Shahri were believed to be the original inhabitants of Dhofar.

===19th century===
A historical political précis on Dhofar produced by the British Government indicate that in 1876, a man named Sayyid Fadhl bin Alawi, who had arrived in Dhofar from [[Mecca]] in August 1875, had established himself as the de facto ruler of Dhofar. He claimed allegiance to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], however, it was unknown if he was acting under their directive. With the help of Dhofari tribes he carried out warfare against the Bedouins of the interior. He was expelled by local sheikhs in January 1879.<ref>{{cite web|author=East India Company, the Board of Control, the India Office, or other British Government Department|url=https://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100022698177.0x000022|title=Persian Gulf Gazetteer, Historical and Political Materials, Maskat Territory, 1872–1903|page=31|publisher=G C Press|location=Simla|year=1903}} ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is freely available for re-use under the [[Open Government License]].''</ref>

===20th century===
Dhofar is extensively detailed in the 1917 publication ''Gazetteer of Arabia'', produced by the Government in British India and mostly based on information gathered by [[John Gordon Lorimer (1870-1914)|J.G. Lorimer]]'s in his 1908 and 1915 handbook ''[[Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia]]''. In it, Dhofar's boundaries are given as between the Samhan hills (Jebel Samhan) and the sea, from Ra's Risut eastwards for 30 miles to [[Khor Rori]]. Colloquially, the term Dhofar was used to describe the villages of [[Al Haffah]] and [[Salalah]], which housed about two-thirds of Dhofar's population at that time; however, on an official capacity, the term was understood to refer to the entire region of Dhofar, much like in the modern sense. Dhofar's physical geography was noted as consisting mainly of barren plains, a mountain range and several valleys, the most important of which was Wadi Raikut.<ref name="535p1917">{{cite web|author=General Staff, India|url=https://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023909213.0x0000a7|title=Gazetteer of Arabia|location=Simla|publisher=East India Company, the Board of Control, the India Office, or other British Government Department|page=535|year=1917}}</ref>

Communication outside of Dhofar was made difficult on account of the rugged landscape and the fact that no large harbors existed on the coast, though [[Mirbat]] and Risut were said to offer good anchorage for smaller vessels. The mountain paths were, for all intents and purposes, inaccessible during the rainy season. Aside from camels, no other transport animals were widely used. Frankincense was said to comprise the bulk of economic trade, with 9,000 cwt. being sent to [[Mumbai]] annually. Other exports were hides, sheep-skins, gums and beeswax. Among the chief imports were [[khat]] (which was mistaken for tobacco) from [[Mukalla]] and rice, sugar, dates and cloths from Mumbai.<ref name="535p1917"/>

Gordon Noel Jackson's 1943 essay on Dhofar provides a historical glimpse into the administration of the region:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023511755.0x00000e|title=A note on the Dhufar Province, Southern Arabia|author=Gordon Noel Jackson|location=Kuwait|page=6|website=qdl.qa|publisher=East India Company, the Board of Control, the India Office, or other British Government Department|date=23 June 1943|access-date=10 February 2019}} ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is freely available for re-use under the [[Open Government License]].''</ref>
{{blockquote|
The administration of the Dhufar Province is in the hands of the Sultan of Muscat himself. He appears to regard Dhufar more as a private estate than as a Province of his Sultanate and maintains a separate treasury. According to an article published some 65 years ago in the Nehla, a superior Arabic magazine of the last century, [[Turki bin Said, Sultan of Muscat and Oman|Sayyid Turki]], the present Sultan's grandfather, established his rule there at the invitation of the [[Sayyid#Oman|Sayyids]] of Salalah to forestall the unwelcome interest of the Turks. He entrusted the task of establishing Muscat authority to one Sulaiman bin Suwailim, a former slave, and supplied him with a small body of soldiers to secure the towns from the tribesmen. Sulaiman bin Suwailim built a fort on the site of the present palace which was later seized and looted by the [[Al Kathiri|Kathiri]], but it was not long before Muscat authority was re-established. His father took little interest in the Province but Sayyid [[Said bin Taimur]], the present Sultan, has now been in residence there for over a year, has a trained agricultural adviser and an engineer with him and is making great strides in developing the agricultural resources.

During [[World War I]] it was fertile enough to produce food and grain to supply a large proportion of the requirement of the [[British Army]] fighting in [[Mesopotamia]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

A [[counter-insurgency]] campaign—the [[Omani Civil War (1963-76)]]—was fought here by the [[Sultan of Oman's Armed Forces]] against [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] fighters of the nationalist [[Dhofar Liberation Front]] and later the Marxist [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman]] and the Persian Gulf (PFLOAG). This latter group was supported by [[Communism|Communist]] [[South Yemen]] and several other socialist states, including [[East Germany]]. It aimed to depose the Sultan's government, who was assisted by the United Kingdom, [[Iran]], and officers and doctors from [[Pakistan]] and India.<ref>In the service of the Sultan – Ian Gardiner</ref> The rebellion failed, and once the campaign was declared over in December 1975, the active remainder of PFLOAG forces surrendered.

==Population==
[[John Gordon Lorimer (1870-1914)|J.G. Lorimer]] noted in his 1908 manuscript, the ''[[Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia]]'', that the two main tribes of Dhofar were the mountain-dwelling Al Qara tribe (for which the [[Dhofar Mountains|Qara Mountain Range]] was named) and the [[Al Kathiri]] tribes (Al-Shanfari, Al-Rawas, Al-Marhoon, Bait Fadhil, Al-Mardoof and Al-Hadhri) who lived in the hills and in villages alike; both were reported to speak dialects of Arabic unknown in other parts of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Other tribes of importance noted by Lorimer included the Ja'afar tribe, the Bait Al Qalam tribe, the Sayid (or Sadat) tribe, the Hasarit tribe and the [[Harasis]] tribe. The inhabitants of Dhofar were described primarily as agriculturalists and were well known for their affinity to 'tobacco', possibly referring to [[khat]] which is similar in appearance.<ref name="535p1917"/> At the time of Lorimer's survey, Dhofar had roughly 11,000 inhabitants, the majority of which were [[Bedouin]]s.<ref name="536p1917">{{cite web|author=General Staff, India|url=https://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023909213.0x0000a8|title=Gazetteer of Arabia|location=Simla|publisher=East India Company, the Board of Control, the India Office, or other British Government Department|page=536|year=1917}}</ref>

In Gordon Noel Jackson's 1943 treatise on the Dhofar Governorate, he wrote that "the people of the province are as varied as the landscape".<ref name="jacksonp2"/> He goes on to state that the Arabs of the hills, 'mountain Arabs', were highly nomadic and were not proficient in [[Modern Standard Arabic|Standard Arabic]]. Furthermore, it is asserted that they were not overtly observant of Islamic customs, were highly superstitious, and practiced [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic rites]], much to the indignation of the Sultan of Oman. They engaged in little cultivation due to the arid landscape, instead preferring to trade incense and rear livestock.<ref name="jacksonp3">{{cite web|url=https://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023511755.0x000008|title=A note on the Dhufar Province, Southern Arabia|author=Gordon Noel Jackson|location=Kuwait|page=3|website=qdl.qa|publisher=East India Company, the Board of Control, the India Office, or other British Government Department|date=23 June 1943|access-date=10 February 2019}} ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is freely available for re-use under the [[Open Government License]].''</ref>

In the past, the [[Hindu]] festival [[Diwali]] was celebrated by practicing Omani Muslims and non-Muslims alike. According to local tradition, the custom was introduced by a [[Brahmin]] who was shipwrecked off Dhofar's coast and found a ready acceptance of the festival among the lower classes of Dhofar. Jackson (1943) states that the ruler of Oman prohibited Muslims from participating in these festivities sometime in the early 20th century.<ref name="jacksonp3"/>

While Arabic speakers from the dominant [[culture of Oman]] have come to live in the province, especially the larger cities and towns, Dhofar has been the traditional homeland of many tribespeople speaking [[Modern South Arabian languages]]. One of the languages most commonly spoken by Al-Hakli (Qara), Al-Shahri, Al-Barami, Al-Mashaiki and Al-Bathari mountain tribes is the [[Shehri language]] (called ''Jibbali'' "Mountainous"). The Yemeni language [[Mehri language|Mehri]] is somewhat linked to Jeballi. Other indigenous groups speaking smaller languages such as Bat'hari living in the coastal towns of Shuwaymiya and [[Sharbithat]]. The [[Harasis]], speaking [[Harsusi language|Harsusi]], number 1–2000 and live in [[Jiddat al-Harasis]].

==Geography==
===Topography===
[[File:Salalah road side.jpg|thumb|[[Coconut]] trees in the coastal area of [[Salalah]]]]
The Dhofar Governorate, situated in the western extremity of Oman's territories, is enclosed by the Indian Ocean on its southern side and by the [[Dhofar Mountains]], a semi-circular formation of mountains running into the sea at Ras Hamar and [[Mirbat]], which shut it off from the mountains and deserts to the north, east and west. South-west [[monsoon]] (locally referred to as [[Khareef]]) clouds driving up from the Indian Ocean are here met by winds from the north and east and buffeted and depressed until they are entrapped by the mountains over the Dhofar plain. Thus, Dhofar is unique on the Southern Arabian coast in that it enjoys monsoon rainfall for some three months of the year.<ref name="jacksonp1">{{cite web|url=https://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023511755.0x000004|title=A note on the Dhufar Province, Southern Arabia|author=Gordon Noel Jackson|location=Kuwait|page=1|website=qdl.qa|publisher=East India Company, the Board of Control, the India Office, or other British Government Department|date=23 June 1943|access-date=10 February 2019}} ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is freely available for re-use under the [[Open Government License]].''</ref>

The Province contains three distinct physical tracts, a cultivated coastal belt, [[Al Haffah]], divided from the mountains by a desert plain some 40 miles in length and up to 9 miles in depth. The mountains enclosing the western end of the plain are precipitous and inaccessible while those to the east rise steeply with many sheer cliffs and deep gorges but are capped by rolling grassy uplands and interspersed with wide park-like valleys well wooded with groves of [[Common fig|wild fig]]s, [[tamarind]]s, [[acacia]]s, [[sycamore]]s. Varieties of evergreens, [[privet]]s, [[Vachellia nilotica|babul]]s, wild olives, [[jasmine]]s, camel thorn, [[Tamarix|salt cedars]] and an abundance of wild flowers and grasses provide ample grazing during the summer for herds of dairy cattle, camels and goats numbering many hundreds.<ref name="jacksonp1"/>

[[File:Ayn Jarziz - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The natural spring of Ayn Jarziz was noted to facilitate the flow of approximately 40,000 gallons of water per hour in 1943.]]
The uplands rise gently to a height of between 3,000 and 4,000 feet at the top of the watershed and thence slope away to the north draining into Wadi Muqshin on the southern edge of the [[Rub' al Khali]] (Empty Quarter). Cloud formations are entrapped over the enclosed plain and on southern slopes of the mountains, the reverse slopes draining to the north being practically free of clouds and devoid of moisture. It is in these [[wadi]]s that the [[frankincense]], for which the mountains have been famous through the ages, grows wild. The dryness of the air determines the quality of the frankincense, the resin of similar trees growing on the southern slopes being spoilt by the rain.<ref name="jacksonp2">{{cite web|url=https://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023511755.0x000006|title=A note on the Dhufar Province, Southern Arabia|author=Gordon Noel Jackson|location=Kuwait|page=2|website=qdl.qa|publisher=East India Company, the Board of Control, the India Office, or other British Government Department|date=23 June 1943|access-date=10 February 2019}} ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is freely available for re-use under the [[Open Government License]].''</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Zerboni|first1=Andrea|last2=Perego|first2=Alessandro|last3=Mariani|first3=Guido S.|last4=Brandolini|first4=Filippo|last5=Kindi|first5=Mohammed Al|last6=Regattieri|first6=Eleonora|last7=Zanchetta|first7=Giovanni|last8=Borgi|first8=Federico|last9=Charpentier|first9=Vincent|last10=Cremaschi|first10=Mauro|date=9 December 2020|title=Geomorphology of the Jebel Qara and coastal plain of Salalah (Dhofar, southern Sultanate of Oman)|journal=Journal of Maps|volume=16|issue=2|pages=187–198|doi=10.1080/17445647.2019.1708488|doi-access=free|hdl=2434/698289|hdl-access=free}}</ref>

Although the southern slopes enjoy a good rainfall the ground soil does not retain the water. Underground rivers drain the waters of Jabal Aram into Wadi Darbat, the mouth of which is sealed by a sheer limestone cliff 500 feet high. The accumulated waters fill a lake two miles long, situated at a height of 1,000 feet, and overflow during the rains to form a picturesque waterfall. Other underground rivers feed perennial [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]]s at the foot of the hills. There are six of these springs; Jarziz, the best of them, producing an estimated flow of 40,000 gallons of water an hour. These waters, if unharnessed, again disappear underground in the foothills and reappear to feed extensive fresh water creeks in the coastal belt divided from the sea only by narrow [[Shoal#Sandbars and longshore bars|sandbars]]. Fresh water is easily obtainable from shallow wells at a distance of a hundred yards from high water mark and up to a distance of one mile inland, beyond which the increased depth of the water discourages prospective cultivators.<ref name="jacksonp2"/>

Dhofar's [[forest cover]] was estimated to be 53,000 hectares in 1989. However, due to human actives and deforestation, it declined to 10,000 hectares in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=مساحة الغابات في جبال محافظة ظفار تناقصت من 53 ألف هكتار إلى 10 آلاف هكتار خلال 23 عامًا|url=https://www.maf.gov.om/MediaCenter/NewsDetails/9729|url-status=live|access-date=3 July 2021|website=maf.gov.om|language=ar|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211015083430/https://www.maf.gov.om/MediaCenter/NewsDetails/9729 |archive-date=15 October 2021 }}</ref> The forests are home to more than 750 flora species – including 50 native species, which counts for more than 75% of Oman's biodiversity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afedmag.com/web/tabi3aFiSouwar-details.aspx?id=116&type=5&issue=6|title=هل تُستعاد غابات ظفار؟|language=ar|trans-title=Can Dhofar forests be restored?|publisher=[[Arab Forum for Environment and Development|Environment and Development Magazine]]|access-date=16 October 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=7 June 2015|title=محافظة ظفار تكثف جهودها لاستقبال موسم الخريف.. وتوقعات ببدء الموسم مبكرا هذا العام|url=https://alroya.om/post/135255/محافظة-ظفار-تكثف-جهودها-لاستقبال-موسم-الخريف-وتوقعات-ببدء-الموسم-مبكرا-هذا-العام|access-date=3 July 2021|website=جريدة الرؤية العمانية|language=ar}}</ref>
