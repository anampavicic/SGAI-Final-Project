==History==
NDMC has its origins in the Imperial Delhi Committee which was constituted on 25 March 1913 to overlook the construction of the new capital of India. Thereafter in February 1916 the Chief Commissioner, Delhi, created the Raisina Municipal Committee, which was upgraded to a 2nd class Municipality under the ''Punjab Municipal Act'' on 7 April 1925. Then on 22 February 1927, the Committee passed a resolution adopting the name "New Delhi" giving it the name, "New Delhi Municipal Committee", approved by Chief Commissioner on 16 March 1927.  In May 1994, the ''NDMC Act 1994'',<ref name=":0" /> replaced the ''Punjab Municipal Act 1911'', and the Committee was renamed as the New Delhi Municipal Council.<ref name=hto>{{cite news |title=Capital story: Managing a New Delhi |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Capital-story-Managing-a-New-Delhi/Article1-740284.aspx |work=Hindustan Times |date=1 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121208125953/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Capital-story-Managing-a-New-Delhi/Article1-740284.aspx |archive-date=8 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=NDMC History |url=http://www.ndmc.gov.in/AboutNDMC/History.aspx |work=NDMC website |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215025220/http://www.ndmc.gov.in/AboutNdmc/History.aspx |archive-date=15 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=NDMC - History |url=https://ndmc.gov.in/ndmc/history.aspx |access-date=2023-06-01 |website=ndmc.gov.in}}</ref>
