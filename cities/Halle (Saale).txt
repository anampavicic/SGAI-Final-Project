'''Halle (Saale)''', or simply '''Halle''' ({{IPA|de|ˈhalə|lang}}; from the 15th to the 17th century: ''Hall in Sachsen''; until the beginning of the 20th century: ''Halle an der Saale'' {{IPA|de|ˈhalə ʔan deːɐ̯ ˈzaːlə||De-Halle_(Saale).ogg}}; from 1965 to 1995: ''Halle/Saale'') is the largest city of the German [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Saxony-Anhalt]]. It is the fifth-most populous city in the area of former [[East Germany]] after ([[East Berlin|East]]) [[Berlin]], [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]] and [[Chemnitz]], as well as the [[List of cities in Germany by population|31st-largest city]] of Germany. With around 244,000<ref>{{Cite web |title=Quarterly Statistical Report of Halle, 1st quarter 2023 |url=https://informationsportal.halle.de/Informationsportal_Daten/Dateien/Ver%C3%B6ffentlichungen/Quartalsberichte/Quartal_1_2023.pdf}}</ref> inhabitants, it is slightly more populous than the state capital, [[Magdeburg]]. With Leipzig, the largest city of [[Saxony]], Halle forms the [[polycentric]] Leipzig-Halle conurbation. [[Leipzig/Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle International Airport]] lies between the two cities, in [[Schkeuditz]]. The Leipzig-Halle conurbation is at the heart of the larger [[Central German Metropolitan Region]].

Halle lies in the south of Saxony-Anhalt, in the [[Leipzig Bay]], the southernmost part of the [[North German Plain]], and is the largest city on the [[River Saale]] (a tributary of the [[Elbe]]), which is the third-longest river flowing entirely in Germany after the [[Weser]] and the [[Main (river)|Main]]. The [[White Elster]] flows into the Saale in the southern borough of Silberhöhe. Halle is the fourth-largest city in the [[Thuringian]]-[[Upper Saxon]] dialect area after Leipzig, Dresden and Chemnitz.

Halle is one of the main economic and educational centers of [[Central German Metropolitan Region|Central Germany]]. The [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg]], with campuses in Halle and [[Wittenberg]], is the largest university in Saxony-Anhalt and one of the oldest universities in Germany. The university hospital of Halle (''[[:de:Universitätsklinikum Halle (Saale)|Universitätsklinikum Halle (Saale)]]'') is the largest hospital in the state. The [[German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina|German National Academy of Sciences (''Leopoldina'')]] has its seat in Halle. Halle is an important radio hub - [[Halle Radio Tower]] is Germany's second-tallest lattice tower, and at night many public German radio stations from all over the country switch to the broadcasting center of [[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk]] in Halle which is responsible for the night program.

The [[Halle tramway]] is one of the most extensive German tramway networks, and [[Halle (Saale) Hauptbahnhof]] is the second-most important hub of the [[S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland]] rapid transit network after [[Leipzig Hauptbahnhof]]. The [[Saale-Elster Viaduct]], the longest bridge in Germany and longest high-speed rail bridge in Europe, which is part of the [[Erfurt–Leipzig/Halle high-speed railway]], runs through the southern borough of Planena.

The [[Nebra sky disc]] that was discovered in [[Nebra (Unstrut)|Nebra]] in the [[Unstrut]] valley between Halle and [[Erfurt]], is exhibited in the [[Halle State Museum of Prehistory]]. The city is the birthplace of composer [[George Frideric Handel]], who was born in the [[Handel House]] that has been converted into a music museum.

==Geography==
Halle (Saale) is located in the southern part of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] in central Germany, along the river [[Saale]] which drains the surrounding plains and the greater part of the neighboring [[Free State of Thuringia]] just to its south, and the Thuringian basin, northwards from the [[Thuringian Forest]]. Leipzig, one of Germany's major cities, is only {{convert|35|km}} away. Its area is {{cvt|135.01|km2}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://statistik.sachsen-anhalt.de/themen/gebiet-und-wahlen/gebiet/tabellen-bodenflaeche|title=Tabellen Bodenfläche|publisher=[[Statistisches Landesamt Sachsen-Anhalt]]|access-date=20 November 2022}}</ref>

===Climate===
[[Köppen climate classification]] classifies its climate as [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] (Cfb). However, it is close to being a [[Semi-arid climate|cold semi-arid climate]] (BSk). Using the most current climate data from April 2017 to March 2022, the annual precipitation is 17&nbsp;mm too much to be classified as a cold semi-arid climate.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wetterdienst.de/Deutschlandwetter/Halle_(Saale)/Klima/ |title=Klima Halle (Saale) |access-date= 25 April 2022 |publisher=DWD |language=de}}</ref> For example, using the climate data from September 2015 to August 2020, the climate would fulfill the requirements to be classified as a cold semi-arid climate.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wetterdienst.de/Deutschlandwetter/Halle_(Saale)/Klima/ |title=Klima Halle (Saale) |publisher=DWD |language=de |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200918095708/https://www2.wetterdienst.de/Deutschlandwetter/Halle_(Saale)/Klima/ |archive-date=18 September 2020}}</ref> Notwithstanding, the great variation of annual precipitation between the years allows agriculture and large trees to grow, surviving recurring drought periods and years like in the summers of [[2018 European heat wave|2018]] and [[2019 European heat wave|2019]] with severe drought because of regularly occurring wet periods and years and absence of extremely hot temperatures with never reaching {{convert|40|C}}. With its vegetation, Halle is far from the steppe or semi-desert vegetation typical of cold semi-arid climates.

==History==
{{For timeline}}
[[File:Halle Saale um 1900.jpg|thumb|left|Halle about 1900]]

===Name===
Halle's early history is connected with the harvesting of salt. The name of the river [[Saale]] contains the [[Germanic language|Germanic]] root for salt, and salt-harvesting has taken place in Halle since at least the [[Bronze Age]] (2300–600 BC).

From 1965 to 1995, the official name was '''Halle/Saale'''.

=== Middle Ages until industrialisation ===
The earliest documented mention of Halle dates from AD 806. It became a part of the [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg]] in the 10th century and remained so until 1680, when the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] annexed it together with [[Magdeburg]] as the [[Duchy of Magdeburg]], while it was an important location for [[Martin Luther]]'s [[Reformation]] in the 16th century. Cardinal [[Albert of Mainz]] ([[Archbishop of Magdeburg]] from 1513 to 1545) also impacted on the town in this period. According to historic documents, the city of Halle became a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] at least as early as 1281.

Halle became a center for [[Pietism]], a movement encouraged by King [[Frederick William I of Prussia]] (reigned 1713–1740) because it caused the area's large [[Lutheran]] population to be more inclined to Fredrick William I's religion ([[Calvinism]]), as well as more loyal to the Prussian king instead of to the decentralized feudal system. By the 1740s Halle had established many orphanages as well as schools for the wealthy in the sober style Pietism encouraged. This Halle education was the first time the "modern education" system was established.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The Halle Pietists also combatted poverty.<ref>{{cite book

During the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]], French and Prussian forces clashed in the [[Battle of Halle]] on 17 October 1806. The fighting moved from the covered bridges on the city's west side, through the streets and market place, to the eastern suburbs.

In 1815 Halle became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[Province of Saxony]].

===World War II (1939–1945)===
[[File:Kleinschmieden in Halle (Saale).jpg|thumb|left|Halle survived the Second World War almost unscathed and still has an intact cityscape today.]]
During [[World War II]], [[Halle concentration camp|KZ-Außenlager Birkhahn]], a [[List of subcamps of Buchenwald|subcamp]] of [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]] was in Halle, where prisoners from Poland, Czechoslovakia, the [[Soviet Union]], France, Netherlands and other nations<ref>Das vergessene Lager: Eine Dokumentation zum Außenkommando des KZ Buchenwald in Halle/Saale 1944/45</ref> were [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced to work]] in the [[Siebel]] aircraft plants, making combat aircraft. The plant was later dismantled. In [[Ammendorf/Beesen|Ammendorf]], a large factory owned by {{Interlanguage link multi|Orgacid|de}} produced [[mustard gas]].

Near the end of World War II, there were two bombing raids carried out against the town: the first on 31 March 1945, the second a few days later. The first attack took place between the railway station and the city's centre, and the second bombing was in the southern district. It killed over 1,000 inhabitants and destroyed 3,600 buildings. Among them, are the [[Marktkirche Unser Lieben Frauen|Market Church]], St. George Church, the Old Town Hall, the municipal theatre, historic buildings on Bruederstrasse and on Grosse Steinstrasse, and the city cemetery.

On 17 April 1945, American soldiers occupied Halle, and the Red Tower was set on fire by artillery and destroyed. The Market Church and the Church of St. George received more hits. However, the city was spared further damage because an aerial bombardment was canceled, after former naval officer [[Felix von Luckner]] negotiated the city's surrender to the American army. In July, the Americans withdrew and the city was occupied by the [[Red Army]].

===German Democratic Republic (1949–1990)===
After World War II, Halle served as the capital of the short-lived administrative region of Saxony-Anhalt until 1952, when the East German government abolished its "Länder" (states). As a part of [[East Germany]] (until 1990), it functioned as the capital of the administrative district (''Bezirk'') of Halle.

===Since German unity (after 1990)===
When [[Saxony-Anhalt]] was re-established as a ''[[Land (Germany)|Bundesland]]'' in 1990, [[Magdeburg]], not Halle, became the capital.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Berentsen |first=William H. |title=Saxony-Anhalt (State, Germany) |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Saxony-Anhalt}}</ref>

On 9 October 2019, two people were killed in a [[Halle synagogue shooting|shooting incident at a synagogue]] in Halle. The [[Generalbundesanwalt|Federal Prosecutor]] (Generalbundesanwalt) classified the attack as an act of [[right-wing terrorism]] stemming from [[antisemitism]]; as a consequence security measures at Jewish facilities were increased.

Halle has a population of about 238,000 and is the largest city in [[Saxony-Anhalt]] State. In the [[East Germany]] era, Halle had a lot of big industry with many workplaces. At the time Halle was one of the leading cities in East Germany, along with [[Leipzig]] and [[Dresden]]. Halle reached its highest population in 1991 with about 305,000 people. Since [[German reunification]], Halle's population began to decline due to its loss of industry, with many people moving to former [[West Germany]]. Halle is now considered one of the poorest cities in Germany. Halle's foreign population began to grow in 2015 after refugees from Syria and other war torn countries moved to Halle.

==Industrial heritage==

Salt, also known as ''white gold'', was extracted from four "Borns" (well-like structures). The four Borns/brine named Gutjahrbrunnen, Meteritzbrunnen, Deutscher Born and Hackeborn, were located around the Hallmarket (or "Under Market"), now a market square with a fountain, just across from the TV station, [[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk|MDR]]. The [[brine]] was highly concentrated and boiled in ''Koten'', simple structured houses made from reed and clay. Salters, who wore a unique uniform with eighteen silver buttons, were known as ''Halloren'', and this name was later used for the chocolates in the shape of these buttons.

The [[Halloren Chocolate Factory|Halloren-Werke]], the oldest chocolate factory in Germany, was founded in 1804. Old documents are on display and a chocolate room can be visited.

Within [[East Germany]], Halle's chemical industry, now mainly shut down, was of great importance. The two main companies in the region were [[Buna Werke Schkopau|Buna-Werke]] and [[Leuna]], and [[Halle-Neustadt]] was built in the 1960s to accommodate the employees of these two factories.

==Science and culture==
[[Baroque]] composer [[Georg Friedrich Händel]] (later ''George Frideric Handel'') was born in Halle in 1685 and spent the first 17 years of his life in the city. The house where he lived is now a museum about his life. To celebrate his music, Halle has staged a [[Handel Festival, Halle|Handel Festival]] since 1922, annually in June since 1952. The [[August Hermann Francke|''Franckesche Stiftungen'']] (Francke Foundations) are home to the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Stadtsingechor zu Halle|de}}'', which was founded before the year 1116 and is one of the oldest boys' choirs in the world.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The [[University of Halle]] was founded here in 1694. It is now combined with the [[University of Wittenberg]] and called the ''[[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg]]''. The university's medical school was established by [[Friedrich Hoffmann]]. Its [[botanical garden]], the [[Botanische Garten der Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg]], dates back to 1698. Halle's [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]] is the oldest and one of the most respected scientific societies in Germany.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Halle is also home to Germany's oldest Protestant church library, known as the {{Interlanguage link multi|Marienbibliothek|de}}, with 27,000 titles.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The seat of the [[Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology]], one of the world's largest social anthropological research institutions and a part of the [[Max Planck Society]], is in Halle.

Halle was a centre of German [[Pietism]] and played an important role in establishing the [[Lutheran]] church in North America, when [[Henry Muhlenberg]] and others were sent as missionaries to [[Pennsylvania]] in the mid-18th century. Muhlenberg is now called the first Patriarch of the Lutheran Church in America. He and his son, [[Frederick Muhlenberg]], who was the first [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]], were graduates of Halle University.

The Silver Treasure of the ''Halloren'' is displayed occasionally at the Technical Museum Saline. It is a unique collection of silver and gold goblets dating back to 1266. The ancient craft of "Schausieden" (boiling of the brine) can be observed there too. The State Museum of Prehistory houses the [[Nebra sky disk]], a significant Bronze-Age find with astronomical significance.

Halle Zoo contributes to the [[EAZA]] breeding programme, in particular for the Angolan lion and the [[Malaysian tiger]]. Halle is also known for its thriving [[coypu]] (or nutria) population, which is native to South America.

With writers such as [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]], [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff|Eichendorff]], [[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]], [[Ludwig Tieck|Tieck]] and [[Novalis]] the town was a vibrant scene of the [[German Romanticism]]. Also [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] was a regular guest at the house of his close friend [[Johann Friedrich Reichardt]].

German-American [[Expressionism|expressionist]] painter [[Lyonel Feininger]] worked in Halle on an invitation by the city from 1929 to 1931. As one of eleven views of the city termed ''Halle Cycle'', he painted in 1931 ''Die Türme über der Stadt''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ids.lib.harvard.edu/ids/view/14334710?width=560&height=560 |title=Painting |website=ids.lib.harvard.edu |access-date=9 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402181607/http://ids.lib.harvard.edu/ids/view/14334710?width=560&height=560 |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> (The towers above the city), which is now in the [[Museum Ludwig]] in Cologne.<ref name=feininger>{{cite web |url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,4101403,00.html |publisher=Deutsche Welle |title=Halle – A City of Five Towers Between the Past and Present |access-date=1 January 2012}} {{Dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> This painting appeared on a 55 [[Euro coins|eurocent]] stamp on 5 December 2002 as a part of the series "Deutsche Malerei des 20.

==Transport history==
[[Ludwig Wucherer]] made Halle an important rail hub in central Germany. In 1840 he opened the [[Magdeburg-Leipzig Railway|Magdeburg-Halle-Leipzig line]], completing a connection between [[Magdeburg]] and [[Dresden]]. From 1841 to 1860, other lines to [[Thuringian Railway|Erfurt]], [[Halle-Kassel Railway|Kassel]] and [[Anhalt Railway|Berlin]] followed.

The centrepiece of Halle's urban public transport system is the [[Trams in Halle (Saale)|Halle (Saale) tramway network]]. It includes the world's first major electric-powered inner-city tram line, which was opened in 1891.<ref>Wolfgang König, Wolfhard Weber: Netzwerke. Stahl und Strom. 1840 bis 1914. In: Propyläen Technikgeschichte. Bd. 4, Propyläen Verlag, Berlin 1991–1992, {{ISBN|3-549-07113-2}}, p. 344.</ref> [[Halle (Saale) Hauptbahnhof]] is the main railway station.

Halle's prominence as a railway centre grew with the arrival of the [[Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle high-speed railway]]. Leipzig is also connected to this route, but since it is mostly a terminus station (the [[Leipzig City Tunnel]], opened in 2013, is mostly used by suburban S-Bahn trains and unsuitable for the high-speed network) and the route via Halle is shorter, Halle is used as an intermediate stop by many Berlin-Munich trains.

[[Leipzig/Halle Airport]] (opened in 1927) is an international airport located in Schkeuditz, Saxony, and serves both Leipzig, Saxony, and Halle, Saxony-Anhalt. {{asof|2018}} it is Germany's 11th largest airport by passengers, handling more than 2.57 million mainly with flights to European leisure destinations. In terms of cargo traffic, the airport is the fifth-busiest in Europe and the second-busiest in Germany after [[Frankfurt Airport]].

==Sports==
[[File:Erdgas Sportpark 20180407 02.jpg|thumb|[[Erdgas Sportpark]] home of [[Hallescher FC]]]]
The football team ''Hallescher FC Wacker 1900'' had some regional importance before World War II. In the German Championship ''Wacker'' reached the semi-finals in 1921, and the quarter-finals in 1928. The successor team became East German champions in 1949 and 1952 under the names of ''ZSG Union'' and ''BSG Turbine Halle''. From these evolved today's ''[[Turbine Halle]]'' and ''[[Hallescher FC]]''. In the era of the German Democratic Republic, the latter club (as ''Chemie Halle'' ) was a mainstay in the first division and won the Cup tournament in 1956 and 1962. The most prominent player was 72-times international [[Bernd Bransch]], who was with ''Chemie'' in the 1960s and 1970s. These days, ''Hallescher FC'' usually plays in the third division.

The general sports club ''{{Interlanguage link multi|SV Halle|de}}'', originating from ''Chemie Halle'', created a notable number of Olympic gold medallists and world champions, mainly in nautical and watersports, e.g., swimmer [[Kornelia Ender]] won four Olympic gold medals in 1976 and [[Andreas Hajek]] won four rowing world championships between 1998 and 2001. The basketball team of the club – these days known as ''Lions'' and focusing on the woman's team which plays in the national first division – won five men's and 10 women's championships of the German Democratic Republic.
The Hallescher FC's location is extremely close to a train station.
