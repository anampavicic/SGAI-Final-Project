'''Savannakhet''' ({{langx|lo|ສະຫວັນນະເຂດ}}, {{IPA-lo|sā.wǎn nā(ʔ).kʰȅːt|pron}}) is a [[Provinces of Laos|province]] of [[Laos]]. The name derives from ''Savanh Nakhone'' ('heavenly district' or 'land of fertility suitable for agriculture') the province's original name. It bears the same meaning as [[Nakhon Sawan]], a city in [[Thailand]].

The province is in the southern part of the country and is the largest province in Laos. It borders [[Khammouane province]] to the north, [[Quảng Trị province|Quảng Trị]] and [[Thừa Thiên–Huế province|Thừa Thiên–Huế]] provinces of [[Vietnam]] to the east, [[Salavan province]] to the south, and [[Nakhon Phanom province|Nakhon Phanom]] and [[Mukdahan province|Mukdahan]] provinces of Thailand to the west. The [[Second Thai–Lao Friendship Bridge]] over the [[Mekong River]] connects Mukdahan province in Thailand with Savannakhet in Laos. Its capital, [[Savannakhet]], also known as ''Kaysone Phomvihane'' or ''Muang Khanthabouly'' is Laos' second largest city after [[Vientiane]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} It forms an important trading post between Thailand and Vietnam.

Along with [[Bolikhamsai province|Bolikhamsai]] and Khammouane provinces, Savannakhet is one of the main [[tobacco]] producing areas of Laos. It has numerous natural resources. [[Xépôn]] is the site of the largest mine in Laos, with reserves of copper and gold. During the [[Iron Age]], copper smelting and copper mining was held at the archaeological site [[Vilabouly Complex, Laos|Vilabouly Complex]].

==History==
Prehistoric human occupation is evidenced by the first stone tools in the province, dating back between 100,000 and 12,000 years. The first bronze tools date to 2000 BCE. The region was then the center of the Sikhottabong Kingdom. The much-venerated Pha That Sikhottabong [[stupa]] is on the grounds of a 19th-century monastery in [[Thakhek]].<ref name="lonelyplanet.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/laos/sights/other/pha-that-sikhottabong|title=Pha That Sikhottabong|publisher=Lonely Planet/BBC Worldwide|access-date=12 December 2012}}</ref> Sikhottabong was an important kingdom in ancient Indo-China.<ref name="Rasdavong2006" />  Its capital was in the north-west of the province, in the present village of Meuang Kabong, on the eastern shores of the [[Banghiang River]], about {{convert|10|km}} east of the Mekong.

During the [[Vietnam War]], the eastern part of the province was crossed by the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]]. It was heavily bombed by U.S. forces and loyalists. Some areas are still under the threat of [[unexploded ordnance]]. In 2007, the [[Second Thai–Lao Friendship Bridge]] was opened across the Mekong from Savannakhet to [[Mukdahan|Mukdahan, Thailand]]. In April 2008, a chance discovery was made at Meuang Kabong consisting of {{convert|8.5|kg}} of gold and {{convert|18.7|kg}} of silver objects, as well as pillars and traces of brick walls. Many missionaries came here, evidenced by a Catholic church in Savannakhet.<ref name="CranmerMartin2002">{{cite book|last1=Cranmer|first1=Jeff|last2=Martin|first2=Steven|last3=Coxon|first3=Kirby|title=Laos|url=https://archive.org/details/laos0000cran|url-access=registration|access-date=11 December 2012|date=1 November 2002|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-85828-905-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/laos0000cran/page/268 268]–}}</ref>
