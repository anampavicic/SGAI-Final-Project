== Etymology ==
The name ''Ingushetia'' ({{lang|ru|Ингушетия}}) derives from the Russian name of the Ingush, which in turn is derived from the ancient Ingush village [[Angusht]], and from the [[Georgian language|Georgian]] suffix -''éti''.{{sfn|Nichols|1997}} The name in Ingush is ''Ghalghaaichie'' ({{lang|inh|Гӏалгӏайче}}, /ʁalʁaitʃe/).{{sfn|Nichols|Sprouse|2004|p=255}}

In the 1920–1930s there was not yet a unifying name for the [[Ingush Autonomous Oblast]]. Although the ''oblast'' was officially called ''Ingushetia'', some scientists like {{ill|Nikolai Yakovlev (linguist)|lt=Nikolai Yakovlev|ru|Яковлев, Николай Феофанович}} and {{ill|Leonid Semyonov|ru|Семёнов, Леонид Петрович}} insisted that its correct name is ''Ingushiya'' ({{lang|ru|Ингушия}}).{{sfn|Shnirelman|2006|p=209}}

This assertion is mostly based on the document signed on 13 June 1810 by General-Major Delpotso and representatives of two Ingush clans; most other clans resisted the Russian conquest. In 1811, at the Tsar's request, [[Moritz von Engelhardt]], a Russian envoy of German origin visited the mountainous region of Ingushetia and tried to induce the Ingush people to join Russia, promising many benefits offered by the Tsar. The representative of the Ingush people rejected the proposal with the reply: "Above my hat I see only sky". This encounter was later used by [[Goethe]] in his 1815 poem, [[Freisinn (Goethe)|"Freisinn"]] ('free spirit').<ref>{{cite book |last1=Viehoff |first1=Henrich |title=Periode des eklestischen Universalismus 1806-1832.

On 23 February 1944, Ingush and Chechens were falsely accused of collaborating with the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]], and the entire Ingush and Chechen populations were deported to [[Kazakhstan]], [[Uzbekistan]], and [[Siberia]] in [[Deportation of the Chechens and Ingush|Operation Lentil]], on the orders of Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]], while the majority of their men were fighting on the front. The initial phase of the deportation was carried out on American-supplied [[Studebaker]] trucks specifically modified with three submachine gun-nest compartments above the deported to prevent escapes.

The deportees were gathered on the railroad stations and during the second phase transferred to the cattle railroad carts.

After 13 years of exile, the Ingush were allowed to return to Chechen-Ingushetia (but not to Ordzhonikidze a.k.a. "[[Vladikavkaz]]" or the [[Prigorodny District, Republic of North Ossetia–Alania|Prigorodny District]]). Most of Ingushetia's territory had been settled by [[Ossetians]] and part of the region had been transferred to [[North Ossetia–Alania|North Ossetia]]. The returning Ingush faced considerable animosity from the Ossetians. The Ingush were forced to buy their homes back from the Ossetians and Russians. These hardships and injustices led to a peaceful Ingush protest in [[Grozny]] on 16 January 1973, which was crushed by Soviet troops<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ingushetiya.ru/news/12884.html |title=35 years later.

===Post-Soviet period===
In 1991, when the Chechens declared independence from the [[Soviet Union]] to form the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]], the Ingush chose to secede from the Chechen-Ingush Republic. This was confirmed with the [[Ingush referendum 1991|referendum]] and in 1992 the Ingush joined the newly created Russian Federation to try to resolve the conflict with Ossetia peacefully, also in the hope that the Russians would return their land as a token of their loyalty.

===Ethnic cleansing of 1992===
However, ethnic tensions in North Ossetia which were orchestrated by Ossetian nationalists (per Helsinki Human Right Watch), led to an outbreak of violence in the [[Ossetian–Ingush conflict]] in October–November 1992, when another [[ethnic cleansing]] of the Ingush population started.<ref>Economist 1992. Ethnic cleansing comes to Russia. ''The Economist'', 28 November 1992, p. 60.</ref>

Over 60,000 Ingush civilians were forced from their homes in the [[Prigorodny District, Republic of North Ossetia–Alania|Prigorodny District]] of North Ossetia.<ref name="ingush.berkeley.edu"/> As a result of the conflict, pro-Russian general [[Ruslan Aushev]], a decorated war hero from the War in Afghanistan, was appointed by the Russian government as the first president of Ingushetia to stop the spread of the conflict. Partial stability returned under his rule.

===First and Second Chechen Wars===
{{Broader|First Chechen War|Second Chechen War}}
In 1994, when the [[First Chechen War]] started, the number of refugees in Ingushetia from both conflicts doubled. According to the [[UN]], for every citizen of Ingushetia, one refugee arrived from Ossetia or Chechnya. This influx was very problematic for the economy, which collapsed after Aushev's success. The second Russo-Chechen war which started in 1999 brought more refugees (at some point there was one refugee for every Ingush citizen: 240,000 from Chechnya plus 60,000 from North Ossetia at the peak in 2000) and misery to Ingushetia. In 2001, Aushev was forced to leave his presidency and was succeeded by [[Murat Zyazikov]], a former [[KGB]] general. The situation worsened under his rule. Many young Ingush men were abducted by Russian and [[Ossetia]]n [[death squad]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ingushetia.org/news/12939.html |title=A message of Nazir Evloev Press Secretary of Ingushetia MVD (Police) |access-date=20 January 2008 |author=N.

The number of rebel attacks in Ingushetia rose, especially after the number of Russian security forces was tripled. For example, according to a Russian news agency a murder of an [[Russians|ethnic-Russian]] school teacher in Ingushetia was committed by two ethnic-[[Russians|Russian]] and ethnic-Ossetian soldiers; Issa Merzhoev the Ingush Police detective who solved the crime was shot at and killed by "unknown" assailants shortly after he had identified the murderer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gazeta.ru/social/2007/08/29/2103857.shtml |title=The Murderers are not Insurgents |access-date=29 September 2007 |author=B.Polonkoev |date=August 2007 |work=[[www.gazeta.ru]] |archive-date=29 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201029201114/https://www.gazeta.ru/social/2007/08/29/2103857.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref>
At least four people were injured when a vehicle exploded on 24 March 2008. An upsurge in violence in these months targeted local police officers and security forces.

===Military history===
According to professor [[Johanna Nichols]], in all the recorded history and reconstructable [[prehistory]], the [[Ingush people]] have never undertaken battle except in defense.<ref name="ingush.berkeley.edu" /> In the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC [[Pharnavaz I of Iberia|Pharnavaz]], his son [[Saurmag I of Iberia|Saurmag]] the [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]]n kings, and the relatives of Ingush people per [[Leonti Mroveli]], received military assistance from Ingush people in defense of Iberia against the [[Kartli]] occupation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ingushetiya.ru/article/95.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217060433/http://www.ingushetiya.ru/article/95.html |archive-date=17 February 2008 |title=The Land of Towers |author=Khasan Sampiev}}</ref>

During [[World War I]], 500 cavalrymen from an Ingush regiment of the [[Wild Division]] attacked the German Iron Division. The [[Russian Emperor]] [[Nicholas II]], assessing the performance of the Ingush and Chechen regiments during the Brusilov breakthrough on the Russian-German front in 1915 wrote in a telegram to the Governor-General of the Tersky region Fleisher:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chechnyafree.ru/index.php?lng=eng&section=historyeng&row=11 |title=Чечня FREE.RU – Новости Чечни, России и мира |website=Чечня FREE.RU |access-date=2 July 2007 |archive-date=13 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313002521/http://www.chechnyafree.ru/index.php?lng=eng&section=historyeng&row=11 |url-status=live }}</ref>
{{blockquote|text=The Ingush regiment pounced upon the German "Iron Division" like an avalanche. It was immediately supported by the Chechen regiment. The Russian history, including the history of our Preobrazhensky regiment, does not know a single instance of a horse cavalry attacking an enemy force armed with heavy artillery: 4.5 thousand killed, 3.5 thousand taken prisoner, 2.5 thousand wounded. Less than in an hour and a half the "Iron Division" ceased to exist, the division that had aroused fear in the best armies of our allies. On behalf of me, the royal court and the whole of the Russian army send our best regards to fathers, mothers, sisters, wives and brides of those brave sons of the Caucasus whose heroism paved the way for the destruction of German hordes. Russia bows low to the heroes and will never forget them. I extend my fraternal greetings, Nicholas II, August 25, 1915.}}

In 1994–1996 Ingush volunteers fought alongside Chechens in the [[First Chechen War]]. Aside from a few incidents (including the killings of Ingush civilians by Russian soldiers), Ingushetia was largely kept out of the war by a determined policy of non-violence pursued by President [[Ruslan Aushev]].<ref name="ingush.berkeley.edu"/>

This changed after the beginning of the [[Second Chechen War]], and especially since [[Murat Zyazikov]] became the second Russian appointed president of Ingushetia in 2002. The first major rebel attack of the conflict, in which [[Galashki ambush|a military convoy was destroyed]] occurred in May 2000 and caused the deaths of 19 soldiers. In the [[June 2004 Nazran raid]], [[Chechen people|Chechen]] and Ingush rebels attacked government buildings and military bases across Ingushetia, resulting in the deaths of at least 90 Ingush people and an unknown number of Russian troops. Among them the Republic's acting interior minister Abukar Kostoyev, his deputy Zyaudin Kotiyev. In response to a sharp escalation in attacks by insurgents since the summer of 2007,<ref>[http://www.peaceinthecaucasus.org/IngushetiaTimeline.pdf TIMELINE OF VIOLENCE IN INGUSHETIA: SUMMER-FALL 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031043458/http://www.peaceinthecaucasus.org/IngushetiaTimeline.pdf |date=31 October 2008 }}</ref> [[Moscow]] sent in an additional 25,000 MVD and FSB troops, tripling the number of special forces in Ingushetia.

==Politics==
Up until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution]] of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet state]], Ingushetia was part of the [[Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Chechen-Ingush ASSR]] of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. In the late 1920s – early 1930s the Soviet officials were eager to enforce the Chechen-Ingush merger as an "objective" and "natural" process. The Soviet linguist Nikolay Yakovlev, who was a supporter of the merger, suggested that an inclusive name of "Veinakh" ("our people") had to be used for both the Chechens and Ingush. According to his views, the rapid urbanization and rapprochement of the Chechens and Ingush within one and the same republic might encourage the formation of a common culture and language and the establishment of a unified "Veinakh" people.

During the late '80s, together with the separatist tendencies across the Soviet Union, the Second [[Congress of the Ingush People]] was held in [[Grozny]] on 9–10 September 1989. The gathering was directed at the top leadership of the Soviet Union, and included a request to "restore the Ingush people's autonomy within their historical borders, the Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic with a capital in the right-bank part of the city of [[Vladikavkaz|Ordzhonikidze]]". The Ingush Republic was to be organized out of six traditional Ingush districts (including the contested [[Prigorodny District, North Ossetia-Alania|Prigorodny District]]). The rise of the Russian Federation - and the 1991 [[Chechen Revolution]] - gave the Ingushetians the independence they vowed for and in 1992 the remainder of Checheno-Ingushstia became thus the Republic of Ingushtia. During the 1990s, Ingushetia was ruled by its elected president [[Ruslan Aushev]], a former Soviet general and hero of the [[Soviet–Afghan War|war in Afghanistan]].

The head of government and the highest executive post in Ingushetia is the [[Head of Ingushetia|Head]], elected by representatives of the Parliament of Ingushetia.

===Ethnic groups===
[[File:Экскурсия в горную Ингушетию (01).jpg|thumb|Ingush People]]
According to the [[Russian Census (2021)|2021 Russian census]],<ref name="2021 pop by const"/> ethnic [[Ingush people|Ingush]] make up 96.4% of the republic's population. The Ingush, a nationality group indigenous to the [[Caucasus]], mostly inhabit Ingushetia. They refer to themselves as Ghalghaj (from Ingush: ''Ghala'' ('fortress' or 'town') and ''ghaj'' ('inhabitants' or 'citizens'). The Ingush speak the [[Ingush language]], which has a very high degree of mutual intelligibility with neighboring [[Chechen language|Chechen]].

Other groups include [[Chechen people|Chechens]] (2.5%), [[Russians]] (0.7%), and a host of smaller groups, each accounting for less than 0.5% of the total population.<ref name=census2021>{{cite web |title=Национальный состав населения |url=https://rosstat.gov.ru/storage/mediabank/Tom5_tab1_VPN-2020.xlsx |website=[[Federal State Statistics Service (Russia)|Federal State Statistics Service]] |access-date=30 December 2022 |archive-date=30 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221230204643/https://rosstat.gov.ru/storage/mediabank/Tom5_tab1_VPN-2020.xlsx |url-status=live }}</ref>

*[[Terek River]]
*[[Assa River (Sunzha River)|Assa River]]
*[[Sunzha River]]

===Natural resources===
Ingushetia is rich in [[marble]], [[timber]], [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]], [[plaster]], [[limestone]], [[gravel]], [[granite]], [[clay]], [[geothermal energy|thermal]] medical water, [[rare metal]]s, [[mineral water]], [[Petroleum|oil]] (over 60 billion tons), and [[natural gas]] reserves.

* Average January temperature: {{convert|-10|C}}
* Average July temperature: {{convert|21|C}}
* Average annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]: {{cvt|450|-|650|mm}}

==Economy==
There are some natural resources in Ingushetia: [[mineral water]] in Achaluki, [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] in Malgobek, [[forests]] in Dzheirakh, [[metals]] in Galashki. The local government is considering the development of [[tourism]]; however, this is problematic due to the uneasy situation in the republic itself and the proximity of some conflict zones. However, Ingushetia continues to remain as one of Russia's poorest republics, largely due to the ongoing conflict, corruption and civil disorders. Unemployment is estimated to be around 53%, and growing poverty is a major issue.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ingushetia wants to attract Chinese tourists |url=https://tass.com/society/975847 |access-date=23 November 2021 |website=TASS |archive-date=23 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211123210020/https://tass.com/society/975847 |url-status=live }}</ref>
