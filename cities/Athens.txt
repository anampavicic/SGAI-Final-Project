The heritage of the [[Classical Greece|Classical Era]] is still evident in the city, represented by [[ancient monument]]s, and works of art, the most famous of all being the [[Parthenon]], considered a key landmark of early [[Western culture]]. The city also retains [[Roman Greece|Roman]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and a smaller number of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] monuments, while its historical urban core features elements of continuity through its millennia of history. Athens is home to two [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]], the [[Acropolis of Athens]] and the medieval [[Daphni Monastery]]. Athens is also home to several museums and cultural institutions, such as the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archeological Museum]], featuring the world's largest collection of ancient Greek antiquities, the [[Acropolis Museum]], the [[Goulandris Museum of Cycladic Art|Museum of Cycladic Art]], the [[Benaki Museum]], and the [[Byzantine and Christian Museum]].

== Etymology and names==
{{Further|Names of European cities in different languages (A)}}

In [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]], the name of the city was {{lang|grc|Ἀθῆναι}} (''Athênai'', {{IPA-grc|atʰɛ̂ːnai̯|pron}} in [[Attic Greek|Classical Attic]]), which is a plural word. In earlier Greek, such as [[Homeric Greek]], the name had been current in the singular form though, as {{lang|grc|Ἀθήνη}} (''Athḗnē'').<ref>As for example in [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+7&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0135 Od.7.80] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210418015639/https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+7&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0135 |date=18 April 2021 }}</ref> It was possibly rendered in the plural later on, like those of {{lang|grc|Θῆβαι}} (''[[Thebes, Greece|Thêbai]]'') and {{lang|grc|Μυκῆναι}} (''[[Mycenae|Μukênai]]''). The root of the word is probably not of Greek or [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] origin,<ref name="Beekes2009">{{Citation |last=Beekes |first=Robert S. P. |title=Etymological Dictionary of Greek |date=2009 |page=29 |place=Leiden and Boston |publisher=Brill |author-link=Robert Beekes}}</ref> and is possibly a remnant of the [[Pre-Greek substrate]] of Attica.<ref name="Beekes2009" /> In antiquity, it was debated whether Athens took its name from its patron goddess [[Athena]] ([[Attic Greek|Attic]] {{lang|grc|Ἀθηνᾶ}}, ''Athēnâ'', [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] {{lang|grc|Ἀθήνη}}, ''Athḗnē'', and [[Doric Greek|Doric]] {{lang|grc|Ἀθάνα}}, ''Athā́nā'') or Athena took her name from the city.<ref name="Burkert1985">{{Citation |last=Burkert |first=Walter |title=Greek Religion |date=1985 |url=https://archive.org/details/greekreligion0000burk/page/139 |page=[https://archive.org/details/greekreligion0000burk/page/139 139] |place=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-36281-0 |author-link=Walter Burkert}}</ref> Modern scholars now generally agree that the goddess takes her name from the city,<ref name="Burkert1985" /> because the ending -''ene'' is common in names of locations, but rare for personal names.<ref name="Burkert1985" />

According to the ancient Athenian [[founding myth]], Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war, competed against [[Poseidon]], the God of the Seas, for patronage of the yet-unnamed city;<ref name="Kerényi1951">{{Citation |last=Kerényi |first=Karl |title=The Gods of the Greeks |date=1951 |url=https://archive.org/details/godsofgreeks00kerrich/page/124 |page=[https://archive.org/details/godsofgreeks00kerrich/page/124 124] |place=London, England |publisher=Thames and Hudson |isbn=0-500-27048-1 |author-link=Károly Kerényi |url-access=registration}}</ref> they agreed that whoever gave the Athenians the better gift would become their patron<ref name="Kerényi1951" /> and appointed [[Cecrops I|Cecrops]], the king of Athens, as the judge.<ref name="Kerényi1951" /> According to the account given by [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Pseudo-Apollodorus]], Poseidon struck the ground with his [[Trident of Poseidon|trident]] and a salt water spring welled up.<ref name="Kerényi1951" /> In an alternative version of the myth from [[Vergil]]'s poem ''[[Georgics]]'', Poseidon instead gave the Athenians the first horse.<ref name="Kerényi1951" /> In both versions, Athena offered the Athenians the first domesticated [[olive tree]].<ref name="Kerényi1951" /><ref name="Garland2008">{{Cite book |last=Garland |first=Robert |title=Ancient Greece: Everyday Life in the Birthplace of Western Civilization |date=2008 |publisher=Sterling |isbn=978-1-4549-0908-8 |location=New York}}</ref> Cecrops accepted this gift<ref name="Kerényi1951" /> and declared Athena the patron goddess of Athens.<ref name="Kerényi1951" /><ref name="Garland2008" /> Eight different etymologies, now commonly rejected, have been proposed since the 17th century. [[Christian Lobeck]] proposed as the root of the name the word {{lang|grc|ἄθος}} (''áthos'') or {{lang|grc|ἄνθος}} (''ánthos'') meaning "flower", to denote Athens as the "flowering city". [[Johann Christoph Wilhelm Ludwig Döderlein|Ludwig von Döderlein]] proposed the stem of the verb {{lang|grc|θάω}}, stem θη- (''tháō'', ''thē-'', "to suck") to denote Athens as having fertile soil.<ref>''[[Great Greek Encyclopedia]]'', vol. II, Athens 1927, p. 30.</ref> Athenians were called [[cicada]]-wearers ({{langx|grc|Τεττιγοφόροι|links=no}}) because they used to wear pins of golden cicadas. A symbol of being [[Autochthon (ancient Greece)|autochthonous]] (earth-born), because the legendary founder of Athens, [[Erechtheus]] was an autochthon or of being musicians, because the cicada is a "musician" insect.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ToposText |url=https://topostext.org/work/240#tau.377 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225005003/https://topostext.org/work/240#tau.377 |archive-date=25 February 2021 |access-date=27 March 2020 |website=topostext.org}}</ref> In classical literature, the city was sometimes referred to as the [[City of the Violet Crown]], first documented in Pindar's ἰοστέφανοι Ἀθᾶναι (''iostéphanoi Athânai''), or as {{lang|grc|τὸ κλεινὸν ἄστυ}} (''tò kleinòn ásty'', "the glorious city").

During the medieval period, the name of the city was rendered once again in the singular as {{lang|el|Ἀθήνα}}. Variant names included Setines, Satine, and Astines, all derivations involving [[false splitting]] of prepositional phrases.<ref name="Bourne1887">{{Cite journal |last=Bourne, Edward G. |year=1887 |title=The Derivation of Stamboul |journal=American Journal of Philology |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=78–82 |doi=10.2307/287478 |jstor=287478| issn=0002-9475 }}</ref> King [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alphonse X of Castile]] gives the pseudo-etymology 'the one without death/ignorance'.<ref>'General Storia' (Global History)</ref>{{page needed|date=November 2020}} In Ottoman Turkish, it was called {{Script|Arab|آتينا}} ''Ātīnā'',<ref>''Osmanlı Yer Adları'', Ankara 2017, ''s.v.''

By the sixth century BC, widespread social unrest led to the reforms of [[Solon]]. These would pave the way for the eventual introduction of democracy by [[Cleisthenes]] in 508&nbsp;BC. Athens had by this time become a significant naval power with a large fleet, and helped the [[Ionian Revolt|rebellion of the Ionian cities]] against [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] rule. In the ensuing [[Greco-Persian Wars]] Athens, together with Sparta, led the coalition of Greek states that would eventually repel the Persians, defeating them decisively at [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]] in 490&nbsp;BC, and crucially at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] in 480&nbsp;BC. However, this did not prevent Athens from being [[Achaemenid destruction of Athens|captured and sacked twice]] by the Persians within one year, after a heroic but ultimately failed resistance at [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] by [[Sparta]]ns and other Greeks led by [[Leonidas I|King Leonidas]],<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lewis |first=John David |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BHe0KeXyL_AC&pg=PA34 |title=Nothing Less than Victory: Decisive Wars and the Lessons of History |date=25 January 2010 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-1400834303 |access-date=24 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200312034708/https://books.google.com/books?id=BHe0KeXyL_AC&pg=PA34 |archive-date=12 March 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> after both [[Boeotia]] and [[Attica]] fell to the Persians.

The decades that followed became known as the [[Fifth-century Athens|Golden Age of Athenian democracy]], during which time Athens became the leading city of [[Ancient Greece]], with its cultural achievements laying the foundations for [[western culture|Western civilization]].<ref name=britannica /><ref name= bbc /> The playwrights [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] flourished in Athens during this time, as did the historians [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]], the physician [[Hippocrates]], and the philosopher [[Socrates]]. Guided by [[Pericles]], who promoted the arts and fostered democracy, Athens embarked on an ambitious building program that saw the construction of the Acropolis of Athens (including the [[Parthenon]]), as well as empire-building via the [[Delian League]]. Originally intended as an association of [[Greek city-state]]s to continue the fight against the Persians, the league soon turned into a vehicle for Athens's own imperial ambitions. The resulting tensions brought about the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431–404&nbsp;BC), in which Athens was defeated by its rival Sparta.<ref>[[Xenophon]], ''[[Hellenica]]'', 2.2.20, 404/3</ref>

[[File:The_Parthenon_in_Athens.jpg|thumb|The [[Parthenon]] on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] hill in Athens]]
By the mid-4th century BC, the northern Greek kingdom of [[Macedon]] was becoming dominant in Athenian affairs. In 338&nbsp;BC the armies of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] defeated an alliance of some of the Greek city-states including Athens and Thebes at the Battle of Chaeronea. Later, under Rome, Athens was given the status of a [[free city (classical antiquity)|free city]] because of its widely admired schools. In the second century AD, the Roman emperor Hadrian, himself an Athenian citizen,<ref>Kouremenos, Anna (2022). "'The City of Hadrian and not of Theseus': A Cultural History of Hadrian's Arch". In A. Kouremenos (ed.) ''The Province of Achaea in the 2nd century CE: The Past Present''.

In the early 4th century AD, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] began to be governed from [[Constantinople]], and with the construction and expansion of the imperial city, many of Athens's works of art were taken by the emperors to adorn it. The Empire became Christianized, and the use of [[Latin]] declined in favour of exclusive use of [[Medieval Greek|Greek]]; in the [[Roman imperial period (chronology)|Roman imperial period]], both languages had been used. In the later Roman period, Athens was ruled by the emperors continuing until the 13th century, its citizens identifying themselves as citizens of the Roman Empire ("''[[Rhomaioi]]''"). The conversion of the empire from paganism to Christianity greatly affected Athens, resulting in reduced reverence for the city.<ref name=tung/> Ancient monuments such as the Parthenon, Erechtheion and the Hephaisteion (Theseion) were converted into churches. As the empire became increasingly anti-pagan, Athens became a provincial town and experienced fluctuating fortunes.

The city remained an important center of learning, especially of [[Neoplatonism]]—with notable pupils including [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], [[Basil of Caesarea]] and emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] ({{Reign|355|363}})—and consequently a center of paganism.

Athens was sacked by the [[Slavs]] in 582, but remained in imperial hands thereafter, as highlighted by the visit of the emperor [[Constans II]] ({{Reign|641|668}}) in 662/3 and its inclusion in the [[Theme of Hellas]].<ref name="ODB"/>

The city was threatened by [[Saracen]] raids in the 8th–9th centuries—in 896, Athens was raided and possibly occupied for a short period, an event which left some archaeological remains and elements of Arabic ornamentation in contemporary buildings<ref name="EI2">{{cite encyclopedia | article = Atīna | first = Franz | last = Babinger | author-link = Franz Babinger | encyclopedia = The Encyclopedia of Islam, New Edition, Volume I: A–B | publisher = BRILL | location = Leiden and New York | year = 1986 | isbn = 90-04-08114-3 | pages = 738–739 | url = http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/atina-SIM_0849 }}</ref>—but there is also evidence of a mosque existing in the city at the time.<ref name="ODB" /> In the great dispute over [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]], Athens is commonly held to have supported the [[iconophile]] position, chiefly due to the role played by Empress [[Irene of Athens]] in the ending of the first period of Iconoclasm at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787.<ref name="ODB" /> A few years later, another Athenian, [[Theophano of Athens|Theophano]], became empress as the wife of [[Staurakios]] (r. 811–812).<ref name="ODB" />

Invasion of the empire by the Turks after the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, and the ensuing civil wars, largely passed the region by and Athens continued its provincial existence unharmed. When the Byzantine Empire was rescued by the resolute leadership of the three [[Komnenos]] emperors [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios]], [[John II Komnenos|John]] and [[Manuel I Komnenos|Manuel]], Attica and the rest of Greece prospered. Archaeological evidence tells us that the medieval town experienced a period of rapid and sustained growth, starting in the 11th century and continuing until the end of the 12th century.
[[File:Acropolis_Frankish_tower.jpg|thumb|Photograph of the [[Frankish Tower (Acropolis of Athens)|Frankish Tower of the Acropolis of Athens]] in 1874, with the ruins of the [[Propylaea (Acropolis of Athens)|Propylaea]] and view west over the Athenian plain towards [[Mount Aigaleo]] before it demolished in 1875]]

The [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]] (marketplace) had been deserted since late antiquity, began to be built over, and soon the town became an important centre for the production of soaps and dyes. The growth of the town attracted the [[Venice|Venetians]], and various other traders who frequented the ports of the Aegean, to Athens. This interest in trade appears to have further increased the economic prosperity of the town.

The 11th and 12th centuries were the Golden Age of [[Byzantine art]] in Athens. Almost all of the most important Middle Byzantine churches in and around Athens were built during these two centuries, and this reflects the growth of the town in general. However, this medieval prosperity was not to last. In 1204, the [[Fourth Crusade]] conquered Athens and the city was not recovered from the [[Roman Catholicism|Latins]] before it was taken by the [[Ottoman Turks]]. It did not become Greek in government again until the 19th century.

From 1204 until 1458, Athens was ruled by Latins in three separate periods, following the [[Crusades]]. The "Latins", or "[[Franks (Crusaders)|Franks]]", were western Europeans and followers of the [[Latin Church]] brought to the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] during the Crusades. Along with rest of Byzantine Greece, Athens was part of the series of feudal [[fiefs]], similar to the  [[Crusader states]] established in [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and on [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus]] after the [[First Crusade]]. This period is known as the ''[[Frankokratia]]''.

The first [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] attack on Athens, which involved a short-lived occupation of the town, came in 1397, under the Ottoman generals [[Yaqub Pasha]] and Timurtash.<ref name="EI2"/> Finally, in 1458, Athens was captured by the Ottomans under the personal leadership of Sultan [[Mehmed II]].<ref name="EI2"/> As the Ottoman Sultan rode into the city, he was greatly struck by the beauty of its ancient monuments and issued a ''[[firman]]'' (imperial edict) forbidding their looting or destruction, on pain of death. The [[Parthenon]] was converted into the [[Parthenon mosque|main mosque]] of the city.<ref name=tung/>

Under Ottoman rule, Athens was denuded of any importance and its population severely declined, leaving it as a "small country town" ([[Franz Babinger]]).<ref name="EI2"/> From the early 17th century, Athens came under the jurisdiction of the [[Kizlar Agha]], the chief black eunuch of the [[Imperial Harem|Sultan's harem]]. The city had originally been granted by Sultan [[Ahmed I]] ({{reign|1603|1617}}) to Basilica, one of his favourite concubines, who hailed from the city, in response of complaints of maladministration by the local governors. After her death, Athens came under the purview of the Kizlar Agha.<ref>{{cite book |last = Augustinos |first = Olga |chapter = Eastern Concubines, Western Mistresses: Prévost's ''Histoire d'une Grecque moderne'' |page=24 |editor1-last = Buturović |editor1-first = Amila |editor2-last = Schick |editor2-first = İrvin Cemil |title = Women in the Ottoman Balkans: Gender, Culture and History |year = 2007 |publisher = I.B.

The Turks began a practice of storing gunpowder and explosives in the Parthenon and [[Propylaea (Acropolis of Athens)|Propylaea]].

A shot fired during the bombardment of the Acropolis caused a powder magazine in the Parthenon to explode (26 September), and the building was severely damaged, giving it largely the appearance it has today. The Venetian occupation of Athens lasted for six months, and both the Venetians and the Ottomans participated in the looting of the Parthenon. One of its western pediments was removed, causing even more damage to the structure.<ref name=tung/><ref name="EI2"/> During the Venetian occupation, the two mosques of the city were converted into Catholic and Protestant churches, but on 9 April 1688 the Venetians abandoned Athens again to the Ottomans.<ref name="EI2"/>

=== Modern history ===
{{Main|Greek War of Independence|Kingdom of Greece|Republic of Greece}}
[[File:Peter v Hess Empfang König Otto (1).jpg|thumb|''The Entry of [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]] in Athens'', [[Peter von Hess]], 1839]]

In 1822, a Greek insurgency captured the city, but it fell to the Ottomans again in 1826 (though Acropolis held till June 1827). Again the ancient monuments suffered badly. The Ottoman forces remained in possession until March 1833, when they withdrew.

Following the [[Greek War of Independence]] and the establishment of the [[Greek Kingdom]], Athens was chosen to replace [[Nafplio]] as the second capital of the newly independent Greek state in 1834, largely because of historical and sentimental reasons.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vb2xAAAAIAAJ&q=otto+move+capital+athens |title=Planning and Urban Growth in Southern Europe |last=Wynn |first=Martin |year=1984 |publisher=Mansell |isbn=978-0720116083 |page=6 |language=en}}</ref> At the time, after the extensive destruction it had suffered during the war of independence, it was reduced to a town of about 4,000 people (less than half its earlier population) in a loose swarm of houses along the foot of the Acropolis. The first [[King of Greece]], [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]] of Bavaria, commissioned the architects [[Stamatios Kleanthis]] and [[Eduard Schaubert]] to design a modern city plan fit for the capital of a state.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}
[[File:Olympic flame at opening ceremony.jpg|thumb|The [[Olympic Flame]] at the [[2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] of the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]]]

The first modern city plan consisted of a triangle defined by the Acropolis, the ancient cemetery of [[Kerameikos]] and the new palace of the Bavarian king (now housing the [[Greek Parliament]]), so as to highlight the continuity between modern and ancient Athens. Neoclassicism, the international style of this epoch, was the architectural style through which Bavarian, French and Greek architects such as Hansen, Klenze, Boulanger or Kaftantzoglou designed the first important public buildings of the new capital.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}} In 1896, Athens hosted the first modern [[Olympic Games]]. During the 1920s a number of [[Greek refugees]], expelled from [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] after the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]] and [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], swelled Athens's population; nevertheless it was most particularly following [[World War II]], and from the 1950s and 1960s, that the population of the city exploded,{{citation needed|date=January 2023}} and Athens experienced a gradual expansion.

In the 1980s, it became evident that smog from factories and an ever-increasing fleet of automobiles, as well as a lack of adequate free space due to congestion, had evolved into the city's most important challenge.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}} A series of anti-pollution measures taken by the city's authorities in the 1990s, combined with a substantial improvement of the city's infrastructure (including the [[Attiki Odos]] motorway, the expansion of the [[Athens Metro]], and the new [[Athens International Airport]]), considerably alleviated pollution and transformed Athens into a much more functional city. In 2004, Athens hosted the [[2004 Summer Olympics]].

Athens sprawls across the central plain of Attica that is often referred to as the '''Athens Basin''' or the '''Attica Basin''' ({{langx|el|Λεκανοπέδιο Αθηνών/Αττικής|translit=Lekanopédio Athinón/Attikís}}).

Athens is built around a large number of hills. [[Mount Lycabettus|Lycabettus]] is one of the tallest hills of the city proper and provides a view of the entire Attica Basin. The meteorology of Athens is deemed to be one of the most complex in the world because its mountains cause a [[inversion (meteorology)|temperature inversion]] phenomenon which, along with the Greek government's difficulties controlling industrial pollution, was responsible for the air pollution problems the city has faced.<ref name=tung/> This issue is not unique to Athens; for instance, Los Angeles and [[Mexico City]] also suffer from similar atmospheric inversion problems.<ref name="tung">{{Cite book |last=Tung |first=Anthony |title=Preserving the World's Great Cities: The Destruction and Renewal of the Historic Metropolis |publisher=Three Rivers Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-609-80815-X |location=New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/preservingworlds00anth/page/266 266] |chapter=The City the Gods Besieged |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/preservingworlds00anth |chapter-url-access=registration}}</ref>

[[Parnitha]] National Park is punctuated by well-marked paths, gorges, springs, torrents and caves dotting the protected area. Hiking and mountain-biking in all four mountains are popular outdoor activities for residents of the city. The [[National Garden of Athens]] was completed in 1840 and is a green refuge of 15.5 hectares in the centre of the Greek capital. It is to be found between the Parliament and [[Zappeion]] buildings, the latter of which maintains its own garden of seven hectares.

===Climate===

[[File:Athens_and_Mount_Lycabettus_from_the_Areopagus_on_July_22,_2019.jpg|thumb|Sunrise in Athens]]
Athens has a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Csa''). The climate in Athens can be considered warmer than some cities that are similar or even less distant from the equator such as Seoul, Melbourne, Buenos Aires, Cape Town and Norfolk (Virgina, US). According to the meteorological station near the city center which is operated by the [[National Observatory of Athens]], the downtown area has simple mean annual temperature of {{convert|19.2|C|F}} while parts of the urban agglomeration may reach up to {{convert|19.8|C|F}}, being affected by the [[urban heat island]] effect.<ref name="Climate Atlas of Greece">{{Cite web |title=Climate Atlas of Greece |url=http://climatlas.hnms.gr/sdi/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220204171218/http://climatlas.hnms.gr/sdi/ |archive-date=4 February 2022 |access-date=10 April 2022 |publisher=[[Hellenic National Meteorological Service]]}}</ref> Athens receives about {{convert|433.1|mm|in}} of precipitation per year, largely concentrated during the colder half of the year with the remaining rainfall falling sparsely, mainly during thunderstorms.

The southern section of the [[Athens metropolitan area]] (i.e., [[Elliniko]], [[Athens Riviera]]) lies in the transitional zone between [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] (''Csa'') and hot [[semi-arid climate]] (''BSh''), with its port-city of [[Piraeus]] being the most extreme example, receiving just {{convert|331.9|mm|in}} per year.

Athens became the capital of Greece in 1834, following [[Nafplion]], which was the provisional capital from 1829. The municipality (city) of Athens is also the capital of the [[Attica (region)|Attica]] region. The term ''Athens'' can refer either to the municipality of Athens, to Greater Athens or urban area, or to the entire Athens Metropolitan Area.

The large '''city centre'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> ({{langx|el|Κέντρο της Αθήνας|translit=Kéntro tis Athínas}}) of the Greek capital falls directly within the '''Municipality of Athens'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> ({{langx|el|Δήμος Αθηναίων|translit=Dímos Athinaíon}}), which is the largest in population size in Greece and forms the core of the Athens urban area, followed by the '''Municipality of [[Piraeus]]''', which forms a significant city centre on its own within the Athens urban area and it is the second largest in population size within it.

[[File:Public transport map of Athens.png|thumb|Athens railways network (Metro, Suburban Railway and Tram)]]

Athens is the country's major transportation hub. The city has Greece's largest airport and its largest port; Piraeus, too, is the largest container transport port in the Mediterranean, and the largest passenger port in Europe.

Athens is a major national hub for Intercity ([[KTEL (Greece)|Ktel]]) and international buses, as well as for domestic and international rail transport. Public transport is serviced by a variety of transportation means, making up the country's largest mass transit system. [[Transport for Athens]] operates a large bus and [[trolleybus]] fleet, the city's [[Athens Metro|Metro]], a [[Athens Suburban Railway|Suburban Railway]] service<ref>{{Cite web |title=Suburban Railway |url=https://www.trainose.gr/en/passenger-activity/suburban-railway/ |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210418013949/https://www.trainose.gr/en/passenger-activity/suburban-railway/ |archive-date=18 April 2021 |access-date=28 March 2021 |website=[[TrainOSE]]}}</ref> and a [[Athens Tram|tram network]], connecting the southern suburbs to the city centre.<ref>{{Cite web |title= The tram of Athens  |url=http://www.tramsa.gr/index.cfm?page_id=192&category=learn&lang_id=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114071740/http://www.tramsa.gr/index.cfm?page_id=192&category=learn&lang_id=1 |archive-date=14 January 2009 |access-date=5 January 2009 |publisher=Tram Sa }}</ref>

=== Bus transport ===
OSY ({{langx|el|ΟΣΥ}}) (Odikes Sygkoinonies S.A.), a subsidiary company of OASA (Athens urban transport organisation), is the main operator of buses and trolleybuses in Athens. As of 2017, its network consists of around 322 bus lines, spanning the Athens Metropolitan Area, and making up a fleet of 2,375 buses and trolleybuses. Of those 2,375, 619 buses run on [[compressed natural gas]], making up the largest fleet of natural gas-powered buses in Europe, and 354 are electric-powered (trolleybuses). All of the 354 trolleybuses are equipped to run on diesel in case of [[Power outage|power failure]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Στόλος λεωφορείων |url=https://www.osy.gr/ethelsite/pages/allBuses.php |website=Ο.ΣΥ.

International links are provided by a number of private companies. National and regional bus links are provided by [[KTEL (Greece)|KTEL]] from two InterCity Bus Terminals; [[Athens Peloponnese Bus Station|Kifissos Bus Terminal]] A and [[Athens Liosion Bus Station|Liosion Bus Terminal]] B, both located in the north-western part of the city. ''Kifissos'' provides connections towards [[Peloponnese]], North Greece, West Greece and some [[Ionian Islands]], whereas ''Liosion'' is used for most of Central Greece. Both of these terminals will be replaced by a new Intercity Bus Terminal under construction in [[Elaionas|Eleonas]] due to be completed by 2027.

=== Motorways ===
{{Further|National Roads and Motorways in Greece}}
[[File:Athens-Kiffisia-aerial.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of an [[A6 motorway (Greece)|A6]] interchange north of Athens]]

Two main motorways of Greece begin in Athens, namely the [[A1 motorway (Greece)|A1]]/[[European route E75|E75]], heading north towards Greece's second largest city, [[Thessaloniki]]; and the border crossing of Evzones and the [[A8 motorway (Greece)|A8]]/[[European route E94|E94]] heading west, towards Greece's third largest city, [[Patras]], which incorporated the [[Greek National Road 8A|GR-8A]]. Before their completion much of the road traffic used the [[Greek National Road 1|GR-1]] and the [[Greek National Road 8|GR-8]].

Athens' Metropolitan Area is served by the [[Attiki Odos]] toll motorway network: its main section, the [[A6 motorway (Greece)|A6]], extends from the western industrial suburb of [[Eleusina|Elefsina]] to [[Athens International Airport]]; while two beltways, namely the Aigaleo Beltway ([[A65 motorway (Greece)|A65]]) and the Hymettus Beltway ([[A62 motorway (Greece)|A62]]) serve parts of western and eastern Athens respectively.

Located on [[Panepistimiou Street]], the old campus of the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|University of Athens]], the [[National Library of Greece|National Library]], and the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Athens Academy]] form the "Athens Trilogy" built in the mid-19th century. The largest and oldest university in Athens is the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. Most of the functions of NKUA along National Technical University of Athens have been transferred to a campus in the eastern suburb of [[Zografou]]. The [[National Technical University of Athens]] old campus is located on Patision Street.

The [[University of West Attica]] is the second largest university in Athens. The seat of the university is located in the western area of Athens, where the philosophers of Ancient Athens delivered lectures. All the activities of UNIWA are carried out in the modern infrastructure of the three University Campuses within the metropolitan region of Athens (Egaleo Park, Ancient Olive Groove and Athens), which offer modern teaching and research spaces, entertainment and support facilities for all students. Other universities that lie within Athens are the [[Athens University of Economics and Business]], the [[Panteion University]], the [[Agricultural University of Athens]] and the [[University of Piraeus]].

There are overall ten state-supported Institutions of Higher (or Tertiary) education located in the Athens Urban Area, these are by chronological order: [[Athens School of Fine Arts]] (1837), [[National Technical University of Athens]] (1837), [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens]] (1837), [[Agricultural University of Athens]] (1920), [[Athens University of Economics and Business]] (1920), [[Panteion University|Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences]] (1927), [[University of Piraeus]] (1938), [[Harokopio University|Harokopio University of Athens]] (1990), [[School of Pedagogical and Technological Education]] (2002), [[University of West Attica]] (2018). There are also several other private ''colleges'', as they called formally in Greece, as the establishment of private universities is prohibited by the constitution. Many of them are accredited by a foreign state or university such as the [[American College of Greece]] and the [[University of Indianapolis – Athens Campus|Athens Campus]] of the [[University of Indianapolis]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ιδιωτικά Πανεπιστήμια στην Ελλάδα – Private Universities in Greece |url=http://www.thought.de/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625234055/http://www.thought.de/ |archive-date=25 June 2012 |access-date=12 June 2012 |website=www.thought.de}}</ref>

The city is a world centre of [[archaeology|archaeological research]]. Alongside national academic institutions, such as the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|Athens University]] and the [[Archaeological Society of Athens|Archaeological Society]], it is home to multiple archaeological museums, taking in the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]], the [[Goulandris Museum of Cycladic Art|Cycladic Museum]], the [[Epigraphy|Epigraphic]] Museum, the [[Byzantine & Christian Museum]], as well as museums at the ancient Agora, [[Acropolis Museum|Acropolis]], [[Kerameikos]], and the [[Kerameikos Archaeological Museum]]. The city is also the setting for the [[Democritus|Demokritos]] laboratory for [[Archaeological science|Archaeometry]], alongside regional and national archaeological authorities forming part of the [[Minister for Culture (Greece)|Greek Department of Culture]].

Athens hosts 17 [[List of Foreign Archaeological Institutes in Greece|Foreign Archaeological Institutes]] which promote and facilitate research by scholars from their home countries. As a result, Athens has more than a dozen archaeological libraries and three specialized archaeological laboratories, and is the venue of several hundred specialized lectures, conferences and seminars, as well as dozens of archaeological exhibitions each year. At any given time, hundreds of international scholars and researchers in all disciplines of archaeology are to be found in the city.

Athens' most important museums include:
* the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]], the largest archaeological museum in the country, and one of the most important internationally, as it contains a vast collection of antiquities. Its artefacts cover a period of more than 5,000 years, from late [[Neolithic]] Age to [[Roman Greece]];
* the [[Benaki Museum]] with its several branches for each of its collections including ancient, Byzantine, Ottoman-era, Chinese art and beyond;
* the [[Byzantine & Christian Museum|Byzantine and Christian Museum]], one of the most important museums of [[Byzantine art]];
* the [[National Gallery (Athens)|National Art Gallery]], the nation's eponymous leading gallery, which reopened in 2021 after renovation;
* the [[Athens National Museum of Contemporary Art|National Museum of Contemporary Art]], which opened in 2000 in a former brewery building;

* the [[Acropolis Museum|New Acropolis Museum]], opened in 2009, and replacing the old museum on the Acropolis. The new museum has proved considerably popular; almost one million people visited during the summer period June–October 2009 alone. A number of smaller and privately owned museums focused on Greek culture and arts are also to be found.
* the [[Kerameikos Archaeological Museum]], a museum which displays artifacts from the burial site of Kerameikos. Much of the pottery and other artifacts relate to Athenian attitudes towards death and the afterlife, throughout many ages.
* the [[Jewish Museum of Greece]], a museum which describes the history and culture of [[History of the Jews in Greece|the Greek Jewish community]].

=== Architecture ===

Athens incorporates [[architectural style]]s ranging from [[Greek Revival architecture|Greco-Roman]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] to Modern. They are often to be found in the same areas, as Athens is not marked by a uniformity of architectural style. A visitor will quickly notice the absence of tall buildings: Athens has very strict [[height restriction laws]] in order to ensure the Acropolis Hill is visible throughout the city. Despite the variety in styles, there is evidence of continuity in elements of the architectural environment throughout the city's history.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Doumas |first=Christos |title=1998 Excavation and rescue operations: what to preserve and why |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-0033.00142|publisher=UNESCO |doi=10.1111/1468-0033.00142 |access-date=4 July 2022 |journal=Museum International|date=April 1998 |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=6–9 }}</ref>

For the greatest part of the 19th century Neoclassicism dominated Athens, as well as some deviations from it such as [[Eclecticism]], especially in the early 20th century. Thus, the [[Old Royal Palace]] was the first important public building to be built, between 1836 and 1843. Later in the mid and late 19th century, [[Baron Theophil von Hansen|Theophil Freiherr von Hansen]] and [[Ernst Ziller]] took part in the construction of many neoclassical buildings such as the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Athens Academy]] and the [[Zappeion]] Hall. Ziller also designed many private mansions in the centre of Athens which gradually became public, usually through donations, such as [[Heinrich Schliemann|Schliemann]]'s [[Iliou Melathron]].

Beginning in the 1920s, [[modern architecture]] including [[Bauhaus]] and [[Art Deco]] began to exert an influence on almost all Greek architects, and buildings both public and private were constructed in accordance with these styles. Localities with a great number of such buildings include [[Kolonaki]], and some areas of the centre of the city; neighbourhoods developed in this period include [[Kypseli, Athens|Kypseli]].<ref>[[Helen Fessas-Emmanouil|Fessas-Emmanouil, Helen]].

In the 1950s and 1960s during the extension and development of Athens, other modern movements such as the [[International Style (architecture)|International style]] played an important role. The centre of Athens was largely rebuilt, leading to the demolition of a number of neoclassical buildings. The architects of this era employed materials such as glass, marble and aluminium, and many blended modern and classical elements.<ref>[[Helen Fessas-Emmanouil|Fessas-Emmanouil, Helen]]. ''Ελληνική Αρχιτεκτονική Εταιρεία: Αρχιτέκτονες του 20ού αιώνα: Μέλη της Εταιρείας'', Ποταμός, Athens, 2009, p. XXXI, {{ISBN|960-6691-38-1}}</ref> After World War II, internationally known architects to have designed and built in the city included [[Walter Gropius]], with his design for the US Embassy, and, among others, [[Eero Saarinen]], in his postwar design for the east terminal of the [[Ellinikon International Airport|Ellinikon Airport]].

Across the city numerous statues or busts are to be found. Apart from the neoclassicals by [[Leonidas Drosis]] at the Academy of Athens (Plato, Socrates, Apollo and Athena), others in notable categories include the statue of [[Theseus]] by [[Georgios Fytalis]] at Thiseion; depictions of philhellenes such as [[Lord Byron]], [[George Canning]], and [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]]; the equestrian statue of [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]] by [[Lazaros Sochos]] in front of the Old Parliament; statues of [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], [[Rigas Feraios]] and [[Adamantios Korais]] at the university; of [[Evangelos Zappas]] and [[Konstantinos Zappas]] at the Zappeion; [[Ioannis Varvakis]] at the National Garden; the" Woodbreaker" by [[Dimitrios Filippotis]]; the equestrian statue of [[Alexandros Papagos]] in the Papagou district; and various busts of fighters of Greek independence at the [[Pedion tou Areos]]. A significant landmark is also the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Syntagma.

The most successful songs during the period 1870–1930 were the Athenian serenades (Αθηναϊκές καντάδες), based on the [[Heptanese]]an [[Greek folk music#Ionian Islands|kantádhes]] (καντάδες '[[serenade]]s'; sing.: καντάδα) and the songs performed on stage (επιθεωρησιακά τραγούδια 'theatrical revue songs') in [[revues]], [[Musical theatre|musical comedies]], [[operettas]] and [[nocturnes]] that were dominating Athens' theatre scene.

In 1922, following the war, genocide and later population exchange suffered by the Greek population of Asia Minor, many ethnic Greeks fled to Athens. They settled in poor neighbourhoods and brought with them [[Rebetiko]] music, making it also popular in Greece, and which later became the base for the [[Laïko]] music. Other forms of song popular today in Greece are elafrolaika, entechno, dimotika, and skyladika.<ref name="Tales of Orpheus">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fT5TAQAAQBAJ |title=Athens – The Truth: Searching for Mános, Just Before the Bubble Burst |date=1 September 2013 |publisher=Tales of Orpheus |isbn=9780955209031 |access-date=24 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210205131700/https://books.google.com/books?id=fT5TAQAAQBAJ |archive-date=5 February 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> Greece's most notable, and internationally famous, composers of Greek song, mainly of the entechno form, are [[Manos Hadjidakis]] and [[Mikis Theodorakis]].

Athens has a long tradition in sports and sporting events, serving as home to the most important clubs in [[Sport in Greece|Greek sport]] and housing a large number of sports facilities. The city has also been host to sports events of international importance.

Athens has hosted the [[Summer Olympic Games]] twice, in [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]] and [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]]. The 2004 Summer Olympics required the development of the [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)|Athens Olympic Stadium]], which has since gained a reputation as one of the most beautiful stadiums in the world, and one of its most interesting modern monuments.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Athens 21st Century – Athens Olympic Stadium |url=http://www.athens-today.com/e-olimpica_stadio.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216232456/http://www.athens-today.com/e-olimpica_stadio.htm |archive-date=16 February 2009 |access-date=26 December 2008 |publisher=Athens-today.com}}</ref> The biggest stadium in the country, it hosted two finals of the [[UEFA Champions League]], in [[1994 UEFA Champions League Final|1994]] and [[2007 UEFA Champions League Final|2007]].

Events in other sports such as [[Track and field athletics|athletics]], volleyball, [[water polo]] etc., have been hosted in the capital's venues.

Athens is home to three European multi-sport clubs: [[Panathinaikos A.O.|Panathinaikos]], originated in Athens city centre, [[Olympiacos CFP|Olympiacos]], originated in the nearby port city of [[Piraeus]] and [[Athletic Union of Constantinople|AEK Athens]], originated in the suburb of [[Nea Filadelfeia]]. In [[association football|football]], [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] made it to the [[1971 European Cup Final]], [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] have dominated domestic competitions, while [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] is the other member of the [[P.O.K.|big three]]. These clubs also have basketball teams; [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]] and [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]] are among the top powers in European basketball, having won the [[Euroleague Basketball|Euroleague]] seven times and three respectively, whilst [[AEK Athens B.C.|AEK Athens]] was the first Greek team to win a European trophy in any team sport.

The Athens area encompasses a variety of [[terrain]], notably hills and mountains rising around the city, and the capital is the only major city in Europe to be bisected by a [[mountain range]]. Four mountain ranges extend into city boundaries and thousands of kilometres of trails criss-cross the city and neighbouring areas, providing exercise and wilderness access on [[hiking|foot]] and [[Mountain biking|bike]].

Beyond Athens and across the prefecture of Attica, outdoor activities include [[skiing]], [[rock climbing]], [[hang gliding]] and windsurfing. Numerous outdoor clubs serve these sports, including the Athens Chapter of the [[Sierra Club]], which leads over 4,000 outings annually in the area.

Athens was awarded the 2004 Summer Olympics on 5 September 1997 in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, after having lost a previous bid to host the [[1996 Summer Olympics]], to [[Atlanta]], United States.<ref name=oly/> It was to be the second time Athens would host the games, following the inaugural event of 1896. After an unsuccessful bid in 1990, the 1997 bid was radically improved, including an appeal to Greece's Olympic history. In the last round of voting, Athens defeated Rome with 66 votes to 41.<ref name=oly/> Prior to this round, the cities of [[Buenos Aires]], Stockholm and [[Cape Town]] had been eliminated from competition, having received fewer votes.<ref name=oly/> Although the heavy cost was criticized, estimated at $1.5&nbsp;billion, Athens was transformed into a more functional city that enjoys modern technology both in transportation and in modern [[urban planning|urban development]].<ref name="olyy">{{Cite news |date=30 August 2004 |title=Athens bids farewell to the Games |work=CNN |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SPORT/08/29/closing.ceremony/ |url-status=live |access-date=29 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115082941/http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SPORT/08/29/closing.ceremony/ |archive-date=15 January 2008}}</ref> The games welcomed over 10,000 athletes from all 202 countries.<ref name=olyy/>
