===Prehistory===

[[File:Kermanshah-London illustrated news 1.jpg|thumb|left|220px|A view of Kermanshah in mid.-19th century- toward south, Farokhshad Mt. and Wasi Mt. are visible at background]]

Because of its antiquity, attractive landscapes, rich culture and [[Neolithic]] villages, Kermanshah is considered one of the [[Cradle of civilization|cradles]] of [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] cultures. According to archaeological surveys and excavation, the Kermanshah area has been occupied by prehistoric people since the [[Lower Paleolithic]] period, and continued to later [[Paleolithic]] periods till late [[Pleistocene]] period. The Lower Paleolithic evidence consists of some [[hand axe]]s found in the Gakia area to the east of the city. The [[Middle Paleolithic]] remains have been found in various parts of the province, especially in the northern vicinity of the city in Tang-e Kenesht, [[Malaverd|Tang-e Malaverd]] and near [[Taq-e Bostan]].
 
[[Neanderthal]] Man existed in the Kermanshah region during this period and the only discovered skeletal remains of this early human in Iran was found in three caves and [[rock shelter]] situated in Kermanshah province.<ref>{{cite web |title=New study sheds light on second Neanderthal tooth found in western iran |url=https://s18.picofile.com/file/8440107476/Tehran_Times_Aug_2021_Yawan_Neanderthal.pdf.html |website=Tehran Times - 29 August 2021 |publisher=Tehran Times |access-date=5 November 2021}}</ref> The known Paleolithic caves in this area are [[Warwasi]], [[Qosbeh-ye Maniat|Qobeh]], [[Malaverd]] and [[Do-Ashkaft Cave]]. The region was also one of the first places in which human settlements including [[Asiab, Omidiyeh|Asiab]], [[Qazanchi]], Sarab, [[Chia Jani]], and [[Ganj-Darreh]] were established between 8,000 and 10,000 years ago.

This is about the same time that the first [[Pottery|potteries]] pertaining to Iran were made in [[Ganj Dareh|Ganj-Darreh]], near present-day [[Harsin]]. In May 2009, based on a research conducted by the university of [[Hamadan]] and [[University College London|UCL]], the head of Archeology Research Center of [[Ministry of Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism|Iran's Cultural Heritage and Tourism Organization]] announced that one of the oldest [[prehistoric]] village in the [[Middle East]] dating back to 9800 B.P. was discovered in [[Sahneh County|Sahneh]], located west of Kermanshah.<ref name="ISNA">{{cite web

Remains of later village occupations and early [[Bronze Age]] are found in a number of mound sites in the city itself.

The city contains 4 archaeological mound sites: Chogha Kaboud, [[Chogha Golan]], Morad Hasel, and [[Tappa Gawri]].

===Sassanid Kermanshah===

[[File:Bistoon Kermanshah.jpg|thumb|220px|Hellenistic-era depiction of [[Verethragna|Bahram]] as [[Hercules]] carved in 153 BC]]

In ancient [[Iranian folklore|Iranian]] [[myth]]ology, construction of the city is attributed to [[Tahmuras]], the third king of [[Pishdadian]] dynasty. It is believed that the [[Sassanids]] have constructed Kermanshah and [[Bahram IV]] (he was called Kermanshah, meaning king of [[Kerman]]) gave his name to this city.<ref>[http://www.loghatnaameh.com/dehkhodaworddetail-3dad73773a1c4e78844374111c1a94fb-fa.html Dehkhoda: Kermanshah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511180623/http://www.loghatnaameh.com/dehkhodaworddetail-3dad73773a1c4e78844374111c1a94fb-fa.html |date=2011-05-11 }}.</ref>

It was a glorious city in [[Sassanid]] period about the 4th century AD when it became the capital city of [[Persian Empire]] and a significant [[Community health center|health center]] serving as the summer resort for [[Sassanid]] kings. In AD 226, following a two-year war led by the Persian Emperor, [[Ardashir I]], against "[[Kurdish population|Kurdish]]" tribes in the region, the empire reinstated a local "Kurdish" prince, [[Kayus]] of Medya, to rule Kermanshah.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} At the time, the term "[[Kurds|Kurd]]" was used as a social term, designating Iranian [[nomad]]s, rather than a concrete ethnic group.<ref>J.

Wiesbaden: Dr. Ludwich Reichert, 1989, pp. 613–21. excerpt: "The ethnic label "Kurd" is first encountered in Arabic sources from the first centuries of the Islamic era; it seemed to refer to a specific variety of pastoral nomadism, and possibly to a set of political units, rather than to a linguistic group: once or twice, "Arabic Kurds" are mentioned. By the 10th century, the term appears to denote nomadic and/or transhumant groups speaking an Iranian language and mainly inhabiting the mountainous areas to the South of Lake Van and Lake Urmia, with some offshoots in the Caucasus. ... If there was a Kurdish-speaking subjected peasantry at that time, the term was not yet used to include them."[http://www.let.uu.nl/~Martin.vanBruinessen/personal/publications/Bruinessen_Ethnic_identity_Kurds.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015152331/http://www.let.uu.nl/~Martin.vanBruinessen/personal/publications/Bruinessen_Ethnic_identity_Kurds.pdf|date=2015-10-15}}</ref> Within the dynasty known as the [[House of Kayus]] (also ''Kâvusakân'') remained a semi-independent kingdom lasting until AD 380 before [[Ardashir II]] removed the dynasty's last ruling member.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

===Islamic era===

Kermanshah was conquered by the [[Arabs]] in 629 AD. Under [[Seljuks|Seljuk]] rule in the eleventh century, it became the major cultural and commercial center in western [[Iran]] and the southern [[Kurds|Kurdish]]-inhabited areas as a whole. It was sacked by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] under [[Hulegu Khan|Hulegu]] in 1257, shortly before the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|sack of Baghdad]]. The [[Safavids]] fortified the town, and the [[Qajars]] repulsed an attack by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] during [[Fath Ali Shah]]'s rule (1797–1834). Kermanshah was occupied by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] between 1723–1729 and 1731–1732.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

===Modern history===

Occupied by the [[Imperial Russian army]] in 1914, followed by the [[Ottoman Army (1861–1922)|Ottoman Army]] in 1915 during [[World War I]], it was evacuated in 1917 when the [[British Armed Forces|British forces]] arrived there to expel the Ottomans. Kermanshah played an important role in the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]] during the [[Qajar dynasty]] period and the Republic Movement in [[Pahlavi dynasty]] period. The city was harshly damaged during the [[Iran–Iraq War]], and although it was rebuilt, it has not yet fully recovered.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

==Climate==
Kermanshah has a climate which is heavily influenced by the proximity of the [[Zagros]] mountains, classified as a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa''; [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Dohk'') bordering on a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dsa''). The city's altitude and exposed location relative to westerly winds makes precipitation a little bit high (more than twice that of [[Tehran]]), but at the same time produces huge [[Diurnal air temperature variation|diurnal temperature]] swings especially in the virtually rainless summers, which remain extremely hot during the day. Kermanshah experiences rather cold winters and there are usually rainfalls in fall and spring. Snow cover is seen for at least a couple of weeks in winter.

===Taq-e Bostan===
{{main|Taq-e Bostan}}
[[Taq-e Bostan|Taghbostan]] is a series of large [[rock relief]]s from the era of [[Sassanid Empire]] of Persia, the [[History of Iran|Iranian dynasty]] which ruled [[western Asia]] from 226 to 650 AD. This example of [[Sassanid art]] is located {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} from the city center of Kermanshah in western [[Iran]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=طاق بستان کجاست؟ {{!}} وبلاگ اسنپ تریپ|url=https://www.snapptrip.com/blog/طاق-بستان-کجاست/|access-date=2021-05-17}}</ref> It is located in the heart of the [[Zagros Mountains|Zagros mountains]], where it has endured almost 1,700 years of wind and rain.

The carvings, some of the finest and best-preserved examples of Persian sculpture under the Sassanids, include representations of the investitures of [[Ardashir II]] (379–383) and [[Shapur III]] (383–388). Like other Sassanid symbols, [[Taq-e Bostan|Taghbostan]] and its relief patterns accentuate power, religious tendencies, glory, honor, the vastness of the court, game and fighting spirit, festivity, joy, and rejoicing.

Sassanid kings chose a beautiful setting for their rock reliefs along an historic [[Silk Road]] caravan route [[waypoint]] and campground. The reliefs are adjacent a sacred spring that empties into a large reflecting pool at the base of a mountain cliff.

[[Taq-e Bostan|Taghbostan]] and its rock relief are one of the 30 surviving [[Sassanid]] relics of the [[Zagros Mountains]]. According to [[Arthur Pope]], the founder of Iranian art and archeology Institute in the US, "art was characteristic of the Iranian people and the gift which they endowed the world with."

One of the most impressive reliefs inside the largest grotto or ''ivan'' is the gigantic [[equestrian sculpture|equestrian]] figure of the Sassanid king [[Khosrow II]] (591-628 AD) mounted on his favorite charger, [[Shabdiz]]. Both horse and rider are arrayed in full battle armor. The arch rests on two columns that bear delicately carved patterns showing the tree of life or the sacred tree. Above the arch and located on two opposite sides are figures of two winged angels with [[Diadem (personal wear)|diadems]]. A noticeable border with flower patterns has been intricately carved around the outer layer of the arch. These same patterns can be seen on the official costumes of Sassanid kings.
Equestrian relief panel measured on 16.08.07 approx. 7.45&nbsp;m across by 4.25 m high.

===Behistun===
{{main|Behistun Inscription}}
The Behistun inscription is considered as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The [[Behistun Inscription]] (also ''Bisitun'' or ''Bisutun'', [[Modern Persian]]: بیستون; [[Old Persian]]: ''Bagastana'', meaning "the god's place or land") is a multi-lingual inscription located on [[Mount Behistun]].

The inscription includes three versions of the same text, written in three different [[cuneiform script]] languages: [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]], [[Elamite language|Elamite]], and [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]]. A British army officer, [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Henry Rawlinson]], had the inscription transcribed in two parts, in 1835 and 1843. Rawlinson was able to translate the Old Persian cuneiform text in 1838, and the Elamite and Babylonian texts were translated by Rawlinson and others after 1843. Babylonian was a later form of [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]: both are [[Semitic languages]]. In effect, then, the inscription is to [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] what the [[Rosetta Stone]] is to [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s: the document most crucial in the [[decipherment]] of a previously lost [[writing system|script]].

The inscription is approximately 15&nbsp;metres high by 25&nbsp;meters wide, and 100&nbsp;meters up a [[limestone]] cliff from an ancient road connecting the capitals of [[Babylonia]] and [[Medes|Media]] ([[Babylon]] and [[Ecbatana]]). It is extremely inaccessible as the mountainside was removed to make the inscription more visible after its completion. The Old Persian text contains 414 lines in five columns; the Elamite text includes 593 lines in eight columns and the Babylonian text is in 112 lines. The inscription was illustrated by a life-sized bas-relief of [[Darius the Great of Persia|Darius]], holding a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] as a sign of kingship, with his left foot on the chest of a figure lying on his back before him. The prostrate figure is reputed to be the [[pretender]] [[Gaumata]]. Darius is attended to the left by two servants, and ten one-metre figures stand to the right, with hands tied and rope around their necks, representing conquered peoples. [[Faravahar]] floats above, giving his blessing to the king. One figure appears to have been added after the others were completed, as was (oddly enough) Darius' beard,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} which is a separate block of stone attached with [[iron]] pins and [[lead]].

===Qajar dynasty monuments===
{{see also|Tekyeh Biglarbeygi|Tekyeh Moaven al-molk|Khajeh Barookh's House}}
[[File:Jame-shafeie-mosque.JPG|thumb|Jame-Shafeie Mosque<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jame-Shafeie Mosque|url=https://www.kojaro.com/attraction/6326-%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AC%D8%AF-%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B9-%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%B9%DB%8C/}}</ref>]]During the [[Qajar dynasty]] (1794 to 1925), [[Kermanshah Bazaar]], mosques and [[tekyeh]]s such as [[Tekyeh Biglarbeygi]] and [[Moaven al-molk Mosque]], and beautiful houses such as [[Khajeh Barookh's House]] were built.

[[Tekyeh Biglarbeygi]] is well known for unique mirror decoration. [[Tekyeh Biglarbeygi]] was made during Qajar dynasty by efforts of Abdullah khan Biglarbeygi.

[[Tekyeh Moaven al-molk]] is unique because it has many pictures on the walls that relate to [[shahnameh]], despite some of its more religious ones.

[[Khajeh Barookh's House]] is located in the old district of Faizabad, a [[Jewish]] neighborhood of the city. It was built by a Jewish merchant of the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] period, named Barookh/Baruch. The house, an historical depiction of Iranian architecture, was renamed "Randeh-Kesh House", after the last owner, is a "daroongara"(inward oriented) house and is connected through a vestibule to the exterior yard and through a corridor to the interior yard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kermanshahmiras.ir/fa_site/preview.asp?categoryid=11&code=5451|title=سازمان ميراث فرهنگي، گردشگري و صنايع دستي استان كرمانشاه|publisher=Kermanshahmiras.ir|access-date=2011-12-02|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927223503/http://www.kermanshahmiras.ir/fa_site/Preview.asp?categoryid=11&code=5451|archive-date=2007-09-27}}</ref> Surrounding the interior yard are rooms, brick pillars making the iwans(porches) of the house, and step-like column capitals decorated with brick-stalactite work. This house is among the rare Qajar houses with a private bathroom.

=== Bazaars ===
Kermanshah is home to at least one [[bazaar]] dating back to the Qajar period. '''Kermanshah Grand Bazaar''' or '''''Tarike Bazaar''''' was built around 1820 when [[Dowlatshah|Prince Mohammad Ali Mirza Dowlatshah]] of [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] dynasty governed over Kermanshah, and used to be the largest grand bazaar of [[Middle East]] during its time.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Salehnezhad|first=Narges|date=2016-06-25 |title=تاریکه بازار؛ معرف تاریخ شهر کرمانشاه|url=https://www.kojaro.com/2016/6/25/120030/kermanshhah-bazar/|website=Kojaro}}</ref>
