'''Clarington''' ([[Canada 2021 Census|2021]] population 101,427<ref name="2021census" />) is a lower-tier municipality in the [[Regional Municipality of Durham]] in [[Ontario]], Canada. It was incorporated in 1973 as the town of Newcastle with the merging of the town of [[Bowmanville]], the Village of [[Newcastle,_Ontario|Newcastle]] and the townships of Clarke and Darlington, and was established on January 1 1974.<ref>{{cite web |title=Orono Weekly Times, 2 Jan 1974, p. 1 |url=https://vitacollections.ca/claringtonnews/2924508/page/2 |website=Clarington Digital Newspaper Collection |publisher=CPL / CMA |access-date=27 October 2022}}</ref> In 1993, the town was renamed Clarington, a blending of the names of the two former townships. Darlington today is largely suburban, while Clarke remains largely rural. Bowmanville is the largest community in the municipality and is the home of the municipal offices.

Clarington is part of the [[Oshawa]] census metropolitan area in the eastern end of the [[Greater Toronto Area]] (GTA). Major employers in Clarington include the [[Darlington Nuclear Generating Station]], [[General Motors Canada]], and several medium to large-sized manufacturing businesses.

A major attraction in the municipality is the [[Canadian Tire Motorsport Park]] (formerly Mosport Park), a multi-track facility located north of Bowmanville that features a 2.459-mile (4.0&nbsp;km), 10-turn road course; a half-mile paved oval; a 2.4&nbsp;km advanced driver and race driver training facility and a 1.4&nbsp;km kart track (Mosport International Karting). It was also a host of the [[Canadian Grand Prix]] of [[Formula One]] before the event was moved to a [[Circuit Gilles Villeneuve|circuit]] in [[Montreal]] in the 1970s.

Canadian Tire Motorsport Park (CTMP) was also the location of three major music festivals held between 1970 and 1980. The [[Strawberry Fields Festival]] held August 7–9, 1970 featured [[Alice Cooper]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Grand Funk Railroad]], [[Procol Harum]], [[Ten Years After]], [[Lighthouse (band)|Lighthouse]], [[Crowbar (Canadian band)|Crowbar]] and [[Sly and the Family Stone]]. [[John Lennon]] was to be the headline act, bidding to gain exposure for his peace campaign, but after months of planning he backed out due to differences with the show's promoter. However, the event still used the title of [[The Beatles]]' 1967 single of the same name. [[Led Zeppelin]] were booked to play but also backed out.

[[Canada Jam]] was held August 26, 1978 and the [[Heatwave (festival)|Heatwave Festival]] was held August 23, 1980.
