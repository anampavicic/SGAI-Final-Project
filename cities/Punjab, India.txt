Nor did the Vedic religion know a caste system, the burning of widows, the ban on remarriage, images of gods and temples, Puja worship, Yoga, pilgrimages, vegetarianism, the holiness of cows, the doctrine of stages of life (''asrama''), or knew them only at their inception.

After Ranjit Singh's death in 1839, the empire was severely weakened by internal divisions and political mismanagement. This opportunity was used by the [[East India Company]] to launch the [[First Anglo-Sikh War|First]] and [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]]s. The country was finally annexed and dissolved at the end of the Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849 into separate [[princely states]] and the [[Punjab (British India)|province of Punjab]].

==== Colonial era ====
[[File:Punjab_1909.jpg|thumb|[[Punjab Province (British India)|British Punjab Province]], before 1947]]
The Punjab was annexed by the [[East India Company]] in 1849. Although nominally part of the [[Bengal Presidency]] it was administratively independent. During the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], apart from [[Rai Ahmad Khan Kharal|Revolt led by Ahmed Khan Kharal]] and [[Murree rebellion of 1857]], the Punjab remained relatively peaceful.<ref name="auto12">{{Cite book |last1=Arielli |first1=N. |title=Transnational Soldiers: Foreign Military Enlistment in the Modern Era |last2=Collins |first2=B. |date=28 November 2012 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1137296634}}</ref> In 1858, under the terms of the Queen's Proclamation issued by [[Queen Victoria]], the Punjab came under the direct rule of Britain. Colonial rule had a profound impact on all areas of Punjabi life. Economically it transformed the Punjab into the richest farming area of India, socially it sustained the power of large landowners and politically it encouraged cross-communal co-operation among land owning groups.<ref name="Punjab and the Raj, 1849-1947">{{Cite book |last=Talbot |first=Ian |title=Punjab and the Raj, 1849–1947 |date=1988 |publisher=Riverdale Company |isbn=0913215287}}</ref> The Punjab also became the major centre of recruitment into the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]]. By patronising influential local allies and focusing administrative, economic and constitutional policies on the rural population, the British ensured the loyalty of its large rural population.<ref name="Punjab and the Raj, 1849-1947" /> Administratively, colonial rule instated a system of bureaucracy and measure of the law. The 'paternal' system of the ruling elite was replaced by 'machine rule' with a system of laws, codes, and procedures. For purposes of control, the British established new forms of communication and transportation, including post systems, railways, roads, and telegraphs. The creation of [[Punjab Canal Colonies|Canal Colonies]] in western Punjab between 1860 and 1947 brought 14 million acres of land under cultivation, and revolutionised agricultural practices in the region.<ref name="Punjab and the Raj, 1849-1947" /> To the agrarian and commercial class was added a professional middle class that had risen the social ladder through the use of the English education, which opened up new professions in law, government, and medicine.{{sfn|Grewal|1990|p=131}} Despite these developments, colonial rule was marked by exploitation of resources. For the purpose of exports, the majority of external trade was controlled by British export banks. The Imperial government exercised control over the finances of Punjab and took the majority of the income for itself.{{sfn|Grewal|1990|pages=128—129}}

In 1919, [[Reginald Dyer]] ordered his troops to fire on a crowd of demonstrators, mostly Sikhs in [[Amritsar]]. The [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre|Jallianwala massacre]] fuelled the [[Indian independence movement]].<ref name=":9" /> Nationalists declared the independence of India from Lahore in 1930 but were quickly suppressed.<ref name=":9" /> The struggle for Indian independence witnessed competing and conflicting interests in the Punjab.

After the partition of the subcontinent had been decided, special meetings of the Western and Eastern Section of the Legislative Assembly were held on 23 June 1947 to decide whether or not the Province of the Punjab be partitioned. After voting on both sides, partition was decided and the existing Punjab Legislative Assembly was also divided into [[West Punjab]] [[Legislative Assembly]] and the [[East Punjab]] Legislative Assembly. This last Assembly before independence, held its last sitting on 4 July 1947.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pap.gov.pk/uploads/previous_members/S-1946-1947.htm |title=Punjab Legislative Assembly 1946 |access-date=28 November 2022 |archive-date=7 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207162416/http://www.pap.gov.pk/uploads/previous_members/S-1946-1947.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> During this period, the British granted separate independence to India and Pakistan, setting off massive communal violence as Punjabi Muslims fled to Pakistan and Hindu and Sikh Punjabis fled east to India.<ref name=":9" /> The Sikhs later demanded a Punjabi-speaking Punjab state with an autonomous Sikh government.<ref name=":9" />

==== Post-colonial era ====
During the [[British Raj|colonial era]], the various districts and princely states that made up [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab Province]] were religiously eclectic, each containing significant populations of [[Punjabi Muslims]], [[Punjabi Hindus]], [[Punjabi Sikhs]], [[Punjabi Christians]], along with other ethnic and religious minorities. However, a major consequence of independence and the partition of Punjab Province in 1947 was the sudden shift towards religious homogeneity occurred in all districts across province and region owing to the new international border that cut through the subdivision.

The demographic shift was captured when comparing decadal census data taken in 1941 and 1951 respectively, and was primarily due to wide scale migration but also caused by large-scale [[Religious persecution#Religious cleansing|religious cleansing]] riots which were witnessed across the region at the time. According to historical demographer [[Tim Dyson]], in the eastern regions of Punjab that ultimately became Indian Punjab following independence, districts that were 66% Hindu in 1941 became 80% Hindu in 1951; those that were 20% Sikh became 50% Sikh in 1951. Conversely, in the western regions of Punjab that ultimately became [[Punjab, Pakistan|Pakistani Punjab]], all districts became almost exclusively Muslim by 1951.{{sfn|Dyson|2018|pp=188–189}}

Following independence, several small Punjabi princely states, including Patiala, [[Instrument of Accession|acceded]] to the Union of India and were united into the [[PEPSU]]. In 1956 this was integrated with the state of East Punjab to create a new, enlarged Indian state called simply "Punjab".

In 1966, following Hindu and Sikh Punjabi demands, the Indian government divided Punjab into the state of Punjab and the Hindi majority-speaking states of [[Haryana]] and [[Himachal Pradesh]].<ref name=":9" />

During the 1960s, Punjab was known for its prosperity within India, largely due to its fertile lands and industrious inhabitants. However, a significant portion of the Sikh community felt a sense of disparity from the central government of India. The roots of such grievances stretched back several decades, with the primary issue revolving around the distribution of water from the trio of rivers – Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej – that flowed across the Punjabi territory.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal |last=Jetly |first=Rajshree |date=2008 |title=THE KHALISTAN MOVEMENT IN INDIA: The Interplay of Politics and State Power |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41421658 |journal=International Review of Modern Sociology |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=61–75 |issn=0973-2047 |jstor=41421658 |access-date=18 May 2023 |archive-date=9 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230409031644/https://www.jstor.org/stable/41421658 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Although Punjab had these waterways running across its lands, it was lawfully granted only a quarter of the water, precisely 24%, as per the [[Interstate River Water Disputes Act|Inter-State Water Disputes Act]]. The rest, a staggering 76%, was assigned to Rajasthan and Haryana. To many Punjabis, especially the farming community who heavily depended on these waters for irrigation, this allocation seemed inequitable. The water distribution was a significant contributing factor to the growing sense of disgruntlement against the central government.<ref name=":5" />

The seeds of discontent further sprouted with the advent of the Green Revolution during the 1960s. This initiative sought to boost agricultural output by introducing high-yield seed varieties, and enhancing the use of fertilisers and irrigation. In the midst of this transformative phase, Punjab became known as India's "food basket", contributing considerably to the nation's agricultural production. Yet, the financial profits garnered from this agricultural surge weren't fairly distributed.<ref name=":8">{{Cite journal |last=Jodhka |first=Surinder S. |date=2001 |editor-last=Purewal |editor-first=Shinder |editor2-last=Puri |editor2-first=H.

The majority of the gains were hoarded by landowners, who typically owned large plots and were best positioned to exploit the emerging technologies and farming practices. The working class and economically underprivileged segments of society, who often toiled as labourers on these farms, were left with only minor benefits. This uneven distribution of wealth conflicted sharply with Sikh religious customs, which preached economic justice and fair wealth distribution.<ref name=":10">{{Cite journal |last1=Siraj |first1=Dr Uzma |last2=Dashti |first2=Dr Asghar Ali |last3=Ahmad |first3=Dr Mamnoon |date=19 January 2023 |title=The Transformation Of Ethno-Nationalist Movements Into Secessionist Movements: A Case Study Of The Khalistan Movement |url=https://journalppw.com/index.php/jpsp/article/view/15253 |journal=Journal of Positive School Psychology |language=en |pages=743–752 |issn=2717-7564 |access-date=18 May 2023 |archive-date=18 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230518004853/https://journalppw.com/index.php/jpsp/article/view/15253 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Green Revolution dealt a severe blow to Punjab's small farmers. The larger landowners, with their access to abundant resources and capital, were well-suited to adopt the agricultural innovations brought by the Revolution. This situation sparked further resentment among small farmers, many of whom were forced to relinquish their lands, unable to compete, thereby intensifying the economic chasm.<ref name=":5" />

Beyond the farming sector, Punjab lacked substantial employment opportunities. An excessive focus on agriculture resulted in the state's industrial sector's neglect, leaving it notably underdeveloped. This skewed concentration on agriculture meant that many economically challenged peasants, without feasible employment alternatives, felt cornered and disgruntled.<ref name=":8" />

Even the affluent landowners, the initial beneficiaries of the Green Revolution, felt the economic pinch due to soaring prices of farming inputs like fertilisers and pesticides, and the dearth of essential resources like electricity and water.<ref name=":10" />

Although the Green Revolution was primarily conceived to amplify productivity, it couldn't sustain this increased output over a prolonged period. The introduction of novel crop varieties led to a decline in genetic diversity, thus introducing a new ecological risk. Furthermore, these new crops demanded more water and were highly dependent on chemical fertilisers, both of which had deleterious environmental consequences. Overuse of water led to groundwater resource depletion, and heavy chemical usage adversely affected soil and water systems, further undermining long-term productivity.<ref name=":5" />

From 1981 to 1995 the state suffered a 14-year-long [[Insurgency in Punjab, India|insurgency]]. Problems began due to disputes between Punjabi Sikhs and the central government of the Republic of India. Tensions escalated throughout the early 1980s and eventually culminated with [[Operation Blue Star]] in 1984; an Indian Army operation aimed at the dissident Sikh community of Punjab. Shortly thereafter, Indian Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] was [[Assassination of Indira Gandhi|assassinated]] by two of her Sikh bodyguards. The decade that followed was noted for widespread inter-communal violence and accusations of genocide on the Sikh community by the Indian government.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sikh separatism |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/India/Sikh-separatism |access-date=14 July 2020 |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |archive-date=15 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211215183441/https://www.britannica.com/place/India/Sikh-separatism |url-status=live }}</ref>{{better source needed|reason=Britannica is tertiary, need WP:SCHOLARLY sources|date=July 2024}}

==Geography==
Punjab is in northwestern India and has a total area of {{convert|50362|km2|mi2}}. Punjab is bordered by Pakistan's [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab province]] on the west, [[Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)|Jammu and Kashmir]] on the north, [[Himachal Pradesh]] on the northeast and [[Haryana]] and [[Rajasthan]] on the south.<ref name="Borders" /> Most of Punjab lies in a fertile, alluvial plain with perennial rivers and an extensive irrigation canal system.<ref name="ReferenceB" /> A belt of undulating [[Shiwalik Hills|hills]] extends along the northeastern part of the state at the foot of the Himalayas. Its average elevation is {{convert|300|m|ft}} above sea level, with a range from {{convert|180|m|ft}} in the southwest to more than {{convert|500|m|ft}} around the northeast border. The southwest of the state is semi-arid, eventually merging into the [[Thar Desert]]. Of the five Punjab rivers, three—Sutlej, Beas and Ravi—flow through the Indian state. The Sutlej and Ravi define parts of the international border with Pakistan.

The soil characteristics are influenced to a limited extent by the topography, vegetation and parent rock. The variation in soil profile characteristics are much more pronounced because of the regional climatic differences.<ref name="Soil Types">{{Cite web |title=Status of Environment & Related Issues |url=http://punenvis.nic.in/index2.aspx?slid=205&sublinkid=1127&langid=1&mid=1 |access-date=22 March 2017 |publisher=ENVIS Centre : Punjab |archive-date=9 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210309132637/http://punenvis.nic.in/index2.aspx?slid=205&sublinkid=1127&langid=1&mid=1 |url-status=live }}</ref> Punjab is divided into three distinct regions on the basis of soil types: southwestern, central, and eastern. Punjab falls under [[Earthquake hazard zoning of India|seismic zones]] II, III, and IV. Zone II is considered a low-damage risk zone; zone III is considered a moderate-damage risk zone; and zone IV is considered a high-damage risk zone.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pragati Infosoft Pvt.

===Climate===
[[File:Punjab Monsoon.jpg|thumb|right|Agricultural fields of Punjab during the monsoon]]

The geography and [[subtropic]]al latitudinal location of Punjab lead to large variations in temperature from month to month. Even though only limited regions experience temperatures below {{convert|0|C|F}}, ground frost is commonly found in the majority of Punjab during the winter season. The temperature rises gradually with high [[humidity]] and overcast skies. However, the rise in temperature is steep when the sky is clear and humidity is low.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web |title=Weather & Climate Of Punjab |url=http://www.discoveredindia.com/punjab/the-green-granary-of-india/seasons.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105133815/http://www.discoveredindia.com/punjab/the-green-granary-of-india/seasons.htm |archive-date=5 January 2016 |access-date=27 October 2015}}</ref>

The maximum temperatures usually occur in mid-May and June. The temperature remains above {{convert|40|C|F}} in the entire region during this period. Ludhiana recorded the highest maximum temperature at {{convert|46.1|C|F}} with Patiala and Amritsar recording {{convert|45.5|C|F}}. The maximum temperature during the summer in Ludhiana remains above {{convert|41|C|F}} for a duration of one and a half months. These areas experience the lowest temperatures in January. The sun rays are oblique during these months and the cold winds control the temperature at daytime.<ref name="auto" />

Punjab experiences its minimum temperature from December to February. The lowest temperature was recorded at Amritsar ({{convert|0.2|C|F}}) and Ludhiana stood second with {{convert|0.5|C|F}}. The minimum temperature of the region remains below {{convert|5|C|F}} for almost two months during the winter season. The highest minimum temperature of these regions in June is more than the daytime maximum temperatures experienced in January and February. Ludhiana experiences minimum temperatures above {{convert|27|C|F}} for more than two months. The annual average temperature in the entire state is approximately {{convert|21|C|F}}. Further, the mean monthly temperature range varies between {{convert|9|C|F}} in July to approximately {{convert|18|C|F}} in November.<ref name="auto" />

====Seasons====
Punjab experiences three main seasons. They are:
* Summer (mid-April to the end of June)
* Monsoon (early July to the end of September)
* Winter (early December to the end of February).<ref name="auto" />

Apart from these three, the state experiences transitional seasons like:
* Pre-summer season (March to mid-April): This is the period of transition between winter and summer.
* Post-[[monsoon]] season (September to end of November): This is the period of transition between monsoon and winter seasons.<ref name="auto" />

=====Summer=====
Punjab starts experiencing mildly hot temperatures in February. The actual summer season commences in mid-April and the heat continues until the end of August. High temperatures between May and August hover between 40 and 47&nbsp;°C. The area experiences atmospheric pressure variations during the summer months. The atmospheric pressure of the region remains around 987 millibar during February and it reaches 970 millibar in June.<ref name="auto" />

=====Monsoon=====
Punjab's rainy season begins in the first week of July as monsoon currents generated in the [[Bay of Bengal]] bring rain to the region. The monsoon lasts up to mid-September.<ref name="auto" />

=====Post-Monsoon transitional season=====
The monsoon begins to reduce by the second week of September. This brings a gradual change in climate and temperature. The time between October and November is the transitional period between monsoon and winter seasons. Weather during this period is generally temperate and dry.<ref name="auto" />

=====Winter=====
Temperature variation is minimal in January. The mean night and day temperatures fall to {{convert|5|C|F}} and {{convert|12|C|F}}, respectively.<ref name="auto" />

=====Post-Winter transitional season=====
The effects of winter diminish by the first week of March. The hot summer season commences in mid-April. This period is marked by occasional showers with hail storms and [[squalls]] that cause extensive damage to crops. The winds remain dry and warm during the last week of March, commencing the harvest period.<ref name="auto" />

====Rainfall====
* Monsoon Rainfall
Monsoon season provides most of the rainfall for the region. Punjab receives rainfall from the monsoon current of the Bay of Bengal. This monsoon current enters the state from the southeast in the first week of July.<ref name="auto" />
* Winter Rainfall
The winter season remains very cool with temperatures falling below freezing at some places. Winter also brings in some western disturbances.<ref name="auto" /> Rainfall in the winter provides relief to the farmers as some of the winter crops in the region of Shivalik Hills are entirely dependent on this rainfall. As per meteorological statistics, the sub-Shivalik area receives more than {{convert|100|mm|in}} of rainfall in the winter months.<ref name="auto" />

===Wildlife===
[[File:Agriculture in Punjab India.jpg|thumb|Agriculture in Punjab]]

The fauna of the area is rich, with 396 types of birds, 214 kinds of [[Lepidoptera]], 55 varieties of fish, 20 types of reptiles, and 19 kinds of mammals. The state of Punjab has large wetland areas, bird sanctuaries that house numerous species of birds, and many zoological parks. Wetlands include the national wetland [[Harike Wetland|Hari-Ke-Pattan]], the wetland of [[Kanjli Wetland|Kanjli]], and the wetlands of Kapurthala Sutlej. Wildlife sanctuaries include the Harike in the district of Tarn Taran Sahib, the Zoological Park in Rupnagar, Chhatbir Bansar Garden in Sangrur, [[Aam Khas Bagh]] in Sirhind, Amritsar's famous [[Ram Bagh Palace]], Shalimar Garden in Kapurthala, and the famous Baradari Garden in the city of Patiala.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Flora And Fauna Of Punjab |url=http://www.discoveredindia.com/punjab/the-green-granary-of-india/flora-and-fauna-of-punjab.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210182308/http://www.discoveredindia.com/punjab/the-green-granary-of-india/flora-and-fauna-of-punjab.htm |archive-date=10 December 2015 |access-date=27 October 2015}}</ref>

The [[Sikh]] shrine, [[Golden Temple]] ([[Harmandir Sahib]]), is in the city of Amritsar, which houses the [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]], the topmost Sikh religious body. The [[Sri Akal Takht Sahib]], which is within the Golden Temple complex, is the highest temporal seat of Sikhs. Of the five Takhts (Temporal Seats of religious authority) of [[Sikhism]], three are in Punjab. These are Sri Akal Takht Sahib, [[Damdama Sahib]] and [[Anandpur Sahib]]. At least one Sikh [[Gurdwara]] can be found in almost every village in the state, as well as in the towns and cities (in various architectural styles and sizes).

[[Mandir|Hindu Mandirs]] can be found all over Punjab with the [[Durgiana Temple|Shri Durgiana Mandir]] in Amritsar, and the [[Devi Talab Mandir|Shri Devi Talab Mandir]] in Jalandhar visited by many pilgrims every year. A segment of [[Punjabi Hindus]] exhibit [[Religious syncretism|syncretic religious traditions]] in spiritual kinship with Sikhism. This not only includes veneration of the Sikh Gurus in private practice but also visit to Sikh Gurdwaras in addition to Hindu Mandirs.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Raj |first1=Dhooleka Sarhadi |title=Where Are You From?

{{Main|Politics of Punjab, India|Government of Punjab, India|Greater Punjab Movement, India|Punjab Legislative Assembly|List of districts of Punjab, India}}
Punjab is governed through a parliamentary system of representative democracy. Each of the states of India possesses a parliamentary system of government, with a ceremonial state [[List of governors of Punjab, India|Governor]], appointed by the [[President of India]] on the advice of the central government. The head of government is an indirectly elected [[List of chief ministers of Punjab, India|Chief Minister]] who is vested with most of the executive powers. The term length of the government is five years. The state legislature, the [[Vidhan Sabha]], is the unicameral [[Punjab Legislative Assembly]], with 117 members elected from single-seat constituencies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punjabassembly.nic.in/index.php/about-vidhan-sabha|title=About Vidhan Sabha|website=punjabassembly.nic.in|access-date=7 October 2019|archive-date=4 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191004055941/http://www.punjabassembly.nic.in/index.php/about-vidhan-sabha|url-status=live}}</ref>

The capital of Punjab is [[Chandigarh]], which also serves as the capital of [[Haryana]] and is thus administered separately as a [[union territory]] of India. The judicial branch of the state government is provided by the [[Punjab and Haryana High Court]] in Chandigarh.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ebc-india.com/lawyer/hcourts.htm|title=Jurisdiction and Seats of Indian High Courts|access-date=12 May 2008|publisher=Eastern Book Company|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510190512/http://www.ebc-india.com/lawyer/hcourts.htm|archive-date=10 May 2008}}</ref>

The three major political parties in the state are the [[Aam Aadmi Party, Punjab|Aam Aadmi Party]], a centrist to left-wing party, the [[Shiromani Akali Dal]], a [[Sikh]] [[right-wing]] [[Punjabiyat]] party and the [[Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee|Indian National Congress]], a [[Ideology of the Indian National Congress|centrist]] [[Big tent|catch-all]] party.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Ashutosh|date=2004|title=Electoral Politics in Punjab: Study of Akali Dal|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=39|issue=14/15|pages=1515–1520|issn=0012-9976|jstor=4414869}}</ref> [[President's rule]] has been imposed in Punjab eight times so far, since 1950, for different reasons. In terms of the absolute number of days, Punjab was under the President's rule for 3,510 days, which is approximately 10 years. Much of this was in the 80s during the height of militancy in Punjab. Punjab was under the President's rule for five continuous years from 1987 to 1992.

In Punjab the consumption of fertiliser per hectare is 223.46&nbsp;kg as compared to 90&nbsp;kg nationally. The state has been awarded the National Productivity Award for agriculture extension services for ten years, from 1991 to 1992 to 1998–99 and from 2001 to 2003–04. In recent years a drop in productivity has been observed, mainly due to falling fertility of the soil. This is believed to be due to excessive use of fertilisers and pesticides over the years. Another worry is the rapidly falling water table on which almost 90% of the agriculture depends; alarming drops have been witnessed in recent years. By some estimates, groundwater is falling by a meter or more per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2010/world/qa-upmanu-lall-gives-insight-to-indias-nexus-of-energy-food-and-water|title=Q&A: Upmanu Lall on India's Nexus of Energy, Food and Water|publisher=[[Circle of Blue]]|author=J.
