'''Valparaíso''' ({{IPA|es|balpaɾaˈiso|lang}}) is a major city, [[Communes of Chile|commune]], [[Port|seaport]] and [[naval base]] facility in [[Valparaíso Region]], [[Chile]].  

[[Greater Valparaíso]] is the second-largest populace in the country, as well as the second-largest city in the Greater Valparaíso [[Metropolitan area|metro area]] (behind [[Viña del Mar]]). Valparaíso was named originally for [[Valparaíso de Arriba]], in [[Castilla–La Mancha|Castile-La Mancha]], [[Spain]]. It is located about {{cvt|120|km|mi}} northwest of [[Santiago]], by road, and is one of the [[Pacific Ocean]]'s most important seaports. Valparaíso is the [[Capital city|capital]] of Chile's second most-populated administrative region and has been the  [[Chilean Navy]] headquarters since 1817, as well as being the seat of the [[National Congress of Chile|Chilean National Congress]] (since 1990). 

Valparaíso played an important geopolitical role in the second half of the 19th century when it served as a major stopover for ships traveling between the [[Atlantic]] and [[Pacific]] oceans via  the [[Straits of Magellan]]. The area experienced rapid growth during its golden age as a magnet for European immigrants, when the city was known by international sailors as "Little [[San Francisco]]" and "jewel of the [[Pacific]]".<ref>''Between Two Worlds: Memoirs of a Philosopher-Scientist'' {{ISBN|978-3-319-29250-2}} p. 120</ref> Notable acquisitions from this golden age include [[Latin America]]'s oldest [[stock exchange]], the continent's first volunteer [[fire department]], Chile's first [[public library]], and the oldest [[Spanish language]] newspaper in continuous publication in the world, {{Lang|es|[[El Mercurio de Valparaíso]]}}. In 2003, the historic quarter of Valparaíso was declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

The twentieth century was unfavorable to Valparaíso, as many wealthy families abandoned the city. The opening of the [[Panama Canal]] in 1914, and the associated reduction in ship traffic, dealt a serious blow to the region's shipping- and port-based economy. By the 21st century, the port of [[San Antonio, Chile|San Antonio]] had surpassed Valparaíso in trade volume ([[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEU]]) handled,<ref>{{Cite news |title=Valparaíso sube dos puestos y San Antonio se mantiene TOP 10 en ránking de puertos de Cepal |url=https://portalportuario.cl/valparaiso-sube-dos-puestos-y-san-antonio-se-mantiene-top-10-en-ranking-de-puertos-de-cepal/ |date=2018-05-28 |access-date=2022-03-13 |work=PortalPortuario.cl |language=Spanish |archive-date=2022-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220412074900/https://portalportuario.cl/valparaiso-sube-dos-puestos-y-san-antonio-se-mantiene-top-10-en-ranking-de-puertos-de-cepal/ |url-status=live }}</ref> leading to the questioning of its traditional moniker of ''Puerto Principal'' ("principal port") of Chile.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Mensaje de Jorge Sharp en Twitter generó disputa por título de "puerto principal" entre San Antonio y Valparaíso |url=https://www.soychile.cl/San-Antonio/Sociedad/2017/08/22/483082/Mensaje-de-Jorge-Sharp-en-Twitter-genero-disputa-por-titulo-de-puerto-principal-entre-San-Antonio-y-Valparaiso.aspx |access-date=2022-03-13 |work=SoyChile |year=2017 |language=Spanish |archive-date=2017-08-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826133604/http://www.soychile.cl/San-Antonio/Sociedad/2017/08/22/483082/Mensaje-de-Jorge-Sharp-en-Twitter-genero-disputa-por-titulo-de-puerto-principal-entre-San-Antonio-y-Valparaiso.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref> 

Between the years of 2000 to 2015, the city experienced a recovery, attracting artists, tourists, and cultural entrepreneurs, who settled after they were attracted by the city's hillside historic districts. Today, many thousands of people visit Valparaíso each month, from Chile and abroad, to enjoy the city's labyrinth of cobbled alleys and colorful buildings. The Port of Valparaíso still continues to be a major distribution center for container traffic, [[copper]], and fruit exports. It also receives growing attention from cruise ships that visit during the South American summer. Most significantly, Valparaíso has transformed itself into a major educational and entertainment hub, with four large [[Chilean Traditional Universities|traditional universities]], and several large [[Vocational school|vocational colleges]]. 

While the city is well-known for its [[Artisan|artisans]] and [[Bohemianism|bohemian culture]],<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Valparaíso: la vieja y nueva bohemia |journal=Revista chilena de infectología |url=https://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0716-10182011000300005 |last=Payá G. |first=Ernesto |volume=28 |issue=3 |doi=10.4067/S0716-10182011000300005 |year=2011 |page=229 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Valparaiso: new and old bohemia |doi-access=free |access-date=2022-05-04 |archive-date=2023-02-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230211124143/https://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0716-10182011000300005 |url-status=live }}</ref> it is also famous as the home of several highly-regarded music festivals and other artistic events. The largest, and arguably most iconic, is the annual [[Viña del Mar International Song Festival|''Viña Del Mar International Song Festival'']] (often simply called "Viña" or "Viña Del Mar"). Typically held in March, in a recently-refurbished, 40,000-capacity [[Amphitheatre|amphitheater]], "Viña" is one of the biggest annual economic boosts to the region, as the event usually sells-out completely, and thousands of attendees and workers will travel to and stay in the city and metro area. In addition to showcasing numerous performers of many styles, and awarding various prizes, the internationally-televised and [[Live streaming|live-streamed]] festival is typically headlined by superstar musicians, from both the [[Hispanophone|Spanish-]] and [[English language|English]]-speaking worlds.

==History==
{{Moresources|section|date=July 2023}}
Some older works starting with [[Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna]] (1869) claim that Valparaíso was within the range of the [[Chango people]], but clear evidence for this is lacking.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Los changos, su supuesta presencia en la bahía de Valparaíso |journal=Boletín Histórico |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cL19DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA79 |last=Vera Villarroel |first=Jaime |date=6 December 2018 |issue=XXII |volume=VII |pages=79–103 |language=Spanish |access-date=25 March 2023 |archive-date=25 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230325211356/https://books.google.com/books?id=cL19DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA79 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Bay of Valparaíso's first ethnically identifiable population were [[Picunche]] natives, known for their agriculture. [[Spanish people|Spanish]] explorers, considered the first European discoverers of Chile, arrived in 1536, aboard the ''Santiaguillo'', a supply ship sent by [[Diego de Almagro]]. The ''Santiaguillo'' carried men and supplies for Almagro's expedition, under the command of [[Juan de Saavedra]], who named the town after his native village of [[Valparaíso de Arriba]] in [[Cuenca Province (Spain)|Cuenca Province]], Spain.
[[File:Valpo1830.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|View of Valparaíso Bay (1830)]]
During Spanish colonial times, Valparaíso remained a small village, with only a few houses and a church. On some occasions she was attacked by English pirates and privateers, such as [[Francis Drake]] with his ship ''[[Golden Hind]]'' in 1578<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sugden |first1=John |title=Sir Francis Drake |date=2012 |publisher=Random House |url=https://archive.org/details/sirfrancisdrake0000sugd_f7c7 |isbn=9781448129508|page=125}}</ref> and later his cousin [[Richard Hawkins]] with his ship [[English ship Dainty (1588)|''Dainty'']] in 1594. Drake's sack of Valparaíso gave origin to the legend about [[Cueva del Pirata]].<ref name=Sonia2015>{{Cite book|title=Mitos de Chile: Enciclopedia de seres, apariciones y encantos|last=Montecino Aguirre|first=Sonia|publisher=[[Catalonia (publisher)|Catalonia]]|year=2015|isbn=978-956-324-375-8|pages=196–197|language=es}}</ref>

In 1810, a wealthy merchant built the first pier in the [[history of Chile]] and the first during the colonial era. In its place today, stands the building of El Mercurio de Valparaíso. The ocean then rose to this point. Reclamation of land from the sea moved the coastline five blocks away. Between 1810 and 1830, he built much of the existing port of the city, including much of the land reclamation work that now comprises the city's commercial centre. 

In 1814, the naval [[Battle of Valparaíso]] was fought offshore of the town, between American and British ships involved in the [[War of 1812]]. After Chile's independence from Spain (1818), beginning the [[Republican Chile|Republican Era]], Valparaíso became the main harbour for the nascent Chilean navy, and opened international trade opportunities that had been formerly limited to Spain and its other colonies.
[[File:Bahía de Valparaíso, 1863.jpg|thumb|Valparaíso (c. 1863)]]
Valparaíso soon became a desired stopover for ships rounding South America via the [[Straits of Magellan]] and [[Cape Horn]]. It gained particular importance supporting and supplying the [[California Gold Rush]] (1848–1858). As a major seaport, Valparaíso received immigrants from many European countries, mainly from [[British people|Britain]], [[German Chilean|Germany]], [[French people|France]], [[Swiss people|Switzerland]] and [[Italian Chilean|Italy]]. German, French, Italian and English were commonly spoken among its citizens, who founded and published newspapers in these languages.

Valparaíso found maritime competition with Callao (Perú). Both cities sought to be the dominant port on the Pacific Coast of South America during the period of time known as the High Trade (1880–1930). <ref>{{Cite journal |last=Couyoumdjian |first=Juan Ricardo |title=El Alto Comercio de Valparaiso y las Grandes Casas Extranjeras, 1880-1930: Una Aproximacion |date=2000 |url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&pid=S0717-71942000003300002&lng=es&nrm=iso&tlng=es |journal=Historia (Santiago) |volume=33 |pages=63–99 |doi=10.4067/S0717-71942000003300002 |issn=0717-7194 |doi-access=free |access-date=2023-03-10 |archive-date=2023-03-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230310155216/https://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&pid=S0717-71942000003300002&lng=es&nrm=iso&tlng=es |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[British Chilean|British community]], ''La Colonia Britanica'', prospered in Valparaíso between the 1820s and 1920s. Firms such as [[Antony Gibbs & Sons]], Duncan Fox, and [[Williamson-Balfour Company]] were doing business in the town, which had become a significant trading center by 1840, with 166 British ships, out of a total of 287, anchored in its port. The British settled on Cerro Alegre (Mount Pleasant) and Cerro Concepción. The Association of Voluntary Firemen was created in 1851, a telegraph service to Santiago was operating by 1852, and Chile's first telephone service was set up in 1880. The British Hospital was founded in 1897, and the British Arch, ''Arco Británico'', was erected in 1911. However, by 1895, Italian immigrants exceeded the British, and both the Italians and Germans were in larger numbers by 1907. By 1920, both the Italians and Spanish outnumbered the British, and the primary British community within Chile resided in Santiago.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Edmundson |first1=William |title=A History of the British Presence in Chile: From Bloody Mary to Charles Darwin and the Decline of British Influence |date=2009 |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |location=New York |isbn=9780230114838 |pages=110–115}}</ref> 

[[File:Terremoto de Valparaíso 1906.JPG|thumb|[[1906 Valparaíso earthquake]]]]
International immigration transformed the local culture from Spanish origins and Amerindian origins, in ways that included the construction of the first non-Catholic cemetery of [[Chile]], the [[Dissidents Cemetery|Dissidents' Cemetery]]. [[association football|Football (soccer)]] was introduced to Chile by [[English Chilean|English immigrants]]; and the first private Catholic school in Chile, ''Le Collège des Sacrés Cœurs'' ("Sacred Hearts College") and its accompanying [[Sacred Hearts Church (Valparaíso)|Sacred Hearts Church]], by [[French Chilean|French immigrants]]. Immigrants from Scotland and Germany founded the first private secular schools ([[The Mackay School]] and ''Die Deutsche Schule'', respectively). Immigrants formed the first volunteer fire-fighting units (still a volunteer activity in Chile). Their buildings reflected a variety of European styles, making Valparaíso more varied than some other Chilean cities.

On 18 August 1906, a major earthquake struck Valparaíso; there was extensive property damage and thousands of deaths. The Chilean doctor, Carlos Van Buren, of [[North Americans in Chile|U.S.]] descent, was involved in the medical care of earthquake victims. He later established the Hospital  Carlos Van Buren in 1912.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://hekint.org/2017/02/22/the-van-buren-hospital-in-the-history-of-chile/ |title=The Van Buren Hospital in the history of Chile |date=13 April 2014 |website=hekint.org |language=en |access-date=20 July 2023 |archive-date=20 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230720172527/https://hekint.org/2017/02/22/the-van-buren-hospital-in-the-history-of-chile/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The golden age of Valparaíso's commerce ended after the opening of the [[Panama Canal]] in 1914. Shipping shifted to the canal as captains sought to avoid the risks of the Strait of Magellan. The port's use and traffic declined significantly, causing a decline in the city's economy. The opening of the Panama Canal was one of the most critical events in the shaping of Valparaío's economy.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvx1ht3b |title=Shaping Terrain: City Building in Latin America |date=2016 |publisher=University Press of Florida |doi=10.2307/j.ctvx1ht3b |jstor=j.ctvx1ht3b |access-date=2023-03-10 |archive-date=2023-03-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230310145114/https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvx1ht3b |url-status=live }}</ref> Since the turn of the 21st century, shipping has increased in the last few decades with fruit exports, opening the [[Chilean economy]] to world commerce, and larger-scale, [[Post-Panamax]] ships that do not fit the Panama Canal.

On 28 March 1814, the USS ''Essex'' was defeated by British frigates ''Phoebe'' and ''Cherub'' during the [[War of 1812]], leading to the deaths of 58 US Marines. Captain [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]], a survivor of this attack, would retire to [[Portersville, Indiana]], and request changing the name to [[Valparaiso, Indiana|Valparaiso]], commemorating the only naval battle he ever lost. By 2 August 1820, the [[Freedom Expedition of Perú|Liberating Expedition of Peru]] sailed from Valparaíso.

At 10:30 pm on the evening of 19 November 1822, Valparaíso experienced a violent earthquake that left the city in ruins; of the 16,000 residents, casualties included at least 66 adults and 12 children, as well as 110 people wounded. The next day, a meteor trail was visible from Quillota to Valparaíso, seen as a religious experience for much of the population.

In 1826, the [[Royal Navy]] Great Britain established a [[Pacific Station|South America Station]] in Valparaíso to maintain British naval interest in the region. It would remain until 1837, when it was relocated to [[Esquimalt, British Columbia]]. 12 September 1827 saw the establishment of {{Lang|es|[[El Mercurio de Valparaíso]]}}, the oldest circulating newspaper in the [[Spanish language]] worldwide.

In May 1828, a constitutional convention began regular meetings in the [[San Francisco Church (Valparaíso)|church of San Francisco]]. By August 9, the [[Chilean Constitution of 1980|Constitution of the Republic of Chile]] was fully drafted and disseminated.

On 6 June 1837, Minister [[Diego Portales]] was shot at the port outside of [[Barón Hill|Baron Hill]] on suspicion of promoting conspirators who opposed the [[War of the Confederation|Peru-Bolivian Confederation]], considered a turning point of Chilean public opinion and the purpose of the war.

By 1851, the first fire brigade in the country was formed. The next year potable running water became available, as well as the first [[telegraph]] service in Latin America, between the city and [[Santiago]]. It would be another four years before streetlights, with 700 gas lanterns, were installed. In 1861 the first tram company was formed, mostly using horses or mules to draw them, and fully established over the next few years.

In 1852, British shipping company Williamson, Balfour & Cía was established in Valparaíso to handle trade in the region. <ref>{{Cite journal |last=Couyoumdjian |first=Juan Ricardo |title=El Alto Comercio de Valparaiso y las Grandes Casas Extranjeras, 1880-1930: Una Aproximacion |date=2000 |url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&pid=S0717-71942000003300002&lng=es&nrm=iso&tlng=es |journal=Historia (Santiago) |volume=33 |pages=63–99 |doi=10.4067/S0717-71942000003300002 |issn=0717-7194 |doi-access=free |access-date=2023-03-10 |archive-date=2023-03-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230310155216/https://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&pid=S0717-71942000003300002&lng=es&nrm=iso&tlng=es |url-status=live }}</ref>

Taking advantage of the total lack of defenses, a Spanish fleet commanded by [[Casto Méndez Núñez]] [[Bombardment of Valparaíso|bombarded the city]] during the [[Chincha Islands War]] in 1866. Chilean merchant ships were sunk, except for those vessels whose captains hoisted foreign flags.

A merger of the National Steamship Company and Chilean Steamship Company, the [[CSAV|South American Steamship Company]] was created as a national response to the increasing dominance of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company in 1872. In 1880 the Chilean Telephone Company was formed by Americans Joseph Husbands, Peter MacKellar, James Martin, and the US consul Lucius Foot, the first official telephone company in the country. Three years later on the first of December, Concepción funicular opened, the first of many hydraulic systems. After the country's independence and its consequent openness to international trade, Valparaíso became an important port of call on trade routes through the Eastern Pacific. Many immigrants settled there, mostly from Europe and North America, who helped include Valparaíso and [[Chile]] in the [[Industrial Revolution]] sweeping other parts of the world. This created a different city with civil, financial, commercial and industrial institutions, many of which still exist today.

All this resulted in a population increases. The city reached more than 160,000 inhabitants in the late nineteenth century, making it necessary to use the steep hills for more houses, mansions and even cemeteries. The lack of available land caused the city authorities and developers to reclaim low lying tidal marshland (polders) upon which to build administrative, commercial and industrial infrastructure.

[[File:Titulares con que El Mercurio de Valparaíso informaba, el 14 de mayo de 1903, de lo ocurrido dos días antes..jpg|thumbnail|Headlines of {{Lang|es|[[El Mercurio de Valparaíso]]}} on 14 May 1903. In English, it reads:
{{quote|The Strike of the Seafarers. Fire of the South American Company. Assault on the printing press of ''El Mercurio''. Fire of the Malecon. Attitude of the Authority. The troops arrived from Santiago. The calm is restored. Meetings in the Municipality. It reaches an Arrangement. The Court of Appeals. The city in State of Siege.}} ''El Mercurio, 1903'']]
The twentieth century began with the first big protest of dockworkers, Chile on 15 April 1903, due to complaints by dockers about their excessive working hours and demands for higher wages, requests that were ignored by employers, creating a tense situation that led to serious violence on 12 May. There were protests and the burning of the [[CSAV]] offices and several people were shot and killed. All this prompted intervention by the state. This protest was important for the future of Trade Unionism in the country.
That same year, electric trams were introduced.

The [[1906 Valparaíso earthquake]] caused severe damage throughout the city on 16 August, which was at that time the heart of the Chilean economy. The damage was valued at hundreds of millions of pesos of the time, and human victims were counted at 3,000 dead and over 20,000 injured. After the removal of the debris, reconstruction work began. This included the widening of streets, culverting and covering streams, (Jaime and Delicias – creating the avenues Francia and Argentina respectively). The main street of the city (Pedro Montt) was laid and Plaza O'Higgins was created; a hill was removed to allow the passage of Colon Street. The damaged Edwards mansion was demolished and in its place, the present Cathedral of Valparaíso was built and, among many other works, this gave shape to the Almendral Valparaíso area.

In 1910, the port expansion work of the city, which ended in 1930, began. A long breakwater was built, along with piers and docking terminals.

The Imperial German East Asia Squadron engaged the British West Indies Squadron on 1 November 1914 at the [[Battle of Coronel]] off the coast of Valparaiso, sinking two British cruisers. After the battle the East Asia Squadron stayed in Valparaiso Harbor before continuing to the Falklands.

Chile's legislature along with other institutions of national importance like the National Customs Service, the National Fish and Aquaculture Ministry, the Ministry of Culture and the Barracks General of the [[Chilean Navy]] are sited in the city. In addition to the capital of the Valparaíso Region hosts the Regional Administration and government.

In 2003, Valparaíso became an [[UNESCO World Heritage Centre]]. This title was awarded to Valparaiso for its unique urban form, as well as its clear maintained historical background as a colorful port city. In becoming a World Heritage Center, Valparaíso is tasked with maintaining its cultural heritage, through the maintenance of its historic infrastructure, like its [[Valparaíso funiculars|Ascensores]].

On 13 April 2014, [[2014 Valparaíso wildfire|a huge brush fire]] burned out of control, destroying 2,800 homes and killing 16 people, forcing President [[Michelle Bachelet]] to declare it a disaster zone.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.businesslive.co.za/archive/2014-04-13-chile-declares-disaster-as-deadly-fire-storms-historic-port-city/ |title=Chile declares disaster as deadly fire storms historic port city |url-access=subscription |date=13 April 2014 |website=BusinessLIVE |language=en |access-date=11 February 2020 |archive-date=16 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210116092147/https://www.businesslive.co.za/archive/2014-04-13-chile-declares-disaster-as-deadly-fire-storms-historic-port-city/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{Moresources|section|date=July 2023}}
Valparaíso is located in central Chile, {{cvt|120|km|0}} to the north west of the capital [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. Valparaíso, like most of Chile, is vulnerable to earthquakes. Before the [[2010 Chile earthquake|earthquake of February 27, 2010]], which measured 8.8 on the [[moment magnitude scale]],<ref name="yahoo">{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20100227/wl_nm/us_quake_chile_29 |title=Massive earthquake hits Chile, 122 dead |publisher=Yahoo!

"Reconstructing the City, Constructing the State: Government in Valparaíso after the Earthquake of 1906", ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 87, no. 2: 221–254. Academic Search Premier, EBSCOhost (accessed September 13, 2008)</ref> Other significant earthquakes to affect the city were the [[1730 Valparaíso earthquake]] and the [[1985 Algarrobo earthquake]].

===Geology===
Because of Valparaíso's proximity to the [[Peru–Chile Trench]], the city is vulnerable to earthquakes. The Peru–Chile Trench stores large amounts of energy for a very long time and sometimes ruptures after short intervals in a violent earthquake.

===Climate===
Valparaíso has a very mild [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csb''). The summer is essentially dry, but the city is affected by fogs from the [[Humboldt Current]] during most of the year. In the winter, rainfall can occasionally be extremely heavy when a powerful frontal system crosses central Chile, but frequency of such rains varies greatly from year to year. Monthly average temperatures vary just around 6°C between the coolest and the warmest month, from {{cvt|17|C}} in January to {{cvt|11.4|C}} in July. Snowfall occurs rarely in the highest parts of the city. In winter, strong winds can lead to [[wind chill]] temperatures below freezing.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

Nicknamed "The Jewel of the Pacific", Valparaíso was declared a world heritage site based upon its improvised urban design and unique architecture. In 1996, the World Monuments Fund declared Valparaíso's unusual system of [[funicular]] lifts (steeply inclined carriages) one of the world's 100 most endangered historical treasures. In 1998, grassroots activists convinced the Chilean government and local authorities to apply for UNESCO world heritage status for Valparaíso. Valparaíso was declared a [[World Heritage Site#Chile|World Heritage Site]] in 2003. Built upon dozens of steep hillsides overlooking the Pacific Ocean, Valparaíso has a labyrinth of streets and cobblestone alleyways, embodying a rich architectural and cultural legacy. Valparaíso is protected as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].

Since its status as a World Heritage Site, Valparaíso has made several changes to its urban fabric in the process of maintaining its cultural heritage.

Landmarks include:
*[[Iglesia de la Matriz]]
*[[Plaza Aníbal Pinto]]
*[[Plaza Sotomayor]] including the [[Edificio Armada de Chile]]
*[[Edificio Luis Cousiño]]
*[[Palacio de los Tribunales de Justicia de Valparaíso|Courthouse]]
*16 remaining [[funicular]]s (called ascensores): 15 public (national monuments) and 1 private (which belongs to "Hospital Carlos Van Buren").<ref>See also [[Funicular railways of Valparaíso]] for the range of total numbers and active numbers, given from different sources.</ref>
*The Concepcion and Alegre historical district
*The Bellavista hill, which has the "Museo a Cielo Abierto" or "open air museum"
*Monument to [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Admiral Lord Thomas Alexander Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald]]
*Monument to [[Manuel Blanco Encalada]], first Chilean President

The [[Chilean Congress]] meets in a modern building in the Almendral section of Valparaíso, after relocation from Santiago during the last years of the dictatorship of General [[Augusto Pinochet]]. Although congressional activities were to be legally moved by a ruling in 1987, the newly built site only began to function as the seat of Congress during the government of [[Patricio Aylwin]] in 1990.

==Economy==
[[Image:Porto de Valparaiso - Chile - by Sérgio Schmiegelow.jpg|thumb|250px|Port of Valparaíso]] 
Major industries include tourism, culture, shipping and freight transport.

Approximately 50 international cruise ships call on Valparaíso during the 4-month Chilean summer. The port of Valparaíso is also an important hub for container freight and exports many products, including wine, copper, and fresh fruit.

[[File:Valparaíso Pullman trolleybus 715.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|One of the historic [[Trolleybuses in Valparaíso|trolleybus]]es that were still in daily service in 2019]]

A [[commuter rail]] service, the [[Valparaíso Metro]], opened to the public on 24 November 2005. The creation of this system involved updating parts of the Valparaíso-Santiago Railway, originally built in 1863. The Valparaíso Metro constitutes the so-called "fourth stage" ("Cuarta Etapa") of Metropolitan improvements. The Metro now connects the city core of Valparaíso with [[Viña del Mar]] and other cities. It extends along most of Gran Valparaíso, and is the second underground urban rail system in operation in Chile (after Santiago's), as it includes a tunnel section that crosses Viña del Mar's commercial district. The proposed [[Santiago–Valparaíso railway line]] would link Valparaíso and Santiago in around 45 minutes.

[[Public transport]] within Valparaíso itself is provided primarily by buses, [[trolleybus]]es and [[funicular]]s. The buses provide an efficient and regular service to and from the city centre and the numerous hills where most people live, as well as to neighbouring towns while more distant towns are served by long-distance [[Coach (bus)|coaches]]. Buses are operated by several private companies and regulated by the Regional Ministry of Transport, which controls fares and routes.<ref name="juts2009">Webb, Mary (ed.) (2009).

In addition, roads to link Valparaíso to San Antonio, Chile's second-largest port, and the coastal towns in between (Laguna Verde, Quintay, Algarrobo, and Isla Negra, for example), are also under construction. Travel between Valparaíso and Santiago takes about 80 minutes via a modern toll highway.

Internal passenger air services to Valparaíso are provided through the airport at [[Quintero]] which is some distance from the city but now served by good roads. The great majority of foreign visitors arrive through Santiago or on cruise liners.

===Funiculars===
{{Main|Funiculars of Valparaíso}}

Because of the slopes of the hills, many of the surrounding areas of Valparaíso are inaccessible by public transport. That is why "elevators" serve the function of communicating the high part of the city with the [[Plan de Valparaíso|plan]], besides being a strong holiday highlight. The only [[elevator]] that can truly be called as such, is the ''[[Polanco Lift|Ascensor Polanco]]'', because it is vertical. Meanwhile, the rest are cable cars but traditionally called elevators. Several of those [[funicular]]s – locally called ''ascensores'' – provide public transport service between the central area and the lower slopes of the surrounding hills,<ref name="juts2009"/> the first of which ([[Ascensor Concepción]], also known as Ascensor Turri) opened in 1883, operated by steam, is still in service.<ref name="merc-4Apr2019-ascensor">{{cite news |last1=Paredas R. |first1=Alexis |title=El ascensor más antiguo del Puerto reabre con marcha blanca y gratuito |trans-title=The oldest funicular in Valparaíso reopens with commissioning and free service |language=es |url=http://www.mercuriovalpo.cl/impresa/2019/04/04/full/cuerpo-principal/4/ |access-date=2019-04-07 |work=[[El Mercurio de Valparaíso|El Mercurio]] |date=4 April 2019 |page=4 |archive-date=2019-04-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404132107/http://www.mercuriovalpo.cl/impresa/2019/04/04/full/cuerpo-principal/4/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="morrison">Morrison, Allen (1992).

[[File:Ascensor Conception.jpg|thumb|Ascensor Conception- built 1883]]
Valparaíso has fifteen lifts declared Historical Monuments by the National Monuments Council. Five are municipal property and the remaining belong to four private companies. The elevators are elevators municipal Baron, El Peral, Polanco, Queen Victoria and St. Augustine. As for the rest, lifts Florida, Butterflies and Nuns are owned by the National Elevator Company SA; Artillery, Concepción and Mountains belong to the Society of Mechanical Lifts Valparaíso Holy Spirit, Larraín and Villaseca (stopped for repairs) are the property of Valparaíso Elevators Company SA, and Dairy (stopped by fire) belongs to the Society of Dairy Cerro Lifts Ltd.

As a part of its 2003 declaration as a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]], Valparaíso has promised to replace and maintain its several funiculars. The funiculars were identified as an important cultural artifact.

===Port of Valparaíso===
The port of Valparaíso is divided into ten sites which sites 1,2,3,4 and 5 are administered by ''South Pacific Terminal SA and sites 6,7,8,9 and 10 for Valparaíso Port Company''. The last two sites include a dock and are used as public walks and cruise passenger terminal.

Valparaíso is the main container and passenger port in [[Chile]], transferring 10&nbsp;million tons annually, and serves about 50 cruises and 150,000 passengers.

==Culture==
[[File:BibSeverin02.jpg|thumb|[[Biblioteca Santiago Severín]]]]
During Valparaíso's golden age (1848–1914), the city received large numbers of immigrants, primarily from Europe.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thisischile.cl/people/migration/?lang=en |title=Immigration |date=2014-03-11 |website=This is Chile |language=en-US |access-date=2019-02-20 |archive-date=2019-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190221112024/https://www.thisischile.cl/people/migration/?lang=en |url-status=dead }}</ref> The immigrant communities left a unique imprint on the city's noteworthy architecture. Each community built its own churches and schools, while many also founded other noteworthy cultural and economic institutions. The largest immigrant communities came from Britain, Germany, and Italy, each developing their own hillside neighbourhood, preserved today as National Historic Districts or "Zonas Típicas".

[[File:Arco Británico.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arco Británico]]]]
During the second half of the 20th century, Valparaíso experienced a great decline, as wealthy families de-gentrified the historic quarter, moving to bustling Santiago or nearby Viña del Mar. By the early 1990s, much of the city's unique heritage had been lost and many Chileans had given up on the city. But in the mid-1990s, a grassroots preservation movement blossomed in Valparaíso where nowadays also a vast number of murals created by graffiti artists can be viewed on the streets, alleyways and stairways.

''The Fundación Valparaíso'' (Valparaíso Foundation), founded by the North American poet [[Todd Temkin]], has executed major neighborhood redevelopment projects; has improved the city's tourist infrastructure; and administers the city's jazz, ethnic music, and opera festivals; among other projects. Some noteworthy foundation projects include the World Heritage Trail,<ref name="senderobicentenario">{{cite web |url=http://www.senderobicentenario.cl/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040805121740/http://www.senderobicentenario.cl/ |archive-date=2004-08-05 |url-status=dead |title=Sendero Bicentenario |access-date=2014-05-24}}</ref> Opera by the Sea,<ref name="operaenelmar">{{cite web |url=http://www.operaenelmar.cl/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021212726/http://www.operaenelmar.cl/ |archive-date=2006-10-21 |url-status=dead |title=Ópera en el Mar |access-date=2014-05-24}}</ref> and Chile's "Cultural Capital".<ref>{{cite web |author=AyerViernes S.A. |url=http://www.capitalcultural.cl/ |title=Capital Cultural |publisher=Capitalcultural.cl |access-date=2011-04-17 |archive-date=2011-07-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707005854/http://www.capitalcultural.cl/ |url-status=live }}</ref> During recent years, Mr. Temkin has used his influential Sunday column in El Mercurio de Valparaíso to advocate for many major policy issues, such as the creation of a "Ley Valparaíso" (Valparaíso Law) in the Chilean Congress, and the possibility that the Chilean government must guarantee funding for the preservation of Valparaíso's beloved funicular elevators.

Valparaíso's newspaper, {{Lang|es|[[El Mercurio de Valparaíso]]}} is the oldest Spanish-language newspaper in circulation in the world.

Valparaíso is also home to the so-called "School of Valparaíso", which is in fact the Faculty of Architecture & Urbanism of the [[Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso]]. The "School of Valparaíso" was in the 1960s and 1970s one of the most experimental, avant-garde and controversial Architectural schools in the country.

Valparaíso stages a major festival attended by hundreds of thousands of participants on the last three days of every year. The festival culminates with a "New Year's by the Sea" [[fireworks]] show, the biggest in all of Latin America, attended by a million tourists who fill the coastline and hillsides with a view of the bay. Even though everyone calls it the Valparaíso Fireworks, it is, in fact, a fireworks display running along a great part of the coast from Valparaíso, past Viña del Mar and all the way to Concón.

In 2003, the Chilean Congress declared Valparaíso to be "Chile's Cultural Capital" and home for the nation's new cultural ministry.

Valparaíso offers various urban nightlife activities. Traditional bars and nightclubs can be found near Plaza Sotomayor. A vivid guide to Valparaíso can be found in the novels of [[Cayetano Brule]], the private detective who lives in a Victorian house in the picturesque Paseo Gervasoni in [[Cerro Concepción]].

==Health system==
The public healthcare system mainly relies on the [[Hospital Carlos Van Buren]] located at the plan and Hospital Valparaíso (officially Hospital Eduardo Pereira) located at St. Roque Hill. There are also several clinics like [[Universidad de Chile]]'s Clinica Barón, Hospital Aleman (due to close), and the former Naval Hospital on Playa Ancha Hill.

==Sports==
Valparaíso has several public sports venues and facilities, including a growing network of cycle routes.<ref>[http://www.ciudaddevalparaiso.cl/FCKeditor/UserFiles/Image/ESTRUCTURA_WEB_OFICIAL/TURISMO/ACTIVIDADES/Deportes/ciclovias_grande.jpg Cycle rout] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306231307/http://www.ciudaddevalparaiso.cl/FCKeditor/UserFiles/Image/ESTRUCTURA_WEB_OFICIAL/TURISMO/ACTIVIDADES/Deportes/ciclovias_grande.jpg |date=2014-03-06 }} ciudaddevalparaiso.cl retrieved on February 07, 2014</ref>
