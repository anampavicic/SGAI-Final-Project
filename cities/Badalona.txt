'''Badalona''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|æ|d|ə|ˈ|l|oʊ|n|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|USalso|ˌ|b|ɑː|d|-}}, {{IPA|ca|bəðəˈlonə|lang}}, {{IPA|es|baðaˈlona|lang}}) is a [[Municipalities of Spain|municipality]] in [[Barcelonès]] county, in [[Catalonia]] ([[Spain]]). It is located to the north east of [[Barcelona]], on the left bank of the [[Besòs River]] and on the [[Mediterranean Sea]], in the [[Barcelona metropolitan area]]. By population, it is the third largest city in Catalonia and the [[Ranked lists of Spanish municipalities|twenty-third in Spain]]. It became a city in 1897.

== Names ==
The name Badalona comes from ancient Iberian word ''Baitolo'' according to the legend of several bronze coins of the end of the 2nd century BC found in the city.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Baitolo|url=http://hesperia.ucm.es/consulta_hesperia/numismatica/lengua.php?id=37|access-date=27 July 2020|website=Hesperia. Banco de datos de lenguas paleohispánicas}}</ref> This word was the origin of the [[Latin]] name ''Baetulo'' that was as the Romans named the new city they founded off the coast of present Badalona. The oldest mention of the name Baetulo is from ''De Chorographia'' of [[Pomponius Mela]] (43–44 AD),{{Sfn|Villarroya Font|1999|p=27}} who use the same name for the [[Besòs (river)|Besòs river]] (named ''Bissaucio'' during the Middle Ages).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Negre Pastell|first=Pelai|date=1946|title=Los nombres primitivos de los ríos Muga, Fluviá y Ter: contribución al estudio de la geografia antigua de Cataluña|url=http://www.raco.cat/index.php/AnnalsGironins/article/view/53331/63885|journal=Annals de l'Institut d'Estudis Gironins|volume=1|pages=177–208}}</ref> Following the Roman era, during the [[High Middle Ages]] the name ''Baetulo'' evolved to ''Bitulona'', which was the most common name but not the only one, because it is found in the Latin written documents other versions as ''Bedelona'', ''Bitilona'', ''Betulona'', ''Bedalona'' and even ''Vitulona''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Richaud López|first=Inmaculada|date=2020|title=El vicus Bitulone: redescobrint la Badalona altmedieval (segles X, XI i XII)|url=https://www.museudebadalona.cat/wp-content/uploads/revista-Carrer-dels-Arbres-n%C3%BAm-5-2020.pdf|journal=Carrer dels Arbres.

==History==
The oldest traces of settlement date from the [[Neolithic]] (about 3500–2500 BC). Archaeological finds consisting of carved stone and flint tools have been discovered in the Seriol hill and Manresà areas along with tombs with grave goods in the quarters of Sistrells and Llefià. Deposits from the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]] have been found in old brickyards (dated about 1800–1500 BC) and in the [[Masia|''masies'']] of [[Can Butinyà]] and [[Can Mora]] in the [[Canyet]] quarter (1500–1100 BC).{{Sfn|Villarroya Font|1999|p=21}}

Before the Roman settlement of Hispania, the territory of Badalona was populated by Iberians who lived on the Boscà hill (198 metres above the sea level), from where it is possible to see the coastline. The settlement dates to at least the 4th century BC but was totally abandoned by the 1st century AD due to [[Romanization of Hispania|Romanization]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Generalitat de Catalunya|title=Turó d'en Boscà|url=http://invarque.cultura.gencat.cat/Fitxa?index=0&consulta=&codi=9535|access-date=28 July 2020|website=Inventari del patrimoni arqueològic i paleontològic de Catalunya}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Grup Enciclopèdia Catalana|title=Turó d'en Boscà|url=https://www.enciclopedia.cat/ec-gec-0247240.xml|access-date=28 July 2020|website=Gran Enciclopèdia Catalana}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Guitart Duran|first1=Josep|last2=Padrós Martí|first2=Pepita|date=1987|title=El poblat ibèric del turó d'en Boscà|url=https://www.raco.cat/index.php/CarrerArbres/article/view/294952/383589|journal=Carrer dels Arbres. Revista anuari del Museu de Badalona|volume=2|issue=3|pages=28–33}}</ref> Despite the presence of the Iberians, the city's origins are usually dated to around the year 100 BC, when the Romans founded a city ''ex novo'' on Rosés hill (26,8 metres) next to the coast. The Roman town plan was based on their common scheme of the ''[[cardo]]'' and ''[[Decumanus Maximus|decumanus]]'', occupying some 10&nbsp;ha, with a line of walls. The Roman city was very dynamic, especially during the reign of [[Augustus]], with a specialised viniculture that produced wine for export all over the empire. From the 3rd century, the city went into decline and was almost depopulated as people fled to rustic [[Villa rustica|''villae'']].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Guitart Duran|first=Josep|title=La ciutat romana de Baetulo (Badalona) Historia i urbanisme|url=https://www.raco.cat/index.php/Espais/article/view/91382/159223|journal=Espais: Revista del Departament de Política Territorial i Obres Públiques|date=15 January 1991|volume=31|pages=50–56}}</ref> However, the few remains from [[Late antiquity]] prove that Baetulo was never abandoned.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Padrós Martí|first1=Pepita|last2=Nieto Sabater|first2=Maria Dolors|date=2016|title=Santa Maria de Badalona.

The current city of Badalona was formed in the 10th century when a new urban nucleus was built over the old Roman city and around the old forum and temple, which was turned into a [[Santa Maria of Badalona|church]].<ref name=":0" /> At the same time, a rural nucleus emerged outside the town walls. This rural-urban dichotomy would remain until the mid-18th century.

[[Sant Jeroni de la Murtra Monastery]], built in the 14th century, is where the [[Catholic Monarchs]] would spend their summers. According to some authors, this is also where they received [[Christopher Columbus]] after his first voyage to the Americas.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Permanyer Lladós|first=Lluís|date=23 December 1992|title=El discreto viaje de Colón|work=La Vanguardia|url=http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1992/12/23/pagina-2/33532221/pdf.html|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aymar Ragolta|first=Jaume|date=1993|title=L'estada dels Reis Catòlics a Barcelona el 1493|url=http://www.cecolom.cat/documents/butlleti09.pdf|journal=Butlletí del Centre d'Estudis Colombins|volume=9|pages=10–12|via=}}</ref>

During the first half of the 19th century, Badalona remained an agricultural and fishing centre. However, this changed in 1848 with the construction of the railway connecting the cities of [[Mataró]] and [[Barcelona]], which brought a station to the village.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Badalona|url=http://www.enciclopedia.cat/ec-gec-0006584.xml|website=Gran Enciclopèdia Catalana}}</ref> This furthered the industrialization and economic development of Badalona and led to the progressive decline of the traditional economic sectors. Due to the arrival of new industries, Badalona also became an important centre of the [[labour movement]].<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Albaladejo|first1=Jordi|url=http://www.cedall.org/Documentacio/Moviment%20obrer%20a%20Badalona/Joan%20Peiro/JOAN_PEIRO_A_BADALONA.pdf|title=Inicis d'un sindicalista llibertari: Joan Peiró a Badalona|last2=Zambrana|first2=Joan|publisher=Edicions fet a mà|year=2003|location=Badalona}}</ref> Thanks to this, the village began to attract newcomers, doubling its population from 5,733 (1851) to 10,485 (1857). By the end of the century Badalona had around 19.000 inhabitants.{{Sfn|Villarroya Font|1999|p=103-107}} The demographic growth gave rise to urban development with an ''[[ensanche]]'' plan covering all along the coast from [[Sant Adrià de Besòs|Sant Adrià]] to [[Montgat]]. In 1897, the city received the title of city from the queen regent [[Maria Christina of Austria]].<ref name=":1" />

The city's demographic growth continued mostly uncontrolled in the first third of the 20th century. This entailed the construction of new neighbourhoods without urban infrastructure and poor connections to the city centre.{{Sfn|Villarroya Font|1999|p=164-167}} During the [[dictatorship of Primo de Rivera]] the city council tried to alleviate these problems by developing infrastructure, building a new school, market and slaughterhouse and expanding the sewage network; however, this was not enough.{{Sfn|Villarroya Font|1999|p=163}} During the Second Republic, Badalona was often in turmoil, as would be the case during the civil war, when the city was bombed due to its importance as an industrial centre.{{Sfn|Villarroya Font|1999|p=205}} After the end of the war, in 1940, the mayor [[Frederic Xifré]] was executed by the Francoists.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Albadalejo Blanco|first=Jordi|date=2009|title=Frederic Xifré|work=Revista de Badalona|issue=693|url=http://es.calameo.com/read/000357579e60e09635788}}</ref>

[[Francoist Spain|Franco's dictatorship]] brought about the decline of Badalona's varied pre-war cultural life. The period was also marked by the arrival of immigrants, mainly from the south of Spain, which further accelerated the city's demographic growth, precipitating the emergence of [[Shanty town|shanty towns]] with unhealthy conditions. The city's population increased from 92,200 in 1960 to 201,200 only fifteen years later.{{Sfn|Villarroya Font|1999|p=150-151}} During the mandate of mayor [[Felipe Antoja]], the city received poor migrants from Barcelona who lived in shanties; with the creation of poor neighbourhoods, Badalona had some of the lowest-quality housing in the country. Urban expansion also disturbed historical buildings and archaeological sites.{{Sfn|Villarroya Font|1999|p=222-223}}

After the death of Franco, and especially from 1979, the city found a new social vitality through the organised neighbours’ movement, which fought to improve infrastructure in their neighbourhoods, to combat real estate speculation, and to obtain urban improvements.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Baeza|first=Josep|title=Associacionisme veïnal a Badalona|publisher=Federació d'Associacions de Veïns de Badalona|year=1998|location=Badalona|pages=28}}</ref> On 29 January 1976, Badalona held the first protest to be tolerated without violence from the Spanish authorities in the post-Franco era.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Muñoz|first=Sara|date=1 March 2016|title=La primera 'mani' sense bufetades|work=El Punt Avui|url=http://www.elpuntavui.cat/societat/article/945926-la-primera-lmani-sense-bufetades.html}}</ref> The city has also gone through a transformation from an industrial to a service economy.<ref name=":1" /> Badalona was a subsite of the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympic Games]], hosting the basketball and boxing competitions.{{Sfn|Villarroya Font|1999|p=173, 181}} Though Badalona is included in the Barcelona conurbation, it maintains its own identity, especially in the central neighbourhoods.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Bassas|first=Antoni|date=10 May 2015|title=Badalona, tercera ciutat de Catalunya|work=Ara|url=https://www.ara.cat/suplements/Tercera-catalunya-IDENTITAT-centre-barris_0_1354664539.html}}</ref>

==Economy==
The economy of Badalona is mainly based on the service sector, although traditionally was an important industrial centre. The primary sector as agriculture and fishing were also remarkable. However, those activities declined throughout the 20th century. In 2017 Badalona's GDP worth 4.122,9&nbsp;million Euros,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Institut d'Estadística de Catalunya|date=2018|title=PIB.
