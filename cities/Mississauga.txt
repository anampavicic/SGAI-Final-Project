'''Mississauga''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=mississauga.ogg|ˌ|m|ɪ|s|ɪ|ˈ|s|ɔː|ɡ|ə}} {{respell|MISS|iss|AW|gə}})<ref>[[Dictionary.com|Dictionary Reference]]: [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Mississauga Mississauga], [[TheFreeDictionary.com|The Free Dictionary]]: [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Mississauga Mississauga]</ref> is a Canadian city in the province of [[Ontario]]. Situated on the western shore of [[Lake Ontario]] in the [[Regional Municipality of Peel]], it borders [[Toronto]] ([[Etobicoke]]) to the east, [[Brampton]] to the north, [[Milton, Ontario|Milton]] to the northwest, and [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]] to the southwest. Although Mississauga was initially a [[Car dependency|car-centric]] city, significant strides have been made to improve walkability and add cycling lanes, with most major arteries having bi-directional [[Bike lane|bike lanes]]. [[Mississauga City Centre|The city's downtown]] is home to several transit hubs, such as [[Square One Bus Terminal]], and the City Centre Transit Terminal. With a population of 717,961 as of 2021, Mississauga is the [[list of the largest municipalities in Canada by population|seventh-most populous municipality in Canada]], [[list of cities in Ontario|third-most in Ontario]], and [[list of municipalities in the Greater Toronto Area|second-most]] in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] (GTA) after Toronto itself.<ref name=Census2016>{{SCref |unit=csd |code=3521005|year=2016}}</ref><ref name=2011census>{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3521005&Geo2=CD&Code2=3521&Data=Count&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All|title=Mississauga, City Ontario (Census Subdivision)|work=Census Profile|publisher=[[Statistics Canada]]|date=8 February 2012|access-date=2012-02-08}}</ref> However, for the first time in its history, the city's population declined according to the 2021 census, from a 2016 population of 721,599 to 717,961, a 0.5 per cent decrease.<ref name="2021Census" />

The growth of Mississauga was initially attributed to its proximity to [[Toronto]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/analysis/popdwell/Subprov4.cfm|title=Three large urban areas: the Montreal and Vancouver CMAs and the Greater Golden Horseshoe|work=[[Statistics Canada]], 2007 Census of Population|quote=Mississauga (668,549), a suburb of Toronto...|date=13 March 2007|access-date=2007-03-22|archive-date=15 March 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315195135/http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/analysis/popdwell/Subprov4.cfm|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, during the latter half of the 20th century, the city attracted a diverse and multicultural population. Over time, it built up a thriving, [[Transit-oriented development|transit-oriented]] [[central business district]] of its own, which is now known as [[Mississauga City Centre]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www6.mississauga.ca/onlinemaps/planbldg/images/DT21/Downtown21_FINAL_2010-04-08_web.pdf|title=Downtown21 Master Plan|work=City of Mississauga|date=April 2010|access-date=2013-04-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.placestogrow.ca/cities/mississauga.php|title=Mississauga City Centre Urban Growth Centre|work=Government of Ontario|access-date=2013-04-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402155700/https://www.placestogrow.ca/cities/mississauga.php|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Malton, Mississauga|Malton]], a neighbourhood of the city located in its northeast end, is home to [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]], Canada's busiest airport, as well as [[List of corporations based in Mississauga|the headquarters of many Canadian and multinational corporations]]. Mississauga is not a traditional city, but is instead an [[Merger (politics)|amalgamation]] of three former villages, two townships, and a number of rural hamlets (a general pattern common to several suburban GTA cities) that were significant population centres, with none being clearly dominant, prior to the city's incorporation that later coalesced into a single urban area.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Founding Villages – Heritage Mississauga|url=https://heritagemississauga.com/founding-villages/|access-date=2020-08-20|language=en-US}}</ref>

Indigenous people have lived in the area for thousands of years and Mississauga is situated on the traditional territory of the [[Huron-Wendat Nation|Huron-Wendat]], [[Haudenosaunee]] and [[Anishinaabe]]g people, including the namesake [[Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation|Mississaugas]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Mississauga {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/mississauga|access-date=2021-06-16|website=Thecanadianencyclopedia.ca}}</ref> Most of present-day Mississauga was founded in 1805 as [[Toronto Township, Ontario|Toronto Township]]<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Mississauga |url=http://www5.mississauga.ca/rec&parks/websites/museums/pdfs/history_of_mississauga.pdf |access-date=7 June 2022 |website=5.mississauga.ca}}</ref> within [[York County, Ontario|York County]], and became part of [[Peel County, Ontario|Peel County]] when new counties were formed by splitting off parts of the original county in 1851. Mississauga itself was established in 1968 as a town, and was reincorporated as a city in 1974, when Peel was restructured into a [[regional municipality]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://peelarchivesblog.com/about-peel/|title=About Peel|website=Peelarchivesblog.com|date=8 May 2015|access-date=7 June 2022}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Mississauga'' comes from the [[Anishinaabe]] word {{lang|oj|Misi-zaagiing}}, meaning "[Those at the] Great River-mouth".

Other forms such as ''Sauga'' and, in reference to the city's residents, ''Saugans'',<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.yoursauga.com/major-league-baseball-drafts-two-mississauga-natives/ |title=Major League Baseball drafts two Mississauga natives |last=Kucharski |first=Monica |date=2018-06-14 |website=Yoursauga.com |language=en-CA |access-date=2020-03-30 |archive-date=30 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200330025906/https://www.yoursauga.com/major-league-baseball-drafts-two-mississauga-natives/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> and ''Mississaugans'',<ref name="Demonym" /> are also commonly used.

==History==
{{See also|List of historic places in Mississauga}}

=== Palaeo-Indigenous period (9000–8500 BCE) ===
A single site in Mississauga with Hi-Lo projectile points<ref>{{Cite web|title=HI-LO – Ontario Archaeological Society: London Chapter|url=http://oaslondonchapter.ca/hi-lo/|access-date=2021-10-16|language=en-US}}</ref> was registered in the [[Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries (Ontario)|Ontario Ministry of Culture]] database of archaeological sites.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Smith|first=David G.|title=Mississauga: The First 10,000 Years|publisher=Eastendbooks|year=2002|isbn=1-896973-28-0|editor-last=Dieterman|editor-first=Frank A.|location=Toronto|pages=55–72|chapter=Ten Thousand Years}}</ref> Lake Ontario was much smaller at this time, and sites from this period may be 500 m into the lake.<ref name=":1" />

=== Archaic period (8000–1000 BCE) ===
According to Smith,<ref name=":1" /> there was a growing population at this time. There are 23 known Archaic sites in Mississauga, mostly in the [[Credit River]] and [[Cooksville Creek]] drainage systems. People would congregate at rapids and the mouths of these rivers to catch fish during spawning runs. They would harvest nuts and wild rice at the wetland margins in the late summer. During late Archaic times, there were large cemeteries.<ref name=":1" />

=== Woodland period (1000 BCE–1650 CE) ===
"The accelerating upward population increase continued,"<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|62|quote-page=62}} with 23 known sites from this period. Pottery first appears during this period in the style of the [[Point Peninsula complex]], and near the end of the Woodland period, the first semi-permanent villages appear. Artifacts show that residents of Mississauga engaged in long-distance trade, likely as part of the [[Hopewell tradition]].<ref name=":1" />

==== Late Woodland culture (500–1650 CE) ====
"The band level of social organization that characterized earlier cultures gave way eventually to the tribal level of the Ontario [[Iroquois|Iroquoian]] Tradition,"<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|67|quote-page=67}} and people began cultivation of crops such as [[maize]], beans, squash, sunflowers, and tobacco. This led to the development of the [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] or Huron, [[Iroquoian]]-speaking culture. The Lightfoot site with four to six [[Longhouses of the indigenous peoples of North America|longhouses]] was located on the Credit River near Mississauga's border with Brampton. Another village with many longhouses was on the Antrex site, located on a wide ridge bounded by two small tributaries of Cooksville Creek.<ref name=":1" />

=== Arrival of the Haudenosaunee, the Anishinaabe, and the Europeans ===
Around the end of the Woodland period, the Haudenosaunee, another Iroquoian confederacy, began to move into the area, and, as part of a long conflict known as the [[Beaver Wars|Beaver wars]], they had dispersed the Wyandot by 1650.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|last=Smith|first=Donald B.|title=Mississauga: The First 10,000 Years|publisher=Eastendbooks|year=2002|isbn=1-896973-28-0|editor-last=Dieterman|editor-first=Frank A.|location=Toronto|pages=107–119|chapter=Their century and a half on the Credit: The Mississaugas in Mississauga}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Huron-Wendat {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/huron|access-date=2021-10-16|website=Thecanadianencyclopedia.ca}}</ref> But by 1687, the Haudenosaunee had abandoned their new settlements along the north shore of Lake Ontario.<ref name=":3" />{{Rp|page=65}}

The [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking [[Anishinaabe]] [[Ojibwe]] people had been aligned with the Wyandot, and when they were dispersed, the Anishinaabe expanded eastward into the [[Credit River|Credit River Valley]] area, clashing with the Haudenosaunee and eventually taking over when the Haudenosaunee retreated.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|last=McDonnell|first=Michael A.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/932060403|title=Masters of empire : Great Lakes Indians and the making of America|date=2016|isbn=978-0-8090-6800-5|location=New York|oclc=932060403 }}</ref> The European traders would gather annually at the mouth of what is now known as the Credit River to give the Anishinaabe credit for the following year. "From this, the [[Mississaugas|Mississauga]] bands at the western end of the lake became known collectively as the Credit River Mississaugas."<ref name=":2" />{{Rp|108|quote-page=108}}

[[Toronto Township, Ontario|Toronto Township]], consisting of most of present-day Mississauga, was formed on 2 August 1805 {{citation needed|date=June 2021|reason=to confirm date}} when officials from York (what is now the City of Toronto) purchased 85,000&nbsp;acres (340&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of land from the [[Mississaugas]] under Treaty 14.<ref name=":0" /> A second treaty was signed in 1818 that surrendered 2,622&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of Mississauga land to the [[The Crown|British Crown]]. In total Mississauga is covered by four treaties: Treaty 14, Treaty 19, Treaty 22 and Treaty 23.<ref name=":0" />

The original villages (and some later incorporated towns) settled included [[Clarkson, Mississauga|Clarkson]], [[Cooksville, Ontario|Cooksville]], Dixie, Erindale (called Springfield until 1890), [[Lakeview, Mississauga|Lakeview]], [[Lorne Park]], [[Port Credit, Ontario|Port Credit]], Sheridan, and Summerville. The region became known as Toronto Township. Part of northeast Mississauga, including the Airport lands and [[Malton, Mississauga|Malton]] were a part of [[Toronto Gore Township]].<ref name=history>{{cite web|url=http://www.mississauga.ca/portal/discover/historyandheritage|title=Mississauga Heritage|publisher=City of Mississauga|access-date=2006-04-24}}</ref>

After the land was surveyed, the Crown gave much of it in the form of land grants to [[United Empire Loyalists]] who emigrated from the [[Thirteen Colonies]] during and after the [[American Revolution]], as well as loyalists from New Brunswick. A group of settlers from New York City arrived in the 1830s. The government wanted to compensate the Loyalists for property lost in the colonies and encourage development of what was considered frontier. In 1820, the government purchased additional land from the Mississaugas. Additional settlements were established, including: Barbertown, Britannia, Burnhamthorpe, [[Churchville, Brampton|Churchville]], Derry West, [[Elmbank, Ontario|Elmbank]], Malton, [[Meadowvale Village|Meadowvale]] (Village), Mount Charles, and [[Streetsville, Ontario|Streetsville]]. European-Canadian settlement led to the eventual displacement of the Mississaugas. In 1847, the government relocated them to [[New Credit|a reserve]] in the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River Valley]], near present-day [[Hagersville, Ontario|Hagersville]].<ref name=MississaugaCityHistory>{{cite web|title=City History|url=http://carlwalwyn.com/city-history|access-date=26 September 2014|archive-date=26 September 2014|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140926195226/http://carlwalwyn.com/city-history|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Part One 1819–1850|url=http://www.mississauga.ca/file/COM/9661_MeadowvaleBook_PartOne.pdf|access-date=25 September 2014}}</ref> Pre-confederation, the Township of Toronto was formed as a local government; settlements within were not legal villages until much later. Except for small villages, some [[gristmill]]s and [[brickworks]] served by railway lines, most of present-day Mississauga was agricultural land, including fruit orchards, through much of the 19th and first half of the 20th century.<ref name="Mississauga Real Estate">{{cite web|title=Mississauga Real Estate|url=http://www5.mississauga.ca/rec&parks/websites/museums/pdfs/history_of_mississauga.pdf|access-date=25 September 2014}}</ref><ref name="Heritage Mississauga">{{cite web|title=Heritage Mississauga – History|url=http://www.heritagemississauga.com/page/History|access-date=26 September 2014}}</ref>

=== 1900 to today ===
In the 1920s, cottages were constructed along the shores of [[Lake Ontario]] as weekend getaway houses for city dwellers.

In 1937, 1,410.8&nbsp;acres of land was sold to build [[Malton Airport]] (later known as Pearson Airport). It became Canada's busiest airport which later put the end to the community of Elmbank.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Dave|title=Fading History Vol. 2|year=2010|publisher=David L.

The [[Queen Elizabeth Way]] (QEW) highway, one of the first [[controlled-access highway]]s in the world, opened from [[Ontario Highway 27|Highway 27]] to [[Ontario Highway 10|Highway 10]] in [[Port Credit, Ontario|Port Credit]], in 1935 and later expanded to Hamilton and Niagara in 1939. The first prototypical suburban developments occurred around the same time, in the area south of the Dixie Road/QEW interchange. Development in general moved north and west from there over time and around established communities. In 1952, Toronto Township annexed the southern portion of Toronto Gore Township.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hicks|first=Kathleen A.|title=Malton: Farms to Flying ''P. 173'' |publisher=Friends of the Mississauga Library System|year=2005|url=http://www.mississauga.ca/file/COM/9634_MaltonBook.pdf}}</ref> Two large [[new towns]]; [[Erin Mills]] and (New) [[Meadowvale, Ontario|Meadowvale]], were started in 1968 and 1969, respectively.  
[[File:Mississauga Historic Municipalities.png|thumb|The areas amalgamated to create the present city: The Town of Mississauga ''(red)'', was created out of Toronto Township, which in 1952 annexed a portion of Toronto Gore Township ''(right of dashed white line)''. In 1968 (the year of its incorporation), the police village of Malton ''(white outline)'' was absorbed into it. The town became a city in 1974, and absorbed Port Credit, Streetsville, and a portion of Milton ''(beige)'', but ceded the northern extremity ''(separated section of red at top)'' to Brampton. A final annexation occurred in 2010, when a thin strip of land was purchased from Milton ''(blue)'' to bring the city limits to Hwy. 407.]]    
While the Township had many settlements within it, none of the hamlets were legally existent, and all residents were represented by a singular Township council (Malton had special status as a [[police village]], allowing it partial autonomy). To reflect the community's shift away from rural to urban, council desired conversion into a town, and in 1965 a call for public input on naming it received thousands of letters offering hundreds of different suggestions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mississauga.com/news-story/8033098-leepkroy-xebec-weird-names-mississauga-could-have-been-called/|title=Leepkroy?

Port Credit and [[Streetsville]] remained separate, uninterested in ceding their autonomy or being taxed to the needs of a growing municipality. Political will, as well as a belief that a larger city would be a hegemony in Peel County, kept Port Credit and Streetsville as independent [[enclaves]] within the Town of Mississauga, but both were amalgamated into Mississauga when it reincorporated as a city in 1974. At this time, Mississauga annexed lands west of [[Winston Churchill Boulevard]] from [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]] in the northwest,{{efn|The unannexed portion of northern Oakville became part of Milton on the same day}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://heritagemississauga.com/lost-villages/ |title=Preserve Our Heritage: ''Lost Villages'' |work=Heritage Mississauga |publisher=Mississauga Heritage Foundation |access-date=August 12, 2020}}</ref> in exchange for lands in the northernmost extremity (which included Churchville) south of [[Steeles Avenue]] which were transferred to [[Brampton]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.bramptonguardian.com/living-story/5763940-brampton-s-historic-churchville-village-turns-200/| work=Pam Douglas |title=Brampton's historic Churchville village turns 200|date=July 28, 2015 |publisher=Brampton Guardian |access-date=August 12, 2020}}</ref> That year, [[Square One Shopping Centre]] opened; it has since expanded several times.<ref>{{cite web|title=1968&nbsp;– Amalgamation to form the Town of Mississauga|url=http://www5.mississauga.ca//library/SRC/MM1968_Amalgamation.html|website=Mississauga.ca|access-date=24 August 2014}}</ref>

On 10 November 1979, [[1979 Mississauga train derailment|a 106-car freight train derailed]] on the CP rail line while carrying explosive and poisonous chemicals just north of the intersection of Mavis Road and [[Dundas Street (Ontario)|Dundas Street]]. One of the tank cars carrying [[propane]] exploded, and since other tank cars were carrying chlorine, the decision was made to evacuate nearby residents. With the possibility of a deadly cloud of chlorine gas spreading through Mississauga, 218,000 people were evacuated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mississauga Train Derailment|url=http://www.mississauga.ca/portal/residents/derailmentgallery|website=Mississauga.ca|access-date=14 September 2011}}</ref> Residents were allowed to return home once the site was deemed safe. At the time, it was the largest peacetime evacuation in North American history. Due to the speed and efficiency with which it was conducted, many cities later studied and modelled their own emergency plans after Mississauga's. For many years afterwards, the name "Mississauga" was, for Canadians, associated with a major rail disaster.<ref name="Mississauga train derailment">{{cite web|title=Mississauga train derailment, November 10, 1979|url=http://www.carterrv.com/stead/1979/1979.htm|access-date=25 September 2014}}</ref>

North American telephone customers placing calls to Mississauga (and other post-1970 Ontario cities) may not recognise the charge details on their bills. The area's [[incumbent local exchange carrier]], [[Bell Canada]], continues to split the city into five historical rate centres–Clarkson, Cooksville, Malton, Port Credit, and Streetsville. However, they are combined as a single Mississauga listing in the phone book. The first [[Dual-tone multi-frequency signalling|Touch-Tone]] telephones in Canada were introduced in Malton on 15 June 1964.<ref name="Hicks Malton">{{cite book|last=Hicks|first=Kathleen A.|title=Malton: Farms to Flying|year=2006|publisher=Friends of the Mississauga Library System|location=Mississauga|page=105|isbn=978-0-9697873-9-6}}</ref>

Mississauga covers {{convert|288.42|km2}} of land,<ref name=census>{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3521005&Geo2=PR&Code2=35&Data=Count&SearchText=Mississauga&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom= |title=Community Profile, City of Mississauga |work=[[Statistics Canada]], 2006 Census of Population |date=13 March 2007 |access-date=2007-03-14 |archive-date=12 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912163313/http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3521005&Geo2=PR&Code2=35&Data=Count&SearchText=Mississauga&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom= |url-status=dead }}</ref> fronting {{convert|13|km}} of shoreline on [[Lake Ontario]].

Mississauga is bounded by [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]] and [[Milton, Ontario|Milton]] to the west/southwest, [[Brampton]] to the north, Toronto to the east, and Lake Ontario to the south/south-east. [[Halton Hills, Ontario|Halton Hills]] borders Mississauga's north-west corner. With the exception of the southeast border with Toronto (Etobicoke Creek), Mississauga shares a land border with all previously mentioned municipalities.

Two major river valleys feed into the lake. The [[Credit River]] is by far the longest with the heaviest flow, it divides the western side of Mississauga from the central/eastern portions and enters the lake at the [[Port Credit, Ontario|Port Credit]] harbour. The indented, mostly forested valley was inhabited by first nation peoples long before European exploration of the area. The valley is protected and maintained by the Credit Valley Conservation Authority (CVCA).<ref name="Mississauga's Natural Areas">{{cite web|title=Mississauga's Natural Areas|url=http://www5.mississauga.ca/rec&parks/pdfs/MississaugaNaturalAreas.pdf|website=5.mississauga.ca|access-date=26 September 2014}}</ref>

[[Etobicoke Creek]] forms part of the eastern border of Mississauga with the city of Toronto. North of there it passes through the western limits of [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Pearson Airport]]. There have been two aviation accidents, in 1978 and 2005 where aircraft overshot the runway and slid into the Etobicoke creek banks. In 1954, heavy flooding resulted in some homes along the riverbank being swept into the lake after heavy rains from [[Hurricane Hazel]]. Since that storm, houses are no longer constructed along the floodplain. The creek and its tributaries are administered by the [[Toronto and Region Conservation Authority]] (TRCA).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Campion-Smith|first1=Bruce|title=Air France sues over crash|date=4 June 2008|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2008/06/04/air_france_sues_over_crash.html|publisher=Toronto Star|access-date=26 September 2014}}</ref>

Most land in Mississauga drains to either of the two main river systems, with the exception of the smaller Mary Fix and Cooksville Creeks which run roughly through the centre of Mississauga entering the lake near Port Credit. Some small streams and reservoirs are part of the [[Sixteen Mile Creek (Ontario)|Sixteen Mile Creek]] system in the far north-west corner of the city, but these drain toward the lake in neighbouring Milton and Oakville.

The shoreline of former [[Glacial Lake Iroquois]] roughly follows the Dundas Street alignment, although it is not noticeable in some places but is more prominent in others, such as the site of the former brickyard (Shoreline Dr. near Mavis Rd.), the ancient shoreline promenteau affords a clear view of downtown Toronto and Lake Ontario on clear days. The land in Mississauga in ranges from a maximum elevation of 214&nbsp;m (699&nbsp;ft) ASL in the far western corner, near the Hwy. 407/401 junction, to a minimum elevation at the Lake Ontario shore of 76&nbsp;m (249&nbsp;ft) above sea level.

Apart from the embankments of Credit River valley, it tributaries and the Iroquois shoreline, the only noticeable hills in Mississauga are actually part of the former [[Britannia Landfill]], now a golf course on Terry Fox Way.

On August 17 2024, heavy rainfalls caused localized flooding in areas across the city. The floods caused many traffic disruptions as well as dangerous road conditions and road closures. All creeks and rivers throughout Mississauga were either at full capacity or flooded into parks and greenspaces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gtamoldremoval.com/mississauga-flooding.html|title=Severe Thunderstorms and Heavy Rain Cause Local Flooding and Closures|work=gtamoldremoval.com|accessdate=17 August 2024}}</ref>

During snowfalls when temperatures hover close to freezing, northern parts of the city, such as around Derry Road, including Pearson Airport away from warmer Lake Ontario usually get more snow that sticks to the ground because of the lower temperatures, often when rain transitions into snow or mixed precipitation.{{cn|date=April 2024}} The reverse occurs when a strong storm approaches from the south kicking up [[lake effect snow]], bringing higher snowfall totals to south Mississauga. 
The city usually experiences at least six months of snow-free weather; however, there is the odd occurrence where snow does fall either in October or May, none which sticks to the ground.{{cn|date=April 2024}} The Port Credit and Lakeview areas have a micro-climate more affected by the proximity of the open lake, warming winter temperatures as a result, but it can be sharply cooler on spring and summer afternoons, this can also be the case in Clarkson, but with much less consistency.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

Most thunderstorms are not severe but can occasionally bring violent winds. The last known tornado to cause significant damage touched down on 7 July 1985, when an F1-rated tornado struck an industrial park in the Meadowvale area (Argentia Road), heavily damaging some buildings and some parked tractor trailers. A relatively strong tornado tore a path across Mississauga (then part of Toronto Township) on 24 June 1923, cutting a swath from present-day Meadowvale to near Cooksville, killing four people and causing massive property damage in a time when most of Mississauga was still rural farmland dotted with fruit orchards.<ref name="1985 tornado record meteo">{{cite web|title=Tornado F0, Ontario 1923-6-24 #23|url=http://www.recordmeteo.com/tornado-canada/Tornado-Ontario-1923-6-24-en-23.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714132911/http://www.recordmeteo.com/tornado-canada/Tornado-Ontario-1923-6-24-en-23.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 July 2014|access-date=7 June 2014}}</ref><ref name="Climate History">{{cite web|title=Mississauga Climate History|url=http://www.myweather2.com/City-Town/Canada/Ontario/Mississauga/climate-profile.aspx|access-date=26 September 2014}}</ref><ref name="Tornado F0">{{cite web|title=Tornado F0, Ontario 1923-6-24 #23|url=http://www.recordmeteo.com/tornado-canada/Tornado-Ontario-1923-6-24-en-23.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714132911/http://www.recordmeteo.com/tornado-canada/Tornado-Ontario-1923-6-24-en-23.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 July 2014|access-date=26 September 2014}}</ref>

In 2006, with the help of [[Project for Public Spaces]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pps.org/ |title=Project for Public Spaces |website=Pps.org |access-date=2011-03-02}}</ref> the city started hosting "My Mississauga" summer festivities at its Civic Square.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mississauga.ca/portal/discover/mymississauga |title=Discover Mississauga&nbsp;– My Mississauga |website=Mississauga.ca |access-date=2011-03-02 |archive-date=24 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224070425/http://www.mississauga.ca/portal/discover/mymississauga |url-status=dead }}</ref> Mississauga planned over 60 free events to bring more people to the city square. The square was transformed and included a movable stage, a snack bar, extra seating, and sports and gaming facilities (basketball nets, hockey arena, chess and checker boards) including a skate park. Some of the events included Senior's day on Tuesday, Family day on Wednesday, Vintage car Thursdays, with the main events being the [[Canada Day]] celebration, Rotary Ribfest, Tree Lighting Ceremony, and Beachfest.

Civic Square has completed its restructuring project using federal stimulus money, which features a permanent stage, a larger ice rink (which also serves as a fountain and wading pool during the summer season), media screens, and a permanent restaurant. It officially reopened at 22 June 2011 and has since been renamed as Mississauga Celebration Square. More events have been added such as holding free outdoor live concerts, and live telecast of [[UEFA European Football Championship]]. The square also holds weekly programming such as fitness classes, amphitheatre performances and movie nights during the summer, children's activities during spring and fall, and skate parties during the winter. The opening of the square has also allowed the city to hold its first annual [[New Year's Eve]] celebration in 2011.

In October 2012, the square had attracted its one millionth visitor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mississauga.ca/portal/celebrationsquare/thanksamillion |title=Thanks a Million |publisher=City of Mississauga |access-date=2013-04-28 |archive-date=2 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302173631/http://www.mississauga.ca/portal/celebrationsquare/thanksamillion |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The City of Mississauga has had only four mayors in its history. [[Martin Dobkin]] was the city's first mayor in 1974. He was then followed by [[Ron A. Searle]]. Searle was defeated in 1978 by then-city councillor and former mayor of Streetsville, McCallion. McCallion won 12 consecutive terms as mayor, but she chose to retire prior to the November 2014 election and was succeeded by Bonnie Crombie, who won the election.

McCallion was regarded as a force in provincial politics and often referred to as ''Hurricane Hazel'', after the [[Hurricane Hazel|devastating 1954 storm]] that struck the Toronto area. McCallion won or was acclaimed in every mayoral election from 1978 to 2010, in some later elections without even campaigning. In October 2010, McCallion won her twelfth term in office with over 76% of the votes. McCallion was the nation's longest-serving mayor and was runner-up in World Mayor 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldmayor.com/results05/worldmayor_finalists05.html |title=World Mayor 2005 Finalists |website=Worldmayor.com |access-date=2011-03-02}}</ref> In 2014 McCallion did not run again, but endorsed Crombie, the eventual winner who became mayor in November 2014.<ref name="new mayor" />

{{Main|Hurontario LRT}}
There are plans for the construction of an [[Light rail transit|LRT]] line along [[Hurontario Street]] stretching from Port Credit to southern Brampton, and possibly to Brampton's downtown. The project went through the Transit Project Assessment Process (TPAP) which includes environmental assessment. The line will be fully funded by the provincial government, with construction set to begin in 2018. Rapid transit lines could possibly be built on some other main thoroughfares, namely Dundas Street and Lakeshore Road, but no definite dates have been set.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hurontario-main.ca/ |title=Hurontario Main Street |website=Hurontario-main.ca |access-date=2010-07-27 |archive-date=6 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706182829/http://www.hurontario-main.ca/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

====Highways====
[[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]] (or the Macdonald-Cartier Freeway, connecting [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] to the [[Quebec]] border) passes through the city's north end. The eastern part uses the collector/express lane system and feeds into [[Ontario Highway 403|Highway 403]], the main freeway in the city, which runs through the City Centre and [[Erin Mills]] areas. The [[Queen Elizabeth Way]], the city's first freeway, runs through the southern half of the city. These three freeways each run east–west, with the exception of the 403 from the 401 to Cawthra Road, and from the 407 to QEW. North of the 401, the collector lanes of the 403 become [[Ontario Highway 410|Highway 410]], which goes to Brampton. Part of [[Ontario Highway 409|Highway 409]] is within the city of Mississauga, and it provides access to [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Pearson Airport]]. Two other freeways run along or close to Mississauga's municipal borders. [[Ontario Highway 407|Highway 407]] runs metres from the northern city limits in a power transmission corridor and forms the city's boundary with Milton between highways 401 and 403. [[Ontario Highway 427|Highway 427]] forms the Toronto-Mississauga boundary in the northeast, and is always within 2&nbsp;kilometres of the boundary further south, with the exception of the area around [[Centennial Park (Toronto)|Centennial Park]].
