Pennsylvania was founded in 1681 through a royal [[land grant]] to [[William Penn]], the son of [[William Penn (Royal Navy officer)|the state's namesake]]. Prior to that, between 1638 and 1655, a southeast portion of the state was part of [[New Sweden]], a [[Swedish Empire]] colony. Established as a haven for religious and political tolerance, the [[British colonization of the Americas|colonial-era]] [[Province of Pennsylvania]] was known for its relatively peaceful relations with native tribes, [[County commission|innovative government system]], and [[religious tolerance|religious pluralism]]. Pennsylvania played a vital and historic role in the [[American Revolution]] and the ultimately successful quest for independence from the [[British Empire]], hosting the [[First Continental Congress|First]] and [[Second Continental Congress]], which formed the [[Continental Army]] and appointed [[George Washington]] as its commander in 1775, and unanimously adopted the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] the following year.<ref name="American Creation">{{cite book |last=Ellis |first=Joseph |url=https://archive.org/details/americancreation0000elli_t3w8 |title=American Creation: Triumphs and Tragedies at the Founding of the Republic |date=2007 |publisher=Knopf |isbn=978-0-307-26369-8 |location=New York |pages=55–56 |author-link=Joseph Ellis |url-access=registration}}</ref> On December 12, 1787, Pennsylvania became the second state to ratify the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]].<ref>[https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/pennsylvania U.S. News | Best States | Pennsylvania]</ref> The [[Battle of Gettysburg]], fought in and around [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]] over three days in July 1863, was the bloodiest and most decisive battle of the [[American Civil War]], claiming over 50,000 [[Union Army|Union]] and [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] fatalities and repelling [[Robert E. Lee]]'s invasion of the North, leading to the [[Conclusion of the American Civil War|Union's preservation]]. Throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries, the state's manufacturing-based economy contributed to the development of much of the nation's early infrastructure, including key bridges, [[skyscraper]]s, and military hardware used in U.S.-led victories in [[World War I]], [[World War II]], and the [[Cold War]].

===Indigenous settlement===
Pennsylvania's history of human habitation extends thousands of years before the foundation of the colonial [[Province of Pennsylvania]] in 1681. [[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] believe the first [[Peopling of the Americas|settlement of the Americas]] occurred at least 15,000 years ago, during the [[Last Glacial Period]], though it is unclear when humans first inhabited present-day Pennsylvania.

By the time [[European colonization of the Americas]] began, at least two major Native American tribes inhabited Pennsylvania.<ref name="PHMC12" /> The first, the [[Lenape]], spoke an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]] and inhabited the eastern region of the state, then known as [[Lenapehoking]]. It included most of present-day [[New Jersey]] and the [[Lehigh Valley]] and [[Delaware Valley]] regions in eastern and southeastern Pennsylvania. The Lenape's territory ended somewhere between the [[Delaware River]] in the east and the [[Susquehanna River]] in central Pennsylvania. The second tribe, the [[Susquehannock]], spoke an [[Iroquoian language]] and were based in [[Western Pennsylvania]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] state in the north to [[West Virginia]] in the southwest, including the Susquehanna, [[Allegheny River|Allegheny]], and [[Monongahela River|Monongahela]] rivers near present-day [[Pittsburgh]].<ref>"On the Susquehannocks: Natives having used Baltimore County as hunting grounds - The Historical Society of Baltimore County". www.HSOBC.org.

On March 12, 1664, [[Charles II of England|King Charles II of England]] gave [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]] a grant that incorporated all lands included in the original Virginia Company of Plymouth Grant and other lands.

On June 24, 1664, the Duke of York sold the portion of his large grant that included present-day [[New Jersey]] to [[John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton|John Berkeley]] and [[George Carteret]] for a proprietary colony.

Between 1730 and when the Pennsylvania Colony was shut down by [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] with the [[Currency Act]] in 1764, the Pennsylvania Colony made its own paper money to account for the shortage of actual gold and silver. The paper money was called [[Colonial Scrip]].

The Colony issued bills of credit, which were as good as gold or silver coins because of their legal tender status. Since they were issued by the government and not a banking institution, they were interest-free, largely defraying the expense of the government and therefore taxation of the people. It also promoted general employment and prosperity, since the government used discretion and did not issue excessive amounts that inflated the currency. [[Benjamin Franklin]] had a hand in creating this currency, whose utility, he said, was never to be disputed. The currency also met with "cautious approval" by [[Adam Smith]].<ref>Hamilton, Alexander and Syrett, Harold C. ''The Papers of Alexander Hamilton''. 1963, page 240.</ref>

The post-Civil War era, known as the [[Gilded Age]], saw the continued rise of industry in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania was home to some of the largest steel companies in the world. [[Andrew Carnegie]] founded the [[Carnegie Steel Company]] in [[Pittsburgh]] and [[Charles M. Schwab]] founded [[Bethlehem Steel]] in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]]. Other titans of industry, including [[John D. Rockefeller]] and [[Jay Gould]], also operated in Pennsylvania. In the latter half of the 19th century, the U.S. [[oil industry]] was born in [[Western Pennsylvania]], which supplied the vast majority of [[kerosene]] for years thereafter. As the [[Pennsylvania oil rush]] developed, Pennsylvania's oil boom towns, such as [[Titusville, Pennsylvania|Titusville]], rose and later fell. Coal mining, primarily in the state's [[Coal Region]] in the northeast region of the state, also was a major industry for much of the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1903, [[Milton S. Hershey]] began construction on a chocolate factory in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania]]; [[The Hershey Company]] grew to become the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America. [[Heinz Company]] was also founded during this period. These huge companies exercised a large influence on the politics of Pennsylvania; as [[Henry Demarest Lloyd]] put it, oil baron John D.

With job losses came heavy population losses, especially in the state's largest cities. Pittsburgh lost its place among the [[List of most populous cities in the United States by decade|top ten most populous cities in the United States]] by 1950, and Philadelphia dropped to the fifth and currently the [[List of United States cities by population|sixth-largest city]] after decades of being among the top three.

After 1990, as information-based industries became more important in the economy, state and local governments put more resources into the old, well-established public library system. Some localities, however, used new state funding to cut local taxes.<ref>William F. Stine, "Does State Aid Stimulate Public Library Expenditures? Evidence from Pennsylvania's Enhancement Aid Program" ''Library Quarterly'' (2006) 76#1 107-139.</ref> New ethnic groups, especially [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics and Latinos]], began entering the state to fill low-skill jobs in agriculture and service industries. For example, in [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester County]], [[Mexican Americans|Mexican]] immigrants brought the [[Spanish language]], increased [[Catholicism]], high birth rates, and cuisine when they were hired as agricultural laborers; in some rural localities, they made up half or more of the population.<ref>Victor M.

[[Stateside Puerto Ricans]] built a large community in the state's third-largest city, [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], where they comprise over 40% of the city's population as of 2000.<ref>Gilbert Marzan, "Still Looking for that Elsewhere: Puerto Rican Poverty and Migration in the Northeast."

In the 20th century, as Pennsylvania's historical national and even global leadership in [[mining]] largely ceased and its [[steelmaking]] and other heavy manufacturing sectors slowed, the state sought to grow its service and other industries to replace the jobs and economic productivity lost from the downturn of these industries. Pittsburgh's concentration of universities has enabled it to be a leader in technology and healthcare. Similarly, Philadelphia has a concentration of university expertise. Healthcare, retail, transportation, and tourism are some of the state's growing industries of the postindustrial era. As in the rest of the nation, most residential population growth has occurred in suburban rather than central city areas, although both major cities have had significant revitalization in their downtown areas.<ref>Ashok K. Dutt, and Baleshwar Thakur, ''City, Society, and Planning'' (Concept Publishing Company, 2007) pp. 55–56</ref> Philadelphia anchors the [[List of Metropolitan Statistical Areas|seventh-largest]] [[metropolitan area]] in the country and one of the largest metropolitan areas in the world, and Pittsburgh is the center of the nation's 27th-largest metropolitan areas.

[[File:Flickr - Nicholas T - Endless Mountains Landscape (1).jpg|thumb|Autumn in [[North Branch Township, Pennsylvania|North Branch Township]] in [[Wyoming County, Pennsylvania|Wyoming County]] in October 2011]]
Pennsylvania's diverse topography produces a variety of climates, though the entire state experiences cold winters and humid summers. Straddling two major zones, the majority of the state, except for the southeastern corner, has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfb''). The southern portion of the state has a [[humid subtropical]] climate. The largest city, [[Philadelphia]], has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (Köppen ''Cfa'').

Summers are generally hot and humid. Moving toward the mountainous interior of the state, the winter climate becomes colder, the number of cloudy days increases, and snowfall amounts are greater. Western areas of the state, particularly locations near [[Lake Erie]], can receive over {{convert|100|in|cm}} of snowfall annually, and the entire state receives plentiful precipitation throughout the year. The state may be subject to severe weather from spring through summer into autumn. Tornadoes occur annually in the state, sometimes in large numbers, such as 30 recorded tornadoes in 2011; generally speaking, these tornadoes do not cause significant damage.<ref>[http://www.homefacts.com/tornadoes/Pennsylvania.html/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517123642/http://www.homefacts.com/tornadoes/Pennsylvania.html/|date=May 17, 2015}}</ref>

===Race and ethnicity===
[[File:Ethnic Origins in Pennsylvania.png|thumb|330x330px|Ethnic origins of Pennsylvanians]]
The vast majority of Pennsylvania's population is made up of whites, blacks and Hispanics, with the latter two being minorities and having significant populations. Non-Hispanic Whites make up the majority of Pennsylvania; they are mostly descended from German, Irish, Scottish, Welsh, Italian, and English immigrants. Rural portions of South Central Pennsylvania are recognized nationally for their [[Amish#Population and distribution|Amish communities]]. [[Wyoming Valley]], including [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] and [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], has the highest percentage of white residents of any metropolitan area with a population of 500,000 or above in the U.S.; in Wyoming Valley, 96.2% of the population claim to be white with no Hispanic background. The state's Hispanic or Latino American population grew by 82.6% between 2000 and 2010, marking one of the largest increases in a state's Hispanic population. The significant growth of the Hispanic or Latino population is due to migration to the state mainly from [[Puerto Rico]], a U.S. territory, and to a lesser extent immigration from countries such as the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Mexico]], and various [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]n nations and a wave of Hispanic and Latinos leaving [[New York City]] and [[New Jersey]] for safer and more affordable living.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

The majority of Hispanic or Latino Americans in Pennsylvania are of [[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Rican]] descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_DP05&prodType=table|title=American FactFinder—Results|author=Data Access and Dissemination Systems (DADS)|website=census.gov|access-date=June 6, 2015|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212213801/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_DP05&prodType=table|archive-date=February 12, 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://content.usatoday.com/dist/custom/gci/InsidePage.aspx?cId=thedailyjournal&sParam=53490820.story |title=The Daily Journal—Puerto Rico's population exodus is all about jobs |website=USA Today |access-date=June 6, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904011425/http://content.usatoday.com/dist/custom/gci/InsidePage.aspx?cId=thedailyjournal&sParam=53490820.story |archive-date=September 4, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Most of the remaining Hispanic or Latino population is made up of [[Mexican American|Mexicans]] and [[Dominican American|Dominicans]], and the majority of Hispanics and Latinos are concentrated in Philadelphia, the [[Lehigh Valley]], and South Central Pennsylvania.<ref name="annest">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/asrh/2004/tables/SC-EST2004-03-42.xls |title=Annual Estimates of the Population |access-date=July 31, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120132138/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/asrh/2004/tables/SC-EST2004-03-42.xls |archive-date=January 20, 2013 }}</ref> The Hispanic or Latino population is greatest in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]], [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]], [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], [[York, Pennsylvania|York]], and around Philadelphia.

The Asian population swelled by almost 60%, mostly Indian, Vietnamese, and Chinese immigrants, and many Asians moving to [[Philadelphia]] from New York City. The rapid growth of this community has given Pennsylvania one of the largest Asian populations in the nation.

Counties, municipalities, and [[school district]]s levy taxes on real estate. In addition, some local bodies assess a [[income tax|wage tax]] on personal income. Generally, the total wage tax rate is capped at 1% of income but some municipalities with [[home rule]] charters may charge more than 1%. Thirty-two of Pennsylvania's sixty-seven counties levy a [[property tax|personal property tax]] on stocks, bonds, and similar holdings. With the exception of the city of [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, municipalities and school districts are allowed to enact a local earned income tax within the purview of Act 32. Residents of these municipalities and school districts are required to file a local income tax return in addition to federal and state returns. This local return is filed with the local income tax collector, a private collection agency appointed by a particular county to collect the local earned income and local services tax (the latter a flat fee deducted from salaried employees working within a particular municipality or school district).<ref>{{cite web |title=Local Income Tax Information |url=http://dced.pa.gov/local-government/local-income-tax-information/ |website=PA Department of Community & Economic Development |access-date=November 30, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201022801/http://dced.pa.gov/local-government/local-income-tax-information/#.WD8AMuYrJEY |archive-date=December 1, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Philadelphia]] has its own local income taxation system. Philadelphia-based employers are required to withhold the Philadelphia wage tax from the salaries of their employees. Residents of Philadelphia working for an employer are not required to file a local return as long as their Philadelphia wage tax is fully withheld by their employer. If their employer does not withhold the Philadelphia wage tax, residents are required to register with the Revenue Department and file an Earnings Tax return. Residents of Philadelphia with self-employment income are required to file a Net Profits Tax (NPT) return, while those with business income from Philadelphia sources are required to obtain a Commercial Activity License (CAL) and pay the Business Income and Receipts Tax (BIRT) and the NPT. Residents with unearned income except interest from checking and savings accounts are required to file and pay the School Income-tax (SIT).<ref>{{cite web |title=Department of Revenue |url=https://beta.phila.gov/departments/department-of-revenue/ |website=City of Philadelphia |access-date=November 30, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201014425/https://beta.phila.gov/departments/department-of-revenue/ |archive-date=December 1, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The complexity of Pennsylvania's local tax filing system has been criticized by experts, who note that the outsourcing of collections to private entities is akin to [[tax farming]] and that many new residents are caught off guard and end up facing failure to file penalties even if they did not owe any tax. Attempts to transfer local income tax collections to the state level by having a separate local section on the state income tax return, currently the method used to collect local income taxes in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Maryland]], [[Indiana]], and [[Iowa]], have been unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite web|title=Taking a Closer Look at Government: Pennsylvania's Local Taxation "System"|url=http://issuespa.org/content/taking-closer-look-government-pennsylvanias-local-taxation-system |website=issuespa.org|access-date=November 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201015143/http://issuespa.org/content/taking-closer-look-government-pennsylvanias-local-taxation-system |archive-date=December 1, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Since the latter half of the 20th century, Pennsylvania has been perceived as a powerful [[swing state]], and winning Pennsylvania has since been deemed as essential to [[President of the United States|U.S. presidential candidates]]. Only thrice between [[1932 United States presidential election|1932]] and [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] (1932, 1948, and [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]], with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Harry S. Truman]], and [[Richard Nixon]], respectively) has a presidential candidate been able to win the White House while losing Pennsylvania.

Between 1992 and 2016, Pennsylvania trended [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] in presidential elections; [[Bill Clinton]] won the state twice by large margins and [[Al Gore]] won it by a slightly closer margin in 2000.

Despite voting for the Democratic ticket for president in every election between 1992 and 2012, Pennsylvania has a history of electing Republican U.S. senators. From 2009 to 2011, the state was represented by two Democratic senators for the first time since 1947 after Republican Senator [[Arlen Specter]] switched party affiliation. In 2010, Republicans recaptured a U.S. Senate seat and a majority of the state's congressional seats, control of both chambers of the state legislature, and the governorship. Democrats won back the governorship, however, four years later in the [[Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, 2014|2014 election]]. It was the first time since a governor became eligible for reelection that an incumbent governor had been defeated in a reelection bid.

Historically, Democratic strength was concentrated in Philadelphia in the southeast, the Pittsburgh, and [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]] areas in the southwest, and [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] and [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]] in the northeast. Republican strength was concentrated in the Philadelphia suburbs and the more rural areas in the state's central, northeastern, and western portions, some of which have long been considered among the nation's most conservative areas. Since 1992, however, the Philadelphia suburbs have swung Democratic; the brand of Republicanism there was traditionally moderate. In the 21st century, however, Pittsburgh suburbs, which historically had been Democratic strongholds, have swung more Republican.

Democratic political consultant [[James Carville]] once pejoratively described Pennsylvania as "Philadelphia in the east, Pittsburgh in the west, and Alabama in the middle", suggesting that political power in the state was based in its two largest cities, which have been reliably Democratic, offset by the state's large rural power base, which has proven equally reliably Republican. Political analysts and editorials refer to central Pennsylvania as the "T" in statewide elections. The state's three valleys ([[Delaware Valley|Delaware]], [[Lehigh Valley|Lehigh]], and [[Wyoming Valley|Wyoming]] Valleys) and [[Greater Pittsburgh]] generally vote Democratic, while the majority of the counties in the central part of the state vote Republican. As a result, maps showing the results of statewide elections invariably form a shape that resembles a "T".

Pennsylvania retains the [[death penalty]], although there is currently a gubernatorial hold on executions.<ref>{{Cite web |title=State by State |url=https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/state-and-federal-info/state-by-state |access-date=April 12, 2023 |website=Death Penalty Information Center |language=en-US}}</ref>
