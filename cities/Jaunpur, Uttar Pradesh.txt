It is believed that the famous temple of [[Sheetala Chaukia Dham Mandir Jaunpur|Chaukiya Devi]] was built in the glory of their clan-deity either by the Yadavs or the Bhars- but in view of the predilections of the Bhars, it seems more logical to conclude that this temple was built by the Bhars. The Bhars were non-Aryans. The worship of Shiv and Shakti was prevalent in the non-aryans. The Bhars also held some power in Jaunpur.<ref name=":0" />

In 1359, the city was invaded by the [[Sultan of Delhi]] [[Feroz Shah Tughlaq]] and named in memory of his cousin, [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]], whose given name was Jauna Khan.<ref name="Goron">{{cite book |last1=Goron |first1=Stan |last2=Goenka |first2=J.

The Sultanate was in disarray because of factional fighting for power, and in 1393 Malik Sarwar declared independence. He and his adopted son Mubarak Shah founded what came to be known as the [[Sharqi dynasty]] (dynasty of the East). During the Sharqi period (1394 and 1479)<ref name="Rangan">{{cite news |last1=Datta |first1=Rangan |date=22 April 2023 |title=Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh — the land of 'Shahi' forts, mosques and more |url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/my-kolkata/places/jaunpur-in-uttar-pradesh-the-land-of-fort-mosques-and-more/cid/1931639 |issue=The Telegraph |agency=My Kolkata |access-date=28 August 2023}}</ref> the Jaunpur Sultanate was a strong military power in Northern India, and on several occasions threatened the Delhi Sultanate.[[File:The War Elephants Citranand and Udiya Collide in Battle.jpg|thumb|It depicts the elephant Citranand attacking another, called Udiya, during the Mughal campaign against the rebel forces of Khan Zaman and Bahadur Khan in 1567.|left]] [[File:View at Juanpore, on the River Ganges (IV, June 1847, p.60) - Copy.jpg|thumb|260px|View at Juanpore, on the River Gomti (1847)<ref name="Offering1847">{{cite journal|date=June 1847|title=View at Jaunpur, on the River Ganges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S1wEAAAAQAAJ|journal=Wesleyan Juvenile Offering|volume=IV|page=60|access-date=17 November 2015}}</ref>]]The Jaunpur Sultanate attained its greatest height under the younger brother of Mubarak Shah, who ruled as Shams-ud-din Ibrahim Shah (ruled 1402–1440). To the east, his kingdom extended to Bihar, and to the west, to Kanauj; he even marched on Delhi at one point. Under the aegis of a Muslim holy man named Qutb al-Alam, he threatened the [[Sultanate of Bengal]] under [[Shihabuddin Bayazid Shah]].<ref name="Goron"/>{{rp|343}}

During the reign of Husain Shah (1456–76), the Jaunpur army was perhaps the biggest in India, and Husain decided to attempt a conquest of Delhi. However, he was defeated on three successive attempts by [[Bahlul Khan Lodi]]. It is a dominant trend in modern historiography of the period that this defeat was a cause of a large number of eunuchs in the military ranks. Finally, under [[Sikandar Lodi]], the Delhi Sultanate was able to reconquer Jaunpur in 1493, bringing that sultanate to an end.

The Jaunpur Sultanate was a major center of [[Urdu]] and [[Sufi]] knowledge and culture. The Sharqi dynasty was known for its excellent communal relations between [[Muslim]]s and [[Hindu]]s, perhaps stemming from the fact that the Sharqis themselves were originally indigenous converts to Islam, as opposed to descendants of [[Persian people|Persians]] or [[Afghan people|Afghans]]. Jaunpur's independence came to an end in 1480, when the city was conquered by [[Sikander Lodi]], the Sultan of [[Delhi]]. The Sharqi kings attempted for several years to retake the city, but ultimately failed.

Although many of the Sharqi monuments were destroyed when the [[Lodi dynasty|Lodi]]s took the city, several important [[mosque]]s remain, most notably the [[Atala Masjid, Jaunpur|Atala Masjid]], [[Jama Masjid, Jaunpur|Jama Masjid]] (now known as the Badi (big mosque) Masjid) and the [[Lal Darwaza Masjid, Jaunpur|Lal Darwaza Masjid]]. The Jaunpur mosques display a unique architectural style, combining traditional Hindu and Muslim motifs with purely original elements. The old bridge over the [[Gomti River]] in Jaunpur dates from 1564, the era of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Emperor Akbar]]. The bridge is still being used for transportation. The Jaunpur Qila, a fortress from the [[Tughlaq]] era, also remains in good form.

Jaunpur district was annexed into [[British Raj|British India]] based on the Permanent settlement of 1779, and thus was subject to the [[Zamindar]]i system of land revenue collection.

During the [[Revolt of 1857]] the [[Sikh]] troops in Jaunpur joined the Indian rebels. The district was eventually reconquered for the British by [[Gurkha]] troops from [[Nepal]]. Jaunpur then became a district administrative center. The major rebellion took place in Jaunpur when freedom fighters, led by Pandit Badrinath Tiwari, unfurled national flag at the railway station of Nibhapur. It was marked by a series of government-led suppressions of Pandit Badrinath Tiwari and his fellow freedom fighters throughout the district brave Pandit Ji refused to bow down in front of British atrocities.
