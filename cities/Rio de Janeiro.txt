It is the [[List of cities in Brazil by population|second-most-populous city]] in [[Brazil]] (after [[São Paulo]]) and the [[Largest cities in the Americas|sixth-most-populous city]] in the Americas.

Founded in 1565 by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], the city was initially the seat of the [[Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro]], a domain of the [[Portuguese Empire]]. In 1763, it became the capital of the [[State of Brazil]], a [[List of states of the Portuguese Empire|state of the Portuguese Empire]]. In 1808, when the [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|Portuguese Royal Court moved to Brazil]], Rio de Janeiro became the seat of the court of Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]]. She subsequently, under the leadership of her son the [[prince regent]] [[John VI of Portugal]], raised Brazil to the dignity of a kingdom, within the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves]]. Rio remained as the capital of the [[pluricontinentalism|pluricontinental]] monarchy until 1822, when the [[War of Independence of Brazil|Brazilian War of Independence]] began. This is one of the few instances in history that the capital of a colonizing country officially shifted to a city in one of its colonies. Rio de Janeiro subsequently served as the capital of the independent monarchy, the [[Empire of Brazil]], until 1889, and then the capital of a republican Brazil until 1960 when the capital was transferred to [[Brasília]].

=== Colonial period ===
[[File:Palácio Pedro Ernesto - Fundação da Cidade.jpg|left|thumb|Founding of Rio de Janeiro on 1 March 1565]]
Europeans first encountered [[Guanabara Bay]] on 1 January 1502 (hence Rio de Janeiro, "January River"), during a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] expedition under explorer [[Gaspar de Lemos]], captain of a ship in [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]]'s fleet, or under [[Gonçalo Coelho]].<ref>Jorge Couto, 1995, ''A Construção do Brasil'', Lisbon: Cosmos.</ref> Allegedly the Florentine explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] participated as an observer at the invitation of [[Manuel I of Portugal|King Manuel I]] in the same expedition.

In 1555, one of the islands of Guanabara Bay, now called [[Villegagnon Island]], was occupied by 500 French colonists under the French [[admiral]] [[Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon]]. Consequently, Villegagnon built [[Fort Coligny]] on the island when attempting to establish the [[France Antarctique]] colony. Eventually this French settlement became too much of a threat to the established Portuguese colony and in 1560 the order was made to get rid of them. A years-long military aggression was then initiated by the new Governor General of Brazil Mem De Sa, and later continued by his nephew Estacio De Sa. On 20 January 1567, a final defeat was imposed on the French forces and they were decisively expelled from Brazil for good.

The city of Rio de Janeiro proper was founded on 1 March 1565 by the Portuguese, led by [[Estácio de Sá]], including {{ill|Antônio de Mariz|pt}}. It was named ''São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro'', in honor of St. Sebastian, the [[Saint's name|saint who was the namesake and patron]] of the Portuguese then-monarch [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebastião]]. ''Rio de Janeiro'' was the name of Guanabara Bay. Until early in the 18th century, the city was threatened or invaded by several mostly French pirates and buccaneers, such as [[Jean-François Duclerc]] and [[René Duguay-Trouin]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of Rio |url=http://www.paralumun.com/citrio.htm |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227075155/http://www.paralumun.com/citrio.htm |archive-date=27 December 2008 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Paralumun.com}}</ref>

In the late 17th century, still during the Sugar Era, the [[Bandeirantes]] discovered gold and diamonds in the neighboring [[captaincy]] of [[Minas Gerais]], thus Rio de Janeiro became a much more practical port for exporting wealth (gold, precious stones, besides the sugar) than [[Salvador, Bahia]], much farther northeast.

From the colonial period until the first independent era, Rio de Janeiro was a city of slaves. There was a large influx of [[Slavery in Brazil|African slaves]] to Rio de Janeiro: in 1819, there were 145,000 slaves in the captaincy.

When [[Pedro I of Brazil|Prince Pedro]] proclaimed the [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence|independence of Brazil]] in 1822, he decided to keep Rio de Janeiro as the capital of his [[Empire of Brazil|new empire]] while the place was enriched with sugar cane agriculture in the Campos region and, especially, with the new coffee cultivation in the [[Paraíba Valley]].<ref name="HCRJ" /> In order to separate the province from the capital of the Empire, the city was converted in Neutral Municipality in 1834, passing the [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|province of Rio de Janeiro]] to have [[Niterói]] as capital.<ref name="HCRJ" />

As a political center of the country, Rio concentrated the political-partisan life of the Empire. It was the main stage of the abolitionist and republican movements in the last half of the 19th century.<ref name="HCRJ" /> At that time the number of slaves was drastically reduced and the city was developed, with modern drains, animal trams, train stations crossing the city, gas and electric lighting, telephone and telegraph wiring, water and river plumbing.<ref name="HCRJ" /> Rio continued as the capital of Brazil after 1889, when the monarchy was [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|replaced]] by a republic.

On 6 February 1889 the Bangu Textile Factory was founded, with the name of Industrial Progress Company of Brazil (Companhia Progresso Industrial do Brasil). The factory was officially opened on 8 March 1893, in a complex with varying architectural styles like [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]], [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] and a tower in [[Mansard roof|Mansard Roof]] style. After the opening in 1893, workers from [[Great Britain]] arrived in Bangu to work in the textile factory. The old farms became worker villages with red-bricks houses, and a neo-gothic church was created, which still exists as the Saint Sebastian and Saint Cecilia Parish Church. Street cinemas and cultural buildings also appeared. In May 1894, [[Thomas Donohoe]], a British worker from [[Busby, East Renfrewshire|Busby]], Scotland, arrived in Bangu.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Who is the true father of football in Brazil? |work=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/24537173 |access-date=25 November 2015 |archive-date=1 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101115817/http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/24537173 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Donohoe was amazed to discover that there was absolutely no knowledge of football among Brazilians. So he wrote to his wife, Elizabeth, asking her to bring a football when she joined him. And shortly after her arrival, in September 1894, the first football match in Brazil took place in the field beside the textile factory. It was a five-a-side match between British workers, and took place six months before the first game organized by [[Charles William Miller|Charles Miller]] in São Paulo. However, the Bangu Football Club was not formally created until 1904.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bangu Athletic Club History [Portuguese] |url=http://www.bangu-ac.com.br/historia.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101115818/http://www.bangu-ac.com.br/historia.htm |archive-date=1 January 2016}}</ref>

[[File:Rio de Janeiro ca1910s photo from USA Library of Congress 19301u.jpg|thumb|Rio de Janeiro, {{circa}} 1910s]]

At the time Brazil's [[First Brazilian Republic|Old Republic]] was established, the city lacked [[urban planning]] and [[sanitation]], which helped spread several diseases, such as [[yellow fever]], [[dysentery]], [[variola]], [[tuberculosis]] and even [[black death]]. [[Francisco Pereira Passos|Pereira Passos]], who was named mayor in 1902, imposed reforms to modernize the city, demolishing the [[cortiço]]s where most of the poor population lived. These people then moved to live in the city's hills, creating the first [[favelas]].<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Suppia |first1=Alfredo |last2=Scarabello |first2=Marília |date=7 May 2014 |title=As reformas do Rio de Janeiro no início do século XX |publisher=Universidade Virtual do Estado de São Paulo |language=pt |url=http://pre.univesp.br/as-reformas-do-rio-de-janeiro-no-inicio-do-seculo-xx#.WP3sUfnysdU |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523110959/http://pre.univesp.br/as-reformas-do-rio-de-janeiro-no-inicio-do-seculo-xx#.WP3sUfnysdU |archive-date=23 May 2014}}</ref> Inspired by the city of [[Paris]], Passos built the [[Theatro Municipal (Rio de Janeiro)|Municipal Theatre]], the [[Museu Nacional de Belas Artes|National Museum of Fine Arts]] and the [[National Library of Brazil|National Library]] in the city's center; brought [[electric power]] to Rio and created larger avenues to adapt the city to [[automobiles]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Reforma Urbanística de Pereira Passos, o Rio com cara de Paris |url=http://educacao.globo.com/artigo/reforma-urbanistica-de-pereira-passos-o-rio-com-cara-de-paris.html |publisher=[[Grupo Globo]] |language=pt |access-date=24 April 2017 |archive-date=31 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231052142/http://educacao.globo.com/artigo/reforma-urbanistica-de-pereira-passos-o-rio-com-cara-de-paris.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Passos also named [[Oswaldo Cruz]] as Director General of Public Health.

In 1910, Rio saw the [[Revolt of the Lash]], where [[Afro-Brazilian]] crew members in the [[Brazilian Navy]] mutinied against the heavy use of [[corporal punishment]], which was similar to the punishment slaves received. The mutineers took control of the [[Brazilian battleship Minas Geraes|battleship ''Minas Geraes'']] and threatened to fire on the city. Another military revolt occurred in 1922, the [[Copacabana Fort revolt]], a march against the Old Republic's [[coronelism]] and [[café com leite politics]]. This revolt marked the beginning of [[Tenentism]], a movement that resulted in the [[Brazilian Revolution of 1930]] that started the [[Vargas Era]].

[[File:Bondinho Rio 1940.jpg|thumb|The [[Sugarloaf Cable Car]] in the 1940s]]
Until the early years of the 20th century, the city was largely limited to the neighborhood now known as the historic city center (see below), on the mouth of Guanabara Bay. The city's center of gravity began to shift south and west to the so-called [[South Zone (Rio de Janeiro)|Zona Sul]] (South Zone) in the early part of the 20th century, when the first tunnel was built under the mountains between [[Botafogo]] and the neighborhood that is now known as [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana]]. Expansion of the city to the north and south was facilitated by the consolidation and electrification of Rio's streetcar transit system after 1905.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Boone |first=Christopher G |year=1995 |title=Streetcars and Politics in Rio de Janeiro: Private Enterprise versus Municipal Government in Mass Transit Delivery, 1903–1920 |journal=Journal of Latin American Studies |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=343–365 |doi=10.1017/s0022216x00010786 |s2cid=145351010 |issn=0022-216X}}</ref> Botafogos natural environment, combined with the fame of the [[Copacabana Palace]] Hotel, ''the'' luxury hotel of the Americas in the 1930s, helped Rio to gain the reputation it still holds today as a beach party town.

Plans for moving the nation's capital city from Rio de Janeiro to the center of Brazil had been occasionally discussed, and when [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] was elected president in 1955, it was partially on the strength of promises to build a new capital.<ref>[http://www.cpdoc.fgv.br/nav_jk/htm/biografias/juscelino_kubitschek.asp Juscelino Kubitschek and the city of Rio de Janeiro] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315094527/http://www.cpdoc.fgv.br/nav_jk/htm/biografias/juscelino_kubitschek.asp |date=15 March 2015 }}</ref> Though many thought that it was just [[Political campaign|campaign]] rhetoric, Kubitschek managed to have Brasília and a new [[Distrito Federal (Brazil)|Federal District]] built, at great cost, by 1960. On 21 April of that year, the capital of Brazil was officially moved to Brasília. The territory of the former Federal District became its own state, Guanabara, after the bay that borders it to the east, encompassing just the city of Rio de Janeiro. After the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|1964 coup d'état]] that installed a [[Brazilian military government|military dictatorship]], the [[city-state]] was the only state left in Brazil to oppose the military. Then, in 1975, a presidential decree known as "The Fusion" removed the city's federative status and merged it with the [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|State of Rio de Janeiro]], with the city of Rio de Janeiro replacing [[Niterói]] as the state's capital, and establishing the [[Greater Rio de Janeiro|Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=24 September 2013 |title=Em 15 de março de 1975, Guanabara e Rio se transformaram num único estado |url=http://acervo.oglobo.globo.com/fatos-historicos/em-15-de-marco-de-1975-guanabara-rio-se-transformaram-num-unico-estado-10121382 |access-date=22 April 2017 |website=Acervo O Globo |publisher=[[O Globo]] |language=pt |archive-date=21 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171121223526/http://acervo.oglobo.globo.com/fatos-historicos/em-15-de-marco-de-1975-guanabara-rio-se-transformaram-num-unico-estado-10121382 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1992, Rio hosted the [[Earth Summit]], a [[United Nations]] conference to fight [[environmental degradation]]. Twenty years later, in 2012, the city hosted another conference on [[sustainable development]], named [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]]. The city hosted the [[World Youth Day 2013|World Youth Day in 2013]], the second [[World Youth Day]] in [[South America]] and first in Brazil. In the sports field, Rio de Janeiro was the host of the [[2007 Pan American Games]] and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final]]. On 2 October 2009, the [[International Olympic Committee]] [[Bids for the 2016 Summer Olympics|announced]] that Rio de Janeiro would host the [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Olympic Games]] and the [[2016 Summer Paralympics|2016 Paralympic Games]], beating competitors [[Chicago]], [[Tokyo]], and [[Madrid]]. The city became the first South American city to host the event and the second Latin American city (after [[Mexico City]] in [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]]) to host the Games. Since the early 2010s, Rio de Janeiro has been inscribed as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] for its arts, urban culture and [[designed landscape]]s set around a natural environment.

Rio de Janeiro is near the west end of a strip (from [[Cabo Frio]] to just east of [[Ilha Grande]]) of Brazil's Atlantic coast close to the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] where the shoreline is oriented east and west; the city thus faces largely south. It was founded at the entrance to an inlet, [[Guanabara Bay]] (Baía de Guanabara), which is marked by a point of land called Sugar Loaf (Pão de Açúcar) – a "calling card" of the city.<ref>{{Cite web |date=8 March 2011 |title=Where is Rio de Janeiro? |url=http://riobrazilblog.com/where-is-rio-de-janeiro |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105085554/http://riobrazilblog.com/where-is-rio-de-janeiro |archive-date=5 November 2013 |access-date=12 March 2013 |publisher=Riobrazilblog.com}}</ref>

===Environment===
Due to the high concentration of industries in the metropolitan region, the city has faced serious problems of environmental pollution. The [[Guanabara Bay]] has lost mangrove areas and suffers from residues from domestic and industrial sewage, oils and heavy metals. Although its waters renew when they reach the sea, the bay is the final receiver of all the tributaries generated along its banks and in the basins of the many rivers and streams that flow into it. The levels of particulate matter in the air are twice as high as that recommended by the [[World Health Organization]], in part because of the large numbers of vehicles in circulation.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Afra Balazina |date=21 September 2007 |title=Estudo revela poluição elevada em seis capitais |trans-title=Study reveals high pollution levels in six capitals |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u330220.shtml |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221042944/http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u330220.shtml |archive-date=21 December 2007 |access-date=26 October 2008 |website=Folha Online |language=pt}}</ref>

The waters of Sepetiba Bay are slowly following the path traced by Guanabara Bay, with sewage generated by a population of the order of 1.29 million inhabitants being released without treatment in streams or rivers. With regard to industrial pollution, highly toxic wastes, with high concentrations of heavy metals – mainly [[zinc]] and [[cadmium]] – have been dumped over the years by factories in the industrial districts of [[Santa Cruz, Rio de Janeiro|Santa Cruz]], [[Itaguaí]] and [[Nova Iguaçu]], constructed under the supervision of State policies.<ref name="OQ">{{Cite web |year=2001 |title=Contexto ambiental da Baía de Sepetiba |url=http://www.koinonia.org.br/oq/dossies/marambaia/not_contexto1.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501032842/http://www.koinonia.org.br/oq/dossies/marambaia/not_contexto1.htm |archive-date=1 May 2013 |access-date=26 October 2008 |publisher=Observatório Quilombola (OQ) |language=pt}}</ref>

The decontamination actions involve the transfer of sludge to large craters present in the lagoon itself, and the creation of a new direct and underground connection with the sea, which will contribute to increase the daily water exchange between the two environments. However, during the Olympics the lagoon hosted the rowing competitions and there were numerous concerns about potential infection resulting from human sewage.<ref>{{Cite news |title=For rowers in Rio's Olympic water, it's all about avoiding the splash |work=Chicago Tribune |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/international/ct-olympic-rowing-dirty-water-20160806-story.html |access-date=8 May 2017 |archive-date=20 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190320070402/https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/international/ct-olympic-rowing-dirty-water-20160806-story.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Rio has a [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'') that closely borders a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (''Am'') according to the [[Köppen climate classification]], and is often characterized by long periods of heavy rain between December and March.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Alvares |first1=Clayton Alcarde |last2=Stape |first2=José Luiz |last3=Sentelhas |first3=Paulo Cesar |last4=de Moraes Gonçalves |first4=José Leonardo |last5=Sparovek |first5=Gerd |year=2013 |title=Köppen's climate classification map for Brazil |journal=Meteorologische Zeitschrift |publisher=E.

In inland areas of the city, temperatures above {{cvt|40|°C|0}} are common during the summer, though rarely for long periods, while maximum temperatures above {{cvt|27|°C|0}} can occur on a monthly basis.

Along the coast, the breeze, blowing onshore and offshore, moderates the temperature. Because of its geographic situation, the city is often reached by cold fronts advancing from [[Antarctica]], especially during autumn and winter, causing frequent weather changes. In summer there can be strong rains, which have, on some occasions, provoked catastrophic floods and landslides. The mountainous areas register greater rainfall since they constitute a barrier to the humid wind that comes from the Atlantic.<ref>{{Cite web |title=BBC Weather – Rio de Janeiro |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/3451190 |access-date=14 May 2015 |website=BBC Weather |archive-date=1 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501091522/http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/3451190 |url-status=live }}</ref> The city has had rare [[frost]]s in the past.

Drought is very rare, albeit bound to happen occasionally given the city's strongly seasonal tropical climate. The Brazilian drought of 2014–2015, most severe in the [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast Region]] and the worst in decades, affected the entire metropolitan region's water supply (a diversion from the [[Paraíba do Sul]] River to the [[Guandu River (Rio de Janeiro)|Guandu]] River is a major source for the state's most populous mesoregion). There were plans to divert the Paraíba do Sul to the [[Sistema Cantareira]] (Cantareira system) during the water crisis of 2014 in order to help the critically drought-stricken [[Greater São Paulo]] area. However, availability of sufficient rainfall to supply tap water to both metropolitan areas in the future is merely speculative.<ref>{{Cite web |date=5 September 2014 |title=Brazil drought crisis leads to rationing and tensions |url=https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2014/sep/05/brazil-drought-crisis-rationing |access-date=2 February 2015 |website=The Guardian |archive-date=21 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220621125416/https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2014/sep/05/brazil-drought-crisis-rationing |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=23 January 2015 |title=Brazil's worst drought in history prompts protests and blackouts |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/23/brazil-worst-drought-history |access-date=2 February 2015 |archive-date=21 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220621125407/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/23/brazil-worst-drought-history |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=1 February 2015 |title=Paraíba do Sul River might not have enough water to rescue São Paulo's Sistema Cantareira |url=http://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2015/02/rio-paraiba-do-sul-pode-nao-ter-agua-para-socorrer-sistema-cantareira.html |access-date=2 February 2015 |publisher=G1 |language=pt |archive-date=21 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220621123613/https://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2015/02/rio-paraiba-do-sul-pode-nao-ter-agua-para-socorrer-sistema-cantareira.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Temperature also varies according to elevation, distance from the coast, and type of vegetation or land use. During the winter, cold fronts and dawn/morning sea breezes bring mild temperatures; cold fronts, the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (in the form of winds from the [[Amazon Forest]]), the strongest sea-borne winds (often from an [[extratropical cyclone]]) and summer [[evapotranspiration]] bring showers or storms. Thus the monsoon-like climate has dry and mild winters and springs, and very wet and warm summers and autumns. As a result, temperatures over {{cvt|40|°C|0}}, that may happen about year-round but are much more common during the summer, often mean the actual "feels-like" temperature is over {{cvt|50|°C|0}}, when there is little wind and the [[relative humidity]] percentage is high.<ref>{{Cite web |date=23 February 2010 |title=Com sensação térmica de 48°C, cariocas se refugiram do calor nas praias |trans-title=Feeling like 48°C, cariocas bathe in beaches trying to escape from the heat |url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Rio/0,,MUL1502179-5606,00-COM+SENSACAO+TERMICA+DE+C+CARIOCAS+SE+REFUGIAM+DO+CALOR+NAS+PRAIAS.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226030724/http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Rio/0%2C%2CMUL1502179-5606%2C00-COM%2BSENSACAO%2BTERMICA%2BDE%2BC%2BCARIOCAS%2BSE%2BREFUGIAM%2BDO%2BCALOR%2BNAS%2BPRAIAS.html |archive-date=26 February 2010 |access-date=25 June 2013 |publisher=G1 |language=pt}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=25 December 2012 |title=Sensação térmica no Rio de Janeiro chega a 50°C nesta terça-feira |trans-title=Rio de Janeiro will be feeling like 50°C this Tuesday |url=http://br.noticias.yahoo.com/sensa%C3%A7%C3%A3o-t%C3%A9rmica-rio-de-janeiro-chega-a-50-233457951.html |access-date=25 June 2013 |publisher=Yahoo!

Different ethnic groups contributed to the formation of the population of Rio de Janeiro. Before European colonization, there were at least seven different [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|indigenous peoples]] speaking 20 languages in the region. A part of them joined the Portuguese and the other the French. Those who joined the [[French Brazilian|French]] were then exterminated by the Portuguese, while the other part was assimilated.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tem índio no Rio |url=http://paginas.terra.com.br/educacao/Ludimila/indiosrj.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813071626/http://paginas.terra.com.br/educacao/Ludimila/indiosrj.htm |archive-date=13 August 2007 |access-date=6 May 2009 |publisher=Paginas.terra.com.br}}</ref>

The Portuguese cultural influence is still seen in many parts of the city (and many other parts of the state of Rio de Janeiro), including architecture and [[Portuguese language|language]]. Most Brazilians with some cultural contact with Rio know how to easily differentiate between the local dialect, ''fluminense'', and other Brazilian dialects. People of [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese]] ancestry predominate in most of the state. The Brazilian census of 1920 showed that 39.7% of the Portuguese who lived in Brazil lived in Rio de Janeiro. Including all of the Rio de Janeiro, the proportion raised to 46.3% of the Portuguese who lived in Brazil. The numerical presence of the Portuguese was extremely high, accounting for 72% of the foreigners who lived in the capital. Portuguese born people accounted for 20.4% of the population of Rio, and those with a Portuguese father or a Portuguese mother accounted for 30.8%. In other words, native born Portuguese and their children accounted for 51.2% of the inhabitants of Rio, or a total of 267,664 people in 1890.<ref>{{Google books |id=QPDe42CBSeMC |page=107 |title=Os lusíadas na aventura do Rio moderno }}</ref>

According to an autosomal DNA study from 2009, conducted on a school in the poor suburb of Rio de Janeiro, the "pardos" there were found to be on average about 80% European, and the "whites" (who thought of themselves as "very mixed") were found to carry very little Amerindian and/or African admixtures. The results of the tests of genomic ancestry are quite different from the self made estimates of European ancestry. In general, the test results showed that European ancestry is far more important than the students thought it would be. The "pardos" for example thought of themselves as {{frac|1|3}} European, {{frac|1|3}} African and {{frac|1|3}} Amerindian before the tests, and yet their ancestry on average reached 80% European.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Negros e pardos do Rio têm mais genes europeus do que imaginam, segundo estudo |url=http://www.meionews.com.br/index.php/noticias/21-estado-do-rio/4607-negros-e-pardos-do-rio-tem-mais-genes-europeus-do-que-imaginam-segundo-estudo.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706153557/http://www.meionews.com.br/index.php/noticias/21-estado-do-rio/4607-negros-e-pardos-do-rio-tem-mais-genes-europeus-do-que-imaginam-segundo-estudo.html |archive-date=6 July 2011 |access-date=15 September 2011 |publisher=Meionews.com.br}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Ensp.fiocruz.br/informe/anexos/ric.pdf |url=http://www4.ensp.fiocruz.br/informe/anexos/ric.pdf |access-date=23 August 2011}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Other studies showed similar results<ref name="laboratoriogene.info" /><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Durso |first1=DF |last2=Bydlowski |first2=SP |last3=Hutz |first3=MH |last4=Suarez-Kurtz |first4=G |last5=Magalhães |first5=TR |last6=Pena |first6=SD |year=2014 |title=Association of genetic variants with self-assessed color categories in Brazilians |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=e83926 |bibcode=2014PLoSO...983926D |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0083926 |pmc=3885524 |pmid=24416183|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Primary schools are largely under municipal administration, while the state plays a more significant role in the extensive network of secondary schools. There are also a small number of schools under federal administration, as is the case of Pedro II School, Colégio de Aplicação da UFRJ and the Centro Federal de Educação Tecnológica of Rio de Janeiro (CEFET-RJ). In addition, Rio has an ample offering of private schools that provide education at all levels. Rio is home to many colleges and universities.

There have been a number of government initiatives to counter this problem, from the removal of the population from favelas to [[Public housing|housing projects]] such as [[Cidade de Deus (Rio de Janeiro)|Cidade de Deus]] to the more recent approach of improving conditions in the favelas and bringing them up to par with the rest of the city, as was the focus of the "Favela Bairro" program and deployment of [[Pacifying Police Unit]]s.

Rio has more people living in slums than any other city in Brazil, according to the 2010 Census.<ref>{{Cite news |date=21 December 2011 |title=Rio é a cidade com maior população em favelas do Brasil |language=pt-BR |work=O Globo |url=https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/rio-a-cidade-com-maior-populacao-em-favelas-do-brasil-3489272 |access-date=4 August 2017 |archive-date=4 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804174103/https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/rio-a-cidade-com-maior-populacao-em-favelas-do-brasil-3489272 |url-status=dead }}</ref> More than 1,500,000 people live in its 763 favelas, 22% of Rio's total population.

In Rio de Janeiro, the executive power is represented by the mayor and the cabinet of secretaries, in accordance with the model proposed by the Federal Constitution. The Organic Law of the Municipality and the current Master Plan, however, stipulate that the public administration must provide the population with effective tools for the exercise of participatory democracy. In this way, the city is divided into subprefectures, each of which is headed by a sub-mandatory appointed directly by the mayor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cpdoc.fgv.br/producao_intelectual/arq/1232.pdf |title=O lugar da cidade do Rio de Janeiro na Federação brasileira:uma questão em três momentos |author=Marly Silva da Motta |date=2001 |publisher=[[CPDOC]]-FGV |accessdate=22 September 2012 |language=PT-br |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305031856/http://cpdoc.fgv.br/producao_intelectual/arq/1232.pdf |archive-date=5 March 2012}}</ref>

Legislative power is constituted by the municipal council, composed of 51 councilors<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.camara.rj.gov.br/vereadores_atuais.php?m1=vereadores&m2=ver_atuais&m3=por_nome |title=Current Councilors - 8th Legislature |publisher=Municipal Chamber of Rio de Janeiro |accessdate=22 September 2012 |archive-date=22 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022144545/http://www.camara.rj.gov.br/vereadores_atuais.php?m1=vereadores&m2=ver_atuais&m3=por_nome |url-status=live }}</ref> elected for four-year terms (in compliance with the provisions of article 29 of the Constitution, which disciplines a minimum number of 42 and a maximum of 55 for municipalities with more than five million inhabitants).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.senado.gov.br/atividade/const/con1988/con1988_15.09.2015/art_29_.asp |title=Constituição da República Federativa do Brasil: Artigo 29 |publisher=Senado Federal |access-date=24 October 2008 |language=PT-br |archive-date=28 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828231749/http://www.senado.gov.br/atividade/const/con1988/con1988_15.09.2015/art_29_.asp |url-status=live }}</ref> It is up to the House to prepare and vote on fundamental laws for the administration and the Executive, especially the participatory budget (Lei de Diretrizes Orçamentárias).

There are also municipal councils, which complement the legislative process and the work engendered in the secretariats. Compulsorily formed by representatives of various sectors of organized civil society, they are on different fronts — although their effective representation is sometimes questioned. The following are currently in operation: Municipal Council for the Protection of Cultural Heritage (CMPC), Defense of the Environment (CONDEMAM), Health (CMS), the Rights of Children and Adolescents (CMDCA), Education (CME), Social Assistance (CMAS) and Anti-Drugs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.camara.rj.gov.br/spldocs/pl/2001/pl0004_2001_000549.pdf |title=Projeto de lei nº 4-A/2001 |publisher=Câmara Municipal do Rio de Janeiro |date=2001 |access-date=22 September 2012 |language=PT-br |archive-date=14 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714202128/http://www.camara.rj.gov.br/spldocs/pl/2001/pl0004_2001_000549.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Federal government ===
The city of Rio de Janeiro was successively the capital of the Portuguese colony of the [[State of Brazil]] (1621–1815), after the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] (1815–1822), the [[Empire of Brazil]] (1822–1889) and from the Republic of the United States of Brazil (1889–1968) until 1960, when the seat of government was definitively transferred to the then newly built [[Brasília]].<ref name="nexo">{{Cite journal |title=Por que o Rio deveria virar um segundo Distrito Federal, segundo este pesquisador |journal=Nexo Jornal |url=https://www.nexojornal.com.br/entrevista/2017/05/04/Por-que-o-Rio-deveria-virar-um-segundo-Distrito-Federal-segundo-este-pesquisador |access-date=4 August 2022 |archive-date=11 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230211145152/https://www.nexojornal.com.br/entrevista/2017/05/04/Por-que-o-Rio-deveria-virar-um-segundo-Distrito-Federal-segundo-este-pesquisador |url-status=live }}</ref>

Despite the change in the federal capital, 59% of civil servants in the Executive Branch of federal agencies and public companies remained in the city. Rio de Janeiro is also the only Brazilian state where the number of federal employees exceeds the number of state employees. About a third of all federal public bodies and companies remain in the former capital, with 50 public offices, including agencies, autarchies, foundations and public companies, such as the [[National Library of Brazil|National Library]], the [[National Nuclear Energy Commission]], [[Fiocruz]], [[BNDES]], [[Petrobras]], [[Eletrobras]], [[IBGE]], [[Casa da Moeda do Brasil|Casa da Moeda]], the [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives]], among others.<ref name="nexo"/>

[[Zona Central, Rio de Janeiro|''Centro'' or Downtown]] is the historic core of the city, as well as its [[financial center]].

Rio de Janeiro has the second-largest [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of any city in Brazil, surpassed only by [[São Paulo]]. According to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]], it was approximately US$201&nbsp;billion in 2008, equivalent to 5.1% of the national total. Taking into consideration the network of influence exerted by the urban [[metropolis]] (which covers 11.3% of the population), this share in GDP rises to 14.4%, according to a study released in October 2008 by the IBGE.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of economy |url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/presidencia/noticias/29092003estatisticasecxxhtml.shtm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103124742/http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/presidencia/noticias/29092003estatisticasecxxhtml.shtm |archive-date=3 January 2010 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Ibge.gov.br}}</ref>

Benefiting from the federal capital position it had for a long period (1763–1960), the city became a dynamic administrative, financial, commercial and cultural center. Rio de Janeiro became an attractive place for companies to locate when it was the capital of Brazil, as important sectors of society and of the government were present in the city. The city was chosen as headquarters for [[Public property|state-owned]] companies such as [[Petrobras]], [[Eletrobras]], [[Caixa Econômica Federal]], [[Brazilian Development Bank|National Economic and Social Development Bank]] and [[Vale (mining company)|Vale]] (which was privatized in the 1990s). The [[Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange]] (BVRJ), which currently trades only government securities, was the first stock exchange founded in Brazil in 1845.

The off-shore oil exploration in the [[Campos Basin]] began in 1968 and became the main site for oil production of Brazil. This caused many oil and gas companies to be based in Rio de Janeiro, such as the Brazilian branches of [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], [[EBX Group|EBX]] and [[Esso]]. For many years Rio was the second largest industrial hub of Brazil,<ref>{{Cite web |title=IBGE – Economy of Rio de Janeiro |url=http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/bda/tabela/listabl.asp?z=cd&o=17&i=P&c=793 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Sidra.ibge.gov.br |archive-date=14 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614223617/http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/bda/tabela/listabl.asp?z=cd&o=17&i=P&c=793 |url-status=live }}</ref> with [[oil refineries]], shipbuilding industries, steel, [[metallurgy]], petrochemicals, cement, [[pharmaceutic]]al, textile, processed foods and furniture industries.

Major international pharmaceutical companies have their Brazilian headquarters in Rio such as: [[Merck KGaA|Merck]], [[Roche Applied Science|Roche]], Arrow, Darrow, [[Baxter International|Baxter]], Mayne, and Mappel.

====Public transportation====
[[File:Public transport map of Rio de Janeiro.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Public transport map of Rio de Janeiro]]

In Rio de Janeiro, buses are the main form of [[public transportation]]. There are nearly 440 municipal bus lines serving over four million passengers every day, in addition to intercity lines. Although cheap and frequent, Rio's transportation policy has been moving towards trains and subway in order to reduce surface congestion and increase carrier capacity. Rio's public transportation service has been a target of many critics and the motive of the 2013's protests and manifestations that started in São Paulo and spread through the entire country. According to the people, the raise in the bus and subway fares are invalid, seeing that the amount charged is too high for the low quality of the services.

=====Ferry=====
[[File:Barca_Pão_de_Açúcar_(2).jpg|thumb|Rio de Janeiro ferry]]

The most geographically close sister city to Rio that is on the other side of [[Guanabara Bay]] is [[Niterói]]. Many people who live in Niterói, as well its neighboring municipalities [[São Gonçalo, Rio de Janeiro|São Gonçalo]] and [[Maricá]], commute to Rio de Janeiro to study and work. There are several ferry services that operate between the Rio Centro ([[Praça XV Station|Praça XV]]) and Niterói (Centro and Charitas). There is a traditional boat as well as several "fast cat" [[hydrofoil]] boats. One of the city neighborhoods is [[Paquetá Island]], which can only be accessed by ferryboats or hydrofoil boats. The ferryboat to Paquetá leaves every hour, from early in the morning until around midnight. There is also a ferry to [[Cocotá]].

=====Buses=====
{{main|Bus transport in Rio de Janeiro}}
[[File:Rio 01 2013 TransOeste 5811.JPG|thumb|[[TransOeste]] Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)]]

City buses, which come in both non-air conditioned and air conditioned versions, cost about R$4,30 to ride.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-12-30 |title=Passagem de ônibus municipal no Rio passa para R$ 4,30 |url=https://g1.globo.com/rj/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2022/12/30/passagem-de-onibus-municipal-no-rio-passa-para-r-430.ghtml |access-date=2023-05-19 |website=G1 |language=pt-br |archive-date=19 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230519120520/https://g1.globo.com/rj/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2022/12/30/passagem-de-onibus-municipal-no-rio-passa-para-r-430.ghtml |url-status=live }}</ref> The system may be relatively safe by day but less so at night.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bus – Transportation in Rio |url=http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g303506-s303/Rio-De-Janeiro:Brazil:Public.Transportation.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821124132/http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g303506-s303/Rio-De-Janeiro:Brazil:Public.Transportation.html |archive-date=21 August 2010 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Tripadvisor}}</ref> Integration of bus lines has been recently implemented, allowing users to take two non-air conditioned bus rides in two hours paying just one ticket. It is necessary to have a registered electronic card (the "''Bilhete Único Carioca (BUC)''") in order to benefit of this system.

Another type of local bus is called the "''Frescão''" (air-conditioned). These buses run several routes, the main being from Centro through Botafogo, Copacabana and Ipanema to Leblon (and vice versa), and from the International Airport to Barra, through the beach road. They are air conditioned – about {{cvt|22|°C|0}} – more upscale/comfortable and cost between R$13.35–R$19.95.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-02-15 |title=Secretaria de Transportes autoriza reajuste da tarifa de ônibus 'frescão' |url=https://prefeitura.rio/transportes/secretaria-de-transportes-autoriza-reajuste-da-tarifa-de-onibus-frescao/ |access-date=2023-05-19 |website=Prefeitura da Cidade do Rio de Janeiro - prefeitura.rio |language=pt-BR |archive-date=19 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230519120522/https://prefeitura.rio/transportes/secretaria-de-transportes-autoriza-reajuste-da-tarifa-de-onibus-frescao/ |url-status=live }}</ref> However, it is only available during weekdays. The buses also run more frequently during the rush hours in the morning and evening. Going in the direction of Centro (city center), the bus can be flagged down on the beach road (buses with plaques showing "Castelo").

====Road transport====
[[File:Bridge_to_Niteroi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rio-Niterói Bridge]]]]
Driving in Rio de Janeiro, as in most large cities of Brazil, might not be the best choice because of the large car numbers. The city is served by a number of expressways, like Linha Vermelha, Linha Amarela, [[Avenida Brasil (Rio de Janeiro)|Avenida Brasil]], Avenida das Américas and Avenida Infante Dom Henrique ([[Aterro do Flamengo]]); in spite of this, traffic jams are very common.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Driving in Rio de Janeiro |url=http://www.rioholiday.com/Driving-in-Rio-de-Janeiro.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524065912/http://www.rioholiday.com/Driving-in-Rio-de-Janeiro.htm |archive-date=24 May 2009 |access-date=6 May 2009 |publisher=Rioholiday.com}}</ref> Because of the organization of the [[2016 Olympics]] the city is installing four [[Bus rapid transit|BRT]] systems to link [[Barra da Tijuca]] with other major neighborhoods: [[TransOlimpica]] (between Barra and [[Deodoro (Rio de Janeiro)|Deodoro]]); TransBrasil (over the [[Avenida Brasil (Rio de Janeiro)|Avenida Brasil]] expressway); [[TransCarioca]] (between Barra and the Galeão International Airport); and [[TransOeste]] (between Barra and [[Santa Cruz, Rio de Janeiro|Santa Cruz]], over Avenida das Américas).

In Brazil, most interstate transportation is done by road. A large terminal for long-distance buses is in the Santo Cristo neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. There are also two port facilities for cargo and passenger ships (Rio de Janeiro and [[Sepetiba]] port). Rio has roads to all neighbor [[States of Brazil|States]]. Some roads (like [[Rodovia Presidente Dutra|Via Dutra]], to São Paulo, and a stretch of the BR-101 which covers the Rio-Niterói bridge) were chartered to private enterprises. The quality of the highways improved much, but was accompanied by a significant increase of the toll fees. From [[São Paulo]]: take the BR-116 (Presidente Dutra Federal Highway) or the [[Brazilian Highway System|BR-101]] (Rio-Santos Federal Highway). From [[Belo Horizonte]]: BR-040. From [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]]: BR-101 or [[BR-324]]/BR-116/BR-393/BR-040.

====Bicycles====

The city has {{cvt|160|km|mi}} of cycle paths that, wherever they exist, are very much preferable to riding in the city's traffic. Most paths run alongside beaches and extend intermittently from the [[Marina da Glória]], Centro, through Flamengo, Copacabana and Ipanema, to Barra da Tijuca and Recreio dos Bandeirantes. {{cvt|6|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off|sp=us}} of cycle paths traverse the [[Tijuca Forest|Tijuca National Park]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Getting around Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Worldtravelguide.net |url=http://www.worldtravelguide.net/city/104/getting_around/South-America/Rio-de-Janeiro.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127043742/http://www.worldtravelguide.net/city/104/getting_around/South-America/Rio-de-Janeiro.html |archive-date=27 January 2010 |access-date=17 April 2010}}</ref>

The [[Bike Rio]] began operations in October 2011. This [[bicycle sharing system]] is sponsored by the municipal government of Rio de Janeiro in partnership with [[Itaú Unibanco|Banco Itaú]].

Rio de Janeiro is a main cultural hub in Brazil. Its architecture embraces churches and buildings dating from the 16th to the 19th centuries, blending with the world-renowned designs of the 20th century. Rio was home to the [[Portugal|Portuguese Imperial family]] and capital of the country for many years, and was influenced by [[Architecture of Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Architecture of England|English]], and [[French architecture]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=FBN Summit |url=http://www.fbnsummit.org/2013/brazil-and-the-city-of-rio/ |access-date=14 May 2015 |archive-date=8 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150308075623/http://www.fbnsummit.org/2013/brazil-and-the-city-of-rio/ |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Rio de Janeiro has inherited a strong cultural role from the past. In the late 19th century, there were sessions held of the first Brazilian film and since then, several production cycles have spread out, eventually placing Rio at the forefront of experimental and national cinema. The [[Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival]]<ref>festivaldorio.com.br</ref> has been held annually since 1999.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival |website=[[IMDb]] |url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0001488/overview |access-date=14 May 2015 |archive-date=11 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711073711/http://www.imdb.com/event/ev0001488/overview |url-status=live }}</ref>

After Brazilian independence from Portugal in 1822, Rio de Janeiro quickly developed a [[Culture of Europe|European-style]] bourgeois cultural life, including numerous newspapers, in which most 19th-century novels were initially published in serial. [[Joaquim Manuel de Macedo]]'s ''[[A Moreninha (novel)|A Moreninha]]'' (1844) was perhaps the first successful novel in Brazil and inaugurates a recurrent 19th-century theme: a romantic relationship between idealistic young people in spite of cruelties of social fortune.

The first notable work of realism focusing on the urban [[lower middle class|lower-middle class]] is [[Manuel Antônio de Almeida]]'s ''[[Memórias de um sargento de milícias]]'' (1854), which presents a series of picaresque scenes, and evokes the transformation of a town into a city with suggestive nostalgia. Romantic and realist modes both flourished through the late 19th century and often overlapped within works.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Piers Armstrong |title=Rio's novel history |url=http://cco.cambridge.org/extract?id=ccol0521825334_CCOL0521825334A008 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Cco.cambridge.org |archive-date=11 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511181501/http://cco.cambridge.org/extract?id=ccol0521825334_CCOL0521825334A008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Machado de Assis]] is from Rio de Janeiro, and is widely regarded as the greatest writer of [[Brazilian literature]]<ref>[[Antonio Candido|Candido; Antonio.]] (1970) ''Vários escritos.''

The headquarters of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]] is based in Rio de Janeiro. It was satirized by the novelist [[Jorge Amado]] in ''[[Pen, Sword, Camisole]]''. Amado, himself, went on to be one of the 40 members of the academy.

The Biblioteca Nacional ([[National Library of Brazil]]) ranks as one of the largest libraries in the world.

As with many of Rio de Janeiro's cultural monuments, the library was originally off-limits to the general public. The most valuable collections in the library include: 4,300 items donated by Barbosa Machado including a precious collection of rare brochures detailing the [[History of Portugal]] and [[History of Brazil|Brazil]]; 2,365 items from the 17th and 18th centuries that were previously owned by Antônio de Araújo de Azevedo, the "Count of Barca", including the 125-volume set of prints "Le Grand Théâtre de l'Univers;" a collection of documents regarding the Jesuítica Province of Paraguay and the "Region of Prata;" and the Teresa Cristina Maria Collection, donated by [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II]]. The collection contains 48,236 items.

The Real Gabinete Português de Leitura (Portuguese Royal Reading Library) is located at Rua Luís de Camões, in the Centro (Downtown). The institution was founded in 1837 by a group of forty-three [[Portuguese people|Portuguese immigrants]], [[political refugee]]s, to promote culture among the Portuguese community in the then capital of the Empire. The history of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]] is linked to the Real Gabinete, since some of the early meetings of the academy were held there.<ref>{{Cite web |date=28 May 2011 |title=Um pedaço de Portugal no Rio de Janeiro – Opinião e Notícia |url=http://opiniaoenoticia.com.br/cultura/um-pedaco-de-portugal-no-rio-de-janeiro/ |website=opiniaoenoticia.com.br |access-date=25 March 2016 |archive-date=24 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424062952/http://opiniaoenoticia.com.br/cultura/um-pedaco-de-portugal-no-rio-de-janeiro/ |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The official song of Rio de Janeiro is "[[Cidade Maravilhosa]]", which means "marvelous city". The song is considered the civic anthem of Rio, and is always the favorite song during Rio's [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnival]] in February. Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, are considered the center of the [[urban contemporary|urban music]] movement in Brazil.<ref>Behague, Gerard. "Rap, Reggae, Rock, or Samba: The Local and the Global in [[Música popular brasileira|Brazilian Popular Music]] (1985–1995)." [[Latin American music|Latin American Music]] Review 27, no. 1 (Spring/Summer 2006): 79–90</ref>

"Rio was popularized by the hit song "[[The Girl from Ipanema]]", composed by [[Antônio Carlos Jobim]] and [[Vinicius de Moraes]] and recorded by [[Astrud Gilberto]] and [[João Gilberto]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and [[Ella Fitzgerald]]. It is also the main key song of the [[bossa nova]], a [[music genre]] born in Rio. A genre unique to Rio and Brazil as a whole is [[Funk carioca|Funk Carioca]]. While [[samba]] music continues to act as the national unifying agent in Rio, Funk Carioca found a strong community following in Brazil. With its genesis in the 1970s as the modern black pop music from the United States, it evolved in the 1990s to describe a variety of [[electronic music]] associated with the current US [[African-American music|black music]] scene, including [[hip hop]], modern soul, and [[house music]]."<ref>Sansone, Livio. "The Localization of Global Funk in Bahia and Rio." In Brazilian Popular Music & Globalization, 135–60. London: Routledge, 2002.</ref>

Brazil's return to democracy in 1985 allowed for a new music expression which promoted creativity and experimentation in expressive culture, in a wave of Rock'n'roll that swept the 80s. [[Lobão (musician)|Lobão]] emerged as the most legendary rocker in Brazil.<ref>{{Cite web |date=24 February 2004 |title=Rio de Janeiro Carnival |url=https://www.carnivaland.net/rio-de-janeiro-carnival/ |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=carnivaland.net |archive-date=30 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530184445/https://www.carnivaland.net/rio-de-janeiro-carnival/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Commercial and cultural imports from Europe and North America have often influenced Brazil's own cultural output. For example, the hip hop that has stemmed from New York is localized into forms of musical production such as Funk Carioca and [[Brazilian hip hop]].

Rio de Janeiro's [[Theatro Municipal (Rio de Janeiro)|Theatro Municipal]] is one of the most attractive buildings in the central area of the city. Home of one of the largest stages in Latin America and one of Brazil's best-known venues for opera, ballet, and classical music, the building was inspired by the [[Palais Garnier]], home of the [[Paris Opera]]. Construction of the Theatro Municipal began in 1905 following designs of the architect Francisco Pereira Passos. The statues on the top, of two women representing Poetry and Music, are by [[Rodolfo Bernardelli]], and the interior is rich with furnishings and fine paintings. Inaugurated in 1909, the Teatro Municipal has close to 1,700 seats. Its interior includes turn of the century stained glass from France, ceilings of rose-colored marble and a 1,000&nbsp;pound crystal bead chandelier surrounded by a painting of the "[[Dance of the Hours]]". The exterior walls of the building are dotted with inscriptions bearing the names of famous Brazilians as well as many other international celebrities.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Teatro Municipal do Rio |url=http://www.rio-de-janeiro.info/teatro-municipal.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406222751/http://www.rio-de-janeiro.info/teatro-municipal.htm |archive-date=6 April 2010 |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Rio-de-janeiro.info}}</ref>

[[Cidade da Música|Cidade das Artes]] (City of Arts) is a cultural complex in Barra da Tijuca in the Southwest Zone of Rio de Janeiro, which was originally planned to open in 2004. Formally known as "Cidade da Música" (City of Music), it was finally inaugurated at the beginning of 2013.
The project will host the Brazilian Symphony Orchestra becoming a main center for music as will be the largest modern concert hall in South America, with 1,780 seats. The complex spans approximately {{cvt|90|e3m2|e6ft2|0|abbr=off|sp=us}} and also features a chamber music hall, three theaters, and 12 rehearsal rooms. From the terrace there is a panoramic view of the zone. The building was designed by the French architect [[Christian de Portzamparc]] and construction was funded by the city of Rio de Janeiro.

A series of covered theaters collectively known as [[Lona Cultural]], administered by the city's Municipal Secretary of Culture, serve throughout the city as venues for cultural activities such as concerts, plays, workshops, art and craft fairs, and courses.

Every 31 December, 2.5&nbsp;million people gather at [[Copacabana Beach]] to celebrate New Year's in Rio de Janeiro. The crowd, mostly dressed in white, celebrates all night at the hundreds of different shows and events along the beach. It is the second-largest celebration only next to the [[Rio Carnival|Carnival]]. People celebrate the New Year by sharing chilled champagne.

[[Rio Carnival]] is an annual celebration in the Roman Catholic tradition that allows merry-making and red meat consumption before the more sober 40&nbsp;days of Lent penance which culminates with Holy or Passion Week and Easter. The tradition of Carnaval parades was probably influenced by the French or German courts and the custom was brought by the Portuguese or Brazilian Imperial families who had French and Austrian German ancestors. Up until the time of the [[marchinha]]s, the revelry was more of a high class and Caucasian-led event. The influence of the African-Brazilian drums and music became more noticeable from the first half of the 20th century. Rio de Janeiro has many Carnaval choices, including the [[samba school]] (''Escolas de Samba)''<ref>{{Cite book |last=Castro Brunetto |first=Carlos Javier |title=Between categories, beyond boundaries: Arte, ciudad e identidad |publisher=Libargo |year=2013 |isbn=978-84-938812-9-0 |location=Granada |pages=112–130 |chapter=Arte popular y estética contemporánea en las escuelas de samba de Río de Janeiro}}</ref> parades in the [[Sambadrome Marquês de Sapucaí|sambadrome]] exhibition center and the popular ''[[Carnival block|blocos de carnaval]]'', street revelry, which parade in almost every corner of the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cordão do Bola Preta in Rio |url=http://carnaval.uol.com.br/noticias/riodejaneiro/2008/02/02/ult5681u63.jhtm |access-date=17 April 2010 |publisher=Carnaval.uol.com.br |archive-date=6 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706154915/http://carnaval.uol.com.br/noticias/riodejaneiro/2008/02/02/ult5681u63.jhtm |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1840, the first Carnival was celebrated with a masked ball.
