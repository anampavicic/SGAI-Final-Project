'''Salem''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|eɪ|l|ə|m}} {{respell|SAY|ləm}}) is the [[List of capitals in the United States|capital city]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]], and the [[county seat]] of [[Marion County, Oregon|Marion County]]. It is located in the center of the [[Willamette Valley]] alongside the [[Willamette River]], which runs north through the city. The river forms the boundary between Marion and [[Polk County, Oregon|Polk]] counties, and the city neighborhood of [[West Salem, Salem, Oregon|West Salem]] is in Polk County. Salem was founded in 1842, became the capital of the [[Oregon Territory]] in 1851, and was incorporated in 1857.

Salem had a population of 175,535 at the [[2020 United States Census|2020 census]],<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/salemcityoregon/POP010220|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Salem city, Oregon|website=www.census.gov|access-date=February 12, 2023}}</ref> making it the [[List of cities in Oregon|third-most populous city]] in the state after [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]].

The city is home to [[Willamette University]], [[Corban University]], and [[Chemeketa Community College]]. The [[Government of Oregon|State of Oregon]] is the largest public employer in the city, and [[Salem Health (Oregon)|Salem Health]] is the largest private employer. Transportation includes public transit from [[Cherriots]] (legally known as Salem Area Mass Transit District), [[Salem (Amtrak station)|Amtrak service]], as well as limited commercial and non-commercial air travel at [[McNary Field]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Salem Municipal Airport {{!}} Salem, Oregon |url=https://www.cityofsalem.net/community/transportation-getting-around/salem-municipal-airport |access-date=2023-11-10 |website=www.cityofsalem.net |language=en}}</ref> Major roads include [[Interstate 5 in Oregon|Interstate 5]], [[Oregon Route 99E]], and [[Oregon Route 22]], which connects West Salem across the Willamette River via the [[Marion Street Bridge|Marion Street]] and [[Center Street Bridge|Center Street]] bridges.

==History==

===Origin of name===
[[File:SalemOregon1876.gif|thumb|left|Map of Salem in 1876]]
The Native Americans who inhabited the central Willamette Valley at first European contact, the [[Kalapuya people|Kalapuya]], called the area Chim-i-ki-ti, which means "meeting or resting place" in the [[Central Kalapuya language]] (Santiam).<ref>Johnson, Tony, Language Education Supervisor, CTGR Cultural Resources Division</ref> When the [[Methodist Mission]] moved to the area, they called the new establishment Chemeketa; although it was more widely known as the Mill, because of its situation on [[Mill Creek (Marion County, Oregon)|Mill Creek]].<ref name=OGN>{{cite book

When the institute was dissolved, the trustees decided to lay out a town site on the Institute lands.<ref name=OGN/> Some possible sources for the name "Salem" include [[William H. Willson]], who in 1850 and 1851 filed the plans for the main part of the city, and suggested adopting an Anglicized version of the [[Biblical Hebrew]] word "שָׁלוֹם, Shalom", meaning "peace" (used also as a greeting).<ref name=OGN/><ref name="SPL">{{cite web | title = How Salem Got its Name | publisher = Salem Public Library, Salem, Oregon | url = http://www.salemhistory.net/brief_history/salem_name.htm | access-date = March 25, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180409092113/http://www.salemhistory.net/brief_history/salem_name.htm | archive-date = April 9, 2018 | url-status = live }}</ref> The Reverend [[David Leslie (Oregon politician)|David Leslie]], President of the town's Trustees, also wanted a Biblical name, and suggested using the last five letters of "Jerusalem".<ref name="SPL"/> Or, the town may be named after [[Salem, Massachusetts]], where Leslie was educated.

===Europeans===
The first people of European descent arrived in the area as early as 1812; they were animal trappers and food gatherers for the fur trading companies in [[Astoria, Oregon]].

The first permanent American settlement in the area was the [[Jason Lee (missionary)|Jason Lee]] Methodist mission (1840) located in the area north of Salem known as [[Wheatland, Oregon|Wheatland]].<ref name=SOH>{{Cite web|url=http://www.salemhistory.net/brief_history/brief_history.htm|title=Salem (Oregon) Online History - Brief History|website=www.salemhistory.net|access-date=December 8, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928031339/http://www.salemhistory.net/brief_history/brief_history.htm|archive-date=September 28, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1842, the missionaries established the [[Oregon Institute]] (the forerunner of [[Willamette University]]) in the area that was to become the site of Salem. In 1844, the mission was dissolved and the town site established.

In 1851, Salem became the territorial capital after it was moved from [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]]. The capital was moved briefly to [[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]] in 1855, but was moved back to Salem permanently that same year. Salem incorporated as a city in 1857, and with the coming of statehood in 1859, it became the state capital.

===Capitol buildings===
[[File:1935 Capitol Fire.png|thumb|right|Capitol building after 1935 fire]]
Oregon has had three capitol buildings in Salem. A two-story state house, which had been occupied for only two months, burned to the ground in December 1855. Oregon's second capitol building was completed in 1876 on the site of the original. The [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]]-style building was based in part on the [[U.S. Capitol building]]. The building received its distinctive copper dome in 1893. On April 25, 1935, this building was also destroyed by fire. The third and current [[Oregon State Capitol]] was completed on the same site in 1938. It faces north instead of west like its predecessor, and is recognizable by its distinctive pioneer statue atop the capitol dome that is plated with gold-leaf and officially named the ''[[Oregon Pioneer]]''.

===State fair and cherry festival===
[[File:1867 Oregon State Fair.png|thumb|left|Oregon State Fair 1867]]
Agriculture has always been important to Salem, and the city has historically recognized and celebrated it in a number of ways. In 1861, Salem was chosen as the permanent site of the [[Oregon State Fair]] by the Oregon State Agricultural Association.<ref name=Heine>Heine, Steven Robert [https://books.google.com/books?id=UY1bWuRoaswC&pg=PA130&dq=The+Oregon+State+Fair+Images+of+America&sig=0R6dJjCQh4mFCGyGqCB0XFTcpgs#PPP1, M1 ''The Oregon State Fair Images of America''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120071331/https://books.google.com/books?id=UY1bWuRoaswC&pg=PA130&dq=The+Oregon+State+Fair+Images+of+America&sig=0R6dJjCQh4mFCGyGqCB0XFTcpgs#PPP1, |date=January 20, 2016 }} Arcadia Publishing August 20, 2007</ref> Salem is nicknamed the "Cherry City", because of the past importance of the local [[cherry]]-growing industry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.salemhistory.net/commerce/cherries.htm |title=The Cherry City |access-date=August 5, 2007 |author=Lucas, Bill |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811051110/http://www.salemhistory.net/commerce/cherries.htm |archive-date=August 11, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> The first cherry festival in Salem was held in 1903 and was an annual event, with parades and the election of a cherry queen, until sometime after World War I.

==Geography and climate==
Salem is located in the north-central [[Willamette Valley]], in [[Marion County, Oregon|Marion]] and [[Polk County, Oregon|Polk]] counties. The [[45th parallel north|45th Parallel]] (roughly the halfway point between the [[North Pole]] and the [[Equator]]) passes through Salem's city limits.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|48.45|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|47.90|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.55|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name="Gazetteer files">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=December 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archive-date=July 2, 2012 }}</ref>

Although the [[Willamette River]] flows through Salem, the [[North Santiam River]] [[drainage basin|watershed]] is Salem's primary drinking water source. Other important streams that pass through Salem are [[Mill Creek (Marion County, Oregon)|Mill Creek]], the Mill Race, [[Pringle Creek (Willamette River tributary)|Pringle Creek]], and [[Shelton Ditch (Oregon)|Shelton Ditch]].<ref name=Creeks>{{cite web |url=http://www.salemhistory.net/natural_history/salems_creeks.htm |title=The Creeks of Salem |publisher=Salem Online History |access-date=January 31, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213041930/http://www.salemhistory.net/natural_history/salems_creeks.htm |archive-date=December 13, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> Smaller streams in the southern and southeastern parts of the city include Clark Creek, Jory Creek, Battle Creek, Croisan Creek, and Claggett Creek, while Glen Creek and Brush Creek flow through [[West Salem, Salem, Oregon|West Salem]].<ref name=Creeks/>

Elevation within the city limits ranges from about {{convert|120|to|800|ft|m}}. Salem contains the volcanic [[Salem Hills]] in the south and is sandwiched by the {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}} Eola Hills directly to the west and the {{convert|600|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Waldo Hills]] to the east. Northern and eastern Salem are less hilly. South and West Salem contain some canyons and are the hilliest areas. The [[Oregon Coast Range|coast range]] and the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]]—including [[Mount Hood]], [[Mount Jefferson (Oregon)|Mount Jefferson]], and on the clearest of days, [[Mount St. Helens]] and [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]] in Washington—can be viewed from throughout the city.

[[File:Monthly Climate Normals (1991-2020) - Salem Area, OR(ThreadEx).svg|thumb|right|Climate chart for Salem]]
Like most of the Willamette Valley area, Salem has a [[Mediterranean climate|mediterranean]] climate ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csb''). Rain is heaviest in late fall and throughout winter, and almost all of the annual precipitation falls between October and April, with a dry season from May through September. Light snowfall occurs in winter, but major snows are rare. Mostly cloudy skies and low cloud ceilings are commonplace during the rainy season.

Salem's mean annual temperature is {{convert|54.1|°F|1}};<ref name= NOAA>{{cite web |url = https://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=pqr |title = NowData – NOAA Online Weather Data |publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |access-date = February 21, 2012 }}</ref> its annual precipitation is {{convert|40.08|in|mm|0}}, with an average {{convert|3.5|in|cm|1}} of snow included. However, over a quarter of years receive no snowfall.<ref name = NOAA/> The state capital is about {{convert|47|mi|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], but actually has a lower average temperature than that of Portland ({{convert|54.4|°F|1|disp=or}}),<ref name = NOAA/> due in part to the lower daily minima.

All-time extremes in Salem range from {{convert|117|to|-12|F|C}}.<ref name = NOAA/> The coldest afternoon of the year usually falls to {{convert|32|F|C}} on the freezing point, whereas the coldest recorded maximum temperature was {{convert|16|F|C}} in three separate months and years.<ref name = NOAA/> The warmest night on record was {{convert|74|F|C}} in July 2006 and the warmest annual night averages {{convert|64|F|C}}.<ref name = NOAA/>
