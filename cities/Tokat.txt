'''Tokat''' is a city of [[Turkey]] in the mid-[[Black Sea]] region of [[Anatolia]]. It is the seat of [[Tokat Province]] and [[Tokat District]].<ref name=il>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx İl Belediyesi], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory. Retrieved 22 May 2023.</ref> Its population is 163,405 (2022).<ref name=tuik>{{Cite web |title=Address-based population registration system (ADNKS) results dated 31 December 2022, Favorite Reports|url=https://biruni.tuik.gov.tr/medas/?kn=95&locale=en |access-date=22 May 2023|publisher=[[TÜİK]]|language=en|format=XLS}}</ref> It is located at the confluence of the Tokat River (Tokat Suyu) with the [[Yeşilırmak (river)|Yeşilırmak]].

== History ==
[[File:Tokat Kale.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tokat Castle]] seen from below.]]
The city was established in the [[Hittites|Hittite]] era. During the time of King [[Mithradates VI of Pontus]], it was one of his many strongholds in [[Asia Minor]].

Known as '''Evdokia''' or '''Eudoxia''',{{efn|The town was called "Tokation", then it was renamed to Evdokia (Evdoksia), after Byzantine Emperor [[Heraclius]]' daughter, [[Eudoxia Epiphania]].<ref name="pontosworld">{{cite web |url=https://pontosworld.com/index.php/pontus/places/212-tokat-tokat |title=Tokat - Τοκάτη |website=pontosworld.com |date=5 February 2017 }}</ref>}} ecclesiastically it was later incorporated into the western part of the Byzantine Greek [[Empire of Trebizond]].

Some authors like [[Guillaume de Jerphanion]]<ref name="Grégoire 1935">{{cite journal |last1=Grégoire |first1=Henri |title=Dazmana est bien Dazimon |journal=Byzantion |date=1935 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=760–3 |jstor=44169796 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44169796 |access-date=4 February 2022}}</ref> and [[William Mitchell Ramsay]]<ref name="Ramsay 1890">{{cite book |last1=Ramsay |first1=William Mitchell |title=The Historical Geography of Asia Minor |date=1890 |location=London |pages=329–30 |url=https://archive.org/details/historicalgeogra01rams/page/n367 |access-date=4 February 2022}}</ref> identified Tokat with the ancient and medieval Dazimon, with Ramsay saying, "Dazimon, which seems to have been a fortress, must have been the modern Tokat, with its strong castle.<ref name="Ramsay 1890"/> 

[[Henri Grégoire (historian)|Henri Grégoire]], on the other hand, refuted this as implausible, because a 13th-century text written by [[Ibn Bibi]] clearly distinguishes Dazimon and Tokat as separate places.<ref name="Grégoire 1935"/> Instead, he said, Tokat should be identified with the town of '''Dokeia''' ({{langx|el|Δόκεια}}) mentioned in another 10th-century text, by [[Theophanes Continuatus]], which says that the Byzantine general [[John Kourkouas]] was born in a village near Dokeia sometime in the 9th century.<ref name="Grégoire 1935"/> According to Grégoire, the name "Dokeia" does not have a Greek etymology and probably represents an old [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] place name.<ref name="Grégoire 1935"/> The supposed derivation from "Eudokia", he claimed, is only a [[folk etymology]] that came much later.<ref name="Grégoire 1935"/>

After the [[Battle of Manzikert]] the town, like most of [[Asia Minor]], came under the control of the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Turks]]. After the death of Sultan [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish]] in 1086, the [[Emir]] [[Danishmend Gazi]] took control of the area, operating from his power base in the town of Sivas. It would be many decades before the [[Seljuks]] re-took control of that region, in the reign of [[Kilij Arslan II]]. After the [[Battle of Köse Dağ]], Seljuk hold over the region was lost, and local Emirs such as the [[Eretnids|Eretna]] took power until the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], who captured the town in 1392 under Sultan [[Bayazid I]].<ref name="pontosworld"/>

Prior to the [[late Ottoman genocides]], Tokat had 40,000 residents of which included 15,000 Armenians, 1,000 Greeks, and a small number of Jews.<ref name="pontosworld"/>

== Climate ==
Tokat has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]], or alternatively a [[continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa,'' [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Dc''). Due to the relatively high altitude and inland location, winters are fairly cold with average lows below the freezing point and significant snowfall.

{{quote|The town was notorious for its textile industry and its copper manufacturing plants which were reliant on the Kempan Maden mine, a mine which has since been depleted but which in the prior century kept 600 factories in operation.|source=<ref name="pontosworld"/>}}

Foods distinctive to Tokat include Tokat kebabı and [[Zile]] [[pekmez]]i, the latter being served in a wooden pot. ''Tokat kebabı'' consists of sliced lamb, aubergines, potatoes, green bell peppers and tomatoes. The slices are laid on their sides in rows in a dish and baked with cloves of garlic.<ref>{{YouTube |_krOBKf-IXk|Tokat Kebabı}}</ref> ''Zile pekmezi'' is a grape-molasses confection, prepared from a variety of small green grapes, which are pressed (traditionally by foot but nowadays by machine) and then evaporated to a thick syrup by boiling. Egg-whites are then beaten into the syrup until it forms a pale marshmallow-like paste. It is sold commercially in tubs.<ref>[http://zilehabercom.blogspot.in/2011/06/zile-pekmezi_19.html "Zile pekmezi"], Zile haber (Commerce of Zile), Tokat, Turkey (Turkish)</ref>
