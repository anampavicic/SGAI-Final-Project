The '''Central Region''' of [[Malawi]], population 7,523,340 (2018), covers an area of 35,592&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Its capital city is [[Lilongwe]], which is also the national capital. The region has an outlet on [[Lake Malawi]] and borders neighbouring countries [[Zambia]] and [[Mozambique]]. The [[Chewa people]] make up the majority of the population today.

==Geography==
The Central region is bounded on the north by the [[Northern Region, Malawi|Northern Region]], on the east by [[Lake Malawi]], on the southeast by [[Southern Region, Malawi|Southern Region]], on the southwest by [[Mozambique]], and on east by [[Zambia]].

Central Region straddles the western edge of the [[East African Rift]]. Lake Malawi occupies most of the rift valley, with a narrow plain running along its western shore. Much of the region lies on a plateau, known as the Central Region Plateau or Lilongwe Plain. The plateau covers 23,310 square km (9,000 square miles). A belt of hills and escarpments separates the plateau from the rift valley lowlands to the east.<ref>"Central Region Plateau." ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' online. Accessed 1 September 2019. [https://www.britannica.com/place/Central-Region-Plateau]</ref> The [[Dwangwa River|Dwangwa]], Bua, and [[Lilongwe River|Lilongwe]] rivers drain the plateau, emptying eastwards into Lake Malawi.

The southwestern boundary of the region is mountainous, including the northern end of the [[Kirk Range]] and [[Dedza Mountain]] (2,198 m).

== Administration ==
Of the 27 [[Districts of Malawi|districts]] in Malawi, 9 are located within the Central Region They are: [[Dedza District|Dedza]], [[Dowa District|Dowa]], [[Kasungu District|Kasungu]], [[Lilongwe District|Lilongwe]], [[Mchinji District|Mchinji]], [[Nkhotakota District|Nkhotakota]], [[Ntcheu District|Ntcheu]], [[Ntchisi District|Ntchisi]], and [[Salima District|Salima]].
