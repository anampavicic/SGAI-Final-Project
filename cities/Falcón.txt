'''Falcón State''' ({{langx|es|link=no|Estado Falcón}}, {{IPA|es|esˈtaðo falˈkon|IPA}}) is one of the 23 [[States of Venezuela|states of Venezuela]]. The [[state capital]] is [[Coro, Venezuela|Coro]].

The state was named after [[Juan Crisóstomo Falcón]].

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2022}}
=== Early history ===
Present day Falcón State was first explored in 1499 by [[Juan de la Cosa]] and [[Américo Vespucio]], as part of an expedition supervised by [[Alonso de Ojeda]]. In 1527, the city of Coro was founded by [[Juan Martínez de Ampiés|Juan Ampíes]], who named it "[[Coro, Venezuela|Santa Ana de Coro]]".
In 1811, when [[Venezuela]] declared its independence from Spain, Coro remained faithful to the [[Spanish Crown]] and was merged with the [[Maracaibo Province (Venezuela)|Province of Maracaibo]]. In 1815, King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Fernando VII]] created the [[Coro Province|Province of Coro]]. In 1821, the province was liberated from Spain by [[Josefa Camejo]] during the [[Venezuelan War of Independence]]. The area then became a province of the department of [[Zulia]] of the Republic of [[Gran Colombia]]. In 1830, with the separation of Venezuela from [[Gran Colombia]], the Falcón area became a separate province of that nation.
[[File:Casco Central Santa Ana de Coro, estado Falcon, Venezuela.jpg|thumb|Historic center of Santa Ana de Coro, Falcon State, Venezuela]]
By 1856, the province contained the cantons of [[Coro, Venezuela|Coro]], San Luis, [[Casigua-El Cubo|Casigua]], Costa Arriba, [[Cumaribo|Cumarebo]] and the [[Paraguaná Peninsula]]. In 1859, after the [[Federal War]] began on 20 February in Coro, the area was declared the Independent State of Coro. In 1864, it became a federal state, part of the [[United States of Venezuela]].

=== Falcón State ===
In 1872 the province was renamed Falcón State, in honor of the [[Federal War]] leader [[Juan Crisóstomo Falcón]]. In 1879, along with [[Lara (state)|Lara]] and [[Yaracuy]], minus the Department of [[Nirgua]], it became part of the Western Northern State. Between 1881 and 1890 is formed, with Zulia, the state of Falcón-Zulia.

In 1891 Falcón was reestablished as a separate state. In 1899 its name changed, and for a short period of time, it retook its historical denomination of Estado Coro; returning in 1901 to tFalcón .

In 1899, the territory comprising the towns of [[Tucacas]] and [[Chichiriviche]], was annexed by Falcón. [[Lara (state)|Lara State]] received the municipality of [[Urdaneta Municipality, Lara|Urdaneta]].

Coro, the capital, founded with the name of Santa Ana de Coro, was declared National Monument in 1950, and [[UNESCO]] has named it Cultural Patrimony of the Humanity in 1993.

==Geography==
Falcón State is located in the north of the Corian System. To the south, Falcón contains medium-altitude mountain ranges configured from east to west, which in the eastern part of the state reach the [[Caribbean Sea]], forming maritime valleys.

West from the city of Coro, a [[coastal plain]] runs parallel to the [[Gulf of Venezuela]]. To the north lies one of the most characteristic geographic features of the Venezuelan coast: the [[Paraguaná Peninsula|Paraguana Peninsula]], linked to the mainland by the [[isthmus]] of [[Médanos de Coro National Park]].
[[File:Medanos de Coro Falcon.jpg|thumb|Médanos de Coro National Park]]

===Climate===
A [[hot arid climate]] (''BWh'' according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]) of very low rainfall dominates the western coast and the [[Paraguaná Peninsula]]. [[Coro, Venezuela|Coro]] receives {{cvt|380|mm|in|0}} of rain per year, which frequently fails in dry years, with an average temperature of {{convert|28.4|°C|1}}, while in [[Punto Fijo]] there is just {{cvt|180|mm|in|0}} of annual rainfall with average temperatures of {{convert|27.6|°C|1}}.

The extremely dry, desert conditions, with rainfall of less than {{cvt|300|mm|in|0|disp=or}}, are recognized on the western coasts of Coro and above all on the [[isthmus]] of Los Médanos de Coro, with average annual temperatures of between {{convert|28|and|29|°C|1}}. In the eastern coastal sectors, rainfall increases from {{cvt|800|to|1200|mm|in|0}} per year, always with high temperatures. Somewhat more favourable, with temperatures between {{convert|25|and|27|°C|1}}, are the climatic conditions of the mountainous foothills, recognizing a sub-humid climate in the higher altitudes of the [[Sierra de San Luis|Sierras de San Luis]] and [[Churuguara]], with an annual rainfall of {{cvt|1300|mm|in|0|disp=or}} and average temperatures of {{convert|22|°C|1|disp=or}}. On 29 April 2015, Coro recorded a temperature of {{cvt|43.6|C|F}}, which is the highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Venezuela.<ref name=wu20151021>{{cite web |last1=Masters |first1=Jeff |url=https://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/sixteen-nationalterritorial-alltime-extreme-heat-records-set-in-2015.html |title=Sixteen National/Territorial All-Time Extreme Heat Records Set in 2015 |publisher=Wunderground |date=27 January 2016 |access-date=19 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204182639/https://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/sixteen-nationalterritorial-alltime-extreme-heat-records-set-in-2015.html |archive-date=4 February 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Soils===
On the coastline the soils are [[calcareous]], and between the Lara and Falcón mountains, they are [[clay]]. They vary in quality, but in general, the availability of land for traditional agriculture can be classified as low, with 89% of very low potential, 3% of low potential and 6% of moderate potential.

Only 2% of it is located in the southeast valleys and [[Alluvial plain|alluvial]] areas, basins with very high potential. The limitations of the arid and semi-arid soils come from [[salinity]], dryness caused by low rainfall, low concentration of organic matter and the influence of climatic agents such as wind.

===Relief===
The Corian System of Falcon State presents a diversity of landscapes ranging from coastal plains on its [[Caribbean]] side to mountain ranges formed by valleys and hills, in an area of transition between the two major mountain systems of the country. The [[Sierra de San Luis]] have the highest altitude of the entire system, but are of very modest height; the highest does not exceed 1600 meters ({{ILL|Cerro Galicia|es}}).

[[Cerro Santa Ana Natural Monument|Cerro Santa Ana]] is another natural landmark, located in the center of the [[Paraguaná Peninsula|Paraguaná peninsula]]. Unlike the rest of the peninsula, the characteristics of Santa Ana Hill are the contrast between its greenness and the [[xerophyte|xerophytic]] vegetation of the Paraguaná area. It has three peaks: the Santa Ana (the highest, that ascends to about 830 meters above sea level), the Buena Vista and Moruy.

===Hydrography===
[[File:Embalse de El Isiro visto desde la Chapa.JPG|thumb|Isiro Reservoir, Falcon State]]
The state's [[hydrography]] is very poor. All the rivers flow north, either into the [[Caribbean Sea]] or the [[Gulf of Venezuela]]. However, the main Venezuelan river of the [[Caribbean Basin|Caribbean basin]], the [[Tocuyo River|Tocuyo]], bathes a large area of the state before flowing into the Caribbean on the east coast of the state after travelling 423&nbsp;km. Another river worth mentioning that flows into the Caribbean is Rio Aroa, with a length of 130&nbsp;km. From the basin of the Gulf of Venezuela, the main ones are the Matícora (201&nbsp;km) and the Mitare with 120&nbsp;km.

* Main rivers: [[Tocuyo River|Tocuyo]], [[Aroa River (Venezuela)|Aroa]], Güigüe, [[Hueque River|Hueque]], Matícora, [[Mitare River|Mitare]], [[Pedregal River|Pedregal]], Remedios, Ricoa, San Luis.
* Lakes: under the San Luis mountain range in the Cueva del Toro, there is an underground lake, the largest known in Venezuela, called "Río Acarite".

===Flora and fauna===
The [[Caribbean]] marine life off the coast is very rich. There is a great diversity of [[algae]] on the rocky shores and on the reef bottoms. The rich fishing grounds have been known for centuries; among the species that are caught locally are various [[shrimp]], octopus, [[squid]], [[mackerel]], [[Haemulon plumierii|corocoro]], [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]], [[Trachurus|horse mackerel]], [[Lebranche mullet|lebranche]] and [[Squalidae|dogfish]].

Other species in the area are endangered and highly protected, such as several types of [[sea turtle]] and the [[Critically Endangered|critically endangered]] [[Orinoco crocodile]]. The latter inhabits the coastal mangroves of [[Morrocoy National Park|Morrocoy]], Cuare Wildlife Refuge, and the [[isthmus]], along with the numerous species of [[Wader|wading]] and [[Seabird|seabirds]], such as [[shearwater]], [[heron]]s, [[scarlet ibis]], [[gannet]]s and the [[American flamingo|Caribbean flamingo]]. Among the many [[Invertebrate|invertebrates]], the Hueque [[scorpion]] (''[[Tityus falconensis''), named after the region and discovered in the caves of the [[Juan Crisóstomo Falcón National Park]], is found throughout Falcón; the ''[[Scolopendra gigantea]]'', which is the largest [[centipede]] in the world, and the vivid greenbottle-blue [[tarantula]] (''[[Greenbottle blue tarantula|Chromatopelma cyaneopubescens]]''), of [[Paraguaná Peninsula|Paraguaná]], are also native to the region.

In the [[cactus]] and spiny forests that encompass the lowlands, plants heavily armed with thorns predominate, such as {{lang|es|italic=yes|cují yaque}} (Falcón's emblematic tree), [[Genisteae|broom]], ''yabo'', {{lang|es|italic=yes|espinito}}, ''[[Opuntia]]'' (also known as ''tuna'', e.g. prickly-pear) and ''[[Pachycereus pringlei]]'' (or ''cardones''). Introduced [[Succulent plant|succulents]], such as ''[[Aloe vera]]'' and [[sisal]] plants, are scattered throughout the region. Fauna in this habitat includes bats, rabbits, foxes, rodents, [[iguana]]s and lizards; among the birds are the [[vermilion cardinal]] and the tropical mockingbird, also known as ''paraulata llanera'' or ''chuchube'' ([[Tropical mockingbird|''Mimus gilvus'']]).
[[File:Scarlet Ibis, Corocoro Colorado (Eudocimus ruber).jpg|thumb|Scarlet ibis in the Cuare Wildlife Refuge, Falcón State]]
On the upper slopes of the mountains, cloud forests dominate, and an enormous variety of ferns and other plants grow. In the [[limestone]] formations of the Sierra, you can find the ''[[Oilbird|guácharo]]'', or oilbirds, which live inside the caverns. Also found are the blacksmith's bellbird and the [[keel-billed toucan]], and numerous amphibians and reptiles, such as the nibbling turtle, [[Endemism|endemic]] to the mountains of the [[Coro region|Sistema Coriano]].

===Geology===
Early Cretaceous rocks cover the pre-existing sedimentary units in the south, in what is one of the thickest sections in South America. The rounded hills of the Cocodite table are supported by an ancient [[Igneous rock|igneous]]-metromorphic complex and a poorly-metamorphosed Jurassic succession.

To the east of Vela de Coro and Cumarebo, the foothills are supported by outcrops of the young Tertiary, also present to the north of Urumaco, where the stones are rough and darkened by iron oxide; while the plains concentrated in the lower part of the rivers are alluvial.

The arid plain presents quaternary earthquakes, with elevations sustained by rocks from the upper tertiary.

==Politics and government==
As a federal state, it is autonomous and equal in political terms to the other members of the Federation. It organizes its administration and public powers through the Federal Constitution of Falcón State of 2004, issued by the Legislative Council.

===Executive power===
{{See also|List of governors of Falcón}}
It is composed of the Governor of the State of Falcón and a group of State Secretaries of his confidence appointed and removed by the regional government. The Governor is elected by the people through a direct and secret vote for a period of four years and with the possibility of immediate reelection for equal periods, being in charge of the state administration before the Legislative Council.

The first elected governor of Falcon was Aldo Cermeño of the Social Christian Party ([[Copei]]), who governed between 1989 and 1992. The current state governor is Victor Clark, of the ruling [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] (PSUV) party, elected for the 2017-2021 period.
{{See also|List of Venezuela state legislatures|List of Venezuela state constitutions|List of Venezuela governors}}

Like the other 23 federal entities of Venezuela, the State maintains its own police force, which is supported and complemented by the [[Venezuelan police|National Police]] and the [[Venezuelan National Guard]].

===Legislative power===

The state legislature is the responsibility of the Falcón State Legislative Council. It is a unicameral and autonomous body, elected by the people through direct and secret vote every four years, and maybe re-elected for two consecutive periods, under a system of proportional representation of the population of the state and its municipalities. It has 11 legislators, of whom 3 are list and 8 are nominal.{{clarify| possibly elected vs nominated? Requires research|date=April 2021}}

== Municipalities and municipal seats ==
Falcon State is subdivided into 25 municipalities (''municipios''), listed below with their administrative capitals, areas and populations.<ref>Instituto Nacional de Estadistica, Caracas.</ref>
