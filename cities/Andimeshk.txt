==History==

The name first appears in cuneiform tablets from Mesopotamia from the [[Ur III]] period (21st to 20th century BCE) in the form "Adamshakh", with a probable meaning "Crocodile (Town)". Later it was called "Andamaska" or "Andimaska", meaning "plenty of butter"; local villages like Gheel-AB and Lour and two fortresses were added to it.<ref name="iranicaonline.org">[[Iranica]][http://www.iranicaonline.org/pages/how-to-search-iranica]</ref> The city was en route to [[Ilam, Iran|Ilam]] and [[Anshan]] and subsequently to [[Lorestan]], which made it strategically important until the late [[Sassanid]] era.<ref name="iranicaonline.org"/>

In the Andimeshk region, an individual known as Saleh-Khan Mukri (a Kurd from Kermanshah and the ruler of Shushtar during the Qajar era) <ref>{{cite web | url=https://khoorna.com/156474/%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%B6%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%AA-%D9%86%D8%B5%D8%A8-%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%B3-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AF/ | title=در ضرورت نصب تندیس برادران اقبال در اندیمشک | date=24 September 2020 }}</ref> built several buildings, including a fortress, for his residence, which became known as Saleh Castle or Lor Castle, and during the reign of Reza Shah Pahlavi and the construction of the railway In Iran, Andimeshk railway station was built in the vicinity of Lor Castle, and Andimeshk gradually expanded with the start of construction around it.

At the same time, the American General Motors Company established a branch of its military automobile factory in this city. In the second Pahlavi period, with the arrival of numerous domestic and foreign companies, Andimeshk became an industrial city and thus hosted thousands of domestic and foreign doctors, engineers, employees and workers. It was during this period that Andimeshk traveled the path of expansion and progress

During the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] era, Andimeshk received a great deal of modern development projects because of its location and resources. These included a railway, the [[Dokoohe]] military depot and an aluminum factory-silo, as well as many other industrial developments. The city had been connected along the [[Trans-Iranian Railway]] in 1929. During World War II a pipeline was also laid from [[Abadan]], then the location of the world's largest refinery, to Andimeshk; from there the fuel was re-loaded onto trucks and transported to the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1955 the pipeline was extended from Andimeshk to [[Tehran]].<ref name="ReferenceA">[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]][http://www.iranicaonline.org/pages/how-to-search-iranica]</ref>

It is 127 metres high and has a reservoir capacity of 5.9 billion cubic meters. The Karkheh Dam is designed to irrigate 320,000 hectares of land, produce 520 MW of hydro-electricity and prevent downstream floods. In 1956, studies began on the Karkheh Dam by the American company Development and Resources Corporation, which was headed by David E. Lilienthal, the former chairman of the TVA. In 1990, the final studies were completed by Mahab Ghods Consulting Engineers. The engineering division of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) started construction on the Karkheh Dam in 1992 and the dam was complete in 2001. During construction, 120 contractual and over eight consultative companies worked on the dam. 5,000 workers constructed the dam and 40 died in the process.<ref>http://www.industcards.com/hydro-iran.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120908213617/http://www.industcards.com/hydro-iran.htm |date=2012-09-08 }} Hydroelectric Power Plants in Iran</ref>
