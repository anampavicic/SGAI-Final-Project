==Name==
In 1804, the settlement was named ''Hobart Town'' or ''Hobarton'' by the first Lt-governor [[David Collins (lieutenant governor)|David Collins]] after then [[British Secretary of State]] for war and the colonies [[Robert Hobart, 4th Earl of Buckinghamshire|Lord Hobart]] (a variant of Hubert, his name was pronounced with emphasis on the second syllable) at [[Sullivans Cove]] (named after the under-secretary). Earlier in 1793, [[Risdon Cove]] was named after the second officer on the ship ''Duke of Clarence'' by the captain [[John Hayes (explorer)|John Hayes]], and the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|river]] after the [[River Derwent, Cumbria]]<ref>{{cite news |last1=Raabus |first1=Carol |title=What's in a name?

Though the island is offshore, the language is related and in the same [[Eastern Tasmanian languages|family]] as the [[Southeastern Tasmanian language]] which the local [[Mouheneener|Muwinina]] people spoke. Another recorded name was an [[Paredarerme language|Oyster Bay]] word ''lebralawaggena'' ([[William Bedford (chaplain)|Bedford]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plomley |first1=N.J.B. |title=Tasmanian aboriginal place names |date=1992 |publisher=Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery |location=Launceston, Tas. |pages=98 |edition=Occasional paper no. 3 |url=https://www.qvmag.tas.gov.au/files/assets/qvmag/library/publications/occasional/tas-aborig-place-names.pdf |access-date=28 June 2024}}</ref>

A semi-permanent settlement at Little Sandy Bay was called ''[[Long Beach, Tasmania|kriwa]]'' beneath the hill of ''[[Mount Nelson, Tasmania|kriwalayti]]''. The dividing line of the region is the ''timtumili minanya'' (river), which winds its way down from the [[Lake St Clair (Tasmania)|centre]] of the island through the lands of the [[Aboriginal Tasmanians#Big River|Big River]] (Lemerina) people. On the eastern shore, the name for the [[Clarence Plains]] was known as ''naniyilipata'' by the Mumirimina, a group of the Oyster Bay (Poredareme) people. [[Tranmere, Tasmania|Droughty Point]] was known as ''trumanyapayna'' (kangaroo point) as it was a hunting ground, and [[South Arm, Tasmania|South Arm]] as ''mutatayna''. Later names by the [[Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre|TAC]] include ''piyura kitina'' (little [[Tasmanian nativehen|native hens]]) at [[Shag Bay|Risdon Cove]] and ''turikina truwala'' (mountain waterfall) on the Myrtle Gully Falls track.<ref>{{cite web |title=pulingina to lutruwita place names map |url=https://tacinc.com.au/pulingina-to-lutruwita-place-names-map/ |website=Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre |access-date=28 June 2024}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Hobart}}
The first European settlement began in 1803 as a military camp at [[Risdon Cove]] on the eastern shores of the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|River Derwent]], amid British concerns over the presence of [[Baudin expedition to Australia|French explorers]]. It was the site of the [[1804 Risdon Cove massacre]]. Later that year, along with the military, settlers and convicts from the abandoned [[Port Phillip]] settlement, the camp at Risdon Cove was moved by Captain David Collins to a better location at the present site of Hobart at [[Sullivans Cove]].

The area's [[Aboriginal Tasmanian|Indigenous inhabitants]] were members of the semi-nomadic ''Mouheneener'' tribe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/ha/So&Sessionals.htm |title=House of Assembly Standing Orders |website=Parliament of Tasmania |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930220233/http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/ha/So&Sessionals.htm |archive-date=30 September 2008 |quote=We acknowledge the traditional people of the land upon which we meet today, the [[Aboriginal Tasmanian|Mouheneener people]].}}</ref> Violent conflict with the European settlers, and the effects of diseases brought by them, dramatically reduced the Aboriginal population, which was rapidly replaced by free settlers and the [[convict]] population. In 1832, four years after [[Black War#Martial law, November 1828|martial law]] had been declared, 26 people, including [[Tongerlongeter]] (Tukalunginta) and [[Montpelliatta]] (Muntipiliyata) of the combined ''[[Aboriginal Tasmanians#Big River|Big River]]'' and ''[[Aboriginal Tasmanians#Oyster Bay (Paredarerme)|Oyster Bay]]'' nations, surrendered to [[G. A. Robinson]]'s "friendly mission" and were marched into Hobart to negotiate a truce with Governor [[George Arthur]]. They were forcibly exiled ten days later to [[Wybalenna Aboriginal Establishment|Flinders Island]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Reynolds |first1=Henry |last2=Clements |first2=Nicholas |title=Tongerlongeter |date=2021 |publisher=NewSouth |location=Sydney |isbn=9781742237770}}</ref>

By this stage however, Aboriginal people had been forcibly exiled from the area following the [[Black War]].]]
[[Charles Darwin]] visited Hobart Town in February 1836 as part of the [[HMS Beagle|''Beagle'']] expedition. He compares it to [[Sydney]] and compliments the "[[kunanyi#European history|noble forest]]".<ref>{{cite web |title=Charles Darwin in Hobart Town - February 1836 |url=https://www.utas.edu.au/library/exhibitions/darwin/plants.html |website=UTAS |publisher=University of Tasmania |access-date=21 June 2024}}</ref> He writes of Hobart and the Derwent estuary in ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'':<blockquote>"...The lower parts of the hills which skirt the bay are cleared; and the bright yellow fields of corn, and dark green ones of potatoes, appear very luxuriant... I was chiefly struck with the comparative fewness of the large houses, either built or building. Hobart Town, from the census of 1835, contained 13,826 inhabitants, and the whole of Tasmania 36,505."</blockquote>

The River Derwent was one of Australia's finest deepwater ports and was the centre of South Seas [[whaling]] and [[seal hunting|sealing]] trades. The settlement rapidly grew into a major port, with allied industries such as shipbuilding.

During the mid 20th century, the state and local governments invested in building Hobart's reputation as a tourist attraction—in 1956 the Lanherne Airport (now [[Hobart Airport]]) was opened. Australia's first legal casino, [[Wrest Point Hotel Casino]], opened in 1973.

==Geography==
===Topography===
{{Further|List of Hobart suburbs}}
[[File:LGA Tas SE Hobart.png|thumb|The City of Hobart (green) and Greater Hobart (teal). Greater Hobart covers {{Convert|1695.5|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, whereas the built-up urban area covers {{Convert|81|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.]]
Hobart is located on the estuary of the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|River Derwent]] in the state's south-east. It is built predominantly on Jurassic [[dolerite]] around the foothills interspersed with smaller areas of Triassic [[siltstone]] and Permian [[mudstone]], straddling the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|River Derwent]].

The Western Shore extends from the [[Derwent Valley, Tasmania|Derwent Valley]] in the northwest through the flatter areas around [[City of Glenorchy|Glenorchy]] (which rests on older Triassic sediment) bounded by peaks averaging around {{convert|1000|m|ft}} (including [[kunanyi / Mount Wellington]], Mt Hull, Mt Faulkner and [[Dromedary, Tasmania|Mt Dromedary]]). The hilly inner areas rest on the younger Jurassic dolerite deposits, before stretching into the lower areas such as the beaches of Sandy Bay in the south, while the [[Hobart City Centre|City]] and [[Kingston, Tasmania|Kingston]] are separated by [[Tolmans Hill, Tasmania|hills]] and [[Taroona]]'s [[Alum Cliffs]]. The Derwent estuary exits into Storm Bay wrapped by the [[South Arm Peninsula]], [[Iron Pot]] and [[Betsey Island]], with [[Turrakana|Turrakana / Tasman Peninsula]] and [[Bruny Island]] beyond.

The Eastern Shore also extends from the Derwent in a southeasterly direction hugging the [[Meehan Range]] (which hovers around {{convert|400|m|ft}} with distinctive summits such as Mt Direction and [[Honeywood, Tasmania|Gunners Quoin]] towards the irregular valleys of [[Brighton Council (Tasmania)|Brighton]]) before sprawling into flatter land in suburbs such as Bellerive. These flatter areas of the eastern shore rest on far younger Quaternary deposits. From there the city wraps around the estuary to peninsulas and extends across the hills in an easterly direction into the valley area of [[Rokeby, Tasmania|Rokeby]], before reaching into the tidal flatland area of [[Lauderdale, Tasmania|Lauderdale]] (between [[Ralphs Bay]] and [[Frederick Henry Bay]]).

Hobart has access to a number of beach areas including those in the Derwent estuary itself: [[Long Beach, Tasmania|Long Beach]], [[Nutgrove Beach, Tasmania|Nutgrove Beach]], [[Bellerive Beach, Tasmania|Bellerive Beach]], Cornelian Bay, Kingston, and Howrah Beaches, as well as many more in [[Frederick Henry Bay]] such as [[Seven Mile Beach, Tasmania|Seven Mile]], Roaches, Cremorne, Clifton and Goats Beaches.

===Ecology===
[[File:Richea scoparia (23098905232).jpg|thumb|''[[Richea scoparia]]'' flowering on kunanyi / Mount Wellington]]
Hobart is located on the edge of the [[Tasmanian South East]] and [[Tasmanian Southern Ranges]] [[IBRA]] bioregions as well as being surrounded by parts of the [[South-east Tasmania Important Bird Area]] (such as the [[Meehan Range|Meehan]] and [[Wellington Range]]s) which provide important habitat for [[List of birds of Tasmania|Tasmanian birds]]. The [[East Risdon State Reserve]] contains the wattles [[Acacia derwentiana|Derwent cascade]] and ''[[Acacia riceana]]'', as well as the rare or endangered [[Eucalyptus risdonii|Risdon peppermint]] and ''[[Eucalyptus morrisbyi]]''. Other local plant species like [[Eucalyptus cordata|heartleaf silver gum]] and the abundant [[Eucalyptus globulus subsp. globulus|blue gum]] are also planted horticulturally, while many exotic species were planted as a result of aesthetic preferences from British colonisation. [[Eucalyptus amygdalina|Black peppermint]], [[Eucalyptus tenuiramis|silver peppermint]], [[Acacia dealbata|blue wattle]], [[Acacia melanoxylon|blackwood]], [[Allocasuarina verticillata|drooping sheoak]] and [[Exocarpos cupressiformis|cherry ballart]] are another common woodland combination.

[[Threatened species]] of wildlife found in Hobart include the [[swift parrot]], [[grey goshawk]], [[Tasmanian masked owl]], [[eastern barred bandicoot]] and [[eastern quoll]]. These amount to 11 species of fauna, 10 of flora and 4 vegetation communities. 5 of the threatened species are [[endemic]] to Hobart.<ref>{{cite web |title=Threatened species |url=https://www.hobartcity.com.au/City-services/Environment/Threatened-species |website=City of Hobart |access-date=23 June 2024}}</ref> A common sight within the city are [[Tasmanian pademelon|pademelons]] and [[Notamacropus rufogriseus|wallabies]], and the [[Hobart Rivulet]] is home to [[platypuses]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Help protect our platypuses |url=https://www.hobartcity.com.au/City-services/Environment/Help-protect-our-platypuses |website=City of Hobart |access-date=23 June 2024}}</ref> Wildlife groups and road safety advocates have highlighted the role of slower speeds in reducing urban roadkill and traffic injuries.<ref>{{cite web |title=What can I do? |url=https://www.bonorong.com.au/what-can-i-do |website=Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary |access-date=4 July 2024}}</ref>

While parts of [[kunanyi|kunanyi / Mt Wellington]] have been cleared in the past (and species like [[celery top pine]] were allegedly present), stands of [[Tasmanian temperate forests|old-growth]] [[Eucalyptus viminalis|white gums]] accompanied by giant [[Eucalyptus obliqua|stringybarks]] (such as the [[Eucalyptus delegatensis|Octopus tree]])<ref>{{cite web |title=Octopus Tree |url=https://listthemountain.org/living-wonders/octopus-tree |website=List the Mountain |access-date=23 June 2024}}</ref> remain there. A rare patch of non-[[sclerophyll]] [[Tasmanian rainforest]] dominated by [[Nothofagus cunninghamii|myrtle beech]] and [[Atherosperma|blackheart sassafras]] is located near [[Collinsvale, Tasmania|Collinsvale]]. A famous tree within the [[Hobart City Centre|city of Hobart]] is the [[Anglesea Barracks]] blue gum which may have been a seedling before the [[History of Hobart|colonial era]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cutting |first1=Lucie |title=In a quirky artefact of past practice, this Anglesea Barracks blue gum was filled with concrete |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-07-09/blue-gum-at-anglesea-barracks-concrete-heart/102559148 |access-date=23 June 2024 |agency=ABC News |date=9 July 2023}}</ref>

===Climate===
[[File:Hobart-Winter wonderland (51 of 54) 2015.jpg|thumb|Snow in Hobart, 2015. While [[Rain and snow mixed|sleet]] is not rare in Hobart during the colder months, and many outer suburbs receive snow frequently, snow is rare in the inner suburbs.]]
Hobart has a mild temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''; [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Cflk'').<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tapper |first1=Andrew |last2=Tapper |first2=Nigel |title=The weather and climate of Australia and New Zealand |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Melbourne, Australia |isbn=0-19-553393-3 |edition=1st |editor=Gray, Kathleen |page=300}}</ref> The highest temperature recorded was {{convert|41.8|°C}} on [[Angry Summer|4 January 2013]] and the lowest was {{convert|−2.8|°C}} on 25 June 1972 and 11 July 1981.<ref name="BoM" /> Annually, Hobart receives only 40.8 clear days without rain. Compared to other major Australian cities, Hobart has the fewest daily average hours of sunshine, with only 5.9 hours per day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/ |title=Australia's official weather forecasts & weather radar |website=Bureau of Meteorology |access-date=1 March 2006 |archive-date=12 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912140134/http://www.bom.gov.au/ |url-status=live }}</ref> However, during the summer it has the most hours of daylight of any Australian city, with 15.3 hours on the summer solstice.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sunrisesunsetmap.com/ |title=Worldwide sunrise, sunset, moonrise and moonset times for 2018 & 2019 |website=sunrisesunsetmap.com |access-date=2020-01-31 |archive-date=31 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200131130323/https://sunrisesunsetmap.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref> By global standards, Hobart has cool summers and mild winters for its latitude, being heavily influenced by its seaside location. Nevertheless, the strong northerly winds from the Australian outback ensure that Hobart experiences temperatures above {{convert|35|C|F}} in most years.<ref name=ClimateDataOnline>{{cite web|url=https://reg.bom.gov.au/climate/data/|title=Climate Data Online - Map search|publisher=[[Bureau of Meteorology]]|access-date=24 January 2024}}</ref> Those temperatures are very warm compared to climates on higher latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere with similar summer averages. Light [[frost|air frost]] occasionally happens, albeit not every year.<ref name=ClimateDataOnline/>

Although Hobart itself rarely receives [[snow in Australia|snow]] during the winter due to the [[southeast Australian foehn|foehn effect]] created by the [[Central Highlands (Tasmania)|Central Highlands]] (the city's geographic position causes a [[rain shadow]]), the adjacent [[Mount Wellington (Tasmania)|kunanyi / Mount Wellington]] is frequently seen with a snowcap throughout the year. During the 20th century, the city itself has received snowfalls at sea level on average only once every 5 years; however, outer suburbs lying higher on the slopes of Mount Wellington receive snow more often, owing to the more exposed position coupled with them resting at higher altitude. These snow-bearing winds often carry on through Tasmania and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] to the [[Snowy Mountains]] in Victoria and southern New South Wales. Nevertheless, [[Rain and snow mixed|sleet]] can occur in Hobart during the peak Tasmanian snow season (typically defined as being between May to September, with the most snowfalls in July and August).

Average sea temperatures range from {{convert|12.5|°C}} in September to {{convert|16.5|°C}} in February.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.seatemperature.org/australia-pacific/australia/hobart.htm |title=Hobart Water Temperatures |website=World Sea Temperatures |access-date=1 June 2017 |archive-date=5 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705113055/https://www.seatemperature.org/australia-pacific/australia/hobart.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Hobart has a diverse array of natural areas, parks and gardens. It is most notably defined by its large areas of [[the bush|native bushland]] owing to its location. The most prominent of these is [[Wellington Park]] which encompasses the plateau of [[kunanyi|kunanyi / Mt Wellington]] itself as well as much of the surrounding alpine woodland and dense forests. This is taken advantage of with a large number of trails for walking, hiking and mountain biking activities all across the Hobart metropolitan area, some of which follow watercourses like the [[Hobart Rivulet|Hobart Linear Park]] ([[Cascade Brewery|Cascade Gardens]]), [[Hutchins School|Lambert Park]], [[New Town Rivulet]] ([[Lady Franklin Gallery|Ancanthe Park]]) and [[Tolosa Park]], or ridgelines to viewing points in places like the [[Mount Nelson, Tasmania#Truganini Conservation Area|Truganini Conservation Area]] and Bicentennial Park.<ref>{{cite web |title=Explore the Greater Hobart area |url=https://www.greaterhobarttrails.com.au/ |website=Greater Hobart Trails |access-date=24 June 2024}}</ref> The former Fern Tree Bower of ''[[Dicksonia antarctica]]'' can be visited on the Pipeline Track.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pipeline Track |url=https://www.hobartcity.com.au/Community/Parks-sportsgrounds-and-reserves/Tracks-and-trails/Riding/Pipeline-Track |website=City of Hobart |access-date=24 June 2024}}</ref>

The city also has many urban bushland areas, most prominent of which is the centrally-located [[Queens Domain]] which contains the [[Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens]] established in 1818 (which, though ringed by [[Limited-access road|expressways]], remain a highly popular destination with a variety of attractions), the [[Hobart Cenotaph]] (accessed via the Bridge of Remembrance<ref>{{cite web |title=BRIDGE OF REMEMBRANCE|url=https://www.architecture.com.au/awards/bridge-of-remembrance-peoples-choice-2020-tasmanian-architecture-awards |website=Australian Institute of Architects |access-date=25 June 2024}}</ref> and [[Hobart Regatta]] grounds which link to the [[South Line, Tasmania|Intercity Cycleway]]), the [[Railway Roundabout, Hobart|University Rose Gardens]], a number of sporting facilities (like the [[Domain Athletic Centre]] and [[Doone Kennedy Hobart Aquatic Centre]]), and formerly the [[Hobart Zoo]] (a role now taken up by [[Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary]] in [[Brighton, Tasmania|Brighton]]). Areas along the eastern shore also provide recreation, including many coastal walks to areas like [[Bellerive Beach, Tasmania|Kangaroo Bluff]] (one of many former [[Hobart coastal defences]] which are now parks) and the Kangaroo Bay Parkland<ref>{{cite web |title=Kangaroo Bay Parkland |url=https://playstreet.com.au/projects-all/kangaroo-bay-parklands/ |website=PLAYSTREET |access-date=25 June 2024}}</ref> (near [[Charles Hand]] Park and the [[Rosny Park]]lands) in [[Bellerive, Tasmania|Bellerive]], Anzac Park and Simmons Park in [[Lindisfarne, Tasmania|Lindisfarne]], Wentworth park at [[Howrah Beach]], as well as hills within the urban area such as [[Rose Bay, Tasmania|Gordons Hill]], [[Geilston Bay, Tasmania|Natone Hill]], [[Tranmere, Tasmania|Rokeby Hills]], [[Mornington, Tasmania|Waverly Flora Park]] and the panoramic lookout at [[Rosny, Tasmania|Rosny Hill]].

In the city, many urban parks and gardens have sprung up over the years, like [[St David's Park]], [[Franklin Square (Hobart)|Franklin Square]], the Parliament or [[Salamanca Place|Salamanca]] Gardens, Boat Park ([[Battery Point, Tasmania|Princes Park]]),<ref>{{cite web |title=Princes Park |url=https://www.hobartcity.com.au/Community/Parks-sportsgrounds-and-reserves/Find-a-park-or-reserve/Princes-Park |website=City of Hobart |access-date=27 June 2024}}</ref> [[Dynnyrne, Tasmania|Fitzroy Gardens]] and [[Holy Trinity Church, North Hobart|St Andrews Park]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Hobart: Parks and Gardens |url=http://www.ourtasmania.com.au/hobart//hobart-parks.html |website=Our Tasmania |access-date=24 June 2024}}</ref> along with newer pocket parks like the Garden of Memories on [[Elizabeth Street, Hobart|Elizabeth Street]]. Inner suburban parks like Wellesley Park in [[South Hobart, Tasmania|South Hobart]], the Train Park (Caldew Park)<ref>{{cite web |title=Caldew 'Train' Park |url=https://www.mamamag.com.au/2022/10/10/calder-train-park-west-hobart/ |website=MAMAMAG |access-date=25 June 2024}}</ref> in [[West Hobart, Tasmania|West Hobart]], and the [[Elizabeth College (Hobart)|Cultural Skatepark]] and Soundy Park in [[North Hobart, Tasmania|North Hobart]] are also popular. Parks continue to extend along the complex coastline of the estuary, from the birdwatching area of [[Granton, Tasmania|Goulds Lagoon]], [[Old Beach, Tasmania|Old Beach]]'s "[[Fairy door|little doors]]", the [[Claremont, Tasmania|Claremont]] Cenotaph by Windermere Beach, [[Moorilla Estate]] winery, [[Glenorchy Art and Sculpture Park]] (GASP) with the [[Montrose, Tasmania|Montrose]] Boardwalk, [[Derwent Park, Tasmania|Giblins Reserve]] and [[Cornelian Bay Cemetery|Cornelian Bay]] to the north, and the Battery Point Sculpture Trail, [[Errol Flynn]] Reserve, [[Long Beach, Tasmania|Long Beach Reserve]] by [[Nutgrove Beach]] and the Alexandra Battery, and [[Kingston Beach, Tasmania|Kingston]] Park to the south.

[[File:Waterfront warehouses Hobart.jpg|thumb|The Hunter Street Precinct is known for its Georgian era waterfront warehouses, since converted into restaurants, bars and galleries.]]
Hobart's architecture is stylistically eclectic and reflects various periods of Australian history. The city is known for its well-preserved [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and [[Victorian architecture|Victorian-era]] buildings, giving specific areas an "[[old world]]" feel.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Content-Area Vocabulary Strategies for Language Arts |year=2002 |publisher=Walch Publishing |page=39 |isbn=0-82514337-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://architecthobart.com.au/ |title=History Section |date=2017 |website=Hobart Architect Blog |access-date=21 October 2020 |archive-date=23 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201023035331/https://architecthobart.com.au/ |url-status=live }}</ref> For locals, this became a source of discomfiture about the city's convict past, but is now a draw card for tourists.<ref>Clark, J.

[[File:Cascades Female Factory-Yard 4.jpg|thumb|A yard and cottages within the [[Cascades Female Factory]], one of eleven UNESCO [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]]-listed [[Australian Convict Sites]]]]
The city centre contains many of the city's oldest buildings, including the [[Hope and Anchor Tavern]] (1807) and [[Ingle Hall]] (1811–14). The [[Cascade Brewery]] (1824), Australia's longest operating brewery, was built using convict labour, as was the [[Cascades Female Factory]] (1828), now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Other notable early buildings include: [[c:File:Thursday, October 26, 2017 - 26644747109.jpg|Hadley's Orient Hotel]] (1834), Australia's oldest continuously operating hotel; the [[Theatre Royal, Hobart|Theatre Royal]] (1837), Australia's oldest continually operating theatre; the [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek revival]] [[Lady Franklin Gallery]] (1843), Australia's first private museum; and the [[Hobart Synagogue]] (1845), which is Australia's [[Oldest synagogues in the world|oldest synagogue]] and a rare example of an [[Egyptian revival]] synagogue. [[Salamanca Place]] contains many Georgian era buildings, as well as [[Kelly's Steps]], which were built in 1839 to provide a short-cut to [[Battery Point]], a largely residential suburb known for its weatherboard cottages and multi-storey terraces.

Government architect [[John Lee Archer]] designed the [[Regency architecture|Regency]]-style [[Parliament House, Hobart|Customs House]] (1840), facing [[Sullivans Cove]] and now used as Parliament House. He also designed the [[Gothic revival]] Engineers Building (1847) later used as the [[Tasmanian Main Line Company]] headquarters. Nearby are more buildings in the same style, Australia's [[Christ College (University of Tasmania)|oldest tertiary institution]] was based in the former Hobart High School from 1848 (Domain House, now owned by UTAS),<ref>{{cite web |title=Domain House |url=https://www.utas.edu.au/infrastructure-services-development/building-works/projects/domain-house |website=UTAS |access-date=25 June 2024}}</ref> and the [[Government House, Hobart|Government House]] building was built in 1857 and is the [[Old Government House, Hobart|third iteration]]. [[Henry Hunter (architect)|Henry Hunter]] was an architect known for churches such as [[St Mary's Cathedral, Hobart|St Mary's Cathedral]] (1898), but he also designed [[Hobart Town Hall]] (1866), located on the site of the old Government House.

The [[TMAG]] building, built in 1902 as a new [[Second Empire style]] Customs House, is situated on [[Constitution Dock]] and incorporates the Bond (1824) and [[c:File:Commissariat Store Hobart 20171119-025.jpg|Commisariat Store buildings]] (1810), the latter of which contributed to Hobart's early street layout when the [[Hobart Rivulet]] passed beside it. Away from the mouth of the rivulet was Hunter Island and after 1820 was also used for extensive warehousing.

Hobart is home to many historic churches. The Scots Church (formerly known as St Andrew's) was built in [[Bathurst Street, Hobart|Bathurst Street]] from 1834 to 1836, and a small sandstone building within the churchyard was used as the city's first Presbyterian Church. [[St John's Anglican Church, New Town|St John's]] in [[St Johns Park, Tasmania|New Town]], featuring a clocktower and turrets, sat in the middle of the Queens Orphanage complex (now near the [[Hobart City High School]]) from 1835.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Grant |first1=Duncan |title=No. 864 - New Town - St John's Anglican Church and the 'Queen's Orphan School' |url=https://www.churchesoftasmania.com/2021/01/no-864-new-town-st-johns-anglican.html |website=Churches of Tasmania |access-date=27 June 2024}}</ref> The Greek revival [[St George's Anglican Church, Battery Point|St George's Anglican Church]] in Battery Point was completed in 1838, and a classical tower designed by [[James Blackburn (architect)|James Blackburn]] (who also designed the [[Holy Trinity Church, Hobart|Holy Trinity Church]]) was added in 1847. St Joseph's was built in 1840 and the [[Davey Street Congregational Church]] in 1857. [[St David's Cathedral, Hobart|St David's Cathedral]], Hobart's first, was consecrated in 1874. The grand [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne style]] [[Mount Saint Canice]] (1893) sits above Sandy Bay.

The [[Edwardian Baroque]] [[General Post Office, Hobart|GPO]] was built in 1905, and the [[Hobart City Hall]] was built in 1915 in a [[Federation architecture|Federation warehouse style]] on the former city marketplace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ritchie |first1=Geoff |title=City Hall, Hobart |url=http://ontheconvicttrail.blogspot.com/2013/04/city-hall-hobart.html |website=On the Convict Trail |access-date=21 June 2024}}</ref> The [[North Hobart Post Office]] (1913) of a [[John Smith Murdoch]] design is in a colourful [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian style]]. Hobart is also home to a number of [[List of Art Deco buildings in Tasmania|Art Deco]] landmarks, including the [[T & G Mutual Life Assurance Society|T&G]] building (1938) on [[Murray Street, Hobart|Murray Street]], the Old [[The Mercury (Hobart)|Mercury]] Building on [[Macquarie Street, Hobart|Macquarie Street]] (1938), the former [[Hydro Tasmania]] (1938) and the [[Colonial Mutual|Colonial Mutual Life]] buildings (1936) on [[Elizabeth Street, Hobart|Elizabeth Street]]. The 1939 [[Streamline Moderne]] Riviera Hotel is joined by what remains the tallest building in Tasmania, the [[Wrest Point Casino]] (1973) designed by [[Roy Grounds]] in [[Moderne architecture|Moderne]]. Several of the [[List of tallest buildings in Hobart|tallest buildings in Hobart]] were built in this era, such as the [[International Style]] [[MLC Limited|MLC]] building (1958–77), the Empress Towers (1967), the [[Brutalist]] [[NAB House]] (1968) and former [[Reserve Bank of Australia|Reserve Bank]] Building (1977), and the brown-coloured [[Modern architecture#Asia and Australia|Modernist]] Marine Board Building (1972) and Jaffa Building (1978). [[Esmond Dorney|Dorney House]] (1978) at the former [[Mount Nelson, Tasmania|Fort Nelson]] is an example of residential modernism.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dorney House |url=https://www.hobartcity.com.au/City-services/Venues-banners-and-signage/Halls-and-venues/Dorney-House |website=City of Hobart |access-date=21 June 2024}}</ref>

The postmodern [[Hotel Grand Chancellor, Hobart|Hotel Grand Chancellor]] was built in 1987 in what was the Wapping neighbourhood, which now features many examples of [[contemporary architecture]], such as the 2001 Federation Concert Hall and [[The Hedberg]], designed in 2013 around [[Conceptual architecture|Conceptualism]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Hedberg |url=https://www.liminalstudio.com.au/creative-industries-performing-arts/ |website=Liminal Studio |access-date=21 June 2024}}</ref> The distinctive shapes of the 2020 K-Block redevelopment of the [[Royal Hobart Hospital]] was based on the street grid and convict-made [[Rajah Quilt]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Stage 1 K-Block |url=https://www.rhhredevelopment.tas.gov.au/about_k-block |website=RHH Redevelopment |access-date=22 June 2024}}</ref> Nearby is the [[Menzies Institute for Medical Research|Menzies Institute]] and [[College of Health and Medicine (University of Tasmania)|UTAS]] Medical Science Precinct, which features two 2009 examples of [[experimental architecture|avant-garde]] styles inspired by land-water interplay.<ref>{{cite web |title=Menzies Research Institute and Medical Science |url=https://www.lyonsarch.com.au/project/menzies-research-institute-and-medical-science/ |website=Lyons |access-date=21 June 2024}}</ref> On Castray Esplanade, the Salamanca Wharf Hotel was built in 2013 and combines Antarctic colours with the surrounding former-ordnance warehouses.<ref>{{cite news |title=SALAMANCA WHARF HOTEL OPENS IN HOBART |url=https://tasmaniantimes.com/2013/01/salamanca-wharf-hotel-opens-in-hobart/ |access-date=27 June 2024 |agency=Tasmanian Times |date=21 January 2013}}</ref> The [[Myer]] Centre [[Icon Complex]] was completed in 2020 as a replacement for the 1908 [[Liverpool Street, Hobart|Liverpool Street]] building which burnt down in 2007, while retaining the façade on Murray Street.

===Housing===
[[File:2021 Warrane nipaluna.jpg|thumb|Post-war housing is common throughout the city]]
Hobart as a city has delivered its housing by various means and forms. For its early history, housing was small-scale but clustered in very small areas (the highest concentration and diversity of Hobart's heritage remains around the constantly-evolving city centre).<ref name="Sprent">{{cite journal |last1=Solomon |first1=RJ |title=SPRENT'S HOBART, circa 1845 |journal=Papers and Proceedings of the Royal Society of Tasmania |date=1967 |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=20 |url=https://eprints.utas.edu.au/14255/1/1967_Solomon_Sprents'_Hobart.pdf |access-date=4 July 2024}}</ref> With the development of streets and [[Transport in Hobart|public transport]], such as a [[Rail transport in Tasmania|railway]] in 1876 and Australia's first [[Trams in Hobart|fully-electric tram network]] in 1893, further [[Transit metropolis|growth of the urban area]] was enabled. [[Streetcar suburb|Inner suburbs]] from this era typically have orderly streets (around planned subdivisions of former agriculture grants, often  inspired by the [[City Beautiful movement]]) with shopfronts (the [[Hill Street Grocer]] franchise derives from the commercial legacy of a former tramway) and narrow lanes lined with timber and brick cottages, [[townhouses]] and small apartment buildings.

[[Public housing in Australia|Social housing]] was usually organised by private societies and entities as outreach to those in need until crises brought greater attention from government authorities, such as the Homes Act (1919) and Housing Agreement (1945). The Housing Department focused mainly on mixing these with broad-acre suburban estates, which were sometimes expensive to service with adequate infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web |title=Housing (Public) |url=https://www.utas.edu.au/library/companion_to_tasmanian_history/H/Housing%20Public.htm |website=the companion to Tasmanian History |publisher=UTAS |access-date=22 June 2024}}</ref> Architects such as [[Margaret Findlay]] were employed by the public works department.

==Culture==
Since the 2000s, Hobart has gained a reputation as a "cool" and creative cultural capital<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mocatta |first1=Gabi |title=Hip Hobart |url=https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20130503-hip-hobart |access-date=23 June 2024 |agency=BBC News |date=10 May 2013}}</ref> with increasing numbers of tourists drawn to its unconventional or quirky events and art projects, many spurred by the [[Museum of Old and New Art]] (MONA). The term "MONA effect" refers to the museum's significant impact on the local economy and Tasmanian tourism.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Salmon |first1=Gregor |title=Capital gains: How MONA got Hobart humming |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-13/mona-got-hobart-humming/7081376 |access-date=23 June 2024 |agency=ABC News |date=13 January 2016}}</ref>

The city's nightlife is primarily concentrated in [[Salamanca Place]], North Hobart, the waterfront area, [[Elizabeth Street, Hobart|Elizabeth Street]] (which includes the pedestrianised [[Elizabeth Street Mall]]) and Sandy Bay. These areas are home to popular dining strips, pubs, bars and nightclubs.

===Theatre and entertainment===
[[File:Theatre Royal Campbell Street Hobart Tasmania Australia.jpg|thumb|right|Established in 1837, [[Theatre Royal, Hobart|Theatre Royal]] is Australia's oldest continually operating theatre.]]
The city centre is home to [[List of theatres in Hobart|several theatres]], including live theatre venues, picture palaces, and a multiplex operated by [[Village Cinemas]].

The [[Theatre Royal, Hobart|Theatre Royal]], established in 1837, is Australia's oldest continually operating theatre, designed by colonial architect [[John Lee Archer]].<ref>{{cite news |last=McIntyre |first=Paul |title=The Theatre Royal celebrates 175 years |url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/photos/2009/11/03/2731770.htm |access-date=24 May 2013 |date=3 November 2009 |website=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |archive-date=16 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150116112220/http://www.abc.net.au/local/photos/2009/11/03/2731770.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Another historic theatre is the Playhouse Theatre. Built in the 1860s, it was originally a chapel designed by [[Henry Bastow]]. Today, it is owned by the Hobart Repertory Theatre Society.

Hobart's largest arthouse cinema, the [[State Cinema, North Hobart|State Cinema]] in [[North Hobart]], was established as the North Hobart Picture Palace in 1913. It was acquired by the [[Reading Cinemas]] chain in 2019.<ref>{{cite news |first=Lucy |last=Shannon |title=Hobart's State Cinema, once saved by Gough Whitlam, enters new era after sale to Reading |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-20/hobart-state-cinema-sold-to-us-chain-reading/11721212 |publisher=abc.net.au |date=20 November 2019 |access-date=26 April 2022}}</ref> Located in [[New Town, Tasmania|New Town]], the Rewind Cinema, formerly the Hidden Theatre, is housed in a 19th-century convict-built structure.<ref>{{cite web | title=About | website=Rewind Cinema | url=https://www.rewindcinema.net/about | access-date=20 February 2024}}</ref>

===Galleries and museums===
[[File:NZ7 2764 Hobart (47021917141).jpg|thumb|[[Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery]]]]
Australia's first privately funded museum, the [[Lady Franklin Gallery]], was established in Acanthe Park by [[Lady Jane Franklin]] in 1843 and is now run by [[The Art Society of Tasmania]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the Lady Franklin Gallery |url=https://artstas.com.au/content.aspx?page_id=22&club_id=167994&module_id=410619 |website=The Art Society of Tasmania |access-date=1 April 2022 |archive-date=1 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220401101334/https://artstas.com.au/content.aspx?page_id=22&club_id=167994&module_id=410619 |url-status=live }}</ref> Three years later, the [[Royal Society of Tasmania]] (the oldest [[Royal Society]] outside England) founded the [[Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery]] (TMAG). Its first permanent home opened in 1863 and the museum has gradually expanded to occupy several surrounding buildings, including the [[c:File:Commissariat Store Hobart 20171119-025.jpg|Commisariat Store]], built in 1810. The TMAG-run [[c:File:Narryna Heritage Museum in Hobart, Australia.jpg|Narryna]] was founded in 1955 as the Van Diemen's Land Memorial Folk Museum and is housed within an 1830s Georgian town house. [[Maritime Museum of Tasmania|Maritime Museum Tasmania]] is located near TMAG on the waterfront and has been in operation since 1974.

The [[Museum of Old and New Art]] (MONA) opened in 2011 to coincide with the third annual MONA FOMA festival. Located within the [[Moorilla Estate|Moorilla]] winery on the [[Berriedale, Tasmania|Berriedale peninsula]], the multi-storey MONA gallery houses the collection of [[David Walsh (art collector)|David Walsh]] and is the Southern Hemisphere's largest privately owned museum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mona.net.au/ |title=MONA MOFO program 2011 |website=MONA |access-date=20 December 2010 |archive-date=18 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201218104544/https://mona.net.au/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Literature===
The first book of general Australian literature was published in Hobart. Titled ''The Last and Worst of the Bushrangers of Van Diemen's Land'', it was printed by convict [[Andrew Bent]] and details the life and crimes [[Michael Howe (bushranger)|Michael Howe]], the [[bushranger]] and outlaw. In 1824, Bent, as proprietor of the ''[[Hobart Town Gazette]]'', established the first free press in Australia. The first Australian novel, ''[[Quintus Servinton]]'', was written in 1831 by convict [[Henry Savery]] and published in Hobart.<ref>{{cite web |title=Australia's First Novelist – The Book Show |website=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=29 November 2011 |access-date=3 March 2018 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/bookshow/australias-first-novelist/3699100 |archive-date=19 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219023845/http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/bookshow/australias-first-novelist/3699100 |url-status=live }}</ref> Written during his imprisonment, it is a semi-autobiographical work about the life of a convict in Van Diemen's Land. [[Mary Leman Grimstone]], whose book ''Woman's Love'' was written in Hobart between 1826 and 1829, holds the distinction of being the author of the first non-biographical Australian novel. It was printed in London in 1832.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/quintus-servinton |title=Defining Moments - 1831: Australia's first novelist, Henry Savery, publishes Quintus Servinton |date=2022-09-28 |access-date=2022-10-20 |website=[[National Museum Australia]] |archive-date=19 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221019231009/https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/quintus-servinton |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[State Library of Tasmania]] is located in the city centre and comprises the [[Allport Library and Museum of Fine Arts]], which houses an extensive collection of colonial works and artefacts. In 2023, Hobart became a UNESCO [[City of Literature]].<ref>{{cite web |title=How Hobart achieved the title of UNESCO City of Literature, and what it means for Tasmanian writers |website=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=7 November 2023 |access-date=19 August 2024 |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-07/how-hobart-became-a-city-of-literature/103069122 }}</ref>

[[File:ODEON - Night Mass.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Odeon Theatre, Hobart|Odeon Theatre]], a popular live music venue]]
The [[Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra]] is based at the [[Hotel Grand Chancellor, Hobart#Federation Concert Hall|Federation Concert Hall]] on the city's waterfront.

Major national and international music events are usually held at [[MyState Bank Arena]], or the Tasman Room at [[Wrest Point Hotel Casino]].

The city's music scene has given rise to internationally acclaimed acts working in a variety of genres, including [[Striborg]] and [[Psycroptic]] (metal), [[The Paradise Motel]] (chamber pop), [[Sea Scouts (band)|Sea Scouts]] (noise rock), and [[Monique Brumby]] (indie pop). Other Hobart musicians have co-founded successful mainland Australian bands, including singer-songwriters Sacha Lucashenko (of [[The Morning After Girls]]) and Michael Noga (of [[The Drones (Australian band)|The Drones]]), and multi-instrumentalist [[Monika Fikerle]] (of [[Love of Diagrams]]). Theremin player [[Miles Brown (musician)|Miles Brown]], blues guitarist [[Phil Manning (musician)|Phil Manning]] (of blues-rock band [[Chain (band)|Chain]]), and [[TikTok]] artist [[Kim Dracula]] all originated in Hobart. In addition, founding member of [[Violent Femmes]], [[Brian Ritchie]], now calls Hobart home, and curated the annual international arts festival [[MONA FOMA]]. [[Chloe Alison Escott]] is from Hobart, and founded [[The Native Cats]] with Julian Teakle.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hennessey |first1=Kate |title=A day out with The Native Cats in Hobart |url=https://www.nme.com/features/native-cats-hobart-tasmania-city-tour-3009829 |access-date=9 September 2024 |work=NME |date=4 August 2021}}</ref>

Hobart-based teams also play in the [[Southern Football League (Tasmania)|Southern Football League]]. Hobart has hosted [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) matches since 1991, and in 2023, Tasmania was awarded a conditional license to field the league's [[Tasmania Football Club|19th AFL team]], nicknamed the Tasmanian Devils. The conditional license is contingent on a 23,000 seat roofed stadium being built at Hobart's Macquarie Point. It is anticipated that the men's team will join the AFL by 2028.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Press |first=Australian Associated |date=2023-05-03 |title=Tasmania granted 19th AFL team licence with 2028 slated for men's start date |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/02/tasmania-granted-19th-afl-team-licence-after-club-presidents-unanimous-support |access-date=2024-03-21 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-03-18 |title=Celebration as new Tassie logo, jumper and colours revealed |url=https://www.afl.com.au/news/1086666/watch-live-tasmanias-afl-team-revealed |access-date=2024-03-21 |website=afl.com.au |language=en}}</ref>

Tasmania is not represented by teams in the [[National Rugby League]], nor the [[Super Rugby]] (rugby union), [[ANZ Championship]] (netball) and [[A-League]] (soccer) competitions. However, the [[Tasmania JackJumpers]] entered the [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]] in 2021. The [[Hobart Chargers]] also represent Hobart in the second-tier [[South East Australian Basketball League]].

Hobart is internationally famous among the yachting community as the finish of the [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]] which starts in Sydney on Boxing Day. The arrival of the yachts is celebrated as part of the [[Hobart Summer Festival]], a food and wine festival beginning just after Christmas and ending in mid-January.

The [[Tassie Tigers]] field men's and women's representative sides in [[Hockey One]], which replaced the [[Australian Hockey League]] in 2019. They play their home matches at the [[Tasmanian Hockey Centre]], which has also hosted international competition matches, such as the [[Men's FIH Pro League]].

The city co-hosted the basketball [[FIBA Oceania Championship 1975]], where the [[Australian national basketball team]] won the gold medal.

The GreenCard fare ticketing system is held by about 100 thousand customers.<ref>{{cite web |title=GreenCard |url=https://www.metrotas.com.au/fares/greencard/ |website=Metro Tasmania |access-date=25 June 2024}}</ref>

There are also a small number of private bus services, departing from Murray Street and the [[Brooke Street Pier]]. These include the airport [[SkyBus (airport bus)|SkyBus]], and charters and coaches by [[Tassielink Transit]] and [[Redline Coaches]] (now [[Kinetic Group|KINETIC]], including the O'Driscoll Coaches Derwent Valley Link).

Tasmania spends the least per capita on public transport in Australia,<ref name="mckellinstitute.org.au"/> which is partly responsible for a weekday usage decline of 80.8% between 1964 and 2021.<ref name="tasmaniantimes.com"/> However, the State Government has indicated a consolidation of routes into three main [[Bus rapid transit|BRT]] spokes.

===Road===
[[File:Connection to the east - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Tasman Bridge]]]]
Hobart's transport is centred around roads. The main arterial routes within the urban area are the [[Brooker Highway]] to [[Glenorchy, Tasmania|Glenorchy]] and the northern suburbs, the [[Tasman Bridge]] and [[Bowen Bridge]] across the river to [[Rosny, Tasmania|Rosny]] and the Eastern Shore. The East Derwent Highway to Lindisfarne, Geilston Bay, and Northwards to Brighton, the South Arm Highway leading to Howrah, Rokeby, Lauderdale and Opossum Bay and the [[Southern Outlet, Hobart|Southern Outlet]] south to [[Kingston, Tasmania|Kingston]] and the [[D'Entrecasteaux Channel]]. Leaving the city, motorists can travel the [[Lyell Highway]] to the [[West Coast, Tasmania|west coast]], [[Midland Highway (Tasmania)|Midland Highway]] to [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] and the north, [[Tasman Highway]] to the east coast, or the [[Huon Highway]] to the far south.

Many of these highways were built after Australia's first motor vehicle [[Hobart Area Transportation Study|transportation study]] by US consultants in the 1960s, with an apparent urgency to cater to growing road traffic volumes. However, most of the targets were not achieved in the years after 1985 despite the scale of these projects, with the large amount of public funds required curbing feasibility. Another side-effect of this transition in investment away from public transport is that Hobart has limited mode redundancy compared to larger Australian capitals and a higher proportion of vehicle traffic, meaning that individual incidents can shut the entire network down.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Podwinski |first1=Isabella |title=Avoiding another major Hobart traffic jam means building a new bridge, one expert says — but are we too car dependent? |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-01-17/tas-bridge-traffic-tasman-hobart-gridlock-truck/101863226 |access-date=26 June 2024 |agency=ABC News |date=17 January 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Stayner |first1=Guy |title=Fixing Hobart's traffic woes may come down to driving cultural change |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-22/hobart-traffic-roads-getting-worse/11115722 |access-date=26 June 2024 |agency=ABC News |date=22 May 2019}}</ref>

As part of the [[Southern Transport Investment Program]], Tasmania's largest transport project, the $786 million (as of 2023) [[Bridgewater Bridge (Tasmania)#Replacement bridge|New Bridgewater Bridge]], is expected to finish by 2025.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Bridgewater Bridge Project |url=https://bridgewaterbridge.tas.gov.au/home |website=Bridgewater Bridge |access-date=25 June 2024}}</ref> Unlike the Tasman Bridge, it will be accessible to pedestrians upon opening.

===Ferry===
{{main|Ferries in Hobart|List of Hobart ferries}}
[[File:MONA ROMA departs Port of Hobart.jpg|thumb|''Ena'' departing the Port of Hobart for MONA]]
There is a ferry service by Derwent Ferries which operates a single line (F2) between [[Brooke Street Pier]] and Bellerive Quay that operates six days a week.<ref>{{cite web |title=Welcome Aboard |url=https://derwentferries.com.au/ |website=Derwent Ferries |access-date=2 September 2021 |archive-date=2 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210902054752/https://derwentferries.com.au/ |url-status=live }}</ref> It was initiated as a trial in 2021 servicing the [[Hobart City Centre]] and [[Bellerive, Tasmania|Bellerive]] on the eastern shore, garnering 110 thousand passengers by the end of the year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Derwent River ferry trial |url=https://www.transport.tas.gov.au/public_transport/derwent_river_ferry_trial |website=Transport Services, Dept.

The ferry provides a convenient alternative to crossing the [[Tasman Bridge]] [[Traffic bottleneck|choke point]], with its purpose being to reduce [[traffic congestion|congestion]]. It is seen as a first step in diversifying Hobart's [[Intermodal passenger transport|transport options]] to reduce traffic problems by taking the number of cars off the road rather than [[Induced demand#In transportation systems|inducing more traffic]]. More ferry terminal sites were revealed in 2023 to Regatta Point, Wrest Point, [[MyState Bank Arena|Wilkinsons Point]], Howrah Point, Lindisfarne and [[Kingston Beach, Tasmania|Kingston Beach]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Balen |first1=Clancy |title=Hobart ferry master plan reveals six proposed sites for new terminals — including Kingston, Sandy Bay and Lindisfarne |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-14/tas-proposed-locations-for-hobart-ferry-terminals-released/103098518 |access-date=25 June 2024 |agency=ABC News |date=14 November 2023}}</ref>

There are also private tourist ferries like the Spirit of Hobart, and two MONA Roma catamarans which take 25 minutes to the [[Museum of Old and New Art]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Getting here |url=https://mona.net.au/visit/getting-here |website=MONA |access-date=25 June 2024}}</ref>

Ferry services from Hobart's Eastern Shore into the city were once a common form of public transportation, but with lack of government funding, as well as a lack of interest from the private sector, the commuter ferry service was closed for many decades – leaving Hobart's commuters relying solely on travel by automobiles and buses. There was however a water taxi service operating from the Eastern Shore into Hobart which provides an alternative to the [[Tasman Bridge]] ([[Kosciusko (ferry)|ferries]] were temporarily loaned from Sydney following the [[Tasman Bridge disaster]]). The [[MV Cartela]] was one of Australia's oldest still operating since 1912.

===Air===
[[File:Hobart International Airport, Tasmania.jpg|thumb|[[Hobart Airport]] terminal]]
Hobart is served by [[Hobart Airport]] with flights to/from Adelaide, Auckland, Brisbane, Canberra, Gold Coast, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney, and regional destinations including the Bass Strait islands. The smaller [[Cambridge Aerodrome]] mainly serves small charter airlines offering local tourist flights. In the past decade, Hobart International Airport received a huge upgrade, with the airport now being a first class airport facility.

In 2009, it was announced that Hobart Airport would receive more upgrades, including a first floor, aerobridges (currently, passengers must walk on the tarmac) and shopping facilities. Possible new international flights to Asia and New Zealand, and possible new domestic flights to Darwin and Cairns have been proposed. A second runway, possibly to be constructed in the next 15 years, would assist with growing passenger numbers to Hobart. Hobart Control Tower may be renovated and fitted with new radar equipment, and the airport's carpark may be extended further. Also, new facilities will be built just outside the airport. A new service station, hotel and day care centre have already been built and the road leading to the airport has been maintained and re-sealed. In 2016, work began on a 500-metre extension of the existing runway in addition to a $100&nbsp;million upgrade of the airport. The runway extension is expected to allow international flights to land and increase air-traffic with [[Antarctica]]. This upgrade was, in part, funded under a promise made during the [[2013 Australian federal election|2013 federal election]] by the Abbott government.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/airport-runway-extension-works-under-way/news-story/6c6c0bbbfa533ce4b487b32956d37600 |title=Airport works under way |first=Nick |last=Clark |date=September 9, 2016 |newspaper=The Mercury |access-date=2017-09-09 |archive-date=13 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913025841/http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/airport-runway-extension-works-under-way/news-story/6c6c0bbbfa533ce4b487b32956d37600 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Seaport===

{{Main|Port of Hobart}}
Hobart's main port is managed by [[TasPorts]] and has a variety of uses. In [[Sullivans Cove]], the two Princes Wharves are used for [[Antarctic gateway cities|Antarctic]] restocking operations, while there are many piers and pontoons for berthing sailing boats, fishing vessels and yachts (at [[Victoria Dock (Hobart)|Victoria]] and [[Constitution Dock]]s, especially following the [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race|Sydney to Hobart]]) and a seaplane.<ref>{{cite web |title=Flights |url=https://aboveandbeyond.flights/ |website=Above and Beyond |access-date=26 June 2024}}</ref> At Macquarie Point, the six Macquarie wharves are used for cruise ships (with a terminal onto Hunter Street by the port tower building) and defence vessels.<ref>{{cite news |title=Three Australian warships dock in Hobart |url=https://pulsetasmania.com.au/news/three-australian-warships-dock-in-hobart/ |access-date=26 June 2024 |agency=Pulse Tasmania |date=13 May 2023}}</ref> Previously, shipping and services to ferry people between Sydney and Hobart such as [[Tasmanian Steamers]] and the [[Australian National Line]], and shipbuilding occurred nearby.<ref>{{cite web |title=Shipbuilding |url=https://www.utas.edu.au/library/companion_to_tasmanian_history/S/Shipbuilding.htm |website=The Companion to Tasmanian History |publisher=UTAS |access-date=26 June 2024}}</ref>

===Rail===
{{See also|Riverline (Hobart)|Trams in Hobart|Tasman Limited}}
While freight rail no longer operates within Hobart (since 2014), [[TasRail]] still operates the [[Brighton Transport Hub]] which connects to the [[Main Line, Tasmania|main line]] to the north of Tasmania. Locomotives can be seen in [[Bridgewater, Tasmania|Bridgewater]] as they make their way from the [[Boyer Mill]] near [[New Norfolk]] on the operational part of the [[Derwent Valley Railway (Tasmania)|Derwent Valley railway]].

Like many large Australian cities, Hobart once operated high-quality passenger rail services. This included a tram network which was closed in the early 1960s. The tracks are still visible in the older streets of Hobart. It was replaced by a short-lived [[trolleybus]] network consisting of six routes which operated until 1968. Suburban passenger trains, run by the [[Tasmanian Government Railways]], were closed in 1974 and the intrastate passenger service, the [[Tasman Limited]], ceased running in 1978. The [[Tasmanian Transport Museum]] in [[Glenorchy, Tasmania|Glenorchy]] has a restored section of track for visitors.

There has been a push from public transport advocates and the two local councils<ref>{{cite news |title=Hobart mayor hints at light rail in exchange for Glenorchy council merger |url=https://pulsetasmania.com.au/news/hobart-mayor-hints-at-light-rail-in-exchange-for-glenorchy-council-merger/ |access-date=25 June 2024 |agency=Pulse Tasmania |date=18 November 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Hobart needs State Government investment in transport infrastructure |url=https://www.hobartcity.com.au/Council/News-publications-and-announcements/Media-centre/Hobart-needs-State-Government-investment-in-transport-infrastructure |access-date=26 June 2024 |agency=City of Hobart |date=6 March 2024}}</ref> to establish a [[light rail]] network, intended to be fast, efficient, and eco-friendly, along existing tracks on the [[South Line, Tasmania|Northern Suburbs Transit Corridor]] to solve the frequent jamming of traffic in Hobart CBD. This has grown amidst the need for higher-capacity mass transit and an alternative State Government [[Bus rapid transit|bus]] proposal.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Balen |first1=Clancy |title=Transport options thin on the ground around Hobart's proposed AFL stadium at Macquarie Point |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-04-29/hobart-public-transport-in-spotlight-amid-stadium-plans/102280738 |access-date=25 June 2024 |agency=ABC News |date=29 April 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Abandoned Hobart rail corridor to get passenger trains again under Greens' plan |url=https://pulsetasmania.com.au/news/abandoned-hobart-rail-corridor-to-get-passenger-trains-again-under-greens-plan/ |access-date=25 June 2024 |agency=Pulse Tasmania |date=10 March 2024}}</ref> The earlier [[Riverline (Hobart)|Riverline proposal]], which reached a business case (at $100 million, demonstrating benefits for socioeconomically disadvantaged areas of the city), was scrapped in the [[2014 Australian federal budget]].
