After the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of the Empire in the west]], which marked the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]], Rome slowly fell under the political control of the [[Papacy]], and in the 8th century, it became the capital of the [[Papal States]], which lasted until 1870. Beginning with the [[Renaissance]], almost all popes since [[Pope Nicholas V|Nicholas V]] (1447–1455) pursued a coherent architectural and urban programme over four hundred years, aimed at making the city the artistic and cultural centre of the world.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Giovannoni |first1=Gustavo |title=Topografia e urbanistica di Roma |date=1958 |publisher=Istituto di Studi Romani |location=Rome |pages=346–347 |language=it}}</ref> In this way, Rome first became one of the major centres of the [[Renaissance]]<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Rome, city, Italy |encyclopedia=Columbia Encyclopedia |edition=6th |year=2009 |url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=117042793 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324095132/http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=117042793 |archive-date=24 March 2010}}</ref> and then became the birthplace of both the [[Baroque]] style and [[Neoclassicism]]. Famous artists, painters, sculptors, and architects made Rome the centre of their activity, creating masterpieces throughout the city. In 1871, Rome became the capital of the [[Kingdom of Italy]], which, in 1946, became the Italian Republic.

==Name and symbol==
===Etymology===
According to the Ancient Romans' [[Founding of Rome|founding myth]],<ref name="livy1797">{{cite book |publisher=Printed for A.Strahan |last=Livy |others=George Baker (trans.) |title=The history of Rome |year=1797}}</ref> the name ''Roma'' came from the city's founder and first [[Rex (king)|king]], [[Romulus]].<ref name=britannica>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/509038/Romulus-and-Remus |title=Romulus and Remus |encyclopedia=Britannica |date=25 November 2014 |access-date=9 March 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317100831/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/509038/Romulus-and-Remus |archive-date=17 March 2015}}</ref>

However, it is possible that the name Romulus was actually derived from Rome itself.<ref>Cf. Jaan Puhvel: ''Comparative mythology.'' The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore and London 1989, p. 287.</ref> As early as the 4th century, there have been alternative theories proposed on the origin of the name ''Roma''. Several hypotheses have been advanced focusing on its linguistic roots which however remain uncertain:<ref>Claudio Rendina: ''Roma Ieri, Oggi, Domani''. Newton Compton, Roma, 2007, p. 17.</ref>
* From ''Rumon'' or ''Rumen'', archaic name of the [[Tiber]], which in turn is supposedly related to the Greek verb {{lang|el|ῥέω|italic=no}} ({{lang|el-latn|rhéō}}) 'to flow, stream' and the Latin verb {{lang|la|ruō}} 'to hurry, rush';{{efn|This hypothesis originates from the Roman Grammarian [[Maurus Servius Honoratus]]. However, the Greek verb descends from the [[Proto-Indo-European root]] [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/srew-|''*srew-'']] (compare Ancient Greek {{lang|grc-Grek|ῥεῦμα|italic=no}} ({{lang|grc-latn|rheûma}}) 'a stream, flow, current', the Thracian river name {{lang|grc-Grek|Στρυμών|italic=no}} ({{lang|grc-latn|Strumṓn}}) and Proto-Germanic ''*strauma-'' 'stream'; if it was related, however, the Latin river name would be expected to begin with **''Frum-'', like Latin ''[[wikt:frigeo|frīgeō]]'' 'to freeze' from the root ''*sreyHg-'') and the Latin verb from [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h₃rew-|''*h₃rew-'']].}}
* From the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] word {{lang|ett|𐌓𐌖𐌌𐌀|italic=no}} ({{lang|ett-latn|ruma}}), whose root is ''*rum-'' "teat", with possible reference either to the [[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|totem wolf that adopted and suckled]] the cognately named twins [[Romulus and Remus]], or to the shape of the [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] and [[Aventine Hill]]s;
* From the Greek word {{lang|el|ῥώμη|italic=no}} ({{lang|el-latn|rhṓmē}}), which means ''strength''.{{efn|This hypothesis originates from [[Plutarch]].}}

While there have been discoveries of archaeological evidence of human occupation of the Rome area from approximately 14,000 years ago, the dense layer of much younger debris obscures [[Palaeolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] sites.<ref name="Heiken, G. 2005" /> Evidence of stone tools, pottery, and stone weapons attest to about 10,000 years of human presence. Several excavations support the view that Rome grew from [[pastoralism|pastoral]] settlements on the [[Palatine Hill]] built above the area of the future [[Roman Forum]]. Between the end of the [[Bronze Age]] and the beginning of the [[Iron Age]], each hill between the sea and the Capitoline Hill was topped by a village (on the Capitoline, a village is attested since the end of the 14th century BC).<ref name=coa9>Coarelli (1984) p. 9</ref> However, none of them yet had an urban quality.<ref name=coa9 /> Nowadays, there is a wide consensus that the city developed gradually through the aggregation ("[[synoecism]]") of several villages around the largest one, placed above the Palatine.<ref name=coa9 /> This aggregation was facilitated by the increase of agricultural productivity above the [[Subsistence economy|subsistence level]], which also allowed the establishment of [[secondary sector|secondary]] and [[tertiary sector|tertiary activities]]. These, in turn, boosted the development of trade with the Greek colonies of southern Italy (mainly [[Ischia]] and [[Cumae]]).<ref name=coa9 /> These developments, which according to archaeological evidence took place during the mid-eighth century BC, can be considered as the "birth" of the city.<ref name=coa9 /> Despite recent excavations at the Palatine hill, the view that Rome was founded deliberately in the middle of the eighth century BC, as the legend of Romulus suggests, remains a fringe hypothesis.<ref name="foundation">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/12/science/12rome.html |title=More Clues in the Legend (or Is It Fact?) of Romulus |first=John Nobel |last=Wilford |date=12 June 2007 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=11 August 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417112437/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/12/science/12rome.html |archive-date=17 April 2009}}</ref>

====Legend of the founding of Rome====
{{Main|Romulus and Remus|Romulus}}
[[File:Kapitolinische Wölfin Museum Capitolini.jpg|thumb|''[[Capitoline Wolf]]'', a sculpture of the [[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|mythical she-wolf]] suckling the infant twins [[Romulus and Remus]]]]

Traditional stories handed down by the [[ancient Romans]] themselves explain the earliest [[History of Rome|history of their city]] in terms of [[legend]] and [[myth]]. The most familiar of these myths, and perhaps the most famous of all [[Roman mythology|Roman myths]], is the story of [[Romulus and Remus]], the twins who were suckled by a [[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|she-wolf]].<ref name="livy1797" /> They decided to build a city, but after an argument, [[Romulus]] killed his brother and the city took his name.

After the foundation by Romulus according to a legend,{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=73}} Rome was ruled for a period of 244 years by a [[monarchy|monarchical system]], initially with sovereigns of [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] and [[Sabines|Sabine]] origin, later by [[Etruscans|Etruscan]] kings. The tradition handed down seven kings: [[Romulus]], [[Numa Pompilius]], [[Tullus Hostilius]], [[Ancus Marcius]], [[Tarquinius Priscus]], [[Servius Tullius]] and [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=73}}

In 509 BC, the Romans expelled the last king from their city and established an [[Oligarchy|oligarchic]] [[republic]] led by two annually-elected [[Roman consul|consuls]]. Rome then began a period characterised by internal struggles between [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] (aristocrats) and [[Plebs|plebeians]] (small landowners), and by constant warfare against the populations of central Italy: Etruscans, Latins, [[Volsci]], [[Aequi]], and [[Marsi]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=77}} After becoming master of [[Latium]], Rome led several wars (against the [[Gauls]], [[Osci]]-[[Samnites]] and the Greek colony of [[Taranto]], allied with [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], king of [[Epirus]]) whose result was the conquest of the [[Italian peninsula]], from the central area up to [[Magna Graecia]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=79}}

The 3rd and 4th century&nbsp;BC saw the establishment of Roman hegemony over the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Balkans]] through the three [[Punic Wars]] (264–146&nbsp;BC) fought against [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] and the three [[Macedonian Wars]] (212–168&nbsp;BC) against [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | pp=81–83}} The first [[Roman province]]s were established at this time: [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily]], [[Sardinia and Corsica]], [[Hispania]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]] and [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | pp=81–85}}

From the beginning of the 2nd century&nbsp;BC, power was contested between two groups of aristocrats: the [[optimates]], representing the conservative part of the [[Roman senate|Senate]], and the [[populares]], which relied on the help of the [[plebs]] (urban lower class) to gain power. In the same period, the bankruptcy of the small farmers and the establishment of large slave estates caused large-scale migration to the city. The continuous warfare led to the establishment of a professional army, which turned out to be more loyal to its generals than to the republic. Because of this, in the late 2nd and early 1st century&nbsp;BC there were several conflicts both abroad and internally: after the failed attempt of social reform of the populares [[Tiberius Gracchus|Tiberius]] and [[Gaius Gracchus]],{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=89}} and the war against [[Jugurtha]],{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=89}} there was [[Sulla's civil war|a civil war]] from which the general [[Sulla]] emerged victorious.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=89}} A [[Third Servile War|major slave revolt]] under [[Spartacus]] followed,{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=91}} and then the establishment of the [[first Triumvirate]] with [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], [[Pompey]] and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=91}}

The conquest of [[Gaul]] made Caesar immensely powerful and popular, which led to a [[Caesar's Civil War|civil war]] against the Senate and Pompey. After his victory, Caesar established himself as [[Dictator perpetuo|dictator for life]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=91}} His assassination in 44&nbsp;BC led to a [[second Triumvirate]] among [[Octavian]] (Caesar's grandnephew and heir), [[Mark Antony]] and [[Lepidus]], and to a [[War of Actium|final civil war]] between Octavian and Antony.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=93}}

After the end of the [[Severan dynasty]] in AD&nbsp;235, the Empire entered into a 50-year period known as the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], during which numerous generals fought for power and the central authority in Rome weakened dramatically. Around the same time, the [[Plague of Cyprian]] ({{Circa}} 250–270) afflicted the Mediterranean.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Huebner |first=Sabine |author-link=Sabine R.

The [[Germanic tribes]] along the Rhine and north of the Balkans made serious uncoordinated incursions that were more like giant raiding parties rather than attempts to settle. The [[Sasanian Empire|Persian Empire]] invaded from the east several times during the 230s to 260s but were eventually defeated.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=101}} The civil wars ended in 285 with the final victory of [[Diocletian]], who undertook the restoration of the State. He ended the [[Principate]] and introduced a new authoritarian model known as the [[Dominate]], derived from his title of ''dominus'' ("lord"). His most marked feature was the unprecedented intervention of the State down to the city level: whereas the State had submitted a tax demand to a city and allowed it to allocate the charges, from his reign the State did this down to the village level. In a vain attempt to control inflation, he imposed [[price controls]] which did not last.

Diocletian divided the empire in 286, ruling over the eastern half from [[Nicomedia]], while his co-emperor [[Maximian]] ruled the western half from [[Mediolanum]] (when not on the move).{{sfn|Kinder|Hilgemann|1964|p=101}} The empire was further divided in 293, when Diocletian named two [[Caesar (title)|caesar]], one for each [[Augustus (title)|augustus]] (emperor). Diocletian tried to turn into a system of non-dynastic succession, similar to the Antonine dynasty. Upon abdication in 305, both caesars succeeded and they, in turn, appointed two colleagues for themselves.{{sfn|Kinder|Hilgemann|1964|p=101}} However, a [[Civil wars of the Tetrarchy|series of civil wars]] between rival claimants to power resulted in the unification of the empire under [[Constantine the Great]] in 324. Hereditary succession was restored, but the east–west division was maintained. Constantine undertook a major reform of the bureaucracy, not by changing the structure but by rationalising the competencies of the several ministries. The so-called [[Edict of Milan]] of 313, actually a fragment of a letter from his co-emperor [[Licinius]] to the governors of the eastern provinces, granted freedom of worship to everyone, including Christians, and ordered the restoration of confiscated church properties upon petition to the newly created vicars of dioceses. He funded the building of several churches and allowed clergy to act as arbitrators in civil suits (a measure that did not outlast him but which was restored in part much later). In 330, he transformed [[Byzantium]] into [[Constantinople]], which became his new capital. However, it was not officially anything more than an imperial residence like [[Milan]], [[Trier]] or [[Nicomedia]] until given a city prefect in 359 by [[Constantius II]].{{sfn|Kinder|Hilgemann|1964|p=103}}

Constantine, following Diocletian's reforms. regionalised the administration, which fundamentally changed the way it was governed by creating regional dioceses. The existence of regional fiscal units from 286 served as the model for this unprecedented innovation.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Zuckerman |first=Constantin |date=2002 |title=Sur la liste de Vérone et la province de Grande Arménie, la division de l'empire et la date de création des diocèses |url=https://www.academia.edu/2108633 |journal=Travaux et Mémoires}}</ref> The emperor quickened the process of removing military command from governors. Henceforth, civilian administration and military command would be separate. He gave governors more fiscal duties and placed them in charge of the army logistical support system as an attempt to control it by removing the support system from its control.

Christianity in the form of the Nicene Creed became the official religion of the empire in 380, via the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] issued in the name of three emperors – Gratian, Valentinian II, and [[Theodosius I]] – with Theodosius clearly the driving force behind it. He was the last emperor of a unified empire: after his death in 395, his young children, [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] and [[Arcadius]], inherited the [[Western Roman Empire|western]] and [[Eastern Roman Empire|eastern]] empires respectively. The seat of government in the Western Roman Empire was transferred to [[Ravenna]] in 408, but from 450 the emperors mostly resided in Rome.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gillett|first=Andrew|date=2001|title=Rome, Ravenna and the Last Western Emperors|url=https://www.academia.edu/18189525|journal=Papers of the British School at Rome|volume=69|pages=131–167|doi=10.1017/S0068246200001781|jstor=40311008|s2cid=129373675|issn=0068-2462}}</ref>

Rome, which had lost its central role in the administration of the empire, [[Sack of Rome (410)|was sacked in 410]] by the [[Visigoths]] led by [[Alaric I]],{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=115}} but very little physical damage was done, most of which was repaired. What could not be so easily replaced were portable items such as artwork in precious metals and items for domestic use (loot). The popes embellished the city with large basilicas, such as [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] (with the collaboration of the emperors). The population of the city had fallen from 800,000 to 450–500,000 by the time the city was sacked in 455 by [[Genseric]], king of the [[Vandals]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=117}} The weak emperors of the fifth century could not stop the decay, leading to the deposition of [[Romulus Augustus]], who resided on Ravenna, on 4 September 476. This marked the end of the [[Western Roman Empire]] and, for many historians, the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=103}}

The decline of the city's population was caused by the loss of grain shipments from North Africa, from 440 onward, and the unwillingness of the senatorial class to maintain donations to support a population that was too large for the resources available. Even so, strenuous efforts were made to maintain the monumental centre, the palatine, and the largest baths, which continued to function until the Gothic siege of 537. The large baths of Constantine on the Quirinale were even repaired in 443, and the extent of the damage exaggerated and dramatised.<ref>''Rome, An Urban History from Antiquity to the Present'', Rabun Taylor, Katherine W. Rinne and Spiro Kostof, 2016 pp.&nbsp;160–179</ref>

However, the city gave an appearance overall of shabbiness and decay because of the large abandoned areas due to population decline. The population declined to 500,000 by 452 and 100,000 by 500 AD (perhaps larger, though no certain figure can be known). After the Gothic siege of 537, the population dropped to 30,000 but had risen to 90,000 by the papacy of [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]].<ref>''Rome, Profile of a City: 321–1308'', [[Richard Krautheimer]], p.&nbsp;165</ref> The population decline coincided with the general collapse of urban life in the West in the fifth and sixth centuries, with few exceptions. Subsidized state grain distributions to the poorer members of society continued right through the sixth century and probably prevented the population from falling further.<ref>''Rome, Urban History'', pp.&nbsp;184–185</ref> The figure of 450,000–500,000 is based on the amount of pork, 3,629,000 lbs. distributed to poorer Romans during five winter months at the rate of five Roman lbs per person per month, enough for 145,000 persons or 1/4 or 1/3 of the total population.<ref>Novel 36, 2, Emperor Valeninian III</ref> Grain distribution to 80,000 ticket holders at the same time suggests 400,000 (Augustus set the number at 200,000 or one-fifth of the population).

The Bishop of Rome, called the [[Pope]], was important since the early days of Christianity because of the martyrdom of both the apostles [[Simon Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] there. The Bishops of Rome were also seen (and still are seen by Catholics) as the successors of Peter, who is considered the first Bishop of Rome. The city thus became of increasing importance as the centre of the [[Catholic Church]].

After the [[Lombard invasion of Italy#Invasion and conquest of the Italian peninsula|Lombard invasion of Italy]] (569–572), the city remained nominally Byzantine, but in reality, the popes pursued a policy of equilibrium between the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], the [[Franks]], and the [[Lombards]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=19}} In 729, the Lombard king [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]] donated the north Latium town of [[Sutri]] to the Church, starting its temporal power.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=19}} In 756, [[Pepin the Short]], after having defeated the Lombards, gave the Pope temporal jurisdiction over the Roman Duchy and the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]], thus creating the [[Papal States]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=19}} Since this period, three powers tried to rule the city: the pope, the nobility (together with the chiefs of militias, the judges, the Senate and the populace), and the Frankish king, as king of the Lombards, patricius, and Emperor.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=19}} These three parties (theocratic, republican, and imperial) were a characteristic of Roman life during the entire Middle Ages.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=19}} On Christmas night of 800, [[Charlemagne]] was crowned in Rome as [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] by [[Pope Leo III]]: on that occasion, the city hosted for the first time the two powers whose struggle for control was to be a constant of the Middle Ages.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=19}} This event marks the beginning of the [[Carolingian Empire]], the first phase of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

The driving force behind this renewal was the monk [[Ildebrando da Soana]], who once elected pope under the name of [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] became involved into the [[Investiture Controversy]] against Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=20}} Subsequently, Rome [[Sack of Rome (1084)|was sacked and burned]] by the [[Normans]] under [[Robert Guiscard]] who had entered the city in support of the Pope, then besieged in [[Castel Sant'Angelo]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=20}}

During this period, the city was autonomously ruled by a ''senatore'' or ''patrizio''. In the 12th century, this administration, like other European cities, evolved into the [[Medieval commune|commune]], a new form of social organisation controlled by the new wealthy classes.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=20}} Pope [[Lucius II]] fought against the Roman commune, and the struggle was continued by his successor [[Pope Eugenius III]]: by this stage, the commune, allied with the aristocracy, was supported by [[Arnaldo da Brescia]], a monk who was a religious and social reformer.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} After the pope's death, Arnaldo was taken prisoner by [[Adrianus IV]], which marked the end of the commune's autonomy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} Under [[Pope Innocent III]], whose reign marked the apogee of the papacy, the commune liquidated the senate, and replaced it with a ''Senatore'', who was subject to the pope.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}}

In this period, the papacy played a role of secular importance in [[Western Europe]], often acting as arbitrators between Christian [[monarch]]s and exercising additional political powers.<ref name="Faus">Faus, José Ignacio Gonzáles.

In 1266, [[Charles of Anjou]], who was heading south to fight the [[Hohenstaufen]] on behalf of the pope, was appointed Senator. Charles founded the [[Sapienza University of Rome|Sapienza]], the university of Rome.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} In that period the pope died, and the cardinals, summoned in [[Viterbo]], could not agree on his successor. This angered the people of the city, who then unroofed the building where they met and imprisoned them until they had nominated the new pope; this marked the birth of the [[conclave]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} In this period the city was also shattered by continuous fights between the aristocratic families: [[Annibaldi family|Annibaldi]], [[Caetani]], [[Colonna family|Colonna]], [[Orsini family|Orsini]], [[Conti di Segni|Conti]], nested in their fortresses built above ancient Roman edifices, fought each other to control the papacy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}}
[[File:Giorgio Vasar retour idéalisé de Grégoire XI à Rome.jpg|thumb|Pope [[Gregory XI]] returned to Rome in 1376 and ended the [[Avignon Papacy]].]]

[[Pope Boniface VIII]], born Caetani, was the last pope to fight for the church's [[universal domain]]; he proclaimed a crusade against the [[Colonna family]] and, in 1300, called for the first [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee of Christianity]], which brought millions of [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] to Rome.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} However, his hopes were crushed by the French king [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]], who took him prisoner and held him hostage for three days at [[Anagni]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} The Pope was able to return to Rome, but died a month later, it was said of shock and grief. Afterwards, a new pope faithful to the French was elected, and the papacy was [[Avignon papacy|briefly relocated]] to [[Avignon]] (1309–1377).{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} During this period Rome was neglected, until a plebeian man, [[Cola di Rienzo]], came to power.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} An idealist and a lover of ancient Rome, Cola dreamed about a rebirth of the Roman Empire: after assuming power with the title of ''[[Tribune|Tribuno]]'', his reforms were rejected by the populace.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} Forced to flee, Cola returned as part of the entourage of Cardinal [[Gil Álvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Albornoz]], who was charged with restoring the Church's power in Italy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} Back in power for a short time, Cola was soon lynched by the populace, and Albornoz took possession of the city. In 1377, Rome became the seat of the papacy again under [[Gregory XI]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} The return of the pope to Rome in that year unleashed the [[Western Schism]] (1377–1418), and for the next forty years, the city was affected by the divisions which rocked the Church.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}

===Early modern history===
{{Main|Roman Renaissance}}
[[File:Wolf-Dietrich-Klebeband Städtebilder G 123 III.jpg|thumb|Almost 500 years old, this map of Rome by [[Mario Cartaro]] (from 1575) shows the city's primary monuments.]]
[[File:0 Castel et pont Sant'Angelo (1).JPG|thumb|right|[[Castel Sant'Angelo]], or Hadrian's Mausoleum, is a Roman monument built in 134 AD, radically altered in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and crowned with 16th and 17th-century statues.]]
[[File:Fontana della Barcaccia restaurata, guardando verso Piazza Mignanelli.jpg|thumb|[[Fontana della Barcaccia]], created by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] in 1629]]
In 1418, the [[Council of Constance]] settled the [[Western Schism]], and a Roman pope, [[Martin V]], was elected.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} This brought to Rome a century of internal peace, which marked the beginning of the [[Renaissance]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} The ruling popes until the first half of the 16th century, from [[Nicholas V]], founder of the [[Vatican Library]], to [[Pius II]], humanist and literate, from [[Sixtus IV]], a warrior pope, to [[Alexander VI]], immoral and [[Nepotism|nepotist]], from [[Julius II]], soldier and patron, to [[Leo X]], who gave his name to this period ("the century of Leo X"), all devoted their energy to the greatness and the beauty of the Eternal City and to the patronage of the arts.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}

During those years, the centre of the [[Italian Renaissance]] moved to Rome from Florence. Majestic works, as the new [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel]] and ''[[Ponte Sisto]]'' (the first bridge to be built across the [[Tiber]] since antiquity, although on Roman foundations) were created. To accomplish that, the Popes engaged the best artists of the time, including [[Michelangelo]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], [[Raphael]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Luca Signorelli]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], and [[Cosimo Rosselli]].

The period was also infamous for papal corruption, with many Popes fathering children, and engaging in [[nepotism]] and [[simony]]. The corruption of the Popes and the huge expenses for their building projects led, in part, to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and, in turn, the [[Counter-Reformation]]. Under extravagant and rich popes, Rome was transformed into a centre of art, poetry, music, literature, education and culture. Rome became able to compete with other major European cities of the time in terms of wealth, grandeur, the arts, learning and architecture.

The Renaissance period changed the face of Rome dramatically, with works like the [[Pietà (Michelangelo)|Pietà]] by Michelangelo and the frescoes of the [[Borgia Apartments]]. Rome reached the highest point of splendour under [[Pope Julius II]] (1503–1513) and his successors [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]], both members of the [[House of Medici|Medici family]].

[[File:View of the Piazza Navona, Rome LACMA 49.17.3.jpg|thumb|''A View of the Piazza Navona, Rome'', by [[Hendrik Frans van Lint]], {{circa|1730}}]]

In this twenty-year period, Rome became one of the greatest centres of art in the world. The old St. Peter's Basilica built by Emperor [[Constantine the Great]]<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13369b.htm |first1=P.M. |last1=Baumgarten |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |title=Basilica of St. Peter |publisher=New Advent |date=1 February 1912 |access-date=3 February 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110133607/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13369b.htm |archive-date=10 January 2010}}</ref> (which by then was in a dilapidated state) was demolished and a new one begun. The city hosted artists like [[Ridolfo Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], who built the temple of [[San Pietro in Montorio]] and planned a great project to renovate the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]. Raphael, who in Rome became one of the most famous painters of Italy, created frescoes in the [[Villa Farnesina]], the [[Raphael Rooms|Raphael's Rooms]], plus many other famous paintings. Michelangelo started the decoration of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and executed the famous statue of the [[Moses]] for the tomb of Julius II.

Its economy was rich, with the presence of several Tuscan bankers, including [[Agostino Chigi]], who was a friend of Raphael and a patron of arts. Before his early death, Raphael also promoted for the first time the preservation of the ancient ruins. The [[War of the League of Cognac]] caused the first plunder of the city in more than five hundred years since [[Sack of Rome (1084)|the previous sack]]; in 1527, the [[Landsknecht]]s of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked the city]], bringing an abrupt end to the golden age of the Renaissance in Rome.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}

Beginning with the [[Council of Trent]] in 1545, the Church began the Counter-Reformation in response to the Reformation, a large-scale questioning of the Church's authority on spiritual matters and governmental affairs. This loss of confidence led to major shifts of power away from the Church.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} Under the popes from [[Pius IV]] to [[Sixtus V]], Rome became the centre of a reformed Catholicism and saw the building of new monuments which celebrated the papacy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=23}} The popes and cardinals of the 17th and early 18th centuries continued the movement by having the city's landscape enriched with baroque buildings.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=23}}

This was another nepotistic age; the new aristocratic families ([[Barberini family|Barberini]], [[Pamphili family|Pamphili]], [[Chigi family|Chigi]], [[Rospigliosi family|Rospigliosi]], [[Altieri family|Altieri]], [[Odescalchi family|Odescalchi]]) were protected by their respective popes, who built huge baroque buildings for their relatives.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=23}} During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], new ideas reached the Eternal City, where the papacy supported archaeological studies and improved the people's welfare.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} But not everything went well for the Church during the Counter-Reformation. There were setbacks in the attempts to assert the Church's power, a notable example being in 1773 when Pope Clement XIV was forced by secular powers to have the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|Jesuit order suppressed]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}

===Late modern and contemporary===
[[File:Breccia di Porta Pia Ademollo.jpg|thumb|[[Bersaglieri]] troops breaching the [[Aurelian Walls]] at [[Porta Pia]] during the ''[[Capture of Rome]]'' (1870), the final event of the [[Italian unification]]. Painting by [[Carlo Ademollo]].]]

The rule of the Popes was interrupted by the short-lived [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] (1798–1800), which was established under the influence of the [[French Revolution]]. The [[Papal States]] were restored in June 1800, but during [[Napoleon]]'s reign Rome was [[Rome (department)|annexed as a ''Département'']] of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]: first as ''Département du Tibre'' (1808–1810) and then as ''Département Rome'' (1810–1814). After the fall of Napoleon, the Papal States were reconstituted by a decision of the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814.

In 1849, [[Roman Republic (19th century)|a second Roman Republic]] was proclaimed during a year of [[revolutions in 1848]]. Two of the most influential figures of the [[Italian unification]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], fought for the short-lived republic.

Rome then became the focus of hopes of Italian reunification after the rest of Italy was united as the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861 with the temporary capital in [[Florence]]. That year Rome was declared the capital of Italy even though it was still under the Pope's control. During the 1860s, the last vestiges of the Papal States were under French protection thanks to the foreign policy of [[Napoleon III]]. French troops were stationed in the region under Papal control. In 1870 the French troops were withdrawn due to the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Italian troops were able to [[Capture of Rome|capture Rome]] entering the city through a breach near [[Porta Pia]]. [[Pope Pius IX]] declared himself a [[prisoner in the Vatican]]. In 1871 the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12134b.htm |date=1911 |last1=Ott |first1=M. |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |title=Pope Pius IX |publisher=New Advent |access-date=3 February 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308223209/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12134b.htm |archive-date=8 March 2017}}</ref> In 1870 the population of the city was 212,000, all of whom lived with the area circumscribed by the ancient city, and in 1920, the population was 660,000. A significant portion lived outside the walls in the north and across the Tiber in the Vatican area.

[[File:Bombardamento di Roma.gif|thumb|right|Bombardment of Rome by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] planes, 1943]]

Soon after World War I in late 1922 Rome witnessed the rise of [[Italian Fascism]] led by [[Benito Mussolini]], who led a [[March on Rome|march on the city]]. He did away with democracy by 1926, eventually declaring a new [[Imperial Italy (fascist)|Italian Empire]] and allying Italy with [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938. Mussolini demolished fairly large parts of the city centre in order to build wide avenues and squares which were supposed to celebrate the fascist regime and the resurgence and glorification of classical Rome.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cederna |first1=Antonio |title=Mussolini urbanista |date=1979 |publisher=Laterza |location=Bari |pages=passim |language=it}}</ref> The interwar period saw a rapid growth in the city's population which surpassed one million inhabitants soon after 1930. During World War II, due to the art treasuries and the presence of the Vatican, Rome largely escaped the tragic destiny of other European cities. However, on 19 July 1943, the [[Quartiere San Lorenzo|San Lorenzo district]] was [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|subject to Allied bombing raids]], resulting in about 3,000 fatalities and 11,000 injuries, of whom another 1,500 died.<ref>{{cite news|last=Baily|first=Virginia|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/25/liberation-of-rome-italian-imagination|title=How the Nazi occupation of Rome has gripped Italy's cultural imagination|work=The Guardian|date=25 July 2015|access-date=5 January 2022}}</ref> Mussolini [[Fall of the Fascist regime in Italy|was arrested on 25 July 1943]]. On the date of the [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italian Armistice]] 8 September 1943 the city was occupied by the Germans. Allied bombing raids continued throughout 1943 and extended into 1944. Rome was liberated on 4 June 1944.

Rome developed greatly after the war as part of the "[[Italian economic miracle]]" of post-war reconstruction and modernisation in the 1950s and early 1960s. During this period, the years of ''la dolce vita'' ("the sweet life"), Rome became a fashionable city, with popular classic films such as ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]'', ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'', ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' and ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' filmed in the city's iconic [[Cinecittà|Cinecittà Studios]]. The rising trend in population growth continued until the mid-1980s when the ''comune'' had more than 2.8 million residents. After this, the population declined slowly as people began to move to nearby suburbs.

==Geography==
===Location===
[[File:Rome,_Italy_ESA24383157.jpeg|thumb|Satellite image of Rome]]

Rome is in the [[Lazio]] region of [[central Italy]] on the [[Tiber]] ({{langx|it|Tevere}}) river. The original settlement developed on hills that faced onto a ford beside the [[Tiber Island]], the only natural ford of the river in this area. The Rome of the Kings was built on seven hills: the [[Aventine Hill]], the [[Caelian Hill]], the [[Capitoline Hill]], the [[Esquiline Hill]], the [[Palatine Hill]], the [[Quirinal Hill]], and the [[Viminal Hill]]. Modern Rome is also crossed by another river, the [[Aniene]], which flows into the Tiber north of the historic centre.

Although the city centre is about {{cvt|24|km|mi|0}} inland from the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], the city territory extends to the shore, where the south-western district of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]] is located. The altitude of the central part of Rome ranges from {{cvt|13|m|0}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] (at the base of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]) to {{cvt|139|m|0}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] (the peak of [[Monte Mario]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ravaglioli |first1=Armando |title=Roma anno 2750 ab Urbe condita |publisher=Tascabili Economici Newton |year=1997 |location=Rome |language=it |isbn=978-88-8183-670-3}}</ref> The ''Comune'' of Rome covers an overall area of about {{cvt|1285|km2|0}}, including many green areas.

===Parks and gardens===
{{Main|List of parks and gardens in Rome}}
[[File:Rome-VillaBorghese-TempleEsculape.jpg|thumb|The [[Temple of Aesculapius (Villa Borghese)|Temple of Aesculapius]], in the [[Villa Borghese gardens]]]]

Public parks and nature reserves cover a large area in Rome, and the city has one of the largest areas of green space among European capitals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.romaperkyoto.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=35&Itemid=52 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204030918/http://www.romaperkyoto.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=35&Itemid=52 |archive-date=4 February 2008 |title=Green Areas |publisher=RomaPerKyoto.org |access-date=9 November 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The most notable part of this green space is represented by the large number of villas and landscaped gardens created by the Italian aristocracy. While most of the parks surrounding the villas were destroyed during the building boom of the late 19th century, some of them remain. The most notable of these are the [[Villa Borghese gardens|Villa Borghese]], [[Villa Ada]], and [[Villa Doria Pamphili]]. Villa Doria Pamphili is west of the Gianicolo hill, comprising some {{cvt|1.8|km2|1|abbr=out|lk=out}}. The [[Villa Sciarra (Rome)|Villa Sciarra]] is on the hill, with playgrounds for children and shaded walking areas. In the nearby area of Trastevere, the [[Orto Botanico dell'Università di Roma "La Sapienza"|Orto Botanico]] (Botanical Garden) is a cool and shady green space. The old Roman hippodrome (Circus Maximus) is another large green space: it has few trees but is overlooked by the Palatine and the Rose Garden ('roseto comunale'). Nearby is the lush [[Villa Celimontana]], close to the gardens surrounding the Baths of Caracalla. The Villa Borghese garden is the best known large green space in Rome, with famous art galleries among its shaded walks. Overlooking [[Piazza del Popolo]] and the Spanish Steps are the gardens of [[Pincio]] and [[Villa Medici]]. There is also a notable pine wood at [[Castelfusano]], near Ostia. Rome also has a number of regional parks of much more recent origin, including the [[Pineto Regional Park]] and the Appian Way Regional Park. There are also nature reserves at Marcigliana and at Tenuta di Castelporziano.

The size of the city at the time of the Emperor [[Augustus]] is a matter of speculation, with estimates based on grain distribution, grain imports, aqueduct capacity, city limits, population density, census reports, and assumptions about the number of unreported women, children and slaves providing a very wide range. Glenn Storey estimates 450,000 people, Whitney Oates estimates 1.2 million, Neville Morely provides a rough estimate of 800,000 and excludes earlier suggestions of 2 million.<ref>N.Morley, ''Metropolis and Hinterland'' (Cambridge, 1996) 33–39</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Duiker |first1=William |last2=Spielvogel |first2=Jackson |title=World History |date=2001 |publisher=Wadsworth |isbn=978-0-534-57168-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/worldhistoryto1500duik/page/149 |url-access=registration |page=149 |edition=Third}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Storey |first=Glenn R. |year=1997 |title=The population of ancient Rome |journal=Antiquity |publisher=Cambridge University Press |volume=71 |issue=274 |pages=966–978 |doi=10.1017/s0003598x00085859 |issn=0003-598X|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Oates |first=Whitney J. |url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Journals/CP/29/2/Population_of_Rome*.html |title=The Population of Rome |journal=Classical Philology |publisher=University of Chicago Press |volume=29 |issue=2 |year=1934 |issn=0009-837X |doi=10.1086/361701 |pages=101–116 |s2cid=154126945 |access-date=20 February 2021 |archive-date=29 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210529132834/https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Journals/CP/29/2/Population_of_Rome%2A.html |url-status=live}}</ref> Estimates of the city's population towards and after the end of the Roman empire also vary. A.H.M. Jones estimated the population at 650,000 in the mid-fifth century. The damage caused by the sackings may have been overestimated. The population had already started to decline from the late fourth century onward, although around the middle of the fifth century it seems that Rome continued to be the most populous city of the two parts of the Empire.<ref>Arnold HM Jones The Decline of the Ancient World, Lonmans, Green and Co. Ltd, London 1966</ref> According to Krautheimer it was still close to 800,000 in 400 AD; had declined to 500,000 by 452, and dwindled to perhaps 100,000 in 500 AD. After the Gothic Wars, 535–552, the population may have dwindled temporarily to 30,000. During the pontificate of [[Pope Gregory I]] (590–604), it may have reached 90,000, augmented by refugees.<ref>Richard Krautheimer, Rome, Profile of a City, 312–1308, 2000 p. 65 {{ISBN|0-691-04961-0}}</ref> Lancon estimates 500,000 based on the number of 'incisi' enrolled as eligible to receive bread, oil and wine rations; the number fell to 120,000 in the [[reform of 419]].<ref>Bernard Lancon, Rome in Late Antiquity, 2001 p. 14 {{ISBN|0-415-92976-8}}</ref> Neil Christie, citing free rations for the poorest, estimated 500,000 in the mid-fifth century and still a quarter of a million at the end of the century.<ref>Neil Christie, From Constantine to Charlemagne, An Archaeology of Italy 300–800 A.D. 2006 p. 61, {{ISBN|978-1-85928-421-6}}</ref> Novel 36 of Emperor [[Valentinian III]] records 3.629 million pounds of pork to be distributed to the needy at 5 lbs. per month for the five winter months, sufficient for 145,000 recipients. This has been used to suggest a population of just under 500,000. Supplies of grain remained steady until the seizure of the remaining provinces of North Africa in 439 by the [[Vandals]], and may have continued to some degree afterwards for a while. The city's population declined to less than 50,000 people in the [[Early Middle Ages]] from 700 AD onward. It continued to stagnate or shrink until the [[Renaissance]].<ref>P. Llewellyn, ''Rome in the Dark Ages'' (London 1993), p. 97.</ref>

When the [[Kingdom of Italy]] annexed Rome in 1870, the city had a population of about 225,000. Less than half the city within the walls was built up in 1881 when the population recorded was 275,000. This increased to 600,000 by the eve of World War I. The [[Fascism|Fascist]] regime of Mussolini tried to block an excessive demographic rise of the city but failed to prevent it from reaching one million people by the early 1930s.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}{{clarify|why?|date=March 2014}} Population growth continued after the Second World War, helped by a post-war economic boom. A construction boom also created many suburbs during the 1950s and 1960s.

In mid-2010, there were 2,754,440 residents in the city proper, while some 4.2&nbsp;million people lived in the greater Rome area (which can be approximately identified with its administrative metropolitan city, with a population density of about 800 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup> stretching over more than {{cvt|5,000|km2}}). Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 17.00% of the population compared to pensioners who number 20.76%. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners). The average age of a Roman resident is 43 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Rome grew by 6.54%, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://demo.istat.it/bil2007/index.html |title=Statistiche demografiche ISTAT |publisher=Demo.istat.it |access-date=3 February 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426215446/http://demo.istat.it/bil2007/index.html |archive-date=26 April 2009}}</ref> The current{{when|date=August 2017}} birth rate of Rome is 9.10 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Language===
{{Main|Roman dialect|Latin}}
[[Image:Nove-bone.jpg|thumb|Advertisement in [[Romanesco dialect]] at a subway station in Rome]]

Rome's historic contribution to language in a worldwide sense is extensive. Through the process of [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]], the peoples of Italy, [[Gallia]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and [[Dacia]] developed languages which derive directly from Latin and were adopted in large areas of the world, all through cultural influence, colonisation and migration. Moreover, also modern English, because of the [[Norman Conquest]], borrowed a large percentage of its vocabulary from the Latin language. The [[Latin alphabet|Roman or Latin alphabet]] is the most widely used writing system in the world used by the greatest number of languages.<ref>{{cite book |author=Ostler, N. |year=2007 |title=Ad Infinitum: A Biography of Latin |location=London |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0-8027-1679-8}}</ref>

The medieval [[Roman dialect]] belonged to the southern family of Italian dialects, and was thus much closer to the [[Neapolitan language]] than to the Florentine.<ref name=sie/><ref>{{cite web|title=Romanesco|url=http://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/romanesco/|website=www.treccani.it|publisher=Treccani|access-date=6 February 2015}}</ref> A typical example of Romanesco of that period is ''{{ill|Cronica dell'Anonimo Romano|lt=Vita di Cola di Rienzo|it}}'' ("Life of [[Cola di Rienzo]]"), written by an anonymous Roman during the 14th century.<ref name=sie>{{cite web|title=La Parlata romana|url=http://online.unistrasi.it/Avvisi/Laparlataromana.pdf|website=online.unistrasi.it|publisher=Università per stranieri di Siena|access-date=6 February 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206110011/http://online.unistrasi.it/Avvisi/Laparlataromana.pdf|archive-date=6 February 2015}}</ref> Starting with the 16th century, the Roman dialect underwent a stronger and stronger influence from the [[Tuscan dialect]] (from which modern Italian derives) starting with the reigns of the two [[House of Medici|Medici]] popes ([[Leo X]] and [[Clement VII]]) and with the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome in 1527]], two events which provoked a large immigration from [[Tuscany]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=D'Achille|first1=Paolo|title=Italiano di Roma|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/italiano-di-roma_(Enciclopedia_dell'Italiano)/|website=www.treccani.it|publisher=Treccani|access-date=6 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=dia>{{cite web|title=Dialetti|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/dialetti_(Enciclopedia_dell'Italiano)/|website=www.treccani.it|publisher=Treccani|access-date=6 February 2015}}</ref> Therefore, current Romanesco has grammar and roots that are rather different from other dialects in Central Italy.<ref name=dia/>

[[File:San Giovanni in Laterano 2021.jpg|thumb|right|[[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran]], Rome's Cathedral, built in 324, and partly rebuilt between 1660 and 1734]]
[[File:Santa Maria Maggiore Front.JPG|thumb|One of the [[Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome]], [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] is the city's largest [[Roman Catholic Marian church|Catholic Marian church]].]]

Much like the rest of Italy, Rome is predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]], and the city has been an important centre of religion and [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] for centuries, the base of the ancient Roman religion with the [[Pontifex Maximus|pontifex maximus]] and later the seat of the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and the pope. Before the arrival of the Christians in Rome, the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Religio Romana]] (literally, the "Roman Religion") was the major religion of the city in classical antiquity. The first gods held sacred by the Romans were [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the Most High, and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the god of war, and father of Rome's twin founders, [[Romulus and Remus]], according to tradition. Other deities such as [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] and [[Minerva]] were honoured. Rome was also the base of several mystery cults, such as [[Mithraic Mysteries|Mithraism]]. Later, after [[Saint Peter|St Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|St Paul]] were martyred in the city, and the first Christians began to arrive, Rome became Christian, and the [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] was constructed in 313 AD. Despite some interruptions (such as the [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon papacy]]), Rome has for centuries been the home of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]], otherwise known as the Pope.

Despite the fact that Rome is home to the [[Vatican City]] and St. Peter's Basilica, Rome's cathedral is the [[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran]], in the south-east of the city centre. There are around 900 churches in Rome in total. Aside from the cathedral itself, some others of note include the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]], the [[Basilica di San Clemente]], [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]] and the [[Church of the Gesu|Church of the Gesù]]. There are also the ancient [[Catacombs of Rome]] underneath the city. Numerous highly important religious educational institutions are also in Rome, such as the [[Pontifical Lateran University]], [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]], [[Pontifical Gregorian University]], and [[Pontifical Oriental Institute]].

Since the end of the [[Roman Republic]], Rome is also the centre of an important [[Jewish]] community,<ref>Coarelli, p. 308.</ref> which was once based in [[Trastevere]], and later in the [[Roman Ghetto]]. There lies also the major synagogue in Rome, the ''[[Great Synagogue of Rome|Tempio Maggiore]]''.

The territory of [[Vatican City]] is part of the ''Mons Vaticanus'' ([[Vatican Hill]]), and of the adjacent former Vatican Fields, where [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Apostolic Palace]], the [[Sistine Chapel]], and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman [[rione]] of [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] until 1929. Being separated from the city on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], the area was a suburb that was protected by being included within the walls of [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]], later expanded by the current fortification walls of [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]], [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]], and [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]]. When the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 that created the Vatican state was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop.

Rome has been a major [[Christian pilgrimage]] site since the [[Middle Ages]]. People from all over the [[Christian world]] visit Vatican City, within the city of Rome, the seat of the papacy. The city became a major [[pilgrimage]] site during the Middle Ages. Apart from brief periods as an independent city during the [[Middle Ages]], Rome kept its status as Papal capital and holy city for centuries, even when the Papacy [[Avignon papacy|briefly relocated]] to [[Avignon]] (1309–1377). Catholics believe that the Vatican is the last resting place of St. Peter. Pilgrimages to Rome can involve visits to many sites, both within Vatican City and in Italian territory. A popular stopping point is the [[scala sancta|Pilate's stairs]]: these are, according to the Christian tradition, the steps that led up to the [[praetorium]] of [[Pontius Pilate]] in [[Jerusalem]], which [[Jesus Christ]] stood on during his [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] on his way to trial.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1554541/Steps-Jesus-walked-to-trial-restored-to-glory.html |title=Steps Jesus walked to trial restored to glory |last=Moore |first=Malcolm |date=13 June 2007 |work=The Telegraph |access-date=22 August 2019 |language=en-GB |issn=0307-1235 |archive-date=30 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200430054419/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1554541/Steps-Jesus-walked-to-trial-restored-to-glory.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

In addition Rome hosts multiple [[Buddhist]]<ref>https://fondoambiente.it/eventi/tempo-al-tempio-monastero-buddhista-hua-yi-si</ref> temples, a [[Taoist]]<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome</ref> temple and a variety of [[Reconstructionist Roman religion|Roman modern pagan]] temples <ref>https://www.lagazzettadelmezzogiorno.it/video/video/1415466/culto-e-cultura-nel-segno-della-dea-sorge-a-taranto-il-tempio-di-minerva.html</ref> held by the Associazione Tradizionale Pietas which every year takes part in the religious festivities of the [[Natale di Roma]].

Rome constitutes a comune ''[[comune|speciale]]'', named ''"Roma Capitale"'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comune.roma.it/wps/portal/pcr?contentId=NEW151061&jp_pagecode=newsview.wp&ahew=contentId:jp_pagecode |title=Roma diventa Capitale |access-date=6 March 2012 |language=it |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205130517/http://www.comune.roma.it/wps/portal/pcr?contentId=NEW151061&jp_pagecode=newsview.wp&ahew=contentId:jp_pagecode |archive-date=5 February 2012}}</ref> and is the largest both in terms of land area and population among the 8,101 ''comuni'' of Italy. It is governed by a mayor and a city council. The seat of the ''comune'' is the ''Palazzo Senatorio'' on the [[Capitoline Hill]], the historic seat of the city government. The local administration in Rome is commonly referred to as ''"Campidoglio"'', the Italian name of the hill. ''Palazzo Senatorio'', seat of the municipality of Rome, has been a [[town hall]] since AD 1144, making it the oldest town hall in the world.<ref name="Falconi"/>

Since 1972, the city has been divided into administrative areas, called ''municipi'' (sing. ''municipio'') (until 2001 named ''circoscrizioni'').<ref>{{cite web |title=Territorio |publisher=Comune di Roma |access-date=5 October 2009 |url=http://www.comune.roma.it/was/wps/portal/!ut/p/_s.7_0_A/7_0_21L?menuPage=/Area_di_navigazione/Sezioni_del_portale/Dipartimenti_e_altri_uffici/Dipartimento_XV/www-9-romastatistica-9-it/Territorio/&flagSub= |language=it}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> They were created for administrative reasons to increase decentralisation in the city. Each ''municipio'' is governed by a president and a council of twenty-five members who are elected by its residents every five years. The ''municipi'' frequently cross the boundaries of the traditional, non-administrative divisions of the city. The municipi were originally 20, then 19,<ref>In 1992 after a [[referendum]] the XIX Circoscrizione became the ''[[Comune]]'' of [[Fiumicino]]</ref> and in 2013, their number was reduced to 15.<ref>{{cite news |title=Roma, sì all'accorpamento dei municipi: il Consiglio li riduce da 19 a 15 |url=http://www.ilmessaggero.it/roma/campidoglio/roma_municipi_accorpamento_consiglio_s_riduzione/notizie/257651.shtml# |access-date=13 March 2013 |newspaper=Il Messaggero |date=11 March 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316064219/http://www.ilmessaggero.it/roma/campidoglio/roma_municipi_accorpamento_consiglio_s_riduzione/notizie/257651.shtml |archive-date=16 March 2013}}</ref>

Rome is also divided into differing types of non-administrative units. The historic centre is divided into 22 ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'', all of which are located within the [[Aurelian Walls]] except [[Prati]] and [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]]. These originate from the [[14 regions of Augustan Rome]], which evolved in the Middle Ages into the [[14 regions of Medieval Rome|medieval rioni]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.romeartlover.it/Rioni.html |title=The "Rioni" of Rome |publisher=Romeartlover.it |access-date=3 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519060423/http://www.romeartlover.it/Rioni.html |archive-date=19 May 2009}}</ref> In the [[Renaissance]], under Pope [[Sixtus V]], they again reached fourteen, and their boundaries were finally defined under [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in 1743.

Rome is the principal town of the [[Metropolitan City of Rome]], operative since 1 January 2015. The Metropolitan City replaced the old [[Province of Rome|provincia di Roma]], which included the city's metropolitan area and extends further north until [[Civitavecchia]]. The Metropolitan City of Rome is the largest by area in Italy. At {{cvt|5352|km2}}, its dimensions are comparable to the region of [[Liguria]]. Moreover, the city is also the capital of the [[Lazio]] region.<ref>Artour.

Rome is the national capital of Italy and is the seat of the [[Politics of Italy|Italian Government]]. The official residences of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]] and the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]], the seats of both houses of the [[Parliament of Italy|Italian Parliament]] and that of the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Italian Constitutional Court]] are located in the historic centre. The state ministries are spread out around the city; these include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is located in [[Palazzo della Farnesina]] near the Olympic stadium.

Among the [[global cities]], Rome is unique in having two sovereign entities located entirely within its city limits, the Holy See, represented by the Vatican City State, and the territorially smaller [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]]. The Vatican is an enclave of the Italian [[capital city]] and a sovereign possession of the [[Holy See]], which is the Diocese of Rome and the supreme government of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. For this reason, Rome has sometimes been described as the capital of two states.<ref>{{cite web |title=Discorsi del Presidente Ciampi |url=http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/statico/ex-presidenti/Ciampi/dinamico/discorso.asp?id=21495 |publisher=Presidenza della Repubblica |access-date=17 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053829/http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/statico/ex-presidenti/Ciampi/dinamico/discorso.asp?id=21495 |archive-date=21 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Le istituzioni salutano Benedetto XVI |url=http://www.repubblica.it/2005/d/sezioni/esteri/nuovopapa/reazitalia/reazitalia.html |newspaper=La Repubblica |access-date=17 May 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302053332/http://www.repubblica.it/2005/d/sezioni/esteri/nuovopapa/reazitalia/reazitalia.html |archive-date=2 March 2013}}</ref> Rome is the seat of the so-called "Polo Romano" made up by three main international agencies of the [[United Nations]]: the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) and the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.parlamento.it/application/xmanager/projects/parlamento/file/repository/affariinternazionali/osservatorio/approfondimenti/PI0093.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402143221/http://www.parlamento.it/application/xmanager/projects/parlamento/file/repository/affariinternazionali/osservatorio/approfondimenti/PI0093.pdf |url-status=dead |title=parlamento.it |archive-date=2 April 2015}}</ref>

Rome has traditionally been involved in the process of European political integration. The [[Treaties of the EU]] are located in [[Palazzo della Farnesina]]. In 1957 the city hosted the signing of the [[Treaties of Rome|Treaty of Rome]], which established the [[European Economic Community]] (predecessor to the [[European Union]]), and also played host to the official signing of the proposed [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] in July 2004. Rome is the seat of the [[European Olympic Committee]] and of the [[NATO Defense College]]. The city is the place where the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Statute of the International Criminal Court]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] were formulated. The city hosts also other important international entities such as the [[IDLO]] (International Development Law Organisation), the [[ICCROM]] (International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property) and the [[UNIDROIT]] (International Institute for the Unification of Private Law).

As the capital of Italy, Rome hosts all the principal institutions of the nation, including the Presidency of the Republic, the government (and its single {{lang|it|Ministeri}}), the Parliament, the main judicial Courts, and the diplomatic representatives of all the countries for the states of Italy and Vatican City. Many international institutions are located in Rome, notably cultural and scientific ones, such as the American Institute, the British School, the French Academy, the Scandinavian Institutes, and the German Archaeological Institute. There are also specialised agencies of the United Nations, such as the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO). Rome also hosts major international and worldwide political and cultural organisations, such as the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD), [[World Food Programme]] (WFP), the [[NATO Defence College]], and the [[International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property]] (ICCROM).

Although the economy of Rome is characterised by the absence of heavy industry, and it is largely dominated by [[service (economics)|services]], high-technology companies (IT, aerospace, defence, telecommunications), research, construction and commercial activities (especially banking), and the huge development of tourism are very dynamic and extremely important to its economy. Rome's international airport, [[Fiumicino]], is the largest in Italy, and the city hosts the head offices of the vast majority of the major Italian companies, as well as the headquarters of three of the world's 100 largest companies: [[Enel]], [[Eni]], and [[Telecom Italia]].<ref name="Forbes">{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/2006/03/29/06f2k_worlds-largest-public-companies_land.html |title=The World's 2000 Largest Public Companies |first=Scott |last=DeCarlo |date=30 March 2006 |work=Forbes |access-date=16 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113092755/http://www.forbes.com/2006/03/29/06f2k_worlds-largest-public-companies_land.html |archive-date=13 January 2007}}</ref>

Universities, national radio and television and the movie industry in Rome are also important parts of the economy: Rome is also the hub of the [[Cinema of Italy|Italian film industry]], thanks to the Cinecittà studios, working since the 1930s. The city is also a centre for banking and insurance as well as electronics, energy, transport, and aerospace industries. Numerous international companies and agencies headquarters, government ministries, conference centres, sports venues, and museums are located in Rome's principal business districts: the [[Esposizione Universale Roma]] (EUR); the ''Torrino'' (further south from the EUR); the ''Magliana''; the ''Parco de' Medici-Laurentina'' and the so-called ''Tiburtina-valley'' along the ancient [[Via Tiburtina]].

Rome today is one of the most important tourist destinations of the world, due to the incalculable immensity of its archaeological and artistic treasures, as well as for the charm of its unique traditions, the beauty of its panoramic views, and the majesty of its magnificent "villas" (parks). Among the most significant resources are the many museums – [[Capitoline Museums]], [[Vatican Museums|the Vatican Museums]] and the {{lang|it|[[Galleria Borghese]]|italic=no}} and others dedicated to modern and contemporary art – [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]], [[fountain]]s, churches, [[palace]]s, historical buildings, the [[monument]]s and ruins of the [[Roman Forum]], and the [[Catacombs]].

====Fountains and aqueducts====
{{Main|List of fountains in Rome|List of aqueducts in the city of Rome}}
[[File:Trevi Fountain, Rome, Italy 2 - May 2007.jpg|thumb|Construction of the [[Trevi Fountain]] began during the time of Ancient Rome and was completed in 1762 by a design of [[Nicola Salvi]].]]

Rome is a city known for its numerous fountains, built-in all different styles, from Classical and Medieval, to Baroque and Neoclassical. The city has had [[fountain]]s for more than two thousand years, and they have provided drinking water and decorated the [[piazza]]s of Rome. During the [[Roman Empire]], in 98 AD, according to [[Sextus Julius Frontinus]], the Roman consul who was named ''[[Curator Aquarum|curator aquarum]]'' or guardian of the water of the city, Rome had nine [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] which fed 39 monumental fountains and 591 public basins, not counting the water supplied to the Imperial household, baths, and owners of private villas. Each of the major fountains was connected to two different aqueducts, in case one was shut down for service.<ref>Frontin, Les Aqueducs de la ville de Rome, translation and commentary by Pierre Grimal, Société d'édition Les Belles Lettres, Paris, 1944.</ref>

During the 17th and 18th century, the Roman popes reconstructed other degraded Roman aqueducts and built new display fountains to mark their termini, launching the golden age of the Roman fountain. The fountains of Rome, like the paintings of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], were expressions of the new style of Baroque art. In these fountains, sculpture became the principal element, and the water was used simply to animate and decorate the sculptures. They, like baroque gardens, were "a visual representation of confidence and power".<ref>''Italian Gardens, a Cultural History'', Helen Attlee. Francis Lincoln Limited, London 2006.</ref>

====Statues====
{{See also|Talking statues of Rome}}
[[File:Vierströmebrunnen-Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (27903447766).jpg|thumb|right|Fontana dei Fiumi by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], 1648]]

Rome is well known for its statues but, in particular, the [[talking statues of Rome]]. These are usually ancient statues which have become popular soapboxes for political and social discussion, and places for people to (often satirically) voice their opinions. There are two main talking statues: the [[Pasquino]] and the [[Marforio]], yet there are four other noted ones: [[il Babuino]], [[Madama Lucrezia]], [[il Facchino]] and [[Abbot Luigi]]. Most of these statues are ancient Roman or classical, and most of them also depict mythical gods, ancient people or legendary figures; il Pasquino represents [[Menelaus]], Abbot Luigi is an unknown Roman magistrate, il Babuino is supposed to be [[Silenus]], [[Marforio]] represents [[Oceanus]], Madama Lucrezia is a bust of [[Isis]], and [[il Facchino]] is the only non-Roman statue, created in 1580, and not representing anyone in particular. They are often, due to their status, covered with placards or [[graffiti]] expressing political ideas and points of view. Other statues in the city, which are not related to the talking statues, include those of the Ponte Sant'Angelo, or several monuments scattered across the city, such as that to [[Giordano Bruno]] in the Campo de'Fiori.

====Obelisks and columns====
{{Main|List of obelisks in Rome}}
[[File:Piazza del Popolo Obelisco Flaminio a Roma.jpg|thumb|[[Flaminio Obelisk]], [[Piazza del Popolo]]]]

The city hosts eight [[ancient Egypt]]ian and five [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[obelisk]]s, together with a number of more modern obelisks; there was also formerly (until 2005) an [[Aksumite Empire|ancient Ethiopian]] obelisk in Rome.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.initaly.com/regions/classic/obelisks.htm |title=Chasing Obelisks in Rome |publisher=Initaly.com |access-date=3 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206125357/http://initaly.com/regions/classic/obelisks.htm |archive-date=6 February 2010}}</ref> The city contains some of obelisks in [[piazza]]s, such as in [[Piazza Navona]], [[Saint Peter's Square|St Peter's Square]], [[Piazza di Monte Citorio|Piazza Montecitorio]], and [[Piazza del Popolo]], and others in [[villa]]s, [[thermae]] parks and gardens, such as in [[Villa Mattei|Villa Celimontana]], the [[Baths of Diocletian]], and the [[Pincian Hill]]. Moreover, the centre of Rome hosts also [[Trajan's column|Trajan]]'s and [[Column of Marcus Aurelius|Antonine Column]], two ancient Roman columns with spiral relief. The Column of Marcus Aurelius is located in [[Piazza Colonna]] and it was built around 180 AD by [[Commodus]] in memory of his parents. The [[Column of Marcus Aurelius]] was inspired by [[Trajan's Column]] at [[Trajan's Forum]], which is part of the [[Imperial Fora]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roundtheworldmagazine.com/free-things-to-do-in-rome/ |title=7 Free Things To Do In Rome |publisher=roundtheworldmagazin.com |access-date=17 January 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217200236/http://www.roundtheworldmagazine.com/free-things-to-do-in-rome/ |archive-date=17 February 2017 |date=12 January 2017}}</ref>

====Bridges====
{{Main|List of bridges in Rome}}
[[File:Bridge Vittorio Emanuele II at sunset.jpg|thumb|[[Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II]] at sunset]]

The city of Rome contains numerous famous bridges which cross the [[Tiber]]. The only bridge to remain unaltered until today from the classical age is [[Pons Fabricius|Ponte dei Quattro Capi]], which connects the [[Isola Tiberina]] with the left bank. The other surviving – albeit modified – ancient Roman bridges crossing the Tiber are [[Pons Cestius|Ponte Cestio]], [[Ponte Sant'Angelo]] and [[Ponte Milvio]]. Considering [[Ponte Nomentano]], also built during ancient Rome, which crosses the [[Aniene]], currently there are five ancient Roman bridges still remaining in the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citrag.it/archi/page/bridges/e_f_pn_ro.htm |title=The Bridges of Ancient Rome |publisher=Citrag.it |access-date=3 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113044759/http://www.citrag.it/archi/page/bridges/e_f_pn_ro.htm |archive-date=13 January 2010}}</ref> Other noteworthy bridges are [[Ponte Sisto]], the first bridge built in the Renaissance above Roman foundations; [[Ponte Rotto]], actually the only remaining arch of the ancient ''Pons Aemilius'', collapsed during the flood of 1598 and demolished at the end of the 19th century; and [[Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II]], a modern bridge connecting Corso Vittorio Emanuele and Borgo. Most of the city's public bridges were built in Classical or Renaissance style, but also in Baroque, Neoclassical and Modern styles. According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], the finest ancient bridge remaining in Rome is the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo]], which was completed in 135 AD, and was decorated with ten statues of the angels, designed by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]] in 1688.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/523159/SantAngelo-Bridge |title=Sant'Angelo Bridge |access-date=3 February 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109154613/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/523159/SantAngelo-Bridge |archive-date=9 January 2010}}</ref>

====Catacombs====
{{Main|Catacombs of Rome}}
[[File:PiusXItomb2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Vatican Necropolis|Vatican Caves]] are the location of many papal burials.]]

Rome has an extensive amount of ancient catacombs, or underground burial places under or near the city, of which there are at least forty, some discovered only in recent decades. Though most famous for Christian burials, they include [[Religion in ancient Rome|pagan]] and Jewish burials, either in separate catacombs or mixed together. The first large-scale catacombs were excavated from the 2nd century onwards. Originally they were carved through [[tuff]], a soft [[volcanic rock]], outside the boundaries of the city, because [[Roman law]] forbade burial places within city limits. Currently, maintenance of the catacombs is in the hands of the [[Pope|Papacy]] which has invested in the [[Salesians of Don Bosco]] the supervision of the Catacombs of St. Callixtus on the outskirts of Rome.

===Entertainment and performing arts===
{{Main|Music in Rome|Events in Rome}}
[[File:Teatro dell'Opera a Roma.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Teatro dell'Opera di Roma]] at the Piazza Beniamino Gigli]]

Rome is an important centre for music, and it has an intense musical scene, including several prestigious music conservatories and theatres. It hosts the [[Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia]] (founded in 1585), for which new concert halls have been built in the new [[Parco della Musica]], one of the largest musical venues in the world. Rome also has an opera house, the [[Teatro dell'Opera di Roma]], as well as several minor musical institutions. The city also played host to the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|Eurovision Song Contest]] in 1991 and the [[MTV Europe Music Awards 2004|MTV Europe Music Awards]] in 2004.

Rome has also had a major impact on music history. The [[Roman School]] was a group of composers of predominantly church music, which were active in the city during the 16th and 17th centuries, therefore spanning the late [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and early [[Baroque music|Baroque]] eras. The term also refers to the music they produced. Many of the composers had a direct connection to the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and the [[Sistine Chapel|papal chapel]], though they worked at several churches; stylistically they are often contrasted with the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]] of composers, a concurrent movement which was much more progressive. By far the most famous composer of the Roman School is [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], whose name has been associated for four hundred years with smooth, clear, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] perfection. However, there were other composers working in Rome, and in a variety of styles and forms.

Between 1960 and 1970 Rome was considered to be as a "new Hollywood" because of the many actors and directors who worked there; Via Vittorio Veneto had transformed into a glamour place where you could meet famous people.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date= |title=LA NEW HOLLYWOOD: IL CONTESTO POLITICO-SOCIALE |url=http://www.unife.it/letterefilosofia/comunicazione/insegnamenti/storia_cinema/materiale_didattico/a-a-2016-2017/la-new-hollywood-il-contesto-politico-sociale-i-temi-lo-stile |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210125210955/http://www.unife.it/letterefilosofia/comunicazione/insegnamenti/storia_cinema/materiale_didattico/a-a-2016-2017/la-new-hollywood-il-contesto-politico-sociale-i-temi-lo-stile |archive-date=25 January 2021 |access-date=2021-01-31 |website=Unife.it |publisher=Università degli Studi di Ferrara |language=it}}</ref>

===Fashion===
[[File:Fontana.della.barcaccia.arp.jpg|thumb|[[Via Condotti]]]]

Rome is also widely recognised as a world [[fashion capital]]. Although not as important as Milan, Rome is the fourth most important centre for fashion in the world, according to the 2009 [[Global Language Monitor]] after [[Milan]], [[New York City|New York]], and [[Paris]], and beating [[London]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.languagemonitor.com/popular-culture/fashion |title=The Global Language Monitor » Fashion |publisher=Languagemonitor.com |date=20 July 2009 |access-date=17 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101191133/http://www.languagemonitor.com/popular-culture/fashion |archive-date=1 November 2009}}</ref>

Major luxury fashion houses and jewellery chains, such as [[Valentino SpA|Valentino]], [[Bulgari]], [[Fendi]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fendi.com/ |title=Fendi |publisher=fendi.com |access-date=17 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131001741/http://www.fendi.com/ |archive-date=31 January 2010}}</ref> [[Laura Biagiotti]], [[Brioni (brand)|Brioni]], and [[Renato Balestra]], are headquartered or were founded in the city. Also, other major labels, such as [[Gucci]], [[Chanel]], [[Prada]], [[Dolce & Gabbana]], [[Armani]], and [[Versace]] have luxury boutiques in Rome, primarily along its prestigious and upscale [[Via Condotti|Via dei Condotti]].

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Roman cuisine}}
[[File:Espaguetis carbonara.jpg|thumb|''Spaghetti [[Carbonara|alla carbonara]]'', a typical Roman dish]]

Rome's cuisine has evolved through centuries and periods of social, cultural, and political changes. Rome became a major gastronomical centre during the [[Ancient Rome|ancient age]]. [[Ancient Roman cuisine]] was highly influenced by Ancient Greek culture, and after, the empire's enormous expansion exposed Romans to many new, provincial culinary habits and cooking techniques.<ref>{{Cite news |agency=Associated Press |date=2021-09-28 |title=Packs Of Ravenous Wild Boars Are Ransacking Rome |language=en |work=NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/2021/09/28/1041124299/wild-boars-rome-streets-food |access-date=2022-04-11}}</ref>

Later, during the [[Renaissance]], Rome became well known as a centre of high-cuisine, since some of the best chefs of the time worked for the popes. An example of this was [[Bartolomeo Scappi]], who was a chef working for [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]]; he acquired fame in 1570 when his cookbook ''Opera dell'arte del cucinare'' was published. In the book he lists approximately 1,000 recipes of the Renaissance [[cuisine]] and describes cooking techniques and tools, giving the first known picture of a [[fork]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Rolland |first=Jacques |title=The food encyclopedia |publisher=Robert Rose |location=Toronto |year=2006 |isbn=0-7788-0150-0 |oclc=70176309 |page=273}}</ref>
[[File:Abbacchio Pasquale.jpg|thumb|''[[Abbacchio]] alla romana'']]
The [[Testaccio]], Rome's trade and slaughterhouse area, was often known as the "belly" or "slaughterhouse" of Rome, and was inhabited by butchers, or ''vaccinari''.<ref name="Eyewitness Travel 2006 pg. 312 - 313">Eyewitness Travel (2006), pg. 312 – 313</ref> The most common or ancient Roman cuisine included the "fifth quarter".<ref name="Eyewitness Travel 2006 pg. 312 - 313"/> The old-fashioned ''[[coda alla vaccinara]]'' (oxtail cooked in the way of butchers)<ref name="Eyewitness Travel 2006 pg. 312 - 313"/> is still one of the city's most popular meals and is part of most of Rome's restaurants' menus. Lamb is also a very popular part of Roman cuisine, and is often roasted with spices and herbs.<ref name="Eyewitness Travel 2006 pg. 312 - 313"/>

In the modern age, the city developed its own peculiar cuisine, based on products of the nearby [[Roman Campagna|Campagna]], as lamb and vegetables ([[artichoke|globe artichokes]] are common).<ref>{{cite book |title=Culinaria Italy |first=Claudia |last=Piras |publisher=Culinaria Konemann |year=2000 |isbn=3-8290-2901-2 |oclc=881159457 |page=291}}</ref> In parallel, Roman Jews – present in the city since the 1st century BC – developed their own cuisine, the ''cucina giudaico-romanesca''.

Examples of Roman dishes include ''[[saltimbocca]] alla romana'' – a veal cutlet, Roman-style, topped with raw ham and sage and simmered with white wine and butter; ''[[carciofi alla romana]]'' – artichokes Roman-style, outer leaves removed, stuffed with mint, garlic, breadcrumbs and braised; ''[[carciofi alla giudia]]'' – artichokes fried in olive oil, typical of Roman Jewish cooking, outer leaves removed, stuffed with mint, garlic, breadcrumbs and braised; ''[[Carbonara|spaghetti alla carbonara]]'' – [[spaghetti]] with [[bacon]], [[egg (food)|eggs]] and ''[[pecorino]]''; and ''[[Gnocchi alla romana|gnocchi di semolino alla romana]]'' – [[semolina]] dumpling, Roman-style.<ref>{{cite book |last=Carnacina |author2=Buonassisi, Vincenzo |first=Luigi |title=Roma in Cucina |publisher=Giunti Martello |location=Milano |year=1975 |language=it}}</ref>

Founded in 1937 by [[Benito Mussolini]], the studios were bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] during the Second World War. In the 1950s, Cinecittà was the filming location for several large American film productions, and subsequently became the studio most closely associated with [[Federico Fellini]]. Today, Cinecittà is the only studio in the world with pre-production, production, and full post-production facilities on one lot, allowing directors and producers to walk in with their script and "walkout" with a completed film.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

[[Association football]] is the most popular sport in Rome, as in the rest of the country. The city hosted the final games of the [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]] and [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]. The latter took place in the [[Stadio Olimpico]], which is also the shared home stadium for local [[Serie A]] clubs [[SS Lazio]], founded in 1900, and [[AS Roma]], founded in 1927, whose rivalry in the [[Derby della Capitale]] has become a staple of Roman sports culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SPORT/football/10/22/first11.derbies/index.html |title=Football First 11: Do or die derbies |publisher=CNN |date=22 October 2008 |access-date=5 October 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017011443/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SPORT/football/10/22/first11.derbies/index.html |archive-date=17 October 2014}}</ref> Footballers who play for these teams and are also born in the city tend to become especially popular, as has been the case with players such as [[Francesco Totti]] and [[Daniele De Rossi]] (both for AS Roma), and [[Alessandro Nesta]] (for SS Lazio).

[[File:Stadio_dei_Marmi.jpg|right|thumb|[[Stadio dei Marmi]]]]

Rome hosted the [[1960 Summer Olympics]], with great success, using many ancient sites such as the [[Villa Borghese gardens|Villa Borghese]] and the [[Baths of Caracalla|Thermae of Caracalla]] as venues. For the Olympic Games many new facilities were built, notably the new large Olympic Stadium (which was then enlarged and renewed to host several matches and the final of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]), the [[Stadio Flaminio]], the Villaggio Olimpico (Olympic Village, created to host the athletes and redeveloped after the games as a residential district), ecc. Rome made a [[Rome bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics|bid]] to host the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] but it was withdrawn.<ref name="olympic.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/media?articleid=138217 |title=Media |publisher=Olympic.org |access-date=15 September 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019052200/http://www.olympic.org/media?articleid=138217 |archive-date=19 October 2011}}</ref><ref name="Bladesplace.id.au">{{cite web |url=http://www.bladesplace.id.au/olympic-games-candidates.html |title=Candidate Cities for Future Olympic Games |publisher=Bladesplace.id.au |access-date=17 October 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012174517/http://www.bladesplace.id.au/olympic-games-candidates.html |archive-date=12 October 2009}}</ref>

Further, Rome hosted the [[EuroBasket 1991]] and is home to the internationally recognised basketball team [[Virtus Roma]]. [[Rugby union]] is gaining wider acceptance. Until 2011 the Stadio Flaminio was the home stadium for the [[Italy national rugby union team]], which has been playing in the [[Six Nations Championship]] since 2000. The team now plays home games at the Stadio Olimpico because the Stadio Flaminio needs works of renovation in order to improve both its capacity and safety. Rome is home to local rugby union teams such as [[Rugby Roma Olimpic|Rugby Roma]] (winner of five Italian championships), [[Unione Rugby Capitolina]] and [[S.S. Lazio Rugby 1927]] (rugby union branch of the multisport club S.S. Lazio).

Every May, Rome hosts the [[Italian Open (tennis)|Italian Open]], an [[ATP Masters 1000 tournaments|ATP Masters 1000]] tennis tournament, on the clay courts of the [[Foro Italico]]. Cycling was popular in the post-World War II period, although its popularity has faded. Rome has hosted the final portion of the [[Giro d'Italia]] three times, in 1911, 1950, and 2009. Other local sports teams include volleyball ([[M. Roma Volley]]), [[handball]] or [[water polo|waterpolo]].

Rome is at the centre of the radial network of roads that roughly follow the lines of the ancient Roman roads which began at the [[Capitoline Hill]] and connected Rome with its empire. Today Rome is circled, at a distance of about {{cvt|10|km|mi|0}} from the Capitol, by the ring-road (the [[Grande Raccordo Anulare]] or GRA).

Due to its location in the centre of the Italian peninsula, Rome is the principal [[railway node]] for central Italy. Rome's main railway station, [[Roma Termini railway station|Termini]], is one of the largest railway stations in Europe and the most heavily used in Italy, with around 400 thousand travellers passing through every day. The second-largest station in the city, [[Roma Tiburtina railway station|Roma Tiburtina]], has been redeveloped as a [[High-speed rail in Italy|high-speed rail]] terminus.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://eurostar-av.trenitalia.com/it/progetto/stazioni_rinnovate/roma_tiburtina.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061203063001/http://eurostar-av.trenitalia.com/it/progetto/stazioni_rinnovate/roma_tiburtina.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 December 2006 |title=Eurostar Italia Alta Velocità |date=3 December 2006}}</ref> As well as frequent high-speed day trains to all major Italian cities, Rome is linked nightly by 'boat train' sleeper services to Sicily, and internationally by overnight sleeper services to Munich and Vienna.

Rome is served by three airports. The intercontinental [[Leonardo da Vinci–Fiumicino Airport|Leonardo da Vinci International Airport]], Italy's chief airport is located in the nearby [[Fiumicino]], south-west of Rome. The older [[Ciampino–G. B. Pastine International Airport|Rome Ciampino Airport]] is a joint civilian and military airport. It is commonly referred to as "Ciampino Airport", as it is located beside [[Ciampino]], south-east of Rome. A third airport, the [[Rome Urbe Airport]], is a small, low-traffic airport located about {{cvt|6|km|0}} north of the city centre, which handles most helicopter and private flights. The main airport system of the city (composed of Fiumicino and Ciampino), with 32.8 million passengers transported in 2022, is the second busiest airport system in Italy.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Statistiche Dati di Traffico Aeroportuale Italiano |url=https://assaeroporti.com/statistiche/ |access-date=2023-02-21 |website=Assaeroporti |language=it-IT}}</ref>

Although the city has its own quarter on the Mediterranean Sea ([[Ostia (Rome)|Lido di Ostia]]), this has only a marina and a small channel-harbour for fishing boats. The main harbour which serves Rome is [[Port of Civitavecchia]], located about {{cvt|62|km|abbr=off}} northwest of the city.<ref>{{cite web |title=Porti di Roma |url=http://www.port-of-rome.org/ |access-date=6 March 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307140526/http://www.port-of-rome.org/ |archive-date=7 March 2015}}</ref>

The city suffers from traffic problems largely due to this radial street pattern, making it difficult for Romans to move easily from the vicinity of one of the radial roads to another without going into the historic centre or using the ring-road. These problems are not helped by the limited size of Rome's metro system when compared to other cities of similar size. Rome has only 21 taxis for every 10,000 inhabitants, far below other major European cities.<ref>{{cite news |title=Central Rome Streets Blocked by Taxi Drivers |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/world/europe/30rome.html?scp=93&sq=Rome&st=nyt |date=30 November 2007 |access-date=10 February 2008 |first=Peter |last=Kiefer |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417112759/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/world/europe/30rome.html?scp=93&sq=Rome&st=nyt |archive-date=17 April 2009}}</ref>{{Better source needed|28=January 2024|reason=data is out of date|date=January 2024}} Chronic congestion caused by cars during the 1970s and 1980s led to restrictions being placed on vehicle access to the inner city-centre during daylight hours. Areas, where these restrictions apply, are known as Limited Traffic Zones (''Zona a Traffico Limitato'' (ZTL)). More recently, heavy night-time traffic in [[Trastevere]], [[Testaccio]] and [[San Lorenzo (Rome)|San Lorenzo]] has led to the creation of night-time ZTLs in those districts.

A three-line metro system called the ''[[Rome Metro|Metropolitana]]'' operates in Rome. Construction on the first branch started in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dyson |first=Stephen L. |title=Archaeology, Ideology and Urbanism in Rome from the Grand Tour to Berlusconi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ECCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA192 |year=2019 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-87459-5 |page=192 |access-date=22 August 2019 |archive-date=23 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200523031404/https://books.google.com/books?id=-ECCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA192 |url-status=live}}</ref> The line had been planned to quickly connect the [[Roma Termini railway station|main railway station]] with the newly planned E42 area in the southern suburbs, where 1942 the [[List of world expositions|World Fair]] was supposed to be held. The event never took place because of war, but the area was later partly redesigned and renamed [[EUR, Rome|Esposizione Universale Roma]] in the 1950s to serve as a modern business district. The line was finally opened in 1955, and it is now the south part of the B Line.

The A line opened in 1980 from Ottaviano to Anagnina stations, later extended in stages (1999–2000) to Battistini. In the 1990s, an extension of the B line was opened from Termini to Rebibbia. The A and B lines intersect at Roma Termini station. A new branch of the B line (B1) opened on 13 June 2012 after an estimated building cost of €500&nbsp;million. B1 connects to line B at Piazza Bologna and has four stations over a distance of {{cvt|3.9|km|mi|0}}.

A third line, the C line, is under construction with an estimated cost of €3&nbsp;billion and will have 30 stations over a distance of {{cvt|25.5|km|mi|0}}. It will partly replace the existing [[Roma Termini railway station|Termini]]-Pantano rail line. It will feature full automated, driverless trains.<ref>{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Kington |title=Roman remains threaten metro |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/14/italy.artnews |work=[[The Guardian|Guardian]] |date=14 May 2007 |access-date=10 August 2008 |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831074912/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/14/italy.artnews |archive-date=31 August 2013}}</ref> The first section with 15 stations connecting Pantano with the quarter of Centocelle in the eastern part of the city, opened on 9 November 2014.<ref>{{cite news |title=Metro C, apre la Pantano-Centocelle: folla di romani all'inaugurazione |url=http://www.ilmessaggero.it/ROMA/CRONACA/metro_c_atac_sindaco_apertura_pantano_centocelle/notizie/1002186.shtml |access-date=11 November 2014 |work=Il Messaggero |date=9 November 2014 |language=it |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111014416/http://ilmessaggero.it/ROMA/CRONACA/metro_c_atac_sindaco_apertura_pantano_centocelle/notizie/1002186.shtml |archive-date=11 November 2014}}</ref> The end of the work was scheduled in 2015, but archaeological findings often delay underground construction work.

A fourth line, D line, is also planned. It will have 22 stations over a distance of {{cvt|20|km|mi|0}}. The first section was projected to open in 2015 and the final sections before 2035, but due to the city's financial crisis, the project has been put on hold.

Above-ground public transport in Rome is made up of a bus, tram and urban train network (FR lines). The bus network has in excess of 350 bus lines and over eight thousand bus stops, whereas the more-limited tram system has {{cvt|39|km|0}} of track and 192 stops.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atac.roma.it/index.asp?p=2&i=616&o=3&m=1&a=7&ci=45&tpg=2&lingua=ITA |title=ATAC |website=atac.roma.it |language=it |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106212503/http://www.atac.roma.it/index.asp?p=2&i=616&o=3&m=1&a=7&ci=45&tpg=2&lingua=ITA |archive-date=6 January 2012 |url-status=dead |access-date=22 August 2019}}</ref> There are also [[trolleybus]]es.<ref name="juts2009">{{cite book |title=Jane's Urban Transport Systems 2009–2010 |last=Webb |first=Mary |publisher=[[Jane's Information Group]] |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7106-2903-6 |location=Coulsdon |oclc=316826596}}</ref>
