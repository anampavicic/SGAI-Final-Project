==History==
{{Main|History of Anchorage, Alaska}}
{{For timeline}}
Archaeological evidence discovered at [[Beluga Point]] just south of Anchorage proper, along the Turnagain Arm, suggests that habitation of the Cook Inlet began 5,000 years ago by a group of [[Alutiiq]] people who arrived by [[kayak]]. As this population moved on, they were followed by a second wave of Alutiiq occupation beginning roughly 4,000 years ago, followed by a third wave around 2,000 years ago. Around 500 AD the [[Chugach|Chugach Alutiiq]] were displaced by the arrival of Dena'ina [[Athabaskan]]s, who entered through the mountain passes. The [[Denaʼina|Dena'ina]] had no fixed settlements, migrating throughout the area with the seasonal changes, fishing along coastal streams and rivers in the summer, hunting moose, mountain goats, and Dall sheep in early fall, and picking berries in late fall. They tended to winter near trading junctions along common travel routes, where they traded with other Dena'ina and [[Ahtna]] tribes from nearby areas.<ref name="Aunt Phil's Trunk pp. 1">''Aunt Phil's Trunk: Bringing Alaska's history alive! Volume 3'' by Laurel Bill, Phyllis Carlson – Aunt Phil's Trunk LLC 2016 pp. 1–5</ref>

[[Captain James Cook]] was among the first European explorers to map the Alaskan coastline, and many of the geographical features (mountains, islands, rivers, waterways, etc.) still bear the names he gave them. Cook was searching for the fabled [[Northwest Passage]], a route that would provide a shorter means of reaching the Pacific from Europe than the difficult [[Northeast Passage]] around the north of Asia, or south around South America. On May 15, 1778, after enduring weeks of hard weather, Cook turned into an inlet between two landmarks he called Cape Douglas and [[Augustine Volcano|Mount St. Augustine]]. He anchored his ship, [[HMS Resolution (1771)|HMS ''Resolution'']], at a place he called "Anchor Point" (later named "Anchorage" as another [[Anchor Point, Alaska|Anchor Point]] existed to the south near [[Homer, Alaska]]), near a creek he dubbed "Ship Creek" nestled between two large [[Arm (geography)|arms]] (waterways). Cook spent ten days exploring the inlet named after him. He first sent [[William Bligh]] to scout the north arm, where he met with the [[Denaʼina language|Dena'ina Natives]] of the [[Eklutna]] area, who told him the name of the [[Knik Arm]] and that it was not the Northwest Passage, but rather an outlet for two rivers (the [[Knik River|Knik]] and [[Matanuska River]]s). Cook then sailed south to scout the other arm, and in a bad mood after running the ''Resolution'' aground on a sandbar on his way back out of the shallow waters, called it "River Turnagain", having found no sign of the passage there either.<ref>''Captain Cook: Master of the Seas'' by Frank McLynn, Yale University Press, 2011{{ISBN?}}{{page needed|date=October 2021}}</ref>

In the 19th century, Russian presence in South-Central Alaska was well-established. The Russians placed trading posts along Cook Inlet, such as the [[Shelikhov-Golikov Company]]'s post at ''Niteh'' on the Palmer Flats (between the Knik and Matanuska Rivers), which in turn created small agricultural communities in [[Ninilchik]], [[Seldovia]], and [[Eklutna, Anchorage|Eklutna]]. The Russians also introduced diseases such as [[smallpox]] that had devastating effects on the local Native population, which plummeted by half just 10 years after the first census.<ref name="Aunt Phil's Trunk pp. 1"/>

In 1867, U.S. Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] brokered a deal to [[Alaska Purchase|purchase Alaska]] from Imperial Russia for $7.2 million, or about two cents an acre (${{Inflation|US-GDP|7.2|1867|r=1}} million in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} dollars).{{Inflation-fn|US-GDP}} His political rivals lampooned the deal as "[[Seward's folly]]", "Seward's icebox" and "Walrussia". In 1888, gold was discovered along [[Turnagain Arm]] just south of modern-day Anchorage, leading to a new influx of prospectors, and small towns such as Spenard, Hope, Rainbow, Bird, Indian, and [[Girdwood, Anchorage, Alaska|Girdwood]] began to spring up.

Alaska became an [[Organized incorporated territories of the United States|organized incorporated United States territory]] in 1912. Anchorage, unlike every other large town in Alaska south of the [[Brooks Range]], was neither a fishing nor mining camp. The area surrounding Anchorage lacks significant economic metal ores. A number of [[Dena'ina people|Dena'ina]] settlements existed along Knik Arm for years. By 1911 the families of J. D. "Bud" Whitney and Jim St. Clair lived at the mouth of [[Ship Creek]] and were joined there by a young forest ranger, Jack Brown, and his bride, Nellie, in 1912.<ref name=mormon>{{cite book |title=A Gathering of Saints in Alaska: an informal chronicle of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the state of Alaska |date=1983 |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |location=Alaska |pages=306}}</ref>

The city grew from its happenstance choice as a site for railroad construction to begin in 1914. The waters near Ship Creek were deep enough for barges and small ships to dock, and under the direction of [[Frederick Mears]], it became a railroad-construction port for the [[Alaska Engineering Commission]]. The area near the mouth of [[Ship Creek, Alaska|Ship Creek]], where the railroad headquarters was, quickly became a [[tent city]]. Anchorage formed at a time when proponents of [[Prohibition]] were gaining traction, and as part of an effort to stem the flow of the alcohol trade, at the direction of President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and with the symmetry of the US Army, a town site was mapped out on higher ground to the south of the tent city, with the condition that a person's land could be repossessed if caught breaking the alcohol laws.<ref name="Aunt Phil's Trunk pp. 1"/> Anchorage has been noted in the years since for its order and rigidity compared with other Alaska town sites.<ref name="ADCRF">{{cite web |url=http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/commdb/CF_BLOCK.cfm?Comm_Boro_Name=Anchorage&Data_Type=generalOverview&submit2=GettData |title=Community Database Online, Anchorage |publisher=Alaska Division of Community and Regional Affairs |access-date=July 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324091343/http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/commdb/CF_BLOCK.cfm?Comm_Boro_Name=Anchorage&Data_Type=generalOverview&submit2=GettData |archive-date=March 24, 2012}}</ref> In 1915, territorial governor [[John Franklin Alexander Strong]] encouraged residents to change the city's name to one that had "more significance and local associations".<ref name="PrestonJones">{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Preston |date=2010 |title=City for Empire: An Anchorage History, 1914–1941 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tq07VrebnpkC&pg=PA169 |publisher=University of Alaska Press |pages=169–70 |isbn=978-1602230859 |access-date=February 22, 2016 |archive-date=August 17, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817093823/https://books.google.com/books?id=tq07VrebnpkC&pg=PA169 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the summer of that year, residents held a vote to change the city's name; a plurality favored the name "Alaska City",<ref name="PrestonJones"/> but the territorial government ultimately declined to change the city's name.<ref name="PrestonJones"/> Anchorage was incorporated on November 23, 1920.<ref name="ADCRF"/>

Construction of the [[Alaska Railroad]] continued until its completion in 1923. The city's economy in the 1920s and 1930s centered on the railroad. Colonel Otto F. Ohlson, the [[Swedes|Swedish]]-born general manager of the railroad for nearly two decades, became a symbol of residents' contempt due to the firm control he maintained over the railroad's affairs, which by extension became control over economic and other aspects of life in Alaska.
[[File:Anchorage 1953 FWS.jpg|thumb|Fourth Avenue in 1953, looking east from near I Street. Just ten years before, the retail area shown in the foreground was mostly an industrial area, housing lumber yards and similar uses.]]

Between the 1930s and the 1950s, the city experienced massive growth as [[air transportation]] and the military became increasingly important. Aviation operations in Anchorage commenced along the firebreak south of town (today's [[Delaney Park Strip]]), which residents also used as a [[golf course]]. An increase in air traffic led to clearing of a site directly east of town site boundaries starting in 1929; this became [[Merrill Field]], which served as Anchorage's primary airport during the 1930s and 1940s, until [[Anchorage International Airport]] superseded it in 1951. Merrill Field still sees a significant amount of [[general aviation]] traffic.

[[Elmendorf Air Force Base]] and the United States Army's [[Fort Richardson (Alaska)|Fort Richardson]] were constructed in the 1940s, and served as the city's primary economic engine until the 1968 [[Prudhoe Bay Oil Field|Prudhoe Bay discovery]] shifted the thrust of the economy toward the oil industry.

Rebuilding and recovery dominated the remainder of the 1960s.

In 1968, [[ARCO]] discovered oil in [[Prudhoe Bay, Alaska|Prudhoe Bay]] on the [[Alaska North Slope]], and the resulting [[oil boom]] spurred further growth in Anchorage. In 1975, the City of Anchorage and the Greater Anchorage Area Borough (which includes [[Eagle River (Anchorage)|Eagle River]], [[Girdwood, Anchorage|Girdwood]], Glen Alps, and several other communities) merged into the geographically larger Municipality of Anchorage<ref name="ADCRF" /> The city continued to grow in the 1980s, and capital projects and an aggressive beautification campaign took place.

Several attempts have been made to move Alaska's state capital from [[Juneau]] to Anchorage, or to a site closer to Anchorage. The motivation is straightforward: the "railbelt" between Anchorage and Fairbanks contains most of Alaska's population. Robert Atwood, owner of the ''Anchorage Times'' and a tireless booster for the city, championed the move. Alaskans rejected attempts to move the capital in 1960 and 1962, but in 1974, as Alaska's center of population moved away from Southeast Alaska and to the railbelt, voters approved it. Communities such as Fairbanks and much of rural Alaska opposed moving the capital to Anchorage for fear of concentrating more power in the state's largest city. As a result, in 1976, voters approved a plan to build a new capital city near [[Willow, Alaska|Willow]], about {{cvt|70|mi|km}} north of Anchorage. In the 1978 election, opponents to the move reacted by campaigning to defeat a nearly $1 billion bond issue to fund construction of the new capitol building and related facilities (${{Inflation|US-GDP|1|1978}} billion in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} dollars).{{Inflation-fn|US-GDP}}. Later attempts to move the capital or the legislature to [[Wasilla, Alaska|Wasilla]], north of Anchorage, also failed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.akhistorycourse.org/articles/article.php?artID=406 |title=Alaska History and Cultural Studies – Governing Alaska – The Capital of Alaska |work=akhistorycourse.org |access-date=October 18, 2015 |archive-date=January 17, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117152401/http://www.akhistorycourse.org/articles/article.php?artID=406 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Anchorage has over twice as many state employees as Juneau, and is to a considerable extent the center of Alaska's state and federal government activity.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

[[File:Anchorage by Sentinel-2, 2020-08-17.jpg|alt=|thumb|Satellite view taken August 2020. The Municipality encompasses the entire land mass between the Knik River and Knik Arm (top), and the Turnagain Arm (bottom), with the Mat-Su borough to the north, the Kenai Peninsula to the south, and Whittier just east of the mountains (lower right). The [[city proper]] lies on the coastal [[alluvial plain]] at the headwaters of Cook Inlet, between the two arms (left of center).]]
Anchorage is in [[Southcentral Alaska]]. At [[61st parallel north|61 degrees north]], it lies slightly farther north than [[Oslo]], [[Stockholm]], [[Helsinki]] and [[Saint Petersburg]], but not as far north as [[Reykjavík]] or [[Murmansk]]. It is northeast of the [[Alaska Peninsula]], [[Kodiak Island]], and [[Cook Inlet]], due north of the [[Kenai Peninsula]], northwest of [[Prince William Sound]] and the [[Alaska Panhandle]], and nearly due south of [[Denali]].

The city is on a strip of coastal lowland and extends up the lower alpine slopes of the [[Chugach Mountains]]. Point Campbell, the westernmost point of Anchorage on the mainland, juts out into [[Cook Inlet]] near its northern end, at which point it splits into two [[Arm (geography)|arms]]. To the south is Turnagain Arm, a fjord that has some of the world's highest tides. Knik Arm, another tidal inlet, lies to the west and north. The [[Chugach Mountains]] on the east form a boundary to development, but not to the city limits, which encompass part of the wild alpine territory of [[Chugach State Park]].

The city's sea coast consists mostly of treacherous [[mudflats]]. Newcomers and tourists are warned not to walk in this area because of extreme tidal changes and the very fine glacial [[silt]]. Unwary victims have walked onto the solid seeming silt revealed when the tide is out and have become stuck in the mud. The two recorded instances of this occurred in 1961 and 1988.<ref>{{cite book |title=Danger Stalks the Land: Alaskan Tales of Death and Survival |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fGZ1CPK5GNoC |first=Larry |last=Kaniut |publisher=St. Martins Press |year=1999 |pages=2–6, 287–91 |isbn=978-1466824898 |access-date=March 15, 2018 |archive-date=July 26, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200726003645/https://books.google.com/books?id=fGZ1CPK5GNoC |url-status=live }}</ref>

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the municipality has an area of 1,961.1 square miles (5,079.2&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>); 1,697.2 square miles (4,395.8&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of which is land and 263.9 square miles (683.4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of it is water. The total area is 13.5% water.

Boroughs and census areas next to the Municipality of Anchorage are [[Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska|Matanuska-Susitna Borough]] to the north, [[Kenai Peninsula Borough, Alaska|Kenai Peninsula Borough]] to the south and [[Chugach Census Area, Alaska|Chugach Census Area]] to the east. The [[Chugach National Forest]], a national [[protected area]], extends into the southern part of the municipality, near [[Girdwood, Anchorage|Girdwood]] and [[Portage (Anchorage)|Portage]].

A diverse wildlife population exists within urban Anchorage and the surrounding area. Approximately 250 [[American black bear|black bears]] and 60 [[grizzly bear]]s live in the area. Bears are regularly sighted within the city. [[Moose]] are also a common sight; in the Anchorage Bowl, there is a summer population of approximately 250 moose, increasing to as many as 1,000 during the winter. They are a hazard to drivers, with over 100 moose killed by cars each year.

Within the Municipality there are also a number of streams that host [[salmon]] runs. Fishing for salmon at Ship Creek next to downtown is popular in the summer.

Due to its proximity to active [[volcanoes]], ash hazards are a significant, though infrequent, occurrence.

==Economy==
[[File:Anchorage Visitor Information Center.jpg|thumb|The Anchorage Visitor Information Center, downtown on 4th Avenue]]

Anchorage's largest economic sectors include transportation, military, municipal, state and federal government, tourism, corporate headquarters (including regional headquarters for [[multinational corporation]]s) and resource extraction. Large portions of the local economy depend on Anchorage's geographical location and surrounding [[natural resources]]. Anchorage's economy traditionally has seen steady growth, though not quite as rapid as many places in the [[Outside (Alaska)|lower 48 states]]. With the notable exception of a real estate-related crash in the mid-to-late 1980s, which saw the failure of numerous financial institutions, it does not experience as much pain during economic downturns.{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}

The [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport]] (TSAIA) is the world's fourth busiest airport for cargo traffic, surpassed only by [[Memphis International Airport|Memphis]], [[Hong Kong International Airport|Hong Kong]], and [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport|Shanghai Pudong]]. This traffic is strongly linked to Anchorage's location along [[great circle]] routes between Asia and the lower 48. In addition, the airport has an abundant supply of jet fuel from in-state refineries in [[North Pole, Alaska|North Pole]] and [[Kenai, Alaska|Kenai]].<!--I should know this already, though a quickie web search wasn't of much help. Even though it's called the "Kenai Refinery," isn't it actually located in Nikiski?--> This [[jet fuel]] is transported to the [[Port of Anchorage]], then by rail or pipeline to the airport.

[[File:Anchorage Alaska aerial view.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the [[Port of Anchorage]] on Cook Inlet in 1999]]
The [[Port of Anchorage]] receives 95 percent of all goods destined for Alaska. Ships from Totem Ocean Trailer Express and Horizon Lines arrive twice weekly from the [[Port of Tacoma]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Along with handling these activities, the port is a storage facility for jet fuel from Alaskan refineries, which is used at both TSAIA and [[Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson]] (JBER).

The existing port was substantially built in the late 1950s and is reaching the end of its useful life. Beginning in 2017, the Port of Anchorage is undertaking an extensive 7-year Anchorage Port Modernization Project<ref>{{cite web |title=Anchorage Port Modernization Project |url=http://www.portofanc.com/modernization-project/ |website=portofanc.com |access-date=January 21, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316172958/http://www.portofanc.com/modernization-project/ |archive-date=March 16, 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref> to upgrade its aging infrastructure, support larger deeper draft vessels, and future proof the port seismically and environmentally for another 75 years.

The United States military has two large installations, [[Elmendorf Air Force Base]] and [[Fort Richardson (Alaska)|Fort Richardson]], which originally stemmed from the branching off of the [[U.S. Air Force]] from the [[U.S. Army]] following World War II. In a cost-cutting effort initiated by the [[Base Realignment and Closure, 2005|2005 BRAC proceedings]], the bases were combined. JBER was created, which also incorporated [[Kulis Air National Guard Base]] near TSAIA. The combination of these three bases employ approximately 8,500 civilian and military personnel. These individuals along with their families comprise approximately ten percent of the local population. During the [[Cold War]], Elmendorf became an important base due to its proximity to the [[Soviet Union]], particularly as a [[Alaskan Air Command|command center]] for numerous forward air stations established throughout the western reaches of Alaska (most of which have since closed).

While [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]] is the official state capital of Alaska, more state employees reside in the Anchorage area. Approximately 6,800 state employees work in Anchorage compared to about 3,800 in Juneau. The State of Alaska purchased the [[Bank of America]] Center (which it renamed the [[Robert B. Atwood Building]]) to house most of its offices, after several decades of leasing space in the McKay Building (now the [[McKinley Tower]]) and later the Frontier Building.

The resource sector, mainly petroleum, is arguably Anchorage's most visible industry, with many high-rise buildings bearing the logos of large multinationals such as [[Hilcorp]] and [[ConocoPhillips]]. While field operations are centered on the [[Alaska North Slope]] and south of Anchorage around [[Cook Inlet]], the majority of offices and administration are found in Anchorage. The headquarters building of [[ConocoPhillips Alaska]], a subsidiary of [[ConocoPhillips]], is in downtown Anchorage.<ref>"[http://www.conocophillipsalaska.com/permits/Grandview%20and%20Pioneer%20Permit%20apps/Surface%20Use%20Plan.pdf North Slope National Petroleum Reserva Alaska 2008/2009 Exploration Drilling Program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919092544/http://conocophillipsalaska.com/permits/Grandview%20and%20Pioneer%20Permit%20apps/Surface%20Use%20Plan.pdf |date=September 19, 2010 }}."

Anchorage is governed by an elected mayor and 11-member [[city council|assembly]], with the assistance of a [[city manager]]. These positions are nonpartisan (as are all municipal elected offices in Alaska): no candidates officially run under any party banner. All 11 members are elected from districts known as sections. Five of the sections elect two members from designated seats, while the remaining section elects one member. Before the [[1980 United States Census]], the single-member section was the one centered around the northern Anchorage communities of [[Chugiak]] and [[Eagle River (Anchorage)|Eagle River]]. Since then, the area encompassing [[Downtown Anchorage]] and surrounding neighborhoods has served as the city's single-member section. The mayor (along with members of the school board) is elected in a citywide vote. In practice, major candidates' party affiliation and political ideology are usually well known and highlighted by local media for the purpose of framing debate. The city's mayor is [[Suzanne LaFrance]]. Along with seven sister cities in the SCI program{{clarify|date=January 2017}}, Anchorage has a cultural exchange program with [[Montenegro]].

In the 2017 municipal election, Christopher Constant and Felix Rivera became the first openly gay candidates elected to Anchorage public office.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gay-candidates-win-alaska-election_us_58e53b55e4b06a4cb30e9ed9] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406174916/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gay-candidates-win-alaska-election_us_58e53b55e4b06a4cb30e9ed9|date=April 6, 2017}} ''HuffPost'', "Two Openly Gay Candidates Notch Historic Wins in Alaska Election".

Anchorage generally leans toward [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates in both state and presidential elections. But since the establishment of the municipality in 1975, there have been two [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] mayors ([[Tony Knowles (politician)|Tony Knowles]] and [[Mark Begich]]), each of whom was elected to two consecutive terms and later to statewide office. [[Downtown Anchorage|Downtown]], [[Girdwood, Anchorage|Girdwood]], and much of both the west and east parts of town trend Democratic. Areas closest to the military bases, including [[Eagle River, Alaska|Eagle River]], and south Anchorage are the municipality's most Republican areas. Midtown is relatively moderate. In [[2020 United States presidential election in Alaska|2020]], [[Joe Biden]] became the first Democrat to win Anchorage since [[Lyndon Johnson]] in [[1964 United States presidential election in Alaska|1964]].

Voting trends show that Downtown Anchorage votes Democratic in large margins, while [[Spenard, Anchorage|Spenard]], Turnagain/Inlet View, and University/Airport Heights are relatively moderate and swing in elections. The remaining Anchorage areas have traditionally trended Republican.<ref>{{cite web |title=2008 Presidential Election Results by House District in Alaska |publisher=USA Election Atlas |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/FORUM/index.php?topic=88046.0 |access-date=July 5, 2010}}</ref> In 2018, Anchorage began conducting municipal elections by mail (as directed by the assembly in 2015) and had the highest voter turnout in the city's history.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kelly |first1=Devin |title=Anchorage's vote-by-mail election was supposed to boost turnout.

Anchorage-Eagle River sends 16 representatives ({{as of|2018|lc=y}}, nine Republicans and seven Democrats) to the 40-member [[Alaska House of Representatives]] and eight senators (five Republicans and three Democrats) to the 20-member Senate. When seats from the neighboring [[Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska|Mat-Su Borough]] are added, more than half the Alaska state legislature comes from the [[Anchorage metropolitan area]]. This is often used as an argument for moving the state capital from [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]] to the Anchorage area.

As the territory grew during the following decades, so did efforts to provide care. Hospitals were opened in [[Fairbanks]] in 1910 and Anchorage in 1937.

Alaska Regional Hospital on DeBarr Road opened in 1958 as Anchorage Presbyterian Hospital, downtown at 825 L Street. This predecessor to Alaska Regional was a joint venture between local physicians and the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterian Church]]. In 1976 the hospital moved to its present location on DeBarr Road, and is now a 254-bed licensed and accredited facility. Alaska Regional has expanded services and in 1994, Alaska Regional joined with [[Hospital Corporation of America|HCA]], one of the nation's largest healthcare providers.

[[Alaska Native Medical Center]] on Tudor Road provides medical care and therapeutic health care to [[Alaska native]]s—229 tribes—at the Anchorage site and at 15 satellite facilities throughout the state. ANMC specialists also travel to clinics in the [[Bush Alaska|bush]] to provide care. The 150-bed hospital is also a teaching center for the [[University of Washington]]'s regional medical education program. ANMC houses an office of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]. The [[Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium]] and Southcentral Foundation jointly own and manage ANMC.

Electric power in the Anchorage area is provided by Chugach Electric Association, a nonprofit, member-owned cooperative founded in 1948. From 1932 to 2020, the Municipality of Anchorage operated its own electric utility, Municipal Light & Power (ML&P). Historically, ML&P served the older, more urbanized regions of the city, while Chugach served newer areas of town, suburbs, and rural areas. Chugach acquired ML&P in 2020, with the sale finalized in October.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chugach Electric Association |title=Chugach Electric completes ML&P acquisition |url=https://www.chugachelectric.com/media/press-releases/2020/10/30/chugach-electric-completes-mlp-acquisition |website=Chugach Electric Association |access-date=19 December 2021 |archive-date=December 19, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211219005355/https://www.chugachelectric.com/media/press-releases/2020/10/30/chugach-electric-completes-mlp-acquisition |url-status=live }}</ref> Post-acquisition, the Chugach cooperative had over 92,000 members.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chugach Electric Association |title=Annual Report 2020 |url=https://www.chugachelectric.com/system/files/annual_reports/2020%20Annual%20Report.pdf |website=Chugach Electric Association |access-date=December 19, 2021 |archive-date=December 19, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211219005400/https://www.chugachelectric.com/system/files/annual_reports/2020%20Annual%20Report.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

Most homes have natural gas-fueled heat. [[AltaGas|ENSTAR Natural Gas Company]] is the sole provider for Anchorage, servicing some 90-percent of the city's population.

The Municipality of Anchorage owns and operates the Anchorage Water and Wastewater Utility, serving some 55,000 customer accounts with water from [[Eklutna Lake]], which is mainly meltwater from [[Eklutna Glacier]]. Anchorage Municipal Solid Waste Services and Anchorage Refuse conduct trash removal in the city depending on location.

==Transportation==

===Major highways===
*{{jct|state=AK|AK|1}} passing through downtown Anchorage 
*{{jct|state=AK|AK|3}} branching off from AK-1 in [[Gateway, Alaska|Gateway]], 35 miles northeast of Anchorage city

Alaskans do not use numerical route designations in everyday discourse, preferring the named designations—in this case the Seward Highway (for AK-1 south of the city), the Glenn Highway (for AK-1 northeast of the city), and the Parks Highway (for AK-3).

====Highway to Highway====
{{Main|Seward Highway to Glenn Highway Connection}}
On and off since the 1960s, the [[Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities]], in coordination with the [[Federal Highway Administration]] and the Municipality of Anchorage (or the lineal predecessors of those entities), have been exploring the concept of a roadway connecting the endpoints of the Seward and Glenn highways. The project is called "Highway to Highway", and the most recent concept for this project is that of a "trenched" freeway through the heart of Anchorage.

Highway to Highway was included in the 2005 Long Range Transportation Plan, and would cost at least $575 million (${{Inflation|US-GDP|575|2005}} million in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} dollars).{{Inflation-fn|US-GDP}} – by far the largest urban infrastructure project in Alaska's history.

===Public transit===
{{Main|People Mover (Anchorage)}}
Anchorage has a [[public transit|bus system]] called People Mover,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.muni.org/transit |title=Muni.org |publisher=Muni.org |access-date=January 29, 2012 |archive-date=April 13, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220413132925/https://www.muni.org/departments/transit/peoplemover/Pages/default.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref> with a hub downtown and satellite hubs at [[Dimond Center]] and Muldoon Mall. The [[People Mover (Anchorage)|People Mover]] provides carpool organization services.

The [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport]], {{cvt|6|mi|km}} south of [[downtown Anchorage]], is the airline hub for the state, served by many national and international airlines, including Seattle-based [[Alaska Airlines]] as well as many intrastate airlines and charter air services. The airport is the primary international air freight gateway in the nation. By weight, five percent of the value of all United States international air cargo moved through Anchorage in 2008.<ref>[http://www.bts.gov/publications/americas_freight_transportation_gateways/2009/highlights_of_top_25_freight_gateways_by_shipment_value/anchorage/index.html Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, Alaska—Air Freight Gateway] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915153056/http://www.bts.gov/publications/americas_freight_transportation_gateways/2009/highlights_of_top_25_freight_gateways_by_shipment_value/anchorage/index.html |date=September 15, 2012 }} Bureau of Transportation Statistics.
