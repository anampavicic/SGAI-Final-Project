'''Sibiu County''' ({{IPA|ro|siˈbiw}}) is a county ({{langx|ro|[[județ]]}}) of [[Romania]], in the historical region of [[Transylvania]]. Its county seat ({{langx|ro|reședință de județ}}) is the namesake town of [[Sibiu]] ({{langx|de|Hermannstadt}}).

== Name ==

In Hungarian, it is known as ''Szeben megye'', and in German as ''Kreis Hermannstadt''. Under the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], a county with an identical name ([[Szeben County]], {{langx|ro|Comitatul Sibiu}}) was created in 1876.

== Demographics ==

[[File:SibiuHermannstadtSchild.jpg|thumb|right|[[Romanian language|Romanian]]-[[German language|German]] bilingual sign at the entrance in Sibiu ({{langx|de|Hermannstadt}})]]
[[File:Michelsberg Ortsschild 2016.jpg|thumb|[[Romanian language|Romanian]]-[[German language|German]] bilingual sign at the entrance in Cisnădioara ({{langx|de|Michelsberg}})]]
[[File:Heltau-Ortsschild 2016.JPG|thumb|[[Romanian language|Romanian]]-[[German language|German]] bilingual sign at the entrance in Cisnădie ({{langx|de|Heltau}})]]

In 2011, Sibiu County had a population of 397,322 and the [[population density]] was {{Pop density|397322|5432|km2|sqmi|prec=1}}.

At the [[2011 Romanian census|2011 census]], the county has the following population indices:

* [[Romanians]] – 91.25% (or 340,836)<ref>National Institute of Statistics, ''[http://www.recensamant.ro/pagini/tabele/t40a.pdf "Populația după etnie"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816034908/http://www.recensamant.ro/pagini/tabele/t40a.pdf |date=2009-08-16 }}''</ref>
* [[Romani people in Romania|Romani]] – 4.76% (or 17,901)
* [[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarians]] – 2.89% (or 10,893)
* [[Germans of Romania|Germans]] <small>([[Transylvanian Saxons]])</small> – 1.09% (or 4,117)
* [[Minorities of Romania|Other]] – 0.1% (or 640)

At the [[2021 Romanian census|2021 census]], the county has the following population indices:

* [[Romanians]] – 93.36% (or 313,118)
* [[Romani people in Romania|Romani]] – 3.82% (or 12,808)
* [[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarians]] – 1.82% (or 6,112)
* [[Germans of Romania|Germans]] <small>([[Transylvanian Saxons]])</small> – 0.81% (or 2,716)
* [[Minorities of Romania|Other]] – 0.19% (or 641)

Religion:

* [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] – 90.9%
* [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek Catholic]]s – 2.3%
* [[Reformed Church in Romania|Reformed]] – 2.0%
* [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]s – 1.5%
* [[Pentecostal Union of Romania|Pentecostals]] – 1.1%
* [[Baptists]] – 0.9%
* Other – 1.3%

Urbanisation – 5th most urbanised county in Romania:

* Urban dwellers: 277,574 (or 65.8%)
* Rural dwellers: 144,150 (or 34.2%)

Traditionally, the biggest minority in the county were Germans, but their numbers have decreased since World War II and especially after the [[Romanian Revolution]] of 1989.

The south side of the county, closer to the mountains was mainly inhabited by Romanians ([[Mărginimea Sibiului]]), and the north side of the country (the [[Transylvanian Plateau]]) was inhabited evenly by Germans and Romanians, but most [[Saxons|Saxon]] villages are now deserted by their original ethnic German population. The Roma population, mainly from southern Romania, was placed close to the villages in the [[Socialist Republic of Romania|communist period]] and have since increased their numbers, especially in the [[Hârtibaciu]] valley.

Most of the population is concentrated in the Sibiu metropolitan area which has over 240 thousand inhabitants, with settlements like [[Șelimbăr]], [[Cisnădie]] (especially the Arhitecților neighbourhood), [[Șura Mare]], [[Șura Mică]], [[Cristian, Sibiu|Cristian]], and [[Roșia, Sibiu|Roșia]] having grown in population in the last 15 years, both from internal migration from the county and from other areas, mainly [[Vâlcea County]]. [[Tălmaciu]] and [[Avrig]] are other towns in the area.

Another population centre is the second largest city, Mediaș, with almost 40 thousand inhabitants, which forms a relatively higher population density area than the surrounding northern part of the county, with the nearby towns of Copșa Mică and Dumbrăveni and also communes like Bazna or Târnava.

== Geography ==

This county has a total area of {{cvt|5432|km2}}.

In the South side there are the [[Carpathian Mountains]] ([[Southern Carpathians]]) – the [[Făgăraș Mountains]] with heights over {{cvt|2500|m}}, the [[Lotru Mountains]], and the [[Cindrel Mountains]] – which make up to 30% of the county's surface. The [[Olt (river)|Olt River]] crosses the mountains over to the South of Romania in Sibiu County, forming one of the most accessible links between [[Transylvania]] and [[Wallachia]]. In the North side there is the [[Transylvanian Plateau]].

The most important rivers crossing the county are the Olt in the South with the [[Cibin]] as its main effluent, and the [[Târnava]] in the North.

== Economy ==

Sibiu County has one of the most dynamic economies in Romania, and is one of the regions with the highest level of foreign investment.

The predominant industries in the county are:
* Machine and automotive components
* Food industry
* Textile industry
* Wood industry

The biggest natural resource in the county is [[natural gas]], especially in the north side, having one of the largest sources in the country.

In [[Copșa Mică]] during the communist period there were [[Copșa Mică works|two chemical industrial complexes]] which polluted the environment heavily with [[carbon black]], heavy metals, and other chemical substances. The area is still considered one of the most polluted communities in Europe. After 1989 many of the industrial complexes were shut down and the area is slowly recovering.

== Politics ==

The regional legislature is the County Council. Its president was Martin Bottesch ([[Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania|FDGR/DFDR]]) from 2004 to 2012. The Sibiu County Council, renewed at the [[2020 Romanian local elections|2020 local elections]], consists of 32 counsellors, with the following party composition:<ref>{{Cite web|language=ro|url=https://prezenta.roaep.ro/locale27092020/data/json/sicpv/pv/pv_vs_final.json|format=Json|title=Rezultatele finale ale alegerilor locale din 2020|publisher=Autoritatea Electorală Permanentă|accessdate=2020-11-02}}</ref>

Historically, the county was located in the central part of [[Greater Romania]], in the southern part of the historical region of Transylvania. The capital was Sibiu.

The interwar county's territory included most of the southwestern portion of today's Sibiu County, excluding the area around [[Ocna Sibiului|Vizocna]] that belonged to former Hungarian subdivision of [[Alsó-Fehér County]], and the communes of [[Agârbiciu, Sibiu|Agârbiciu]], [[Buia, Sibiu|Buia]], [[Axente Sever, Sibiu|Frâua]], [[Hașag, Sibiu|Hașag]], [[Șeica Mare]], and [[Șeica Mică]], which all belonged to [[Târnava Mare County]]. Sibiu County once contained the district around [[Sebeș]], which passed in 1925 to Alba County.

It was bordered to the west by the counties of [[Hunedoara County|Hunedoara]] and Alba, to the north by the counties of [[Târnava-Mică County|Târnava-Mică]] and Târnava Mare, to the east by [[Făgăraș County]], and to the south by the counties of [[Gorj County|Gorj]] and [[Vâlcea County|Vâlcea]].

=== Administration ===

[[File:1938 map of interwar county Sibiu.jpg|thumb|right|310px|Map of Sibiu County as constituted in 1938.]]

The county originally consisted of the city of [[Sibiu]] and four districts (''[[plasă|plăși]]''):<ref name=Memoria>[http://romaniainterbelica.memoria.ro/judete/sibiu/ Portretul României Interbelice - Județul Sibiu]</ref>

#Plasa Ocna Sibiului, headquartered at Ocna Sibiului
#Plasa Săliște, headquartered at [[Săliște]]
#Plasa Sibiu, headquartered at Sibiu

A subsequent administrative division in 1937 had the county divided into the city of Sibiu and six districts:
#Plasa Avrig, headquartered at [[Avrig]]
#Plasa Mercurea, headquartered at Mercurea
#Plasa Nocrich, headquartered at [[Nocrich, Sibiu|Nocrich]]
#Plasa Ocna Sibiului, headquartered at Ocna Sibiului
#Plasa Săliște, headquartered at Săliște
#Plasa Sibiu, headquartered at Sibiu
