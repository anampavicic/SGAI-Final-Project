== History ==
{{Main|History of Gyeongju}}The early history of Gyeongju is closely tied to that of the [[Silla]] kingdom, of which it was the capital. Gyeongju first enters non-Korean records as [[Saro-guk]], during the [[Samhan]] period in the early [[Common Era]].<ref name="EncyKorea History" /> Korean records, probably based on the dynastic chronicles of Silla, record that Saro-guk was established in 57 BCE, when six small villages in the Gyeongju area united under [[Bak Hyeokgeose of Silla|Bak Hyeokgeose]]. As the kingdom expanded, it changed its name to Silla.<ref name="EncyKorea Silla">{{cite web|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=284393&v=42 |script-title=ko:신라 (新羅) |trans-title=Silla |publisher=Nate / Encyclopedia of Korean Culture |language=ko |access-date=2009-08-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610054427/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=284393&v=42 |archive-date=2011-06-10 }}</ref> During the Silla period, the city was called "Seorabeol" (this toponym would eventually evolve into a Korean word for "capital city" as in [[Seoul]]),<ref name="EncyKorea History">{{cite web|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=&i=3008022 |script-title=ko:경주시의 역사 |trans-title=History of Gyeongju |publisher=Nate / Encyclopedia of Korean Culture |language=ko |access-date=2009-08-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610054335/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=&i=3008022 |archive-date=2011-06-10 }}</ref> "Gyerim" (lit.

Gyeongju lies in the southeastern corner of North Gyeongsang Province, and is bounded by the metropolitan city of [[Ulsan]] on the south. Within the province, its neighbors include [[Pohang]] on the north, [[Cheongdo County]] on the southwest, and [[Yeongcheon]] on the northwest.<ref name="EncyKorea Gyeongju 1" /> Gyeongju is located about {{convert|50|km|mi|sp=us}} north of [[Busan]].<ref name="Xinhua" /> To the east, it has no neighbor but the sea.<ref name="EncyKorea Gyeongju 1" />

===Climate===
Gyeongju has a cooler version of a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa''). Due to its coastal location, Gyeongju has a slightly milder climate than the more inland regions of Korea. In general, however, the city's climate is typical of South Korea. It has hot summers and cool winters, with a [[monsoon]] season between late June and early August. As on the rest of Korea's east coast, autumn [[typhoon]]s are not uncommon. The average annual rainfall is {{convert|1091|mm|in|sp=us|1}}, and the average annual high temperatures range from {{convert|8.6|-|31.1|°C|°F|0}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gyeongju.go.kr/inFrame.asp?how_chk=&hdnPage=&Kwa01Code=&s_sy=&s_sm=&s_ey=&s_em=&SearchType=&SearchString=&reqNum=&vDiscrNo=&name=&result=&discrHash=&PCODE=A0105&main=1&sub=5 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613162102/http://www.gyeongju.go.kr/inFrame.asp?how_chk=&hdnPage=&Kwa01Code=&s_sy=&s_sm=&s_ey=&s_em=&SearchType=&SearchString=&reqNum=&vDiscrNo=&name=&result=&discrHash=&PCODE=A0105&main=1&sub=5 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-06-13 |publisher=Gyeongju City website|script-title=ko:위치와 자연지리 |trans-title=Location and geography |access-date=2009-07-13 |language=ko}}</ref>

Gyeongju's historic city center lies on the banks of the Hyeongsan in Gyeongju Basin. This lowlying area has been subject to repeated [[flood]]ing throughout recorded history, often as a result of typhoons. On average, chronicles report a major flood every 27.9 years, beginning in the 1st century.<ref>Kang (2002), p. 6.</ref> Modern flood control mechanisms brought about a dramatic reduction in flooding in the later 20th century. The last major flood occurred in 1991, when the Deokdong Lake reservoir overflowed due to [[1991 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Gladys|Typhoon Gladys]].<ref>Kang (2002), p. 5.</ref>

Most subdivisions of Gyeongju elect a single member to represent them in the council, but [[Angang-eup]] is represented by two members because of its large population, and two of the representatives serve combined districts composed of two ''dong''. Like the mayor, the council members were last elected in 2006, except for a small number elected in more recent [[by-election]]s.

The central administration is composed of a City Council committee, five departments, two subsidiary organs, a chamber (the auditor), and six business offices. The five departments are the departments of  Planning and Culture, Autonomous Administration, Industry and Environment, Construction and Public Works, and the National Enterprise Committee; these oversee a total of 29 subdivisions. The two subsidiary organs are the Health Care Center and Agro-technology Center; these belong directly to the central administration and have a total of 4 subdivisions. In addition, there are 23 local administrative subdivisions. Each of these subdivisions has a local office with a small administrative staff.<ref>{{cite web|date=2009-05-12 |url=http://www.gyeongju.go.kr/inFrame.asp?how_chk=&hdnPage=&Kwa01Code=&s_sy=&s_sm=&s_ey=&s_em=&SearchType=&SearchString=&reqNum=&vDiscrNo=&name=&result=&discrHash=&PCODE=A0201&main=2&sub=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613163325/http://www.gyeongju.go.kr/inFrame.asp?how_chk=&hdnPage=&Kwa01Code=&s_sy=&s_sm=&s_ey=&s_em=&SearchType=&SearchString=&reqNum=&vDiscrNo=&name=&result=&discrHash=&PCODE=A0201&main=2&sub=1 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-06-13 |script-title=ko:행정조직 |trans-title=Administrative organization |publisher=Gyeongju City |language=ko |access-date=2009-09-15}}</ref> As of December 2008, the city government employed 1,462 people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ebook.gyeongju.go.kr/data/2009bef_pdf.zip |script-title=ko:기본현황 |trans-title=Basic status quo |publisher=Gyeongju City |page=7 |language=ko |access-date=2009-09-15 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

{{Main|Subdivisions of Gyeongju}}

The ''dong'' or neighborhood units occupy the area of the city center, which was formerly occupied by Gyeongju-eup. ''Eup'' are typically substantial villages, whereas ''myeon'' are more rural.<ref name="2008 Tonggye 2" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gyeongju.go.kr/inboard.asp?PCODE=A0105_01&main=1&sub=2&cor=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613162218/http://www.gyeongju.go.kr/inboard.asp?PCODE=A0105_01&main=1&sub=2&cor=1 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-06-13 |script-title=ko:행정구역 |trans-title=Administrative divisions |date=2007-12-31 |access-date=2009-09-16 |publisher=Gyeongju City |language=ko}} <br /></ref>

The city's boundaries and designation changed several times in the 20th century. From 1895 to 1955, the area was known as Gyeongju-gun ("Gyeongju County"). In the first decades of the century, the city center was known as Gyeongju-myeon, signifying a relatively rural rea. In 1931, the downtown area was designated Gyeongju-eup, in recognition of its increasingly urban nature. In 1955, Gyeongju-eup became Gyeongju-si ("Gyeongju City"), the same name as today, but with a much smaller area. The remainder of Gyeongju-gun became "Wolseong County." The county and city were reunited in 1995, creating Gyeongju City as it is today.<ref name="EncyKorea History" />

==Demographics==
When the Silla kingdom reached the peak of its development, Gyeongju was estimated to have a million residents, four times the city's population in 2008.<ref name="EncyKorea Gyeongju 1" /><ref name="Breen 82" /> In recent years, Gyeongju has followed the same trends that have affected the rest of South Korea. Like the country as a whole, Gyeongju has seen its population age and the size of families shrink. For instance, the mean household size is 2.8 people. Because this has fallen in recent years, there are more households in the city as of 2008 (105,009) than there were in 2003, even though the population has fallen.<ref name="gyeongju2">{{cite web|url=http://www.gyeongju.go.kr//upload/board/2118/2013/1//20130124100421_1.pdf|title=2013 Statistical Report Gyeongju|publisher=Gyeongju City}}</ref>

Like most of South Korea's smaller cities, Gyeongju has seen a steady drop in population in recent years. From 2002 to 2008, the city lost 16,557 people.<ref name="status quo">{{cite web|url=http://gyeongju.go.kr/inFrame.asp?how_chk=&hdnPage=&Kwa01Code=&s_sy=&s_sm=&s_ey=&s_em=&SearchType=&SearchString=&reqNum=&vDiscrNo=&name=&result=&discrHash=&PCODE=A0106&main=1&sub=6 |script-title=ko:인구현황|trans-title=Status-quo of the population|publisher=Gyeongju City|access-date=2009-08-02}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> This is primarily due to the migration of workers seeking employment in the major South Korean cities. In 2007, about 1,975 more people moved away from the city each year than moved in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gyeongju.go.kr/administrative/administrative/tonggye2008/3.pdf |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5ikHjRyuP?url=http://gyeongju.go.kr/administrative/administrative/tonggye2008/3.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-08-03 |title=11.

Gyeongju has a small but growing population of non-Koreans. In 2007, there were 4,671 foreigners living in Gyeongju. This number corresponds to 1.73% of the total population, more than double the figure from 2003. The growth was largely in immigrants from other Asian countries, many of whom are employed in the automotive parts industry. Countries of origin whose numbers have risen include the [[Philippines]], China, [[Taiwan]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Vietnam]]. The number of residents from Japan, the United States, and Canada fell significantly in the 2003–2007 period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gyeongju.go.kr/administrative/administrative/tonggye2008/3.pdf |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5ikHjRyuP?url=http://gyeongju.go.kr/administrative/administrative/tonggye2008/3.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-08-03 |title=Registered Foreigners by Major Nationality |publisher=Gyeongju City |access-date=2009-08-02 |work=Statistical yearbook of Gyeongju 2008 |page=109 }}</ref>

===Dialect===
The city has a distinctive [[dialect]] which it shares with northern portions of [[Ulsan]]. This dialect is similar to the general [[Gyeongsang dialect]], but retains distinctive features of its own. Some linguists have treated the distinctive characteristics of the Gyeongju dialect as vestiges of the [[Silla language]]. For instance, the contrast between the local dialect form "{{lang|ko|소내기}}" (''sonaegi'') and the standard "{{lang|ko|[[wikt:소나기|소나기]]}}" (''sonagi,'' meaning "rainshower") has been seen as reflecting the ancient [[phoneme|phonemic]] character of the Silla language.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Yi, Seong-gyu|year=2003 |script-title=ko:문학 작품에 나타난 방언 |trans-title=Dialect appearing in literary works (''Munhak jakpum-e natanan bang-eon.'') |journal=SAE Gugeo Saenghwal (New Living Korean Language) |issue=4 |url=http://www.korean.go.kr/nkview/nklife/2003_4/13_3.html |access-date=2009-09-15 |language=ko |volume=13}}</ref>

===Religion===
The city remains an important centre of [[Korean Buddhism]]. East of the downtown area lies [[Bulguksa]], one of South Korea's largest Buddhist temples; nearby is [[Seokguram]], a famed Buddhist shrine. Traditional prayer locations are found on mountains throughout Gyeongju. Such mountains include [[Namsan (Gyeongju)|Namsan]] near the city center,<ref>Robinson et al. 2007. p.204</ref> Danseok-san and Obong-san in the west, and the low peak of Hyeong-san on the Gyeongju-Pohang border.<ref>Kim, 2003, pp. 136–152.</ref> Namsan in particular is often referred to as "the sacred mountain" due to the Buddhist shrines and statues which cover its slopes.<ref>For example, in the ''Handbook of Korea'' 11th ed., p. 656, and in {{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/archive/repcom00.htm#976|title=World Heritage Committee twenty-fourth session|work=UNESCO WHC Archive|date=2005-07-09 |access-date=2009-09-15}}</ref> In addition, Gyeongju is the birthplace of [[Cheondoism]], an indigenous religion to Korea based on [[Korean shamanism]], [[Taoism]] and Korean Buddhism, with elements drawn from [[Christianity]]. The religion evolved from [[Donghak]] (lit. East learning) disciplines established by [[Choe Je-u]].

Agriculture is still important, particularly in the outlying regions of Gyeongju. According to the 2006 statistical yearbook of Gyeongju, rice fields occupy an area of {{convert|169.57|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, which is 70% of the total cultivated acreage of {{convert|24359|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The remaining {{convert|74.02|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} consists of fields under other crops and farmsteads. Crop production is centered in the fertile river basins near the [[Hyeongsan River]]. The main crops are rice, barley, beans and corn. Vegetables such as [[radish]] and [[napa cabbage]] and fruits are also important crops. Apples are mainly produced in the districts of [[Geoncheon-eup]], [[Gangdong-myeon, Gyeongju|Gangdong-myeon]] and [[Cheonbuk-myeon, Gyeongju|Cheonbuk-myeon]] and [[Korean pear]] are cultivated in Geoncheon-eup and [[Angang-eup]].

As the capital of Silla, commerce and trading in Gyeongju developed early on. ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'' has records on the establishment of ''Gyeongdosi'' (capital area market) in March, 490 during [[Soji of Silla|King Soji]]'s reign, and ''Dongsi'' (East Market) in 509, during [[Jijeung of Silla|King Jijeung]]'s reign. In the 1830s, Gyeongju had five five-day markets which remained very active until the late 1920s. Due to its size ''Gyeongju Bunaejang'' (Gyeongju village market) was referred to as one of the two leading markets in the [[Yeongnam]] area, along with ''[[Daegu]] Bunaejang''. Transportation developed in the late period of the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]], as the [[Jungang Line]] and the [[Daegu Line]] and the connecting route between [[Pohang]] and the northwestern part of Japan were set up, leading to increasing population and developing commerce. After the 1960s, traditional periodic markets gradually transformed into regular markets as the city was flourishing. In periodic markets, agricultural and marine products, industrial products, living necessaries, wild edible greens, herbs, and cattle are mainly traded. As of 2006, Gyeongju had eight regular markets, nine periodic markets and the Gyeongju department store. Traditional periodic markets declined and have become token affairs these days.<ref name="Industry" /><ref name="Brit Transport" />

Much of Gyeongju's heritage are related to the Silla kingdom's patronage of [[Buddhism]]. The grotto of [[Seokguram]] and the temple of [[Bulguksa]] were the first Korean sites to be included on the UNESCO [[World Heritage List]] in 1995.<ref name="Tourism" /><ref>Robinson et al. 2007. p.22</ref> In addition, the ruins of the old [[Hwangnyongsa]] temple, said to have been Korean's largest, are preserved on the slopes of [[Tohamsan|Toham Mountain]].

A significant portion of Gyeongju's tourist traffic is due to the city's promotion of itself as a site for various festivals, conferences, and competitions.

Gyeongju's emerging tourist attraction is the Hwangnidan-gil. The address of Hwangnidan-gil is 1080, Poseok-ro, Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province. There are about 80 stores, including restaurants, cafes, bookstores, and gift shops. Hwangnidan-gil became popular through social networking sites, and neighboring Gyeongju's historical site is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The advantage of the Hwangnidan-gil is the result of voluntary efforts by merchants without help from local governments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news20.busan.com/controller/newsController.jsp?newsId=20180131000269 |script-title=ko:[새로 보기 : 황리단길] 80여 식당·카페·서점 즐비한 포석로... 유행과 개성 넘쳐나는 경주의 '현재'|last=윤 |first=현주}}</ref>

== Education ==
{{see also|Education in South Korea}}

Gyeongju is strongly associated with the education tradition of [[Hwarangdo]] ("Way of the Flower of Young Men") which was established and flourished during the Silla period. It is a military and philosophical code that offered the basis of training to [[Hwarang]], a military cadet of youths from the aristocratic class. The training equally emphasized practicing academic and martial arts based on Buddhism and patriotism. A number of Silla's greatest generals and military leaders such as [[Kim Yu-sin]] were Hwarang who played a central role in Silla unification of the Korean peninsula. As Silla was integrated into the next ruling dynasty, [[Goryeo]], the system declined and was officially disbanded in the [[Joseon dynasty]]. However, the spirit and discipline were revived in the second half of the 20th century as a form of Korean martial arts with the same name.<ref>Doniger, Wendy (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=IDsk47MeksAC&pg=PA482 Britannica Encyclopedia of World Religions] Encyclopædia Britannica, {{ISBN|1-59339-491-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?masterno=172671&contentno=172671 |script-title=ko:화랑도 花郞徒 |trans-title=Hwarangdo |publisher=[[Doosan Encyclopedia]] |language=ko |access-date=2009-09-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050103022341/http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?masterno=172671&contentno=172671 |archive-date=2005-01-03 }}</ref>

Formal education has a longer history in Gyeongju than anywhere else in South Korea. The ''[[Gukhak]]'', or national academy, was established here in 682, at the beginning of the [[Unified Silla]] period.<ref name="Gyeongju City">{{cite web|url=http://eguide.gj.go.kr/detail_view/Detail_view.jsp?cid=8283&tab=1 |title=''Gyeongju Hyanggyo (a local school annexed to the Confucian shrine)'' |publisher=Gyeongju City-Transportation System |access-date=2009-08-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722140259/http://eguide.gj.go.kr/detail_view/Detail_view.jsp?cid=8283&tab=1 |archive-date=2011-07-22 }}</ref> Its curriculum focused on the Confucian classics for local officials.<ref name="Robinson et al. 2007. p.28"/> After the fall of [[Silla]] in the 10th century, the [[Gukhak]] closed. However, due to Gyeongju's role as a provincial center under the [[Goryeo]] and early [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] dynasties, the city was home to state-sponsored provincial schools (''[[hyanggyo]]'') under both dynasties such as [[Gyeongju Hyanggyo]]. During the later Joseon dynasty there were several [[seowon]], or private Confucian academies, were set up in the city such as [[Oksan Seowon, Gyeongju|Oksan Seowon]] and [[Seoak Seowon]].<ref name="Education">{{cite web|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=&i=3008024 |script-title=ko:경주시의 교육·문화 |trans-title=Education and culture of Gyeongju |publisher=Nate / Encyclopedia of Korean Culture |language=ko |access-date=2009-08-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610055533/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=&i=3008024 |archive-date=2011-06-10 }}</ref>

The education system of Gyeongju is the same as elsewhere in the country. Schooling begins with [[preschool]]s; there are 65 in the city. This is followed by six years in [[elementary school]]s; Gyeongju has 46. Subsequently, students pass through three years of [[middle school]]. There are 19 middle schools in Gyeongju. High school education, which lasts for three years, is not [[compulsory education|compulsory]], but most students attend and graduate from high school. Gyeongju is home to 21 high schools,<ref name="Education" /> of which 11 provide specialized technical training. At each of these levels, there is a mix of public and private institutions.
