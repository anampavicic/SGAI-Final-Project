The '''Atacama Region''' ({{langx|es|Región de Atacama}}, {{IPA|es|ataˈkama|pron}}) is one of [[Chile]]'s 16 first order [[administrative division]]s. It comprises three [[Provinces of Chile|provinces]]: [[Chañaral Province|Chañaral]], [[Copiapó Province|Copiapó]] and [[Huasco Province|Huasco]]. It is bordered to the north by [[Antofagasta Region|Antofagasta]], to the south by [[Coquimbo Region|Coquimbo]], to the east by the provinces of [[Catamarca Province|Catamarca]], [[La Rioja Province (Argentina)|La Rioja]] and [[San Juan Province (Argentina)|San Juan]] of [[Argentina]], and to the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The regional capital [[Copiapó]] is located {{convert|806|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the country's capital of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. The region occupies the southern portion of the [[Atacama Desert]], the rest of the desert is mainly distributed among the other regions of [[Norte Grande, Chile|Norte Grande]].

==Demography==
The Atacama Region is the third least populated region of the country, after [[Aisén Region|Aysen]] and [[Magallanes and Antartica Chilena Region|Magallanes]]. Of its total population, over 50% are located in the cities of [[Copiapó]] and [[Vallenar]].

The largest cities are (2002 census data) [[Copiapó, Chile|Copiapó]] (125,983 inhabitants), [[Vallenar, Chile|Vallenar]] (43,750), [[Caldera, Chile|Caldera]] (12,776), [[Chañaral]] (12,086), [[El Salvador, Chile|El Salvador]] (8,697) [[Tierra Amarilla, Chile|Tierra Amarilla]] (8,578), and [[Diego de Almagro, Chile|Diego de Almagro]] (7,951).

==History==
{{See also|1420 Caldera earthquake|Chilean silver rush}}

The original inhabitants of this area, the [[Diaguitas]] and [[Changos]] valued its mineral wealth. Since the 19th century, iron, copper, silver, and gold have brought prosperity.

The region experienced a boom when the [[Chañarcillo]] silver mine was discovered in 1832.<ref>{{cite web| title = Los ciclos mineros del cobre y la plata (1820-1880)| url = http://www.memoriachilena.gob.cl/602/w3-article-727.html| website = www.memoriachilena.gob.cl| date = 2018| access-date = 9 April 2020}}</ref> For many years, this was the world's third largest silver mine.

==Natural features==
Much of the region is desert, and encompasses considerable mineral resources.<ref>Teresa Moreno and Wes Gibbons. 2007</ref> Numerous flora and fauna species are found in the Atacama Region. One [[subspecies]] of the [[lesser rhea]], known by the scientific name ''[[Rhea pennata]] tarapacensis'', is a notable large terrestrial bird in this region, which subspecies is considered [[endangered]]. The diminished numbers of this bird are due to prehistoric and modern hunting but more significantly due to agricultural land conversion in order to feed the [[Population growth|expanding human population]].

==Economy==
{{See also|Chilean Iron Belt|El Indio Gold Belt}}
Mining accounts for 45% of the region's GDP and 90% of its exports. Moreover, various geological surveys have identified new deposits.
[[Iron]] ore [[mining]] is the most dynamic activity and there are numerous small-scale mines, which sell their output to [[ENAMI (Chile)|ENAMI]] (the national mining company) for processing at its [[Paipote]] smelter. The region's main copper deposit is [[Candelaria, Chile|Candelaria]], which produces around 200,000 tonnes per year and is controlled by [[Phelps Dodge]], an international corporation. The next in size is El Salvador, owned by [[CODELCO]], with an annual output of around 81,000 tonnes. Both mines export through the port of [[Chañaral]].

Over recent decades, fresh [[fruit]] also emerged as regional export item, when the [[Copiapó Valley|Copiapó]] and [[Huasco, Chile|Huasco]] valleys joined [[Chile]]’s fruit-growing boom. They enjoy a comparative advantage because, thanks to the sunny climate, fruit ripens earlier than in the rest of the country and reaches northern hemisphere markets first.
Grapes are the main crop and, on a smaller scale, [[olive]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[capsicum|peppers]], [[onion]]s, [[Vicia faba|broad bean]]s, [[citrus]] fruits, [[nectarine]]s, [[apricot]]s, [[oregano]], and [[flower]]s.
The region's organic wealth, its clear waters and sheltered bays, together with its entrepreneurial experience, favor the development of aquaculture. Species produced include the northern scallop, Japanese and Chilean oysters, abalone, turbot, algae, and different varieties of mussels. Other products with more value added include boned fish fillets, smoked and salted fish, roe, and fishburgers.

The unique weather conditions in the [[Atacama Desert]], with extremely rare cloudy days, are ideal for solar power generation.<ref name=guardianSolar /> Many [[photovoltaics|PV]] and [[concentrated solar power|CSP]] plants are being built in this area.<ref name=guardianSolar>{{cite news|last1=Watts|first1=Jonathan|title=Desert tower raises Chile's solar power ambition to new heights|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/22/desert-tower-raises-chiles-solar-power-ambition-to-new-heights|access-date=13 March 2017|work=The Guardian|date=22 December 2015}}</ref>
