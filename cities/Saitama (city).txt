[[File:Saitama-City-Hall.jpg|right|thumb|Saitama City Hall]]

{{Nihongo|'''Saitama'''|さいたま市|Saitama-shi|extra={{IPA|ja|saꜜitama|pron}}}} is the capital and largest [[Cities of Japan|city]] of [[Saitama Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. Its area incorporates the former cities of [[Urawa, Saitama|Urawa]], [[Ōmiya, Saitama|Ōmiya]], [[Yono, Saitama|Yono]] and [[Iwatsuki, Saitama|Iwatsuki]]. It is a [[Cities designated by government ordinance of Japan|city designated by government ordinance]]. {{As of|2021|02|01}}, the city had an estimated population of 1,324,854, and a population density of 6,093 people per km² (15,781 people per mi²). Its total area is {{convert|217.43|sqkm|sqmi}}.<ref name="Saitama-hp">{{cite web |url=https://www.city.saitama.jp/006/013/005/001/p077762.html |title= Saitama city official statistics|location= Japan|language= ja}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name ''Saitama'' originally comes from the {{Nihongo|Sakitama District|埼玉郡}} of what is now the city of [[Gyoda, Saitama|Gyōda]] in the northern part of what is now known as Saitama Prefecture. ''Sakitama'' has an ancient history and is mentioned in the famous 8th century poetry anthology {{Lang|ja-latn|[[Man'yōshū]]}}. The pronunciation has changed from Sakitama to Saitama over the years.

With the merger of [[Urawa, Saitama|Urawa]], [[Ōmiya-ku, Saitama|Ōmiya]], and [[Yono, Saitama|Yono]] it was decided that a new name, one fitting for this newly created prefectural capital, was needed. The prefectural name {{Nihongo|"Saitama"|埼玉県}} was changed from ''[[kanji]]'' into ''[[hiragana]]'', thus {{Nihongo|Saitama City|さいたま市}} was born. It is the only prefectural capital in Japan whose name is always written in ''hiragana'', and belongs to the list of [[hiragana cities]].

However, Saitama written in ''hiragana'' ({{Nihongo2|さいたま市}}) actually finished in second place in public polling to Saitama written in ''kanji'' ({{Nihongo2|埼玉市}}). Despite this, government officials decided to name the new city Saitama in ''hiragana'', not ''kanji''. In third place in the poll was {{Nihongo|Ōmiya|大宮市}}. In fourth was {{Nihongo|Saitama|彩玉市}}, written with an alternative ''kanji'' for ''sai'' ({{Nihongo2|{{linktext|彩}}}}) which means "colorful". The ''sai'' ({{Nihongo2|{{linktext|埼}}}}) used in the prefectural name is a rare form of a common character ({{Nihongo2|崎}}) that means "[[Cape (geography)|cape]]" or "[[promontory]]".

== Geography ==
The city is located 20 to 30&nbsp;km north of central Tokyo, roughly at the center of the [[Kantō Plain]]. Situated in the southeast of Saitama Prefecture, the city is topographically comprised by lowlands and plateaus, at mostly less than 20 m above sea level, with no mountain ranges or hills within the city boundaries. The western portion of the city lies on the lowland created by the [[Arakawa River (Kanto)|Arakawa River]] along with those created by small rivers such as the [[Moto-Arakawa River]], [[Shiba River]], and [[Ayase River]]. The rest of the area mostly resides on the [[Ōmiya Plateau]] lying in the north-south direction. Dispersed in this region, major rivers flow southward, almost paralleling to one another.

== History ==
[[File:Changes of Saitama-City Area.png|thumb|400x400px|Pink: former Urawa<br>Blue: former Ōmiya<br>Green: former Yono<br>Yellow: former Iwatsuki]]
The city was founded on May 1, 2001, and was designated on April 1, 2003 as a [[City designated by government ordinance|government ordinance]]. For the histories of Urawa, Ōmiya and Yono before the merger, see:
* [[Urawa-ku, Saitama#History|Urawa-ku, Saitama]]
* [[Ōmiya-ku, Saitama#History|Ōmiya-ku, Saitama]] and
* [[Chūō-ku, Saitama#History|Yono, Saitama]], respectively.

On April 1, 2005, Saitama absorbed the city of Iwatsuki to its east, which became a new [[Wards of Japan|ward]], [[Iwatsuki-ku, Saitama|Iwatsuki-ku]]. The city evaded the major impact of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Gorman |first=Toby |date=March 24, 2011 |title=Nanaimo's Japanese sister city escapes brunt of earthquake |url=https://nanaimobulletin.com/news/nanaimos-japanese-sister-city-escapes-brunt-of-earthquake-1025884 |access-date=October 25, 2024 |work=Nanaimo News Bulletin}}</ref>

==Government==
Saitama has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 64 members. Saitama contributes 14 members to the Saitama Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between the [[Saitama 1st district]], [[Saitama 5th district]]  and [[Saitama 15th district]]s of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

=== Elections ===
* [[2005 Saitama mayoral election]]
The executive [[mayor#Japan|mayor]], who is directly elected, is Sōichi Aikawa, an [[independent (politician)|independent]] backed by the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] and [[New Komeito Party|Komeito]]. On May 24, 2009, Aikawa lost his bid for reelection against [[Hayato Shimizu]], who was backed by the opposition [[Democratic Party of Japan|DPJ]].<ref>"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090525a4.html DPJ Triumphs in Saitama Election]", ''The Japan Times'', 25 May 2009.</ref>

== Economy ==
Saitama's economy is principally constituted by commercial business. The city is one of many commercial centers of the Greater Tokyo area and serves Saitama Prefecture, North Kanto, and northeast Honshu.

Saitama is also home to various manufacturers, exporting automotive (Honda manufactures the [[Honda Legend]] at [[List of Honda facilities#Japan|Sayama Plant]]), food, optical, precision and pharmaceutical products. [[Calsonic Kansei]], a global automotive company is headquartered in the city.<ref>"[http://www.calsonickansei.co.jp/english/company/data.html Company Profile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211204805/http://www.calsonickansei.co.jp/english/company/data.html |date=2017-02-11 }}." [[Calsonic Kansei]]. Retrieved on January 29, 2015.</ref> [[Iwatsuki-ku, Saitama|Iwatsuki]] is famous for manufacturing of ''[[hinamatsuri]]'' dolls and ornate ''[[kabuto]]'' ([[samurai]] helmets).

== Land use ==
The political and administrative center of the city is Urawa Ward (Urawa Station area), and the economic, commercial, and transportation center is Omiya Ward (Omiya Station area). Located approximately 20 km to 35 km from central Tokyo, Saitama City is a satellite city and bed town in the Tokyo metropolitan area, with a day-night population ratio of 92.8 in 2010, which is less than 100 despites being the prefectural capital and an ordinance-designated city (the southeastern part of Saitama Prefecture). 

Of the 747,000 commuters permanently residing in the city, 175,000, or 23.5%, commute to the Tokyo Special Wards area, making the city home to many so-called "Saitama Tomin". On the other hand, the former Urawa and Omiya cities were designated as core business cities in 1988, and in 2000, [[Saitama New Urban Center]] was opened and local branches of various central government offices were relocated from Tokyo. The southeastern area of Saitama Prefecture tends to be a suburb of Tokyo, and the day/night population ratio is particularly low in Minami ward and Midori ward, which are close to the center of Tokyo. In part for this reason, the southern part of the city, which is closer to Tokyo, tends to have a higher population density than the northern part. In addition, population tends to be concentrated along the Keihin Tohoku Line, Utsunomiya Line, Takasaki Line, and Saikyo Line, which directly connect to central Tokyo, and where both conditions overlap, there is a series of high population density areas of over 20,000 people/km2 from Minami ward to Urawa and Chuo ward.

Urban functions such as administration, commerce, and business are concentrated around major stations such as Urawa, Omiya, and Saitama-new urban stations, which have formed the central urban area since the time of the former Urawa and Omiya cities. The former Omiya City developed as a railroad town and commercial center, and [[Ōmiya Station (Saitama)|Omiya Station]] in particular is one of the busiest and most prominent terminal stations in the Tokyo metropolitan area, with all Shinkansen bullet trains stopping there. The [[Urawa, Saitama|Urawa]] area is also known as an educational district with Saitama University and Saitama Prefectural Urawa High School, as well as an upscale residential area. The Iwatsuki Station area on the [[Tobu Noda Line]] (Tobu Urban Park Line) is also a part of the former Iwatsuki City's central urban area. The center of the former Yono City is Yono-honmachi Station
