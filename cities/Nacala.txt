'''Nacala''', also known as '''Cidade de Nacala''' or '''Nacala-Porto''' is a [[List of cities in Mozambique|city]] on the northern coast of [[Mozambique]]. Located in the southwestern indentation of inner [[Fernao Veloso Bay]], it is the deepest natural [[Port of Nacala|port]] on the east coast of Africa. Nacala serves as the terminal for the [[Nacala railway]], a rail line to the landlocked [[Malawi]]. South of Nacala is [[Mozambique Island]], at one time the capital of Mozambique and now a [[World Heritage Site]].

==History==
Nacala was founded as a little town and developed as a deep waters port and an industrial, agricultural and exporting centre during the last period of the Portuguese rule of the territory which ended in the mid-1970s. Among its major industries were [[cement]], [[sisal]] and [[cashew]]. Other important employers were the seaport, its small modern hospital, and services (banking, insurance and administration).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5ytUJNY0kQ Nacala - no outro lado do tempo], short film of Nacala, [[Portuguese Mozambique]] before independence in 1975.</ref>

== Industry ==

Nacala is site of one of three [[Cement in Africa|cement works]] in [[Mozambique]].

== Transport ==

Nacala is the terminal of the [[Nacala railway]] that connects to the Central East African Railway (CEAR) of [[Malawi]].  The railway system was managed by the [[Railroad Development Corporation]] until September 2008 when it was sold to a group of Mozambican investors.<ref>[http://www.progressiverailroading.com/freightnews/article.asp?id=6132 RDC management]</ref>

It is the location of the deep water port of [[Port of Nacala]]. A coal terminal, operated by the Port of Nacala, is located in the town of [[Nacala-a-Velha]] on the opposite side of the bay from Nacala.

[[Nacala Airport]] is a former airbase that has been converted into an international airport.
