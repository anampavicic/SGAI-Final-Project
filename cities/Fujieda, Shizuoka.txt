Under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] of [[Edo period]] Japan, much of the area of present-day Fujieda was part of [[Tanaka Domain]], and its [[Japanese castle|castle]] formed part of the eastern outlying fortifications of [[Shizuoka, Shizuoka|Sunpu]]. The town also developed as [[Fujieda-juku]], a [[shukuba|post town]] on the [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tōkaidō]] highway connecting [[Edo]] with [[Kyoto]].

During the cadastral reform of the early [[Meiji period]] in 1889, Fujieda-juku became Fujieda Town within [[Shida District, Shizuoka|Shida District]] Shizuoka Prefecture. [[Fujieda Station]] on the [[Tōkaidō Main Line]] railway opened on April 16, 1889, leading to development of the surrounding area. On March 31, 1954, Fujieda merged with neighboring Aoshima Town and four neighboring villages to form Fujieda City. Setoya Village merged on February 15, 1955 and Hirohata Village on April 1, 1957.

On January 1, 2009, the neighboring town of [[Okabe, Shizuoka|Okabe]] (from [[Shida District, Shizuoka|Shida District]]) was merged into Fujieda. Shida District was dissolved as a result of this merger.<ref name="Plannedmerge">{{Cite web |url=http://www.kokudo.or.jp/new/cities/sub/chubu/22.htm |title=市町村合併情報 静岡県 ＜国土地理協会＞ |access-date=2008-09-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070728082506/http://www.kokudo.or.jp/new/cities/sub/chubu/22.htm |archive-date=2007-07-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
