'''Riffa''' ({{langx|ar|الرفاع}}, {{transliteration|ar|DIN|Ar-Rifāʿ}}){{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} is the [[List of cities in Bahrain|second largest city]] in the [[Kingdom of Bahrain]] in terms of area.<ref>[[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]</ref> The city is divided into three parts: {{nowrap|'''East Riffa'''}}, {{nowrap|'''West Riffa'''}} and {{nowrap|'''North Riffa'''}}. All three parts are located in the [[Southern Governorate]].

The city is growing fast: during the [[2001 Bahrain Census|2001 census]], the population was recorded as 79,550 but by 2008 it was estimated at 111,000.<ref>[http://world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&men=gcis&lng=en&des=wg&srt=npan&col=abcdefghinoq&msz=1500&geo=-33 World gazetteer] {{dead link|date=July 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

==History==
Riffa was formerly the principal settlement on [[Bahrain Island]], before being supplanted by the port of [[Manama]] over the course of the 19th century.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}

== East Riffa ==
East Riffa has many attractions; one such attraction is the [[Bahrain National Stadium]], along with a thriving restaurant scene.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Apen-Sadler |first=Dianne |date=2019-12-31 |title=Bahrain area guides: Riffa {{!}} Time Out Bahrain |url=https://www.timeoutbahrain.com/living-in-bahrain/428159-bahrain-area-guides-riffa |access-date=2024-09-22 |website=www.timeoutbahrain.com |language=en-US}}</ref> The city is also home to stores such as East Riffa Market and Carrefour Market, along with providing entertainment services such as Iron Man Gym and Gaga Zumba Hop.

The former is larger, while the latter is more organised and modernised. Playing golf in the [[Royal Golf Club]] is considered one of the top activities to do in the area.<ref>[http://www.theroyalgolfclub.com The Royal Golf Club]</ref>

==West Riffa==
West Riffa is predominantly a residential area. Most of the ruling family, ministers and business investors live in West Riffa. King [[Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa]] of Bahrain lives there, as well as the Prime Minister, Sheikh [[Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa]]. Riffa's famous clock tower is located in the centre of West Riffa. The majority of West Riffa's population is Sunni,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-12-25 |title=Sectarian discrimination in the kingdom of Bahrain:The Unwritten Law {{!}} Bahrain Center for Human Rights |url=http://www.bahrainrights.org/node/384 |access-date=2024-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181225092851/http://www.bahrainrights.org/node/384 |archive-date=2018-12-25 }}</ref> unlike East Riffa which houses a more proportionally mixed Shia-Sunni population along with expats.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Media |first=Salam |date=2014-12-11 |title=The Persecuted Shia Majority in Bahrain |url=https://salam-dhr.org/shia-in-bahrain-without-rights-and-systematic-cleansing-policy-continues/ |access-date=2024-09-28 |website=SALAM DHR |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-09-11 |title=Expatriates in Bahrain: where can expats buy property in Bahrain? |url=https://www.weetas.com/article/expatriates-bahrain/ |access-date=2024-09-28 |website=Weetas Real Estate Blog, Market Stats, Real Estate Analysis |language=en-US}}</ref>
