==History==
[[File:Emirlafia.jpg|thumb|Lafia Emir's Palace ]]
Lafia, also known as Lafian bare-bari, is the capital city of Nasarawa State, North Central Nigeria. Founded by Muhammadu Dunama in late 17th century on the site south of Shabu village. The town now has its 17th [[Emir]] in the person of Hon. Justice [[Sidi Bage|Sidi Bage Muhammad I]] JSC rtd. Lafia became the capital of a prominent local chiefdom in the late 19th century. During the rule of Mohamman Agwai (1881–1903), the Lafia market became one of the most important in the [[Benue River|Benue]] Valley, and a trade route was opened to Loko (56&nbsp;mi [90&nbsp;km] southwest), a [[Benue River]] port. In 1903, the British, who controlled [[Northern Nigeria]] recognized Chief Musa as Lafia's first emir. The emirate formed the major part of the Lafia Division of Benue province. In 1967, the town became part of Benue-Plateau state, and in 1976, it was allocated to Plateau state.
The original inhabitants of Lafia are mainly by the [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]], [[Fula people|Fulani]]  [[Gwandara people|Gwandara]], [[Alago]], Migilli (Koro). It also has large populations of [[Hausa language|Hausa]]. This is due to the hospitable nature of the indigenes and has made the city a miniature Nigeria.

Modern Lafia aside from being an administrative and educational centre, it is also a collecting point for sesame seeds, soybeans, and is a trading centre for yams, sorghum, millet, and cotton. Besides farming, cotton weaving and dyeing are traditionally important activities of the town's inhabitants. Livestock farming is also a prominent activity especially amongst the Fulani herdsmen.

The two royal families of Ari and Dallah Dunama of the [[Kanuri people]] (Bare-Bari) are the ruling houses of the Lafia Emirate. The current Emir is [[Sidi Bage]], from the Dallah Dunama royal family. He succeeded the longest reigning Emir, HRH Isa Mustapha Agwai I (1976–2019).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailytrust.com.ng/isah-mustapha-agwai-1-1935-2019.html|title=Isah Mustapha Agwai 1 [1935-2019]|date=2019-01-17|website=Daily Trust|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://leadership.ng/2019/01/11/life-and-times-of-isa-mustapha-agwai-1/|title=StackPath|website=leadership.ng|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://punchng.com/emir-of-lafia-buried-amid-tears/|title=Emir of Lafia buried amid tears|website=Punch Newspapers|date=11 January 2019|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref>
