==Nomenclature==

Most of Ukraine's oblasts are named after their [[Capital (political)|capital]] cities, officially called "oblast centers" ({{langx|uk|обласний центр}}, [[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]] ''oblasnyi tsentr''). The name of each oblast is a [[relative clause|relative]] [[adjective]], formed by adding a feminine [[suffix]] to the name of respective center city: ''Kharkiv'' is the center of  the ''Kharkivs’ka oblast’'' (Kharkiv Oblast). Most oblasts are also sometimes referred to in a feminine noun form, following the convention of traditional regional place names, ending with the suffix "-shchyna", as is the case with the Kharkiv Oblast, ''Kharkivshchyna''.

{{See also |Romanization of Ukrainian}}

==Geography==
The oblast borders [[Russia]] ([[Belgorod Oblast]]) to the north, [[Luhansk Oblast]] to the east, [[Donetsk Oblast]] to the southeast, [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]] to the southwest, [[Poltava Oblast]] to the west and [[Sumy Oblast]] to the northwest.

==History==
{{further|Sloboda Ukraine#History}}
[[File:HolodomorKharkiv 1933 Wienerberger.jpg|thumb|right|Starved people on the street during the [[Holodomor]] in Kharkiv, 1933]]
During the [[Okruhas of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic#Reorganization of 1923–1926|Soviet administrative reform of 1923–1929]], the [[Kharkov Governorate]] was abolished in 1925 leaving its five [[Okruhas of the Ukrainian SSR|okruhas]]: Okhtyrka (originally Bohodukhiv), Izyum, Kupyansk, Sumy, and Kharkiv. Introduced in the Soviet Union in 1923, a similar subdivisions existed in Ukraine back in 1918. In 1930 all okruhas were also abolished with [[Raions of Ukraine|raions]] becoming the first level of subdivision of Ukraine until 1932.

The modern Kharkiv Oblast was established on 27 February 1932. In the summer of 1932, some parts of the oblast were included in the newly created [[Donetsk Oblast]] originally centered in [[Bakhmut|Artemivsk]] (later in [[Donetsk|Stalino]]). Then in the fall, some territories of the Kharkiv Oblast were used in the creation of [[Chernihiv Oblast]]. More territories became part of [[Poltava Oblast]] in fall of 1937 and [[Sumy Oblast]] in winter of 1939.

During the [[Holodomor]] the population of the Kharkiv Oblast together with Kyiv Oblast suffered the most. During [[World War II]], it was the site or large Soviet massacres of Poles ([[Piatykhatky, Kharkiv Oblast|Piatykhatky]]) and German massacres of Jews ([[Drobytsky Yar]]). The region saw major fighting during World War II in several [[Battle of Kharkov (disambiguation)|Battles of Kharkov]] between 1941 and 1943.

During the [[1991 Ukrainian independence referendum|1991 referendum]], 86.33% of votes in Kharkiv Oblast were in favor of the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine]]. A survey conducted in December 2014 by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found 4.2% of the oblast's population supported their region joining Russia, 71.5% did not support the idea, and the rest were undecided or did not respond.<ref name=DT150103>{{cite news |url= http://dt.ua/UKRAINE/lishe-3-ukrayinciv-hochut-priyednannya-yih-oblasti-do-rosiyi-160641_.html |script-title=uk:Лише 3% українців хочуть приєднання їх області до Росії |language= uk |trans-title= Only 3% of Ukrainians want their region to become part of Russia |work= [[Dzerkalo Tyzhnia]] |date= 3 January 2015 }}</ref>

Following the [[Euromaidan]], there was [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|pro-Russian unrest]] in the region, and central government buildings were taken over by separatists in a failed attempt to create a separatist 'Kharkov's People's Republic'.<ref name=osw>{{Cite web |last=Piechal |first=Tomasz |date=2015-06-09 |title=The Kharkiv oblast: a fragile stability |url=https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/osw-commentary/2015-06-09/kharkiv-oblast-a-fragile-stability |access-date=2023-08-10 |website=OSW Centre for Eastern Studies |language=en}}</ref> The region also became a very popular destination for refugees from the [[Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine|Russian-occupied]] [[Donetsk Oblast|Donetsk]] and [[Luhansk Oblast]] regions.<ref name=osw/>
