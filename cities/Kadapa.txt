'''Kadapa''' is a city in the southern part of [[Andhra Pradesh]], India. It is located in the [[Rayalaseema]] region, and is the district headquarters of [[YSR Kadapa district]]. As of the [[2022 Census of India]], the city had a population of 466,000, a 2.42% increase from 2021. It is located {{convert|8|km|mi}} south of the [[Penna River]]. The city is surrounded on three sides by the [[Nallamala]] and [[Palkonda Hills]] lying on the tectonic landscape between the Eastern and Western ghats. Black and red ferrous soils occupy the region. The city is nicknamed "Gadapa" ('threshold') since it is the gateway from the west to the hills of [[Tirumala]].

Kadapa has been under different rulers in its history, including the [[Cholas]], the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] and [[Kingdom of Mysore]].

== Etymology ==

The city's name originated from the [[Telugu language|Telugu]] word "Gadapa" meaning threshold or gate.  It acquired this name with its relation to the Venkateswara Temple, Tirumala; one had to pass through this city in the olden days to reach Venkateswara Temple, Tirumala. In Telugu, the word Gadapa means a threshold and over time, the name evolved into Kadapa. It was spelled "Cuddapah" but was changed to "Kadapa" on 19 August 2005 to reflect the local pronunciation of the name.<ref>{{cite news|title=It will be 'Kadapa' henceforth|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/08/18/stories/2005081805760200.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710054942/http://www.hindu.com/2005/08/18/stories/2005081805760200.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 July 2010|access-date=8 October 2013|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=18 August 2005}}</ref> Some of the inscriptions found recently have mentioned about this place as Hiranyanagaram as well as there are official records that show it was also called Nekanamabad.dilazak empire

== History ==

=== Post classical era (200–800 AD) ===
The history of Kadapa dates back to the second century BC. The evidences of [[Archaeological Survey of India]] suggest that it started with [[Maurya Empire|Mourya]] and [[Satavahana dynasty]]. And since then it has been under the rule of numerous dynasties including [[Chalukya]], [[Cholas]] and [[Pallava]]. Among all of these dynasties, first one to rule over Kadapa was Pallava dynasty. Pallava kings ruled over the city during the fifth century after penetrating into North of Kadapa. After that Cholas ruled till the eighth century after defeating Pallavas. Later [[Bana kingdom|Banas]] ruled over Kadapa.<ref name="Kadapa municipal Corporation">{{cite web|title=Kadapa Municipal Corporation About Kadapa|url=http://www.kadapamunicipalcorporation.org/Aboutkadapa.aspx|website=Kadapa Municipal Corporation|access-date=28 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160214105329/http://www.kadapamunicipalcorporation.org/Aboutkadapa.aspx|archive-date=14 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Era (8th to 18th centuries AD) ===
[[File:Vijayanagara_1450s.png|upright=0.8|thumb|left|Ancient Kadapa region part of [[Vijayanagara Empire]] ruled between 1336 - 1646]]
[[File:Siddhout Fort near Kadapa.jpg|thumb|Siddhout fort near Kadapa|left]]

After Banas, [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakutas]] ruled Kadapa region Among the popular rulers of Kadapa was King [[Indra III]], who served during the period of 915&nbsp;AD. In his period, Kadapa gained a lot of power and influence, which declined with his death later. [[Telugu Cholas]], were the next one to rule Kadapa. [[Ambadeva]] ruled Kadapa in the latter half of the 13th century when he established the capital at Vallur, which is located at a distance of about 15&nbsp;km from Kadapa.

After the death of Ambadeva, the Kakatiya king [[Prataparudra II]] ruled until the early 14th century. Prataparudra was defeated by Muslims in the reign of [[Khalji dynasty|Khalji]] emperor [[Alauddin Khalji|Alla Uddin]]. Later in the mid-14th century, Hindus of Vijayanagar dynasty drove the Muslims out of Warangal and subsequently Kadapa and ruled for around two centuries till they were defeated by the Gulbarga sultans. The most illustrious ruler during this time was [[Pemmasani Nayaks|Pemmasani Thimma Nayudu (1422 CE)]] who developed the region and constructed many tanks and temples here. Muslims of Golkonda conquered the region in 1594 when [[Mir Jumla II]] raided [[Gandikota]] fort and defeated Chinna Thimma Nayudu by treachery. [[Marathas]] took over the city in 1740 after defeating the Nawab of Kurnool and Cuddapah.

[[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]] also ruled the city (1784–1792) before it fell in the hands of Nizam by the [[Treaty of Seringapatam]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kadapaonline.in/city-guide/history-of-kadapa |title=History of Kadapa |work=kadapaonline.in}}</ref> in 1792.
Tipu's grandmother, Hyder Ali’s mother Fatima Fakhr-un-Nisa was the daughter of Mir Muin-ud-Din, the governor of the fort of Kadapa.

Later the [[British Raj|British]] took control of Kadapa District in 1800 CE. Although the town is an ancient one, it was probably extended by dilazak [[Neknam Khan]], the [[Qutb Shahi]] commander, who called the extension as "Neknamabad". The name "Neknamabad" was used for the town for some time but slowly fell into disuse and the records of the 18th century refer to the rulers not as "Nawab of Kadapa". Except for some years in the beginning, Kadapa District was the seat of the Mayana Nawabs in the 18th century. With the British occupation of the tract in 1800 CE, it became the headquarters of one of the four subordinate collectorates under the principal collector [[Sir Thomas Munro]]. In 2004, Kadapa was recognised as a municipal corporation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cdma.gov.in/KADAPA/ |title=Brief about Kadapa Municipal Corporation |publisher=Municipal Administration & Urban Development Department, Govt. of Andhra Pradesh |access-date=27 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116192051/http://cdma.gov.in/KADAPA/ |archive-date=16 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
