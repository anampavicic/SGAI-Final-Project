First documented in 1147, Moscow grew to serve as the capital of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]]. When the [[Tsardom of Russia]] was proclaimed, Moscow remained the political and economic center for most of its history. Under the reign of [[Peter the Great]], the Russian capital was moved to the newly founded city of [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1712, decreasing Moscow's influence. Following the [[Russian Revolution]] and the establishment of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], the capital was moved back to Moscow in 1918, where it later became the political center of the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>[[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union]] - Section VIII, Article 172: "The Capital of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is the city of Moscow."</ref> In the aftermath of the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Moscow remained the capital city of the newly established Russian Federation.

==Etymology==
The city's name is thought to be derived from the [[Moskva River]].<ref name="Vasmer">{{Vasmer|Москва}}</ref><ref name="Smol">{{cite book |last1=Smolitskaya |first1=G.P. |title=Toponimicheskyi slovar' Tsentral'noy Rossii |script-title=ru:Топонимический словарь Центральной России |date=2002 |pages=211–2017 |language=ru}}</ref> Theories of the origin of the name of the river have been proposed.

The most linguistically well-grounded and widely accepted is from the Proto-Balto-Slavic root *''mŭzg''-/''muzg''- from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] *''{{PIE|meu}}''- "wet",<ref name="Smol" /><ref name="Trubach">{{cite book |editor-last=Trubachyov |editor-first=O.N. |editor-link=Oleg Trubachyov |title=Etimologicheskyi slovar' slavyanskikh yazykov |script-title=ru:Этимологический словарь славянских языков |date=1994 |at=V. 20: pp. 19–20, 197, 202–203; V. 21: pp. 12, 19–20, 76–79 |language=ru}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Pokorny |first1=Julius |author-link=Julius Pokorny |title=Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch |chapter=meu |chapter-url=http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/U/P1312.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310064838/http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/U/P1312.html |archive-date=March 10, 2016 }}</ref> so the name ''Moskva'' might signify a river at a wetland or marsh.<ref name="Vasmer" /> Its [[cognate]]s include {{langx|ru|музга}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|muzga}} "pool, puddle", {{langx|lt|mazgoti}} and {{langx|lv|mazgāt}} "to wash", {{langx|sa|májjati}} "to drown", {{langx|la|mergō}} "to dip, immerse".<ref name="Vasmer" /><ref name="Trubach" /> In many Slavic countries Moskov is a surname, most common in Russia, [[Bulgaria]], [[Ukraine]] and [[North Macedonia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://forebears.io/surnames/moskov|title=Moskov Surname Meaning, Origins & Distribution|website=forebears.io|access-date=December 10, 2018|archive-date=December 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181211010136/https://forebears.io/surnames/moskov|url-status=live}}</ref> Additionally, there are similarly named places in [[Poland]] like [[Mozgawa]].<ref name="Vasmer" /><ref name="Smol" /><ref name="Trubach" /> According to a [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]] hypothesis, the [[Volga Finns|Merya]] and [[Muromians|Muroma]] people, who were among the pre-Slavic tribes which inhabited the area, called the river ''Mustajoki'' "Black river", and the name of the river derives from this term.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tarkiainen |first=Kari |title=Ruotsin itämaa |publisher=Svenska litteratursällskapet i Finland |year=2010 |isbn=978-951-583-212-2 |location=Helsinki |page=19}}</ref> Other theories, having little or no scientific basis, are rejected by linguists.<ref name="Vasmer" /><ref name="Smol" />

The original [[Old East Slavic|Old Russian]] form of the name is reconstructed as *{{lang|orv|Москы}}, *{{lang|orv-Latn|Mosky}},<ref name=Vasmer/><ref name=Smol/> hence it was one of a few Slavic [[wikt:Category:Proto-Slavic v-stem nouns|''ū''-stem nouns]]. As with other nouns of that declension, it had been undergoing a morphological transformation at the early stage of the development of the language, as a result, the first written references in the 12th century were {{lang|orv|Московь}}, {{lang|orv-Latn|Moskovĭ}} ([[accusative case]]), {{lang|orv|Москви}}, {{lang|orv-Latn|Moskvi}} ([[locative case]]), {{lang|orv|Москвe/Москвѣ}}, {{lang|orv-Latn|Moskve/Moskvě}} ([[genitive case]]).<ref name=Vasmer/><ref name=Smol/> From the latter forms came the modern Russian name {{lang|ru|Москва}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|Moskva}}, which is a result of [[morphological leveling|morphological generalization]] with the numerous Slavic [[wikt:Category:Proto-Slavic hard a-stem nouns|''ā''-stem nouns]].

The site of modern-day Moscow has been inhabited since prehistoric times.

Daniel ruled Moscow as Grand Duke until 1303 and established it as a prosperous city that would eclipse its parent principality of Vladimir by the 1320s. On the right bank of the Moskva River, at a distance of {{convert|5|mi|km|0|spell=in|order=flip}} from the Kremlin, by 1282 Daniel founded the first monastery with the wooden church of St. Daniel-Stylite, which is now the Danilov Monastery. Daniel died in 1303, aged 42. Before his death, he became a monk and, according to his will, was buried in the cemetery of the St. Daniel Monastery.

Moscow was stable and prosperous for many years and attracted refugees from across Russia. The Rurikids maintained large landholdings by practicing [[primogeniture]], whereby all land was passed to the eldest sons. By 1304, [[Yury of Moscow]] contested with [[Mikhail of Tver]] for the throne of the principality of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]]. [[Ivan I of Russia|Ivan I]] eventually defeated [[Tver]] to become the sole collector of taxes for the [[Mongol]] rulers, making Moscow the capital of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]]. By paying high tribute, Ivan won an important concession from the [[Khan (title)|Khan]].

[[File:Вид на Спасскую башню от Исторического музея.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|The [[Spasskaya Tower]], built in 1491|alt=]]
While the Khan of the [[Golden Horde]] initially attempted to limit Moscow's influence, when the growth of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] began to threaten all of Russia, the Khan strengthened Moscow to counterbalance Lithuania, allowing it to become one of the most powerful cities in Russia. In 1380, prince [[Dmitry Donskoy]] of Moscow led a united Russian army to an important victory over the Mongols in the [[Battle of Kulikovo]]. Afterward, Moscow took the leading role in liberating Russia from Mongol domination. In 1480, [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]] had [[Great standing on the Ugra river|finally broken the Russians free]] from [[Tatar]] control, and Moscow became the capital of an empire that would eventually encompass all of Russia and [[Siberia]], and parts of many other lands.

In 1462 Ivan III became Grand Prince of Moscow (then part of the medieval Muscovy state). He began fighting the Tatars, enlarged the territory of Muscovy, and enriched his capital city. By 1500 it had a population of 100,000 and was one of the largest cities in the world. He conquered the far larger principality of Novgorod to the north, which had been allied to the hostile Lithuanians. Thus he enlarged the territory sevenfold, from {{convert|430,000|to|2,800,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}}. He took control of the ancient "[[Novgorod Chronicle]]" and made it a propaganda vehicle for his regime.<ref>J. L. I. Fennell, ''Ivan the Great of Moscow'' (1961) p. 354</ref><ref>Sergei M. Soloviev, and John J. Windhausen, eds. ''History of Russia. Vol. 8: Russian Society in the Age of Ivan III'' (1979)</ref>

The original [[Moscow Kremlin]] was built in the 14th century. It was reconstructed by Ivan, who in the 1480s invited architects from [[Renaissance Italy]], such as [[Petrus Antonius Solarius]], who designed the new Kremlin wall and its towers, and [[Marco Ruffo]] who designed the new palace for the prince. The Kremlin walls as they now appear are those designed by Solarius, completed in 1495. The Kremlin's Great Bell Tower was built in 1505–08 and augmented to its present height in 1600. A trading settlement, or ''posad'', grew up to the east of the Kremlin, in the area known as ''Zaradye''. In the time of Ivan III, the [[Red Square]], originally named the Hollow Field appeared.

In 1508–1516, the Italian architect [[Aloisio the New|Aleviz Fryazin (Novy)]] arranged for the construction of a moat in front of the eastern wall, which would connect the [[Moskva River|Moskva]] and [[Neglinnaya River|Neglinnaya]] and be filled with water from Neglinnaya. Known as the Alevizov moat and with a length of {{convert|541|m|ft|abbr=off}}, width of {{convert|36|m|ft|abbr=off}}, and depth of {{convert|9.5|to(-)|13|m|ft|abbr=off}} was lined with limestone and, in 1533, fenced on both sides with low, {{convert|4|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off|adj=mid|-thick}} cogged-brick walls.{{anchor|Tsardom}}

In the 16th and 17th centuries, three circular defenses were built: [[Kitay-gorod]], the White City and the Earthen City.

The [[Khanate of Crimea|Crimean Tatars]] attacked again in 1591, but were held back by new walls, built between 1584 and 1591 by a craftsman named [[Fyodor Kon]]. In 1592, an outer earth rampart with 50 towers was erected around the city, including an area on the right bank of the Moscow River. As an outermost line of defense, a chain of strongly fortified monasteries was established beyond the ramparts to the south and east, principally the [[Novodevichy Convent]] and [[Donskoy Monastery|Donskoy]], [[Danilov Monastery|Danilov]], [[Simonov Monastery|Simonov]], [[Novospassky Monastery|Novospasskiy]], and [[Andronikov Monastery|Andronikov]] monasteries, most of which now house museums. From its ramparts, the city became poetically known as ''Bielokamennaya'', the "White-Walled". The city's limits as marked by the ramparts, are now marked by the [[Garden Ring]]. Three square gates existed on the east side of the Kremlin wall, which in the 17th century, were known as Konstantino-Eleninsky, Spassky, Nikolsky (after the icons of Constantine and Helen, the Saviour and St. Nicholas that hung over them). The last two were directly opposite the Red Square, while the Konstantino-Elenensky gate was located behind Saint Basil's Cathedral.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

The [[Russian famine of 1601–03]] killed perhaps 100,000 in Moscow. Between 1610 and 1612, troops of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] occupied Moscow, as its ruler [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund III]] tried to take the Russian throne. In 1612, [[Nizhny Novgorod]] and other Russian cities led by prince [[Dmitry Pozharsky]] and [[Kuzma Minin]] rose against the Polish occupants, [[Time of Troubles|besieged the Kremlin, and expelled them]]. In 1613, the [[Zemsky Sobor]] elected [[Michael I of Russia|Michael Romanov]] tsar, establishing the [[Romanov dynasty]]. The 17th century saw several risings, such as the liberation of Moscow from the Polish–Lithuanian invaders (1612), the [[Salt Riot]] (1648), the [[Copper Riot]] (1662), and the [[Moscow Uprising of 1682]].

During the first half of the 17th century, the population doubled from 100,000 to 200,000, and it expanded beyond its ramparts in the latter part of the century. In the middle of the 17th century, 20% of Moscow suburb's inhabitants were from the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], being driven from their homeland by Muscovite invaders.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Абецедарский|first=Л. С.|title=Белоруссия и Россия|year=1978|location=Москва|pages=213|language=ru}}</ref> By 1682, there were 692 households established north of the ramparts, by [[Ukrainians]] and [[Belarusians]] abducted from their hometowns in the course of the [[Russo-Polish War (1654–1667)]].

The term ''meshchane'' acquired pejorative connotations in 18th-century Russia and today means "petty bourgeois" or "narrow-minded philistine".<ref>П.В.Сытин, "Из истории московских улиц", М, 1948, p. 296.</ref> The entire city of the late 17th century are contained within what is today Moscow's [[Central Administrative Okrug]].

After losing the status as capital, the population at first decreased, from 200,000 in the 17th century to 130,000 in 1750. But after 1750, the population grew tenfold over the remaining duration of the Russian Empire, reaching 1.8 million by 1915.

In 1730, permanent street lights were introduced, and by 1867 many streets had a gaslight. In 1883, near the Prechistinskiye Gates, arc lamps were installed. In 1741 Moscow was surrounded by a barricade {{convert|25|mi|km|order=flip}} long, the Kamer-Kollezhskiy barrier, with 16 gates at which customs tolls were collected. Its line is traced today by several streets called ''val'' ("ramparts"). In the early 19th century, the Arch of Konstantino-Elenensky gate was paved with bricks, but the Spassky Gate was the main front gate of the Kremlin and used for royal entrances. From this gate, wooden and stone bridges stretched across the moat. Books were sold on this bridge and stone platforms were built nearby for guns – "raskats". The [[Tsar Cannon]] was located on the platform of the [[Lobnoye mesto]]. The road connecting Moscow with St. Petersburg, now the [[M10 highway (Russia)|M10 highway]], was completed in 1746, its Moscow end following the old [[Tver]] road, which had existed since the 16th century. It became known as ''[[Leningradsky Prospekt|Peterburskoye Schosse]]'' after it was paved in the 1780s. [[Petrovsky Palace]] was built in 1776–1780 by [[Matvey Kazakov]]. Between 1781 and 1804 the Mytischinskiy water pipe (the first in Russia) was built.

When [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|invaded]] Russia in 1812, the Moscovites were evacuated. The [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|Moscow fire]] was principally the effect of Russian sabotage. Napoleon's ''[[Grande Armée]]'' was forced to retreat and nearly annihilated by the devastating Russian winter. In 1813, following the destruction during the French occupation, a ''Commission for the Construction of the City of Moscow'' was established. It launched a great program of rebuilding, including a partial replanning of the centre. Among many buildings constructed, or reconstructed, was the [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] and the [[Kremlin Armoury]], the [[Moscow University]], the [[Moscow Manege]] (Riding School), and the [[Bolshoi Theatre]]. The [[Arbat Street]] had been in existence since at least the 15th century, but it was developed into a prestigious area during the 18th century. It was destroyed in the fire of 1812 and was rebuilt completely in the early 19th century. [[Moscow State University]] was established in 1755. Its main building was reconstructed after the 1812 fire by [[Domenico Giliardi]]. The ''[[Moskovskiye Vedomosti]]'' newspaper appeared from 1756, originally in weekly intervals, and from 1859 as a daily newspaper.

In the 1830s, general [[Alexander Bashilov]] planned the first regular grid of city streets north from Petrovsky Palace. [[Khodynka Field|Khodynka field]] south of the highway was used for military training. Smolensky Rail station (forerunner of [[Belorussky Rail Terminal]]) was inaugurated in 1870. [[Sokolniki Park]], in the 18th century the home of the tsar's falconers well outside Moscow, became contiguous with the expanding city in the later 19th century and was developed into a public municipal park in 1878. The suburban [[Savyolovsky Rail Terminal]] was built in 1902. In January 1905, the institution of the City Governor, or [[Mayor]], was officially introduced, and Alexander Adrianov became Moscow's first official mayor.

When [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] came to power in 1762, the city's filth and the smell of sewage were depicted by observers as a symptom of disorderly lifestyles of lower-class Russians recently arrived from the farms. Elites called for improved sanitation, which became part of Catherine's plans for increasing control over social life. National political and military successes from 1812 through 1855 calmed the critics and validated efforts to produce a more enlightened and stable society. There was less discussion about the poor conditions of public health. However, in the wake of Russia's failures in the Crimean War in 1855–56, confidence in the ability of the state to maintain order in the slums eroded, and demands for improved public health put it back on the agenda.<ref>Alexander M.

With the [[Russian cultural heritage register#Denial of heritage (1917–1941)|change in values imposed by communist ideology]], the tradition of preserving cultural heritage was broken. Independent preservation societies, even those that defended only secular landmarks, were disbanded by the end of the 1920s. A new anti-religious campaign, launched in 1929, coincided with the collectivization of peasants; the destruction of churches in the cities peaked around 1932. In 1937 letters were written to the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] to rename Moscow to "Stalindar" or "Stalinodar".<ref>One from an elderly pensioner whose dream was to "live in Stalinodar" and had selected the name to represent the "gift" (dar) of the genius of Stalin.

This was following Stalin banning the renaming of places in his name in 1936. Simon Montefiore, The Court of the Red Tsar</ref>

During World War II, the Soviet State Committee of Defence and the General Staff of the [[Red Army]] were located in Moscow. In 1941, 16 divisions of the national volunteers (more than 160,000 people), 25 battalions, and 4 engineering regiments were formed among the Muscovites. Between October 1941 and January 1942, the German [[Army Group Centre]] was stopped at the outskirts of the city, then driven off in the [[Battle of Moscow]]. Many factories were evacuated, together with much of the government, and from October 20 the city was declared to be in a siege. Its remaining inhabitants built and manned antitank defenses, while the city was bombarded from the air. On May 1, 1944, a medal "For the defence of Moscow" and in 1947 another medal "In memory of the 800th anniversary of Moscow" was instituted. [[German casualties in World War II|German]] and [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|Soviet casualties]] during the battle have been debated, as sources provide different estimates. Total casualties between September 30, 1941, and January 7, 1942, are estimated to be between 248,000 and 400,000 for the [[Wehrmacht]] and 650,000-1,280,000 for the Red Army.<ref>''Moscow Encyclopedia'', ed.

During the postwar years, there was a housing crisis, solved by the invention of [[Tower block|high-rise apartments]]. There are over 11,000 of these standardised and prefabricated apartment blocks, housing most of Moscow's population, making it by far the city with the most high-rise buildings.<ref name="hrranking">{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/statistics/skyline-ranking|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106210644/http://www.emporis.com/statistics/skyline-ranking|url-status=usurped|archive-date=November 6, 2012|title=Skyline Ranking|website=Emporis}}</ref> Apartments were built and partly furnished in the factory, before being raised and stacked into tall columns. The popular Soviet-era comic film ''[[Irony of Fate]]'' parodies this construction method. The city of [[Zelenograd]] was built in 1958 at {{convert|37|km|abbr=off}} from the city centre to the north-west, along with the [[Leningradskoye Shosse]], and incorporated as one of Moscow's [[Administrative divisions of Moscow|administrative okrugs]]. [[Moscow State University]] moved to its campus on [[Sparrow Hills]] in 1953.

In 1959 Nikita Khrushchev launched [[Russian cultural heritage register#Khrushchev's offensive (1959–1964)|his anti-religious campaign]]. Of Moscow's fifty churches operating in 1959, thirty were closed and six demolished. On May 8, 1965, due to the actual 20th [[Victory Day (9 May)|anniversary of the victory]] in World War II, Moscow was awarded a title of the [[Hero City (Soviet Union)|Hero City]].

The [[Moscow Ring Road]] (MKAD) was opened in 1961. It had four lanes running {{convert|109|km|abbr=off}} along the city borders. The MKAD marked the administrative boundaries of the city until the 1980s, when outlying suburbs beyond the ring road were incorporated. In 1980, Moscow hosted the [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]], which were boycotted by the US and other Western countries due to the Soviet Union's invasion of [[Afghanistan]] in 1979. In 1991 Moscow was the scene of a [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|coup attempt]] by conservative communists opposed to the [[Perestroika|liberal reforms]] of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].

===1991–present===
When the USSR was dissolved in 1991, Moscow remained the capital of the [[Russian Federation]]. Since then, a market economy has emerged, producing an explosion of Western-style retailing, services, architecture, and lifestyles. The city continued to grow during the 1990s to 2000s, its population rising from below nine to above ten million. Mason and Nigmatullina argue that Soviet-era urban-growth controls produced controlled and sustainable metropolitan development, typified by the greenbelt built in 1935. Since then, however, there has been a dramatic growth of low-density suburban sprawl, created by heavy demand for single-family dwellings as opposed to crowded apartments. In 1995–97 the MKAD ring road was widened from the initial four to ten lanes.

In December 2002 [[Bulvar Dmitriya Donskogo]] became the first Moscow Metro station that opened beyond the limits of MKAD. The [[Third Ring Road (Moscow)|Third Ring Road]], intermediate between the early 19th-century [[Garden Ring]] and the Soviet-era outer ring road, was completed in 2004. The greenbelt is becoming more and more fragmented, and satellite cities are appearing at the fringe. Summer dachas are being converted into year-round residences, and with the proliferation of automobiles there is heavy traffic congestion.<ref>Robert J.

===Time===
{{Main|Moscow Time}}
Moscow serves as the reference point for the time zone used in most of [[European Russia]], [[Belarus]] and the [[Republic of Crimea (Russia)|Republic of Crimea]]. The areas operate in what is referred to in international standards as ''Moscow Standard Time (MSK, {{lang|ru|МСК}})'', which is 3 hours ahead of [[UTC]], or [[UTC+3]]. [[Daylight saving time]] is no longer observed. According to the geographical [[longitude]] the average [[solar noon]] in Moscow occurs at 12:30.<ref>{{cite web|title=Time in Moscow, Russia|url=http://dateandtime.info/city.php?id=524901|access-date=March 31, 2018|archive-date=April 1, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180401075524/http://dateandtime.info/city.php?id=524901|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Moscow, VDNKh, Central Alley after rain (30580970263).jpg|thumb|[[Exhibition of Achievements of National Economy|VDNKh]] after rain]]
Moscow has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dfb'') with long, cold (although average by Russian standards) winters usually lasting from mid-November to the end of March, and warm summers. More extreme continental climates at the same latitude – such as parts of [[Eastern Canada]] or [[Siberia]] – have much colder winters than Moscow, suggesting that there is still significant moderation from the [[Atlantic Ocean]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2024}} despite the fact that Moscow is far from the sea. Weather can fluctuate widely, with temperatures ranging from {{convert|−25|C}} in the city and {{convert|−30|C}} in the suburbs to above {{convert|5|C}} in the winter, and from {{convert|10|to|35|C}} in the summer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pogoda.ru.net/monitor.php?id=27612&month=6&year=2010 |script-title=ru:Погода и Климат – Климатический монитор: погода в Москве |trans-title=The weather in Moscow.

Typical high temperatures in the warm months of June, July, and August are around a comfortable {{convert|20|to|26|C}}, but during heat waves (which can occur between May and September), daytime high temperatures often exceed {{convert|30|C}}, sometimes for a week or two at a time. In the winter, average temperatures normally drop to approximately {{convert|−10|C}}, though almost every winter there are periods of warmth with day temperatures rising above {{convert|0|C}}, and periods of cooling with night temperatures falling below {{convert|−20|C}}. These periods usually last about a week or two. The growing season in Moscow normally lasts for 156 days usually around May 1 to October 5.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://weatherspark.com/y/100524/Average-Weather-in-Moscow-Russia-Year-Round|title=Average Weather in Moscow, Russia, Year Round - Weather Spark|access-date=July 30, 2021|archive-date=July 30, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210730194124/https://weatherspark.com/y/100524/Average-Weather-in-Moscow-Russia-Year-Round|url-status=live}}</ref>

The lowest ever recorded temperature was {{convert|−42.1|C}} in January 1940. Snow, which is present for about five months a year, often begins to fall mid-October, while snow cover lies in late November and melts at the end of March.

On average, Moscow has 1731 hours of sunshine per year, varying from a low of 8% in December to 52% from May to August.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meteoweb.ru/2014/pss2014.php|title=Sunshine hours in 2014 and averages|language=ru|access-date=November 15, 2015|archive-date=January 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200125061126/http://meteoweb.ru/2014/pss2014.php|url-status=live}}</ref> This large annual variation is due to convective cloud formation. In the winter, moist air from the Atlantic condenses in the cold continental interior, resulting in very overcast conditions. However, this same continental influence results in considerably sunnier summers than oceanic cities of similar latitude such as [[Edinburgh]]. Between 2004 and 2010, the average was between 1800 and 2000 hours with a tendency to more sunshine in summer months, up to a record 411 hours in July 2014, 79% of possible sunshine.

Temperatures in the centre of Moscow are often significantly higher than in the outskirts and nearby suburbs, especially in winter. For example, if the average January temperature in the north-east of Moscow is {{convert|−6.2|C}}, in the suburbs it is about {{convert|−8.3|C}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pogodaiklimat.ru/climate/27532.htm|title=Climate of Vladimir|language=ru|access-date=November 15, 2015|archive-date=October 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191027025756/http://www.pogodaiklimat.ru/climate/27532.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> The temperature difference between the centre of Moscow and nearby areas of [[Moscow Oblast]] can sometimes be more than {{convert|10|C-change}} on frosty winter nights.

===Architecture===
[[File:Museo Estatal de Historia, Moscú, Rusia, 2016-10-03, DD 49.jpg|thumb|left|The [[State Historical Museum]], an example of the [[Russian Revival architecture|Neo-Russian style]]]]
[[File:Moscow July 2011-7a.jpg|thumb|The [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], an example of [[Neo-Byzantine architecture in the Russian Empire|Neo-Byzantine architecture]]]]
Moscow's architecture is world-renowned. Moscow is the site of [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]], with its elegant [[onion dome]]s, as well as the [[Cathedral of Christ the Savior]] and the [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|Seven Sisters]]. The first Kremlin was built in the middle of the 12th century.

Medieval Moscow's design was of concentric walls and intersecting radial thoroughfares. This layout, as well as Moscow's rivers, helped shape Moscow's design in subsequent centuries.

The Kremlin was rebuilt in the 15th century. Its towers and some of its churches were built by Italian architects, lending the city some of the aurae of the renaissance. From the end of the 15th century, the city was embellished by masonry structures such as monasteries, palaces, walls, towers, and churches.

The city's appearance had not changed much by the 18th century. Houses were made of pine and spruce logs, with shingled roofs plastered with sod or covered by birch bark. The rebuilding of Moscow in the second half of the 18th century was necessitated by constant fires and the needs of the nobility. Much of the wooden city was replaced by buildings in the classical style.<ref>{{cite book|title=The architecture and planning of classical Moscow: a cultural history|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_STn96Qeg3D4C|last=Schmidt|first=Albert J|publisher=American Philosophical Society|date=April 1, 1989|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_STn96Qeg3D4C/page/n24 5]–25}}</ref>

For much of its architectural history, Moscow was dominated by Orthodox churches. However, the overall appearance of the city changed drastically during Soviet times, especially as a result of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s large-scale effort to "modernize" Moscow. Stalin's plans for the city included a network of broad avenues and roadways, some of them over ten lanes wide, which, while greatly simplifying movement through the city, were constructed at the expense of a great number of historical buildings and districts. Among the many casualties of Stalin's demolitions was the [[Sukharev Tower]], a longtime city landmark, as well as mansions and commercial buildings. The city's newfound status as the capital of a deeply [[secular]] nation, made religiously significant buildings especially vulnerable to demolition. Many of the city's churches, which in most cases were some of Moscow's oldest and most prominent buildings, were destroyed; some notable examples include the [[Kazan Cathedral, Moscow|Kazan Cathedral]] and the Cathedral of Christ the Savior. During the 1990s, both were rebuilt. Many smaller churches, however, were lost.<ref>{{cite journal|title=onlinelibrary.wiley.com|journal=City & Society|volume=10|pages=269–314|publisher=onlinelibrary.wiley.com|date=June 28, 2008|doi=10.1525/city.1998.10.1.269|last1=Khazanov|first1=Anatoly M.|s2cid=145807994}}</ref>

While the later Stalinist period was characterized by the curtailing of creativity and architectural innovation, the earlier post-revolutionary years saw a plethora of radical new buildings created in the city. Especially notable were the constructivist architects associated with [[VKHUTEMAS]], responsible for such landmarks as Lenin's Mausoleum. Another prominent architect was [[Vladimir Shukhov]], famous for Shukhov Tower, just one of many [[Hyperboloid structure|hyperboloid towers]] designed by Shukhov. It was built between 1919 and 1922 as a transmission tower for a Russian broadcasting company.<ref name="stako">{{cite web|url=http://www.stako.ru/static.php?&id=mem_shukhov&lang=eng&data=mem_shukhov |publisher=Melnikov Institute |title=Memorial |access-date=July 6, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527154019/http://www.stako.ru/static.php?&id=mem_shukhov&lang=eng&data=mem_shukhov |archive-date=May 27, 2008 }}</ref> Shukhov also left a lasting legacy to the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] architecture of early Soviet Russia.

Perhaps the most recognizable contributions of the Stalinist period are the so-called [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|Seven Sisters]], seven massive skyscrapers scattered throughout the city at about an equal distance from the Kremlin. A defining feature of Moscow's skyline, their imposing form was allegedly inspired by the [[Manhattan Municipal Building]] in [[New York City]], and their style—with intricate exteriors and a large central spire—has been described as [[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist Gothic architecture]]. All seven towers can be seen from most high points in the city; they are among the tallest constructions in central Moscow apart from the [[Ostankino Tower]], which, when it was completed in 1967, was the highest free-standing land structure in the world and today remains the world's seventy-second tallest, ranking among buildings such as the [[Burj Khalifa]] in Dubai, [[Taipei 101]] in Taiwan and the [[CN Tower]] in Toronto.<ref>[[List of tallest buildings in the world]]</ref>

The Soviet goal of providing housing for every family, and the rapid growth of Moscow's population, led to the construction of large, monotonous housing blocks. Most of these date from the post-Stalin era and the styles are often named after the leader then in power (Brezhnev, Khrushchev, etc.). They are usually badly maintained.

Although the city still has some five-story apartment buildings constructed before the mid-1960s, more recent apartment buildings are usually at least nine floors tall, and have [[elevator]]s. It is estimated that Moscow has over twice as many elevators as New York City and four times as many as [[Chicago]]. Moslift, one of the city's major elevator operating companies, has about 1500 elevator mechanics on call, to release residents trapped in elevators.<ref>{{citation

[[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist-era buildings]], mostly found in the central part of the city, are massive and usually ornamented with [[Socialist realism]] motifs that imitate [[classical architecture|classical]] themes. However, small churches—almost always [[Eastern Orthodox]]– found across the city provide glimpses of its past. The Old [[Arbat Street]], a tourist street that was once the heart of a bohemian area, preserves most of its buildings from prior to the 20th century. Many buildings found off the main streets of the inner city (behind the Stalinist [[façade]]s of [[Tverskaya Street]], for example) are also examples of [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] architecture typical of Tsarist times. [[Ostankino Palace]], [[Kuskovo]], [[Uzkoye]] and other large estates just outside Moscow originally belong to nobles from the Tsarist era, and some [[:Template: Cloisters of Moscow|convents, and monasteries]], both inside and outside the city, are open to Muscovites and tourists.

[[File:Москва, Россия (Unsplash -kgrPSetNW8).jpg|thumb|Modern methods of skyscraper construction were implemented in the city for the first time with the ambitious [[Moscow International Business Center|MIBC]].]]
Attempts are being made to restore many of the city's best-kept examples of pre-Soviet architecture. These restored structures are easily spotted by their bright new colors and spotless façades. There are a few examples of notable, early Soviet [[avant-garde]] work too, such as the house of the architect [[Konstantin Melnikov]] in the Arbat area. Many of these restorations were criticized for alleged disrespect of historical authenticity. [[Facadism]] is also widely practiced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maps-moscow.com/index.php?chapter_id=204&data_id=92&do=view_single |title=Moscow Architecture Preservation Society |publisher=Maps-moscow.com |date=April 17, 2006 |access-date=May 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111182743/http://www.maps-moscow.com/index.php?chapter_id=204&data_id=92&do=view_single |archive-date=January 11, 2008 }}</ref> Later examples of interesting Soviet architecture are usually marked by their impressive size and the semi-[[Modernist]] styles employed, such as with the [[Novy Arbat]] project, familiarly known as "false teeth of Moscow" and notorious for the wide-scale disruption of a historic area in central Moscow involved in the project.

Plaques on house exteriors will inform passers-by that a well-known personality once lived there. Frequently, the plaques are dedicated to Soviet celebrities not well known outside (or often, like with decorated generals and revolutionaries, now both inside) of Russia. There are also many "museum houses" of famous Russian writers, composers, and artists in the city.

Moscow's skyline is quickly modernizing, with several new towers under construction.
In recent years, the city administration has been widely criticized for heavy destruction that has affected many historical buildings.

== Moscow rings ==
Moscow's road system is centered roughly on the Kremlin at the heart of the city. From there, roads generally span outwards to intersect with a sequence of circular roads ("rings").

# The first and innermost major ring, Bulvarnoye Koltso ([[Boulevard Ring]]), was built at the former location of the 16th-century city wall around what used to be called [[Bely Gorod]] (White Town).<ref name="golden-ring">{{cite web|url=http://www.moscow-city.ru/download/source/Golden_Ring_Engl.pdf/8-11.pdf |title=Along the Moscow Golden Ring |publisher=Moscow, Russia Tourist Information center |access-date=July 5, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723084926/http://www.moscow-city.ru/download/source/Golden_Ring_Engl.pdf/8-11.pdf |archive-date=July 23, 2006 }}</ref> The Bulvarnoye Koltso is technically not a ring; it does not form a complete circle, but instead a [[horseshoe-shaped]] arc that begins at the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and ends at the [[Yauza River]].
# The second primary ring, located outside the Boulevard Ring, is the Sadovoye Koltso ([[Garden Ring]]). Like the Boulevard Ring, the Garden Ring follows the path of a 16th-century wall that used to encompass part of Moscow.<ref name="golden-ring" /> [[File:ISS-38 Nighttime image of Moscow, Russia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Moscow as viewed from the [[International Space Station]], January 29, 2014]]
# The [[Third Ring Road (Moscow)|Third Ring Road]], was completed in 2003 as a high-speed [[freeway]].
# The Fourth Transport Ring, another freeway, was planned, but cancelled in 2011. A system of chordal highways will replace it.

Aside from the aforementioned hierarchy, line 5 of [[Moscow Metro]] is a circle-shaped [[Loop line (railway)|looped]] subway line (hence the name ''Koltsevaya Liniya'', literally "ring line"), which is located between the ''Sadovoye Koltso'' and Third Transport Ring.

Two modern overlapping lines of Moscow Metro form "two hearts":
* Line 14. Since September 10, 2016, ''[[Moscow Central Circle]]'' renovated railroad (former ''Moskovskaya Okruzhnaya Zheleznaya Doroga'') was introduced as Line 14 of [[Moscow Metro]]. The cone-shaped railroad initially opened in 1908 (freight-only railway from 1934 until the 2016 reopening).
* Line 11. Another circle metro line - ''Big Circle Line'' (''[[Bolshaya Koltsevaya line|Bolshaya Koltsevaya Liniya]]'') is under construction and will be finished in 2023. [[Kakhovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Kakhovskaya]]-[[Savyolovskaya (Bolshaya Koltsevaya line)|Savyolovskaya]] western half of the line was launched in late 2021.

The outermost ring within Moscow is the [[Moscow Ring Road]] (often called ''MKAD'', acronym word for Russian ''Московская Кольцевая Автомобильная Дорога''), which forms the cultural boundary of the city, and was established in the 1950s. It is to note the method of building the road (usage of ground elevation instead of concrete columns throughout the whole way) formed a wall-like barrier that obstacles building roads under the MKAD highway itself).
* Before 2012 expansion of Moscow, MKAD was considered an approximate border for Moscow boundaries.

Outside Moscow, some of the roads encompassing the city continue to follow this circular pattern seen inside city limits, with the notable examples of ''Betonka'' roads (highways A107 and A108), originally made of concrete pads.

In order to reduce transit traffic on MKAD, the new ring road (called ''CKAD'' - ''Centralnaya Koltsevaya Avtomobilnaya Doroga'', ''Central Ring Road'') is now under construction beyond the MKAD.

One of the most notable art museums in Moscow is the [[Tretyakov Gallery]], which was founded by [[Pavel Tretyakov]], a wealthy patron of the arts who donated a large private collection to the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tretyakovgallery.ru/en/ |title=The Official site of the Tretyakov Gallery |publisher=Tretyakovgallery.ru |access-date=June 11, 2012 |archive-date=December 21, 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121221163028/http://www.tretyakovgallery.ru/en/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Tretyakov Gallery is split into two buildings. The Old Tretyakov gallery, the original gallery in the [[Tretyakov Gallery|Tretyakovskaya]] area on the south bank of the Moskva River, houses works in the classic Russian tradition.<ref name="trety">{{cite web|url=http://www.tretyakovgallery.ru/english/about.shtml |title=About The State Tretyakov Gallery |access-date=July 10, 2006 |publisher=The State Tretyakov Gallery |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927110355/http://www.tretyakovgallery.ru/english/about.shtml |archive-date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref> The works of famous pre-[[October Revolution|Revolutionary]] painters, such as [[Ilya Repin]], as well as the works of early Russian [[icon painting|icon painters]] can be found here.

The New Tretyakov gallery, created in Soviet times, mainly contains the works of Soviet artists, as well as of a few contemporary paintings, but there is some overlap with the Old Tretyakov Gallery for early 20th-century art. The new gallery includes a small reconstruction of [[Vladimir Tatlin]]'s famous ''[[Tatlin's Tower|Monument to the Third International]]'' and a mixture of other avant-garde works by artists like [[Kazimir Malevich]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. Socialist realism features can also be found within the halls of the New Tretyakov Gallery.

Another art museum in the city of Moscow is the [[Pushkin Museum|Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts]], which was founded by, among others, the father of [[Marina Tsvetaeva]]. The Pushkin Museum is similar to the [[British Museum]] in London in that its halls are a cross-section of exhibits on world civilisations, with many copies of ancient sculptures. However, it also hosts paintings from every major Western era; works by [[Claude Monet]], [[Paul Cézanne]], and [[Pablo Picasso]] are present in the museum's collection.

The [[State Historical Museum]] of Russia (Государственный Исторический музей) is a museum of Russian history located between Red Square and [[Manezhnaya Square, Moscow|Manege Square]] in Moscow.

Moscow houses other prominent football, ice hockey, and basketball teams. Because sports organisations in the Soviet Union were once highly centralized, two of the best Union-level teams represented defence and law-enforcing agencies: the Armed Forces ([[CSKA Moscow|CSKA]]) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs ([[Dynamo Sports Club|Dinamo]]). There were army and police teams in most major cities. As a result, Spartak, CSKA, and Dinamo were among the best-funded teams in the USSR.

The entire city of Moscow is headed by one mayor ([[Sergey Sobyanin]]). The city of Moscow is divided into twelve administrative okrugs and 125 districts.

The Russian capital's town-planning development began to show as early as the 12th century when the city was founded. The central part of Moscow grew by consolidating with suburbs in line with medieval principles of urban development when strong fortress walls would gradually spread along the circle streets of adjacent new settlements. The first circular defence walls set the trajectory of Moscow's rings, laying the groundwork for the future planning of the Russian capital.

The following fortifications served as the city's circular defense boundaries at some point in history: the Kremlin walls, Zemlyanoy Gorod (Earthwork Town), the Kamer-Kollezhsky Rampart, the Garden Ring, and the small railway ring. The Moscow Ring Road (MKAD) has been Moscow's boundary since 1960. Also in the form of a circle are the main Moscow subway line, the Ring Line, and the so-called Third Automobile Ring, which was completed in 2005. Hence, the characteristic radial-circle planning continues to define Moscow's further development. However, contemporary Moscow has also engulfed a number of territories outside the MKAD, such as Solntsevo, Butovo, and the town of [[Zelenograd]]. A part of [[Moscow Oblast]]'s territory was merged into Moscow on July 1, 2012; as a result, Moscow is no longer fully surrounded by Moscow Oblast and now also has a border with [[Kaluga Oblast]].<ref name="Merger">Official website of the Government of Moscow. [http://www.mos.ru/about/borders/ Draft of adopted measures of the capital and oblast governments with regards to the expansion of the borders of Moscow] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821063010/http://www.mos.ru/about/borders/ |date=August 21, 2011 }} {{in lang|ru}}</ref> In all, Moscow gained about {{convert|1500|km2|sp=us}} and 230,000 inhabitants. Moscow's Mayor Sergey Sobyanin lauded the expansion that will help Moscow and the neighboring region, a "mega-city" of twenty million people, to develop "harmonically".<ref name="Merger2"/>

All administrative okrugs and districts have their own [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] and flags as well as individual heads of the area.

In addition to the districts, there are Territorial Units with Special Status. These usually include areas with small or no permanent populations. Such is the case with the All-Russia Exhibition Centre, the [[Moscow Botanical Garden of Academy of Sciences|Botanical Garden]], large parks, and industrial zones. In recent years, some territories have been merged with different districts. There are no ethnic-specific regions in Moscow, as in the [[Chinatown]]s that exist in some [[North America]]n and [[East Asia]]n cities. And although districts are not designated by income, as with most cities, those areas that are closer to the city center, metro stations or green zones are considered more prestigious.<ref>{{cite web|script-title=ru:Цены на Квартиры в Москве по Административным Районам и Станциям Метро|url=http://www.metrinfo.ru/area/|work=Metrinfo.ru|access-date=September 27, 2010|language=ru|archive-date=December 27, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227235220/http://www.metrinfo.ru/area/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Moscow also hosts some of the government bodies of [[Moscow Oblast]], although the city itself is not a part of the oblast.<ref name="MoscowO">According to Article 24 of the Charter of Moscow Oblast, the government bodies of the oblast are located in the city of Moscow and throughout the territory of Moscow Oblast. However, Moscow is not officially named the administrative centre of the oblast.</ref>

[[Private ownership]] of apartments was limited until the 1990s when people were permitted to secure property rights to their inhabited places.

===Public utilities===
The heating of buildings in Moscow, like in other cities in Russia is done using [[District heating|central heating system]]. Before 2004, state [[unitary enterprise]]s were responsible to produce and supply heat to the clients by the operation of heating stations and heating distribution system of Mosgorteplo, Mosteploenergo, and Teploremontnaladka which gave service to the [[District heating substation|heating substations]] in the [[Administrative divisions of Moscow|north-eastern part]] of the city. Clients were divided between the various enterprises based on their geographical location. A major reform launched in 2004 consolidated the various companies under the umbrella of MIPC which became the municipal heat supplier. Its subsidiaries were the newly transformed Joint-stock companies. The city's main source of heating is the power station of Mosenergo which was reformed in 2005, when around ten subsidiaries were separated from it. One of the newly independent companies was the District Heating Network Company (MTK) ({{langx|ru|Московская теплосетевая компания}}). In 2007 the [[Government of Moscow]] bought controlling stakes in the company.<ref>[Andrey Kovalev, Liliana Proskuryakova.

Although Moscow has a number of famous Soviet-era higher educational institutions, most of which are more oriented towards engineering or the fundamental sciences, in recent years Moscow has seen a growth in the number of commercial and private institutions that offer classes in business and management. Many state institutions have expanded their education scope and introduced new courses or departments. Institutions in Moscow, as well as the rest of post-Soviet Russia, have begun to offer new international certificates and postgraduate degrees, including the [[Master of Business Administration]]. [[Student exchange program]]s with numerous countries, specially with the rest of Europe, have also become widespread in Moscow's universities, while schools within the Russian capital also offer seminars, lectures, and courses for corporate employees and businessmen.

The [[Moscow Metro]] system is famous for its art, [[mural]]s, [[mosaic]]s, and ornate [[chandelier]]s. It started operation in 1935 and immediately became the centrepiece of the transportation system. More than that it was a Stalinist device to awe and reward the populace, and give them an appreciation of Soviet realist art. It became the prototype for future Soviet large-scale technologies. [[Lazar Kaganovich]] was in charge; he designed the subway so that citizens would absorb the values and ethos of Stalinist civilisation as they rode. The artwork of the 13 original stations became nationally and internationally famous. For example, the Sverdlov Square subway station featured porcelain bas-reliefs depicting the daily life of the Soviet peoples, and the bas-reliefs at the Dynamo Stadium sports complex glorified sports and the physical prowess of the powerful new "Homo Sovieticus" (Soviet man).<ref>[[Isabel Wünsche]], "Homo Sovieticus: The Athletic Motif in the Design of the Dynamo Metro Station", ''Studies in the Decorative Arts'' (2000) 7#2 pp. 65–90</ref>

The metro was touted as the symbol of the new social order—a sort of Communist cathedral of engineering modernity.<ref>Andrew Jenks, "A Metro on the Mount", ''Technology & Culture'' (2000) 41#4 pp. 697–723</ref> Soviet workers did the labour and the artwork, but the main engineering designs, routes, and construction plans were handled by specialists recruited from the London Underground. The Britons called for tunneling instead of the "cut-and-cover" technique, the use of escalators instead of lifts, and designed the routes and the rolling stock.<ref>Michael Robbins, "London Underground and Moscow Metro", ''Journal of Transport History'', (1997) 18#1 pp. 45–53.</ref> The paranoia of Stalin and the NKVD was evident when the secret police arrested numerous British engineers for espionage—that is for gaining an in-depth knowledge of the city's physical layout. Engineers for the Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Company were given a show trial and deported in 1933, ending the role of British business in the USSR.<ref>Gordon W. Morrell, "Redefining Intelligence and Intelligence-Gathering: The Industrial Intelligence Centre and the Metro-Vickers Affair, Moscow 1933", ''Intelligence and National Security'' (1994) 9#3 pp. 520–533.</ref>

Today, the Moscow Metro comprises twelve lines, mostly underground with a total of 203 stations. The Metro is one of the deepest subway systems in the world; for instance, the [[Park Pobedy (Moscow Metro)|Park Pobedy]] station, completed in 2003, at {{convert|84|m}} underground, has the longest escalators in Europe. The Moscow Metro is the busiest metro system in Europe, as well as [[Metro systems by annual passenger rides|one of the world's busiest]] metro systems, serving about ten million passengers daily (300,000,000 people every month).<ref name="metro">{{cite web|url=http://www.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=99|language=ru|script-title=ru:Московский метрополитен|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714154607/http://www.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=99|archive-date=July 14, 2006|access-date=July 4, 2006}}</ref> Facing serious transportation problems, Moscow has plans for expanding its Metro.

Due to the treatment of Metro stations as possible canvas for art, characterized by the fact that workers of Moscow would get to see them every day, many Stalin-era metro stations were built in different "custom" designs (where each station's design would be, initially, a massive installation on a certain theme. For example, [[Elektrozavodskaya (Arbatsko–Pokrovskaya line)|Elektrozavodskaya]] station was themed solely after nearby lightbulb factory and ceramic ribbed lightbulb sockets);<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.railway-technology.com/features/moscow-metro-stations/|title=The people's palace: exploring Moscow Metro's evolving designs|work=RailwayTechnology|date=December 10, 2018|access-date=September 30, 2020|archive-date=October 2, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201002221948/https://www.railway-technology.com/features/moscow-metro-stations/|url-status=live}}</ref> the tradition of "Grand Designs" and, basically, decorating metro stations as single-themed installations, was restored in late 1979.

As Metro stations outside the city center are far apart in comparison to other cities, up to {{convert|4|km}}, a bus network radiates from each station to the surrounding residential zones.

Every major street in the city is served by at least one bus route. Many of these routes are doubled by a [[trolleybus]] route and have trolley wires over them.

With the total line length of almost {{convert|600|km|abbr=off}} of a single wire, 8 depots, 104 routes, and 1740 vehicles, the Moscow trolleybus system was the [[Trolleybus usage by country|largest in the world]]. But municipal authority, headed by Sergey Sobyanin, began to destroy the trolleybus system in Moscow in 2014 due the planned replacement of trolleybuses by electric buses. In 2018 Moscow trolleybus system has only 4 depots and dozens of kilometers of unused wires. Almost all trolleybus wires inside Garden Ring (Sadovoe Koltso) were cut in 2016–2017 due to the reconstruction of central streets ("Moya Ulitsa"). Opened on November 15, 1933, it is also the world's 6th oldest operating trolleybus system.

In 2018 the vehicle companies [[Kamaz]] and [[GAZ]] have won the [[Mosgortrans]] tender for delivering 200 [[electric bus]]es and 62 ultra-fast charging stations to the city transport system. The manufacturers will be responsible for the quality and reliable operation of the buses and charging stations for the next 15 years. The city will be procuring only electric buses as of 2021, replacing the diesel bus fleet gradually. According to expectations, Moscow will become the leader amongst the European cities in terms of electric and gas fuel share in public transport by 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rusautonews.com/2018/09/04/first-electric-buses-have-started-operating-in-moscow-in-regular-transport|title=First electric buses have started operating in Moscow in regular transport|date=September 4, 2018|access-date=September 28, 2018|archive-date=September 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929000432/http://rusautonews.com/2018/09/04/first-electric-buses-have-started-operating-in-moscow-in-regular-transport/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Moscow cable car===

[[File:Moscow Cable Car.jpg|thumb|Cable cars passing across the [[Moskva River]] and the [[Luzhniki Stadium]]]]
On November 26, 2018, the [[mayor of Moscow]] [[Sergey Sobyanin]] took part in the ceremony to open the [[Moskva River cable car|cable car]] above the [[Moskva River]]. The cable car will connect the [[Luzhniki Olympic Complex|Luzhniki sports complex]] with [[Sparrow Hills]] and Kosygin Street. The journey from the well-known viewpoint on Vorobyovy Gory to [[Luzhniki Stadium]] will last for five minutes instead of 20 minutes that one would have to spend on the same journey by car.

===Tram===
{{Main|Trams in Moscow}}
[[File:Moscow TverZastava Vityaz asv2018-09.jpg|thumb|left|A Vityaz-M tram passing by the [[Tverskaya Zastava Square]]]]

Moscow has an extensive tram system, which first opened in 1899.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://moscowseasons.com/en/news/the-long-trip-to-vityaz-or-the-story-of-the-moscow-tram-system/|title=The long trip to Vityaz or the story of the Moscow tram system|website=MoscowSeasons|date=September 22, 2018|access-date=March 29, 2020|archive-date=March 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329113420/https://moscowseasons.com/en/news/the-long-trip-to-vityaz-or-the-story-of-the-moscow-tram-system/|url-status=dead}}</ref> The newest line was built in 1984. Its daily usage by Muscovites is low, making up for approximately 5% of trips because many vital connections in the network have been withdrawn. Trams still remain important in some districts as feeders to Metro stations. The trams also provide important cross-links between metro lines, for example between [[Universitet (Moscow Metro)|Universitet station]] of [[Sokolnicheskaya Line]] (#1 red line) and [[Profsoyuznaya (Moscow Metro)|Profsoyuznaya station]] of [[Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line]] (#6 orange line) or between [[Voykovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Voykovskaya]] and [[Strogino (Moscow Metro)|Strogino]].
[[File:Moscow tram map 2022-04.svg|thumb|Tram map of Moscow]]
There are three tram networks in the city:

* Krasnopresnenskoye depot network with the westernmost point at Strogino (depot location) and the easternmost point near platform Dmitrovskaya. This network became separated in 1973, but until 1997 it could easily have been reconnected by about {{convert|1|km|chain|0|spell=on|abbr=off}} of track and three switches. The network has the highest usage in Moscow and no weak points based on turnover except to-depot lane (passengers serviced by bus) and tram ring at Dmitrovskaya (because now it is neither a normal transfer point nor a repair terminal).
* The Apakov depot services the south-western part from the Varshavsky lane – Simferopolsky boulevard in the east to the Universitet station in the west and Boulevard lane at the center. This network is connected only by the four-way Dubininskaya and Kozhevnicheskaya streets. A second connection by Vostochnaya (Eastern) street was withdrawn in 1987 due to a fire at the Dinamo plant and has not been recovered, and remains lost (Avtozavodsky bridge) at 1992. The network may be serviced anyway by another depot (now route 35, 38).
* Main three depot networks with railway gate and tram-repair plant.

In addition, tram advocates have suggested that the new rapid transit services (metro to City, Butovo light metro, Monorail) would be more effective as at-grade tram lines and that the problems with trams are only due to poor management and operation, not the technical properties of trams. New tram models have been developed for the Moscow network despite the lack of expansion.

===Taxi===
Commercial taxi services and [[route taxi]]s are in widespread use. In the mid-2010s, service platforms such as [[Yandex.Taxi]], [[Uber]] and [[Gett]] displaced many private drivers and small service providers and were in 2015 servicing more than 50% of all taxi orders in Moscow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://top.rbc.ru/money/20/07/2015/55ad01229a794778050020f6|title=Гонки на такси: на чем быстрее и дешевле ездить|work=rbc.ru|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724134238/http://top.rbc.ru/money/20/07/2015/55ad01229a794778050020f6|archive-date=July 24, 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://i.rbc.ru/publication/analytic/otsifrovannye_shashki_kak_tehnologii_perekroili Оцифрованные шашки: как технологии перекроили рынок такси / РБК Инновации<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150805050244/http://i.rbc.ru/publication/analytic/otsifrovannye_shashki_kak_tehnologii_perekroili|date=August 5, 2015}}</ref>

===Railway===
[[File:Komsomolskaya square as seen from Leningradskaya hotel in winter (2014) -Вид на Комсомольскую площадь из гостиницы Ленинградская - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Komsomolskaya Square (Moscow)|Komsomolskaya Square]] known as "Three Station Square" thanks to three ornate rail terminal situated there: [[Moscow Passazhirskaya railway station|Leningradsky]], [[Moscow Yaroslavskaya railway station|Yaroslavsky]], and [[Moscow Kazanskaya railway station|Kazansky]].]] Several train stations serve the city. Moscow's ten rail terminals (or {{transliteration|ru|vokzals}}) are:

*[[Belorussky Rail Terminal]]
*[[Kazansky Rail Terminal]]
*[[Kiyevsky Rail Terminal]]
*[[Kursky Rail Terminal]]
*[[Leningradsky Rail Terminal]]
*[[Paveletsky Rail Terminal]]
*[[Rizhsky Rail Terminal]]
*[[Savyolovsky Rail Terminal]]
*[[Yaroslavsky Rail Terminal]]
*[[Vostochny Railway Terminal (Moscow)|Vostochny railway Terminal]]

[[File:Bullet-Train.jpg|thumb|The high-speed [[Sapsan]] train links Moscow with [[Saint Petersburg]].]]
The terminals are located close to the city center, along with the metro ringline 5 or close to it, and connect to a metro line to the centre of town. Each station handles trains from different parts of Europe and Asia.<ref name="mostimestrain">{{cite news |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/travel/arriving/bytrain.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708154220/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/travel/arriving/bytrain.html|archive-date=July 8, 2006|newspaper=The Moscow Times|title=Getting to Russia: Arriving by Train|access-date=July 3, 2006}}</ref> There are many smaller railway stations in Moscow. As train tickets are cheap, they are the preferred mode of travel for Russians, especially when departing to Saint Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city. Moscow is the western terminus of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], which traverses nearly {{convert|9300|km}} of Russian territory to [[Vladivostok]] on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast.

Suburbs and satellite cities are connected by commuter [[elektrichka]] (electric rail) network. Elektrichkas depart from each of these terminals to the nearby (up to {{convert|140|km|mi|0|disp=or|abbr=on}}) large railway stations.

During the 2010s, the [[Little Ring of the Moscow Railway]] was converted to be used for frequent passenger service; it is fully integrated with Moscow Metro; the passenger service started on September 10, 2016. A connecting railway line on the North side of the town connects Belorussky terminal with other railway lines. This is used by some suburban trains.

==== Moscow Central Circle ====
[[File:MCC_12LUZH_7041_PLAT.jpg|thumb|left|"Lastochka" train on "[[Luzhniki (Moscow Central Circle)|Luzhniki]]" station (Line 14)]]
The [[Little Ring of the Moscow Railway|Moskovskaya Okruzhnaya Zheleznaya Doroga]] formed a ring around the now-downtown Moscow since 1903, but only served as a non-electrified, fueled locomotive-only railway prior to reconstruction into MCC in 2010's.

The [[Moscow Central Circle]] is a {{convert|54|km|mi|adj = mid|-long}} [[Urban rail transit|urban-metro railway]] orbital line that encircles historical Moscow. It was built alongside [[Little Ring of the Moscow Railway]], taking some of its tracks into itself as well. M.C.C. was opened for passenger use on September 10, 2016.

The line is operated by the [[Moscow Government]] owned company MKZD through the [[Moscow Metro]], with the [[Government of Russia|Federal Government]] owned [[Russian Railways]] selected as the operation subcontractor.

==== Moscow Central Diameters ====

[[File:Moscow Central Diameters - passenger scheme1.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[Moscow Central Diameters]]]]
Another system, which forms "genuine ''S-Bahn''" as in "suburbia-city-suburbia"-designed railway, is the [[Moscow Central Diameters]], a pass-through railways system, created by constructing bypasses from "vokzals" final stations (e.g. by avoiding the central stations of already existing Moscow Railway, used for both intercity and urban-suburban travel before)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.railway-technology.com/news/moscow-central-diameters-opened-public/|title=Moscow Central Diameters, Russia, opens to the public|date=November 25, 2019|access-date=December 24, 2019|archive-date=December 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191224183501/https://www.railway-technology.com/news/moscow-central-diameters-opened-public/|url-status=live}}</ref> and forming a train line across Moscow's centre.

Out of 5 projected lines, the first 2 lines were completed and launched on 2019-11-21.

===Roads===
[[File:Площадь Тверская Застава (вид сверху).jpg|thumb|Intersection at [[Tverskaya Zastava Square]]]]
There are over 2.6 million cars in the city daily. Recent years have seen growth in the number of cars, which have caused traffic jams and lack of parking space to become major problems.

The Moscow Ring Road (MKAD), along with the [[Third Ring Road (Moscow)|Third Transport Ring]] and the canceled Fourth Transport Ring, is one of only three freeways that run within Moscow city limits. Several other roadway systems form [[concentric circles]] around the city.

===Air===
There are five primary commercial airports serving Moscow: [[Sheremetyevo International Airport|Sheremetyevo]] (SVO), [[Domodedovo International Airport|Domodedovo]] (DME), [[Vnukovo International Airport|Vnukovo]] (VKO), [[Zhukovsky International Airport|Zhukovsky]] (ZIA), [[Ostafyevo International Airport|Ostafyevo]] (OSF).

Sheremetyevo International Airport is the most globally connected of Moscow's airports, handling 60% of all international flights.<ref name="4airports">{{cite news|url=http://www.go-russia.com/angela.php|title=Moscow Airports|date=October 7, 2007|access-date=October 7, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011092857/http://go-russia.com/angela.php|archive-date=October 11, 2007|publisher=Go-Russia}}</ref> It is also a home to all [[SkyTeam]] members, and the main hub for [[Aeroflot]] (itself a member of SkyTeam). Domodedovo International Airport is the leading airport in Russia in terms of passenger throughput and is the primary gateway to long-haul domestic and CIS destinations and its international traffic rivals Sheremetyevo. It is a hub for [[S7 airlines]], and most of [[OneWorld]] and [[Star Alliance]] members use Domodedovo as their international hub. Vnukovo International Airport handles flights of [[Turkish Airlines]], [[Wizz Air Abu Dhabi]] and others. Ostafyevo International Airport caters primarily to business aviation.

Moscow's airports vary in distances from the MKAD beltway: Domodedovo is the farthest at {{convert|22|km|0|abbr=on}}; Vnukovo is {{convert|11|km|0|abbr=on}}; Sheremetyevo is {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}}; and Ostafievo, the nearest, is about {{convert|8|km|mi}} from MKAD.<ref name="4airports"/>

There are a number of smaller airports close to Moscow (19 in Moscow Oblast) such as [[Myachkovo Airport]], that are intended for private aircraft, helicopters and charters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sostav.ru/news/2004/08/18/72/|title=Аэропорт сменил хозяев.

===Water===
Moscow has two passenger terminals, ([[South River Terminal]] and [[North River Terminal]]), on the river and regular ship routes and cruises along the [[Moskva River|Moskva]] and [[Oka River|Oka]] rivers, which are used mostly for entertainment. The [[North River Terminal]], built in 1937, is the main hub for long-range river routes. There are three freight ports serving Moscow.

Moscow has different vehicle sharing options that are sponsored by the local government. There are several [[car sharing]] companies which are in charge of providing cars to the population. To drive the automobiles, the user has to book them through the app of the owning company. In 2018 the mayor [[Sergey Sobyanin]] said Moscow's car sharing system has become the biggest in Europe in terms of vehicle fleet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2018/03/09/moscows-car-sharing-market-becomes-biggest-in-europe-mayor-says-a60762|title=Moscow's Car Sharing Market Becomes Biggest in Europe, Mayor Says|date=March 9, 2018|website=[[The Moscow Times]]|access-date=April 21, 2019|archive-date=April 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421134424/https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2018/03/09/moscows-car-sharing-market-becomes-biggest-in-europe-mayor-says-a60762|url-status=live}}</ref> Every day about 25,000 people use this service.

In 1992, the Moscow government began planning a projected new part of central Moscow, the [[Moscow International Business Center]], with the goal of creating a zone, the first in Russia, and in all of Eastern Europe,<ref>{{cite news|date=December 23, 2005|script-title=ru:Москва-Сити начинается строительство Города столиц|language=ru|agency=Lenta.ru|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2005/12/23/city/|access-date=May 24, 2009|archive-date=June 22, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622153322/http://www.lenta.ru/news/2005/12/23/city/|url-status=live}}</ref> that will combine business activity, living space and entertainment. Situated in [[Presnensky District]] and located at the Third Ring, the Moscow City area is under intense development. The construction of the MIBC takes place on the Krasnopresnenskaya embankment. The whole project takes up to {{convert|1|km2|acre|spell=in|abbr=off}}. The area is the only spot in downtown Moscow that can accommodate a project of this magnitude. Today, most of the buildings there are old factories and industrial complexes.

The [[Federation Tower]], completed in 2016, is the [[List of tallest buildings in Europe|second-tallest building in Europe]]. It is planned to include a [[water park]] and other recreational facilities; business, office, entertainment, and residential buildings, a transport network and a [[City Hall and City Duma|new site for the Moscow government]]. The construction of four new metro stations in the territory has been completed, two of which have opened and two others are reserved for future metro lines crossing MIBC, some additional stations were planned. 
* A rail shuttle service, directly connecting [[Moscow International Business Center|MIBC]] with the [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]] is also planned.

Major thoroughfares through MIBC are the [[Third Ring Road (Moscow)|Third Ring]] and [[Kutuzovsky Prospekt]].

Three metro stations were initially planned for the [[Filyovskaya Line]]. The station Delovoi Tsentr opened in 2005 and was later renamed [[Vystavochnaya]] in 2009. The branch extended to the [[Mezhdunarodnaya (Moscow Metro)|Mezhdunarodnaya]] station in 2006, and all work on the third station, Dorogomilovskaya (between [[Kiyevskaya (Filyovskaya)|Kiyevskaya]] and Delovoi Tsentr), has been postponed. There are plans to extend the branch as far as the [[Savyolovskaya (Serpukhovsko–Timiryazevskaya line)|Savyolovskaya]] station, on the [[Serpukhovsko-Timiryazevskaya Line]].

The cellphone service provider MTS announced on March 5, 2021, that they would begin the country's first pilot [[5G]] network in Moscow.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/03/05/russias-mts-launches-pilot-5g-network-in-moscow-hotspots-a73164 |title=Russia's MTS Launches Pilot 5G Network in Moscow Hotspots |work=Moscow Times |date=March 5, 2021 |access-date=September 27, 2021 |archive-date=October 25, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211025010605/https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/03/05/russias-mts-launches-pilot-5g-network-in-moscow-hotspots-a73164 |url-status=live }}</ref>
