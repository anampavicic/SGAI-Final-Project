==History==
===Ancient prior settlement===

The rough area of the city has been inhabited for millennia.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Макіївка, Донецька область |url=https://ukrssr.com.ua/donetska/makiyivka-donetska-oblast |access-date=2023-09-25 |language=uk}}</ref> [[Kurgan]]s from the [[Bronze Age]], [[Scythian]] civilization, and the 800s-1200s AD have been excavated in the surrounding area.<ref name=EOU/>

===Founding===
The original village of Makiivka first appears in historical documents in 1777.<ref name=EOU>{{Cite web |title=Makiivka |url=https://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CM%5CA%5CMakiivka.htm |access-date=2023-09-25 |website=Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine}}</ref> In 1875–1877, several minor mines were opened nearby.<ref name=EOU/> In 1899, a metallurgical settlement was founded nearby called Dmitriyevsk (Dmytriyivsk), named after Dmitry Ilovaisky, son of [[Ilovaysky|count Ilovaysky]] - the landlord of the region.{{cn|date=September 2023}} Makiivka was only a small village when it was combined with nearby Dmytriivsk. Dmytriivsk subsequently developed as one of the largest coal-mining and industrial centres of the [[Donets Basin]] coalfield. In 1931, Dmytriivsk was renamed Makiivka.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Makiyivka|title=Makiyivka|website=britannica.com|access-date=2023-03-24|archive-date=2023-12-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231209055936/https://www.britannica.com/place/Makiyivka|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:ЯКХЗ4.JPG|thumb|Yasynivka coke plant near Makiivka]]
[[File:The Soviet Union 1947 CPA 1222 stamp (Kirov foundry. Makeevka).jpg|thumb|Kirov Foundry, Makeevka on a 1947 stamp]]
There are many coal mines in and around the city. Makiivka's modern industries include one of the largest integrated [[iron]] and [[steel]] works in [[Ukraine]]. There are also other [[metalworking]] and [[Cracking (chemistry)|coke-chemical]] plants and factories for [[pneumatic machinery]], [[shoemaking]], and food processing. The city is rather dispersed, with numerous residential communities surrounding individual industrial plants over an extensive area. It is gradually extending to form a single metropolitan area with the nearby city of [[Donetsk]], which lies just a few miles to the southwest. Makiivka is home to the [[Donbas National Academy of Civil Engineering and Architecture]].

The largest enterprises in Makiivka are: State enterprise "Makeyevugol" - open joint-stock company "Makeyevsky Metallurgical Works" - open joint-stock company, "Yasinovsky Coke-chemical Plant", and the limited company "Makeyevcoke".

There are also many machine-building enterprises within the city, with the most significant being: open joint-stock company "Granit", open joint-stock company "Stroymash", and the closed joint-stock company "Makeyevsky Mine's Automatic Machinery plant".

====Makiivka metallurgical plant====
The Makiivka metallurgical plant produced 1.029 million tons of [[steel]] and 825,000 tons of [[pig iron]] in 2005. It increased production of rolled steel 1.56-fold to over 700,000 tons in the January–July period of 2006, compared with the corresponding period of last year. It aims to increase its sales revenues to ₴1.265 billion in 2006. The [[Nucor]] company ([[United States]]) intends to sign a contract with the Makiivka metallurgical plant on delivery of [[pig iron]] to the company's enterprises in the [[United States]].
