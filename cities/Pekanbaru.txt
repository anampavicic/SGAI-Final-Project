'''Pekanbaru''' is the capital city of the Indonesian province [[Riau]], and a major economic center on the eastern side of [[Sumatra|Sumatra Island]] with its name derived from the [[Malay language|Malay]] words for 'new market' ('pekan' is market and 'baru' is new).
It has an area of {{cvt|632.26|km2}}, with a population of 897,767 at the 2010 Census, and 983,356 at the 2020 Census;<ref name="bps.go.id">{{cite web |url=http://pekanbarukota.bps.go.id/index.php?hal=tabel&id=18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119063004/http://pekanbarukota.bps.go.id/index.php?hal=tabel&id=18 |archive-date=19 January 2015 |title=BPS Kota Pekanbaru}}</ref><ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 1,123,348 (comprising 564,628 males and 558,720 females).<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Pekanbaru Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.1471)</ref> It is located on the banks of the [[Siak River]], which flows into the [[Strait of Malacca]], Pekanbaru has direct access to the busy strait and has long been known as a trading port.

A settlement has existed on the site since the 17th century. In the late 19th century, the city was developed to serve the coffee and coal industries, and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] built roads to help ship goods to [[Singapore]] and [[Malacca]]. This city has an airport called [[Sultan Syarif Kasim II International Airport]], and a port called Sungai Duku that is located by the Siak River.

==Etymology==
The words "pekan" (market) and "baru" (new) in the [[Malay language|Malay]] for "new market" are the source of the names Pekanbaru and Pekan Baru. Pekanbaru is used to be known as "new market" because back then Pekanbaru was a huge market which is known among the surrounding areas. It was formerly known as "Senapelan", which comes from the word "Sena" which is the name of a tree that symbolises Pekanbaru because the tree is easy to spot because of its considerable height and the tree was on a hill. Batin was the tribe chief at the time. In which around this time, this area transforms into Dusun Payung Sekaki, which is situated near the mouth of the Siak River, as it continues to grow into a new urban residential area.

According to the records kept by Imam Suhil Siak, Sultan Muhammad Ali Abdul Jalil Muazamsyah under the rule of Sultan Yahya officially established Senapelan on the 21st of Rajab, Tuesday, in the year 1204 H, corresponding to the 23rd of June 1784 AD, which was later set as the day of Pekanbaru City. Senapelan was later more commonly known as Pekanbaru.

==History==
On 14 December 1745, the Siak region was ceded by the Sultan of Johor [[Sulaiman Badrul Alam Shah of Johor|Sulaiman Badrul Alam Shah]] from the [[Johor Sultanate]] to the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) under the terms of a treaty in return for Dutch help against the enemies of Johor.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Winstedt |first=R. O. |url=https://archive.org/details/dli.ernet.240629/page/5/mode/2up?view=theater |title=Journal Of The Malayan Branch Of The Royal Asiatic Society Vol: XI |date=1933 |publisher=The Malayan Branch Of The Royal Asiatic Society |location=Singapore |pages=5 |language=en}}</ref> Siak was put under Dutch administration. The Sultan moved residence to a palace in Senapelan built in 1760.

The origin of Pekanbaru was inseparable from the existence of the Siak River as a distributing route for commodities from the [[Minangkabau Highlands]] to the [[Strait of Malacca]]. During the 18th century, the Senapelan region on the banks of the Siak River became a market for the Minangkabau merchants.<ref>Sejarah Daerah Riau, Proyek Penelitian dan Pencatatan Kebudayaan Daerah, Pusat Penelitian Sejarah dan Budaya, Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, 1977</ref> Over time, the area evolved into a crowded residential area. On June 23, 1784, based on the consultative meeting of the Council of Ministers from [[Sultanate of Siak Sri Indrapura]], consisting of four tribal leaders (''datuk'') of Minangkabau tribes (Pesisir, Lima Puluah, Tanah Datar and Kampar), the area was named Pekanbaru. This date was later celebrated as the anniversary of this city.<ref>{{cite book|last=Samin|first=S.M.|title=Dari kebatinan senapelan ke Bandaraya Pekanbaru: menelisik jejak sejarah Kota Pekanbaru, 1784-2005|year=2006|publisher=Pemerintah Kota Pekanbaru bekerjasama dengan Masyarakat Sejarawan Indonesia (MSI) Cabang Riau dan Penerbit Alaf Riau}}</ref><ref name="sejarah">{{cite web |title=Sejarah Pekanbaru |url=http://www.pekanbaru.go.id/sejarah-pekanbaru/ |publisher=Pemda kota Pekanbaru |access-date=1 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414112818/http://www.pekanbaru.go.id/sejarah-pekanbaru |archive-date=14 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Studioportret van de Sultan van Siak met zijn echtgenote TMnr 60003230.jpg|thumb|right|Sultan Syarif Kasim II of Siak and his wife, 1910–1920. The last Sultan of Siak who ceded his kingdom to the Republic of Indonesia]]

At Senapelan Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah Alamudin unsuccessfully tried to organize a major regional fair but in the early 1780s his son Sultan Muhammad Ali managed to establish the grand fair.

===Dutch East Indies===
Following the collapse of the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC), all company ownership of Pekanbaru was transferred to the Dutch crown. During the colonial [[Dutch East Indies]] era in the 19th and early 20th century the city remained important, especially as a major trading point: Siak river navigation conditions provide a stable relationship with shipping from the Malacca Strait. Additionally the city became a major center of the coffee industry and coal industry. The urban influence of the sultans gradually became increasingly nominal, especially after the capital of the Sultanate moved to [[Sultanate of Siak Sri Indrapura|Sri Indrapura]] in 1830. Actual management functions were carried out by representatives of the Dutch colonial administration, i.e., by the post of assistant-resident and controller.

===Second World War===
During the Second World War from February 1942 to August 1945 the city was [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|occupied]] by the armed forces of Japan. In an effort to strengthen the military and logistical infrastructure in this part of Sumatra, the Japanese started the construction of a 220-kilometer-long railway, connecting Pekanbaru to the coast of [[Malacca Straits]].

The [[Pekanbaru Railway]] was constructed under harsh conditions using forced labour. 6,500 Dutch, mostly [[Indo people|Indo-Europeans]], and British prisoners of war and over 100,000 Indonesian, mostly Javanese, forced workers called ''[[Romusha]]'' were put to work by the Japanese army. By the time the work was completed in August 1945 almost a third of the European POWs and over half of the Indonesian coolies had died.<ref>[http://www.radionetherlandsarchives.org/traces-of-war-survivors-of-the-burma-and-pakanbaroe-railroad/ "Traces of War: Survivors of the Burma and Pakanbaroe Railroad", Radio Netherlands Archives, August 13, 2003]</ref>

George Duffy, one of the 15 Americans there and survivor of the sinking of the {{MS|American Leader}}, noted that [[malaria]], [[dysentery]], [[pellagra]], and malnutrition/[[beri-beri]] were the principal maladies compounded by overwork and mistreatment. The average age at death of the 700 prisoners of war who perished on that railway was 37 years and 3 months.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.memoryarchive.org/en/The_Death_Railway,_April_1945,_by_George_Duffy| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080618213017/http://www.memoryarchive.org/en/The_Death_Railway,_April_1945,_by_George_Duffy | title=The Death Railway, April 1945| archive-date=18 June 2008 |url-status=dead | work=[[MemoryArchive]] | date=5 January 2006 | access-date=2 January 2015 | author=Duffy, George}}</ref>

The railway was never fully utilised. Today it remains unused and in an advanced state of decay.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hovinga|first=Henk|author-link=Henk Hovinga|title=The Sumatra Railroad: Final Destination Pakan Baroe 1943-45|year=2010|publisher=[[KITLV Press]]|location=Leiden|isbn=9789067183284}}</ref>

===Indonesian era===
After [[Indonesian independence]], Pekanbaru was organized as an administrative city in 1956, and was selected to be the capital of the newly formed Riau province in 1959.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sejarah Pekanbaru |url=https://pekanbaru.go.id/p/hal/sejarah-pekanbaru |website=pekanbaru.go.id |access-date=30 October 2020 |language=id}}</ref>

==Politics==
Since 1946, Pekanbaru has been governed by at least 15 mayors. The first mayor to rule this city was Datuk Wan Abdul Rahman who was elected on 17 May 1946. Currently, the Mayor of Pekanbaru is Zulham Hakim

==Demographics==

===Ethnicities===
Pekanbaru is the third most populous city on Sumatra Island after [[Medan]] and [[Palembang]], with a population of 983,356 according to the official Census for 2020;<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 1,123,348.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Pekanbaru Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.1471)</ref> The city is highly urbanised, drawing many of its people from the neighbouring province of [[West Sumatra]]. Since many centuries ago, Pekanbaru is one of the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] migration area. After [[World War II]], the number of Minangkabau people migrating to Pekanbaru surged, nearly doubling between the years 1943 and 1961. Many Minangkabau in Pekanbaru have lived there for generations and has since assimilated into the Malay community.<ref>Andaya, B.W; The Unity of Southeast Asia: Historical approaches and questions, in Journal of Southeast Asian Studies, Vol. 28, No. 1, 1997.</ref> In addition to the Minangkabau, the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Riau Malays]] are the second largest ethnic group in Pekanbaru, making up 30% of the population. The [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Batak (Indonesia)|Batak]], and [[Chinese Indonesian|Tionghoa]] are the other main ethnic groups inhabiting Pekanbaru.

===Religions===
The pluralism surrounding the city can be reflected by the variety of religions and freedom of belief among the people in Pekanbaru. Islam is the majority religion in this city, followed by Christianity (Protestantism and Catholic) as well as Buddhism and small percentage of Hinduism and Confucianism. Each religion in this city is represented by the presence of the religion's respective worship places, such as [[An-Nur Great Mosque]] and Pekanbaru Central Mosque (''Masjid Raya Pekanbaru'') for the Muslim community, St. Maria A Fatima Church and St. Paulus Church for the Catholic community, Huria Kristen Batak Protestan Church for the Protestant community as well as Vihara Dhamma Metta Arama, Vihara Dharma Loka and Vihara Vimala Virya for the Buddhist community and Kwan Tee Kong Bio (Vihara Satya Dharma) and Vihara Sasana Loka for Confucianist community and Pura Agung Jagatnatha for the Hindu community in Pekanbaru.

===Languages===
[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] is the official language that is spoken by the citizens of Pekanbaru. For informal use, Pekanbaru people generally use [[Minangkabau language]] in their economic and daily activities, especially in the market area. In addition the [[Malay language]]s and [[Javanese language|Javanese]] are also widely spoken because of the large population of Malays and Javanese people in Pekanbaru. [[Hokkien]] is mainly spoken by [[Chinese Indonesian|Tionghoa]] as most of the Chinese Indonesian in Pekanbaru belong to the [[Hoklo|Hokkien people]]. In fact, many Chinese Indonesian in Pekanbaru come from other regions in Riau such as [[Selat Panjang]], [[Bengkalis]] and [[Siak Regency|Siak]], along with the Chinese Indonesian who are originally from Pekanbaru itself. Moreover, many Chinese Indonesian especially from [[North Sumatra]], particularly the Medan and [[West Sumatra]] regions have moved to Pekanbaru due to opportunities and rapid economical growth in the area since the 1990s and 2000s.

==Economy==
After oil was discovered in the region in the 1930s, Pekanbaru's economy has depended heavily on oil revenues which caused the city to have the highest per capita income in Indonesia.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Most of Indonesia's [[petroleum]] is produced in Riau, and much of Pekanbaru's economy is based on the [[petroleum industry]]. International oil companies, prominently [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] from the US, as well as other Indonesian companies, have established their offices in the region. The city is connected by road to an oil refining and exporting port in [[Dumai]]. Many facilities and infrastructures such as an airport, stadiums, housing areas, schools, bridges that cross the Siak River in Pekanbaru, the roads in Rumbai and the roads to [[Dumai]], were partially or fully financed by oil companies in the area.

Pekanbaru is really close with some of the home of mega-companies, such as PT Riau Andalan Pulp Paper, PT. Indah Kiat, PT. Chevron Pacific Indonesia, and PT Perkebunan Nusantara V and some wood-sawmill, CPOs, and rubber-processing companies, and Pekanbaru is often said to be one of the cities with the highest money and banking rotation in Indonesia.

As Pekanbaru is prominently known as a major gateway for tourists from Singapore and Malaysia, the city has become a favourite stop-over for travellers before they go further inland to other regions of Sumatra Island such as Padang and Jambi. The Pasar Pusat (Central Market) is a food-trip destination and considered a household-goods trove. Pasar Bawah and Pasar Tengah, located near to the port and Siak riverbank, are especially known for the marketplace for buying and selling of Chinese goods like ceramics and carpets.

Around 127,000 foreign tourists arrived in Pekanbaru through its airport during 2018.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kunjungan Wisatawan Asing ke Riau Naik 30 Persen |url=https://nasional.republika.co.id/berita/nasional/daerah/19/01/20/plm7iz366-kunjungan-wisatawan-asing-ke-riau-naik-30-persen |access-date=30 October 2020 |work=Republika |date=20 January 2019 |language=id}}</ref>

On the other hand, there are many developments of shopping malls. Additionally, there are a lot of housing areas have been developed since the 2000s surrounding the city, particularly in ''Panam'' area whereby the housing project along the road has been tremendously established and now becoming one of the most populous area in Pekanbaru even though it is located far from downtown.

Favorably, there are several landmarks that have been built in this city. For example, The Great Mosque of An-nur, Mesjid Raya Pekanbaru, Pasar Bawah or ''Tourist Market'', Riau Bank Tower, Riau Government Office Tower, Siak IV Bridge, Zapin Dance Monument and there are many more to come.

==Transportation==

There are several modes of transportation in Pekanbaru such as taxi, bus, oplet (share taxi), bajaj (auto rickshaw), ojek (motorcycle taxi) and Trans Metro Pekanbaru ([[bus rapid transit]]). However, due to the rapidly increasing number of motorised vehicles, the traffic congestion that occurs on some roads such as ''Jalan Sudirman'', ''Jalan Riau'' and ''Jalan HR. Subrantas'' that mainly connect populous sub-districts in the city cannot be avoided any more particularly during weekends and holidays. These problems initiated the government of Pekanbaru to come up with plans to solve these matters, especially within 10 to 15 years ahead.

===Land===

For land transport, Pekanbaru is connected to [[Padang]], [[Medan]], [[Jambi]], [[Palembang]], and other cities or regions in Riau Province and Sumatra Island by the existence of Bandar Raya Payung Sekaki Bus Terminal. The terminal was officially open for public in 2007, replacing Pekanbaru's former "Mayang Terurai Terminal Bus" due to heavy congestion. However, the Bandar Raya Payung Sekaki Bus Terminal is not fully utilised by several prominent bus companies such as ''Pelangi'', ''Makmur'', ''Riau Mandiri'' and ''Sidomulyo'' as well as other bus operators because its location which is deemed by some parties to be not as strategic as Mayang Terurai Bus Terminal. These matters surely make some bus companies have no choice but to drop off the passengers outside the designated zone. This informal drop-off zone is usually called by local people as ''terminal bayangan'' ("shadow terminals").

===Rivers===
Port of Sungai Duku is located by the Siak River, connecting Pekanbaru with some regions in Riau Province and Riau Islands such as Siak, Tanjung Buton, Selat Panjang, Bengkalis and Batam. In the past, there were ferry services travelling from this port directly to [[Malacca]] in Malaysia, but the service was discontinued as several ferry companies decided to move their operations to Tanjung Buton.

===Air===
[[File:Sultan Syarif Kasim II International Airport Riau.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Sultan Syarif Kasim II International Airport]] of Pekanbaru]]

[[Sultan Syarif Kasim II International Airport]] serves flights in Pekanbaru from/and to several cities in [[Indonesia]] such as [[Batam]], [[Medan]], [[Bandung]], [[Jakarta]], [[Yogyakarta]], [[Surabaya]], and others, and international flights to several countries such as [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Sri Lanka]].  Several prominent domestic airlines serve the route from/and to Pekanbaru such as [[Citilink]], [[Garuda Indonesia]], [[Lion Air]], [[Batik Air]], [[Indonesia Air Asia]], [[Susi Air]], [[Super Air Jet]] and [[Wings Air]]. International flights are presently provided by [[AirAsia]], [[Jetstar Asia Airways]], [[Malindo Air]], [[Scoot]] and [[Batik Air Malaysia]]

In 2012, the new terminal was opened, replacing the old terminal that had been used since the 1980s. The old terminal is planned to be demolished to build more spaces for the apron and more aircraft capacity. Even though the new terminal has been fully used, the aerobridges that were constructed have never been utilized as the apron expansion has not been completed yet after two years since the opening of the new terminal to the public in 2012. Thus, the airport company ''PT Angkasa Pura II'' is currently ferrying passengers to and from the terminal using shuttle buses until the aerobridge can be used.
Pekanbaru's airport is also utilized separately as the airbase of the TNI-AU (Indonesian Air Force) and home base of the 12th Squadron, a shelter to some Hawk Mk.109s and Mk.209s. The airbase is named after the former head of Indonesian Air Force, ''Roesmin Nurjadin'' and formally called as ''Pangkalan Udara Roesmin Nurjadin'' or ''Roesmin Nurjadin Airbase''.

==Education==
Pekanbaru has a formal and informal form of education. Pekanbaru currently implements a "zonation" system to assign new students in public schools.

In 2012, [[2013 AFC U-22 Asian Cup qualification]], [[2012 Pekan Olahraga Nasional]] (Indonesian National Games) and [[2012 Pekan Paralympic Nasional]] was held in Riau Province. Since then, many sport facilities have been built in Pekanbaru because this city was the home for many sports venues used these multi-national events, such as the prominent [[Riau Main Stadium]]. Unfortunately, many sports facilities that have been developed before the [[2012 Pekan Olahraga Nasional]] are not being managed and taken care of properly. An example would be the Riau Main Stadium, which was never used again after the event until today due to financial disputes between the local government and the contractors of the stadium.

Several golf courses can be found in Pekanbaru, such as Pekanbaru Golf Course Country Club at Kubang Kulim, Simpang Tiga Golf Course at AURI Complex, Rumbai Golf Course at IKSORA Rumbai Complex and Labersa Golf Course at Labersa Hotel and Convention Center.
