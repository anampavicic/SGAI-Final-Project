Västerås is the seat of Västerås Municipality, which is the capital of [[Västmanland County]] and an [[episcopal see]].

== History==
[[File:Suecia 2-036 ; Västerås.jpg|left|thumb|Västerås {{Circa|1700}}, in ''[[Suecia antiqua et hodierna]]''.]]
[[File:Gustav Vasa triumphs 3.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gustav I of Sweden]] in Västerås, 1527. [[Watercolor painting|Watercolor]] reproduction from 1722.]]
Västerås is one of the oldest cities in Sweden and Northern Europe. The name originates from ''Västra Aros'' (West Aros), which refers to the river mouth of [[Svartån]]. The area has been populated since the Nordic [[Viking Age]], before 1000 CE. In the beginning of the 11th century it was the second largest city in Sweden, and by the 12th century had become the seat of the bishop.
[[Anundshög]] is located just outside the City of Västerås. Anundshög is Sweden's largest burial mound. "Hög" is derived from the [[Old Norse]] word ''haugr'' meaning mound or barrow.  It was built about 500 CE and is over {{convert|74|yd|m|abbr=in|order=flip}} wide and is almost {{cvt|10|yd|m|0|order=flip}} high.

In the ensuing centuries, a [[Västerås_Cathedral|cathedral]] and a monastery were built; the Gothic cathedral, rebuilt by [[Birger Jarl]] on an earlier site, and consecrated in 1271, was restored in the 19th century.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Vesterås|volume=27|page=1056}}</ref>  The first City Arms date from the end of the 13th century. A castle commands the town from an eminence; it was captured by King [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav I]] and rebuilt by him, and [[Eric XIV of Sweden|Eric XIV]] was confined there from 1573 to 1575.<ref name="EB1911"/> Gustav also called together the [[Parliament of Sweden|riksdag]] in Västerås. During the riksdag assembly, the decision was made to convert Sweden into a Protestant state and to remove the power of the Catholic Church.
''[[Rudbeckianska gymnasiet]]'', the oldest [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] ([[secondary school]]) in Sweden, was built in Västerås by [[Johannes Rudbeckius]] in 1623.
In the 18th and 19th centuries, the growing of [[cucumber]] became popular, and Västerås received the nickname ''Gurkstaden'' (the Cucumber City), which it still retains today.

== Today ==
[[File:Östermälarstand Västerås.jpg|thumb|left|[[Öster mälarstrand]] residential area in Västerås harbour.]]
Västerås is predominantly known as an industrial city, but also a retailing and logistics city. The city wants to distinguish itself as ''Västerås – Mälarstaden'', meaning "Västerås—the city by Lake [[Mälaren]]", in order to attract tourists and new inhabitants, as well as students to the local [[University]], [[Mälardalen University]] (approximately 16,000 enrolled students in Västerås and in the nearby [[Eskilstuna]]). To this effect, the city has started using a designed logo as branding in some official contexts, partially replacing the [[coat of arms]], as well as rebuilding several old harbor areas to make them more attractive to live in. Västerås has the largest lakeside commercial and recreational port in Scandinavia on Lake Mälaren. The lake has many islands, and there are tourist boats that go out to them daily in the summer.
The city also has a [[skyscraper]] colloquially nicknamed "[[Skrapan, Västerås|Skrapan]]" ({{langx|en|The Scraper}}) which has Sweden's highest-located [[cocktail bar]], called Sky Bar, on the 24th floor of the building. Until 2017, Västerås hosted [[Power Big Meet]], an annual event for owners and enthusiasts of classic American cars. The event moved to Lidköping in 2017, with arrangers citing having outgrown the available facilities in Västerås.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jonsson|first=Juila|url=https://www.vlt.se/artikel/bekraftat-power-big-meet-flyttar-fran-vasteras-johannisberg-ar-for-litet|title=Bekräftat: Power Big Meet flyttar från Västerås - "Johannisberg är för litet"|trans-title=Confirmed: Power Big Meet moves from Västerås – "Johannisberg is too small"|newspaper=[[Vestmanlands Läns Tidning]]|language=sv|date=30 October 2015|access-date=19 June 2019|archive-date=1 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190901163230/https://www.vlt.se/artikel/bekraftat-power-big-meet-flyttar-fran-vasteras-johannisberg-ar-for-litet|url-status=live}}</ref> Long-time Power Big Meet collaborator Klas Brink instead arranged the competing Västerås Summer Meet at the same location as Power Big Meet had been arranged for years.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brischetto|first1=Lucas|last2=Nygren|first2=Frida|url=https://www.vlt.se/artikel/klart-sa-ska-nya-power-meet-heta|title=Klart: Så ska "nya Power meet" heta|trans-title=Done: that's how the "new Power meet" should be called|newspaper=[[Vestmanlands Läns Tidning]]|language=sv|date=2 November 2016|access-date=19 June 2019|archive-date=1 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190901162948/https://www.vlt.se/artikel/klart-sa-ska-nya-power-meet-heta|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Climate==
According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], Västerås experiences a [[humid continental climate]] bordering, according to the original {{convert|-3|C|F}} isotherm, an [[oceanic climate]] (''Dfb''/''Cfb'') with cold winters and warm summers.
Summers tend to be quite unpredictable with sunny spells but with a risk of sudden showers. The sunniest weather usually occurs when high-pressure systems are blocking the low-pressure systems that usually move in from the Atlantic Ocean. Daytime temperatures in July mostly hover around {{cvt|22|C|F|0}}, but may sometimes exceed {{cvt|25|C|F|0}} and occasionally even {{cvt|30|C|F}}.
Winters are usually cold with a snow cover that lasts for several months. Some winters can be mild with longer spells without snow on the ground. The weather differs a lot whether the air masses are coming from the Atlantic Ocean or from the Eurasian continent. In the first case, temperatures over {{cvt|5|C|F}} might be expected. In the second case, the temperature may not rise above {{cvt|-15|C|F}} in the middle of the day. [[Mälaren|Lake Mälaren]] is usually frozen from December until the end of March.
[[File:3000' ovanför Västerås.jpg|thumb|Aerial photo of a wintry Västerås.]]
The highest official temperature reading of {{cvt|36.0|C|F|1}} was recorded on 9 July 1966. The lowest temperature of {{cvt|-36.5|C|F|1}} was recorded on 24 January 1875.<ref name=SMHI>{{cite web |title= Västmanlands klimat |trans-title= Climate of Västmanland |url= http://www.smhi.se/kunskapsbanken/meteorologi/vastmanlands-klimat-1.4931 |publisher= SMHI |access-date= 28 June 2013 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121115092635/http://www.smhi.se/kunskapsbanken/meteorologi/vastmanlands-klimat-1.4931 |archive-date= 15 November 2012 }}</ref>

[[File:Turbinhuset September 2014 04.jpg|thumb|The Turbine House]]
In 1891, the [[Turbine House]], a small [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] dam was built on [[Svartån]], in central Västerås.  This early electrification encouraged [[ASEA]], a large electricity equipment manufacturer, to concentrate its operations in Västerås, shifting focus away from [[Arboga]]. After the 1988 merger with the power systems company [[Brown, Boveri & Cie]], [[ASEA]] became [[ABB Group]]. As a result, Västerås is home to its ABB [[Aktiebolag|AB]] Swedish subsidiary headquarters. ABB in Västerås maintains production, e.g. robots and drive systems for  industry, high-voltage direct current transmission and power grids.
[[File:Asea hq.jpg|thumb|ASEA headquarters]]
A number of business units have been spun out of ABB. Principal among them is Hitachi Energy ([[Hitachi]]).
Since the Westinghouse takeover of ABB's nuclear business it is owned by [[Westinghouse Electric Company]]. It is situated mainly in Finnslätten, an industrial area in the northern part of Västerås. Westinghouse Sweden produces nuclear fuel and offers nuclear services for [[Boiling Water Reactor]]s and [[Pressurized water reactor]]s. {{As of|2014}}, Westinghouse Sweden had more than 1000 employees.<ref>{{cite web|title=Westinghouse Electric Sweden|url=http://www.westinghousenuclear.com/ProductLines/Nuclear_Fuel/sweden.shtm|work=Company website|publisher=Westinghouse|access-date=15 April 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416181553/http://www.westinghousenuclear.com/ProductLines/Nuclear_Fuel/sweden.shtm|archive-date=16 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The plant has provided fuel for Ukraine since 2005.

[[Mälarenergi]] AB is a city-owned district heating and electric power provider for Västerås and surrounding area. Mälarenergi owns and operates a number of plants of which the biggest one is the heat and power plant in Västerås. It is Sweden's largest combined heat and power plant, and the latest unit (number 6) uses waste as fuel.
Other major industries include [[Bombardier Transportation]], which is active in railway business with production of propulsion systems for trains with worldwide customers, [[GE Power]] Sweden, [[Enics]], Quintus Technologies AB (high pressure metal working and material densification equipment for the manufacturing industry) and [[Northvolt|Northvolt AB]] which designs, develops and manufactures lithium-ion battery cells and complete battery systems for electric vehicles, heavy transport, mining, and energy industries, as well as portable devices.

=== Retailing and trade ===
One of the historical reasons that made Västerås a city is its trading-friendly location by the river Svartån and lake Mälaren. The city remains one of the main logistical centers in Sweden due to its central location in the densely populated region [[Mälaren Valley|Mälardalen]] and favourable infrastructure connections with railways, waterways and highways. Amongst others, [[ICA AB]] has one of its main distribution centres located in Västerås.
Västerås is the birthplace of multinational clothing retailer [[H&M]]. Their first store was opened in the town centre in 1947.<ref name=h&m>{{cite web|url=http://about.hm.com/AboutSection/en/About/Facts-About-HM/People-and-History/Our-History.html|title=H&M: Our-History|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319073126/http://about.hm.com/AboutSection/en/About/Facts-About-HM/People-and-History/Our-History.html|archive-date=2013-03-19}}</ref>
[[Erikslund Shopping Center]], on the outskirts of Västerås, was Sweden's biggest mall until [[Mall of Scandinavia]] opened in 2015, and the [[Power center (retail)|retail park]] is the third biggest in sales after [[Kungens Kurva]] and [[Barkarby]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ikano och Ikea: 136 000 kvm handel vid Globen|trans-title=Ikano and Ikea: 136,000 m<sup>2</sup> of retail at the Globe|url=http://www.fastighetsvarlden.se/notiser/ikano-och-ikea-136-000-kvm-handel-vid-globen/|publisher=Fastighetsvärlden|access-date=16 January 2015|language=sv|date=2013-01-23|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223103727/http://www.fastighetsvarlden.se/notiser/ikano-och-ikea-136-000-kvm-handel-vid-globen/|archive-date=23 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Östin|first=Magnus|title=Erikslund behåller sin tredje plats|trans-title=Erikslund retains its third place|url=http://vlt.se/nyheter/vasteras/1.2752469-erikslund-behaller-sin-tredje-plats|newspaper=[[Vestmanlands Läns Tidning]]|access-date=16 January 2015|language=sv|date=7 December 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402145647/http://vlt.se/nyheter/vasteras/1.2752469-erikslund-behaller-sin-tredje-plats|archive-date=2 April 2015}}</ref>
