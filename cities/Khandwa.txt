===Ancient history===
Recent explorations in the beds/tributaries of [[Narmada River|Narmada]] have revealed traces of the Paleolithic men in East Nimar district. Omkar Mandhata, a rocky island on the bank of Narmada river, about 47 miles north-west of Khandwa, is said to have been conquered by the Haihaya king Mahishmant, who had named the same as [[Mahishmati]].<ref name="Encyclopaedia">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8897ridkczoC&q=Mahishmati&pg=PA435 | title=Encyclopaedia of Ancient Indian Geography, Volume 2 | publisher=Genesis Publishing Pvt Ltd | author=Subodh Kapoor | year=2002 | page=435 | isbn=9788177552997}}</ref>

During the rise of [[Buddhism]], the East Nimar region was included in Avanti Kingdom under Chand Pradyota Mahesana, which was later added to the growing empire of [[Magadha (Mahajanapada)|Magadha]] by Shishunaga. From the early 2nd century BCE to late 15th century CE, the Nimar Region (earlier a part of Khandesh) was ruled by many dynasties, which include Mauryas, Shungas, Early Satvahanas, Kardamakas, and Abhiras ([[Ahir]] Gavli).<ref name="gondhitory">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gu_cN0MhteMC&q=ahir+gond&pg=PA569 | title=Gonds of the Central Indian Highlands Vol II | publisher=Concept Publishing Company | author=B.H.
