'''Varna''' ({{langx|bg|Варна}}, {{IPA|bg|ˈvarnɐ|pron}}) is the [[List of cities and towns in Bulgaria|third-largest city]] in [[Bulgaria]] and the largest city and [[seaside resort]] on the [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast]] and in the [[Northern Bulgaria]] region. Situated strategically in the [[Gulf of Varna]], the city has been a major economic, social and cultural centre for almost three millennia. Historically known as ''Odessos'' ({{langx|grc|Ὀδησσός}}), Varna developed from a [[Thracian]] seaside settlement into a major [[seaport]] on the [[Black Sea]].

Varna is an important centre for business, transportation, education, tourism, entertainment, and healthcare. The city is referred to as the maritime capital of Bulgaria and has the headquarters of the [[Bulgarian Navy]] and merchant marine. In 2008, Varna was designated as the seat of the [[Black Sea Euroregion]] by the [[Council of Europe]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bg-news.org/news101235_5 |title=Варна (Varna) Becomes Centre of the Black Sea Euro-Region (Bulgarian) |publisher=Bg-news.org |access-date=8 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730015529/http://www.bg-news.org/news101235_5 |archive-date=30 July 2014 }}</ref> In 2014, Varna was awarded the title of [[European Youth Capital]] 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanyouthcapital.org/yfj/varna-bulgaria-awarded-european-youth-capital-2017/|title=Varna awarded European Youth Capital|publisher=European Youth Capital|access-date=25 February 2017|archive-date=1 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901114300/http://www.europeanyouthcapital.org/yfj/varna-bulgaria-awarded-european-youth-capital-2017/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
[[File:Night shot of Varna.jpg|thumb|Varna at night]]
[[File:Lighthouse Varna,Bulgaria.jpg|thumb|Lighthouse in Varna]]

[[Theophanes the Confessor]] first mentions the name ''Varna'', as the city came to be known, within the context of the [[Slavs|Slavic]] conquest of the [[Balkans]] in the 6th to 7th centuries. The name could be of [[Varangian]] origin, as Varangians had been crossing the Black Sea for many years, reaching [[Constantinople]] in the early Middle Ages. In [[Swedish language|Swedish]], ''värn'' means 'shield, defense'&nbsp;– hence Varna could mean 'defended, fortified place'. Vikings invaded the settlement during the Middle Ages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bnews.bg/article-78482|title=Monument of the Vikings to be built near Varna|publisher=bnews.bg|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120122750/http://www.bnews.bg/article-78482|archive-date=20 January 2015|access-date=20 January 2015}}</ref> The name may be older than that; perhaps it derives from the [[Proto-Indo-European root]] ''*u̯er-'' 'to flow, wet, water, river'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE575.html |title=w-r- ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition''. 2000 |publisher=Bartleby.com |access-date=6 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124172602/http://bartleby.com/61/roots/IE575.html |archive-date=24 January 2009 }}</ref><ref>Gerhard Köbler: ''Indogermanisches Wörterbuch''.

[[Varuna]]), or from the [[Proto-Slavic]] root ''varn'' 'black', or from [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] ''bar'' or ''var'' 'camp, fortress' (see also [[Etymological list of provinces of Bulgaria]]).

According to Theophanes, in 680 [[Asparuh of Bulgaria|Asparukh]], the founder of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]], routed an army of [[Constantine IV]] near the Danube River delta. Pursuing those forces, he reached "the so-called Varna near Odyssos {{sic}} and the midlands thereof" (τὴν λεγομένην Βάρναν, πλησίον Ὀδυσσοῦ). Perhaps the new name applied initially to an adjacent river or lake, a Roman military camp, or an inland area, and only later to the city itself.

By the late 10th century, the name ''Varna'' was established so firmly that when Byzantines wrested back control of the area from the Bulgarians around 975, they kept it rather than restoring the ancient name ''Odessos''.

== History ==
{{see also|Timeline of Varna}}

=== Prehistory ===
{{See also|Varna Necropolis}}
Prehistoric settlements are best known for the [[Chalcolithic]] [[Varna Necropolis|necropolis]] (mid-5th millennium BC radiocarbon dating), a key archaeological site in world prehistory, eponymous [[Varna culture]] and internationally considered the world's oldest large find of gold artefacts, existed within modern city limits. In the wider region of the Varna lakes (before the 1900s, freshwater) and the adjacent [[karst]] springs and caves, over 30 prehistoric settlements have been unearthed with the earliest artefacts dating back to the [[Middle Paleolithic]] or 100,000 years ago.

=== Thracians ===
Since late [[Bronze Age]] (13th–12th c. BC) the area around Odessos had been populated with [[Thracians]]. During 8th–9th c. BC local [[Thracians]] had active commercial and cultural contacts with people from [[Anatolia]], [[Thessaly]], [[Caucasus]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. These links were reflected in some local productions, for example, forms of bronze [[Fibula (brooch)|fibula]] of the age, either imported or locally made. There is no doubt that interactions occurred mostly by sea and the bay of Odessos is one of the places where the exchanges took place. Some scholars consider that during the 1st millennium BC, the region was also settled by the half-mythical [[Cimmerians]]. An example of their, probably accidental, presence, is the [[tumulus]] dated 8th–7th c. BC found near [[Belogradets]], Varna Province.

The region around Odessos was densely populated with Thracians long before the coming of the Greeks on the west seashore of the Black Sea. [[Pseudo-Scymnus]] writes: "...Around the city [Odessos] lives the Thracian tribe named Crobises." This is also evidenced by various ceramic pottery, made by hand or by a [[Potter's wheel]], bronze ornaments for horse-fittings and iron weapons, all found in Thracian necropolises dated 6th–4th c. BC near the villages of Dobrina, Kipra, Brestak and other, all in [[Varna Province]]. The Thracians in the region were ruled by kings, who entered into unions with the [[Odrysian kingdom]], [[Getae]] or [[Sapaeans]]—large Thracian states existing between 5th–1st c. BC. Between 336–280 BC these Thracian states along with Odessos were conquered by [[Alexander the Great]].

Archaeological findings have indicated that the population of northeast Thrace was very diverse, including the region around Odessos. During 6th–4th c. BC the region was populated with [[Scythians]] who normally inhabited the central [[Eurasian Steppe]] (South Russia and Ukraine) and partly the area south of river Istros (the Thracian name of lower [[Danube]]). Characteristic for their culture weapons and bronze objects are found all over the region. Scythian horse ornaments are produced in "animal style", which is very close to the Thracian style, a possible explanation for the frequent mixture of both folks in northeastern Thrace. Many bronze artefacts give testimony for such process, for example, applications and front plates for horseheads, as well as moulds for such products in nearby and more distanced settlements. Since the 4th c. BC the region had been populated by more [[Getae]], which is a Thracian tribe populating both shores around the [[Danube Delta]].

[[Celts]] started populating the region after their invasion of the [[Balkan peninsula]] in 280 BC. All over northeast Bulgaria and even near Odessos were found a significant number of bronze items with Celtic ornaments and typical weapons, all quickly adopted by Thracians. Arkovna, 80&nbsp;km near Odessos, was probably the permanent capital of Celts' last king Kavar (270/260–216/210 BC). Probably after the downfall of his kingdom, Celts blended with the greatly numbered Thracians in the country.
Between the 2nd–1st c. BC in present [[Dobruja|Dobrudja]] land between Dyonissopolis ([[Balchik]]) and Odessos were created many small Scythian states. Their "kings" minted their coins in [[Mint (facility)|mints]] located in cities on the west Black Sea coast, including Odessos.

The Thracians in northeast Thrace seem to be underdeveloped compared to their counterparts in South Thrace. The people lived in two types of settlements: non-fortified, located in fertile lands near water sources and stone-built fortresses in hard to reach mountain environment, where were usually located the kings' residences. Thracians engaged in farming, wood processing, hunting and fishing. Among their art crafts is metal processing—especially weapons, excelling processing of bronze, making of bracelets, rings, Thracian type of fibulas, horse ornaments, arrowheads. Local goldsmiths used gold and silver to produce typical Thracian plate armour, ceremonial ornaments for the horses of the kings and the aristocracy, as well as valuable [[patera]]s and [[Rhyton|ritons]].

Despite ethnic diversity, numerous internal and external conflicts, and cultural differences, the populations of northeastern Bulgaria and the cities along the seashore have demonstrated stable tolerance to each other. Conservatism is easily noticed in ceramic items and in religion. The highest deity of all was the [[Thracian horseman]], who had different names and functions in different places. Water-related deities were honoured as well, such as [[Charites|The Three Graces]] or the water [[Nymph]]s and [[Zalmoxis]] by the [[Getae]].
During the centuries, especially by the end of the [[Hellenistic period]] (2nd–1st c. BC), Thracians adopted the more elaborated Hellenistic culture, thus acting as an intermediate for the continental Thracians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeo.museumvarna.com/en/category/list?category_id=6&id=7|title=Odessos, Thracians|publisher=Archaeological Museum Varna|access-date=23 February 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223213142/http://www.archaeo.museumvarna.com/en/category/list?category_id=6&id=7|archive-date=23 February 2017}}</ref>

The Greek alphabet has been used for inscriptions in [[Thracian language|Thracian]] since at least the 5th century BC.

Odessos was included in the assessment of the [[Delian league]] of 425 BC. In 339 BC, it was unsuccessfully besieged by [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] (priests of the Getae persuaded him to conclude a treaty) but surrendered to [[Alexander the Great]] in 335 BC, and was later ruled by his [[Diadochi|diadochus]] [[Lysimachus]], against whom it rebelled in 313 BC as part of a coalition with other Pontic cities and the Getae. Nevertheless, at the end of the 4th c. BC the city became one of the strongholds of Lysimachus. The city became very prosperous from this time due to strong sea trade with many of the Mediterranean states and cities supported by a wide range of local products. Shortly after 108 BC, Odessos recognised the suzerainty of [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]].

The Roman city, ''Odessus'', first included into the ''Praefectura orae maritimae'' and then in 15 AD annexed to the province of [[Moesia]] (later ''Moesia Inferior''), covered 47 hectares in present-day central Varna and had prominent public baths, [[Roman Thermae (Varna)|Thermae]], erected in the late 2nd century AD (so-called Large (North) Ancient Roman Thermae), now the largest Roman remains in Bulgaria (the building was {{convert|100|m|2|abbr=on}} wide, {{convert|70|m|2|abbr=on}} long, and {{convert|25|m|2|abbr=on}} high) and fourth-largest-known Roman baths in Europe which testify to the importance of the city.

Thirdly in the 6th century, an extra pipeline was added parallel to the original west of it and entered the city through a reconstruction of the fortress wall. The city minted coins, both as an autonomous [[polis]] and under the [[Roman Empire]] from [[Trajan]] to [[Cornelia Salonina|Salonina]], the wife of [[Gallienus]], some of which survive.<ref name=DGRG/>

In 6th-century imperial documents, it was referred to as "holiest city," ''sacratissima civitas''. In 442 a peace treaty between [[Theodosius II]] and [[Attila]] was conducted at Odessos. In 513, it became a focal point of the [[Vitalian (general)|Vitalian]] revolt. In 536, [[Justinian I]] made it the seat of the [[Quaestura exercitus]] ruled by a ''prefect of Scythia'' or ''quaestor Justinianus'' and including Lower Moesia, [[Scythia]], Caria, the [[Aegean Islands]] and Cyprus; later, the military camp outside Odessos was the seat of another senior Roman commander, ''magister militum per Thracias''.

=== Bulgarian conquest ===
It has been suggested that the 681 AD peace treaty with the [[Byzantine Empire]] that established the new Bulgarian state was concluded at Varna and the first Bulgarian capital south of the Danube may have been provisionally located in its vicinity—possibly in an ancient city near Lake Varna's north shore named Theodorias (Θεοδωριάς) by Justinian I—before it moved to [[Pliska]] {{convert|70|km|0|abbr=off}} to the west.<ref>{{cite web |author=Standartnews Ltd. |url=http://paper.standartnews.com/archive/2006/01/28/supplement/s4689_9.htm |title=Дървен град предхожда каменната Плиска |language=bg |publisher=Paper.standartnews.com |access-date=8 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213102029/http://paper.standartnews.com/archive/2006/01/28/supplement/s4689_9.htm |archive-date=13 February 2012  }}</ref> [[Asparuh of Bulgaria|Asparukh]] fortified the Varna river lowland by a [[Rampart (fortification)|rampart]] against a possible Byzantine landing; the ''Asparuhov val'' (Asparukh's Wall) is still standing. Numerous 7th-century [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] settlements have been excavated across the city and further west; the Varna lakes north shores, of all regions, were arguably most densely populated by Bulgars. It has been suggested that Asparukh was aware of the importance of the Roman military camp (''campus tribunalis'') established by Justinian I outside Odessos and considered it (or its remnants) as the legitimate seat of power for both Lower Moesia and Scythia.

=== Middle Ages ===
Control changed from Byzantine to Bulgarian hands several times during the [[Middle Ages]]. In the late 9th and the first half of the 10th century, Varna was the site of a principal [[scriptorium]] of the [[Preslav Literary School]] at a monastery endowed by [[Boris I]] who may have also used it as his monastic retreat. The scriptorium may have played a key role in the development of [[Cyrillic script]] by Bulgarian scholars under the guidance of one of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]]' disciples. [[Karel Škorpil]] suggested that Boris I may have been interred there. The synthetic culture with Hellenistic Thracian, Roman, as well as eastern—Armenian, Syrian, Persian—traits that developed around Odessos in the 6th century under Justinian I, may have influenced the Pliska-Preslav culture of the First Bulgarian Empire, ostensibly in architecture and plastic decorative arts, but possibly also in literature, including Cyrillic scholarship. In 1201, [[Kaloyan]] took over the Varna fortress, then in Byzantine hands, on [[Holy Saturday]] using a [[siege tower]], and secured it for the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]].

[[File:Varna fortress.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|Plan of Varna's medieval fortress.]]

By the late 13th century, with the Treaty of Nymphaeum of 1261, the offensive-defensive alliance between [[Michael VIII Palaeologus]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] that opened up the Black Sea to Genoese commerce, Varna had turned into a thriving commercial port city frequented by Genoese and later also by [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] and [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] merchant ships. The first two maritime republics held consulates and had expatriate colonies there (Ragusan merchants remained active at the port through the 17th century operating from their colony in nearby [[Provadiya]]). The city was flanked by two fortresses with smaller commercial ports of their own, Kastritsi and Galata, within sight of each other, and was protected by two other strongholds overlooking the lakes, Maglizh and Petrich. Wheat, animal skins, honey and wax, wine, timber and other local agricultural produce for the Italian and Constantinople markets were the chief exports, and Mediterranean foods and luxury items were imported. The city introduced its own monetary standard, the ''Varna [[Hyperpyron|perper]]'', by the mid-14th century; Bulgarian and Venetian currency exchange rate was fixed by a treaty. Fine jewellery, household ceramics, fine leather and food processing, and other crafts flourished; shipbuilding developed in the [[Kamchiya]] river mouth.

Fourteenth-century Italian [[portolan chart]]s showed Varna as arguably the most important seaport between [[Constantinople]] and the Danube delta; they usually labelled the region [[Zagore (region)|Zagora]]. The city was unsuccessfully besieged by [[Amadeus VI]] of Savoy, who had captured all Bulgarian fortresses to the south of it, including Galata, in 1366. In 1386, Varna briefly became the capital of the spinoff [[Principality of Karvuna]], then was taken over by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1389 (and again in 1444), ceded temporarily to [[Manuel II Palaiologos|Manuel II Palaeologus]] in 1413 (perhaps until 1444), and sacked by [[Crimean Tatars|Tatars]] in 1414.

=== Battle of Varna ===
{{Main|Battle of Varna}}
[[File:VarnaMemorial.jpg|thumb|Memorial of the [[Battle of Varna]] of 1444 carved into an ancient [[Thracians|Thracian]] [[Tumulus|burial mound]]]]

On 10 November 1444, one of the last major battles of the [[Crusade]]s in European history was fought outside the city walls. [[Ottoman Army|Ottomans]] routed an army of 20,000–30,000 crusaders<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vn.government.bg/stranici/oblast/560/shanko3.doc|author=Apostolov, Shanko (Director, Władysław Warneńczyk Park Museum, Varna)|title=The Campaigns of Ladislaus of Varna and John Hunyadi in 1443–1444|language=bg|access-date=8 June 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220161213/http://www.vn.government.bg/stranici/oblast/560/shanko3.doc|archive-date=20 February 2012}}</ref> led by [[Ladislaus III of Poland]] (also Ulászló I of Hungary), which had assembled at the port to set sail to Constantinople. The Christian army was attacked by a superior force of 55,000 or 60,000 Ottomans led by [[sultan]] [[Murad II]]. Ladislaus III was killed in a bold attempt to capture the sultan, earning the sobriquet ''Warneńczyk'' (''of Varna'' in Polish; he is also known as ''Várnai Ulászló'' in Hungarian or ''Ladislaus Varnensis'' in Latin). The failure of the [[Crusade of Varna]] made the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 all but inevitable, and Varna (with all of Bulgaria) was to remain under Ottoman domination for over four centuries. Today, there is a [[cenotaph]] of Ladislaus III in Varna.

=== Late Ottoman rule ===
A major port, agricultural, trade and shipbuilding centre for the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 16th and 17th centuries, preserving a significant and economically active Bulgarian population, Varna was later made one of the ''Quadrilateral Fortresses'' (along with [[Rousse]], Shumen, and [[Silistra]]) severing [[Dobruja]] from the rest of Bulgaria and containing Russia in the [[History of the Russo-Turkish wars|Russo-Turkish war]]s. The Russians temporarily took over the city in 1773 and again in 1828, following the prolonged [[Siege of Varna]], returning it to the Ottomans two years later after the medieval fortress was razed.

In the early 19th century, many local Greeks joined the patriotic organisation [[Filiki Eteria]]. Αt the outbreak of the [[Greek War of Independence]] (1821) revolutionary activity was recorded in Varna. As a result, local notables that participated in the Greek national movement were executed by the Ottoman authorities, while others managed to escape to Greece and continue their struggle.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kotzabassi|first=Maria|title=Varna (Modern period)|url=http://blacksea.ehw.gr/Forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaID=11495|publisher=Εγκυκλοπαίδεια Μείζονος Ελληνισμού|access-date=9 October 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405033921/http://blacksea.ehw.gr/Forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaID=11495|archive-date=5 April 2012}}</ref>

The British and French campaigning against Russia in the [[Crimean War]] (1854–1856) used Varna as headquarters and principal naval base; many soldiers died of cholera and the city was devastated by a fire. A British and a French monument mark the cemeteries where cholera victims were interred. In 1866, the first railroad in Bulgaria connected Varna with the Rousse on the Danube, linking the Ottoman capital [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] with Central Europe; for a few years, the [[Orient Express]] ran through that route. The port of Varna developed as a major supplier of food—notably wheat from the adjacent breadbasket [[Southern Dobruja]]—to Constantinople and a busy hub for European imports to the capital; 12 foreign consulates opened in the city. Local Bulgarians took part in the [[Bulgarian National Revival|National Revival]]; [[Vasil Levski]] set up a secret revolutionary committee.

=== Third Bulgarian State ===
[[File:Karte der Stadt Warna 1897.jpg|thumb|City map of 1897]]
In 1878, the city, which had 26,000 inhabitants, was given to Bulgaria by Russian troops, who entered on 27 July. Varna became a front city in the [[First Balkan War]] and the [[First World War]]; its economy was badly affected by the temporary loss of its agrarian hinterland of Southern Dobruja to Romania (1913–16 and 1919–40). In the [[Second World War]], the [[Red Army]] occupied the city in September 1944 and helped to cement communist rule in Bulgaria.

One of the early centres of industrial development and the Bulgarian labour movement, Varna established itself as the nation's principal port of export, a major grain-producing and [[viticulture]] centre, seat of the nation's oldest institution of higher learning outside Sofia, a popular venue for international festivals and events, and the country's ''de facto'' summer capital with the erection of the [[Euxinograd]] royal summer palace (currently, the Bulgarian government convenes summer sessions there). Mass tourism emerged since the late 1950s. Heavy industry and trade with the Soviet Union boomed in the 1950s to the 1970s.

From 20 December 1949 to 20 October 1956 the city was renamed Stalin by the communist government after Soviet dictator [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref>{{cite web |author=BSH |url=http://varna.info.bg/english/name_of_varna_en.htm |title=The names of Varna |publisher=Varna.info.bg |date=21 December 1949 |access-date=6 May 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518183425/http://varna.info.bg/english/name_of_varna_en.htm |archive-date=18 May 2011 }}</ref>

In 1962, the 15th [[Chess Olympiad]], also known as the World Team Championship, organized by [[FIDE]], was held in Varna. In 1969 and 1987, Varna was the host of the World [[Rhythmic Gymnastics]] Championships. From 30 September to 4 October 1973, the 10th [[Olympic Congress]] took place in the [[Palace of Culture and Sports]].

Varna became a popular resort for Eastern Europeans, who were barred from travelling to the West until 1989. One of them, the veteran East German communist [[Otto Braun (communist)|Otto Braun]], died on a vacation in Varna in 1974.

== Geography ==
[[File:Varna bay2.jpg|thumb|[[Gulf of Varna|Varna bay]]]]

The city occupies {{convert|238|km2|4=0|abbr=on}}<ref>[http://www.varna.bg/varna/varna.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718235831/http://www.varna.bg/varna/varna.htm|date=18 July 2011}}</ref> on verdant terraces (Varna [[monocline]] of the [[Moesian Platform]]) descending from the calcareous Franga Plateau (height {{convert|356|m|4=0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) on the north and Avren Plateau on the south, along the horseshoe-shaped [[Gulf of Varna|Varna Bay]] of the [[Black Sea]], the elongated [[Lake Varna]], and two artificial waterways connecting the bay and the lake and bridged by the [[Asparuhov most]]. It is the centre of a growing conurbation stretching along the seaboard {{convert|20|km|4=0|abbr=on}} north and {{convert|10|km|4=0|abbr=on}} south (mostly residential and recreational sprawl) and along the lake {{convert|25|km|4=0|abbr=on}} west (mostly transportation and industrial facilities). Since antiquity, the city has been surrounded by vineyards, orchards, and forests. Commercial shipping facilities are being relocated inland into the lakes and canals, while the bay remains a recreation area; almost all the waterfront is parkland.

The urban area has in excess of 20&nbsp;km of sand beaches and abounds in thermal mineral water sources (temperature {{convert|35|-|55|C|disp=or}}). It enjoys a mild climate influenced by the sea with long, mild, akin to Mediterranean, autumns, and sunny and hot, yet considerably cooler than Mediterranean summers moderated by breezes and regular rainfall. Although Varna receives about two-thirds of the average rainfall for Bulgaria, abundant groundwater keeps its wooded hills lush throughout summer. The city is cut off from north and northeast winds by hills along the north arm of the bay, yet January and February still can be bitterly cold at times, with blizzards. Black Sea water has become cleaner after 1989 due to decreased chemical fertiliser in farming; it has low salinity, lacks large predators or poisonous species, and the tidal range is virtually imperceptible.

The city lies {{convert|470|km|4=0|abbr=on}} north-east of Sofia; the nearest major cities are [[Dobrich]] ({{convert|45|km|4=0|abbr=on|disp=or}} to the north), [[Shumen]] ({{convert|80|km|4=0|abbr=on|disp=or}} to the west), and [[Burgas]] ({{convert|125|km|4=0|abbr=on|disp=or}} to the south-west).

=== Climate ===
Varna has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa'').
The specific Black sea climate is milder than the inland parts of the country and the sea influence lowers the effect of the occasional cold air masses from the north-east. Average precipitation is the lowest for the country and sunshine is abundant.<ref>{{cite web |title=Черноморска област |url=http://geografia.kabinata.com/13.htm |access-date=17 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191219055305/http://geografia.kabinata.com/13.htm |archive-date=19 December 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The summer begins in early May and lasts till early October.

== Governance ==
Varna is the administrative centre for Varna county (област, ''oblast'', area). On the other hand, Varna municipality (община, ''obshtina'', borough) comprises the city and five suburbs: [[Kamenar, Varna Province|Kamenar]], [[Kazashko]], [[Konstantinovo, Varna Province|Konstantinovo]], [[Topoli, Varna Province|Topoli]], and [[Zvezditsa, Varna Province|Zvezditsa]], served by the city public transport system.

=== Local government ===
[[File:Maritime Administration in Varna, Bulgaria.jpg|thumb|Marine Administration Varna]]

The municipal chief executive is the Mayor (кмет, ''kmet'': the word is [[cognate]] with [[count]]). Since the end of the ''de facto'' one-party communist rule in 1990, there have been four mayors: Voyno Voynov, SDS ([[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]]), ''ad interim'', 1990–91; Hristo Kirchev, SDS, 1991–99; [[Kiril Yordanov]], independent, 1999–2013; [[Ivan Portnih]], [[GERB]], 2013–2023; [[Blagomir Kotsev]], [[PP–DB]], 2023–present.

The City council (общински съвет, ''obshtinski savet'', the 51-member legislature) is the city's legislative body composed of 51 members. As of January 2015 it consists of: centre-right [[Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria]] (GERB), 22 council members; centre-right/right-wing [[Reformist Bloc]] [[Patriotic Front (Bulgaria)]], 6; centre-left [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]] (BSP), 5; "Varna" Coalition including [[Attack (political party)|Attack]], 4; other smaller parties, groups and independent members, 14.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.varna.bg/bg/articles/2866/Регистър_на_групите.html|title=Varna City Council|publisher=varna.bg|access-date=28 February 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625103648/http://varna.bg/bg/articles/2866/%D0%A0%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8A%D1%80_%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%B3%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5.html|archive-date=25 June 2017}}</ref>

=== Boroughs and urban planning ===
The city is divided by law into five boroughs ({{langx|bg|райони|rayoni}}), each with its mayor and council: [[Asparuhovo, Varna|Asparuhovo]], Mladost, Odessos (the historic centre), Primorski (the largest one with official population of 102,000 also comprising the seaside resorts north of the city centre), and Vladislav Varchenchik. The boroughs are composed of various districts with distinctive characters and histories.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grao.bg/tna/tab02.txt |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 June 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620194059/http://www.grao.bg/tna/tab02.txt |archive-date=20 June 2012 }}</ref> The villages too have а mayor or a mayoral lieutenant (кметски наместник, ''kmetski namestnik'').

=== Policing and crime ===
{{Main|Crime in Bulgaria}}
[[File:MVR Varna.jpg|thumb|Police regional directorate]]

Varna was rumoured to be the hub of [[:Category:Organized crime in Bulgaria|Bulgarian organised crime]]. Some sectors of the economy, including gambling, corporate security, tourism, real estate, and professional sports, were believed to be controlled in part by business groups with links to Communist-era secret services or the military.

However, it is noted that in Varna, the so-called ''mutri'' (Mafia) presence was by no means as visible as it was in smaller coastal towns and resorts. Over the last couple of years, crime has subsided, which is said to have contributed to Varna being named as Bulgaria's Best City to Live In (2007);<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dariknews.bg/view_article.php?article_id=204974 |title=Варна е най-добрият град за живеене в България – DARIK News |date=6 December 2007 |publisher=Dariknews.bg |access-date=6 May 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113151115/http://dariknews.bg/view_article.php?article_id=204974 |archive-date=13 January 2008 }}</ref> in 2007, the regional police chief was promoted to the helm of the national police service.

Most Varnians (варненци, ''varnentsi'') are ethnic [[Bulgarians]] (94%). Ethnic Turks rank second with 3%; however by 2009, [[Russians]] and other Russian-speaking recent immigrants with no Bulgarian citizenship, estimated at over 20,000, perhaps have outnumbered them, additionally there is a growing number of new Asian and African immigrants and corporate [[expatriate]]s. These are mostly students of the medical university of Varna. There is a comparable number of Romani (1% of the population) mostly in three distinctive and largely impoverished neighbourhoods: Maksuda; Rozova Dolina in the [[Asparuhovo, Varna|Asparuhovo]] district; and Chengene Kula in the Vladislavovo district, while Varna is spearheading several programs on Romani integration. [[Armenians]], [[Greeks]], Jews, and other long-standing ethnic groups are also present although in much smaller numbers. With the departure of most Turks and Greeks and the arrival of Bulgarian refugees and settlers from inland, Northern [[Dobruja]], [[Bessarabia]], and [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], and later, of refugees from [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], Eastern [[Thrace]] and Southern Dobruja following the [[Second Balkan War]] and the First World War, ethnic diversity gave way to Bulgarian predominance, although sizeable minorities of [[Gagauz people|Gagauz]], Armenians, and [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic Jews]] remained for decades.

According to the 1876 census of the [[Danube Vilayet]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]], the population of Varna consisted of a majority of [[Bulgarians]] (50%) and a minority of [[Muslims]] (over 40%).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://tti.btk.mta.hu/images/2015/EM.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=9 March 2019 |archive-date=14 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114005610/https://tti.btk.mta.hu/images/2015/EM.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> A significant part were Turkish-speaking Christians ([[Gagauzes]]) who identified as Bulgarians.

According to the 1881 census in Bulgaria, the [[Turkish language]] was a mother tongue for 8903 people (36.25%), for 6721 was the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] (27.36%), for 5,367 was Greek (21.85%) and Tatar for 837 (3.41%). By ethnic group, ethnic Bulgarians were then 6,714, of whom 4478 men and 2236 women.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chernomore.bg/jivot/2016-02-02/kak-dedite-ni-slozhiha-balgarski-pechat-na-varna|title=Как дедите ни сложиха "български печат" на Варна|access-date=26 August 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625092104/http://www.chernomore.bg/jivot/2016-02-02/kak-dedite-ni-slozhiha-balgarski-pechat-na-varna|archive-date=25 June 2016}}</ref>

In 2016 the unemployment rate is 3.5% and the average salary is nearly 900lv (450€) per month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chernomore.bg/obshtestvo/2017-02-14/srednata-zaplata-vav-varna-e-915-lv|title=Cherno more employment|publisher=Chernomore.bg|access-date=1 March 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302025350/http://www.chernomore.bg/obshtestvo/2017-02-14/srednata-zaplata-vav-varna-e-915-lv|archive-date=2 March 2017}}</ref>
The economy is service-based, with 61% of net revenue generated in trade and tourism, 16% in manufacturing, 14% in transportation and communications, and 6% in construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.varna.bg/invest/iconom.htm |title=-Община Варна- |publisher=Varna.bg |access-date=6 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009221617/http://www.varna.bg/invest/iconom.htm |archive-date=9 October 2008 }}</ref> Financial services, particularly banking, insurance, investment management, and real-estate finance are booming. As of December 2008, the fallout of the global financial crisis has not yet been hard. The city is the easternmost destination of [[Pan-European corridors|Pan-European transport corridor]] 8 and is connected to corridors 7 and 9 via Rousse. Major industries traditionally include transportation ([[Navibulgar]], [[Port of Varna]], [[Varna Airport]]), distribution (Logistics Park Varna<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.propertywisebulgaria.com/article/logistic-park-varna-received-first-class-investor-certificate/id_562/catid_12 |title=Logistic Park Varna received First Class Investor Certificate – Daily News Article |publisher=Propertywisebulgaria.com |date=8 February 2008 |access-date=6 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212061259/http://www.propertywisebulgaria.com/article/logistic-park-varna-received-first-class-investor-certificate/id_562/catid_12 |archive-date=12 December 2007 }}</ref>), [[shipbuilding]] (see also [[Oceanic-Creations]]), ship repair,<ref>{{cite web|title=Odessos Shipyard Varna|url=http://www.odessos-yard.bg/|website=Odessos Shiprepair Yard|access-date=5 August 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731145421/http://www.odessos-yard.bg/|archive-date=31 July 2016}}</ref> and other marine industries.

The largest port in Bulgaria is the [[Port of Varna]] through which over 7m tonnes of freight moves annually.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://port-varna.bg/content/10/files/GFO-2020.pdf |title=Annual Financial Report  |access-date=2022-06-25 |language=bg |publisher=Port Varna |date= }}</ref> 

In June 2007, [[Eni]] and [[Gazprom]] disclosed the [[South Stream]] project whereby a {{convert|900|km|mi|0|abbr=off|adj=mid|-long}} offshore natural gas pipeline from Russia's [[Dzhubga]] with annual capacity of {{convert|63|e9m|e9ft|0|abbr=off}} was planned to come ashore at Varna, possibly near the Galata offshore gas field, en route to Italy and Austria. Nevertheless, the project was stopped due to the EU-Russia conflict.

With the nearby towns of [[Beloslav]] and [[Devnya]], Varna forms the [[Varna-Devnya Industrial Complex]], home to some of the largest chemical, thermal power, and manufacturing facilities in Bulgaria, including Varna Thermal Power Plant and ''Sodi Devnya'', the two largest cash privatisation deals in the country's recent history. There are also notable facilities for radio navigation devices, household appliances, security systems, textiles, apparel, food and beverages, printing, and other industries. Some manufacturing veterans are giving way to post-industrial developments: an ECE shopping mall is taking the place of the former VAMO diesel engine works and the Varna Brewery is being replaced by a convention centre.

Tourism is of foremost importance with the suburban beachfront resorts of [[Golden Sands]], [[Riviera, Varna Province|Riviera Holiday Club]], Sunny Day, [[Saints Constantine and Helena, Bulgaria|Saints Constantine and Helena]] attracting around 1 million foreign tourists in 2016. The resorts received considerable internal and foreign investment in the late 1990s and early in the first decade of the 21st century, and are environmentally sound, being located reassuringly far from chemical and other smokestack industries. Varna is also Bulgaria's only international [[cruise ship|cruise]] destination with 36 cruises for 2014 and a major international conference and SPA centre. Varna South Bay is also becoming a popular area for tourists

The highest building in the city is [[Interhotel Cherno More]] at 72.2 meters.

Real estate boomed in 2003–2008 with some of the highest prices in the country, by fall 2007 surpassing Sofia. In 2017 Varna is second in terms of construction projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.varna24.bg/novini/varna/Varna-vtora-v-stranata-po-predstoyashto-stroitelstvo-na-novi-zhilishta-702128|title=Варна втора в страната по предстоящо строителство на нови жилища|website=varna24.bg|access-date=27 April 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901114724/https://www.varna24.bg/novini/varna/Varna-vtora-v-stranata-po-predstoyashto-stroitelstvo-na-novi-zhilishta-702128|archive-date=1 September 2017}}</ref>

In retail, the city not only has the assortment of international big-box retailers, now found in larger Bulgarian cities, but boasts made-in-Varna national chains with locations spreading over the country such as retailer [[Piccadilly (supermarket chain)|Piccadilly]], the famous restaurant chain ''Happy'' and pharmacy chain ''Sanita''. [[Mall Varna]], Grand Mall and Delta Planet Mall are the three largest shopping centres in Varna, turning the city into an attractive shopping destination. The city has many of the finest eateries in the nation and abounds in ethnic food places.
There is a plethora of Internet cafes and many places, including parks, are covered by free public wireless internet service. Varna is connected to other Black Sea cities by the submarine [[BSFOCS|Black Sea Fibre Optic Cable System]].

In 2016 Varna won the vote of Darik Radio listeners and was awarded "Best city to live" and "Protector of History".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://varnautre.bg/2016/04/22/12274/%d0%b2%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%bd%d0%b0-%d0%b5-%d0%bd%d0%b0%d0%b9-%d0%b4%d0%be%d0%b1%d1%8a%d1%80-%d0%b3%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b4-%d0%b7%d0%b0-%d0%b6%d0%b8%d0%b2%d0%b5%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b5-%d0%b8-%d0%bf%d0%b0%d0%b7|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906040439/http://varnautre.bg/2016/04/22/12274/%d0%b2%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%bd%d0%b0-%d0%b5-%d0%bd%d0%b0%d0%b9-%d0%b4%d0%be%d0%b1%d1%8a%d1%80-%d0%b3%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b4-%d0%b7%d0%b0-%d0%b6%d0%b8%d0%b2%d0%b5%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b5-%d0%b8-%d0%bf%d0%b0%d0%b7|url-status=dead|title=Варна е "Най-добър град за живеене" и "Пазител на историята"|archive-date=6 September 2017|access-date=27 September 2019}}</ref>

Varna is accessible by air ([[Varna Airport|Varna International Airport]]), sea ([[Port of Varna]] Cruise Terminal), railway ([[Varna railway station|Central railway station]]), bus, and road.

Major roads include [[European roads]] Varna – [[Bucharest]] [[European route E70|E70]], Varna – [[Istanbul]] [[European route E87|E87]] and Varna – [[Constanta]], Romania; national motorways Varna – [[Sofia]] A2 ([[Hemus motorway]]) and Varna – [[Burgas]] A5 ([[Cherno More motorway]]). 
There are bus routes to many Bulgarian and international cities from two bus terminals. There are also train, ferry and [[roll-on/roll-off]] services to [[Odesa]], Ukraine, [[Port Kavkaz]], Russia, [[Poti]] and [[Batumi]], Georgia.

The public transport system is managed by "City Transport Varna" and has been recently modernised. Ticket prices are reasonable: from 1lv (0.50€) for city zones to 3lv (1.50€) for routes Varna – [[Golden Sands]]. Along with local buses, [[Trolleybuses in Varna|trolleybuses]], fixed-route minibus lines, there is also a large fleet of taxis.

In 2021, a light rail (LRT) system was proposed by the municipality. It is expected to connect the airport with the central part of the city, with several underground sections and stations. The funding will be provided by the EU programmes.

== Landmarks ==
[[File:VarnaArchMuseum.JPG|thumb|The [[Varna Archaeological Museum|Archaeological Museum]] occupies an ornate 19th-century former girls' school]]

The 'Sea Garden' is the oldest and perhaps largest park in town containing an open-air theatre (venue of the International Ballet Competition, opera performances and concerts), [[Varna Aquarium]] (opened 1932), the Festa Dolphinarium (opened 1984), the Nicolaus Copernicus Observatory and Planetarium, the Museum of Natural History, a terrarium, a zoo, an alpineum, a children's amusement park with a pond, boathouse and ice-skating rink, and other attractions. The National Revival Alley is decorated with bronze monuments to prominent Bulgarians, and the Cosmonauts' Alley contains trees planted by [[Yuri Gagarin]] and other Soviet and Bulgarian [[cosmonaut]]s. The Garden is a national monument of landscape architecture and is said to be the largest landscaped park in the Balkans.

The waterfront promenade is lined by a string of beach clubs offering a vibrant scene of rock, hip-hop, Bulgarian and American-style pop, techno, and [[chalga]]. In October 2006, ''[[The Independent]]'' dubbed Varna "Europe's new funky-town, the good-time capital of Bulgaria".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://travel.independent.co.uk/europe/article1778375.ece |title=Bulgaria: Get the party started – Europe, Travel – The Independent |work=The Independent |date=1 October 2006 |access-date=6 May 2009 |location=London |first=Nick |last=Clark |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029175202/http://travel.independent.co.uk/europe/article1778375.ece |archive-date=29 October 2007 }}</ref> The city enjoys a nationwide reputation for its rock, hip-hop, world music, and other artists, clubs, and related events such as [[July Morning]] and international rock and hip-hop (including graffiti<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beachbulgaria.com/varna/news/grafitti_festival_en.html |title=Graffiti Festival Organized in Varna resort, Bulgaria |publisher=Beachbulgaria.com |date=26 May 2006 |access-date=6 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331122717/http://www.beachbulgaria.com/varna/news/grafitti_festival_en.html |archive-date=31 March 2008 }}</ref>) venues.

[[File:Euxinograd-palace-benkovski.png|thumb|[[Euxinograd]] palace]]

The city beaches, also known as ''sea baths'' (морски бани, ''morski bani''), are dotted with hot (up to 55°С/131&nbsp;°F) sulphuric mineral water sources (used for spas, swimming pools and public showers) and punctured by small sheltered marinas. Additionally, the {{convert|2.05|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|52|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high [[Asparuhov most]] bridge is a popular spot for [[bungee jumping]]. Outside the city are the [[Euxinograd]] palace, park and winery, the [[University of Sofia]] Botanical Garden (Ecopark Varna), the [[Pobiti Kamani]] rock phenomenon, and the medieval [[cave monastery]], [[Aladzha Monastery|Aladzha]].

Tourist shopping areas include the boutique rows along Prince Boris Blvd (with retail rents rivalling Vitosha Blvd in Sofia) and adjacent pedestrian streets, as well as the large mall and big-box cluster in the Mladost district, suitable for motorists. Two other shopping plazas, Piccadilly Park and Central Plaza, are conveniently located to serve tourists in the resorts north of the city centre, both driving and riding the public transit. ATMs and 24/7 gas stations with convenience stores abound.

[[File:Museum of the history Varna.jpg|thumb|Varna History Museum]]

Food markets, among others, include supermarket chains [[Billa (supermarket)|Billa]], [[Kaufland]] and [[Metro AG|Metro]]. In stores and restaurants, credit cards are normally accepted. There is a number of farmers markets offering fresh local produce; the Kolkhozen Pazar, the largest one, also has a fresh fish market but is located in a crowded area virtually inaccessible for cars.

Like other cities in the region, Varna has its share of stray dogs, calm and friendly, flashing orange clips on the ears showing they have been castrated and vaccinated. However, urban wildlife is dominated by the ubiquitous seagulls, while brown squirrels inhabit the Sea Garden. Cats are also everywhere in the city. In January and February, migrating swans winter on the sheltered beaches.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/4670136.stm |title=In Pictures &#124; Day in pictures |work=BBC News |date=1 February 2006 |access-date=6 May 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402063610/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/4670136.stm |archive-date=2 April 2012 }}</ref>

[[File:Catedral de la Dormición de la Madre de Dios, Varna, Bulgaria, 2016-05-27, DD 115-116 HDR.jpg|thumb|Interior of the Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral]]

Notable old Bulgarian [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]] temples include the metropolitan Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral (of the diocese of Varna and Veliki [[Preslav]]); the early-17th-century Theotokos Panagia (built on the site of an earlier church where Ladislaus III was perhaps buried); the [[Athanasius of Alexandria|St. Athanasius]] (former [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Greek]] metropolitan cathedral) on the footprint of a razed 10th-century church; the 15th-century [[Parascheva of the Balkans|St. Petka Parashkeva]] chapel; the seamen's church of [[Saint Nicholas]]; the [[Archangel Michael]] chapel, site of the first Bulgarian secular school from the National Revival era; and the Sts. [[Constantine I|Constantine]] and [[Helena of Constantinople|Helena]] church of the 14th-century suburban monastery of the same name.

The remains of a large 4th- to 5th-century stronghold basilica in Dzhanavara Park just south of town are becoming a tourist destination with some exquisite mosaics displayed ''in situ''. The remains of another massive 9th-century basilica adjacent to the scriptorium at Boris I's Theotokos Panagia monastery are being excavated and conserved. A 4th- to 5th-century episcopal basilica north of the Thermae is also being restored. There is also a number of newer Orthodox temples; two, dedicated to apostle Andrew and the local martyr St. Procopius of Varna, are currently under construction. Many smaller Orthodox chapels have mushroomed in the area. In early 2009, Vasil Danev, leader of the ethnic Organization of the United Roma Communities (FORO), said local Roma would also erect an Orthodox chapel.

There is an [[Armenian Apostolic]] church; two Roman Catholic churches, a thriving [[United Methodist Church|Evangelical Methodist]] episcopal church offering organ concerts, active [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] [[Pentecostal]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]], and two [[Baptism|Baptist]] churches.

Two old mosques (one is open) have survived since Ottoman times, when there were 18 of them in town, as have two once stately but now dilapidated synagogues, a [[Sephardi]]c and an [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic]] one, the latter in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style (it is undergoing restoration). A new mosque was recently added in the southern Asparuhovo district serving the adjacent [[Muslim Roma]] neighbourhood.

There is also a [[Buddhist]] centre.

On a different note, spiritual master [[Peter Deunov]] started preaching his [[Esoteric Christianity]] doctrine in Varna in the late 1890s, and, in 1899–1908, the yearly meetings of his Synarchic Chain, later known as the Universal White Brotherhood, were convened there.

=== Architecture ===
[[File:Varna Bulgaria architecture.jpg|thumb|[[Art Nouveau]] mansion on Prince Boris I Boulevard]]
[[File:Chaika district in Varna.JPG|thumb|Chaika apartment complex, the socialist showcase for the 1972 World Congress of Architecture]]

By 1878, Varna was an Ottoman city of mostly wooden houses in a style characteristic of the Black Sea coast, densely packed along narrow, winding lanes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://auction-victoria.com/image.asp?image=4358 |title=Archived copy |access-date=22 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425235724/http://auction-victoria.com/image.asp?image=4358 |archive-date=25 April 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://catalog.libvar.bg/view/show_jpg_image.pl?MATERIAL=photo&image_id=67115563.401251512462638592429 |title=Archived copy |access-date=22 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425235727/http://catalog.libvar.bg/view/show_jpg_image.pl?MATERIAL=photo&image_id=67115563.401251512462638592429 |archive-date=25 April 2012 }}</ref> It was surrounded by a stone wall restored in the 1830s with a citadel, a moat, ornamented iron gates flanked by towers, and a vaulted stone bridge across the River Varna. The place abounded in pre-Ottoman relics, ancient ruins were widely used as stone quarries.

Today, very little of this legacy remains; the city centre was rebuilt by the nascent Bulgarian middle class in late 19th and early 20th centuries in Western style with local interpretations of [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]], [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neo-Baroque]], [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassicism]], [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]] (many of those buildings, whose ownership was restored after 1989, underwent renovations).

Stone masonry from demolished city walls was used for the cathedral, the two elite high schools, and for paving new boulevards. The middle class built practical townhouses and coop buildings. Elegant mansions were erected on main boulevards and in the vineyards north of town. A few industrial working-class suburbs (of one-family cottages with small green yards) emerged. Refugees from the 1910s wars also settled in similar poorer yet vibrant neighbourhoods along the city edges.

During the rapid urbanisation of the 1960s to the early 1980s, large apartment complexes sprawled onto land formerly covered by small private vineyards or agricultural cooperatives as the city population tripled. Beach resorts were designed mostly in a sleek modern style, which was somewhat lost in their recent more lavish renovations. Modern landmarks of the 1960s include the [[Palace of Culture and Sports]], built in 1968.

With the country's return to capitalism since 1989, upscale apartment buildings mushroomed both downtown and on uptown terraces overlooking the sea and the lake. Varna's vineyards (лозя, ''lozya''), dating back perhaps to antiquity and stretching for miles around, started turning from mostly rural grounds dotted with summer houses or ''villa'' into affluent suburbs sporting opulent villas and family hotels, epitomised by the researched [[Postmodern architecture|postmodernist]] kitsch of the Villa Aqua.

With the new suburban construction far outpacing infrastructure growth, ancient landslides were activated, temporarily disrupting major highways. As the number of vehicles quadrupled since 1989, Varna became known for traffic jams; parking on the old town's leafy but narrow streets normally takes the sidewalks. At the same time, stretches of [[shanty town]]s, more befitting Rio de Janeiro, remain in [[Romani people|Romani]] neighbourhoods on the western edge of town due to complexities of local politics.

The beach resorts were rebuilt and expanded, fortunately without being as heavily overdeveloped as were other tourist destinations on the [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast]], and their greenery was mostly preserved. New modern office buildings started reshaping the old centre and the city's surroundings.<ref>{{cite web
