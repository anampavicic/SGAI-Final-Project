The city's population was 127,647 at the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], making it the [[List of cities and towns in the San Francisco Bay Area|eighth-most populous city in the Bay Area]]. Located in the southern [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]], the city was founded by the Spanish in 1777 with the establishment of [[Mission Santa Clara de Asís]] under the leadership of [[Junípero Serra]].

Santa Clara is located in the center of [[Silicon Valley]] and is home to the headquarters of companies such as [[Intel]], [[Advanced Micro Devices]], and [[Nvidia]]. It is also home to [[Santa Clara University]], the oldest university in California,<ref>"[https://www.scu.edu/stclaregarden/ethno/stclare.cfm Santa Clara University Ethnobiographical Background] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528132701/http://www.scu.edu/stclaregarden/ethno/stclare.cfm|date=May 28, 2010}}." [[Santa Clara University]]. Retrieved on March 13, 2010.</ref> and [[Levi's Stadium]], the home of the [[National Football League]]'s [[San Francisco 49ers]], and [[Six Flags Entertainment Corporation]]'s [[California's Great America]] Park. Santa Clara is bordered by [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] on all sides, except for [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]] and [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]] to the west.

==History==
Prior to the arrival of Europeans in the 18th century, the [[Tamien people|Tamien tribe]] of the [[Ohlone]] nation of [[Indigenous Californian]]s had inhabited the area for several millennia.

===Spanish period===
The first European to visit the valley was [[José Francisco Ortega]] in 1769. The Spanish began to colonize California with 21 [[California Missions|missions]], and the [[Mission Santa Clara de Asís]] was founded in 1777.

===Mexican period===
The [[Battle of Santa Clara (1847)|Battle of Santa Clara]], one of the last battles of the [[Conquest of California]], was fought between a contingent of [[Californios]], led by [[Francisco Sánchez (American politician)|Francisco Sánchez]], against the invading American forces.

===American period===
[[File:Mission Santa Clara de Asís (1849; oil on canvas).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|[[Mission Santa Clara de Asís]] was founded by the Spanish in 1777.]]
[[File:Battle_of_Santa_Clara,_California_(cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|The 1847 [[Battle of Santa Clara (1847)|Battle of Santa Clara]], fought between the Americans and the [[Californios]], was one of the last battles of the [[Conquest of California]].]]
In 1851, [[Santa Clara College]] was established on the grounds of the original Mission. In 1852, Santa Clara was [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a town; it became state-chartered by 1862.

For the next century, the economy centered on agriculture since orchards and vegetables were thriving in the fertile soil. By the beginning of the 20th century, the population had reached 5,000 and stayed about the same for many years.

In 1905, the first public high-altitude flights by humans were made over Santa Clara in gliders designed by [[John J. Montgomery]]. The [[semiconductor industry]], which sprouted around 1960, changed the city and surrounding [[Santa Clara Valley|Valley of Heart's Delight]]; little of its agricultural past remains.

Santa Clara's first medical hospital was built in 1963. This structure, on Kiely Boulevard, was replaced in 2007 with a new Kaiser Permanente medical center located on Lawrence Expressway at Homestead Road.

Santa Clara was also home to a major mental health facility, [[Agnews State Hospital]]. According to the National Park Service, more than 100 persons were killed at this site in the 1906 earthquake. The site is the former home to [[Sun Microsystems]] and is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

In 1963, Santa Clara City Council voted to knock down the eight-block grid of Downtown Santa Clara, in order to receive federal funding for [[urban renewal]].<ref>'' Santa Clara Journal'' microfilm, Santa Clara, California Wednesday, January 2, 1963, First (Front) page, Article: Renewal Hits Homestretch, Vol 91 No. 9, Santa Clara City Public Library Archives in Santa Clara, CA</ref><ref>Santa Clara City Urban Renewal: Home Movie Clips 1963–1966 Source by Warburton, Austen; Warburton, Margot: VHS: 1 Tape of 1 Call Number: Video 979.473 S23 Case, Rights: Copyrighted.

==Geography==
[[File:View of Santa Clara University (1933).png|thumb|upright=1|left|[[Santa Clara University]] in 1933]]
Santa Clara is drained by three seasonal creeks, all of which empty into the southern portion of [[San Francisco Bay]]; these creeks are [[San Tomas Aquino Creek]], [[Saratoga Creek]], and [[Calabazas Creek (Santa Clara County)|Calabazas Creek]].

There are some significant biological resources within the city including [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] for the [[burrowing owl]], a [[species]] of special concern in California due to reduction in habitat from urban development during the latter 20th century.<ref>'' Environmental Impact Report for the Esperanca property, Santa Clara, California'', Earth Metrics Inc., California State Clearinghouse (1990)</ref> This owl uses burrows created by [[ground squirrel]]s and prefers generally level grasslands and even disturbed areas. [[Coyote]]s have also become active in the area in recent years.<ref>{{Cite web|date=November 8, 2019|title=Coexisting with Coyotes in Santa Clara|url=https://www.svvoice.com/coexisting-with-coyotes-in-santa-clara/|access-date=December 24, 2020|website=The Silicon Valley Voice|language=en-US}}</ref>

According to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the city covers an area of {{convert|18.4|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.

===Climate===
The average daily temperatures in July range from {{convert|82|F}} to {{convert|53|F}}. Winters are mild, with the mean daily temperatures in January ranging from {{convert|58|F}} to {{convert|38|F}}. Most of the annual rainfall comes in the winter months; the summer months are generally rainless.

Santa Clara owns and operates an electric utility called [[Silicon Valley Power]]. In 2005 Silicon Valley Power brought online the [[Donald Von Raesfeld Power Plant|Donald Von Raesfeld (DVR) Power Plant]].
