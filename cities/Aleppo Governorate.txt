'''Aleppo Governorate''' ({{langx|ar|محافظة حلب}} / [[ALA-LC]]: ''Muḥāfaẓat Ḥalab'' / {{IPA|ar|muˈħaːfaðˤat ˈħalab|}}) is one of the fourteen [[Governorates of Syria|governorates]] of [[Syria]]. It is the most populous governorate in Syria with a population of more than 4,867,000 (2011 Est.), almost 23% of the total population of Syria. The governorate is the fifth in area with an area of {{convert|18482|km2||abbr=on}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alp-city.org/aleppohistory.php |title=History of Aleppo |website=الموقع الرسمي لمجلس مدينة حلب |language=ar |script-title=ar:تاريخ حلب |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723173514/http://www.alp-city.org/aleppohistory.php |archive-date=2013-07-23 |url-status=dead |access-date=2017-12-20}}</ref> or 18,498 km<sup>2</sup>,<ref name="Statoids">{{cite web |url=http://www.statoids.com/usy.html |title=Syria Provinces |website=statoids.com}}</ref> about 10% of the total area of Syria. The capital is the city of [[Aleppo]].

== History ==
=== Ancient ===
In [[Classical antiquity]], the region was made up of three regions: Chalybonitis (with its centre at Chalybon or Aleppo), Chalcidice (with its center at [[Qinnasrin]] العيس), and [[Cyrrhestica]] (with its center at [[Cyrrhus]] النبي حوري).{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} This was the most fertile and populated region in Syria. Under the Romans, the region was made in 193 CE{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} part of the province of [[Coele-Syria]] or Magna Syria, which was ruled from [[Antioch]]. The province of [[Euphratensis]] was established in the 4th century CE in the east, its centre was Hierapolis Bambyce ([[Manbij]]).<ref name='kazhdan'>{{cite book |editor-first=Alexander |editor-last=Kazhdan |title=[[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-19-504652-6 |pages=748}}</ref>

Under the [[Rashidun]] and Umayyad Muslim dynasties, the region was part of the [[Jund Qinnasrin]].<ref name="LeStrange1890">{{cite book |title=Palestine Under the Moslems: A Description of Syria and the Holy Land from A.D. 650 to 1500 |url=https://archive.org/details/palestineundermo00lestuoft |author1=Ad-Dimashqi |author-link=Shams al-Din al-Ansari al-Dimashqi |author2=Al-Muqaddasi |author2-link=Al-Muqaddasi |publisher=Committee of the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] |location=[[London]] |year=1890 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/palestineundermo00lestuoft/page/25 25]–39 |oclc=1004386}}</ref> In the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] period the region was under the independent rule of the [[Hamdanid dynasty|Hamdanids]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} The [[Mamluk]]s and then later the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] governed the area until 1918; under the Ottomans, the region was part of the [[Aleppo vilayet|Vilayet of Aleppo]].<ref name="Masters2013">{{cite book |author=Bruce Masters |title=The Arabs of the Ottoman Empire, 1516-1918: A Social and Cultural History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4x09OvMBMmgC&pg=PA181 |access-date=2013-06-08 |date=2013-04-29 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-03363-4 |pages=181}}</ref>

=== Modern history ===
During the [[Tanzimat|Tanzimat era]] of Ottoman governance in Aleppo, the authorities established the 1858 land reform law along with schemes to introduce new [[Bedouin]] settlers to northern Syria. These programs led to a stronger integration of Aleppo with the economy of the Ottoman heartland in [[Anatolia]]. It also paved the way for European capitalists to exploit agricultural resources of the region and caused internal trade to shift into the hands of European merchants.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Masters |first=Bruce |date=2010 |title=The Political Economy of Aleppo in an Age of Ottoman Reform

In the early 20th century, during the [[French Mandate of Syria|French Mandate]] the region was part of the short-lived [[State of Aleppo]].<ref>[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Syria.html Syria: French Levant States 1920-1936]</ref>

Aleppo Governorate formerly included [[Idlib Governorate]], until the latter was split off circa 1960.<ref name="Statoids"/>

=== Syrian Civil War (2011-present) ===
The governorate has been the scene of some of the fiercest fighting in the [[Syrian Civil War]]. In June 2017, nearly six years after the war's start, the province was almost equally divided between Syrian Government forces, Syrian Opposition forces, Turkish Army /[[Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army|TFSA]]  and the [[Rojava]]/[[Syrian Democratic Forces]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} After fierce fighting, the Syrian Arab Army with Russian air support managed to take control of the capital of the Governorate, Aleppo, in December 2016 from Fatah Halab coalition.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

In August 2016, the [[Turkish Army]], backed by the [[Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army|Free Syrian Army]] launched the [[Operation Euphrates Shield]] in order to drive [[ISIL]] from the border towns of [[Jarablus]], [[A'zaz]] and [[Al-Bab]]. The operation resulted in success and starting in May 2017, the region is now under [[Turkish occupation of Northern Syria|Turkish occupation]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stein |first1=Aaron |last2=Abouzahr |first2=Hossam |last3=Komar |first3=Rao |title=How Turkey Is Governing in Northern Aleppo |url=https://www.newsdeeply.com/syria/community/2017/07/20/how-turkey-is-governing-in-northern-aleppo |website=Syria Deeply |date=20 July 2017 |access-date=14 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.voanews.com/a/skirmishes-mar-fight-against-islamic-state-in-northern-syia/3747121.html |title=Skirmishes Mar Fight Against IS in Northern Syria |work=[[Voice of America]] |author=Sirwan Kajjo |date=2 March 2017 |quote=Turkish occupation "is an existential threat to the Assad government's ability to reclaim the entirety of its territory, which is a key argument that regime loyalists make in their support of Bashar al-Assad's government", Heras said.}}</ref> The [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] was largely removed from the area after the Syrian Arab Army launched the [[East Aleppo offensive (January–April 2017)|East Aleppo Offensive]], the [[Maskanah Plains offensive]], and the [[Southern Raqqa offensive (June 2017)|Southern Raqqa Offensive]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

In January 2018, the Turkish army backed by the Free Syrian Army launched the [[Turkish military operation in Afrin]] against the [[YPG]], which resulted in the capture of the city of [[Afrin, Syria|Afrin]] and the entire [[Afrin District]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-takes-full-control-syrias-afrin-region-reports-say-411255038 |title=Turkey takes full control of Syria's Afrin region, reports say |access-date=3 June 2018}}</ref>

== Geography ==
The governorate has a {{convert|221|km||adj=on}} long{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} northern boundary with the [[Kilis Province|Kilis]], [[Gaziantep Province|Gaziantep]], and [[Şanlıurfa Province|Şanlıurfa]] provinces of [[Turkey]]. To the east lies [[Raqqa Governorate]], to the south [[Hama Governorate|Ḥamā Governorate]], and to the west [[Idlib Governorate]] and Turkey's [[Hatay Province]].

The governorate lies on a plateau known as the [[Aleppo plateau]]. The eastern and northern boundaries of the governorate correspond roughly to the eastern and northern boundaries of the plateau, although the northeastern portion of the governorate crosses the [[Euphrates]] valley into the [[Al Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazīrah]] plateau. The southeastern end of the governorate is continuous with the arid steppe of the northern [[Syrian Desert]]. To the south lie the eastern plains of Hama, and to the southwest lie the northern plains of Idlib.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

The average elevation of the terrain is {{convert|379|m|ft}}. The surface gradually slopes down in north–south and west–east directions, undulating gently with an amplitude of 10–30 m for each wave. The lowlands are covered with combined [[Paleozoic]] and [[Mesozoic]] sediments that average 4–5 km in thickness over the whole surface.<ref>Abd as-Salam, Adil (1991) General Geography of Syria (Arabic)</ref>

[[File:ALEPPO GOVERNORATE GEOGRAPHY.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Geographic features of northwestern Syria]]

Starting from the valley of the Euphrates, the terrain rises forming the Manbij plain, and then sinks again at the [[Dhahab river]] valley in the east of Aleppo Governorate. The Dhahab drains the highlands north of [[Al-Bab|Bāb]] and runs in a north–south direction for about {{convert|50|km||abbr=on}} until it drains into [[Lake Jabboul]]. West of the Dhahab valley the terrain rises again forming Mount 'Aqīl (Mount Taymar) west of Bāb and Mount Ḥaṣṣ west of Lake Jabboul.<ref name="Birdlife">[http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SitHTMDetails.asp&sid=8297 "SY006: Sabkhat al-Jabbul"] BirdLife IBA Factsheet</ref> The terrain sinks again forming the valley of River [[Quwēq]]. The endpoint of Quwēq, the Maṭkh swamp ({{convert|249|m|ft}}), is the lowest point in Aleppo Governorate. West of the Quwēq is [[Mount Simeon]]. South of Mount Simeon is the plains of Idlib. The [[Afrin River|river 'Afrīn]] runs west of Mount Simeon. To the west of river 'Afrīn, the land rises again forming [[Kurd-Dagh|Mount Kurd]]. The highest point in the governorate, Mount Bulbul ({{convert|1269|m|ft}}), is located in the northern part of Mount Kurd. River 'Ifrīn runs from north to south between Mount Simeon and Mount Kurd and then turns west to the Orontes valley, thus separating Mount Kurd from [[Harim mountains|Mount Ḥārim]] to the south.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

The governorate is generally deforested except for a dispersed forest of about {{convert|50|km2}} on the eastern slope of Mount Kurd where it faces the plain of [[A'zaz]]. The main trees are [[Pinus halepensis|Aleppo pine]] and [[oak]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

Arable land makes up 66% of the total area in the governorate. The main crops are olives, figs, plums, pomegranates, vegetables, grains, rice, and pistachios. Pistachio is called in Syria ''fustuq Ḥalabī'' (Aleppo pistachio). Rivers traditionally supported agriculture; the main rivers in Aleppo are the Quwēq, 'Ifrīn, [[Sajur River|Sājūr]], Dhahab, [[Karasu (Hatay)|Aswad]], and Euphrates. However, all of these rivers arise in Turkey, and due to irrigation projects on the Turkish side of the border, the flow of these rivers dropped so much that most of them could no longer support agriculture. The Quwēq, for example, dried up completely in the 1950s. The vanishing of the rivers forced farmers to depend largely on rainfall and on water diverted from the Euphrates. A pumping station at [[Maskanah]] (95 km east of Aleppo) provides drinking water for Aleppo from the Euphrates. Recently Euphrates water has been diverted to revive the dead Qwēq river, and thus revive agriculture in the plains south of Aleppo. Urban areas, highlands, swamps, forests, and grazing land make up 34% of the total area of the governorate. The remaining 14% is a desert area in the southeast that is continuous with the Syrian Desert and known as the Aleppo Desert (Arabic: بادية حلب).{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

The largest lake in the governorate is [[Sabkhat al-Jabbul|lake Sabkhat al-Jabbul]], a [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] salt lake located {{convert|40|km}} southeast of Aleppo. [[Lake Assad]] (the largest lake in Syria) separates Aleppo Governorate from Raqqa Governorate. Other artificial lakes include the Lake of 17 April on the River Ifrīn and the revived Shabā Lake on River Quwēq.

Archaeological sites are abundant in the governorate, especially at [[Mount Simeon]] in the west and the plains that extend beyond towards [[Antioch]] and [[Idlib]]. This region, known as the [[Limestone Massif]], has the largest concentration of Late Antiquity churches in the world, with a unique Syrian architectural style.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3284/is_289_75/ai_n28865005/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709153840/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3284/is_289_75/ai_n28865005/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-09 |title=FindArticles.com - CBSi}}</ref> It also has the famous [[Dead Cities]] of Syria.<ref>Darke, Diana (2006) ''Syria'' p. 132</ref>

=== Climate ===
Aleppo Governorate has a semi-arid climate. The mountain series that runs along the Mediterranean coast, namely Mount Alawites and Mount Amanus, largely block the effects of the [[Mediterranean]] on climate (rain shadow effect).{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} The average temperature in the governorate is {{Convert|15-20|C|}}. The average precipitation ranges from {{convert|500|mm|0|abbr=on}} in the western parts of the governorate to {{convert|200|mm|0|abbr=on}} in the easternmost parts and {{convert|150|mm|0|abbr=on}} in the southeastern desert. 80% of precipitation occurs between October and March. Snow is usually in winter. The average humidity is 60% in the west and 55% in the east.
