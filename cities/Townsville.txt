[[James Cook]] visited the Townsville region on his first voyage to Australia in 1770, but did not land there. Cook named nearby Cape Cleveland, [[Cleveland Bay (Queensland)|Cleveland Bay]] and [[Magnetic Island|Magnetic(al) Island]].<ref name="history">{{cite web|title=A Chronological History of Townsville 1770 to 1900 |publisher=[[City of Townsville|Townsville City Council]] |date=2 November 2008 |url=http://www.townsville.qld.gov.au/townsville/heritage/Pages/chronology.aspx |access-date=20 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220115648/http://townsville.qld.gov.au/townsville/heritage/Pages/chronology.aspx |archive-date=20 February 2011 }}</ref>

In 1819, Captain [[Phillip Parker King]] and botanist [[Allan Cunningham (botanist)|Alan Cunningham]] were the first Europeans to record a local landing.<ref name="history" />

In 1846, [[James Morrill (castaway)|James Morrill]] was shipwrecked from the ''Peruvian'', living in the Townsville area among the Bindal people for 17&nbsp;years before deciding to return to British society when the frontier of colonisation came to the region.<ref>{{cite web|author=corporateName=Queensland State Archives|title=Number 55 – Statement by James Morrill [Morrell] (1863)|url=http://www.archives.qld.gov.au/Researchers/Exhibitions/Top150/051-075/Pages/055.aspx|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413011451/http://archives.qld.gov.au/Researchers/Exhibitions/Top150/051-075/Pages/055.aspx|archive-date=13 April 2016|access-date=10 August 2020|website=Number 55 – Statement by James Morrill [Morrell] (1863)|date=7 April 2015|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref name="history"/>

In 1860, [[George Elphinstone Dalrymple]] led a maritime expedition to the region from Brisbane. The expedition sailed to [[Cleveland Bay (Queensland)|Cleveland Bay]], finding a very numerous Aboriginal population. They landed on the shore near to where the modern city of Townsville now stands and met with a number of Aboriginal people, giving them biscuit and tobacco. The Aboriginal people started to touch and feel all the expedition members, and began "smacking their lips", which Dalrymple interpreted as an indication that they wanted to eat them. Another group of Aboriginal people came down, attacking them with a shower of stones and spears. Dalrymple and his men "were necessitated" to fire upon them, "repulsing them with loss." They landed again near to [[Cape Pallarenda Conservation Park|Cape Pallarenda]] to obtain surveys from the hilltops but decided to descend to their awaiting dinghies as they noticed residents of three Aboriginal camps below were moving in their direction. These people were yelling and dancing "in a very hostile manner" and Dalrymple felt obliged to fire upon them. Dalrymple's group then made an "orderly retreat" to the dinghies halting at intervals to fire upon those throwing spears. The crew which had remained upon the ''Spitfire'' had seen about eight armed Aboriginal men in canoes approaching them from nearby [[Magnetic Island]] in an apparent attempt to board the ship. They were repulsed by a discharge of the brass gun.<ref name="spitfire">{{cite book |title=Report of the Proceedings of the Queensland Government schooner Spitfire |date=1860 |publisher=T.P.

Edward Kennedy, a [[Native Police]] officer accompanying the group, recalled how his "boys" (the Aboriginal troopers) chased four or five local tribesmen into the ocean. Kennedy then stated that he "left the "boys" in the water, pumping lead and hurling derisive cries at them, neither of which seemed to reach their mark". A member of the expedition who was from a town in the south accidentally shot dead an elderly Aboriginal man. He said that he thought he was being stalked by an alligator. On the return journey to Port Denison, the group "dispersed" another Aboriginal camp in reprisal for the killing of a shepherd. After the fighting, the "boys" rounded up around 12 women and each took turns based on their rank in selecting one. "In five minutes, each had chosen their spouse and the ceremony was complete."<ref>{{Citation | author1=Kennedy, E. B.

The next group of colonists, led by W. A. Ross, arrived at Cleveland Bay from Woodstock Station on 5 November of that year. In 1866 Robert Towns visited for three days, his first and only visit. He agreed to provide ongoing financial assistance to the new settlement and Townsville was named in his honour.<ref name="history"/> Townsville was declared a municipality in February 1866, with John Melton Black elected as its first Mayor.<ref name="history"/> Townsville developed rapidly as the major port and service centre for the [[Australian gold rushes#Other discoveries|Cape River]], Gilbert, [[Ravenswood, Queensland|Ravenswood]], Etheridge and [[Charters Towers]] goldfields.<ref name="wheelbarrow"/> Regional pastoral and sugar industries also expanded and flourished.

The [[Alligator Creek meatworks]] was established in 1879. Up to 1500 workers, many who resided in Townsville would work at the factory. It helped to build up the economy of Townsville. Jack Flowers was a local of Townsville and started working at Alligator Creek when he was 13 years old (in 1913).

In 1961 the [[University of Queensland]] established a campus at [[Pimlico, Queensland|Pimlico]], near [[Pimlico State High School]], later developing a site at [[Douglas, Queensland|Douglas]] near the Army Barracks, and across the new Nathan Street Bridge. The faculties of Arts, Law, and Education, and several residential colleges, Union, St Mark's, and John Flynn relocated from central Townsville. This was followed by the relocation of St Raphael's college for women. A large modernist building was established. In March 1962, first year university students painted the stick figure depicting [[The Saint (Simon Templar)|The Saint]] on Castle Hill as a prank.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ford |first1=Lyall |title=A History of The Townsville Saint |date=2022 |publisher=Taipan Press |isbn=978-0-9590776-5-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Knight |first1=Mia |last2=Naunton |first2=Jessica |title=Townsville's Castle Hill Saint story immortalised in new book about the rock graffiti |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-10-04/castle-hill-saint-story-immortalised-in-new-book/101500820 |access-date=12 September 2024}}</ref> In 1971 [[Cyclone Althea]] with flooding slowed progress of infrastructural building, but by 1972 [[James Cook University]] was established, with ecru academic gowns, quite different to those of older universities.

Following lunch on board Britannia, the royal family were driven to the site of Queensland’s newest university, the [[James Cook University]], Townsville campus. In the presence of many dignitaries, HRH Queen Elizabeth II formally granted autonomy to North Queensland’s new educational institution.

==Urban layout==
[[File:Townsville DSC08648 Qld.jpg|thumb|Townsville CBD and surrounds]]
Inner-city high-density development has also created population growth and [[gentrification]] of the central business district (CBD). One significant contributor to CBD development was the construction of a new rail passenger terminal and re-siting of the railway workshops,<ref>[http://www.dtrdi.qld.gov.au/dsdweb/v3/guis/templates/content/gui_cue_cntnhtml.cfm?id=18072 Department of Tourism, Regional Development and Industry].

In the short term, much of the urban expansion will continue to the west and the north, in the former City of Thuringowa.

==Geography==
{{For|a full list of suburbs in Townsville and the surrounding region|List of Townsville suburbs}}[[File:Ross River from Riverway.jpg|thumb|The Ross River that runs through Townsville]]
Townsville lies approximately {{convert|1350|km|mi}} north of [[Brisbane]], and {{convert|350|km|mi}} south of [[Cairns]]. It lies on the shores of Cleveland Bay, protected to some degree from the predominantly south-east weather. Cleveland Bay is mostly shallow inshore, with several large beaches and continually shifting sand bars. [[Magnetic Island]] lies {{convert|8|km|mi|0}} offshore, to the north of the city centre. It, together with Castle Hill in the town centre and Mount Stuart to the south of the city, form a large [[quartz monzonite]] igneous province.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}[[File:Castle Hill, Viewed From Townsville Breakwater..jpg|thumb|Castle Hill, a granite monolith in Townsville|left]]The [[Ross River (Queensland)|Ross River]] flows through the city. Three weirs, fish stocking and dredging of the river in these reaches has resulted in a deep, stable and clean waterway used for many recreational activities such as water skiing, fishing and rowing. {{convert|30|km|spell=In}} from the mouth (at the junction of Five Head Creek) is the [[Ross River Dam]], the major water storage for the urban areas.

The historic waterfront on [[Ross Creek (Townsville, North Queensland)|Ross Creek]], site of the original wharves and port facilities, has some old buildings mixed with the later modern skyline. However, the central city is dominated by the mass of red granite of [[Castle Hill, Townsville|Castle Hill]], {{convert|286|m|ft}} high.<ref>{{cite web|title=Townsville Community Profiles Division 3|date=March 2016|access-date=6 May 2018|page=5|url=https://www.townsville.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/12085/TCC_Community-Profiles_Division-3_Web.pdf|author=Townsville City Council|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330154733/https://www.townsville.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/12085/TCC_Community-Profiles_Division-3_Web.pdf|archive-date=30 March 2018}}</ref> There is a lookout at the summit giving panoramic views of the city and its suburbs, including Cleveland Bay and [[Magnetic Island]].

Townsville has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Aw''). Owing to a quirk of geographical location, Townsville's winter rainfall in particular is not as high as elsewhere in the eastern coastal tropics of Queensland, such as [[Cairns]].<ref name="Climate of Townsville">{{cite web |title= Climate of Townsville |publisher= Bureau of Meteorology |url= http://www.bom.gov.au/qld/townsville/climate_Townsville.shtml |access-date= 5 October 2017 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171005100637/http://www.bom.gov.au/qld/townsville/climate_Townsville.shtml |archive-date= 5 October 2017}}</ref> The winter months are dominated by southeast [[trade winds]] and mostly fine weather. Further north the coastline runs north–south and the trade winds are lifted to produce rainfall right through the year. Townsville, however, lies on a section of coastline that turns east/west, so the lifting effect is not present. As a result, winter months are dominated by blue skies, warm days and cool nights, although at times significant rainfall may occur.<ref name="Climate of Townsville"/>

The average annual rainfall is {{convert|1095|mm|in|2}} on an average 61 rain days, most of which falls during the six-month "wet season" from November to April. Because of the "hit or miss" nature of tropical lows and thunderstorms, and the powerful influence of the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]], variation from year to year is almost uniquely large for such a wet climate, being comparable only to a few cities in [[Northeast Region, Brazil|the Northeast of Brazil]] (e.g. [[Fortaleza]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dewar|first1=Robert E|last2=Wallis|first2=James R|title=Geographical patterning of interannual rainfall variability in the tropics and near tropics: An L-moments approach|journal=[[Journal of Climate]]|volume=12|issue=12|pages=3457–3466|bibcode=1999JCli...12.3457D|year=1999|doi=10.1175/1520-0442(1999)012<3457:GPOIRV>2.0.CO;2|s2cid=55652367|url=http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6a6d/680c9dab538e276ba3146bc0e1c673a3c285.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190226011120/http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6a6d/680c9dab538e276ba3146bc0e1c673a3c285.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2019-02-26}}</ref> Since records at various urban locations started in 1871 twelve-month rainfalls in Townsville have ranged from a mere {{convert|217.9|mm|in|2}} between December 1901 and November 1902 at the peak of the [[Federation Drought]], to as much as {{convert|2956.2|mm|in|2}} between March 1990 and February 1991. On average, the driest year in ten can expect only half the mean rainfall, compared to around 64 percent in Brisbane, 68 percent in Sydney, and 72 percent in Darwin.

Rainfall also varies considerably within the metropolitan area; it typically ranges from {{convert|1136|mm|in}} at central [[Townsville City, Queensland|Townsville City]] to {{convert|853|mm|in}} at [[Woodstock, Queensland|Woodstock]], a southwestern suburb. The wettest 24 hours on record was 11 January 1998, with {{convert|548.8|mm|in}} falling mostly in a 12-hour period after dark, which has since been dubbed the "Night of Noah" by Townsville residents.<ref>{{cite web|last=Parkes|first=Kevin|title=Submission to Queensland Floods Commission of Enquiry|url=http://www.floodcommission.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/file/0018/1809/Parkes_Kevin.pdf|publisher=[[Queensland Government]]|access-date=8 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326132215/http://www.floodcommission.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/file/0018/1809/Parkes_Kevin.pdf|archive-date=26 March 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Tropical cyclones and flooding====
Like most of Northern Australia, Townsville is susceptible to [[tropical cyclone]]s. They usually occur between December and April, forming mainly out in the Coral Sea, and usually tracking west to the coast. Notable cyclones to affect the Townsville Region have been: [[Cyclone Kirrily]] (2024), [[Cyclone Yasi]] (2011), [[Cyclone Tessi]] (2000), [[Tropical Cyclone Sid (1997)|Cyclone Sid]] (1998, in particular damaging [[The Strand, Townsville|The Strand]] and causing [[1998 Townsville floods|major flooding]]), [[Cyclone Joy]] (1990), [[Cyclone Althea]] (1971), [[Cyclone Leonta]] (1903), and [[Cyclone Sigma]] (1896). The city was also affected by the [[2019 Townsville flood]], the convergence of a monsoon and a slow-moving tropical low.

==Governance==
Townsville has offices of many State and Federal Government agencies, such as [[Centrelink]] and the [[Australian Taxation Office]].
