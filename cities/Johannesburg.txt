A separate city from the late 1970s until 1994, [[Soweto]] is now part of the Greater Johannesburg metropolitan area. An acronym for "South-Western Townships", [[Soweto]] was organised initially as a collection of nondescript settlements on the outskirts of the city, populated mostly by African labourers working in the gold mining industry. [[Soweto]], although eventually incorporated into Johannesburg, had been explicitly separated as a residential area for blacks only—no whites allowed—who were not permitted to live in other "white-designated" areas of Johannesburg. Another region, [[Lenasia]], is predominantly populated by English-speaking Indo-South Africans (people of [[Indian people|Indian]] and [[South Asian]] descent). These areas were, in previous decades, designated as non-white areas, in accordance with [[apartheid]] policies of the time.

Johannesburg was one of the host cities of the official tournament of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] including the [[2010 FIFA World Cup Final|final]].

The [[metropolis]] is an [[global city|alpha global city]], as listed by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]].

== Etymology ==
Controversy surrounds the origin of the name. There were quite a number of people with the name "Johannes" who were involved in the early history of the city. Among them is the principal clerk attached to the office of the surveyor-general Hendrik Dercksen, [[Christiaan Johannes Joubert]], who was a member of the [[Volksraad of the South African Republic|Volksraad]] and was the Republic's chief of mining. Another was Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger (better known as [[Paul Kruger]]), president of the [[South African Republic]] (ZAR) from 1883 to 1900. [[Jan Meyer|Johannes Meyer]], the first government official in the area is another possibility.<ref name="Jo01">{{cite web |title=How was Johannesburg named? |url=https://www.joburg.org.za/play_/Pages/Play%20in%20Joburg/Culture%20and%20Heritage/Links/How-was-Johannesburg-named.aspx |website=www.joburg.org.za |language=en-ZA |access-date=30 April 2020 |archive-date=8 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308184520/https://www.joburg.org.za/play_/Pages/Play%20in%20Joburg/Culture%20and%20Heritage/Links/How-was-Johannesburg-named.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref>

Precise records for the choice of name were lost. Johannes Rissik and Johannes Joubert were members of a delegation sent to [[England]] to obtain mining rights for the area. Joubert had a park in the city named after him, and Rissik has his name for one of the main streets in the city where the historically important albeit dilapidated [[Rissik Street Post Office]] is located.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rissik Street Post Office Johannesburg – The Heritage Portal |url=http://www.theheritageportal.co.za/thread/rissik-street-post-office-johannesburg |website=www.theheritageportal.co.za |access-date=31 May 2017 |archive-date=18 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191018195115/http://www.theheritageportal.co.za/thread/rissik-street-post-office-johannesburg |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=295:rissik-street-post-office&catid=38:heritage&Itemid=51 |title=City of Johannesburg – Rissik Street Post Office |access-date=16 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111105718/http://joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=295:rissik-street-post-office&catid=38:heritage&Itemid=51 |archive-date=11 November 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[Johannesburg City Hall|City Hall]] is also located on Rissik Street.

==History==
{{main|History of Johannesburg|Timeline of Johannesburg}}
The region surrounding Johannesburg was originally inhabited by [[San people|San]] hunter-gatherers who used stone tools. There is evidence that they lived there up to ten centuries ago.<ref>{{cite web |title=Melville Koppies: Ancient History |url=http://mk.org.za/mkhist1.htm |website=mk.org.za |access-date=20 July 2021 |archive-date=15 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315061153/http://www.mk.org.za/mkhist1.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Stone-walled ruins of Sotho–Tswana towns and villages are scattered around the parts of the former [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] in which Johannesburg is situated.<ref>{{citation |last=Mason |first=Revil |title=Origins of Black People of Johannesburg and the Southern Western Central Transvaal, AD 300-1880 |number=Occasional Paper No. 16 |publisher=Archeological Research Unit (University of the Witwatersrand) |date=1986}}</ref>

By the mid-18th century, the broader region was largely settled by various [[Sotho–Tswana]] communities (one linguistic branch of Bantu-speakers), whose villages, towns, chiefdoms and kingdoms stretched from the [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]] (what is now [[Botswana]]) in the west,<ref>{{cite news |title=Botswana profile |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13041658 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=9 August 2012 |access-date=17 December 2020 |archive-date=11 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210211052647/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13041658 |url-status=live }}</ref> to present day [[Lesotho]] in the south,<ref>{{cite book |title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire |editor-first1=James S. |editor-last1=Olson |editor-first2=Robert S. |editor-last2=Shadle |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=1996 |page=118 |isbn=0-313-27917-9}}</ref> to the present day [[Northern Sotho language|Pedi]] areas of the [[Limpopo|Limpopo Province]]. More specifically, the stone-walled ruins of [[Sotho–Tswana]] towns and villages are scattered around the parts of the former Transvaal province in which Johannesburg is situated.

Many Sotho–Tswana towns and villages in the areas around Johannesburg were destroyed and their people driven away during the wars emanating from [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] during the late 18th and early 19th centuries (the [[mfecane]] or difaqane wars),<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mfecane {{!}} Zulu Expansion, Shaka Zulu & Nguni Migrations {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Mfecane |access-date=2024-04-24 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> and as a result, an offshoot of the Zulu kingdom, the [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]] (often referred to as the Matabele, the name given them by the local Sotho–Tswana), set up a kingdom to the northwest of Johannesburg around modern-day Rustenburg.

The main Witwatersrand gold reef was discovered in June 1884 on the farm Vogelstruisfontein by [[Jan Gerritse Bantjes (son)|Jan Gerritse Bantjes]], son of [[Jan Bantjes]], this triggered the [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush]] and the founding of Johannesburg in 1886. The discovery of gold rapidly attracted people to the area, making necessary a name and governmental organisation for the area. Jan, Johan and Johannes were common male names among the Dutch of that time; two men involved in surveying the area for the best location of the city, Christian Johannes Joubert and Johann Rissik, are considered the source of the name by some.

In 1884, they purchased the first pure refined gold from Bantjes for £3,000.

On 3 October 1886 the name Johannesburg was first used.

Gold was earlier discovered some {{convert|400|km|0|abbr=off}} to the east of present-day Johannesburg in [[Barberton, South Africa|Barberton]]. [[Prospecting|Gold prospectors]] soon discovered the richer gold reefs of the [[Witwatersrand]] offered by Bantjes. The original miners' camp, under the informal leadership of Col [[Ignatius Ferreira]], was located in the Fordsburg dip, possibly because water was available there, and because of the site's proximity to the diggings. Following the establishment of Johannesburg, the area was taken over by the Transvaal government who had it surveyed and named it Ferreira's Township, today the suburb of [[Ferreirasdorp]]. The first settlement at Ferreira's Camp was established as a tented camp and which soon reached a population of 3,000 by 1887.<ref name="ReidLane2004">{{cite book |author1=Andrew M.

Like many late 19th-century mining towns, Johannesburg was a rough and disorganised place, populated by white miners from all continents, African tribesmen were recruited to perform unskilled mine work, African women beer brewers cooked for and sold beer to the black migrant workers, a very large number of European prostitutes, gangsters, impoverished Afrikaners, tradesmen, and the "[[Laundry#South Africa|AmaWasha]]", Zulu men who surprisingly dominated laundry work.<ref>{{cite book |first=Charles |last=van Onselen |title=New Nineveh and New Babylon}}</ref> As the value of control of the land increased, tensions developed between the [[Boer]]–dominated Transvaal government in Pretoria and the British, culminating in the [[Jameson Raid]] that ended in fiasco at [[Doornkop]] in January 1896. The [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902) saw British forces under Field Marshal Frederick Sleigh Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts, occupy the city on 30 May 1900 after a series of battles to the south-west of its then-limits, near present-day Krugersdorp.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Fighting took place at the Gatsrand Pass (near Zakariyya Park) on 27 May, north of Vanwyksrust—today's Nancefield, [[Eldorado Park, Gauteng|Eldorado Park]] and Naturena—the next day, culminating in a mass infantry attack on what is now the waterworks ridge in Chiawelo and Senaoane on 29 May.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_remository&Itemid=401&func=select&id=5 |title=Battle for Johannesburg |access-date=17 April 2015 |archive-date=23 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923231101/http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_remository&Itemid=401&func=select&id=5 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/ebooks/0%202009may27%20Two%20Battles%20for%20Johannesburg%20_final%20draft_.pdf |title=Hidden in Plain Sight: Johannesburg's Battlefields |author=Engelbrecht, Leon |date=27 May 2009 |access-date=17 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417133321/http://www.defenceweb.co.za/ebooks/0%202009may27%20Two%20Battles%20for%20Johannesburg%20_final%20draft_.pdf |archive-date=17 April 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

During the Boer war, many African mineworkers left Johannesburg creating a labour shortage, which the mines ameliorated by bringing in labourers from China, especially southern China. After the war, they were replaced by black workers, but many Chinese stayed on, creating Johannesburg's Chinese community, which during the apartheid era, was not legally classified as "Asian", but as "Coloured". The population in 1904 was 155,642, of whom 83,363 were [[White people|whites]].<ref name="EB1911">{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Johannesburg |volume=19 |page=432}}</ref>

In 1917, Johannesburg became the headquarters of the [[Anglo American plc|Anglo-American Corporation]] founded by [[Ernest Oppenheimer]] which ultimately became one of the world's largest corporations, dominating both gold-mining and diamond-mining in South Africa. Major building developments took place in the 1930s, after South Africa went off the gold standard.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}<ref>{{Cite news |last=Writer |first=Staff |date=13 August 2017 |title=These pictures show what Joburg looked like in 1930 |url=https://businesstech.co.za/news/lifestyle/191454/these-pictures-show-what-joburg-looked-like-in-1930/ |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240524112252/https://businesstech.co.za/news/lifestyle/191454/these-pictures-show-what-joburg-looked-like-in-1930/ |archive-date=24 May 2024 |access-date=24 May 2024 |work=BusinessTech }}</ref> In the late 1940s and early 1950s, [[Hillbrow]] went high-rise. In the 1950s and early 1960s, the apartheid government constructed the massive agglomeration of townships that became known as [[Soweto]].

The system of [[apartheid]], a comprehensive system of racial separation was imposed upon South Africa starting in 1948. For its growth, the economy of Johannesburg depended upon hundreds of thousands of skilled white workers imported from Europe and semi- and un-skilled black workers imported from other parts of Southern Africa. Though they worked together they were forced by the government to live separately. Work was considered to be an exception to apartheid in order to keep Johannesburg functioning as South Africa's economic capital.<ref name="Brogan, Patrick page 86">Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 86.</ref>

In the 1950s, the government began a policy of building townships for black families (prior to this unskilled workers were asked to work on "single status" in male-only hostels at the mines and had to commute to see their families in whatever province they originated) outside of Johannesburg to provide workers for Johannesburg.<ref name="Brogan, Patrick page 86"/> [[Soweto]], a township founded for black workers coming to work in the gold mines of Johannesburg, was intended to house 50,000 people, but soon was the home of ten times that number as thousands of unemployed rural blacks came to Johannesburg for employment and an income to send back to their villages.<ref name="Brogan, Patrick page 92">Brogan, Patrick ''The fighting never stopped: a comprehensive guide to world conflicts since 1945'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 page 92.</ref> It was estimated that in 1989, the population of Soweto was equal to that of Johannesburg, if not greater.<ref name="Brogan, Patrick page 92"/>

The central area of the city underwent something of a decline in the 1980s and 1990s, due to the high crime rate and when property speculators directed large amounts of capital into suburban shopping malls, decentralised office parks, and entertainment centres.

[[File:Soccer City Stadium, Johannesburg, South Africa (4690804881).jpg|thumb|[[Satellite image]] of Johannesburg]]
[[File:JohannesburgGP-Aerial.jpg|thumb|January 2008 Johannesburg aerial view looking towards the south-east]]
Johannesburg is located in the eastern plateau area of [[South Africa]] known as the [[Highveld]], at an elevation of {{convert|1753|m|ft}}. The former [[Central Business District]] is located on the southern side of the prominent ridge called the [[Witwatersrand]] (English: White Water's Ridge) and the terrain falls to the north and south. By and large the Witwatersrand marks the watershed between the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] and [[Vaal River|Vaal]] rivers as the northern part of the city is drained by the [[Jukskei River]] while the southern part of the city, including most of the Central Business District, is drained by the [[Klip River]]. The north and west of the city has undulating hills while the eastern parts are flatter.

Johannesburg may not be built on a river or harbour, but its streams contribute to two of southern Africa's mightiest rivers, the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] and the [[Orange River|Orange]]. Most of the springs from which many of these streams emanate are now covered in concrete and canalised, accounting for the fact that the names of early farms in the area often end with "fontein", meaning "spring" in Afrikaans. Braamfontein, Rietfontein, Zevenfontein, Doornfontein, Zandfontein and Randjesfontein are some examples. When the first white settlers reached the area that is now Johannesburg, they noticed the glistening rocks on the ridges, running with trickles of water, fed by the streams—giving the area its name, the Witwatersrand, "the ridge of white waters". Another explanation is that the whiteness comes from the quartzite rock, which has a particular sheen to it after rain.<ref>Lucille Davie ''Water, water every day'' www.joburg.org.za, 24 December 2004.</ref>

The site was not chosen for its streams, however. The main reasons the city was founded where it stands today was because of the gold. Indeed, the city once sat near massive amounts of gold, given that at one point the Witwatersrand gold industry produced forty per cent of the planet's gold.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Johannesburg-South-Africa |title=Johannesburg |last=Campbell |first=James T. |date=19 August 2015 |website=Britannica.com |access-date=8 November 2016 |archive-date=9 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109090744/https://www.britannica.com/place/Johannesburg-South-Africa |url-status=live }}</ref>

Mining was the foundation of the [[Witwatersrand]]'s economy, but its importance is gradually declining due to dwindling reserves and service and manufacturing industries have become more significant to the city's economy. While gold mining no longer takes place within the [[city limits]], most mining companies still have their headquarters in Johannesburg. The city's manufacturing industries extend across a range of areas and there is still a reliance on heavy industries including steel and cement plants. The service and other industries include banking, IT, real estate, transport, broadcast and print media, private health care, transport and a vibrant leisure and consumer retail market.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Johannesburg has Africa's largest stock exchange, the [[JSE Limited|JSE]] although it has moved out of the central business district. Due to its commercial role, the city is the seat of the provincial government and the site of a number of government branch offices, as well as consular offices and other institutions.

The Witwatersrand urban complex is a major consumer of water in a dry region. Its continued economic and population growth has depended on schemes to divert water from other regions of South Africa and from the highlands of [[Lesotho]], the biggest of which is the [[Lesotho Highlands Water Project]], but additional sources will be needed early in the 21st century.

The container terminal at [[City Deep, Gauteng|City Deep]] is known to be the largest "[[dry port]]" in the world,<ref>{{cite journal | title=The Role of Dry Ports in South Africa | last1=Cronje | first1=Erené | last2=Matthee | first2=Marianne | last3=Krugell | first3=Waldo | journal=Transport and Communications Bulletin for Asia and the Pacific | issue=78 | year=2009 | pages=112–120 | publisher=[[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific|ESCAP]] | s2cid=55915534 | url=https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/d8files/bulletin78_Article-7.pdf | access-date=2024-09-08}}</ref> with some 50% of cargo that arrives through the ports of [[Durban]] and [[Cape Town]] arriving in Johannesburg.

Johannesburg's largest shopping centres, measured by gross leasable area (GLA, the uniform measure of centre size as determined by the International Council of Shopping Centers) are Sandton City, Eastgate, Mall of Africa, Westgate and Cresta. [[Melrose Arch]] is one of its most prestigious.{{citation_needed|date=October 2012}} Other centres include [[Hyde Park Corner (shopping centre)|Hyde Park Corner]], [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank]], [[Southgate Shopping Centre|Southgate]], The Glen Shopping Centre, Johannesburg South, and Clearwater Mall. There were also plans to build a large shopping centre, known as the Zonk'Izizwe Shopping Resort, in [[Midrand]], but these have been indefinitely delayed due to the opening of [[Mall of Africa]]. "Zonk'Izizwe" means "All Nations" in [[Zulu language]], indicating that the centre will cater to the city's diverse mix of peoples and races. Also a complex named Greenstone in Modderfontein has been opened.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://architectafrica.com/bin0/features-GreenstoneMall-Bentel-05.html |title=GREENSTONE MALL : BENTEL INTERNATIONAL: Architect Africa Features Page |publisher=Architectafrica.com |access-date=2 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051208015832/http://www.architectafrica.com/bin0/features-GreenstoneMall-Bentel-05.html |archive-date=8 December 2005 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Cradlestone Mall is a new mall named for its location which is close to the [[Cradle of Humankind]], a World Heritage Site.

After the [[Group Areas Act]] was scrapped in 1991, Johannesburg was affected by [[urban blight]]. Thousands of poor black people, who had been forbidden to live in the city proper, moved into the city from surrounding black townships like [[Soweto]] and many immigrants from economically beleaguered and war torn African nations flooded into South Africa. Many buildings were abandoned by [[landlord]]s, especially in high-density areas, such as [[Hillbrow]]. Many corporations and institutions, including the [[JSE Securities Exchange|stock exchange]], moved their headquarters away from the city centre, to suburbs like [[Sandton]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Johannesburg Stock Exchange History - Property24.com |url=http://www.property24.com/articles/johannesburg-stock-exchange-history/16977 |website=www.property24.com |access-date=18 February 2016 |archive-date=24 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224180746/https://www.property24.com/articles/johannesburg-stock-exchange-history/16977 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Reviving the city centre is one of the main aims of the municipal government of Johannesburg. Drastic measures have been taken to reduce crime in the city. These measures include [[closed-circuit television]] on street corners.

=== Public art ===
Public art ranges from sculptures to murals to pieces by artists like [[William Kentridge]] and [[Gerhard Marx]]'s [[Fire Walker]]. Many pieces are developed through community workshops, such as the Vilakazi Street sculptures. Others are functional, such as street furniture found in [[Hillbrow]] and the city centre.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

As part of the Johannesburg Development Agency's (JDA) policy to make city areas desirable to potential investors, the organisation has identified public art as a way to improve the urban experience of the city.<ref>{{cite web |title=JDA's PUBLIC ART STRATEGY 2011–2016 |url=http://www.jda.org.za/docs/publi_art_strategy.pdf |website=www.jda.org.za |publisher=Johannesburg Development Agency |access-date=31 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401054603/http://www.jda.org.za/docs/publi_art_strategy.pdf |archive-date=1 April 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The JDA spends 1 percent of all projects of over R10-million on public art.<ref>{{cite web |title=Place making and public art |url=http://www.jda.org.za/index.php/whatwedo/programmes/inner-city |website=www.jda.org.za |publisher=Johannesburg Development Agency |access-date=31 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331210050/http://www.jda.org.za/index.php/whatwedo/programmes/inner-city |archive-date=31 March 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Architecture and urbanism ===
{{Main|Architecture of Johannesburg|Suburbs of Johannesburg}}
[[File:Trust Bank Building.jpg|thumb|[[Trust Bank Building]] in 2018]]
[[File:Joburg skyline.jpg|thumb|Johannesburg Central Business District]]
Johannesburg is home to some of Africa's tallest structures, such as the [[Sentech Tower]], [[Hillbrow Tower]], the [[Carlton Centre]] and [[Ponte City Apartments]]. The Johannesburg city skyline has most of the tallest buildings on the continent and contains most international organisations such as [[IBM]], [[Absa Group|Absa]], [[BHP]], [[Willis Group]], [[First National Bank (South Africa)|First National Bank]], [[Nedbank]] and [[Standard Bank]]. Many of the city's older buildings have been demolished and more modern ones built in their place. North of the CBD is [[Hillbrow]], the most densely populated residential area in southern Africa. Northwest of the CBD is [[Braamfontein]], a secondary CBD housing many offices and business premises. The CBD is predominated by four styles of architecture, being [[Colonial architecture|Victorian Colonial]], [[Edwardian Baroque]], [[Art Deco]] and [[Modernism]].

The city is often described as Africa's economic powerhouse, and contentiously as a modern and prosperous African city.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news |last=Smith |first=David |title=Johannesburg rebuked over 'world-class city' advert |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/johannesburg-world-class-city-advert |access-date=15 July 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 July 2013 |archive-date=4 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904072916/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/johannesburg-world-class-city-advert |url-status=live }}</ref> Johannesburg, like many metropolises, has more than one central business district (CBD), including, but not limited to, Sandton, Rosebank and Roodepoort in addition to the original CBD. Some tend to include Benoni and Germiston as well.

Due to its many different central districts, Johannesburg would fall under the [[multiple nuclei model]] in [[human geography]] terms. It is the hub of South Africa's commercial, financial, industrial, and mining undertakings. Johannesburg is part of a larger urban region. It is closely linked with several other satellite towns. [[Randburg]] and [[Sandton]] form part of the northern area. The east and west ridges spread out from central Johannesburg. The Central Business District covers an area of {{convert|6|km2|0|abbr=out}}. It consists of closely packed skyscrapers such as the [[Carlton Centre]], [[Marble Towers]], [[Trust Bank Building]], [[Ponte City Apartments]], [[Southern Life Centre]] and [[11 Diagonal Street]].

Johannesburg's city centre retains its elements of a rectangular grid pattern that was first officially recorded in 1886.<ref name=":0"/> Streets are narrow and filled with high rises built in the mid- to late 1900s. Old Victorian–era buildings first built in the late 1800s have been torn down long ago.<ref name=":0"/> The 1900s brought along with it the introduction of many different architectural styles and structures. The Johannesburg Art Gallery and Supreme Court Building being two examples. These were important Beaux-Arts structures, with the style put in place by (at the time) colonial parent, the British Empire.<ref name=":0"/> South Africa didn't borrow architectural techniques exclusively from Britain, however. They were also inspired by American models and styles, having built several structures like the ESKOM Building and the Corner House to emulate the prowess of New York City, located in the United States.<ref name=":0"/>

=== Sports ===
[[File:FIFA World Cup 2010 Uruguay Ghana.jpg|thumb|[[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] vs. [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] at the [[FNB Stadium]], during the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]]]

Johannesburg's most popular sports by participation are [[association football]], [[cricket]], [[rugby union]], and [[running]]. Early each Sunday morning, tens of thousands of runners gather to take part in informal runs organised by several athletic clubs.

The city has several football clubs in the [[Premier Soccer League]] (PSL) and the [[National First Division]]. In the PSL, the top Johannesburg teams are all fierce rivals and include [[Kaizer Chiefs F.C.|Kaizer Chiefs]] (nicknamed ''Amakhosi''), [[Orlando Pirates F.C.|Orlando Pirates]] (nicknamed the ''Buccaneers''), [[Moroka Swallows F.C.|Moroka Swallows]] and [[Wits University F.C.|Wits University]] (nicknamed the ''Clever Boys''). They are based at the city's [[FNB Stadium|FNB]], [[Orlando Stadium|Orlando]], [[Dobsonville Stadium|Dobsonville]] and [[Bidvest Stadium|Bidvest]] stadiums. Several large-scale league and cup games are played at [[Soccer City]] the venue of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] final. First Division teams are [[Jomo Cosmos]] and [[FC AK]]. Katlehong City and Alexandra United, play at [[Alexandra Stadium|Alexandra]] and Reiger Park stadium respectively.

Cricket is one of the more popular sports. In cricket, the [[Highveld Lions]] represent Johannesburg, the rest of Gauteng as well as the [[North West Province|North West]] at the [[Wanderers Stadium]] which was the venue for the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]] Final in which [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] successfully defended their title against [[India national cricket team|India]]. Wanderers Stadium hosted what many cricket fans consider the greatest ever [[One Day International cricket|ODI]] match in which South Africa successfully chased down 434 runs. They take part in the [[first-class cricket|first class]] [[SuperSport Series]], the [[limited overs cricket|one-day]] [[MTN Domestic Championship]] and the [[Twenty20]] [[Ram Slam T20 Challenge]]. Johannesburg also hosted matches from and the final of the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20]], in which India beat [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] in the final.

The [[Lions (United Rugby Championship)|Lions]], formerly the Cats, represent Johannesburg, [[North West (South African province)|North West]] and [[Mpumalanga]] in the [[United Rugby Championship]] competition, which includes teams from South Africa, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. The [[Golden Lions]] compete in the [[Currie Cup]], which they have won on ten occasions. They are housed at [[Ellis Park Stadium]], which also hosted the [[World Rugby|IRB]] [[1995 Rugby World Cup Final]], in which the South African [[Springboks]] defeated the New Zealand [[All Blacks]].

The city's [[Ticketpro Dome]] and the [[Ellis Park Arena]] hosted two of the three [[NBA Africa Game (disambiguation)|NBA Africa Game]]s.<ref>{{cite news |title=Getting to know Africa's flashy basketball arenas |url=https://www.fiba.basketball/news/getting-to-know-africas-flashy-basketball-arenas |access-date=10 December 2020 |work=[[FIBA]] |date=2 September 2019 |archive-date=7 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210107193242/https://www.fiba.basketball/news/getting-to-know-africas-flashy-basketball-arenas |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Infrastructure ==
=== Transportation ===
Johannesburg is a young and sprawling city, with its public transportation built in its infancy, geared towards private motorists, and lacks a convenient public transportation system. The City though has invested a large percentage of its budget{{When|date=March 2024}} toward an effective integrated public transportation system. A significant number of the city's residents are dependent on the city's informal minibus taxis.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==== Roads ====
{{Further information|Johannesburg Freeways}}[[File:Johannesburg,_Gauteng,_South_Africa_(2417711025).jpg|thumb|The [[M1 (Johannesburg)|M1]] is a major freeway in Johannesburg]]
Johannesburg shares a network of [[Metropolitan Routes in Johannesburg|metropolitan routes]] with [[Krugersdorp]] and [[Ekurhuleni]]. The fact that Johannesburg is not near a large navigable body of water has meant that ground transportation has been the most important method of transporting people and goods in and out of the city. One of Africa's most famous "beltways" or ring roads/orbitals is the [[Johannesburg Ring Road]]. The road is composed of three freeways that converge on the city, forming an {{convert|80|km|adj=on}} loop around it: the [[N3 Eastern Bypass (South Africa)|N3 Eastern Bypass]], the [[N1 Western Bypass (South Africa)|N1 Western Bypass]] and the [[N12 Southern Bypass (South Africa)|N12 Southern Bypass]]. The [[N3 road (South Africa)|N3]] was built exclusively with [[Asphalt concrete|asphalt]], while the [[N12 (South Africa)|N12]] and [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1]] sections were made with concrete, hence the nickname given to the N1 Western Bypass, "The Concrete Highway". In spite of being up to 12 lanes wide in some areas, the Johannesburg Ring Road is frequently clogged with traffic. The Gillooly's Interchange (renamed George Bizos Interchange in 2021<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-10-13 |title=Here are the streets affected by Ekurhuleni's new name changes |url=https://www.citizen.co.za/news/south-africa/government/2740326/city-of-ekurhuleni-street-name-changes-13-october-2021/ |access-date=2022-01-02 |website=The Citizen |language=en}}</ref>), built on an old farm and the point at which the N3 Eastern Bypass and the [[R24 (Gauteng)|R24 Airport Freeway]] intersect, is the busiest interchange in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref name=sanral>{{cite web |title=Busiest freeways in southern hemisphere |url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/busiest-freeways-in-southern-hemisphere-2008-09-26 |publisher=SA National Roads Agency |date=26 September 2008 |access-date=15 July 2013 |archive-date=16 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616164747/http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/busiest-freeways-in-southern-hemisphere-2008-09-26 |url-status=live }}</ref> It is claimed<ref name=sanral/><ref>{{cite news |last=Staff Reporter |title=18 perish in road accidents |url=http://www.newsday.co.zw/2013/05/10/18-perish-in-road-accidents |access-date=15 July 2013 |newspaper=NewsDay |date=10 May 2013 |archive-date=19 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719181822/http://www.newsday.co.zw/2013/05/10/18-perish-in-road-accidents/ |url-status=live }}</ref> that the N1 is the busiest road in South Africa.

==== Bus and taxi transit ====
[[Image:Rea Vaya stop in CBD.JPG|thumb|[[Rea Vaya]] bus stop in [[Johannesburg CBD]] in Commissioner Street at Ntemi Piliso Street]]
Johannesburg is served by a bus fleet operated by MetroBus, a corporate unit of the City of Johannesburg.<ref>{{cite web |title=Metrobus |url=http://www.mbus.co.za/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050211061241/http://www.mbus.co.za/ |archive-date=11 Feb 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=About Us |url=https://mbus.joburg.org.za/about-us |website=City of Johannesburg |publisher=Metrobus |access-date=19 September 2023 |archive-date=3 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231003225238/https://mbus.joburg.org.za/about-us |url-status=dead }}</ref> It has a fleet consisting of approximately 550 single and double-decker buses, plying 84 different routes in the city. This total includes 200 modern buses (150 double-deckers and 50 single-deckers), made by [[Volvo]], [[Scania AB]] and Marcopolo/Brasa in 2002. Metrobus' fleet carries approximately 20 million passengers per annum. In addition, there are a number of private bus operators, though most focus on the inter-city routes, or on bus charters for touring groups. The city's main bus terminus is situated in [[Gandhi Square]], where passengers can also obtain information regarding the Metrobus service from the walk-in customer information desk.

In 2010, in order to create an efficient public transport system the [[Rea Vaya]] bus rapid system was developed/built. The buses run on their own dedicated bus lanes on the main trunk and complementary routes. The buses also have large feeder routes that run on ordinary roads. The Rea Vaya works on a smartcard payment system, on entering the station or bus the passenger taps his/her smartcard onto the validator/scanner and taps out at the next station with the calculated amount. The routes cover both the southern and northern suburbs with the main trunk route running from Soweto to Sandton and Rosebank, and the feeder and complementary routes covering most of Johannesburg, with the notable exceptions of Midrand and Centurion. A subsequent expansion (phase 1-C;1-D) will cover these areas. In 2017, the [[Rea Vaya]] bus rapid transit was recorded to be making huge losses recovering only about 40 per cent of the operating costs and relying heavily on government subsidies.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.fin24.com/Economy/bus-rapid-transit-bleeding-cash-20170226-2 |title=Bus Rapid Transit bleeding cash |work=Fin24 |access-date=2 July 2019 |archive-date=2 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702073721/https://www.fin24.com/Economy/bus-rapid-transit-bleeding-cash-20170226-2 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Johannesburg has two kinds of taxis, [[taxicab|metered taxis]] and [[Minibus taxi#Minibus taxi|minibus taxis]]. Unlike many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city looking for passengers and instead must be called and ordered to a destination. The Gauteng Provincial Government has launched a new metered taxi programme in an attempt to increase the use of metered taxis in the city.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The minibus "taxis" are the ''de facto'' standard and essential form of transport for the majority of the population. Since the 1980s, the minibus taxi industry has been severely affected by [[Taxi wars in South Africa|turf wars]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://yoinsta.com/tag/knysna |title=Posts filled under #knysna |last=YoInsta |website=yoinsta.com |access-date=28 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228112329/https://yoinsta.com/tag/knysna |archive-date=28 December 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Greef |first=Kimon de |date=2018-07-22 |title=In South Africa's 'Mafia-Like' Taxi Industry, 11 Die in Latest Attack |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/22/world/africa/south-africa-taxi-attack.html |access-date=2022-03-09 |issn=0362-4331 |archive-date=13 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230513083505/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/22/world/africa/south-africa-taxi-attack.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Airports ====
[[Image:Ekurhuleni_Aerotropolis.jpg|thumb|[[O. R. Tambo International Airport]]]]
Johannesburg is served principally by [[O. R. Tambo International Airport]] (formerly Johannesburg International Airport and before that Jan Smuts Airport) for both domestic and international flights. [[Lanseria Airport]], located to the north-west of the city and closer to the business hub of [[Sandton]], is used for commercial flights to [[Cape Town]], [[Durban]], [[Port Elizabeth]], Botswana, and [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]]. Other airports include [[Rand Airport]] and [[Grand Central Airport]].

==== Rail ====
[[Image:South Africa-Metrorail-001.jpg|thumb|[[Metrorail Gauteng]] at [[Braamfontein]], Johannesburg]]
The [[Metrorail Gauteng]] [[commuter rail]] system connects central Johannesburg to [[Soweto]], [[Pretoria]], and most of the satellite towns along the [[Witwatersrand]]. The railways transport huge numbers of commuters every day. However, the Metrorail infrastructure was built in Johannesburg's infancy and covers only the older areas in the city's south. The northern areas, including the business districts of [[Sandton, Gauteng|Sandton]], [[Midrand, Gauteng|Midrand]], [[Randburg, Gauteng|Randburg]], and [[Rosebank, Gauteng|Rosebank]], are served by the rapid [[railway|rail]] link [[Gautrain]].

[[File:Gautrain..., O R Tambo Intl Airport South Africa.jpg|thumb|[[Gautrain]] station at OR Tambo Airport]]
A part of the Gauteng Provincial Government's Blue IQ Project, [[Gautrain]] has made provision for a rapid [[railway|rail]] link, running north to south, between Johannesburg and Pretoria, and west to east between Sandton and the [[OR Tambo International Airport]]. Construction of the Gautrain Rapid Rail started in October 2006 and was completed in June 2012. It consists of a number of underground stations, as well as above-ground stations. Stations on the north–south line include Johannesburg's [[Johannesburg Park Station|Park Station]] (underground), [[Rosebank (Gautrain station)|Rosebank]] (underground), [[Sandton (Gautrain station)|Sandton]] (underground), [[Marlboro (Gautrain station)|Marlboro]] (above-ground and raised), [[Midrand (Gautrain station)|Midrand]], [[Pretoria railway station|Pretoria]] Station and [[Hatfield (Gautrain station)|Hatfield]]. There is also a line from the O.R. Tambo International Airport (above-ground and raised) travelling to Sandton via [[Rhodesfield (Gautrain station)|Rhodesfield]] (raised) and Marlboro. A 200-kilometre expansion is underway and will consist of 3 new lines and 18 new stations, and is expected to cost R18 billion and one-lines (Soweto Mamalodi) could take 4 years to build, most of the new stations will be in Johannesburg.

The east–west line from the airport to Sandton opened in June 2010 in time for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], while the north–south line opened on 2 August 2011, except for Park Station, which opened in 2012.

The rail system was designed to alleviate traffic on the [[N1 (South Africa)|N1]] freeway between Johannesburg and Pretoria, which records vehicle loads of up to 300,000 per week day.<ref>{{cite web |title=Why Rapid Rail |url=http://www.gautrain.co.za/about/about-gautrain/why-rapid-rail/ |publisher=Gautrain |access-date=24 August 2017 |archive-date=25 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825063354/http://www.gautrain.co.za/about/about-gautrain/why-rapid-rail/ |url-status=live }}</ref> An extensive bus feeder system has also been implemented, which allows access to the main stations from the outer suburbs, but is limited to a five-kilometre radius, which neglects the rest of the suburbs. This is the first new major railway system that has been laid in South Africa since 1977.<ref>{{cite web |title=Railway country. 150 Years of Rail in South Africa |url=http://www.transnetfreightrail-tfr.net/Heritage/150years/150YearsRail.pdf |publisher=Transnet |access-date=24 August 2017 |archive-date=12 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012074755/http://www.transnetfreightrail-tfr.net/Heritage/150years/150YearsRail.pdf |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2010, a [[Johannesburg-Durban High Speed Rail|high-speed rail link]] was proposed between Johannesburg and [[Durban]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/ambitious-plans-will-still-need-funding/browse/3.html |access-date=19 September 2010 |title=Railway Gazette: Ambitious plans will still need funding |archive-date=15 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615134927/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/ambitious-plans-will-still-need-funding/browse/3.html |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2020 the government announced plans for high-speed rail from Johannesburg to [[Soweto]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=25 October 2020 |title=South Africa's Rail Expansion Plan Links Soweto to Johannesburg |language=en |work=Bloomberg.com |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-25/south-africa-s-rail-expansion-plan-links-soweto-to-johannesburg |access-date=25 October 2020 |archive-date=28 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201028213615/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-25/south-africa-s-rail-expansion-plan-links-soweto-to-johannesburg |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Freight ====
City Deep Terminal is the name of Africa's largest [[dry port]] and was officially opened by the South African Railways Services (SARS) in 1977. The container terminal is connected to the Port of Durban, Port of Ngqurha, Port of Cape Town, as well as Southern Africa by road and rail. At least forty percent of container export/imports run on the Natal Corridor (Natcor) which is directly linked by rail to City Deep.
