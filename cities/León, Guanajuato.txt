León has a large [[leather]] industry, making shoes, boots, belts, jackets, and other leather accessories for national and international markets. The leather industry earned its inhabitants the nickname of "green belly" (''panzaverde'' in Spanish) because of the green tainting in the workers' bodies resulting from [[tanning (leather)|treating leather]]. Its first-class services and hotel industry make it an important commercial center in Mexico with numerous options for entertainment, gastronomy, leisure activities, arts, and recreation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocvleon.com/?mod=visitors |title=Leon Excitement City • Leon Guanajuato Mexico |publisher=Ocvleon.com |access-date=2012-01-08}}</ref> It is also considered one of the most [[environmentally friendly]] cities in Mexico and has a high number of cyclists, in part because of integrating a network of [[bike lanes]] into the SIT system.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url=http://www.itdp.org/index.php/news/detail/sustainable_transport_award_cities_leon |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611145131/http://www.itdp.org/index.php/news/detail/sustainable_transport_award_cities_leon/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-06-11 |title=Institute for Transportation and Development Policy : News : Sustainable Transport Award cities: León |publisher=ITDP |date=2011-01-18 |access-date=2012-01-08 }}</ref> In March 2012, it received an award as "City Water Champion", mainly due to great progress in the areas of sanitation, wastewater reuse, and energy cogeneration from [[biogas]].<ref>[https://archive.today/20120702214905/http://www.sapal.gob.mx/comunicadosprensa/1357-reconocen-a-leon-como-una-de-las-urbes-con-mayores-avances-en-el-tratamiento-y-reuso-del-agua-residual-y-cogeneracion-de-energias-6o-foro-mundial-del-agua Reconocen a León como una de las urbes con mayores avances en el tratamiento y reuso del agua residual y cogeneración de energías: 6º.

== History ==
{{see also|Timeline of León, Mexico}}
[[File:LeonPlaza2.jpg|thumb|Madero street]]

=== Mesoamerica ===
In the León area there are ten distinct archeological zones, dating from the pre-classic [[Mesoamerica]]n period.<ref name="EncMuc">{{cite web|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/guanajuato/index.html |title=Enciclopedia de los municipios Guanajuato Leon |language=es |access-date=2008-10-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202043032/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/guanajuato/index.html |archive-date=2008-12-02 }}</ref> Most of these are identified with the [[Chupícuaro]] culture.<ref name="historia">{{cite web |url=http://www.ruelsa.com/gto/leon/leon4.htm |title= Leon Guanajuato Historia |language=es |access-date=2008-10-18 }}</ref> By the Classic period, the area was under [[Teotihuacan]] and [[Toltec]] influence. In the 13th century, the [[Chichimeca]]s, mostly of the [[Guamare]] and [[Guachichil]] subgroups, overran the area, migrating from an area of what is now [[San Luis Potosí]]. They remained through the Colonial period.<ref name="EncMuc"/><ref name="historia"/>

=== Colonial period ===
In 1530, [[Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán]] arrived with allied [[Purépecha people|Tarasco]] Indians to the area, naming it [[Nuestra Señora]].<ref name="EncMuc"/> Homesteads were granted by the governor of [[Nueva Galicia]] [[Francisco Vásquez de Coronado]] to Spaniards Rodrigo de Vázquez and Juan de Jasso.<ref name="historia"/> Farming and cattle-raising were introduced here around 1546 by the Spaniards, but these settlers were under constant threat by the Chichimecas, who recognized the Spanish as invaders. These settlers requested assistance from the viceregal authorities in [[Mexico City]].<ref name="EncMuc"/><ref name="historia"/>

As a response, [[viceroy]] [[Martín Enríquez de Almanza]] ordered the founding of a city here, with the name of León in 1575. To carry out the order, Juan Bautista de Orozco founded the village of León on 20 January 1576, creating its first town council and laying out its initial streets. In 1580, it attained the rank of "alcadía mayor" meaning it has governing authority of much of the land and smaller towns surrounding it from the Sierra de Comanja to the [[Lerma River]].<ref name="EncMuc"/><ref name="historia"/> For example, two other towns founded in the area were San Miguel and Coecillo. In San Miguel, the Spaniards settled the [[Otomi people]]s and in Coecillo were settled the [[Purépecha people|Purépechas]], [[Mexica]]s and the Chichimecas that did not oppose Spanish rule. As the population of the area grew, a number of municipalities would eventually break off, such as San Francisco del Rincón, Purísima del Rincón (Purísima Concepción), Cd. Manuel Doblado (San Pedro Piedra Gorda), Huanímaro, Abasolo, Cuerámaro and Pénjamo.<ref name="historia"/>

=== Jesuit reformer ===
In 1582, the first hospital of San Cosme y San Damián was established by Father Espino.<ref name="historia"/> The [[Jesuit]]s arrived to León in 1731, founding the "Compañía Vieja" which is now the site of the Temple of the Immaculate. They also constructed the Temple of the New Company, which would become the cathedral, however they never finished it as they were expelled from Mexico in 1767. On 2 July 1732 arrived an image of Our Most Holy Mother of Light. She would later be declared the patron saint of the city, in 1849.<ref name="historia"/>
[[File:Aérea de la Plaza Principal - panoramio - Trëxo.jpg|thumb|185px|left|Main plaza]]
The population of the area suffered epidemics in 1643, droughts in 1630 and 1712–1714, famines in 1714 and 1786, and flooding in 1637, 1749, 1762, and 1803.<ref name="historia"/>

=== Mexican civil war ===
Independence forces under José Rafael de Iriarte arrived to the town on 4 October 1810. However, two months later royalist forces under [[Felix Calleja]] retook the locality, with insurrectionist sympathizers facing reprisals.<ref name="EncMuc"/> About 2,000 insurgents on horses attacked the town but were repulsed by Count Pérez Gálvez.<ref name="historia"/> Royalist forces were attacked here in 1817 by [[Francisco Javier Mina]] without success. The town remained in royalist hands until the end of the [[Mexican War of Independence]], when [[Agustín de Iturbide]] arrived.<ref name="EncMuc"/> The town did not celebrate its first [[Grito de Dolores]] to mark independence until 1825. In 1827 it became one of the four "departments" of the newly created state of Guanajuato, and in 1830, it gained city status.<ref name="historia"/> In 1840, Father Ignacio Aguado founded the College of San Francisco de Sales and the College of La Madre Santísima was founded in 1844.<ref name="historia"/>

=== La Reforma ===
During [[La Reforma]] war, the city changed hands various times between Liberal and Conservative forces between 1858 and 1860. The most notable battle of that war here was when General José Iniesta attacked the town on 18 February 1859. In that same year, León even separated for a time from the rest of the state of Guanajuato.<ref name="historia"/>

In 1862, the bishopric of León was founded, separating the city of León and nine other municipalities such as [[Irapuato]], [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]] and [[Dolores Hidalgo]] from the bishopric of [[Michoacán]]. Bishop Diez de Sollano opened the Conciliar Seminary in 1864. This bishop consecrated the Basilica Cathedral in 1866, even though it was not completed, giving the image of the Virgin of the Light a permanent home.<ref name="historia"/>

=== French occupation ===
From 1863 to 1866, the French occupied León during the [[Second French intervention in Mexico|French Intervention]], with [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Emperor Maximillian]] visiting the city in 1864. His arrival was much celebrated here, with fireworks and a [[hot air balloon]] exhibition put on by the Alemán brothers. However, when Liberal forces finally had permanent control over the town, two incidents occurred. On 30 September 1867, Coronel Cecilio Delgado Estrada ordered his men to shoot over the heads of people who prayed in the streets, causing some to be wounded. Another incident of this type occurred in 1877. The second was more permanent. The Liberals decommissioned the convent and college of Saints Peter and Paul, converting it into offices for city government. It remains such to this day.<ref name="historia"/>

=== Contested elections ===
On 2 January 1946, a mob gathered in the plaza in front of the municipal palace to protest elections seen as illegitimate. These protesters were fired upon, killing many. This plaza has been named the "Plaza of the Martyrs" in their honor.<ref name="EncMuc"/>

=== Climate ===
{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2017}}
Leon generally has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system|Köppen]]: Cwa) with summer rainfall (according to [[Köppen climate classification]], Cwa) that closely borders on a [[semi-arid climate]]. The average annual temperature is  {{convert|19.9|C|F}}, the warmest month is May with a maximum average of {{convert|31.7|C|F}}, and the coolest month is January with a minimum average temperature of {{convert|7.7|C|F}}. Outside the city microclimate island, the ranges tend to be higher, with maximum averages reaching 2&nbsp;°C higher than in the city, and minimum averages lowered by 3&nbsp;°C or more. In the villages located in between the northern mountains the climate changes; it is considered [[subtropical highland climate]] (Cwb according to Köppen climate classification), the average annual temperature is around {{convert|16|C|F}}.

Leon averages {{convert|681|mm|in|abbr=on}} of precipitation annually, which mainly occurs during the summer and early autumn (from late May through October) generally with thunderstorms in the evening. There is usually a discrepancy about whether Leon's valley is either sub-humid or semi-arid. Depending on the methodology, it can be considered as being either one or the other. With Köppen's methodology, there needs to be more than {{convert|678|mm|in|0}} of annual precipitation for Leon to be considered as humid subtropical; according to several weather stations it may have both (humid subtropical and semiarid) terminologies applied to it. The years considered in the study may also be a determinant factor (more frequently used for international purposes is a 30-year data compilation). Years of average rainfall are rare; the usual pattern is bi-modal, with some large string of dry years usually related to La Niña phenomenon (slightly higher than {{convert|300|mm|in|0}}) followed by other years (around 5) related to El Niño that make up the average (with higher than {{convert|39|in|mm|abbr=off|disp=or}}). Snowfall is extremely rare. The latest snowfall recorded in Leon was in 1997, although there have been other years of registered slushy snow since 1997.

== Historic sites ==

=== Cathedral ===
[[File:ChurchLeonGTOPlaza.JPG|thumb|185x185px|Church of St. Sebastian at Mártires del 2 de Enero Square]]
The main church is called the [[Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of the Light, León|Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of the Light]] and is the seat of the Archdiocese of Leon. Construction of the church was begun in 1746 by the [[Jesuit]]s and is a combination of Baroque and Neo Classic architectural styles. Construction was halted only eight months after it began when the Jesuit order was expelled from Mexico by the Spanish Crown. The Obregon family, however, took over its construction, continuing into the 19th century. The Archdiocese of Leon was created in 1864, with its first bishop, José María de Jesús Diez de Sollano y Dávalos helping to get the towers and cupola completed as he chose the church as the seat. It was finally completed and consecrated on 16 March 1866. Pope [[Benedict XVI]] officiated a mass here in 2012.<ref name="catedral">{{cite web |url=http://www.leonguanajuato.com/catedral/ |title=Catedral Basicilia |access-date=2008-10-16 |language=es }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/worldnews/9167733/Pope-Benedict-XVI-visits-Mexico.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/worldnews/9167733/Pope-Benedict-XVI-visits-Mexico.html |archive-date=2022-01-12 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Benedict XVI visits Leon, Mexico}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

=== Expiatorio ===
[[File:Detalle de la fachada lateral del Templo Expiatorio de León, Gto., México 1.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Detail of the façade of the Templo Expiatorio]]
Its full name is the Santuario Expiatorio del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús (Expiatory Sanctuary of the Sacred Heart of Jesus). Construction of this shrine was begun in 1920 by Bernardo Chavez with the support of Bishop Emeterio Valverde y Téllez. It is [[neo-Gothic]] in design, based on the old European medieval cathedrals but much of the outside wallspace is without decoration. Its work was halted by the [[Cristero]] Wars. Since then construction has continued off and on and it is considered 90% complete. An important source of income for the shrine's construction is the sale of crypts. This practice was begun in 1924. A chapel dedicated to the [[Virgin of Lourdes]] was begun in 1935 and later a chapel dedicated to the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]], which is separate from the main building, built between 1935 and 1939. A shrine with [[stained glass]] windows includes local allegories.

=== Municipal Palace ===
[[File:León palacioMunicipalok.jpg|thumb|right|Municipal Palace]]
The current Municipal Palace is of the [[Ionic order]] and occupies part of the site of the old "Colegio Grande del Seminario de los Padres Paulinos" (Grand Seminary College for Pauline Priests) who had to abandon the city in 1860.<ref name="portal">{{cite web |url=http://www.leon.gob.mx/portal/modules/icontent/index.php?page=22 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20060518150216/http://www.leon.gob.mx/portal/modules/icontent/index.php?page=22 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2006-05-18 |title=Palacio Municipal |language= es |access-date=2008-10-17 }}</ref>

From 1861 to 1867 it was a military barracks. After the French Intervention, it was remodeled to conserve its original architecture by Coronel Octaviano Rosado to become the seat of government on 21 March 1869. The patio of the building contains (in 1972) a bronze statue of [[Benito Juárez]] to commemorate the centennial of his death. Since then, the building has had a number of additions such as the dome that now covers this patio, and a number of murals. These murals were painted in 1972 and 1973 by Jesus Gallardo covering the walls of the main stairwell and the hallway of the upper floor around the patio.<ref name="portal"/>

=== Millennium's Gate ===
The monument was built to celebrate the arrival of the new millennium and has become a landmark. The 45-meter tall tower on five [[plinth]]s was completed on time for [[New Year's Day]] 2000. The 5,400 square meter plaza is planted with trees. The project cost 4.5 million [[peso]]s.<ref name="portal2">{{cite web |url= http://www.leon.gob.mx/portal/modules/icontent/index.php?page=30 |archive-url= https://archive.today/20060518150047/http://www.leon.gob.mx/portal/modules/icontent/index.php?page=30 |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2006-05-18 |title= Puerta del Milenio |language=es |access-date=2008-10-17 }}</ref>

=== Arch of the Causeway of the Heroes (Arco de la Calzada de los Héroes) ===
[[File:Arco de la Calzada León.jpg|thumb|Causeway Arch's Heroes]]
This arch (Arco de la Calzada de los Héroes, in Spanish), topped by a bronze lion, began construction in 1896 and has been modified a number of times since then. The first lion was added in 1943 by Francisco Lozornio Castillo made of bricks and mortar. This was replaced by the bronze one in 1958. The idea for a bronze lion was that of the matador Antonio Velázquez, a native of Leon, whose bravery in the ring earned him the nickname of the "Heart of Leon" ("Corazón de León", in Spanish).<ref name="portal3">{{cite web |url= http://www.leon.gob.mx/portal/modules/icontent/index.php?page=26 |title= Una historia diferente |author= Rubén Rodríguez Molina |language= es |access-date= 2008-10-17 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081025184342/http://www.leon.gob.mx/portal/modules/icontent/index.php?page=26 |archive-date= 2008-10-25 }}</ref> Not long before his death in 1959, he complained that the brick lion should be replaced with a better work of art, causing something of a commotion in the Leon community. This caught the attention of sculptor Humberto Peraza Ojeda who made the one that sits atop the arch today.<ref name="portal3"/>

Leon is one of the most bicycle-friendly large cities in Latin America and has an extraordinary track record in active transport, keeping the biking and walking share above 39% of the total trips, one of the highest values in Latin American cities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itdp.org/index.php/sustainable_transport_award |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105203921/http://itdp.org/index.php/sustainable_transport_award |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-01-05 |title=Institute for Transportation and Development Policy : Get Involved : Sustainable Transport Award |publisher=ITDP |date=2011-01-24 |access-date=2012-01-08 }}</ref>

=== Integrated Transportation System ===
[[File:OptibusLeonMX.JPG|alt=Sistema Integrado de Transporte (SIT)|left|thumb|Transport's Integrated System]]
Integrated Transportation System (ITS) (Sistema Integrado de Transporte in Spanish) refers to the development and implementation of a [[Bus rapid transit]] system named "[[Sistema Integrado de Transporte Optibús|Optibús]]". Since 28 September 2003, the Integrated Transport Optibús has operated despite an existing need for a subway system "Metro", which originally was planned construction with two lines.

The system was the first of its kind in Mexico. Leon was the first city in the country with a BRT system, before it was implemented in [[Mexico City]] as Metrobús and [[Guadalajara]] as Macrobús.

Optibús System
The current route system is divided into four categories. These are:
* '''Trunk routes''': They consist of eight main lines that cross the city from end to end. The buses are also known as ''Orugas'' (caterpillars in Spanish) due to its articulated midsection. They have capacity for 175 passengers. The Optibús transit system consists of 52 stations located in the central area of the main avenues of the city.
* '''Feeder and auxiliary routes''': These are urban bus routes that were integrated into the regular system, as a stop as they have one or more transfer stations, and are identified by the letter A (feeder route / yellow decals) or X (auxiliary route / blue decals).
* '''Conventional routes''': These routes circulate through most of the city and are distinguished by having the corporative colors from its owners: orange, red, pink, purple, and green.
* '''Suburban roads''': Roads circulate outside or on the city edge communities as Comanjilla, Duarte, Loza de los Padres, La Hacienda, etc.

There are currently three permanent transfer stations (San Jeronimo, Delta de Jerez and San Juan Bosco), two micro-stations (Santa Rita - Parque Juarez), which are the endpoints for trunk routes, feeder routes and auxiliary routes. Passengers at these stations are allowed to transfer without cost from any of these lines.

In addition, as a control measure, the "PagoBús" system has been instituted; this is an electronic card system that allows users to streamline their access to stations and bus and thus save money. There are 2 types of cards: Preferential and General, cost rates with 50 and 15% lower total cost.

The environmental benefits of the system are also high, not least because the system introduced articulated buses using Euro IV technology and ultra low sulfur, resulting in 5,600 tons of {{CO2|link=yes}} reduction annually.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

===Public transportation statistics===
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in León, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 78 min. 21% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 20 min, while 40% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 5.1&nbsp;km, while 2% travel for over 12&nbsp;km in a single direction.<ref>{{cite web|title=León Public Transportation Statistics|publisher=Global Public Transit Index by Moovit|url=https://moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_M%C3%A9xico_Leon-3321|access-date=June 19, 2017}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016050101/https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ |date=2017-10-16 }}.</ref>
