'''Posadas''' ({{IPA|es|poˈsaðas}}) is the capital city of the [[Provinces of Argentina|Argentine province]] of [[Misiones Province|Misiones]], in its south, at the far north-west of the country on the left bank of the [[Paraná River]], opposite [[Encarnación, Paraguay]]. The city has an area of {{convert|965|km2}} and a population of 324,756 ({{census-ar|2010}}), and the Greater Posadas area has a population of over 359,609 according to a 2017 estimate.<ref>{{cite web |title=IPEC |date=26 April 2018|url=https://ipecmisiones.org/dato-estadistico/poblacion-del-aglomerado-posadas-4-trimestre-de-2017/}}</ref>

Posadas is the provincial centre of the government, culture and the economy. Furniture, tobacco, food, textiles and construction are its most important industries. Other important economic activities are commerce and services.

Posadas is connected to the Paraguayan city of Encarnación by the [[San Roque González de Santa Cruz Bridge]]. The port, once of great economical importance, is used for sport vessels, carrier of passengers and some boats for sand transport. The city is located on [[National Route 12 (Argentina)|National Route 12]], some {{convert|1300|km}} from [[Buenos Aires]]. The [[General José de San Martín Airport]] {{airport codes|PSS|SARP}}, at coordinates {{coord|27|22|S|55|58|W|}}, is seven kilometres from the city, and features regular flights to Buenos Aires.

==History==
Father [[Roque González y de Santa Cruz]] established a town called Anunciación de Itapúa on 25 March 1615, but ten years later the settlement was moved to the other side of the [[Paraná River]] to the present location of [[Encarnación, Paraguay]].

The first settlement was not completely abandoned, and a new San José reduction was settled there in 1628. In 1867, during the [[Paraguayan War]], the Brazilians set up the Trinchera de San José military base there. Following the end of the war, Paraguay renounced all claims to the area, and in 1879, the town was renamed after [[Gervasio Antonio de Posadas]], the Supreme Director of the [[Argentine Confederation]] (1814).

On 22 December 1881, the limits of the Misiones Federation were drawn, leaving Posadas within the territory of current [[Corrientes Province]]. On 30 July 1884 the [[Argentine National Congress|National Congress]] decided to give Posadas to Misiones Province, and name it its capital. The [[National University of Misiones]] was established at Posadas in 1973, and in 1990, the city's cultural and economic links to Encarnación were strengthened with the completion of the [[San Roque González de Santa Cruz Bridge]].

==Public transportation==
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Posadas, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 57 min. 10% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 16 min, while 26% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.3&nbsp;km, while 2% travel for over 12&nbsp;km in a single direction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Posadas Public Transportation Statistics|publisher= Global Public Transit Index by Moovit|url=https://moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_Argentina_Posadas-3865|access-date=19 June 2017}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].</ref>
