The lake drains into the Brahmaputra, {{cvt|5|km}} to the north, and acts as a natural stormwater reservoir for the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guwahationline.in/city-guide/geography-of-guwahati|title=Geography of Guwahati|publisher=Guwahati Online Portal|access-date=15 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017113955/http://www.guwahationline.in/city-guide/geography-of-guwahati|archive-date=17 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.maharashtraweb.com/Assam/Cities/Guwahati/geographyofguwahati.asp| title=Geographical Profile of Guwahati| publisher=Maharashtra Web Portal| access-date=15 September 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070118000337/http://www.maharashtraweb.com/Assam/Cities/Guwahati/geographyofguwahati.asp| archive-date=18 January 2007| url-status=live}}</ref> There are also multiple hills within the city limits.

=== Urban morphology ===
[[File:Guwahati urban morphology.svg|thumb|Guwahati's urban morphology|alt=]]

Guwahati's 'urban form' radiates from a central core with growth corridors radiating and extending towards the south, east, and west. In the past few decades, southern Guwahati areas such as Ganeshguri, Beltola, Hatigaon, Six Mile, and Panjabari began forming a southern sub-center surrounding the capital complex at Dispur. The core area<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assamtribune.com/jul1109/horizon.html |title=Assam Tribune online |publisher=Assamtribune.com |author=TI Trade |access-date=12 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222213058/http://www.assamtribune.com/jul1109/horizon.html |archive-date=22 February 2011 }}</ref> consists of the old city with [[Pan Bazaar]], [[Paltan Bazaar]], [[Fancy Bazaar]] and [[Uzan Bazaar]], with each area facilitating unique urban activities.<ref name="Capital of Assam" /><ref name="Guwahati's Urban Morphology">{{cite web|url=https://online.assam.gov.in/web/guest/urban|title=Guwahati's Urban Morphology|publisher=Assam Online Portal|access-date=31 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001020943/https://online.assam.gov.in/web/guest/urban|archive-date=1 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Among the city corridors, the most important is the corridor formed along the Guwahati-Shillong (GS) Road towards the south (almost {{cvt|15|km|disp=sqbr}} from the city-center). The GS Road corridor is an important commercial area with retail, wholesale and commercial offices developed along the main road; it is also a densely built residential area in the inner parts. The capital complex of Assam at [[Dispur]] is situated in this corridor. This corridor has facilitated the growth of a southern city sub-center at Ganeshguri, along with other residential areas to the south developed during the past few decades.<ref name="Capital of Assam" /><ref name="Guwahati's Urban Morphology" />

The corridor extending towards the west (around {{cvt|30|km|disp=sqbr}} from the city center) contains a rail-road linking not only Guwahati but also other parts of the northeastern region east of Guwahati to western Assam and the rest of India. The corridor links residential and historically important areas such as Nilachal Hill (Kamakhya), Pandu, and Maligaon (headquarters of Northeast Frontier Railways) before it separates into two – one towards North Guwahati via the [[Saraighat]] Bridge and the other continuing west towards LGB International Airport via [[Gauhati University]] (Jalukbari). There are also many river ports/jetties along this corridor.<ref name="Capital of Assam" /><ref name="Guwahati's Urban Morphology" />

The third major corridor extends towards the east (around {{convert|15|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} from the city-center) linking Noonmati ([[Guwahati Refinery]]) and Narengi, and has facilitated residential growth along with it. Highway NH-37, which encircles the city's southern parts and links the southern corridor in Noumile to the western corridor in Jalukbari is currently supporting rapid development. Similarly, the VIP Road linking Zoo Road with the eastern corridor and recently completed Hengerabari-Narengi Road are also supporting massive residential development to the east.<ref name="Capital of Assam" /><ref name="Guwahati's Urban Morphology" />

==Administration and governance==
[[File:View of Guwahati city from atop Nilachal hill.jpg|thumb|Guwahati city]]
Dispur, the capital of Assam, lies in Guwahati. The passing of the North Eastern (Reorganization Areas) Act in 1971 by the [[Indian Parliament]] accorded [[Meghalaya]] the status of a full-fledged state. After the creation of Meghalaya as a separate state, Shillong continued to be the joint capital of both Assam and Meghalaya. However, in 1972, the Government of Assam decided to shift the capital to Dispur. Accordingly, the first sitting of the Budget Session of the Assam Legislative Assembly was held at Dispur on 16 March 1973.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://assamassembly.gov.in/history.html| title=Assam Legislative Assembly - History| publisher=assamassembly.gov.in| access-date=10 November 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919195931/http://www.assamassembly.gov.in/history.html| archive-date=19 September 2015| url-status=live}}</ref> Dispur houses the Secretariat of Assam Government, the Assam Assembly House, the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) Regional Office, the North Eastern Development Finance Corporation Ltd (NEDFi) House and the Guwahati Tea Auction Centre (GTAC).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/assam/dispur-city-map.html |title=Dispur Map |publisher=Maps of India |access-date=16 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912054518/http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/assam/dispur-city-map.html |archive-date=12 September 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Judiciary===
[[File:Vikramjit-Kakati-HC.jpg|thumb|The [[Gauhati High Court]]]]
Guwahati is the principal seat of the [[Gauhati High Court]]. It acts as the High Court of Assam and also of [[Nagaland]], [[Mizoram]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] with their outlying benches of [[Kohima]], [[Aizawl]] and [[Itanagar]], respectively. Gauhati High Court came in effect from 5 April 1948.

===Problems===
==== Increase in population ====
In recent years, Guwahati has experienced rapid population growth due to migration for education and employment opportunities. This population increase has led to undesirable expansion of the city and has resulted in various collateral problems, such as the rise in the number of slums.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Kangkan Kalita|date=Feb 13, 2018 |title=Forced migration causing an increase in Guwahati slums   |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/forced-migration-causing-increase-in-guwahati-slums/articleshow/62897203.cms |access-date=2022-12-27 |website=The Times of India |language=en}}</ref><ref name="Problems of Guwahati">{{cite web|url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/detailsnew.asp?id=dec2610/city07|title=Problems of Guwahati|publisher=assamtribune.com|date=6 March 2015|access-date=2 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203041245/http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/detailsnew.asp?id=dec2610%2Fcity07|archive-date=3 February 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> It is projected that the population of Guwahati will reach 1.5 million by 2035, up from an estimated 1.1 million in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://populationstat.com/india/gauhati|title = Gauhati, India Population (2021) - Population Stat}}</ref>

==== Inflation ====
One of the economic problems that the citizens of Guwahati have to put up with is the hike in prices of many essentials, chiefly vegetables, poultry, and fish. The prices of these commodities keep escalating at an inordinate rate because of which the buyers find it difficult to buy these items. Vegetables are transported into Assam from [[West Bengal]], [[Bihar]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Delhi]], [[Maharashtra]] and [[Meghalaya]] and the truckers en route have to pay considerable amount of money as tax at various check posts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/detailsnew.asp?id=apr2814/city05 |title=Increasing prices of potato causing concern |publisher=The Assam Tribune |date=28 April 2014 |access-date=21 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923175632/http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/detailsnew.asp?id=apr2814%2Fcity05 |archive-date=23 September 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/mdetails.asp?id=may0613/city06 |title=Govt yet to initiate action to check price rise |publisher=The Assam Tribune |date=6 May 2013 |access-date=21 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923200247/http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/mdetails.asp?id=may0613%2Fcity06 |archive-date=23 September 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> It is one of the causes of rise in prices of vegetables in the markets of Guwahati. The prices of locally available vegetables and fruits undergo large [[Markup (business)|markup]] because of transportation expenses grounds, besides intra-State check posts taxes. In addition to these, the wholesale dealers, as well as the retail sellers, augment the prices of the commodities according to their own desires.

The price of poultry, mainly chicken, that reaches the city markets from places like [[Chaygaon]] and [[Barpeta district|Barpeta]] have been soaring rapidly because of similar factors. There has been steep rise in the price of fish as well, the prominent varieties of which being Rohu ("Rou"), Catla ("Bahu"), Walking catfish ("Magur") and Monopterus ("Kuchia") among many others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/detailsnew.asp?id=jun3013/city05 |title=Abnormal rise in prices of foodstuff hits citizens |publisher=The Assam Tribune |date=30 June 2013 |access-date=21 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923200125/http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/detailsnew.asp?id=jun3013%2Fcity05 |archive-date=23 September 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/Rise-in-chicken-fish-prices-affects-locals/articleshow/20852487.cms|title=Rise in chicken, fish prices affects locals |work=The Times of India|date=1 July 2013 |access-date=21 August 2015}}</ref>

==== Flooding ====
According to experts, urban flooding in Guwahati in the near future is expected to worsen to the point where residents of certain areas may be forced to relocate. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the alteration of drainage channels and wetlands due to rapid urbanization has exacerbated the problem of flooding.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |author=Mukut Das|date=Apr 10, 2021 |title='Guwahati floods will worsen, force people to abandon city'   |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/guwahati-floods-will-worsen-force-people-to-abandon-city/articleshow/82003356.cms |access-date=2022-12-27 |website=The Times of India |language=en}}</ref>

Professor Abani Kumar Bhagawati of Gauhati University stated that since before there were sufficient wetlands to absorb rainwater and channels to carry excess water to the Brahmaputra, the city did not experience floods. However, human interference has disrupted the natural topography, leading to the current situation where "just half an hour of rain" can cause flooding in the city. Encroachment and concretization, which reduce open areas for natural water absorption, are the primary causes of floods according to Bhagawati.<ref name=":0" />

==== Pollution ====
Guwahati was ranked the second most polluted city in the world in a 2023 report published by IQAir, behind [[Begusarai]] and ahead of [[Delhi]], reflecting India's status as the country with the third highest level of pollution after Bangladesh and Pakistan.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2024-03-20 |title=‘Guwahati 2nd most polluted city in world last yr’ |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/guwahati-pollution-report-2nd-most-polluted-city-in-the-world-last-year/articleshow/108631089.cms |access-date=2024-10-17 |work=The Times of India |issn=0971-8257}}</ref>
