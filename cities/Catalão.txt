==History and the Festival of Congadas==
[[Image:Congada de Catalão.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Festival of Congadas in Catalão]]

Catalão began to be occupied around 1722 or 1723 when one of the [[bandeirantes]], [[Bartolomeu Bueno da Silva]] planted crops for his supply.

The settlement began around 1728, with the construction of a few huts to support the troops who were penetrating this region.  Near Catalão, one of the chaplains of the force, Frei Antônio, a native of [[Catalonia]] and called "o Catalão" decided to start a rest point near a small stream.

By 1828, the settlement had five houses with tile roofs and twenty grass covered huts.

In  1859, Catalão became a legally constituted city. Today the municipality has an area of 3,789&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>,. corresponding to 1.1% of the state territory

The story of the {{Audio||'''Congadas'''}}, Catalão's popular festival began in 1820, when semi-free slaves arrived in the Vila of Catalão to work in the coffee plantations.  The slaves brought with them their customs, one of which was the cult of [[Our Lady of the Rosary]].  Her commemoration included a mixture of Afro and Catholic rites.  Now these dances, with strong influences from the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Congo]] and [[Mozambique|Moçambique]], are celebrated in Catalão in the largest festival of Congadas in Brazil.

The festival takes place on the last Friday of September and lasts until the second Sunday of October, when the dancers go  to the streets in their colorful costumes, filling the city streets with their songs, which give thanks to their patroness for the blessings given.
