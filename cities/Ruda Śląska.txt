It is a city in the [[Metropolis GZM]], a metropolis with a population of two million. It is in the [[Silesian Highlands]], on the [[Kłodnica]] [[River]] (tributary of the [[Oder River|Oder]]).

It has been part of the [[Silesian Voivodeship]] since its formation in 1999. Previously, it was in [[Katowice Voivodeship]], and before then, part of the [[Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship]].

==History==
[[File:Slask - Nowy Bytom - Huta Pokoj ante 1939 (61781315).jpg|thumb|left|Pokój ironworks in the interbellum]]
A large village is known to have existed at the location of the present day city center in 1243. The city name appears to indicate the awareness and perhaps exploitation of ores from early times.

The area underwent rapid industrialization (coal, steel, [[zinc]]) in the 19th and the beginning of 20th century. However, it remained a cluster of industrial settlements and villages until the 1950s, when it was administratively united. However, it never developed into a truly unified city.

Before the German [[invasion of Poland]] and the outbreak of [[World War II]], in 1939, German saboteurs carried out an attack in Ruda.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wardzyńska|first=Maria|year=2009|title=Był rok 1939. Operacja niemieckiej policji bezpieczeństwa w Polsce. Intelligenzaktion|language=pl|location=Warszawa|publisher=[[Institute of National Remembrance|IPN]]|page=24}}</ref> Following the invasion, the area was under [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|German occupation]] from 1939 to 1945. Several Polish teachers from present-day Ruda Śląska were murdered by the Germans in [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] as part of the ''[[Intelligenzaktion]]''.<ref>Wardzyńska, pp. 140, 142</ref> The Germans also established and operated a ''[[Polenlager]]'' [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]] camp for Poles in the present-day district of [[Kochłowice, Ruda Śląska|Kochłowice]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.2&tab=7&id=100000734|title=Polenlager Ruda-Kochlowitz|website=Bundesarchiv.de|accessdate=9 May 2021|language=de}}</ref> and the E83 forced labour subcamp of the [[Stalag VIII-B|Stalag VIII-B/344]] [[German prisoner-of-war camps in World War II|prisoner-of-war camp]] in the present-day district of [[Chebzie]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lamsdorf.com/working-parties.html|title=Working Parties|website=Lamsdorf.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201029103834/https://www.lamsdorf.com/working-parties.html|accessdate=9 May 2021|archive-date=29 October 2020}}</ref> The [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance movement]] was active in the area. In 1945, the German occupation ended, and the area was restored to Poland, although with a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-installed communist regime, which then stayed in power until the [[fall of communism]] in the 1980s.

After the fall of communism in 1989, the significant heavy industry was largely scaled down or restructured. The area has been transforming to a service-based economy. The well-known still operating coal mine is "Halemba".

Since 2007, Ruda Śląska has been a member of the Upper Silesian Metropolitan Union (predecessor to the [[Metropolis GZM]]), the largest legally recognized urban area in Poland.

==Transport and infrastructure==

Significant roadways are [[Autostrada A4 (Poland)|Highway A4]] and the [[Drogowa Trasa Średnicowa]]. There are several small railway stations, mainly on the line Katowice-Gliwice.

Since 1950, Ruda Śląska is the site of a transmission facility, which was used from 1950 to 1988 for medium-wave radio broadcasting.
