== History ==
=== Early settlement ===
[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-40-54.jpg|Aerial view of Tamale and police [[barracks]] in 1929|thumb|left|200px]]
The area of Tamale used to consist of small villages, which were under the [[kingdom of Dagbon]]. it was a popular destination of cattle trails in the region.<ref name="history2"/>{{rp|1}} In 1907, the [[British Empire|British]] decided to establish administrative headquarters in the area with help from the [[Tamale Dakpema|Dakpema]] after German officials have taken over [[Yendi]]. With the addition of a road in 1920, nicknamed the 'Great North Road', Tamale turned into an important center of business in the [[Northern Territories of the Gold Coast|Northern Territories]].<ref name="history1">{{cite web|url=https://scholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl/access/item%3A2958827/view|title=Tamale 1907-1957 : between colonial trade and colonial chieftainship|date=8 May 2012|publisher=Universiteit Leiden|access-date=15 June 2024}}</ref><ref name="history2"/>{{rp|2}}

Throughout the 20th century, the population of Tamale was growing rapidly of people looking for abundant water supply and electricity. This have resulted in massive amounts of land used for infrastructure, threatening residents ability to farm. During this time, a series of disputes between the Gulkpe Na{{efn|The Gulkpe naa is one of the seven district chiefs in [[kingdom of Dagbon|Dagbon]]; in rank directly under the Paramount Chief, he overlooks the local chiefs in and around Tamale}} and the Dakpema for power in Tamale occurred. This is in part due to the British incorporated [[indirect rule]] in the town, resulting in the imbalance of power between the chiefs. Although local councils were introduced and indirect rule was discontinued, tension between the chiefs continues even to this day.<ref name="history2"/>

In 1960, Tamale became the capital of the Northern Region after the region had separated from the rest of the north.<ref name="history2"/>{{rp|15}}
