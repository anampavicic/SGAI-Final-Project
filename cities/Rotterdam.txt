It is in the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[South Holland]], part of the [[North Sea]] mouth of the [[Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta]], via the [[Nieuwe Maas|''"New Meuse"'']] inland shipping channel, dug to connect to the [[Meuse]] at first and now to the [[Rhine]].

Rotterdam's history goes back to 1270, when a [[dam]] was constructed in the [[Rotte (river)|Rotte]]. In 1340, Rotterdam was granted city rights by [[William II, Count of Hainaut|William IV, Count of Holland]]. The [[Rotterdam–The Hague metropolitan area]], with a population of approximately 2.7&nbsp;million, is the [[List of urban areas in the European Union|10th-largest in the European Union]] and the most populous in the country.

A major logistic and economic centre, Rotterdam is [[Port of Rotterdam|Europe's largest seaport]]. In 2022, Rotterdam had a population of 655,468 and is home to over 180 different nationalities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/37230ned/table?ts=1578685738191 |title=Bevolkingsontwikkeling; regio per maand |language=Dutch |website=[[Statistics Netherlands|CBS StatLine]] |access-date=23 July 2021 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190725200732/https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/37230ned/table?ts=1578685738191 |archive-date=25 July 2019}}<br />8,219,380 Randstad<br />2,620,000 Rotterdam-The Hague Metro<br />1,160,000 Rotterdam Urban<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;651,446 Rotterdam Municipality</ref> 

Rotterdam is known for its [[Erasmus University Rotterdam|university]], riverside setting, lively cultural life, maritime heritage and modern [[#Architecture|architecture]]. The near-complete destruction of the city centre during the [[World War II]] [[German bombing of Rotterdam|German bombing]] has resulted in a varied architectural landscape, including [[skyscraper]]s designed by architects such as [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Piet Blom]] and [[Ben van Berkel]].<ref>{{cite web |date=9 March 2015 |title=Top 10 Cities : The Rough Guide to 2014 |url=http://www.roughguides.com/best-places/2014/top-10-cities/#/rotterdam/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322080718/http://www.roughguides.com/best-places/2014/top-10-cities/#/rotterdam/ |archive-date=22 March 2015 |access-date=9 March 2015 |publisher=Rough Guides}}</ref><ref name="Academy of Urbanism">{{cite web |date=14 November 2014 |title=Urbanism Awards: Rotterdam takes top prize |url=http://www.academyofurbanism.org.uk/urbanism-awards-rotterdam-takes-top-prize/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222180405/http://www.academyofurbanism.org.uk/urbanism-awards-rotterdam-takes-top-prize/ |archive-date=22 December 2014 |access-date=15 December 2014 |publisher=Academy of Urbanism}}</ref><ref>New York Times.

The [[Rhine]], [[Meuse]] and [[Scheldt]] give waterway access into the heart of Western Europe, including the highly industrialized [[Ruhr]]. The extensive distribution system including rail, roads, and waterways have earned Rotterdam the nicknames "Gateway to Europe" and "Gateway to the World".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Jan Walburg |title=The port of Rotterdam: Gateway to Europe |date=1 August 1984}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Royal van Gorcum |title=Dutch Culture in a European Perspective: 1950, prosperity and welfare |date=1999 |quote="Rotterdam port: Gateway to Europe" (p.151)}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=21 February 2014 |title=Gateway to the world: how EU helped Rotterdam to become Europe's largest port {{!}} News {{!}} European Parliament |language=en |work=europarl.europa.eu |url=https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/eu-affairs/20140221STO36622/gateway-to-the-world-how-eu-helped-rotterdam-to-become-europe-s-largest-port |url-status=live |access-date=12 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190816090319/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/eu-affairs/20140221STO36622/gateway-to-the-world-how-eu-helped-rotterdam-to-become-europe-s-largest-port |archive-date=16 August 2019}}</ref>

The settlement at the lower end of the [[fen]] stream ''[[Rotte (river)|Rotte]]'' (or ''Rotta'', as it was then known, from ''rot'', "muddy" and ''a'', "water", thus "muddy water") dates from at least the year 950.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Vredenbregt |first1=A.H.L. |last2=Van Trierum |first2=M.

A dam on the Rotte was built in the 1260s and was located at the present-day ''Hoogstraat'' ("High Street").

On 7 July 1340, Count [[William II, Count of Hainaut|Willem IV of Holland]] granted [[City rights in the Low Countries|city rights]] to Rotterdam, which then had a population of only a few thousand.<ref>{{cite web |date=9 March 2015 |title=Geschiedenis van Rotterdam |url=http://www.rotterdam.nl/tekst:bescheiden_begin |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305123510/https://www.rotterdam.nl/tekst:bescheiden_begin |archive-date=5 March 2016 |publisher=Gemeente Rotterdam}}</ref> Around the year 1350, a shipping canal (the ''[[Schie|Rotterdamse Schie]]'') was completed, which provided Rotterdam access to the larger towns in the north, allowing it to become a local trans-shipment centre between the Netherlands, [[England]] and [[Germany]], and to [[Urbanization|urbanize]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Rotterdam - City, Port, History, & Facts |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Rotterdam-Netherlands |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310035028/https://www.britannica.com/place/Rotterdam-Netherlands |archive-date=10 March 2018 |access-date=1 March 2018 |website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref>

Beginning in the 1600's, Rotterdam was involved in the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. According to historian Gerhard de Kok, "Rotterdam merchants were the pioneers of the [[History of Dutch slavery|Dutch slave trade]]". From the 17th century until 1814, when the [[Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands|United Netherlands]] abolished the Netherland's involvement in the slave trade at the request of the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]], Dutch [[slave ship]]s from Rotterdam sailed to [[Africa]] and the [[Americas]] as part of the [[triangular trade]]. Rotterdam merchants also sold significant quantities of [[gunpowder]] to [[Zeeland]]-based slave ships.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.erasmusmagazine.nl/en/2020/08/27/why-the-netherlands-slavery-past-is-rotterdams-past-too/ | title=How Rotterdam, too, was involved in the slave trade | date=27 August 2020 }}</ref>

The port of Rotterdam grew slowly but steadily into a port of importance, becoming the seat of one of the six "chambers" of the ''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie'' (VOC), the [[Dutch East India Company]] and one of the five "chambers" of the '' West-Indische Compagnie'' (WIC), the [[Dutch West India Company]].

The greatest spurt of growth, both in port activity and population, followed the completion of the [[Nieuwe Waterweg]] in 1872. The city and harbour started to expand on the south bank of the river. The ''[[Witte Huis]]'' or ''White House'' skyscraper,<ref>{{cite web |title=The ''Witte Huis'' or ''White House'' |url=http://glasssteelandstone.com/BuildingDetail/229.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041220211137/http://glasssteelandstone.com/BuildingDetail/229.php |archive-date=20 December 2004 |url-status=usurped |access-date=15 May 2008}}</ref> inspired by American office buildings and built in 1898 in the French [[Art Nouveau|Art Nouveau style]], is evidence of Rotterdam's rapid growth and success. When completed, it was the tallest office building in Europe, with a height of {{cvt|45|m|2}}.

During [[World War I]], the city was the world's largest spy centre because of Dutch neutrality and its strategic location between Britain, Germany and German-occupied Belgium. Many spies who were arrested and executed in Britain were led by German secret agents operating from Rotterdam. [[MI6]] had its main European office on de Boompjes. From there the British coordinated espionage in Germany and occupied Belgium. During World War I, an average of 25,000 Belgian refugees lived in the city, as well as hundreds of German deserters and escaped Allied prisoners of war.<ref>Ruis, Edwin. ''Spynest. British and German Espionage from Neutral Holland 1914–1918''. Brimscombe: The History Press, 2016.</ref>

During [[World War II]], the German army [[German invasion of the Netherlands|invaded the Netherlands]] on 10 May 1940.<ref>{{harvnb|Evans|2008|pp=122–3}}.</ref> [[Adolf Hitler]] had hoped to conquer the country in just one day, but his forces met unexpectedly fierce resistance. The Dutch army was forced to capitulate on 15 May 1940, following the [[Rotterdam Blitz|bombing of Rotterdam]] on 14 May and the threat of bombing other Dutch cities.<ref>{{harvnb|Brongers|2004|loc=(ONR Part III), p. 235}}</ref>{{sfn|Amersfoort|2005|p=369}}{{sfn|Götzel|1980|pp=149, 150}}<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Helen Hill Miller |title=Rotterdam - Reborn from Ruins |journal=[[National Geographic]] |date=October 1960 |volume=118 |issue=4 |pages=526–553}}</ref> The heart of Rotterdam was almost completely destroyed by the [[Luftwaffe]]. Some 80,000 civilians were made homeless and 900 were killed; a relatively low number since many had fled the city because of the warfare and bombing going on in Rotterdam since the start of the invasion three days earlier. The City Hall survived the bombing. [[Ossip Zadkine]] later attempted to capture the event with his statue ''[[De Verwoeste Stad]]'' ('The Destroyed City'). The statue stands near the Leuvehaven, not far from the [[Erasmusbrug]] in the centre of the city, on the north shore of the river Nieuwe Maas. In 1941, 11,000 Jews still lived in Rotterdam. Before the war there were 13,000. Between 30 July 1942, and 22 April 1943, 6,790 people were deported in 8 transports via Loods 24. The vast majority of the Jews who were deported via Loods 24 were murdered in [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibór]] and [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]]. Research in 2000 showed that 144 people survived the deportations. In 2013 the {{Ill|Jewish Children's Monument|nl|Joods Kindermonument (Rotterdam)}} was unveiled.

In January 1948, [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]] presented the motto 'Sterker door strijd' (Stronger through effort) as part of the [[coat of arms of Rotterdam]] to the city government:

''...as a reminder also for posterity of the courage and strength with which the people of Rotterdam bore all the trials of the war and the important part they took in the liberation of the fatherland....''
—Wilhelmina of the Netherlands

Rotterdam was gradually rebuilt from the 1950s through to the 1970s. Because the city centre was largely destroyed, new spatial infrastructure could be built, making it an open and modern city. In 1953 the [[Lijnbaan]] was opened, the first car-free shopping street in Europe. The progressive design attracted a lot of international attention, in which film and television played an important role.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Paalman |first=Floris |title=Cinematic Rotterdam: The Times and Tides of a Modern City |publisher=010 Publishers |year=2011 |isbn=9789064507663 |location=Rotterdam |language=en}}</ref> The new [[Rotterdam Centraal station|Central Station]] was completed in 1957, with the [[Groothandelsgebouw]] from 1953 next to it. The [[Euromast]] was erected in 1960 on the occasion of the [[Floriade (Netherlands)|Floriade]].
From the 1980s onwards the city councils began developing an active architectural policy. The harbours were moving westwards and the old environment had to be reshaped. Daring and new styles of [[apartment]]s, office buildings and recreation facilities resulted in a more '[[Quality of life|livable]]' city centre with a new skyline. In the 1990s, the [[Kop van Zuid]] was built on the south bank of the river as a new business centre. Rotterdam was voted 2015 European City of the Year by the Academy of Urbanism.<ref name="Academy of Urbanism" /> A profile of Rem Koolhaas in ''[[The Guardian]]'' begins "If you put the last 50 years of architecture in a blender, and spat it out in building-sized chunks across the skyline, you would probably end up with something that looked a bit like Rotterdam".<ref name="Wainwright 2013">{{cite news |last=Wainwright |first=Oliver |title=Rem Koolhaas's De Rotterdam: cut and paste architecture |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/nov/18/rem-koolhaas-de-rotterdam-building |url-status=live |work=The Guardian |date=2013 |access-date=3 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190103210450/https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/nov/18/rem-koolhaas-de-rotterdam-building |archive-date=3 January 2019}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Rotterdam-plaats-OpenTopo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.55|left|Topographic map image of Rotterdam (city), as of September 2014]]

Rotterdam is divided into a northern and a southern part by the river Nieuwe Maas, connected by (from west to east): the Beneluxtunnel; the [[Maastunnel]]; the [[Erasmusbrug]]; a subway tunnel; the Willemsspoortunnel ('Willems railway tunnel'); the [[Willemsbrug]] ('Willems Bridge') together with the Koninginnebrug ('Queen's Bridge'); and the [[Van Brienenoordbrug]] ('Van Brienenoord Bridge'). The former railway lift bridge [[De Hef]] ('the Lift') is preserved as a [[Rijksmonument]] (national heritage site) in lifted position between the [[Noordereiland]] ('North Island') and the south of Rotterdam.
[[File:View of Rotterdam from the Euromast, Rotterdam-Centrum, Rotterdam (2023) 08.jpg|thumb|View of Rotterdam from the Euromast]]
The city centre is located on the northern bank of the Nieuwe Maas, although recent urban development has extended the centre to parts of southern Rotterdam known as [[Kop van Zuid]] ('the Head of South', i.e. the northern part of southern Rotterdam). From its inland core, Rotterdam reaches the [[North Sea]] by a swathe of predominantly harbour area.

Built mostly behind dikes, large parts of Rotterdam are below sea level. For instance, the Prins Alexander Polder in the northeast of Rotterdam extends {{cvt|6|m|ft}} below sea level, or rather below [[Normaal Amsterdams Peil]] (NAP) or 'Amsterdam Ordnance Datum'. The lowest point in the Netherlands ({{cvt|6.76|m|ft}} below NAP) is situated just to the east of Rotterdam, in the municipality of [[Nieuwerkerk aan den IJssel]].
[[File:Rotterdam by Sentinel-2, 2018-06-30.jpg|alt=|thumb|Satellite image of Rotterdam and its port]]

The [[Rotte (river)|Rotte]] river no longer joins the Nieuwe Maas directly. Since the early 1980s, when the construction of Rotterdam's second underground line interfered with the Rotte's course, its waters have been pumped through a pipe into the Nieuwe Maas via the Boerengat. [[File:Metropoolregio Rotterdam Den Haag (Rotterdam The Hague Metropolitan Area).svg|thumb|The 24 municipalities of the [[Rotterdam–The Hague metropolitan area]]]]

Between the summers of 2003 and 2008, an artificial [[beach]] was created at the Boompjeskade along the Nieuwe Maas, between the Erasmus Bridge and the Willems Bridge. [[human swimming|Swimming]] was not possible, digging pits was limited to the height of the layer of [[sand]], about {{cvt|50|cm|0}}. Alternatively, people go to the beach of [[Hook of Holland]] (which is a Rotterdam district) or one of the beaches in [[Zeeland]]: [[Renesse]] or the Zuid Hollandse Eilanden: [[Ouddorp]], [[Oostvoorne]].

Rotterdam forms the centre of the [[Rijnmond]] conurbation, bordering the conurbation surrounding [[The Hague]] to the north-west. The two conurbations are close enough to be a single conurbation. They share the [[Rotterdam The Hague Airport]] and a light rail system called [[RandstadRail]]. Consideration is being given to creating an official Metropolitan region Rotterdam The Hague (''Metropoolregio Rotterdam Den Haag''), which would have a combined population approaching 2.5 million.

In its turn, the Rijnmond conurbation is part of the southern wing (the [[Zuidvleugel]]) of the [[Randstad]], which is one of the most important economic and densely populated areas in the north-west of Europe. Having a population of 7.1 million, the Randstad is the [[List of metropolitan areas in Europe|sixth-largest]] [[urban area]] in [[Europe]] (after Moscow, London, Paris, Istanbul, and the Rhein-Ruhr Area). The Zuidvleugel, situated in the province of [[South Holland]], has a population of around 3 million.

===Climate===
Rotterdam experiences a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') similar to all of the coastal areas in the Netherlands. Located near to the coast, its climate is slightly milder than locations further inland. Winters are cool with frequent cold days, while the summers are mild to warm, with occasional hot temperatures. Temperature rises above 30&nbsp;°C on average 4 days each summer, while (night) temperatures can drop below −5&nbsp;°C during winter for short periods of time, mostly during periods of sustained easterly (continental) winds. Precipitation is generally moderate throughout the year, although spring and summer (particularly before August) are relatively drier and sunnier, while autumn and winter are cloudier with more frequent rain (or snow). The following climate data is from the airport, which is slightly cooler than the city, being surrounded by water canals which make the climate milder and with a higher [[relative humidity]]. The city has an [[urban heat island]], especially inside the city centre.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Heat Stress in Rotterdam |url=https://klimaatadaptatienederland.nl/en/@164058/heat-stress/ |access-date=29 April 2022 |website=Spatial adaptation |date=30 June 2011 |language=en |archive-date=14 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230414003506/https://klimaatadaptatienederland.nl/en/@164058/heat-stress/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

Rotterdam is diverse, with the demographics differing by neighbourhood. The city centre has a disproportionately high number of single people when compared to other cities, with 70% of the population between the ages of 20 and 40 identifying as single.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rotterdam Population 2018 (Demographics, Maps, Graphs) |url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/rotterdam-population/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116173257/http://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/rotterdam-population/ |archive-date=16 November 2018 |access-date=16 November 2018 |website=worldpopulationreview.com}}</ref> Those with higher education and higher income live disproportionately in the city centre, as do foreign-born citizens.

The [[Municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] of Rotterdam is part of the [[Rotterdam–The Hague metropolitan area]] which, as of 2015, covers an area of 1,130&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, of which 990&nbsp;km&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is land, and has a population of approximately 2,563,197. As of 2019, the municipality itself occupies an area of 325.79&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, 208.80&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of which is land, and is home to 638,751 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web |last=World Population Review |date=2019 |title=Population of Cities in Netherlands (2019) |url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/netherlands-population/cities/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711093539/http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/netherlands-population/cities/ |archive-date=11 July 2019 |access-date=11 July 2019}}</ref> Its population peaked at 731,564 in 1965, but the dual processes of [[suburbanization]] and [[counterurbanization]] saw this number steadily decline over the next 2 decades, reaching 560,000 by 1985.<ref>{{cite web |last=The Joseph Rowntree Foundation |date=2016 |title=International cities: case studies Rotterdam |url=https://www.jrf.org.uk/sites/default/files/jrf/files-research/international_cities_rotterdam.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711093545/https://www.jrf.org.uk/sites/default/files/jrf/files-research/international_cities_rotterdam.pdf |archive-date=11 July 2019 |access-date=11 July 2019}}</ref><ref name="Pijbes 2016">{{cite web |last=Pijbes |first=Wim |date=November 2016 |title=Rotterdam city of culture and tourist destination: a study |url=https://iabrotterdam.com/iab-en/assets/File/Analysis%20by%20Wim%20Pijbes.pdf |access-date=11 July 2019}}{{dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> Although Rotterdam has experienced population growth since then, it has done so at a slower pace than comparable cities in the Netherlands, like Amsterdam, The Hague and Utrecht.<ref name="Pijbes 2016" />

Rotterdam consists of 14 submunicipalities: [[Rotterdam Centrum|Centrum]], [[Charlois]] (including Heijplaat), [[Delfshaven]], [[Feijenoord]], [[Hillegersberg-Schiebroek]], [[Hook of Holland]], [[Hoogvliet]], [[IJsselmonde, Rotterdam|IJsselmonde]], [[Kralingen-Crooswijk]], [[Noord, Rotterdam|Noord]], [[Overschie]], [[Pernis, Netherlands|Pernis]], and [[Prins Alexander]] (the most populous submunicipality with around 85,000 inhabitants). One other area, [[Rozenburg]], does have an official submunicipality status since 18 March 2010. Since the status of a [[Deelgemeente|submunicipality]] was lifted on 19 March 2014, it became an integral part of the municipality of Rotterdam.

The size of the municipality of Rotterdam is the result of the amalgamation of the following former municipalities,<ref>{{Repertorium Nederlandse Gemeenten}}</ref> some of which were a [[Deelgemeente|submunicipality]] prior to 19 March 2014:

*[[Delfshaven]] (added on 30 January 1886)

===Origin background makeup===
In the Netherlands, Rotterdam has the highest percentage of residents with a recent migration background from non-industrialised nations. They form a large part of Rotterdam's multi-ethnic and multicultural diversity. 52.9% of the population have at least one parent born outside the country. There are 80,000 Muslims, constituting 13% of the population in 2010.<ref>{{Cite report |url=http://www.soros.org/initiatives/home/articles_publications/publications/muslims-rotterdam-20101119/a-muslims-rotterdam-report-en-20101119.pdf |title=Muslims in Rotterdam |last=Kim Jansen |publisher=[[Open Society Institute]] |access-date=29 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216132930/http://www.soros.org/initiatives/home/articles_publications/publications/muslims-rotterdam-20101119/a-muslims-rotterdam-report-en-20101119.pdf |archive-date=16 December 2010 |year=2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The former mayor of Rotterdam, [[Ahmed Aboutaleb]] (2009-2024), is of Moroccan descent and is a practicing Muslim.<ref>DutchNews.nl.

Rotterdam has always been one of the main centres of the shipping industry in the Netherlands. From the Rotterdam Chamber of the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]], the world's first multinational, established in 1602, to the merchant shipping leader Royal [[Nedlloyd]] established in 1970, with its corporate headquarters located in the landmark building the 'Willemswerf' in 1988.<ref>{{cite web |title=1997-2005 - PONLHeritage |url=https://sites.google.com/site/ponlheritage2//p-o-nedlloyd/1997-2005-the-ponl-years |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004074852/https://sites.google.com/site/ponlheritage2//p-o-nedlloyd/1997-2005-the-ponl-years |archive-date=4 October 2016 |access-date=24 July 2018 |publisher=P&O Nedlloyd}}</ref> In 1997, Nedlloyd merged with the British shipping industry leader P&O forming the third largest merchant shipping company in the world. The Anglo-Dutch [[P&O Nedlloyd]] was bought by the Danish giant corporation 'AP Moller [[A. P. Moller-Maersk Group|Maersk]]' in 2005 and its Dutch operations are still headquartered in the 'Willemswerf'. Nowadays, well-known companies with headquarters in Rotterdam are consumer goods company [[Unilever]] (since 2020 London), asset management firm [[Robeco]], energy company [[Eneco Energie|Eneco]], dredging company [[Van Oord]], oil company [[Shell plc|Royal Dutch Shell]] (since 2021 [[London]]), terminal operator [[Vopak]], commodity trading company [[Vitol]] and architecture firm [[Office for Metropolitan Architecture]].

It is also home to the regional headquarters of chemical company [[LyondellBasell]], commodities trading company [[Glencore]], pharmaceutical company [[Pfizer]], logistics companies [[Stolt-Nielsen]], electrical equipment company [[ABB]] and consumer goods company [[Procter & Gamble]]. Furthermore, Rotterdam has the Dutch headquarters of [[Allianz]], [[Maersk]], [[Petrobras]], [[Samskip]], [[Louis Dreyfus Group]], and [[Aon (company)|Aon]]. The City of Rotterdam makes use of the services of semi-government companies [[Roteb]] (to take care of [[sanitation]], [[waste management]] and assorted services) and the Port of Rotterdam Authority (to maintain the [[Port of Rotterdam]]). Both these companies were once municipal bodies; now they are autonomous entities, owned by the city.

Being the largest port and one of the largest cities of the country, Rotterdam attracts many people seeking jobs, especially in the cheap labour segment. The city's unemployment rate is 12%, almost twice the national average.<ref>{{cite web |date=23 April 2009 |title=Werkloosheid in Rotterdam KNSexamen: Weblog Inburgering, NT2, examen |url=http://www.knsexamen.nl/?p=227 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724160116/http://www.knsexamen.nl/?p=227 |archive-date=24 July 2011 |access-date=12 April 2011 |publisher=Knsexamen.nl}}</ref> Rotterdam is the largest [[port]] in [[Europe]], with the rivers [[Meuse (river)|Maas]] and [[Rhine]] providing excellent access to the [[hinterland]] upstream reaching to [[Basel|Basel, Switzerland]] and into France. In 2004 [[Shanghai]] took over as the world's [[List of busiest container ports|busiest container port]]. In 2006, Rotterdam was the world's seventh largest [[Containerization|container port]] in terms of [[twenty-foot equivalent unit]]s (TEU) handled.<ref>{{cite web |title=Home |url=http://www.portofrotterdam.com/en/home/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415205510/http://www.portofrotterdam.com/en/home/ |archive-date=15 April 2009 |access-date=6 May 2009 |publisher=Port of Rotterdam}}</ref> The port's main activities are [[petrochemical]] industries and general [[cargo]] handling and [[transshipment]]. The harbour functions as an important transit point for [[bulk material handling|bulk]] materials between the European continent and overseas. From Rotterdam, goods are transported by ship, river barge, train or road. In 2007, the ''[[Betuweroute]]'', a new fast freight [[rail transport|railway]] from Rotterdam to [[Germany]], was completed.

Well-known streets in Rotterdam are the [[Lijnbaan]] (the first set of [[pedestrian mall|pedestrian streets]] of the country, opened in 1953), the Hoogstraat, the [[Coolsingel]] with the city hall, which was renovated between 2018 and 2021 giving cyclists and pedestrians more space, meaning that car traffic was reduced from 4 lanes (2 in each direction) to 2 lanes (1 in each direction). Another mainstreet is the [[Weena (Rotterdam)|Weena]], which runs from the Central Station to the [[Hofplein]] (square). A modern shopping venue is the Beurstraverse ("Stock Exchange Traverse"), better known by its informal name '[[Koopgoot]]' ('Buying/Shopping Gutter', after its subterranean position), which crosses the Coolsingel below street level. The Kruiskade is a more upscale shopping street, with retailers like [[Michael Kors]], [[7 For All Mankind]], [[Calvin Klein]], [[Hugo Boss]], [[Tommy Hilfiger]] and the Dutch well-known men's clothier [[Oger (clothing retailer)|Oger]]. Another upscale shopping venue is a flagship store of department store [[De Bijenkorf]]. Located a little more to the east is the [[Market hall (Rotterdam)|Markthal]], with lots of small retailers inside. This hall is also one of Rotterdam's famous architectural landmarks. The main shopping venue in the south of Rotterdam is Zuidplein, which lies close to [[Rotterdam Ahoy]], an accommodation centre for shows, exhibitions, sporting events, concerts and congresses. Another prominent shopping centre called Alexandrium lies in the east of Rotterdam. It includes a large kitchen and furniture centre.

==Education==
[[File:Rotterdam standbeeld Erasmus.jpg|thumb|Bronze statue of [[Erasmus]], created by [[Hendrick de Keyser]] in 1622]]
Rotterdam has one major university, the [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]] (EUR), named after one of the city's famous former inhabitants, [[Desiderius Erasmus]]. The Woudestein campus houses (among others) [[Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University]]. In [[Financial Times]]' 2005 rankings it placed 29th globally and 7th in Europe. In the 2009 rankings of Masters of Management, the school reached first place with the [[Global Alliance in Management Education|CEMS]] Master in Management and the tenth place with its RSM Master in Management.<ref>{{cite web |title=Business School Ranking of the Financial Times 2009 |url=http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/masters-in-management |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324061111/http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/masters-in-management |archive-date=24 March 2009 |access-date=12 April 2011 |publisher=Rankings.ft.com}}</ref> The university is also home to Europe's largest student association, [[STAR (student association)|STAR Study Association Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University]] and the world's largest student association, [[AIESEC]], has its international office in the city.

The [[Willem de Kooning Academy]] is Rotterdam's main art school, which is part of the Hogeschool Rotterdam. It is regarded as one of the most prestigious art schools in the Netherlands and the number 1 in Advertising and Copywriting. Part of the [[Willem de Kooning Academy]] is the [[Piet Zwart Institute]] for postgraduate studies and research in Fine Art, Media Design and Retail Design. The Piet Zwart Institute boasts a selective roster of emerging international artists.

The Hoboken campus of EUR houses the Dijkzigt (general) hospital, the Sophia Hospital (for children), [[:nl:Daniel den Hoedkliniek|Daniel den Hoed clinic]] (cancer institute) and the medical department of the university. They are known collectively as the [[Erasmus MC|Erasmus Medical Center]]. This center is ranked third in Europe by CSIC<ref>{{cite web |title=Europe {{!}} Ranking Web of Hospitals |url=http://hospitals.webometrics.info/en/europe |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170719074750/http://hospitals.webometrics.info/en/europe |archive-date=19 July 2017 |access-date=14 July 2017 |website=hospitals.webometrics.info}}</ref> as a hospital, and is also ranked within top 50 universities of the world in the field of medicine (clinical, pre-clinical & health, 2017).<ref>{{cite web |title=Erasmus University Rotterdam |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/erasmus-university-rotterdam#ranking-dataset/595522 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222065027/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/erasmus-university-rotterdam#ranking-dataset/595522 |archive-date=22 February 2017 |access-date=14 July 2017 |website=Times Higher Education (THE) |language=en-US}}</ref>

Three ''[[Vocational university|Hogescholen]]'' (Universities of applied sciences) exist in Rotterdam. These schools award their students a professional [[Bachelor's degree]] and postgraduate or [[Master's degree]]. The three ''Hogescholen'' are [[Hogeschool Rotterdam]], [[Inholland University of Applied Sciences|Hogeschool Inholland]] and [[Codarts|Codarts University for the Arts]] (Codarts hogeschool voor de kunsten), a vocational university that teaches music, dance and circus.

==Culture==
[[File:HerdenkingVuurgrensRotterdam1940 2007 edit1.jpg|thumb|Rotterdam waterfront, with spotlights shining into the air to commemorate the [[Rotterdam Blitz]]]]
Once primarily a city of labour, for its harbour and related industries, Rotterdam has now developed into a city of culture too, with various museums, cultural centres and activities, offering a stage for [[#Architecture|architecture]], music, visuals arts, poetry, cinema, theatre, and culture more generally, with a range of festivals and other events, and a buzzing nightlife. The city has its own orchestra, the [[Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra]], with its well-regarded young music director [[Lahav Shani]], which plays at the congress and concert building ''[[De Doelen]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra |url=https://www.rotterdamsphilharmonisch.nl/ |access-date=20 December 2023 |website=www.rotterdamsphilharmonisch.nl |language=nl}}</ref>  The [[Rotterdam Ahoy|Ahoy]] complex in the south of the city is used for pop concerts, exhibitions, tennis tournaments and other activities. There are also several theatres and cinemas, including [[New Orleans (Rotterdam)|LantarenVenster]] and [[Cinerama (Rotterdam)|Cinerama.]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Cinerama Rotterdam (1960 – heden) |url=https://bioscoopgeschiedenis.com/bioscopen/zuid-holland/rotterdam/cinerama-rotterdam-1960-heden.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190324135749/https://bioscoopgeschiedenis.com/bioscopen/zuid-holland/rotterdam/cinerama-rotterdam-1960-heden.html |archive-date=24 March 2019 |access-date=20 July 2020 |website=Bioscoop Geschiedenis}}</ref> 

Alongside [[Porto]], Rotterdam was [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2001.

=== Museums, libraries and archives ===
Rotterdam has various cultural institutions. Well-known [[museum]]s are the [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]], [[Het Nieuwe Instituut]], the [[Wereldmuseum]], the [[Kunsthal]], [[Kunstinstituut Melly]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Witte de With museum |url=http://www.wdw.nl |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519121705/http://www.wdw.nl/ |archive-date=19 May 2008 |access-date=15 May 2008}}</ref> and the [[Maritime Museum Rotterdam]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Maritiem Museum official site |url=http://www.maritiemmuseum.nl |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010220183748/http://www.maritiemmuseum.nl/ |archive-date=20 February 2001 |access-date=15 May 2008}}</ref> The Historical Museum Rotterdam has changed into [[Museum Rotterdam]], which aims to exhibit the development of Rotterdam as a contemporary transnational city, and not merely the city's past.<ref>[https://museumrotterdam.nl/en/ Museum Rotterdam] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505051131/https://museumrotterdam.nl/en/|date=5 May 2016}}, retrieved 25 April 2016.</ref> Other museums include the [[:nl:Belasting & Douane Museum|Tax & Customs Museum]], the [[Netherlands Marine Corps Museum]], [[Rotterdam Public Transport Museum]] and the [[Natural History Museum Rotterdam|Natural History Museum]].
In 2025 'Fenix, Museum for Migration' will be opened.<ref>De volkskrant, 18 December 2023, p. V2-3.</ref>

The first municipal library of Rotterdam was founded in 1604. The current [[:nl:Bibliotheek_Rotterdam|Bibliotheek Rotterdam]] (Public library), was established in 1869, and is currently the largest cultural organization in Rotterdam, with fifteen branches across the city. 

The Rotterdam City Archives (''Stadsarchief Rotterdam'') was established in 1857. Here one can find administrative records and sources about the city's historical development.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Stadsarchief Rotterdam |title=Archives |url=https://www.stadsarchief.rotterdam.nl/english/search/archives/index.xml |access-date=24 December 2023 |website=Stadsarchief Rotterdam |language=nl}}</ref> The archival holdings include, among other, general archives, notarial deeds, an audiovisual collection, and a library.

=== Popular music, film, festivals ===
Rotterdam has a long tradition of popular music, including the city's Jazz scene before and after WWII.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Zirkzee |first=Hans |title=Jazz in Rotterdam: De geschiedenis van een grote stadscultuur |publisher=Uitgeverij Lecturis |year=2015 |isbn=9789462261334 |location=Eindhoven}}</ref> A major historical moment in the city's music history is the legendary [[Kralingen Music Festival|Kralingen Pop Festival]], which took place in Rotterdam in 1970 (featuring, among other, [[Pink Floyd]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[The Byrds]], [[Canned Heat]], [[It's a Beautiful Day]], and [[Santana (band)|Santana]]). The festival was also made into a film, ''Stamping Ground'' (dir. George Sluizer).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Eye Filmmuseum |title=Stamping Ground [Film 1970] |url=https://player.eyefilm.nl/nl/films/stamping-ground-directors-cut |access-date=24 December 2023 |website=Eye Film Player}}</ref> Alternative (music) culture became prominently present in the city in these days. From the 1960s until the 2000s, Rotterdam had a thriving [[squatting|squatters movement]], which not only accommodated thousands of people, but also created social centres and cultural venues.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Dee |first=E.T.C. |title=Squatting the Grey City |date=2018 |publisher=Cobble Books |isbn=9780244385804 |location=Rotterdam |page=256}}</ref> From this movement came clubs like Boogjes, Eksit, Nighttown, Vlerk and Waterfront. A major reference is [[Poortgebouw]], which was squatted in 1980 and quickly legalised.  

Rotterdam also became the home of [[Gabber]], a type of hardcore electronic music popular in the mid-1990s, with hard beats and samples. Groups like [[Neophyte (band)|Neophyte]] and [[Rotterdam Terror Corps]] (RTC) started in Rotterdam, playing at clubs like Parkzicht. In the years 2005–2011, the city struggled with keeping venues for pop music; many of them suffered severe financial problems.<ref>{{Cite web |date=19 July 2006 |title=Nighttown gesloten door curator |url=https://3voor12.vpro.nl/artikelen/overzicht/2006/juli/nighttown-gesloten-door-curator.html |access-date=20 December 2023 |website=3voor12 |language=nl}}</ref> This resulted in the disappearance of the major music venues Nighttown and WATT and smaller stages such as Waterfront, Exit, and Heidegger. The city today has a few stages for [[pop music]], like [[Rotown]], [[Poortgebouw]] and Annabel. Additionally, the venue [[WORM (Rotterdam)|WORM]] focuses on [[experimental music]], as well as various other cultural activities.   

WORM also screens films and hosts a film lab, ''Filmwerkplaats''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Worm |title=Filmwerkplaats - Worm - A Rotterdam based organisation working at the intersection of culture and arts. |url=https://worm.org/spaces/filmwerkplaats/ |access-date=24 December 2023 |website=Worm |language=en}}</ref> In fact, Rotterdam has an extensive film history,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Paalman |first=Floris |title=Cinematic Rotterdam: The Times and Tides of a Modern City |publisher=010 Publishers |year=2011 |isbn=9789064507663 |publication-place=Rotterdam}}</ref> ranging from avant-garde classics, such as [[De brug|The Bridge]] ([[Joris Ivens|Ivens]], 1928), to internationally acclaimed documentaries from the post-war era, such as [[Houen zo!|Steady!]] (Van der Horst, 1952), and all kinds of fiction films. Of major importance within this context has also been the [[International Film Festival Rotterdam]] (IFFR), an annual event that lasts more than ten days (end of January, beginning of February), which has been organized since 1972. Besides the IFFR, several smaller film festivals take place in Rotterdam too, such as the [[Architecture Film Festival Rotterdam]] (AFFR).   

Throughout the year, many different festivals take place in Rotterdam. There are the summer festivals celebrating the city's multicultural population and identity, such as the Caribbean-inspired "[[Summer Carnival]]", the Dance Parade, Rotterdam 666, and the Metropolis pop festival. There are also [[Poetry International Web|Poetry International]] (in June), the [[North Sea Jazz Festival]] (in July), the Valery Gergiev Festival (in September), and, also in September, the festival 'September in Rotterdam', the festival 'World of the Witte de With Quaret', and the [[World Port Days]]. 

=== Eurovision Song Contest ===
[[File:ESC 2021 Rotterdam - Artwork at Ahoy Parking.jpg|thumb|City decor for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2021]]|left]]
On 30 August 2019, it was announced by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] and Dutch television broadcasters [[AVROTROS]], [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] and [[Nederlandse Publieke Omroep (organization)|NPO]], that Rotterdam would host the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2020]], following the Dutch victory at the {{Escyr|2019}} contest in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]] with the song "[[Arcade (song)|Arcade]]", performed by [[Duncan Laurence]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Rotterdam to host Eurovision 2020! |date=30 August 2019 |url=https://eurovision.tv/story/rotterdam-to-host-eurovision-2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002072007/https://eurovision.tv/story/rotterdam-to-host-eurovision-2020 |archive-date=2 October 2019 |access-date=30 August 2019}}</ref> However, due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Europe]], the 2020 contest was cancelled, and Rotterdam was later retained as host of the {{Escyr|2021}} contest.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official EBU statement & FAQ on Eurovision 2020 cancellation |date=18 March 2020 |url=https://eurovision.tv/official-ebu-statement-and-faq-eurovision-song-contest-2020-cancellation |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200318142008/https://eurovision.tv/official-ebu-statement-and-faq-eurovision-song-contest-2020-cancellation |archive-date=18 March 2020 |access-date=6 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Rotterdam returns as Eurovision Song Contest Host City in 2021 |date=16 May 2020 |url=https://eurovision.tv/story/eurovision-song-contest-to-return-to-rotterdam-in-2021 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200517081418/https://eurovision.tv/story/eurovision-song-contest-to-return-to-rotterdam-in-2021 |archive-date=17 May 2020 |access-date=16 May 2020}}</ref> The contest took place at [[Rotterdam Ahoy]], with the semi-finals taking place on 18 and 20 May 2021, and the final taking place on 22 May 2021.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dates for Eurovision 2021 announced |date=15 June 2020 |url=https://eurovision.tv/story/dates-for-eurovision-2021-announced |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200615113932/https://eurovision.tv/story/dates-for-eurovision-2021-announced |archive-date=15 June 2020 |access-date=15 June 2020}}</ref> This was the first time that Rotterdam hosted the contest, and the first time that the Netherlands hosted the contest since {{Escyr|1980}}, when it was held in [[The Hague]].

=== Rivalry ===
There is a healthy competition with [[Amsterdam]], which is often viewed as the cultural capital of the Netherlands. This rivalry is most common amongst the city's football supporters, [[Feyenoord]] (Rotterdam) and [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] (Amsterdam). There is a saying: "Amsterdam to party, Den Haag (The Hague) to live, Rotterdam to work". Another one, more popular by Rotterdammers, is "Money is earned in Rotterdam, distributed in The Hague and spent in Amsterdam".<ref>Joanna Shapland (Editor){{google books|UF0EXPYmo-4C|Justice, Community Civil Society: A Contested Terrain (2013)|page=92}}</ref> Another saying that reflects both the rivalry between Rotterdam and Amsterdam is "Amsterdam has it, Rotterdam doesn't need it". Bright magazine editor Erwin van der Zande notes that this phrase is on T-shirts in Rotterdam.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rotterdam, Netherlands – We Be High |url=https://webehigh.org/rotterdam-netherlands/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200704231628/https://webehigh.org/rotterdam-netherlands/ |archive-date=4 July 2020 |access-date=4 July 2020}}</ref>

===History===
In 1898, the {{cvt|45|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off}} high-rise office building the White House (in Dutch [[Witte Huis]]) was completed, at that time the tallest office building in Europe.
In the first decades of the 20th century, some influential architecture in the modern style was built in Rotterdam. Notable are the [[Van Nelle Factory|Van Nelle fabriek]] (1929) a monument of modern factory design by [[Johannes Brinkman|Brinkman]] and [[Leendert van der Vlugt|Van der Vlugt]], the [[Art Nouveau|Jugendstil]] clubhouse of the [[Royal Maas Yacht Club]] designed by Hooijkaas jr. en Brinkman (1909), and [[Feyenoord]]'s football stadium [[De Kuip]] (1936) also by [[Johannes Brinkman|Brinkman]] and [[Leendert van der Vlugt|Van der Vlugt]]. The architect [[Jacobus Oud|J. J. P. Oud]] was a famous Rotterdammer in those days. The Van Nelle Factory obtained the status of UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in 2014.
During the early stages of [[World War II]] the centre of Rotterdam was [[Rotterdam Blitz|bombed]] by the German [[Luftwaffe]], destroying many of the older buildings in the centre of the city. After an initial crisis re-construction, the centre of Rotterdam has become the site of the ambitious new architecture.

[[File:Euromast2.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Euromast]] in 2005]]

Rotterdam is also famous for its [[Lijnbaan]] 1952 by architects Broek en Bakema, Peperklip by architect Carel Weeber, Kubuswoningen or [[cube house]]s designed by architect [[Piet Blom]] 1984.

The newest landmark in Rotterdam is the [[Market hall (Rotterdam)|Markthal]], designed by architect firm [[MVRDV]]. In addition to that, there are many international well-known architects based in Rotterdam like [[Office for Metropolitan Architecture|O.M.A]] ([[Rem Koolhaas]]), [[Neutelings Riedijk Architects|Neutelings & Riedijk]] and [[Erick van Egeraat]] to name a few. Two architectural landmarks are located in the Lloydkwartier: the STC college building and the [[Schiecentrale|Schiecentrale 4b]]. The construction of the Depot of the [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]] was started in 2003 and was officially opened by king Willem-Alexander on 5 November 2021. It is the world's first fully accessible art depot.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mvrdv.nl/projects/10/depot-boijmans-van-beuningen |title=MVRDV - Depot Boijmans Van Beuningen |publisher=Mvrdv.nl |date= |accessdate=10 February 2022 |archive-date=10 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220110131514/https://www.mvrdv.nl/projects/10/depot-boijmans-van-beuningen |url-status=live }}</ref>[[File:Erasmusbrug across the Nieuwe Maas river.jpg|thumb|[[Erasmusbrug|Erasmus Bridge]] in 2011]]

===Parks===
Within Rotterdam's urban structure, parks and greenery play an important role. A number of well-known parks in Rotterdam are:[[File:Arboretum Trompenburg Nl 2.jpg|thumb|right|Arboretum Trompenburg]]
*''Het Park'' ([[:nl:Het_Park_(Rotterdam)|Het Park bij de Euromast]]), is a 70 acres park on the Maas, south of the Westzeedijk, at the [[Euromast]]. The eastern half of the park was constructed between 1852 and 1863 to a design by the firm Jan David Zocher. The western part was added in 1866 with some modifications. The first [[Floriade (Netherlands)|Floriade]] in 1960 was held in Het Park, with the Euromast observation tower being erected to mark the event. [[Rijksmonument|National Heritage site]] since 2011. Originally, the park continued aross the Westzeedijk, were the Medical Faculty was built in the 1960s (now Erasmus MC). See also: Museumpark.
*[[Museumpark]], close to Het Park, was originally designed in 1927 by architect W.G. Witteveen, who also designed [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]]. Today, several museums have clustered around the park. 
*[[Diergaarde Blijdorp]], which is situated on the northwest side of Rotterdam, complete with a walkthrough sea aquarium, called the [[Oceanium]].
*[[Arboretum Trompenburg]] in [[Kralingen]]. The park dates back to 1820, but it was only after it was opened to the public in 1958 that the park, which was managed by the (Van Hoey) Smith family for generations, gained wider attention. The park, approximately 20 acres in size, contains approximately 4,000 different types of trees, shrubs and perennials, amongst others the national plant collections of [[conifers]], ''[[Quercus]]'', ''[[Beech|Fagus]]'', ''[[Rhododendron]]'', ''[[Ligustrum]]'', ''[[Rodgersia]]'' and ''[[Hosta]]''.
*''Park Schoonoord'' (3 acres) is located in the [[Scheepvaartkwartier]] and was designed in its current form in 1860 by Jan David Zocher.
*The [[Kralingen-Crooswijk|''Kralingse Bos'']] (500 acres) with the [[Kralingse Plas]] (250 acres) is located in the [[Kralingen]] district and has been based on a design by [[Marinus Jan Granpré Molière]] since 1928.

==== Green activities ====
Since 28 May 1994, Rotterdam has had the phenomenon [[wiktionary:opzoomeren|''Opzoomeren'']]. 15% of Rotterdam residents (about 100,000 residents) say they participate in this phenomenon.<ref>Data Omnibus Survey 2016 of the Municipality of Rotterdam.</ref> At the end of 2020, the city has a record number of 2,503 Opzoomer streets,<ref>[https://www.opzoomermee.nl/over-opzoomeren/ A history of Opzoomeren] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221122112948/https://www.opzoomermee.nl/over-opzoomeren/|date=22 November 2022}} (Dutch).</ref> which is mainly reflected in the construction of facade gardens.

[[File:Dakpark Rotterdam.jpg|thumb|right|Dakpark Rotterdam]]
The municipality of Rotterdam is encouraging the construction of [[green roof]]s. There is an attractive subsidy for roof owners and the city has now provided a number of municipal buildings with a green roof. As of 1 January 2020, the water storage capacity requirement has been increased to 30 liters of water storage capacity per square metre. This reduces the burden on the sewer system during heavy rainfall and reduces the risk of flooding on the street.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Groene daken |url=https://www.rotterdam.nl/wonen-leven/groene-daken/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929231316/https://www.rotterdam.nl/wonen-leven/groene-daken/ |archive-date=29 September 2017 |access-date=18 May 2022}}</ref>
*The city's largest green roof is located on top of the [[Groothandelsgebouw]] next to Central Station.
*The ''Dakakker'' is the largest roof farm in Europe on top of the Schieblok.
*The ''Dakpark'' is an elongated, narrow park in the district [[Bospolder-Tussendijken]] in Rotterdam-West. It has been built at a height of about nine meters, is about 85 meters wide and extends for about a kilometer from Hudson Square to near Marconi Square.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20161230161647/http://www.nederlandwordtanders.nl/projecten/dakpark-rotterdam/ Article about Dakpark on Nederlandwordtanders.nl]</ref>
*The municipality of Rotterdam will provide the flat roof of the conference and concert building [[De Doelen]] with greenery and water storage. The design for the roof was made by Kraijvanger Architects.<ref>Robert Muis (ed.). De Doelen Rotterdam will have a green roof with water storage.

===Tour de France===
In November 2008 Rotterdam was chosen as the host of the [[Grand Départ]] of the [[2010 Tour de France]].
Rotterdam won the selection over the Dutch city of [[Utrecht]]. Germany's Düsseldorf had previously also expressed interest in hosting. The [[Amaury Sport Organisation]] (ASO), the organizer of the Tour de France, said in a statement on its web site that it chose Rotterdam because, in addition to it being another big city, like London, to showcase the use of bikes for urban transportation, it provided a location well-positioned considering the rest of the route envisioned for the 2010 event.

==Transportation==
Rotterdam offers connections by international, national, regional and local public transport systems, as well as by the Dutch [[motorway]] network.

'''Motorways'''<br />
There are several motorways to/from Rotterdam. The following four are part of its 'Ring' ([[ring road]]):
*[[A20 motorway (Netherlands)|A20]] (Ring North): [[Hook of Holland]] – ''Rotterdam'' – [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]]
*[[A16 motorway (Netherlands)|A16]] (Ring East): ''Rotterdam'' – [[Breda]] (– [[Antwerp]] – [[Paris]])
*[[A15 motorway (Netherlands)|A15]] (Ring South): [[Europoort]] – ''Rotterdam'' – [[Nijmegen]]
*[[A4 motorway (Netherlands)|A4]] (Ring West): ''Rotterdam'' – [[The Hague]] (– [[Amsterdam]])
The following two other motorways also serve Rotterdam:
*[[A13 motorway (Netherlands)|A13]] ([[Amsterdam]] –): [[The Hague]] – [[Delft]] – ''Rotterdam''
*[[A29 motorway (Netherlands)|A29]] ([[Antwerp]] –): [[Bergen op Zoom]] – ''Rotterdam''

'''Airport'''<br />
Much smaller than the international hub [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Schiphol Airport]], [[Rotterdam The Hague Airport]] (formerly known as ''Zestienhoven'') is the third-largest [[airport]] in the country, behind [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Schiphol Airport]] and [[Eindhoven Airport]]. Located north of the city, it has shown solid growth over the past five years, mostly caused by the growth of the [[low-cost carrier]] market. For business travellers, Rotterdam The Hague Airport offers advantages in terms of rapid handling of passengers and baggage. Environmental regulations make further growth uncertain.
