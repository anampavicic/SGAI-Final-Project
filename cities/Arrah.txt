==Typonym==
According to a Jain inscription found at Masarh village near the town, Arrah is mentioned there as ''Aramnagar'' ([[Literal translation|transl.]] City of [[Vihāra|Aramas]]). That "Aramnagar" later become "Arrah".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.heritageuniversityofkerala.com/JournalPDF/Volume5/28.pdf|title=Lion Motif in Mauryan Art: Indigenous or Foreign?|website=heritageuniversityofkerala.com|access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Rana|date=September 2019|title=Masarh : A Great Archaeo-Historic Site of Bihar|journal=J.

According to mythologies, the word "Arrah" or "Ara" is derived from the Sanskrit word ''Aranya'', which means forest. It suggests that the entire area around modern Ara was heavily forested in the old days.<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=https://bhojpur.nic.in/history/ |title=History &#124; Welcome To Bhojpur District &#124; India |publisher=Bhojpur.nic.in |date=18 October 2019}}</ref><ref name="tourism">{{cite book |last1=Sinha |first1=Nishi |title=Tourism Perspective in Bihar |publisher=APH Publishing |isbn=9788170249757 |page=77 |year=1999}}</ref>

Arrah has also historically been known as '''Shahabad''', a name given to it by [[Babur]] in 1529, when he camped here after his victory against the Afghans of Bihar. The name "Shahabad" means "city of the king" and was used in the former [[Shahabad district]].<ref name="Ansari">{{cite book |last1=Ansari |first1=Tahir Hussain |title=Mughal Administration and the Zamindars of Bihar |date=2019 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781000651522 |pages=34–35 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iftaR6DVxIAC |access-date=15 August 2020}}</ref>

[[Pandava]] came to Ekchakra during their wandering and they were entertained by a [[Brahmin]] whose turn it was to supply a human for the demon. On hearing this, [[Bhima]] decided to go himself to the demon as he has eaten a Brahmin's salt, and killed the demon.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bihar And Orissa Gazetteers Shahabad|pages=151–152}}</ref>
