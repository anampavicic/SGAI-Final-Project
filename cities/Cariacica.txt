==History==
Before the arrival of the colonists to this area, [[Tupiniquim]] Indians made this area their home. The name "Cariacica" comes from their language, meaning "the arrival of white men". Cariacica was created as a district of [[Vitória, Brazil|Vitória]] on 18 December 1837. Its full name as it was given by the Catholic Church is "Freguesia de São João Batista de Cariacica", after [[Saint John the Baptist]], the patron saint of the town. On 30 December 1890 Cariacica separated fully from the municipality of [[Vitória, Brazil|Vitória]], becoming the capital of its own municipality. Since 24 July 1971 Saint John the Baptist's day has been the city's commemorative day.

==Colonization==
After the initial settlement instigated as a point of contact between the capital [[Vitória, Brazil|Vitória]] and the interior, between 1829 and 1833 some [[Pomerania]]n families arrived to the area. Population increased much more significantly after 1865, because of the formation of German colonies which headed to [[Santa Leopoldina, ES, Brazil|Santa Leopoldina]] and [[Santa Isabel, Brazil|Santa Isabel]]. In 1837 a group of Portuguese also arrived to establish themselves in the rural district of the municipality.

==Sports==
[[Rio Branco Atlético Clube]] is a [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in the city. The club is the most successful team of the state, being the club with most [[Campeonato Capixaba]] titles. It plays at [[Estádio Kléber Andrade]]. Another city's football club is [[Desportiva Ferroviária]].
