'''ʻArish''' or '''el-ʻArīsh''' ({{langx|ar|العريش}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-ʿArīš&nbsp;}}'' {{IPA|arz|elʕæˈɾiːʃ}}) is the [[capital city|capital]] and largest city (with 164,830 inhabitants {{As of|2012|lc=on}}) of the [[North Sinai Governorate]] of Egypt, as well as the largest city on the [[Sinai Peninsula]], lying on the [[Mediterranean]] coast {{convert|344|km|mi}} northeast of [[Cairo]] and {{convert|45|km|mi}} west of the [[Egypt–Gaza border]].

In Antiquity and Early Middle Ages the city was known as '''[[Rhinocorura|Rinokoroura]]''' ({{Langx|grc|Ῥινοκόρουρα}}, {{Langx|cop|ϩⲣⲓⲛⲟⲕⲟⲣⲟⲩⲣⲁ}}).<ref>{{Cite web |title=TM Places |url=https://www.trismegistos.org/place/2052 |access-date=2023-04-20 |website=www.trismegistos.org}}</ref>

ʻArīsh is located at the mouth of {{interlanguage link|Wadi el-ʻArīsh|ru|Эль-Ариш (вади)}} ({{interlanguage link|Wadi El Arish|he|ואדי אל-עריש}}), a {{convert|250|km|mi}} long [[Intermittent river|ephemeral]] watercourse. The [[Egyptian Protectorates|Azzaraniq Protectorate]] is on the eastern side of ʻArīsh.<ref><span class="plainlinks">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/34362/Al-Arish Arish]</span>. Britannica.com</ref>

== Etymology ==
There are several hypothetical possibilities for the origin of the modern name of the city, which is first mentioned under it in the 9th century. One possibility is that the name might be an Arab phonetic transcription of a pre-existing toponym. However, there is no name that fully qualifies as such, apart from the Ariza ({{Langx|grc|Αριζα}}) of [[Hierocles (author of Synecdemus)|Hierokles]], which is difficult to interpret.

Another possibility is that the name el-Arish was given to a city that already existed in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period. However, no Arab source mentions such a change of name for any city in the region, and there is no plausible explanation for this change.

A third possibility is that the name el-Arish was created when a new settlement of some "huts" ({{Langx|ar|عرش|translit=ʕarš}}) was established in the [[7th century|7th]] or [[8th century]]. It is possible that the city of Rinokoloura fell into ruins in the first half of the 7th century, and a new community arose that the new inhabitants started to call el-Arish, after their poor living conditions.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Verreth |first=Herbert |title=The northern Sinai from the 7th century BC till the 7th century AD. A guide to the sources |publisher=Leuven |year=2006 |volume=1 |pages=322–325}}</ref>

M. Ignace de Rossi derived the Arabic name from the Egyptian {{langx|cop|ϫⲟⲣϣⲁ(ⲓ)|transliteration=Jorsha|translation=noseless|label=none}}, an analogue of Greek Rinocorura.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rossii |first1=Ignatii |title=Etymologiae Aegyptiacae |date=1808 |location=Rome |pages=16–17}}</ref>

A Coptic-Arabic colophon dating to [[1616]] mentions the writer "Solomon of Shorpo, son of Michael, from the city of Mohonon" (ⲥⲱⲗⲟⲙⲟⲛ ⲛϣⲱⲣⲡⲟ ⲡϣⲏⲣⲓ ⲙⲓⲭⲁⲏⲗ ⲛⲧⲉ ⲡⲟⲗⲓⲥ ⲙⲟϩⲟⲛⲟⲛ); in the Arabic version, the writer is identified as being "of el-Arish".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hebbelynck |first=Adolphe |title=Codices Coptici Vaticani |publisher=Vatican Library |year=1937 |location=Vatican |pages=92}}</ref> Timm raises the possibility that ''Shorpo'' ({{Langx|cop|ϣⲱⲣⲡⲟ}}) may be another name for el-Arish.

== History ==
[[Herodotus]] describes a city named ''Ienysos'' ({{Langx|grc|Ιηνυσος}}) located between [[Lake Bardawil|Lake Serbonis]] and [[Gaza City|Kadytis]]. It is possible that Ienysos is the predecessor of Rinokoloura, but there is no clear evidence to support this identification.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Verreth |first=Herbert |title=The northern Sinai from the 7th century BC till the 7th century AD. A guide to the sources |publisher=Leuven |year=2006 |volume=1 |pages=263}}</ref>

=== Foundation ===
The foundation of the city is closely linked to the etymology of its name. The explanation given by the classic authors is that it comes from a compound of "nose" ({{Langx|grc|ῥίς}}) and "curtail, cut short" ({{Langx|grc|κολούω}}).

Thus modern scholars, following the version given by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], believe that in the 4th century BC, a [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] king, believed to be either [[Artaxerxes II]] or [[Artaxerxes III]], conducted a campaign in [[Syria (region)|Syria]] where he punished people, possibly a tribe, by mutilating their noses. As a result, the places where these people came from or relocated to were given new names that reflected their disfigurement. While the Greek name Rinokoloura may have existed from the outset, it is possible that it was a translation of a name with the same meaning in another language.

When the city became a part of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Empire]], an Egyptian tradition emerged that may have transformed the Persian king into an [[Ancient Ethiopia|Ethiopian]] king named [[Actisanes]]. First mentioned by [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]], who based his information on the Aegyptiaca of [[Hecataeus of Abdera]], written in the [[4th century BC]], Actisanes conquered Egypt during the reign of king Amasis. He governed Egypt with justice and benevolence, and instead of executing convicted criminals, he had their noses cut off and relocated them to a city at the desert's edge, near the border between Egypt and Syria.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Verreth |first=Herbert |title=The northern Sinai from the 7th century BC till the 7th century AD. A guide to the sources |publisher=Leuven |year=2006 |volume=1 |pages=264–271}}</ref>

=== Antiquity ===
In [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]], Rinocoroura was considered the last city of Egypt, on the border with [[Coele-Syria]]. 

During the second invasion of [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus IV]] in the spring of [[168 BC|168 BCE]], an embassy of [[Ptolemy VI Philometor|Ptolemy VI]] met him near Rinokoloura, which in about [[79 BC|79 BCE]] came under the rule of the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Judaean Kingdom]] of [[Alexander Jannaeus]], while in [[40 BC|40 BCE]], [[Herod the Great|Herod I]] sought refuge in Rinokoloura on his way to [[Pelusium]], where he received news of his brother's death.

The [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri|Oxyrhynchus papyrus]],{{clarify|date=February 2024|reason= which one?}} traditionally referred to as 'an invocation of Isis' or 'a Greek Isis litany,' is believed to have been transcribed during the reigns of [[Trajan]] or [[Hadrian]], but its composition dates back to the late [[1st century]]. This text contains numerous invocations of [[Isis]] and mentions Rinokoloura, where she is called 'all-seeing' ({{Langx|grc|παντόπτιν}}).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Verreth |first=Herbert |title=The northern Sinai from the 7th century BC till the 7th century AD. A guide to the sources |publisher=Leuven |year=2006 |volume=1 |pages=281}}</ref>

A number of funerary [[stele]]s with a repeated consolation formula "nobody is immortal" ({{Langx|grc|ούδείς άθάνατος}}) were found in and around the city.
[[File:Byzantine floor mosaic map at St. George Church Madaba P1090119.JPG|left|thumb|Rinocoroura on the [[Madaba Map]]]]
The earliest reliable Christian reference to Rinokoloura can be found in [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius's]] ''Epistula ad Serapionem'', in which Salomon was appointed as bishop of Rinokoloura, possibly in 339 AD. [[Sozomen]] also refers to Rinokoloura in the mid-5th century AD, stating that the city was a center of scholarship, with a meditation school ({{Langx|grc|φροντιστήριον}}) located in the desert north of the city, a church illuminated by oil lamps, and an episcopal dwelling where the entire clergy of the city resided and dined together.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sozomenos |title=Historia ecclesiastica |volume=6, 31}}</ref>

Hieronymus reported that in the early 5th century the inhabitants of Rinokoloura and other nearby cities spoke [[Syriac language|Syrian]]. However, as most of the epitaphs discovered in the area are written in Greek, and one is in Coptic, it is unclear which segment of the population Hieronymus was referring to.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Verreth |first=Herbert |title=The northern Sinai from the 7th century BC till the 7th century AD. A guide to the sources |publisher=Leuven |year=2006 |volume=1 |pages=293}}</ref>

According to [[John of Nikiû|John of Nikiu]], in 610 AD the army of general Bonosos passed through Rinocoroura (mentioned under the corrupted name Bikuran) on its way to [[Athribis]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Charles |first1=Robert H |title=The Chronicle of John, Bishop of Nikiu: Translated from Zotenberg's Ethiopic Text |date=1913 |pages=207}}</ref>

==== The Brook of Egypt ====
The story of [[Hesychius of Jerusalem|Hesychios of Jerusalem]] reveals the existence of a wadi near Rinokoloura. In one instance, the [[Septuagint]] (Isaiah 27:12)<ref>{{Cite book |last=Meer |first=Michaël N. van der |title=Die Septuaginta. Entstehung, Sprache, Geschichte. 3.

Sigismund |chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/8141502}}</ref> translates 'the [[brook of Egypt]],' which designates the southern border of Israel, as Rinokoloura, suggesting that the translators were perhaps aware of a similar 'brook' in the vicinity of the city. However, it appears that the association between Rinokoloura and the 'brook of Egypt' may be due more to the contemporary political border between Egypt and Syria, which had shifted further southward since the 8th century AD.

=== After the Arab Conquest ===

In the [[Middle Ages]], pilgrims misidentified the site as the [[Sukkot (place)|Sukkot]] of the [[Bible]].<ref name=":0" /> New fortifications were constructed at the original site by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1560. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the French laid siege to the fort, which fell after 11 days on February 19, 1799. 

[[Theodor Herzl]], the founder of [[Zionism]], [[proposals for a Jewish state|proposed ʻArīsh as a Jewish homeland]] since neither Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] nor Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]] supported settlement in [[History of Palestine#Ottoman period|Palestine]]. In 1903, [[Joseph Chamberlain]], the British colonial secretary, agreed to consider ʻArīsh, and Herzl commissioned the lawyer [[David Lloyd George]] a charter draft, but his application was turned down once an expedition, led by [[Leopold Kessler (Zionist)|Leopold Kessler]] had returned and submitted a detailed report to Herzl, which outlined a proposal to divert some of the Nile waters to the area for the purpose of settlement.<ref name="Jerusalem">''[[Jerusalem: The Biography]]'', page 380–381, [[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2011. {{ISBN|978-0-297-85265-0}}</ref>

During [[World War I]], the fort was destroyed by British bombers. It was later the location of the 45th Stationary Hospital which treated casualties of the  [[Sinai and Palestine campaign|Palestine campaign]]. The remains of those who died there were later moved to [[El Qantara, Egypt|Kantara]] Cemetery.

=== World Wars I and II ===
In December 1916, during [[World War I]], the [[Anzac Mounted Division]] and other British Empire units [[Battle_of_Magdhaba#Advance_to_El_Arish|captured the 'Arish area]] from Ottoman forces. In Australia, the town of [[El Arish, Queensland]] was named in memory of this action. 

El-ʻArīsh Military Cemetery, designed by [[Robert Lorimer]],<ref>Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer</ref> was built in 1919 for Commonwealth personnel who died during World War I. It is one of several commonwealth war cemeteries in the region, including [[Gaza War Cemetery |two]] in the [[Gaza Strip]]. 

A [[Royal Air Force]] airfield,{{where|date=June 2024}} known as RAF El Arish, was a base for air sea rescue and other operations, during World War II.

=== Israeli conquest 1948 to 1967 ===

ʻArīsh was briefly controlled by Israeli forces, during both the [[1948 Palestine war]] and the 1956 [[Suez War]]. On December 8, 1958, there was an air battle between Egyptian and Israeli air forces over ʻArīsh.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Abuljebain |first1=Nader |title=Important Dates in Palestinian Arab History |url=http://al-awda.org/until-return/important_dates.html |publisher=Al-Awda |access-date=11 January 2023 |location=Carlsbad, CA |date=2008}}</ref> As a result of the [[1967 Arab-Israeli War]], 'Arish was under Israeli occupation; it was returned to Egypt in 1979 after the signing of the [[Egypt–Israel peace treaty]].

==== El Arish massacre ====
