'''Sikkim''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|k|ᵻ|m}} {{respell|SIK|im}}; {{IPA-ne|ˈsikːim|lang}}) is a [[States and union territories of India|state]] in northeastern [[India]]. It borders the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] of China in the north and northeast, [[Bhutan]] in the east, [[Koshi Province]] of [[Nepal]] in the west, and [[West Bengal]] in the south. Sikkim is also close to the [[Siliguri Corridor]], which borders [[Bangladesh]]. Sikkim is the [[List of states and union territories of India by population|least populous]] and [[List of states and union territories of India by area|second-smallest]] among the Indian states.

The [[Kingdom of Sikkim]] was founded by the [[Chogyal|Namgyal dynasty]] in the 17th century. It was ruled by [[Buddhist]] priest-kings known as the [[Chogyal]]. It became a [[princely state]] of the [[British Indian Empire]] in 1890. Following Indian independence, Sikkim continued its [[protectorate]] status with the [[Dominion of India|Union of India]] after 1947 and the Republic of India after 1950. It enjoyed the highest literacy rate and per capita income among [[Himalayan states]]. In 1973, anti-royalist riots took place in front of the Chogyal's palace. In 1975, after the [[Indian Army]] took over the city of Gangtok, a [[1975 Sikkimese monarchy referendum|referendum]] was held that led to the dissolution of the monarchy and Sikkim joining India as its 22nd state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/india-china-standoff-why-is-sikkims-merger-with-india-being-questioned-by-china-4745142/|title=Why is Sikkim's merger with India being questioned by China? |date=11 July 2017 |access-date=11 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711065854/http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/india-china-standoff-why-is-sikkims-merger-with-india-being-questioned-by-china-4745142/ |archive-date=11 July 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Foundation of the monarchy ===
{{Main|Kingdom of Sikkim}}
[[File:Flag of Sikkim (1967-1975).svg|thumb|left|[[Flag of Sikkim]] during its independent monarchy.]]

According to legend, [[Khye Bumsa]], a 14th-century prince from the [[Minyak]] House in [[Kham]] in eastern [[Tibet]], received a [[divine revelation]] instructing him to travel south to seek his fortunes. A fifth-generation descendant of Khye Bumsa, [[Phuntsog Namgyal]], became the founder of Sikkim's monarchy in 1642, when he was consecrated as the first [[Chogyal]], or priest-king, of Sikkim by the three venerated [[lama]]s at [[Yuksom]].<ref>{{Cite book | title = Central Asia | year = 2005 | publisher = Area Study Centre (Central Asia), University of Peshawar. v. 41, no. 2 | pages = 50–53 }}</ref>
Phuntsog Namgyal was succeeded in 1670 by his son, [[Tensung Namgyal]], who moved the capital from Yuksom to [[Rabdentse]] (near modern [[Pelling]]). In 1700, Sikkim was invaded by the [[Bhutan]]ese with the help of the half-sister of the Chogyal, who had been denied the throne. The Bhutanese were driven away by the [[Tibetan people]], who restored the throne to the [[Chogyal]] ten years later. Between 1717 and 1733, the kingdom faced many raids by the Nepalese in the west and Bhutanese in the east, culminating with the destruction of the capital [[Rabdentse]] by the Nepalese.<ref name="StrategicSikkim1985">{{Cite book | title = Strategic Sikkim | last = Singh | first = O.

Following the beginning of [[British Raj|British rule]] in neighbouring India, Sikkim allied with Britain against their common adversary, [[Nepal]]. The Nepalese attacked Sikkim, overrunning most of the region including the [[Terai]]. This prompted the [[British East India Company]] to attack Nepal, resulting in the [[Gurkha War]] of 1814.<ref>{{Cite book | title = History of Sikkim, 1817–1904: Analysis of British Policy and Activities | last = Jha | first = Pranab Kumar | year = 1985 | publisher = O.P.S.

=== Indian protectorate ===
Prior to [[Partition of India|Indian independence]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], as the Vice-President of the Executive Council, pushed through a resolution in the [[Constituent Assembly of India|Indian Constituent Assembly]] to the effect that Sikkim and Bhutan, as Himalayan states, were not 'Indian states' and their future should be negotiated separately.{{sfn|Duff, Sikkim: Requiem for a Himalayan Kingdom|2015|p=41}} A standstill agreement was signed in February 1948.{{sfn|Duff, Sikkim: Requiem for a Himalayan Kingdom|2015|p=45}}

Meanwhile, Indian independence and its move to democracy spurred a fledgling political movement in Sikkim, giving rise to the formation of [[Sikkim State Congress]] (SSC), a pro-accession political party. The party sent a plate of demands to the palace, including a demand for accession to India. The palace attempted to defuse the movement by appointing three secretaries from the SSC to the government and sponsoring a counter-movement in the name of [[Sikkim National Party]], which opposed accession to India.{{sfn|Duff, Sikkim: Requiem for a Himalayan Kingdom|2015|pp=44–45}}

The demand for responsible government continued, and the SSC launched a civil disobedience movement. The Chogyal [[Palden Thondup Namgyal]] asked India for help in quelling the movement, which was offered in the form of a small military police force and an Indian [[Dewan]]. In 1950, a treaty was agreed between India and Sikkim which gave Sikkim the status of an Indian [[protectorate]]. Sikkim came under the [[suzerainty]] of India, which controlled its external affairs, defence, diplomacy and communications.<ref>{{citation |first=Werner |last=Levi |title=Bhutan and Sikkim: Two Buffer States |journal=The World Today |volume=15 |pages=492–500 |number=2 |date=December 1959 |jstor=40393115}}</ref> In other respects, Sikkim retained administrative autonomy.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

A state council was established in 1953 to allow for constitutional government under the Chogyal. Chogyal [[Palden Thondup Namgyal]] was able to preserve autonomy and shape a "model Asian state" where the [[literacy rate]] and [[per capita income]] were twice as high as neighbouring [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]] and India.<ref name="duPlessixGray">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/08/books/the-fairy-tale-that-turned-nightmare.html |title=The Fairy Tale That Turned Nightmare? |date=8 March 1981 |first=Francine |last=du Plessix Gray |author-link=Francine du Plessix Gray |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=3 July 2017 |postscript=; |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617055430/http://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/08/books/the-fairy-tale-that-turned-nightmare.html |archive-date=17 June 2017 |url-status=live}} and [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/08/books/the-fairy-tale-that-turned-nightmare.html?pagewanted=2 page 2] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815024722/http://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/08/books/the-fairy-tale-that-turned-nightmare.html?pagewanted=2 |date=15 August 2017 }}</ref> Meanwhile, the [[Sikkim National Congress]] demanded fresh elections and greater representation for Nepalis in Sikkim.

=== Merger and statehood ===
{{See also|1975 Sikkimese monarchy referendum}}
In [[1975 in Sikkim|1975]], the Prime Minister of Sikkim [[Kazi Lhendup Dorjee]], appealed to the Indian Prime Minister, [[Indira Gandhi]] for Sikkim to become a state of India.

=== Recent history ===
In 2000, the seventeenth [[Karmapa]], [[Karmapa controversy#Urgyen Trinley Dorje|Urgyen Trinley Dorje]], who had been confirmed by the [[Dalai Lama]] and accepted as a [[tulku]] by the Chinese government, escaped from [[Tibet (1912–1951)|Tibet]], seeking to return to the [[Rumtek Monastery]] in Sikkim. Chinese officials were in a dilemma on this issue, for any protests to India would mean an explicit endorsement of India's governance of Sikkim, which China still recognised as an independent state occupied by India. The Chinese government eventually recognised Sikkim as an Indian state in 2003, in return for India declaring [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] as a part of the territory of China;<ref>{{cite news |title=India and China agree over Tibet |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3015840.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=24 June 2003 |access-date=19 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{citation |last1=Powers |first1=John |last2=Templeman |first2=David |title=Historical Dictionary of Tibet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LVlyX6iSDEQC&pg=PA184 |year=2012 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-7984-3 |page=184}}</ref> [[New Delhi]] had accepted Tibet as part of China in 1954, but China appears to have believed that the agreement had lapsed.<ref>{{citation |chapter=China–India: Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh Plateaus |last=Pardesi |first=Manjeet |editor=Emmanuel Brunet-Jailly |title=Border Disputes: A Global Encyclopedia, 3 volumes: A Global Encyclopedia |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k9g5CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA542 |year=2015 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-61069-024-9 |pages=543–544}}: "Soon thereafter, India signed an agreement with China—on April 29, 1954—which explicitly recognized Tibet as part of China."</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Acharya |first=Alka |chapter=China |editor1=David Malone |editor2=C.

Sikkim's hot springs are renowned for their [[Hot spring#Therapeutic uses|medicinal and therapeutic value]]. Among the state's most notable hot springs are those at Phurchachu, [[Yumthang Valley|Yumthang]], Borang, Ralang, Taram-chu and Yumey Samdong. The springs, which have a high [[sulphur]] content, are located near river banks; some are known to emit [[hydrogen]].{{sfn|Choudhury|2006|p=11}} The average temperature of the water in these hot springs is {{convert|50|°C|°F}}.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hooker |first=Joseph Dalton |author-link=Joseph Dalton Hooker |title=Himalayan Journals: Notes of a Naturalist |publisher=John Murray |location=London |volume=II |year=1855 |page=125}}</ref>

===Geology===

The soil is coarse, with large concentrations of [[iron oxide]]; it ranges from neutral to [[acidic]] and is lacking in organic and mineral nutrients. This type of soil tends to support [[evergreen]] and [[deciduous forest]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bhattacharya |first=B. |title=Sikkim: Land and People |publisher=Omsons Publications |year=1997 |pages=7–10 |isbn=978-81-7117-153-8}}</ref>

The rock consists of [[phyllite]]s and schists, and is highly susceptible to weathering and erosion. This, combined with the state's heavy rainfall, causes extensive soil erosion and the loss of soil nutrients through [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]]. As a result, landslides are frequent, often isolating rural towns and villages from the major urban centres.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Terrain Analysis and Spatial Assessment of Landslide Hazards in Parts of Sikkim |title=Journal of the Geological Society of India v. 47 |year=1996 |page=491}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
The state has five seasons: winter, summer, spring, autumn, and monsoon season. Sikkim's climate ranges from [[sub-tropical]] in the south to [[tundra]] in the north. Most of the inhabited regions of Sikkim experience a [[temperate]] climate, with temperatures seldom exceeding {{convert|28|°C|°F}} in summer. The average annual temperature for most of Sikkim is around {{convert|18|°C|°F}}.{{Citation needed|date=May 2022}}

Sikkim is one of the few states in India to receive regular snowfall. The [[snow line]] ranges from {{convert|6100|m|ft}} in the south of the state to {{convert|4900|m|ft}} in the north.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Hooker | first = Joseph Dalton | author-link = Joseph Dalton Hooker | year = 1854 | title = Himalayan Journals: Notes of a Naturalist | edition = version 2 | publisher = John Murray | page = 396 }}</ref> The tundra-type region in the north is snowbound for four months every year, and the temperature drops below {{convert|0|°C|°F}} almost every night.{{sfn|Choudhury|2006|p=11}} In north-western Sikkim, the peaks are frozen year-round;{{sfn|Choudhury|2006|p=13}} because of the high altitude, temperatures in the mountains can drop to as low as {{convert|-40|°C|°F}} in winter.

During the monsoon, heavy rains increase the risk of [[landslide]]s. The record for the longest period of continuous rain in Sikkim is 11&nbsp;days. [[Fog]] affects many parts of the state during winter and the monsoons, making transportation perilous.<ref>Hooker p. 409</ref>

{{See also|1=Elections in Sikkim|2=History of Sikkim}}
[[File:Sikkim Assembly Gangtok.jpg|thumb|[[Sikkim Legislative Assembly]]]]
According to the [[Constitution of India]], Sikkim has a [[parliamentary system]] of [[representative democracy]] for its governance; [[universal suffrage]] is granted to state residents. The government structure is organised into three branches:

* Executive: As with all [[States and territories of India|states of India]], a [[governor]] stands at the head of the executive power of state, just as the president is the head of the executive power in the Union, and is appointed by the President of India. The governor's appointment is largely ceremonial, and his or her main role is to oversee the swearing-in of the [[chief minister]]. The chief minister, who holds the real executive powers, is the head of the party or coalition garnering the largest majority in the state elections. The governor also appoints cabinet ministers on the advice of the chief minister.
* Legislature: Sikkim has a [[unicameral]] legislature, the [[Sikkim Legislative Assembly]], like most other Indian states. Its state assembly has 32 seats, including one reserved for the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]. Sikkim is allocated one seat in each of the two chambers of India's national [[bicameral]] legislature, the [[Lok Sabha]] and the [[Rajya Sabha]].
* Judiciary: The [[judiciary]] consists of the [[Sikkim High Court]] and a system of lower courts. The High Court, located at Gangtok, has a Chief Justice along with two permanent justices. The Sikkim High Court is the smallest state high court in the country.<ref name="High court">{{Cite news | url = http://pib.nic.in/archieve/lreleng/lyr2003/roct2003/30102003/r301020036.html | title = Judge strengths in High Courts increased | publisher = Ministry of Law & Justice | date = 30 October 2003 | access-date = 12 October 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171022014634/http://pib.nic.in/archieve/lreleng/lyr2003/roct2003/30102003/r301020036.html | archive-date = 22 October 2017 | url-status = dead}}</ref>

In 1975, after the abrogation of Sikkim's monarchy, the [[Indian National Congress]] gained a majority in the 1977 elections. In 1979, after a period of instability, a popular ministry headed by [[Nar Bahadur Bhandari]], leader of the [[Sikkim Sangram Parishad Party]], was sworn in. Bhandari held on to power in the 1984 and 1989 elections. In the 1994 elections, [[Pawan Kumar Chamling]] of the [[Sikkim Democratic Front]] became the Chief Minister of the state.

=== Subdivisions ===
Sikkim has six districts – [[East Sikkim|Gangtok District]], [[North Sikkim|Mangan District]], [[South Sikkim|Namchi District]], [[Pakyong District]], [[West Sikkim|Geyzing District]] and [[Soreng District]]. The district capitals are [[Gangtok]], [[Mangan, India|Mangan]], [[Namchi]], [[Pakyong]], [[Gyalshing]] and [[Soreng]] respectively.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Manorama Yearbook 2009 | editor1-last = Mathew | editor1-first = K.

Soreng, Yuksom, Gyalshing and Dentam are the subdivisions of the Geyzing and Soreng district. Chungthang, Dzongu, Kabi and Mangan are the subdivisions of the Mangan district.

Each of Sikkim's districts is overseen by a state government appointee, the [[district collector]], who is in charge of the administration of the civilian areas of the district. The Indian Army has control over a large part of the state, as Sikkim forms part of a sensitive border area with [[China]]. Many areas are restricted to foreigners, and [[Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order 1958 (India)|official permits]] are needed to visit them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sikkim.nic.in/sws/tour_off.htm|title=Information of Foreign Tourist Interest|publisher=Sikkim.nic.in|access-date=6 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523095928/http://sikkim.nic.in/sws/tour_off.htm|archive-date=23 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

{{Main|Economy of Sikkim}}
Sikkim's nominal state [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) was estimated at US$4.6&nbsp;billion in 2019, with GDP per capita being $7,530 (₹ 5,50,000) thus constituting the [[List of Indian states by GDP|third-smallest GDP among India's 28 states]].<ref name="Unidow" /> The state's economy is largely [[agriculture|agrarian]] based on the terraced farming of [[rice]] and the cultivation of crops such as [[maize]], [[millet]], [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[tea]], and [[cardamom]].<ref>{{Cite book | title = City, Society and Planning: Society | last = Dutt | first = Ashok K. |author2=Baleshwar Thakur | year = 2007 | publisher = Concept Publishing | isbn = 978-81-8069-460-8 | page = 501 }}</ref>{{sfn|Bareh|2001|pp=20–21}} Sikkim produces more cardamom than any other Indian state and is home to the largest cultivated area of cardamom.<ref>{{Cite book | title = India: A Reference Annual | publisher = Research and Reference Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting | year = 2002 | location = New Delhi | page = 747 }}</ref> Sikkim achieved its ambition to convert its [[Organic agriculture|agriculture to fully organic]] between 2003 and 2016, and became the first state in India to achieve this distinction.<ref name=Strategies>Paull, John (2017) [https://www.academia.edu/35179966 "Four New Strategies to Grow the Organic Agriculture Sector"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304181540/http://www.academia.edu/35179966/Four_New_Strategies_to_Grow_the_Organic_Agriculture_Sector |date=4 March 2018 }}, Agrofor International Journal, 2(3):61–70.</ref><ref name=dna-org/><ref name=hindu-org/><ref name=tele-org/>

The Indian Army has control of a large territory, as the state is a sensitive border area. Many areas are restricted and [[Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order 1958 (India)|permits]] are needed to visit them.
