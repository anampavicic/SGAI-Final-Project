'''Richmond''' is a city in the coastal [[Lower Mainland]] region of [[British Columbia]], Canada. Mainly a suburban city, it occupies almost the entirety of [[Lulu Island]] (excluding [[Queensborough, New Westminster|Queensborough]]), between the two estuarine [[distributaries]] of the [[Fraser River]]. Encompassing the adjacent [[Sea Island (British Columbia)|Sea Island]] (where the [[Vancouver International Airport]] is located) and several other smaller [[island]]s and uninhabited [[islet]]s to its north and south, the suburb neighbours [[Vancouver]] and [[Burnaby]] on the [[Burrard Peninsula]] to the north, [[New Westminster]] and [[Annacis Island]] to the east, [[Delta, British Columbia|Delta]] to the south, and the [[Strait of Georgia]] to the west.

The indigenous [[Coast Salish]] peoples were the first people to inhabit the area of modern-day Richmond, with the [[Musqueam Indian Band|Musqueam Band]] naming the site near Terra Nova "{{lang|hur|spələkʷəqs}}" or "boiling point".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Musqueam Place Names Map |url=https://placenamemap.musqueam.bc.ca/ |access-date=29 April 2022 |website=placenamemap.musqueam.bc.ca |archive-date=28 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211128121006/https://placenamemap.musqueam.bc.ca/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Today, [[East Asian Canadians]] make up a majority of Richmond's population, along with the Continental [[Asian Canadian]] population numbering almost three-fourths of the city's population. As a member municipality of [[Metro Vancouver]], Richmond is composed of eight local neighbourhoods: Sea Island, City Centre, Thompson, West Richmond, Steveston, South Arm, East Richmond and Hamilton.<ref>{{Cite web|date=4 January 2020|title=City of Richmond Parks and Recreation- Locations|url=https://www.richmond.ca/parksrec/centres/locations.htm|access-date=7 July 2020|website=City of Richmond-|archive-date=18 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210518000605/https://www.richmond.ca/parksrec/centres/locations.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> As of 2023, the city has an estimated population of 229,781 people.<ref name="PopEstimate">{{Cite web |last=Services |first=Ministry of Citizens' |title=Population Estimates - Province of British Columbia |url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/statistics/people-population-community/population/population-estimates |access-date=2024-08-19 |website=www2.gov.bc.ca |archive-date=2024-07-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240703194926/https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/statistics/people-population-community/population/population-estimates |url-status=live }}</ref>

During the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], the [[Richmond Olympic Oval]] was a venue for [[long track speed skating]] events.

==History==
[[Coast Salish]] bands had temporary camps on the island, to fish and collect berries, which were scattered and moved from year to year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.richmond.ca/discover/about/history.htm |title=City of Richmond BC – History |publisher=Richmond.ca |access-date=21 July 2012 |archive-date=4 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201204044823/https://www.richmond.ca/discover/about/history.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Certain Coast Salish summer camps were located at Garry Point, and Woodward's Landing, along with the site of the Terra Nova cannery, which had at one time been a Musqueam village.<ref>Wayne Suttles, "Names of Places and Peoples" from Musqueam Reference Grammar (Vancouver: UBC Press, 2004), 566–76.</ref>

There is no definitive historical account as to how Richmond was named. There are several possibilities that have been proposed, including:
* The first family to settle in Richmond, that of Hugh McRoberts, had formerly lived in Australia. Their home there was called "Richmond View", and that is what they named their homestead in Richmond.
* W.D. Ferris drafted the original petition for the incorporation of The Township of Richmond. He was originally from [[Richmond, London|Richmond]], [[Surrey]], England.
* Another early settler was Hugh Boyd. He was also the first Reeve of the township. His wife had been born in [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]], [[North Yorkshire]], England.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Keen |first1=Mary |title=A bridge to the world : the life and times of Sea Island |year=2002 |publisher=City of Richmond Archives |isbn=0-9690031-5-3 |url=https://www.richmond.ca/__shared/assets/abridgetotheworld38325.pdf |access-date=11 April 2020 |archive-date=24 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210124123411/https://www.richmond.ca/__shared/assets/abridgetotheworld38325.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Township of Richmond, British Columbia was incorporated on 10 November 1879. The Township of Richmond was modeled after Ontario's political townships – an incorporated municipality, consisting of communities that are united as a single entity with a single municipal administration. Each community was represented on the municipal council through a ward electoral system with five wards until 1946 when the ward electoral system was replaced with the at large electoral system that is currently in place.

On 3 December 1990, Richmond was designated as a City.

The first Town Hall, the Agricultural Hall and the Methodist Church (now Minoru Chapel), were built at the corner of No. 17 (River) Rd and No. 20 (Cambie) Rd near the main settlement on the northwestern tip of Lulu Island at North Arm.

The old fishing village of [[Steveston, British Columbia|Steveston]] on the southwestern tip of [[Lulu Island]] is now home to several museums and heritage sites, as well as a working harbour for fishing boats. Currently, London Heritage Farm, the [[Gulf of Georgia Cannery]] and the Britannia Shipyard National Historic Site in Steveston highlight these parts of Richmond's diverse history.

==Geography==
Richmond is made up of most of the islands in the [[Fraser River]] delta, the largest and most populated island being [[Lulu Island]]. The city of Richmond includes all but a small portion of Lulu Island (the Queensborough neighbourhood at the far eastern tip is part of the city of New Westminster). The next largest island, [[Sea Island (British Columbia)|Sea Island]], is home to the [[Vancouver International Airport]] (YVR). In addition to Lulu and Sea Islands, 15 smaller islands make up the city's {{convert|128.87|km2|sqmi}} land area, including:
* [[Mitchell Island]], an industrial island accessed via the [[Knight Street Bridge]], a bridge which connects Richmond and Vancouver.
* Richmond Island, a former sand bar that has been turned into a peninsula that can only be reached from Vancouver, but technically is within Richmond's city limits. 
* Shady Island, an uninhabited island covered with trees, which can be reached over land by foot at low tide from near Steveston.

The city also includes the fishing village of Steveston, located in the far southwest corner of the city, and [[Burkeville, British Columbia|Burkeville]], which shares Sea Island with the airport. Both Steveston and Burkeville were independent villages until they were annexed by Richmond.

Since all of Richmond occupies islands in a [[river delta]], the city has plenty of rich, [[alluvial soil]] for agriculture, and was one of the first areas in British Columbia to be farmed by Europeans in the 19th century. The drawback of Richmond's geographical location was that since all the land averages just one metre above [[sea level]], it was prone to flooding, especially during [[high tide]]. As a result, all the major islands are now surrounded by a system of [[levee|dykes]], which, although not as massive as those in the [[Netherlands]] or the levees of [[New Orleans]], serve to protect the city from anticipated sources of flooding. There is a possibility that, during an [[earthquake]], the dykes could rupture, and the [[Alluvium|alluvial soil]] may [[soil liquefaction|liquefy]], causing extensive damage. Richmond is also at risk of a major flood if the [[Fraser River]] has an unusually high spring [[freshet]]. Recreational trails run along the tops of many of the dykes, and Richmond also supports about {{convert|1400|acre|km2}} of parkland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.richmond.ca/discover/about/profile.htm |title=City of Richmond Profile |publisher=Richmond.ca |date=14 December 2009 |access-date=21 July 2012 |archive-date=27 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200927014126/https://www.richmond.ca/discover/about/profile.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Because of the high [[groundwater]] table, very few houses in Richmond have [[basement]]s and until the late 1980s, very few buildings were above 3 storeys high. Also, because of proximity to the airport, current [[building code]]s limit the height of buildings to {{convert|150|ft|m}}.

===Climate===
Richmond has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Cfb]]). Because it is not as close to the mountains, it actually receives 30% less rain than neighbouring Vancouver.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.welcomebc.ca/wbc/immigration/regions/vancouver/cities/vancouver.page?#richmond |title=Vancouver: Richmond |publisher=welcomebc.ca |access-date=4 October 2010 |archive-date=7 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107092855/http://www.welcomebc.ca/wbc/immigration/regions/vancouver/cities/vancouver.page#richmond |url-status=dead }}</ref> It rarely snows in winter, and the summer temperatures are mild to warm. Richmond is also very cloudy in the cooler months.

===Shopping malls===
[[Richmond Centre (mall)|Richmond Centre]], [[Lansdowne Centre]], [[McArthurGlen Designer Outlet Vancouver Airport|McArthurGlen Vancouver]], [[Parker Place]] and [[Aberdeen Centre]] are some of the most prominent malls in Richmond. There is also Steveston Village.

The plan is anchored by the [[Canada Line]] and includes the development of nine transit-oriented village centres. The population of the area is expected to grow from about 40,000 to 120,000 residents.

According to a senior planner for the city, the goal of the plan is to "turn the middle arm of the Fraser River into a focus instead of an edge."<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/vancouver-sun/20070609/283463546884304 |title=High End Densification in Plan |work=Vancouver Sun |date=9 June 2007 |access-date=30 September 2022 |via=Press Reader |archive-date=2 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220502143108/https://www.pressreader.com/canada/vancouver-sun/20070609/283463546884304 |url-status=live }}</ref> A Richmond parks manager said that for "too long residents have felt contained by the river, seen it as being to their backs.

A possible pedestrian bridge where Cambie Road reaches the river is also being included in a future vision of the area. It would link nature trails on the north and south banks, and make Aberdeen Centre within walking distance for BCIT's aerospace campus students.<ref name="VS1"/>

==== Capstan Way ====
[[File:Richmond Apartment construction site view 201807.jpg|thumb|right|Capstan Way development in 2018]]
Developer Pinnacle International is planning a 16-building development on a {{Convert|7|ha|acre|adj=on|spell=in}} property near Capstan Way and No 3 road. The mixed-use development would include over 2,100 residential units, various commercial uses, and a hotel.

The [[Canada Line]] is considered critical to the project. A fifth Richmond station at Capstan Way (No. 3 Road and Capstan Way) was originally planned, but was cancelled in March 2009. This station was considered so critical to the development that the City of Richmond has received $19 million from developers for the station to be built.<ref>{{cite news |last=Shepert |first=Elana |date=12 December 2017 |title=CAPSTAN STATION: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT RICHMOND'S NEW SKY TRAIN STATION |url=https://604now.com/capstan-station-richmonds-sky-train-station |access-date=2 December 2019 |publisher=604 Now |archive-date=31 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331150406/https://604now.com/capstan-station-richmonds-sky-train-station/ |url-status=live }}</ref> [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]], the Canada Line operator, has started designing this station in November 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title=TransLink to start designing Canada Line's new $28-million Capstan Way Station|url=http://dailyhive.com/vancouver/capstan-way-station-canada-line-translink-richmond-2017|last=Chan|first=Kenneth|publisher=Daily Hive|date=16 November 2017|access-date=6 October 2018|archive-date=6 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181006234842/http://dailyhive.com/vancouver/capstan-way-station-canada-line-translink-richmond-2017|url-status=live}}</ref> On 2 September 2021, construction started on [[Capstan station]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Construction officially begins on Canada Line's new $52 million Capstan Station {{!}} Urbanized |url=https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/capstan-station-canada-line-skytrain-construction-groundbreaking |access-date=24 March 2022 |website=dailyhive.com |language=en |archive-date=15 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221115215249/https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/capstan-station-canada-line-skytrain-construction-groundbreaking |url-status=live }}</ref>

Also included will be 100 affordable housing units, a 25-space daycare, and a {{convert|0.6|ha|acre|adj=on}} park. The developers are also proposing live-work dwellings, where shop owners would live above their ground-level operations.

==== Aberdeen Square ====
Fairchild Developments built a six-floor expansion to its Chinese-oriented shopping centre, [[Aberdeen Centre]]. The plan includes an office building and a link to the Canada Line's [[Aberdeen station (SkyTrain)|Aberdeen station]]. The new complex was completed and opened up to the public in 2014.

==== Bridgeport Station ====
The [[River Rock Casino Resort]] is located near the Canada Line [[Bridgeport station (SkyTrain)|Bridgeport station]] and has built a 12-story hotel. The casino has added an addition above the newly added six-story car park and SkyTrain Bridgeport Station. TransLink (the Canada Line owner) gave the Great Canadian Casino Corporation land worth $9.5 million, and $4.5 million in cash in return for building the park-and-ride facility. Transit users are charged $3.00 per day to use the facility (up from an initial $2.00 charge).

==== Garden City Lands ====

The {{Convert|55.2|ha|acre|adj=on}} parcel known as the Garden City Lands was leased by the federal government for decades and was formerly used as a transmitter site for program requirements of the [[Canadian Coast Guard]].

The City of Richmond, [[Canada Lands Company]], and the Musqueam Indian Band entered a 2005 agreement with the federal government that included the intent to remove the land from the ALR for the purposes of high-density development.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.richmond.ca/__shared/assets/MOU19709.pdf |title=Memorandum of Understanding |access-date=21 July 2012 |archive-date=13 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213225356/http://www.richmond.ca/__shared/assets/MOU19709.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> In April 2008, an application to exclude the land from the [[Agricultural Land Reserve]] was made to the Agricultural Land Commission.

On 8 March 2010, Richmond City Council announced a deal had been approved whereby the city would purchase the entire parcel of land from the Musqueam Band and Canada Lands Company for $59.2 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bclocalnews.com/richmond_southdelta/richmondreview/news/86904027.html |author=Martin van den Hemel |publisher=Richmond Review |title=City to buy Garden City Lands for $60 million |access-date=11 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316222740/http://www.bclocalnews.com/richmond_southdelta/richmondreview/news/86904027.html |archive-date=16 March 2010 }}</ref>

The Musqueam band has since brought a lawsuit against the City of Richmond, claiming they sold it under duress. The lawsuit remains dormant and it is the understanding of Coun.

==Arts and culture==
On [[Canada Day]], Richmond has an annual festival in [[Steveston, British Columbia|Steveston]] called the Steveston Salmon Festival. This event includes a parade, and a huge [[barbecue]]d salmon sale in front of the Steveston Community Centre. Locally based municipal, provincial and federal politicians frequently show up at this event, usually as part of the parade and/or to hand out [[Flag of Canada|Canadian flags]].

An annual Richmond Maritime Festival has been held at the Britannia Shipyard, National Historic Site every August since 2004. It is a family event that celebrates the region's maritime heritage with live entertainment, ships, exhibits and demonstrations.

In 2002, Richmond hosted a [[tall ship]]s festival, which attracted an estimated 400,000 people to Steveston. The success of this event surpassed many expectations and caused traffic congestion in the usually quiet area.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.richmond-news.com/issues02/082202/news/082202nn2.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050123045136/http://www.richmond-news.com/issues02/082202/news/082202nn2.html|url-status=dead|title=Richmond News: "Richmond Tall Ships 2002 attracts 400,000 people"|archivedate=23 January 2005}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.richmond-news.com/issues02/082202/news/082202nn8.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050123034051/http://www.richmond-news.com/issues02/082202/news/082202nn8.html|url-status=dead|title=Richmond News: "'Holy mackerel,' tall ships festival draws huge crowd"|archivedate=23 January 2005}}</ref> There was insufficient parking in the area, which gave locals the idea of selling "parking space" by using their driveways and front yards.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://archive.richmond-news.com/issues02/082202/news/082202nn6.html |title=Richmond News: "Parking woes lead to anger and profits" |access-date=25 May 2009 |archive-date=15 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715183349/http://archive.richmond-news.com/issues02/082202/news/082202nn6.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Despite the event's popularity, there was a revenue shortfall and the city decided not to host the event again.<ref>[http://www.royalcityrecord.com/issues03/104203/news/104203nn2.html Royal City Record: "Small – but Tall – better"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517060636/http://www.royalcityrecord.com/issues03/104203/news/104203nn2.html |date=17 May 2007 }}</ref>

Many indoor and outdoor [[art exhibition]]s are hosted by Richmond Arts Coalition (RAC) throughout the year. The Richmond Arts Strategy, passed in July 2004 by the City of Richmond, includes a proposal to promote communication between arts organizations and develop the Richmond arts community. In January 2005, a Board, mission, and mandate was established. On 1 November 2005, artists, art organizations, and patrons of the arts formed the Richmond Arts Coalition. The RAC hosts Richmond arts events, connects the public to artists and events, provides artist opportunities, nominate awards, funds performers to specific events, stimulates arts projects, and advocate for arts issues, performances, education, creation, and exhibition activities.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Our History|url=https://richmondartscoalition.com/our-history/|access-date=22 July 2021|website=Richmond Arts Coalition|language=en-US|archive-date=22 July 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210722041811/https://richmondartscoalition.com/our-history/|url-status=live}}</ref>

During the summer weekends, an annual [[Richmond Night Market]] is held. Toys, clothes, cell phones, and [https://desiturka.ca/ food] are available along with live entertainment. It is very popular and is usually crowded.

Richmond also hosted the 2006 [[Gemini Awards]], which were held at [[River Rock Casino Resort|River Rock Casino]].

===The 2010 Winter Olympics===
{{main|Richmond Olympic Oval}}
For the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver, the City of Richmond constructed an 8,000-seat speed-skating oval near the No. 2 Road Bridge, just across (the middle arm of) the Fraser River from Vancouver International Airport. The final construction cost (paid for by the city, the provincial government and the federal government) is around $178 million [[Canadian dollar|CAD]]. Since the completion of the Games, the oval has served as a recreational structure for local residents.

[[File:Fountains at Richmond City Hall (29758873745).jpg|thumb|right|Richmond City Hall]]
Richmond votes regularly for conservative or centrist parties, and is a stronghold for the BC Liberal Party.

===Municipal===
Richmond's municipal council is elected using an at-large electoral system.
 
Like [[Vancouver]], but unlike most cities in [[British Columbia]], Richmond runs on a political system of locally based [[political parties]], or [[slate (elections)|slate]]s. For the most part, however, their organization is weak, and they may collapse or change names from one election to another.

Local government includes a 9-member [[city council]] and a 7-member [[Board of education|school board]]. City council consists of a mayor and 8 councillors. The current mayor of Richmond is Malcolm Brodie, who is serving his 6th term as mayor. The last elections were held in October 2018.

In the 2018 city elections, the RCA (Richmond Citizen's Association) party, the Richmond First party, and the RITE Richmond party all won 2 seats, the Richmond Community Coalition won one seat, and there is one independent. On the Richmond Board of Education, the Richmond Education Party won three seats, the Richmond First Party won two seats, and there are two independents.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.richmond.ca/cityhall/elections/2018results/results.htm?PageMode=HTML |title=2018 Election Results |publisher=Richmond.ca |date=24 October 2018 |access-date=13 April 2020 |archive-date=24 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201124043509/https://www.richmond.ca/cityhall/elections/2018results/results.htm?PageMode=HTML |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia]], Richmond was previously a stronghold of the [[BC United|BC United Party]]. In the [[2020 British Columbia general election|most recent provincial election in 2020]], the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party|BC NDP]] flipped three of Richmond's four [[electoral district]]s ([[Richmond South Centre]], [[Richmond-Queensborough]], and [[Richmond-Steveston]]).

===Federal===
In the [[House of Commons of Canada]], Richmond is divided between two [[electoral district]]s: [[Richmond Centre (federal electoral district)|Richmond Centre]], which encompasses the city's centre and west, and [[Steveston—Richmond East]], which encompasses the south and east. In the [[2021 Canadian federal election|2021 federal election]], the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] won Richmond Centre and Steveston—Richmond East.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
[[File:Richmond BC No 3 Rd 201807.jpg|thumb|The [[Canada Line]] is Richmond's [[rapid transit]] service to [[Vancouver International Airport]] and [[Downtown Vancouver]].]]
Richmond is connected by a system of bridges and tunnels to Vancouver and Delta, and through the New Westminster suburb of Queensborough (on eastern Lulu Island) to the "mainland" portion of New Westminster. Three bridges (one of them twinned) connect Lulu Island to Sea Island and the Vancouver International Airport; one bridge connects Sea Island and the Vancouver International Airport to Vancouver; two bridges connect Lulu Island to Vancouver; one bridge connects Queensborough (on eastern Lulu Island) to New Westminster; one bridge connects Queensborough to Annacis Island in Delta; one twinned bridge connects Richmond to Annacis Island; and [[George Massey Tunnel|one of the few]] [[underwater tunnel]]s in British Columbia connects Richmond to Delta.

[[File:Dinsmore Bridge aerial.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Dinsmore Bridge]] (foreground) is one of three road connections between [[Lulu Island]] (at right) and [[Sea Island (British Columbia)|Sea Island]] (at left).]]
Two freeways serve Richmond: [[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]], which connects to [[Interstate 5]] at the border with the United States, and [[British Columbia Highway 91|Highway 91]], which connects Delta, New Westminster, and Richmond.

Railway bridges connect Lulu Island to Vancouver, New Westminster, and [[Annacis Island]], and serve the [[Canadian National]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]s, as well as the Southern Railway of British Columbia (although the latter railway's Lulu Island trackage is entirely within Queensborough).

Public transportation in Richmond is provided by [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]], the regional transit authority for Metro Vancouver. The system provides bus and rail service from Richmond to Vancouver, Surrey, New Westminster, Burnaby, and Delta. The [[Canada Line]] is a [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] rail line, connecting both Richmond and the airport to [[Downtown Vancouver]] and to points in between, opened on Monday, 17 August 2009. The Canada Line provides travel to Downtown Vancouver in 25 minutes with a frequency of 3 to 12 minutes, 20 hours per day. Major transit hubs include [[Richmond–Brighouse station]], which serves as a hub for many Richmond bus routes, and [[Bridgeport station (SkyTrain)|Bridgeport station]] which serves as a hub for bus routes connecting to other municipalities. After the Canada Line closes at night, late-night service is provided by the [[List of bus routes in Metro Vancouver#NightBus|N10 Nightbus]] every day of the week. The bus runs every 30 minutes, with the exception of one northbound trip (2{{nbsp}}am{{snd}}3{{nbsp}}am), during which service is at 60 minutes; service returns to 30 minutes after the northbound trip at 3{{nbsp}}am.

===Film and television production===
[[Steveston, British Columbia|Steveston Village]] has played home to several major American movies such as ''[[Blade II]]'' and ''[[The 6th Day]]'', and television series such as ''[[The X-Files]]'', ''[[Supernatural (American TV series)|Supernatural]]'', ''[[The Secret Circle (TV series)|The Secret Circle]]'', ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', ''[[Killer Instinct (TV series)|Killer Instinct]]'', ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', the ''[[Final Destination]]'' series and the ''[[Scary Movie]]'' series. It is also the location for the fictitious town of Storybrooke in the ABC TV series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]''.

[[Fantasy Gardens]] (an old amusement park which is relocated now) served as Halloweentown in the popular [[Disney Channel]] television movie ''[[Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge]]'' and was also featured in the TV series ''Killer Instinct'' and ''Stargate SG-1''. The television series ''[[Aliens in America]]'' and ''[[Life Unexpected]]'' also made use of [[Cambie Secondary School]] in the northern part of the city.

The exterior of the Workers' Compensation Board building (now the [[WorkSafeBC]] building) was used for the hospital in [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[Kingdom Hospital]]''.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=December 2003 |editor-last=Freeman |editor-first=Donna |access-date=26 August 2023 |title=WorkSafe |url=http://www.worksafebc.com/publications/newsletters/worksafe_magazine/Assets/PDF/wsm_nov_dec_2003.pdf |url-status=dead |magazine=WorkSafe Magazine |publisher=Worker's Compensation Board of BC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206093926/http://worksafebc.com/publications/newsletters/worksafe_magazine/Assets/PDF/wsm_nov_dec_2003.pdf |archive-date=6 February 2010}}</ref> These exteriors can now be seen on the [[CBS]] series ''[[Eleventh Hour (American TV series)|Eleventh Hour]]''.

Vancouver International Airport on Richmond's Sea Island has also been featured in numerous films and television series, commonly standing in for [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport]] (as it does in ''[[Code Name: The Cleaner|The Cleaner]]'' and ''[[Dead Like Me]]''). It is also featured as stand-ins for other airports in films such as ''[[Final Destination (film)|Final Destination]]'', ''[[The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (film)|The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants]]'', ''[[The L Word]]'', ''[[The Lizzie McGuire Movie]]'', ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'' and ''[[Are We There Yet? (film)|Are We There Yet?]]''

The Aerospace Technology Campus of BCIT, located just next to [[Vancouver International Airport]], was used as a military academy mess hall for the live-action prequel series for the popular console game ''[[Halo 4]]'' in ''[[Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn]]''. In addition, many other films, such as ''[[Rise of the Planet of the Apes]]'' and ''[[This Means War (film)|This Means War]]'', were filmed there due to the directors taking a liking to the cement structure of the building, which makes for very official-looking sets.

Richmond serves as the Vancouver headquarters for the [[Fairchild Media Group]] which broadcasts Cantonese and Mandarin television channels from [[Aberdeen Centre]]. Their channels include [[Fairchild TV]], [[Fairchild TV 2]], and [[Talentvision]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fairchildtv.com/contact.php台/|title=Contact Us|website=Fairchild TV}}</ref>
