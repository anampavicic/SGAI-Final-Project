=== Early history and Portuguese domination ===
Kupang was an important port and trading post during the [[The Portuguese in Indonesia|Portuguese]] and [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch]] colonial eras. There are still ruins and remnants of the colonial presence in the city.

Representatives of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) first encountered Kupang in 1613 after having conquered the Portuguese fort on the island of [[Solor]]. At this time the area of the city was governed by a [[Raja]] of the [[Helong people|Helong tribe]], who claimed descent from the island of [[Seram Island|Ceram]] in the [[Maluku Islands|Maluku archipelago]]. Kupang occupied an ideal strategic position to exercise control over parts of Timor since it was possible to monitor shipping activities along the south coast of the island from the location. Moreover, the [[Koinino River]] provided a supply of fresh water for the city.

An agreement was reached between the VOC and the Helong tribe, but due to a lack of VOC presence in Timor, Kupang was heavily influenced by the Portuguese [[mestizo]] population of [[Flores]], the [[Topasses]], which led to the establishment of a Portuguese stronghold by the 1640s. However, by 1646, the VOC was firmly established on the nearby island of Solor and renewed their agreement with the local Raja of Kupang.<ref>Arend de Roever, ''De jacht op sandelhout: De VOC en de tweedeling van Timor in de zeventiende eeuw'' (Zutphen 2002), pp. 105-255.</ref> In January 1653, a Dutch fortification, Fort Concordia, was built on an elevated position on the left bank of the river estuary. Kupang then became the base of the Dutch struggle against the Portuguese. After a series of defeats were inflicted on the Dutch between 1655 and 1657, large groups of refugees from the neighbouring VOC allies of the [[Sonbai]] and [[Amabi]] principalities settled into the vicinity of Kupang and formed small polities on land that had traditionally belonged to the Helong. They were followed by two other groups, the Amfoan and the Taebenu, who arrived in 1683 and 1688, respectively. The Helong Raja remained the "Lord of the Land" (''tuan tanah'') but remained closely dependent on VOC authorities. However, apart from the territory of the Helong, the island of Timor was largely dominated by the Portuguese until 1749.<ref>Hans Hägerdal, ''Lords of the land, lords of the sea: Conflict and adaptation in early colonial Timor, 1600-1800'' (Leiden 2012), pp. 199-309.</ref>

=== Dutch colony ===
The Dutch established a European-modelled administration with a [[list of colonial Residents of Dutch Timor|chief executive]] (''opperhoofd'') and a council, which regulated affairs with the indigenous population through regular meetings (''vergaderingen''), and also handled affairs with the nearby VOC-allied islands of [[Rote Island|Rote]], [[Savu]], and [[Solor]]. Chinese traders and artisans were settled by the early 18th century and soon became an indispensable part of the local economy. The area of the town was also settled by various indigenous groups from the region, and by [[Mardijker people|mardijkers]] (who were the descendants of freed slaves under Dutch jurisdiction). In 1752, the population consisted of 827 Christians and an unspecified number of non-Christians.<ref>Hans Hägerdal 2012, p. 254.</ref> The political importance of Kupang increased greatly in 1749 when the Topasses were decisively defeated by the Dutch and their allies, which led to the extension of VOC influence over wide areas of western and central Timor. Nevertheless, Dutch influence on the island was somewhat diminished after 1761 due to incompetence and inaction on the part of the colonial administration.

Kupang was the final destination of [[William Bligh]], who was set adrift in an open boat following the [[Mutiny on the Bounty]] (1789). After travelling 3,618 nautical miles (6,710 km) from the Tonga Islands over 41 days, Bligh landed in Kupang on 14 June.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/15411/15411-h/15411-h.htm#ch13|title=A Voyage to the South Sea|website=gutenberg.org|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref> News of his journey inspired a small party of nine convicts and two children to escape from the penal colony at [[Sydney Cove]], Australia, they escaped from [[Port Jackson]], Australia, and arrived at Kupang after ten weeks,<ref>T. Kenealy, ''Commonwealth of Thieves'' (Random House Australia 2005), p. 353.</ref> having travelled 3,254 nautical miles (6,026 km).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/15411/15411-h/15411-h.htm#ch18|title=A Voyage to the South Sea|website=gutenberg.org|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref>

VOC positions in the [[East Indies]] were attacked by British Forces following the [[Batavian Republic|occupation of the Netherlands]] by French revolutionary armies in 1795. Kupang was assaulted in 1797, and the British were eventually expelled, although the town suffered extensive damage. Another British attack in 1811 was similarly defeated. After the [[Invasion of Java (1811)|British occupation of Java]], Kupang finally surrendered in January 1812, and the town was returned to the Dutch in 1816 following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. 

The politics of the city in the early 19th century were dominated by Jacobus Arnoldus Hazaart, who governed Dutch Timor as a ''Resident'' in three terms between 1810 and 1832 and handled matters with little interference from the colonial government in [[Jakarta|Batavia]].<ref>Steven Farram, "[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41017136_Jacobus_Arnoldus_Hazaart_and_the_British_interregnum_in_Netherlands_Timor_1812-1816 Jacobus Arnoldus Hazaart and the British interregnum in Netherlands Timor, 1812-1816]", ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'' 163-4 (2007), pp. 455-475.</ref> During his tenure, the Christian mission in the city experienced greater success than before, partially through the efforts of the missionary Reint LeBruyn (1799-1829). The town was opened to foreign trade in 1825, and fees were abolished three years later. Kupang's subsequent popularity with British and North American [[Whale hunters|whalers]] was diminished by the late 19th century after the relocation of whaling areas, although the city was a [[free port]] after 1866.<ref>Hermann Fiedler, ''Die Insel Timor'' (Friedrichssegen 1929), p. 2.</ref> In 1917, the five small kingdoms that surrounded the town area (the Helong kingdoms of Kupang, [[Sonbai Kecil]], [[Amabi]], Taebenu, and Funai) were merged into the ''zelfbesturend landschap'' (self-ruling territory) of Kupang in 1917, which, despite the name, did not include the city itself. From 1918 to 1955 Kupang was governed by the Nisnoni family, a branch of the [[Sonbai Dynasty]].<ref>L.J. van Dijk, "De zelfbesturende landschappen in de Residentie Timor en Onderhoorigheden", ''Indische Gids'' 47 (1925).</ref>

=== Recent history and independence ===
The city was used for landing and refueling by long-distance flights between Europe and Australia. It was under [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese occupation]] between 1942 and 1945, and much of the Old Town was destroyed by Allied bombing. The city saw significant nationalist agitation but remained otherwise peaceful during the period of the [[Indonesian revolution]] (1945-1949). Kupang was later part of the [[State of East Indonesia]] and was established by the Dutch authorities in 1946, and the area of the city was included in the ''zelfbesturend landschap'' of Kupang. The city, along with the state of East Indonesia was later annexed into the [[United States of Indonesia]] in 1949, which was replaced by the current [[Indonesia|Republic of Indonesia]] in 1950.

The city later became an important location in the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|Timorese conflict]]. In 1967, the city became the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kupang|Diocese of Kupang]]. In 1989, the [[diocese]] was elevated to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kupang|Archdiocese of Kupang]].<ref>Steven Farram, ''[https://researchers.cdu.edu.au/en/studentTheses/from-timor-koepang-to-timor-ntt From 'Timor Koepang' to 'Timor NTT': The political history of West Timor, 1901-1967]'' (PhD Thesis, Charles Darwin University 2004).</ref> In April 2021, the city was heavily damaged by Tropical [[Cyclone Seroja]].<ref>Bere, Sigiranus Marutho. 2021. ''[https://regional.kompas.com/read/2021/04/05/134009578/diterjang-badai-siklon-tropis-seroja-selama-9-jam-sejumlah-bangunan-di-kota?page=all Nine consecutive hours of nonstop rainfall and wind gust in Kupang due to Severe Tropical Cyclone Seroja]''</ref>

== Geography ==
Kupang is located on the southwestern tip of the island of Timor. It is solely bordered by the [[Kupang Regency]] on land and on its northern shore by the [[Savu Sea]]. It has a land area of 180.27 square kilometers (which is divided into six administrative districts), along with a water area of 94.79 square kilometers. The area around the city is geologically inactive, with soil composition characterised by non-volcanic materials such as [[Latosol]] and [[Terra rossa (soil)|Terra rossa]]. At its highest point, the city is 62 metres above sea level, with inclination varying from 0 - 5%.<ref name=":0" /> The topography of the city is mostly low-lying but also includes groups of hills in the south and southwest, which has the effect of creating a relatively fertile [[Drainage basin|catchment area]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Profil Kota Kupang (PU)|url=https://sippa.ciptakarya.pu.go.id/sippa_online/ws_file/dokumen/rpi2jm/DOCRPIJM_dc4010330a_BAB%20IVBab%204%20PROFIL.pdf}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Kota Kupang Dalam Angka 2021|url=https://kupangkota.bps.go.id/publication/2021/02/26/2de8cd41b21b588c342004b9/kota-kupang-dalam-angka-2021.html|access-date=2021-04-23|website=kupangkota.bps.go.id}}</ref>

==Demographics==
Because of its status as a provincial capital, Kupang has become a multi-ethnic city and is a popular destination for migration from neighbouring regions. The city's population increased by 31% from 2010 to 2020. In that year, the ratio of males to females in the city was 51 to 50. As with most Indonesian cities, the population is young, with 65% of the city's population classified in the potential productive workforce of people over 15 years of age. The predominant age group is in the range of 20 to 24 years old, which can be attributed to an influx of young migrant, which fell to 1.83s from other regions. The population growth in 2020 was approximately 3%, which fell to 1.83% per annum on average between 2020 and 2023. 

The majority of the city's population identifies as Protestant (326,229). Smaller religious groups include Catholic (75,804), Muslim (44,419), [[Balinese Hinduism|Hindu]] (6,114), and Buddhist (205). [[Life expectancy]] in the city is 70 years, which, although slightly below the national level, is higher than the provincial figure.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Statistik Daerah BPS Kota Kupang|url=https://kupangkota.bps.go.id/publication/2020/12/28/0257d81b6932c514368841bc/statistik-daerah--kota-kupang-2020.html|access-date=2021-04-23|website=kupangkota.bps.go.id}}</ref>

== Economy ==
[[File:Night at Kupang city.jpg|thumb|Kupang city at night]]
The largest contributor to the local economy is the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service sector]], which provides 48.29% of the city's [[gross regional product]] and provides employment for 79.34% of the city's workforce. Meanwhile, the [[Primary sector of the economy|primary sector]] (which comprises agriculture and mining) only provides 2.33% of the city's gross regional product. Other significant economic areas include construction (16.29%), transportation (9.42%), finance and insurance (7.38%), and real estate (3.03%).

This economic profile significantly differs from that of neighbouring regions, which still rely on agriculture and resource extraction as the primary contributor to their economies. The amount of land used for agriculture in Kupang decreased by 41% from 2018 to 2019, while the industrial sector grew by 11% in the same timeframe. Industrial facilities in the city include three [[Cement plant|cement plants]] operated by [[PT Semen Kupang]], which, in total, produce approximately 250,000 tons per year. This figure, however, has been deemed insufficient by the local government, because the combined yearly cement needs for the province and the neighbouring country of East Timor exceed 1.8 million tons per year. This gave rise to a plan by the provincial government to [[Nationalization|take over ownership]] of PT Semen Kupang in 2020 to increase production.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite web |last=Jahang |first=Benediktus Sridin Sulu |date=2020-02-29 |editor-last=Suyanto |editor-first=Budi |title=Pemda NTT segera ambil alih PT Semen Kupang |url=https://www.antaranews.com/berita/1327290/pemda-ntt-segera-ambil-alih-pt-semen-kupang |access-date=2021-04-24 |website=Antara News}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=PT Semen Kupang|url=http://www.ptsemenkupang.co.id/profil.html|access-date=2021-04-24|website=www.ptsemenkupang.co.id}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Wibowo |first=Ageng |date=2015-07-25 |editor-last=Sari |editor-first=Heppy Ratna |title=Presiden tinjau pabrik Semen Kupang |url=https://www.antaranews.com/berita/508643/presiden-tinjau-pabrik-semen-kupang |access-date=2021-04-24 |website=Antara News}}</ref>

The city experienced [[deflation]] with an annual rate of 0.5% in 2019. The city experiences average annual [[inflation]] figures that are slightly below the national average. As of 2018, there were 31 banks in the city, with credit percentage increases of 53% in the same year, which contributed to the rapid growth of the city's financial sector. In addition, there were 4,534 trade companies registered in the city. The city experienced high economic growth, with a figure of 10% in 2019, which was significantly above the national level. In that year, the [[Unemployment Rate|unemployment rate]] was 9.78%.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":0" />

==Governance==
=== Administrative division ===
As of 2021, Kupang was divided into six districts (''kecamatan''). The table below shows the area and population of each district according to the [[2020 Indonesian census|2020 Census]]<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> and the official estimates as of mid-2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Kupang Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.5371)</ref> It also includes the locations of the district administrative centres, the number of [[administrative village]]s (all classed as urban ''kelurahan'') in each district, and its postcodes.
