'''Taitung City''' ({{Lang-zh|p=Táidōng Shì|poj=Tâi-tang-chhī|t=臺東市}}) is a [[county-administered city]] and the [[county seat]] of [[Taitung County]], [[Taiwan]]. It lies on the southeast coast of [[Taiwan]] facing the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Taitung City is the most populous subdivision of Taitung County and it is one of the major cities on the east coast of the island.

Taitung City is served by [[Taitung Airport]].  Taitung is a gateway to [[Green Island (Taiwan)|Green Island]] and [[Orchid Island]], both of which are popular tourist destinations.

==History==
[[File:Map of Taitō-gai.jpg|thumb|Taitung City under Japanese rule]]
Before the 16th century the Taitung plain was settled by agriculturalist [[Puyuma people|Puyuma]] and [[Amis people|Amis]] [[Taiwanese aborigines|aboriginal]] tribes. Under [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch rule]] and during [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Qing rule]], a large part of eastern Taiwan, including today's Taitung, was called "Pi-lam" ({{zh|c=卑南|poj=Pi-lâm}}). Many artifacts of the prehistory sites of the city are located at [[Beinan Cultural Park]], which was discovered in 1980 during the construction of [[Taitung railway station|Taitung Station]].

In the late 19th century, when [[Liu Mingchuan]] was the Qing Governor of Taiwan, [[Han Chinese]] settlers moved into the Taitung region. Pi-lam Subprefecture ([[:zh:卑南廳|卑南廳]]) was established in 1875, and was upgraded and renamed to [[Taitung Prefecture]] in 1888, after the island was made [[Taiwan Province (Qing)|Fujian-Taiwan Province]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Davidson|first1=James W.|author-link=James W.

===Japanese rule===
[[File:Txu-pclmaps-oclc-6550512-taito-2315-iii.jpg|left|thumb|Map of Taitung (labeled as TAITŌ) and surrounding area (1944)]]
During [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], the central settlement was called {{nihongo|Nankyō Village|南鄉新街}}. {{nihongo4||臺東廳|Taitō Chō}} was one of twenty local administrative offices established in 1901. English-language works from the era refer to the place as ''Pinan'' (from Japanese) and ''Pilam'' (from [[Hokkien]]).{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|loc=Index p.29 |ps=: "Pinan (Pilam)"}} Taitō Town was established in 1920 under [[Taitō Prefecture]], and included modern Taitung City and eastern [[Beinan, Taitung|Beinan Township]]. There were no Americans living here during the Japanese rule.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Post-war===

After [[History of Taiwan since 1945|handover of Taiwan from Japan]] to the ROC in 1945, it became '''Taitung [[Township (Taiwan)|Township]]''' and in 1948 it was promoted to '''Taitung City'''.

==City government==
Taitung City government is headquartered at Taitung City Hall which takes the responsibility for the city general administration and all of its other affairs, from folk, education, cultural popularization, negotiation, emergency help, disaster prevention, environmental taxation, cleaning control, finance, public property control, tellership, taxing help, farming and fishing control, wholesale products, marketing and business administration, urban planning, public establishment, tourism, community development, army service administration, welfare, national health insurance program and indigenous administration affairs.

==Climate==
Taitung has a [[tropical monsoon climate]], with a wet season from May to October, a dry season from November to April, and consistently very warm to hot temperatures with high humidity. Unlike most tropical climates, however, the dry season is foggy rather than sunny, so that moisture availability during this period is greater than the low rainfall and warm temperatures would suggest. The highest record of temperature of Taiwan was recorded in Taitung on May 9, 2004, with temperatures peaking above 40 degrees Celsius for the first time in Taiwan's recorded history.
