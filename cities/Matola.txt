==Etymology==
Matola, which is also a common family name, comes from ''Matsolo'' a [[Ronga]] kingdom that existed in this region when the colonists arrived.

== Industry ==
Matola is an industrial centre with an important port for [[mineral]]s ([[chromium]] and [[iron]]) and other exports from [[Eswatini]] and [[South Africa]]. It has [[petroleum]] refineries (presently inactive) and diverse industries, which manufacture products like [[soap]], [[cement]], and [[agricultural]] materials. The most important of these is an [[aluminium]] smelter, installed in 2002, that more than doubled Mozambique's [[GDP]]. In November 2014, [[South Korea]]n car company [[Hyundai Motor Company]] opened a plant in Matola (Somyoung Motors), which manufactures the [[Hyundai i10]] and [[Hyundai Accent]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macauhub.com.mo/en/2014/11/07/partnership-between-mozambique-and-south-korea-assembles-hyundai-cars/ |title=Partnership between Mozambique and South Korea Assembles Hyundai Cars |publisher=MacauHub |date=2014-11-07 |access-date=2015-01-04}}</ref>

== Transport ==
[[File:The most famous loving public transport of Mozambique 2020.jpg|thumb|left|Popular public transport in Matola.]]
