==History==
The area around Zama has been settled since prehistoric times, and [[Jōmon period]] remains have been found. The hamlet of "Izama" was a [[shukuba|post station]] on the ancient [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tōkaidō]] road connecting [[Kyoto]] with the provinces in the [[Kantō region]], and the area was part of the ''[[tenryō]]'' territory within [[Sagami Province]] during the [[Edo period]] administered directly by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] through a number of ''[[hatamoto]]-''class administrators. During the cadastral reforms after the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1889, the area of present-day Zama consisted of five hamlets in [[Kōza District, Kanagawa|Kōza District]], Kanagawa Prefecture.

The area remained very rural until the coming of the [[Odakyu Electric Railway]] in 1927 and the [[Sagami Railway]] in 1935, which spurred development, but the area was mostly farmland when the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]] was relocated to the Zama area in 1937. The increase in population led Zama Village to be promoted to Zama town the same year. However, in 1941, Zama Town and surrounding villages were merged into [[Sagamihara, Kanagawa|Sagamihara]]. In 1944, the Kōza Naval Arsenal of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] was established in the area. It was closed with the end of [[World War II]], and the Imperial Japanese Army Academy was turned over to the [[United States Army]] to become [[Camp Zama]].

In September 1948, Zama regained its status as a town independent of Sagamihara. The local economy received a significant boost with the building of a [[Nissan]] automobile assembly plant in Zama in 1965, along with other industries. Zama became a [[Cities of Japan|city]] on November 1, 1971.

==Government==
Zama has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 22 members. Zama contributes one member to the Kanagawa Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Kanagawa 13th district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
After the Meiji era, mulberry fields and the raw silk industry dominated the local economy. Zama became heavily industrialized from the 1930s with production of equipment for the Japanese military, and this was followed in the 1950 and 1960s with automobile related production. However, with the economic recession in the 1990s Nissan production ended in 1995, and the economy of Zama suffered accordingly. The city has increasingly become a [[commuter town]] for nearby Sagamihara, Yokohama and Tokyo.
* Agriculture: 413 people (0.6%)
* Manufacturing: 18,978 people (29.8%)
* Service: 43,298 people (68.0%)
