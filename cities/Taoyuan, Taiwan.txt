'''Taoyuan'''{{efn native lang|tw|name=word1}} ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|t|aʊ|juː|ˈ|ɛ|n}}) is a [[special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipality]] located in northwestern [[Taiwan]], neighboring [[New Taipei City]] to the north-east, [[Yilan County, Taiwan|Yilan County]] to the south-east, and [[Hsinchu County]] to the south-west. [[Taoyuan District]] is the seat of the municipal government and which, along with [[Zhongli District]], forms a large [[Taoyuan–Zhongli metropolitan area|metropolitan area]]. Taoyuan developed from a [[satellite city]] of [[Taipei metropolitan area]] to become the [[List of metropolitan areas in Taiwan|fourth-largest metropolitan area]], and fifth-largest populated city in Taiwan. "Taoyuan" literally means "peach garden" in Chinese, since the area used to have many peach trees. Formerly [[Counties of Taiwan|a county]], Taoyuan became the latest new founding special municipality in 2014.

Taoyuan City is home to many [[industrial parks]] and tech company headquarters. Due to the city's proximity to [[Taipei]], and the lower [[cost of living]], Taoyuan has had the fastest population growth of any city in Taiwan in recent decades.<ref>{{cite news|author=Yu Hsiang, Frances Huang|title=Taoyuan sees largest population growth among 6 municipalities in 2020|url=https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202101230008|access-date=17 March 2021|work=Focus Taiwan|date=23 January 2021|archive-date=25 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210125160755/https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202101230008|url-status=live}}</ref> The city is also home to 116,000 [[foreign workers]], with many coming from [[Southeast Asia]] and working in factories or as [[migrant domestic workers|household caregivers]].<ref>{{cite news|author= Syrena Lin|title=Between Miaoli and Taoyuan: Taiwan's Response to Migrant Worker Rights at an Intersection|url=https://international.thenewslens.com/article/153596 |date=13 July 2021|access-date=24 April 2022|publisher=The News Lens|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210714054115/https://international.thenewslens.com/article/153596|archive-date=14 July 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Taiwan Today|title=Taoyuan wins international award for migrant worker program|url=https://nspp.mofa.gov.tw/nsppe/news.php?post=146296&unit=400&unitname=&postname=Taoyuan-wins-international-award-for-migrant-worker-program|date=30 November 2018|access-date=24 April 2022|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Taiwan)]]|archive-date=2 October 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221002105216/https://nspp.mofa.gov.tw/nsppe/news.php?post=146296&unit=400&unitname=&postname=Taoyuan-wins-international-award-for-migrant-worker-program|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Taoyuan International Airport]], which serves the capital, [[Taipei]] and the rest of northern Taiwan, is located in this city.

==History==

===Early history===
In ancient times, the Taoyuan plateau was the home of the [[Taiwanese plains aborigines]]. In prehistory, the [[Ketagalan people]] settled in ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Nankan, Taoyuan|zh|3=南崁|lt=Nankan}}''. In the early years of [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch colonization]], [[Spanish Formosa|Spanish colonization]], and [[Zheng He]] of the [[Ming Dynasty]], there were no large-scale cultivation or industrial activities. During the [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Qing era]], a number of people from [[Fujian Province]] and [[Guangdong province]] began to immigrate into present-day Taoyuan to develop and farm the land. They planted peach trees, which, when fully bloomed in spring, were so beautiful that the people named the land ''Toahong'' ({{zh|c=桃仔園|p=Táozǐyuán|poj=Thô-á-hn̂g|l=peach orchard}}).

===Empire of Japan===
[[File:Taoyuan Eki.jpg|thumb|[[Taoyuan railway station|Taoyuan Station]] during Japanese rule]]
In November 1901, [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|during Japanese era]], a local administrative office, {{nihongo||桃仔園廳|Toshien Chō|lead=yes}}, was established in the area, and renamed {{nihongo4||桃園廳|Tōen Chō}} in 1905. In 1920, the ''Tōen'' area was incorporated into [[Shinchiku Prefecture]].

During the Japanese era, the staged migration policy caused Taoyuan to develop into a city with a variety of cultures. For example, temples and worship paths (currently the [[Taoyuan Martyrs Shrine]]) symbolized cultural systems. {{nihongo4||武德殿|Butokuden}} were used to represent military systems, and the old Taoyuan City Office signified political systems.

===Republic of China===
After the transfer from Japan to the Republic of China, the present day-area of Taoyuan City was incorporated under [[Hsinchu County]]. In 1950, [[Taoyuan County, Taiwan|Taoyuan County]] was established by separating it from Hsinchu County. On 21 April 1971, [[Taoyuan District|Taoyuan City]] was made the county seat of Taoyuan County. It had 6 [[County-administered city|cities]], 1 [[Urban area|urban]] [[Township (Taiwan)|township]] and 6 [[rural]] townships.

In June 2009, the [[Executive Yuan]] approved the plan to upgrade Taoyuan from a county to a special municipality.<ref>{{cite news|date=1 February 2011|url=https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&post=6187|title=Rezoning Taiwan|publisher=Taiwan Today|access-date=9 December 2020|archive-date=12 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210112165942/https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&post=6187|url-status=live}}</ref> On 25 December 2014, Taoyuan County was upgraded into a [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipality]] of '''Taoyuan City''' ({{lang|zh-hant|桃園市}}).

==Geography==
Taoyuan is located approximately {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Taipei]], in northern Taiwan, and occupies {{convert|1220|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. It is made up of low-lying plains, interconnected mountains and [[Taoyuan Plateau|plateaus]]. Its shape has a long and narrow southeast-to-northwest trend, with the southeast in the [[Xueshan Range]] and the far end on the shores of the [[Taiwan Strait]].

There are many irrigation ponds at [[Taoyuan Plateau]], which caused Taoyuan to earn the nickname "Thousand-pond Township" ({{lang|zh-hant|千塘之鄉}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://doie.coa.gov.tw/story/story-detail.asp?story_id=16|script-title=zh:農田水利入口網|work=coa.gov.tw|access-date=29 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105021348/http://doie.coa.gov.tw/story/story-detail.asp?story_id=16|archive-date=5 January 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Climate===
Taoyuan has a [[humid subtropical climate]], with mild to warm winters and hot summers, typical of northern Taiwan.

{{Further|North-South divide in Taiwan#Population}}

===Han Chinese===

====Hoklo====
As of most of the cities and urban towns of Taiwan, [[Minnan people]] (Hoklos) are one of the largest ethnic groups of Taoyuan, most of whom live in northern Taoyuan (北桃園) which comprises the northern districts of Taoyuan, including Taoyuan city centre, [[Bade District|Bade]], [[Daxi District|Daxi]], [[Dayuan District|Dayuan]], [[Guishan District|Guishan]] and [[Luzhu District, Taoyuan|Luzhu]], and the city seat of government, [[Taoyuan District]] citycentre.

====Hakka====
The [[Hakka people|Hakka]] are the second-largest ethnic group in the city after the Minnan ethnicity (Hoklo) who won against the Hakkas in clan wars moved to the poor mountainous regions in southern Taoyuan, most of the Hakka peasants live in the rural peasant village areas of southern Taoyuan (南桃園), which includes [[Zhongli District|Zhongli]], [[Pingzhen District|Pingzhen]], [[Yangmei District|Yangmei]], [[Longtan District, Taoyuan|Longtan]], [[Guanyin District|Guanyin]] and [[Xinwu District, Taoyuan|Xinwu]] districts. With more than 785,000 Hakka people, Taoyuan hosts the largest Hakka population among all of Taiwan's administrative divisions.

====Waishengren====
After the [[Chinese Civil War]], many people from mainland China (unaffectionately referred to as "[[Waishengren]]") settled in the then-[[Taoyuan County]] after the retreat of the [[nationalist government]] in 1949. Most of them live in [[military dependents' village]]s in Zhongli, Pingzhen and Guishan. [[:zh:龍岡|Longgang]] is well known for its immigrants from [[Yunnan]], featuring many Yunnan-style restaurants.

===Indigenous peoples===
Most [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples]] in the city live in [[Fuxing District, Taoyuan|Fuxing District]], with most of them belonging to the [[Atayal people]]. Outside  of the [[Fuxing District, Taoyuan|Fuxing  District]], Taoyuan is the one Special Municipality of Taiwan that has no Aboriginal populations, appearing on related maps as empty.{{citation needed|date=August 2024}}

==Economy==
Taoyuan is one of the Taiwan's top industrial and technological cities. High-tech companies including [[Quanta Computer|Quanta]], [[MiTAC]], [[Inotera]], [[Nanya Technology]], [[HTC]], [[Chunghwa Picture Tubes|CPT]] and [[AU Optronics]] have all opted to build or expand their factories in Taoyuan. Taoyuan has now become a bastion of electronics and [[semiconductor]] manufacturing. Over 200 of Taiwan's top 500 manufacturing companies have factories in Taoyuan. Taoyuan has also led Taiwan in terms of industrial output for nine straight years.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

There are now 29 (registered) industrial areas with {{convert|3696|ha|acre|abbr=on}} of non-urban industrial land and {{convert|3131|ha|abbr=on}} of urban industrial land. There are over {{convert|6827|ha|acre|abbr=on}} of land available for factories and industrial use in the city, representing the fact that Taoyuan's development bureau is based on industry and commerce.
