==History==

=== Etymology ===
Samundri was on a major trade route during the reign of [[Sher Shah Suri]]. The present site of Samundri city was founded in 1887 as [[Chak (village)|Chak]] No. 533 G.B. Later it was renamed as ''Seh Mundri'' because of three Hindu [[Hindu temple|mandirs]] in the area. The word ''Seh'' ({{lang|fa|سه}}) means ''Three'' in [[Persian language|Persian]] and ''Mandir'' is a [[Sanskrit]] word for temple.

=== Modern ===
In 1887, there were three Hindu shrines in this area but now what remains, houses the Government Primary School No 4. Migration between India and Pakistan was continuous before the [[Partition of India|independence]]. By the 1930s [[West Punjab|Western Punjab]] was predominantly [[Muslim]] and supported the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and [[Pakistan Movement]]. After the independence in August 1947, the minority [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s migrated to India while the [[Muslim]] refugees from [[East Punjab|Eastern Punjab]] in India settled in Western Punjab and across Pakistan.<ref>Dube, I. &. S. (2009). From Ancient to Modern: Religion, Power, and Community in India (Hardcover). [[Oxford University Press]].</ref> Today Samundri is known for its contributions to Pakistan's [[Kabaddi]] team providing dozens of big names especially from Chak 176 G.B and 478 G.B. It has many [[Gujjar]], [[Rajput]] and [[Jat people|Jat]] farmers who tend to be physically strong and larger in constitution than elsewhere in the region.<ref>[https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V22_032.gif Samthar State - Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 22, p. 26]. ''[[Digital South Asia Library]]''. Retrieved 14 April 2021. </ref><ref name="Dawn" />

==Geography==
Samundri is located at 31°03'45"N 72°57'15"E (31.063, 72.954), at an altitude of 168 metres (429&nbsp;ft), and is 45&nbsp;km from [[Faisalabad]], 66&nbsp;km from [[Jhang]], 30&nbsp;km from [[Gojra]], 46 km from [[Sahiwal]] and just 15&nbsp;km from [[Tandlianwala]].

Then it will be easily accessible from Lahore and Multan. The Post Code of [[Samundari]] is 37300.

==Economy==
Samundri is home to a major [[Cereal|grain]], whole corn & sugar market. Sugarcane and wheat are the major crops of the area, while corn is the most-traded good locally. Rice is also grown here but, due to water shortages, fewer farmers opt to grow it. Vegetables are grown on many hectares, fulfilling 50% of the demand.

The Anarkali Bazaar is the main commercial market of the city, and the Jinnah Market is the oldest. Other markets in the city include Jamat Ali Bazaar, Katchery Bazaar, Mandi Bazaar, Nehar Bazaar, Qasim Bazaar, Kashmiri Bazaar, Sunny Plaza and Chaki Bazaar.

Samundri is also known for its custom truck painting business.
