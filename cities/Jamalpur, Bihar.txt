==Industry and culture==

===Locomotive workshop===
The [[Jamalpur Locomotive Workshop]] was the first full-fledged railway workshop facility in India, founded on {{date2|8|Feb|1862}} by the [[East Indian Railway Company]]. The Jamalpur site was chosen for its proximity both to the [[Sahibganj]] loop, which was the main trunk route at the time and to the communities of gunsmiths and other mechanical craftsmen in [[Bihar]].

The workshop was initially for repairing locomotives and assembling new ones from salvaged parts. By the early 20th century, however, it had progressed to producing its own locomotives. It produced the first one, ''CA 764 "Lady Curzon"'', in 1899. In 1893, it became the site of the first railway [[foundry]] in India. It also had a workshop for repairing and building boilers. Today it has foundry, [[metallurgy|metallurgical]] lab facilities, and machine tool facilities. Its [[rolling mill]] and [[nut (hardware)|nut]] and [[bolt (hardware)|bolt]] shop ceased operation in 1984.

The school attached to the workshop eventually became the [[Indian Railways Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering]] (IRIMEE).

=== Ananda Marga ===
The [[Ananda Marga]] movement was founded in Jamalpur by native [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]] in 1955.<ref>{{cite book |title=Anandamurti: The Jamalpur Years |last= Acosta |first=Devashish Donald |date=1 October 2010 |publisher=Innerworld Publications  |isbn=978-1881717102 }}</ref>
