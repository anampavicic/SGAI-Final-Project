==History==
{{section-stub|date=November 2024}}
In ancient times Yichang was known as Yiling. In 278 BC, during the [[Warring States period]], the [[Qin (state)|Qin]] general [[Bai Qi]] set fire to Yiling.<ref>{{Cite web |date=26 September 2022 |title=Gorgeous Yichang |url=http://www.gorgeousyichang.com/content-63114-32-1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240515063918/http://www.gorgeousyichang.com/content-63114-32-1.html |archive-date=15 May 2024 |access-date=2024-05-15 |website=www.gorgeousyichang.com}}</ref> In 222 AD, Yichang was also the site of the [[Battle of Yiling]] during the [[Three Kingdoms]] Period.<ref>{{Cite web |date=13 April 2024 |title=夷陵之战古战场遗迹 - 兵道网{{!}}山东孙子研究会{{!}}官网 |url=https://www.sunzistudies.com/m_shownews.asp?id=811 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240731105108/https://www.sunzistudies.com/m_shownews.asp?id=811 |archive-date=31 July 2024 |access-date=2024-07-31 |website=www.sunzistudies.com}}</ref>

Under the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] [[Guangxu Emperor]], Yichang [[Treaty ports|was opened to foreign commerce]] as a trading port after the [[Qing]] and [[Great Britain]] agreed to the [[Chefoo Convention]], which was signed by [[Sir Thomas Wade]] and [[Li Hongzhang]] in [[Yantai|Chefoo]] on 21 August 1876.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Yichang Government |first1= |title=History of Yichang |url= http://www.yichang.gov.cn/content-4281-1004064-1.html | publisher=Yichang Government}}</ref> The imperial government set up a navigation company there and began building facilities. Since 1949, more than 50 wharves, with a total combined length of over {{convert|15|km|sp=us}}, have been constructed at the port.{{citation needed|date=January 2024}}

During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Yichang was a primary supply depot for the defending Chinese army. In October 1938, as the Japanese moved up the [[Yangtze River]] towards the strategic city of [[Chongqing]], it became clear that Yichang needed to be evacuated. In 40 days, under the direction of businessman Lu Zuofu, more than 100,000 tons of equipment and 30,000 personnel were transported upstream by steamship or by porters pulling smaller vessels through the Three Gorges rapids to Chongqing.<ref>'Yichang Evacuation Monument'; http://easternjourney.com/2009/10/yichang-evacuation-monument/ retvd 12 7 17</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://military.china.com/history4/62/20150415/19527270_all.html |script-title=zh:抗战中的宜昌大撤退：保留中国抗战工业命脉的壮举 |date=15 April 2015}}</ref>

In 1940, the [[Battle of Zaoyang-Yichang]] took place in the area.

==Geography==
Like most prefecture-level cities, Yichang includes both an urban area (which is labeled on less detailed maps as "Yichang") and the surrounding country area. It covers {{convert|21,084|km2|sp=us}} in Western Hubei Province, on both sides of the [[Yangtze River]]. The [[Xiling Gorge]], the easternmost of the [[Three Gorges]] on the Yangtze, is located within the prefecture-level city.

Within the prefecture-level city of Yichang, the Yangtze is joined by a number of tributaries, including the [[Qing River]] (right), Xiang Xi and [[Huangbo River|Huangbo]] Rivers (left).

The central urban area of Yichang is split between several districts. On the north bank of the Yangtze, there are [[Xiling District]] (the central part of the city), Yiling District, and Wujiagang District, and Xiaoting District. The urban area on the opposite (south) bank of the river is Dianjun District. All these districts, except the central Xiling District, also include a fair amount of suburban/rural area outside of the urban zone.

===Climate===
Yichang has a four-season, [[monsoon]]-influenced, [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cwa''), with cool, damp and generally overcast winters, and hot, humid summers. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from {{convert|5.0|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|27.7|°C|1}} in July, while the annual mean is {{convert|17.08|°C|1}}. Close to 70% of the annual precipitation of {{convert|1160|mm|in|abbr=on}} occurs from May to September. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 24% in January to 49% in August, the city receives 1,568 hours of bright sunshine annually, and summer is the sunniest season.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

* [[China National Highway 318]] runs east–west through most of the prefecture-level city, south of the center city
* [[China National Highway 209]] passes through the northwestern corner of the prefecture-level city ([[Xingshan County]])
Several provincial highways connect Yichang center city with most counties.

[[Yangtze River bridges and tunnels|Several bridges span the Yangtze River]] within the prefecture-level city of Yichang, including (upstream to downstream):
* [[Xiling Bridge]], connecting [[Letianxi]] and [[Sandouping]] in [[Yiling District]], a few km downstream from the [[Three Gorges Dam]].

===Waterways===
[[File:3 gorges dam at night.JPG|thumb|The [[Three Gorges Dam]] is located near [[Sandouping]] and [[Maoping, Hubei|Maoping]] within Yichang prefecture-level city (some {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=on}} from Yichang central city)]]

Yichang has long been a major transit port and distribution center of goods, and serves as the economic hub of western Hubei province and an intermediary between the major cities of [[Chongqing]] and Wuhan. Its primary industries are shipping and shipbuilding, taking advantage of its location on the Yangtze River. The [[Qing River]] in the southern part of the prefectures, with its cascade of dams, is an important waterway. [[Maoping, Hubei|Maoping]] Town (the county seat of [[Zigui County]]), has an active passenger [[wharf]] as well.

===Railway===
Yichang is served by several railway lines.

[[Yichang Railway Station]], located in downtown Yichang, opened in 1971, was the city's first railway station. In 2012 it closed for a renovation project.<ref name=yichangZhan1>{{cite web |url=http://news.huochepiao.com/2012-10/201210917011437.htm |script-title=zh:3个月后宜昌火车站可进出动车 低站台改造成高站台 |website=huochepiao.com |date=October 2012}}</ref>

The [[Yichang East Railway Station]], opened in the late 2010 in the eastern suburbs of Yichang,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discoverchina.com/yichang|title=Yichang|website=Discover China|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref> is presently the city's main train station. It is the junction point of two segments of the [[Huhanrong Passenger Dedicated Line|Shanghai-Wuhan-Chengdu Passenger Dedicated Line]], one of China's new east–west rail mainlines. To the east, the [[Hanyi Railway]]<ref name=hanyi1>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110707042600/http://english.wh.gov.cn/html/Wuhan_News/Wuhan_News/20080710/1937.html Construction of Hanyi Railway to Kick off], Wuhan City Government web site, 2008-07-10</ref>  (opened June 29, 2012) provides frequent service to [[Wuhan]], with some trains continuing to Nanjing and Shanghai. To the west, the [[Yiwan Railway]] (Yichang-[[Wanzhou]]; opened December 2010) serves as the gateway to Hubei's southwestern panhandle ([[Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture|Enshi]]), with some service continuing to [[Chongqing]] and [[Chengdu]].

The [[Jiaozuo–Liuzhou Railway]], a north–south line, crosses the eastern part of the prefecture-level city. It crosses the Yangtze at [[Zhicheng]] in [[Yidu, Hubei|Yidu County-level City]].
<!--  
Currently, Yichang is a dead-end station. However, construction work has started on the high-speed [[Hanyi Railway]]<ref name=hanyi1>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110707042600/http://english.wh.gov.cn/html/Wuhan_News/Wuhan_News/20080710/1937.html Construction of Hanyi Railway to Kick off], Wuhan City Government web site, 2008-07-10</ref> and the [[Yiwan Railway]] (from [[Hankou]] ([[Wuhan]]) to Yichang to [[Wanzhou]]), which will be part of the [[Huhanrong Passenger Dedicated Line]] from [[Shanghai]] to [[Wuhan]] to [[Chengdu]]. Besides the new [[Yichang East Railway Station]] serving Yichang's main urban area, some the high-speed trains will stop elsewhere in the prefecture, namely at [[Zhijiang Railway Station]] on the Hanyi line (in [[Zhijiang, Hubei|Zhijiang]] City), and at some stations on the Yiwan line.-->
