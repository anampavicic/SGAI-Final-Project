'''Anaheim''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|ə|h|aɪ|m}} {{respell|AN|ə|hyme}}) is a city in northern [[Orange County, California]], United States, part of the [[Greater Los Angeles]] area. As of the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], the city had a population of 346,824, making it the most populous city in Orange County, the [[List of municipalities in California|tenth-most populous city]] in [[California]], and the [[List of United States cities by population|56th-most populous city]] in the [[United States]].<ref name=pop>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/anaheimcitycalifornia|title=QuickFacts Anaheim city, California|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]}}</ref> The second largest city in Orange County in terms of land area, Anaheim is known for being the home of the [[Disneyland Resort]], the [[Anaheim Convention Center]], and two [[professional sports]] teams: the [[Los Angeles Angels]] of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) and the [[Anaheim Ducks]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). It also served as the home of the [[Los Angeles Rams]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) from 1980 through 1994.

Anaheim was founded by fifty [[German American|German families]] in 1857 and [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] as the second city in [[Los Angeles County]] on March 18, 1876;<ref name=LAFC/> Orange County was split off from Los Angeles County in 1889. Anaheim remained largely an agricultural community until [[Disneyland Resort|Disneyland]] opened on July 17, 1955. This led to the construction of several hotels and motels around the area, and residential districts in Anaheim soon followed. The city also developed into an industrial center, producing electronics, aircraft parts and canned fruit. Anaheim is a [[charter city]].<ref>{{Cite web

Anaheim's city limits extend almost the full width of Orange County, from [[Cypress, California|Cypress]] in the west, twenty miles east to the [[Riverside County]] line, encompassing a diverse range of neighborhoods. In the west, mid-20th-century [[tract house]]s predominate. [[Downtown Anaheim]] has three mixed-use historic districts, the largest of which is the Anaheim Colony. South of downtown, a center of commercial activity of regional importance begins, the [[Anaheim–Santa Ana edge city]], which stretches east and south into the cities of [[Orange, California|Orange]], [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]], and [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]]. This [[edge city]] includes the [[Disneyland Resort]], with two theme parks, multiple hotels, and [[Downtown Disney|its retail district]]; Disney is part of the larger Anaheim Resort district with numerous other hotels and retail complexes. The [[Platinum Triangle, Anaheim|Platinum Triangle]], a neo-urban [[redevelopment]] district surrounding [[Angel Stadium]], which is planned to be populated with mixed-use streets and high-rises. Further east, Anaheim Canyon is an industrial district north of the [[California State Route 91|Riverside Freeway (SR 91)]] and east of the [[California State Route 57|Orange Freeway (SR 57)]]. The city's eastern third consists of [[Anaheim Hills]], a community built to a master plan, and open land east of the [[California State Route 241|Eastern Transportation Corridor (SR 241 toll road)]].

==Toponymy==
Anaheim's name is a [[Blend word|blend]] of ''Ana'', after the nearby [[Santa Ana River]], and German ''[[wikt:Heim|-heim]]'' meaning "home", which is also a common [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] place name compound (compare [[Trondheim]] in Norway and [[:de:-heim|many place names]] in Germany).<ref name=gudde>{{cite book|first=Erwin|last=Gudde| author2 =William Bright |title=California Place Names|year=2004|edition=Fourth|publisher=University of California Press|page=12|isbn=978-0-520-24217-3}}</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Anaheim, California}}

===Tongva era===
[[Tongva]] people are indigenous to Anaheim's region of Southern California. Evidence suggests their presence [[Tongva#Before the mission period|since 3500 BCE]]. The Tongva village at Anaheim was called [[Hutuknga|Hutuukuga]].<ref name="Bowers">{{citation |url=http://www.tongvapeople.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Bowers-Curriculum-Guide.pdf|title=Southern California Indian Curriculum Guide|publisher=The Bowers Museum of Cultural Art|date=2002}}</ref> The village has been noted as one of the largest Tongva villages throughout [[Tovaangar]].<ref name=":12">{{Cite book |last1=Koerper |first1=Henry |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZweaDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA64|title=Catalysts to complexity : late Holocene societies of the California coast |last2=Mason |first2=Roger |last3= Peterson |first3=Mark |date=2002 |publisher=Cotsen Institute of Archaeology at UCLA |editor1-first=Jon|editor1-last= Erlandson|editor2-first= Terry L.|editor2-last= Jones|editor3-first= Jeanne E.|editor3-last= Arnold |isbn=978-1-938770-67-8 |location=Los Angeles |pages=64–66, 79 |oclc=745176510|chapter = Complexity, Demography, and Change in Late Holocene Orange County}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite book |last=Brigandi |first=Phil |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/914181947 |title= Orange County chronicles |date=2013 |isbn=978-1-62584-588-7 |location=Charleston |oclc=914181947 |publisher= The History Press }}</ref> [[Native species|Native plants]] like [[oak trees]] and [[Salvia|sage]] bushes were an important food source, as well as rabbit and [[mule deer]] for meat.

===Spanish and Mexican era===
The area that makes up modern-day Anaheim, along with [[Placentia, California|Placentia]] and [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]], were part of the [[Rancho San Juan Cajón de Santa Ana]], a Mexican-era [[ranchos of California|rancho grant]], given to Juan Pacífico Ontiveros in 1837 by [[Juan Bautista Alvarado]], then [[Governor of Alta California]]. Following the American [[Conquest of California]], the rancho was patented to Ontiveros by [[Public Land Commission]]. In 1857, Ontiveros sold 1,160 acres (out of his more than 35,000 acre estate) to 50 German-American families for the founding of Anaheim.

===Early 20th century===
[[File:Front exterior of Anaheim High School, ca.1900 (CHS-2815).jpg|thumb|Anaheim High School, {{Circa|1900}}]]
During the first half of the 20th century, Anaheim was a massive rural community dominated by orange [[Grove (nature)|groves]] and the [[landowners]] who farmed them. One of the landowners was Bennett Payne Baxter, who owned much land in northeast Anaheim that today is the location of Angel Stadium.<ref name="anaheim2">{{cite web|url=http://www.anaheim.net/article.asp?id=235 |title=City of Anaheim&nbsp;– Parks Division |publisher=Anaheim.net |access-date=October 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124172552/http://www.anaheim.net/article.asp?id=235 |archive-date=November 24, 2011 }}</ref> He came up with many new ideas for irrigating orange groves and shared his ideas with other landowners. He was not only successful, he helped other landowners and businesspeople succeed as well. Ben Baxter and other landowners helped to make Anaheim a thriving rural community before the opening of [[Disneyland]] transformed the city. A street along Edison Park<ref name="anaheim2"/> is named Baxter Street. Also during this time, [[Rudolph Boysen]] served as Anaheim's first Park Superintendent from 1921 to 1950. Boysen created a hybrid berry which [[Walter Knott]] later named the [[boysenberry]], after Rudy Boysen. Boysen Park<ref>{{cite web|url=http://events.ocregister.com/anaheim-ca/venues/show/30634-boysen-park |title=Boysen Park |publisher=Events.ocregister.com |access-date=November 25, 2012}}</ref> in East Anaheim was also named after him.

[[File:Anaheim-1922.jpg|thumb|right|Anaheim in 1922]]
In 1924, [[Ku Klux Klan]] members were elected to the Anaheim City Council on a platform of political reform. Up until that point, the city had been controlled by a long-standing business and civic elite that was mostly [[German American]]. Given their tradition of moderate social drinking, the German Americans did not strongly support [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition laws]] of the day. The mayor himself was a former saloon keeper. Led by the minister of the First Christian Church, the Klan represented a rising group of politically oriented non-ethnic Germans who denounced the elite as corrupt, undemocratic, and self-serving. The Klansmen aimed to create what they saw as a model, orderly community, one in which prohibition against alcohol would be strictly enforced. At the time, the KKK had about 1,200 members in Orange County. The economic and occupational profile of the pro and anti-Klan groups shows the two were similar and about equally prosperous. Klan members were Protestants, as were the majority of their opponents; however, the opposition to the Klan also included many [[Catholic Germans]]. Individuals who joined the Klan had earlier demonstrated a much higher rate of voting and civic activism than did their opponents, and many of the individuals in Orange County who joined the Klan did so out of a sense of civic activism. Upon easily winning the local Anaheim election in April 1924, the Klan representatives promptly fired city employees who were known to be Catholic and replaced them with Klan appointees. The new city council tried to enforce prohibition. After its victory, the Klan chapter held large rallies and initiation ceremonies over the summer.<ref name="Cocoltchos"/>

The opposition to the KKK's hold on Anaheim politics organized, bribed a Klansman for their secret membership list, and exposed the Klansmen running in the state primaries, defeating most of the candidates. In 1925, Klan opponents took back local government, and succeeded in a special election in recalling the Klansmen who had been elected in April 1924. The Klan in Anaheim quickly collapsed; its newspaper closed after losing a libel suit, and the minister who led the local Klavern moved to Kansas.<ref name="Cocoltchos">Christopher N. Cocoltchos, "The Invisible Empire and the Search for the Orderly Community: The Ku Klux Klan in Anaheim, California", in Shawn Lay, ed. ''The invisible empire in the West'' (2004), pp. 97–120.</ref>

===Mid to late 20th century: Disneyland and the Anaheim Resort===

Construction of the [[Disneyland]] theme park began on July 16, 1954, and it opened to the public on July 17, 1955. It has become one of the world's most visited tourist attractions, with over 650&nbsp;million visitors since its opening. The location was formerly {{convert|160|acre|km2}} of orange and walnut trees. The opening of Disneyland created a tourism boom in the Anaheim area. [[Walt Disney]] had originally intended to purchase additional land to build accommodations for Disneyland visitors; however, the park's construction drained his financial resources and he was unable to acquire more land. [[Entrepreneur]]s eager to capitalize on Disney's success moved in and built hotels, restaurants, and shops around Disneyland and eventually boxed in the Disney property, and turned the area surrounding Disneyland into the boulevards of colorful [[neon sign]]s that Walt Disney had tried to avoid. The city of Anaheim, eager for tax revenue these hotels would generate, did little to obstruct their construction.<ref>{{cite book |last1=France |first1=Van Arsdale |title=Window on Main Street : 35 years of creating happiness at Disneyland Park |date=1991 |publisher=Laughter Publications |location=Nashua, NH |isbn=0-941613-17-8 |page=17 |edition=1st}}</ref>

By the mid-1960s, the city's explosive growth would attract a [[Major League Baseball]] team, with the [[California Angels]] relocating from Los Angeles to Anaheim in 1966, where they have remained since. In 1980, the [[National Football League]]'s [[Los Angeles Rams]] relocated from the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] to the Angels' home field, [[Anaheim Stadium]], playing there until their relocation to [[St. Louis]] in 1995. In 1993, Anaheim gained its own [[National Hockey League]] team when [[The Walt Disney Company]] founded the [[Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]].

In the 1990s, while Disneyland was undergoing a significant expansion project surrounding the construction of [[Disney California Adventure Park]], the city of Anaheim rebranded the surrounding area as the Anaheim Resort. The Anaheim Resort district is roughly bounded by the [[Santa Ana River]] to the east, Ball Road to the north, Walnut Street to the west, and the [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]] city limits to the south at Chapman Avenue, and Orangewood Avenue to the southwest.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?qscrl=1&nord=1&rlz=1T4TSND_enUS441US412&q=Anaheim+Resort&ion=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&biw=1303&bih=596&wrapid=tlif134126507311210&um=1&sa=N&tab=wl |title=Anaheim Resort |publisher=Google Maps |access-date=July 4, 2012}}</ref> Attractions within the Resort District include the [[Disneyland Resort]], the [[Anaheim Convention Center]], the [[Honda Center]], Anaheim/Orange County Walk of Stars, and [[Angel Stadium of Anaheim]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anaheim.net |title=City of Anaheim official site |publisher=Anaheim.net |date=March 7, 2012 |access-date=July 4, 2012}}</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Sleepingbeautycastle50.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sleeping Beauty Castle]] at Disneyland during the park's 50th anniversary celebration]]

Anaheim's income is based on a tourism economy. In addition to [[The Walt Disney Company]] being the city's largest employer, the [[Disneyland Resort]] itself contributes about $4.7&nbsp;billion annually to Southern California's economy. It also produces $255&nbsp;million in taxes every year.<ref>''Disneyland Resort Public Affairs.'' Disneyland. Web. May 20, 2014.{{full citation needed|date=October 2023}}</ref> Another source of tourism is the Anaheim Convention Center, which is home to many important national conferences. Many hotels, especially in the city's Resort district, serve theme park tourists and conventiongoers. Continuous development of commercial, entertainment, and cultural facilities stretches from the Disney area east to the Santa Ana River, south into the cities of Garden Grove, Orange and Santa Ana – collectively, this area has been labeled the [[Anaheim–Santa Ana edge city]] and is one of the three largest such clusters in Orange County, together with the [[South Coast Plaza–John Wayne Airport edge city]] and [[Irvine Spectrum]].

The Anaheim Canyon business park makes up 63% of Anaheim's industrial space and is the largest industrial district in Orange County. Anaheim Canyon is also home to the second-largest business park in Orange County.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/operations/shipping-rail-shipping/927405-1.html |title=Anaheim, Developers Plan Condos Next to Canyon Train Station {{pipe}} Orange County Business Journal {{pipe}} Professional Journal archives from |publisher=AllBusiness.com |access-date=October 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512005402/http://www.allbusiness.com/operations/shipping-rail-shipping/927405-1.html |archive-date=May 12, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-jul-22-fi-boeing22-story.html | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Boeing to Close Historic Anaheim Facility | first1=Martin | last1=Zimmerman | first2=Roger | last2=Vincent | first3=Mai | last3=Tran | date=July 22, 2006}}</ref>

===Court battle against the Angels===
{{Main|City of Anaheim v. Angels Baseball LP}}
[[File:Angel Stadium of Anaheim.jpg|thumb|[[Angel Stadium]] of Anaheim in 2003]]

On January 3, 2005, Angels Baseball LP, the ownership group for the Anaheim Angels, announced that it would change the name of the club to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Team spokesmen pointed out that from its inception, the Angels had been granted territorial rights by [[Major League Baseball]] to the counties of [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]], [[Ventura County, California|Ventura]], [[Riverside County, California|Riverside]], and [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino]] in addition to Orange County. The new owner, [[Arturo Moreno]], believed the name would help him market the team to the entire Southern California region rather than just Orange County. The "of Anaheim" was included in the official name to comply with a provision of the team's lease at Angel Stadium which requires that "Anaheim" be included in the team's name.

Mayor [[Curt Pringle]] and other city officials countered that the name change violated the spirit of the lease clause, even if it was in technical compliance. They argued that a name change was a major bargaining chip in negotiations between the city and Disney Baseball Enterprises, Inc., then the ownership group for the Angels. They further argued that the city would never have agreed to the new lease without the name change, because the new lease required that the city partially fund the stadium's renovation, but provided very little revenue for Anaheim. Anaheim sued Angels Baseball LP in Orange County [[Superior Court]], and a jury [[trial]] was completed in early February 2006, resulting in a victory for the Angels franchise.

Anaheim appealed the court decision with the [[California Court of Appeal]] in May 2006. The case was tied up in the Appeals Court for over two years. In December 2008, the Appeals Court upheld the February 2006 Decision and ruled in favor of Angels Baseball. In January 2009, the Anaheim City Council voted not to appeal the court case any further, bringing an end to the four-year legal dispute.

===City government===
[[File:Anaheimcityhall.jpg|right|thumb|Anaheim City Hall]]
{{See also|List of mayors of Anaheim, California|Anaheim City Council}}
Under its [[city charter]], Anaheim operates under a [[council–manager government]]. Legislative authority is vested in a [[city council]] of seven [[Non-partisan democracy|nonpartisan]] members, who hire a professional city manager to oversee day-to-day operations. The mayor serves as the presiding officer of the city council in a [[first among equals]] role. Under the city's [[term limit]]s, an individual may serve a maximum of two terms as a city council member and two terms as the mayor.

Up until 2014, all council seats were elected at large. Voters elected the mayor and four other members of the city council to serve four-year staggered terms. Elections for two council seats were held in years divisible by four while elections for the mayor and the two other council seats were elected during the intervening even-numbered years.

In response to [[2012 Anaheim, California police shooting and protests|protests]] and a [[California Voting Rights Act]] lawsuit by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and several residents, the city placed two measures on the November 2014 ballot. Measure L proposed that council members be elected by district instead of at large. Measure M proposed to increase the number of council seats from five to seven. Both measures passed.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Do| first = Anh| date = November 5, 2014| title = Backers of Anaheim's Measure L anticipate better representation| url = http://www.latimes.com/local/orangecounty/la-me-ff-1006-anaheim-council-districts-20141106-story.html| newspaper = Los Angeles Times| access-date = December 16, 2014}}</ref>
