Bauchi, [[Tafawa Balewa]], [[Dass, Nigeria|Dass]], [[Toro, Nigeria|Toro]], [[Bogoro]], [[Ningi, Nigeria|Ningi]], [[Warji]], [[Ganjuwa]], [[Kirfi]], [[Alkaleri]], [[Darazo]], [[Misau]], [[Giade]], [[Shira, Nigeria|Shira]], [[Jamaare]], [[Katagum]], [[Itas/Gadau]], [[Zaki]], [[Gamawa]] and [[Damban]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bauchi State List of Local Governments Zip codes {{!}} Nigeria Zip Codes|url=http://mycyberict.com/nigeria_zip_codes/bauchi-state/|access-date=2020-08-18|website=mycyberict.com}}</ref>

==History==
The emirate was founded in (1800–10) by Yakubu, one of Sheikhs Usman dan Fodio's commanders. Yakubu conquered a sparsely wooded savanna region (the Bauchi High Plains) mainly inhabited by non-Muslim peoples. After successful campaigns,he (Yakubu) founded (1809) the town of Bauchi. Yakubu built the town’s walls, the circumference of which measures 6.5 miles (10.5 km). 
The only non-[[Fula people|Fulani]] flag-bearer of the [[Sokoto Empire]].  The name was derived from a hunter called Baushe, who advised Yaqub to build his city west of the Warinje mountain.  In return Yaqub promised to name his city after the hunter.

Several of the subject peoples successfully revolted under the rule of his son and successor, Emir Ibrahim ibn Yakubu. Emir Usman moved the capital to Rauta (35 miles northwest) in 1877, but Bauchi once again became the emirate headquarters when, in 1902, the British occupied the town and deposed Emir Umaru. The town served as the provincial capital from 1904 until 1911 and again from 1917 to 1924. In 1926 it became the headquarters of Bauchi province and in 1976, it became the capital of the newly created Bauchi state.
[[Abubakar Tafawa Balewa]] is buried in the city, while the [[Yankari National Park]] is 110&nbsp;km from the state capital.
The city lies on the [[Port Harcourt]] – [[Maiduguri]] [[railway line]]. The [[List of libraries in Nigeria|Bauchi State Library Board]] was established in 1976.<ref name=saur2011>{{citation |publisher = De Gruyter Saur |isbn = 9783110230710 |title = World Guide to Libraries |edition=25th |date = 2011 }}</ref>
With the coming of the railway in 1961, Bauchi grew as a collecting point for peanuts (groundnuts) and cotton and a trade centre in sorghum, millet, cowpeas, corn (maize), cassava, and vegetables and in cattle, goats, and sheep. Cotton weaving and dyeing, tanning, and blacksmithing are traditional activities. The town’s industry includes an asbestos factory and a meat-products processing plant. [[Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University]] (1980; originally called Federal University of Technology) and a federal polytechnic college are in the town. Pop. (2006) local government area, 493,810; (2016 est.) 415,000.[https://www.britannica.com/place/Bauchi-Nigeria]

== Transport ==
Bauchi was originally served by a [[narrow gauge]] {{RailGauge|762mm}} [[light railway]], but this was later converted to the normal gauge of {{RailGauge|1067mm}}.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V8CnPe_ANbcC&pg=PA144 |title=Nigeria Under British Rule - Sir William Nevill Montgomerie Geary - Google Books |year=1965 |isbn=9780714616667 |access-date=2013-12-10}}</ref>
