Hospet was built in 1520 AD by [[Krishna Deva Raya]], one of the prominent rulers of [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. He built the city in honour of his mother Naagalaambika. The city was originally named Naagalapura; however, people referred to the city as ''Hosa Pete'', which means "New City". The area between Hampi and Hospet is still called Naagalapura. This was the main entrance to the city of Vijayanagara for travellers coming from the west coast.

The current [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]] for this area is Anand Singh.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mine lessees slug it out in Vijayanagar|url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mine-lessees-slug-it-out-in-vijayanagar/article4675140.ece|newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=2 May 2013}}</ref> The government approved a request to rename the city in October 2014, and Hospet was renamed "Hosapete" on 1 November 2014.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Probhu |first1=Nagesh |date=1 November 2014 |title=Good morning, Bengaluru. 12 cities in State to have new names from today |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/from-bangalore-to-bengaluru/article6553314.ece |work=[[The Hindu]] |access-date=14 June 2024}}</ref>
