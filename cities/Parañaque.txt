'''Parañaque''', officially the '''City of''' '''Parañaque''' ({{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Parañaque}}, {{IPA|tl|paɾaˈɲäke̞}}), is a [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|highly urbanized city]] in the [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]] of the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 689,992 people.{{PH census|current}}

It is bordered to the north by [[Pasay]], to the northeast by [[Taguig]], to the southeast by [[Muntinlupa]], to the southwest by [[Las Piñas]], and to the west by [[Manila Bay]]. Like the rest of [[Metro Manila]], Parañaque experiences a tropical climate with only two distinct seasons, wet (July to September) and dry (October to June). The city enjoys an annual rainfall of {{convert|1822|mm|sp=us}} and an average daily maximum temperature of {{convert|34.4|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Physical Profile|url=http://www.paranaque.gov.ph/home/index.php/about-the-city|work=About the City|publisher=Parañaque City|access-date=March 7, 2013|pages=15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630075519/http://www.paranaque.gov.ph/home/index.php/about-the-city|archive-date=June 30, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Parañaque is the home of [[Entertainment City]], a gaming and entertainment complex under development by the state-owned [[Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation]], spanning an area of {{convert|8|sqkm|abbr=on}} in [[Bay City, Metro Manila|Bay City]], where four large integrated resorts are based namely [[Solaire Resort & Casino]], [[City of Dreams Manila]], [[Okada Manila]], and the soon to be completed Westside City Resorts World. It is also the home of the [[Parañaque Integrated Terminal Exchange]] public transport terminal and the [[Aseana City]] business district development which includes [[Ayala Malls Manila Bay]].

==Etymology==
Several myths exist as to how Parañaque got its name. One story holds that long ago, a [[banyan|''balete'']] (banyan) tree that looked like a majestic ship stood at the mouth of what is now called the [[Parañaque River]]. It earned the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] name ''Palanyag'', taken from the term "''palayag''", which means “point of navigation”.<ref name=Etymology>{{cite web |author1=Baybay, D. F. |author2=Marquez-De Guzman, A. |title=Palanyag to Parañaque: A History |url=http://paranaque.gov.ph/history/ |publisher=City of Parañaque |year=2001 |access-date=April 25, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426215523/http://paranaque.gov.ph/history/ |archive-date=April 26, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Another folktale says that before the Spaniards arrived, there were [[natives]] who lived close to Manila Bay, and their occupation was fishing (''pangingisdâ''). Their neighbours to the east in present-day [[Muntinlupa]] were farmers and called "''tagá-palayán''" ("of the [[Paddy field|rice paddies]]"). One day, the fishermen and rice farmers held a feast, and were drunk from ''[[tubâ]]'' (coconut toddy). One farmer suggested they name the whole place "''Palayán''" as a sign of cooperation and goodwill between them. A fisherman protested, saying they should name it "''Palalayag''" instead. As a compromise, they agreed to [[Portmanteau|merge]] the two words and came up with "''Palalanyag''". Another drunken guest shouted, “''Mabuhay ang Palanyag at ang mga tagá-Palanyag!”'' ("Long live ''Palanyag'' and those of ''Palanyag''!") The rest liked this word better, and the place was called "''Palanyag''".<ref name=Etymology/>

A third myth suggests that Spanish soldiers in a horse-drawn carriage asked to be taken to a certain place. When they arrived, one of the soldiers ordered, "''¡Para aquí! ¡Para aquí!"'' (“Stop here! Stop here!”), which the coachman did not understand. The soldier repeated it and later, the coachman left the carriage and told others “These Spaniards are repeatedly saying "''para aniya ake...para aniya ake''” to the laughter of the crowd. The story spread, and the term "''Para Aniya Ake''" stuck.<ref name=Etymology/>

===Historical account===
<blockquote>"''On the coast near Manila are Laguo (i.e. [[Ermita|Lagyo]]), [[Malate, Manila|Malahat]], [[Don Galo|Longalo]], '''Palañac''', [[Bacoor|Vakol]], [[Kawit|Minacaya]], and [[Kawit|Cavite]]. All these villages are in the neighborhood of Cavite, and belong to His Majesty, to whom they pay tribute.''"

– Miguel de Loarca, ''Relación de Yslas Filipinas'' (1582)<ref name="BRV5">{{cite book |last=Blair |first=Emma |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16501/16501-h/16501-h.htm#d0e420 |title=The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898 Vol. 5 |publisher=Arthur H.

[[File:Old Parañaque 2.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The town of Parañaque around 1898, at the beginning of the American Occupation]]

===Early history===
Due to their proximity to the sea, the early Parañaqueños traded with the Chinese, Japanese, Indonesians, Indians, and Malays. Traditional occupations and trades included saltmaking, fishing, planting rice, shoemaking, slipper-making and weaving.<ref name=Etymology/>

===Spanish and American colonial eras===
Parañaque was officially founded in the year 1580 by [[Order of Saint Augustine]] and it was Fray Diego de Espiñar, O.S.A. who became the first minister of the town. The Council of the Definitors (a conference of chiefs of the religious orders) held on May 11, 1580 (Conquistas delas Islas of Fray Gaspar San Agustin, O.S.A.) accepted the village of Palanyag, as Parañaque, as an independent ''pueblo''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/p/Para%C3%B1aque-City-Tourism-Office-100089875615964/|title=ALAM MO BA? ANG EBOLUSYON NG OFFICIAL SEAL NG BAYAN NG PARANAQUE|website=Parañaque City Tourism Office (Facebook)|date=May 11, 2024|access-date=May 30, 2024}}</ref> Other towns in the islands which simultaneously established on the same date according to the 1580 chapter of the Augustinians were [[Malolos]] (in [[Bulacan]]), Bulacabe (on [[Panay]]) and [[Bantayan, Cebu|Bantayan]] (in [[Cebu]]). The image of Palanyag's patroness, Nuestra Señora del Buen Suceso de Palanyag, was brought to [[Parañaque Cathedral|Saint Andrew's Parish]] in [[La Huerta, Parañaque|La Huerta]] on August 10, 1625. Nuestra Señora del Buen Suceso de Palanyag is the third oldest Marian Image in the Philippines.

Early Spanish census dated 1591 to 1593 also mentioned Longalo and Parañaque as two villages along Manila Bay composed of some 800 tribute-payers. Politically, Don Galo and Parañaque were then under the Encomienda and [[Manila (province)|Provincia de Tondo]]. The community was headed by ''cabezas de barangay'', a westernized version of ''[[datus]]'' (chieftains), and the ''[[principalía]]'' (Hispanicised local nobility), who together justified and moderated the demands of the Spanish colonizers. Education was limited to the ''principalía'' as they were the only ones who could afford it.

[[File:Philippine Island - Camp Calvdio - NARA - 68156412.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Camp Claudio in Parañaque, 1917]]
Historical accounts state that the town's strategic location enabled the townspeople to play an important role in Philippine history. Palanyag was located at the crossroads of Manila, between the provinces of Cavite and Batangas. In 1574, during the invasion of the town by the Chinese pirate [[Limahong]], Parañaquenos, particularly those from Don Galo, heroically aided in preventing the attack on Manila. This incident became known as the "Red Sea Incident" due to the blood that flowed through the sacrifice of the people of ''barrio'' Santa Monica. With the arrival of Spanish forces led by Captain [[Juan de Salcedo]] from [[Ilocos (province)|Ilocos]], Limahong was finally repulsed, and the occupation of the town was averted.

When the [[British occupation of Manila|British invaded Manila]] in 1762, the townspeople once again remained loyal to the Spanish colonizers, especially the Augustinians. The invasion however showed that the Spaniards was not invincible and that their rule was not to be permanent. More than a hundred years later, this would prove to be true. During the [[Philippine Revolution]] of 1896–1898, the Spaniards realized that the town was a practical gateway to Cavite, the bastion of the revolutionary [[Katipunan|Katipuneros]]. Conversely, the Katipuneros based in Cavite saw the town as their gateway to [[Intramuros]], the Spanish seat of government in Manila. Prominent Paraqueños such as Manuel Quiogue and secular priest Father Pedro Dandan y Masangkay became leading revolutionary figures.

During the [[History of the Philippines (1898-1946)|American Period of the Philippines]], Parañaque became part of the newly established province of [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]] in 1901. The municipality was previously part of the province of [[Manila (province)|Manila]], which was in turn disestablished.

On October 12, 1903, [[Las Piñas]] was merged to become part of Parañaque.<ref>{{cite PH act|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l89ad|chamber=Act|number=942|date=October 12, 1903|access-date=June 28, 2022|title=An Act Reducing the Thirty-Two Municipalities of the Province of Rizal to Fifteen.|archive-date=April 24, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220424053931/https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l89ad|url-status=live}}</ref> However, it was later separated on March 27, 1907 to become an independent town once again.<ref>{{cite PH act|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l4d28|chamber=Act|number=1625|date=March 27, 1907|access-date=June 19, 2022|title=An Act Increasing the number of municipalities in the Province of Rizal from seventeen to nineteen, by separating from San Felipe Neri the former municipality of San Juan del Monte and from Parañaque the former municipality of Las Piñas, giving to each the territory which it comprised prior to the passage of Act Numbered Nine hundred and forty-two, and providing for the distribution of funds in the municipal treasuries of said municipalities.|archive-date=April 24, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220424054132/https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l4d28|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Japanese occupation era===
[[File:PqueWWII.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A burning building along Taft Avenue which was hit during the Japanese air raid in Parañaque, December 13, 1941.]]
On January 1, 1942, Parañaque was one of the towns of Rizal that was merged with Manila and [[Quezon City]] to form the [[City of Greater Manila]].<ref name="emb">{{cite web|title=Historical Background|url=http://ncr.emb.gov.ph/historicalbackground/|website=DENR - Environment Management Bureau - National Capital Region|access-date=May 28, 2022|archive-date=April 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402134109/http://ncr.emb.gov.ph/historicalbackground/|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]] in [[World War II]], Parañaque supplied leadership to guerilla movements such as the [[Hunters ROTC]], as well as food and arms. Parañaque was one of the first towns to be liberated and its guerillas helped pave the way for the combined American and Philippine Commonwealth forces to enter the south of Manila. As can be gleaned from the above, Parañaque has played and continues to play a strategic role in the Philippines' political and economic progress, as shown by the quick recovery the town shown following the damage it incurred during the long Battle of Manila in 1945. The City of Greater Manila was disestablished effective August 1, 1945.<ref name="eo58">{{cite PH act|chamber=EO|number=58, s. 1945|title=Reducing the Territory of the City of Greater Manila|date=July 26, 1945|access-date=August 24, 2022|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1945/07/26/executive-order-no-58-s-1945/|archive-date=March 8, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230308195829/https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1945/07/26/executive-order-no-58-s-1945/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Parañaque was later converted as the eleventh city of Metro Manila on February 15, 1998, and was chartered and urbanized through President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] during the celebration of the city's 418th Founding Anniversary. Incumbent [[Joey Marquez]] became its first city mayor.

===Contemporary===
Owing to Parañaque's strategic location, it is an important center for trade and business in Metro Manila. [[Baclaran]], where a large number of dry goods stores are located, is one of the busiest markets in the country. Small fishing villages called “fisherman's wharves” are also situated alongside Barangay La Huerta, where the famous DAMPA, a seaside market with numerous restaurants serving fresh seafood, is found. This has the country's international airport and the [[Duty-free shop|Duty Free Philippines]] for imported goods<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.philstar.com/business/2019/01/27/1888380/duty-free-adds-more-pinoy-products-stores|title=Duty Free adds more Pinoy products in stores|work=The Philippine Star|access-date=January 29, 2019|archive-date=January 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190129131512/https://www.philstar.com/business/2019/01/27/1888380/duty-free-adds-more-pinoy-products-stores|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Entertainment City]] where three integrated resorts (IR) licensed by [[Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation]] (PAGCOR) are located.
