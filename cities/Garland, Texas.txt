'''Garland''' is a city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]], located within [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] with portions extending into [[Collin County, Texas|Collin]] and [[Rockwall County, Texas|Rockwall]] counties. It is located northeast of [[Dallas]] and is a part of the [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex]]. In 2020, it had a population of 246,018, making it the [[List of United States cities by population|93rd-most populous]] city in the [[United States]] and the [[List of cities in Texas by population|13th-most populous]] city in Texas. Garland is the third largest city in Dallas County by population and has access to downtown [[Dallas]] via [[public transport]]ation including two [[Blue Line (DART)|DART Blue Line]] stations and buses.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Garland, Texas}}
Immigrants began arriving in the Peters colony area around 1850, but a community was not created until 1874. Two communities sprang up in the area: Embree, named for physician K. H. Embree, and Duck Creek, named for the local creek of the same name. A rivalry between the two towns ensued as the area began to grow around the [[BNSF Railway|Santa Fe Railroad]] depot.

Eventually, to settle a dispute regarding which town should have the local post office, Dallas County Judge Thomas A. Nash asked visiting Congressman [[Joseph Abbott (Texas politician)|Joe Abbott]] to move the post office between the two towns. The move was completed in 1887. The new location was named Garland after [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] [[Augustus Hill Garland]].

Soon after, the towns of Embree and Duck Creek were combined, and the three areas combined to form the city of Garland, which was incorporated in 1891. By 1904, the town had a population of 819 people.<ref name="Garland, TX" />

In 1920, local businessmen financed a new electrical generator plant (sold by [[Fairbanks-Morse]]) for the town. This later led to the formation of Garland Power and Light, the municipal electric provider that still powers the city today.<ref name="Garland, TX"/><ref>{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Garland|url=http://www.ci.garland.tx.us/Home/General+Information/Garland+History/|publisher=City of Garland-|access-date=January 8, 2012|archive-date=February 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220234538/http://www.ci.garland.tx.us/Home/General+Information/Garland+History/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On [[Tornado outbreak of May 1927|May 9, 1927]], a devastating [[Fujita scale|F4]] [[tornado]] struck the town and killed 15 people,<ref>{{cite book|last=Grazulis|first=Thomas P.|title=Significant Tornadoes 1680-1991: A Chronology and Analysis of Events|year=1993|publisher=Environmental Films|location=St. Johnsbury, Vermont|isbn=1-879362-03-1|pages=808–811}}</ref> including the former mayor, S. E. Nicholson.

Businesses began to move back into the area in the late 1930s. The Craddock food company and later the Byer-Rolnick hat factory (now owned by [[Resistol]]) moved into the area. In 1937, [[KRLD (AM)|KRLD]], a major Dallas radio station, built its radio antenna tower in Garland, and it is operational to this day.

During [[World War II]], several aircraft plants were operated in the area, and the [[Kraft Foods]] company purchased a vacant one after the war for its own use. By 1950, the population of Garland exceeded 10,000 people.<ref name="Garland, TX" /> From 1950 to 1954, though, the Dallas/Garland area suffered from a serious and extended [[drought]], so to supplement the water provided by wells, Garland began using the water from the nearby [[Lake Lavon]].

The suburban population boom that the whole country experienced after World War II also reached Garland by 1960, when the population nearly quadrupled from the 1950 figure to about 38,500. By 1970, the population had doubled to about 81,500. By 1980, the population reached 138,850.<ref name="Garland, TX" /> [[Charles Matthews (Texas politician)|Charles R. Matthews]] served as mayor in the 1980s; he was later a member of the elected [[Texas Railroad Commission]].

In the 2000s, Garland added several notable developments, mostly in the northern portion of the city. [[Hawaiian Falls Garland|Hawaiian Falls]] [[waterpark]] opened in 2003. (Garland formerly had a Wet 'n Wild waterpark, which closed in 1993). The [[Garland Independent School District]]'s Curtis Culwell Center (formerly called the Special Events Center),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.specialeventscenter.com/|title=Curtis Culwell Center|work=specialeventscenter.com|access-date=May 4, 2015}}</ref> an arena and conference facility, opened in 2005. Later that year, [[Firewheel Town Center]], a Main Street-style outdoor mall, owned by Simon Property Group, opened in October 2005.

It has over 100 business and includes an AMC theater. In 2009, the city, in conjunction with developer [[Trammell Crow Company]], finished a public/private partnership to develop the old parking lot (the land between 5th Street, 6th Street, and on the north side of Austin Street) into a new [[mixed-use]], [[transit-oriented development]] named 5th Street Crossing. Cater-corner to both City Hall and the downtown [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit|DART]] Rail station, the project consists of 189 residential apartment units, {{convert|11000|sqft}} of flex retail, and six live-work units.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jhparch.com/onesheets/w_5th_Street_Crossing.pdf|title=JHP - Architecture & Urban Design|website=Jhparch.com|date=August 12, 2016|access-date=August 27, 2017}}</ref>

The southeast side of Garland suffered a major blow on the night of [[December 2015 North American storm complex|December 26, 2015]], after [[2015 Garland tornado|a large EF4 tornado struck the area]], moving north from Sunnyvale. Nine fatalities were confirmed in the city from this event.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2015/12/27/severe-weather-tornadoes-texas-south/77939562/|title= Texas under siege: Tornadoes, flooding, snow and ice|publisher=USAToday|access-date=December 27, 2015}}</ref> Exactly 6 years later, [[2021 Garland shooting|a mass shooting]] took place at a convenience store in Garland, resulting in the deaths of 3 people.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-12-28 |title=Suspect arrested after Texas convenience store shooting that killed 3 |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/three-dead-one-critical-garland-texas-convenience-store-shooting-rcna10034 |access-date=2024-10-09 |website=NBC News |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Keller |first=Alex |date=2023-02-10 |title=Father of Texas teen accused in triple murder found guilty of capital murder for driving getaway car |url=https://www.kwtx.com/2023/02/10/father-texas-teen-accused-triple-murder-found-guilty-capital-murder-driving-getaway-car/ |access-date=2024-10-09 |website=KWTX |language=en}}</ref>

In the late 1930s, the Craddock food company, which manufactured [[pickled cucumber|pickles]], moved to town. In 1937, the [[KRLD (AM)|KRLD]] (Dallas) radio tower was constructed in Garland.

Byer and Harry Rolnick, who established Byer-Rolnick in Dallas in 1927. At the time, the company produced men's felt hats. The company used the name "Resistol Hats" to indicate that the hats could "resist-all" weather conditions. Some accounts contend the name was given because the headbands in the company's hats were more resistant to scalp oil.<ref name="Resistol Hat History">{{cite web|title=Resistol Hat History|url=http://www.resistolhat.com/history.php|publisher=Resistol Hats|access-date=December 25, 2011}}</ref> The growing firm needed to expand.

===Utilities===
The city of Garland operates the city's water system and waste services. Electricity for about 85% of Garland is provided by the city's municipal utility, Garland Power and Light (GP&L). Electricity for the other 15% was formerly provided by [[Energy Future Holdings|TXU]], but is now supplied by multiple companies after [[deregulation of the Texas electricity market]].

====Water and wastewater utilities====

Garland is an original member city of the North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD).  The vision of the city fathers in the early 1940s resulted in Garland and its companion member cities benefitting from reliable, high quality, affordable water from the water district's many reservoirs.

The effluent from Garland's wastewater treatment plant flows through a NTMWD man-made, {{convert|1840|acre|km2|adj=on}} wetland.  This provides a natural habitat for a wide variety of birds and reduces the sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus contents of the water to a drinkable level. Through the use of selected aquatic plants, this environmentally friendly project will provide millions of gallons of reusable water and reduce the environmental impact.

====Garland Power and Light====

GP&L was founded in 1923 to provide Garland residents not-for-profit [[public utility]] services, locally controlled by its citizens. GP&L provides services to over 69,000 customers, making it the fourth-largest municipal utility in Texas and the 41st-largest in the nation.
It has two gas-fired generating plants, which combined have 640 megawatts of generation capacity.  Garland also partners with the Texas Municipal Power Agency, which operates the 462-megawatt coal-fired Gibbons Creek Power Plant. Garland's electric distribution system has {{convert|1007|mi|km|abbr=on}} of overhead lines and {{convert|1000|mi|km|abbr=on}} of underground lines. Its transmission system consists of 23 substations and {{convert|133|mi|km|abbr=on}} of transmission lines. Garland's peak load for 2007 was 483 megawatts, with annual operating revenues of nearly $238 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garlandpower-light.org/aboutus.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120731173428/http://www.garlandpower-light.org/aboutus.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 31, 2012|title=Welcome To Garland Power & Light|work=garlandpower-light.org|access-date=May 4, 2015}}</ref>
