== Geography ==
Narowal lies from 31° 55' to 32° 30' latitude and 74° 35' to 75° 21' longitude. It is located in the northeast part of [[Punjab, Pakistan]], about 96 kilometers north of the provincial capital [[Lahore]]. The Narowal District borders [[Sialkot]] to the west, [[Sheikhupura]] to the South, [[Gurdaspur]] (Eastern Punjab, India) to the east, and the [[Kathua]] District and [[Jammu]] Kashmir to the north.

== Etymology ==

== History == 
In the sixteenth century, Narowal was a small village consisting of only a few houses of labourers around the farmhouse of Land-Lord Naro Singh Bajwa o.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://narowal.gop.pk/381/ | title=District History – Narowal's Official Website | access-date=2019-11-06 | archive-date=2019-11-06 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191106204347/http://narowal.gop.pk/381/ | url-status=live }}</ref>  The city is the capital of [[Narowal District]]. The history of modern Narowal dates back to 90 years when Britishers established a railway link between eastern and western Punjab in its bid to strengthen their grip over Punjab. With the establishment of the railway junctions, investment begins to flow and the city begins to flourish with the passage of time. After the partition and establishment of Pakistan, the railway line between the east and west Punjab was blown off for security reasons. Initially, Narowal was a part of [[Sialkot]] district, later gained the status of Tehsil before becoming the District in 1992.
