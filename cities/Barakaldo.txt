'''Barakaldo''' ({{langx|es|Baracaldo}}; {{langx|eu|Barakaldo}} {{IPA-eu|baɾakalðo|}}) is a [[Municipalities of Spain|municipality]] located in the [[Biscay]] province in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] in [[Spain]]. Located on the [[Left Bank (Biscay)|Left Bank]] of the [[Estuary of Bilbao]], the city is part of [[Greater Bilbao]], has a population {{as of|2019||alt=as of the 2019 census}} at 100,881.<ref>Instituto Nacional de Estadistica, Madrid.</ref> Barakaldo has an industrial river-port heritage and has undergone significant redevelopment with new commercial and residential areas replacing the once active industrial zones.

== History ==
[[File:Puente del Diablo sobre el río Cadagua.jpg|thumb|Devil's Bridge over the river [[River Cadagua|Cadagua]] between Barakaldo and Bilbao|left]]

The [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]]{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} original entry on the town stated:
{{quote|"Pop.(1900): 15,013. Few Spanish towns have developed more rapidly than Baracaldo {{sic}}, which nearly doubled its population between 1880 and 1900. During this period many immigrant labourers settled here; for the iron works and dynamite factory of Baracaldo prospered greatly, owing to the increased output of the Biscayan mines, the extension of railways in the neighbourhood, and the growth of shipping at Bilbao. The low flat country round Barakaldo is covered with maize, pod fruit and vines".}}

Iron mining formed a large part of Barakaldo's industry, making it the endpoint of a mining railway. The steel industry, led by [[Altos Hornos de Vizcaya]], had an important presence during the 20th century, until the industrial recession hit the region's economy in the 1980s.

In recent decades, the industrial zones surrounding Barakaldo have become less prominent, which can be owed to the shuttering of large companies such as [[Babcock & Wilcox]]. Although several factories remain, areas that were once industrial have been redeveloped into residential properties such as malls and parks. A large exhibition centre. the [[Bilbao Exhibition Centre]] has recently been built on the outskirts of the town.

==Transport==

Four stations are in the city: [[Gurutzeta/Cruces (Metro Bilbao)|Gurutzeta/Cruces]], [[Ansio (Metro Bilbao)|Ansio]], [[Barakaldo (Metro Bilbao)|Barakaldo]] and [[Bagatza (Metro Bilbao)|Bagatza]]). The [[Cercanías Bilbao]] train line has two stations in Barakaldo (Lutxana and Desertu-Barakaldo). [[BizkaiBus]] company provides a bus service, with connections to the rest of Biscay.

Locally, an urban bus system named Kbus operates with two lines. A tram line has been proposed to connect local districts.

The main motorway is the [[Autovía A-8|A-8 motorway]], which also goes between Bilbao. It serves as the main road link between Greater Bilbao and the rest of Spain.

A boat ferry service connects Barakaldo to the other side of the [[Estuary of Bilbao]] in [[Erandio]]. Barakaldo is located {{convert|15|km|mi}}  from [[Bilbao Airport]].

== Demographics ==
Population peaked in the 1990s to over 100,300. The decline of local industry decreased the population, though, and in 2002, 95,000 people lived in Barakaldo. However, a recent increase has sent the population to 100,502 residents.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}
