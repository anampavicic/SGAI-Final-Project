It is divided into four provinces: [[Province of L'Aquila|L'Aquila]], [[Province of Teramo|Teramo]], [[Province of Pescara|Pescara]], and [[Province of Chieti|Chieti]]. Its western border lies {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=on}} east of [[Rome]]. Abruzzo borders the region of [[Marche]] to the north, [[Lazio]] to the west and north-west, [[Molise]] to the south and the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the east. Geographically, Abruzzo is divided into a mountainous area in the west, which includes the highest massifs of the [[Apennines]], such as the [[Gran Sasso d'Italia]] and the [[Maiella]], and a coastal area in the east with beaches on the [[Adriatic Sea]].

Abruzzo is considered a region of [[Southern Italy]] in terms of its culture, language, economy, and history, though in terms of physical geography, it may also be considered part of [[Central Italy]].<ref name="Felice">Paradosso evidenziato da [[Ignazio Silone]], cfr. {{cite book | author=Costantino Felice | title=Le trappole dell'identità: l'Abruzzo, le catastrofi, l'Italia di oggi | year=2010 | editor=Donzelli | location=Rome | chapter=Quadri ambientali e identità regionale | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KmB44oQjNcC&pg=PA85 | page=41 | isbn=978-88-6036-436-4 |publisher=Donzelli }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The Italian Statistical Authority ([[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]]) deems it to be part of Southern Italy, partly because of Abruzzo's historic association with the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]].<ref name="Felice" />

===Politics===
{{Main|Politics of Abruzzo}}
Abruzzo is governed as a [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy]] with a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the regional government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the regional council.

The regional government (''Giunta regionale'') is presided over by the president of the region (''presidente della Regione'') who is elected for a five-year term. The government is composed of the president and eight ministers (''assessori''), including a vice president (''vicepresidente'') and an undersecretary (''sottosegretario'').<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.regione.abruzzo.it/portale/index.asp?modello=giunta&servizio=lista&stileDiv=mono&template=default&b=giunta |title=Regione Abruzzo – Giunta Regionale |access-date=28 February 2023 |archive-date=9 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209210022/http://www.regione.abruzzo.it/portale/index.asp?modello=giunta&servizio=lista&stileDiv=mono&template=default&b=giunta |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Prehistory ===
==== Paleolithic ====
Although an earlier presence cannot be ruled out, findings in the region related to [[archaic humans]] date from up to around 700,000 years ago ([[Acheulean Culture]]). Thousands of [[flint]] [[stone tool|tools]] and [[weapons]] have been collected on [[fluvial terrace|fluvial terraces]] (e.g. Madonna del Freddo at [[Chieti]]) and near [[lake#Paleolakes|former lakes]] (e.g. Valle Giumentina at [[Caramanico Terme]] and [[Valle Peligna]] at [[Popoli]]). These testify to the presence of different [[Homo]] species over time, ranging from [[Homo erectus]] and [[Neanderthal|Neanderthals]] to modern humans. A site located at [[Popoli]] (Svolte di Popoli) also contained animal bones, which in that case was of a [[hippopotamus]]. The most important evidence of [[Neanderthals]] presence in the region was found in caves in [[Calascio]] and dates back to the [[Middle Paleolithic]].<ref name=museo>{{cite AV media|title=The People Of Abruzzo And Their Millennia Of History|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbDu_cBBCnc|access-date=29 September 2024|publisher=[[Museo delle Genti d'Abruzzo]]}}</ref>

Significant evidence of [[Upper Paleolithic]] [[human]] populations has been found in various places, including the [[Fucine Lake|Fucino]] [[depression (geology)|depression]] and [[Montebello di Bertona]], the latter giving its name to a distinctive [[stoneworking]] technique called "Bertonian".<ref>{{treccani|facies-bertoniana|Facies Bertoniana}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference|last1=Tozzi|first1=Carlo|date=September 2001|title=Preistoria e protostoria dell'Abruzzo|language=IT|trans-title=Prehistory and protohistory of Abruzzo|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284631974|location=Chieti|publisher=Istituto italiano di preistoria e protostoria|access-date=8 March 2024}}</ref><ref name=Sapere.it>{{cite web|url=http://www.sapere.it/enciclopedia/Abruzzo+o+Abruzzi.html|title=Abruzzo o Abruzzi|website=Sapere.it|date=5 June 2020|publisher=[[De Agostini]]|language=IT|access-date=March 3, 2024|archive-date=7 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230407053624/https://www.sapere.it/enciclopedia/Abruzzo+o+Abruzzi.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=Treccani>{{treccani|abruzzo|Abruzzo}}</ref>

==== Neolithic ====
After the [[Mesolithic]] transition, which was characterized by [[climate variability and change|climate change]] and a lack of food resources, [[agriculture]] was introduced in Abruzzo by [[Early European Farmers|Neolithic farmers]] from the [[Middle East]]. A skeleton from Lama dei Peligni in the [[province of Chieti]] was dated back to 6,540 BC using radiometric dating.<ref>[[Journal of Anthropological Sciences]], "Towards a re-appraisal of the Early Neolithic skeleton from Lama dei Peligni (Abruzzo, Italy)" by Miliano Bruner and Giorgio Manzi, Vol. 81 (2003), pp. 69–78 (Abruzzo, Italy)</ref>

In Abruzzo and [[Marche]], [[villages]] typical of {{ill|Ripoli culture|it|Cultura di Ripoli}} in the [[5th millennium BC|5]]–[[6th millennium BC]] consisted of [[huts]], and were generally located on [[fluvial terrace|fluvial terraces]] or [[hills]] overlooking [[rivers]]. In some cases they were defended by a [[moat]]. [[Caves]] were often used for [[rituals]]. They practiced [[agriculture]], [[husbandry]], [[hunting]], [[fishing]], and production of [[pottery]], which was painted or decorated.<ref>{{treccani|ripoli|Ripoli}}</ref><ref>{{treccani|repertorio-delle-culture-dell-europa-preistorica-neolitico_(Il-Mondo-dell'Archeologia)|Repertorio delle culture dell'Europa preistorica. Neolitico|Renata Grifoni Cremonesi|2004}}</ref> Other older Neolithic cultures present in Abruzzo are called Impressed Ceramic and [[Catignano]].<ref name=Sapere.it/><ref name=Treccani/><ref name=museo/>

==== Metal Ages ====
The [[Bronze Age]] saw the spread of [[Apennine culture]] and Subapennine culture in central-[[southern Italy]], including in Abruzzo. The former has been associated with [[pastoralism]], and the latter with [[agriculture]].<ref>{{treccani|appennico|Appenninico}}</ref><ref>{{treccani|subappennico|Subappenninico}}</ref> During the [[Late Bronze Age]], [[Proto-Villanovan culture]] emerged in Abruzzo.<ref>{{treccani|repertorio-delle-culture-dell-europa-preistorica-eta-del-bronzo_(Il-Mondo-dell'Archeologia)/|Repertorio delle culture dell'Europa preistorica. Età del Bronzo|Maria Antonietta Fugazzola Delpino|2004}}</ref>

There are sites of [[Iron Age]] [[necropolis|necropoli]] at Fiorano ([[Loreto Aprutino]]'s ''[[frazione]]''), Campovalano ([[Campli]]), [[Alfedena]] and [[Capestrano]].<ref name=Sapere.it/><ref name=Treccani/><ref name=museo/>

=== Ancient history ===
{{See also|Italic peoples|Roman expansion in Italy|Roman Italy}}
[[File:Guerriero di capestrano, da capestrano, 600-550 ac ca. 02.jpg|thumb|[[Warrior of Capestrano]] is the most famous example of Abruzzi [[Italic peoples|Italic]] funerary [[sculpture]] ([[Museo Archeologico Nazionale d'Abruzzo]], [[Chieti]]).]]
At the end of the [[Iron Age]], Abruzzo was inhabited by different tribes, including those defined by ancient Roman tradition as [[Sabelli]]:<ref>{{treccani|sabelli|Sabelli}}</ref> [[Oscan language|Oscan-speaking]] [[Pentri]], [[Caraceni (tribe)|Carricini]] and [[Frentani]], and, more generically, [[Osco-Umbrian languages|Osco-Umbrian]] [[Aequi]], [[Praetutii]], [[Vestini]], [[Marrucini]], [[Marsi]] and [[Peligni]].<ref name=Sapere.it/>

Considered strong warriors by [[Ancient history|ancient]] writers, they fought against the Romans in the [[Samnite Wars]] (from 343 to 290 BC). Some tribes accepted the alliance with the Romans, whereas others surrendered after the Samnite Wars. Following progressive [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]], they supported the Romans and contributed to many victories in the [[3rd century BC|3rd]] and [[2nd century BC|2nd centuries BC]].<ref>{{treccani|popoli-e-culture-dell-italia-preromana-i-popoli-dell-area-medio-adriatica_(Il-Mondo-dell'Archeologia)|Popoli e culture dell'Italia preromana. I popoli dell'area medio-adriatica|Gianluca Tagliamonte|2004}}</ref> They fought again with Rome during the [[Social War (91–87 BC)]] to gain [[political rights]] and created the ephemeral state called Italia with [[Corfinio]] as the capital. After the Social War, they obtained [[Roman citizenship]]<ref>{{treccani|guerre-sociali|Guerre sociali}}</ref> and in the [[Roman Empire|Imperial]] period favoured economic activities such as [[trade]] and [[pastoralism]].<ref name=Sapere.it/> On the basis of a [[Roman Italy#Augustan organization|division]] by [[Augustus]], the territory of what is now Abruzzo was part of "Regio V [[Picenum]]" and especially "Regio IV [[Sabina (region)|Sabina]] et [[Samnium]]". Much later, the region corresponded to the Valeria province, according to [[Diocletian]] decisions, and was among the first to see the arrival of [[Christianity]].<ref name=Italiana>{{treccani|abruzzo_(Enciclopedia-Italiana)|Abruzzo|Cesare Rivera, Roberto Amalgia, Camillo Giulio Bertoni, Ugo Antonielli, Ignazio Carlo Gavini, Giulio Fara|1929}}</ref><ref name=medievale>{{treccani|abruzzo_(Enciclopedia-dell'-Arte-Medievale)|Abruzzo|M.

Il Mondo dell'Archeologia (2004)|Manlio Lilli|2004}}</ref>

Evidence from archeological sites shows that many cities in Abruzzo date back to ancient times. [[Corfinio]] was known as Corfinium when it was the chief city of the [[Paeligni]], and it became the capital of "Italia" against the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] during the [[Social War (91–87 BC)|Social War]].<ref>{{treccani|corfinium_(Enciclopedia-dell'-Arte-Antica)|Corfinium}}</ref> Today's [[Chieti]] has been inhabited since the [[Chalcolithic]] era, and was an important center of [[Marrucini]] (Teate Marrucinorum).<ref>{{treccani|teate-marrucinorum_(Enciclopedia-dell'-Arte-Antica)|Teate Marrucinorum|1997}}</ref> [[Atri, Abruzzo|Atri]] was known as Hatria<ref>{{treccani|atri|Atri}}</ref> and [[Teramo]] was known variously in ancient times as Interamnia and Teramne.<ref>{{treccani|teramo|Guerre|Teramo}}</ref> Pinna (today [[Penne, Abruzzo|Penne]]), Anxanum ([[Lanciano]]), Hortona ([[Ortona]]), Histonium ([[Vasto]]), [[Sulmona]] and Marruvium ([[San Benedetto dei Marsi]]) are among the settlements that are still inhabited, while others are no longer so, such as Cluviae near [[Casoli]].<ref>{{treccani|l-italia-romana-delle-regiones-regio-iv-sabina-et-samnium_(Il-Mondo-dell'Archeologia)|L'Italia romana delle Regiones. Regio IV Sabina et Samnium|Andrea R. Staffa|2004}}</ref>

=== Middle Ages ===
The region was known as Aprutium in the Middle Ages and, according to a hypothesis, it is a combination of Praetutium, or rather of the name of the people, Praetutii, applied to their chief city, Interamnia, the old [[Teramo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.comuni-italiani.it/13/|title=Italy Guide: Abruzzo Region|work=Comuni-Italiani.it|access-date=20 January 2014|archive-date=17 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217005917/http://en.comuni-italiani.it/13/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Early Middle Ages ====
{{See also|Ostrogothic Kingdom|Byzantine Italy|Kingdom of the Lombards|Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)}}
After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] and the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic War]] between the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]],<ref name=museo/> [[looting]] and devastation of [[monasteries]] and [[towns]] followed the arrival of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Lombards]] in the region. Around 572, the [[Lombards]] divided Abruzzo into the [[Duchy of Benevento]] and of [[Duchy of Spoleto|Spoleto]], with [[Faroald I of Spoleto]] becoming the first [[Duke of Spoleto]]. His successor, [[Ariulf of Spoleto]], annexed other territories: the former territories controlled by [[Aequi]], [[Marsi]], [[Peligni]] and [[Vestini]]. In the [[8th century]], [[Transamund II of Spoleto]] rebelled against [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards]], but was able to recover his duchy and also to include other remaining territories of former Valeria province.

After the beginning of domination by the [[Franks]], in 801, Teate (today's [[Chieti]]) also passed from the [[Lombards|Lombardic]] [[Duchy of Benevento]] to the Frankish [[Duchy of Spoleto]]. In 843, some territories were separated from the duchy (all the region together with the district of [[Rieti]] and except that of [[Teramo]] according to ''Liber provincialis''), with [[Celano]] as capital. So [[counts of Marsi]] from different lineages ruled "Marsia" from 843 to 926. In 871, [[Louis II of Italy]] founded, as the [[Carolingian Emperor]], a monastery, which would become very powerful in the history of Abruzzo ([[Abbey of San Clemente a Casauria]]). With the rule of [[Hugh of Italy]] from 926, the territories were divided: [[Penne, Abruzzo|Penne]] and [[Chieti|Teate]] to {{ill|Atto I|it|Gastaldato di Teate}}, and today's [[province of L'Aquila]] to [[Counts of Marsi|Berardo]].

==== Kingdom of Sicily ====
{{See also|Kingdom of Sicily|Norman conquest of southern Italy|Hohenstaufen#Ruling in Italy|Capetian House of Anjou}}
After two attempted conquests from two [[Normans|Norman]] [[Principality of Capua|princes of Capua]] in Abruzzo, two other Normans, [[Robert Guiscard]] and [[Robert I of Loritello]], conquered [[Chieti|Teate]], [[Corfinio|Valva]] and [[Penne, Abruzzo|Penne]]. Later, all Abruzzo was definitively conquered by [[Normans|Norman]] [[Roger II of Sicily]], and in 1156 his son [[William I of Sicily]] had these victories officially recognized by [[Pope Adrian IV]]. 

As part of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], Abruzzo was involved in the conflicts following the death of [[William II of Sicily]] in 1189, and the territories sided with [[Constance, Queen of Sicily]] and [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor]], but after the death of the former in 1198, they were invaded by [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]. They were also involved in the conflicts between [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] (son of [[Constance, Queen of Sicily|Queen Costance]]) and [[Pope Gregory IX]], including the [[War of the Keys]].<ref name=Italiana/><ref name=Sapere.it/> The administrative region of Abruzzo was formed in the 1230s, when [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] divided his realms into [[justiciarate]]s, with Abruzzo forming one of them.<ref name="Wine">{{cite web |url=http://winecountry.it/regions/abruzzo/ |title=WineCountry.it Abruzzo wine region of Italy |publisher=winecountry.it |access-date=8 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331103332/http://winecountry.it/regions/abruzzo/ |archive-date=31 March 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> 

The newly founded [[L'Aquila]] was destroyed by [[Manfred, King of Sicily]] (son of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]) in 1259, and supported in the [[Battle of Tagliacozzo]] (1268) the defeat of his nephew [[Conradin]] against [[Charles I of Anjou]], the new [[king of Sicily]].

[[File:Castello Caldoresco di Vasto - anteriore.JPG|thumb|[[Castello Caldoresco]], [[Vasto]]]]
After the rebellion called [[Sicilian Vespers]] and the [[War of the Sicilian Vespers|subsequent war]], in 1302 the [[Peace of Caltabellotta]] divided the former [[Kingdom of Sicily]] as follows: [[Sicily]] to the [[Crown of Aragon]] and the [[Southern Italy|Southern]] [[Italian Peninsula]] (including Abruzzo) still to the [[Capetian House of Anjou]].

The region was profoundly affected during the wars that followed a conspiracy which resulted in the [[Andrew, Duke of Calabria#Murder and aftermath|assassination of Andrew, Duke of Calabria]], the husband of Queen [[Joanna I of Naples]]. Different towns ([[L'Aquila]], [[Penne]], [[Chieti]], [[Lanciano]], [[Ortona]]) sided at first with the brother of the victim, [[Louis I of Hungary]]. In 1443, [[Alfonso V of Aragon]], [[King of Sicily]], conquered the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. In the same years, Abruzzo saw many battles, including the ones associated with the [[War of L'Aquila]]. Under the Aragonese rulers, [[L'Aquila]] started to become a military center, giving up its political and economic importance to [[Chieti]]. This period was characterized by economic decline and the spread of [[brigandage]], but coastal centers were favored by trade with the [[Republic of Venice]]'s overseas territories.

Shortly after the [[Italian War of 1494–1495]] carried out by [[Charles VIII of France]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]] returned to [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]. In this and in the following conflict between the [[Kingdom of France]] and the [[Kingdom of Spain]] over the [[Kingdom of Naples]], Abruzzo sided with France, but Spain won in 1503 and started to dominate the [[Kingdom of Naples]] with its [[viceroys]].

In Abruzzo, the aristocracy vainly tried to regain more control when there was a [[Neapolitan Republic (1647–1648)|rebellion in the Kingdom of Naples]] led by a [[fisherman]] named [[Masaniello]] in 1647.

At the beginning of the 18th century, the region was affected by destructive earthquakes, which also devastated [[L'Aquila]] ([[1703 Apennine earthquakes]]) and [[Sulmona]] ([[1706 Abruzzo earthquake]]), and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], with the [[Austria|Austrian]] siege at [[Pescara]] in 1707. In 1734, [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] of the [[ House of Bourbon]], King of Spain, ended the short [[Habsburg monarchy|Hasburg Austrian]] domination, which contributed to [[Concentration of land ownership|large land concentrations]] in Abruzzo.<ref name=Sapere.it/><ref name="auto2">{{treccani|regno-di-napoli_(Dizionario-di-Storia)|Regno di Napoli|2010}}</ref><ref name=Italiana/>

=== French invasions ===
{{See also|French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars}}
[[File:Ferdinando Galiani.png|thumb|[[Ferdinando Galiani]], an 18th-century [[monetary economics|monetary economist]] from Abruzzo]]
In accordance with a general diffidence against the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas, the Abruzzo population of different [[social class|social classes]] rebelled in an improvised way against [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|French invasion]] in 1798 and 1799. After the proclamation of the ephemeral [[Parthenopean Republic]], they continued to be hostile to French invaders (''[[Sanfedismo]]'').<ref name=Italiana/>

During the [[Kingdom of Naples (Napoleonic)|client kingdom]] (1806 - 1815) of [[Napoleon]], in 1806, Abruzzo Ultra was divided into two, as Abruzzo Ultra I and Abruzzo Ultra II (being divided at the [[Gran Sasso d'Italia]]); the same Citra/Ultra I/Ultra II scheme was used for Calabria.

=== Kingdom of Two Sicilies ===
{{See also|Kingdom of the Two Sicilies}}
The return of the [[Bourbons]] was granted by the [[Congress of Vienna]], while Abruzzo was plagued by decline and [[brigandage]]. The [[House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies]] established the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] in 1816, and ruled until [[Italian unification]] (also known as the ''Risorgimento'').<ref name=regions>{{Cite book |title=The regions of Italy; a reference guide |last=Domenico |first=Roy Palmer |publisher=Greenwood |year=2002 |pages=4}}</ref><ref name=Italiana/>

=== Italian unification ===
{{See also|Italian unification}}
Many rebelled again in 1821, 1841 and 1848 ([[Revolutions of 1848]]), but the ideologies of insurgents were different, and included [[Liberalism|liberal]], [[Jacobins|Jacobin]], or [[reactionary]] ideas. During the [[unification of Italy]], in 1860, Abruzzo became part of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and, in 1861, the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. Some supporters of the [[Bourbons]] fought against volunteers of [[Garibaldi]], and later banded with simple criminals to participate for political reasons in [[brigandage]], which would be eradicated years later. However, many accepted the new order without enthusiasm or opposition.<ref name=Italiana/>

Since 1870, due to its economic conditions, Abruzzo saw massive emigration to other regions and countries, which contributed to [[Italian diaspora]].<ref name=Sapere.it/>

=== Fascism and World War II ===
During the [[Italian fascism]] period, [[Pescara]] became an important center for its [[Port of Pescara|homonymous port]], [[tourism]] and [[trade]].<ref name=Sapere.it/> With the [[Second World War]], Abruzzo was on the [[Gustav Line]], part of the German [[Winter Line]]. One of the most brutal battles was the [[Battle of Ortona]]. Abruzzo was the location of two [[List of World War II prisoner-of-war camps in Italy|prisoners of war camps]], Campo 21 in Chieti,<ref>{{Cite book|title=An extraordinary Italian imprisonment : the brutal truth of Campo 21, 1942–3|last=Lett|first=Brian|publisher=Pen and Sword|year=2014|location=Barnsley}}</ref> and Campo 78 in Sulmona. The Sulmona camp also served as a POW camp in [[World War I]]; much of the facility is still intact and attracts tourists interested in [[military history]].

=== Italian Republic ===
Despite the high level of destructions and victims caused by the [[Second World War]], there was remarkable development in the second half of the 20th century, which particularly favored [[Fucino]] and [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] [[coast|coastal]] areas.<ref name=Sapere.it/>

In the 1948 [[Italian Constitution]], these were unified with Molise into the [[Abruzzi e Molise]] region, though in the first draft Abruzzo and Molise were separate, and in 1963 Abruzzi e Molise was separated into the two regions of Abruzzo and Molise. Abruzzo Citeriore is now the [[province of Chieti]]. The [[province of Teramo]] and [[province of Pescara]] now comprise what was Abruzzo Ulteriore I. Abruzzo Ulteriore II is now the [[province of L'Aquila]].

==Geography==
Geographically, Abruzzo is nearly at the center of [[Italian peninsula]], stretching from the heart of the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] to the [[Adriatic Sea]], and includes mainly mountainous and wild land. The mountainous land is occupied by a vast plateau, including [[Gran Sasso]], at {{convert|2912|m|ft}} the highest peak of the Apennines, and [[Majella|Mount Majella]] at {{convert|2793|m|ft}}. The [[Adriatic]] coastline is characterized by long sandy beaches to the North and pebbly beaches to the South. Abruzzo is well known for its landscapes and natural environment, parks and nature reserves, characteristic hillside areas rich in vineyards and olive groves. Many beaches have been awarded the [[Blue Flag beach]] status.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.abruzzoturismo.it/img/depliant/en_AmbienteNatura.pdf | title=Abruzzo | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201215720/http://www.abruzzoturismo.it/img/depliant/en_AmbienteNatura.pdf | archive-date=1 February 2014| url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Climate===
[[File:Lungomare giulianova.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Giulianova]] seaside]]

In Abruzzo there are two climatic zones. The coastal strip and [[sub-Apennine]] hills have a climate markedly different from that of the mountainous interior. Coastal areas have a [[Mediterranean]] climate with hot dry summers and mild winters. Inland hilly areas have a [[Supralittoral zone|sublittoral]] climate with temperatures decreasing progressively with increasing altitude.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lifeinabruzzo.com/abruzzo-annual-weather-forecast/ | title=Abruzzo Annual Weather Forecast | work=Life in Abruzzo | date=17 August 2008 | access-date=15 August 2016 | author=Sam Dunham | archive-date=27 August 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827022853/http://www.lifeinabruzzo.com/abruzzo-annual-weather-forecast/ | url-status=live }}</ref> Precipitation is also strongly affected by the presence of the Apennines mountain range. Rainfall is abundant on slopes oriented to the west, and lower in east and east-facing slopes. The Adriatic coast is shielded from rainfall by the barrier effect created by the Apennines.<ref name="centrometeo">{{Cite web|url=http://www.centrometeo.com/articoli-reportage-approfondimenti/climatologia/5427-clima-abruzzo|title=Il clima della regione Abruzzo e tabelle climatiche per alcune località|website=www.centrometeo.com|access-date=28 February 2023|archive-date=28 February 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230228151504/http://www.centrometeo.com/articoli-reportage-approfondimenti/climatologia/5427-clima-abruzzo|url-status=live}}</ref> The minimum annual rainfall is found in some inland valleys, sheltered by mountain ranges, such as Peligna or Tirino ([[Ofena]], [[Capestrano]]), where as little as {{convert|500|mm|1|abbr=off}} were recorded. Rainfall along the coast almost always never falls below {{convert|600|mm|1|abbr=off}}. [[Pescara]] has relatively less rainfall (about {{convert|700|mm|1|abbr=off}}) than [[Chieti]] (about {{convert|1000|mm|1|abbr=off}}).<ref name="centrometeo" /> The highest rainfall occurs in upland areas on the border with [[Lazio]]; they are especially vulnerable to [[Atlantic]] disturbances. Around {{convert|1500|to|2000|mm|0|abbr=off}} of precipitation is typical.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.moldrek.com/vacanze_abruzzo.htm|title=Le vacanze abruzzesi|website=www.moldrek.com|access-date=28 February 2023|archive-date=7 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230307133300/https://www.moldrek.com/vacanze_abruzzo.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

The flora of Abruzzo is typically Mediterranean. Along the coastal belt [[Mediterranean shrubland]] Is the dominant natural vegetation, with species including [[myrtus|myrtle]], [[ericaceae|heather]] and [[Pistacia lentiscus|mastic]]. Inland are found [[olive]], [[pine]], [[willow]], [[oak]], [[Populus|poplar]], [[alder]], [[arbutus]], [[broom]], [[acacia]], [[capers]], [[rosemary]], [[Common hawthorn|hawthorn]], [[licorice]] and [[almond]] trees, interspersed with [[oak]] trees. At elevations between {{convert|600|and|1000|m|ft}} there is [[sub-montane]] vegetation, with mixed woodlands of oak and turkey oak, maple and [[hornbeam]]; shrubs include [[dog rose]] and [[red juniper]]. Elevations between {{convert|1000|and|1900|m|ft}} are dominated by beech. In the [[Apennine Mountains]] at elevations above {{convert|2000|m|ft}} species include [[Chamorchis|alpine orchid]], mountain juniper, [[Abies alba|silver fir]], black cranberry and the Abruzzo [[edelweiss]].

The fauna of Abruzzo is very diverse, including the region's symbol, the Abruzzo chamois (''[[Rupicapra pyrenaica]] ornata''), which has recovered from near-extinction. Common species include [[Marsican brown bear]], [[Canis lupus italicus|Italian wolf]], deer, lynx, roe deer, snow vole, fox, porcupine, wild cat, wild boar, badger, otter, and viper.

The natural parks of the region are the [[Abruzzo National Park]], the [[Gran Sasso and Monti della Laga National Park]], the [[Maiella National Park]] and the [[Sirente-Velino Regional Park]], as well as many other natural reserves and protected areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.regione.abruzzo.it/content/parchi|title=Parchi|date=4 May 2018|access-date=|website=Regione Abruzzo|language=it|archive-date=28 February 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230228153158/https://www.regione.abruzzo.it/content/parchi|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2017, the ancient beech forests of the Abruzzo Lazio and Molise National Park of Europe were recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, with the region thus gaining its first prestigious site.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ilcapoluogo.it/2017/07/09/le-faggete-abruzzesi-patrimonio-dellunesco/ | title=Le faggete abruzzesi patrimonio dell'Unesco | date=9 July 2017 | work=Il Capoluogo | language=it | access-date=10 August 2022 | archive-date=10 August 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220810122239/https://www.ilcapoluogo.it/2017/07/09/le-faggete-abruzzesi-patrimonio-dellunesco/ | url-status=live }}</ref>

Until a few decades ago, Abruzzo was a backward region of [[Southern Italy]]. Since the 1950s, Abruzzo has showed steady economic growth. In 1951, per capita income or GDP was 53% of that of wealthier [[Northern Italy]]. The gap has since narrowed, being 65% in 1971 and 76% by 1994.

=== Industry ===
[[Image:Pastificio De Cecco, Fara San Martino.jpg|thumb|right|[[De Cecco]] factory in Fara San Martino]]

From the early 1950s to the mid-1990s, Abruzzo's industrial sector expanded rapidly, especially in [[mechanical engineering]], transportation equipment and telecommunications.<ref name="eib.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.eib.org/attachments/efs/eibpapers/eibpapers_2000_v05_n01/eibpapers_2000_v05_n01_a03_en.pdf |title=Abruzzo and Sicily: Catching up and lagging behind, EIB Papers vol. 5, No. 1 (2000) |access-date=22 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327082206/http://www.eib.org/attachments/efs/eibpapers/eibpapers_2000_v05_n01/eibpapers_2000_v05_n01_a03_en.pdf |archive-date=27 March 2009 }}</ref> The structure of production in the region reflects the transformation of the economy from agriculture to industry and services. The industrial sector relies on few large enterprises and the predominance of small and medium enterprises. In the [[research|applied research]] field, there are major institutes and enterprises involved in the fields of [[pharmaceutics]], [[biomedicine]], [[electronics]], [[aerospace]] and [[nuclear physics]]. The industrial infrastructure is dispersed throughout the region in industrial zones. The most important of these are: Val Pescara, Val di Sangro, Val Trigno, Val Vibrata and Conca del Fucino.

The [[province of Teramo]] is one of the most industrialized areas of Italy and of the region, with numerous small and medium-sized companies,<ref>[http://ricerca.gelocal.it/ilcentro/archive/ilcentro/2008/02/04/CR2PO_CR201.html Abruzzo, the number of companies grows]</ref> then follows the [[province of Chieti]] and that of [[Pescara]], which is also supported by [[tourism]]; the Val Vibrata ([[province of Teramo]]), on the border with the [[Marche]] region, is home to a myriad of small and medium-sized enterprises, especially in the textile and footwear sectors. The Val di Sangro (province of Chieti), on the other hand, is home to important multinationals and a factory belonging to the [[Fiat]] ([[Sevel]]) group. The area of [[Valle Peligna]] (province of L'Aquila) is also home to industries (the famous one of [[Sulmona]] sugared almonds), while other areas such as Pescara and Theatine are home to numerous industries, including multinationals (for example [[De Cecco]], [[Procter & Gamble]], Monti & Ambrosini Editori, Brioni, Ennedue and [[Miss Sixty]], mostly concentrated in the industrial district of Val Pescara in the province of Chieti).

===Agriculture===
[[File:Centerba.jpg|right|thumb|[[Centerba]], typical liquor of Abruzzo]]
Agriculture, based on small holdings, has modernised and produces high-quality products. The mostly small-scale producers are active in wine, [[cereal]]s, [[sugar beet]], potatoes, olives, vegetables, fruit and [[dairy product]]s. Traditional products are [[saffron]] and [[liquorice]]. By the late 20th and early 21st centuries, [[Montepulciano d'Abruzzo]], the region's most famous wine, had become one of the most widely exported DOC-classed wines in Italy.<ref name="Vino Italiano">J. Bastianich & D. Lynch ''Vino Italiano'' pg 280–283 Crown Publishing 2005 {{ISBN|1-4000-9774-6}}</ref>

The region produces about 850,000 [[quintal]]s of fruit, 5 million quintals of vegetables, 1,600,000 quintals of potatoes, and 5,000,000 quintals of grapes, produced both for eating and for winemaking; the latter is estimated at between 3 and 4 million hectoliters, with the production of wines such as [[Montepulciano d'Abruzzo]] in the red and cerasuolo (rosé) varieties, [[Trebbiano d'Abruzzo]], Pecorino and the Chardonnay; oil production, on the other hand, stands at 1,350,000 quintals of olives and 240,000 quintals of [[cooking oil|oil]] (''Aprutino Pescarese'', ''Pretuziano delle Colline Teramane'' and ''Colline Teatine''), figures that put Abruzzo in sixth place among the Italian regions; as regards cereals, the [[durum wheat]] with over 1.5 million quintals constitutes the main cereal, followed by [[soft wheat]] (one million quintals), then [[Hordeum vulgare|barley]] (0.5 million quintals ); other crops are also grown, among them [[beetroot]] (2,500,000 quintals), and [[tobacco]] (45,000 quintals).{{CN|date=May 2023}}

Although the population density of Abruzzo has increased over recent decades, it is still well below the Italian national average: in 2008, 123.4 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>, compared to 198.8. In the provinces, the density varies: {{As of|2008|lc=y}} [[Province of Pescara|Pescara]] is the most densely populated with 260.1 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>, whereas L'Aquila is the least densely populated with 61.3 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>, although it has the largest area. After decades of emigration from the region, the main feature of the 1980s is immigration from third world countries. The population increase is due to the positive net migration. Since 1991 more deaths than births were registered in Abruzzo (except for 1999, when their numbers were equal).<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/index.htm |title=Eurostat |publisher=Europa (web portal) |access-date=22 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201175658/http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/index.htm |archive-date=1 February 2009 }}</ref> In 2008, the Italian [[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|national institute of statistics]] ISTAT estimated that 59,749 foreign-born immigrants live in Abruzzo, equal to 4.5% of the total regional population.

The most serious demographic imbalance is between the mountainous areas of the interior and the coastal strip. The largest province, L'Aquila, is situated entirely in the interior and has the lowest population density. The movement of the population of Abruzzo from the mountains to the sea has led to the almost complete urbanization of the entire coastal strip especially in the [[province of Teramo]] and Chieti. The effects on the interior have been impoverishment and demographic aging, reflected by an activity rate in the province of L'Aquila which is the lowest among the provinces in Abruzzo – accompanied by geological degradation as a result of the absence of conservation measures. In the coastal strip, however, there is such a jumble of accommodations and activities that the environment has been negatively affected. The policy of providing incentives for development has resulted in the setting-up of industrial zones, some of which ([[Vasto]], [[Avezzano]], [[Carsoli]], [[Gissi]], [[Val Vibrata]], Val di Sangro) have made genuine progress, while others ([[Val Pescara]], [[L'Aquila]]) have run into trouble after their initial success. The zones of [[Sulmona]] and [[Guardiagrele]] have turned out to be more or less failures. Outside these zones, the main activities are agriculture and tourism.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

===Main settlements===
L'Aquila is both the capital city of the Abruzzo region and of the [[Province of L'Aquila]] and second largest city (pop. 73,000). L'Aquila was hit by an [[2009 L'Aquila earthquake|earthquake]] on 6 April 2009, which destroyed much of the city center. The other provincial capitals are [[Pescara]], which is Abruzzo's largest city and major port (pop. 123,000); [[Teramo]] (pop. 55,000) and [[Chieti]] (pop. 55,000). Other large municipalities in Abruzzo include the industrial and [[high tech]] center [[Avezzano]] (pop. 41,000), as well as three important industrial and touristic centers such as [[Vasto]] (pop. 40,636), [[Lanciano]] (pop. 36,000), and [[Sulmona]] (pop. 25,000).

=== Airports ===
*[[Abruzzo International Airport]] is the only international airport in the region. Open to civilian traffic since 1996, the number of passengers has increased over the years because of low-cost air carriers' use of the facility. Today, the airport has a catchment area of over 500,000 passengers annually.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abruzzoairport.com/default.aspx?lang=en |title=Abruzzo International Airport – flights information Pescara, Abruzzo, Italy |publisher=Abruzzoairport.com |access-date=12 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312111118/http://www.abruzzoairport.com/default.aspx?lang=en |archive-date=12 March 2013 }}</ref>
*[[L'Aquila-Preturo Airport]] is located near L'Aquila, but remains underused.

=== Ports ===

[[File:Marina di Pescara, December 2014.jpg|The [[port of Pescara]] | thumb | right]]
There are four main ports in Abruzzo: [[Port of Pescara|Pescara]], [[Ortona]], [[Vasto]] and [[Giulianova]].

Over the years, the Port of Pescara has become one of the most important tourist ports of Italy and the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Heavily damaged in World War II, it underwent major renovations for some sixty years. It now consists of a modern marina with advanced moorings and shipbuilding facilities. It has been awarded the [[European Union]]'s blue flag for its services. The port of Pescara has lost passenger traffic because of its shallowness and silting, but its fishery and [[aquaculture]] activities are thriving.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marinape.com/eng/index.aspx |title=Marina of Pescara |publisher=Marinape.com |date=31 January 2011 |access-date=12 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615044113/http://www.marinape.com/eng/index.aspx |archive-date=15 June 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Railways===
There is a significant disparity between the railways of the Abruzzo coast and the inland areas, which badly need modernization to improve the service, in particular, the [[Rome]]-[[Pescara]] line.

Existing railway lines:

* [[Adriatic railway]] runs through the whole of Italy from north to south, along the Adriatic Sea.<!-- The question that interests the Abruzzo region is included in the Towns of [[Martinsicuro]] and [[San Salvo]]. Unless, that delimit the borders with [[Marche]] and [[Molise]] regions, namely, the {{convert|113|km|2|abbr=on}} between the stations of intercurrent [[Alba Adriatica]]-[[Nereto]]-[[Controguerra]] and [[San Salvo]]. The interchanges are made by the respective railway lines [[Giulianova]], [[Teramo]] and Pescara-Rome.-->

There are three highways that serve the region:
* [[Autostrada A24 (Italy)|A24]] ([[Rome]] – [[L'Aquila]] – [[Teramo]]) was built in the 1970s and connects Rome with the Adriatic coast in less than two hour-drive. The [[Traforo del Gran Sasso|Gran Sasso tunnel]], the longest road tunnel entirely on Italian territory, was opened in 1984.

<!--Numerous roads connecting adjacent junction as directional Torano it branches in the [[Autostrada A25 (Italy)|A25]] to [[Pescara]], [[Teramo]] to [[Giulianova]] on SS80, SS81 to Chieti and on the [[Autostrada A14 (Italy)|A14]] [[Bologna]]-[[Taranto]], exit on the freeway Rieti Valley Jump -Terni, exit west on SS80 to L'Aquila-Teramo, near [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]] and the connection to the [[Autostrada A1 (Italy)|A1]] motorway allows easy connections with Naples and [[Milan]], the highway construction has contributed greatly to the economic development of the region.-->
* [[Autostrada A25 (Italy)|A25]] (Torano – Avezzano – Pescara) connects Rome with Pescara. The road branches off A24 in [[Torano di Borgorose|Torano]], spans across the [[Fucino]] basin, crosses the Apennines, and merges with [[Autostrada A14 (Italy)|A14]] near Pescara.

Before the 2009 earthquake, Abruzzo was the region with the highest number of castles and hill towns in Italy. It still holds many of Italy's best-preserved medieval and Renaissance hill towns, twenty-three of which are among ''[[I Borghi più belli d'Italia]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://borghipiubelliditalia.it/|title=Homepage|website=I Borghi più Belli d'Italia|access-date=15 June 2019|archive-date=16 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190916190502/https://borghipiubelliditalia.it/|url-status=live}}</ref> This listing recognises their scenic beauty, arts and culture, their historical importance and quality of life.

The abrupt decline of Abruzzo's agricultural economy in the early to mid-20th-century spared some of the region's historic hill towns from modern development. Many lie entirely within regional and [[national park]]s. Among the most well preserved are [[Castel del Monte (Abruzzo)|Castel del Monte]] and [[Santo Stefano di Sessanio]], within the [[Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park|Gran Sasso National Park]] on the edge of the high plain of [[Campo Imperatore]] and nestled beneath the Apennines' highest peaks. Both hill towns, which were ruled by the [[House of Medici|Medicis]] for over a century-and-a-half, see relatively little tourism. Between the two towns sits [[Rocca Calascio]], the ruin of an ancient fortress popular with filmmakers. Both [[Monteferrante]] and [[Roccascalegna]] are two of the most representative Abruzzo villages in the province of Chieti. Within the [[Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park|Gran Sasso National Park]] is also found [[Castelli (Teramo)|Castelli]], an ancient pottery center whose artisans produced ceramics for most of the [[dynasty|royal houses]] of Europe.

===Starter and main dishes===
* ''[[Spaghetti alla chitarra]]'' which is made by pressing or cutting [[pasta]] through a ''chitarra'', an implement to form long thin noodles similar to [[spaghetti]].

===Seafood===
[[Seafood]] is also popular, especially in coastal areas. The variety of fish available locally resulted in several fish-based ''[[Brudet|brodetti]]'' ("broths"), coming from such places as [[Vasto]], [[Giulianova]], and [[Pescara]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://lifeinabruzzo.com/brodetto-vastese-the-winding-barter-fish-soup/ | title=Brodetto Vastese – the Winding Barter Fish Soup | date=9 June 2012 | access-date=21 November 2022 | archive-date=20 November 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221120210345/https://lifeinabruzzo.com/brodetto-vastese-the-winding-barter-fish-soup/ | url-status=live }}</ref> These broths are often made by cooking fish, flavored with tomatoes, herbs, and peperoncino, in an earthenware pot.

===Pizzas===
Rustic pizzas are also very common. Some of these are:

* ''Easter pizza'', a rustic cake with cheese and pepper from the [[Teramo]] area
* ''Fiadoni'' from Chieti, a dough of eggs and cheese well risen, cooked in the oven in a thin casing of pastry
* A rustic tart pastry filled with everything imaginable: eggs, fresh cheeses, [[ricotta]], vegetables, and all sorts of flavorings and spices.

Also from Teramo are the spreadable sausages flavored with nutmeg, and liver sausages tasting of garlic and spices. Atri and [[Rivisondoli]] are famous for cheeses. [[Mozzarella]], either fresh or seasoned, is made from ewe's milk, although a great number of lesser known varieties of these cheeses can be found all over Abruzzo and Molise.

===Salumi===
''[[Salumi]]'' (singular: ''salume'') is an Italian term describing the preparation of cured meat products made predominantly from pork.
[[File:Mortadella di Campotosto.jpg|thumb|''[[Mortadella di Campotosto]]''|alt= Mortadella]]
Spreadable sausage flavored with nutmeg and liver sausage with garlic and spices are hallmarks of Teramo cuisine. ''[[Ventricina]]'' from the Vasto area is made with large pieces of fat and lean pork, pressed and seasoned with powdered sweet peppers and [[fennel]] and encased in dried pig stomach. ''[[Mortadella di Campotosto]]'' (well known in Abruzzo) is an oval, dark-red ''[[mortadella]]'' with a white column of fat. They are generally sold in pairs, tied together. Another name for the mortadella is ''coglioni di mulo'' (donkey's balls). It is made from shoulder and loin meat, [[prosciutto]] trimmings and fat. It is 80&nbsp;percent lean meat; 25 percent is prosciutto (ham), and 20 percent is ''[[pancetta]]''. The meat is minced and mixed with salt, pepper and white wine.

===Cheeses===
The region's principal [[cheese]]s are:

* ''Pecorino di Atri'', a compact, semi-cooked cheese made from sheep's milk, rennet and salt
* ''Pecorino di Farindola'', cheese made from sheep's milk and pork [[rennet]] (a special type of rennet, made by filling a dried pork stomach with vinegar and white wine for forty days)
