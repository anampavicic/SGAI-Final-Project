== History ==
The area around Komatsu was part of ancient [[Kaga Province]]. The area became part [[Kaga Domain]] under the [[Edo period]] [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. Komatsu housed the retirement castle of [[Maeda Toshitsune]]. While nearly all of the castle was demolished, its garden still remains as {{nihongo|Rojou Park|芦城公園||}}. In the spring, this is one of the prefecture's best spots for cherry blossom viewing. Following the [[Meiji restoration]], the area was organised into [[Nomi District, Ishikawa]]. The town of Komatsu was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Komatsu merged with surrounding municipalities to become a city on December 1, 1940.

==Government==
Komatsu has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city legislature of 22 members.

== Economy ==
Komatsu was traditionally known for the production of [[Kutani ware]] ceramics and for silk.<ref name=Japan>{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=Allen |last2=Nobel |first2=David S  |title=Japan: An Illustrated Encyclopedia |publisher=Kodansha |date=1993 |page=821 |isbn=406205938X}}</ref> [[Komatsu Limited]], the Japanese multinational construction and mining equipment corporation, was founded in Komatsu in 1921.
