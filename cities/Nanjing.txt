{{anchor|Name|Etymology|Toponymy}}

==Names==
The city has a number of other names, and some historical names are now used as names of districts of the city.

The city was known as '''Yuecheng''' and '''Jinling''' or "Ginling" ({{lang|zh-hant|金陵}}) from the Warring States Era. '''Jianye''' ({{zhi|t=建业|w=Chien-yeh}}), which means 'build an empire', was officially designated for the city during the [[Eastern Wu dynasty]]. The city first became a Chinese national capital as early as the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] and was renamed '''[[Jiankang]]'''. Nanjing is also called Jincheng ({{lang|zh|金城}}, Golden City), derived from Jinling City.

The name '''Nanjing''', which means "southern capital", was officially designated for the city during the [[Ming dynasty]], about six hundred years later.{{efn|Since becoming a southern capital, the city has been called Nanjing ({{lang|zh|南京}}) unofficially, and was officially named Nanjing after Beijing ({{lang|zh|北京}} became a capital city during the early [[Ming dynasty]]; the name appears in Ming dynasty echo poem ({{lang|zh-hant|蕭子顯 《奉和昭明太子鐘山講解詩》: "崇嶽基舊宇, 盤嶺跨南京"}}), for example. It's also unofficially called Nandu ({{lang|zh|南都}}), and Nandu Fanhui Tu ({{zh|labels=no |t=《南都繁會圖》 |l=Nandu Prosperity Picture}}) is an example.}}  In English, the spelling '''Nanking''' was traditional until [[pinyin]], developed in the 1950s and internationally adopted in the 1980s, standardized the spelling as "Nanjing".

During the [[Qing dynasty]], the city was called '''Jiangning''' ({{zhi|t=江寧|w=Kiang-ning}}), whose first character '''jiang''' ({{zh|t=江|p=jiāng|l=river}}, i.e. the [[Yangtze]]) is the former part of the name [[Jiangsu]] and second character '''ning''' ({{lang|zh-hant|寧}}, simplified form {{zh|labels=no|s=宁|l=peace}}) is the shortened name of Nanjing. When it was the capital of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)]], jing ({{zh|labels=no|c=京|l=capital}}) was adopted as the abbreviation of Nanjing.

===Early history===
[[File:Nanjing XuanWuLake Purple and Mountain.jpg|thumb|right|[[Purple Mountain (Nanjing)|Purple Mountain or Zijin Shan]], located to the east of the walled city of Nanjing, is the origin of the nickname "Jinling". The water in the front is [[Xuanwu Lake]]]]
Archaeological discovery shows that the so-called "[[Nanjing Man]]" lived more than 500,000 years ago. ''[[Zun]]'', a kind of wine vessel, were found to exist in Beiyinyangying culture of Nanjing about 5000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.163.com/13/1205/09/9FARCI7400014AED.html |script-title=zh:北阴阳营遗址上发现过酒器(组图)_网易新闻 |last=网易 |website=news.163.com |access-date=January 15, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128231158/http://news.163.com/13/1205/09/9FARCI7400014AED.html |archive-date=January 28, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> About 7000 years ago, there was an agricultural civilization in the area that is now [[Qixia District|Qixia]]. In the Jiangning district, ruins of primitive villages from the Neolithic Age were discovered.{{when|date=October 2023}}{{cn|date=October 2024}}

About 4000 years ago, dense [[Bronze Age]] primitive settlements appeared in the Qinhuai River Basin, labeled as the Hushu culture. The earliest cities in Nanjing were formed around these settlements. Due to the volume of archeological finds in the area related to the Taowu and Hushu cultures, many historians, anthropologists, and archeologists frequent the Nanjing area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huaxia.com/wh/kgfx/2007/00714504.html |script-title=zh:陶吴发现南京最大周代土墩墓(图) |website=huaxia.com |access-date=January 15, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022215319/http://www.huaxia.com/wh/kgfx/2007/00714504.html |archive-date=October 22, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Hushu culture developed into Wu culture under the influence of the Shang and Zhou, who encroached from Central Plains. From the traditions, [[Taibo of Wu|Taibo]] of [[Predynastic Zhou|Zhou]] came to [[Jiangnan]] and established the state of Wu during the 12th century BC.

In 571 BC, the [[State of Chu]] established Tangyi in Liuhe. This is the oldest extant administrative establishment in Nanjing; as of {{CURRENTYEAR}} it has a history {{#expr: 571 + {{CURRENTYEAR}}}} years long. In 541, [[Wu (state)|Wu]] built Laizhu Town in Gaochun—because of its strong city, it was also called Gucheng. [[Fuchai]], King of the [[Wu (state)|State of Wu]], founded a fort named Yecheng in today's Nanjing area in 495{{nbsp}}BC.<ref>({{lang|zh-hant|金陵在春秋時本吳地, 未有城邑.惟石頭城東有冶城.傳雲, 夫差冶鑄於此.即今朝天宮地.}}) {{lang|zh-hant|金陵古今圖考}} (''Illustrated Study of Past and Present Nanjing'')</ref>

Wu was conquered by the [[State of Yue]] in 473, and the city was rebuilt at the mouth of the Qinhuai River in the following year. Later it was called Yuecheng ({{lang|zh|越城}}) on the outskirts of the present-day [[Zhonghua Gate]], which was the beginning of the construction of the main city of Nanjing. In 333 BC, Chu defeated Yue and built Jinling Yi ({{lang|zh-hant|金陵邑}}) on in the western part of Nanjing.<ref>{{cite web |date=August 30, 2019 |script-title=zh:南京的古城邑及其考古發現: 金陵邑 |url=https://vitomag.com/history/n4vj33 |script-work=zh:南京考古 |access-date=April 10, 2020 |language=zh |archive-date=November 27, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221127212323/https://vitomag.com/history/n4vj33 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was the earliest administrative construction in the main city of Nanjing. The name of Jinling comes from this.

The area was successively part of [[Kuaiji Prefecture|Kuaiji]], [[Zhang Prefecture|Zhang]] and [[Danyang Prefecture|Danyang]] prefectures in Qin and Han dynasty, and part of Yangzhou region which was established as the nation's 13 supervisory and administrative regions in the 5th year of Yuanfeng in Han dynasty (106{{nbsp}}BC).{{cn|date=October 2024}} Nanjing was later the capital city of Danyang Prefecture, and had been the capital city of [[Yangzhou (ancient China)|Yangzhou]] for about 400 years from late [[Han dynasty|Han]] to early [[Tang dynasty|Tang]].{{cn|date=October 2024}}

[[Six Dynasties]] is a collective term for six Chinese dynasties mentioned above which all maintained national capitals at Jiankang. The six dynasties were: [[Eastern Wu]] (222–280), [[Eastern Jin dynasty]] (317–420) and [[Northern and Southern dynasties|four southern dynasties]] (420–589).

At the [[End of the Han dynasty|end of the Eastern Han dynasty]], the warlord [[Sun Quan]], who ruled [[Jiangnan|Jiangdong]], moved his ruling office to Moling in 211 AD. The following year, he built the [[Stone City (Nanjing)|Stone City]] at the site of Jinling Yi, and renamed Moling to Jianye. Jianye later became the capital of the [[Eastern Wu dynasty]] during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, after Sun Quan proclaimed himself emperor in 229, opening Nanjing's history as a state capital.<ref name="Crespigny 2004 loc=3" /> By the time Wu was conquered by the [[Western Jin dynasty]] in 280, Jianye and its neighboring areas had been well cultivated, developing into one of the commercial, cultural and political centers of China.<ref name="questia.com" />

Not long after the unification of China, the Western Jin collapsed under the weight of [[War of the Eight Princes|civil wars by eight princes]] and [[Upheaval of the Five Barbarians|rebellions]] from the so-called "[[Five Barbarians]]" in the north. Jianye, renamed to Jiankang in 313 to avoid [[Emperor Min of Jin|Emperor Min of Jin's]] [[Naming taboo|taboo name]], was safely isolated from the chaos and became a popular refuge for the northern nobles and wealthy families. In 318, the ruling prince in Jiankang, [[Sima Rui]] proclaimed himself the new emperor and reestablished the dynasty as the [[Eastern Jin|Eastern Jin dynasty]].<ref name="liu">Shufen Liu, "Jiankang and the Commercial Empire of the Southern Dynasties", in Pearce, Spiro, Ebrey eds. ''Culture and Power'', 2001:35.</ref> This marked the first time a Chinese dynastic capital was moved from the north to [[Northern and southern China|southern China]], as the north came under the rule of the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]].  

[[File:Pagoda at Qixia Temple Nanjing.jpg|upright|thumb|The [[Śarīra]] [[pagoda]] in [[Qixia Temple]]. It was built in AD{{nbsp}}601 and rebuilt in the 10th century.]]
Jiankang was the centre of administration in the south for more than two and a half centuries, even as China entered the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] period. After the Eastern Jin fell in 420, it continued to serve as the capital for the [[Southern dynasties]] of [[Liu Song dynasty|Liu Song]], [[Southern Qi]], [[Liang dynasty|Liang]] and [[Chen dynasty|Chen]]. During this time, Jiankang was the international hub of East Asia.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://njdfz.nje.cn/UpLoadFile/html/%E5%B8%82%E5%BF%971-4%E5%86%8C/html/ANoame002.html |script-chapter=zh:六朝名都崛起江东 |script-title=zh:南京市志(第1册) |access-date=May 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002051535/http://njdfz.nje.cn/UpLoadFile/html/%E5%B8%82%E5%BF%971-4%E5%86%8C/html/ANoame002.html |archive-date=October 2, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Based on historical documents, the city had 280,000 registered households.<ref>{{lang|zh-hans|《金陵记》}}: {{lang|zh-hans|"梁都之时, 城中二十八万户, 西至石头, 东至倪塘, 南至石子冈, 北过蒋山, 东西南北各四十里." }}{{in lang|zh-hans}}</ref> Assuming an average Nanjing household consisted of about 5.1 people, the city had more than 1.4&nbsp;million residents.<ref name="liu"/>

Having usurped power from his nephew and uncertain of the loyalty of the region's officials, the [[Yongle Emperor]] relocated the capital in 1421 to Beijing, where he had long served as the regional governor as the Prince of [[Yan (state)|Yan]]. Because the new status of Yingtian was included in the Hongwu Emperor's "[[Huang-Ming Zuxun|ancestral injunctions]]" for his dynasty, however, the Yongle Emperor [[filial piety|was obliged]] to preserve its special status, at least in name.  The "northern capital" came to be known as Beijing and the 'southern capital' as {{nowrap|Nanjing ({{zh|labels=no|c=南京}}).}} Both controlled territories "directly administered" by the emperor and his staff, [[Beizhili]] in the north and [[Nanzhili]] in the south.

Besides the city wall, other Ming-era structures in the city included the famous [[Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum]] and [[Porcelain Tower of Nanjing|Porcelain Tower]], although the latter was destroyed by the [[Taiping Rebellion|Taipings]] in the 19th century either to prevent a hostile faction from using it to observe and shell the city<ref>Jonathan D.

===Capital of the Southern Ming===
Over two centuries after the removal of the capital to Beijing, Nanjing was destined to become the capital of a Ming emperor one more time. After the fall of Beijing to [[Li Zicheng]]'s rebel forces and then to the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-led [[Qing dynasty]] in the spring of 1644, the Ming prince [[Zhu Yousong, Prince of Fu|Zhu Yousong]] was enthroned in Nanjing in June 1644 as the Hongguang Emperor.{{sfn|Wakeman|1985|p=346}}{{sfn|Struve|1988|p=644}} His short reign was described by later historians as the first reign of the so-called [[Southern Ming dynasty]].{{sfn|Struve|1988|p=642}}{{efn|The prince was a grandson of the [[Wanli Emperor]] (r. 1573–1620). The Wanli Emperor's attempt to name Zhu Yousong's father as heir apparent had been thwarted by supporters of the [[Donglin movement]] because Zhu Yousong's father was not the Wanli Emperor's eldest son. Although this was three generations earlier, Donglin officials in Nanjing nonetheless feared that the prince might retaliate against them.}}

Zhu Yousong, however, fared a lot worse than his ancestor Zhu Yuanzhang three centuries earlier. Beset by factional conflicts, his regime could not offer effective resistance to Qing forces, when the Qing army, led by the Manchu prince [[Dodo (prince)|Dodo]] approached [[Jiangnan]] the next spring.{{sfn|Struve|1993|pp=55–56}} Days after [[Yangzhou]] fell to the Manchus in late May 1645, the Hongguang Emperor fled Nanjing, and the imperial Ming Palace was looted by local residents.{{sfn|Struve|1993|pp=60–61}} On June 6, Dodo's troops approached Nanjing, and the commander of the city's garrison, Zhao the Earl of Xincheng, promptly surrendered the city to them.{{sfn|Struve|1993|pp=62–63}}{{sfn|Wakeman|1985|p=578}} The Manchus soon ordered all male residents of the city to shave their heads in the [[Queue (hairstyle)|Manchu queue way]].{{sfn|Wakeman|1985|p=647}}{{sfn|Struve|1988|p=662}}<ref>{{harvnb|Dennerline|2002|p=87}} (which calls this edict "the most untimely promulgation of [Dorgon's] career."</ref> They requisitioned a large section of the city for the [[Eight Banners|bannermen]]'s cantonment, and occupied the former imperial [[Ming Palace]], but otherwise the city was spared the mass murders and destruction that [[Yangzhou massacre|befell Yangzhou]].{{sfn|Struve|1993|pp=64–65, 72}}

Despite capturing many counties in his initial attack due to surprise and having the initiative, [[Koxinga]] announced the final battle in Nanjing in 1659 ahead of time giving plenty of time for the Qing to prepare because he wanted a decisive, single grand showdown as his father successfully did against the Dutch at the [[Battle of Liaoluo Bay]], throwing away the surprise and initiative which led to its failure. Koxinga's attack on Qing held Nanjing which would interrupt the supply route of the Grand Canal leading to possible starvation in Beijing caused such fear that the Manchus (Tartares) considered returning to Manchuria (Tartary) and abandoning China according to a 1671 account by a French missionary.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Ho |first=Dahpon David |year=2011 |title=Sealords live in vain : Fujian and the making of a maritime frontier in seventeenth-century China |type=A dissertation submitted in partial satisfaction of the requirements for the degree Doctor of Philosophy in History |publisher=UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO |pages=149–150 |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3pk3t096 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404092359/https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3pk3t096 |archive-date=April 4, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The commoners and officials in Beijing and Nanjing were waiting to support whichever side won.

The [[Xinhai Revolution]] led to the founding of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] in January 1912 with [[Sun Yat-sen]] as the first provisional president and Nanjing was selected as its new capital.{{cn|date=October 2024}} However, the Qing Empire controlled large regions to the north, so the revolutionaries asked [[Yuan Shikai]] to replace Sun as president in exchange for the abdication of [[Puyi]], the last emperor.

In 1927, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT; Nationalist Party) under Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]] again established Nanjing as the capital of the Republic of China, and this became internationally recognized once KMT forces took Beijing in 1928. The following decade is known as the [[Nanjing decade]]. During this decade, Nanjing was of symbolic and strategic importance. The Ming dynasty had made Nanjing a capital, the republic had been established there in 1912, and [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s provisional government had been there.{{cn|date=October 2024}} Sun's body was brought and placed in a [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum|grand mausoleum]] to cement Chiang's legitimacy.

Nanjing, with a total land area of {{cvt|6598|km2}}, is situated in the heartland of the [[drainage area]] of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and in the Yangtze River Delta, one of the largest economic zones of China. The Yangtze River flows past the west side and then the north side of Nanjing City, while the Ningzheng Ridge surrounds the north, east and south sides of the city. The city is {{cvt|650|km}} southeast of [[Luoyang]], {{cvt|900|km}} south-southeast of Beijing, {{cvt|270|km}} west-northwest of Shanghai, and {{cvt|1200|km}} east-northeast of [[Chongqing]]. The Yangtze River flows downstream from [[Jiujiang]], Jiangxi, through [[Anhui]] and Jiangsu to the East China Sea. The northern part of the lower Yangtze drainage basin is the [[Huai River]] basin and the southern part is the [[Zhe River]] basin; they are connected by the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] east of Nanjing. The area around Nanjing is called Xiajiang ({{lang|zh|下江}}, Downstream River) region, with [[Jianghuai]] dominant in the northern part and [[Wu (region)|Jiangzhe]] dominant in the southern part.{{efn|Huai (Huai of Jianghuai {{lang|zh|江淮}}) is a big river north of Jiang (the river [[Yangtze]]), and the Zhe (Zhe of Jiangzhe {{lang|zh|江浙}})) is a big river south of Jiang.}} The region is also well known as Dongnan ({{lang|zh|东南}}, South East, the Southeast) and [[Jiangnan]] ({{lang|zh|江南}}, and River South, South of Yangtze).{{efn|The areas covered by such geographical names as Jiangnan, Dongnan and Xiajiang are not precisely defined.

Sometimes the term Jianghai ({{lang|zh|江海}}) is used because the region is where the Jiang ([[Yangtze]], river) empties into the Hai (sea).}}

Nanjing borders [[Yangzhou]] to the northeast; [[Zhenjiang]] to the east; and [[Changzhou]] to the southeast. On its western boundary is [[Anhui]], where Nanjing borders five prefecture-level cities: [[Chuzhou]] to the northwest, [[Wuhu]], [[Chaohu]] and [[Ma'anshan]] to the west and [[Xuancheng]] to the southwest.<ref name="市志_市域">{{cite book |script-chapter=zh:中华人民共和国成立后中央直辖市及江苏省省会 |script-title=zh:南京市志(第1册)}}</ref>

Along with [[Chongqing]] and [[Wuhan]], Nanjing is traditionally referred to as one of the "[[Three Furnaces]]" along the Yangtze River for the perennially high temperatures in the summertime.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gzkp.org.cn/show.aspx?id=180&cid=5 |script-title=zh:为什么重庆、武汉、南京有"三大火炉"之称? |publisher=Guangzhou Popular Science News Net (广州科普资讯网) |language=zh-hans |date=September 12, 2007 |access-date=November 12, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112042247/http://www.gzkp.org.cn/show.aspx?id=180&cid=5 |archive-date=November 12, 2014 }}</ref> However, the time from mid-June to the end of July is the [[plum blossom]] blooming season in which the ''[[meiyu]]'' (rainy season of East Asia; literally "plum rain") occurs, during which the city experiences a period of mild rain as well as dampness. The northeast wind prevails in winter. The average temperature in January is {{cvt|3.1|C}}, and the extreme daily minimum temperature is {{cvt|-14.0|C}}, which occurred on January 6, 1955. The southeast wind prevails in summer, with an average temperature of {{cvt|28.4|C}} in July and an extreme daily maximum temperature of {{cvt|43.0|C}}, which occurred on July 13, 1934. The number of precipitation days greater than 0.1&nbsp;mm was 113 days, and the extreme maximum annual precipitation days were 160 days in 1957. The average annual precipitation is {{cvt|1144|mm}}.

Typhoons are uncommon but possible in the late stages of summer and early part of autumn. The annual mean temperature is around {{cvt|16.4|°C|1}}, with the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranging from {{cvt|3.1|°C|1}} in January to {{cvt|28.4|°C|1}} in July.

Nanjing is endowed with rich natural resources, which include more than 40 kinds of minerals. Among them, iron and [[sulfur]] reserves make up 40&nbsp;percent of those of Jiangsu province. Its reserves of [[strontium]] rank first in East Asia and the [[Southeast Asia]] region. Nanjing also possesses abundant water resources, both from the Yangtze River and groundwater. In addition, it has several natural hot springs such as Tangshan Hot Spring in [[Jiangning District|Jiangning]] and Tangquan Hot Spring in [[Pukou]].

Xuanwu Lake and Mochou Lake are located in the center of the city and are easily accessible to the public, while Purple Mountain is covered with deciduous and coniferous forests preserving various historical and cultural sites. Meanwhile, a Yangtze River deep-water channel is under construction to enable Nanjing to handle the navigation of 50,000 [[Deadweight tonnage|DWT]] vessels from the East China Sea.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.moc.gov.cn/jiaotongyaowen/201607/t20160705_2056811.html |script-title=zh:十二点五米深水航道初通南京 长江出海口至南京全程畅行五万吨级船舶 |language=zh-hans |date=July 5, 2016 |publisher=[[Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202014036/http://www.moc.gov.cn/jiaotongyaowen/201607/t20160705_2056811.html |archive-date=February 2, 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>{{Clear}}

=== Soil ===
{{Unreferencedsect|date=October 2024}}
There are mainly two types of soil in Nanjing: zonal soil and cultivated soil. The zonal soil is yellow-brown soil in the northern and central areas of Nanjing, and red soil in the southern part of the border with Anhui. The cultivated soil formed by human-made farming is mainly paddy soil, and there are some yellow Gang soil and vegetable garden soil. The distribution of soil presents a certain law with the undulation of topography and hydrological conditions, which can be divided into three categories: low mountain and hilly area, hilly area and plain area. According to the second national soil survey from 1980 to 1987, the soil in Nanjing is divided into 7 soil types, 13 subtypes, 30 soil genera and 66 soil species, with a total area of 416,300 hectares.

===Water===
[[File:Aerial panorama of Nanjing South and the Qinhuai River. December 2023.jpg|thumb|Aerial panorama of Fuzimiao and the Qinhuai River. December 2023.]]
Nanjing is located at the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The Yangtze River runs diagonally across the city from southwest to northeast. It is about 93 kilometers long and more than 300 kilometers away from the sea entrance. The Qinhuai River rushes from south to north, passes through the main urban area, and joins the Yangtze River. It is known as the mother river of Nanjing. Xuanwu Lake and Mochou Lake are like two pearls embedded in the main city. The water area of the city now accounts for about 11%. The river and lake water system mainly belongs to the Yangtze River system, and only the rivers that flow into Gaoyou Lake and Baoying Lake in the northern part of Liuhe District belong to the Huai River system. The Yangtze River system includes the Qinhuai River system in the south of the Yangtze River, the Chuhe River system in the north of the Yangtze River, the riverside system formed by small rivers that flow into the river on both sides of the river, the two lakes system composed of Shijiu Lake and Gucheng Lake, and the West Taihu Lake system in the east of Gaochun. The groundwater resources are abundant and the water quality is excellent, and the Pukou Pearl Spring is particularly famous. Jiangning Tangshan and Pukou Tangquan are hot spring areas with a long history.

===Yangtze River crossings===
{{main|Yangtze River bridges and tunnels}}
[[File:NJ 3rd Bridge-edit.jpg|thumb|Third Nanjing Yangtze Bridge]]
In the 1960s, the first [[Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge]] was completed, and served as the only bridge crossing over the Lower Yangtze in eastern China at that time. The bridge was a source of pride and an important symbol of modern China, having been built and designed by the Chinese themselves following failed surveys by other nations and the reliance on and then rejection of Soviet expertise. Begun in 1960 and opened to traffic in 1968, the bridge is a two-tiered road and rail design spanning {{cvt|4,600|m}} on the upper deck, with approximately {{cvt|1,580|m}} spanning the river itself.  Since then four more bridges and four tunnels have been built.  Going in the downstream direction, the Yangtze crossings in Nanjing are: [[Dashengguan Yangtze River Bridge|Dashengguan Bridge]], [[Third Nanjing Yangtze Bridge|Third Bridge]], Fifth Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, [[Nanjing Yangtze River Tunnel]] ({{lang|zh-Hans|南京长江隧道}}), [[Line 10, Nanjing Metro|Line 10 Metro Tunnel]], Nanjing Yangtze Tunnel ({{lang|zh-Hans|南京扬子江隧道}}), First Bridge, Yanziji Yangtze River Tunnel,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenanjinger.com/news/nanjing-news/2-metro-lines-new-yangtze-river-tunnel-open-on-same-day/|title=2 Metro Lines & New Yangtze River Tunnel Open on same Day!|date=December 29, 2022|website=The Nanjinger|access-date=January 3, 2023|archive-date=January 3, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230103031322/https://www.thenanjinger.com/news/nanjing-news/2-metro-lines-new-yangtze-river-tunnel-open-on-same-day/|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Second Nanjing Yangtze Bridge|Nanjing Baguazhou Yangtze River Bridge]] and [[Fourth Nanjing Yangtze Bridge|Nanjing Qixiashan Yangtze River Bridge]].

[[File:南京中国科举博物馆.jpg|thumb|[[Jiangnan Examination Hall]]]]
Being one of the four ancient capitals of China, Nanjing has always been a cultural center attracting intellectuals from all over the country. In the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song]] dynasties, Nanjing was a place where poets gathered and composed poems reminiscent of its luxurious past; during the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, the city was the official [[imperial examination]] center ([[Jiangnan Examination Hall]]) for the [[Jiangnan]] region, again acting as a hub where different thoughts and opinions converged and thrived.

Today, with a long cultural tradition and strong support from local educational institutions, Nanjing is commonly viewed as a "city of culture" and one of the more pleasant cities to live in China.

Nanjing is an important town of Chinese painting and calligraphy. In the Six Dynasties, there were painting and calligraphy masters such as Wang Xizhi, Wang Xianzhi, Zhang Sengyou, Lu Tanwei, and Gu Kaizhi. The earliest extant painting theory work "Paintings" has a profound impact on later generations. The Nantang Art Academy brought together outstanding calligraphy and painting masters at a time. Dongyuan and Juran pioneered the Southern School of Landscape and became a generation of masters. Xu Xi's flower and bird paintings, Zhou Wenju, and Gu Hongzhong's figure paintings continue to pass. "Han Xizai's Night Banquet" is a masterpiece of ancient Chinese meticulous brushwork. The system of Nantang Painting Academy was also inherited by later generations. The Painting Book of Ten Bamboo Studios in the Ming dynasty reproduced the paintings with the pinnacle of three-dimensional color printing techniques. The Painting Book of Mustard Seed Garden in the early Qing dynasty was regarded as a must-read for learning Chinese painting. The "Eight Masters of Nanjing" headed by Gong Xian were active in Nanjing in the early Qing dynasty and created the Jinling School of Painting. In the 1930s, celebrities in painting circles such as Lv Fengzi, Xu Beihong, Zhang Daqian, Yan Wenliang, Lu Sibai, Chen Zhifo, Gao Jianfu, Pan Yuliang, and Pang Xunqin gathered in Nanjing. Among them, Xu Beihong, Zhang Shuqi, and Liu Zigu were hailed as the "Three Masters of Jinling".
