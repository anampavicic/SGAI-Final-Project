'''Bhavnagar''' is a city and the headquarters of [[Bhavnagar district]] in the [[Indian state]] of [[Gujarat]]. It was founded in 1723 by Bhavsinhji Gohil. It was the capital of [[Bhavnagar State]], which was a [[princely state]] before it was merged into the [[Dominion of India|Indian Union]] in February 1948.

Bhavnagar is situated 190 kilometres away from the state capital [[Gandhinagar]] and to the west of the [[Gulf of Khambhat]]. It has always been an important city for trade with many large and small scale industries along with the world's largest [[ship breaking]] yard, [[Alang]] which is located 50 kilometres away. Bhavnagar is also famous for its version of the popular Gujarati snack '[[Ganthiya]]' and '[[Jalebi]]'.

==History==
[[File:CoA Bhaunagar 1893.jpeg|thumb|left|Coat of arms of the Indian native state of Bhaunagar]]
{{main|Bhavnagar State}}

[[File:Thakur of Bhavnagar in the 1870s.jpg|thumb|Thakur of Bhavnagar in the 1870s]]
The [[Gahlot|Gohil]] [[Rajputs|Rajput]] of the [[Suryavansha|Suryavanshi]] clan faced severe competition in [[Marwar]]. Around 1260 AD, they moved down to the Gujarat's coastal area and established three capitals: Sejakpur (now [[Ranpur, Gujarat|Ranpur]]), Umrala, and [[Sihor]].<ref name="Bhavnagar.com">{{cite web|title=History of Bhavnagar city|url=http://www.bhavnagar.com/history.asp|access-date=15 August 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817025546/http://bhavnagar.com/history.asp|archive-date=17 August 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Sejakpur was founded in 1194.

In 1722–1723, the forces led by Khanthaji Kadani and [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] [[Pilaji Gaekwad]] attempted to raid [[Sihor]] but were repelled by Maharajah Bhavsinhji Gohil. After the [[war]], Bhavsinhji realized the reason for repeated attacks was the location of Sihor. In 1723, he established a new capital near Vadva village, 20&nbsp;km away from Sihor, and named it Bhavnagar after himself. It was a carefully chosen and strategic location because of its potential for maritime trade. Naturally, Bhavnagar became the capital of Bhavnagar State. In 1807, Bhavnagar State became a [[British protectorate]].<ref name="Dosabhai">{{cite book|last=Dosábhai|first=Edalji
|title=A History of Gujarat from the Earliest Period to the Present Time|url=https://archive.org/details/ahistorygujartf00dosgoog|publisher=United Print and General Agency|year=1894| page=[https://archive.org/details/ahistorygujartf00dosgoog/page/n219 177]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/India_princes_A-J.html|title=Indian Princely States A-J|first=Ben|last=Cahoon|access-date=25 November 2016}}</ref>

The old town of Bhavnagar was a fortified town with gates leading to other important regional towns. It remained a major port for almost two centuries, trading commodities with Mozambique, [[Zanzibar]], [[Singapore]], and the [[Persian Gulf]].

Bhavsinhji ensured that Bhavnagar benefited from the revenue that was brought in from maritime trade, which was monopolized by [[Surat]] and [[Cambay State|Cambay]]. As the castle of Surat was under the control of the [[Siddi|Siddis]] of [[Janjira State|Janjira]], Bhavsinhji brokered an agreement with them, giving the Sidis 1.25% of the revenue by Bhavnagar port. Bhavsinhji entered into a similar agreement with the [[British Raj|British]] when they took over [[Surat]] in [[1856]]. Whilst Bhavsinhji was in power, Bhavnagar grew from a small chieftainship to a considerably important state. This was due to the addition of new territories as well as the income provided by maritime trade. Bhavsinhji's successors continued to encourage maritime trade through Bhavnagar port, recognizing its importance to the state. The territory was further expanded by Bhavsinhji's grandson, Vakhatsinhji Gohil, when he took possession of lands belonging to [[Koli people|Kolis]] and [[Kathi people|Kathis]], obtained [[Rajula]] from the Navab Saheb Ahmad Khan, and merged [[Ghogha]] Taluka into the state.

In 1793, Vakhatsinhji conquered the forts of Chital and Talaja, and later [[conquered]] [[Mahuva, Bhavnagar|Mahuva]], Kundla, Trapaj, Umrala and [[Botad]]. Bhavnagar remained the main port of the state, with Mahuva and Ghogha also becoming important ports. Because of the maritime trade, the state prospered compared to other states. During the late 19th century, the [[Bhavnagar State Railway]] was constructed. This made Bhavnagar the first state that was able to construct its railway system without any aid from the central government, which was mentioned in [[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]]. Mr. Peile, a political agent, described the state as follows: "With flourishing finances and much good work in progress. Of financial matters I need say little; you have no debts, and your treasury is full."<ref>{{cite book | title=Poverty and un-British rule in Inda | publisher=Low Price Publications | author=Naoroji, Dadabhai | year=1990 | pages=229}}</ref> Between 1870 and 1878, the state were put under joint administration, due to the fact that Prince [[Takhtsinhji]] was a minor. This period produced some notable reforms in the areas of administration, revenue collection, judiciary, [[Postal, telegraph and telephone service|the post and telegraph services]], and economic policy. The ports were also modernized. The two people who were responsible for those reforms were E. H. Percival of the [[Bombay Civil Service]] and [[Gaurishankar Udayshankar|Gaurishankar Udayshankar Oza]], Chief Minister of Bhavnagar State Bhavnagar Boroz.

In 1911, {{abbr|HH|Her Highness}} Maharani Nundkanvarba of Bhavnagar was awarded the [[Order of the Crown of India]], the highest Imperial award for women of the [[British Raj|British Empire]]. The former princely state of Bhavnagar was also known as Gohilwad, "Land of the Gohils" (the clan of the ruling family).

===Merger with the Indian Union in 1947===

Until the [[independence of India]] in 1947, Bhavnagar was an independent state ruled by the Rajput Gohil family. In 1947, the Deputy Prime Minister of the newly independent Indian Union [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]] undertook the ambitious and complex process of [[political integration of India|unifying]] 562 princely states with the Union of India. The last ruling Maharajah of Bhavnagar, [[Krishna Kumarsinhji Bhavsinhji|Krishnakumar Sinhji]] handed over the administration of his [[Bombay State]] to the people's representative in 1948.

Maharaja Krishna Kumarsinhji was one of the first to merge his kingdom to the Union of India.<ref>{{cite web | title=District Bhavnagar, Government of Gujarat | website=History of Bhavnagar | date=20 August 2018 | url=https://bhavnagar.nic.in/history/#:~:text=As%20per%20the%20Hindu%20calendar,of%20Shree%20Sardar%20Vallabhbhai%20Patel | access-date=24 March 2024}}</ref>

The erstwhile royal family of Bhavnagar continues to lead an active role in the public eye as well as in business (hotels, real estate, agriculture, and ship-breaking) and is held in high regard by the population both in the city as well as areas that comprised the former princely state of Bhavnagar.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/Bhavnagar-kings-sacrifice-to-feature-in-school-textbook/articleshow/10585349.cms|title=Bhavnagar king's sacrifice to feature in school textbook – Times of India|website=[[The Times of India]]|date=2 November 2011 |access-date=25 November 2016}}</ref>

==Geography and climate==

===Topography===
Bhavnagar is a coastal city on the eastern coast of Saurashtra, also known as [[Kathiawar]], located at {{coord|21.77|N|72.15|E|}}.<ref name="fallingrain">{{cite web
|publisher=Falling Rain Genomics, Inc.|title=Bhavnagar, India Page|url=https://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/09/Bhavnagar.html|access-date=15 August 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071001131726/http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/9/Bhavnagar.html| archive-date= 1 October 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> It has an average elevation of 24&nbsp;metres (78&nbsp;ft). It occupies an area of 53.3&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (20.6 sq mi) and 5th most populated city of Gujarat. The general slope dips towards the northeast at the apex of [[Gulf of Khambhat]]. A small non-perennial river named Kansara Nala passes through the outer area of the city.

===Climate===
Like most of Gujarat, Bhavnagar has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system|Köppen]]: ''BSh''), with hot, dry summers from March to mid-June, the wet monsoon season from mid-June to October, and mild winters from November to February. There is essentially no rainfall outside the monsoon season, whilst during the monsoon the city receives around {{convert|655|mm|in|0|disp=or}} of rain on average, though variability is extreme as can be seen from annual totals as high as {{convert|1428.9|mm|in|2|disp=or}} in 1970 but as little as {{convert|157.2|mm|in|2|disp=or}} in 1974.<ref>Dewar, Robert E. and Wallis, James R; ‘Geographical patterning of interannual rainfall variability in the tropics and near tropics: An L-moments approach’; in ''[[Journal of Climate]]'', 12; pp. 3457</ref> The semi-arid classification is due to the city's high [[evapotranspiration]]. The average temperature from November to February is around {{convert|23|C|1|disp=or}}, with low humidity.

==Geology==

The [[Saurashtra (region)|region of Saurashtra]] is a geologically active part of [[West India]], and falls in the [[Earthquake hazard zoning of India#Zone 3|seismic zone 3]] of the Zoning Map of the [[Bureau of Indian Standards]]. The region as a whole and the area around Bhavnagar, in particular, has been tectonically unstable.

Between 9 August 2000 and 15 December 2000, there was a series of earthquakes in east Saurashtra with [[epicenter]]s in Bhavnagar. 132 earthquakes between magnitude 0.5 to 3.8 were recorded. There were five earthquakes greater than magnitude 3, with a maximum magnitude of 3.8. These events were confined to an area which covered the southern part of Bhavnagar city and Tarsamiya village on the outskirts of the town. There was no loss of life recorded due to this earthquake.

According to historical records, an earthquake of magnitude 7 occurred near Bhavnagar in February 1705. [[Earthquake swarm]] activity also occurred in and around Paliyad (60&nbsp;km north of Bhavnagar) during July–August 1938 for about two months, with four earthquakes of magnitude greater than or equal to 5 and a maximum magnitude of 6.0.<ref name="ias.ac.in">{{cite web|title=Earthquake Sequence in and around Bhavnagar|url=http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/apr252004/1165.pdf|access-date=10 June 2008}}</ref>

==City planning and architecture==
[[File:Ghogha Circle.JPG|thumbnail|Ghogha Circle]]
Multiple town planning schemes were designed and implemented under the guidance of the progressive rulers of Bhavnagar. During the reign of Sir [[Takhtsinhji]], the British State Engineer Proctor Sims supervised the construction of Barton Library, Sir Takhtsinhji Hospital.<ref name=Bhavnagar.com/>[[File:Nilambagh Palace, Bhavnagar.jpg|thumb|upright|Nilambagh Palace, Bhavnagar]]
A few architectural examples include:
*Takhteshwar Temple (1893) is located on a hill, on a high plinth, offering a commanding view of Bhavnagar. The high shikhara rising above the pillared rectangular mandapa makes it an important landmark.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Indian government banned non-veg foods in the only city in the world |url=https://www.nayaindia.com/life-style/indian-government-banned-non-veg-foods-in-the-only-city-in-the-world-466349.html |publisher=Naya India |access-date=22 July 2024}}</ref>
* Gangajalia (1893) is a temple dedicated to Ganga-Devi, with a chhatri, pavilion, and bridge all of white marble. It is located in the middle of a former tank. It was designed by Sir John Griffith, principal of Sir J J School of Arts, [[Bombay]].
* [[Nilambag Palace]] (1894), now a heritage hotel, is set amidst a huge estate of {{convert|10|acre|ha}}. It was designed by a British architect, [[William Emerson (British architect)|William Emerson]] as a royal residence; he also designed the Sir Takhtsinhji Hospital and later Victoria Memorial in Calcutta.<ref>{{cite book |title=Gujarat–Daman–Diu: A Travel Guide|author=Philip Ward|publisher=Orient Blackswan|year= 1998|isbn=8125013830 |page=280 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P7EHTBl_pyQC&q=All+Saints+Cathedral,+Allahabad&pg=PA280 }}</ref> It combines elements of Indian architecture with a modern outlook.
* Barton Library (1895) is a two-storeyed building, appropriately designed for a road junction. It has two wings and a central tower, constructed in ashlar stone masonry, with [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] arch windows and a sloping roof with Mangalore tiles. It is one of the oldest libraries of Gujarat and also houses a museum.
* Town Hall (1932) was formerly a Darbar Hall, where the coronation of Sir Krishnakumarsinhji took place. It is an imposing structure in the colonial style, set in a well laid out garden.
*Modern & Contemporary Architectural services is provided by various leading Architectural firm like [[SAGA Architects|SAGA]] whose work is diverse yet of unified character, not only functional, aesthetic and techno-savvy.

Modern Bhavnagar comprises Takhteshvar Plots, Krishnanagar, Sardarnagar and surrounding area. During 1935–1937, Krishnanagar area was planned and developed by late Shri Virendrabhai C. Mehta, the official town planner for the State of Bhavnagar. In 1961, he extended his Krishnanagar plan towards Sardarnagar. In 1975, he created a master plan for Bhavnagar.

A salient feature of town planning is to have gardens at the junction of roads. Gardens are located at Ghogha Circle, Mahila College Circle, Rupani Circle, Meghani Circle, Shivaji Circle, Sardarnagar Circle, Jewels Circle and Crescent Circle.

The city of Bhavnagar was one of the earliest towns to have underground drainage in Gujarat,<ref name="GujaratGazetteers">{{cite book|title=Gujarat State Gazetteers, 1969|publisher=Directorate of Govt. Print., Stationery and Publications, Gujarat State| page=538}}</ref> and was among the first cities in Gujarat to have a water filtration plant.

==Ports==
Bhavnagar port had trade links with Southeast Asia, Africa, Arabia and ports of Red Sea since the early 18th century. The old port [[Bhavnagar Harbar]] was built by the state of Bhavnagar, and hosted a light beacon since 1860. [[iarchive:far-eastern-review-1938.7/mode/2up|Bhavnagar port]] was later modernized in 1930 under the supervision of J. Johnston, then port officer of Bhavnagar state. Wharfs, warehouses, and railway transportation were added. A new port, {{convert|8|km}} south of the old port, was built and made operational in the 1950s due to heavy silting at the location of the old port. This port also had a lighthouse, which was damaged in the [[2001 Gujarat earthquake|2001 earthquake]].<ref name="dgllnoida.gov.in">{{cite web|title=Bhavnagar Old Port Lighthouse |url=http://dgllnoida.gov.in/history/bhavnagar.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070814173359/http://dgllnoida.gov.in/history/bhavnagar.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 August 2007 |access-date=10 June 2008 }}
