The region forms part of the Northern Tourism Circuit in Tanzania. It is home to the [[Kilimanjaro National Park]] (which contains [[Mount Kilimanjaro]]), the [[Mkomazi National Park]], the [[Pare Mountains]], [[Lake Jipe]], and [[Lake Chala]]. The region is bordered to the north and east by [[Kenya]], to the south by the [[Tanga Region]], to the southwest by the [[Manyara Region]], and to the west by the [[Arusha Region]].

==Etymology==
In the early 19th century, the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] already referred to the mountain as "''Kilima Ndsharo''" (or "Dscharo"), "The Country of Dschagga," near the coast. In 1848 and 1849, [[Johannes Rebmann|Rebmann]] said the mountain  Swahili names mean "Great Mountain" and "the Mountain of the Caravans" in reference to the mountain that could be seen for a long distance and served as a guide for travelers. He and [[Johann Ludwig Krapf|Krapf]] found that the term was referred to differently by several nearby populations: the [[Taita people|Taita]] just shortened the coastal Swahili word to "''Ndscharo''." It was known as "''Kima ja Jeu''," which is [[Kamba people|Kamba]] for "Mountain of Whiteness." It was known as "''Ol Donyo Eibor''," which is [[Maasai people|Maasai]] for "White Mountain."  The [[Chaga people|Chagga]] themselves, especially the Kilema and [[Machame]], simply called it "''Kibo''". ''Kilimandscharo'', which Rebmann spelled in German between 1848 and 1849, was changed to "Kilimanjaro" by 1860.<ref>{{cite book |last= Stahl |first= Kathleen|date= 1964 |title=History of the Chagga people of Kilimanjaro|url=|location= London |publisher= Mouton and Co.|page= 38|isbn=0-520-06698-7}}</ref>

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}

Kilimanjaro Region was officially established in 1963 with two districts: Kilimanjaro and Pare.<ref>{{Citation |title=Myosorex zinki Kilimanjaro Mouse Shrew : Fr. Musaraigne des bois du Kilimanjaro; Ger. Kilimanjaro-Waldspitzmaus |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5040/9781472926944.0134 |work=Mammals of Africa : Hedgehogs, Shrews and Bats |access-date=2023-11-18 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing}}</ref> The region was part of the Northern Province in the pre-independence [[Tanganyika (territory)|Tanganyika]]. Northern Province's districts included Arusha and Mbulu, while Pare District was a part of Tanga Province.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kilimanjaro.go.tz/region-history|title=Historia ya Mkoa {{!}} Kilimanjaro Region|website=www.kilimanjaro.go.tz|access-date=2019-03-23|archive-date=2021-04-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210416131151/http://www.kilimanjaro.go.tz/region-history|url-status=live}}</ref>

Of the region's six districts, four traditionally had [[Chagga]] settlements, which are Hai District, Moshi District, Rombo District, and Siha District. The other two, Mwanga District and Same District, have historically included [[Pare people|Pare]] settlements. However, during colonial rule in the late 19th century to the middle of the 20th century, the region was divided into two main districts: Moshi district, which was composed of all the areas settled by the Chagga people on the slopes of the mountain, and Pare district, which was a Pare tribe settlement.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Murtazina |first=Farida Gafiullovna |date=2023-07-05 |title=Book review: Mironova Ye.V. Laishevsky district in the middle of the 19th – early 20th century: monograph (Kazan, 2022) |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.22378/2410-0765.2023-13-2.117-122 |journal=From History and Culture of Peoples of the Middle Volga Region |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=117–122 |doi=10.22378/2410-0765.2023-13-2.117-122 |issn=2410-0765|doi-access=free }}</ref> The region, from earlier times, had been settled by the people collectively called the Chagga, the [[Maasai people|Maasai]], [[Kwavi people|Wakwavi]], and [[Arusha people|Waarusha]] (in the lower parts of Mount Kilimanjaro), and the Pare on the Pare mountains. These have been intermingling, trading, and even fighting from time to time for various socio-political reasons. Later, other tribes also migrated to the area.

==Geology==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}

{{Main|Mount Kilimanjaro}}

[[File: Mountain at the border of Kenya and Tanzania- Mount Kilimanjaro 09.jpg|thumb|Mount Kilimanjaro]]

Mount Kilimanjaro lies on a tectonic plate line intersection {{convert|80|km|mi}} east of the tectonically active Rift Valley.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=2009-04-03 |title=Tectonic Geomorphology of a Plate Boundary |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9781444312003.ch8 |journal=Tectonically Active Landscapes |pages=213–270 |doi=10.1002/9781444312003.ch8}}</ref> The activity that created this stratovolcano dates back less than a million years. Steam and sulphur fumaroles here are indicative of residual activity.

At one stage, most of the summit of Kilimanjaro was covered by an ice cap, probably more than {{convert|100|m|ft|}} deep. Glaciers extended well down the mountain forming moraine ridges, clearly visible now on the southern flanks down to about {{convert|4000|m}}. At present only a small fraction of the glacial cover remains.
