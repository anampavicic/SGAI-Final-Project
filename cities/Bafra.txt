==History==

[[File:Bafracesme.JPG|thumbnail|Alibey Fountain]]

The name of the municipality is thought to have come from the [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] name "bafira" or "bavra".<ref>[http://docs.neu.edu.tr/library/6292179770.pdf Zengin, H. 2001.

Historical records of human settlement in Bafra and the [[Kızılırmak Delta|Kizilirmak delta]] date to as early as 5000 BC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bafder.org/baframiz-hakkinda |title=Baframız Hakkında |trans-title=About our Bafra |website=Bafralılar Kültür ve Yardımlaşma Derneği [Bafra People's Culture and Solidarity Association] |language=tr |accessdate=2022-05-09 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20220509165226/http://www.bafder.org/baframiz-hakkinda?msclkid=584c1560cfb711ecbcc8fdbc0c21d2aa |archivedate=2022-05-09}}</ref> Researchers working at the nearby İkiztepe ruins have found traces of human settlement belonging to the [[Chalcolithic]] period (5000-4000 BC). It has been determined that a continuous human settlement existed in the İkiztepe ruins between 4000 BC and 1700 BC. Additional evidence of settlement is found to have existed during the [[Bronze Age]] (3000-2000 BC) and Early Hittite (1900-1800 BC) period. Researchers found that an early capital existed in [[Hattusa]], [[Anatolia]] and later moved to the [[Kizilirmak]] Valley. The region was known as [[Paphlagonia]] as of 670 BC. [[6th century BC]], [[Persians]] invaded the region in [[546 BC]] and captured it from the [[Lydians]]. Graves from the [[Hellenistic]] period (330-30 BC) exist at İkiztepe.{{Cn|date=March 2024}}

The region came under the rule of the [[Roman Empire|Rome]] who renamed the area [[Gadilon]] and later Helega. After the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]], the area became part of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The region was a part of the [[Byzantine Empire]] until the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071. After that battle, Bafra was captured by the Anatolian [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum|Seljuk]] Ruler [[Kaykaus I]]. After being conquered by the [[Seljuk Empire]] the region was repopulated by members of various Turkmen tribes. The invasion of the [[Mongol Empire]] began in 1243 and led to the collapse of [[Seljuk Empire]] and the establishment of scattered Turkish principalities. During this period, the Bafra Principality was briefly established. This political arrangement continued until 1460, when Bafra was again conquered and made part of the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>Hilal Inalcik, The Ottoman Empire: The Classical Age 1300-1600</ref>{{Request quote|date=March 2024}}

Under the [[Ottoman Empire]], the town of Bafra was incorporated into [[Trabzon Province]] under the leadership of Canik Sanjak. The region flourished as an agricultural, fishing and shipping center under the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The exact date of the establishment of the modern town is not known, though according to historical census records it appears in 1854.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bafratarim.gov.tr/Bafra.asp |title=Bafra date information |url-status=dead |archivedate=2014-12-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231144504/http://www.bafratarim.gov.tr/Bafra.asp}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.recepsen.com/bafratarih.html |title=Bafra date |archivedate=2014-09-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915003428/http://www.recepsen.com/bafratarih.html |url-status=dead}}</ref> Many Turks came to Bafra from the [[Crimean Khanate]] after the loss of [[Crimea]] to the [[Russian Empire]] in 1783. These refugees largely settled in Bafra due to its location on the [[Black Sea]]. According to the Ottoman census of 1893, the population of Bafra was 62,782. The majority of those living in the region at the time of that census (62% (38,936 people)) were Sunni Muslim Turks. The Greek population of Bafra 22,834 (36%). As a result of the 1923 partition, the Greek population left the region entirely and was replaced by Greek Muslims most of whom came from [[Western Thrace]]. Fortunes for the [[Ottoman Empire]] declined further as a result of the Balkan and First World Wars during which the region became significantly impoverished. The decline in economic conditions lead to growing tensions between the largely impoverish ethnic Turkish Sunni Muslim population and the wealthier Greek and Armenian Christian populations. In the events preceding the [[Turkish War of Independence]], the Greek population of the region founded the Mavri Mira Society and considered the establishment of a [[Pontic Greeks|Pontic]] governate to fortify their interests. However, with the start of the [[Turkish War of Independence|National Struggle]] in 1919, these aims could not be realized and armed conflicted ensued. The Pontic Greek population left the region after the partition of 1923 which caused widespread economic devastation.<ref>Ataturk, Andrew Mango.{{full citation needed|date=May 2022}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2024}}

Refugees from the former [[Ottoman Empire]] were settled in Bafra and in villages along the Kızılırmak river in an attempt to repopulate the region and revive its agricultural economy. With the repopulation of the region, Bafra entered into a period of extensive agricultural, cultural and economic development. Between 1950 and 1951, a small number of Turks from the Deliorman region of Bulgaria resettled in Bafra. in the years 1950-1951. Due to Bafra's appealing growing climate and tobacco industry, many people from the Eastern Black Sea, [[Tokat]], [[Sivas]] and various provinces of Anatolia settled in the district. Bafra has a small population of [[Pomak]] people. Some of [[Pomak]] people continue to live in a traditional manner in the rural portions of Bafta. After the [[First Balkan War]], a large population of [[Albanians|Albanian]] immigrants from [[Kosovo]] settled around Bafra. Albanian has been forgotten by most Albanians, it is spoken only in villages among the elderly. In recent decades Bafra became a region defined by out-migration of the local population, political dysfunction and a decades long economic malaise caused by the decline of the tobacco industry and deindustrialization.{{Cn|date=March 2024}}

==Geography==

==Politics==
The mayor of Bafra is Hamit Kiliç from the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP). Bafra is considered a stronghold of the party and consistently supports the candidacy of [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] for Prime Minister and President. In 2018, 51.8% of voters in Bafra cast ballots for the AKP.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.yenisafak.com/en/secim-2018/samsun-bafra-secim-sonuclari | title=Samsun Bafra Election Results 2018 - Yeni Şafak Elections | date=5 September 2022 }}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2024}} This figure declined however from a peak performance in 2015 when 61.9% of residents voted for the AKP.

==Economy==
{{Update section|date=April 2024|reason=economy now?}}
Bafra's economy has historically been driven by the growth and export of [[tobacco]]. The region's tobacco is known to be very low [[nicotine]], small, red, light red colored, fine-grained, fine-grained, elastic, high-smoked, sweet, and aromatic. Foreign [[cigarette]] manufacturers were said to desire the tobacco grown on the Bafra Plain in order to improve the quality of their products. Bafra tobacco was long sought as the highest quality of natural tobacco in the world.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://blog.milliyet.com.tr/Blog.aspx?BlogNo=192580 | title = Bafra and World Use of Turkish Tobacco | accessdate = | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150603170512/http://blog.milliyet.com.tr/Blog.aspx?BlogNo=192580 | archivedate = June 3, 2015 | url-status = dead}}</ref> Due to a variety of factors including agricultural mismanagement, reduced demand, logistical challenges and innovation in tobacco growth elsewhere in the world has led to a decline in tobacco exports from Bafra. This has had a significant adverse effect on the local population and contributed to persistently high unemployment and out-migration among working age people in the region. This crisis was further exacerbated by the Turkish government's shutdown of [[TEKEL]]. Today tobacco production in the region is negligible with most former farms now growing other products.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tarimsalhaber.com/bafrada-tutun-ekimi-h101.html | title = Decreased Production AA News | accessdate = | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130605001654/http://www.tarimsalhaber.com/bafrada-tutun-ekimi-h101.html | archivedate = June 5, 2013 | url-status = dead}}</ref>

*[[Nokul]]: is a type of [[puff pastry]]. Nokul is a type of pastry eaten in [[Turkey]] and [[Bulgaria]] with variations. Nokul is sometimes served hot as an appetizer instead of bread. It consists of a rolled sheet of yeast dough onto which [[feta]]-style white cheese, walnut or poppy seed is sprinkled over a thin coat of butter. The dough is then rolled, cut into individual portions, and baked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.milliyet.com.tr/Blog.aspx?BlogNo=73839|title=Cevizli lokum Bursa'nın|work=blog.milliyet.com.tr}}</ref>
