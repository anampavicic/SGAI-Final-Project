'''Zabrze''' ({{IPA|pl|ˈzabʐɛ|-|Pl-Zabrze.ogg}}; German: 1915–1945: ''Hindenburg O.S.'', full form: ''Hindenburg in Oberschlesien'', [[Silesian language|Silesian]]: ''Zŏbrze'', {{langx|yi|זאַבזשע|Zabzhe}}) is an industrial city in [[Silesia]] in southern [[Poland]], near [[Katowice]]. It lies in the western part of the [[Metropolis GZM]], a metropolis with a population of around 2 million. It is in the [[Silesian Highlands]], on the Bytomka River, a tributary of the [[Oder River|Oder]].

Zabrze is located in the [[Silesian Voivodeship]], which was reformulated in 1999. Before 1999 it was in [[Katowice Voivodeship]]. It is one of the cities composing the 2.7&nbsp;million inhabitant conurbation referred to as the [[Katowice urban area]], itself a major centre in the greater [[Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area]] which is populated by just over five million people.<ref>[[European Spatial Planning Observation Network]] (ESPON) [http://www.espon.eu/mmp/online/website/content/projects/261/420/index_EN.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728052348/http://www.espon.eu/mmp/online/website/content/projects/261/420/index_EN.html|date=28 July 2009}}</ref> The population of Zabrze as of December 2021 was 168,946, down from June 2009 when the population was 188,122.<ref name="population" /> Zabrze is bordered by three other cities of the metropolitan area: [[Gliwice]], [[Bytom]] and [[Ruda Śląska]].

Biskupice, which is now a subdivision of Zabrze, was first mentioned in 1243 as ''Biscupici dicitur cirka [[Bytom|Bitom]]''{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}. Zabrze (or ''Old'' Zabrze) was mentioned in 1295–1305 as ''Sadbre sive Cunczindorf'' (German for '' [[Konrad (disambiguation)|Konrad]]/Kunze's village''; ''sive'' = "or"). According to historical sources, mining in Zabrze dates back to the 13th century.<ref name=am>{{cite web|url=https://zabytek.pl/pl/obiekty/zabrze-zespol-zabudowy-dawnej-kopalni-krolowa-luiza|title=Zespół zabudowy dawnej Kopalni "Królowa Luiza"|website=Zabytek.pl|author=Agata Mucha|accessdate=25 July 2021|language=pl}}</ref> The present-day districts of Mikulczyce and Rokitnica were locations of [[motte-and-bailey castle]]s from the 13th-15th century, which are now archaeological sites.<ref name=mb>{{cite web|url=https://zabytek.pl/pl/obiekty/g-290033|title=Grodzisko stożkowate (Mikulczyce)|website=Zabytek.pl|author=Michał Bugaj|accessdate=25 July 2021|language=pl}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://zabytek.pl/pl/obiekty/g-290037|title=Grodzisko stożkowate (Rokitnica)|website=Zabytek.pl|author=Michał Bugaj|accessdate=25 July 2021|language=pl}}</ref> In the 1970s, archaeologists discovered an [[Epipalaeolithic]] flintwork and [[flint]] tools from the [[Mesolithic]] at the Mikulczyce archaeological site.<ref name=mb/> In the [[Late Middle Ages]], the local [[Silesia]]n [[Piast]] dukes invited German settlers into the territory, resulting in increasing [[Ostsiedlung|German settlement]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}. The settlement was part of the [[Silesia]]n duchies of fragmented Poland. Zabrze became part of the [[Habsburg monarchy]] in 1526. In 1645, along with the [[Duchy of Opole]], Zabrze returned to Polish rule under the [[House of Vasa]], in 1666 it fell back to the Habsburgs, and was later annexed by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] during the [[Silesian Wars]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}. In 1774, the [[Dorota (village)|Dorotheendorf settlement]] was founded. In 1791, a [[coking coal]] seam was discovered in Zabrze, and then its first coking coal mine was opened.<ref name=am/> In the 19th century, new coal mines, steelworks, factories and a power plant were created. A road connecting [[Gliwice]] and [[Chorzów]] and a railway connecting [[Opole]] and [[Świętochłowice]] were led through Zabrze.

===Early 20th century===
In 1905, the Zabrze commune was formed by the former communes Alt-Zabrze, Klein-Zabrze and Dorotheendorf. The Zabrze commune was renamed ''Hindenburg'' in 1915 in honour of [[Generalfeldmarschall]] [[Paul von Hindenburg]]. The name change was approved by Emperor [[Wilhelm II]] on 21 February 1915.<ref name="UM">[http://www.um.zabrze.pl/mieszkancy/miasto/historia/hindenburg Historia – Hindenburg] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501095304/http://www.um.zabrze.pl/mieszkancy/miasto/historia/hindenburg |date=1 May 2019 }} at the official website of Zabrze</ref> Up until then, it was one of the few cities whose Polish name was retained during German rule.

In 1904 the [[Polish Sokół movement|"Sokół" Polish Gymnastic Society]] in Zabrze was established, which was also a Polish patriotic and pro-independence organization.<ref name=SOK>{{cite web |url=https://historia-zabrza.pl/polskie-towarzystwo-gimnastyczne-sokolw-zabrzu/|title=Polskie Towarzystwo Gimnastyczne "Sokół" w Zabrzu, Historia Zabrza|date=31 July 2016 |access-date=10 June 2019}}</ref> As a result of the Prussian harassment it was liquidated in 1911, but it was reactivated twice, in 1913 and 1918.<ref>''Encyklopedia powstań śląskich'', Instytut Śląski w Opolu, Opole, 1982, p. 637</ref><ref name=SOK/> Its members took an active part in the post-war plebiscite campaign and the [[Silesian uprisings]].<ref name=SOK/>

During the plebiscite held after [[World War I]], 21,333 inhabitants (59%) of the Hindenburg commune voted to remain in Germany, while 14,873 (41%) voted for incorporation to Poland, which just regained its independence.<ref name="UM"/> In May 1921 the Third [[Silesian Uprisings|Silesian Uprising]] broke out and Hindenburg was captured by Polish insurgents, who held it until the end of the uprising.<ref name="UM"/> When [[Upper Silesia]] was divided between Poland and Germany in 1921, the Hindenburg commune remained in Germany, while the present-day districts of Kończyce, [[Makoszowy]] and Pawłów were reintegrated with Poland.<ref name="UM"/> It received its [[city charter]] in 1922. Just five years after receiving city rights Hindenburg became the biggest city in German-ruled western Upper Silesia and the second biggest city in German-ruled Silesia after [[Wrocław]] (then ''Breslau''). Nevertheless, various Polish organizations still operated in the city in the [[interbellum]], including a local branch of the [[Union of Poles in Germany]],{{sfn|Cygański|1984|p=24}} Polish libraries, [[sports clubs]], [[credit union]]s, choirs, [[scout troop]]s and an amateur theater.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|Węcki|2010|p=74}} Polish newspaper ''Głos Ludu'' was published in the city.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|Węcki|2010|p=124}} In a secret ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' report from 1934, Zabrze was named one of the main centers of the Polish movement in western Upper Silesia.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|Węcki|2010|p=60}} In terms of religion, most of the city's population adhered to the [[Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Rosenbaum|Węcki|2010|p=35}}

In the 1920s, the [[Communist Party of Germany|communists]], [[Centre Party (Germany)|Christian democrats]] and [[German National People's Party|nationalists]] enjoyed the greatest support among the German population, while Poles supported Polish parties.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|Węcki|2010|p=53-54}} In 1924 the [[Communist Party of Germany]] won the local elections and proposed changing the name of the city to ''Leninburg''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Zalega |first=Dariusz |title=Chachary.

The anti-Polish organization [[Bund Deutscher Osten]] was very active in the city, it dealt with [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|propaganda]], indoctrination and espionage of the Polish community, as well as denouncing Poles to local authorities.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|Węcki|2010|p=50}} When, the Barbórka (traditional holiday of miners) church services were organized separately for Poles and Germans in 1936, the Polish service enjoyed a greater attendance,{{sfn|Rosenbaum|Węcki|2010|p=130}} however, due to Nazi oppression and propaganda, the attendance at Polish services in the 1930s gradually decreased, according to Bund Deutscher Osten.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|Węcki|2010|p=157}} Polish activists were increasingly persecuted since 1937.{{sfn|Cygański|1984|p=24}} People were urged to [[Germanisation|Germanise]] their names, Polish inscriptions were removed from tombstones.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|Węcki|2010|p=50}} Some Polish priests were expelled from the city, both before{{sfn|Cygański|1984|p=26}} and during [[World War II]].{{sfn|Rosenbaum|Węcki|2010|p=100}} As a result of German persecution the [[Jews|Jewish]] community dropped from 1,154 people in 1933 to 551 in 1939, and its remainder was deported to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] in 1942.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|Węcki|2010|p=35}} The town's synagogue, that had stood since 1872, was destroyed in the ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' pogroms of November 1938.<ref>[[Ghetto Fighters' House]] archives, Photo No. 55805: a memorial monument placed by the Zabrze municipality in 1998 to commemorate its Jewish community.</ref>

In January 1945, the Soviets captured the city and afterwards deported some inhabitants to the [[Soviet Union]], while other inhabitants were [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled]] west in accordance to the [[Potsdam Agreement]]. However, in stark contrast to the other cities in the so-called  [[Recovered territories]], three quarters of the mostly bilingual inhabitants were spared expulsion.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Fußballegende mit deutsch-polnischem Hintergrund|lang=de|journal=Kulturkorrespondenz östliches Europa|issue=1441|pages=30|author=Dawid Smolorz}}</ref>

Following [[World War II]], according to the [[Potsdam Agreement]] the city was handed over to Poland in 1945 and the town's name was changed to the historic ''Zabrze'' on 19 May 1945. The first post-war mayor of Zabrze was Paweł Dubiel, pre-war Polish activist and journalist in Upper Silesia, prisoner of the [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] and [[Mauthausen concentration camp|Mauthausen]] concentration camps during the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bs.sejm.gov.pl/F?func=find-b&request=000004103|title=Dubiel Paweł Mikołaj (1902–1980)|website=Biblioteka Sejmowa|access-date=25 March 2020|language=pl}}</ref> The pre-war Polish inhabitants of the region, who formed the majority of the city's population in 1948,<ref name=umz/> were joined by Poles expelled from [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union]].
