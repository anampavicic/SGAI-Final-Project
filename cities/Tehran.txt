Tehran was first chosen as the capital of Iran by [[Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar|Agha Mohammad Khan]] of the [[Qajar dynasty]] in 1786, because of its proximity to Iran's territories in the [[Caucasus]], then separated from Iran in the [[Russo-Persian Wars|Russo-Iranian Wars]], to avoid the vying factions of the previously ruling Iranian dynasties. The capital has been moved several times throughout history, however, and Tehran became the 32nd [[Capitals of Persia|capital of Persia]]. Large-scale construction works began in the 1920s, and Tehran became a destination for mass migrations from all over Iran since the 20th century.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/585619/Tehran |title=Tehran (Iran) : Introduction – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=2012-05-21 |date= |archive-date=2012-03-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330180118/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/585619/Tehran |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Various theories on the origin of the name Tehran have been put forward.

Iranian linguist [[Ahmad Kasravi]], in an article "Shemiran-Tehran", suggested that Tehran and Kehran mean "the warm place", and "Shemiran" means "the cool place". He listed cities with the same base and suffix and studied the components of the word in ancient [[Iranian languages]], and came to the conclusion that Tehran and Kehran meant the same thing in different Iranian language families, as the constant "t" and "k" are close to each other in such languages. He also provided evidence that cities named "Shemiran" were colder than those named "Tehran" or "Kehran". He considered other theories not considering the ancient history of Iranian languages such as "Tirgan" theory and "Tahran" theory [[folk etymology]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Yahya|first=Zoka|title=Karvand of Kasravi|publisher=Franklin|year=1978|location=Tehran|pages=273–283}}</ref>

Another theory is that "Tehran" derives from Tiran/Tirgan, "the abode of [[Tir (god)|Tir]]", the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] equivalent of [[Hermes]]). The ancient [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] town of Tiran had a neighbour, [[Mehran (district)|Mehran]] ("abode of Mehr/Mithra", the Zoroastrian sun/justice angel). Both of these were mere villages in the suburbs of the great city of Ray/Rhages. Mehran still exists as a residential district in Greater Tehran, as well as Ray, which forms the southern suburbs of Tehran. {{Citation needed|date=April 2024}}

The official City of Tehran website says that "Tehran" comes from the Persian words "Tah" meaning "end", or "bottom", and "Ran" meaning "[mountain] slope"—literally, the bottom of the mountain (ته کوه), referring to Tehran's position at the foot of the [[Alborz]] mountains.<ref>{{Cite web |author1=Behrooz, Samira |author2=Karampour, Katayoun |url=http://universityandheritage.net/SIFU/XII_Hanoi_2009/en/abstracts/html/14.html |title=A Research on Adaptation of Historic Urban Landscapes |date=November 15, 2008 |access-date=June 18, 2009 |archive-date=July 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724115732/http://universityandheritage.net/SIFU/XII_Hanoi_2009/en/abstracts/html/14.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== History ==
{{For timeline}}

Archaeological remains from the ancient city of Ray suggest that settlement in Tehran dates back over 6,000 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Tehran/History|title = Tehrān - History}}</ref>

=== Classical era ===
Tehran is in the historical [[Media (region)|Media]] region of ({{langx|peo|𐎶𐎠𐎭}} {{transliteration|peo|Māda}}) in northwestern Iran. By the time of the [[Medes|Median Empire]], part of present-day Tehran was a suburb of the prominent Median city of Rhages ({{langx|peo|𐎼𐎥𐎠}} {{transliteration|peo|Ragā}}). In the [[Avesta]]'s ''[[Vendidad|Videvdat]]'' (i, 15), Rhages is mentioned as the 12th sacred place created by [[Ahura Mazda|Ohrmazd]].<ref name="Minorsky">{{Cite encyclopedia |author1=Minorsky, Vladimir |author2=Bosworth, Clifford Edmund |title=Al-Rayy |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam: New Edition |volume=8 |pages=471–473}}</ref> In [[Achaemenid Empire|Old Persian]] inscriptions, Rhages appears as a province ([[Behistun Inscription|Bistun]] 2, 10–18). From Rhages, [[Darius I]] sent reinforcements to his father [[Hystaspes (father of Darius I)|Hystaspes]], who was putting down a rebellion in [[Parthia]] (Bistun 3, 1–10).<ref name="Minorsky" /> Some [[Middle Persian]] texts give Rhages as the birthplace of [[Zoroaster]],<ref>{{Citation |author1=Sarkhosh Curtis, Vesta |author2=Stewart, Sarah |title=Birth of the Persian Empire |publisher=I.B. Tauris |date=2005 |page=37}}</ref> although modern historians generally place the birth of Zoroaster in [[Khorasan Province]].

[[Mount Damavand]], the highest peak of Iran, which is located near Tehran, is an important location in [[Ferdowsi]]'s ''[[Shahnameh|Šāhnāme]]'',<ref name="Tafazolli">A. Tafazolli, "In Iranian Mythology" in Encyclopædia Iranica</ref> an Iranian [[epic poem]] based on the [[Persian mythology|ancient legends of Iran]]. It appears in the epics as the homeland of the [[Protoplast (religion)|protoplast]] [[Keyumars]], the birthplace of King [[Manuchehr]], the place where King [[Fereydun]] bound the dragon fiend [[Zahhak|Aždahāk]] (Bivarasp), and the place where [[Arash]] shot his arrow.<ref name="Tafazolli" />

=== Medieval period ===
In 641, during the reign of the [[Sasanian Empire]], [[Yazdegerd III|Yazdgerd III]] issued his last appeal to the nation from Rhages, before fleeing to Khorasan.<ref name="Minorsky" /> Rhages was dominated by the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] [[House of Mihran]], and [[Siyavakhsh]]—the son of [[Mihran Bahram-i Chubin|Mehran]], the son of [[Bahram Chobin]]—who resisted the seventh-century [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Muslim invasion of Iran]].<ref name="Minorsky" /> Because of this resistance, when the Arabs captured Rhages, they ordered the town destroyed and rebuilt anew by traitor aristocrat [[Farrukhzad]].<ref name="Minorsky" />

In the ninth century, Tehran was a well-known village, but less so than the city of Rhages, flourishing nearby. Rhages was described in detail by tenth-century Muslim geographers.<ref name="Minorsky" /> Despite the interest that Arabian [[Baghdad]] displayed in Rhages, the number of Arabs in the city remained insignificant and the population mainly consisted of Iranians of all classes.<ref name="Minorsky" /><ref>(Bulddan, Yackubl, 276)</ref>

The [[Oghuz Turks]] invaded Rhages in 1035, and again in 1042, but the city was recovered under the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuks]] and the [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarezmians]].<ref name="Minorsky" /> Medieval writer [[Najm al-Din Razi|Najm od Din Razi]] declared the population of Rhages about 500,000 before the [[Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia|Mongol invasion]]. In the 13th century, the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] invaded Rhages, laid the city to ruins, and massacred many of its inhabitants.<ref name="Minorsky" /> Others escaped to Tehran.

In July 1404, [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] ambassador [[Ruy González de Clavijo]] visited Tehran on a journey to [[Samarkand]], the capital of Turco-Mongol conqueror [[Timur]], the ruler of Iran at the time. He described it in his diary as an unwalled region.

=== Early modern era ===
Italian traveler [[Pietro della Valle]] passed through Tehran overnight in 1618, and in his memoirs called the city ''Taheran''. English traveler [[Sir Thomas Herbert, 1st Baronet|Thomas Herbert]] entered Tehran in 1627, and mentioned it as ''Tyroan''. Herbert stated that the city had about 3,000 houses.<ref name="britannica1911">{{cite EB1911|wstitle= Teheran (city) |volume= 26 | pages = 506&ndash;507: final para |last1= Houtum-Schindler |first1= Albert |author-link= Albert Houtum-Schindler }}</ref>

In the early 18th century, [[Karim Khan Zand|Karim Khan]] of the [[Zand dynasty]] ordered a palace and a government office built in Tehran, possibly to declare the city his capital; but he later moved his government to [[Shiraz]]. Eventually, Qajar king [[Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar|Agha Mohammad Khan]] chose Tehran as the capital of Iran in 1786.<ref name="books.google.nl">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdFu7X2UtpAC&pg=PA12 |title=Pivot of the Universe: Nasir Al-Din Shah Qajar and the Iranian Monarchy, 1831–1896 |access-date=December 26, 2014 |first=Abbas |last=Amanat |date=1997 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |isbn=9780520083219 |archive-date=January 1, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101191554/https://books.google.com/books?id=xdFu7X2UtpAC&pg=PA12 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Agha Mohammad Khan's choice of his capital was based on a similar concern for the control of both northern and southern Iran.<ref name="books.google.nl" /> He was aware of the loyalties of the inhabitants of former capitals [[Isfahan]] and Shiraz to the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] and Zand dynasties respectively, and was wary of the power of the local notables in these cities.<ref name="books.google.nl" /> Thus, he probably viewed Tehran's lack of a substantial urban structure as a blessing, because it minimized the chances of resistance to his rule by the notables and by the general public.<ref name="books.google.nl" /> Moreover, he had to remain within close reach of [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]] and Iran's integral [[North Caucasus|northern]] and [[South Caucasus|southern]] [[Caucasus|Caucasian territories]]<ref name="books.google.nl" />—at that time not yet irrevocably lost per the treaties of [[Treaty of Gulistan|Golestan]] and [[Treaty of Turkmenchay|Turkmenchay]] to the neighboring [[Russian Empire]]—which would follow in the course of the 19th century.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Dowling, Timothy C. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KTq2BQAAQBAJ |title=Russia at War: From the Mongol Conquest to Afghanistan, Chechnya, and Beyond |pages=728–730 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |date=December 2, 2014 |isbn=978-1-59884-948-6 |access-date=March 18, 2016 |archive-date=October 12, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012040129/https://books.google.com/books?id=KTq2BQAAQBAJ |url-status=live }}</ref>

After 50 years of Qajar rule, the city still barely had more than 80,000 inhabitants.<ref name="books.google.nl" /> Up until the 1870s, Tehran consisted of a walled citadel, a roofed [[bazaar]], and the three main neighborhoods of [[Oudlajan|Udlajan]], Chale-Meydan, and Sangelaj, where the majority resided.

During the long reign of [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar|Naser al-Din Shah]] (1848-1896), Tehran witnessed Iran's first [[Dar ul-Funun (Persia)|institute of higher learning]], [[Imperial Bank of Persia|bank]], [[Tehran–Rey Railway|railway line]] and museum. <ref>{{Citation |title=Chisholm, Hugh, (22 Feb. 1866–29 Sept. 1924), Editor of the Encyclopædia Britannica (10th, 11th and 12th editions) |date=2007-12-01 |work=Who Was Who |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u194658 |access-date=2024-09-26 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/9780230270510 |title=The Statesman's Year-Book |date=1922-08-25 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-0-230-27051-0 |editor-last=Scott-Keltie |editor-first=John |location=Basingstoke |editor-last2=Epstein |editor-first2=Mortimer}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |title=IV.

=== Late modern era ===
[[File:Poster of Conquest of Tehran in July 1909 by Bakhtiaris.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Triumph of Tehran]]: [[Ali-Qoli Khan Bakhtiari|Sardar Asad II]] and [[Mohammad Vali Khan Tonekaboni|Sepahsalar e Tonekaboni]] conquering Tehran in July 1909]]
Growing awareness of civil rights resulted in the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution|Constitutional Revolution]] and the [[Persian Constitution of 1906|first constitution of Iran]] in 1906. On June 2, 1907, the parliament passed a law on local governance known as the ''Baladie'' ([[municipal law]]), providing a detailed outline of issues such as the role of councils within the city, the members' qualifications, the election process, and the requirements to be entitled to vote. The then-Qajar monarch [[Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar|Mohammad Ali Shah]] abolished the constitution and [[1908 bombardment of the Majlis|bombarded]] the parliament with the help of the Russian-controlled [[Persian Cossack Brigade|Cossack Brigade]] on June 23, 1908. That was followed by the capture of the city by the revolutionary forces of [[Ali-Qoli Khan Bakhtiari|Ali-Qoli Khan]] (Sardar Asad II) and [[Mohammad Vali Khan Tonekaboni|Mohammad Vali Khan]] (Sepahsalar e Tonekaboni) on July 13, 1909. As a result, the monarch was exiled and replaced by his son [[Ahmad Shah Qajar|Ahmad]], and the parliament was re-established.

==== World War I ====
During the [[Persian campaign (World War I)|Persian campaign]], Russian forces that were occupying the northwest of Iran marched around [[Qazvin]] and approached Tehran, caused a crisis and the dissolution of [[National Consultative Assembly|parliament]]. [[Ahmad Shah Qajar]] and his entourage decided to leave Tehran and move the capital to another place, sparking fears of rebellion in other cities.<ref name="Bahar-1992">[[Mohammad-Taqi Bahar|Bahar, Mohammad Taghi]] (1992). A brief history of political parties in Iran: the extinction of the Qajar dynasty. J. First. Amir Kabir Publications. {{ISBN|9789640005965}}</ref>

During the [[Battle of Robat Karim]], Iranian forces led by Heydar Latifiyan prevented the Russians from taking Tehran, despite the latter winning the battle.<ref>{{Cite web |title=جنگ‌های جهانی |url=https://movarekhpod.com/world-wars/ |access-date=2024-05-05 |website=مورخ |language=fa-IR}}</ref> This also allowed government functions to be moved to Qom and then to Isfahan, while the monarchy remained in Tehran.<ref name="Bahar-1992" />

==== Pahlavi rule ====
[[File:ETH-BIB-Teheran aus 400 m Höhe-Persienflug 1924-1925-LBS MH02-02-0085-AL-FL.tif|250px|thumb|Aerial view of Tehran in 1925]]
After [[World War I]], the [[constituent assembly]] elected [[Reza Shah]] of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] as the new monarch, who immediately suspended the Baladie law of 1907, replacing the decentralized and autonomous city councils with centralist approaches to [[governance]] and planning.<ref name="Vahdat Za-2011" />

From the 1920s to the 1930s, under the rule of Reza Shah, the city was essentially rebuilt from scratch. Several old buildings, including parts of the [[Golestan Palace]], [[Tekyeh Dowlat|Tekye Dowlat]], and [[Toopkhaneh|Tupkhane Square]], were replaced with modern buildings influenced by classical Iranian architecture, particularly the buildings of the [[Bank Melli Iran|National Bank]], the police headquarters, the telegraph office, and the military academy.

Changes to the urban fabric began with the street-widening act of 1933, which served as a framework for changes in all other cities. The [[Grand Bazaar, Tehran|Grand Bazaar]] was divided in half and many historic buildings were demolished and replaced by wide straight avenues,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chaichian |first1=Mohammad |url=https://archive.org/details/towncountryinmid0000chai/page/95/mode/2up |title=Town and Country in the Middle East: Iran and Egypt in the Transition to Globalization |date=2009 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=978-0-7391-2677-6 |location=New York |pages=95–116 |url-access=registration}}</ref> and the traditional texture of the city was replaced with intersecting cruciform streets that created large roundabouts in major public spaces such as the bazaar.

As an attempt to create a network for easy transportation within the city, the old citadel and city walls were demolished in 1937, replaced by wide streets cutting through the urban fabric. The new city map of Tehran in 1937 was heavily influenced by modernist planning patterns of zoning and gridiron networks.<ref name="Vahdat Za-2011" />

During [[World War II]], Soviet and British troops entered the city. In 1943, Tehran was the site of the [[Tehran Conference]], attended by U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], Soviet Premier [[Joseph Stalin]], and British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].

The establishment of the planning organization of Iran in 1948 resulted in the first socioeconomic development plan to cover from 1949 to 1955. These plans not only failed to slow the unbalanced growth of Tehran but with the 1962 land reforms that Reza Shah's son and successor [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Mohammad Reza Shah]] named the ''[[White Revolution]]'', Tehran's chaotic growth was further accentuated.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Tehran developed rapidly under Mohammad Reza Shah. Modern buildings altered the face of Tehran and ambitious projects were planned for the following decades. To resolve the problem of [[social exclusion]], the first comprehensive plan was approved in 1968. The consortium of Iranian architect [[Abdol-Aziz Mirza Farmanfarmaian|Abd-ol-Aziz Farmanfarmaian]] and the American firm of [[Victor Gruen|Victor Gruen Associates]] identified the main problems blighting the city as high-density suburbs, air and water pollution, inefficient infrastructure, unemployment, and rural-urban migration. Eventually, the whole plan was marginalized by the [[1979 Revolution]] and the subsequent [[Iran–Iraq War]].<ref name="Vahdat Za-2011" />

[[File:Tehran_IMG_20191219_122637099_(49550671088).jpg|thumb|The [[Azadi Tower]] was built in 1971.]]
Tehran's most famous landmark, the Azadi Tower, was built by the order of the Shah in 1971. It was designed by [[Hossein Amanat]], an architect whose design won a competition, combining elements of classical [[Sasanian architecture|Sassanian architecture]] with post-classical Iranian architecture. Formerly known as the ''Shahyad Tower'', it was built to commemorate the [[2,500-year celebration of the Persian Empire|2,500th anniversary of the Imperial State of Iran]].

===Islamic Republic===
During the [[Iran–Iraq War]] in 1980 to 1988, Tehran was repeatedly targeted by airstrikes and [[Scud]] missile attacks.

Tabiat Bridge, a 270-meter [[footbridge|pedestrian overpass]]<ref name="archdaily" /> that was designed by award-winning architect [[Leila Araghian]], was completed in 2014.

===Language and ethnicity===

Tehran saw a drastic change in its ethnic-social composition in the early 1980s. After the political, social, and economic consequences of the [[1979 Revolution]] and the years that followed, a number of Iranian citizens, mostly Tehranis, left Iran. The majority of [[Iranian diaspora|Iranian emigrations]] have left for the [[Iranian Americans|United States]], [[Iranians in Germany|Germany]], [[Swedish Iranians|Sweden]], and [[Iranian Canadians|Canada]].

With the start of the [[Iran–Iraq War]] (1980–1988), the second wave of inhabitants fled the city, especially during the Iraqi air offensives on the capital. With most major powers backing Iraq at the time, economic isolation gave yet more reason for many inhabitants to leave the city (and the country). Having left all they had and having struggled to adapt to a new country and build a life, most of them never came back when the war was over. During the war, Tehran also received a great number of migrants from the west and the southwest of the country bordering [[Iraq]].

The unstable situation and the war in neighbouring [[Afghanistan]] and Iraq prompted a rush of refugees into the country who arrived in millions, with Tehran being a magnet for many seeking work, who subsequently helped the city to recover from war wounds, working for a far lower pay than local construction workers. Many of these refugees are being repatriated with the assistance of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]], but there are still sizable groups of Afghan and Iraqi refugees in Tehran who are reluctant to leave, being pessimistic about the situation in their own countries. Afghan refugees are mostly [[Dari language|Dari]]-speaking [[Tajiks|Tajik]] and [[Hazara people|Hazara]], speaking a variety of Persian, and Iraqi refugees are mainly [[Mesopotamian Arabic]]-speakers who are often of Iranian and Persian ethnic heritage.

=== Religion ===
{{See also|Religion in Iran|List of religious centers in Tehran}}
The majority of Tehranis are officially [[Twelver Shia]] [[Islam|Muslims]], which has also been the state religion since the 16th-century [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|Safavid conversion]]. Other religious communities in the city include followers of the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Sufism|Mystic]] branches of Islam, various [[Christianity|Christian]] denominations, [[Judaism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], and the [[Baháʼí Faith]].

There are many religious centres scattered around the city, from old to newly built centres, including [[List of religious centers in Tehran#Mosques and madrasehs|mosques]], [[List of religious centers in Tehran#Churches|churches]], [[List of religious centers in Tehran#Synagogues|synagogues]], and [[List of religious centers in Tehran#Fire temples|Zoroastrian fire temples]]. The city also has a very small third-generation Indian [[Sikh]] community with a local [[gurdwara]] that was visited by the [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]], [[Manmohan Singh]] in 2012.<ref name="Indian Prime Minister in Tehran">{{cite web|last=Lakshman|first=Nikhil|title=Indian Prime Minister in Tehran|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/slide-show/slide-show-1-how-to-organise-a-summit-the-iranian-way/20120830.htm|website=Rediff.com|access-date=3 September 2012|archive-date=3 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903043924/http://www.rediff.com/news/slide-show/slide-show-1-how-to-organise-a-summit-the-iranian-way/20120830.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
[[File:Tehran Profile, Level 1, 2012.jpg|thumb|Urban sustainability analysis of the metropolitan area of Tehran, using the 'Circles of Sustainability' method of the [[United Nations Global Compact|UN Global Compact]] Cities Programme]]
Most of Tehran has a [[semi-arid climate]], according to the [[Köppen climate classification]] (''BSh'' (hot semi-arid) in the region of the [[Mehrabad International Airport]], and ''BSk'' (cold semi-arid) in higher areas), with a borderline [[Mediterranean climate#Hot-summer Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa'') in the northern area of the city, with hot, dry summers and cool, rainy winters.<!---PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO 'COLD SEMI-ARID CLIMATE' BECAUSE THAT'S INCORRECT. TEHRAN'S AVERAGE ANNUAL TEMPERATURE OF 15.6 WHEN MULTIPLIED BY 20 GIVES A TOTAL OF 312, WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THE TOTAL ANNUAL PRECIPITATION OF 429 MM.---> Tehran's climate is largely defined by its geographic location, with the towering [[Alborz]] mountains to its north and the country's central desert to the south.

As the city has a large area, with significant differences in elevation among various districts, the weather is often cooler in the hilly north than in the flat southern part of Tehran. For instance, the {{convert|17.3|km|abbr=on}} [[Valiasr Street]] runs from Tehran's railway station at {{convert|1117|m|abbr=on}} elevation above sea level in the south of the city to [[Tajrish Square]] at 1712.6&nbsp;m (5612.3&nbsp;ft) elevation above sea level in the north.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.freemaptools.com/elevation-finder.htm|title=Elevation Finder|last=Tools|first=Free Map|website=Freemaptools.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-02|archive-date=2020-05-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200516040306/https://www.freemaptools.com/elevation-finder.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> However, the elevation can even rise up to {{convert|2000|m|abbr=on}} at the end of [[Velenjak]] in northern Tehran. The sparse texture, the existence of old gardens, orchards, green spaces along the highways and the lack of industrial activities in the north of the city have helped the air in the northern areas to be 2 to 3 degrees Celsius cooler than the southern areas of the city.<ref name="Tehran Geography">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cgie.org.ir/fa/article/27105/تهران--جغرافیا--شیوا-جعفری|title=Tehran Geography|language=fa|access-date=2018-10-11|archive-date=2018-09-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180911143144/https://www.cgie.org.ir/fa/article/27105/تهران--جغرافیا--شیوا-جعفری|url-status=live}}</ref>

The main direction of the prevailing wind in Tehran is northwest to southeast.<ref name="hamshahrionline">[https://www.hamshahrionline.ir/photo/173606/آشنایی-با-دریاچه-شهدای-خلیج-فارس-چیتگر-تهران/Chitgar lake (in Persian)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221209054656/https://www.hamshahrionline.ir/photo/173606/%D8%A2%D8%B4%D9%86%D8%A7%DB%8C%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D8%AF%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%A7%DA%86%D9%87-%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%AF%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%AE%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%AC-%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B3-%DA%86%DB%8C%D8%AA%DA%AF%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86 |date=9 December 2022 }}. hamshahrionline.ir</ref> Other air currents that blow in the area of Tehran are:

# Tochal breeze: With the rapid cooling of the Alborz mountain range at night, a local high-pressure center is formed on Mount Tochal, and this cold current flows down the mountain due to its weight and high pressure; Thus, a gentle breeze blows into the city from the north at night.<ref name="Tehran Geography"/>
# Southern and southeastern regional winds: these winds blow from the desert plains in the hot months of the year.<ref name="Tehran Geography"/>
# Western winds: These winds are among the planetary winds that affect the city of Tehran more or less throughout the year and can be called the prevailing wind.<ref name="Tehran Geography"/>

Air currents have a great effect on Tehran's weather. The prevailing wind blowing from the west causes the west of the city to always be exposed to fresh air; Although this wind brings smoke and pollution from the western industrial areas, its strong wind can take the polluted air out of the city of Tehran.<ref name="Tehran Geography"/>

In most years, winter provides half of Tehran's total annual rainfall. March is the rainiest month of the year and about one-fifth of the annual rainfall occurs in it. Summer is also the least rainy season and September is the driest month of the year in Tehran. The average annual rainfall of the city is sometimes very different in the north and south regions.<ref name="Tehran Geography"/> There are between 205 and 213 days of clear to partly cloudy weather in Tehran.<ref name="atlas.tehran.ir">[https://web.archive.org/web/20180612143424/http://atlas.tehran.ir/Default.aspx?tabid=171/ Climate and air pollution of Tehran (in Persian)]. atlas.tehran.ir</ref>

One of the most intense rains in Tehran happened on April 21, 1962 and this rain lasted for 10 hours. Meteorology also announced that the amount of rainfall on that one day in Tehran was equivalent to six years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iichs.ir/p/history.aspx?id=2|title=Institute for Iranian Contemporary Historical Studies|language=fa|access-date=2018-06-11|archive-date=2015-11-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121001916/http://www.iichs.ir/p/history.aspx?id=2|url-status=live}}</ref>

Summer is hot and dry with little rain, but [[relative humidity]] is generally low, making the heat tolerable. Average high temperatures are between {{convert|31|C}} and {{convert|38|°C}} during [[summer|summer months]], and it can sometimes rise up to {{convert|40|C}} during [[heat waves]]. Average low temperatures in summer are between {{convert|18|C}} and {{convert|25|°C}}, and it can occasionally drop to below {{convert|14|C}}&nbsp; in the mountainous north of the city at night.

Winter is cold and occasionally snowy, with an average of 12.3 snow days annually in central Tehran and more than 23.7 snow days annually in northern Tehran. During the [[winter|winter months]], average high temperatures are between {{convert|3|C}} and {{convert|11|°C}} and average low temperatures are between {{convert|-5|C}} and {{convert|1|°C}}, and it can occasionally drop to below {{convert|-10|C}}&nbsp; during [[cold waves]].

Most of the annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] occurs from late autumn to mid-spring. March is the wettest month with an average precipitation of {{convert|39.6|mm}}. The hottest month is July, with a mean minimum temperature of {{convert|24|°C}} and a mean maximum temperature of {{convert|36.7|°C}}, and the coldest is January, with a mean minimum temperature of {{convert|-0.4|°C}} and a mean maximum temperature of {{convert|7.9|°C}}.<ref name="IranTour">{{cite web|url=http://www.irantour.org/Iran/Climate.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030610002354/http://www.irantour.org/Iran/Climate.html|url-status=usurped|archive-date=2003-06-10|title=Climate of Tehran|website=Irantour.org|access-date=2010-11-12}}</ref>

[[File:Air pollution of Tehran - 5 January 2013 06.jpg|thumb|Heavy [[air pollution]] in Tehran]]
A plan to move the capital has been discussed many times in prior years, due mainly to the environmental issues of the region. Tehran is one of the world's most polluted cities and is also located near two major [[fault lines]].

The city suffers from severe air pollution, 80% of it due to cars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.payvand.com/news/09/jan/1007.html |title=Car exhaust fumes blamed for over 80% of air pollution in Tehran |website=Payvand.com |date=2006-11-22 |access-date=2010-09-25 |archive-date=2011-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629091518/http://www.payvand.com/news/09/jan/1007.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The remaining 20% is due to [[industrial pollution]]. Other estimates suggest that motorcycles alone account for 30% of air and 50% of [[noise pollution]] in Tehran.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.payvand.com/news/10/oct/1239.html |title=Motorcycles Account for 30% of Air Pollution in Tehran |website=Payvand.com |date=2006-11-22 |access-date=2010-11-12 |archive-date=2011-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107063229/http://www.payvand.com/news/10/oct/1239.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Tehran is also considered one of the strongest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the Middle East. Enhanced concentration of carbon dioxide over the city (that are likely originated from the anthropogenic urban sources in the city) is easily detectable from satellite observations throughout the year.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Labzovskii|first=Lev|date=2 August 2019|title=Working towards confident spaceborne monitoring of carbon emissions from cities using Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0034425719303785|journal=Remote Sensing of Environment|volume=233 (2019) 11359|doi=10.1016/j.rse.2019.111359 |access-date=27 January 2020|archive-date=27 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200127042353/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0034425719303785|url-status=live}}</ref>

The officials are engaged in a battle to reduce air pollution. It has, for instance, encouraged taxis and buses to convert from petrol engines to engines that run on [[compressed natural gas]]. Furthermore, the government has set up a "Traffic Zone" covering the city centre during peak traffic hours. Entering and driving inside this zone is only allowed with a special permit.

There have also been plans to raise people's awareness of the hazards of pollution. One method that is being employed is the installation of Pollution Indicator Boards all around the city to monitor the level of [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] (PM2.5/PM10), [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>), and [[carbon monoxide]] (CO).

Few foreign companies operate in Tehran, due to the government's complex international relations. But prior to the [[1979 Revolution]], many foreign companies were active in Iran.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chaichian|first1=Mohammad|title=Town and Country in the Middle East: Iran and Egypt in the Transition to Globalization|date=2009|publisher=Lexington Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7391-2677-6|pages=98–103}}</ref> Tehran's present-day modern industries include the manufacturing of automobiles, electronics and electrical equipment, weaponry, textiles, sugar, cement, and chemical products.

=== Fashion industry ===
Design, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, retail, advertising and other sectors of the [[Fashion in Iran|fashion industry in Tehran]] have been able to grow significantly according to the needs of the country. In particular, a large number of male and female models are working in Tehran's fashion advertising and promotion sections.

Following the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution]] in 1979, the political system changed from [[constitutional monarchy]] to [[Islamic republic]]. Then the construction of political power in the country needed to change so that new spectrums of political power decision-making centers emerged in Iran. Motives, desires and actions of these new political power decision-making centers in Iran, made them rename streets and public places throughout the country, especially Tehran. For example Shahyad square changed to [[Azadi Square|Azadi square]] and Pahlavi street changed to [[Valiasr Street|Valiasr street]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=M|first=Badiei Azandehi|date=2009-01-01|title=The Discourse of Streets' Naming in Tehran After Islamic Revolution|url=https://www.sid.ir/en/journal/ViewPaper.aspx?ID=176278|language=En|journal=Geopolitics Quarterly|volume=5|issue=114|pages=72–101}}</ref>

{{Main|Culture of Tehran}}
The [[culture of Tehran]] concerns the arts, music, museums, festivals, many [[Persian Culture|Persian entertainments]] and sports activities in Tehran, the capital city of Iran. [[Iranian Festivals|Iranian festivals]] are held in Tehran along with regional and western festivals. [[Nowruz]], [[Chaharshanbe Suri]], [[Sizdah Be-dar]], [[Yaldā Night]], [[Valentine's Day]] and [[Halloween]] have been popular festivals in recent decades.<ref name="Tehran Culture">{{Cite book |title=فرهنگ عامه مردم تهران - ۹۸}}</ref>

=== Architecture ===
{{See also|Architecture of Tehran}}
The oldest surviving architectural monuments of Tehran are from the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] and [[Pahlavi dynasty|Pahlavi]] eras. In Greater Tehran, monuments dating back to the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] era remain as well; notably the [[Tughrul Tower|Toqrol Tower]] in Ray. [[Rashkan Castle]], dating back to the ancient [[Parthian Empire]], of which some artifacts are housed at the [[National Museum of Iran|National Museum]];<ref>{{cite book|title=Ancien Rey |first= Hossein|last= Karimian |chapter= Anjomane Asare Melli}}{{full citation needed|date=January 2020}}</ref> and the [[Bahram fire temple]], which remains since the [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanian Empire]].

Tehran only had a small population until the late 18th century but began to take a more considerable role in Iranian society after it was chosen as the capital city. Despite the regular occurrence of earthquakes during the Qajar period and after, some historic buildings remain from that era.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/articles/article/Iran/Tehran-Capital-City-of-Iran/128 |title= A guide to Iran – etiquette, customs, clothing and more… |website= Kwintessential.co.uk |access-date= 2007-12-16 |archive-date= 2007-10-17 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071017070645/http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/articles/article/Iran/Tehran-Capital-City-of-Iran/128 |url-status= live }}</ref>

Tehran is Iran's [[primate city]], and is considered to have the most modernized infrastructure in the country. However, the [[gentrification]] of old neighbourhoods and the demolition of buildings of cultural significance have caused concerns.<ref>{{cite web |last=Urschel |first=Donna |url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0408/iran.html |title=The Style of Tehran – Library of Congress |website=Loc.gov |access-date=2012-05-21 |archive-date=2012-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819051336/http://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0408/iran.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

It was eventually demolished and replaced with a bank building in 1947, following the reforms during the reign of [[Reza Shah]].

Before the 1979 Revolution, the Iranian national stage had become the most famous performing scene for known international artists and troupes in the Middle East,<ref>{{Cite book |author=Kiann, Nima |date=2015 |title=The History of Ballet in Iran |publisher=Reichert Verlag |place=Wiesbaden, Germany}}</ref> with the Vahdat Hall, formerly known as Rudaki Hall, constructed to function as the national stage for opera and ballet. The hall was inaugurated in October 1967 and named after prominent Persian poet [[Rudaki]]. It is home to the [[Tehran Symphony Orchestra]], the Tehran Opera Orchestra, and the [[Iranian National Ballet Company]].

The [[City Theater of Tehran]], one of Iran's biggest theatre complexes, which contains several performance halls, was opened in 1972. It was built at the initiative and presidency of empress [[Farah Pahlavi]], and was designed by architect Ali Sardar Afkhami, constructed within five years.

One of the gathering centers of [[Cabaret|cabarets]] in old Tehran was [[Laleh-Zar Street]]. Famous Persian cabarets were active in the city until 1979. They also introduced many domestic artists. In common language, cabaret was sometimes called "home of dance" or "dancing place".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Entekhab.ir |first=پایگاه خبری تحلیلی انتخاب {{!}} |date=2023-05-29 |title=گزارشی از شب های تهران ۴۷ سال پیش / آمارهای قابل توجه درمورد تهرانی ها و خرج هایی که صرف خوشگذرانی می کردند |url=http://www.entekhab.ir/fa/news/657920 |access-date=2023-05-29 |website=fa |language=fa}}</ref>
