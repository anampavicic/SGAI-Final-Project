'''Petrolina''' is a municipality located in the southernmost point of the state of [[Pernambuco]], in [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]] [[Brazil]], in the valley of the [[São Francisco River]]. The population was 354,317 in 2020, and the total area is {{formatnum:4756.8}}&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ambientebrasil.com.br/municipios/index.php3?action=imprimir_item&item_id=2998 |title=Ambientebrasil - portal ambiental |access-date=2006-12-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200431/http://www.ambientebrasil.com.br/municipios/index.php3?action=imprimir_item&item_id=2998 |archive-date=2007-09-27 }}</ref> making it the largest municipality in the state by area. The municipality is closely integrated with [[Juazeiro]], [[Bahia]], located on the opposite bank of the São Francisco.

== Etymology ==
Formerly called {{lang|pt|Passagem de Juazeiro}} ({{Literal translation|Passage of Juazeiro}}), there is no single story explaining the origin of the name Petrolina. One theory is that the name was in tribute of Brazilian emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]] and his consort [[Maria Leopoldina of Austria|Leopoldina]], while another asserts that Petrolina was named for a 'beautiful rock' ({{Langx|pt|Pedra linda}}) found on the banks of the São Francisco.<ref>{{Cite web |title=História |publisher=Municipal Prefecture of Petrolina |url=https://petrolina.pe.gov.br/historia/ |access-date=2021-04-22 |language=pt-BR }}</ref>

== History ==
The growth of Petrolina and its twin city [[Juazeiro]] in the late 20th century is the result of the construction of the [[Sobradinho Dam]] and the abundant availability of water for irrigation in these otherwise semi-arid soils. The region is perhaps the only one in the interior of the Northeast that has gained population through in-migration. While the population in the states of Pernambuco and Bahia as a whole increased by 50.1% between 1970 and 1990, it more than doubled in Petrolina-Juazeiro.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

For many years the economy of the Valley of the São Francisco was based on extensive [[Ranch|cattle ranching]] and [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farming]].

Starting in the 1960s with the development policies implemented by the government, the valley soon became the beneficiary of important investments for economic development, translated into the construction of highways, increasing electrical energy, improvement in sanitation systems etc.

Investments made in the agricultural sector with the implantation of the irrigated sections of Bebedouro and Senador Nilo Coelho, in turn brought in the installation of factories connected to the regional agriculture base, especially producers of tomato paste, juices, textiles etc.

Agriculture has grown by leaps and bounds with irrigated farming being the main source of income and jobs in Petrolina. The Petrolina-Juazeiro nucleus has turned into a producer of a wide range of irrigated high-value crops, including table grapes and mangos that are sold fresh by cargo aircraft to [[Europe]] and the United States, and other crops for the domestic market, including bananas, coconuts, guavas, passion fruit, melons, industrial tomatoes, watermelons and onions, among others. Due to irrigation, growers in Petrolina-Juazeiro produce 90% of the country's exports of mangos and 30% of table grapes, displacing the states of São Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul as the most important exporters of these products.

Petrolina is situated on the left (northern) bank of the [[São Francisco River]], in the interior semi-arid ''[[Sertão]]'' subregion, at an elevation of 376 m.
On the other side of the river sits [[Juazeiro]], in [[Bahia|state of Bahia]], and together the cities form an integrated metropolitan area. The two cities, making up an urban area of almost 700,000 people, are connected by the President Dutra Bridge. The [[Sobradinho Dam]] is located 26 km up river, and creates the [[Sobradinho Reservoir]], the 34th [[List of reservoirs by volume|largest reservoir by volume]] in the world.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Chao|first1=B.
