Its territory covers the classical land of [[Khwarazm]], which in classical [[Persian literature]] was known as {{transliteration|fa|Kāt}} ({{lang|fa|کات}}).

The name ''Karakalpakstan'' means "land of the [[Karakalpaks]]". Although most Karakalpaks reside in Uzbekistan, Karakalpak culture and language are closer to those of the [[Kazakhs]] and [[Nogais|Noghais]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Glottolog 4.8 - Kara-Kalpak |url=https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/kara1467 |access-date=2023-10-31 |website=glottolog.org}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Kyzyl-Kala under restoration (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Ancient fortress of [[Kyzyl-Kala]] (1st–4th century AD), under restoration (2018)]]
From about 500 BC to 500 AD, the region of what is now Karakalpakstan was a thriving agricultural area supported by extensive irrigation.<ref name="Bolton"/> It was strategically important territory and fiercely contested, as is seen by the more than 50 [[Desert castles of ancient Khorezm|Khorezm fortresses]] which were constructed here. The [[Karakalpaks|Karakalpak people]], who used to be nomadic herders and fishers, were first recorded by foreigners in the 16th century.<ref name="Mayhew"/> Karakalpakstan was ceded to the [[Russian Empire]] by the [[Khanate of Khiva]] in 1873.<ref name="Richardson">{{cite book |last1=Richardson |first1=David |last2=Richardson |first2=Sue |year=2012 |title=Qaraqalpaqs of the Aral Delta |publisher=Prestel Verlag |isbn=978-3-7913-4738-7 |page=68}}</ref> 

Under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule, it was an [[Karakalpak Autonomous Oblast|autonomous area]] within the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] before becoming part of [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbekistan]] in 1936 as the [[Karakalpak Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Karakalpak ASSR]].<ref name="Europa">{{cite book |title=Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia |author=Europa Publications Limited |year=2002 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=1-85743-137-5 |page=536 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EPP3ti4hysUC&q=karakalpakstan |access-date=3 March 2012 |archive-date=16 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210416045037/https://books.google.com/books?id=EPP3ti4hysUC&q=karakalpakstan |url-status=live }}</ref> 

The region was probably at its most prosperous in the 1960s and 1970s, when irrigation from the [[Amu Darya]] was being expanded.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} However, the evaporation of the [[Aral Sea]] has made Karakalpakstan one of Uzbekistan's poorest regions.<ref name="Mayhew">{{cite book |title=Central Asia: Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan |last=Mayhew |first=Bradley |year=2007 |publisher=[[Lonely Planet]] |isbn=978-1-74104-614-4 |page=258 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwX-UTmC1GwC&q=karakalpakstan |access-date=3 March 2012 |archive-date=16 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210416045039/https://books.google.com/books?id=DwX-UTmC1GwC&q=karakalpakstan |url-status=live }}</ref> 

The region is suffering from extensive drought, partly due to climate patterns, but also largely because the Amu Darya and [[Syr Darya]] rivers are mostly diverted in the eastern parts of Uzbekistan. Crop failures have deprived about 48,000 people of their main source of income and shortages of potable water have created a surge of infectious diseases.<ref name="Thomas">{{cite book |title=Warlords rising: confronting violent non-state actors |last=Thomas |first=Troy S. |author2=Kiser, Stephen D. |author3=Casebeer, William D. |year=2005 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=0-7391-1190-6 |pages=30, 147–148 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sgkIZDGtD1IC&q=karakalpakstan |access-date=3 March 2012 |archive-date=16 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210416045033/https://books.google.com/books?id=sgkIZDGtD1IC&q=karakalpakstan |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Economy ==
[[File:Karakalpakstan Kyzyl Qala Cotton Picking.jpg|thumb|Cotton picking near [[Kyzyl-Kala]]]]
The economy of the region used to be heavily dependent on [[fisheries]] in the Aral Sea. It is now supported by [[cotton]], [[rice]], and fruits, such as plums, pears, grapes, and apricots, in addition to all kinds of melons. [[Hydroelectric power]] comes from a large [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-built station on the [[Amu Darya]], which was once heavily populated and supported extensive [[irrigation]] based agriculture for thousands of years. Under the [[Khorezm]], the area attained considerable power and prosperity. 

However, [[climate change]] over the centuries, accelerated by human induced evaporation of the [[Aral Sea]] in the late 20th century has created a desolate scene in the region. The ancient oases of rivers, lakes, reed marshes, forests and farms are drying up and being poisoned by wind-borne salt and by [[fertilizer]] and [[pesticide]] residues from the dried bed of the Aral Sea. Summer temperatures have risen by {{cvt|10|C-change|F-change}} and winter temperatures have decreased by {{cvt|10|C-change|F-change}}. The rates of incidence of [[anemia]], [[respiratory disease]]s and other health problems has risen dramatically.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pearce |first=Fred |author-link=Fred Pearce |title=When the Rivers Run Dry: Water, the Defining Crisis of the Twenty-first Century |publisher=[[Beacon Press]] |year=2007 |page=211 |isbn=978-0-8070-8573-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C0_q-90H1aAC&q=karakalpakstan |access-date=28 November 2020 |archive-date=16 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210416045032/https://books.google.com/books?id=C0_q-90H1aAC&q=karakalpakstan |url-status=live }}</ref>
