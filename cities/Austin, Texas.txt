Austin, Travis County and Williamson County have been the site of human habitation since at least 9200 BC. The area's earliest known inhabitants lived during the late [[Pleistocene]] (Ice Age) and are linked to the [[Clovis culture]] around 9200 BC (over 11,200 years ago), based on evidence found throughout the area and documented at the much-studied [[Gault (archaeological site)|Gault Site]], midway between [[Georgetown, Texas|Georgetown]] and [[Fort Cavazos]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=June 15, 2010 |title=Handbook of Texas Online, "Gault Site" entry |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/bbgya |access-date=July 18, 2010 |doi=<!-- Texas+State+History+Association --> |archive-date=July 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710065631/http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/bbgya |url-status=live }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=September 2020}}

In 1835–1836, Texans fought and won [[Texas Revolution|independence from Mexico]]. Texas thus became an independent country with its own president, congress, and monetary system.

Austin]], the "Father of Texas" and the republic's first secretary of state.

The city grew throughout the 19th century and became a center for government and education with the construction of the [[Texas State Capitol]] and the [[University of Texas at Austin]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=History Lesson |url=http://www.austintexas.org/travel_trade/why_austin/historyheritage |access-date=July 28, 2008 |publisher=Austin Convention & Visitors Bureau |archive-date=May 1, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501122959/http://www.austintexas.org/travel_trade/why_austin/historyheritage |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Austin old capital.png|thumb|Second capitol building in Austin]]

[[Edwin Waller]] was picked by Lamar to survey the village and draft a plan laying out the new capital.<ref name="HOT: Austin" /> The original site was narrowed to {{convert|640|acres|-1|abbr=on}} that fronted the Colorado River between two creeks, [[Shoal Creek, Austin, Texas|Shoal Creek]] and [[Waller Creek]], which was later named in his honor. Waller and a team of surveyors developed Austin's first [[city plan]], commonly known as the [[Waller Plan]], dividing the site into a 14-block grid plan bisected by a broad north–south thoroughfare, Congress Avenue, running up from the river to Capital Square, where the new Texas State Capitol was to be constructed. A temporary one-story capitol was erected on the corner of Colorado and 8th Streets. On August 1, 1839, the first auction of 217 out of 306 lots total was held.<ref name="HOT: Austin" /><ref name="Erlichman 2006" /> The Waller Plan designed and surveyed now forms the basis of downtown Austin.

In 1840, a series of conflicts between the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] and the [[Comanche]]s, known as the [[Council House Fight]] and the [[Battle of Plum Creek]], pushed the Comanches westward, mostly ending conflicts in Central Texas.<ref>{{Handbook of Texas|name=Plum Creek, Battle of|id=btp04|retrieved=February 17, 2010}} Texas State Historical Association.</ref> Settlement in the area began to expand quickly. Travis County was established in 1840, and the surrounding counties were mostly established within the next two decades.<ref name="HOT:Travis Co" />

Initially, the new capital thrived but Lamar's political enemy, [[Sam Houston]], used two Mexican army incursions to [[San Antonio]] as an excuse to move the government. Sam Houston fought bitterly against Lamar's decision to establish the capital in such a remote wilderness. The men and women who traveled mainly from Houston to conduct government business were intensely disappointed as well. By 1840, the population had risen to 856, nearly half of whom fled Austin when Congress recessed.<ref>{{Cite web |title=City of Austin Community Inventory Report |url=http://www.imagineaustin.net/inventory-historic.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309084740/http://www.imagineaustin.net/inventory-historic.htm |archive-date=March 9, 2010 |access-date=December 11, 2009 |publisher=Austin City Connection}}</ref> The resident [[African American]] population listed in January of this same year was 176.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Austin Treasures: First Year Firsts: 1839. |url=http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/library/ahc/begin/firsts.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020109140428/http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/library/ahc/begin/firsts.htm |archive-date=January 9, 2002 |access-date=April 18, 2011 |publisher=Austin City Connections}}</ref> The fear of Austin's proximity to the Indians and Mexico, which still considered Texas a part of their land, created an immense motive for Sam Houston, the first and third President of the Republic of Texas, to relocate the capital once again in 1841. Upon threats of Mexican troops in Texas, Houston raided the Land Office to transfer all official documents to Houston for safe keeping in what was later known as the [[Archive War]], but the people of Austin would not allow this unaccompanied decision to be executed. The documents stayed, but the capital would temporarily move from Austin to Houston to [[Washington-on-the-Brazos, Texas|Washington-on-the-Brazos]]. Without the governmental body, Austin's population declined to a low of only a few hundred people throughout the early 1840s. The voting by the fourth President of the Republic, [[Anson Jones]], and Congress, who reconvened in Austin in 1845, settled the issue to keep Austin the seat of government, as well as annex the Republic of Texas into the United States.

In 1860, 38% of Travis County residents were [[slavery in the United States|slaves]].<ref>{{Cite news |year=1961 |title=Map Showing the Distribution of the Slave Population of the Southern States of the United States |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/opinion/FULLFRAMEmap.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/opinion/FULLFRAMEmap.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |access-date=December 13, 2010}}</ref> In 1861, with the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], voters in Austin and other Central Texas communities voted against secession.<ref name="HOT: Bastrop" /><ref name="HOT: Austin" /> However, as the war progressed and fears of attack by [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces increased, Austin contributed hundreds of men to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces. The African American population of Austin swelled dramatically after the enforcement of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in Texas by [[Union Army|Union]] General [[Gordon Granger]] at Galveston, in an event commemorated as [[Juneteenth]]. Black communities such as [[Wheatville, Austin|Wheatville]], Pleasant Hill, and Clarksville were established, with Clarksville being the oldest surviving freedomtown ‒ the original post-Civil War settlements founded by former African-American slaves ‒ west of the [[Mississippi River]].<ref name="HOT: Austin" /> In 1870, blacks made up 36.5% of Austin's population.<ref name="census" />

In September 1881, Austin public schools held their first classes. The same year, Tillotson Collegiate and Normal Institute (now part of [[Huston–Tillotson University]]) opened its doors. The [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] held its first classes in 1883, although classes had been held in the original wooden state capitol for four years before.<ref>Martin (2009), p. 84.</ref>

During the 1880s, Austin gained new prominence as the [[Texas State Capitol|state capitol building]] was completed in 1888 and claimed as the seventh largest building in the world.<ref name="HOT: Austin" /> In the late 19th century, Austin expanded its city limits to more than three times its former area, and the first granite dam was built on the Colorado River to power a new street car line and the new "[[Moonlight tower|moon towers]]".<ref name="HOT: Austin" /> The first dam washed away in a flood on April 7, 1900.<ref>Martin (2009), p. 107.</ref>

In the late 1920s and 1930s, Austin implemented the [[1928 Austin city plan]] through a series of civic development and beautification projects that created much of the city's infrastructure and many of its parks. In addition, the state legislature established the [[Lower Colorado River Authority]] (LCRA) that, along with the city of Austin, created the system of dams along the Colorado River to form the [[Texas Highland Lakes|Highland Lakes]]. These projects were enabled in large part because the [[Public Works Administration]] provided Austin with greater funding for municipal construction projects than other Texas cities.<ref name="HOT: Austin" />

During the early 20th century, a three-way system of social segregation emerged in Austin, with Anglos, African Americans and Mexicans being separated by custom or law in most aspects of life, including housing, health care, and education. Deed restrictions also played an important role in [[residential segregation in the United States|residential segregation]]. After 1935 most housing deeds prohibited African Americans (and sometimes other nonwhite groups) from using land.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tretter |first=Eliot |title=Shadows of a Sunbelt City - The Environment, Racism, and the Knowledge Economy in Austin |date=2016 |publisher=The University of Georgia Press |isbn=9780820344898 |page=126}}</ref> Combined with the system of segregated public services, racial segregation increased in Austin during the first half of the twentieth century, with African Americans and Mexicans experiencing high levels of discrimination and social marginalization.<ref>McDonald, Jason (2012).

In 1940, the destroyed granite dam on the Colorado River was finally replaced by a hollow concrete dam<ref>Martin (2009). p. 111.</ref> that formed Lake McDonald (now called [[Lake Austin]]) and which has withstood all floods since. In addition, the much larger Mansfield Dam was built by the LCRA upstream of Austin to form Lake Travis, a flood-control reservoir.<ref>Martin (2009), p. 112.</ref>

In the early 20th century, the [[Texas Oil Boom]] took hold, creating tremendous economic opportunities in Southeast Texas and North Texas. The growth generated by this boom largely passed by Austin at first, with the city slipping from fourth largest to tenth largest in Texas between 1880 and 1920.<ref name="HOT: Austin" />

After a severe lull in economic growth from the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], Austin resumed its steady development. Following the mid-20th century, Austin became established as one of Texas' major metropolitan centers. In 1970, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Austin's population as 14.5% Hispanic, 11.9% black, and 73.4% non-Hispanic white.<ref name="census" /> In the late 20th century, Austin emerged as an important high tech center for [[semiconductor]]s and software. The [[University of Texas at Austin]] emerged as a major university.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Austin in Texas |url=http://www.writeonaustin.org/ |access-date=April 16, 2010 |publisher=Writeonaustin.com |archive-date=June 28, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628105213/http://www.writeonaustin.org/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The 1970s saw Austin's emergence in the national music scene, with local artists such as [[Willie Nelson]], [[Asleep at the Wheel]], and [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] and iconic music venues such as the [[Armadillo World Headquarters]]. Over time, the long-running television program ''Austin City Limits'', its namesake Austin City Limits Festival, and the [[South by Southwest]] music festival solidified the city's place in the music industry.<ref name="austin history" />

Austin occupies a total area of {{convert|790.1|km2||order=flip}}. Approximately {{convert|18.6|km2|order=flip}} of this area is water.<ref name="Census 2010" />  Austin is situated at the foot of the [[Balcones Escarpment]], on the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]], with three artificial lakes within the city limits: [[Lady Bird Lake]] (formerly known as Town Lake), [[Lake Austin]] (both created by dams along the Colorado River), and [[Lake Walter E.

Austin is located within the middle of a unique, narrow transitional zone between the dry deserts of the American Southwest and the lush, green, more humid regions of the American Southeast. Its climate, topography, and vegetation share characteristics of both. Officially, Austin has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') under the [[Köppen climate classification]]. This climate is typified by long, very hot summers, short, mild winters, and warm to hot spring and fall seasons in-between. Austin averages {{convert|34.32|in|mm|0}} of annual rainfall distributed mostly evenly throughout the year, though spring and fall are the wettest seasons.

It is common for a lengthy series of warm, dry, low-humidity days to be occasionally interrupted by very warm and humid days, and vice versa. Humidity rises with winds from the east or southeast, when the air drifts inland from the [[Gulf of Mexico]], but decreases significantly with winds from the west or southwest, bringing air flowing from [[Chihuahuan Desert]] areas of [[West Texas]] or northern Mexico.<ref name="NWSC-NOAA" />

Winters in Austin are mild, although occasional short-lived bursts of cold weather known as "[[Texas Norther|Blue Norther]]s" can occur. January is the coolest month with an average daytime high of {{convert|62.5|°F|0}}. The overnight low drops to or below freezing 12 times per year,<ref name="NWSC-NOAA" /> and sinks below {{convert|45|°F|0}} during 76 evenings per year, mostly between mid-December and mid-February. The average first and last dates for a freeze are December 1 and February 15, giving Austin an average growing season of 288 days, and the coldest temperature of the year is normally about {{convert|24.2|°F|0}} under the 1991-2020 climate normals, putting Austin in USDA zone 9a.<ref name="NWSC-NOAA" /> 
Conversely, winter months also produce warm days on a regular basis. On average, 10 days in January reach or exceed {{convert|70|F|0}} and 1 day reaches {{convert|80|F|0}}; during the 1991-2020 period, all Januarys had at least 1 day with a high of {{convert|70|F|0}} or more, and most (60%) had at least 1 day with a high of {{convert|80|F|0}} or more.<ref name="NWSC-NOAA" /> The lowest ever recorded temperature in the city was {{convert|-2|°F|0}} on January 31, 1949.

Typical of [[Central Texas]], severe weather in Austin is a threat that can strike during any season. However, it is most common during the spring.

===Barton Creek Greenbelt===

The [[Barton Creek Greenbelt]] is a {{convert|7.25|mi|km|adj=on}} public [[green belt]] managed by the City of Austin's Park and Recreation Department. The Greenbelt, which begins at [[Zilker Park]] and stretches South/Southwest to the Woods of Westlake [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]], is characterized by large [[limestone]] cliffs, dense foliage, and shallow bodies of water. Popular activities include [[rock climbing]], mountain biking, and hiking. Some well known naturally forming swimming holes along Austin's greenbelt include Twin Falls, Sculpture Falls, Gus Fruh Pool, and Campbell's Hole. During years of heavy rainfall, the water level of the creek rises high enough to allow [[human swimming|swimming]], [[High diving|cliff diving]], [[kayaking]], [[Paddleboarding|paddle boarding]], and [[tubing (recreation)|tubing]].

====Highways====
[[File:Pennybacker bridge sunset 2006.jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[Pennybacker Bridge]] is the signature element of [[Texas Loop 360|Loop 360]] in the [[Texas Hill Country]].]]

Central Austin lies between two major north–south freeways: [[Interstate 35 in Texas|I-35]] to the east and the [[Texas State Highway Loop 1|Mopac Expressway (Loop 1)]] to the west. [[U.S. Route 183 in Texas|US 183]] runs from northwest to southeast, and [[Texas State Highway 71|SH 71]] crosses the southern part of the city from east to west, completing a rough "box" around central and north-central Austin. Austin is the largest city in the United States to be served by only one Interstate Highway.

[[U.S. Route 290|US 290]] enters Austin from the east and merges into I-35. Its highway designation continues south on I-35 and then becomes part of SH 71, continuing to the west. Highway 290 splits from Highway 71 in southwest Austin, in an interchange known as "The Y." SH 71 continues to [[Brady, Texas]], and Highway 290 continues west to intersect [[Interstate 10 in Texas|I-10]] near [[Junction, Texas|Junction]]. Interstate 35 continues south through [[San Antonio]] to [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] on the Texas-Mexico border. Interstate 35 is the highway link to the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex in Northern Texas. There are two links to Houston (US 290 and SH 71/I-10). US 183 leads northwest of Austin toward [[Lampasas, Texas|Lampasas]].

In the mid-1980s, construction was completed on [[Texas State Highway Loop 360|Loop 360]], a scenic highway that curves through the hill country from near the 71/Mopac interchange in the south to near the US 183/Mopac interchange in the north. The iconic [[Pennybacker Bridge]], also known as the "360 Bridge," crosses Lake Austin to connect the northern and southern portions of Loop 360.

====Tollways====

[[File:Texas45.jpg|thumb|right|Interchange of [[Interstate 35]] and [[State Highway 45 (Texas)|State Highway 45]]]]

[[Texas State Highway 130|SH 130]] is a bypass route designed to relieve [[traffic congestion]], starting from Interstate 35 just north of Georgetown and running along a parallel route to the east, where it bypasses [[Round Rock, Texas|Round Rock]], Austin, [[San Marcos, Texas|San Marcos]] and [[New Braunfels, Texas|New Braunfels]] before ending at [[Interstate 10 in Texas|I-10]] east of [[Seguin, Texas|Seguin]], where drivers could drive {{convert|30|mi|km}} west to return to I-35 in [[San Antonio]]. The first segment was opened in November 2006, which was located east of [[Austin–Bergstrom International Airport]] at Austin's southeast corner on [[Texas State Highway 71|SH 71]]. Highway 130 runs concurrently with SH 45 from [[Pflugerville, Texas|Pflugerville]] on the north until it reaches [[U.S. Route 183 in Texas|US 183]] well south of Austin, at which point [[Texas State Highway 45|SR 45]] continues west. The entire route of SH 130 is now complete. The final leg opened on November 1, 2012. The highway is noted for having a maximum speed limit of {{convert|85|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} for the entire route. The {{convert|41|mi|km|adj=on}} section of the toll road between Mustang Ridge and Seguin has a posted speed limit of {{convert|85|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, the highest posted [[speed limits in the United States|speed limit in the United States]].

[[Texas State Highway 45|SH 45]] runs east–west from just south of US 183 in [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]] to 130 inside [[Pflugerville, Texas|Pflugerville]] (just east of Round Rock). A tolled extension of State Highway Loop 1 was also created. A new southeast leg of SH 45 has recently been completed, running from US 183 and the south end of Segment 5 of TX-130 south of Austin due west to I-35 at the [[List of Farm to Market Roads in Texas#FM 1327|FM 1327]]/Creedmoor Road exit between the south end of Austin and [[Buda, Texas|Buda]]. The 183A Toll Road opened in March 2007, providing a tolled alternative to US 183 through the cities of [[Leander, Texas|Leander]] and [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]]. Currently under construction is a change to East US 290 from US 183 to the town of Manor. Officially, the tollway will be dubbed Tollway 290 with "Manor Expressway" as nickname.

Despite the overwhelming initial opposition to the toll road concept when it was first announced, all three toll roads have exceeded revenue projections.<ref name="Wear 2009" />

====Airports====
[[File:AUSCentralConcourse.JPG|thumb|The Barbara Jordan Terminal at [[Austin–Bergstrom International Airport]]]]

Austin's primary airport is [[Austin–Bergstrom International Airport]] (ABIA) ([[List of airports by IATA code: A#AU|IATA code]] '''AUS'''), located {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} southeast of the city. The airport is on the site of the former [[Bergstrom Air Force Base]], which was closed in 1993 as part of the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] process. Until 1999, [[Robert Mueller Municipal Airport]] was Austin's main airport until ABIA took that role and the old airport was shut down.<ref name="LA Times Closed" /> [[Austin Executive Airport]], along with several smaller airports outside the city center, serves general aviation traffic.

The Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority ([[CapMetro]]) provides public transportation to the city, primarily with its [[CapMetro Bus]] local bus service, the [[CapMetro Bus#CapMetro Express|CapMetro Express]] express bus system, as well as a [[bus rapid transit]] service, [[CapMetro Rapid]]. CapMetro opened a {{convert|32|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Light rail in the United States#"Hybrid rail systems"|hybrid rail]] system, [[CapMetro Rail]], in 2010.<ref name="Cap Metro All Systems Go 2009" /> The system consists of a single line serving downtown Austin, the neighborhoods of East Austin, [[North Central Austin]], and Northwest Austin plus the suburb of [[Leander, Texas|Leander]].

Since it began operations in 1985, CapMetro has proposed adding [[light rail]] services to its network. Despite support from the City Council, voters rejected light rail proposals in 2000<ref name="Clark-Madison 2000" /> and 2014.<ref name="Curington 2014" /> However, in 2020, voters approved CapMetro's {{US$|10 billion}} transit expansion plan, [[Project Connect]], by a comfortable margin. The plan proposes 2 new light rail lines, an additional bus rapid transit line (which could be converted to light rail in the future), a second commuter rail line, several new MetroRapid lines, more MetroExpress routes, and a number of other infrastructure, technology and service expansion projects.<ref name="Cap Metro Project Connect" />

[[Capital Area Rural Transportation System]] connects Austin with outlying suburbs and surrounding rural areas.

====Ride sharing====

Austin is served by several [[Ridesharing company|ride-sharing]] companies including [[Uber]] and [[Lyft]].<ref name="Uber Austin" /><ref name="Lyft Austin" /><ref name="RideAustin" /> On May 9, 2016, Uber and Lyft voluntarily ceased operations in Austin in response to a city ordinance that required ride sharing company drivers to get fingerprint checks, have their vehicles labeled, and not pick up or drop off in certain city lanes.<ref name="MacMillan 2016" /><ref name="Woodyard 2016" /> Uber and Lyft resumed service in the summer of 2017.<ref name="Samuels 2017" /> The city was previously served by [[Fasten (company)|Fasten]] until they ceased all operations in the city in March 2018.<ref name="Jechow 2018" />

Austin is also served by Electric Cab of North America's six-passenger [[electric car|electric cabs]] that operate on a flexible route from the [[Kramer station|Kramer MetroRail Station]] to [[The Domain (Austin, Texas)|Domain Northside]] and from the [[Downtown station (CapMetro Rail)|Downtown CapMetro Rail station]] and MetroRapid stops to locations between the [[Austin Convention Center]] and near Sixth and Bowie streets by [[Whole Foods]].<ref name="Denney 2018" />

[[Carsharing]] service [[Zipcar]] operates in Austin and, until 2019, the city was also served by [[Car2Go]] which kept its North American headquarters in the city even after pulling out.<ref name="Turner 2019" />

==== Parking lots ====
As of 2 November 2023, Austin (Texas) is the biggest city in the US that abolished the requirement for parking minimum - for encouraging walking, biking, public transit, lowering the cost of housing and increase the amount of housing units that can be built in the city territory. [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and [[Minneapolis]] also took this action.<ref>{{cite news |last1=FECHTER |first1=JOSHUA |title=To fight climate change and housing shortage, Austin becomes largest U.S. city to drop parking-spot requirements |url=https://www.texastribune.org/2023/11/02/austin-minimum-parking-requirements-housing-shortage/ |access-date=7 November 2023 |agency=Texas tribune |date=2 November 2023 |archive-date=November 7, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231107165314/https://www.texastribune.org/2023/11/02/austin-minimum-parking-requirements-housing-shortage/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

"Keep Austin Weird" has been a local [[motto]] for years, featured on bumper stickers and T-shirts. This motto has not only been used in promoting Austin's eccentricity and diversity, but is also meant to bolster support of local independent businesses.<ref name="weird" /> According to the 2010 book ''[[Weird City]]'' the phrase was begun by a local Austin Community College librarian, Red Wassenich, and his wife, Karen Pavelka, who were concerned about Austin's "rapid descent into commercialism and overdevelopment."<ref name="Long 2010" /> The slogan has been interpreted many ways since its inception, but remains an important symbol for many Austinites who wish to voice concerns over rapid growth and development. Austin has a long history of vocal citizen resistance to development projects perceived to degrade the environment, or to threaten the natural and cultural landscapes.<ref name="Swearingen 2010" />

According to the [[Nielsen Company]], adults in Austin read and contribute to blogs more than those in any other U.S. metropolitan area.<ref name="Nielsen Company" /> Austin residents have the highest Internet usage in all of Texas.<ref name="Nielsen Company" /> In 2013, Austin was the most active city on [[Reddit]], having the largest number of views per capita.<ref name="Dunbar 2013" />

[[South Congress]] is a shopping district stretching down South Congress Avenue from Downtown. This area is home to coffee shops, eccentric stores, restaurants, food trucks, trailers, and festivals. It prides itself on "Keeping Austin Weird," especially with development in the surrounding area(s). Many Austinites attribute its enduring popularity to the magnificent and unobstructed [[Texas Capitol View Corridors|view]] of the Texas State Capitol.<ref name="Patoski 2010" />

The [[Rainey Street Historic District]] is a neighborhood in Downtown Austin formerly consisting of [[bungalow]] style homes built in the early 20th century. Since the early 2010s, the former [[working class]] residential street has turned into a popular nightlife district. Much of the historic homes have been renovated into hotels, condominiums, bars and restaurants, many of which feature large porches and outdoor yards for patrons.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Solomon|first=Dan |date=August 25, 2015 |title=Take A Look At Austin's Rainey Street As It Was Ten Years Ago |url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-daily-post/take-a-look-at-austins-rainey-street-as-it-was-ten-years-ago/ |access-date=December 7, 2018 |website=[[Texas Monthly]]}}</ref> The Rainey Street district is also home to the Emma S.

The three-day [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]] has been held in [[Zilker Park]] every year since 2002. Every year around the end of March and the beginning of April, Austin is home to "Texas Relay Weekend."

Austin's Zilker Park Tree is a Christmas display made of lights strung from the top of a [[Moonlight tower]] in Zilker Park. The Zilker Tree is lit in December along with the "Trail of Lights," an Austin Christmas tradition. The Trail of Lights was canceled four times, first starting in 2001 and 2002 due to the September 11 Attacks, and again in 2010 and 2011 due to budget shortfalls, but the trail was turned back on for the 2012 holiday season.<ref>[http://www.austintexas.gov/event/trail-lights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025092601/http://www.austintexas.gov/event/trail-lights|date=October 25, 2014}}</ref>

From 1962 to 1998, the [[Austin Aqua Festival]], or "Aqua Fest", took place on the shores of Town Lake (now known as [[Lady Bird Lake]]). Originally conceived as a summer tourism draw, the multi-day event evolved from water-themed activities to a broader civic festival due to growth and community interest. Eventually attendance and financial solvency began to dwindle as larger music and summer festivals grew in prominence.

==Government==

===City government===
{{See also|List of mayors of Austin, Texas|Austin City Council}}
[[File:AustinTXCityHall.JPG|thumb|Austin City Hall]]

Austin is administered by an 11-member [[city council]] (10 council members elected by geographic district plus a mayor elected at large). The council is accompanied by a hired [[city manager]] under the [[council-manager government|manager-council system of municipal governance]]. Council and mayoral elections are non-partisan, with a runoff in case there is no majority winner. A referendum approved by voters on November 6, 2012, changed the council composition from six council members plus a mayor elected at large to the current "10+1" district system. Supporters maintained that the at-large system would increase participation for all areas of the city, especially for those which had lacked representation from City Council.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2013-02-01/the-road-to-10-1/|title=The bumpy ride toward Austin's redistricted future|website=www.austinchronicle.com|access-date=February 8, 2023|archive-date=February 8, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230208032808/https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2013-02-01/the-road-to-10-1/|url-status=live}}</ref>

November 2014 marked the first election under the new system. The [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]] had forced San Antonio and Dallas to abandon at-large systems before 1987; however, the court could not show a racist pattern in Austin and upheld the city's at-large system during a 1984 lawsuit. In five elections between 1973 and 1994 Austin voters rejected single-member districts.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Greenberger |first=Scott S. |date=April 6, 1997 |title=From the archives: Austin faces ghost of racial history in City Council contest |work=Austin American-Statesman |url=https://www.statesman.com/news/local/austin-faces-ghost-racial-history-city-council-contest/RZ8CjQ4DWOnIAPdMYKvy4H/ |access-date=August 26, 2018 |archive-date=August 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180827110335/https://www.statesman.com/news/local/austin-faces-ghost-racial-history-city-council-contest/RZ8CjQ4DWOnIAPdMYKvy4H/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

====Issues====
A controversial turning point in the political history of the Austin area was the [[2003 Texas redistricting]]. Before then, Austin had been entirely or almost entirely within the borders of a single congressional district–what was then the 10th District–for over a century. Opponents characterized the resulting district layout as excessively partisan [[gerrymandering]], and the plan was challenged in court by Democratic and minority activists. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has never struck down a redistricting plan for being excessively partisan. The plan was subsequently upheld by a three-judge federal panel in late 2003, and on June 28, 2006, the matter was largely settled when the Supreme Court, in a 7–2 decision, upheld the entire congressional redistricting plan with the exception of a Hispanic-majority district in southwest Texas. This affected Austin's districting, as U.S. Rep. [[Lloyd Doggett]]'s district (U.S. Congressional District 25) was found to be insufficiently compact to compensate for the reduced [[minority influence]] in the southwest district; it was redrawn so that it took in most of southeastern Travis County and several counties to its south and east.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Stohr |first=Greg |date=June 28, 2006 |title=Republican Texas Redistricting Upheld by Top Court |publisher=Bloomberg |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=ah1suoNgrH7g |access-date=July 24, 2008}}</ref>

====Environmental movement====
The distinguishing political movement of Austin politics has been that of the [[environmental movement]], which spawned the parallel neighborhood movement, then the more recent conservationist movement (as typified by the Hill Country Conservancy),<ref>{{Cite news |last=Zaragosa |first=Sara |date=August 28, 2009 |title=Conservancy shifts into high gear; Efforts steer land away from development |work=Austin Business Journal |url=http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2009/08/31/story4.html |access-date=July 25, 2010 |archive-date=August 28, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828183400/http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2009/08/31/story4.html |url-status=live }}</ref> and eventually the current ongoing debate about "sense of place" and preserving the Austin quality of life. Much of the environmental movement has matured into a debate on issues related to saving and creating an Austin "sense of place."<ref name="Swearingen 2010" /> In 2012, Austin became just one of a few cities in [[Texas]] to ban the sale and use of plastic bags.
