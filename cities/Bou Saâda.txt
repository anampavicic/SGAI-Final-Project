'''Bou Saada''' ({{langx|ar|بو سعادة}}, ''bu s‘adah'', meaning "place of happiness<ref name=populstat/>") is a town and municipality in [[M'Sila Province]], [[Algeria]], situated 245&nbsp;km south of [[Algiers]]. As '''Arena''' it was the site of a city and bishopric in Roman Africa, now a Catholic [[titular see]]. The municipal population was estimated at 134,000 in 2008.

== Geography ==
Bou-Saada is located in the southwest of the [[Hodna]] region in the [[Hautes Plaines|Hauts Plateaux]], at the feet of the [[Ouled Naïl Range]] of the [[Saharan Atlas]].

Bou-Saada has traditionally been an important market place producing and selling jewelry, metalwork, carpets and bousaadi knives. There is also a textile mill in town. Even in modern times, Bou-Saada is an important trading post for nomads. There is also some national tourism during winter.
Bou-Saada is well-connected with other urban centres by road. M'Sila is 70&nbsp;km northeast, Biskra is 175&nbsp;km east, Bordj Bou Arreridj 130&nbsp;km northeast and Djelfa 120&nbsp;km southwest.
Bou-Saada has two quarters, the old [[Medina quarter|medina]] ([[ksar]]) within the city walls with arched alleyways, and the French town to the south. Surrounding the town are extensive date groves.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
Arena was important enough in the Late Roman province of [[Mauretania Caesariensis]] to be one of the many [[suffragan]]s of its capital [[Caesarea Mauretaniae]]'s Metropolitan Archbishopric; discontinued as a consequence of the [[Early Muslim conquests|Arab conquest of North Africa]].

=== Titular see ===
The diocese was nominally restored in 1933 as Latin Catholic [[titular bishopric]].

It has had the following incumbents, of the fitting episcopal (lowest) rank :
* Luís António de Almeida (1935.10.04 – 1941.04.19)
* Joseph-Conrad Chaumont (1941.06.28 – 1966.10.08)
* György Zemplén (1969.01.10 – 1973.03.29)
* Roger-Émile Aubry, [[Redemptorists]] (C.SS.R.) (1973.06.14 – 2010.02.17)
* Mário Antônio da Silva (2010.06.09 – ...), [[Auxiliary Bishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manaus|Manaus]] (Brazil)

== Rock art ==
In the municipality, located not far from the village of Ben Srour, are several [[petroglyph]] sites of archaeological interest.<ref>Tixier, J.
