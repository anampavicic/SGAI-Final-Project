'''Dimapur''' ({{IPAc-en|d|i|m|ə|ˈ|p|ʊər}}) is the largest [[city]] and [[municipality]] in the Indian state of [[Nagaland]]. As of 2024 , the municipality had a population of 172000. The city is the main gateway and commercial centre of Nagaland. Located near the border with [[Assam]] along the banks of the [[Dhansiri River]]. Its [[Dimapur railway station|main railway station]] is the second busiest station in [[Northeast India]].

==Etymology==

Many historians explain the name 'Dimapur' as the city of the [[Dimasa people]]. The compound word is derived from the Dimasa Kachari words: di (water), ma (big), and pur (settlement).{{sfn|Bathari|2014|pp=17-18}}

In the [[Ahom people|Ahom]] [[Buranji]]s, Dimapur is referred to sometimes as ''Che-din-chi-pen'' (town-earth-burn-make) meaning "Brick-town" and its rulers as ''khun timisa''<ref name=":0">{{harvcol|Ramirez|2007|p=93}}</ref> (distorted word for Dimasa).<ref name="donboscodimapur">{{cite web |title=SALESIAN PROVINCE OF DIMAPUR |url=http://www.donboscodimapur.org/history/ |publisher=donboscodimapur.org |access-date=18 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324102418/http://www.donboscodimapur.org/history/ |archive-date=24 March 2014 }}</ref>

==History==
Situated on the banks of the [[Dhansiri River|Dhansiri]] (originally known as ''Dong-siri'' meaning a ravine of peaceful habitation), Dimapur was described as the 'Brick City' by the European scholars and by the [[Ahom kingdom|Ahoms]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Bodo |first=Phirmi |date=2021-10-15 |title=Dimapur: Memories of a brick city |url=https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/dimapur-memories-of-a-brick-city/article37002014.ece |access-date=2024-09-10 |work=The Hindu |language=en-IN |issn=0971-751X}}</ref>{{citation needed|date= September 2022}}

According to local legend, Dimapur is said to have been named after the [[Mahabharatha]] character [[Hidimba]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Tribal development administration in India |date=1994 |publisher=Mittal Publications |isbn=978-81-7099-470-1 |editor-last=Basu |editor-first=Ashok Ranjan |edition=1st |location=New Delhi, India |editor-last2=Nijhawan |editor-first2=Satish}}</ref> It was first called "Hidimbapur" (Pronounced as Hirhimbapur),<ref>{{Cite book |title=Encyclopaedic ethnography of the Himalayan tribes |date=2004 |publisher=Global Vision Publ.

Later, it changed to Dimbapur, and then to Dimapur.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thenortheasttoday.com/states/nagaland/did-you-know-how-dimapur-got-its-name/cid2543747.htm|title=DID YOU KNOW How Dimapur got its name?|access-date=18 October 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Barkataki |first=S. |title=Assam |publisher=National Book Trust, India |year=1969 |isbn=9780842611428}}</ref> Another legend says that the place is related to [[Hidimbi]], the sister of Hidimba who later married the [[Pandava]] prince [[Bhima]] and gave birth to [[Ghatotkacha]].{{sfn|Bathari|2014|pp=17–18}}

During Arjuna's exile, he married Chitrangada, a princess of Manipur.

===Medieval period===
====Capital of the Kachari Kingdom====
In the 13th century, the city was the capital of the [[Dimasa Kingdom]].<ref>District Dimapur, [https://dimapur.nic.in/history/ History], dimapur.nic.in, India, retrieved February 12, 2021</ref> In the heart of the city there is an old relic of the Dimasa Kingdom which speaks about the once prosperous era.<ref>{{harvcol|Shin|2020|p=63}}</ref>

The city of Dimapur is said to have been founded by a Kachari king Mahamanipha (1330-1370) and it remained as the capital of the Kacharis until it was captured by the [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom]] ruler [[Suhungmung]] in 1526 A.D.<ref>"This city is probably the one mentioned in the Ahom Buranji, which records that Ahom king Suhungmung (alias Dihingia Rāja) and his son reached the city by ascending the river Timā (Dima or Dhansiri) in 1526 when the Ahoms attacked Dimapur."{{harvcol|Shin|2020|p=63}}</ref>

====With the Ming dynasty and Kingdom of Ava (1400–1500)====

It appears that Chinese [[Ming dynasty]] had political contacts with the Dimasa and other neighbouring kingdoms between 1406 and 1439.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mukherjee|first=Rila|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7xeqhnYtrKcC&pg=PA147|title=Pelagic Passageways: The Northern Bay of Bengal Before Colonialism|date=2011|publisher=Primus Books|isbn=978-93-80607-20-7|pages=147|language=en}}</ref> The [[Ming dynasty]] canonised the Dimasa kingdom as a [[tusi]] in 1406.<ref>{{harvcol|Laichen|2000|p=79}}</ref> A Pacification superintendency was established in the Dimasa kingdom and Lawangpa was  appointed as the Di-ma-sa Pacification Superintendent.<ref>"As the regions of Da Gu-la and Di-ma-sa were broad, pacification superintendencies were established there, while in Xiao Gu-la, Cha-shan, Di-ban, Meng-lun and Ba-jia-ta, Chief's Offices were established.

Further, paper money and silks as appropriate, were conferred upon them all."{{harvcol|Wade|1994|pp=302}}</ref> and in return, the chieftain of Dimasa sent horses and local products as a sign of tribute.<ref>The chieftains sent separately by Po-di-na-lang, the pacification superintendent of Da Gu-la; La-wang-pa, the pacification superintendent of Di-ma-sa; Bai-zhang, the chief of Xiao Gu-la; and Zao-zhang, the chief of Cha-shan, offered tribute of horses and local products in gratitude for the Imperial grace manifested in the conferring of posts upon them."{{harvcol|Wade|1994|p=432}}</ref> In 1425, paper money, ramie-silks, silk gauzes and thin silk were conferred to Mazhiasa who was sent to the Ming court by Diedaomangpa, the acting head of Di-ma-sa Pacification Superintendency.<ref>"Paper money, ramie- silks, silk gauzes and thin

It is speculated that Dimasa kingdom is referred to as ''Timmasala'' in the [[Yan Aung Myin Shwe Lett Hla Pagoda|Yan-anng-myin pagoda]] inscription of [[Myanmar|Burma]] in 1400 A.D.<ref>"The Yan-anng-myin pagoda inscription at Themaungan, south of Pinya, claims that in 1400 A.D. the rule of the king extended beyond the Kandu (Kadu, an ethnic group
in northern Burma) and the “Palaung who grow tails,” to the “heretic kingdoms of the naked Nagas on the borders of Khamti Khun kyuiw, as far as the heretic kingdom called Timmasala where they kill people and turn into spirits.” This Timmasala should be
identified with the Dimasa Kacharis of Upper Assam."{{harvcol|Laichen|2000|pp=21–22}}</ref><ref>"The ''Khaṁtī'' mentioned after ''Muiwkon'' (Mogaung) and ''Muin Can'' (Maing Zin) in the Kyankse Hill inscription (List 1084a 5, 955 s.), is doubtless Singkaling Khamti. The recently discovered Yan-aung-myin pagoda inscription at Thèmaunggan, south of Pinya (Obverse, line 8, 762 s.), claims that in 1400 A.D. the rule of the king extended beyond the ''Kandu'' (Kadu) and the ''Ponlon amri yols'' ("Palaungs who grow tails"), to the "heretic kingdoms of the Naked Nagas on the borders of ''Khamti Khun lcyviw  (?)'', as far as the heretic kingdom called ''Timmasàla'' where they kill people and turn into spirits," i.e., the Dimasa Kacharis of Upper Assam."{{harvcol|Luce|1958|p=174}}</ref> In this inscription by [[Minkhaung I]], the kingdom of [[Kingdom of Ava|Ava]] is said to extend on the east to Shan Pyi, northwest to Timmasala, west to Kula Pyi,  and south to Talaing Pyi.<ref>"At, or shortly after, his formal ascension, Mingaung the First claimed in the same inscription noted above that “Myanma Pyi” extended on the east to “Shan Pyi,” on the northwest to “Timmasala” (Assam?), on the west to “Kula Pyi,” and on the south to “Talaing Pyi.” What these entities might have been depends on the word pyi. Since Pagan times, the Old Burmese word pran (pyi) has been used in both a concrete, geopolitical
and cultural sense (as it is here), as well as in a abstract way, such as in the phrase nibban pyi (the state of nirvana)."{{harvcol|Aung-Thwin|2017|p=71}}</ref>

[[File:Burma in 1450.png|thumb|Ava in 1400s]]

In a 1442 inscription from [[Bagan|Pagan]] of [[Myanmar|Burma]] mentions Timmasala (Hill Kacharis) to be one of the 21 principalities under [[Mong Mao]] ruler  [[Mong Mao#List of Monarchs|Thonganbwa]] (1413–1445/6),<ref>"On Tuesday the [5th] waxing of Tagu he captured the capital of Suiw Khut called Kale. On Thursday the 7th waxing of the month, he captured the ''Mo''[Mong Mao] king Suiw Nam Phwa, own grandson of the lord of Nine Hundred Thousand, Suiw Khan Phwa (Thonganbwa), ruler of the 21 Umbrellas:- Muin Mo, Muin Nan; the ocean-ordered anklet wearing Kula (Indians) and Timmasala (Hill Kacharis); Muin Kale; Kasan (Manipur); Kakran (Kachin); Muin Tin; Muin Pran; Muin Ti; Muin Na; Muin Myan; Kyra Uiw; Muin Nuiw; Muin Luiw; Muin Saou; Muin Ya; Muin Khruin; Muin Khun; Muin Yuiw;........Many of these 'Umbrellas', i.e independent states can be identified :- Maw (Lu-ch'uan); Mohnyin (Mengyang); Kula and Dimasa; Kalemyo; Manipur; Kachin - these are unmistakeable"{{harvcol|Luce|Htway|1976|p=214}}</ref> who was later captured by the Governor of [[Taungdwingyi|Taungdwin]] and presented to King [[Narapati I of Ava]].<ref>"Thonganbwa and the chief of Kale were soon afterwards taken by the governor (of Taungdwin) to the presence of King Narapadi, who was then sojourning in a temporary palace on Minwun hill, and on Sunday, the 12th waxing of Kason, several elephants and ponies and a quantity of jewellery obtained from Kale were presented to the king."{{harvcol|Nyein Maung|1998|p=38}}</ref>
 
The ruins of Dimasa Kingdom in Dimapur include a brick wall of the length of nearly 2 miles and 2 tanks about 300 yards square, are indicative of a city of considerable size.<ref>"However, no clear trace of temples and images in the Dimapur ruins raises doubt about the scale and intensity of Brahmanisation in the early history of the Dimasas. The ruins of Dimapur, which include a brick wall of the aggregate length of nearly 2 miles and 2 tanks about 300 yards square, are indicative of a city of considerable size."   {{harvcol|Shin|2020|p=63}}</ref>

=== 20th century ===
==== World War II ====
During [[World War II]], Dimapur was the centre of action between [[British India]] and [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]]. It was the staging post for the Allied offensive. The Japanese could reach [[Kohima]] where a siege was laid. Allied reinforcement came through Dimapur by rail and road for the push against the Japanese. An airport at Dimapur was also in use for supplies to the allied forces in [[Myanmar|Burma]]. The [[Battle of Kohima]] about 77&nbsp;km from Dimapur is considered the turning point for the Japanese retreat from [[Southeast Asia]].{{citation needed|date= September 2022}}
