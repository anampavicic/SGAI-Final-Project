'''Matanzas''' (Cuban {{IPA|es|maˈtansas}}; {{langx|luq|Ayá Áta}})<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anagó: vocabulario lucumí: El yoruba que se habla en Cuba|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YAqtDwAAQBAJ&dq=%22ain%C3%A1+yogo%22&pg=PT32|publisher=Linkgua|date=2019-04-01|isbn=978-84-9007-834-1|author=Cabrera, Lydia|lang=es}}</ref> is the capital of the [[Cuba]]n province of [[Matanzas Province|Matanzas]]. Known for its poets, culture, and [[Afro-American religions|Afro-Cuban folklore]], it is located on the northern shore of the island of [[Cuba]], on the Bay of Matanzas (Spanish ''Bahia de Matanzas''), {{convert|90|km|mi}} east of the capital [[Havana]] and {{convert|32|km|mi}} west of the resort town of [[Varadero]].

Matanzas is called the ''City of Bridges'', for the seventeen bridges that cross the three rivers that traverse the city (Rio Yumuri, San Juan, and Canimar). For this reason it was referred to as the "Venice of Cuba." It was also called "La Atenas de Cuba" ("The Athens of Cuba") for its poets.

Matanzas is known as the birthplace of the music and dance traditions [[danzón]] and [[Cuban rumba|rumba]].

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Matanzas}}
[[File:Parque Libertad (5978575312).jpg|thumb|left|Libertad Square in Matanzas city]]
[[File:Necropolis de San Carlos Borromeo 2007.jpg|thumb|left|[[Necropolis de San Carlos Borromeo]]]]

Matanzas was founded in 1693  as ''San Carlos y San Severino de Matanzas''.<ref name=guije/>  This followed a royal decree ("''[[real cédula]]''") issued on September 25, 1690, which decreed that the bay and port of Matanzas be settled by 30 families from the [[Canary Islands]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cubagenweb.org/Matanzas/index.htm|title=Matanzas|website=www.cubagenweb.org}}</ref>

Matanzas was one of the regions that saw intensive development of sugar plantations during the colonial era. Consequently, many African slaves were imported to support the sugar industry, particularly during the first half of the nineteenth century. For example, in 1792 there were 1900 slaves in Matanzas, roughly 30% of its population. In 1817, the slave population of Matanzas had grown to 10,773, comprising nearly 50% of the overall population. By 1841, 53,331 slaves made up 62.7% of the population of Matanzas.<ref name=Bergard>Bergad, Laird W. ''Cuban Rural Society in the Nineteenth Century: The Social and Economic History of Monoculture in Matanzas''. Princeton University Press, 1990.</ref> Census figures for 1859 put the Matanzas slave population at 104,519.<ref name=Bergard/> Matanzas was the site of several slave insurrections and plots, including the infamous ''Escalera'' conspiracy<sub>([[:es:Conspiración de la Escalera|es]])</sub> (discovered in late 1843, see also [[Year of the Lash]]). Due to the high number of both slaves and, importantly, free Afro-Cubans in Matanzas, the retention of African traditions is especially strong there. In 1898, Matanzas became the location of the first action in the [[Spanish–American War]]. The city was bombarded by American Navy vessels on 25 April 1898, just after the beginning of the war.

===Name origin===
The name Matanzas means "[[Wiktionary:massacre|massacre]]" and refers to a putative slaughter in 1510 at the port of the same name, in which 30 Spanish soldiers tried to cross one of the rivers to attack an aboriginal camp on the far shore. The Spanish soldiers had no boats, so they enlisted the help of native [[fishermen]]. However, once they reached the middle of the river, the fishermen flipped the boats, and due to the Spanish soldiers' heavy metal armor, most of them drowned.<ref>[http://parnaseo.uv.es/Editorial/Maura/CuartaParte.pdf Matanzas legend] (PDF)</ref> Only two women—one said to be the beautiful María de Estrada—survived, the result of being taken by a [[Cacique]]. De Estrada is said to have later escaped the "power of the Cacique" and married Pedro Sánchez Farfán in the city of [[Trinidad, Cuba|Trinidad]].  According to municipal historian Arnaldo Jimenez de la Cal, "[i]t was the first act of rebellion of natives in Cuba."

==Geography==
[[File:Sauto Theater in the Matanzas City.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sauto Theater]]]]
The city is located on the north shore of the island of Cuba, on all three sides of the Bay of Matanzas. The bay cuts deep in the island, and three rivers flow in the bay inside city limits (Rio Yumuri, San Juan, and Canimar). To the south-east, the landscape rises into a hill called ''Pan de Matanzas'', divided from the Atlantic coast by the Yumuri Valley and a coastal ridge.

The city of Matanzas is divided into four neighborhoods: Versalles, Matanzas, Playa and [[Pueblo Nuevo, Matanzas|Pueblo Nuevo]]. The municipality is divided into the [[barrio]]s of Bachicha, Bailén, Barracones, Bellamar, Camarioca, Cárcel, Ceiba Mocha, Colón, Corral Nuevo, Guanábana, Ojo de Agua, Refugio, San Luis, San Severino, Simpson y Monserrate, Versalles and Yumurí.<ref name=guije>{{Cite web|url=http://www.guije.com/pueblo/municipios/matanzas/index.htm|title=Matanzas|author=Guije.com|access-date=2007-10-07|language=es}}</ref>

===Buses===
Matanzas is also served by Viazul and Astro buses.

===Tramway===
After two failed attempts Matanzas had a tramway in 1916 (initially as '''Ferrocarril Eléctrico de Matanzas''', then as city owned ''' Compañía de Servicios Públicos de Matanzas''' in 1918 and '''Compañía de Tranvías de Matanzas''' in 1926).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tramz.com/cu/mt/mt.html|title = The Tramways of Cuba}}</ref> In 1952 it acquired tramcars from [[Havana#Tramway|Havana Electric Railway]], but converted with buses by new owners '''Omnibus Urbanos SA''' in 1954.

===Roads===
The [[Via Blanca (Cuba)|Via Blanca]] highway connects the city with both Havana in the west and [[Varadero]] in the east.
