'''Seongnam''' ({{Korean|hangul=성남}}; {{IPA|ko|sʰʌŋ.nam}}) is the fourth largest [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|city]] in South Korea's [[Gyeonggi Province]] after [[Suwon]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.suwon.go.kr/index.do|title=Suwon City|access-date=2018-06-14|archive-date=2018-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614094904/http://www.suwon.go.kr/index.do|url-status=live}}</ref> and the 10th largest city in the country. Its population is approximately one million. It consists of three administrative districts: [[Bundang District]], [[Jungwon District]], and [[Sujeong District]].

Seongnam, one of the foremost planned cities in [[History of South Korea|South Korean history]], was conceived during the era of President [[Park Chung Hee]] for the purpose of industrializing the nation by concentrating electronic, textile, and petrochemical facilities there during the 1970s and 1980s. The city featured a network of roads, to Seoul and other major cities like [[Gwangju, Gyeonggi]], from the early 1970s on. Today, Seongnam has merged with the metropolitan network of Seoul. Seongnam has also served as a ′test bed′ of South Korea's urban planning history. [[Bundang]], one of the successful new town projects in the country, has been settled in a southern half of Seongnam since 1991.

The city is also home to [[K League]] football club [[Seongnam FC]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.seongnamfc.com/index.php|script-title=ko:성남시민프로축구단|access-date=2018-06-14|archive-date=2016-09-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160929004947/http://www.seongnamfc.com/index.php|url-status=live}}</ref>
