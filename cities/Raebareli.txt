==History, etymology and post-independence==
Raebareli is supposedly a city founded by [[Bhar]]s, and originally called Bharauli or Barauli.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> The prefix "Rae" (pronounced Rai) originates from the title "Rai," historically borne by the Kayasth rulers of the region. Among the Srivastava community, specifically, a certain lineage is distinctively referred to as "Athhaisa (अट्ठाईसा)," highlighting a unique cultural or familial heritage associated with the Srivastava lineage. This lineage, known for its special bloodline, signifies both royal heritage and leadership within the region, marking the 'Athhaisa (अट्ठाईसा)' Srivastavas as distinguished historical rulers.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> Later the city was conquered by [[Ibrahim Shah of Jaunpur|Ibrahim Shah]] of the [[Jaunpur Sultanate]] and then handed over to [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Sheikhs]] and [[Sayyid]]s.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> The city's fort was built by Ibrahim Shah in 820 [[Hijri year|AH]], most likely using materials from earlier structures.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> Apart from the gate on the west side, it is mostly in ruins; it consists of an outer layer of brick surrounding an earthwork core.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> Outside the gate is the shrine of the Muslim saint Makhdum Saiyid Jafri.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> According to legend, during the fort's original construction, everything built during the day kept collapsing at night; the sultan then summoned the saint from Jaunpur, and then as soon as he walked on the site the construction proceeded without difficulty.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> Ibrahim Shah also had at least two mosques built in Raebareli.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> One was the [[Jama Masjid]], which was restored in 1089 AH by [[Aurangzeb]] and still stands today.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> The other no longer exists; in the late 19th century a [[dispensary]] was built on the site by [[Raja Drigjibai Singh]] of [[Murarmau]].<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> Rae Bareli was also spelled as "Raibareilly" which is actively being used in various places including central government managed websites such as Vahan Citizen Services. <ref>https://vahan.parivahan.gov.in/ {{Bare URL inline|date=August 2024}}</ref> 

Since the time of Ibrahim Shah, Raebareli has continuously been an important regional town.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> His grandson [[Husain Shah (Jaunpur Sultanate)|Husain Shah]] renamed the city ''Husainabad'' after himself, but the name change never caught on.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> Different [[mahalla]]s were founded by descendants of the original Muslim settlers in the city: Qasbana, Neza Andaz, Saiyid Rajan, Bans Tola, and Pirai Hamid were founded by Muslims; Jaunpuri, Khali Sahat, and Surjipur were founded by [[Brahmin]]s; Khatrauni Kalan and Khurd by the Khattri treasurers of the Jaunpur sultans, and Shah Tola by the royal purveyor.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/>

Raja Har Parshad "Taluqedar of Naseerabad" a, native of this town, was the [[Nazim]] or Commissioner of Khairabad Division during the reign of the ex-king. He joined the mutineers and went up to [[Nepal]] with [[Begum Hazrat Mahal]] of [[Oudh State|Oudh]] dynasty and on 31 December 1858 while returning after ensuring her safety, he was killed in a battle with [[British Raj|British]] army. He has been honoured with the title of "''Lastville and the most notorious governor of Oudh''". The district of [[Raebareli district|Raebareli]] was created by the British in 1858, and is named after its headquarters town.<ref>according to an article in Saptahik Ganga Yamuna weekly newspaper dated 22 to 28 January 1995</ref> [[Rana Beni Madho|Rana Beni Madhav Baksh Singh]] is well known freedom fighter of this district.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.jagran.com/lite/uttar-pradesh/raebareli-freedom-fighter-rana-beni-madhav-baksh-jayanti-celebrated-with-panoply-18340227.html|title=धूमधाम से मनायी जायेगी स्वतंत्रता संग्राम सेनानी राणा बेनी माधव बख्श की जयंती}}</ref> Munshiganj retaliation of common people for freedom shows an example for the rest of Oudh.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://raebareli.nic.in/history/|title=History &#124; District Raebareli, Government of Uttar Pradesh &#124; India}}</ref>

After the uprising, Raebareli was chosen as the site of the new district headquarters.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> A [[cantonment]] was established to the southwest of the city, but it was only in use for a few years before being abandoned.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> Raebareli was first constituted as a municipality in 1867, with originally 23 members on the municipal board, later reduced to 16.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/>

At the turn of the 20th century, Raebareli was described as an important commercial centre for the surrounding region, especially since the coming of the railway.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> It then consisted of two separate sites: Raebareli proper and Jahanabad.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> Originally founded by the [[subahdar]] Jahan Khan, it contained the Rang Mahal palace and the [[maqbara]] or mausoleum of Jahan Khan.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> The city had six marketplaces: Purana Bazar (also called Qila Darwaza), Jahanabad, Capperganj, Baillieganj, Graceyganj, and Whishganj.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> A seventh one, known as Munshiganj, also existed a short distance away from the city on the road to [[Dalmau]].<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> It had been founded by Diwan Chand Sahai, who along with his brother Munshi Gur Sahai had served as assistants of [[Nawab Ali Naqi Khan]].<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> Capperganj, near Jahanabad, had been established by Ganga Sahai and served as a marketplace for a wide variety of goods, including [[brass]]work from [[Hasanpur Bandhua]], cloth from [[Jais]], and vegetables from [[Lucknow]] as well as imported European goods.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> Baillieganj, founded by the British official D.C. Baillie, served as "the main [[wholesale]] market in the district" at the time.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> It was distinct in that it did not levy an [[octroi]] fee on  goods brought there, "so that it serves the purposed of a [[bonded warehouse]]".<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> During the [[Indian famine of 1899-1900]], the increased demand for food in the [[Bombay Presidency]] triggered a surge in the [[grain trade]] at Baillieganj.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/>

Four prominent [[mosque]]s were noted at this point.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> The first of these was the Jami Masjid, which as mentioned dated back to the reign of Ibrahim Shah.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> The second was built in 1040 AH by Nawab Jahan Khan, who founded Jahanabad.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> The third, built by [[Shah Alam-ullah]], was modelled after the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]] and was domeless but had three main halls.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> The last of the four was built by Shah Alam-ullah's son in the suburb of Daira.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/>

Other landmarks at the time included the dispensary and [[caravanserai|sarai]] built by Drigjibai Singh after the British annexation of [[Oudh State]] in the 1850s.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> Built around the same time was a large masonry bridge across the Sai, commissioned by the British deputy commissionner W. Glynn and partly financed by some [[Bais (Rajput clan)|Bais Rajput]] [[taluqdar]]s.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> The city also had several schools, including a government-run high school, a branch school located within the fort, a vernacular middle school run by the municipality, and five indigenous schools supported by [[grants-in-aid]].<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> Two of these were in the fort, two more were in Jahanabad, and the last one was at Wazirganj.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> There was also a [[Sanskrit]] [[Pathshala]].<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/>

According to the [[1901 Census of India|1901 census]], the population of Raebareli was 15,880 people (8,321 male and 7,559 female).<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> This included 8,825 Hindus, 6,955 Muslims, 43 Sikhs, 38 Christians, and 19 Jains.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/> Among the notable Sikh residents were Shahzada Basdeo Singh, the great-grandson of Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] of the [[Sikh Empire]], as well as the descendants of [[Chhattar Singh]], one of the generals in the Sikh army.<ref name="Gazetteer 1905"/>
