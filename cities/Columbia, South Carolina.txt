It lies at the confluence of the [[Saluda River]] and the [[Broad River (Carolinas)|Broad River]], which merge at Columbia to form the [[Congaree River]]. As the state capital, Columbia is the site of the [[South Carolina State House]], the center of government for the state. In 1860, the South Carolina Secession Convention took place in Columbia; delegates voted for secession, making South Carolina the first state to leave the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in the events leading up to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

Columbia is home to the [[University of South Carolina]], the state's flagship public university and the largest in the state. The area has benefited from Congressional support for Southern military installations. Columbia is the site of [[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Fort Jackson]], the largest [[United States Army]] installation for [[United States Army Basic Training|Basic Combat Training]]. Twenty miles to the east of the city is [[McEntire Joint National Guard Base]], which is operated by the [[U.S. Air Force]] and is used as a training base for the [[169th Fighter Wing]] of the [[South Carolina Air National Guard]].

===Early history===
[[File:Slave quarters at the Hale–Elmore–Seibels House.jpg|thumb|left|Former slave quarters at the [[Hale–Elmore–Seibels House]] in downtown Columbia.]]
In May 1540, a Spanish expedition led by [[Hernando de Soto]] traversed what is now Columbia while moving northward on exploration of the interior of the Southeast. The expedition produced the earliest written historical records of this area, which was part of the regional [[Cofitachequi]] [[chiefdom]] of the [[Mississippian culture]].<ref name="Hudson1998">{{cite book|author=Charles Hudson|title=Knights of Spain, Warriors of the Sun: Hernando de Soto and the South's Ancient Chiefdoms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWJnGjxjJk8C|access-date=February 16, 2012|date=September 1998|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-2062-5|pages=234–238|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009061906/http://books.google.com/books?id=vWJnGjxjJk8C|archive-date=October 9, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

During the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial era]], European settlers encountered the Congaree in this area, who inhabited several villages along the Congaree River. The settlers established a frontier fort and fur trading post named after the Congaree, on the west bank of the Congaree River. It was at the fall line and the head of navigation in the [[Santee River]] system.

In 1754 the [[Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies|colonial government]] in [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]] established a ferry to connect the fort with the growing European settlements on the higher ground on the east bank.<ref name="columbiahistory">[http://www.columbiasc.net/about-columbia "A Brief History of Columbia."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219184430/http://www.columbiasc.net/about-columbia |date=February 19, 2015 }} City of Columbia Official Web Site. columbiasc.net. Retrieved February 20, 2015.</ref>

Like many other significant early settlements in colonial America, Columbia is on the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]] of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region. The [[fall line]] is often marked by rapids at the places where the river cuts sharply down to lower levels in the Tidewater or Low Country of the coastal plain. Beyond the fall line, the river is unnavigable for boats sailing upstream. Entrepreneurs and later industrialists established mills in such areas, as the water flowing downriver, often over falls, provided power to run equipment.

===Designation as state capital===
After the [[American Revolutionary War]] and United States independence, State Senator [[John Lewis Gervais]] of the town of [[Ninety Six, South Carolina|Ninety Six]] introduced a bill that was approved by the legislature on March 22, 1786, to create a new state capital. Considerable argument occurred over the name for the new city. According to published accounts, Senator Gervais said he hoped that "in this town we should find refuge under the wings of [[Columbia (name)|COLUMBIA]]", for that was the name which he wished it to be called. One legislator insisted on the name "Washington", but "Columbia" won by a vote of 11–7 in the state senate.

[[File:Monument marking original SC State House, Columbia IMG 4777.JPG|thumb|left|Monument marking site of original South Carolina State House, designed and built from 1786 to 1790 by [[James Hoban]]. It burned at the end of the Civil War in 1865.]]
The site was chosen as the new state capital in 1786 due to its central location in the state. The State Legislature first met there in 1790. After remaining under the direct government of the legislature for the first two decades of its existence, Columbia was incorporated as a village in 1805 and then as a city in 1854.

Columbia received a large stimulus to development when it was connected in a direct water route to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] by the [[Santee Canal]]. This connected the Santee and Cooper rivers in a {{convert|22|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} section. It was first chartered in 1786 and completed in 1800, making it one of the earliest canals in the United States. With competition later from faster railroad traffic, it ceased operation around 1850.

The commissioners designed a town of 400 blocks in a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on|0}} square along the river. The blocks were divided into lots of {{convert|0.5|acre|m2}} and sold to speculators and prospective residents. Buyers had to build a house at least {{convert|30|ft|m}} long and {{convert|18|ft|m}} wide within three years, or face an annual 5% penalty. The perimeter streets and two through streets were {{convert|150|ft|m}} wide. The remaining squares were divided by thoroughfares {{convert|100|ft|m}} wide. As the capital and one of the first [[planned community|planned cities]] in the United States, Columbia began to grow rapidly. Its population was nearing 1,000 shortly after the start of the 19th century.

[[File:South_Carolina_Governor%27s_Mansion,_800_Richland_St.,_columbia_(Richland_County,_South_Carolina).JPG|thumb|right|[[South Carolina Governor's Mansion]], built 1855]]

The commissioners constituted the local government until 1797, when a Commission of Streets and Markets was created by the General Assembly. Three main issues occupied most of their time: public drunkenness, gambling, and poor sanitation.

In 1801, South Carolina College (now the [[University of South Carolina]]) was founded in Columbia. The original building survives. The city was chosen as the site of the state college in an effort to unite residents of the [[Upstate South Carolina|Upcountry]] and the [[South Carolina Lowcountry|Lowcountry]] after the American Revolutionary War.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Timeline |url=https://www.sc.edu/about/our_history/university_history/timeline/index.php |access-date=August 23, 2023 |website=www.sc.edu}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Lesesne |first=Henry H. |date=August 15, 2022 |orig-date=June 28, 2016 |title=University of South Carolina |url=https://www.scencyclopedia.org/sce/entries/university-of-south-carolina/ |access-date=August 23, 2023 |website=South Carolina Encyclopedia |language=en-US}}</ref> The leaders of South Carolina kept a close eye on the new college: for many years after its founding, commencement exercises were held in December while the state legislature was in session.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lucas |first=Marion Brunson |title=Sherman and the burning of Columbia |date=1976 |publisher=Texas A & M University Press |isbn=0-89096-018-6 |edition=1st |location=College Station |oclc=2331311}}</ref>

Columbia received its first charter as a town in 1805. An intendant and six wardens governed the town. [[John Taylor (South Carolina governor)|John Taylor]], the first elected intendant, later served in both houses of the General Assembly, both houses of Congress, and eventually was elected as governor. By 1816, some 250 homes had been built in the town and a population was more than 1000.

In 1828, the [[Elias Marks#South Carolina Female Collegiate Institute at Barhamville|South Carolina Female ''Collegiate'' Institute]] was founded by [[Elias Marks]] for the higher education of young women.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scencyclopedia.org/sce/entries/barhamville-academy/ |title=Barhamville Academy|last=Gergel |first=Belinda F. |date=14 September 2016 |website=South Carolina Encyclopedia |publisher=Univ. of S.C. |access-date=20 October 2022}}</ref> (The word ''Collegiate'' was added to its charter in 1835.) Since the school was located on 500 acres in the Barhamville area of Columbia, it was often informally called Barhamville Institute or Barhamville Academy. "...it was the first and only school of its character at the South. It was of a very high class..."<ref>{{cite book |last=Sims |first=James Marion |author-link=J. Marion Sims |date=1884 |title=The Story of my life |location=New York |publisher=D. Appleton |page=102}}</ref> The Barhamville Institute closed in 1867 due to the economic dislocation of the Civil War.

Columbia became chartered as a city in 1854, with an elected mayor and six aldermen. Two years later, Columbia had a police force consisting of a full-time chief and nine patrolmen. The city continued to grow at a rapid pace, and throughout the 1850s and 1860s, Columbia was the largest inland city in the Carolinas. Railroad transportation served as a significant cause of population expansion in Columbia during this time. Rail lines that reached the city in the 1840s primarily transported cotton bales, not passengers, from there to major markets and the port of Charlestown. Cotton was the chief commodity of the state and lifeblood of the Columbia community; in 1850, virtually all of the city's commercial and economic activity was related to cotton. Cotton was sent to New York and New England's textile mills, as well as to England and Europe, where demand was high.

"In 1830, around 1,500 [[slavery in the United States|slaves]] lived and worked in Columbia; this population grew to 3,300 by 1860. Some members of this large enslaved population worked in their masters' households. Masters also frequently hired out slaves to Columbia residents and institutions, including South Carolina College. Hired-out slaves sometimes returned to their owners' homes daily; others boarded with their temporary masters."<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|url=http://slaveryatusc.weebly.com/urban-slavery-in-columbia.html|title=Urban Slavery in Columbia|work=Slavery at South Carolina College, 1801–1865:<br />The Foundations of the University of South Carolina|access-date=September 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722215524/http://slaveryatusc.weebly.com/urban-slavery-in-columbia.html|archive-date=July 22, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Civil War====
{{Main|Capture of Columbia|Columbia, South Carolina, in the American Civil War}}
Columbia was of considerable importance to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Columbia was the site of the first Southern secession convention, which assembled in the [[First Baptist Church (Columbia, South Carolina)|First Baptist Church]] on December 17, 1860. Secession may have been declared in Columbia, were it not for a smallpox outbreak that moved the convention to Charleston, where South Carolina became the first state to secede from the Union on December 20.{{Sfn|Lucas|1976|p=23}} A considerable military infrastructure sprung up in Columbia. The state arsenal was located in Columbia, along with the state military academy. The University of South Carolina grounds were converted into a military hospital since its role as an educational institution had been made moot after its entire student body volunteered for the Confederate Army.{{Sfn|Lucas|1976|p=24}} Numerous industrial facilities produced war materiel. By 1865, it was also the Confederacy's last breadbasket. All of these factors combined to make it the obvious next target for General [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T. Sherman]] after his successful [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]] captured [[Savannah, Georgia]]. {{Sfn|Lucas|1976|p=30}}

The Union Army, under Gen. Sherman, captured the city on February 17, 1865.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sherman |first1=William Tecumseh |title=Burning of Columbia, South Carolina |date=2009 |publisher=Great Neck Publishing |page=384}}</ref> Much of the city was destroyed by fire between the 17th and 18th. The idea that General Sherman ordered the burning of Columbia has persisted as part of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy]] narrative. However modern historians have concluded that no one cause led to the burning of Columbia and that Sherman did not order the burning. Rather, the chaotic atmosphere in the city on the occasion of its fall led to the ideal conditions for a fire to start and spread. As a newspaper columnist noted in 1874, "the war burned Columbia."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lucas |first=Marion Brunson |title=Sherman and the burning of Columbia |date=2021 |isbn=978-1-64336-246-5 |edition=2nd |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |location=Columbia, South Carolina |pages=11–13 |oclc=1261302122}}</ref>

====Reconstruction era and beyond====
During the Reconstruction era, when African-American Republicans were among the legislators elected to state government, Columbia became the focus of considerable attention. Reporters, journalists, travelers, and tourists flocked here to see a Southern state legislature whose members included freedmen (former slaves), as well as [[people of color|men of color]] who had been free before the war. The city began to rebuild and recover from the devastating fire of 1865; a mild construction boom took place within the first few years of Reconstruction. In addition, repair of railroad tracks in outlying areas created more jobs for residents.

By the late nineteenth century, culture was expanding in the city. In 1897 the Columbia Music Festival Association (CMFA) was founded<ref>{{cite web|title=Mission|url=http://www.cmfaonline.com/OurAssociation/Mission.aspx|publisher=Columbia Music Festival Association|access-date=August 23, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924020540/http://www.cmfaonline.com/OurAssociation/Mission.aspx|archive-date=September 24, 2012}}</ref> by Mayor William McB. Sloan and the city aldermen. It was headquartered in the Opera House on Main Street, which also served as City Hall. Its role was to book and manage concerts and events in the opera house for the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Columbia Music Festival Association |url=https://cmfaonline.com/ |access-date=2022-11-06 |website=cmfaonline.com}}</ref>

During the early 20th century, Columbia developed as a regional textile manufacturing center. In 1907, Columbia had six mills in operation: [[Richland Cotton Mill|Richland]], [[Granby Mill Village Historic District|Granby]], [[Olympia Mill|Olympia]], Capital City, Columbia, and Palmetto. Combined, they employed over 3,400 workers with an annual payroll of $819,000, giving the Midlands an economic boost of over $4.8 million. Columbia had no paved streets until 1908, when 17 blocks of Main Street were surfaced. But, it had 115 publicly maintained street crossings, boardwalks placed at intersections to keep pedestrians from having to wade through a sea of mud between wooden sidewalks. As an experiment, Washington Street was once paved with wooden blocks. This proved to be the source of much local amusement when they buckled and floated away during heavy rains. The blocks were replaced with asphalt paving in 1925.

During the years 1911 and 1912, some $2.5 million worth of construction occurred in the city, as investors used revenues generated by the mills. New projects included construction of the Union Bank Building at Main and Gervais, the [[Palmetto Building|Palmetto National Bank]], a shopping arcade, and large hotels at Main and Laurel (the Jefferson) and at Main and Wheat (the Gresham). In 1917, the city was selected by the US Army to be developed as the site of [[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Camp Jackson]], a U.S. military installation that was officially classified as a "Field Artillery Replacement Depot". The first recruits arrived at the camp on September 1, 1917. In the first several decades of the 20th century, white Democrats of the [[Solid South]] controlled an outsize amount of power in the House and Senate. The former Confederate states had effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] most blacks and many poor whites through passage of discriminatory laws and constitutions that made voter registration and voting more difficult. But they controlled all the seats in Congress related to the total state populations.

In 1930, Columbia was the hub of a trading area with about 500,000 potential customers. It had 803 retail establishments, 280 of them being food stores. The city also had 58 clothing and apparel outlets, 57 restaurants and lunch rooms, 55 filling stations, 38 pharmacies, 20 furniture stores, 19 auto dealers, 11 shoe stores, nine cigar stands, five department stores, and one book store. Wholesale distributors located within the city numbered 119, with one-third of them dealing in food.

In 1934, the federal courthouse at the corner of Main and Laurel streets was purchased by the city for use as City Hall. Built of granite from nearby [[Winnsboro, South Carolina|Winnsboro]], [[Columbia City Hall (South Carolina)|Columbia City Hall]] is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Designed by [[Alfred B. Mullett|Alfred Built Mullett]], President [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s federal architect, the building was completed in 1876. Mullet, best known for his design of the [[Eisenhower Executive Office Building|Executive Office Building]] in Washington, DC, had originally designed the courthouse with a clock tower. It was not constructed, perhaps because of large cost overruns on the project. Copies of Millet's original drawings can be seen on the walls of City Hall alongside historic photos of other Columbia beginnings. Federal offices were moved to the new [[J. Bratton Davis United States Bankruptcy Courthouse]].

In 1940 Camp Jackson was reactivated after war started in Europe, and was designated as Fort Jackson. City leaders and the congressional delegation had lobbied to gain such a permanent military installation. In the early 1940s, shortly after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor|attack on Pearl Harbor]], which catalyzed the entry of the US into [[World War II]], Lt. Colonel [[Jimmy Doolittle]] and his group of now-famous pilots began training for the 1942 [[Doolittle Raid]] over Tokyo at what is now [[Columbia Metropolitan Airport]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Columbia Metropolitan Airport – Columbia, SC – Columbia's airport |url=http://www.columbiasouthcarolina.com/airport.html |access-date=September 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322175251/http://www.columbiasouthcarolina.com/airport.html|archive-date=March 22, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> They trained in [[B-25 Mitchell]] bombers, the same model as the plane that is installed at Columbia's [[Owens Field]] in the [[Curtiss-Wright]] hangar.

During the 1940s African Americans increased activism for their civil rights: seeking to reverse [[Jim Crow laws]] and [[racism|racial discrimination]] that pushed them into second-class status in Columbia and the state. In 1945, a federal judge ruled that the city's black teachers were entitled to equal pay to that of their white counterparts. But, in following years, the state attempted to strip many blacks of their teaching credentials. Other issues in which the blacks of the city sought equality concerned [[suffrage|voting rights]] and [[racial segregation|segregation]] (particularly regarding public schools). In 1954, in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', the US Supreme Court ruled that segregated public schools were unconstitutional.

On August 21, 1962, eight downtown chain stores served blacks at their lunch counters for the first time. The University of South Carolina, a public institution, admitted its first black students in 1963. Around that same time, many vestiges of segregation began to disappear from the city: blacks attained membership on various municipal boards and commissions, and the city adopted a non-discriminatory hiring policy. These and other such signs of racial progress helped earn the city the 1964 [[All-America City Award]] for the second time (the first being in 1951). A 1965 article in ''[[Newsweek]]'' lauded Columbia as a city that had "liberated itself from the plague of doctrinal [[apartheid]]".<ref>''Newsweek'', May 3, 1965; cited in {{cite book |last1=Moore |first1=John Hammond |title=Columbia and Richland County: A South Carolina Community, 1740-1990 |date=1993 |publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press |isbn=978-0-87249-827-3 |page=426 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2GnH6cXpukwC&pg=PA426 |language=en}}</ref>

Since the late 20th century, historic preservation has played a significant part in the city. The historic [[Robert Mills House]] was restored in 1967, which inspired the renovation and restoration of other historic structures, such as the [[Hampton-Preston House]] and others associated with President [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Maxcy Gregg]], [[Mary Boykin Chesnut]], and noted free black Celia Mann. In the early 1970s, the University of South Carolina initiated the refurbishment of its "Horseshoe". Several area museums also benefited from the increased historical interest of that time, among them the Fort Jackson Museum, the McKissick Museum on the campus of the University of South Carolina, and most notably the [[South Carolina State Museum]], which opened in 1988.

Mayor [[Kirkman Finlay Jr.]], was the driving force behind the refurbishment of Seaboard Park, now known as [[Finlay Park]], in the historic Congaree Vista district. His administration developed the $60 million Palmetto Center package, which resulted in construction of an office tower, parking garage, and the Columbia Marriott hotel, which opened in 1983. In 1980, the Columbia metropolitan population reached 410,088, and in 1990, this figure had hit roughly 470,000. During the 1970s and 1980s skyscrapers were constructed and other real-estate development took place throughout Columbia. To meet demand of businesses, the city constructed The [[Tower at 1301 Gervais]] in 1973. In 1983, Hub at Columbia was constructed. In 1987, the [[Capitol Center (Columbia, South Carolina)|Capitol Center]] was built, which became the tallest building in South Carolina. The [[Bank of America]] Plaza was built in 1989.

During the 1990s and early 2000s the city worked to revitalize the downtown, as businesses had been pulled out to the suburbs. The [[Congaree Vista]] district along Gervais Street, once known as a warehouse district, became an area of art galleries, shops, and restaurants. The [[Colonial Life Arena]] (formerly known as the Colonial Center) opened in 2002, and brought several major entertainers and shows to Columbia. [[EdVenture]], the largest children's museum in the Southeast, opened in 2003. The [[Village at Sandhill]] shopping center opened in 2004 in northeast Richland County.

The Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center opened in 2004, and a new convention center hotel opened in September 2007. A public-private City Center Partnership has been formed to implement the downtown revitalization and boost downtown growth. In 2009, Columbia's most recent skyscraper, the Tower at Main and Gervais, was completed. Mayor [[Stephen K. Benjamin]] started his first term in July 2010, elected as the first African-American mayor in the city's history.

[[Founders Park]], home of USC baseball, opened in 2009. The South Carolina Gamecocks baseball team won two NCAA national championships in 2010 and in 2011. The [[2010 South Carolina Gamecocks football team]], under coach [[Steve Spurrier]], earned their first appearance in the SEC championship. Historic flooding in the city in October 2015 forced the Gamecocks football team to move their October 10 home game. [[Segra Park]] (formerly Spirit Communications Park), home of the [[Columbia Fireflies]], opened in April 2016. In April 2017, the Gamecocks women's basketball team (under coach [[Dawn Staley]]) won their first NCAA championship, and the men's basketball team went to the Final Four for the first time. They won their second national championship in 2022 and third in 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ignudo |first=Tom |date=April 7, 2024 |title=Philadelphia native Dawn Staley wins 3rd national championship at South Carolina in victory over Iowa |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/south-carolina-vs-iowa-dawn-staley-national-championship-womens-basketball/ |access-date=April 8, 2024 |website=CBS News Philadelphia |language=en-US}}</ref>

A [[Mast General Store]] was opened in 2011. The [[Music Farm (music venue)|Music Farm]] (now called The Senate) opened a location in Columbia on Senate Street in 2014. In 2000, the Confederate battle flag was moved from the South Carolina State House to the Confederate monument. On July 10, 2015, the flag was removed from the monument to a museum in the wake of the [[Charleston church shooting]] a month before by Columbia-born resident [[Dylann Roof]]. In August 2017, the central path of a [[Solar eclipse of August 21, 2017|total solar eclipse]] passed directly over the city and state capitol.

In March 2019, the [[murder of Samantha Josephson]] gained national attention. In [[Five Points (Columbia, South Carolina)|Five Points]], a neighborhood in Columbia known for its late-night bars, Samantha Josephson mistakenly entered into a car she believed was her [[Uber]]. The driver, Nathaniel Rowland, killed Josephson, sparking laws around the United States to further regulate rideshare companies. In South Carolina, the Samantha L. Josephson Ridesharing Act requires rideshare drivers to display identifying lights and prohibits the misrepresentation of non-rideshare drivers as such.<ref>{{Cite web |title=2019-2020 Bill 4380: Samantha L.

==Geography==
[[File:South Carolina.jpg|thumb|right|Photograph of Columbia taken from the [[International Space Station]]]]
[[File:Gervais_Street_Bridge,_Gervais_Street_spanning_Congaree_River,_Columbia_(Richland_County,_South_Carolina).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Gervais Street Bridge]] over the Congaree River]]
One of Columbia's more prominent geographical features is the fall line, the boundary between the upland [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont region]] and the [[Atlantic Coastal Plain]], across which rivers drop as falls or rapids. Columbia developed at the fall line of the Congaree River, which is formed by the confluence of the Broad and Saluda rivers. The Congaree was the farthest inland point of river navigation. The energy of falling water also powered Columbia's early [[Cotton mill|mills]].

The city has capitalized on this location, which includes three rivers, by identifying as "The Columbia Riverbanks Region". Columbia is located roughly halfway between the Atlantic Ocean and the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], at an elevation around {{convert|292|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020527061848/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|archive-date=May 27, 2002|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Soils in Columbia are well drained in most cases, with grayish brown loamy sand topsoil. The subsoil may be yellowish-red, sandy clay loam (Orangeburg series), yellowish-brown sandy clay loam (Norfolk series), or strong brown sandy clay (Marlboro series). All belong to the [[Ultisol]] soil order.<ref>[http://soils.usda.gov/survey/online_surveys/south_carolina/richland/maps/gsm.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224224546/http://soils.usda.gov/survey/online_surveys/south_carolina/richland/maps/gsm.pdf|date=February 24, 2013}}</ref><ref>[https://soilseries.sc.egov.usda.gov/OSD_Docs/O/ORANGEBURG.html Official Series Description - Orangeburg Series] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718230743/https://soilseries.sc.egov.usda.gov/OSD_Docs/O/ORANGEBURG.html |date=July 18, 2011}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|140.68|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|137.81|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|2.87|sqmi}} (1.68%) is water.<ref name="TigerWebMapServer"/> Approximately ⅔ of Columbia's land area, {{convert|81.2|sqmi|km2}}, is contained within the Fort Jackson Military Installation, much of which consists of uninhabited training grounds. The actual inhabited area for the city is slightly more than {{convert|50|sqmi|km2}}.<ref name="2020CensusQuickFacts"/>

=== Climate ===
Columbia has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), with relatively cool to mild winters and hot and humid summers. The area averages 55 nights below freezing and is subject to temporary [[Cold wave|cold spells]] during the winter, but extended cold or days where the temperature fails to rise above freezing are both rare.<ref name = "NWS Columbia, SC (CAE)"/> These cold snaps usually result from atmospheric [[Trough (meteorology)|troughs]] that bring in cold air from Canada across the Eastern part of the country. The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] places Columbia in the 8a [[Hardiness zone|Hardiness Zone]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/planting-zones/south-carolina-planting-zones.htm|title=South Carolina Planting Zones – USDA Map Of South Carolina Growing Zones|website=Gardening Know How|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528221741/https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/planting-zones/south-carolina-planting-zones.htm|archive-date=May 28, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>

With an annual average of 5 days with {{convert|100|°F|0}}+ and 72 days with {{convert|90|°F|0}}+ temperatures,<ref name="NWS Columbia, SC (CAE)" /> the city's current promotional slogan describes Columbia as "Famously Hot".<ref>{{cite web|title=Columbia SC Official Website |url=http://www.columbiacvb.com|access-date=March 9, 2013 |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013174629/http://www.columbiacvb.com/|archive-date=October 13, 2010}}</ref> In the summer months, Columbia usually has the greatest high temperature in the state.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://sercc.com/climateinfo/historical/mean90.html |title=Number of Days with Max Temperatures Equal to or Above 90°F for Selected Cities in the Southeast |website=Southeast Regional Climate Center|access-date=2019-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528221749/http://sercc.com/climateinfo/historical/mean90.html|archive-date=May 28, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> One reason for this is its low [[elevation]] in comparison to other cities at similar latitudes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Does Elevation Affect Temperature? |website=OnTheSnow |url=https://www.onthesnow.com/news/a/15157/does-elevation-affect-temperature |access-date=2019-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528221738/https://www.onthesnow.com/news/a/15157/does-elevation-affect-temperature|archive-date=May 28, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> For example, [[Atlanta]] has a significantly higher elevation, which helps to moderate its summer temperatures. Secondly, the city lies in the heart of the [[Sandhills (Carolina)|Sandhills]] region. Since the region's soils are more sandy, they contain less water and can warm up more quickly.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Soil temperature |url=https://horticulture.tekura.school.nz/soils/soils-2/ht1032-soils-2-study-plan/soil-temperature/ |website=Te Kura Horticulture |access-date=2019-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528221743/https://horticulture.tekura.school.nz/soils/soils-2/ht1032-soils-2-study-plan/soil-temperature/|archive-date=May 28, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> This explains why usually only the high temperatures and not the low temperatures are much different from across the state. Thirdly, because of its distance from the [[Atlantic Ocean]], it does not receive the same moderating effects of coastal cities like [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. Lastly, the city experiences the [[urban heat island]] effect, making it significantly warmer than some surrounding towns and cities.

Precipitation, at {{convert|44.6|in|mm|sigfig=3}} annually, peaks in the summer months largely because of afternoon thunderstorms, and is the least during spring and fall.<ref name="NWS Columbia, SC (CAE)" /> Snowfall averages {{convert|1.5|in|cm|1}}, but is largely variable depending on the year.<ref name="NWS Columbia, SC (CAE)" /> Snow flurries usually do fall at least once during the winter season during its coldest periods. Like much of the southeastern U.S., the city is prone to [[Temperature inversion|inversions]], which trap ozone and other pollutants over the area.

Official extremes in temperature at the main weather station have ranged from {{convert|109|°F|0}} on [[Summer 2012 North American heat wave|June 29 and 30, 2012]] down to {{convert|−2|°F|0}}, set on [[Great Blizzard of 1899|February 14, 1899]].

Private student housing and some residential projects are going up nearby; the CanalSide development<ref>{{cite web|title=CanalSide development|work=Canalside Lofts - Apartment Homes in Downtown Columbia, SC |url=http://www.CanalSideColumbia.com |access-date=September 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190828183412/https://canalsidecolumbia.com/|archive-date=August 28, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> at the site of the old Central Correctional Institution, is the most high-profile. Completed in 2018, CanalSide is a 23-acre mixed-use development in the Vista on the Congaree River and is home to 750 residential rental apartments: townhomes, condominiums and lofts. Lady Street between Huger and Assembly streets in the Vista and the [[Five Points (Columbia)|Five Points neighborhood]] have undergone beautification projects, which mainly consisted of replacing curbs and gutters, and adding brick-paved sidewalks and angled parking.

Special revitalization efforts are being aimed at Main Street, which began seeing an exodus of department and specialty stores in the 1990s. The goal is to re-establish Main Street as a vibrant commercial and residential corridor, and the stretch of Main Street home to most businesses—-from Gervais to Blanding streets—-has been streetscaped in recent years. Notable developments completed in recent years along Main Street include an 18-story, $60 million tower at the high-profile corner of Main and Gervais streets, the renovation of the 1441 Main Street office building as the new Midlands headquarters for [[Wells Fargo]] Bank (formerly [[Wachovia]] Bank), a new sanctuary for the Holy Trinity [[Greek Orthodox]] Church, the location of Mast General store in the historic [[Efird's Department Store|Efird's building]], and the relocation of the Nickelodeon theater. A façade improvement program for the downtown business district, implemented in 2011, has resulted in the restoration and improvement of the façades of several historic Main Street shopfronts. One of the most ambitious development projects in the city's history is currently underway which involves old state mental health campus downtown on Bull Street. Known formally as Columbia Common, this project will consist of rehabbing several historic buildings on the campus, as well as constructing new buildings, for residential, hospitality, and retail use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wistv.com/story/22672800/city-will-announce-plans-for-old-bull-street-hospital-campus|title=City officials announce plans for old Bull Street hospital - wistv.com - Columbia, South Carolina -|author=Jack Kuenzie|date=June 24, 2013|access-date=September 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525234318/http://www.wistv.com/story/22672800/city-will-announce-plans-for-old-bull-street-hospital-campus|archive-date=May 25, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> A minor league baseball stadium was built on the campus in 2016.

[[File:FinlayPark.jpg|thumb|[[Finlay Park]]]]
[[Finlay Park]] has hosted events from festivals and political rallies to road races and Easter Sunrise services. This {{convert|18|acre|m2|adj=on}} park has had two lives; first dedicated in 1859 as Sidney Park, named in honor of Algernon Sidney Johnson, a Columbia City Councilman, the park experienced an illustrious but short tenure. The park fell into disrepair after the Civil War and served as a site for commercial ventures until the late 20th century. In 1990, the park was reopened. It serves as the site for such events as Kids Day, The Summer Concert Series, plus many more activities. In 1992, the park was renamed Finlay Park, in honor of Kirkman Finlay, by former mayor of Columbia, [[T. Patton Adams]], who had a vision to reenergize the historic Congaree Vista district, between Main Street and the river, and recreate the site that was formerly known as Sidney Park. In 2023, the city broke ground on a $24 million redesign of the park which will include a rebuilt central fountain, a new band stage, public art, enhanced lawn areas, and new amenities such as strolling gardens and an overlook plaza.<ref>[https://columbiasc.gov/city-of-columbia-holds-groundbreaking-ceremony-for-finlay-park-revitalization/ City of Columbia Holds Groundbreaking Ceremony for Finlay Park Revitalization] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240327224839/https://columbiasc.gov/city-of-columbia-holds-groundbreaking-ceremony-for-finlay-park-revitalization/ |date=March 27, 2024 }}.

This park was created to serve as a memorial to those who served their country and presently has monuments honoring the [[USS Columbia]] warship and those that served with her during [[World War II]], the China-Burma-India Theater Veterans of WWII, casualties of the [[Pearl Harbor]] attack of December 7, 1941, who were from South Carolina, [[Holocaust survivors]] who live in South Carolina as well as concentration camp liberators from South Carolina, and the State [[Vietnam War]] Veterans. The park was dedicated in November 1986 along with the unveiling of the South Carolina Vietnam Monument. In June 2000, the [[Korean War]] Memorial was dedicated at Memorial Park. In November 2014, Columbia native and resident of Boston, Henry Crede, gave a bronze statue and plaza in the park dedicated to his WWII comrades who served in the Navy from South Carolina.

Granby Park opened in November 1998 as a gateway to the rivers of Columbia, adding another access to the many river activities available to residents. Granby is part of the Three Rivers Greenway, a system of green spaces along the banks of the rivers in Columbia, adding another piece to the long-range plan and eventually connecting to the existing Riverfront Park. Granby is a {{convert|24|acre|m2|adj=on}} linear park with canoe access points, fishing spots, bridges, and ½ mile of nature trail along the banks of the Congaree River.

In the Five Points district of downtown Columbia is the park dedicated to the legacy and memory of civil rights leader, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] Formerly known as Valley Park, it was renamed in the late 1980s. The park features a water sculpture and a community center. An integral element of the park is the Stone of Hope monument, unveiled in January 1996. The monument is inscribed with a portion of King's 1964 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] acceptance speech: "History is cluttered with the wreckage of nations and individuals that pursued that self-defeating path of hate. Love is the key to the solutions of the problems of the world."

One of Columbia's greatest assets is [[Riverbanks Zoo|Riverbanks Zoo & Garden]]. Riverbanks Zoo is a sanctuary for more than 2,000 animals housed in natural habitat exhibits along the Saluda River. Just across the river, the {{convert|70|acre|m2|adj=on}} botanical garden is devoted to gardens, woodlands, plant collections, and historic ruins.

Situated along the meandering Congaree River in central South Carolina, [[Congaree National Park]] is home to champion trees, primeval forest landscapes, and diverse plant and animal life. This {{convert|22200|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} park protects the largest contiguous tract of old-growth bottomland hardwood forest remaining in the United States. The park is an international [[biosphere reserve]]. Known for its giant hardwoods and towering pines, the park's floodplain forest includes one of the highest canopies in the world and some of the tallest trees in the eastern United States. Congaree National Park provides a sanctuary for plants and animals, a research site for scientists, and a place to walk and relax in a tranquil wilderness setting.

[[Sesquicentennial State Park]] is a {{convert|1419|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} park, featuring a {{convert|30|acre|m2|adj=on}} lake surrounded by trails and picnic areas. The park's proximity to downtown Columbia and three major interstate highways attracts both local residents and travelers. Sesquicentennial is often the site of family reunions and group campouts. Interpretive nature programs are a major attraction to the park. The park also contains a two-story log house, dating back to the mid 18th century, which was relocated to the park in 1969. This house is believed to be the oldest building still standing in Richland County. The park was originally built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Evidence of their craftsmanship is still present today.

In November 1996, the River Alliance proposed that a {{convert|12|mi|km|0|adj=on}} linear park system be created to link people to their rivers. This was named the Three Rivers Greenway, and the $18 million estimated cost was agreed to by member governments (the cities of [[Cayce, South Carolina|Cayce]], Columbia, and [[West Columbia, South Carolina|West Columbia]]) with the proviso that the Alliance recommend an acceptable funding strategy.

While the funding process was underway, an existing city of Columbia site located on the [[Congaree River]] offered an opportunity to be a pilot project for the Three Rivers Greenway. The Alliance was asked to design and permit for construction by a general contractor this component. This approximately one-half-mile segment of the system was opened in November 1998. It is complete with {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=on}} wide concrete pathways, vandal-proof lighting, trash receptacles, water fountains, picnic benches, overlooks, bank fishing access, canoe/kayak access, a public restroom and parking. These set the standards for the common elements in the rest of the system. Eventually, pathways will run from Granby to the Riverbanks Zoo. Boaters, sportspeople, and fisherpeople will have access to the area, and additional recreational uses are being planned along the miles of riverfront.

Running beside the historic [[Columbia Canal]], Riverfront Park hosts a two and a half-mile trail. Spanning the canal is an old railway bridge that now is a pedestrian walkway. The park is used for walking, running, bicycling, and fishing. [[Picnic table]]s and benches dot the walking trail. Markers are located along the trail so that visitors can measure distance. The park is part of the Palmetto Trail, a hiking and biking trail that stretches the entire length of the state, from [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]] to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]].

==Government==
[[File:Columbia, SC, City Hall IMG 4807.JPG|thumb|Columbia City Hall]]
The city of Columbia has a [[council-manager]] form of government. The mayor and [[city council]] are elected every four years, with no [[term limit]]s. Elections are held in the spring. Unlike other mayors in council-manager systems, the Columbia mayor has the power to veto [[local ordinance|ordinance]]s passed by the council; vetoes can be overridden by a two-thirds majority of the council, which appoints a [[city manager]] to serve as chief administrative officer. The current mayor is [[Daniel Rickenmann]], who succeeded [[Stephen K. Benjamin]] on January 4, 2022.

The city council consists of six members, four from districts and two elected [[at-large]]. The city council is responsible for making policies and enacting laws, rules, and regulations in order to provide for future community and economic growth, in addition to providing the necessary support for the orderly and efficient operation of city services.
