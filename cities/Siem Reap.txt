'''Siem Reap''' ({{lang-km|សៀមរាប}}, {{lang|km-Latn|Siĕm Réab}} {{IPA-km|siəm riəp|}}) is the [[List of cities and towns in Cambodia|second-largest city]] of [[Cambodia]], as well as the capital and largest city of [[Siem Reap Province]] in northwestern Cambodia.

'''Siem Reap''' has [[French Protectorate of Cambodia |French-colonial]] and Chinese-style architecture in the Old French Quarter and around the Old Market. In and around the city there are museums, a [[lotus silk]] farm, traditional [[Apsaras|Apsara]] dance performances, a Cambodian cultural village, souvenir and handicraft shops, silk farms, rice paddies in the countryside, fishing villages and a [[Prek Toal|bird sanctuary]] near [[Tonlé Sap]], and a cosmopolitan drinking and dining scene. Siem Reap city, home to the famous [[Angkor Wat]] temples, was named the [[ASEAN]] City of Culture for the period 2021–2022 at the 9th Meeting of the ASEAN Ministers Responsible for Culture and Arts (AMCA) organized on Oct 22, 2020.<ref name="Siem Reap City selected as ASEAN City of Culture for 2021-2022">{{cite web |title= Siem Reap City selected as ASEAN City of Culture for 2021–2022 |date= 24 October 2020 |url= https://www.khmertimeskh.com/50776465/siem-reap-city-selected-as-asean-city-of-culture-for-2021-2022/ |publisher= khmertimeskh.com |access-date=25 October 2020}}</ref>

Today, Siem Reap has many hotels, resorts, and restaurants, due to its proximity to the [[Angkor Wat]] temples, Cambodia's most popular [[tourist attraction]].

==History==
[[File:Thais return Battambang to King Sisowath.jpg|thumb|right|Sisophon, Battambang, and Angkor returned to King Sisowath, 1907]]

The name "Siem Reap" can be translated to mean 'defeat of [[Siam]]' (''siem'' in Khmer), and is commonly taken as a reference to an incident in the centuries-old conflict between the Siamese and Khmer kingdoms, although this is probably apocryphal. According to oral tradition, King Ang Chan (1516–1566) had named the town "Siem Reap" after he repulsed an army sent to invade Cambodia by the Thai king [[Maha Chakkraphat]] in 1549.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_CQjBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA34 |title=Elephants in Thailand Vol 3: White Elephants in Thailand and Neighboring Countries |author= Joachim Schliesinger |page=32 |publisher=White Lotus |year=2012 |isbn= 978-9744801890 }}</ref> Scholars such as [[Michael Vickery]] consider this derivation to be simply a modern folk etymology, and maintain that while the names Siem Reap and [[Chenla]], the old Chinese name for Cambodia, may perhaps be related, the actual origin of the name is unknown.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rs4IBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT53 |author=Zhou Daguan|title= A Record of Cambodia |translator= Peter Harris |publisher=University of Washington Press |year= 2007 |isbn=978-9749511244 }}</ref>

[[File:Riverside Villa in Siem Reap - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|Former residence of the French governor of Siem Reap; repurposed in 2019 as the FCC Angkor hotel (an affiliate of [[Foreign Correspondents' Club, Phnom Penh|FCC Phnom Penh]])]]

The traditional tale claims that King Ang Chan of Cambodia tried to assert greater independence from Siam, which was then struggling internally. The Siamese king [[Chairacha]] had been poisoned by his concubine, Lady Sri Sudachan, who had committed adultery with a commoner, [[Worawongsathirat]], while the king was away leading a campaign against the Kingdom of [[Lan Na]]. Sudachan then placed her lover on the throne. The Thai nobility lured them outside the city on a royal [[Royal Barge Procession|procession by barge]] to inspect a newly discovered white elephant. After killing the usurper, along with Sudachan and their new-born daughter, they invited [[Maha Chakkraphat|Prince Thianracha]] to leave the monkhood and assume the throne as King Maha Chakkraphat (1548–1569). With the Thais distracted by internal problems, King Ang Chan attacked. He seized the Siamese city of [[Prachinburi]] in 1549, sacking the city and making slaves of its inhabitants. Only then did he learn that the succession had been settled and that Maha Chakkraphat was the new ruler. Ang Chan immediately retreated to Cambodia, taking captives with him. King Maha Chakkraphat was furious over the unprovoked attack, but Burma had also chosen to invade through [[Three Pagodas Pass]]. The Burmese army posed a much more serious threat, as it captured [[Kanchanaburi]] and [[Suphanburi]]. It then appeared before Ayutthaya itself.

The Thai army managed to defeat the Burmese, who quickly retreated through the pass. Maha Chakkraphat's thoughts then turned to Cambodia. Not only had Ang Chan attacked and looted Prachinburi, turning its people into slaves, but he also refused to give Maha Chakkraphat a white elephant he had requested, rejecting even this token of submission to Siam.<ref name="Sochaczewski2009">{{cite book|author=Paul Spencer Sochaczewski|title=The Sultan and the Mermaid Queen: Surprising Asian People, Places and Things that Go Bump in the Night|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DowhYaCXBEQC&pg=PA100|date=29 January 2009|publisher=Editions Didier Millet|isbn=978-981-4217-74-3|pages=100–}}</ref> Maha Chakkraphat ordered Prince Ong, the governor of [[Sawankhalok]], to lead an expedition to punish Ang Chan and recover the Thai captives. The rival armies met, and Ang Chan killed Prince Ong with a lucky musket shot from an elephant's back. The leaderless Thai army fled, and Ang Chan allegedly captured more than 10,000 Siamese soldiers. To celebrate his great victory, King Ang Chan supposedly named the battleground "Siem Reap", meaning 'the total defeat of Siam'.

In reality, surviving historic sources make this derivation appear unlikely, since they date the decline of [[Angkor]] to more than a century before this, when a military expedition from Ayutthaya captured and sacked Angkor Wat, which began a long period of [[Vassal state|vassal rule]] over Cambodia.<ref name="Bowman2013">{{cite book|author=John Stewart Bowman|title=Columbia Chronologies of Asian History and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cYoHOqC7Yx4C&pg=PA511|date=13 August 2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-50004-3|pages=511–}}</ref> The 1431 capture coincided with the decline of Angkor, though the reasons behind its abandonment are not clear. They may have included environmental changes and failings of the Khmer infrastructure.<ref name="Stone2006">{{cite journal|last1=Stone|first1=R.|title=The End of Angkor|journal=Science|volume=311|issue=5766|year=2006|pages=1364–1368|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.311.5766.1364|pmid=16527940|s2cid=161796031}}</ref>

From the 16th to the 19th centuries, infighting among the Khmer nobility led to periodic intervention and domination by both of Cambodia's more powerful neighbors, Vietnam and Siam. Siem Reap, along with [[Battambang]] (Phra Tabong) and [[Sisophon]], major cities in northwest Cambodia, was under Siamese administration and the provinces were collectively known as Inner Cambodia from 1795 until 1907, when they were ceded to [[French Indochina]]. During the 18th century, under the rule of the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], it was known as [[Siam Nakhon Province|Nakhon Siam]] ('Siam's city').<ref name="FryNieminen2013">{{cite book|author1=Gerald W.

=== Re-discovery of Angkor ===
[[File:A part of Siem Reap.JPG|thumb|left|Sivutha Boulevard downtown]]

Siem Reap was little more than a village when French explorers such as [[Henri Mouhot]] "re-discovered" Angkor in the 19th century. However, European visitors had visited the temple ruins much earlier, including [[António da Madalena]] in 1586.<ref>Higham, ''The Civilization of Angkor'' pp. 1–2.</ref> In 1901, the [[École française d'Extrême-Orient]] (EFEO) ('French School of the Far East') began a long association with [[Angkor]] by funding an expedition into Siam to the [[Bayon]]. The EFEO took responsibility for clearing and restoring the whole site. In the same year, the first Western tourists arrived in Angkor, a total of about 200 in just three months. Angkor had been "rescued" from the jungle and was assuming its place in the modern world.

[[File:Grand Hotel dAngkor SiemReap.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Grand Hotel d'Angkor]], built in the mid-1920s.]]

With the acquisition of Angkor by the French in 1907 following a Franco-Siamese treaty, Siem Reap began to grow. The Grand Hotel d'Angkor opened in 1929 and the temples of Angkor became one of Asia's leading draws until the late-1960s, when civil war kept tourists away. In 1975, the population of Siem Reap, like all other Cambodian cities and towns, was driven into the countryside by the communist [[Khmer Rouge]].

Siem Reap's recent history is colored by the horror of the Khmer Rouge regime. Since [[Pol Pot]]'s death in 1998, however, relative stability and a rejuvenated tourist industry have revived the city and province.

'''Siem Reap''' now serves as a small gateway town to the world heritage site of Angkor Wat. In recent years, the city has regularly ranked in the top ten for "Best Destination" lists produced by entities such as TripAdvisor, ''Wanderlust Magazine'', and ''Travel+Leisure''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldofwanderlust.com/the-top-25-best-destinations-in-the-world/|title=The "Top 25" best destinations in the world|date=2015|work=Wanderlust}}</ref>

==What to do in Siem Reap?==
[[File:A bridge over Siem Reap River.JPG|thumb|left|A covered pedestrian bridge over the Siem Reap River, next to the Old Market in Siem Reap]]

{{Advert section|date=November 2024}}

'''Siem Reap''' is a cluster of small villages along the [[Siem Reap River]]. These villages were originally developed around [[Buddhist]] [[stupa]]s ([[wat]]s) that are almost evenly spaced along the river from Wat Preah En Kau Sei in the north to Wat [[Phnom Krom]] in the south, where the '''Siem Reap''' River meets [[Tonlé Sap]] lake.

Siem Reap is a vibrant city offering a blend of historical attractions, natural beauty, and modern amenities. The town center is concentrated around Sivatha Street and the Psar Chas area (Old Market), featuring colonial architecture, shopping, and commercial districts.

North Siem Reap is renowned for its ancient temples, including [[Angkor Wat]], [[Bayon]], [[Ta Prohm]], and [[Preah Khan]]. These iconic structures offer a glimpse into the [[Khmer Empire]]'s grandeur.

South Siem Reap boasts a more authentic atmosphere, with lotus lakes, the unique [[Lotus silk]] Farm,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lotussilkfarm.com/ |title=Welcome to Lotus Silk Farm |location=[[Siem Reap]], Cambodia |date=2024 |access-date=November 4, 2024 }}</ref> the original floating villages on [[Tonlé Sap]], and the sunset spot of [[Phnom Krom]] Temple.

Wat Bo is a popular area for guesthouses and restaurants, while Psar Leu is filled with food, clothing, and woodcarvings.

==Economy==
[[File:Khmerr restaurant dancer.jpg|thumb|upright|Dancer performing for tourists at a restaurant]]

Tourism is a very important aspect of the economy of Siem Reap: it was estimated in 2010 that over 50% of jobs in the town were related to the tourism industry.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume= 50 |date= January 2015| pages= 98–112|title=Limits to mass tourism's effects in rural peripheries|author=Robin Biddulph|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2014.11.011|doi-access=free}}</ref> The city has seen a massive increase in tourist arrivals in the decades since the end of the [[Khmer Rouge]] era, and businesses centered on tourism have flourished due to the tourism boom. Visitor numbers were negligible in the mid-1990s, but by 2004, over half a million foreign visitors had arrived in Siem Reap Province that year, approximately 50% of all foreign tourists in Cambodia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tourismcambodia.com/Statistics/index.asp?Year=2005 |title=Executive Summary from Jan–Dec 2005 |access-date=25 April 2008 |work=Tourism of Cambodia |publisher=Statistics & Tourism Information Department, Ministry of Tourism of Cambodia| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080413115411/http://www.tourismcambodia.com/Statistics/index.asp?Year=2005| archive-date= 13 April 2008 | url-status= dead}}</ref> By 2012, tourist numbers had reached over two million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tourismcambodia.org/images/mot/statistic_reports/tourism_statistics_annual_report_2012.pdf |title=Tourism Annual Report 2012 |work=Ministry of Tourism |access-date=20 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027011521/http://www.tourismcambodia.org/images/mot/statistic_reports/tourism_statistics_annual_report_2012.pdf |archive-date=27 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Angkor Wat===
{{Main|Angkor Wat}}
[[File:Buddhist monks in front of the Angkor Wat.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Buddhist monks in front of [[Angkor Wat]]]]

Angkor Wat ([[Wat]] temple) is the central feature of the Angkor [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], containing the remains of the [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] civilization. Angkor Wat's rising series of five towers culminates in an impressive central tower that symbolizes the mythical [[Mount Meru]]. Thousands of feet of wall space are covered with carvings depicting scenes from [[Hindu mythology]]. The most important are the carved bas-reliefs of the Hindu narratives. They tell a story about gods fighting demons in order to reclaim order, which can only be achieved by recovering the elixir of life known as [[amrita]]. The gods and demons must work together to release it and then battle to attain it.

===Angkor Thom===
