'''Sokoto''' '''State''' ([[Hausa language|Hausa]]: {{lang|ha|Jihar Sokoto}}; [[Fulfulde|Fula]]: {{lang|ff|ðž¤¤ðž¤«ðž¤´ðž¤£ðž¤­ ðž¤§ðž¤®ðž¥…ðž¤³ðž¤®ðž¥…ðž¤¼ðž¤®ðž¥…}}, ''Leydi Sokoto'') is one of the 36 [[states of Nigeria]], located in the extreme northwest of the country. Bounded by [[Niger|Republic of the Niger]] to the north and west for 363&nbsp;km (226 miles), and the states of [[Zamfara State|Zamfara]] to the east, and [[Kebbi State|Kebbi]] to the south and west, partly across the [[Ka River]]. Its capital and largest city is the [[Sokoto|city of Sokoto]]. Sokoto is located near to the confluence of the [[Sokoto River]] and the [[Rima River]]. As of 2022 it has an estimated [[Population growth|population]] of more than 6.3 million.

Being the seat of the former [[Sokoto Caliphate]], the city is predominantly Muslim and an important seat of Islamic learning in Nigeria. The [[List of Sultans of Sokoto|Sultan]] who heads the caliphate is effectively the spiritual leader of Nigerian Muslims.

== Etymology ==
The name ''Sokoto'' (which is the modern/[[anglicised]] version of the local name, ''Sakkwato'') is of [[Arabic]] origin, representing suk, "market". It is also known as ''Sakkwato, Birnin Shaihu da Bello'' or "Sokoto, Capital of Shaihu and Bello".

==History==
Since its creation as a state in 1976 (from the [[wikt:bifurcation|bifurcation]] of the erstwhile [[North-Western State]] ([[States of Nigeria#1967-1976|Map]]) into Sokoto and [[Niger State]]s, Sokoto state has been ruled by [[governors]], most ex-military officers, who succeeded each another at short intervals.

Sokoto, as a region, knows a longer history. During the reign of the [[Fulani Empire]] in the 19th century Sokoto was an important [[Fula people|Fula]] state, in addition to being a city, of what was then west central Nigeria.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Sokoto State of Nigeria :: Nigeria Information & Guide|url=https://www.nigeriagalleria.com/Nigeria/States_Nigeria/Sokoto/|access-date=2022-02-11|website=www.nigeriagalleria.com}}</ref>

From ca. 1900, with the [[United Kingdom|British]] take-over, Sokoto, which then encompassed the entire north-west corner of Nigeria, became a province of the British [[protectorate]] of [[Nigeria]]. Not long after [[Gwandu|Gando]] was added as a sub-province.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Sokoto |volume=25 |pages=353â€“354 |inline=1 |first=Flora |last=Shaw |author-link=Flora Shaw, Lady Lugard}}</ref> This double province then covered an area of {{convert|90000|km2}} with an estimated population over 500,000. It included the then [[Zamfara State|Zamfara]] and [[Argungun]], or [[Kebbi State|Kebbi]], kingdoms.

The following excerpt from the [[1911 EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica|1911 ''EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica'']] offers some information from the perspective of the occupying British power:

{{blockquote|The province has been organized on the same principle as the other provinces of Northern Nigeria. A British [[Resident (title)|resident]] of the first class has been placed at Sokoto and assistant residents at other centres. British courts of justice have been established and British governors are quartered in the province. Detachments of civil police are also placed at the principal stations. The country has been assessed under the new system for taxes and is being opened as rapidly as possible for trade. After the establishment of British rule farmers and herdsmen reoccupied districts and the inhabitants of cities flocked back to the land, rebuilding villages which had been deserted for fifty years. Horse breeding and cattle raising form the chief source of wealth in the province. There is some [[ostrich]] farming. Except in the sandy areas there is extensive agriculture, including rice and cotton. Special crops are grown in the valleys by irrigation. Weaving, dyeing and tanning are the principal native industries. Fair roads are in process of construction through the province. Trade is increasing and a cash currency has been introduced.

[...]

In 1906 a rising attributed to religious fanaticism occurred near Sokoto in which unfortunately three white officers lost their lives. The [[emir]] heartily repudiated the leader of the rising, who claimed to be a Mahdi inspired to drive the white man out of the country. A British force marched against the rebels, who were overthrown with great loss in March 1906. The leader was condemned to death in the emir's court and executed in the market place of Sokoto, and the incident was chiefly interesting for the display of loyalty to the British administration which it evoked on all sides from the native rulers.<ref name=EB1911/>}}

In 1967, not long after Nigeria's independence from the British, the region became known as the Northwestern State. This territory was, in 1976, split into Sokoto State and [[Niger State]]. Later on, [[Kebbi State]] (1991) and [[Zamfara State]] (1996) split off from Sokoto State.

==Demographics==

Sokoto State is mainly populated by [[Hausa people]], with Gobirawa found in Gobir and isa LGA.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Adebajo|first=Louis|date=2018-05-12|title=HOW TO IMPROVE ETHNIC RELATIONSHIPS IN NIGERIA|url=https://medium.com/@louisadebajo/how-to-improve-ethnic-relationships-in-nigeria-781165fb247a|access-date=2021-03-18|website=Medium|language=en}}</ref> Most Sokoto State residents are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]], with a [[Shia in Nigeria|Shia minority]]; violence between the two groups is uncommon. Over 80% of people living in the state practice agriculture.

==Languages==
[[Hausa language|Hausa]] and [[Fulfulde]] are dominant. The [[Kainji language]] [[Ut-Ma'in]] is also spoken in [[Kebbe]] LGA and the Kainji language [[Kamuku language|Kamuku]] is also spoken in [[Sokoto]] LGA. Minorities speak other languages such as [[Zarma language|Zarma]] and [[Tuareg language|Tuareg]].

==Geography==
[[File:Tireta forest in sokoto.jpg|thumb|393x393px|Tireta forest]]
Sokoto State is in the dry [[Sahel]], surrounded by sandy [[savannah]] and isolated hills.

With an annual average temperature of {{convert|28.3|Â°C|Â°F|1}}, Sokoto is, on the whole, a very hot area. However, maximum daytime temperatures are for most of the year generally under {{convert|40|Â°C|Â°F|1}} and the dryness makes the heat bearable. The warmest months are February to April when daytime temperatures can exceed {{convert|45|Â°C|Â°F|1}}. The rainy season is from June to October during which showers are a daily occurrence. The showers rarely last long and are a far cry from the regular torrential rain known in wet tropical regions. From late October to February, during the ''cold season'', the climate is dominated by the [[Harmattan]] wind blowing [[Sahara]] dust over the land. The dust dims the sunlight thereby lowering temperatures significantly and also leading to the inconvenience of dust everywhere in houses.<ref name=":0" />

The region's lifeline for growing crops is the floodplains of the Sokoto-Rima river system (see [[Sokoto River]]), which are covered with rich [[alluvial soil]]. For the rest, the general dryness of the region allows for few crops, [[millet]] perhaps being the most abundant, complemented by rice, corn, other cereals and beans. Apart from tomatoes few vegetables grow in the region.

== Politics ==
The state government is led by a democratically elected governor who works closely with members of the state's house of assembly. The capital city of the state is Sokoto.

=== Electoral system ===
The governor of the state is selected using a modified two-round system. To be elected in the first round, a candidate must receive the plurality of votes and over 25% of the vote in at least two-third of the state local government areas. If no candidate passes threshold, a second round will be held between the top candidate and the next candidate to have received a plurality of votes in the highest number of local government areas.
