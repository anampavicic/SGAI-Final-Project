'''Whitby''' is a [[town]] in [[Regional Municipality of Durham|Durham Region]]. Whitby is located in [[Southern Ontario]] east of [[Ajax, Ontario|Ajax]] and west of [[Oshawa]], on the north shore of [[Lake Ontario]] and is home to the headquarters of Durham Region. It had a population of 138,501 at the [[2021 Canadian census|2021 census]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Government of Canada |first=Statistics Canada |date=2022-02-09 |title=2021 Census of Population geographic summary: Whitby, Town (T) [Census subdivision], Ontario |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/search-recherche/productresults-resultatsproduits-eng.cfm |access-date=2022-11-21 |website=www12.statcan.gc.ca |archive-date=2022-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221121230334/https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/search-recherche/productresults-resultatsproduits-eng.cfm |url-status=live }}</ref> It is approximately {{cvt|45|km|mi}} east of [[Toronto]], and it is known as a commuter [[suburb]] in the [[Durham Region]], a part of the [[Greater Toronto Area]]. While the southern portion of Whitby is predominantly urban and an economic hub, the northern part of the municipality is more rural and includes the communities of [[Ashburn, Ontario|Ashburn]], [[Brooklin, Ontario|Brooklin]], [[Myrtle, Ontario|Myrtle]], [[Myrtle Station, Ontario|Myrtle Station]], and [[Macedonian Village, Ontario|Macedonian Village]].

==History==
[[File:Lynde House Museum - Whitby, Ontario, Canada.jpg|thumb|Lynde House Museum, {{Circa|1812|lk=no}}]]

[[Whitby Township, Ontario|Whitby Township]] (now the Town of Whitby) was named after the seaport town of [[Whitby|Whitby, Yorkshire, England]].

When the township was originally surveyed in 1792, the surveyor, from the northern part of England, named the townships east of Toronto after towns in the historic [[North Riding of Yorkshire]]: [[York]], [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], [[Pickering, North Yorkshire|Pickering]], [[Whitby]] and [[Darlington]].<ref>Winter, Brian (1999); ''Chronicles of a County Town: Whitby Past and Present''. {{ISBN|0-9685745-0-5}}, p. 8</ref> The original name of "Whitby" is [[Danish language|Danish]], dating from about 867 AD when the Danes invaded Britain. It is a contraction of "Whitteby", meaning "White Village". The allusion may be to the white lighthouse on the pier at Whitby, Yorkshire, and also at Whitby, Ontario. Although settlement dates back to 1800, it was not until 1836 that a downtown business centre was established by Whitby's founder [[Peter Perry (politician)|Peter Perry]].

Whitby's chief asset was its fine natural harbour on Lake Ontario, from which grain from the farmland to the north was first shipped in 1833. In the 1840s, a road was built from Whitby Harbour to [[Lake Simcoe]] and [[Georgian Bay]], to bring trade and settlement through the harbour to and from the rich hinterland to the north. The Town of Whitby was chosen as the seat of government for the newly formed [[Ontario County, Ontario|County of Ontario]] in 1852, and incorporated in 1855. The remainder of Whitby Township remained a separate municipality, although the eastern half surrounding Oshawa was incorporated as the new Township of East Whitby in 1857. In the 1870s, a railway, the "[[Port Whitby and Port Perry Railway]]", was constructed from Whitby harbour to [[Port Perry]], and later extended to [[Lindsay, Ontario|Lindsay]] as the "Whitby, Port Perry and Lindsay Railway".

Whitby is also the site of [[Trafalgar Castle School]], a private girls' school founded in 1874. The building, constructed as an Elizabethan-style castle in 1859–62 as a private residence for the Sheriff of Ontario County, is a significant architectural landmark and Whitby's only provincial historic site marked with a plaque. The school celebrated its 125th anniversary in 1999.

During the [[Second World War]], Whitby was the location of [[Camp X]], a secret spy training facility established by [[William Stephenson|Sir William Stephenson]], the "Man Called Intrepid". Although the buildings have since been demolished, a monument was unveiled on the site of Camp X in 1984 by Ontario's [[Lieutenant Governor of Ontario|Lieutenant Governor]] [[John Black Aird]]. Following the war, Soviet dissenter [[Igor Gouzenko]] was taken to the facility with his wife to live in secretive protective custody after fleeing [[Ottawa, Ontario]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://spartacus-educational.com/SSgouzenko.htm |title=Igor Gouzenko |newspaper=Spartacus Educational |access-date=2017-01-17 |archive-date=2023-08-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230829025136/https://spartacus-educational.com/SSgouzenko.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Amalgamation==
In 1968, the Town of Whitby and Township of Whitby amalgamated to form the current municipality. Planning for the construction of a town hall intended to centralize municipal staff working in satellite offices began in 1970 under mayor Des Newman. Construction began on the [[Raymond Moriyama]] designed building in 1975; it was opened by Mayor Jim Gartshore on January 8, 1977.<ref name="Ferencz">{{cite news |last1=Ferencz |first1=Sarah |title=Whitby town hall celebrates 40 years |url=http://www.durhamregion.com/opinion-story/7074632-whitby-town-hall-celebrates-40-years/ |access-date=27 January 2017 |work=www.durhamregion.com |date=27 January 2017 |archive-date=29 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230829025707/https://www.durhamregion.com/news/whitby-town-hall-celebrates-40-years/article_c1563efb-5a6e-5510-93c0-002211a63927.html? |url-status=live }}</ref>

Municipal boundaries were not changed during the 1974 formation of the [[Regional Municipality of Durham]] (or Durham Region as locals call it), and remain to this day. Today, Whitby is the seat of government in Durham Region. 

==Geography==

Whitby borders Ajax to the west, Pickering to the northwest, the Township of Scugog to the north, and Oshawa to the east. Since at least the mid-1990s, the development of subdivisions to accommodate population growth has proceeded in a mostly northward direction, including development in [[Brooklin, Ontario|Brooklin]]. To the south is [[Lake Ontario]].

Whitby is also home to the headquarters buildings of [[Durham Region]] and the [[Durham District School Board]].

==Emergency services==
Whitby is policed by the [[Durham Regional Police]]'s Central West Division. There is also a detachment of the [[Ontario Provincial Police]] located in Town, mainly to patrol area provincial highways within Durham Region. [[Fire Services in Durham Region|Whitby Fire & Emergency Services]] provides firefighting services from five fire stations and ambulance/emergency medical services are provided by [[Durham Region EMS]] at the Whitby Paramedic Station (also as EMS Headquarters).

==Economy==
Many residents commute to work in other Greater Toronto Area communities. Whitby itself is home to a steel mill operated by [[Gerdau|Gerdau Ameristeel]], a retail support centre operated by [[Sobeys]], and a major [[LCBO|Liquor Control Board of Ontario]] warehouse. Other companies present in Whitby include pharmaceutical manufacturer [[Patheon]], [[Lear Corporation]], [[Automodular Assemblies]], [[McGraw-Hill Ryerson]], and several others.

==Education==
Public education in Whitby is provided via the [[Durham District School Board]], which also has its headquarters in Whitby. There are twenty-four elementary schools and five secondary schools: [[Anderson Collegiate Vocational Institute]], [[Brooklin High School]], [[Donald A Wilson Secondary School]], [[Henry Street High School]] and [[Sinclair Secondary School]].

The [[Durham Catholic District School Board]] oversees public Catholic education in Durham Region. There are twelve Catholic elementary schools and two secondary schools- [[Father Leo J. Austin Catholic Secondary School]] and [[All Saints Catholic Secondary School]].

Full French-language education is provided by the [[Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir]]. There is one elementary school in Whitby, École élémentaire catholique Jean-Paul II (JK-grade 6), as well as a high school, École secondaire catholique St-Charles Garnier (grades 7-12) which services all of [[Durham Region]].

As noted above, Whitby is home to [[Trafalgar Castle School]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trafalgarcastle.ca/ |title=Home |publisher=Trafalgar Castle School |access-date=18 November 2018 |archive-date=14 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181114122147/https://www.trafalgarcastle.ca/ |url-status=live }}</ref> an independent school for women that offers grades 4 through 12 in a university preparatory programme. Built in 1859 by the Sheriff of Ontario County, Nelson Gilbert "Iron" Reynolds, Trafalgar Castle remains a unique Canadian treasure. The school opened its doors in 1874 and was called "Ontario Ladies' College" until 1979 when the name was changed to "Trafalgar Castle School".

There are also a number of [[Montessori]] schools offering programmes for early elementary grades.

Whitby is also the site of the Skills Training Centre of [[Durham College]]. The main campus of the college is located in Oshawa, as is [[Ontario Tech University]]. [[Canada Christian College]] is located in Whitby as well.

==Healthcare==
Although Whitby is one of the [[List of the largest municipalities in Canada by population|100 largest cities/towns in Canada]], it lacks a full-service hospital. The town was served by the Whitby General Hospital until 1998, when Durham hospitals were amalgamated by the [[Lakeridge Health Corporation]], Under the amalgamated system, the hospital became [[Lakeridge Health Whitby]] and is a specialized health centre, with the closest full-service hospitals being [[Lakeridge Health Oshawa]], [[Lakeridge Health Ajax and Pickering]] and [[Lakeridge Health Port Perry]].

The [[Ontario Shores Centre for Mental Health Sciences]] is located on the lakefront. It was originally called the [[Whitby Psychiatric Hospital]], then Whitby Mental Health Centre.

==Transportation==
[[Ontario Highway 401]] runs through the south end of Whitby, with interchanges at Brock Street and Thickson Road. [[Ontario Highway 407]] was opened in Whitby in 2016. The toll highway passes between Brooklin and the urban portion of the town. [[Ontario Highway 412]], connecting the 401 with the 407, also opened to traffic in the same year. The highway is a north–south route located just east of the Whitby-Ajax boundary and became toll-free on April 22, 2022.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.ontario.ca/en/release/1001631/ontario-government-removing-tolls-on-highways-412-and-418 |title=Ontario Government Removing Tolls on Highways 412 and 418 |date=February 18, 2022 |publisher=Government of Ontario |access-date=April 23, 2022 |archive-date=May 7, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220507224017/https://news.ontario.ca/en/release/1001631/ontario-government-removing-tolls-on-highways-412-and-418 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The southern terminus of [[Highway 12 (Ontario)|Highway 12]] is also located in Whitby. It originally extended from Highway 401 northward as part of Brock Street, but this portion was downloaded to Durham Region in 1997. The southern terminus is now located just south of Brooklin at Highway 407. Finally, [[Highway 7 (Ontario)|Highway 7]] runs east–west between Brooklin and the City of [[Pickering, Ontario|Pickering]]. At Brooklin, the road changes to a north–south alignment and is [[Concurrency (road)|multiplex]]ed with Highway 12 to the northern boundary of the Town.

Four railways pass through Whitby. The Toronto-Montreal corridor main lines of the [[Canadian National Railway]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] both pass east–west through the south end of town. A second CP line running from Toronto to [[Havelock, Ontario|Havelock]] also passes through the northern part of Whitby. [[Via Rail]] trains travel through Whitby, but the nearest station is in Oshawa. Finally, [[GO Transit]] provides frequent service via its [[Lakeshore East line]], which (in Whitby) runs parallel to the CN tracks. A [[Whitby GO Station|GO Station]] is located in Town.

Local transit services are provided by the region-wide [[Durham Region Transit]]. Prior to the Regional service, the Town provided its own service. GO Transit buses also connect Whitby with Durham Region (including [[Port Perry]] and [[Beaverton, Ontario|Beaverton]] to the north) and areas further afield.

Whitby Harbour, an important factor in the development of the Town, is now home to a 420-berth recreational marina.<ref>{{cite web |title=Marina |date=24 March 2022 |url=https://www.whitby.ca/en/play/marina.aspx |publisher=Town of Whitby |access-date=April 23, 2022 |archive-date=29 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230829025715/https://www.whitby.ca/en/play/marina.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref>

The closest international airport is [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]], located {{Convert|65|km|mi}} to the west in [[Mississauga]].

==Media==
Until publication ceased on September 15, 2023, Whitby was served by the ''Whitby This Week'' newspaper, part of the [[Metroland Media Group]]. Several other papers have been published in the town over the years, including the Whitby Free Press, which ran from 1971 to 1996. Other GTA media outlets serve the area, but since September 2023 there have been no newspapers serving Whitby.

In North Whitby, the ''[[Brooklin, Ontario|Brooklin]] Town Crier'' serves approximately 8,000 residents every two weeks.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=About us |url=http://www.brooklintowncrier.com/about-us.html |access-date=2022-11-21 |website=Brooklin Town Crier |language=en}}</ref> The ''Brooklin Town Crier'' was established in 2000 by Rhonda Mulcahy, who has since been elected Regional Councillor for Whitby.<ref name=":1" /> The paper consists primarily of resident contributions, with occasion updates on local and regional politics from Mulcahy.<ref name=":1" />[[File:Ontario County Court House- Centennial Building-Whitby-Ontario-HPC10545-20221005 (1).jpg|thumb|Whitby Courthouse Theater]]

==Sports==
[[File:Whitby Harbour.jpg|thumb|Whitby Harbour]]

Whitby's most famous sporting team is the [[Whitby Dunlops]], a celebrated [[ice hockey]] squad that captured the world championship in 1958 at [[Oslo]], [[Norway]]. This team featured long-time president of the [[Boston Bruins]], [[Harry Sinden]] and former mayor of Whitby, [[Bob Attersley]]. The Dunlops were revived in 2004 as part of the [[Eastern Ontario Senior Hockey League]].

The Whitby Yacht Club, which offers racing, cruising, social, and sail training programs on Whitby Harbour overlooking the [[Lake Ontario]], was founded in 1966.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wyc.ca/ |title=Home |publisher=Whitby Yacht Club |access-date=November 18, 2018 |archive-date=August 29, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230829030220/https://www.wyc.ca/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Lacrosse]] is also a prominent sport in Whitby. The [[Brooklin Redmen]] Senior A lacrosse club is one of the most successful in Canadian sporting history, while the Junior A [[Whitby Warriors]] have been awarded the [[Minto Cup]] four times since 1984.

Whitby is also home to the ''Iroquois Park Sports Centre'', one of the largest minor sports centres in North America. The facility includes six icepads, a swimming pool named for local Olympian [[Anne Ottenbrite]], six tennis courts, five ball diamonds, three batting cages, a [[skatepark]], a soccer pitch, ''The Sports Garden Cafe'' restaurant and the Whitby Sports Hall of Fame. Whitby also developed the McKinney Sports complex which boasts three ice pads, two tennis courts and a [[skatepark]], and Luther Vipond Arena in Brooklin, with one ice pad. These three sport complexes hold many sporting events.

In 2008, the [[Ontario Junior Hockey League|OJHL]] relocated a team to Whitby to play out of the Iroquois Complex, known as the [[Whitby Fury]].
