'''Ulyanovsk''',{{efn|{{lang-rus|links=no|Ульяновск|p=ʊˈlʲjanəfsk}}, {{langx|tt|Сембер}}, {{langx|cv|Чĕмпĕр}}}} known as '''Simbirsk{{efn|{{lang-rus|Симби́рск|p=sʲɪm⁽ʲ⁾ˈbʲirsk}}}}''' until 1924, is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] and the [[administrative center]] of [[Ulyanovsk Oblast]], Russia, located on the [[Volga River]] {{convert|705|km|sp=us}} east of [[Moscow]]. Ulyanovsk has been the only Russian [[UNESCO]] [[City of Literature]] since 2015.

The city was the birthplace of [[Vladimir Lenin]] (born Ulyanov), for whom it was renamed after his death in 1924; and of [[Alexander Kerensky]], the leader of the [[Russian Provisional Government]] which Lenin overthrew during the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. It is also famous for its writers such as [[Ivan Goncharov]], [[Nikolay Yazykov]] and [[Nikolay Karamzin]], and for painters such as [[Arkady Plastov]] and [[Nikas Safronov]].<ref>

==History==
Simbirsk was founded in 1648 by the [[boyar]] [[Bogdan Khitrovo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ulpressa.ru/2013/12/18/ot-bogdana-hitrovo-do-bogdana-hitrovo-2/|title = От Богдана Хитрово до Богдана Хитрово|date = December 18, 2013}}</ref>  The fort of "Simbirsk" (alternatively "Sinbirsk") was strategically placed on a hill on the Western bank of the [[Volga River]]. The fort was meant to protect the eastern frontier of the [[Tsardom of Russia]] from the nomadic tribes and to establish a permanent royal presence in the area.
In 1668, Simbirsk withstood a month-long siege by a 20,000-strong army led by rebel [[Cossacks|Cossack]] commander [[Stenka Razin]]. Also in Simbirsk another country rebel, [[Yemelyan Pugachev]], was imprisoned before execution. At the time Simbirsk possessed a wooden [[Kremlin (fortification)|kremlin]], which was destroyed by a fire during the 18th century.

As the eastern border of the Russian Empire was rapidly pushed into [[Siberia]], Simbirsk rapidly lost its strategic importance, but nonetheless began to develop into an important regional center. Simbirsk was granted city status in 1796.
[[File:Monument Karamzin.jpg|thumb|left|Monument to [[Nikolay Karamzin]].]]

Simbirsk was then considered an exclusive town favoured by the aristocracy, and besides its churches and a Governor's Place, included an Assembly Of The Nobles, with a magnificent library.<ref>[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/197546795 A Russian Conflagration, Mount Alexander Mail,16 Nov 1864, p3]</ref> The Holy Trinity Cathedral was constructed in a restrained [[Neoclassical style]] between 1827 and 1841. In the summer of 1864, in what was believed an arson attack, Simbirsk was mostly destroyed by fire. However, it was quickly rebuilt and continued to grow. Its population, which was 26,000 in 1856, had reached 43,000 by 1897.

In 1924, the city was renamed Ulyanovsk in honor of Vladimir Ulyanov, better known as [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], who was born in Simbirsk in 1870. Two other Russian political leaders, [[Alexander Kerensky]] and [[Alexander Protopopov]], were also born in Simbirsk.

The construction of the [[Zhiguli Hydroelectric Station|Kuybyshev hydroelectric plant]] (completed in 1957) {{convert|200|km|sp=us}} downstream of Ulyanovsk resulted in the flooding of significant tracts of land both north and south of Ulyanovsk and [[Kuybyshev reservoir|increasing the width]] of the Volga by up to {{convert|35|km|sp=us}} in some places. To this day, some populated neighborhoods of Ulyanovsk remain well below the level of the reservoir, protected from flooding by a dam: it is estimated that its catastrophic failure would submerge parts of the city comprising around 5% of its total population with as much as {{convert|10|m|sp=us}} of water.

During the Soviet period, Ulyanovsk was an important tourist center, drawing visitors from around the country because of its revolutionary importance.

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the tourist importance of Ulyanovsk sharply decreased. In the 1990s, the city went through the hardest times—a slump in production in all branches, mass unemployment, and a population impoverishment. In the first decade of the 2000s the economy started to grow.

Ulyanovsk slowly recovered from these downturns into regional manufacturing, educational and transportation [[business cluster|cluster]]s.

==Politics==
[[File:Legislative Assembly of Ulyanovsk Oblast-1.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Ulyanovsk Oblast Administration]]
The city is headed by a mayor who is the executive branch, and city council which is the legislative branch. The term of the mayor is five years. In 2010 the city council abolished the direct elections to the mayor, replacing it with city manager, appointed by the council. Then again, in April 2013 the city charter was amended to re-introduce the direct mayoral election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2013/04/17/mayor/|title=В Ульяновске вернули прямые выборы мэра|work=Lenta.ru|date=April 17, 2013|access-date=January 26, 2014}}</ref>

==Administrative and municipal status==
Ulyanovsk serves as the [[administrative center]] of the [[oblast]].<ref name="OffSite" /> Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is, together with thirty [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|rural localities]], incorporated as the '''[[city of federal subject significance|city of oblast significance]] of Ulyanovsk'''—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Ulyanovsk Oblast|districts]].<ref name="Ref150">Law #126-ZO</ref> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the city of oblast significance of Ulyanovsk is incorporated as '''Ulyanovsk Urban Okrug'''.<ref name="Ref310">Law #043-ZO</ref>

===Tourism and hospitality industry===
[[File:Central Bank of Russia.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bank of Russia]] in Ulyanovsk]]
Tourism is a growing industry in the city and the surrounding areas because of [[Volga]] [[micro-climate]] and historical significance of [[Simbirsk]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/russia/volga-region/ulyanovsk|title=Volga Region travel}}</ref> [[Hilton Hotel]] Group and [[Marriott Hotels & Resorts]] are building their hotels in the downtown area.

The region of Undory, a driving distance from Ulyanovsk is famous for its spas and mineral water. The city offers many options for sports enthusiasts. The countryside is ideal for outdoor and water sports. The springs of Undory have been known for more than 200 years. The water at spa is rich in sodium chloride, and comes from artesian wells.

===Transportation and logistics===
[[File:Президентский мост через р. Волгу.jpg|thumb|left|The [[President Bridge]].]]
[[File:Volga Ulyanovsk-oliv.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Imperial Bridge]] across the [[Volga River]] in Ulyanovsk.]]
A railway bridge across the [[Volga]] was built in 1912–1916 and two automobile lanes were added to it in 1953–1958, allowing for the city to expand on the Eastern (left) bank of the river and transforming it into a local [[transport hub]].

According to Ulyanovsk Region Development Corporation, [[Ulyanovsk Region]] is conveniently situated in the center of the European part of Russia, where east west and north south air, rail, car and river routes cross. It has an industrial, transport and business infrastructure and a developed network of roads and railways which provide a good basis for turning Ulyanovsk into a major transport and logistics hub in the Volga Federal district working not only for Ulyanovsk Region's plants but the whole Volga federal district. Ulyanovsk transport hub provides all forms of transport (busy [[river port]] and [[Water port Terminal|passenger terminal]], railways with two major passenger and cargo stations, airports and now two major bridges) apart from sea, which can serve Russian and international [[cargo]] traffic to [[Kazakhstan]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]], Europe, China and back.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ulregion.com/en/|title=Ulyanovsk Region Development Corporation, OJSC}}</ref>

As the aging Ulyanovsk bridge, the only crossing of the Volga in the 400&nbsp;km stretch from [[Kazan]] to [[Tolyatti]], could no longer cope with the growing needs of the city, the construction of [[President Bridge]], a [[truss bridge]], began in the late 1980s. Completion was delayed significantly due to catastrophic economic circumstances following the end of the Soviet Union. Its official opening ceremony was on November 24, 2009, by the Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] – although traffic was using the bridge a few days earlier.{{citation needed|date=March 2023}} The bridge has a total length of 5.5&nbsp;km, making it one of the longest in Europe.<ref name="eng-rosoez-news-media-162625">[http://eng.rosoez.ru/news/media/162625/The Minister of Transport Russian Federation Igor Levitin in the course of working trip to Ulyanovsk Region will estimate the possibility of SEZ creation of port type], [[PRIME-TASS]], [[Saransk]], June 17, 2008</ref>

The city is divided by the [[Sviyaga River|river Sviyaga]], a tributary of the Volga whose confluence with it is about 200&nbsp;km north of the city.

Public transportation in the city is well developed and provided by 17 tram lines, 7 trolleybus routes (and all tram lines are only on the right-bank part of the city, and all the trolley only on the left bank), 50 municipal bus routes, and about 150 fixed-route taxi ([[marshrutka]]s) lines. The City of Ulyanovsk has a working plan to build [[high-speed rail]] system to connect the two banks of the town.

Ulyanovsk is served by the [[Ulyanovsk Vostochny Airport]] (the international airport) in the left-bank part of the city and [[Ulyanovsk Baratayevka Airport]] (Ulyanovsk Central Airport) in the right-bank part of the city.

There is also a large number of technical and medical [[community college]]s in Ulyanovsk.

==Architecture==
During the Soviet period, Ulyanovsk lost much of its historical heritage due to both neglect and intentional destruction. All traces of the original wooden fort have disappeared, as have the churches of old Simbirsk; the majority of 19th-century buildings remain in the city, including the houses where Lenin lived between 1870 and 1887. The restoration of the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity was considered, but has since been canceled. However, many historical constructions remain. Among them the house in which writer [[Ivan Goncharov]] was born, the Protestant church and other buildings.
[[File:Главный дом. площадь 100-летия со дня рождения В.И. Ленина.JPG|thumb|The house where Lenin was born]]
Ulyanovsk is home to several tourist destinations around the downtown museum district and famous [[Volga River]] tours.
