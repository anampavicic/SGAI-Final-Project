==Etymology==
Cali is the shortened form of the official name of the city: Santiago de Cali. "Santiago" honors [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]] whose [[feast day]] is celebrated on 25 July. The origin of the word "Cali" comes from the local Amerindians, the "[[Calima culture|Calima]]".

[[File:Calima - Ceremonial Tweezers - Walters 57262.jpg|thumb|Calima culture gold ceremonial tweezers from [[Walters Art Museum]].]]

Before the arrival of the Spaniards, the region was inhabited by indigenous tribes, mostly speakers of [[Cariban languages]]. In the region between the [[Cauca River]] and the Western Cordillera, the Gorrones established themselves between the present day [[Roldanillo]] and Santiago de Cali. The biggest town of the Morrones was sited on the River Pescador near the present-day towns of [[Zarzal]] and [[Bugalagrande]]. The Morrones traded with the [[Quimbaya civilization|Quimbayas]] who inhabited the north of the [[Valle del Cauca]].

On his way to Cali, [[Sebastián de Belalcázar]] first met the Timbas who ran away before the arrival of the men, leaving behind gold. After the Timbas, towards the north, the Spaniards entered the territory of the chief Jamundí and his tribe, the Jamundíes, between the rivers Pance and [[Jamundí]]. This tribe offered a strong resistance to the invaders, fighting with poisonous darts and arrows against the [[arquebus]]es and swords of the Spaniards. Eventually, the Spanish prevailed in the struggle over the central valley.

Before taking control over the region, the Spaniards had to defeat the chief Petecuy, whose tribe inhabited the area between the river Lilí and the Western Cordillera. Petecuy formed a large army with many tribes and fought the Spaniards on [[Holy Tuesday]] of 1536. The natives lost to the Spaniards and the region was divided in ''[[encomienda]]s''.

Santiago de Cali was important for Belalcázar because it was outside the [[Inca empire]]. After the capture and execution of the Inca [[Atahualpa]] at [[Cajamarca]], [[Francisco Pizarro]] had sent Belalcázar to take possession of [[Guayaquil]] and Quito on his behalf, but Cali, being outside the Quechua empire, was claimed by Belalcazar as his own territory. After his death, his descendants maintained possession of much of the land until the [[Patria Boba|war of independence against Spain]].

===Founding and colonial period===
[[File:Sebastian de belalcazar fundador.jpg|left|thumb|[[Sebastián de Belalcázar]].]]
[[File:La Merced.JPG|thumb|La Merced.]]

The founder of Cali, [[Sebastián de Belalcázar]], came to the American continent in the third voyage made by Columbus in 1498. In 1532, after serving in [[Darién Province|Darién]] and Nicaragua, he joined [[Francisco Pizarro]] in the conquest of Perú. In 1534, Belalcázar separated from Pizarro's expedition to find the city of [[Quito]], and later in his search of [[El Dorado]] he entered the territory of what is now Colombia, founding the cities of [[Pasto, Colombia|Pasto]] and [[Popayán]].

Belalcázar founded Santiago de Cali on 25 July 1536, a few kilometres north of its present location, near what are now the towns of [[Vijes]] and [[Riofrío, Valle del Cauca|Riofrío]]. Under the orders of Belalcázar, captain Miguel Muñoz moved the city to its present location in 1537, where the chaplain Brother Santos de Añasco celebrated a mass in the place occupied by the Church La Merced today, and Belalcázar designated Pedro de Ayala as the first municipal authority.

During the ''Colonia'' (colonial period), Santiago de Cali was part of the ''gobernación'' of Popayán, which was part of [[Quito]]'s Audiencia. Although initially Cali was the capital of Popayán's ''gobernación'', Belalcázar moved this function to Popayán in 1540, owing to "better" weather there.

Until the 18th century, most of the territory of what is now Santiago de Cali was occupied by haciendas (cattle farms and plantations of food, with some sugar cane), and the city was only a small town near the [[Cali River]]. In 1793, Santiago de Cali had 6,548 inhabitants, 1,106 of whom were (African) slaves. The haciendas were the property of the dominant noble class with many slaves dedicated mostly to stockbreeding and raising sugar cane crops. Many of these haciendas became zone of the present city like Cañaveralejo, Chipichape, Pasoancho, Arroyohondo, Cañasgordas, Limonar and Meléndez. Santiago de Cali was strategically positioned for trade, centrally located in relation to the mining regions of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]], [[Department of Chocó|Chocó]], and Popayán. The first trail for mules and horses between Santiago de Cali and the port of [[Buenaventura, Colombia|Buenaventura]] was completed in the colonial period.

===Independence===
On 3 July 1810, Santiago de Cali refused to recognize the [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Council of Regency]] of Spain, and established its own junta. This local uprising predates the national one in [[Bogotá]] by 17 days.<ref>Mendoza Neira, Plinio, ed. ''Cali: La sultana del Valle'' (Librería Colombiana Camacho Roldán, 1962).</ref> The Governor of [[Popayán]], [[Miguel Tacón y Rosique|Miguel Tacón]] organized an army to control the uprising. The people from Cali called for help to the "Junta Suprema" in Bogotá, which sent a contingent under colonel Antonio Baraya to support the independence cause. For mutual defense, Cali also formed, with Anserma, [[Cartago, Colombia|Cartago]], Toro, [[Buga, Valle del Cauca|Buga]] and Caloto, the Confederated cities of the Cauca Valley, which [[Patria Boba|declared independence]] from the [[Governorate]] of Popayán on 1 February 1811, although they continued to recognize the absent [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] as their [[head of state]]. On 28 March 1811 in the battle of Bajo Palacé, the first in Colombia's Independence, the royalist Spanish army was defeated by the revolutionary army commanded by colonel Antonio Baraya with a detachment of 120 soldiers from his native Cundinamarca and a huge garrison of 1.080 men from Valle del Cauca led by brothers [[Miguel and Francisco Cabal Barona]].<ref>Zawadzky C., Alfonso, ''Comentario al libro'' Las Ciudades Confederadas del Valle del Cauca en 1811. Bogotá, Editorial Librería Voluntad, S.A., 1943.</ref>

In the following years there were many battles between royalists and local militia. After having been released from captivity by Napoleon, Ferdinand VII sent a large army under the command of the "''Pacificador''" (Pacifier) [[Pablo Morillo]] who restored royalist rule in the area by 1816.

In 1819, after [[Simón Bolívar]] defeated the bulk of the royalist army in the [[Battle of Boyacá]], there were new uprisings in the Valle del Cauca and the [[Criollo people|Criollos]] took control permanently. In 1822, Bolívar arrived in Santiago de Cali. The city was an important military outpost and the region contributed many men to the war of independence that liberated the nations in the south.

===Modernism===

[[File:Mapa-cali-1880s-WEB.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Map of Cali in about 1882–1884, Spanish edition.]]
In the 19th century Cali, capital of the Valley of the Cauca department, was a quiet community with no more than 20,000 inhabitants. The urban center of the city was around the neighborhoods of Altozano and San Antonio.

Outside the city there were [[mango]] plantations, pastures and communal land that were transferred from the Spanish Crown to the working classes. From the market gardens on this land the city was supplied with food. The economy centered around livestock, sugar cane, [[panela]] (jaggery; a sugar derivative), cheese and gold mined in the Pacific. There was also a growing industrial and financial sector.

Jewish entrepreneurs came during the 18th and 19th centuries and achieved prominent positions in the city. Some married local women and felt they had to diminish or abandon their identity. These included the De Lima, Salazar, Espinoza, Arias, Ramirez, Perez and Lobo families from the Caribbean, as well as the author [[Jorge Isaacs]] of English Jewish ancestry, and the industrialist [[James Martin Eder]] (who adopted the more Christian name of Santiago Eder when he translated his name to Spanish) born into the [[Latvian Jew]]ish community. Over the generations most of their descendants were raised as secular Christians.

Around 1890 the Company of Public Works of Cauca, a private venture, built the market plaza. This spurred commercial development and it transformed into the Plaza Mayor or Plaza de Caycedo. In 1921, the market was sold to the Cali municipality. Very close to the 9th street was the principal station of the ''[[Tram|tranvia]]'' of Cali, a system of public transportation that linked the city with suburban areas.

On 7 August 1956, at around 1&nbsp;a.m., seven [[Colombian army]] trucks filled with 42 [[ton]]s of [[dynamite]] exploded near the train station, destroying eight city blocks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museonacional.gov.co/cali.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610223111/http://www.museonacional.gov.co/cali.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 June 2007 |publisher=Museo Nacional de Colombia |title=Cali, la explosión de 1956: catástrofe histórica}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.elpais.com.co/paisonline/notas/Agosto072006/cali3.html |newspaper=El País |title=Cali recuerda la explosión del 7 de agosto |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927015128/http://www.elpais.com.co/paisonline/notas/Agosto072006/cali3.html |archive-date=27 September 2007}}</ref> The nearby army barracks was instantly destroyed.

In 1971, Santiago de Cali hosted the [[Pan American Games]], an event which is considered by many as the height of the city's golden age as a model of civic orderliness: following it, Cali was named the Sports Capital of Colombia. In 1982, the government of Cali inaugurated what is now the city's largest building and the third-largest in the Republic of Colombia—"La Torre de Cali", or The Cali Tower. It stands 42 stories tall and houses a hotel, offices and apartment complexes.

Cali became a focus center of the [[2021 Colombian protests]], which started on 28 April 2021. While most demonstrations held in the city were peaceful, there was also strong rioting, looting, and clashes between protesters and police officers.

==Geography==

Cali is located on the Cauca Valley to the west of the [[Cauca River]] and to the east of the Western Mountain Range near the hills known as [[Farallones de Cali]]. The city rests approximately {{convert|1000|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Approximately {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} west of Cali and over the Western Cordillera, lies the port city of [[Buenaventura, Colombia|Buenaventura]] on the Colombian Pacific coast. To the northeast are the manufacturing center of Yumbo and Cali's international airport, the [[Alfonso Bonilla Aragón International Airport|Alfonso Bonilla Aragón]] (CLO). It is Colombia's third-largest airport in terms of passengers, transporting 2,667,526 in 2009.

[[File:Los Farallones.jpg|thumb|center|700px|Panoramic [[Farallones de Cali]]]]
Santiago de Cali is located in a valley. The city is completely bordered by mountains to the West; the [[Farallones de Cali]] mountains are the closest to the city. The Eastern part of the city is bordered by the Cauca River. To the north and south are extended plains. In the first one you can find the industrial city of [[Yumbo]] which is part of Cali's metropolitan area, to the south you can find [[Jamundí]], also part of the metropolitan area. The city is mainly flat, but there are areas mostly to the west that are mountainous, like San Antonio and La loma de la Cruz, which are both tourist sites. There are several rivers that descend from the Western Mountain Range and empty into the Cauca River, passing through the metropolitan area of Cali. In the western part of the city the Aguacatal River flows into the [[Cali River]], which continues on to the [[Cauca River]]. In the south the rivers Cañaveralejo, Lilí, and Meléndez flow into the [https://www.cvc.gov.co/ CVC] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508191738/https://www.cvc.gov.co/ |date=8 May 2019 }} south channel which also empties into the Cauca River. Farther south, the banks of the [[Pance River]] are a popular place for recreation and leisure.

[[File:Guaiacum officinale- Cali, Colombia.jpg|thumb|[[Guaiacum officinale]] tree flowered in Cali.]]
Under [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen's climate classification]], Cali features a dry-summer [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: Am), bordering a [[tropical savanna climate]] (Köppen: As). The Western Mountain Range rises from an average of {{convert|2000|m|0|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] in the northern part of the city to approximately {{convert|4000|m|0|abbr=on}} to the south. Because of this variation in altitude, the weather in the northwest portion of the city is drier than in the southwest. The average annual precipitation varies between {{convert|900|and|1800|mm|0|abbr=on}} depending on the metropolitan zone for a citywide average of approximately {{convert|1483|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Even though there is enough rainfall to make for lush surroundings, Cali is still in a strong [[rain shadow]]. Its closest seaport of [[Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca#Climate|Buenaventura]] about {{convert|80|km|mi}} away<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.distance.to/Cali,Valle-del-Cauca,COL/3.884781467720501,-77.0855712890625|title=Distance between Cali, Valle del Cauca, COL → 3.88°N, 76.51°W|publisher=Distance.to|accessdate=6 July 2023|archive-date=6 July 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230706020701/https://www.distance.to/Cali,Valle-del-Cauca,COL/3.884781467720501,-77.0855712890625|url-status=live}}</ref> is among the rainiest locations in the world. This is due to Buenaventura being on the windward side of the coastal mountains that in return shield Cali from the Pacific monsoons. Cali's average temperature is {{convert|24|°C|0|abbr=on}} with an average low temperature of {{convert|17.4|°C|0|abbr=on}} and a high of {{convert|30.5|°C|0|abbr=on}}.

Owing to its proximity to the [[equator]], there are no major seasonal variations in Cali like winter, spring, summer and fall. However, locals refer to the dry season as the city's "summer", in which temperatures can rise to {{convert|30|to|34|°C|°F|}} and go down to {{convert|15|to|17|°C|°F}} at night. During the rainy season (or "winter") temperatures can rise to {{convert|28|to|30|°C|°F}} and go down to {{convert|18|to|20|°C|°F}} at night. There are typically two rainy seasons: from March to May and from October to November. However, rain can be expected to fall at any point during the year, nourishing the city's permanent green and lush vegetation. The highest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|36.5|°C|0|abbr=on}} in July 1997, and the lowest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|13.4|°C|0|abbr=on}} in August 1979.<ref name=IDEAM2/>

===Medical tourism===
According to recent [[Lonely Planet]]<ref>{{cite web |author=Krzysztof Dydynski |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/colombia/southwest-colombia/cali |title=Cali Travel Information and Travel Guide – Colombia |publisher=Lonely Planet |access-date=24 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325093833/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/colombia/southwest-colombia/cali |archive-date=25 March 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> guides of Colombia, Cali has recently become famous for being a prime destination for people seeking cheap cosmetic surgery and aesthetician centers. The city is very well known as The Capital of the Plastic Surgeries. There have been no significant reports of problems in this area, but Lonely Planet advises proper research before pursuing such an idea. About 50,000 cosmetic surgery procedures occurred in Cali in 2010, of which around 14,000 involved patients from abroad.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-7754931 |language=es |publisher=El Tiempo |title=Cali, destino mundial para turismo de salud y cirugías estéticas |date=14 June 2010 |access-date=31 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612105352/http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-7754931 |archive-date=12 June 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Transport==

===Airports===
Santiago de Cali is served by [[Alfonso Bonilla Aragón International Airport]] {{Airport codes|CLO|SKCL}}, located in the City of Palmira. It is Colombia's third largest airport in terms of passengers (transporting 3,422,919 in 2010) and fourth in cargo. Alfonso Bonilla Aragón is located in a long, narrow valley that runs from north to south, and is surrounded by mountains up to {{convert|14000|ft|m}} high. The airport is connected to the city by a highway known as the "recta a Palmira", that in the last few years has been upgraded to make the airport more accessible to Cali and the surrounding city centers in the region. The airport has also been remodeled recently; some of the last significant events in those terms were the inauguration of the VIP room in the National terminal and the installation of a main electronic screen in the center of the check-in area.

The [[Marco Fidel Suárez Air Base]] is a military airport close to the city's downtown. It is located in the east side of the city and belongs to the [[Colombian Air Force]]. It is used as one of the main training centers for the country's [[fighter pilot]]s.

===Public transport===
[[File:MIO CALI COLOMBIA.JPG|thumb|Masivo Integrado de Occidente (MIO)]]

The city of Cali offers a variety of ways to move through the city; in March 2009, The Masivo Integrado de Occidente (MIO) began operations. It is planned to be the primary system that connects the city. Taxis and old buses are the secondary way to get around. Taxis are one of the best systems that tourists can use, as they are relatively inexpensive and are more secure. Non-MIO buses round out the system and are used primarily by the working class to get around and are less expensive to use. Buses are secure but not at the same level as taxis. This part of the transport in the city is awaiting a needed reorganization of routes.

[[Masivo Integrado de Occidente]] (MIO): It is a [[bus rapid transit]] system of articulated buses that run on dedicated bus lanes in the middle of major thoroughfares, with stations connected to sidewalks by dedicated pedestrian crossings or bridges. The system layout is {{convert|243|km|0|abbr=off}} distributed in trunk, pre-trunk and complementary corridors. The system also integrated the renovation and recuperation of the public space. The MIO system was not only designed for the public transport, but built for public use with extensive new sidewalks, parks, gardens and public squares for the public to enjoy.

The system also includes a [[Aerial lift|cable car]] line named MÍO Cable, which is fully integrated with the MIO network and directly serves the residents of the Siloé district.

List of the Trunk or principal corridors:

Depending on the company and the destination, the vehicles range from [[minibus]]es to large [[Coach (vehicle)|coaches]]. Recently, in their last float renovation wave, Colombian coaches operators have opted for Brazil's [[Marcopolo S.A.|Marcopolo]] buses. Informal stops exist for the short destination rides all along the way from Central Station to the town of destination. In some cases, it is enough for a passenger to ask to get off the bus for the bus to stop.

===Public transportation statistics===
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Cali, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 88 min. 23% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 21 min, while 43% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day.

==Economy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2020}}
Cali and Valle del Cauca constitute the third largest center national and international economic exchange in Colombia. The city is an important stop on way to Ecuador, and is connected with the world through the seaport of Buenaventura.
[[File:Jose Serrano modificado Cali edificio Banco de Occidente.jpg|thumb|left|Building of Banco de Occidente.]]

===Economic history===
The economic transformation of Cali and the Valle del Cauca during the twentieth century and its crisis of the century, and the outlook to the new century have been the subject of deep analysis of financial and academic institutions. This section is based on the analysis and recommendations of the report'' Cali Colombia – Toward a City Development and Strategy'' published by the [[World Bank]] in 2002, and the Regional Economic Situation Reports (ICER) published quarterly by the [[Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística|DANE]].

In the early twentieth century the city's economy was concentrated in the production of sugar, based on an agricultural model in which large tracts of land were cultivated with minimum use of labor. As a result, a few families owned vast areas of land in one of the most fertile regions of the country. This was an important factor in determining the power relations and the organization of the city through the twentieth century.

In the period 1910–1930, the city's economy shifted its focus from an agricultural model to become a commercial node at the national level through the development of basic infrastructure such as construction of the railway to Buenaventura and the creation of the department of [[Valle del Cauca]] with Cali designated as its capital.

Although the industrial vallecaucana revolution of Cali did not begin until the third decade of the twentieth century, some companies had already begun to build the industrial development of the region, as the printing company Carvajal y Cia (which began operations in 1904). In 1929 there is the creation of Soap Varela Hermanos, in the 1930s other industries begin to grow as large scale factories of [[Fuel gas|gas]] and beer, printing and cigarettes. Smaller companies also appeared focusing on [[Textiles|textile clothing]], [[Chemical industry|chemicals]], chocolates, [[building materials]], leather articles and furniture.

In 1940, Cali had already ceased to be a single point of trade and its economy was focused on industry. A few years before the decade began a major investment of foreign capital led to the establishment of many factories and local business grew to multinational corporations; as Croydon in 1937, Cementos del Valle in 1939, and Carton Colombia in 1941; [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] and [[Colgate-Palmolive]] came from the US in 1941. Later came other corporations like General CEAT (Centelsa) in 1955, and pharmaceutical laboratories were based in the Cauca Valley between 1940 and 1960, as Tecnoquímicas and Baxter.

The flourishing industrial city attracted waves of immigration in the 1950s and 1960s. In these decades there were important partnerships between the public and private sectors, as productive sector support to programs of business administration at the [[University of Valle]]. The growth of the university training professionals and technologists, as well as infrastructure development, were crucial for the further development of industry and trade in the Valle del Cauca. This trend continued in the 1970s and early years of the next decade. Public investment in infrastructure reached significant levels benefiting not only the production sector but also the growing population, this made Cali and Valle del Cauca models further development across the country.

In 1998, when the economic crisis became apparent, the national government could not respond to the call of the local politicians and mayors had to introduce austerity measures under pressure from [[creditor]]s, which caused the vallecaucano development model to collapse. Additionally, the tightening of the country's internal conflict required a tax increase aimed at national war spending, leaving less room for local governments to collect, through taxes, the money required for their development plans.

===Current statistics===
{{Update|section|date=July 2022}}

According to statistics by [[Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística|DANE]], in 1995 the annual growth of GDP of the Valle del Cauca region was almost twice the national rate. For 1997, GDP increased marginally, with the region itself going up 1%. In 1999 the country's economic recession was felt through a depression that made the economy contract, showing GDP growth of 4%. Since then GDP has grown in the valley with ups and downs, but its percentage share nationwide has been falling since 1995 as shown in the graph.

The department contributes significantly to the national economy. According to statistics for the year 2005, for agriculture the valley contributes 5.37% of the national production, which is relatively low compared with [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] (15.48%) or [[Cundinamarca department|Cundinamarca]] (12.81%). In fisheries products, the region ranks first, with the region contributing 36% of the country's total production. As for mining, the valley is not a metal-producing region; however, in terms of non-metallic minerals, the department contributes 8.15% of the total [[value added]] across Colombia.

The regional [[Industrial sector|industries]] contribute 13.81% of the national value-added tax, second only to Bogotá with 25.39% and 18.20% in Antioquia. Particularly, the industries of food, beverages, and snuff are important products in the valley's economy, contributing 16% of the national value added, equaled or surpassed only by Antioquia and Bogotá. On trade, nationally Bogotá has 32.22%, Antioquia 13.25%, and Valle 11.34%. In the valley transportation services provide 12.52% of value added.

The Consumer Price Index ([[Consumer price index|IPC]]) of Cali has been since the last decade one of the lowest among Colombian cities. About 78% of Cali's people are of working age (over 18 years). In 2005, for the first time in six years, the city had an occupancy rate above 60%, which confirms the good state of the economy, led primarily by growth in manufacturing, agriculture, and trade, among others.

Drogas La Rebaja, one of Colombia's largest pharmacy store chains, is based in Cali.So is candy company [[Colombina (candy brand)|Colombina]]. A bank, Banco de Occidente, a Grupo Aval company, has its head office in Cali.

==Politics==
[[File:Consejo de cali.JPG|thumb|Concejo de Cali (City council).]]

Cali is governed by a mayor, elected to a four-year term. Several administrative departments and secretaries report to the mayor. [[Elecciones regionales en Colombia|Mayoral elections]] started in 1986, followed by elections for governors in 1992. Previously, all Colombian regional executive-branch leaders were appointed by the [[President of Colombia]]. The first elected mayor was [[Carlos Holmes Trujillo]] of the Liberal Party. Unlike other Colombian cities, Cali has not properly adapted to the new mayoral election system{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}. The city has experienced unsuccessful terms under some of its elected mayors, two of which ended up being removed from office.

The City Council is composed of 21 members, elected by citywide circumscription for four-year terms. There is no relation between the number of City Counselors and the number of 'comunas' of the city, which is a merely administrative division created to facilitate the city's management.

Cali has some decentralized agencies; the most important being:

==Education==
A large part of the population relies on the public educational system, which is underfunded and in some cases improperly managed. Schools are under municipal or departmental management, the former being the most common. The Municipal Secretary of Education manages a large part of the city's budget, which has brought some politicians to try to control it as their personal organization.

The city is endowed with the most sophisticated and high-quality secondary education institutions and universities in the region. Most universities are located in the south part of the city. Among the most prestigious are [[University of Valle]] (Public), [[Pontificia Universidad Javeriana]] (Private), and [[Universidad Icesi]] (Private).
