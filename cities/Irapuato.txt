'''Irapuato''' is a Mexican city and [[municipalities of Mexico|municipality]] located at the foot of the Arandas Hill (in [[Spanish Language|Spanish]]: ''Cerro de Arandas''), in the central region of the [[Mexican state|state]] of [[Guanajuato]]. It lies between the Silao River and the [[Guanajuato River]], a tributary of the [[Lerma River]], at {{cvt|1,724|m|ft}} above [[sea level]]. It is located at {{Coord|20|40|N|101|21|W|}}. The city is the second-largest in the state (only behind [[León, Guanajuato|León]]), with a population of 342,561 according to the 2005 census, while its [[municipalities of Mexico|municipality]] has a population of 529,440.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ |title=2005 Census |work=INEGI: Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografía e Informática |access-date=2007-03-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328224939/http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ |archive-date=2007-03-28 }}</ref> The municipality has an area of {{cvt|851|km2|sqmi}} and includes numerous smaller outlying communities. Although it is now an important center for regional trade and transportation center as well the site of several automotive and chemical manufacturing plants, the city's main industry has historically been [[agriculture]] and it has long been known for its [[strawberries]] and industry of refried beans, also the raising of [[pig]]s and [[cattle]]. The [[fruits]] and [[flowers]] of Irapuato's luxurious gardens are well known throughout Mexico.

==History==

===Prehispanic era===
In the pre-Hispanic era, the site was inhabited by the [[Chichimecas]] (c. 1200 AD), a group of semi-nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]]s. Later on, the [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]]s conquered the region and initiated the establishment of a permanent settlement. They constructed buildings in the Purépecha architectural style, produced pottery, and practiced [[agriculture]]. They called the settlement Xiriquitzio (or Iriquitzio), which the Spanish conquerors pronounced "Jiricuato" (or Jiricuicho), which meant "the place with houses (or low dwellings)".<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.irapuato.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_staticxt&Itemid=30&xt_item=1&staticfile=irapuato/historia/prehispanica.htm | title=Irapuato History | work=irapuato.gob.mx | access-date=2007-03-20}}</ref> The initial growth period, however, was short-lived. The downfall of the [[Purépecha Empire]] led to the abandonment of the settlement, at which point it was once again inhabited by the Chichimecas.

===Conquest===
In the 16th century, vasts amounts of [[silver]] [[ore]] were discovered at the present day site of the capital city of [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]]. This discovery led to a massive migration of [[Spanish immigration to Mexico|Spanish settlers]] to the area.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.irapuato.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_staticxt&Itemid=30&xt_item=1&staticfile=irapuato/historia/conquista.htm | title=Historia de la Conquista | work=irapuato.gob.mx | access-date=2007-03-20}}</ref>

===Flood===
On 18 August 1973, thousands of homes were destroyed and an estimated 200 or 300 people killed when a dam burst, sending a {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on|spell=in}} high wall of water crashing into the city.<ref>[https://www.britishpathe.com/video/VLVAATORNXT4GAGQ0ILVMT5QXJ960-MEXICO-200-FEARED-DEAD-IN-DEVASTATED-FLOOD-TOWN-OF-IRAPUATO/query/FEARED 200 feared dead]</ref><ref>[https://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/broadcasts/472200 300 feared dead]</ref> Many people were left stranded on roofs and high places for days before they were rescued. 

===Massacres===
[[Irapuato massacres| Mass shootings]] occurred <ref>{{cite web |title=The killing of 26 people at a drug rehab center in Mexico thought to be part of a gang war  |date=2020-07-03 |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230417050430/https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-07-02/massacre-at-drug-rehab-center-dramatizes-escalating-violence-in-mexicos-guanajuato-state |archive-date=2023-04-17 |url-status=live |url=https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-07-02/massacre-at-drug-rehab-center-dramatizes-escalating-violence-in-mexicos-guanajuato-state}}</ref> at [[drug rehabilitation]] centers on 6 June and 1 July 2020.
