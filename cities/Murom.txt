It borders [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast]] and is situated {{convert|137|km}} from the administrative center [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]]. Its population as of the [[2021 Russian census|2021 Census]] was 107,497.

==History==
In the 9th century AD, the city marked the easternmost settlement of the [[East Slavs]] in the land of the Finnic [[Volga Finns|Muromians]]. The ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' mentions it as early as AD 862.<ref name="pchron">{{cite book | url=http://www.mgh-bibliothek.de/dokumente/a/a011458.pdf | title=The Russian Primary Chronicle: Laurentian Text | publisher=Medieval Academy of America, Cambridge, MA. |author1=Hazzard Cross |author2=Samuel and Sherbowitz-Wetzor |author3=Olgerd P. | year=1953 | pages=59–60}}</ref> It is, thus, one of the oldest cities in Russia. Circa 900&nbsp;AD, it was an important trading post from [[Volga Bulgaria]] to the [[Baltic Sea]].

Between AD 1010 and AD 1393, it was the capital of a separate principality, whose rulers included Saint [[Boris and Gleb|Gleb]], assassinated in AD 1015 and canonized in AD 1071, Saint Prince [[Konstantin of Murom|Konstantin the Blessed]], and [[Saints Peter and Fevronia of Murom]], subjects of an [[opera]] by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]. It was believed to be the home town of the most celebrated East Slavic [[epic poetry|epic]] hero, [[Ilya Muromets]]. The town has a statue which shows Ilya holding the hilt of his sword in the left hand and a cross in the right.

On June 30, 1961, Murom was the site of a spontaneous protest and riot against the police and Soviet authorities, following the death in police custody of a senior factory foreman named Kostikov.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mass uprisings in the USSR: protest and rebellion in the post-Stalin years |first1=Vladimir A. |last1=Kozlov |first2=Elaine |last2=McClarnand MacKinnon |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=s1kQQgCMHPIC&q=101+kilometer+law+Soviet&pg=PA193 |isbn=9780765606686 |year=2002 |publisher=M.E.

Murom still retains many marks of antiquity. The Savior [[monastery]], one of the most ancient in Russia, was first chronicled in 1096, when [[Oleg I of Chernigov|Oleg of Chernigov]] besieged it and killed [[Vladimir II Monomakh|Vladimir Monomakh]]'s son Izyaslav, who is buried there. In 1552, the monastery was visited by [[Ivan the Terrible]] who commissioned a stone cathedral, which was followed by other churches.

The Trinity convent, where the relics of Sts.&nbsp;Peter and Fevronia are displayed, features a fine cathedral (1642–1643), Kazan church (1652), a bell-tower (1652), a wooden church of St.&nbsp;Sergius, and stone walls. It is rivaled by the Annunciation Monastery, founded in the reign of [[Ivan the Terrible]] to house the relics of local princes and containing a cathedral from 1664. Two last-mentioned cathedrals, being probably the works of the same masters, have much in common with the Resurrection Church (1658) in the downtown. Quite different is the tent-like church of Sts. Cosmas and Damian, built in 1565 on the bank of the Oka to commemorate the Russian [[conquest of Kazan]].
