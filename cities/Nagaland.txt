'''Nagaland''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɑː|ɡ|ə|l|æ|n|d}}) is a [[States and union territories of India|state]] in the [[northeast India|north-eastern region]] of [[India]]. It is bordered by the Indian states of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] to the north, [[Assam]] to the west, [[Manipur]] to the south, and the [[Naga Self-Administered Zone]] of the [[Sagaing Region]] of [[Myanmar|Myanmar (Burma)]] to the east. Its capital city is [[Kohima]] and its largest city is the twin [[Chümoukedima]]–[[Dimapur]]. The state has an area of {{convert|16,579|km2}} with a population of 1,980,602 as per the [[2011 Census of India]], making it one of the least populated states in India.<ref name=coiprov>[http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/paper2/data_files/nagaland/8-fig_naga-9.pdf Census of India 2011] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207011822/http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/paper2/data_files/nagaland/8-fig_naga-9.pdf |date=7 February 2013 }} Govt of India</ref>

Nagaland consists of 16 administrative districts, inhabited by 17 major tribes along with other sub-tribes. Each tribe is distinct in character from the other in terms of customs, language and dress. It is a land of [[folklore]] passed down the generations through word of mouth. The earliest recorded history of the Nagas of the present-day Nagaland dates back to the 13th century.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nagaland Profile {{!}} Nagaland State Portal |url=https://nagaland.gov.in/pages/nagaland-profile#:~:text=The%20State%20of%20Nagaland%20was,State%20of%20the%20Indian%20Union. |access-date=9 October 2023 |website=nagaland.gov.in |archive-date=30 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231030144104/https://nagaland.gov.in/pages/nagaland-profile#:~:text=The%20State%20of%20Nagaland%20was,State%20of%20the%20Indian%20Union. |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the 19th century, the [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]] forces began expanding their influence in [[Northeast India]], including the [[Naga Hills]]. After India's independence in 1947, the question of the Naga Hills' political status emerged. Nagaland was a district in the [[Assam|State of Assam]] until 1957, known to others as "The Naga Hills". The [[Naga National Council]], led by [[Zapu Phizo]], demanded an independent Naga state and launched an armed insurgency. The [[Indian Government]], however, maintained that Nagaland was an integral part of the Indian Union. The conflict between the Naga National Council and the Indian Government resulted in a protracted [[Naga nationalism|insurgency]]. The State of Nagaland was formally inaugurated on 1 December 1963, as the 16th state of the Indian Union, and a [[Democracy|democratically]] elected government took office in 1964.

Nagaland is home to a rich variety of natural, cultural, and environmental resources. It is a mountainous state and lies between the parallels of 95° and 94° eastern longitude and 25.2° and 27.0° latitude north. The high-profile [[Dzüko Valley]] is at [[Viswema]], in the southern region of the state. The state has significant resources of natural minerals, petroleum, and hydropower, with the [[primary sector]] which is mostly agriculture still accounting for 24.6% of its economy.<ref name="N1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibef.org/states/nagaland-infographic|title=Economic Growth in Nagaland: IBEF Infographics|date=January 2024|website=www.ibef.org|language=en-in|access-date=25 April 2024}}</ref> Other significant activities include [[forestry]], tourism, insurance, real estate, horticulture, and miscellaneous [[Cottage industry|cottage industries]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ibef.org/states/nagaland|title=Nagaland's petroleum reserves stood at 2.38 million tons in 2021|access-date=28 August 2022|website=[[India Brand Equity Foundation]]|archive-date=28 August 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220828054701/https://www.ibef.org/states/nagaland|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=cc1>Charles Chasie (2005), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23006032 Nagaland in Transition] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501143009/http://www.jstor.org/stable/23006032 |date=1 May 2016 }}, ''India International Centre Quarterly'', Vol. 32, No. 2/3, Where the Sun Rises When Shadows Fall: The North-east (Monsoon-Winter 2005), pp. 253-264</ref><ref name=cc2>Charles Chasie, [http://www.ide.go.jp/English/Publish/Download/Jrp/pdf/133_9.pdf Nagaland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219065555/http://www.ide.go.jp/English/Publish/Download/Jrp/pdf/133_9.pdf |date=19 February 2014 }}, Institute of Developing Economies (2008)</ref>

==Etymology==
The origin of the word 'Naga' is unclear.<ref name=undp/> The present day Naga people have historically been referred to by many names, like "Noga" or "Naka" by the inhabitants of the [[Ahom kingdom]] in what is now considered as [[Assam]] which means "naked",<ref>{{cite book |last1=Grierson |title=Linguistic Survey of India Vol iii part ii |page=194}}</ref> "Hao" by [[Meitei people]] of [[Imphal Valley]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hodson |first1=TC |title=The Naga tribes of Manipur |date=1911 |page=9}}</ref> and "Nakas" or 'Naga' by [[Bamar people|Burmese]] of what is now considered as [[Myanmar]]<ref>{{cite book |title=Upper Chindwin District vol A |publisher=Burma Gazetteer |page=22}}</ref><ref name="Burmese sounds">{{cite book|title = Myanmar (Burma)|author=Robert Reid, Michael Grosberg|publisher = Lonely Planet|year = 2005|page= 380}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=SEMA|first=HOKISHE|title=EMERGENCE OF NAGALAND: Socio-Economic and Political Transformation and the Future|publisher=VIVEK PUBLISHING HOUSE PVT LTD, DELHI|year=1986|isbn=0-7069-3031-2|location=INDIA|pages=3}}</ref> meaning "people with earrings", while others suggest it means pierced noses.<ref name="Inato_cultural">{{cite book|title = A re-discovery and re-building of Naga cultural values|author = Inato Yekheto Shikhu|publisher = Daya Books|year = 2007|isbn = 978-81-89233-55-6|page = 4}}</ref>

Before the arrival of [[European colonialism]] in South Asia, there had been many wars, [[persecution]] and raids from [[Burma]] on the Nagas, [[Meitei people|Meitei]]s and others in India's northeast. The invaders came for "[[Headhunting|head hunting]]" and to seek [[wealth]] and [[Slavery|captives]] from these [[tribe]]s and [[ethnic group]]s. When the [[British Raj|British]] inquired with Burmese guides about the people living in the northern Himalayas, they were told 'Naka'. This was recorded as 'Naga' and has been in use thereafter.<ref name=cc2/><ref name=undp/>

== History ==
{{main|History of the Nagas}}
{{See also|Naga people}}The ancient history of the Nagas is unclear. Ethnic groups migrated at different times, each settling in the northeastern part of present India and establishing their respective sovereign mountain terrains and village states. There are no records of whether they came from the northern Mongolian region, southeast Asia, or southwest China, except that their origins are from the east of India, and historical records show the present-day [[Naga people]] settled before the arrival of the [[Ahom kingdom|Ahoms]] in 1228 CE.<ref name=cc1/><ref name=undp/>

With the arrival of the [[British East India Company]] in the early 19th century, followed by the [[British Raj]], Britain expanded its domain over the whole of [[South Asia]], including the [[Naga Hills District, British India|Naga Hills]]. The first [[Europeans]] to enter the hills were Captain [[Francis Jenkins (East India Company officer)|Francis Jenkins]] and Lieutenant [[Robert Pemberton]] in 1832. The early contact with the Naga ethnic groups was characterised by suspicion and [[Conflict (process)|conflict]]. The [[British colonialism|colonial]] interests in Assam, such as managers of [[tea estates]] and other trading posts led defensive action against raids from the ethnic groups who were known for their bravery and "[[Headhunting|head hunting]]" practices. To put an end to these raids, the [[British troops]] recorded 10 [[Expeditionary warfare|military expeditions]] between 1839 and 1850.<ref name=undp/> In February 1851, at the bloody [[Battle of Kikrüma]], people died on both the British side and the Kikrüma (Naga) side; in the days after the battle, inter-ethnic warfare followed that led to more bloodshed. After that war, the British adopted a policy of caution and non-interference with Naga ethnic groups.<ref name="TOI">{{cite news|last=Kalita|first=Jayanta|date=12 August 2022|title=How India's North East rebelled against the British|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-indias-northeast-rebelled-against-the-british/articleshow/93479614.cms|newspaper=Times of India|access-date=16 August 2022|archive-date=15 August 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220815181418/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-indias-northeast-rebelled-against-the-british/articleshow/93479614.cms|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Reddy">{{cite book|author=G.

Despite this, [[British colonialism|colonists]] continued to move into Naga peoples' territory. Between 1851 and 1865, Naga ethnic groups continued to raid the British in Assam. The British India Government took over the holdings of the East Indian Company following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. The failings and [[Atrocity crime|atrocities]] of the [[East India Company|East Indian Company]] led the British Crown to review its governance structure throughout [[South Asia]] including its northeastern region. In 1866, the British India administration established a post at Samaguting with the explicit goal of ending intertribal warfare and tribal raids on property and personnel.<ref name=cc1/><ref name=cc2/>

In 1869, Captain Butler was appointed to lead and consolidate the British presence in the Nagaland Hills. In 1878, the headquarters were transferred to Kohima — creating a city that remains an important center of administration, commerce, and culture for Nagaland.<ref name=undp/>

On 4 October 1879, British political agent G. H. Damant went to [[Khonoma]] with troops, where he was shot dead with 35 of his team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/india-tour/nagaland/khonoma-a-naga-village-remembered/|title=Maps of India website – photograph of GH Damant grave headstone|access-date=1 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101044027/http://www.mapsofindia.com/india-tour/nagaland/khonoma-a-naga-village-remembered/|archive-date=1 November 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Kohima was subsequently attacked and the stockade looted. This violence led to a determined effort by the British Raj to return and respond. The subsequent defeat of Khonoma marked the end of serious and persistent ultimatums in the Naga Hills.<ref name=undp/>

Between 1880 and 1922, the British administration consolidated their position over a large area of the Naga Hills and integrated it into its Assam operations. The British administration enforced the [[rupee]] as the currency for economic activity and a system of structured ethnic government that was very different from historic social governance practices.<ref name=cc1/>

In parallel, since the mid-19th century, [[Christian mission]]aries from the [[United States]] and [[Europe]], stationed in India,<ref name="autogenerated1974">Gordon Pruett, Christianity, history, and culture in Nagaland, ''Indian Sociology'' January 1974 vol. 8 no. 1, pp. 51-65</ref> reached into Nagaland and neighbouring states, converting Nagaland's Naga ethnic groups from [[animism]] to Christianity.<ref name=cc1/><ref>Tezenlo Thong, "'Thy Kingdom Come': The Impact of Colonization and Proselytization on Religion among the Nagas," ''Journal of Asian and African Studies'', no. 45, 6: 595–609</ref>

In 1944, during [[World War II]], the Japanese Army, with the help of the [[Indian National Army]] led by [[Netaji Subhashchandra Bose]], invaded through Burma and attempted to take India through Kohima. The population was evacuated. [[British Indian Army|British India]] soldiers [[Battle of Kohima|defended the area of Kohima]] and having lost many of their original force were relieved by British in June 1944.
Together the British and Indian troops successfully repelled the Japanese troops.<ref>Bert Sim, Mosstodloch, Aberdeenshire, Scotland: Pipe Major of the Gordon Highlanders at Kohima: his home is named "Kohima." – RJWilliams, Slingerlands, NY/USA</ref>

There is the [[World War II]] Cemetery, and the War Museum, in honour of those who died during World War II during the fighting between the British Empire and Japanese troops. Nearly 4,000 British Empire troops died, along with 3,000 Japanese. Many of those who died were Naga people, particularly the Angami Nagas. Near the memorial is the [[Mary Help of Christians Cathedral, Kohima|Kohima Cathedral]], on [[Aradura Hill]], built with funds from the families and friends of deceased Japanese soldiers. Prayers are held in Kohima for peace and in memory of the fallen of both sides of the battle.<ref>[http://kunzum.com/2010/01/19/the-world-war-ii-cemetery-in-kohima-nagaland-a-moving-experience/ The World War II Cemetery in Kohima, Nagaland: A Moving Experience] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129043153/http://kunzum.com/2010/01/19/the-world-war-ii-cemetery-in-kohima-nagaland-a-moving-experience/ |date=29 November 2014 }} Kunzum, Ajay Jain (2010)</ref><ref>Vibha Joshi, A Matter of Belief: Christian Conversion and Healing in North-East India; {{ISBN|978-0857455956}}, pg. 221.</ref>

=== Naga national awakening ===
<!-- During [[World War I]], the British recruited 900 Nagas and sent them to [[France]] to work as aides at the [[Front (military)|front]]. While in Europe, the Nagas, who had always been fractured by ethnic differences, began to unify under the banner of [[nationalism]].{{cn}} On their return to their homeland in 1918, they organised themselves in the light of oneness and political solution, and this eventually led to the formation of the [[Naga National Council|Naga Nationalist Movement]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.combatlaw.org/information.php?article_id=7&issue_id=1 |title=The Naga Story – Then and Now |access-date=14 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007115418/http://www.combatlaw.org/information.php?article_id=7&issue_id=1 |archive-date=7 October 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{Verify credibility|certain=y|reason=The website admits that the authors are activist; see [[WP:SOAP]] and [[WP:WWIN]]}} -->
In 1929, a memorandum was submitted to the [[Simon Commission|Simon Statutory Commission]], requesting that the Nagas be exempt from reforms and new taxes proposed in [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]], should be left alone to determine their own future.<ref>A.M. Toshi Jamir, 'A Handbook of General Knowledge on Nagaland' (2013, 10th Edition) pg. 10</ref>

The [[Naga Memorandum]] submitted by the [[Naga Club]] (which later became the [[Naga National Council]]) to the Simon Commission explicitly stated, 'to leave us alone to determine ourselves as in ancient times.'<ref name=sks>SK Sharma (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=_-YixIgJbSAC&pg=PA33 Naga Memorandum to the Simon Commission (1929)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729032016/https://books.google.com/books?id=_-YixIgJbSAC&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33 |date=29 July 2016 }}, Mittal Publications, New Delhi India</ref>

=== Post-independence history ===
After the [[Indian independence movement|independence of India]] in 1947, the area remained a part of the province of [[Assam Province|Assam]]. Nationalist activities arose among a section of the Nagas. [[Angami Zapu Phizo|Phizo]]-led [[Naga National Council]] demanded a political union of their ancestral and native groups. The movement led to [[Ethnic conflict in Nagaland|a series of violent incidents]], that damaged government and civil infrastructure, attacked government officials and civilians. The central government sent the [[Indian Army]] in 1955, to restore order. In 1957, an agreement was reached between Naga leaders and the Indian government, creating a single separate region of the [[Naga Hills]]. The Tuensang frontier was united with this single political region, Naga Hills Tuensang Area (NHTA),<ref name="Nagaland Legislative Assembly">{{cite news |title= Naga Hills Tuensang Area Act, 1957 |url= http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/727141/ |access-date= 11 November 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111658/http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/727141/ |archive-date= 24 December 2013 |url-status= live |df= dmy-all }}</ref> and it became an autonomous area under [[Sixth Schedule to the Constitution of India]].

This was not satisfactory to the Nagas, however, and agitation with violence increased across the state – including attacks on army and government institutions, banks, as well as non-payment of taxes. In July 1960, following discussion between [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] Nehru and the leaders of the Naga People Convention (NPC), a [[The 16-Point Agreement|16-point agreement]] was arrived at whereby the Government of India recognised the formation of Nagaland as a full-fledged state within the Union of India.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/nagaland/documents/papers/nagaland_16point.htm|title=The 16-point Agreement arrived at between the Government of India and the Naga People's Convention, July 1960|access-date=1 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150808003425/http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/nagaland/documents/papers/nagaland_16point.htm|archive-date=8 August 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Accordingly, the territory was placed under the Nagaland Transitional Provisions Regulation, 1961<ref>{{cite book | title = Documents on North-East India: Nagaland | author = Suresh K.

Subsequently, Nagaland attained statehood with the enactment of the state of Nagaland Act in 1962<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/1490539/|title=The State Of Nagaland Act, 1962|access-date=1 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101044253/http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/1490539/|archive-date=1 November 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> by the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]]. The interim body was dissolved on 30 November 1963 and the state of Nagaland was formally inaugurated on 1 December 1963 and [[Kohima]] was declared as the state capital.

The rebel activity continued in many Naga inhabited areas both in India and Burma. Ceasefires were announced and negotiations continued, but this did little to stop the violence. In March 1975, a direct presidential rule was imposed by the then Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] on the state. In November 1975, some leaders of the largest rebel groups agreed to lay down their arms and accept the [[Indian constitution]], a small group did not agree and continued their insurgent activity.<ref>Nagaland, Encyclopædia Britannica (2011)</ref> The [[Nagaland Baptist Church Council]] played an important role by initiating peace efforts in the 1960s.<ref name="undp" />

The relatively slow rate of urbanisation in Nagaland was described in the 1980s as being an effect of (a) the largely administrative roles of the towns, except for Dimapur which had a more diversified economy, and (b) a low level of mobility among the tribes of Nagaland, [[scheduled tribes]] constituting nearly 90% of the population.<ref name="Yadav"/>

== Economy ==
The Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) of Nagaland was about {{INRConvert|12065|c}} in 2011–12.<ref>[http://pbplanning.gov.in/pdf/Statewise%20GSDP%20PCI%20and%20G.R.pdf State wise : Population, GSDP, Per Capita Income and Growth Rate] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111062118/http://pbplanning.gov.in/pdf/Statewise%20GSDP%20PCI%20and%20G.R.pdf|date=11 November 2013}} Planning Commission, Govt of India; See third table 2011-2012 fiscal year, 19th row</ref> Nagaland's GSDP grew at 9.9% compounded annually for a decade, thus more than doubling the per capita income.<ref name=ibef>[http://www.ibef.org/pages/32467 Nagaland Economy Report, 2011-2012] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714191607/http://www.ibef.org/pages/32467 |date=14 July 2014 }} IBEF, India</ref>

Nagaland has a literacy rate of 80.1 per cent. The majority of the population in the state speaks [[English language|English]], which is the official language of the state. The state offers technical and medical education.<ref name=ibef/> Nevertheless, agriculture and forestry contribute a majority of Nagaland's Gross Domestic Product. The state is rich in mineral resources such as coal, limestone, iron, nickel, cobalt, chromium, and marble.<ref>Anowar Hussain, Economy of North Eastern Region of India, Vol.1, Issue XII / June 2012, pp.1-4</ref>

[[File:Terrace cultivation, Pfutsero, Nagaland (6328134243).jpg|thumb|Terrace farming at [[Pfütsero]]]]
Plantation crops such as premium coffee, cardamom, and tea are grown in hilly areas in small quantities with large growth potential. Most people cultivate rice as it is the main staple diet of the people. About 80% of the cropped area is dedicated to rice. Oilseeds is another, higher income crop gaining ground in Nagaland. The farm productivity for all crops is low, compared to other Indian states, suggesting a significant opportunity for farmer income increase. Currently, the Jhum to Terraced cultivation ratio is 4:3; where Jhum is the local name for cut-and-burn shift farming. Jhum farming is ancient, causes a lot of pollution and soil damage, yet accounts for the majority of the farmed area. The state does not produce enough food and depends on the trade of food from other states of India.<ref name=pn>Purusottam Nayak, [http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/51851/ Some Facts and Figures on Development Attainments in Nagaland] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630025310/http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/51851/ |date=30 June 2014 }}, Munich Personal RePEc Archive, MPRA Paper No. 51851, October 2013</ref>

Tourism has a lot of potentials but was largely limited due to insurgency and concern of [[Terrorism|terrorist]] violence over the last five decades. More recently, a number of Small Medium Enterprises and private sector companies have actively promoted Nagaland tourism, helping initiate a growing tourism market. Tourism experts contend that the state's uniqueness and strategic location in northeast India give Nagaland an advantage in tapping into the tourism sector for economic growth.<ref name="' A window to the northeast'">{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/A-window-to-the-North-East/article14626697.ece |title=A window to the northeast |newspaper=The Hindu |date=1 November 2016 |access-date=21 March 2017 |last1=Ghosh |first1=Saptaparno |archive-date=7 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210307234405/https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/A-window-to-the-North-East/article14626697.ece |url-status=live }}</ref>

The state generates 87.98 MU compared to a demand for 242.88 MU. This deficit requires Nagaland to buy power. The state has significant hydroelectric potential, which if realised could make the state a power surplus state. In terms of power distribution, every village and town, and almost every household has an electricity connection; but, this infrastructure is not effective given the power shortage in the state.<ref name=pn/>

=== Natural resources ===
After a gap of almost 20 years, Nagaland state Chief Minister, T. R. Zeliang launched the resumption of oil exploration in Changpang and Tsori areas, under Wokha District in July 2014. The exploration will be carried out by the Metropolitan Oil & Gas Pvt. Ltd. Zeliang has alleged failures and disputed payments made to the statement made by the previous explorer, the state-owned [[Oil and Natural Gas Corporation]] (ONGC).<ref>Oil exploration resumes in Nagaland, (21 July 2014) Accessed from http://www.morungexpress.com/frontpage/119064.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018180203/http://www.morungexpress.com/frontpage/119064.html |date=18 October 2014 }} on 18 October 2014</ref>

== Transportation ==
Nagaland's rugged and mountainous landscape presents a major challenge to the infrastructural development of transport. Roads are the backbone of Nagaland's transportation network. The state has over 15,000&nbsp;km of surfaced roads, but these are not satisfactorily maintained given the weather damage. Yet, in terms of population served for each kilometre of surfaced road, Nagaland is the second best state in the region after Arunachal Pradesh.<ref name=pn/>

====Feasts of Merit====
In Naga society, individuals were expected to find their place in the social hierarchy, and prestige was the key to maintaining or increasing social status. To achieve these goals a man, whatever his ascendancy, had to be a [[Headhunting|headhunter]] or great warrior, have many sexual conquests among women, or complete a series of merit feasts.<ref>Drouyer, A. Isabel, René Drouyer, THE NAGAS: MEMORIES OF HEADHUNTERS- Indo-Burmese Borderlands- Volume 1", White Lotus, 2016, p.168.</ref>

The Feasts of Merit reflected the splendor and celebration of Naga life.<ref name=cc1/> Only married men could give such Feasts, and his wife took a prominent and honoured place during the ritual which emphasised male-female co-operation and interdependence. His wife brewed the [[beer]] which he offered to the guests. The event displayed ceremonies and festivities organised by the sponsor. The Feast given by a wealthier community person would be more extravagant.<ref>C. R.

After filing the application in August 2007, the chilli was granted the GI tag in 2008 by the Geographical Indication Registry in [[Chennai]], making the name "Naga Mircha" exclusive to the chilies grown in the region. It thus became the first chilli variety from Nagaland and the first type of goods from Nagaland to earn the GI tag.<ref>{{cite news |title=The hottest chillies in the world! |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/the-hottest-chillies-in-the-world/story-klb2pfo3fPxM7AFlISMptM.html |access-date=29 October 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Nagaland gets patent rights for Naga King Chilli |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/nagaland-gets-patent-rights-for-naga-king-chilli/articleshow/61219132.cms |access-date=29 October 2024 |work=The Times of India |date=25 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Nagaland gets patent rights for Naga King Chilli |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/nagaland-gets-patent-rights-for-naga-king-chilli/articleshow/61219132.cms |access-date=29 October 2024 |work=The Times of India |date=25 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Many GI-tagged products hold potential to boost exports: Commerce Ministry - ET Retail |url=https://retail.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/food-entertainment/grocery/many-gi-tagged-products-hold-potential-to-boost-exports-commerce-ministry/90315767 |access-date=29 October 2024 |work=ETRetail.com |language=en}}</ref>
