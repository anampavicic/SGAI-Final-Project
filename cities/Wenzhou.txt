Wenzhou is located at the extreme southeast of Zhejiang, bordering [[Lishui, Zhejiang|Lishui]] to the west, [[Taizhou, Zhejiang|Taizhou]] to the north, and the province of [[Fujian]] to the south. The area consists of mostly mountainous terrain, as well as hundreds of islands off the [[East China Sea]] coast, which is nearly {{convert|355|km|0|abbr=off}} in length.

==History==
===Ancient history===
The area that would become Wenzhou has archeological artifacts tracing back to around 2500&nbsp;BC, when it became known for its [[Chinese ceramics|pottery]] production, and as one of the origins of [[celadon]] in ancient China. The Ouyue culture developed into the [[Kingdom of Dong'ou]], with a history dating back more than 2,200 years.<ref>http://www.ezhejiang.gov.cn/wenzhou/2024-04/09/c_654199.htm Wenzhou government website</ref> Due to its relatively isolated geography, the culture of Dong'ou tended in ancient times to often at first to develop according to local patterns.

===Imperial China===
In the early second century&nbsp;BC, shortly after the destruction of the [[Qin dynasty]], military and political leader Zou Yao ({{lang|zh-hans|驺摇}}) of Wenzhou helped Emperor [[Gaozu of Han]], the first emperor of the Han Dynasty, defeated the prominent warlord [[Xiang Yu]] of the Chu. After the victory, Gaozu's son [[Hui of Han|Hui]] named Zhou Yao as the king of the [[Dong'ou|Dong'ou kingdom]], with its new capital near present-day Wenzhou. This polity would last from 191&nbsp;BC until it was conquered by the [[Minyue|Minyue kingdom]] in 138&nbsp;BC.

Wenzhou's present name is due to the city's mild weather.

The city walls were built in the 10th century, and its seven gates were erected in 1598.<ref name="EB1911">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Wên-chow-fu|volume=28|page=518}}</ref>

===Modern era===
Throughout its history, Wenzhou's traditional economic role has been as a port giving access to the mountainous interior of southern [[Zhejiang]] Province. In early European sources, the name Wenzhou-[[fu (administrative division)|Fu]] or -Foo was often transcribed '''Ouen-tcheou-fou''' or '''Wen-tcheou''' after the accounts of French-speaking missionaries.<ref>E.g.: {{cite book

}}</ref> In 1876, Wenzhou opened for tea exports, which led to a significant [[Chinese diaspora in France|Wenzhounese diaspora]] of merchants in France, but no foreign settlement was ever established there.<ref name="EB1911"/> Between 1937 and 1942, during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (i.e., [[World War II]]), Wenzhou achieved importance as one of the few ports still under Chinese control. It declined in the later years of the war, but began to recover after coastal trade along the Zhejiang coast was re-established in 1955.

==Fengshui of Wenzhou==
Wenzhou is the only city in China designed by [[Guo Pu]] ({{lang|zh|郭璞}}), the father of the [[Fengshui]] philosophical system.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hokming.com/fengshuimaster-legendmaster-kksck.htm|script-title=zh:風水大師郭璞先生的寶典--葬經, 關鍵字「風水大師」「葬經」.風水, 風水口訣, 風水大師, 風水師、風水師傅、風水設計, 風水, 陰宅風水, 青囊奧語-揀風水樓-風水用品-風水布局-風水瑞獸-風水師-風水課程|website=hokming.com|language=zh-hant|access-date=1 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005113803/http://www.hokming.com/fengshuimaster-legendmaster-kksck.htm|archive-date=5 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> During the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]], [[Guo Pu]] organised Wenzhou on the basis of the [[Fengshui]] philosophical system along with the [[Twenty-Eight Mansions]], and the [[Wuxing (Chinese philosophy)|Five Elements]].

Throughout its history, Wenzhou has avoided numerous militant activities that were originally set out to invade the city of Wenzhou. However, none of them were successful, and this protection is concluded {{by whom|date=May 2023}} to be the result of the [[Fengshui]] development of the city. {{Citation needed|date=May 2023}} During the [[Northern Song Dynasty]], when the Fangla Revolution took place in the now [[Zhejiang]] province, the invading army surrounded Wenzhou for over 40 days, but the mountainous isolation blocked the army's movement and the army ended up retreating.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="blog.sina.com.cn"/><ref>http://www.hist.pku.edu.cn/person/dengxiaonan/tongshi_2/TD06/cankao/fangla.htm{{Dead link|date=January 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Wenzhou is still considered {{By whom|date=May 2023}} to possess the best [[Feng Shui]] conditions and nature of all the Chinese cities. Other cities considered to possess excellent Fengshui nature are [[Beijing]], [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture]], [[Kunming]], [[Hengyang]], and [[Shenzhen]]. However, none of these cities is designed entirely on the basis of philosophy of [[Fengshui]] or designed by the father of [[Fengshui]], [[Guo Pu]]. People from all over China usually refer to the accomplishments and influence of Wenzhounese as a result of Wenzhou's [[Fengshui]] development by Guo Pu. {{Unreferenced section|date=May 2023}}

===Guo Pu===
When Guo Pu climbed to the top of West Guo Mountain ({{lang|zh|西郭山}}) in Wenzhou, {{Clarify|date=May 2023}} he saw the range of mountains of Wenzhou shaped as a dipper and the city itself shaped as a key. Wenzhou is still nicknamed the "Dipper city" based on the popular geographical saying "mountains as dipper, city as key" ({{lang|zh-hans|山如北斗城似锁}}).<ref>{{cite web|script-title=zh:郭璞為溫州佈局|url=http://www.zxyfs.com/html/fsxz/1135.htm|publisher=zxyfs.com|language=zh-hant|access-date=29 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018202647/http://www.zxyfs.com/html/fsxz/1135.htm|archive-date=18 October 2014|url-status=live |title=NameBright - Domain Expired }}</ref> Legend has it that during the time when Wenzhou was being established and developed, a white deer was seen in the city with a flower in its mouth, therefore Wenzhou is also known as "Deer City" ({{zh|labels=no|c=鹿城 |p=Lùchéng}}).<ref name="EB1911"/> Today, the [[Lucheng District, Wenzhou|Lucheng District]] is the name of downtown Wenzhou and the White Deer theater located at downtown is the most popular theater among the locals .<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

[[Guo Pu]] is honoured today by the renaming of West Guo Mountain, where he stood to observe the city, into Guo Gong Mountain. At the bottom of Guo Gong Mountain, a temple was also built and named Guo Gong Temple. In 2003, the local government constructed a statue of Guo Pu in downtown Wenzhou.

==Geography==
[[File:Txu-oclc-10552568-nh51-13.jpg|left|thumb|Wenzhou (labelled as YUNG-CHIA (WENCHOW) {{lang|zh|永嘉}}) (1953)]]
[[File:Dayu Bay - Yandun Shan - P1210613.JPG|thumb|On the coast of the Dayu Bay in [[Cangnan County]]]]
With jurisdiction over four districts, two county-level cities and five counties, Wenzhou covers a land area of {{convert|11784|km2|abbr=on}} and sea area of {{convert|11000|km2|abbr=on}}. The population of the prefectural level city is 9.12 million including 2.30 million urban residents, divided among 3 county-level cities and 4 districts.

Most of Wenzhou's landscape is mountainous, with many mountain tops reaching altitudes in excess of {{convert|1000|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}, for example in the [[Yandangshan|Yandang Mountains]], a coastal mountain range dominating the eastern part of prefecture. Another dominating landscape element is the [[Ou River (Zhejiang)|Ou River]], the largest river in Wenzhou prefecture. There are some coastal plains, notably around the mouth of the Ou (where the city proper of Wenzhou is located), the [[Nanxi River (Zhejiang)|Nanxi River]], a tributary of the Ou, and further south, around the mouth of the [[Feiyun River]] (in [[Rui'an]], a county-level city). Coastal plains are used intensively for agriculture but also host much of the population and industry.

The {{convert|339|km}} long coastline gives the city abundant marine resources and has many islands.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} Dongtou, one of the districts in Wenzhou, has also been called the "County of One Hundred Islands." Dongtou County was renamed as Dongtou District in September 2015 following the State Council-sanctioned administrative region adjustments.

Wenzhou boasts wonderful landscapes with rugged mountains and tranquil waters, including three state-level scenic spots, namely the [[Yandangshan|Yandang Mountains]], the [[Nanxi River (Zhejiang)|Nanxi River]] and the Baizhangji Fall-Feiyun Lake, and two national nature reserves, the [[Wuyanling National Nature Reserve|Wuyanling Ridge]] and the [[Nanji Islands]]. Yandang Mountain has been named as a World [[Geopark]], while the Nanji Islands are listed a UNESCO Marine Nature Reserve of [[World Network of Biosphere Reserves|World Biosphere Reserves]]. Scenic areas account for 25% of the city's land space.

==Climate==
Wenzhou derives its present name from its climate, and has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa'') with short winters and long, hot, humid summers. Summers are similar to the remainder of the province (albeit slightly cooler during the daytime as compared to inland areas), but winter is much milder, partly due to the southerly location and partly due to the sheltering effect of the surrounding mountains. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from {{convert|8.7|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|28.7|°C|1}} in July and August, while the annual mean is {{convert|18.9|°C|1}}. Heavy rainfalls occur in late spring and early summer due to the [[plum rain]]s of the East Asian [[monsoon]], while [[typhoon]]s are commonly a threat in the second half of summer causing considerable damage and destruction. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 26% in March to 53% in August, the city receives 1,706 hours of bright sunshine annually.

==Economy==
[[File:Shopping street in Wenzhou.jpg|thumb|Wuma Shopping Street]]

{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2023}} Wenzhou exports food, [[tea]], [[wine]], [[jute]], [[timber]], [[paper]] and [[alunite]] (a non-metallic mineral used to make alum and fertilizer). Alunite is abundant and Wenzhou claims to be the "Alunite Capital of the World". Its 10 main industries each exceeding 1.5 billion dollars are electrical machinery, leather products, general equipment, power supply, plastic manufacturing, textile and garment, transport equipment, chemical products, metal products and metal processing.

From the 1990s, low-voltage electric appliances manufacturing became one of the major industries in Wenzhou, with some of the large private enterprises setting up joint ventures with [[GE]] and [[Schneider Electric|Schneider]].

In 1994, exploration for [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] commenced in the [[East China Sea]] {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} off the coast of Wenzhou. Companies such as [[Texaco]], [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and [[JAPEX]] have started to drill for oil but the operations have been largely unsuccessful.

Wenzhou is a city full of vibrant business activities. When China began [[economic reform in the People's Republic of China|economic reforms]] in 1978, Wenzhou was the first city in China to set up individual and [[private enterprises]] as well as shareholder cooperatives. It has also taken the lead in carrying out financial system reform and structural reform in townships. Being a pioneer in utilizing [[marketing]] mechanism to develop urban constructions, Wenzhou has won a number of firsts in China and set many national records.

From 1978 through 2016, the GDP of Wenzhou, a third-tier city in China, has increased from 1.32 billion RMB to 504.54 billion RMB with the gross fiscal revenue increasing from 0.135 billion RMB to 72.4 billion RMB, and the disposable net per capita income for rural residents increasing from 113.5 RMB to 22,985 RMB. The per capita disposable income for urban residents increased from 422.6 RMB in 1981 to 47,785 RMB in 2016, which is among the highest in China.

===Financial reform pilot project===
{{Update section|date=June 2024}}
In late March 2012, China's [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] announced that Wenzhou would be the site of a pilot project for the reform of private investment rules.  The city had been a significant source of illegal loans, and this project would legalize and provide a regulatory framework for such activities.  It has been seen not only as an attempt to legitimize Wenzhou's private finance market, but also as a model for cleaning up underground lending in China as a whole.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303404704577309051957346004|title=China Tests Financial Relaxation in Wenzhou|author1=Lingling Wei|author2=Dinny McMahon |author3= Tom Orlik| newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=29 March 2012|access-date=1 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915003037/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303404704577309051957346004|archive-date=15 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Birthplace of China's private economy===
In the early days of economic reforms, local Wenzhounese took the lead in China in developing a [[commodity]] economy, household industries and specialized markets. Many thousands of people and families were engaged in household manufacturing to develop individual and private economy ([[private enterprise]]). Until now,{{when|date=August 2022}} Wenzhou has a total of 240,000 individually owned commercial and industrial units and 130,000 private enterprises of which 180 are group companies, four among China's top 500 enterprises and 36 among national 500 top private enterprises.  There are 27 national production bases such as "China's Shoes Capital" and "China's Capital of Electrical Equipment", China's 40 famous trademarks and China's famous-brand products and 67 national inspection-exempt products in the city.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The development of private economy in Wenzhou has created the "Wenzhou Economic Model", which inspires the modernization drive in China.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The city of Wenzhou is a world leader in [[lighter]] manufacturing with over 500 such companies in the city.<ref>[http://japanese.10thnpc.org.cn/english/2002/Apr/31597.htm Wenzhou Lighter Makers Await EU Decision] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306170710/http://japanese.10thnpc.org.cn/english/2002/Apr/31597.htm |date=6 March 2008 }}.

There are many areas in which people of Wenzhou opened the first example of private economy in post-1949 China. For instance, Juneyao Airlines started in July 1991, which is the first private airline company in China. Jinwen Rail Way is also the first rail way company which is built with private capital.

==Transport==
===Air===
The [[Wenzhou Longwan International Airport]] serves the Wenzhou area, with scheduled flights to major cities in mainland China as well as [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]. New direct air routes to Taipei and Cheju Island of South Korea were introduced in 2012. The airport is situated on the southeast of the city (approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} away). It's been graded as Category B civil airport, serving a population of 20 million spanning areas of Wenzhou, Taizhou and Lishui of Zhejiang and Ningde of the neighbouring Fujian. The correlated GDP of the area reaches 300 billion RMB.

The Airport started opening up in 1995 and direct flight to Macau was approved. Air route to Hong Kong was open in 1996. Linking 65 cities in the country with 34 permanently operating air routes, the Airport is among the fastest-growing and profitable among its peers in China.

The Airport ranks first in terms of passenger transit among cities of same level in China. In 2004, the Airport handled 29,700 landings, a passenger transit of 2.439 million, cargo throughput of 38,500 tons.

The new Terminal 2 was launched on 1 June 2018, which handle all domestic flights. The Terminal 1 was changed to international terminal that handles all international and regional (specifically from Wenzhou to Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) flights. The Terminal 2 is equipped with 21 boarding bridges, 22 security check passages, 52 check-in counters (four check-in zones, A, B, C, and D) and 6 luggage claim systems.

===Railway===
[[File:Wenzhounan Railway Station platform, 2012-02-11.jpg|thumb|[[Wenzhou South railway station]]]]
Because of Wenzhou's geographic location, it is difficult to build a railway to connect it with other cities.  Wenzhou's first railway, the [[Jinhua–Wenzhou railway]], opened on 11 June 1998. The railway runs from [[Wenzhou railway station]] northwest to [[Jinhua]] and is operated by the Jinwen Railway Company. The railway has a total length of {{convert|251|km|abbr=on}}, including 135 bridges of {{convert|14|km|abbr=on}} in length 96 tunnels of {{convert|35|km|abbr=on}} in length. The Jinwen Railway was the first in China to be built with local capital, and gave birth to China's first standardized joint-stock enterprise: Zhejiang Jinwen Railway Development Co., Ltd.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jwr.cn/ |title=浙江金温铁道开发有限公司 |access-date=31 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231104915/http://www.jwr.cn/ |archive-date=31 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In September 2009, two high-speed railways opened in Wenzhou.  The [[Ningbo–Taizhou–Wenzhou railway]] runs north to Hangzhou, and the [[Wenzhou–Fuzhou railway]], runs south to [[Xiamen]].<ref>[http://www.whatsonxiamen.com/news8728.html Xiamen-Shenzhen Railway to open by end of next year] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201213941/http://www.whatsonxiamen.com/news8728.html |date=1 December 2009 }}.

The [[Jinhua–Wenzhou high-speed railway]] was opened on 26 December 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://szcb.zjol.com.cn/news/234978.html |script-title=zh:金温铁路12月26日开通运营 现已开始售票 |script-work=zh:浙江新闻 |trans-work=Zhejiang News |language=zh-hans |date=2015-12-25|access-date=2015-12-25|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225141158/http://szcb.zjol.com.cn/news/234978.html|archive-date=2015-12-25}}</ref>

[[Lucheng District, Wenzhou|Lucheng District]] in Wenzhou was the site of China's [[Wenzhou train collision|only major high-speed rail accident]] to date.

===Rapid transit===
{{main|Wenzhou Rail Transit}}
Wenzhou Mass Transit Railway Investment Group was launched in February 2011 with registered capital of 2 billion RMB, sole purpose being in the design, investment, construction and operation of the Wenzhou Mass Transit Rail Corporation, which will consist of regional (S-series lines) and local [[rapid transit]] lines in Wenzhou. The S-Lines serve regional transportation among Wenzhou's Counties and Districts. The first line, Line S1 stretching 53.5 kilometers, opened on 23 January 2019. Construction of Line S2 started on 30 December 2015. A preliminary application with the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) is underway for the initiation of the construction of metro lines M1 and M2, with a total length of {{convert|60.4|km|abbr=on}}.

==Yongjia School==
The [[Yongjia School]] ({{Lang-zh|s=永嘉学派|t=永嘉學派}}) is considered one of the most distinctive [[school of thought|schools of thought]] in the history of China and was one of the three most influential schools of thought in the [[Song Dynasty]].  It has a high status in [[Chinese philosophy]].  Since its founding it has been the cultural gene of the Wenzhou and has influenced China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://zj.zjol.com.cn/news/1218039.html|title = 永嘉学派"义利并举"思想 对新时代温州经济社会发展的启示}}</ref><ref name="wzsk.gov.cn">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wzsk.gov.cn/system/2017/06/29/012803023.shtml|title = 温州市叶适与永嘉学派研究会--温州社科网}}</ref><ref name="yjnet.cn">{{Cite web|url=http://www.yjnet.cn/system/2010/03/04/010186633.shtml|title = 第三节 永嘉学派的发祥地 - 永嘉网}}</ref>

===Main characteristics===
There are four main characteristics and aspects of the Yongjia School.
First, it emphasizes the significance of [[practice (learning method)|practice]] over pure [[theory]].  Second, it proposes that [[chivalry]] should not be divorced from [[welfare]].  Third, it promotes the [[conglomeration]] of [[agriculture]] and [[commerce]].  Fourth it underscores the significance of powerful [[military]] and economic prosperity.<ref name="wzsk.gov.cn"/><ref name="yjnet.cn"/>

===Market economy and capitalism===
Yongjia School is arguably the only prestigious Chinese school of thought of which the main teachings emphasize [[currency]], [[commerce]], and [[private economy]].  Modern scholars attribute the unprecedented [[economic prosperity]] in the [[Song Dynasty]] to the influence of Yongjia School.<ref name="wzsk.gov.cn"/><ref name="yjnet.cn"/>

==Chinese opera==
During the [[Northern Song Dynasty]] in the 12th century, Nan Opera, also called as the Wenzhou Opera and Yongjia Opera, was produced in Wenzhou as the earliest form of traditional [[Chinese Opera]] in the history of China.<ref>{{cite web|script-title=zh:南戲的活化石：婺劇高腔|url=http://big5.news.cn/gate/big5/www.zj.xinhuanet.com/wuopera/2006-09/14/content_8041946.htm |script-work=zh:中國婺劇網 |language=zh-hant  |access-date=29 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530005458/http://big5.news.cn/gate/big5/www.zj.xinhuanet.com/wuopera/2006-09/14/content_8041946.htm|archive-date=30 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="温州南戏的研究">{{cite web|script-title=zh:温州南戏的研究|url=http://www.wznx.cn/fyl/files/温州戏曲史话/温州南戏的研究.htm |script-work=zh:温州戏曲史话 |language=zh-hans|access-date=29 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304233158/http://www.wznx.cn/fyl/files/%E6%B8%A9%E5%B7%9E%E6%88%8F%E6%9B%B2%E5%8F%B2%E8%AF%9D/%E6%B8%A9%E5%B7%9E%E5%8D%97%E6%88%8F%E7%9A%84%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6.htm|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:溫州南戲：佰戲之祖 |url=http://sns.91ddcc.com/t/51142 |script-work=zh:浙江省非物質文化遺產 |trans-work=Zhejiang intangible cultural heritage |language=zh-hans |access-date=29 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530002730/http://sns.91ddcc.com/t/51142 |archive-date=30 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> In its early stage of development, Nan Opera developed and matured rapidly along with the prosperous economic activities that were taking place in Wenzhou influenced by [[Yongjia School of Thought]]. Wenzhou as a prosperous treaty port back in [[Southern Song Dynasty]] expanded the influence of Nan Opera greatly. Since then, Nan Opera gained its great influence in China and reached its peak in [[Yuan Dynasty]] and remained its prominent status in [[Ming Dynasty]].

In the time period of late [[Yuan Dynasty]], the original rulers of the country significantly lost their political power and that gave Nan Opera of Wenzhou a period of time in which it faced almost no resistance in development. Therefore, in late [[Yuan Dynasty]], Nan Opera of Wenzhou reached its highest peak historically and later in [[Ming Dynasty]], its original Wenzhou tone of Opera sung in [[Wenzhounese]] lost its influence and was mostly replaced by Kun Shan tone of Opera. Later on, because of the replacement in tone, Nan Opera gradually transcended into its later form ''[[Chuanqi (theatre)|chuanqi]]'', and remained its influence and became one of the major forms of drama in [[Ming Dynasty]].<ref name="big5.news.cn">{{cite web|url=http://big5.news.cn/gate/big5/www.zj.xinhuanet.com/wuopera/2006-09/14/content_8041946.htm|title=南戲的活化石：婺劇高腔|access-date=1 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530005458/http://big5.news.cn/gate/big5/www.zj.xinhuanet.com/wuopera/2006-09/14/content_8041946.htm|archive-date=30 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Role distribution system===
On the stage setting of a Nan Opera performance, there are generally seven role distribution elements, Life ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|生}}}}), Denier ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|旦}}}}), Ugliness ({{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|醜}}}}), Clarity ({{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|淨}}}}), Finale ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|末}}}}, Exterior ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|外}}}}), Attachment ({{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|貼}}}}), with the main drama plot developed around Life ({{lang|zh|生}}) and Denial ({{lang|zh|旦}}) complemented usually by Ugliness ({{lang|zh-hant|醜}}), Clarity ({{lang|zh-hant|淨}}), and Finale ({{lang|zh|末}}). This stage setting system of Nan Opera invented in Wenzhou with seven-element role distribution principle is the earliest complete on-stage role distribution principle system in the history of [[Chinese Opera]].<ref>{{cite web|script-title=zh:《南曲戏文八百年》之三|url=http://www.cctv.com/opera/special/C12446/20040618/100428.shtml|website=cctv.com Opera|publisher=[[China Central Television|CCTV]] Opera|language=zh-hans|access-date=10 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530005010/http://www.cctv.com/opera/special/C12446/20040618/100428.shtml|archive-date=30 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|script-title=zh:南戏八百年之二|url=http://www.0086577.cn/html/wzgc/2012-11/8/15_46_36_495.html|publisher=World of Wenzhounese|language=zh-hans|access-date=9 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304082908/http://www.0086577.cn/html/wzgc/2012-11/8/15_46_36_495.html|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|script-title=zh:京剧人物画家施昌秀今年"转行" 南戏系列演绎"中国戏剧祖宗"|url=http://www.zjcnt.com/publish/content.php/65791|publisher=Zhejiang Culture Online|language=zh-hans}}{{Dead link|date=January 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Four Miracles of Yuan Dynasty===
Although Nan opera is the first mature form of traditional [[Chinese opera]], throughout its history of development unlike that of many other later forms of Chinese opera, Nan opera was generally disregarded and repelled by the officials in early [[Yuan Dynasty]] who held great contempt for the Southern Chinese people.

Despite the great resistance, local Wenzhounese that kept on developing Nan Drama still managed to compose extraordinary works respectively named as the "Jing Cha Tale", "Bai Tu Tale", "Bai Yue Ting", and "Sha Gou Ji", which were later known as the "Four Miracles" of [[Yuan Dynasty]].{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} According to modern studies, at least half of the Four Miracles were entirely created by local [[Wenzhounese]] artists with no non-local supplements and the other two consisting of some non-local supplements.<ref name="温州南戏的研究"/>

===''Tale of the Pipa''===
''[[Tale of the Pipa]]'' (or ''Tale of Lute'') created by local [[Wenzhounese]] [[Gao Ming]] is a work of Nan opera that represents its highest quality and essence in its highest peak of influence in mid-[[Yuan Dynasty]].<ref name="big5.news.cn"/>

It is called the connecting bridge of the time of Nan opera and the time of ''[[Chuanqi (theatre)|chuanqi]]''. The creation of [[Tale of the Pipa]] is among the greatest achievements of [[Chinese Opera]] and has had an enormous impact on composition of traditional Chinese opera, and therefore, it is usually called as the "Ancestor of all Plays" in China along with Nan drama being called as the "Ancestor of all Operas" in China. In the 19th century, [[Tale of the Pipa]] was translated into English, French, German and Latin.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7EkXzmpwF4C|title=T'ao-hua-shan|first=Shangren|last=Kong|date=1 January 1976|publisher=University of California Press|access-date=1 September 2016|via=Google Books|isbn=9780520029286}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E2fQI6NDKwQC|title=De L' Un Au Multiple.

Like all the other Nan Opera plays written by local [[Wenzhounese]] artists majorly in the original language of [[Wenzhounese]], the Lute Song is known for its complex linguistic demands which has caused international scholars to mainly focus on the shorter, and more accessible version as to their own concepts of the opera.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Strassberg|first1=Richard|title=Review The Lute: Kao Ming's P'i-p'a chi by Jean Mulligan|issue=2|pages=695–697|jstor=2719067|journal=Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies|volume=41|year=1981|doi=10.2307/2719067}}</ref>

===Four forms of Nan opera===
After the invention of Nan opera in Wenzhou in the 12th century, Nan Opera soon after started to spread its influence all across China as the first-ever mature form of Chinese opera. At the time in [[Ming Dynasty]], the original form of Nan Opera sung in [[Wenzhounese]] lost its influence because of its universality and evolved into 4 different forms that were sung in four different tones(melodies). However, some scholars today argue that Nan Opera in [[Ming Dynasty]] were sung in five different tones (melodies).<ref>{{cite web |last1=鄭 |first1=培凱 |script-title=zh:所謂四大聲腔 |url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/supplement/apple/art/20130908/18413361 |work=[[Apple Daily]] |language=zh-hk |access-date=12 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126184144/http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/supplement/apple/art/20130908/18413361 |archive-date=26 November 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The original Nan Opera gave births to four different forms of itself in Ming Dynasty: Haiyan Tone ({{lang|zh-hans|海盐腔}}), [[Yuyao]] Tone ({{lang|zh-hans|余姚腔}}), [[Kunshan]] Tone ({{lang|zh-hans|昆山腔}}), and Yiyang Tone ({{lang|zh-hans|弋阳腔}}). Among the four forms, the most popular one today is known as the [[Kun Opera]] that evolved from the Kunshan Tone of Nan Opera in [[Ming Dynasty]]. [[Kun Opera]] is listed as one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] by [[UNESCO]] since 2001.<ref>[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&pg=00011&RL=00004 "Kun Qu Opera"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801100243/http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&pg=00011&RL=00004 |date=1 August 2015 }}.

==Mathematics==
Wenzhou has a long history of mathematics and many mathematical records in modern China are made by local [[Wenzhounese]] mathematicians and scholars. In 1896, the father of oracle bone script decipherment, [[Wenzhounese]] scholar [[Sun Yirang]], founded the first-ever mathematics academy in the history of China, Ruian Mathematics Academy ({{lang|zh-hant|瑞安學計館}}) in Wenzhou. A year later, in 1897, local [[Wenzhounese]] Huang Qingcheng founded the first-ever periodical of mathematics in China, "Journal of Arithmetic" ({{lang|zh-hant|算学報}}). In 1899, a mathematical association was established in Wenzhou, named "Ruian Heaven Calculation Association" ({{lang|zh-hant|瑞安天算學社}}), making the history of being the very first regional mathematical association in the history of China.<ref>{{cite web|script-title=zh:浙江温州成"数字家之乡"|url=http://www.networkchinese.com/region/china/wesm.html|publisher=A Global Network for Chinese Professionals|language=zh-hans|access-date=2018-12-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063332/http://www.networkchinese.com/region/china/wesm.html|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:温州得开风气之先 "数学家摇篮"名副其实 |url=http://www.china-maths.com/shuxue/news/650.htm |publisher=china-maths.com |language=zh-hans |access-date=20 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113100203/http://www.china-maths.com/shuxue/news/650.htm |archive-date=13 November 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:解读温州数学家群体的科学文化意义 |url=http://www.kexuemag.com/Article/ShowInfo.asp?InfoID=13191 |publisher=科學社 |language=zh-hans |access-date=19 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530003847/http://www.kexuemag.com/Article/ShowInfo.asp?InfoID=13191 |archive-date=30 May 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:温州是我国"数学家之乡" |url=http://www.wzer.net/view/1865.htm |publisher=Wenzhou Bureau of Education |language=zh-hans |access-date=18 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530002520/http://www.wzer.net/view/1865.htm |archive-date=30 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|script-title=zh:涌现教授200余人 温州何以成"数学家之乡"引人关注|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2002-08/21/content_532437.htm|website=[[Xinhua News]]|language=zh-hans|date=2002-08-21|access-date=18 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321160420/http://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2002-08/21/content_532437.htm|archive-date=21 March 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|script-title=zh:温州何以成"数学家之乡"引人关注|url=http://tech.sina.com.cn/o/2002-08-21/1007133750.shtml|website=[[Sina Corp|Sina]] News|language=zh-hans|date=2002-08-21|access-date=18 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530010956/http://tech.sina.com.cn/o/2002-08-21/1007133750.shtml|archive-date=30 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Cradle of Mathematicians===

Wenzhou is renowned as the cradle of mathematicians in the Greater China Region; it has given births to over 200 mathematicians known both internationally and domestically in the past 100 years. According to numerous reports, in the 20th century, over one-fourth to one-third of chairs of mathematics department of colleges and mathematical associations all over China were local [[Wenzhounese]] mathematicians and scholars. During 2002 [[International Mathematical Union]] conference in [[Beijing]], a case study named "analysis of vast communal formation of Wenzhounese mathematicians" ({{lang|zh-hans|温籍数学家群体成因分析}}) was discussed by mathematicians from all over the world. The goal of analyzing the case study was to understand and acknowledge the significance of the cultural influence of Wenzhounese mathematicians and their contributions to mathematics. The case study was also brought up during the conference to analyze the future trend of cultivating a new generation of mathematicians in China and around the world. Such a rare phenomenon has never existed in the history of the world as throughout the history of the city, Wenzhou has given births to more mathematicians more than any other city in the world.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:南塘河畔，展现"数学家摇篮" |url=http://www.wzyxnt.com/Art/Art_12/Art_12_210.aspx |publisher=印象南塘 [Impression Nantang] |language=zh-hans |access-date=10 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530010159/http://www.wzyxnt.com/Art/Art_12/Art_12_210.aspx |archive-date=30 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|script-title=zh:涌現教授200余人 溫州何以成"數學家之鄉"引人關注|url=http://big5.china.com.cn/chinese/2002/Aug/192191.htm|website=china.com.cn|language=zh-hans|access-date=9 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530023416/http://big5.china.com.cn/chinese/2002/Aug/192191.htm|archive-date=30 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

In an interview with local Wenzhounese mathematician, one of the pioneers of mathematics in modern China [[Su Buqing]],<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:苏步青: 中国微分几何学派的创立者|url=http://www.fudan.org.cn/archives/16412 |publisher=[[Fudan University]] |language=zh-hans |access-date=31 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317110532/http://www.fudan.org.cn/archives/16412|archive-date=17 March 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> conducted by Wenzhounese science fiction writer [[Ye Yonglie]], many unknown details of the local Wenzhou mathematics culture were revealed. [[Ye Yonglie]] was told by [[Su Buqing]] that "many of the chairs of math departments of major universities in China were local Wenzhounese and in the conferences of [[International Mathematical Union]], the local language of [[Wenzhounese]] is the unofficial and second language of the union besides official language English." Moreover, when Ye Yonglie asked Su Buqing whether "the commonly shared Wenzhounese cuisine culture of consuming [[Large yellow croaker]] was one of the major reasons of the vast formation of local mathematicians", Su Buqing answered "No, no, no. It's rather because the entire area of Wenzhou is too poor to do science, and it only takes the cost of a pencil to do math, therefore, most of the Wenzhounese people just started to do math, and then, generations of local mathematicians just kept coming out of the city."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ye |first1=Yonglie (葉永烈) |script-title=zh:葉永烈：折翼的温州文化 |url=http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_470bc6dd0102eqac.html |publisher=[[Sina Weibo]] |language=zh-hans |access-date=27 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530011435/http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_470bc6dd0102eqac.html |archive-date=30 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Jiang Lifu===
Wenzhounese mathematician [[Jiang Lifu]] is commonly considered as the father of mathematics and pioneer of [[geometry]] in modern China. Jiang was the second person in modern China's history to obtain a PhD in mathematics and the first to do so in Wenzhou. In 1920, he returned to China and founded the Department of Mathematics at [[Nankai University]], the second-ever mathematics department in the history of modern China. He was the only professor and teacher in the department for the first four years and was very strict with his teaching and students.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnxw.com.cn/system/2019/02/15/013474255.shtml|title = 姜立夫：中国现代数学教育的奠基人 - 苍南新闻网}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.xys.org/xys/ebooks/others/science/people/chenxingshen3.txt |title=

In 1940, Jiang became the chairman of the "Neo-China Mathematics Society." In 1947, Jiang founded the Institute of Mathematics of [[Academia Sinica]] and was the institute's founding director. He appointed his student, one of the most influential mathematicians of the 20th century, [[Shiing-Shen Chern]] to become the institute's acting director in Shanghai. Jiang also played a pioneering and fundamental role in encouraging and arranging foreign studies of mathematics for Chinese students in modern China in the early 20th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.math.sinica.edu.tw/www/about/history20_e.jsp|title = Brief History, Inst. Math. Academia Sinica}}</ref>

Mathematician [[Shiing-Shen Chern]] once noted that "for many years, Mr. Jiang was the foremost leader in the field of mathematics in China"(在许多年的时间里，姜先生是中国数学界最主要的领袖). [[Su Buqing]] also noted that "his influence and contribution to mathematics in modern China is so grand that without him, mathematics in China would have been completely different"(他对中国现代数学事业功劳重大，影响至深，没有他，中国数学面貌将会是另一个样子).<ref name="image.sciencenet.cn"/>

===Shiing-Shen Chern===
In October 2003, mathematician [[Shiing-Shen Chern]] visited Wenzhou as invited by Wenzhounese mathematician [[Gu Chaohao]]. During his visit, Chern wrote five words in Chinese calligraphy, "Home of Mathematicians," as he was marveled by the large number of prominent mathematicians and mathematical scholars from the city of Wenzhou.<ref name="image.sciencenet.cn"/><ref name="old.cim.nankai.edu.cn">http://old.cim.nankai.edu.cn/mtbaodao/MTnim/wzrb031217.htm{{Dead link|date=February 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Throughout Chern's life, he developed many close and meaningful relationships with mathematicians from Wenzhou.

For instance, Chern's first mathematics teacher, mentor, and professor in life is [[Wenzhounese]] mathematician, [[Jiang Lifu]]. Jiang was the second person in modern China's history to obtain a PhD in mathematics and founded the Department of Mathematics at [[Nankai University]], Chern's alma mater. Chern once noted that "I specialize in [[geometry]] because of my professor in college, Dr. Jiang"(我从事几何大都亏了我的大学老师姜立夫博士) and "my fundamental mathematical education was all given by Mr. Jiang through dictation"(我的基本数学训练都是姜先生口授的).<ref name="old.cim.nankai.edu.cn"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cmsold.cms.org.cn/zl/chen/20110211-24.htm|title=国际数学大师陈省身：叶落归根不离南开|website=cmsold.cms.org.cn}}</ref>

===Taiwanese high-tech industry===
Wenzhounese mathematician [[Shu Shien-Siu]] is today considered as the father of the high-tech industry in Taiwan while the high-tech industry today is considered to be the biggest contributor to Taiwan's economy. When Siu was the [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Taiwan)|Minister of Science and Technology]] from 1973 to 1980, he proposed to establish the [[Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park]] in [[Hsinchu]] in 1976.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://my.nthu.edu.tw/~secretar2/pub/147/5/1.pdf|title=淺談前校長徐賢修先生 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720045055/http://my.nthu.edu.tw/~secretar2/pub/147/5/1.pdf | archive-date=2011-07-20}}</ref>

After Siu's revolutionary proposal, rounds of debate about the location of [[Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park]] unfolded. [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] argued that the park should be built in [[Longtan District, Taoyuan|Longtan District]] in [[Taoyuan, Taiwan|Taoyuan]] considering the potential benefits that could be drawn from [[National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology]] and future relationship between the military field and the park. However, [[Shu Shien-Siu]] argued that the park should be built in [[Hsinchu]] because what [[Taiwan]] and the park needed was creativity and private economic power that would stem from the people instead of the government and the military. Therefore, Siu said that it was not a wise decision to draw too much relation between the military and the science and industrial park.  Also, [[Longtan District, Taoyuan|Longtan District]] was a relatively remote place as compared to [[Hsinchu]] and thus, the potential of the park would be greatly diminished if it were to be built in [[Longtan District, Taoyuan|Longtan District]].

More importantly, Siu's decision made in 1976 is commonly praised today as he foresaw the right model of the park. Siu wanted the [[Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park]] to be like [[Silicon Valley]] which is adjacent to [[Stanford University]] and [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Thinking differently from [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], Siu saw the potential advantages and tremendous resources the [[Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park]] could benefit from the [[National Tsing Hua University]] and [[National Chiao Tung University]]. Therefore, Siu determined to manage to build the park in [[Hsinchu]], where both universities are located at.

Today, [[Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park]] is commonly considered as the [[Silicon Valley]] of the [[Orient]] and the high-tech industry stands as the biggest contributor to Taiwan's economy.

===Higher education in Taiwan===
In 1961, [[Shu Shien-Siu]] founded the Department of Mathematics at [[National Tsing Hua University]], one of the most prestigious universities in [[Taiwan]]. A year later in 1962, Siu founded the Summer Mathematics Conference, the first-ever mathematical conference in the history of Taiwan.<ref name="清華大學數學系">{{cite web |script-title=zh:人物記事／徐賢修教授 |url=http://www.math.nthu.edu.tw/about/riki.php?id=許賢修教授&CID=1 |publisher=[[National Tsing Hua University]] |language=zh-hant |access-date=2018-12-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317085626/http://www.math.nthu.edu.tw/about/riki.php?CID=1&id=%E8%A8%B1%E8%B3%A2%E4%BF%AE%E6%95%99%E6%8E%88 |archive-date=17 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

When Siu became the president of [[National Tsing Hua University]] in 1970, there were only 3 academic departments and no college on campus and the university only held a population of over 660 people including faculty members. In order to expand the size of the university and contribute to the growth of [[Taiwan]], Siu organized to establish the college of [[engineering]] that consists of five departments and expanded the Institute of Nuclear Engineering and Science by transforming it into the college of [[nuclear science]] which consists of two departments and one institute. From 1971 to 1973, Siu managed to employ a total of 165 professors with [[doctoral degree]]s. Also, during his presidency, Siu carried out the 15-year strategic plan for the university and placed heavy emphasis on the construction of buildings on campus such as the Department of Chemistry, the auditorium, the gymnasium and dormitories for students and housing buildings for academic staff as Siu sought to increase the bond between the academic staff and the students.<ref name="清華大學數學系"/><ref name="纪念数学家徐贤修百年诞辰">{{cite web|last1=Xu |first1=Yilong (徐逸龙) |last2=Fu |first2=Zong (傅宗) |script-title=zh:纪念数学家徐贤修百年诞辰|url=http://www.wenzhou.gov.cn/art/2012/9/3/art_9832_234241.html |publisher=Wenzhou People's government |language=zh-hans |date=2012-09-03 |access-date=13 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603220349/http://www.wenzhou.gov.cn/art/2012/9/3/art_9832_234241.html|archive-date=3 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="淺談前校長徐賢修先生 - 國立清華大學">{{cite web |last1=Zhang |first1=Zhongwei (張仲瑋) |title=淺談前校長徐賢修先生 |script-title=zh:淺談前校長徐賢修先生 – 國立清華大學 |url=http://my.nthu.edu.tw/~secretar2/pub/147/5/1.pdf |publisher=[[National Tsing Hua University]] |language=zh-hant |access-date=13 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180516204009/http://my.nthu.edu.tw/~secretar2/pub/147/5/1.pdf |archive-date=16 May 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

By the time he left [[National Tsing Hua University]] in 1975, the university had a total of nine departments, three colleges, and 13 institutes with a student population of over 2200(including graduate students) and academic staff population of over 160. In 1975, after Siu's five years of presidency, [[National Tsing Hua University]] placed first in all three fields of [[Mathematics]], [[Physics]], and [[Chemistry]] in Taiwan.<ref name="淺談前校長徐賢修先生 - 國立清華大學"/>

As Siu was deeply influenced by the [[Yongjia School of Thought]] when he grew up in Wenzhou, during his presidential career at the university, Siu placed heavy emphasis on the idea of practicality instead of the traditional Chinese belief of the importance of theory, and also made it clear that as students, the interaction with the society will always be more important than that within the campus. One of the most influential quotes of Siu is "What we need the most are the practitioners, who directly involve, but not the theorists" ({{lang|zh-hans|我们最需要的是实行家，直接的参与，而非理论家}}). That main idea held by Siu to build the university in its early stage of development is almost identical as one of the central philosophies of [[Yongjia School of Thought]], the cultural gene of the city of Wenzhou. Such a unique form of philosophy of Siu would later be proven to have a tremendous impact on the school and Taiwan's history as today, [[National Tsing Hua University]] is known for its emphasis on practicality in [[Taiwan]].<ref name="清華大學數學系"/><ref name="纪念数学家徐贤修百年诞辰"/><ref name="淺談前校長徐賢修先生 - 國立清華大學"/>

=="City of chess"==
In 1995, Wenzhou was given the title of "City of Chess" by [[China Qiyuan]], the official agency responsible for all [[board games]] and [[card games]] in mainland China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sohu.com/a/419856676_495631|title="棋城"温州迎来25岁生日！这些全国第一铸就"国象之魂"_中国棋院|website=[[Sohu]]}}</ref><ref name="dy.163.com">{{Cite web|url=https://dy.163.com/article/FN4JTCR1053720YN.html|title="棋城"温州的这些"全国第一"，你都知道吗？|date=22 September 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.66wz.com/system/2015/07/24/104520160.shtml|title=二十年，棋城铸棋魂|website=news.66wz.com}}</ref> In 2020, Wenzhou celebrated its 25th anniversary of being the "City of Chess" in China. President of [[FIDE]] [[Arkady Dvorkovich]] sent a congratulatory letter to Wenzhou remarking that "Wenzhou has given births to many genius chess players, [[Ye Rongguang]], [[Zhu Chen]], [[Ding Liren]], congratulate the 25th anniversary of Wenzhou being titled the "City of Chess" in China.<ref name="dy.163.com"/>

===Zhu Chen===
Wenzhounese chess practitioner and grandmaster [[Zhu Chen]] is the first and currently, the only, chess player in the history of the world to win all youth, junior, and adult world championships. In August 1988, Zhu placed first and won the World Girls Under 12 Championship in Romania. In September 1994, Zhu placed first and won the World Girls Junior Chess Championship in [[Matinhos]], Brazil. In November 1996, Zhu placed first and won the World Girls Junior Chess Championship in [[Medellin]], [[Colombia]]. In December 2001, Zhu placed first and won the World Women's Individual Championship in [[Moscow]], Russia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Zhu-Chen|title=Zhu Chen &#124; Women's World Champion, Grandmaster, Chinese National Team &#124; Britannica|website=www.britannica.com|date=12 March 2024 }}</ref>

In March 2002, during the [[FIDE Grand Prix]] in [[Dubai]], Zhu defeated [[Ruslan Ponomariov]], the World Chess Champion from 2002 to 2004, and knocked him out of the tournament, making her the first and only female world champion and athlete to defeat a male world champion in any competitive sport in the history of the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thechessdrum.net/newsbriefs/2002/NB_Dubai2002.html|title = In the Unofficial Championship, Zhu eliminates Ponomariov!!}}</ref>

==Culture and demographics==
===Language===
{{main|Wenzhounese}}
Wenzhou natives speak a language of [[Wu Chinese]], the language family shared by [[Hangzhou]], [[Ningbo]], [[Suzhou]] and [[Shanghai]]; called [[Wenzhounese]], also known as Oujiang ({{zh|s=瓯江话 |t=甌江話 |p=Ōujiānghuà |labels=no}}) or Dong'ou ({{zh|s=东瓯 |t=東甌 |labels=no}}). Geographic isolation and the immigration of [[Southern Min]] speakers from nearby [[Fujian]] have caused [[Wenzhounese]] to evolve into a very [[phonologically]] divergent hybrid difficult for outsiders to understand. As a result, even the adjacent [[Taizhou Wu]] variety has little [[mutual intelligibility]] with Wenzhounese. Conversely Wenzhouness itself has spread to the [[Chinese emigration|Chinese immigrant]] communities in the [[Flushing Chinatown|Flushing]] and [[Brooklyn Chinatown]]s of [[Chinese people in New York City|New York City]].

The esoteric Wenzhounese language is reputed to have been used during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] during wartime communication and in the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]] for programming military ciphers ([[code]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.163.com/14/0517/12/9SEQN8RN00014AEE.html |script-title=zh:网友总结最难懂方言:温州话让敌军窃听也听不懂_网易新闻中心 |publisher=[[163.com|163]] News |language=zh-hans |access-date=1 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006090820/http://news.163.com/14/0517/12/9SEQN8RN00014AEE.html |archive-date=6 October 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>Some believe that the code used during the Sino-Vietnamese War was not Wenzhounese, but the dialect from [[Cangnan County]] (then part of [[Pingyang County]]).

There is a common "fearing" rhymed saying in China that reflects the extreme comprehension difficulty of Wenzhounese: "Fear not the Heavens, fear not the Earth, but fear the Wenzhou person speaking Wenzhounese." ({{lang|zh-hans|天不怕，地不怕，就怕温州人说温州话}})

===Religion===

Most of the Wenzhou people practice [[Chinese folk religion]] as people in the rest of China, while a part of the population is [[irreligious|non-religious]]. In addition, [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Christianity]] also have a presence in the city.

Prior to 1949 there were 2,000 registered places of worship and 4,500 priests, pastors and monks in the city. But, the state officially designated Wenzhou as an experimental site for an "atheistic zone" ({{lang|zh-hans|无宗教区}}) in 1958 and during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–1976), religious buildings were either closed or converted for other uses.<ref name="Nanlai Cao 2010">Nanlai Cao.

Covered bridges, [[Taishun County]] has more than 900 covered bridges, [[Wuyanling National Nature Reserve]] in the west of the county represents significant natural values as well as being a touristic attraction.

Due to the variety and diverseness of local tourism attractions, Wenzhou was voted as the venue for the 2016 Annual Convention of Society for American Travel Writers (SATW) in October 2016, after beating contenders including Israel, the State of Texas, and Royal Caribbean International, the world leading cruise operator.

===Art and literature===
Wenzhou is 1682 years old with a profound and brilliant cultural background. It has given birth to many outstanding people and great scholars. Among them were [[Wang Shipeng]], [[Chen Fuliang]], [[Ye Shi]], [[Huang Gongwang]] and [[Liu Ji (Song Dynasty)|Liu Ji]] during the South Song Dynasty, as well as [[Sun Yirang]], [[Xia Nai]], [[Xia Chengtao]] and [[Su Buqing]] and others of the modern era. All of them have exerted significant influence in the history of Chinese philosophy, literature and science. Wenzhou is also the origin of China's landscape poetry, the founder of which, [[Xie Lingyun]], was the chief of Wenzhou's Yongjia Prefecture in the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] period. In [[Song Dynasty]], there were 4 distinguished poets from Yongjia representing the River and Lake Poetry. Moreover, Wenzhou is the birthplace of Nan Drama of China, which is the origin of Chinese traditional drama of which includes drama forms such as [[Peking Opera]] and Yue Opera.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wz.people.com.cn/n/2014/0103/c140246-20292423.html |title=南戏博物馆：戏曲故里寻声腔遗韵--温州频道--人民网 |website=People's Daily |access-date=15 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916034440/http://wz.people.com.cn/n/2014/0103/c140246-20292423.html |archive-date=16 September 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> "The Romance of a Hairpin", a tale about Wang Shipeng and Qian Yulian, is well known among locals and serves an inspiration for many who have endured life pains but still have faith in love.  For instance, "Tale of Lute", a play by [[Gao Zecheng]] of Ming Dynasty, is renowned abroad as one of the most outstanding works of Chinese drama along with [[Kun Opera]] of Yongjia which is recognized as the verbal and non-material human heritage. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWAgryiIZhM Dancing in public is also part of the Wenzhou culture].  Wenzhou, the birthplace of China's [[private economy]], likewise is the birthplace of China's [[export-oriented industrialization]]. From the [[Southern Song Dynasty]], in contrasted to the [[Confucianism]] represented by [[Zhu Xi]] and [[Lu Jiuyuan]] in China urging people to study to be officials in the future, the theory of Wenzhou's Yongjia School represented by [[Ye Shi]], emphasized the importance of business. The theory has an enduring impact on the mindset of Wenzhou natives and has become the "cultural gene" in the economic development of Wenzhou ever since.

===Business culture===
Due to both Wenzhou's cultural and geographical remoteness and its lack of natural resources (land, minerals, etc.), the Chinese central government has left the people of Wenzhou relatively autonomous. Away from the center of the political and economic stage, its people are more independent, self-reliant, and generally more business and family oriented. Numerous books have been published about the business sense of people from Wenzhou. Hence, when China switched from its [[planned economy]] to its so-called [[capitalist economy]] with Chinese (socialist) characteristics in the late 1980s, its people adjusted well to the new system and took advantage of it. A popular common saying calls Wenzhounese the "Jews of the Orient" ({{lang|zh-hans|东方的犹太人}}).{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} Wenzhounese have been stereotyped by other Chinese{{Which|date=April 2023}} as real estate speculators. [[China Daily]] notes that investments from Wenzhounese buyers play a disproportionately large role in the increased property prices all over China.<ref name="China Daily">{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-04/20/content_855441.htm|title=Chinese speculators eye property overseas|access-date=23 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128010415/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-04/20/content_855441.htm|archive-date=28 January 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

The people of Wenzhou are thought to be equipped with business sense and a commercial culture more dominant than anywhere else in China. Wenzhou has two economic characteristics: it was the first to launch a [[market economy]], and it continues to have an active and developed [[private economy]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=China's Capital of Capitalism Weathers Recession|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124740579|access-date=2020-06-29|publisher=NPR|language=en}}</ref>

There are three major universities in Wenzhou: [[Wenzhou University]], [[Wenzhou Medical University]] and Wenzhou-Kean University.
Wenzhou University resulted from the merger of the former University of Wenzhou, Wenzhou Normal College and other various normal colleges in the rural towns of Wenzhou. Its main campus is situated in the University Town, Cha Shan ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|茶山}}). The former campus of Wenzhou Normal College on Xueyuan Road ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|学院路}}) is still in use, while the former main campus of the University of Wenzhou now serves as the campus of the Wenzhou Foreign Language School and the Second Experimental Middle School of Wenzhou (No.13 Middle School).{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Wenzhou Medical University is well-known globally in specializing in ophthalmology (national level key discipline), as well as provision of other medical courses. Several of Wenzhou's major hospitals are affiliated to this university, with Wenzhou No.1 Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University being the largest in floor space in Asia. The combined population of medical service covered by all the affiliated hospitals of Wenzhou Medical University is said to be over 20 million.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}
