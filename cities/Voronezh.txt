===Foundation and name===
[[File:Beker van Voronezj Voronezh drinking vessel (4e eeuw v. Chr. 4th century BC).jpg|thumb|[[Scythian]] vessel from Voronezh, 4th century BC. [[Hermitage Museum]].]] 
The first chronicle references to the word "Voronezh" are dated 1177, when the Ryazan prince Yaropolk, having lost the battle, fled "to Voronozh" and there was moving "from town to town". Modern data of archeology and history interpret Voronezh as a geographical region, which included the [[Voronezh River|Voronezh river]] (tributary of the [[Don River|Don]]) and a number of settlements. In the lower reaches of the river, a unique Slavic town-planning complex of the 8th – early 11th century was discovered, which covered the territory of the present city of Voronezh and its environs (about 42&nbsp;km long, about 13 forts and many unfortified villages). By the 12th – 13th centuries, most of the old towns were desolate, but new settlements appeared upstream, closer to [[Ryazan]].<ref>В. П. Загоровский. "Воронежская историческая энциклопедия". Воронеж, 1992. Стр. 53.</ref><ref>А. З. Винников, А. Т. Синюк. "Дорогами тысячелетий: Археологи о древней истории Воронежского края". Издание 2-е. Воронеж, 2003. Стр. 185–187, 236–242.</ref><ref>Н.

"Воронеж: древнее слово и древние города, а также древние леса и древние реки России". Воронеж, 2016.</ref>

For many years, the hypothesis of the Soviet historian [[Vladimir Zagorovsky]] dominated: he produced the toponym "Voronezh" from the hypothetical Slavic personal name ''Voroneg''. This man allegedly gave the name of a small town in the [[Chernigov Principality]] (now the village of [[Voronizh]] in [[Ukraine]]<ref>''Woroneż'' (Wronasz) is shown on the ''Woroneż'' river by  [[Stefan Maria Kuczyński|Stefan Kuczyński]]  (1936) in a historical map of 15th-century Chernigov, ''[[:File:Ziemie Czernihowsko-Siewierskie w XV wieku.jpg|«Ziemie Czernihowsko-Siewierskie pod rządami Litwy»]]''.</ref>). Later, in the 11th or 12th century, the settlers were able to "transfer" this name to the Don region, where they named the second city Voronezh, and the river got its name from the city.<ref>В. П. Загоровский. "О древнем Воронеже и слове «Воронеж»". Издание 2-е. Воронеж, 1977.</ref><ref>Е. М. Поспелов. "Географические названия мира". Москва, 1998. Стр. 104.</ref> However, now many researchers criticize the hypothesis, since in reality neither the name of ''Voroneg'' nor the second city was revealed, and usually the names of Russian cities repeated the names of the rivers, but not vice versa.

The linguistic [[comparative linguistics|comparative analysis]] of the name "Voronezh" was carried out by the Khovansky Foundation in 2009. There is an indication of the place names of many countries in Eurasia, which may partly be not only similar in sound, but also united by common Indo-European languages: [[Varanasi]], [[Varna, Bulgaria|Varna]], [[Verona]], [[Brno]], etc.<ref name="Lazarev">А. Лазарев. "Тайна имени Воронежъ" (''The Mystery of the Name of Voronezh''). Воронеж, 2009.</ref>

A comprehensive scientific analysis was conducted in 2015–2016 by the historian Pavel Popov. His conclusion: "Voronezh" is a probable Slavic macrotoponym associated with outstanding signs of nature, has a root ''voron-'' (from the [[proto-Slavic]] ''vorn'') in the meaning of "black, dark" and the suffix ''-ezh'' ''(-azh, -ozh''). It was not “transferred” and in the 8th - 9th centuries it marked a vast territory covered with black forests (oak forests) - from the mouth of the Voronezh river to the Voronozhsky annalistic forests in the middle and upper reaches of the river, and in the west to the Don (many forests were cut down). The historian believes that the main "city" of the early town-planning complex could repeat the name of the region – Voronezh. Now the hillfort is located in the administrative part of the modern city, in the Voronezh upland oak forest. This is one of Europe's largest ancient Slavic hillforts, the area of which – more than 9 hectares – 13 times the area of the main settlement in [[Kyiv]] before the baptism of Rus.<ref name=":0" /><ref>П. А. Попов. "Комплексный подход в топонимических исследованиях в связи с историей русского градостроительства (на примере Центрального Черноземья)". Девятые всероссийские краеведческие чтения (Москва – Воронеж, 15–19 мая 2015 г.). Москва; Воронеж, 2016. Стр. 423–434.</ref>

In [https://huji-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/att40d/972HUJI_ALMA21273296650003701] it is assumed that the word "Voronezh" means bluing - a technique to increase the corrosion resistance of iron products. This explanation fits well with the proximity to the ancient city of Voronezh of a large iron deposit and the city of Stary Oskol. As well as the name of [[Voroneț Monastery]] known for its blue shade. {{namedropping|date=September 2024}}

[[Folk etymology]] claims the name comes from combining the Russian words for raven (''[[:wikt:ворон#Russian|ворон]]'') and hedgehog (''[[:wikt:еж#Russian|еж]]'') into ''Воронеж''. According to this explanation two Slavic tribes named after the animals used this combination to name the river which later in turn provided the name for a settlement. There is not believed to be any scientific support for this explanation.

In the 16th century, the Middle Don basin, including the Voronezh river, was  gradually conquered by Muscovy from the [[Nogai Horde]] (a successor state of the [[Golden Horde]]), and the current city of Voronezh was established in 1585 by [[Feodor I of Russia|Feodor&nbsp;I]] as a fort protecting the  [[Muravsky Trail]] trade route against the [[Crimean–Nogai slave raids in Eastern Europe|slave raids of the Nogai and Crimean Tatars]]. The city was named after the river.<ref name="Foundation1585"/>

In the 17th century, Voronezh gradually evolved into a sizable town.
''Weronecz'' is shown on the ''Worona'' river in [[Principality of Ryazan|Resania]] in [[Joan Blaeu]]'s map of 1645.<ref>''[[:File:Blaeu 1645 - Russiæ vulgo Moscovia pars australis.jpg|Russiæ, vulgo Moscovia, pars australis]]''

[[Peter the Great]] built a [[:ru:Воронежское адмиралтейство|dockyard in Voronezh]] where the Azov Flotilla was constructed for the [[Azov campaigns]] in 1695 and 1696. This fleet, the first ever built in Russia, included the first Russian [[ship of the line]], ''[[Goto Predestinatsia]]''. The Orthodox diocese of Voronezh was instituted in 1682 and its first bishop, [[Mitrofan of Voronezh]], was later proclaimed the town's patron saint.
[[File:Voronezhold.jpg|thumb|right|View of Voronezh in the 18th century]]

Owing to the Voronezh Admiralty Wharf, for a short time, Voronezh became the largest city of South Russia and the economic center of a large and fertile region. In 1711, it was made the seat of the [[Azov Governorate]], which eventually morphed into the [[Voronezh Governorate]].

In the 19th century, Voronezh was the center of Voronezh Governorate. Manufacturing industry (mills, tallow-melting, butter-making, soap, leather, and other works) as well as bread, cattle, [[suet]], and the hair trade developed in the town. A railway connected Voronezh with [[Moscow]] in 1868 and [[Rostov-on-Don]] in 1871.

===20th century===
====World War II====
During [[World War II]], Voronezh was the scene of fierce fighting between Soviet and combined Axis troops. The Germans used it as a staging area for their attack on [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], and made it a key crossing point on the Don River. In June 1941, two BM-13 (Fighting machine #13 ''[[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]]'') artillery installations were built at the Voronezh excavator factory. In July, the construction of ''Katyushas'' was rationalized so that their manufacture became easier and the time of volley repetition was shortened from five minutes to fifteen seconds. More than 300 BM-13 units manufactured in Voronezh were used in a counterattack near Moscow in December 1941. In October&nbsp;22, 1941, the advance of the German troops prompted the establishment of a defense committee in the city. On November&nbsp;7, 1941, there was a troop parade, devoted to the anniversary of the [[October Revolution]]. Only three such parades were organized that year: in Moscow, [[Samara, Russia|Kuybyshev]], and Voronezh. In late June 1942, the city was [[Battle of Voronezh (1942)|attacked]] by German and Hungarian forces. In response, Soviet forces formed the [[Voronezh Front]]. By July&nbsp;6, the German army occupied the western river-bank suburbs before being subjected to a fierce Soviet counter-attack. By July&nbsp;24 the frontline had stabilised along the Voronezh River as the German forces continued southeast into the Great Bend of the Don. The attack on Voronezh represented the first phase of the German Army's 1942 campaign in the Soviet Union, codenamed [[Case Blue]].
[[File:Niemiecki wóz pancerny w drodze do Woroneża (2-960).jpg|thumb|German mechanized forces on their way to Voronezh, July 1942]]
Until January&nbsp;25, 1943, parts of the [[2nd Army (Wehrmacht)|Second German Army]] and the [[Second Army (Hungary)|Second Hungarian Army]] occupied the western part of Voronezh. During [[Operation Little Saturn]], the [[Ostrogozhsk–Rossosh Offensive]], and the Voronezhsko-Kastornenskoy Offensive, the Voronezh Front exacted heavy casualties on Axis forces. On January&nbsp;25, 1943, Voronezh was [[Battle of Voronezh (1943)|liberated after ten days of combat]]. During the war the city was almost completely ruined, with 92% of all buildings destroyed.

====Post-war====
By 1950, Voronezh had been rebuilt. Most buildings and historical monuments were repaired. It was also the location of a prestigious [[Suvorov Military School]], a [[boarding school]] for young boys who were considered to be prospective military officers, many of whom had been orphaned by war.<ref>Alex Levin, ''[http://www.azrielifoundation.org/memoirs/books/under-the-yellow-and-red-stars/ Under The Yellow & Red Stars] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809010630/http://www.azrielifoundation.org/memoirs/books/under-the-yellow-and-red-stars/ |date=August 9, 2016 }}'' ([[Azrieli Foundation]], 2009), pp. 45ff., "The Suvorov Military School".</ref>

In 1950–1960, new factories were established: a tire factory, a machine-tool factory, a factory of heavy mechanical pressing, and others.
In 1968, Serial production of the [[Tupolev Tu-144]] supersonic plane was established at the Voronezh Aviation factory. In October 1977, the first Soviet domestic wide-body plane, [[Ilyushin Il-86]], was built there.

In 1989, [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]] published details of an alleged [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] [[Voronezh UFO incident|landing]] in the city's park and purported encounters with [[extraterrestrials|extraterrestrial beings]] reported by a number of children. A Russian scientist that was cited in initial TASS reports later told the [[Associated Press]] that he was misquoted, cautioning, "Don't believe all you hear from TASS," and "We never gave them part of what they published",<ref name=AP>{{cite news|last=Dahlberg|first=John-Thor|title=Voronzeh Scientist Quoted by TASS Casts Doubt on UFO Landing Story|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&dat=19891011&id=-xQxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=y-AFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1042,2604606|newspaper=Associated Press|date=October 11, 1989}}</ref> and a TASS correspondent admitted the possibility that some "make-believe" had been added to the TASS story, saying, "I think there is a certain portion of truth, but it is not excluded that there is also fantasizing".<ref name=UPI>{{cite news|title=UFO lands in Russia?

From 10 to 17 September 2011, Voronezh celebrated its 425th anniversary. The anniversary of the city was given the status of a federal scale celebration that helped attract large investments from the [[Federal budget of Russia|federal and regional budgets]] for development.<ref>Интерактивная карта подготовки к 425-летию основания Воронежа (рус.).

On December&nbsp;17, 2012, Voronezh became the fifteenth city in Russia with a population of over one million people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://top.rbc.ru/society/17/12/2012/836948.shtml|title=В Воронеже родился миллионный житель|work=РБК|access-date=July 22, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305084646/http://top.rbc.ru/society/17/12/2012/836948.shtml|archive-date=March 5, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Today Voronezh is the economic, industrial, cultural, and scientific center of the [[Central Black Earth Region]]. As part of the annual tradition in the Russian city of Voronezh, every winter the main city square is thematically drawn around a classic literature. In 2020, the city was decorated using the motifs from [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s [[The Nutcracker]]. In the year of 2021, the architects drew inspiration from [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s fairy tale ''[[The Snow Queen]]'' as well as the animation classic ''[[The Snow Queen (1957 film)|The Snow Queen]]'' from the Soviet Union. The fairy tale replica city will feature the houses of Kai and Gerda, the palace of the snow queen, an ice rink, and illumination.<ref>{{Cite web|last=ПОДЪЯБЛОНСКАЯ|first=Татьяна|date=2020-10-05|title=Дворец, лабиринт и сани: главную площадь Воронежа в Новый год украсят в стиле "Снежной королевы"|url=https://www.vrn.kp.ru/daily/217191/4298756/|access-date=2020-12-16|website=vrn.kp.ru|archive-date=December 30, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201230154604/https://www.vrn.kp.ru/daily/217191/4298756/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Воронежцам показали, как оформят к Новому году площадь Ленина — В Воронеже — Культура ВРН|url=https://culturavrn.ru/vrn/31841?highlight=%25D0%25A1%25D0%259D%25D0%2595%25D0%2596%25D0%259D%25D0%2590%25D0%25AF+%25D0%259A%25D0%259E%25D0%25A0%25D0%259E%25D0%259B%25D0%2595%25D0%2592%25D0%2590+1957|access-date=2020-12-16|website=culturavrn.ru|archive-date=February 14, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220214142056/https://culturavrn.ru/vrn/31841?highlight=%25D0%25A1%25D0%259D%25D0%2595%25D0%2596%25D0%259D%25D0%2590%25D0%25AF+%25D0%259A%25D0%259E%25D0%25A0%25D0%259E%25D0%259B%25D0%2595%25D0%2592%25D0%2590+1957|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Geography==
===Urban layout===
Information about the original urban layout of Voronezh is contained in the "Patrol Book" of 1615. At that time, the city fortress was logged and located on the banks of the Voronezh River. In plan, it was an irregular quadrangle with a perimeter of about 238 meter. inside it, due to lack of space, there was no housing or siege yards, and even the cathedral church was supposed to be taken out. However, at this small fortress there was a large garrison - 666 households of service people. These courtyards were reliably protected by the second line of fortifications by a standing prison on taras with 25 towers covered with earth; behind the prison was a moat, and beyond the moat there were stakes. Voronezh was a typical military settlement ([[Ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vrnplus.ru/chrono43|title=Хронология Воронежа, год 1615|lang=ru|accessdate=2023-10-25}}</ref> In the city prison there were only settlements of military men: Streletskaya, Kazachya, Belomestnaya atamanskaya, Zatinnaya and Pushkarskaya.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nashahistory.ru/materials/povsednevnaya-zhizn-voronezha-v-pervoy-polovine-xvii-veka|title=ПОВСЕДНЕВНАЯ ЖИЗНЬ ВОРОНЕЖА В ПЕРВОЙ ПОЛОВИНЕ XVII ВЕКА|date=May 16, 2016 |lang=ru|accessdate=2023-10-22}}</ref> The posad population received the territory between the [[Ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]] and the river, where the Monastyrskaya settlements (at the Assumption Monastery) was formed. Subsequently, the Yamnaya Sloboda was added to them, and on the other side of the fort, on the Chizhovka Mountain, the Chizhovskaya Sloboda of archers and Cossacks appeared. As a result, the Voronezh settlements surrounded the fortress in a ring. The location of the parish churches emphasized this ring-like and even distribution of settlements: the Ilyinsky Church of the Streletskaya Sloboda, the Pyatnitskaya Cossack and Pokrovskaya Belomestnaya were brought out to the passage towers of the prison. The Nikolskaya Church of the Streletskaya Sloboda was located near the marketplace (and, accordingly, the front facade of the fortress), and the paired ensemble of the Rozhdestvenskaya and Georgievskaya churches of the Cossack Sloboda marked the main street of the city, going from the Cossack Gate to the fortress tower.<ref>Urban planning of the Moscow state in the 16th - 17th centuries. pp.82-85</ref>

In 1682, the Voronezh diocese was formed to fight the schismatics. Its first head was Bishop [[Mitrophan of Voronezh|Mitrofan]] (1623-1703) at the age of 58. Under him, the construction began on the new Annunciation Cathedral to replace the old one. In 1832, Mitrofan was [[canonized|glorified]] as a saint by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

In the 1990s, many Orthodox churches were returned to the diocese. Their restoration was continued. In 2009, instead of the lost one, a new Annunciation Cathedral was built with a monument to St. Mitrofan erected next to it.
