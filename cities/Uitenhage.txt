It is well known for the [[Volkswagen]] factory located there, which is the biggest car factory on the [[Africa]]n continent. Along with the city of [[Port Elizabeth]] and the small town of [[Despatch, Eastern Cape|Despatch]], it forms the [[Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality]].

==History==

Uitenhage was founded on 25 April 1804 by ''[[landdrost]]'' (district magistrate) [[Jacob Glen Cuyler]] and named in honour of the Cape's [[Commissioner-General]] [[Jacob Abraham Uitenhage de Mist]] by the [[Dutch Cape Colony]] governor, [[Jan Willem Janssens]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/chronology/thisday/1804-04-25.htm|title=Uitenhage is founded|publisher=sahistory|access-date=14 February 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015081530/http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/chronology/thisday/1804-04-25.htm|archive-date=15 October 2009}}</ref> Uitenhage formed part of the district of [[Graaff Reinet]] (shortly after its short-lived secession).

The [[Cape Colony]] received a degree of independence when "[[Responsible Government]]" was declared in 1872. In 1875, the [[Cape Colony|Cape]] government of [[John Molteno]] took over the rudimentary Uitenhage railway site, incorporated it into the [[Cape Government Railways]] (CGR), and began construction of the lines connecting Uitenhage to [[Port Elizabeth]] and the [[Southern Africa]]n interior. Two years later in [[1877 in South Africa|1877]], Uitenhage was declared a municipality.<ref>Burman, Jose (1984), ''Early Railways at the Cape''. Cape Town: Human & Rousseau, p.66. {{ISBN|0-7981-1760-5}}</ref>

Nearly a hundred years later, as part of the Republic of South Africa, Uitenhage became a centre for resistance against apartheid. In 1985, police opened fire on a funeral procession in Uitenhage, killing a number of unarmed people, in an event that became notorious as an example of police oppression in [[South Africa under apartheid]].<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=645077|pages=217–236|last1=Thornton|first1=R.

In [[2001 in South Africa|2001]] it was incorporated with Port Elizabeth and Despatch into the [[Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality]]. On 23 February 2021, [[Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture]], [[Nathi Mthethwa]] approved and gazetted the decision to rename Uitenhage to Kariega along with the neighbouring city of Port Elizabeth, which was renamed Gqeberha.<ref>{{Cite web |date=23 February 2021 |title=It is Official, Port Elizabeth Has a New Name — Gqeberha |url=https://www.heraldlive.co.za/news/2021-02-23-breaking-it-is-official-port-elizabeth-has-a-new-name-gqeberha/ |access-date=2021-02-24 |website=HeraldLIVE |language=en-ZA}}</ref>

==Geography==

Kariega is situated on the banks of the [[Swartkops River]], approximately 30 kilometres (18.6 miles) north-west of [[Gqeberha]]. Kariega, along with the city of Gqeberha, the neighbouring town of [[Despatch, Eastern Cape|Despatch]], the adjoining [[township]] of [[KwaNobuhle]] and surrounding areas, form the [[Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Distance Port-Elizabeth, Nelson-Mandela-Bay, Eastern-Cape, ZAF > Uitenhage, Nelson-Mandela-Bay-Metropolitan-Municipality, Eastern-Cape, ZAF - Air line, driving route, midpoint|url=https://www.distance.to/Port-Elizabeth,Nelson-Mandela-Bay,Eastern-Cape,ZAF/Uitenhage,Nelson-Mandela-Bay-Metropolitan-Municipality,Eastern-Cape,ZAF|access-date=2020-08-09|website=www.distance.to|language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Port Elizabeth Map {{!}} South Africa Google Satellite Maps |url=http://www.maplandia.com/south-africa/eastern-cape/peddie/port-elizabeth/ |access-date=2020-08-09 |website=www.maplandia.com}}</ref>

Kariega also lies at the start of the Mohair Route which leads along Route 75 towards [[Graaff-Reinet]] (the centre for [[Mohair|mohair farming]] in South Africa), 228 kilometres to the northwest via [[Jansenville]] on [[R75 (South Africa)|Route 75]].

==Industries==

Kariega is known for the large industries situated there.  The largest of these industries are the [[Volkswagen of South Africa]] and [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] factories.  An [[automotive industry|automotive]] supplier park, Alexander Park Industrial, has also been created directly next to the Volkswagen factory, thus allowing [[list of auto parts|automotive component]] manufacturers to construct their manufacturing plants close by. Other industries of note are the food processing giant, Sovereign Foods, located in Kruisrivier industrial area and The Nelson Mandela Bay Logistics Park which hosts several other industries, including Fauricia. These industries are heavily interlinked.

== Transport ==

The [[R75 (South Africa)|R75 highway]], also known as Route 75, bypasses Kariega to the east, heading north–south from [[Graaff-Reinet]] to [[Gqeberha]] with interchanges at the M19, M6, R334 and Graaff-Reinet Road. The [[R334 (South Africa)|R334]] connects Kariega with [[Coega]] to the east and with [[KwaNobuhle]] and the [[R102 (South Africa)|R102]] (near [[Van Stadens Pass]]) to the south-west.

The town is also intersected by [[Metropolitan routes in Port Elizabeth|metropolitan routes]] such as the [[M6 (Port Elizabeth)|M6]] (Caledon Street; Union Avenue) to [[Despatch, South Africa|Despatch]] in the east, the [[M10 (Port Elizabeth)|M10]] (Durban Street; Algoa Road) to [[Bethelsdorp]] in the south-west, the [[M19 (Port Elizabeth)|M19]] (Botha Street) to Despatch and the [[M26 (Port Elizabeth)|M22]] (Marconi Street; Mel Brooks Avenue) to KwaNobuhle in the south.

==Coats of arms==

'''Drostdy''' — In 1804, the Cape colonial government assigned the shield of [[Jacob Abraham Uitenhage de Mist]]'s arms to the new Uitenhage drostdy.  The arms were ''Sable, a cross moline Argent'', i.e. a silver cross moline on a black shield.  An anchor was placed behind the shield.<ref name=lv>Pama, C. (1965)  ''Lions and Virgins''.</ref>  The British authorities discontinued the drostdy seals in 1814, and replaced them with the royal coat of arms.<ref name=ctg>''Cape Town Gazette'' 418 (15 January 1814).</ref>

'''Municipality''' — In 1881, the Uitenhage municipal council adopted the De Mist arms, complete with a crest consisting of a cross moline issuing from a gold coronet.<ref name=cig>The arms were depicted on a [http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Category:UTC_South_African_town_arms cigarette card] issued in 1931.</ref>  The arms were registered with the Cape Provincial Administration in September 1956<ref name=og1>Cape of Good Hope ''Official Gazette'' 2833 (28 September 1956).</ref> and at the [[Bureau of Heraldry]] in June 1994.<ref name=boh>{{Cite web|url=http://www.national.archsrch.gov.za/sm300cv/smws/sm300dl|title=National Archives of South Africa (NASA) Database Selection|website=www.national.archsrch.gov.za}}</ref>

'''Divisional council''' — The Uitenhage divisional council (the local authority for the rural areas outside the town) assumed a coat of arms in 1968.  The arms were granted by the provincial administrator in August 1968<ref name=og2>Cape of Good Hope ''Official Gazette'' 3470 (9 August 1968).</ref> and registered at the [[Bureau of Heraldry]] in June 1972.<ref name=boh />

On the arms were stated: "Or, a triple crowned [[tree]] Vert, the trunk entwined with the Batavian tricolour; on a chief wavy Sable a cross moline  between  dexter  a  pickaxe and hammer in saltire, handles downwards and sinister two scrolls in saltire, Argent." In layman's terms, the design was a golden shield displaying, from top to bottom, a crossed pickaxe and hammer, a cross moline and two crossed scrolls on a black horizontal strip with a wavy edge, and a triple-crowned tree with a [[Batavian Republic]] flag wrapped around it.

The crest was an [[African elephant|elephant]], and the motto ''Per laborem ad honorem''.
