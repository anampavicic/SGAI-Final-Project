With its capital at [[Shenyang]], it is located on the northern shore of the [[Yellow Sea]], and is the northernmost coastal province of the [[China|People's Republic of China]].

{{anchor|Fengtian Province}}
Historically a gateway between [[China proper]] and [[Manchuria]], the modern Liaoning province was established in 1907 as '''Fengtian''' or '''Fengtien''' province and was renamed Liaoning in 1929. It was also known at that time as '''Mukden''' Province for the [[Manchu language|Manchu]] name of ''Shengjing'', the former name of Shenyang. Under the Japanese-puppet [[Manchukuo]] regime, the province reverted to its 1907 name, but the name Liaoning was restored for a brief time in 1945 and then again in 1954.

Liaoning borders the [[Yellow Sea]] ([[Korea Bay]]) and [[Bohai Sea]] in the south, [[North Korea]]'s [[North Pyongan]] and [[Chagang]] provinces in the southeast, [[Jilin]] to the northeast, [[Hebei]] to the southwest, and [[Inner Mongolia]] to the northwest. The [[Yalu River]] marks the [[China–North Korea border|province's border with North Korea]], emptying into the [[Korea Bay]] between [[Dandong]] in Liaoning and [[Sinuiju]] in North Korea. Liaoning is also one of China's leading provinces in research and education. As of 2023, two major cities in Liaoning ranked in the world's top 200 cities ([[Dalian]] 37th and [[Shenyang]] 124th) by scientific research output, as tracked by [[Nature Index]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Leading 200 science cities 2023{{!}} {{!}} Supplements  |url=https://www.nature.com/nature-index/supplements/nature-index-2023-science-cities/tables/overall |access-date=2024-01-19 |website=Nature Index }}</ref>

== Name ==
Liaoning is named after the [[Liao River]] that runs through the province. ''Ning'' ([[:wiktionary:宁|宁]], "peace") is used frequently in Chinese place names including [[Ningxia]], [[Xining]] and [[Nanning]]. The current name was first adopted in 1929, and restored in 1954 upon the merging of the [[Liaoxi]] ("West Liao") and [[Liaodong]] ("East Liao") provinces.

== History ==
Prior to 3rd century BC, [[Donghu people|Donghu]], [[Gojoseon]] and [[Yemaek]] peoples inhabited Liaoning.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lydaw.gov.cn/xpsh/NewsInfo.asp?id=57 |script-title=zh:先秦辽阳地区部族问题初探 |website=lydaw.gov.cn |access-date=2011-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707035836/http://www.lydaw.gov.cn/xpsh/NewsInfo.asp?id=57 |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[state of Yan]] conquered the area around 300 BC. Two commanderies, [[Liaodong Commandery|Liaodong]] ("east of the [[Liao River]]") and [[Liaoxi Commandery|Liaoxi]] ("west of the Liao River"), were established within the Liaoning region. The Yan city of [[Xiangping]], the center of Liaodong, was located on the site of the present [[Liaoyang]] city.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Byington |first1=Mark E. |title=The Ancient State of Puyŏ in Northeast Asia: Archaeology and Historical Memory |date=2020 |publisher=Brill |isbn=9781684175673 |page=44 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L3vnDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA44}}</ref> As [[End of the Han dynasty|the Han dynasty fell]], warlord [[Gongsun Du]] and his family established and maintained a semi-independent state based in Liaodong, until it was defeated by [[Cao Wei]] in 238.

In 436, as [[Northern Wei]] seized the Yan capital, [[Liaodong Peninsula]] was taken over by [[Goguryeo]]. The [[Tang dynasty]] annexed the region during the [[Goguryeo–Tang War]]. However, when the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] drained Tang's resources away from its frontiers, [[Balhae|Bohai]] gradually expanded into Liaodong. Eventually, Liaoning was conquered by the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao dynasty]], followed by the [[Jurchens|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] and the [[Mongol Empire]].

Around 1442, a defense wall was constructed to defend the agricultural heartland of the province from a potential threat from the Jurchen-Mongol [[Uriankhai|Oriyanghan]] (who were Ming's tributaries) from the northwest. Between 1467 and 1468, the wall was expanded to protect the region from the northeast as well, against attacks from [[Jianzhou Jurchens]] (who were later to become known as the [[Manchu people]]). Although similar in purpose to the [[Great Wall of China]], this "Liaodong Wall" was of a lower-cost design. While stones and tiles were used in some parts, most of the wall was in fact simply an earth dike with moats on both sides.<ref name=edmonds38>{{cite book|title=Northern Frontiers of Qing China and Tokugawa Japan: A Comparative Study of Frontier Policy|first=Richard Louis|last=Edmonds|publisher=University of Chicago, Department of Geography; Research Paper No. 213|isbn=0-89065-118-3|year=1985|pages=38–40}}</ref>

Despite the Liaodong Wall, the [[Manchu people|Jurchens]] conquered Liaodong, or eastern Liaoning, in the early 17th century, decades before the rest of China fell to them. The Jurchen dynasty, styled "[[Later Jin (1616–1636)|Later Jin]]" before being renamed to [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], established its capital in 1616–1621 in [[Hetu Ala|Xingjing]] ({{zh|s=兴京|labels=no}}), which was located outside of the Liaodong Wall in the eastern part of the modern Liaoning Province.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://history.cultural-china.com/en/46H2732H7936.html |title=Xingjing |access-date=2009-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304204254/http://history.cultural-china.com/en/46H2732H7936.html |archive-date=2010-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was moved to Dongjing (east of today's [[Liaoyang]], Liaoning),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://history.cultural-china.com/en/46H2732H7937.html |title=Dongjing |access-date=2009-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304204303/http://history.cultural-china.com/en/46H2732H7937.html |archive-date=2010-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=edmonds113>Edmonds (1985), p. 113</ref> and finally in 1625 to [[Shengjing]] (now, [[Shenyang]], Liaoning). Although the main Qing capital was moved from Shengjing to [[Beijing]] after it fell to the Qing in 1644, Shengjing retained its importance as a regional capital throughout most of the Qing era.

The Qing conquest of Liaoning resulted in a significant population loss in the area, as many local Chinese residents were either killed during fighting, or fled south of the [[Great Wall]], many cities being destroyed by the retreating Ming forces themselves. As late as 1661, the Civil Governor (''Fuyin'') of Fengtian Province, [[Zhang Shangxian]] reported that, outside of Fengtian City (Shenyang), [[Liaoyang]], and [[Haicheng, Liaoning|Haicheng]], all other cities east of the [[Liaohe|Liao River]] were either abandoned, or hardly had a few hundred residents left. In the Governor's words, "[[Tieling]] and [[Fushun]] only have a few vagrants". West of the Liao, only [[Xingcheng|Ningyuan]], [[Jinzhou]], and [[Beizhen|Guangning]] had any significant populations remaining.<ref>Edmonds (1985), p. 74</ref>

This map, published in 1734, was based on data collected by [[Jesuit missions in China|Jesuits]] in the early 18th century. The capital is in Shenyang (''Chinyang''); most other cities mentioned in Governor Zhang's report are shown as well]]
In the latter half of the seventeenth century (starting with laws issued in 1651 and 1653), the imperial Qing government recruited migrants from south of the Great Wall (notably, from [[Shandong]]) to settle the relatively sparsely populated area of Fengtian Province (roughly corresponding to today's Liaoning).<ref>Edmonds (1985), pp. 74–75</ref> Many of the current residents of Liaoning trace their ancestry to these seventeenth century settlers. The rest of China's Northeast, however, remained officially off-limits to [[Han Chinese]] for most of the Manchu era. To prevent the migration of Chinese to those regions (today's [[Jilin]] and [[Heilongjiang]], as well as the adjacent parts of [[Inner Mongolia]]), the so-called [[Willow Palisade]] was constructed ({{Circa|1638|1672}}). The Palisade encircled the agricultural heartlands of Fengtian, running in most areas either somewhat outside the old Ming Liaodong Wall, or reusing it, and separating it from the Manchu forests to the northeast and the Mongol grazing lands to the northwest.<ref name=edmonds58>Edmonds (1985), pp. 58–61</ref>

Later on, the Qing government tried to stop the migrants flow to Fengtian or even to make some settlers return to their original places of residence – or, failing that, to legalize them. For example, an edict issued in 1704 commented on the recent Han Chinese settlers in Fengtian having failed to comply with earlier orders requiring them to leave, and asked them either to properly register and join a local defense group ({{zh|s=保|hp=bao|labels=no}}), or to leave the province for their original places within the next ten years. Ten years later, naturally, another edict appeared, reminding of the necessity to do something with illegal migrants ...<ref name=edmonds76>Edmonds (1985), p. 76</ref> In any event, the restrictive policy was not as effective as desired by the officials in Beijing, and Fengtian's population doubled between 1683 and 1734.<ref name=edmonds76/>

During the Qing Dynasty, Manchuria was ruled by three generals, one of whom, the General of [[Shengjing]] (Mukden i Jiyanggiyūn) ruled much of modern Liaoning. In 1860, the Manchu government began to reopen the region to migration, which quickly resulted in [[Han Chinese]] becoming the dominant ethnic group in the region.

In the 20th century, the province of Fengtian was set up in what is Liaoning today. When [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] fought the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1904–1905, many key battles took place in Liaoning, including the [[Battle of Port Arthur]] and the [[Battle of Mukden]], which was, to that point, the largest land battle ever fought. During the [[Warlord Era]] in the early twentieth century, Liaoning was under the [[Fengtian clique]], including [[Zhang Zuolin]] and his son [[Chang Hsueh-liang|Zhang Xueliang]]. The province first received its present name on January 29, 1929; the [[Sino-Soviet conflict (1929)|Zhongdong Railway Incident]] took place later that year. In 1931, Japan invaded and the area came under the rule of the [[Japan]]ese-controlled [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]]. The [[Chinese Civil War]] that took place following Japanese defeat in 1945 had its first major battles (the [[Liaoshen Campaign]]) in and around Liaoning.

At the founding of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] in 1949, Liaoning did not exist; instead there were two provinces, [[Liaodong]] and [[Liaoxi]], as well as five [[municipality of China|municipalities]], Shenyang, Lüda (present-day [[Dalian]]), [[Anshan]], [[Fushun]], and [[Benxi]]. These were all merged into "Liaoning" in 1954, and parts of former [[Rehe (province)|Rehe]] province were merged into Liaoning in 1955. During the [[Cultural Revolution]] Liaoning also took in a part of [[Inner Mongolia]], though this was reversed later.

Liaoning was one of the first provinces in China to industrialize, first under Japanese occupation, and then even more in the 1950s and 1960s. The city of Anshan, for example, is home to one of the largest iron and steel complexes in China. In recent years, this early focus on [[heavy industry]] has become a liability, as many of the large state-run enterprises have experienced economic difficulties. Recognizing the special difficulties faced by Liaoning and other provinces in Northeast China because of their heritage of heavy industry, the Chinese central government recently launched a "[[Revitalize the Northeast]]" Campaign.

== Geography ==
[[Image:Liaoning L7 2000-10-02.jpg|thumb|[[Landsat 7]] image of western Liaoning]]
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}
{{expand section|date=July 2014}}
It is possible to think of Liaoning as three approximate geographical regions: the highlands in the west, [[plain]]s in the middle, and hills in the east.

The highlands in the west are dominated by the [[Nulu'erhu Mountains]], which roughly follow the border between Liaoning and [[Inner Mongolia]]. The entire region is dominated by low hills. A narrow strip of coastal plains, known as the [[Liaoxi Corridor]], connects the Liao River Basin to the [[North China Plain]], ending at the [[Shanhai Pass]] of the [[Great Wall]].

The central part of Liaoning consists of a basin drained by rivers such as the [[Liao River|Liao]], [[Daliao River|Daliao]], and their tributaries. This region is mostly flat and low-lying. 

The eastern part of Liaoning is dominated by the Changbai Mountains and Qianshan Mountains which extend into the sea to form the [[Liaodong Peninsula]]. The highest point in Liaoning, [[Mount Huabozi]] (1336&nbsp;m), is found in this region.

Liaoning has a [[continental climate|continental]] [[monsoon]] climate, and [[rainfall]] averages to about 440 to 1130&nbsp;mm annually. Summer is rainy while the other seasons are dry.

== Paleontology ==
{{main|Jehol Biota}}
Liaoning contains some of the foremost paleontological sites in the world. Known collectively as the [[Jehol Group]], they include the [[Yixian Formation]], [[Jiufotang Formation]] and [[Tiaojishan Formation]]. The name ''[[Jehol Province|Jehol]]'' derives from a now defunct provincial division of that name, which covered an area that is now Western Liaoning, Eastern Hebei, and a small part of Inner Mongolia. Fossils were first found there during the 1920s. During the Japanese occupation of the area through the 1930s and early 1940s, more fossils were found, but records of them were lost after World War II ended. The area remained relatively unexplored until the 1990s. It was in 1996 that Liaoning made the headlines with the announcement of the discovery of ''[[Sinosauropteryx prima]]'', the first example of a filamented "feathered" [[dinosaur]]. ''Sinosauropteryx prima'' was a small feathered meat-eating dinosaur, from the [[Lower Cretaceous]] [[Yixian Formation]].<ref name="Chen1998">Chen, P-J., Dong, Z-M., Zhen, S-N. 1998. An exceptionally well-preserved theropod dinosaur from the Yixian Formation of China. Nature. Vol. 391:14.–152.</ref> This discovery pushed the evolution of feathers back in time and showed that dinosaurs, not only birds, had feathers.

== Politics ==
{{Main|Politics of Liaoning|List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China}}

The politics of Liaoning is structured in a [[One-party state|single party-government system]] like all other governing institutions in mainland China. The Governor of Liaoning ({{zh|s=辽宁省省长|labels=no}}) is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Liaoning. However, in the province's single party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the [[Chinese Communist Party]] Liaoning Provincial Committee Secretary ({{zh|s=辽宁省委书记|labels=no}} for short), colloquially termed the "Liaoning Party Chief".

Prior to 1949 and the [[Chinese Communist Revolution]], Liaoning was governed by the [[Fengtian clique]] of warlords and interchangeably officials of the [[Chiang Kai-shek]] bureaucracy. During the [[Qing Dynasty]] Liaoning was known as the province of '''Fengtian''' ({{zh|c=奉天|labels=no}}), and was governed by a zǒngdū or Viceroy (The Viceroy of the Three Eastern Provinces, {{zh|labels=no |s=东三省总督}}), along with the provinces of [[Jilin]] and [[Heilongjiang]]. The province itself also had a governor ({{zh|s=巡抚|p=xúnfǔ|labels=no}}).

==Administrative divisions==
{{main|List of administrative divisions of Liaoning|List of township-level divisions of Liaoning}}
Liaoning is divided into fourteen [[Administrative divisions of China#Prefectural level|prefecture-level divisions]], all [[Prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]] (including two [[Sub-provincial divisions in the People's Republic of China|sub-provincial cities]]):

Liaoning has the largest and wealthiest provincial economy of Northeast China. Its [[nominal GDP]] for 2017 was 2.39 trillion yuan (ca. US$354 billion), making it the 14th largest in China (out of 31 provinces). Its per capita GDP was 54,745 yuan (US$8,108). Among the three provinces of [[Northeast China]], Liaoning is the largest in terms of GDP and GDP per capita.

In 2008, Liaoning was the region with the highest GDP growth among global [https://web.archive.org/web/20100701081702/http://velopment.de/wiki/Executive_Introduction#Global_Number_One_Growth_Province G8x8], the eight provinces or states below national level with the highest GDP of the top eight GDP nations. According to preliminary statistics, Liaoning maintained its GDP growth rate of 13.1 percent in 2009 and held its position as the province with the highest economic growth. Economic growth has since slowed down, with the economy expanding 3% in 2015 and contracting 1.3% in the first quarter of 2016.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Leading industries include petrochemicals, metallurgy, electronics telecommunications, and machinery.<ref name="thechinaperspective.com">{{Cite web |url=http://thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/liaoning-province/ |title=Liaoning Province: Economic News and Statistics for Liaoning's Economy |access-date=2011-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008045442/http://thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/liaoning-province/ |archive-date=2011-10-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On a national level, Liaoning is a major producer of pig iron, steel and metal-cutting machine tools, all of whose production rank among the top three in the nation. Liaoning is one of the most important raw materials production bases in China. Industries such as mining, quarrying, smelting and pressing of ferrous metals, petroleum and natural gas extraction, are all of great significance.

Meanwhile, Liaoning is an important production base of equipment and machinery manufacturing, with Shenyang and Dalian being the industrial centers. Enterprises such as Shenyang Jinbei Co. Ltd., Daxian Group Co. Ltd., and Shenyang Machine Tool Co. Ltd., are leaders in their sectors. The province's light industry mainly focuses on textiles and clothing industries which include cotton and wool spinning, chemical fiber production, knitting, silk production, and the manufacturing of both garments and textile machinery.

In 2008, its tertiary industry accounted for 34.5 percent of total GDP. In the future, Liaoning will continue its efforts to restructure large and medium-sized state enterprises. Meanwhile, the province will concentrate in developing its four pillar industries – petrochemicals, metallurgy, machinery and electronics.

Liaoning is the place of origin of the [[Li Keqiang index]], an alternative measure of economic performance where GDP figures are unreliable.

=== Agriculture===
Main [[agriculture|agricultural]] products of Liaoning include [[maize]], [[sorghum]], and [[soybean]]s. The region around [[Dalian]] produces three-quarters of China's exported [[apple]]s and [[peach]]es. [[Cotton]] is also produced.

Liaoning's fruits include apples from Dalian and [[Yingkou]], golden peaches from Dalian, [[pear]]s from Beizhen of [[Jinzhou]], white pears from [[Huludao]] and Suizhong, and [[apricot]]s and [[plum]]s from Gushan of [[Dandong]].

===Mining===

===Regional development strategies===

====Central Liaoning City Cluster (Shenyang Metro Area)====
The Central Liaoning city cluster is a [[Megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]] centered on [[Shenyang]] (urban population 4 million). Within its {{convert|150|km|abbr=on}} radius, it includes [[Anshan]] (urban population 1.3 million), [[Fushun]] (1.3 million), [[Yingkou]] (1.1 million), [[Benxi]] (0.95 million), [[Liaoyang]] (0.7 million), and [[Tieling]] (0.4 million).

In April 2010, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]] approved a national development strategy for the Shenyang Metro Area. The core of this strategy is innovation in industrial development, integration of the eight cities, integration of urban and rural areas as well as the promotion of more market-oriented development.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://velopment.de/wiki/Investment_in_Liaoning |title=China Liaoning Business Guide |access-date=2010-08-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701081708/http://velopment.de/wiki/Investment_in_Liaoning#Development_of_the_Shenyang_Metropolitan_Area |archive-date=2010-07-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

====Liaoning Coastal Economic Belt====
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2023}}
The [[Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary]] of Liaoning, [[Li Keqiang]], initiated the development of a strategy entitled "5 Points and One Line", which he first proposed on a visit to [[Yingkou]] in late 2005. Liaoning Province formally launched the development strategy for the entire Liaoning coastline in early 2006, so as to re-invigorate the provincial economy from its traditional status as a "rustbelt" of Chinese state-owned enterprises.

The "Five Points" indicate five key development areas in the province and cover seven zones: the Changxing Island Harbor Industrial Zone in
[[Dalian]]; [[Yingkou]] Coastal Industrial Base; Liaoxi [[Jinzhou]] Bay Coastal Economic Zone; [[Dandong]], and the Zhuanghe Huayuankou Industrial Zone.

The five zones together cover a planned area of nearly {{convert|500|km2}}.

The "One Line" mentioned in the strategy represents a new series of motorways along the coast. The 1,433-kilometer coastline will become the connection between the five above zones, through which 6 provincial cities, 21 counties and 113 towns will be interlinked. Coastal motorways directly connect the entire string of five zones along the Bohai sea.

According to a 2012 survey,<ref name="CFPS2012"/> only around 10% of the population of Liaoning belongs to organised religions, the largest groups being [[Buddhism in China|Buddhists]] with 5.5%, followed by [[Protestantism in China|Protestants]] with 2.2%, [[Islam in China|Muslims]] with 0.6% and [[Catholicism in China|Catholics]] with 0.2%.
[[File:Jade Buddha Palace in Anshan.jpg|thumb|Jade Buddha Temple in [[Anshan]]]]

The reports did not give figures for other types of religion; around 90% of the population may be either irreligious or involved in [[Chinese folk religion]]s (cults of nature deities and ancestors), [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk religious sects]].

The significant [[Manchu people|Manchu]] population, although strongly assimilated to the [[Han Chinese]] and practicing Chinese religions, also retains its own pure [[Manchu shamanism]]. At the same time, the [[Dongbei folk religion|local religion of the Han people throughout Manchuria]] has developed patterns of deities, ideas, and practices inherited from Manchu and [[Tungusic peoples|Tungus]] shamanism, making it quite different from central and southern Chinese folk religion. The [[Mongols in China|Mongol]] ethnic minority either follows the [[Mongolian folk religion]] and shamanism, or [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

== Tourism ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2023}}[[Image:Mukden palace Chongzheng Hall 04.jpg|thumb|right|Chongzheng Hall in the Mukden Palace]]
The [[Mukden Palace]] was the palace of the [[Qing Dynasty]] emperors before they conquered the rest of China and moved their capital to [[Beijing]]. Though not as large nor as well known as its counterpart (the [[Forbidden City]]) in Beijing, the Mukden palace is significant for its representation of palace architecture at the time, and has recently been included on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] as an extension of the Imperial Palace site in Beijing.

In addition, three imperial tombs dating from the Qing Dynasty are located in Liaoning. These tomb sites have been grouped with other [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and Qing Dynasties tombs (such as the [[Ming Dynasty Tombs]] in Beijing, and the [[Ming Xiaoling|Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum]] in [[Nanjing]]) as a combined UNESCO World Heritage Site.

[[Wunu Mountain City]], a [[Goguryeo]] site found in [[Huanren Manchu autonomous county|Huanren Manchu Autonomous County]], is part of a combined [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] that also includes sites in [[Ji'an, Jilin|Ji'an]], [[Jilin]].

[[Benxi]] offers a boat ride through a large [[stalactite]] filled cave and underground river.

[[Anshan]] hosts the [[Jade Buddha Palace]], the largest [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] statue made of [[jade]] in the world.

[[Liaoyang]], one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in northeast China, has a number of historical sites, including the White Pagoda (Baita), that dates to the [[Yuan Dynasty]].

The port city of [[Dalian]], located on the tip of the [[Liaodong Peninsula]], is a tourist destination in its own right, with beaches, resorts, zoos, seafood, shopping, Russian- and Japanese-era heritage architecture, and [[streetcar]]s, a rare sight in China.

[[Dandong]], on the border with [[North Korea]], is a medium-sized city that offers a cross-river view of the North Korean city of [[Sinuiju|Sinŭiju]].

[[Bijia Mountain]] is an island which joins to the mainland at low tide by a land bridge.

== Education and research ==
Liaoning is also one of China's leading provinces in research and education. As of 2023, two major cities in Liaoning ranked in the world's top 200 cities (Dalian 37th and Shenyang 124th) by scientific research output, as tracked by [[Nature Index]].<ref name=":0" />
