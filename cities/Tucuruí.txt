The city is served by [[Tucuruí Airport]].

The name Tucuruí is a Tupi word that means "river of ants" or "river of locusts". It's the concatenation of two tupi words: tukura (ants, locusts) and 'y (water).
The city is very famous because of its colossal Dam, the [[Tucuruí Dam]] which is administered by Eletrobrás Eletronorte – the constructor company of this large infrastructure project.

==Economy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2023}}
Currently, Tucuruí city's economy is based on agriculture and general commerce. During its 60 years the commerce activity varied a lot. In the beginning there was a railroad for draining out the production of the Brazil Nut (known in Brazil as "Pará's Nut"), a very abundant available product in the region. The Tucuruí Dam developed the municipality and brought large industries for the region.

Inside the Cultural Center, visits to the inside the hydroelectric dam to see its workings are scheduled. In February there is the Tucuruí carnival party, one of the most known in region. In June, there is the Tucunaré's festival (Cichla Festival), when traditional preparations of fish are served.

==Gastronomy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2023}}
Tucuruí has a privileged lake with many species of fish. Naturally, the local gastronomy has much fish in it. The most known is the Peixe no Saco (Fish in the Bag). The Peixe no Saco is a preparation of Chichla or Tambaqui with a wide variety of spices and herbs placed within the fish's stomach. The fish is then placed on a special waterproof bag with soy sauce and roasted in oven or in firewood.

Other gastronomic options include indigenous food. There is the Tacacá (a broth made of [[tucupi]], jambu [a native variety of paracress], starch and shrimp served in a gourd usually to drink without spoon or fork. There is just a toothpick for eating the shrimp and the herbs) and the [[Vatapá]] and [[maniçoba]].
