==History==
Gilbert was established by William "Bobby" Gilbert, who provided land to the [[Arizona Eastern Railway]] in 1902 to construct a rail line between Phoenix and [[Florence, Arizona]]. Ayer's Grocery Store, Gilbert's first store, opened in 1910 and became the location of the first post office in 1912. The post office moved several times before settling on the east side of Gilbert Road in downtown, where it stands today. In 1912, many Mormons who had fled the [[Mormon colonies in Mexico]] due to the actions of [[Pancho Villa]]'s forces settled in Gilbert. By 1915, they began holding church meetings at the Gilbert Elementary School. In 1918, they were organized into the Gilbert Ward.<ref>{{Cite news |date=November 19, 2010 |title=Gilbert Arizona Community's roots date to 1920 |url=https://www.thechurchnews.com/archive/2010-11-19/gilbert-arizona-communitys-roots-date-to-1920-36358 |access-date=September 4, 2012 |work=[[Church News]]}}</ref>

Incorporated on July 6, 1920, Gilbert was primarily a farming community fueled by the rail line and construction of the [[Roosevelt Dam]] and the Eastern and Consolidated Canals. It remained an agricultural town for many years and was known as the "Hay Capital of the World"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gilbert History |url=http://www.ci.gilbert.az.us/busdev/profile/history.cfm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417155420/http://www.ci.gilbert.az.us/busdev/profile/history.cfm |archive-date=April 17, 2010 |access-date=September 4, 2012 |publisher=Ci.gilbert.az.us}}</ref> from 1911 until the late 1920s.

===9/11 Memorial===
Gilbert Town Hall is home to a 9/11 Memorial<ref>{{Cite web |title=Town Hall {{!}} Town of Gilbert, Arizona |url=https://www.gilbertaz.gov/departments/town-hall |access-date=February 28, 2020 |website=www.gilbertaz.gov}}</ref> that features an eight-foot steel girder beam<ref>{{Citation |last=Atridim |first=Captain Rick |title=9-11 Memorial in Gilbert Arizona |date=September 25, 2011 |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/atridim/8209572942/ |access-date=February 28, 2020}}</ref> that held up the North Tower of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]].{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} Former Gilbert Fire Chief Collin DeWitt raised money for three years to create the memorial and bring the beam from New York City to Arizona. He drove to collect it himself along with then Assistant Fire Chief Jim Jobusch.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gilbert Digital Newsroom {{!}} Town of Gilbert, Arizona |url=https://www.gilbertaz.gov/Home/Components/News/News/296/ |access-date=February 28, 2020 |website=www.gilbertaz.gov}}</ref>

The memorial's design angles the beam, putting it in reach of everyone. Four granite walls bear the names of those killed in the attacks. Concrete was poured in the shape of a pentagon for the memorial's foundation,<ref>{{Citation |title=9/11 Memorial – Gilbert, Arizona |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiCVN4YTuJY |access-date=February 28, 2020 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/NiCVN4YTuJY |archive-date=November 17, 2021 |url-status=live |language=en}}{{cbignore}}</ref> and is surrounded by bricks that bear the names of some of those who donated to the memorial's creation. The memorial was unveiled in a ceremony on the attacks' 10th anniversary, on September 11, 2011.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Aug. 9 |last2=azcentral.com |first2=2011 11:01 AM The Republic {{!}} |title=Gilbert 9/11 memorial: Work begins on site |url=http://www.azcentral.com/community/gilbert/articles/2011/08/09/20110809gilbert-911-memorial-construction-work-begins.html |access-date=February 28, 2020 |website=azcentral.com}}</ref>

===Historic place===
Gilbert Elementary School was built in 1913, and now houses the Gilbert Historical Museum. It is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Maricopa County, Arizona|National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name="nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com">[https://nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/az/maricopa/state.html National Register of Historic Places Maricopa County, Arizona]</ref>

==Parks and recreation==
The Gilbert Parks and Recreation department provides parks, recreation, and cultural programs for residents and visitors. Gilbert has over 600 acres of open space, 37 park ramadas, four public pools, a riparian area, and over 40 sports fields. Gilbert Parks and Recreation is accredited by the Commission for Accreditation of Park and Recreation Agencies. It is also recognized as a Certified Autism Center by the International Board of Credentialing and Continuing Education Standards (IBCCES).<ref>{{Cite web |date=May 13, 2023 |title=Gilbert Parks and Recreation |url=https://www.gilbertaz.gov/departments/parks-and-recreation}}</ref>  

==Government==

Since Gilbert remains incorporated as a town, it lacks the additional powers possessed by nearby [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]] and [[Chandler, Arizona|Chandler]], which are incorporated as cities. For instance, Arizona towns do not have as much power to regulate utilities and construction within their borders as cities do.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Arizona Revised Statutes §9-276.

==Education==
Most of Gilbert is zoned to schools in the [[Gilbert Public Schools]], while other parts are zoned to districts including the [[Chandler Unified School District]], [[Mesa Public Schools]], and the [[Higley Unified School District]]. Also in Gilbert are charter schools such as Eduprize (the first charter school in Arizona), American Leadership Academy, and Legacy Traditional School. The town is also home to [[Gilbert Christian Schools]], a chain of private schools. In 2018, [[Park University]] opened the [[Park University Gilbert|Gilbert Campus Center]] after leasing {{convert|18000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} at the University Building in the city's Heritage District.<ref name="ParkGilbert2019">{{Cite news |last=Staff |date=April 1, 2020 |title=Park University to expand campus in downtown Gilbert |url=https://ktar.com/story/2680894/park-university-to-expand-campus-in-downtown-gilbert/ |access-date=April 1, 2020 |publisher=KTAR News}}</ref>

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
{{Main|Metropolitan Phoenix Freeways}}
Gilbert is primarily served by one [[Roads and freeways in metropolitan Phoenix|area freeway]]—the Santan Freeway portion of [[Arizona State Route 202|Loop 202]]. A small section of the [[U.S. Route 60 in Arizona|US 60]] Superstition Freeway also skirts Gilbert's northern boundary at the Higley Road interchange (Exit 186). Several regional arterials also serve the area, including Williams Field Road, [[Chandler, Arizona|Chandler]] Boulevard, and Gilbert Road. The town is relatively close to [[Phoenix Mesa Gateway Airport]], in east [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]], and is a 25-minute drive from [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport]].

A [[Park and ride|park-and-ride]] facility is in downtown Gilbert for bus service. Although the facility borders the [[Union Pacific]] (formerly Southern Pacific) tracks and has provisions for commuter rail service, there is currently no such service. Bus service is limited in Gilbert, with some north–south routes in Mesa dead-ending at Baseline Road before entering Gilbert. Routes that serve portions of Gilbert include the 108-Elliot Road, 112-Country Club/Arizona Avenue, 136-Gilbert Road, 140-Ray Road, 156-Chandler Boulevard/Williams Field Road, 184-Power Road, and 531-Mesa/Gilbert Express, with most of these routes operating at 30-minute frequency on weekdays. Sunday service is only available on Routes 108, 112, 156, and 184. Most people get around by car or bike. Gilbert has a low proportion of households without cars. In 2015, 1.9% of Gilbert households lacked a car, and the figure was 1.7% in 2016. The national average in 2016 was 8.7%. Gilbert averaged 2.08 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=December 9, 2014 |title=Car Ownership in U.S. Cities Data and Map |url=http://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html |journal=Governing |access-date=May 4, 2018}}</ref>

In 2018 [[Waymo]] started testing in a small portion of Gilbert's northwest.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Waymo Expanding Chandler Operations Ahead of Launch of Arizona Public Ride Service |url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/tech/2018/08/21/waymo-expands-arizona-footprint-chandler-before-ride-service-start/1046805002/ |journal=The Arizona Republic |access-date=January 7, 2019}}</ref>
