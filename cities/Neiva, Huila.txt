'''Neiva''' ({{IPA|es|ˈnejβa}}) is the capital and most populated city of the [[Department of Huila]], south central [[Colombia]].  It is located in the [[Magdalena River Valley|valley]] of the [[Magdalena River]] with a municipal population of 357,392.<ref name=dane/> It is one of the most important cities in southern Colombia, mainly because of its strategic geographical location.

==History==
Neiva was first founded in 1539 by Juan de Cabrera in an area now belonging to the municipality of [[Campoalegre]]. In 1550, Juan de Alonso y Arias relocated the city to the place that is now the municipality of [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]]. At this location, the city was destroyed by indigenous tribes in 1560. The city was founded, at its current location, for the third and final time in 1612 by Diego de Ospina y Medinilla.

Neiva became important during the colonial times because of its strategic location. It was located in the trade route that communicated the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] with [[Bogotá]] and [[Caracas]]. The city was declared as the capital of the Province of Neiva, made up of the Neiva, [[La Plata, Huila|La Plata]], [[Timaná]], [[Purificación, Tolima|Purificación]] [[Cabildo (council)|cabildos]]. In 1905 the city became the capital of the newly created Huila Department, which had been severed from the [[Tolima Department]] by the national government.

In 1967, the city was hit severely by an [[earthquake]] of magnitude 7.2. The earthquake destroyed several buildings including the ''Palacio de las 57 ventanas'', the Governor's building.

In 2003 the city was the scene of a [[2003 Neiva bombing|large bombing]] that was targeted at the Colombian President. 13 people were killed.

==Geography and climate==
The city has the dry-summer [[tropical savannah climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: '''As'''), relatively rare and scattered across the world.

Due to its location near the [[equator]] and its low altitude, the city has a hot annual average climate with daytime temperatures ranging from 88 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/COXX0037|title=Neiva, Colombia Monthly Weather Forecast - weather.com|website=weather.com|access-date=26 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024185251/http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/COXX0037|archive-date=24 October 2012}}</ref> It is about 300 kilometers / 186.4 miles (about a five-hour drive) from the Colombian capital, [[Bogotá]].

The city of [[Palembang]] in [[Indonesia]] is the [[Antipodes|antipode]] of Neiva.
