Alongside [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], it is one of two traditional [[county seat|seats]] of [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]]. With an estimated population of 115,554 in [[2020 United States census|2020]],<ref name="USCensusEst2020">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/lowellcitymassachusetts/PST045219|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|access-date=August 18, 2021}}</ref> it was the [[List of municipalities in Massachusetts by population|fifth most populous city]] in Massachusetts as of the last census, and the third most populous in the [[Greater Boston|Boston metropolitan statistical area]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/php/usa-metro-bostoncambridgenewtonmanh.php|title=Boston - Cambridge - Newton, MA-NH Metropolitan Statistical Area (USA): Places - Population Statistics in Maps and Charts|access-date=June 17, 2016|archive-date=June 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621050809/http://www.citypopulation.de/php/usa-metro-bostoncambridgenewtonmanh.php|url-status=live}}</ref> The city is also part of a smaller [[Massachusetts statistical area]], called [[Greater Lowell]], and of [[New England]]'s [[Merrimack Valley]] region.

Incorporated in 1826 to serve as a [[mill town]], Lowell was named after [[Francis Cabot Lowell]], a local figure in the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The city became known as the cradle of the [[American Industrial Revolution]] because of [[Lowell mills|its textile mills]] and factories. Many of Lowell's historic manufacturing sites were later preserved by the [[National Park Service]] to create [[Lowell National Historical Park]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/lowe/index.htm |title=Lowell National Historical Park |website=nps.gov |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior |access-date=March 23, 2011 |archive-date=March 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306172337/http://www.nps.gov/lowe/index.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> During the [[Cambodian genocide]] (1975–1979), the city took in an influx of refugees, leading to a [[Cambodia Town]] and America's second-largest [[Cambodian-American]] population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/06/08/monument-lowell-cambodian-community-past-and-its-progress/4YcAuLibteDmMoVyJqaMqM/story.html|title=Monument in Lowell the Cambodian community's past and its progress - The Boston Globe|website=[[The Boston Globe]]|access-date=June 17, 2016|archive-date=August 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806183545/https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/06/08/monument-lowell-cambodian-community-past-and-its-progress/4YcAuLibteDmMoVyJqaMqM/story.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Lowell is home to two [[higher education|institutions of higher education]]. [[UMass Lowell]], part of the [[University of Massachusetts]] system, has three campuses in the city. [[Middlesex Community College (Massachusetts)|Middlesex Community College]]'s two campuses are in Lowell and in the town of [[Bedford, Massachusetts]].  Arts facilities in the city include the [[Whistler House Museum of Art]], the [[Merrimack Repertory Theatre]], the [[Lowell Memorial Auditorium]], and [[Sampas Pavilion]].  In sports, the city has a long tradition of boxing, hosting the annual [[New England Golden Gloves]] boxing tournament.  The city has a baseball stadium, [[Edward A. LeLacheur Park]], and a multipurpose indoor sports arena, the [[Tsongas Center]], both of which have hosted collegiate and minor-league professional sports teams.

{{Main|History of Lowell, Massachusetts|Timeline of Lowell, Massachusetts}}

=== Indigenous and Colonial History ===
The [[Pawtucket Falls (Massachusetts)|Pawtucket Falls]], which provided the hydropower for Lowell's industry in the 1800s, also served as an important seasonal fishing site for native people at the time of European colonization in the 1600s.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Gookin |first=Daniel |url=https://archive.org/details/s1collections01massuoft/page/n197/mode/1up |title=Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society: Gookin's Historical Collection of the Indians in New England |date=1674 |publisher=Boston [etc.] |others=Robarts - University of Toronto |pages=197}}</ref> The [[Pawtucket tribe|Pawtucket]] people are named for this location, literally meaning "at the falls" in [[Massachusett language|Massachusett]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Douglas-Lithgow |first=Robert Alexander |url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofamer00doug/page/142/mode/2up |title=Dictionary of American-Indian place and proper names in New England; with many interpretations, etc. |date=1909 |publisher=Salem, Mass., Salem Press |others=Allen County Public Library Genealogy Center |pages=142}}</ref> 
In the mid-1600s, English efforts to convert native people to Christianity led to the founding of the "[[praying town]]" of [[Wamesit]] at the confluence of the [[Concord River|Concord]] and [[Merrimack River|Merrimack Rivers]] in what is today Lowell,<ref name=":0" /> however the population of Wamesit was reckoned at only 75 people just prior to [[King Philip's War|King Phillip's War]],<ref name=":0" /> which significantly altered relations between English colonists and indigenous groups in New England, and led to the abandonment of many praying towns. By the 1800s, the area that would become Lowell was part of the farming community of East Chelmsford, Massachusetts.

=== Founding and Early Industry ===
Founded in the 1820s as a planned [[manufacturing]] center for [[textile]]s, Lowell is located along the rapids of the [[Merrimack River]], {{cvt|25|mile}} northwest of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] in what was once the farming community of East [[Chelmsford, Massachusetts]]. The so-called [[Boston Associates]], including [[Nathan Appleton]] and [[Patrick Tracy Jackson]] of the [[Boston Manufacturing Company]], named the new mill town after their visionary leader, [[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Francis Cabot Lowell]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=3011|title=Profile for Lowell, Massachusetts, MA|publisher=ePodunk|access-date=August 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190515115200/http://epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=3011|archive-date=May 15, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> who had died five years before its 1823 incorporation. As Lowell's population grew, it acquired land from neighboring towns, and diversified into a full-fledged urban center. Many of the men who composed the labor force for constructing the canals and factories had immigrated from [[Ireland]], escaping the poverty and [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of the 1830s and 1840s. The mill workers, young single women called [[Mill Girls]], generally came from the farm families of New England.

By the 1850s, Lowell had the largest industrial complex in the United States. The textile industry wove cotton produced in the [[Southern United States]]. In 1860, there were more cotton spindles in Lowell than in all eleven states combined that would form the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref>Stephen J. Goldfarb, "A Note on Limits to Growth of the Cotton-Textile Industry in the Old South", ''Journal of Southern History'', 48, (1982), 545.</ref> Many of the coarse cottons produced in Lowell eventually returned to the South to clothe enslaved people, and, according to historian Sven Beckert, "'Lowell' became the generic term slaves used to describe coarse cottons."<ref>{{Cite book|title = Empire of Cotton: a Global History|last = Beckert|first = Sven|publisher = Knopf|year = 2014|location = New York}}</ref> The city continued to thrive as a major industrial center during the 19th century, attracting more migrant workers and immigrants to its mills. Next were the [[Catholic Germans]], followed by a large influx of [[French Canadians]] during the 1870s and 1880s. Later waves of immigrants came to work in Lowell and settled in ethnic neighborhoods, with the city's population reaching almost 50% foreign-born by 1900.<ref name="Yankee">[http://www.yankeemagazine.com/issues/2009-11/features/lowell-timeline/1 Marion, Paul, "Timeline of Lowell History From 1600s to 2009"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316054422/http://www.yankeemagazine.com/issues/2009-11/features/lowell-timeline/1 |date=March 16, 2012 }}, ''[[Yankee Magazine|Yankee]]'' magazine, November 2009.</ref>  By the time [[World War I]] broke out in Europe, the city had reached its economic peak.

In 1922, it was affected by the [[1922 New England Textile Strike]], shutting down the mills in the city over an attempted wage cut.<ref name=":122">{{Cite book |last1=Foner |first1=Philip Sheldon |title=History of the labor movement in the United States. 9: The T.U.E.L. to the end of the Gompers era / by Philip S.

The Mill Cities' manufacturing base declined as companies began to relocate to the South in the 1920s.<ref name="Yankee" /> The city fell into hard times, and was even referred to as a "depressed industrial desert" by ''Harper's Magazine'' in 1931, as the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] worsened. At this time, more than one third of its population was "on relief" (government assistance), as only three of its major textile corporations remained active.<ref name="Yankee" /> Several years later, the mills were reactivated, making [[parachute]]s and other military necessities for [[World War II]]. However, this economic boost was short-lived and the post-war years saw the last textile plants close.
[[File:Abandoned mill in Lowell.jpg|thumbnail|left|Mills sat abandoned after industry left the city in the early twentieth century.]]

=== Zoning, development and the Massachusetts Miracle ===
In the 1970s, Lowell became part of the [[Massachusetts Miracle]], being the headquarters of [[Wang Laboratories]]. At the same time, Lowell became home to thousands of new immigrants, many from [[Cambodia]], following the [[genocide]] at the hands of the [[Khmer Rouge]]. The city continued to rebound, but this time, focusing more on culture. The former mill district along the river was partially restored and became part of the [[Lowell National Historical Park]], founded in the late 1970s.[[File:Lowell Park HQ.jpg|thumbnail|left|Former mill agent's house]]

Although Wang went bankrupt in 1992, the city continued its cultural focus by hosting the nation's largest free folk festival, the [[Lowell Folk Festival]], as well as many other cultural events. This effort began to attract other companies and families back to the urban center. Additional historic manufacturing and commercial buildings were [[adaptive reuse|adapted]] as residential units and office space. By the 1990s, Lowell had built a new ballpark and arena, which became home to two minor league sports teams, the [[Lowell Devils]] and [[Lowell Spinners]]. The city also began to have a larger student population. The [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]] and [[Middlesex Community College (Massachusetts)|Middlesex Community College]] expanded their programs and enrollment. During the period of time when Lowell was part of the Massachusetts Miracle, the Lowell City Development Authority created a Comprehensive Master Plan which included recommendations for zoning adaptations within the city. The city's original zoning code was adopted in 1926 and was significantly revised in 1966 and 2004, with changes included to respond to concerns about overdevelopment.<ref>City of Lowell Master Plan Update: Existing Conditions Report, Department of Planning and Development, December 2011, 3.0 Land-Use pg 31</ref>

In 2002, in lieu of updating the Comprehensive Master Plan, more broad changes were recommended so that the land use and development would be consistent with the current master plan. The most significant revision to the 1966 zoning code is the adoption of an inclusion of a [[transect-based zoning code]] and some aspects of a [[form-based code]] style of zoning that emphasizes urban design elements as a means to ensure that infill development will respect the character of the neighborhood or district in question. By 2004, the recommended zoning changes were unanimously adopted by the City Council and despite numerous changes to the 2004 Zoning Code, it remains the basic framework for resolving zoning issues in Lowell to this day.<ref>City of Lowell Master Plan Update: Existing Conditions Report, Department of Planning and Development, December 2011, 3.0 Land-Use pg 32</ref>
[[File:Pawtucket Canal at Central St looking west, Lowell MA.jpg|thumbnail|right|Pawtucket Canal]]

The [[Hamilton Canal District]] (HCD) is the first district in Lowell in which regulation and development is defined by Form-Based Code (HCD-FBC) and legislated by its own guiding framework consistent to the HCD Master Plan.<ref>Hamilton Canal District Form-Based Code Zoning Section, City of Lowell Zoning Section 10.3, February 2009 pg 4</ref> The HCD is a major redevelopment project that comprises 13 acres of vacant, underutilized land in downtown Lowell abutting former industrial mills. [[Trinity Financial]] was elected as the Master Developer to recreate this district with a vision of making a mixed-use neighborhood. Development plans included establishing the HCD as a gateway to downtown Lowell and enhanced connectivity to [[Lowell (MBTA station)|Gallagher Terminal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trinityfinancial.com/sub/hamiltoncanal.php |title=Hamilton Canal District, Lowell, Massachusetts |website=trinityfinancial.com |publisher=Trinity Financial LLC |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006125014/http://www.trinityfinancial.com/sub/hamiltoncanal.php |archive-date=October 6, 2014 }}</ref><ref>Hamilton Canal District Master Plan, September 2008 pg. 6</ref>

===Anti-crime efforts===
In the 1990s, Lowell had been locally notorious for being a place of high drug trafficking and gang activity, and was the setting for a real life documentary, ''[[High on Crack Street: Lost Lives in Lowell]].''  In the years from 1994 to 1999, crime dropped 50 percent, the highest rate of decrease for any city in America with over 100,000 residents.

Within one generation, by 2009, Lowell was ranked as the 139th most dangerous city of over 75,000 residents in the United States, out of 393 communities.  Out of Massachusetts cities, nine are larger than 75,000 residents, and Lowell was fifth.<ref name="City Crime Rankings, 2009-2010">{{cite web|url=http://os.cqpress.com/citycrime/2009/CityCrimeRankings2009.htm|title=CQ Press: City Crime Rankings 2009|access-date=April 27, 2010|archive-date=September 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901124312/http://os.cqpress.com/citycrime/2009/CityCrimeRankings2009.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> For comparison Lowell was still rated safer than Boston (104 of 393), Providence, RI (123), Springfield (51), Lynn (120), Fall River (103), and New Bedford (85), but rated more dangerous than Cambridge (303), Newton (388), Quincy (312), and Worcester (175).<ref name="City Crime Rankings, 2009-2010" />

===Physical===

[[File:1975 map of canal system in Lowell, Massachusetts.png|thumb|right|Central Lowell's canal system (1975). The city limits extend in all directions from this central core.]]
Lowell is located at the [[confluence]] of the [[Merrimack River|Merrimack]] and [[Concord River|Concord]] rivers. The [[Pawtucket Falls (Massachusetts)|Pawtucket Falls]], a mile-long set of rapids with a total drop in elevation of 32 feet, ends where the two rivers meet. At the top of the falls is the Pawtucket Dam, designed to turn the upper Merrimack into a [[millpond]], diverted through Lowell's extensive canal system.

The Merrimack, which flows southerly from [[Franklin, New Hampshire]] to Lowell, makes a northeasterly turn there before emptying into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]], approximately {{cvt|40|mile}} downriver from Lowell. It is believed that in prior ages, the Merrimack continued south from Lowell to empty into the ocean somewhere near [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. The glacial deposits that redirected the flow of the river left the [[drumlin]]s that dot the city, most notably, Fort Hill in the Belvidere neighborhood. Other large hills in Lowell include Lynde Hill, also in Belvidere, and Christian Hill, in the easternmost part of Centralville at the [[Dracut, Massachusetts|Dracut]] town line.

The Concord, or Musketaquid (its original name), forms from the confluence of the [[Assabet River|Assabet]] and [[Sudbury River|Sudbury]] rivers at [[Concord, Massachusetts]]. This river flows north into the city, and the area around the confluence with the Merrimack was known as Wamesit. Like the Merrimack, the Concord, although a much smaller river, has many waterfalls and rapids that served as power sources for early industrial purposes, some well before the founding of Lowell. Immediately after the Concord joins the Merrimack, the Merrimack descends another ten feet in Hunt's Falls.

There is a ninety-degree bend in the Merrimack partway down the Pawtucket Falls. At this point, the river briefly widens and shallows. Here, [[Beaver Brook (Merrimack River)|Beaver Brook]] enters from the north, separating the city's two northern neighborhoods, [[Pawtucketville]] and Centralville. Entering the Concord River from the southwest is River Meadow, or Hale's Brook. This brook flows largely in a man-made channel, as the [[Lowell Connector]] was built along it. Both of these minor streams have limited industrial histories as well.

The bordering towns (clockwise from north) are [[Dracut, Massachusetts|Dracut]], [[Tewksbury, Massachusetts|Tewksbury]], [[Billerica, Massachusetts|Billerica]], [[Chelmsford, Massachusetts|Chelmsford]], and [[Tyngsborough, Massachusetts|Tyngsborough]]. The border with Billerica is a point in the middle{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} of the Concord River where Lowell and Billerica meet Tewksbury and Chelmsford.

The ten communities designated part of the Lowell Metropolitan area by the 2000 US Census are [[Billerica, Massachusetts|Billerica]], [[Chelmsford, Massachusetts|Chelmsford]], [[Dracut, Massachusetts|Dracut]], [[Dunstable, Massachusetts|Dunstable]], [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]], Lowell, [[Pepperell, Massachusetts|Pepperell]], [[Tewksbury, Massachusetts|Tewksbury]], [[Tyngsborough, Massachusetts|Tyngsborough]], and [[Westford, Massachusetts|Westford]], and [[Pelham, New Hampshire]]. See [[Greater Lowell]].

===Neighborhoods===
[[File:North Common Village, with Saint Jean-Baptiste Church in background; Lowell, MA; 2011-09-03.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Acre neighborhood]]
Lowell has eight distinct neighborhoods: the Acre, Back Central, Belvidere, Centralville, Downtown, Highlands, Pawtucketville, and South Lowell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lowellma.gov/depts/dpd/services/planning/neighborhoods|title=City of Lowell|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513014638/http://www.lowellma.gov/depts/dpd/services/planning/neighborhoods|archive-date=May 13, 2012}}</ref> The city also has five [[ZIP code]]s: four are geographically distinct general ZIP codes, and one (01853) is for post-office boxes only.

The '''Centralville''' neighborhood, ZIP Code 01850, is the northeastern section of the city, north of the Merrimack River and east of [[Beaver Brook (Merrimack River)|Beaver Brook]]. Christian Hill is the section of Centralville east of Bridge Street.

The '''Highlands''', ZIP Code 01851, is the most populated neighborhood, with almost a quarter of the city residing here. It is located in the southwestern section of the city, bordered to the east by the Lowell Connector and to the north by the railroad. Lowellians further distinguish the sections of the Highlands as the Upper Highlands and the Lower Highlands, the latter being the area closer to downtown. Middlesex Village, Tyler Park, and Drum Hill are in this ZIP Code. The Upper Highlands also includes the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell|University of Massachusetts Lowell, South Campus]] (Fine Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, Health Sciences & Education).

'''Downtown''', '''Belvidere''', '''Back Central''', and '''South Lowell''' make up the 01852 ZIP Code, and are the southeastern sections of the city (south of the [[Merrimack River]] and southeast of the Lowell Connector). Belvidere is the mostly residential area south of the Merrimack River, east of the Concord River, and north of the Lowell and Lawrence railroad. [[Belvidere Hill Historic District]] runs along Fairmount Street. Lower Belvidere is the section west of Nesmith Street. [[Rogers Fort Hill Park Historic District]], [[Lowell Cemetery (Lowell, Massachusetts)|Lowell Cemetery]], and [[Shedd Park (Lowell, Massachusetts)|Shedd Park]] are this side of town. Back Central is an urban area south of downtown, toward the mouth of River Meadow Brook. South Lowell is the area south of the railroad and east of the Concord River. Other minor neighborhoods within this ZIP Code are Ayers City, Bleachery, Chapel Hill, the Grove, Oaklands, Riverside Park, Swede Village, and Wigginville.  Although the use of the names of these smaller neighborhoods has been in decline in the past decades, there has been recently a reemergence of their use.  Downtown Lowell includes the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell|UMass Lowell]] East Campus which consists of university housing, recreation facilities, research and the [[Tsongas Center|university's sports arena]], as well as the [[Middlesex Community College (Massachusetts)|Middlesex Community College]].

'''Pawtucketville''', the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]], North Campus; and '''the Acre''' make up the 01854 ZIP Code.  The northwestern portion of the city includes the neighborhood where [[Jack Kerouac]] resided around the area of University Avenue (previously known as Moody Street). The North Campus of [[University of Massachusetts Lowell|UMass Lowell]] (Colleges of Engineering, Sciences and Business) is in Pawtucketville near the Lowell General Hospital. The older parts of the neighborhood are around University Avenue and [[Mammoth Road]], whereas the newer parts are around Varnum Avenue. Pawtucketville is the official entrance to the [[Lowell-Dracut-Tyngsboro State Forest|Lowell-Dracut-Tyngsborough State Forest]], the site of an historic Native American tribe, and in the age of the Industrial Revolution was a prominent source of granite used in canals and factory foundations.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/northeast/ldtf.htm |title=Lowell-Dracut-Tyngsboro State Forest |access-date=March 3, 2010 |archive-date=February 5, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205041651/http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/northeast/ldtf.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{Main|Pollard Memorial Library}}

The first Lowell public library was established in 1844 with 3,500 volumes, and was set up in the first floor of the Old City Hall, 226 Merrimack St. In 1872, the expanding collection was relocated down the street to the [[Hosford Building]]<ref>C.B.

=== Voting rights lawsuit ===

Lowell is the last city in Massachusetts to use a fully plurality-at-large system due to its impact in diluting minority representation on its city council and school committee. With majority bloc voting these two committees were all-white, and had been mostly so for decades, despite the fact that the city's minority population had grown to 49%.<ref name="VRALawsuit">{{cite web |title=Minority Residents Allege City's At-Large Electoral System Unlawfully Dilutes Their Vote |url=http://lawyersforcivilrights.org/our-impact/voting-rights/voting-rights-lawsuit-filed-against-lowell-mass/ |website=Lawyers for Civil Rights |access-date=2019-07-27 |archive-date=July 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727200101/http://lawyersforcivilrights.org/our-impact/voting-rights/voting-rights-lawsuit-filed-against-lowell-mass/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

* A single-member district-based system, with nine city council districts including at least two majority-minority districts, and three school committee districts electing two members each, with at least one being a majority-minority district.
* A hybrid system that combines single-member district-based seats with at-large seats:
** Hybrid 8-1 will have eight single-member districts (at least two majority-minority) and one at-large seat for the city council, and four single-member districts (at least one majority-minority) and two at-large seats for the school committee;
** Hybrid 8-3 is the same as 8-1 but expanding the city council by two at-large seats;
** Hybrid 7-2 will have seven single-member districts (at least two majority-minority) and two at-large seats for the city council, and seven single-member districts (at least two majority-minority) for the school committee (increasing its size by one);
* An at-large system of nine city council seats and six school committee seats, elected using single transferable vote — a return to the system in place between 1943 and 1957.
* A three-district system elected using single transferable vote, with three members from each elected to the city council and two members from each elected to the school committee.

Two options will be selected by the city council and will be put before the voters to choose in a non-binding referendum in November 2019, with a final decision by the city council in December 2019. The new system must be put in place by the November 2021 municipal elections.
