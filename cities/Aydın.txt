'''Aydın''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|d|ɪ|n}} ''EYE-din''; {{IPA|tr|ˈajdɯn|lang}}; formerly named ''Güzelhisar; [[Greek language|Greek]]: Τράλλεις)'' is a city in and the seat of [[Aydın Province]] in Turkey's [[Aegean Region, Turkey|Aegean Region]]. The city is located at the heart of the lower valley of [[Büyük Menderes River]] (ancient [[Maeander River|Meander River]]) at a commanding position for the region extending from the uplands of the valley down to the seacoast. The city forms the urban part of the [[Efeler]] district, with a population of 259,027 in 2022.<ref name=citypop/> Aydın city is located along a region which was famous for its fertility and productivity since ancient times. [[ficus|Fig]]s remain the province's best-known crop, although other agricultural products are also grown intensively and the city has some [[light industry]].

At the crossroads of a busy transport network of several types, a six-lane motorway connects Aydın to [[İzmir]], Turkey's second port, in less than an hour, and in still less time to the international [[Adnan Menderes Airport]], located along the road between the two cities. A smaller airport, namely [[Aydın Airport]], is located a few kilometers in the South-East of Aydın. The region of Aydın also pioneered the introduction of railways into Turkey in the 19th century and still has the densest railroad network.

The province of Aydın is also where a number of internationally known historic sites and centers of tourism are concentrated.

==Etymology==
[[File:TrallesBögen.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ancient city of [[Tralles]] in Aydın]] 
[[File:AydınArchaeologicalMuseum_(96).JPG|thumb| Women statues in [[Aydın Archaeological Museum]].]]
[[File:AydınArchaeologicalMuseum_(97).JPG|thumb|200px|Ancient Roman statue of a child with dolphin found in Nysa in [[Aydın Archaeological Museum]] in Aydın.]]

After the first capture of the city by the Turks under the emirate ([[Anatolian beyliks|Beylik]]) of [[Menteşe (beylik)|Menteşe]] ([[Menteshe]]), whose lands extended towards the south, who named it for a first period as ''Güzelhisar'', literally ''"the beautiful castle"'' (sometimes rendered as ''Guzel Hissar''). The city was later taken over by Turks of the [[Aydinids]], whose lands extended towards the north, who named it after Aydinid dynasty. ''"Aydın"'' meant ''"lucid, enlightened"'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and in a distinct evolution of the term, came to mean ''"lettered, educated, intellectual"'' in modern Turkish. It is still a popular male name.

In ancient Greek sources, the name of the city is given as '''Anthea''' (Ανθέα) and '''Euanthia''' (Ευανθία). During the [[Seleucid]] period, it received the name '''Antiochia''' (Greek: Αντιόχεια). At other times it was also called '''Seleucia ad Maeandrum''' (Σελεύκεια επί του Μαιάνδρου) and '''Erynina''' (Ερυνίνα).<ref>{{cite book|last=Hazlitt|first=William|title=The Classical Gazetteer|url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/gazetteer/0355.html|year=1851|page=353}}</ref> In [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times, it was known as '''Tralles''' (in [[Latin]]) or '''Tralleis''' (Τράλλεις in [[Ancient Greek]]), and was one of the largest Aegean cities in antiquity. There is some indication that it once bore the name '''Charax''' (Χάραξ), but that name may have belonged to [[Acharaca]].<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Edward Smedley |editor2=Hugh James Rose |editor3=Henry John Rose|title=Encyclopædia Metropolitana|volume=XXI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E_FWyKOb_BwC&pg=PA624|place=London|year=1845 |page=624|access-date=August 22, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Mary Ann Dwight|title=Grecian and Roman Mythology|url=https://archive.org/details/grecianandroman01dwiggoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/grecianandroman01dwiggoog/page/n509 443]|edition=2nd|publisher=George P. Putnam|place=New York|year=1849|access-date=August 22, 2018}}</ref>

Nevertheless, the name Güzelhisar was used throughout the early centuries of the Ottoman administration as well, often recorded in adjectival form, as ''"Güzelhisar of Aydın (lands)"'', but the name Aydın was increasingly preferred. This previous Turkish name also found its way into the international trade vocabulary until at least the end of the 18th century and its modified forms ''Joselassar'' and even ''Joseph Lasat'' were used to describe a fine type of cotton produced in this same region and much sought after.<ref>{{cite book |title= [[Encyclopédie Méthodique]] |volume=15 |publisher = [[Charles-Joseph Panckoucke]] |year= 1783 |page=732}}</ref>

==History==
===Antiquity===
According to [[Strabo]] Tralles was founded by the [[Argives]] and [[Trallians]]. Along with the rest of [[Lydia]], the city fell to the [[Persian Empire]]. After its success against [[Athens]] in the [[Peloponnesian War]], [[Sparta]] unsuccessfully sought to take the city from the Persians, but in 334 BC, Tralles surrendered to [[Alexander the Great]] without resistance and therefore was not sacked. Alexander's general [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]] held the city from 313 to 301 BC and later the [[Seleucid]]s held the city until 190 BC when it fell to [[Pergamon]]. From 133 to 129 BC, the city supported [[Aristonicus of Pergamon]], a pretender to the Pergamene throne, against the Romans.  After the Romans defeated him, they revoked the city's right to mint coins.

Tralles was a [[conventus]] for a time under the Roman Republic, but [[Ephesus]] later took over that position. The city was taken by rebels during the [[Mithridatic War]] during which many Roman inhabitants were killed. Tralles suffered greatly from an [[earthquake]] in 26 BC. [[Augustus]] provided funds for its reconstruction after which the city thanked him by renaming itself '''Caesarea'''.

Strabo describes the city as a prosperous trading center, listing famous residents of the city, including [[Pythodoros of Tralles|Pythodoros]] (native of [[Nysa (Caria)|Nysa]]), and orators Damasus Scombrus and Dionysocles. Several centuries later, [[Anthemius of Tralles]], architect of the [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]], was born in Tralles.

===Christianity and Byzantine era===
{{see|Tralles (diocese)}}
[[File:Alexander_Trallianus_(1906)_-_Veloso_Salgado.png|left|thumb|[[Alexander of Tralles]] was one of the most eminent physicians of the early Byzantine Empire.]]
An early [[bishop]] [[Polybius of Tralles|Polybius]] (fl. ca. 105) is attested by a letter from [[Saint Ignatius of Antioch]] to the church at Tralles. The city was officially [[Christianized]], along with the rest of [[Caria]], early after the conversion of [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]], at which time the [[Episcopal see|see]] was confirmed. Among the recorded bishops are: Heracleon (431), Maximus (451), Uranius (553), Myron (692), Theophylactus (787), Theophanes and Theopistus both ninth century, and John (1230). The [[Catholic Church]] includes this bishopric in its list of  [[titular see]]s as Tralles in Asia, distinguishing it from the see of [[Lydia#Episcopal sees|Tralles in Lydia]]. It has appointed no new [[titular bishop]] to these Eastern sees since the [[Second Vatican Council]].<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 995</ref>

After the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, with the [[Byzantine Empire]] was in civil chaos, the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]]s took Tralles for the first time but [[Alexios I Komnenos]] re-captured the city for Byzantium in the later half of the eleventh century.

By the 13th century, the city lay in ruins. In 1278, [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]] decided to rebuild and repopulate it, now to be renamed Andronikopolis or Palaiologopolis, with the aim of forming a bulwark against Turkish encroachment in the area. The ''megas domestikos'' [[Michael Tarchaneiotes]] was given the task: he rebuilt the walls and settled 36,000 people from the surrounding regions. 13th century Byzantine settlement policy along the Meander Valley notably involved the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Cumans]].<ref>{{citation|title= The Late Byzantine Army: Arms and Society, 1204-1453|author = Mark L. Bartusis|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year= 1997|isbn= 978-0-8122-1620-2|page= 26}}</ref>  Nevertheless, Turkish attacks resumed soon after. The city was besieged and, lacking sufficient supplies and access to water, captured by the beylik of [[Menteshe]] in 1284. The city suffered extensive destruction and part of its inhabitants were massacred.<ref>[[Speros Vryonis]], [https://www.scribd.com/doc/39065646/Vryonis-Decline-of-Medieval-Hellinism-in-Asia-Minor ''The Decline of Medieval Hellenism in Asia Minor and the Process of Islamization from the Eleventh through the Fifteenth Century''] (University of California Press, 1971), p. 251</ref> Moreover, over 20,000 inhabitants were sold off as slaves.<ref>{{citation|title=The Last Centuries of Byzantium, 1261–1453 | first=Donald MacGillivray|last=Nicol|author-link=Donald Nicol|publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=1993|isbn=978-0-521-43991-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2d6OHLqwEsC|page=86}}</ref><ref>{{citation|editor-first = Alexander|editor-last=Kazhdan|editor-link=Alexander Kazhdan|title = [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]]|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1991|isbn = 978-0-19-504652-6|page=1284}}</ref>

===Turkic and Ottoman era===
Under the rule of [[Menteshe]], whose lands extended towards the south, the city was renamed as '''Güzelhisar''' ("beautiful castle"). The city was later taken over by the [[Aydinids]], who made it one of their principal settlements, but not the capital.

The Beylik of [[Aydinids|Aydin]] was founded in the region in 1307 and they ruled the lands north of [[Büyük Menderes River]] up to and including [[İzmir]]. During the first half of the 14th century, Aydinids were as active as the Ottomans, if not more, in pressuring the islands and the lands west of [[Anatolia]], and they caused much hardship for the Byzantine and Latin dependencies of the [[Aegean Sea]] and mainland Greece.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest|author= John Van Antwerp Fine Jr|publisher = [[University of Michigan Press]] |year= 1991 |page=292}}</ref> The principality was taken over by the rising [[Ottoman Empire]], for the first time shortly before the [[Battle of Ankara]] between the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]] and [[Tamerlane]] in 1402, and then Tamerlane having given back the province to the sons of Aydın. Finally Ottomans definitely captured it in 1425.

Aydın became part of [[Anatolia Province, Ottoman Empire|Anatolia Province]] of the Ottoman Empire and this until 1827, when it became the seat of its own [[Eyalet of Aydin|eyalet]] under its own name, constituted among other reasons to respond to the prevalent unrest in the region, as exemplified by [[Atçalı Kel Mehmet]] Rebellion (1829–1830). The seat was moved to İzmir in the 1840s and with the abolition of eyalets under the administrative reforms of 1864, Aydın became a [[sanjak]] (''subprovince'') of the [[vilayet]] [[Aidin Vilayet|of the same name]], with its seat still in İzmir, which had outgrown Aydın city in size as it became a booming port of international trade.

In the 19th century Aydın continued to benefit from its location at the center of the fertile Menderes valley, and its population grew.<ref>According to 1912 figures, the Sandjak of Aydın had a total population of 220000, in which 39000-54500 according to varying sources, were [[Greeks]]. The sizable share of the Greek population was, as it was the case with many other localities across Western [[Anatolia]], the result of an increase due to [[economic migration]] from [[Aegean Islands]] or even the Greek mainland to fertile Anatolian valleys as of the beginning of the 19th century and especially during its second half. An 1856 [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] report presented to the [[Secretary of State for War]] describes Aydın region in elogious terms and Aydın and the [[Menderes River]] valley to be entirely [[Turkish people|Turk]].[https://books.google.com/books?id=IicAAAAAQAAJ&q=report+on+smyrna (full text) Report on Smyrna by George Rolleston] for the [[Secretary of State for War]]. Section on Aydın, p. 104-108</ref> At that time, besides [[ficus|fig]]s and [[olive oil]], which were the traditional crops of the region, [[cotton]] also grew in importance, with many European investors seeking alternative sources of cotton at the time of the [[American Civil War]].

===Construction of İzmir-Aydın railway===
The first railroad commenced in the Ottoman Empire and the first finished within the present-day territory of Turkey<ref>A short line built in [[Dobruja]] was started later but finished earlier than İzmir-Aydın railway.</ref> was built by the British [[Levant Company]] connecting Aydın to Smyrna (now [[İzmir]]). The {{convert|130|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} line was started in 1856 and finished in ten years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fast lines take priority in Turkish investment |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view//fast-lines-take-priority-in-turkish-investment.html |publisher=[[Railway Gazette International]] |author=Mustafa Cavusoglu |date=May 2006 |access-date=2006-05-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918213423/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/fast-lines-take-priority-in-turkish-investment.html |archive-date=September 18, 2012 }}</ref> The line fundamentally changed Aydın region's economy. The railway station built at the time remains an impressive structure in the city of Aydın.

===Greek occupation===
During the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]], violent fighting took place in and around Aydın [Αϊδίνιο], especially in the beginning phase of the war, during the [[Battle of Aydın]] between 27 June and 4 July 1919. The civilian population of the city, principally Turkish as well as Greek,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sam.gov.tr/perceptions/sampapers/GREEKOCCUPATIONOFIZMIR.pdf |title=Greek Occupation of İzmir and Adjoining Territories - Report of the Inter-allied Commission of Inquiry (May–September 1919) |last=Erhan |first=Çağrı |date=April 1999 |work=SAM Papers No. 2/99 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629155426/http://www.sam.gov.tr/perceptions/sampapers/GREEKOCCUPATIONOFIZMIR.pdf |archive-date=2007-06-29 }}</ref> suffered heavy casualties.

===The "efe" resistance===
[[File:Dilek_Yarımadası-Büyük_Menderes_Deltası_Millî_Parkı_2013-03-28b.jpg|thumb|[[Dilek Peninsula-Büyük Menderes Delta National Park]] in Aydın.]]
Aydın remained in ruins until it was re-captured by the Turkish army on 7 September 1922. Resistance warriors such as the [[efe (zeibek)|efe]] [[Yörük Ali]], who were based in the surrounding mountains and conducted a guerrilla warfare against the Greek army, became heroes in Turkey. Following the war and the foundation of the Republic of Turkey, the Greeks of Aydın were exchanged with Muslims living in Greece under the 1923 agreement for the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]].

===Modern Aydın===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2024}}
[[File:AydınBusTerminus_(4).JPG|thumb|Intercity bus terminus of Aydın]]
Recent decades have seen Aydın going beyond its traditional role as a hub for agricultural products, and developing a diversified economy increasingly based on services. One event in this process was the opening in 1992 of [[Adnan Menderes University]], named after a favorite son of Efeler, Aydın [[Adnan Menderes]], [[List of Prime Ministers of Turkey|Turkey's prime minister]] during the 1950s. The pace of the economy is determined by the city's location, at only an hour's drive from the seashore. Many residents of Aydın typically have summer houses and investments in or around such centers of tourism as [[Kuşadası]], [[Güzelçamlı]] and [[Didim]].

But still the city has a quiet country market town feel to it and its dominance, within both the [[Turkey|Turkish market]] and abroad, in the production of a number of agricultural products, particularly figs, still identifies [[Aydın Province]], and most of this trade is managed and handled from Aydın itself.

[[File:Central_Library,_Adnan_Menderes_University.jpg|thumb|left|Central Library in Aydın University.]]
Aydın city centre is still relatively small but growing, centred on one palm-lined avenue of shops and cafes, and a maze of narrow side streets, dotted with orange trees. The people more family-oriented, so there is little night life, or cultural amenities for young people, although presumably now they have a university this will change. There are a number of mosques, high schools, ''dersane'' (private courses cramming students for the university entrance exams) and other public buildings. Like all Turkish cities Aydın is now spreading as the middle-classes are leaving their flats in the city for smarter apartments or houses slightly out of town.

== Climate ==
Aydın has a hot summer [[Mediterranean climate]] (Csa) under both the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] and [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]] classification systems. Summers are very hot and dry, with highs above {{Convert|35.0|C|F|abbr=on}} on most summer days. Spring and fall are warm and variable, while winters are mild and quite rainy.

Highest recorded temperature: {{Convert|45.1|C|F|abbr=on}} on 3 August 2021<br>lowest recorded temperature: {{Convert|-11.0|C|F|abbr=on}} on 4 January 1942<ref name=eather1/>

Some citizens usually produce olive oil but there are also many small-scale firms which export olive oil to different countries.<ref name=Prothero90>{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Anatolia|year=1920|publisher=H.M.
