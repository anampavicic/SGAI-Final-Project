[[File:Port of Aden, Yemen from ISS.jpg|thumb|215x215px|Port of Aden from the [[ISS]], 2016]]
'''Aden''' ({{Langx|ar|ÿπŸéÿØŸéŸÜŸí| øAdan}},  [[Old South Arabian]]: ê©≤ê©µê©¨) is a port city located in [[Yemen]] in the southern part of the Arabian peninsula, positioned near the eastern approach to the [[Red Sea]]. It is situated approximately 170 km (110 mi) east of the [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] strait and north of the  [[Gulf of Aden]]. With its strategic location on the coastline, Aden serves as a gateway between the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea, making it a crucial maritime hub connecting [[Africa]], [[Asia]], and the [[Middle East]]. As of 2023, Aden City has a population of approximately 1,080,000 residents, making it one of the largest cities in Yemen.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Aden Population 2023 |url=https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/aden-population |access-date=2023-08-14 |website=worldpopulationreview.com |archive-date=16 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230516192538/https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/aden-population |url-status=live }}</ref>
Aden is divided into eight districts: [[Tawahi (Aden)|Tawahi]], [[Mualla]], [[Crater (Aden)|Crater]], [[Khur Maksar District|Khur Maksar]], [[Al-Mansoura (Aden)|Al Mansura]], [[Dar Sad District|Dar Sad]], [[Sheikh Othman]], and [[Al Buraiqeh District|Al Buraiqa]]. These form today's Aden Governorate. During British Colonialism, Aden referred to the area along the north coast of the Gulf of Aden, encompassing Tawahi, Mualla, Crater, and much of Khur Maksar District. The western harbor peninsula, known as Little Aden, now falls within the Al Buraiqa District.
[[File:ADEN_&_LITTLE_ADEN-01.png|thumb|215x215px|Map showing Aden and Little Aden within the modern-day Governorate of Aden]]
Before gaining independence, Aden comprised distinct sub-centers: Crater, the original port; Ma'alla, the modern port; Tawahi, formerly "Steamer Point"; and Gold Mohur resorts. Khormaksar, on the [[isthmus]] connecting Aden to the mainland, hosts diplomatic missions, [[University of Aden|Aden University's]] main offices, and Aden International Airport. On the mainland, sub-centers include Sheikh Othman, an old oasis area; Al-Mansura, a British-planned town; and Madinat ash-Sha'b (formerly Madinat al-Ittihad), the former capital of the [[Federation of South Arabia|South Arabian Federation]], now housing a large power/[[desalination]] facility and additional Aden University faculties. 

Aden encloses the eastern side of a vast, natural harbour that constitutes the modern port. A long time ago this necessitated the existence of Aden's reservoirs, the [[Cisterns of Tawila]]. As described by 14th century scholar [[Ibn Battuta]], "These reservoirs accumulate rainwater for the sole purpose of drinking for the city's citizens." Little Aden became the site of the [[oil refinery]] and tanker port. Both were established and operated by [[BP|British Petroleum]] until they were turned over to [[South Yemen|South Yemeni]] government ownership and control in 1978.

Aden used to be the capital of South Yemen until its [[Yemeni unification|unity]] with [[Yemen Arab Republic|North Yemen]] in 22 May 1990. It is currently the temporary capital of Yemen since the [[Yemeni civil war (2014‚Äìpresent)|2014 ''Coup d'√©tat'']], hosting some members of the [[Cabinet of Yemen]] mainly in [[al-Maashiq Palace]]. It is also the seat of the secessionist [[Southern Transitional Council]], which exercises control over the city.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2019-08-10 |title=Yemen conflict: Southern separatists seize control of Aden |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-49308199 |access-date=2024-02-29 |language=en-GB}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Aden is a home and a place for ships, and the word Aden means reside in the place, so the word ‚ÄúAden‚Äù means resident, and it is said ‚ÄúAden Al-Balad,‚Äù meaning the settlement of the country.<ref>[https://www.almaany.com/ar/dict/ar-ar/%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%86/ '' ÿπÿØŸÜ '' ÿßŸÑŸÖÿπÿ¨ŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸàÿ≥Ÿäÿ∑] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150117042727/http://www.almaany.com/home.php?language=arabic|date=17 ŸäŸÜÿßŸäÿ± 2015}}</ref> Among the sayings of geographers about the city:

[[Yaqut al-Hamawi|Yaqut al-Hamwi]] said:<ref>ŸÖÿπÿ¨ŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿ®ŸÑÿØÿßŸÜ ÿ¨ 4 - ÿµ 89</ref> "It is a famous city on the coast of the Indian Sea, towards the Yemen, and it is poor, with no water or pasture. They drink from a spring between it and Aden, about a distance of about today, and despite that, it is bad, except that this place is the port for Indian ships, and merchants gather there for that reason, as it is a town of trade." And it is added to [[Abyan Governorate|Abyan]], which is the opposite of Aden in its entirety.

[[Ibn Manzur]] said:<ref>''ŸÑÿ≥ÿßŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ® '' ÿ¨10 ÿµ 65</ref> ‚ÄúIt is a country on the edge of the sea in the farthest part of Yemen.‚Äù

[[Ibn Khaldun]] said:<ref>ÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ÿßÿ®ŸÜ ÿÆŸÑÿØŸàŸÜ ÿ¨ 4 ÿµ 218</ref> ‚ÄúThis Aden is one of the most fortified cities in Yemen, and it is on the bank of the Indian Sea. It is still a country of trade from the time of the Trabaids, and most of them were built with stones, which is why silk merchants visit it often.‚Äù

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Aden|History of Yemen}}

===Antiquity===
Aden is an ancient port and was mentioned by the Greeks under the name ({{langx|grc|ŒëœÅŒ±Œ≤ŒØŒ± ŒïŒºœÄœåœÅŒπŒøŒΩ|translit=Arabia Emporion}}), which means an Arabic trade port.<ref>''Contributions to the Semitic religious history: the God of Israel and the gods of the Gentiles'' Friedrich Baethgen p.88</ref> The port's convenient position on the sea route between India and Europe has made Aden desirable to rulers who sought to possess it at various times throughout history. Known as [[Eudaemon]] ({{langx|grc|ŒïœÖŒ¥Œ±ŒØŒºœâŒΩ}}, meaning "blissful, prosperous,") in the 1st century BC, it was a transshipping point for the Red Sea trade, but fell on hard times when new shipping practices by-passed it and made the daring direct crossing to India in the 1st century AD, according to the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]''. The same work describes Aden as "a village by the shore," which would well describe the town of Crater while it was still little-developed. There is no mention of fortification at this stage, Aden was more an island than a peninsula as the [[isthmus]] (a [[tombolo]]) was not then so developed as it is today. Aden was explicitly mentioned by this name in the [[Book of Ezekiel]], which talks about Jerusalem, and it says:<ref>{{Citation |last=London |first=Jack |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Sutherland |title=Chapter Twenty-Seven |date=2009-05-28 |work=The Sea-Wolf |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/owc/9780199554942.003.0028 |access-date=2024-02-16 |publisher=Oxford University Press |doi=10.1093/owc/9780199554942.003.0028 |isbn=978-0-19-955494-2}}</ref><blockquote>"The merchants of [[Sheba]] and Raamah are your merchants. They set up your markets with the finest perfumes and every precious stone and gold. Harran, Qena, and Aden are the merchants of Sheba, and Assyria and Kilmud are your merchants."</blockquote>At its beginning, the city was a small peninsula with no significant natural resources, but its location between Egypt and India made it important in the ancient global trade route. The city was the home of the ancient Kingdom of Osan from the eighth to seventh centuries BC.<ref name="Gentiles' p.89">''The Semitic religious history: the God of Israel and the gods of the Gentiles'' Friedrich Baethgen p.89</ref> In the beginning of the seventh century BC, [[Karib'il Watar|Karbil Watar I]], king of the Kingdom of Sheba, launched a campaign against Osan during which, according to the Sabaean texts, sixteen thousand people were killed, forty thousand people were enslaved, and the kings of [[Kingdom of Awsan|Awsan]] made offerings to the god.<ref name="Daniel McLaughlin p.175">Daniel McLaughlin,''Yemen: The Bradt Travel Guide'' p.175</ref> [[Almaqah|al-Maqah]], according to the inscription that Karbiel Watar I left in [[Sirwah]], commemorating his victory.<ref name="Conti Rossini 1931 p.55">Conti Rossini, Carlo, ''Chrestomathia Arabica meridionalis epigraphica edita et glossario instructa'' (1931) Pubblicazioni dell'Instituto per l'Oriente p.55 (4th line)</ref>

In the second half of the first century BC, the Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar determined to control Arabia Felix and reach the Indian Ocean. The Roman governor of Egypt, Aelius Gallus, was sent in 25 BC.

The Himyarite Kingdom fell in the first quarter of the sixth century AD. Yusuf Dhu Nuwas mentioned Bab al-Mandab in one of his writings. The forces of the Kingdom of Aksum were entering Yemen through it. The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Justinian I]] sent a fleet to fight the Himyarite Jews and support the Kingdom of Aksum and the Christians of Najran. The fleet entered through Aden. Byzantine sources indicate that the [[Sasanian Empire]] took control of the city in 671 AD.<ref name="Richard Frye p.325">Richard Frye,The History of Ancient Iran p.325</ref><ref name="ReferenceB">The Oxford Handbook of Late Antiquity edited by Scott Fitzgerald Johnson p.298</ref>

A local legend in Yemen states that Aden may be as old as human history itself. Some also believe that [[Cain and Abel]] are buried somewhere in the city.<ref>Modern Middle East Nations and Their Strategic Place in the World: Yemen, 2004, by Hal Markovitz. {{ISBN|1-59084-521-8}}</ref>

===Medieval history===
Although the pre-Islamic [[Himyar]] civilization was capable of building large structures, there seems to have been little fortification at this stage. Fortifications at Mareb and other places in Yemen and the [[Hadhramaut]] make it clear that both the Himyar and the [[Sabaeans|Sabean]] cultures were well capable of it. Thus, watchtowers, since destroyed, are possible. However, the Arab historians [[Ibn al-Mujawir|Ibn al Mujawir]] and Abu Makhramah attribute the first fortification of Aden to Beni Zuree'a. Abu Makhramah has also included a detailed biography of Muhammad Azim Sultan Qamarbandi Naqsh in his work, Tarikh ul-Yemen. The aim seems to have been twofold: to keep hostile forces out and to maintain revenue by controlling the movement of goods, thereby preventing smuggling. In its original form, some of this work was relatively feeble.

With the introduction of Islam to Yemen in the seventh century AD, Aden experienced a period of stagnation that lasted until the ninth century AD.<ref name="Daniel McLaughlin p.1752">Daniel McLaughlin,''Yemen: The Bradt Travel Guide'' p.175</ref> In the early years of Islam, Aden belonged to the province of Jund (Taiz).<ref name="Early Islam p.182">The Yemen in Early Islam (9-233/630-847): A Political History p.182</ref> It was controlled by the state of [[Ziyadid dynasty|Ziyadid]] and the [[Sulayhid dynasty|Sulayhid]]. After the death of [[Ali al-Sulayhi|Ali bin Muhammad Al-Sulayhi]], his son took charge of [[Zurayids]], and Aden continued to pay the annual royalty until [[Arwa al-Sulayhi|Queen Arwa bint Ahmed Al-Sulayhi]] reduced it.<ref name="H.C. Kay, Yaman 1892, pp. 66-7">H.C. Kay, Yaman: Its early medieval history, London 1892, pp. 66-7</ref> After the fall of the Sulayhid state, the Banu Zurayi became independent in Aden, taking advantage of the Sulayhids‚Äô preoccupation with the [[Khawlan]] tribes.<ref name="ÿπŸÖÿßÿ±ÿ© ÿ®ŸÜ ÿπŸÑŸä ÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ÿßŸÑŸäŸÖŸÜ ÿµ 174">ÿπŸÖÿßÿ±ÿ© ÿ®ŸÜ ÿπŸÑŸä ÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ÿßŸÑŸäŸÖŸÜ ÿµ 174</ref> The Zurayites continued to rule Aden, Lahj, and Abyan for less than forty years until they fell under the Ayyubids‚Äô control of the city.<ref>ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿ±Ÿàÿ±Ÿä ŸÖÿ∏ÿßŸáÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ≠Ÿäÿßÿ© ŸàÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ∂ÿßÿ±ÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑŸäŸÖŸÜ ÿµ 233</ref> A major battle took place between [[Turan-Shah|Turan Shah bin Ayyub]] and Yasser bin Bilal al-Muhammadi, Minister of State, and the Zurayiyyah were defeated and al-Muhammadi fled to Taiz.<ref>ÿßÿ®ŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿØÿ®Ÿäÿπ ''ŸÇÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπŸäŸàŸÜ ŸÅŸä ÿßÿÆÿ®ÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑŸäŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸäŸÖŸàŸÜ'' ÿµ 319</ref> One of the most important reasons that contributed to the defeat of the Zurayids was their ongoing wars with the Bani Mahdi in [[Tihamah|Tihama]] and the departure of their army to confront the Ayyubids instead of fortifying themselves in Aden.<ref>ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿ±Ÿàÿ±Ÿä ŸÖÿ∏ÿßŸáÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ≠Ÿäÿßÿ© ŸàÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ∂ÿßÿ±ÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑŸäŸÖŸÜ ÿµ313</ref>

After [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, Aden was ruled by the [[Sultanate of Lahej]], under suzerainty of the Zaidi imams of Yemen. The first political intercourse between Lahej and the British took place in 1799, when a naval force was sent from Great Britain, with a detachment of troops from India, to occupy the island of Perim and prevent all communication of the French in Egypt with the Indian Ocean, by way of the Red Sea. The island of Perim was found unsuitable for troops, and the Sultan of Lahej, Ahmed bin Abdul Karim, received the detachment for some time at Aden. He proposed to enter into an alliance and to grant Aden as a permanent station, but the offer was declined. A Treaty was, however, concluded with the Sultan in 1802 by Admiral Sir Home Popham, who was instructed to enter into political and commercial alliances with the Chiefs oil the Arabian coast of the Red Sea.<ref name=":02">{{Cite book |last=Aitchison |first=G |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.49919/page/n1/mode/2up |title=A Collection of Treaties, Engagements And Sanads Relating To India And Neighbouring Countries |publisher=Government of India |year=1931 |volume=xi |pages=2‚Äì7}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

The situation was different in the north of the country, where the [[Zaydism|Zaidis]] did not recognize the authority of the Ottomans and revolted against them many times, the most recent of which was the revolution of [[Imams of Yemen|Imam]] ''Al-Mansur Billah Al-Qasim bin Muhammad bin Al-Qasim'', who and his son ''Al-Mu'ayyad Billah Muhammad'' were able to unite the tribes and expel the Ottomans.<ref>Ronald Lewcock,''San'a' an Arabian Islamic City''Melisende UK Ltd p.74</ref> The imams relied on the revenues from the port of [[Mokha|Mocha]], and Aden was not as important as the Abadlahs were. At the end of the eighteenth century, Sultan ''Fadl al-Abdali'' concluded an alliance with the [[Yafa'a|Yafi]] tribes to rebel against the Zaidi imams and monopolize Aden's revenues equally among them.<ref>John M. Willis,''Unmaking North and South: Spatial Histories of Modern Yemen'' p.86</ref> The Sultan of [[Sultanate of Lahej|Lahej]] got rid of the imams, but he did not fulfill his promise to Yafa. The Zaidi imams did not recognize inheritance and saw fighting for the imamate, so the war between ''Al-Nasir Muhammad bin Ishaq'' and ''Al-Mansur Al-Hussein bin Al-Mutawakkil'' prolonged, so Al-Abdali took the opportunity to declare his independence in Lahej and Aden.<ref name="Harold F.

The British tried to conclude treaties with the Zaidi imams after the Ottomans were expelled from Aden. They visited Sana'a and Mokha, but they treated the British ambassador poorly and rejected his offer. Things were different when the Abdali gained independence from Lahj and Medina. They signed a treaty with the British in 1802, stipulating that they build a factory in Crater and allocate a special cemetery for English subjects free of charge. The Abdali wanted English protection from the tribes. Sultan Fadl bin Ali was killed by Yafi‚Äô gunmen, then one of the sheikhs of Al-Hujariya invaded Lahj and besieged it for five months. Al-Awaliq also besieged it with eight thousand fighters, and they did not leave until Sultan Ahmed bin Abdul Karim paid them seven thousand dollars.<ref>Sir Robert Lambert Playfair,''A History of Arabia Feilx or Yemen'' p.161</ref> Then the Fadl family attacked Aden in 1836.

British interests in Aden began in 1796 with [[Napoleon|Napoleon's]] invasion of Egypt, after which a British fleet docked at Aden for several months at the invitation of the sultan. The French were defeated in Egypt in 1801, and their [[privateers]] were tracked down over the subsequent decade.{{cn|date=December 2023}} By 1800, Aden was a small village with a population of 600 Arabs, [[Somalis]], Jews, and Indians‚Äîhoused for the most part in huts of reed matting erected among ruins recalling a vanished era of wealth and prosperity.{{cn|date=December 2023}} As there was little British trade in the Red Sea, most British politicians until the 1830s had no further interest in the area beyond the suppression of piracy. However, a small number of government officials and the [[East India Company]] officials thought that a British base in the area was necessary to prevent another French advance through Egypt or [[The Great Game|Russian expansion through Persia]]. The emergence of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] as a strong local ruler only increased their concerns. The governor of Bombay from 1834 to 1838, [[Sir Robert Grant]], was one of those who believed that India could only be protected by preemptively seizing "places of strength" to protect the Indian Ocean.{{cn|date=December 2023}}

The Red Sea increased in importance after the steamship {{ship|HCS|Hugh Lindsay|1829|2}} sailed from Bombay to the Suez isthmus in 1830, stopping at Aden with the sultan's consent to resupply with coal. Although cargo was still carried around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in sailing ships, a steam route to the Suez could provide a much quicker option for transporting officials and important communications. Grant felt that armed ships steaming regularly between Bombay and Suez would help secure British interests in the region and did all he could to progress his vision. After lengthy negotiations due to the costs of investing in the new technology, the government agreed to pay half the costs for six voyages per year and the East India Company board approved the purchase of two new steamers in 1837. Grant immediately announced that monthly voyages to Suez would take place, despite the fact that no secure coaling station had been found.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Christie |first1=Nikki |title=Gaining and Losing an Empire: Britain 1763‚Äì1914 |date=2016 |publisher=Pearson |pages=53‚Äì55}}</ref>

In 1838, under Muhsin bin Fadl, Lahej ceded {{convert|194|km2|abbr=on}} including Aden to the [[British Empire|British]]. On 19 January 1839, the [[British East India Company]] landed [[Royal Marines]] at Aden to secure the territory and stop attacks by pirates against British shipping to India. In 1850 it was declared a [[free trade]] port, with the liquor, salt, arms, and [[Opium Wars|opium trades]] developing duties as it won all the coffee trade from [[Mokha]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Great Britain Hydrographic Dept|title=The Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Pilot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVDNAAAAMAAJ&pg=PR1|year=1900|edition=5th|publisher=Order of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|page=348}}</ref> The port lies about equidistant from the [[Suez Canal]], [[Bombay]], and [[Zanzibar]], which were all important [[British possessions]].

The [[hinterland]] of Aden and [[Hadhramaut]] were also loosely tied to Britain as the [[Aden Protectorate]], which was overseen from Aden.

Aden's location also made it a useful ''[[entrep√¥t]]'' for [[mail]] passing between places around the [[Indian Ocean]] and Europe.

{{main|Federation of South Arabia|Aden Emergency}}

In order to stabilize Aden and the surrounding Aden Protectorate from the designs of the Egyptian backed republicans of [[Yemen Arab Republic|North Yemen]], the British attempted to gradually unite the disparate states of the region in preparation for eventual independence. On 18 January 1963, the Colony of Aden was incorporated into the [[Federation of Arab Emirates of the South]] against the wishes of North Yemen. The city became the [[State of Aden]] and the Federation was renamed the [[Federation of South Arabia]] (FSA).

An insurgency against British administration known as the [[Aden Emergency]] began with a grenade attack by the communist [[National Liberation Front (Yemen)|National Liberation Front]] (NLF), against the British High Commissioner on 10 December 1963, killing one person and injuring fifty, and a "state of emergency" was declared.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Rob |date=2016-03-28 |title=Out of Arabia: British Strategy and the Fate of Local Forces in Aden, South Yemen, and Oman, 1967‚Äì76 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07075332.2016.1152994 |journal=The International History Review |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=143‚Äì164 |doi=10.1080/07075332.2016.1152994 |issn=0707-5332}}</ref>

In 1964, Britain announced its intention to grant independence to the FSA in 1968, but that the British military would remain in Aden. The security situation deteriorated as NLF and FLOSY ([[Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen]]) vied for the upper hand.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Walker |first=Jonathan |title=Aden Insurgency: The Savage War in Yeman 1962-67 |publisher=Pen & Sword Military |isbn=978-1473827639 |publication-date=Feb 9, 2015 |language=English}}</ref>

In January 1967, there were mass riots between the NLF and their rival FLOSY supporters in the old Arab quarter of Aden town. This conflict continued until mid February, despite the intervention of British troops. On 20 June 1967, 23 British Army soldiers were ambushed and shot dead by members of Aden Police during the Aden Mutiny in the Crater District. During the period there were as many attacks on the British troops by both sides as against each other culminating in the destruction of an [[Aden Airways]] [[Douglas DC-3|DC3]] plane in the air with no survivors.<ref>{{cite web |title=ASN Aircraft accident Douglas R4D-1 (DC-3) VR-AAN Wadi Rabtah |url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19661122-0 |website=aviation-safety.net |access-date=1 January 2024}}</ref>

The increased violence was a determining factor in the British ensuring all families were evacuated more quickly than initially intended, as recorded in ''From Barren Rocks to Living Stones''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/8026228-from-barren-rocks-to-living-stones | title=From Barren Rocks...to Living Stones | access-date=30 January 2022 | archive-date=30 January 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220130142421/https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/8026228-from-barren-rocks-to-living-stones | url-status=live }}</ref>

On 30 November 1967, British troops were evacuated, leaving Aden and the rest of the FSA under NLF control. The [[Royal Marines]], who had been the first British troops to arrive in Aden in 1839, were the last to leave ‚Äì with the exception of a [[Royal Engineers|Royal Engineer]] detachment ([[10th Field Squadron (United Kingdom)|10 Airfields Squadron]] left Aden on 13 December 1967).

{{see also|South Yemen}}The last British soldier left Aden on November 30, 1967, and the [[National Liberation Front (South Yemen)|National Liberation Front]] had the upper hand at the expense of the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen, whose members were divided between joining the National Front or leaving for North Yemen, so Abdullah Al-Asanj and Muhammad Basindwa left for North Yemen.<ref>Al-Hawadess, 1977 ''Events, Issues 20-33'' p.187</ref> Qahtan al-Sha'bi assumed the presidency of the new state, and the sheikhdoms of the Eastern Protectorate of Hadramaut and Al-Mahra were annexed to the new state. Al-Shaabi took over a new country with a collapsed economy. Civilian workers and businessmen left, and English support stopped. The closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 played an important role in the country‚Äôs economy, as it reduced the number of ships crossing Aden by 75%.<ref>Noel Brehony ''Yemen Divided: The Story of a Failed State in South Arabia'' p.31</ref>

The new state was divided into six governorates on December 11, 1967, in order to end the manifestations of tribalism in the state and ignore the tribal borders between the defunct sheikhdoms.<ref>Noel Brehony ''Yemen Divided: The Story of a Failed State in South Arabia'' p.34</ref> On March 20, 1968, Qahtan dismissed all leftist leaders from the government and party membership.

Qahtan al-Shaabi dismissed Interior Minister Muhammad Ali Haitham on June 16, 1969, but the latter, with his ties to the tribes and the army, reassembled the leftist forces that had been dispersed by President Qahtan al-Shaabi, and they were able to arrest him and place him under house arrest on June 22 of the same year.<ref>Fred Haliday ''Revolution and Foreign Policy: The Case of South Yemen, 1967-1987'' p.25</ref> A presidential committee was formed from Five people: Salem Rabie Ali, who became president, Muhammad Saleh Al-Awlaki, Ali Antar, Abdel Fattah Ismail, and Muhammad Ali Haitham, who became prime minister.

West Germany severed its relationship with the state due to its recognition of East Germany, and the United States also severed its relationship in October 1969. The new powers issued a new constitution, nationalized foreign banks and insurance companies, and changed the name of the country.

Salem Rabie Ali wanted to adopt a practical approach, so he communicated with the President of North Yemen, Ibrahim al-Hamdi, and he wanted normal relations with Western countries.

With the [[Yemeni unification|unification]] of [[Yemen Arab Republic|northern]] and southern Yemen in 1990, Aden was no longer a national capital but remained the capital of ''Aden Governorate'' which covered an area similar to that of the Aden Colony.

On 29 December 1992, [[Al Qaeda]] conducted its first known [[terrorism|terrorist]] attack in Aden, bombing the [[Gold Mohur Hotel]], where US servicemen were known to have been staying en route to [[Somalia]] for [[Operation Restore Hope]].

That war marked the end of the state of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, and [[Haidar Abu Bakr al-Attas|Haider Abu Bakr Al-Attas]] assumed the presidency until May 22, 1990, the [[Yemeni unification|unity of South Yemen with North Yemen]], and the establishment of the Republic of Yemen.

Conflicts began within the ruling coalition, and Vice President Ali Salem Al-Beidh retreated to Aden in August 1993. The general security situation in the country deteriorated, and the complete integration of the two armies failed. The southern forces, which were transferred to [['Amran Governorate|Amran]], clashed with the northern forces there, and the forces of the northern giants, which were transferred to Amran, clashed. Abyan with the southern forces, and the political parties signed the [[1994 Covenant and Agreement]], in the Jordanian capital, on February 20, 1994, in an attempt to end the crisis, and successive events led to the outbreak of the Summer [[Yemeni Civil War (1994)|1994 civil war]], and the southern military leaders who fled after the events of 1986 joined the ranks of the forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, and supported the Unity Army in the war against their former comrades in 1994 in the war against the separatists.<ref>[http://yemen24news.blogspot.com/2012/02/hadi-elected-as-yemen-new-president.html "Hadi elected as Yemen new president", February 25, 2012] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019235638/http://yemen24news.blogspot.com/2012/02/hadi-elected-as-yemen-new-president.html|date=19 ÿ£ŸÉÿ™Ÿàÿ®ÿ± 2017}}</ref> At the forefront of these emerged a group of the brightest officers, such as President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi, who became Minister of Defense at the time, the former Chief of Staff, Major General Abdullah Aliwa, and Major General Salem Qatan, who was assassinated by a Al-Qaeda gunman.

=== Temporary capital and civil war ===
{{Main|Yemeni Revolution|Yemeni crisis (2011‚Äìpresent)|2018 Yemeni coup d'√©tat}}
Aden remained in a state of political stagnation for 25 years until President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi took refuge there and carried out his work from the Republican Palace in Aden. Hadi declared Aden the temporary capital on March 7, 2015, instead of Sana‚Äôa, which he described as occupied by the Houthis. This was after the Houthis took control of Sanaa on September 21, 2015, and imposed a siege on the Republican Palace and the home of President Hadi on January 20. Hadi submitted his resignation on January 22 to Parliament, which did not hold a session to accept or reject the resignation, and Hadi remained under house arrest imposed by the Houthis. Until he was able to leave for Aden on February 21, 2015, he retracted his resignation, and announced a statement in which he said, ‚ÄúAll decisions taken since September 21 are invalid and have no legitimacy.‚Äù

President [[Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi]] fled to Aden, his hometown, in February 2015 after being deposed in the [[2014‚Äì15 Yemeni coup d'√©tat|coup d'√©tat]] that many consider to be the start of the [[Yemeni Civil War (2014‚Äìpresent)|Yemeni civil war]]. Others consider that the civil war began in September 2014 when Houthi forces [[Battle of Sanaa (2014)|took over the capital city Sana'a]], which was followed by a rapid [[Houthi takeover in Yemen|Houthi takeover of the government]].

Hadi declared in Aden that he was still Yemen's legitimate president and called on state institutions and loyal officials to relocate to Aden.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2015/Feb-26/288841-head-of-gcc-visits-embattled-hadi-in-aden.ashx |agency=The Daily Star |title=Head of GCC visits embattled Hadi in Aden |date=26 February 2015 |access-date=26 February 2015 |archive-date=19 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210319131640/https://www.dailystar.com.lb/scripts/xgemius.js |url-status=live }}</ref> In a televised speech on 21 March 2015, he declared Aden to be Yemen's "economic and temporary capital" while [[Sana'a]] is controlled by the [[Houthis]].<ref name="dw">{{cite news |date=21 March 2015 |title=Yemen's President Hadi declares new 'temporary capital' |agency=Deutsche Welle |url=http://www.dw.de/yemens-president-hadi-declares-new-temporary-capital/a-18332197 |access-date=21 March 2015 |archive-date=5 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150605210805/http://www.dw.de/yemens-president-hadi-declares-new-temporary-capital/a-18332197 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The entry of the Yemenis into Islam contributed to their abandoning their ancient pen and replacing it with the late Nabataean alphabet in which the Qur‚Äôan was written.{{Efn|Jawad Ali says: It appears from researchers finding writings written in the Musnad in various places in the Arabian Peninsula, including the coasts of the Arabian Gulf, some of which are ancient and some of which are close to Islam, that the Musnad pen was the authentic and first Arabic pen among the Arabs. All the people of the Arabian Peninsula wrote about it, but the Christian preaching that entered the Arabian Peninsula and spread in various places brought with it the late Armenian pen, the pen of the Eastern churches, and began spreading it among the people. Because it was his sacred pen with which the clerics used to write. Since this pen was easier to write than the musnad, it found widespread followers among those who converted to Christianity and among pagans as well, due to its ease of writing. However, it was not able to eliminate the musnad as people continued to write with it. When Islam came, the scribes wrote the revelation with the pen of the people of Mecca so that the revelation would descend among them. The Mecca pen became the official pen for the Muslims, and Al-Musnad was then sentenced to death. He died and was forgotten by the Arabs, until the Orientalists resurrected him and brought him back to existence again, to translate for us the ordinary writings that were recorded in him.

==== Pre-independence ====
The first beginning of Adenian sports dates back to the year 1902 AD, when the Adeni Tennis Club was established, with its headquarters in the Al-Qatee‚Äô neighborhood in Crater, and Youssef Muhammad Khan founded the ‚ÄúRecreational Club United‚Äù in the city of Crater, and it was known as the Yousef Khan Stadium. The city of Aden is considered the first city in which sports were practiced in the Arabian Peninsula, and the first private club in Aden was founded in 1905 under the name ‚ÄúAl-Ittihad Al-Muhammadi Club,‚Äù as the first sports club in Yemen and the Arab world. He was fighting the occupation army divisions and the fleet divisions coming and passing to the port of Aden.<ref name="adenalghad.net">[https://adengad.net/news/6987/#.VPWfDPmsUdo#ixzz3TKOWGgRE ŸÖŸÜ ÿ∞ÿßŸÉÿ±ÿ© ÿπÿØŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ±Ÿäÿßÿ∂Ÿäÿ© .. ÿßŸÑÿ±ŸäÿßÿØÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ≤ŸÖŸÜŸäÿ© ŸÑŸÑŸÉÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπÿØŸÜŸäÿ©] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402154448/http://adenalghad.net/news/6987/|date=02 ÿ£ÿ®ÿ±ŸäŸÑ 2015}}</ref>

In 1924, the ‚ÄúAl-Husseini Sports Club‚Äù was founded in Crater, and a third club appeared in Tawahi under the name ‚ÄúAl-Bamboot Club‚Äù and Sheikh Othman. The 1930s witnessed the emergence of a number of clubs. In 1933 AD, the ‚ÄúNujoom Al-Layl Club‚Äù, Al-Aidrousi Club, and Nujoom Al-Sabah Club appeared in Crater, and in Tawahi, the ‚ÄúAl-Ittihad Al-Islami Club‚Äù (Al-Mawlada) appeared.<ref name="adenalghad.net2">[https://adengad.net/news/6987/#.VPWfDPmsUdo#ixzz3TKOWGgRE ŸÖŸÜ ÿ∞ÿßŸÉÿ±ÿ© ÿπÿØŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ±Ÿäÿßÿ∂Ÿäÿ© .. ÿßŸÑÿ±ŸäÿßÿØÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ≤ŸÖŸÜŸäÿ© ŸÑŸÑŸÉÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπÿØŸÜŸäÿ©] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402154448/http://adenalghad.net/news/6987/|date=02 ÿ£ÿ®ÿ±ŸäŸÑ 2015}}</ref>

Until that year, football matches were played in a friendly manner between the teams of the Crater, Al-Tawahi, and Sheikh Othman regions, as there were no federations regulating sports activity. In 1934 AD, the occupation authority announced the establishment of a sports association called the ‚ÄúAdeniya Sports Association,‚Äù after the increasing number of local clubs. Its members were appointed by the Governor-General of Aden, and all of its members were English, headed by the English Governor of Aden, ‚ÄúBernard Reilly,‚Äù as sponsor. The association's board of directors consists of Hikam Bottom as president, the Indian Rosario as secretary, and two other members.

This association began holding the first club tournament, which was the ‚ÄúRosario Cup Championship.‚Äù Six clubs participated in the tournament, three from Crater (Al-Ittihad Al-Mohammadi, Al-Husseini, and Nojoom Al-Layl), from Al-Tawahi (Al-Mawalda, and Al-Bamiot), and from Sheikh Othman, Sheikh Othman Club, which includes Players from various small teams in the Sheikh Othman area, and Al-Ittihad Al-Mohammadi Club won this championship.

Among the most important tournaments held in Aden before independence were the Rosario Cup, the Riley Cup, the Somali Bassem Al-Nar Cup, the Aramco Cup, and the Kik Muncherji Championship.

=== Post-independence ===
After independence, the ‚ÄúFootball Federation‚Äù was established on January 18, 1968, on the ruins of the ‚ÄúAdeniya Sports Association.‚Äù The Federation took a decision regarding the Adeniya clubs, which had numbered about 64 sports clubs, reducing and merging the clubs in Aden and Lahj to only 16 clubs, and the clubs were forced to join or unite with large teams. In February 1968, several sports clubs were abolished, leaving only 12 clubs remaining. In December 1968, Al-Islah Club and Al-Shaab Club were merged into one club under the name of the latter in Al-Tawahi. In 1969, the Al-Ittihad Al-Muhammadi Club and Al-Tadamon Club were united in [[Crater (Aden)|Crater]], under the name Al-Tadamon Al-Muhammadi Club.{{Fact|date=February 2024}}

In the ‚ÄúFirst General Sports Conference‚Äù in 1973, the clubs were merged and reduced again, so that their number became only 7 clubs: Al-Ahrar Club, Al-Ahly Club, Shamsan Club, Al-Shaab Club, Al-Hilal Club, United Youth Club, and Aden Tennis Club. On July 18, 1975, the stage of forming urban clubs, and the beginning of the stage of politicization of the clubs in favor of the National Liberation Front, took place. It was decided to change their names and reduce them to become 5 clubs: Al-Tilal Club, Shamsan Club, Al-Minaa Club, Al-Wahda Club, and Al-Shoula Club.{{Fact|date=February 2024}}

On July 18, 1975, the ‚ÄúAl-Tilal Sports Club‚Äù appeared, headed by Yassin Saeed Noman, as a new name for the ‚ÄúAl-Ittihad Al-Muhammadi Club,‚Äù which was founded in 1905, and in 1976 the ‚ÄúYemeni Football Federation‚Äù appeared. Al-Tilal Club participated in the ‚ÄúSeptember 26 Cup Competition‚Äù in 1980, as the first football competition in which it participated with teams from northern and southern Yemen, such as the national team of Ibb Governorate, Taiz Governorate, Hadhramaut Governorate, Lahj and Hodeidah, at the Shaheed Al-Dharafi Stadium in Sana‚Äôa, and Al-Hilal was crowned champion of the September 26 Cup, after victory over Hodeidah national team by five clean goals.<ref>http://www.al-tilalclub.net ÿßŸÑŸÖŸàŸÇÿπ ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ≥ŸÖŸä ŸÑŸÜÿßÿØŸä ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸÑÿßŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ±Ÿäÿßÿ∂Ÿä {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922003010/http://al-tilalclub.net/|date=2017-09-22}}</ref>

*Main Pass ‚Äì now called Al-Aqba Road is the only road into Aden through Crater. Originally an Arched Upper bridge known as Main Gate, it overlooked Aden city and was built during the Ottoman Empire. A painted crest of the 24th British army battalion is still visible on the brickwork adjacent to the Gate site and is believed to be the only remaining army Crest from colonial rule still visible in Aden. In March 1963 the bridge was removed by a British Army controlled explosion to widen the 2 lane roadway to the present 4 lane highway and the only reminder of this bridge is a quarter scale replica built at the end of the Al-Aqba road intersection known as the AdenGate Model roundabout.

The industrial activity in Aden is represented by a group of factories and production units, the forefront of which is the oil refinery. The oil refinery in Aden is considered one of the first refineries to be established in the region, and began operating in 1954 AD. The Aden Refineries Company has facilities such as an oil tanker port, a network of storage tanks, and a center to supply ships with fuel.<ref name="ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸÜÿ¥ÿ∑ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿßŸÇÿ™ÿµÿßÿØŸäÿ© ŸÑŸÖÿ≠ÿßŸÅÿ∏ÿ© ÿπÿØŸÜ">{{cite web |access-date=2015-03-02 |archive-date=9 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009160110/http://www.yemen-nic.info:80/gover/aden/actionecnom/ |title=ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸÜÿ¥ÿ∑ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿßŸÇÿ™ÿµÿßÿØŸäÿ© ŸÑŸÖÿ≠ÿßŸÅÿ∏ÿ© ÿπÿØŸÜ |url=https://yemen-nic.info/gover/aden/actionecnom/}}<!-- auto-translated from Arabic by Module:CS1 translator --></ref>

Historically, Aden was a station for importing goods from the African coast and from Europe, the United States, and India. As of 1920, Aden was a major commercial center for trade in the Arabian Peninsula, and the port exported small quantities of local products to most Arab ports. Aden provided coal and salt to passing ships, and the port was a stopping point for ships when they entered Bab al-Mandab.

=== Transport ===
[[File:Aden03 flickr.jpg|thumb|right|Aden's harbour in 1960]]Historically, the port of Aden was the main transport port in the region. Passenger ships land in Al-Tawahi District, and the city is served by Aden International Airport, which is about 10 kilometers (6 mi) from the city. The airport is the main headquarters of Al-Saeeda Airlines and its operations center. The airport is considered the second largest airport. In Yemen, after Sana'a International Airport, it is considered the best airport in Yemen in terms of location due to the mountainous nature of Yemen. However, this airport is surrounded by the Arabian Sea in terms of take-off and landing. The establishment of Aden Airport dates back to the year 1927 when the British forces established a military airport in the district. Khor Maksar. After World War II, Britain carried out extensive urban modernization and built Aden International Airport, known today, next to the military airport. [[Alyemda|Al-Yamda]] Airlines was the official carrier of South Yemen, before unification, and was based in Aden, before merging with Yemen Airways in 1996. Before the [[Battle of Aden Airport]] and the [[2015 military intervention in Yemen]] closed this airport along with other airports in Yemen.  On 22 July, Aden International Airport was declared fit for operation again after the Houthi forces were driven from the city, and a Saudi plane carrying aid reportedly became the first plane to land in Aden in four months.<ref>{{cite news |date=22 July 2015 |title=Aden Airport ready to operate |url=http://www.yementimes.com/?liveblog.item.id=64 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211102822/http://www.yementimes.com/?liveblog.item.id=64 |archive-date=11 February 2017 |access-date=27 July 2015 |work=[[Yemen Times]]}}</ref> The same day, a ship chartered by the [[World Food Programme]] carrying fuel docked in Aden's port.<ref>{{cite news |date=22 July 2015 |title=New WFP Ship Arrives in Aden Port With Fuel For Humanitarian Operations |url=https://www.wfp.org/news/news-release/new-wfp-ship-arrives-aden-port-fuel-humanitarian-operations |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150809074355/http://www.wfp.org/news/news-release/new-wfp-ship-arrives-aden-port-fuel-humanitarian-operations |archive-date=9 August 2015 |access-date=30 July 2015 |work=World Food Programme |publisher=United Nations}}</ref>

Historically, Aden's [[harbour]] has been a major hub of transportation for the region. As of 1920, the harbour was {{convert|8|by|4|mi|abbr=on|order=flip|km|0}} in size. Passenger ships landed at Steamer Point now called [[Tawahi (Aden)|Tawahi]].<ref name="Prothero682">{{cite book |last=Prothero |first=G.W. |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11767/view/1/68/ |title=Arabia |publisher=H.M.

And also to export frankincense, wheat, barley, alfalfa and millet, which are produced and exported from Aden. The leaves and stems of clover, millet, and corn produced in Aden were generally used as fodder. Beginning in 1920, Aden was desalinating seawater to produce table salt. Between 1916 and 1917, Aden produced more than 120,000 tons of salt. Aden also produced potash, which was exported to Mumbai.

[[File:Location_of_Adan.svg|right|thumb|240x240px|Aden's location in Yemen]]
Aden is located on the coast of the Gulf of Aden, and is about 363 kilometers away from the capital, Sana‚Äôa. It is located between latitudes 47 and 12 north of the equator, and at an altitude of 6 meters above sea level. It is surrounded by Lahj Governorate to the north and east, and the Governorate of Abyan is from the northwest, and Aden has an air port represented by Aden International Airport, and a sea port represented by the port of Aden, and it has land routes from the north linking it to Hajj, Abyan and Taiz.

=== Landforms ===
The city of Aden is a coastal city, as it overlooks a large body of water, the Gulf of Aden, which in turn opens to the Indian Ocean. The shape of the city of Aden in the form of two peninsulas helped this factor to make the city of Aden unique in this particularity, which clearly affected the occurrence of the phenomenon of land and sea breezes. Which occurs due to air exchange between land and water during the day and night. Its location on the water surface also affects the daily and annual temperature range. This does not mean that there are no significant differences in temperatures in summer and winter.<ref>{{cite web |access-date=2015-03-02 |archive-date=17 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181017030355/http://www.yemen-nic.info:80/gover/aden/brife/ |title=ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ±ŸÉÿ≤ ÿßŸÑŸàÿ∑ŸÜŸä ŸÑŸÑŸÖÿπŸÑŸàŸÖÿßÿ™ ŸÜÿ®ÿ∞ÿ© ÿ™ÿπÿ±ŸäŸÅŸäÿ© ÿπŸÜ ŸÖÿ≠ÿßŸÅÿ∏ÿ© ÿπÿØŸÜ |url=https://yemen-nic.info/gover/aden/brife/}}<!-- auto-translated from Arabic by Module:CS1 translator --></ref>

The surface of the city of Aden slopes south, and the highlands appear in the southern part of Aden, represented by the highlands of Jabal Shamsan, whose highest peaks exceed 500 metres, and the highlands of Jabal Ihsan and Jabal Al-Muzalqim in Little Aden, which are lower in height than Jabal Shamsan, and the highlands of Aden do not differ from the rest of the highlands of Yemen in terms of In terms of composition, it is of volcanic origin, and although the mountain highlands occupy large areas of the city, their influence is weak and limited on the climate of the city of Aden.

=== Climate ===
Aden has a [[hot desert climate]] (BWh) in the [[K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification system]]. Although Aden sees next to no precipitation year-round, it is humid throughout the year.
