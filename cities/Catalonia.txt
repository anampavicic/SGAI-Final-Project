Modern-day Catalonia comprises most of the medieval and early modern [[Principality of Catalonia]] (with the remainder [[Northern Catalonia|northern area]] now part of France's [[Pyrénées-Orientales]]). It is bordered by [[France]] ([[Occitania (administrative region)|Occitanie]]) and [[Andorra]] to the north, the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the east, and the Spanish autonomous communities of [[Aragon]] to the west and [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] to the south. In addition to about 580&nbsp;km of coastline, Catalonia also has major high landforms such as the [[Pyrenees]] and the [[Pre-Pyrenees]], the Transversal Range (Serralada Transversal) or the Central Depression.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://exteriors.gencat.cat/en/ambits-dactuacio/afers_exteriors/delegacions_govern/welcome-to-catalonia/|title=Welcome to Catalonia|publisher=Ministry for Foreign Action and European Union|access-date=27 March 2024|archive-date=27 March 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240327072043/https://exteriors.gencat.cat/en/ambits-dactuacio/afers_exteriors/delegacions_govern/welcome-to-catalonia/|url-status=live}}</ref> The official languages are [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and the [[Aranese dialect]] of [[Occitan language|Occitan]].<ref name="estatut_langs">{{cite web|title=Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia (2006), Articles 6, 50 – BOPC 224 |url=http://www.parlament-cat.net/porteso/estatut/estatut_angles_100506.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826045656/http://www.parlament-cat.net/porteso/estatut/estatut_angles_100506.pdf|archive-date=26 August 2013|access-date=31 January 2014}}</ref>

In the late 8th century, various counties across the eastern Pyrenees were established by the [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish kingdom]] as a defensive barrier against Muslim invasions. In the 10th century, the County of Barcelona became progressively independent.<ref>Salrach, Josep Mª. ''Catalunya a la fi del primer mil·leni''. Pagès Editors (Lleida, 2004), pp. 144–149.</ref> In 1137, [[County of Barcelona|Barcelona]] and the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] were united by marriage, resulting in a [[composite monarchy]] known as the [[Crown of Aragon]]. Within the Crown, the Catalan counties merged in to a polity, the [[Principality of Catalonia]], developing its own institutional system, such as [[Catalan Courts]], [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Generalitat]] and [[Catalan constitutions|constitutions]], becoming the base and promoter for the Crown's Mediterranean trade and expansionism. In the later Middle Ages, [[Catalan literature]] flourished. In 1469, [[Catholic Monarchs of Spain|the monarchs]] of the crowns of Aragon and [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] were married and ruled their realms together, retaining all of their distinct institutions and legislation.

During the [[Franco-Spanish War (1635–59)|Franco-Spanish War]] (1635–1659), [[Reapers' War|the Principality of Catalonia revolted]] (1640–1652) against a burdensome presence of the royal army, being briefly established as a [[Catalan Republic (1640–1641)|republic]] under French protection. By the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] (1659), the [[Northern Catalonia|northern parts of Catalonia]], mostly the [[County of Roussillon|Roussillon]], were ceded to France. During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701–1714), the Crown of Aragon sided against the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] [[Philip V of Spain]], but after the [[Peace of Utrecht]] (1713) the Catalans were defeated with the [[Siege of Barcelona (1713–1714)|capitulation of Barcelona]] on [[National Day of Catalonia|11 September 1714]]. Philip V subsequently imposed a unifying administration across Spain, enacting the [[Nueva Planta decrees]] which, like in the other realms of the Crown of Aragon, suppressed Catalan institutions and legislation. As a consequence, Catalan as a language of government and literature was eclipsed by Spanish.

In the 19th century, Catalonia was severely affected by the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] and [[Carlist Wars]]. In the second third of the century, it experienced industrialisation. As wealth from the industrial expansion grew, it saw a [[Renaixença|cultural renaissance]] coupled with incipient [[Catalan nationalism|nationalism]] while several [[workers' movement]]s appeared. The establishment of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] (1931–1939) granted [[Autonomous Region of Catalonia (1931-1939)|self-governance to Catalonia]], being restored the [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Generalitat]] as the autonomous government. After the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist]] dictatorship enacted repressive measures, abolishing Catalan self-government and banning the official use of the Catalan language. After a period of [[autarky]], from the late 1950s through to the 1970s Catalonia saw [[Spanish miracle|rapid economic growth]], drawing many workers from across Spain, making Barcelona one of Europe's largest industrial metropolitan areas and turning Catalonia into a major tourist destination. During the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] (1975–1982), the Generalitat was reestablished and Catalonia [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1979|regained self-government]], remaining one of the most economically dynamic communities in Spain.

In the 2010s, there was growing support for [[Catalan independence movement|Catalan independence]]. On 27 October 2017, the Catalan Parliament unilaterally declared independence following a [[2017 Catalan independence referendum|referendum]] that was deemed unconstitutional by the Spanish state. The Spanish Senate voted in favour of enforcing direct rule by removing the Catalan government and calling [[2017 Catalan regional election|a snap regional election]]. The [[Spanish Supreme Court]] imprisoned seven former ministers of the Catalan government on charges of rebellion and misuse of public funds, while several others—including then-President [[Carles Puigdemont]]—fled to other European countries. Those in prison{{Efn|Puigdemont is still wanted by the government in Madrid.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2022-05-24|title=EU court reinstates MEP immunity of Catalonia's Carles Puigdemont|url=https://www.euronews.com/2022/05/24/eu-court-reinstates-immunity-of-catalonia-s-ex-president-carles-puigdemont|access-date=2022-06-22|publisher=[[euronews]]|language=en|archive-date=22 June 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220622190654/https://www.euronews.com/2022/05/24/eu-court-reinstates-immunity-of-catalonia-s-ex-president-carles-puigdemont|url-status=live}}</ref>}} were pardoned by the Spanish government in 2021.

== Etymology and pronunciation ==
The name "Catalonia" ({{Langx|la-x-medieval|Cathalaunia}}), spelled ''Cathalonia'', began to be used for the homeland of the [[Catalans]] (''Cathalanenses'') in the late 11th century and was probably used before as a territorial reference to the group of counties that comprised part of the March of Gothia and the [[Marca Hispanica|March of Hispania]] under the control of the [[Count of Barcelona]] and his relatives.<ref>[http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0016436 Enciclopèdia Catalana online: Catalunya ("Geral de Cataluign, Raimundi Catalan and Arnal Catalan appear in 1107/1112")] (in Catalan) {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206211826/http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0016436|date=6 February 2012}}</ref> The origin of the name ''Catalunya'' is subject to diverse interpretations because of a lack of evidence.

One theory suggests that ''Catalunya'' derives from the name ''Gothia'' (or ''Gauthia'') ''Launia'' ("Land of the [[Goths]]"), since the origins of the Catalan counts, lords and people were found in the March of Gothia, known as ''Gothia'', whence ''Gothland'' > {{Lang|la-x-medieval|Gothlandia}} > {{Lang|la-x-medieval|Gothalania}} > {{Lang|la-x-medieval|Cathalaunia}} > ''Catalonia'' theoretically derived.<ref name="Books.google.com"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Ulick Ralph Burke|title=A history of Spain from the earliest times to the death of Ferdinand the Catholic|url=https://archive.org/details/ahistoryspainfr02burkgoog|year=1900|publisher=Longmans, Green, and co.|page=[https://archive.org/details/ahistoryspainfr02burkgoog/page/n187 154]}}</ref> During the [[Middle Ages]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] chroniclers claimed that ''Catalania'' derives from the local medley of [[Goths]] with [[Alans]], initially constituting a ''Goth-Alania''.<ref>The Sarmatians: 600 BC-AD 450 (Men-at-Arms) by Richard Brzezinski and Gerry Embleton, 19 August 2002.</ref>

Other theories suggest:

*''Catalunya'' derives from the term "land of castles", having evolved from the term ''castlà'' or ''castlan'', the medieval term for a [[castellan]] (a ruler of a [[castle]]).<ref name="Books.google.com">{{cite book|author=Maximiano García Venero|title=Historia del nacionalismo catalán: 2a edición|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nUABAAAAMAAJ|access-date=25 April 2010|date=7 July 2006|publisher=Ed.

[[File:Cogul HBreuil.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Roca dels Moros]] contains paintings protected as part of the Rock art of the [[Iberian language|Iberian]] Mediterranean Basin, a [[World Heritage Site]].]]

The first known human settlements in what is now Catalonia were at the beginning of the [[Middle Paleolithic]]. The oldest known trace of human occupation is a [[mandible]] found in [[Banyoles]], described by some sources{{which|date=December 2022}} as pre-[[Neanderthal]], that is, some 200,000 years old; other sources suggest it to be only about one third that old.<ref>{{citation|first1=R.|last1=Grun|title=ESR and U-series analyses of enamel and dentine fragments of the Banyoles mandible|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|year=2005|url=http://www.naturalsciences.be/mars/litterature/bibliography/bibtest/Grun2005|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120904090837/http://www.naturalsciences.be/mars/litterature/bibliography/bibtest/Grun2005|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 September 2012|access-date=31 October 2006|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2005.10.001|display-authors=etal|volume=50|issue=3|pages=347–58|pmid=16364406}}.</ref> From the next prehistoric era, the [[Epipalaeolithic]] or [[Mesolithic]], important remains survive, the greater part dated between 8000 and 5000{{spaces}}BC, such as those of Sant Gregori ([[Falset, Tarragona|Falset]]) and el Filador ([[Margalef]] de Montsant). The most important sites from these eras, all excavated in the region of [[Moianès]], are the Balma del Gai (Epipaleolithic) and the Balma de l'Espluga (late Epipaleolithic and Early Neolithic).<ref>Guilaine, Jean; Michel Barbaza, David Geddes, Jean-Louis Vernet, Miguel Llongueras & Maria Hopf (1982). "Prehistoric Human Adaptations in Catalonia (Spain)", ''Journal of Field Archaeology'', 9:4, 407–416.</ref>

The [[Neolithic]] era began in Catalonia around 5000{{nbsp}}BC, although the population was slower to develop fixed settlements than in other places, thanks to the abundance of woods, which allowed the continuation of a fundamentally [[hunter-gatherer]] culture. An example of such settlements would be La Draga at Banyoles, an "early Neolithic village which dates from the end of the 6th millennium{{nbsp}}BC."<ref>Tarrus, Josep. "La Draga (Banyoles, Catalonia), an Early Neolithic Lakeside Village in Mediterranean Europe". ''Catalan Historical Review'', vol. 1, 2008, pp. 17–33.</ref>

The [[Chalcolithic]] period developed in Catalonia between 2500 and 1800{{nbsp}}BC, with the beginning of the construction of copper objects. The [[Bronze Age]] occurred between 1800 and 700{{nbsp}}BC. There are few remnants of this era, but there were some known settlements in the [[Segre (river)|low Segre]] zone. The Bronze Age coincided with the arrival of the [[proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]] through the [[Urnfield Culture]], whose successive waves of migration began around 1200{{nbsp}}BC, and they were responsible for the creation of the first proto-urban settlements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raco.cat/index.php/Pyrenae/article/viewFile/178964/242576|title=J.

=== Pre-Roman and Roman period ===
[[File:PuentedelDiablo edited.jpg|thumb|[[Les Ferreres Aqueduct|Aqüeducte de les Ferreres]], [[Roman aqueduct]] in [[Tarragona]] ]]
In pre-Roman times, the area that is now called Catalonia in the north-east of [[Iberian Peninsula]] – like the rest of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] side of the peninsula – was populated by the [[Iberians]]. The Iberians of this area – the [[Ilergetes]], [[Indigetes]] and [[Lacetani]] (Cerretains) – also maintained relations with the peoples of the Mediterranean. Some urban agglomerations became relevant, including Ilerda ([[Lleida]]) inland, Hibera (perhaps [[Amposta]] or [[Tortosa]]) or Indika ([[Ullastret]]). Coastal trading colonies were established by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], who settled around the [[Gulf of Roses]], in Emporion ([[Empúries]]) and [[Roses, Girona|Roses]] in the [[Colonies in antiquity|8th century BC]]. The [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] briefly ruled the territory in the course of the [[Second Punic War]] and traded with [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|the surrounding Iberian population]].

After the Carthaginian defeat by the [[Roman Republic]], the north-east of Iberia became the first to come under Roman rule and became part of [[Hispania]], the westernmost part of the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Tarraco (Tarragona)|Tarraco]] (modern [[Tarragona]]) was one of the most important Roman cities in Hispania and the capital of the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Tarraconensis]]. Other important cities of the Roman period are Ilerda (Lleida), Dertosa (Tortosa), Gerunda (Girona) as well as the ports of Empuriæ (former Emporion) and Barcino ([[Barcelona]]). As for the rest of Hispania, [[Latin law]] was granted to all cities under the reign of [[Vespasian]] (69–79{{nbsp}}AD), while [[Roman citizenship]] was granted to all free men of the empire by the [[Edict of Caracalla]] in 212{{nbsp}}AD (Tarraco, the capital, was already a colony of [[Roman law]] since 45{{nbsp}}BC). It was a rich agricultural province (olive oil, wine, [[wheat]]), and the first centuries of the Empire saw the construction of roads (the most important being the [[Via Augusta]], parallel to Mediterranean coastline) and infrastructure like [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]].

Conversion to [[Christianity]], attested in the 3rd{{nbsp}}century, was completed in urban areas in the 4th{{nbsp}}century. Although Hispania remained under Roman rule and did not fall under the rule of [[Vandals]], [[Suebi]] and [[Alans]] in the 5th{{nbsp}}century, the main cities suffered frequent sacking and some [[deurbanization]].

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Origen de l'escut del comtat de Barcelona de Lorenzale.jpg|thumb|right|''Origins of the blason of the County of Barcelona'', by [[Claudi Lorenzale]] ]]
After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the area was conquered by the [[Visigoths]] and was ruled as part of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] for almost two and a half centuries. In 718, it came under [[Muslim]] control and became part of [[Al-Andalus]], a province of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. From the conquest of Roussillon in 760, to the [[Siege of Barcelona (801)|conquest]] of Barcelona in 801, the [[Frankish empire]] took control of the area between Septimania and the [[Llobregat]] river from the Muslims and created heavily militarised, self-governing [[county|counties]]. These counties formed part of the historiographically known as the [[Septimania|Gothic]] and [[Spanish March|Hispanic]] Marches, a [[buffer zone]] in the south of the Frankish Empire in the former province of Septimania and in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula, to act as a defensive barrier for the Frankish Empire against further Muslim invasions from Al-Andalus.<ref>Ramos, Luis G-G (2002).

These counties came under the rule of the [[counts of Barcelona]], who were Frankish [[vassal]]s nominated by the emperor of the Franks, to whom they were [[feudatory|feudatories]] (801–988). The earliest known use of the name "[[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]]" for these counties dates to 1117. At the end of the 9th{{nbsp}}century, the Count of Barcelona [[Wilfred the Hairy]] (878–897) made his titles hereditaries and thus founded the dynasty of the [[House of Barcelona]], which reigned in Catalonia until 1410.

[[File:Cortes Catalanas.jpg|thumb|upright|A 15th-century miniature of the Catalan Courts]]
In 988 [[Borrell II]], Count of Barcelona, did not recognise the new French king [[Hugh Capet]] as his king, evidencing the loss of dependency from Frankish rule and confirming his successors (from [[Ramon Borrell, Count of Barcelona|Ramon Borrell I]] onwards) as independent of the Capetian crown whom they regarded as usurpers of the Carolingian Frankish realm.<ref>Salrach, Josep Mª. ''Catalunya a la fi del primer mil·leni''. Pagès Editors, (Lleida, 2004) pp. 144–49.</ref> At the beginning of eleventh century the Catalan counties experienced an important process of feudalisation, however, the efforts of church's sponsored [[Peace and Truce of God|Peace and Truce Assemblies]] and the intervention of [[Ramon Berenguer I]], count of Barcelona (1035–1076) in the negotiations with the rebel nobility resulted in the partial restoration of the comital authority under the new feudal order. To fulfill that purpose, Ramon Berenguer began the modification of the legislation in the written [[Usages of Barcelona]], being one of the first European compilations of feudal law.

In 1137, [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona]] decided to accept [[Ramiro II of Aragon|King Ramiro II of Aragon]]'s proposal to receive the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] and to marry his daughter [[Petronilla of Aragon|Petronila]], establishing the dynastic union of the County of Barcelona with Aragon, creating a composite monarchy later known as the [[Crown of Aragon]] and making the Catalan counties that were vassalized or merged with the County of Barcelona into a [[principality]] of the Aragonese Crown. During the reign of his son [[Alfonso II of Aragon|Alphons]], in 1173, Catalonia was regarded as a legal entity for the first time, while the Usages of Barcelona were compiled in the process to turn them into the law and custom of Catalonia (''Consuetudinem Cathalonie''), being considered one of the "milestones of Catalan political identity".<ref>Cingolani, Stefano Maria (2006).

In 1258, by means of the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)|Treaty of Corbeil]], [[James I of Aragon]] King of Aragon and [[Count of Barcelona]], king of Mallorca and of Valencia, renounced his family rights and dominions in [[Occitania]], while the king of France, [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], formally relinquished to any historical claim of feudal lordship he might have over the Catalan counties, except the [[County of Foix]], despite the opposition of king James.<ref name="Petit-Dutaillis2013">{{cite book|author=C.

As a coastal territory, Catalonia became the base of the Aragonese Crown's maritime forces, which spread the power of the Crown in the Mediterranean, turning Barcelona into a powerful and wealthy city. In the period of 1164–1410, new territories, the [[Kingdom of Valencia]], the [[Kingdom of Majorca]], the [[Kingdom of Sardinia (1324–1720)|Kingdom of Sardinia]], the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], and, briefly, the [[Duchy|Duchies]] of [[Duchy of Athens|Athens]] and [[Duchy of Neopatras|Neopatras]], were incorporated into the dynastic domains of the [[House of Barcelona|House of Aragon]]. The expansion was accompanied by a great development of the Catalan trade, creating an extensive trade network across the Mediterranean which competed with those of the maritime republics of [[Genoa Republic|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]].

At the same time, the [[Principality of Catalonia]] developed a complex institutional and political system based in the concept of a pact between the [[estates of the realm]] and the king. The legislation of Catalonia had to be passed the [[Catalan Courts]] (''Corts Catalanes''), one of the first parliamentary bodies of Europe that, since 1283, obtained the power to legislate with the monarch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://usuarios.multimania.es/maarian/Catalunya/historiacataluna/las_cortes_catalanas_.htm|title=Las Cortes Catalanas y la primera Generalidad medieval (s.

In order to collect general taxes, the Catalan Courts of 1359 established a permanent representative body, known as the "Deputation of the General" or [[Generalitat of Catalonia|Generalitat]], which gained considerable political power over the next centuries.<ref>[https://web.gencat.cat/ca/generalitat/historia/la-diputacio-del-general/ History of the Generalitat] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200916163434/https://web.gencat.cat/ca/generalitat/historia/la-diputacio-del-general/|date=16 September 2020}} gencat.cat</ref>

Between 1347 and 1497 Catalonia lost 37{{nbsp}}percent of its population.<ref>According to John Huxtable Elliott, "Between 1347 and 1497 the Principality [Catalonia] had lost 37% of its inhabitants, and was reduced to a population of something like 300,000." {{cite book|author=[[John Elliott (historian)|Elliott, John Huxtable]]|title=The revolt of the Catalans: a study in the decline of Spain (1598–1640) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X2Hf-crzPjUC&pg=PA26|year=1984|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-27890-2|page=26|access-date=9 November 2020|archive-date=11 March 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220311111240/https://books.google.com/books?id=X2Hf-crzPjUC&pg=PA26|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1410, the last reigning monarch of the House of Barcelona, King [[Martin of Aragon|Martin I]] died without surviving descendants.

The [[Sentencia Arbitral de Guadalupe]] (1486) liberated the [[Remensa|remença]] peasants from the feudal [[evil customs]].

In the later Middle Ages, [[Catalan literature]] flourished in Catalonia proper and in the kingdoms of Majorca and Valencia, with such remarkable authors as the philosopher [[Ramon Llull]], the Valencian poet [[Ausiàs March]], and [[Joanot Martorell]], author of the novel ''[[Tirant lo Blanch]]'', published in 1490.

[[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], the grandson of Ferdinand I, and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] were married in 1469, later taking the title the [[Catholic Monarchs]]; subsequently, this event was seen by historiographers as the dawn of a unified Spain. At this time, though united by marriage, the Crowns of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] maintained distinct territories, each keeping its own traditional institutions, parliaments, laws and currency.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Imperial Spain 1469–1716 |last=Huxtable|first=Elliott, J.

Over the next few centuries, the Principality of Catalonia was generally on the losing side of a series of wars that led steadily to an increased centralization of power in Spain. Despite this fact, between the 16th and 18th centuries, the participation of the political community in the local and the general Catalan government grew (thus consolidating its constitutional system), while the kings remained absent, represented by a [[List of viceroys of Catalonia|viceroy]]. Tensions between Catalan institutions and the monarchy began to arise. The large and burdensome presence of the Spanish royal army in the Principality due to the [[Franco-Spanish War (1635–1659)|Franco-Spanish War]] led to an uprising of peasants, provoking the [[Reapers' War]] (1640–1652), which saw Catalonia rebel (briefly as a [[Catalan Republic (1640–1641)|republic]] led by the president of the Generalitat, [[Pau Claris]]) with French help against the Spanish Crown for overstepping Catalonia's rights during the [[Thirty Years' War]].<ref>Gelderen, Martin van; Skinner, Quentin (2002).

The most significant conflict concerning the governing monarchy was the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701–1715), which began when the childless [[Charles II of Spain]], the last Spanish Habsburg, died without an heir in 1700. Charles II had chosen [[Philip V of Spain]] from the French [[House of Bourbon]]. Catalonia, like other territories that formed the Crown of Aragon, rose up in support of the Austrian Habsburg pretender [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]], in his claim for the Spanish throne as Charles III of Spain. The fight between the houses of Bourbon and Habsburg for the Spanish Crown split Spain and Europe.

The [[Siege of Barcelona (1713–14)|fall of Barcelona]] on 11 September 1714 to the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] king [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] militarily ended the Habsburg claim to the Spanish Crown, which became legal fact in the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. Philip felt that he had been betrayed by the Catalan Courts, as it had initially sworn its loyalty to him when he had presided over it in 1701. In retaliation for the betrayal, and inspired by the French model, the first Bourbon king enacted the [[Nueva Planta decrees]] of 1707, 1715 and 1716, incorporating the realms of the Crown of Aragon, including the Principality of Catalonia in 1716, as provinces of the Crown of Castile, terminating their status as separate states along with their parliaments, institutions and [[Public law|public and administrative laws]], as well as their {{not a typo|pactist}} politics, within a French-style centralized and [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] kingdom of Spain.<ref>Mercader, J. ''Felip V i Catalunya''. (Barcelona, 1968).</ref> In the second half of the 17th century and the 18th century (excluding the parentesis of the Succession War and the post-war inestability) Catalonia carried out a successful process of economic growth and [[proto-industrialization]], reinforced in the late quarter of the century when Castile's trade monopoly with American colonies ended.

=== Late modern history ===
[[File:Cesar Alvarez Dumont - El Gran dia de Girona.jpg|thumb|[[Third siege of Girona]] (1809), [[Peninsular War]] against Napoleon]]

At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Catalonia was severely affected by the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In 1808, it was occupied by French troops under general [[Guillaume Philibert Duhesme]] after he conquered Barcelona; the resistance against the occupation eventually developed into the [[Peninsular War]]. The rejection of French dominion was institutionalized with the creation of "juntas" (councils) who, remaining loyal to the Bourbons, exercised the sovereignty and representation of the territory due to the disappearance of the old institutions. Napoleon took direct control of Catalonia to reestablish order, creating the Government of Catalonia under the rule of [[Marshall Augereau]], and making Catalan briefly an official language again. Between 1812 and 1814, Catalonia was annexed to France and organized as four [[French departments of Spain|departments]].<ref>''{{cite web|url=http://www.histoire-empire.org/departements/france_modifications.htm|title=Les modifications intérieures de la France|access-date=24 January 2019|archive-date=19 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200519002900/http://www.histoire-empire.org/departements/france_modifications.htm|url-status=live}}''</ref> The French troops evacuated Catalan territory at the end of 1814. After the Bourbon restoration in Spain and the death of the absolutist king [[Ferdinand VII]] (1833), [[Carlist Wars]] erupted against the newly established [[Liberalism|liberal state]] of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]]. Catalonia was divided, with the coastal and most industrialized areas supporting liberalism, while most of the countryside were in the hands of the [[Carlism|Carlist faction]]; the latter proposed to reestablish the institutional systems suppressed by the Nueva Planta decrees in the ancient realms of the Crown of Aragon. The consolidation of the liberal state saw a new provincial division of Spain, including Catalonia, which was divided into four provinces (Barcelona, Girona, Lleida and Tarragona).

In the second third of the 19th{{nbsp}}century, Catalonia became an important industrial center, particularly focused on [[History of the cotton industry in Catalonia|textiles]]. This process was a consequence of the conditions of proto-industrialisation of textile production in the prior two centuries, growing capital from wine and brandy export,

and was later boosted by the government support for domestic manufacturing. In 1832, the [[Bonaplata Factory]] in Barcelona became the first factory in the country to make use of the [[steam engine]].

The first railway on the Iberian Peninsula was built between Barcelona and [[Mataró]] in 1848.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} A policy to encourage [[Company town#Industrial colonies in Catalonia|company towns]] also saw the textile industry flourish in the countryside in the 1860s and 1870s. Although the policy of Spanish governments oscillated between free trade and protectionism, {{ill|protectionist laws|es|Ley de Relaciones Comerciales con las Antillas|vertical-align=sup}} become more common. To this day Catalonia remains one of the most industrialised areas of Spain.

In the same period, Barcelona was the focus of industrial conflict and revolutionary uprisings known as "bullangues". In Catalonia, a [[republicanism|republican]] current began to develop among the progressives, attrackting many Catalans who favored the federalisation of Spain. Meanwhile, the Catalan language saw a [[Romanticism|Romantic]] cultural renaissance from the second third of the century onwards, the ''[[Renaixença]]'', among both the working class and the bourgeoisie. Right after the fall of the [[First Spanish Republic]] (1873–1874) and the subsequent restoration of the Bourbon dynasty (1874), Catalan nationalism began to be organized politically under the leadership of the republican federalist [[Valentí Almirall i Llozer|Valentí Almirall]].

The [[anarchist]] movement had been active throughout the last quarter of the 19th century and the early 20th century, founding the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] trade union in 1910 and achieving one of the first [[eight-hour day|eight-hour workdays]] in Europe in 1919.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[The Revolutionary Left in Spain, 1914–1923]]|last=Meaker|first=Gerald H.|date=1974|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RM6rAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA158 159] ff|isbn=0-8047-0845-2}}</ref> Growing resentment of conscription and of the military culminated in the [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Tragic Week]] (Catalan: ''Setmana Tràgica'') in Barcelona in 1909.

In 1914, the four Catalan provinces were authorized to create a [[Commonwealth of Catalonia|commonwealth]] (Catalan: ''Mancomunitat de Catalunya''), lacking any legislative power or specific political autonomy, which carried out an ambitious program of modernization, but it was disbanded in 1925 by the dictatorship of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera]] (1923–1930). During the final stage of the Dictatorship, with Spain beginning to suffer an economic crisis, Barcelona hosted the [[1929 Barcelona International Exposition|1929 International Exposition]].<ref name="MonclúsFraga2006">{{cite book|author1=Monclús, Francisco Javier|author2=Francisco Javier Monclús Fraga|title=Exposiciones internacionales y urbanismo: el proyecto Expo Zaragoza 2008 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2d6KJ2VnfAkC&pg=PA48|year=2006|publisher=Univ.

The left-wing pro-independence leader [[Francesc Macià]] was appointed its first president. Under the Statute, Catalan became an official language.

This period was marked by political unrest, the effects of the economic crisis and their social repercussions. The Statute of Autonomy was suspended in 1934, due to the [[Events of 6 October]] in Barcelona, as a response{{clarify|date=January 2019}} to the accession of right-wing Spanish nationalist party [[CEDA]] to the government of the Republic, considered close to [[fascism]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Finestres|first1=Jordi|last2=López|first2=Manel|title=Entre la revolució i l'estelada|journal=Sàpiens|year=2014|location=Barcelona|language=ca|issn=1695-2014|pages=31–32}}</ref> After the electoral victory of the left wing [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] in February 1936, the Government of Catalonia was pardoned and the self-government was restored.

The defeat of the [[July 1936 military uprising in Barcelona|military rebellion against the Republican government in Barcelona]] placed Catalonia firmly in the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican side]] of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. During the war, there were two rival powers in Catalonia: the de jure power of the Generalitat and the de facto power of the armed popular militias.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Spanish Civil war: Revolution and counter-revolution.|last=Bolloten|first=Burnett|author-link=Burnett Bolloten|year=1991|publisher=[[University of North Carolina Press]]|pages=388–389}}</ref> Violent confrontations between the workers' parties ([[CNT-FAI]] and [[Workers Party of Marxist Unification|POUM]] against the [[Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia|PSUC]]) culminated in the defeat of the first ones in 1937. The situation resolved itself progressively in favor of the Generalitat, but at the same time the Generalitat lost most of its autonomous powers within Republican Spain. In 1938 Franco's troops broke the Republican territory in two, isolating Catalonia from the rest of the Republican territory. The defeat of the Republican army in the [[Battle of the Ebro]] led in 1938 and 1939 to the occupation of Catalonia by Franco's forces.

The defeat of the Spanish Republic in the [[Spanish Civil War]] brought to power the dictatorship of [[Francisco Franco]], whose first ten-year rule was particularly violent, autocratic, and repressive both in a political, cultural, social, and economical sense.<ref>[[Stanley G. Payne|Payne, Stanley]] (1999). ''Fascism in Spain, 1923–1977'', pp. 476–477. Univ. of Wisconsin Press.</ref> In Catalonia, any kind of public activities associated with [[Catalan nationalism]], [[republicanism]], [[anarchism]], [[socialism]], [[liberalism]], [[democracy]] or [[communism]], including the publication of books on those subjects or simply discussion of them in open meetings, was banned. [[File:FrancoenReus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Francisco Franco]] in [[Reus]], 1940]] Franco's regime banned the use of Catalan in government-run institutions and during public events, and the Catalan institutions of self-government were abolished. The pro-Republic of Spain president of Catalonia, [[Lluís Companys]], was taken to Spain from his exile in the German-occupied France and was tortured and executed in the [[Montjuïc Castle (Barcelona)|Montjuïc Castle]] of Barcelona for the crime of 'military rebellion'.<ref>[[Paul Preston|Preston, Paul]]. (2012). ''The Spanish Holocaust''. Harper Press. London p. 493.</ref>

During later stages of [[Francoist Spain]], certain folkloric and religious celebrations in Catalan resumed and were tolerated. Use of Catalan in the [[mass media]] had been forbidden but was permitted from the early 1950s<ref>{{cite book|author=Ross|title=Cultural Contestation in Ethnic Conflict|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oe4popSDfW0C&pg=PA139|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-46307-2|page=139|date=3 May 2007|access-date=9 November 2020|archive-date=11 March 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220311112038/https://books.google.com/books?id=Oe4popSDfW0C&pg=PA139|url-status=live}}</ref> in the theatre.

The years after the war were extremely hard. Catalonia, like many other parts of Spain, had been devastated by the war. Recovery from the war damage was slow and made more difficult by the international trade embargo and the [[Autarky|autarkic]] politics of Franco's regime. By the late 1950s, the region had recovered its pre-war economic levels and in the 1960s was the second-fastest growing economy in the world in what became known as the [[Spanish miracle]].

After Franco's death in 1975, Catalonia voted for the adoption of a democratic Spanish Constitution in 1978, in which Catalonia recovered political and cultural autonomy, restoring the Generalitat (exiled since the end of the Civil War in 1939) in 1977 and adopting a [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1979|new Statute of Autonomy]] in 1979, which defined Catalonia as a "nationality". The [[1980 Catalan regional election|first elections]] to the Parliament of Catalonia under this Statute gave the Catalan presidency to [[Jordi Pujol]], leader of [[Convergence and Unity|Convergència i Unió]] (CiU), a center-right Catalan nationalist electoral coalition, with Pujol re-elected until 2003.

==== Independence movement ====
{{Main|Catalan independence movement|2017–18 Spanish constitutional crisis}}
In November 2003, elections to the Parliament of Catalonia gave the government to a left-wing Catalanist coalition formed by the [[Socialists' Party of Catalonia]] (PSC-PSOE), [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] (ERC) and [[Initiative for Catalonia Greens]] (ICV), and the socialist [[Pasqual Maragall]] was appointed president. The new government redacted a [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia|new version of the Statute of Autonomy]], with the aim of consolidate and expand certain aspects of self-government.

The new Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, approved after a referendum in 2006, was contested by important sectors of the Spanish society, especially by the conservative [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]], which sent the law to the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]]. In 2010, the Court declared non-valid some of the articles that established an autonomous Catalan system of Justice, improved aspects of the financing, a new territorial division, the status of Catalan language or the symbolical declaration of Catalonia as a nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/3748884/20100629/sentencia-lestatut-obre-nova-era-politica-catalunya.html|title=Anàlisi de les retallades a l'estatut de Catalunya|last=associats|first=Partal, Maresma i|access-date=13 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913152842/http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/3748884/20100629/sentencia-lestatut-obre-nova-era-politica-catalunya.html|archive-date=13 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> This decision was severely contested by large sectors of Catalan society, which increased the demands of independence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ara.cat/especials/gentada-centre-Barcelona-mitja-manifestacio_0_772122901.html|title=Un milió i mig de manifestants per la independència de Catalunya|access-date=13 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918025513/http://www.ara.cat/especials/gentada-centre-Barcelona-mitja-manifestacio_0_772122901.html|archive-date=18 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The climate of Catalonia is diverse. The populated areas lying by the coast in Tarragona, Barcelona and Girona provinces feature a [[Hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csa''). The inland part (including the Lleida province and the inner part of Barcelona province) show a mostly [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csa''). The Pyrenean peaks have a [[continental climate|continental]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''D'') or even [[Alpine climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''ET'') at the highest summits, while the valleys have a maritime or [[oceanic climate]] sub-type ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb'').

In the Mediterranean area, summers are dry and hot with sea breezes, and the maximum temperature is around {{convert|26|-|31|°C}}. Winter is cool or slightly cold depending on the location. It snows frequently in the Pyrenees, and it occasionally snows at lower altitudes, even by the coastline. Spring and autumn are typically the rainiest seasons, except for the Pyrenean valleys, where summer is typically stormy.

The inland part of Catalonia is hotter and drier in summer. Temperature may reach {{convert|35|°C}}, some days even {{convert|40|°C}}. Nights are cooler there than at the coast, with the temperature of around {{convert|14|-|17|°C}}. Fog is not uncommon in valleys and plains; it can be especially persistent, with [[freezing drizzle]] episodes and subzero temperatures during winter, mainly along the [[Ebro]] and [[Segre River|Segre]] valleys and in [[Plain of Vic]].

Catalonia has a marked geographical diversity, considering the relatively small size of its territory. The [[geography]] is conditioned by the Mediterranean coast, with {{convert|580|km|mi|abbr=off}} of coastline, and the towering Pyrenees along the long northern border. Catalonia is divided into three main geomorphological units:<ref>{{cite web|title=Geological map of Catalonia|url=http://www.icgc.cat/en/Public-Administration-and-Enterprises/Downloads/Geological-and-geothematic-cartography/Geological-mapping/Geological-map-of-Catalonia-1-50.000|publisher=Institut Cartogràfic i Geològic de Catalunya|access-date=11 October 2017|date=2016|archive-date=12 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012044144/http://www.icgc.cat/en/Public-Administration-and-Enterprises/Downloads/Geological-and-geothematic-cartography/Geological-mapping/Geological-map-of-Catalonia-1-50.000|url-status=live}}</ref>

*The Pyrenees: mountainous formation that connects the Iberian Peninsula with the [[Continental Europe|European continental territory]] (see passage above);
*The Catalan Coastal mountain ranges or the Catalan Mediterranean System: an alternating delevacions and planes parallel to the Mediterranean coast;
*The [[Catalan Central Depression]]: structural unit which forms the eastern sector of the Valley of the Ebro.

[[File:2012 Montserrat.jpg|thumb|left|Mountain of [[Montserrat (mountain)|Montserrat]] and the [[Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey|monastery]]]]
The Catalan Pyrenees represent almost half in length of the Pyrenees, as it extends more than {{convert|200|km|abbr=off}}. Traditionally differentiated the Axial Pyrenees (the main part) and the [[Pre-Pyrenees]] (southern from the Axial) which are mountainous formations parallel to the main mountain ranges but with lower altitudes, less steep and a different geological formation. The highest mountain of Catalonia, located north of the comarca of Pallars Sobirà is the Pica d'Estats (3,143{{spaces}}m), followed by the Puigpedrós (2,914{{spaces}}m). The [[Serra del Cadí]] comprises the highest peaks in the Pre-Pyrenees and forms the southern boundary of the [[Cerdanya]] valley.

The Central Catalan Depression is a plain located between the Pyrenees and Pre-Coastal Mountains. Elevation ranges from {{convert|200|to|600|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The plains and the water that descend from the Pyrenees have made it fertile territory for [[agriculture]] and numerous irrigation canals have been built. Another major plain is the [[Empordà]], located in the northeast.

The Catalan Mediterranean system is based on two ranges running roughly parallel to the coast (southwest–northeast), called the Coastal and the Pre-Coastal Ranges. The Coastal Range is both the shorter and the lower of the two, while the Pre-Coastal is greater in both length and elevation. Areas within the Pre-Coastal Range include [[Montserrat (mountain)|Montserrat]], [[Montseny Massif|Montseny]] and the [[Ports de Tortosa-Beseit]]. Lowlands alternate with the Coastal and Pre-Coastal Ranges. The Coastal Lowland is located to the East of the Coastal Range between it and the coast, while the Pre-Coastal Lowlands are located inland, between the Coastal and Pre-Coastal Ranges, and includes the [[Vallès]] and [[Penedès]] plains.

=== Flora and fauna ===
[[File:BennyTrapp Montseny-Gebirgsmolch Calotriton arnoldi Montseny-Gebirge Spanien.jpg|thumb|Montseny brook newt (''[[Calotriton arnoldi]]''), [[endemic]] to the [[Montseny Massif]]]]
Catalonia is a showcase of European [[landscapes]] on a small scale. Just over {{convert|30000|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}} hosting a variety of substrates, soils, climates, directions, altitudes and distances to the sea. The area is of great ecological diversity and a remarkable wealth of landscapes, habitats and species.

The fauna of Catalonia comprises a minority of animals endemic to the region and a majority of non-endemic animals. Much of Catalonia enjoys a Mediterranean climate (except mountain areas), which makes many of the animals that live there adapted to Mediterranean ecosystems. Of mammals, there are plentiful [[wild boar]], red foxes, as well as [[roe deer]] and in the Pyrenees, the [[Pyrenean chamois]]. Other large species such as the [[bear]] have been recently reintroduced.

The waters of the [[Balearic Sea]] are rich in biodiversity, and even the [[megafauna]]s of the oceans; various types of whales (such as [[fin whale|fin]], [[sperm whale|sperm]], and [[long-finned pilot whale|pilot]]) and [[dolphin]]s can be found in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmaktub.org/en/home-2/|title=EDMAKTUB I Estudio de cetáceos|website=www.edmaktub.org|access-date=22 March 2017|archive-date=25 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325202832/http://www.edmaktub.org/en/home-2/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Casinos, A.; Vericad, R.

=== Hydrography ===
{{See also|List of rivers of Catalonia}}
[[File:Aerea estany de banyoles.png|thumb|[[Lake of Banyoles]] ]]
[[File:Tossa de Mar Buchten 1.JPG|thumb|[[Tossa de Mar]], Costa Brava]]
Most of Catalonia belongs to the [[Mediterranean Basin]]. The Catalan hydrographic network consists of two important basins, the one of the [[Ebro]] and the one that comprises the internal basins of Catalonia (respectively covering 46.84% and 51.43% of the territory), all of them flow to the [[Mediterranean]]. Furthermore, there is the [[Garona]] river basin that flows to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], but it only covers 1.73% of the Catalan territory.

The hydrographic network can be divided in two sectors, an occidental slope or Ebro river slope and one oriental slope constituted by minor rivers that flow to the Mediterranean along the Catalan coast. The first slope provides an average of {{convert|18700|hm3|cumi|lk=on|abbr=off}} per year, while the second only provides an average of {{convert|2020|hm3|cumi|abbr=on}}/year. The difference is due to the big contribution of the Ebro river, from which the [[Segre (river)|Segre]] is an important tributary. Moreover, in Catalonia there is a relative wealth of groundwaters, although there is inequality between ''[[comarca|comarques]]'', given the complex geological structure of the territory.<ref name="GEC clima">{{cite web|url=http://www.enciclopedia.cat/enciclop%C3%A8dies/gran-enciclop%C3%A8dia-catalana/EC-GEC-0016439.xml|title=Catalunya: El clima i la hidrografia|language=ca|work=l'Enciclopèdia|location=Barcelona|editor=Gran Enciclopedia Catalana}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref> In the Pyrenees there are many small lakes, remnants of the [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]]. The biggest are the [[lake of Banyoles]] and the recently recovered [[lake of Ivars]].

The Catalan coast is almost rectilinear, with a length of {{convert|580|km}} and few [[landform]]s—the most relevant are the [[Cap de Creus]] and the [[Gulf of Roses]] to the north and the [[Ebro Delta]] to the south. The [[Catalan Coastal Range]] hugs the coastline, and it is split into two segments, one between [[L'Estartit]] and the town of [[Blanes]] (the [[Costa Brava]]), and the other at the south, at the Costes del [[Garraf]].

The principal [[List of rivers of Catalonia|rivers in Catalonia]] are the [[Ter (river)|Ter]], [[Llobregat]], and the [[Ebro]] (Catalan: {{lang|ca|Ebre}}), all of which run into the [[Mediterranean]].

=== Anthropic pressure and protection of nature ===
The majority of Catalan population is concentrated in 30% of the territory, mainly in the coastal plains. Intensive agriculture, livestock farming and industrial activities have been accompanied by a massive [[Mass tourism|tourist]] influx (more than 20{{spaces}}million annual visitors), a rate of urbanization and even of major metropolisation which has led to a strong urban sprawl: two thirds of Catalans live in the urban area of Barcelona, while the proportion of urban land increased from 4.2% in 1993 to 6.2% in 2009, a growth of 48.6% in sixteen years, complemented with a dense network of transport infrastructure. This is accompanied by a certain agricultural abandonment (decrease of 15% of all areas cultivated in Catalonia between 1993 and 2009) and a global threat to [[natural environment]]. Human activities have also put some animal species at risk, or even led to their disappearance from the territory, like the [[gray wolf]] and probably the [[brown bear]] of the Pyrenees. The pressure created by this model of life means that the country's [[ecological footprint]] exceeds its administrative area.<ref>{{in lang|ca}} [http://www.gencat.cat/mediamb/publicacions/monografies/bd_conservacio/bd_catalunya_ca_basic.pdf ''Biodiversitat a Catalunya'', Generalitat de Catalunya] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924082817/http://www.gencat.cat/mediamb/publicacions/monografies/bd_conservacio/bd_catalunya_ca_basic.pdf|date=24 September 2015}} Retrieved 29 July 2017.</ref>

Faced with these problems, Catalan authorities initiated several measures whose purpose is to protect natural ecosystems. Thus, in 1990, the Catalan government created the Nature Conservation Council (Catalan: {{lang|ca|Consell de Protecció de la Natura}}), an advisory body with the aim to study, protect and manage the natural environments and landscapes of Catalonia. In addition, the Generalitat has carried out the Plan of Spaces of Natural Interest ({{lang|ca|Pla d'Espais d'Interès Natural}} or PEIN) in 1992 while eighteen Natural Spaces of Special Protection ({{lang|ca|Espais Naturals de Protecció Especial}} or ENPE) have been instituted.

There's a [[National Park]], [[Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici National Park|Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici]]; fourteen [[Natural park (Spain)|Natural Parks]], [[Alt Pirineu Natural Park|Alt Pirineu]], Aiguamolls de l'Empordà, [[Cadí-Moixeró Natural Park|Cadí-Moixeró]], [[Cap de Creus]], Sources of Ter and Freser, [[Collserola]], [[Ebro Delta]], [[Ports de Tortosa-Beseit|Ports]], [[Montgrí, Medes Islands and Baix Ter Natural Park|Montgrí, Medes Islands and Baix Ter]], [[Montseny Massif|Montseny]], [[Montserrat]], Sant Llorenç del Munt and l'Obac, [[Serra de Montsant]], and the [[Zona Volcànica de la Garrotxa Natural Park|Garrotxa Volcanic Zone]]; as well as three Natural Places of National Interest ({{lang|ca|Paratge Natural d'Interes Nacional}} or PNIN), the [[Pedraforca]], the [[Poblet Monastery|Poblet]] Forest and the [[Albères]].

Two major factors were [[Constitutional Court of Spain|Spain's Constitutional Court's]] 2010 decision to declare part of the 2006 Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia unconstitutional, as well as the fact that Catalonia contributes 19.49% of the central government's tax revenue, but only receives 14.03% of central government's spending.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Abend|first=Lisa|title=Spain Barcelona Warns Madrid: Pay Up, or Catalonia Leaves Spain|url=http://world.time.com/2012/09/11/barcelona-warns-madrid-pay-up-or-catalonia-leaves-spain/?xid=newsletter-weekly|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=17 September 2012|date=11 September 2012|archive-date=20 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920215317/http://world.time.com/2012/09/11/barcelona-warns-madrid-pay-up-or-catalonia-leaves-spain/?xid=newsletter-weekly|url-status=live}}</ref>

Parties that consider themselves either Catalan nationalist or [[Catalan independence|independentist]] have been present in all Catalan governments since 1980. The largest Catalan nationalist party, [[Convergence and Union]], ruled Catalonia from 1980 to 2003, and returned to power in the [[2010 Catalan regional election|2010 election]]. Between 2003 and 2010, a leftist coalition, composed by the [[Partit dels Socialistes de Catalunya|Catalan Socialists' Party]], the pro-independence [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] and the leftist-environmentalist [[Iniciativa per Catalunya Verds|Initiative for Catalonia-Greens]], implemented policies that widened Catalan autonomy.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

In the [[2012 Catalonian parliamentary election|25 November 2012 Catalan parliamentary election]], sovereigntist parties supporting a secession referendum gathered 59.01% of the votes and held 87 of the 135{{nbsp}}seats in the Catalan Parliament. Parties supporting independence from the rest of Spain obtained 49.12% of the votes and a majority of 74{{nbsp}}seats.

[[Artur Mas]], then the president of Catalonia, organised early elections that took place on 27{{nbsp}}September{{nbsp}}2015. In these elections, Convergència and Esquerra Republicana decided to join, and they presented themselves under the coalition named [[Junts pel Sí]] (in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], Together for Yes).

[[File:Estatuto de Nuria.jpg|thumb|upright|The first [[Statute of Catalonia]], 1932]]
The [[Statute of Autonomy]] of Catalonia is the fundamental organic law, second only to the Spanish Constitution from which the Statute originates.

In the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] Catalonia, along with the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], was defined as a "[[nationalities and regions of Spain|nationality]]".{{dubious|date=November 2021}} The same constitution gave Catalonia the automatic right to autonomy, which resulted in the [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1979]].{{explain|date=November 2021}}

Both the 1979 Statute of Autonomy and the current one, approved in 2006, state that "Catalonia, as a nationality, exercises its self-government constituted as an Autonomous Community in accordance with the Constitution and with the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, which is its basic institutional law, always under the law in Spain".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gencat.net/generalitat/eng/estatut/titol_preliminar.htm#a1|title=First article of the Statute of Autonomy of Catalunya|publisher=Gencat.net|access-date=25 April 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113100832/http://www.gencat.net/generalitat/eng/estatut/titol_preliminar.htm#a1|archive-date=13 January 2009}}</ref>

The Preamble of the 2006 Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia states that the [[Parliament of Catalonia]] has defined Catalonia as a [[nation]], but that "the Spanish Constitution recognizes Catalonia's national reality as a nationality".<ref>[http://www.constitucion.es/constitucion/castellano/titulo_preliminar.html Constitución Española, Titulo Preliminar]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013022212/http://www.constitucion.es/constitucion/castellano/titulo_preliminar.html|date=13 October 2007}}</ref> While the Statute was approved by and sanctioned by both the Catalan and Spanish parliaments, and later by referendum in Catalonia, it has been subject to a legal challenge by the surrounding autonomous communities of [[Aragon]], [[Balearic Islands]] and [[Valencian Community|Valencia]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Europa Press/Madrid|url=http://www.hoy.es/prensa/20061115/nacional/admitidos-recursos-aragon-valencia_20061115.html|title=Admitidos los recursos de Aragón, Valencia y Baleares contra el Estatuto catalán.|publisher=Hoy.es|date=1 December 1997|access-date=25 April 2010|archive-date=4 August 2012|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120804013947/http://www.hoy.es/prensa/20061115/nacional/admitidos-recursos-aragon-valencia_20061115.html|url-status=bot: unknown}}</ref> as well as by the conservative [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]]. The objections are based on various issues such as disputed [[cultural heritage]] but, especially, on the Statute's alleged breaches of the principle of "solidarity between regions" in fiscal and educational matters enshrined by the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Constitution]].<ref>{{cite news|author=El País|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/anos/encarnizada/batalla/politica/elpepuesp/20100416elpepunac_26/Tes|title=Cuatro años de encarnizada batalla política.|newspaper=El País|date=29 June 2010|access-date=29 June 2010|archive-date=3 July 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220703023004/https://elpais.com/elpais/2010/04/16/actualidad/1271405842_850215.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Spain's [[Constitutional Court of Spain|Constitutional Court]] assessed the disputed articles and on 28 June 2010, issued its judgment on the principal allegation of unconstitutionality presented by the People's Party in 2006. The judgment granted clear passage to 182 articles of the 223 that make up the fundamental text. The court approved 73 of the 114 articles that the People's Party had contested, while declaring 14 articles unconstitutional in whole or in part and imposing a restrictive interpretation on 27 others.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/retoque/74/articulos/recurridos/elpepunac/20100629elpepinac_4/Tes|title=Ni un retoque en 74 artículos recurridos|newspaper=El País|access-date=29 June 2010|archive-date=3 July 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220703023004/https://elpais.com/diario/2010/06/29/espana/1277762404_850215.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The court accepted the specific provision that described Catalonia as a "nation", however ruled that it was a historical and cultural term with no legal weight, and that Spain remained the only nation recognised by the constitution.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/news/Catalonia-39is-not-a-nation39.6412380.jp|title=Catalonia 'is not a nation' 10 July 2010 |publisher=News.scotsman.com|date=10 July 2010|access-date=6 January 2011|location=Edinburgh|archive-date=29 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629141155/http://news.scotsman.com/news/Catalonia-39is-not-a-nation39.6412380.jp|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.matthewbennett.es/60/is-catalonia-a-nation-or-a-nationality-or-is-spain-the-only-nation-in-spain/|title=Is Catalonia a nation or a nationality, or is Spain the only nation in Spain?|publisher=Matthewbennett.es|access-date=6 January 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908023751/http://www.matthewbennett.es/60/is-catalonia-a-nation-or-a-nationality-or-is-spain-the-only-nation-in-spain/|archive-date=8 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Fiona Govan|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/7861118/Catalonia-can-call-itself-a-nation-rules-Spains-top-court.html|archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220110/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/7861118/Catalonia-can-call-itself-a-nation-rules-Spains-top-court.html|archive-date=10 January 2022|url-access=subscription|url-status=live|title=Catalonia can call itself a 'nation', rules Spain's top court 29 Jun 2010 |work=Telegraph|date=29 June 2010|access-date=6 January 2011|location=London}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16490065|title=A nationality, not a nation Jul 1st 2010 |newspaper=The Economist|date=1 July 2010|access-date=6 January 2011|archive-date=25 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180225082016/http://www.economist.com/node/16490065|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Parliament of Catalonia]] (Catalan: {{lang|ca|Parlament de Catalunya}}) is the unicameral legislative body of the Generalitat and represents the people of Catalonia. Its 135{{nbsp}}members (''diputats'') are elected by [[universal suffrage]] to serve for a four-year period. According to the Statute of Autonomy, it has powers to legislate over devolved matters such as education, health, culture, internal institutional and territorial organization, nomination of the President of the Generalitat and control the Government, budget and other affairs. The last Catalan election [[2024 Catalan regional election|was held on 12 May 2024]], and its current speaker (president) is [[Josep Rull]], incumbent since 10{{nbsp}}June{{nbsp}}2024.

The [[President of the Generalitat of Catalonia]] (Catalan: {{lang|ca|president de la Generalitat de Catalunya}}) is the highest representative of Catalonia, and is also responsible of leading the government's action, presiding the Executive Council. Since the restoration of the Generalitat on the return of democracy in Spain, the [[List of Presidents of the Generalitat de Catalunya|Presidents of Catalonia]] have been [[Josep Tarradellas]] (1977–1980, president in exile since 1954), [[Jordi Pujol]] (1980–2003), [[Pasqual Maragall]] (2003–2006), [[José Montilla]] (2006–2010), [[Artur Mas]] (2010–2016), [[Carles Puigdemont]] (2016–2017) and, after the imposition of direct rule from Madrid, [[Quim Torra]] (2018–2020), [[Pere Aragonès]] (2021–2024) and Salvador Illa (2024–).

The [[Executive Council of Catalonia|Executive Council]] (Catalan: {{lang|ca|Consell Executiu}}) or Government ({{lang|ca|Govern}}), is the body responsible of the government of the Generalitat, it holds executive and regulatory power, being accountable to the Catalan Parliament. It comprises the President of the Generalitat, the [[List of First Ministers of Catalonia|First Minister]] ({{lang|ca|conseller primer}}) or the [[List of Vice Presidents of Catalonia|Vice President]], and the ministers ({{lang|ca|consellers}}) appointed by the president. Its seat is the [[Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya|Palau de la Generalitat]], Barcelona. In 2021 the government was a coalition of two parties, the [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] (ERC) and [[Together for Catalonia (2020)|Together for Catalonia]] (Junts) and is made up of 14 ministers, including the vice President, alongside to the president and a secretary of government, but in October{{nbsp}}2022 Together for Catalonia (Junts) left the coalition and the government.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Catalan government broken: Junts leaves coalition cabinet, Esquerra stays alone|url=https://english.vilaweb.cat/noticies/catalan-government-broken-junts-leaves-coalition-cabinet-esquerra-stays-alone/|access-date=2022-10-28|website=VilaWeb|language=ca|archive-date=28 October 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221028034515/https://english.vilaweb.cat/noticies/catalan-government-broken-junts-leaves-coalition-cabinet-esquerra-stays-alone/|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Security forces and Justice ===
{{Main|Mossos d'Esquadra}}
Catalonia has its own police force, the {{lang|ca|[[Mossos d'Esquadra]]}} (officially called {{lang|ca|Mossos d'Esquadra-Policia de la Generalitat de Catalunya}}), whose origins date back to the 18th{{nbsp}}century. Since 1980 they have been under the command of the Generalitat, and since 1994 they have expanded in number in order to replace the national [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] and [[National Police Corps]], which report directly to the Homeland Department of Spain. The national bodies retain personnel within Catalonia to exercise functions of national scope such as overseeing ports, airports, coasts, international borders, custom offices, the identification of documents and arms control, immigration control, terrorism prevention, arms trafficking prevention, amongst others.

Most of the justice system is administered by national judicial institutions, the highest body and last judicial instance in the Catalan jurisdiction, integrating the Spanish judiciary, is the [[High Court of Justice of Catalonia]]. The [[criminal justice]] system is uniform throughout Spain, while [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] is administered separately within Catalonia. The civil laws that are subject to autonomous legislation have been codified in the [[Civil Code of Catalonia]] ({{lang|ca|Codi civil de Catalunya}}) since 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://civil.udg.es/normacivil/catalunya.htm|title=Legislació civil catalana|publisher=Civil.udg.es|date=20 July 2006|access-date=25 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706215412/http://civil.udg.es/normacivil/catalunya.htm|archive-date=6 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Catalonia, together with [[Navarre]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], are the Spanish communities with the highest degree of autonomy in terms of [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement]].

=== Administrative divisions ===
[[File:CatMCVPtoponims.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Provinces, regions and counties of Catalonia (until 2015)]]{{Main|Subdivisions of Catalonia}}
{{See also|Political divisions of Spain|Local government in Spain}}
Catalonia is organised territorially into [[Provinces of Spain|provinces]] or [[Vegueries of Catalonia|regions]], further subdivided into [[comarca|comarques]] and [[municipality|municipalities]]. The [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 2006|2006{{nbsp}}Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia]] establishes the administrative organisation of the later three.

==== Provinces ====
{{Further|Provinces of Spain}}
Much like the rest of Spain, Catalonia is divided administratively into four provinces, the governing body of which is the [[Provincial deputation (Spain)|Provincial Deputation]] ({{langx|ca|Diputació Provincial|links=no}}, {{langx|oc|Deputacion Provinciau|links=no}}, {{langx|es|Diputación Provincial|links=no}}). As of 2010, the four provinces and their populations were:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idescat.cat/territ/BasicTerr?TC=5&V0=5&V1=08&V3=863&V4=435&ALLINFO=TRUE&PARENT=1&GERMANS=TRUE&CTX=B|title=Padró municipal d'habitants.

*[[Province of Lleida]]: 437,939 population
*[[Province of Tarragona]]: 830,804 population
Unlike vegueries, provinces do not follow the limitations of the subdivisional counties, notably [[Cerdanya (comarca)|Baixa Cerdanya]], which is split in half between the demarcations of Lleida and Girona. This situation has led some isolated municipalities to request province changes from the Spanish government.<ref>{{Cite web|last=324cat|date=2023-11-28|title=El cas singular de Gósol, que vol deixar de dependre de quatre administracions: "Cal un debat"|url=https://www.ccma.cat/324/el-cas-singular-de-gosol-que-vol-deixar-de-dependre-de-quatre-administracions-cal-un-debat/noticia/3263567/|access-date=2024-02-04|website=CCMA|language=ca|archive-date=4 February 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240204193735/https://www.ccma.cat/324/el-cas-singular-de-gosol-que-vol-deixar-de-dependre-de-quatre-administracions-cal-un-debat/noticia/3263567/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Vegueries ====
{{Main|Vegueries of Catalonia}}

Besides provinces, Catalonia is internally divided into eight regions or vegueries, based on the feudal administrative territorial jurisdiction of the [[Principality of Catalonia]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=vegueria {{!}} enciclopedia.cat|url=https://www.enciclopedia.cat/gran-enciclopedia-catalana/vegueria-1|access-date=2024-02-04|website=www.enciclopedia.cat|archive-date=30 June 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230630102826/https://www.enciclopedia.cat/gran-enciclopedia-catalana/vegueria-1|url-status=live}}</ref> Established in 2006, vegueries are used by the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] with the aim to more effectively divide Catalonia administratively.

The current regional division has its roots in a decree of the Generalitat de Catalunya of 1936, in effect until 1939, when it was suppressed by Franco. In 1987 the Catalan Government reestablished the comarcal division and in 1988 three new comarques were added ([[Alta Ribagorça]], [[Pla d'Urgell]] and [[Pla de l'Estany]]). Some further revisions have been realised since then, such as the additions of [[Moianès]] and [[Lluçanès]] counties, in 2015 and 2023 respectively. Except for [[Barcelonès]], every comarca is administered by a [[comarcal council]] ({{lang|ca|consell comarcal}}).

As of 2024, Catalonia is divided in 42 counties plus the [[Val d'Aran|Aran Valley]]. The latter, although previously (and still informally) considered a comarca, obtained in 1990 a particular status within Catalonia due to its differences in culture and language, being administered by a body known as the {{lang|oc|[[Conselh Generau d'Aran]]}} (General Council of Aran), and in 2015 it was defined as a "unique territorial entity" instead of a county.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/CCAA/ca-l16-1990.html#|title=Ley 16/1990, de 13 de julio, sobre el régimen especial del Valle de Arán. |publisher=Noticias Jurídicas|access-date=20 July 2010|archive-date=8 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608204441/http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/CCAA/ca-l16-1990.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Municipalities ====
{{Further|Municipalities of Catalonia}}
There are at present 947{{nbsp}}municipalities ({{lang|ca|municipis}}) in Catalonia. Each municipality is run by a council ({{lang|ca|ajuntament}}) elected every four years by the residents in local elections. The council consists of a number of members ({{lang|ca|regidors}}) depending on population, who elect the [[mayor]] ({{lang|ca|alcalde}} or {{lang|ca|batlle}}). Its seat is the [[town hall]] ({{lang|ca|ajuntament}}, {{lang|ca|casa de la ciutat}} or {{lang|ca|casa de la vila}}).

The main tourist destinations in Catalonia are the city of Barcelona, the beaches of the Costa Brava in [[Girona]], the beaches of the [[Costa del Maresme]] and [[Costa del Garraf]] from [[Malgrat de Mar]] to [[Vilanova i la Geltrú]] and the [[Costa Daurada]] in Tarragona. In the High Pyrenees there are several ski resorts, near [[Lleida]].

Many of Spain's leading [[savings bank]]s were based in Catalonia before the [[2017 Catalan independence referendum|independence referendum of 2017]]. However, in the aftermath of the referendum, many of them moved their registered office to other parts of Spain.

==== Airports ====
[[File:17-12-04-Aeropuerto de Barcelona-El Prat-RalfR-DSCF0722.jpg|thumb|right|[[Barcelona El Prat Airport|Barcelona Airport]] tower]]
{{See also|List of airports in Catalonia}}
Airports in Catalonia are owned and operated by [[Aena]] (a [[Government of Spain|Spanish Government]] entity) except two airports in Lleida which are operated by [[Aeroports de Catalunya]] (an entity belonging to the [[Government of Catalonia]]).

*[[Barcelona El Prat Airport]] (Aena)
*[[Girona-Costa Brava Airport]] (Aena)
*[[Reus Airport]] (Aena)
*[[Lleida-Alguaire Airport]] (Aeroports de Catalunya)
*[[Sabadell Airport]] (Aena)
*[[La Seu d'Urgell Airport]] (Aeroports de Catalunya)

==== Ports ====
{{See also|List of ports in Spain}}
[[File:Aerial view of Zona Franca and the Port of Barcelona, Spain (51227005889).jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Zona Franca and the Port of Barcelona]]
Since the Middle Ages, Catalonia has been well integrated into international maritime networks. The [[port of Barcelona]] (owned and operated by {{lang|es|[[Puertos del Estado]]}}, a Spanish Government entity) is an industrial, commercial and tourist port of worldwide importance. With 1,950,000{{nbsp}}[[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEUs]] in 2015, it is the first container port in Catalonia, the third in Spain after Valencia and [[Algeciras]] in Andalusia, the 9th{{nbsp}}in the Mediterranean Sea, the 14th{{nbsp}}in Europe and the 68th{{nbsp}}in the world. It is sixth largest cruise port in the world, the first in Europe and the Mediterranean with 2,364,292{{nbsp}}passengers in 2014. The ports of [[Tarragona]] (owned and operated by Puertos del Estado) in the southwest and [[Palamós]] near Girona at northeast are much more modest. The port of Palamós and the other ports in Catalonia{{nbsp}}(26) are operated and administered by {{lang|ca|{{ill|Ports de la Generalitat|ca|vertical-align=sup}}}}, a Catalan Government entity.

The development of these infrastructures, resulting from the topography and history of the Catalan territory, responds strongly to the administrative and political organization of this autonomous community.

==== Roads ====
{{See also|List of primary highways in Catalonia}}
[[File:Autopista C-16.jpg|thumb|right|[[Autovía C-16|Autovia C-16]] ({{lang|ca|Eix del Llobregat}})]]

There are {{convert|12000|km}} of roads throughout Catalonia.

The principal highways are <span style="background: #009; color: white">'''{{spaces}}AP-7{{spaces}}'''</span> ({{lang|ca|Autopista de la Mediterrània}}) and <span style="background: #009; color: white">'''{{spaces}}A-7{{spaces}}'''</span> ({{lang|ca|Autovia de la Mediterrània}}). They follow the coast from the [[France|French border]] to [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] and [[Andalusia]]. The main roads generally radiate from Barcelona. The <span style="background: #009; color: white">'''{{spaces}}AP-2{{spaces}}'''</span> [[File:Spain traffic signal r200.svg|16px]] ({{lang|ca|Autopista del Nord-est}}) and <span style="background: #009; color: white">'''{{spaces}}A-2{{spaces}}'''</span> ({{lang|ca|Autovia del Nord-est}}) connect inland and onward to Madrid.

Public-own roads in Catalonia are either managed by the autonomous government of Catalonia (e.g., <span style="background: red; color: white">'''{{spaces}}C-{{spaces}}'''</span> roads) or the [[Spanish government]] (e.g., <span style="background: #009; color: white">'''{{spaces}}AP-{{spaces}}'''</span>, <span style="background: #009; color: white">'''{{spaces}}A-{{spaces}}'''</span>, <span style="background: red; color: white">'''{{spaces}}N-{{spaces}}'''</span> roads).

==== Railways ====
{{See also|Rail transport in Catalonia}}
[[File:RN103007TarJPVL.JPG|thumb|right|[[AVE|High-speed train (AVE)]] at [[Camp de Tarragona]] ]]
Catalonia saw the first railway construction in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in 1848, linking Barcelona with [[Mataró]]. Given the topography, most lines radiate from Barcelona. The city has both suburban and inter-city services. The main east coast line runs through the province connecting with the [[SNCF]] (French Railways) at [[Portbou]] on the coast.

There are two publicly owned railway companies operating in Catalonia: the Catalan [[Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya|FGC]] that operates commuter and regional services, and the Spanish national [[Renfe]] that operates long-distance and high-speed rail services (AVE and Avant) and the main commuter and regional service {{lang|ca|[[Rodalies de Catalunya]]}}, administered by the Catalan government since 2010.

[[High-speed rail]] ([[AVE]]) services from [[Madrid]] currently reach Barcelona, via Lleida and Tarragona. The official opening between Barcelona and Madrid took place 20{{nbsp}}February{{nbsp}}2008. The journey between Barcelona and Madrid now takes about two-and-a-half hours. A connection to the [[High-speed rail in France#Network|French high-speed TGV network]] has been completed (called the [[Perpignan–Barcelona high-speed rail line]]) and the Spanish AVE service began commercial services on the line 9{{nbsp}}January{{nbsp}}2013, later offering services to [[Marseille]] on their high speed network.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/europe/spain-opens-iberias-high-speed-rail-link-to-europe.html|title=Spain completes Iberia's high-speed link to Europe|last=Barrow|first=Keith|access-date=24 July 2018|language=en-gb|archive-date=24 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924085255/http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/europe/spain-opens-iberias-high-speed-rail-link-to-europe.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/high-speed/single-view/view/high-speed-launched-between-france-and-spain.html|title=High speed services between France and Spain launched|last=Ltd|first=DVV Media International|work=[[Railway Gazette International]]|access-date=25 July 2018|language=en|archive-date=31 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331214433/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/high-speed/single-view/view/high-speed-launched-between-france-and-spain.html|url-status=live}}</ref> This was shortly followed by the commencement of commercial service by the French TGV on 17{{nbsp}}January{{nbsp}}2013, leading to an average travel time on the [[List of TGV services#International|Paris-Barcelona TGV]] route of 7h{{nbsp}}42m.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetrainline.com/en/train-times/barcelona-to-paris|title=Barcelona to Paris from €35 in 6h29m {{!}} Times, Tickets & Info|website=[[Trainline]]|language=en|access-date=25 July 2018|archive-date=25 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725033306/https://www.thetrainline.com/en/train-times/barcelona-to-paris|url-status=live}}</ref> This new line passes through [[Girona]] and [[Figueres]] with a [[Perthus Tunnel|tunnel]] through the Pyrenees.

According to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013, Spanish is the most spoken language in Catalonia (46.53%{{nbsp}}claim Spanish as "their own language"), followed by [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (37.26%{{nbsp}}claim Catalan as "their own language"). In everyday use, 11.95%{{nbsp}}of the population claim to use both languages equally, whereas 45.92%{{nbsp}}mainly use Spanish and 35.54%{{nbsp}}mainly use Catalan. There is a significant difference between the [[Barcelona metropolitan area]] (and, to a lesser extent, the [[Camp de Tarragona|Tarragona area]]), where Spanish is more spoken than Catalan, and the more rural and small town areas, where Catalan clearly prevails over Spanish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idescat.cat/dequavi/?TC=444&V0=15&V1=2|title=Idescat.

Originating in the historic territory of Catalonia, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] has enjoyed special status since the approval of the [[Statute of Autonomy of 1979]] which declares it to be "Catalonia's own language",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gencat.cat/generalitat/eng/estatut/titol_preliminar.htm#a6|title=Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia (Article 6)|publisher=Gencat.cat|access-date=25 April 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528011550/http://www.gencat.cat/generalitat/eng/estatut/titol_preliminar.htm#a6|archive-date=28 May 2008}}</ref> a term which signifies a language given special legal status within a Spanish territory, or which is historically spoken within a given region. The other languages with official status in Catalonia are Spanish, which has official status throughout Spain, and Aranese Occitan, which is spoken in Val d'Aran.

Since the [[Statute of Autonomy of 1979]], [[Aranese]] (a [[Gascon dialect|Gascon]] dialect of [[Occitan language|Occitan]]) has also been official and subject to special protection in [[Val d'Aran]]. This small area of 7,000{{nbsp}}inhabitants was the only place where a dialect of Occitan had received full official status. Then, on 9{{nbsp}}August{{nbsp}}2006, when the new Statute came into force, Occitan became official throughout Catalonia. Occitan is the mother tongue of 22.4% of the population of Val d'Aran, which has attracted heavy immigration from other Spanish regions to work in the service industry.<ref>[http://www20.gencat.cat/docs/Llengcat/Documents/Dades_territori_poblacio/Altres/Arxius/EULP2008.pdf Enquesta d'usos lingüístics de la població 2008] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709132415/http://www20.gencat.cat/docs/Llengcat/Documents/Dades_territori_poblacio/Altres/Arxius/EULP2008.pdf|date=9 July 2011}}, cap. 8. ''La Val d'Aran''.</ref> [[Catalan Sign Language]] is also officially recognised.<ref name="estatut_langs" />

Although not considered an "official language" in the same way as Catalan, Spanish, and Occitan, the [[Catalan Sign Language]], with about 18,000 users in Catalonia,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=csc|title=Catalan Sign Language|publisher=Ethnologue.com|date=19 February 1999|access-date=1 July 2014|archive-date=3 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003051354/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=csc|url-status=live}}</ref> is granted official recognition and support: "The public authorities shall guarantee the use of Catalan sign language and conditions of equality for deaf people who choose to use this language, which shall be the subject of education, protection and respect."<ref name="estatut_langs"/>

As was the case since the ascent of the Bourbon dynasty to the throne of Spain after the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], and with the exception of the short period of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], under [[Francoist Spain]] Catalan was banned from schools and all other official use, so that for example families were not allowed to officially register children with Catalan names.<ref>{{cite book|author=Joan Miralles i Montserrat|author2=Josep Massot i Muntaner|title=Entorn de la histáoria de la llengua|year=2001|publisher=L'Abadia de Montserrat|isbn=978-84-8415-309-2|page=72}}</ref> Although never completely banned, Catalan language publishing was severely restricted during the early 1940s, with only religious texts and small-run self-published texts being released. Some books were published clandestinely or circumvented the restrictions by showing publishing dates prior to 1936.<ref>{{cite book|author=Pelai Pagès i Blanch|title=Franquisme i repressió: la repressió franquista als països catalans 1939–1975 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWDyyyaL7dMC&pg=PA182|access-date=6 January 2011|year=2004|publisher=Universitat de València|isbn=978-84-370-5924-2|archive-date=8 April 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220408064809/https://books.google.com/books?id=OWDyyyaL7dMC&pg=PA182|url-status=live}}</ref> This policy was changed in 1946, when restricted publishing in Catalan resumed.<ref>{{cite book|author=Pelai Pagès i Blanch|title=Franquisme i repressió: la repressió franquista als països catalans (1939–1975) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWDyyyaL7dMC&pg=PA182|year=2004|publisher=Universitat de València|isbn=978-84-370-5924-2|access-date=9 November 2020|archive-date=8 April 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220408064809/https://books.google.com/books?id=OWDyyyaL7dMC&pg=PA182|url-status=live}}</ref>

Rural–urban migration originating in other parts of Spain also reduced the social use of Catalan in urban areas and increased the use of Spanish. Lately, a similar [[sociolinguistic]] phenomenon has occurred with foreign immigration. Catalan cultural activity increased in the 1960s and the teaching of Catalan began thanks to the initiative of associations such as [[Òmnium Cultural]].

After the end of Francoist Spain, the newly established self-governing democratic institutions in Catalonia embarked on a long-term [[language policy]] to recover the use of Catalan<ref>{{cite book|author=Turell, M.

This policy, known as the "linguistic normalisation" ({{lang|ca|normalització lingüística}} in Catalan, {{lang|es|normalización lingüística}} in Spanish) has been supported by the vast majority of Catalan political parties through the last thirty years.

Today, Catalan is the main language of the Catalan autonomous government and the other public institutions that fall under its jurisdiction. Basic public education is given mainly in Catalan, but also there are some hours per week of Spanish medium instruction. Although businesses are required by law to display all information (e.g. menus, posters) at least in Catalan, this not systematically enforced. There is no obligation to display this information in either Occitan or Spanish, although there is no restriction on doing so in these or other languages. The use of fines was introduced in a 1997 linguistic law<ref>{{cite web|url=http://llengua.gencat.cat/permalink/78000b57-5382-11e4-8f3f-000c29cdf219|title=Catalonia's linguistic law|publisher=gencat.cat|access-date=16 August 2017|archive-date=20 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720133246/http://llengua.gencat.cat/permalink/78000b57-5382-11e4-8f3f-000c29cdf219|url-status=live}}</ref> that aims to increase the public use of Catalan and defend the rights of Catalan speakers. On the other hand, the Spanish Constitution does not recognize equal language rights for national minorities since it enshrined Spanish as the only official language of the state, the knowledge of which being compulsory. Numerous laws regarding for instance the labelling of pharmaceutical products, make in effect Spanish the only language of compulsory use.

The law ensures that both Catalan and Spanish – being official languages – can be used by the citizens without prejudice in all public and private activities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://llengua.gencat.cat/permalink/78000b57-5382-11e4-8f3f-000c29cdf219|title=Second article of Catalonia's linguistic law|publisher=gencat.cat|access-date=16 August 2017|archive-date=20 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720133246/http://llengua.gencat.cat/permalink/78000b57-5382-11e4-8f3f-000c29cdf219|url-status=live}}</ref> The Generalitat uses Catalan in its communications and notifications addressed to the general population, but citizens can also receive information from the Generalitat in Spanish if they so wish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://llengua.gencat.cat/permalink/78000b57-5382-11e4-8f3f-000c29cdf219|title=Ninth article of Catalonia's Linguistic Law|publisher=gencat.cat|access-date=16 August 2017|archive-date=20 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720133246/http://llengua.gencat.cat/permalink/78000b57-5382-11e4-8f3f-000c29cdf219|url-status=live}}</ref> Debates in the Catalan Parliament take place almost exclusively in Catalan and the [[TV3 (Catalonia)|Catalan public television]] broadcasts programs mainly in Catalan.

The Catalan language policy has been challenged by some political parties in the Catalan Parliament. [[Citizens - Party of the Citizenry|Citizens]], currently the main opposition party, has been one of the most consistent critics of the Catalan language policy within Catalonia.

Catalonia has given to the world many important figures in the area of the art. Catalan painters internationally known are, among others, [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Joan Miró]] and [[Antoni Tàpies]]. Closely linked with the Catalan pictorial atmosphere, [[Pablo Picasso]] lived in Barcelona during his youth, training them as an artist and creating the movement of [[cubism]]. Other important artists are [[Claudi Lorenzale]] for the medieval [[Romanticism]] that marked the artistic Renaixença, [[Marià Fortuny]] for the Romanticism and Catalan Orientalism of the nineteenth century, [[Ramon Casas]] or [[Santiago Rusiñol]], main representatives of the pictorial current of Catalan modernism from the end of the nineteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, [[Josep Maria Sert]] for early 20th-century [[Noucentisme]], or [[Josep Maria Subirachs]] for expressionist or abstract sculpture and painting of the late twentieth century.

In the field of architecture were developed and adapted to Catalonia different artistic styles prevalent in Europe, leaving footprints in many churches, monasteries and cathedrals, of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]<ref>Antoni Pladevall i Font: ''El Romànic català''. A ''El llibre d'or de l'art català''.</ref> (the best examples of which are located in the northern half of the territory) and [[Gothic style]]s. The Gothic developed in Barcelona and its area of influence is known as [[Catalan Gothic]], with some particular characteristics. The church of [[Santa Maria del Mar, Barcelona|Santa Maria del Mar]] is an example of this kind of style. During the Middle Ages, many fortified castles were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers.

There are some examples of [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] (such as the Palau de la Generalitat), [[Baroque]] and [[Neoclassical architecture]]s. In the late nineteenth century [[Modernisme|Modernism]] ([[Art Nouveau]]) appeared as the national art. The world-renowned Catalan architects of this style are [[Antoni Gaudí]], [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]] and [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]]. Thanks to the urban expansion of Barcelona during the last decades of the century and the first ones of the next, many buildings of the [[Eixample]] are modernists. In the field of [[architectural rationalism]], which turned especially relevant in Catalonia during the Republican era (1931–1939) highlighting [[Josep Lluís Sert]] and Josep Torres i Clavé, members of the [[GATCPAC]] and, in contemporany architecture, [[Ricardo Bofill]] and [[Enric Miralles]].

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Literature of Catalonia}}
The oldest surviving literary use of the Catalan language is considered to be the religious text known as [[Homilies d'Organyà]], written either in late 11th or early 12th{{nbsp}}century.

There are two historical moments of splendor of Catalan literature. The first begins with the historiographic chronicles of the 13th{{nbsp}}century (chronicles written between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries narrating the deeds of the monarchs and leading figures of the Crown of Aragon) and the subsequent Golden Age of the 14th and 15th{{nbsp}}centuries. After that period, between the 16th and 19th{{nbsp}}centuries the Romantic [[historiography]] defined this era as the {{lang|ca|[[Decadència]]}}, considered as the "decadent" period in Catalan literature because of a general falling into disuse of the vernacular language in cultural contexts and lack of patronage among the nobility.

[[File:Rodoreda.jpg|upright=0.65|thumb|left|[[Mercè Rodoreda]] ]]
The second moment of splendor began in the 19th{{nbsp}}century with the cultural and political {{lang|ca|[[Renaixença]]}} (Renaissance) represented by writers and poets such as [[Jacint Verdaguer]], [[Víctor Català]] (pseudonym of [[Caterina Albert i Paradís]]), [[Narcís Oller]], [[Joan Maragall]] and [[Àngel Guimerà]]. During the 20th{{nbsp}}century, avant-garde movements developed, initiated by the Generation of '14 (called [[Noucentisme]] in Catalonia), represented by [[Eugenio d'Ors]], [[Joan Salvat-Papasseit]], [[Josep Carner]], [[Carles Riba]], [[Josep Vicenç Foix i Mas|J.V. Foix]] and others. During the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, the Civil War ([[Generation of '36]]) and the Francoist period, Catalan literature was maintained despite the repression against the Catalan language, being often produced in exile.

[[File:Ana María Matute.jpg|upright=0.65|thumb|[[Ana María Matute]] ]]
The most outstanding authors of this period are [[Salvador Espriu]], [[Josep Pla]], [[Josep Maria de Sagarra]] (who are considered mainly responsible for the renewal of Catalan prose), [[Mercè Rodoreda]], Joan Oliver Sallarès or "[[Pere Quart]]", [[Pere Calders]], [[Gabriel Ferrater]], [[Manuel de Pedrolo]], [[Agustí Bartra]] or [[Miquel Martí i Pol]]. In addition, several foreign writers who fought in the [[International Brigades]], or other military units, have since recounted their experiences of fighting in their works, historical or fictional, with for example, [[George Orwell]], in ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938) or [[Claude Simon]]'s ''Le Palace'' (1962) and ''Les Géorgiques'' (1981).

After the transition to democracy (1975–1978) and the restoration of the Generalitat (1977), literary life and the editorial market have returned to normality and literary production in Catalan is being bolstered with a number of language policies intended to protect Catalan culture. Besides the aforementioned authors, other relevant 20th-century writers of the Francoist and democracy periods include [[Joan Brossa]], [[Agustí Bartra]], [[Manuel de Pedrolo]], [[Pere Calders]] or [[Quim Monzó]].

[[Ana María Matute]], [[Jaime Gil de Biedma]], [[Manuel Vázquez Montalbán]] and [[Juan Goytisolo]] are among the most prominent Catalan writers in the Spanish language since the democratic restoration in Spain.

[[File:Monument als castellers (Tarragona), 1.jpg|thumb|''Monument als castellers'' ([[Tarragona]])]]
[[Castell]]s are one of the main manifestations of Catalan popular culture. The activity consists in constructing human towers by competing {{lang|ca|colles castelleres}} (teams). This practice originated in [[Valls]], on the region of the Camp de Tarragona,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Tarragona, City of Human Towers – Tarragona Turisme|url=https://www.tarragonaturisme.cat/en/tarragona-city-human-towers|access-date=2023-03-29|website=www.tarragonaturisme.cat|archive-date=29 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230329184858/https://www.tarragonaturisme.cat/en/tarragona-city-human-towers|url-status=live}}</ref> during the 18th century, and later it was extended to the rest of the territory, especially in the late 20th century. The tradition of [[Castell|els Castells i els Castellers]] was declared Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by [[UNESCO]] in 2010.

In main celebrations, other elements of the Catalan popular culture<ref>-Joan Prat i Jesús Contreras. Conèixer Catalunya. Les Festes Populars. Editorial Dopesa 2. 1979. 159 pp. Idioma català. {{ISBN|84-7235-438-5}}.</ref> are also usually present: parades with {{lang|ca|[[Gegants i capgrossos|gegants]]}} (giants), bigheads, stick-dancers and musicians, and the {{lang|ca|[[correfoc]]}}, where devils and monsters dance and spray showers of sparks using firecrackers. Another traditional celebration in Catalonia is {{lang|ca|[[Patum de Berga|La Patum de Berga]]}}, declared a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by the [[UNESCO]] on 25 November 2005.<ref>[http://www.bergueda.com/lapatum/festa.asp Patum de Berga]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227050231/http://www.bergueda.com/lapatum/festa.asp|date=27 February 2009}}</ref>
[[File:Festa major de la Seu d'Urgell.JPG|thumb|left|{{lang|ca|[[Gigantes y cabezudos|Gegants i capgrossos]]}} during the festa major of [[La Seu d'Urgell]] ]]

[[Christmas]] in Catalonia lasts two days, plus [[Christmas Eve]]. On the 25th, Christmas is celebrated, followed by a similar feast on the 26, called Sant Esteve (Saint Steve's Day). This allows families to visit and dine with different sectors of the extended family or get together with friends on the second day.

One of the most deeply rooted and curious [[Christmas traditions]] is the popular figure of the {{lang|ca|[[Tió de Nadal]]}}, consisting of an (often hollow) log with a face painted on it and often two little front legs appended, usually wearing a Catalan hat and scarf. The word has nothing to do with the Spanish word ''tío'', meaning uncle. ''Tió'' means log in Catalan. The log is sometimes "found in the woods" (in an event staged for children) and then adopted and taken home, where it is fed and cared for during a month or so. On [[Christmas Day]] or on [[Christmas Eve]], a game is played where children march around the house singing a song requesting the log to poop, then they hit the log with a stick, to make it poop, and lo and behold, as if through magic, it poops candy, and sometimes other small gifts. Usually, the larger or main gifts are brought by the Three Kings on 6 January, and the tió only brings small things.
[[File:Tió de Nadal.jpg|thumb|A tió exhibited at Plaça Sant Jaume in Barcelona in the 2010–2011 Christmas season]]

Another custom is to make a {{lang|ca|pessebre}} (nativity scene) in the home or in shop windows, the latter sometimes competing in originality or sheer size and detail. Churches often host exhibits of numerous dioramas by nativity scene makers, or a single nativity scene they put out, and town halls generally put out a nativity scene in the central square. In Barcelona, every year, the main nativity scene is designed by different artists, and often ends up being an interesting, post-modern or conceptual and strange creation. In the home, the nativity scene often consists of strips of cork bark to represent cliffs or mountains in the background, moss as grass in the foreground, some wood chips or other as dirt, and aluminum foil for rivers and lakes. The traditional figurines often included are the three wise men on camels or horses, which are moved every day or so to go closer to the manger, a star with a long tail in the background to lead people to the spot, the annunciation with shepherds having a meal and an angel appearing (hanging from something), a washer lady washing clothes in the pond, sheep, ducks, people carrying packages on their backs, a donkey driver with a load of twigs, and atrezzo such as a starry sky, miniature towns placed in the distance, either Oriental-styled or local-looking, a bridge over the river, trees, etc.

One of the most astonishing and sui-generis figurines traditionally placed in the nativity scene, to the great glee of children, is the {{lang|ca|[[caganer]]}}, a person depicted in the act of defecating.<ref name="BBC News">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12059969|title=A traditional Nativity scene, Catalan-style|work=BBC News|date=23 December 2010|access-date=23 December 2010|archive-date=12 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190212182619/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12059969|url-status=live}}</ref> This figurine is hidden in some corner of the nativity scene and the game is to detect it. Of course, churches forgo this figurine, and the main nativity scene of Barcelona, for instance, likewise does not feature it. The caganer is so popular it has, together with the tió, long been a major part of the Christmas markets, where they come in the guise of your favorite politicians or other famous people, as well as the traditional figures of a Catalan farmer. People often buy a figurine of a caganer in the guise of a famous person they are actually fond of, contrary to what one would imagine, though sometimes people buy a caganer in the guise of someone they dislike, although this means they have to look at them in the home.

Another (extended) Christmas tradition is the celebration of the Epiphany on 6 January, which is called ''Reis'', meaning Three Kings Day. This is every important in Catalonia and the Catalan-speaking areas, and families go to watch major parades on the eve of the Epiphany, where they can greet the kings and watch them pass by in pomp and circumstance, on floats and preceded and followed by pages, musicians, dancers, etc. They often give the kings letters with their gift requests, which are collected by the pages. On the next day, the children find the gifts the three kings brought for them.

In addition to traditional local Catalan culture, traditions from other parts of Spain can be found as a result of migration from other regions, for instance the celebration of the Andalusian {{lang|es|[[Seville Fair|Feria de Abril]]}} in Catalonia.

On 28 July 2010, second only after the [[Canary Islands]], [[Ban on bullfighting in Catalonia|Catalonia became another Spanish territory to forbid bullfighting]]. The ban, which went into effect on 1 January 2012, had originated in a popular petition supported by over 180,000 signatures.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tremlett|first1=Giles|title=Catalonia votes to ban bullfighting|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/28/bullfighting-ban-spain-catalonia|access-date=11 October 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 July 2010|archive-date=12 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012045159/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/28/bullfighting-ban-spain-catalonia|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[sardana]] is considered to be the most characteristic Catalan folk dance, interpreted to the rhythm of [[Tambori|tamborí]], [[tible]] and [[tenora]] (from the oboe family), [[trumpet]], trombó ([[trombone]]), fiscorn (family of bugles) and contrabaix with three strings played by a [[cobla]], and are danced in a circle dance. Other tunes and dances of the traditional music are the contrapàs (obsolete today), [[ball de bastons]] (the "dance of sticks"), the moixiganga, the goigs (popular songs), the [[galop]]s or the [[Jota (music)|jota]] in the southern part. The {{lang|ca|[[Habanera (music)|havaneres]]}} are characteristic in some marine localities of the Costa Brava, especially during the summer months when these songs are sung outdoors accompanied by a {{lang|ca|cremat}} of burned rum.

Art music was first developed, up to the nineteenth century and, as in much of Europe, in a liturgical setting, particularly marked by the Escolania de Montserrat. The main Western musical trends have marked these productions, medieval monodies or polyphonies, with the work of [[Abbot Oliba]] in the eleventh century or the compilation [[Llibre Vermell de Montserrat]] ("Red Book of Montserrat") from the fourteenth century. Through the Renaissance there were authors such as [[Pere Albert Vila]], [[Joan Brudieu]] or the two [[Mateu Fletxa]] ("The Old" and "The Young"). Baroque had composers like [[Joan Cererols]]. The Romantic music was represented by composers such as [[Fernando Sor]], [[Josep Anselm Clavé]] (father of choir movement in Catalonia and responsible of the music folk reviving) or [[Felip Pedrell]].

Modernisme also expressed in musical terms from the end of the 19th century onwards, mixing folkloric and post-romantic influences, through the works of [[Isaac Albéniz]] and [[Enric Granados]]. The avant-garde spirit initiated by the modernists is prolonged throughout the twentieth century, thanks to the activities of the [[Orfeó Català]], a choral society founded in 1891, with its monumental concert hall, the [[Palau de la Música Catalana]] in Catalan, built by Lluís Domènech i Montaner from 1905 to 1908, the [[Barcelona Symphony Orchestra]] created in 1944 and composers, conductors and musicians engaged against the Francoism like [[Robert Gerhard]], [[Eduard Toldrà]] and [[Pau Casals]].

Performances of [[opera]], mostly imported from Italy, began in the 18th century, but some native operas were written as well, including the ones by [[Domènec Terradellas]], [[Carles Baguer]], [[Ramon Carles]], Isaac Albéniz and Enric Granados. The Barcelona main opera house, [[Gran Teatre del Liceu]] (opened in 1847), remains one of the most important in Spain, hosting one of the most prestigious music schools in Barcelona, the [[Conservatori Superior de Música del Liceu]]. Several lyrical artists trained by this institution gained international renown during the 20th century, such as [[Victoria de los Ángeles]], [[Montserrat Caballé]], [[Giacomo Aragall]] and [[Josep Carreras]].

Cellist [[Pau Casals]] is admired as an outstanding player. Other popular musical styles were born in the second half of the 20th century such as [[Nova Cançó]] from the 1960s with [[Lluís Llach]] and the group [[Els Setze Jutges]], the [[Catalan rumba]] in the 1960s with [[Peret]], [[Catalan Rock]] from the late 1970s with [[La Banda Trapera del Río]] and [[Decibelios]] for Punk Rock, [[Sau (band)|Sau]], [[Els Pets]], [[Sopa de Cabra]] or [[Lax'n'Busto]] for [[pop rock]] or [[Sangtraït]] for hard rock, electropop since the 1990s with [[OBK]] and [[indie pop]] from the 1990s.

[[File:TVC.svg|thumb|Logo of Televisió de Catalunya]]
Catalonia is the autonomous community, along with Madrid, that has the most media (TV, magazines, newspapers etc.). In Catalonia there is a wide variety of local and comarcal media. With the restoration of democracy, many newspapers and magazines, until then in the hands of the Franco government, were recovered in order to convert them into free and democratic media, while local radios and televisions were implemented.

[[Televisió de Catalunya]], which broadcasts entirely in the Catalan language, is the main Catalan public TV. It has five channels: [[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]], [[El 33]], [[Super3]], [[3/24]], [[Esport3]] and [[TV3CAT]].

Catalonia has a long tradition of use of radio, the first regular radio broadcast in the country was from Ràdio Barcelona in 1924.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1974/04/24/049.html|title=ABC (Madrid) – 24/04/1974, p. 49 – ABC.es Hemeroteca |access-date=22 October 2018|website=hemeroteca.abc.es|language=es|archive-date=30 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180630025203/http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1974/04/24/049.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Today, the public [[Catalunya Ràdio]] (owned by [[Corporació Catalana de Mitjans Audiovisuals|Catalan Media Corporation]]) and the private [[RAC 1]] (belonging to Grup Godó) are the two main radios of Catalonia, both in Catalan.

[[File:Festival Internacional de Cinema de Catalunya 2009.JPG|thumb|[[Sitges Film Festival]] of 2009]]
Regarding the cinema, after the democratic transition, three styles have dominated since then. First, auteur cinema, in the continuity of the [[Barcelona School of Film|Barcelona School]], emphasizes experimentation and form, while focusing on developing social and political themes. Worn first by [[Josep Maria Forn]] or [[Bigas Luna]], then by [[Marc Recha]], [[Jaime Rosales]] and [[Albert Serra]], this genre has achieved some international recognition. Then, the [[documentary]] became another genre particularly representative of contemporary Catalan cinema, boosted by [[Joaquim Jordà i Català]] and [[José Luis Guerín]]. Later, horror films and thrillers have also emerged as a specialty of the Catalan film industry, thanks in particular to the vitality of the [[Sitges Film Festival]], created in 1968. Several directors have gained worldwide renown thanks to this genre, starting with Jaume Balagueró and his series ''[[REC (film)|REC]]'' (co-directed with Valencian Paco Plaza), [[Juan Antonio Bayona]] and ''[[El orfanato|El Orfanato]]'' or [[Jaume Collet-Serra]] with ''[[Orphan (2009 film)|Orphan]]'', ''[[Unknown (2011 film)|Unknown]]'' and ''[[Non-Stop (film)|Non-Stop]]''.

Catalan actors have shot for Spanish and international productions, such as [[Sergi López (actor)|Sergi López]].
