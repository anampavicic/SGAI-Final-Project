'''Puerto Vallarta''' ({{IPA|es|ˈpweɾto βaˈʎaɾta}} or simply '''Vallarta''') is a Mexican beach [[resort city]] on the Pacific Ocean's [[Bahía de Banderas]] in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Jalisco]]. Puerto Vallarta is the second largest [[urban agglomeration]] in the state after the [[Guadalajara Metropolitan Area]]. The City of Puerto Vallarta is the government seat of the Municipality of Puerto Vallarta, which comprises the city as well as population centers outside of the city extending from [[Boca de Tomatlán]] to the [[Nayarit]] border (the [[Ameca River]]). The city is located at {{Coord|20|40|N|105|16|W|}}. The municipality has an area of {{convert|262.9|sqmi|km2|order=flip}}. To the north, it borders the southwest of the state of [[Nayarit]]. To the east, it borders the municipality of Mascota and [[San Sebastián del Oeste]], and to the south, it borders the municipalities of Talpa de Allende and Cabo Corrientes.<ref>Guia Roji – ''Ciudad de Puerto Vallarta'' (map)</ref>

Puerto Vallarta is named after [[Ignacio Vallarta]], a former [[governor of Jalisco]]. In Spanish, ''Puerto Vallarta'' is frequently shortened to "Vallarta", while English speakers call the city '''P.V.''' for short. In Internet shorthand, the city is often referred to as PVR, after the [[International Air Transport Association airport code]] for its [[Lic. Gustavo Díaz Ordaz International Airport|Gustavo Diaz Ordaz International Airport]].

==History==
=== Playa Los Muertos (Beach of the Dead) ===
{{Main|Playa de los Muertos (Puerto Vallarta)}}
In the 16th century, [[Hernán Cortés]] explored the Pacific side of Mexico by ship. Cortés used the established port of [[Acapulco]] to resupply and anchor his ships along the journey. During the early 1500s, he sent two of his ships North to explore the coastline without him. One of his ships wrecked in Banderas Bay and all but three men were reportedly killed. It is believed the corpses of the lost sailors washed ashore. Native villagers encountered numerous corpses on the beach for days after the wreck.<ref>{{cite web |last1=LOUDAMY |first1=RANDALL RAY |title=CORTÉS AFTER THE CONQUEST OF MEXICO: CONSTRUCTING LEGACY IN NEW SPAIN |url=https://shareok.org/bitstream/handle/11244/14979/Loudamy_okstate_0664D_13123.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y |publisher=Oklahoma State University |access-date=29 January 2023}}</ref>

=== Bahía de Banderas (Bay of Flags) ===
Pirates were known to attack ships along the Pacific Coast of Mexico as early as the 16th century. In the early 1500s the famous explorer [[Hernán Cortés]] set out to establish a [[Place of refuge for ships|safe harbor]], north of Acapulco, to provide protection for cargo ships sailing the planned [[Manila galleon]] trade route to the Philippines. Just several hundred miles north, he discovered a large bay at the village of Tintoque. According to local legend, pirates were already anchoring in this bay and regularly pillaged local villagers while burying treasure in the hills. When Cortes and his crew set foot on the beach, a mob of angry villagers believed he and his crew were pirates and surrounded them with native weapons in hand. According to his journal, a Catholic friar accompanying the crew began praying to the Lord for help. Villagers were mesmerized by the red flags the crew carried and suddenly lowered their weapons, allowing the explorers to pass peacefully. It's likely the villagers had seen the flags before when they floated ashore with the dead crew from a Cortés' ship that wrecked earlier in the bay. This is how the Bahía de Banderas was named. Francisco Cortés de Buenaventura, the nephew of [[Hernán Cortés]], is said to have formalized the bay's name during his own conquering of the region in 1525. In the following years, Tintoque became a major port and safe harbor for ships traveling the [[Manila galleon]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Playa Los Muertos |url=https://www.exploratoryglory.com/lake-it-and-love-it-lake-reviews/playa-los-muertos-puerto-vallarta |website=exploratoryglory.com |publisher=TRAVEL, PHOTOGRAPHY AND TINY HOUSE LIVING |access-date=28 January 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Harris |first1=Kathleen |title=December 12, 2011 Marks 160th Anniversary of Vallarta's Founding |url=http://www.banderasnews.com/1112/nb-pv160anniversary.htm |website=banderasnews.com |publisher=Banderas News |access-date=29 January 2023}}</ref>

===Pre-Hispanic times to the 19th century===

Few details are known about the history of the area prior to the 19th century. There is archaeological evidence to suggest continuous human habitation from 580 BC, and similar evidence (from sites near Ixtapa and in Col. Lázaro Cárdenas)<ref>The archaeologist in charge of these digs maintains a website with information related to them (in Spanish), one for the [http://www.uncg.edu/arc/Vallarta/HTML/pv1.html Ixtapa] site, and one for the [http://www.uncg.edu/arc/Vallarta/HTML/pv28.html Calle Costa Rica] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003007/http://www.uncg.edu/arc/Vallarta/HTML/pv28.html |date=2007-09-27 }} site.</ref> that the area belonged to the [[Aztlán]] culture which dominated [[Jalisco]], [[Nayarit]] and [[Michoacán]] from {{circa|900–1200}}. The limited evidence in occidental Mexican archeology have limited the current knowledge about pre-historic life in the area.<ref>An example of this neglect is the City of Puerto Vallarta's destruction of the active excavation in the area of Calle Costa Rica and the Libramiento in 1995 to create a soccer field. See the [http://www.uncg.edu/arc/Vallarta/HTML/pv28.html website of the archeologist] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003007/http://www.uncg.edu/arc/Vallarta/HTML/pv28.html |date=2007-09-27 }} who led the dig for details.</ref>

===El Carrizal and Las Peñas – 19th century ===

The official founding story of Las Peñas and thus of Puerto Vallarta is that it was founded by Guadalupe Sánchez Torres, his wife Ambrosia Carrillo and some friends such as Cenobio Joya, Apolonio de Robles, Cleofas Peña and Martín Andrade, among others, on December 12, 1851, and was given the name of Las Peñas de Santa María de Guadalupe since it was the day dedicated to the virgin of Guadalupe. Although the purchase record of the property by Guadalupe Sanchez is dated 1859, his family lived there prior to the purchase year.<ref>Familia Sanchez Carrillo family records C.Haro</ref><ref>Munguia Fregoso – ''Panorámica'' p. 66</ref>

There is however no doubt the development of Las Peñas into a self-sustaining village of any significant size happened in the 1860s as the mouth of the Cuale area was exploited to support the operations of the newly enfranchised Union en Cuale company. As such 1859 marks the beginning of Puerto Vallarta as a village. Twenty years later, by 1885, the village comprised about 250 homes and about 800 residents.<ref>Munguia Fregoso – ''Panorámica'' p. 68</ref>

===The modern resort – 20th century to present===
[[File:Crkva u meksičkom gradu Puerto Vallarti.jpg|thumb|Closer view of the church]]The Mexican government invested significantly in transportation improvements, making Puerto Vallarta an easy travel destination. To make Puerto Vallarta accessible by jet aircraft the government developed the city's [[Licenciado Gustavo Díaz Ordaz International Airport|international airport]]. Ground transportation significantly improved. Government invested heavily in the development of highway and utility infrastructure. Another vital improvement for the city was the El Salado wharf (where the current cruise terminal is), inaugurated on June 1, 1970, making Puerto Vallarta Jalisco's first harbor town.<ref>C. Munguía F., Panorama Histórico de Puerto Vallarta y de la Bahía de Banderas. (Secretaría de Cultura Gobierno de Jalisco H. Ayuntamiento de Puerto Vallarta, 1997) pp. 200</ref>

During the mid-1980s, Puerto Vallarta experienced a rapid expansion of impromptu communities poorly served by even basic public services. This very low standard of living leveled out Puerto Vallarta's resort boom. In the late 1980s Puerto Vallarta's government worked to alleviate the situation by developing housing and infrastructure. But the legacy of the 1980s boom remains, as the outlying areas of Puerto Vallarta suffer from poor provision of basic services (i.e. water, sewage, roads).<ref>Read almost any issue of the local newspapers and you will see an endless procession of complaints by the residents of outlying neighborhoods about poor road, sewage and water supply. See Munguia Fregoso – ''Panorámica'' p. 132-3 for the chronology that ties this situation to the peso devaluation crisis of the early 80s.</ref>

==Geography==

[[File:Puerto Vallarta 071.jpg|thumb|right|Beaches of Puerto Vallarta]]

Puerto Vallarta lies on a narrow coastal plain at the foot of the Sierras Cuale and San Sebastián, parts of the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]]. The plain widens to the north, reaching its widest point along the Ameca river. Three rivers flow from the Sierra through the area. From south to north they are the Cuale, the Pitillal, and the Ameca. A number of arroyos also run from the Sierra to the coastal plain. Many of the valleys of these rivers and arroyos are inhabited. Also development has to some extent spread up the hillsides from the coastal plain.

The city proper comprises four main areas: the hotel zone along the shore to the north, Olas Altas – Colonia Emiliano Zapata to the south of the Cuale river (recently named ''[[Zona Romántica]]'' in some tourist brochures), the ''Centro'' along the shore between these two areas, and a number of residential areas to the east of the hotel zone. The oldest section of the town is the area of Col. Centro near the church of Our Lady of Guadalupe, especially Hidalgo street.

===Seismic history===
Puerto Vallarta, like much of the west coast of North America, is prone to earthquakes, though Puerto Vallarta tends to experience only peripheral effects of earthquakes centered farther south. On 9 October 1995, an [[1995 Colima–Jalisco earthquake|earthquake]] located off the [[Colima]] coast shook the crown from the top of the Roman Catholic Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://visitapuertovallarta.com.mx/blog/la-parroquia-de-nuestra-senora-de-guadalupe-punto-de-referencia-de-puerto-vallarta|title=La Parroquia de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, punto de referencia de Puerto Vallarta|language=es|date=3 October 2016|access-date=26 August 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.puertovallarta.net/espanol/que-hacer/esculturas-17-corona-parroquia-guadalupe|title=Corona de la Parroquia de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe (Rafael Parra Castillo y José Esteban Ramírez Guareño, 1963)|language=es|newspaper=Puerto Vallarta Net|date=30 September 2017|access-date=26 August 2021}}</ref>

===Climate===
Puerto Vallarta has a [[tropical savanna climate|Tropical wet and dry]] climate ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Aw''), with dry winters and rainy summers.<ref>[[Media:World Köppen Map.png|Wikimedia.org]]</ref> The average daily high temperature is {{convert|86|°F|°C|0}}; average daily low temperature is {{convert|70|°F|°C|0}}; average daily humidity is 75%. The rainy season extends from mid June through mid October, with most of the rain between July and September. August is the city's wettest month, with an average of 14 days with significant precipitation. Even during the rainy season precipitation tends to be concentrated in large rainstorms. Occasional tropical storms will bring thunderstorms to the city in November, though the month is typically dry. There is a marked dry season in the winter. February, March and April are the months with the least cloud cover.<ref>Climate data taken from the [http://www.wunderground.com Weather Underground] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321122739/http://www.wunderground.com/ |date=2007-03-21 }} site for 2001–2006.</ref>

Hurricanes seldom strike Puerto Vallarta. In 2002, [[Hurricane Kenna]], a category 5 hurricane, made landfall about {{convert|100|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} northwest of Puerto Vallarta, and the city suffered some damage from the resulting storm surge. In 1971, [[Hurricane Lily (1971)|Hurricane Lily]], a category 1 hurricane, caused serious flooding on the [[Isla Cuale]], prompting the city to relocate all of its residents to the new Colonia Palo Seco.

===Hurricane Patricia===
[[Hurricane Patricia]], a Category 5 storm, became the most powerful [[cyclone]] ever measured in the [[Western Hemisphere]] with sustained wind speeds up to {{convert|200|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Hurricane Patricia was forecast to make landfall at Puerto Vallarta on the evening of October 23, 2015, with catastrophic damage predicted for the town and surrounding areas and the potential for mud slides. The storm changed from a Category 1 to a Category 5 in just 24 hours, thus catching some vacationers off guard and leaving many trapped in the town. The Jalisco state government put together 30 buses to evacuate tourists from the coast to [[Guadalajara]], a 5-hour ride inland. [[Manzanillo, Colima]] was also near the forecast catastrophic damage zone. Ultimately, Patricia weakened and made landfall south of Puerto Vallarta, sparing the city from any significant damage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPEP5+shtml/230238.shtml|title=Post-Tropical Cyclone Selma Public Advisory|website=www.nhc.noaa.gov|access-date=9 February 2018}}</ref><ref>[http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/T/TROPICAL_WEATHER?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2015-10-23-08-12-12 AP, Mexico braces for strongest hurricane in Western hemisphere, By CHRISTOPHER SHERMAN, with Associated Press, Oct 23, 11:53 AM EDT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024151859/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/T/TROPICAL_WEATHER?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2015-10-23-08-12-12 |date=2015-10-24 }}</ref>

==== Real estate tourism ====
[[File:Velas Vallarta, Puerto Vallarta (2014) - 91.JPG|thumb|right|Velas Vallarta Hotel]]
Puerto Vallarta has become a popular retirement destination for U.S. and Canadian retirees. This has created a number of neighborhoods within the Puerto Vallarta region that cater primarily to real estate tourism, such as the Hotel Zone, which stretches from downtown Vallarta to the airport and Marina Vallarta (near the airport), and Amapas and [[Conchas Chinas]], which are built into the mountain slightly south and behind Puerto Vallarta, and overlook the city and bay. Most recently the downtown area, especially in [[Colonia Emiliano Zapata, Puerto Vallarta|Emiliano Zapata]] (also known as the [[Zona Romántica|Romantic Zone]]), has seen a somewhat controversial trend of traditional homes being razed for the construction of condominium buildings. This region in recent years has been the most popular for Vallarta real estate tourism, with nearly 25% of all real estate sales for the region taking place there in 2019.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Vallarta|first=M.

[[File:Puerto Vallarta (February 22, 2023) - 48.jpg|thumb|left|Restaurant at Puerto Vallarta's Downtown]]The Puerto Vallarta real estate tourism market is made up of both full-time retirees and second-home owners, primarily from the United States. On average about 40% of buyers are American, with 30% consisting of Mexican nationals, and Canadians and other foreign buyers making up the remaining 20%. Mexicans favor destinations such as Puerto Vallarta, [[Los Cabos Corridor|Los Cabos]] and [[Cancún]] not just for the sun and beach, but also as real estate investments, as real estate in these regions is priced in USD, rather than in pesos like the rest of the country.<ref name=":0" />

Puerto Vallarta can be classified as a medium-ranged real estate market with a market consisting mostly of condominiums with an average price around US$320,000 in 2019.<ref name=":0" /> Any foreigner wishing to buy real estate in Puerto Vallarta (or anywhere along the coast of Mexico), can't own real estate there outright, but needs to establish a ''[[fideicommissum]]'' or beneficial trust which is held with a Mexican bank on the owner's behalf. It is not the same as holding the title. The trust is good for 50 years and can be renewed for another 50-year period.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Buying Property in Mexico's Restricted Zone {{!}} Connell & Associates|url=https://mexicolaw.com.mx/2017/07/05/buying-property-in-mexicos-restricted-zone/|access-date=2020-06-10|language=en-US}}</ref>

====LGBT tourism====

===Growth-related problems===
Poverty remains a problem, fueled by the constant influx of persons seeking employment. Many areas of the city are still poorly served by roads and sewers. For example, Colonia Ramblases is served by roads in generally poor condition only 10% of which are paved, and Ramblases has been a populated neighborhood since the 1940s.<ref>Mantilla ''Barrios Pobres'' p 16</ref> The Municipality of Puerto Vallarta comprises about 45,000 regular dwellings. Of those, 10% do not have a potable water supply (carrying their water from a public tap), 8% do not have connections to a sewer system or septic system (using instead crude septic pits or dumping sewage directly into waterways), and 4% do not have electricity.<ref>Cuaderno Estadistico Municipal 2000</ref> There have been improvements in 2005 to 2007, such as new [[Mexican Social Security Institute|IMSS]] facilities in [[Versalles, Puerto Vallarta|Col. Versalles]], improvements to several recreation facilities, improved communal beach access policies, etc. Still efforts seem to aim more at quick and visible infrastructure improvements than at solving the more pressing and enduring problem of insufficient infrastructure for basic services.<ref>This is a simple observed fact: high profile projects like those mentioned succeed while year after year little changes in the poorer ''colonias'' where basic services continue to be lacking.</ref>

One positive result of recent growth has been that in relative terms a smaller percentage of the population lives in older and poorly served neighborhoods. A growing number of residents live in housing projects and low-income housing developments which provide at least adequate basic services.<ref>Compare a map of the city in 1990 to one from 2006 and you will see dozens of new ''fraccionamientos'' (housing projects) developed to help absorb the influx of workers.</ref>

==Transportation==
[[File:Puerto Vallarta downtown street.jpg|thumb|right|Taxi in downtown, driving on characteristic cobblestones]]The [[Licenciado Gustavo Díaz Ordaz International Airport]] comprises a commercial international section and a general aviation section.<ref>Airport information comes from the website of the [http://vallarta.aeropuertosgap.com.mx Díaz Ordaz Airport] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609173253/http://vallarta.aeropuertosgap.com.mx/ |date=2007-06-09 }}</ref>

Puerto Vallarta currently has no passenger rail service. Historically, buses connected with nearby [[Tepic]], where there was a passenger rail service on the main north–south trunk of [[Ferromex]]. Heading north, trains continued to [[Nogales, Sonora|Nogales]], opposite its namesake in [[Arizona]]. A spur headed northwest to [[Mexicali]], opposite [[Calexico, California|Calexico]], [[California]]. Service to the east went to [[Guadalajara]] and then to [[Mexico City]].<ref>Thomas Cook Publishing, UK, "Overseas Timetable," May–June 2005, service was indicated on the map, p 123 and absent from the timetable, p. 125.</ref>

As of June 2017, [[Uber]] began operating in Puerto Vallarta.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uber.com/cities/puerto-vallarta/|title=Drive or Ride with Uber in Puerto Vallarta – Uber|website=www.uber.com|access-date=9 February 2018}}</ref> Their arrival has not been without conflict, as there have been confrontations between them and taxi drivers due to their much lower rates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vallartadaily.com/news/puerto-vallarta/taxi-drivers-harass-tourists/|title=Taxi drivers harass tourists in Puerto Vallarta|date=4 September 2017|access-date=9 February 2018}}</ref>

===Beaches and beach towns===

====Beaches in Puerto Vallarta====
*[[Playa Camarones]] (Shrimp Beach) – Colonia [[5 de Diciembre]] (vicinity of Av. Paragua – Hotel Buenaventura. This is the northernmost public beach in the City of Puerto Vallarta proper. It is named after the shrimp fishermen that once landed their launches on the beach to unload their catch.<ref>Harris – ''Hidden'' p. 159</ref>
*[[Playa Olas Altas]] (High Waves Beach) – Colonia Emiliano Zapata – the beach extends from the Cuale River South to the fishing pier. In spite of the name, the waves offshore are not particularly high, and the beach is a popular place to swim, especially for locals and national tourists. The beach is lined with outdoor restaurants.<ref name="Harris - Hidden p. 175">Harris – ''Hidden'' p. 175</ref>  <!-- the following may be true but as it stands it's tendentious and undocumented and such claims are not allowed in wikipedia aretices: The beaches location near the River Cuale makes it unpopular for international tourist in the summertime. Some beaches in Puerto Vallarta start to appear brown at the mouth of the rivers, in the summertime rains. -->
*[[Playa de los Muertos (Puerto Vallarta)|Playa de los Muertos]] (Beach of the Dead) – Colonia Emiliano Zapata – the city's largest public beach. Legend has it the beach's name (Dead Men's Beach) stems from a battle between pirates and local miners after which bodies remained strewn on the beach, but it's a legend, since there were never any miners in Vallarta. The South Side of the beach is a popular gathering spot for gay and lesbian tourists. The North end is frequented mostly by locals, and national tourists. The city has recently tried to change the name of the beach to Playa del Sol.<ref name="Harris - Hidden p. 175"/>
