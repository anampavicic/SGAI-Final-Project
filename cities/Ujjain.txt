The city has been one of the most prominent trade and political centres of the [[Indian Subcontinent]] from the time of the ancient [[Mahajanapadas|Mahājanapadas]] until the British colonisation of India.

An ancient city situated on the eastern bank of the [[Shipra River]], Ujjain was the most prominent city on the [[Malwa]] plateau of central India for much of its history. It emerged as the political centre of central India around 600 BCE. It was the capital of the ancient [[Avanti (India)|Avanti]] kingdom, one of the sixteen Mahājanapadas. During the 18th century, the city briefly became the capital of the [[Scindia Dynasty|Scindia state]] of the [[Maratha Empire]], when [[Ranoji Scindia]] established his capital at Ujjain in 1731. It remained an important political, commercial, and cultural centre of [[Central India]] until the early 19th century, when the [[British Raj|British]] administrators decided to develop [[Indore]] as an alternative to it. Ujjain continues to be an important place of pilgrimage for [[Shaivism|Shaivite]]s, [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite]]s and [[Shaktism|Shaktas]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Pilgrimage in the Hindu Tradition: Salvific Space |first=Knut A. |last=Jacobsen |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-41559-038-9 |page=128 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kn6_3oBFAqIC&pg=PA128}}</ref><ref name="sahaja">[http://sahajaharidwar.tripod.com/About_Haridwar.html About Haridwar] sahajaharidwar.</ref> Bathing in the holy Shipra river of Ujjain liberates one from sins. Therefore, Ujjain is also called the 'Mokshadayini city'. The name of this river is taken among the holy rivers like Kaveri, Narmada, [[Godavari River|Godavari]] and Krishna.

According to [[Hermann Kulke]] and [[Dietmar Rothermund]], [[Avanti (India)|Avanti]], whose capital was Ujjain, "was one of the earliest outposts in central India" and showed signs of early incipient urbanisation around 700 BCE.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of India |first1=Hermann |last1=Kulke |first2=Dietmar |last2=Rothermund |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-41532-920-0 |author-link1=Hermann Kulke |author-link2=Dietmar Rothermund |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RoW9GuFJ9GIC&pg=PA50 |pages=50–51}}</ref> Around 600 BCE, Ujjain emerged as the political, Commercial, and cultural centre of [[Malwa]] plateau.<ref name="Trudy_2012">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=voerPYsAB5wC&pg=PA835 |title=Asia and Oceania: International Dictionary of Historic Places |pages=835–837 |editor1=Trudy Ring |editor2=Noelle Watson |editor3=Paul Schellinger |publisher=Routledge |year=2012 |isbn=9781136639791 }}</ref>

The ancient walled city of Ujjain was located around the Garh Kalika hill on the bank of the river Kshipra, in the present-day suburban areas of the Ujjain city. This city covered an irregular pentagonal area of 0.875&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. It was surrounded by a 12 m high mud [[rampart (fortification)|rampart]].

From the Mauryan period, [[Northern Black Polished Ware]], copper coins, [[terracotta]] ring wells, and ivory seals with [[Brahmi script|Brahmi]] text have been excavated at Ujjain.<ref name="FRA_GE_1995"/> Ujjain emerged as an important commercial centre, partially because it lay on the trade route connecting north India to the Deccan, starting from Mathura. It also emerged as an important center for intellectual learning among [[Jain]],  Buddhist, and Hindu traditions.<ref name="Trudy_2012"/>

In the Post-Mauryan period, the [[Sungas]] and the [[Satavahanas]] ruled the city consecutively. The Satavahanas and the [[Ror]] [[Sakas]], known as [[Western Satraps]], contested for control of the city for a period. Following the end of the Satavahana dynasty, the Rors retained Ujjain from the second to the twelfth century C.E.<ref>{{cite web

Ujjain remained as an important city of the Guptas during the 4th and the 5th centuries.

=== Medieval period ===
[[File:Vedh Shala, Ujjain 01.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Jantar Mantar]] at Ujjain was commissioned by [[Jai Singh II]] (1688-1743) of Jaipur.]]

The [[Paramara dynasty|Paramaras]] (9th-14th century CE) built the City of Ujjain and shifted the region's capital from Ujjain to [[Dhar]].<ref name="Trudy_2012"/> [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] sacked the city and forced it to pay tribute during his invasion in India.

As late as the time of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] vassal [[Jai Singh II]] (1688-1743), who constructed a [[Ved Shala|Jantar Mantar]] in the city, Ujjain was the largest city and capital of the [[Malwa Subah]]. The city continued to be developed during Muslim rule, especially under the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and the [[Mughal Empire]]. It was used as an important military headquarters.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QRA2mgZnXXMC&pg=PA212 |title=Sawai Jai Singh and His Astronomy |author=Virendra Nath Sharma |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |year=1995 |page=212 |isbn=9788120812567 }}</ref>

==Industry==
Major industrial areas surrounding Ujjain are '[[Dewas]] Road Industrial Area', 'Maxi Road Industrial Area' Vikram Udhogpuri, and 'Tajpur Industrial Area'.<ref>{{Cite web|title=InvestMP - MPIDC|url=https://invest.mp.gov.in/|website=[[MPIDC]]}}</ref>

[[Indore]] and [[Dewas]] are the cities where majority of the industries are present. Both Indore and Dewas are in close proximity to Ujjain, providing employment to people in Ujjain and nearby areas.

The [[Government of Madhya Pradesh]] has allotted 1,200 acres for the development of an industrial area on the Dewas-Ujjain Road (MP State Highway 18) near Narwar village. Originally named "Vikramaditya Knowledge City", the area was envisaged as an educational hub. Due to diminished investment prospects, it was renamed to "[[Vikram Udyog Nagari]]" ("Vikram Industrial City"). As of 2014, the government has conceptualized it as a half-industrial, half-educational area. The stakeholders in the project include the state government and the [[Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor]] (DMIC) Trust.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/ujjain-s-knowledge-city-renamed-vikram-udyog-nagari-114050500951_1.html|title=Ujjain's 'Knowledge City' renamed 'Vikram Udyog Nagari'}}</ref>

==Transportation==

===Airport===
Ujjain does not have any airport but has an [[Ujjain Airstrip|airstrip]] on Dewas road which is used for air transport purposes. In 2013, the [[Government of Madhya Pradesh]] started a Ujjain-Bhopal air services as a joint venture with [[Ventura AirConnect]]. Due to very low booking, the ambitious project was scrapped. The main reason for the failure of the plan was due to improper timing of flights. <!-- (I'm commenting this out because it's missing a verb that would make it make sense. Adjacent ref is a dead link. Was the aircraft put into service, or not put into service? If you can clarify, please reinstate. Thanks!) The nine seating capacity aircraft was into service. -->The nearest airport is the [[Devi Ahilyabai Holkar International Airport]] at [[Indore]] (57&nbsp;km).
