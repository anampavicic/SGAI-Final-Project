Tyre juts out from the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and is located about {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Beirut]]. It originally consisted of two distinct urban centres: Tyre itself, which was on an island just 500 to 700m offshore, and the associated settlement of [[Ushu]] on the adjacent mainland, later called ''Palaetyrus'', meaning "Old Tyre" in [[Ancient Greek]].<ref>Presutta, David. ''The Biblical Cosmos Versus Modern Cosmology''. 2007, page 225, referencing: Katzenstein, H.J., ''The History of Tyre'', 1973, p.9</ref> The fortified city was on top of a rock from which its name was inherited as "''S‚Äòr''" is the Phoenician word for "rock". It had two ports, the "Sidonian port" to the north, still partly existing today, and the "Egyptian port" to the south which has perhaps been discovered very recently.<ref>Goiran, J-P, et al., 2023, "Evolution of Sea Level at Tyre During Antiquity", BAAL 21, with a new hypothesis about the local relative sea level rise and a major discovery of the Phoenician breakwater of the southern, so-called "Egyptian", harbour  [https://www.academia.edu/104492325]</ref>

[[File:OffTyreRockyIslands RomanDeckert04102019.jpg|thumb|Rocky islets off Tyre]]
Throughout history from [[Prehistory|prehistoric times]] onwards, all settlements in the Tyre area profited from the abundance of [[fresh water]] supplies, especially from the nearby [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] of Rashidieh and [[Ras al-Ain, Lebanon|Ras Al Ain]] in the South. In addition, there are the springs of Al Bagbog and Ain Ebreen in the North as well as the [[Litani River]], also known as Alqasymieh.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Badawi|first=Ali Khalil|title=TYRE|publisher=Al-Athar Magazine|year=2018|edition=4th|location=Beirut|pages=5, 7}}</ref> The present city of Tyre covers a large part of the original island and has expanded onto and covers most of the [[causeway]] built by [[Alexander the Great]] in 332 [[Common Era|BCE]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |author1=Heather Whipps |date=2007-05-14 |title=Mystery Solved: How Alexander the Great Defeated Tyre |url=https://www.livescience.com/1523-mystery-solved-alexander-great-defeated-tyre.html |access-date=2024-05-28 |website=livescience.com |language=en}}</ref> This [[isthmus]] increased greatly in width over the centuries because of extensive silt depositions on either side.

Four municipalities contribute to Tyre city's 16.7&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> built-up area, though none are included in their entirety: Sour municipality contains the heart of the city, excluding the Natural and Coastal Reserve; Burj El Shimali to the East without unpopulated agricultural lands; Abbasiyet Sour to the North without agricultural lands and a dislocated village; and [[Ain Baal]] to the South-East, also without agricultural lands and dislocated villages. Tyre's urban area lies on a fertile coastal plain, which explains the fact that as of 2017 about 44% of its territory was used for intra-urban agriculture, while built-up land constituted over 40%.<ref name="Maguire-2016" />

In terms of [[geomorphology]] and [[seismicity]], Tyre is close to the Roum Fault and the [[Yammoune]]h [[Fault (geology)|Fault]]. Though it has suffered a number of devastating earthquakes over the [[Millennium|millennia]], the threat level is considered to be low in most places and moderate in a few others. However, a [[tsunami]] following an earthquake and subsequent [[landslide]]s and floods pose major natural risks to the Tyrian population.<ref name="Maguire-2016" />

Vast reserves of natural gas are estimated to lie beneath Lebanese waters, much of it off Tyre's coast, but [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]] has been delayed by [[Territorial dispute|border disputes]] with Israel.<ref name="UN OCHA-2013">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/analysis/2013/02/15/ten-ways-develop-southern-lebanon|title=Ten ways to develop southern Lebanon|date=15 February 2013|website=The New Humanitarian|access-date=4 December 2019}}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of Tyre, Lebanon}}

The ancient city of Tyre is located along the coast of [[Phoenicia]] in modern Lebanon. The site has been occupied since the [[Bronze Age]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-10-17 |title=A History of the Ancient & Classical City of Tyre and Its Commerce |url=https://www.thecollector.com/history-of-ancient-classical-city-of-tyre/ |access-date=2024-05-28 |website=TheCollector |language=en}}</ref> The city became a prominent Phoenician city-state between the 9th and 6th centuries BCE, settling prestigious colonies around the Mediterranean Sea, such as [[Carthage]] and [[Leptis Magna]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-04-23 |title=Tyre {{!}} Ancient City & Historical Site {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Tyre |access-date=2024-05-28 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> It went under Persian rule in 572 BCE, before being conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] in 332 BCE. Monumental archaeological remains dated from the subsequent [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], and [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] periods led to its inscription on its archaeological remains on the [[UNESCO]] World‚Äôs Heritage list in 1984.<br>

The Roman historian [[Justin (historian)|Justin]] wrote that the original founders arrived from the nearby city of [[Sidon]] in the quest to establish a new harbour. The famous Greek historian [[Herodotus]] (c. 484‚Äì425 BCE), born in the city of [[Halicarnassus]], visited Tyre around 450 BCE at the end of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] (499‚Äì449 BCE), and wrote in his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' that according to the priests there, the city was founded 2300 years earlier (around 2750 BCE),<ref>{{cite book |last1=Herodotus |title=Histories, Book 2 |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_History_of_Herodotus_(Rawlinson)/Book_2 }} [https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/ŒôœÉœÑŒøœÅŒØŒ±Œπ_(ŒóœÅŒøŒ¥œåœÑŒøœÖ)/ŒïœÖœÑŒ≠œÅœÄŒ∑ Greek original]</ref> as a walled place upon the mainland, now known as ''Paleotyre'' (Old Tyre). <br>

The Phoenician Tyrians' international trade network was based on its two harbours which are mentioned by ancient writers (Arrian, Anabasis, 2, 24; Strabo, Geography, 16,2,23).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Arrian, Anabasis, book 2, chapter 24, section 1 |url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:2008.01.0530:book=2:chapter=24:section=1 |access-date=2024-05-28 |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Strabo, Geography, BOOK XVI., CHAPTER II., section 23 |url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0239:book=16:chapter=2:section=23 |access-date=2024-05-28 |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref> The northern harbour opened toward the Phoenician city of [[Sidon]] and has been therefore referred to as the ‚ÄúSidonian Harbour‚Äù by 19th and 20th century scholars, but it was referred to as the "Port of Astronoe" during Late Antiquity.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Aliquot |first=Julien |date=2020 |title=The Port of Astronoe in Tyre |url=https://shs.hal.science/halshs-03835979 |journal=Bulletin d'Arch√©ologie et d'Architecture Libanaises |volume=Hors- S√©rie 18 |pages=61‚Äì70 |via=HAL}}</ref> The southern harbour opened toward [[Egypt]] and was referred to as the ‚ÄúEgyptian Harbour‚Äù. The location of the two harbours has been the subject of speculations since the 17th Century.<ref>Renan, E., 1864-1874. Mission de Ph√©nicie dirig√©e par Ernest Renan: Texte. Impr. imp√©riale.</ref> The submarine excavation of a large, 4-6th Century BCE breakwater north of the city,<ref>Castellvi, G., Descamps, C., Kuteni, V.P., 2007.

Geoscience rediscovers Phoenicia's buried harbors. Geology 34, 1-4.</ref> demonstrated the existence of a northern harbour repeatedly, if not permanently, throughout Antiquity under the modern harbour of Tyre. <br>

The location of the southern harbour is more elusive. Renan (1864‚Äì1874) envisioned it as an extensive structure now located offshore, south of the former island. Subsequent diving surveys identified submerged man-made structures on the seafloor within 150 m of the former island.<ref>El-Amouri, M., El-H√©lou, M., Marquet, M., Noureddine, I., Seco Alvarez, M., 2005.

Bulletin du Mus√©e de Beyrouth 24, 103-111.</ref> Antoine Poidebard, who was the first to have them explored by divers in 1939, saw in these structures former breakwaters enclosing a harbour with two entrances.<ref>Poidebard, A., 1939. Un grand port disparu: Tyr: recherches a√©riennes et sous-marines: 1934-1936. P. Geuthner.</ref> The geographic area enclosed within these structures is therefore often referred to as the ‚ÄúSouthern Harbour‚Äù. These structures have also been interpreted as a polder-like area protecting an urban district (El-Amouri et al., 2005; Frost, 1971; Renan, 1864‚Äì1874). A Phoenician-style breakwater was recently found within this area, but excavation is needed to confirm its age ascription.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Goiran |first1=Jean-Philippe |last2=Brocard |first2=Gilles |last3=De Graauw |first3=Arthur |last4=Kahwagi-Janho |first4=Hany |last5=Chapkanski |first5=Stoil |date=2021 |title=Evolution of sea level at Tyre during Antiquity |journal=Bulletin d'Arch√©ologie et d'Architecture Libanaise |volume=21 |pages=305‚Äì316}}</ref> Harbour sediments found behind the structure suggest that the breakwater was part of the Egyptian harbour.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last1=Brocard |first1=Gilles |last2=Goiran |first2=Jean-Philippe |last3=de Graauw |first3=Arthur |last4=Chapkanski |first4=Stoil |last5=Dapoigny |first5=Arnaud |last6=R√©gagnon |first6=Emmanuelle |last7=Husson |first7=Xavier |last8=Bolo |first8=Aur√©lien |last9=Pavlopoulos |first9=Kosmas |last10=Fouache |first10=Eric |last11=Badawi |first11=Ali |last12=Yon |first12=Jean-Baptiste |date=2024-01-15 |title=Growth of the sandy isthmus of tyre and ensuing relocation of its harbors |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379123005115 |journal=Quaternary Science Reviews |volume=324 |pages=108463 |doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2023.108463 |bibcode=2024QSRv..32408463B |s2cid=266282297 |issn=0277-3791}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://archeorient.hypotheses.org/26907 | title=Where is the Phoenician harbour of Tyre? | date=26 January 2024 | doi=10.58079/vom2 | last1=Arthur de Graauw, Gilles Brocard et Jean-Philippe Goiran. }}</ref> Harbour sediments found near Hiram's Tower, further north, mark an early location of the Sidonian Harbour.<ref name=":0" /> <br>

The development of Tyre was profoundly affected by the construction of a [[causeway]] built by [[Alexander the Great]] in 332 BCE to seize the city.<ref name=":1" /> This reportedly 750 m-long<ref>four stades acc. to Diodorus Siculus, Hist, 17, 7 and to Quintus Curtius Rufus, Hist, 4, 2, but 700 paces acc. to Pliny, Natural History V, 17</ref> and 60 m-wide causeway was laid over a submarine [[shoal]] less than 5.4 m deep.<ref>three fathoms acc. to Arrian, Anabasis, 2, 18</ref> This shoal was interpreted as a sandbank (also called a ‚Äòsalient‚Äô), formed by the accretion of sand in the lee of the island, under the effects of the refraction and diffraction of waves around the island. The causeway interrupted longshore sand transport, forcing sand to accumulate along the causeway, rapidly creating an emerged sandy isthmus (or [[tombolo]]), linking the island to the mainland.<ref>Marriner, N., Goiran, J., Morhange, C., 2008. Alexander the Great's tombolos at Tyre and Alexandria, eastern Mediterranean. Geomorphology 100, 377-400.</ref><ref>Nir, Y., 1996. The city of Tyre, Lebanon and its semi‚Äêartificial tombolo. Geoarchaeology 11, 235-250.</ref>

This sandy isthmus rapidly inflated during the centuries following the construction of the causeway. By early Imperial Roman times, monumental buildings had been built over most of its surface. Their layout implies that the isthmus was by then nearly as wide as today. Therefore, the isthmus had completely reshaped the eastern coast of Tyre Island within 6&ndash;10 centuries after the construction of the causeway, spurring a radical transformation of the city.{{fact|date=September 2024}}

Due to its diverse [[flora]] and [[fauna]], the reserve was designated a [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar Site]] in 1999 according to the international [[treaty]] for the conservation and sustainable use of [[Wetland]]s, since it is considered "the last [[Biogeography|bio-geographic]] [[ecosystem]] in Lebanon". It is an important nesting site for [[Bird migration|migratory birds]], the endangered [[Loggerhead sea turtle|Loggerhead]] and [[green sea turtle]], the [[Arabian spiny mouse]] and many other creatures (including [[Lacertidae|wall lizards]], [[common pipistrelle]], and [[European badger]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Protecting marine biodiversity in Lebanon|url=https://www.iucn.org/about/union/secretariat/offices/iucnmed/iucn_med_programme/?9741/Protecting-marine-biodiversity-in-Lebanon|publisher=[[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN)|date=2 May 2012|access-date=17 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811180131/http://www.iucn.org/about/union/secretariat/offices/iucnmed/iucn_med_programme/?9741%2FProtecting-marine-biodiversity-in-Lebanon|archive-date=11 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Hany El Shaer |author2=Ms. Lara Samaha |author3=Ghassan Jaradi |title=Lebanon's Marine Protected Area Strategy|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/efiles/documents/2012-081.pdf|publisher=Lebanese Ministry of Environment|date=December 2012}}</ref> Also, there are frequent sighting of dolphins in the waters off Tyre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.the961.com/news/a-giant-dolphin-was-just-found-stuck-between-rocks-on-tyre-shore|title=A Giant Dolphin Was Just Found Stuck Between Rocks on Tyre Shore|last=Kabboul|first=Tamarah|date=October 2019|website=The961|access-date=28 October 2019|archive-date=28 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191028071719/https://www.the961.com/news/a-giant-dolphin-was-just-found-stuck-between-rocks-on-tyre-shore|url-status=dead}}</ref> Altogether, the TCNR includes:

<blockquote>275 [[species]] distributed over 50 families. In addition, the reserve is home to seven regionally and nationally [[threatened species]], 4 [[Endemism|endemic]] and 10 [[rare species]], whilst 59 species are restricted to the Eastern Mediterranean area. It is also worthy to indicate that, several [[Bioindicator|bio-indicator]] species as well as 25 [[Medicinal plants|medicinal]] species were recognized. TCNR encloses flora species belonging to the various habitats: the sandy shore, rocky shore, [[Littoral zone|littoral]] and [[Freshwater ecosystem]]s. A wide number of [[Poaceae|Gramineae]], [[Fabaceae]], [[Asteraceae]] and [[Apiaceae|Umbellifereae]] families dominate the floristic resources.<ref name="Yacoub-2011" /></blockquote>

However, the biodiversity of the TCNR is threatened as shown by a strong decrease in the numbers of the caspian [[terrapin]] ''[[Caspian turtle|Mauremys caspica]]'', the green [[toad]] ''[[European green toad|Bufo viridis]]'' and the [[tree frog]] ''[[Hyla savignyi|Hyla savigny]]''. Also, since the 2000s, the North American camphorweed ''[[Heterotheca subaxillaris]]'' has invaded the TCNR as a [[Neophyte (botany)|neophyte]] from Haifa across the Blue Line.<ref name="Yacoub-2011" />

Large-scale excavations started in 1946 under the leadership of [[Emir]] [[Maurice Chehab|Maurice Ch√©hab]] (1904‚Äì1994), "the father of modern Lebanese archaeology" who for decades headed the Antiquities Service in Lebanon and was the curator of the [[National Museum of Beirut]].

During the 1960s, [[Honor Frost]] (1917‚Äì2010) ‚Äì the [[Cyprus]]-born pioneer of [[underwater archaeology]] initiated several investigations "aimed at identifying and documenting the significant archaeological potential for harbour facilities within coastal Tyre".

In the late 1980s, "clandestine excavations" took place in the [[Tyre Necropolis |Al-Bass cemetery]], which "flooded the antiquities market".<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Abousamra|first1=Gaby|last2=Lemaire|first2=Andr√©|year=2013|title=Astarte in Tyre According to New Iron Age Funerary Stelae|journal=Die Welt des Orients|publisher=Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht (GmbH & Co.

=== Biblical description ===
[[File:John Martin - Destruction of Tyre - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|The prophesied destruction of Tyre as painted by [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]].]]

The city of Tyre appears in many biblical traditions:

==== Hebrew Bible / Old Testament ====
* According to Joshua 19, "the fortified city of Tyre" was allotted to the [[Tribe of Asher]].<ref>{{bibleverse|Joshua|19:29|}}</ref>
* [[King Hiram I]] of Tyre allied himself with [[King David|David]] and [[King Solomon|Solomon]] in 2 Samuel, 1 Kings and 1 Chronicles.<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|5:11|KJV|}}, {{bibleverse|1|Kings|5:1|KJV|}}, and {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|14:1|KJV|}}</ref> Hiram provided architects, workmen, [[Cedar of Lebanon|cedar wood]], and gold to build the royal palace in [[Jerusalem]], as well as the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dever|2005|p=97}}; {{harvnb|Mendels|1987|p=131}}; {{harvnb|Brand|Mitchell|2015|p=1538}}</ref>
*Tyre is listed among an alliance of ten nations that would conspire against God's people.<ref>{{Bibleref2|Psalm|83:3-8}}</ref> 
* Tyre is mentioned in the [[Book of Isaiah]] as being forgotten for 70 years when her "fortress is destroyed" and after which "her profit and her prostitute's wages will be sacred to the Lord."<ref>{{Bibleref2|Isaiah|23}}</ref>
*The [[Book of Joel]] groups Tyre, [[Sidon]] and [[Philistia]] together and it states that the people of [[Judah (son of Jacob)|Judah]] and Jerusalem were sold to the Greeks, and there would thus be punishment because of it.<ref>{{Bibleref2|Joel|3:4‚Äì8}}</ref>
*Tyre is also mentioned in the [[Book of Ezekiel]],<ref>{{Bibleref2|Ezekiel|26-28}}</ref> [[Book of Amos]],<ref>{{Bibleref2|Amos|1:9‚Äì10}}</ref> the [[Psalms]], and the [[Book of Zechariah]]<ref>{{Bibleref2|Zechariah|9:3‚Äì4}}</ref> which [[Prophecy|prophesied]] its destruction.

==== New Testament ====
* [[Jesus]] visited the region or "coasts" ([[King James Version]]) of Tyre and [[Sidon]]<ref name="ReferenceA">{{bibleref|Matthew|15:21}}; {{bibleref|Mark|7:24}}</ref> and from this region many came forth to hear him preaching,<ref>Mark 3:8; Luke 6:17</ref> leading to the stark contrast in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 11:21<ref>{{bibleref|Matthew|11:21‚Äì23}}</ref> to his reception in [[Korazin]] and [[Bethsaida]].
*[[Herod the Great|Herod]] was said to be angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon and he delivered a public address upon which he was struck down by God after not giving glory to him once he received praise arrogantly according to the [[Acts of the Apostles|Book of Acts]].<ref>{{Bibleref2|Acts|12:19‚Äì24}}</ref> The same book describes Paul's voyage to Tyre where he stayed for seven days.<ref>{{Bibleref2|Acts|21:1‚Äì7}}</ref>
* In the [[Book of Revelation]],<ref>{{bibleverse||Revelation|18|KJV}}</ref> chapter 18 alludes extensively to the mercantile description of Tyre in Ezekiel 26‚Äì28.

=== Other writings ===
* ''[[Apollonius of Tyre]]'' is the subject of an ancient short novella, popular in the Middle Ages. Existing in numerous forms in many languages, the text is thought to be translated from an ancient Greek manuscript, now lost.
* ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'' is a [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] play written at least in part by [[William Shakespeare]] and [[George Wilkins]]. It is included in modern editions of his collected works despite questions over its authorship.
* In 19th-century Britain, Tyre was several times taken as an [[wikt:exemplar|exemplar]] of the mortality of great power and status, for example by [[John Ruskin]] in the opening lines of ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|''The Stones of Venice'']]'' and by [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s [[Recessional (poem)|Recessional]].
* Tyrus is the title and subject of a poem by the [[Lake District|Cumbrian]] poet [[Norman Nicholson]] in his collection 'Rock Face' of 1948.
* The French [[comic book artist]] [[Albert Uderzo]] published in 1981 ''[[Asterix and the Black Gold]]'' which describes [[Asterix]]'s and [[Obelix]]'s voyage to the Middle East featuring [[James Bond]] and biblical themes: in their quest for petroleum, they sail on board a Phoenician ship, but the Roman regime closes off the ports of Tyre in order to deny their landing.
* In 2015, the [[French people in Lebanon|French Lebanese]] artist Joseph Safieddine published the [[graphic novel]] drama ''Yallah Bye'' which offers an account of his family's fate during the 2006 war between Israel and [[Hezbollah]], when they sought refuge in the Christian quarter of Tyre. An English version followed in 2017 and an Arabic one in 2019.

It is a very large [[Asteroid belt|main-belt]] [[asteroid]], classified as a [[C-type asteroid]] which is probably composed of [[Carbonate|carbonaceous]] materials. 209 Dido was discovered in 1879 by [[Christian Heinrich Friedrich Peters|C.

In 1959, the "Cinema Rivoli of Tyre" opened and quickly became one of the prime movie theatres of the country.

Meanwhile, two Tyrian artists had a major impact on the development of Lebanese music: [[Halim el-Roumi]] (1919‚Äì1983) and Ghazi Kahwaji (1945‚Äì2017). Some sources claim that the famous musician, composer, singer and actor el-Roumi was born in Tyre to Lebanese parents.

By then, cultural life in Tyre had been severely affected by armed conflict as well. In 1975, the commercial "Festivals de Tyr" ‚Äì organised by Maha al-Khalil Chalabi, the daughter of feudal landlord and politician Kazem al-Khalil ‚Äì were supposed to debut but stopped at the outbreak of the Civil War.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Henoud|first=Carla|date=6 July 2002|title=Femmes...Maha el-Khalil Chalabi, un combat incessant pour Tyr|url=https://www.lorientlejour.com/article/379690/Femmes...Maha_el-Khalil_Chalabi%252C_un_combat_incessant_pour_Tyr%2528PHOTO%2529.html|access-date=20 November 2020|website=L'Orient - Le Jour|language=fr}}</ref>

In the mid-nineties though, first the idea of a commercial Tyre International Festival was revived. It has been organised since then annually in the ancient site of the Roman hippodrome, featuring international artists like [[Elton John]] and [[Sarah Brightman]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lebanon: The Official Guide|publisher=Paravision S.A.L. / Ministry of Tourism|year=n.d.|isbn=978-9953002880|pages=119}}</ref> as well as Lebanese stars [[Wadih El Safi]], [[Demis Roussos]], [[Kadim Al-Saher]], [[Melhem Barakat]], [[Julia Boutros]], and [[Majida El Roumi]],<ref name="Badawi-2008" /> the daughter of Halim el-Roumi.

In 2006, the "Centre de Lecture et d‚ÄôAnimation Culturelle" (C.L.A.C.) was opened by Tyre's municipality as the first public library of the city, with support from the Lebanese Ministry of Culture and the French Embassy in Beirut.

There are many [https://www.aust.edu.lb/ universities in Lebanon]. 

The Jafariya School was founded in 1938 by Imam Abdul Hussein Sharafeddin.<ref>{{Cite thesis|url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/1521/|title=Political awareness of the Shi'ites in Lebanon: the role of Sayyid 'Abd al-Husain Sharaf al-Din and Sayyid Musa al-Sadr|last=Gharbieh|first=Hussein M.|publisher=Centre for Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies, University of Durham|year=1996|location=Durham|format=PDF|type=Doctoral}}</ref> It soon expanded thanks mainly to donations from rich √©migr√©s and thus was upgraded in 1946 to be a Secondary School, the first in Southern Lebanon (see above).

An important role in the Tyrian education landscape is played by the charity organisation of the vanished Imam [[Musa al-Sadr]], which has been headed since his disappearance in 1978 by his sister [[Rabab al-Sadr]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Norton|first=Augustus Richard|title=Hezbollah: A Short History|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0691160818|location=Princeton and Oxford|pages=109}}</ref> While the foundation operates in various parts of the country, its main base is a compound on the southern entry of the Tyre peninsula close to the sea.

Musa Sadr also laid the groundwork for establishing the Islamic University of Lebanon (IUL) which was finally licensed in 1996 and opened a branch on the seafront,in Tyre. Its board of trustees is dominated by representatives of the Supreme Shiite Council, founded by Sadr in 1967.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iul.edu.lb/page/?id=309|title=The vision of the University|date=n.d.|website=Islamic University of Lebanon|access-date=29 February 2020|archive-date=19 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200219130048/http://www.iul.edu.lb/page/?id=309|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Lebanese Evangelical School in Tyre with a history of more than 150 years is arguably the largest school in town. [[Coll√®ge √âlite (Tyre)|Coll√®ge √âlite]], a French international school opened in 1996, is another one of a host of private schools in Tyre.

Tyre is known as "Little West [[Africa]]". Many families in Tyre have relatives in the Western Africa diaspora, especially in [[Senegal]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Ivory Coast]] and [[Nigeria]]. In Senegal, most immigrants originated from Tyre. Member of the Tyrian communities there are "primarily second, third and fourt generation migrants, many of whom have never been to Lebanon."

Tyre houses one of the nation's major ports, though much smaller than the ports of Beirut, Tripoli, and also Sidon/Saida. Its cargo traffic has been limited to the periodical import of used cars. One day after the [[2020 Beirut explosion]] which devastated the [[Port of Beirut]] and much of the national capital on 4 August the national government reportedly decided to use the Port of Tyre as a back-up for the Port of Tripoli.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Akleh|first=Tony|date=6 August 2020|title=Beirut port: irreplaceable importance in the middle of Lebanon's geography|work=Arabian Business|url=https://www.arabianbusiness.com/politics-economics/450512-beirut-port-irreplaceable-importance-in-the-middle-of-lebanons-geography|access-date=6 August 2020}}</ref>

In the harbour area, the Barbour family of shipbuilders continues to build wooden boats.<ref>{{Cite book|title=lebanon ‚Äì THROUGH THE LENS OF MUNIR NASR|last=Zoghaib|first=Henri|publisher=Arab Printing Press sal|year=2004|isbn=9789953023854|location=Beirut|pages=74}}</ref> Tyre is thus one of only a few cities in the Mediterranean that has kept this ancient tradition, although the Barbour business has been struggling to survive as well. By 2004, there were "over 600 fishermen [..] striving to make ends meet in Tyre alone".<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2004/Sep-13/2997-wooden-boat-makers-in-tyre-struggle-to-survive.ashx|title=Wooden-boat makers in Tyre struggle to survive|last=El-Ghoul|first=Adnan|date=13 September 2004|journal=The Daily Star|access-date=24 December 2019|archive-date=24 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191224094642/http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2004/Sep-13/2997-wooden-boat-makers-in-tyre-struggle-to-survive.ashx|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Lebanon's General Directorate of Land Registry and Cadastre (GDLRC) recorded for Tyre a 4.4 percent growth rate for land transactions between 2014 and 2018, the highest rate in the country during that period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessnews.com.lb/cms/Story/StoryDetails/6929/Tyre,-Hasbaya,-Marjayoun-are-top-property-destinations|title=Tyre, Hasbaya, Marjayoun are top property destinations|last=Alieh|first=Yassmine|date=6 February 2019|website=BusinessNews.com.lb|access-date=5 November 2019}}</ref> This increase in real estate prices has been largely attributed to the inflow of remittances from diaspora Tyrians.<ref name="Maguire-2016" />

Off the Tyrian coast, block 9 has been awarded for [[deepwater drilling]] of natural gas to a consortium of French company [[TotalEnergies]], Italy-based [[Eni]], and Russian [[Novatek]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.petroleum-economist.com/articles/upstream/exploration-production/2019/lebanon-s-gas-hopes-threatened-by-corruption|title=Lebanon's gas hopes threatened by corruption|last=Butt|first=Gerald|date=28 October 2019|website=PETROLEUM ECONOMIST|access-date=2 March 2020}}</ref>

[[File:TadamonTyreMunicipalStadium RomanDeckert20092019.jpg|thumb|The faded sign of Tadamon SC on the roof of the Municipal Stadium]]
[[Tadamon Sour SC|Tadamon Sour Sporting Club]], or simply Tadamon (meaning "Solidarity"), nicknamed "The Ambassador of the South", was founded in 1946 and is thus the historically most established [[Football team|football club]] of Tyre. They play their home matches at the [[Sour Stadium|Tyre Municipal Stadium]] and have won one [[Lebanese FA Cup]] (2000‚Äì01) and two [[Lebanese Challenge Cup]]s (2013 and 2018). Tadamon's traditional rivals, [[Salam Sour SC|Salam Sour Sports Club]], are also based in Tyre.{{fact|date=September 2024}}

According to BBC reports, Tadamon SC was stripped of its [[Lebanese Premier League]] championship title in 2001 following [[Match fixing in association football|match-fixing]] allegations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1429258.stm|title=Fifa suspends Lebanese FA|date=8 July 2001|work=BBC Sport|access-date=5 February 2020}}</ref>

In the same year the club scored arguably one of its biggest transfers when [[Roda Antar]] from its own youth teams was loaned to Germany's [[Hamburger SV]] for two seasons. After eight years in Germany with Hamburg, [[SC Freiburg]] and [[1. FC K√∂ln]] he played another six years in the [[Chinese Super League]] and then returned to Tadamon for one final season before retirement.{{fact|date=September 2024}}

A number of Lebanese Premier League professional [[Football player|footballers]], who have also played for the [[Lebanon national football team|Lebanon national team]], originate from Tyre, namely [[Rabih Ataya]],<ref name="GSA-2022a">{{Cite web|url=https://globalsportsarchive.com/people/soccer/rabih-ataya/65007/|title=Rabih Ataya ‚Äì Player Info|website=Global Sports Archive|access-date=1 February 2020}}</ref> and [[Nassar Nassar]].<ref name="GSA-2022b">{{Cite web|url=https://globalsportsarchive.com/people/soccer/nassar-nassar/148752/|title=Nassar Nassar ‚Äì Player Info|website=Global Sports Archive|access-date=1 February 2020}}</ref>
