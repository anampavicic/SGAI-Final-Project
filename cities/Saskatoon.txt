'''Saskatoon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|æ|s|k|ə|ˈ|t|uː|n}}) is the largest city in the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Saskatchewan]]. It straddles a bend in the [[South Saskatchewan River]] in the central region of the province. It is located along the [[Trans-Canada Highway|Trans-Canada]] [[Yellowhead Highway]], and has served as the cultural and economic hub of central Saskatchewan since its founding in 1882 as a [[Temperance movement|Temperance]] colony.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.saskatoon.ca/community-culture-heritage/saskatoon-history-archives/history |title=History |publisher=City of Saskatoon |access-date=2016-06-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415123817/https://www.saskatoon.ca/community-culture-heritage/saskatoon-history-archives/history |archive-date=April 15, 2016 |url-status=live |date=December 15, 2014 }}</ref>

With a [[Canada 2021 Census|2021 census population]] of 266,141, Saskatoon is the [[List of cities in Saskatchewan|largest city in the province]], and the [[List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada|17th largest Census Metropolitan Area in Canada]], with a 2021 census population of 317,480. <ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-04-27 |title=Saskatoon remains largest city in Saskatchewan: census |url=https://saskatoon.ctvnews.ca/saskatoon-remains-largest-city-in-saskatchewan-census-1.5878356 |access-date=2024-08-23 |website=Saskatoon |language=en}}</ref>

Saskatoon is home to the [[University of Saskatchewan]], the [[Meewasin Valley Authority]]—which protects the South Saskatchewan River and provides for the city's popular riverbank park spaces—and [[Wanuskewin Heritage Park]], a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] and [[UNESCO]] World Heritage applicant representing 6,000 years of [[First Nations in Canada|First Nations]] history. The [[Corman Park No. 344, Saskatchewan|Rural Municipality of Corman Park No. 344]], the most populous [[List of rural municipalities in Saskatchewan|rural municipality]] in Saskatchewan, surrounds the city and contains many of the developments associated with it, including Wanuskewin. Saskatoon is named after the [[Amelanchier alnifolia|saskatoon berry]], which is native to the [[Canadian Cordillera|region]] and is itself derived from the [[Cree language|Cree]] ''{{lang|cr|misâskwatômina}}''. The city has a significant [[First Nations in Canada|Indigenous]] population and several urban [[Indian reserve|Reserves]]. The city has nine river crossings and is [[list of city nicknames and slogans in Canada#Saskatchewan|nicknamed]] "Paris of the Prairies" and "Bridge City".

Historic neighbourhoods of Saskatoon include [[Nutana]] and [[Riversdale, Saskatoon|Riversdale]], which were separate towns before amalgamating with the town of Saskatoon and incorporating as a city in 1906. Nutana, Riversdale, their historic main streets of [[Broadway Avenue (Saskatoon)|Broadway Avenue]] and [[Riversdale, Saskatoon#Commercial|20th Street]], as well as the [[Central Business District, Saskatoon|downtown core]] and other central neighbourhoods are seeing significant reinvestment and redevelopment. [[Sutherland, Saskatoon|Sutherland]] was a rail town beyond the [[University of Saskatchewan]] lands, annexed by the city in 1956.

==Etymology==
The name ''Saskatoon'' (in {{langx|cr|sâskwatôn}} {{lang|cr|ᓵᐢᑿᑑᐣ}}, "Saskatoon" or the [[locative]]s: ''misâskwatôminihk'' {{lang|cr|ᒥᓵᐢᑿᑑᒥᓂᕽ}}, lit: "at the saskatoon berry", ''misâskwatôminiskâhk'' {{lang|cr|ᒥᓵᐢᑿᑑᒥᓂᐢᑳᕽ}}, "at the place of many saskatoon berries", ''mînisihk'' {{lang|cr|ᒦᓂᓯᕽ}} "at the berry") comes from the Cree inanimate noun ''misâskwatômina'' {{lang|cr|ᒥᓵᐢᑿᑑᒥᓇ}} "[[saskatoon berry|saskatoon berries]]", which refers to the sweet, violet-coloured [[Amelanchier alnifolia|serviceberry]] that grows in the area.<ref name="eb">{{cite web |author1=Adam Augustyn |title=Saskatoon |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Saskatoon-Saskatchewan |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=12 September 2021 |date=2021}}</ref> However, the exact origin of the naming of the settlement is unclear. Founder [[John Neilson Lake|John Lake]] apparently told multiple stories, including the most famous, where in August, 1883 he was handed a handful of berries, told their name, and exclaimed, "Arise Saskatoon Queen of the North!" It is considered most likely that the name in fact derived from one already in use: ''manemesaskwatan'', or "the place where willows are cut," referring to the Cree practice of cutting saskatoon berry willows for arrow shafts.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kerr |first=Donald C. |title=Saskatoon, the First Half-century |publisher=NeWest |year=1982 |isbn=9780920316375 |location=Edmonton |pages=4–5 |language=en}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main article|History of Saskatoon}}
[[File:BarrColonists.jpg|thumb|left|[[Isaac Barr|Barr]] Colonists in Saskatoon in 1903. The settlement of Saskatoon saw an economic boom when the travelling Barr Colonists encamped around the community.]]
In 1882, the [[Toronto]]-based Temperance Colonization Society was granted 21 [[Section (United States land surveying)|sections]] of land straddling the South Saskatchewan River, between what is now [[Warman, Saskatchewan|Warman]] and [[Dundurn, Saskatchewan|Dundurn]]. The aim of the group was to escape the liquor trade in Toronto and set up a "dry" community in the [[Prairie]] region. The following year settlers, led by [[John Neilson Lake]], arrived on the site of what is now Saskatoon and established the first permanent settlement. The settlers travelled by railway from [[Ontario]] to [[Moose Jaw]] and then completed the final leg via horse-drawn cart, as the railway had yet to be completed to Saskatoon.<ref name=HistoryTo1914>{{cite web|url=http://www.saskatoon100.ca/docs/SaskatoonHistoryto1914.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003192952/http://www.saskatoon100.ca/docs/SaskatoonHistoryto1914.pdf |archive-date=2006-10-03 |title=A History of Saskatoon to 1914 |date=July 2005 |access-date=2009-04-04}}</ref><ref>Although the permanent settlement was started in 1883, Saskatoon dates its founding to 1882, hence its "Century Saskatoon" centennial celebrations occurring in 1982, not 1983.</ref>

In 1885 the [[North-West Rebellion]] affected the tiny community in a variety of ways. [[Chief Whitecap]] and Charles Trottier passed through the present day University campus on their way to join [[Louis Riel]]'s armed forces at [[Batoche, Saskatchewan]]. Following the fighting at the [[Battle of Fish Creek]], and the [[Battle of Batoche]], wounded Canadian soldiers convalesced at the [[Marr Residence]] which is today a historic site. A few died in care and were buried in the [[Nutana Pioneer Cemetery|Pioneer Cemetery]] near the Exhibition Grounds.

A town charter for the west side of the river was obtained in 1903, and this settlement adopted the name Saskatoon; the original townsite, which became a village that year, was renamed Nutana. In 1906 Saskatoon became a city with a population of 4,500, which included the communities of Saskatoon, Riversdale and Nutana. In 1955, a newly established community west of the city, [[Montgomery Place, Saskatoon|Montgomery Place]], was [[annexation|annexed]], followed by the neighbouring town of [[Sutherland, Saskatoon|Sutherland]] in 1956.<ref>{{cite book

==Geography==
{{Main article|List of neighbourhoods in Saskatoon}}
[[File:Parkland near Saskatoon.jpg|thumb|View of the [[Aspen parkland]] outside the city limits. The area is a [[ecotone|transitional biome]] between the boreal forest and prairies.]]
Saskatoon lies on a long belt of rich, potassic [[chernozem]] in middle-southern Saskatchewan and is found in the [[aspen parkland]] biome. The lack of surrounding mountainous topography gives the city a relatively flat grid, though the city does sprawl over a few hills and into a few valleys. The lowest point in the city is the river, while the highest point is in the [[Sutherland, Saskatoon|Sutherland]]-[[College Park, Saskatoon|College Park]] area.<ref>{{cite web
|url = https://en-ca.topographic-map.com/map-s4hcz/Saskatoon/?center=52.1259%2C-106.63536&lock=15%2C500%2C518
|title = Saskatoon topographic map
|publisher = World Topographic Map
|access-date = 2024-04-26}}</ref> Saskatoon, on a cross-section from west to east, has a general decline in elevation above sea level heading towards the river, and on the east bank of the river, the terrain is mostly level until outside the city, where it begins to decrease in elevation again.

Saskatoon is divided into east and west sides by the [[South Saskatchewan River]]. It is then divided into Suburban Development Areas (SDA) which are composed of neighbourhoods.<ref>{{cite web
|url = http://www.saskatoon.ca/org/city_planning/
|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080607104710/http://www.saskatoon.ca/org/city_planning/
|archive-date = 2008-06-07
|title = City Planning
|publisher = City of Saskatoon
|access-date = 2009-07-10}}</ref> Street addresses are demarcated into north and south (for avenues aligned in those directions) and similar east and west (for streets aligned in those directions). West of the river, the demarcation line for north and south addresses is 22nd Street, while east and west are divided by Idylwyld Drive (north of 20th Street) and Avenue A (south of 20th). On the east side, in order to line up with 22nd/Idylwyld, Lorne Avenue demarcates east and west while Aird Street, a minor residential road, marks the north–south boundary, except in the [[Sutherland, Saskatoon|Sutherland]] community where a separate east/west demarcation takes place with Central Avenue as the boundary (there is, however, no separate north–south divide). As a result of the unusual demarcation on the east side, few streets there actually carry a "North" or "West" designation, and only a few streets in Sutherland are demarcated "East" and "West".

A second major water feature aside from the river is the Hudson Bay Slough, a remnant of a glacier-formed body of water that at one time dominated the northern end of the city. Industrial development has resulted in most of the slough being drained, however a large remnant has been preserved off Avenue C as part of RCAF Memorial Park, and another portion remains intact within the Hudson Bay Industrial area. Several residential communities also feature "man-made lakes," with [[Lakeview, Saskatoon|Lakeview]] (developed from the early 1980s) being the first.

[[Pike Lake Provincial Park|Pike Lake]] and [[Blackstrap Provincial Park]]s are both approximately {{cvt|40|km}} south of the city on [[Saskatchewan Highway 60|Highway 60]] and [[Saskatchewan Highway 11|Highway 11]], respectively. [[Batoche, Saskatchewan|Batoche]], a national historic site associated with the [[North-West Rebellion]] of 1885, is {{cvt|90|km}} north of the city. Both Blackstrap and Batoche are popular destinations for school field trips.

===Climate===
Saskatoon experiences a borderline [[semi-arid climate|cold semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''BSk'') to [[humid continental climate]]  (''Dfb''), with typically warm summers and long, cold winters. Climate data from [[University of Saskatchewan]], in the inner city meets semi-arid criteria. This is due to slightly higher average annual temperature and slightly lower average annual precipitation than the Airport, on the city's northwest periphery.
[[File:Saskatoon in Winter.jpg|thumb|left|Winter skyline of Saskatoon with the [[South Saskatchewan River]] bisecting the city. Winters in the city are long, and cold.]]
The city has four distinct seasons and is in plant [[hardiness zone]] 3b.<ref name="Canadian Plant Hardiness Zones">{{cite web|title=Plant Hardiness Zone by Municipality|url=http://www.planthardiness.gc.ca/?m=22&lang=en&prov=Saskatchewan&val=S|publisher=Government of Canada|access-date=31 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817130846/http://www.planthardiness.gc.ca/?m=22&lang=en&prov=Saskatchewan&val=S|archive-date=August 17, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Saskatoon has a dry climate and sees {{cvt|352.3|mm}} of precipitation per year on average, with the summer being the wettest season.

The Saskatoon area was inhabited long before any permanent settlement was established, to which the ongoing archaeological work at [[Wanuskewin Heritage Park]] and other locations bears witness. Canada's [[First Nations in Canada|First Nations]] population has been increasingly urbanized, and nowhere is that more apparent than in Saskatoon, where the First Nations population increased by 382% from 1981 to 2001;<ref name=statscan1>[http://www.statcan.ca/bsolc/english/bsolc?catno=89-613-MIE2005008 Aboriginal Conditions in Census Metropolitan Areas, 1981–2001] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703003539/http://www.statcan.ca/bsolc/english/bsolc?catno=89-613-MIE2005008 |date=July 3, 2007 }}, Statistics Canada, {{ISBN|0-662-40884-5}}, Table 1.</ref> however, a portion of this increase, possibly as much as half, is believed to be due to more people identifying themselves as Indigenous in the census rather than migration or birth rate.

==Culture==
===Events and festivals===
Saskatoon's major arts venue is [[TCU Place]], which is next to Midtown Plaza downtown. Since opening in 1967, it has hosted scores of concerts, theatrical performances, live events such as the Telemiracle [[telethon]], high school graduation and university [[convocation]] ceremonies, and conventions. It is also home to the [[Saskatoon Symphony Orchestra]]. It recently underwent a multimillion-dollar renovation to its main theatre (named in honour of former mayor and senator [[Sidney Buckwold]]).
[[File:ShakespeareOnTheSaskatchewan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shakespeare on the Saskatchewan]] is an annual [[Shakespeare in the Park]] festival held in Saskatoon.]]
For rock concerts and major shows, [[SaskTel Centre]] is the main venue. It is Saskatchewan's
largest arena, with a capacity of 15,195 for sporting events and 14,000 for concerts.

For over 25 years, Saskatoon has hosted a gathering of antique automobiles, (mainly from the 1960s) that has grown into an event called "Cruise Weekend". The event is usually held on the last weekend (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) in August. Activities include a poker derby, dances, and a show 'N' shine with over 800 cars from all over western Canada. No admission is charged and everyone is free to walk around and enjoy the atmosphere.

The city's annual exhibition (now called the Saskatoon Exhibition but also known in previous years as Pioneer Days and "The Ex") is held every August at [[Prairieland Park]]. In the late 1990s, the Saskatoon Exhibition was rescheduled to August so that it no longer was in direct competition with the [[Calgary Stampede]], which frequently overlapped the event.

Saskatoon's [[Sikh]] community celebrates the festival of [[Vaisakhi]] with a parade held in May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/sikh-parade-saskatoon-crowd-1.4134571|title=1st-ever Saskatoon Sikh Parade was so busy it spurred a traffic advisory|access-date=28 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170530135826/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/sikh-parade-saskatoon-crowd-1.4134571|archive-date=May 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Saskatchewan Railway Museum]] is just outside the city and includes displays of rolling stock and historic railway buildings from various parts of the province.

The [[Forestry Farm Park and Zoo]] is a National Historic Site situated in the northeast region of the city. The Forestry Farm was a historic nursery (dating from 1913) responsible for growing many of the trees planted within the prairie provinces. In 1966 the nursery operations were discontinued and part of the region turned into a municipal park. The city zoo is also housed within the park and features over 80 species of animals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.saskatoon.ca/org/leisure/facilities/pdfs/zoobrochure.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626072019/http://www.saskatoon.ca/org/leisure/facilities/pdfs/zoobrochure.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Zoo Brochure|archive-date=June 26, 2008}}</ref>

The [[Broadway Theatre (Saskatoon)|Broadway Theatre]] primarily shows [[art film|arthouse films]] – while the two-screen [[Roxy Theatre (Saskatoon)|Roxy Theatre]] is an "atmospheric-style" [[discount theater|second-run theatre]] that reopened in 2005 after sitting unused for over a decade. The remainder of the city's theatres are [[multiplex (movie theater)|multiplexes]].

===Other attractions===
One of the city's landmarks is the [[Delta Bessborough]] Hotel, known to locals as the ''Bez''. Built by the [[Canadian National Railway]], it was among the last [[Canada's grand railway hotels|railway hotels]] to be started before the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s brought their era to a close. Although the building was completed in 1932, it did not open its doors until 1935 due to the Depression. The Bessborough and the [[Mendel Art Gallery]] are the only major structures on the river side of Spadina Crescent. One of the most frequently circulated photographs of Saskatoon is of the hotel framed in one of the arches of the [[Broadway Bridge (Saskatoon)|Broadway Bridge]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.saskatoonkiosk.ca/history.php |title=History of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan |publisher=Saskatoonkiosk.ca |access-date=2011-05-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411113603/http://www.saskatoonkiosk.ca/history.php |archive-date=April 11, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The outdoor rink has been open since 1980.

For years, a parcel of land west of the [[Traffic Bridge]], south of 19th Street, and east of Avenue C has been the subject of on-again, off-again redevelopment plans. The site formerly held the Saskatoon Arena, a power plant, a branch of the [[Royal Canadian Legion]], and the head offices of the [[Saskatoon Public School Division]]; all these structures have been demolished to make way for redevelopment, with plans for same dating back to the 1980s.

==Government and politics==
===Local===
Municipal elections are held in the fall. Until 1954, Saskatoon's mayors served one-year terms while City Councillors (aldermen, until 1991) were elected for two years. After 1954, both served for two-year terms. Beginning with the 1970 election, terms for both were extended to three years, and to four years starting in 2016. Until the 1976 election, terms didn't start until the new year. The years of service given are actual calendar years (give or take a day or two). But beginning in 1976 year, the Mayor and Council were sworn in at the next meeting after the election, so that an alderman whose dates of service are 1976-1979 has served from Nov 1, 1976 to Nov. 5, 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.saskatoon.ca/community-culture-heritage/saskatoon-history-archives/history|title=History|publisher=City of Saskatoon|access-date=2022-01-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415123817/https://www.saskatoon.ca/community-culture-heritage/saskatoon-history-archives/history|archive-date=April 15, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Saskatoon railway station]] is in the city's west end; it opened in the late 1960s as a replacement for Saskatoon's [[Saskatoon station (Canadian Pacific Railway)|original main station]] which was on 1st Avenue downtown—the relocation of the station sparked a major redevelopment of the downtown that included the construction of the [[Midtown Plaza (Saskatoon)|Midtown Plaza]], [[TCU Place]] (originally named the Centennial Auditorium) and other developments. The many provincial transportation connections and geographic location of Saskatoon give it one of its nicknames ''The Hub City''. The [[Saskatchewan Railway Museum]] is just outside the city.

==The Canadian Crown in Saskatoon==
{{Main article|The Canadian Crown in Saskatoon}}
[[File:Royal University Hospital.jpg|thumb|The [[Royal University Hospital]] is one of four institutions in Saskatoon that was [[List of Canadian organizations with royal prefix|designated with royal status]] from the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian monarchy]]. The hospital received royal status from Queen [[Elizabeth II]] in 1990.]]
Saskatoon has welcomed members of the Royal Family since 1919. [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]] most recently visited for a gala concert at Credit Union Centre, before a live audience of 12,000 and television viewers nationwide in 2005. The Queen was presented with the key to the city on the same visit, after touring the Canadian Light Source synchrotron and greeting thousands of well-wishers on a walkabout at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] (the Queen traditionally stayed at the on-campus residence of the President of the University of Saskatchewan when she visited the city). Sovereigns and consorts who have visited include [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] as Prince of Wales in 1919, [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] in 1939, and [[Elizabeth II]] and the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]], as Princess Elizabeth in 1951 and afterwards as Queen in 1959, 1978, 1987 and 2005.

Other members of the Royal Family who have visited include [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]] in 1980, the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] Charles (now Charles III) in 2001, the [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] in 1982 and (as Princess Royal) in 2004, the [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Duke]] and [[Sarah, Duchess of York|Duchess of York]] (Andrew and Sarah) in 1989, and the [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]] in 1978. [[Governor General of Canada|Governors General]] and [[Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan|Lieutenant Governors]] also pay regular visits to Saskatoon. Saskatonian [[Ray Hnatyshyn]] is credited with popularising his office as Governor General from 1990 to 1995. Saskatchewan Lieutenant Governors [[Gordon Barnhart|Barnhart]], [[Sylvia Fedoruk|Fedoruk]], McNab, Monroe, [[George Porteous|Porteous]] and [[Stephen Worobetz|Worobetz]] were all former residents of Saskatoon.

Connections to the crown include the royal namesakes of about one hundred neighbourhoods, parks, streets, schools and other places. These include [[King George, Saskatoon|King George]], [[Queen Elizabeth, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|Queen Elizabeth]] and [[Massey Place, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|Massey Place]] neighbourhoods, and Victoria, Coronation and Princess Diana parks. It was at one time considered that Saskatoon's Broadway Bridge would be renamed George V Bridge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.city.saskatoon.sk.ca/org/clerks_office/archives/exhibit/aerial/landmark_key.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227100512/http://www.city.saskatoon.sk.ca/org/clerks_office/archives/exhibit/aerial/landmark_key.html|url-status=dead|title=Key to Landmarks|archive-date=December 27, 2005}}</ref> Landmarks and institutions also have connections and these include the [[Royal University Hospital]], one of four royal designations in Saskatchewan. Grade schools named for royals include Ecole Victoria School, King George School, Queen Elizabeth School, Prince Philip School and Princess Alexandra School.

Existing and historic hotels with royal namesakes include the King George Hotel which has been recently converted to ultra-luxury condominiums, the King Edward Hotel, the Queen's Hotel and the Patricia Hotel. The [[Hotel Bessborough]] was named for a Canadian Governor General who visited the landmark under construction in the 1930s. The [[Queen Elizabeth Power Station]] is within the city and named after Queen Elizabeth. The Prince of Wales Promenade along the [[South Saskatchewan River]] is a focal point on the riverfront trails. In 2002, 378 Saskatoon residents were presented with Canada's [[Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal|Golden Jubilee Medal]] by vice-regals to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Queen's accession to the throne.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gg.ca/honours/search-recherche/index_e.asp?TypeID=jubilee|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080207182719/http://www.gg.ca/honours/search-recherche/index_e.asp?TypeID=jubilee|url-status=dead|title=Government House Canadian Honours database|archive-date=February 7, 2008}}</ref>

== Sister cities ==
Saskatoon has partnered itself with three cities around the world. It has not taken on a new partnership since joining with Chernvitsi in 1991. The city says it is working on a proper policy and management framework for handling new applications as [[Madison, Wisconsin]] applied to be a twin in 2018, but was told Saskatoon had no intention to move forward with the plan "at this time."<ref>{{Cite web |title=CBC: Saskatoon rejects potential twin with Madison, Wis. |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/saskatoon-sister-city-request-1.4954092}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=City of Saskatoon unprepared to adopt Madison, Wis. as sister city |url=https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/city-of-saskatoon-unprepared-to-adopt-madison-wis-as-sister-city |access-date=2023-02-03 |website=thestarphoenix |language=en-CA}}</ref>{{div col|colwidth=20em}}
