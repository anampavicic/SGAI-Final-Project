== Geography ==

Ilsan New Town vaguely comes to mind, but in reality, the eastern boundary is [[Bukhansan]], the western boundary is the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]], and the city area itself is large and has various geographical features. However, Bukhansan is a region protruding to the east, and the eastern end of the border with [[Seoul]] is actually a hilly area connecting Mt. Aengbong and Mt. Bongsan. Across the Han River to the west is the city of [[Gimpo]].

At the time of the expansion of Seoul, the eastern area was given to Seoul, but Bukhansan was guided, so if you look closely at the administrative divisions on the map, it looks like a kitchen knife or a stake. Bukhansan Mountain is clearly visible from the vicinity of Jichuk, and surprisingly, if you drive along the freeway from the middle floor of an apartment building in [[Ilsan New Town]] [10] or even from the side of Isanpo, you can see Bukhansan Mountain in the distance. You can roughly estimate the weather on that day by whether you can see it well or not.

=== Climate ===
