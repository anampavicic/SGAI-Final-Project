'''Barnaul''' ({{langx|ru|Барнау́л}}, {{IPA|ru|bərnɐˈul|IPA}}) is the largest [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] and [[administrative centre]] of [[Altai Krai]], [[Russia]], located at the [[confluence]] of the [[Barnaulka]] and [[Ob (river)|Ob River]]s in the [[West Siberian Plain]]. As of the [[Russian Census (2021)|2021 census]], its population was&nbsp;630,877,<ref name=2021Census>{{cite web|title=Оценка численности постоянного населения по субъектам Российской Федерации|url=https://rosstat.gov.ru/storage/mediabank/tab-5_VPN-2020.xlsx|publisher=[[Federal State Statistics Service (Russia)|Federal State Statistics Service]]|accessdate=1 September 2022}}</ref> making it the [[List of cities and towns in Russia by population|20th-largest city in Russia]] and the fourth-largest in the [[Siberian Federal District]].{{fact|date=November 2024}}

Located in the south of [[western Siberia]] on the left bank of the Ob River, Barnaul is a major transport, industrial, cultural, medical and educational hub of Siberia. Barnaul was founded by the wealthy [[Demidov]] family, who intended to develop the production of [[copper]] and [[silver]], which continued after the factories were taken over by the Crown. Barnaul became a major centre of silver production in Russia. Barnaul was granted city status in 1771.{{fact|date=November 2024}}

== Administrative and municipal status ==
Barnaul is the [[administrative centre]] of the krai.<ref name="AdmCtr">Charter of Altai Krai, Article&nbsp;6</ref> Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is, together with the [[urban-type settlement|work settlement]] of [[Yuzhny, Barnaul, Altai Krai|Yuzhny]] and twenty-four [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|rural localities]], incorporated as the '''[[city of federal subject significance|city of krai significance]] of Barnaul''' – an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Altai Krai|districts]].<ref name="AltaiK_adm">Law #28-ZS</ref> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the city of krai significance of Barnaul is incorporated as '''Barnaul Urban Okrug'''.<ref name="AltaiKBarnaul_mun">Law #144-ZS</ref>

== History ==
{{For timeline}}

=== Ancient history ===
The area around the city has been inhabited by [[Homo sapiens sapiens|modern humans]], [[Neanderthals]] and [[Denisovans]], for hundreds of thousands of years. They settled here to take advantage of the confluence of the rivers, used for transportation and fishing. In the late BC millennia, the locality was a centre of activity for [[Scythian]] and various [[Turkic peoples]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ijJ4o2iorhkC&pg=PA250|title=Scythians and Greeks: A Survey of Ancient History and Archaeology on the North Coast of the Euxine from the Danube to the Caucasus|first=Ellis Hovell|last=Minns|date=13 January 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-02487-7|access-date=1 January 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref>

=== Russian Empire ===
While 1730 is considered Barnaul's official establishment date, its first mention dates back to 1724.<ref name="CharterHist">Charter of Barnaul, Article&nbsp;4</ref> It was granted city status in 1771.<ref name="gr">{{cite book|title=Энциклопедия Города России|year=2003|publisher=Большая Российская Энциклопедия|location=Moscow|isbn=5-7107-7399-9|pages=36–38}}</ref> Chosen for its proximity to the mineral-rich Altai Mountains and its location on a major river, it was founded by the wealthy [[Demidov]] family.<ref name="gr" /> The Demidovs wanted to develop the [[copper]] in the mountains, and soon found substantial deposits of silver as well. In 1747, the Demidovs' factories were taken over by the Crown. Barnaul became the centre of silver production of the Russian Empire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://new.hist.asu.ru/biblio/borod5/got/15.html|title=Пятые Бородавкинские чтения|website=new.hist.asu.ru|access-date=1 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725201341/http://new.hist.asu.ru/biblio/borod5/got/15.html|archive-date=25 July 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1914, Barnaul was the site of the largest [[conscription]] riot in Russia during [[World War I]]. There were more than 100 casualties from the fighting.<ref>Sanborn, Josh. "The Mobilization of 1917 and the Question of the Russian Nation." ''Slavic Review,'' Vol. 59, No. 2: pp. 267-89.</ref>

Mary 'Marie' 'Maria' Stepanovna Zudilova Tatuloff Zacharenko Gurdin (1908–1998) was reputedly born in this city.<ref>Tatuloff, Alexander (17 September 1934). [https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:33S7-8BVN-8YJ Declaration of Intention, no. 89199]. ''U.S. District Court Naturalization Index, 1852–1989''.</ref> She later became the mother of American actresses [[Natalie Wood|Natalie]] and [[Lana Wood]]. Her father Stepan was reputedly killed in the 1918 street fighting between the Whites and Reds following the Revolution. Afterward her mother took Mary and her siblings as refugees to [[Harbin, China]]. Mary married Alexander Tatuloff there in 1925, and they had a daughter Olga together. Mary eventually immigrated to the United States, where she divorced Alexander in 1936 and later married Nicholas Zacharenko, from Ussuriysk, and had two daughters with him.{{fact|date=November 2024}}

=== World War II ===
Over half of the light ammunition used by the Soviet Union in [[World War II]] is estimated to have been manufactured in Barnaul.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ada.ru/Guns/bsz/index.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000115231932/http://www.ada.ru/Guns/bsz/index.htm|archive-date=15 January 2000|title=Барнаульские патроны}}</ref>

=== Recent history ===
In 2012, when residents of Barnaul were denied a permit for a street protest, they ingeniously circumvented the restriction by staging a demonstration with toys such as teddy bears, Lego figures, and toy soldiers holding signs denouncing electoral corruption. The photos of these rebellious figurines quickly spread across Russia, prompting others to replicate the protest. Faced with an awkward dilemma, Putin's government decided to ban the toy protests, asserting that toys, not being Russian citizens, were ineligible to participate in public gatherings, as explained by a government official.<ref>{{Cite web |last=VanHise |first=James L. |date=2021-09-21 |title=Dilemma Actions: The Power of Putting your Opponent in a Bind |url=https://commonslibrary.org/new-research-shows-the-power-of-putting-your-opponent-in-a-bind/ |access-date=2024-08-12 |website=The Commons Social Change Library |language=en-AU}}</ref>
