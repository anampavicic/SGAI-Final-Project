'''Calasiao''', officially the '''Municipality of Calasiao''' ({{langx|pag|Baley na Calasiao}}; {{langx|ilo|Ili ti Calasiao}}; {{langx|tl|Bayan ng Calasiao}}),  is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Pangasinan]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 100,471 people.{{PH census|current}}

Today, Calasiao is known as a first class, highly commercialized municipality and is strategically located at the heart of Pangasinan. It governs 24 barangays and 31 sitios in a total land area of 4,836 hectares. Being a town adjacent to the city of [[Dagupan]], the municipality experiences continuous economic boom and is increasingly becoming an important satellite commercial hub for Metro Dagupan.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.calasiao.gov.ph/2012-03-25-06-27-18/brief-history.html |title=Brief History |access-date=November 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928060134/http://www.calasiao.gov.ph/2012-03-25-06-27-18/brief-history.html |archive-date=September 28, 2012}}</ref> In terms of delicacy, Calasiao's flagship product is the native rice cake known as Puto Calasiao.

Calasiao is {{convert|3|km}} from [[Dagupan]], {{convert|17|km}} from [[Lingayen]], {{convert|206|km}} from [[Manila]], and {{convert|9|km}} from [[San Carlos, Pangasinan|San Carlos]].

==Etymology==
The name Calasiao was derived from the native word ''Kalasian'', which means "a place where lightning frequently occurs", from the root word ''lasi'', meaning "lightning". Upon the arrival of the Spaniards, they called the place "''Lugar de Rayos''", a literal Spanish translation of the word ''Kalasian''. It was named as such because it is said that Calasiao back in the day was always frequented by this natural phenomenon.

==History==
The indigenous people of Calasiao are descended from the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian-speaking people]] who settled in the Malay archipelago at least 5,000 years ago. Calasiao was settled by a [[Pangasinan language|Pangasinan speaking people]] whose language belongs to the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] branch of the [[Austronesian languages]] family.

In 1571, the [[Spanish conquest]] of Pangasinan began. The Spanish conquistadors were accompanied by [[Roman Catholic]] missionaries who introduced Roman Catholicism to the [[indigenous peoples]] of Pangasinan.

In the 16th century, Dominican friars, who were settling at Gabon, were driven out because of the continuing unrest in the town. The formation of the new Calasiao however was not immediately welcomed by its native inhabitants. Hence in 1660, when the call for the Malong Rebellion came, the citizens picked up their weapons and joined in the fight against the Spanish rule. The citizens were also one of the first people to answer the call for rebellion of Juan de la Cruz Palaris of Binalatongan (now San Carlos City), which succeeded in driving the Spanish rulers and friars out of the boundaries. The town of Calasiao became part of the Pangasinan encomendia of Labaya, designated as belonging to the King of Spain, Juan Ximenez del opaline, and a son of Alonso Hernandez de Sandoval for whom tributes were collected.[https://web.archive.org/web/20120928060134/http://www.calasiao.gov.ph/2012-03-25-06-27-18/brief-history.html]

Today, Calasiao is rapidly expanding town. It may soon become a city or join with Dagupan and San Carlos City to be a [[metropolis]]. Yet many people from Calasiao have emigrated to other parts of the Philippines, the [[United States]] and other countries to seek better opportunities.

==Geography==
===Barangays===
Calasiao is politically subdivided into 24 [[barangay]]s.<ref name=nscb>{{cite web|title=Province: PANGASINAN |url=http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/province.asp?regName=REGION+I+%28Ilocos+Region%29&regCode=01&provCode=015500000&provName=PANGASINAN |work=PSGC Interactive |publisher=National Statistical Coordination Board |access-date=November 26, 2012 |location=Makati, Philippines |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114165526/http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/province.asp?regName=REGION+I+%28Ilocos+Region%29&regCode=01&provCode=015500000&provName=PANGASINAN |archive-date=November 14, 2012 }}</ref> Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s and some have [[sitios]].

Calasiao is a short ride to the [[Bonuan Gueset#Landmarks & Tourist Attractions|Bonuan Blue Beach]] and the [[Hundred Islands]] in [[Lingayen Gulf]]. Calasiao is about 2 hour ride to Baguio City and a four-hour ride to Manila.

Calasiao is known for its [[Puto (food)|puto]], a soft rice cake; [[Suman (food)|suman]], a sweet coconut and sticky rice cake wrapped in banana leaves; and [[bagoong]], or fermented fish paste. Calasiao puto is described as the town's "white gold."{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}  Calasiao ''puto'' is a bite-size, soft rice cake made from semi-glutinous rice that is fermented in earthen jars. It is produced mainly in Barangay Dinalaoan.

Many pilgrims from neighbouring cities/towns and provinces visit Calasiao to pray at the Senor Divino Tesoro shrine. The statue of a crucified Jesus Christ is believed to grow in size and grant miracles.

===Puto festival===
[[File:Calasiao11gjf.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Special Puto (Calasiao stores).]]
Calasiao celebrates a puto industry festival. The ''Calasiao puto'' is a rice cake that is well known all over the Philippines for its melt-in-the-mouth feeling. It is locally sold along the streets going to Sr. Divino Tesoro.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

It is known for its "white gold": "cup-shaped, bite-sized, soft rice cakes; the semi-glutinous rice is fermented in old earthen jars" (in villages of Dinalaoan, Lumbang, Ambuetel, and part of Nalsian).<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/topstories/topstories/view/20080503-134365/Free-puto-as-Pangasinan-town-celebrates-rice-cake-festival |title=Inquirer.net, Free puto as Pangasinan town celebrates rice cake festival |access-date=May 3, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527175757/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/topstories/topstories/view/20080503-134365/Free-puto-as-Pangasinan-town-celebrates-rice-cake-festival |archive-date=May 27, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Calasiao puto is made of long grain rice soaked in water, ground and fermented for three days of more, with just enough sugar to taste, and steamed. It can be topped with cheese or drizzled with chocolate syrup for variation. It is perfect to be paired with [[dinuguan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.asensopangasinan.com/festivals/puto-festival-of-calasiao/|title = Puto Festival of Calasiao|date = October 6, 2010}}</ref> The town has the traditional white puto and many flavors like pandan (green), ube (violet), banana (yellow), strawberry (light red/pink) and cheese (gold).

The original white puto and kutsinta (another rice cake variety) is sold at P80 per kilogram (70 to 75 pieces), while the flavored ones are sold at P80 per kg. The price is higher by P15 to P20 in other areas to cover transportation costs.

Bella's Puto consumes three to six sacks of rice a day to make puto, depending on the season. Peak production period is from October to January. A sack of rice can produce 8,000 pieces or 107&nbsp;kg of puto. Bella's Puto is sold at four SM shopping mall branches, in Santa Mesa (Manila), Baliwag (Bulacan), Clark (Pampanga) and Rosales (Pangasinan). It is also sold in a store in Caloocan and at the Pasalubong Center in Rosales town.<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|url=http://business.inquirer.net/money/topstories/view/20090816-220505/United-colors-of-Calasiao-puto |title=Business - United colors of Calasiao puto - INQUIRER.net |access-date=November 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228164436/http://business.inquirer.net/money/topstories/view/20090816-220505/United-colors-of-Calasiao-puto |archive-date=December 28, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
