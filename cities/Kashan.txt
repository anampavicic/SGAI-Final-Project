==History==

Earliest evidence of human presence around Kashan date back to [[Paleolithic]] period that have been found at Niasar, Kaftar Khoun and Sefid-Ab. Middle Paleolithic stone tools were discovered at travertine spring of Niasar and the travertine of Kaftar Khoun.<ref>Biglari, F.

By some accounts, although not all, Kashan was the origin of the [[three wise men]] who followed the star that guided them to Bethlehem to witness the [[nativity of Jesus]], as recounted in the [[Bible]].<ref>Elgood, Cyril.

According to a legend dating from the [[Safavid Iran|Safavid]] era, [[Abu Lu'lu'a]], the [[Persian people|Persian]] skilled craftsman who was [[Islamic views on slavery|enslaved]] by the Islamic conquerors and who eventually assassinated the caliph [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] in 644, fled to Kashan after the assassination.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Rosemary Stanfield|date=1994|title=Sunni Survival in Safavid Iran: Anti-Sunni Activities During the Reign of Tahmasp I|journal=Iranian Studies|volume=27|issue=1–4|pages=123–133|doi=10.1080/00210869408701823|jstor=4310889|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4310889}} p. 127, note 23.

== Geography ==
Kashan is divided into two parts, mountainous and desert. 
 
===Location===
The city of Kashan is located in the north of Isfahan province, north of the  [[Karkas Mountains]] and west of [[Dasht-e Kavir]] desert, where it is poor in terms of vegetation and where bushes and shrubs are more or less found.

===Mountains===
Dare mountain is next to Dare village and 14 kilometers southwest of Kashan with a height of 2,985 meters overlooking the city of Kashan, and Gargash peak is the second highest peak of the Karkas mountain range (the first is mount Karakas in Natanz), 33 kilometers southwest of Kashan and 12 kilometers southwest of Qamsar and 7 kilometers northeast of Kamu with a height of 3,600 meters is located near the city of Kamu and Chogan. Kashan has the least light and [[air pollution]]. For this reason, it was chosen by international experts as the most appropriate and best place to establish the National Observatory of Iran, and the home of one of the largest large telescopes in the Middle East with the latest technology.

Ardahal peak is located 35 kilometers west of Kashan with a height of 3505 meters after Gargash, is the highest point of Kashan heights (continuation of the central mountain range) in the vicinity of Niaser and the villages Nashlej and Mashhad.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kashan |url=https://www.visitiran.ir/destination/kashan |access-date=2023-03-17 |website=www.visitiran.ir |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Foundation |first=Encyclopaedia Iranica |title=Welcome to Encyclopaedia Iranica |url=https://iranicaonline.org/ |access-date=2023-03-17 |website=iranicaonline.org |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Climate===

Kashan has a [[hot desert climate]], with (''BWh'') designation in [[Köppen climate classification]] and (''BW'') in [[Trewartha climate classification]], with cold winters (although warmer than other Iranian cities) and very hot and dry summers. Kashan is significantly warmer than other cities in the [[Iranian Plateau]] due to its lower elevation.

==Main sights==
On August 9, 2007, Iran placed the Historical Axis of [[Fin Garden|Fin]], [[Tepe Sialk|Sialk]], Kashan on its Tentative List for possible future nomination as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. The exact definition of what locations within Kashan proper might be nominated was not made clear. In 2012 Iran successfully nominated the [[Fin Garden]] separately for inscription by UNESCO as a part of its Persian Gardens World Heritage Site. Despite this the "Historical-Cultural Axis of Fin, Sialk, Kashan" remains in full on Iran's Tentative List. The [[Borujerdi House|Boroujerdiha house]] is one of the historical places from the [[Qajar art|Qajar]] period.
