It is the [[List of cities in Germany by population|12th most populous city]] of Germany, the fourth largest by area (after [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]], and [[Cologne]]), and the third most populous city in the area of former [[East Germany]], after Berlin and Leipzig. Dresden's urban area comprises the towns of [[Freital]], [[Pirna]], [[Radebeul]], [[Meissen]], [[Coswig, Saxony|Coswig]], [[Radeberg]] and [[Heidenau]] and has around 790,000 inhabitants.<ref name="citypopulation.de quoting Federal Statistics Office">{{cite web|url=http://citypopulation.de/en/germany/urbanareas/|author=citypopulation.de quoting Federal Statistics Office|title=Germany: Urban Areas|access-date=3 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200603133151/http://citypopulation.de/en/germany/urbanareas/|archive-date=3 June 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The Dresden metropolitan area has approximately 1.34 million inhabitants.<ref name="Eurostat">{{cite web|url=http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=met_pjanaggr3&lang=en|title=Population on 1 January by broad age group, sex and metropolitan regions|publisher=Eurostat|access-date=3 June 2020|archive-date=3 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181203055500/http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=met_pjanaggr3&lang=en|url-status=live}}</ref>

Dresden is the second largest city on the [[River Elbe]] after Hamburg. Most of the city's population lives in the [[Dresden Basin|Elbe Valley]], but a large, albeit very sparsely populated, area of the city east of the Elbe lies in the [[West Lusatian Hill Country and Uplands]] (the westernmost part of the [[Sudetes]]) and thus in [[Lusatia]]. Many boroughs west of the Elbe lie in the [[Ore Mountain Foreland]], as well as in the valleys of the rivers rising there and flowing through Dresden, the longest of which are the [[Weißeritz]] and the [[Lockwitzbach]]. The name of the city as well as the names of most of its boroughs and rivers are of [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]] origin.

Dresden has a long history as the capital and royal residence for the [[Prince-Elector|Electors]] and [[Kingdom of Saxony|Kings of Saxony]], who for centuries furnished the city with cultural and artistic splendor, and was once by [[Personal union of Poland and Saxony|personal union]] the family seat of [[List of Polish monarchs|Polish]] monarchs. The city was known as the Jewel Box, because of its [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] city centre. The controversial American and British [[bombing of Dresden]] towards the end of [[World War II]] killed approximately 25,000 people, most of whom were civilians, and destroyed the entire city centre. After the war, restoration work has helped to reconstruct parts of the historic inner city.

Since [[German reunification]] in 1990, Dresden has once again become a cultural, educational and political centre of Germany. The [[Dresden University of Technology]] is one of the 10 largest universities in Germany and part of the [[German Universities Excellence Initiative]]. The economy of Dresden and its agglomeration is one of the most dynamic in Germany and ranks first in Saxony.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dresden.de/de/wirtschaft/wirtschaftsstandort-dresden.php|title=Wirtschaftsstandort|last=Dresden|website=www.dresden.de|language=de|access-date=20 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200206045800/https://www.dresden.de/de/wirtschaft/wirtschaftsstandort-dresden.php|archive-date=6 February 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref> It is dominated by [[High tech|high-tech branches]], often called "[[Silicon Saxony]]".

Furthermore, the city is home to the renowned [[Dresden State Art Collections]], originating from the collections of the Saxon electors in the 16th century.

[[Dietrich, Margrave of Meissen]], chose Dresden as his interim residence in 1206, as documented in a record calling the place "Civitas Dresdene".

After 1270, Dresden became the capital of the margraviate. It was given to [[:de:Friedrich Clem|Friedrich Clem]] after the death of [[Henry III, Margrave of Meissen|Henry the Illustrious]] in 1288. It was taken by the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] in 1316 and was restored to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] dynasty after the death of [[Waldemar, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal|Valdemar the Great]] in 1319. From 1485, it was the seat of the dukes of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]], and from 1547 the [[Prince-elector|electors]] as well.

===19th and early 20th century===
[[File:Brodowski Napoleon Elbe.jpg|thumb|''[[Napoleon]] Crossing the [[Elbe]]'' by [[Józef Brodowski the Younger|Józef Brodowski]] (1895)]]

In 1806, Dresden became the capital of the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] established by [[Napoleon]]. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] the French Emperor made it a [[Headquarters|base of operations]], winning there the [[Battle of Dresden]] on 27 August 1813. As a result of the [[Congress of Vienna]], the Kingdom of Saxony became part of the [[German Confederation]] in 1815. Following the Polish uprisings of [[November Uprising|1831]], [[Greater Poland uprising (1848)|1848]] and [[January Uprising|1863]] many Poles fled to Dresden, including the artistic and political elite, such as composer [[Frédéric Chopin]], war hero [[Józef Bem]] and writer [[Adam Mickiewicz]].<ref name=ams>{{cite magazine|last=Sadowski|first=Aleksander Marek|year=2022|title=Sachsen und Polen – Tausend Jahre Nachbarschaft / Polska i Saksonia – tysiąc lat sąsiedztwa|magazine=Polonus|language=de,pl|location=Ostritz|issue=5|page=39|issn=2701-6285}}</ref> Mickiewicz wrote one of his greatest works, [[Dziady (poem)|''Dziady'', Part III]], there.<ref name=ams/> Dresden itself was a centre of the [[German revolutions of 1848–49|German Revolutions]] in 1848–1849 with the [[May Uprising in Dresden|May Uprising]], which cost human lives and damaged the historic town of Dresden.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Dresdner Maiaufstand |url=https://www.demokratie-geschichte.de/karte/2397 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231018140919/https://www.demokratie-geschichte.de/karte/2397 |archive-date=2023-10-18 |access-date=2024-01-22 |website=AG Orte der Demokratiegeschichte |language=de}}</ref> The uprising forced [[Frederick Augustus II of Saxony]] to flee from Dresden, but he soon after regained control over the city with the help of Prussia. In 1852, the population of Dresden grew to 100,000 inhabitants, making it one of the biggest cities within the German Confederation.

As the capital of the Kingdom of Saxony, Dresden became part of the newly founded [[German Empire]] in 1871. In the following years, the city became a major centre of economy, including motor car production, food processing, banking and the manufacture of [[medical equipment]]. In the early 20th century, Dresden was particularly well known for its camera works and its cigarette factories. During [[World War I]], the city did not suffer any war damage, but lost many of its inhabitants. Between 1918 and 1934, Dresden was the capital of the first Free State of Saxony as well as a cultural and economic centre of the [[Weimar Republic]]. The city was also a centre of European [[modern art]] until 1933.

During the foundation of the German Empire in 1871, a large military facility called [[Albertstadt]] was built.<ref>Rüdiger Nern, Erich Sachße, Bert Wawrzinek. ''Die Dresdner Albertstadt''. Dresden, 1994; ''Albertstadt&nbsp;– sämtliche Militärbauten in Dresden''. Dresden, 1880</ref> It had a capacity of up to 20,000 [[Soldier|military personnel]] at the beginning of the [[First World War]]. The garrison saw only limited use between 1918 and 1934, but was then reactivated in preparation for the [[Second World War]].

Its usefulness was limited by attacks on [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|13–15 February]] and 17 April 1945, the former of which destroyed large areas of the city.

The Albertstadt garrison became the headquarters of the [[Soviet 1st Guards Tank Army]] in the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany]] after the war. Apart from the [[German Army|German army]] officers' school (''Offizierschule des Heeres''), there have been no more [[military unit]]s in Dresden since the army merger during German reunification, and the withdrawal of Soviet forces in 1992. Nowadays, the Bundeswehr operates the [[Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr|Military History Museum]] of the Federal Republic of Germany in the former Albertstadt garrison.

Two book burnings were organised in the city in 1933, one by the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] on Wettiner Platz, the second one by [[German Student Union]] at the [[Bismarck tower|Bismarck Column]] on Räcknitzhöhe.<ref>[https://tu-dresden.de/gsw/phil/ige/das-institut/news/gedenken-10-mai?set_language=en TU Dresden reflects on its history: Critical campus tour to commemorate the book burning 90 years ago]</ref>

During the Nazi era from 1933 to 1945, the Jewish community of Dresden was reduced from over 6,000 (7,100 people were persecuted as Jews) to 41, mostly as a result of emigration, but later also deportation and murder.<ref>{{cite web|title=Names of Jewish victims of National Socialism in Dresden between 1933 and 1945|website=Stiftung Sächsische Gedenkstätten|url=https://en.stsg.de/cms/names-jewish-victims-dresden-1933-1945|access-date=20 July 2015|quote=Nearly two thirds of the Dresden Jews succeeded to emigrate before the extermination apparatus started to work.|archive-date=16 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416025207/https://en.stsg.de/cms/names-jewish-victims-dresden-1933-1945|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Dresden|website=Jewish Virtual Library|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0006_0_05398.html|access-date=20 July 2015|archive-date=26 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126063618/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0006_0_05398.html|url-status=live}}</ref> One of the survivors was [[Victor Klemperer]] with his non-Jewish wife, who believed that the bombing saved their lives.

{{Main|Bombing of Dresden}}
The [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) between 13 and 15 February 1945 was controversial. On the night of 13–14 February 1945, 773 RAF Lancaster bombers dropped 1,181.6 tons of incendiary bombs and 1,477.7 tons of high explosive bombs, targeting the rail yards at the centre of the city. The inner city of Dresden was largely destroyed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/14/newsid_3549000/3549905.stm|title=1945: Thousands of bombs destroy Dresden|work=BBC News|date=14 February 1945|access-date=5 May 2009|archive-date=11 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811071519/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/14/newsid_3549000/3549905.stm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>([http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/feb45.html RAF Bomber Command 60th Anniversary – Campaign Diary February 1945] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607042346/http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/feb45.html|date=7 June 2007}})</ref> Widely quoted Nazi propaganda reports claimed 200,000 deaths, but the German Dresden Historians' Commission, made up of 13 prominent German historians, in an official 2010 report published after five years of research concluded that casualties numbered between 22,500 and 25,000.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8574157.stm |title = Up to 25,000 died in Dresden's WWII bombing |publisher=BBC|date=18 March 2010}}</ref>

The destruction of Dresden allowed [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]], a major Nazi museum director and art dealer, to hide [[Gurlitt Collection|a large collection of artwork]] worth tens of millions of dollars that had been stolen during the Nazi era, as he claimed it had been destroyed along with his house which was located in Dresden.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=How 1,280 Artworks Stolen by the Nazis were Hidden in a Munich Apartment Until 2012|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2014/04/degenerate-art-cornelius-gurlitt-munich-apartment|magazine=Vanity Fair|access-date=20 July 2015|first=Alex|last=Shoumatoff|date=19 March 2014|archive-date=28 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210528133457/https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2014/04/degenerate-art-cornelius-gurlitt-munich-apartment|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Allies described the operation as the legitimate bombing of a military and industrial target.<ref name="Air Force Historical Studies Office" /> Several researchers have argued that the February attacks were [[Proportionality (law)#International law|disproportionate]].

Following his military service the German press photographer and photojournalist [[Richard Peter]] returned to Dresden and began to document the ruined city. Among his best known works ''Blick auf Dresden vom Rathausturm'' (''View of Dresden from the Rathaus Tower''). It has become one of the best known photographs of a ruined post-war Germany following its appearance in 1949 in his book ''Dresden, eine Kamera klagt an'' ("Dresden, a photographic accusation", {{ISBN|3-930195-03-8}}).<ref name="Jähner-2019">{{cite book |last= Jähner |first= Harald |title= Aftermath: Life in the Fallout of the Third Reich 1945–1955 |location= London |publisher= W H Allen |date= 2019 |pages= 23, 28, 29 |type= Paperback |language= EN |isbn= 9780753557877}}</ref>

When a skeleton previously used  as a model for drawing art classes was found in the ruins of the Dresden Art Academy, the photographer [[Edmund Kesting]] with the assistance of Peter posed it in a number of different locations to produce a series of haunting photographic images to give the impression that Death was wandering through the city in search of the dead.<ref name="Jähner-2019"/> Kesting subsequently published them in the book ''Dresdner Totentanz'' (''Dresden's Death Dance'').

The damage from the Allied air raids was so extensive that following the end of the Second World War, a narrow gauge light railway system was constructed to remove the debris, though being makeshift there were frequent derailments. This railway system, which had seven lines, employed 5,000 staff and 40 locomotives, all of which bore women's names. The last train remained in service until 1958, though the last official debris clearance team was only disbanded in 1977.<ref name="Jähner-2019"/>

Rather than repair them, [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany) authorities razed the ruins of many churches, royal buildings and palaces in the 1950s and 1960s, such as the Gothic [[Sophienkirche]], the Alberttheater and the [[Wackerbarth-Palais]] as well as many historic residential buildings. The surroundings of the once lively Prager Straße resembled a wasteland before it was rebuilt in the socialist style at the beginning of the 1960s.

However, the majority of historic buildings were saved or reconstructed. Among them were the Ständehaus (1946), the Augustusbrücke (1949), the Kreuzkirche (until 1955), the Zwinger (until 1963), the Catholic Court Church (until 1965), the Semperoper (until 1985), the Japanese Palace (until 1987) and the two largest train stations. Some of this work dragged on for decades, often interrupted by the overall economic situation in the GDR. The ruins of the Frauenkirche were allowed to remain on Neumarkt as a memorial to the war.

While the Theater and Schloßplatz were rebuilt in accordance with the historical model in 1990, the Neumarkt remained completely undeveloped. On the other hand buildings of socialist classicism and spatial design and orientation according to socialist ideals (e.g. Kulturpalast) were built at the Altmarkt.

From 1955 to 1958, a large part of the art treasures looted by the Soviet Union was returned, which meant that from 1960 onwards many state art collections could be opened in reconstructed facilities or interim exhibitions. Important orchestras such as the Staatskapelle performed in alternative venues (for example in the Kulturpalast from 1969). Some cultural institutions were moved out of the city center (for example the state library in Albertstadt). The Outer Neustadt, which was almost undamaged during the war was threatened with demolition in the 1980s following years of neglect, but was preserved following public protests.

To house the homeless large prefabricated housing estates were built on previously undeveloped land In Prohlis and Gorbitz. Damaged housing in the Johannstadt and other areas in the city center were demolished and replaced with large apartment blocks. The villa districts in Blasewitz, Striesen, Kleinzschachwitz, Loschwitz and on the Weißen Hirsch were largely preserved.

Dresden became a major industrial centre of East Germany, with a great deal of research infrastructure. It was the centre of [[Bezirk Dresden]] (Dresden District) between 1952 and 1990. Many of the city's important historic buildings were reconstructed, including the [[Semper Opera House]] and the [[Zwinger Palace]], although the city leaders chose to rebuild large areas of the city in a "socialist modern" style, partly for economic reasons, but also to break away from the city's past as the royal capital of Saxony and a stronghold of the German bourgeoisie.

Until the end of the Cold War, the [[1st Guards Tank Army]] of the Soviet Army and the 7th Panzer Division of the National People's Army were stationed in and around Dresden. Following  reunification in 1989, the Soviet / Russian troops were withdrawn from Germany in the early 1990s and the NVA dissolved in accordance with the provisions of the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|Two-Plus-Four Treaty of 1990]].

From 1985 to 1990, the future President of Russia, [[Vladimir Putin]], was stationed in Dresden by the [[KGB]], where he worked for [[Lazar Matveev]], the senior [[KGB]] liaison officer there. On 3 October 1989 (the so-called "battle of Dresden"), a convoy of trains carrying East German refugees from [[Prague]] passed through Dresden on its way to the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]. Local activists and residents joined in the growing [[civil disobedience]] movement spreading across the German Democratic Republic, by staging demonstrations and demanding the removal of the communist government.

===Post-reunification===
[[File:Sonnedd.jpg|thumb|The Dresden Frauenkirche, a few years after its reconsecration]]

Dresden has experienced dramatic changes since the reunification of Germany in the early 1990s. The city still bears many wounds from the [[Strategic bombing|bombing raids]] of 1945, but it has undergone significant reconstruction. Restoration of the Dresden Frauenkirche, a Lutheran church, began in 1994 and was completed in 2005, a year before Dresden's 800th anniversary; this was done with the help of privately raised funds. The gold cross on the top of the church was funded officially by "the British people and the House of Windsor". The [[urban renewal]] process, which includes the reconstruction of the area around the [[Neumarkt (Dresden)|Neumarkt square]] on which the Frauenkirche is situated, was expected to take decades, but numerous large projects were under way in the first part of the 21st century.

Dresden remains a major cultural centre of historical memory, owing to the city's destruction in World War II. Each year on 13 February, the anniversary of the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|British and American fire-bombing raid]] that destroyed most of the city, tens of thousands of demonstrators gather to commemorate the event. Since reunification, the ceremony has taken on a more neutral and pacifist tone (after being used more politically during the [[Cold War]]). Beginning in 1999, right-wing [[Neo-Nazi]] [[White Nationalism|white nationalist]] groups have organised demonstrations in Dresden that have been among the largest of their type in the post-war [[history of Germany]]. Each year around the anniversary of the city's destruction, people convene in the memory of those who died in the fire-bombing.

The completion of the reconstructed Dresden Frauenkirche in 2005 marked the first step in rebuilding the Neumarkt area. The areas around the square were divided into eight "quarters", with each being rebuilt as a separate project, the majority of buildings to be rebuilt either to the original structure or at least with a facade similar to the original. The quarters I, II, IV, V, VI and VIII have since been completed; quarters III and quarter VII were still partly under construction in 2020.

In 2002, torrential rains caused the [[Elbe]] to flood {{convert|9|m}} above its normal height, i.e., even higher than the old record height from 1845, damaging many landmarks (see [[2002 European floods]]). The destruction from this "millennium flood" is no longer visible, due to the speed of reconstruction.

The United Nations' cultural organization [[UNESCO]] declared the [[Dresden Elbe Valley]] to be a World Heritage Site in 2004.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1156 Dresden Elbe Valley] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191206155054/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1156 |date=6 December 2019 }}, UNESCO World Heritage Register.

Dresden is one of the greenest cities in all of Europe, with 62% of the city being green areas and forests.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dresden.de/de/stadtraum/umwelt/gruenes-dresden.php |title=Grünes Dresden |website=dresden.de |language=de |access-date=4 June 2020 |archive-date=3 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200603142509/https://www.dresden.de/de/stadtraum/umwelt/gruenes-dresden.php |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Dresden Heath]] (''Dresdner Heide'') to the north is a forest {{cvt|50|km2}} in size.

One important part of that landscape is the Elbe meadows, which cross the city in a 20 kilometre swath. [[Saxon Switzerland]] is located south-east of the city.

===Climate===
Like most of eastern Germany, Dresden has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), with significant continental influences due to its inland location. The summers are warm, averaging 19.0&nbsp;°C (66.2&nbsp;°F) in July. The winters are slightly colder than the German average, with a January average temperature of {{convert|0.1|°C|2|abbr=on}}. The driest months are February, March and April, with precipitation of around {{convert|40|mm|1|abbr=on}}. The wettest months are July and August, with more than {{convert|80|mm|1|abbr=on}} per month.

The microclimate in the [[Elbe valley]] differs from that on the slopes and in the higher areas, where the Dresden district [[Klotzsche]], at 227 metres [[above mean sea level|above sea level]], hosts the Dresden [[weather station]]. The weather in Klotzsche is {{convert|1|to|3|C-change|F-change|1|abbr=on}} colder than in the [[inner city]] at 112 metres [[above mean sea level|above sea level]].

===Flood protection===
Because of its location on the banks of the Elbe, into which some water sources from the Ore Mountains flow, flood protection is important. Large areas are kept free of buildings to provide a flood plain. Two additional trenches, about 50 metres wide, have been built to keep the inner city free of water from the Elbe, by dissipating the water downstream through the inner city's gorge portion. Flood regulation systems like [[detention basin]]s and [[water reservoir]]s are almost all outside the [[Urban area|city area]].

The [[Weißeritz]], normally a rather small river, suddenly ran directly into the main station of Dresden during the [[2002 European floods]]. This was largely because the river returned to its former route; it had been diverted so that a railway could run along the river bed.

Many locations and areas need to be protected by walls and sheet pilings during floods. A number of districts become waterlogged if the Elbe overflows across some of its former floodplains.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dresden.de/de/stadtraum/umwelt/umwelt/hochwasser/vergangenheit.php|title=Hochwasser in der Vergangenheit|website=www.dresden.de|accessdate=4 April 2023}}</ref>

===City structuring===

Dresden is a spacious city. Its boroughs differ in their structure and appearance. Many parts still contain an old village core, while some quarters are almost completely preserved as rural settings. Other characteristic kinds of urban areas are the historic outskirts of the city, and the former suburbs with scattered housing. During the German Democratic Republic, many apartment blocks were built. The original parts of the city are almost all in the boroughs of Altstadt (Old town) and Neustadt (New town). Growing outside the [[Defensive wall|city walls]], the historic outskirts were built in the 18th and 19th century. They were planned and constructed on the orders of the Saxon monarchs and many of them are named after Saxon sovereigns (e.g. [[Friedrichstadt (Dresden)|Friedrichstadt]] and [[Albertstadt]]). Dresden has been divided into ten boroughs called "Stadtbezirk" and nine former municipalities ("Ortschaften") which have been incorporated since 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dresden.de/media/pdf/amtsblatt/dresdner-amtsblatt-2018-37.pdf#page=29 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://www.dresden.de/media/pdf/amtsblatt/dresdner-amtsblatt-2018-37.pdf#page=29 |archive-date=9 October 2022 |url-status=live|title=Satzung zur Änderung der Hauptsatzung der Landeshauptstadt Dresden vom 4.

The population of Dresden grew to 100,000 inhabitants in 1852, making it one of the first German cities after [[Hamburg]], Berlin and [[Wrocław|Breslau]] (Wrocław) to reach that number. The population peaked at 649,252 in 1933, and dropped to 368,519 in 1945 because of World War II, during which large residential areas of the city were destroyed. After large incorporations and city restoration, the population grew to 522,532 again between 1946 and 1983.<ref>Dresden: [http://dresden.de/de/02/06/c_020_Einwohnerzahl.php Einwohnerzahl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912224206/http://dresden.de/de/02/06/c_020_Einwohnerzahl.php|date=12 September 2008}}</ref>

Since [[German reunification]], demographic development has been very unsteady. The city has struggled with migration and suburbanisation. During the 1990s the population increased to 480,000 because of several incorporations, and decreased to 452,827 in 1998. Between 2000 and 2010, the population grew quickly by more than 45,000 inhabitants (about 9.5%) due to a stabilised economy and re-urbanisation. Along with [[Munich]] and [[Potsdam]], Dresden is one of the ten fastest-growing cities in Germany.<ref name="List of cities in Germany with more than 100"/>

[[File:2022 Dresden mayoral election (2nd round).svg|thumb|350px|Results of the second round of the 2022 mayoral election]]

The first freely elected mayor after German reunification was [[Herbert Wagner (politician)|Herbert Wagner]] of the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU), who served from 1990 to 2001.

===Public institutions===
[[File:Dresden-Kultusministerium.jpg|thumb|The [[Sächsische Staatskanzlei]] (''Saxon State Chancellery'') is an institution assisting the President of the State.]]

As the capital of Saxony, Dresden is home to the [[Landtag of Saxony|Saxon state parliament]] (''Landtag'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.landtag.sachsen.de/slt_online/start_eng.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315111458/http://www.landtag.sachsen.de/slt_online/start_eng.asp|url-status=dead|title=Sächsischer Landtag|archivedate=15 March 2008|accessdate=4 April 2023}}</ref> and the ministries of the Saxon Government. The controlling [[Constitutional Court of Saxony]] is in Leipzig. The highest Saxon court in civil and [[criminal law]], is the [[Higher Regional Court of Dresden]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justiz.sachsen.de/olg/content/47.htm|title=Oberlandesgericht Dresden|access-date=25 February 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102044810/http://www.justiz.sachsen.de/olg/content/47.htm|archive-date=2 January 2008}}</ref>

Most of the Saxon state authorities are located in Dresden. Dresden is home to the Regional Commission of the [[Dresden (region)|Dresden Regierungsbezirk]], which is a controlling authority for the Saxon Government.

Like many cities in Germany, Dresden is also home to a local court, has a trade corporation and a Chamber of Industry and Trade and many subsidiaries of federal agencies (such as the Federal Labour Office or the [[Technisches Hilfswerk|Federal Agency for Technical Relief]]). It hosts some divisions of the German Customs and [[Wasser- und Schifffahrtsamt|Waterways and Shipping Office]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsa-elbe.wsv.de/Webs/WSA/Elbe/DE/WSA-Elbe/05_AnfahrtAdressen/01_WSAElbe/Elbe.html |title=Wasserstraßen- und Schifffahrtsamt Elbe |website=wsa-elbe.wsv.de |language=de |access-date=17 November 2021 |archive-date=18 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211118155633/https://www.wsa-elbe.wsv.de/Webs/WSA/Elbe/DE/WSA-Elbe/05_AnfahrtAdressen/01_WSAElbe/Elbe.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Dresden is home to a military subdistrict command, but no longer has large military units as it did in the past. Dresden is the traditional location for [[officer (armed forces)|army officer]] schooling in Germany, today carried out in the {{ill|Offizierschule des Heeres|de}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bundeswehr.de/de/organisation/heer/organisation/ausbildungskommando/offizierschule-des-heeres |title=Offizierschule des Heeres |website=bundeswehr.de |language=de |access-date=4 June 2020 |archive-date=29 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200529101934/https://www.bundeswehr.de/de/organisation/heer/organisation/ausbildungskommando/offizierschule-des-heeres |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Local affairs===
[[File:Euroluftbild de00028281.JPG|thumb|The [[Waldschlösschen Bridge]] is a subject of controversy in Dresden and other parts of Germany.]]

Local affairs in Dresden often centre around the [[urban planning|urban development]] of the city and its spaces. Architecture and the design of [[public space|public places]] is a controversial subject. Discussions about the [[Waldschlößchenbrücke]], a bridge under construction across the Elbe, received international attention because of its position across the [[Dresden Elbe Valley]] [[World Heritage Site]]. The city held a public referendum in 2005 on whether to build the bridge, prior to UNESCO expressing doubts about the compatibility between bridge and heritage. Its construction caused loss of World Heritage site status in 2009.<ref>[[UNESCO]]: [https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/265 World Heritage Committee threatens to remove Dresden Elbe Valley (Germany) from World Heritage List] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200730232811/https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/265 |date=30 July 2020 }}</ref>

In 2006, the city of Dresden sold its publicly [[subsidized housing]] organization, WOBA Dresden GmbH, to the US-based private [[investment company]] [[Fortress Investment Group]]. The city received {{Nowrap|987.1 million}} euro and paid off its remaining loans, making it the first large city in Germany to become debt-free. Opponents of the sale were concerned about Dresden's loss of control over the [[subsidized housing|subsidized housing market]].<ref>Dresden: {{cite web|url=http://www.dresden.de/index.html?node=33040|title=Saleof the WOBA Dresden GmbH|access-date=26 February 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312023055/http://www.dresden.de/index.html?node=33040|archive-date=12 March 2016}}</ref>

Dresden has been the center of groups and activities of far-right movements. Politicians and politics of [[Alternative for Germany]] (AfD) have a strong backing.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2014-12/pegida-dresden-politische-tradition|title=Pegida suits Saxony (Pegida passt nach Sachsen)|newspaper=Die Zeit |date=16 December 2014 |access-date=2 November 2019|archive-date=21 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190921204231/https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2014-12/pegida-dresden-politische-tradition|url-status=live |last1=Lühmann |first1=Michael }}</ref> Starting in October 2014, [[Pegida|PEGIDA]], a [[nationalistic]] political movement based in Dresden has been organizing weekly demonstrations against what it perceives as the [[Islamization]] of Europe at the height of the [[European migrant crisis]].

==Twin towns – sister cities==
{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}

Dresden and [[Coventry]] became twins after World War II in an act of [[Vergangenheitsbewältigung|reconciliation]], as both had suffered near-total destruction from [[Strategic bombing|massive aerial bombing]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.coventry.gov.uk/directory_record/6210/dresden_germany|title=Coventry's twin towns and cities – Dresden, Germany|website=coventry.gov.uk/|access-date=12 June 2020|archive-date=12 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200612225052/https://www.coventry.gov.uk/directory_record/6210/dresden_germany|url-status=live}}</ref> Similar symbolism occurred in 1988, when Dresden twinned with the Dutch city of [[Rotterdam]].

===Architecture===
Although Dresden is often said to be a [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] city, its architecture is influenced by more than one style. Other eras of importance are the [[Renaissance]] and [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]], as well as the contemporary styles of [[Modernism]] and [[Postmodernism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sidetracksgermany.wordpress.com/2013/05/04/dresden-architecture/|title=Dresden – Architecture|date=4 May 2013|website=Sidetracks Germany|language=en|access-date=17 November 2019|archive-date=17 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191117190740/https://sidetracksgermany.wordpress.com/2013/05/04/dresden-architecture/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Dresden has some 13,000 listed cultural monuments and eight districts under general preservation orders.<ref>Dresden: [http://www.dresden.de/en/05/040_Monument_preservation.php Monument preservation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129204608/http://www.dresden.de/en/05/040_Monument_preservation.php|date=29 January 2008}}</ref>

====Royal household====
[[File:Dresden-Zwinger.courtyard.04.JPG|thumb|[[Zwinger Palace]]]]

The [[Dresden Castle]] was the seat of the [[Royal Household|royal household]] from 1485. The wings of the building have been renewed, built upon and restored many times. Due to this integration of styles, the castle is made up of elements of the [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]] and [[Classicism|Classicist]] styles.<ref>Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden: [http://www.skd-dresden.de/en/gebaeude/residenzschloss/geschichte.html The History of the Royal Palace] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323094325/http://www.skd-dresden.de/en/gebaeude/residenzschloss/geschichte.html|date=23 March 2006}}</ref>

The [[Zwinger Palace]] is across the road from the castle. It was built on the old stronghold of the city and was converted to a centre for the royal art collections and a place to hold festivals. Its gate by the moat is surmounted by a golden crown.<ref>Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden: [http://www.skd-dresden.de/en/gebaeude/zwinger_mit_semperbau/geschichte.html History of the Zwinger and Semperbau] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927012157/http://www.skd-dresden.de/en/gebaeude/zwinger_mit_semperbau/geschichte.html|date=27 September 2007}}</ref>

Other royal buildings and ensembles:
* [[Brühl's Terrace]] was a gift to [[Heinrich, count von Brühl]], and became an ensemble of buildings above the river Elbe.
* [[Dresden Elbe Valley]] with the [[Pillnitz Castle]] and other castles

====Sacred buildings====
[[File:Canaletto - Dresden seen from the Right Bank of the Elbe, beneath the Augusts Bridge - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Bernardo Bellotto]]'s Dresden included the [[Katholische Hofkirche|Hofkirche]] during construction.]]

The [[Katholische Hofkirche|Hofkirche]] was the church of the royal household. [[Augustus II the Strong|Augustus the Strong]], who desired to be [[List of Polish monarchs|King of Poland]], converted to Catholicism, as Polish kings had to be Catholic. At that time Dresden was strictly Protestant. Augustus the Strong ordered the building of the Hofkirche, the Roman Catholic Cathedral, to establish a sign of Roman Catholic religious importance in Dresden. The church is the cathedral "Sanctissimae Trinitatis" since 1980.

====Historicism====
[[File:20070110100DR Dresden-Friedrichstadt Yenidze Weißeritzstr 3.jpg|thumb|[[Yenidze]]]]

[[Historicism (art)|Historicist]] buildings made their presence felt on the cityscape until the 1920s.

Notable examples of [[Renaissance Revival]] architecture in Dresden include the [[Albertinum]] located at Brühl's Terrace as well as the [[Saxon State Chancellery]] and the Saxon State Ministry of Finance located on the northern Elbe river banks. The [[Ehrlichsche Gestiftskirche]], constructed in 1907, was a historicist church building that was demolished in August 1951.<ref>{{cite book

The [[Villa Rosa (Dresden)|Villa Rosa]] was built in 1839 and was considered one of the most important villa buildings in Dresden, due to its [[Renaissance Revival architecture]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Helas|first=Volker|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DsDQBgAAQBAJ|title=Architektur in Dresden 1800 – 1900|date=1 December 2013|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=978-3-322-84117-9|pages=27–29|language=de}}</ref>

[[Yenidze]] is a former cigarette factory building built in the style of a mosque between 1907 and 1909.

====Modernism====
The ''Garden City of [[Hellerau]]'', at that time a suburb of Dresden, was founded in 1909. It was Germany's first [[garden city movement|garden city]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rem.routledge.com/articles/hellerau |title=Hellerau |website=Routledge Encyclopedia of Modernism |access-date=4 June 2020 |archive-date=4 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200604013034/https://www.rem.routledge.com/articles/hellerau |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1911, [[Heinrich Tessenow]] built the [[Festspielhaus Hellerau|Hellerau Festspielhaus]] (festival theatre).

Today, the Hellerau reform architecture is recognized as exemplary. In the 1990s, the garden city of Hellerau became a [[conservation area]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Entwurf zur Moderne : Hellerau: Stand Ort Bestimmung ; [Dokumentation der Fachtagung in Hellerau 1995]|date=1996|publisher=Dt.

The [[German Hygiene Museum]] (built 1928–1930) is a signal example of [[modern architecture]] in Dresden in the interwar period. The building is designed in an impressively monumental style, but employs plain façades and simple structures.

Important modernist buildings erected between 1945 and 1990 are the Centrum-Warenhaus (a large [[department store]]), representing the [[international Style (architecture)|international Style]], and the multi-purpose hall [[Kulturpalast (Dresden)|Kulturpalast]].

====Contemporary architecture====
[[File:Dresden-Kristallpalast-nigh.jpg|thumb|The locally controversial UFA-Palast]]

After 1990 and German reunification, new styles emerged. Important contemporary buildings include the [[New Synagogue, Dresden|New Synagogue]], a [[postmodern architecture|postmodern]] building with few windows, the [[Transparent Factory]], the Saxon State Parliament and the New Terrace, the UFA-Kristallpalast cinema by [[Coop Himmelb(l)au]] (one of the biggest buildings of [[Deconstructivism]] in Germany), and the [[Saxon State Library]].

[[Daniel Libeskind]] and [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]] both modified existing buildings. Foster roofed the main railway station with translucent Teflon-coated synthetics. Libeskind changed the whole structure of the [[Bundeswehr Military History Museum]] by placing a wedge through the historical arsenal building. According to Libeskind's studio, "[t]he façade's openness and transparency is intended to contrast with the opacity and rigidity of the existing building."<ref>{{cite web|last=Libeskind|first=Daniel|title=Military History Museum: Dresden, Germany|url=http://daniel-libeskind.com/projects/military-history-museum|work=Studio Daniel Libeskind|date=12 March 2014 |access-date=4 June 2020|archive-date=1 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201231527/http://daniel-libeskind.com/projects/military-history-museum|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Bridges====
Important bridges crossing the Elbe river are the [[Blaues Wunder]] bridge and the [[Augustus Bridge]].

====Statues====
[[Jean-Joseph Vinache]]'s golden [[equestrian statue]] of August the Strong, the ''Goldener Reiter'' (Golden Cavalier), is on the Neustädter Markt square. It shows August at the beginning of the Hauptstraße (Main street) on his way to Warsaw, where he was King of Poland in personal union.

Until enterprises like [[Dresdner Bank]] left Dresden in the communist era to avoid [[nationalisation]], Dresden was one of the most important German cities, an important industrial centre of the German Democratic Republic.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} The period of the [[German Democratic Republic|GDR]] until 1990 was characterized by low economic growth in comparison to western German cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Germany/Economic-unification-and-beyond|title=The East German system: Economic unification and beyond|publisher=[[Britannica]]|access-date=12 June 2024}}</ref> In 1990 Dresden had to struggle with the [[economic collapse]] of [[Soviet Union|the Soviet Union]] and the other export markets in Eastern Europe. After reunification enterprises and production sites broke down almost completely as they entered the [[social market economy]], facing competition from the Federal Republic of Germany. After 1990 a completely new [[legal system]] and currency system was introduced and infrastructure was largely rebuilt with funds from the Federal Republic of Germany. Dresden as a major urban centre has developed much faster and more consistently than most other regions in the former German Democratic Republic.

Between 1990 and 2010 the [[unemployment|unemployment rate]] fluctuated between 13% and 15%, but has decreased significantly ever since. In December 2019 the unemployment rate was 5.3%, the fourth lowest among the 15 largest cities of Germany (after [[Munich]], [[Stuttgart]] and [[Nuremberg]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://statistik.arbeitsagentur.de/Navigation/Statistik/Statistik-nach-Regionen/BA-Gebietsstruktur/Sachsen/Dresden-Nav.html?year_month=201912 |title=Arbeitsmarkt im Überblick – Berichtsmonat Dezember 2019 – Dresden, Agentur für Arbeit |website=Agentur für Arbeit |language=de |access-date=11 May 2020 |archive-date=30 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200730024804/https://statistik.arbeitsagentur.de/Navigation/Statistik/Statistik-nach-Regionen/BA-Gebietsstruktur/Sachsen/Dresden-Nav.html?year_month=201912 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2017, the [[Gross domestic product|GDP per capita]] of Dresden was 39,134 euros, the highest in Saxony.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.l-iz.de/wirtschaft/metropolregion/2019/08/Auch-beim-BIP-wird-das-Erstarken-der-Dienstleistungs-Leuchttuerme-Leipzig-und-Dresden-sichtbar-291889 |title=Auch beim BIP wird das Erstarken der Dienstleistungs-Leuchttürme Leipzig und Dresden sichtbar |website=Leipziger Internet Zeitung |date=25 August 2019 |language=de |access-date=11 May 2020 |archive-date=30 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200730030956/https://www.l-iz.de/wirtschaft/metropolregion/2019/08/Auch-beim-BIP-wird-das-Erstarken-der-Dienstleistungs-Leuchttuerme-Leipzig-und-Dresden-sichtbar-291889 |url-status=live }}</ref>
