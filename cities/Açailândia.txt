'''Açailândia''' ({{IPA|pt|ˈasajlɐ̃dʒiɐ}}) is a Brazilian [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] in the western part of [[Maranhão]] State, at an elevation of {{convert|787|ft|m|0}}. Its population in 2020 was estimated to be 113,121, making it the eighth largest city in the state. The name of the city means "land of the [[açaí]]."

The city is an important center of [[agribusiness]], the area having the largest cattle stock in Maranhão. The production of [[pig iron]] is the municipality's biggest single economic activity. Açailândia is part of the Carajas Development Corridor and the city houses many of the workers who produce [[charcoal]] in the area. The city has one of the most important railway stations on the [[Carajás Railway]] line.

Açailândia's origins are recent, lying in the construction of the Belém-Brasília highway in 1958, when the fertile lands in the vicinity of the Açailândia Creek came to the attention of those engaged in building the highway. For some time, Açailândia was considered a district of the city of [[Imperatriz]], the second largest city in the state of Maranhão.
