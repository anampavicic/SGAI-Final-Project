'''Derbent''' ({{langx|ru|Дербе́нт}}; {{langx|av|Дербенд}}; {{langx|az|Дәрбәнд|italic=no|Dərbənd}}; {{langx|lez|Кьвевар, Цал}};  {{langx|rut|Derbend}}), formerly [[romanization of Russian|romanized]] as '''Derbend''',<ref>{{Cite EB9|wstitle=Derbend|volume=7|page=105}}</ref> is a city in [[Dagestan]], [[Russia]], located on the [[Caspian Sea]]. It is the southernmost city in Russia, and it is the second-most important city of Dagestan. Derbent occupies the narrow gateway between the [[Caspian Sea]] and the [[Caucasus Mountains]] connecting the [[Eurasian Steppe]] to the north and the [[Iranian Plateau]] to the south; covering an area of {{Convert|69.63|km2|mi2|abbr=}}, with a population of roughly 120,000 residents.

Derbent claims to be the oldest city in Russia, with historical documentation dating to the [[8th century BC]], making it [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities]] in the world.<ref>[http://www.islamdag.info/story/1616 Derbent - Russia’s oldest city: 5,000 and counting] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515031716/http://www.islamdag.info/story/1616 |date=May 15, 2012 }}</ref> Due to its strategic location, over the course of history, the city changed ownership many times, particularly among the [[History of Iran|Persian]], [[Umayyad Caliphate|Arab]], [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]], [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]], and [[Shirvanshah|Shirvan]] kingdoms. In the 19th century, the city passed from [[Qajar dynasty|Persian]] into [[Russian Empire|Russian]] hands by the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] of 1813.<ref>Timothy C.

==Etymology==
Derbent is derived from [[Persian language|Persian]] "''Darband''" ({{Langx|fa|دربند|lit=Door/opening in a Barrier}}, from ''dar'' "door/gate" + ''band'' "barrier/dam", lit., "gate in the barrier"<ref>{{cite book |last2=Kosarev |first2=Aleksey N. |last3=Glantz |first3=Michael |last4=Kostianoy |first4=Andrey G. |last1=Zonn |first1=Igor S. |title=The Caspian Sea Encyclopedia |year=2010 |publisher=Springer |page=160}}</ref>), referring to the eastern-most pass in the high [[Caucasus Mountains]] (whence the putative "barrier/dam") on the beaches of the [[Caspian Sea]]. (The other pass, the [[Darial Pass]], is in the Central Caucasus Mountains, and likewise carries a Persian name, standing for "the Alan Pass/gate"{{snd}} with the [[Alans]] being the modern [[Iranic]] [[Ossetians]].)

It is often identified with the [[Gates of Alexander]], a legendary barrier supposedly built by [[Alexander the Great]] in the [[Caucasus]]. The Persian name for the city came into use at the end of the 5th or the beginning of the 6th century&nbsp;AD, when the city was re-established by [[Kavadh I of Persia|Kavadh&nbsp;I]] of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid]] dynasty of Persia, but Derbent was probably already in the Sasanian sphere of influence as a result of the victory over the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] and the conquest of [[Caucasian Albania]] by [[Shapur I]], the second shah of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid]] Persians.<ref name="DARBAND 1" /> The geographical treatise [[Šahrestānīhā ī Ērānšahr]] written in [[Middle Persian]] mentions the old name of the fortress – ''Wērōy-pahr'' (The Georgian Guard):

==History==
[[File:Derband.jpg|thumb|View of the city from the citadel of [[Naryn-Kala]], 1910s]]
Derbent's location on a narrow, three-kilometer strip of land in the [[North Caucasus]] between the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus Mountains is strategic in the entire [[Caucasus]] region. Historically, this position allowed the rulers of Derbent to control land traffic between the [[Eurasian Steppe]] and the [[Middle East]]. The only other practicable crossing of the Caucasus ridge was over the [[Darial Gorge]].

Some say that the level of the Caspian was formerly higher and that the lowering of the water level opened an invasion route that had to be fortified.<ref name="Robert H. Hewsen 2001, page 89">Robert H. Hewsen, ''Armenia: A Historical Atlas'', 2001, page 89.</ref> The chronicler [[Movses Kaghankatvatsi]] wrote about "the wondrous walls, for whose construction the Persian kings exhausted our country, recruiting architects and collecting building materials with a view of constructing a great edifice stretching between the Caucasus Mountains and the Great Eastern Sea". Derbent became a strong military outpost and harbour of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid Empire]]. During the 5th and 6th centuries, Derbent also became an important center for spreading the [[Christianity|Christian]] faith in the Caucasus.

During periods when the Sasanians were distracted by war with the [[Byzantine–Sasanian wars|Byzantines]] or protracted battles with the Hephthalites in the eastern provinces, the northern tribes succeeded in advancing into the Caucasus. The first Sasanian attempt to seal off the road along the Caspian seacoast at Darband by means of a mud-brick wall has been dated in the reign of [[Yazdegerd II]] (438–457 AD).<ref name="DARBAND 1"/>

As mentioned by the ''[[Encyclopedia Iranica]]'', ancient Iranian language elements were absorbed into the everyday speech of the population of Dagestan and Derbent especially during the Sassanian era, and many remain current.<ref name="DAGESTAN">{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dagestan |title=DAGESTAN |access-date=11 June 2015 |archive-date=April 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429175746/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dagestan |url-status=live }}</ref> In fact, a deliberate policy of “[[Persianisation|Persianizing]]” Derbent and the eastern Caucasus, in general, can be traced over many centuries, from Khosrow I to the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] shahs [[Ismail&nbsp;I]], and [[Abbas the Great|ʿAbbās the Great]].<ref name="DAGESTAN"/> According to the account in the later "Darband-nāma", after construction of the fortifications Khosrow&nbsp;I “moved much folk here from Persia”,<ref>Saidov and Shikhsaidov, pp.&nbsp;26–27.</ref> relocating about 3,000 families from the interior of Persia in the city of Derbent and neighboring villages.<ref name="DAGESTAN"/> This account seems to be corroborated by the [[Al-Andalus|Spanish Arab]] Ḥamīd Moḥammad Ḡarnāṭī, who reported in 1130 that Derbent was populated by many ethnic groups, including a large Persian-speaking population.<ref>Bol’shakov and Mongaĭt, p.&nbsp;26.</ref>

===Arab conquest===
In 643, Derbent was captured by the Arab Muslims, who called it the Gate of Gates (''Bab al-Abwab''),<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/islam-islam-caucasus-and-middle-volga |title=Islam: Islam In The Caucasus And The Middle Volga |access-date=January 31, 2023 |archive-date=January 30, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230130064441/https://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/islam-islam-caucasus-and-middle-volga |url-status=live }}</ref> following [[Muslim conquest of Persia|their invasion of Persia]]. They transformed it into an important administrative center and introduced [[Islam]] to the area. The impression of antiquity evoked by these fortifications led many Arab historians to connect them with [[Khosrow I]] and to include them among the seven wonders of the world.<ref name="DARBAND 1"/> The Darband fortress was certainly the most prominent Sasanian defensive construction in the Caucasus and could have been erected only by an extremely powerful central government.<ref name="DARBAND 1"/> Because of its strategic position on the northern branch of the [[Silk Route]], the fortress was contested by the [[Khazars]] in the course of the [[Khazar-Arab Wars]]. The Sassanids had also brought Armenians from [[Syunik (historic province)|Syunik]] to help protect the pass from invaders; as Arab rule weakened in the region at the end of the ninth century, the Armenians living there were able to establish a kingdom, which lasted until the early years of the thirteenth century.<ref>See {{in lang|hy}} Sedrak Barkhudaryan, “Դերբենդի հայ-աղվանական թագավորությունը” (“The Armenian-Caucasian Albanian Kingdom of Derbend”).

There was also a second Armenian church and two Armenian schools which served the Armenian community, which numbered about 3,000 in the census of 1913.

Excavations on the eastern side of the Caspian Sea, opposite to Derbent, revealed the [[Great Wall of Gorgan]], the eastern counterpart to the wall and fortifications of Derbent. Similar [[Sassanian]] defensive fortifications there—massive forts, garrison towns, long walls—also run from the sea to the mountains.

The Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] lived in Derbent and brought it into great repute as a seat of the arts and commerce.{{cn|date=April 2024}} According to Arab historians, Derbent, with a population exceeding 50,000, was the largest city of the 9th century in the Caucasus. In the 10th century, with the collapse of the Arab Caliphate, Derbent became the capital of an emirate. [[Emirate of Derbent]] often fought losing wars with the neighboring Christian state of [[Sarir]], allowing Sarir to manipulate Derbent's politics on occasion. Despite that, the emirate outlived its rival and continued to flourish at the time of the [[Mongol]] invasion in 1239. In the 14th century, Derbent was occupied by [[Timur]]'s armies.

===Shirvanshah era===
The [[Shirvanshah]]s dynasty existed as independent or a [[vassal]] state, from 861 until 1538; longer than any other dynasty in the [[Islamic world]]. They were renowned for their cultural achievements and geopolitical pursuits. The rulers of Shirvan, called the Shirvanshahs, had attempted, and on numerous times, succeeded, to conquer Derbend since the 18th Shirvanshah king, [[Afridun I]], was appointed as the governor of the city. Over the centuries the city changed hands often. The 21st Shirvanshah king, [[Akhsitan I]], briefly reconquered the city. However, the city was lost once again to the northern [[Kipchaks]].

After the Timurid invasion, [[Ibrahim I of Shirvan]], the 33rd Shirvanshah, managed to keep the kingdom of Shirvan independent. Ibrahim I revived Shirvan's fortunes, and through his cunning politics managed to continue without paying tribute. Furthermore, Ibrahim also greatly increased the limits of his state. He conquered the city of Derbend in 1437. The Shirvanshahs integrated the city so closely with their political structure that a new branch of the Shirvan dynasty emerged from Derbend, the Derbenid dynasty. The Derbenid dynasty, being a cadet dynasty of Shirvan, inherited the throne of Shirvan in the 15th century.

In the early 16th century, the kingdom of Shirvan was conquered by [[Shah Ismail]] of the Safavid dynasty. As Shah Ismail incorporated all the Shirvan possessions, he also inherited Derbend.

Being briefly taken by the Russians as a result of the [[Russo-Persian War (1722–23)|Persian expedition of 1722–23]] by [[Peter the Great]], the 1735 [[Treaty of Ganja]], formed by [[Imperial Russia]] and [[Safavid Iran]] (''de facto'' ruled by [[Nader Shah]]), forced Russia to return Derbent and its bastion to Iran. In 1747, Derbent became the capital of the [[Derbent Khanate]] of the same name.

During the [[Persian Expedition of 1796]], Derbent was stormed by Russian forces under General [[Valerian Zubov]], but the Russians were forced to retreat due to internal political issues,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3bt9AwAAQBAJ&q=Persian+Expedition+of+1796+derbent&pg=PA3 |title=Alexey Yermolov's Memoirs |isbn=9781105258183 |access-date=29 December 2014 |last1=Mikaberidze |first1=Alexander |year=2011 |publisher=Lulu.com |archive-date=June 25, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240625054004/https://books.google.com/books?id=3bt9AwAAQBAJ&q=Persian+Expedition+of+1796+derbent&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q=Persian%20Expedition%20of%201796%20derbent&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref> making it fall under Persian rule again. 
As a consequence of the [[Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)]] and the resulting [[Treaty of Gulistan]] of 1813, Derbent and wider [[Dagestan]] were ceded by [[Qajar Iran]] to the [[Russian Empire]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KTq2BQAAQBAJ&q=derbent+treaty+of+gulistan&pg=PA729 |title=Russia at War: From the Mongol Conquest to Afghanistan, Chechnya, and Beyond ... |isbn=9781598849486 |access-date=29 December 2014 |last1=Dowling |first1=Timothy C. |date=December 2, 2014 |archive-date=June 25, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240625054153/https://books.google.co.id/books?id=KTq2BQAAQBAJ&q=derbent+treaty+of+gulistan&pg=PA729&redir_esc=y |url-status=live }}</ref> (For background, see [[Russian conquest of the Caucasus#Caspian Coast]].)

==Geography==
The modern city is built in the [[North Caucasus]] of [[Eastern Europe]]; near the western shores of the [[Caspian Sea]], south of the Rubas River, on the slopes of the Tabasaran Mountains (part of the Bigger [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]] range). Derbent is well served by public transport, with its own harbor, a railway going south to [[Baku]], and the Baku to [[Rostov-on-Don]] road.

To the north of the town is the monument of the Kirk-lar, or forty heroes, who fell defending Dagestan against the Arabs in 728. To the south lies the seaward extremity of the [[Caucasian wall]] (fifty metres long), otherwise known as [[Alexander's Wall]], blocking the narrow pass of the Iron Gate or [[Caspian Gates]] (''Portae Athanae'' or ''Portae Caspiae''). When intact, the wall had a height of {{convert|29|ft|m|abbr=on|0|order=flip}} and a thickness of about {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on|0|order=flip}} and, with its iron gates and numerous watch-towers, defended [[Persia]]'s frontier.<ref name="EB1911"/>

Jews began to settle in Derbent in ancient times. During the Khazars' reign, they played an important part in the life of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5098-derbent |title=DERBENT - JewishEncyclopedia.com |access-date=June 9, 2015 |archive-date=January 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106121413/http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5098-derbent |url-status=live }}</ref> The Jewish traveler [[Benjamin of Tudela]] mentions Jews living in Derbent in the 12th century, and Christian traveler Wilhelm of Rubruquis writes about a Jewish community in the 13th century. The first mention of Jews in Derbent in modern times is by a German traveler, Adam Olearius, in the 17th century.

Derbent's Jewry suffered during the wars in the 18th century. Nadir Shah of Persia forced many Jews to adopt Islam. After the Russian conquest, many Jews of rural Dagestan fled to Derbent, which became the spiritual center of the [[Mountain Jews]]. The Jewish population numbered 2,200 in 1897 (15% of total population) and 3,500 in 1903. In the middle of the 20th century, Jews constituted about a third of the population of Derbent.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.haaretz.com/1.5104038 |agency=Haaretz |date=April 19, 2010 |title=Saving Another Dying Jewish Language Before It's Too Late |access-date=March 14, 2020 |archive-date=October 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201017122446/https://www.haaretz.com/1.5104038 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1989, there were 13,000 Jews in the city, but most emigrated after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

{{main|Fortifications of Derbent}}
[[File:Крепость Нарын-Кала. Дербент.jpg|thumb|Sassanid Fortress [[Naryn-Kala]] (Derbent)]]
Derbent resembles a huge museum and has magnificent mountains and shore nearby, and therefore possesses much touristic potential, further increased by [[UNESCO]]'s classification of the citadel, ancient city and fortress as a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2003; however, instability in the region has halted development.

The current fortification and walls were built by the Persian [[Sassanian Empire]] as a defensive structure against hostile nomadic people in the north, and continuously repaired or improved by later Arab, Mongol, Timurid, Shirvan, and Iranian kingdoms until the early course of the 19th century, as long as its military function lasted. The fortress was built under the direction of the Sassanid emperor [[Khosrow I|Khosrow (Chosroes)&nbsp;I]].<ref name="The Jews of Khazatia"/>

A large portion of the walls and several watchtowers still remain in reasonable shape. The walls, reaching to the sea, date from the 6th century, [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid dynasty]] period.
