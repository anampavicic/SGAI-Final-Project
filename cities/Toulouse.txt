The Garonne Valley was a central point for trade between the Pyrenees, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic since at least the [[European Iron Age|Iron Age]]. The historical name of the city, ''Tolosa'' (Τολῶσσα in [[Greek language|Greek]], and of its inhabitants, the ''Tolosates'', first recorded in the 2nd century BC), is of unknown meaning or origin, possibly from [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] or [[Iberian language|Iberian]],<ref>[[Albert Dauzat]] et [[Charles Rostaing]], ''Dictionnaire étymologique des noms de lieux en France'', 2nd ed., Librairie Guénégaud 1978.</ref> but it has also been connected to the name of the [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] [[Volcae Tectosages]],<ref>''Le Nom de Toulouse'' de Pierre Moret, 1996, Université Toulouse le Mirail – Toulouse II, p. 11; ''Histoire de Toulouse'', 1974, p. 11.</ref> or to the [[wikt:Toulouse|same root]] as Irish ''[https://www3.smo.uhi.ac.uk/sengoidelc/duil-belrai/lorg.php?facal=tulach&tairg=Old-Irish+headword&seorsa=Gaidhlig tulach]'' or Welsh ''[https://glosbe.com/cy/en/twlch twlch]'', (little hill).

====Toulouse refounded by the Romans on the banks of the Garonne====
Tolosa enters the historical period in the 2nd century BC, when it became a [[Roman Republic|Roman]] military outpost. After the conquest of [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]], it was developed as a Roman city in [[Gallia Narbonensis]]. Under the reign of Emperor [[Augustus]] and thanks to the [[Pax Romana]], the Romans moved the city a few kilometres from the hills where it was an ''[[oppidum]]'' to the banks of the Garonne, which were more suitable for trade.<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019">Collective work directed by Jean-Marc Olivier and Rémy Pech: "''Histoire de Toulouse et de la métropole''". Éditions Privat, 2019.</ref>

In the second half of the 1st century, the emperor [[Domitian]] distinguished Toulouse by placing it under the patronage of the goddess [[Athena|Pallas Athena]], so that the Latin poets [[Martial]], [[Ausonius]] and [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] called the city ''Palladia Tolosa'' (Palladian Toulouse), a term that was still used in the Renaissance and even today when the city is presented as propitious to the arts and letters.<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/>

Around the year 250, Toulouse was marked by the martyrdom of [[Saturnin]], the first bishop of Toulouse. This episode illustrates the difficult beginnings of Christianity in Roman Gaul.<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/>

====Capital of the Visigothic kingdom====
In the 5th century, Toulouse fell to the [[Visigothic kingdom]] and became one of its major cities, even serving as its [[Visigothic Kingdom#Kingdom of Toulouse|capital]], before it fell to the [[Francia|Franks]] under [[Clovis I|Clovis]] in 507 during the [[Battle of Vouillé]].<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/> From that time, Toulouse was the capital of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] within the Frankish realm.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mAgDwx4pS0QC&pg=PA59| title=The Capetians: Kings of France 987-1328| page=59| isbn=9780826435149| last1=Bradbury| first1=Jim| date=27 February 2007| publisher=Bloomsbury}}</ref>

====Under Frankish rule====
In 721, [[Odo the Great|Duke Odo]] of [[Aquitaine]] defeated an invading [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Muslim]] army at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]]. Many Arab chroniclers consider that Odo's victory was the real stop to Muslim expansion into [[Christendom|Christian Europe]], incursions of the following years being simple raids without real will of conquest (including the one that ended with [[Charles Martel]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Tours]], also called the Battle of Poitiers).<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k415420b/f39. |title=Recueil de l'Académie des jeux floraux |year=1842}}</ref>

The Frankish conquest of [[Septimania]] followed in the 750s, and a quasi-independent [[County of Toulouse]] emerged within the Carolingian sub-kingdom of Aquitaine by the late 8th century. The [[Battle of Toulouse (844)|Battle of Toulouse of 844]], pitting [[Charles the Bald]] against [[Pepin II of Aquitaine]], was key in the Carolingian Civil War.<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/>

Charlemagne had created the county of Toulouse in 778 to guard the border of Muslim Spain, but the disintegration of the kingdom of Aquitaine and the weakness of royal power in the following centuries led to the ''de facto'' independence of the county of Toulouse and many provinces.

In the 11th and 12th centuries, southern France was still steeped in Latin culture. Unlike the north of France, justice followed written Roman law and the nobles were highly educated. This was the time of the [[troubadours]] who wrote their poetry in [[Occitania|Occitan]] (called "Provençal" at the time), then one of the most sophisticated languages in Europe. Like the other great lords of the [[Southern France|Midi]], the counts of Toulouse maintained and favoured these poets, this is how Count [[Raymond V, Count of Toulouse|Raymond V]] employed for some time the famous [[Bernart de Ventadorn|Bernard de Ventadour]], expert in singing [[courtly love]].<ref name="Guide_Michelin">''Pyrénées Toulouse Gers'', Le Guide Vert Michelin, 2016.</ref>

In 1096, [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]], left with his army at the call of the [[Pope Urban II]] to join the [[First Crusade]], of which he was one of the main leaders.<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Jotischky|first=Andrew|title=Crusading and the Crusader States|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0-582-41851-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rTUlDwAAQBAJ}}</ref> This exodus of its warriors and nobles, reinforced by the creation of the faraway [[County of Tripoli]] by Raymond IV at the beginning of the 12th century, weakened the city militarily as well as the ascendancy that its counts had over it. The Duke [[William IX of Aquitaine]] challenged the possession of the city on the grounds that it should have been inherited by his wife [[Philippa, Countess of Toulouse|Philippa]] (daughter of the [[William IV, Count of Toulouse|previous count of Toulouse]], whereas Raymond IV was only his brother). More than 50 years later his granddaughter [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] still claimed the inheritance in vain.<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/>

In the 12th century the city left its Roman limits and a new district developed around the [[Basilica of Saint-Sernin, Toulouse|church of Saint-Sernin]]: the ''Bourg''. The church of Saint-Sernin was famous and revered for its many relics, and the chapter of its canons, which had possessions as far away as Spain, was powerful enough to free itself from the control of the bishop of Toulouse. This dissent had important local political repercussions, making the ''Bourg'' in practice a separate district from the city. In 1152, the notables of Toulouse took advantage of a weakening of the county power to obtain for their city a great autonomy, they created a municipal body of consuls, called [[capitoul]]s in Toulouse, to lead the city. The ''Bourg'', which had only a quarter of the inhabitants of Toulouse, obtained as many capitouls as the rest of the city.<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/> Economically, Toulouse, which was at the center of a large cereal-growing plain, was distinguished by its numerous mills that took advantage of the force of the Garonne, among which the [[Bazacle Milling Company]] was the first recorded European joint-stock company.

==== The fight against Catharism and its various aspects ====
At the beginning of the thirteenth century the County of Toulouse was caught up in [[Albigensian Crusade|another crusade]] that would last twenty years (1209-1229), of which it was the target this time. The reason for this was the development of [[Catharism]] in the south of France, which the [[Pope Innocent III]] wanted to eradicate by all possible means.<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/>

After an initial victory of the crusaders led by [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] who defeated the combined forces of Count [[Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse|Raymond VI of Toulouse]] and King [[Peter II of Aragon]] at the [[Battle of Muret]], the following years saw the fate of the county of Toulouse swing alternately in favour of one party or the other. Finally, a late intervention by King [[Louis VIII of France]] in 1226 tipped the balance in favour of the crusaders, resulting in the submission of Count [[Raymond VII, Count of Toulouse|Raymond VII]] to the French Crown and the end of the independence of the County of Toulouse.<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/>

But beyond the military crusade, this struggle took on several important aspects for the city of Toulouse:
* The [[Dominican Order]] was founded in Toulouse by [[Saint Dominic]] in 1215. Spanish priest Dominic de Guzmán wanted to convert the Cathars to Catholicism peacefully, by preaching and by living a poor and exemplary life. After years of criss-crossing the [[Lauraguais]] countryside between Carcassonne and Toulouse, he changed his method and decided to preach in town. In 1215 he settled in Toulouse and founded a [[mendicant order]] which, within a few decades, would cover Europe with hundreds of convents: The Order of Preachers, also known as the Dominicans.<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/>
* Under the impulse of the bishop of Toulouse, [[Folquet de Marselha|Foulques]], an original and austere architectural style was born in Toulouse, designed to break with the display of luxury of the Catholic church which drove the faithful towards the Cathars: the [[Southern French Gothic]].<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/>
* In the [[Treaty of Paris (1229)|Treaty of Paris of 1229]], Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France. The county's sole heiress [[Joan, Countess of Toulouse|Joan]] was engaged to [[Alphonse, Count of Poitiers]], a younger brother of [[Louis IX of France]]. The marriage became legal in 1241, but it remained childless and so after Joan's death, the county fell to the [[Crown of France]] by inheritance.<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/>
* Another consequence of the Treaty of Paris was the creation of the [[University of Toulouse]], established on the [[University of Paris|Parisian model]], strongly sponsored by the pope and intended as a means to dissolve the heretic movement.<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/><ref>{{cite book |last1= Blackburn|first1= William Maxwell|date= 1879|title= History of the Christian Church from Its Origin to the Present Time|language= en|location= |publisher= Cranston and Stowe|page= 309}}</ref>
* Also in 1229, the [[Council of Toulouse]] was held, which laid the foundations for the long period of [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisition]] that was to eradicate Catharism in the region after the military victory of the Crusade.<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/>

===Kingdom of France===
In 1271, Joan of Toulouse and her husband Alphonse of Poitiers died without heirs. Toulouse, which since the treaty of 1229 had been subordinate to the [[kingdom of France]], no longer had a count and was annexed to [[Crown lands of France#Reign of Philip III|the royal domain]].<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/> The installation of numerous royal officers and the development of trade and crafts, which favoured the social ascension of merchants, renewed the city's elites. In 1298, [[Philip IV of France|King Philip the Fair]] greatly facilitated the possibility of ennobling the capitouls, whose council, renewed every year, was increasingly made up of rich merchants.<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/>

The first half of the 14th century was a prosperous period, despite the dismemberment in 1317 of the very large bishopric of Toulouse (which lost two thirds of its area and a large part of its income, a loss only partially compensated by its elevation to the rank of archbishopric), and the episode of the [[Shepherds' Crusade (1320)|Shepherds' Crusade]] which brought a [[pogrom]] against Toulouse's Jewish population in 1320.<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/03/is-it-time-for-the-jews-to-leave-europe/386279/." |title=Goldberg, Jeffrey. "Is it Time for the Jews to Leave Europe?" The Atlantic. April 2015. |website=[[The Atlantic]] |date=16 March 2015 |access-date=21 March 2015}}</ref> In 1335, Toulouse had between 35,000 and 40,000 inhabitants.<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/>

In 1323, the ''[[Consistori del Gay Saber]]'' was created in Toulouse to preserve the [[Lyric poetry|lyric art]] of the [[troubadour]]s by organizing a poetry contest; and Toulouse became the centre of [[Occitania|Occitan]] literary culture for the following centuries. The '' Consistori'' is considered to be the oldest literary society in Europe, at the origin of one of the most sophisticated [[Leys d'amor|treatise]] on grammar and rhetoric of the Middle Ages, and in 1694 it was transformed into the Royal Academy of the [[Floral Games]] (''Académie des Jeux Floraux''), still active today, by king [[Louis XIV]].<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/>

The 14th century also saw a significant increase in the influence of the University of Toulouse, particularly following the move of the papacy from Rome to Avignon. Many law graduates from the University of Toulouse had brilliant careers in the [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon curia]], several became cardinals and three became popes: [[Pope John XXII|John XXII]], [[Pope Innocent VI|Innocent VI]] and [[Pope Urban V|Urban V]]. These powerful prelates financed the establishment of colleges in the university towns of southern France, not only Toulouse but also Montpellier, Cahors and Avignon.<ref name="Cyril Eugene Smith">Cyril Eugene Smith: "University of Toulouse in the middle ages, its origins and growth to 1500 AD." Ed. The Marquette university press, 1958.</ref>

The [[Black Death]] in 1348, then the [[Hundred Years' War]] caused a major crisis that lasted until the following century.<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/> Despite strong immigration, the population lost more than 10,000 inhabitants in 70 years. By 1405 Toulouse had only 19,000 people.<ref>Biraben, Jean-Noël. ''La Population de Toulouse au XIVe et au XVe siècles [Pierre Wolff, Les Estimes toulousaines du XIVe et XVe siècles]''. Journal des savants, 1964, p. 300.</ref> In these hardships, the city was the key stronghold of the French defence in the south of France during the worst years of the Hundred Years' War, when the English troops from Aquitaine had taken Montauban and only Toulouse remained as an obstacle to their conquest of southern France. This military threat to the city and especially to the surrounding countryside was not conducive to its development, despite the strengthening of ties with the royalty that it entailed.<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/>

In 1369, pope [[Urban V]] attributed to the Dominican church of the [[Church of the Jacobins|Jacobins of Toulouse]] the bones of the Dominican theologian [[Thomas Aquinas|Saint Thomas Aquinas]], perhaps to honor the city that had been the cradle of the Dominican order at the beginning of the previous century.<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/>

The political and economic situation improved by the middle of the 15th century.<ref>Brumont, Francis. ''La commercialisation du pastel toulousain (1350–1600)''. Privat presse, 1994, p. 27.</ref> In 1443 King [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] established the second [[Parlement of Toulouse|parliament]] of France after that of Paris. Reinforcing its place as an administrative and judicial center, the city grew richer, participating in the trade of [[Bordeaux wine]] with England, as well as cereals and textiles. A major source of income was the production and export of ''pastel'', a blue dye made from [[Isatis tinctoria|woad]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.terredepastel.com/le-pastel// |title=terredepastel.com |publisher=terredepastel.com |access-date=3 May 2015}}</ref>

Toulouse suffered several fires, but it was in 1463 that the Great Fire of Toulouse broke out, ravaging the city for fifteen days. After this dramatic event, King Louis XIII exempted the city from taxes for 100 years. The capitouls issued municipal decrees favouring the use of brick in buildings, rather than excessively flammable wood or cob.<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/>

In the 16th century, and until 1562, the economy of Toulouse experienced a golden age: its Parliament made it the judicial capital of a large part of southern France, and the city became the first European centre for the trade in woad, the only blue dye then known in Europe which was very much in demand in the textile industry at the time. Its humanist milieu developed thanks to its university and parliament, which trained and attracted intellectual elites. The wealth generated by this culturally and economically dynamic environment is the source of the superb [[Renaissance architecture of Toulouse|Renaissance mansions]] in Toulouse. In 1550 the population of the city made it the second or third largest city in France. It was estimated to have 50,000 inhabitants, a figure it would not regain until the 18th century.<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/><ref name="Toulouse-renaissance">Collective work directed by Pascal Julien, «catalogue de l'exposition Toulouse Renaissance» ("Toulouse Renaissance exhibition catalogue"), Somogy éditions d'art, 2018.</ref>

In 1562, the [[French Wars of Religion]] began and Toulouse became an ultra-Catholic stronghold in a predominantly Protestant region, the era of economic prosperity came to an end. The governor of Languedoc, [[Henri II de Montmorency]], who had rebelled, was executed in 1632 in the [[Capitole de Toulouse|Capitole]] in the presence of King [[Louis XIII]] and [[Cardinal Richelieu]].<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/>

In 1666, [[Pierre-Paul Riquet]] started the construction of the [[Canal du Midi]] which links Toulouse to the Mediterranean Sea, and is considered one of the greatest construction works of the 17th century. Completed in 1681, the canal stimulated the economy of Toulouse by promoting the export of cereals and the import of olive oil, wine and other goods from the Mediterranean regions.<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/>

In the 18th century, Toulouse was a provincial capital that prided itself on its royal academies (the only city in France, along with Paris, to have three royal academies), but sometimes seemed far removed from the debates of ideas that agitated the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/><ref>Michel Taillefer, "''Toulouse au temps des Lumières : L'Académie des Sciences, Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres de Toulouse au XVIIIe siècle''".</ref> A famous example illustrates this backwardness of Toulouse mentalities of the time: in 1762 its powerful parliament sentenced [[Jean Calas]] to death. The philosopher [[Voltaire]] then accused the Parlement of Toulouse of religious intolerance (Calas was a Protestant), gave the affair a European repercussion and succeeded in having the judgment of the parliament quashed by the King's Council, which did much damage to the reputation of the parliament. It was on this occasion that Voltaire published one of his major philosophical works: his famous [[Treatise on Tolerance]].

With the [[French Revolution]] of 1789 and the reform or suppression of all royal institutions, Toulouse lost much of its power and influence: until then the capital of the vast province of Languedoc, with a parliament ruling over an even larger territory, the city then found itself simply at the head of the single small department of [[Haute-Garonne]].<ref name="Histoire de Toulouse 2019"/>

===19th century===
On 10 April 1814, four days after [[Napoleon]]'s surrender of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] to the nations of the [[Sixth Coalition]] (a fact that the two armies involved were not yet aware of), the [[Battle of Toulouse (1814)|Battle of Toulouse]] pitted the Hispanic-British troops of Field Marshal [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] against the French troops of Napoleonic Marshal [[Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult|Soult]], who, although they managed to resist, were forced to withdraw. Toulouse was thus the scene of the last Franco-British battle on French territory.<ref>Anne Le Stang, ''Histoire de Toulouse illustrée'', {{p.|150}}.</ref>

Unlike most large French cities, there was no real industrial revolution in 19th century Toulouse.{{cn|date=December 2023}} The most important industries were the gunpowder factory, to meet military needs, and the tobacco factory. In 1856 the railway arrived in Toulouse and the city was modernised: the ramparts were replaced by large boulevards, and major avenues such as the ''rue d'Alsace-Lorraine'' and the ''rue de Metz'' opened up the historic centre.

In 1875, a flood of the Garonne devastated more than 1,000 houses and killed 200 people. It also destroyed all the bridges in Toulouse, except the [[Pont Neuf, Toulouse|Pont-Neuf]].<ref>Spécial météo à Toulouse, ''L'Express'', nº 2948, semaine du 3 au 9 janvier 2008, ''Les crues les plus dévastatrices'', p.

===20th and 21st centuries===
[[File:Lignes_Aeriennes_Latécoére_(Latécoére-Toulouse).jpg|thumb|The epic of l'[[Aéropostale (aviation)|Aéropostale]] has written some of the most beautiful pages in the history of aviation in Toulouse.]]
[[World War I]] brought to Toulouse (geographically sheltered from enemy attacks) chemical industries as well as aviation workshops ([[Pierre-Georges Latécoère|Latécoère]], [[Dewoitine]]), which launched the city's aeronautical construction tradition and gave birth after the war to the famous ''[[Aéropostale (aviation)|Aéropostale]]'', a pioneering airmail company based in Toulouse and whose epics were popularised by the novels of writers such as [[Joseph Kessel]] and [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]] (himself an ''Aéropostale'' pilot).<ref>Benoît Heimermann and Olivier Margot: ''L'aéropostale: la fabuleuse épopée de Mermoz, Saint-Exupéry, Guillaumet'', Arthaud editor, 1994.</ref><ref name="PetiteHistoireDeToulouse">Jean-Marie Pailler, Annick Thomas and Jack Thomas: ''Petite Histoire de Toulouse'', Éditions Cairn, 2017.</ref>

In the 1920s and 1930s the rise of the Toulouse population was increased by the arrival of Italians and Spaniards fleeing the fascist regimes of their country. Then, in the early 1960s, French repatriates from [[Algeria]] swelled the city's population.<ref name="PetiteHistoireDeToulouse"/>

In 1963, Toulouse was chosen to become one of the country's eight "balancing Metropolis", regaining a position among the country's major cities that it had always had, but lost in the 19th century. The French state then encouraged the city's specialisation in aeronautics and space activities, sectors that had experienced strong growth in recent decades, fueling economic and population growth.<ref name="PetiteHistoireDeToulouse"/>

On 21 September 2001, an [[Toulouse chemical factory explosion|explosion]] occurred at the AZF fertiliser factory, causing 31 deaths, about 30 seriously wounded and 2,500 light casualties.

In 2016, a territorial reform made Toulouse the regional [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of [[Occitania (administrative region)|Occitanie]], the second largest region in metropolitan France, giving it a role commensurate with its past as a provincial capital among the most important in France.<ref name="PetiteHistoireDeToulouse"/>

Fueled by booming aerospace and high-tech industries, the Toulouse metropolitan area's population grew by 57.3% between the 1990 and 2020 censuses (within its 2020 borders), which means +1.52% per year on average during those 30 years, compared with a growth of 15.3% for [[metropolitan France]] between 1990 and 2020, i.e. +0.48% per year. This was the second-highest population growth of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants (only the [[Montpellier]] metropolitan area grew more than Toulouse between 1990 and 2019).

The Toulouse metropolitan area reached 1,470,899 inhabitants in January 2020, and stood as the 5th most populated metropolitan area in France, behind the metropolitan areas of Paris, Lyon, Marseille, and Lille, but ahead of the metropolitan area of Bordeaux, which the Toulouse metropolitan area passed in population in the 1990s.

===Toulouse Métropole===
[[File:Capitole Toulouse - Le donjon.jpg|thumb|Former tower of the city archives and meeting place of the capitouls, 1525-1530]]
{{Main|Toulouse Métropole}}
The Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse (''Communauté d'agglomération du Grand Toulouse'') was created in 2001 to better coordinate transport, infrastructure and economic policies between the city of Toulouse and its immediate independent suburbs. It succeeds a previous district which had been created in 1992 with fewer powers than the current council. It combines the city of Toulouse and 24 independent ''communes'', covering an area of {{convert|380|km²|0|abbr=on}}, totalling a population of 583,229 inhabitants (as of 1999 census), 67% of whom live in the city of Toulouse proper. As of February 2004 estimate, the total population of the Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse was 651,209 inhabitants, 65.5% of whom live in the city of Toulouse. Due to local political feuds, the Community of Agglomeration only hosts 61% of the population of the metropolitan area, the other independent suburbs having refused to join in. Since 2009, the Community of agglomeration has become an urban community (in French: communauté urbaine). This has become a [[métropole]] in 2015, spanning 37 communes with 806,503 inhabitants in 2020 census.<ref name=decret>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000029497463|title=Décret n° 2014-1078 du 22 septembre 2014 portant création de la métropole dénommée " Toulouse Métropole " &#124; Legifrance|access-date=30 June 2017}}</ref>

[[File:Jean-Luc Moudenc, maire (LR) de Toulouse.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Luc Moudenc]], mayor of Toulouse]]

One of the major political figures in Toulouse was [[Dominique Baudis]], the [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of Toulouse between 1983 and 2001, member of the centrist [[Union for French Democracy|UDF]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Laval |first=Gilbert |title=Toulouse, un legs difficile pour Douste-Blazy.

(Pierre Baudis was mayor from 1971 to 1983.)

Baudis tried to strengthen the international role of Toulouse (such as its [[Airbus]] operations), as well as revive the cultural heritage of the city. The Occitan cross, flag of [[Languedoc]] and symbol of the counts of Toulouse, was chosen as the new flag of the city, instead of the traditional coat of arms of Toulouse (which included the [[fleur de lis]] of the French monarchy). Many cultural institutions were created, in order to attract foreign expatriates and emphasise the city's past. For example, monuments dating from the time of the [[History of Toulouse|counts of Toulouse]] were restored, the city's symphonic concert hall (''Halle aux Grains'') was refurbished, a city theater was built, a Museum of Modern Art was founded, the [[Bemberg Foundation]] (European paintings and [[Bronze sculpture|bronzes]] from the [[Renaissance]] to the 20th century) was established, a huge pop music concert venue (''Zénith'', the largest in France outside Paris) was built, the space museum and educational park ''[[Cité de l'Espace]]'' was founded, etc.

To deal with growth, major housing and transportation projects were launched. Line A of the [[Rapid transit|underground]] was opened in 1993, and line B opened in 2007. The creation of a system of underground car parking structures in Toulouse city centre was sharply criticised by the [[The Greens (France)|Green Party]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bonjourlafrance.com/france-city/toulouse-france/toulouse-politics.htm |title=Toulouse politics information |publisher=Bonjourlafrance.com |access-date=1 October 2013 |archive-date=28 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828091616/http://www.bonjourlafrance.com/france-city/toulouse-france/toulouse-politics.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2000, Dominique Baudis was at the zenith of his popularity, with approval rates of 85%.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} He announced that he would not run for a fourth (6-year) term in 2001. He explained that with 3 terms he was already the longest-serving mayor of Toulouse since the [[French Revolution]]; he felt that change would be good for the city, and that the number of terms should be limited. He endorsed [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]], then [[Union for French Democracy|UDF]] mayor of [[Lourdes]] as his successor. Baudis has since been appointed president of the CSA (''[[Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel]]'') in Paris, the French equivalent of the American [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]].

Philippe Douste-Blazy narrowly won in the 2001 elections, which saw the left making its best showing in decades. Douste-Blazy had to deal with a reinvigorated political opposition, as well as with the dramatic explosion of the [[AZF (factory)|AZF]] plant in late 2001.

In March 2004, he entered the national government, and left Toulouse in the hands of his second-in-command [[Jean-Luc Moudenc]], elected mayor by the municipal council. In March 2008, Moudenc was defeated by the Socialist Party's candidate [[Pierre Cohen]].

At the next elections in 2014 Moudenc defeated Cohen in a rematch to re-take the job with more than 52% of the votes, and he was re-elected with almost the same score in 2020.

==Sights and architecture==
[[File:Foraine brick en.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Format differences between a "foraine" brick and a regular brick]]

Classified "City of Art and History", Toulouse has a very rich architectural heritage ranging from large Romanesque and Gothic churches to neo-classical facades such as that of the Capitole, to the prestigious mansions of the Renaissance. This ancient heritage is mainly enclosed within the 220 hectares of the city's inner boulevard (one of the largest protected urban areas in France).{{cn|date=December 2023}}

Almost all the buildings of the historical centre were made with the traditional building material of the region: the "foraine" brick that has earned the city the nickname of ''Ville rose'' (Pink city). Medieval heir to the [[Roman brick]], the "foraine" brick is characterised by its large dimensions, its flat appearance and its colour ranging from orange/pink to red.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/on1241184281 |title=A cultural history of color |date=2021 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4742-7373-2 |editor-last=Wharton |editor-first=David |location=London, UK ; New York, NY, USA |oclc=on1241184281 |editor-last2=Biggam |editor-first2=C.

White stone is also present in smaller quantities. As there were no stone quarries near Toulouse, it was transported from the [[Pyrenees]] via the Garonne river and was for a long time rare and therefore expensive, considered in Toulouse as a luxury material.{{cn|date=December 2023}} However, it is enough to give Toulouse's architecture one of its characteristics: red/white polychromy.{{cn|date=December 2023}}

===Romanesque architecture (11th-12th c.)===
[[File:Mur roman.jpg|thumb|Remains of a Romanesque brick wall in the ''Jardin des Plantes'']]

The Romanesque architecture of Toulouse is largely dominated by the presence of the Basilica of Saint-Sernin, one of the most important churches of its time in Europe, and fortunate enough to keep its Romanesque character virtually intact.

====Basilica of Saint-Sernin====
[[Saint-Sernin Basilica|Basilica of Saint-Sernin]], part of the [[Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France|Way of Saint James]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], was also in itself a major place of pilgrimage. It is one of the two largest surviving [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] churches in Europe.<ref group="note">[[Speyer cathedral]] is slightly larger, but unlike Saint-Sernin this church has been largely destroyed and rebuilt in its history, so the question of which is the largest remaining Romanesque church depends on the criteria chosen as to Romanesque character.</ref> With more than two hundred relics (including that of [[Saturnin|Saint Saturnin]] who gave his name to the church), many of which were donated by [[Charlemagne]] to the shrine that preceded the present church, Saint-Sernin is the church with the most relics after Saint Peter of Rome.<ref name="PatrimoineRevele">Jean-Claude Jaffé, "''Toulouse, le patrimoine révélé''". Éditions Privat, 2013.</ref>

Conceived from the outset as a gigantic reliquary, the church was mainly built at the end of the 11th century and at the beginning of the 12th century to welcome the crowds of pilgrims, its double-sided aisles and the ambulatory surrounding the apse make it the archetype of the great pilgrimage church, where pilgrims could make the circuit around the church and were able to stop for meditation and prayer at the apsidal chapels of the transept and the radiating chapels of the choir. The church is also particularly noteworthy for the quality of its Romanesque sculptures, including numerous capitals and the historiated tympanum of the Miègeville gate, one of the first of its kind.<ref name="SeeYouInToulouse">Quitterie and Daniel Cazes, "See you in Toulouse". Éditions Sud-Ouest, 2018.</ref>

===Gothic architecture (13th c.-early 16th c.)===

====Southern French Gothic: a militant religious architecture====
{{see also|Southern French Gothic}}
[[file:Toulouse - Jacobins et ND du Taur.jpg|thumb|Southern French Gothic bell towers and churches]]
At the beginning of the 13th century, the Catholic clergy of the South of France, seeing a growing number of the faithful turning to the [[Catharism]] which advocated a more pious austerity, showed the will to correct the defects of the Catholic Church which indulged in luxury. Under the impulse of the bishop of Toulouse, [[Folquet de Marselha|Foulques]], an austere and militant architectural style was born with the reconstruction of the Cathedral of Toulouse: the '''Southern French Gothic'''. Conceived according to an ideal of poverty and humility to bring the faithful together in a single, vast nave to facilitate preaching, this architectural style then developed during the 13th century in the grand [[Mendicant orders|mendicant convents]] of the city, before spreading in the 14th century to a large number of churches and cathedrals in the region.<ref name="DossierVMF">Caroline de Barrau, "''Le gothique toulousain, un art militant''", in magazine VMF of march 2010 (''revue des Vieilles Maisons Françaises''), in French.</ref>

Several churches or convents in Toulouse belong to this architectural trend, but two of them are particularly symbolic and remarkable:

* [[Toulouse Cathedral|Cathedral of Saint-Étienne]] (Saint Stephen) is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toulouse]]. Its construction, which was mainly done at the beginning and then at the end of the 13th century, reflects the history of this decisive century which saw the city lose its independence to become a French city. The single nave is the first example of Southern French Gothic, at 19 metres wide it probably was at its completion the widest in Western Europe (1210-1220). The higher choir that adjoins it was built in the Gothic style of northern France shortly after the city became part of the Crown of France in 1271.<ref name="DossierVMF"/>
* [[Church of the Jacobins|Convent of the Jacobins]] (13th century / early 14th century) was the Dominican convent of Toulouse and is considered to be, together with the [[Albi Cathedral]], the pinnacle of Southern French Gothic architecture.<ref name="UnescoAlbi">{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/uploads/nominations/1337.pdf|title=''La Cité épiscopale d'Albi'' (Episcopal City of Albi).

====Gothic civil architecture====
Toulouse has preserved about thirty Gothic stair towers (plus a dozen Renaissance or later towers),<ref>Jean-François Gourdou, "''Tours tolosanes''", Éditions Privat, 2008.</ref> the remains of private mansions (called ''[[hôtel particulier|hôtels particuliers]]'') from the Middle Ages and the early 16th century. Often hidden in courtyards, some of these towers are high enough to exceed their function of serving the floors and display the ambition of their owners.

At a time when most of the houses in Toulouse were built in wood or [[Cob (material)|cob]], the brick construction of these towers and ''hôtels'' also testifies to their quality.

===Renaissance architecture (16th c.-early 17th c.)===
{{Main|Renaissance architecture of Toulouse}}
In the 16th century, Toulouse experienced a golden age coinciding with the Renaissance in France. The [[Isatis tinctoria|woad trade]] (''pastel'') brought merchants of international stature to the city, and the [[Parlement of Toulouse]] made the city the judicial capital of a large part of the south of France. These wealthy elites had private mansions built, remarkable for their architecture inspired by architectural treatises such as those of [[Sebastiano Serlio|Serlio]], [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]] or [[Vitruvius]], but also by the royal castles of the [[Châteaux of the Loire Valley|Loire Valley]] and the [[History of Île-de-France|Île-de-France]].<ref name="Toulouse-renaissance"/>

Renowned for the quality of their architecture, the private mansions of the Toulouse Renaissance that have survived to the present day were built over more than a century (around 1515–1620) by reputed architects such as Louis Privat, [[Nicolas Bachelier]], Dominique Bachelier or [[Pierre Souffron]]. The most famous of these ''hôtels'' are those of [[Hôtel d'Assézat|Assézat]], [[Hôtel de Bernuy|Bernuy]], [[Hôtel du Vieux-Raisin|Vieux-Raisin]] or [[Hôtel de Bagis|Clary]]...<ref name="Toulouse-renaissance"/>

===17th century architecture===

====17th century religious architecture====
The [[French Wars of Religion]], which started in the second half of the 16th century, brought to the city many religious orders who came to seek asylum in this solid Catholic bastion. They had baroque churches built in the 17th century: among them, the [[Carthusians|Order of Carthusians]], expelled by the Protestants from the region of Castres, founded the church of Saint-Pierre des Chartreux, the order of the [[Discalced Carmelites]] built the church of Saint-Exupère, the [[Confraternity of penitents|blue penitents]] founded the church of Saint-Jérôme and the order of [[Carmelite nuns]] created a convent of which a remarkable painted chapel remains.

====17th century civil architecture====
After the Renaissance, the decorations in civil architecture became less numerous and ostentatious, due to the importance given to the moderation of the architectural structures and the development of interior decorations. The play of colours (between brick and stone) and reliefs (bossing) were less costly and nevertheless effective solutions for livening up facades. The 17th century is the century that gave Toulouse the largest number of its private mansions, most of them built by members of parliament.<ref name="HotelsDeToulouse">Guy Ahlsell de Toulza, Louis Peyrusse, Bruno Tollon, «Hôtels et demeures de Toulouse et du Midi toulousain» ("Hotels and residences in Toulouse and the region of Toulouse"), Editor Daniel Briand, 1997.</ref>

===18th century architecture===
In the 18th century Toulouse made its living from its Parliament and from the wheat and corn trade, which was boosted by the creation of the [[Canal du Midi]] at the end of the previous century. Among the major architectural achievements, the most notable were undoubtedly the construction of the quays of the Garonne and the new facade of the [[Capitole de Toulouse|Capitole]] (1750-1760), designed by architect [[Guillaume Cammas]].

In the last third of the 18th century, the ever increasing influence of the Parisian model meant that red brick was no longer popular: the city facades were then whitewashed to imitate stone. This is why nowadays, even though the white paint has generally been removed, there are walls with deep grooves carved in brick to imitate ashlar architecture.

===19th century architecture===
Toulouse's 19th century architecture can be divided into three periods, which sometimes overlapped. In the first half of the century, at the instigation of architect Jacques-Pascal Virebent, the main architecturally unified squares were created: the ''Place du Capitole'' and the ''Place Wilson'' (called ''place Villeneuve'' when it was built), whose uniform architecture was inspired by [[Rue de Rivoli]] in Paris.

From 1830 onwards, Auguste Virebent and his brothers (sons of Jacques-Pascal) developed a factory of low-cost moulded decorations which met with great success and adorned Toulouse facades with numerous terracotta ornaments, far from the austere architecture of their father.

Then, in the last third of the 19th century, large Haussmann-style avenues were opened in the town centre, such as the central Alsace-Lorraine street, built in yellow brick to imitate Parisian stone.

===20th and 21st centuries architecture===
From the middle of the 19th century, the arrival of the railway in Toulouse facilitated the supply of stone and made it cheaper for construction, and architects did not hesitate to play on the old traditional Toulouse codes linked to the prestige of stone construction, even if these no longer had the economic justification of yesteryear. Thus, at the beginning of the 20th century, the main railway station was built entirely in white stone.

Subsequently, concrete replaced the traditional materials, but brick and stone were still used for cladding, as shown recently by the work of prestigious architects such as [[Robert Venturi]] and [[Denise Scott Brown]] for the seat of the departmental council, or [[Shelley McNamara]] and [[Yvonne Farrell]] for the Toulouse School of Economics building.

=== Banks of the Garonne, Canal du Midi, parks ===
[[File:Toulouse - Garonne et Pont Neuf.jpg|thumb|right|Numerous parks and green spaces line the Garonne in the heart of Toulouse.]]
The banks of the [[Garonne|Garonne river]] offer an interesting urban panorama of the city. Red brick dykes from the 18th century enclose the river which was subject to destructive floods. The [[Pont Neuf, Toulouse|Pont-Neuf]] took almost a century to build as the project was so ambitious (1545-1632). It was a very modern bridge for its time, removing the housing on the deck and using techniques such as lowered arches, openings in the piers and stacked spouts to spread the water, making it the only bridge in Toulouse to withstand the violent floods of the past. Further downstream, the [[Bazacle]] is a ford across the [[Garonne]] river, in the 12th century the [[Bazacle Milling Company]] was the first recorded European joint-stock company. On the left bank of the river, historically a flood-prone bank, stand two former hospitals whose origins date back to the 12th century: the Hôtel-Dieu Saint-Jacques and the [[Hôpital de La Grave]]. Isolated on the left bank, victims of the plague and other sick people were thus kept away from the city by the width of the river.

Built at the end of the 17th century, the [[Canal du Midi]] bypasses the city centre and has linked Toulouse to the Mediterranean Sea ever since. Its 240 kilometres were inscribed as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in 1996.

The ''[[Jardin des Plantes, Toulouse|Jardin des Plantes]]'', the ''Grand Rond'' and the ''Jardin Royal'' form a set of adjacent parks that span several blocks and include the Museum of Natural History, cafés, children's activities and a [[botanical garden]] (18th-19th century). The ''Prairie des Filtres'', the Raymond VI garden and the Japanese garden are other interesting parks that border the center of Toulouse.

The [[University of Toulouse]] (''Université de Toulouse'') was established in 1229 (now split into three separate universities). Like the universities in [[Oxford]] and Paris, the University of Toulouse was established at a time when Europeans were starting to translate the writings of Arabs of Andalus and Greek philosophers. These writings challenged European ideology—inspiring scientific discoveries and advances in the arts—as society began seeing itself in a new way. These colleges were supported by the Church, in hopes of reconciling Greek philosophy and Christian theology.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

=== Metro ===
All urban bus, metro and tram services are operated by [[Tisséo]]. In addition to an extensive bus system (145 lines), the [[Toulouse Metro]] is a [[Véhicule Automatique Léger|VAL]] (Véhicule Automatique Léger) [[rapid transit|metro]] system made up of driverless (automatic) [[rubber-tired underground|rubber-tired]] trains: 

* Line A runs for {{convert|12.5|km|1|abbr=on}} from Balma-Gramont in the north-east to Basso Cambo in the south-west. 

* Line B, which opened in June 2007, serves 20 stations north to south and intersects line A at Jean Jaurès.

Line C is under construction for an opening in 2028 with 21 stations over 27km. It will cross line B at 2 stations (La Vache and François Verdier) and will cross line A at Matabiau Gares (central train station)

Actual Line C has existed since line A was completed. It is not VAL but an urban railway line operated by [[SNCF]]. It connects to line A at [[Gare de Toulouse-Saint-Cyprien-Arènes|Arènes]]. Two other stations located in Toulouse are also served by line C. Lardenne, formerly named "Gare des Capelles", changed its name in September 2003 when line C opened.<ref name="Le RER toulousain entre en gares">{{Cite web |title=Le RER toulousain entre en gares |url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2003/09/01/142866-le-rer-toulousain-entre-en-gares.html |website=ladepeche.fr |access-date=6 February 2016}}</ref> Le TOEC station opened on 1 September 2003 with the creation of line C, allowing an urban train service in Toulouse and close western suburbs.<ref name="Le RER toulousain entre en gares"/> Since 2023, the service is now named ''Arènes-Colomiers'' train line to leave the name for the new metro line.<ref>{{Cite web |date=23 May 2023 |title=Plan détaillé du réseau |url=https://www.tisseo.fr/sites/default/files/plan_detaille_reseau.pdf |access-date=8 July 2023}}</ref>
