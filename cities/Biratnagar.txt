The city is home to various industries inducing the Biratnagar Jute Mills, the first large-scale industry of Nepal. Besides being considered as the industrial capital of Nepal, the city has contributed actively to the [[Nepalese democracy movement]] by being the birthplace of five [[Prime Minister of Nepal|prime ministers of democratic Nepal]]. The latter claim is also evident from the fact that the first [[Biratnagar Jute Mill Strike|labor strike]] leading to the [[1951 Nepalese revolution|anti-Rana movement]] started from Biratnagar.

==History==
In 1914, Colonel Jit Bahadur Khatri, the then district governor, laid the foundations of modern Biratnagar by moving the hospital, post office, prison and the customs, land registry, forestry and auditor offices to Gograha Bazaar from [[Rangeli]], the then district capital of [[Morang District|Morang]].<ref name="Dambar Krishna Shrestha & Kamal Rimal2">{{cite web |last=Dambar Krishna Shrestha & Kamal Rimal |title=१०० वर्षको विराटनगर, मणि खोज्दै (Biratnagar Turns 100, Seeking Glory) |url=http://www.himalkhabar.com/?p=40621 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226041228/http://www.himalkhabar.com/?p=40621 |archive-date=26 December 2013 |access-date=26 December 2013 |work=Himal Khabar |publisher=Himal Media}}</ref>

The recorded history of Biratnagar dates back to the beginning of the 7th century, when King Mung Mawrong Hang came to prominence in the terai lands of [[Limbuwan]] (present-day Sunsari, Morang, and Jhapa areas). He cleared much of the forest area in present-day Rangeli, east of Biratnagar, and built a town there. He named his Kingdom Morang after his name and rose to power.<ref>{{cite book|title=Land and social change in east Nepal By Lionel Caplan, 2000}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=History and Culture of the Kirat People: Part I-II}}</ref>

The old name of Biratnagar was ''Gograha Bazaar''. The ruins of temples, palaces, and ponds are scattered in a vast area to the south of the current city, in Vedhyari, Buddhanagar. The preservation of this heritage has been a major problem citing the encroachment of newcomers into the city.

The town was named Biratnagar in 1919 (1976 [[Vikram Samvat|BS]]) by [[Kaiser Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana|Keshar Shamsher Rana]] after the ruins of a palace, thought to be of [[Virata|King Virat]] (not proved), and other objects of historical importance were found.<ref name="Dambar Krishna Shrestha & Kamal Rimal2"/> Kingdom of Virata mentioned  in Mahabharata is however believed to be [[Viratnagar]], located in present-day Rajasthan. King Virata was the king of the Matsya Kingdom, in whose court the Pandavas spent a year in concealment during their exile. According to the [[Markandeya Purana]], the famous seven Kirata kingdoms during the Mahabharat time were Aswakut or Kabul, Kulya or Kulu Valley, Matsya or North Bihar Paundra or Bengal, Sumer or Assam, Malak or Mlek or Lohit, Kinner Kirat or Garhwal and Nepal. In those days, the Kirat people were ruling all the lands from Himalayan Mountains to the sea shores of the Bay of Bengal.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Dutt, M.N. (1896) |title=Markandeya Puranam. |publisher=Elysium Press.}}</ref>

In Nepali, ''Birat'' ({{Langx|ne|विराट}}) refers to King "[[Virata]]" of the [[Matsya Kingdom]] and ''Nagar'' ({{Langx|ne|नगर}}) means "City"; Literally ''King Virata's City''. still the raja birat durbar in Biratnagar 18 near the icp gate , tole name is vedyari .

On 4 March 1947, the [[Biratnagar Jute Mill Strike|first anti-Rana movement]] in Nepal started in Biratnagar at the Biratnagar jute mills under the leadership of [[Girija Prasad Koirala]] and [[B. P. Koirala]]. This sparked a countrywide anti-Rana demonstration that eventually led to the abolishment of [[Rana dynasty|Rana rule]] in Nepal.
