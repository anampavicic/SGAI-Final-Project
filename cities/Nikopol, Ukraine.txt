'''Nikopol''' ({{langx|uk|Нікополь}}, {{IPA|uk|ˈn⁽ʲ⁾ikopolʲ|pron|Uk-Нікополь.ogg}}) is a [[city]] and [[List of hromadas of Ukraine|municipality]] ([[hromada]])<ref name="admreform_2020_nikopol">{{cite web |title=Никопольская громада |url=https://gromada.info/ru/obschina/nikopolska/ |publisher=Портал об'єднаних громад України |language=ru}}</ref> in [[Nikopol Raion]] in the south of [[Ukraine]], on the right bank of the [[Dnieper|Dnieper River]], about 63&nbsp;km south-east of [[Kryvyi Rih]] and 48&nbsp;km south-west of [[Zaporizhzhia]]. Population: {{Ua-pop-est2022|105.160|punct=.}}

Nikopol is the fourth-most populous city in [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]]. Located on a cape by the [[Kakhovka reservoir]], it is a powerful industrial city with several pipe-producing factories, such as the [[Interpipe]] corporation, and steel rolling mills, such as the factory of [[ferroalloy]]s.

Formerly, the settlement served as one of the [[Sich|capital cities]] of the [[Zaporizhian Sich]] and was known as one of the main crossings over the Dnieper.

==General information==
Renamed by the Russian Empire into Slaviansk and [[Greek Plan|later]] Nikopol (after {{langx|grc|Νικόπολις|lit=City of Victory}}), the city has a rich preceding history. Between 1638 and 1652, it was the settlement of '''Mykytyn Rih''' ({{langx|uk|Микитин Ріг}}, literally ''Mykyta's bend'' or ''Mykyta's horn''), the capital of the [[Zaporizhian Sich]]. It was one of the main crossings over the Dnieper, located on the shore of the [[Great Meadow, Ukraine|Great Meadow]].

The 1911 edition of [[Encyclopedia Britannica]] gave the following description of Nikopol: "It was formerly called Nikitin Rog, and occupies an elongated peninsula between two arms of the Dnieper at a point where its banks are low and marshy, and has been for centuries one of the places where the middle Dnieper can most conveniently be crossed."<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle= Nikopol |volume= 19 |page=692 |short=1}}</ref>

In 1900, its 21,282 inhabitants were [[Ukrainians]], [[Jews]] and [[Mennonites]], who carry on agriculture and shipbuilding.{{Citation needed|date=October 2023}} The old [[Sich]], or fortified camp of the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], brilliantly described in [[Nikolai Gogol|N. V. Gogol]]'s novel [[Taras Bulba]] (1834) was situated a little higher up the river. Several graves in the vicinity recall the battles fought to possess this important strategic point. 

One of the graves, close to the town, contained, along with other [[Scythia]]n antiquities, a well-known precious vase representing the capture of wild horses. Even now Nikopol, which is situated on the highway from Dnipro to [[Kherson]], is the point where the "salt-highway" of the [[Chumaks]] (Ukrainian salt-carriers) to the [[Crimea]] crossed the Dnipro. Nikopol is, further, one of the chief places on the lower Dnieper for the export of corn, linseed, hemp, and wool.

{{see also|Golden Pectoral from Tovsta Mohyla}}
According to archaeological excavations, the city's area was populated as early as the [[Neolithic epoch]] in the 4th millennium BCE<ref name=thocavotu>[http://imsu-dnipropetrovsk.com/mista-i-sela/nikopolskyj-rajon/nikopol.html Nikopol (Нікополь)].

===Mykytyn Rih / Mykytyn Sich===
{{see also|Zaporizhian Sich}}
At the beginning of the 16th century, in the location of modern Nikopol, appeared a river crossing over the [[Dnieper]] controlled by [[Cossacks]], 
called '''Mykytyn Rih'''.<ref name=thocavotu/> According to a folk legend, a Cossack named Mykyta Tsyhan established it.<ref name=thocavotu/> Under the same name, the crossing is mentioned in the diary of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] envoy {{ill|Erich Lassota von Steblau|de|Erich Lassota von Steblau}}, who visited the [[Zaporizhian Sich]] in 1594.<ref name=thocavotu/>

In 1638-1639, Cossacks led by F. Linchai built a fort which was named '''Mykytyn Sich''' ({{langx|uk|Микитинська Січ}}).<ref>Bazhan, O.

By 1648, in the proximity of today's Nikopol, Mykytyn Sich was built. It is renowned for the location of [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] being elected as the Hetman of Ukraine and as where the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] against the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] started. Until 1775, the time of the [[Zaporizhian Sich#History|Sich sacking]], it was called "Mykytyn Rih", "Mykytyn Pereviz", or simply "Mykytyne". 

The name ''rih'' (Ukrainian for horn) was given because the locality rose at a place reminiscing a peninsula, as it was almost surrounded by the [[Dnieper river]] (see [[Kryvyi Rih]]). Mykytyne was a town of the Kodak Palanka, an administrative division of the [[Zaporizhian Sich]]. Later, it was renamed into Slovianske and then Nikopol.

===Sloviansk / Nikopol===
In the 18th century, [[Grigoriy Potyomkin]] ordered the building of an Imperial Russian fortress at Slaviansk. Eventually, the project was scrapped. Soon after the [[liquidation of the Zaporozhian Sich]] in 1782, the settlement was renamed Nikopol. 

During [[World War II]], Nikopol was occupied by the [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] until 18 February 1944. [[Albert Speer]] referred to it as the "center of [[manganese]] mining", and, therefore, of vital importance to the German war effort.<ref name="Speer">{{cite book|last1=Speer|first1=Albert|title=Inside the Third Reich|date=1995|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|location=London|isbn=9781842127353|pages=430}}</ref>

The Soviet policy of industrialization created the [[Kakhovka Reservoir]] which existed from 1956 to 2023, submerging what could be now the most sacred place of an early distinctly Ukrainian statehood: the lands of the former [[Zaporizhian Host]], with their burial sites.

Until July 2020, Nikopol was incorporated as a [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]] and served as the administrative center of Nikopol Raion, though it did not belong to the raion. In July 2020, as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast to seven, the city of Nikopol was merged into Nikopol Raion.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Про утворення та ліквідацію районів. Постанова Верховної Ради України № 807-ІХ.|url=http://www.golos.com.ua/article/333466|access-date=2020-10-03|date=2020-07-18|website=Голос України|language=uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Нові райони: карти + склад |url=https://www.minregion.gov.ua/press/news/novi-rajony-karty-sklad/ |publisher=Міністерство розвитку громад та територій України |language=Ukrainian}}</ref>

Just a few kilometres west of the city, the [[Kosh otaman]] [[Ivan Sirko]] is buried.

Nikopol is one of the largest towns in the region, with a population of 105,160 in 2022. The largest manufacturers include the former Nikopol Tube Plant, established in 1931,<ref>{{Cite web|title=IНТЕРПАЙП НIКО ТЬЮБ|url=https://nikotube.interpipe.biz/|access-date=2021-02-16|website=nikotube.interpipe.biz}}</ref> which is now divided into smaller plants (e.g. Centravis, Interpipe Niko Tube). The Nikopol Ferroalloy Plant is the largest in Europe and the second largest in the world in the production of Ferromanganese (FeMn) and Ferrosilicomanganese (FeSiMn).
