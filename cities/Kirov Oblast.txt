'''Kirov Oblast''' ({{lang-rus|Кировская область|p=ˈkʲirəfskəjə ˈobləsʲtʲ}}) is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]] (an [[oblast]]) located in [[Eastern Europe]]. Its [[administrative center]] is the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Kirov]]. As of the [[2010 Russian census|2010 census]], the population is 1,341,312.<ref name="2010Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2010Census}}</ref>

==Geography==

===Natural resources===
Natural resources include forests (mostly conifers), [[phosphate]] rock, [[peat]], [[fur]]s, water and land. There are widespread deposits of [[peat]] and non-metallic minerals: [[limestone]], [[marl]], [[clay]], [[sand]] and [[gravel]], as well as the rare mineral volkonskoite.{{cn|date=August 2024}} 

In recent decades,  a minor recoverable oil reserve was revealed in the east of the region, as well as deposits of bentonite clays. The region also contains the Vyatsko-Kama deposit of [[Phosphate|phosphate rock]], the largest in Europe. Rich in mineral springs, the [[Kumyonsky District]] contains the resort town of [[Nizhneivkino]].{{cn|date=August 2024}}

===Hydrography===
Kirov Oblast is characterized by diverse hydrography, including numerous rivers, lakes, and reservoirs which play an essential role in its geography, economy, and ecology. The hydrographic network of Kirov Oblast is dominated by the Volga River basin, one of the largest river systems in Europe, but additionally encompasses the Severodvinsk

The rivers in Kirov Oblast are numerous, with more than 19,000 rivers and streams and spanning 66.7 kilometers. Some of the most significant rivers include the [[Vyatka (river)|Vyatka]], [[Moloma]], [[Cheptsa]], and [[Kama (river)|Kama]] rivers. The region contains approximately 4,500 lakes, many of which are of glacial origin, with a combined water surface area of 5.5 million hectares. These lakes provide habitats for various species of fish and birds and are often used for recreational purposes. The rivers and lakes of Kirov Oblast are integral to the region's natural environment and economy, providing water for agriculture, supporting fisheries, and transportation.

==History==
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Vyatka remained a place of exile for opponents of the [[Russian Empire|tsarist regime]], including many prominent revolutionary figures. In 1920, a number of small southern and eastern districts (volosti) and villages were shifted from Vyatka as a result of the formation of the [[Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] and the Mari and Votskaya (now the [[Udmurtia|Udmurt Republic]]) autonomous regions.

The territory did not escape the [[Russian Civil War]] and intervention of 1918–1921. Then between 1921 and 1922, it was [[Russian famine of 1921–1922|hit by famine]], followed by a typhus epidemic in late 1922. The death rate doubled during those years. The postwar period was accompanied by rebuilding of the province on the basis of the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP), which consisted of free trade, [[entrepreneurship]], and private sector stimulation. 

The country's first office of the International Organization for Aid to Fighters of the Revolution (IOAR) began operations here in January 1923.

The administrative and territorial reforms of 1929 eliminated the old division of the country into provinces and districts ([[Uezd]], [[Volost]]) and introduced a new system of division into regions, territories, and districts (raiony). Vyatka Province was abolished, and its territory became part of [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast]]. The city of Vyatka became a district center.<ref>[[s:Постановление Президиума ВЦИК от 14 января 1929 года|Постановление ВЦИК от 14.01.1929 «Об образовании на территории Р. С. Ф. С. Р. административно-территориальных объединений краевого и областного значения»]]</ref>

On 5 December 1934, the Presidium of the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] (VTsIK) passed a resolution renaming the city from Vyatka to Kirov, and Kirov Oblast was formed on 7 December.<ref name="Established">''Administrative-Territorial Structure of the Union Republics. 1987.'', p.&nbsp;155</ref> It included the Udmurt Autonomous Region, 37 districts (raiony) of Gorki Region (which had formerly been part of Vyatka Province), as well as Sapapulsky and Votkinsky districts of Sverdlovsk Region. Following the adoption of the new Constitution in 1936, Kirov Territory was transformed into Kirov Region and the Udmurt Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR) was separated from it.<ref name="Established" /> 

On 30 October 1997, Kirov, alongside [[Astrakhan Oblast|Astrakhan]], [[Murmansk Oblast|Murmansk]], [[Ulyanovsk Oblast|Ulyanovsk]], and [[Yaroslavl Oblast|Yaroslavl]], signed a power-sharing agreement with the government of Russia, granting it autonomy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/program/yeltsin-signs-power-sharing-agreements-with-five-more-russian-regions/|title=Yeltsin Signs Power-Sharing Agreements With Five More Russian Regions|date=1997-11-03|website=Jamestown|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-02}}</ref> The agreement would be abolished on 24 January 2002.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chuman|first=Mizuki|title=The Rise and Fall of Power-Sharing Treaties Between Center and Regions in Post-Soviet Russia|url=http://demokratizatsiya.pub/archives/19_2_L7H017206G216817.pdf|journal=Demokratizatsiya|pages=146}}</ref>

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Kirov Oblast}}

Kirov Oblast was formed on 7 December 1934. It is divided administratively into 39 districts, 6 cities under oblast jurisdiction, 13 town under district jurisdiction, 58 urban-type settlements, and 580 selsoviets.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Economy==

Kirov Oblast is part of the Volga–Vyatka economic district located in the central part of European Russia in the [[Volga River|Volga]] and [[Vyatka River|Vyatka]] river basins. Its economic complex had already begun forming and developing before the [[Russian Revolution|Revolution]], in large part because of the transfer points and trading posts located in [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Vyatka]], which later led to the formation of large . Trading Centers Agriculture was the priority sector at first, but starting in 1940, there was an upsurge in development of an industrial complex, especially the [[engineering]], [[metalworking]], and chemical industries.<ref name="Kirov Region">{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.com/t-47/r_5/n_390/Kirov_Region/|title=Kirov Region|website=kommersant.com|access-date=March 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217043236/http://www.kommersant.com/t-47/r_5/n_390/Kirov_Region/|archive-date=February 17, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Kirov Oblast is part of the Volga–Vyatka agricultural zone, where more than half of the area sown in grain is located in Kirov Oblast itself. Agricultural land occupies 27% of the region's territory. The most important [[Cereal|grain crops]] are winter and spring [[wheat]] and [[rye]]. Barley and oats are grown for fodder. Increased specialization in the production of more promising [[fodder crop]]s like [[winter rye]], [[barley]], [[oat]]s that are most suited to the Oblast's climatic conditions is anticipated in the future. [[Potatoes]] are also extensively cultivated.<ref name="Kirov Region"/>

===Petroleum infrastructure===
====2024 oil infrastructure attack====
The Kirov Oblast is the site of the Rosrezerves' Zenit oil depot in [[Kotelnich]], a large [[petroleum]] tank farm installation of the [[Federal Agency for State Reserves|Russian State Reserve]].

On 28 August 2024, during the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]], it was attacked and set ablaze by a [[Ukrainian Armed Forces]] drone strike.  This was the first attack on the region since the start of hostilities, and is deep in inland Russia, over 1000 km from the Ukrainian border.<ref>[https://mil.in.ua/en/news/drones-hit-a-russian-oil-depot-more-than-1-000-kilometers-away-from-ukraine/ Drones hit a Russian oil depot more than 1,000 kilometers away from Ukraine], MILITARYNYI, 28 August 2024.</ref>

==Politics==
During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Kirov CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

The Charter of Kirov Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Kirov Oblast is the province's standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].
