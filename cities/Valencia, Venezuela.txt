'''Valencia''' ({{IPA|es|baˈlensja}}) is the  capital city of [[Carabobo]] State and the third-largest city in  [[Venezuela]].

The city is an economic hub that contains Venezuela's top industries and manufacturing companies. It is also the largest city in the Valencia-Maracay metropolitan region, which with a population of about 4.5 million is the country's second largest after that of [[Caracas]]. [[Caracas]] lies some {{convert|172|km|0|abbr=off}} away to the east.

== History ==

[[File:BatallaCarabobo02.JPG|thumb|Battle of Carabobo in 1821]]
The area was already inhabited in the fourth millennium BC. The inhabitants were mainly hunters and gatherers who might have already developed some elementary forms of agriculture. Between AD 200 and 1000 an important settlement was formed close to Lake Valencia.

Around the year 1000, waves of migration started to come from the Orinoco river area, probably arriving along the Pao river. The fusion of previous settlements with these new populations gave rise to the Vacencioide culture.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.carabobo.gob.ve/municipios2.php?id_municipio=1 |title=History of Valencia (Spanish) |access-date=July 12, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406153127/http://www.carabobo.gob.ve/municipios2.php?id_municipio=1 |archive-date=April 6, 2008 |url-status=dead|df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.notitarde.com/portadas/ediciones/aniver/aniver2004/huella.html |title=Pre-Columbian history in Notitarde (Spanish) |access-date=July 12, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080712064135/http://www.notitarde.com/portadas/ediciones/aniver/aniver2004/huella.html |archive-date=July 12, 2008 |url-status=dead|df=mdy-all }}</ref>

People in the area belonged mostly to [[Arawak]] groups. They were hunters and gatherers who also fished and grew maize and cotton. Their houses were built on artificial mounds in valleys that were often flooded by water from Lake Valencia.

Archaeologists have found mostly pottery from that time. Valencia was founded by Captain [[Alonso Díaz Moreno]] on March 25, 1555{{spaced ndash}}as the locals are proud of reminding visitors, eight years before [[Caracas]]. It was the first Spanish settlement in north-central Venezuela and its official name was ''Nuestra Señora de la Asunción de Nueva Valencia del Rey''. It was named after [[Valencia de Don Juan]], [[Province of León]], [[Spain]]. The encomiendas put the Indians living in the region under the control of the Spanish settlers. They started to displace the native population from the most fertile land, but they also started intermarrying with them.

Spanish conquistador [[Lope de Aguirre]] entered the city in 1561. In 1677 it was raided by French pirates, who burnt down its City Hall, thus destroying many very important documents about the early settlement of Venezuela. The German scientist [[Alexander von Humboldt]] visited the city on his trip through the Americas. He reported that at the time of his visit the city had around 6000 to 7000 inhabitants. On June 24, 1821, the [[battle of Carabobo]] was fought on the outskirts of the city, sealing the [[Venezuelan War of Independence|independence of Venezuela]] from imperial Spanish rule.

Valencia became the capital of Venezuela in 1830, after it separated from [[Gran Colombia]]. It ceased to be the capital soon afterward, becoming once more the seat of the national government in 1858 after the Monagas was toppled and the March Revolution took place. On November 15, 1892, the University of Valencia, future University of Carabobo, was founded. When dictator Juan Vicente Gómez died in 1935, Nueva Valencia del Rey was a small city. The oil revenues and industrialization that came along lead to a population explosion. Many immigrants, firstly from Europe and increasingly then from other Latin American countries, chose Nueva Valencia del Rey as the place to live in Venezuela.

The first direct election of local governments (including those of the mayor and of the state's government) took place in 1988.

Valencia was one of the places where Hugo Chávez's proposal for the constitutional reform was rejected with the highest proportion of votes: around 59.21% of the population rejected it.<ref>[http://www.cne.gov.ve/divulgacion_referendo_reforma/index.php?cod_estado=07&cod_municipio=09 Results for constitutional referendum in Valencia]</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:Lomas del Este Valencia.JPG|thumb|right|220px|View of Valencia from Lomas del Este.]]
Valencia is located in a central valley, surrounded by a mountain range called the Coastal Range (''[[Venezuelan Coastal Range|Cordillera de la Costa]]''). On the eastern outskirts of the city lies [[Lake Valencia (Venezuela)|Lake Valencia]], Venezuela's second-largest lake. To the West and Northeastern part there are mountains. To the south is an extension of the Venezuelan grasslands, the Llanos.

The elevation of the city is {{convert|520|m|ft|abbr=off}}.

=== Climate ===
Valencia has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Aw''). The city experiences a distinct [[wet season]] from May to November. The [[dry season]] extends from December to April, with significantly lower precipitation. Valencia, due to its latitude and closeness to the sea, has relatively warm temperatures. The yearly average is {{convert|26|°C|0}}, ({{convert|23.3|°C|1}} in the shade, a maximum of {{convert|32.6|°C|1}} and minimum of {{convert|18.5|°C|1}}). The city is located {{convert|479|m|0|abbr=off}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Winds reduce the temperature in the afternoon.
