[[Archeology|Archaeological]] findings indicate that the area surrounding Zwolle has been inhabited for a long time. A [[Henge|woodhenge]] that was found in the Zwolle-Zuid suburb in 1993 was dated to the [[Bronze Age]] period.<ref>Theo Holleman (1996), ''Een verleden op de schop'', University Press, Amsterdam, {{ISBN|90-5356-189-7}}</ref><ref>Hove, ten J. (2005). ''Geschiedenis van Zwolle'' Zwolle: Waanders. {{ISBN|90-400-9050-5}}</ref> During the Roman era, the area was inhabited by [[Salian Franks]].

The modern city was founded around 800 CE by [[Frisians|Frisian]] merchants and troops of [[Charlemagne]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.historischcentrumoverijssel.nl/zwolle/zw/geschz1.htm|title=Het begin|access-date=17 March 2007|author=F.C.

This refers to an incline in the landscape between the four rivers surrounding the city, [[IJssel]], [[Vecht (Overijssel)|Vecht]], Aa and [[Zwarte Water]]. The hill was the only piece of land that would remain dry during the frequent floodings of the rivers. Zwolle was established on that incline.

{{anchor|Saint Michael|Saint Michael Church|St. Michael|St. Michael Church}}
A document mentions the existence of a parish church dedicated to [[Michael (archangel)|St Michael]]. That church, the Grote of Sint Michaëlskerk (St. Michael's church), was renovated in the first half of the 15th century and exists to this day. The church contains a richly carved [[pulpit]], the work of Adam Straes van Weilborch (about 1620), some good carving, and an exquisite [[Organ (instrument)|Baroque organ]] from 1721 designed by master organ builder [[Arp Schnitger]] and completed by his sons Franz Caspar and Johann Georg.

On 31 August 1230, the bishop of [[Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] granted Zwolle [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]]. Zwolle became a member of the [[Hanseatic league]] in 1294, and in 1361 joined the war between the Hanseatic League and [[Valdemar IV of Denmark]]. In the 1370 [[Treaty of Stralsund (1370)|Treaty of Stralsund]] that ended the war, Zwolle was awarded a ''vitte'', a trade colony, in [[Scania]], then part of [[Denmark]]. Zwolle's golden age came in the 15th century. Between 1402 and 1450, the city's [[Gross Regional Product]] multiplied by about six.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.historischcentrumoverijssel.nl/zwolle/zw/geschz4.htm|title=De handel en de Hanze|access-date=17 March 2007|author=F.C.

Zwolle was also, with [[Deventer]], one of the centers of the [[Brethren of the Common Life]], a [[monastic]] movement. {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} from Zwolle, on a slight eminence called the Agnietenberg, (hill of St Agnes), once stood the Augustinian convent in which [[Thomas à Kempis]] spent the greatest part of his life and died (in 1471).<ref name="EB1911"/>

At least as early as 1911, Zwolle had a considerable trade by river, a large fish market, and the most important cattle market in the Netherlands after [[Rotterdam]]. The more important industries comprised cotton manufactures, iron works, boat-building, dyeing and bleaching, tanning, rope-making, and salt-making.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Zwolle |volume=28 |page=1064}}</ref>

===Blauwvingers===
Citizens of Zwolle are colloquially known as ''Blauwvingers'' (Bluefingers). According to legend, this dates back to 1682, when the St&nbsp;Michael's church tower collapsed. The authorities were strapped for cash and saw no option but to sell the [[church bell]]s to neighbouring city [[Kampen, Overijssel|Kampen]]. To make sure that Kampen would not make too much profit from the deal, the local authorities asked a high price for the church bells. Kampen accepted, yet after the arrival of the bells it became clear, they were too damaged to be played. In revenge, Kampen paid in copper coins of four [[duit|''duiten'']] (the equivalent of two-and-a-half [[Dutch guilder|cents]]). Zwolle distrusted Kampen and wanted to be sure they truly paid the entire price. After the rigorous counting of this vast amount of money, their fingers had turned blue from the counting of money.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Boxma|first=Willem|year=2001|title=Steuren, blauwvingers, kwekweschudders en tukkers. Schimpnamen in Overijssel|journal=Traditie.

In reality, the name Blauwvinger stems from 1521, when the governors of Zwolle broke the oath of loyalty they made to the Duke of Gelre. The name Blauwvinger refers to the raised fingers, with which the governors had promised their loyalty to the Duke at his inauguration. At that time, Zwolle and Kampen were embroiled in a dispute over toll collection on the IJssel River. Zwolle initially aligned with the Duke of Gelre, Charles of Egmont, but eventually returned to the Bishop of Utrecht. During this period of political unrest, Duke Charles of Gelre was captured when he entered Zwolle. Ultimately, he was allowed to depart under the condition that Zwolle would retain its independence. The name Blauwvingers stems from the fact that the residents committed perjury twice, first to the bishop and then to the duke.

==Geography==
[[File:Gem-Zwolle-OpenTopo.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|Dutch Topographic map of the city of Zwolle, september 2022]]
Besides the Grote of Sint Michaëlskerk (St. Michael's church), the latter which houses a majestic [[Baroque]] organ built by [[Arp Schnitger]], there are several other historic monuments in Zwolle. The Roman Catholic ''Onze Lieve Vrouwe ten Hemelopneming''-[[basilica]] (Our Lady of the Assumption) dates back to 1399. The church tower, called ''[[Peperbus (Zwolle)|Peperbus]]'' (pepperpot), is one of the tallest and most famous church towers in the Netherlands. The modernized [[town hall]] was originally built in 1448.<ref name="EB1911"/>

Mention should also be made of the ''Sassenpoort'' (one of the old city gates), the city walls, the ''Mosterdmakerstoren'' (''mustard makers' tower'') (the complex where local mustard used to be made), a guild-house (1571), the former provincial government offices, a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monastery, and on the Melkmarkt, two museums; the [[Stedelijk Museum Zwolle]] of antiquities and natural history, and the [[Vrouwenhuis, Zwolle|Vrouwenhuis]]. [[Museum de Fundatie]], the fine art museum of the province of Overijssel, is hosted in the former Justice Hall on Blijmarkt Square.

In the western part of the city, west of the railway station, there is a quarter of [[Art Nouveau]] buildings, concentrated mostly on Koningin Wilhelminastraat, Prinses Julianastraat, and Prins Hendrikstraat. These three-store living houses were built in 1900s by various Dutch architects. Eleven of the buildings are protected by the Dutch government ([[rijksmonument]]en).

The ''Broerenkerk'' church was part of the [[Dominican order|Dominican monastery]] founded in 1465. The monastery was closed in 1580 and the monks were expelled. From 1640 until 1982 the church was used for Protestant services. After a restoration in 1983–1988 it has been used for cultural events and it is now a bookstore.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archimon.nl/overijssel/zwollebroerenkerk.html |title=Zwolle (Ov): Broerenkerk |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=archimon.nl |access-date=10 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rickscholten.nl/page.php?id=3 |title=Waanders in the Broerenkerk |last1=Scholten |first1=Rick |access-date=10 August 2013 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Transport==

===Road transport===
Zwolle is a hub in the national highway network, and gateway to northern Netherlands. This is reflected in the high traffic volumes in and around the city. The [[A28 motorway (Netherlands)|A28]] serves Zwolle with 4 exits, and runs from [[Utrecht]] to [[Groningen]]. It is being widened to 8 lanes across the [[IJssel River]] and 6 lanes from Zwolle to Meppel in 2010 and 2011. The motorway initially opened between 1964 and 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autosnelwegen.nl/asw/dos/dosA28.htm|title=completion dates A28 at autosnelwegen.nl}}</ref> Another motorway, the [[A50 motorway (Netherlands)|A50]], interchanges with A28 just west of the city, offering a route for southbound traffic to [[Apeldoorn]] and [[Eindhoven]].

The [[Provincial road N35 (Netherlands)|N35]] highway starts in Zwolle, where it forms the eastern section of the ring road of Zwolle, it runs as a non-motorway to [[Almelo]] and continues to [[Enschede]] as [[A35 motorway (Netherlands)|A35 motorway]]. The ringroad is mainly a 4-lane road, with numerous traffic lights. It forms a full ring, and also exists out of the [[Provincial road N337 (Netherlands)|N337]] highway that runs to [[Deventer]]. Other sections of the ring road are not numbered. Parts of the ring road were widened to six lanes in 2010. Other numbered highways running from Zwolle are [[Provincial road N331 (Netherlands)|N331]] to [[Hasselt, Overijssel|Hasselt]], [[Provincial road N758 (Netherlands)|N758]] to [[Nieuwleusen]], [[Provincial road N340 (Netherlands)|N340]] to [[Ommen]] and [[Provincial road N764 (Netherlands)|N764]] to [[Kampen, Overijssel|Kampen]].

===Bridges===
Due to nearby rivers, there are several major bridges in and around Zwolle. The most important bridge is the IJssel Bridge where the A28 motorway runs across. It was completed in 1970 and carries over 125.000 vehicles per day. Adjacent to this bridge is the older IJssel Bridge, which opened in 1930 and was destroyed twice during [[World War II]]. A third IJssel Bridge is the railway bridge (called Hanze boog) which carries the railway line from Zwolle to [[Amersfoort]], and from 2012, to [[Lelystad]]. There are several bridges across the [[Zwarte Water]] River, including two 4-lane bridges, a 2-lane bridge, and a bus/bicycle bridge. There is also a bridge across the [[Vecht (Overijssel)|Vecht]], which carries A28 motorway. Another local bridge is adjacent to this bridge. A third bridge carries rail traffic to [[Leeuwarden]] and [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]]. Numerous local bridges exist around the historic city center.

===Rail transport===
* [[Zwolle railway station]]

The first train in Zwolle arrived on 6 June 1864. Today the city has [[railroad|rail connections]] in eight directions (viz. [[Kampen, Overijssel|Kampen]], [[Leeuwarden]], [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], [[Emmen, Netherlands|Emmen]], [[Enschede]], [[Arnhem]]/[[Nijmegen]], [[Lelystad]]/[[Amsterdam]], and [[Amersfoort]]).

The [[railroad|rail connection]] with [[Amsterdam]] via [[Lelystad]] – the [[Hanzelijn]] – is operational since December 2012.

The second station, [[Zwolle Stadshagen railway station|Zwolle Stadshagen]], was opened on 15 December 2019.

===Water transport===
Zwolle is located on or near three rivers ([[Zwarte Water]], [[Vecht (Overijssel)|Vecht]], and [[IJssel]]), several [[canal]]s (the now disused Willemsvaart, Nieuwe Vecht and Overijssels Kanaal and the modern Zwolle-IJssel Kanaal). There are some water-related industries in Zwolle, mainly in the Voorst industrial area.
