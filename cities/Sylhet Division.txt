==History==
{{Main|History of Sylhet}}
[[File:AssamProvince1936 Map.png|thumb|The Assam Province's Sylhet District contained Karimganj.]]
In 1874, the current Sylhet Division, which included [[Karimganj District]], was entirely known as the 'Sylhet district'. On 16 February 1874, [[Sylhet division|Sylhet]] was separated from mainland Bengal to be made a part of the [[non-regulation province|non-regulation]] [[Chief Commissioner's Province of Assam|Chief Commissioner's Province of Assam (Northeast Frontier Province)]] in order to facilitate Assam's commercial development.<ref>{{cite book |author=Tanweer Fazal |year=2013 |title=Minority Nationalisms in South Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6bGMAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA53 |publisher=Routledge |pages=53–54 |isbn=978-1-317-96647-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Hossain |first=Ashfaque |year=2013 |title=The Making and Unmaking of Assam-Bengal Borders and the Sylhet Referendum |journal=Modern Asian Studies |volume=47 |number=1 |page=261 |jstor=23359785 |doi=10.1017/S0026749X1200056X |s2cid=145546471 |quote="To make [the Province] financially viable, and to accede to demands from professional groups, [the colonial administration] decided in September 1874 to annex the Bengali-speaking and populous district of Sylhet."}}</ref> The people of Sylhet submitted a memorandum to the Viceroy protesting the inclusion in Assam.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hossain |first=Ashfaque |year=2013 |title=The Making and Unmaking of Assam-Bengal Borders and the Sylhet Referendum |journal=Modern Asian Studies |volume=47 |number=1 |page=261 |jstor=23359785 |doi=10.1017/S0026749X1200056X |s2cid=145546471 |quote="A memorandum of protest against the transfer of Sylhet was submitted to the viceroy on 10 August 1874 by leaders of both the Hindu and Muslim communities."}}</ref> The protests subsided when the Viceroy, [[Thomas Baring, 1st Earl of Northbrook|Lord Northbrook]], visited Sylhet to reassure the people that education and justice would be administered from Bengal,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hossain |first=Ashfaque |year=2013 |title=The Making and Unmaking of Assam-Bengal Borders and the Sylhet Referendum |journal=Modern Asian Studies |volume=47 |number=1 |page=262 |jstor=23359785 |doi=10.1017/S0026749X1200056X |s2cid=145546471 |quote="It was also decided that education and justice would be administered from Calcutta University and the Calcutta High Court respectively."}}</ref> and when the people in Sylhet saw the opportunity of employment in tea estates in Assam and a market for their produce.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hossain |first=Ashfaque |year=2013 |title=The Making and Unmaking of Assam-Bengal Borders and the Sylhet Referendum |journal=Modern Asian Studies |volume=47 |number=1 |page=262 |jstor=23359785 |doi=10.1017/S0026749X1200056X |s2cid=145546471 |quote="They could also see that the benefits conferred by the tea industry on the province would also prove profitable for them. For example, those who were literate were able to obtain numerous clerical and medical appointments in tea estates, and the demand for rice to feed the tea labourers noticeably augmented its price in Sylhet and Assam enabling the Zaminders (mostly Hindu) to dispose of their produce at a better price than would have been possible had they been obliged to export it to Bengal."}}</ref> In 1905, Sylhet district rejoined Bengal as a part of the new ''Surma Valley Division'' of [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]]. In 1912, the then Sylhet district was once again moved to the newly created [[Assam Province]] alongside the other districts of the Surma Valley Division.

Historically, the entire Sylhet region was a single district within the ''Surma Valley and Hill Districts'' Division as part of the Assam Province. In 1947, a [[1947 Sylhet referendum|referendum]] was held in the Sylhet district, the people of the whole district voting in favour of succession to Pakistan. However, the district's [[Karimganj district|Karimganj subdivision]] was given to India by Cyril Radcliffe, after apparently being pleaded by a delegation led by [[Abdul Matlib Mazumdar]]. The four other subdivisions ([[North Sylhet]], [[South Sylhet]], [[Habiganj District|Habiganj]] and [[Sunamganj District|Sunamganj]]) joined the [[Dominion of Pakistan]]; subsequently forming [[East Bengal]]'s 'Sylhet district' in the Chittagong division.

Following the [[Independence of Bangladesh]] in 1971, Sylhet became part of the newly formed country. In 1984, the four subdivisions of Sylhet district were upgraded to districts as part of [[H M Ershad]]'s decentralisation programme. The four districts remained in the [[Chittagong Division]] until 1995 when they formed the new Sylhet Division.

The Sylhet Division has a "friendship link" with the city of [[St Albans]], in the United Kingdom. The link was established in 1988 when the [[St Albans District Council]] supported a housing project in Sylhet as part of the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless. Sylhet was chosen because it is the area of origin for the largest ethnic minority group in St Albans.<ref>[http://www.stalbans.gov.uk/community-and-living/town-twinning/Sylhet-Bangladesh.aspx Sylhet, Bangladesh] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619055954/http://www.stalbans.gov.uk/community-and-living/town-twinning/Sylhet-Bangladesh.aspx |date=19 June 2009 }}.St.Albans District Council.</ref> Sylhet also has many "friendship links" with other cities in the [[United Kingdom]], as the majority of the half-million [[British Bangladeshis]] have origins in Sylhet. This includes places such as [[Rochdale, UK|Rochdale]], [[Oldham]], [[London]], and many more places.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

[[File:Tea Garden in Malini chora Sylhet Bangladesh (3).JPG|thumb|The Mulnicherra Estate is the oldest tea garden in South Asia]]
The area around Sylhet is a traditional tea growing area. The Surma Valley is covered with terraces of tea gardens and tropical forests. [[Srimangal]] is known as the tea capital of Bangladesh; for miles around, tea gardens are visible on the hill slopes.

The area has over 150 tea gardens, including three of the largest tea plantations in the world, both in terms of area and production. Nearly 300,000 workers, of which more than 75% are women, are employed on the tea estates. Employers prefer to engage women for plucking tea leaves since they do a better job than, but are paid less than, men. A recent drought has killed nearly a tenth of the tea shrubs.

The plantations, or gardens, were mostly developed during the [[British Raj]]. The plantations were started by the British, and the managers still live in the white timber houses built during the Raj. The bungalows stand on huge lawns. The service and the lifestyle of managers are still unchanged.

Numerous projects and businesses in the city and in large towns have been funded by Sylhetis living and working abroad. As of 1986, an estimated 95 percent of ethnic [[British Bangladeshi]]s originated from or had ancestors from the Sylhet region.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gardner |first=Katy |date=July 1992 |title=International migration and the rural context in Sylhet |journal=New Community |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=579–590 |doi=10.1080/1369183X.1992.9976331}}</ref> The Bangladesh government has set up a special [[Export Processing Zone]] (EPZ) in Sylhet, in order to attract foreign investors, mainly from the UK.

Sylhet has also benefited from tourism. There are many natural landmarks people tend to visit, such as the [[Keane Bridge]], [[Ali Amjad's Clock]], [[Lalakhal]], [[Jaflong]], [[Madhabkunda waterfall]], [[Ratargul Swamp Forest]], [[Hakaluki Haor]], [[Lawachara National Park]], [[Tanguar Haor]] and [[Bichnakandi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mybangla24.com/best-things-to-do-in-sylhet-division |title=Best Things to Do in Sylhet Division of Bangladesh |access-date=29 October 2020 |archive-date=29 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201029125455/https://mybangla24.com/best-things-to-do-in-sylhet-division |url-status=live }}</ref> Sylhet is also considered to be the spiritual capital of Bangladesh, due to the resting place of [[Shah Jalal]], a Sufi saint who spread Islam in Bangladesh, along with hundreds of his disciples. The [[Sylhet Shahi Eidgah]] is a famous place where Eid prayers take place and it is one of the largest Eidgahs in Bangladesh, built by [[Farhad Khan]] during the reign of Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]]. There are a number of hotels and resorts, particularly in [[Sreemangal Upazila]] and [[Bahubal Upazila]].

In 1995, Sylhet split from the Chittagong Division and was declared the 6th division of the country. The Sylhet Division is overseen by the Divisional Commissioner, the current Divisional Commissioner is Md. Mashiur Rahman. The Sylhet Division is divided into four districts ([[Habiganj District|Habiganj]], [[Moulvibazar District|Moulvibazar]], [[Sunamganj District|Sunamganj]] and [[Sylhet District|Sylhet]]) and further divided into 35 [[upazila]]s (sub-districts). These upazilas are further divided into 323 [[union parishad]]s. Each union is roughly divided into 9 wards before going to village-level. There are roughly 10,185 villages in the Division. The Division hosts 19 [[Municipal corporation]]s known as [[pourashava]]s, and one city corporation in [[Sylhet City Corporation|Sylhet city]]. It also has 19 [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in Bangladesh|Parliamentary constituencies]]. The headquarters of the Sylhet Division is the city of Sylhet in [[Sylhet Sadar Upazila]], Sylhet District. Pre-partition Sylhet's [[Karimganj district|Karimganj]] has been governed by [[India]] since 1947.

==Geography==
[[File:Kala pahar.jpg|thumb|The highest peak in the region is [[Kala pahar]] located in the Longla Ridge (Hararganj-Singla range).]]
[[File:Nature of hakaluki haor.jpg|thumb|[[Hakaluki Haor]] is the largest [[haor]] in [[Bangladesh]].]]
Geographically the region is surrounded by hillocks (known as ''tilla''s) from all three sides except its western plain boundary with the rest of [[Bengal]]. In the south of the region ([[Habiganj District|Habiganj]], [[Moulvibazar District|Moulvibazar]]), eight hill ranges enter the plains of Sylhet running uniformly from the west to the east. They are: Raghunandan, Dinarpur-Shatgaon, Balishira, Bhanugach-Rajkandi, Hararganj-Singla, Patharia, Pratapgarh-Duhalia and Sorrispur-Siddheswar hill ranges. At the centre of the region is also an isolated range known as the Ita Hills.<ref name=heads>{{cite book|title=Principal Heads of the History and Statistics of the Dacca Division|chapter=Sylhet District|pages=281–326|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/principalheadsh00unkngoog/page/n294|year=1868|location=Calcutta|author=E M Lewis|publisher=Calcutta Central Press Company}}</ref>

The region is considered one of the most picturesque and archaeologically rich regions in [[South Asia]]. It is home to three [[national park]]s; the [[Lawachara National Park]], [[Khadim Nagar National Park]] and [[Satchari National Park]], as well as numerous smaller parks and forests such as the [[Ratargul Swamp Forest]], [[Rema-Kalenga Wildlife Sanctuary]]. Its burgeoning economy has contributed to the regional attractions of landscapes filled with fragrant orange and pineapple gardens as well as tea plantations. The region has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Am'') bordering on a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cwa'') at higher elevations. The rainy season from April to October is hot and humid with very heavy showers and thunderstorms almost every day, whilst the short dry season from November to February is very warm and fairly clear. Nearly 80% of the annual average rainfall of {{convert|4200|mm|in|-1}} occurs between May and September.<ref>[http://weather.msn.com/monthly_averages.aspx?wealocations=wc:BGXX0010&q=Sylhet%2c+BGD+forecast:averagesm Monthly Averages for Sylhet, BGD] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701141245/http://weather.msn.com/monthly_averages.aspx?wealocations=wc:BGXX0010&q=Sylhet%2c+BGD+forecast:averagesm |date=1 July 2019 }} MSN Weather.

The [[physiography]] of the division consists mainly of hill soils, encompassing a few large depressions known locally as "[[beel]]s" which can be mainly classified as [[oxbow lake]]s, caused by tectonic subsidence primarily during [[1762 Arakan earthquake|the earthquake of 1762]].<ref name=heads/>

Geologically, the division is complex having diverse sacrificial geomorphology; high topography of [[Pliocene|Plio]]-[[Miocene]] age such as the [[Khasi Hills|Khasi and Jaintia Hills]] and small hillocks along the border. At the centre there is a vast low laying flood plain of recent origin with saucer shaped depressions, locally called ''[[haor]]s''. There are many haors in the region and the largest ones include [[Hakaluki Haor|Hakaluki]], Kawadighi, [[Tanguar Haor|Tanguar]] and Hail. Available limestone deposits in different parts of the region suggest that the whole area was under the ocean in the [[Oligocene|Oligo]]-[[Miocene]]. In the last 150 years, three major earthquakes hit the city, at a magnitude of at least 7.5 on the [[Richter Scale]], the last one took place in 1918, although many people are unaware that Sylhet lies on an earthquake prone zone.<ref name="ds10Feb2006">{{cite news |last=Siddiquee |first=Iqbal |date=10 February 2006 |title=Sylhet growing as a modern urban centre |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/suppliments/2006/15thanniv/ourcities/ourcities24.htm |work=The Daily Star |access-date=25 May 2009 |archive-date=21 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721161221/http://archive.thedailystar.net/suppliments/2006/15thanniv/ourcities/ourcities24.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Flora and fauna ===
The region is home to the [[Asian elephant]] and the [[One-horned rhinoceros]], mostly towards the south. Tigers and leopards were once found throughout the region. Other notable fauna include the [[Sambar deer]], [[Indian hog deer]], [[Hara jerdoni|Sylhet hara]] and [[Sylhet roofed turtle]].<ref name=allen>{{cite book|title=Assam District Gazetteers|volume=2|year=1905|location=Calcutta|author=B C Allen|publisher=[[Government of Assam]]}}</ref>

The Asian elephant were once found in small numbers in places such as Chapghat, Bhanugach, Chamtolla, Mahram and the Raghunandan hills. More abundantly they are found near streams in Singla and Langai.<ref name=heads/>

===Language===
[[File:Sylheti Nagari Alphabet Monument.jpg|thumb|right|The "Nagari Chattar" (Nagari Square), built near Surma river in the city of [[Sylhet]], consists of the [[Sylheti Nagri]] script.]]
The official language of Sylhet is [[Bengali language|Bengali]], which is used in education and all government affairs in the division. [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]] is the most widely spoken in the division. At one point, the [[Sylheti Nagri]] script was notably popular in its use to write Islamic [[Puthi|puthis]]. The [[Adivasi|Adivasis]] and tea labourers brought over during the British colonial rule also have their own native languages such as [[Khasi language|Khasi]], [[Kuki language|Kuki]], [[Laleng|Laiunghtor]], [[Meitei language|Meitei]], [[Bishnupriya Manipuri language|Bishnupriya Manipuri]], [[Hajong language|Hajong]], [[Garo language|Garo]], [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Kurmi|Kurmi creole]], [[Hindi]], [[Bhumij language|Bhumij]] and [[Tripuri language|Tripuri]].<ref name=musahar>{{cite book|title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh|first=Subhash|last=Jengcham|chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Mushahar|chapter=Mushahar|publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]|access-date=28 May 2020|archive-date=11 July 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210711225929/https://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Mushahar|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Architecture===
{{See also|Bengali architecture|Islamic architecture|Mughal architecture}}
The intense building of mosques which took place during the Sultanate era indicates the rapidity with which the locals converted to Islam. Today, mosques are present in every Muslim-inhabited village. Bengali mosques are normally covered with several small domes and curved brick roofs decorated with [[terracotta]]. [[Ponds]] are often located beside a mosque.<ref name="Grabar1989">{{cite book|author=Oleg Grabar|author-link=Oleg Grabar|title=Muqarnas: An Annual on Islamic Art and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0NCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA58|year=1989|publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=978-90-04-09050-7|pages=58–72|access-date=13 May 2020|archive-date=22 October 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231022223953/https://books.google.com/books?id=O0NCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA58#v=onepage&q&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref>

The division's population is over 12 million and [[Bengalis]] make up a large majority of the region's population. The tribal and [[Adivasi]] population tend to live in secluded rural areas of the region primarily near the hills and tea gardens. They are made up of several ethnic groups such as the [[Bishnupriya Manipuri people|Bishnupriya Manipuri]]s, [[Khasi people|Khasi]], [[Laleng]]s, [[Tripuri people|Tripuri]]s, [[Meitei people|Meitei]]s, [[Garo people|Garo]]s, and [[Kuki people|Kuki]]s.

There is a very small minority of [[Shia Muslims]] who gather every year during [[Ashura]] for the [[Mourning of Muharram]] processions. Places of procession include the [[Prithimpassa Family|Prithimpasha Nawab Bari]] in [[Kulaura]], home to a royal Shia family, as well as [[Kamalganj Upazila|Rajtila]].

There was a presence of [[Sikhism]] in Sylhet after [[Guru Nanak]]'s visit in 1508 to spread the religion. [[Kahn Singh Nabha]] has stated that in memory of Nanak's visit, ''Gurdwara Sahib Sylhet'' was established.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}} This Gurdwara was visited twice by [[Tegh Bahadur]] and many [[hukamnama]]s were issued to this temple by [[Guru Gobind Singh]]. In 1897, the gurdwara fell down after the [[1897 Assam earthquake|earthquake]].
