==Culture==
Barrancabermeja's culture has been largely affected by the migratory movements caused by the oil boom. The city exhibits an amalgam of many regional customs from Colombia. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Due to its history as an oil town, the city is often visited by moneyed foreigners, often engineers and supervisory employees and technicians of oil companies.  Thus Barrancabermeja has a reputation as an open and vibrant city and may be somewhat cosmopolitan.

Barrancabermeja's night life includes [[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]] and [[Merengue (dance)|merengue]] dance clubs.  The city's culture presents a strong Caribbean influence that nevertheless is not exclusive of other cultural expressions from among the variety found in Colombia.  The predominant music in the city is [[vallenato]] and other Caribbean rhythms including [[papayera]].

Several local and national political organizations including unions, women's organizations, and human rights groups are active.  Marches and demonstrations are quite common and the oil workers union is among the most important in the nation.

The commercial area of the city is adjacent to the river port ("the Port") where motor boats and [[canoe]]s constantly arrive with [[fish]] and agricultural products from farmers along the river that include [[maize]], [[cassava]] (or ''yuca'' in Spanish), [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]], and [[Cocoa bean|cacao]].

In 1996 and 2000, Barrancabermeja hosted the Mundial de Patinaje, an international inline-skating competition.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.colombiasports.net/deportes/44-patinaje/1430-colombia-sera-sede-del-mundial-de-patinaje-2010.html | title=Colombia será sede del Mundial de Patinaje 2010 | access-date=15 February 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709090930/http://www.colombiasports.net/deportes/44-patinaje/1430-colombia-sera-sede-del-mundial-de-patinaje-2010.html | archive-date=July 9, 2011}}</ref>
