{{main|Constantia (Osrhoene)}}

According to the Byzantine historian [[John Malalas]], the city was built by the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine I]] on the site of former Maximianopolis, which had been destroyed by a Persian attack and an earthquake. During the next two centuries, it was an important location in the Roman/Byzantine Near East, playing a crucial role in the [[Roman–Persian Wars]] of the 6th century as the seat of the ''[[dux Mesopotamiae]]'' (363–540).<ref name="ODB"/> It was also a [[Diocese|bishopric]], suffragan of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]. [[Jacob Baradaeus]] was born near the city and was a monk in a nearby monastery.<ref name="ODB"/> The city was [[Early Muslim conquests|captured]] by the [[Arabs]] in 639.<ref name="ODB"/>

The city became the base for the Ottoman statesman of [[Kurds|Kurdish]] origin [[Ibrahim Pasha Milli|Ibrahim Pasha]], leader of the Kurdish [[Milan tribe]], in the late nineteenth century. Beginning in 1891, Ibrahim Pasha led several regiments of the state-sponsored tribal light cavalries known as the [[Hamidiye (cavalry)|Hamidiye Brigades]]. He enjoyed the favor of [[Abdul Hamid II|Sultan Abdul Hamid II]], and also extended protection to local Christian populations, with some 600 families taking up residence in the district by the early 1900s.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Social Relations in Ottoman Diyarbekir, 1870-1915|last = Jongerden|first = Joost|publisher = Brill|year = 2012|location = Leiden|pages = 62–65}}</ref> The British spy and diplomat [[Mark Sykes]] claimed that Ibrahim Pasha had also saved some 10,000 Christians in the midst of the [[Hamidian massacres|massacres]] of the 1890s.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Making of Modern Turkey: Nation and State in Eastern Anatolia, 1913-1950|last = Üngör|first = Uğur Ümit|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2011|location = New York|pages = 18}}</ref> The historian Janet Klein writes that "on the eve of the [[Young Turk Revolution]], Ibrahim Pasha was one of the most powerful figures in all of Kurdistan."<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Margins of Empire: Kurdish Militias in the Ottoman Tribal Zone|last = Klein|first = Janet|publisher = Stanford University Press|year = 2011|location = Stanford, Calif.|pages = 102}}</ref> Yet after the revolution, Ibrahim Pasha could no longer count on the support of the palace. He died on 27 September 1908 of dysentery, hotly pursued by Ottoman troops near [[Nusaybin]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Margins of Empire: Kurdish Militias in the Ottoman Tribal Zone|last = Klein|first = Janet|publisher = Stanford University Press|year = 2011|location = Stanford, Calif.|pages = 103–104}}</ref>

On the eve of World War I, Viranşehir's Armenian population of numbered 1,339. The city's [[Kaymakam|kaimakam]] apparently objected to May 1915 orders of raids on the population, but higher-ups eventually prevailed, and the entire population was massacred or sent to [[Ras al-Ayn Camps|Ras al-'Ayn]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Armenian Genocide: a Complete History|last = Kevorkian|first = Raymond|publisher = Tauris|year = 2011|location = New York|pages = 366}}</ref>
