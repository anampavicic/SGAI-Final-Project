'''Kuantan''' ([[Pahang Malay]]: ''Kontaeng''; [[Terengganu Malay]]: ''Kuatang/Kuantang''; [[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]: {{lang|ms-arab|{{Script|Arab|كوانتن}}}}) is a city and the state capital of [[Pahang]], Malaysia. It is located near the mouth of the Kuantan River. Kuantan is the [[Largest cities in Malaysia|14th largest city in Malaysia]] based on a 2020 population of 548,014 and the largest city on the [[Peninsular Malaysia#Other features|East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia]].

The administrative centre of the state of Pahang was officially relocated to Kuantan on 27 August 1955 from [[Kuala Lipis]], and was officiated by HRH [[Abu Bakar of Pahang|Sultan Abu Bakar Ri'ayatuddin Al Muadzam Shah]],<ref name="auto"/> the Sultan of Pahang.

==History==
{{more citations needed section|date=December 2023}}
Kuantan in the first century was a part of [[Chi Tu|Chih-Tu empire]]. In the 11th century, this piece of land was conquered by another small empire called Pheng-Kheng before being taken over by the Siamese during the 12th century. During the 15th century, Kuantan was ruled by the [[Malaccan Sultanate|Malaccan Empire]].

Kuantan is said to have been founded in the 1850s. The name was notably mentioned in [[Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir|Munshi Abdullah]]'s travelogue ''[[Kisah Pelayaran Abdullah ke Kelantan|Kisah Pelayaran ke Kelantan]]'' circa 1851/2:

{{blockquote|...On Thursday night came a boat from Kuantan. Then they told the ship's crew there's a pirate ship at ''Tanjung Tujuh'', forty of them and at [[Kapas Island]], and as well at [[Redang Island]]; it was spotted by two Kuantan boats and they set off...|author=|title=|source=}}

In its early days, it was known as ''Kampung Teruntum'' (lit. '[[Lumnitzera]] Village'). The village was situated at the mouth of [[Teruntum River]] which is in front of the current hospital and it was established by Haji Senik{{who|date=December 2023}} and his followers in the 1850s. Early primary economic activities included fishing and small businesses. The main evidence of the establishment of the village is the cemetery that is situated near [[Taman Esplanade, Kuantan|Taman Esplanade]] in front of the current [[Hospital Tengku Ampuan Afzan]].

Towards the late 19th century, arrival of [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] miners and traders saw the establishment of a township in Kuantan and nearby tin mining areas such as [[Gambang, Pahang|Gambang]] and [[Sungai Lembing]]. Similar to what occurred in other states in [[Peninsular Malaysia]], rubber plantations attracted [[Malaysian Indian|Indian]] settlers as well.

The [[sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sinking of HMS ''Prince of Wales'' and HMS ''Repulse'']] took place off the coast of Kuantan on 10 December 1941.

Kuantan was declared a full-fledged city by [[Sultan of Pahang|Sultan]] [[Abdullah of Pahang]] on 21 February 2021 and its town council officially renamed the Kuantan City Council (MBK).<ref>{{cite news |title=Kuantan is now a city |url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2021/02/21/kuantan-is-now-a-city |access-date=21 February 2021 |newspaper=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=21 February 2021}}{{page needed|date=December 2023}}</ref>

==Government==
The [[Pahang]] state government shifted the administrative centre of Pahang from [[Kuala Lipis]] to Kuantan in 1955. The urban area of Kuantan city is located mostly in the mukims of Kuala Kuantan and Beserah.

'''Kuantan City Council''', formerly known as the '''Kuantan Sanitary Board''' ({{langx|ms|Lembaga Kesihatan Kuantan}}) from 1913 until 1937, the '''Kuantan Town Board''' ({{langx|ms|Lembaga Bandaran Kuantan}}) from 1937 until 1953, the '''Kuantan Town Council''' ({{langx|ms|Majlis Bandaran Kuantan}}) from 1953 to 31 August 1979 and the '''Kuantan Municipal Council''' ({{langx|ms|Majlis Perbandaran Kuantan}}) from 1 September 1979 until 20 February 2021, is the local authority of Kuantan.

===Urban development===

==Climate==
Kuantan features a [[tropical rainforest climate]] under the [[Köppen climate classification]]. Usually, the area experiences two seasons per year, i.e., the "Dry" and Hot season and the Rainy season. The "Dry" and Hot Season (a relative term as the city does not truly have a [[dry season]]) occurs when seasonal south-west winds blow from Sumatra toward the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia but are blocked by the Titiwangsa Mountain Range. The temperature may reach 40 degrees Celsius. The Rainy season usually occurs between October and March. During this season, the north-east winds bring rain to Kuantan. It can get very cloudy with a large amount of rainfall. Floods may also occur. Areas subject to possible flooding include the road to Sungai Lembing and also a few areas along the Kuantan River.

In 2006, Kuantan experienced significant air pollution that affected visibility because of the [[2006 Southeast Asian haze|haze]] blowing in from [[Sumatra]] and the [[Peninsular Malaysia#East Coast and West Coast|West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia]].

===ECER Special Economic Zone (ECER SEZ)===
Kuantan is being identified as a [[Special Economic Zone]] (SEZ). The launch of SEZ in 2009 by Prime Minister [[Najib Tun Razak]] is one of the first of its kind in Malaysia. The SEZ is located inside [[East Coast Economic Region]] (ECER) of Greater Kuantan which stretches from the district of [[Kerteh|Kertih]], Terengganu to the district of [[Pekan]], Pahang. It is now one of the largest SEZs in Asia, covering 390,000 hectares. ECER SEZ serves as a catalyst to fast-track the economic development in the east coast. ECER SEZ aims to generate RM90&nbsp;billion of investments and provide over 90,000 new jobs by 2020. At the centre of southeast Asia with four seaports ([[Kuantan Port]] as the main gateway) and two airports, ECER SEZ will serve good transportation link between Indochina, India and China.
