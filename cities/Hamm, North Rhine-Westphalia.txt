'''Hamm''' ({{IPA|de|ˈham|-|De-Hamm.ogg}}, [[Latin]]: ''Hammona'') is a [[List of cities and towns in Germany|city]] in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]]. It is located in the northeastern part of the [[Ruhr area]]. As of 2016 its population was 179,397. The city is situated between the [[Bundesautobahn 1|A1 motorway]] and [[Bundesautobahn 2|A2 motorway]]. [[Hamm (Westfalen) railway station|Hamm railway station]] is an important hub for rail transport and renowned for its distinctive station building.

==History==

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms has been in use in its present form for about 750 years. It shows the markish chessboard ("märkischen Schachbalken") in red and silver on a golden field. Originally it was the founders' coat of arms, i. e. the Counts of Mark. The chessboard and the colours are often displayed in the coats of arms of further towns founded by that family line. Similarly, the colours of the city are red and white.

===Overview===
The name ''Ham'' means "corner" in the old [[Low German]] dialect spoken at that time. In the old times the name ''thom Hamme'' would be used, which evolved slowly into its modern form ''Hamm''. The name derives from the description of the Hamm's location in the corner of the Lippe river and the narrow Ahse affluent, where it was founded on Ash Wednesday in March 1226 by Count Adolf I of the [[Mark (county)|Mark]].

In the reorganisation of 1975, the following towns and municipalities were incorporated into the City of Hamm: {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

#The town of '''Bockum-Hövel''', Lüdinghausen district

==Miscellaneous==
In 2006 Hamm was the first city to accomplish a "Ratsbürgerentscheid" (literally: "council's citizens decision"). Subject of the plebiscite was a plan to build a 43 ha city lake (2007–2010) near the city centre. 136,521 citizens were entitled to vote, 57,563 used that possibility and 56.9% refused their approbation for the project. As minimal vote 20% (of the total 136,521 voters) had to decide between one of the possibilities (20% for Yes or 20% for NO). The city council accepted the voting and stopped the plans. 
This procedure is planned for future projects in NRW.
Also in Hamm established was the  "Baugerichtstag e. V." a society organizing a congress about the German building law. The congress is held in a two years term.

==Health==
The largest health facility is the Marien Hospital with its two separate buildings, Marien Hospital I the old building within the centre of the city and Marien Hospital II together 587 beds.  Then there is the (EVK Hamm) Evangelisches Krankenhaus Hamm (Protestant Hospital) combined with the children's hospital south of the centre together 493 beds, the St. Barbara Klinik (Clinic) in Heessen with 422 beds and the Malteser Krankenhaus (Hospital) St. Josef in Bockum-Hövel with 260 beds. Additional there are the Klinik für manuelle Therapie (Clinic for manual therapy) within the quarter {{ill|Bad Hamm|de}} (138 beds), the [[spa]] district. The Westfälisches Institut Hamm für Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie und psychotherapie (Westphalian Institute Hamm for Children's- and Youth psychiatry and psychotherapy) as an Institute of the federal state (158 beds) and the private Klinik (clinic) am Bärenbrunnen. (All [[Hospital]]s together have 2058 beds.)

==Education==
Hamm has six [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasien]] (grammar schools), two comprehensive schools and several [[Realschule]]n, [[Hauptschule]]n and Grundschulen ([[elementary school]]s). The oldest Gymnasium in Hamm is the Gymnasium Hammonense which was established as academic school (small university) with three faculties in 1657. The school declined in its importance and in 1781 merged with the local Latin school and got reformed by Prussia. The new combined school was humanist Gymnasium. In 1867 the "Märkisches Gymnasium" followed as the second Gymnasium of Hamm, in 1902 the "[[Freiherr vom Stein]] Gymnasium", in 1924 the "Beisenkamp Gymnasium" – first as "Oberlyceum" (Gymnasium for girls) – and in 1968 the  "[[Galilei]]-Gymnasium" was established as an offspring of the Gymnasium Hammonense. Additionally in Schloss Heessen there is a private school including the Gymnasium. Both comprehensive schools in Hamm are younger foundations by the city during school reforms of NRW.
Hamm is also well known for its many [[vocational school]]s: 
* "Eduard Spranger Berufskolleg für Technik" a vocational school for mostly industrial jobs
* "Elisabeth Lüders Berufskolleg für Sozialwesen, Gesundheit, Hauswirtschaft und Kinderpflege" a vocational school for social welfare, health, home economics and child care, and several other schools.
* "Friederich List Berufskolleg für Wirtschaft" a trade and economical school
In 2005 a small private university of applied sciences was established, the "SRH Fachhoschule Hamm".
The private university of applied sciences started with two study programs ending with degrees of Bachelor and Master of Science for [[logistic engineering]].
The "Klinik für Psychatrie und Psychotherapie of the Marienhospital" cooperates with the University Witten-Herdecke in education and science.
During the summer 2009 another university of applied sciences was founded by the federal state NRW, named Hochschule Hamm-Lippstadt. The university is divided in two departments, each with its own small Campus area, one in Hamm and another in [[Lippstadt]].

Major industrial branches are the [[coal-mining]] industry, [[steel industry]], [[chemical industry]] and the car component supplier industry.
In the last century there were four coal-mines within the urban district. Today the Bergwerk Ost in Herringen is the last operating coal mine with about 3,000 employees.
Mannesmann Hoesch Präzisrohr, Westfälische Draht Industrie (WDI) and Böhler Thyssen Welding are the major representatives of the steel industry, the chemical industry is represented by [[DuPont]] in Uentrop and the car supplier industry by Hella KGaA Hueck & Co. factory 4 in Bockum-Hövel with about 1000 employees.
The [[energy industry]] is represented by a [[RWE]] coal power plant and a further power plant (Trianel) in Uentrop. A new coal power plant is currently under construction. The [[THTR-300]], also in Uentrop-Schmehhausen, was decommissioned in 1989.
Alongside the A2, in the southern part of the urban district, a new business park inhabits the growing [[logistics]] business.
Hamm is also known as "City of Law" (Stadt des Rechts) because of the greatest German regional appeal court (Oberlandesgericht), the local court (Amtsgericht), the industrial court (Arbeitgericht) and the industrial appeal court (Landesarbeitsgericht).  The Chamber of Notaries and bar association of the regional appeal court Hamm and the courts are of greater influence on the appearance of the city.
Several hospitals in the urban district are also important employers, for example the EVK Hamm has about 1000 employees.

===Media===
The only daily newspaper of Hamm printed there, is the ''Westfälischer Anzeiger''. At first, a weekly newspaper in Hamm was the ''Kreis Hammsches Wochenblatt'' founded by Heinich Jakob Grote in 1822. Its name was changed in 1848 to ''Westfälischer Anzeiger''. A second newspaper appeared, founded by the Thiemann family, the ''Westfälische Kurier''. Both co-existed until the end of the Second World War. After the War both newspapers were combined and named ''Westfälischer Anzeiger und Kurier''. In the 1960s another name-change made the ''Westfälischer Anzeiger''. This newspaper is the mantle of several smaller regional newspapers; together, they had a total 153,428 copies in 2004. In the 1970s the ''Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung'' unsuccessfully tried to establish its own daily newspaper.

Two weekly newspapers appear in Hamm: the ''Stadtanzeiger'' from the ''Westfälischer Anzeiger'' with a total of 384.000 copies, and the ''Sonntags-Rundblick'' by a medium-sized local company.
