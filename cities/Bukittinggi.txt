'''Bukittinggi''' ({{langx|min|Bukiktinggi}}, [[Jawi script|Jawi]]: {{lang|ar|بوكيت تيڠڬي}}, formerly {{langx|nl|Fort de Kock}}) is the third largest city in [[West Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]], with a population of 111,312 in 2010<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 121,028 in 2020,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> and an official estimate as at mid 2023 of 124,047 - comprising 61,949 males and 62,098 females.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Bukittinggi Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.1375)</ref> It covers an area of 25.24&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref>[https://bukittinggikota.bps.go.id/publikasi.html BPS Kota Bukittinggi]</ref> It is located in the [[Minangkabau Highlands]], 90&nbsp;km by road from the West Sumatran capital city of [[Padang, Indonesia|Padang]]. The city is completely surrounded by the [[Agam Regency]] (Bukittinggi was its [[regency seat]] until 1998), making it an [[enclave and exclave|enclave]] within the regency, and it is located at {{Coord|0|18|20|S|100|22|9|E|}}, near the volcanoes [[Mount Singgalang]] (inactive) and [[Mount Marapi]] (still active). At 930 m above sea level, the city has a cool climate with temperatures between 16.1° to 24.9&nbsp;°C.

Bukittinggi used to be known as [[Fort de Kock]] and was once dubbed as '{{lang|nl|Parijs van Sumatera}}'. The city was the [[capital of Indonesia]] during the [[Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia]] (PDRI). Before it became the capital of PDRI, the city was a centre of government at the time of the Dutch East Indies and during the Japanese colonial period.

Bukittinggi is also known as a leading tourist city in West Sumatra. It is twinned with [[Seremban]] in [[Negeri Sembilan]], [[Malaysia]]. The [[Jam Gadang]], a clock tower located in the heart of the city, is a symbol for the city and a well-visited tourist spot.

The city is the birthplace of [[Mohammad Hatta]], Indonesian co-proclamator and [[Assaat]], then Indonesian (acting) president. Koto Gadang, a village in the southwest of the city, produces an abundance of statesmen, ministers, doctors, economist, artist and scholars who make great contribution to Indonesia, namely [[Sutan Sjahrir]], [[Agus Salim]], [[Bahder Djohan]], [[Rohana Kudus]], [[Emil Salim]], [[Syahrir|Dr. Syahrir]], etc.

==History==
The city has its origins in five villages that served as the basis for a marketplace.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Indonesian Town Revisited |last=Nas |first=Peter J. M. |year=2002 |publisher=LIT Verlag |isbn=978-3-8258-6038-7}}</ref> It was known as [[Fort de Kock]] in colonial times in reference to the Dutch outpost established here in 1825 during the [[Padri War]]. 

The fort was founded by Captain Bauer at the top of Jirek hill and later named after the then [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies|Lieutenant Governor-General]] of the [[Dutch East Indies]], [[Hendrik Merkus de Kock]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Indonesian Houses |year=2004 |last=Domenig |author2=Nas, P |author3-link=Reimar Schefold |author3=Schefold, Reimar |first=Gaudenz |publisher=National University of Singapore Press |isbn=978-9971-69-292-6}}</ref> The first road connecting the region with the west coast was built between 1833 and 1841 via the Anai Gorge, easing troop movements, cutting the costs of transportation and providing an economic stimulus for the agricultural economy.<ref>{{cite journal |title=A Moving History of Middle Sumatra, 1600–1870 |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=1–38 |journal=Modern Asian Studies |year=2005 |last=Colombijn |first=Freek |doi=10.1017/S0026749X04001374|s2cid=146399326 |url=https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/16df8c23-a7d9-4cf6-b012-076a27ae81d9 }}</ref> 

In 1856 a teacher-training college (''Kweekschool'') was founded in the city, the first in Sumatra, as part of a policy to provide education opportunities to the indigenous population.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mission Schools in Batakland (Indonesia), 1861-1940 |last=Aritonang |first=Jan S. |publisher=BRILL |year=1994 |isbn=978-90-04-09967-8}}</ref> A rail line connecting the city with Payakumbuh and Padang was constructed between 1891 and 1894.<ref>{{cite web |author=Krishnamurti, Indra |title=History of Railways in Indonesia |date=9 December 2004 |url=http://keretapi.tripod.com/history.html |access-date=3 October 2007}}</ref>

During the [[Japanese occupation of West Sumatra]] in [[World War II]], the city was the headquarters for the Japanese 25th Army, the force that occupied [[Sumatra]]. The headquarters was moved to the city in April 1943 from [[Singapore]] and remained until the Japanese surrender in August 1945.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Some preliminary observations on West Sumatra during the revolution |last=Kahin |first=Audrey |journal=Indonesia |issue=Oct |year=1974 |pages=76–117 |doi=10.2307/3350695 |volume=18 |jstor=3350695 |hdl=1813/53591 |hdl-access=free }}</ref>

[[File:Masjid Raya Bukittinggi Okt 2020.jpg|left|thumbnail|[[Mosque]] in central Bukittinggi]]
During the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], the city saw a [[3 March affair|failed coup attempt]] by Islamist militias against the Indonesian republican government in 1947.<ref>{{cite book |title=Kronik revolusi Indonesia |publisher=Kepustakaan Populer Gramedia |isbn=978-979-9023-46-9 |page=57 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z9C7NuTllisC&pg=PA57 |language=id}}</ref> During the second 'Police Action' Dutch forces invaded and occupied the city on 22 December 1948, having earlier bombed it in preparation.

The city was officially renamed Bukittinggi in 1949, replacing its colonial name. From 1950 until 1957, Bukittinggi was the capital city of a province called Central Sumatra, which encompassed [[West Sumatra]], [[Riau]] and [[Jambi]]. In February 1958, during a revolt in Sumatra against the Indonesian government, rebels proclaimed the [[Pemerintah Revolusioner Republik Indonesia|Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia]] (PRRI) in Bukittinggi. The Indonesian government had recaptured the town by May the same year.

A group of [[Muslim]] men had planned to bomb a cafe in the city frequented by foreign tourists in October 2007, but the plot was aborted due to the risk of killing Muslim individuals in the vicinity.<ref>{{cite web |title=S'porean admits terror plot |date=21 January 2009 |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/SE%2BAsia/Story/STIStory_328916.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130035526/http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking+News/SE+Asia/Story/STIStory_328916.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 January 2009 |access-date=14 February 2009 }}</ref> Since 2008, the city administration has banned [[Valentine's Day]] and [[New Year]]'s celebrations as they consider them not in line with Minangkabau traditions or Islam that can lead to "immoral acts" such as young couples hugging and kissing.<ref>{{cite web |author=Syofiardi Bachyul Jb |title=Valentine's celebrations banned in Bukittinggi |date=14 February 2008  |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/02/14/valentine039s-celebrations-banned-bukittinggi.html |access-date=14 February 2009}}</ref>

==Transportation==
Bukittinggi is connected to [[Padang, Indonesia|Padang]] by road. Up until early 1980s, there was a railway service from [[Padang Panjang]] that used to serve the city. For inner-city transport, Bukittinggi employs a public transportation system known as "Mersi" (Merapi Singgalang) and "IKABE" that connect locations within the city. The city preserves the traditional horse-cart widely known in the area as ''Bendi'', although the use is limited and more popular with tourists, both domestic and foreign.

==Tourism==
[[File:Bukittinggi.jpeg|left|thumbnail|Bukittinggi at Holiday Season]]
It is a city popular with tourists due to the climate and central location. Bukittinggi is also a popular shopping destination due to cheap textile and fashion products, especially for [[Malaysia]]n. Best way to see Bukittinggi is by motorbike, car or by foot (trekkings). Attractions within the city include:
