'''Jowhar''' ({{langx|so|Jowhar}}, {{langx|ar|جوهر}}, [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Giohar'') is the capital city of [[Hirshabelle]] state of [[Somalia]]. Jowhar is also the administrative capital of [[Middle Shabelle]] [[Regions of Somalia|region]] of [[Somalia]]. 

Along with [[Baidoa]], it used to form the joint administrative capital of the [[Transitional Federal Government]], which it captured from the [[Islamic Courts Union]].

The city lies 90&nbsp;km (50&nbsp;mi) along a major road north of the national capital of [[Mogadishu]].

==History==
During the Middle Ages, Jowhar and much of the surrounding area in southern Somalia was governed by the [[Ajuran Sultanate|Ajuran Empire]].<ref name="Cassanelli">Lee V. Cassanelli, ''The Shaping of Somali Society: Reconstructing the History of a Pastoral People, 1600-1900'', (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1982), p.102.</ref> The town later came under the administration of the  [[Hiraab Imamate]] in the late 17th century after the collapse of the powerful [[Ajuran Empire]]. At the turn of the 20th century, Jowhar was incorporated into [[Italian Somaliland]]. After independence in 1960, the city was made the center of the official [[Jowhar District]].

===Villaggio Duca degli Abruzzi===
[[File:Albergo1938villaggioducaabruzzi.png|thumb|left|Jowhar Albergo Hotel 1938]] 

The Villaggio Duca degli Abruzzi was founded by a senior member of the [[House of Savoy|Italian Royal Family]], [[His Royal Highness|H.R.H.]] [[Prince|Principe]] [[Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi|Luigi Amedeo, Duca degli Abruzzi]] in 1920, who first came to the African continent in 1905 and liked the place. The [[Royal duke|Duke]] raised funds to build dams, roads, a [[Mogadishu–Villabruzzi Railway|railway]], schools, hospitals, a church and a [[mosque]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimateitaly.com/peoples/luigi-amedeo-giuseppe-maria-ferdinando-francesco.html |title=Luigi Amedeo - Biography & Achievements |access-date=2013-11-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722150256/http://www.ultimateitaly.com/peoples/luigi-amedeo-giuseppe-maria-ferdinando-francesco.html |archive-date=2012-07-22 }}</ref>

The village called [[Villaggio Duca degli Abruzzi]] (or ''Villabruzzi'') was founded as an agricultural settlement in [[Italian Somalia]] experimenting with new cultivation techniques.{{cn|date=June 2020}} In 1926, the colony comprised 16 villages, with some 3,000 [[Somali people|Somali]] and 200 [[Italian people|Italian]] inhabitants.{{cn|date=June 2020}} It was commonly known as ''Villabruzzi''.{{cn|date=June 2020}}

Starting around 1911, [[Italian people|Italian]]s like the Duca degli Abruzzi started to take the local farmers and resettle them in specific new villages in an attempt to improve the economy of Italian Somalia. The area around Villabruzzi was the most agriculturally developed of Somalia before [[World War II]] and had some food industries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xoomer.alice.it/fernandotermentini/somalia.htm|title=SOMALIA UN PAESE DIMENTICATO|website=xoomer.alice.it|access-date=6 April 2018}}</ref>

==Administrative capital==
As part of a 2004 agreement, Jowhar and the town of [[Baidoa]] were to form a joint administrative capital of the [[Transitional Federal Government]], sited away from Mogadishu for security reasons. Continued fighting threatened to derail the peace process. However, in July 2005, President [[Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed]] relocated to the town from his base in [[Bosaso]], moving the process forward and joining Prime Minister [[Ali Mohammed Ghedi]], who had already been resident in the town for a month. Part of the parliament became based in Jowhar, while some ministries were established in Mogadishu.<ref name=VOA>[http://www.voiceofafricaradio.com/newsdetails.php?id=307 ''Interim Somali government to relocate to Baidoa and Jowhar''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622155205/http://www.voiceofafricaradio.com/newsdetails.php?id=307 |date=2006-06-22 }}, [[Voice of Africa Radio|Voice of Africa]], 23 March 2005</ref> By February 2006, despite Ghedi's security concerns, the two leaders had left to Baidoa, where it was decided the parliament would convene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4667096.stm|title=Somali PM unhappy with new deal|date=6 April 2018|access-date=6 April 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

==Demographics==
The district had estimated population of 269,851 as of 2014, a survey was done by (UNDP) in 2014 and it is primarily inhabited by Abgal clan.<ref name="reliefweb1">{{cite web|url=http://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/jowhar-semi-quantitative-evaluation-access-and-coverage-squeac-22st-december-2016-9th |title=Jowhar Semi-Quantitative Evaluation of Access and Coverage (SQUEAC) - 22st December 2016 to 9th January 2017 - Final Report - Somalia &#124; ReliefWeb |publisher=Reliefweb.int |date=2017-01-09 |access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref>
