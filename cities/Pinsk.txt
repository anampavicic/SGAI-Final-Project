===WWI and Polish–Soviet War===
[[File:FlotyllaPinsk.jpg|thumb|Polish [[river monitors]] in Pinsk (before 1926)]]Pinsk was occupied by the [[German Empire]] on 15 September 1915, during the [[First World War]]. After the German defeat, Pinsk became the subject of dispute between the [[Belarusian People's Republic]] and the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], both short-lived. Pinsk was taken by the advancing Red Army on 25 January 1919, during the [[Soviet westward offensive of 1918–19]]. It was retaken by Polish troops on 5 March 1919 during the [[Polish–Soviet War]] but was retaken by the Red Army on 23 July 1920 and finally retaken by the Polish on 26 September 1920. Pińsk became part of the reborn [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] in 1920 when the Polish-Soviet War ended with the [[Peace of Riga]], signed in March 1921.<ref>[[Norman Davies]] (2003). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=DMoPXktGwiUC&dq=Riga+an+act+of+cowardice&pg=PA399 White Eagle, Red Star: the Polish-Soviet War, 1919–20.]'' Pimlico. p. 399. {{ISBN|0-7126-0694-7}}. (First edition: New York, St. Martin's Press, inc., 1972.)</ref>

Like many other cities in Eastern Europe, Pinsk had a significant Jewish population before World War II. According to the [[Russian census of 1897]], out of the total number of 28,400 inhabitants, Jews were approximately 74% of the population (21,100 persons), making it one of the most Jewish cities under tsarist rule.<ref>[[Joshua D. Zimmerman]] (2004), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6sbr9cZyw_4C&dq=population+Brest+Poles+Jews&pg=PA16 Poles, Jews, and the Politics of Nationality.]'' University of Wisconsin Press, {{ISBN|0-299-19464-7}}, Google Books preview, p. 16.</ref> During the Polish-Soviet War, 35 Jewish civilians from Pinsk were executed by the Polish Army in April 1919 after being accused of collaborating with Russian [[Bolsheviks]]. The incident, known as the [[Pinsk massacre]], created a diplomatic crisis noted at the [[Versailles Conference]].<ref name=Wodzinski>''Best of the memory books'', Marcin Wodzinski, ''[[Haaretz]]'', Books, February 2009, pp. 28–30</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Davies |first=Norman |title=White eagle, red star: the Polish-Soviet war, 1919-20 |date=1972 |publisher=Macdonald and Co |isbn=0-356-04013-5 |location=London |oclc=519797}}{{RP|49}}</ref>

===Interwar period===
Pińsk was the initial capital of the [[Polesie Voivodeship]], but it moved to Brześć-nad-Bugiem (now [[Brest, Belarus]]) after a citywide fire on 7 September 1921. The population of the city grew rapidly in interwar Poland from 23,497 in 1921 to 33,500 in 1931. Pińsk became a bustling commercial centre, and 70% of the population was [[Polish Jews|Jewish]], in spite of considerable migration.<ref>{{cite web |title= Original film footage: "In the land of rivers and bogs" newsreel chronicle |trans-title= W krainie rzek i moczarów |id= Sygnatura: MF.271 Data wydania: 1936.

===Second World War===
Following the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] in 1939, Pinsk and the surrounding area was annexed to the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. It was the seat of the [[Pinsk Region|Pinsk Oblast]] from 1940.

After [[Operation Barbarossa]], Germany [[Eastern Front (World War II)#Repression and genocide in occupied territories|occupied Pinsk]] from 4 July 1941 to 14 July 1944, as part of the [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]]. Most Jews were killed in late October 1942 during the liquidation of the [[Pińsk Ghetto]] by the German ''[[Ordnungspolizei#Police Battalions|Ordnungspolizei]]'' and the [[Byelorussian Auxiliary Police]],<ref name=Wodzinski/> 10,000 being murdered in one day. In 1945, after postwar border adjustments of Poland, Pinsk again became part of the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]].

===Post-WWII and independence===
In 1954 it became part of the [[Brest Voblast]].

Pinsk has formed part of [[Belarus|the Republic of Belarus]] since Belarusian independence from the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991.

==Landmarks==
Three main sights of the town are lined along the river: the Assumption Cathedral of the Monastery of the [[Conventual Franciscans|Greyfriars]] (1712–1730), with a campanile from 1817, the Jesuit collegium (1635–1648); a large Mannerist complex, whose cathedral was demolished after [[World War II]] by communists; and the Butrymowicz Palace (1784–1790), built for Mateusz Butrymowicz, an important political and economical figure of Pinsk and Polesie. The Church of St. Charles Borromeo (1770—1782) and St. Barbara Cathedral of the Monastery of the St. Bernard Order (1786–1787) are placed near historic centre in the former Karolin suburb, which is now part of Pinsk. The foremost modern building is the black-domed Orthodox Cathedral of St. Theodore.
