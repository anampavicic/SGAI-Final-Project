'''Baja California Sur''' ({{IPA|es|ˈbaxa kaliˈfoɾnja ˈsuɾ|-|BajaCaliforniaSur.ogg}}; 'South Lower California'), officially '''Estado Libre y Soberano de Baja California Sur''' ({{langx|en|Free and Sovereign State of Baja California Sur}}), is the least populated state and the last state to be admitted to [[Mexico]], in 1974. It is also the ninth-largest Mexican state in terms of area.

Before becoming a state on 8 October 1974, the area was known as the ''El Territorio Sur de Baja California'' ("South Territory of Lower California"). It has an area of {{cvt|73909|km2|sqmi|0}}, or 3.57% of the land mass of Mexico, and occupies the southern half of the [[Baja California Peninsula]], south of the [[28th parallel north|28th parallel]], plus the uninhabited [[Rocas Alijos]] in the Pacific Ocean. It is bordered to the north by the state of [[Baja California]], to the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]], and to the east by the [[Gulf of California]]. The state has maritime borders with [[Sonora]] and [[Sinaloa]] to the east, across the Gulf of California.

The state is home to the tourist resorts of [[Cabo San Lucas]] and [[San José del Cabo]]. Its largest city and capital is [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]].

==Etymology==
{{Main article|Etymology of California}}
The state is named after the peninsula on which it is found, Baja (Lower) California, with the term "Sur" meaning "south". The name California applied to this peninsula along with the area now known as the state of California in the United States.<ref name="historiabcs" /><ref>The name "California" was applied to the western new world by Spanish explorers in the 16th century, probably a reference to a mythical land described in a popular novel of the time: Las Sergas de Esplandián.</ref> The coat of arms emphasizes the state's connection to the sea, including images of silver fish, a silver shell and a blue background.<ref name="historychannel" />

==History==
===Pre-Columbian era===
[[File:Mujeres californias.jpg|thumb|left|California women, probably [[Pericúes]], 1726]]
Japanese archaeologist [[Harumi Fujita (archaeologist)|Harumi Fujita]], who has been excavating the Cape Region since 1985, has carbon-dated remains from the Babisuri Shelter on the [[Isla Espíritu Santo]] to 40,000 years ago, placing the earliest habitation date in the [[Archaic period (North America)|Archaic period]], though the majority of remains indicate indigenous people have constantly occupied the area from between 10,000 and 21,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ibarra |first=Carlos |title= Localizan vestigios de etnias antiguas de BCS en isla Espíritu Santo |url=http://www.bcsnoticias.mx:80/localizan-vestigios-de-etnias-antiguas-de-bcs-en-isla-espiritu-santo/ |access-date=3 April 2018 |publisher=BCS Noticias |date=2 August 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140805003817/http://www.bcsnoticias.mx/localizan-vestigios-de-etnias-antiguas-de-bcs-en-isla-espiritu-santo/ |archive-date=5 August 2014 |location= La Paz, Baja California Sur, Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Vestiges of ancient ethnic groups from BCS located on Espiritu Santo Island |url-status= dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Sánchez |first=Guadalupe |title=Los Primeros Mexicanos: Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene People of Sonora |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6thwCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA16 |volume=Anthropological Papers of the University of Arizona Number 76 |year=2016 |publisher=[[University of Arizona Press]] |location=Tucson, Arizona |isbn=978-0-8165-3063-2 |page=16 |access-date=2018-04-04 |archive-date=2020-07-26 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200726144651/https://books.google.com/books?id=6thwCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA16 |url-status=live}}</ref> Evidence of early human habitation is found in primitive rock and cave paintings dating to 1700 BCE, created by hunting and gathering societies that lived in rock shelters. The state is one of five areas in the world with important concentrations of cave paintings. These paintings have an identifiable style and tend to be on a monumental scale with some figures as tall as {{convert|4|m}}. Most of the animals are painted in silhouette and depicted in movement, often being hunted by people. The best known site is the Great Mural Rock Art, which dates from 1700 BCE, located in the north of the state. Other important sites include Cueva de Palma, San Gregorio, Santa Teresa, Guadalupe, San Francisco, Cabo Pulmo, Santiago and San Borjita.<ref name="historiabcs" /><ref name="historychannel" /> The most important concentrations are in twelve square kilometer zone in the north of the state, centered on the Sierra de San Francisco. In sites near Comondú, Las Palmas and Cocheros, there are also arrowheads, utensils and petroglyphs.<ref name= geografia/> Las Palmas contains secondary burials of human bones painted with red ochre.<ref name="historychannel" />

When the Spanish arrived, there were four main ethnic groups: the [[Pericúes]] in the south between Cabo San Lucas and La Paz, the [[Guaycura people|Guaycuras]] in the area north of the Pericú to Loreto, the [[Monqui]]s near Loreto and [[Cochimí people|Cochimí]] in the middle of the peninsula. All were hunter/gatherers without agriculture or metalworking, but produced pottery. They also fished, but only the Pericúes had rafts.<ref name="historychannel" />

[[File:1632 Cardona Descripcion Indias (153).jpg|thumb|left|Spanish map of La Paz in 1632 written by Spanish captain [[Nicolás de Cardona]] after his expedition of 1614.]]
[[File:Misión de Nuestra Señora de Loreto. Siglo XVIII.jpg|thumb|left|[[Misión de Nuestra Señora de Loreto Conchó]] lithograph in the 18th century, is the first successful of [[Spanish missions in Baja California|Baja California missions]]]]
The first Spaniard in the area is believed to be [[Fortún Ximénez]], arriving in 1533. He and his crew did not remain long because they sacked the area's pearls and abused the women, prompting a violent confrontation with the natives, who killed Ximénez. The remaining crew returned to [[Mexico City]] with the pearls and stories of riches.<ref name="historiabcs" /><ref name="historychannel" />

In 1535, [[Hernán Cortés]] navigated into the Gulf of California, which he called the ''Sea of Cortés''. He landed in what is now the bay of La Paz, which he named the Santa Cruz Port and Valley. This event is celebrated in La Paz as its founding.<ref name="historiabcs" /> However, he did not remain.<ref name="historychannel" />

Despite various explorations, the remoteness of the region impeded efforts at colonization until the 17th century. In 1697, [[Jesuit]] missionary [[Juan María de Salvatierra]] established the [[Misión de Nuestra Señora de Loreto Conchó|Nuestra Señora de Loreto Conchó Mission]], the first permanent one of its kind in Baja California Sur. From there the order spread through most of the current state, founding sixteen missions in territory of the current state to work among the [[Pericú]], [[Guaycura people|Guaycura]] and [[Cochimí]] peoples.<ref name="historiabcs" /><ref name="historychannel" />

During the 18th century, more colonists arrived, bringing diseases that caused a significant decrease in the indigenous population.<ref name="historychannel" />

In 1768, the Jesuits were expelled from [[New Spain]] and the Franciscans took over the missions, continuing the expansion north. In 1773 they were replaced by the Dominicans.<ref name="historiabcs" /><ref name="historychannel" /> A number of these mission churches still survive, including the Loreto Mission, the [[Cathedral of La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz Cathedral]], the [[San José del Cabo Mission]] and the [[San Javier Mission]].<ref name="historiabcs" />

===19th century===
{{See also|Mexican–American War|Battle of La Paz}}
[[File:Marines-la-paz-sm.jpg|thumb|Marines raising the American flag over La Paz after the surprise [[Battle of La Paz]] near [[Mexican–American War]] end, 1847.]]
[[File:Barcos descargando 2, El Boleo.jpg|thumb|Ships docking in the waterfront of [[El Boleo]] mine in present-day [[Santa Rosalía, Baja California Sur|Santa Rosalía]].]]
The missions' influence had waned by the start of the nineteenth century, with most closing. However, many of the mission facilities became the centers for ranching operations and some agriculture. Without the protection of the monks, and the lack of governmental control, the indigenous peoples of this time were abused by the ranchers.<ref name="historiabcs" />

In the early 19th century, Baja California was divided into four municipalities, Loreto, San José del Cabo, San Pedro Mártir and Santa Gertrudis.<ref name="historiabcs" />

The southern peninsula's isolation kept it out of the fighting during the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. Although this war ended in 1821, the remoteness of the area allowed the Spanish to maintain control of the southern peninsula until 1822. Afterwards, it was divided into four municipalities by [[Guadalupe Victoria]] and governor José María Echendía.<ref name="historiabcs" /><ref name="historychannel" />

Loreto was the original capital of the peninsula until 1830, when destruction of the town by heavy rains forced the government's relocation to La Paz, which has been the capital since.<ref name="historiabcs" /><ref name="historychannel" />

The United States invaded the peninsula during the [[Mexican–American War]] and wanted it as part of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], but the Mexican government succeeded in keeping control of the territory. In 1853, [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] and 45 other Americans [[Republic of Baja California|captured La Paz]]. However, due to lack of official U.S. support they were quickly driven out by Mexican forces.<ref name="historiabcs" /><ref name="historychannel" />

During the [[Reform War]], Liberal forces under General Manuel Marquez de Leon and others captured La Paz. French forces then invaded the country to support the Conservative cause, and Governor Felix Gilbert recognized [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian]]. However, Mexican forces under [[Benito Juarez]] forced the French out, with Coronel Clodomiro Cota, recapturing the peninsula from the French.<ref name="historiabcs" />

The division of the peninsula into north and south occurred in 1888 by the federal government under [[Porfirio Diaz]].<ref name="historychannel" />

===20th century to present===
During the regime of Porfirio Diaz (1876 to 1910), the Mexican government invited foreign enterprises to enter the country to develop it. In Baja California, these included mining operations including a major French mine called [[El Boleo]] (near Santa Rosalia) and the establishment of maritime routes. This president also divided the peninsula into two parts, each with its own government.<ref name="historiabcs" />

The south of the peninsula was not involved in the [[Mexican Revolution]] until after the assassination of [[Francisco I. Madero]], when troops were organized in opposition to [[Victoriano Huerta]], his successor under Félix Ortega. These troops defeated federal troops in 1914 and took over La Paz.<ref name="historiabcs" />

From the end of the Mexican Revolution to 1974, the territory had ten governors appointed by the federal government. The division of the peninsula was further formalized in 1931, with a highway extending its length the same year. Infrastructure development remained a priority for the area, with the establishment of schools including the first teachers' college in 1942, and projects to provide water and electricity.<ref name="historiabcs" />

The southern territory became a state on 8 October 1974, with three municipalities: La Paz, Comondú and Mulegé. Two others have been carved out since then, Los Cabos (1981) and Loreto (1992).<ref name="historiabcs" /><ref name="historychannel" />

==Geography==
[[File:TheArchCaboSanLucas01.JPG|thumb|upright|The arch at Land's End, Cabo San Lucas]]
The state is on a narrow peninsula that broke away from the mainland about two million years ago due to tectonic activity.<ref name="historiabcs">{{cite web |title=Historia |publisher=State of Baja California Sur |url=http://www.bcs.gob.mx/index.php/2013-01-09-18-42-56 |access-date=August 13, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803024910/http://www.bcs.gob.mx/index.php/2013-01-09-18-42-56 |archive-date=August 3, 2014}}</ref> The territory is primarily mountains or mountain ranges and coastal plains. The mountain ranges parallel the coastline and are of volcanic rock. The local name for the main mountain range is the [[Sierra de la Giganta]] and the highest peak is the [[Sierra de la Laguna]] at 2080m above sea level. The coastal plains are significantly wider on the Pacific side, averaging about 40&nbsp;km, with much wider plains such as those of Santa Clara, Berrendo and Magdalena y Hiray. These areas are dominated by sedimentary rock, especially limestone of marine origin.<ref name="encmuc" /><ref name="geografia">{{cite web |title=Geografía |publisher=State of Baja California Sur |url=http://www.bcs.gob.mx/index.php/2013-01-09-18-42-54 |access-date=August 13, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803034823/http://www.bcs.gob.mx/index.php/2013-01-09-18-42-54 |archive-date=August 3, 2014 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The state is divided into five regions: Central Desert, La Serranía, the [[Vizcaíno Desert]], the Magdalena Plains and Los Cabos. The Central Desert has desert plants, with vegetation springing up during short and irregular rains. The La Serranía is the high mountain areas with significant tree cover, some species of which are commercially valuable. The Vizcaíno Desert runs along the Pacific coast around the Ojo de Liebre and San Ignacio lagoons; it contains lower mountain ranges such as the San Francisco, San Alberto, Las Tinajas de Murillo and El Serrucho, along with the El Azufre and Las Vírgenes volcanos. The Magdalena Plains is a large, flat area near the Pacific coast, and the Los Cabos region is distinguished by microclimates determined by the geologic change in the area and rain patterns.<ref name="encmuc" />

The climate of the state is dry, with an average annual temperature of 18–22&nbsp;°C and average annual rainfall of less than 200mm.<ref name="geopob" /> The lower elevations are the driest and hottest, with summer daytime temperatures above 40&nbsp;°C; wintertime temperatures may fall below freezing. The exception to desert conditions is the Los Cabos region, classified as semi-moist because of Pacific hurricane activity affecting the region. In the spring, prevailing winds are from the west and in the summer from the south and southwest. In the fall, they are from the northwest and in the winter from the north and northwest.<ref name="encmuc" /><ref name="geografia" />

Most of the surface water is in the form of seasonal streams, which are fast-flowing and only active during stormy weather. Most of these drain into the Pacific Ocean, with a number flowing south into the Bahía de Ballenas.<ref name="geografia" />

[[File:EsteroSanJose18.JPG|thumb|left|View of the San Jose Estuary]]

The main geological feature of the state is its coastline, which measures 2230&nbsp;km, making it Mexico's longest with 22% of the total. It also has the most islands, mostly in the Gulf of California. There are three in the Pacific, Natividad, Magdalena and Santa Margarita (the largest). In the Gulf of California, they include San Marcos, Coronados, Carmen, Montserrat, Santa Catalina, Santa Cruz, San Diego, San Jose, San Francisco, Partida, Espiritu Santo and Cerralvo. Major bays include Sebastian Vizcaino, Magdalena, La Paz, Asunción, Ballenas, Concepcion and San Carlos. Estuaries and lagoons including those at Puerto Escondido, Nopoló, Balandra as well as the San José estuary at Cabo Colorado, the San Ignacio Lagoon and the Ojo de Liebre.<ref name="encmuc" /><ref name="geografia" /><ref name="historychannel">{{cite web |title=Baja California Sur |publisher=History Channel |url=http://www.history.com/topics/mexico/baja-california-sur |access-date=August 13, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811225801/http://www.history.com/topics/mexico/baja-california-sur |archive-date=August 11, 2014}}</ref>

The ecological system here is considered to be recently evolved with a number of endemic species.<ref name="encmuc" /> The lower elevations are dominated by desert and arid condition plants. This includes the world's largest species of cactus, the [[Pachycereus pringlei|cardón cactus]], which can reach heights of 15m.<ref name="historychannel" /> Other plant species include [[mesquite]], [[chironola]], [[lechuguilla]], [[Opuntia|nopal]] and barrel cactus, choyas, paloadan and [[pitahaya]]. The higher elevations have forests of pine and [[Quercus agrifolia|holm oak]] with some deciduous forests, with leaves falling in the dry season, generally no taller than fifteen meters.<ref name="geografia" /> Wildlife in the desert areas is restricted to birds, reptiles and small-to-medium mammals such as rabbits and coyotes. Upper elevations with more vegetation can have wild sheep, pumas and other wild cats, raccoons, deer, and foxes. Marine species include whales, seals, dolphins, gray whales, manta rays and sea turtles.<ref name="encmuc" /><ref name="historiabcs" /><ref name="geografia" />

Baja California Sur has the largest protected surface area in Mexico, 38.3% of the state in 10 official protected areas: [[Bahía de Loreto National Park]] (510,472.2 acres), [[Cabo Pulmo National Park]] (17'570 acres), [[Espíritu Santo]] Archipelago National Park (120,228.70 acres), [[El Vizcaíno Biosphere Reserve]] (6,293,255.76 acres), [[Ojo de Liebre Lagoon]] Bioshere Reserve (196,026.15 acres), [[Sierra de la Laguna]] Biosphere Reserve (277,838.05 acres), [[Balandra]] Protection Area of Flora and Fauna (6,209.09 acres) and [[Cabo San Lucas]] Protection Area of Flora and Fauna (9,874.42 acres). Also, the islands located in Baja California Sur coastline on the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of California are protected under [[Pacific Islands of the Baja California Peninsula]] Biosphere Reserve with Baja California, and [[Islands of the Gulf of California]] Protection Area of Flora and Fauna, which shares with the states of Baja California, Sinaloa and Sonora.<ref name="encmuc" /><ref name="geografia" />

==Culture==
[[File:Todos Santos ceramics (8776683890).jpg|thumb|Local religious pottery, [[Todos Santos, Baja California Sur|Todos Santos]]]]
Three of the indigenous cultures remain, the [[Cochimí]], the [[Guaycura people|Guaycura]] and the [[Pericú]]. Traditional music is usually played by trios playing an accordion and two guitars in bands called "cochi", in styles such as [[corrido]]s, waltzes, polkas and [[mazurka]]s along with [[norteño (music)|norteño]].<ref name="encmuc" /><ref name="geografia" /><ref name="historychannel" /> Traditional dress for women includes a semicircular red skirt decorated with local flora, along with a flowered blouse. This is most often seen at festivals where traditional dances such as Las Pitahayas, El Conejo, El Apasionado, El Chaverán, La Yuca, La Cuera, Las Calabazas and El Tupé are performed.<ref name="encmuc" />
Because of the long coastline, much of the state's cuisine is based on seafood, including species not normally eaten in other parts of Mexico such as manta rays. [[Oregano]] and a local herb called [[damiana]] are common seasonings. The latter is also used as a flavoring for a local liquor. Traditional dishes include breaded and fried clams, [[machaca]] and generally accompanied by flour tortillas. 

In a fishing village that was the subject of Siegelman, Haenn, and Basurto’s [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] research, jokes/lies, called ''mentiras'' (meaning jokes, lies, teases, etc. based on context), were used as a social tool to build group solidarity, distinguish between insiders and outsiders, and encourage exclusivity in resource extraction. This is a masculine practice, connected with [[machismo]], that is person- and context-specific. Three general categories of these jokes/lies were identified: jokes between men, exaggerations about fishing accomplishments, and profit-oriented deceptions during fish sales. The jokes between men are bragging stories and half-jokes used for [[Boasting|self-aggrandizement]] and comic relief. Prolonged versions of these jokes can be used as a [[gullibility]] test, going on until the listener(s) catch on and the group starts to laugh. This behavior ultimately reinforces bonds between fishermen by manipulating boundaries of inclusion. Exaggerations about fishing accomplishments are lies rather than jokes and are used to maintain their reputations as successful fishermen. This is socially acceptable and even expected from peers. Profit-oriented deceptions during fish sales involve tipping scales toward extra profit when [[Fishery|fisheries]] weigh their catch and understating the amount of gasoline or bait used to deflate the debt to their patrons in an effort to pad their earnings. Buyers are aware that contending with these lies is part of the process so they are often seen as harmless. One of the reasons for these jokes/lies is a commitment to harmony because they are methods to diffuse conflicts including those over fishing resources. Their ambiguity allows social interventions that go awry to be played off and their humor could be used to ease tensions.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Siegelman |first1=Ben |last2=Haenn |first2=Nora |last3=Basurto |first3=Xavier |date=November 2019 |title="Lies build trust": Social capital, masculinity, and community-based resource management in a Mexican fishery |journal=World Development |volume=123 |pages=104601 |doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.05.031 |issn=0305-750X|doi-access=free }}</ref>
