'''Burlington''' is a city and [[List of municipalities in Ontario#Lower-tier municipalities|lower-tier municipality]] in [[Regional Municipality of Halton|Halton Region]] at the west end of [[Lake Ontario]] in [[Ontario]], Canada. Located approximately halfway between Toronto and Niagara Falls, it is part of the [[Greater Toronto Area]] and the [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] [[Census geographic units of Canada|census metropolitan area]].

==History==
[[File:Brant Hotel - Burlington, Ontario (1902).jpg|thumb|left|The Brant Hotel in 1902. Located on the shore of Lake Ontario in Burlington, the hotel was erected on the former homestead of [[Joseph Brant]], and was the largest resort in Canada. The hotel was expropriated and used as a military hospital in 1917, demolished and rebuilt in the 1930s, and then demolished in 1964.<ref>{{cite web | title = Arts & Entertainment | publisher = Building Stories | url = http://www.buildingstories.co/bheritage/burlington/stories/arts/arts.pdf | access-date = February 18, 2015}}</ref>]]
Before the 19th century, the area between the provincial capital of York and the township of West Flamborough was home to the [[Mississaugas|Mississauga]] nation. In 1792, [[John Graves Simcoe]], the first [[lieutenant governor of Upper Canada]], named the western end of Lake Ontario "[[Burlington Bay]]" after the town of [[Bridlington]] in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], England.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Rayburn  | first = Alan   | title = Place Names of Ontario  | publisher = University of Toronto Press  | year = 1997  | location = Toronto-Buffalo-London  | page = 48  | isbn = 0-8020-7207-0}}</ref>

The British purchased the land on which Burlington now stands from the Mississaugas in Upper Canada Treaties 3 (1792), 8 (1797), 14 (1806), and 19 (1818). Treaty 8 concerned the purchase of the Brant Tract, {{convert|3450|acres|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} on Burlington Bay which the British granted to [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] chief [[Joseph Brant]] for his service in the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref name=ontariotreaties>{{cite web |url=https://www.ontario.ca/page/map-ontario-treaties-and-reserves |title=Map of Ontario treaties and reserves |publisher=Government of Ontario |date=February 22, 2021 |access-date=June 9, 2021}}</ref><ref name=branttract>{{cite web |last=Duric |first=Donna |url=http://mncfn.ca/treaty8/ |title=The Brant Tract Treaty, No. 8 (1797) |publisher=[[Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation]] |date=May 28, 2017 |access-date=June 9, 2021}}</ref> Joseph Brant and his household settled on this tract of land around 1802.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/thayendanegea_5E.html|title=Joseph Brant; The Dictionary of Canadian Biography|accessdate=September 15, 2021}}</ref> Brant is accordingly often referred to as the founder of Burlington, and the city of Burlington still celebrates an annual Joseph Brant Day in early August.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/burlington|title=Burlington; The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=September 15, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theheartofontario.com/event/joseph-brant-day-festival-a-celebration-of-burlington/|title=Joseph Brant Day; Hamilton-Halton-Brant Tourism|accessdate=September 15, 2021|archive-date=15 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210915213642/https://theheartofontario.com/event/joseph-brant-day-festival-a-celebration-of-burlington/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Subsequent disputes between the [[Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation]] and the Canadian government over payment for the Brant Tract and the [[Toronto Purchase]] were settled in 2010 for the sum of $145 million ([[Canadian dollar|CAD]]).<ref name=branttract/><ref>{{cite news |publisher=[[CTV News]] |url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/ontario-band-approves-145m-land-claim-settlement-1.520514 |title=Ontario band approves $145M land claim settlement |date=June 8, 2010 |access-date=June 9, 2021}}</ref>

By the turn of the 19th century, the name "Burlington" was already in common use. With the completion of the local survey after the War of 1812, the land was opened for settlement. Early farmers prospered in the Burlington area because the area had fertile soil and moderate temperatures. Produce from the farms was shipped out via the bustling docks of the lakeside villages of Port Nelson and Wellington Square, as well as Brown's Wharf in the nearby village of Port Flamborough (which was to become [[Aldershot, Ontario|Aldershot]]). Lumber taken from the surrounding forests also competed for space on the busy docks. In the latter half of the 19th century, increased wheat production from Western Canada convinced local farmers to switch to fruit and vegetable production.

In 1873, the villages of Wellington Square and&nbsp;Port Nelson&nbsp;merged to become the&nbsp;Village&nbsp;of Burlington which then became the&nbsp;Town of Burlington&nbsp;in 1914.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.burlington.ca/en/arts-culture-and-events/history-and-heritage.aspx|title=History and Heritage; The City of Burlington|accessdate=Aug 12, 2022}}</ref> The arrival of large steamships on the Great Lakes made the small docks of the local ports obsolete, and the increased use of railway to ship goods marked the end of the commercial wharves.

Farming still thrived though, and the resultant growth resulted in continued prosperity. By 1906, the town boasted its own newspaper—the ''Burlington Gazette''—as well as a town library and a local rail line that connected Burlington to nearby [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]. During the [[First World War]], 300 local men volunteered for duty in the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]]—38 did not return. In 1914, Burlington was incorporated into a town.

As more settlers arrived and cleared the land, cash crops replaced subsistence farming. Gradually, [[mixed farming]] and [[market garden]]s became the dominant form of agriculture, and in the early 20th century the area was declared the ''Garden of Canada''. The first [[peach]]es grown in Canada were cultivated in the Grindstone Creek watershed in the city's south-west part. The farming tradition has passed down through the generations. Today over 40 per cent of the Grindstone Creek watershed is still devoted to farms, [[orchards]] and [[Plant nursery|nurseries]].<ref>{{cite book |title = Halton: Rising, Wild and Beckoning | publisher = Conservation Halton | date = 1998}}</ref>

Following the [[Second World War]], cheap electricity from nearby Niagara Falls and better transportation access due to the new (1939) [[Queen Elizabeth Way]] encouraged both light industry and families to move to Burlington. The population skyrocketed as new homes were built, encouraging developers to build even more new homes. On 1 January 1958, Burlington officially annexed most of the Township of Nelson, as well as Aldershot, formerly a part of East Flamborough Township. By 1967, the last cash crop farm within the city had been replaced by the [[Burlington Centre]].<ref>{{cite web  | last = Reynolds  | first = John Lawrence  | title = Sounds by the Shore: A History of Burlington, Ontario, Canada  | publisher = City of Burlington  | date = June 1993  | url = http://cms.burlington.ca/AssetFactory.aspx?did=3750  | access-date = 2008-12-07  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023507/http://cms.burlington.ca/AssetFactory.aspx?did=3750  | archive-date = 4 March 2016  | url-status = dead  | df = dmy-all  }}</ref>

Burlington was the site of the Brant Inn built by the lake in 1917, which became famous during the ’40s and ’50s for showing big-band performers.

By 1974, with a population exceeding 100,000, Burlington was incorporated as a city. The extremely high rate of growth continued, and between 2001 and 2006, the population of Burlington grew by 9%, compared to Canada's overall growth rate of 5.4%. By 2006, the population topped 160,000.

==Geography==

Burlington is at the southwestern end of [[Lake Ontario]], just to the north east of [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] and the [[Niagara Peninsula]], roughly in the geographic centre of the urban corridor known as the [[Golden Horseshoe]]. Burlington has a land area of {{convert|187|km2|abbr=on}}. The main urban area is south of the Parkway Belt and [[Ontario Highway 407|Highway 407]]. The land north of this, and north Aldershot is used primarily for agriculture, rural residential and conservation purposes. The [[Niagara Escarpment]], Lake Ontario and the sloping plain between the escarpment and the lake make up the land area of Burlington. The city is no longer a port; sailing vessels in the area are used for recreational purposes and moor at a 215 slip marina in LaSalle Park.{{wide image|NewBurlingtonPan.jpg|1000px|alt=Burlington at night|Burlington at night}}

===Climate===
Burlington's climate is [[humid continental]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfa'') with hot, humid summers and cold and snowy winters. The climate is moderated somewhat by its proximity to [[Lake Ontario]]. Monthly mean temperatures range from {{convert|22.5|C}} in July to {{convert|−4.4|C}} in January. The average annual precipitation is {{convert|763|mm|abbr=on}} of rain and {{convert|99|cm|abbr=on}} of snow.

Although it shares the continental climate found in Southern Ontario, its proximity to the lake moderates winter temperatures and it also benefits from a sheltering effect of the [[Niagara Escarpment]], allowing the most northerly tracts of [[Carolinian forest]] to thrive on the Escarpment that runs through western sections of city. Several species of flora and fauna usually found only in more southern climes are present in Burlington, including paw-paw (''[[Asimina triloba]]''), green dragon (''[[Arisaema dracontium]]''), tuckahoe (''[[Peltandra virginica]]''), American columbo (''[[Frasera caroliniensis]]''), wall-rue (''[[Asplenium ruta-muraria]]''), plus the [[Louisiana waterthrush]], [[hooded warbler]], [[southern flying squirrel]] and rare [[Tricolored bat|eastern pipistrelle bat]]. Near the visible promontory of [[Mount Nemo Conservation Area|Mount Nemo]] that rises some 200&nbsp;m (650&nbsp;ft) above the lake level, a "vertical forest" of [[Thuja occidentalis|white cedar]] clinging to the Escarpment face includes many small trees that are more than one thousand years old.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Niagara Escarpment Commission: Flora & Fauna  | publisher = Niagara Escarpment Commission  | url = http://www.escarpment.org/about/ecology/flora/index_pf.php  | access-date = 2009-03-21  | url-status = dead  | archive-url = https://archive.today/20120730193927/http://www.escarpment.org/about/ecology/flora/index_pf.php  | archive-date = 30 July 2012  | df = dmy-all  }}</ref>

[[Hamilton Harbour]], the western end of Lake Ontario, is bounded on its western shore by a large sandbar, now called the Beach strip, that was deposited during the last [[ice age]]. A canal bisecting the sandbar allows ships access to the harbour. The [[Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway]] (part of the [[Queen Elizabeth Way]]), and the [[Burlington Canal Lift Bridge|Canal Lift Bridge]] allow access over the canal.
