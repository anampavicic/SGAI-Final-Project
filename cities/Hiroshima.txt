The Hiroshima metropolitan area is the second largest urban area in the [[Chugoku Region]] of Japan, following the [[Okayama]] metropolitan area.

Hiroshima was founded in 1589 as a [[Jōkamachi|castle town]] on the [[Ōta River]] [[river delta|delta]]. Following the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, Hiroshima rapidly transformed into a major urban center and industrial hub. In 1889, Hiroshima officially gained city status. The city was a center of military activities during the [[Empire of Japan|imperial era]], playing significant roles such as in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], the [[Russo-Japanese War]], and the two world wars.

Hiroshima was the first military target of a nuclear weapon in history. This occurred on August 6, 1945, in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre]] of [[World War II]], at 8:15&nbsp;a.m., when the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped the atomic bomb]] "[[Little Boy]]" on the city.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hakim |first=Joy|author-link1=Joy Hakim |title=A History of US: Book 9: War, Peace, and All that Jazz |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=January 5, 1995 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=978-0195095142|title-link=A History of US}}</ref> Most of Hiroshima was destroyed, and by the end of the year between 90,000 and 166,000 had died as a result of the blast and its effects. The [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial]] (a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]]) serves as a memorial of the bombing.

Since being rebuilt after the war, Hiroshima has become the largest [[Cities of Japan|city]] in the [[Chūgoku region]] of western [[Honshu]].

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Hiroshima}}

=== Early history ===
The region where Hiroshima stands today was originally a small fishing village along the shores of Hiroshima Bay. From the 12th century, the village was rather prosperous and was economically attached to a [[Zen|Zen Buddhist]] temple called ''[[Mitaki-Ji]]''. This new prosperity was partly caused by the increase of trade with the rest of Japan under the auspices of the [[Taira clan]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania |publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers |year=1996 |isbn=1-884964-04-4 |editor-last=Schellinger |editor-first=Paul |location=Chicago |pages=349 |editor-last2=Salkin |editor-first2=Robert}}</ref>

===Meiji and Showa periods (1871–1939)===
After the [[Han system|Han]] was abolished in 1871, the city became the capital of [[Hiroshima Prefecture]]. Hiroshima became a major urban center during the [[Empire of Japan|imperial period]], as the Japanese economy shifted from primarily rural to urban industries. During the 1870s, one of the seven government-sponsored English language schools was established in Hiroshima.<ref>Bingham (US Legation in Tokyo) to Fish (US Department of State), September 20, 1876, in ''Papers relating to the foreign relations of the United States, transmitted to congress, with the annual message of the president, December 4, 1876'', p. 384</ref> Ujina Harbor was constructed through the efforts of Hiroshima Governor [[Sadaaki Senda]] in the 1880s, allowing Hiroshima to become an important port city.

The [[San'yō Railway]] was extended to Hiroshima in 1894, and a rail line from the main station to the harbor was constructed for military transportation during the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].<ref name="Kosakai"/> During that war, the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] moved temporarily to Hiroshima, and [[Emperor Meiji]] maintained his headquarters at [[Hiroshima Castle]] from September 15, 1894, to April 27, 1895.<ref name="Kosakai">Kosakai, ''Hiroshima Peace Reader''</ref> The significance of Hiroshima for the Japanese government can be discerned from the fact that the first round of talks between Chinese and Japanese representatives to end the Sino-Japanese War was held in Hiroshima, from February 1 to 4, 1895.<ref>Dun (US Legation in Tokyo) to Gresham, February 4, 1895, in ''Foreign relations of United States, 1894'', Appendix I, p. 97</ref> New industrial plants, including [[cotton mill]]s, were established in Hiroshima in the late 19th century.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Origin of Modern Capitalism and Eastern Asia |author=Jacobs, Norman |publisher=Hong Kong University |year=1958 |page=51}}</ref> Further industrialization in Hiroshima was stimulated during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1904, which required development and production of military supplies.

During [[World War II]], the [[Second General Army (Japan)|Second General Army]] and Chūgoku Regional Army was headquartered in Hiroshima, and the Army Marine Headquarters was located at Ujina port.

The public release of film footage of the city following the attack, and some of the [[Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission]] research on the human effects of the attack, were restricted during the [[occupation of Japan]], and much of this information was censored until the signing of the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] in 1951, restoring control to the Japanese.<ref>Ishikawa and Swain (1981), p. 5</ref>

As [[Ian Buruma]] observed: {{blockquote|News of the amazing explosion of the atom bomb attacks on Japan was deliberately withheld from the Japanese public by US military censors during the Allied occupation—even as they sought to teach the natives the virtues of a free press. Casualty statistics were suppressed. Film shot by Japanese cameramen in Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the bombings was confiscated. "Hiroshima", the account written by John Hersey for ''The New Yorker'', had a huge impact in the US, but was banned in Japan.

From 1945 to 1952, Hiroshima came under [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force|occupation from the British Empire]].

Hiroshima was rebuilt after the war, with help from the national government through the Hiroshima Peace Memorial City Construction Law passed in 1949. It provided financial assistance for reconstruction, along with land donated that was previously owned by the national government and used by the Imperial military.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.city.hiroshima.jp/kikaku/joho/toukei/History-E/c05.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080206124545/http://www.city.hiroshima.jp/kikaku/joho/toukei/History-E/c05.html |archive-date=February 6, 2008 |title=Peace Memorial City, Hiroshima |publisher=Hiroshima Peace Culture Foundation |access-date=August 14, 2007}}</ref>

In 1949, a design was selected for the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park]].

Hiroshima was proclaimed a City of Peace by the Japanese parliament in 1949, at the initiative of its mayor, [[Shinzo Hamai]] (1905–1968).{{citation needed|date=January 2024}} As a result, the city of Hiroshima received more international attention as a desirable location for holding international conferences on peace as well as social issues.{{citation needed|date=January 2024}} As part of that effort, the Hiroshima Interpreters' and Guide's Association (HIGA) was established in 1992 to facilitate interpretation for conferences, and the Hiroshima Peace Institute was established in 1998 within the [[Hiroshima University]].

Streetcars and light rail vehicles are still rolling down Hiroshima's streets, including streetcars 651 and 652, which survived the atomic blast and are among the older streetcars in the system. When Kyoto and Fukuoka discontinued their trolley systems, Hiroshima bought them up at discounted prices, and, by 2011, the city had 298 streetcars, more than any other city in Japan.<ref name="hiroshimapeacemedia.jp"/>

===Cuisine===
[[File:Preparing okonomiyaki in Hiroshima.jpg|thumb|left|A man making an [[okonomiyaki]] at a restaurant in Hiroshima]]
Hiroshima is known for [[okonomiyaki]], a savory ([[umami]]) pancake cooked on an iron plate, usually in front of the customer. It is cooked with various ingredients, which are layered rather than mixed as done with the [[Osaka]] version of okonomiyaki. The layers are typically egg, cabbage, [[bean sprout]]s (moyashi), sliced pork/bacon with optional items (mayonnaise, fried squid, octopus, cheese, [[mochi]], [[kimchi]], etc.), and noodles ([[soba]], [[udon]]) topped with another layer of egg and a generous dollop of okonomiyaki sauce (Carp and Otafuku are two popular brands). The amount of cabbage used is usually 3 to 4 times the amount used in the Osaka style. It starts piled very high and is generally pushed down as the cabbage cooks. The order of the layers may vary slightly depending on the chef's style and preference, and ingredients will vary depending on the preference of the customer.
