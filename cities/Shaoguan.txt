'''Shaoguan''' is a [[prefecture-level city]] in northern [[Guangdong]] Province ([[Northern Guangdong|Yuebei]]), [[South China]], bordering [[Hunan]] to the northwest and [[Jiangxi]] to the northeast. It is home to the mummified remains of the sixth [[Zen]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] patriarch [[Huineng]]. Its built-up (or metro) area made up of Zhenjiang, Wujiang and Qujiang urban conurbated districts was home to 1,028,460 inhabitants as of the [[2020 Chinese census|2020 census]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.citypopulation.de/php/china-guangdong-admin.php |title=Search result of CHINA: Guăngdōng at citypopulation website}}</ref>

==History==
'''Shaozhou''' or '''Seochew''' was a prefecture under the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song]].

In 1589, [[Matteo Ricci]] relocated his mission house{{spaced ndash}}the first ever [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit mission]] in mainland China{{spaced ndash}}to Shaoguan after a fallout with the authorities in [[Zhaoqing]]. He remained in Shaoguan  for a few years, eventually benefiting from Shaoguan's location on the important north–south travel route to establish connections with traveling dignitaries that allowed him to move north, to [[Nanchang]], [[Nanjing]], and [[Beijing]].<ref>''[[De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas]]''</ref>

During [[World War II]] the city, then called Kukong, was the temporary capital of Guangdong Province.

In June 2009, [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]]s and [[Han Chinese|Han]] workers [[Shaoguan incident|clashed]] at a toy factory in Shaoguan ([[Shaoguan incident]]), which was followed by the [[July 2009 Ürümqi riots|Ürümqi riots]] in July.

==Geography==
[[File:湴田背村 - panoramio (2).jpg|thumb|left|Fields in Shaoguan]]
Shaoguan is the northernmost prefecture-level city of Guangdong, bordering [[Chenzhou]] ([[Hunan]]) to the northwest and north, [[Ganzhou]] ([[Jiangxi]]) to the northeast, [[Heyuan]] to the east, [[Guangzhou]] and [[Huizhou]] to the south, and [[Qingyuan]] to the west. It spans latitude 23° 53'−25° 31' N and longitude 112° 53'−114° 45' E.<ref>{{cite news|last1=the Yearbook of Shaoguan |first1= |title=Natural geography|url=https://www.sg.gov.cn/sq/sggk/zrdl/content/post_2304093.html | publisher=Shaoguan Government}}</ref> It is situated at the southern end of the [[Nan Mountains]] (Nan Ling), which primarily run east–west here, and is marked by numerous erosion-created valleys; within its borders lies the {{convert|1902|m|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[:zh:石坑崆|Mount Shikeng]] ({{lang|zh|石坑崆}}), the highest point in the province. The city is located on the [[Jingguang Railway]] (Beijing−Guangzhou) about {{convert|221|km}} north of the provincial capital of [[Guangzhou]]. Shaoguan is also readily accessible by road as it is adjacent to the [[G4 Beijing–Hong Kong and Macau Expressway]] as well as numerous other [[China National Highways|National Highways]].

At Shaoguan, the Wu River from the northwest and the Zhen River from the northeast join up to create the North River ([[Bei Jiang]]) which flows south to Guangzhou. The downtown part of Shaoguan is located on a peninsula between the Wu and Zhen Rivers. The rivers are maintained at a constant level by a dam about {{convert|12|km}} downstream from the city. The city has about {{convert|20|km}} of tree-lined riverside esplanades along the banks of the rivers.  There are seven bridges crossing the three rivers.

===Climate===
Shaoguan has a [[monsoon]]-influenced [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), with short, mild, damp winters, rainy springs, long, hot, and humid summers, and relatively sunny autumns. Due to the city's location far inland, winters are significantly cooler than in the rest of the province, with freezing rain possible in the nearby mountain passes in some years. Winter begins dry and relatively sunny but becomes progressively cloudier and damper. Spring is the cloudiest and wettest season, with the sun shining less than 30% of the time. The annual rainfall is around {{convert|1600|mm|in|abbr=on}}, much of it delivered from April thru June. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from {{convert|10.3|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|29.0|°C|1}} in July; the annual mean is {{convert|20.5|°C|1}}. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 16% in March to 54% in July, the city receives 1,617 hours of bright sunshine annually.
