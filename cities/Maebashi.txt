March 27, 1989. [http://www.city.maebashi.gunma.jp/sisei/444/447/p001785.html "Declaration from the Municipal Council"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012123548/http://www.city.maebashi.gunma.jp/sisei/444/447/p001785.html |date=2014-10-12 }}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The Maebashi area was called ''Umayabashi'' ({{lang|ja|厩橋}}) during the [[Nara period]]. This name finds its origins in the fact that there was a bridge ({{transliteration|ja|hashi}}, {{lang|ja|橋}}) crossing the [[Tone River]] and not far from the bridge there was a small refreshment house with a stable ({{transliteration|ja|umaya}}, {{lang|ja|駅家}}), often used by people travelling on the [[Tōzan-dō]] (the road connecting the capital to the eastern regions of Japan). The spelling was officially changed into ''Maebashi'' ({{lang|ja|前橋}}) in 1649 during the [[Edo period]] when Maebashi became a [[jōkamachi|castle town]] and the center of [[Maebashi Domain]], a [[han system|feudal domain]] under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].<ref>[http://www.city.maebashi.gunma.jp/sisei/444/445/p001291.html ''Maebashi no Rekishi'' (History of Maebashi)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817070853/http://www.city.maebashi.gunma.jp/sisei/444/445/p001291.html |date=2018-08-17 }} (July 24, 2012)</ref>

==History==
The town of Maebashi was established within [[Higashigunma District, Gunma|Higashigunma District]], Gunma Prefecture on April 1, 1889, with the creation of the modern municipalities system after the [[Meiji Restoration]]. Maebashi was raised to city status on April 1, 1892. In 1901, it annexed a portion of Kamikawabuchi village from [[Seta District, Gunma|Seta District]].{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}

On August 5, 1945, approximately 64.2% of the urban core of the city was destroyed during [[World War II]] during [[Air raids on Japan|air raids]] which followed the dropping of propaganda leaflets warning of the impending attacks.<ref>{{Cite book |editor-last=Craven |editor-first=Wesley |editor2=Cate, James |title=The Pacific: Matterhorn to Nagasaki |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1953 |series=The Army Air Forces in World War II.

In 1951, a portion of Kaigaya Village from Seta District was merged into Maebashi. The city expanded further on April 1, 1954, by annexing the villages of Kamikawabuchi, Shimokawabuchi, Azuma, Minamitachibana, Kaigaya, Haga, Motosōja, and Sōja from Seta District, followed by a portion of Jōnan village in 1957. On April 1, 1960, a portion of Tamamura Town and another portion of Jōnan village were merged into Maebashi, which finally annexed the remainder of Jōnan village in 1967.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}

Maebashi hosted the [[1999 IAAF World Indoor Championships]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=7th IAAF World Indoor Championships |url=https://worldathletics.org/results/world-athletics-indoor-championships/1999/7th-iaaf-world-indoor-championships-6904046 |access-date=2024-08-13 |website=worldathletics.org |language=en}}</ref>

On April 1, 2001, Maebashi was designated a [[Special cities of Japan|special city (''tokureishi'')]] with increased local autonomy.

On December 5, 2004, the town of [[Ōgo, Gunma|Ōgo]], as well as the villages of [[Kasukawa, Gunma|Kasukawa]] and [[Miyagi, Gunma|Miyagi]] (all from Seta District), were merged into Maebashi. On May 5, 2009, the village of [[Fujimi, Gunma|Fujimi]] (Seta District) was merged into Maebashi. Seta District was dissolved as a result of this merger.<ref name="Plannedmerge">[http://www.kokudo.or.jp/new/cities/sub/kanto/10.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821060502/http://www.kokudo.or.jp/new/cities/sub/kanto/10.htm|date=August 21, 2006}}</ref>

Maebashi became a [[Core cities of Japan|core city (''Chūkakushi'')]] on April 1, 2009.<ref name="history">{{cite web |script-title=ja:前橋市の歴史／前橋市 |lang=ja |trans-title=History of Maebashi City |url=https://www.city.maebashi.gunma.jp/gyosei/8/2/27742.html |access-date=12 June 2024 }}</ref>

==Geography==
Maebashi is located at the foot of [[Mount Akagi]] in the northeast corner of the [[Kantō Plain]]. It is also surrounded by [[Mount Haruna]] and [[Mount Myōgi]]. Two rivers run through the city: the [[Tone River]], Japan's second-longest, and the Hirose River. Although it is located inland more than 100 kilometers away from the coast, the elevation of the southern part of the city is only around 100 meters. The highest elevation is 1823 meters above sea level on the south side of Mt. Kurohino, a peak of [[Mount Akagi]]. Maebashi is the farthest from the sea (about 120&nbsp;km) of all Japanese prefectural capitals. The surrounding cities comprise an urban zone of over 1 million people, separated by farmland to the south from the built up areas of Greater Tokyo.

===Surrounding municipalities===
[[Gunma Prefecture]]
* [[Isesaki, Gunma|Isesaki]]
* [[Kiryū, Gunma|Kiryū]]
* [[Numata, Gunma|Numata]]
* [[Shibukawa, Gunma|Shibukawa]]
* [[Shintō, Gunma|Shintō]]
* [[Takasaki, Gunma|Takasaki]]
* [[Tamamura, Gunma|Tamamura]]
* [[Yoshioka, Gunma|Yoshioka]]

===Climate===
Maebashi has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa''). In the winter, the [[karakkaze]], or "dry wind" blows through Maebashi from the north. This is due to the snow clouds coming from the Sea of Japan being blocked by the Echigo Mountain Range between Gunma and [[Niigata Prefecture]]s. Because of this, the city has a dry winter and is one of the sunniest places in Japan at over 2,210 hours of sunshine per year.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Monthly total of sunshine duration (h) |url=https://www.data.jma.go.jp/obd/stats/etrn/view/monthly_s3_en.php?block_no=47624&view=12 |access-date=2024-01-21 |website=[[Japan Meteorological Agency]]}}</ref> In the summer, it is hot since the location is inland, although less hot than coastal [[Tokyo#Climate|Tokyo]] on average. On July 24, 2001, Maebashi hit {{convert|40|C|F}}, the fifth-hottest temperature ever in Japan.
