The area, along with [[San Diego]], was inhabited by the [[Kumeyaay]] before contact from the Spanish, who later claimed the area. In 1821, Chula Vista became part of the newly declared [[First Mexican Empire|Mexican Empire]], which reformed as the [[First Mexican Republic]] two years later. California became part of the United States in 1848 as a result of the [[Mexican–American War]], and was admitted to the union as a state in 1850.

Founded in the early 19th century and incorporated in October 1911, fast population growth has recently been observed in the city.

In 3000 BCE, people speaking the [[Quechan language|Yuman (Quechan) language]] began moving into the region from the [[Lower Colorado River Valley]] and southwestern [[Arizona]] portions of the [[Sonoran Desert]]. Later the [[Kumeyaay]] tribe came to populate the land, on which the city sits today, and lived in the area for hundreds of years.<ref name="CVH" /> The Kumeyaay built a village known as ''Chiap'' (or ''Chyap)'' which was located by mudflats at the southern end of South Bay.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carrico |first1=Richard L. |date=Spring 2017 |title=Castigating the Insolent Ones: Native Resistance and the Spanish Military the Pa'mu Incident |url=https://sandiegohistory.org/journal/2018/july/castigating-the-insolent-ones-native-resistance-and-the-spanish-military-the-pamu-incident/ |journal=The Journal of San Diego History |volume=63 |issue=3 & 4 |pages= |doi= |access-date=September 8, 2024}}</ref>

In 1542 CE, a fleet of three [[Spanish Empire]] ships commanded by [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo]], sailed into [[San Diego Harbor]]. Early explorations by Spanish [[conquistador]]s, such as these, led to Spanish claims of the land. The village of Chiap (known to the Spanish as La Punta) became a center of a [[Kumeyaay]] revolt against the Spanish in 1775, which was later abandoned by 1776.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Carrico|first=Richard|title=Kumeyaay History|url=https://www.kumeyaay.com/sociopolitical-aspects-of-the-1775-revolt-at-mission-san-diego-de-alcala.html|access-date=July 25, 2020|website=www.kumeyaay.com|language=en-gb}}</ref> The historic land on which Chula Vista sits became part of the 1795 land grant known as Rancho del Rey or The King's Ranch.

Argüello]] respectively.<ref name="USD2004Otay" />

During the [[Mexican–American War]], California was claimed by the United States, regardless of the [[California Republic|California independence]] movement that had briefly swept the state.

Beginning in the late 1980s the [[planned communities]] of Eastlake, Otay Ranch, Millenia, and Rancho del Rey began to develop in the annexed areas east of [[Interstate 805]] and [[California State Route 125]].  These communities expanded upon the eastern annexations of the 1970s, including the area around [[Southwestern College (California)|Southwestern College]].<ref name="Perspective"/> In 1986, Eastlake began to be built.<ref name=USD2004Otay>{{cite web |url=http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/local/otay.html |title=Otay Valley |last=Schoenherr |first=Steven |date=October 29, 2004 |website=San Diego Local History |publisher=University of San Diego |access-date=May 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509095054/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/local/otay.html |archive-date=May 9, 2008 }}</ref> In 1989, Rancho del Rey was established.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chulavistaca.gov/departments/public-works/operations/open-space/rancho-del-rey |title=Rancho Del Rey |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Open Space |publisher=City of Chula Vista |access-date=May 12, 2018 }}</ref> In 1999, Otay Ranch began to be built on {{convert|23000|acres|km2}}.<ref>{{cite news |last=Reed |first=Candice |date=November 25, 2006 |title=Otay Ranch's victory Lap |url=http://www.sddt.com/News/article.cfm?sourcecode=20061122tbf#.WvcneqQvyM8 |work= San Diego Daily Transcript |access-date=May 12, 2018 }}</ref>

Although "Eastlake" properly refers only to one planned community in east Chula Vista built around an artificial pond, the name is often used to encompass a much broader suburban region along the SR 125 corridor.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Salaam |first=Elizabeth |date=July 31, 2013 |title=What am I doing in Eastlake? |url=https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2013/jul/31/cover-what-am-i-doing-eastlake/ |magazine=San Diego Reader |location= |publisher= |access-date=September 8, 2024}}</ref> This is in part due to the misconception that the lake which the name "Eastlake" refers to is the much larger [[Lower Otay Reservoir]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2024}} Many businesses and institutions throughout east Chula Vista use "Eastlake" in their names.{{Citation needed|date=September 2024}}

In the years around 2008 thousands of [[Tijuana]]'s elite bought houses in and moved to east Chula Vista escaping violence, kidnapping and other crime taking place during that period in the Mexican metropolis only a few miles away.

===Climate===
Like the rest of lowland [[San Diego County]], Chula Vista has a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|BSk]]), with [[mediterranean climate|mediterranean]] characteristics, though the winter rainfall is too low and erratic to qualify as an actual Mediterranean climate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sdcounty.ca.gov/ctn/d2eoct03_climate.html |title=Mediterranean Climate |work=County Television Network |publisher=County of San Diego |access-date=March 19, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218230152/http://www.sdcounty.ca.gov/ctn/d2eoct03_climate.html |archive-date=February 18, 2011 }}</ref>
