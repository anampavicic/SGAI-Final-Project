== Danli Prison ==
According to the documentary presented by [[Paul Connolly (journalist)|Paul Connolly]], as opening episode of the series [[Inside the World's Toughest Prisons]], Danli prison already hosted more than twice the inmates it was intended to hold in 2016. The notorious ''Centro Penal de Danlí'' even allows its inmates to enforce their own rules.<ref>Walker, Daniel, [https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/uk-journalist-braves-worlds-most-7115717 UK journalist braves World's Most Dangerous Prison having to 'play by inmates rules'] Mirror.co.uk 1/4/2016</ref>
Prisons in Honduras are in general desperately overcrowded – in September 2019 reports disclosed that they operated at 204% of their capacity. Besides that more than half of the detainees are still waiting for their court hearing. Besides that [[Law enforcement]] in [[Honduras]] is underfinanced to an extent that escapes, drug abuse and corruption are common and even riots and target killings often cannot be prevented, as [[InSight Crime]] accounts.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Honduras, Prisons|date=15 February 2021|url=https://insightcrime.org/honduras-organized-crime-news/honduras/#prisons}}</ref>

== Roman Catholic Suffragan Diocese ==
Since 2017, the city is the episcopal see of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Danlí]], a [[suffragan]] diocese in the [[ecclesiastical province]] of the [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tegucigalpa]].
