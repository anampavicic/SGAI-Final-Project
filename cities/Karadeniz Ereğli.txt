==History==
{{main|Heraclea Pontica}}
Karadeniz Ereğli was originally a Greek city in ancient times known as ''[[Heraclea Pontica]]'' after the Greek mythical hero [[Heracles]]. The Turkish name Karadeniz Ereğli or colloquially Karadeniz Ereğlisi means 'Ereğli at the Black Sea', which distinguishes it from other places called Ereğli such as [[Ereğli, Konya|Konya Ereğlisi]] and [[Marmara Ereğlisi]].

It was founded by a [[Megara|Megarian]] colony, which soon subjugated the native Mariandynians and extended its power over a considerable territory.  It was the birthplace of [[Heraclides Ponticus]].<ref>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Heraclea |volume=13 |page=308 |inline=1}}</ref> According to [[Greek mythology]], the cave guarded by the three-headed dog [[Cerberus]] is located near the town. For his final quest, Heracles is tasked with entering the cave and capturing Cerberus.

The prosperity of the city, rudely shaken by the [[Galatia]]ns and the [[Bithynia]]ns, was utterly destroyed in the [[Mithridatic Wars]]. Then, Heraclea Pontica was part of the (Eastern) Roman Empire for more than 1000 years.
The Turks ravaged the area after the [[Battle of Mantzikert]] in 1071. [[David Komnenos]], brother of the ruler of Trebizond [[Alexios I of Trebizond]], took Heraclea Pontica in 1205 and made it capital of his domain, called Paphlagonia; he lost it in 1214 to Theodore I Laskaris, who made it a major frontier bulwark. The Genoese had a colony there after 1261. When the Turks conquered Paphlagonia in 1360, the Genoese bought the city from the weakening Byzantine Empire. Heraclea developed as a trading centre of the Genoese, who settled there in large numbers. A ruined citadel on a height overlooking the town is a remnant of this period. The Italian name of the city was Pontarachia.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Genoese portolan nautical chart. The oldest original cartographic artifact in the Library of Congress. Second quarter of the 14th century.|url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Mediterranean_chart_fourteenth_century2.jpg}}</ref> The Genoese held the city until the Ottomans captured it after 1453.<ref>Kazhdan, Alexander P. - The [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] - Volume 2 (1991, Oxford University Press), entry "Herakleia Pontike"</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Encyclopedia Britannica - entry 'Ereğli'|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Eregli-Zonguldak-province-Turkey}}</ref>

In the late 19th and early 20th century, Karadeniz Ereğli was part of the [[Kastamonu Vilayet]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

==Facts==
Modern Ereğli is the home of [[Erdemir]], an important steel plant of Turkey.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.erdemir.com.tr/corporate/contact-us/|title=Erdemir - Contact Us|website=www.erdemir.com.tr|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> It has a large natural harbour, located in the lee of Baba Burnu and therefore one of the few geographically attractive places for a harbour on the western [[Black Sea]] coast of [[Turkey]]. Ereğli is well developed due to the presence of the steel plant and fishing is a major commercial activity in the city.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}   Because of its Black Sea beach, Ereğli is a popular tourist destination locally.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}} The city does not have an airport (Erdemir has a small private field) or rail station, but can be reached by automobile or bus from [[Ankara]], [[Istanbul]] and other places.

In addition to its fishing and steel, Ereğli is also well known for its delicious [[Ottoman strawberry]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}
