=== Manama and Masfout ===
As well as the city of Ajman, the emirate encompasses two landlocked exclaves, [[Manama, Ajman|Manama]] and [[Masfut|Masfout]]. Manama is located 73 kilometers to the capital's east, covering an area of 26&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Manama is in the plains at the foothills of the Hajjar Mountains some 60&nbsp;km east of Ajman city. It also consists of a little, primarily agricultural oasis containing quarries and mines of magnesium and chromium. While Masfout is in the mountains proper, some 110&nbsp;km southeast of Ajman City. It consists of a small town that provides essential services and valleys sustained by subsistence farming and marble quarrying.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":6" /><ref name=":7" /><ref name=":8">{{Cite book|last1=Cadène|first1=Philippe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fSSzAQAAQBAJ&q=Manama+and+Masfout,+both+of+which+are+primarily+agricultural.&pg=PA68|title=Atlas of the Gulf States|last2=Dumortier|first2=Brigitte|date=2013-04-15|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-24566-2|language=en|access-date=20 October 2021|archive-date=20 February 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230220102253/https://books.google.com/books?id=fSSzAQAAQBAJ&q=Manama+and+Masfout,+both+of+which+are+primarily+agricultural.&pg=PA68|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Red Fort was built during Sheikh Humaid bin Abdul Aziz Al Nuaimi (1910–1928), and consists of four rooms in two towers. The fort was restored in 1986 and a third tower was added to the two older towers. Gravel and red plaster were used in the construction of the walls of the fort and hence it was named the Red Fort. Sandalwood was used in the beams and supports for the construction of the roofs.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.ajmantourism.ae/en/Disc/Pages/The-Red-Fort.aspx|title = The Red Fort|access-date = 30 November 2014|website = Ajman Tourism|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141206043829/http://www.ajmantourism.ae/en/Disc/Pages/The-Red-Fort.aspx|archive-date = 6 December 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref><ref name=":25" /><ref name=":26" /><ref name=":27" />
