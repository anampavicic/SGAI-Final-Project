==History==
The current town center was founded around 1860 by a group of [[Armenian people|Armenian]] merchants from [[Bitlis]] with the name Karakilise ({{lang|ota|قره‌کلیسا}}, {{Literal translation|the black church}}) that became known to the local population as Karakise, and this version was turned officially to Karaköse at the beginning of the Republican era. This name was changed to Ağrı by 1946.{{cn |date=September 2023}}

In the years of 1927 to 1931, the region was under the occupation of the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] separatist movements, which gained to establish an unrecognized state named [[Republic of Ararat]] which was led by several [[Kurds|Kurdish]] leaders, some of the Main were [[Ibrahim Heski]] and [[Ihsan Nuri]].{{cn |date=September 2023}}

In the medieval period, the district's administrative centre was located at [[Eleşkirt|Alashkert]], once an important town. The "kara kilise" or "black church" that gave the town its name was a medieval Armenian church. In 1895 [[H. F. B. Lynch]] stayed in Karakilise and wrote that it had between 1500 and 2000 inhabitants, was nearly two-thirds Armenian, and that a barracks for a locally recruited [[Hamidiye (cavalry)|Kurdish Hamidiye regiment]] had been recently located in the town.<ref>H. F. B. Lynch, "Armenia, Travels and Studies, volume 2, pages 3 - 9.</ref>

The Armenian population of the town and surrounding valley was massacred by tribal [[Kurds]] during the [[Armenian Genocide]]: a New York Times report from March 1915 talks of the Alashkert valley being covered with the bodies of men, women, and children.<ref>''Turks and Kurds Reported to have Massacred Men, Women, and Children'' [https://www.nytimes.com/1915/03/20/archives/whole-plain-strewn-by-armenian-bodies-turks-and-kurds-reported-to.html], New York Times, 20 March 1915.
