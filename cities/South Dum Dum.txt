[[File:Clive House, Rastraguru Ave, Nagerbazar.jpg|thumb|Clive House, Nagerbazar]]

'''Clive House''' on Rastraguru Avenue in [[Nagerbazar]] is mired in controversy. It is thought of as the first ''pucca'' brick and cement building in North Kolkata area and was possibly built by the Portuguese. Some say that it was the hunting lodge of an Indian prince or nobleman. What is known is that it was used by British soldiers when they first entered the country. Later, [[Robert Clive]] took the area over, renovated it, added a floor to the single-story building, and made it his country house around 1757-60. The house is located on raised ground in otherwise flat surroundings. When Clive House was excavated, a variety of artefacts were recovered, including coins, terracotta figures, sculptures, pottery and intelligence on a Portuguese fort. The articles found could be of the [[Sena dynasty|Sen period]], or may alternatively have links with the ancient civilization unearthed earlier at [[Chandraketugarh]]. Clive House has been in the domain of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] since 2004, but squatters inside and outside the structure have hindered restoration work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ordnancedumdum.gov.in/history/history.php|title=Ordnance Factory Dum Dum|work=Dum Dum Story|publisher=Indian Ordnance Factories|access-date=29 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://calcutta-kolkata-asim.blogspot.com/2011/11/heritage-of-kolkata-clive-house-under.html|title=Heritage of Kolkata – Clive House – under dilapidation|date=26 November 2011|publisher=Asim Kumar 2011|access-date=29 July 2018}}</ref><ref name="censushandbook">{{cite web|url=http://censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/DCHB_A/19/1911_PART_A_DCHB_NORTH%20TWENTY%20FOUR%20PARGANAS.pdf|title=District Census Handbook North Twenty Four Parganas, Census of India 2011, Series 20, Part XII A|work=Places of religious importance, Page 123|publisher=Directorate of Census Operations, West Bengal|access-date=29 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1030523/asp/calcutta/story_1991198.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030707124044/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1030523/asp/calcutta/story_1991198.asp|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 July 2003|title=Old house on the hill|publisher=The Telegraph, 23 May 2003|access-date=29 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1060124/asp/calcutta/story_5757213.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508202610/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060124/asp/calcutta/story_5757213.asp|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 May 2006|title=The two faces of Clive House in Dum Dum – Squatters inside or outside building still impeding Archaeulogical Survey's restoration project|publisher=The Telegraph, 24 January 2006|access-date=29 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Dum-Dum-mound-may-rewrite-Kolkata-history/articleshow/45244284.cms|title=Dum Dum mound may rewrite Kolkata history|newspaper=The Times of India |date=23 November 2014 |publisher=The Times of India, 23 November 2014|access-date=29 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://vivatheritage.co.uk/clive-of-indias-house-at-dum-dum-calcutta/|title=Clive of India's House at Dum Dum, Calcutta|publisher=Vivat Heritage, 2012|access-date=29 July 2018}}</ref>

With the [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|partition of Bengal]] in 1947, "millions of refugees poured in from erstwhile [[East Pakistan]]."<ref>Chatterjee, Monideep, "Town Planning in Calcutta: Past, Present and Future",  in "Calcutta, The Living City" Vol II, Edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Page 142, First published 1990, 2005 edition, {{ISBN|0-19-563697-X}}</ref> In the initial stages, the bulk of these refugees were non-agriculturists. A few of them made their own arrangements, but "it was squatters who made the [[East Bengali refugees]] famous or infamous." Squatting (''jabardakhal'' in Bengali) ranged from the forcible occupation of barracks to the collective take-over of private, government, and wasteland. By 1949, there were a total of 65 refugee colonies in the Dum Dum and Panihati zones. The squatters were in a way "self-settlers" in the absence of adequate official arrangements for rehabilitation. Within a very short time, the refugees (quite often with government/administrative support) not only found a place to stay but developed a society that included markets, schools, temples and sometimes even colleges, hospitals and recreational centres.<ref>Chatterjee, Nilanjana, "The East Bengal Refugees: A Lesson in Survival",  in "Calcutta, The Living City" Vol II, Edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Pages 72-75, First published 1990, 2005 edition, {{ISBN|0-19-563697-X}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271664458 |title =  The Myths Refugees Live By Memory and History of the Making of Bengali Refugee Identity |first=Uditi|last=Sen|journal = Modern Asian Studies|volume = 48 |pages = 37–76 | access-date = 5 March 2018|doi = 10.1017/S0026749X12000613 |year = 2014 |s2cid = 144297665 }}</ref>
