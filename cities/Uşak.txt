'''Uşak''' ({{IPA|tr|ˈuʃak}}) is a city in the interior part of the [[Aegean Region]] of [[Turkey]]. It is the seat of [[Uşak Province]] and [[Uşak District]].<ref name=ilce>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx İl Belediyesi], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory. Retrieved 22 May 2023.</ref> Its population is 236,366 (2022).<ref name=tuik>{{Cite web |title=Address-based population registration system (ADNKS) results dated 31 December 2022, Favorite Reports|url=https://biruni.tuik.gov.tr/medas/?kn=95&locale=en |access-date=22 May 2023|publisher=[[TÜİK]]|language=en|format=XLS}}</ref>

Uşak city is situated at a distance of {{convert|210|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from [[İzmir]], the region's principal metropolitan center and port city. Benefiting from its location at the crossroads of the [[Central Anatolia]]n plateau and the coastal [[Aegean Region]], and from a climate and agricultural production incorporating elements of both of these zones, Uşak has also traditionally had a strong industrial base. Uşak was the first city in Turkey to have an urban electricity network, and the first city where a collective [[labor relations]] agreement was signed, during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era, between [[leather]] industry employees and workers. It was here that the first factory of [[Republic of Turkey|Republican Turkey]], a [[sugar refinery]], was set up through a private sector initiative among local businessmen. The tradition of industriousness continues today around two [[industrial region|industrial zones]].

==History==
The first known organized states to have ruled over the region of present-day Uşak were the [[Phrygians]] in the eastern portion and the [[Lydians]] in the west during the seventh century BC.  The [[Karun Treasure]], discovered by clandestine [[treasure hunter]]s in Uşak in 1965, and whose smuggling outside Turkey and subsequent retrieval decades later from New York City's [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] made international headlines, gives an indication of the high degree of civilization attained by these [[Anatolia]]n states. The region of [[Lydia]] was later taken over by the [[Persian Empire]] in the 6th century BC and by [[Alexander the Great]] and his successors as of the 4th century.  Thereafter, Uşak was ruled successively by the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Seljuks]], the [[Germiyanids]] and finally the [[Ottoman Empire]] (as of 1429).

Later, following Turkish conquest and domination over the area, the city became known by its Turkish name of ''Uşak''; which means "servant." From 1867 until 1922, Uşak was part of [[Hüdavendigâr vilayet]].

Uşak was occupied by the [[Greek Army]] between 28 August 1920 and 1 September 1922. During the Greek retreat, Greek general [[Nikolaos Trikoupis]] was captured near Uşak at the village of Göğem, today buried under a [[dam reservoir]].

Uşak was a district center within [[Kütahya Province]] until 1953, when Uşak Province was constituted and Uşak became its provincial capital.

==Economic history==
At least since the 17th century there was trade between Uşak and the Dutch republic as reflected in the rug shown thrown over the bannister in Vermeer's painting "The Procuress." The rug was probably produced in Uşak, covers a third of the painting and shows [[medallion]]s and [[leaves]].<ref>Onno Ydema (1991) Carpets and their Datings in Netherlandish Paintings, 1540 - 1700, p. 43, 44, 145. {{ISBN|90-6011-710-7}}</ref> 
[[File:Jan Vermeer van Delft 002.jpg|thumb|The [[kelim]] rug shown in [[Jan Vermeer van Delft|Vermeer]]'s 1656 painting ''[[The Procuress (Vermeer)|The Procuress]]'' was identified as probably originating in Uşak,<ref>Onno Ydema (1991) Carpets and their Datings in Netherlandish Paintings, 1540 - 1700, p. 43, 44, 145. {{ISBN|90-6011-710-7}}</ref> testifying to 17th Century trade linking the city with the [[Dutch Republic]].]]

Among other district centers in Uşak Province, [[Banaz]] is the largest and is notable for its varied agricultural production as well as for its forests, while [[Ulubey, Uşak|Ulubey]]'s [[canyon]] is a natural site attracting many visitors.

==Geography==

==Uşak carpets==
[[File:18th Century Turkish Oushak Carpet.jpg|thumb|Strongly outlined palmettes and delicate botanical decorations adorn the central medallion of this exceptional Oushak.]]

{{Main|Ushak carpet}}
In pre-industrial times, Uşak was already a major center of production and export, particularly of [[Ushak carpets]]. Ushak carpets are also called [[Holbein carpets]] in reference to the 16th century painter [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] who depicted them in minute detail in his paintings, reflecting their popularity in European markets. The level of international popularity attained by Uşak's carpets became such that the word "Ushak" is considered an [[List of English words of Turkic origin|English word of Turkic origin]].<ref>[http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/unabridged?va=ushak Merriam-Webster Unabridged - Ushak] A heavy woolen oriental rug tied in Ghiordes knots and characterized by bright primary colors and an elaborate medallion pattern.</ref>

Although Uşak's carpet patterns have evolved since then, large-scale weaving still continues and the name of the city still has an important presence in the market for carpets, both hand-woven and industrial. On the other hand, the district of [[Eşme]], which is also in [[Uşak Province]], is famous for its ''[[kilim]]s''.
