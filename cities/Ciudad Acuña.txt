The 2015 population of Greater Del Rio-Ciudad Acuña binational metropolitan area is 280,000.

== History ==
The first recorded settlement of Acuña took place on 27 December 1877. It was founded by a group of colonists led by Domingo Urias, Irineo Casillas Arevalo, and his wife Maximina Espinoza. At the same time, the [[Governor of Coahuila|governor of the state]] was general [[Hipólito Charles]], who posted a military garrison in the area led by Captain Manuel Leal. In 1880, the community received ''villa'' (town)  status under its first name of Garza Galán. In 1884, the locality was renamed Congregación las Vacas. Congregacion las Vacas was then renamed Villa Acuña in 1912 after [[Saltillo, Coahuila|Saltillan]] poet [[Manuel Acuña]].  Villa Acuña was finally given the title of city on 16 September 1951 by Don JesusMaria Ramon, when it got its present name of Ciudad Acuña.

On 24 October 1960, [[US President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and [[Mexican President]] [[Adolfo López Mateos]] met in Acuña to sign the initial agreements allowing construction of the dam. Construction plans were not finalized until December 1966, when Presidents [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and [[Gustavo Díaz Ordaz]] met on the international bridge. Presidents [[Richard M. Nixon]] and [[Gustavo Díaz Ordaz]] met for the dedication of [[Amistad Dam]] on 8 September 1969.

Originally created to serve airmen at [[Laughlin AFB]] just across the border, "Boys' Town" is an entertainment district located in an area south of Ciudad Acuña and contains a few after-hours bars and [[brothels]], but is designated off-limits to U.S. military personnel.

On 25 May 2015, an [[F3 tornado]] [[2015 Texas–Oklahoma flood and tornado outbreak|struck the city]], causing incredible damage and killing 14 people and injuring 200 more.

== Economy ==
Various foreign companies have opened factories, or ''maquiladoras'' in Acuña, given its status as being 100% union-free. These include Irvin Automotive Products (automotive seat components), Howmet de Mexico (aerospace parts), Bendix (brake and hydraulic parts), Gentherm<ref>{{Cite web|title=Gentherm|url=https://gentherm.com/|url-status=live|website=gentherm.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040326071053/http://gentherm.com:80/ |archive-date=2004-03-26 }}</ref> de Mexico (automotive seat heaters), Caterpillar (mining truck components), RESCO Electronics (wiring harness and cable assembly manufacturing), and Toter Incorporated (waste receptacles, curbside roll-out carts). <!--needs to be updated  A future major project in the works coming to Cd.

==Education==
{{expand section|date=August 2015}}
Prior to 2009, many students living in this city used their relatives' addresses who lived in the U.S. to attend schools in the [[San Felipe Del Rio Consolidated Independent School District]], on the U.S. side. Minors were being interrogated at the border without an adult present, which caused much controversy, since that is illegal, and not all students had only one home. Many of their parents worked in the Del Rio side of the border and legally paid taxes. More than 400 students never came back.<ref>Cuevas-Nazario, Mayra.

==Media==
=== Radio ===
In the 1930s in Villa Acuña, now Ciudad Acuña, the [[border blaster]] [[XERF-AM]] made its home.  The radio station was built by [[John R. Brinkley]] from the U.S. state of Kansas. Brinkley claimed to be able to cure male virility deficiency with goat gland transplants. Brinkley wanted to promote his male enhancement operations and used the radio station for that purpose.  Because of the purpose of radio [[XER (Villa Acuña)|XER]] and what it promoted, the station was closed in 1939 by the Mexican government.

In 1947, the government of Mexico licensed XER, the 100&nbsp;kW super-power border blaster run by Ramon D. Bosquez.  They used the old XERA facilities and sold its airtime to American evangelists broadcasting in English to the [[United States]]. In 1959, Ramon D. Bosquez and Arturo Gonzalez formed the Inter-American Radio Advertising, Inc. in Del Rio. They ran the broadcasting in Del Rio while the license rested in the hands of Mexican officials. They boosted the power to 250&nbsp;kW. This super station was where disc jockey [[Wolfman Jack]] became famous between 1962 and 1964.  XERF-AM is currently under control of the [[Instituto Mexicano de la Radio]] and plays Spanish-language programs and music.
