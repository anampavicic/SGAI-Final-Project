The '''North-East District''' is one of the administrative [[districts of Botswana]]. Its capital is [[Francistown]]. In 2011, North-East had a population of 60,264 people.<ref name="census" /> The district is predominantly occupied by [[Kalanga language|Kalanga]]-speaking people, the [[BaKalanga]]. The district is administered by a district administration and district council, which are responsible for local administration.

In the north and east, the district borders the [[Matabeleland South Province]] of [[Zimbabwe]], and the border in the east is predominantly along the [[Ramokgwebana River]]. In the south and west, the district borders the [[Central District (Botswana)|Central District]] along the [[Shashe River]].

==Geography==
[[File:Francistown 27.51670E 21.16674S.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Aerial view of [[Francistown]]]]
Most parts of Botswana have tableland slopes sliding from east to west. It is predominantly [[savannah]], with tall grasses, bushes, and trees. The region has an average elevation of around {{convert|915|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. The annual precipitation is around {{convert|65|cm|in|abbr=on}}, most of which is received during the summer season from November to May. There are conflicts between [[agricultural expansion]] and the protection of indigenous [[wildlife]] within the Central District.

The district has several seasonal rivers that flow in the rainy season and reach the [[Makgadikgadi Pan]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=Jan |last1=Petter|first2= Huberth|last2= Hansen|first3= Arvid |last3=Lillethun|title=Resource utilization in the Central District CFDA, Botswana: with special reference to arable farming systems and conflicts in resource management - livestock versus wildlife}}</ref> [[Shashe River]], which is prone to [[flash flood]]s, is the most prominent.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fh6UUv1En9EC&q=botswana+geography&pg=SA12-PA53|title=Geography|last=Singh|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|year=2011|isbn=978-0-07-107480-3|page=12.53}}</ref> The [[Nata River]], which is a significant gathering place for birds and other wildlife, flows through the district and discharges into the Makgadikgadi Pan.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Elizabeth |last=Cashdan |year=1986|title=Competition between Foragers and Food-Producers on the Botletli River, Botswana|journal=Journal of the International African Institute|volume= 56|issue= 3| pages= 299–318|jstor=1160686 |doi=10.2307/1160686 }}

==District administration==
When Botswana gained independence from [[Scramble for Africa|British colonization]] in 1966, the country adapted the colonial administrative framework to form a district administration. Between 1970 and 1974, the policies were modified to address impediments to rural development.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Rural Development in Botswana: Administrative Structures and Public Policy|jstor=4190662|journal=The Journal of Developing Areas|first=Louis A. |last=Picard|volume=13|issue=3|pages=283–300|publisher=Louis A. Picard|year=1979}}</ref>

The district is administered by a district administration and district council, which are responsible for local administration. The policies for the administration are framed by the Ministry of Local Government. The council's primary activities are Tribal Administration, Remote Area Development, and Local Governance. The executive powers of the council are vested on a commissioner appointed by the central government. The Department of Local Government Technical Services is responsible for developing and maintaining infrastructure, including roads, village water supplies, schools, and recreational facilities.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Regional and Local government in Botswana |publisher=Common Wealth of Nations |url=http://www.commonwealthofnations.org/sectors-botswana/government/regional_local_government/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118032954/http://www.commonwealthofnations.org/sectors-botswana/government/regional_local_government/ |archive-date=18 January 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref> All local administration staff members, except the District Administrator, are selected via Unified Local Government Services. The Ministry of Local Government is responsible for their training, deployment, and career development.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kinuthia-Njenga |first=Cecilia |display-authors=etal |year=2002 |title=Local Democracy and Decentralization in East and Southern Africa: Experiences from Uganda, Kenya, Botswana, Tanzania, and Ethiopia |location=Nairobi, Kenya |publisher=Global Campaign on Urban Governance, United Nations Human Settlements Programme |page=57 |isbn=978-92-1-131666-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NOk51jEot_EC&pg=PA56}}</ref>
