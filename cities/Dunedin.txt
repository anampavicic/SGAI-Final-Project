The harbour and hills around Dunedin are the remnants of an extinct volcano. The city suburbs extend out into the surrounding valleys and hills, onto the isthmus of the [[Otago Peninsula]], and along the shores of the Otago Harbour and the Pacific Ocean.

Archaeological evidence points to lengthy occupation of the area by [[Māori people|Māori]] prior to the arrival of Europeans.

Dunedin's population and wealth boomed during the 1860s' [[Otago gold rush]], and for a brief period of time it became New Zealand's largest urban area. The city saw substantial migration from mainland China at the same time, predominately from [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Taonga |first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu |title=Chinese |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/chinese |access-date=2022-08-19 |website=teara.govt.nz |language=en}}</ref> Dunedin is home to New Zealand's oldest [[Chinese New Zealanders|Chinese community]].<ref name=":0" />

{{Main|History of the Dunedin urban area}}

=== Māori settlements ===
Archaeological evidence shows the first human (Māori) occupation of New Zealand occurred between 1250 and 1300 AD,<ref name=
"settled" /> with the population concentrated along the southeast coast.{{sfn|Hamel|2001}}{{sfn|Anderson|Allingham|Smith|1996}}{{sfn|Anderson|1998}} A camp site at Kaikai Beach, near [[Long Beach, New Zealand|Long Beach]] to the north of the present-day city of Dunedin, has been dated from about that time.{{sfn|Anderson|1983}} There are numerous archaic ([[moa]]-hunter) sites in what is now Dunedin, several of them large and permanently occupied, particularly in the 14th century.{{sfn|Hamel|2001}}{{sfn|Anderson|Allingham|Smith|1996}} The population contracted but expanded again with the evolution of the Classic [[Māori culture]] which saw the building of several [[Pā (Māori)|pā]], fortified settlements, notably Pukekura at ([[Taiaroa Head]]), about 1650.{{sfn|Anderson|1998}} There was a settlement in what is now central Dunedin (Ōtepoti), occupied as late as about 1785 but abandoned by 1826.<ref>Turton, Hanson "Introductory" in {{harvnb|Bathgate|1890}}</ref>{{sfn|Entwisle|2005}} There were also Māori settlements at [[Whareakeake]] (Murdering Beach), [[Pūrākaunui]], Mapoutahi (Goat Island Peninsula) and Huriawa ([[Karitane]] Peninsula) to the north, and at [[Taieri Mouth]] and Otokia ([[Henley, New Zealand|Henley]]) to the south, all inside the present boundaries of Dunedin.
[[File:Dunedin Museum 1 (31500865416).jpg|thumb|Dunedin Museum Māori artefact]]
[[Māori mythology|Māori tradition]] tells first of a people called Kahui Tipua living in the area, then Te Rapuwai, semi-legendary but considered{{by whom|date=June 2019}} to be historical. The next arrivals were [[Waitaha (South Island iwi)|Waitaha]],{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} followed by [[Kāti Māmoe]] late in the 16th century and then [[Kāi Tahu]] (''Ngāi Tahu'' in modern standard [[Māori language|Māori]]) who arrived in the mid-17th century.{{sfn|McLintock|1949}} European accounts have often represented these successive influxes as "invasions", but modern scholarship has cast doubt on that view. They were probably migrations – like those of the Europeans – which incidentally resulted in bloodshed.{{sfn|Anderson|1998}}{{sfn|Anderson|1983}}
The sealer [[John Boultbee (explorer)|John Boultbee]] recorded in the late 1820s that the 'Kaika Otargo' (settlements around and near [[Otago Harbour]]) were the oldest and largest in the south.{{sfn|Begg|Begg|1979}}

=== Early arrivals from Europe ===
[[File:Dunedin c. 1856 SLNSW FL10386954.jpg|thumb|Dunedin, New Zealand, c. 1856]]
Lieutenant [[James Cook]] stood off what is now the coast of Dunedin between 25 February 1770 and 5 March 1770, naming [[Cape Saunders]] (on the [[Otago Peninsula]]) and Saddle Hill. He reported penguins and seals in the vicinity, which led Australian, American and British [[Seal hunting|sealers]] to visit from the beginning of the 19th century.{{sfn|Beaglehole|1955–1967}} The early years of sealing saw a feud between sealers and local Māori from 1810 to 1823, the "[[Sealers' War]]" sparked by an incident on Otago Harbour. [[William Tucker (settler)|William Tucker]] became the first European to settle in the area – in 1815.{{sfn|Entwisle|2005}}

Permanent European occupation dates from 1831, when the [[Weller brothers]] of [[Colony of New South Wales|New South Wales]] founded their [[whaling station]] at Otago (present-day [[Otakou]]) on the Otago Harbour. Epidemics severely reduced the Māori population. By the late 1830s, the Harbour had become an international whaling port. Wright & Richards started a whaling station at [[Karitane]] in 1837 and Sydney-born [[Johnny Jones (pioneer)|Johnny Jones]] established a farming settlement and a [[mission station]] (the South Island's first) at [[Waikouaiti]] in 1840.{{sfn|Entwisle|1998}} The settlements at Karitane and Waikouaiti have endured, making modern Dunedin one of the longest-standing European-settled territories in New Zealand.

The name "Dunedin" comes from ''Dùn Èideann'', the [[Scottish Gaelic]] name for [[Edinburgh]], the capital of [[Scotland]].{{sfn|McLintock|1949}} [[Charles Kettle]] the city's surveyor, instructed to emulate the characteristics of Edinburgh, produced a striking, "Romantic" town-planning design.{{sfn|Hocken|1898}} There resulted both grand and quirky streets, as the builders struggled and sometimes failed to construct his bold vision across the challenging landscape. Captain [[William Cargill (New Zealand politician)|William Cargill]] (1784–1860), a veteran of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], served as the secular leader of the new colony. The Reverend [[Thomas Burns (minister, born 1796)|Thomas Burns]] (1796–1871), a nephew of the poet [[Robert Burns]], provided spiritual guidance. By the end of the 1850s, around 12,000 Scots had emigrated to Dunedin, many from the industrial [[Scottish Lowlands|lowlands]].<ref name="Campsie"/>

=== Gold rush era ===
In 1852, Dunedin became the capital of the [[Otago Province]], the whole of New Zealand from the [[Waitaki River|Waitaki]] south. In 1861, the discovery of gold at [[Gabriel's Gully]], to the south-west, led to a rapid influx of people and saw Dunedin become New Zealand's first city by growth of population in 1865. The new arrivals included many Irish, but also Italians, Lebanese, French, Germans, Jews and Chinese.{{sfn|McLintock|1949}}{{sfn|McDonald|1965}} The [[Dunedin Southern Cemetery]] was established in 1858, the [[Dunedin Northern Cemetery]] in 1872.<ref>{{cite web |last=Betteridge |first=Chris |title=Landscapes of Memory – breathing new life into old cemeteries |url=http://www.historic.org.nz/aboutus/OtagoBranch/gfx/Lawson%20Lecture%202004.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041123173155/http://www.historic.org.nz/aboutus/OtagoBranch/gfx/Lawson%20Lecture%202004.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=23 November 2004 |date=28 July 2004 |page=2 |work=NZ Historic Places Trust|access-date=14 May 2008 }}</ref> In the 1860s, [[Ross Creek Reservoir]] was created so as to serve Dunedin's need for water.

Dunedin and the region industrialised and consolidated, and the [[Main South Line]] connected the city with [[Christchurch]] in 1878 and Invercargill in 1879. Otago Boys' High School was founded in 1863. The [[Otago Museum]] opened in 1868. The [[University of Otago]], the oldest university in New Zealand, in 1869.{{sfn|Morrell|1969}} [[Otago Girls' High School]] was established in 1871.

Between 1881 and 1957, Dunedin was home to [[Dunedin cable tramway system|cable trams]], being both one of the first and last such systems in the world. Early in the 1880s the inauguration of the frozen meat industry, with the first shipment leaving from [[Port Chalmers]] in 1882, saw the beginning of a later great national industry.{{sfn|McLintock|1951}} The first successful commercial shipment of frozen meat from New Zealand to the United Kingdom was on [[Dunedin (ship)|the Dunedin]] in 1881.

After ten years of gold rushes the economy slowed but [[Julius Vogel]]'s immigration and development scheme brought thousands more, especially to Dunedin and Otago, before recession set in again in the 1880s. In these first and second times of prosperity, many institutions and businesses were established, New Zealand's first daily newspaper, [[art school]], [[medical school]] and [[public art]] gallery. The [[Dunedin Public Art Gallery]] was among these new foundations.{{sfn|McLintock|1949}}{{sfn|McDonald|1965}}{{sfn|Entwisle|1984}} It had been actively promulgated by artist [[W. M. Hodgkins|William Mathew Hodgkins]]'''.''' There was also a remarkable architectural flowering producing many substantial and ornamental buildings. [[Robert Lawson (architect)|R. A.

The other visual arts also flourished under the leadership of [[W. M.

Institutions such as the Otago Settlers Museum (now renamed as [[Toitū Otago Settlers Museum]]) and the [[Hocken Collections]]—the first of their kind in New Zealand—were founded. More notable buildings such as the [[Dunedin Railway Station|Railway Station]] and [[Olveston (house)|Olveston]] were erected. New energy in the visual arts represented by [[G. P.

By 1900, Dunedin was no longer the country's biggest city. Influence and activity moved north to the other centres ("the drift north"), a trend which continued for much of the following century. Despite this, the university continued to expand, and a student quarter became established. At the same time, people started to notice Dunedin's mellowing, the ageing of its grand old buildings, with writers like E. H. McCormick pointing out its atmospheric charm.{{sfn|McCormick|1959}} In 1901 the British royals, the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York toured Dunedin. 

In the 1930s and early 1940s a new generation of artists such as [[Toss Woollaston|M. T. (Toss) Woollaston]], [[Doris Lusk]], Anne Hamblett, [[Colin McCahon]] and [[Patrick Hayman]] once again represented the best of the country's talent. The Second World War saw the dispersal of these painters, but not before McCahon had met a very youthful poet, [[James K. Baxter]], in a central city studio.

Numerous large companies had been established in Dunedin, many of which became national leaders. Late among them was [[Fletcher Construction]], founded by Sir [[James Fletcher (industrialist)|James Fletcher]] in the early 20th century. [[Kempthorne Prosser]], established in 1879 in Stafford Street, was the largest fertiliser and drug manufacturer in the country for over 100 years. [[Methven (company)|G. Methven]], a metalworking and tap manufacturer based in [[South Dunedin]], was also a leading firm, as was [[Henry Ely Shacklock|H. E. Shacklock]], an iron founder and appliance manufacturer later taken over by the Auckland concern [[Fisher and Paykel]]. The [[Mosgiel Woollens]] was another Victorian Dunedin foundation. [[Hallensteins]] was the colloquial name of a menswear manufacturer and national retail chain, while the DIC and [[Arthur Barnett (department store)|Arthur Barnett]] were department stores, the former a nationwide concern. Coulls, Somerville Wilkie—later part of the [[Whitcoulls]] group—had its origins in Dunedin in the 19th century. There were also the [[National Mortgage and Agency Company of New Zealand]], [[Wright Stephenson|Wright Stephensons Limited]], the Union Steamship Company and the National Insurance Company and the Standard Insurance Company among many others, which survived into the 20th century.

=== Post-war developments ===

After the [[World War II|Second World War]] prosperity and population growth revived, although Dunedin trailed as the fourth 'main centre'. A generation reacting against [[Victorian architecture|Victorianism]] started demolishing its buildings and many were lost, notably [[William Mason (architect)|William Mason]]'s [[Stock exchange]] in 1969. ([[Princes Street, Dunedin|Dunedin Stock Exchange building]]) Although the university continued to expand, the city's population contracted, notably from 1976 to 1981.

During the 1980s Dunedin's [[popular music]] scene blossomed, with many acts, such as [[The Chills]], [[The Clean]], [[The Verlaines]] and [[Straitjacket Fits]], gaining national and international recognition. The term "The [[Dunedin sound]]" was coined to describe the 1960s-influenced, guitar-led music which flourished at the time.<ref>{{cite book |first=Roy |last=Shuker |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PRavFA8l2FQC&q=The+Dunedin+Sound%22+1960s+music&pg=PA210 |title=Understanding popular music |publisher=Routledge |date=2001 |isbn=9780415235099 |access-date=17 October 2020 |archive-date=18 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211018041452/https://books.google.com/books?id=PRavFA8l2FQC&q=The+Dunedin+Sound%22+1960s+music&pg=PA210 |url-status=live }}</ref> Bands and musicians are still playing and recording in many styles.

By 1990, [[population decline]] had steadied and slow growth has occurred since and Dunedin re-invented itself as a 'heritage city' with its main streets refurbished in the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian style]].<ref name="heritage buildings">[https://web.archive.org/web/20020131173317/http://www.cityofdunedin.com/city/?page=feat_heritagehousing Dunedin City council page]</ref> [[Robert Lawson (architect)|R. A. Lawson]]'s Municipal Chambers ([[Dunedin Town Hall]]) in [[the Octagon, Dunedin|the Octagon]] were handsomely restored. The city was also recognised as a centre of excellence in tertiary education and research. The university's and polytechnic's growth accelerated. Dunedin has continued to refurbish itself, embarking on redevelopments of the [[Art museum|art gallery]], railway station and the [[Toitū Otago Settlers Museum]]. Meanwhile, the continued blossoming of local creative writing saw the city gain UNESCO [[City of Literature]] status in 2014. 
[[File:28 High Street, Dunedin, New Zealand - Neuseeland.jpg|thumb|High Street Dunedin (2009)]]
Dunedin has flourishing niche industries including engineering, software engineering, [[biotechnology]] and fashion. [[Port Chalmers]] on the [[Otago Harbour]] provides Dunedin with deep-water facilities. It is served by the [[Port Chalmers Branch]], a [[branch line]] railway which diverges from the [[Main South Line]] and runs from [[Christchurch]] by way of Dunedin to [[Invercargill]]. Dunedin is also home to [[MTF Ltd|MTF]], the nationwide vehicle finance company.

The cityscape glitters with gems of Victorian and Edwardian architecture—the legacy of the city's gold-rush affluence. Many, including First Church, [[Otago Boys' High School]] and [[Larnach Castle]] were designed by one of New Zealand's most eminent architects [[Robert Lawson (architect)|R. A. Lawson]]. Other prominent buildings include [[Olveston (house)|Olveston]] and the [[Dunedin Railway Station]].

== Geography ==
[[File:Taiaroa Head 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Taiaroa Head]] with lighthouse.]]
The Dunedin City territorial authority has a land area of {{convert|3314.8|km2|abbr=on}}, slightly larger than the American state of [[Rhode Island]] or the English county of [[Cambridgeshire]], and a little smaller than [[Cornwall]]. It was the largest city in land area in New Zealand until the formation of the {{convert|5600|km2|abbr=on}} [[Auckland Council]] on 1 November 2010. The Dunedin City Council boundaries since 1989 have extended to [[Middlemarch, New Zealand|Middlemarch]] in the west, [[Waikouaiti]] in the north, the Pacific Ocean in the east and south-east, and the Waipori/Taieri River and the township of [[Henley, New Zealand|Henley]] in the south-west.

Dunedin is situated at the head of [[Otago Harbour]], a narrow inlet extending south-westward for some 15 miles. The harbour is a recent creation formed by the flooding of two river valleys.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dunedin City |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/dunedin-city |publisher=An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand|access-date=1 September 2016 |date=1966|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915042505/http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/dunedin-city|archive-date=15 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> From the time of its foundation in 1848, the city has spread slowly over the low-lying [[flat (landform)|flats]] and nearby hills and across the [[isthmus]] to the slopes of the [[Otago Peninsula]].

The central region of Dunedin is known as [[The Octagon, Dunedin|the Octagon]]. It was once a gully, filled in the mid-nineteenth century to create the present plaza. The initial settlement of the city took place to the south on the other side of [[Bell Hill, New Zealand|Bell Hill]], a large outcrop which had to be reduced to provide easy access between the two parts of the settlement. The central city stretches away from this point in a largely northeast–southwest direction, with the main streets of [[George Street, Dunedin|George Street]] and Princes Street meeting at The Octagon. Here they are joined by [[Stuart Street, Dunedin|Stuart Street]], which runs orthogonally to them, from the [[Dunedin Railway Station]] in the southeast, and steeply up to the suburb of [[Roslyn, Dunedin|Roslyn]] in the northwest. Many of the city's notable old buildings are located in the southern part of this area and on the inner ring of lower hills which surround the central city (most of these hills, such as [[Maori Hill]], Pine Hill, and [[Maryhill, New Zealand|Maryhill]], rise to some {{convert|200|m|disp=sqbr}} above the plain). The head of the harbour includes a large area of reclaimed land ("The Southern Endowment"), much of which is used for light industry and warehousing. A large area of flat land, simply known colloquially as "The Flat" lies to the south and southwest of the city centre, and includes several larger and older suburbs, notably [[South Dunedin]] and [[St Kilda, New Zealand|St Kilda]]. These are protected from the Pacific Ocean by a long line of dunes which run east–west along the city's southern coastline and separate residential areas from [[Ocean Beach, Otago|Ocean Beach]], which is traditionally divided into [[St. Clair Beach]] at the western end and [[Ocean Beach, Otago|St Kilda Beach]] to the east.

[[File:Baldwin Street High Resolution Upwards Look.jpg|thumb|[[Baldwin Street]] in North East Valley is the world's steepest residential street]]

Dunedin is home to [[Baldwin Street]], which, according to the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of Records]]'', is the steepest street in the world. Its gradient is 1 in 2.9.<ref>{{cite web |title=Steepest Streets in Dunedin |url=http://www.cityofdunedin.com/city/?page=roading_steep_street|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030526004153/http://www.cityofdunedin.com/city/?page=roading_steep_street|url-status=dead|archive-date=26 May 2003 |publisher=Dunedin City Council|access-date=16 May 2008}}</ref> The long-since-abandoned Maryhill [[Cable car (railway)|Cablecar]] route had a similar gradient close to its Mornington depot.

Beyond the inner range of hills lie Dunedin's outer suburbs, notably to the northwest, beyond Roslyn. This direction contains Taieri Road and Three Mile Hill, which between them formed the original road route to the [[Taieri Plains]]. The modern [[State Highway 1 (New Zealand)|State Highway 1]] follows a different route, passing through [[Caversham, New Zealand|Caversham]] in the west and out past Saddle Hill. Lying between Saddle Hill and Caversham are the outer suburbs of [[Green Island, New Zealand|Green Island and Abbotsford]]. Between Green Island and Roslyn lies the steep-sided valley of the [[Kaikorai Stream]], which is today a residential and light industrial area. Suburban settlements—mostly regarded as separate townships—also lie along both edges of the Otago Harbour. Notable among these are [[Portobello, New Zealand|Portobello]] and [[Macandrew Bay]], on the [[Otago Peninsula]] coast, and [[Port Chalmers]] on the opposite side of the harbour. Port Chalmers provides Dunedin's main deep-water port, including the city's container port.

The Dunedin skyline is dominated by a ring of (traditionally seven) hills which form the remnants of a [[volcanic crater]]. Notable among them are [[Mount Cargill]] ({{convert|700|m|disp=sqbr|abbr=on}}), [[Flagstaff, Otago|Flagstaff]] ({{convert|680|m|disp=sqbr|abbr=on}}), [[Saddle Hill, New Zealand|Saddle Hill]] ({{convert|480|m|disp=sqbr|abbr=on}}), [[Signal Hill, New Zealand|Signal Hill]] ({{convert|390|m|disp=sqbr|abbr=on}}), and [[Harbour Cone]] ({{convert|320|m|disp=sqbr|abbr=on}}).{{sfn|Dann|Peat|1989}}

===Hinterland===
[[File:Dunedin Otago Peninsula Harbour.jpg|thumb|right|Dunedin (grey area to lower left) sits close to the isthmus of the [[Otago Peninsula]], at the end of [[Otago Harbour]]]]
Dunedin's hinterland encompasses a variety of different landforms. To the southwest lie the [[Taieri Plains]], the broad, fertile lowland floodplains of the [[Taieri River]] and its major tributary, the [[Waipori River|Waipori]]. These are moderately heavily settled, and contain the towns of [[Mosgiel]], and [[Allanton, New Zealand|Allanton]].{{sfn|Dann|Peat|1989}} They are separated from the coast by a range of low hills rising to some {{convert|300|m}}. Inland from the Taieri Plain is rough hill country. Close to the plain, much of this is forested, notably around [[Berwick, New Zealand|Berwick]] and [[Lake Mahinerangi]], and also around the [[Silverpeaks]] Range which lies northwest of the Dunedin urban area.{{sfn|Bishop|Hamel|1993}} Beyond this, the land becomes drier and opens out into grass and [[tussock grass|tussock]]-covered land. A high, broad valley, the [[Strath-Taieri]] lies in Dunedin's far northwest, containing the town of [[Middlemarch, New Zealand|Middlemarch]], one of the area's few concentrations of population.

To the north of the city's urban area is undulating hill country containing several small, mainly coastal, settlements, including [[Waitati]], [[Warrington, New Zealand|Warrington]], [[Seacliff, New Zealand|Seacliff]], and [[Waikouaiti]]. [[State Highway 1 (New Zealand)|State Highway 1]] winds steeply through a series of hills here, notably [[The Kilmog]].{{sfn|Dann|Peat|1989}} These hills can be considered a coastal extension of the Silverpeaks Range.

===Environment and Ecotourism===
To the east of Dunedin lies the entirety of the [[Otago Peninsula]], a long finger of land that formed the southeastern rim of the [[Dunedin Volcano]].{{sfn|Dann|Peat|1989}} The peninsula is lightly settled, almost entirely along the harbour coast, and much of it is maintained as a [[Habitat|natural habitat]] by the [[Otago Peninsula Trust]]. The peninsula contains several fine beaches, and is home to a considerable number of [[rare species]] including [[Yellow-eyed penguin|Yellow-eyed]] and [[Little penguin|Little]] penguins, [[pinniped|seals]], and [[Cormorant|shags]]. [[Taiaroa Head]] on the peninsula's northeastern point is a site of global ecological significance, as it is home to the world's only mainland breeding colony of [[southern royal albatross|royal albatross]].

Since local council reorganisation in the late 1980s, these are suburbs, but are not commonly regarded as such.

=== Climate ===
The climate of Dunedin in general is temperate. Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Dunedin features an [[oceanic climate]]. This leads to mild summers and coolish winters. Winter is not particularly frosty with around 49 frosts per year, lower than most other South Island locations, but sunny. Snowfall is not particularly common and significant snowfall is uncommon (perhaps every two or three years), except in the inland hill suburbs such as Halfway Bush and Wakari, which tend to receive a few days of snowfall each year. Spring can feature "four seasons in a day" weather, but from November to April it is generally settled and mild. Temperatures during summer can reach {{convert|30|C}}. Due to its maritime influence, Dunedin's mild summers and mild winters both stand out considering its latitude.

Dunedin has relatively low rainfall in comparison to many of New Zealand's cities, with usually only between 600 and {{convert|750|mm}} recorded per year. However, wet weather is frequent, since much of this rainfall occurs in drizzle or light rain and heavy rain is relatively rare. Dunedin is one of the cloudiest major centres in the country, recording approximately 1,850 hours of bright sunshine per annum.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Lambert|editor-first=M. |date=1988 |title=Air New Zealand almanac |location=Wellington, NZ |publisher=[[New Zealand Press Association]] |pages=394–95 |section=Long-term average, 1951–1980}}</ref> [[Prevailing wind]] in the city is mainly a sometimes cool southwesterly and during late spring will alternate with northeasterlies.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Descriptive Atlas of New Zealand|editor-first=A. H.|editor-last=McLintock |publisher=New Zealand Government Printer |date=1959 |section=Map 8}}</ref> Warmer, dry northwest winds are also characteristic [[Nor'west arch|Foehn winds from the northwest]]. The circle of hills surrounding the [[inner city]] shelters the inner city from much of the prevailing weather, while hills just to the west of the city can often push inclement weather around to the west of the city.

Inland, beyond the heart of the city and into inland Otago, the climate is sub-continental: winters are quite cold and dry, summers warm and dry. Thick freezing ground fogs are common in winter in the upper reaches of the [[Taieri River]]'s course around [[Middlemarch, New Zealand|Middlemarch]], and in summer, the temperature occasionally reaches {{convert|30|C}}.

===Literature===
In December 2014, Dunedin was designated as a [[City of Literature|UNESCO Creative City of Literature]].<ref name="UNESCO" /> Mayor of Dunedin Dave Cull said at the time, "This announcement puts our city on the world map as a first-class literary city. We keep honourable company; other cities bestowed with City of Literature status include Edinburgh, Dublin, Iowa City, Melbourne, Reykjavík, Norwich and Kraków."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofliterature.co.nz/blog/dunedin-thrilled-to-be-unesco-city-of-literature/ |title=Dunedin Thrilled to be UNESCO City of Literature|access-date=4 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113124411/http://www.cityofliterature.co.nz/blog/dunedin-thrilled-to-be-unesco-city-of-literature/|archive-date=13 January 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Dunedin's application was driven by a steering committee and an advisory board of writers, librarians and academics from a range of Dunedin institutions. The bid highlighted the quality of the city's considerable literary heritage, its diverse combination of literary events, businesses, institutions and organisations, plus its thriving community of writers, playwrights and lyricists.

UNESCO established the Creative Cities Network to develop international co-operation among cities and encourage them to drive joint development partnerships in line with UNESCO's global priorities of 'culture and development' and 'sustainable development'. Each city in the network reflects one of UNESCO's seven Creative City themes: folk art, gastronomy, literature, design, film or music. Dunedin is New Zealand's first city to be appointed to the Creative City network.

[[Paul Theroux]] described Dunedin as "cold and frugal with its shabby streets and mock-gothic university". The university students he described as "ignorant, assertive and dirty".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Theroux |first=Paul |title=The Happy Isles of Oceania Paddling the Pacific |publisher=Mariner Books |year=1992 |location=New York |pages=23}}</ref> [[Billy Connolly]] described Dunedin as "a dreary town.

The city in general is a stronghold of the [[New Zealand Labour Party]], having won the Dunedin-based electorate seats continuously since the [[1978 New Zealand general election|1978 election]]. As of the [[2023 New Zealand general election|2023 general election]], both general electorates are held by the party, with [[Rachel Brooking]] representing [[Dunedin_(New_Zealand_electorate)|Dunedin]] and [[Ingrid Leary]] representing [[Taieri_(New_Zealand_electorate)|Taieri]].

Television broadcasts began in Dunedin on 31 July 1962 with the launch of channel [[DNTV2]], the last of the four main centres to receive television. In November 1969, DNTV2 was networked with its counterpart stations in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch to form NZBC TV. In 1975, the NZBC was broken up, with the Wellington and Dunedin studios taking over NZBC TV as [[TVNZ 1|Television One]] (now TVNZ 1) while Auckland and Christchurch studios launched [[TVNZ 2|Television Two]] (now TVNZ 2).

The city is home to several prominent media-related production companies, notably [[Natural History New Zealand]] and [[Taylormade Media]].

The city was once home to the head offices of [[Radio Otago]]—now called [[RadioWorks]] (part of [[MediaWorks New Zealand|Mediaworks]]) and based in Auckland. It was also formerly the home to several now-defunct newspapers, prominent among which were the ''[[Otago Witness]]'' and the ''[[Evening Star (Dunedin)|Evening Star]]''.

{{See also|List of schools in the Otago Region#Dunedin_City}}

=== Secondary ===
Dunedin is home to 12 secondary schools: eight state and four [[state-integrated school|state-integrated]]. The oldest secondary school is state-run [[Otago Boys' High School]], founded in 1863. Its sister school, [[Otago Girls' High School]] (1871) is the oldest state girls' secondary school in New Zealand, even though it preceded the state education system by six years.

Other state schools include [[Bayfield High School, Dunedin|Bayfield High School]], [[Kaikorai Valley College]] and [[Logan Park High School]]. [[King's High School, Dunedin|King's High School]] and [[Queen's High School, Dunedin|Queen's High School]] are single-sex schools based in [[St Clair, New Zealand|St Clair]], and [[Taieri College]] in Mosgiel. The four state-integrated schools are [[Columba College]], a Presbyterian girls' school; [[St. Hilda's Collegiate School]], an Anglican girls' school; [[John McGlashan College]], a Presbyterian boys' school; and [[Trinity Catholic College, Dunedin|Trinity Catholic College]], a Catholic coeducational school.

==Infrastructure and services==
=== Public health and hospitals ===

[[Dunedin Hospital]] is the main public hospital in Dunedin. Other hospitals include:
* Mercy Hospital – a private non-profit hospital opened in 1936 and relocated to Maori Hill in 1969<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mercyhospital.org.nz/about-us/mercy-hospital/overview |title=Welcome to Mercy Hospital|access-date=26 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190526180832/https://www.mercyhospital.org.nz/about-us/mercy-hospital/overview|archive-date=26 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>{{importance inline|date=May 2019}}
* [[Wakari Hospital]]

The Dunedin Hospital and the Wakari Hospital, which are closely related, are operated by [[Te Whatu Ora]]. Ambulance services are provided by [[St John New Zealand]].

=== Utilities ===
[[Aurora Energy (New Zealand)|Aurora Energy]] owns and operates the electricity distribution network servicing the city and the Taieri plains, while OtagoNet Joint Venture owns and operates the electricity distribution network in the rural areas north and west of the city. Electricity is primarily supplied from [[Transpower New Zealand|Transpower]]'s national grid at two substations: Halfway Bush and South Dunedin, with part to the OtagoNet network also supplied from Transpower's [[Naseby, New Zealand|Naseby]] substation in central Otago.

== Transport ==
===Road===
The Dunedin urban area is served by two [[New Zealand state highway network|state highways]], with an additional two state highways and one tourist route serving other parts of the district. The main state highway in Dunedin is [[State Highway 1 (New Zealand)|State Highway 1]], which runs in a north to south-west direction through the middle of the city, connecting Dunedin with Invercargill to the south and Timaru and Christchurch to the north. Between The Oval and Mosgiel, State Highway 1 follows the eleven-kilometre [[Dunedin Southern Motorway]]. [[New Zealand State Highway 88|State Highway 88]] connects central Dunedin to the city's port facilities at [[Port Chalmers]].

Other State Highways in the city are: [[New Zealand State Highway 86|State Highway 86]] connecting SH 1 at Allanton with Dunedin International Airport, [[New Zealand State Highway 87|State Highway 87]] connecting SH 1 at Kinmont with [[New Zealand State Highway 85|SH 85]] at Kyeburn via Middlemarch, serving the Dunedin city hinterland.

Dunedin is the northeastern terminus of the [[Southern Scenic Route]], a tourist highway connecting Dunedin to Te Anau via [[The Catlins]], [[Invercargill]] and [[Fiordland]].

[[File:Dunedinbussy.jpg|thumb|left|Orbus in Dunedin.]]

===Bus===
{{main|Buses in Dunedin}}
Buses in Dunedin are organised by the Otago Regional Council. A total of 64 buses operate on 17 weekday routes and 13 weeknight/weekend/holiday routes across the city. Buses are run by two operators, Ritchies Transport with three routes and Go Bus Transport with the remainder. Dunedin City Council-owned operator [[Citibus (New Zealand)|Citibus]] was a major player until 2011 when Passenger Transport (New Zealand) purchased Citibus from Dunedin City Holdings, and both companies were subsequently bought by Go Bus.

===Rail===
[[Dunedin Railway Station]], located east of the Octagon, is the city's main railway station. Once the nation's busiest, the decline in rail over the years saw the withdrawal of most services. Suburban services ceased in 1982, and the last regular commercial passenger train to serve Dunedin, [[Southerner (New Zealand train)|The Southerner]], was cancelled in February 2002. The [[Taieri Gorge Railway]] now operates tourist-oriented services from the station, the most prominent of which is the Taieri Gorge Limited, which operates daily along the former [[Otago Central Railway]] through the scenic [[Taieri Gorge]]. Taieri Gorge Railway also operates to [[Palmerston, New Zealand|Palmerston]] once weekly. The station is also sometimes visited by excursions organised by other [[heritage railway]] societies, and by trains chartered by [[cruise ship]]s docking at Port Chalmers.

===Air===
[[File:Dunedin International Airport3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dunedin International Airport]] – an Air New Zealand 737 lands on the runway while an Air New Zealand A320 waits on the taxiway]]

[[Dunedin International Airport]] is located {{convert|22|km|2|abbr=on}} southwest of the city, on the [[Taieri Plains]] at [[Momona]]. The airport operates a single terminal and {{convert|1900|m|adj=on}} runway, and is the third-busiest airport in the South Island, after Christchurch and Queenstown. It is primarily used for domestic flights, with regular flights to and from [[Auckland]], [[Christchurch]], [[Wellington]] and charter flights to and from [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]], [[Wānaka]], and [[Invercargill]], but it also has international flights arriving from and departing to [[Brisbane]] year round. In recent years, a decline in international passengers can be attributed to fewer international flights operating direct to the airport.

In 1866, plans were made for a bridge across the [[Otago Harbour]] between Port Chalmers and Portobello,{{sfn|Hayward|1998|p=65}} but this grand scheme for an 1140-metre structure never eventuated. Plans were also mooted during the 1870s for a canal between the Pacific coast at [[Tomahawk, New Zealand|Tomahawk]] and [[Andersons Bay]], close to the head of the harbour.{{sfn|Hayward|1998|p=66}} This scheme also never came to fruition.
