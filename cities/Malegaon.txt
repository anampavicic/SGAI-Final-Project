'''Malegaon''' ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]: ''Mālegāv''; Pronunciation: [[Help:IPA/Marathi|[malegaːʋ]]]) is a city in [[Nashik District]] of [[Maharashtra]] State in [[India]]. Malegaon is one of the largest cities in North Maharashtra. It is situated on the bank of the Girna river with Mosam River river flowing through middle of the city dividing it in two parts. Malegaon is famous for its loom industries.

==History==
Malegaon (previously Maligaon<ref name=mulligaum>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cyQDAAAAYAAJ|title=''A New and Comprehensive Gazetteer''|last1=Wright|first1=George Newenham|year=1837}} G.N. Wright, 1837. See entry for MULLIGAUM, p216.</ref>) at the confluence of the [[Mosam River|Mosam]] (previously Moosy<ref name=mulligaum/>) and [[Girna River|Girna]] rivers.
On the road linking Mumbai and Agra – now [[National highways of India|National Highway]]-3(NH3), it used to be a small junction known as ''Maliwadi'' (hamlet of gardeners).

Malegaon Fort was constructed in 1740 by Naro Shankar Raje Bahadur, general of the [[Peshwa]]. He was appointed as an agent in [[Malwa]]. He was gifted 18 villages which included Malewadi. Craftsmen were brought in from [[Surat]] and northern India to build the fort, the construction of which took 25 years. After the fort was completed, the craftsmen settled in the town.

==Geography==
Malegaon is at the confluence of the [[Girna River|Girna]] and [[Mosam River|Mosam]] rivers, at elevation of 438&nbsp;metres (1437&nbsp;feet) at {{Coord|18.42|N|77.53|E}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/16/Malegaon.html |title=Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Malegaon |publisher=Fallingrain.com |access-date=2013-09-28}}</ref>
