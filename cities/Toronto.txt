===Early history===
{{Main|History of Toronto}}
{{See also|Amalgamation of Toronto}}
The site of Toronto lay at the entrance to one of the oldest routes to the northwest, a route known and used by the Huron, Iroquois, and [[Ojibwe]]. Archaeological sites show evidence of human occupation dating back thousands of years. The site was of strategic importance from the beginning of Ontario's recorded history.{{sfn|Firth|1962|p=3}}

In the 1660s, the [[Iroquois settlement of the north shore of Lake Ontario|Iroquois established two villages]] within what is today Toronto, [[Bead Hill|Ganatsekwyagon]] (Bead Hill) on the banks of the [[Rouge River (Ontario)|Rouge River]] and [[Teiaiagon]] on the banks of the [[Humber River (Ontario)|Humber River]]. By 1701, the [[Mississaugas]] had displaced the Iroquois, who abandoned the Toronto area at the end of the [[Beaver Wars]], with most returning to their homeland in present-day New York state.{{sfn|Schmalz|1991|p=}}

French traders founded [[Fort Rouillé]] in 1750 (the current [[Exhibition Place|Exhibition grounds]] were later developed there), but abandoned it in 1759 during the [[Seven Years' War]].<ref name=rouille>{{cite web |url=http://schools.tdsb.on.ca/jarvisci/toronto/rouille.htm |title=Fort Rouillé |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913004442/http://schools.tdsb.on.ca/jarvisci/toronto/rouille.htm |archive-date=September 13, 2012 |publisher=Jarvis Collegiate Institute |year=2006 |access-date=December 8, 2006}}</ref> The British defeated the French and their indigenous allies in the war, and the area became part of the British colony of [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Quebec]] in 1763.

During the [[American Revolutionary War]], an influx of British settlers arrived there as [[United Empire Loyalist]]s fled for the British-controlled lands north of Lake Ontario. The Crown granted them land to compensate for their losses in the Thirteen Colonies. The new province of Upper Canada was being created and needed a capital. In 1787, the British [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Lord Dorchester]] arranged for the Toronto Purchase with the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation, thereby securing more than a quarter of a million acres (1000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of land in the Toronto area.<ref name=British>[http://www.toronto.ca/culture/history/history-natives-newcomers.htm Natives and newcomers, 1600–1793] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306111515/http://www.toronto.ca/culture/history/history-natives-newcomers.htm |date=March 6, 2007 }}, City of Toronto (2006).

In 1793, Governor [[John Graves Simcoe]] established the town of York on the Toronto Purchase lands, naming it after [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany]]. Simcoe decided to move the Upper Canada capital from [[Niagara-on-the-Lake|Newark]] (Niagara-on-the-Lake) to York,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ontario.ca/en/your_government/004690 |title=History of Ontario's Legislative Buildings |website=ontario.ca |publisher=Government of Ontario |access-date=July 13, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022083250/http://www.ontario.ca/en/your_government/004690 |archive-date=October 22, 2009}}</ref> believing the new site would be less vulnerable to attack by the United States.<ref name="[[Fort York]]">{{cite web |url=http://www.fortyork.ca |title=Welcome to the birthplace of Toronto |website=fortyork.ca |publisher=Friends of Fort York (2006) |access-date=December 8, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221234140/http://www.fortyork.ca/ |archive-date=February 21, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Fort York|York garrison]] was built at the entrance of the town's natural harbour, sheltered by a long sand-bar peninsula.

[[File:TorontoCanadaWest.jpg|thumb|left|Toronto in 1854. The city was a major destination for immigrants to Canada in the second half of the 19th century.]]

As a major destination for immigrants to Canada, the city grew rapidly through the remainder of the 19th century. The first significant wave of immigrants were Irish, fleeing the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]]; most of them were [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]. By 1851, the Irish-born population had become the largest single ethnic group in the city. The Scottish and English population welcomed smaller numbers of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Irish immigrants, some from what is now Northern Ireland, which gave the [[Orange Order]] significant and long-lasting influence over Toronto society. Almost every mayor of Toronto was a member of the Orange Order between 1850 and 1950, and the city was sometimes referred to as the "[[Belfast]] of Canada" because of Orange influence in municipal politics and administration.<ref>{{cite web |title=Orange Order in Canada {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/orange-order |website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca |access-date=March 16, 2023 |archive-date=March 16, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230316182908/https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/orange-order |url-status=live}}</ref>

For brief periods, Toronto was twice the capital of the united [[Province of Canada]]: first from 1849 to 1851, following unrest in Montreal, and later from 1855 to 1859. After this date, Quebec was designated as the capital until 1865 (two years before Canadian Confederation). Since then, the capital of Canada has remained [[Ottawa]], Ontario.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statoids.com/uca.html |title=Canada Provinces |website=Statoids.com |access-date=April 17, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223215649/http://www.statoids.com/uca.html |archive-date=February 23, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Toronto became the capital of the province of Ontario after its official creation in 1867. The seat of government of the Ontario briefly returned to the same building that hosted the Third Parliament Building of Upper Canada, before moving to the [[Ontario Legislative Building]] at [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queen's Park]] in 1893. Because of its provincial capital status, the city was also the location of [[Government House (Ontario)|Government House]], the residence of the [[viceroy|viceregal]] representative of [[Monarchy of Canada|the Crown]] [[Monarchy in Ontario|in right of Ontario]].

Long before the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] was established in 1876, supporters of the concept proposed military colleges in Canada. Staffed by British Regulars, adult male students underwent a three-month-long military course at the School of Military Instruction in Toronto. Established by Militia General Order in 1864, the school enabled officers of militia or candidates for commission or promotion in the Militia to learn military duties, drill and discipline, to command a company at Battalion Drill, to drill a company at Company Drill, the internal economy of a company, and the duties of a company's officer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~theislands/photos6/ansonkeillmilcert.jpg |title=Province of Canada : Second Class Certificate |website=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |format=JPG |access-date=June 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407162844/http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~theislands/photos6/ansonkeillmilcert.jpg |archive-date=April 7, 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The school was retained at Confederation, in 1867.

In the 19th century, the city built an extensive sewage system to improve sanitation, and streets were illuminated with [[gas lighting]] as a regular service.{{citation needed |date=September 2023}} Long-distance railway lines were constructed, including a route completed in 1854 linking Toronto with the Upper Great Lakes. The [[Grand Trunk Railway]] and the [[Northern Railway of Canada]] joined in the building of the first [[Toronto Union Station (1858)|Union Station]] in downtown. The advent of the railway dramatically increased the numbers of immigrants arriving, commerce and industry, as had the Lake Ontario steamers and schooners entering port before. These enabled Toronto to become a major gateway linking the world to the interior of the North American continent. Expanding port and rail facilities brought in northern timber for export and imported Pennsylvania coal. Industry dominated the waterfront for the next 100 years.

During the late 19th century, Toronto became the largest alcohol distillation (in particular, [[Distilled beverage|spirits]]) centre in North America. By the 1860s, the [[Gooderham and Worts]] Distillery operations became the world's largest [[whisky]] factory.{{citation needed |date=September 2023}} A preserved section of this once dominant local industry remains in the [[Distillery District]]. The harbour allowed access to grain and sugar imports used in processing.

Horse-drawn [[Tram|streetcars]] gave way to electric streetcars in 1891 when the city granted the operation of the transit franchise to the [[Toronto Railway Company]]. The public transit system passed into public ownership in 1921 as the [[Toronto Transportation Commission]], later renamed the [[Toronto Transit Commission]]. The system now has [[List of North American rapid transit systems by ridership|the third-highest ridership of any city public transportation system in North America]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013153812/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1122072619227_40/?hub=CTVNewsAt11 |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1122072619227_40/?hub=CTVNewsAt11 |work=CTV News |title=Toronto transit chief says searches unlikely |date=July 24, 2005 |archive-date=October 13, 2007}}</ref>

The city received new European immigrant groups from the late 19th century into the early 20th century, particularly Germans, French, Italians, and Jews. They were soon followed by Russians, Poles, and other Eastern European nations, in addition to the Chinese entering from the West. Like the Irish before them, many of these migrants lived in overcrowded shanty-type slums, such as "[[The Ward, Toronto|the Ward]]", which was centred on [[Bay Street]], now the heart of the country's [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]].

As new migrants began to prosper, they moved to better housing in other areas, in what is now understood to be succession waves of settlement. Despite its fast-paced growth, by the 1920s, Toronto's population and economic importance in Canada remained second to the much longer established [[Montreal]], Quebec. However, by 1934, the Toronto Stock Exchange had become the largest in the country.

In 1954, the City of Toronto and 12 surrounding municipalities were federated into a [[regional municipality|regional government]] known as [[Metropolitan Toronto]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/repealedstatutes/english/elaws_rep_statutes_90m62_e.htm |title=Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act |website=e-laws.gov.on.ca |publisher=[[Government of Ontario]] |year=2000 |access-date=December 29, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105121125/http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/repealedstatutes/english/elaws_rep_statutes_90m62_e.htm |archive-date=January 5, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> The postwar boom had resulted in rapid suburban development. It was believed a coordinated land-use strategy and shared services would provide greater efficiency for the region. The metropolitan government began to manage services that crossed municipal boundaries, including highways, police services, water and [[Public transport|public transit]]. In that year, a half-century after the Great Fire of 1904, disaster struck the city again when [[Hurricane Hazel]] brought intense winds and flash flooding. In the Toronto area, 81 people were killed, nearly 1,900 families were left homeless, and the hurricane caused more than {{CAD|25&nbsp;million}} in damage.<ref name=hurricane>{{cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/sos/002028-3200-e.html |title=SOS!

In 1967, the seven smallest municipalities of Metropolitan Toronto were merged with larger neighbours, resulting in a six-municipality configuration that included the [[Old Toronto|former city of Toronto]] and the surrounding municipalities of [[East York]], [[Etobicoke]], [[North York]], [[Scarborough, Ontario|Scarborough]], and [[York, Toronto|York]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mathwizurd.com/history/2015/5/8/why-is-toronto-called-the-6 |title=Why is Toronto Called the Six |first=David |last=Witten |year=2016 |access-date=June 2, 2017 |website=mathwizurd.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506170417/http://www.mathwizurd.com/history/2015/5/8/why-is-toronto-called-the-6 |archive-date=May 6, 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the decades after World War II, refugees from war-torn Europe and Chinese job-seekers arrived, as well as construction labourers, particularly from Italy and Portugal. Toronto's population grew to more than one million in 1951 when large-scale suburbanization began and doubled to two million by 1971. Following the elimination of racially based immigration policies by the late 1960s, Toronto became a destination for immigrants from all over the world. By the 1980s, Toronto had surpassed Montreal as Canada's most populous city and chief economic hub. During this time, in part owing to the political uncertainty raised by the resurgence of the [[Quebec sovereignty movement]], many national and multinational corporations moved their head offices from Montreal to Toronto and [[Western Canada|Western Canadian]] cities.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3683/is_200201/ai_n9069631/pg_1 |title=Westward ho?

On January 1, 1998, Toronto was greatly enlarged, not through traditional [[annexation]]s, but as an [[Merger (politics)|amalgamation]] of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto and its six lower-tier constituent municipalities: East York, Etobicoke, North York, Scarborough, York, and the original city itself. They were dissolved by an act of the [[Government of Ontario]] and formed into a single-tier City of Toronto (colloquially dubbed the "[[merger (politics)#Canada|megacity]]"), replacing all six governments.

The merger was proposed as a cost-saving measure by the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative]] provincial government under premier [[Mike Harris]]. The announcement touched off vociferous public objections. In March 1997, a [[referendum]] in all six municipalities produced a vote of more than 3:1 against amalgamation.<ref>Chidley, Joe; Hawelshka, Danilo. [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/torontos-struggle-against-amalgamation/ Toronto's struggle against amalgamation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191216004153/https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/torontos-struggle-against-amalgamation |date=December 16, 2019 }}.

The Harris government could thus legally ignore the referendum results and did so in April when it tabled the ''[[City of Toronto Act]]''. Both [[parliamentary opposition|opposition parties]] [[filibuster#Provincial|held a filibuster]] in the provincial legislature, proposing more than 12,000 amendments that allowed residents on streets of the proposed megacity to take part in public hearings on the merger and adding historical designations to the streets.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/english/issue.asp?param=64&art=75 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130101022300/http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/english/issue.asp?param=64&art=75 |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 1, 2013 |title=Legislative Reports |magazine=Canadian Parliamentary Review}}</ref> This only delayed the bill's inevitable passage, given the Progressive Conservatives' majority.

The [[Toronto Islands]] and [[Port Lands]] extend out into the lake, allowing for a somewhat sheltered [[Toronto Harbour]] south of the downtown core.<ref name="northwest">{{cite web |url=http://www.toronto.ca/attractions/getting_here.htm |title=Getting Here |website=toronto.ca |publisher=City of Toronto |access-date=February 14, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705224859/http://www.toronto.ca/attractions/getting_here.htm |archive-date=July 5, 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref> An Outer Harbour was constructed southeast of downtown during the 1950s and 1960s, and it is now used for recreation. The city's limits are formed by Lake Ontario to the south, the western boundary of [[Marie Curtis Park]], [[Etobicoke Creek]], [[Eglinton Avenue]] and [[Ontario Highway 427|Highway 427]] to the west, [[Steeles Avenue]] to the north and the [[Rouge River (Ontario)|Rouge River]] and the Scarborough–Pickering Townline to the east.

===Topography===
{{further|Toronto ravine system}}
{{More citations needed section|date=July 2016}}
[[File:Leaside Bridge 2023.jpg|thumb|[[Leaside Bridge]] crossing the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don valley ravine]]. The [[Toronto ravine system]] and its [[Toronto waterway system|waterways]] cut through the city's landscape.]]
The city is mostly flat or gentle hills, and the land gently slopes upward away from the lake. The flat land is interrupted by the [[Toronto ravine system]], which is cut by numerous creeks and rivers of the [[Toronto waterway system]], most notably the Humber River in the west end, the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]] east of downtown (these two rivers flanking and defining the Toronto Harbour), and the Rouge River at the city's eastern limits. Most of the ravines and valley lands in Toronto today are parklands and recreational trails are laid out along the ravines and valleys. The original town was laid out in a [[grid plan]] on the flat plain north of the harbour, and this plan was extended outwards as the city grew. The width and depth of several of the ravines and valleys are such that several grid streets, such as [[Finch Avenue]], [[Leslie Street]], [[Lawrence Avenue]], and [[St. Clair Avenue]], terminate on one side of a ravine or valley and continue on the other side. Toronto has many bridges spanning the ravines. Large bridges such as the [[Prince Edward Viaduct]] were built to span broad river valleys.

Despite its deep ravines, Toronto is not remarkably hilly, but its elevation does increase steadily away from the lake. Elevation differences range from {{convert|76.5|m|ft|0|abbr=}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] at the Lake Ontario shore to {{convert|209|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level near the [[York University]] grounds in the city's north end at the intersection of [[Keele Street]] and Steeles Avenue.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/toronto-at-a-glance/ |title=City of Toronto: Toronto at a Glance, Geography |website=Toronto.ca |date=November 14, 2017 |publisher=City of Toronto |access-date=March 7, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425115350/https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/toronto-at-a-glance/ |archive-date=April 25, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> There are occasional hilly areas; in particular, [[Midtown, Toronto|midtown Toronto]], as well as the [[Silverthorn, Toronto|Silverthorn]] and [[Fairbank, Toronto|Fairbank]] neighbourhoods, have several sharply sloping hills. Lake Ontario remains occasionally visible from the peaks of these ridges as far north as Eglinton Avenue, {{convert|7|to|8|km|mi}} inland.
[[File:Topographical Map of Toronto.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Topographical map of Toronto. The terrain increases steadily away from the shoreline.]]
The other major geographical feature of Toronto is its escarpments. During the [[Last Glacial Period|last ice age]], the lower part of Toronto was beneath [[Glacial Lake Iroquois]]. Today, a series of [[escarpment]]s mark the lake's former boundary, known as the "Iroquois Shoreline". The escarpments are most prominent from [[Victoria Park Avenue]] to the mouth of [[Highland Creek (Toronto)|Highland Creek]], where they form the [[Scarborough Bluffs]]. Other observable sections include the area near St. Clair Avenue West between [[Bathurst Street (Toronto)|Bathurst Street]] and the Don River, and north of [[Davenport Road]] from Caledonia to [[Spadina Avenue|Spadina Road]]; the [[Casa Loma]] grounds sit above this escarpment.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.blogto.com/city/2012/07/a_brief_history_of_the_lake_iroquois_shoreline_in_toronto/ |title=A brief history of the Lake Iroquois shoreline in Toronto |website=www.blogto.com |language=en |access-date=April 28, 2020 |archive-date=April 14, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200414000450/https://www.blogto.com/city/2012/07/a_brief_history_of_the_lake_iroquois_shoreline_in_toronto/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

The geography of the lakeshore has dramatically changed since the first settlement of Toronto. Much of the land on the harbour's north shore is landfill, filled in during the late 19th century. Until then, the lakefront docks (then known as wharves) were set back farther inland than today. Much of the adjacent Port Lands on the harbour's east side was a [[wetland]] filled in early in the 20th century.<ref name="utoronto1">{{cite web |url=http://maps.library.utoronto.ca/dvhmp/ashbridges-bay.html |title=Don River Valley Historical Mapping Project |publisher=Maps.library.utoronto.ca |access-date=July 14, 2016 |archive-date=May 24, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160524162113/http://maps.library.utoronto.ca/dvhmp/ashbridges-bay.html |url-status=live}}</ref> The shoreline from the harbour west to the Humber River has been extended into the lake. Further west, landfill has been used to create extensions of land such as Humber Bay Park.
[[File:Views from the CN Tower Laslovarga (20).JPG|thumb|View of the [[Toronto Islands]], an island chain that bounds [[Toronto Harbour#Inner Harbour|Toronto's Inner Harbour]]]]
The Toronto Islands were a natural peninsula until a storm in 1858 severed their connection to the mainland,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://nowtoronto.com/news/tempestuous-isle/ |title=Tempestuous isle: A tragic history of Toronto Islands |last=Longley |first=Richard |date=September 14, 2017 |work=NOW Magazine |access-date=February 14, 2018 |language=en-us |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215084610/https://nowtoronto.com/news/tempestuous-isle/ |archive-date=February 15, 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> creating a channel to the harbour. The peninsula was formed by [[longshore drift]] taking the sediments deposited along the Scarborough Bluffs shore and transporting them to the Islands area.

The other source of sediment for the Port Lands wetland and the peninsula was the deposition of the Don River, which carved a wide valley through the sedimentary land of Toronto and deposited it in the shallow harbour. The harbour and the channel of the Don River have been dredged numerous times for shipping. The lower section of the Don River was straightened and channelled in the 19th century. The former mouth drained into a wetland; today, the Don River drains into the harbour through a concrete waterway, the [[Keating Channel]]. To mitigate flooding in the area, as well as to create parkland, a second more natural mouth is being built to the south during the first half of the 2020s, thereby creating [[Villiers Island]].

===Neighbourhoods and former municipalities===
{{main|History of neighbourhoods in Toronto|List of neighbourhoods in Toronto}}
[[File:Toronto map.png|thumb|Map of Toronto with major traffic routes. Also shown are the limits of [[Metropolitan Toronto|six former municipalities]], which form the current City of Toronto.]]

Toronto encompasses an area formerly administered by several separate municipalities that were amalgamated over the years. Each developed a distinct history and identity over the years, and their names remain in common use among Torontonians. Former municipalities include East York, Etobicoke, [[Forest Hill, Toronto|Forest Hill]], [[Mimico]], North York, [[Parkdale, Toronto|Parkdale]], Scarborough, [[Swansea, Toronto|Swansea]], [[Weston, Toronto|Weston]] and York. Throughout the city, there exist hundreds of small neighbourhoods and some larger neighbourhoods covering a few square kilometres.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

The many residential communities of Toronto express a character distinct from the skyscrapers in the commercial core. [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian-era]] residential buildings can be found in enclaves such as [[Rosedale, Toronto|Rosedale]], [[Cabbagetown, Toronto|Cabbagetown]], [[The Annex]], and [[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Edwardian Residential Architecture In Toronto – Urbaneer – Toronto Real Estate, Blog, Condos, Homes |url=https://www.urbaneer.com/blog/edwardian_residential_architecture_in_toronto |access-date=April 4, 2021 |website=www.urbaneer.com |archive-date=April 13, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210413163101/https://www.urbaneer.com/blog/edwardian_residential_architecture_in_toronto |url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Wychwood Park]] neighbourhood, historically significant for the architecture of its homes, and for being one of Toronto's earliest planned communities, was designated as an Ontario Heritage Conservation district in 1985.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.torontoneighbourhoods.net/neighbourhoods/midtown/wychwood-park/history |title=History of Wychwood Park |website=torontoneighbourhoods.net |publisher=Maple Tree Publishing |access-date=July 16, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822005638/http://www.torontoneighbourhoods.net/neighbourhoods/midtown/wychwood-park/history |archive-date=August 22, 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[Casa Loma (neighbourhood)|Casa Loma]] neighbourhood is named after "Casa Loma", a castle built in 1911 by [[Henry Pellatt|Sir Henry Pellat]], complete with gardens, turrets, stables, an elevator, secret passages, and a bowling alley.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.casaloma.org/ |title=Casa Loma |website=casaloma.org |publisher=Liberty Entertainment Group |access-date=July 16, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712101236/http://www.casaloma.org/ |archive-date=July 12, 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Spadina House]] is a 19th-century [[manor house|manor]] that is now a museum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=919d2271635af310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD |title=Spadina Museum: Historic House & Gardens |website=toronto.ca |publisher=City of Toronto |access-date=July 16, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704082331/http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=919d2271635af310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD |archive-date=July 4, 2016 }}</ref>

====Old Toronto====
[[File:Cabbagetown houses.jpg|thumb|[[Victorian architecture|Victorian]]-era [[Bay-and-gable]] houses are a distinct architectural [[List of house types|style of residence]] that is ubiquitous throughout the older neighbourhoods of Toronto.]]
The pre-amalgamation City of Toronto covers the downtown core and older neighbourhoods to the east, west, and north. It is the most densely populated part of the city. The Financial District contains the [[First Canadian Place]], [[Toronto-Dominion Centre]], [[Scotia Plaza]], [[Royal Bank Plaza]], [[Commerce Court]] and [[Brookfield Place (Toronto)|Brookfield Place]]. This area includes, among others, the neighbourhoods of [[St. James Town]], [[Garden District, Toronto|Garden District]], [[St. Lawrence, Toronto|St. Lawrence]], [[Corktown, Toronto|Corktown]], and [[Church and Wellesley]]. From that point, the Toronto skyline extends northward along Yonge Street.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

Old Toronto is also home to many historically wealthy residential enclaves, such as [[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville]], Rosedale, The Annex, Forest Hill, [[Lawrence Park, Toronto|Lawrence Park]], [[Lytton Park]], [[Deer Park, Toronto|Deer Park]], [[Moore Park, Toronto|Moore Park]], and Casa Loma, most stretching away from downtown to the north.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}
East and west of downtown, neighbourhoods such as [[Kensington Market]], [[Chinatown, Toronto|Chinatown]], [[Leslieville]], [[Cabbagetown, Toronto|Cabbagetown]] and [[Riverdale, Toronto|Riverdale]] are home to bustling commercial and cultural areas as well as communities of artists with studio lofts, with many middle- and upper-class professionals.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}
Other neighbourhoods in the central city retain an ethnic identity, including two smaller Chinatowns, the [[Greektown, Toronto|Greektown]] area, [[Little Italy, Toronto|Little Italy]], [[Little Portugal, Toronto|Portugal Village]], and [[Gerrard Street (Toronto)|Little India]], among others.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Usmani |first=Zain |date=March 27, 2023 |title=Toronto Neighbourhoods {{!}} Ethnic Enclaves to Discover - Prepare For Canada |url=https://www.prepareforcanada.com/before-you-arrive/settling-in-canada/toronto-neighbourhoods-ethnic-enclaves-to-discover/ |access-date=April 10, 2023 |website=www.prepareforcanada.com |language=en-US |archive-date=April 10, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230410051934/https://www.prepareforcanada.com/before-you-arrive/settling-in-canada/toronto-neighbourhoods-ethnic-enclaves-to-discover/ |url-status=live}}</ref><!--There is no need to list every ethnic enclave in Toronto; see [[List of neighbourhoods in Toronto]] instead-->

During the 2000s, many neighbourhoods became ethnically diverse and underwent [[gentrification]] due to increasing population and a housing boom during the late 1990s and the early 21st century. The first neighbourhoods affected were [[Leaside]] and [[North Toronto]], gradually progressing into the western neighbourhoods in York.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

====Industrial====
[[File:Toronto's Distillery District in 2023 (52716109425).jpg|thumb|The [[Distillery District]] holds the most extensive collection of preserved Victorian industrial architecture in North America.]]
In the 1800s, a thriving industrial area developed around Toronto Harbour and the lower Don River mouth, linked by rail and water to Canada and the United States. Examples included the Gooderham and Worts Distillery, Canadian Malting Company, the Toronto Rolling Mills, the Union Stockyards and the [[William Davies Company|Davies pork processing facility]] (the inspiration for the "Hogtown" nickname).<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Matthews |first1=Geoffrey J. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tWkxht1Oa8EC&q=In+the+1800s%2C+a+thriving+industrial+area+developed+around+Toronto+Harbour&pg=PA162 |title=Historical Atlas of Canada: The land transformed, 1800–1891 |last2=Measner |first2=Don |date=January 1, 1987 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=978-0-8020-3447-2 |language=en |access-date=April 12, 2021 |archive-date=September 14, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230914171830/https://books.google.com/books?id=tWkxht1Oa8EC&q=In+the+1800s%2C+a+thriving+industrial+area+developed+around+Toronto+Harbour&pg=PA162 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=R |first=Thais |title=Why Is Toronto Called Hogtown? |url=https://newcanadianlife.com/why-is-toronto-called-hogtown/ |access-date=April 4, 2021 |website=New Canadian Life |language=en-US |archive-date=May 13, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210513025145/https://newcanadianlife.com/why-is-toronto-called-hogtown/ |url-status=live}}</ref> This industrial area expanded west along the harbour and rail lines and was supplemented by the infilling of the marshlands on the east side of the harbour to create the Port Lands. A garment industry developed along lower Spadina Avenue, the "[[Fashion District, Toronto|Fashion District]]". Beginning in the late 19th century, industrial areas were set up on the outskirts, such as [[The Junction|West Toronto / The Junction]], where the Stockyards relocated in 1903.<ref name="stockyards">{{cite web |url=http://torontohistory.net/junction-stockyards.html |title=Junction Stockyards |website=torontohistory.net |publisher=Toronto Historical Association |access-date=September 13, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914035408/http://torontohistory.net/junction-stockyards.html |archive-date=September 14, 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The Great Fire of 1904 destroyed a large amount of industry in the downtown.

Many of Toronto's [[Brownfield land|former industrial sites]] close to (or in) downtown have been redeveloped, including parts of the Toronto waterfront, the rail yards west of downtown, and [[Liberty Village]], the Massey-Harris district and large-scale development is underway in the [[West Don Lands]].{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}
The Gooderham & Worts Distillery produced spirits until 1990 and is preserved today as the "Distillery District", the largest and best-preserved collection of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] industrial architecture in North America.{{sfn|Gibson|2008}} Some industry remains in the area, including the [[Redpath Sugar Refinery]]. Similar areas that retain their industrial character but are now largely residential are the Fashion District, Corktown, and parts of South Riverdale and Leslieville. Toronto still has some active older industrial areas, such as [[Brockton Village]], Mimico and New Toronto. In the west end of Old Toronto and York, the Weston/[[Mount Dennis]] and The Junction areas still contain factories, meat-packing facilities and rail yards close to medium-density residential. However, the Junction's Union Stockyards moved out of Toronto in 1994.<ref name="stockyards"/>

Toronto is a city of high-rises and had 1,875 buildings over {{convert|30|m|ft}} as of 2011.<ref>Most of these buildings are residential. In contrast, the central business district contains commercial office towers. There has been recent attention given to the need to retrofit many of these buildings, which were constructed beginning in the 1950s as residential apartment blocks to accommodate a quickly growing population. As of November 2011, the city had 132 high-rise buildings under construction. {{cite web |date=October 5, 2011 |title=Highrises?

Toronto has diverse public spaces, from city squares to public parks overlooking ravines. [[Nathan Phillips Square]] is the city's main square in downtown, contains the [[Toronto Sign]],<ref>{{cite web |date=June 21, 2016 |title=Iconic Toronto sign starting to show wear, needs funding to survive |url=https://toronto.citynews.ca/2016/06/21/iconic-toronto-sign-starting-to-show-wear-needs-funding-to-survive/ |access-date=May 3, 2020 |website=CityNews Toronto |archive-date=May 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200517223859/https://toronto.citynews.ca/2016/06/21/iconic-toronto-sign-starting-to-show-wear-needs-funding-to-survive/ |url-status=live}}</ref> and forms the entrance to [[Toronto City Hall|City Hall]]. [[Yonge–Dundas Square]], near City Hall, has also gained attention in recent years as one of the busiest gathering spots in the city. Other squares include [[Harbourfront Centre|Harbourfront Square]], on the Toronto waterfront, and the civic squares at the former city halls of the defunct Metropolitan Toronto, most notably [[Mel Lastman Square]] in North York. The [[Toronto Public Space Committee]] is an advocacy group concerned with the city's public spaces. In recent years, Nathan Phillips Square has been refurbished with new facilities, and the central waterfront along Queen's Quay West has been updated recently with a new street architecture and a new square next to Harbourfront Centre.
[[File:Toronto City Hall (25383892988).jpg|thumb|[[Nathan Phillips Square]] is the city's main square. The square includes a reflecting pool that is converted into an [[ice rink]] during the winter.]]
In the winter, Nathan Phillips Square, Harbourfront Centre, and Mel Lastman Square feature popular rinks for public ice skating. Etobicoke's Colonel Sam Smith Trail opened in 2011 and is Toronto's first skating trail. [[Earl Bales Park]] offers outdoor skiing and snowboarding slopes with a [[chairlift]], rental facilities, and lessons. Several parks have marked cross-country skiing trails.

There are many large downtown parks, which include [[Allan Gardens]], [[Christie Pits]], [[Grange Park (Toronto)|Grange Park]], [[Little Norway Park]], [[Moss Park]], [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queen's Park]], [[Riverdale Park (Toronto)|Riverdale Park]] and [[Trinity Bellwoods Park]].

Most ravine lands and river bank floodplains in Toronto are public parklands.

Although much of the region's manufacturing activities occur outside the city limits, Toronto continues to be a wholesale and distribution point for the industrial sector. The city's strategic position along the [[Quebec City–Windsor Corridor]] within the [[Great Lakes megalopolis]] and its road and rail connections help support the nearby production of motor vehicles, iron, steel, food, machinery, chemicals and paper. The completion of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] in 1959 gave ships access to the [[Great Lakes]] from the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

=== Government ===
Toronto is a [[single-tier municipality]] governed by a [[Mayor–council government|mayor–council system]]. The structure of the municipal government is stipulated by the ''City of Toronto Act''. The mayor of Toronto is elected by direct popular vote to serve as the [[Head of government|chief executive]] of the city. The [[Toronto City Council]] is a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] legislative body, comprising 25 councillors, since the [[2018 Toronto municipal election|2018 municipal election]], representing geographical [[Ward (electoral subdivision)|wards]] throughout the city.<ref name="Council Members" /> The mayor and members of the city council serve four-year terms without [[term limit]]s. (Until the [[2006 Toronto municipal election|2006 municipal election]], the mayor and city councillors served three-year terms.)
[[File:Cityhalltoronto1.JPG|thumb|left|[[Toronto City Hall]] is the seat of the [[municipal government of Toronto]].]]
As of 2016, the city council has twelve standing committees, each consisting of a chair (some have a vice-chair) and several councillors.<ref name="TCC">{{cite web |title=Toronto City Council and Committees |url=http://app.toronto.ca/tmmis/decisionBodyList.do?function=prepareDisplayDBList |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708052705/http://app.toronto.ca/tmmis/decisionBodyList.do?function=prepareDisplayDBList |archive-date=July 8, 2016 |access-date=July 17, 2016 |publisher=City of Toronto}}</ref> The mayor names the committee chairs and the remaining members of the committees are appointed by city council. An executive committee is formed by the chairs of each standing committee, the mayor, the deputy mayor and four other councillors. Councillors are also appointed to oversee the Toronto Transit Commission and the [[Toronto Police Services Board]].

The city has four community councils that consider local matters.

Toronto is a central transportation hub for road, rail, and air networks in Southern Ontario. The city has many forms of transport, including [[400-series highways|highways]] and [[public transportation in Toronto|public transit]]. Toronto also has an extensive [[Cycling in Toronto|network of bicycle lanes]] and multi-use trails and paths.

=== Public transportation ===
{{Main|Public transportation in Toronto}}<!--Please do not insert subway map-->
Toronto's primary public transportation system is operated by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC).<ref name="autogenerated1" /> The backbone of its public transport network is the [[Toronto subway]] system, which includes three heavy-rail rapid transit lines spanning the city, including the U-shaped [[Line 1 Yonge–University|Line 1]], east–west [[Line 2 Bloor–Danforth|Line 2]], and the short east–west [[Line 4 Sheppard|Line 4]] with Line 1 extending as far beyond city limits as [[Vaughan Metropolitan Centre]].
[[File:Flexity_Outlook_(Toronto_streetcar);_September_2019.jpg|thumb|A [[Toronto streetcar system|TTC streetcar]] on King Street. The streetcar system is the largest and [[List of North American light rail systems by ridership|busiest system in North America]].]]
The TTC also operates an extensive network of [[Toronto Transit Commission bus system|buses]] and [[Toronto streetcar system|streetcars]], with the latter serving the downtown core and buses serving many parts of the city not served by the sparse subway network. TTC buses and streetcars use the same fare system as the subway, and many subway stations offer a fare-paid area for transfers between rail and surface vehicles.

There have been numerous plans to extend the subway and implement light-rail lines, but budgetary concerns have thwarted many efforts. By November 2011, construction on [[Line 5 Eglinton]] began.

=== Intercity transportation ===
[[Union Station (Toronto)|Toronto Union Station]] serves as a hub for VIA Rail's intercity services in Central Canada and includes services to various parts of Ontario, ''Corridor'' services to Montreal and national capital Ottawa, and long-distance services to Vancouver and New York City.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://torontounion.ca/visit/ |title=Visit – Toronto Union Station |website=Torontounion.ca |date=May 16, 2019 |access-date=December 29, 2023 |archive-date=December 30, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231230031416/https://torontounion.ca/visit/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

GO Transit provides intercity bus services from the Union Station Bus Terminal and other bus terminals in the city to destinations within the Golden Horseshoe. Long-distance [[intercity coach service]]s by multiple companies also operated from the Union Station Bus Terminal and provide a network of services to further cities in Ontario, neighbouring provinces, and the United States. The [[Toronto Coach Terminal]] formerly served as the city's intercity coach hub from 1931 to 2021, when the terminal was decommissioned.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/toronto-s-bay-street-bus-terminal-reaches-the-end-of-the-line/article_de501ce7-8020-5984-8ed6-64b43addc019.html |website=www.thestar.com |date=June 9, 2021 |last=Spurr |first=Ben |title=Toronto's Bay Street bus terminal reaches the end of the line |publisher=Toronto Star Newspaper |access-date=September 24, 2023 |archive-date=October 2, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231002101051/https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/toronto-s-bay-street-bus-terminal-reaches-the-end-of-the-line/article_de501ce7-8020-5984-8ed6-64b43addc019.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Airports ===
[[File:Pearson International.JPG|thumb|Interior of [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]]'s Terminal 1. Toronto Pearson serves as the [[international airport]] for the [[Greater Toronto Area]].]]

Canada's busiest airport, [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]] ([[IATA airport code|IATA]]: YYZ), straddles the city's western boundary with the suburban city of Mississauga. The Union Pearson Express (UP Express) train service provides a direct link between Pearson International and Union Station. It began carrying passengers in June 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.torontopearson.com/en/corporate/who-we-are |title=Who we are |publisher=[[Toronto Pearson International Airport]] |access-date=December 29, 2023 |archive-date=December 30, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231230030621/https://www.torontopearson.com/en/corporate/who-we-are |url-status=live}}</ref>{{bsn|date=June 2024}}

Limited commercial and passenger service to nearby destinations in Canada and the United States is offered from the [[Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport]] (IATA: YTZ) on the Toronto Islands, southwest of downtown. [[Buttonville Municipal Airport]] (IATA: YKZ) in [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]] provides [[general aviation]] facilities. [[Downsview Airport]] (IATA: YZD), near the city's north end, is owned by [[de Havilland Canada]] and serves the [[Bombardier Aviation]] aircraft factory.

Within a few hours' drive, Hamilton's [[John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport|John C. Munro International Airport]] (IATA: YHM) and Buffalo's [[Buffalo Niagara International Airport]] (IATA: BUF) serve as alternate airports for the Toronto area in addition to serving their respective cities. A [[Pickering Airport Lands|secondary international airport]], to be located northeast of Toronto in [[Pickering, Ontario|Pickering]], has been planned by the Government of Canada.

=== Streets and highways ===
[[File:Highway 401 Densification.jpg|thumb|[[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]] is a [[400-series highways|400-series highway]] that passes west to east through Greater Toronto. Toronto's portion of Highway 401 is the busiest highway in North America.]]
The grid of major city streets was laid out by a [[concession road]] system, in which major [[arterial road]]s are {{convert|6600|ft|km|1|abbr=on}} apart (with some exceptions, particularly in Scarborough and Etobicoke, as they used a different survey). Major east-west arterial roads are generally parallel with the Lake Ontario shoreline, and major north–south arterial roads are roughly perpendicular to the shoreline, though slightly angled north of Eglinton Avenue. This arrangement is sometimes broken by geographical accidents, most notably the Don River ravines. Toronto's grid north is approximately 18.5° to the west of true north. Many arterials, particularly north–south ones, due to the city originally being within the former [[York County, Ontario|York County]], continue beyond the city into the [[Area code 905|905 suburbs]] and further into the rural countryside.

There are several municipal [[limited-access road|expressways]] and [[Ontario Provincial Highway Network|provincial highways]] that serve Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area. In particular, [[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]] bisects the city from west to east, bypassing the downtown core.
