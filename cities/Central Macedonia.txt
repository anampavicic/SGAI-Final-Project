'''Central Macedonia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|æ|s|ə|ˈ|d|oʊ|n|i|ə}} {{respell|MASS|ə|DOH|nee|ə}}; {{langx|el|Κεντρική Μακεδονία|Kentrikí Makedonía}}, {{IPA-el|ce(n)driˈci maceðoˈni.a|IPA}}) is one of the thirteen [[Regions of Greece|administrative regions]] of [[Greece]], consisting of the central part of the [[Macedonia (region)|geographical and historical region of Macedonia]]. With a population of almost 1.8 million, it is the second most populous region in Greece after [[Attica (region)|Attica]].

==Geography==
The region of Central Macedonia is situated in [[Northern Greece]], bordering the [[Administrative regions of Greece|regions]] of [[Western Macedonia]] (west), [[Thessaly]] (south), [[Eastern Macedonia and Thrace]] (east), and bounded to the north at the international borders of Greece by the [[Republic of North Macedonia]] and [[Bulgaria]]. The southern part is coastal and is bathed by the [[Thermaic Gulf|Thermaic]], [[Toronean Gulf|Toroneos]], [[Singitic Gulf|Singitic]] and [[Strymonian Gulf|Strymonic]] gulfs. The largest city and capital of the region is [[Thessaloniki]]. [[Serres]] is the second most populous city, followed by [[Katerini]], [[Veria]] and [[Giannitsa]]. Central Macedonia is basically lowland and, with many rivers, is highly developed, both in the primary and the secondary sectors. The largest plain in [[Greece]] is situated in Central Macedonia. [[Thessaloniki]], the metropolis of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], is Greece's second largest city. The highest mountains of the region of Central Macedonia are [[Mount Olympus]] (2,918 m.), [[Voras Mountains]] (2,524 m.), [[Pierian Mountains]] (2,193 m.), [[Vermio Mountains]] (2,065 m.) and [[Mount Athos]] (2,033 m.). The largest rivers are the [[Haliacmon]], the [[Vardar|Axios]], the [[Loudias River|Loudias]] and the [[Gallikos (river)|Gallikos (Echedoros)]], which all flow into the [[Thermaic Gulf]], creating the [[Axios Delta National Park|Axios-Loudias-Aliakmonas National Park]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=The creation of the Delta – Axios Delta National Park |url=https://axiosdelta.gr/en/national-park/protected-area/delta-creation/ |access-date=2024-08-22 |website=axiosdelta.gr}}</ref> [[Lake Koroneia|Koroneia]], [[Lake Volvi|Volvi]], [[Doiran Lake|Doiran]] and [[Lake Kerkini|Kerkini]] lakes are situated in Central Macedonia. The coasts are continuous, smooth, sandy and suitable for swimming  (except the estuaries and the shores of the urban complex of Thessaloniki).

==Administration==
The region was established in the 1987 administrative reform as the '''Central Macedonia Region''' ({{langx|el|Περιφέρεια Κεντρικής Μακεδονίας|Periféria Kentrikís Makedonías}}). With the 2010 [[Kallikratis plan]], its powers and authority were redefined and extended. Along with [[Eastern Macedonia and Thrace]], it is supervised by the [[Decentralized Administration of Macedonia and Thrace]], based in [[Thessaloniki]]. The region is based at its capital city of [[Thessaloniki]] and is divided into seven [[regional units of Greece|regional units]] (pre-Kallikratis [[prefectures of Greece|prefectures]]), [[Chalkidiki]], [[Imathia]], [[Kilkis (regional unit)|Kilkis]], [[Pella (regional unit)|Pella]], [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]], [[Serres (regional unit)|Serres]] and [[Thessaloniki (regional unit)|Thessaloniki]]. These are further subdivided into 38 [[Municipalities and communities of Greece|municipalities]].

Although  geographically part of Central Macedonia, [[Mount Athos]] is not administratively part of the region, but an autonomous self-governing state under the sovereignty of Greece.

==Demographics==
The region has shrunk by 90,039 people between [[2011 Greek census|2011]] and [[2021 Greek census|2021]], experiencing a population loss of 4.8%.<ref name="2021census"/><ref>{{Cite web |title=Σε 10.432.481 υπολογίζεται ο πληθυσμός της Ελλάδας - Είμαστε 383.805 λιγότεροι σε σχέση με το 2011 (βίντεο) |url=https://www.makthes.gr/se-10-432-481-ypologizetai-o-plithysmos-tis-elladas-eimaste-40-000-ligoteroi-se-schesi-me-to-2011-595230 |access-date=2023-07-14 |website=[[Makedonia (newspaper)|Macedonia Newspaper]] |language=el}}</ref>

==History==
{{Further|Macedonia (Greece)#History}}

The [[Administrative regions of Greece|modern Greek region]] of Central Macedonia roughly corresponds to the [[Regions of ancient Greece|ancient Greek region]] of [[Lower Macedonia]], which included the center and two capitals, [[Vergina|Aigai (Vergina)]] and [[Pella]], of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|ancient Macedonia]]. [[Pella]] was the birthplace of [[Alexander the Great]].

==Economy==
In 2011, the [[GDP per capita]] of Central Macedonia was {{currency|14400|EUR}}, marking a 9th place of the 13 regions of Greece, well below the national average of {{currency|18500|EUR}}.<ref name=EurostatGDP>{{cite web |url=http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=nama_r_e2gdp&lang=en |title=Gross domestic product (GDP) at current market prices at NUTS level 2 |work=Eurostat regional yearbook |publisher=[[Eurostat]] |access-date=3 April 2015}}</ref> 

==Tourism==
Central Macedonia is Greece's {{nowrap|fourth-most-popular}} tourist region and the most popular destination that is not an [[island]].<ref name="Fig 2018">{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gr/documents/20181/1515741/GreeceInFigures_2018Q4_EN.pdf/e64eb95a-766b-4540-847b-43dd555b5aa4 |publisher=[[Hellenic Statistical Authority]] |title=Greece in Figures 2018}}</ref> The [[Chalkidiki]] peninsula is [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]]'s most popular beach destination, combining {{convert|550|km|mi}} of sandy beaches with dense forests.<ref name="discover greece">{{cite web |url=https://www.discovergreece.com:443/en/mainland/macedonia |title=Macedonia: a region of a thousand landscapes |website=[[Discover Greece]] |language=en |access-date=2019-02-09}}</ref> There were 116 [[Blue Flag beach]]es in Macedonia in 2018, 85 of which were in Chalkidiki.<ref name="blue flags">{{cite web |url=https://eepf.gr/el/blueflag-2018-awards |title=Γαλάζιες Σημαίες 2018 |publisher=www.eepf.gr |trans-title=Blue Flags 2018 |access-date=2019-02-10}}</ref> Chalkidiki is also home to Mount Athos, which is an important center of religious tourism. [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]] combines extensive plains, high mountains and sandy beaches and the region's beauty gives it a great potential for further tourist development. It is estimated that 10,000 people climb [[Mount Olympus]] each year, most of them reaching only the Skolio summit. Most climbs of Mount Olympus start from the town of [[Litochoro]], which took the name City of Gods because of its location at the foot of the mountain. Central Macedonia is home to the ancient city of [[Aegae (Macedonia)|Aigai]] (modern day [[Vergina]]), one of [[List of World Heritage Sites in Greece|Greece's 18 UNESCO World Heritage sites]], which was the first capital of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon]]. In 336 BC [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] was assassinated in Aigai's theatre and his son, [[Alexander the Great]], was proclaimed king. The most important recent finds were made in 1977 when the burial sites of several kings of Macedon were found, including the tomb of [[Philip II of Macedon]]. It is also the site of an extensive royal palace. [[Museum of the Royal Tombs of Aigai (Vergina)|The archaeological museum of Vergina]] was built to house all the artifacts found at the site and is one of the most important museums in Greece. [[Pella]], which replaced Aigai as the capital of Macedon in the fourth century BC, is also located in Central Macedonia, as well as [[Dion, Pieria|Dion]] in [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]] and [[Amphipolis]]. These are important destinations for [[cultural tourism]]. [[Thessaloniki]] is home to numerous notable [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine monuments]], including the [[Paleochristian and Byzantine monuments of Thessaloniki]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], as well as several [[Roman Empire|Roman]], Ottoman and [[Sephardic Jewish]] structures. Apart from being the cultural center of Macedonia, [[Thessaloniki]] is also a hub for urban tourism and [[gastronomy]].<ref name="lonely planet">{{cite web |url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/greece/macedonia |title=Macedonia travel {{endash}} Greece |publisher=[[Lonely Planet]] |language=en |access-date=2019-02-09}}</ref>
