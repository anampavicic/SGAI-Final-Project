==History==
The area of Karatsu was part of ancient [[Hizen Province]].   In 1591, on the coast of the northern part of the city (formerly the town of Chinzei), [[Nagoya Castle (Hizen Province)|Nagoya Castle]] was constructed. The following year, it became the location from which the [[Imjin War]] was launched by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. In the middle of 1593, [[Terazawa Hirotaka]] created [[Karatsu Domain]]. In 1602, replacing Nagoya Castle, [[Karatsu Castle]] was constructed in what is now the heart of Karatsu.

Following the [[Meiji restoration]], the town of Karatsu and the villages of Hamasaki, Irino, Kagami, Karatsu, Kirigo, Kitahata, Kuri, Kyūragi, Minato, Mitsushima, Nagoya, Nanayama, Ōchi, Ōmura, Onizuka, Sashi, Uchiage and Yobuko were established with the creation of the modern municipalities system. Ōmura was renamed Tamashima in July 28, 1896. Hamasaki was elevated to town status on July 1, 1922. Karatsu annexed Mitsushima on January 1, 1924. Yobuko was elevated to town status on August 1, 1928. Karatsu Village was incorporated into Karatsu Town on January 1, 1932, and on September 1, 1935 both Sashi and Ōchi were elevated to town status. Sashi was subsequently annexed by Karatsu on November 11, 1941. Kyūragi was elevated to town status on May 3, 1952. On November 1, 1954 Karatsu annexed Kagami, Kuri, Minato and Onizuka.  Hamasaki and Tamashima were merged to create the town of Hamasaki-Tamashima; and Nagoya and Uchiage were merge to create the town of Chinzei on September 30, 1956. On November 1, 1958 Kirigo was split and its parts were incorporated into Karatsu and Irino (respectively), and Irino was elevated to town status and was renamed Hizen. On November 1, 1966 Hamasaki-Tamashima was renamed Hamatama.

On January 1, 2005, the towns of [[Chinzei, Saga|Chinzei]], [[Hamatama, Saga|Hamatama]], [[Hizen, Saga|Hizen]], [[Kyūragi, Saga|Kyūragi]], [[Ōchi, Saga|Ōchi]], [[Yobuko, Saga|Yobuko]] and the village of [[Kitahata, Saga|Kitahata]] (all from [[Higashimatsuura District, Saga|Higashimatsuura District]]) were merged into Karatsu.
