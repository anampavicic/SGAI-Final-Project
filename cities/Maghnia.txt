'''Maghnia''' ({{Langx|ar|مغنية}}) (formerly '''Marnia''') is a town in [[Tlemcen Province]], northwestern [[Algeria]]. It is the second most populated town in Tlemcen Province, after [[Tlemcen]]. The current population is over 200,000.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==History==
[[Archaeologists]] have found evidence of prehistoric people in the area, who were displaced by the [[Phoenicians]]. The remnants of burned [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] military posts called '''''Numerus Syrorum''''' were discovered by the [[France|French]] army in 1836, when they entered the area; these posts were occupied, according to the inscriptions, by the ''numerus Severianus Alexandrinus Syrorum'',<ref>{{cite web |last1=Huß |first1=Werner |title=Numerus Syrorum |url=https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/numerus-syrorum-e826480 |website=Brill's New Pauly |access-date=Aug 5, 2020}}</ref> a unit of [[Syria]]n [[Archery|archers]]. As such, it was the westernmost outpost of [[Mauretania Caesariensis]].

Due to its convenient geographical location—within the [[drainage basin|watershed]] of [[Wadi]] [[Tafna]] on the route to [[Fes]] from [[Tlemcen]], Maghnia later served as a [[marketplace]] for regional [[nomad]]s.

The [[Berbers]] named the place '''Lalla Marnia''' ('''Lalla Maghnia'''), after a local saint buried in the vicinity. Her [[mausoleum]] was probably built in the 18th century.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Maghnia {{!}} Berber Town, Oued Soummam, Tlemcen {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Maghnia |access-date=2024-10-20 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref>
