'''Olinda''' ({{IPA|pt|ɔˈlĩdɐ}}) is a historic city in [[Pernambuco]], Brazil, in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Region]]. It is located on the country's northeastern [[Atlantic Ocean]] coast, in the [[Recife metropolitan area|Metropolitan Region]] of [[Recife]], the state capital.<ref name="b"/> It has a population of 349.976 people, covers {{convert|41.681|km2|mi2}}, and has a population density of {{Convert|9437|PD/km2|PD/sqmi}}. It is noted as one of the best-preserved colonial cities in Brazil<ref name="ibge2016"/> and has been inhabited since 1535.

As the former capital of the [[Captaincy of Pernambuco]] during the [[Colonial Brazil|colonial era]], Olinda has many historical buildings—the center was declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 1982—and a rich culture. The [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnaval]] of Olinda, a popular street party, is very similar to traditional Portuguese carnivals, with the addition of African influenced dances, reflecting the history of the Northeast. All the festivities are celebrated on the streets with no bleachers or roping, and, unlike in other cities, admission is free. There are hundreds of small musical groups (sometimes featuring a single performer) in many genres.

Several indigenous tribes occupied the coast of Northeastern Brazil for several thousand years, and the hills of the present day municipality of Olinda had settlements of [[Caeté people|Caetés]] and [[Tupinambá people|Tupinambá]] tribes, which were frequently at war. French mercenaries are thought to be the first Europeans to reach the region, but the Portuguese exploited intertribal rivalries and managed to build a stronghold on the former Caeté village on a high hill. Recent studies by the [[Federal University of Pernambuco]] have uncovered new evidence of the pre-colonial population of the area.

The settlement of Olinda was founded in 1535 by [[Duarte Coelho Pereira]], from Portugal; it was elevated to a town on March 12, 1537.<ref name="b" /> It was made the seat of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Territorial Prelature of Pernambuco]] in 1614, becoming the Diocese of Olinda in 1676. The economy of the region was dominated by the production of [[sugarcane]]. This, combined with the importing of [[Slavery in Brazil|slaves]] from Africa to support cultivation made Olinda a colonial stronghold.

Olinda was the capital of the Portuguese hereditary [[captaincy of Pernambuco]], but was burned by Dutch invaders. The Portuguese built their town on the hill, for practical purposes (eg, sewers) and to make it easier to defend. In the 17th century the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] was united with Spain (the 1580-1640 [[Iberian Union]]). Taking advantage of this period of Portuguese weakness, the area around Olinda and [[Recife]] was occupied by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] who gained access to the Portuguese [[sugarcane]] plantations.<ref name="ibge2016" /> [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen]] was appointed as the governor of the Dutch possessions in Brazil in 1637 by the Dutch West India Company on recommendation of Frederick Henry. He landed at [[Recife]], the [[Recife port|port]] of Pernambuco and the chief stronghold of the Dutch, in January 1637. By a series of successful expeditions, he gradually extended the Dutch possessions from Sergipe on the south to [[São Luís, Maranhão|São Luís de Maranhão]] in the north. He likewise conquered the Portuguese possessions of Saint George del Mina, Saint Thomas, and [[Luanda]], [[Angola]], on the west coast of Africa. After the dissolution of the [[Iberian Union]] in 1640, Portugal would reestablish its authority over the lost territories of the [[Portuguese Empire]], including the former Dutch Brazil. Sugarcane plantation slavery would continue to be a source of wealth in Olinda until the [[Lei Áurea]] ("Golden Law") abolished slavery in an [[Independence of Brazil|independent Brazil]] in 1888.

Olinda declined in importance after the Dutch invasion. Recife became the capital of Pernambuco in 1827, and Olinda is part of the greater [[Recife metropolitan area]]. Due to the historic position of the city, its cathedral, a [[World Heritage Site]], called São Salvador do Mundo, remains the primary seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Olinda e Recife|Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Olinda and Recife]],<ref name="b" /> with a [[co-cathedral]] in Recife. Olinda also has a [[Minor Basilica]], again a World Heritage Site (Minor): Basílica Abacial do Mosteiro de São Bento de Olinda.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/olin0.htm|title=Archdiocese of Olinda e Recife, Brazil}}</ref>

Besides its natural beauty, Olinda is also one of Brazil's main cultural centers: in 1982 it was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]]. The city relives the magnificence of the past every year during the large [[Carnival]], to the rhythms of ''[[frevo]]'', ''[[maracatu]]'' and other northeast music and dances.

== Geography ==
Olinda is located on the coast of the state of [[Pernambuco]], six kilometers north of the center of [[Recife]]. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the municipality of [[Paulista]] to the north, and Recife to the south and west. It is part of the [[Recife metropolitan area|Metropolitan Region of Recife]] (RMR). 

The average elevation is 16 m above sea level. The landscapes is made of plains and hills, some of them steep. Olinda is mostly drained by the [[Paratibe River]] (55.13% of the territory), with the remainder drained by the [[Capibaribe River]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=OLINDA|first=SECOM-SECRETARIA DE COMUNICAÇÃO DE|title=Olinda em Dados|url=https://www.olinda.pe.gov.br/a-cidade/olinda-em-dados/|access-date=2021-04-17|website=Prefeitura de Olinda, Mais Conquistas para Todos|language=pt-br}}</ref> The municipality is in the [[Atlantic Forest]] ecoregion.

Olinda has a [[Tropical monsoon climate|tropical monsoon]] type climate ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen-Geiger]]: [[Tropical monsoon climate|Am]]'')'', typical of the eastern section of the northeastern Brazilian coast, with average monthly temperatures consistently above 18 °C, little [[Diurnal temperature variation|diurnal variation]] in temperature, abundant rainfall most of the year, and high [[Humidity|relative humidity]].<ref>{{Cite web|title="OS MORROS DA REGIÃO METROPOLITANA DO RECIFE"|url=http://www2.condepefidem.pe.gov.br/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=98ef7a5b-d679-42b6-87e6-5942ff8744b6&groupId=19941|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402161140/http://www2.condepefidem.pe.gov.br/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=98ef7a5b-d679-42b6-87e6-5942ff8744b6&groupId=19941|archive-date=2015-04-02|access-date=2014-05-01|website=Agência Estadual de Planejamento e Pesquisas de Pernambuco (CONDEPE/FIDEM)}}</ref>
