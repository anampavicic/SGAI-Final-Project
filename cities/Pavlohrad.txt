== History ==
Pavlohrad, one of the oldest modern settlements in the Dnipropetrovsk oblast appears in documents from the 17th century.

At the beginning of the 1770s, [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Zaporozhian Cossack]] Matvii Khizhnyak built winter quarters, which soon became known as [[sloboda (settlement)|sloboda]] Matviivka ({{Langx|uk|Матвіївка}}; {{langx |ru| Матвеевка | translit = Matveevka}}). In 1779, Matviivka was renamed to Luhanske, as the latter became headquarters of the Luhansk [[pikemen]] regiment headed by [[Mikhail Kutuzov |M. I. Golinishchev-Kutuzov]]. With the establishment of [[Yekaterinoslav Viceroyalty]] in 1783, Pavlohrad, re-named in honor of the future Emperor [[Paul I of Russia |Paul І]] ({{reign | 1796 | 1801}}), became a part of this administrative unit as a [[district]] town. In 1784, Pavlohrad received city status.

There were 426 homes and 2419 inhabitants in the city at the end of 18th century. The citizens of Pavlohrad lived in [[wattle and daub]] huts. The first stone building was the Holy Ascension Cathedral on Soborna Square. The first [[coat of arms]] of the city was affirmed on 29 July 1811, the second one on 26 September 1979. The first citizens were [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Cossacks]] of {{Ill|Samara Palanka|lt=Samara|uk|Самарська паланка}} and {{Ill|Kalmius Palanka|lt=Kalmius|uk|Кальміуська паланка}} [[Zaporozhian Cossacks#Organization |Palankas]] and [[Demobilized |demobilized military]]. The city plan by Scottish architect [[William Heste |W. Geste]] was affirmed by emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] on 31 July 1831.

In 1871, local merchant A.K. Shalin was elected the first head of the city. The central street was named after him (Shalinska Street), later renamed [[Vladimir Lenin|Leninska]] Street. In 2015, the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] government approved [[Ukrainian decommunization laws|laws]] that outlawed [[Communist symbolism|communist symbols]] and street names.<ref>{{cite journal|url= https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2015-04-28/kievs-purge |title= Decommunizing Ukraine |first= Alexander J. | last= Motyl | author-link= Alexander J.

Permanin was elected as [[Governor |city governor]] in 1892. Under his [[leadership]] the city started to develop rapidly: several churches, temples, barracks, gymnasiums, factories and plants were built.

In the 1870s, a railway connecting [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Simferopol]] passed through Pavlohrad. In 1896, the Golenishchev-Kutuzov family built the "Earl's Theatre".{{cn|date=April 2023}}

In 1930, an uprising against [[Soviet]] rule took place in Pavlohrad.{{cn|date=May 2022}} From 1780 to 1941, a significant [[Jewish]] community existed in the city. The pre-[[Holocaust]] Jewish population was approximately 4,000. The city was destroyed in 1941 during the [[Nazi]] occupation. During [[the Holocaust]] the German occupying forces operated a concentration camp (Dulag 111) and a Jewish ghetto in Pavlohrad. A large part of the community died during the war and during the mass executions. The Pavlohrad Jewish cemetery contains not only Jewish, but also Christian burials, which the leaders of the local Jewish community agreed to in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|title= PAVLOHRAD JEWISH CEMETERY|url= http://admin.lo-tishkach.org/Search/Search/ShowQryCemeteryTownPage.aspx?QryCemeteryAndTown=11983|publisher= [[Lo Tishrash]]|access-date= 30 September 2012|archive-date= 14 July 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140714234155/http://admin.lo-tishkach.org/Search/Search/ShowQryCemeteryTownPage.aspx?QryCemeteryAndTown=11983|url-status= dead}}</ref> On 22 May 2011 it was reported that unknown persons had desecrated the cemetery in the town - tombstones were turned over and broken in an apparently anti-Semitic act.<ref>

Following the German retreat in February 1943, the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' recaptured Pavlohrad during a counteroffensive, planning to use the city as a base for a future attacks on the entire southern Red Army.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Harvest of Despair|author= Karel C. Berkhoff|publisher=Harvard University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nd9WzIkTJrAC|access-date=2024-09-05|date=2009-07-01|page=300|isbn=9780674020788}}</ref> This period was marked by the persecution of civilians, including arrests, executions, and forced labour.

Until 18 July 2020, Pavlohrad was incorporated as a [[city of regional significance (Ukraine) |city of oblast significance]] and served as the administrative center of Pavlohrad Raion though it did not belong to the raion. In July 2020, as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast to seven, the city of Pavlohrad was merged into Pavlohrad Raion.<ref>{{Cite news|title= Про утворення та ліквідацію районів.

During the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]], Pavlohrad — an important railway transportation hub — was subjected to Russian attacks. On 22 March, a missile strike destroyed the Pavlohrad-2 train station in the city, killing at least one person.<ref>{{cite news |title= At least 1 killed as Russian missile attack destroys Ukrainian train station, official says |url= https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-22-22/h_d59db12bc9bb387c9ab42c596ef6fc7b |access-date= 22 March 2022 |agency= CNN |date= 22 March 2022 |language= en}}</ref>

==Industry==
The city is home to [[Pavlohrad Mechanical Plant]] (PMZ) that was established in December 1963 as a specialized production facility of the Plant no. 586 (now [[Yuzhmash|Pivdenmash]] Production Association). PMZ is a factory dedicated to assembly, perfection and production of solid-fueled rocket engines and missiles. By 1975 PMZ became the largest solid-rocket factory within the Ministry of General Machine Building of [[USSR]]. PMZ made fuel tanks for booster rockets and plastic ICBM rocket motor casings; parts, components, and assemblies for aerospace systems manufacturing.{{cn|date=April 2023}}

On 30 April 2023, a Russian attack on Pavlohrad caused a series of large explosions and fires, injuring at least 34 civilians. Ukrainian sources reported that a plant was hit that produced solid fuel for Soviet-era rockets, and had a number of motors awaiting decommissioning.
Russian sources claimed that this attack disrupted the production of ammunition, weapons and military equipment for Ukrainian troops.<ref>{{Cite news |last= |first= |last2= |first2= |last3= |first3= |date=2023-05-01 |title=Ukraine ammunition depot reportedly hit in wave of Russian missile attacks |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/01/ukraine-ammunition-depot-reportedly-hit-in-wave-of-russian-missile-attacks |access-date=2023-05-24 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>
