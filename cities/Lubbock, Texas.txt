[[File:Texas - Lubbock - NARA - 68149542 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Lubbock in 1928]]
In 1867, the land that would become Lubbock was the heart of [[Comancheria]], the shifting domain controlled by the [[Comanche]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Comanche Empire |last=Hamalainnen |first=Pekka |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2009 |location=New Haven |pages=316}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Holmes |first=Mikayla |date=2023-10-09 |title=Lubbock once territory for Indigenous tribes, non-profit says |url=https://www.everythinglubbock.com/news/local-news/lubbock-once-territory-for-indigenous-tribes-non-profit-says/ |access-date=2023-10-09 |website=KLBK {{!}} KAMC {{!}} EverythingLubbock.com |language=en-US}}</ref> [[File:Lubbock April 2022 48 (First Baptist Church).jpg|thumb|Lubbock has a large number of churches, including the downtown First [[Baptist]] congregation.]]

Lubbock County was founded in 1876. It was named after [[Thomas Saltus Lubbock]], former Texas Ranger and brother of [[Francis Lubbock]], governor of Texas during the Civil War.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdl04 |title=Handbook of Texas Online |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |access-date=February 17, 2020 |archive-date=August 3, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803172426/https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdl04 |url-status=live }}</ref> As early as 1884, a [[United States Post Office Department|U.S. post office]] existed in [[Yellow House Canyon]]. A small town, known as Old Lubbock, Lubbock, or North Town, was established about three miles to the east. In 1890, the original Lubbock merged with Monterey, another small town south of the canyon. The new town adopted the Lubbock name. The merger included moving the original Lubbock's Nicolett Hotel across the canyon on rollers to the new townsite. Lubbock became the county seat in 1891,<ref>Paul H. Carlson, "The Nicolett Hotel and the Founding of Lubbock", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 90 (2014), pp. 8–9, 11.</ref> and was incorporated on March 16, 1909. In the same year, the first railroad train arrived.

Texas Technological College (now Texas Tech University) was founded in Lubbock in 1923. A separate university, [[Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center]], opened as Texas Tech University School of Medicine in 1969. Both universities are now overseen by the [[Texas Tech University System]], after it was established in 1996 and based in Lubbock. [[Lubbock Christian University]], founded in 1957,  affiliated with the [[Churches of Christ]], has its main campus in the city. [[South Plains College]] and [[Wayland Baptist University]] operate branch campuses in Lubbock.

At one time, Lubbock was home to [[Reese Air Force Base]], located {{convert|6|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} west of the city. It was established in August 1941, during the defense build-up prior to [[World War II]] (1941–1945), by the [[United States Department of War]] and the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] as Lubbock Army Airfield. It served the old [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]], and later the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] (USAF), after reorganization and establishment in 1947. The USAF base's primary mission throughout its existence was pilot training. The base was closed 30 September 1997, after being selected for closure by the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] Commission in 1995, and is now a research and business park called [[Reese Technology Center]].

The city is home to the [[Lubbock Lake Landmark]], part of the [[Museum of Texas Tech University]]. The landmark is an archaeological and natural-history preserve at the northern edge of the city. It shows evidence of almost 12,000 years of human occupation in the region. The [[National Ranching Heritage Center]], also part of the Museum of Texas Tech University, houses historic ranch-related structures from the region.

During World War II, airmen cadets from the Royal Air Force, flying from their training base at Terrell, Texas, routinely flew to Lubbock on training flights. The town served as a stand-in for the British for Cork, Ireland, which was the same distance from London, England, as Lubbock is from Terrell.

In August 1951, a V-shaped formation of lights was seen over the city. The "[[Lubbock Lights]]" series of sightings received national publicity and is regarded as one of the first great "[[UFO]]" cases. The sightings were considered credible because they were witnessed by several respected science professors at Texas Technological College and were photographed by a Texas Tech student. The photographs were reprinted nationwide in newspapers and in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''. [[Project Blue Book]], the USAF's official investigation of the UFO mystery, concluded the photographs were not a hoax and showed genuine objects, but dismissed the UFOs as being either "night-flying moths" or a type of bird called a [[plover]] reflected in the nighttime glow of Lubbock's new street lights.

In 1960, the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] reported Lubbock's population as 128,691 and area as {{convert|75.0|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref name="census"/>

On May 11, 1970, the [[Lubbock Tornado]] struck the city. Twenty-six people died, and damage was estimated at $125&nbsp;million. The [[Metro Tower (Lubbock)|Metro Tower]] (NTS Building), then known as the Great Plains Life Building, at {{convert|274|ft|m|abbr=on}} in height, is believed to have been the tallest building ever to survive a direct hit from an [[Fujita scale|F5]] tornado.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lub/climate/Local_interest_events/LUB_tornado/lubtor.html |title=Lubbock, Texas |publisher=[[National Weather Service]] Forecast Office |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061009180854/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lub/climate/Local_interest_events/LUB_tornado/lubtor.html |archive-date = October 9, 2006}}</ref>

During the late 1970s to mid-1980s, [[Texas Instruments]] was a major Lubbock employer, manufacturing consumer electronics – including early calculators, digital watches, and [[TI-99/4|TI-99 series]] home computers. In the early 1980s, shipping up to 5,000 computers a day from the Lubbock factory, TI briefly dominated the U.S. home computer market.<ref name="death_1984_04_texasmonthly">[https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/death-of-texas-instruments-home-computer/ "Death of a Computer,"] April 1984, ''[[Texas Monthly]],'' retrieved September 20, 2023</ref>

In August, 1988, tens of thousands of people came to Lubbock, drawn by an [[1988 Lubbock apparition of Mary|apparition of Mary]].

On August 12, 2008, the Lubbock Chamber of Commerce announced they would lead the effort to get enough signatures to have a vote on allowing county-wide packaged alcohol sales.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chamber to Lead Alcohol Petition Effort |url=http://www.myfoxlubbock.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail?contentId=7191012&version=2&locale=EN-US&layoutCode=TSTY&pageId=1.1.1&sflg=1 |publisher=My Fox Lubbock |access-date=2009-05-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714142817/http://www.myfoxlubbock.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail?contentId=7191012&version=2&locale=EN-US&layoutCode=TSTY&pageId=1.1.1&sflg=1 |archive-date=July 14, 2011}}</ref> The petition effort was successful and the question was put to the voters.

Lubbock is home to numerous parks, scattered throughout the city. Most parks feature a small lake and attract waterfowl of various species. One of Lubbock's larger lakes, Dunbar Historic Lake, lies in Dunbar Historic Lake Park, near Mackenzie Park. Drainage exits into the North Fork Double Mountain Fork Brazos River. The park features miles of hiking trails and the [[Crosbyton-Southplains Railroad]] trestle, built in 1911, which spans the North Fork Double Mountain Fork Brazos River at the park's southeast end. This trestle has become known by many locals as "Hell's Gate" or "[[Hell's Gate Trestle]]" for its supposed paranormal activity.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-04-09 |title=Hell's Gates: A Haunted Texas Railroad Trestle Near Buddy Holly's Grave |url=https://texashillcountry.com/hells-gates-haunted-railroad-trestle/ |access-date=2021-12-23 |website=Texas Hill Country |language=en-US |archive-date=December 23, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211223154831/https://texashillcountry.com/hells-gates-haunted-railroad-trestle/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Many parks in Lubbock are home to a series of Playa Lakes. Often small in size, the lakes serve as reservoirs for stormwater and irrigation runoff, and are an important part of the West Texas High Plains ecosystem.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Playa Lakes |url=https://tpwd.texas.gov/landwater/land/habitats/high_plains/wetlands/playa.phtml |access-date=2021-12-30 |website=tpwd.texas.gov |archive-date=December 30, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211230141856/https://tpwd.texas.gov/landwater/land/habitats/high_plains/wetlands/playa.phtml |url-status=live }}</ref> Playa lakes generally drain from one to another over land during a rainfall event, but many were connected as part of an underground drainage project in the early 2000s to avoid flooding.

===Transportation===

====Highways====
[[File:Marsha Sharp Freeway Light Trails.jpg|thumb|[[US 82]], locally known as the Marsha Sharp Freeway]]
Lubbock is served by major highways. [[Interstate 27 (Texas)|Interstate 27]] (the former Avenue H) links the city to [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]] and [[Interstate 40 (Texas)|Interstate 40]], a transcontinental route. I-27 was completed through the city in 1992 (it originally terminated just north of downtown). Other major highways include [[U.S. Highway 62 (Texas)|US 62]] and [[U.S. Highway 82 in Texas|US 82]], which run concurrently (except for 4th Street via US 82 and 19th Street via US 62) through the city east–west as the Marsha Sharp Freeway, 19th Street (US 62 only), 4th Street/Parkway Drive (US 82 only) and [[Idalou, Texas|Idalou]] Highway. [[U.S. Highway 84 (Texas)|US 84]] (Avenue Q/[[Slaton, Texas|Slaton]] Highway/[[Clovis, New Mexico|Clovis]] Road) is also another east–west route running northwest–southeast diagonally. [[U.S. Highway 87 (Texas)|US Highway 87]] runs between [[San Angelo, Texas|San Angelo]] and Amarillo and follows I-27 concurrently. [[Texas State Highway 114|State Highway 114]] runs east–west, following US 62/82 on the east before going its own way. Lubbock is circled by [[State Highway Loop 289 (Texas)|Loop 289]], which suffers from traffic congestion despite being a potential bypass around the city, which is the reason behind I-27 and Brownfield Highway being built through the city to have freeway traffic flow effectively inside the loop.

The city is set up on a simple [[grid plan]]. In the heart of the city, numbered streets run east–west and lettered avenues run north–south – the grid begins at Avenue A in the east and First Street in the north. North of First Street, city planners chose to name streets alphabetically from the south to the north after colleges and universities. The north–south avenues run from A to Y. What would be Avenue Z is actually University Avenue, since it runs along the east side of Texas Tech. Beyond that, the A-to-Z convention resumes, using US cities found east of the [[Mississippi River]] (e.g. Akron Avenue, Boston Avenue, Canton Avenue). Again, the Z name is not used, with Slide Road appearing in its place.

====Rail service====
Lubbock currently does not provide [[intercity rail]] service, although various proposals have been presented over the years to remedy this. One, the ''[[Caprock Chief]]'', would have seen daily service as part of a [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], Texas—[[Denver]], Colorado service, but it failed to gain interest.<ref>{{cite news |title=Lubbock officials backing plans for Amtrak rail service |url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/080201/tex_amtrakrail.shtml |date=August 2, 2001 |work=[[Amarillo Globe-News]] |access-date=2008-05-14 |first=Chris |last=Van Wagenen |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604000244/http://amarillo.com/stories/080201/tex_amtrakrail.shtml |archive-date=June 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Lubbock is served by the BNSF Railway company, Plainsman Switching Company (PSC), and [[West Texas and Lubbock Railway|West Texas & Lubbock Railway]] (WTLC). PSC interchanges with BNSF (also with UP through a UP-BNSF Haulage agreement) in Lubbock and has 19 miles of track within city limits of Lubbock with 36 customers. Options exist for transloading a variety of materials on the line, from wind-turbine parts to steel shafts. PSC handles many commodities such as cottonseed, cottonseed oil, cottonseed meal, cottonseed hulls, milo, corn, wheat, pinto beans, sand, rock, lumber, nonperishable food items, chemicals, paper products, brick, and bagging material, and can also store cars. WTLC interchanges with BNSF (also with UP through a UP-BNSF Haulage agreement) in Lubbock. WTLC has a yard on the west side of Lubbock, where they switch cars to go down their line to Levelland or to Brownfield. WTLC handles commodities of grains, chemicals, sands, peanuts, lumber, etc.

====Airports====
{{See also|Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport}}
[[File:Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport IMG 0260.JPG|thumb|right|[[Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport]]]]
The city's air services are provided by [[Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport]], which is named for the Lubbock businessman who became [[lieutenant governor]] and governor of Texas. It is on the city's northeast side. The airport is the eighth-busiest airport in Texas. Lubbock Preston Smith Airport also plays host as a major hub to FedEx's feeder planes that serve cities around Lubbock.

====Intercity bus service====
[[Greyhound Lines]] operates the Lubbock Station at 801 Broadway, just east of the [[Lubbock County Courthouse]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greyhound.com/home/TicketCenter/en/terminal.asp?city=681791 |title=Greyhound |publisher=Greyhound |access-date=2015-07-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122230451/https://www.greyhound.com/home/TicketCenter/en/terminal.asp?city=681791 |archive-date=November 22, 2008 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

====Public transportation====
{{See also|Citibus (Lubbock)}}
Public transportation is provided by [[Citibus (Lubbock)|Citibus]], a bus transit system running Monday through Saturday every week with a transit center hub in downtown. It runs bus routes throughout the city, with the main routes converging at the Downtown Transfer Plaza, which also houses the Greyhound bus terminal. Citibus has been in continual service since 1971, when the city of Lubbock took over public transit operations. The paratransit system is called Citiaccess.

Citibus' six [[diesel-electric hybrid bus]]es have begun service on city routes. Managers hope the buses will use 60% of the fuel their older, larger versions consume in moving customers across the city. The buses seat 23 passengers, can support full-sized [[wheelchair]]s, and will run on all but two city-based routes.

====Modal characteristics====
According to the 2016 American Community Survey, 80.9% of working Lubbock (city) residents commuted by driving alone, 12.9% carpooled, 1% used public transportation, and 1.5% walked. About 1.5% used all other forms of transportation, including taxi, bicycle, and motorcycle. About 2.3% worked at home.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Census Reporter |title=Means of Transportation to Work by Age |access-date=May 7, 2018 |url=https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B08101&geo_ids=16000US4845000&primary_geo_id=16000US4845000 |archive-date=May 8, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508054041/https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B08101&geo_ids=16000US4845000&primary_geo_id=16000US4845000 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2015, 7.3% of Lubbock households were without a car, which decreased to 5.6% in 2016. The national average was 8.7% in 2016. Lubbock averaged 1.74 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8 per household.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Car Ownership in U.S. Cities Data and Map |journal=Governing |date=December 9, 2014 |url=http://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html |access-date=May 7, 2018 |archive-date=May 11, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511162014/http://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Milwaukee Avenue====
In the early years of the 21st century, Lubbock turned its Milwaukee Avenue into a major thoroughfare. Previously, Milwaukee was a 4-mile dirt road on farm land with hardly any traffic a mile or more from major development. With growth headed westward, the city allocated nearly $20&nbsp;million to convert the road into a seven-lane concrete thoroughfare. In 2004, the city funded the project and other developments to come by establishing a new fund that tapped part of the franchise fees received. As of 2018, more than $124&nbsp;million in street construction has been possible from the fund, including Slide Road, 98th Street, Indiana Avenue, and the last phases of the [[U.S. Route 82 in Texas|Marsha Sharp Freeway]]. Public Works Director Wood Franklin said Milwaukee Avenue was conceived on the "build it and they will come" theory. Marc McDougal, then the mayor of Lubbock, described the project as a well calculated risk that subsequently greatly benefited the city.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.lubbockonline.com/news/20180728/leaders-say-lubbocks-milwaukee-avenue-took-creative-funding-project-of-similar-scope-not-foreseen |title=Leaders say Lubbock's Milwaukee Avenue took creative funding, project of similar scope not foreseen |author=Matt Dotray |date=July 28, 2018 |newspaper=Lubbock Avalanche-Journal |access-date=August 7, 2018 |archive-date=August 7, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807190016/http://www.lubbockonline.com/news/20180728/leaders-say-lubbocks-milwaukee-avenue-took-creative-funding-project-of-similar-scope-not-foreseen |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Lubbock Power and Light===
The majority of Lubbock is served by [[Lubbock Power and Light]], founded in 1916. After over 100 years of service, LP&L has decided to join the [[Electric Reliability Council of Texas]] and open the Lubbock market to competitive electricity providers. Their recent anticipated approval by the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC) has been approved as of September 28, 2023. LP&L is on track to be the first municipally owned utility to enter the competitive market in ERCOT on March 4, 2024.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lubbockonline.com/story/news/politics/government/2023/10/26/lpl-lubbocks-competitive-electric-shopping-window-to-open-jan-2024/71333556007/ |title=Competitive electric shopping window to open Jan. 2024 |website=lubbockonline.com |date=2023-10-26 |access-date=2024-02-18}}</ref>
