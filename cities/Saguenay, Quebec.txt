'''Saguenay''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|ɡ|ə|n|eɪ|,_|ˌ|s|æ|ɡ|ə|ˈ|n|eɪ}} {{respell|SAG|ə|nay|,_-|NAY}}, {{IPA|fr|saɡnɛ|lang}}, {{IPA|fr-CA|-ne|label=[[Quebec French|locally]]}}) is a city in the [[Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean]] region of [[Quebec]], Canada, on the [[Saguenay River]], about {{convert|200|km|mi|-1}} north of [[Quebec City]] by overland route. It is about {{convert|126|km|mi|}} upriver and northwest of [[Tadoussac]], located at the confluence with the [[St. Lawrence River]]. It was formed in 2002 by merging the cities of [[Chicoutimi]] and [[Jonquière]] and the town of [[La Baie, Quebec|La Baie]]. Chicoutimi was founded by French colonists in 1676. As of July 2021, the city had a population of 145,000 and the metropolitan area had a population of 165,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://statistique.quebec.ca/fr/document/population-et-structure-par-age-et-sexe-rmr-regions-metropolitaines-de-recensement/tableau/estimation-population-regions-metropolitaines-recensement-rmr-quebec |title=Estimation de la population des régions métropolitaines de recensement (RMR), Québec, 1ᵉʳ juillet 2001 à 2022 |language=fr-QC |publisher=Institut de la statistique du Québec |access-date=January 5, 2024}}</ref>

The city of Saguenay constitutes a [[territory equivalent to a regional county municipality]] (TE); its geographical code is 941. Together with the [[regional county municipality]] of [[Le Fjord-du-Saguenay Regional County Municipality|Le Fjord-du-Saguenay]], it forms the [[Census geographic units of Canada|census division]] (CD) of [[Le Saguenay-et-son-Fjord]] (94). The mayor of Saguenay since 2021 is [[Julie Dufour]]. Prior to its use as the name of the city, the term "the Saguenay" or (less commonly) "Saguenay Valley" had already been used for the whole Saguenay River region (see [[Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean]]).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Le Saguenay: Region in Transition|first=H.

The city is divided into three boroughs: [[Chicoutimi]] (which includes the former city of Chicoutimi, as well as Laterrière and Tremblay township), [[Jonquière]] (which includes the former city of Jonquière, Lac-Kénogami, and Shipshaw) and [[La Baie, Quebec|La Baie]] (which corresponds to the former city of La Baie).

The name Saguenay is possibly derived from the [[Innu]] word "Saki-nip", which means "where water flows out".<ref>{{cite web |title=La rivière et chemin du Royaume et terre du Saguenay |url=http://www.histoirequebec.qc.ca/publicat/vol5num1/v5n1_6ri.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025125908/http://www.histoirequebec.qc.ca/publicat/vol5num1/v5n1_6ri.htm |archive-date=October 25, 2007 |language=fr |website=histoirequebec.qc.ca }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Histoire du Saguenay depuis les origines jusqu'à 1870 |url=http://www.ourroots.ca/e/toc.aspx?id=4639 |website=Our Roots / Nos Racines |publisher=University of Calgary, Université Laval |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615040547/http://www.ourroots.ca/e/toc.aspx?id=4639 |archive-date=June 15, 2011 |language=fr}}</ref>

==History==
Saguenay was formed on February 18, 2002, by [[Municipal reorganization in Quebec|amalgamating]] the cities of [[Chicoutimi]], [[Jonquière]], [[La Baie, Quebec|La Baie]] and [[Laterrière, Quebec|Laterrière]], along with the municipalities of Lac-Kénogami and Shipshaw and part of the township of [[Tremblay, Quebec|Tremblay]].<ref name="stat.gouv.qc.ca">http://www.stat.gouv.qc.ca/publications/referenc/pdf/modfev02.pdf {{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Chicoutimi===
{{main|Chicoutimi}}
[[Image:Pulperie de Chicoutimi.jpg|thumb|left|Old Chicoutimi Pulp Mill was an early 20th-century industrial complex in operation from 1898 to 1930.]]
[[First Nations in Canada|First Nations people]], including [[Innus]] have inhabited the Saguenay Fjord area for thousands of years prior to the first Europeans arriving.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fqbOCwAAQBAJ&dq=saguenay+indigenous+people&pg=RA2-PT38 | title=Indigenous People and Economic Development: An International Perspective | isbn=978-1-317-11730-8 | last1=Iankova | first1=Katia | last2=Hassan | first2=Azizul | last3=l'Abbe | first3=Rachel | date=March 22, 2016 | publisher=Routledge }}</ref> What was ultimately to become the centre of the borough of Chicoutimi was first settled in 1676 as a [[France|French]] [[French colonization of the Americas|trading post]] in the [[fur trade]]. At that time, the Saguenay and [[Chicoutimi River|Chicoutimi]] rivers had been used for centuries by the [[Innu people|Innu]]. The name ''Chicoutimi'' means 'the end of the deepwater' in the Montagnais. Chicoutimi trading post was in operation until 1782.

The city of Chicoutimi was officially incorporated as a municipality in 1845 by Peter McLeod, a [[Métis]] timber contractor, who had built a sawmill there in 1842. It was designated in 1855 as the seat of Chicoutimi County and in 1878 as the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Chicoutimi]].

With the arrival of the [[Canadian National Railway]] in 1893, the local [[Pulp and paper industry|pulp and paper industries]] expanded, particularly in mechanical pulp production. The Chicoutimi Pulp Co. was founded in 1896 and backed by [[French-Canadian]] investors. By 1910 the Chicoutimi Pulp Mill became the biggest producer of mechanical pulp in Canada.

The economic decline of the [[Great Depression]] led the city's economy to shift administration and commerce and commercial. The [[Conservatoire de musique de Saguenay]] was founded in Chicoutimi in 1967, and the [[Université du Québec à Chicoutimi]] was founded in 1969. The city played host to the Quebec Summer Games in 1972.

In the municipal amalgamations of 1976, Chicoutimi annexed the neighbouring towns of Chicoutimi-Nord and Rivière-du-Moulin. In a later round of [[Municipal reorganization in Quebec|amalgamations in 2002]], the cities of Chicoutimi, [[Jonquière]], [[La Baie, Quebec|La Baie]], Lac-Kénogami, [[Laterrière, Quebec|Laterrière]], Shipshaw and part of [[Tremblay, Quebec|Tremblay]] merged to form the new city of Saguenay.<ref name="stat.gouv.qc.ca"/> Chicoutimi became a borough of Saguenay.

During the summer of 1996 a record rainfall in the region caused [[Saguenay Flood|major flooding]] in the downtown, as well as outlying areas. The total cost of the disaster was recorded to be C$1.5 billion. It claimed seven lives and destroyed many bridges.

===Jonquière===
{{main|Jonquière}}
[[File:Jonquiere MontJacob.jpg|thumbnail|left|A view of Jonquiere as seen from Mont Jacob]]
Jonquière was founded in 1847 by [[Marguerite Belley]], who came from [[La Malbaie, Quebec|La Malbaie]] to settle on the Rivière aux Sables. It was named after [[Jacques-Pierre de Taffanel de la Jonquière, Marquis de la Jonquière]], governor of New France from 1749 to 1752.

Growth came from the construction of pulp and paper mills at the beginning of the 20th century. Between 1925 and 1928, the world's largest aluminum plant was built along with the city Arvida (then a separate town). In 1942, to supply power to the plant, Alcan built a hydroelectric station at Shipshaw that was the largest in the world at that time. Jonquière, Arvida, and Kénogami were amalgamated into a single city, Jonquière, in 1975. Jonquière was the host city for the Quebec Games in the winter of 1976, and for the Canoe/Kayak World Championships in slalom and whitewater racing, in 1979.

Much of Jonquière's development owed its strength to the Price family, who ran a pulp and paper factory in Kénogami. Today that factory is owned by Produits Forestiers Résolu. Arvida is the home of an [[aluminium]] plant owned by Rio Tinto [[Alcan]]. Jonquière is probably best known in the United States as a result of the local [[Wal-Mart]] store which attempted to [[trade union|unionize]] and was closed down shortly thereafter. The official reason for this shutdown was "financial problems."<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4629759 "Wal-Mart Closure Touches Off Union Debate"], [[National Public Radio]].</ref>

When the city of Saguenay was constituted on February 18, 2002, by municipal amalgamation, the borough of Jonquière was created from the former city of Jonquière, the former municipality of Shipshaw, and the former municipality of Lac-Kénogami. The former city of Jonquière had a population of 54,842 in the [[Canada 2001 Census]], the last census in which Jonquière was counted as a separate city.<ref>[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=2494070&Geo2=PR&Code2=24&Data=Count&SearchText=Jonqui%E8re&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&GeoLevel=&GeoCode=2494070 2001 Statistics Canada Community Profiles: Jonquière]</ref>

The Rivière aux Sables runs through the centre of Jonquière. Significant damage to the city's buildings was caused by the 1996 [[Saguenay flood]].

==Geography==
[[Image:Chicoutimipano.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|[[Chicoutimi]] as seen from the bank of the [[Saguenay River]]
]]
Saguenay is located in a [[depression (geology)|depression]] in the [[Canadian shield]] called the [[Saguenay Graben]], which has a somewhat more [[Temperate|temperate climate]] than the surrounding region. This has encouraged agriculture and [[Colonisation|human settlement]] to take place. The relatively small and concentrated Lac St-Jean area where the city is located can be described as an isolated "[[oasis]]" in the middle of the vast remote wilderness of Northern Quebec. No paved roads go north from the area into the wilderness; the last paved roads to the north end just a short distance from the city, and still within the Lac St-Jean area. There are no human settlements due north of Saguenay all the way to the [[Canadian Arctic islands]], except for a few isolated [[Cree]] and [[Inuit]] villages. Few roads connect with the area from the south and east. However, the remote, paved [[Quebec Route 167|Route 167]]/113 heads northwest to the interior town of [[Chibougamau]], providing access to Western Quebec and [[Hudson Bay]]. No services are available for the {{convert|230|km|mi|abbr=on}} to Chibougamau from the Lac St-Jean area.

Two notable [[natural disaster]]s have occurred within the current municipal boundaries of Saguenay: the [[Saint-Jean-Vianney, Quebec|Saint-Jean-Vianney]] landslide of May 4, 1971, and the [[Saguenay flood]] of 1996. The [[1988 Saguenay earthquake]], a magnitude 5.9 earthquake on November 25, 1988, had its epicentre 35&nbsp;km south of Chicoutimi and was felt within the city.

===Climate===
Saguenay has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen Climate Classification]] ''Dfb)'' with large variation between summer and winter. The city features two brief transition seasons (spring and autumn), while summers are warm and occasionally hot, and winters are long and very cold. Temperatures drop below {{convert|-20.0|C|0}} on average 43 times per year and below {{convert|-30.0|C|0}} 6 times per year.<ref name="CCN"/> The low winter temperatures characteristic of Saguenay are caused by a combination of factors, such as the cold waters of the [[Labrador Current]] and [[Hudson Bay]] to the north and east of the city.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Saguenay was {{convert|103|F|1|order=flip}} on August 18, 1935.<ref name="August 1935"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-49|F|1|order=flip}} on February 5, 1916.<ref name="February 1916"/>

Federally, Saguenay is part of two electoral districts. The riding of [[Chicoutimi—Le Fjord]], which includes the boroughs of [[Chicoutimi]] and [[La Baie, Quebec|La Baie]] as well as most of the [[Le Fjord-du-Saguenay Regional County Municipality]], and the riding of [[Jonquière (federal electoral district)|Jonquière]], which includes the borough of [[Jonquière]] as well as the southern part and parts of the Le Fjord-du-Saguenay RCM.

Provincially, Saguenay is represented in four electoral districts. The electoral district of [[Chicoutimi (provincial electoral district)|Chicoutimi]] includes the former city of Chicoutimi, and is represented by [[Andrée Laforest]] of the [[Coalition Avenir Québec]]. The electoral district of [[Dubuc (electoral district)|Dubuc]], which covers the part of Saguenay as well as the Le Fjord-du-Saguenay RCM, is represented by [[François Tremblay]] of the [[Coalition Avenir Québec]]. The electoral district of [[Jonquière (provincial electoral district)|Jonquière]], which covers most of the borough of Jonquière, is represented by [[Sylvain Gaudreault]] of the Parti Québécois.

==Infrastructure==
Thrice weekly passenger railway service is provided by [[Via Rail]] on the [[Montreal–Jonquière train]], which runs from [[Montreal Central Station]] to [[Jonquière station]].

The city is connected by highway to [[Quebec City]] by [[Quebec Route 175]] to its south, and is also served by [[Quebec Route 172]] and [[Quebec Route 170]], which run east–west to the north and south of the [[Saguenay River]], respectively.

The city is also served by the [[Bagotville Airport]], which shares the [[CFB Bagotville|Canadian Forces Base Bagotville]] aerodrome. It operates daily flights to [[Montreal-Trudeau International Airport]] as well as flights to [[Jean Lesage International Airport|Quebec City]] and [[Sept-Îles Airport|Sept-Îles]]. It operates seasonal flights to [[Cancún]], Mexico, and vacation destinations in Cuba. Another airfield, the former [[Chicoutimi/Saint-Honoré Aerodrome]] air force base, is located to the north of the city.

A pier in La Baie has been in operation since 2008 to accommodate [[cruise ship]]s and tourists.<ref>Yves Ouellet Alain Dumas, ''En croisière sur le St-Laurent et le Saguenay,'' Les Éditions de l'Homme, 2008.</ref><ref>Saguenay, port d'escale [archive]</ref> The project required investment of about [[Canadian Dollar|$]]33.75 million for the construction of a {{convert|370|m|ft|adj=on}} wharf, a visitor centre ($5 million) and a port village.<ref>[tp://www.toutlemondeabord.com/index.html] [archive]</ref>

Saguenay derives power from its water resources.<ref>Marc St-Hilaire, « Une centrale sur la Shipshaw », ''Le Quotidien,'' Saguenay, 10 septembre 2010 [texte intégral [archive] (page consultée le September 10, 2010)]</ref> The city owns three hydroelectric power stations, one operating in the borough of Jonquière and two others, Pont-Arnaud and Chute-Garneau, in operation since spring 2011.<ref>Louis Tremblay, "Les trois axes de Promotion Saguenay," ''Le Quotidien,'' 27 août 2010, p. 7.</ref>

Saguenay is one of several "megacities" where the pre-merger telephone rate centres have never been amalgamated. It is still split between four rate centres–Chicoutimi, Jonquière, La Baie and Laterrière. As a result, North American telephone customers placing calls to Saguenay may not recognize the charge details on their bills.

==Education==
[[Image:Chicoutimi - UQAC.jpg|thumb|The [[Université du Québec à Chicoutimi]] main buildings]]
The francophone primary and secondary public schools of Saguenay are managed by two boards, the School Board of Jonquière, which has 11,015 students<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csjonquiere.qc.ca/page_csdlj.php?id=50 |title=Commission scolaire de la Jonquière - Statistiques |access-date=2011-11-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002194015/http://www.csjonquiere.qc.ca/page_csdlj.php?id=50 |archive-date=October 2, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and the school board of Rives-du-Saguenay, with 11,048 students.<ref>http://www.csrsaguenay.qc.ca////web/document/U110//Portrait20082009.pdf {{dead link|date=August 2017}}</ref> These figures include 38 primary schools, seven secondary schools and five vocational training centres in the city, and institutions of neighboring municipalities of Upper and Lower Saguenay.

At the college level, Saguenay has two colleges, located in Jonquière and in Chicoutimi, with a combined 5,500 students.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ville.saguenay.qc.ca/industriecommerce/Profil+de+Saguenay/profilSaguenay/profil_education.htm |title=Ville de Saguenay - Tourisme - Vacance - Hébergement - Restaurant - Spectacles- Fjord - Industrie et Commerce |website=www.ville.saguenay.qc.ca |access-date=12 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402010130/http://www.ville.saguenay.qc.ca/industriecommerce/Profil+de+Saguenay/profilSaguenay/profil_education.htm |archive-date=2 April 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In addition to offering pre-university programs, and similar curricula, each of the schools has unique programs. For example, the Cégep de Jonquière offers technical training in Art and Media Technology, while that of Chicoutimi offers technical training in piloting aircraft.

The [[Université du Québec à Chicoutimi|University of Quebec at Chicoutimi (UQAC)]] is located in Saguenay; this francophone campus of the province's network has 6,500 students.<ref name="KaterineBelleyMurray">Katerine Belley-Murray, « Projet structurant à portée internationale, L'horizon infini de la biobanque », Le Quotidien, 25 octobre 2011, p. 21.</ref> It provides education at university level. As the only university in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, this campus attracts students from across Quebec and la Francophonie. Located near downtown, the Chicoutimi campus includes a sports pavilion and the pavilion of the Humanities. The university has a flagship research centre in Arctic ice and other conditions; departments of Forestry, Medicine, and Arts; and the centre of aluminium technology.

===Research===
Saguenay has several main components of the regional aluminum sector: the Quebec Centre for Research and Development of Aluminum (CQRDA), the Centre for Aluminum Technology of UQAC (CTA), the University Centre for Aluminium Research (CURAL), and college and government training programs.

In 2007, the Quebec government announced, in conjunction with Genome Quebec, [[Université de Montréal]], the Centre for Health and Social Services and UQAC Chicoutimi, the creation of a biobank specializing in genomics research.<ref name="KaterineBelleyMurray" /> The CSSS de Chicoutimi also specializes in research in primary care medicine and chronic illness and the rehabilitation of neuromuscular disorders.
