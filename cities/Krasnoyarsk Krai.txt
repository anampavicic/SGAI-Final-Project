'''Krasnoyarsk Krai''' ({{langx|ru|Красноярский край}}, {{IPA|ru|krəsnɐˈjarskʲɪj ˈkraj|IPA}}) is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]] (a [[krai]]) located in [[Siberia]]. Its [[administrative center]] is the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of [[Krasnoyarsk]], the second-largest city in [[Siberia]] after [[Novosibirsk]]. Comprising half of the [[Siberian Federal District]], Krasnoyarsk Krai is the largest krai in Russia, the [[list of subdivisions of Russia by area|second-largest federal subject]] in the country after neighboring [[Sakha Republic|Sakha]], and the [[list of the largest country subdivisions by area|third-largest country subdivision by area]] in the world. The krai covers an area of {{convert|2366797|km2|sp=us}}, constituting roughly 13% of Russia's total area. Krasnoyarsk Krai has a population of 2,856,971 as of the [[2021 Russian census|2021 Census]].

==Geography==
[[File:Operational Navigation Chart C-5, 2nd edition.jpg|thumb|left|Map including part of northern Krasnoyarsk Krai]]
The krai lies in the middle of [[Siberia]], and occupies nearly half of the [[Siberian Federal District]], almost splitting it in half, stretching {{convert|3,000|km|mi|-2}} from the [[Sayan Mountains]] in the south along the [[Yenisei River]] to the [[Taymyr Peninsula]] in the north. It borders (counting clockwise from the sea) the [[Sakha Republic]], [[Irkutsk Oblast|Irkutsk]], the [[Tuva Republic]], the [[Republic of Khakassia]], [[Kemerovo Oblast|Kemerovo]], [[Tomsk Oblast|Tomsk]], [[Tyumen Oblast]]s, the [[Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug]], the [[Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug]] and the [[Kara Sea]] and [[Laptev Sea]] of the [[Arctic Ocean]] in the north.

The krai is located in the basin of the [[Arctic Ocean]]; a great number of rivers that flow through the krai [[drainage basin|drain]] into it eventually. The main rivers of the krai are the Yenisei, and its [[tributary|tributaries]] (from south to north): the [[Kan River|Kan]], the [[Angara River|Angara]], the [[Podkamennaya Tunguska River|Podkamennaya Tunguska]], the [[Nizhnyaya Tunguska River|Nizhnyaya Tunguska]] and the [[Tanama River|Tanama]].

There are also several thousand lakes in the krai. The largest lakes include Beloye, Belyo, [[Lake Glubokoye (Putorana)|Glubokoye]], Itat, [[Lake Khantayskoye|Khantayskoye]], Labas, [[Lake Lama|Lama]], Pyasina, [[Lake Taymyr|Taymyr]], and [[Lake Yessey|Yessey]]. The rivers and lakes are rich in fish.

The climate is strongly [[continental climate|continental]] with large temperature variations during the year. Long winters and short, hot summers are characteristic for the central and southern regions where most of the krai's population lives. The territory of Krasnoyarsk Krai experiences conditions of three climate belts: [[polar climate|arctic]], [[Subarctic climate|subarctic]], and [[humid continental climate|humid continental]]. In the north there are less than 40 days with temperature above {{convert|10|°C|°F}}, while in the south there are 110–120 such days.

The average temperature in January is {{convert|-36|C|1}} in the north and {{convert|-18|C|1}} in the south. The average temperature in July is {{convert|5|to|10|C}} in the north – where the most poleward [[tree line]] in the world is found at [[Ary-Mas]] – and {{convert|+20|C}} in the south. The annual precipitation is {{convert|316|mm|sp=us}} (up to {{convert|1200|mm|sp=us}} in the foothills of the Sayan Mountains). Snow covers the central regions of the krai from early November until late March. The peaks of the Sayan Mountains higher than {{convert|2,400|-|2,600|m|ft|-2}} and those of the [[Putorana Plateau]] higher than {{convert|1,000|-|1,300|m|ft}} are covered with permanent snow. [[Permafrost]] is absent at low altitudes south of [[Lesosibirsk]], but as one moves north it grades from [[sporadic permafrost|sporadic]] around [[58th parallel north|the 58th parallel]] to [[discontinuous permafrost|extensive discontinuous]] around [[60th parallel north|the 60th parallel]] and [[continuous permafrost|continuous]] north of [[63rd parallel north|the 63rd parallel]].

The coastline contains several prominent peninsulas – from west to east the main ones are the [[Minina Peninsula]], [[Mikhailov Peninsula]], the [[Taymyr Peninsula]] (by far the largest, and itself containing the Zarya Peninsula, Oskara Peninsula and [[Chelyuskin Peninsula]]) and the Khara-Tumus Peninsula.

There are also a large number of islands off the krai's coast, the most prominent of which are (from west to east) [[Sibiryakov Island]], Nosok Island, [[Dikson Island]], Vern Island, Brekhovskiye Island (in the [[Yenisei Gulf]]), Krestovskiy Island, the [[Kamennye Islands]], the [[Zveroboy Islands]], the [[Labyrintovye Islands]], the [[Plavnikovye Islands]], [[Kolosovykh Island]], the [[Mona Islands]], Rykacheva Island, Gavrilova Island, Belukha and Prodolgovatyy Islands, the [[Nordenskiöld Archipelago]], the [[Firnley Islands]], the [[Heiberg Islands]], [[Starokadomsky Island]], [[Maly Taymyr Island]], the [[Komsomolskaya Pravda Islands]], the [[Faddey Islands]], and the [[Saint Peter Islands]]. There are also a number of islands further out that fall under the administration of Krasnoyarsk Krai – the most prominent being Bolshoy Island, [[Sverdrup Island (Kara Sea)|Sverdrup Island]], the [[Izvestiy TSIK Islands]], the [[Arkticheskiy Institut Islands]], the [[Kirov Islands]], [[Uyedineniya Island]], [[Voronina Island]], [[Severnaya Zemlya]] (the largest group), and [[Ushakov Island]].
The highest point of the krai is [[Grandiozny Peak]] in the [[Eastern Sayan]] Mountains at an elevation of {{convert|2922|m|sp=us}}.

In the south there is a [[Ergaki Nature Park]] which is a [[protected area]] of Krasnoyarsk Krai. It contains the Western Sayan Mountains.<ref name="Park">{{cite web |title=История |url=https://ergaki-park.ru/about/history/ |website=ergaki-park.ru |publisher=Ergaki Natural Park |access-date=16 January 2024}}</ref> The park was established in 2005 and it covers an area of {{cvt|342,873|ha}}.<ref name="Baklitskaya">{{cite news |last1=Baklitskaya |first1=Kate |title=Siberian Secrets - the majestic Yergaki National Park |url=https://siberiantimes.com/home/sent-to-siberia/siberian-secrets-the-majestic-yergaki-national-park/ |access-date=16 January 2024 |work=siberiantimes.com |publisher=The Siberian Times |date=1 November 2012}}</ref> It is bordered by the Yenisei highway.<ref name="Mikhailovich">{{cite news |last1=Mikhailovich |first1=Ryzhenkov Vladimir |title=Природный парк «Ергаки» / Досье / Справка |url=https://newslab.ru/info/dossier/prirodnyj-park-ergaki |access-date=16 January 2024 |work=newslab.ru |publisher=News Laboratory LLC |date=2024}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Mother of God-Nativity Cathedral (Krasnoyarsk) 1900.jpg|thumb|Mother of God-Nativity Cathedral (Krasnoyarsk) 1900]]
According to archaeologists, the first people reached Siberia circa 40,000 [[Before Christ|BC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnh.si.edu/arctic/html/peopling_siberia.html |title=Arctic Social Sciences - Arctic Studies Center |publisher=Mnh.si.edu |access-date=2012-09-27}}</ref> The [[Andronovo culture]], a group of [[Bronze Age]] peoples, lived in the area around 2000–900 BC, the remains of which were discovered in 1914 near the village of Andronovo, [[Uzhursky District]]. The grave-mounds and monuments of the [[Scythian]] culture in Krasnoyarsk Krai belong to the 7th century BC and are some of the oldest in [[Eurasia]]. A prince's grave, the Kurgan Arshan, discovered in 2001, is also located in the krai.

Russian settlement of the area (mostly by [[Cossacks]]) began in the 17th century. After the construction of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] the Russian colonization of the area strongly increased. In 1822, the [[Yeniseysk Governorate]] was created with Krasnoyarsk as its administrative center that covered territory very similar to that of the current krai.

During both the [[Tsar]]ist and the [[Soviet]] times, the territory of Krasnoyarsk Krai was used as a place of exile of political enemies, actual or alleged. The first leaders of the Soviet state, [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Joseph Stalin]], were exiled to what is now the krai in 1897–1900 and 1903, respectively. In Stalin's era, numerous [[Gulag]] camps were located in the region.

On June&nbsp;30, 1908, in the basin of the [[Podkamennaya Tunguska|Podkamennaya Tunguska River]], there occurred a [[Tunguska event|powerful explosion]] most likely to have been caused by the air burst of a large [[meteoroid]] or [[comet]] fragment at an altitude of {{convert|5|–|10|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} above the Earth's surface. The force of the explosion is estimated to be about 10–15 megatons. It flattened more than {{convert|2,000|km2|acre|abbr=off|sp=us}} of pine forest and killed thousands of reindeer.

Krasnoyarsk Krai was created in 1934 after disaggregation of the [[West Siberian Krai|West Siberian]] and East Siberian Krais and later included [[Taymyr Autonomous Okrug|Taymyr]] and [[Evenk Autonomous Okrug]]s and [[Khakas Autonomous Oblast]]. In 1991, [[Khakassia]] separated from the krai and became a republic within the Russian Federation. On January&nbsp;1, 2007, following a referendum on the issue held on April&nbsp;17, 2005, the territories of [[Evenk Autonomous Okrug|Evenk]] and [[Taymyr Autonomous Okrug]]s were merged into the krai.

==Politics==
[[File:Krasnoyarsk Mira 110 krai admin.jpg|thumb|The seat of the oblast administration in the Revolution Square, 2005]]

During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the krai was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Krasnoyarsk CPSU Committee (who in reality had the most authority), the chairman of the krai Soviet (legislative power), and the chairman of the krai Executive Committee (executive power). Since the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 and the demise of the [[CPSU]], the head of the krai administration, and eventually the governor has been appointed or elected alongside the elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

The Charter of Krasnoyarsk Krai is the fundamental law of the region. The [[Legislative Assembly of Krasnoyarsk Krai]] is the province's [[regional parliaments of Russia|regional]] standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The legislative assembly consists of 52 deputies. 22 of them are elected in 22 one-mandate electoral districts by [[plurality system]], 2 in Taymyr, 2 in Evenkia, and 26 are elected by [[proportional representation system|proportional system]] from the lists offered by political parties. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day-to-day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as the guarantor of the observance of the krai Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].

In December 1991, president [[Boris Yeltsin]] appointed Arkady Veprev as the first governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai. In January 1993 Yeltsin appointed Valery Zubov as the second governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai. In Krasnoyarsk Territory governor elections were called. Zubov was elected in a universal election for a five-year term. The [[Legislative Assembly of Krasnoyarsk Krai]] was created as well.

In 1998, Zubov lost in the gubernatorial election to [[Aleksandr Ivanovich Lebed|General Aleksandr Lebed]], a well-known politician in all of Russia. In 2002 Lebed died in a helicopter accident.

In 2002, [[Alexander Khloponin]], the governor of [[Taymyr Autonomous Okrug]] and an influential businessman, was elected a governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai. In 2007, he was nominated by [[President of Russia|president]] [[Vladimir Putin]] for re-election, and the legislative assembly elected Khloponin for the second term.

In 2010, after Khloponin was promoted to the office of the president's envoy in the [[North Caucasian Federal District]], [[Lev Kuznetsov (politician)|Lev Kuznetsov]], a businessman and politician from Khloponin's circle, became the new governor of the krai. After Kuznetsov, [[Viktor Tolokonsky]] became Governor September 2017. After Tolokonsky, [[Aleksandr Uss]] became the [[Governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai]] where he remains in the role today.

Krasnoyarsk Krai is represented in the [[Federation Council of Russia]], the [[upper house]] of the [[Federal Assembly (Russia)|Russian parliament]] by two senators. In 2007, eight deputies were elected to the [[State Duma]] from Krasnoyarsk regional lists of different [[Political parties in Russia|political parties]].

==Economy==
