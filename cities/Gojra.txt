== History ==

===Pre-Independence===
Gojra city was established in 1896, when the colonisation of [[Faisalabad]] began. The railway line between Faisalabad and Gojra was laid in 1899. The town was given the status of [[notified area]] committee in 1904 and upgraded to a B-Class Municipality in 1925. In 1906, the population was 2,589. According to ''[[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]]'', "The business done in this rising mart on the railway, which has sprung into existence in the last six years owing to the extension of the Chenab Canal to the surrounding country, bides fair to rival in importance that of Faisalabad itself".<ref name="IGI"/><ref name=":0" />

In 1919, following the [[Rowlatt Act]], [[hartal]]s (strikes) broke out throughout Punjab. Gojra was affected by the serious protests and a member of the [[Church Mission Society]] had to be escorted out of the town by loyal residents.<ref>Punjab disturbances, April 1919; compiled from the ''Civil and Military Gazette.'' (1919)</ref><ref name=":0" />

===Post-Independence===
In August 1947, India and Pakistan achieved independence. Riots and local fighting followed the expeditious withdrawal of the [[British Raj|British]], resulting in an estimated one million civilians deaths, particularly in the western region of Punjab.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/partition1947_01.shtml | title=The Hidden Story of Partition and its Legacies | work=British History | publisher=BBC website|date=3 March 2011 |access-date=17 May 2023| author=Crispin Bates}}</ref> Gojra, which was in the region of the Punjab Province that became [[West Pakistan]], was populated by a number of [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s who migrated to India, while [[Muslim]] refugees from India settled in the district.<ref name="Yale">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/greatpartitionma00khan | title=The Great Partition: The Making of India and Pakistan | publisher=Yale University Press | author=Yasmin Khan | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-300-12078-3 | url-access=registration }}</ref>

After independence from Britain, in view of its increasing size, Gojra was declared a 2nd class Municipal Committee in 1960. Gojra received the status of tehsil town and affiliated with the newly established district Toba Tek Singh on 1 July 1982. After the introduction of Devolution of Power Plan, the Tehsil Municipal Administration Gojra came into being on 12 August 2001.<ref name=":0" />
