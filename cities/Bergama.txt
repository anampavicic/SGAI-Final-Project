'''Bergama''' is a municipality and [[Districts of Turkey|district]] of [[İzmir Province]], [[Turkey]].<ref>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx Büyükşehir İlçe Belediyesi], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory. Retrieved 12 July 2023.</ref> Its area is 1,544&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.harita.gov.tr/uploads/files-folder/il_ilce_alanlari.xlsx|title=İl ve İlçe Yüz ölçümleri|publisher=General Directorate of Mapping|access-date=12 July 2023}}</ref> and its population is 105,754 (2022).<ref name=tuik>{{Cite web |title=Address-based population registration system (ADNKS) results dated 31 December 2022, Favorite Reports|url=https://biruni.tuik.gov.tr/medas/?kn=95&locale=en |access-date=12 July 2023|publisher=[[TÜİK]]|language=en|format=XLS}}</ref> By excluding [[İzmir]]'s metropolitan area, it is one of the prominent districts of the province in terms of population and is largely urbanized at the rate of 53.6%. Bergama center is situated at a distance of {{convert|118|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the north from the point of departure of the traditional center of İzmir ([[Konak Square]] in [[Konak, İzmir]]) and lies at a distance of {{convert|27|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} inland from the nearest seacoast at the town of [[Dikili]] to its west. Bergama district area neighbors the areas of three districts of [[Balıkesir Province]] to its north, namely [[Ayvalık]], [[Burhaniye]] and [[İvrindi]], [[İzmir Province]] district of [[Kınık]] and [[Manisa Province]] district of [[Soma, Manisa|Soma]] to its east, while to the south it is bordered by [[Yunusemre]] district of Manisa Province and two other İzmir Province districts along the coast that are [[Aliağa]] and [[Dikili]] from its south towards its west. The district area's physical features are determined by the alluvial plain of [[Bakırçay]] River.

==Name==
The name Bergama, as well as its ancient predecessor [[Pergamon]],<ref name=PECS>{{Cite PECS|Pergamon-2|Pergamon}}</ref> are thought to be connected with the even more ancient [[Luwian language]] adjective ''"parrai"'' ([[Hittite language]] equivalent; ''"parku"''), meaning ''"high"'' in the same vein as being the etymological root of a number of other ancient cities across [[Anatolia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tied.verbix.com/project/glossary/anat.html|title=Common Anatolian Glossary|last=Babaev|first=Cyril|website=tied.verbix.com|access-date=2018-03-08}}</ref> The ancient and modern Greek language form of the name is {{langx|el|Πέργαμος}}. In Turkish language, it has been adapted to '''Bergama'''. The name of Pergamos derives from Perga (as keramos from kera=earth, clay), although a Turkish author  [[Özhan Öztürk]] claims that ''Bergama'' means "high settlement/base" in [[Hittite language]]{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}, while Argoma (modern [[Suluova]]) in [[Amasya]] means "border settlement" at the [[Hittites|Hittite]]-[[Kaskians|Kaskian]] border.<ref>Hittite Parku "high" + huma(ti)  “base/settlement" and Arguma erha  “border" + huma(ti)  “base/settlement"  [[Özhan Öztürk]].

==General features==
Currently, known for its cotton, gold, and fine carpets, the city was the ancient Greek and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] cultural center of [[Pergamon]]; its wealth of ancient ruins continues to attract considerable tourist interest today, although its famous Temple has been moved to the Pergamon Museum, in Berlin, Germany.

Located on a promontory north of the [[Bakırçay]] river, {{convert|26|km|0|abbr=off}} inland from the [[Aegean Sea]], Bergama has a population of about 102,000. The ruins of the ancient city of [[Pergamon]] lie to the north and west of the modern city; Roman Pergamon is believed to have sustained a population of approximately 150,000 at its height in the 1st century AD.

Among Bergama's notable ruins are the Sanctuary of Asclepius (or ''[[Asclepeion]]''), a temple dedicated to an [[Greek mythology|ancient Greek]] god of healing, a Greek Theater, and the [[Red Basilica]] complex ("Kızıl Avlu" in Turkish) that straddles the Selinus River, a 2nd-century AD construction likely built by [[Hadrian]]. The town also features an archaeological museum.

== History==
[[File:Asia Minor 188 BCE.jpg|thumb|The Attalid kingdom of Pergamon (colored olive) shown at its greatest extent in 188 BC]]
The city of [[Pergamon]] was the capital of the [[Attalid kingdom]] from 281 BC to 133 BC and then became part of the Roman province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]].<ref name="PECS" /> It remained under Eastern Roman rule in the Middle Ages except for [[Sassanid]] invasion in 620s, [[Umayyad]] invasion in 715 and [[Sultanate of Rum]] rule between 1074 and 1097. It was conquered by [[Karasids]] and then [[Aydinids]] in 1302. It was part of [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1337. During Ottoman rule, it was part of the [[Sanjak of Karesi]] between 1337 and 1868, in [[Sanjak of Saruhan|Saruhan]] one (Its centre was [[Manisa]]) between 1868 and 1877 and finally in [[İzmir]] one. From 1867 until 1922, Bergama was part of [[Aidin Vilayet]]. During the [[Turkish War of Independence]], it was occupied by [[Greece]] on June 19, 1919, but came under Turkish control on September 14, 1922. The [[Greek Army]] burnt down the city while retreating in 1922.

==Climate==
Bergama has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa''),<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Table 1 Overview of the Köppen-Geiger climate classes including the defining criteria. |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02549-6/tables/1 |journal=Nature: Scientific Data |language=en}}</ref> with very hot, dry summers, and cool to mild, moderately wet winters.{{Weather box

Bergama is also known for its historic quarter, where old [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] houses in the traditional style are found.

==Allianoi==
{{main|Allianoi}}
'''Allianoi''' is an ancient [[spa]] settlement, with remains dating predominantly from the [[Roman Empire]] period (2nd century AD) located near the city of Bergama (ancient [[Pergamon]]) in [[Turkey]]'s [[İzmir Province]]. The site is at a distance of {{convert|18|km|0|abbr=off}} to the northeast of Bergama, on the road to the neighboring town of [[İvrindi]].

One particularity of Allianoi is its being a very recent historical discovery. It was mentioned only once in the 2nd century by the orator and medicinal writer [[Aelius Aristides]] in his "Hieroi Logoi" (''Sacred Tales'') (III.1), one of the key sources for the knowledge on the science of healing as it was understood at that time. No other writer of antiquity nor any [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] finding known had referred to Allianoi.

==Kozak Plateau==
[[File:Road to Kozak Plateau Bergama Turkey.jpg|left|thumb|Country road in Kozak Plateau]]
Kozak Plateau (''Kozak Yaylası'') is a high plain at an altitude varying between {{convert|500|and|1000|m|abbr=off}} and starting at a distance of {{convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from Bergama center in the northern direction. The plain is a favorite regional excursion area, famed for its hand-made textile products and pine forests whose [[pine nut]] is also extensively exported.

==Ovacık gold mine==
Recently, Bergama also made headlines in the context of controversies based on environmental concerns over the [[gold mine]] in [[Ovacık, Bergama|Ovacık]] village.<ref>''Managing cyanide: health, safety and risk management practices at Turkey's Ovacik gold–silver mine'', [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652605000648 Journal of Cleaner Production vol. 14, 8, 2]</ref><ref>"''European Court of Human Rights judgment on the Bergama Mine in Turkey''" [http://www.minesandcommunities.org/article.php?a=1031  Mines and Communities], published 01-05-2001, access on 31-03-2012</ref>

== Wind turbine manufacturing ==
[[LM Wind Power]], a division of [[GE Renewable Energy]], opened a [[wind turbine]] blade manufacturing facility in Bergama in 2017. The first blades it produced were used at the [[Bodangora Wind Farm]] in New South Wales, Australia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ge.com/reports/fresh-wind-turkish-turbine-blade-factory-invigorates-historic-town/|title=Fresh Air: Turkish Turbine Blade Factory Invigorates Historic Town|last=Coffey|first=Brendan|date=2019-09-13|website=GE Reports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-28}}</ref>

==Bergama Carpets==
{{main|Bergama carpet}}
[[File:Bergamacarpets.jpg|thumb|Bergama Carpets]]
Bergama is also renowned for its high quality carpets. There are approximately eighty villages that still weave [[Bergama carpet]]s. The history of carpet weaving in Bergama dates back to the 11th century - when Turkish migration started to the area. Bergama carpets have almost always been woven with wool - an attestation to the pastoral life style of the [[Yörük]] clans populating the area at the time.

Although the history of carpet weaving in Bergama dates back to the 11th century, most surviving carpets do not age more than 200 years - mainly due to their wool content. The oldest surviving Bergama carpets can be found in mosques in and around Bergama, as well as the archaeological museum in Bergama.

==Bergama Festival==
Between June 18–24, Bergama celebrates its annual festival "Bergama Kermesi", which is already running into its seventy-second anniversary. Bergama Kermesi is a major local event, generally celebrated with the attendance of Turkish celebrities, singers, players, poets, and writers.

==Composition==
There are 135 [[mahalle|neighbourhoods]] in Bergama District:<ref>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx Mahalle], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory. Retrieved 12 July 2023.</ref>
