'''Barnala''' is a [[city]] in the state of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] of [[India]]. Barnala city serves as the headquarters of the [[Barnala district]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=District Barnala, Punjab, India |url=https://barnala.gov.in/ |access-date=2023-06-06 |language=en-US}}</ref> which was formed in 2006. Prior to formation of Barnala district, this city was located in [[Sangrur district]]. It is a centrally located district bordered by Ludhiana district on the north, Moga district on northwest, Bathinda district on west, Sangrur district on east and Mansa district on south side.

==History==
Sikh historian Giani has recorded the details of setting up of Barnala in the annals of [[Khalsa]] in this manner that in the year 1775 [[Baba Ala Singh]] after offering [[Bhadaur]] (set up by King Padhar Sain) to his brother Duna Singh came to Barnala region which was lying aloof at that time. Setting it up, he made it his capital and took under his control surrounding villages. It too appears that Anahatgarh may be existing before and must have been deserted following attacks of Dharvis.
 
There are different opinions about the nomenclature of Barnala. Some are of the view, Vaaran being a region because of frequent storms was at that time also called Varna. So Barnala was called a [[land]] of too many storms which later on became Barnala because of precision of example. Another view reveals that a fort here is said to be built by Baba Ala Singh And Baba Anahat khan in which there was a ‘Baahuli’ (a well which had stairs going down). That too due to precision and Malwai accent was known as ‘Baain’. Thus Baain Wala ultimately became Barnala. Thus these are different views only but no historical detail is available that how name Barnala came into existence.
Barnala was named after Baba Ala Singh. Baba Ala Singh left Bhadaur with his elder brother (hometown of Patiala State) and settled at Barnala and conquered many areas with the help of his brothers the Bhadaur Sardars. Though it was a [[district]] headquarters in erstwhile princely state system, it was later merged in [[PEPSU]] (Patiala & East Punjab States Union) and degraded as sub divisional headquarters.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

There is a stone "Rameshwaram Stone" in Nath Wala Dera – Village Handiaya Adjoining with Barnala that one floating in water.
