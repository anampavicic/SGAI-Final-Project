The city's history dates back to around 890, as per the old Kannada stone inscription found at the [[Nageshvara Temple, Begur|Nageshwara Temple]] in [[Begur, Bangalore]]. In 1537, [[Kempe Gowda I|Kempé Gowdā]], a feudal ruler under the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], established a [[Bengaluru Pete|mud fort]], considered the foundation of modern Bangalore and its oldest areas, or ''pétés'', which still exist. After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, Kempe Gowda declared independence; in 1638, a large [[Adil Shahi]] Bijapur army defeated Kempe Gowda III, and Bangalore came under [[Shahaji Bhonsle]] as a [[jagir]], which later became his capital. The [[Mughals]] later captured Bangalore and sold it to [[Maharaja of Mysore|Maharaja]] [[Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar|Devaraja Wodeyar II]] of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]].<ref name="ekoji" /> When [[Hyder Ali|Haider Ali]] seized control of the kingdom, Bangalore's administration passed into his hands.

The city was captured by the [[British East India Company]] after victory in the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] (1799), which then returned administrative control of the city, along with the kingdom, to Maharaja [[Krishnaraja Wadiyar III]]. The old city developed under the dominions of the maharaja. In 1809, the British shifted their [[Bangalore Cantonment|cantonment]] to Bangalore, outside the old city, and a town grew up around it. Following [[independence of India|India's independence]] in 1947, Bangalore became the capital of [[Mysore State]], and remained the capital when the state was [[Unification of Karnataka|enlarged and unified]] in 1956 and renamed Karnataka in 1973. The two urban settlements of Bangalore, the [[Bengaluru Pete|town]] and the cantonment, which had developed as independent entities, merged into a single urban centre in 1949. The existing [[Kannada]] name, ''Bengalūru'', was declared the city's [[official name]] in 2006.

== Etymology ==

''Bangalore'' is an [[anglicised]] version of the city's [[Kannada]] name ''Bengalūru''. It was the name of a village near Kodigehalli in Bangalore city today and was used by [[Kempe Gowda I|Kempe Gowda]] to name the city as Bangalore at the time of its foundation in 1537. The earliest reference to the name "Bengalūru" was found in a ninth-century [[Western Ganga dynasty]] stone inscription on a ''vīra gallu'' ({{lang-kn|ವೀರಗಲ್ಲು|link=no}}; {{lit|[[hero stone]]}}, a rock edict extolling the virtues of a warrior). According to an Old Kannada inscription found in [[Begur, Bangalore|Begur]], "Bengalūrū" was the place of a battle in 890&nbsp;[[Common Era|CE]].<ref name="OtherNames">{{cite news |first=K |last=Chandramouli |url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/25/stories/2002072500270200.htm |title=The city of boiled beans |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=25 July 2002 |access-date=10 June 2012 |location=Chennai, India |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505010927/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/25/stories/2002072500270200.htm |archive-date=5 May 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="TheHinduinscription">{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/08/20/stories/2004082016400300.htm |title=Inscription reveals Bengaluru is over 1,000 years old |date=20 August 2004 |access-date=10 June 2012 |location=Chennai, India |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213021302/http://www.hindu.com/2004/08/20/stories/2004082016400300.htm |archive-date=13 February 2012 |url-status=dead |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] }}</ref>

An [[apocryphal]] story states that the twelfth-century [[Hoysala]] king [[Veera Ballala II]], while on a hunting expedition, lost his way in the forest. Tired and hungry, he came across a poor old woman who served him boiled beans.

Modern Bangalore was begun in 1537 by the [[chieftain]] [[Kempe Gowda I]], who aligned with the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] under Emperor [[Achyuta Deva Raya]] to campaign against Gangaraja (whom he defeated and expelled to Kanchi), and who built [[Bengaluru Pete|a mud-brick fort]] for the people at the site that would become the central part of modern Bangalore. Kempe Gowda was restricted by rules made by the Emperor, who feared the potential power of Kempe Gowda and did not allow a stone fort. Kempe Gowda referred to the new town as his "''gandubhūmi''" or "Land of Heroes".<ref name="gandubhoomi">{{cite news |url=http://www.livemint.com/2010/05/21205005/Bangalore-Bhath--First-city-e.html |title=Bangalore bhath: first city edifices |last1=Misra |first1=Hemant |last2=Jayaraman |first2=Pavitra |newspaper=[[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]] |date=22 May 2010 | access-date=11 June 2012}}</ref> Within the fort, the town was divided into smaller divisions, each called a ''pētē'' ({{IPA-kn|peːteː}}).<ref>{{Cite news |last=Aruni |first=S.
