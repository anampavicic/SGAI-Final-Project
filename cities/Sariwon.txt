==Tourism==

The "Sariwŏn Folklore street" was constructed during Kim Jong-il's rule. Built to display an ideal picture of ancient Korea, it includes buildings in the "historical style" and a collection of ancient Korean cannons.<!-- Although it is considered an inaccurate romanticized recreation of an ancient Korean street{{by whom?|date=August 2022}}, it is frequently used as a destination for foreigners on official government tours{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}.--> Many older style Korean buildings exist in the city.

In 2020, Jongbangsan Hotel opened after several years of delays in construction. It has three main buildings and includes a gym and a swimming pool.<ref>{{cite news|title=New North Korean hotel opens after 10-year construction period|url=https://www.nknews.org/2021/10/new-north-korean-hotel-opens-after-10-year-construction-period/|publisher=NK News|first=Chad|last=O'Carroll|date=21 October 2021}}</ref>

Sariwŏn has a [[trolleybus]] system with two [[Ikarus 280|Ikarus 280T]] articulated trolleybuses; they were converted from diesel Ikarus 280 buses due to the lack of roof equipment. Regular trolleybuses were mothballed at the depot from 2020. The service is supplemented by regular buses.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sariwon|url=https://transphoto.org/city/1360/|access-date=2021-01-02|website=transphoto.org}}</ref>
