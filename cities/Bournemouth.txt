'''Bournemouth''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Bournemouth.ogg|ˈ|b|ɔːr|n|m|ə|θ}} {{respell|BORN|məth}}) is a [[coastal resort]] town in the [[Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole]] unitary authority area, in the [[ceremonial county]] of [[Dorset]], England. The 2021 census built-up area had a population of 196,455, making it the largest town in Dorset.

Previously an uninhabited and rarely-visited  [[heathland]], other than by occasional fishermen and smugglers, a health resort was founded in the area by [[Lewis Tregonwell]] in 1810.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Granville|first=A. B.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/539370|title=Spas of England and principal sea-bathing places|date=1971|publisher=Adams and Dart|isbn=0-239-00085-4|edition=[1st ed. reprinted]|location=Bath|oclc=539370}}</ref> After the [[Ringwood, Christchurch and Bournemouth Railway]] opened in 1870, it grew into an important resort town which attracts over five million visitors annually with the town's beaches and popular nightlife. It now has a financial sector that is worth more than £1 billion in [[gross value added]].

Part of [[Hampshire]] since before the [[Domesday Book]], it was assigned to Dorset under the [[Local Government Act 1972]] in 1974. [[Bournemouth Borough Council]] became a [[unitary authority]] in 1997 and was replaced by [[Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council]] in 2019; the current unitary authority also covers [[Poole]], [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]] and adjoining land.

The [[Bournemouth Town Centre|town centre]] has notable [[Victorian architecture]]. [[St Peter's Church, Bournemouth|St Peter's Church]] has a {{convert|202|ft|m|adj=on}} spire and is one of three [[Listed building|Grade I]] listed churches in the borough. The town also has both an events venue and a concert hall, the [[Bournemouth International Centre]] (BIC) and [[Pavilion Theatre, Bournemouth|Pavilion Theatre]] respectively.

The first mention of Bournemouth comes in the [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]] [[cartulary]] of 1406, where a [[monk]] describes how a large fish ("uni magno piscis"), {{convert|18|ft|abbr=off}} long, was washed up at "La Bournemothe" in October of that year and taken to the Manor of [[Wick, Bournemouth|Wick]]; six days later, a portion of the fish was collected by a canon from [[Christchurch Priory]] and taken away as [[tithe]].<ref>A.

==History==
{{Main|History of Bournemouth}}
[[File:Bournemouth area 1759 map.jpg|thumb|Section of a 1759 map of Hampshire by Isaac Taylor, showing the Manor of Christchurch and the area around the Bourne chine]]
In the 12th century the region around the mouth of the [[River Bourne, Dorset|River Bourne]] was part of the [[Hundred (county subdivision)|Hundred]] of [[Holdenhurst]]. The hundred later became the [[Liberty of Westover]] when it was extended to include the settlements of North Ashley, [[Muscliff]], Muccleshell, [[Throop, Dorset|Throop]], [[Iford, Dorset|Iford]], [[Pokesdown]], [[Tuckton]] and [[Wick, Bournemouth|Wick]], and incorporated into the Manor of [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]].<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Page |editor-first=William |title=A History of the County of Hampshire |chapter=The liberty of Westover: with Holdenhurst and Bournemouth |volume=5 |chapter-url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42061 |year=1912 |publisher=Constable & Co. |pages=133–137 |access-date=17 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103205859/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42061 |archive-date=3 November 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Although the [[Dorset]] and [[Hampshire]] region surrounding it had been the site of human settlement for thousands of years, Westover was largely a remote and barren [[heathland]] before 1800.<ref name="EE1-2">Edwards (pp. 1–2)</ref> In 1574 the [[Henry Wriothesley, 2nd Earl of Southampton|Earl of Southampton]] noted that the area was "Devoid of all habitation", and as late as 1795 the [[John Manners, 5th Duke of Rutland|Duke of Rutland]] recorded that "...&nbsp;on this barren and uncultivated heath there was not a human to direct us".<ref name=EE24/><ref>Cave (p.4)</ref>

There were some prehistoric settlements in the area, notably along the River Stour, including [[Longham, Dorset|Longham]] where a skull thought to be 5,500 years old was found in 1932. [[Bronze Age]] burials near [[Moordown]], and the discovery of [[Iron Age]] pottery on the East Cliff in 1969, suggest there may have been settlements there during that period. [[Hengistbury Head]], added to the borough in 1932, was the site of a much older [[Palaeolithic]] encampment.<ref name=Ashleys>Ashley and Ashley (p.7)</ref><ref name="EE1-3">Edwards (pp.1–3)</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Stannard|first=Michael|title=The Makers of Christchurch: A Thousand Year story|year=1999|publisher=Natula Publications|isbn=978-1-897887-22-6|page=223}}</ref> During the latter half of the 16th century [[Lord Mountjoy|James Blount, 6th Baron Mountjoy]], began mining for [[alum]] in the area, and at one time part of the heath was used for hunting, although by the late 18th century little evidence of either event remained.<ref>Ashley and Ashley (p.31)</ref><ref>Edwards (pp.2 & 27)</ref> No-one lived at the mouth of the Bourne river and the only regular visitors to the area before the 19th century were a few fishermen, turf cutters and gangs of [[smugglers]].<ref>Edwards (pp.4 & 38)</ref>

[[File:Invalids' walk, Bournemouth, Dorset, England, 1890s.jpg|thumb|left|[[Photochrom]] of Invalids' Walk, 1890s]]
Prior to the [[Christchurch Inclosures Act 1802]], more than 70%<!--5000/7000*100--> of the Westover area was [[common land]]. The act, together with the Inclosure Commissioners' Award of 1805, transferred {{Convert|5000|acres}} into the hands of five private owners, including [[James Harris, 1st Earl of Malmesbury]], and [[George Ivison Tapps|Sir George Ivison Tapps]].<ref>Andrews & Henson (p.8)</ref><ref>Ashley and Ashley (pp.18–19)</ref> In 1809 the Tapps Arms [[public house]] was built on the heath. A few years later, in 1812, the first official residents, retired army officer [[Lewis Tregonwell]] and his wife, moved into their new home built on land purchased from Tapps. The area was well known to Tregonwell who, during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], spent much of his time searching the heath and coastline for French invaders and smugglers.<ref name=DLM>{{cite web| url = http://www.dorsetlife.co.uk/2010/03/the-beginnings-of-bournemouth/| title = The Beginnings of Bournemouth| author = John Walker| date = March 2010| publisher = Dorset Life Magazine| access-date = 23 October 2012| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120122014130/http://www.dorsetlife.co.uk/2010/03/the-beginnings-of-bournemouth/| archive-date = 22 January 2012| url-status = live}}</ref>

Anticipating that people would come to the area to indulge in the newly fashionable pastime of [[sea-bathing]], an activity with perceived health benefits, Tregonwell built a series of [[villa]]s on his land between 1816 and 1822, which he hoped to let out.<ref name=AA6>Ashley & Ashley (p.6)</ref><ref name=EE28>Edwards (p.28)</ref> The common belief that pine-scented air was good for lung conditions, and in particular [[tuberculosis]], prompted Tregonwell and Tapps to plant hundreds of [[pine trees]]. These early attempts to promote the town as a health resort meant that by the time Tregonwell died in 1832, Bournemouth had grown into a small community with a scattering of houses, villas and cottages.<ref name=AA6/><ref name=Jubilee3/> The town would ultimately grow up around the scattered pines and tree-lined walk to the beach, later to become known as the Invalids' Walk.<ref name="EE31-32">Edwards (pp.31–32)</ref><ref name=AA17>Ashley & Ashley (p.17)</ref>

After the death of Tapps in 1835, his son Sir [[George William Tapps-Gervis]] inherited his father's estate. He hired the young local architect [[Benjamin Ferrey]] to develop [[Bournemouth Gardens, England|Bournemouth Gardens]] along the coastal area on the east side of the stream.<ref name=E16>Emery (p.16)</ref> Bournemouth's first hotel, later to become part of the [[Royal Bath Hotel]], opened in 1838 and is one of the few buildings designed by Ferrey still standing<ref name=Jubilee3>{{cite web|url=http://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/NewsEvents/SpotlightFeatures/SupportingContent/BournemouthBrouchure08.pdf |title=Bournemouth, Garden by the Sea |work=Diamond Jubilee Civic Honours Bid |page=3 |date=May 2011 |publisher=Bournemouth County Council |access-date=9 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620195158/http://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/NewsEvents/SpotlightFeatures/SupportingContent/BournemouthBrouchure08.pdf |archive-date=20 June 2013 }}</ref><ref name=E16/> and operating. Bournemouth grew at a faster rate as Tapps-Gervis began developing the area similarly to the south coast resorts of [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] and [[Brighton]]. Despite enormous investment, the town's share of the market remained modest.<ref name="EE31-32"/> In 1841 Tapps-Gervis invited the physician and writer [[Augustus Granville]] to stay. Granville was the author of ''The Spas of England'', which described health resorts around the country, and as a result of his visit, he included a chapter on Bournemouth in the second edition of his book.<ref name=":0" /> The publication of the book, and the increase in visitors seeking the medicinal use of seawater and the pine-scented air, helped the town to grow and establish itself as an early tourist destination.<ref name="EE38-40">Edwards (pp.38–40)</ref><ref name="AA10-11">Ashley & Ashley (pp.10–11)</ref>

In the 1840s Benjamin Ferrey was replaced by [[Decimus Burton]], whose plans for Bournemouth included the construction of [[Bournemouth Gardens, England|Bournemouth Gardens]] alongside the [[River Bourne, Dorset|Bourne stream]], an idea first mooted by Granville. The fields south of the road crossing (later [[Bournemouth Square]]) were drained and laid out with shrubberies and walks. Many of these paths, including the Invalids' Walk, remain in the town today.<ref name="AA10-11"/><ref name="EE70-71">Edwards (pp.70–71)</ref> A second suggestion of Granville's, a sanatorium, was completed in 1855 and greatly raised Bournemouth's profile as a place for recuperation.<ref>Emery (p.21)</ref>

At a time when the most convenient way to arrive in the town was by sea, a [[pier]] was considered to be a necessity. The Holdenhurst parish [[vestry]] was reluctant to find the money, and an attempt to raise funds privately in 1847 had only succeeded in financing a small {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} jetty.<ref name=E24>Emery (p.24)</ref> The Bournemouth Improvement Act of 1856 granted greater financial autonomy to the town and a pier was approved that year.

[[File:Entrance to the pier, Bournemouth, England, 1890s.jpg|thumb|[[Photochrom]] of the entrance to the pier, 1890s]]
The arrival of the railways in 1870 precipitated a massive growth in seaside and summer visitors to the town, especially from the [[Midlands]] and London. In 1880 the town had a population of 17,000, but by 1900, when railway connections to Bournemouth were at their most developed, the town's population had risen to 60,000 and it had become a favourite location for visiting artists and writers.<ref name=AA6/> The town was improved greatly during this period through the efforts of Sir [[Merton Russell-Cotes]], the town's mayor and a local philanthropist, who helped to establish the town's first library and museum. The [[Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum]] was housed in his mansion, and after his death, it was given to the town.<ref>Ashley and Ashley (p.22)</ref> Bournemouth became a [[municipal borough]] in 1890 and a [[county borough]] in 1900.<ref name=AA28/>

As Bournemouth's growth increased in the early 20th century, the town centre spawned theatres, cafés, two [[art deco]] cinemas, and more hotels. [[Bournemouth Corporation Tramways]] was established in 1902, becoming the town's first public transport system. In 1908, a [[1908 Bournemouth Tramway accident|deadly tram crash in the town gardens]] killed 7 people. Other new buildings constructed included the [[Bournemouth War Memorial|war memorial]] in 1921 and the [[Pavilion Theatre, Bournemouth|Bournemouth Pavilion]], the town's concert hall and grand theatre, finished in 1925.

The [[Bournemouth Blitz]] saw heavy damage to the town during the [[Second World War]] despite initially escaping heavy bombing. A raid by German [[fighter bomber]]s on 23 May 1943 killed 131 people and damaged 3,359 buildings, with two large hotels being completely destroyed. It is believed that the large number of RAF airmen [[billet]]ed in the town may have been the reason for the attack.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dorsetlife.co.uk/2013/04/a-minute-of-intense-devastation-bournemouths-bloodiest-air-raid/ |title=A minute of intense devastation – Bournemouth's bloodiest air raid |last=Churchill |first=Nick |date=April 2014 |website=www.dorsetlife.co.uk |publisher=Dorset Life Magazine |access-date=27 January 2022 }}</ref> The seafront incurred damage when it was [[British anti-invasion preparations of the Second World War|fortified against invasion]].<ref name=E100>Emery (p.100)</ref> The cast iron lampposts and benches along the front were removed and melted down for munitions, as was much of the superstructure from both Bournemouth and [[Boscombe]] piers before they were breached to prevent their use by enemy ships.<ref name=E100/> The large amounts of barbed wire and anti-tank obstacles along the beach, and the mines at the foot of the [[chine]]s, took two years to remove when peace was finally achieved.<ref name=E102>Emery (p.102)</ref>[[File:Bournemouth, the Waterfront building - geograph.org.uk - 670298.jpg|thumb|The Waterfront Cinema and Leisure Complex (now demolished)]]

From 2000 to 2001 the [[Tesco bomb campaign]] hit the town with a plot to extort money from Supermarket giant [[Tesco]]. Visitors to the town plummeted during the campaign, especially after a bomb exploded at an elderly woman's home after she opened a letter sent by the bomber. During the eight months, over seven bombs were found by [[Dorset Police]], ranging from small letter bombs, to pipe bombs and parcel bombs. The culprit was found to be Robert Edward Dyer, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s)/no by-line.--> |date=11 June 2001 |title=Tesco blackmail 'bomber' jailed |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1383121.stm |work=BBC News |access-date=27 January 2022}}</ref>

{{Main|Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council}}
There is one tier of local government covering Bournemouth, at [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority]] level: [[Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council]], which is based at the [[Bournemouth Town Hall|Civic Centre]] (formerly known as Bournemouth Town Hall) on Bourne Avenue in Bournemouth.

===Administrative history===
The area that is now Bournemouth was historically mostly within the [[ancient parish]] of [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]] in Hampshire. A [[chapel of ease]] was established at [[Holdenhurst]] to serve the west of the parish, and the [[chapelry]] of Holdenhurst subsequently came to be treated as a separate [[civil parish]] from medieval times.<ref name=Holdenhurst>{{cite book |last1=Youngs |first1=Frederic |title=Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England: Volume 1 |date=1979 |publisher=Royal Historical Society |location=London |isbn=0901050679 |page=210}}</ref>

When the development of Bournemouth began in 1810, the site straddled the parishes of Holdenhurst and Christchurch. An [[ecclesiastical parish]] of Bournemouth was created in 1845, but for civil purposes the town continued to straddle the parishes of Holdenhurst and Christchurch.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Youngs |first1=Frederic |title=Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England: Volume 1 |date=1979 |publisher=Royal Historical Society |location=London |isbn=0901050679 |page=199}}</ref> A body of [[improvement commissioners]] was established in 1856 to provide local government services in the town.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bournemouth Improvement Act 1856 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Vict/19-20/90/contents/enacted |website=legislation.gov.uk |publisher=The National Archives |access-date=29 June 2024}}</ref>

Bournemouth was incorporated as a [[municipal borough]] in 1890. In 1900 it was elevated to the status of a [[county borough]], making it independent from [[Hampshire County Council]], whilst remaining part of the [[Ceremonial counties of England#Geographical counties 1889–1974|geographical county]] of Hampshire. The borough boundaries were enlarged on several occasions, notably in 1901 when it absorbed [[Pokesdown]], [[Southbourne, Dorset|Southbourne]] and [[Winton, Dorset|Winton]], and in 1931 when it absorbed Holdenhurst and [[Kinson]] (the latter being transferred from Dorset to Hampshire on its absorption into Bournemouth).<ref>{{cite web |title=Bournemouth Municipal Borough / County Borough |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10042264 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=29 June 2024}}</ref> In 1921 the borough council bought the former Mont Dore Hotel on Bourne Avenue, which had been completed in 1885, and converted into the Town Hall.<ref>{{NHLE|desc=Former Town Hall, BCP Civic Centre, Bourne Avenue|num=1389612|grade=II}}</ref>

The county borough of Bournemouth was reconstituted as a [[non-metropolitan district]] in 1974 under the [[Local Government Act 1972]]. The district kept the same boundaries, but was transferred from Hampshire to Dorset, it being considered desirable that the whole of the [[South East Dorset conurbation]] should be in the same county.<ref name="AA28" /><ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=si|si=The English Non-metropolitan Districts (Definition) Order 1972|year=1972|number=2039|access-date=29 June 2024}}</ref> Bournemouth's [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]] was transferred to the new district, allowing the council to take the name [[Bournemouth Borough Council]] and giving the chair of the council the title of mayor, continuing Bournemouth's series of mayors dating back to 1890.<ref>{{cite web |title=District Councils and Boroughs |url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/written-answers/1974/mar/28/district-councils-and-boroughs#S5CV0871P0_19740328_CWA_145 |website=[[Hansard|Parliamentary Debates (Hansard)]] |access-date=4 December 2021 |date=28 March 1974}}</ref>

On 1 April 1997, Bournemouth Borough Council became a [[unitary authority]], taking over the provision of county council functions from [[Dorset County Council]].<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=si|si=The Dorset (Boroughs of Poole and Bournemouth) (Structural Change) Order 1995|year=1995|number=1771|access-date=29 June 2024}}</ref>

Since the abolition of Bournemouth Borough Council in 2019, Bournemouth has had [[charter trustees]], being the BCP councillors representing wards in the former borough of Bournemouth. The trustees preserve the town's civic charters and traditions, including appointing one of their number each year to serve as mayor.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bournemouth's Charter Trustees |url=https://www.bcpcouncil.gov.uk/about-the-council/civic-dignitaries/charter-trustees/bournemouths-charter-trustees |website=Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council |access-date=25 June 2024}}</ref>

=== Green belt ===
{{main|South West Hampshire/South East Dorset Green Belt}}
Bournemouth lies at the centre of a [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] region that extends into the wider surrounding counties. It is in place to reduce [[urban sprawl]], prevent the towns in the South East Dorset conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas, and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.<ref name="green-belt"/>

Bournemouth has small areas of green belt within its district to the north and east, mostly along the fringes of the shared border with the Christchurch and East Dorset districts. These cover landscape features and greenfield facilities including the River Stour, [[Stour Valley Way]], Millhams Mead and Stour Valley nature reserves and arboretum, [[Hengistbury Head]], and the small communities of Throop and Holdenhurst.<ref name="green-belt">{{cite web|title=BOURNEMOUTH LOCAL PLAN: CORE STRATEGY Bournemouth Borough Council Adopted October 2012|url=https://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/planningbuilding/CoreStrategyDocuments/Core-Strategy-(1).pdf|website=www.bournemouth.gov.uk|access-date=19 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219031319/https://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/planningbuilding/CoreStrategyDocuments/Core-Strategy-(1).pdf|archive-date=19 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Turbary Park]] is a heathland which is a protected [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Turbary Common|url=https://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/Parks/FindParksGardens/Turbarycommon.aspx|access-date=6 October 2020|website=www.bournemouth.gov.uk}}</ref>

Historically Bournemouth has suffered from negative rates of natural increase and has relied on immigration to maintain population growth. In 2007 however, births exceeded deaths for the first time, and this trend has continued through to 2011.

In 1856, Bournemouth Pier was a simple, wooden jetty. This was replaced by a longer, wooden pier five years later, and a cast-iron structure in 1880.<ref name=NPS2/> Two extensions to the pier in 1894 and 1905, brought the total length to {{convert|305|m|abbr=off}}. After [[World War II]], the structure was strengthened to allow for the addition of a Pier Theatre, finally constructed in 1960. This survived until the 2000s when it was turned into a climbing adventure centre. Between 1979 and 1981, a £1.7 million redevelopment programme, saw a great deal of reconstruction work, and the addition of a large two-storey, octagonal-shaped entrance building.<ref name=NPS2/>

Built as the Mont Dore Hotel in 1881, [[Bournemouth Town Hall]] was designated a Grade II listed building in 2001.

Bournemouth is known for having only one "street". This is Orchard Street, now a small alley between Commercial Road and Terrace Road. Originally named because it led to an orchard, it pre-dates the build up of the modern town. The 19th century developers thought that names such as Road, Avenue and Drive would be more suitable names, with Street associated with poorer areas of existing towns and cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.greatbritishlife.co.uk/homes-and-gardens/places-to-live/22610521.10-things-probably-didnt-know-bournemouth/|title=10 things you probably didn't know about Bournemouth|website=Great British Life|date=6 February 2020|accessdate=21 August 2023}}</ref>
