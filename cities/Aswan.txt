Aswan is a busy market and tourist centre located just north of the [[Aswan Dam]] on the east bank of the [[Nile]] at the [[cataracts of the Nile|first cataract]]. The modern city has expanded and includes the formerly separate community on the island of [[Elephantine]].

Aswan includes five monuments within the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the [[International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia|Nubian Monuments from Abu Simbel to Philae]]; these are the Old and Middle Kingdom tombs of [[Qubbet el-Hawa]], the town of [[Elephantine]], the [[Unfinished obelisk|stone quarries and Unfinished Obelisk]], the [[:de:Simeonskloster (Assuan)|Monastery of St. Simeon]] and the [[:ar:المقابر الفاطمية (اسوان)|Fatimid Cemetery]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/88 |title = Nubian Monuments from Abu Simbel to Philae |website = UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher = United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization |access-date = 7 September 2021}}</ref> The city's [[Nubian Museum]] is an important archaeological center, containing finds from the [[International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia]] before the [[Aswan Dam]] flooded all of [[Lower Nubia]].

Aswan is the ancient city of '''Swenett''', later known as '''Syene''', which in antiquity was the frontier town of [[Ancient Egypt]] facing the south. [[Taweret|Swenett]] is supposed to have derived its name from an Egyptian goddess with the same name.<ref name= altas>{{cite book|last1 = Baines|first1 = John|last2 = Malek|first2 = Jaromir|title = Atlas of Ancient Egypt (Cultural Atlas)|publisher = Facts On File Inc|date = March 1983|location = New York, NY|page = [https://archive.org/details/atlasofancienteg00bain/page/240 240]|isbn = 9780871963345|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/atlasofancienteg00bain/page/240}}</ref> This goddess later was identified as [[Eileithyia]] by the Greeks and [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]] by the Romans during their occupation of Ancient Egypt because of the similar association of their goddesses with childbirth, and of which the import is "the opener". The ancient name of the city also is said to be derived from the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] symbol for "trade",<ref>{{Cite book|title=Muhafazat Al Gumhuriya Al Arabiya Al Mutaheda wa Asaraha al baqiah fi al asr al islamim|year=1966|author=Suʻād Māhir|publisher=Majlis al-Aʻlá lil-Shuʼūn al-Islāmīyah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEL5GwAACAAJ}}</ref> or "market".<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Egypt, from the Earliest Times to the Persian Conquest|year=1912|author=James Henry Breasted|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofegyptfr00inbrea/page/7 7]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofegyptfr00inbrea|access-date=2015-04-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121211505/http://www.archive.org/details/historyofegyptfr00inbrea|archive-date=2011-11-21|url-status=live}}</ref>

Because the [[Ancient Egyptians]] oriented themselves toward the origin of the life-giving waters of the Nile in the south, and as Swenett was the southernmost town in the country, [[Egypt]] always was conceived to "open" or begin at Swenett.<ref name= altas/> The city stood upon a peninsula on the right (east) bank of the [[Nile]], immediately below (and north of) the first cataract of the flowing waters, which extended to it from [[Philae]]. Navigation to the delta was possible from this location without encountering a barrier.

The [[stone quarries of ancient Egypt]] located here were celebrated for their stone, and especially for the granitic rock called [[syenite]]. They furnished the colossal statues, [[obelisk]]s, and monolithic shrines that are found throughout Egypt, including the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]]; and the traces of the quarrymen who worked in these 3,000 years ago are still visible in the native rock. They lie on either bank of the [[Nile]], and a road, {{convert|6.5|km|abbr=on}} in length, was cut beside them from Syene to [[Philae]].

Swenett was equally important as a military station and for its position on a trade route. Under every dynasty it was a garrison town; and here tolls and customs were levied on all boats passing southwards and northwards. Around 330, the legion stationed here received a bishop from [[Alexandria]]; this later became the [[Coptic Diocese of Syene]].<ref>Dijkstra, J. Harm F.

In September 2018, the Egyptian Antiquities Minister Khaled el-Enany announced that a sandstone [[sphinx]] statue had been discovered at the temple of Kom Ombo. The statue, measuring approximately {{cvt|28|cm}} in width and {{cvt|38|cm}}) in height, probably dates to the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic Dynasty]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Archaeologists discover sphinx in Egyptian temple|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2018/9/17/egypt-archaeologists-discover-sphinx-in-temple-at-aswan|access-date=2020-12-28|website=www.aljazeera.com|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Heffron|first=Claire|date=2018-09-17|title=Archaeologists discover ancient sphinx in Egyptian temple|url=https://www.euronews.com/2018/09/17/archaeologists-discover-ancient-sphinx-in-egyptian-temple|access-date=2020-12-28|website=euronews|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=2018-09-17|title=Egyptian archaeologists find sphinx at Aswan temple|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-45546415|access-date=2020-12-28}}</ref>

Archaeologists discovered 35 mummified remains of Egyptians in a tomb in Aswan in 2019. Italian archaeologist Patrizia Piacentini and El-Enany both reported that the tomb, where the remains of ancient men, women and children were found, dates back to the [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman period]] between 332 BC and 395 AD. While the findings assumed belonging to a mother and a child were well preserved, others had suffered major destruction. Other than the mummies, artifacts including painted funerary masks, vases of bitumen used in mummification, pottery and wooden figurines were revealed. Thanks to the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] on the tomb, it was detected that the tomb belongs to a tradesman named Tjit.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/24/mummified-remains-of-35-ancient-egyptians-found-in-aswan|title=Mummified remains of 35 ancient Egyptians found in Aswan|last=Giuffrida|first=Angela|date=2019-04-24|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-07-25|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190725203757/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/24/mummified-remains-of-35-ancient-egyptians-found-in-aswan|archive-date=2019-07-25|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/egypt-mummies-aswan-hidden-tomb-scli-intl/index.html|title=At least 34 mummies found in hidden Egyptian tomb|first=Emily |last=Dixon|date=2019-04-25|website=CNN Travel|language=en|access-date=2019-07-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190725203757/https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/egypt-mummies-aswan-hidden-tomb-scli-intl/index.html|archive-date=2019-07-25|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/en/news/sections/culture/2019/04/23/egyptian-necropolis-with-35-mummies-found_b19e4e39-c00d-4069-a42d-528cf82c5ee7.html|title=Egyptian necropolis with 35 mummies found - Culture|date=2019-04-23|website=ANSAMed|language=en|access-date=2019-07-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190725203758/http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/en/news/sections/culture/2019/04/23/egyptian-necropolis-with-35-mummies-found_b19e4e39-c00d-4069-a42d-528cf82c5ee7.html|archive-date=2019-07-25|url-status=live}}</ref>

Piacentini commented "It's a very important discovery because we have added something to the history of Aswan that was missing. We knew about [[tomb]]s and [[Necropolis|necropoli]] dating back to the second and third millennium, but we didn't know where the people who lived in the last part of the Pharaonic era were. Aswan, on the [[Egypt–Sudan border|southern border of Egypt]], was also a very important trading city".<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

Stan Hendrick, [[John Coleman Darnell]] and Maria Gatto in 2012 excavated petroglyphic engravings from Nag el-Hamdulab in Aswan which featured representations of a boat procession, solar symbolism and the earliest depiction of the [[White Crown]] with an estimated dating range between 3200BC and 3100BC.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hendrickx |first1=Stan |last2=Darnell |first2=John Coleman |author2-link=John Coleman Darnell |last3=Gatto |first3=Maria Carmela |title=The earliest representations of royal power in Egypt: the rock drawings of Nag el-Hamdulab (Aswan) |journal=[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]] |date=December 2012 |volume=86 |issue=334 |pages=1068–1083 |doi=10.1017/S0003598X00048250 |s2cid=53631029 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/abs/earliest-representations-of-royal-power-in-egypt-the-rock-drawings-of-nag-elhamdulab-aswan/5DB2326AD5659EF652D1F77C2B713729 |language=en |issn=0003-598X}}</ref>

In February 2021, archaeologists from the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities announced significant discoveries at an archaeological site called Shiha Fort in Aswan, namely a [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic period]] temple, a Roman fort, an early Coptic church and an inscription in [[hieratic]] script. According to [[Mostafa Waziri]], the crumbling temple was decorated with palm leaf carvings and an incomplete sandstone panel that described a Roman emperor. Researcher Abdel Badie states more generally that the church contained ovens used to bake pottery, four rooms, a long hall, stairs, and stone tiles.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ruins Of Ancient Ptolemaic Temple Discovered In Egypt - Greek City Times|date=3 February 2021|url=https://greekcitytimes.com/2021/02/03/ancient-ptolemaic-temple-egypt/|access-date=2021-02-05|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Geggel|first=Laura|title=Ruins of ancient church and temple discovered in Egypt|url=https://www.livescience.com/fort-church-temple-ancient-egypt.html|access-date=2021-02-05|website=livescience.com|date=2 February 2021|language=en}}</ref>

{{More citations needed section|date=June 2011}}

Aswan has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh'') like the rest of Egypt. Aswan and [[Luxor#Climate|Luxor]] have the hottest summer days of any city in [[climate of Egypt|Egypt]]. Aswan is one of the hottest, sunniest and driest cities in the world. Average high temperatures are consistently above {{convert|40|°C|1}} during summer (June, July, August and also September) while average low temperatures remain above {{convert|25|°C|1}}. Average high temperatures remain above {{convert|23|°C|1}} during the coldest month of the year while average low temperatures remain above {{convert|8|°C|1}}. Summers are very prolonged and extremely hot with blazing sunshine although desert heat is dry. Winters are brief and pleasantly mild, though nights may be cool at times.

The climate of Aswan is extremely dry year-round, with less than {{convert|1|mm|2|abbr=on}} of average annual precipitation. The desert city is one of the driest ones in the world, and rainfall does not occur every year; in early 2001, the last rain in Aswan had been seven years earlier. When heavy precipitation does occur, as in a November 2021 rain and hail storm, flash flooding can [[Aswan scorpion invasion|drive scorpions from their lairs]] to deadly effects.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-59274686|title=Egypt: Hundreds stung by scorpions after deadly floods in Aswan|work=BBC News|date=13 November 2021}}</ref> Aswan is one of the least humid cities on the planet, with an average relative humidity of only 26%, with a maximum mean of 42% during winter and a minimum mean of 16% during summer.

The weather of Aswan is extremely clear, bright and sunny year-round in all seasons, with low seasonal variation and almost 4,000 hours of annual sunshine – very close to the maximum theoretical sunshine duration. Aswan is one of the sunniest places on Earth.

The highest record temperature was {{convert|51|°C}} on July 4, 1918, and the lowest record temperature was {{convert|-2.4|°C}} on January 6, 1989.<ref name = meteoclimat/>

== Education ==
In 2012, the [[Aswan University]] was inaugurated, which is headquartered in the city. Aswan is also home to the Aswan Higher Institute of Social Work, which was established in 1975.

== Transport ==
The city is crossed by the [[Cape to Cairo Road]], which connects it to [[Luxor]] and [[Cairo]] to the north, and [[Abu Simbel (village)|Abu Simbel]] and [[Wadi Halfa]] to the south. Also important is the Aswan-[[Berenice]] highway, which connects with the ports of the [[Red Sea]].

Aswan is linked to Cairo by the [[Cape to Cairo Railway]], which also connects it with Wadi Halfa. The railway is incomplete towards the south.

Other key transport infrastructures are the Port of Aswan, the largest river port in the region, and [[Aswan International Airport]].
