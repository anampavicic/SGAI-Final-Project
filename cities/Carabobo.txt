'''Carabobo State''' ({{langx|es|Estado Carabobo}}, {{IPA|es|esˈtaðo kaɾaˈβoβo|IPA}}) is one of the 23 [[States of Venezuela|states]] of [[Venezuela]], located in the north of the country, about two hours by car from [[Caracas]]. The state capital city is [[Valencia, Venezuela|Valencia]], which is also the country's main industrial center. The state's area is {{cvt|4,369|km2}} and as of the 2011 census, had a population of 2,245,744.
[[File:Isla Larga.jpg|thumb|Beach in Carabobo State]]
Carabobo State was the site of the [[Battle of Carabobo]] on 24 June 1821.  This was a decisive win in the war of independence from [[Spain]], and was led by [[Simón Bolívar]].

==Toponymy==
There are several versions about the origin of the name Carabobo. One of them refers to a voice coming from a local Arawaco language: Karau means savannah and bo means water. The repeated bo acts as a superlative, i.e. a lot of water or streams. Thus, Carabobo would mean Savannah of Waters or Savannah of Ravines.<ref>https://www.clubensayos.com/Historia/ORIGEN-HISTORICO-DEL-ESTADO-CARABOBO/996442.html (Spanish)</ref>

== History ==
{{More citations needed section|date=December 2022}}

=== Prehistory ===

==== First cultures ====

When Europeans arrived to what would become Venezuela, one of the most important cultural centres was located around the [[Valencia Lake]]. The Native Americans in the region were hunters, gatherers, but also fishers and farmers. Many [[petroglyph]]s and ceramics remain from this time.

There are signs of human presence in the Valencia region from the fourth millennium BC onwards. Humans were also present earlier in other areas of what is now Carabobo, like in [[Bejuma]].

An important human settlement occurred around the Valencia Lake between 200 and 1000 AD. These people already practiced some kind of agriculture.

==== Second wave ====

At the end of the first millennium new populations started to arrive from the [[Orinoco]] region, probably via the El Pao River.<ref>[http://www.carabobo.gob.ve/municipios2.php?id_municipio=1 Historia de Valencia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406153127/http://www.carabobo.gob.ve/municipios2.php?id_municipio=1 |date=6 April 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.notitarde.com/portadas/ediciones/aniver/aniver2004/huella.html |title=Historia precolombina en Notitarde |access-date=12 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080712064135/http://www.notitarde.com/portadas/ediciones/aniver/aniver2004/huella.html |archive-date=12 July 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> From the eighth century onwards the Orinoco populations started to merge with the older groups. This fusion produced what is known as '''Valenciode culture''' .<ref>[http://www.notitarde.com/portadas/ediciones/aniver/aniver2004/valenciodes.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617010151/http://www.notitarde.com/portadas/ediciones/aniver/aniver2004/valenciodes.html |date=17 June 2008 }} Cultura valencioide, Andrzej Antczak und Ma. Magdalena Mackowiak de Antczak</ref>
People lived in houses built on artificial mounds in the very fruitful valleys to the East and West of the Valencia Lake. They produced specially anthropomorphic sculptures.

Around the year 1200 the Valencioide culture reached the whole area of the Valencia Lake basin, the centre of Northern Venezuela and several islands in the Caribbean. The Indians would trade sea products like the ([[Strombus gigas]]), salt (specially from the Paraguana Peninsula), turtles and fish from coral reefs. The trade took place in villages along the coast.

Taramainas, Tacariguas and other tribes inhabited the Valencia Lake region when the Europeans arrived.
The different groups spoke mostly Arawak languages, but there were also several Carib groups.

The Indians grew maize, a typical product of Western South American cultures and also Manioc, a typical product of groups from the East. Many ''metates'' or grinding stones for maize as well as [[budare]]s for the preparation of cassava remain from those times.

The '''Jirajara''' Indians from Nirgua (now a region between Yaracuy and Carabobo), would go to the Valencia Lake and from there through the mountains to the Sea at the level of Borburata to get salt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://saber.ula.ve/db/ssaber/Edocs/grupos/giecal/publicaciones/monografias/cuaderno2/capitulo3.pdf |title=Inter ethnic relationships of Venezuelan Indians |language=Spanish |access-date=2008-07-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003122238/http://saber.ula.ve/db/ssaber/Edocs/grupos/giecal/publicaciones/monografias/cuaderno2/capitulo3.pdf |archive-date=3 October 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref>

=== European conquest and colonization ===
[[File:Fortín Solano Venezuela.jpg|thumb|Fortín Solano a Spanish military fortress built in 1766]]

==== 15th and 16th centuries ====

Juan de Villegas founded the town of [[Borburata]] in 1548. Seven years later, in 1555, he founded Valencia in the central plains to the west of the Tacarigua (Valencia) Lake.

In 1577 and 1583 the region of Valencia suffered a series of raids by Carib tribes coming from the Low [[Orinoco]]. The Spanish troops led by Garci-González repelled and went after them.

During the late 16th and 17th centuries, the region suffered many [[Piracy in the Caribbean|attacks by French and British pirates]]. The town of Borburata was eventually abandoned for a long period, and settlers moved to Valencia, which was less likely to be raided as it was a day walk from the Caribbean.  Some of the attacks included:

* 1555: French pirates attacked Borburata for 6 days
* 1564: British pirates led by [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] 'forced' the Borburata settlers to buy his cargo, about two hundred Africans from the Gambia region and some European products.
* 1566: Lowell attacked Borburata
* 1567: French pirates led by Nicolas Vallier invaded Borburata and the inhabitants had to abandon the town
* 1568: John Hawkins attacked Borburata again and sold his new cargo of slaves. The main part of that cargo was a group of 400 Africans he had captured and enslaved in Western Africa.

==== 17th century ====

In 1624 Indians to the Northwest of the Valencia Lake established the settlement of Guacara.

Attacks by English and French pirates continued during a great part of the century.  In 1659, the English pirate Myngs plundered [[Puerto Cabello]] on a raid that had taken him to Cumaná and later Coro.<ref>[http://www.monografias.com/trabajos55/piratas-del-caribe/piratas-del-caribe2.shtml Pirates in Venezuela]</ref>
In 1677, Valencia was plundered by French pirates, who burnt down the ''Ayuntamiento'' or "City Hall" and destroyed most historical documents.

At the beginning of 1694, the governor of Venezuela, Francisco Berroterán, declared the growing '''Guacara''', '''Los Guayos'''  and '''San Diego''' ''doctrinas'', "towns of Indians".{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

==== 18th century ====

The [[Compañía Guipuzcoana de Caracas]], a company organized by Basque entrepreneurs, received the monopoly of trade between Venezuela and the rest of the world. In that context, the company built in 1730 the haven of what would become Puerto Cabello.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

In 1800, [[German people|German]] scientist [[Alexander von Humboldt]] explored the area in his South American trip.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

=== Independence war ===
[[File:BatallaCarabobo01.JPG|250px|thumb|Carabobo Battle painted by Tovar y Tovar]]

Venezuela's independence was declared on 19 April 1810 in the Casa de la Estrella, in Valencia. The Independence act was signed there the next year, 5 July.

Several very important battles between Spanish royalist forces and the pro-Independence troops under Bolivar took place in the Carabobo region.  The most important was the [[Battle of Carabobo]], fought on 24 June 1821 and considered a key battle in the struggle for Venezuelan independence.  After the battle, what was left of the Spanish forces holed up in the San Felipe Castle in Puerto Cabello until 10 November 1823, when they surrendered and left Venezuela.

=== Post-colonial times and civil war period ===
On 6 May 1830 the Congress of Valencia takes place. There, Venezuela declared the independence from the Great Colombia and Valencia was declared Venezuela's capital.

On 29 March 1832 the central government created the province of Barquisimeto from a part of Carabobo.

In 1858, during the March Revolution, Valencia became again capital of Venezuela.
[[File:Carabobo_in_Venezuela_(1891).svg|thumb|Carabobo in 1879-1909]]

On 27 April 1881 the central government reforms the administrative divisions and creates the state of Carabobo, which at that time had a part that later was given to Yaracuy.

=== 20th century ===

During [[World War II]], the crews of several Italian ships and one German ship took refuge on the Puerto Cabello bay.  On 31 March 1941, they set fire to their ships to prevent US troops from capturing them. A big fire in the haven of Puerto Cabello ensued. Several hundred marines were captured. Many of the Italians eventually would decide to settle down in Venezuela.
[[File:Naufragio Isla Larga.jpg|thumb|Remains of the German ship "Sesostris" which had taken refuge in Venezuela during the Second World War]]
In the second half of the 20th century, Carabobo experienced a population explosion. Many immigrants arriving from Europe to Venezuela after WW2 settled down in Valencia and surrounding areas. From the 1970s onwards, immigration came mainly from other Latin American countries.  The [[La Cabrera Tunnel]] was constructed in the late 1950s using the [[New Austrian Tunnelling method]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schubert|first1=Wulf|title=Development and Background of NATM|url=http://www.ytmk.org.tr/files/files/01_TUG_NATM.pdf|website=ytmk.org.tr|publisher=Graz University of Technology|pages=14}}</ref>

The first local elections for governors took place in 1988. Salas Römer became elected governor of Carabobo. In 2006 the Valencia city metro was inaugurated, making it the third city in the country with a system of this type.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

== Geography ==

===Geology and Relief===
Most of Carabobo State - 75% - is mountainous and part of the Coastal Range. The highest elevations are found throughout the northern part, in the western part of the state and in the southern part of Lake Valencia.

There is a central depression around Lake Valencia and towards the south the plains begin.
[[File:BAHÍA DE PATANEMO ESTADO CARABOBO. 02.JPG|thumb|Patanemo Bay, Carabobo]]

===Peaks===
Cobalongo or Caobal Hill, in the municipality of Puerto Cabello, in the north, is the highest point in the state, at 1990 meters above sea level. Other of the highest peaks are:

*The summit of the Copa, with 1800 in the Municipality of Montalbán.
*The summit of Borburata, with 1,680 meters above sea level in the Municipality of Puerto Cabello.
*The Carrizo Real with 1.560 masl in the Municipality of Puerto Cabello.
There is a large number of anticlines, synclines, diaclases, fractures and faults. One of the most important faults is La Victoria, located south of Valencia. This area shows some tectonic activity of moderate importance.

The mountains have very deep slopes. The slopes can exceed 80%. In the plains, the slopes are less than 1%. In the area of the Tocuyito high plateau the slopes reach 5%.

In the State of Carabobo, in front of Puerto Cabello there are a number of small islands:

*Larga Island: it is the largest, with 1855 m long. It is currently part of the San Esteban National Park.
*Santo Domingo Island: it is an island of 463 m at about 928 m west of Isla Larga.
*Ratón Island: it is an islet surrounded by corals at 1390 m southwest of Isla Santo Domingo and 230 m from the mainland.
*Del Rey Island: with 463 m long, is surrounded by corals and reefs.

In Lake Valencia there are also several islands. Some have disappeared due to the rise in the level of the lake since the 1970s. The largest island is [[Burro Island]].

===Hydrography===
The State of Carabobo has three hydrographic basins: the Basin of the Caribbean Sea, the Basin of Lake Valencia and the Basin of the South.
[[File:Atardecer en el malecón de Puerto Cabello.JPG|thumb|The coast of the state of Carabobo in the Caribbean Sea]]

====Caribbean Basin====
Rivers:

*Aguas Calientes
*Borburata
*Goaigoaza
*Moron
*Patanemo
*Sanchón
*San Esteban: this river rises at the top called Tetas de Hilaria, passes through the town of San Esteban and flows eastwards from Puerto Cabello.
*Urama: the river has its source in the mountains of the Canoabo area and runs for about 62 kilometers.
These rivers generally flow from the northern part of the Coastal Mountain Range into the Caribbean Sea.

====Basin of Lake Valencia====
[[File:WP 000063.jpg|thumb|Valencia Lake]]
Rivers:

*Cabriales River, crosses Valencia from north to south.
*Güigüe River, flows into the south of Valencia Lake.
*Guacara River, flows into the northern shore of Lake Valencia
* Los Guayos River, which flows into the north shore of Valencia Lake, is in danger of disappearing.
All these rivers used to flow into Lake Valencia, although the waters of the Cabriales River have been diverted to the Paíto.

====Basin of the South====
Rivers:

*Pao River
*Manaure River
These rivers flow into the Guárico and Portuguesa rivers, which are part of the Orinoco River basin.

=== Terrain and soil ===
Most of the region is covered by mountains that make up part of Venezuela's Coast Mountain Range.  The highest peaks are found on the north and west of the state and south of the [[Valencia Lake]].  The Cobalongo or Caobal peak is the highest point of the state, at 1990 metres above sea level.
[[File:Playa quizandal (Pto Cabello - Carabobo).jpg|thumb|Quizandal Beach, Carabobo State]]
There is a central low plain around the Valencia Lake and towards the south, where Venezuela's Llanos start.

There is a large amount of anticlinals, synclinals, diaclases, [[fracture (geology)|fractures]] and [[geological fault|faults]]. One of the most important is the one of the Victoria, south of Valencia. This area has moderate [[tectonic]] activity.

Mountains are very steep; some slopes are over 80%. On the plains, slopes are less than 1%. In the Tocuyito area, slopes can reach 5%.

There are a group of small [[island]]s near Puerto Cabello. The main ones are Isla Larga, Isla Santo Domingo, Isla Alcatraz and Isla del Rey. Isla Larga is the largest and is 1855 metres long. It makes part of the [[San Esteban National Park]].

There are also a couple of islands on Lake Valencia. Some more have disappeared after the rise in [[sea level]] since the 1970s. ''Isla del Burro'' ("Donkey Island") is the largest island of the lake.

Carabobo's soils are fertile. [[Entisol]] soils predominate (above all [[fluvent]]s and [[orthent]]s). There are also threats of [[vertisol]]s with suborders of usterts.

=== Fauna ===
The fauna of Carabobo mainly inhabits the tropical forests, grassland surrounding and mountainous landscapes. Though a richly inhabited land, the pollution of many of its lakes and rivers has caused the wildlife of Carabobo to be transformed and mutilated, adapting itself in order to survive. The vast majority of wildlife that remains is predominately birds due to their ability to be able to fly in search of cleaner water.
[[File:BAHÍA DE PATANEMO ESTADO CARABOBO. 06.JPG|thumb|Flamingos are one of the bird species that can be found in the State of Carabobo]]
Typical fauna include the Frilled Dragon, Carabobo Tree Frogs and Valencia Piscavi.

Wild birds such as the Sugar Glider, Olive-backed Oriole, Whip-tail, Poonbill, Scrub Mullet and Mopoke.

Insects such as Forest Floor Skink are commonly found.

===Vegetation===
The State of Carabobo presents a predominantly tropical vegetation. Among the most typical species are carob trees, apamates, camorucos, caobas, cedars, guamos, carabobo palms, samanes, among others. On the coast you can find mangroves like the red Rhizophora mangle, as well as beach grapes (Coccoloba uvifera) and coconut trees (Cocos nucifera).
[[File:Isla Larga colorida.jpg|thumb|Isla Larga (Long Island), Carabobo]]
Alexander von Humboldt reported that in 1800 there were still large numbers of Araguatos in the forests south of Valencia. He also mentioned the presence of caimans (Caiman crocodilus) in Lake Valencia, which do not exist there today. Already by that time Alexander von Humboldt mentioned that the lake's shores, which had been covered with forests at the time of the beginning of European colonization, were treeless.

===Parks, Green Zones and Zoos===

*[[San Esteban National Park]]: located south of Puerto Cabello and north of the Municipality of Naguanagua, the Municipality of San Diego and the Municipality of Guacara, (the latter three municipalities belonging to the Valencia Metropolitan Area).

The garden has been developed through successive plantings and maintenance in which members of the university community have participated.
*Guataparo Dam: (known as Dique de Guataparo), located northwest (NW) of the city of Valencia, was initially contemplated as a water supplier to the capital of the Caribbean just before the industrialization process. At present, it represents a compensatory reserve of drinking water. Over time it has become a tourist attraction because of the natural beauty of the surrounding area, the jungle of fauna and flora found there, made it be decreed a refuge for birds. Nowadays, it is an area of physical and extreme activity.

Agriculture is concentrated to the north and south of Lake Valencia, as well as in the western municipalities (Bejuma, Miranda and Montalbán). In total there are some 79,450 ha used for agriculture at present.
The soils around Lake Valencia are highly productive. Unfortunately, in the northern part of the lake many agricultural areas give way to the construction of urbanizations, even though they are under protection.
Among the main agricultural products are: [[Maize|corn]], [[Legume|grain legumes]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[tobacco]], [[cotton]], [[Sugarcane|sugar cane]], [[vegetable]]s, [[coconut]] and fish products.
In the State of Carabobo there are also forest resources such as [[Carob|carob tree]], apamate, camoruco, [[mahogany]], [[The Cedar Tree|cedar]] and guamo Saman.

Carabobo is the second largest producer of [[Chicken as food|chicken]] in Venezuela.
Cattle and [[pig farming]] is important. Many of the farms in this sector are located in the southern zone of Lake Valencia ([[Diego Ibarra Municipality]], [[San Joaquín Municipality, Carabobo|San Joaquin Municipality]]) and in the western part of the state. Currently, the Venezuelan government is developing a bilateral agreement with [[Argentina]] to increase cattle breeding in the aforementioned geographical area and thus contribute to boosting cattle development in Venezuela.

Among the mineral resources are: [[Clay|ceramic clay]], [[sand]], [[Diatomaceous earth|diatomite]], [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]], [[marble]] and [[Serpentine subgroup|serpentine]].

===Petrochemicals===

====Moron Petrochemical Complex====
Venezuela's main [[petrochemical industry]] is located in the state of Carabobo, specifically on the western coast of the state, (Morón), in the [[Morón Petrochemical Complex|Petrochemical Complex]] of [[Morón, Venezuela|Morón]] (the largest in the country). In this complex is the company [[Petroquímica de Venezuela]] ([[Pequiven]]), a [[PDVSA]] subsidiary, which is dedicated to the production and commercialization of petrochemical products with export capacity, but giving priority to the domestic market.

The three main business line products on which the corporation is based, which offers more than 40 petrochemical products to the national and international markets, are [[Fertilizer]]s, industrial chemicals and [[Alkene|olefins]] and [[Microplastics|plastic resins]].

====[[El Palito Refinery]]====

The El Palito refinery is one of the largest oil refining complexes in Venezuela. It is located in the municipality of Puerto Cabello, near the town of El Palito, on the coast of the state of Carabobo, in Venezuela. It currently has a maximum processing capacity of 140,000 barrels of crude oil per day.31 This complex, controlled by the company [[PDVSA|Petróleos de Venezuela]] (PDVSA), supplies fuel and derivatives to the central-western part of the country through a system of polyducts that supply the El Palito, Yagua and Barquisimeto distribution plants.

The El Palito refinery complex was the first refinery complex in Venezuela with electricity self-management and synchronous interconnection with the national electricity system. It is also where unleaded and oxygenated gasoline production began for the first time and where catalytic reforming was incorporated for the first time and where both the [[benzene]], [[toluene]] and [[O-Xylene|ortho-xylene]] (BTX) plant and the electrostatic precipitator were installed.

==Transport==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2022}}
The State of Carabobo is connected to the rest of the country through a network of highways and roads maintained by the National Government and INVIAL. Due to problems in calculating the speed of population growth and the lack of projects aimed at the long-term development of the city of Valencia, both the streets and the main highways and avenues throughout the state are constantly congested. Carabobeños, in order to find out about the state of traffic on the Autopista Regional del Centro (ARC) that connects Valencia to other cities, listen to the Victoria FM 103.9 radio station and read the reports of the passers-by themselves on social networks such as [[Twitter]]. The city has various cameras at different points on its road sections, especially on the main avenues and motorways in the town, and these videos can be seen on the website of El Carabobeño, one of the city's main newspapers.

===Highways and roads===

The State of Carabobo has one of the best road networks in the country. Among them, the following stand out:

*Trunk 1 or Regional Highway of the center (ARC) or also called Highway [[Caracas]] - Valencia, which connects all the Great Valencia and great part of the Carabobo State with the rest of the [[Central Region, Venezuela|Central Region of Venezuela]] like the cities of Maracay, Caracas, adjacent zones, and with the east of the country. This motorway is the busiest and most important road in Venezuela.
*Guacara - Bárbula Variant Highway, which connects the Central Regional Highway in its section of Guacara with the municipalities of San Diego, Naguanagua and Los Guayos and continues north on the Valencia - Puerto Cabello Highway. It receives the identification Ramal 1 and Local 001.
* Autopista Circunvalación del Este: continuation of the Autopista Regional del Centro, and goes from the centre of Valencia to the north and Naguanagua. It ends at the Bárbula Distributor and continues to the east with the Variante and to the northwest with the Valencia - Puerto Cabello Highway.
*Valencia - Puerto Cabello Highway: it connects the north of Valencia and Naguanagua with Puerto Cabello and extends towards San Felipe, Barquisimeto and the rest of the west and forms a continuation of the East Ring Road and the Variante and, like these, receives the Trunk 1 identifier.
*Valencia - Campo Carabobo Highway, which becomes highway number 5 and connects Valencia with Tinaquillo and from there with the west of Venezuela.
* Autopista Circunvalación del Sur: also known as the Southern Highway, it joins the center and south of the Municipality of Valencia, where most of the city's population is concentrated. It starts from the San Blas Distributor, where it joins the Autopista Regional del Centro and the Autopista Circunvalación del Este, with which it has a clear continuity. Its distributors are simple, and allow access to important avenues in the city. These are the Michelena Distributor (access to Avenida Michelena), Los Samanes Distributor (access to Avenida Circunvalación de los Samanes), El Palotal Distributor (access to Avenida Las Ferias also called Avenida Bolivar Sur), and the Aranzazu Distributor (access to Avenida Aranzazu). After this, the highway continues, with numerous accesses of lesser importance and crossing the Libertador Municipality, until it divides and forms the José Antonio Páez Highway, which communicates the city with the western plains; and the road that allows access to the populations of the high valleys of the city.
*José Antonio Páez Highway: also known as the Llanos Highway, it communicates the states of Barinas, Carabobo, Cojedes and Portuguesa. The highway is still under construction, however several sections have already been opened. It begins in the city of Valencia at the height of the Campo de Carabobo, reaching the Distributor Guanapa in the city of Barinas.
*National Road Valencia - Maracay: It integrates the urban area to the north of the Lake of Valencia, Los Guayos, Guacara, San Joaquin and Mariara, until arriving at Maracay, in the State of Aragua. It receives the Local 001 identifier until Guacara, and from Guacara to Valencia is the Local 006.
*Morón - Coro road (Trunk 3) that goes from Morón and from there to Coro and Maracaibo along the coast.
The Trunk 11 that goes from Chivacoa, Cojedes State, passing by the Municipality of Miranda and Valencia, continuing along the south of Valencia Lake to Güigüe and from there to Villa de Cura, in Aragua State.
*Local Road 004: runs through the west of Carabobo and joins Urama with Bejuma.

===Air Transport===
The State of Carabobo has [[List of airports in Venezuela|two airports]]: one in the capital city of Carabobo (Valencia) and the other in [[Puerto Cabello Airport|Puerto Cabello]].

The State of Carabobo is connected with other cities and states in the country and other countries through the [[Arturo Michelena International Airport]], located in the heart of the industrial zone, southeast of the city of Valencia. It is the second airport in order of importance in the country. It is also the most important airport in the country in terms of the volume of goods transported, occupying 60% of the nation's air cargo. Each year it receives more than 150,000 passengers, in addition to being the boarding point for more than 160,000 national and international travelers.43 According to the [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] Airport Code corresponding to Arturo Michelena Airport, the acronym "VLN" is the identifying symbol of the city, both nationally and internationally. It was planned and built by the administration of Social Democratic President [[Jaime Lusinchi]] and Carabobo Governor [[Oscar Celli Gerbasi]]. The first plane to officially land at the Arturo Michelena terminal was [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|a DC-9]] from [[Aeropostal Alas de Venezuela|Aeropostal]] called "El Margariteño".

The [[General Bartolomé Salom Airport]] in the city of Puerto Cabello. It provides its services efficiently to the community. It has a single two-storey building of modern style, with a series of square windows that are repeated on the upper level and on the lower level with glass doors. It has a control tower, a waiting room, administrative offices, bullfighting facilities, restrooms, travelers' services area, parking lot and green areas. It has been providing services since 1953. It was extensively renovated by the Social Democratic president, [[Raúl Leoni]], as part of the works carried out on the Carabobo coast, including the Valencia-Puerto Cabello road.

===Valencia Metro===

The State of Carabobo has the National Metro System in the capital city of the state (Valencia) called [[Valencia Metro (Venezuela)|Metro de Valencia]] inaugurated in 2006. It currently has the following stations:
[[File:Estacion monumental del metro de valencia.jpg|thumb|[[List of Valencia, Venezuela metro stations|Monumental station, Valencia Metro]]]]
*[[Monumental station (Valencia)|Monumental station]]
*[[Las Ferias station]]
*[[Palotal station]]
*[[Santa Rosa station (Carabobo)|Santa Rosa station]]
*[[Michelena station]]
*[[Lara station]]
*[[Cedeño station]]
*[[Rafael Urdaneta station]]
*[[Miranda station (Valencia)|Francisco de Miranda station]]

The [[Valencia Metro (Venezuela)|Valencia Metro]] is also being expanded with [[List of Valencia, Venezuela metro stations|5 new stations]] currently under construction. Metro de Valencia will have 2 intermodal stations for its interconnection with the [[State Railways Institution|National Railway System]], in the Simón Bolívar station of the University of Carabobo ([[Naguanagua Municipality|Naguanagua]]) and in the Castillito Industrial Zone (San Diego).

===National Railway System===
The railway section that will link the city of Valencia with Maracay and Caracas is currently under construction. The central section Ezequiel Zamora II (Puerto Cabello - La Encrucijada) of the [[State Railways Institution|National Railway System]] is the fundamental axis of the system, designed for passengers and cargo. It provides an interconnection between the state capital (Valencia) and the Eje Industrial Este, and in turn with Puerto Cabello. In this way, the Metropolitan Area of Valencia is consolidated and extended towards the most populated urban axes of the State; and the cohesion on a larger scale of all the urban areas of the Central Region. In Carabobo, the section has 6 stations: [[Puerto Cabello Municipality|Puerto Cabello]], [[Naguanagua Municipality|Naguanagua]], [[San Diego, Carabobo|San Diego]], [[Guacara]], [[San Joaquín, Carabobo|San Joaquin]], [[Mariara]] and an interport in San Diego.

In addition, there is currently a freight train track with little traffic from the West (departing from [[Barquisimeto]]) to Puerto Cabello. This railroad and its stations are being rehabilitated as part of the Simon Bolivar West Central Section (Passengers and Cargo), from [[Puerto Cabello]] to [[San Felipe, Yaracuy|San Felipe]] (Yaracuy), [[Barquisimeto]] (Lara), [[Acarigua]] and Turen (Portuguesa).

===Surface Public Transport===
Public transport is mostly composed of small buses and buses belonging to cooperatives or institutes attached to the municipalities. This public transport system is quite criticized due to the constant violations of traffic regulations and for not respecting the areas designated for the entry or discharge of passengers. Currently, the TransCarabobo Mass Transport System is in place with several routes throughout the city.

In order to find a solution to this problem, in conjunction with the completion of the second section of Line 1 of the [[Valencia Metro (Venezuela)|Valencia Metro]] (Av. Bolivar Norte stage), there are plans to introduce a Metrobus45 system to complement the surface transport network by connecting various areas of the city with the Valencia metro stations.

===TransCarabobo===
The [[Carabobo Mass Transit System]], or simply [[TransCarabobo]], is a mass transit system in the State of Carabobo in Venezuela, especially in the cities of Valencia, Guacara, Puerto Cabello and Naguanagua. It is of the BRT type. It was inaugurated on 11 July 2014 in the hands of the Government of President [[Nicolás Maduro|Nicolas Maduro]] as part of the Transport Mission, it started operating the same day with two routes only in the city of Valencia. Later new routes were added in the cities of Guacara, Puerto Cabello and Naguanagua.

TransCarabobo has a central station located adjacent to the Parque Recreacional del Sur, where the unit and workshop yard is located and from where the two trunk lines depart. By April 2015 new routes will be activated in the municipalities of [[Carlos Arvelo Municipality|Carlos Arvelo]], [[Los Guayos Municipality|Los Guayos]], [[Diego Ibarra Municipality|Diego Ibarra]] and [[Libertador Municipality, Carabobo|Libertador]].

===Interstate Public Transportation===
Bus services to other cities are provided from the Big Low Center Passenger Terminal, located in the municipality of San Diego to the east of the city of Valencia. From this terminal all buses depart to the main cities of the country, such as [[Caracas]], [[Maracaibo]], [[Barquisimeto]], [[Puerto Cabello]], [[Maracay]], [[Ciudad Bolívar]], [[Maturín]], [[Puerto la Cruz|Puerto La Cruz]], [[Barcelona, Venezuela|Barcelona]], [[Ciudad Guayana|Puerto Ordaz]], [[Coro, Venezuela|Coro]], [[Mérida, Mérida|Mérida]], [[San Cristóbal, Táchira|San Cristóbal]], [[Punto Fijo]], [[Tucacas]], [[Chichiriviche]], [[San Carlos, Cojedes|San Carlos]], [[Los Teques]], [[Barinas, Barinas|Barinas]], [[San Juan de los Morros]], [[Guanare]], among others.
[[File:Atardecer Playa Sonrisa Puerto Cabello..jpg|thumb|Puerto Cabello is one of the most important ports in Venezuela]]
At present, a new and modern land passenger terminal is being built, the Valencia Metropolitan Terminal, or also called San Diego Tourist Terminal, located in the [[Castillito Industrial Zone]] right in front of the current Big Low Center Terminal. This will be one of the largest and most moderate land passenger terminals in Venezuela, and will have hotel services, food fairs, and a shopping center, among other things.

===Aquatic Transportation===
The State of Carabobo has the largest and most important port in Venezuela, [[Puerto Cabello]]. Historically, it has been one of the most important since the colonial era, due to its location and natural characteristics, since the beginning of the 21st century, driven by the growing industrial development of the State of Carabobo.

Currently, Lake Valencia only has terminals and boats for private use.
