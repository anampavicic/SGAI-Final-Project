== History ==
Historically, Bilaspur was part of [[Dakshina Kosala]] and was near capital of [[Malhar, Chhattisgarh]] (ancient Mallar), Sirpur (ancient Shripura), Tuman (ancient Tummana), and Ratanpur (ancient Ratnapura). From 5th Century onwards it was controlled by the [[Kalachuris of Ratnapura|Kalachuri dynasty]] of [[Ratanpur]]. [[Ratanpur]] was historical capital of [[Chhattisgarh]] state for many different dynasty. Bilaspur city, however, came into prominence around 1741, the year of the [[Maratha Empire]] rule, when a Maratha official took up his abode there to control dynasty of [[Ratanpur]].

The management of Bilaspur district was taken over by the [[British East India Company]]  in 1818 after [[Bhosale]] lost territory in [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]]. Under Bhosale of the Nagpur kingdom there were many subedars or zamindars/landlords like Akbar Khan, Vazeer Khan, Sao and others in Bilaspur.

Bilaspur district was constituted in 1861, followed by Bilaspur municipality in 1867.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History {{!}} District Bilaspur {{!}} India |url=https://bilaspur.gov.in/en/about-district/history/ |access-date=2022-03-21 |language=en-US |archive-date=23 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123124/https://bilaspur.gov.in/en/about-district/history/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Famines in the Bilaspur district were recorded by the British administration in 1828–9, 1834–5, 1845–6, 1868–9 and 1899–1900. In 1868-9 and 1899–1900, the rains failed almost completely, resulting in severe distress, migration and desertion of villages. After the 1868-9 famine there was prosperity for the next 25 years; but in 1895 there was a very poor harvest, followed in 1896 by a complete failure of crops, and severe famine continued throughout 1897. In that year the mortality rate was as high as one in six people. The famine of 1897 was followed by two favorable years; but in 1899 the [[monsoon]] failed completely and the rice crop was wholly destroyed.

[[Satguru Ghasidas|Guru Ghasidas]] (1756–1836) started a religious movement, Satnamis (meaning the worshippers of Satnam(not related to Sikhism), between 1820 and 1830 primarily around the Sonakhan forests. This religious movement preached against idol-worship, and instead stressed that God is synonymous with truth. His community was a farming community. The university at Bilaspur is named after him as [[Guru Ghasidas University]].

Railways arrived at Bilaspur in the decade 1880–90, with the arrival of the [[Bengal Nagpur Railway]]. In 1888 [[Mistri]] Jagmal Gangji and other Mistri Railway Contractors laid the first railway tracks from [[Rajnandgaon]] to Bilaspur, and in that same year fellow [[Kutchi people|Kutchi]] contractor [[Khoda Ramji Chawda|Khoda Ramji]] and others built the line from Bilaspur to [[Jharsuguda]], including the bridge over the Champa river.

In 1890, the present railway station and yard were constructed by the Gujarati railway contractor Jagmal Gangji. His son [[Mulji Jagmal Sawaria]] was later given the title of "Rao Sahib" by the British for his contribution to the development of the town, railways and the district. Jagmal Block and Jagmal Chowk in the city are named after Jagmal Gangji Sawaria.

In 1901, the population of Bilaspur was 18,937 and it was the eighth-largest town in the [[Central Provinces]] of [[British India]]. In 1908, weaving of tasar silk and cotton clothes were recorded as the major industries of Bilaspur.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh.jpg|thumb|Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh]]
Historical records like [https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V08_239.gif ''Imperial Gazetteer of India'', Vol 8, 1908] note that the city is said to be named after a fisherwoman by the name of "Bilasa" in the 17th century, and for a long period it consisted only of a few fishermen's huts. Another book like [''The highlands of central India'', James Forsyth, 1889] states that Bilaspur is named after 'Palash' tree [[butea frondosa]] which are found in abundance in the area. In [[Sanskrit]] Bilas means playful or enjoyment and Pur means city or town. So, literally Bilaspur mean the city of enjoyment.

For this, the Government has constituted a ‘Special Area Development Authority’ (SADA) for the development of the Arpa river bank near Bilaspur city.

The Government has invited proposals from interested national and international institutions for the development of the river bank on a PPP model. The Authority has prepared a project for the development of the river and is now in search of organisations that would be interested in developing the river on a Public Private Partnership (PPP).

According to SADA, about 653 hectares of area on the banks of the river would be developed. This area is 13.4&nbsp;km in length. Commercial, residential, entertainment and other institutional facilities would be developed in this area. On both the sides of the river, 13.4-km-long retaining wall, houses and commercial complexes would be constructed, besides bridge, roads and walkways. Water supply, sewerage, drainage, electricity supply would be provided in the area.

The estimated cost of all the works is Rs2,000 crore. The development works would be taken up in phases during the next seven years.

Of the total 653-hectare area, some of the land is owned privately. In lieu of acquisition of private land, the affected people would be given land at other areas. After development about 267 hectares of land will be made available for sale. By selling this land, the developer could recover the invested amount. The downtown is called Gol Bazaar (Circular Market). Gol Bazaar, Sadar Bazaar and company Garden Chowk are buzzing and vibrant but overcrowded with slow-moving traffic. In contrast there are some newly developed areas as well. The Vyapar Vihar is a newly developed commercial and goods transport area. Bilaspur has Chhattisgarh's first hi-tech bus stand at Bodri.
