'''Zulia State''' ({{langx|es|Estado Zulia}}, {{IPA|es|esˈtaðo ˈsulja|IPA}}; [[Wayuu language|Wayuu]]: ''Mma’ipakat Suuria'') is one of the [[States of Venezuela|23 states]] of [[Venezuela]]. The state capital is [[Maracaibo]]. As of the 2011 census, it has a population of 3,704,404, the largest population among Venezuela's states. It is also one of the few states (if not the only one) in Venezuela in which [[voseo]] (the use of ''vos'' as a second person singular pronoun) is widespread. The state is coterminous with the eponymous [[Regions of Venezuela|region]] of [[Zulian Region, Venezuela|Zulia]].

Zulia State is in northwestern Venezuela, bordering [[Lake Maracaibo]], the largest body of water of its kind in [[Latin America]]. Its basin covers one of the largest oil and gas reserves in the [[Western Hemisphere]].

Zulia is economically important to the country for its oil and mineral exploitation, but it is also one of the major agricultural areas of Venezuela, highlighting the region's contribution in areas such as livestock, [[banana]]s, fruits, meat, and milk.

==Toponymy==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
There are several competing theories about the origin of the state's name. One is that Guaimaral, son of the [[cacique]] Mara, was on pilgrimage in the [[Pamplona, Colombia|Pamplona]] region, where he fell in love with the beautiful Zulia, but she was killed in a battle against the conquerors. Gaimaral sadly returned to his father's domains, naming rivers, towns and regions for his lost love there is little historical proof, but that is the most popular theory.

==History==
{{More citations needed|date=January 2023}}

=== Before Colonization ===
Indigenous peoples have been living in the region for a long time, including [[Yukpa people|Yukpa]], [[Barí people|Barí]], [[Arawak|Arawakos (Western),]] [[Timoto–Cuica people|Timotes and Cuica]], [[Caquetio|Caquetío]], [[Wayuu people|Wayúu]], and [[:es:Pueblo_añú|Añú]] (es).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Welcome |url=https://native-land.ca/ |access-date=2024-10-06 |website=Native-Land.ca |language=en}}</ref>

=== Spanish Colonization ===
The area that is now Zulia was first seen by Europeans in 1499 during an expedition commanded by [[Alonso de Ojeda]]. Transferred by the Crown of Spain to German Businessmen (to the banking company of the Welsers of Augsburg), in 1527, the Governorship and lands of the Province of Venezuela, was its factor and governor of: the Province Ambrosio Dalfinger, the first conqueror of those regions.

His expedition from Coro to Maracaibo around 1528 and 1529 and the one he carried out at the end of 1529 along the eastern shore of the lake up to the mouth of the Motatán river, were the first occasions, after the discovery, in which they made contact
the Europeans with the Indians living in Lake Maracaibo. These risky enterprises, for which a great deal of value and energy was required, were interesting subjects that inspired the chronicler Juan de Castellanos much of his poetic work concluded by the year
of 1590 under the title of "Elegies of Illustrious Men of the Indies.

During the Spanish colonial period, its lands were part of the [[Venezuela Province]] until 1676, when its lands were added to the [[Mérida Province (Spanish Empire)|Province of Mérida del Espiritu Santo de la Grita]],<ref name=histdic>[https://books.google.com/books?id=uyqepNdgUWkC&dq=Province+of+Merida+del+Espiritu+Santo+de+la+Grita&pg=PA406 Dictionary of European Imperialism]</ref> becoming the province ''Espiritu Santo de Maracaibo'', or [[Maracaibo Province (Spanish Empire)|Maracaibo Province]].<ref name=EspSanto>{{in lang|es}} [http://barinas.tsj.gov.ve/informacion_general.asp?id=005 Venezuela Barinas supreme court Historic references]</ref>

[[File:Iglesia Santa Barbara I.jpg|300px|thumb|Santa Barbara Church was completed in 1888]]
The territory that covers the State of Zulia was erected in the Province of Maracaibo in the year of 1678 and was added, along with Mérida, to the [[Viceroyalty of the New Granada|Viceroyalty of the New Kingdom of Granada]]. It is entity was governed by the President of the Court, whose official seat was the city of Santa Fé de Bogotá and its jurisdiction extended, in a capricious and extravagant way, to the Provinces of Guayana, Cumaná, Maracaibo and the Islands of Margarita and Trinidad The difficulties that to its good administration offered this curious conglomerate, forced
the Court of [[Madrid]] to modify the primitive division and by Royal Decree of September 8, 1777, the Provinces of Maracaibo, Cumaná, Guayana and the Islands of Margarita and Trinidad were incorporated into the General Captaincy of Caracas.

By Royal Decree of February 15, 1785, the city of Barinas and its dependencies, which corresponded to Maracaibo, were segregated to form a separate province, and instead the city of Trujillo was incorporated, which was part of the province of Caracas. In 1789, the province covered the territory of the current Venezuelan states of Zulia, [[Apure]], [[Barinas (state)|Barinas]], [[Táchira]], [[Mérida (state)|Mérida]] and [[Trujillo (state)|Trujillo]]. In 1810, Mérida and Trujillo were separated as new provinces. At the beginning of the 19th century, the province of Maracaibo had, besides the capital of its name, the cities of Mérida, Trujillo, San Cristobal, El Rosario de Perijá and San Bartolomé de Sinamaica, with their respective dependencies; but once the independence of Mérida, was segregated with the character of a province, while Maracaibo continued under the Spanish regime until January 18, 1821, on which date it joined the [[Great Colombia]], proclaiming its independence from the Government of Madrid.

=== Republican period ===
[[File:Teatro Baralt by Beria.jpg|300px|thumb|The Baralt Theatre was opened in 1883]]
Zulia Province declared independence from Spain on January 28, 1821. During the [[Gran Colombia]] period in 1824, it received the name of "[[Zulia Department]]", honoring the [[Zulia River]]. The Constituent Congress of 1824 divided the territory of Colombia into four departments, one of which was Zulia, composed of the provinces of Coro, Mérida and Maracaibo; but when the Great Colombia was dissolved in 1830, Maracaibo was left with the character of Province composed of its own territory and that of Trujillo. One year later the Trujillo Section was erected in Province, separating definitively from Maracaibo. With the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830, it was named [[Maracaibo Province (Venezuela)|Maracaibo Province]] and was one of the 11 [[provinces of Venezuela]]. In 1835 the territory of the Province of Maracaibo was divided into the five Cantons: Maracaibo, Perijá, Zulia, Gibraltar and Altagracia. By Decree of April 9, 1850 were added. the territory of the Province of Trujillo the parishes of La Ceiba and La Ceibita, belonging to Maracaibo, so that that Andean Province had an exit to the Lake.

[[Constitution of Venezuela|Venezuela's federal constitution]], April 22, 1864, changed the denomination of "province" to "state", creating the State of Maracaibo on the same territory as the province. At the end of the same year, the state's legislation determined to change the name to the Sovereign State of Zulia, but that lasted only a few months.<ref name=histzuliagov>{{in lang|es}} Ernesto Garcia McGregor, Government of Zulia, [http://www.gobernaciondelzulia.gov.ve:80//lista2.asp?sec=120100 History of the Zulia state] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911071944/http://www.gobernaciondelzulia.gov.ve:80//lista2.asp?sec=120100 |date=September 11, 2008 }}</ref> In 1874, its name again became Zulia State. Federal government orders in 1881 created the combined [[Falcón Zulia|Falcón Zulia state]]. Its autonomous state status continued until April 1, 1890, when congress legislated the separation of the Falcon-Zulia State. It suffered further territorial changes towards the end of the 19th century, until the current [[delimitation]] in 1899 was finally drawn. Since that time the name has remained ''Estado Zulia''.

[[File:Médanos de Zapara.jpg|300px|thumb|Médanos de Zapara (Zapara Dunes), desert landscape on the island of San Carlos, Zulia State]]
The state of Zulia is a compendium of diverse geographical areas. Plains, mountains, a large lake to which about 135 rivers flow that contribute water and sediment, an infinite number of lagoons, swamps and marshes that are in the lower parts. There are very arid zones with others of great humidity, very populated zones in small spaces and other extensive semi-populated areas. Very rich areas and others of great poverty.
 
The Lake [[Maracaibo Basin]] covers the large to the north and west, from the [[Guajira Peninsula]] to the [[Perijá Mountains]]. Venezuela's Andean states of [[Táchira]], [[Mérida (state)|Mérida]] and [[Trujillo (state)|Trujillo]] border Zulia State at the southern end of Lake [[Maracaibo Basin|Maracaibo]].

The name ''Venezuela'' comes from the lake. When Spanish [[conquistadors]] sailed into the area, they found the indigenous peoples living in communities of huts supported by stilts along the shores of the lake. They were reminded of [[Venice]] and named the place "Little Venice" or ''Venezuela''.<ref name=nameorig>{{cite book|title=One Thousand Languages: Living, Endangered, and Lost|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520255609|editor-first=Peter K.|editor-last=Austin|page=213}}</ref> The lake has a number of islands, some of which are populated.

Near the mouth of the [[Catatumbo River]], where it empties into Lake Maracaibo, is the famous [[Catatumbo lightning]] (''Relámpago del Catatumbo'')<ref name=slate_catatumbo>{{cite news|last=Foer|first=Joshua|title=An Everlasting Lightning Storm|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/world_of_wonders/2011/02/an_everlasting_lightning_storm.html|access-date=3 January 2013|newspaper=Slate|date=February 8, 2011}}</ref> which is represented on the state's flag and coat of arms by lightning bolts.

Due to its geographical location, Zulia has geostrategic and geopolitical advantages combined in the diversity of resources given by the nature of its geography, geology and hydrography, drawing in its territory a heterogeneous mosaic of potentialities for the economic, social and cultural development, manifested in the practice of agriculture, livestock, forestry, mining, fishing and tourism, with areas under special administration. These elements make Zulia a federal entity capable of contributing within the economic activities, a complex industrial marked by its uniqueness, reinforced by the routes and means of lake-marine communications that facilitate the entry and exit of products and goods to the [[international market]]. Consequently, it is a nodal center of development in the western geography of Venezuela that manages and concentrates its internal flows and placed at any point of the planet by its expeditious air, land, sea and lake routes.

The state of Zulia, from the [[geomorphological]] point of view, can be defined as a depression that presents in its center a great mass of water constituted by the Maracaibo lake system, combining the heights that surround it and the flat lands that serve as coastal support. The geomorphological evolution of the state of Zulia is related to the processes generated by the collision between the South American and Pacific tectonic plates, in their interaction with the Caribbean plate. Throughout its geological history, the Andes and Perijá became positive zones; however, an orogenic pulsation in the Upper Eocene and another one during the Miocene-Pliocene defined the current form of these mountainous systems, conditioning the depression of the Maracaibo and its surrounding plains.

These orogenic processes made the Perijá mountain range suffer a less intense uplift than the Andes and, therefore, its structural pattern and relief are more moderate. Likewise, the Ziruma mountain range develops towards the southeast, considered as a pre-mountain range system of relatively lower altitudes, where only [[tertiary]] rocks emerge.
.
According to the most recent classification, the state of Zulia presents three basic physical-natural units: the natural region of the Perijá mountain range; the natural region of the Corian sierras and the natural region formed by the depression of the [[Maracaibo lake]] and the coastal plains of the gulf of Venezuela.

=== The Perijá mountain range ===
[[File:Serrania del Perija - Cerro Pintao.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Sierra de Perijá National Park]].]]
The natural region Cordillera de Perijá or western Andean mountain range is located in the west of Zulia state. This unit occupies an area of 4,170.55&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, which represents 12.92% of the state. Part of the most western sectors of the Machiques de Perijá, Rosario de Perijá, Jesús Enrique Lossada, Mara and Guajira municipalities are located in this [[natural region]].
The Perijá mountain range can be considered a horst tectonic that starts in the valley of the Intermedio river, lengthening and narrowing in a south–north direction ending in the Oca mountains, from which the lowlands of the Guajira isthmus follow.
The Perijá mountain range comprises five large landscape units:
Sierra de Motilones, Sierra de Perijá, Sierra de Valledupar, Montes de Oca and the foothills of mountains and valleys.

=== Valleys ===

Between the Perijá mountain range and the Maracaibo lake there is a wide plain, very flat, which due to its topographic differences, drainage, edaphic and vegetal formations can be differentiated in two areas: a northwest area of less flat topography, with presence of hills in some sectors, scarce hydrographic network, sandy soils and low in organic matter.

Between the southern area of the Palmar River and the northern area of the Catatumbo River, the lands are very flat and low, particularly those closest to Lake Maracaibo are flooded during rainy periods or when there is an overflow of rivers, giving rise to [[alluvial]] sandy-clay soils.

=== The Maracaibo Lake Depression ===
This natural region includes the 21 municipalities that make up the state of Zulia and occupies an area of 24,377.81&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, representing 75.51% of the state. In the center of the depression is the engraved tectonic pit occupied by the water masses of the Maracaibo Lake system, "where more than 10,000 m3 of sediments have been accumulated, whose ages are from the [[Cretaceous]] (Mesozoic) to the Recent (Cenozoic). 
These deposits of both marine and terrestrial origin contain an important accumulation of hydrocarbons that make it one of the richest oil basins in South America.
[[File:Sunset At Congo Mirador (135960421).jpeg|300px|thumb|Sunset At Congo Mirador, Maracaibo Lake]]
The tectonic fossa is a product of the orogenesis directly related to the uplifts of the Perijá and Andean mountain ranges that occurred during the Tertiary period (late Eocene and Oligo-Miocene), and the Falcón mountain ranges (Oligo-Miocene). This pit occupies about 12,870&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of surface.

=== Alluvial plains ===
This type of landscape is formed by the deposition of sediments from the rivers of the western and eastern margins of the state of Zulia, specifically in the lower courses of the rivers Limón, Guasare, Cachirí and Socuy (municipalities Mara and Jesús Enrique Lossada); the rivers Palmar, San Juan and Apón (municipalities Rosario de Perijá, Machiques de Perijá and La Cañada de Urdaneta); in the western alluvial plains, while in the eastern alluvial plains (municipalities of Miranda, Cabimas, Santa Rita and Lagunillas) they are the result of the deposition of sediments from the rivers Araure, Mene, Ulé, Tamare, Pueblo Viejo, Machango and Misoa.  This landscape corresponds to flat lands, of recent origin and scarce height, which varies between 50 and 100 meters above sea level.

=== Swamps of the south of the lake of Maracaibo ===
The swampy landscape of Zulia State corresponds to the southern lands of [[Lake Maracaibo]]. They occupy an area of 1,766.53&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, which represents 5% of the state. In this plain, the Santa Ana River system converges, formed on its left bank by the Lora and Aricuaisá Rivers, and by the Tucuco and Río Negro Rivers, in their lower course, forming highly floodable lands, generating river arms, lagoons, lakes, among which the protected area known as Ciénagas de Juan Manuel National Park stands out.

To the southeast of the Santa Ana, towards the southern area of the lake, the Catatumbo river system, to which the Socuavó, Tarra and Zulia rivers drain, also provides significant volumes of water and sediments to the marshes.
Towards the southeast of the lake, in the sector located between the Pocó and Escalante rivers, there is close contact with the northwestern Andean slope, and there is a reduced relief of excrement cones, terraces and torrential lava flows that sometimes manifest themselves in low, rounded hills.

[[File:Catatumbolightning.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Catatumbo lightning]].]]

===Climate===
In the northern sector a semi-arid climate prevails, with an irregular pluviometric regime. The annual medial precipitation registered in Maracaibo city is between {{convert|358|and|665.99|mm|in|abbr=on}}, with a median temperature of {{convert|28|°C|°F}}. The precipitation rates increase in the western and eastern regions of Lake Maracaibo, forming a wet tropical savanna climate, with annual average temperatures from 27&nbsp;°C to 28&nbsp;°C, and rainfall exceeding {{convert|1000|mm|in|abbr=on}} registered in Mene Grande. In the southern lake region, increased rainfall conforms to a tropical rain forest climate with an annual average precipitation of 2,556&nbsp;mm, and surpassing 3,500&nbsp;mm per year in the heights of [[Serrania de Perija]].<ref name=goblinzulia>[http://www.gobiernoenlinea.ve/venezuela/perfil_zulia.html Venezuela's Gobierno en Linea web page -Perfil Zulia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911200941/http://www.gobiernoenlinea.ve/venezuela/perfil_zulia.html |date=September 11, 2008 }}</ref>

The geographical location and the diversity of natural landscapes present in the state of Zulia, in addition to the presence of Lake Maracaibo, define the great variety of climates present in the state. According to Koeppen's classification, there are desert climates (Bwhi), semi-dry tropical climates (Bshi), [[tropical savannah]] and sub-humid trophy forests (Awi), tropical rainy trophy forests and savannah (Aw "i), tropical rainy monsoon (Ami), tropical rainy jungle (Afi), very humid tropical temperate (Cfi), tropical humid temperate (Cwi) and undefined mountain climates.

Lake Maracaibo and its basin are factors that complement each other to produce high rainfall. However, for the specific case of the northern part of the state, the wind added to the flat [[relief]] causes dry climates, with values that vary between 200&nbsp;mm and 600&nbsp;mm of average annual precipitation, and a higher average annual evaporation than the precipitation, such as that which occurs in Maracaibo for the period 1993-2003 of 2,339&nbsp;mm.

The distribution of precipitation in the state of Zulia is influenced by [[latitude]], which generates an increase from north to south in the average annual precipitation of the Maracaibo (488&nbsp;mm), Cabimas (528.9&nbsp;mm) and Santa Barbara (1,366.5&nbsp;mm) stations. This behavior is explained by the descending latitudinal order, at except for the El Tucuco station (2,032.9&nbsp;mm), whose behavior is due to the altitudinal factor (205 meters above sea level), where the [[orography]] favors high rainfall.

=== Hydrography ===
[[File:Vista hacia el puente sobre el lago de Maracaibo.jpg|300px|thumb|Maracaibo Lake]]
The [[geomorphological]] conformation of the state of Zulia is a semicircular depression. It defines a hydrographic pattern that can be catalogued by its shape as a radial drainage, that is, that the waters coming from the water dividers are directed towards a
common outlet, Lake Maracaibo, which defines this characteristic pattern.

The Zulia [[Hydrography|hydrographic]] network is made up of numerous river basins and sub-basins that cover the states of Zulia, Lara, Táchira, Mérida, Trujillo and part of the Republic of Colombia, the latter drained by the Catatumbo River and its tributaries. All of them flow into the area comprised by the lake itself, the Maracaibo Strait and the El Tablazo Bay. Some sources indicate that the Maracaibo system is made up of four distinct but closely related bodies of water:
the [[Gulf of Venezuela]], El Tablazo Bay, the Maracaibo Strait and Lake Maracaibo. Although the estuarine portion is mainly constituted by the strait and El Tablazo, it is not possible to understand the estuarine biota without taking into account the other adjacent water bodies.

The Gulf of Venezuela participates in the oceanic components, hence the importance of considering the depth, movement and chemical composition of its water body. Such physical-chemical characteristics determine the capacity to absorb and dilute the contaminating elements that may be present in this water body.
The Gulf of Venezuela, with a total surface of 17,840&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, without including the bay of El Tablazo, is located to the north of the outer portion of the marabinal depression. Its shape is approximately rectangular, with the major axis in the northeast–southwest direction.
The outer limit of the gulf with the waters of the Caribbean Sea, on the north side, is given by a line between Punta Espada and Punta Macolla. The distance between both points is 111.12&nbsp;km.

The gulf of Venezuela is a body of water that presents the following movements: of sea, of [[tides]], marine currents and investments of water mass, which provides a high capacity to oxygenate itself and to dilute the pollutants and sediments. Scarce fluvial currents flow into this gulf, due to the arid conditions that characterize the continental territory that borders it. The most important hydrological contributions are not located in the sector of the marabine coast, but come from the mountainous system of the state of Falcon.

In the Maracaibo Lake basin, 21 major sub-basins have been identified, some of which go beyond the political-territorial limits of the State of Zulia.  The most important basin is that of the [[Catatumbo River]], with a surface of 25,708.36&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and represents more than a quarter (32.60%) of the total area of Maracaibo Lake Basin.

=== Soils ===
The soils of Zulia State, framed within the depression of Lake Maracaibo, are the result of the interaction of factors such as relief, climate, material
origin, vegetation and soil formation processes.

The edaphic diversity of the state of Zulia corresponds to the physiographic and climatic characteristics of the entity, hence to differentiate the types of existing soils the sectorization of the state is used, even though spatially they do not always maintain continuity, but similarity in the existing types of soil.

=== Vegetation ===
[[File:Manglares de la Laguna de Sinamaica..jpg|300px|thumb|Mangroves in the [[Sinamaica|Sinamaica Lagoon]]]]
The state of Zulia, due to its great territorial extension and the great variability of type of [[landscapes]], climate and soil, allows the existence of a great diversity of landscapes plants which, according to Huber's classification, can be grouped into tree, shrub and herbaceous formations. Tree formations include coastal mangroves, dry to semi-deciduous lowland forests, lowland evergreen forests, and mountain forests.

It is estimated that the total area of mangroves in Zulia State occupies an area of 116.3&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (44.9&nbsp;mi<sup>2</sup>), located in the Cocinetas, Peonias, Sinamaica and Los Olivitos [[lagoons]], and the mouth of the Limon River. For the coastal wetlands in the entire system of Maracaibo is estimated an area of 5,683&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (2,194&nbsp;mi<sup>2</sup>), highlighting in the south of the lake the swamps of Juan Manuel de Aguas Claras and Aguas Negras
.
The mangrove vegetation is rather dense. It comprises a set of predominant species, among which are: red mangrove (''[[Rhizophora mangle]]''), black and pink mangrove (''[[Avicennia germinans]]''), [[white mangrove]] (''[[Laguncularia racemosa]]'') and the buttonwood mangrove (''[[Conocarpus erectus]]'').

The category of dry semi-deciduous lowland [[forest]] occupies the largest area in the state, 18,872.7&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (7,286.8&nbsp;mi<sup>2</sup>). These plant formations are located above the western coast, in the municipalities Paez, Mara, Maracaibo, Jesus Enrique Lossada, San Francisco, La Cañada de Urdaneta, Rosario de Perijá, Machiques de Perijá, part of Catatumbo and Jesus Maria Semprum.

On the eastern coast they are distributed in the municipalities of Miranda, Santa Rita, Cabimas, Simón Bolívar, Lagunillas and part of the municipality of Valmore Rodriguez. In the municipality of Paez, these plant formations develop in dry [[climates]] with an annual average temperature of 28&nbsp;°C (82.4&nbsp;°F), average annual rainfall of 125&nbsp;mm to 250&nbsp;mm (5 inches to 10 inches) and in Aridisols and Entisols soils. The vegetation varies in size, density and species from the coastal area to the foothills of the Oca mountains.

[[File:American Flamingo Flamenco Phoenicopterus Ruber (67375537).jpeg|300px|thumb|Flamingos in the Ciénaga de Los Olivitos, a Wildlife Refuge and Fishing Reserve in the Municipality of Miranda]]
The fauna is distributed according to the terrestrial or aquatic habitat of fresh and marine water, lentic and lotic waters, and also ecotone fauna.
The dry sub-region includes the municipalities of Paez, Mara, Maracaibo, Miranda, Jesus Enrique Lossada, [[Cabimas]], La Cañada de Urdaneta and Lagunillas. This sub-region is home to vulnerable animal communities, considered to be taxa that face a high risk of extinction in the medium term. Among the different species of mammals, the palm tree bear (''[[Myrmecophaga tridactyla]]''), which lives especially in the northeast of the Lake Maracaibo basin, is threatened by poaching and is often rolled up on the tracks.

The cunaguaro (''[[Leopardus pardalis]]''), often in thorny forests, thickets and even in mangrove forests, this species - a house today - is threatened by distraction hunting; it is also destroying its habitat even though it is a species under an indefinite ban. There are others mammals in this sub-region that are at lower risk than those mentioned above, such as the endemic subspecies brownish-grey matacan deer (''[[Mazama gouazoubira]]''), which is distributed in arid areas and is persecuted as a source of subsistence food for its meat, which is considered to be of high quality. 
The red deer (''[[Odocoileus virginianus|Odocoileus virginianus gymnotis]]''), subspecies that has contracted by almost 50% in the arid zones of Zulia and in the basin of the Maracaibo lake due to the indiscriminate hunting to which it has been object, given the inexistence of a specific law to protect it. The yellow bat of the deserts (''[[Rhogeessa minutilla]]'') is distributed in the arid and semi-arid zones of the northeast and northwest of the state of Zulia. The decrease in vegetation as a result of livestock activity has generated a destruction of their [[habitat]].

Among the bird species, the little cardinal (''[[Carduelis cucullata]]'') is considered the most threatened not only in Zulia, but in the whole country. The cause of this situation is related to its capture and trade: the beauty of its plumage has been used as an ornament for hats. In less risk (prone to the effects of the activities human) stand out: the [[flamingo]] (''[[Phoenicopterus ruber]])'', distributed in the swamp of
Los Olivitos, Miranda municipality, and in the Gran Eneal lagoon, Paez municipality. Although this species cannot be classified as particularly threatened, the loss of its habitats, feeding and nesting areas, together with the lack of adequate management of its shelters, has led to important studies and pro-conservation campaigns, in order to protect and ensure its integrity.
[[File:Iguana from Vereda del Lago.jpg|300px|thumb|Iguana on the Vereda del Lago]]
Among the reptiles, the following stand out: the coastal [[caiman]] (''[[Crocodylus acutus]]''), whose distribution is severely reduced at present, is located mainly in the Pueblo Viejo dam, municipality of Lagunillas. It is an endangered species, threatened mainly by the commercialization of its skin. In lesser risk is a species of turtle, ''Morroccoy sabanero'' (''[[Geochelone carbonaria]]''), which is distributed in dry forest areas, and is illegally extracted. Two species of indigenous reptiles are named after Zulia: a turtle (''[[Mesoclemmys zuliae]]'') and a lizard (''[[Maracaiba zuliae]]'').<ref>Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). ''The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. {{ISBN|978-1-4214-0135-5}}. ("Zulia", p. 294).</ref>

In the humid and sub-humid Zulian sub-region, which includes the municipalities located to the southeast, south and southwest of Lake Maracaibo, live communities of animals that are largely the same as those living in the dry region, especially the birds. At As for [[mammals]], there are new species, such as the spider monkey, also known as the marimonda (''[[Ateles belzebuth hybridus]]''), a species that lives in the humid forests of the Maracaibo Lake Basin (includes the forests of the Perijá mountain range).

In the Perijá sub-region (mountainous area), the [[ecosystem]] is made up of a great diversity of animal communities: mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish. Representatives of some species of mammals in this subregion are: the spectacled bear (''[[Tremarctos ornatus]]''), which is in a category of threat (critical danger) due to the pressure exerted by the hunt, which has caused the decrease of the populations of these animals, in spite of being distributed in areas protected by the Venezuelan laws.

==Government and politics==
{{See also|Cabinet of Venezuela#Federal Council of Government}}

=== State Constitution ===
Since the creation of the Sovereign State of Zulia on February 17, 1864, with the approval of the first State Constitution, it regulates the structure and function of the government of Zulia. Like all Venezuelan State Constitutions, it is subject to national judicial review. Any of the provisions of the Constitution may be annulled if they conflict with national law and the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The Constitution of the State of Zulia was promulgated on August 13, 2003, and partially amended in 2011, currently in force, thus repealing the Constitution of 1989, its partial amendment of 1993 and 2001.

The Executive Power is represented by the Governor of Zulia State. The Governor is elected by means of direct and secret universal suffrage of all Venezuelan citizens residing in the territory of Zulia State and registered in the Electoral Roll of the State's circumscription.

The Zulian Legislative Council is made up of 15 members called "Legislators". In the last election the State was formed by 11 electoral districts. The voters of each circumscription choose the number of legislators according to the number of population living in the Municipalities according to the official census of the INE. The mandate of the legislators is for four year renewable periods, being elected by the people in accordance with the Constitution of the State and the Republic.

== Economy ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2023}}
[[File:Atardecer - Lagunillas - Costa Oriental del Lago de Maracaibo.JPG|300px|thumb|[[Oil industry|Oil structures]] on the Costa Oriental del Lago Region]]
The region has great economic resources among which are the livestock, oil, mining, agricultural and cheese production. Its economy basically depends on oil and natural gas. Oil activity has been carried out intensively since 1912, both on the mainland and in Lake Maracaibo, generating an income that exceeds the regional domain, since it is the main support of the national economy. It covers a great part of the national production of oil and hydrocarbons. Additionally, the coal mines of El Guasare are the most important in the country.{{cn|date=October 2022}}

The high potential of the soils in the south of [[Lake Maracaibo]], allow a significant agricultural and livestock development. It is the first producer of various agricultural and livestock items: oil palm, grapes, milk, cheese, cattle, sheep and poultry; the second in eggs and the third in cambur, bananas and goats. Also cultivated: sugar cane, coconut, yucca, cotton, beans, melon and sorghum. Forest production is also significant.{{cn|date=October 2022}} 
[[File:Antigua sede de la Mene Grande Oil Company.jpg|300px|thumb|Former headquarters of the Mene Grande Oil Company]]
The maritime resources make it the second largest supplier of [[fish]] in the country. Lake Maracaibo is fished for: bass, horse mackerel, mackerel, blue crab, small mouth, morning and sea bass, and in the Gulf of Venezuela: dogfish, horse mackerel, grouper and snapper. The shrimp was abundant in times before the 70's, when the saturation of fishing boats began, leading to its decrease.{{cn|date=October 2022}}
