==Geography==
===Location===
Luziânia is located 68km south of [[Brasília]] and is part of the area, called [[Entorno do Distrito Federal Microregion|Entorno do Distrito Federal]].

Although the city has existed as a settlement since colonial days, its rapid growth occurred in the eighties and nineties with the population explosion of the federal capital and the need for less expensive living areas outside the planned city.

The municipality is limited in the north by [[Valparaíso de Goiás]] and [[Novo Gama]]; in the south by [[Orizona]] and [[Ipameri]]; in the west by [[Santo Antônio do Descoberto]], [[Alexânia]], and [[Silvânia]]; and in the east by [[Cristalina]].

==Demographics==
In 2007 population density was 49.49 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>.  The population has almost doubled since 1980, when it was 92,817.  Today it is over 190,000 with fewer than 20,000 living in the rural area. (IBGE/Sepin)

In 1996 the population had grown to 246,000, but then the city lost much of its territory and population due to the formation of new municipalities like [[Valparaíso de Goiás]] and [[Cidade Ocidental]].
Since 1996 the population has continued to grow, showing an increase of 4.81% from 2000 to 2007.  (IBGE/Sepin)

==Economy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
Until the 1980s, Luziânia was a sleepy little agricultural town a half hour's drive away from [[Brasília]]. Then [[agribusiness]] discovered the relatively flat lands that could produce high yields of soybeans with central pivot irrigation. Today, the city is one of the most prosperous in the state, the second largest producer of beans and potatoes in the state, and the third largest producer of cotton and corn. In fruit cultivation, it is the first producer in the state of guava and the fourth of tomatoes and passion fruit (maracujá). The planted area of the main crops in 2006 was: cotton, 1,334 hectares; rice, 1,000 hectares; beans, 24,000 hectares; corn, 15,000 hectares; and soybeans, 40,000 hectares.

The economy is also strong in cattle raising (187,000 head in 2006), both for meat and dairy, as well as semi-precious stones, gravel, bricks, and a well-known sweet made from quince.  Due to the proximity to [[Brasília]] there is extensive production of fruits and garden vegetables.  The poultry industry is highly developed with 1,227,000 birds in 2006.

In a study made by the Secretaria do Planejamento e Desenvolvimento (Seplan) Luziânia was ranked in seventh place in the state in competitiveness.<ref>[http://www.seplan.go.gov.br/sepin/ Ranking dos Municipios] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070115162332/http://www.seplan.go.gov.br/sepin/ |date=2007-01-15 }}</ref>

The municipality is rich in gold, rock crystals and hardwoods like jatobá, aroeira, peroba, and angico are still found in the fast disappearing forests, now existing mainly on the river banks.

The [[Corumbá River]] passes west of the city and receives its untreated sewage, seriously polluting the river waters.

==Health and education==
In 2006 the city had two hospitals with 106 beds and 35 walk-in clinics.  The infant mortality rate was 21.11 in 2000, well below the state and national average.

The school system had 108 schools in 2007, with 51,799 students and 1,603 teachers. In July 2007 there were two institutions of higher learning:  a private school—Faculdades Integradas do Planalto Central-FIPLAC; and a campus of the state university—Unidade Universitária da UEG.  The literacy rate was 89.2% in 2000.
