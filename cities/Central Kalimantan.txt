'''Central Kalimantan''' ({{langx|id|Kalimantan Tengah}}) is a [[provinces of Indonesia|province of Indonesia]]. It is one of five provinces in [[Kalimantan]], the Indonesian part of [[Borneo]]. It is bordered by [[West Kalimantan]] to the west, [[South Kalimantan]] and [[East Kalimantan]] to the east, [[Java Sea]] to the south and is separated narrowly from [[North Kalimantan]] and [[Malaysia]] by East Kalimantan's [[Mahakam Ulu Regency]]. Its provincial capital is [[Palangka Raya]] and in 2010 its population was over 2.2 million,<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> while the 2020 Census showed a total of almost 2.67 million;<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 2,774,747 (comprising 1,434,119 males and 1,339,628 females), and was projected to rise to 2,809,700 at mid 2024.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Provinsi Kalimantan Tengah Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.62)</ref>

The population growth rate was almost 3.0% per annum between 1990 and 2000, one of the highest provincial growth rates in Indonesia during that time; in the subsequent decade to 2010 the average annual growth rate slowed markedly to around 1.8%, but it rose again in the decade beginning 2010. More than is the case in other province in the region, Central Kalimantan is populated by the [[Dayak people|Dayaks]], the indigenous inhabitants of Borneo.

== History ==
Since the eighteenth century the central region of Kalimantan and its Dayak inhabitants were ruled by the Muslim [[Sultanate of Banjar]]. Following Indonesian independence after [[World War II]], Dayak tribes demanded a province separate from South Kalimantan province.<ref>{{cite book
|title= Profile Central Kalimantan Province
|publisher= Central Kalimantan Province Tourism and Culture Board
|date=September 2001 }}</ref>

In 1957 [[South Kalimantan]] was divided to provide the Dayak population with greater autonomy from the [[Muslim]] population in the province. The change was approved by the Indonesian Government on 23 May 1957 under Presidential Law No. 10 Year 1957, which declared Central Kalimantan the seventeenth province of Indonesia. President Sukarno appointed the Dayak-born national hero [[Tjilik Riwut]] as the first Governor and [[Palangkaraya]] the provincial capital.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Riwut |first=Nila |title=Maneser Panatau Tatu Huang |date=2003 |publisher=Pusaka Lima |isbn=979-97999-1-0 |location=Palangkaraya |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

== Geography ==
Central Kalimantan is the largest Indonesian province by area ([[Papua (province)|Papua]] held this position until the 2022 partition) with a size of {{cvt|153443.91|km2}}, about 1.5 times the size of the island of [[Java]] and it is slightly larger than [[Bangladesh]] or the U.S. state of [[Illinois]]. It is bordered by [[West Kalimantan]] and [[East Kalimantan]] provinces to the north, by the [[Java Sea]] to the south, by [[South Kalimantan]] and East Kalimantan provinces to the east, and by West Kalimantan province to west.

The [[Schwaner Mountain]]s stretch from the north-east of the province to the south-west, 80% of which is covered in dense forest, [[Borneo peat swamp forests|peatland swamps]], [[mangrove]]s, rivers and traditional agriculture land. Highland areas in the north-east are remote and not easily accessible. Non-volcanic mounts are scattered in this area including [[Kengkabang]], [[Samiajang]], [[Liang Pahang]] and [[Ulu Gedang]].

The centre of the province is covered with tropical forest, which produces [[rattan]], [[resin]] and valuable timber such as [[Ulin]] and [[Shorea|Meranti]]. The southern lowlands are dominated by peatland swamps that intersect with many rivers. [[Sabangau National Park]] is a protected peatland area internationally acknowledged as sanctuary for the endangered [[Orangutan]]. Recently the peat swamp forests have been damaged by the [[Mega Rice Project (Kalimantan)|Mega Rice Project]], which unsuccessfully sought to turn large areas into [[rice paddies]].

The province's climate is [[tropical rainforest climate|wet weather]] equatorial zone with an eight-month rainy season, and 4 months of dry season. Rainfall or precipitation is 2,776â€”3,393&nbsp;mm per year with an average of 145 rainy days annually.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

=== Rivers ===
Central Kalimantan has numerous rivers from the catchment areas to the north in the [[Schwaner Mountains]], flowing to the [[Java Sea]]. The major rivers include:
* [[Barito River]] (900&nbsp;km)
* [[Kapuas River (Barito River)|Kapuas River]] (600&nbsp;km)
* [[Kahayan River]] (600&nbsp;km)
* [[Mendawai River|Katingan River]] (600&nbsp;km)
* [[Sampit River (Indonesia)|Mentaya (Sampit) River]] (400&nbsp;km)
* [[Pembuang River|Seruyan River]] (350&nbsp;km)
* [[Lamandau River]] (300&nbsp;km)
* [[Arut River]] (250&nbsp;km)
* [[Sabangau River]] (200&nbsp;km)
* [[Kumai River]] (179&nbsp;km)
* [[Jelai-Bila River|Jelai River]] (100&nbsp;km)

Rivers are an important mode of [[river transport|transportation]] and a primary location for settlement. With relatively undeveloped infrastructure, the province's economy relies heavily on the rivers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

== Ecology ==
Based upon the research of the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Central Kalimantan has approximately 10 different ecological regions and is dominated by two main ecological regions. Those two are peat ecological region which covered 26% of the total area of Central Kalimantan and the fluvial plain ecoregion which covered 21% of the whole area of Central Kalimantan.<ref name="ecoregion">{{cite web | url = http://182.253.224.163/assets/lampiran/DIKPLHD%20Kalteng.pdf | title = Informasi Kinerja Lingkungan Hidup Tahun 2019 | lang = id | date = 2020 | accessdate = 17 May 2023 | publisher = Environmental Services of Central Kalimantan}}</ref> Due to its high concentration of peat ecological region, Central Kalimantan is prone to drought and peat fires during the dry season and inundation during the rainy season within each episodes of the [[El NiÃ±oâ€“Southern Oscillation|ENSO]] and the [[Indian Ocean Dipole|IOD]]. These situations worsen because of massive deforestation in the region and climate change.

Central Kalimantan is also home for many endemic floras and faunas like [[orangutan]]s, [[proboscis monkey]]s, [[hornbill]] birds, [[rattan]], [[Eusideroxylon|Bornean iron wood]], etc. This province currently has three national parks i.e. [[Sabangau National Park]], [[Tanjung Puting National Park]], and [[Bukit Baka Bukit Raya National Park]] which are home to the endemic floras and faunas of Kalimantan.<ref name="ecoregion"/>

== Government and administrative divisions ==
Central Kalimantan Province, when separated from South Kalimantan in 1958, comprised three [[Regencies of Indonesia|regencies]] (''kabupaten'') - '''Barito''', '''Kapuas''' and '''Kotawaringin'''. However on 26 June 1959 two of these were split - Barito Regency was divided into a '''South Barito''' Regency and a '''North Barito''' Regency, while Kotawaringin Regency was divided into a '''West Kotawaringin''' Regency and an '''East Kotawaringin''' Regency. On 14 June 1965 the provincial capital of '''[[Palangka Raya]]''' was split off from Kapuas Regency to form an independent city (''kotamadya''). 

On 10 April 2002 an additional eight regencies were created by splitting existing regencies - '''Sukamara''' and '''Lamandau''' from parts of West Kotawaringin Regency, '''Seruyan''' and '''Katingan''' from parts of East Kotawaringin Regency, '''Pulang Pisau''' and '''Gunung Mas''' from parts of Kapuas Regency, '''East Barito''' from part of South Barito Regency, and '''Murung Raya''' from part of North Barito Regency. Thus the province now is administratively divided into thirteen regencies (each headed by a regent) and the single city. These are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 2020<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> Censuses, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Provinsi Kalimantan Tengah Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.62)</ref>

In addition to the civil service, Central Kalimantan also recognises a traditional governing system led by traditional leaders known as ''Damang''. The province is divided into 67 traditional law areas known as ''Kedamangan'', headed by ''Damang''. The system is intended to culturally recognise and preserve the customs and heritage of the Dayak tribes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://peraturan.bpk.go.id/Home/Details/89276/perda-prov-kalimantan-tengah-no-16-tahun-2008|title= PERDA Prov.

The province now forms one of Indonesia's 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the [[Indonesian Parliament|People's Representative Council]]. The '''Central Kalimantan Electoral District''' consists of all of the 13 regencies in the province, together with the city of Palangkaraya, and elects 6 members to the People's Representative Council.<ref>Law No. 7/2017 (''UU No. 7 Tahun 2017'') as amended by Government Regulation in Lieu of Law No. 1/2022 and Regulation of General Elections Commission No. 6/2023.</ref>

Central Kalimantan is well-known for its unique traditional carving. The three most famous carving from this province are the three dimensional wood carving sculpture of Sapundu and the traditional weapons i.e. Mandau and Talawang.

Sapundu sculpture is a three dimensional wood carving in the form of humanoid statue. This sculpture is commonly adorned with decorative motifs or even colors. Sapundu sculpture is mainly made of Bornean iron wood and usually presents during Tiwah procession. In ancient times, Sapundu sculpture symbolized the social status of its owner and was believed to possess magical powers.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://warisanbudaya.kemdikbud.go.id/?newdetail&detailTetap=258 | title = Warisan Budaya Tak Benda Patung Sapundu | publisher = Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology (Indonesia) | accessdate = 17 May 2023 | lang = id | date = January 2015}}</ref>

The ''[[Mandau]]'' and ''Talawang'' are the main traditional weapon of Dayak people in Central Kalimantan. The ''Mandau'' is a type of sword with a single edge blade i.e. one side is convex and the other side is concave. The ''Mandau'' consists of three different parts, which are (i) the ''Bilah'' or the blade that made of ''Mantikei'' iron plate with a sharp edge and is 70 cm long, (ii) the ''Pulang Gagang'' or the hilt that is usually made of wood, deer's horns, or even human bones, and (iii) the ''Sarung'' or the sheath which covers the blade and is typically made of wood and usually covered with bracelet-shaped bone on the upper part and wrapped by rattan rope.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://warisanbudaya.kemdikbud.go.id/?newdetail&detailCatat=932 | title = Warisan Budaya Tak Benda Mandau | publisher = Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology (Indonesia) | accessdate = 17 May 2023 | lang = id | date = January 2010}}</ref>

The ''Talawang'' is a shield that mainly made of Bornean iron wood that is carved with certain motifs and adorned with some bright colors. In ancient times, this weapon was used as a protection against wild animals and enemy's arrows and sword slashes.
