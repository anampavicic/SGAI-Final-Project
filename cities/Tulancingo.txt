'''Tulancingo''' (officially '''Tulancingo de Bravo'''; [[Otomi language|Otomi]]: '''Ngu̱hmu''') is the second-largest city in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[States of Mexico|state]] of [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]]. It is located in the southeastern part of the state and also forms one of the 84 [[municipalities of Hidalgo]], as well as the [[Archdiocese of Tulancingo]]. Located 93&nbsp;km from Mexico City, this area is the most important wool textile producer in the country and was home to [[El Santo]], Mexico's most famous [[lucha libre]] wrestler, and to [[Gabriel Vargas (cartoonist)]], author of the popular cartoon [[La Familia Burrón]]. It is also home to the [[Huapalcalco]] archeological site, which was the forerunner to the [[Teotihuacan]] civilization. The name derives from the [[Nahuatl]] words “tule” and “tzintle” which mean “in or behind the reeds.” This is confirmed by its [[Aztec]] [[glyph]].<ref name="encmuc">{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/hidalgo/municipios/13077a.htm |title=Estado de Hidalgo Tulancingo de Bravo |year=2005 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=State of Hidalgo Tulancingo de Bravo |access-date=July 26, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617104725/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/hidalgo/municipios/13077a.htm |archive-date=June 17, 2011 }}</ref>

==History==
The area is home to some of the oldest settlements in Latin America in Huapalcalco and El Pedregal. These first settlements have been attributed to the [[Olmecs]], Xicalancas and other tribes. A city was founded in 645 BCE by the [[Toltecs]] with the name Tolancingo as part of the empire centered in [[Tula, Hidalgo|Tula]]. During this period, the city was home to school and temples. A calendar stone was sculpted here and a temple called Mitlancalco was built to receive the bodies of priests and princes. After 1116 CE, the [[Toltec Empire]] declined and the city was abandoned.<ref name="encmuc"/>

According to the Tribute Codex (Códice de los Tributos), the Tulancingo area was a commercial center for the [[Otomi people|Otomi]]-Tepehua and [[Totonaca]] people since about 1000 CE bringing traders from lands now in the states of Hidalgo, Puebla and Veracruz. Traditional trading still exists in the form of the Thursday “[[tianguis]]” or market.<ref name="tianguis">{{cite web |url=  http://www.tulancingo.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=95%3Atianguis-tradicional&catid=10%3Aarticuloturismo&Itemid=57|title= Tianguis Tradicional |date=September 9, 2009 |publisher=Government of Tulancingo |location=Tulancingo |language=es |trans-title=Traditional Outdoor Market |access-date=July 26, 2010 }}</ref>

The [[Chichimeca]]s came to rule here under [[Xolotl (Chichimec ruler)|Xolotl]] starting around 1120. The city was refounded by these people and the remaining Toltecs.  The population increased with the arrival of the [[Tlaxcaltecas]]. In 1324, a king named [[Quinantzin]], reorganized the area politically, making Tulancingo the head of a province. Tulancingo marched against [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]], but was defeated. In the early 15th century, this same Texcoco, under [[Huitzilihuit]], conquered Tulancingo, putting it within the [[Aztec Empire]]. In 1431, the Tulancingo area was again reorganized politically under [[Itzcoatl]] and [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]].<ref name="encmuc"/>

During the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish Conquest]], Prince Ixtlilxochitl gathered an army here to join [[Hernán Cortés]] to conquer [[Tenochtitlan]]. Officially, the area came under Spanish rule in 1525, and evangelists arrived soon afterwards. The [[Franciscans]] arrived from Texcoco to build a hermitage in the Zapotlan neighborhood. This would eventually become the modern cathedral, consecrated to [[John the Baptist]].<ref name="encmuc"/> This was the beginning of the European city, which was initially constructed for the use of Europeans only; no indigenous were allowed to live there. Those indigenous who worked in city were obliged to live outside it on the outskirts at the base of the Cerro del Tezontle. Today this area is known as Colonia Francisco I. Madero and is part of the city proper.<ref name="nahuales">{{cite web |url=  http://www.tulancingo.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=374&Itemid=97|title= Los Nahuales de la colonia Francisco I. Madero |date=April 6, 2010 |publisher=Government of Tulancingo |location=Tulancingo |language=es |trans-title=The Nahuals of Colonia Francisco I. Madero |access-date=July 26, 2010 }}</ref>

The Valley of Tulancingo was partitioned between Francisco de Avila and Francisco de Terrazas. The fertile soil and warm climate attracted many Spanish settlers, especially older ones. In time, the area became known as the “Retiring place of Old [[Conquistador]]s.”<ref name="encmuc"/>

During the [[Mexican War of Independence]], the city was attacked several times by insurgents in 1812, 1814 and 1815. However, royalist forces were able to hold the city until [[Nicolás Bravo]] and [[Guadalupe Victoria]] took it in 1821, near the very end of the war. Bravo remained here for a time, founding a newspaper called El Mosquito de Tulancingo and constructing a gunpowder factory. This would lead to “de Bravo” being added as an appendage to the city's name in 1858. After [[Agustín de Iturbide]] was proclaimed emperor in 1822, he maintained a residence in Tulancingo, where he was supported by the populace. When Iturbide was dethroned, he withdrew from Mexico City to Tulancingo on his way to [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] and into exile.<ref name="encmuc"/>

Under the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|1824 Constitution]], Tulancingo was head of a district of the then enormous [[State of Mexico]], which today are the states of Mexico, Hidalgo, [[Morelos]] and [[Guerrero]]. The Tulancingo district included the areas around [[Apan]], [[Otumba de Gómez Farías|Otumba]], [[Pachuca]], and [[Zempoala, Hidalgo|Zempoala]].<ref name="encmuc"/>

Despite the ouster of Iturbide, Tulancingo favored a centralist form of government, rather than the state-based federalist one. It would provide refuge to centralists such as Nicolas Bravo during most of the 19th century. Bravo's forces were attacked here by federalist forces under [[Vicente Guerrero]] in 1828. Guerrero was victorious and Bravo fled into exile. In 1853, dictator [[Antonio López de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] imprisoned federalist [[Melchor Ocampo]] in the city. Because the city was loyal to the centralist cause, Ocampo was not placed in prison, but rather allowed to walk the streets where the citizens would supervise him. This continued until Santa Anna decided to send Ocampo out of the country.<ref name="encmuc"/>

During the [[Second French intervention in Mexico|French Intervention in Mexico]], the large State of Mexico was divided into three military districts for defensive purposes. The one in which Tulancingo belonged would eventually become the state of Hidalgo. President [[Benito Juárez]] could not hold Tulancingo and French troops entered in 1863. French emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] would use the same house in this city that Iturbide used before. This emperor divided the country into fifty departments, making Tulancingo the head of one of them.<ref name="encmuc"/>

In 1863, Tulancingo made the city the head of a [[Episcopal see|see]], under the archbishopric of Mexico City, despite desires to have the head of this see in [[Huejutla de Reyes|Huejutla]]. Its territory included parishes from [[Puebla]], Hidalgo and Mexico State.<ref name="cathenc">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15086a.htm |title=Tulancingo |encyclopedia=New Catholic Encyclopedia |access-date=July 26, 2010}}</ref> Soon after Juárez and the federalists ousted the Emperor Maximilian, the state of Hidalgo was created. Tulancingo was considered as a place to locate the new state's capital but Pachuca was chosen instead.<ref name="encmuc"/>

During the [[Mexican Revolution]], forces loyal to [[Francisco I. Madero]] under Gabriel Hernandez took Tulancingo in 1910. Madero himself visited in 1912. Forces loyal to [[Venustiano Carranza]] took the city in 1915, with Carranza visiting in 1916.<ref name="encmuc"/>

The municipal territory contains a number of small rivers and streams as well as mountainsides, making it susceptible to flooding. Two most recent major floods occurred in 1999 and 2007. Major flooding occurred in and around the city in 1999, with communities such as La Rosa, on the outskirts, the hardest hit, when rivers and streams overflowed. The flooding was caused by heavy and prolonged rainfall which affected several states in the region. Over 500 houses were abandoned in the city at the height of the disaster.<ref name="50familias">{{cite news |title= Evacuan a 50 familias en Hidalgo |author= Javier Peralta |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=October 1, 1999 |page=20 |language=es |trans-title=Evacuate 50 families in Hidalgo}}</ref> [[Hurricane Dean]] caused flooding damage again in 2007, when in less than 12 hours of rain, eighteen [[colonia (Mexico)|colonias]] were underwater with water pouring off mountainsides. Many houses were completely destroyed and a number flooded by sewerage. Those here were among the estimated 100,000 affected in Hidalgo state.<ref name="hurdean">{{cite news |title= Deja 'Dean' cicatriz |author= Verónica Jiménez |author2=Fernando Paniagua |author3=Ana Laura Vásquez |author4= Mayolo López |newspaper=Mural |location=Guadalajara, Mexico |date=August 24, 2007 |page=10 |language=es |trans-title=Dean leaves a scar}}</ref>

==The city==

The city is the second largest and second most important in the state. It lies at the foot of the Cerro del Tezontle mountain, which gives views of the city and much of the surrounding valley. At the top there is a restaurant, playground, sports facilities and more. Industrial development has made the city a gateway to the Sierra Poblana and the Mexico's northern Gulf coast. Despite the city's long history, almost no early colonial structures still survive.<ref name="generoso">{{cite news |title= Encuentros con Mexico / Un valle generoso (I) |author=Ricardo Diazmunoz |author2=Maryell Ortiz de Zarate |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=December 5, 2004 |page=10 |language=es |trans-title=Encounters with Mexico/A generous valley }}</ref>  It has its own Zona Metropolitana defined, containing 3 municipios, 204,708 people in the 2005 census up from 193,638 in 2000, covering some 674 square kilometers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.conapo.gob.mx/publicaciones/dzm2005/zm_2005.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-04-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313064956/http://www.conapo.gob.mx/publicaciones/dzm2005/zm_2005.pdf |archive-date=2012-03-13 }}</ref>

The city centers on its cathedral and the Jardin Floresta (Floresta Garden).  The cathedral's origins date back to 1528 when it was established as a Franciscan monastery, with a church dedicated to [[Francis of Assisi]].

One distinctive neighborhood whose origins can be traced back to the original founding of the Spanish city is Colonia Francisco I. Madero. Located at the base of the Cerro del Tezontle, it began as an indigenous settlement outside the city proper. As the city grew, it eventually was incorporated. The initial separation of the indigenous from the Europeans allows native culture to survive for a time after the Conquest. Old religious practices were maintained in secret and traditional herbal medicine continued to be practiced. Some residents claimed to be [[nahual]]s or Mesoamerican demons, making the Spanish of the city afraid to go into this area. Since then, people of this area have been called derisively “nahuals.” More recently, crosses have been placed in this area, especially in the intersection of 16 de Septiembre and Avenide del Trabajo to “scare” the nahuals that supposedly still live here.<ref name="nahuales"/>

This relatively flat surface is mostly of light volcanic rock cut with [[ravine]]s, small canyons, large hills and volcanoes. The larger canyons include Los Ermitaños, which forms a “Y” over one kilometer long. The highest point is the Cerro del Tezontle, named after the [[tezontle|volcanic rock]] it is principally made up of. Other elevations include Cerro Viejo, Napateco and Las Navajas. The main river is the Tulancingo River, which is part of the [[Metztitlán River]] system. There are four small lakes called Los Alamos, Otontepec, San Alejo and La Ciénega.<ref name="encmuc"/>

The climate is temperate to cold with an annual average temperature of 14C and average rainfall of between 500 and 550&nbsp;mm per year. Most rain falls from June to October.  Forested areas include trees such as pine, [[ocotea]], [[oyamel]], [[Cedar wood|cedar]] and walnut trees.

Most people of the city are familiar with the San Miguel Municipal Cemetery located on Miguel Hidalgo Street in the main city. However, the city and municipally have a number of notable cemeteries. Cemeteries here are a custom brought and imposed by the Spanish after the Conquest. Prior to this, the indigenous peoples buried their dead underneath their houses. The first cemetery in the city was located next to what is now the cathedral. Today, this cemetery no longer exists, as it has been abandoned and built over. Another notable cemetery in the area is the one at Santa Ana Hueytlalpan, where evidence of Otomi traditions can be seen such as the arrangement of Mexican marigolds and offerings of seasonal fruits, mole, sweets and alcohol. The Santa María Cemetery also has indigenous touches but this one has [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] influence.<ref name="tumbas"/>

The economy of the municipality divides into three sectors, agriculture, manufacturing, industry and mining and commerce. Agriculture employs 5.9% of the population, manufacturing, industry and mining employ 30.5% and commerce employs 63.6%.<ref name="encmuc"/>

The soil is semi arid and fertile. Just over sixty percent of the municipality's land is used for agriculture, pastures and for forest products. There is both seasonal and year-round irrigated agriculture practiced in the municipality. Major crops include corn, [[barley]], beans, wheat and animal feed. Most crops are produced seasonally with the total corn crop divided equally between seasonal and irrigated lands. Crops produced year round and usually irrigated include [[Opuntia|cactus fruit (tunas)]], [[alfalfa]] and hay. Livestock includes cattle, pigs, goats, sheep, horses and domestic fowl. Pine and some other trees are harvested for wood, but this is heavily regulated.<ref name="encmuc"/> The area is an important dairy product producer as well as a producer of cider, made from locally grown apples.<ref name="nafta">{{cite web |url= http://www.naftaconnect.com/tulancingo/main.html|title=Tulancingo |work=NAFTA Connect |access-date=July 26, 2010}}</ref>

These were part of the tribute items collected by the Aztecs. Textile production continued into the colonial period, especially to mining communities in the [[Real del Monte]] and Pachuca areas. Sometime during this period, the fabric produced switched to mostly wool. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the textile industry here and in the rest of Mexico was modernized and the first train station was opened to ship products. The Mexican Revolution disrupted train service and the textile industry here suffered but came back after the war was over led by the La Esperanza and Santiago Textil factories, and with about 21% of the wool fabric of the country produced here.
