==Etymology==
The city was founded in 1632 by the [[Cossacks]] and was originally called either the Lensky fortress or the Yakutsk fortress. The first version of the toponym came from the [[hydronym]] "Lena", the second, from "Yakutia", a synonym for [[Sakha Republic|Sakha]], eventually became the main one in use. In 1708 it received city status as Yakutsk.<ref>Поспелов Е. М. Географические названия мира. Топонимический словарь ISBN 5-17-001389-2</ref>

==History==
{{expand section|date=January 2023}}
[[File:Kate Marsden leaving Yakutsk.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kate Marsden]] leaving Yakutsk in 1891]]
The [[Yakuts]], also known as the Sakha people, migrated to the area during the 13th and 14th centuries from other parts of Siberia. When they arrived they mixed with other indigenous Siberians in the area.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Download Limit Exceeded |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/messages/downloadsexceeded.html |website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu}}</ref> The Russian settlement of Yakutsk was founded in 1632 as an ''[[ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]]'' (fortress) by [[Pyotr Beketov]].

With an intensely continental [[subarctic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfc'', closely bordering on ''Dfd'', [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]] ''Ecbd''), Yakutsk has the coldest winter temperatures for any city its size or larger on Earth. Average monthly temperatures in Yakutsk range from {{cvt|+19.9|C}} in July to {{cvt|-37.0|C}} in December. Yakutsk is the largest city built on continuous [[permafrost]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Вечная мерзлота и современный климат (geo.web.ru) |url=http://geo.web.ru/db/msg.html?mid=1159815&uri=index.htm |access-date=2018-12-09 |website=geo.web.ru |language=ru}}</ref> and many houses there are built on concrete [[Deep foundation#Pile foundation systems|piles]].

The lowest temperatures ever recorded on Earth outside [[Antarctica]] and [[Greenland]] have occurred in the basin of the [[Yana River]] to the northeast of Yakutsk. Although winters are extremely cold and long–Yakutsk has never recorded a temperature above freezing between 10 November and 14 March inclusive–summers are sunny, warm and occasionally hot (though short), with daily maximum temperatures exceeding {{cvt|+30|C}}, making the seasonal temperature differences for the region the greatest in the world at {{cvt|102|C-change}}.<ref name="Guinness">{{Cite web |title=Greatest temperature range on Earth |url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/greatest-temperature-range-on-earth |website=Guinness World Records}}</ref> The lowest temperature recorded in Yakutsk was {{cvt|-64.4|C}} on 5 February 1891 and the highest temperatures {{cvt|+38.4|C}} on 17 July 2011 and {{cvt|+38.3|C}} on 15 July 1942. The hottest month in records going back to 1834 has been July 1894, with a mean of {{cvt|+23.2|C}},<ref name="pogodaiklimat.ru" /> and the coldest, January 1900, which averaged {{cvt|&minus;51.4|C}}.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Погода в Якутске - климатический монитор за январь 2001 года |url=http://www.pogodaiklimat.ru/monitor.php?id=24959&month=1&year=2001 |website=www.pogodaiklimat.ru}}</ref> Yakutsk is the largest city in the world with an average winter temperature of below {{cvt|-30|C|F}}. {{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Yakutsk is an inland location, being almost {{cvt|1000|km|mi}} from the Pacific Ocean, which coupled with the high latitude means exposure to severe winters and also lack of temperature moderation. July temperatures soar to an above-normal average for this latitude, with the average being several degrees hotter than more southerly Far East cities such as [[Vladivostok]] or [[Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk]]. The July daytime temperatures are even hotter than some maritime subtropical areas. The warm summers ensure that Yakutsk, despite its freezing winters, is far south of the [[tree line]]. In winter, Yakutsk instead is between {{cvt|35|C-change}} and {{cvt|40|C-change}} colder than the mildest cities on similar latitudes in [[Scandinavia]].<!-- Tórshavn and Ålesund among others. -->

The climate is quite dry, with most of the annual precipitation occurring in the summer months, due to the intense [[Siberian High]] forming around the very cold continental air during the winter. However, summer precipitation is not heavy since the moist southeasterly winds from the Pacific Ocean lose their moisture over the coastal mountains well before reaching the Lena Valley.

==Transportation==
Yakutsk is a destination of the [[Lena Highway]]. The city's connection to that highway is only usable by ferry in the summer, or in the dead of winter, by driving directly over the frozen [[Lena River]], since Yakutsk lies entirely on its western bank, and there is no bridge anywhere in the Sakha Republic that crosses the Lena. In the dead of winter, the frozen Lena River makes for a passable highway for ice truckers using its channel to deliver provisions to far-flung outposts. The river is impassable for long periods of the year when it contains loose ice, when the ice cover is not thick enough to support traffic, or when the water level is too high and the river is turbulent with spring flooding. The highway ends on the eastern bank of Lena in [[Nizhny Bestyakh]] (Нижний Бестях), an [[urban-type settlement]] of some four thousand people. Nizhny Bestyakh is connected with [[Magadan]] by the [[Kolyma Highway]].

Construction of a [[highway]] bridge over the [[River Lena]] to Yakutsk was approved by president [[Vladimir Putin]] on 9 November 2019. Based upon a design submitted in [[2008]], it would be over {{cvt|3|km|sp=us}} long and constructed {{cvt|40|km|sp=us}} upriver at [[Tabaga, Yakutsk, Sakha Republic|Tabaga]], where the river narrows and does not create a wide flooded area in spring. The cost of the bridge and its {{cvt|10.9|km}} of approaches was estimated at 63.7 billion Rubles (83 billion rubles including VAT [НДС]), of which a grant of 54.2 billion Rubles was to be provided, with the remainder to be sourced from investors. The bridge was to be toll-free for cars, with a toll for trucks.<ref>{{Citation |title=По ленинским мостам - Инфраструктурный проект для Якутска одобрен президентом |date=18 Nov 2019 |url=https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/4162858 |work=Коммерсантъ |issue=211 |language=ru}}</ref> Work commenced in 2024, with an estimated cost of 130 billion Rubles and a proposed completion date of 2028.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Берега реки Лены свяжут за 130 миллиардов: в Якутии началось строительство Ленского моста » Новости на Vostok.Today – никакой пропаганды, только новости! |url=https://vostok.today/49259-berega-reki-leny-svjazhut-za-130-milliardov-v-jakutii-nachalos-stroitelstvo-lenskogo-mosta.html |access-date=2024-07-22 |website=Новости на Vostok.Today – никакой пропаганды, только новости! |language=ru}}</ref>

The bridge had originally been planned to be a dual-use [[railroad]] and highway bridge so the [[Amur Yakutsk Mainline]], the North–South railroad being extended from the south, could connect the city with the East–West [[Baikal Amur Mainline]]. The railroad reached the settlement of [[Nizhny Bestyakh]], on the opposite bank of the Lena from Yakutsk, in November 2011.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Russian Berkakit-Tommot-Nizhny Bestyakh line completed |url=http://www.railwayobserver.com/index.php/conventional-rail/asia/886-russian-berkakit-tommot-nizhny-bestyakh-line-completed}}</ref>

The 2019 completion of a new rail line to the eastern bank of the Lena permitted the start of passenger rail services between Yakutsk and the rest of Russia.

Yakutsk is also connected to other parts of Russia by [[Yakutsk Airport]].

==Education and research==
[[Yakutsk State University|M.K.Ammosov North-Eastern Federal University]] is situated in the city. There is also a branch of the [[Russian Academy of Science]]s, which contains, among other things, the ''Institute of Cosmophysical Research'', which runs the Yakutsk Extensive Air Shower installation (one of the largest [[cosmic rays|cosmic-ray detector]] arrays in the world), and the [[Melnikov Permafrost Institute]], founded in 1960 with the aim of solving the serious and costly problems associated with construction of buildings on frozen soil. In 2020, with [[global heating]] thawing the ground, the institute is measuring the rate at which the permafrost is thawing, which affects the city as well as the climate.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Will Vernon |date=18 September 2020 |title=Siberia's bizarre bumps (video) |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-54195656 |website=BBC News}}</ref>

At the primary and secondary levels, the city has a number of [[UNESCO ASPNet|UNESCO Associated Schools]], including the Sakha-Turkish College, Sakha-French School, [[Sakha-Korean School]], and [[Yakutsk School Number 16|School #16]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Nikolaev |first=Michael E. |date=January 7, 2007 |title=The Most Valuable Possession of a Society is Education |work=Yakutia Today |url=http://www.yakutiatoday.com/region/education_article_nikolaev.shtml |access-date=August 4, 2009}}</ref>
