'''Sabah''' ({{IPA|ms|ˈsabah}}) is a [[States and federal territories of Malaysia|state]] of [[Malaysia]] located in northern [[Borneo]], in the region of [[East Malaysia]]. Sabah has land borders with the Malaysian state of [[Sarawak]] to the southwest and [[Indonesia]]'s [[North Kalimantan]] province to the south. The [[Federal Territory (Malaysia)|Federal Territory]] of [[Labuan]] is an island just off Sabah's west coast. Sabah shares maritime borders with [[Vietnam]] to the west and the [[Philippines]] to the north and east. [[Kota Kinabalu]] is the state capital and the economic centre of the state, and the seat of the [[Government of Sabah|Sabah State government]]. Other major towns in Sabah include [[Sandakan]] and [[Tawau]]. The 2020 census recorded a population of 3,418,785 in the state.<ref name="Malaysia census 2020"/> It has an [[equatorial climate]] with tropical [[rainforest]]s, abundant with animal and plant species. The state has long [[mountain range]]s on the west side which forms part of the [[Crocker Range National Park]]. [[Kinabatangan River]], the second longest river in Malaysia runs through Sabah. The highest point of Sabah, [[Mount Kinabalu]] is also the highest point of Malaysia.

The earliest human settlement in Sabah can be traced back to 20,000–30,000 years ago along the [[Darvel Bay]] area at the Madai-Baturong caves. The state has had a trading relationship with China starting from the 14th century AD. Sabah came under the influence of the [[Bruneian Empire]] in the 14th and 15th centuries. The state was subsequently acquired by the British [[North Borneo Chartered Company]] in the 19th century. During [[World War II]], Sabah was [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo|occupied by the Japanese]] for three years. It became a [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|British Crown Colony]] in 1946. On 31 August 1963, Sabah was granted self-governance by the British. Following this, Sabah became one of the founding members of the Federation of Malaysia (established on 16 September 1963) alongside the [[Crown Colony of Sarawak]], the [[Colony of Singapore]] (expelled in 1965), and the [[Federation of Malaya]] ([[Peninsular Malaysia]] or West Malaysia). The federation was opposed by neighbouring Indonesia, which led to the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation]] over three years along with the threats of annexation by the Philippines along with the Sultanate of Sulu, threats which continue to the present day.<ref>{{*}} {{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2512&dat=19680924&id=iRNIAAAAIBAJ&pg=2922,2921522&hl=en |title=Filipino Students Protest in Manila Over Sabah Issue |newspaper=[[The Morning Journal]] |date=24 September 1968 |access-date=23 September 2016}}<br />{{*}} {{cite book |author= Hans H.

Sabah consists of five administrative divisions, which are in turn divided into 27 districts.

The administrative divisions were inherited from the provinces of the British administration.<ref>{{cite book|author=Great Britain.
