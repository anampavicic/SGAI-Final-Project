==Etymology==
Batangueños from the early years had their settlement in Bombon Lake and began dispersing to other places when the volcano erupted. While a group of people was moving to another settlement area, the image of St. Sebastian was stolen from them and later on was found on a tree called "lipa." People believed that the patron saint wished to name that place "Lipa". 

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
The primal composition in the southeastern region of Bombon Lake were elements of the dispersed colonial families founded by two datus, namely, Dumangsil and Balkasusa in [[Taal, Batangas]], between the 10th and 13th century. These pioneer settlers under the leadership of the fleeing Datu Puti, formerly purchased the lowlands from King Marikudo of Panay.

It is however subject to conjecture whether the pre-historic [[Negrito]]s 12,000 to 15,000 years age or the much later waves of Austronesian seafarers from 5,000 to 300 B.C. were able to settle along the coasts of Batangas into the inner lake region of [[Taal, Batangas|Taal]] which was accessible to navigation through the Pansipit River, thus, the possibility of miscegenetic marriages and cross culture among the [[Indigenous peoples of the Philippines|aboriginal]] inhabitants, the old settlers and the later Dumangsil and Balkasusa clans, or whether violent wars have been waged between the old inhabitants and new colonizers is uncertain as well.

Out of this Bornean tribe of the Dumangsil and Balkasusa clans came the ancestry of Lipa and as later on, their descendants who spread out towards [[Laguna de Bay]] and [[Bicol Region|Bicol]] Peninsula. The remains excavated from their ancient settlements in Butong, [[Taal, Batangas|Taal]], [[Calatagan]] and [[Balayan]] attest to the fact of their presence in the said site at least in the latter part of the 13th century down to the coming of Goiti and [[Miguel López de Legazpi|Legaspi]] in Batangas in 1570. The flourishing trade relations between these early Batangueños with a number of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] merchants prior to the [[Spain|Spanish]] conquest explained the presence of hundreds of [[China|Chinese]] wares from potteries to stonewares and vases of [[Song dynasty]] period to the latter part of the 16th century, in the burial grounds at [[Calatagan]] sites of Pulung Bakaw, Kay Tomas, Pinagpatayan I and II at Butong, all in Taal, Batangas.

By origin the early Lipeños were [[Buddhist]] in religion and [[Indianisation|Indian]] in civilization. With its not infrequent contact with the Chinese traders, the Batangueños have absorbed and been influenced too by China.  With the [[History of the Philippines (1565–1898)|Spanish colonization of the Philippines]] and the Salcedo conquest of [[Batangas]] in 1572, the Lipeños were forced to embrace [[Western culture|Western civilization]].

===Spanish rule===
At the coming of the [[Spaniards]] to [[Batangas]] in 1570, the [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]] settlements along the southern shores of [[Taal Lake]] at Tagbakin was inhabited by the warlike descendants of the two datus called the Tagalogs. In 1605, after Marshall Gabriel de Rivera received the encomienda of Bombon, the Augustinian Fathers made Tagbakin the first settlement of the Lipeños and a mission center with the name of San Sebastian, perhaps after the installed Patron Saint, which continued to the present.  The settlement was made a regular municipality in 1702 and a regular parish in 1716 with Fray Diego de Alday as the first curate.

With the eruption of [[Taal Volcano]] in 1724, the people moved to what is now "Lumang Lipa" and, again, in 1754, they moved to [[Balete, Batangas|Balete]] where they settled for two years until 1756 when they moved inland to the present site obviously for more security from volcanic eruptions. When Don Galo de los Reyes was the governadorcillo of Lipa, he introduced the cultivation of [[coffee]]. The seeds of the [[Coffea arabica|Arabica]] species were said to be of two chupas brought in from [[Mexico]] by an Augustinian missionary. The coffee industry so flourished and made Lipa the richest municipality in the country with an annual income of P4,000,000.00 that on October 21, 1887, the [[Queen regent]] [[Maria Christina of Austria|Maria Christina]], acting for the young [[King Alfonso XIII]], signed a decree elevating Lipa to a city known as "Villa de Lipa", and later authorized to use a [[coat of arms]] by the Royal [[Ministerio de Ultramar (Spain)|Overseas Minister]] Don [[Víctor Balaguer i Cirera|Víctor Balaguer]].<ref>For the text of the decree: Gaceta de Madrid. [http://boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE//1887/307/A00345-00345.pdf no. 307. pg. 345] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011005214/http://boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE//1887/307/A00345-00345.pdf |date=October 11, 2016 }}. November 3, 1887. BOE.es. Also published, along with the authorisation of a coat of arms, in the Gaceta de Manila: [http://digitallibrary.ust.edu.ph/cdm/ref/collection/gacetademan/id/9919 Año XXVII, tomo II, numero 174. pg. 805] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822173017/http://digitallibrary.ust.edu.ph/cdm/ref/collection/gacetademan/id/9919 |date=August 22, 2016 }}. December 21, 1887. digitallibrary.ust.edu.ph</ref>

At the celebration of the elevation of Lipa to a city in January 1888, [[José Rizal]] was invited by Dr. Jose Lozada, Catalino Dimayuga and the brothers Celestino and Simeon Luz but Rizal responded only with his Hymno Al Trabajo which he dedicated to the zeal and industry of the Lipeños.

The raising of [[Cocoa bean|cacao]] was introduced in Lipa by an Augustinian priest, Father Ignacio de Mercado, and that was the beginning of its [[Horticulture|cultivation]] throughout the Philippines.

The Lipeños also engaged themselves in livestock raising and varied home crafts for men, and small industries, like weaving, embroidery and sewing for women. After [[World War II]], citrus production prevailed until 1970 and, after its decline, about 1965, poultry and swine raising began to take roots and to thrive in no small degree until the present.

The first newspaper in Batangas, published in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], was the ''Lumubog-Lumutang'', printed in Lipa in 1889, and established by the well-known writers Cipriano Kalaw, Gregorio Katigbak, Benito Reyes, Hugo Latorre and Pedro Laygo. Other pioneer Spanish writers were Bernardo Solis, Catalino Dimayuga and Manuel Luz. 

During the revolution, Gregorio Aguilera Solis edited a newspaper ''Columnas Voluntas de la Federacion Malaya''.  This paper became the media for notable poems and literary works of Albino Dimayuga, Baldomero Roxas, Luis Lina Kison, Bernardo Solis, Benedicto Solis, Emiliano Manguiat and Petronio Katigbak. 

Roman Dimayuga wrote plays, while Pedro Laygo published articles on domestic and international politics and Tomas Umali on [[military]] affairs. Hispanistas during the [[United States|American]] regime included national figures like Teodoro Kalaw, Fidel Reyes, Arsenio Luz, Max B. Solis, Enrique Laygo and [[Claro M. Recto]]. Lipeños also served in the [[Revolutionary Republic]]. These were Gregorio Aguilera who was delegate to the [[Malolos Congress]]; Ceferino Pantoja, also a member of that congress; Jose Lozada, as envoy to [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Paris]], and Cipriano Kalaw, the first vice-president and Treasurer of the Central Committee of [[Hong Kong]].

[[File:Valerio Malabanan.jpg|thumb|left|Father Valerio Malabanan established a historical school that produced future leaders like Apolinario Mabini and Miguel Malvar]]

In the field of education, Father Valerio Malabanan<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thephilippinestoday.com/valerio-malabanan/ |title=Who is Valerio Malabanan? |date=July 8, 2020 |website=thephilippinestoday.com |publisher=The Philippines Today |access-date=March 29, 2021 |quote=Among his stellar pupils were General Miguel Malvar, one of the last Filipino leaders to surrender in the Philippine-American War; Melchor Virrey, a known educator in Manila; & Apolinario Mabini, 1st head of the Aguinaldo cabinet and Prime Minister of the 1st Philippine Republic. |archive-date=April 20, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210420072753/https://thephilippinestoday.com/valerio-malabanan/ |url-status=live }}</ref> was foremost among Lipeños who established schools. Others were Sebastian Virrey, Jacinto Silva, Candido Lantin and Gregorio Katigbak. In 1894, Brigido Morada established his own school at his house in Mataas na Lupa.  Under Father Valerio Malabanan were such well-known figures as [[Apolinario Mabini]], General [[Miguel Malvar]] and Sotero Laurel.

Sebastian Virrey countered with such former students as the brothers Alfonso and [[Claro M. Recto]]; Fidel and Carmelo Reyes; Teodoro and Maximo Kalaw; Pacifico, Jose and Enrique Laygo; and Manuel Luz Roxas, Jose D. Dimayuga, Bernabe Africa, Pablo Borbon, Potenciano Malvar, Leoncio Aranda and Bishop Alfredo Obviar. 

The later school, perhaps marked for permanence by the enthusiastic patronage of its high standard maintained through the years since its founding in 1922 until the present, is the Mabini Academy established by Dr. Jose Ma. Katigbak, Randall A. Rowley, Tarcila Malabanan-Katigbak and Emilia Malabanan. The fact that Lipeños, even up to the present, are very religious, may be attributed to the fact that Fr. Benito Baras, who was Parish Priest of Lipa for almost three decades (1865–1894), has considered Villa de Lipa as his very own and had shown great paternal love for the Lipeños that he constructed the Parish Church  (now Cathedral of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lipa|Archdiocese of Lipa]]) and a new and bigger cemetery with a chapel. 

A plaque of dedication to the opening and blessing of the new Campo Santo De Lipa (Cemetery of Lipa) can still be seen at the archway of the entrance,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/kasaysayannglipa/posts/pfbid02j9NAhHBz5c11no3EjYF1qDaqCCLDM2ZYCjHNqL9euY1Wfk6zRdV1LBWyKyscR2mkl |title=Kasaysayan Ng Lipa |author=Renz Katigbak |date=October 29, 2018 |website=herencialipena.com |publisher=Herencia Lipeña |access-date=April 16, 2023 |quote=For the Greater Honor and Glory of God.

Benito Baras' dedication to the people of Villa de Lipa. Moreover, without aid from the State, he constructed the bridge at Sabang and the road that served as a national highway to Manila and [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]]. 

The Parish of Lipa, established in 1716, became a diocesan center in 1910, included the provinces of Batangas, Laguna, Tayabas ([[Quezon]]), [[Marinduque]] and [[Mindoro]], with Msgr. Jose Petrelli as the first bishop. 

On August 15, 1972, the diocese was raised to an ecclesiastical province composed of Batangas province and the dioceses of [[Lucena, Philippines|Lucena]], [[Infanta]] and [[Calapan]], with Msgr [[Alejandro Olalia]] as the first Archbishop.

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
On August 31, 1947, Lipa was inaugurated as a chartered City created under Republic Act No. 162 approved on June 20, 1947.

==Geography==
[[File:Lipa City proper skyline Mataas na Lupa (Lipa, Batangas; 02-08-2024).jpg|thumb|View of Lipa from Barangay Mataas na Lupa]]
Lipa covers an area of {{convert|20940|ha|km2}} at an elevation of {{convert|1025|ft}} above sea level. Lipa's fishing area is located at barangay Halang, in the west of the city; it is actually a portion of Taal Lake, which is connected to other municipalities ([[Cuenca, Batangas|Cuenca]], [[Mataasnakahoy]] and [[Balete, Batangas|Balete]]).

Lipa is bounded by the city of [[Santo Tomas, Batangas|Santo Tomas]] in the northeast, the city of [[San Pablo, Laguna|San Pablo]] of [[Laguna province|Laguna]], and the municipalities of [[Tiaong]] and [[San Antonio, Quezon]] in the east, the municipalities of [[Padre Garcia, Batangas|Padre Garcia]] and [[Rosario, Batangas|Rosario]] in the southeast, the municipalities of [[Ibaan, Batangas|Ibaan]] and [[San Jose, Batangas|San Jose]] in the southwest, the municipalities of [[Cuenca, Batangas|Cuenca]] and Mataasnakahoy and [[Taal Lake]] in the west and the municipalities of [[Balete, Batangas|Balete]] and [[Malvar, Batangas|Malvar]] in the northwest.

The city's location, in a valley between the [[Malepunyo Mountain Range]] and [[Mount Macolod]], makes it a low-risk area for natural disasters. These two mountains serve as a windbreak during typhoons. Mount Macolod, in the west, also served as shield during eruptions of the [[Taal Volcano]].

===Barangays===
Lipa is politically subdivided into 72 [[barangay]]s. Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s and some have [[sitios]].

=== Religion ===

====Catholicism====
[[File:Lipa Cathedral 2024-03-27.jpg|thumb|[[Lipa Cathedral]], the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lipa]]]]
Majority of the city's population are [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Roman Catholic]]s, and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lipa]] today comprises the civil province of Batangas. Formed as the Diocese of Lipa on April 10, 1910, the archdiocese once covered other provinces such as Batangas, Laguna, Quezon, Marinduque and Mindoro, with Most Reverend Joseph Petrelli, D.D. as the first bishop. Currently, the archdiocese is divided into 6 [[vicariate]]s, each headed by a [[vicar forane]]. There are 49 parishes in all, served by 143 priests (122 of which are diocesan), 13 religious brothers, and 197 religious sisters. There are also 23 existing Catholic schools, two high school seminaries, three college seminaries, and two pastoral centers.

The Church and Monastery of Lipa is the location of a 1940s apparition of the Virgin Mary which was seen by sister Teresing Castillo and numerous accounts of rose petal showers from the 1940s to the 1960s. Some of the rose petals, which had the silhouette of the Virgin Mary when flashed with light, have been preserved by the Diocese of Lipa and various townfolks who have witnessed the petal showers. An investigation conducted by researchers of the University of the Philippines proved that the figures on the petals were natural and not stamped by man-made means. A few years after the apparition of the Virgin Mary, the Vatican released a document stating that the apparition in Lipa was false. Despite this, the rose petal showers continued until the last apparition of Mary appeared, saying three things, of which the most important was to 'pray for China', which at the time was among the poorest regions in the world. Due to the decline of the Vatican regarding the apparition, the Diocese of Lipa ordered the destruction of Mary's statue in the church which depicted the apparition. However, the founding nuns of the church hid it instead. Decades afterwards in the 21st century, before the death of a founding nun, she wished for the statue of the apparition to be viewed by the public once more. Thousands of devotees went back to the church and since then, the statue has been in public view. During a certain event, the priest ordered a mass outside the church to bless the municipality of Lipa, where the apparition statue was brought outside as well. During that time, sun beatings from heaven, which was viewed by thousands of people during a mass outside the church, occurred. Devotees flocked Lipa afterwards, where cures for blindness and terminal sickness were cured through the usage of prayers with the preserved petals from the petal showers of the 1940s to the 1960s. In 2014, it was later found out that most of the bishops who signed in favor of declaring the apparitions of the 1940s as a lie were forced to sign such documents. This sparked the current Lipa Church to gather as much evidence to back the existence and miracles of the apparitions.

====Protestants and other groups====
There are other Christian groups such as various Protestant denominations including [[Evangelical Christianity|Evangelicals]], [[Born again (Christianity)|Born Again]], [[Iglesia ni Cristo]], [[Members Church of God International|Members Church of God International (MCGI)]], Kingdom of Jesus Christ, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-Day Adventist]], and [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].

Other religions include [[Islam in the Philippines|Islam]] and [[Buddhism]].

Lipa's proximity to the country's capital, [[Manila]], having an approximate distance of 86 kilometers or an hour and half drive via the Southern Luzon Expressway enhances its strategic access to development trends. It is fast emerging as a key city in the [[province]], becoming a major institutional/administrative center, medical center, commercial center, financial center, agro-industrial center and residential center.

It is identified as an ideal hub and center of the [[Calabarzon]] Agro-Industrial Region in the Regional Physical Framework Plan of [[Region IV-A]]. In the recent past, Lipa is being transformed from an [[agricultural|agrarian]] to an urbanized area. A significant portion of the agricultural land area of the city has been converted to residential subdivisions, industrial area with the establishment of [[Lima Technology Center]] utilizing lands in the city and [[Malvar, Batangas|Malvar Municipality]]. Recently, the influx of [[business process outsourcing]] (BPO) firms such as call centers have contributed much to the growth of the local economy. BPO sites are scattered throughout the city. It ranked 6th out of 10 in the Top 10 next wave cities of 2010 by the Commission of Information and Communication Technology (ICCT).  Teletech Inc. pioneered the BPO company in Lipa City in 2006. Alorica followed after few years. The most recent BPO company is The Results.

Likewise, due to a very strategic location, the Lipa City Market is comparatively busy than other neighboring towns. Thus it boasts a large quantity of market business. As a result, it attracts more customers from neighboring towns like Padre Garcia, Rosario, Ibaan, San Juan, Malvar, Mataas na Kahoy, Balete, Cuenca, and Lemery and from the cities of Batangas, Santo Tomas and Tanauan. An S&R Membership Shopping outlet is located besides it.

It is also noticeable that Lipa City is being home to new settlers from different regions. Muslims from Mindanao for example have settled in Lipa City, primarily due to growing economy. There are also settlers from Mindoro, Bicol, Quezon and other places.  Likewise, there are many Koreans who established their business in Lipa. Furthermore, it is evident that Indian Nationals are also an everyday sight.

===Food===

Lipa is the home of ''[[lomi]]''. According to history, this is primarily due to the influence of early Chinese settlers.
Lomi is cooked using raw noodles, cassava mixed with water, beaten egg, salt and pepper, meat, liver and other ingredients that make it tasty. Eventually, there are countless of variations of Lomi these days. The lomi house is a very common place found in every barangay. However, there are a few recognized by the Lipenos, like Renfel, Kids Lomihouse, LBN, Beegees, Liam's to mention a few.

''Goto'' is also a popular recipe. It is usually composed of internal organs of cows. This is a bowl of hot soup with beef, tripe, entrails, and blood, added with fish sauce and ''calamansi'' juice with chili.

However, due to influx of culture from nearby provinces, Lipeños also enjoy new recipes like ''sisig'' of Pampanga, and ''Bicol Express'' of Bicol.
Due to Lipa's craze for food, several food courts have been established.

===Technology===
Lipa has few technologically advanced [[infrastructure]]. PKI is one of the advanced factories that pioneered the productions in Lipa City.

The ground floor serves as a function area and features works of several contemporary Lipeño visual artists.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

===Religious monuments===
In 1605, Don Diego de Salcedo discovered a community of farmers living in fairly good economic conditions at Lake Bombon, now Tagbakin, Lipa City. The Augustinians among them started a religious mission called “Convent of San Sebastian in Comintang”.

However, the residents noticed that the land area- residential and agricultural-was getting smaller due to the rising waters of Taal Lake, they transferred to Balete. But the site was submerged by the lake in 1754 after the eruption of Taal Volcano. To avoid a similar occurrence, the townsfolk decided to transfer the town to a place far from the lake and the volcano. Legend has it that they agreed to pray the rosary while walking and whenever they may be at the end of the 24th mystery, there the town would be relocated. And they walked upland, away from the lake and the volcano, and at the end of the 24th mystery, they reached what is now called Mataas na Lupa. The temporary poblacion and the church were thus resettled there.

The location benefited everybody since it was along the main road that led to the coastal towns, the ground was high enough and the east winds were hedged in by high mountains. But after some time, the settlers had to seek another location due to the problem of water supply. The “better site” is the present site of the cathedral. The Augustinians administered the parish until the end of the 19th century.

The first church building was made of light materials. The building of “serious architecture, proven solidity and great proportions” was begun in 1779 and finally completed in 1865, on the first year of Fr. Benito Varas who administered the town until 1894.

The church was made of hewn stone and tiled roof, in accordance with the usual pattern of churches. It was a rectangular structure with artistically painted wooden panelings in lieu of an arch to which were attached support and strong beams which crisscrossed the walls to protect the building from earthquakes, attractive and had plain and simple altar ornaments without the extravagant carvings that were characteristic of the past century.

During the 19th century, keen competition among Tanauan, Lipa, Batangas, Bauan and Taal for the choice of the seat of new diocese in the Southern Tagalog Region, with Batangas Province at the center, motivated the people to build extraordinary, big churches. On April 10, 1910, the historic creation of the new diocese took place and the first bishop, Joseph Petrelli, selected Lipa as the see because of its cool climate. In later years, there were moves to transfer the see to San Pablo City but Bishop [[Alfredo Versoza|Alfredo Verzosa]] turned it down due to poor religious environment of San Pablo during that time.

The church suffered heavily in 1944. Alejandro Olalia repaired the façade, the dome, the transept, the roof, the main altar, and the belfry. The interior painting was retouched. Two side aisles were added. The church was awarded the title Cathedral of the archdiocese incorporating Batangas Province during the administration of Cardinal [[Rufino Santos]].

Pedro G. Galende wrote that "the emphasis (of the edifice) is placed on the mass, which appeals much more to the senses due to its harmonic organization. The three buildings – church, convent and bell tower are so closely associated with each other that they well exemplify the typical mission complex."

At present, the 220-year old cathedral and convent is undergoing restoration and repairs.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Through the efforts of the parish priest, Alfredo A. Madlangbayan, and the San Sebastian Millenium Restoration Committee, the church façade and the belfry have been repainted, the pews are newly varnished, the ceiling and the roof of the dome have been repaired, the old and leaking roof of the church and convent are replaced with long span GI sheets, and there is a new altar at the vigil room.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} On account of the multitude of faithful gathering at the church during liturgical activities, especially for archdiocesan affairs, the sound system was also upgraded.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

===Festivals===
In the previous years, Lipa City had the Coffee Festival as its official city festival being coffee granary of the Philippines. The Coffee Festival was then celebrated from December 11 to 16.

Then Lipa also had the Walistik Festival celebrated on the second week of January where walis (broom) was used in costumes and props. Walis symbolizes unity and this was what the Lipeños had in mind every time they celebrate Walistik Festival.

Now, Lipa City is celebrating Lomi Festival. Lomi, being one of the most popular dishes in this side of the province, Lipa City has quite a number of lomi houses which never cease to entice people.

Traditionally, however, Lipa City is celebrating Lipa City Town Fiesta annually every January 20. This is a date to celebrate the feast of their patron saint, Saint Sebastian. During the celebration, the main road of CM Recto is flocked with market-stalls selling affordable items. Also peoples visit the Lipa City Cathedral to attend mass. Houses prepare and serve food to visitors.
