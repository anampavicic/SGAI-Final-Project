==History==
{{Main|History of Portland, Oregon}}

{{For timeline|Timeline of Portland, Oregon}}

===Pre-settlement history===
During the prehistoric period, the land that would become Portland [[Missoula floods|was flooded after the collapse of glacial dams]] from [[Lake Missoula]], in what would later become Montana. These massive floods occurred during the last ice age and filled the Willamette Valley with {{convert|300|to|400|ft|m}} of water.{{Sfn|Allen|Burns|Sargent|2009|pages=175–89}}

Before American settlers began arriving in the 1800s, the land was inhabited for many centuries by two bands of indigenous [[Chinook people]]{{snd}}the [[Multnomah people|Multnomah]] and the [[Clackamas people|Clackamas]].{{sfn|Marschner|2008|p=187}} The Chinook people occupying the land were first documented [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|in 1805]] by [[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark]].<ref name="anderson"/> Before its European settlement, the Portland Basin of the lower Columbia River and Willamette River valleys had been one of the most densely populated regions on the Pacific Coast.<ref name="anderson">{{cite web|url=https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bps/article/214638|work=City of Portland Bureau of Planning and Sustainability|author=Anderson, Susan|year=2009|title=East Portland Historical Overview & Historic Preservation Study|access-date=October 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101195109/http://www.portlandoregon.gov/bps/article/214638|archive-date=January 1, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Large numbers of pioneer settlers began arriving in the Willamette Valley in the 1840s via the [[Oregon Trail]] with many arriving in nearby [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=First Year in Oregon, 1840–1869: A Narrative History (U.S. National Park Service)|url=https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/first-year-in-oregon-1840-1869-a-narrative-history.htm|access-date=August 25, 2022|website=nps.gov}}</ref> A new settlement then emerged ten miles from the mouth of the Willamette River,{{sfn|Scott|1890|p=61}} roughly halfway between Oregon City and [[Hudson's Bay Company]]'s [[Fort Vancouver]]. This community was initially referred to as "Stumptown" and "The Clearing" because of the many trees cut down to allow for its growth.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Orloff|first=Chet|year=2004|title=Maintaining Eden: John Charles Olmsted and the Portland Park System|journal=Yearbook of the Association of Pacific Coast Geographers|volume=66|pages=114–19|doi=10.1353/pcg.2004.0006|s2cid=129896123|issn=0066-9628}}</ref> In 1843 [[William Overton (Portland founder)|William Overton]] saw potential in the new settlement but lacked the funds to file an official land claim. For 25 cents, Overton agreed to share half of the {{convert|640|acre|km2|adj=on}} site with [[Asa Lovejoy]] of [[Boston]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohs.org/education/oregonhistory/historical_records/dspDocument.cfm?doc_ID=000128AC-3AC7-1E8B-891B80B0527200A7|work=Oregon History Project|title=Overton Cabin|access-date=October 29, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015811/http://www.ohs.org/education/oregonhistory/historical_records/dspDocument.cfm?doc_ID=000128AC-3AC7-1E8B-891B80B0527200A7|archive-date=November 17, 2015}}</ref>

In 1844, Overton sold his remaining half of the claim to [[Francis W. Pettygrove]] of [[Portland, Maine]]. Both Pettygrove and Lovejoy wished to rename "The Clearing" after their respective hometowns (Lovejoy's being Boston, and Pettygrove's, Portland). This controversy was settled with a coin toss that Pettygrove won in a series of two out of three tosses, thereby providing Portland with its namesake.<ref name="naosum.org">{{cite web|title=Portland: The Town that was Almost Boston|publisher=National Association of Scientific Materials Managers|url=http://www.naosmm.org/confer/port-or/history.html|access-date=March 7, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727122038/http://www.naosmm.org/confer/port-or/history.html|archive-date=July 27, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The coin used for this decision, now known as the [[Portland Penny]], is on display in the headquarters of the [[Oregon Historical Society]].

Portland's access to the [[Pacific Ocean]] via the Willamette and Columbia rivers, as well as its easy access to the agricultural [[Tualatin Valley]] via the "[[Canyon Road|Great Plank Road]]" (the route of current-day [[U.S. Route 26 in Oregon|U.S. Route 26]]), provided the pioneer city with an advantage over other nearby ports, and it grew very quickly.<ref>"City keeps lively pulse". (Spencer Heinz, ''The Oregonian'', January 23, 2001)</ref> Portland remained the major port in the Pacific Northwest for much of the 19th century, until the 1890s, when Seattle's deepwater harbor was connected to the rest of the mainland by rail, affording an inland route without the treacherous navigation of the Columbia River. The city had its own Japantown,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/nikkeialbum/albums/44/slide/|title=Portland's Japantown}}</ref> for one, and the [[lumber industry]] also became a prominent economic presence, due to the area's large population of [[Douglas fir]], [[western hemlock]], [[Thuja plicata|red cedar]], and [[Acer macrophyllum|big leaf maple]] trees.<ref name="anderson"/>

===Topography===
Portland is {{convert|60|mi|km}} east of the Pacific Ocean at the northern end of [[Oregon]]'s most populated region, the Willamette Valley. Downtown Portland straddles the banks of the Willamette River, which flows north through the city center and separates the city's east and west neighborhoods. Less than {{convert|10|mi|km}} from downtown, the Willamette River flows into the Columbia River, the fourth-largest river in the United States, which divides Oregon from Washington state. Portland is approximately {{convert|100|mi|km}} upriver from the Pacific Ocean on the Columbia.

Though much of downtown Portland is relatively flat, the foothills of the [[Tualatin Mountains]], more commonly referred to locally as the "West Hills", pierce through the northwest and southwest reaches of the city. [[Council Crest Park]] at {{convert|1073|ft|m}} is often quoted as the highest point in Portland; however, the highest point in Portland is on a section of NW Skyline Blvd just north of [[Willamette Stone|Willamette Stone Heritage site]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hale|first=Jamie|date=April 28, 2016|title=Council Crest hike is well worth the extra effort|url=https://www.oregonlive.com/travel/2016/04/a_drive_is_nice_but_a_hike_up.html|access-date=August 15, 2020|work=The Oregonian}}</ref> The highest point east of the river is [[Mount Tabor, Portland, Oregon|Mt. Tabor]], an extinct volcanic cinder cone, which rises to {{convert|636|ft|m}}. Nearby [[Powell Butte]] and [[Rocky Butte]] rise to {{convert|614|ft|m}} and {{convert|612|ft|m}}, respectively.

Portland has a [[warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csb),'' falling just short of a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] (Köppen ''Csa)'' with cool and rainy winters, and warm and dry summers.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=138}} This climate is characterized by having overcast, wet, and changing weather conditions in fall, winter, and spring, as Portland lies in the direct path of the stormy westerly flow, and warm, dry summers when the [[North Pacific High]] reaches its northernmost point in mid-summer.<ref name="fao.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/ad652e/ad652e07.htm|title=Global Ecological Zoning for the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2000|year=2001|publisher=Forestry Department of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]|access-date=September 12, 2012}}</ref> Portland's [[Hardiness zone|USDA Plant Hardiness Zone]] is 8b, with parts of the Downtown area falling into zone 9a.<ref name="Portland OR Extremes" />

Winters are cool, cloudy, and rainy. The coldest month is December with an average daily high temperature of {{convert|46.9|°F|1|abbr=}}, although overnight lows usually remain above freezing by a few degrees. Evening temperatures fall to or below freezing 32 nights per year on average, but very rarely below {{convert|18|°F|0}}.

The warmest month is August, with an average high temperature of {{convert|82.3|°F|1|abbr=}}. Because of its inland location {{convert|62|mi|km}} from the coast, as well as the protective nature of the [[Oregon Coast Range]] to its west, Portland summers are less susceptible to the moderating influence of the nearby Pacific Ocean. Consequently, Portland occasionally experiences [[heat wave]]s, with temperatures rising above {{convert|90|°F|0}} for a few days. However, on average, temperatures reach or exceed {{convert|80|°F|0}} on only 61 days per year, of which 15 days will reach {{convert|90|°F|0}} and only 1.3 days will reach {{convert|100|°F|0}}.

Spring and fall can bring variable weather including high-pressure ridging that sends temperatures surging above {{convert|80|°F|0}} and cold fronts that plunge daytime temperatures into the 40s °F (4–9&nbsp;°C). However, lengthy stretches of overcast days beginning in mid-fall and continuing into mid-spring are most common.

===Cityscape===
{{See also|Architecture of Portland, Oregon|List of tallest buildings in Portland, Oregon|Downtown Portland}}

Portland's cityscape derives much of its character from the many bridges that span the Willamette River downtown, several of which are historic landmarks, and Portland has been nicknamed "Bridgetown" for many decades as a result.<ref name="bridgetown"/> Three of downtown's most heavily used bridges are more than 100 years old and are designated historic landmarks: [[Hawthorne Bridge]] (1910), [[Steel Bridge]] (1912), and [[Broadway Bridge (Portland, Oregon)|Broadway Bridge]] (1913). Portland's newest bridge in the downtown area, [[Tilikum Crossing]], opened in 2015 and is the first new bridge to span the Willamette in Portland since the 1973 opening of the double-decker [[Fremont Bridge (Portland)|Fremont Bridge]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Newcomb|first=Tim|date=August 20, 2015|title=You Can't Drive Across This Gorgeous Bridge|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/g2136/portland-tillikum-crossing-bridge-no-cars/|access-date=January 14, 2021|website=Popular Mechanics}}</ref>

Other bridges that span the Willamette River in the downtown area include the [[Burnside Bridge]], the [[Ross Island Bridge]] (both built 1926), and the double-decker [[Marquam Bridge]] (built 1966). Other bridges outside the downtown area include the [[Sellwood Bridge]] (built 2016) to the south; and the [[St. Johns Bridge]], a [[Gothic revival]] suspension bridge built in 1931, to the north. The [[Glenn L. Jackson Memorial Bridge]] and the [[Interstate Bridge]] provide access from Portland across the Columbia River into Washington state.

[[File:Portland.png|thumb|The five previous addressing sectors of Portland, prior to the addition of South Portland]]

The Willamette River, which flows north through downtown, serves as the natural boundary between East and West Portland. The denser and earlier-developed west side extends into the lap of the [[Tualatin Mountains|West Hills]], while the flatter east side extends for roughly 180 blocks until it meets the suburb of [[Gresham, Oregon|Gresham]]. In 1891 the cities of Portland, [[Albina, Oregon|Albina]], and [[East Portland, Oregon|East Portland]] were consolidated, creating inconsistent patterns of street names and addresses. It was not unusual for a street name to be duplicated in disparate areas. The "Great Renumbering" on September 2, 1931, standardized street naming patterns and divided Portland into five "general districts." It also changed house numbers from 20 per block to 100 per block and adopted a single street name on a grid. For example, the 200 block north of Burnside is either NW Davis Street or NE Davis Street throughout the entire city.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ordinance 61325: Street re-numbering report.

The Willamette River divides the city into east and west while [[Burnside Street]], which traverses the entire city lengthwise, divides the north and south.

Portland is one of only four cities in the U.S. with extinct volcanoes within its boundaries (along with [[Pilot Butte (Oregon)|Pilot Butte]] in [[Bend, Oregon]], [[Jackson Volcano]] in [[Jackson, Mississippi]], and [[Diamond Head, Hawaii|Diamond Head]] in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii). [[Mount Tabor, Portland, Oregon|Mount Tabor Park]] is known for its scenic views and historic reservoirs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mount Tabor Park|publisher=Portland Parks & Recreation|url=http://www.portlandonline.com/parks/finder/index.cfm?action=ViewPark&PropertyID=275|access-date=November 7, 2006}}</ref>

[[Washington Park (Portland, Oregon)|Washington Park]] is just west of downtown and is home to the [[Oregon Zoo]], [[Hoyt Arboretum]], the [[Portland Japanese Garden]], and the [[International Rose Test Garden]]. Portland is also home to [[Lan Su Chinese Garden]] (formerly the Portland Classical Chinese Garden), an authentic representation of a [[Suzhou]]-style walled garden. Portland's east side has several formal public gardens: the historic [[Peninsula Park]] Rose Garden, the rose gardens of [[Ladd's Addition]], the [[Crystal Springs Rhododendron Garden]], the [[Leach Botanical Garden]], and [[The Grotto (Portland, Oregon)|The Grotto]].

Portland's downtown features two groups of contiguous city blocks dedicated for park space: the [[North Park Blocks|North]] and [[South Park Blocks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/finder/index.cfm?action=ViewPark&PropertyID=447&searchtext=park%20blocks|title=North Park Blocks|website=The City of Portland, Oregon|access-date=May 11, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/finder/index.cfm?action=ViewPark&PropertyID=674&searchtext=park%20blocks|title=South Park Blocks|website=The City of Portland, Oregon|access-date=May 11, 2016}}</ref> The {{convert|37|acre|0|adj=on}} [[Tom McCall Waterfront Park]] was built in 1974 along the length of the downtown waterfront after [[Harbor Drive]] was removed; it now hosts large events throughout the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/finder/index.cfm?action=ViewFile&PolPdfsID=328&/Waterfront%20Park%20Master%20Plan.pdf|title=Waterfront Park Master Plan|website=Portland, Oregon|page=54|access-date=May 11, 2016}}</ref> The nearby historically significant [[Burnside Skatepark]] and five indoor [[skatepark]]s give Portland a reputation as possibly "the most skateboard-friendly town in America."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204119704574238073660408040|title=Skateboarding Capital of the World|last=Dougherty|first=Conor|date=July 30, 2009|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=July 31, 2009}}</ref>

==Government==
===City hall===
{{See also|Government of Portland, Oregon}}
[[File:PortlandCityHall.jpg|right|thumb|[[Portland City Hall (Oregon)|Portland City Hall]]]]

The city of Portland is governed by the Portland City Council, which includes a mayor, four commissioners, and an [[auditor]]. Each is elected citywide to serve a four-year term. Each commissioner oversees one or more bureaus responsible for the day-to-day operation of the city. The mayor serves as chairman of the council and is principally responsible for allocating department assignments to his fellow commissioners. The auditor provides checks and balances in the commission form of government and accountability for the use of public resources. In addition, the auditor provides access to information and reports on various matters of city government. Portland is the only large city left in the United States with the commission form of government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.portlandoregon.gov/auditor/article/9178|title=City Government Structure|publisher=City of Portland|access-date=March 3, 2019|quote=The City of Portland has the last remaining Commission form of government among large cities in the United States.}}</ref>

The city's Community & Civic Life (formerly Office of Neighborhood Involvement)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.portlandoregon.gov/civic/28363|title=Inside Civic Life {{!}} The City of Portland, Oregon|website=portlandoregon.gov|access-date=March 3, 2019}}</ref> serves as a conduit between city government and Portland's [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon|95 officially recognized neighborhoods]]. Each neighborhood is represented by a volunteer-based [[neighborhood association]] which serves as a liaison between residents of the neighborhood and the city government. The city provides funding to neighborhood associations through seven district coalitions, each of which is a geographical grouping of several neighborhood associations. Most (but not all) neighborhood associations belong to one of these district coalitions.

Portland and its surrounding metropolitan area are served by [[Metro (Oregon regional government)|Metro]], the United States' only directly elected [[metropolitan planning organization]]. Metro's charter gives it responsibility for [[land use]] and [[transportation planning]], [[solid waste management]], and map development.

The [[Multnomah County, Oregon|Multnomah County]] government provides many services to the Portland area, as do [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington]] and [[Clackamas County, Oregon|Clackamas]] counties to the west and south.

Fire and emergency services are provided by [[Portland Fire & Rescue]].

On November 8, 2022, Portland residents approved [[Government of Portland, Oregon#Charter Ammendment 2022|a charter reform]] ballot measure to replace the commission form of government with a 12-member council elected in four districts using the [[single transferable vote]] system, with a professional [[city manager]] appointed by a directly elected mayor. The city expects to hold the first election for this new system in 2024.<ref>{{Cite web|date=November 9, 2022|title=Portland voters approve charter reform, city launches transition {{!}} Portland.gov|url=https://www.portland.gov/transition/news/2022/11/9/portland-voters-approve-charter-reform-city-launches-transition|access-date=November 10, 2022|website=portland.gov}}</ref>

=== Courts and law enforcement ===
{{see also|Multnomah County Circuit Court}}

Law enforcement is provided by the [[Portland Police Bureau]].

===State and national politics===
Portland strongly favors the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]; registered Democrats (51.2%) outnumber [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] (10.5%) nearly 5 to 1. All city offices are [[non-partisan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandonline.com/Auditor/Index.cfm?a=9178&c=27481|work=Portland Online|title=City Government Structure|author=Caballero, Mary Hull|access-date=October 30, 2015}}</ref> However, almost all of the city's elected officials are known to be Democrats. [[Fred L. Peterson]] in 1952 is the city's last elected mayor who was known to be a Republican, and no Republican has served as mayor even on an interim basis since [[Connie McCready]] held the post from 1979 to 1980.

Portland is split among three of Oregon's U.S. [[congressional districts]]. Most of the city is in the [[Oregon's 3rd congressional district|3rd District]], represented by [[Earl Blumenauer]] (D-Portland), who served on the city council from 1986 until his election to Congress in 1996. Most of the city west of the Willamette River is part of the [[Oregon's 1st congressional district|1st District]], represented by [[Suzanne Bonamici]] (D-Beaverton). A small portion of southeastern Portland is in the [[Oregon's 5th congressional district|5th District]], formerly represented by [[Kurt Schrader]] (D-Canby) prior to losing his Democratic primary election to a more progressive candidate, but currently represented by the former mayor of [[Happy Valley, Oregon|Happy Valley]], Republican [[Lori Chavez-DeRemer]], who is the first [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to represent a significant portion of the city in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] since 1975. Both of Oregon's senators, [[Ron Wyden]] and [[Jeff Merkley]], are progressive Democrats from Portland.

In the [[United States presidential election in Oregon, 2008|2008 presidential election]], Democratic candidate [[Barack Obama]] easily carried Portland, winning 245,464 votes from city residents to 50,614 for his [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] rival, [[John McCain]]. In the [[United States presidential election in Oregon, 2012|2012 presidential election]], Democratic candidate [[Barack Obama]] again easily carried Portland, winning 256,925 votes from Multnomah county residents to 70,958 for his [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] rival, [[Mitt Romney]].<ref>{{cite web|work=The Oregonian|title=Oregon 2012 Election Results for Multnomah County|access-date=April 1, 2018|url=http://gov.oregonlive.com/election/2012/Multnomah/|archive-date=December 29, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229022748/https://gov.oregonlive.com/election/2012/Multnomah/}}</ref>

===City planning and development===

The original state rules included a provision for expanding urban growth boundaries, but critics felt this was not being accomplished. In 1995, the State passed a law requiring cities to expand UGBs to provide enough undeveloped land for a 20-year supply of future housing at projected growth levels.<ref>{{cite web|title=Comprehensive Land Use Planning Coordination|work=Legislative Counsel Committee of the Oregon Legislative Assembly|url=https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors197.html|access-date=January 28, 2019}}</ref> In 2007, the legislature changed the law to require the maintenance of an estimated 50 years of growth within the boundary, as well as the protection of accompanying farm and rural lands.<ref name="pt_growth" /> The growth boundary, along with efforts of the Portland Development Commission to create economic development zones, has led to the development of a large portion of downtown, a large number of mid- and high-rise developments, and an overall increase in housing and business density.<ref name="ssp_portland">{{cite web|title=Portland – SkyscraperPage|url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?cityID=29|access-date=June 4, 2008}}</ref>

[[Prosper Portland]] (formerly the Portland Development Commission) is a semi-public agency that plays a major role in downtown development; city voters created it in 1958 to serve as the city's [[urban renewal]] agency. It provides housing and economic development programs within the city and works behind the scenes with major local developers to create large projects. In the early 1960s, the Portland Development Commission led the razing of a large Italian-Jewish neighborhood downtown, bounded roughly by I-405, the Willamette River, 4th Avenue and Market street.<ref>{{cite web|work=Willamette Week|url=http://www.wweek.com/restaurants/2017/08/22/portland-once-had-a-thriving-little-italy-what-the-hell-happened/|title=Portland Once Had a Thriving Little Italy – What the Hell Happened?|access-date=April 1, 2018|author=Korfhage, Matthew|date=August 22, 2017}}</ref> Mayor [[Neil Goldschmidt]] took office in 1972 as a proponent of bringing housing and the associated vitality back to the downtown area, which was seen as emptying out after 5 pm. The effort has had dramatic effects in the 30 years since, with many thousands of new housing units clustered in three areas: north of Portland State University (between I-405, SW Broadway, and SW Taylor St.); the RiverPlace development along the waterfront under the Marquam (I-5) bridge; and most notably in the Pearl District (between I-405, Burnside St., NW Northrup St., and NW 9th Ave.).
