Formally established in 1820, Syracuse was named after the classical Greek city [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] (''Siracusa'' in Italian), a city on the eastern coast of the Italian island of [[Sicily]], for its similar natural features. It has historically functioned as a major [[Intersection (road)|crossroads]], first between the [[Erie Canal]] and its branch canals, then of the [[Rail transport in the United States|railway network]]. Today, the city is at the intersection of Interstates [[Interstate 81|81]] and [[Interstate 90|90]], and its [[Syracuse Hancock International Airport|airport]] is the largest in [[Central New York]], a five-county region of over one million inhabitants.

Syracuse is the economic and educational hub of Central New York. It hosts a number of convention sites, including a large [[Oncenter|downtown convention complex]], and is home to prominent institutions such as [[Syracuse University]], [[SUNY Upstate Medical University]], [[SUNY ESF]], and [[Le Moyne College]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of Syracuse, New York}}
French missionaries were the first Europeans to come to this area, arriving to work with and convert the Native Americans in the mid-17th century. At the invitation of the [[Onondaga Nation]], one of the five nations of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]], a Jesuit priest by the name of [[Simon Le Moyne]], accompanied by soldiers and [[coureurs des bois]], including [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson|Pierre Esprit Radisson]], set up a mission, known as [[Sainte Marie among the Iroquois|''Ste. Marie de Gannentaha'']], on the northeast shore of [[Onondaga Lake]].

Jesuit missionaries reported salty brine springs around the southern end of what they referred to as "Salt Lake", known today as Onondaga Lake in honor of the historic tribe. French fur traders established trade throughout the New York area among the Iroquois. Dutch and English colonists also were traders, and the English nominally claimed the area, from their upstate base at [[Albany, New York]]. During the [[American Revolutionary War]], the highly decentralized Iroquois divided into groups and bands that supported the British, and two tribes that supported the American-born rebels, or patriots.

Settlers came into central and western New York from eastern parts of the state and New England after the American Revolutionary War and various treaties with and land sales by Native American tribes.<ref>See [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784)]]</ref> The subsequent designation of this area by the state of New York as the Onondaga Salt Springs Reservation provided the basis for commercial salt production. Such production took place from the late 1700s through the early 1900s. Brine from wells that tapped into halite (common salt) beds in the Salina shale near [[Tully, New York]], 15 miles south of the city, was developed in the 19th century.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Crossroads in Time|last=Connors|first=Dennis J.|publisher=Onondaga Historical Association|year=2006|isbn=0-8156-8149-6|location=Syracuse|pages=17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Yager|first1=Richard M.|last2=Kappel|first2=William M.|last3=Plummer|first3=L.

The rapid development of this industry in the 18th and 19th centuries led to the nicknaming of this area as "The Salt City".

The original settlement of Syracuse was a conglomeration of several small towns and villages and was not recognized with a post office by the [[United States Government]]. Establishing the post office was delayed because the settlement did not have a name. Joshua Forman wanted to name the village [[Corinth (village), New York|Corinth]]. When [[John Wilkinson (Syracuse pioneer)|John Wilkinson]] applied for a post office in that name in 1820, it was denied because the same name was already in use in [[Saratoga County, New York]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shadesofoakwood.com/pages/syrhist.html|title=Early History of Syracuse|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830222145/http://shadesofoakwood.com/pages/syrhist.html|archive-date=August 30, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Having read a poetic description of [[Syracuse, Sicily]] (Siracusa), Wilkinson saw similarities to the lake and salt springs of this area, which had both "salt and freshwater mingling together".<ref>{{Cite news|date=April 13, 1921|title=Syracuse Formed as Village 96 Years Ago Today|newspaper=Syracuse Herald-Journal}}</ref> On February 4, 1820, Wilkinson proposed the name "Syracuse" to a group of fellow townsmen; it became the name of the village and the new post office.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sites.rootsweb.com/~nyononda/SYRACUSE/SYRTELPC.HTM|title=Historical Sketch of the "Central City," and the Importance of the Bell System in Its Business and Social Life|last=Cleaves|first=L.L.|date=June 1912|access-date=November 26, 2021|archive-date=March 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308113646/http://sites.rootsweb.com/~nyononda/SYRACUSE/SYRTELPC.HTM|url-status=live}}</ref>

The first [[Solvay Process Company]] plant in the United States was erected on the southwestern shore of Onondaga Lake in 1884. The village was called [[Solvay, New York|Solvay]] to commemorate the inventor [[Ernest Solvay]]. In 1861, he developed the [[ammonia-soda process]] for the manufacture of soda ash (anhydrous sodium carbonate) from brine wells dug in the southern end of [[Tully, New York|Tully]] valley (as a source of sodium chloride) and limestone (as a source of calcium carbonate). The process was an improvement over the earlier Leblanc process. The Syracuse Solvay plant was the incubator for a large chemical industry complex owned by [[AlliedSignal|Allied Signal]] in Syracuse. While this industry stimulated development and provided many jobs in Syracuse, it left Onondaga Lake as the most polluted in the nation.

The salt industry declined after the Civil War, but a new manufacturing industry arose in its place. Throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s, numerous businesses and stores were established, including the [[Franklin (automobile)|Franklin Automobile Company]], which produced the first air-cooled engine in the world; the [[Century Motor Vehicle Company]]; the [[Smith Corona]] company; and the Craftsman Workshops, the center of [[Gustav Stickley]]'s handmade furniture empire.

On March 24, 1870, Syracuse University was founded. The State of New York granted the new university its own charter, independent of [[Genesee College]], which had unsuccessfully tried to move to Syracuse the year before.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.syr.edu/history/founding_su.html|title=Syracuse University History: History of the Founding of Syracuse University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927002226/http://archives.syr.edu/history/founding_su.html|archive-date=September 27, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> The university was founded as coeducational.

In the College of Liberal Arts, the ratio between male and female students during the 19th century was approximately even. The College of Fine Arts was predominantly female, and a low ratio of women enrolled in the College of Medicine and the College of Law.<ref name=":1" />

The first [[Great New York State Fair|New York State Fair]] was held in Syracuse in 1841.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://nysfair.ny.gov/about/fair-history/|title=State Fair History|website=The Great New York State Fair|publisher=New York State Government|access-date=October 13, 2016|archive-date=October 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011025800/http://nysfair.ny.gov/about/fair-history/|url-status=live}}</ref> Between 1842 and 1889, the Fair was held among 11 New York cities before finding a permanent home in Syracuse. It has been an annual event since then, except between 1942 and 1947, when the grounds were used as a military base during World War II,<ref name=":0" /> and in 2020, due to the outbreak of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].

As part of the racial incidents happening all over the country during the [[Red Summer|1919 Red Summer]], on July 31, 1919, there was a [[Syracuse riot of 1919|violent riot]] between white and black workers of the Syracuse Globe Malleable Iron Works.

Syracuse is home to the only "green on top" [[traffic light]]. The "green on top" traffic light was installed in 1928 as a result of local youths throwing rocks at the "British red" light that was originally on top. These locals became known as "stonethrowers" and the neighborhood now has the [[Tipperary Hill Heritage Memorial]] on the corner of Tompkins Street and Milton Avenue to commemorate this history.<ref>{{Cite web|date=March 3, 2017|title=How the Irish changed the traffic laws in Tipperary Hill, Syracuse|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/How-the-Irish-changed-the-traffic-laws-in-Tipperary-Hill-Syracuse.html|access-date=April 29, 2021|website=IrishCentral.com|language=en|archive-date=August 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811183929/http://www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/How-the-Irish-changed-the-traffic-laws-in-Tipperary-Hill-Syracuse.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

World War II stimulated significant industrial expansion in the area: of specialty steel, fasteners, and custom machining. After the war, two of the Big Three automobile manufacturers ([[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]]) had major operations in the area. Syracuse was also headquarters for [[Carrier Corporation]], and [[Crouse-Hinds Company|Crouse-Hinds]] manufactured traffic signals in the city. [[General Electric]], with its headquarters in [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] to the east, had its main television manufacturing plant at Electronics Parkway in Syracuse.

The manufacturing industry in Syracuse began to falter in the 1970s, as the industry restructured nationwide. Many small businesses failed during this time, which contributed to the already increasing unemployment rate. Rockwell International moved its factory outside New York state. General Electric moved its television manufacturing operations to [[Suffolk, Virginia]], and later offshore to Asia. The Carrier Corporation moved its headquarters out of Syracuse, relocated its manufacturing operations out of state, and outsourced some of its production to Asian facilities. Although the city population has declined since 1950, the Syracuse metropolitan area population has remained fairly stable, growing by 2.5% since 1970. While this growth rate is greater than much of Upstate New York, it is far below the national average during that period.

The Syracuse Community Grid project is a 2023 highway teardown project taking place in Downtown Syracuse, with the goal of improving the city.<ref>{{Cite news |title=I-81Community grid gets final approval from the feds, Construction begins this fall |work=CNYCentral |url=https://cnycentral.com/news/local/i-81-community-grid-gets-final-approval-from-feds-construction-begins-this-fall}}</ref>

== Geography ==
Syracuse is located at {{Coord|43|2|49|N|76|8|40|W|type:city|display=inline}} (43.046899, −76.144423).<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990|archive-date=August 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190824085937/https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|url-status=live}}</ref> It is located about {{convert|87|mi|km|-1}} east of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], {{convert|150|mi|km|-1}} east of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], and {{convert|145|mi|km|-1}} west of the state capital, [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. It is also the halfway point between New York City and [[Toronto]], about {{convert|245|mi|km|-1}} from each, Toronto to the northwest and NYC to the southeast.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|25.6|mi2|km2|abbr=off|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|25.1|mi2|km2|abbr=off|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.6|mi2|km2|abbr=off|order=flip}} (2.15%) water.

The city developed at the northeast corner of the [[Finger Lakes]] region. The city has many neighborhoods that were originally independent villages, which joined the city over the years. Although the central part of Syracuse is flat, many of its neighborhoods are on small hills such as [[University Hill, Syracuse|University Hill]] and [[Tipperary Hill]]. Land to the north of Syracuse is generally flat, while land to the south is hilly.

About 27% of Syracuse's land area is covered by 890,000 trees&nbsp;— a higher percentage than in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], or [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. The [[New York State Labor Day Derechos|Labor Day Storm]] of 1998 was a [[derecho]] that destroyed approximately 30,000 trees. The [[sugar maple]] accounts for 14.2% of Syracuse's trees, followed by the [[Northern white cedar]] (9.8%) and the [[Buckthorn|European buckthorn]] (6.8%). The most common street tree is the [[Norway maple]] (24.3%), followed by the [[honey locust]] (9.3%).

The densest tree cover in Syracuse is in the two Valley neighborhoods, where 46.6% of the land is covered by trees. The lowest tree cover percentage is found in the densely developed [[Downtown Syracuse|downtown]], which has only 4.6% trees.<ref>Weiner, Mark: "Census of trees sees healthy population – Syracuse, one of Upstate's leafiest cities, is coming back after the devastating [[New York State Labor Day derechos|1998 Labor Day storm]]", ''[[Post-Standard]]'', April 27, 2001</ref>

[[Onondaga Creek]], a waterway that runs through downtown, flows northward through the city. The [[Onondaga Creekwalk]] borders this, connecting the [[Lakefront, Syracuse|Lakefront]], [[Inner Harbor, Syracuse|Inner Harbor]], [[Franklin Square, Syracuse|Franklin Square]] and [[Armory Square]] neighborhoods. The creek continues through the [[North Valley, Syracuse|Valley]] and ultimately to the [[Onondaga Nation]]. The creek is navigable, but it can be a challenge. Its channelized nature speeds up its flow, particularly in the spring, when it may be dangerous. After some youngsters drowned in the creek, some residential areas fenced-off the creek in their neighborhoods.<gallery mode="packed">

{{Further|15th Ward (Syracuse, New York)|label1=15th Ward}}

The City of Syracuse officially recognizes 26 [[Neighbourhood|neighborhoods]] within its boundaries. Some of these have small additional neighborhoods and districts inside of them. In addition, Syracuse also owns and operates [[Syracuse Hancock International Airport]] on the territory of four towns north of the city.

Syracuse's neighborhoods reflect the historically ethnic and multicultural population. Traditionally, Irish, Polish and Ukrainian Americans settled on its west side (see [[Tipperary Hill]]); Jewish Americans on its east side; German and Italian Americans on the north side; and African-Americans on its south side. In recent years, large numbers of refugees from the Middle East have settled mainly on the north side as well.

[[File:Syracuse Weather Statistics.png|thumb|right|Syracuse's weather averages]]
Syracuse has a [[hot-summer humid continental climate]] (''[[Köppen climate classification|Dfa]]''), as mean July temperatures are just above the {{cvt|71.6|°F}} threshold needed for a hot-summer climate. The city is known for its high snowfall, {{convert|115.6|in|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} on average;<ref>"[https://web.archive.org/web/20020219075528/http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/online/ccd/snowfall.html Snowfall – Average Total In Inches]", [[NOAA]], June 23, 2004</ref> Syracuse receives the most annual average snow of any metropolitan area in the United States.<ref>Cappella, Chris: "[https://www.usatoday.com/weather/resources/askjack/2003-10-01-snowiest-cities_x.htm Answers: 10 snowiest 'cities' aren't all in New York] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012221017/http://www.usatoday.com/weather/resources/askjack/2003-10-01-snowiest-cities_x.htm |date=October 12, 2011 }}", ''[[USA Today]]'', October 3, 2003</ref><ref>Kirst, Sean: "We won't buckle under the Snowbelt's blows", ''[[Post-Standard]]'', March 14, 2005</ref> Syracuse usually wins the [[Golden Snowball Award]] among Upstate cities. Its record seasonal (July 1 to June 30 of the following year) snowfall so far is {{convert|192.1|in|m|abbr=on}} during the winter of 1992–93, while the snowiest calendar month was January 2004, with {{convert|78.1|in|m|abbr=on}} accumulated.<ref name="NWS Binghamton, NY" /> The high snowfall is a result of the city receiving both heavy snow from the [[lake effect snow|lake effect]] of nearby [[Lake Ontario]] (of the Great Lakes) and [[nor'easter]] snow from storms driven from the Atlantic Ocean. Snow most often falls in small (about {{convert|1|-|3|in|cm|abbr=off|disp=or}}), almost daily doses, over a period of several days. Larger snowfalls do occur occasionally, and even more so in the northern suburbs.

The [[Storm of the Century (1993)|Blizzard of 1993]] was described as the Storm of the Century. Some {{convert|42.9|in|cm|abbr=on}} fell on the city within 48 hours, with {{convert|35.6|in|cm|abbr=on}} falling within the first 24 hours. Syracuse received more snow than any other city in the country during this storm, which shattered a total of eight local records, including the most snow in a single snowstorm.<ref>Staff Reports: "A Storm for the records – Blizzard of 1993 brought 42.9 inches", ''[[Post-Standard]]'', December 31, 2003</ref> A second notable snowfall was the [[Blizzard of 1966]], with {{convert|42.3|in|cm|abbr=on}}. The Blizzard of '58 occurred in February (16–17th) across Oswego and Onondaga counties. This storm was classified as a blizzard due to the high winds, blowing snow, and cold; {{convert|26.1|in|cm|abbr=on}} of snow was measured at Syracuse and drifts reached {{convert|20|ft|abbr=on}} in Oswego County.

Syracuse on average receives an annual precipitation of {{convert|38.47|in|mm|abbr=off|sp=us}}, with the months of July through September being the wettest in terms of total precipitation,<ref name="NWS Binghamton, NY" /> while precipitation occurs on more days each month during the snow season.<ref name="NCDC text KSYR" />

The normal monthly mean temperature ranges from {{convert|23.6|F|1}} in January to {{convert|71.3|F|1}} in July.<ref name="NWS Binghamton, NY" /> The record high of {{convert|102|F|0}} was recorded on July 9, 1936, and the record low of {{convert|-26|F|0}} has occurred three times since 1942, the last being February 18, 1979.<ref name="NWS Binghamton, NY" />

In the early 21st century, a handful of previous heat records have been broken in the city. For example, July 2020 became the hottest month on record, with a mean temperature of {{convert|77.1|F|1}}, while the summers (June–August) of 2005, 2020, and 2012 were, respectively, the hottest, third-hottest, and fourth-hottest summers on record.<ref name="xmacis">{{cite web |url=http://xmacis.rcc-acis.org/ |title=xmACIS2 |publisher=NOAA Regional Climate Centers |access-date=August 24, 2020 |quote=Use "Seasonal Time Series" or "Extremes" |archive-date=August 15, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815183401/http://xmacis.rcc-acis.org/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=August 31, 2020|title=CNY's hot, hot summer fell just short of record-breaking|url=https://www.syracuse.com/weather/2020/08/cnys-hot-hot-summer-fell-just-short-of-record-breaking.html|access-date=December 21, 2020|website=syracuse|language=en|archive-date=April 18, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210418181819/https://www.syracuse.com/weather/2020/08/cnys-hot-hot-summer-fell-just-short-of-record-breaking.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Additionally, 2017 and 2018 saw consecutive monthly high temperature records broken in February, of {{convert|71|F}} on February 24, 2017,<ref name="warmfebs">{{cite news|author=Glenn Coin|date=February 21, 2018|title=Syracuse is basking in its warmest February day on record|work=syracuse.com|url=http://www.syracuse.com/weather/index.ssf/2018/02/syracuse_just_tied_for_the_warmest_february_day_on_record.html|access-date=May 14, 2018|archive-date=May 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514141920/http://www.syracuse.com/weather/index.ssf/2018/02/syracuse_just_tied_for_the_warmest_february_day_on_record.html|url-status=live}}</ref> and {{convert|75|F}} on February 21, 2018,<ref name="warmestfeb" /> in addition to four consecutive days at or above {{convert|60|F}}.<ref name="warmfebs" /> The latter was the warmest winter day on record.<ref name="warmestfeb">{{cite news |url=http://www.syracuse.com/weather/index.ssf/2018/02/today_is_warmest_winter_day_in_syracuse_in_at_least_115_years.html |title=Today is warmest winter day in Syracuse in at least 115 years |date=February 21, 2018 |author=Glenn Coin |access-date=May 14, 2018 |archive-date=May 14, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514141815/http://www.syracuse.com/weather/index.ssf/2018/02/today_is_warmest_winter_day_in_syracuse_in_at_least_115_years.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Assembly of God]], the American Baptist Churches of the US, the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], and the [[United Church of Christ]] are other Protestant denominations, and they have their state offices in the Greater Syracuse area. The dozens of churches in Syracuse include Seventh-Day Adventist, [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Jehovah's Witness]], [[Christian Science]], [[RPCNA|Reformed Presbyterian]], and Metaphysical Christian.

'''[[Buddhism]]:''' Buddhism is represented by the [[Zen Center of Syracuse]] on the Seneca Turnpike; as well as a center on Park Street, on the city's Northside.

== Economy ==
[[File:SUNY Upstate Medical University, Upstate University Hospital.jpg|thumb|[[State University of New York Upstate Medical University]] located in Downtown Syracuse.]]
Formerly a manufacturing center, Syracuse's economy has faced challenges over the past decades as industrial jobs have left the area. The number of local and state government jobs also has been declining for several years. Syracuse's top employers now are primarily in higher education, research, health care and [[service industry|services]]; some high-tech manufacturing remains. [[University Hill, Syracuse|University Hill]] is Syracuse's fastest-growing neighborhood, fueled by expansions by [[Syracuse University]] and [[State University of New York Upstate Medical University|Upstate Medical University]] (a division of the [[State University of New York]]), as well as dozens of small medical office complexes.

=== Business districts ===
In addition to the dominant [[Destiny USA]] shopping mall in Syracuse's Lakefront neighborhood, many of the city's more traditional neighborhoods continue to have active business districts:

* '''[[Downtown Syracuse|Downtown]]:''' [[Armory Square]] has replaced South Salina Street as the main retail and dining area of Downtown Syracuse.

Similarly, but on a smaller scale, there is the [[Hanover Square, Syracuse|Hanover Square]] area.
* '''[[Eastwood, Syracuse|Eastwood]]:''' Calling itself "the village within the city", this former village still has a retail corridor along James Street.
* '''[[Little Italy, Syracuse|Little Italy]]:''' A neighborhood with Italian origins, Little Italy (part of the [[Near Northeast, Syracuse|Near Northeast]] neighborhood) has several blocks of bakeries, restaurants, pizzerias, shops, and services. Before large-scale Italian immigration, this neighbourhood was heavily populated by German immigrants.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Koch |first=Daniel |date=2022 |title=Working-Class Germans in the Salt City: Syracuse, New York, 1860–1916 |journal=New York History |volume=103 |issue=2 |pages=361–376|doi=10.1353/nyh.2022.0043 |s2cid=257206983 }}</ref>
*'''[[Sedgwick, Syracuse|Sedgwick Farms]]:''' An affluent neighborhood on the northeast side of the city near Eastwood containing many architecturally-distinct, large, classic homes including a [[Sears Home]]<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Gloria|last2=Post-St|first2=The|last3=ard|date=May 28, 2011|title=Syracuse house, which came from a Sears catalog, is one of only seven of its kind in U.S.|url=https://www.syracuse.com/news/2011/05/syracuse_house_which_came_from.html|access-date=September 29, 2021|website=syracuse|language=en|archive-date=September 29, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210929212359/https://www.syracuse.com/news/2011/05/syracuse_house_which_came_from.html|url-status=live}}</ref> designed by many noted architects. The neighborhood has historically been home to city leaders, state politicians, and leaders in Syracuse's industry and economy. 
*'''[[Strathmore, Syracuse|Strathmore]]:''' A neighborhood on the southwest of the city that largely features well-maintained older, residential homes, including some designed by [[Ward Wellington Ward]]. There are several buildings listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The neighborhood is anchored by [[Hiawatha lake]] in [[Onondaga Park]].
* '''[[University Hill, Syracuse|University Hill]]:''' [[Marshall Street, Syracuse|Marshall Street]], along with its terminus South Crouse Avenue, is lined with stores, bars, and restaurants, primarily catering to the student population on "The Hill", as well as the over 25,000 people who work there daily. East Genesee Street at the northwestern corner of the neighborhood has several retail establishments, as well.
* '''[[Westcott, Syracuse|Westcott]]:''' This neighborhood east of University Hill is inhabited by a wide variety of people, increasingly including some college students as the university grows but still primarily local families and residents. Single-family homes and two-unit apartments comprise the majority of housing. Westcott is known as a bohemian and liberal quarter, and each September hosts the Westcott Street Cultural Fair. The main business district is on Westcott Street between Beech and Dell streets and includes restaurants, bars, a consignment shop, and other businesses.

Syracuse University sports are by far the most attended sporting events in the Syracuse area. Basketball games often draw over 30,000 fans, and football games over 40,000. The university has bred dozens of famous professional players since starting an athletics program in the late nineteenth century, including all-time greats [[Ernie Davis]], [[Jim Brown]], [[Larry Csonka]] and [[Dave Bing]]. Both teams play in the [[JMA Wireless Dome]].

In addition to many former professional minor league teams, Syracuse was previously the home of several top-level pro teams, most notably the [[History of the Philadelphia 76ers#1946–1963: Syracuse Nationals|Syracuse Nationals]] who played a total of 17 seasons between the [[National Basketball League (United States)|NBL]] and [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], and won the [[1955 NBA Finals]] before moving to [[Philadelphia]] and becoming the [[Philadelphia 76ers]]. Syracuse was also the home of two different [[Major League Baseball]] teams: the [[Syracuse Stars (National League)|Syracuse Stars]] of the [[National League (baseball)|National League]] in 1879, which did not finish their first season; and the [[Syracuse Stars (American Association)|Syracuse Stars]] of the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] in 1890.

=== Television ===
{{See also|Category:Television stations in Syracuse, New York}}
According to [[Nielsen Media Research]], Syracuse is the fifth largest television market in New York State and the 87th largest in the United States (as of the 2020–2021 TV season).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://mediatracks.com/resources/nielsen-dma-rankings-2021/ |title=Nielsen DMA Rankings 2021 |access-date=November 26, 2021 |archive-date=May 25, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210525173958/https://mediatracks.com/resources/nielsen-dma-rankings-2021/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Six major full-power stations serve the city: [[WSTM-TV]] 3 ([[NBC]]), [[WTVH]] 5 ([[CBS]]), [[WSYR-TV]] 9 ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]), [[WCNY-TV]] 24/cable 11 ([[PBS]]), [[WSPX-TV]] 56/cable 4 ([[ION Television|Ion]]), and [[WSYT]] 68/cable 8 ([[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]). WSTM-TV also operates the area's [[The CW|CW]] affiliate on its DT2 subchannel and cable channel 6, and WSYT carries the [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliation on channel 43 and cable channel 7; both stations were previously [[WSTQ-LP|separately]]-[[WNYS-TV|licensed]] stations before having their licenses returned to the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]].

Additionally, networks such as [[Cornerstone Television]] channel 11 & 22, [[Univision]], and [[MTV2]] are broadcast by [[Low-power broadcasting|low-power television stations]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnymedia.com/transmitters.cfm?Band=TV&Market=Syracuse|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050220045743/http://www.cnymedia.com/transmitters.cfm?Band=TV&Market=Syracuse|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 20, 2005|title=CNY Media: Syracuse TV Stations Transmitters|date=February 20, 2005}}</ref>

[[Syracuse University]]'s student-run TV station is [[CitrusTV]]. CitrusTV programming is broadcast on the university campus on the Orange Television Network.

Syracuse's cable television provider is [[Charter Communications|Charter Spectrum]] (Charter Communications acquired Time Warner Cable in 2016), which, as a part of its regular and digital offerings, provides a 24-hour local news channel ([[Spectrum News Central New York]]), [[public access television|public access channel]], and an additional [[PBS]] channel. Several suburbs also have access to [[Verizon Fios]] for cable television. [[Dish Network]] and [[DirecTV]] also provide local satellite television subscribers with local broadcast stations.

=== Newspapers ===
Syracuse has one major daily morning newspaper, ''[[The Post-Standard]]''. Until 2001, Syracuse also had an evening paper, ''[[The Syracuse Herald-Journal|The Herald-Journal]]''. It focuses on local news throughout Central New York, and has a reporter in Washington, DC.

Before the merger with the evening paper, the ''Post-Standard'' was named among the "10 best newspapers in America with a circulation of under 100,000" by [[Al Neuharth]] of ''[[USA Today]]'' (run by a competing organization). Since the merger, circulation has increased to over 120,000. Even outside of its four-county delivery area, the paper is available in many convenience stores and supermarkets from the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]] to the New York–[[Pennsylvania]] border. The newspaper partly caters to this audience as well, covering many stories from the [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], [[Utica, New York|Utica]], and [[Watertown, New York|Watertown]] areas. Since opening a new printing press in 2002, the paper calls itself "America's Most Colorful Newspaper," as almost every page contains color.

''[[The Daily Orange]]'', the newspaper of [[Syracuse University]] and [[SUNY ESF]] students, is read by over 20,000 people daily, and is widely distributed in the [[University Hill, Syracuse|University Hill]] neighborhood and [[Armory Square]]. ''The Dolphin'', the weekly student newspaper of [[Le Moyne College]] is also available, read mainly by Le Moyne students.

There are other popular free newspapers, including ''[[Eagle Newspapers (New York)|Eagle Newspaper]]'''s downtown edition, the ''City Eagle'', and ''Table Hopping'', which focuses on the restaurant and entertainment scene. Additionally, a weekly newspaper, CNY Vision, publishes news and information focusing on Syracuse's African American community.

A Hispanic-based monthly publication, called the CNY Latino newspaper, is published in Syracuse by the CNY Latino Media Consortium in both paper and online formats, and covers an area from Rochester to Albany and Watertown to Binghamton.

[[File:First copy of The Daily Orange Newspaper.pdf|thumb|[[The Daily Orange]]]]

=== Magazines ===
The Syracuse area is covered in a regional lifestyle publication called ''The Good Life, Central New York Magazine'', mostly known as ''Central New York Magazine''. The magazine is bi-monthly (six issues per year) and offers print + digital and digital only subscriptions; it covers the greater Syracuse and Central New York area.

Central New York Magazine premiered in May 2006 and tells "positive and uniquely CNY stories." Coverage areas include local shops and small businesses, regional travel destinations, food and drink, home décor, attractions and things to do, artisans, changemakers, and area trends.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Transportation ===

==== Public transit ====
Syracuse is served by the [[Central New York Regional Transportation Authority]], or Centro. Centro operates bus service in Syracuse and its suburbs, as well as to outlying metropolitan area cities such as [[Auburn, New York|Auburn]], [[Fulton, Oswego County, New York|Fulton]], and [[Oswego, New York|Oswego]].

'''Proposed public transit projects'''

In 2005, local millionaire Tom McDonald proposed an [[aerial tramway]] system, called Salt City Aerial Transit (S.C.A.T.), to link the university to the transportation center. The first segment from Syracuse University to downtown was estimated to cost $5&nbsp;million, which McDonald planned to raise himself. Due to perceived low operating costs, the system was envisioned as running continuously.<ref>{{cite news |first=Rick |last=Moriarty |title=High flying idea stuck |work=[[The Post-Standard]] |date=September 26, 2006 }}</ref>

==== Rail ====
Syracuse ([[Amtrak station code|station stop code]] SYR) is served by [[Amtrak]]'s [[Empire Service (transport)|Empire Service]], [[Lake Shore Limited]], and [[Maple Leaf (Amtrak)|Maple Leaf]] lines. Amtrak's station is part of the [[William F. Walsh Regional Transportation Center]].

The Empire Service runs twice daily in each direction between [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls, NY]] and [[New York Penn Station]], with major stops in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], Syracuse, [[Utica, New York|Utica]], and [[Albany, New York|Albany]] along the way. The Maple Leaf runs once daily in each direction, and follows the same route as the Empire Service, however instead of terminating in Niagara Falls, it continues on to Toronto.

[[Empire Service]] and [[Maple Leaf (train)|Maple Leaf]] trains stop at the seasonal [[New York State Fair station|New York State Fair – NYF station]] during the [[New York State Fair]]'s annual run each August. The NYF Station is located along the southern part of the fairgrounds, near the historic train car display of the Central New York Chapter, of the [[National Railway Historical Society]].

The Lake Shore Limited runs once daily in each direction between [[Chicago Union Station|Chicago]] and [[South Station|Boston]] or New York City (via two sections splitting [[Albany–Rensselaer station|Albany-Rensselaer]]). It follows the same route as the Empire Service and Maple Leaf between New York City and [[Buffalo–Depew station|Buffalo-Depew]], where it diverges and continues on through [[Cleveland]] and [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] to Chicago.

A regional commuter rail service, [[OnTrack]], was active from 1994 until it was discontinued in 2007 due to low ridership. Its sole route connected the [[Carousel Center]] to southern Syracuse, often extending to [[Jamesville, New York|Jamesville]] in the summer.

==== Bus ====
[[Greyhound Lines]], [[Megabus (North America)|Megabus]], [[OurBus]], and [[Trailways]] provide long-distance bus service to destinations including New York City, Boston, Buffalo, Albany, and Toronto. Greyhound, Megabus, and Trailways use the [[William F. Walsh Regional Transportation Center]] in the northern area of the city, while OurBus stops near the campus of Syracuse University.

==== Air service ====
Syracuse is served by the [[Syracuse Hancock International Airport]] in nearby [[Salina, New York|Salina]], near [[Mattydale, New York|Mattydale]]. The airport is named after [[Clarence E. Hancock]], a former US Congressman representing Syracuse. The airport is served by 8 major airlines, which provide non-stop flights to important airline hubs and business centers such as [[Atlanta]], [[Boston]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], Chicago, Detroit, [[Denver]], [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Ft. Lauderdale]], [[New York, New York|New York City]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Tampa Bay, Florida|Tampa]], Washington, DC, as well as connecting service to 147 foreign cities in 87 countries. Cargo carriers [[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] also serve the airport. [[New York, New York|New York City]] can be reached in under an hour flight. The City of Syracuse owns the airport and property, while a public for-benefit corporation runs the airport, the Syracuse Regional Airport Authority. The airport is protected by the 174th Attack Wing's Fire Department, and patrolled by Syracuse Airport Police Department officers.

==== Major highways and roads ====
* [[File:I-81.svg|22px]] [[Interstate 81 in New York|Interstate 81]] runs north–south through Syracuse, and provides access to Canada, [[Pennsylvania]] and points south. Its [[Downtown Syracuse|downtown]] portion is extremely narrow, only consisting of four lanes and few onramps. The highway was known as the Penn-Can Expressway when first built, leading to the [[Penn-Can Mall]] and other similarly named developments. It will soon be rerouted to follow I-481's route around the city instead of going through downtown. The current route will be designated as Interstate 81 Business.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |title=US Route Number Applications, American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, Accessed September 8, 2021 |url=https://route.transportation.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/50/2021/08/USRN-Applications_Compiled_2021.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210908231157/https://route.transportation.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/50/2021/08/USRN-Applications_Compiled_2021.pdf |archive-date=September 8, 2021 |access-date=September 8, 2021}}</ref>
* [[File:I-90.svg|22px]] [[Interstate 90 in New York|Interstate 90]], signed as the [[New York State Thruway]] within New York State, runs east–west, just north of the city. It is a [[toll road|toll highway]] that provides access to [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]], and the north–south ([[Interstate 87 (New York)|Interstate 87]]) part of the Thruway leads to [[New York, New York|New York City]].
* [[File:I-690.svg|25px]] [[Interstate 690]] runs east–west through the city, and provides access to Interstate 90, as well as to Syracuse's northwestern and eastern suburbs. A spur off I-690 directly west of the city, [[New York State Route 695|NY 695]], provides freeway access to the southwestern suburbs. It meets Interstate 81 in downtown Syracuse in a highly complex and incomplete intersection. Most of its routing through the city directly replaced the former elevated rail lines of the [[New York Central Railroad|New York Central]] four-track [[Main line (railway)|mainline]], a fact quite notable by the city's former main rail terminal, where the freeway spans the width between the terminal and its outermost platform. In 1981, artist Duke Epolito erected sculptures of "passengers" on the single remaining passenger platform. The piece is entitled "Waiting for the Night Train."<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2009/12/mystery_santas_helper_each_yea.html|title = Mystery Santa's helper each year puts the red scarves on statues along I-690|last = Case|first = Dick|date = December 20, 2009|work = The Post-Standard|access-date = November 13, 2015|publisher = Syracuse Media Group|archive-date = November 17, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117025912/http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2009/12/mystery_santas_helper_each_yea.html|url-status = live}}</ref>
* [[File:I-481.svg|25px]] [[Interstate 481]] forms an eastern loop around the city and continues to the northwest as [[New York State Route 481|NY 481]] to [[Fulton, Oswego County, New York|Fulton]] and [[Oswego, New York|Oswego]], on the shore of [[Lake Ontario]]. The highway was built to provide rapid access to eastern suburbs after the affluent community members in [[Manlius, New York|Manlius]] and [[Fayetteville, New York|Fayetteville]] squashed the original design to extend [[Interstate 690]] to serve the eastern suburbs. The highway is soon to be replaced in designation by Interstate 81.<ref name=":3" />

'''Community Grid'''

In late May, 2023, The Community Grid project was officially approved for construction in the Syracuse. The highly controversial plan consists of removing the I-81 viaduct that runs through the downtown of the city, and replacing it with the [[Boulevard]] style Business Loop-81. The heavily congested [[Interstate 81 in New York|Interstate-81]] will be re-routed around the city onto the already existing [[Interstate 481|Interstate-481]]. This project is estimated to cost around 2.25 billion dollars, and will be completed over a multi-year process.<ref>{{Cite news |date=May 31, 2022 |title=I-81 Community Grid Gets Final Approval From Feds |work=CNYCentral |url=https://cnycentral.com/news/local/i-81-community-grid-gets-final-approval-from-feds-construction-begins-this-fall}}</ref> Construction has already begun in portions of North Syracuse at the I-81 and I-481 interchange.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Here's what the first part of Syracuse's community grid will look like. |work=CNYCentral |url=https://www.syracuse.com/news/2022/06/heres-what-the-first-part-of-syracuses-i-81-construction-will-look-like-maps.html?outputType=amp}}</ref>

'''Two [[United States Highway System|US Highways]] run through the Syracuse area:'''

* [[File:US 11.svg|22px]] [[U.S. Route 11 in New York|U.S. Highway 11]] ([[Quebec Route 223|Route 223]] in Quebec to [[New Orleans]]) runs north–south through Syracuse, including downtown, and it follows Salina, State, and Wolf Streets.
* [[File:US 20.svg|22px]] [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|U.S. Highway 20]] (Boston to [[Newport, Oregon]]) passes south of Syracuse.

'''[[New York State Highways|New York State Route]] Expressways:'''

* [[File:NY-481.svg|25px]] [[New York State Route 481]] travels from [[NY 104]] in Oswego to the terminus of Interstate 481 north of Syracuse.
* [[File:NY-690.svg|25px]] [[New York State Route 690]] was built as an extension of Interstate 690 to serve the northwest suburbs of Syracuse. The route is a four-lane divided highway from its southern end at I-690, where it meets Interstate 90 (NYS Thruway), to its end northwest of Baldwinsville in Lysander at [[NY 48]] and [[NY 631]].
* [[File:NY-695.svg|25px]] [[New York State Route 695]] is a short state highway west of Syracuse in the village of [[Solvay, New York|Solvay]] in [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]]. The number of the highway was derived from the two highways that NY 695 links, Interstate 690 and NY 5.

'''[[New York State Highways|New York State Routes]]'''
* [[File:NY-5.svg|22px]] [[New York State Route 5]] runs east–west through Syracuse, including downtown, and follows Erie Boulevard and West Genesee Street.
* [[File:NY-80.svg|22px]] [[New York State Route 80]]'s western terminus is at NY 175 on the south side. The route follows Valley Drive.
* [[File:NY-92.svg|22px]] [[New York State Route 92]]'s western terminus is in downtown Syracuse at US 11. The route follows East Genesee Street.

=== Utilities ===
The Syracuse water system was one of the few water systems built and operated before federal funding. The water system was constructed mainly to support the industries around Syracuse, New York. Construction of Syracuse's water system began in 1868.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ocwa.org/about/the-early-years/#o378|title=The Early Years {{!}} OCWA|website=www.ocwa.org|access-date=October 13, 2016|archive-date=October 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012200647/http://www.ocwa.org/about/the-early-years/#o378|url-status=live}}</ref> The water is brought in on a [[Gravity feed|gravity fed system]] from [[Skaneateles Lake]], through an unfiltered system, and carried into the city. It is noted for having some of the best drinking water in the nation,<ref>{{Cite web|title=City of Syracuse|url=http://www.syracuse.ny.us/water_faqs.aspx|access-date=September 29, 2021|website=syracuse.ny.us|archive-date=December 3, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203124357/http://www.syracuse.ny.us/Water_FAQs.aspx|url-status=live}}</ref> due to the quality of the lake.

In 2015, the city experienced an average of at least one [[Water supply network|water main]] break per day. Between 2005 and 2015, the city suffered 2,000 water main breaks. Mayor Stephanie Miner estimated of the cost to fix the city's water infrastructure at $1&nbsp;billion over a 10–15-year period.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://tinewsdaily.com/stories/510503886-mayor-syracuse-n-y-water-infrastructure-system-in-crisis|title = Mayor: Syracuse, N.Y., water infrastructure system in crisis|date = March 23, 2015|work = TI News Daily|access-date = April 17, 2015|archive-date = April 17, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150417064123/http://tinewsdaily.com/stories/510503886-mayor-syracuse-n-y-water-infrastructure-system-in-crisis|url-status = live}}</ref> On February 25, 2015, Miner testified before a joint hearing of the state Assembly Ways and Means Committee and state Senate Finance Committee.

=== Fire department ===
[[File:SFD Maltese Patch.png|thumb|158x158px|Patch of the Syracuse Fire Department]]
The Syracuse Fire Department (SFD) has the responsibility of protecting the City of Syracuse from fires and other dangers. The department provides multiple services in addition to fire related calls: multi-county regional HAZ-MAT response, first response to medical and trauma calls, unmanned aerial vehicle (drone) capabilities, and teams experienced in high-angle rope, swift water, and confined space rescue operations. The Chief of Fire is Michael J. Monds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.syracuse.ny.us/fire_department.aspx|title=City of Syracuse|website=syracuse.ny.us|access-date=November 26, 2021|archive-date=June 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210620021846/http://www.syracuse.ny.us/Fire_Department.aspx|url-status=live}}</ref> SFD headquarters is in the John C. Dillon Public Safety Building at 511 South State Street.<ref name="auto" /> The department has a Class 1 rating from the [[Insurance Services Office]], which is the best rating obtainable. This rating has a direct effect on the fire insurance of properties within the city. The SFD operates out of 11 fire stations, organized into three districts (akin to battalions), located throughout the city. The SFD currently maintains nine engine companies (operating with nine corresponding "mini" units), five truck companies, one heavy rescue company, a manpower-squad company, and several special and support units. The department also provides Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting [[ARFF]] coverage and specialized fire, rescue, medical, and hazardous materials coverage to the [[Syracuse Hancock International Airport]] (station 4).
