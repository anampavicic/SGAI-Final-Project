'''Fianarantsoa''' is a city (commune urbaine) in south central [[Madagascar]], and is the capital of [[Haute Matsiatra]] Region.

==History==
It was built in the early 19th century by the [[Merina]] as the administrative capital for the newly conquered [[Betsileo]] kingdoms.

Fianarantsoa means "Good education" in [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]]. It is a cultural and intellectual center for the whole island.  It is home to some of the oldest [[Protestant]] and [[Lutheran]] cathedrals on the island, the oldest theological seminary (also Lutheran), as well as the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Archdiocese of Fianarantsoa]] (seated in the [[Holy Name of Jesus Cathedral, Fianarantsoa|Cathedral of the Holy Name of Jesus]]). The city of "good education" also boasts a university named after it and built in 1972. Fianarantsoa is considered to be the capital of wine in [[Madagascar]], because of the presence of many wine industries in the city.

==Geography==
It is at an average altitude of {{convert|1200|m}}, and has a population of 191,766.

The town is linked to the rest of the country by the [[Route nationale 7 (Madagascar)|National road 7]], one of the main highways in Madagascar. The distance is 411&nbsp;km to the capital [[Antananarivo]], 192&nbsp;km to [[Ihosy]],  518&nbsp;km to [[Tulear]].

[[Ranomafana National Park]] is a nature park popular among tourists that lies 65&nbsp;km to the northeast of Fianarantsoa.
Another hot spot of tourism is the [[Isandra]] geolocical formations, roughly 30&nbsp;km Northwest of Fianarantsoa. It can be accessed by the [[Route nationale 42 (Madagascar)|unpaved National road 42]] from Fianarantsoa.

==Rivers==
Two rivers cross this town: the [[Mandranofotsy]] in the West, and the [[Tsiandanitra]] in the East. Both are affluents of the [[Matsiatra]] river.

==Transport==
The city is at the endpoint of the [[Fianarantsoa-Côte Est Railway]] to [[Manakara]]. There is also an [[Fianarantsoa Airport|airport]]. The city lies on the Route Nationale 7, which goes from the capital in Antananarivo to the coastal city of Toliara.
Also the [[Route nationale 42 (Madagascar)|unpaved National road 42]] takes its origins in Fianarantsoa.

== Sights ==
In the Upper Town (''Haute Ville''), Fianarantsoa's historical centre, where many brick houses were renovated in the original style, various churches on ''Rue du Rova'' street are worth a visit. The oldest church in Fianarantsoa is Eglise Antranobiriky dating from 1859.<ref>Holger Hooge: ''Madagascar'', p. 76. Ostfildern 2023</ref> Fahazavana Church was built at the end of the 19th century in a [[Romanesque Revival architecture|neoromanesque]] style.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.colonialarchitectureproject.org/picture?/102395/tags/1-church | title=Fianarantsoa, Ambalavao Fahazavana Church &#124; Colonial Architecture Project }}</ref> Fiangonana Trinité Masombahoaka is a Protestant [[Gothic Revival architecture|neogothic]] church dating from 1885. The largest church, the cathedral ''Cathédrale du Saint-Nom-de-Jésus de Fianarantsoa'', was built from 1871 to 1890.

The train station in the busy district Lower Town (''Basse Ville'') was inaugurated in 1935.<ref>Holger Hooge: ''Madagascar'', p. 75. Ostfildern 2023</ref> In front of the train station, in the middle of ''Place de la gare'' square, a memorial dedicated to the victims of the [[Malagasy Uprising]] of 1947 was erected.
