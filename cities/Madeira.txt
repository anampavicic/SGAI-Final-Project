{{Main|History of Madeira}}

===Ancient===
[[Plutarch]] in his ''[[Parallel Lives]]'' (''Sertorius'', 75 AD) referring to the military commander [[Quintus Sertorius]] (d. 72 BC), relates that after his return to [[Cádiz]], he met sailors who spoke of idyllic Atlantic islands: "The islands are said to be two in number separated by a very narrow strait and lie {{convert|10,000|furlong|km|lk=in|sigfig=2|disp=sqbr}} from Africa. They are called the [[Fortunate Isles|Isles of the Blessed]]."<ref>{{Citation |last=[[Plutarch]] |title=The Parallel Lives: Sertorius, ch. 8 |url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/sertorius*.html |access-date=19 February 2021 |archive-date=16 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230516005749/https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Sertorius%2A.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Accounts by [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] state that the Mugharrarin ("the adventurers" – seafarers from Lisbon) came across an island where they found "a huge quantity of sheep, the meat of which was bitter and inedible" before going to the more inhabited [[Canary Islands]]. This island, possibly Madeira or [[Hierro]], must have been inhabited or previously visited by people for livestock to be present.<ref>Idrisi, La première géographie de l'Occident, NEF, Paris 1999</ref>

===Legend===
During the reign of King [[Edward III of England]], lovers [[Robert Machin|Robert Machim]] and Anna d'Arfet were said to have fled from England to France in 1346. Driven off course by a violent storm, their ship ran aground along the coast of an island that may have been Madeira. Later this legend was the basis of the naming of the city of [[Machico]] on the island, in memory of the young lovers.<ref>Nicholas Cayetano de Bettencourt Pitta, 1812, pp. 11–17</ref>

[[File:Funchal ( Portugal )13.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[João Gonçalves Zarco]]]]
In 1418, two captains, [[João Gonçalves Zarco]] and [[Tristão Vaz Teixeira]], while exploring the African coast in the service of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], were driven off course by a storm to an island which they named {{lang | pt | [[Porto Santo Island|Porto Santo]]}} (English: "holy harbour") in gratitude for divine deliverance from a shipwreck.

The following year, Zarco and Vaz organised an expedition with [[Bartolomeu Perestrello]]. The trio travelled to the island of Porto Santo, claimed it on behalf of the Portuguese Crown, and established a settlement. The new settlers observed "a heavy black cloud suspended to the southwest" and upon investigation discovered the larger island they called {{lang | pt | Madeira}}<ref>The discoveries of Porto Santo and Madeira were first described by [[Gomes Eanes de Zurara]] in ''Chronica da Descoberta e Conquista da Guiné''. (Eng. version by Edgar Prestage in 2 vols. issued by the [[Hakluyt Society]], London, 1896–1899: ''The Chronicle of Discovery and Conquest of Guinea''.) French author [[Arkan Simaan]] refers to these discoveries in his historical novel based on Azurara's Chronicle: ''L'Écuyer d'Henri le Navigateur'' (2007), published by Éditions l'Harmattan, Paris.</ref><ref>Nicholas Cayetano de Bettencourt Pitta, 1812, p.20</ref> ({{langx |pt|madeira | translation = wood}}).

===Settlement===

The first Portuguese settlers began colonizing the islands around 1420 or 1425.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dervenn |first1=Claude |translator-last=Hogarth-Gaute |translator-first=Frances |year=1957 |title=Madeira |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ph60AAAAIAAJ |location=London, UK |publisher=[[George G.

The majority of settlers were fishermen and peasant farmers who willingly left Portugal for a new life on the islands, a better one, they hoped, than was possible in a Portugal which had been ravaged by the [[Black Death]], and where the best farmlands were strictly controlled by the nobility.

To have minimum conditions for the development of agriculture on the island, the settlers had to chop down part of the dense forest and build a large number of water channels, called “levadas”, to carry the abundant waters on the north coast to the south coast of the island. {{cn|date=February 2023}}

Grain production began to fall and the ensuing crisis forced [[Henry the Navigator]] to order other commercial crops to be planted so that the islands could be profitable.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} These specialised plants, and their associated industrial technology, created one of the major revolutions on the islands and fuelled Portuguese industry.

Sugarcane production was the primary engine of the island's economy, which quickly afforded the Funchal metropolis economic prosperity. The production of sugar cane attracted adventurers and merchants from all parts of Europe, especially [[Italians]], [[Basques]], [[Catalans]], and [[Flemish people|Flemish]]. This meant that, in the second half of the fifteenth century, the city of Funchal became a mandatory port of call for European trade routes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The 'White Gold' Era |url=http://www.visitmadeira.pt/en-gb/madeira/history/era-of-white-gold |access-date=2 October 2021 |website=www.visitmadeira.pt |archive-date=3 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211003001357/http://www.visitmadeira.pt/en-gb/madeira/history/era-of-white-gold |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=davide |title=Madeira Ruled the Sugar Trade |url=https://www.portuguesemuseum.org/?page_id=1808&category=3&exhibit=&event=184 |access-date=11 November 2021 |language=en-US |archive-date=11 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211111232354/https://portuguesemuseum.org/?page_id=1808&category=3&exhibit=&event=184 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Slaves were used during the island's period of sugar trade to cultivate sugar cane alongside paid workers, though slave owners were only a small minority of the Madeiran population, and those who did own slaves owned only a few. Slaves consisted of [[Guanches]] from the nearby Canary islands, captured Berbers from the [[conquest of Ceuta]] and West Africans after further exploration of the African coast.<ref>Godinho, V. M.

Until the first half of the sixteenth century, Madeira was one of the major sugar markets of the Atlantic. Apparently, it is in Madeira that, in the context of sugar production, slave labour was applied for the first time. The colonial system of sugar production was put into practice on the island of Madeira, on a much smaller scale, and later transferred, on a large scale, to other overseas production areas.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Systems |first=Wow |title=Sugar Cane and Madeira Island |url=https://blog.madeira.best/sugar-cane-and-madeira-island |access-date=11 November 2021 |website=Madeira Sugar Cane History |language=en |archive-date=3 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211003012205/https://blog.madeira.best/sugar-cane-and-madeira-island |url-status=live }}</ref>

Later on, this small scale of production was outmatched by [[Colonial Brazil|Brazilian]] and [[Portuguese São Tomé and Príncipe|São Tomean]] plantations. Madeiran sugar production declined in such a way that it was not enough for domestic needs, so that sugar was imported to the island from other Portuguese colonies.{{cn|date=May 2022}} Sugar mills were gradually abandoned, with few remaining, which gave way to other markets in Madeira. 

In the 17th century, as Portuguese sugar production was shifted to Brazil, São Tomé and Príncipe and elsewhere, Madeira's most important commodity product became its wine.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Systems |first=Wow |title=Sugar Cane and Madeira Island |url=https://blog.madeira.best/sugar-cane-and-madeira-island |access-date=3 October 2021 |website=Madeira Sugar Cane History |language=en |archive-date=3 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211003012205/https://blog.madeira.best/sugar-cane-and-madeira-island |url-status=live }}</ref> Sugar plantations were replaced by vineyards, originating in the so-called ‘Wine Culture’, which acquired international fame and provided the rise of a new social class, the [[Bourgeoisie]].

With the increase of commercial treaties with England, important English merchants settled on the Island and, ultimately, controlled the increasingly important island wine trade. The English traders settled in the Funchal as of the seventeenth century, consolidating the markets from North America, the [[West Indies]] and England itself. The [[Madeira wine]] became very popular in the markets and it is also said to have been used in a toast during the [[American Revolution|Declaration of Independence]] by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Wine Cicle |url=http://www.visitmadeira.pt/en-gb/madeira/history/wine-culture |access-date=3 October 2021 |website=www.visitmadeira.pt |archive-date=3 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211003001405/http://www.visitmadeira.pt/en-gb/madeira/history/wine-culture |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=USA celebrated independence with Madeira Wine |url=http://www.visitmadeira.pt/en-gb/madeira/did-you-know-that/usa-celebrated-independence-with-madeira-wine |access-date=3 October 2021 |website=www.visitmadeira.pt |archive-date=3 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211003002610/http://www.visitmadeira.pt/en-gb/madeira/did-you-know-that/usa-celebrated-independence-with-madeira-wine |url-status=live }}</ref>[[File:Sé do Funchal.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of Funchal]] with its tower of 15th-century [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] in the background]] In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Madeira stands out for its climate and therapeutic effects.{{cn|date=May 2022}} In the nineteenth century, visitors to the island integrated four major groups: patients, travellers, tourists and scientists.

Sea cliffs, such as [[Cabo Girão]], valleys and ravines extend from this central spine, leaving the interior generally inaccessible.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.madeirahelp.com/madeira_geography |title=MadeiraHelp.com |publisher=MadeiraHelp.com |date=22 February 1999 |access-date=30 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731015932/http://www.madeirahelp.com/madeira_geography |archive-date=31 July 2010 }}</ref> Daily life is concentrated in the many villages at the mouths of the ravines, through which the heavy autumn and winter rains travel to the sea.<ref>Robert White, 1851, p. 4</ref>

===Climate===
Madeira has many different bioclimates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalbioclimatics.org/form/tb_med.htm |title=Mapas bioclimáticos y biogeográficos |website=Globalbioclimatics.org |access-date=2 August 2017 |archive-date=14 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014103938/http://www.globalbioclimatics.org/form/tb_med.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Based on differences in sun exposure, humidity, and annual mean temperature, clear variations distinguish north- and south-facing regions, as well as some islands. The islands are strongly influenced by the [[Gulf Stream]] and [[Canary Current]], giving it mild to warm year-round temperatures. According to the Instituto de Meteorologia (IPMA), the average annual temperature at Funchal weather station is {{convert|19.6|C|F|1}} for the 1981–2010 period. [[Orographic lift|Relief]] is a determinant factor on precipitation levels; areas such as the [[Madeira Natural Park]] can get as much as {{cvt|2800|mm}} of precipitation a year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipma.pt/pt/oclima/normais.clima/1971-2000/#535 |title=Precipitation of Madeira Island |publisher=[[IPMA]] |access-date=8 October 2020 |archive-date=26 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926152417/http://www.ipma.pt/pt/oclima/normais.clima/1971-2000/#535 |url-status=live }}</ref> Madeira hosts lush [[laurel forests]], while [[Porto Santo]], a much flatter island, has a [[semiarid climate]] (''BSh''). In most winters snowfall occurs in the mountains.

==Flora and fauna==
{{see also|Madeira evergreen forests|Laurisilva of Madeira}}

===Endemic plant and animal species===

In the south, little is left of the indigenous subtropical rainforest that once covered the island{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} (the original settlers set fires to clear the land for farming) and named it (''madeira'' means "wood" in Portuguese). However, in the north, the valleys harbor native trees. These ''[[Laurel forest|laurissilva]]'' [[Laurel forest|forests]], notably those on the northern slopes, are designated as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]. Madeira's paleobotanical record reveals that ''laurissilva'' forest has existed for at least 1.8&nbsp;million years.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Góis-Marques |first1=Carlos A. |last2=Madeira |first2=José |last3=Menezes de Sequeira |first3=Miguel |title=Inventory and review of the Mio–Pleistocene São Jorge flora (Madeira Island, Portugal): palaeoecological and biogeographical implications |journal=Journal of Systematic Palaeontology |volume=16 |issue=2 |date=7 February 2017 |pages=159–177 |doi=10.1080/14772019.2017.1282991 |hdl=10400.13/4191 |s2cid=132935444 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> Critically endangered species such as the vine ''[[Jasminum azoricum]]''<ref name="IUCN">{{cite iucn |author=Fernandes, F. |date=2011 |title=''Jasminum azoricum'' |volume=2011 |page=e.T162250A5564173 |doi=10.2305/IUCN.UK.2011-1.RLTS.T162250A5564173.en |access-date=12 November 2021 }}</ref> and the rowan ''[[Sorbus maderensis]]'' are endemic.

=== Madeiran wolf spider ===
''[[Hogna ingens]]'', the Deserta Grande wolf spider, is endemic to the Madeira archipelago, specifically [[Deserta Grande Island]]. It is critically endangered.

Three species of birds are endemic to Madeira: the [[Trocaz pigeon]], the [[Madeira Chaffinch]] and the [[Madeira firecrest]].

===Mice===
Madeira is home to six species of brown mice, believed to be descendants of common European brown mice brought to the island by [[Vikings]] in the 9th century (or conceivably by 15th century Portuguese settlers), but diversified to the point where they cannot interbreed with their ancestral species or with one another. They have essentially the same genes, but rearranged to give different chromosome numbers: the ancestral species has 40 chromosomes, whereas the Madeira species have from 22 to 30.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/hdy.2012.107 |title=Origin of the chromosomal radiation of Madeiran house mice: a microsatellite analysis of metacentric chromosomes |last1=Förster |first1=D.

==Politics==
{{Main page|Politics of Madeira}}
=== Political autonomy ===
Due to its distinct geography, economy, social and cultural situation, as well as the historical autonomic aspirations of the population, the Autonomous Regions of Madeira was established in 1976.<ref name="ConstP">{{citation |title=Constituição da República Portuguesa |url=https://www.parlamento.pt/Legislacao/Documents/constpt2005.pdf |year=2005 |contribution=Art.255 |edition=VII Revisão Constituicional |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=pt |access-date=5 August 2005 |archive-date=21 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521072711/http://www.parlamento.pt/Legislacao/Documents/constpt2005.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> Although it is a politico-administrative autonomous region, the Portuguese constitution specifies both a regional and national connection, obliging their administrations to maintain democratic principles and promote regional interests, while reinforcing national unity.

As defined by the [[Constitution of Portugal|Portuguese constitution]] and other laws, Madeira possesses its own political and administrative [[statute]] and has its own [[government]]. The branches of Government are the [[Regional Government of Madeira|Regional Government]] and the [[Legislative Assembly of Madeira|Legislative Assembly]], the latter elected by [[universal suffrage]], using the [[D'Hondt method]] of [[proportional representation]].

The president of the Regional Government is appointed by the Representative of the Republic according to the results of the election to the legislative assemblies.

The [[sovereignty]] of the Portuguese Republic is represented in Madeira by the Representative of the Republic, appointed by the [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]] on the advice of the [[Government of Portugal|Government of the Republic]]. The tasks of the Representative of the Republic are to sign and order the publication of regional legislative decrees and regional regulatory decrees or to exercise the right of veto over regional laws, should these laws be unconstitutional. Before the sixth amendment to the [[Constitution of Portugal|Portuguese Constitution]] passed in 2006, this responsibility was held by a more-powerful Minister of the Republic, who was proposed by the Government and appointed by the President.{{cn|date=July 2022}}

=== Status within the European Union ===
[[File:EU OCT and OMR map en.png|thumb|270px|Map of the pre-[[Brexit]] European Union in the world, with [[Special member state territories and the European Union|overseas countries and territories (OCT) and outermost regions (OMR)]] for which Madeira is included]]Madeira is an [[Outermost region|Outermost Region]] (OMR) of the [[European Union]], meaning that due to its geographical situation, it is entitled to [[derogation]] from some EU policies.

According to the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], both primary and secondary [[European Union law]] applies to Madeira, with possible derogations to take account of its "structural social and economic situation&nbsp;(...) which is compounded by their remoteness, insularity, small size, difficult topography and climate, economic dependence on a few products, the permanence and combination of which severely restrain their development".<ref name="Article 349 of TFEU">[http://wikisophia.org/index.php?title=Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_the_Functioning_of_the_European_Union/Part_Seven:_General_and_Final_Provisions Article 349]{{dead link|date=April 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]].</ref> An example of such derogation is seen in the approval of the [[International Business Centre of Madeira]] and other state aid policies to help the rum industry.

It forms part of the [[European Union Customs Union|European Union customs area]], the [[Schengen Area]] and the [[European Union Value Added Tax Area]].

=== Foreign relations and defence ===

Foreign affairs and defence are the responsibility of the national government. The Madeira Military Zone is the [[Portuguese Army]]'s command for ground forces stationed in the islands, centering on the 3rd Garrison Regiment based at Funchal.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.exercito.pt/pt/quem-somos/organizacao/ceme/cft/zmm |title=Quartel-General da Zona Militar da Madeira |website=Portuguese Army |access-date=24 July 2023 |archive-date=24 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230724122607/https://www.exercito.pt/pt/quem-somos/organizacao/ceme/cft/zmm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.exercito.pt/pt/quem-somos/organizacao/ceme/cft/zmm/rg3 |title=Regimento de Guarnição N.º 3 |website=Portuguese Army |access-date=24 July 2023 |archive-date=24 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230724213913/https://www.exercito.pt/pt/quem-somos/organizacao/ceme/cft/zmm/rg3 |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Portuguese Navy|Navy]] tasks the patrol vessels [[Flyvefisken-class patrol vessel|''Tejo'' and ''Mondego'']] specifically to Madeira, as well as other vessels as required, in order to patrol [[Exclusive economic zone of Portugal|Portugal's large economic zone]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.marinha.pt/pt/os_meios/patrulhas/Paginas/NRP-TEJO.aspx |title=NRP TEJO |website=Portuguese Navy |access-date=24 July 2023 |archive-date=26 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230126223642/https://www.marinha.pt/pt/os_meios/patrulhas/Paginas/NRP-TEJO.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.marinha.pt/pt/os_meios/patrulhas/Paginas/NRP-MONDEGO.aspx |title=NRP MONDEGO |website=Portuguese Navy |access-date=24 July 2023 |archive-date=20 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230920120135/https://www.marinha.pt/pt/os_meios/patrulhas/Paginas/NRP-MONDEGO.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.marinha.pt/pt/os_meios/lanchas/Paginas/default.aspx |title=Lanchas |website=Portuguese Navy |access-date=24 July 2023 |archive-date=24 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230724212607/https://www.marinha.pt/pt/os_meios/lanchas/Paginas/default.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.marinha.pt/pt/os_meios/patrulhasoceanicos/Paginas/nrp-figueira-foz.aspx |title=NRP Figueira da Foz |website=Portuguese Navy |access-date=24 July 2023 |archive-date=31 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230531033816/https://www.marinha.pt/pt/os_meios/patrulhasoceanicos/Paginas/nrp-figueira-foz.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref> To support search and rescue, the [[Portuguese Air Force]] maintains [[Porto Santo Airport#Military air base|a staging base]] on [[Porto Santo Island]] incorporating detachments of [[EADS CASA C-295|C-295]] aircraft and [[AgustaWestland AW101|Merlin]] helicopters.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.emfa.pt/unidade-60-aerodromo-de-manobra-n-3 |title=AERÓDROMO DE MANOBRA N.º 3 |website=Portuguese Air Force |access-date=25 July 2023 |archive-date=23 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230723155927/https://www.emfa.pt/unidade-60-aerodromo-de-manobra-n-3 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The city of [[New Bedford]] is especially rich in Madeirans, hosting the Museum of Madeira Heritage. The annual Madeiran and Luso-American celebration, the [[Feast of the Blessed Sacrament]], the world's largest celebration of Madeiran heritage, regularly draws crowds of tens of thousands to the city's Madeira Field.

1849 saw an emigration of Protestant religious exiles from Madeira to the United States, by way of Trinidad and elsewhere in the [[West Indies]]. Most of them settled in [[Illinois]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/portam/exiles.html |title=Protestant Exiles from Madeira in Illinois |work=loc.gov |access-date=30 December 2017 |archive-date=9 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109082430/http://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/portam/exiles.html |url-status=live }}</ref> with financial and physical aid of the American Protestant Society, headquartered in New York City. In the late 1830s physician and Presbyterian minister Reverend [[Robert Reid Kalley]], from Scotland made a stop at Funchal, Madeira on his way to a mission in China, with his wife, so that she could recover from an illness.

Another Scottish missionary, William Hepburn Hewitson, took on Protestant ministerial activities in Madeira.

The tropical climate was unfamiliar and they found themselves in serious economic difficulties. By 1848, the American Protestant Society raised money and sent Rev. Manuel J. Gonsalves, a Baptist minister and a naturalized U.S. citizen from Madeira, to work with Rev. Arsénio da Silva, who had emigrated with the exiles from Madeira, to arrange to resettle those who wanted to come to the United States. Rev. da Silva died in early 1849. Later in 1849, Rev. Gonsalves was then charged with escorting the exiles from Trinidad to settle in Sangamon and Morgan counties in Illinois on land purchased with funds raised by the American Protestant Society.

===Immigration===
Madeira is part of the [[Schengen Area]].

Due to its growing popularity, Madeira’s population has grown, reaching 253,259 in 2022, of whom the majority are locals. But Madeira has, for many years, witnessed a rising foreign population. As of 31 December 2022, immigrants in the region totaled 11,793 people, representing an increase of 13.3% compared to 2021. “Nationals from Venezuela (19.7%), the United Kingdom (11.8%), Germany (9.4%) and Brazil (9.2%) continue to represent the main foreign communities in the region<ref>{{Cite web |title=27-10-2023 - DREM releases the publication "Demographic Statistics of the Autonomous Region of Madeira 2022" and updated the time series |url=https://estatistica.madeira.gov.pt/en/download-now-3/social-gb/popcondsoc-gb/demografia-gb/demografia-noticias-gb/4203-27-10-2023-drem-releases-the-publication-demographic-statistics-of-the-autonomous-region-of-madeira-2022-and-updated-the-time-series.html |access-date=2024-03-19 |website=estatistica.madeira.gov.pt |archive-date=19 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240319150029/https://estatistica.madeira.gov.pt/en/download-now-3/social-gb/popcondsoc-gb/demografia-gb/demografia-noticias-gb/4203-27-10-2023-drem-releases-the-publication-demographic-statistics-of-the-autonomous-region-of-madeira-2022-and-updated-the-time-series.html |url-status=live }}</ref>”, according to the DREM (Madeira Statistics Department). <ref>{{Cite web |last=Pearls |first=of Portugal |date=12 February 2024 |title=Madeira: Get to know Portugal's Atlantic Pearl |url=https://www.pearlsofportugal.com/living-in-portugal/madeira-island-portugal-atlantic-pearl/ |access-date=19 March 2024 |website=The best of Portugal on one site |language=en-US |archive-date=19 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240319150028/https://www.pearlsofportugal.com/living-in-portugal/madeira-island-portugal-atlantic-pearl/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{Main|International Business Centre of Madeira|l1=International Business Center of Madeira}}

The [[International Business Centre of Madeira|Madeira International Business Center]] (MIBC) [[free trade zone]] has led to additional infrastructure, production shops and essential services for small and medium-sized industrial enterprises. MIBC comprises three sectors of investment: the Industrial Free Trade Zone, the International Shipping Register – MAR and International Services. Madeira's tax regime has been approved by the European Commission as legal State Aid and its deadline was extended through 2027. MIBC was created formally in the 1980s as a tool of regional economic policy.{{cn|date=February 2022}} It consists of (mainly tax) incentives, granted with the objective of attracting investment into Madeira.  

Favorable operational and fiscal conditions were approved by the European Commission under Article 299 of the [[Treaty on European Union]]. The MIBC is integrated in the Portuguese and EU legal systems and is regulated and supervised by Portuguese and EU authorities in a transparent and stable business environment, clearly distinguished from so-called "tax havens" and "offshore jurisdictions". In 2015, the EC authorized a state aid regime for companies incorporated between 2015 and 2020 and extended the regime of tax reductions through 2027. The tax regime is outlined in Article 36°-A of the Portuguese Tax Incentives Statute. Available data demonstrates that this programme aided the local labor market, through the creation of qualified jobs and for professionals who have returned to Madeira; increased productivity; expanded business tourism from the visits of investors and their clients and suppliers, and other sectors such as real estate. Telecommunications and other services benefit from a larger client base. Companies attracted by MIBC represent over 40% of revenue in terms of corporate income tax for the Government of Madeira and nearly 3.000 jobs. Salaries there are above average in comparison with the wages paid in other sectors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibc-madeira.com/about_ibc.aspx?ID=51 |title=International Business Centre of Madeira – About IBC |work=ibc-madeira.com |access-date=16 January 2014 |archive-date=17 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117073225/http://www.ibc-madeira.com/about_ibc.aspx?ID=51 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Regional government ===
Madeira has been a significant recipient of [[European Union]] funding, totaling €2&nbsp;billion. In 2012, it was reported that despite a population of just 250,000, the local administration owed some €6&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/portugal/9191749/Billions-of-euros-of-EU-money-yet-Madeira-has-built-up-massive-debts.html |title=Billions of euros of EU money yet Madeira has built up massive debts |access-date=10 July 2016 |date=7 April 2012 |last1=Freeman |first1=Colin |archive-date=10 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810080943/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/portugal/9191749/Billions-of-euros-of-EU-money-yet-Madeira-has-built-up-massive-debts.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The Portuguese treasury (IGCP) assumed Madeira's debt management between 2012 and 2015. The region works with the central government on a long-term plan to reduce debt levels and commercial debt stock. [[Moody's]] noted that the region made significant fiscal consolidation efforts and that its tax revenue collection has improved. Tax revenues increased by 41% between 2012 and 2016, helping the region to reduce its deficit to operating revenue ratio to 10% in 2016 from 77% in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-changes-outlook-to-positive-on-the-ratings-of-Azores--PR_371628 |title=Moody's changes outlook to positive on the ratings of Azores and Madeira; ratings affirmed |date=5 September 2017 |publisher=Moody's |access-date=19 March 2018 |archive-date=19 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319085134/https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-changes-outlook-to-positive-on-the-ratings-of-Azores--PR_371628 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the first half of 2022, 33% of the electricity consumed on the Portuguese archipelago of Madeira was sourced from renewable energy, a milestone achieved through a collaborative initiative co-funded by the European Union (EU).<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |date=3 July 2023 |title=How did Madeira become the EU's poster child for renewable energy? |url=https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2023/07/03/how-did-madeira-become-the-eus-poster-child-for-renewable-energy |access-date=29 September 2023 |website=euronews |language=en |archive-date=29 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231029085456/https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2023/07/03/how-did-madeira-become-the-eus-poster-child-for-renewable-energy |url-status=live }}</ref>

Central to this accomplishment are the centuries-old stone pipes known as levadas, spanning thousands of kilometers and dating back to the fifteenth century. These levadas efficiently transport rainwater from northern regions to the south, serving various purposes such as human consumption, agriculture, and electricity production.<ref name=":1" />

The Socorridos hydroelectric power station, fueled by water conveyed through the levadas, stands as the island's principal hydraulic system, providing power consistently throughout the year. A significant aspect of the EU-funded multi-million euro project involved enhancing water storage capacity, including the construction of a 5.4-kilometer tunnel and additional mountain tunnels, presenting formidable engineering challenges.<ref name=":1" />

Wind power complements the system, facilitating the movement of stored water uphill during peak demand periods. The treated water serves dual purposes—human consumption and agriculture—while also functioning as a renewable energy source. Nuno Jorge Pereira, Water Production Director for Wood, Water, and Waste (ARM), elucidates the strategic use of water volumes to adapt to energy production levels.<ref name=":1" />

This €34.7 million project, with €17.3 million co-financed by the European Cohesion Policy, not only mitigates concerns about drought but also earned acclaim as one of the best EU co-funded projects in the EGIOSTAR Awards.<ref name=":1" />

The optimized Socorridos plant has notably alleviated water-related challenges for local farmers.<ref name=":1" />

{{Main|Music of Madeira}}
[[File:Madeirenses.jpg|thumb|Bailinho da Madeira]]
[[Folklore]] music in Madeira is widespread and mainly uses local musical instruments such as the [[Machete (musical instrument)|machete]], [[rajão]], [[brinquinho]] and [[cavaquinho]], which are used in traditional folkloric dances like the {{lang|pt|bailinho da Madeira}}.

Emigrants from Madeira also influenced the creation of new musical instruments. In the 1880s, the [[ukulele]] was created, based on two small guitar-like instruments of Madeiran origin, the [[cavaquinho]] and the [[rajão]]. The ukulele was introduced to the [[Hawaiian Islands]] by [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] immigrants from Madeira and Cape Verde.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nidel |first=Richard |title=World Music: The Basics |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |page=[https://archive.org/details/worldmusic00rich_0/page/312 312] |isbn=978-0-415-96800-3 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/worldmusic00rich_0/page/312 }}</ref> Three immigrants in particular, Madeiran cabinet makers Manuel Nunes, José do Espírito Santo, and Augusto Dias, are generally credited as the first ukulele makers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=Helen |title=Ancient Hawaiian Music |publisher=[[Bernice P.

These are so integral a part of traditional eating habits that a special iron stand is available with a T-shaped end, each branch of the "T" having a slot in the middle to hold a [[brochette]] (espeto in Portuguese); a small plate is then placed underneath to collect the juices. The brochettes are very long and have a V-shaped blade in order to pierce the meat more easily. It is usually accompanied with the local bread called [[bolo do caco]]. A traditional holiday dish is "Carne de Vinho e Alhos", which is most closely associated with the pig slaughter that was held a few weeks before Christmas. A big event, traditionally it was attended by everyone in the village. The dish is made of pork which marinates for three days in white wine, vinegar, salt, and pepper and is then cooked with small potatoes, sliced carrots, and turnip. Another common meat dish is “Picado" - cubed beef cooked in a mushroom sauce and accompanied by fries.<ref name="goas"/>

[[Madeira wine]] is a [[fortified wine]] produced in the Madeira Islands; varieties may be sweet or dry. It has a history dating back to the [[Age of Exploration]] when Madeira was a standard [[Port#Port of call|port of call]] for ships heading to the [[New World]] or [[East Indies]]. To prevent the wine from spoiling, neutral [[grape spirit]]s were added. However, wine producers of Madeira discovered, when an unsold shipment of wine returned to the islands after a round trip, that the flavour of the wine had been transformed by exposure to heat and movement. Today, Madeira is noted for its unique winemaking process that involves heating the wine and deliberately exposing the wine to some levels of [[oxidation]].<ref name="Sotheby pg 340–341">T.
