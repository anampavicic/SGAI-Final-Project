'''Deventer''' ({{IPA|nl|ˈdeːvəntər|lang|Nl-Deventer.ogg}}; [[Sallaans dialect|Sallands]]: {{lang|sdz|Daeventer}}) is a [[List of cities in the Netherlands by province|city]] and [[Municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] in the [[Salland]] historical region of the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[Overijssel]], Netherlands. In 2020 the municipality of Deventer had a population of 100,913. The city is largely situated on the east bank of the river [[IJssel]], but it also has a small part of its territory on the west bank. In 2005 the municipality of [[Bathmen]] (with a population of about 5,000 people) was merged with Deventer as part of a national effort to reduce [[bureaucracy]] in the country.

Deventer is one of the oldest cities in the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite web|date=2015-10-16|title=Diverse overzichten van de stadsrechten in Nederland.|url=http://www.stadsrechten.nl/steden.htm|access-date=2021-10-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016000806/http://www.stadsrechten.nl/steden.htm|archive-date=2015-10-16}}</ref> The place is mentioned in 9th-century sources from the [[Diocese of Utrecht (695–1580)|Diocese of Utrecht]].

==History==
=== Foundation and development in the Middle Ages ===
Deventer was probably founded around 768 AD by the [[Kingdom of England|English]] [[missionary]] [[Lebuinus]], who built a wooden church on the east bank of the river [[IJssel]]. In January 772 AD the sack and burning of this church by a Saxon expedition was the cause for the first punitive war waged by Charlemagne to the Saxons, in which, in retribution, the [[Irminsul]] (the Saxon sacred tree, probably near modern [[Paderborn]]) was destroyed.  This was not the first human settlement at the location; between 1981 and 2006, remains of a late [[Roman Iron Age]] settlement (dated to c.300 AD) were excavated at Colmschate, 4&nbsp;km east of the current city.

[[File:Bergkerk Deventer vanuit Bergstraat.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|The towers of the [[St Nicholas Church, Deventer|St. Nicholas Church]], now deconsecrated, date back to circa 1200]]
The village of Deventer, already important because of a trading road crossing the river [[IJssel]], was looted and burnt down by the [[Vikings]] in 882. It was immediately rebuilt and fortified with an earthen wall (in the street ''Stenen Wal'' remains of this wall have been excavated and restored).

Deventer received [[City rights in the Low Countries|city rights]] in 956, after which fortifications were built or replaced by stone walls around the city for defense. Between 1000 and 1500, Deventer grew to be a flourishing trade city because of its harbour on the river IJssel, which was capable of accommodating large ships. The city eventually joined the [[Hanseatic League]].

One of the commodities it traded in, dried haddock and cod from Norway, gave the citizens the nickname they carry to this day: "Deventer [[Stockfish|Stokvis]]". In the 15th century, Deventer had a common mint, where coins for the three IJssel cities Deventer, [[Zwolle]], and [[Kampen (Overijssel)|Kampen]] were made.

Deventer is the birthplace of [[Geert Groote]] and home to his [[Brethren of the Common Life]], a school of religious thought that influenced [[Thomas a Kempis]] and [[Erasmus]] in later times. Together with Haarlem it was among the first cities to have printing presses, dating back to as early as 1477. From around 1300, it also housed a Latin School, which became internationally renowned, and remained in service in changing forms until 1971. Its most well-known student was the scholar [[Desiderius Erasmus]], who was born in 1466 and attended the school from 1475 to 1484.

=== 16th–18th centuries ===
[[File:Deventer 1550.jpg|thumb|Deventer in circa 1550]]
[[File:Blaeu 1652 - Deventer.jpg|thumb|1652 map of Deventer by [[Willem Blaeu|Willem]] and [[Joan Blaeu]]]]
[[File:Kungsboken-karta-deventer.jpg|thumb|Map of Deventer at the conquest 1672]]
Between 1500 and 1800, the volume of water flowing through the IJssel decreased, decreasing the importance of Deventer's harbour. The competition with trade centres in [[Holland]], as well as the [[Dutch War of Independence|religious war]] between 1568 and 1648, brought a decline in the city's economy.

In the 18th century, the [[iron]] industry came to Deventer. East of the town, so-called "oer", river sand containing iron, was found as early as 900. From this material, ore was produced and brought to town. The main road of the villages Okkenbroek, Lettele and Schalkhaar is still named Oerdijk (Ore Dyke).

=== Modern times ===
[[File:Deventer Binnen-vispoort.jpg|thumb|The former Binnen-Vispoort in the 19th century.]]
In the 19th century, Deventer became an industrial town. Bicycles (Burgers), carpets (Koninklijke Deventer Tapijtfabriek), tins and cans for food and drinks (Thomassen & Drijver), cigars (Horst & Maas en Bijdendijk & Ten Hove), foundry and heavy machinery (Nering Bögel), and textiles (Ankersmit)<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211205/vZ9UNQK_Jqs Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20190920215823/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ9UNQK_Jqs&gl=US&hl=en Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ9UNQK_Jqs| title = OPGEDOEKT, documentaire over Ankersmit Deventer | website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> were produced until the mid to late 20th century. Some of these industries are still thriving today, such as beds and accessories (Auping) and publishing ([[Wolters Kluwer]], now headquartered in [[Alphen aan den Rijn]]).

The city's trade and industry are still of some importance. The city is host to a factory producing [[central heating]] systems, as well as [[Wolters Kluwer]], a global information services and publishing company.

The Deventer honey cake (Bussink Deventer Koek), produced in Deventer for over 500 years, is still manufactured locally and sold all over the Netherlands and beyond.

==== World War II ====
[[File:Shooting of a scene from A bridge too far.jpg|thumb|left|Shooting a scene from ''[[A Bridge Too Far (1977 film)|A Bridge Too Far]]'' on location in Deventer, 1977]]
Deventer has seen few military engagements throughout its long history, although it was a [[garrison]] city of the Dutch [[cavalry]]. The IJssel bridge area and harbour were bombed heavily during [[World War II]]. The city centre has been largely spared, but many Allied bombs, meant to shell the IJssel railway bridge, came down on buildings in the city centre. The Deventer railway bridge was considered strategically important, being a part of the main railway connection between Amsterdam and the German city of Osnabrück, leading from there to either Berlin, Hamburg or Bremen. The railway bridge, constructed of steel, was difficult to hit. Many bombs were bounced down into the river or its banks, exploding in the areas around the bridge or failing to explode at all. The three heaviest of about 15 attacks were on October 28, 1944 causing 35 fatalities; on December 15, 1944 killing 33 people; and on February 6, 1945 causing the death of 61 people. In the aftermath of this last bombardment, the German occupying forces committed a [[war crime]]. The German army used a [[cool warehouse]] in Deventer for its military food supplies. In the city centre, the [[retirement home]] of the ''United Foundations'', originally dating back as far as the 13th century, caught fire by the shellings, as well as the army food warehouse. The Germans allowed local fire fighters only to extinguish the fire in the cool warehouse. The retirement home burnt down as good as totally. Over twenty of the elderly living there perished in the flames.<ref>Source: ''Klakkende laarzen aan de IJssel (...)''  by K.H. Vos, 1995, Arko Editors, ISBN 90-72047-26-5 (in Dutch), pp. 71-82, 93</ref>

The Jewish poet and writer [[Etty Hillesum]] lived in Deventer during the war before being deported to [[Auschwitz]].

In Schalkhaar, a village only 2&nbsp;km northeast of the city centre, barracks were used by the German occupying forces to train Nazi policemen. The compound is now a centre for [[asylum seekers]].

In a forested area between Lettele and Okkenbroek, about 10 kilometres east of Deventer, the Germans operated a [[V-1 flying bomb]] launching ramp. It was used from December, 1944, until March, 1945. Some of the 400 V-1 missiles launched there hit already liberated Belgium, including the city of Antwerp, killing many people. A war monument in the village of Lettele consists of concrete blocks from this launching site, that is a war monument itself as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tracesofwar.nl/sights/1484/V1-Feuerstellung-519-Lettele.htm|title = V1 Feuerstellung 519 Lettele - Lettele - TracesOfWar.nl}}</ref>

Deventer has been somewhat popular with the film industry. During the production of the 1977 film ''[[A Bridge Too Far (film)|A Bridge Too Far]]'', all of the scenes taking place in nearby [[Arnhem]] were filmed in Deventer - as Arnhem itself had lost its historic centre.

By the end of the 1950s, the buildings had reached the boundaries of the municipality. In 1960, for further expansion, the part of the municipality of Diepenveen was annexed that now covers the Keizerslanden, Borgele and Platvoet districts, all three realized in the 1960s; all together roughly the area up to (west of) the Zandwetering.

After a plan to expand the city across the IJssel, the so-called Double City Plan, was deemed unfeasible at the end of the 1960s, Deventer turned its attention to the east again: in 1974 part of Diepenveen was once again annexed. On January 1, 1999, the municipality of Diepenveen was dissolved and added to Deventer. The same happened with the municipality of Bathmen on 1 January 2005.

=== Water ===
[[File:Uiterwaarden nabij deventer TN.jpg|thumb|Floodplains near Deventer]]
The Deventer settlement was founded on a river dune on the [[IJssel]]. This river has played a major role for the city over the centuries, because of the trade that this waterway brought with it. In 1241 the city had received the Katentol on long lease from the Elten stift. This toll, which is named after the Katerveer under [[Zwolle]], had to be paid in the Deventer toll house near the Zandpoort, and generated a lot of money in the [[Middle Ages]].

The IJssel has also caused many problems over the centuries, because it often overflowed its banks. Nowadays Deventer has a flood defence, but the Welle ('wal', the name of the street over the quay) is still regularly under water during high water. Dike breaches of the IJssel have created many gullies in and around the city , such as the Douwelerkolk and the Klinkenbeltskolk.

In addition to the IJssel, Deventer has a large number of waters. The [[Schipbeek]] is a brook partly dug on behalf of the city that rises in [[Germany]] and flows into the IJssel near Deventer. In the past, the stream was navigable, so that wood and Bentheimer sandstone could be brought in, among other things. Another waterway that was built for shipping and which flows into the IJssel in Deventer is a branch of the Overijssels canal, through which Deventer was connected to a large system of canals through Overijssel. It was dug in the mid-19th century and opened in 1858.

===Sights===
[[File:Deventer, die Waage.jpg|thumb|De Waag]]
* The Grote Kerkhof square (Grand Churchyard).
* The Saint [[Lebuïnuskerk]] (St. Lebuin's Church) in [[Gothic style]], with ceiling paintings and an organ. Its tower can be climbed in summer.
* The City Hall with a façade built in 1693 in [[Dutch Baroque architecture|Dutch Baroque style]].
* The Brink (market square) with houses, shops, and cafes dating from 1575 to 1900. The market square is also the centre of Deventer nightlife. Alongside this square there is the Bussink "Koekhuisje", where the honey-cake Deventer Koek is sold. Markets take place every Friday (including one on Good Friday, following a medieval tradition) and Saturday.
* The Waag (Weighing-house) on the edge of the Brink square, built in 1550 and restored in 2003. The Deventer City Museum is housed inside the Waag. The Museum's collections include industrial and trading history, paintings by [[Gerard Terborch]] and [[Han van Meegeren]], silver objects, and prehistoric findings). [[Thea Beckman]]'s novel ''Het wonder van Frieswijck'' ("The Frieswijck Miracle") features the Waag.
** On the outer wall of the Waag hung until 2016 a large kettle that is over 500 years old, said to have been used for a [[public execution]] in the late [[Middle Ages]]; a man who had produced counterfeit coins was cooked to death in it. According to local tradition, there are holes in the kettle shot by footmen of [[Napoleon]]'s army around 1809. In 2017 the kettle has been placed inside the building, at the entrance of the museum.
* The Speelgoedmuseum ([[Toy]] Museum) behind the Waag, housed in an old house in the city called ''De Drie Haringen'' ('The Three Herrings').
* The [[Great Synagogue of Deventer]] in [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance style]] with [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] influences.
* The medieval [[St Nicholas Church, Deventer|Bergkerk]] (Mountain Church), on top of a small hill (old river dune), now a place for expositions and concerts.
* The old streets around the Bergkerk, known as Bergkwartier (Mountain Quarter) situated on and around the old river dune.
* The Broederenkerk (Friars church) in Gothic and neo-Gothic style
* The Stadsarchief en Athenaeumbibliotheek (City Archive and Athenaeum Library), the oldest scientific library of the Netherlands (founded in 1560).

[[File:Stadion de Adelaarshorst.jpg|thumb|[[De Adelaarshorst]] Stadium]]
Deventer is the home of professional Football club [[Go Ahead Eagles]], who are housed in stadium [[De Adelaarshorst]]. De Adelaarshorst is situated in a 1930s neighbourhood and one of the oldest stadiums still in use today.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The club was founded in 1902 as Be Quick, although the name was soon changed to Go Ahead at the request of the [[Royal Dutch Football Association|Dutch Football Association]]. The suffix Eagles was added in 1971, following a suggestion from the then coach, [[Barry Hughes]]. Go Ahead Eagles has been the club of [[Marc Overmars]], [[Paul Bosvelt]], and [[Bert van Marwijk]], whilst providing [[Henk ten Cate]] and [[Leo Beenhakker]] with their first experience of management.

The 1992 founded skating rink De Scheg, which is semi-indoor since 2011, is in the top 10 of fastest skating tracks of the Netherlands.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} It has been the training accommodation of skaters including Olympic champion [[Mark Tuitert]] and the retired former world champion sprint [[Erben Wennemars]].

Deventer also houses a number of watersports clubs, due to its situation on the banks of the river IJssel.

===Events and festivals===
* In the first weekend of July, the city centre is the scene of the open air festival "Deventer op stelten" (Deventer on [[Stilts]]). Actors and artists give performances in the streets and on the Brink square. Originally all actors used stilts during their acts.
* In August, Deventer is home to Europe's largest book fair, attracting 125,000 visitors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deventerboekenmarkt.nl/index.php/informatie/informatie|title=Algemene informatie|website=www.deventerboekenmarkt.nl|access-date=2019-03-09|archive-date=2019-02-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190214082242/https://www.deventerboekenmarkt.nl/index.php/informatie/informatie|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Government ==

=== City council ===
[[File:Stadhuis Deventer 2019.jpg|thumb|The Deventer City Office (2015), built alongside the old City Hall]]
In the redivision elections of November 17, 2004 , a [[municipal executive]] was elected for the period 2005-2010. This municipal election was earlier than in the rest of the Netherlands, because the municipality of Deventer was merged with the then municipality of Bathmen. The March 2006 elections were therefore skipped.

An issue that has occupied the municipal council and public opinion in Deventer since 2006 was the housing of municipal officials and public services in a (new) municipal office adjacent to the old town hall of Deventer. In 2009, the college fell over it. At the end of January 2012, the Municipal Executive approved an adapted design for the new city office by architect [[Michiel Riedijk]]. However, a 'popular poll' by telephone two weeks later would have shown that only 13% of the population of Deventer supported the plans. On March 21 that year, a large majority of the city council voted in favor of the municipal office. In October 2013, the Council of State ruled positive about the arrival of the municipal office, after objections were raised. On December 6 of that year, the official opening act for construction was performed. In December 2015, the complex was completed and municipal staff moved in. In November 2017, the architect received the Abe Bonnema Prize for the design.

[[File:Saxion Deventer 2012.jpg|thumb|[[Saxion University of Applied Sciences]]]]
Deventer is also home to one of the three campuses of [[Saxion University of Applied Sciences]] (''Saxion Hogeschool''), a [[Vocational universities in The Netherlands|polytechnical school]] offering internationally recognized [[Bachelor's degrees]] and [[Master's degrees]] in a wide range of fields, including engineering, economics, social work, investigations and health care.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Saxion|title=Get Ready for a Smart World {{!}} Saxion University of Applied Sciences {{!}} Saxion|url=https://www.saxion.edu/|access-date=2021-10-23|website=Hogeschool Saxion|language=en}}</ref> The other campuses are located in [[Enschede]] and [[Apeldoorn]].

In 1912 the [[Van Hall Larenstein|Secondary Colonial Agricultural School]] was founded, which grew out of the National Agricultural School Wageningen. After decolonization took effect, the name was changed into Tropical Agricultural School. In 1957 the school was transformed into the National Higher School for Tropical Agriculture. After a merger with study programs from Boskoop, Wageningen and Velp, it became the International Agricultural College Larenstein. The school was located at the Ceintuurbaan/Brinkgreverweg intersection. The building was given a residential destination in 2018.

==Transport==

=== Rail ===
[[File:Deventer Stationsgebouw.JPG|thumb|[[Deventer railway station]]]]
Since 1989, Deventer has two train stations, [[Deventer railway station]] and [[Deventer Colmschate railway station|Deventer Colmschate station]]. Previously, Deventer has known several so-called stopping points. Most of them closed around 1920. In addition to the current rail connections from Deventer train station, over the [[Arnhem–Leeuwarden railway]], [[Apeldoorn–Deventer railway]], and [[Deventer–Almelo railway]] lines, a train connection existed from 1910 to 1935 on the [[Deventer–Ommen railway]] line. This was operated by the Overijsselsche Lokaalspoorweg-Maatschappij Deventer - Ommen (OLDO), but had to stop the train service due to competition from the bus.

=== Public transport ===
[[File:Busstation Deventer.jpg|left|thumb|A bus station in Deventer]]
In the 19th and 20th centuries, Deventer was connected to the extensive tram network of the [[Achterhoek]]. The tram line between Deventer and [[Borculo]] was operated from 1885 to 1944 by the Geldersch-Overijsselsche Stoomtram Maatschappij (GOSM) and its successors. Another tram company, the ''Tramweg Maatschappij Zutphen-Emmerik'', operated the tram line between Deventer and Zutphen. The tram station of Deventer stood on the Pothoofd. It was not combined with Deventer train station because the trams were too heavy to drive over two intermediate bridges. It seemed unprofitable for the tram company to reinforce two bridges, so they used the Pothoofd as a terminal station. After the [[World War II|Second World War]], the tram lines were dismantled.

Since the end of 2020, bus transport has been provided by [[Keolis Nederland]] under the name ''RRReis'', with the exception of the lines from the Achterhoek, which are provided by [[Arriva]].
