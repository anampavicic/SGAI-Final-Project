'''Debre Birhan''' ({{Lang-am|ደብረ ብርሃን}})<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Abyssinia#7 |display=Abyssinia: (7) Provinces and Towns |volume=1 |page=86}}</ref> is a city in central [[Ethiopia]]. Located in the [[Semien Shewa Zone (Amhara)|Semien Shewa Zone]] of [[Amhara Region]], about 120 kilometers north east of [[Addis Ababa]] on  [[Ethiopian highway 2]], the town has an elevation of 2,840 meters, which makes it the highest town in Africa. It was an early capital of Ethiopia and afterwards, with [[Ankober]] and [[Angolalla Tera|Angolalla]], was one of the capitals of the kingdom of [[Shewa]]. Today, it is the administrative center of the [[North Shewa Zone (Amhara)|North Shewa Zone]] of the Amhara Region.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Debre Birhan was founded by [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Zara Yaqob]], in response to a [[miraculous]] light that was seen in the sky at the time. Believing this was a sign from [[God]] showing his approval for the death by [[stoning]] of a group of heretics 38 days before, the emperor ordered a church built on the site, and later constructed an extensive palace nearby, and a second church, dedicated to [[Saint Cyriacus]]. Zara Yaqob spent 12 of the last 14 years of his life in Debre Birhan.

Historian [[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard Pankhurst]] offers the date of 1456 for the date of the founding of this church, providing a plausible argument that the light in the sky was [[Halley's Comet]], which could have been seen in Shewa that year, although the traditional dates (10th day of the month of Maggabit, i.e. 6 or 7 March) do not coincide with the days that the comet was most visible (13 through 17 June).<ref>{{cite book |last= Pankhurst|first= Richard K. P.|title= History of Ethiopian Towns|year= 1982|publisher= Franz Steiner Verlag|location= Wiesbaden|page = 37}}</ref>

While his son [[Baeda Maryam of Ethiopia|Baeda Maryam]] did spend the first part of his reign in Debre Birhan, eventually Baeda Maryam returned to the established itinerant practice of living in a permanent encampment that was constantly on the move through the realm. The departure of the court led to a decline in the population and importance of this town. Pankhurst explains that the needs of the imperial court and army—who numbered in the thousands—for firewood and food was so burdensome that, "it could not remain in any one locality for more than four months, nor return to the same place in less than 10 years due to the resultant shortage of food",<ref>Pankhurst, ''Ethiopian Towns'', p. 41</ref> which prevented the growth of any capital city in this period.

=== 16th-18th century ===
While little more than a large village, Debre Birhan is mentioned a few times in the 16th century, the first time as a mustering center by Emperor [[Lebna Dengel]] against the invading armies of [[Ahmad Gragn]].<ref>Sihab ad-Din Ahmad bin 'Abd al-Qader, ''Futuh al-Habasa: The conquest of Ethiopia'', translated by Paul Lester Stenhouse with annotations by Richard Pankhurst (Hollywood: Tsehai, 2003), p. 59.</ref> After he had defeated Lebna Dengel at the [[Battle of Amba Sel]], Ahmad mustered his troops twice in Debre Birhan before leading them on campaigns deeper into Ethiopian territory. At the second mustering in 1535, he proclaimed before his followers, "Thanks be to God, Abyssinia is conquered. Only [[Tigray Province|Tigray]], [[Begemder]] and [[Gojjam]] are left... Shall we march against them, or shall we stay on in this region for a year until we have settled it down?" then led them into the [[Ethiopian highlands]].<ref>Sihab ad-Din Ahmad, ''Futuh al-Habasa'', pp. 337f.</ref>

=== 19th century ===
The village regained importance in the reign of [[Asfaw Wossen (ruler of Shewa)|Asfaw Wossen]] (1775–1808), [[Rulers of Shewa|Meridazmach of Shewa]], who built a palace there, and divided his time amongst this town, Ankober and Angolalla.<ref>Pankhurst, ''Ethiopian Towns'', pp. 188f</ref> The succeeding Meridazmaches prized Debre Birhan as a hunting lodge for its surrounding plains, and used it as a riding place.<ref>Pankhurst, ''Ethiopian Towns'', p. 280</ref> His son [[Sahle Selassie]] rebuilt Debre Birhan after it had been ravaged by [[Abichu Oromo]] at the beginning of his reign, and built a church dedicated to the Selassie ("[[Trinity]]") in this capital.<ref>{{cite book |last= Abir|first= Mordechai |title= Ethiopia: The Era of the Princes; The Challenge of Islam and the Re-unification of the Christian Empire (1769-1855)|year= 1968|publisher= Longmans|location= London|pages=152f}}</ref>

When then [[Negus]] [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik]] submitted to Emperor [[Yohannes IV of Ethiopia|Yohannes IV]] in the treaty of Wadara of 1878, it was also stipulated that the capital of Shewa would be moved from [[Liche]] to Debre Birhan.<ref>{{cite book |last= Marcus|first= Harold G.|title= The Life and Times of Menelik II: Ethiopia 1844-1913|year= 1995|publisher=Red Sea Press|location= Lawrenceville|isbn= 1-56902-010-8|page = 55}}</ref>

The Debre Birhan market in the 1880s was considered important for mules and horses. The Selassie church was rebuilt by Emperor Menilek in 1906 and contains many mural paintings.<ref name=NAI-website>[http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/d/ORTDEB1.pdf "Local History in Ethiopia"]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 16 December 2007)</ref> David Buxton believes that it was inevitable that Debre Berhan would regain importance, "Although a somewhat cold and inhospitable place," he writes about the town, "it has an obvious advantage as commanding what must always have been an important focus of routes. Even in modern times it was inevitable that the Asmara road should be brought through this easy passage, avoiding the impassable gorges on the other."<ref>D. R. Buxton, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1789582 "The Shoan Plateau and Its People: An Essay in Local Geography", ''Geographical Journal''], 114, (1949), p. 162</ref>

=== 20th century ===
Debre Berhan received electricity in 1955 when a 90&nbsp;kW hydro-electric power station was put into service; by 1965, the installed electrical capacity in the town was 125 kVA and annual production 103,000 kWh. On 26 April 1957, Emperor [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]] opened the Community Teacher Training School in the town.<ref>"Opens Debre Berhan Teacher Training Center", ''Selected Speeches of His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie I'', New York : One Drop Books, 2000, pp.76-79</ref> By 1958 it was one of 27 places in Ethiopia ranked as First Class Township.<ref name=NAI-website/>

On 2 July 1994 it was broadcast that nine people were killed and eleven captured in an exchange of fire with security forces in [[Angolalla Terana Asagirt|Asagirt]] woreda. The people were alleged to have broken into the Debre Berhan prison before that, setting a number of prisoners free. According to the police, Andale Melaklu, the Debre Berhan representative of the [[All-Amhara People's Organization]] was one of the "bandits" killed in the fire exchange.<ref name=NAI-website/>

== Demographics ==

== Local economy ==
Debre Birhan is located along [[Ethiopian Highway 2]], which connects [[Addis Abeba]] with the north of the country. The gravel road between Debre Birhan and Ankober, 42 kilometers in length, was overhauled in May 2009.<ref>[http://www.ena.gov.et/EnglishNews/2009/May/29May09/88660.htm "42-km Debrebirhan-Ankober road being maintained"]{{dead link|date=September 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}, [[Ethiopian News Agency]], 29 May 2009 (accessed 30 May 2009)</ref>

The Debre Birhan Wool Factory, the first wool factory in Ethiopia, started production was 1 January 1965 with 120 spindles and 6 looms, having the capacity to process one metric ton of wool daily. In its first six months, the factory produced 7,065 blankets in a single-shift operation with a labor force of about 200, of whom 45% were women. The [[Derg]] government announced 3 February 1975 that the Debre Birhan Wool Factory was among 14 textile enterprises to be fully nationalised.<ref name="NAI-website" />

Debre Birhan is also a famed center of [[rug making]].

==Education==
[[Debre Berhan University]] is located in Debre Berhan city.  Amhara Region, Ethiopia. It is one of thirteen new universities which were established in 2007 by the Ethiopian government.

== Landmarks ==
Despite its historical importance, none of the buildings Emperor Zara Yaqob built exist today due to the fact that the sixteenth century Adal leader [[Ahmed ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] ordered their destruction, and no obvious 19th century construction is visible.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dabra Birhan |publisher=Encyclopedia Aethiopica |url=https://en.sewasew.com/p/da-bra-birhan-(%E1%8B%B0%E1%89%A5%E1%88%A8-%E1%89%A5%E1%88%AD%E1%88%83%E1%8A%95) |access-date=19 August 2022 |archive-date=8 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230308201746/https://en.sewasew.com/p/da-bra-birhan-%28%E1%8B%B0%E1%89%A5%E1%88%A8-%E1%89%A5%E1%88%AD%E1%88%83%E1%8A%95%29 |url-status=live }}</ref> The present church, although located on the site of the 15th century church, was built in 1906 at the orders of Emperor [[Menelik II]].
