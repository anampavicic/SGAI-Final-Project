According to a legend, one could find a lake in Kabul, in the middle of which the so-called "Island of Happiness" could be found, where a joyous family of musicians lived.<ref name="OxfordModern" /> According to this same legend, the island became accessible by the order of a king through the construction of a bridge (i.e. "pul" in Persian) made out of straw (i.e. "kah" in Persian).<ref name="OxfordModern" /> According to this legend the name Kabul was thus formed as a result of these two words combined, i.e. ''kah'' + ''pul''.<ref name="OxfordModern" /> The ''Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Place Names'' argues that the "suggestion that the name is derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] root ''qbl'' 'meeting' or 'receiving' is unlikely".<ref name="OxfordPlaceNames" />

It remains unknown when the name "Kabul" was first applied to the city.<ref name="OxfordModern" /> It "came into prominence" following the destruction of [[Kapisi|Kapisa]] and other cities in what is present-day Afghanistan by [[Genghis Khan]] (c. 1162–1227) in the thirteenth century.<ref name="OxfordModern" /> The centrality of the city within the region, as well as its cultural importance as a nexus of ethnic groups in the region, caused Kabul to become known as the Paris of Central Asia in the late 20th century.

Jews were generally tolerated for most of their time in Afghanistan, up until the passage of anti-Jewish laws in the 1870s. Jews were given a reprieve under the rule of King [[Mohammad Nadir Shah|Nadir Shah]] until his assassination in 1933. The influence of Nazi propaganda led to increased violence against Jews and the [[Ghetto|ghettoization]] of their communities in Kabul and [[Herat]]. Most of Afghanistan's Jews fled the country or congregated in these urban hubs.<ref name=":5" />

After the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|establishment of the state of Israel]], the Jewish community requested permission from King [[Mohammad Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]] to migrate there. Afghanistan was the only country that allowed its Jewish residents to migrant to Israel without relinquishing their citizenship.<ref name=":3" /> Most of those remaining, approximately 2,000 in number, left after the [[Soviet invasion of Afganhistan|Soviet invasion]] in 1979.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4" />

As of 1992, there were believed to be two Jews remaining in Afghanistan, both living in a synagogue in Kabul.<ref name=":4" /> The congregation's [[Torah scroll]] was confiscated during the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (1996–2001)|first Islamic Emirate]]. [[Zablon Simintov|Zebulon Simontov]] was believed and widely reported to be Afghanistan's last Jew, until [[Tova Moradi]] fled months after him, with her grandchildren. Moradi, who harbored a rabbi in her home throughout the first Islamic Emirate, lived in [[Murad Khani|Morad Khane]], Kabul for decades. While she was married to a Muslim man as a child, she still covertly attended synagogue and tried to teach her children what Hebrew prayers she could remember from her childhood. As of her departure in November 2021, there are believed to be no Jews in Afghanistan.<ref name=":2" />

In one of them, [[Abdur Rahman bin Samara]] arrived in Kabul from [[Zaranj]] in the late 600s and converted 12,000 inhabitants to [[Islam]] before abandoning the city. [[Muslim]]s were a minority until [[Ya'qub bin Laith as-Saffar]] of Zaranj conquered Kabul in 870 from the [[Hindu Shahis]] and established the first [[Saffarid dynasty|Islamic dynasty]] in the region. It was reported that the rulers of Kabul were [[Muslim]]s with non-Muslims living close by. Iranian traveller and geographer [[Istakhri]] described it in 921:

{{blockquote|Kábul has a castle celebrated for its strength, accessible only by one road. In it there are [[Muslim|Musulmáns]], and it has a town, in which are [[Kalasha (religion)|infidels]] from [[Hindustan|Hind]].<ref name="Elliot-3">{{cite web |url=http://persian.packhum.org/persian/pf?file=80201012&ct=100 |title=A.—The Hindu Kings of Kábul (p.3) |work=Sir H.

Over the following centuries, the city was successively controlled by the [[Samanids]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Ghurids]], [[Khwarazmian Empire|Khwarazmshahs]], [[Qarlughids]], and [[Khalji dynasty|Khaljis]]. In the 13th century, the invading [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] caused major destruction in the region. Report of a [[massacre]] in the close by [[Bamiyan]] is recorded around this period, where the entire population of the valley was annihilated by the Mongol troops as revenge for the death of Genghis Khan's grandson. As a result, many natives of Afghanistan fled south toward the Indian subcontinent where some established [[Delhi Sultanate|dynasties in Delhi]]. The [[Chagatai Khanate]] and [[Kartids]] were vassals of [[Ilkhanate]] until the dissolution of the latter in 1335.

Following the era of the Khalji dynasty in 1333, the famous [[Morocco|Moroccan]] scholar [[Ibn Battuta]] was visiting Kabul and wrote:
{{blockquote|We travelled on to Kabul, formerly a vast town, the site of which is now occupied by a village inhabited by a tribe of Persians called Afghans.

[[File:Horsemen assembled outside the city walls at Kabul, Afghanis Wellcome V0050453.jpg|thumb|Old painting showing the [[Bala Hissar, Kabul|Great Wall]] of Kabul]]In the 14th century, Kabul became a major trading centre under the kingdom of [[Timur]] (''Tamerlane''). In 1504, the city fell to [[Babur]] from the north and made into his headquarters, which became one of the principal cities of his later [[Mughal Empire]]. In 1525, Babur described [[Kabulistan]] in [[baburnama|his memoirs]] by writing that:

{{blockquote|There are many differing tribes in the [[Kabulistan|Kābul country]]; in its dales and plains are Turks and clansmen and [[Arab|'Arabs]]; and in its town and in many villages, [[Sart|Sārts]]; out in the districts and also in villages are the [[Pashai people|Pashāi]], [[Parachi|Parājī]], [[Tajiks|Tājik]], [[Ormur|Bīrkī]] and [[Afghan (name)|Afghān]] tribes. In the western mountains are the [[Hazara people|Hazāra]] and [[Qara'unas|Nikdīrī]] tribes, some of whom speak the [[Moghol language|Mughūlī]] tongue. In the north-eastern mountains are the places of the [[Kafiristan|Kāfirs]], such as [[Katawar|Kitūr and Gibrik]]. To the south are the places of the [[Pashtunistan|Afghān tribes]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/44608/44608-h/44608-h.htm |title=Description of Kābul |access-date=June 21, 2021 |author=[[Babur|Zahir ud-Din Mohammad Babur]] |work=[[Baburnama|Memoirs of Babur]] |publisher=Packard Humanities Institute |year=1525 |archive-date=June 30, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200630231822/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44608/44608-h/44608-h.htm |url-status=live}}</ref>}}

[[Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat]], a poet from [[Hindustan]] who visited at the time wrote: ''"Dine and drink in Kabul: it is mountain, desert, city, river and all else."'' It was from here that Babur began his 1526 conquest of Hindustan, which was ruled by the [[Pashtun people|Afghan]] [[Lodi dynasty]] and began east of the [[Indus River]] in what is present-day [[Pakistan]]. [[Babur]] loved Kabul due to the fact that he lived in it for 20 years and the people were loyal to him, including the weather that he was used to. His wish to be buried in Kabul was finally granted. The inscription on his [[Gardens of Babur|tomb]] contains the famous Persian [[couplet]], which states:

اگرفردوس روی زمین است همین است و همین است و همین است

In 1826, the kingdom was claimed by [[Dost Mohammad Khan]], but in 1839 [[Shah Shujah Durrani|Shujah Shah Durrani]] was re-installed with the help of the [[British Empire]] during the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]]. In 1841 a local uprising resulted in the killing of the British resident and loss of mission in Kabul and the [[1842 retreat from Kabul]] to [[Jalalabad]], in which 4,500 regular British troops and 14,000 civilians were killed by Afghan tribesmen. In 1842 the British returned to Kabul, demolishing the city's main ''[[bazaar]]'' in revenge during the [[Kabul Expedition (1842)]] before returning to [[Company rule in India|British India]] (now Pakistan). [[Wazir Akbar Khan|Akbar Khan]] took to the throne from 1842 to 1845 and was followed by Dost Mohammad Khan.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Story Map Cascade |url=https://www.loc.gov/ghe/cascade/index.html?appid=a0930b1f4e424987ba68c28880f088ea |access-date=2023-06-20 |website=Library of Congress |archive-date=17 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210817041928/https://loc.gov/ghe/cascade/index.html?appid=a0930b1f4e424987ba68c28880f088ea |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] broke out in 1879 when Kabul was under [[Sher Ali Khan]]'s rule, as the Afghan king initially refused to accept British diplomatic missions and later the British residents were again massacred. During the war, Bala Hissar was partially destroyed by a fire and an explosion.<ref name="lib">Caption for Panorama of the Bala Hissar WDL11486 Library of Congress</ref>

The city was modernised throughout the regime of King [[Habibullah Khan]], with the introduction of electricity, telephone, and a postal service.<ref>Tanin, Z. (2006): Afghanistan in the 20th Century. Tehran.</ref> The first modern high school, [[Habibia High School|Habibia]], was established in 1903. In 1919, after the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]], King [[Amanullah Khan]] announced Afghanistan's independence in [[Foreign relations of Afghanistan|foreign affairs]] at [[Id Gah Mosque|Eidgah Mosque]] in Kabul. Amanullah was reform-minded and he had a plan to build a new [[capital city]] on land 6&nbsp;km from Kabul. This area, named [[Darulaman]], consisted of the famous [[Darul Aman Palace]], where he later resided. Many educational institutions were founded in Kabul during the 1920s. In 1929 King Amanullah left Kabul after a local uprising orchestrated by [[Habibullah Kalakani]], but he was imprisoned and executed after nine months in power by King [[Mohammed Nadir Shah|Nader Khan]]. Three years later, in 1933, the new king was assassinated during an award ceremony in a school in Kabul. The throne was left to his 19-year-old son, [[Mohammad Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]], who became the last [[King of Afghanistan]]. Unlike Amanullah Khan, Nader Khan and Zahir Shah had no plans to create a new capital city, and thus Kabul remained the country's [[seat of government]].

The Soviets turned the city of Kabul into their command centre during the [[Soviet–Afghan War]], and while fighting was mostly taking place in the countryside, Kabul was widely disturbed. Political crime and guerrilla attacks on military and government targets were common, and the sound of gunfire became commonplace at night in the outskirts. Large numbers of [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|PDPA]] party members and Soviet troops were kidnapped or assassinated, sometimes in broad daylight, with acts of terrorism committed by civilians, anti-regime militias and also [[Khalq]]ists. By July 1980, as many as twelve party members were being assassinated on a daily basis, and the Soviet Army stopped patrolling the city in January 1981. A major uprising against the Soviet presence broke out in Kabul in February 1980 in what is called the [[3 Hut uprising]].

[[File:Kabul mountains.jpg|thumb|A view of some of the mountains that surround Kabul]]
Kabul was situated in the eastern part of the country, {{convert|1791|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] in a narrow valley, wedged between the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains along the [[Kabul River]]. Immediately to the south of the old city are the ancient city walls and the Sher Darwaza mountain, with the Shuhadayi Salihin [[cemetery]] behind it. A bit further east is the ancient [[Bala Hissar, Kabul|Bala Hissar]] fortress with the Kol-e Hasmat Khan lake behind it.

Its location has been described as a "bowl surrounded by mountains".<ref>''Canada in Afghanistan: The War So Far'' by Peter Pigott</ref> Some of the mountains (which are called ''koh'') include: Khair Khana-e Shamali, Khwaja Rawash, Shakhi Baran Tey, Chihil Sutun, Qurugh, Khwaja Razaq and Sher Darwaza. There are also two mountains in between urban areas to the west: [[Koh-e Asamai]] (locally known as the ''Television hill'') and Ali Abad. Hills within the city (which are called ''tapa'') include Bibi Mahro and Maranjan.

The [[Logar River]] flows into Kabul from the south, joining the Kabul River not far from the city centre.

The city covers an area size of {{convert|1023|km2|sqmi|0}}, making it by far the largest in the country. The closest foreign capital cities [[as the crow flies]] are [[Islamabad]], [[Dushanbe]], [[Tashkent]], [[New Delhi]] and [[Bishkek]]. Kabul is roughly [[equidistant]] between [[Istanbul]] (western Asia) and [[Hanoi]] (eastern Asia).

===Climate===
Kabul has a continental, [[cold semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|BSk]]), with precipitation concentrated in the winter (almost exclusively falling as [[snow]]) and spring months. Summers have very low [[humidity]], providing some relief from the heat. Autumns feature warm afternoons and sharply cooler evenings. Winters are very cold by [[South Asia]]n standards, with a subzero January daily average temperature of {{convert|-2.3|°C|1}}, mainly due to the high elevation of the city. Spring is the wettest time of the year. Sunny conditions dominate year-round, and the annual mean temperature is only {{convert|12.1|°C|1}}, much lower than that of Afghanistan's other large cities.

===Environment===
The [[Kabul River]] flows through the heart of the city, dividing the central bazaars. There are several bridges (''pul'') crossing the river, the major ones being Pul-e Shah-Do Shamshira, Pul-e Bagh-e Omomi, Pul-e Khishti, and Pul-e Mahmoud. Due to [[climate change]], since the 21st century, the river runs dry most of the year, only filling up in the wetter winter and spring seasons.<ref>http://kbr.id/english/11-2016/in_kabul__where_the_rivers_run_dry_/wo {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211122095656/https://kbr.id/english/11-2016/in_kabul__where_the_rivers_run_dry_/wo |date=22 November 2021 }} 86710.html</ref>

===Districts===
[[File:Afghanistan Kabul Province Kabul District.png|thumb|Location of Kabul Municipality within Kabul Province]]
The city of Kabul located within [[Kabul District]], one of the 15 districts of [[Kabul Province]]. As the provincial capital, it forms a [[municipality]] (''shārwāli'') which is further divided into 22 [[administrative district]]s called municipal districts or city districts (''nāhia''), which coincide with the official Police Districts (PD).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Foschini |first1=Fabrizio |title=A geographical guide to a metropolis in the making |url=https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kabul-Police-Districts.pdf |website=www.afghanistan-analysts.org |access-date=4 June 2019 |archive-date=4 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604121049/https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kabul-Police-Districts.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref> The number of city districts increased from 11 to 18 in 2005, and then to 22 by 2010 after the incorporation of Districts 14 and 19–22 which were annexed by Kabul Municipality from surrounding rural districts. The [[city limits]] have thus substantially increased. Due to demarcation disputes with the provincial administration, some of these new districts are more administered by the provincial districts than the municipality.

District 1 contains most of the old city. Downtown Kabul mostly consist of Districts 2, 4 and 10. In addition, Districts 3 and 6 house many commercial and governmental points of interests.<ref name="iwaweb.org">{{cite web |title=Community Scorecard of Kabul Municipality 2016 |url=https://iwaweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/KBL-Municipality-CSC-FINAL-REPORT.pdf |website=iwaweb.org |access-date=22 February 2018 |archive-date=23 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223050735/https://iwaweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/KBL-Municipality-CSC-FINAL-REPORT.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref> The city's north and west are the most urbanised, as opposed to the south and east.

Kabul's population was estimated in 2023 at about 4.95&nbsp;million.<ref name="nsia" /> The city's population has long fluctuated due to the wars. The lack of an up-to-date [[census]] means that there are various estimates of the population.

Kabul's population was estimated to have been about 10,000 in 1700, 65,000 by 1878, and 120,000 by 1940.<ref name="pdf.usaid.gov" /> More recently, the population was around 500,000 in 1979, whilst another source claims 337,715 as of 1976.<ref name="spvd.cz">{{cite web |title=Trolleybuses in Kabul |url=http://www.spvd.cz/index.php/component/content/article/181-clanky/svet/af/217-afghanistan-en |website=www.spvd.cz |access-date=8 January 2017 |archive-date=14 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114233944/http://www.spvd.cz/index.php/component/content/article/181-clanky/svet/af/217-afghanistan-en |url-status=live}}</ref> This figure rose to about 1.5&nbsp;million by 1988, before dramatically dropping in the 1990s. Kabul became one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, with its population growing fourfold from 2001 to 2014. This was partly due to the return of refugees after the fall of the [[Taliban]] regime, and partly due to Afghans moving from other provinces mainly due to war between Taliban insurgents and Afghan government forces in their native areas as well as looking for labor. This resulting rapid [[urbanisation]] means that many residents today live in informal settlements.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/dec/11/kabul-afghanistan-fifth-fastest-growing-city-world-rapid-urbanisation |title=Kabul – the fifth fastest growing city in the world – is bursting at the seams |first=Sune Engel |last=Rasmussen |date=11 December 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=8 January 2017 |archive-date=9 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109115432/https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/dec/11/kabul-afghanistan-fifth-fastest-growing-city-world-rapid-urbanisation |url-status=live}}</ref> Shanty mud-brick homes on the mountainsides and steep hills have been built by them and these are usually poverty-stricken, not connected to the water and electricity grid.

The municipality's administrative structure consisted of 17 departments under a [[mayor]]. Like other provincial municipalities in Afghanistan, the municipality of Kabul dealt with city affairs such as construction and infrastructure. The city districts (''nāhia'') collected certain taxes and issued building licenses. Each city district had a district head appointed by the mayor, and lead six major departments in the district office. The neighbourhood organisation structure at the ''nahia'' level was called a ''gozar''. Kabul has been Divided in to 630 Gozars. A ''wakil-e gozar'' was a person chosen to represent a community within a city district.

Kabul's Chief of Police was Lt. Gen. Abdul Rahman Rahimi. The police were part of the [[Afghan National Police]] (ANP) under the [[Ministry of the Interior (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Interior]] and were arranged by city districts. The Police Chief was selected by the Interior Minister and is responsible for all [[law enforcement]] activities throughout the Kabul province.

==Culture and landmarks==
[[File:Bird Market Kabul.jpg|thumb|The Kabul Bird Market (''Ka Foroshi'')]]
The old part of Kabul was filled with [[bazaar]]s nestled along its narrow, crooked streets, examples being the Mandawi and the Bird Market (''Ka Foroshi''). Cultural sites included: the [[National Museum of Afghanistan]], notably displaying an impressive statue of [[Surya]] excavated at [[Khair Khana]], the ruined [[Darul Aman Palace]], the tomb of Mughal Emperor [[Babur]] at [[Bagh-e Babur]], and Chihil Sutun Park, the Minar-i-Istiqlal (Column of Independence) built in 1919 after the [[Third Afghan War]], the [[tomb of Timur Shah Durrani]], the [[Bagh-e Bala Palace]] and the imposing [[Id Gah Mosque]] (founded 1893). [[Bala Hissar, Kabul|Bala Hissar]] was a fort which was partially destroyed during the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]],<ref name="lib" /> then restored as a military college. There was also the [[Kolola Pushta]] fort, which was garrisoned by the Afghan Army, and the nearby 19th-century [[Shahrara Tower]] fort, which was ruined in 1928. The [[Koh-e Asamai]] mountain had a temple that was considered important to [[Hinduism]].

Other places of interest include [[Kabul City Center]], which was Kabul's first shopping mall, the shops around Flower Street and [[Chicken Street]], Wazir Akbar Khan district, [[Kabul Golf Club]], [[Kabul Zoo]], [[Abdul Rahman Mosque]], [[Shah-Do Shamshira Mosque|Shah-Do Shamshira]] and other famous mosques, the [[National Gallery of Afghanistan]], the [[National Archives of Afghanistan]], Afghan Royal Family Mausoleum, the [[OMAR Mine Museum]], Bibi Mahro Hill, Kabul Cemetery, and [[Paghman Gardens]] best known for the famous [[Taq-e Zafar]] arch. The Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) was also involved in the restoration of the [[Bagh-e Babur]] (Babur Gardens).

Maranjan Hill (''Tappe-i-Maranjan'') was a nearby hill where Buddhist [[statue]]s and Graeco-Bactrian [[coin]]s from the 2nd century BC have been found. Outside the city proper lied the Buddhist [[Guldara stupa]] and another stupa at [[Shewaki]]. [[Paghman]] and [[Jalalabad]] were interesting valleys west and east of the city. On the latter road, about 16 miles east of the city, was the [[Tang-e Gharu]] gorge.

Kabul used to have as many as 23 cinemas, but currently only had four, including the state owned [[Ariana Cinema]].

Kabul's various architectural designs reflected the various links it has had with empires and civilisations, particularly being on the ancient trade route connecting India and China with Persia and the West.<ref name="Architectural">{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351210427 |title=An evaluation of architectural monuments in Afghanistan as in the capital city, Kabul |date= |accessdate=22 November 2021 |archive-date=31 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210831215445/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351210427_An_evaluation_of_architectural_monuments_in_Afghanistan_as_in_the_capital_city_Kabul |url-status=live}}</ref>

The Buddhist [[Chakari, Afghanistan|Chakari minaret]] was likely built in the [[Kushan Empire|Kushan]] era and had traces of [[Greco-Bactrian]] and [[Gandhara Art]]. It had Buddhist [[swastika]] and both [[Mahayana]] and [[Theravada]] qualities. Following the Islamic conquest, a new age of architectural realms appeared in the Kabul region. The [[Gardens of Babur]] was perhaps the best preserved example of Islamic and [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]] architecture. Emperor [[Babur]] had also built seven other big gardens in Kabul at the time. The present Gardens of Babur also reflect Afghanistan's traditional architecture by the wooden carving, pressed stucco, decorative stone masonry and other features. Another fine example of the Babur era is the [[Id Gah Mosque]], using stones from the [[Punjab]] and [[Sindh]] and designed by Persians.<ref name="Architectural" />

[[Ahmad Shah Durrani]]'s rise as the Afghan ruler brought changes to Kabul and the nation, with a more inward-looking and self-protecting society reflecting the architecture that were no different between the rich and poor peoples. mausoleum of [[Timur Shah Durrani]], the Afghan ruler until his death in 1793, was another example of Islamic design, built in an octagonal structure. It followed [[Central Asian]] traditions of decorative brick masonries along with a colorless appearance.<ref name="Architectural" /> After the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]], the country's emir [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] brought European styles for the first time. The [[Bagh-e Bala Palace]] was designed in a mixed Mughal and British Indian style, the first significant change from traditional Afghan and Islamic styles. However, palaces were still built with Central Asian Islamic design at heart. Numerous lavish buildings were created during this time, combined with large gardens. The Dilkusha Palace within the [[Arg (Kabul)|Arg]] was the first created by a British architect.<ref name="Architectural" /> Its accompanying [[clock tower]], {{Circa|1911}}, was also a British creation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://president.gov.af/da/?page_id=7974&__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_CSd7GgyLGlddS4GBluZjdT2fBgdRKTgObtPbA_qeyNg-1630516942-0-gqNtZGzNAeWjcnBszQel |title=Arg clock tower |website=president.gov.af |access-date=1 September 2021 |archive-date=1 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210901172453/https://president.gov.af/da/?page_id=7974&__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_CSd7GgyLGlddS4GBluZjdT2fBgdRKTgObtPbA_qeyNg-1630516942-0-gqNtZGzNAeWjcnBszQel |url-status=live}}</ref>

Houses in Kabul during this time were generally made up of walled compounds, built around courtyards and having narrow passageways to places.<ref name="ReutersHomes">{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/afghanistan-cities-homes-idUSL8N2IJ3CF |title=Push to modernise takes toll on Kabul's historical homes |newspaper=Reuters |date=10 December 2020 |via=www.reuters.com |access-date=2 September 2021 |archive-date=2 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210902003948/https://www.reuters.com/article/afghanistan-cities-homes-idUSL8N2IJ3CF |url-status=live}}</ref>

In the 1920s, new styles were strongly influenced by European architectural styles due to king [[Amanullah Khan]]'s visits to Europe, particularly Berlin and Paris. [[Darul Aman Palace]] was the best known example of modern Western design. The [[Shah-Do Shamshira Mosque]] was built in an unusual style for a mosque in Western and Italian style [[baroque]]. The [[Taq-e Zafar]] in [[Paghman]] and other landmarks there were also based on European designs.<ref name="Architectural" /> Houses also became more open, without having many of the walls.<ref name="ReutersHomes" /> Later in the century, several [[Soviet]] inspired designs made its way into Kabul. Most notable of these were the various ''[[microraion]]''s built in the city in the 1960s and afterwards. A different flavor of modern style was seen on the [[Hotel Inter-Continental Kabul]] and [[Kabul Serena Hotel|Serena Hotel]].<ref name="Architectural" />

In the 21st century, modern designs based on glass facades became popular. Examples of this modern Western style were the [[Kabul City Center]] and [[Golbahar Center]]. The [[National Assembly (Afghanistan)|National Assembly]] building opened in 2015 had elements of modern Islamic [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]] architecture, considered to have the largest dome in Asia. The Indian architecture could also be influenced by the fact it was built by the government of India, but its carving and large porch represent Afghan traditional architectural forms.<ref name="Architectural" /> The new [[Ministry of Defense (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Defense]] building followed traditional, Islamic and Western designs inspired by [[the Pentagon]]. Another mix of these designs appeared on the [[Paghman Hill Castle]] completed in 2014.<ref name="Architectural" /> Increasing numbers of high rises have been built in this period, with the Kabul Markaz tower in 2020 becoming the city's first to break the {{convert|100|m|ft}} tall barrier.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.emporis.com/buildings/1438696/kabul-markaz-residential-tower-1-kabul-afghanistan |title=Kabul Markaz Residential Tower 1, Kabul &#124; 1438696 |publisher=Emporis |date= |accessdate=22 November 2021 |archive-date=31 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210831182138/https://www.emporis.com/buildings/1438696/kabul-markaz-residential-tower-1-kabul-afghanistan |url-status=usurped}}</ref> The construction boom with modern [[High-rise building|high-rises]] throughout the 2010s had led to a major change in the city's skyline.<ref name="ReutersHomes" />

[[File:Flightline at Kabul International Airport.jpeg|thumb|Flightline at [[Kabul International Airport|Hamid Karzai International Airport]] (Kabul International Airport), 2012]]

Kabul has no train service.<ref name="andrewgrantham.co.uk" />

===Air===
[[Kabul International Airport]] is located {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} from the centre of Kabul. It is a hub to [[Ariana Afghan Airlines]], the national carrier of Afghanistan, as well as private airlines such as [[Afghan Jet International]], [[East Horizon Airlines]], [[Kam Air]], [[Pamir Airways]], and [[Safi Airways]]. Regional airlines such as [[Air India]], [[SpiceJet]], [[flydubai]], [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], [[Gulf Air]], [[Mahan Air]], [[Pakistan International Airlines]], [[Turkish Airlines]] and others also had regularly scheduled flights to the airport.

===Road===
The [[AH76]] highway (or Kabul-Charikar Highway) connected Kabul north towards [[Charikar]], [[Pol-e Khomri]] and [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] ({{convert|310|km|mi|abbr=on}} away), with leading roads to [[Kunduz]] ({{convert|250|km|mi|abbr=on}} away). The [[AH77]] highway went west towards [[Bamiyan Province]] ({{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} away) and [[Chaghcharan]] in the central mountains of Afghanistan. To the south-west, the Kabul-Ghazni Highway went to [[Ghazni]] ({{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} away) and [[Kandahar]] ({{convert|460|km|mi|abbr=on}} away). To the south, the Kabul-Gardez Highway connected it to [[Gardez]] ({{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} away) and [[Khost]]. To the east, the Kabul-Jalalabad Highway went to [[Jalalabad]] ({{convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on}} away) and across the border to [[Peshawar]].

Much of the road network in downtown Kabul consisted of square or circle intersections (''char-rahi''). The main square in the city was Pashtunistan Square (named after [[Pashtunistan]]), which had a large [[fountain]] in it and was located adjacent to the presidential palace, the [[Da Afghanistan Bank|Central Bank]], and other landmarks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://baileyaplangandcomp.wordpress.com/2015/02/10/the-square-of-pashtunistan/ |title=The Square of Pashtunistan |date=10 February 2015 |access-date=3 March 2018 |archive-date=3 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303225748/https://baileyaplangandcomp.wordpress.com/2015/02/10/the-square-of-pashtunistan/ |url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Massoud Circle]] was located by the [[Embassy of the United States, Kabul|U.S. Embassy]] and had the road leading to the airport. In the old city, Sar-e Chawk roundabout was at the center of Maiwand Road (''[[Jadayi Maiwand]]''). Once all roads led to it, and in the 16th century was called the "navel of Kabul".<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8357427.stm |title=The place to take the Afghan pulse |date=12 November 2009 |access-date=3 March 2018 |archive-date=22 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211122095657/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/8357427.stm |url-status=live}}</ref> In the [[Shahr-e Naw]] district there were several major intersections: Ansari, Haji Yaqub, Quwayi Markaz, Sedarat, and Turabaz Khan. The latter, named after [[Turabaz Khan]], connected Flower Street and [[Chicken Street]]. There were also two major intersections in western Kabul: the [[Deh Mazang]] Circle and [[Kote Sangi]]. Salang Watt was the main road to the north-west, whereas Asamayi Watt and Seh Aqrab (also called Sevom Aqrab) was the main road to western Kabul.

The steep population rise in the 21st century had caused major congestion problems for the city's roads.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-asia-20509559/traffic-chaos-as-kabul-s-roads-are-improved |title=Roadworks bring traffic chaos to Kabul |work=BBC News |access-date=21 July 2018 |archive-date=22 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181022103627/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-asia-20509559/traffic-chaos-as-kabul-s-roads-are-improved |url-status=live}}</ref> In efforts to tackle this issue, a 95&nbsp;km outer [[ring road]] costing $110&nbsp;million was approved in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tolonews.com/afghanistan/officials-say-kabul-ring-road-construction-start-soon |title=Officials Say Kabul Ring Road Construction to Start Soon |access-date=20 January 2018 |archive-date=20 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120124329/http://www.tolonews.com/afghanistan/officials-say-kabul-ring-road-construction-start-soon |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://rta.org.af/eng/2017/09/17/idb-pays-74m-loan-for-construction-of-kabul-city-ring-road/ |title=IDB Pays $74m Loan For Construction of Kabul City Ring-Road |date=17 September 2017 |website=rta.org.af |access-date=22 November 2021 |archive-date=3 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180403205325/http://rta.org.af/eng/2017/09/17/idb-pays-74m-loan-for-construction-of-kabul-city-ring-road/ |url-status=live}}</ref> Construction would have taken five years and it will run from [[Char Asiab]] via [[Ahmad Shah Baba Mina]], [[Deh Sabz]] ("Kabul New City" development area), the AH76 highway, [[Paghman]] and back to Char Asyab.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.khaama.com/president-ghani-kabuls-ring-road-important-economical-project-3768 |title=President Ghani: Kabul's ring road important economical project |newspaper=The Khaama Press News Agency |date=16 August 2015 |access-date=25 January 2018 |archive-date=25 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125193632/https://www.khaama.com/president-ghani-kabuls-ring-road-important-economical-project-3768 |url-status=live |last1=Moosakhail |first1=Zabihullah}}</ref> A new bus [[public transport]] service was also planned to be opened in 2018 (see below).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kbr.id/english/07-2017/amid_chaos__kabul_gears_up_for_pioneering_metro_bus_service/91148.html |title=Amid chaos, Kabul gears up for pioneering metro bus service |date=17 July 2017 |access-date=20 January 2018 |archive-date=20 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120124448/http://kbr.id/english/07-2017/amid_chaos__kabul_gears_up_for_pioneering_metro_bus_service/91148.html |url-status=live}}</ref> In September 2017, the head of the Kabul Municipality announced that 286 meters of pedestrian overpass [[footbridge]]s will be built in eight busy areas "in the near future".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://khabarnama.net/blog/2017/09/17/building-fly-overs-in-kabul/ |title=در پایتخت؛ شهرداری کابل و ساخت 286 متر پُل هوایی در 8 موقعیت مزدحم شهر &#124; |date=17 September 2017 |access-date=25 January 2018 |archive-date=26 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126012822/http://khabarnama.net/blog/2017/09/17/building-fly-overs-in-kabul/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

Bicycles on the road were a common sight in the city.

===Public transport===
The [[taxicab]]s in Kabul were painted in a white and yellow livery. The majority of these were older model Toyota Corollas. A few Soviet-era Russian cabs were also still in operation.

Long-distance road journeys were made by private [[Mercedes-Benz buses|Mercedes-Benz coach buses]] or vans, trucks and cars. Although a nationwide bus service was available from Kabul, flying was safer, especially for foreigners. The city's public bus service ([[Milli Bus]] / "National Bus") was established in the 1960s to take [[commuters]] on daily routes to many destinations. The service had about 800 buses. The Kabul bus system had discovered a new source of revenue in whole-bus advertising from [[MTN Group|MTN]] similar to "bus wrap" advertising on public transit in more developed nations. There was also an express bus that runs from downtown to Hamid Karzai International Airport for [[Safi Airways]] passengers.

An electric [[trolleybus]] system operated in Kabul from February 1979 to 1992 using [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] fleet built by a [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] company (see [[Trolleybuses in Kabul]] for more). The trolleybus service was highly popular mainly due to its low price compared to the Millie Bus conventional bus service. The last trolleybus came to a halt in late 1992 due to warfare – much of the [[copper]] [[Overhead line|overhead wires]] were later looted but a few of them, including the steel poles, can still be seen in Kabul today.<ref name="spvd.cz" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://languages.oberlin.edu/blogs/relg270/catherine-lytle-from-gerbils-to-trolleybus/ |title=Catherine Lytle: From Gerbils to Trolleybus |access-date=8 January 2017 |archive-date=2 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200802213225/http://languages.oberlin.edu/blogs/relg270/catherine-lytle-from-gerbils-to-trolleybus/ |url-status=dead}}</ref>
