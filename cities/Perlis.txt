Perlis experiences a [[tropical monsoon climate]]. Much of the state's highlands are part of the [[Nakawan Range]], a subrange of the [[Tenasserim Hills]] system that spans through southern [[Myanmar]], [[Southern Thailand]] and the [[Peninsular Malaysia]], with Mount Perlis as the highest point at 733&nbsp;m. The Nakawan also forms a natural frontier between Perlis and [[Thailand]].

The capital of Perlis is [[Kangar]], and the royal capital is [[Arau]]. Another important town is [[Padang Besar, Malaysia|Padang Besar]], at the Malaysia–Thailand border and Kuala Perlis, the ferry town to Langkawi. The main port and ferry terminal is at the small village of [[Kuala Perlis]], linking mostly to [[Langkawi Island]].

Perlis has a snake sanctuary and research centre at Sungai Batu Pahat. Perlis State Park and Gua Kelam are among the popular tourist attractions.

==Etymology==
The origin of the toponym 'Perlis' is vague. However, there are several theories:
* According to a Malaysian historian, Mohd Yusuf bin Adil, the name comes from the [[Thai language|Thai]] phrase ''"phrao loi"'' ([[Southern Thai language|Southern Thai]]: พร้าวลอย) which means ''kelapa hanyut'' ([[coconut]] washed ashore) since there were many coconuts found on the shores of [[Kuala Perlis]]. The phrase has been shortened by locals until it sounded like ''"pereleh"'' or Perlis.
* It has also been suggested Perlis may be a shortened form of a [[Malay language|Malay]] word ''"peroleh"'' (obtain) as the state was a "gift" from [[Kedah]], since it was a part of Kedah before becoming a state on its own.
* According to ''Negeri Perlis Indera Kayangan: Sejarah Pembentukan Sebuah Negeri Berdaulat'' by Ahmad Ismail, the name comes from a tree of the same name, which may have gone extinct.
* Some researches suggests the name is derived from a northern Malay dialect word ''"perelus"'' which roughly translates as "foot falling into a crack", since Perlis is said to have a wide land filled with mud, and the people's feet may sink into the mud.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Perlis: Dari Jajahan Takluk Ke Negeri Berdaulat|last=Yazid Mat|first=Dato’}}</ref> 
* Additional suggestions include being named after someone, or derived from the French word ''"[[perlite]]"'' which means "rock" due to a huge rock near Sungai Perlis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://says.com/my/lifestyle/the-origins-of-state-names-in-malaysia|title=The Stories And Facts Behind How The 13 States Of Malaysia Got Their Names|last=Ruxyn|first=Tang|date=2017-04-26|website=SAYS.com|language=en|access-date=2019-02-05}}</ref>

The honorific "Indera Kayangan" was given by Tuanku Raja Syed Hussin Jamalullail (who ruled Perlis from 1843 to 1873) after the royal town of Indera Kayangan II (1797 until 1813) he was raised in now located in Kampung Langgar, Kayang within the [[Kuala Perlis]] area.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://melayu.library.uitm.edu.my/3473/1/SyedSirajuddinPutraJamalullail.pdf|title=Syed Sirajuddin Putra Jamalullail|publisher=Kerajaan Negeri Perlis & Perbadanan Perpustakaan Awam Negeri Perlis|year=2001|isbn=983-99768-2-6|location=Kangar, Perlis|pages=18, 20}}</ref> However, this epithet became less popular under the recommendation of [[Sirajuddin of Perlis|Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin Putra Jamalullail]] in 2015, in which according to him is inline with the official singular name given in the state constitution his father signed without any long epithets in general "which is related to [[Indra|deities]], or any 'Darul'..."".<ref name="TheStar"/>

==History==

Perlis was originally part of [[Kedah]], although it occasionally came under the rule of [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] or [[Aceh Sultanate|Aceh]]. Perlis was historically an important realm within the Kingdom of Kedah. Sultan Muhyiddin of Kedah made his capital in Kota Sena, while Sultan Dhiauddin II made Kota Indera Kayangan his capital.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://perlisroyalty.perlis.gov.my/index.php/ms/sejarah/pusat-pentadbiran|title=Pusat Pentadbiran|access-date=3 April 2018|archive-date=29 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211229043331/https://perlisroyalty.perlis.gov.my/index.php/ms/sejarah/pusat-pentadbiran|url-status=dead}}</ref> Sultan Dhiauddin II of Kedah was honorifically titled as Raja Muda of Perlis and Kedah,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sejarah: Tempat Bersemayam|url=https://perlisroyalty.perlis.gov.my/index.php/ms/sejarah/tempat-bersemayam|url-status=dead|access-date=18 May 2021|website=Raja Perlis|archive-date=29 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211229043428/https://perlisroyalty.perlis.gov.my/index.php/ms/sejarah/tempat-bersemayam}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://hids.arkib.gov.my/-/perjanjian-inggeris-dengan-sultan-kedah?searchGoBack=true&keyword=perlis |title=Hari Ini Dalam Sejarah |website=hids.arkib.gov.my |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425031832/http://hids.arkib.gov.my/-/perjanjian-inggeris-dengan-sultan-kedah?searchGoBack=true&keyword=perlis |archive-date=2018-04-25}}</ref> akin to the title [[Prince of Wales]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

In the [[Burney Treaty]], the exiled Sultan of Kedah, [[Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah II|Ahmad Tajuddin]] was not restored to his throne.

In 1842, the Sultan agreed to accept Siamese terms and was restored to the throne of Kedah. However, Siam separated Perlis into a separate principality which was a direct vassal of [[Bangkok]]. The Siamese made Raja Long Krok as the Governor of Siam in Perlis while Syed (or Sayyid) Hussain Jamalullail as deputy governor. On 20 May 1843, the [[Siam]]ese made [[House of Jamalullail (Perlis)|Sayyid Hussain Jamalulail]], the paternal grandson of a [[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]] [[Arab]] [[Sayyid]] immigrant and maternal grandson of the Sultan of Kedah, the first [[Raja]] of Perlis<ref>{{cite book|title=Power Hadhrami Traders, Scholars, and Statesmen in the Indian Ocean, 1750s–1960s

In 1897, Kedah led by its prime minister, Wan Mat Saman began efforts to end the sovereignty of Perlis (similar to the [[Kingdom of Kubang Pasu Darul Qiyam|Kingdom of Kubang Pasu]] which was absorbed into Kedah). After several tense occasions and disputes, the Siamese king [[Chulalongkorn]] sided with Perlis.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.arkib.gov.my/documents/10157/34f25242-cc92-4bb1-85d1-b518199dbde0|title= Dato' Yazid Mat, Page 8|access-date= 14 April 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180414034946/http://www.arkib.gov.my/documents/10157/34f25242-cc92-4bb1-85d1-b518199dbde0|archive-date= 14 April 2018|url-status= dead}}</ref> Perlis also had several disputes with the state of [[Setul]] before the 1900s.

As with Kedah, the [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909]] forced Siam to relinquish its southern Malay vassal states of [[Kelantan]], [[Trengganu]], and Monthon Syburi (comprising [[Kedah]], Perlis, and [[Satun Province|Satun]] (but Satun remained with Thailand)) to Great Britain. The British installed a [[British Resident|Resident]] in the Perlis royal capital of [[Arau]]. Perlis was returned to Siam in [[World War II]] as a reward for Siam's alliance with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], but this brief annexation ended with the Japanese surrender. After World War II, Perlis returned to British rule until it became part of the [[Malayan Union]], then the [[Federation of Malaya]] in 1957, and lastly, [[Malaysia]] in 1963.

Since 2000, the raja has been [[Sirajuddin of Perlis|Sirajuddin]]. He was the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] (King of Malaysia) from 13 December 2001 to 12 December 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.majlisraja-raja.gov.my/index.php/bm/maklumat-perkhidmatan/senarai-yang-di-pertuan-agong|title=Pejabat Penyimpan Mohor Besar Raja-Raja - Senarai Yang di-Pertuan Agong|website=Majlisraja-raja.gov.my|access-date=25 November 2017|archive-date=7 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707091013/http://www.majlisraja-raja.gov.my/index.php/bm/maklumat-perkhidmatan/senarai-yang-di-pertuan-agong|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Tuanku Syed Faizuddin Putra]] was the Regent of Perlis during the five-year period when Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin was Yang di-Pertuan Agong.

==Geography==

[[File:Limestone formations in Perlis.jpg|thumb|Bukit Chabang, a landmark [[twin-peaked]] [[mogote]] towering over [[paddy field]] squares]]
Perlis is the smallest state in Malaysia, covering a total land area of 819&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Like other [[Peninsular Malaysia#Other features|west coast states]], it has a coastline facing the [[Strait of Malacca]], measuring around 20.4&nbsp;km (12.7&nbsp;mi) from [[Kuala Sanglang]] at the border with [[Kedah]]'s [[Kubang Pasu District]] up north towards the [[Malaysia-Thailand border]] near Pos Batu Putih, in the vicinity of [[Kuala Perlis]].

From south to north, its topographical profile consists of flat, arable lands of the Kedah–Perlis Plain dotted with numerous [[Mogote|mogotes]], and abruptly rises up high as rolling [[karstic]] hills of the [[Nakawan Range]], which forms the natural boundary between the state and the province of [[Satun province|Satun]] on the [[Thailand|Thai]] side. In general, [[paddy fields]] dominate much of the state's landscape as the Perlisian portion of the Kedah–Perlis Plain had been utilized for [[rice farming]] since antiquity. Meanwhile, the [[Nakawan Range|Nakawan]] runs southwest–northeast along the Thai border from [[Kuala Perlis]] towards [[Kaki Bukit]]. The range is home to the 733-metre tall Mount Perlis, the highest point in the state.

===Climate===
Along with northern [[Kedah]], the entirety of Perlis experiences [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: '''''Am''''').

Perlis is ruled by the [[House of Jamalullail (Perlis)|House of Jamalullail]]. Unlike most other [[Malay states]], in which the ruler is a "sultan", the ruler of Perlis is called the "raja".<ref>{{cite book|last=Ooi Keat Gin|title=Historical Dictionary of Malaysia|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=252}}</ref>

Legislative power in the state is exercised by the [[Perlis State Legislative Assembly]], a unicameral chamber in which all 15 seats are elected from single-member constituencies. After the [[Results of the Malaysian general election, 2022 by state constituency|2022 state election]], the [[Perikatan Nasional]] coalition, led by the [[Malaysian Islamic Party]], holds 14 of the assembly's 15 seats.

The raja appoints [[menteri besar]] (chief minister) and an Executive Council (akin to a Cabinet). Generally, the chief minister is a member of the legislative assembly who can command a majority on the assembly's floor. The raja's appointment powers were at the centre of a brief constitutional crisis in the state after the [[2008 Malaysian general election|2008 general election]]. The Raja sought to appoint a Barisan Nasional assemblyman, [[Md Isa Sabu]], as chief minister despite Prime Minister [[Abdullah Badawi]], who led the national coalition, nominating the incumbent [[Shahidan Kassim]] to continue in office. The Raja prevailed, and swore in Md Isa, who proceeded to serve a full term as chief minister.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/story/?file=%2f2008%2f3%2f15%2fnation%2f20658063&sec=nation|title=Palaces intervene in appointment of two MBs|date=15 March 2008|work=The Star|access-date=5 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629201542/http://www.thestar.com.my/story/?file=%2f2008%2f3%2f15%2fnation%2f20658063&sec=nation|archive-date=29 June 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The state elects three members of the federal [[Dewan Rakyat|House of Representatives]], for the constituencies of [[Arau]], [[Kangar]] and [[Padang Besar, Malaysia|Padang Besar]]. All three seats have been held by the Perikatan Nasional since the [[Perlis state election, 2022|2022 general elections]].

The state also has two [[Dewan Negara|federal senators]]; like all other states, the senators are not directly elected but appointed by a vote of the state legislative assembly.

Perlis, being the smallest state by area in Malaysia, is not divided into administrative districts. It is, however, still divided into 22 [[mukim]]s (communes), namely:

===Languages===
Majority of Perlis' population speaks [[Kedah Malay|Perlis Malay]] which is a sub-dialect of Kedah Malay but has its own unique features compared to those of neighbouring Kedah. Perlisian Chinese people are mostly [[Hokkien]] by ancestry and speak a dialect of [[Penang Hokkien|Hokkien]]. Besides that there is also [[Hokkien]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[English language|English]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Malayalam]] as well as small numbers of [[Southern Thai language|Southern Thai]] speakers, mostly ethnic [[Malaysian Siamese]]. However, large numbers of Perlisians regardless of ethnic origin mainly uses Perlis Malay as a [[lingua franca]]. In particular, Perlis is well known for its distinctive [[Hokkien]] language, known as [[Penang Hokkien]]. [[Hokkien]] serves as the lingua franca among the various ethnic Chinese communities in Perlis. Perlis Chinese are predominantly [[Hokkien]] and thus mostly speak [[Penang Hokkien|Hokkien]] as their [[first language]].
