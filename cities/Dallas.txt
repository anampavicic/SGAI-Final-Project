Dallas and nearby [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] were initially developed as a product of the construction of major railroad lines through the area allowing access to [[cotton]], [[cattle]], and later [[Petroleum|oil]] in North and [[East Texas]].

The [[Praetorian Building]] in Dallas of 15 stories, built in 1909, was among the first [[skyscrapers]] west of [[Mississippi River|the Mississippi]] and the tallest building in Texas for some time.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dallas' Tallest|url=https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/1996/october/dallas-tallest/|access-date=September 16, 2020|website=D Magazine|date=October 1996 |language=en}}</ref> It marked the prominence of Dallas as a city. A racetrack for [[thoroughbred]]s was built and their owners established the Dallas Jockey Club. Trotters raced at a track in Fort Worth, where a similar drivers club was based. The rapid expansion of population increased competition for jobs and housing.

In 1910, a white mob of hundreds of people [[Lynching|lynched]] a black man, [[Lynching of Allen Brooks|Allen Brooks]], accused of raping a little girl.

{{Main|Geology of the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex}}
Dallas and its surrounding area are mostly flat. The city lies at elevations ranging from {{convert|450|to|550|ft|m|0}} above sea level. The western edge of the Austin Chalk Formation, a [[limestone]] [[escarpment]] (also known as the "White Rock Escarpment"), rises {{convert|230|ft|m|0}} and runs roughly north–south through Dallas County. South of the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]], the uplift is particularly noticeable in the neighborhoods of Oak Cliff and the adjacent cities of Cockrell Hill, [[Cedar Hill, Texas|Cedar Hill]], [[Grand Prairie, Texas|Grand Prairie]], and [[Irving, Texas|Irving]]. Marked variations in terrain are also found in cities immediately to the west in [[Tarrant County, Texas|Tarrant County]] surrounding Fort Worth, as well as along Turtle Creek north of Downtown.

Dallas, like many other cities, was founded along a river. The city was founded at the location of a "white rock crossing" of the Trinity River, where it was easier for wagons to cross the river in the days before ferries or bridges. The Trinity River, though not usefully navigable, is the major waterway through the city. [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|Interstate 35E]] parallels its path through Dallas along the [[Stemmons Corridor]], then south alongside the western portion of Downtown and past South Dallas and Pleasant Grove, where the river is paralleled by [[Interstate 45 (Texas)|Interstate 45]] until it exits the city and heads southeast towards [[Houston]]. The river is flanked on both sides by {{convert|50|ft|m|0}} tall earthen [[levee]]s to protect the city from frequent floods.<ref>{{cite web|author=John N.

Since it was rerouted in the late 1920s, the river has been little more than a [[drainage ditch]] within a floodplain for several miles above and below Downtown, with a more normal course further upstream and downstream, but as Dallas began shifting towards postindustrial society, public outcry about the lack of aesthetic and recreational use of the river ultimately gave way to the [[Trinity River Project]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Discover The Trinity-Dallas |work=Discover The Trinity |publisher=Discoverthetrinity.org |access-date=September 12, 2009 |url=http://www.discoverthetrinity.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925092304/http://www.discoverthetrinity.org/ |archive-date=September 25, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> which was begun in the early 2000s.

The project area reaches for over {{convert|20|mi|km}} in length within the city, while the overall geographical land area addressed by the Land Use Plan is approximately {{convert|44000|acre|km2}} in size—about 20% of the land area in Dallas.

[[White Rock Lake]] and [[Joe Pool Lake]] are reservoirs that comprise Dallas's other significant water features. Built at the beginning of the 20th century, White Rock Lake Park is a popular destination for boaters, rowers, joggers, and bikers, as well as visitors seeking peaceful respite from the city at the {{convert|66|acre|m2|-3|adj=on}} [[Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden]], on the lake's eastern shore. [[White Rock Creek]] feeds into White Rock Lake and then exits into the Trinity River southeast of Downtown Dallas. Trails along White Rock Creek are part of the extensive Dallas County Trails System.

[[Bachman Lake]], just northwest of [[Dallas Love Field|Love Field Airport]], is a smaller lake also popularly used for recreation. Northeast of the city is [[Lake Ray Hubbard]], a vast {{convert|22745|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} reservoir in an extension of Dallas surrounded by the suburbs of [[Garland, Texas|Garland]], [[Rowlett, Texas|Rowlett]], [[Rockwall, Texas|Rockwall]], and [[Sunnyvale, Texas|Sunnyvale]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Bobby Farquhar and Mark McDonald |title=Lake Ray Hubbard |url=http://www.rtis.com/reg/lakes/rayhubba.htm |work=Set the Hook Guide to Lone Star Lakes and Lunkers |access-date=August 5, 2009 |archive-date=June 6, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606090611/http://www.rtis.com/reg/lakes/rayhubba.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> To the west of the city is [[Mountain Creek Lake]], once home to the [[Naval Air Station Dallas]] ([[Hensley Field]]) and a number of defense aircraft manufacturers.<ref>{{cite gnis|1342165|Mountain Creek Lake|Jan 10, 2024}}</ref><ref name="handbook">{{Handbook of Texas|id=qbn02|name=Naval Air Station, Dallas}}</ref>

Dallas has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Cfa'', [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Cfhk'') characteristic of the [[Great Plains|Southern Plains]] of the United States. It also has both continental and tropical characteristics, characterized by a relatively wide annual temperature range for the latitude. Located at the lower end of [[Tornado Alley]], it is prone to extreme weather, tornadoes, and hailstorms.

Summers in Dallas are very hot with high humidity, although extended periods of dry weather often occur. July and August are typically the hottest months, with an average high of {{convert|96.0|°F|°C|0|lk=on}} and an average low of {{convert|76.7|°F|°C|0}}. Heat indices regularly surpass {{convert|105|°F|°C|0}} due to elevated humidity during the summer months, making the summer heat almost unbearable. The all-time record high is {{convert|113|°F|0}}, set on June 26 and 27, 1980 during the [[Heat Wave of 1980]] at nearby [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]].<ref name="NOAA Online" /><ref name="NWS Records">{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/fwd/?n=dgr8mxmn|title=Dallas/Fort Worth – All-Time Maximum and Minimum Temperatures|publisher=National Weather Service Fort Worth|access-date=December 5, 2011}}</ref>

Winters in Dallas are usually mild, with occasional cold spells.

Spring and autumn are transitional seasons with moderate and pleasant weather.

Late spring to early summer also tends to be the most humid, with humidity levels frequently exceeding 75%. The weather in Dallas is also generally pleasant from late September to early December and on many winter days. Autumn often brings more storms and tornado threats, but they are usually fewer and less severe than in spring.

Each spring, cold fronts moving south from the North collide with warm, humid air streaming in from the [[Gulf Coast]], leading to severe [[thunderstorm]]s with [[lightning]], torrents of rain, [[hail]], and occasionally, [[tornado]]es. Over time, tornadoes have probably been the most significant natural threat to the city, as it is near the heart of [[Tornado Alley]].

A few times each winter in Dallas, warm and humid air from the south will override cold, dry air, resulting in [[freezing rain]] or ice and causing disruptions in the city if the roads and highways become slick. Temperatures reaching {{convert|70|°F|0}} on average occur on at least four days each winter month. Dallas averages 26 annual nights at or below freezing,<ref name="NOAA Online">{{cite web|url = https://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=fwd|title = NowData – NOAA Online Weather Data|publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|access-date = November 30, 2012}}</ref> with the winter of 1999–2000 holding the record for the fewest freezing nights with 14.

===Crime===

According to the FBI, a city to city comparison of crime rates can be misleading, because recording practices vary from city to city, citizens report different percentages of crimes from one city to the next, and the actual number of people physically present in a city is unknown.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/06prelim/ |title=Preliminary Annual Uniform Crime Report, January–December, 2006 |publisher=Fbi.gov |date=June 4, 2007 |access-date=May 23, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114195803/http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/06prelim/ |archive-date=January 14, 2010}}</ref> With that in mind, Dallas has one of the top 10 crime rates in Texas and its crime rate is higher than the national average.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://kqvt.com/1-violent-texas-city/ |last1=pooks |website=Q92 | title=Here is the #1 Most Violent City in the Entire State of Texas | date=September 2, 2023 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Dallas-Fort Worth, TX, Crime Rate & Safety |url=https://realestate.usnews.com/places/texas/dallas-fort-worth/crime |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240225025950/https://realestate.usnews.com/places/texas/dallas-fort-worth/crime |archive-date=2024-02-25 |website=U.S. News}}</ref>

In its beginnings, Dallas relied on farming, neighboring [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]'s [[Fort Worth Stockyards|Stockyards]], and its prime location on Native American trade routes to sustain itself. Dallas' key to growth came in 1873 with the construction of multiple [[Rail road|rail]] lines through the city. As Dallas grew and technology developed, cotton became its boon and by 1900, Dallas was the largest inland cotton market in the world, becoming a leader in [[cotton gin]] machinery manufacturing.

By the early 1900s, Dallas was a hub for economic activity all over the Southern United States and was selected in 1914 as the seat of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas|Eleventh Federal Reserve District]]. By 1925, Texas churned out more than {{frac|1|3}} of the nation's cotton crop, with 31% of Texas cotton produced within a {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} [[radius]] of Dallas. In the 1930s, petroleum was discovered east of Dallas, near [[Kilgore, Texas|Kilgore]]. Dallas' proximity to the discovery put it immediately at the center of the nation's petroleum market. Petroleum discoveries in the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]], the [[Texas Panhandle|Panhandle]], the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]], and [[Oklahoma]] in the following years further solidified Dallas' position as the hub of the market.<ref name="paynechapV">{{cite book|last=Payne |first=Darwin |title= Dallas, an illustrated history |year=1982 |publisher=Windsor Publications |location=Woodland Hills, California |isbn= 0-89781-034-1 |pages=189–221 |chapter= Chapter VII: The Emergence of "Big D"}}</ref>

The end of [[World War II]] left Dallas seeded with a nexus of communications, engineering, and production talent by companies such as Collins Radio Corporation. Decades later, the telecommunications and information revolutions still drive a large portion of the local economy. The city is sometimes referred to as the heart of "[[Silicon Prairie]]" because of a high concentration of telecommunications companies in the region, the epicenter of which lies along the [[Telecom Corridor]] in [[Richardson, Texas|Richardson]], a northern suburb of Dallas. The Telecom Corridor is home to more than 5,700 companies including [[Texas Instruments]] (headquartered in Dallas), [[Nortel Networks]], [[Alcatel Lucent]], [[AT&T Inc.|AT&T]], [[Ericsson]], [[Fujitsu]], [[Nokia]], [[Rockwell Collins]], [[Cisco Systems]], [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]], [[Verizon Communications]], and [[CompUSA]] (which is now headquartered in [[Miami]], [[Florida]]).<ref>[http://www.telecomcorridor.com/ Telecom Corridor website].

In the 1980s Dallas was a real estate hotbed, with the increasing metropolitan population bringing with it a demand for new housing and office space. Several of [[Downtown Dallas]]' largest buildings are the fruit of this boom, but over-speculation, the [[savings and loan crisis]] and an oil bust brought the 1980s building boom to an end for Dallas as well as its sister city Houston. Between the late 1980s and the early 2000s, central Dallas went through a slow period of growth. However, since the early 2000s the central core of Dallas has been enjoying steady and significant growth encompassing both repurposing of older commercial buildings in Downtown Dallas into residential and hotel uses, as well as the construction of new office and residential towers. The opening of [[Klyde Warren Park]], built across [[Texas State Highway Spur 366|Woodall Rodgers Freeway]] seamlessly connecting the central Dallas CBD to Uptown/Victory Park, has acted synergistically with the highly successful Dallas Arts District, so both have become catalysts for significant new development in central Dallas.

The residential real estate market in the [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex]] has not only been resilient but has once again returned to a boom status. Dallas and the greater metro area have been leading the nation in apartment construction and net leasing, with rents reaching all-time highs. Single family home sales, whether pre-owned or new construction, along with home price appreciation, were leading the nation since 2015.<ref name="Economic Snapshot">{{cite news|title=DFW Apartment Boom Hits Region|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2015/07/01/dfw-apartment-boom-hits-region-with-all-time.html|newspaper=Dallas Business Journal|access-date=July 1, 2015}}</ref><ref name="Dallas Residential Real Estate">{{cite news | title = Dallas Area Home Price Growth Dwarfs National Gains | url = https://www.dallasnews.com/business/residential-real-estate/20150630-dallas-area-home-price-growth-dwarfs-national-gains.ece | first = Steve | last = Brown | newspaper = [[The Dallas Morning News]] | date = June 30, 2015 | access-date = June 30, 2015 | archive-date = July 7, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150707010853/http://www.dallasnews.com/business/residential-real-estate/20150630-dallas-area-home-price-growth-dwarfs-national-gains.ece | url-status = dead }}</ref>

A sudden drop in the price of oil, starting in mid-2014 and accelerating throughout 2015, has not significantly affected Dallas and its greater metro area due to the highly diversified nature of its economy. Dallas and the metropolitan region continue to see strong demand for housing, apartment and office leasing, shopping center space, warehouse and industrial space with overall job growth remaining very robust. Oil-dependent cities and regions have felt significant effects from the downturn, but Dallas's growth has continued unabated, strengthening in 2015. Significant national headquarters relocations to the area (as exemplified by Toyota's decision to leave [[California]] and establish its new North American headquarters in the Dallas area) coupled with significant expansions of regional offices for a variety of corporations and along with company relocations to Downtown Dallas helped drive the boom in the Dallas economy.

The Dallas–Fort Worth area has one of the largest concentrations of corporate headquarters for publicly traded companies in the United States. ''Fortune Magazine''{{'s}} 2022 annual list of the Fortune 500 in America indicates the city of Dallas had 11 Fortune 500 companies,.<ref name="Fortune-2022" /> and the DFW region as a whole had 23.<ref name="Fortune-2022a" /> As of 2022, Dallas–Fort Worth represents the second-largest concentration of Fortune 500 headquarters in Texas and fourth-largest in the United States, behind the metropolitan areas of [[Greater Houston|Houston]] (24), [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicago]] (35) and [[New York metropolitan area|New York]] (62).<ref name="Fortune-2022a" />

{{Main|Transportation in Dallas}}

Like many other major cities in the United States, the automobile is the primary mode of local transportation, though efforts have been made to increase the availability of alternative modes of transportation, including the construction of light rail lines, biking and walking paths, wide sidewalks, a trolley system, and buses. [[Walk Score]] ranked Dallas the twenty-third most walkable of fifty largest cities in the United States in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walkscore.com/rankings/cities/|title=2011 City and Neighborhood Rankings |publisher=Walk Score |year=2011 |access-date=August 28, 2011}}</ref>

In 2009, 78.5% of Dallas (city) commuters drive to work alone. The 2009 [[modal share|mode share]] for Dallas (city) commuters are 10.7% for carpooling, 3.9% for transit, 1.9% for walking, and .1% for cycling.<ref>{{cite web|author=Yonah Freemark|url=https://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2010/10/13/transit-mode-share-trends-looking-steady-rail-appears-to-encourage-non-automobile-commutes/|access-date=October 31, 2017|date= October 13, 2010|title=Transit Mode Share Trends Looking Steady; Rail Appears to Encourage Non-Automobile Commutes|website=Transport Politic}}</ref> In 2015, the American Community Survey estimated modal shares for Dallas (city) commuters of 75.4% for driving alone, 12.8% for carpooling, 3.5% for riding transit, 1.9% for walking, and .2% for cycling.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|series=American Fact Finder|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=October 31, 2017|title=2015 American Community Survey, 1-year estimates: Commuting Characteristics by Sex}}</ref>

The city of Dallas has a higher than average percentage of households without a car. In 2015, 10.2 percent of Dallas households lacked a car, and decreased to 9.1 percent in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Dallas averaged 1.59 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Car Ownership in U.S. Cities Data and Map|journal=Governing|date=December 9, 2014|url=http://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html|access-date=May 4, 2018}}</ref>

===Highways===
Dallas is at the confluence of four major [[interstate highway system|interstate highways]]—Interstates [[Interstate 20 in Texas|20]], [[Interstate 30|30]], [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|35E]], and [[Interstate 45|45]]. The Dallas area freeway system is set up in the popular [[Spoke-hub distribution paradigm|hub-and-spoke]] system, shaped much like a wagon wheel. Starting from the center of the city, a small freeway loop surrounds Downtown, followed by the [[Interstate 635 (Texas)|I-635]] loop about {{convert|10|mi|0}} outside Downtown, and ultimately the tolled [[President George Bush Turnpike]].

Inside these freeway loops are other [[boulevard]]- and [[parkway]]-style loops, including [[Texas State Highway Loop 12|Loop 12]] and [[Belt Line Road (Texas)|Belt Line Road]]. Another beltway around the city upwards of {{convert|45|mi|km|0}} from Downtown is under plan in Collin County.

Radiating out of Downtown Dallas' freeway loop are the spokes of the area's highway system—Interstates 30, 35E, and 45, [[U.S. Route 75 in Texas|US 75]], [[U.S. Route 77 in Texas|US 77]], [[U.S. Route 175|US 175]], [[Texas State Highway Spur 366|SH Spur 366]], the [[Dallas North Tollway]], [[Texas State Highway 114|SH 114]], [[U.S. Route 80 in Texas|US 80]], and [[U.S. Route 67 in Texas|US 67]]. Other major highways around the city include [[Texas State Highway 183|SH 183]] and [[Texas State Highway Spur 408|Spur 408]].

The recently completed interchange at the intersection of Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway ([[Interstate 635 (Texas)|I-635]]) and the [[Central Expressway (Dallas)|Central Expressway]] (US 75) has five stacks and is aptly called the [[High Five Interchange]]. It is one of the few five-level interchanges in Dallas and is one of the largest freeway interchanges in the United States.

The following is a list of the freeways and tollways in the Dallas-Fort Worth area:

===Airports===
[[File:DFWAirportOverview.jpg|thumb|In 2020, [[Dallas Fort Worth International Airport]] was the busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cntraveler.com/story/how-dallas-forth-worth-became-the-busiest-airport-in-the-world|title=The Pandemic Has Made This Airport the World's Busiest|date=July 30, 2020|website=Condé Nast Traveler}}</ref>]]
Two commercial airports serve Dallas: [[Dallas Fort Worth International Airport]] and [[Dallas Love Field]]. In addition, [[Dallas Executive Airport]] (formerly Redbird Airport), serves as a [[general aviation]] airport for the city, and [[Addison Airport]] functions similarly just outside the city limits in the suburb of Addison. Two more general aviation airports are about {{convert|35|mi|0}} north of Dallas in [[McKinney, Texas|McKinney]], and another two are in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], on the west side of the metroplex. [[Fort Worth Alliance Airport|Alliance Airport]], in far North Fort Worth, is a cargo reliever airport to DFW Airport and general aviation facility.

DFW Airport is in the suburbs slightly north of and equidistant to Downtown Fort Worth and Downtown Dallas. In terms of size, DFW International is the largest airport in the state, the second largest in the United States, and ninth largest in the world; DFW International Airport is larger than the island of [[Manhattan]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=DIA is the second biggest airport in the world, and that means it's bigger than Manhattan|url=https://www.9news.com/article/travel/denver-international-airport/how-big-is-dia-denver-airport/73-01b2cee0-03c4-4317-9e55-dd0537cf2239|access-date=June 29, 2020|website=KUSA.com|date=February 21, 2020 |language=en-US}}</ref>

In terms of traffic, DFW Airport is the [[List of airports in Texas#Busiest Texan airports|busiest airport in the state]], [[List of the busiest airports in the United States|fourth-busiest in the United States]], and [[List of the busiest airports|eleventh-busiest in the world]]. The headquarters of [[American Airlines]], the largest air carrier in the world ahead of [[United Airlines]] and [[Delta Air Lines]], is less than {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} from DFW Airport within Fort Worth's city limits. Similarly, Love Field is within Dallas's city limits, about {{convert|6|mi|0}} northwest of Downtown, and is headquarters to [[Southwest Airlines]], the largest domestic airline in the United States.

[[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]] (DART) is the Dallas-area public transportation authority that provides rail, buses and [[HOV]] lanes to commuters. DART began operating the first [[light rail]] system in Texas in 1996, and it is now the largest operator of light rail in the US.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://irvingblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2010/12/dart-becomes-nations-largest-l.html |title=DART becomes nation's largest light rail system today &#124; Irving Blog |publisher=Irvingblog.dallasnews.com |date=December 6, 2010 |access-date=May 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323110609/http://irvingblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2010/12/dart-becomes-nations-largest-l.html |archive-date=March 23, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Today, the system is the [[List of United States light rail systems by ridership|seventh-busiest]] light rail system in the country with approximately 55 stations on {{convert|72|mi}} of light rail, and 10 stations on {{convert|35|mi}} of commuter rail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dart.org/about/expansion/otherprojects.asp|title=DART.org – Expansion Information|website=dart.org|access-date=August 27, 2017}}</ref> It includes four light rail lines and a commuter line: the {{DART R}}, the {{DART B}}, the {{DART G}}, the {{DART O}}, and the {{DART TRE}}.

The {{DART R}} travels through [[Oak Cliff]], [[South Dallas]], [[downtown Dallas|Downtown]], [[Uptown Dallas|Uptown]], [[North Dallas]], [[Richardson, Texas|Richardson]] and [[Plano, Texas|Plano]], while the {{DART B}} goes through Oak Cliff, Downtown, Uptown, [[East Dallas]], [[Lake Highlands]], and [[Garland, Texas|Garland]]. The {{DART R|style=nl}} and {{DART B|style=nl}} lines are conjoined between [[8th & Corinth Station]] in Oak Cliff through [[Mockingbird Station]] in [[North Dallas]]. The two lines service [[Cityplace Station]]. The Green Line serves [[Carrollton, Texas|Carrollton]], [[Farmers Branch, Texas|Farmers Branch]], [[Dallas Love Field|Love Field Airport]], [[Stemmons Corridor, Dallas, Texas|Stemmons Corridor]], [[Victory Park, Dallas, Texas|Victory Park]], Downtown, [[Deep Ellum, Dallas, Texas|Deep Ellum]], [[Fair Park]], South Dallas, and [[Pleasant Grove, Dallas|Pleasant Grove]].

The Orange Line initially operated as a peak-service line providing extra capacity on portions of the Green and Red Lines ([[Bachman Station]] on the Green Line, through the Downtown transit mall, to [[Parker Road Station]] on the Red Line making a "U"-shape). However, the first stage of the Orange Line opened on December 6, 2010, extending its west end from Bachman to [[Belt Line Station]] in Irving. The second and final phase opened in August 2014 and provided [[Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport|DFW Airport]] with rail service. [[DFW Airport Terminal A station]] is the terminus for the Orange Line and connects [[DFW Skylink|Skylink]].<ref name="dart.org">{{cite web|url=http://dart.org/about/expansion/orangeline.asp |title=Orange Line Expansion Information |publisher=DART.org |access-date=May 11, 2013}}</ref>

This provides passengers the convenience of disembarking the DART rail, proceeding to security check-in and immediately boarding [[DFW Skylink|Skylink]] to be quickly transported to their desired terminal. The Blue Line has also been extended by {{convert|4.5|mi}} to serve [[Rowlett, Texas|Rowlett]] at the [[Rowlett Park & Ride]] facility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dart.org/about/expansion/blueline.asp |title=Blue Line Expansion Information |publisher=DART.org |access-date=May 11, 2013}}</ref>

In August 2009, the Regional Transportation Council agreed to seek $96&nbsp;million in federal stimulus dollars for a trolley project in Dallas and Fort Worth. The Oak Cliff Transit Authority took the lead with leaders envisioning a streetcar line that would link [[Dallas Union Station|Union Station]] and the [[Dallas Convention Center]] in Downtown to Oak Cliff, Methodist Medical Center, and the [[Bishop Arts District]] via the Houston Street Viaduct.<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://oakcliffblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2009/08/proposed-streetcar-route-for-o.html | title = Proposed streetcar route for Oak Cliff scaled back | first = Roy | last = Appleton | date = August 17, 2009 | newspaper = [[The Dallas Morning News]] | via = oakcliffblog.dallasnews.com | access-date = September 27, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110114202204/http://oakcliffblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2009/08/proposed-streetcar-route-for-o.html | archive-date = January 14, 2011}}</ref>

In addition to light rail, [[Amtrak]]'s ''[[Texas Eagle]]'' also serves Union Station, providing daily service east to [[Chicago]] and west to [[San Antonio station (Texas)|San Antonio]], and thrice-weekly service west to [[Los Angeles]]. The Trinity Rail Express terminates at Union Station and [[T&P Station]].
