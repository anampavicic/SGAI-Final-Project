'''Temerloh''' is a municipality in central [[Pahang]], Malaysia. Located about {{convert|130|km|mi}} from [[Kuala Lumpur]] along the [[Malaysia Federal Route 2|Kuantan–Kuala Lumpur trunk road]], Temerloh is the second largest urban area in [[Pahang]] after [[Kuantan]], the state capital city. It is situated at the [[confluence]] of the [[Pahang River|Pahang]] and [[Semantan River|Semantan Rivers]]. Today, ''Temerloh'' usually refers to the territory under the administration of Temerloh Municipal Council which includes [[Mentakab]], [[Lanchang]], Kuala Krau and [[Kerdau]].

An old town with some colonial buildings and [[shophouses]], the town has prospered in recent years as a transport hub and new industrial centre. There have been many new commercial and industrial hubs built in Temerloh in recent years. Cutting travel time in half, the [[East Coast Expressway]] links the town to [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Kuantan]] and adds to the growth of Temerloh.

==Etymology==
The town was once called Kuala Semantan as it is situated at the Semantan River's confluence. The later name ''Temerloh'' was derived from the [[Pahang Malay|Pahangite]] term {{Lang|ms|mereloh}} meaning "to sleep" or "to snore":<ref>{{Cite dictionary|url=https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-60272783/view?partId=nla.obj-436278129#page/n331/mode/1up/search/rSloh|title=rĕloh|dictionary=A Malay-English dictionary (romanised)|last=Wilkinson|first=Richard James|author-link=Richard James Wilkinson|publisher=Salavopoulos & Kinderlis|location=Mytilene|date=1932|volume=II|page=326}}</ref> it is said{{By whom|date=October 2021}} that ''Temerloh'' came about when a group of [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] settlers, who came there to settle, noticed an [[Orang Asli]] (aborigine) who slept ({{Lang|ms|mereloh}}) all day without a care in the world. Perhaps as a mark of amazement on such lazy conduct and perhaps for lack of other names, or probably just in jest, he then called the settlement ''Temerloh''. Another more plausible theory claims the town's name is derived from a local resting place of the same Orang Asli tribe there called ''tempat mereloh'', this would be contracted to ''temerloh'' easier on the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] settlers' tongues.

==Government==
'''Temerloh Municipal Council''' ({{lang-ms|Majlis Perbandaran Temerloh}}) is the local authority of the whole of Temerloh District including Temerloh town. From 1 July 1981 until 14 January 1997, Temerloh town was governed by the '''Temerloh District Council''' ({{lang-ms|Majlis Daerah Temerloh}}), which was formed through the merger of Temerloh and Mentakab Town Council and the Local Councils of Kuala Krau, Kerdau and Lanchang. Temerloh District Council was upgraded to the present-day Municipal Council on 15 January 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mpt.gov.my/ms/mpt/profil/latar-belakang|title=Background}}</ref>

==Climate==
Temerloh has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Af]]) with no distinct seasons. Temperatures remain hot year round with warm nights. Precipitation peaks during the months of October to December.<div style="width:82%;">

==History==
[[File:Old_Temerloh_bridge_damaged_in_1972_flood.JPG|thumb|Damaged Temerloh bridge during 1971/72 flood.]]
According to Haji Zakaria Hitam, the modern-day Temerloh developed from a small settlement called Kuala Semantan. Kuala Semantan was actually a small old village at the bank of Semantan River. According to the folk story, the name ''Semantan'' came from the words ''Seman Tahan''. Osman, or Seman Tahan as the villagers called him, is a [[Brunei]]an who settled at the small river connected to Pahang River. He mastered the martial art of [[silat]], thus many people came all the way and settled here to learn silat from him. As Seman Tahan became popular among the villagers, they named the river Seman Tahan River. Thus, the town near the river was called Kuala Seman Tahan ({{Lang|ms|kuala}} in Malay means 'river confluence'). The name Seman Tahan gradually became Semantan.

The Temerloh district, on the other hand was established on July 1, 1889, when J. P. Rodger, the first [[Resident (title)#Residents-general (and their subordinate Residents)|Pahang Resident]] divided Pahang state into six smaller administration areas (districts): [[Pekan District|Pekan]], [[Rompin District|Rompin]], [[Kuala Pahang]], [[Kuantan District|Kuantan]], [[Temerloh District|Temerloh]] and [[Hulu Pahang]]. The capital of Temerloh district then (1 July 1889) was Kuala Semantan. As Kuala Semantan begin to develop rapidly, the name ''Kuala Semantan'' was thought unsuitable as the {{Lang|ms|kuala}} only refers to the river confluence. Hence, Kuala Semantan changed its name to Temerloh. Before the [[British Malaya|British colonization]], Temerloh was governed by several headvillagers (village level) and {{Lang|ms|Orang Besar}} (dignitaries) under the Pahang's administration of the Orang Besar System. The Temerloh people (then) were mainly [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malay]] and Orang Asli; however, there were also small groups of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Arabs]] there.

These expressways also link Temerloh to other major towns in Pahang such as Maran, [[Karak, Pahang|Karak]] and Bentong. The new state-of-the-art Hospital Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah serves as the main hospital in Central Pahang apart from Hospital [[Mentakab]] and Hospital [[Bandar Pusat Jengka|Jengka]].

==Tourism==
[[File:T3S TEMERLOH TITIK TENGAH SEMENANJUNG.jpg|thumb|253px|[[Gnomon]] monument marking the geographic centre of [[Peninsular Malaysia]].]]
Temerloh is located around 22.7&nbsp;km (14.10&nbsp;mi) east from the geographic centre of [[Peninsular Malaysia]], which is situated at Kampung Paya Siput, [[Lanchang]] ({{Coord|3|29|33|N|102|13|10|E}}).<ref>{{cite web|title=Kampung Paya Siput diiktiraf titik tengah Semenanjung|url=http://m.utusan.com.my/berita/wilayah/kampung-paya-siput-diiktiraf-titik-tengah-semenanjung-1.132328}}</ref>

Temerloh  sits at the confluence of the [[Pahang River|Pahang]] and Semantan Rivers, attributing the town with an abundance of  with freshwater fish species such as ''patin'' ([[Pangasius]]), ''jelawat'' ([[Leptobarbus hoevenii]]), ''baung'' ([[Hemibagrus nemurus]]), ''tenggalan'' ([[Puntioplites bulu]]), ''lampam'' ([[Barbonymus]] sp), ''belida'' ([[Chitala lopis]]), [[tilapia]] and ''kerai'' ([[Hypsibarbus wetmorei]]) . As the home of the ''patin'' fish, the local cuisine exhibits dishes that bring out the taste of the fish. Located along the town's riverside, the Sunday bazaar, ''Pekan Sehari'', is a place where a wide range of commodities are sold at a reasonable price. The ''Pekan Sehari'' is said to be the longest and biggest in the whole of Pahang. The sellers normally come by riverboat early in the morning, and take their place before the customers arrive about 7:00 in the morning. Sunday mornings are busy when boats come and go ferrying passengers and goods to the ''Pekan Sehari''.

==Transportation==
[[File:Jambatan Sungei Pahang.JPG|thumb|250px|The Sultan Ahmad Shah II Bridge carries the [[East Coast Expressway]].]]
'''By road''' <br />
The [[Malaysia Federal Route 2|old Kuala Lumpur–Kuantan federal highway]] is the main route serving downtown Temerloh, though motorists now prefer the [[East Coast Expressway|LPT]] which links Temerloh all the way to [[Kuantan]] and then to [[Kuala Terengganu]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}} Mentakab is linked to Temerloh by [[Malaysia Federal Route 87]]. Temerloh is the northern end of [[Malaysia Federal Route 10|Federal Route 10]] which begins in [[Gemas]], [[Negeri Sembilan]] and runs almost parallel to [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad|KTMB]]'s [[KTM East Coast railway line|east coastal railtracks]]. [[Malaysia Federal Route 98|Federal Route 98]] joins Temerloh to [[Jerantut]], and is the main gateway to northern Pahang.

E-Hailing service at Temerloh – MyCar Temerloh. MyCar allows passengers to find drivers in minutes.

'''By rail''' <br />
The nearest train station to Temerloh is [[Mentakab railway station|Mentakab train station]] apart from other minor stations which are situated at Sungai Belengu, Kerdau and [[Kuala Krau railway station|Kuala Krau]].
