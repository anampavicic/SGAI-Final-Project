Montevideo is situated on the southern coast of the country, on the northeastern bank of the [[Río de la Plata]].

A Portuguese garrison was established in the place where today is the city of Montevideo in November 1723. The Portuguese garrison was expelled in February 1724 by a Spanish soldier, [[Bruno Mauricio de Zabala]], as a strategic move amidst the [[Spanish people|Spanish]]-[[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] dispute over the [[Río de la Plata Basin|platine region]]. There is no official document establishing the foundation of the city, but the "Diario" of Bruno Mauricio de Zabala officially mentions the date of 24 December 1726 as the foundation, corroborated by presential witnesses. The complete independence from Buenos Aires as a real city was not reached until 1 January 1730. It was also under brief [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata|British rule in 1807]], but eventually the city was retaken by Spanish  [[criollos]] who defeated the [[British invasions of the River Plate]]. Montevideo is the seat of the administrative headquarters of [[Mercosur]] and [[ALADI]], [[Latin America]]'s leading trade blocs, a position that entailed comparisons to the role of [[Brussels]] in Europe.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Google Earth Montevideo Map |url=http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/google_map_Montevideo.htm |access-date=5 March 2015 |publisher=One World – Nations Online Project |archive-date=28 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328173823/http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/google_map_Montevideo.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Etymology ==
There are several explanations for the word ''Montevideo''. All agree that "Monte" refers to the [[Fortaleza del Cerro|Cerro de Montevideo]], the hill situated across the [[Bay of Montevideo]], but there is disagreement about the etymological origin of the "video" part.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nelson Ormazábal |title=Día del Patrimonio |url=http://www.montevideanos.com/index.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428222155/http://www.montevideanos.com/index.html |archive-date=28 April 2005 |access-date=17 November 2010 |publisher=montevideanos.com |language=es |quote=Pocas villas con deseos de ser ciudad, tuvieron tantos prenombres hasta llegar al definitivo de Montevideo.

Given the relationship that the Portuguese had with the discovery and foundation of Montevideo, and despite the fact that this hypothesis, like the previous ones, lacks conclusive documentation, there have been those who linked the name of Santo Ovídio or Vídio (appearing on some maps of the time) with the subsequent derivation of the name "Montevideo" given to the region since the early years of the 16th century.

When the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|Portuguese]] invaded the [[Banda Oriental]] and annexed it as the province of [[Cisplatina]] until 1831, they called the city {{lang|pt|Montevidéu}}, and pronounced as  {{IPA|pt-PT|mõtɨviˈðew|lang}}.

=== Early history ===
Between 1680 and 1683, Portugal founded the city of [[Colonia do Sacramento]] in the region across the bay from [[Buenos Aires]]. This city met with no resistance from the Spanish until 1723, when they began to place fortifications on the elevations around Montevideo Bay. On 22 November 1723, Field Marshal {{interlanguage link|Manuel de Freitas da Fonseca|pt}} of Portugal built the Montevieu fort.

A Spanish expedition was sent from Buenos Aires, organized by the Spanish governor of that city, Bruno Mauricio de Zabala. On 22 January 1724, the Spanish forced the Portuguese to abandon the location and started populating the city, initially with six families moving in from Buenos Aires and soon thereafter by families arriving from the [[Canary Islands]] who were known as [[Guanches]] or [[Canarians]]. There was also one significant early Italian resident by the name of Jorge Burgues.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Carlos Maggi |title=La Paloma, la historia y el futuro |url=http://200.40.120.164/08/08/24/predit_365682.asp |access-date=17 November 2009 |website=El País |language=es |archive-date=29 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429050121/http://200.40.120.164/08/08/24/predit_365682.asp |url-status=dead }}</ref>

A census of the city's inhabitants was performed in 1724 and then a plan was drawn delineating the city and designating it as ''San Felipe y Santiago de Montevideo'', later shortened to Montevideo. The census counted more than 100 families of [[Galician people|Galician]] and Canary Islands origin, more than 1000 indigenous people, mostly [[Guarani people|Guaraní]], as well as some [[Atlantic slave trade|trafficked slaves]] of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu origin]].<ref name=SextMon />

A few years after its foundation, Montevideo became the main city of the region north of the Río de la Plata and east of the [[Uruguay River]], competing with Buenos Aires for dominance in maritime commerce. The importance of Montevideo as the main port of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata brought it in confrontations with the city of Buenos Aires in various occasions, including several times when it was taken over to be used as a base to defend the eastern province of the Viceroyalty from Portuguese incursions.{{cn|date=August 2024}}

In 1776, Spain made Montevideo its main naval base (''Real Apostadero de Marina'') for the South Atlantic, with authority over the Argentine coast, [[Bioko|Fernando Po]], and the [[Falkland Islands|Falklands]].<ref>Armada Nacional, 2008. http://www.armada.mil.uy/general/historia/historia-armada.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514003200/http://www.armada.mil.uy/general/historia/historia-armada.html |date=14 May 2011 }}.

Until the end of the 18th century, Montevideo remained a fortified area, today known as [[Ciudad Vieja, Montevideo|Ciudad Vieja]].

On 3 February 1807, British troops under the command of General [[Samuel Auchmuty (British Army officer)|Samuel Auchmuty]] and Admiral [[Charles Stirling]] occupied the city during the [[Battle of Montevideo (1807)]], but it was recaptured by the Spanish in the same year on 2 September when [[John Whitelocke]] was forced to surrender to troops formed by forces of the [[Banda Oriental]]—roughly the same area as modern Uruguay—and of Buenos Aires.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Segunda Invasión Inglesa (1807) |url=http://www.oni.escuelas.edu.ar/2003/SAN_LUIS/128/2invac.htm |publisher=ONI.edu.er |language=es |access-date=15 November 2010 |archive-date=21 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721193505/http://www.oni.escuelas.edu.ar/2003/SAN_LUIS/128/2invac.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> After this conflict, the governor of Montevideo [[Francisco Javier de Elío]] opposed the new viceroy [[Santiago de Liniers]], and created a government Junta when the [[Peninsular War]] started in Spain, in defiance of Liniers.

During the [[May Revolution]] of 1810 and the subsequent uprising of the provinces of Rio de la Plata, the Spanish colonial government moved to Montevideo. During that year and the next, Uruguayan revolutionary [[José Gervasio Artigas]] united with others from Buenos Aires against Spain.<ref name="Historia">{{Cite web |last=Nelson Ormazába |title=Historia |url=http://www.montevideanos.com/historia.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000830095731/http://www.montevideanos.com/historia.htm |archive-date=30 August 2000 |access-date=17 November 2009 |website=Montevideanos.com |language=es}}</ref> In 1811, the forces deployed by the [[Junta Grande]] of Buenos Aires and the [[gaucho]] forces led by Artigas started a [[Siege of Montevideo (1811)|siege of Montevideo]], which had refused to obey the directives of the new authorities of the May Revolution. The siege was lifted at the end of that year, when the military situation started deteriorating in the [[Upper Peru]] region.

The Spanish governor was expelled in 1814. In 1816, Portugal invaded the recently liberated territory and in 1821, it was annexed to the Banda Oriental of Brazil.

Uruguay's 1830s were dominated by the confrontation between [[Manuel Oribe]] and [[Fructuoso Rivera]], the two revolutionary leaders who had fought against the [[Empire of Brazil]] under the command of Lavalleja, each of whom had become the ''[[caudillo]]'' of their respective faction.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Historia General de las Relaciones Exteriores de la Argentina (1806–1989) |url=http://www.argentina-rree.com/4/4-019.htm |access-date=17 November 2009 |website=La situación en el Uruguay y el Litoral durante la década de 1830 |language=es |archive-date=3 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303235246/http://www.argentina-rree.com/4/4-019.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> Politics were divided between Oribe's ''Blancos'' ("whites"), represented by the [[National Party (Uruguay)|National Party]], and Rivera's ''Colorados'' ("reds"), represented by the [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorado Party]], with each party's name taken from the color of its emblems. In 1838, Oribe was forced to resign from the presidency; he established a rebel army and began a long civil war, the [[Uruguayan Civil War|Guerra Grande]], which lasted until 1851.

In the early 20th century, many Europeans (particularly Spaniards and Italians but also thousands from Central Europe) immigrated to the city. In 1908, 30% of the city's population of 300,000 was foreign-born. In that decade the city expanded quickly: new neighborhoods were created and many separate settlements were annexed to the city, among which were the [[Villa del Cerro]], [[Pocitos]], the [[Prado, Montevideo|Prado]] and [[Colón Sudeste|Villa Colón]]. The [[Parque Rodó|Rodó Park]] and the [[Estadio Gran Parque Central]] were also established, which served as ''poles'' of urban development.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Crecimiento Demográfico en el 1900 |url=http://www.tacuy.com.uy/Servicios/Montevideo/index.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302094006/http://www.tacuy.com.uy/Servicios/Montevideo/index.htm |archive-date=2 March 2009 |access-date=17 November 2009 |website=Tacuy.com.uy |language=es}}</ref>

[[File:Uruguay mapa.png|left|thumb|upright=1.1 |Map of Uruguay showing Montevideo on the Atlantic Ocean, between Argentina and Brazil]]
Montevideo is situated on the north shore of the Río de la Plata, the arm of the Atlantic Ocean that separates the south coast of Uruguay from the north coast of Argentina; Buenos Aires lies {{convert|230|km|mi|sp=us}} west on the Argentine side. The [[Santa Lucía River]] forms a natural border between Montevideo and [[San José Department]] to its west. To the city's north and east is [[Canelones Department]], with the stream of Carrasco forming the eastern natural border. The coastline forming the city's southern border is interspersed with rocky protrusions and sandy beaches.<ref>[http://www.montevideo.com.uy/enciclopedia/montevid.htm www.montevideo.com.uy Montevideo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030622171900/http://www.montevideo.com.uy/enciclopedia/montevid.htm |date=22 June 2003 }}, Enciclopedia Geográfica del Uruguay, Retrieved on 20 November 2010.</ref> The Bay of Montevideo forms a natural harbor, the nation's largest and one of the largest in the [[Southern Cone]], and the finest natural port in the region, functioning as a crucial component of the Uruguayan economy and foreign trade. Various streams crisscross the town and empty into the Bay of Montevideo. Its coastline near the emptying rivers are heavily polluted.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Burone L, Venturini N, Sprechmann P, Valente P, Muniz P |year=2006 |title=Foraminiferal responses to polluted sediments in the Montevideo coastal zone, Uruguay. |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |publisher=Sección Oceanología, Facultad de Ciencias, Iguá 4225, Montevideo |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=61–73 |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2005.08.007 |pmid=16194551|bibcode=2006MarPB..52...61B }}</ref>

The city has an average elevation of {{convert|43|m|ft|sp=us}}. Its highest elevations are two hills: the [[Cerro de Montevideo]] and the Cerro de la Victoria, with the highest point, the peak of Cerro de Montevideo, crowned by a fortress, the [[Fortaleza del Cerro]] at a height of {{cvt|134|m|ft}}.<ref name="Fortaleza">{{Cite web |title=Geografía – Cerro de Montevideo |url=http://www.montevideo.com.uy/enciclopedia/grande.htm#Montevideo_Cerro_de_Montevideo |access-date=20 November 2010 |publisher=Enciclopedia Geográfica del Uruguay |archive-date=5 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105050552/http://www.montevideo.com.uy/enciclopedia/grande.htm#Montevideo_Cerro_de_Montevideo |url-status=live }}</ref> Closest cities by road are [[Las Piedras, Uruguay|Las Piedras]] to the north and the so-called [[Ciudad de la Costa]] (a conglomeration of coastal towns) to the east, both in the range of 20 to {{cvt|25|km}} from the city center.

=== Climate ===
Montevideo has a [[Humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] [[Humid subtropical climate|Cfa]]) in a middle latitude, the city experiences the four seasons. It has cool winters (June to August), warm to hot summers (December to February), mild autumns (March to May) and volatile springs (September to November);<ref name="Climate">{{Cite web |title=About the Climate in Montevideo, Uruguay:Overview |url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/climate-montevideo-uruguay-16170.html |access-date=16 November 2010 |publisher=Traveltips |archive-date=30 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130012826/http://traveltips.usatoday.com/climate-montevideo-uruguay-16170.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The climate is characterized by having mild temperatures, without harsh cold or extreme heat. There are numerous thunderstorms but no tropical cyclones. Rainfall is regular and evenly spread throughout the year, reaching around {{convert|950|mm|in|sp=us}}.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Montevideo climate: Average Temperature, weather by month, Montevideo weather averages - Climate-Data.org |url=https://en.climate-data.org/america-del-sur/uruguay/montevideo/montevideo-3639/ |access-date=20 September 2019 |website=en.climate-data.org |archive-date=8 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308104313/https://en.climate-data.org/america-del-sur/uruguay/montevideo/montevideo-3639/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Winters are generally cool, wet, windy and overcast. The average temperature during this season is just above {{cvt|10|C|F}}. Daytime temperatures are generally between {{cvt|10|C|F}} and {{cvt|18|C|F}}, and night lows between {{cvt|3|C|F}} and {{cvt|10|C|F}}. During this season, there are bursts of icy and relatively dry winds of continental polar air masses, giving an unpleasant chilly feeling to the everyday life of the city, with daytime temperatures around or below {{cvt|8|C|F}} and possible night frosts. These occur few times during winter, with temperatures generally not falling below {{cvt|-2|C|F}} because of the oceanic influence that moderates the temperature; a few kilometres inland, frosts are more common and colder. On the other hand, even in the middle of winter it's not uncommon to have temperatures above {{cvt|20|C|F}} for a few days. Rainfall and [[Ice pellets|sleet]] are a frequent winter occurrence, but snowfall is extremely rare: flurries have been recorded only four times but with no accumulation, the last one on 13 July 1930 during the inaugural match of the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=FIFA World Cup |title=1930 FIFA World Cup Uruguay : Hosts Uruguay beat arch-rivals to first world crown |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=1/overview.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620232908/http://fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=1/overview.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=20 June 2007 |access-date=14 July 2011 |publisher=FIFA World Cup |location=Zúrich, Suiza}}</ref> (the other three snowfalls were in 1850, 1853 and 1917); the alleged 1980 [[Carrasco, Montevideo|Carrasco]] snowfall was actually a [[hail]]storm.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Andrés Silva Delgado |date=Dec 2010 |title=¿Nevó en Uruguay en el mes de Noviembre? |trans-title=Did it snow in Uruguay on November? |url=http://www.meteorologia.gub.uy/pdf/rrpp/23_43099.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124230720/http://www.meteorologia.gub.uy/pdf/rrpp/23_43099.pdf |archive-date=24 January 2012 |access-date=29 June 2011 |publisher=Dirección Nacional de Meteorología |location=Montevideo, Uruguay |page=1 |language=es }}</ref>

Summers are warm-hot and humid, with less wind than other seasons. The average temperature in this season is 
{{cvt|23|C|F}}. Daytime temperatures are usually between {{cvt|24|C|F}} and {{cvt|32|C|F}}, while night lows between {{cvt|14|C|F}} and {{cvt|22|C|F}}. During this season, a moderate wind often blows from the sea in the evenings which has a pleasant cooling effect on the city, in contrast to the more severe summer heat of nearby cities like [[Buenos Aires]].<ref name=Climate/> Heat waves come with the north winds, which bring humid and hot air masses from the tropical interior of the continent; temperatures can rise above {{cvt|35|C|F}}. These warm periods are usually followed by thunderstorms, generated by cold fronts from the southwest that lowers temperatures considerably. This phenomenon is regional, and can occur several times all year long.

The autumn in Montevideo is quite pleasant and not so unstable. Daytime temperatures are in general around {{cvt|20|C|F}} and nights around {{cvt|10|C|F}}.
Spring average temperatures are very similar to the autumn, but the weather in that season tends to be more windy and volatile, with more dramatic changes in a short period of time.

Montevideo has an annual average temperature of {{cvt|16.7|°C|1}}. The lowest recorded temperature is {{cvt|−5.6|°C|°F}} while the highest is {{cvt|42.8|°C|°F}}.<ref name = DNM1 />

=== Administrative divisions and barrios ===
[[File:Montevideo Map.png|thumb|right|Map of the ''barrios'' of Montevideo]]
{{As of|2010}}, the city of Montevideo has been divided into 8 political municipalities (''Municipios''), referred to with letters from A to G, including CH, each presided over by a mayor elected by the citizens registered in the constituency. This division, according to the Municipality of Montevideo, "aims to advance political and administrative decentralization in the department of Montevideo, with the aim of deepening the democratic participation of citizens in governance."<ref>[http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/institucional/gobiernos-municipales/informacion-general Información general|Intendencia de Montevideo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426043951/http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/institucional/gobiernos-municipales/informacion-general |date=26 April 2011 }}. Montevideo.gub.uy (23 August 2010). Retrieved on 20 November 2010.</ref> The head of each ''Municipio'' is called an ''alcalde'' or (if female) ''alcaldesa''.<ref>[http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/institucional/gobiernos-municipales/alcaldes-y-alcaldesas Alcaldes y alcaldesas|Intendencia de Montevideo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830143926/http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/institucional/gobiernos-municipales/alcaldes-y-alcaldesas |date=30 August 2010 }}. Montevideo.gub.uy. Retrieved on 20 November 2010.</ref>

Of much greater importance is the division of the city into 62 ''barrios'': neighborhoods or wards.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Barrios of Montevideo, Uruguay |url=http://www.explore-uruguay.com/barrios-of-montevideo-uruguay.html |access-date=19 November 2010 |publisher=Explore Uruguay |archive-date=8 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208074248/http://www.explore-uruguay.com/barrios-of-montevideo-uruguay.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Many of the city's ''barrios''—such as [[Sayago, Montevideo|Sayago]], [[Ituzaingó, Montevideo|Ituzaingó]] and [[Pocitos]]—were previously geographically separate settlements, later absorbed by the growth of the city. Others grew up around certain industrial sites, including the [[Salting (food)|salt-curing]] works of [[Villa del Cerro]] and the [[tannery (facility)|tanneries]] in [[Nuevo París]]. Each ''barrio'' has its own identity, geographic location and socio-cultural activities. A neighborhood of great significance is Ciudad Vieja, that was surrounded by a protective wall until 1829. This area contains most important buildings of the colonial era and early decades of independence.

[[File:Letras Montevideo en Pocitos.jpg|left|thumb|232x232px|[[Pocitos]] is the most populous Montevideo neighborhood.]]
The architecture of Montevideo ranges from [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] buildings such as the [[Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral]] to the late-modern style of the [[World Trade Center Montevideo]] or the {{convert|158|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Antel Tower|ANTEL Telecommunication Tower]], the tallest skyscraper in the country. Along with the Telecommunications Tower, the [[Palacio Salvo]] dominates the skyline of the Bay of Montevideo. The building facades in the Old Town reflect the city's extensive European immigration, displaying the influence of old European architecture. Notable government buildings include the [[Palacio Legislativo (Uruguay)|Legislative Palace]], the [[City Hall of Montevideo|City Hall]], [[Estévez Palace]] and the [[Executive Tower]]. The most notable sports stadium is the [[Estadio Centenario]] within [[Parque Batlle]]. Parque Batlle, [[Parque Rodó]] and [[Prado, Montevideo|Parque Prado]] are Montevideo's three great parks.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Parques y plazas |url=http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/ciudad/paseos/parques-y-plazas |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426044228/http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/ciudad/paseos/parques-y-plazas |archive-date=26 April 2011 |access-date=20 November 2010 |publisher=Intendencia de Montevideo}}</ref>

The [[Pocitos]] district, near the beach of the same name, has many homes built by Bello and Reboratti between 1920 and 1940, with a mixture of styles. Other landmarks in Pocitos are the "[[Edificio Panamericano]]" designed by Raul Sichero,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Platero, Guillermo Gómez |title=Guillermo Gómez Platero, arquitecto |publisher=Editorial Dos Puntos |year=2002}}</ref> and the "Positano" and "El Pilar" designed by Adolfo Sommer Smith and {{interlanguage link|Luis García Pardo|es}} in the 1950s and 1960s. However, the construction boom of the 1970s and 1980s transformed the face of this neighborhood, with a cluster of modern apartment buildings for upper and upper middle-class residents.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==== World Trade Center Montevideo ====

[[File:World Trade Center Montevideo.jpg|thumb|left|[[World Trade Center Montevideo]].]]
{{main|World Trade Center Montevideo}}
[[World Trade Center Montevideo]] officially opened in 1998, but work was completed in 2009. The complex is composed of three towers, two three-story buildings called World Trade Center Plaza and World Trade Center Avenue and a large central square called Towers Square. World Trade Center 1 was the first building to be inaugurated, in 1998.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} It has 22 floors and 17,100 square meters of space. That same year the avenue and the auditorium were raised. World Trade Center 2 was inaugurated in 2002, a twin tower of World Trade Center 1. Finally, in 2009, World Trade Center 3 and the World Trade Center Plaza and the Towers Square were inaugurated. It is located between the avenues Luis Alberto de Herrera and 26 de Marzo and has 19 floors and {{convert|27000|sqm|sqft|sp=us}} of space. The {{convert|6300|sqm|sqft|adj=on|sp=us}} {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} World Trade Center Plaza is designed to be a center of gastronomy opposite Towers Square and Bonavita St.

The Towers Square, is an area of remarkable aesthetic design, intended to be a platform for the development of business activities, art exhibitions, dance and music performances and social places. This square connects the different buildings and towers which comprise the WTC Complex and it is the main access to the complex. The square contains various works of art, notably a sculpture by renowned Uruguayan sculptor [[Pablo Atchugarry]]. World Trade Center 4, with 40 floors and {{convert|53500|sqm|sqft|sp=us}} of space is under construction {{As of|2010|lc=y}}.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==== Telecommunications Tower ====
[[File:Torre Antel - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Antel Tower|Telecommunications Tower]].]]
{{Main|Telecommunications Tower (Montevideo)}}
Torre de las Telecomunicaciones (Telecommunications Tower) or Torre Antel (Antel Tower) is the {{convert|158|m|ft|sp=us}}, 37-floor headquarters of Uruguay's [[government-owned]] telecommunications company, [[ANTEL]], and is the tallest building in the country. It was designed by architect [[Carlos Ott]]. It is situated by the side of the Bay of Montevideo. The tower was completed by [[American Bridge Company]] and other design/build consortium team members on 15 March 2000.

When its construction was announced, many politicians complained about its cost (US$40&nbsp;million, plus US$25&nbsp;million for the construction of the other 5 buildings of the Telecommunications Complex). Problems during its construction turned the original US$65&nbsp;million price into US$102&nbsp;million.

==== Ciudad Vieja (Old City) ====
{{main|Ciudad Vieja, Montevideo}}
[[File:Alcohólicos Anónimos, Montevideo URU.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of Alcohólicos Anónimos in Montevideo]]
Ciudad Vieja was the earliest part of the city to be developed and today it constitutes a prominent ''[[barrio]]'' of southwest Montevideo. It contains many colonial buildings and national heritage sites, but also many banks, administrative offices, museums, art galleries, cultural institutions, restaurants and nightclubs, making it vibrant with life. Its northern coast is the main port of Uruguay, one of the few deep-draft ports in the Southern Cone of South America.

[[File:PlazaConstitución.jpg|thumb|left|Plaza de la Constitución in winter.]]
Montevideo's most important [[plaza]] is [[Plaza Independencia]], located between Ciudad Vieja and [[Centro, Montevideo|downtown]] Montevideo. It starts with the [[Ciudadela, Montevideo|Gateway of The Citadel]] at one end and ends at the beginning of [[18 de Julio Avenue]]. It is the remaining part of the wall that surrounded the oldest part of the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Visiting Colonia and Montevideo Uruguay: Recipe for a great visit |url=http://www.offbeattravel.com/uruguay-montevideo-colonia-attractions.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204134633/http://www.offbeattravel.com/uruguay-montevideo-colonia-attractions.html |archive-date=4 December 2010 |access-date=18 November 2010 |publisher=Offbeattravel}}</ref> Several notable buildings are located here. 
[[File:TEATRO SOLIS 01.JPG|thumb|Solís Theatre.]]The [[Solís Theatre]] is Uruguay's oldest theater. It was built in 1856 and is owned by the government of Montevideo. In 1998, the government of Montevideo started a major reconstruction of the theater, which included two US$110,000 columns designed by [[Philippe Starck]]. The reconstruction was completed in 2004, and the theater reopened in August of that year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/archivo/Nota.asp?nota_id=630831|title="Se reabrió el Teatro Solís", ''La Nación'', 27 August 2004|access-date=28 November 2018|archive-date=31 August 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040831055419/http://www.lanacion.com.ar/archivo/Nota.asp?nota_id=630831|url-status=dead}}</ref> The plaza is also the site of the offices of the [[President of Uruguay]] (both the [[Estévez Palace]] and the [[Executive Tower]]). The [[Artigas Mausoleum]] is located at the center of the plaza. Statues include that of [[José Gervasio Artigas]], a hero of Uruguay's independence movement; an honor guard keeps vigil at the Mausoleum.<ref name="Sights">{{Cite web |title=Sights in Montevideo |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/uruguay/montevideo/sights |access-date=16 November 2010 |publisher=Lonely Planet |archive-date=30 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430184547/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/uruguay/montevideo/sights |url-status=live }}</ref>
[[Palacio Salvo]], at the intersection of 18 de Julio Avenue and Plaza Independencia, was designed by the architect [[Mario Palanti]] and completed in 1925. Palanti, an Italian immigrant living in Buenos Aires, used a similar design for his [[Palacio Barolo]] in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Palacio Salvo stands {{convert|100|m|ft|sp=us}} high, including its antenna. It is built on the former site of the Confitería La Giralda, renowned for being where [[Gerardo Matos Rodríguez]] wrote his tango "[[La Cumparsita]]" (1917.)<ref>[http://www.jaimegorenstein.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1099&Itemid=1090 Buscando la Verdad – La Cumparcita] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430014946/http://www.jaimegorenstein.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1099&Itemid=1090 |date=30 April 2011 }} at [http://www.jaimegorenstein.com jaimegorenstein.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181102220625/http://jaimegorenstein.com/ |date=2 November 2018 }}</ref> Palacio Salvo was originally intended to function as a hotel but is now a mixture of offices and private residences.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mimi Bohm |title=Buenos Aires, Art Nouveau |publisher=Ediciones Xavier Verstraeten |year=2005 |location=Buenos Aires}}</ref>

Also of major note in Ciudad Vieja is the [[Constitution Square (Montevideo)|Plaza de la Constitución]] (or ''Plaza Matriz''). During the first decades of Uruguayan independence this square was the main hub of city life. On the square are the [[Cabildo de Montevideo|Cabildo]]—the seat of colonial government—and the [[Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral]]. The cathedral is the burial place of [[Fructuoso Rivera]], [[Juan Antonio Lavalleja]] and [[Venancio Flores]]. Another notable square is [[Plaza Zabala]] with the equestrian statue of [[Bruno Mauricio de Zabala]]. On its south side, [[Palacio Taranco]], once residence of the Ortiz Taranco brothers, is now the Museum of Decorative Arts. A few blocks northwest of Plaza Zabala is the Mercado del Puerto, another major tourist destination.

Directly west of the main park area, and belonging to Parque Rodó ''barrio'', there is the former ''Parque Hotel'', now called ''Edifício Mercosur'', the seat of the parliament of the member countries of the [[Mercosur]].<ref name="ParlMercosur">{{Cite web |title=Visitas al Parlamento |url=http://www.parlamentodelmercosur.org/innovaportal/v/158/1/secretaria/visitas_al_parlamento.html?rightmenuid=154 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513183859/http://www.parlamentodelmercosur.org/innovaportal/v/158/1/secretaria/visitas_al_parlamento.html?rightmenuid=154 |archive-date=13 May 2011 |access-date=21 November 2010 |publisher=Parlamento del Mercosur}}</ref> During the guerilla war the [[Tupamaros]] frequently attacked buildings in this area, including the old hotel.<ref>Buchert, Beverly J., ''The Tupamaros: anomalies of guerrilla war'', [[University of Kansas]], 1979</ref>

==== Forts ====
The first set of subsidiary forts was planned by the Portuguese at Montevideo in 1701 to establish a front-line base to stop frequent insurrections by the Spaniards emanating from Buenos Aires. These fortifications were planned within the River Plate estuary at [[Colonia del Sacramento]]. However, this plan came to fruition only in November 1723, when Captain Manuel Henriques de Noronha reached the shores of Montevideo with soldiers, guns and colonists on his warship ''Nossa Senhora de Oliveara''. They built a small square fortification. However, under siege from forces from Buenos Aires, the Portuguese withdrew from Montevideo Bay in January 1724, after signing an agreement with the Spaniards.<ref name="Marley">{{Cite book |last=David |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q1a4j2HNmjUC&pg=PA817 |title=Historic cities of the Americas: an illustrated encyclopedia, Volume 1 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2005 |isbn=1-57607-027-1 |page=817 |access-date=17 November 2010 |archive-date=5 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231005141502/https://books.google.com/books?id=q1a4j2HNmjUC&pg=PA817 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===== Fortaleza del Cerro (Fortress del Cerro) =====

{{main|Fortaleza del Cerro}}
Fortaleza del Cerro overlooks the bay of Montevideo. An observation post at this location was first built by the Spanish in the late 18th century. In 1802, a beacon replaced the observation post; construction of the fortress began in 1809 and was completed in 1839.<ref name="Fortaleza" /> It has been involved in many historical developments and has been repeatedly taken over by various sides. In 1907, the old beacon was replaced with a stronger electric one. It has been a National Monument since 1931<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cerro – Municipio A |url=http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/ciudad/datos-%C3%BAtiles/barrios/cerro-municipio |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426045044/http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/ciudad/datos-%C3%BAtiles/barrios/cerro-municipio |archive-date=26 April 2011 |access-date=20 November 2010 |publisher=Intendencia de Montevideo}}</ref> and has housed a military museum since 1916.<ref name="Fortaleza" /> Today it is one of the tourist attractions of Montevideo.

====Punta Brava Lighthouse====
[[File:Faro Punta Brava, Montevideo.jpg|thumb|Punta Brava lighthouse.]]
[[Punta Brava Lighthouse]] (''Faro Punta Brava''), also known as Punta Carretas Lighthouse, was erected in 1876.

The lighthouse is important for guiding boats into the Banco Inglés Buceo Port or the entrance of the Santa Lucía River.

==== Rambla of Montevideo ====
{{main|Rambla of Montevideo}}
The '''Rambla''' is an avenue that goes along the entire [[coastline]] of Montevideo. The literal meaning of the Spanish word ''rambla'' is "avenue" or "watercourse", but in the Americas it is mostly used as "coastal avenue", and since all the southern [[departments of Uruguay]] border either the Río de la Plata or the Atlantic Ocean, they all have ''ramblas'' as well. As an integral part of Montevidean identity, the Rambla has been included by Uruguay in the Indicative List of [[List of World Heritage Sites in the Americas|World Heritage]] sites,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/delegates/uruguay/noticial.html#actualiza|title=UNESCO: Rambla of Montevideo candidacy}}</ref> though it has not received this status. Previously, the entire Rambla was called ''Rambla Naciones Unidas'' ("United Nations"), but in recent times different names have been given to specific parts of it.

The Rambla is a very important site for recreation and leisure in Montevideo. Every day, a large number of people go there to take long strolls, jog, bicycle, roller skate, fish and even—in a special area—skateboard. Its {{convert|27|km|adj=on|sp=us}} length makes it one of the longest esplanades in the world.<ref name="Rambla">{{Cite web |title=Rambla |url=http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/ciudad/paseos/costa/rambla |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026233515/http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/ciudad/paseos/costa/rambla |archive-date=26 October 2010 |access-date=12 December 2010 |publisher=Intendencia de Montevideo}}</ref>

Montevideo is noted for its beaches, which are particularly important because 60% of the population spends the summer in the city.<ref name="Rambla" /> Its best-known beaches are Ramírez, [[Pocitos]], [[Carrasco, Montevideo|Carrasco]], [[Buceo]] and [[Malvín]]. Further east and west are other beaches including the Colorada, Punta Espinillo, Punta Yeguas, Zabala and Santa Catarina.

==== Cemeteries ====
[[File:2016 cementerio Montevideo.jpg|thumb|left|Central Cemetery.]]
There are five large [[cemetery|cemeteries]] in Montevideo, all administered by the "Fúnebre y Necrópolis" annex of the Intendencia of Montevideo.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fúnebre y Necrópolis &#124; Intendencia de Montevideo |url=http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/dependencias/1087 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805084235/http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/dependencias/1087 |archive-date=5 August 2011 |access-date=16 September 2011 |publisher=Montevideo.gub.uy}}</ref>

The largest cemetery is the [[Cementerio del Norte, Montevideo|Cementerio del Norte]], located in the northern-central part of the city. The [[Central Cemetery of Montevideo|Central Cemetery]] (Spanish: ''Cementerio central''), located in [[Barrio Sur, Montevideo|Barrio Sur]] in the southern area of the city, is one of Uruguay's main cemeteries. It was one of the first cemeteries (in contrast to church graveyards) in the country, founded in 1835 at a time when burials were still carried out by the Catholic Church. It is the burial place of many of the most famous Uruguayans, such as [[Eduardo Blanco Acevedo|Eduardo Acevedo]], [[Delmira Agustini]], [[Luis Batlle Berres]], [[José Batlle y Ordóñez]], [[Juan Manuel Blanes]], François Ducasse, father of [[Comte de Lautréamont]] (Isidore Ducasse),<ref>[http://www.elpais.com.uy/Suple/DS/09/02/22/sds_400223.asp ''Arte oculto en el cementerio''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830091521/http://www.elpais.com.uy/Suple/DS/09/02/22/sds_400223.asp |date=30 August 2010 }} – elpais.com.uy {{in lang|es}}</ref> [[Luis Alberto de Herrera]], [[Benito Nardone]], [[José Enrique Rodó]], and [[Juan Zorrilla de San Martín]].

The other large cemeteries are the [[Cementerio del Buceo]], [[Cementerio del Cerro, Montevideo|Cementerio del Cerro]], and [[Cementerio Paso Molino]].
[[The British Cemetery Montevideo]] (Cementerio Británico) is another of the oldest cemeteries in Uruguay, located in the [[Buceo]] neighborhood. Many [[nobility|noblemen]] and eminent persons are buried there. The cemetery originated when the Englishman Thomas Samuel Hood purchased a plot of land in the name of the English residents in 1828. However, in 1884 the government compensated the British by moving the cemetery to Buceo to accommodate city growth. A section of the cemetery, known as [[British Cemetery Montevideo Soldiers and Sailors]], contains the graves of quite a number of sailors of different nationalities, although the majority are of British descent. One [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine]], Henry de Costa, is buried here.<ref>[http://montevideo.usembassy.gov/usaweb/paginas/55-00EN.shtml Lone U.S. Marine in British Cemetery honoured on U.S. Marine Corps birthday] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527200342/http://montevideo.usembassy.gov/usaweb/paginas/55-00EN.shtml |date=27 May 2010 }}</ref>

=== Demographics ===

In 1860, Montevideo had 57,913 inhabitants including a number of people of [[Afro-Uruguayan|African origin]] who had been brought as slaves and had gained their freedom around the middle of the century. By 1880, the population had quadrupled, mainly because of the great European immigration. In 1908, its population had grown massively to 309,331 inhabitants.<ref name="Javier Meneses Silva">{{Cite web |last=Javier Meneses Silva |title=Datos en el cuerpo de todo el artículo |url=http://www.tacuy.com.uy/Servicios/Montevideo/index.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302094006/http://www.tacuy.com.uy/Servicios/Montevideo/index.htm |archive-date=2 March 2009 |access-date=15 November 2010 |publisher=Tacuy.com.uy |language=es}}</ref> In the course of the 20th century the city continued to receive large numbers of European immigrants, especially Spanish and [[Italian settlement in Uruguay|Italian]], followed by Portuguese Brazilians, [[French Uruguayan|French]], Germans, English, Irish, Swiss, Austrians, Poles, Dutch, [[Greeks in Uruguay|Greek]], Hungarians, Russians, Croats, [[Lebanese Uruguayan|Lebanese]], [[Armenians in Uruguay|Armenians]], and Jews of various origins.<ref name="rincondelvago">{{Cite web |title=Emigración en Uruguay |date=23 November 2004 |url=http://html.rincondelvago.com/emigracion-en-uruguay.html |access-date=25 November 2010 |publisher=El Rincón del Vago |archive-date=9 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209142548/http://html.rincondelvago.com/emigracion-en-uruguay.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> The last wave of immigrants occurred between 1945 and 1955.<ref name="tacuycom" />

According to the census survey carried out between 15 June and 31 July 2004, Montevideo had a population of 1,325,968 persons, compared to Uruguay's total population of 3,241,003. The female population was 707,697 (53.4%) while the male population accounted for 618,271 (46.6%). The population had declined since the previous census carried out in 1996, with an average annual growth rate of −1.5 per thousand. The continual decline has been documented since the census period of 1975–1985, which showed a rate of −5.6 per thousand. The decrease is due in large part to lowered fertility, partly offset by mortality, and to a smaller degree in migration. The birth rate declined by 19% from 1996 (17 per thousand) to 2004 (13.8 per thousand). Similarly, the total fertility rate (TFR) declined from 2.24 in 1996 to 1.79 in 2004. However, mortality continued to fall with [[life expectancy at birth]] for both sexes increasing by 1.73 years.<ref name="census2004pdf">{{Cite web |title=Census Phase I, 2004 |url=http://www.ine.gub.uy/fase1new/montevideo/montevideo_pres.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.ine.gub.uy/fase1new/montevideo/montevideo_pres.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |publisher=Government of Uruguay |pages=4, 11, 13, 17, 22, 23}}</ref>

[[File:Intendencia de Montevideo 02.jpg|thumb|235x235px|The [[Palacio Municipal (Montevideo)|Palacio Municipal]] is the [[City Hall]] of Montevideo.]]
The Intendancy of Montevideo was first created by a legal act of 18 December 1908.<ref>[http://www.ccee.edu.uy/ensenian/catderpu/material/departamentales.PDF Propiedad de las Chacras del Ejido de Bella Union] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427042410/http://www.ccee.edu.uy/ensenian/catderpu/material/departamentales.PDF |date=27 April 2011 }}, Asociación de Escribanos del Uruguay Informe de la Comisión de Derecho Público {{in lang|es}}</ref> The municipality's first mayor (1909–1911) was Daniel Muñoz. Municipalities were abolished by the [[Uruguayan Constitution of 1918]], effectively restored during the 1933 military coup of [[Gabriel Terra]], and formally restored by the [[Uruguayan Constitution of 1934|1934 Constitution]]. The [[Uruguayan Constitution of 1952|1952 Constitution]] again decided to abolish the municipalities; it came into effect in February 1955. Municipalities were replaced by departmental councils, which consisted of a collegiate executive board with 7 members from Montevideo and 5 from the interior region. However, municipalities were revived under the 1967 Constitution and have operated continuously since that time.

Since 1990, Montevideo has been partially decentralized into 18 areas; administration and services for each area is provided by its Zonal Community Center (''Centro Comunal Zonal'', CCZ), which is subordinate to the Intendancy of Montevideo.<ref>[http://www.chasque.net/vecinet/goblocal.htm Los Organos del Gobierno Local y el Presupuesto Participativo de Montevideo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118094746/http://www.chasque.net/vecinet/goblocal.htm |date=18 November 2010 }}.

In the early 1970s (1973, to be particular) when the military junta took over power in Uruguay, art suffered in Montevideo. The art studios went into protest mode, with [[Rimer Cardillo]], one of the country's leading artists, making the National Institute of Fine Arts, Montevideo a "hotbed of resistance". This resulted in the military junta coming down heavily on artists by closing the Fine Art Institute and carting away all the presses and other studio equipment. Consequently, the learning of fine arts was only in private studios run by people who had been let out of jail, in works of printing and on paper and also painting and sculpture. It resumed much later.<ref name="Dorsky">{{Cite book |last=Samuel Dorsky Museum of Art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bOno-rgMuP8C&pg=PA11 |title=Rimer Cardillo: Impressions (and Other Images of Memory) 16 October – 12 December 2004 |publisher=SUNY Press |year=2004 |isbn=1-4384-3110-4 |pages=11–13 |access-date=17 November 2010 |archive-date=5 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231005141552/https://books.google.com/books?id=bOno-rgMuP8C&pg=PA11#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Literature ====
The first public library in Montevideo was formed by the initial donation of the private library of Father José Manuel Pérez Castellano, who died in 1815. Its promoter, director and organizer was Father [[Dámaso Antonio Larrañaga]], who also made a considerable donation along with donations from José Raimundo Guerra, as well as others from the Convent of San Francisco in [[Salta]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=mec-historia |url=http://www.bibna.gub.uy/historia.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110428032254/http://www.bibna.gub.uy/historia.html |archive-date=28 April 2011 |access-date=12 December 2010 |publisher=Ministerio de Ecucacion y Cultura |language=es}}</ref> In 1816 its stock was 5,000 volumes.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Appel |first=John Wilton |date=1994 |title=Francisco José de Caldas: A Scientist at Work in Nueva Granada |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1006650 |journal=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society |volume=84 |issue=5 |pages=1–154 |doi=10.2307/1006650 |jstor=1006650 |issn=0065-9746 |access-date=7 October 2022 |archive-date=7 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221007161955/https://www.jstor.org/stable/1006650 |url-status=live }}</ref> The building of the [[National Library of Uruguay]] (''Biblioteca Pública de Uruguay'') was designed by Luis Crespi in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style and occupies an area of {{convert|4000|sqm|sqft|sp=us}}.

==== Authors ====
[[File:Delmira Agustini.jpg|right|upright|thumb| The poet [[Delmira Agustini]].]]
The city has a long and rich literary tradition. Although [[Uruguayan literature]] is not limited to the authors of the capital ([[Horacio Quiroga]] was born in [[Salto, Uruguay|Salto]] and [[Mario Benedetti]] in [[Paso de los Toros]], for instance), Montevideo has been and is the center of the editorial and creative activity of literature.

In 1900, the city had a remarkable group of writers, including [[José Enrique Rodó]], [[Carlos Vaz Ferreira]], [[Julio Herrera y Reissig]], [[Delmira Agustini]] and [[Felisberto Hernández]]. Montevideo was then called the "Atenas del Plata" or the "[[Athens]] of the Rio de la Plata".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Javier Meneses Silva |title=Movimiento cultural |url=http://www.tacuy.com.uy/Servicios/Montevideo/index.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302094006/http://www.tacuy.com.uy/Servicios/Montevideo/index.htm |archive-date=2 March 2009 |access-date=16 November 2010 |publisher=Tacuy.com.uy |language=es}}</ref>
[[File:Eduardo Galeano - conferenza Vicenza 2.jpg|left|upright=0.75|thumb|The writer [[Eduardo Galeano]].]]
Among the outstanding authors of Montevideo of the second half of the 20th century are [[Juan Carlos Onetti]], [[Antonio Larreta]], [[Eduardo Galeano]], [[Marosa di Giorgio]] and [[Cristina Peri Rossi]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=El poder de la palabra |url=http://www.epdlp.com/paise.php?pais=Uruguay |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025162441/http://www.epdlp.com/paise.php?pais=Uruguay |archive-date=25 October 2010 |access-date=16 November 2010 |publisher=epdlp.com |language=es}}</ref>

A new generation of writers has become known internationally in recent years. These include Eduardo Espina (essayist and poet), [[Fernando Butazzoni]] (novelist), {{interlanguage link|Rafael Courtoisie|es}} (poet) and [[Hugo Burel]] (short story writer and novelist).

==== Music ====
In Montevideo, as throughout the Rio de Plata region, the most popular forms of music are [[tango music|tango]], [[Milonga (music)|milonga]] and ''[[vals criollo]]''. Many notable songs originated in Montevideo including "El Tango supremo", "La Cumparsita", "La Milonga", "La Puñalada" and "[[Desde el Alma]]", composed by notable Montevideo musicians such as [[Gerardo Matos Rodríguez]], [[Pintín Castellanos]] and [[Rosita Melo]].<ref name="SC1">{{Cite web |title=Montevideo, Uruguay |url=http://www.spanishcourses.info/cities/montevideo-uruguay-41-EN.htm |access-date=18 November 2010 |publisher=Spanish courses |archive-date=28 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128172814/http://spanishcourses.info/cities/montevideo-uruguay-41-EN.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Tango is deeply ingrained in the cultural life of the city and is the theme for many of the bars and restaurants in the city. 20th. century composers like three-time [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]] nominated [[Miguel del Águila|Miguel del Aguila]] have taken Uruguayan tango to international classical music audiences. ''Fun Fun' Bar'', established in 1935, is one of the most important places for tango in Uruguay as is ''El Farolito'', located in the old part of the city and ''Joventango'', ''Café Las Musas'', ''Garufa'' and ''Vieja Viola''.<ref name="SC1" /> The city is also home to the Montevideo Jazz Festival and has the Bancaria Jazz Club bar catering for jazz enthusiasts.

===Cuisine===

{{main|Cuisine of Montevideo}}
The center of traditional Uruguayan food and beverage in Montevideo is the Mercado del Puerto ("Port Market"). Beef is very important in Uruguayan cuisine and an essential part of many dishes. A ''[[torta frita]]'' is a pan-fried cake consumed in Montevideo and throughout Uruguay. It is generally circular, with a small cut in the center for cooking, and is made from wheat flour, yeast, water and sugar or salt.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Torta Frita Cuando Llueve |url=http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/ciudad/cultura/costumbres/torta-frita-cuando-llueve |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426044739/http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/ciudad/cultura/costumbres/torta-frita-cuando-llueve |archive-date=26 April 2011 |access-date=21 November 2010 |publisher=Montevideo.gub.uy}}</ref> Montevideo has a variety of restaurants, from traditional [[Uruguayan cuisine]] to [[Japanese cuisine]].

The [[Palacio Taranco]] is located in front of the [[Plaza Zabala]], in the heart of Ciudad Vieja. It was erected in the early 20th century as the residence of the Ortiz Taranco brothers on the ruins of Montevideo's first theater (of 1793), during a period in which the architectural style was influenced by French architecture. The palace was designed by French architects [[Charles Louis Girault]] and {{interlanguage link|Jules-Léon Chifflot|fr}} who also designed the [[Petit Palais]] and the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in Paris. It passed to the city from the heirs of the Tarancos in 1943, along with its precious collection of Uruguayan furniture and draperies and was deemed by the city as an ideal place for a museum; in 1972 it became the Museum of Decorative Arts of Montevideo and in 1975 it became a National Heritage Site.<ref name="Frommers">{{Cite book |last1=Shawn Blore |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmW-7wfC1TMC&q=montevideo+hotel&pg=PA688 |title=Frommer's South America |last2=Alexandra de Vries |last3=Eliot Greenspan |last4=Haas Mroue |last5=Michael Luongo |last6=Charlie O'Malley |last7=Kristina Schreck |last8=Neil E.

[[File:Catedralmontevideo.jpg|thumb|Cathedral Interior|231x231px]]
{{Main|Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral}}
The Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral is the main Roman Catholic church of Montevideo. It is located in Ciudad Vieja, immediately across [[Constitution Square (Montevideo)|Constitution Square]] from the [[Montevideo Cabildo|Cabildo]]. In 1740 a brick church was built on the site. In 1790, the foundation was laid for the current neoclassical structure. The church was consecrated in 1804.<ref name=travel/> Bicentennial celebrations were held in 2004.

In 1897, [[Pope Leo XIII]] elevated the church to Metropolitan Cathedral status. Important ceremonies are conducted under the direction of the Archbishop of Montevideo. Weddings and choral concerts are held here and the parish priest conducts the routine functions of the cathedral. In the 19th century, its precincts were also used as a burial place of famous people who died in the city. For decades, the prison and the nearby [[Punta Carretas|Punta Carretas parish church]] were the only major buildings in the neighborhood.

==== Nuestra Señora del Sagrado Corazón ====
[[File:2016 fachada de la Iglesia de Nuestra Señora del Sagrado Corazón de Montevido.jpg|thumb|Punta Carretas Church|279x279px]]
Nuestra Señora del Sagrado Corazón ("Our Lady of the Sacred Heart"), also known as Iglesia Punta Carretas ("Punta Carretas Church"), was built between 1917 and 1927 in the Romanesque Revival style. The church was originally part of the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin]], but is presently in the parish of the Ecclesiastic Curia. Its location is at the corner of Solano García and José Ellauri. It has a nave and aisles. The roof has many vaults. During the construction of the Punta Carretas Shopping complex, major cracks developed in the structure of the church as a result of differential foundation settlement.<ref name="HCV" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=Iglesia de Sagrado Corazón by anaines |url=http://www.trekearth.com/gallery/South_America/Uruguay/South/Montevideo/Montevideo/photo741444.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220024623/http://www.trekearth.com/gallery/South_America/Uruguay/South/Montevideo/Montevideo/photo741444.htm |archive-date=20 February 2012 |access-date=20 November 2010 |publisher=Trekearth}}</ref>

Montevideo is the heartland of retailing in Uruguay. The city has become the principal center of business and real estate, including many expensive buildings and modern towers for residences and offices, surrounded by extensive green spaces. In 1985, the first shopping center in Rio de la Plata, [[Montevideo Shopping]] was built.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Remo Pedreschi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jK4QyY4vIHgC&q=Montevideo+Shopping++1985&pg=PA106 |title=The engineer's contribution to contemporary architecture |publisher=Thomas Telford |year=2000 |isbn=0-7277-2772-9 |pages=106–112 |access-date=22 October 2020 |archive-date=5 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231005141509/https://books.google.com/books?id=jK4QyY4vIHgC&q=Montevideo+Shopping++1985&pg=PA106#v=snippet&q=Montevideo%20Shopping%20%201985&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1994, with the building of three more shopping complexes such as the [[Tres Cruces bus station|Shopping Tres Cruces]], [[Portones Shopping]], and [[Punta Carretas Shopping]], the business map of the city changed dramatically.

[[File:Colonia_del_Sacramento_2016_042.jpg|thumb|[[Buquebus]] high-speed ferries connect Montevideo to [[Argentina]]|230x230px]]
Montevideo is also served by a [[Ferry|ferry system]] operated by the company [[Buquebus]] that connects the port with [[Buenos Aires]]. More than 2.2&nbsp;million people per year travel between Argentina and Uruguay with Buquebus. One of these ships is a [[catamaran]], which can reach a top speed of about {{convert|80|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Buquebus |url=http://www.buquebus.com/cache/HomeARG.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621063259/http://www.buquebus.com/cache/HomeARG.html |archive-date=21 June 2009 |access-date=9 August 2009 |publisher=Buquebus}}</ref>[[File:stk 1340.jpg|thumb|Port of Montevideo|left|226x226px]]The port on Montevideo Bay is one of the reasons the city was founded. It gives natural protection to ships, although two jetties now further protect the harbor entrance from waves. This natural port is competitive with the other great port of Río de la Plata, Buenos Aires.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Infraestructura Física – Proyecto Nueva Terminal de Contenedores del Puerto de Montevideo. |url=http://www.anp.com.uy/montevideo/infraestructura/mvd_infraestructura.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216022436/http://www.anp.com.uy/montevideo/infraestructura/mvd_infraestructura.asp |archive-date=16 December 2009 |access-date=17 November 2009 |publisher=Puerto de Montevideo |language=es}}</ref>
The main engineering work on the port occurred between the years 1870 and 1930. These six decades saw the construction of the port's first wooden pier, several warehouses in La Aguada, the north and south Rambla, a river port, a new pier, the dredged river basin and the [[La Teja Refinery]]. A major storm in 1923 necessitated repairs to many of the city's engineering works.<ref name="PieGau" /> Since the second half of the 20th century, until the 21st century, physical changes had ceased, and since that time the area had degraded due to national economic stagnation.<ref name="PieGau" />

The port's proximity has contributed to the installation of various industries in the area surrounding the bay, particularly import/export businesses and other business related to port and naval activity. The density of industrial development in the area surrounding the port has kept its popularity as a residential area relatively low despite its centrality. The main environmental problems are subaquatic sedimentation and air and water contamination.<ref name=PieGau />

The process of founding the country's public university began on 11 June 1833 with the passage of a law proposed by Senator Dámaso Antonio Larrañaga. It called for the creation of nine academic departments; the President of the Republic would pass a decree formally creating the departments once the majority of them were in operation. In 1836, the House of General Studies was formed, housing the departments of Latin, philosophy, mathematics, theology and jurisprudence. On 27 May 1838, [[Manuel Oribe]] passed a decree establishing the Greater University of the Republic.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Portal de la UdelaR – Historia |url=http://www.universidad.edu.uy/renderPage/index/pageId/98#heading_761 |access-date=22 November 2010 |publisher=UdelaR |archive-date=28 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328031527/http://www.universidad.edu.uy/renderPage/index/pageId/98#heading_761 |url-status=live }}</ref> That decree had few practical effects, given the institutional instability of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay at that time.

In Montevideo, as elsewhere in the country, there are both public and private health services. In both sectors, medical services are provided by [[polyclinic]]s and hospitals or sanatorios. The term ''hospital'' is used here for both outpatient and inpatient facilities, while ''sanatorio'' is used for private short- and long-term facilities for the treatment of illnesses.

===Public hospitals===
[[Manuel Quintela Clinic Hospital|Hospital de Clínicas "Dr. Manuel Quintela"]] is a University Hospital attached to the [[University of the Republic]], and is located on [[Avenida Italia]]. It functions as an adult general polyclinic and hospital. The building was designed by architect Carlos Surraco in 1928–1929 and has a surface area of {{convert|110000|sqm|sqft|sp=us}} on 23 floors. The hospital was inaugurated 21 September 1953. For many years it was led by Dr. [[Hugo Villar]], who was a considerable influence on the institution.

[[Hospital Maciel]] is one of the oldest hospitals in Uruguay and stands on the block bounded by the streets Maciel, 25 de Mayo, Guaraní and Washington, with the main entrance at 25 de Mayo, 172. The land was originally donated in Spanish colonial times by philanthropist [[Francisco Antonio Maciel]], who teamed up with [[Mateo Vidal]] to establish a hospital and charity. The first building was constructed between 1781 and 1788 and later expanded upon.
