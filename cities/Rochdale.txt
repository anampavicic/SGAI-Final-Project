'''Rochdale''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɒ|tʃ|d|eɪ|l}} {{respell|ROTCH|dayl}}) is a town in [[Greater Manchester]], England, and the administrative centre of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer">{{cite web|url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/Guides/Gazeteer/gazzo2r.htm|title=Greater Manchester Gazetteer|publisher=Greater Manchester County Record Office|access-date=9 July 2007|at=Places names – O to R|archive-date=18 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718144358/http://www.gmcro.co.uk/Guides/Gazeteer/gazzo2r.htm}}</ref> In the 2021 census the town had a population of 111,261, compared to 223,773 for the wider borough.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rochdale (Greater Manchester, North West England, United Kingdom) – Population Statistics, Charts, Map, Location, Weather and Web Information |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/northwestengland/greater_manchester/E63001069__rochdale/ |access-date=23 June 2023 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=How the population changed in Rochdale, Census 2021 – ONS |url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/censuspopulationchange/E08000005/ |access-date=23 June 2023 |website=www.ons.gov.uk}}</ref> Rochdale is in the foothills of the [[South Pennines]] and lies in the [[Dale (landform)|dale]] (valley) of the [[River Roch]], {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} northwest of [[Oldham]], and {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} northeast of [[Manchester]].

Rochdale's [[recorded history]] begins with an entry in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as "Recedham Manor" but can be traced back to the 9th century. The [[Rochdale (ancient parish)|ancient parish of Rochdale]] was a division of the [[Salford Hundred]] and one of the larger ecclesiastical parishes in England, comprising several [[Township (England)|townships]]. By 1251, the town had become of such importance that it was granted a [[royal charter]].

The town became a centre of [[northern England]]'s [[woollen]]<!-- note UK spelling, do not "correct" --> trade, and by the early 18th century was described as being "remarkable for its many wealthy merchants".<ref name="Pocket Rochdale">{{cite book |last=Godman |first=Pam |title=Images of England: Rochdale |publisher=History Press Limited |year=1996 |isbn=1-84588-173-7}}</ref> In the 19th century it became a [[mill town]] and centre for [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]]. The town is historically within [[Lancashire]], and was a [[county borough]] within it before 1974.

==History==

===Toponymy===
The town is recorded as ''Recedham'' in the [[Domesday Book]] and ''Rachetham'' in 1193. Variations of ''Rechedham'' continue into the thirteenth century when the first element's termination is dropped as ''Rachedam'' became ''Racheham''. This change was soon followed with the suffix ''-ham'' (homestead) changing to ''-dale'' (wide valley).

''Rachdale'' is recorded as a name for the town in 1242, but may have been used earlier as a name for the valley, [[Hundred (county division)|Hundred]] and Parish.<ref name="mills">Mills, A.D.: ''A Dictionary of English Place Names'', 2nd Edition, page 289, s.n. Rochdale. Oxford University Press, 1998</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Ekwall |first1=Eilert |title=The Place-names of Lancashire |date=1922 |publisher=Manchester University Press |page=54 |url=https://archive.org/details/placenamesoflanc00ekwauoft/page/54/mode/2up}}</ref> The Domesday Book's rendering of the name led [[Eilert Ekwall]] to suggest a derivation from ''reced'', an obscure [[Old English]] element meaning "hall".

Although the name of the river is still pronounced {{IPAc-en|r|oʊ|tʃ}} (with a long vowel sound), Rochdale is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɒ|tʃ|d|eɪ|l}} (with a shorter ''o'' sound).

===Early history===
[[File:Arrow Mill.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Arrow Mill is a former [[cotton mill]] and Grade II [[listed building]] in [[Castleton, Greater Manchester|Castleton]]]]

A [[Roman roads|Roman road]], leading from [[Mamucium]] ([[Manchester]]) to [[Eboracum]] ([[York]]), crossed the moors at [[Blackstone Edge]].<ref name="tde">{{Citation|last=Lewis|first=Samuel|title=A Topographical Dictionary of England; 'Rixton&nbsp;– Rochford' |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=51241#s10 |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |year=1848 |pages=679–686}}</ref>

Rochdale was subjected to incursions by the [[Danes (tribe)|Danes]]; the castle that [[Castleton, Greater Manchester|Castleton]] is named after, and of which no trace remains, was one of twelve Saxon forts possibly destroyed in frequent conflicts that occurred between the Saxons and Danes during the 10th and 11th centuries.<ref name="tde"/> At the time of the [[Norman Conquest]] the manor was held by a Saxon [[thegn]], Gamel. Rochdale appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as ''Recedham'' and was described as lying within the hundred of Salford and the county of Cheshire. At that time, Rochdale was under the lordship of [[Roger the Poitevin]].<ref>*{{OpenDomesday|SD8913|rochdale|accessdate=23 October 2021}}</ref> Before 1212, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] granted the manor to [[Roger de Lacy (1170–1211)|Roger de Lacy]] whose family retained it as part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]] until it passed to the Dukes of Lancaster by marriage and then by 1399 to [[the Crown]].<ref name="tde" /><ref name="vch" /> In [[medieval]] times, weekly markets were held from 1250 when Edmund de Lacy obtained a grant for a market and an annual fair.<ref name="tde"/> The market was held outside the parish church where there was an "Orator's Corner".{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}

[[John Byron, 1st Baron Byron|John Byron]] bought the manor in 1638 and it was sold by the poet, [[Lord Byron]], in 1823, to the Deardens, who hold the title. Rochdale had no manor house but the "Orchard" built in 1702 and acquired in 1745 by Simon Dearden was the home of the lords of the manor after 1823. It was described as "a red-brick building of no architectural distinction, on the north side of the river opposite the town hall" and sometimes referred to as the Manor House. It was demolished in 1922.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.link4life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=c.showPage&pageID=993|title=War Memorial|publisher=Link4Life|access-date=28 December 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718192958/http://www.link4life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=c.showPage&pageID=993|archive-date=18 July 2011}}</ref>

===Industrial Revolution===
Rochdale is a product of the [[Industrial Revolution]],<ref>{{cite web |date=22 March 2019 |title=Chapter 8: Mill Towns Become Mill Cities |url=https://industrialrevolutionspod.com/episodes/2019/3/22/chapter-8-mill-towns-become-mill-cities |access-date=23 June 2023 |website=The Industrial Revolutions |language=en-US}}</ref> though the manufacture of woollen cloth, particularly [[baize]], [[Kersey (cloth)|kerseys]] and [[flannel]]s, was locally important as far back as the 1500s. At that time the textile industry was rooted in the [[Putting out system|domestic system]], but towards the end of the 18th century mills powered by water started to appear.

Water power was replaced by steam power in the 19th century and local coal became important. The Deardens who were lords of the manor were among the local coal mine owners.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.rochdale-on-line.com/heritage/mines.htm |title=Mines worked in Rochdale in 1896 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715193522/http://www.rochdale-on-line.com/heritage/mines.htm |archive-date=15 July 2011 |publisher=Rochdale Online |access-date=27 December 2010}}</ref> By the mid-1800s, the woollen trade was declining and the cotton trade was rapidly growing in importance.

During the 19th century, Rochdale became one of the world's most prominent cotton processing towns rising to prominence and becoming a major centre for [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]]. It was a [[boomtown]] of the Industrial Revolution, and amongst the first ever [[Industrialisation|industrialised]] towns.<ref name="GM Arch">{{cite book |author1=McNeil, R. |author2=Nevell, M |name-list-style=amp |title=A Guide to the Industrial Archaeology of Greater Manchester |publisher=Association for Industrial Archaeology |year=2000 |isbn=0-9528930-3-7}}</ref> By the end of the 19th century Rochdale had woollen mills, [[silk]] manufacturers, [[bleach]]ers and [[dye]]rs, though cotton spinning and weaving were the dominant industries in the community.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/wiki/Cotton_Mills_in_Rochdale_1891#Rochdale_.28p177.29|title=Cotton Mills in Rochdale 1891 |publisher=Grace's Guide |access-date=27 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Cartwright |first=Mark |title=The Textile Industry in the British Industrial Revolution |url=https://www.worldhistory.org/article/2183/the-textile-industry-in-the-british-industrial-rev/ |access-date=23 June 2023 |website=World History Encyclopedia}}</ref>

The [[socioeconomic]] change brought by the success of Rochdale's textile industry in the 19th century led to its rise to [[Municipal borough|borough status]] and it became an important regional town based upon this economic success.<ref name="GM Arch" />

===Decline of textile manufacturing===
By the middle of the 20th century, Rochdale's economy was in decline, reflecting the broader economic situation in other textile manufacturing towns in the [[North West England]]. This decline was largely driven by the global availability of cheaper textile product offerings from abroad.<ref name="iverpool">{{Cite web |title=Cotton in decline |url=https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/cotton-decline |access-date=23 June 2023 |website=National Museums Liverpool}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Toms |first=Steve |date=1998 |title=Growth, Profits and Technological Choice: The Case of the Lancashire Cotton Textile Industry |url=https://www.academia.edu/16447811 |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1738265 |s2cid=109573792 |issn=1556-5068}}</ref>

During the 1950s and 1960s Rochdale's lack of a diverse economic base became very apparent, with the closure of numerous textile manufacturing facilities.<ref>{{Cite web |title=BBC - Nation on Film - Decline of the cotton industry |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/nationonfilm/topics/textiles/background_decline.shtml#:~:text=During%20the%201960s%20and%2070s,once%20the%20pride%20of%20Britain. |access-date=23 June 2023 |website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Textile manufacturing did remain a major contributor to the local economy, even into the 1970s. Regionally, numerous companies still have some connection to the textile industry.<ref name="iverpool" />

Lying within the [[Historic counties of England|historic county boundaries]] of [[Lancashire]] [[History of Lancashire|since the early 12th century]], Rochdale was recorded in 1066 as held by Gamel, one of the twenty-one [[thegn]]s of the [[Salford (hundred)|Hundred of Salfordshire]].<ref name="vch">{{Citation|last1=Brownbill|first1=J|last2=Farrer|first2=William|title=A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 5|url = http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53027|publisher=Victoria County History|year=1911|pages=187–201}}</ref>

The ancient ecclesiastical [[Rochdale (ancient parish)|parish of Rochdale]] was divided into four townships: [[Butterworth (ancient township)|Butterworth]], [[Castleton, Greater Manchester|Castleton]], [[Hundersfield]] and [[Spotland]]. Hundersfield was later divided into four townships: Blatchinworth, [[Calderbrook]], [[Wardleworth]] and Wuerdle and Wardle.

Excluding the large [[chapelry]] of [[Saddleworth]], which lay entirely in [[Yorkshire]], the parish of Rochdale had an area of {{convert|65.4|sqmi|km2|1}}.<ref name="vch" />

In 1825, commissioners for the social and economic improvement of the town were established. The town became part of a [[parliamentary borough]] in 1832. As there were no existing township boundaries, the commissioners and later the parliamentary constituency were deemed to cover a circular area extending three-quarters of a mile from the old market-place.<ref name="vch" />

Under the terms of the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]], Rochdale became the head of Rochdale [[Poor Law Union]] which was established on 15 February 1837, despite considerable local opposition.<ref name="Workhouse">{{citation |url=http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?Rochdale/Rochdale.shtml |title=Rochdale Workhouse |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605224217/http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?Rochdale%2FRochdale.shtml |archive-date=5 June 2011 |publisher=The Workhouse |access-date=23 December 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1856 Rochdale was incorporated as a [[municipal borough]], giving it [[borough status in the United Kingdom]] and after 1858 it obtained the powers of the improvement commissioners.<ref name="GM Gazetteer" />

In 1872, the remaining area of Wardleworth township and parts of Castleton, Wuerdle and Wardle, Spotland and Butterworth townships were added to the borough.<ref name="GM Gazetteer" />

When the [[Administrative counties of England|administrative county]] of Lancashire was created by the [[Local Government Act 1888]], Rochdale was elevated to become the [[County Borough of Rochdale]] and was, in modern terms, a [[unitary authority]] area exempt from the administration of [[Lancashire County Council]]. In 1900, most of Castleton [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|Urban District]] was added to the borough; this [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] included parts of Castleton, Hopwood and [[Thornham, Greater Manchester|Thornham]] townships. In 1933, parts of Norden Urban District and Birtle with Bamford civil parish were added to the borough.<ref name="GM Gazetteer" />

Under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the town's autonomous [[county borough]] status was abolished. The municipal boroughs of [[Middleton, Greater Manchester|Middleton]] and [[Heywood, Greater Manchester|Heywood]] and [[Littleborough, Greater Manchester|Littleborough]], [[Milnrow]] and [[Wardle, Greater Manchester|Wardle]] urban districts are now part of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale]], one of the ten metropolitan boroughs in [[Greater Manchester]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer" />

Since 1953, Rochdale has been [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with [[Bielefeld]] in Germany and since 1956 with [[Tourcoing]] in France, as well as [[Sahiwal]] in Pakistan since 1988 and [[Lviv]] in Ukraine since 1992. Sahiwal council has received many gifts like fire brigade trucks, ambulances and grants for hospitals from the people of Rochdale.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rochdale.gov.uk/leisure_and_culture/tourism_and_travel/town_twinning.aspx |title=Town twinning |publisher=rochdale.gov.uk |access-date=1 March 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071029173635/http://www.rochdale.gov.uk/leisure_and_culture/libraries/town_twinning.aspx <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 29 October 2007}}</ref>

===Parliamentary representation===
The [[Rochdale (UK Parliament constituency)|Rochdale constituency]] was created by the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act of 1832]]. The constituency was held for two decades during the 20th century by [[Cyril Smith]], first of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] and then of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].<ref>{{Citation |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11180264|title=Former Liberal Democrat MP Cyril Smith dies|access-date=27 December 2010|date=3 September 2010|work=BBC News}}</ref>

Following the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], the town was represented by [[Simon Danczuk]], who was elected as a Labour MP but was subsequently suspended and under investigation by the Labour Party.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/12075637/MP-Simon-Danczuk-probed-by-police-after-sending-spanking-texts-to-teenager.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/12075637/MP-Simon-Danczuk-probed-by-police-after-sending-spanking-texts-to-teenager.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=MP Simon Danczuk suspended by Labour over 'spanking' texts to teenager|website=www.telegraph.co.uk|date=31 December 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

[[Tony Lloyd]] (Labour) was elected as MP for Rochdale constituency in the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], and represented the constituency until his death on 17 January 2024. The seat was won by [[George Galloway]], leader and founder of the [[Workers Party of Britain]], in the [[2024 Rochdale by-election]] on 29 February 2024, in a campaign that was dominated by opposition to British involvement in the [[Israel–Hamas war|Israel-Hamas war]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Halliday |first1=Josh |last2=Ahmed |first2=Aneesa |date=1 March 2024 |title='This is for Gaza': George Galloway sweeps to victory in Rochdale byelection |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/mar/01/george-galloway-wins-rochdale-byelection |access-date=3 March 2024 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Six months later Galloway was defeated in the [[2024 United Kingdom general election|2024 election]] by Labour MP [[Paul Waugh]].

==Geography==
{{further|Geography of Greater Manchester}}
Rochdale is approximately {{convert|450|ft|m|0}} above [[sea level]], {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} north-northeast of [[Manchester city centre]], in the [[valley]] of the [[River Roch]]. [[Blackstone Edge]], [[Saddleworth Moor]] and the [[South Pennines]] are close to the east, whilst on all other sides, Rochdale is bound by other towns, including [[Whitworth, Lancashire|Whitworth]], [[Littleborough, Greater Manchester|Littleborough]], [[Milnrow]], [[Royton]], [[Heywood, Greater Manchester|Heywood]] and [[Shaw and Crompton]], with little or no [[Open space reserve|green space]] between them.

Rochdale's [[built environment]] consists of a mixture of infrastructure, housing types and commercial buildings from a number of periods. Rochdale's housing stock is mixed, but has a significant amount of stone or red-brick [[terraced house]]s from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

[[Rochdale Town Hall|Rochdale's Town Hall]], seven large [[tower block]]s (locally nicknamed 'The Seven Sisters') and a number of former [[cotton mill]]s mark the town's skyline. The [[urban structure]] of Rochdale is regular when compared to most [[List of towns in England|towns in England]], its form restricted in places by its hilly upland terrain.

Much of Rochdale's [[built environment]] is centred around a [[central business district]] in the [[town centre]], which is the local centre of both the town and borough.

There is a mixture of high-density [[urban areas]], [[suburb]]s, semi-rural and [[rural]] locations in Rochdale, but overwhelmingly the [[land use]] in the town is urban.

For purposes of the [[Office for National Statistics]], the Borough of Rochdale forms the fifth largest settlement of the [[Greater Manchester Urban Area]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/census2001/ks_urban_north_part_5.pdf |title=Census 2001:Key Statistics for urban areas in the North; Map 3 |author=Office for National Statistics |author-link=Office for National Statistics |publisher=statistics.gov.uk |access-date=13 September 2007 |year=2001 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109141715/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/census2001/ks_urban_north_part_5.pdf |archive-date=9 January 2007 }}</ref> the [[List of conurbations in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom's third largest conurbation]].

The [[M62 motorway]] passes to the south and southwest of Rochdale. Two [[heavy rail]] lines enter Rochdale from the east, joining at [[Rochdale railway station]] before continuing southwards to the city of Manchester.

[[File:Town Hall and Cenotaph, Rochdale.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Rochdale Cenotaph]] stands before [[Rochdale Town Hall]] ]]
[[Rochdale Town Hall]] is a [[Victorian era]] [[town hall]] "widely recognized as being one of the finest municipal buildings in the country".<ref name="RMBC43">Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council, ''Metropolitan Rochdale Official Guide'', n.d., Ed. J. Burrow & Co., p. 43</ref> It is the ceremonial headquarters of [[Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale|Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council]] and houses local government departments, including the borough's [[civil registry|civil registration office]].

Built in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival style]] it was inaugurated on 27 September 1871. The architect, [[William Henry Crossland]], won a competition held in 1864. The town hall had a {{convert|240|ft|m|0|adj=on}} [[clock tower]] topped by a wooden spire with a gilded statue of [[Saint George and the Dragon]] which were destroyed by fire on 10 April 1883. A new {{convert|191|ft|m|0|adj=on}} stone clock tower and spire in the style of [[Manchester Town Hall]] was designed by [[Alfred Waterhouse]], and erected in 1888. Art critic [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] described the building as possessing a "rare picturesque beauty".<ref name="Pevsner 59">{{harvnb|Hartwell|Hyde|Pevsner|2004|p=59.}}</ref> Its [[stained glass]] windows, some designed by [[William Morris]], are credited as "the finest modern examples of their kind".<ref name="RMBC43" />{{failed verification|date=June 2023|reason=Reference doesn't go anywhere}} It has been described as one of the United Kingdom's finest examples of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Gothic revival]] architecture.<ref name=NP>{{Cite book| last = Cunningham| first = C | title = Victorian & Edwardian Town Halls | year = 1981 | publisher = Routeledge | location = London }}</ref>

The building came to the attention of [[Adolf Hitler]] who was said to have admired it so much that he wished to ship the building, brick-by-brick, to [[Nazi Germany]] had the United Kingdom been defeated in the [[Second World War]].<ref name="hit1">{{cite news|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/rochdaleobserver/news/s/518474_amazing_windows_always_a_glass_act.html|title=Amazing windows always a glass act|publisher=M.E.N.

The [[Rochdale Cenotaph]], a war memorial bearing four sculpted and painted flags, is located opposite the town hall. It commemorates those who died in conflicts since the [[First World War]]. The monument and surrounding gardens were designed by [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]].<ref>Rochdale Official Guide (3rd edition); Pyramid Press; London; 1952</ref><ref>Hartwell, C., (2004), ''Buildings of South Lancashire'', p.&nbsp;595.</ref> Rochdale’s cenotaph is one of eight designed by Lutyens in England. The earliest to be erected was at [[Southampton Cenotaph|Southampton]] in 1920; the last at [[Norwich War Memorial|Norwich]], in 1927. The monument is made from Cornish granite and sits on the site of a building known as Manor House, which was used as a recruiting station during World War I. The cenotaph was built by Hobson Ltd of Nottingham at a cost of £12,611. It was unveiled by the Earl of Derby on 26 November 1922 and dedicated by the Archdeacon of Rochdale. It is about 10m tall and the top section is a [[catafalque]], which includes a carving of a horizontal figure.
[[File:Rochdale Town Hall and Gracie Fields statue.jpg|thumb|The Dame Gracie Fields statue outside Rochdale Town Hall]]
Adjacent to the town hall is a statue of the late singer, comedian and actress [[Gracie Fields|Dame Gracie Fields]]. The statue was unveiled by [[Roy Hudd]] on Sunday 18 September 2016. It was created by sculptor [[Sean Hedges-Quinn]], who based the statue on Fields's look during the 1940s.<ref>{{Cite web |title=GRACIE FIELDS |url=https://statuesforequality.com/pages/gracie-fields |access-date=2024-09-20 |website=Statues For Equality |language=en}}</ref> The statue was the first of a woman to be unveiled in Greater Manchester in more than 100 years<ref>{{Cite news |last=Halliday |first=Josh |last2=correspondent |first2=Josh Halliday North of England |date=2016-09-19 |title='Our Gracie' comes home: Rochdale salutes Gracie Fields with statue |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/19/our-gracie-comes-home-rochdale-salutes-gracie-fields-with-statue |access-date=2024-09-20 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> and was part of the [[Rochdale Borough Council|council's]] wider regeneration of the town centre.

In Broadfield Park in the town centre there is a statue of [[John Bright]] MP, a British [[Radicals (UK)|Radical]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] statesman, who is regarded as one of the greatest orators of his generation and a promoter of [[free trade]] policies. Bright was born in Rochdale and became famous for his crusade to repeal Britain's [[Corn Laws|corn laws]] and his promotion of religious freedom and [[electoral reform]]. 

Worthy of note is a large industrial park, named the [[Kingsway Business Park]] for which planning permission for its construction began in 2009. The complex covers an area of {{convert|420|acre|sqmi sqkm}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rochdaleonline.co.uk/news-features/1/business-news/40792/jd-sports-signs-deal-for-largest-warehouse-on-kingsway-business-park|title=JD Sports signs deal for largest warehouse on Kingsway Business Park|website=www.rochdaleonline.co.uk|access-date=14 February 2020}}</ref>

==Transport==
[[Public transport]] in Rochdale is coordinated by [[Transport for Greater Manchester]] (TfGM), who owns the bus station and coordinates transport services in the area.

===Road===
The earliest routes around Rochdale were tracks and [[packhorse]] routes and a paved track over Blackstone Edge into [[Yorkshire]] that had Roman origins.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.transportheritage.com/find-heritage-locations.html?sobi2Task=sobi2Details&catid=61&sobi2Id=270|title=Blackstone Edge Roman Road|publisher= Transport Trust|access-date=23 December 2010}}</ref> As trade increased the Blackstone Edge [[Turnpike trust|turnpike]] road was built in 1735.

The [[M62 motorway]] to the south of the town is accessed via the [[A627(M) motorway|A627(M)]], which starts at Sandbrook Park in Rochdale and runs to Elk Mill in [[Chadderton]]. The A627(M) provides access to the M62 and to Oldham.

===Rochdale Canal===
The idea for the [[Rochdale Canal]] emerged in 1776, when [[James Brindley]] was commissioned to survey possible routes between [[Sowerby Bridge]] and Manchester.

However it was not until 4 April 1794 that an Act of Parliament was obtained. The broad canal which linked the [[Bridgewater Canal]] in Manchester with the [[Aire and Calder Navigation]] at Sowerby Bridge became a major artery of commerce between Lancashire and Yorkshire for cotton, wool, coal, limestone, timber, and salt.<ref name="PW">{{Citation |url=http://www.penninewaterways.co.uk/rochdale/rc2.htm|title=History of the Rochdale Canal|publisher= Pennine Waterways|access-date=23 December 2010}}</ref> The [[Rochdale Canal]] has the highest concentration of canal locks in the regional northern canal system; it houses 91 locks over {{convert|32|mi}}.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rochdale Canal {{!}} Canal & River Trust |url=https://canalrivertrust.org.uk/enjoy-the-waterways/canal-and-river-network/rochdale-canal |access-date=2023-06-24 |website=canalrivertrust.org.uk |language=en}}</ref>

[[Hollingworth Lake]] is part of the canal system, the lake was originally designed to regulate water levels and was part of the original engineering initiative. By the 1950s, the canal had fallen into general disuse and was abandoned in the 1960s along with many other industrial areas that had supported traditional industries. The lower section from the Bridgewater Canal to the junction with the [[Ashton Canal]] was restored as part of the [[Cheshire Ring]] in 1974. The rest of the canal was restored and re-opened in 2003. Local activist groups have worked to improve the canal further.

===Rail and Metrolink===
[[File:Rochdale Railway Station Metrolink stop.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]] stop at [[Rochdale railway station]]]]
Demand from the cross-Pennine trade to support local [[cotton]], [[wool]] and [[silk]] industries led to the building of the [[Manchester and Leeds Railway]] which opened in 1839 from Manchester to [[Littleborough, Greater Manchester|Littleborough]], and from [[Normanton, West Yorkshire|Normanton]] to [[Hebden Bridge]] in 1840.

The linking section opened on completion of the [[Summit Tunnel]] in 1841. [[Rochdale railway station]] is about a mile south of the town centre. Trains run to [[Manchester Victoria railway station|Manchester Victoria]], [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], [[Dewsbury]], [[Bradford]] and [[Leeds]]. A new service to [[Burnley]] and [[Accrington]] commenced in 2015.

The service to Manchester Victoria on the [[Oldham Loop line]] ended in October 2009, in preparation for conversion of the line to an extension of the [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]] light rail system, renamed as the [[Oldham and Rochdale Line]].

It was deferred in 2004 on grounds of cost but in July 2006 plans were approved for the extension from Manchester Victoria as far as Rochdale railway station, and opened on 28 February 2013.

The extension to Rochdale town centre, via Drake Street and terminating opposite [[Rochdale Interchange]] opened on 31 March 2014.

===Bus===
Until 1969, the borough's bus service was provided by the municipal operator Rochdale Corporation Transport which was merged into the [[Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive|SELNEC Passenger Transport Executive]]. Rochdale's old bus station closed in November 2013 and was demolished in April 2014 along with the [[multi-storey car park]] and municipal offices (known locally as 'The Black Box'), to make way for the new Rochdale Riverside retail and leisure development.<ref>{{ cite web | title=Rochdale Town Centre Demolitions | url=http://www.rochdaletowncentre.com/home/Developments/demolitions | year=2014 | access-date=20 August 2014 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821071849/http://www.rochdaletowncentre.com/home/Developments/demolitions | archive-date=21 August 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The replacement [[Rochdale Interchange]] is located next to the council office and main library building [[Number One Riverside]] and is linked with [[Rochdale Town Centre tram stop]].

There are frequent bus services from Rochdale, operated by [[First Greater Manchester]], to Middleton, Royton, Chadderton, Oldham, Ashton-under-Lyne, Bury and Bolton. Frequent services to Manchester city centre are provided by First Greater Manchester's [[Greater Manchester bus route 17|route 17]] overground service.

There are cross-county services into Lancashire, West Yorkshire and Littleborough provided by [[Rosso (bus company)|Rosso]], who operates to Rawtenstall and Accrington, [[First West Yorkshire]], which operates to Burnley and Halifax, both via Todmorden, while the service to Halifax via Ripponden is operated by [[Team Pennine]].
