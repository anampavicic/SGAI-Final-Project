'''Bucharest''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˌ|b|uː|k|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|s|t}} {{respell|BOO|kə|REST}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|b|uː|k|ə|r|ɛ|s|t}} {{respell|-|rest}}; {{langx|ro|București}} {{IPA|ro|bukuˈreʃtʲ||Ro-București.ogg}}) is the capital and largest city of [[Romania]]. The metropolis stands on the River [[Dâmbovița (river)|Dâmbovița]] in south-eastern Romania. Its population is officially estimated at 1.76 million residents within a greater [[Bucharest metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] of 2.3 million residents, which makes Bucharest the [[List of cities in the European Union by population within city limits|8th most-populous city]] in the [[European Union]]. The city area measures {{cvt|240|km2}} and comprises 6 districts (''[[Sectors of Bucharest|Sectoare]]''), while the metropolitan area covers {{cvt|1811|km2}}. Bucharest is a beta [[global city]], a major cultural, political and economic hub, and the country's seat of government.

Bucharest was first mentioned in documents in 1459. The city became the capital in 1862 and is the centre of Romanian media, culture, and art. Its architecture is a mix of historical (mostly [[History of architecture#Revivalism and Eclecticism|Eclectic]], but also [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] and [[Art Nouveau architecture|Art Nouveau]]), [[interbellum]] ([[Bauhaus]], [[Art Deco]], and [[Romanian Revival architecture]]), [[Socialist realism|socialist era]], and [[Modern architecture|modern]]. In the period between the two World Wars, the city's elegant architecture and the sophistication of its elite earned Bucharest the nicknames of Little Paris ({{langx|ro|Micul Paris}}) or [[Paris of the East (disambiguation)|Paris of the East]] ({{langx|ro|Parisul Estului}}).<ref>[http://museum.ici.ro/mbucur/english/micparis.htm Bucharest, the small Paris of the East] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221002454/http://museum.ici.ro/mbucur/english/micparis.htm |date=21 February 2006 }}, on the Museums from Romania web site.</ref> Although buildings and districts in the historic city centre were heavily damaged or destroyed by war, earthquakes, and even [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]'s program of [[systematization (Romania)|systematization]], many survived and have been renovated.

== Etymology ==
The Romanian name {{lang|ro|București}} has an unverified origin. Tradition connects the founding of Bucharest with the name of ''[[Bucur (legendary shepherd)|Bucur]]'', who was a prince, an outlaw, a fisherman, a shepherd or a hunter, according to different legends. In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], the word stem {{lang|ro|bucurie}} means 'joy' ('happiness'),<ref>Rosetti, II. p.110</ref>  hence the city Bucharest means 'city of joy'.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cutler|first=Nellie|date=2011|chapter=Southeastern Europe|title=Time for Kids World Atlas|edition=Rev. and updated|publisher=[[Time for Kids]] Books|location=New York, NY|page=68|isbn=978-1-60320-884-0}}</ref>

Other etymologies are given by early scholars, including the one of an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] traveller, [[Evliya Çelebi]], who claimed that Bucharest was named after a certain 'Abu-Kariș', from the tribe of '[[Banu Quraysh|Bani-Kureiș]]'. In 1781, [[Austrians|Austrian]] historian Franz Sulzer claimed that it was related to ''bucurie'' (joy), ''bucuros'' (joyful), or ''a se bucura'' (to be joyful), while an early 19th-century book published in [[Vienna]] assumed its name to be derived from 'Bukovie', a [[beech]] forest.<ref name=Georgescu77>Georgescu et al., p.76-77</ref> In [[English language|English]], the city's name was formerly rendered as ''Bukarest''. <!-- repeat The full official city name is "The Municipality of Bucharest" ({{langx|ro|Municipiul București}}). -->A native or resident of Bucharest is called a 'Bucharester' (Romanian: {{lang|ro|bucureștean}}).

Bucharest's history alternated periods of development and decline from the early settlements in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] until its consolidation as the national capital of [[Romania]] late in the 19th century. First mentioned as the '[[Citadel]] of București' in 1459, it became the residence of the ruler of Wallachia, Voivode [[Vlad the Impaler]].<ref name=Giurescu>{{cite book|first=Constantin C.|last= Giurescu|author-link= Constantin C. Giurescu|year=1976|title= History of Bucharest|location= Bucharest|publisher=The Publishing House for Sports and Tourism}}</ref>{{rp|23}}

The [[Curtea Veche|Old Princely Court]] (''Curtea Veche'') was erected by [[Mircea Ciobanul]] in the mid-16th century. Under subsequent rulers, Bucharest was established as the summer residence of the royal court. During the years to come, it competed with [[Târgoviște]] on the status of capital city after an increase in the importance of Southern [[Muntenia]] brought about by the demands of the [[suzerainty|''suzerain'']] power – the [[Ottoman Empire]].

Bucharest finally became the permanent location of the Wallachian court after 1698 (starting with the reign of [[Constantin Brâncoveanu]]). The city was partly destroyed by natural disasters and rebuilt several times during the following 200 years.

The Ottomans appointed Greek administrators ([[Phanariotes]]) to run the town ({{Langx|ota|بكرش|translit=Bukreş}}<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.osmanlicasozlukler.com/kamusulalam/tafsil-8131-me9.html|title=Kamus'ul Alam|last=Semseddin|first=Sâmî|year=1898|volume=2|location=Istanbul|pages=533|chapter=بكرش|author-link=Sami Frashëri}}</ref>) from the 18th century. The [[Wallachian uprising of 1821|1821 Wallachian uprising]] initiated by [[Tudor Vladimirescu]] led to the end of the rule of Constantinople Greeks in Bucharest.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Între Orient și Occident. Țările române la începutul epocii moderne (1800–1848)|last = Djuvara|first = Neagu|publisher = Humanitas|year = 2013|isbn = 978-973-50-4083-3}}</ref>

In 1813–14 the city was hit by [[Caragea's plague]]. The city was wrested from Ottoman influence and occupied at several intervals by the [[Habsburg monarchy]] (1716, 1737, 1789) and [[Imperial Russia]] (three times between 1768 and 1806). It was placed under [[Regulamentul Organic|Russian administration]] between 1828 and the [[Crimean War]], with an interlude during the Bucharest-centred [[1848 Wallachian revolution]]. Later, an [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] garrison took possession after the Russian departure (remaining in the city until March 1857). On 23 March 1847, a fire consumed about 2,000 buildings, destroying a third of the city.

In 1862, after [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] were united to form the [[United Principalities|Principality of Romania]], Bucharest became the new nation's capital city. In 1881, it became the political centre of the newly proclaimed [[Kingdom of Romania]] under King [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]]. During the second half of the 19th century, the city's population increased dramatically, and a new period of urban development began. During this period, [[gas lighting]], [[Horsecar|horse-drawn trams]], and limited [[electrification]] were introduced.<ref>Giurescu, p.154-161, 169–171</ref> The Dâmbovița River was also massively channelled in 1883, thus putting a stop to previously endemic floods like the [[1865 flooding of Bucharest]].<ref>Giurescu, p.157, 161, 163</ref> The [[Fortifications of Bucharest]] were built. The extravagant architecture and cosmopolitan high culture of this period won Bucharest the nickname of 'Paris of the East' (''Parisul Estului''), with the [[Calea Victoriei]] as its [[Champs-Élysées]].

Between 6 December 1916 and November 1918, the city was occupied by [[German Empire|German]] forces as a result of the [[Battle of Bucharest]], with the official capital temporarily moved to [[Iași]] (also called Jassy), in the Moldavia region. After World War I, Bucharest became the capital of [[Greater Romania]]. In the interwar years, Bucharest's urban development continued, with the city gaining an average of 30,000 new residents each year. Also, some of the city's main landmarks were built in this period, including [[Arcul de Triumf]] and [[Palatul Telefoanelor]].<ref>Giurescu, p.191-195</ref> However, the [[Great Depression in Romania]] took its toll on Bucharest's citizens, culminating in the [[Grivița Strike of 1933]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/integral_tradition/irongua.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025083507/http://www.geocities.com/integral_tradition/irongua.html|archive-date=25 October 2009 |url-status=dead|title=Data |website=geocities.com}}</ref>

In January 1941, the city was the scene of the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom]]. As the capital of an [[Axis Powers|Axis]] country and a major transit point for Axis troops en route to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], Bucharest suffered heavy damage during World War II due to [[Bombing of Bucharest in World War II|Allied bombings]]. On 23 August 1944, Bucharest was the site of [[Romania during World War II#The royal coup|the royal coup]] which brought Romania into the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] camp. The city suffered a short period of Nazi [[Luftwaffe]] bombings, as well as a failed attempt by German troops to regain the city.
[[File:Curtea Veche 1.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|The [[Curtea Veche|Old Princely Court]] (''Curtea Veche''), the former residence of ruler [[Vlad the Impaler]], is located in the [[Bucharest Old Town|Old Town]].]]
After the establishment of [[Communist Romania|communism in Romania]], the city continued growing. New districts were constructed, most of them dominated by [[tower block]]s. During [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]'s leadership (1965–89), a part of the historic city [[Ceaușima|was demolished]] and replaced by '[[Socialist realism]]' style development: (1) the [[Centrul Civic]] (the Civic Centre) and (2) the [[Palace of the Parliament]], for which an entire historic quarter was razed to make way for Ceaușescu's megalomaniac plans. On 4 March 1977, an [[1977 Vrancea earthquake|earthquake centred in Vrancea]], about {{convert|135|km|2|abbr=on}} away, claimed 1,500 lives and caused further damage to the historic centre.

The [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]] began with massive anti-Ceaușescu protests in [[Timișoara]] in December 1989 and continued in Bucharest, leading to the overthrow of the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]]. Dissatisfied with the postrevolutionary leadership of the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]], some student leagues and opposition groups organised anti-Communist rallies in early 1990, which caused the political change.

Since 2000, the city has been continuously modernised. Residential and commercial developments are underway, particularly in the northern districts; Bucharest's old historic centre has undergone restoration since the mid-2000s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-tenants-of-the-old-town/ |title=The Tenants of the Old Town |work=Los Angeles Review of Books |last=Grama |first=Emanuela |date=1 September 2021 |access-date=21 April 2022}}</ref>

In 2015, 64 people were killed in the [[Colectiv nightclub fire]]. Later the Romanian capital saw the [[2017–2019 Romanian protests]] against the judicial reforms,<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-romania-protests/thousands-of-romanians-rally-against-ruling-partys-judicial-overhaul-idUSKBN1DQ0T3|title = Thousands of Romanians rally against ruling party's judicial overhaul|newspaper = Reuters|date = 26 November 2017|access-date = 15 August 2018|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180816061556/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-romania-protests/thousands-of-romanians-rally-against-ruling-partys-judicial-overhaul-idUSKBN1DQ0T3|archive-date = 16 August 2018|url-status = live}}</ref> with a 2018 protest ending with 450 people injured.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.dw.com/en/romania-tens-of-thousands-protest-for-second-night-running/a-45049450 | title=Romania: Tens of thousands protest for second night running &#124; DW &#124; 12 August 2018 | website=[[Deutsche Welle]] | access-date=15 August 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180812175803/https://www.dw.com/en/romania-tens-of-thousands-protest-for-second-night-running/a-45049450 | archive-date=12 August 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Treaties ===
The following treaties were signed in the city:
* [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)]], between the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire ending the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)]]
* [[Treaty of Bucharest (1886)]], between Serbia and Bulgaria ending the [[Serbo-Bulgarian War|Serbian–Bulgarian War]]

=== General ===
[[File:Bucuresti de sus.jpg|thumb|right|Bucharest is [[Romania]]'s capital and largest city.]]

The city is situated on the banks of the [[Dâmbovița River]], which flows into the Argeș River, a tributary of the Danube. [[List of lakes in Bucharest|Several lakes]]{{spaced ndash}}the most important of which are Lake Herăstrău, Lake Floreasca, Lake Tei, and Lake Colentina{{spaced ndash}}stretch across the northern parts of the city, along the [[Colentina (river)|Colentina River]], a tributary of the Dâmbovița. In addition, in the centre of the capital is a small artificial lake{{spaced ndash}}Lake Cișmigiu{{spaced ndash}}surrounded by the [[Cișmigiu Gardens]]. These gardens have a rich history, having been frequented by poets and writers. Opened in 1847 and based on the plans of German architect Carl F.W. Meyer, the gardens are the main recreational facility in the city centre.

Bucharest parks and gardens also include [[King Michael I Park|Herăstrău Park]], [[Tineretului Park]] and the [[Botanical Garden of Bucharest|Botanical Garden]]. Herăstrău Park is located in the northern part of the city, around Lake Herăstrău, and includes the site the [[Dimitrie Gusti National Village Museum|Village Museum]]. [[Grigore Antipa National Museum of Natural History|Grigore Antipa Museum]] is also near in the Victoriei Square. One of its best known locations are [[Hard Rock Cafe]] Bucharest and [[Berăria H]] (one of the largest beer halls in Europe). Tineretului Park was created in 1965 and designed as the main recreational space for southern Bucharest. It contains a Mini Town which is a play area for kids. The Botanical Garden, located in the [[Cotroceni]] neighbourhood a bit west of the city centre, is the largest of its kind in Romania and contains over 10,000 species of plants (many of them exotic); it originated as the pleasure park of the royal family.<ref>[http://www.onlinegallery.ro/gradina_bot_bucurestie.html Botanical Garden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929164505/http://onlinegallery.ro/gradina_bot_bucurestie.html |date=29 September 2006 }}, onlinegallery.ro.

Alexandru Ioan Cuza Park, Kiseleff Park, [[Carol Park]], Izvor Park, [[Grădina Icoanei]], Circului Park and Moghioroș Park are a few of them. Other large parks in Bucharest are: National Park, Tei Park, Eroilor Park and Crângași Park with [[Lacul Morii|Morii Lake]].

[[Lake Văcărești]] is located in the southern part of the city. Over 190 hectares, including 90 hectares of water, host 97 species of birds, half of them protected by law, and at least seven species of mammals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-mediu-20841205-fotogalerie-cum-afectata-fauna-din-delta-vacaresti-incendii-distrugeri-dureaza-atat-mult-protejarea-zonei.htm|title=Fotogalerie – Cum e afectata fauna din Delta Vacaresti de incendii si distrugeri si de ce dureaza atat de mult protejarea zonei|website=[[HotNews]]|access-date=20 May 2016|date=3 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512043647/http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-mediu-20841205-fotogalerie-cum-afectata-fauna-din-delta-vacaresti-incendii-distrugeri-dureaza-atat-mult-protejarea-zonei.htm|archive-date=12 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The lake is surrounded by buildings of flats and is an odd result of human intervention and nature taking its course.

Bucharest is situated in the center of the Romanian Plain, in an area once covered by the Vlăsiei Forest, which after it was cleared, gave way for a fertile flatland. As with many cities, Bucharest is traditionally considered to be built upon seven hills, similar to the seven hills of Rome. Bucharest's seven hills are: Mihai Vodă, [[Dealul Mitropoliei]], Radu Vodă, [[Cotroceni]], [[Dealul Spirii]], [[Văcărești, Bucharest|Văcărești]], and Sfântu Gheorghe Nou.

The city has an area of {{convert|226|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. The altitude varies from {{convert|55.8|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} at the Dâmbovița bridge in Cățelu, southeastern Bucharest and {{convert|91.5|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} at the [[Militari]] church. The city has a roughly round shape, with the centre situated in the cross-way of the main north–south/east-west axes at [[University Square, Bucharest|University Square]]. The milestone for Romania's [[Kilometre Zero (Bucharest)|Kilometre Zero]] is placed just south of University Square in front of the New St. George Church (Sfântul Gheorghe Nou) at St. George Square (Piața Sfântul Gheorghe). Bucharest's radius, from University Square to the city limits in all directions, varies from  {{convert|10|to|12|km|0|abbr=on}}.

Until recently, the regions surrounding Bucharest were largely rural, but after 1989, suburbs started to be built around Bucharest, in the surrounding [[Ilfov County]]. This [[Counties of Romania|county]], which has experienced rapid demographic growth in the 21st century, being the fastest growing Romanian county between 2011 and 2021, had a population of 542,686 people at the [[2021 Romanian census]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.economica.net/recensamant-2022-singurele-judete-in-care-a-crescut-populatia-rezidenta-in-2021-fata-de-nivelul-din-2011-sunt-ilfov-bistrita-nasaud-si-suceava_637632.html | title=Recensământ 2022: Singurele judeţe în care a crescut populaţia rezidentă în 2021 faţă de nivelul din 2011 sunt Ilfov, Bistriţa-Năsăud şi Suceava | date=30 December 2022 }}</ref> In the 21st century, many of Ilfov county's villages and communes developed into high-income [[commuter town]]s, which act like suburbs or satellites of Bucharest.

== Climate ==

Bucharest has a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa'' by the 0&nbsp;°C isotherm), or a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa'' by the -3&nbsp;°C isotherm), with hot, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. Owing to its position on the Romanian Plain, the city's winters can get windy, though some of the winds are mitigated due to urbanisation. Winter temperatures often dip below {{convert|0|°C}}, sometimes even to {{convert|-10|°C}}. In summer, the average high temperature is {{convert|29.8|°C}} (the average for July and August). Temperatures frequently reach {{convert|35|to|40|°C|°F}} in midsummer in the city centre. Although average [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] in summer is moderate, occasional heavy storms occur. During spring and autumn, daytime temperatures vary between {{convert|17|and|22|°C|°F}}, and precipitation during spring tends to be higher than in summer, with more frequent yet milder periods of rain.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sfetcu|first=Nicolae|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90TrCgAAQBAJ&q=Bucurestiul+are+un+climat+de+tranzi%C8%9Bie,+cu+influen%C8%9Be+at%C3%A2t+continentale+c%C3%A2t+%C5%9Fi+%C8%99i+subtropicale+(clasificarea+climatic%C4%83+Koppen+Cfa+/+Dfa+/+Cfb+/+Dfb).&pg=PT23|title=Bucharest Tourist Guide (Ghid turistic București): Pocket Edition (Ediția de buzunar)|date=14 November 2015|publisher=Nicolae Sfetcu|language=en|access-date=29 May 2021|archive-date=29 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210529151215/https://books.google.com/books?id=90TrCgAAQBAJ&q=Bucurestiul+are+un+climat+de+tranzi%C8%9Bie%2C+cu+influen%C8%9Be+at%C3%A2t+continentale+c%C3%A2t+%C5%9Fi+%C8%99i+subtropicale+%28clasificarea+climatic%C4%83+Koppen+Cfa+%2F+Dfa+%2F+Cfb+%2F+Dfb%29.&pg=PT23|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=2451&cityname=Bucharest,+Romania|title=Bucharest, Romania Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=24 March 2020|archive-date=2 December 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201202154622/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=2451&cityname=Bucharest,+Romania|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Government ==

=== Administration ===
{{See also|Bucharest metropolitan area}}

Bucharest has a unique status in Romanian administration, since it is the only municipal area that is not part of a [[counties of Romania|county]]. Its population, however, is larger than that of any other [[List of Romanian counties by population|Romanian county]], hence the power of the Bucharest General Municipality (''Primăria Generală''), which is the capital's local government body, is the same as any other Romanian county council.

The Municipality of Bucharest, along with the surrounding Ilfov County, is part of the București – Ilfov development region project, which is equivalent to [[NUTS-II]] regions in the European Union and is used both by the EU and the Romanian government for statistical analysis, and to co-ordinate regional development projects and manage funds from the EU. The Bucharest-Ilfov development region is not, however, an administrative entity yet.
[[File:Bucureşti sectoare.svg|thumb|[[Sectors of Bucharest]]]]
The city government is headed by a [[Mayor of Bucharest|general mayor]] (''Primar General''). Since 29 October 2020 onwards, it is [[Nicușor Dan]], currently an independent politician previously backed by the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|PNL]]-[[2020 USR-PLUS Alliance|USR PLUS]] centre-right alliance at the [[2020 Romanian local elections]]. Decisions are approved and discussed by the capital's [[General Council of Bucharest|General Council]] (''Consiliu General'') made up of 55 elected councilors. Furthermore, the city is divided into six administrative [[Sectors of Bucharest|sectors]] (''sectoare''), each of which has its own 27-seat sectoral council, town hall, and mayor. The powers of the local government over a certain area are, therefore, shared both by the Bucharest municipality and the local sectoral councils with little or no overlapping of authority. The general rule is that the main capital municipality is responsible for citywide utilities such as the water and sewage system, the overall transport system, and the main boulevards, while sectoral town halls manage the contact between individuals and the local government, secondary streets and parks maintenance, schools administration, and cleaning services.

The six sectors are numbered from one to six and are disposed radially so that each one has under its administration a certain area of the city centre. They are numbered clockwise and are further divided into sectoral quarters (''cartiere'') which are not part of the official administrative division:
*'''[[Sector 1 (Bucharest)|Sector 1]]''' (population 227,717): [[Dorobanți]], [[Băneasa]], [[Aviației]], [[Pipera]], Aviatorilor, Primăverii, Romană, Victoriei, [[Herăstrău Park]], [[Bucureștii Noi]], Dămăroaia, Străulești, [[Grivița]], 1 Mai, [[Băneasa Forest]], Pajura, Domenii, Chibrit
*'''[[Sector 2 (Bucharest)|Sector 2]]''' (population 357,338): [[Pantelimon, Bucharest|Pantelimon]], [[Colentina, Bucharest|Colentina]], [[Iancului]], [[Tei, Bucharest|Tei]], [[Floreasca]], [[Moșilor]], [[Obor]], Vatra Luminoasă, Fundeni, Plumbuita, Ștefan cel Mare, Baicului
*'''[[Sector 3 (Bucharest)|Sector 3]]''' (population 399,231): [[Vitan, Bucharest|Vitan]], [[Dudești, Bucharest|Dudești]], [[Titan, Bucharest|Titan]], [[Centrul Civic]], [[Dristor]], [[Lipscani]], Muncii, Unirii
*'''[[Sector 4 (Bucharest)|Sector 4]]''' (population 300,331): [[Berceni, Bucharest|Berceni]], [[Olteniței]], [[Giurgiului]], [[Progresul]], [[Văcărești, Bucharest|Văcărești]], Timpuri Noi, Tineretului
*'''[[Sector 5 (Bucharest)|Sector 5]]''' (population 288,690): [[Rahova]], [[Ferentari]], [[Giurgiului]], [[Cotroceni]], 13 Septembrie, Dealul Spirii
*'''[[Sector 6 (Bucharest)|Sector 6]]''' (population 371,060): [[Giulești]], [[Crângași]], [[Drumul Taberei]], [[Militari]], Grozăvești (also known as Regie), [[Ghencea]]

Each sector is governed by a local mayor, as follows: Sector 1 – [[Clotilde Armand]] ([[Save Romania Union|USR]], since 2020), Sector 2 – Radu Mihaiu ([[Save Romania Union|USR]], since 2020), Sector 3 – [[Robert Negoiță]] (PRO B, since 2012), Sector 4 – Daniel Băluță ([[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|PSD]], since 2016), Sector 5 – Vlad Popescu Piedone (former mayor [[Cristian Popescu Piedone|Cristian Popescu Piedone's]] son) (PUSL, since 2024),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://jurnalul.ro/stiri/observator/marian-vanghelie-suspendat-din-functia-de-primar-al-sectorului-5-cine-ii-va-prelua-atributiile-686747.html |title=Marian Vanghelie, suspendat din funcția de primar al sectorului 5.

Like all other local councils in Romania, the Bucharest sectoral councils, the capital's [[General Council of Bucharest|general council]], and the mayors are elected every four years by the population. Additionally, Bucharest has a [[Prefect (Romania)|prefect]], who is appointed by Romania's national government. The prefect is not allowed to be a member of a political party and his role is to represent the national government at the municipal level. The prefect is acting as a liaison official facilitating the implementation of national development plans and governing programs at local level. The prefect of Bucharest (as of 2024) is Mihai Mugur Toader.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020|title=Conducere |publisher=Prefectul Municipiului București|url=https://b.prefectura.mai.gov.ro/acasa/despre-noi/conducere/|language=ro|access-date=9 October 2021|archive-date=31 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031082616/https://b.prefectura.mai.gov.ro/despre-noi/conducere/|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Justice system ===
[[File:Bucharest - Palace of Justice (Justizpalast) - no filter (29340923631).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Palace of Justice, Bucharest|Palace of Justice]] seen across the [[Dâmbovița (river)|Dâmbovița River]] in 2016]]

Bucharest's judicial system is similar to that of the Romanian counties. Each of the six sectors has its own local first-instance court (''judecătorie''), while more serious cases are directed to the Bucharest Tribunal (''Tribunalul Bucureşti''), the city's municipal court. The [[Bucharest Court of Appeal]] (''Curtea de Apel Bucureşti'') judges appeals against decisions taken by first-instance courts and tribunals in Bucharest and in five surrounding counties (Teleorman, Ialomița, Giurgiu, Călărași, and Ilfov). Bucharest is also home to Romania's supreme court, the [[High Court of Cassation and Justice]], as well as to the [[Constitutional Court of Romania]].

Bucharest has a municipal police force, the Bucharest Police (''Poliția București''), which is responsible for policing crime within the whole city, and operates a number of divisions. The Bucharest Police are headquartered on Ștefan cel Mare Blvd. in the city centre, and at precincts throughout the city. From 2004 onwards, each sector city hall also has under its administration a community police force (''[[Poliția Comunitară]]''), dealing with local community issues. Bucharest also houses the general inspectorates of the [[Gendarmerie (Romania)|''Gendarmerie'']] and the [[Romanian Police|national police]].

=== Crime ===

Bucharest's crime rate is rather low in comparison to other European capital cities, with the number of total offences declining by 51% between 2000 and 2004,<ref name="crimestats">[http://b.politiaromana.ro/index.php?pag=statistica_2000_2004_ro&limba=romana Bucharest Crime Statistics 2000–2004] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716235025/http://b.politiaromana.ro/index.php?pag=statistica_2000_2004_ro&limba=romana |date=16 July 2011 }}, Bucharest Directorate-General of Police</ref> and by 7% between 2012 and 2013.<ref name=bucurestipolitia2013>{{Cite web|url=http://b.politiaromana.ro/pdf/bilant/Bilant+DGPMB-2013.pdf|title=DGPMB – Poliția Română|website=b.politiaromana.ro|access-date=1 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002071841/https://b.politiaromana.ro/pdf/bilant/Bilant+DGPMB-2013.pdf|archive-date=2 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Bucharest, along with [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Timișoara]], [[Brașov]] and [[Iași]], was ranked among the top 100 safest cities in the world in a list compiled by Numbeo.<ref name="romania-insider.com">{{cite web | url=https://www.romania-insider.com/five-romanian-cities-top-100-safest-world-2023 | title=Five Romanian cities ranked in top 100 safest in the world | date=3 April 2023 }}</ref> The study found Bucharest to be very safe with regard to aspects such walking alone, home invasions, muggings, cars being stolen, assault, insults, assault due to skin color, ethnic origin, or gender, drug dealing, and armed robberies, with the only crimes in the high category being corruption and bribery.<ref name="romania-insider.com"/> In  2015, the [[List of countries by intentional homicide rate|homicide rate]] of Bucharest was 0,8 per 100,000 people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dataunodc.un.org/data/homicide/Homicide+in+cities|title=Homicide in cities &#124; dataUNODC|website=dataunodc.un.org}}</ref>

Crime in Bucharest is combated by national forces, such as the [[Romanian Police]] and [[Gendarmerie (Romania)|Romanian Gendarmerie]], and by local forces, such as the Local Police of Bucharest.

Although in the 2000s, a number of police crackdowns on [[organized crime|organised crime]] gangs occurred, such as the Cămătaru clan, organised crime generally has little impact on public life. Petty crime, however, is more common, particularly in the form of [[pickpocketing]], which occurs mainly on the city's public transport network. [[Confidence trick]]s were common in the 1990s, especially in regards to tourists, but the frequency of these incidents has since declined. Theft was reduced by 13.6% in 2013 compared to 2012.<ref name=bucurestipolitia2013 /> Levels of crime are higher in the southern districts of the city, particularly in [[Ferentari]], a socially disadvantaged area.

Although the presence of [[street children]] was a problem in Bucharest in the 1990s, their numbers have declined in recent years, now lying at or below the average of major European capital cities.<ref name="hf">{{Cite web |url= http://www.hiltonfoundation.org/press/16-pdf3.pdf |title= Worldwide Street Children statistics |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111208075915/http://www.hiltonfoundation.org/press/16-pdf3.pdf |archive-date= 8 December 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&nbsp;{{small|(20.5&nbsp;KB)}}, [[Conrad N.

=== Quality of life ===
As stated by the [[Mercer (consulting firm)|Mercer]] international surveys for quality of life in cities around the world, Bucharest occupied the 94th place in 2001<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.expat.or.id/info/qualityofliving.html |title=Worldwide Quality of Living Survey |publisher=Expat.or.id |date=11 March 2002 |access-date=14 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415143434/http://www.expat.or.id/info/qualityofliving.html |archive-date=15 April 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> and slipped lower, to the 108th place in 2009 and the 107th place in 2010.

Mercer Human Resource Consulting issues yearly a global ranking of the world's most livable cities based on 39 key quality-of-life issues. Among them: political stability, currency-exchange regulations, political and media censorship, school quality, housing, the environment, and public safety. Mercer collects data worldwide, in 215 cities. The difficult situation of the quality of life in Bucharest is confirmed also by a vast urbanism study, done by the [[Ion Mincu University of Architecture and Urbanism]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://csb2035.ro/pdf/rezumat/CSB_rezumat.pdf |title=Conceptul Strategic București 2035 ETAPA I – see page 44 ref. to quality of life in Bucharest |access-date=19 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125021515/http://www.csb2035.ro/pdf/rezumat/CSB_rezumat.pdf |archive-date=25 November 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2016, Bucharest's urban situation was described as 'critical' by a Romanian Order of Architects (OAR) report that criticised the city's weak, incoherent and arbitrary public management policies, its elected officials' lack of transparency and public engagement, as well as its inadequate and unsustainable use of essential urban resources.<ref>De ce e nevoie de Legea Bucureștiului.

Bucharest's historical city centre is listed as 'endangered' by the [[World Monuments Watch]] (as of 2016).<ref name="wmf.org" />

Although many neighbourhoods, particularly in the southern part of the city, lack sufficient green space, being formed of cramped, high-density blocks of flats, Bucharest also has many [[Urban park|parks]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.romania-insider.com/green-is-good-ten-large-parks-in-bucharest/|title=Green is good: Ten large parks in Bucharest – Romania Insider|first=Irina|last=Marica|date=22 June 2015|website=Romania-insider.com|access-date=1 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002070653/https://www.romania-insider.com/green-is-good-ten-large-parks-in-bucharest/|archive-date=2 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2024, Bucharest was ranked by the digital publication Freaking Nomads as the 9th best city in the world for [[digital nomad]]s, due to its elaborate and diverse architecture, an arts scene featuring some of the world’s best galleries, museums, and theatres, and its tranquil parks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.travel2latam.com/news-89760-the-best-cities-for-digital-nomads-worldwide|title=The best cities for digital nomads worldwide|website=en.travel2latam.com|date=May 10, 2024|access-date=May 10, 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.romaniajournal.ro/business/bucharest-included-again-among-the-best-cities-for-digital-nomads-worldwide/|title=Bucharest, Included Again Among The Best Cities For Digital Nomads Worldwide|publisher=Romania Journal|date=May 10, 2024|access-date=May 10, 2024}}</ref>

As per the [[2021 Romanian census|2021 census]], 1,716,961 inhabitants lived within the city limits, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2011 census.<ref name="RPL2021" /> This decrease is due to low natural increase, but also to a shift in population from the city itself to its smaller [[satellite town]]s such as [[Popești-Leordeni]], [[Voluntari]], [[Chiajna]], [[Bragadiru]], [[Pantelimon, Ilfov|Pantelimon]], [[Buftea]] and [[Otopeni]]. In a study published by the United Nations, Bucharest placed 19th among 28 cities that recorded sharp declines in population from 1990 to the mid-2010s. In particular, the population fell by 3.77%.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.incont.ro/social/orasele-care-isi-pierd-locuitorii-bucurestiul-in-top-20-localitati-ale-lumii-cu-cea-mai-mare-rata-de-scadere.html|title = Orașele care își pierd locuitorii.

Bucharest's population experienced two phases of rapid growth, the first beginning in the late 19th century when the city was consolidated as the national capital and lasting until the Second World War, and the second during the Ceaușescu years (1965–1989), when a massive urbanization campaign was launched and many people migrated from rural areas to the capital. At this time, due to Ceaușescu's decision to ban abortion and contraception, [[natural increase]] was also significant.

Bucharest is a city of high [[population density]]: 8,260/km<sup>2</sup> (21,400/sq mi),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.codatu.org/wp-content/uploads/PRESENTATION-Evaluation-of-the-performance-of-urban-public-transport-connectivity-EN.pdf |title=Evaluation of the performance of urban public transport connectivity |access-date=26 October 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220111559/http://www.codatu.org/wp-content/uploads/PRESENTATION-Evaluation-of-the-performance-of-urban-public-transport-connectivity-EN.pdf |archive-date=20 December 2016 }}</ref> as most of the population lives in high-density communist era [[Tower block#Central and Eastern Europe|apartment blocks]] (''blocuri''). However, this also depends on the part of the city: the southern boroughs have a higher density than the northern ones. Of the European Union country capital-cities, only [[Paris]] and [[Athens]] have a higher population density (see [[List of European Union cities proper by population density]]). In addition to blocks of flats built during the communist era, there are also older interwar ones, as well as newer ones built in the 1990s and in the 21st century. Although apartment buildings are strongly associated with the communist era, such housing schemes were first introduced in Bucharest in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://evz.ro/cand-a-fost-construit-primul-bloc-de-proprietari.html | title=Când a fost construit primul bloc de proprietari și unde se află.

Bucharest's public transport system is the largest in Romania and one of the largest in Europe. It is made up of the [[Bucharest Metro]], run by [[Metrorex]], as well as a surface transport system run by [[RATB|STB]] (''Societatea de Transport București'', previously known as the RATB), which consists of buses, [[Trams in Bucharest|trams]], [[trolleybus]]es, and [[Bucharest Light rail|light rail]]. In addition, a private [[Marshrutka#The South Caucasus states|minibus system]] operates there. {{As of|2007}}, a limit of 10,000 taxicab licences was imposed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfin.ro/articol_8335/atacul_clonelor_in_taximetria_bucuresteana.html |title=Săptămâna Financiară &#124; Anchete &#124; Atacul clonelor în taximetria bucureșteană |publisher=Sfin.ro |access-date=7 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216081436/http://www.sfin.ro/articol_8335/atacul_clonelor_in_taximetria_bucuresteana.html |archive-date=16 February 2009 }}</ref>

=== Railways ===
[[File:Exterior_of_the_Bucharest_North_Station_(04).jpg|thumb|right|[[Gara de Nord]] (North Railway Station)]]
It is the hub of Romania's national railway network, run by ''[[Căile Ferate Române]]''. The main railway station is [[Gara de Nord]] ('North Station'), which provides connections to all major cities in Romania, as well as international destinations: [[Belgrade]], [[Sofia]], [[Varna, Bulgaria|Varna]], [[Chișinău]], [[Kyiv]], [[Chernivtsi]], [[Lviv]], [[Thessaloniki]], [[Vienna]], [[Budapest]], [[Istanbul]], [[Moscow]], etc.

The city has five other railway stations run by CFR, of which the most important are Basarab (adjacent to North Station), Obor, Băneasa, and Progresul. These are in the process of being integrated into a commuter railway serving Bucharest and the surrounding [[Ilfov County]]. Seven main lines radiate out of Bucharest.

The oldest station in Bucharest is Filaret. It was inaugurated in 1869, and in 1960, the communist government turned it in a bus terminal.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://adevarul.ro/news/bucuresti/bucuresti-povesti-1_531a533d0d133766a8b4de51/index.html |title=Poveștile gărilor din Bucureşti.

=== Roads ===
Bucharest is a major intersection of [[Roads in Romania|Romania's national road network]]. A few of the busiest national roads and motorways link the city to all of Romania's major cities, as well as to neighbouring countries such as Hungary, Bulgaria and Ukraine. The [[A1 freeway (Romania)|A1]] to Pitești, and from Sibiu to the Hungarian border, the [[A2 motorway (Romania)|A2 Sun Motorway]] to the Dobrogea region and Constanța, and the [[A3 freeway (Romania)|A3]] to Ploiești all start from Bucharest.

A series of high-capacity boulevards, which generally radiate out from the city centre to the outskirts, provides a framework for the municipal road system. The main axes, which run north–south, east–west and northwest–southeast, as well as one internal and one external ring road, support the bulk of the traffic.

Although it is situated on the banks of a river, Bucharest has never functioned as a port city. Other Romanian cities such as [[Constanța]] and [[Galați]] serve as the country's main ports. The unfinished [[Danube-Bucharest Canal]], which is {{convert|73|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long and around 70% completed, could link Bucharest to the [[Danube River]], and via the [[Danube-Black Sea Canal]], to the [[Black Sea]]. Works on the canal were suspended in 1989, but proposals have been made to resume construction as part of the European Strategy for the Danube Region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.adevarul.ro/forbes/out_front/Forbes-Canalul-Dunare-Bucuresti-Criza-mondiala_0_389361252.html|title=Danube-Bucharest Canal vs. the Global Crisis|date=13 December 2010|access-date=5 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911141425/http://www.adevarul.ro/forbes/out_front/Forbes-Canalul-Dunare-Bucuresti-Criza-mondiala_0_389361252.html|archive-date=11 September 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Romania}}

Bucharest has a growing cultural scene, in fields including the visual arts, performing arts, and nightlife. Unlike other parts of Romania, such as the Black Sea coast or [[Transylvania]], Bucharest's cultural scene has no defined style, and instead incorporates elements of Romanian and international culture.

=== Landmarks ===

Bucharest has landmark buildings and monuments. Perhaps the most prominent of these is the [[Palace of the Parliament]], built in the 1980s during the rule of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu. The [[List of largest buildings in the world#Special categories|largest Parliament building]] in the world, the palace houses the Romanian Parliament (the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]], and the [[Senate of Romania|Senate]]), as well as the [[National Museum of Contemporary Art (Romania)|National Museum of Contemporary Art]]. The building boasts one of the largest convention centres in the world.

Another landmark in Bucharest is [[Arcul de Triumf]] ("The Triumphal Arch"), built in its current form in 1935 and modelled after the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in Paris. A newer landmark of the city is the [[Memorial of Rebirth]], a stylised marble pillar unveiled in 2005 to commemorate the victims of the [[Romanian Revolution]] of 1989, which overthrew Communism. The abstract monument sparked controversy when it was unveiled, being dubbed with names such as 'the olive on the toothpick' (''măslina-n scobitoare''), as many argued that it does not fit in its surroundings and believed that its choice was political.<ref>[http://www.sfin.ro/articol_1992/_memorialul_renasterii___ce_oribilitate_.html "Memorialul Renasterii", ce oribilitate!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217024722/http://www.sfin.ro/articol_1992/_memorialul_renasterii___ce_oribilitate_.html |date=17 February 2006 }} ("The Monument of Rebirth – how horrible!"), ''Săptămâna Financiară'', August 2005 {{in lang|ro}}</ref>

The [[Romanian Athenaeum]] building is considered a symbol of Romanian culture and since 2007 has been on the list of the Label of European Heritage sites. It was built between 1886 and 1888 by the architect Paul Louis Albert Galeron, through public funding.<ref>[http://nato.mae.ro/index.php?lang=en&id=31&s=23698&arhiva=true Romanian Athenaeum awarded Label of European Heritage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415042903/http://nato.mae.ro/index.php?lang=en&id=31&s=23698&arhiva=true |date=15 April 2008 }}, Romania's Permanent Delegation to NATO</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fge.org.ro/filarmonica/istoric-ateneu/|title=Istoric Ateneu|website=FGEB|access-date=1 April 2021|archive-date=27 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210127154413/https://www.fge.org.ro/filarmonica/istoric-ateneu/|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[InterContinental Bucharest]] is a high-rise five-star hotel near University Square and is also a landmark of the city. The building is designed so that each room has a unique panorama of the city.<ref>[http://www.hotel-bucuresti.com/hoteluri/hotel_intercontinental-39.html Hotel Intercontinental Bucharest] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312005015/http://www.hotel-bucuresti.com/hoteluri/hotel_intercontinental-39.html |date=12 March 2015 }} (" 5 star hotel "), ''Hotel-bucuresti.com'',{{in lang|ro}}</ref>

[[House of the Free Press|House of the Spark]] (''Casa Scânteii'') is a replica of the [[Lomonosov Moscow State University]]. This edifice, built in the characteristic style of the large-scale Soviet projects, was intended to be representative of the new political regime and to assert the superiority of the Communist doctrine. Construction started in 1952 and was completed in 1957, a few years after Stalin's death in 1953. Popularly known as Casa Scânteii ('House of the Spark') after the name of the official gazette of the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party, ''Scânteia'', it was made for the purpose of bringing together under one roof all of Bucharest's official press and publishing houses. It is the only building in Bucharest featuring the [[Hammer and Sickle]], the Red Star and other communist insignia carved into medallions adorning the façade.

Other cultural venues include the [[National Museum of Art of Romania]], [[Grigore Antipa National Museum of Natural History]], [[Museum of the Romanian Peasant]], [[National Museum of Romanian History|National History Museum]] and the [[National Military Museum (Romania)|Military Museum]].

In terms of [[visual arts]], the city has museums featuring both classical and contemporary Romanian art, as well as selected international works. The [[National Museum of Art of Romania]] is perhaps the best-known of Bucharest museums. It is located in the royal palace and features collections of medieval and modern Romanian art, including works by sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]], as well as an international collection assembled by the Romanian royal family.

Other, smaller, museums contain specialised collections. The [[Zambaccian Museum]], which is situated in the former home of art collector Krikor H. Zambaccian, contains works by well-known Romanian artists and international artists such as [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Camille Pissarro]], and [[Pablo Picasso]].

The [[Gheorghe Tattarescu]] Museum contains portraits of Romanian revolutionaries in exile such as [[Gheorghe Magheru]], [[ștefan Golescu]], and [[Nicolae Bălcescu]], and allegorical compositions with revolutionary (''Romania's rebirth'', 1849) and patriotic (''The [[Danubian Principalities#United Principalities|Principalities' Unification]]'', 1857) themes. Another impressive art collection gathering important Romanian painters, can be found at the Ligia and Pompiliu Macovei residence, which is open to visitors as it is now part of the Bucharest Museum patrimony.

The [[Theodor Pallady Museum]] is situated in one of the oldest surviving merchant houses in Bucharest and includes works by Romanian painter [[Theodor Pallady]], as well as European and oriental furniture pieces. The [[Museum of Art Collections]] contains the collections of Romanian art aficionados, including Krikor Zambaccian and Theodor Pallady.

Despite the classical art galleries and museums in the city, a contemporary arts scene also exists. The [[National Museum of Contemporary Art (Romania)|National Museum of Contemporary Art]] (MNAC), situated in a wing of the [[Palace of the Parliament]], was opened in 2004 and contains Romanian and international contemporary art. The MNAC also manages the Kalinderu MediaLab, which caters to multimedia and experimental art. Private art galleries are scattered throughout the city centre.

The palace of the [[National Bank of Romania]] houses the national [[numismatic]] collection. Exhibits include banknotes, coins, documents, photographs, maps, silver and gold bullion bars, bullion coins, and dies and moulds. The building was constructed between 1884 and 1890. The thesaurus room contains notable marble decorations.

=== Performing arts ===

[[File:Bucuresti, Romania. Teatrul ODEON. Zi de vara. Biciclista. (B-II-m-B-19854).jpg|thumb|right|[[Odeon Theatre (Bucharest)|Odeon Theatre]] in June 2018]]

[[Performing arts]] are some of the strongest cultural elements of Bucharest. The most famous symphony orchestra is [[National Radio Orchestra of Romania]]. One of the most prominent buildings is the neoclassical [[Romanian Athenaeum]], which was founded in 1852, and hosts classical music concerts, the [[George Enescu Festival]], and is home to the [[George Enescu Philharmonic Orchestra]].

Bucharest is home to the [[Romanian National Opera, Bucharest|Romanian National Opera]] and the [[I.L. Caragiale National Theatre]]. Another well-known theatre in Bucharest is the [[State Jewish Theater (Romania)|State Jewish Theatre]], which features plays starring world-renowned Romanian-Jewish actress [[Maia Morgenstern]]. Smaller theatres throughout the city cater to specific genres, such as the Comedy Theatre, the Nottara Theatre, the [[Bulandra Theatre]], the [[Odeon Theatre (Bucharest)|Odeon Theatre]], and the revue theatre of [[Constantin Tănase]].

=== Music and nightlife ===
[[File:Liscani Street 3.jpg|thumb|The [[Bucharest Old Town|Old Town]] is the heart of Bucharest nightlife.]]

Bucharest is home to Romania's largest recording labels, and is often the residence of Romanian musicians. Romanian rock bands of the 1970s and 1980s, such as [[IRIS (Romanian band)|Iris]] and Holograf, continue to be popular, particularly with the middle-aged, while since the beginning of the 1990s, the [[hip hop music|hip hop]]/[[rapping|rap]] scene has developed. Hip-hop bands and artists from Bucharest such as [[B.U.G. Mafia]], [[Paraziții]], and [[La Familia (rap group)|La Familia]] enjoy national and international recognition.

The pop-rock band [[Taxi (Romanian band)|Taxi]] have been gaining international respect, as has [[Spitalul de Urgență]]'s raucous updating of traditional [[Music of Romania|Romanian music]]. While many neighbourhood [[discothèque|discos]] play ''[[manele]]'', an Oriental- and Roma-influenced genre of music that is particularly popular in Bucharest's working-class districts, the city has a rich [[jazz]] and [[blues]] scene, and to an even larger extent, [[house music]]/[[trance music|trance]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]/[[punk music|punk]] scenes. Bucharest's jazz profile has especially risen since 2002, with the presence of two venues, Green Hours and Art Jazz, as well as an American presence alongside established Romanians.

With no central nightlife strip, entertainment venues are dispersed throughout the city, with clusters in [[Lipscani]] and [[Regie, Bucharest|Regie]].

=== Cultural events and festivals ===

A number of cultural festivals are held in Bucharest throughout the year, but most festivals take place in June, July, and August. The National Opera organises the International Opera Festival every year in May and June, which includes ensembles and orchestras from all over the world.

The Romanian Athaeneum Society hosts the [[George Enescu Festival]] at locations throughout the city in September every two years (odd years). The Museum of the Romanian Peasant and the Village Museum organise events throughout the year, showcasing Romanian folk arts and crafts.

In the 2000s, due to the growing prominence of the Chinese community in Bucharest, Chinese cultural events took place. The first officially organised Chinese festival was the [[Chinese New Year]]'s Eve Festival of February 2005, which took place in Nichita Stănescu Park and was organised by the Bucharest City Hall.<ref>[http://www.daily-news.ro/article_detail.php?idarticle=5737 Chinese New Year's Eve celebrated in Bucharest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219163629/http://www.daily-news.ro/article_detail.php?idarticle=5737 |date=19 February 2006 }}, ''[[Bucharest Daily News]]'', 7 February 2005</ref>

In 2005, Bucharest was the first city in Southeastern Europe to host the international [[CowParade]], which resulted in dozens of decorated cow sculptures being placed across the city.

In 2004, Bucharest imposed in the circle of important festivals in Eastern Europe with the Bucharest International Film Festival, an event widely acknowledged in Europe, having as guests of honour famous names from the world cinema: [[Andrei Konchalovsky]], [[Danis Tanović]], [[Nikita Mikhalkov]], [[Rutger Hauer]], [[Jerzy Skolimowski]], [[Jan Harlan]], [[Radu Mihăileanu]], and many others.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://b-iff.ro/poveste/ |title=Poveste |work=BIFF |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520215804/http://b-iff.ro/poveste/ |archive-date=20 May 2014 }}</ref>

Since 2005, Bucharest has its own contemporary [[art exhibition|art biennale]], the [[Bucharest Biennale]].

=== Traditional culture ===

[[File:Bucarest Musee national du village56.JPG|thumb|right|Traditional wooden church at the [[Dimitrie Gusti National Village Museum|Village Museum]]]]
Traditional Romanian culture continues to have a major influence in arts such as theatre, film, and music. Bucharest has two internationally renowned [[ethnography|ethnographic]] museums, the [[Museum of the Romanian Peasant]] and the open-air [[Dimitrie Gusti National Village Museum in Bucharest|Dimitrie Gusti National Village Museum]], in [[King Michael I Park]]. It contains 272 authentic buildings and peasant farms from all over Romania.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.muzeul-satului.ro/viziteaza-muzeul |title=Vizitează muzeul |work=Muzeul Național al Satului "Dimitrie Gusti" |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521031403/http://www.muzeul-satului.ro/viziteaza-muzeul |archive-date=21 May 2014 }}</ref>

The Museum of the Romanian Peasant was declared the European Museum of the Year in 1996. Patronised by the Ministry of Culture, the museum preserves and exhibits numerous collections of objects and monuments of material and spiritual culture. The Museum of the Romanian Peasant holds one of the richest collections of peasant objects in Romania, its heritage being nearly 90,000 pieces, those being divided into several collections: ceramics, costumes, textiles, wooden objects, religious objects, customs, etc.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.muzeultaranuluiroman.ro/index.php?page=muzeu |title=Prezentare muzeu |work=Muzeul Național al Țăranului Român |access-date=20 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520220631/http://www.muzeultaranuluiroman.ro/index.php?page=muzeu |archive-date=20 May 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Museum of Romanian History]] is another important museum in Bucharest, containing a collection of artefacts detailing Romanian history and culture from the prehistoric times, [[Dacia]]n era, medieval times, and the modern era.

=== Religion ===

Bucharest is the seat of the Patriarch of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], one of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches in communion with the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], and also of its subdivisions, the Metropolis of Muntenia and Dobrudja and the Archbishopric of Bucharest. Orthodox believers consider Demetrius of Basarabov to be the patron saint of the city.

The city is a centre for other Christian organizations in Romania, including the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bucharest]], established in 1883, and the [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Romanian Greek-Catholic]] [[Romanian Catholic Eparchy of Bucharest|Eparchy of Saint Basil the Great]], founded in 2014.

Bucharest also hosts six synagogues, including the [[Templul Coral|Choral Temple of Bucharest]], the [[Great Synagogue (Bucharest)|Great Synagogue of Bucharest]] and the [[Jewish Museum (Bucharest)|Holy Union Temple]]. The latter was converted into the Museum of the History of the Romanian Jewish Community, while the Great Synagogue and the Choral Temple are both active and hold regular services.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stanciulescu|first=Anda|date=1–31 March 2014|title=La Pas Prin Sinagogile Bucureștene|url=http://www.jewishfed.ro/downloads/realitatea/RE424-425.pdf|journal=Realitatea Evreiască|access-date=27 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816075112/http://www.jewishfed.ro/downloads/realitatea/RE424-425.pdf|archive-date=16 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Architecture ==
The city centre is a mixture of [[Medieval architecture|medieval]], [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]], [[Art Deco]], and [[Art Nouveau]] buildings, as well as 'neo-Romanian' buildings dating from the beginning of the 20th century and a collection of modern buildings from the 1920s and 1930s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} The mostly utilitarian Communist-era architecture dominates most southern boroughs. Recently built contemporary structures such as skyscrapers and office buildings complete the landscape.

=== Historical architecture ===

[[File:33, Strada Franceză, Bucharest (Romania).jpg|thumb|[[Curtea Veche Church]]]]

Of the city's [[Middle Ages|medieval]] architecture, most of what survived into modern times was destroyed by communist [[Systematization (Romania)|systematization]], fire, and military incursions. Some medieval and renaissance edifices remain, the most notable are in the Lipscani area. This precinct contains notable buildings such as [[Manuc's Inn]] (''Hanul lui Manuc'') and the ruins of the [[Curtea Veche|Old Court]] (''Curtea Veche''); during the late Middle Ages, this area was the heart of commerce in Bucharest. From the 1970s onwards, the area went through urban decline, and many historical buildings fell into disrepair. In 2005, the Lipscani area was restored.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://urbanism.pmb.ro/Informa%C5%A3ii%20publice/Zone%20protejate%20construite/Zone%20protejate%20construite%20aprobate%20prin%20HCGMB%20nr.%202792000/lipscani.pdf|title=Lipscani, zonă protejată|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831003602/http://urbanism.pmb.ro/Informa%C5%A3ii%20publice/Zone%20protejate%20construite/Zone%20protejate%20construite%20aprobate%20prin%20HCGMB%20nr.%202792000/lipscani.pdf|archive-date=31 August 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

To execute a massive redevelopment project during the rule of Nicolae Ceaușescu, the government conducted extensive demolition of churches and many other historic structures in Romania. According to Alexandru Budișteanu, former chief architect of Bucharest, "The sight of a church bothered Ceaușescu. It didn't matter if they demolished or moved it, as long as it was no longer in sight". Nevertheless, a project organised by Romanian engineer Eugeniu Iordăchescu was able to move many historic structures to less-prominent sites and save them.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Smith |first=Harrison |date=2019-01-08 |title=Eugeniu Iordachescu, Romanian engineer who saved condemned churches under communist rule, dies at 89 |language=en-US |newspaper=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/eugeniu-iordachescu-romanian-engineer-who-saved-condemned-churches-under-communist-rule-dies-at-89/2019/01/07/99c45f0c-128e-11e9-803c-4ef28312c8b9_story.html |access-date=2024-01-01 |issn=0190-8286 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110030453/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/eugeniu-iordachescu-romanian-engineer-who-saved-condemned-churches-under-communist-rule-dies-at-89/2019/01/07/99c45f0c-128e-11e9-803c-4ef28312c8b9_story.html |archive-date=10 January 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The city centre has retained architecture from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly the [[interwar period]], which is often seen as the 'golden age' of Bucharest architecture. During this time, the city grew in size and wealth, therefore seeking to emulate other large European capitals such as Paris. Much of the architecture of the time belongs to a Modern (rationalist) Architecture current, led by Horia Creangă and [[Marcel Iancu]].

In Romania, the tendencies of innovation in the architectural language met the need of valorisation and affirmation of the national cultural identity. The [[Art Nouveau]] movement found expression through new architectural style initiated by [[Ion Mincu]] and taken over by other prestigious architects who capitalised important references of Romanian laic and medieval ecclesiastical architecture (for example the [[Mogoșoaia Palace]], the [[Stavropoleos Monastery|Stavropoleos Church]] or the disappeared church of Văcărești Monastery) and Romanian folk motifs.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bucharestunknown.blogspot.ro/2010/06/art-nouveau-in-bucuresti.html |title=Stilul arhitectural național romantic și Art Nouveau în București |work=Unknown Bucharest |date=20 June 2010 |access-date=20 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904033728/http://bucharestunknown.blogspot.ro/2010/06/art-nouveau-in-bucuresti.html |archive-date=4 September 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Romanian Revival architecture]], which was born as the result of the attempts of finding a specific Romanian architectural style, is exemplified though buildings such as [[Nicolae Minovici Folk Art Museum]] and the [[Romanian Peasant Museum]].

Another style of the 1930s is the Moorish-Florentine or Mediterranean Picturesque, which [[Eclecticism in architecture|eclectically]] uses [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] elements in civic architecture, with a Mediterranean vibe, giving rise to [[Mediterranean Revival architecture]].

Some buildings from the interwar era have a modernist brutalist look, such as the Tehnoimport Building, which was built in 1935,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://bucurestiivechisinoi.ro/2012/04/blocul-tehnoimport/ | title=Blocul Tehnoimport | date=12 April 2012 }}</ref> and may be mistaken as communist architecture. Modernist styles during the interwar period include [[Art Deco]], [[Stripped Classicism]], [[Bauhaus]] and [[Rationalism]].

Two buildings from this time are the [[Crețulescu Palace]], housing cultural institutions including [[UNESCO]]'s European Centre for Higher Education, and the [[Cotroceni Palace]], the residence of the [[President of Romania|Romanian President]]. Many large-scale constructions such as the Gara de Nord, the busiest railway station in the city, National Bank of Romania's headquarters, and the [[Telephones Company Building]] date from these times. In the 2000s, some historic buildings in the city centre underwent restoration. In some residential areas of the city, particularly in high-income central and northern districts, [[fin-de-siecle|turn-of-the-20th-century]] villas were mostly restored beginning in the late 1990s.

=== Communist era architecture ===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2024}}
A major part of Bucharest's architecture is made up of buildings constructed during the [[Communist Romania|Communist era]] replacing the historical architecture with high-density apartment blocks – significant portions of the [[Ceaușima|historic centre of Bucharest]] were demolished to construct one of the largest buildings in the world, the [[Palace of the Parliament]] (then officially called the House of the Republic). In Nicolae Ceaușescu's project of systematization, new buildings were built in previously historical areas, which were razed and then built upon.

Communist architecture broadly includes three stages: architecture that was built in the early years of communism, in the late 1940s and 1950s, which followed the Soviet Stalinist trend of [[Socialist Realism]], an example being the [[House of the Free Press]] (which was named ''Casa Scînteii'' during communism); postwar Modernism in the 1960s and the 1970s; and the [[Systematization (Romania)|systematization]]  program of the late 1970s and 1980s, which included mass demolitions of historical buildings and their replacement with [[North Korea]]n influenced buildings after Nicolae Ceaușescu visited  [[East Asia]] in 1971, and was impressed by its [[Juche]] [[ideology]].

The Communist regime installed after World War II took control over all aspects of life, including architecture, dictating a uniform bureaucratic vision of urbanism and architectural design. [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]], who was premier of the Socialist Republic of Romania from 1947 until 1965, began the country's policies of industrialization, with infrastructure development for heavy industry, and construction for mass resettlement to new industrial and agricultural centers away from Bucharest and other principal cities. The architecture from this period is more or less easy to spot, by its use of Neoclassical elements and proportions, but in a simplified way. There are also some small 3-4 floors "Russian blocks" from this era, some of them built of red bricks.

Communist-era architecture from the 1960s and 1970s can be found especially in Bucharest's residential districts, mainly in ''blocuri'', which are high-density apartment blocks that house the majority of the city's population. Initially, these apartment blocks started to be constructed in the 1960s, on relatively empty areas and fields (good examples include Pajura, Drumul Taberei, Berceni and Titan), however with the 1970s, they mostly targeted peripheral neighbourhoods such as Colentina, Pantelimon, Militari and Rahova. Construction of these apartment blocks were also often randomised, for instance some small streets were demolished and later widened with the blocks being built next to them, but other neighbouring streets were left intact (like in the example of Calea Moșilor from 1978 to 1982), or built in various patterns such as the Piața Iancului-Lizeanu apartment buildings from 1962 to 1963.

The last years of communism were marked by major urban redevelopment schemes which changed dramatically the face of many cities, including Bucharest. One of the most singular examples of late stage communist architecture of the 1980s is [[Centrul Civic]], a development that replaced a major part of Bucharest's historic city centre with giant utilitarian buildings, mainly with [[marble]] or [[travertine]] façades, inspired by North Korean architecture. The mass demolitions that occurred in the 1980s, under which an overall area of eight square kilometres of the historic centre of Bucharest were levelled, including monasteries, churches, synagogues, a hospital, and a noted [[Art Deco]] sports stadium, changed drastically the appearance of the city.

=== Contemporary architecture ===

Since [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|the fall of communism in 1989]], several communist-era buildings have been refurbished, modernised, and used for other purposes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://greateconomy.ro/povestea-fabricilor-bucurestene-transformate-in-mall-uri-sau-apartamente/|title=Fabrici comuniste, transformate in mall-uri sau apartamente|first=Redactia Great|last=Economy|date=14 September 2015|website=Greateconomy.ro|access-date=1 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027123813/http://greateconomy.ro/povestea-fabricilor-bucurestene-transformate-in-mall-uri-sau-apartamente/|archive-date=27 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Perhaps the best example of this is the conversion of obsolete retail complexes into shopping malls and commercial centres. These giant, circular halls, which were unofficially called [[hunger circus]]es due to the food shortages experienced in the 1980s, were constructed during the Ceaușescu era to act as produce markets and [[refectory|refectories]], although most were left unfinished at the time of the revolution.

Modern shopping malls such as the [[Unirea Shopping Center|Unirea Shopping Centre]], [[Bucharest Mall]], [[Plaza Romania]], and [[City Mall, Romania|City Mall]] emerged on pre-existent structures of former hunger circuses. Another example is the conversion of a large utilitarian construction in Centrul Civic into a [[Marriott International|Marriott Hotel]]. This process was accelerated after 2000, when the city underwent a property boom, and many communist-era buildings in the city centre became prime real estate due to their location. Many communist-era apartment blocks have also been refurbished to improve urban appearance.

The newest contribution to Bucharest's architecture took place after the fall of communism, particularly after 2000, when the city went through a period of urban renewal{{spaced ndash}}and architectural revitalization{{spaced ndash}}on the back of Romania's economic growth. Buildings from this time are mostly made of glass and steel, and often have more than 10 stories. Examples include shopping malls (particularly the Bucharest Mall, a conversion and extension of an abandoned building), office buildings, bank headquarters, etc.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

During the 21st century, several high rise office buildings were built, particularly in the northern and eastern parts of the city. Additionally, a trend to add modern wings and façades to historic buildings has occurred, the most prominent example of which is the Bucharest Architects' Association Building, which is a modern glass-and-steel construction built inside a historic stone façade. In 2013, the Bucharest skyline enriched with a 137-m-high office building (SkyTower of [[Floreasca City Center|Floreasca City Centre]]), the tallest building in Romania. Examples of modern skyscrapers built in the 21st century include [[Bucharest Tower Center|Bucharest Tower Centre]], [[Euro Tower (Bucharest)|Euro Tower]], [[Nusco Tower]], [[Cathedral Plaza]], [[City Gate Towers]], [[Rin Grand Hotel]], [[Premium Plaza]], [[Bucharest Corporate Center|Bucharest Corporate Centre]], [[Millennium Business Center|Millennium Business Centre]], [[Phoenix Tower, Bucharest|PGV Tower]], [[Charles de Gaulle Plaza]], Business Development Centre Bucharest, [[BRD Tower Bucharest|BRD Tower]], and [[Bucharest Financial Plaza]]. Despite this vertical development, Romanian architects avoid designing very tall buildings due to vulnerability to earthquakes.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://stiri.tvr.ro/bucurestiul-nu-este-un-oras-pentru-zgarie-nori--e-mai-degraba-un-oras-pe-orizontala_44232.html |title=Bucureștiul nu este un oraș pentru zgârie-nori, e mai degrabă un oraș pe orizontală |newspaper=Știrile TVR |date=7 May 2014 |access-date=20 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520220710/http://stiri.tvr.ro/bucurestiul-nu-este-un-oras-pentru-zgarie-nori--e-mai-degraba-un-oras-pe-orizontala_44232.html |archive-date=20 May 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Aside from buildings used for business and institutions, residential developments have also been built, many of which consist of high-rise office buildings and suburban residential communities. An example of a new high rise residential complex is [[Asmita Gardens]]. These developments are increasingly prominent in northern Bucharest, which is less densely populated and is home to middle- and upper-class Bucharesters due to the process of [[gentrification]].

== Media ==

The city is well-served by a modern landline and mobile network. Offices of [[Poșta Română]], the national postal operator, are spread throughout the city, with the central post office ({{langx|ro|Oficiul Poștal București 1}}) located at 12 Matei Millo Street. [[Payphone|Public telephones]] are located in many places and are operated by [[Telekom Romania]], a subsidiary of [[Deutsche Telekom]] and successor of the former monopoly [[Romtelecom]].

Bucharest is the headquarters of most national television networks and national newspapers, radio stations and online news websites. The largest daily newspapers in Bucharest include ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', ''[[Cotidianul]]'', ''[[România Liberă]]'', and {{Lang|ro|[[Adevărul]]}}, while the biggest news websites are [[HotNews]] (with English and Spanish versions), [[:ro:Ziare.com|Ziare.com]], and ''[[Gândul]]''. During the rush hours, [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspapers ''[[Click!]]'', ''[[Libertatea]]'', and ''Cancan'' are popular for commuters.

Several newspapers and media publications are based in [[House of the Free Press]] ({{lang|ro|Casa Presei Libere}}), a landmark of northern Bucharest, originally named Casa Scânteii after the [[Communist Romania]]-era official newspaper ''[[Scînteia]]''. The House of the Free Press is not the only Bucharest landmark that grew out of the media and communications industry. [[Palatul Telefoanelor]] ("The Telephone Palace") was the first major modernist building on Calea Victoriei in the city's centre, and the massive, unfinished communist-era [[Casa Radio]] looms over a park a block away from the Opera.

English-language newspapers became available in the early 1930s and reappeared in the 1990s. The two daily English-language newspapers are the ''[[Bucharest Daily News]]'' and ''[[Nine O' Clock]]''; several magazines and publications in other languages are available, such as the Hungarian-language daily ''[[Új Magyar Szó]]''.

''[[Observator Cultural]]'' covers the city's arts, and the free weekly magazines ''[[Șapte Seri]]'' ("Seven Evenings") and ''B24FUN'', list entertainment events. The city is home to the intellectual journal ''[[Dilema veche]]'' and the satire magazine ''[[Academia Cațavencu]]''.

One of the most modern hospitals in the capital is Colțea that has been re-equipped after a 90-million-euro investment in 2011. It specialises in oncological and cardiac disorders. It was built by Mihai Cantacuzino between 1701 and 1703, composed of many buildings, each with 12 to 30 beds, a church, three chapels, a school, and doctors' and teachers' houses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.romanialibera.ro/exclusiv-rl/reportaj/galerie-foto-cum-arata-noul-spital-coltea-dupa-o-investitie-de-90-de-milioane-de-dolari-214509.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120181725/http://www.romanialibera.ro/exclusiv-rl/reportaj/galerie-foto-cum-arata-noul-spital-coltea-dupa-o-investitie-de-90-de-milioane-de-dolari-214509.html|url-status=dead|title=Coltea H.|archive-date=20 January 2012}}</ref>

Another conventional hospital is Pantelimon, which was established in 1733 by [[Grigore II Ghica]]. The surface area of the hospital land property was {{convert|400000|m²|0|abbr=on}}. The hospital had in its inventory a house for infectious diseases and a house for persons with disabilities.

Other hospitals or clinics are [[Bucharest Emergency Hospital]], [[Floreasca Hospital|Floreasca Emergency Clinic Hospital]], Bucharest University Emergency Hospital, and Fundeni Clinical Institute or Biomedica International and Euroclinic, which are private.
