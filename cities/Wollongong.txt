'''Wollongong''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ʊ|l|ə|n|ɡ|ɒ|ŋ}} {{respell|WUUL|ən|gong}}; [[Dharawal]]: ''Woolyungah'') is a city located in the [[Illawarra]] region of [[New South Wales]], Australia.

The Wollongong area extends from [[Helensburgh, New South Wales|Helensburgh]] in the north to Windang and Yallah in the south. Geologically, the city is located in the south-eastern part of the [[Sydney basin]], which extends from [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] to [[Nowra]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/image/0007/96847/20758.gif |website=Dept of Primary Industries |title=Basin gif |access-date=12 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917080323/http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/image/0007/96847/20758.gif |archive-date=17 September 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Wollongong is noted for its [[heavy industry]], its port activity and the quality of its physical setting, occupying a narrow coastal plain between an almost continuous chain of surf beaches and the cliffline of the rainforest-covered Illawarra escarpment. It has two cathedrals, churches of many denominations and the [[Nan Tien Temple]]. Wollongong has a long history of coal mining and industry. The city attracts many tourists each year<ref name="TourismNSW_Illawarra_stats">{{Cite web | publisher=Tourism NSW | title=Illawarra Facts & Figures | url=http://corporate.tourism.nsw.gov.au/Illawarra_p914.aspx | access-date=2 January 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525040600/http://corporate.tourism.nsw.gov.au/Illawarra_p914.aspx | archive-date=25 May 2009 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref> and is a regional centre for the South Coast fishing industry.

==History==
[[File:Woollongong Prout SLNSW FL20195506.jpg|thumb|left|View of Wollongong, New South Wales, {{circa|1843}}]][[File:View_of_the_town_of_Wollongong,_Illawarra_1857.png|left|thumb|View of the town of Wollongong, Illawarra in 1857]]

The area was originally inhabited by the [[Dharawal]] [[Indigenous Australians]]. The first Europeans to visit the area were the navigators [[George Bass]] and [[Matthew Flinders]], who landed at Lake Illawarra in 1796. The first settlers in the region were cedar cutters in the early nineteenth century, followed by graziers in 1812. [[Charles Throsby]] established a stockman's hut in the area in 1815. The first land grants were made in 1816. In 1830, a military barracks was constructed near the harbour. Further settlers arrived and in 1834 a town was planned. On 26 November 1834, the town was first gazetted and George Brown erected the first court house. The main road down the Escarpment through [[Bulli Pass]] was built by convict labour in 1835–6, although other passes were built during the 19th century as well, such as O'Briens Road and Rixons Pass. By 1856 Wollongong had a population of 864. 
In 1858, a court house was built. In 1861, a horse-drawn tramway from [[Mount Keira]] to the harbour was completed. In 1862 a telegraph line was opened between Wollongong and [[Bellambi, New South Wales|Bellambi]]. In 1865 the first gas supply in Wollongong was provided from a gas plant in Corrimal Street. In 1868 the extensions to the harbour were opened by Lady Belmore and named Belmore Basin. Patrick Lahiff established a coke works at Wollongong Harbour in the 1870s. He erected two beehive coke ovens between the north eastern end of the basin and Pulpit Rock. The ovens were demolished in 1892. The remains of the coke ovens were uncovered and recovered and are now preserved beneath the hill, with a plaque explaining their history.[[File:Wollongong Breakwater Lighthouse (21351551761).jpg|thumb|[[Wollongong Breakwater Lighthouse]]|left]]
In 1871 the old lighthouse was completed.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}} Nevertheless, in 1881 a British [[clipper]], {{ship||Queen of Nations|clipper ship|2}}, ran ashore off the mouth of Towradgi Creek. Her cargo included 24,000 bottles of [[Hennessy]] [[Cognac]]. Local police and NSW [[Customs]] recovered at least 5,000 bottles, but others were looted by members of the public.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/238309697 |title=The Queen of Nations. |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |page=3 |date=5 July 1881 |via=Trove |access-date=30 May 2022}}</ref>[[File:Clipper Queen of Nations.jpg|thumb|A painting of {{ship||Queen of Nations|clipper ship|2}} by [[Richard Ball Spencer]]|left]]

The surviving part of the ''Queen of Nations'' wreck is only about {{convert|70|m}} from the shore, in water only {{convert|3|to|5|m|0}} deep. From time to time, a violent storm uncovers part of the wreck. After one such storm in 1991, looting resumed, including of the Cognac. The Commonwealth Government quickly issued an order protecting the wreck under the then ''[[Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Queen of Nations: A Shipwreck with Influence |url= http://www.international.icomos.org/risk/2006/04nutley2006an.pdf |first=David |last=Nutley |work=Underwater Cultural Heritage at Risk: Managing Natural and Human Impacts / Heritage at Risk – Special Edition |publisher=International Council on Monuments and Sites |date=April 2006 |access-date=30 May 2022}}</ref> Since 2018 the ''[[Underwater Cultural Heritage Act 2018]]'' has automatically protected the wreck and its contents, as they are more than 75 years old.

In 1880 steam locomotives were introduced to haul coal from Mount Keira mine to the harbour. Gas street lighting was introduced in 1883. In 1885 a new court house was erected in Market Street. Like many Australian court houses, it was designed in a Classical Revival style considered appropriate for public buildings. It is now listed on the [[Register of the National Estate]].<ref>Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Publishers, 1981, p.2/173</ref> In 1886 the first town hall was erected. The Illawarra Railway to Wollongong was completed in 1887, and now continues as far south as the town of [[Bomaderry, New South Wales|Bomaderry]] on the [[Shoalhaven River]]. The navigator George Bass first documented the Illawarra coal deposits in 1797. There have been many coalmines in the district. Australia's worst coal mining disaster occurred in 1902, at the [[Mount Kembla]] mine when an explosion killed 94 men and boys, the youngest aged 14, the oldest 69. Two other men died attempting to rescue survivors. Survivors were treated at the "A. M. (Albert Memorial) Hospital",<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article143024362 |title=Kembla Disaster Notes |newspaper=[[South Coast Times and Wollongong Argus]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=16 August 1902 |accessdate=3 January 2022 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> which opened in 1864 and closed when the Wollongong Hospital opened in 1907<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article163659124 |title=Opening of the Wollongong Hospital. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Mail and New South Wales Advertiser]] |volume=LXXXIV |issue=2386 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=31 July 1907 |accessdate=3 January 2022 |page=291 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> on Garden Hill. In 1916 the Wollongong High School was opened.

Heavy industry was attracted to the region by the ready availability of coal. In 1928, Hoskins, later Australian Iron & Steel, started a steelworks at Port Kembla, a few kilometres south of Wollongong. The former Broken Hill Proprietary Company (now [[BHP]] after merging with Billiton plc) acquired AI&S in 1935, but has since spun-out their steel division as a separate company, now known as [[BlueScope]]. The steelworks has grown to become a world-class flat rolled steel producer, operating as a fully integrated steel plant with a production of around 5 million tonnes per year. Other industries to have set up in the massive Port Kembla industrial complex—the largest single concentration of heavy industry in Australia—include a fertiliser plant, an electrolytic copper smelter, a locomotive workshop, a coal export shipping terminal, a grain export shipping terminal and an industrial gases manufacturing plant.

[[File:Crown Street, Wollongong, N.S.W. - 1940s.jpg|thumb|[[Crown Street, Wollongong|Crown Street]] in the 1940s]]

In 1936, the new Wollongong Lighthouse was finished on Flagstaff Point.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.lighthouses.org.au/lights/NSW/Wollongong/Wollongong%20Head.htm |title=The Wollongong Head Lighthouse |access-date=15 March 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304134152/http://www.lighthouses.org.au/lights/NSW/Wollongong/Wollongong%20Head.htm |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> In 1942 Wollongong was proclaimed a City. In 1947 City of Greater Wollongong was formed. In 1954 the population of Wollongong was 90,852. In 1956 new Wollongong City Council Chambers were opened. In 1961 the Wollongong University College was established. In 1963, the Wollongong Teachers College was established. In 1965 the [[Westfield Group|Westfield]] shopping centre at [[Figtree, New South Wales|Figtree]] opened.

In 1985, the railway line was electrified to Wollongong, and in 1993 to Dapto. In 1986 the Wollongong Mall was completed. For a short while, trams (trackless trains) were used in the mall, though this ceased due to dangers involved. The mall was re-opened to traffic after the initial test but re-zoned a pedestrian area after and has remained one since.

In 1987 the council chambers and library building were completed, replacing the old council building at the present art gallery site. The Crown Gateway Shopping Centre was completed. Wollongong Mall was opened. In 1988, the current council administration building was completed, as well as the Illawarra Performing Arts Centre ([[IPAC wollongong|IPAC]]), across the road on Burelli Street. IPAC was officially opened by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] in 1988. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} A sculpture recognizing [[Lawrence Hargrave]] was placed via helicopter on the eastern foothills of [[Mount Keira]]. In 1998 the 6000 seat [[WIN Entertainment Centre|Wollongong Entertainment Centre]] was opened.

In 1999, the Gateway and Crown Central mall buildings were unified as [[Wollongong Central]] and a pedestrian walkway/café was built connecting the buildings in an above ground bridge. In 2000, as part of the Sydney Olympics, the Olympic torch was carried through Wollongong as part of its journey. In 2001, the population of Wollongong reached 181,612 people. In 2004 the Wollongong City Gallery celebrated its 25th anniversary. In 2005 [[Qantas]] established a daily air service from Wollongong to Melbourne that lasted till 2008.

In 2006/2007, the library was renovated, including new facilities, as part of the tenth anniversary of the library's current site. Also at this time the beachfront was renovated with a new lookout and walkway upgrade. In June 2007, erosion was caused via storms to the beaches, the worst in 30 years.

Despite the decline of traditional manufacturing and blue-collar industries due to the abandonment of [[protectionism|protectionist]] economic policies in the 1980s, many of these industrial installations still exist. The city's economy is, however, on the rebound, thanks to diversification of economic activity including higher education, the [[fine arts]], tourism, residential construction and eco-friendly [[electricity generation]]; however, the city's economy still relies primarily on heavy industry, and will continue to in the near future. 

Various meanings are given for the Aboriginal word ' Wollongong' including 'seas of the South', ' great feast of fish' , 'hard ground near water', 'song of the sea' ' sound of the waves' 'many snakes' and ' five islands'.

In 2024, the wreck of a coal ship was discovered by accident, off the coast of Wollongong. The ship the SS Nemesis was sailing from Wollongong to Melbourne and it sank nearly 120 years ago.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/feb/25/accidental-ocean-floor-discovery-solves-120-year-old-mystery-of-coal-ship-disappearance | title=Accidental ocean floor discovery solves 120-year-old mystery of coal ship disappearance | newspaper=The Guardian | date=25 February 2024 | last1=Visontay | first1=Elias }}</ref>

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Wollongong}}
[[File:Mt Keira views 2017 - Wollongong Central.jpg|thumb|Central Wollongong and its surrounds as viewed from [[Mount Keira]]]]

The city of Wollongong has a distinct geography. It lies on a narrow coastal plain flanked by the [[Tasman Sea]] to the east and a steep sandstone precipice known as the [[Illawarra Escarpment]] to the west. The coastal plain is widest in the south and narrowest in the north, with the city [[Central business district|centre]] located about midway. South of the city centre but within the urban area is Lake Illawarra, a large lagoon. Although Wollongong sits on the immediate coast, it lies on the same [[longitude]] as [[Greater Western Sydney]]. The escarpment ranges between {{Convert|150 and 750|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, with locally famous mountains such as [[Mount Keira]] ({{Convert|464|m|ft|abbr=on}}), [[Mount Kembla]] ({{Convert|534|m|ft|abbr=on}}), [[Broker's Nose]] ({{Convert|440|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and [[Mount Murray (New South Wales)|Mount Murray]] ({{Convert|768|m|ft|abbr=on}}) to the south. It contains strata of coal measures, and the [[adit]] entrances to many coal mines have been established along the slopes of the escarpment throughout Wollongong. Suburbia encroaches on the escarpment's lower slopes in some areas, but the majority remains in a relatively natural state forested with dry [[sclerophyll]] and pockets of [[temperate rainforest]]. The escarpment is largely protected by a [[Protected areas of New South Wales#State Conservation Areas|State Conservation Area]] and local scenic protection zoning, and provides the visual backdrop to the city.

[[File:Bald Hill, overlooking Stanwell Park.jpg|thumb|Scenic view of Wollongong's northern coastline from [[Bald Hill (Australia)|Bald Hill]], overlooking [[Stanwell Park, New South Wales|Stanwell Park]]|left]]

In the north the escarpment meets the coastline, and north of this the coastal road [[Lawrence Hargrave Drive]] hugs the cliff line. The unstable geology of the escarpment resulted in rockfalls, forcing the closure of the road. Subsequently, part of Lawrence Hargrave Drive was replaced in 2005 by the [[Sea Cliff Bridge]] just off the coast, crossing the submerged rock shelf. The bridge carries both vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The [[Illawarra railway line]] must go through several tunnels to reach the Sydney metropolitan area. The [[Southern Freeway]] and [[Princes Highway]] provide alternative inland routes, descending the escarpment further south at [[Bulli Pass]] or at [[Mount Ousley, New South Wales|Mount Ousley]], entering just north of Wollongong's city centre.

To the south the plain reaches its maximum extent around [[Albion Park, New South Wales|Albion Park]] where it incorporates a large coastal saltwater lagoon called [[Lake Illawarra]], separated from the Pacific Ocean by a long sandy spit.

[[File:Walking near Wollongong.jpg|thumb|Wollongong's coastline on the outskirts of the city]]

The coastal strip consists of highly fertile [[alluvium]], which made Wollongong so attractive to agriculturists in the nineteenth century. It contains many hills including the foothills of the escarpment's lower slopes, and while these generally do not exceed one hundred metres in height they give much of the city an undulating character. The coastal strip is traversed by several short but flood-prone and fast-flowing streams and creeks such as Fairy Creek (Para Creek), Cabbage Tree Creek, Allans Creek, Nostaw Ravine, Jimbob Creek, Mullet Creek and [[Macquarie Rivulet]].

The coastline consists of many beaches characterised by fine pale gold-coloured sands; however, these beaches are sometimes interrupted by prominent and rocky headlands, such as Tego Rock, jutting into the sea. In places these headlands have been excavated or extended to create artificial harbours at Wollongong, [[Port Kembla, New South Wales|Port Kembla]], [[Shellharbour, New South Wales|Shellharbour]] and [[Kiama, New South Wales|Kiama]]. Just off the coast south of Wollongong centre, near Port Kembla, lies a group of five islands known collectively as [[Five Islands Nature Reserve|The Five Islands]]. The islands are a wildlife refuge.

===Climate===
Wollongong has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''), bordering on [[humid subtropical]] (''Cfa'')<ref>{{Cite web |title=Wollongong, New South Wales Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase) |url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=960860&cityname=Wollongong,+New+South+Wales,+Australia&units= |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906140556/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=960860&cityname=Wollongong%2C+New+South+Wales%2C+Australia&units= |archive-date=6 September 2015 |access-date=15 February 2019 |website=Weatherbase}}</ref> as its warmest month mean of {{convert|21.9|C|F}}

Rainfall is spread through the months but has a bias to the first half of the year. It is often associated with [[orographic lift]] caused by the escarpment and its exposed location on the Tasman Sea, which makes it more prone to moist easterlies. A significant flood event occurred on 18 August 1998 when Wollongong recorded 316&nbsp;mm of rainfall (the nearby suburb of Mt Ousley recorded in excess of 445&nbsp;mm), mostly falling in a 3-hour period.<ref name="BOM_AUG_1998">{{Cite web |title=SIGNIFICANT WEATHER – AUGUST 1998 |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/inside/services_policy/public/sigwxsum/sigw0898.shtml#rain |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212060121/http://www.bom.gov.au/inside/services_policy/public/sigwxsum/sigw0898.shtml#rain |archive-date=12 February 2008 |access-date=24 February 2008 |publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Meteorology]]}}</ref><ref name="GSB_WF">{{Cite web |title=Geography Stimulus Booklet – Wollongong Floods |url=http://www.wollongong.nsw.gov.au/Documents/Student_broadsheet.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627115002/http://www.wollongong.nsw.gov.au/Documents/Student_broadsheet.pdf |archive-date=27 June 2008 |access-date=24 February 2008}}</ref> Wollongong also experiences [[thunderstorm]]s during the warmer months bringing [[lightning]], heavy rain and occasionally [[hail]].

== Urban structure ==
[[File:Apartment buildings in Wollongong August 2020.jpg|thumb|Wollongong city centre]]

The [[inner city]] area includes the suburbs of Wollongong and [[North Wollongong, New South Wales|North Wollongong]], extending from Fairy Meadow in the north, west to include the [[Wollongong Hospital]], and south to the [[Greenhouse Park]]. At the {{CensusAU|2016}}, the suburb of Wollongong had a population of 18,442.<ref>{{Census 2016 AUS | id = SSC14358| name = Wollongong (state suburb)|quick=on|access-date=16 July 2017}}</ref>

[[File:Crown Street, Wollongong 20220619110018.jpg|thumb|[[Crown Street, Wollongong|Crown Street]]]]

The CBD is a major commercial hub containing many department stores and specialty shops, offices, and entertainment venues. It is centred on the [[Crown Street, Wollongong#Crown Street Mall|Crown Street Mall]] and [[Wollongong Central]], and approximates the area bounded by Market, Corrimal, and Burelli streets and the [[Illawarra railway line|railway line]]. Surrounding the CBD lies a mixture of parks, reserves, light commercial property, houses and multi-story residential units. Multi-story housing is evident particularly on Smith's Hill, north-east of the CBD, reflecting the popularity of combining inner-city living, coastal views and a beachside lifestyle.
To the east of the city lies Flagstaff Point, a rocky headland with eroded low cliffs topped by a grassy hill. The northern side of the point was excavated by convict labour to form Belmore Basin. This was later extended with the northern breakwater to create Wollongong Harbour. The area is the site of a historic colonial [[Flagstaff Hill Fort|fort]], several restored cannons and two lighthouses, a feature peculiar to the east coast of Australia. The older [[Wollongong Breakwater Lighthouse]] located at the harbour entrance was made of wrought iron plates in 1871 and has become an icon of the city. The newer [[Wollongong Head Lighthouse]] was constructed in 1936 atop the Flagstaff Hill and is still used in the early 21st century. Belmore Basin houses the commercial fishing fleet and Fisherman's Co-op, while the main harbour shelters private vessels.

The main beaches of central Wollongong are North Wollongong (or simply North [gong]) Beach, extending from the harbour up to the Fairy lagoon and [[Puckeys Estate Reserve]], and Wollongong City Beach, extending south from Flagstaff Point and into Coniston Beach.

==Demographics==
The Wollongong metropolitan area includes the suburbs, outlying towns and rural localities stretching from [[Helensburgh, New South Wales|Helensburgh]] in the north to [[Kiama]] in the south. According to the [[2021 Australian census|2021 census]], it had a population of 305,691 people. 
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 3.6% of the population.
* 76.3% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 3.9%, North Macedonia 1.3%, New Zealand 1.1%, Italy 0.9% and India 0.9%.
* 81.7% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Macedonian 2.0%, Italian 1.1%, Arabic 1.1% , Mandarin 0.8%, and Spanish 0.8%.
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 38.0%, Catholic 23.3% and Anglican 13.6%.
* 5.1% of employed people worked in Hospitals (except Psychiatric Hospitals). Other major industries of employment included Other Social Assistance Services 3.1%, Aged Care Residential Services 2.8%, Supermarket and Grocery Stores 2.6% and Takeaway Food Services 2.5%.<ref name="ABSSUAMAP">{{Cite web |title=2021 Wollongong, Census All persons QuickStats {{!}} Australian Bureau of Statistics |url=https://www.abs.gov.au/census/find-census-data/quickstats/2021/1036 |access-date=2023-05-27 |website=www.abs.gov.au}}</ref>

Wollongong is continuing to grow with a population growth of 3.1% for the period 2001 to 2006, although the supply of new residential land is limited by the geography particularly in the northern suburbs. The west [[Dapto, New South Wales|Dapto]] area is a major centre of future growth with plans for 19,000 new dwellings and 50,000 people within 40 years.<ref name="WCC_WestDapto">{{Cite web |title=West Dapto |url=http://www.wollongong.nsw.gov.au/planning/westdapto.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080722053531/http://www.wollongong.nsw.gov.au/planning/westdapto.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=22 July 2008 |access-date=16 January 2009 |publisher=[[City of Wollongong|Wollongong City Council]]}}</ref><ref name="WCC_WestDaptoImp">{{Cite web |title=West Dapto Implementation |url=http://www.wollongong.nsw.gov.au/planning/3483.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723023527/http://www.wollongong.nsw.gov.au/planning/3483.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=23 July 2008 |access-date=16 January 2009 |publisher=[[City of Wollongong|Wollongong City Council]]}}</ref> New residential areas are also being developed further south around the [[Albion Park, New South Wales|Albion Park]], [[Shell Cove, New South Wales|Shell Cove]] and [[Kiama, New South Wales|Kiama]] areas.

Wollongong has a distinctly multicultural population. Many migrants were attracted to the area by the job opportunities at the [[Port Kembla, New South Wales|Port Kembla]] steelworks in the [[Post war immigration to Australia|post-war period]], and settled in surrounding suburbs such as [[Cringila, New South Wales|Cringila]], [[Warrawong, New South Wales|Warrawong]] and [[Coniston, New South Wales|Coniston]]. By 1966 about 60% of the wage earners at the Australian Iron and Steel steelworks were born overseas coming from over 100 countries.<ref name="HoW" /> These included [[British Australian|British]], [[Irish Australian|Irish]], [[Macedonian Australian|Macedonians]], [[Spanish Australians|Spaniards]], [[Portuguese Australian|Portuguese]], [[Greek Australian|Greeks]], [[Italian Australian|Italians]], [[Arab Australians|Arabs]], [[Russian Australians|Russians]], [[Bosnian Australian|Bosnians]], [[Croatian Australian|Croatians]], [[Serbian Australian|Serbians]], [[German Australian|Germans]], [[Turkish Australian|Turks]], [[Lebanese Australian|Lebanese]], [[Chilean Australian|Chileans]] and [[Brazilian Australians|Brazilians]].<ref name="HoW" /> With the end of the [[White Australia policy]] these were followed by Indo-Chinese refugees in the 1970s, [[Indian Australian|Indians]], [[Filipino Australian|Filipinos]], [[Chinese Australian|Chinese]], [[Japanese Australians|Japanese]], [[Malaysian Australian|Malaysians]], [[Singaporean Australian|Singaporeans]], [[Korean Australians|Koreans]], [[Vietnamese Australians|Vietnamese]], [[Cambodian Australians|Cambodians]], and [[South Sea Islanders|Pacific Islanders]] in the 1980s and 1990s.<ref name="HoW" /> The [[University of Wollongong]] continues to attract students and staff from all over the world, with around 5,000 overseas student enrolments and countless overseas professors working there.<ref name="UoW_stats" />

==Politics and government==
[[File:Wollongong City Council Admin Building.JPG|thumb|200x200px|Wollongong City Council]]

Two federal [[Divisions of the Australian House of Representatives|divisions]] in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] are mostly or entirely located in Greater Wollongong: [[Division of Cunningham|Cunningham]] and [[Division of Whitlam|Whitlam]], with a very small portion of [[Division of Gilmore|Gilmore]] being in the far southern suburbs of the city. On the state level, there are four [[Electoral districts of New South Wales|electoral districts]] of the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] that are mostly or entirely located in Wollongong: [[Electoral district of Heathcote|Heathcote]], [[Electoral district of Keira|Keira]], [[Electoral district of Shellharbour|Shellharbour]] and [[Electoral district of Wollongong|Wollongong]], with a very small portion of [[Electoral district of Kiama|Kiama]] being in the far southern suburbs of the city.

[[File:WollongongCourtHouse.JPG|thumb|Wollongong Court House|200x200px]]

The city of Wollongong has traditionally voted for the [[centre-left]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] over the [[centre-right]] [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]]. Labor holds both of the two federal seats mostly or entirely located in Wollongong, as well as all four of the state seats that are mostly or entirely located in Wollongong. However, the Liberal Party has held the Wollongong-based state seat of Heathcote multiple times (including for 12 consecutive years from the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]]'s [[2011 New South Wales state election|2011]] [[landslide victory]] until Labor's return to power in [[2023 New South Wales state election|2023]], note that [[Redistribution (Australia)|redistribution]] made Heathcote a notional Labor seat as it moved south to included more of Wollongong and less of southern Sydney). However, even in 2011 (when Labor suffered the worst defeat of a sitting New South Wales government in the state's history and the Coalition won the largest [[majority government]] in the state's history), Labor still won every Wollongong-based seat except Heathcote, making the Illawarra the only region in the state where Labor won more seats than the Coalition. The last time the Liberals won a Wollongong-based state seat other than Heathcote was in [[1968 New South Wales state election|1968]], when the Coalition won the seat of Wollongong for one term before Labor regained it in [[1971 New South Wales state election|1971]].

On the local level, there are two Wollongong-based [[Local government in New South Wales|local government areas]] (LGAs): the [[City of Wollongong]] and the [[City of Shellharbour]], with a very small portion of the [[Municipality of Kiama]] being located in the far southern suburbs of the city. The City of Wollongong is represented by a directly-elected [[List_of_mayors_and_lord_mayors_of_Wollongong|Lord Mayor]] (currently Tania Brown) and 12 councillors (four each per ward): with [[NSW Labor Party|Labor]] having eight seats, [[The Greens NSW|the Greens]] having three and the remaining two seats being held by independents Andrew Anthony and Ryan Morris. The City of Shellharbour has an indirectly-elected [[Mayor of Shellharbour|Mayor]] (currently independent [[Chris Homer]]) and eight councillors: four generic independents, three Labor councillors and one councillor from the [[List of local government political parties in Australia|Kellie Marsh Independent Team]].

==Education==
[[File:UOW Smart Infrastructure Facility.jpg|thumb|The [[SMART Infrastructure Facility]], on the [[University of Wollongong]] campus]]

===Tertiary and further education===

There are two campuses of the [[Illawarra Institute of TAFE]]. The Wollongong Campus is the network's largest campus, and it offers a variety of courses.

Wollongong has one university, the [[University of Wollongong]], which was formerly part of the [[University of New South Wales]]. The University was awarded the "Australian University of the Year" in two consecutive years (1999–2000, 2000–2001) by the Good Universities Guide, and is internationally recognised.<ref name="UoW_awards">{{Cite web|title=Awards and Achievements|url=http://www.uow.edu.au/about/awards/index.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217073543/http://www.uow.edu.au/about/awards/index.html|archive-date=17 December 2008|access-date=2 January 2009|publisher=[[University of Wollongong]]|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It has two main campuses: the primary campus on Northfields Avenue, and the Innovation Campus on Squires Way. The University's Sydney Business School also has a secondary campus in [[Sydney]].

===Schools===
Wollongong has a number of primary and high schools, including public, denominational and independent.

==Media==
Wollongong has one daily newspaper, ''[[The Illawarra Mercury]]'', published and issued Monday to Saturday by [[Australian Community Media]] (ACM).
