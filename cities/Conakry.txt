A port city, it serves as the economic, financial and cultural centre of Guinea. Its population as of the 2014 Guinea census was 1,660,973.<ref>{{Cite web |title=GeoHive ‚Äì Guinea population statistics |work=geohive.com |access-date=5 June 2016 |url=http://www.geohive.com/cntry/guinea.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124030052/http://www.geohive.com/cntry/guinea.aspx |archive-date=24 November 2015}}</ref>

The current population of Conakry is difficult to ascertain, although the U.S. Department of State's [[Bureau of African Affairs]] has estimated it at two million, accounting for one-sixth of the entire population of the country.<ref name="US DoS" />

== History ==
{{See also|Timeline of Conakry}}
[[File:Konakry-Vue g√©n√©rale.jpg|thumb|left|The city in 1912]]
Conakry was originally settled on the small Tombo Island and later spread to the neighboring Kaloum Peninsula, a {{convert|36|km|mi|adj=mid|-long|sp=us}} stretch of land {{convert|0.2|to|6|km|mi|frac=8|sp=us}} wide. The city was essentially founded after Britain ceded the island to France in 1887.<ref>Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 89</ref> In 1885 the two island villages of Conakry and Boubinet had fewer than 500 inhabitants. Conakry became the capital of [[French Guinea]] in 1904 and prospered as an export port, particularly after a railway (now closed) to [[Kankan]] opened up the interior of the country for the large-scale export of [[peanut|groundnut]].

In the decades after independence, the population of Conakry boomed, from 50,000 inhabitants in 1958 to 600,000 in 1980, to over two million today.<ref name="Manning" /> Its small land area and relative isolation from the mainland, while an advantage to its colonial founders, has created an infrastructural burden since independence.<ref name="World Bank" />

[[File:Conakry - franz√∂sischer Gouverneurspalast - 1956.jpg|thumb|left|Conakry ‚Äì French Governor's Palace in 1956]]

In 1970, conflict between Portuguese forces and the belligerent [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde|PAIGC]] independence campaigners in neighbouring [[Portuguese Guinea]] (now [[Guinea-Bissau]]) spilled into the Republic of Guinea when a group of 350 Portuguese troops and Guinean loyalists landed near Conakry, [[Portuguese invasion of Guinea, 1970|attacked the city]] and freed 26 Portuguese [[prisoners of war]] held by the PAIGC before retreating, having failed to overthrow the government or kill the PAIGC leadership.<ref name="Time" />

[[Camp Boiro]], a feared concentration camp during the rule of [[Sekou Toure]], was located in Conakry.<ref>{{cite book |title=La Guin√©e peut-elle √™tre chang√©e? |first=Als√©ny Ren√© |last=Gomez |publisher=Editions L'Harmattan |year=2010 |isbn=978-2-296-11963-5}}</ref>

According to human rights groups, 157 people died during the [[2009 Guinea protest]] when the military junta opened fire against tens of thousands of protesters in the city on 28 September 2009.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8280603.stm |work=BBC News |title=Guinea massacre toll put at 157 |date=29 September 2009 |access-date=21 March 2012 |archive-date=2 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002232605/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8280603.stm |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Geography ==
Originally situated on [[Tombo Island]], one of the [[√éles de Los]], it has since spread up the neighboring Kaloum Peninsula.

=== Climate ===
According to [[K√∂ppen climate classification]], Conakry features a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[K√∂ppen climate classification]]: ''Am''). Conakry features a [[wet season]] and a [[dry season]]. Like most of West Africa, Conakry's dry season is dominated by the [[harmattan]] wind between December and April. As a result, almost no rain falls in the city during these months.

Compared to most of West Africa, Conakry's wet season sees an extraordinary amount of rainfall, averaging more than {{convert|1,100|mm|in|0}} in both July and August. As a result, Conakry's average annual rainfall totals nearly {{convert|3,800|mm|in|0}}. However, the dry season is still dry, with January and February only receiving {{convert|1|mm|in|0}} of rainfall on average. Sunshine is lower in the wet season than the dry season, with August receiving the least sunshine and March receiving the most.

}}

== Government and administration ==

Conakry is a special city with a single region and prefecture government. The local government of the city was decentralized in 1991 between five municipal ''communes'' headed by a mayor.<ref name="capitale" /> From the tip in the southwest, these are:

* [[Kaloum]] ‚Äì the city centre
* [[Dixinn]] ‚Äì including the [[Polytechnical Institute of Conakry|University of Conakry]] and many embassies
* [[Ratoma]] ‚Äì known for its nightlife
* [[Matam, Guinea|Matam]]
* [[Matoto]] ‚Äì home to [[Conakry International Airport]].

The five urban communes make up the [[Conakry Region]], one of the eight [[Regions of Guinea]], which is headed by a governor. At the second-tier prefecture level, the city is designated as the '''Conakry Special Zone''', though the prefecture and regional government are one and the same. At an estimated two million inhabitants, it is far and away the largest city in Guinea, making up almost a quarter of the nation's population and making it more than four times bigger than its nearest rival, [[Kankan]].

== Economy ==
[[File:Conakry-ville2.JPG|thumb|300px|A street scene in Conakry]]
Conakry is Guinea's largest city and its administrative, communications, and economic centre. The city's economy revolves largely around the [[Autonomous Port of Conakry|port]], which has modern facilities for handling and storing cargo, through which alumina and bananas are shipped. Manufactures include food products and cement, metal manufactures, and fuel products.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.europaworld.com/entry/gn.ec |title=Europa World Online : Log In |last=www.semantico.com |website=www.europaworld.com |language=en |access-date=29 January 2018 |archive-date=6 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210906184935/https://www.europaworld.com/LOGIN?sessionid=a23f52ba54e8679cfd4873a85087c7e1&authstatuscode=400 |url-status=live }}</ref>

* [[March√© du Niger]]<ref name="HudgensTrillo2003" />

=== Infrastructure crisis ===
Periodic power and water cuts have been a daily burden for Conakry's residents since early 2002. Government and power company officials blame the drought of February 2001 for a failure of the hydro-electric supply to the capital, and a failure of aging machinery for the continuation of the crisis. Critics of the government cite mismanagement, corruption and the withdrawal of the power agency's French partner at the beginning of 2002. {{As of|2007}}, much of the city has no traffic lighting in the overnight hours.<ref name="BBC" />

Popular anger at shortages in Conakry was entwined with anti-government protests, strikes, and violence against the rule of President [[Lansana Cont√©]] and the successive prime ministers [[Cellou Dalein Diallo]] and [[Eug√®ne Camara]] appointed to fill the post after the resignation of Prime Minister [[Fran√ßois Lonseny Fall]] in April 2004. Violence reached a peak in [[2007 Guinean general strike|January‚ÄìFebruary 2007 in a general strike]], which saw over one hundred deaths when the Army confronted protesters.<ref name="relations">''For the relations between the 2007 crisis and infrastructure in Conakry, see:''
