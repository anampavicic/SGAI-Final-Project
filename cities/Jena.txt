Furthermore, there are many institutes of the leading German research societies.

Jena was first mentioned in 1182 and stayed a small town until the 19th century, when industry developed. For most of the 20th century, Jena was a world centre of the optical industry around companies such as [[Carl Zeiss AG|Carl Zeiss]], [[Schott AG|Schott]] and [[Jenoptik]] (since 1990). As one of only a few medium-sized cities in Germany, it has some high-rise buildings in the city centre, such as the [[JenTower]]. These also have their origin in the former Carl Zeiss factory.

Between 1790 and 1850, Jena was a focal point of the German [[Vormärz]] as well as of the student liberal and [[Unification of Germany|unification]] movement and [[German Romanticism]]. Notable persons of this period in Jena were [[Friedrich Schiller]], [[Alexander von Humboldt]],<ref>{{ cite book | last=Daum | first=Andreas W.|author-link=Andreas Daum | year=2024 | title=Alexander von Humboldt: A Concise Biography | location=Trans.

Jena's economy is largely built upon its high-technology infrastructure and research. The precision optical instruments industry is its leading branch to date, although software engineering, other digital businesses, and biotechnology are of growing importance. Furthermore, Jena is also a service hub for its regional environs.

Jena lies in a hilly landscape in the east of Thuringia, within the wide valley of the [[Saale]] river. Due to its rocky landscape, varied substrate and mixed forests, Jena is known in Germany for the wide variety of wild [[orchids]] which can be found within walking distance of the town.<ref>"[https://www.thueringen-entdecken.de/blog/jena-und-orchideen-ein-paradies-fuer-liebhaber-und-wandersleute/ Jena und Orchideen – Ein Paradies für Liebhaber und Wandersleute] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200924165236/https://www.thueringen-entdecken.de/blog/jena-und-orchideen-ein-paradies-fuer-liebhaber-und-wandersleute/ |date=24 September 2020 }}" {{in lang|de}}.

== History ==

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Lobdeburg near Jena by Night.jpg|thumb|Lobdeburg Castle above Lobeda district]]
Until the [[High Middle Ages]], the [[Saale]] was the border between [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] regions in the west and [[Slavs|Slavic]] regions in the east. Owing to its function as a river crossing, Jena was conveniently located. Nevertheless, there were also some more important Saale crossings such as the nearby cities of [[Naumburg (Saale)|Naumburg]] to the north and [[Saalfeld]] to the south, so that the relevance of Jena was more local during the Middle Ages. The first unequivocal mention of Jena was in an 1182 document. The first local rulers of the region were the Lords of [[Lobdeburg]] with their eponymous castle near [[Lobeda]], roughly {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the city centre on the eastern hillside of the Saale valley.

In the 13th century, the Lords of Lobdeburg founded two towns in the valley: Jena on the west bank and Lobeda&nbsp;– which is one of Jena's constituent communities today&nbsp;– {{convert|4|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south on the east bank. Around 1230, Jena received town rights and a regular city grid was established between today's Fürstengraben, Löbdergraben, Teichgraben and Leutragraben. The city got a marketplace, main church, town hall, council and city walls during the late 13th and early 14th centuries making it into a full-fledged town. In this time, the city's economy was based mainly on wine production on the warm and sunny hillsides of the Saale valley. The two monasteries of the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] (1286) and the [[Cistercian]]s (1301) rounded out Jena's medieval appearance.

As the political circumstances in Thuringia changed in the middle of the 14th century, the weakened Lords of Lobdeburg sold Jena to the aspiring [[House of Wettin|Wettins]] in 1331. Jena obtained the [[Gotha]] municipal law and the citizens strengthened their rights and wealth during the 14th and 15th centuries. Moreover, the Wettins were more interested in their residence in the nearby city of [[Weimar]], and so Jena could develop itself relatively autonomously.

=== Early modern period ===
[[File:Jena (Merian).jpg|thumb|Jena in 1650]]
The [[Protestant Reformation]] was brought to the city in 1523. [[Martin Luther]] visited the town to reorganize the clerical relations and Jena became an early centre of his doctrine. In the following years, the Dominican and the [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] convents were attacked by the townsmen and abolished in 1525 (Carmelite) and 1548 (Dominican).

An important step in Jena's history was the foundation of the [[University of Jena|university]] in 1558. Ernestine Elector [[John Frederick, Elector of Saxony|John Frederick the Magnanimous]] founded it, because he had lost his old university in [[Wittenberg]] to the [[House of Wettin|Albertines]] after the [[Schmalkaldic War]]. During the [[Little Ice Age]], [[Viticulture|wine-growing]] declined in the 17th century, so that the new university became one of the most important sources of income for the city. The same century brought a boom in printing business caused by the rising importance of books (and the population's ability to read) in the Lutheran doctrine, and Jena was the second-largest printing location in Germany after [[Leipzig]].

The list of the so-called "[[Seven Wonders of Jena]]" was composed by students of the university at this time, supposedly as a test of local knowledge in order to confirm that a person who claimed to have studied in Jena was actually familiar with the city.

Beginning in the 16th century, the Ernestine dynasty saw many territorial partitions. Initially, Jena remained a part of [[Saxe-Weimar]], but in 1672 it became the capital of its own small duchy ([[Saxe-Jena]]). In 1692, after two dukes ([[Bernhard II, Duke of Saxe-Jena|Bernhard II]] and [[Johann Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Jena|Johann Wilhelm]]), the dukes of Saxe-Jena died out and the duchy became part of [[Saxe-Eisenach]] and, in 1741, of the [[Duchy of Saxe-Weimar]], to which it belonged until 1809. From 1809 to 1918, Jena was part of the Duchy (from 1815 Grand Duchy) of [[Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]], which from 1871 was also part of the [[German Empire]].

=== 18th century ===
[[File:Napoleon.Jena.jpg|thumb|The battle of Jena in 1806]]
Around 1790, the university became the largest and most famous one among the German states and made Jena the centre of the self-centred, idealist philosophy of ‘Ich' (with professors such as [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]]). It was also home to the early [[German Romanticism|Romanticism]] (with poets such as Novalis, the brothers [[August Wilhelm Schlegel|August]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]], and [[Ludwig Tieck]]).<ref>Wulf, Andrea, ''[https://aeon.co/essays/english-romanticism-was-born-from-a-serious-germanomania The First Romantics]'', [[Aeon]], December 20, 2022</ref>

In 1794, the poets [[Goethe]] and [[Schiller]] met at the university and established a long lasting friendship, based on their love of Shakespeare. Consequently, the reputation of the University and the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach as liberal and open-minded, but severely self-absorbed, was established and enhanced.

=== 19th century ===
On 14&nbsp;October 1806, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] fought and defeated the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] army here in the [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt]], near the district of Vierzehnheiligen. Resistance against the French occupation was strong, especially among the students. Many of the students fought in the [[Lützow Free Corps]] in 1813. Two years later, the [[Urburschenschaft]] fraternity was founded in the city.

During the later 19th century, the famous biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]] was professor at the university. The expansion of science and medicine faculties was closely linked to the industrial boom that Jena saw after 1871. The initial spark of industrialization in Jena was the (relatively late) connection to the railway. The [[Saal Railway]] (''Saalbahn'', opened in 1874) was the connection from [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Leipzig]] along the Saale valley to [[Nuremberg]] and the [[Weimar–Gera railway]] (opened 1876) connected Jena with [[Frankfurt]] and [[Erfurt]] in the west as well as [[Dresden]] and [[Gera]] in the east. Famous pioneers of the Jenaer industry were [[Carl Zeiss]] and [[Ernst Abbe]] (with their [[Carl Zeiss AG]]) as well as [[Otto Schott]] ([[Schott AG]]).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Walter|first=Rolf|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fqPstAEACAAJ|title=Carl Zeiss: Zeiss 1905-1945|date=1996|publisher=Böhlau Verlag|isbn=978-3-412-11096-3|pages=18|language=de}}</ref> Since that time, production of optical items, precision machinery and laboratory glassware have been the main branches of Jena's economy; [[Jena glass]] is even named after the city. Zeiss, Abbe and Schott worked also as social reformers who wanted to improve the living conditions of their workers and the local wealth in general. When Zeiss died in 1889, his company passed to the [[Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung]], which uses great amounts of the company's profits for social benefits such as research projects at universities etc. This model became an example for other German companies (e.g. the [[Robert Bosch Stiftung]]). In 1898 it was agreed on with several personalities from the Jenaer industrial sector that the city was in need of an electricity generator<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Walter|first=Rolf|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fqPstAEACAAJ|title=Carl Zeiss: Zeiss 1905-1945|date=1996|publisher=Böhlau Verlag|isbn=978-3-412-11096-3|pages=25|language=de}}</ref> and in the first years of the 1900s an electrified tramway was founded in Jena.<ref name=":0" />

=== 20th century ===
[[File:Jena Zeiss Bau 15.jpg|thumb|Bau 15 of the Carl Zeiss factory, Germany's first high-rise building, established in 1915]]
Industrialization fundamentally changed the social structure of Jena. The former academic town became a working-class city; the population rose from 8,000 around 1870 up to 71,000 at the beginning of [[World War II]]. The city expanded along the Saale valley to the north and the south and its side valleys to the east and the west. In 1901, the [[tram]] system started its operation and the university got a new main building (established between 1906 and 1908 on the former castle's site). After the foundation of [[Thuringia]] in 1920, Jena was one of the three biggest cities (together with [[Weimar]] and [[Gera]], while [[Erfurt]] remained part of [[Free State of Prussia|Prussia]]) and became an [[independent city]] in 1922. The modern optical and glass industry kept booming and the city grew further during [[Weimar Republic|Weimar times]].

[[File:Jena 700 Jahre Stadt poster (1936).jpg|thumb|left|1936 poster marking the 700th anniversary of the city of Jena]]
During the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] period, conflicts deepened in Jena between the influential left-wing milieus (communists and social democrats) and the right-wing Nazi milieus. On the one hand, the university suffered from new restrictions against its independence, but on the other hand, it consolidated the Nazi ideology, for example with a professorship of social anthropology (which sought to scientifically legitimize the [[racial policy of Nazi Germany]]). [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938 led to more discrimination against [[Jew]]s in Jena, many of whom either emigrated or were arrested and murdered by the German government. This weakened the academic milieu, because many academics were Jews (especially in medicine). During [[World War II]], the Germans operated two [[List of subcamps of Buchenwald|subcamps]] of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] in the city,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tenhumbergreinhard.de/1933-1945-lager-1/1933-1945-lager-j/jena-leutrastrae-32.html|title=Jena Leutrastraße 32|access-date=21 February 2021|language=de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tenhumbergreinhard.de/1933-1945-lager-1/1933-1945-lager-j/jena-loebstedter-strae-50.html|title=Jena Löbstedter Straße 50|access-date=21 February 2021|language=de}}</ref> and a subcamp of the prison in [[Sieradz]] in [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|German-occupied Poland]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Studnicka-Mariańczyk|first=Karolina|year=2018|title=Zakład Karny w Sieradzu w okresie okupacji hitlerowskiej 1939–1945|journal=Zeszyty Historyczne|language=pl|volume=17|page=187}}</ref>

In 1945, toward the end of [[World War II]], Jena was repeatedly targeted by [[Strategic bombing during World War II|Allied bombing raids]]. 709 people were killed, 2,000 injured, and most of the medieval town centre was destroyed, but in parts restored after the end of the war. No other Thuringian city suffered worse damage, except [[Nordhausen, Thuringia|Nordhausen]], whose destruction was utter. Today most of the city consists of buildings from before World War II.<ref>https://zensus2011.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Publikationen/Aufsaetze_Archiv/2015_12_NI_GWZ_endgueltig.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4 {{Bare URL inline|date=August 2024}}</ref> Jena was occupied by [[United States Armed Forces|American troops]] on 13 April 1945 and was left to the [[Red Army]] on 1 July 1945.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

Jena fell within the [[Occupation of Germany|Soviet zone of occupation]] in post-World War II Germany. In 1949, it became part of the new [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] (GDR). The Soviets dismantled great parts of the Zeiss and Schott factories and took them to the [[Soviet Union]]. On the other hand, the GDR government founded a new [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]] factory in 1950, [[Jenapharm]], which is part of [[Bayer]] today. In 1953, Jena was a centre of the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|East German Uprising]] against GDR policy. The protests with 30,000 participants drew fire from Soviet [[tank]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

[[File:Der_Holzmarkt_in_der_Jenaer_Innenstadt.jpg|thumb|Typical street scenery in Jena: The "Holzmarkt" in the city-centre]]
The following decades brought some radical shifts in city planning. During the 1960s, another part of the historic city centre was demolished to build the [[Jen Tower]]. The Eichplatz in front of the tower is still unbuilt and its future is still the subject of ongoing heated discussion. Big [[Plattenbau]] settlements were developed in the 1970s and 1980s, because the population was still rising and the housing shortage remained a perpetual problem. New districts established in the north (near Rautal) and in the south (around Winzerla and Lobeda). The opposition against the GDR government was reinforced during the late 1980s in Jena, fed by academic and clerical circles. In autumn 1989, the city saw the largest protests in its history before the GDR government was dissolved.

After 1990, Jena became part of the refounded state of [[Thuringia]]. Industry came into a heavy crisis during the 1990s, but finally it managed the transition to the [[market economy]] and today, it is one of the leading economic centres of eastern Germany. Furthermore, the university was enlarged and many new research institutes were founded.

Especially between 1995 and 1997 several far-right crimes were committed in Jena. The city's far-right scene of the 1990s gave rise to the [[National Socialist Underground]] (NSU) terror group. However, the city is no longer considered a far-right hotspot.

=== Topography ===
[[File:Burgauer Brücke.jpg|thumb|left|The medieval bridge across the Saale in Burgau district]] 
Jena is situated in a hilly landscape in eastern Thuringia at the [[Saale]] river, between the [[Harz]] mountains {{convert|85|km|0|abbr=on}} in the north, the [[Thuringian Forest]]/[[Thuringian Highland]] {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} in the southwest and the [[Ore Mountains]], {{convert|75|km|0|abbr=on}} in the southeast. The municipal terrain is hilly with rugged slopes at the valley's edges. The city centre is situated at 160 m of elevation, whereas the mountains on both sides of Saale valley rise up to 400 m. On the eastern side those are (from north to south): the ''Gleisberg'' near Kunitz, the ''Jenzig'' near Wogau, the ''Hausberg'' near Wenigenjena, the ''Kernberge'' near Wöllnitz, the ''[[Johannisberg (Jena-Lobeda)|Johannisberg]]'' near Lobeda and the ''Einsiedlerberg'' near Drackendorf. On the western side, there are the ''Jägersberg'' near [[Zwätzen]], the ''Windknollen'' north of the city centre, the ''Tatzend'' west of the city centre, the ''Lichtenhainer Höhe'' near Lichtenhain, the ''Holzberg'' near Winzerla, the ''Jagdberg'' near Göschwitz and the Spitzenberg near Maua. The mountains belong to the geological formation of Ilm Saale Plate ([[Muschelkalk]]) and are relatively flat on their peaks but steep to the valleys in between. Due to its jagged surface, the municipal territory isn't very suitable for agriculture all the more since the most flat areas along the valley were built on during the 20th century. At the mountains is some forest of different leaf trees and pines.

=== Ecology ===
32 species of native [[orchids]] can be found in the Jena area.<ref>[Thüringen Entdecken - Jena und Orchideen – Ein Paradies für Liebhaber und Wandersleute]</ref> One of the best places to see them is [[Naturschutzgebiet Leutratal und Cospoth|Leutratal]], to the south of the town. Bee orchid ''([[Ophrys apifera]]'') even grows at a few locations within the town. On the ''Hausberg'' close to Ziegenhain a few specimens of the rare true service tree (''[[Cormus domestica]]'') can be found. [[Firefly]] can be seen in the meadows in Paradiespark as well as a variety of native wildflowers. Wildlife on the surrounding mountains includes [[Common raven|raven]], [[sand lizard]] and [[wood ants]]. [[Grey heron|Heron]], [[Eurasian beaver|beaver]] and [[muskrat]] have been seen on the Saale, within the town. [[Pine marten]]s sometimes come into the town at night, from the mountains, to raid bins. It is documented that the [[European wildcat]] occurs near Jena.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2023-04-27|date=2019-11-05|language=de-DE|title=Schön und gefährdet: Den Wildkatzen bei Jena auf der Spur|url=https://www.thueringer-allgemeine.de/regionen/jena/schoen-und-gefaehrdet-den-wildkatzen-bei-jena-auf-der-spur-id227562183.html|website=Thüringer Allgemeine}}<!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator --></ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Cebulla |first=David |title=Die Rückkehr der Wildkatze |date=2020-04-17 |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12117538/?ref_=nm_knf_t_3 |type=Documentary, Short |access-date=2023-05-16}}</ref>

=== Administrative division ===
Jena abuts the district of [[Saale-Holzland-Kreis|Saale-Holzland]] with the municipalities of [[Lehesten, Saale-Holzland|Lehesten]], [[Neuengönna]], and [[Golmsdorf]] in the north, [[Jenalöbnitz]], [[Großlöbichau]], and [[Schlöben]] in the east and [[Laasdorf]], [[Zöllnitz]], [[Sulza]], [[Rothenstein, Germany|Rothenstein]], [[Milda, Germany|Milda]], and [[Bucha, Saale-Holzland|Bucha]] in the south and the district of [[Weimarer Land]] with the municipalities of [[Döbritschen]], [[Großschwabhausen]], and [[Saaleplatte]] in the west.

The city is divided into 30 districts. The inner-city districts are Zentrum, Nord, West, Süd, Wenigenjena (east of Saale, incorporated in 1909), and Kernberge, other big districts are Lobeda (incorporated in 1946) and Winzerla (incorporated in 1922) in the south with large housing complexes.

The residual districts are from a more rural constitution:

Over the centuries, Jena had mostly been a town of 4,000 to 5,000 inhabitants. The population growth began in the 19th century with an amount of 6,000 in 1840 and of 8,000 in 1870. Then, a demographic boom occurred with a population of 20,000 in 1900, 50,000 in 1920, 73,000 in 1940, 81,000 in 1960 and 104,000 in 1980. The peak was reached in 1988 with a population of 108,000. The bad economic situation in eastern Germany after the reunification resulted in a decline in population, which fell to 99,000 in 1998 before rising again to 107,000 in 2012.

The average population growth between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 0.47% p. a, whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Jena. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders.

The birth surplus was 62 in 2012, or +0.6 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was +4.0 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).<ref>According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]</ref> The most important regions of origin of Jena migrants are rural areas of Thuringia, [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Saxony]] as well as foreign countries such as Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, Romania, and Bulgaria.

Like many other eastern German cities, Jena has a small foreign-born population: circa 4.0% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 6.2% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Jena are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]], [[Chinese people in Germany|Chinese]] and [[Ukrainians in Germany|Ukrainians]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved: the unemployment rate declined from 14% in 2005 to 7% in 2013. Due to the official policy of atheism in the former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 15.9% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 6.6% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Cityscape ===
Most of the city consists of buildings from before World War II. The historic city centre is located inside the former wall (which is the area between Fürstengraben in the north, Löbdergraben in the east, Teichgraben in the south and Leutragraben in the west). There are only a few historic buildings in this area (e.g. at Oberlauengasse), due to the destruction during World War II and modernization projects in the following decades. The Eichplatz, a big sub-used square covering a large amount of the centre, has not been built on since the 1960s and the discussion about its future is still in process. The wall's defortification took place relatively early in the 18th century – and the first suburbs developed in front of the former city gates. In these areas, some historic building structures from the 18th and early 19th century remained in western Bachstraße and Wagnergasse, in northern Zwätzengasse and in southern Neugasse.

The later 19th and early 20th centuries brought a construction boom to Jena, with the city enlarged to the north and south along the Saale valley, to the west along ''Mühltal'' and on the Saale's east side in former Wenigenjena. Compared with the city centre, later substantial losses were much slighter in this areas. During the interwar period, the construction of flats stayed on a high level but suitable ground got less, so that new housing complexes were set up relatively far away from the centre – a problem that remained until today with long journeys and high rents as consequences. Today's Jena is not as compact as other cities in the region, and urban planning is still a challenge.

A peculiarity of Jena is the presence of a second old town centre with a market square, town hall, and castle in the former town of Lobeda, which is a district since 1946, located approximately {{convert|4|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south of Jena's centre.

=== Sights and architectural heritage ===

Also, the city's basketball team, [[Science City Jena]] played in [[Basketball Bundesliga]] in 2007–2008 season and returned to top level in 2015–16 season. In addition, since 2000, the university of Jena has a rugby team. Since 2012, the [[USV Rugby Jena]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usvjena.de/rugby.html|title=USV Jena: Rugby|first=USV Jena|last=e.V.|website=www.usvjena.de|access-date=8 June 2017|archive-date=9 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609182757/http://www.usvjena.de/rugby.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> team has been playing in the [[2. Rugby-Bundesliga]].

Current men's [[javelin throw]] world record (98.48) by [[Jan Železný]] was achieved in Jena.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Das höchste Bürogebäude Ostdeutschlands - der fast 160m hohe Jentower.jpg|thumb|The [[Jen Tower]] is a symbol of East Germany's economy]]
Agriculture plays a small role in Jena, only 40% of the municipal territory are in use for farming (compared to over 60% in [[Erfurt]] and nearly 50% in [[Weimar]]). Furthermore, the [[Muschelkalk]] soil is not very fertile and is often used as pasture for cattle. The only large agricultural area is situated around Isserstedt, Cospeda and Vierzehnheiligen district in the northwest. Wine-growing was discontinued during the [[Little Ice Age]] around 1800, but is now possible again due to [[global warming]]. Nevertheless, the commercial production of wine hasn't yet resumed.

Industry is a great tradition in Jena, reaching back to the mid-19th century. In 2012, there were 80 companies in industrial production with more than 20 workers employing 8,300 persons and generating a turnover of more than 1,5 billion Euro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=gg000602|title=Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik|first=Thüringer Landesamt für|last=Statistik|website=www.tls.thueringen.de}}</ref> The most important branches are precision machinery, pharmaceuticals, optics, biotechnology and software engineering. Notable companies in Jena are the traditional [[Carl Zeiss AG]], [[Schott AG]], [[Jenoptik]] and [[Jenapharm]] as well as new companies such as [[Intershop Communications]], [[Analytik Jena]], and [[Carl Zeiss Meditec]]. Jena has the most market-listed companies and is one of the most important economic centres of east Germany.

With companies such as Intershop Communications, [[Salesforce.com]] (after the acquisition of [[Demandware]]) and [[ePages]] as well as several web agencies, Jena is a hub for [[E-commerce]] in Germany. Other IT players with regional offices include [[Accenture]] or [[ESET]]. [[Jena-Optronik]], a subsidiary of the [[Airbus Group]], develops components for spaceflight or satellites in Jena.

The city is among Germany's 50 fastest growing regions, with many internationally renowned research institutes and companies, a comparatively low unemployment and a young population structure. Jena was awarded the title "Stadt der Wissenschaft" (city of science) by the ''Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft'', a German science association, in 2008.

Jena is also a hub of public and private services, specially in education, research and business services. Other important institutions are the High Court of Thuringia and Thuringia's solely university hospital. Furthermore, Jena is a regional centre in infrastructure and retail with many shopping centres.

Together with the photonics lab [https://www.uni-jena.de/Forschungsmeldungen/FM170324_Open_Innovation_Photonik.html Lichtwerkstatt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204124033/https://www.uni-jena.de/Forschungsmeldungen/FM170324_Open_Innovation_Photonik.html |date=4 February 2018 }} and the Krautspace there are [[makerspace]]s and [[hackerspace]]s enabling start-ups to create their product ideas and realizing their first prototype and business models as well as networking.

=== Transport ===

==== By rail ====
[[File:13-05-03-jena-by-RalfR-93.jpg|thumb|Paradies station]]
Jena has no central railway station with connection to all the lines at one point. What is relatively common in many countries is quite unusual for a German city and caused on the one hand by the city's difficult topography and on the other hand by the history, because the two main lines were built by two different private companies. The connection in north–south direction is the [[Saal Railway]] with [[Intercity-Express|ICE]] trains running from [[Berlin]] in the north to [[Munich]] in the south once a day stopping at [[Jena Paradies station|Paradies station]] and local trains to [[Naumburg (Saale)|Naumburg]] and [[Saalfeld]] stopping at [[Jena-Zwätzen station|Zwätzen]], [[Jena Saale station|Saalbahnhof]], Paradies and [[Jena-Göschwitz station|Göschwitz]]. The connection in west–east direction is the [[Weimar–Gera railway]] with regional express trains to [[Göttingen]] (via [[Erfurt]] and [[Weimar]]) and [[Zwickau]], [[Glauchau]], [[Altenburg]] or [[Greiz]] (via [[Gera]]) and local trains between Weimar, Jena and Gera. The express trains stop at [[Jena West station|West station]] near the city centre and Göschwitz, the local trains furthermore at [[Neue Schenke]]. The junction between both lines is the [[Jena-Göschwitz station|Göschwitz station]], approx. {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the city centre.

When the [[Nuremberg–Erfurt high-speed railway]] opened in 2017, the city lost its connection to the long-distance train network. As compensation, there are new regional express train services to [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Leipzig]] in the north, and to [[Nuremberg]] in the south.

==== By road ====
The two [[German autobahns|Autobahnen]] crossing each other nearby at ''Hermsdorf junction'' are the [[Bundesautobahn 4]] (Frankfurt–Dresden) and the [[Bundesautobahn 9]] (Berlin–Munich), which were both built during the 1930s. The A 4 runs quite next to the Lobeda housing complexes and the Leutra district. Therefore, it was rebuilt in the 2000s and got two tunnels to protect the residents and the environment against noise and air pollution. Furthermore, there are two [[Bundesstraße]]n crossing in Jena: the [[Bundesstraße 7]] is a connection to [[Weimar]] in the west and [[Gera]] in the east and the [[Bundesstraße 88]] is a connection along Saale valley to [[Naumburg (Saale)|Naumburg]] in the north and [[Rudolstadt]] in the south. Furthermore, there are some roads to [[Apolda]] via Isserstedt, [[Blankenhain]] via Ammerbach and [[Stadtroda]] via Lobeda. Most parts of city centre inside the former walls are pedestrian areas.

==== By aviation ====
The next local airports to Jena are the [[Erfurt–Weimar Airport]], approx. {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} to the west and the [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]], approx. {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=on}} to the northeast, which both serve mostly for holiday flights to the Mediterranean and other touristic regions. The next major airports are [[Frankfurt Airport]], [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]] and [[Munich Airport]].

==== By bike ====
Despite the hilly terrain in some parts, Jena is a cycling city, due to the many students. Cycling has become more popular in Jena since the 1990s when good quality bike paths began to be built. There are bike lanes along some main streets, though, in comparison to other cities in Germany, there are deficits.

For [[bicycle touring]] there is the "Saale track" ({{langx|de|Saale-Radweg}}) and the "Thuringian city string track" ({{langx|de|Radweg Thüringer Städtekette}}). Both of these connect points of tourist interest: the former along the [[Saale]] valley from [[Fichtel Mountains]] in Bavaria to the [[Elbe]] river near [[Magdeburg]], while the latter follows the medieval [[Via Regia]] closely and runs from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]] and Jena to [[Altenburg]] via [[Gera]].

==== Trams and buses ====
[[File:13-05-03-jena-by-RalfR-04.jpg|thumb|A tram near Jena Paradies Station]]
The [[Trams in Jena|Jena tramway network]] was established in 1901 and enlarged after the German reunification. It connects the major districts with the city centre; there are 5 ordinary lines served in different intervals between 7,5 and 20 minutes. Nevertheless, there are some old single-track segments interfering the services. Furthermore, there is an extensive network of buses, run (such as the trams) by the "Jenah" organization, a pun on Jena and the German {{lang|de|text= Nahverkehr}} lit. 'public transport'. Buses of the JES Verkehrsgesellschaft connect Jena with cities and villages in the region.

=== Education and research ===

After reunification, the educational system was realigned. The [[University of Jena]], established in 1558, was largely extended. Today there are approximately 21,000 students at this university. Another college is the [[Ernst-Abbe-Hochschule Jena]], a [[Fachhochschule|University of Applied Sciences]] founded in 1991 which offers a combination of scientific training and its practical applications. There are also nearly 5,000 students.

Further there are six [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]s, five state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical). One of the state-owned is a ''Sportgymnasium'', an elite boarding school for young talents in athletics or football. Another state-owned Gymnasium (the [[Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena]]) offers a focus in sciences also as an elite boarding school additionally to the common curriculum.

The various research institutes based in Jena include: 
* The [[Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology]] is an important research center and offers a Ph.D. program
