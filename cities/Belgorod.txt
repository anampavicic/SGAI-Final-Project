[[File:Belgorod Smolensky church.JPG|thumb|left|Church of the Theotokos of Smolensk]]
Like many Russian cities, Belgorod began as a fortified settlement. The oldest Belgorod fortress was built at the end of the 16th century on a [[chalk]] mountain. According to scientific excavations and surviving archival data, the first fortress outpost was erected in 1596.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hedclub.com/en/publication/russia_at_a_glance_belgorod_451/en|title=Russia At a Glance. Belgorod|publisher=HED|accessdate=2023-11-01}}</ref> The site of the construction of the defensive facility was the top of the Belaya Gora ("White Mountain"). This is the highest point of the right bank of the Seversky Donets channel. On 17 September 1650, voivode Vasily Petrovich Golovin laid the foundation for the third Belgorod Fortress on the left bank of the Vezenitsa River, which flows into the Seversky Donets.<ref>{{cite book|title=История Белгородской крепости на берегу реки Везелицы в контексте развития геодезического краеведения|lang=ru|author=Сальникова О.Н.}}</ref> In the fall of 1650, a wooden fort with 11 towers was attached to the rampart of the Belgorod line, which runs from the fortress town Bolkhovets to the mouth of the Vezelka River in the area of the former brewery. The two parts of the city were connected by the Nikolskaya Passage Tower located in the eastern wall of the Kremlin. The position of the eastern wall of the Kremlin corresponded to the modern street of the 50th anniversary of the Belgorod Oblast. With the expansion of the borders of the [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian state]], the military significance of the Belgorod fortress gradually decreased and by the middle of the 18th century, only the Kremlin remained from the formidable fortress.<ref>{{cite book|title=Белгород: Очерк о прошлом, настоящем и будущем города|lang=ru|author=П.М. Беляев, А.П. Чиченков|year=1962|pages=150–154}}</ref>
[[File:Male Monastery in Belgorod.jpg|thumb|Men's Monastery in 1911]]

In the fall of 1766, the new governor, Andrei Fliverk pushed for a new city plan. A regular street plan was developed and signed on 18 April 1767. The architect's signature is not legible, but it may have been signed by [[Andrey Kvasov]]. The central part of the plan was occupied by an octahedral "marketplace" with 64 stone shops and 20 warehouse barns. Moskovskaya, Kievskaya, Voronezhskaya and Kharkovskaya streets ran from the trading area in four directions. According to the plan, it was supposed to divide the entire city into 16 quarters, 4 of which should be built up with stone houses, and the rest with wooden and huts. The plan was executed formally without taking into account the buildings that survived the fire, the Kremlin fortress and the terrain.<ref>{{cite book|title=Белгород: Очерк о прошлом, настоящем и будущем города|lang=ru|author=П.М. Беляев, А.П. Чиченков|year=1962|pages=156–158}}</ref> On 28 April 1768, a new plan was developed<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bel.cultreg.ru/overviews/176/istoriya-grazhdanskogo-prospekta-samoi-staroi-ulicy-belgoroda|title=ИСТОРИЯ ГРАЖДАНСКОГО ПРОСПЕКТА — САМОЙ СТАРОЙ УЛИЦЫ БЕЛГОРОДА|lang=ru|accessdate=2023-10-30}}</ref> under the leadership of [[Andrey Kvasov]] who was the author of a number of city plans. The plans overlaid the old city center layout and the projected one. It provided for a trading area, which in the west adjoined the fortress Kremlin, and in the east ended with stone benches of the [[Gostiny dvor]] in the form of two arcs. The central planning axis was also chosen relative to which the directions of mutually [[perpendicular]] streets were formed.{{fact|date=September 2024}}

Travel notes which were published in 1781 showed the location of a sketch of the ramparts of the lost ancient settlement. Only in the middle of the 1950s, the archaeologist [[Arkady Nikitin]] carried out excavations at the site of the first fortress, where the remains of ancient ramparts and ditches were still clearly visible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://historybel.narod.ru/razdor.htm|title=Письмо в редакцию по поводу "1000-летия" г. Белгорода|lang=ru|publisher=historybel.narod.ru|accessdate=2023-11-01}}</ref> though the fortress itself was destroyed already in the 1860s during the construction of the railway the eastern part of the chalk mountain, on which the Kremlin was located, was collapsed. The location of the first fortress approximately corresponded to the location of the modern car market on Byelaya Gora.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Belgorod Krepost|journal=Sovitskaya Archeologia|volume=3|pages=262–264}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title= Путешественныя записки Василья Зуева от С. Петербурга до Херсона в 1781 и 1782 году|lang=ru|author=Зуев, Василий Федорович|year=1762}}</ref>

In the 1780s, during the general survey of the Russian lands, several plans of Belgorod were fulfilled. When drawing up plans, an overlay of the old and new layouts of Kvasov was used. The plans described above give a distorted position of church estates, which were fixed when the city was laid and, as a rule, did not change. The plan, signed by the titular adviser Salkov, is the most accurate plan of Belgorod in the second half of the 18th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ssafro-n.livejournal.com/1049.html|title=КРАСОТА РЕГУЛЯРСТВА|website=ssafro-n.livejournal.com|date=9 January 2013 }}</ref>

===Before the 20th century===
[[File:Belgorod 8 (35226536836).jpg|thumb|Monument to Grand Prince [[Vladimir the Great]] in Belgorod]]
There was a settlement of the [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribe of [[Severians]] in the area, which was probably destroyed at the beginning of the 10th century by the nomadic [[Pechenegs]]. In 965, the lands in the upper reaches of Seversky Donets were annexed to the [[Principality of Pereyaslavl]].

Records first mention the settlement in 1237, when the Mongol-led army of [[Batu Khan]] ravaged it during the [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus']]. It is unclear whether this Belgorod stood on the same site as the current city. In 1596 Tsar [[Feodor I of Russia|Feodor Ioannovich]] of Russia ordered its re-establishment as one of numerous forts set up to [[Muravsky Trail|defend Russian southern borders]] from the [[khanate of Crimea|Crimean Tatars]].<ref name="gr">{{cite book |title= Энциклопедия Города России |year= 2003 |publisher= Большая Российская Энциклопедия |location= Moscow |isbn= 5-7107-7399-9 |page= 39}}</ref> Belgorod was part of a chain of [[Great Zasechnaya cherta|fortification lines]], created by [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia]] to protect it from the [[Crimean–Nogai slave raids in Eastern Europe|Crimean–Nogai slave raids]] that ravaged the southern provinces of the country during the [[Russo-Crimean Wars]].<ref>Khodarkovsky,Michael, "Russia's Steppe Frontier", 2002.</ref> The tsar appointed two princes-governors to supervise the construction of Belgorod: Mikhail Vasilyevich Nozdrovaty and Andrei Romanovich Volkonsky. The first Belgorod fortress was built on the high right bank of the Seversky Donets, in the area of the current car market; the Belgorod Kremlin was close to the present-day Belaya Gora restaurant. The legendary White Mountain has not survived, as it was completely torn down for chalk mining in the 1950s.
[[File:Белгородская крепость.jpg|thumb|Belgorod fortress in the 17th century]]
The first Belgorod fortress stood for sixteen years, withstanding several major attacks, both from the Tatars and from the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish–Lithuanian]] troops who participated in the [[Polish–Muscovite Wars (1605–1618)|wars with the Russian state]] during the [[Time of Troubles]]. In 1612 the Belgorod fortress was taken and burned by a detachment of Lithuanians. The governor, Nikita Likharev, by order of the tsar, was already building the second Belgorod fortress on the opposite bank of the Seversky Donets the following year, 1613. Over the next decades, Belgorodians repulsed a large number of attacks on their lands. By the middle of the 17th century, the question arose about the construction of a new Belgorod fortress three kilometers south of the existing one.

In the 17th century Belgorod suffered repeatedly from [[Black Sea slave trade|Tatar incursions]], against which Russia built (from 1633 to 1740) an earthen wall, with twelve forts, extending upwards of {{convert|200|mi|abbr=off}} from the [[Vorskla River|Vorskla]] in the west to the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] in the east, and called the {{Interlanguage link multi|Belgorod line|ru|3=Белгородская черта}}. In 1666 the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Moscow Patriarchate]] established an [[Diocese of Belgorod and Stary Oskol|archiepiscopal see]] in the town.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Byelgorod |volume=4|page=895}}</ref>

Tsar [[Peter the Great]] visited Belgorod on the eve of the [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709.

After the Russian border moved south following successful wars against the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the second half of the 17th century, the strategic importance of the city gradually decreased, and on 13 May 1785, by decree of [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]], Belgorod was excluded from the number of fortresses of the [[Russian Empire]]. From that moment on, the city plunged into the measured provincial life of the central black earth zone of Russia. Military life was replaced by agricultural life, the number of spiritual, educational, industrial and commercial institutions were growing, and in the historical chronicles of the Russian Empire, the city seems to have fallen asleep for a century. The Belgorod province disappeared from the geographical maps, and the city was for a long time a part of the first [[Kursk Governorate]], then the Kursk province, and, finally, the Kursk region. A [[dragoon]] regiment had its base in the town until 1917. 
[[File:Prokudin-Gorsky. Square in Belgorod, during the celebration of the canonization of Ioasaf of Belgorod, September 4, 1911.jpg|thumb|[[canonization|Glorification]] of [[Joasaph of Belgorod|Joasaph]], Belgorod, 4 September 1911]]
[[Ioasaph of Belgorod]], an 18th-century bishop of Belgorod and Oboyanska, became widely venerated as a miracle worker and was [[Russian Orthodox Church#Canonization|glorified]] as a saint of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in 1911.

===20th and 21st centuries===
[[File:Общий вид старого Белгорода.jpg|thumb|View of Belgorod in 1912]]

Soviet power was established in the city on 26 October (8 November) 1917. On 10 April 1918, troops of the [[Imperial German Army]] occupied Belgorod. After the conclusion of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Ukraine–Central Powers)|Brest-Litovsk peace treaty]] of 9 February 1918 the demarcation line passed to the north of the city. Belgorod became part of the newly proclaimed [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (February to May 1918) and [[Ukrainian State]] headed by [[Hetman]] [[Pavlo Skoropadskyi]].

On 20 December 1918, after the overthrow of German-backed Skoropadskyi, the Soviet [[Red Army]] regained control over the city, which became part of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]]. From 24 December 1918 to 7 January 1919, the [[Provisional Workers' and Peasants' Government of Ukraine]], then led by General [[Georgy Pyatakov]], was based in Belgorod. The city served as the temporary capital of the Ukrainian People's Republic. From 23 June to 7 December 1919, the [[Volunteer Army]] occupied the town as part of [[White movement|White]]-controlled [[South Russia (1919–1920)|South Russia]].

From September 1925, the territorial 163rd Infantry Regiment of the 55th Infantry Division of Kursk was stationed in Belgorod. In September 1939, it was deployed to the 185th Infantry Division.

On 2 March 1935, the [[Presidium of the Central Executive Committee]] of the Soviet Union decided to allocate the city of Belgorod, Kursk region, into an independent administrative unit directly subordinate to the [[Kursk Oblast|Kursk Region]]al Executive Committee.

The German [[Wehrmacht]] occupied Belgorod from 25 October 1941 to 9 February 1943. The Germans operated a [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]] battalion for Jews in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.2&tab=7&id=100002173|title=Jüdisches Arbeitsbataillon Belgorod|website=Bundesarchiv.de|access-date=15 June 2024|language=de}}</ref> The Germans re-captured it on 18 March 1943 in the final move of the [[Third Battle of Kharkov]]. On 12 July 1943, during the [[Battle of Kursk]], the largest [[tank]] battle in world history took place near [[Prokhorovka, Belgorod Oblast|Prokhorovka]], and the Red Army definitively retook the city on 5/6 August 1943. The {{ill|Belgorod Diorama|de|Diorama-Museum „Kursker Schlacht. Gebiet Belgorod“}} is one of the World War II monuments commemorating the event.
<!--  Once again, the name of Belgorod becomes known throughout the country during the difficult wartime of the Great Patriotic War. On 5 August 1943, during the Battle of Kursk, Belgorod and Orel were liberated from the German fascist invaders. On the same day, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin signed his order number 2: "Today, on August 5, at 24 o'clock, the capital of our Motherland, Moscow, will salute our valiant troops that liberated Oryol and Belgorod with twelve artillery salvos from 120 guns." From that moment on, Belgorod bears the unofficial title "The City of the First Fireworks", and the fifth of August is celebrated by modern Belgorodians as the City Day.<ref>https://mkoinov.livejournal.com/53108.html {{Bare URL inline|date=May 2022}}</ref>  -->

Trolleybus city park consisted of 150 pieces of equipment, mainly Russian-made trolley ZiU-682V, 2 units ZiU-683, operated from 1990, and 3 units ZiU-6205, 30 units "Optima", and one trolley Skoda-VSW -14Tr, which started operation in 1996.
