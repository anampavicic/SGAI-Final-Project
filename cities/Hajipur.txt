==Etymology==
The founder of Hajipur, ''[[Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah|Haji Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah]]'s'' tomb is now called as ''Haji-Pir'' and the name of the headquarters of [[Vaishali district]], "Hajipur" emerged from the same word.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.punjabkesari.in/dharm/news/vaishali--haripur--hajipur-563654|title=Ancient name of hajipur is ''Haripur''|date=11 January 2017 |access-date=6 July 2021|archive-date=15 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215201853/http://www.punjabkesari.in/dharm/news/vaishali--haripur--hajipur-563654|url-status=live}} punjabkesari.in</ref><ref name=na/><ref name=ou>{{Cite web|title=About ancient name of hajipur|url=https://www.outlookhindi.com/art-and-culture/diary/shaharnama-maalbhog-kela-hajipur-57748|access-date=2021-06-17|language=en|archive-date=25 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210425061559/https://www.outlookhindi.com/art-and-culture/diary/shaharnama-maalbhog-kela-hajipur-57748|url-status=live}} ''outlookhindi.com''</ref>

==History==
In ancient times, Hajipur was known as '''Ukkacala'''<ref>{{cite book|title=Prajñā-bhāratī|publisher=K.P. Jayaswal Research Institute|pages=175–178|volume=6|year=1992}}</ref> and was the first village after crossing the [[Ganges|Ganga]] at Patna. The village of Hajipur gained significance, as it was the venue of one of the discourses given by [[Buddha]]. Buddha preached the ''Cula Gopalaka Sutta'', a Middle Length Discourse, here. Along with that, it is also of interest because a portion of [[Ananda]]'s ashes were [[enshrined]] in the town. Ananda, the closest disciple of Buddha, acted as the Buddha's attendant for twenty years and outlived him by several [[decades]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vaishali.nic.in|title=About history of hajipur|access-date=6 July 2021|archive-date=10 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210610085231/https://vaishali.nic.in/|url-status=live}} vaishali.nic.in</ref><ref name=ou/> Hajipur is also known for the land of '''Amrapali'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jlcollegehajipur.ac.in/about-us/about/|title=Hajipur is the land of Amrapali|access-date=1 March 2022|archive-date=2 March 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220302153121/https://www.jlcollegehajipur.ac.in/about-us/about/|url-status=live}} jlcollegehajipur.ac.in</ref>

In [[British India]], Hajipur was a small town in the [[Muzaffarpur district]] situated on the confluence of the Ganges and [[Gandaki River|Gandak]]. Hajipur features conspicuously in the history of struggles between [[Emperor Akbar]] and the rebellious Afghan [[Karrani dynasty|Karrani]] rulers of Bengal, being twice besieged and captured by the imperial troops, in 1572 and 1574.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Hajipur|volume=12|page=827}}</ref> In 1912 [[Bihar]] and Orissa was divided from the Presidency of Bengal.

Hence the name- [[Kaunhara ghat]]. Scriptures tell that [[Vishnu|Lord Vishnu]] had to interfere in the fight to save his devotee Gajaraj, who was being drowned by a crocodile. Both Gaja and Graah were [[gandharva]]s. But due to some curse, they became Gaja and Graah. Lord Vishnu killed Graah to give him instant salvation, and saved the life Of Gajaraj."
