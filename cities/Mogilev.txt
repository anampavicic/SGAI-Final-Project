The city was first mentioned in historical records in 1267. From the 14th century, it was part of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], and since the [[Union of Lublin]] (1569), part of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], where it became known as ''Mohylew''. In the 16th-17th centuries, the city flourished as one of the main nodes of the east–west and north–south trading routes.

In 1577, Polish King [[Stefan Batory]] granted it [[Magdeburg law|city rights under Magdeburg law]]. In 1654, during the [[Russo-Polish War (1654–1667)]], the townsmen negotiated a treaty of surrender to the Russians peacefully, if the Jews were to be expelled and their property divided up among Mogilev's inhabitants. [[Alexis of Russia|Tsar Aleksei Mikhailovitch]] agreed. However, instead of expelling the Jews, the Russian troops massacred them after they had led them to the outskirts of the town.<ref>Russia's First Modern Jews, NYU Press 1995, David Fishman, p.2</ref> During this war, the city was besieged twice by the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuanian army]]: [[Siege of Mogilev (1655)|in 1655]], and [[Siege of Mogilev (1660)|in 1660]]. In 1661, {{ill|Mogilev uprising (1661)|lt=local residents started an uprising against the Russian imperial rule|ru|Могилёвское восстание (1661)}}. The city was set afire by [[Peter the Great]]'s forces in 1708, during the [[Great Northern War]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Катлярчук |first=Андрэй |date=2007 |title=Швэды ў гісторыі й культуры беларусаў |publisher=Ėntsyklapedyks |url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:860434/FULLTEXT01.pdf |isbn=978-9856599586 |language=belarusian}}</ref> After the [[Partitions of Poland|First Partition of Poland]] in 1772, Mogilev became part of the [[Russian Empire]] and became the centre of the [[Mogilev Governorate]]. In 1938 it was decided Mogilev was to become the capital of Belarus because Minsk was too close to the then-Polish-Soviet border.

In the years 1915–1917, during [[World War I]], the [[Stavka]], the headquarters of the [[Russian Imperial Army]], was based in the city <ref>Preclík, Vratislav.

Following the [[Russian Revolution]], in 1918, the city was briefly occupied by [[Germany]] and placed under their short-lived [[Belarusian People's Republic]]. In 1919, Mogilev was captured by the forces of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] and incorporated into the [[Byelorussian SSR]]. Up to [[World War II]] and the [[Holocaust]], like many other cities in Europe, Mogilev had a significant [[Jewish diaspora|Jewish]] population: according to the [[Russian census of 1897]], out of the total population of 41,100, 21,500 were Jews (i.e. over 50 percent).<ref>Joshua D. Zimmerman, ''Poles, Jews, and the politics of nationality'', Univ of Wisconsin Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-299-19464-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6sbr9cZyw_4C&dq=population+Brest+Poles+Jews&pg=PA16 Google Print, p.16]</ref> In 1938 the leadership of Soviet Belarus decided to move the capital of the country from Minsk to Mogilev. Due to that, the now-[[:ru:Дом Советов (Могилёв)|Mogilev City Council building]] was built in 1938–1940 with the aim of being the government building. It was designed to resemble the [[Government House, Minsk|Minsk Government building]].

During [[Operation Barbarossa]], the city was conquered by [[Wehrmacht]] forces on 26 July 1941 and remained under [[Nazi Germany|German]] occupation until 28 June 1944.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/nazioccupation/mogilev.html |title=Mogilev The fate of the Jews under the German Invasion & Occupation |publisher=Holocaustresearchproject.org |access-date=2014-08-09}}</ref> Mogilev became the official residence of [[SS and police leader|High SS and police leader]] (HSSPF) [[Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski|Erich von dem Bach]]. During that period, the Jews of Mogilev were [[Mogilev Ghetto|ghettoized]] and systematically murdered by ''[[Ordnungspolizei]]'' and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] personnel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jhrgbelarus.org/AboutBelarus_articles.php |title=Jewish Heritage Research Group in Belarus |publisher=Jhrgbelarus.org |access-date=2014-08-09 |archive-date=2018-10-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002103123/http://www.jhrgbelarus.org/AboutBelarus_articles.php |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Heinrich Himmler]] personally witnessed the executions of 279 Jews on 23 October 1941. Later that month, a number of mentally disabled patients were poisoned with car exhaust fumes as an experiment; the method of killing was thereafter applied in several Nazi [[extermination camp]]s. Initial plans for establishing a death camp in Mogilev were abandoned in favour of [[Maly Trostenets extermination camp|Maly Trostenets]].

In 1944, with the [[Mogilev offensive]], the devastated city was liberated by the [[Red Army]] and returned to Soviet control. Mogilev then was the site of a labour camp for [[German prisoners of war in the Soviet Union|German POW soldiers]].

Since [[Belarus]] gained its independence in 1991, Mogilev has remained one of its principal cities.

== Religion ==
Mohilev was the [[episcopal see]] of the Latin [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mohilev|Catholic Archdiocese of Mohilev]] until its 1991 merger into the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Minsk-Mohilev]].

It remains the see of the [[Eparchy]] (Eastern diocese) of Mogilev and [[Mstsislaw]] in the [[Belarusian Exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church]].
{{Further|St. Nicholas Monastery Complex}}

== Economy ==
After [[World War II]], a huge [[metallurgy]] centre with several major steel mills was built. Also, several major factories of [[crane (machine)|crane]]s, [[car]]s, [[tractor]]s and a chemical plant were established. By the 1950s, tanning was Mogilev's principal industry, and it was a major trading centre for cereal, leather, salt, sugar, fish, timber and flint: the city has been home to a major inland port on the [[Dnieper]] river since and an [[Mahilyow Airport|airport]] since. Since the fall of the Soviet Union and the establishment of Belarus as an independent country, Mogilev has become one of that country's main economic and industrial centres.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.belarus.by/en/about-belarus/geography/mogilev-region|publisher=Govt of Belarus|title=Mogilev Region|website=Belarus.by}}</ref>

==Cityscape==

The town's most notable landmark is the late 17th-century [[town hall]], named the Ratuša (Rathaus), that was built during the times of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The grand tower of the town hall sustained serious damage during the [[Great Northern War]] and the [[Great Patriotic War]]. It was eventually demolished in 1957 and rebuilt in its pre-war form in 2008.

Another important landmark of Mogilev is the six-pillared St. Stanisław's Cathedral, built in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style between 1738 and 1752 and distinguished by its frescoes.

The convent of St. Nicholas preserves its magnificent cathedral of 1668, as well as the original [[iconostasis]], bell tower, walls, and gates. It is currently under consideration to become a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] site.<ref>{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1896/ |title=St. Nicholas Monastery Complex in the city of Mahilyou – UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date=2004-01-30 |access-date=2014-08-09}}</ref>

Minor landmarks include the archiepiscopal palace and memorial arch, both dating from the 1780s, and the enormous theater in a blend of the [[Neo-Renaissance]] and [[Russian Revival]] styles.

At Polykovichi, an urban part of Mogilev, there is a 350 metre tall guyed TV mast, one of the tallest structures in Belarus.
