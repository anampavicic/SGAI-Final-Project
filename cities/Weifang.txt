== History ==
Weifang has a long history. According to archaeological discoveries, there are more than 1,800 [[List of World Heritage Sites in China|ancient cultural sites]] in different times in China. Among them, the first [[Beixin culture|Beixin]] cultural relic in eastern Shandong was found in taoyuan village, Qingzhou; The ancient castle site of [[Longshan culture|Longshan]] culture excavated by Shouguang Bianxian Wang is rare in China. The typical Longshan cultural site in [[:zh:姚官莊|Yaoguanzhuang]], [[Weicheng, Weifang|Weicheng District]] is rich in unearthed relics, far exceeding the excavation of [[Chengziya]] site before liberation.

This shows that as early as 7000 years ago, our ancestors lived here. In [[Xia dynasty|Xia]] and [[Shang dynasty|Shang dynasties]], there were such countries as pouring irrigation, pouring bamboo, cold and three longevity. At the beginning of the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] dynasty, [[King Wu of Zhou|King Wu]] sealed the state and founded the country, and made Tai Gong Wang Yu Qi and Du Yingqiu (now in Changle). To the [[Spring and Autumn period]], the present municipal districts once belonged to [[Qing dynasty|Qi]], Lu, Qi, Ju and other countries. During the Warring States period, most of the current ministries were in harmony, and Wulian and Zhucheng belonged to Shandong.

As early as the [[Neolithic Revolution|Neolithic Age]], there were ancestors living next to the old roads of Weihe River and Mihe River in Weifang. The ancient tribal people living here are called "[[Dongyi|Dongyi people]]". They have created a rich and colorful [[Dongyi|Dongyi culture]], which is one of the sources of [[Chinese culture|Chinese civilization]].

During the [[Eastern Zhou|Eastern Zhou dynasty]], Weifang belonged to the same land, bordering the [[Bohai Sea]] in the north, and it had the advantage of "fish and salt". Counties were established in [[Qin dynasty]], and most of Weifang belonged to Jiaodong County, Qi County and [[Langya Commandery|Langya County]]. In the fifth year of Emperor Yuan Feng of the Han dynasty (106 BC), Qingzhou Secretariat Department was established, which was located in Guang County (located in Qingzhou today). During the Sixteen Kingdoms period of the Eastern Jin dynasty, Murong De, a Xianbei people, established the Southern Yan regime, whose capital was located in Guanggu City (now [[Qingzhou|Qingzhou City]], Weifang), and in the 16th year of Emperor Kai of [[Sui dynasty]] (596), it was located in Weizhou.

During this period, as one of the earliest areas where Buddhism was introduced into the Han dynasty, Weifang became the center of Buddhism in Qilu, leaving a large number of Buddhist cultural relics, such as the hoard of Buddhist statues in longxing temple, Qingzhou and Tuoshan, and the statues in Yunmen Mountain and Shimenfang Grottoes.[[File:German train station 1898.JPG|thumb|A historic German train station in Euro Town, Weifang]]
