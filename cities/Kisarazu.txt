==History==
===Early history===
The area of modern Kisarazu has been inhabited since the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period, and numerous remains from the [[Jōmon period|Jōmon]], [[Yayoi period|Yayoi]] and [[Kofun period]]s have been found within the city limits. The area also is prominent in the [[Yamatotakeru]] mythology. Under the ''[[Ritsuryō]]'' system of the [[Nara period]], the area became part of [[Kazusa Province]]. The area was contested between the [[Later Hōjō clan]],  [[Takeda clan]] and [[Satomi clan]] during the [[Sengoku period]]. During the [[Edo period]] under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], part of the area was under the control of the [[han (administrative division)|feudal domain]] of [[Jōzai Domain|Jōzai]], with large portions as ''[[tenryō]]'' territory controlled directly by the Shogunate and administered by numerous ''[[hatamoto]].''

=== Meiji Restoration and Kisarazu Prefecture ===
Kisarazu was part of the complex reconfiguration of administrative areas at the start of the [[Meiji period]]. In 1871, as part of the [[abolition of the han system]], the [[Sakurai Domain]], located partly in Kisarazu, was abolished and "Sakurai Prefecture" was established.

In November of the same year, the prefecture was combined with the former [[Awa Province (Chiba)|Awa Province]] and [[Kazusa Province]] to form "Kisarazu Prefecture". The prefectural seat was established in the present-day Kaifuchi district of Kisarazu. Kisarazu Prefecture was established two years later in 1873. It was combined with [[Inba Prefecture]] to form present-day Chiba Prefecture. Kisarazu Town, founded on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system.

=== World War II and post-war period ===
Kisarazu was developed as a center for military activity as part of the [[militarization]] of Japan in the 1930s. In 1935-1936 the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], established the [[Kisarazu Air Field]] for the [[Kisarazu Air Group]] on [[landfill]] in the northern part of Kisarazu to protect Tokyo from attack. The base served as an [[arsenal]], and employed up to 17,000 workers during the war.  It was this site that received the remains of Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] after being transported back to Japan aboard {{ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi||6}}. The [[Nakajima Aircraft Company|Nakajima]] [[Nakajima Kikka|''Kikka'']], Japan's first [[jet engine|jet]]-powered aircraft, was tested at the base in 1945. The base was used by the [[United States Air Force]] from 1945 as "Kisarazu Air Base". In 1956, the base was officially transferred to the control of the [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]] (JASDF).

On November 3, 1942. Kisarazu Town, Iwane Village, Kiyokawa Village, and Namioka Village marged to form Kisarazu City. Kisarazu was expanded through merger with neighboring Aoyagi Town on March 31, 1955, and again through merger with Amaha Town and Osawa Town on April 25, 1971.

==Government==
Kisarazu has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 24 members. Kisarazu contributes two members to the Chiba Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of [[Chiba 12th district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

== Economy ==
Kisarazu has a mixed economy based on [[commercial fishing]], agriculture, and heavy industry along its Tokyo Bay shoreline. It serves as the commercial center for central [[Bōsō Peninsula]], and is increasingly a [[bedroom community]] for neighboring Kimitsu and the [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]] – [[Yokohama]] metropolis across [[Tokyo Bay]]. The opening of the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line has also resulted in the creation of a number of factory outlet shopping malls, and the development of [[new town]]s, and land prices increased dramatically in the 1980s through 2000s.
