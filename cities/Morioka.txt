== History ==
[[File:171103 Morioka Castle Morioka Iwate pref Japan20s3.jpg|thumb|Morioka Castle]]
The area of present-day Morioka has been continuously inhabited since the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period. Numerous [[Jōmon period|Jōmon]], [[Yayoi period|Yayoi]] and [[Kofun period]] tombs and remains have been found. The [[Emishi]] inhabited the area into the [[Heian period]]. During the [[Enryaku]] era of the Heian period, [[Sakanoue no Tamuramaro]], was ordered north to [[Shiwa Castle]] in 803 AD, as a military center to extend the domination of the [[Imperial House of Japan|imperial dynasty]] over [[Mutsu Province]]. The area was later ruled by the [[Abe clan]] until their destruction during the [[Former Nine Years War]] at the hands of the [[Minamoto clan|Minamoto]] and [[Kiyohara clan]]s. The Kiyohara were in turn defeated in the [[Gosannen War]] and the area came under the control of the [[Ōshū Fujiwara Clan]] based in [[Hiraizumi, Iwate|Hiraizumi]], to the south of Morioka. After the Ōshū Fujiwara were destroyed by [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] at the start of the [[Kamakura period]], the area was disputed by several samurai clans until the [[Nanbu clan]], based in [[Sannohe Castle|Sannohe]] to the north, expanded their territory during the [[Sengoku period]] and built [[Kozukata|Kozukata Castle]] in 1592.

Following the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] and the formal recognition of [[Morioka Domain]] under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], Kozukata Castle was renamed [[Morioka Castle]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Dijitaru Daijisen | script-title = ja:不来方 | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ | access-date = 2013-02-01 | year = 2013 | publisher = Shogakukan | location = Tokyo | language = ja | trans-title = Kozukata | oclc = 56431036 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ | archive-date = 2007-08-25 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Its name was changed from {{Nihongo2|森岡}} to {{Nihongo2|盛岡}} (both read as "Morioka")<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bunka.pref.iwate.jp/seikatsu/chimei/data/shimei.html |title=【地名の由来】市名 |access-date=2013-09-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316201021/http://www.bunka.pref.iwate.jp/seikatsu/chimei/data/shimei.html |archive-date=2014-03-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> During the [[Boshin War]] of the [[Meiji Restoration]], Morioka Domain was a key member of the pro-Tokugawa ''[[Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei]].''

After the start of the [[Meiji period]], the former Morioka Domain became Morioka Prefecture in 1870, and part of Iwate Prefecture from 1872. With the establishment of the modern municipality system on April 1, 1889, the city of Morioka was established as the capital of Iwate Prefecture. The city was connected by train to [[Tokyo]] in 1890. The city emerged from [[World War II]] with very little damage, having been subject to only two minor [[Air raids on Japan|air raids]] during the war.<ref>[http://www.soumu.go.jp/main_sosiki/daijinkanbou/sensai/situation/state/tohoku_02.html Ministry of Home Affairs of Japan] {{in lang|ja}}</ref>

On January 10, 2006, the village of [[Tamayama, Iwate|Tamayama]] was merged into Morioka. Morioka was proclaimed a [[Core cities of Japan|core city]] in 2008, with increased local autonomy.

During the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|2011 Tōhoku earthquake]], Morioka was hit by a 6.1 earthquake, and numerous aftershocks, but with little damage other than extensive power outages.<ref>http://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-61-magnitude-quake-hits-near-morioka-japan-2011-03-11 - retrieved March 14, 2011</ref>

[[File:Sansa Odori 3.JPG|thumb|Sansa Odori festival]]
*[[Hōon-ji (Morioka)|Hōon-ji]] is a [[Sōtō|Sōtō Zen]] Buddhist temple which was originally built at Sannohe by the 13th lord of the Nambu clan, Nambu Moriyuki, in 1394, and brought to Morioka by the 27th lord, Nambu Toshinao. It was considered the head temple among the 280 operated by the Nambu clan. A notable feature is the Rakan-dō, built in 1735 and rebuilt in 1858. Its central statue [[Vairocana|''Rushana butsu'']] is reported to be made by [[Kūkai|Kōbō-daishi]]. Within the Rakan-dō are statues of the 500 ''[[Arhat|Rakan]]'',  which were made in [[Kyoto]] and later brought to Morioka. Included are representations of [[Kublai Khan]] and [[Marco Polo]]. It is an active Zen training temple for monks.
* Mitsuishi Jinja is a [[Shinto shrine]] which has three large rocks on the grounds with shackles around them to represent the story of 'Oni no tegata', which is a legend explaining the origin of the name of Iwate prefecture. According to the legend, there was once an ''Oni'' or demon who often tormented and harassed the local people. When the people prayed to the spirit of Mitsuishi for protection, the demon was immediately shackled to the rocks and made to promise never to trouble the people again. As a sign of this promise, the demon left a handprint on one of the rocks, thus giving rise to the name Iwate, literally meaning "rock hand".
*[[Morioka Hachiman Shrine]]
* Sakurayama is a [[Shinto shrine]] 20 feet above (6 meters) featuring a massive rock.{{clarify|reason="above" what|date=May 2018}}
