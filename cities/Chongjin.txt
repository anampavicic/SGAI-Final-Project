==History==

===Prehistory===
According to archaeological findings near the lower areas of the [[Tumen River|Tumen river]], evidence of human living traces back to the [[Paleolithic|paleolithic period]].<ref name="chong"/>

===Ancient and medieval history===
According to the [[Records of the Grand Historian]], the region was where the tribe kingdoms of [[Buyeo]], [[Mohe people|Mohe]], [[Okjeo]], [[Yilou]], [[Yemaek]] and [[Sushen]] existed. The region later was the territory of [[Goguryeo]]. After the fall of Goguryeo in 668, the region was ruled by the [[Tang dynasty]]. During the reign of [[Balhae]], the region was under the subdivision Donggyeongyongwonbu. The region was under the rule of the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] and [[Yuan dynasty]] after the fall of [[Balhae]] by the [[Liao dynasty|Khitans]].<ref name="chong">{{cite web|url=http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Item/E0056774|title=청진시}}</ref>

===Modern history===
[[File:Emblem of Cheongjin-bu.svg|thumb|Emblem of Seishinfu(chongjin bu), administrative division Chongjin fell under Japanese rule]]
Chongjin was a small fishing village prior to the [[Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910|Japanese annexation of Korea]]; its date of establishment is unknown. The Chinese characters for its name mean 'clear river crossing'.<ref name="nk"/> During the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904–1905, Japanese forces landed at Chongjin and established a supply base due to its proximity to the front lines in [[Manchuria]]. The Japanese remained after the end of the war, and in 1908, declared the city an open trading port both for the transport of Korean resources and as a stopping point for resources from China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.communitywalk.com/location_info/363120/356350|title=Woolverton Inn - Ceremony - North Korea's Geography & Major cities - A Map viewing major cities and the capital of North Korea.

The [[Imperial Japanese Army]]’s [[19th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|19th Division]] was headquartered in [[Ranam-guyok|Ranam]] from 1918, where the Japanese built a new [[planned city]] based on a rectangular street grid.<ref name="nk"/> In 1930, [[Nippon Steel]] built a large [[steel mill]], the Seishin Iron and Steel Works, in the town. Ranam was annexed to Chongjin in 1940, which was elevated to city status. The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] [[Seishin Operation|overran]] the city after brief resistance on 13 August 1945, only two days before the end of [[World War II]]. Under the rule of North Korea, Chongjin remained an important military and industrial centre. It was directly administered by the central government from 1960–1967 and from 1977–1988.{{cn|date=October 2024}}

On April 15, 1969 at 13:30 [[24-hour clock|MT]] (1:30 PM), a [[Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed EC-121M Super Constellation]] of the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] (135749) was [[1969 EC-121 shootdown incident|shot down]] by two [[Korean People's Army Air and Anti-Air Force|North Korean]] [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17]] fighters SE of Chongjin over the [[Sea of Japan]]. All 31 occupants were killed, making it the deadliest plane crash in North Korean territory. The plane was on a military flight out of [[Naval Air Facility Atsugi|Atsugi NAS]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=ASN Aircraft accident Lockheed EC-121M Super Constellation 135749 Chongjin |url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19690415-0 |access-date=2023-08-31 |website=aviation-safety.net}}</ref>

During the [[North Korean famine]] of the 1990s, Chongjin was one of the worst affected locations in the country; death rates may have been as high as 20%.<ref name="nk"/> Conditions there remain poor in terms of food availability.<ref name="nk"/> This problem has caused several instances of civil unrest in Chongjin, a rarity in North Korea. On 4 March 2008, a crowd of women merchants protested in response to tightened market controls.<ref name="nk"/> Rising grain prices and government attempts to prohibit "peddling in the market" have been cited as causes for the protests.<ref name="nk"/> As a result of the protest, the Chongjin local government "posted a proclamation allowing peddling in the market."<ref name="Good Friends 2008">Good Friends, “North Korea Today,” No. 113 (Mar. 14, 2008)</ref> On 24 August 2008, a clash occurred between foot patrol agents and female merchants, which escalated into a "massive protest rally". It was reported that the Chongjin local government-issued verbal instructions relaxing the enforcement activity until the time of the next grain ration.<ref name="Good Friends 2008"/>

== Administrative divisions ==
From 1948 to 1960, 1967 to 1977, and 1987 to present, Ch'ŏngjin was governed as a part of [[North Hamgyong Province]]. From 1960 until 1967, and again from 1977 to 1987, Chongjin was administered as a [[Special cities of North Korea|directly governed city]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nk.chosun.com/map/map.html?ACT=geo_03 |script-title=ko:행정구역 개편 일지|date=2006-04-05|work=[[The Chosun Ilbo]]|language=ko|access-date=2006-11-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102025933/http://nk.chosun.com/map/map.html?ACT=geo_03 |archive-date=2006-11-02 }}</ref>

Ch'ŏngjin is divided into seven wards (구역, ''kuyŏk'', {{IPA|ko|kujʌk}}).

== Geography ==
Chongjin is located in the northeast of North Korea, in North Hamgyong Province, near the [[East Korea Bay]] (Kyŏngsŏng Bay)<ref name="bay name and other">{{cite web|title=Chongjin|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/114333/Chongjin|publisher=Encyclopaeida Britannica|access-date=8 December 2012}}</ref> in the [[Sea of Japan]]. The Susong River (수성천) runs through the city; contained in the city are the Sodu Stream (서두수) and Mount Komal (고말산).

=== Climate ===
Chongjin has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Dwa'', bordering on ''Dwb'') with cold, dry winters and warm, rainy summers.

Chongjin is one of the DPRK's important steel and fiber industry centers. It has a [[shipyard]], a [[locomotive]] plant, and a [[rubber]] factory. Near the port area are the [[Chongjin Steel Co]]., [[Chemical Textile Co]]., May 10 Coal Mine Machinery Factory, and [[Kimchaek Iron & Steel]] (which was called [[Nippon Steel]] during the Japanese occupation);<ref name="nk"/> however industrial activities in the city have been severely handicapped due to a lack of resources. Despite this, however, Chongjin is estimated to have a 24 percent share of the DPRK's foreign trade and is home to a resident Chinese consul who serves Chinese merchants and businesspersons operating in the northeast of the country.<ref name="Smith, Hazel 2009">Smith, Hazel (2009).''North Korean Shipping: A Potential for WMD Proliferation?'', Asia Pacific Issues. No. 87.

Because of the heavy concentration of industries in the area, Chongjin is also the DPRK's air pollution black spot.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent shortage of oil to generate electricity, many factories have been shuttered. One of the first senior U.N. officials permitted to visit the area, [[Tun Myat]], observed in 1997 when the North Korea economic crisis reached its peak, "Chongjin was like a forest of scrap metal, with huge plants that seem to go on for miles and miles that have been turned into rust buckets. I've been all over the world, and I've never seen anything quite like this."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Deprivation Spurs Change in N.
