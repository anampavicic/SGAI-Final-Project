The [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word for Wisconsin and its original meaning have both grown obscure. While interpretations vary, most implicate the river and the red sandstone that lines its banks. One leading theory holds that the name originated from the [[Miami-Illinois language|Miami]] word {{lang|mia|Meskonsing}}, meaning {{gloss|it lies red}}, a reference to the setting of the Wisconsin River as it flows through the reddish sandstone of the [[Dells of the Wisconsin River|Wisconsin Dells]].<ref>McCafferty, Michael. 2003.

Even so, French traders continued to work in the region after the war, and some, beginning with [[Charles de Langlade]] in 1764, settled in Wisconsin permanently, rather than returning to British-controlled Canada.<ref name="Wisconsin Historical Society">{{cite web|title=Dictionary of Wisconsin History: Langlade, Charles Michel|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=2266&search_term=Langlade%2C+Charles+Michel|publisher=[[Wisconsin Historical Society]]|access-date=March 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204150014/http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=2266&search_term=Langlade%2C+Charles+Michel|archive-date=December 4, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

The British gradually took over Wisconsin during the French and Indian War, taking control of Green Bay in 1761 and gaining control of all of Wisconsin in 1763. Like the French, the British were interested in little but the fur trade. One notable event in the fur trading industry in Wisconsin occurred in 1791, when two free African Americans set up a fur trading post among the Menominee at present-day [[Marinette, Wisconsin|Marinette]]. The first permanent settlers, mostly [[French Canadian]]s, some Anglo-[[New England]]ers and a few African American freedmen, arrived in Wisconsin while it was under British control. Charles de Langlade is generally recognized as the first settler, establishing a trading post at Green Bay in 1745, and moving there permanently in 1764.<ref name="Wisconsin Historical Society"/> Settlement began at Prairie du Chien around 1781. The French residents at the trading post in what is now Green Bay, referred to the town as "La Baye". However, British fur traders referred to it as "Green Bay", because the water and the shore assumed green tints in early spring. The old French title was gradually dropped, and the British name of "Green Bay" eventually stuck. The region coming under British rule had virtually no adverse effect on the French residents as the British needed the cooperation of the French fur traders and the French fur traders needed the goodwill of the British. During the French occupation of the region licenses for fur trading had been issued scarcely and only to select groups of traders, whereas the British, in an effort to make as much money as possible from the region, issued licenses for fur trading freely, both to British and to French residents. The fur trade in what is now Wisconsin reached its height under British rule, and the first self-sustaining farms in the state were established as well. From 1763 to 1780, Green Bay was a prosperous community which produced its own foodstuff, built graceful cottages and held dances and festivities.<ref>Wisconsin, a Guide to the Badger State page 188</ref>

Wisconsin became a territorial possession of the United States in 1783 after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. In 1787, it became part of the [[Northwest Territory]]. As territorial boundaries subsequently developed, it was then part of [[Indiana Territory]] from 1800 to 1809, [[Illinois Territory]] from 1809 to 1818, and [[Michigan Territory]] from 1818 to 1836. However, the British remained in control until after the [[War of 1812]], the outcome of which finally established an American presence in the area.<ref>{{cite book|title=Wisconsin: A History|last=Nesbit|first=Robert|year=1973|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, WI|isbn=978-0-299-06370-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/wisconsinhistory0000nesb/page/62 62–64]|url=https://archive.org/details/wisconsinhistory0000nesb/page/62}}</ref> Under American control, the economy of the territory shifted from fur trading to lead mining. The prospect of easy mineral wealth drew immigrants from throughout the U.S. and Europe to the lead deposits located at [[Mineral Point, Wisconsin|Mineral Point]], [[Dodgeville, Wisconsin|Dodgeville]], and nearby areas. Some miners found shelter in the holes they had dug, and earned the nickname "badgers", leading to Wisconsin's identity as the "Badger State".<ref>{{cite web|title=Badger Nickname|url=http://www.uwbadgers.com/trads/nickname.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323002815/http://www.uwbadgers.com/trads/nickname.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 23, 2011|publisher=University of Wisconsin|access-date=March 14, 2010}}</ref> The sudden influx of white miners prompted tension with the local Native American population.

Following these conflicts, [[Wisconsin Territory]] was created by an act of the [[United States Congress]] on April 20, 1836. By fall of that year, the best prairie groves of the counties surrounding what is now Milwaukee were occupied by farmers from the [[New England]] states.<ref>Wisconsin, a Guide to the Badger State page 197</ref>

The [[Erie Canal]] facilitated the travel of both [[Yankee]] settlers and European immigrants to Wisconsin Territory.

The growing population allowed Wisconsin to gain statehood on May 29, 1848, as the 30th state. Between 1840 and 1850, Wisconsin's non-Indian population had swollen from 31,000 to 305,000. More than a third of residents (110,500) were foreign born, including 38,000 Germans, 28,000 British immigrants from England, Scotland, and Wales, and 21,000 Irish. Another third (103,000) were Yankees from New England and western New York state. Only about 63,000 residents in 1850 had been born in Wisconsin.<ref>Robert C. Nesbit.

Politics in early Wisconsin were defined by the greater national debate over slavery. A free state from its foundation, Wisconsin became a center of northern [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]]. The debate became especially intense in 1854 after [[Joshua Glover]], a runaway slave from [[Missouri]], was captured in [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]]. Glover was taken into custody under the Federal [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Law]], but a mob of abolitionists stormed the prison where Glover was held and helped him escape to Canada.

===Economic progress===
[[File:Chase Stone Barn - Green Grass.jpg|thumb|The [[Daniel E. Krause Stone Barn]] in [[Chase, Wisconsin|Chase]] was built in 1903, as dairy farming spread across the state.]]

Wisconsin's economy also diversified during the early years of statehood. While lead mining diminished, agriculture became a principal occupation in the southern half of the state. Railroads were built across the state to help transport grains to market, and industries like [[Case Corporation|J.I. Case & Company]] in Racine were founded to build agricultural equipment. Wisconsin briefly became one of the nation's leading producers of wheat during the 1860s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nesbit|year=1973|isbn=978-0-299-06370-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/wisconsinhistory0000nesb/page/273 273]|title=Wisconsin: a history|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |url=https://archive.org/details/wisconsinhistory0000nesb/page/273}}</ref> Meanwhile, the lumber industry dominated in the heavily forested northern sections of Wisconsin, and sawmills sprang up in cities like [[La Crosse]], [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin|Eau Claire]], and [[Wausau, Wisconsin|Wausau]]. These economic activities had dire environmental consequences. By the close of the 19th century, intensive agriculture had devastated soil fertility, and lumbering had deforested most of the state.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nesbit|year=1973|isbn=978-0-299-06370-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/wisconsinhistory0000nesb/page/281 281, 309]|title=Wisconsin: a history|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |url=https://archive.org/details/wisconsinhistory0000nesb/page/281}}</ref> These conditions forced both wheat agriculture and the lumber industry into a precipitous decline.

Beginning in the 1890s, farmers in Wisconsin shifted from wheat to dairy production to make more sustainable and profitable use of their land. Many immigrants carried cheese-making traditions that, combined with the state's suitable geography and dairy research led by [[Stephen Babcock]] at the [[University of Wisconsin]], helped the state build a reputation as "America's Dairyland".<ref>{{cite book|title= The Progressive Era, 1893–1914|series=History of Wisconsin|volume=4|first=John|last=Buenker|publisher=State Historical Society of Wisconsin|location=Madison, WI|year=1998|editor-first=William Fletcher|editor-last=Thompson|isbn=978-0-87020-303-9|pages=25, 40–41, 62}}</ref> Meanwhile, conservationists including [[Aldo Leopold]] helped re-establish the state's forests during the early 20th century,<ref>{{cite web|title=Turning Points in Wisconsin History: The Modern Environmental Movement|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-048/?action=more_essay|publisher=[[Wisconsin Historical Society]]|access-date=March 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204150526/http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-048/?action=more_essay|archive-date=December 4, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> paving the way for a more renewable lumber and [[paper mill]]ing industry as well as promoting recreational tourism in the northern woodlands. Manufacturing also boomed in Wisconsin during the early 20th century, driven by an immense immigrant workforce arriving from Europe.

In the immediate aftermath of [[World War II]], citizens of Wisconsin were divided over issues such as creation of the [[United Nations]], support for the European recovery, and the growth of the [[Soviet Union]]'s power. However, when Europe divided into Communist and capitalist camps and the [[Chinese Communist Revolution]] succeeded in 1949, public opinion began to move towards support for the protection of democracy and capitalism against Communist expansion.<ref>A Short History of Wisconsin By Erika Janik page 149</ref>

Wisconsin took part in several political extremes in the mid to late 20th century, ranging from the [[McCarthyism|anti-communist]] crusades of Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] in the 1950s to the radical antiwar protests at UW-Madison that culminated in the [[Sterling Hall bombing]] in August 1970. The state undertook [[welfare reform]] under Republican Governor [[Tommy Thompson]] during the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tommy Thompson: Human Services Reformer|website = [[ABC News (United States)|ABC News]]|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=122179&page=1|date=September 4, 2004|access-date=March 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130132917/https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=122179&page=1|archive-date=January 30, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> The state's economy also underwent further transformations towards the close of the 20th century, as heavy industry and manufacturing declined in favor of a [[service economy]] based on medicine, education, agribusiness, and tourism.

In 2011, Wisconsin became the focus of some controversy when newly elected governor [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] proposed and then successfully passed and enacted [[2011 Wisconsin Act 10]], which made large changes in the areas of collective bargaining, compensation, retirement, health insurance, and sick leave of public sector employees, among other changes.<ref>{{cite news|last=Condon|first=Stephanie|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-signs-anti-union-bill-but-democrats-say-theyre-the-political-victors/|title=Wisconsin Gov.

Wisconsin is located in the [[Midwestern United States]] and is part of both the [[Great Lakes region]] and [[Upper Midwest]]. The state has a total area of {{Convert|65,496|sqmi|km2}}. Wisconsin is bordered by the [[Montreal River (Wisconsin–Michigan)|Montreal River]]; [[Lake Superior]] and [[Michigan]] to the north; by [[Lake Michigan]] to the east; by [[Illinois]] to the south; and by [[Iowa]] to the southwest and [[Minnesota]] to the northwest. A border dispute with Michigan was settled by two cases, both [[Wisconsin v. Michigan]], in 1934 and 1935. The state's boundaries include the [[Mississippi River]] and [[St. Croix River (Wisconsin–Minnesota)|St. Croix River]] in the west, and the [[Menominee River]] in the northeast.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/subjects/rivers/wisconsin.htm |website=National Park Service |access-date=21 June 2024 |title=Wisconsin - Rivers (U.S. National Park Service) }}</ref>

With its location between the [[Great Lakes]] and the Mississippi River, Wisconsin is home to a wide variety of geographical features. The state is divided into five distinct regions. In the north, the [[Lake Superior Lowland]] occupies a belt of land along Lake Superior. Just to the south, the [[Northern Highland]] has massive mixed hardwood and coniferous forests including the {{convert|1500000|acre|adj=on|abbr=off}} [[Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest]], as well as thousands of glacial lakes, and the state's highest point, [[Timms Hill]]. In the middle of the state, the [[Central Plain (Wisconsin)|Central Plain]] has some unique [[sandstone]] formations like the [[Dells of the Wisconsin River]] in addition to rich farmland. The [[Eastern Ridges and Lowlands]] region in the southeast is home to many of Wisconsin's largest cities.

Most of Wisconsin is classified as warm-summer [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb''), while southern and southwestern portions are classified as hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen ''Dfa''). The highest temperature ever recorded in the state was in the Wisconsin Dells, on July 13, 1936, where it reached 114&nbsp;°F (46&nbsp;°C). The lowest temperature ever recorded in Wisconsin was in the village of [[Couderay]], where it reached −55&nbsp;°F (−48&nbsp;°C) on both February 2 and 4, 1996. Wisconsin also receives a large amount of regular snowfall averaging around {{convert|40|in|cm}} in the southern portions with up to {{convert|160|in|cm}} annually in the Lake Superior [[snowbelt]] each year.<ref name="uwexclimate">{{cite web|url=http://www.uwex.edu/sco/stateclimate.html|title=Climate of Wisconsin|access-date=March 16, 2007|last=Benedetti|first=Michael|publisher=The University of Wisconsin–Extension|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117094615/http://www.uwex.edu/sco/stateclimate.html|archive-date=January 17, 2013}}</ref>

Since its founding, Wisconsin has been ethnically heterogeneous. Following the period of French fur traders, the next wave of settlers were miners, many of whom were [[Cornish American|Cornish]], who settled the southwestern area of the state. The next wave was dominated by "Yankees", migrants of [[English American|English descent]] from [[New England]] and [[upstate New York]]; in the early years of statehood, they dominated the state's heavy industry, finance, politics, and education. Between 1850 and 1900, the immigrants were mostly [[German Americans|Germans]], [[Scandinavian Americans|Scandinavians]] (the largest group being [[Norwegian American|Norwegian]]), [[Irish Americans|Irish]], and [[Polish Americans|Poles]]. In the 20th century, a number of African Americans and [[Mexican Americans|Mexicans]] settled in [[Milwaukee]]; and after the end of the [[Vietnam War]] came an influx of [[Hmong Americans|Hmongs]].

The various ethnic groups settled in different areas of the state. Although German immigrants settled throughout the state, the largest concentration was in Milwaukee. Norwegian immigrants settled in lumbering and farming areas in the north and west. Irish, Italian, and Polish immigrants settled primarily in urban areas.<ref>Miller, Frank H., [http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/tp&CISOPTR=14489 "The Polanders in Wisconsin"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829135614/http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=%2Ftp&CISOPTR=14489 |date=August 29, 2009 }}, Parkman Club Publications No. 10.

The [[Door Peninsula]], which extends off the eastern coast of the state, contains [[Door County, Wisconsin|Door County]], a popular destination for boaters due to the large number of natural harbors and boat launches on both the Green Bay and Lake Michigan sides of the peninsula. The area draws more than two million visitors yearly to its quaint villages, seasonal cherry picking, and [[fish boil]]s.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141029161327/http://map.co.door.wi.us/planning/Comp-Plan/Completed/Town%20of%20Sevasopol%20Comprehensive%20Plan.pdf Town of Sevastopol Comprehensive Plan 2028], November 2008, Chapter 4, page 11, (page 64 of the pdf) (Archived October 29, 2014)</ref><ref>William H.

Given the large number of lakes and rivers in the state, water recreation is popular. In the Northwoods Lake Country, what had been an industrial area focused on timber has largely been transformed into a vacation destination. Popular interest in the environment and environmentalism, added to traditional interests in hunting and fishing, has attracted a large urban audience within driving range.<ref>Aaron Shapiro, ''The Lure of the North Woods: Cultivating Tourism in the Upper Midwest'' (University of Minnesota Press, 2015).</ref> [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin|Lake Geneva]] in southeastern Wisconsin is similarly popular for water recreation.

===Taxation===
{{main|Sales taxes in the United States|Property tax in the United States|State income tax}}
[[File:Wisconsin Budget (2021).webp|thumb|upright=1.25|Wisconsin Budget (2021)]]

Wisconsin collects personal [[income tax]]es which range from 4% to 7.65% based on five [[income bracket]]s. The state [[sales tax|sales]] and [[use tax]] rate is 5.0%. Fifty-nine counties have an additional sales/use tax of 0.5%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revenue.wi.gov/esd/cotax07.html|title=County Sales Tax Distribution-2007|access-date=March 24, 2007|date=March 6, 2007|publisher=Wisconsin Department of Revenue|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513134039/http://www.revenue.wi.gov/esd/cotax07.html|archive-date=May 13, 2008}}</ref>

The most common property tax assessed on Wisconsin residents is the real [[property tax]], or their residential property tax. Wisconsin does not impose a property tax on vehicles, but does levy an annual registration fee. Property taxes are the most important tax revenue source for Wisconsin's local governments, as well as major methods of funding school districts, vocational-technical colleges, special purpose districts and tax incremental finance districts. Equalized values are based on the full market value of all taxable property in the state, except for agricultural land. To provide property tax relief for farmers, the value of agricultural land is determined by its value for agricultural uses, rather than for its possible development value. Equalized values are used to distribute state aid payments to counties, municipalities, and technical colleges. Assessments prepared by local assessors are used to distribute the property tax burden within individual municipalities.

Wisconsin does not assess a tax on [[intangible property]]. Wisconsin does not collect [[inheritance tax]]es. Until January 1, 2008, Wisconsin's [[estate tax]] was decoupled from the federal estate tax laws; therefore the state imposed its own estate tax on certain large estates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revenue.wi.gov/faqs/ise/estate.html#ret3|title=Wisconsin Department of Revenue|publisher=Revenue.wi.gov|access-date=July 25, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722063948/http://www.revenue.wi.gov/faqs/ise/estate.html#ret3|archive-date=July 22, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

There are no [[toll road]]s in Wisconsin; highway construction and maintenance are funded in part by [[motor fuel tax]] revenues, and the remaining balance is drawn from the State General Fund. Non-highway road construction and maintenance are funded by local governments (municipalities or counties).

===Alcohol===
[[File:Miller Brewery.png|thumb|The [[Miller Brewing Company|Miller Brewery]] in Milwaukee]]

Drinking has long been considered a significant part of Wisconsin culture, and the state ranks at or near the top of national measures of per-capita alcohol consumption, consumption of alcohol per state, and proportion of drinkers. Consumption per-capita per-event, however, ranks low among the nation; number of events (number of times alcohol is involved) is significantly higher or highest, but consumption at each event smaller, marking Wisconsin's consumption as frequent and moderate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/31237904.html|author=Rick Romell|title=Drinking deeply ingrained in Wisconsin's culture|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=October 19, 2008|access-date=August 18, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114133501/http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/31237904.html|archive-date=January 14, 2012}}</ref> Factors such as cultural identification with the state's heritage of German immigration, the long-standing presence of major breweries in Milwaukee, and a cold climate are often associated with the prevalence of drinking in Wisconsin.

Many large breweries were founded in Wisconsin, largely in Milwaukee, which gained the epithet "Brew City" before the turn of the century. [[Miller Brewing Company]], [[Pabst Brewing Company]], [[Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company]], and [[Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company]] all began as local businesses before entering national markets. Several other popular craft brews include Ale Asylum,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ale Asylum|url=http://www.aleasylum.com/|access-date=March 23, 2021|website=www.aleasylum.com}}</ref> [[Capital Brewery|Capital]], [[Sprecher Brewery|Sprecher]], and [[New Glarus Brewing Company|New Glarus]], the latter being well known for the Spotted Cow Farmhouse Ale only sold in Wisconsin.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rotman |first1=Audrey |title=Explained: Why New Glarus beer is only sold in Wisconsin |url=https://608today.6amcity.com/new-glarus-beer-only-sold-wisconsin |website=608 Today |date=November 12, 2021 |access-date=May 23, 2024}}</ref>

In Wisconsin, the legal drinking age is 21, except when accompanied by a parent, guardian, or spouse who is at least 21 years old. Age requirements are waived for possessing alcohol when employed by a brewer, brewpub, wholesaler, or producer of alcohol fuel.

During the [[American Civil War]], Wisconsin was a [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] state; in fact, it is the state that gave birth to the Republican Party, although ethno-religious issues in the late 19th century caused a brief split in the coalition. The [[Bennett Law]] campaign of 1890 dealt with foreign language teaching in schools. Many Germans switched to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] because of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party's]] support of the law.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kellogg|first1=Louise Phelps|title=The Bennett Law in Wisconsin|journal=Wisconsin Magazine of History|date=September 1918|volume=2|issue=1|pages=3–25|jstor=4630124}}</ref>

Wisconsin's political history encompasses, on the one hand, [[Robert La Follette]] and the [[Progressive movement]], and on the other, the Republican and anti-Communist [[Joe McCarthy]]. From the early 20th century, the [[Socialist Party of America]] had a base in Milwaukee. The phenomenon was referred to as "[[sewer socialism]]" because the elected officials were more concerned with public works and reform than with revolution (although revolutionary socialism existed in the city as well). Its influence faded in the late 1950s largely because of the [[Second Red Scare|red scare]] and racial tensions.<ref name="smith2003">{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kevin D.|date=Spring 2003|title=From Socialism to Racism: The Politics of Class and Identity in Postwar Milwaukee|journal=Michigan Historical Review|volume=29|issue=1|pages=71–95|doi=10.2307/20174004|jstor=20174004}}</ref> The first socialist mayor of a large city in the United States was [[Emil Seidel]], elected mayor of Milwaukee in 1910; another socialist, [[Daniel Hoan]], was mayor of Milwaukee from 1916 to 1940; and a third, [[Frank P.

Socialist [[newspaper editor]] [[Victor Berger]] was repeatedly elected as a U.S. Representative.

Through the first half of the 20th century, Wisconsin's politics were dominated by Robert La Follette and his sons, originally of the Republican Party, but later of the revived [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive Party]]. Since 1945, the state has maintained a close balance between Republicans and [[Democratic Party of Wisconsin|Democrats]]. Recent leading Republicans include former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Paul Ryan]], Governor [[Tommy Thompson]] and Congressman [[Jim Sensenbrenner]]; prominent Democrats include Senators [[Herb Kohl]] and [[Russ Feingold]], the only [[United States Senate|Senator]] to vote against the [[Patriot Act]] in 2001, and Congressman [[David Obey]].<ref name="conant2006">{{cite book|last=Conant|first=James K.|title=Wisconsin Politics and Government: America's Laboratory of Democracy|date=March 1, 2006|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|isbn=978-0-8032-1548-1|chapter=1}}</ref>

[[File:What are you looking at? (48480462057).jpg|thumb|The [[American badger]] is the [[List of U.S. state mammals|state animal]] of Wisconsin.]]

Wisconsin is traditionally known as the "Badger State" due to its early history in [[lead]] [[mining]]. Many of the state's first settlers were drawn by the prospect of mining in southwest Wisconsin, a mineral-rich region which had been contested between [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and the U.S. Some of the miners lived burrowed within hillsides either due to lack of time or finances to build above-ground structures during the winter. Similar to the [[American badger]] using its claws to dig holes, the miners were nicknamed "badgers". The [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] adopted the badger as a mascot in 1889 after the nickname; the badger was named Wisconsin's state animal in 1957.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jsonline.com/story/life/green-sheet/2021/11/09/why-wisconsin-badger-state-and-do-actual-badgers-live-here/6095021001/ |title=Why is Wisconsin the Badger State — and do actual badgers live here? |author=Jurado, Alexa |publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |date=November 9, 2021 |access-date=July 16, 2024 }}</ref>
