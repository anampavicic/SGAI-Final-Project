==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2013|small=}}

===Origin===
Tsu originally developed as a port town known as {{nihongo|Anotsu|安濃津|}} in the [[Nara period|Nara]] and [[Heian period]]s.

The port was destroyed by a [[tsunami]] in the [[1498 Meiō Nankaidō earthquake]].

</gallery>

===Edo period===
The town was rebuilt as a [[jōkamachi|castle town]] and a [[shukuba|post station]] by the [[Tōdō clan]], ''[[daimyō]]'' of [[Tsu Domain]] under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. During the [[Edo period]], it became a popular stopping point for travelers to [[Ise Grand Shrine]], about 40&nbsp;km to the southeast.

===Modern Tsu===
Following the [[Meiji Restoration]], Tsu became the capital of Mie Prefecture in 1871. With the establishment of then modern municipalities on April 1, 1889, Tsu was one of the original 31 cities to be proclaimed. The city borders gradually expanded, with Tsu annexing the neighboring villages of Tatebe and Tosa in 1909, Shinmachi in 1934, Fujimi in 1936, Takachaya in 1939 and Anto, Kanbe and Kushigata in 1943. During [[World War II]], Allied air raids on July 24 and July 28, 1945, destroyed most of the city and killed 1,239 people. In 1953, Tsu annexed the neighboring villages of Kumozu in 1953, Isshinden, Shiratsuka, Kurima, and Katada in 1954 and Toyosato in 1973.

As a result of the merger, the city became the second largest in Mie by population behind [[Yokkaichi, Mie|Yokkaichi]], and the largest in Mie by area ahead of [[Matsusaka, Mie|Matsusaka]].

==Government==
Tsu has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 34 members. Tsu contributes seven members to the Mie Prefectural Assembly.
