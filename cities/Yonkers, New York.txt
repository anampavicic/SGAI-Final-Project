== Name ==
The area was granted to [[Adriaen van der Donck]], the [[patroon]] of [[Colen Donck|Colendonck]], in July 1645. Van der Donck was known locally as {{Lang|nl|[[Jonkheer]]}} ('young gentleman'), an [[Courtesy title|honorific title]] derived from the Dutch {{Lang|nl|jonk}} ('young') and ''{{Lang|nl|heer}}'' ('lord'). The title, similar to "[[esquire]]", is linguistically comparable to the German ''Junker''. ''{{Lang|nl|Jonkheer}}'' was shortened to ''{{Lang|nl|Jonker}}'' ([[possessive]] ''{{Lang|nl|Jonkers}}''), from which the name ''Yonkers'' derives.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thomson Faris |first1=John |title=Historic Shrines of America |year=1918 |publisher=George H.

=== {{anchor|Gentrification and redlining of neighborhoods}}Gentrification and redlining ===
Yonkers has undergone several changes to neighborhoods in an effort to revitalize the city, which has included [[gentrification]]. Changes were made to its waterfront, which included revitalizing its green space.<ref name=TRNR/>

Residents of the western area of downtown Yonkers opposed the Pierpointe, a condominium-complex development proposal that would build over 1,900 condominiums (including six 38-story towers), during the 1980s struggle against segregation. According to critics, the development would bring homelessness and gentrification to the area.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Brown |first1=Betsy |title=Neighbors Fight Pierpointe Project In Yonkers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/07/nyregion/neighbors-fight-pierpointe-project-in-yonkers.html |access-date=29 December 2023 |work=The New York Times |date=February 7, 1988 |url-access=registration |archive-date=December 29, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231229044538/https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/07/nyregion/neighbors-fight-pierpointe-project-in-yonkers.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Village of Yonkers was incorporated in the western Town of Yonkers in 1854, and incorporated as a city in 1872. In 1873, the southern Town of Yonkers (outside the City of Yonkers) became the Town of Kingsbridge; this included [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] and the present-day neighborhoods of [[Kingsbridge, Bronx|Kingsbridge]], [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]], and [[Woodlawn Heights, Bronx|Woodlawn Heights]]. The Town of Kingsbridge was annexed by New York City the following year as part of the Bronx. In 1898, Yonkers, [[Brooklyn]], [[Queens]], and [[Staten Island]] voted on a referendum to determine if they wanted to become part of New York City. Although the referendum passed elsewhere, Yonkers and neighboring [[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon]] were not included in the consolidated city and remained independent.<ref>{{cite inside}}, p.177-78</ref> Some residents call Yonkers "the [[sixth borough]]" because of its location on the New York City border, its urban character, and the merger referendum.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Malone |first1=Michael |date=April 14, 2021 |title=Is Westchester County New York City's Sixth Borough? |url=https://westchestermagazine.com/life-style/nyc-sixth-borough/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230915012136/https://westchestermagazine.com/life-style/nyc-sixth-borough/ |archive-date=September 15, 2023 |access-date=13 September 2023 |website=Westchester Magazine}}</ref>

=== Racial discrimination and ''United States v. Yonkers'' ===
In 1960, the population of Yonkers was 95.8 percent white and four percent Black.<ref name="census1" /> The city developed a national reputation for racial tension during the 1980s and 1990s, based on a long-term battle between the city and the [[NAACP]] over the construction of subsidized, low-income [[housing projects]]. Yonkers planned to use federal funding for [[urban renewal]] exclusively downtown; other groups, led by the NAACP, believed that the resulting concentration of low-income housing in traditionally-poor neighborhoods would perpetuate poverty. Although the city had been warned in 1971 by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] about further construction of low-income housing in west Yonkers, it continued to support subsidized housing in this area between 1972 and 1977.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Esannson |first1=Harold |title=A Study of African-American Life in Yonkers From the Turn of the Century |last2=Bagwell |first2=Vinnie |publisher=Harold Esannson |year=1993 |pages=50}}</ref>

As a result of the federal lawsuit, Yonkers' public-school enrollment dropped from 54 percent of the city's eligible population to under 30 percent as thousands of white families [[White flight|left the city for its suburbs]] or enrolled their children in private schools; this effectively gutted the city's middle class and tax base. The school district's estimated cost of integration was over $262 million. Forced to cut programs, Yonkers schools fell steeply in national rankings as test scores sharply declined. By 1995, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the city's desegregation effort "a profound disappointment to blacks and whites alike". Michael Sussmann, the NAACP's lawyer during the case, blamed Sand for failing to allocate federal funds to help relieve the cost of integration.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hernandez |first1=Raymond |title=Neither Separate Nor Equal;Yonkers Integrates Its Schools, to Little Effect |work=The New York Times |date=December 28, 1995 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/28/nyregion/neither-separate-nor-equal-yonkers-integrates-its-schools-to-little-effect.html |access-date=28 November 2023 |archive-date=April 23, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240423061611/https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/28/nyregion/neither-separate-nor-equal-yonkers-integrates-its-schools-to-little-effect.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Southwest Yonkers===
[[File:Getty Square, Yonkers, New York.jpg|thumb|alt=Busy downtown area with a narrow street|The center of Getty Square]]
[[Getty Square]] is Yonkers' [[downtown]] and its [[civic center]] and [[central business district]]. Much of southwest Yonkers grew along the railroad and trolley (now bus) lines along South Broadway and in Getty Square which run to New York City. Clusters of apartment buildings surrounded the stations of the Yonkers branch of the [[New York and Putnam Railroad]] and the [[Third Avenue Railway]] trolley lines; these buildings are now served by the [[Bee-Line Bus System]]. The railroad companies built neighborhoods of mixed housing which ranged from apartment buildings to large mansions in areas such as [[Park Hill, Yonkers|Park Hill]], where a [[funicular]] accessed the train station in the valley.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hughes |first1=C.

Southwest Yonkers, traditionally home to African American and white residents, has seen an influx of immigrants from Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, South Asia, and the Middle East. Many residents are of African, Caribbean, Italian, Polish, or Mexican descent.<ref name="Westchester Magazine January 2019"/> Some neighborhoods on the [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] border contain an increasing number of Orthodox Jews.<ref name="Riverdale Hatzalah"/>
