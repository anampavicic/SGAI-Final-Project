==History==
This area was a [[sisal]] and coffee-growing district with sisal on either side of the river to the right of the main road to [[Thika]]. It is now a housing area. There used to be four main manager houses on the estate on the south side of the river. The area was given over to an African consortium to be developed into smallholdings in the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ruiru|url=http://www.worldpoi.com/kenya/central/muranga/ruiru.html|website=WorldPOI|access-date=29 May 2020}}</ref>

Before Kenya's independence, Ruiru was administered under the [[Nairobi City Council]] and referred to as the Western Rural District.<ref name="kiambu.go.ke">https://kiambu.go.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ruiru-Municipality-Spatial-plan.pdf {{Dead link|date=June 2022}}</ref> After independence, the area was put under the administration of the Kiambu County Council before being elevated to a town council in 1986. In 1997, Ruiru was upgraded to municipality status comprising nine elective wards: Biashara, Gitothua, Gatongora, Kahawa Sukari, Githurai, Kimbo, Jacaranda, Theta, Viwanda, and Murera.<ref name="kiambu.go.ke"/>

The creation of the Nairobi Metropolitan Region (NMR) by an Executive Order in May 2008 put the town under its broader urban integrated plan.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.namsip.go.ke/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Metro2030_Strategy.pdf |title=Nairobi Metro 2030 |access-date=13 May 2022 |archive-date=25 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220625142637/https://namsip.go.ke/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Metro2030_Strategy.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Population==
In 2009, Ruiru's population was 238,858.<ref>{{cite web |access-date=5 March 2020 |url=http://kenya.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/profiles/Kiambu_Dec2011%2029.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223192732/http://kenya.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/profiles/Kiambu_Dec2011%2029.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 February 2013 |title=Kiambu County: Population of Major Urban Centers: Ruiru | publisher=[[United States Agency for International Development]]|date=2009 }}</ref> Ten years later, the 2019 national census found that the population was 490,120, making it the fourth-largest urban center in Kenya by population.<ref name="housingfinanceafrica.org"/>

The rapid population growth is attributable to several factors: the shortage of affordable residential housing in Nairobi; the infrastructure development, especially [[Thika Road]] and [[Nairobi Eastern Bypass Highway]], and the associated commercial and residential development that followed the new highways; and the presence of university campuses in or near Ruiru.<ref name="1R"/>{{Historical populations|1969|1,674|1979|1,718|1989|23,316|1999|79,741|2009|238,329|2019|490,120|align=none|footnote=source:<ref>[http://www.citypopulation.de/Kenya-Cities.html Ruiru population statistics]</ref>}}

==Education==
Two universities have their main campuses in Ruiru: Zetech [[Zetech University|University]] and [[Kiriri Women's University of Science and Technology]]. The [[Kenyatta University]] (Main and Ruiru Campuses) is also near the municipality. The [[University of Nairobi]] and other higher education institutions have campuses in or near Ruiru.<ref name="1R"/>
Danjose Academy, one of the leading academic primary institutions, is located in Ruiru. In July 2022, the President of Kenya, [[Uhuru Kenyatta]], broke ground in Ruiru for the [[Amref International University]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://newsroom.amref.org/press-releases/2022/07/amref-international-university-groundbreaking-ceremony/ | title=Amref International University Groundbreaking Ceremony | date=9 July 2022 }}</ref> The Health Science University will be hosted within the expansive Northlands City land in the municipality's southern wing.

==Politics== 
Ruiru was originally part of the greater [[Juja Constituency]] until it was hived off and made into an [[Ruiru Constituency|independent electoral area]]. It is separated from Juja by the Ruiru River as it flows downstream to the confluence with the [[Nairobi River]].

Esther Gathogo was a Member of Parliament from 2013 to 2017. Simon Ng'ang'a King'ara won the seat in the August 2017 general election.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Why Ruiru MP is popular among women, youths and street urchins|url=https://hivisasa.com/posts/why-ruiru-mp-is-popular-among-women-youths-and-street-urchins|website=Hivisasa|date=22 February 2018|author=Naomi Wanjiku|access-date=28 May 2020}}</ref>
