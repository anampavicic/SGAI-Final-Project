The city lies west of the foothills of the [[Atlas Mountains]].

The city was founded circa 1070 by [[Abu Bakr ibn Umar]] as the capital of the [[Almoravid dynasty]]. The Almoravids established the first major structures in the city and shaped its layout for centuries to come. The red [[Walls of Marrakesh|walls of the city]], built by [[Ali ibn Yusuf]] in 1122–1123, and various buildings constructed in red sandstone afterwards, have given the city the nickname of the "Red City" or "Ochre City". Marrakesh grew rapidly and established itself as a cultural, religious, and trading center for the [[Maghreb]]. After a period of decline, Marrakesh regained its status in the early 16th century as the capital of the [[Saadian dynasty]], with sultans [[Abdallah al-Ghalib]] and [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] embellishing the city with an array of sumptuous monuments. Beginning in the 17th century, the city became popular among [[sufism|Sufi]] pilgrims for its [[Seven Saints of Marrakesh|seven patron saints]] who are buried here. In 1912, the [[French protectorate in Morocco|French Protectorate in Morocco]] was established and [[T'hami El Glaoui]] became Pasha of Marrakesh and generally held this position until the independence of Morocco and the reestablishment of the monarchy in 1956.

Marrakesh comprises an old fortified city packed with vendors and their stalls. This [[medina quarter]] is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] and contains the [[Jemaa el-Fnaa]] square, a large number of [[souks]] (markets), the [[Kutubiyya Mosque]], and many other historic and cultural sites. The city serves as a major economic center and tourist destination. Real estate and hotel development in Marrakesh have grown dramatically in the 21st century. Marrakesh is particularly popular with the French, and numerous French celebrities own property in the city.

Marrakesh is served by [[Menara International Airport|Ménara International Airport]] and by [[Marrakesh railway station]], which connects the city to [[Casablanca]] and northern Morocco. Marrakesh has several universities and schools, including [[Cadi Ayyad University]]. A number of Moroccan football clubs are here, including [[Najm de Marrakech]], [[KAC Marrakech]], [[Mouloudia de Marrakech]] and [[Chez Ali Club de Marrakech]]. The [[Marrakesh Street Circuit]] hosts the [[World Touring Car Championship]], [[Auto GP]] and [[FIA Formula Two Championship (2009–2012)|FIA Formula Two Championship]] races.

==Etymology==
The exact meaning of the name is debated.{{sfn|Shillington|2005|p=948}} One possible origin of the name Marrakesh is from the [[Berber language|Berber]] (Amazigh) words ''amur (n) akush'', which means "Land of God".{{sfn|Nanjira|2010|p=208}} According to historian Susan Searight, however, the town's name was first documented in an 11th-century manuscript in the [[Qarawiyyin]] library in [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]], where its meaning was given as "country of the sons of Kush".{{sfn|Searight|1999|p=378}} The word ''mur'' {{sfn|Egginton|Pitz|2010|p=11}} is used now in Berber mostly in the feminine form ''tamurt''. The same word "mur" appears in [[Mauretania]], the North African kingdom from antiquity, although the link remains controversial as this name possibly originates from μαύρος ''mauros'', the [[ancient Greek]] word for "dark".{{sfn|Shillington|2005|p=948}} The common English spelling is "Marrakesh",{{sfn|de Cenival|1991|p=588}}{{sfn|Cornell|1998|p=15}} although "Marrakech" (the [[French language|French]] spelling) is also widely used.{{sfn|Nanjira|2010|p=208}} The name is spelled ''Mṛṛakc'' in the [[Berber Latin alphabet]], ''Marraquexe'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''Marrakech'' in Spanish.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=RAE|last2=RAE|title=Marrakech {{!}} Diccionario panhispánico de dudas|url=https://www.rae.es/dpd/Marrakech|access-date=2020-09-07|website=«Diccionario panhispánico de dudas»|language=es|archive-date=2021-11-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211107093401/https://www.rae.es/dpd/Marrakech|url-status=live}}</ref> A typical pronunciation in [[Moroccan Arabic]] is ''merrākesh'' ({{IPA|/mərra:kəʃ/}}) with [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] on the second syllable.<ref>{{Cite book |last= |first= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=16DfjwEACAAJ&q=georgetown+moroccan+arabic |title=The Georgetown Dictionary of Moroccan Arabic: Arabic-English, English-Arabic |publisher=Georgetown University Press |year=2018 |isbn=978-1-62616-331-7 |editor-last=Maamouri |editor-first=Mohamed |pages=584 (see xxv-xxvi for discussion of vowels) |language=en}}</ref>

From medieval times until around the beginning of the 20th century, the entire country of Morocco was known as the "Kingdom of Marrakesh", as the kingdom's [[History of Morocco|historic]] capital city was often Marrakesh.{{sfn|de Cenival|1991|p=593}}{{sfn|Gottreich|2007|p=10}} The name for Morocco is still "Marrakesh" to this day in [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu]] as well as many other South Asian languages. Various European names for Morocco (Marruecos, Marrocos, Maroc, Marokko, etc.) are directly derived from the name ''Murrākush''. Conversely, the city itself was in earlier times simply called ''Marocco City'' (or similar) by travelers from abroad. The name of the city and the country diverged after the [[Treaty of Fez]] divided Morocco into a [[French protectorate in Morocco]] and [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco]], and the old interchangeable usage lasted widely until about the interregnum of [[Mohammed Ben Aarafa]] (1953–1955).<ref name="IbpUSA2006">{{cite book |title=Morocco Country Study Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8GjrAeMS1dIC&pg=PA23|access-date=29 June 2013|date=1 April 2006|publisher=International Business Publications|isbn=978-0-7397-1514-7|page=23|archive-date=26 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626185538/http://books.google.com/books?id=8GjrAeMS1dIC&pg=PA23|url-status=live}}</ref> The latter episode set in motion the country's return to independence, when Morocco officially became {{lang|ar|المملكة المغربية}} (''al-Mamlaka al-Maġribiyya'', "The Maghreb Kingdom"), its name no longer referring to the city of Marrakesh. Marrakesh is known by a variety of nicknames, including the "Red City" ({{Langx|ar|المدينة الحمراء|translit=Al-madīnat al-ḥamrā'|links=no}}), the "Ochre City" and "the Daughter of the Desert", and has been the focus of poetic analogies such as one comparing the city to "a drum that beats an [[Africa]]n identity into the complex soul of Morocco."{{sfn|Rogerson|Lavington|2004|p=xi}}

==History==
{{main|History of Marrakesh|Timeline of Marrakesh}}
The Marrakesh area was inhabited by [[Berbers|Berber]] farmers from [[Neolithic]] times, and numerous stone implements have been unearthed in the area.{{sfn|Searight|1999|p=378}} Marrakesh was founded by [[Abu Bakr ibn Umar]], chieftain and second cousin of the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] king [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]] (c. 1061–1106).{{Sfn|Deverdun|1959|pp=59–64}}{{sfn|Gerteiny|1967|p=28}} Historical sources cite a variety of dates for this event ranging between 1062 (454 in the [[Hijri year|Hijri calendar]]), according to [[Ibn Abi Zar]] and [[Ibn Khaldun]], and 1078 (470 AH), according to [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]].{{Sfn|Deverdun|1959|p=61}} The date most commonly used by modern historians is 1070,{{Sfnm|1a1=Deverdun|1y=1959|1p=59–63|2a1=Messier|2y=2010|2p=180|3a1=Abun-Nasr|3y=1987|3p=83|4a1=Salmon|4y=2018|4p=33|5a1=Wilbaux|5y=2001|5p=208|6a1=Bennison|6y=2016|6p=22, 34|7a1=Lintz|7a2=Déléry |7a3=Tuil Leonetti|7y=2014|7p=565}} although 1062 is still cited by some writers.{{Sfnm|1a1=Bloom|1a2=Blair|1y=2009|1loc="Marrakesh"|2a1=Naylor|2y=2009|2p=90|3a1=Park|3a2=Boum|3y=2006|3p=238}}

The Almoravids, a Berber dynasty seeking to reform Islamic society, ruled an [[emirate]] stretching from the edge of [[Senegal]] to the centre of [[Spain]] and from the Atlantic coast to [[Algiers]].{{Sfn|Bennison|2016}} They used Marrakesh as their capital and established its first structures, including mosques and a fortified residence, the Ksar al-Hajjar, near the present-day [[Kutubiyya Mosque]].{{Sfn|Deverdun|1959|pp=56–59}} These Almoravid foundations also influenced the layout and urban organization of the city for centuries to come. For example, the present-day [[Jemaa el-Fnaa]] originated from a public square in front of the Almoravid palace gates, the ''Rahbat al-Ksar'',{{Sfn|Deverdun|1959|p=143}}<ref name="Skounti-2006">{{Cite book|last1=Skounti|first1=Ahmed|url=https://www.academia.edu/4139227|title=La Place Jemaa El Fna: patrimoine immatériel de Marrakech du Maroc et de l'humanité|last2=Tebaa|first2=Ouidad|publisher=Bureau de l’UNESCO pour le Maghreb|year=2006|location=Rabat|pages=25–27|language=fr|access-date=May 12, 2019|archive-date=November 7, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211107093440/https://www.academia.edu/4139227|url-status=live}}</ref> and the major souks (markets) of the city developed roughly in the area between this square and the city's main mosque, where they remain today.{{Sfn|Wilbaux|2001|p=115}} The city developed the community into a trading centre for the [[Maghreb]] and sub-Saharan Africa.<ref name="International2005">{{cite journal|title=The Rotarian|journal=Rotary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DjMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA14|access-date=9 October 2012|date=July 2005|publisher=Rotary International|page=14|issn=0035-838X|archive-date=26 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626185600/http://books.google.com/books?id=DjMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA14|url-status=live}}</ref> It grew rapidly and established itself as a cultural and religious centre, supplanting [[Aghmat]], which had long been the capital of [[Haouz]].

In 1125, the preacher [[Ibn Tumart]] settled in [[Tin Mal]] in the mountains to the south of Marrakesh, founding the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]] movement. This new faction, composed mainly of [[Masmuda]] tribesmen, followed a [[Almohad doctrine|doctrine of radical reform]] with Ibn Tumart as the ''[[mahdi]]'', a messianic figure. He preached against the Almoravids and influenced a revolt which succeeded in bringing about the fall of nearby [[Aghmat]], but stopped short of bringing down Marrakesh following an [[Battle of al-Buhayra|unsuccessful siege]] in 1130.{{sfn|Searight|1999|p=378}} Ibn Tumart died shortly after in the same year, but his successor [[Abd al-Mu'min]] took over the political leadership of the movement and [[Capture of Marrakesh (1147)|captured Marrakesh in 1147]] after a siege of several months.{{Sfn|Bennison|2016|p=60, 70}} The Almohads purged the Almoravid population over three days and established the city as their new capital.{{Sfn|Bennison|2016|p=307}} They went on to take over much of the Almoravids' former territory in Africa and the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. In 1147, shortly after the city's conquest, Abd al-Mu'min founded the Kutubiyya Mosque (or Koutoubia Mosque), next to the former Almoravid palace, to serve as the city's new main mosque.{{Sfn|Wilbaux|2001|p=241}} The Almoravid mosques were either demolished or abandoned as the Almohads enacted their religious reforms.{{Sfn|Bennison|2016|p=307}} Abd al-Mu'min was also responsible for establishing the [[Menara gardens|Menara Gardens]] in 1157, while his successor [[Abu Yaqub Yusuf|Abu Ya'qub Yusuf]] (r. 1163–1184) began the [[Agdal Gardens]].{{Sfn|Wilbaux|2001|p=224, 246}}<ref name="Navarro-2017">{{Cite journal|last1=Navarro|first1=Julio|last2=Garrido|first2=Fidel|last3=Almela|first3=Íñigo|date=2017|title=The Agdal of Marrakesh (Twelfth to Twentieth Centuries): An Agricultural Space for Caliphs and Sultans.

The death of [[Yusuf II, Almohad Caliph|Yusuf II]] in 1224 began a period of instability. Marrakesh became the stronghold of the Almohad tribal sheikhs and the ''ahl ad-dar'' (descendants of [[Ibn Tumart]]), who sought to claw power back from the ruling Almohad family. Marrakesh was taken, lost and retaken by force multiple times by a stream of caliphs and pretenders, such as during the brutal seizure of Marrakesh by the Sevillan caliph [[Abd al-Wahid II|Abd al-Wahid II al-Ma'mun]] in 1226, which was followed by a massacre of the Almohad tribal sheikhs and their families and a public denunciation of Ibn Tumart's doctrines by the caliph from the pulpit of the [[Kasbah Mosque (Marrakech)|Kasbah Mosque]].{{Sfn|de Cenival|1991|p=592}} After al-Ma'mun's death in 1232, his widow attempted to forcibly install her son, acquiring the support of the Almohad army chiefs and Spanish mercenaries with the promise to hand Marrakesh over to them for the [[looting|sack]]. Hearing of the terms, the people of Marrakesh sought to make an agreement with the military captains and saved the city from destruction with a sizable payoff of 500,000 dinars.{{Sfn|de Cenival|1991|p=592}} In 1269, Marrakesh was conquered by the Marinids, a Zenata tribe who overran the Almohads in Morocco. While Marrakesh remained a major city, it lost its capital status to Fez and underwent a period of relative decline.{{Sfn|de Cenival|1991|p=593}}

In the early 16th century, Marrakesh again became the capital of Morocco.

For centuries Marrakesh has been known as the location of the tombs of Morocco's [[Seven Saints of Marrakesh|seven patron saints]] (''sebaatou rizjel'').

Pilgrims visit the tombs of the saints in a specific order, as follows: [[Sidi Yusuf ibn Ali Sanhaji|Sidi Yusuf Ali Sanhaji]] (1196–97), a leper; [[Cadi Ayyad ben Moussa|Qadi Iyyad]] or [[qadi]] of [[Ceuta]] (1083–1149), a theologian and author of [[Ash-Shifa bi ta'rif huquq al-mustafa|Ash-Shifa]] (treatises on the virtues of [[Muhammad]]); [[Abu al-Abbas as-Sabti|Sidi Bel Abbas]] (1130–1204), known as the patron saint of the city and most revered in the region; [[Muhammad al-Jazuli|Sidi Muhammad al-Jazuli]] (1465), a well known Sufi who founded the Jazuli brotherhood; [[Abdelaziz al-Tebaa]] (1508), a student of al-Jazuli; [[Abdallah al-Ghazwani]] (1528), known as Moulay al-Ksour; and [[Al-Suhayli|Sidi Abu al-Qasim Al-Suhayli]], (1185), also known as Imam al-Suhayli.{{sfn|de Cenival|1991|p=591}}{{Sfn|Wilbaux|2001}} Until 1867, European Christians were not authorized to enter the city unless they acquired special permission from the sultan; east European Jews were permitted.{{sfn|Gottreich|2007|p=10}}

During the early 20th century, Marrakesh underwent several years of unrest. After the premature death in 1900 of the grand vizier [[Ba Ahmed]], who had been designated regent until the designated sultan [[Abdelaziz of Morocco|Abd al-Aziz]] became of age, the country was plagued by anarchy, tribal revolts, the plotting of feudal lords, and European intrigues. In 1907, Marrakesh caliph [[Moulay Abd al-Hafid]] was proclaimed sultan by the powerful tribes of the High Atlas and by [[Ulama]] scholars who denied the legitimacy of his brother, Abd al-Aziz.{{sfn|Loizillon|2008|p=50}} It was also in 1907 that Dr. Mauchamp, a French doctor, was murdered in Marrakesh, suspected of spying for his country.<ref>Chisholm, Hugh, General Editor. Entry for 'Marrakesh'. [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]] (1910).</ref> France used the event as a pretext for sending its troops from the eastern Moroccan town of [[Oujda]] to the major metropolitan center of Casablanca in the west. The French colonial army encountered strong resistance from [[Ahmed al-Hiba]], a son of Sheikh [[Ma al-'Aynayn]], who arrived from the Sahara accompanied by his nomadic Reguibat tribal warriors. On 30 March 1912, the French Protectorate in Morocco was established.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bibliographic Set (2 Vol Set).

The conquest was facilitated by the rallying of the Imzwarn tribes and their leaders from the powerful Glaoui family, leading to a massacre of Marrakesh citizens in the resulting turmoil.{{sfn|Barrows|2004|p=73}}

[[File:Thami El Glaoui.jpg|thumb|right|[[T'hami El Glaoui]], [[Pasha]] of Marrakesh (1912 to 1956)]]
[[T'hami El Glaoui]], known as "Lord of the Atlas", became Pasha of Marrakesh, a post he held virtually throughout the 44-year duration of the Protectorate (1912–1956).{{sfn|Lehmann|Henss|Szerelmy|2009|p=84}} Glaoui dominated the city and became famous for his collaboration with the general residence authorities, culminating in a plot to dethrone Mohammed Ben Youssef (Mohammed V) and replace him with the Sultan's cousin, [[Ben Arafa]].{{sfn|Lehmann|Henss|Szerelmy|2009|p=84}} Glaoui, already known for his amorous adventures and lavish lifestyle, became a symbol of Morocco's colonial order. He could not, however, subdue the rise of nationalist sentiment, nor the hostility of a growing proportion of the inhabitants. Nor could he resist pressure from France, who agreed to terminate its Moroccan Protectorate in 1956 due to the launch of the [[Algerian War]] (1954–1962) immediately following the end of the [[Indochina War|war]] in [[Indochina]] (1946–1954), in which Moroccans had been conscripted to fight in [[Vietnam]] on behalf of the French Army. After two successive exiles to [[Corsica]] and [[Madagascar]], Mohammed Ben Youssef was allowed to return to Morocco in November 1955, bringing an end to the despotic rule of Glaoui over Marrakesh and the surrounding region. A protocol giving independence to Morocco was then signed on 2 March 1956 between French Foreign Minister Christian Pineau and M’Barek Ben Bakkai.{{sfn|Hoisington|2004|p=109}}

Since the independence of Morocco, Marrakesh has thrived as a tourist destination. In the 1960s and early 1970s, the city became a trendy "[[Hippies|hippie]] mecca". It attracted numerous western rock stars and musicians, artists, film directors and actors, models, and fashion divas,{{sfn|Christiani|2009|p=38}} leading tourism revenues to double in Morocco between 1965 and 1970.<ref>{{cite book|title=MEED.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gthHAAAAYAAJ|page=324|access-date=8 July 2013|year=1971|publisher=Economic East Economic Digest, Limited|archive-date=26 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626185536/http://books.google.com/books?id=gthHAAAAYAAJ|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Jean-Paul Getty]] all spent significant time in the city; Laurent bought a property here and renovated the Majorelle Gardens.{{Sfn|Sullivan|2006|p=8}}{{sfn|Howe|2005|p=46}} Expatriates, especially those from France, have invested heavily in Marrakesh since the 1960s and developed many of the ''[[Riad (Morocco)|riad]]s'' and palaces.{{Sfn|Sullivan|2006|p=8}} Over the following decades, the demographic importance of the historic medina declined, due to much of it being converted from residential housing to commercial properties as well as due to the general expansion of the city beyond its traditional areas. In 1984, about 51% of the city's population lived in the medina, whereas only 22% did in 2004.{{Sfn|Bigio|2012|pp=206–207}} 

[[United Nations]] agencies became active in Marrakesh beginning in the 1970s, and the city's international political presence has subsequently grown. In 1985, [[UNESCO]] declared the old town area of Marrakesh a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], raising international awareness of the cultural heritage of the city.{{sfn|Shackley|2012|p=43}} In the 1980s, [[Patrick Guerand-Hermes]] purchased the {{Convert|30|acre}} [[Ain el Quassimou]], built by the family of [[Leo Tolstoy]]. {{sfn|Howe|2005|p=46}} On 15 April 1994, the [[Marrakesh Agreement]] was signed here to establish the [[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organisation]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/untc//Pages//doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201867/volume-1867-I-31874-English.pdf|title=Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization (with final act, annexes and protocol).

In the 21st century, property and real estate development in the city has boomed, with a dramatic increase in new hotels and shopping centres, fuelled by the policies of [[Mohammed VI of Morocco]], who aims to increase the number of tourists annually visiting Morocco to 20&nbsp;million by 2020. In 2010, a major gas explosion occurred in the city. On 28 April 2011, [[2011 Marrakesh bombing|a bomb attack took place in the Jemaa el-Fnaa square]], killing 15 people, mainly foreigners.

}}</ref> The relatively wet winter and dry summer precipitation pattern of Marrakesh mirrors precipitation patterns found in [[Mediterranean Climate|Mediterranean climates]]. However, the city receives less rain than is typically found in a Mediterranean climate, resulting in a semi-arid climate classification.

Between 1961 and 1990 the city averaged {{convert|281.3|mm|in|1}} of precipitation annually.<ref name="NOAA"/> Barrows says of the climate, "The region of Marrakesh is frequently described as desert in character, but, to one familiar with the [[Southwestern United States|southwestern parts of the United States]], the locality does not suggest the desert, rather an area of seasonal rainfall, where moisture moves underground rather than by surface streams, and where low brush takes the place of the forests of more heavily watered regions. The location of Marrakesh on the north side of the [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas]], rather than the south, prevents it from being described as a desert city, and it remains the northern focus of the Saharan lines of communication, and its history, its types of dwellers, and its commerce and arts, are all related to the great south Atlas spaces that reach further into the [[Sahara desert]]."{{sfn|Barrows|2004|p=74}}

=== Water ===
Marrakesh's water supply relies partly on groundwater resources, which have lowered gradually over the last 40 years, attaining an acute decline in the early 2000s. Since 2002, groundwater levels have dropped by an average of 0.9 m per year in 80% of Marrakesh and its surrounding area. The most affected area experienced a drop of 37 m (more than 2 m per year).<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Analy |first1=Mohammed |last2=Laftouhi |first2=Nour-Eddine |date=January 2021 |title=Groundwater Depletion in an Urban Environment under Semiarid Climate and Persistent Drought–City of Marrakesh (Morocco) |journal=Water |language=en |volume=13 |issue=22 |pages=3253 |doi=10.3390/w13223253 |issn=2073-4441|doi-access=free }}</ref>

===Jemaa el-Fnaa===
[[File:Medina of Marrakesh-110423.jpg|thumb|[[Jemaa el-Fnaa]] square]]{{Main|Jemaa el-Fnaa}}
The [[Jemaa el-Fnaa]] is one of the best-known squares in Africa and is the centre of city activity and trade. It has been described as a "world-famous square", "a metaphorical urban icon, a bridge between the past and the present, the place where (spectacularized) Moroccan tradition encounters modernity."{{sfn|Pons|Crang|Travlou|2009|p=39}} It has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage site since 1985.{{sfn|Harrison|2012|p=144}} The square's name has several possible meanings; the most plausible etymology endorsed by historians is that it meant "ruined mosque" or "mosque of annihilation", referring to the construction of a mosque within the square in the late 16th century that was left unfinished and fell into ruin.{{Sfn|Deverdun|1959|pp=590–593}}{{Sfn|Wilbaux|2001|p=263}}{{sfn|Salmon|2016|p=32}} The square was originally an open space for markets located on the east side of the ''Ksar el-Hajjar'', the main fortress and palace of the Almoravid dynasty who founded Marrakesh.{{Sfn|Deverdun|1959|p=143}}{{Sfn|Wilbaux|2001}}

Historically this square was used for public executions by rulers who sought to maintain their power by frightening the public.

Marrakesh has the largest traditional market in Morocco and the image of the city is closely associated with its ''[[souk]]s''. Historically, the souks of Marrakesh were divided into retail areas for particular goods such as leather, carpets, metalwork and pottery. These divisions still roughly exist, though with significant overlap. Many of the souks sell items like carpets and rugs, traditional Muslim attire, leather bags, and lanterns.{{sfn|Sullivan|2006|p=148}} [[Haggling]] is still a very important part of trade in the souks.{{sfn|Christiani|2009|p=51}}

The Medina is also famous for its street food. Mechoui Alley is particularly famous for selling slow-roasted lamb dishes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://millispotter.com/experience/street-food-tasting-tour-in-marrakech/|title=Street Food of Marrakech Medina|access-date=2021-05-11|archive-date=2021-05-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210513000510/https://millispotter.com/experience/street-food-tasting-tour-in-marrakech/|url-status=live}}</ref> The ''Ensemble Artisanal'', located near the Koutoubia Mosque, is a government-run complex of small arts and crafts which offers a range of leather goods, textiles and carpets.

===City walls and gates===
{{Main|Walls of Marrakesh}}
[[File:Marrakesh walls DSCF8292.jpg|left|thumb|Walls of the historic medina of Marrakesh]]
The ramparts of Marrakesh, which stretch for some {{convert|19|km}} around the medina of the city, were built by the Almoravids in the 12th century as protective fortifications. The walls are made of a distinct orange-red clay and chalk, giving the city its nickname as the "red city"; they stand up to {{convert|19|ft}} high and have 20 gates and 200 towers along them.{{sfn|Christiani|2009|p=43}}

===Gardens===
[[File:Jardins de la Ménara.jpg|left|thumb|Pavilion and reservoir of the [[Menara gardens]]]]
The city is home to a number of gardens, both historical and modern. The largest and oldest gardens in the city are the [[Menara Gardens]] to the west and the [[Agdal Gardens]] to the south. The Menara Gardens were established in 1157 by the Almohad ruler Abd al-Mu'min.<ref name="Qantara-2021">{{Cite web|title=Qantara - The garden and the pavilion of the Menara|url=https://www.qantara-med.org/public/show_document.php?do_id=1021&lang=en|access-date=2021-01-28|website=www.qantara-med.org|archive-date=2021-08-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210831025147/https://www.qantara-med.org/public/show_document.php?do_id=1021&lang=en|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Navarro-2017" /> They are centered around a large water reservoir surrounded by [[orchard]]s and [[olive grove]]s.

The Koutoubia Mosque is also flanked by another set of gardens, the Koutoubia Gardens. They feature orange and palm trees, and are frequented by storks.{{sfn|Christiani|2009|p=101}} The Mamounia Gardens, more than 100 years old and named after Prince Moulay Mamoun, have olive and orange trees as well as a variety of floral displays.{{sfn|Sullivan|2006|p=146}} In 2016,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Marescaux |first=Patrick |date=21 April 2016 |title=Jardin Anima, l'extraordinaire rêve marrakchi d'un artiste autrichien |url=https://medias24.com/2016/04/21/jardin-anima-lextraordinaire-reve-marrakchi-dun-artiste-autrichien/ |access-date=25 October 2024 |website=Médias24}}</ref> at a location between the city and the Atlas Mountains, artist [[André Heller]] opened the ANIMA garden, which combines a diverse collection of plants with a display of works by famous artists such as  [[Keith Haring]] and [[Pablo Picasso]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Foreman |first=Liza |date=12 December 2017 |title=Preserving Morocco's grand gardens |url=https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20171212-preserving-moroccos-grand-gardens |access-date=2024-10-25 |website=BBC News |language=en-GB}}</ref> In the same year, a large restored ''[[Riad (architecture)|riad]]'' garden set within a historical mansion, located inside the medina, was opened to visitors as ''Le Jardin Secret'' ('The Secret Garden').<ref name=":0" />

===Palaces and Riads===
[[File:Bahia Palace large court.jpg|thumb|Courtyard of the [[Bahia Palace]]]]
The historic wealth of the city is manifested in palaces, mansions and other lavish residences. The best-known palaces today are the [[El Badi Palace]] and the [[Bahia Palace]], as well as the main [[Kasbah of Marrakesh|Royal Palace]] which is still in use as one of the official residences of the King of Morocco. ''Riads'' (Moroccan mansions, historically designating a type of garden{{Sfn|Wilbaux|2001}}) are common in Marrakesh. Based on the design of the Roman villa, they are characterized by an open central garden courtyard surrounded by high walls. This construction provided the occupants with privacy and lowered the temperature within the building.{{sfn|Davies|2009|p=104}} Numerous riads and historic residences exist through the old city, with the oldest documented examples dating back to the Saadian period (16th-17th centuries), while many others date from the 19th and 20th centuries.{{sfn|Salmon|2016}}{{Sfn|Wilbaux|2001}}

===Mosques===
[[File:Minaret de Marrakech.jpg|thumb|right|Minaret of the [[Koutoubia Mosque]]]]
The [[Koutoubia Mosque]] is one of the largest and most famous mosques in the city, located southwest of Jemaa el-Fnaa. The mosque was founded in 1147 by the Almohad caliph Abd al-Mu'min. A second version of the mosque was entirely rebuilt by Abd al-Mu'min around 1158, with [[Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur|Ya'qub al-Mansur]] possibly finalizing construction of the [[minaret]] around 1195.{{Sfn|Deverdun|1959}} This second mosque is the structure that stands today. It is considered a major example of [[Almohad architecture]] and of [[Moroccan architecture|Moroccan mosque architecture]] generally.{{Sfn|Deverdun|1959}} Its [[minaret]] tower, the tallest in the city at {{Convert|77|m}} in height, is considered an important landmark and symbol of Marrakesh.<ref name="Gregg2007">{{cite book|last=Gregg|first=Gary S.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwajxJo_DMAC&pg=PA62|title=Culture and Identity in a Muslim Society|date=15 February 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-531003-0|page=62|access-date=7 October 2012}}</ref>{{Sfn|Wilbaux|2001|p=101}} It likely influenced other buildings such as the [[Giralda]] of [[Seville]] and the [[Hassan Tower]] of [[Rabat]].{{Sfn|Salmon|2018}}<ref name="Ewert-1992">{{Cite book|last=Ewert|first=Christian|title=Al-Andalus: The Art of Islamic Spain|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=1992|isbn=0870996371|editor-last=Dodds|editor-first=Jerrilynn D.|location=New York|pages=85–95|chapter=The Architectural Heritage of Islamic Spain in North Africa}}</ref>{{Sfn|Bennison|2016}}<ref name="Hattstein">Hattstein, Markus and Delius, Peter (eds.)

[[Ben Youssef Mosque]] is named after the Almoravid sultan Ali ibn Yusuf, who built the original mosque in the 12th century to serve as the city's main [[Congregational mosque|Friday mosque]].{{Sfn|Deverdun|1959|pp=98–99}} After being abandoned during the Almohad period and falling into ruin, it was rebuilt in the 1560s by [[Abdallah al-Ghalib]] and then completely rebuilt again [[Slimane of Morocco|Moulay Sliman]] at the beginning of the 19th century.{{Sfn|Deverdun|1959|p=516}} The 16th-century Ben Youssef Madrasa is located next to it. Also next to it is the [[Almoravid Qubba]], a rare architectural remnant of the Almoravid period which was excavated and restored in the 20th century. It is a domed kiosk that demonstrates a sophisticated style and is an important indication of the art and [[Almoravid architecture|architecture of the period]].{{Sfn|Deverdun|1959|pp=105–106}}{{Sfn|Salmon|2018}}

The [[Kasbah Mosque (Marrakech)|Kasbah Mosque]] overlooks Place Moulay Yazid in the [[Kasbah of Marrakesh|Kasbah district]] of Marrakesh, close to the El Badi Palace. It was built by the Almohad caliph Yaqub al-Mansour in the late 12th century to serve as the [[Jama Masjid|main mosque]] of the [[kasbah]] (citadel) where he and his high officials resided.{{Sfn|Deverdun|1959|pp=232–237}} It contended with the Koutoubia Mosque for prestige and the decoration of its minaret was highly influential in subsequent Moroccan architecture.{{Sfn|Deverdun|1959|p=238}} The mosque was repaired by the Saadi sultan [[Abdallah al-Ghalib|Moulay Abdallah al-Ghalib]] following a devastating explosion at a nearby gunpowder reserve in the second half of the 16th century.{{sfn|Salmon|2016|p=82}} Notably, the [[Saadian Tombs]] were built just outside its southern wall in this period.{{Sfn|Salmon|2016|pp=184–247}}

Among the other notable mosques of the city is the 14th-century [[Ben Salah Mosque]], located east of the medina centre. It is one of the only major Marinid-era monuments in the city.{{Sfn|Deverdun|1959|p=318-320}} The [[Mouassine Mosque]] (also known as the Al Ashraf Mosque) was built by the Saadian sultan Abdallah al-Ghalib between 1562–63 and 1572–73.{{sfn|Salmon|2016|pp=28–77}} It was part of a larger architectural complex which included a library, [[Hammam|hammam]] (public bathhouse), and a [[madrasa]] (school). The complex also included a large ornate street fountain known as the [[Mouassine Fountain]], which still exists today.{{Sfn|Salmon|2016|pp=28–77}}{{sfn|Christiani|2009|p=53}} The [[Bab Doukkala Mosque]], built around the same time further west, has a similar layout and style as the Mouassine Mosque. Both the Mouassine and Bab Doukkala mosques appear to have been originally designed to anchor the development of new neighbourhoods after the relocation of the Jewish district from this area to the new ''[[mellah]]'' near the Kasbah.{{Sfn|Salmon|2016|pp=28–77}}{{Sfn|Wilbaux|2001|pp=256–263}}{{Sfn|Deverdun|1959|pp=363–373}}

===Tombs===
[[File:Saadian Tombs (5038944236) (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Saadian Tombs]]]]
One of the most famous funerary monuments in the city is the [[Saadian Tombs]], which were built in the 16th century as a royal necropolis for the Saadian Dynasty. It is located next to the south wall of the Kasbah Mosque. The necropolis contains the tombs of many Saadian rulers including [[Mohammed al-Shaykh|Muhammad al-Shaykh]], Abdallah al-Ghalib, and [[Ahmad al-Mansur]], as well as various family members and later sultans.{{Sfn|Salmon|2016|pp=184–247}} It consists of two main structures, each with several rooms, standing within a garden enclosure. The most important graves are marked by horizontal tombstones of finely carved marble, while others are merely covered in colorful ''[[zellij]]'' tiles. Al-Mansur's mausoleum chamber is especially rich in decoration, with a roof of carved and painted cedar wood supported on twelve columns of [[carrara marble]], and with walls decorated with [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] in ''zellij'' tilework and [[Arabesque|vegetal motifs]] in carved [[stucco]]. The chamber next to it, originally a prayer room equipped with a ''[[mihrab]]'', was later repurposed as a mausoleum for members of the [[Alawi dynasty]].{{Sfn|Salmon|2016|pp=184–247}}{{Sfn|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=189}}

The city also holds the tombs of many Sufi figures. Of these, there are [[Seven Saints of Marrakesh|seven patron saints of the city]], which are visited every year by pilgrims during the seven-day ''[[Ziyarat|ziyara]]'' pilgrimage. During this time, pilgrims visit the tombs in the following order: [[Sidi Yusuf ibn Ali Sanhaji]], [[Qadi Ayyad|Sidi al-Qadi Iyyad al-Yahsubi]], [[Abu al-Abbas as-Sabti|Sidi Bel Abbas]], [[Muhammad al-Jazuli|Sidi Mohamed ibn Sulayman al-Jazouli]], [[Abdelaziz al-Tebaa|Sidi Abdellaziz Tabba'a]], [[Abdallah al-Ghazwani|Sidi Abdellah al-Ghazwani]], and lastly, [[Al-Suhayli|Sidi Abderrahman al-Suhayli]].<ref name="dar-sirr.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.dar-sirr.com/Patron_Saints_of_Marrakech.html|title=The Patron Saints of Marrakech|publisher=Dar Sirr|access-date=21 October 2012|archive-date=5 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005051258/http://www.dar-sirr.com/Patron_Saints_of_Marrakech.html|url-status=live}}</ref>{{Sfn|Deverdun|1959|p=574}} Many of these mausoleums also serve as the focus of their own [[Zawiya (institution)|zawiyas]] ([[Sufism|Sufi]] religious complexes with mosques), including: the [[Zawiya of Sidi Bel Abbes|Zawiya and mosque of Sidi Bel Abbes]] (the most important of them),{{sfn|VorheesEdsall|2005|p=285}} the [[Zawiya of Muhammad Ben Sliman al-Jazuli|Zawiya of al-Jazuli]], the [[Zawiya of Sidi Abd el-Aziz|Zawiya of Sidi Abdellaziz]], the Zawiya of [[Sidi Yusuf ibn Ali Sanhaji|Sidi Yusuf ibn Ali]], and the Zawiya of [[Abdallah al-Ghazwani|Sidi al-Ghazwani]] (also known as Moulay el-Ksour).{{Sfn|Wilbaux|2001|pp=107–109}}

===Mellah===
The [[Mellah of Marrakesh]] is the old Jewish Quarter (''[[Mellah]]'') of the city, and is located in the kasbah area of the city's medina, east of Place des Ferblantiers. It was created in 1558 by the Saadians at the site where the sultan's stables were.{{sfn|Gottreich|2003|p=287}} At the time, the Jewish community consisted of a large portion of the city's tailors, metalworkers, bankers, jewelers, and sugar traders. During the 16th century, the Mellah had its own fountains, gardens, synagogues and souks. Until the arrival of the French in 1912, Jews could not own property outside of the Mellah; all growth was consequently contained within the limits of the neighborhood, resulting in narrow streets, small shops and higher residential buildings. The Mellah, today reconfigured as a mainly residential zone renamed Hay Essalam, currently occupies an area smaller than its historic limits and has an almost entirely Muslim population. The [[Slat al-Azama Synagogue]] (or Lazama Synagogue), built around a central courtyard, is in the Mellah.<ref name="Larson2012">{{cite news|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/travel/vacations/marrakesh_express|title=The Marrakesh Express|last=Larson|first=Hilary|date=May 8, 2012|newspaper=The Jewish Week|access-date=21 October 2012|archive-date=17 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517192420/http://www.thejewishweek.com/travel/vacations/marrakesh_express|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Jewish Cemetery of Marrakech|Jewish cemetery]] here is the largest of its kind in Morocco.

===Music, theatre and dance===
Two types of music are traditionally associated with Marrakesh. [[Music of Morocco|Moroccan music]] is influenced by Andalusian classical music and typified by its ''[[oud]]'' accompaniment. By contrast, [[Gnaoua]] music is loud and funky with a sound reminiscent of the Blues. It is performed on handmade instruments such as [[castanets]], ''ribabs'' (three-stringed banjos) and ''deffs'' (handheld drums). Gnaoua music's rhythm and crescendo take the audience into a mood of trance; the style is said to have emerged in Marrakesh and [[Essaouira]] as a ritual of deliverance from slavery.{{sfn|Bing|2011|pp=154–6}} More recently, several Marrakesh female music groups have also risen to popularity.{{sfn|Bing|2011|pp=154–156}}

The [[Théâtre Royal de Marrakesh]], the [[Institut Français (Marrakesh)|Institut Français]] and [[Dar Cherifa|Dar Chérifa]] are major performing arts institutions in the city. The Théâtre Royal, built by Tunisian architect [[Charles Boccara]], puts on theatrical performances of [[comedy]], [[opera]], and [[dance]] in Arabic and French.{{sfn|Christiani|2009|p=134}} A great number of storytellers, musicians and others also perform outdoor shows to entertain locals and tourists on the Jemaa el-Fnaa, especially at night.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ben Ismaïl |first=Ahmed |title=Cultural space of Jemaa el-Fna Square |url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/cultural-space-of-jemaa-el-fna-square-00014 |access-date=2024-10-25 |website=UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage |language=en}}</ref>

===Crafts===
[[File:Hats on Marrakesh market.jpg|thumb|Locally made hats]]
The arts and crafts of Marrakesh have had a wide and enduring impact on Moroccan handicrafts to the present day. Riad décor is widely used in carpets and textiles, ceramics, woodwork, metal work and ''zelij''. Carpets and textiles are weaved, sewn or embroidered, sometimes used for upholstering. Moroccan women who practice craftsmanship are known as ''Maalems'' (expert craftspeople) and make such fine products as Arabic and Berber carpets and shawls made of ''sabra'' (another name for [[rayon]], also sometimes called cactus silk).{{sfn|Bing|2011|pp=154–156}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=WEAVING A STORY → Franklin Till |url=https://www.franklintill.com/journal/weaving-a-story |access-date=2023-08-22 |website=www.franklintill.com |archive-date=2023-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230928145111/https://www.franklintill.com/journal/weaving-a-story |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UccqN88XifoC |title=TRAVEL WEEKLY |date=2006 |publisher=Reed Business Information Limited |pages=93 |language=en}}</ref> Ceramics are in varying styles in monochrome, a limited tradition depicting bold forms and decorations.{{sfn|Bing|2011|pp=154–156}}

Wood crafts are generally made of [[Cedar wood|cedar]], including the ''riad'' doors and palace ceilings. [[Orange wood]] is used for making [[ladle (spoon)|ladle]]s known as ''harira'' (lentil soup ladles). ''[[Thuya]]'' craft products are made of caramel coloured ''[[Tetraclinis|thuya]]'', a [[conifer]] indigenous to Morocco. Since this species is almost extinct, these trees are being replanted and promoted by the artists' cooperative Femmes de Marrakech.{{sfn|Bing|2011|pp=154–156}}

Metalwork made in Marrakesh includes [[brass]] lamps, iron lanterns, [[candle]] holders made from recycled [[sardine]] tins, and engraved brass teapots and tea trays used in the traditional serving of tea. Contemporary art includes sculpture and figurative paintings. Blue veiled ''Tuareg'' figurines and calligraphy paintings are also popular.{{sfn|Bing|2011|pp=154–156}}

===Festivals===

This education complex specialized in Quranic law and was linked to similar institutions in [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]], [[Taza]], [[Salé]], and [[Meknes]].{{sfn|Rogerson|2000|pp=100–102}} The [[Madrasa]] was constructed by the [[Saadi Dynasty|Saadian]] Sultan [[Abdallah al-Ghalib]] (1557–1574) in 1564 as the largest and most prestigious madrasa in Morocco.{{sfn|Rogerson|2000|pp=100–102}} The construction ordered by Abdallah al-Ghalib was completed in 1565, as attested by the inscription in the prayer room.{{sfn|Cheurfi|2007|p=740}} Its 130 student dormitory cells cluster around a courtyard richly carved in [[cedrus|cedar]], [[marble]] and [[stucco]]. In accordance with Islam, the carvings contain no representation of humans or animals, consisting entirely of inscriptions and geometric patterns. One of the school's best known teachers was [[Mohammed al-Ifrani]] (1670–1745). After a temporary closure beginning in 1960, the building was refurbished and reopened to the public as a historical site in 1982.{{sfn|Michelin|2001|p=363}}

==Healthcare==
Marrakesh has long been an important centre for healthcare in [[Morocco]], and the regional rural and urban populations alike are reliant upon hospitals in the city. The psychiatric hospital installed by the Merinid Caliph [[Ya'qub al-Mansur]] in the 16th century was described by the historian [[Abdelwahid al-Marrakushi|'Abd al-Wahfd al- Marrakushi]] as one of the greatest in the world at the time.{{sfn|Laet|1994|p=344}} A strong Andalusian influence was evident in the hospital, and many of the physicians to the Caliphs came from places such as [[Seville]], [[Zaragoza]] and [[Denia]] in eastern Spain.{{sfn|Laet|1994|p=344}}

A severe strain has been placed upon the healthcare facilities of the city in the last decade as the city population has grown dramatically.<ref name="OFID">{{cite web|url=http://www.ofid.org/NewsPress/tabid/87/ArticleId/150/Morocco-expands-hospital-services-with-US-8-million-OPEC-Fund-loan.aspx|title=Morocco expands hospital services with US$8 million OPEC Fund loan|publisher=[[The OPEC Fund for International Development]]|date=9 February 2001|access-date=19 October 2012|archive-date=26 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926214636/http://www.ofid.org/NewsPress/tabid/87/ArticleId/150/Morocco-expands-hospital-services-with-US-8-million-OPEC-Fund-loan.aspx|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Ibn Tofail University Hospital]] is one of the major hospitals of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-214554024.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525140027/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-214554024.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 May 2013|title=Marrakech attack, terrorist act resulting from strong explosion caused by an explosive device|publisher=[[Agence Maghreb Arabe Presse]] (MAP) |date=28 April 2011|access-date=18 October 2012}}</ref> In February 2001, the Moroccan government signed a loan agreement worth eight million U.S. dollars with [[The OPEC Fund for International Development]] to help improve medical services in and around Marrakesh, which led to expansions of the Ibn Tofail and [[Ibn Nafess Hospital|Ibn Nafess]] hospitals.
