'''Valle del Cauca''', or '''Cauca Valley''' ({{IPA|es|ˈbaʎe ðel ˈkawka}}), is a [[Departments of Colombia|department]] in western [[Colombia]] abutting the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Its capital is [[Cali|Santiago de Cali]]. Other cities such as [[Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca|Buenaventura]], [[Buga, Valle del Cauca|Buga]], [[Cartago, Valle del Cauca|Cartago]], [[Palmira, Valle del Cauca|Palmira]] and [[Tuluá]] have great economical, political, social and cultural influence on the department's life. Valle del Cauca has the largest number of independent (i.e., nonmetropolitan) towns with over 100,000 inhabitants in the country, counting six within its borders.<ref name="autogenerated54">[http://www.dane.gov.co/censo/files/libroCenso2005nacional.pdf Official census Book, p. 54 (Spanish)(+ 70 mb file)]</ref> Buenaventura has the largest and busiest seaport in Colombia, moving about 8,500,000 tons of merchandise annually.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sprbun.com/informacion-para-comercio-exterior/estadisticas/acumulado_ano.php |title=Official Buenaventura's port statistics (Spanish) |publisher=Sprbun.com |access-date=17 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007042442/http://www.sprbun.com/informacion-para-comercio-exterior/estadisticas/acumulado_ano.php |archive-date=7 October 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2022}}
The department of Valle del Cauca is located in the western part of the country, between 3°&nbsp;5′&nbsp;N and 5°&nbsp;1′&nbsp;N latitude and 75°&nbsp;42′&nbsp;W and 77°&nbsp;33′&nbsp;W longitude. It borders the departments of [[Risaralda Department|Risaralda]] and [[Quindío Department|Quindío]] to the north, [[Cauca Department|Cauca]] to the south, [[Tolima Department|Tolima]] to the east, and [[Chocó Department|Chocó]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west. The valley is geographically bounded by the [[Cordillera Central (Colombia)|Cordillera Central]] and [[Cordillera Occidental (Colombia)|Occidental]] and is watered by numerous rivers that empty into the [[Cauca River]]. The department is divided into four zones: the Pacific Fringe, which is humid and mostly jungle; the western mountain range, also humid and full of jungle, heavily [[deforestation|deforested]] because of the paper industry; the Andean valley of the Cauca River, whose surrounding lands are the most fertile in the country; and the western ridge of the Cordillera Central. Valle del Cauca also administers [[Malpelo Island]] in the Pacific.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2022}}
===Prehistory===

====Hunter-gatherer societies====
[[Palynology|Palynological]] analyses performed by experts have determined that during the Superior [[Pleistocene]] some 40,000–10,500 years ago, the valleys of El Dorado and Alto Calima had Andean forests and sub-Andean vegetation. The discovery of projectiles indicated that there were communities of [[hunter-gatherer]]s at the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the [[Holocene]]. The extinction of the Pleistocenic megafauna in the beginning of the Holocene forced humans to adapt to their new environment, becoming hunter-gatherers. In the lower basin of the [[Calima River]] (Sauzalito River, El Recreo River, and El Pital River), archaeologists found the oldest traces of hunter-gatherers who inhabited the Valley of the [[Cauca River]]. According to these, in 5000&nbsp;BC these societies already had some level of primitive agriculture and cultivated [[maize]]. There is little information about the years between 3000 and 1500&nbsp;BC.

|[[Image:Tardio 2.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Late Period&nbsp;II cultures (c.&nbsp;1400–1600)]]}}

====Ancient agricultural–pottery societies (1500 BC – 600 AD)====
In 1500&nbsp;BC the first agricultural–pottery society, the [[Calima culture#Ilama culture|Ilama culture]], appeared, extending along the [[Calima River]] (in what is now the towns of [[Restrepo, Valle del Cauca|Restrepo]] and [[Calima, Valle del Cauca|Darién]]). Its society had a social structure of ''cacicazgos'' ("chiefdoms") that prevailed until the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|arrival of the Spaniards]]. The Ilama economy was based on migratory agriculture using [[maize]], [[Cassava|yuca]], and beans; hunting; fishing; textile manufacturing; and metallurgy. The chief or ''cacique'' was the head of the settlement and had ''chamanes'' ("spiritual leaders"), warriors, farmers, hunters, pottery men, and goldsmiths. By 100&nbsp;AD, the Ilama had developed into the [[Calima culture|Yotoco]], whom expanded the region of the Ilama further, down the Cauca River to the Pacific Ocean, and southward to the present-day region of [[Cali|Santiago de Cali (Cali)]].

The [[Calima culture|Yotoco]] were a highly stratified society, headed by ''caciques'', who managed several settlements. They existed in the region until around 1200&nbsp;AD. A rising population forced them to develop effective agricultural systems to meet food demand, which improved pottery and metalworking techniques. Yotoco agriculture — based on maize, yuca, beans, [[arracacha]], and [[achiote]], among other foods - was more diverse than that of the Ilama. The Yotoco experienced a decline beginning in the 6th century&nbsp;AD.

====Pre-Columbian agricultural–pottery societies (600–1600)====
This archeological period is called the Late Period and is divided into Late Period&nbsp;I (6th to 13th centuries) and Late Period&nbsp;II (14th to 16th centuries). In Late Period&nbsp;I the Valle del Cauca region was inhabited by the early [[Sonso culture]], Bolo, Sachamate, and La Llanada. During Late Period&nbsp;II the region was inhabited by the late Sonso culture, Pichinde, Buga, and Quebrada Seca. Their development is attributed to population growth. Almost all the settlers in the area became subject to the rule of one main ''cacique''.

===Arrival of the Spanish and conquest===

The first 67 Spanish explorers arrived in the area after founding the village of [[Popayán]], in an expedition from [[Quito]] headed by [[Sebastián de Belalcázar]]. In the Valle del Cauca the explorers founded the village of [[Villa de Ampudia]], named after one of them, [[Juan de Ampudia]]. By orders of Belalcázar the village was then moved to the Riviera of the Cauca River, within the Gorrones indigenous people's territory. In 1536, a Captain Muñoz ordered the city to be moved to the Valley, where the Village of [[Cali]] was founded on 25 July of that same year. Another Spanish explorer, {{Interlanguage link multi|Juan de Vadillo|es}}, coming from the village of [[Cartagena de Indias]], entered Cali on 23 December 1538 with a second group of explorers, but he returned to Cartagena, leaving many of his men behind including [[Pedro Cieza de León]]. A third group of explorers, led by Admiral [[Jorge Robledo (conquistador)|Jorge Robledo]] under orders of {{Interlanguage link multi|Lorenzo de Aldana|es}}, advanced to the North of the Valle del Cauca and founded the villages of [[Anserma, Caldas|Anserma]] (now part of [[Caldas Department]]; 15 August 1539), [[Cartago, Colombia|Cartago]] (9 August 1540), and [[Medellín|Antioquia]] (25 November 1541), and under command of [[Pascual de Andagoya]] who came from [[Panama]] to Cali with a fourth group of explorers.

===Department of Valle del Cauca===
{{see also|History of Santiago de Cali}} The Department of Valle del Cauca was created by decree number 340 on April 16, 1910, which created 12 other departments in Colombia. The Valle del Cauca Department was a result of the union of four former departments: [[Cartago Department|Cartago]], [[Buga Department|Buga]], and [[Cali Department|Cali]].

==Government==
The government of Valle del Cauca is similar to the central [[government of Colombia]], which has three branches of power: executive, legislative, and judicial, along with various ''control agencies'' with oversight capacity. The executive branch in Valle del Cauca is represented by the [[governor of Valle del Cauca Department|governor]], the legislative branch is represented by the [[Department Assembly of Valle del Cauca|department assembly]] and its deputies, and the judicial branch is represented by four department-wide court systems: the [[Superior Tribunal of Cali]], the [[Penal Court of the Circuit of Cali]], the [[Administrative Tribunal of Valle del Cauca]], and the [[Superior Military Tribunal]] for military cases. Valle del Cauca has 42 municipalities, each with a mayor, who is a popularly elected representative of the governor.

==Economy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2022}}
Valle del Cauca has a diversified economy. Its valley contains [[sugarcane]], cotton, [[soy]], and [[sorghum]] crops, and there are coffee crops in the mountains. The department is known for its sugar industry, which provides sugar to the markets of the rest of the country and nearby countries. The sugar is obtained from the large sugar cane plantations, which were introduced to the department by [[Sebastián de Belalcázar]]. The production by the city of Yumbo also stands out, where several companies are found, most prominently the paper and cement businesses. The port at [[Buenaventura, Colombia|Buenaventura]] is Colombia's main port on the Pacific coast, allowing for the import and export of goods, and is of great importance for the economy of both the department and the country.

==Culture==

===Architecture===

The Cauca Valley was historically a place dedicated to cattle and agricultural activities. For this reason, the region has not developed an artistic and European-influenced architectural style, as the relative near city of [[Popayán]], located in the [[Cauca Department|department of Cauca]]; instead, the department generates simple and pragmatic constructions, with a few exceptions. The material of the colonial constructions was basically of wood and bricks, with some use of stones.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

===Cuisine===

The food most closely associated with the department is ''[[sancocho]] de gallina'', a stew made with an old hen, potatoes, yucca, corn, and other ingredients; the characteristic flavor comes from a herb called ''cimarrón'' or ''recao'' (''[[Eryngium foetidum]]'').{{cn|date=December 2022}}
