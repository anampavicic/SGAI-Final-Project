==History==
{{For timeline}}

===Early settlement===
The area of present-day Fayetteville was historically inhabited by various [[Siouan]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] peoples, such as the [[Eno people|Eno]], [[Shakori]], [[Waccamaw Siouan|Waccamaw]], Keyauwee, and [[Cape Fear Indians|Cape Fear]] people. They followed successive cultures of other indigenous peoples in the area for more than 12,000 years.

After the violent upheavals of the [[Yamasee War]] and [[Tuscarora War]]s during the second decade of the 18th century, the colonial government of [[Province of North Carolina|North Carolina]] encouraged colonial settlement along the upper [[Cape Fear River]], the only navigable waterway entirely within the colony. Two inland settlements, Cross Creek and Campbellton, were established by [[Scottish people|Scots]] from [[Campbeltown]], [[Argyll and Bute]], [[Scotland]].

Merchants in [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] wanted a town on the Cape Fear River to secure trade with the frontier country. They were afraid people would use the [[Pee Dee River]] and transport their goods to [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. The merchants bought land from Newberry in Cross Creek. Campbellton became a place where poor whites and free blacks lived and gained a reputation for lawlessness.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fayetteville, North Carolina |url=https://www.carolana.com/NC/Towns/Fayetteville_NC.html |access-date=2022-11-06 |website=www.carolana.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Marker: I-54 |url=http://www.ncmarkers.com/Markers.aspx?MarkerId=I-54 |access-date=2022-11-06 |website=www.ncmarkers.com |archive-date=November 6, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221106152120/http://www.ncmarkers.com/Markers.aspx?MarkerId=I-54 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1783, Cross Creek and Campbellton united, and the new town was incorporated as Fayetteville in honor of [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette]], a French military hero who significantly aided the American forces during the war.<ref name="Ency">''Encyclopedia of North Carolina'', 3rd ed., Vol. 2 (1999), p. 254.</ref> Fayetteville was the first city to be named in his honor in the United States.<ref name="Ency"/> Lafayette visited the city on March 4 and 5, 1825, during his [[Visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the United States|grand tour of the United States]].<ref name="Ency"/>

===American Revolution===
[[File:Center tile of the floor of the Market House.jpg|thumb|right|Center tile of floor of the Market House which served as a town market until 1906]]
[[File:Libertypointnc.jpg|thumb|right|Liberty Point in Fayetteville, where the "Liberty Point Resolves" were signed in June 1775]]
[[File:Cool spring.jpg|thumb|right|The Cool Spring Tavern, built in 1788, is the oldest structure in Fayetteville. Most earlier structures were destroyed by the "great fire" of 1831.]]
The local region was heavily settled by Scots in the mid/late 1700s, and most of these were [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking [[Scottish Highlands|Highlanders]]. The vast majority of Highland Scots, recent immigrants, remained loyal to the British government and rallied to the call to arms from the Royal Governor. Despite this, they were eventually defeated by a larger Revolutionary force at the [[Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge]]. The area also included several active Revolutionaries.

In late June 1775, residents drew up the "[[Liberty Point Resolves]]," which preceded the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] by a little more than a year. It said,
<blockquote>"This obligation to continue in full force until a reconciliation shall take place between Great Britain and America, upon constitutional principles, an event we most ardently desire; and we will hold all those persons inimical to the liberty of the colonies, who shall refuse to subscribe to this Association; and we will in all things follow the advice of our General Committee respecting the purposes aforesaid, the preservation of peace and good order, and the safety of individual and private property."</blockquote> Robert Rowan, who apparently organized the group, signed first.

Robert Rowan (circa 1738–1798) was one of the area's leading public figures of the 18th century. A merchant and entrepreneur, he settled in Cross Creek in the 1760s. He served as an officer in the [[French and Indian War]], as [[sheriff]], justice and legislator, and as a leader of the Patriot cause in the Revolutionary War. Rowan Street and Rowan Park in Fayetteville and a local chapter of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] are named for him, though [[Rowan County, North Carolina|Rowan County]] (founded in 1753) was named for his uncle, Matthew Rowan.

[[Flora MacDonald]] (1722–1790), a Scots Highland woman known for aiding [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]] after his Highlander army's defeat at [[Battle of Culloden|Culloden]] in 1746, lived in North Carolina for about five years. She was a staunch [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] and aided her husband in raising the local Scots to fight for the King against the Revolution.

Seventy-First Township in western Cumberland County (now a part of Fayetteville) is named for a British regiment during the American Revolution – the [[71st Regiment of Foot, Fraser's Highlanders|71st Regiment of Foot]] or "Fraser's Highlanders", as they were first called.

===Post-revolution===
{{See also|Fayetteville Convention}}
Fayetteville had what is sometimes called its "golden decade" during the 1780s. It was the site in 1789 for the state convention that ratified the [[U.S. Constitution]], and for the [[North Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]] session that chartered the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. Fayetteville lost out to the future city of [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] in the bid to become the permanent state capital.

In 1793, the Fayetteville Independent Light Infantry formed and is still active as a ceremonial unit. It is the second-oldest [[militia]] unit in the country.

Henry Evans (circa 1760–1810), a free black preacher, is locally known as the "Father of Methodism" in the area. Evans was a [[shoemaker]] by trade and a licensed [[Methodist]] preacher. He met opposition from whites when he began preaching to  [[slavery in the United States|enslaved people]] in Fayetteville, but he later attracted whites to his services. He is credited with building the first church in town, the African Meeting House, in 1796. Evans Metropolitan [[AME Zion Church]] is named in his honor.

On March 4–5, 1825, General Lafayette visited his namesake town - the first one named for him and the only one he personally visited<ref>{{cite web |title=Lafayette's Visit |url=https://ncpedia.org/lafayettes-visit |website=NCPedia |access-date=26 March 2024}}</ref> as part of his 1824-1825 tour of all the states as "[[Visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the United States|The Nation's Guest]]." Admirers stood in mud and pouring rain to welcome him. He was feted with a formal dinner, a ball, and multiple military displays.<ref name="Fayetteville Observer March 10, 1825">{{cite web|url=https://lafayette250.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Observer_article_Lafayette_visit_March_10_1825_ver_5.pdf|title=Fayetteville Observer March 10, 1825}}</ref>

===Antebellum===
Fayetteville had 3,500 residents in 1820, but [[Cumberland County, North Carolina|Cumberland County]]'s population still ranked as the second most urban in the state, behind [[New Hanover County, North Carolina|New Hanover County]] (Wilmington). Its "Great Fire" of 1831 was believed to be one of the worst in the nation's history, despite no deaths associated with the incident. Hundreds of homes, businesses, and most of the best-known public buildings were lost, including the old "State House". Fayetteville leaders moved quickly to help the victims and rebuild the town.<ref>{{cite web |title=Citywide Fire in Fayetteville, 1831 |url=https://www.ncdcr.gov/blog/2015/05/29/citywide-fire-in-fayetteville-1831 |website=This Day in North Carolina History |publisher=N.C.

There was no point in rebuilding the State House since the state government was firmly installed in [[Raleigh]]. On its site, the city built a  [[Market House (Fayetteville, North Carolina)|Market House]], recreating the city around it just as it had previously surrounded the State House. The new building had a covered area under which business could be conducted since every store in Fayetteville had been destroyed in the fire. Completed in 1832, it became the town's and county's administrative building. It was a town market until 1906 and served as Fayetteville Town Hall until 1907. Currently (2020), it is a local history museum.

===The Civil War era through late 19th century===

In March 1865, Gen. [[William T. Sherman]] and his 60,000-man army attacked Fayetteville and destroyed the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[arsenal]] (designed by the Scottish architect [[William Bell (architect)|William Bell]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Bell, William (1789-1865) : NC Architects & Builders : NCSU Libraries |url=http://ncarchitects.lib.ncsu.edu/people/P000015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416031104/http://ncarchitects.lib.ncsu.edu/people/P000015 |archive-date=2015-04-16 |access-date=2015-04-15}}</ref> Sherman's troops also destroyed foundries and cotton factories, and the offices of ''[[The Fayetteville Observer]]''. Not far from Fayetteville, Confederate and [[Union Army|Union]] troops engaged in the last [[cavalry]] battle of the Civil War, the [[Battle of Monroe's Crossroads]].

Downtown Fayetteville was the site of a skirmish, as Confederate Lt. Gen. [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]] and his men surprised a cavalry patrol, killing 11 Union soldiers and capturing a dozen on March 11, 1865.

During the late nineteenth century, North Carolina adopted [[Jim Crow]] laws that imposed [[racial segregation]].

===20th century to present===

Cumberland County's population increased in the post-[[World War II]] years, with its 43% increase in the 1960s the largest in any of North Carolina's 100 counties. Construction was fast-paced as shopping developments, and suburban subdivisions began to spread outside the Fayetteville city limits toward [[Fort Liberty]] and [[Pope Air Force Base]]. The Fayetteville and Cumberland County school systems moved toward [[racial integration|integration]] gradually, beginning in the early 1960s; [[desegregation busing|busing]] brought about wider-scale student integration in the 1970s.

Segregation of public facilities continued. Marches and sit-ins during the [[Civil Rights Movement]], with students from Fayetteville State Teachers College ([[Fayetteville State University]]) at the forefront, led to the end of whites-only service at restaurants and segregated seating in theaters. Blacks and women gained office in significant numbers from the late 1960s to the early 1980s.

The [[Vietnam Era]] was a time of change in the Fayetteville area. From 1966 to 1970, more than 200,000 soldiers trained at Fort Bragg (now Fort Liberty) before leaving for Vietnam. This buildup stimulated area businesses. [[Anti-war protest]]s in Fayetteville drew national attention because of Fort Bragg, a city that generally supported the war. Anti-war groups invited the actress and activist [[Jane Fonda]] to Fayetteville to participate in three anti-war events. The era also saw an increase in crime and drug addiction, especially along Hay Street, with media giving the city the nickname "Fayettenam".<ref>{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=David T.|title=Murder Along the Cape Fear: A North Carolina Town in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ey7AxeX7olgC&pg=PA228|year=2005|publisher=Mercer University Press|isbn=978-0-86554-966-1|page=228}}<br />{{cite book|last=Rottman|first=Gordon L.|title=Grunt Slang in Vietnam: Words of the War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f7HMDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT58|date=4 February 2020|publisher=Casemate Publishers|isbn=978-1-5040-6170-4|page=58}}<br />{{cite book|last=Fry|first=Joseph A.|title=The American South and the Vietnam War: Belligerence, Protest, and Agony in Dixie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AK2kCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA339|date=19 June 2015|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-6109-9|page=339}}<br />{{cite book|last=Baca|first=George|title=Conjuring Crisis: Racism and Civil Rights in a Southern Military City|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rqMmc07eakoC&pg=PA68|date=8 June 2010|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-4979-8|page=68}}</ref> At this time, Fayetteville also made headlines after Army doctor [[Jeffrey R. MacDonald]] murdered his pregnant wife and two daughters in their Ft. Bragg home in 1970; the book and movie ''[[Fatal Vision]]'' were based on these events.

To combat the dispersal of [[suburbanization]], Fayetteville has worked to redevelop its downtown through various [[urban renewal|revitalization]] projects; it has attracted large commercial and defense companies such as Purolator, [[General Dynamics]] and [[Wal-Mart]] Stores and Distribution Center. Development of the [[Airborne & Special Operations Museum]], Fayetteville Area Transportation Museum, Fayetteville Linear Park, and Fayetteville Festival Park, which opened in late 2006, have added regional attractions to the center.

In the first decade of the 21st century, the towns and rural areas surrounding Fayetteville had rapid growth. Suburbs such as [[Hope Mills, North Carolina|Hope Mills]], [[Raeford, North Carolina|Raeford]], and [[Spring Lake, North Carolina|Spring Lake]] had population increases.

In 2005, Congress passed the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] (BRAC) Act, resulting in several new commands relocating to Fort Bragg. These include the [[U.S. Army Forces Command]] (FORSCOM) and [[U.S. Army Reserve Command]], both of which relocated from [[Fort McPherson]] in [[Atlanta]]. More than 30,000 people were expected to relocate to the area with associated businesses and families. FORSCOM awards over $300 billion in contracts annually.<ref>[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/news/article.asp?docKey=600-200909140520KRTRIB__BUSNEWS_58059-3JJD5ARHIVAK56EKHS9BNJAMIP&params=timestamp%7C%7C09/14/2009%205:20%20AM%20ET%7C%7Cheadline%7C%7CBRAC%3A%20Developers%20place%20bets%20on%20growth%20%5BThe%20Fayetteville%20Observer%2C%20N.C.%5D%7C%7CdocSource%7C%7CKnight%20Ridder/Tribune%7C%7Cprovider%7C%7CACQUIREMEDIA%7C%7Crealtedsyms%7C%7C%7CUS%3BGD&ric=GD "BRAC: Developers Place Bets on Growth"]{{dead link|date=April 2023|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, ''Fayetteville Observer''</ref>

In April 2019, a report by GoBankingRates (which analyzed data from 175 American cities) listed Fayetteville as one of the top ten American cities at risk of a severe housing crash.  26.8% of home mortgages in Fayetteville were listed as being "under water", while the median home value was listed as $108,000.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gobankingrates.com/investing/real-estate/cities-in-danger-of-housing-crisis |title=Cities in Danger of a Housing Crisis (Study 2019) &#124; GOBankingRates |access-date=2019-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528091944/https://www.gobankingrates.com/investing/real-estate/cities-in-danger-of-housing-crisis/ |archive-date=2019-05-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Several U.S. Army airborne units are stationed at Fort Liberty, most prominently the [[XVIII Airborne Corps (United States)|XVIII Airborne Corps]] HQ, the [[82nd Airborne Division]], the [[United States Army Special Operations Command]], the [[1st Special Forces Command (Airborne)]], and the United States Army [[John F.

Fort Bragg (now Fort Liberty) was the home of the Field Artillery at the onset of World War II. All the Army's [[artillery]] units east of the Mississippi River were based at the post, about 5,000 troops. Soldiers tested the Army's new bantam car, soon known as the [[Willys MB|Jeep]], although most of the power to move artillery still came from horses and burros. On September 12, 1940, the Army contracted to expand the post, bringing the [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]] to Fort Bragg.

The mission of Pope Field is to provide [[airlift]] to American armed forces and humanitarian missions flown worldwide. Pope Field mainly includes air transportation for the 82nd Airborne, among other airborne units on Fort Liberty.

All of Pope's [[fighter jet]] squadrons have been relocated to [[Moody AFB]], Georgia. The central entity at Pope is now the Air Force Reserve, although they still have a small number of active personnel.

In September 2008, Fayetteville annexed 85% of Fort Bragg (now Fort Liberty), bringing the city's population to 206,000. Fort Liberty retains its police, fire, and EMS services. Fayetteville hopes to attract large retail businesses to the area using the new population figures.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mims|first=Bryan|title=Bragg annexation could boost Fayetteville's retail scene|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/3552006/|access-date=April 20, 2012|newspaper=WRAL|date=September 16, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722123358/http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/3552006/|archive-date=July 22, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

On September 5, 2008, Cumberland County announced it was the "World's First Sanctuary for Soldiers and Their Families"; it marked major roads with blue and white "Sanctuary" signage. Within the county, soldiers were to be provided with local services, ranging from free childcare to job placement for soldiers' spouses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fayettevillewantsyou.com/pressroom/content/press-coverage/091608-PostEventRelease.local.pdf|title=Fayetteville Wants You|access-date=2009-03-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710230456/http://fayettevillewantsyou.com/pressroom/content/press-coverage/091608-PostEventRelease.local.pdf|archive-date=2011-07-10|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Five hundred volunteers have signed up to watch over military families. They were recruited to offer one-to-one services; member businesses will also offer discounts and preferential treatment. ''Time'' magazine recognized Fayetteville for its support of military families and identified it as "America's Most Pro-Military Town".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1860898,00.html|title=Fayetteville: America's Most Pro-Military Town|first=Nathan|last=Thornburgh|date=20 November 2008|via=www.time.com|access-date=31 March 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404001255/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1860898,00.html|archive-date=4 April 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>
