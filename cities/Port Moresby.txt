{{nowrap|'''Port Moresby'''}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɔər|z|b|i}}; [[Tok Pisin]]: ''Pot Mosbi''), also referred to as '''Pom City''' or simply '''Moresby''', is the capital and largest city of [[Papua New Guinea]]. It is one of the largest cities in the southwestern [[Pacific]] (along with [[Jayapura]]) outside of Australia and New Zealand. It is located on the shores of the [[Gulf of Papua]], on the south-western coast of the [[Papuan Peninsula]] of the island of [[New Guinea]]. The city emerged as a trade centre in the second half of the 19th century. During [[World War II]], it was a prime objective for conquest by the [[Japan during World War II|Imperial Japanese]] forces during 1942&ndash;43 as a staging point and air base to cut off Australia from [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Americas]]. Due to its population and outsized influence compared to other cities in Papua New Guinea, Port Moresby may be regarded as a [[primate city]].

As of the 2011 census, Port Moresby had 364,145 inhabitants. An unofficial 2020 estimate gives the population as 383,000.<ref>{{cite web|title=CIA World Factbook|url=}}{{full citation needed|date=October 2023}}</ref> The place where the city was founded has been inhabited by the [[Motu people|Motu-Koitabu]] people for centuries. The first Briton to see it was [[Royal Navy]] Captain [[John Moresby]] in 1873. It was named in honour of his father, [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] Sir [[Fairfax Moresby]].

Although Port Moresby is surrounded by [[Central Province (Papua New Guinea)|Central Province]], of which it is also the capital, it is not part of that province but forms the [[National Capital District (Papua New Guinea)|National Capital District]]. The traditional landowners, the Motu and Koitabu people, are represented by the [[Motu Koita Assembly]].

Port Moresby hosted the [[APEC_Papua_New_Guinea_2018|APEC summit]] in November 2018.<ref name="APEC">{{cite news |last=Tlozek |first=Eric |date=30 June 2018 |title=Security in PNG's Port Moresby under spotlight as APEC summit approaches |work=ABC |location=Port Moresby |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-30/security-in-port-moresby-png-issue-ahead-of-apec-summit/9920752 |access-date=17 November 2022}}</ref> However, there were concerns about security given the capital's reputation for violent crime.<ref name=APEC/>

==History==
[[File:A Hiri expedition in the 1990s.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A [[Hiri expedition]] arriving in Port Moresby in the 1990s]]

===Before colonisation===
Prior to the arrival of Europeans to the region, it was inhabited by the [[Motu people|Motu-Koitabu]]. The Motu were originally coastal dwellers, while the Koitabu lived more inland.<ref name="Goddard">{{cite journal |last1=Goddard |first1=Michael |title=Rethinking Western Motu Descent Groups |journal=Oceania |date=June 2001 |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=313–333 |doi=10.1002/j.1834-4461.2001.tb02756.x |jstor=40332111 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40332111 |access-date=12 February 2023|hdl=1959.13/26788 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> There was significant intermarriage between these two groups. They were organized into units called ''iduhu'', which are somewhat similar to clans.<ref name="Goddard" />

===Colonisation===

In 1883, [[Queensland]] attempted to annex the south-eastern corner of the New Guinea Island (subsequently known as Papua), fearing that Germany would take control of the entire eastern half of the island.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gordon |first1=Donald C. |title='Beginnings of an Australasian Pacific Policy' |journal=Political Science Quarterly |date=1945 |volume=60 |issue=1 |page=85 |doi=10.2307/2144459 |jstor=2144459 }}</ref> British authorities refused to approve the annexation following the German annexation of [[German New Guinea|New Guinea]] in 1884, but four years later it established a protectorate over Papua as [[Territory of Papua|British New Guinea]].

In 1905, the recently federated Australian government passed the [[Papua Act 1905|Papua Act]] which came into effect in 1906. The act transferred Papua, with Port Moresby as its capital, to direct Australian rule. From then until 1941 Port Moresby grew slowly. The main growth was on the peninsula, where port facilities and other services were gradually improved.

===World War II===

During [[World War II]], some Papuan men enlisted in the [[Royal Pacific Islands Regiment|Papua Infantry Battalion]] and others as carriers over trails and rough terrains ([[Porter (carrier)|porter]]s) as supply support to [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] and [[Japan]]ese armies during long jungle marches.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://e-journal.iain-palangkaraya.ac.id/files/journals/9/articles/5183/submission/original/5183-15633-2-SM.html|title=Australian War Memorial - AJRP Essays|publisher=Ajrp.awm.gov.au|access-date=2010-04-25|archive-date=4 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180804222129/http://rockinrebel.com/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Historian [[William Manchester]] outlines in his biography of General [[Douglas MacArthur]], ''[[American Caesar]]'', that acting as porters was well down the natives' list of acceptable voluntary activities and that they would fade away without great inducements.<ref name="Caesar0">[[American Caesar]], [[William Manchester]], 1978, Little Brown Company, 793 pages, {{ISBN|0-316-54498-1}}, pp.306: "On and about Jul-Sep 1942 and MacArthur's troops stop the Japanese in the difficult jungles of New Guinea and General Kenney gifts Port Moresby to the SAC by moving the bomber line {{convert|1800|mi|km|disp=sqbr}} to five new air bases."</ref> Many Papuan residents of Port Moresby either returned to their family villages or were evacuated to camps when the threat of Japanese invasion loomed.

In 1945, the [[Territory of Papua and New Guinea]] was formed when [[Territory of Papua|Papua]] and the former German New Guinea, which had been administered by Australia since 1918, were amalgamated under a single Australian administration though several laws remained in two territories and remain so, which can be complicating with provinces sitting on two sides of the otherwise extinct boundary. Port Moresby became the capital of the new combined territory and a focal point for the expansion of public services. Port Moresby was granted city status in 1972, with [[Oala Oala-Rarua]] becoming the first Lord Mayor.<ref>[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/250270589 Our first city] ''Papua New Guinea Post-Courier'', 14 April 1972</ref>

===Independence===

In September 1975, Papua New Guinea became an independent country with Port Moresby as its capital city. Prince [[Charles III|Charles, Prince of Wales]], represented the [[Monarchy of Papua New Guinea|Queen of Papua New Guinea]] at the celebrations.<ref name=TelegraphPoW>{{citation| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/prince-charles/9552611/Prince-of-Wales-and-Duchess-of-Cornwall-to-make-Australian-visit.html| title=Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall to make Australian visit| date=19 September 2012| newspaper=The Telegraph| access-date=21 September 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921114200/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/prince-charles/9552611/Prince-of-Wales-and-Duchess-of-Cornwall-to-make-Australian-visit.html| archive-date=21 September 2012| url-status=live}}</ref> New government, intellectual and cultural buildings were constructed in the suburb of [[Waigani]] to supplement and replace those of downtown Port Moresby. They included those for government departments, including a National Parliament Building, which was opened in 1984 by Prince Charles and blends traditional design with modern building technology.<ref name=TelegraphPoW/>

[[File:Site of POM downtown UC being redeveloped.jpg|thumb|left|The longstanding downtown United Church with next door office building in 2013 were replaced with one building, the church on the ground floor.]]

The [[Papua New Guinea National Museum and Art Gallery|Papua New Guinea National Museum]] and National Library are in [[Waigani]]. A mansion was built in Port Moresby just west of the old legislative building but the last pre-independence chief minister and first prime minister of the sovereign state declared it not nearly grand enough; it was made the residence of Australian high commissioners and a mansion suitable to Somare's demands was built in Waigani.

Several of the government buildings have been abandoned due to long-term neglect. Chief amongst these are Marea Haus (known to most locals as the "Pineapple Building") and the Central Government Offices.{{cn|date=April 2023}} However, widespread restoration rather than demolition of long-disused office buildings has been highly active since the first decade of the 21st century.{{cn|date=April 2023}} The legislative building before independence and the first parliament building is long-gone but the old court house in town Port Moresby remains, bearing its pre-independence label with its previous title.

The population of the Port Moresby area expanded rapidly after independence. In 1980, the census return registered a population of 120,000; by 1990, this had increased to 195,000.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://pcabii.org/resources/provinces/Port%20Moresby.pdf |title=''pcabii.org'' |access-date=2017-08-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803055354/http://pcabii.org/resources/provinces/Port%20Moresby.pdf |archive-date=2017-08-03 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Climate==
Moresby has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Aw'') with relatively constant temperatures throughout the year. Port Moresby's average yearly rainfall is {{convert|898.8|mm|2|disp=or}}, making it the driest place in New Guinea.

The [[wet season]] starts in December and ends in May; the [[dry season]] covers the remaining six months. This is due to the south easterly [[trade wind]]s running parallel to the coast, and the city being surrounded by high mountains. The average high temperatures range from {{convert|28|to|32|C|F|1}} depending on time of year, while the average low temperature shows very little seasonal variation, hovering around the {{convert|23|°C|1}} mark. It tends to be slightly cooler in the city during the dry season.

The National Capital District machinery of government also incorporates the [[Motu Koita Assembly]], established by an act of parliament to represent the traditional landowners of Port Moresby, the Motu and Koitabu people. The Assembly governs the traditional lands and inhabitants of the ten recognised villages, and is the only entity of its kind in Papua New Guinea. The Chair of the Motu Koita Assembly also holds the position of Deputy Governor of the National Capital District.{{cn|date=July 2023}} 

Port Moresby refers to both the urbanised area of the National Capital District and more specifically to the main business area, known locally as "Town".{{cn|date=July 2023}} 

Since the 1990s the original town centre has ceased to have restaurants and night life, though it is very successful and prosperous-looking as an office centre.

==Transport==
[[File:Port Moresby Airport looking west.jpg|thumb|[[Jacksons International Airport]], looking east across the airstrip.]]
Port Moresby is served within the city by buses and privately owned taxis. Flights are vital for transport about the country, highways not being widely available. Port Moresby is served by [[Jacksons International Airport]], the biggest international airport and [[Papua New Guinea Defence Force]] Air Wing base in the country.

As the national highway system is not fully linked, there are many internal flights to other towns, such as [[Lae]] and [[Madang]], which have no direct road connection to Port Moresby.

Papua New Guinea is rich in natural resources, which account for two thirds of its export earnings. Though PNG is filled with resources, the lack of development led foreign countries to take over some sites. Continuing foreign demand for PNG's resources led the United States to set up an oil company that began to export in 2004. This was the largest project in PNG's history. The project increased the potential to triple PNG's export revenue. Papua New Guinea gained much assistance from Australia and was offered two hundred million dollars a year in aid, and many countries such as Singapore, Japan and China have also played a great part in PNG's industry business.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/papua-new-guinea/|title=The World Factbook|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2016-03-14}}</ref> The decision to host the 2018 [[APEC]] meeting,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.apecpng2018.org/|title=APECPNG2018.ORG|website=www.apecpng2018.org|access-date=2016-08-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709114755/http://apecpng2018.org/|archive-date=2016-07-09|url-status=live}}</ref> brought a large number of world leaders to Port Moresby.
