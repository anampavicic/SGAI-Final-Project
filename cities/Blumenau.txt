'''Blumenau''' ({{IPA|pt-BR|blumeˈnaw|lang}}) is a city in [[Vale do Itajaí]], [[Santa Catarina (Brazil)|Santa Catarina]] state, in the [[South Region, Brazil|South Region]] of [[Brazil]], {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the state capital [[Florianópolis]].

The city was founded by the German [[chemist]] and [[pharmacist]] [[Hermann Blumenau]] (1819–1899), who arrived on a boat via the [[Itajaí-Açu River]] accompanied by seventeen other Germans, and still celebrates its German heritage, including the [[Oktoberfest of Blumenau|second largest Oktoberfest]] in the world.

== History ==

The city was founded September 2, 1850, by [[Hermann Blumenau|Hermann Bruno Otto Blumenau]] and seventeen other [[German Brazilian|German]] [[immigrants]]. Later arrivals include biologist and early proponent of [[Darwinian Evolution]], [[Fritz Müller]].

The history of Blumenau is the result of the arrival of German immigrants who settled these fertile areas of the [[Atlantic Forest]]. Having an interest in the problems faced by European immigrants, in 1845 Hermann Blumenau reached an agreement with the [[Society for the Protection of German Emigrants]] to represent it and traveled to Brazil, aiming to create new German settlements and to check the situation of those that already existed. He traveled to [[Rio Grande do Sul]], and then to [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], where he visited the German colony of [[São Pedro de Alcântara, Santa Catarina|São Pedro de Alcântara]]. Aware of comments about the [[Vale do Itajaí|Itajaí Valley]], he explored it in detail, in association with his compatriot [[:pt:Ferdinand Hackradt|Ferdinand Hackradt]], since the aforementioned society was dissolved.<ref name=":0">{{Harvnb|el-Khatib|1970|pp=19–20}}</ref>

After taking certain precautions, Hermann Blumenau headed for Germany, to seek immigrants. On September 2, 1850, Hermann Blumenau returned to the chosen area with the seventeen initial immigrants. Despite the floods, clashes with wild animals and even with the [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous peoples]], due to the work of German immigrants willing to migrate continuously in greater numbers, the settlement prospered. Those first immigrants had a great support from the Brazilian government, who gave them land, housing, livestock, seeds, education and healthcare for a very low price and in many cases, entirely free.<ref name=":0" />

On February 4, 1880, the [[Municipality (Brazil)|municipality]] of Blumenau was created, composed of about 13,000 residents.<ref name=":0" />

On April 5, 2023, a daycare in Blumenau became the scene of a [[Blumenau school attack|deadly hatchet attack]] in which a 25-year-old man killed four children and wounded five others before being arrested.

== Geography ==
The city is located in a valley bisected by the [[Itajaí-Açu river|Itajaí-Açu River]], surrounded by hills with forests. The lower areas, including towers and tall buildings in the city center, constantly suffer from the threat of floods. Blumenau's first recorded flood took place in the dawn on September 23, 1880. The worst took place in 1983 and 1984, when the city was completely isolated for weeks.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Today, Blumenau is well-prepared against such threats, but many citizens prefer to live in higher areas spread into the nearby hills and plains to avoid flooding. However, this planning could not avoid even worse [[2008 Santa Catarina floods|flooding]] in late November 2008, that killed over 100 and forced thousands to evacuate.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

=== Climate ===
The climate of Blumenau is considered to be subtropical, a climate of transition between the predominantly tropical climate of Brazil and the predominantly temperate climate of [[Argentina]]. Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], the city has a warm, [[humid subtropical climate]].

Blumenau, like the entire state of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], is located south of the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]; therefore it is mild in the winter with temperatures averaging 16.6&nbsp;°C (61&nbsp;°F) and hot and humid in the summer with high temperatures averaging around 30&nbsp;°C (87&nbsp;°F). On July 23, 2013 the downtown of the city got a snow-rain mix and higher neighborhoods had accumulating snow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clicrbs.com.br/especial/sc/jsc/19,6,4209307,Neve-e-registrada-em-cinco-pontos-de-Blumenau.html|title=Neve é registrada em cinco pontos de Blumenau|work=Jornal de Santa Catarina}}</ref>

== Economy ==
Blumenau's main economic activity is still the [[textile industry]], represented by large manufacturers such as [[Cia. Hering]], Karsten and Teka.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Another area that draws attention is that of [[information technology]]; the city is the headquarters of the so-called [[Brazilian Silicon Valley]], and many software leaders in its segment, some of whom were born in [[Blusoft]] and [[Instituto Gene]] startup incubators. Blumenau is also known as a location for the manufacturing of metallurgic, mechanical, and electrical equipment.

It has a strong economy, boosted by strong trade, service, and tourism events, with exhibitions of international importance, which are generally held in ''Vila Germânica'' (German Villa Park). Additionally, a new but rapidly expanding market is the production of craft [[beer]], such as [[Eisenbahn]].

=== Transport ===
Even though Blumenau is served by [[Blumenau Airport|Quero-quero Airport]], normally passengers use scheduled flights operated from [[Ministro Victor Konder International Airport]], located in the nearby municipality of [[Navegantes]]. [[Gol Transportes Aéreos|Gol Airlines]],<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.voegol.com.br/int/LocalTransport/Paginas/Navegantes.aspx | title=Local Transportation-Navegantes | publisher=Gol Airlines | access-date=27 March 2011 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125195125/http://www.voegol.com.br/int/LocalTransport/Paginas/Navegantes.aspx | archive-date=25 January 2011 }}</ref> [[Azul Brazilian Airlines]],<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.voeazul.com.br/aspx/servicoOnibusBlumenau.aspx | title=Ônibus Executivo/Blumenau-Aeroporto de Navegantes | publisher=Azul Brazilian Airlines | language=pt | access-date=27 March 2011 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322115911/http://www.voeazul.com.br/aspx/servicoOnibusBlumenau.aspx | archive-date=22 March 2011 }}</ref> and Latam offer for its passengers bus transfers between Navegantes and Blumenau at regular times.
During Oktoberfest, Azul operates flights at the local airport.

=== Tourism ===
The Blumenau's Tourism Department maintains four tour routes covering different aspects of the city. Besides these, there's the festival of the municipality. Also, the [[Oktoberfest of Blumenau]], held every October, attracts over a million tourists every year. Originally begun as a fundraiser to alleviate the devastating floods of 1983 and 1984, the Blumenau Oktoberfest has become the second largest Oktoberfest after Munich.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ORF-Radiothek |url=https://oe1.orf.at/player/20240923/769628/1727108700000 |access-date=2024-09-24 |website=oe1.orf.at}}</ref>
