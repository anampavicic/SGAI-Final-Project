== History ==
[[File:Ndjamena 1952.jpg|thumb|A street in N'Djamena, 1952]]

N'Djamena (from the Arabic name for the village of Nijamina, "the city where one finds rest") was founded as '''Fort-Lamy''' by French commander [[Émile Gentil]] on 29 May 1900, and named after [[Amédée-François Lamy]], an army officer who had been killed in the [[Battle of Kousséri]] about a month earlier.<ref>Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 208</ref><ref name="inpictures">{{cite book |title=Chad in Pictures |first=Christine |last=Zurocha-Walske |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kkB1GaR2SXEC&pg=PT19 |page=17 |isbn=978-1-57505-956-3 |publisher=Twenty-First Century Books |access-date=2015-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430061439/https://books.google.com/books?id=kkB1GaR2SXEC&pg=PT19 |archive-date=2016-04-30 |url-status=live}}</ref> It was a major trading city and became the capital of the region and nation.

Fort-Lamy received its first bank branch in 1950, when the [[Bank of West Africa (BAO)]] opened a branch there.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

On 6 April 1973, [[Heads of state of Chad|President]] [[François Tombalbaye]]<ref name="inpictures"/> changed its name to N'Djamena (taken from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name of a nearby village, ''Niǧāmīnā'', meaning "place of rest") as part of his ''[[Authenticité (Chad)|authenticité]]'' program of [[Africanization]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Rice |first=Eleanor |date=3 Feb 1974 |title=Nationalism, Drought Make the News in Chad |language=en |pages=91 |work=[[Arizona Daily Star]] |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/166479676 |url-access=subscription |access-date=31 May 2023}}</ref> The city was occupied by [[Libya]] during the 1980–81 Libyan intervention as part of the [[Chadian–Libyan conflict]],<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|title=N'Djamena (Chad)|year=2009|url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/407350/NDjamena|access-date=29 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325015200/https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/407350/NDjamena|archive-date=25 March 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> and the associated [[Transitional Government of National Unity (Chad)|Transitional Government of National Unity]].<ref>{{Country study |country=Chad |abbr=td |section=Civil War and Multilateral Mediation, 1979–82 |author=Collelo, Thomas |editor= |date=December 1988 |pd=no}}</ref>

The city was partly destroyed during the [[Transitional Government of National Unity (Chad)|Chadian Civil War]], in 1979 and again in 1980. In these years, almost all of the population fled the town, searching for refuge on the opposite bank of the [[Chari River]] in Cameroon, next to the city of [[Kousséri]]. The residents did not return until 1981–82, after the end of the clashes. Until 1984, facilities and services were subject to strict rationing, and schools remained closed.<ref>Samuel Decalo, ''Historical Dictionary of Chad'', Scarecrow, 1987, pp. 229–230</ref>

The period of turmoil in the city was started by the abortive coup attempted by the northerner Prime Minister [[Hissène Habré]] against the southerner President [[Félix Malloum]]: while Malloum and the national army loyal to him were defeated, the intervention in the battle of other northern factions rival to that of Habré complicated the situation. A temporary truce was reached in 1979 through international mediation, establishing the warlord [[Goukouni Oueddei]] as head of a government of national unity with his rival Habré as Defense Minister. The intense rivalry between Goukouni and Habré caused the eruption of new clashes in the city in 1980; N'Djamena found itself divided into sectors controlled by the various warlords. The tug-of-war reached a conclusion after many months only when Goukouni asked for the intervention of the Libyans, whose tanks overwhelmed Habré's defenses in the capital.<ref>Robert Buijtenhuijs, ''Le Frolinat et les guerres civiles du Tchad'', Karthala, 1987, pp. 67–175</ref>

Following differences between Goukouni and [[Muammar Gaddafi]] and international disapproval of Libyan intervention, the Libyan troops left the capital and Chad in 1981. This opened the door to Habré, who marched on N'Djamena, occupying the city with little resistance in 1982 and installing himself as the new president.<ref>R. Buijtenhuijs, ''Le Frolinat et les guerres civiles du Tchad'', pp. 177–225</ref> He was eventually dislodged in a similar fashion in 1990 by a former general of his, [[Idriss Déby]].{{citation needed|date = May 2013}}

The city had only 9,976 inhabitants in 1937, but a decade later, in 1947, the population had almost doubled to 18,435. In 1968, after independence, the population reached 126,483. In 1993, it surpassed half a million with 529,555. A good deal of this growth has been due to refugees fleeing into N'Djamena for security, although many people fled N'Djamena, also depending on the political situation.<ref name="encyclo"/> The city surpassed the million mark in population by the early 2010s.

On 13 April 2006, a rebel [[United Front for Democratic Change]] attack on the city was defeated<ref>{{Cite news |date=2006-04-14 |title=UN condemns rebel attack in Chad |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4908836.stm |url-status=live |access-date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209213918/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4908836.stm |archive-date=2008-02-09}}</ref> in the [[Battle of N'Djamena (2006)|Battle of N'Djamena]].

== Geography ==
N'Djamena is located at {{Coord|12|06|36|N|15|03|00|E|type:city|display=inline}}, on the [[confluence]] of the [[Chari River|Chari]] and [[Logone River|Logone]] rivers.<ref name="encyclo"/>

While primarily an administrative centre, the city includes the [[Nassara Strip]] [[central business district|commercial centre]] and residential areas, such as [[Mbololo]], [[Chagoua]], [[Paris Congo]] and [[Moursal]]. The main commercial avenue of the city is the [[Avenue Charles de Gaulle]].

== Environment ==
N'Djamena is Africa's most polluted city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=World's most polluted cities (historical data 2017-2021) |url=https://www.iqair.com/world-most-polluted-cities |access-date= |website=www.iqair.com}}</ref>

==Climate==
N'Djamena has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSh'') with a short [[wet season]] and a lengthy [[dry season]]. Despite the fact that the city receives on average approximately {{convert|510|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rainfall annually, due to the area's very high [[evapotranspiration]], N'Djamena still falls into the semi-arid climate category. The wet season lasts from June to September, with the heaviest rain occurring in August. The dry season essentially covers the remaining eight months. Based on annual temperatures, N'Djamena is one of the hottest major cities on the planet. In only one month of the year (August) do average monthly high temperatures fail to cross the {{convert|32|°C|0|abbr=on}} mark. The city's highest temperatures are usually seen between March and May, just before the onset of the heavier rains.

== Economy ==
[[File:NDjamena, Chad.jpg|thumb|N’Djamena seen from the [[International Space Station]] in 2010]]
N'Djamena's primary economic source is agricultural work. About 80% of the population within N'Djamena works within farming-based industries, including cultivation of crops and growing [[livestock]]. The economy in N'Djamena is therefore almost totally reliant on good weather, making the economy struggle in years with low rainfall. N'Djamena receives financial aid from the [[World Bank]], as well as the [[African Development Bank]]. There is a high demand for skilled laborers within N'Djamena to work for oil and gas sectors, as well as laborers for foreign [[non-governmental organization]]s, [[Health care|medical services]], and English teaching. Residents of N'Djamena are liable to pay tax up to a maximum amount of 60% of all net income.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.internations.org/ndjamena-expats/guide/working-in-n-djamena-18496|title=Working in N'Djamena|website=InterNations|access-date=2016-11-12|archive-date=2016-11-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114170043/https://www.internations.org/ndjamena-expats/guide/working-in-n-djamena-18496|url-status=dead}}</ref>
