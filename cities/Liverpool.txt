Established as a borough in [[Lancashire]] in 1207, Liverpool became a significant town in the late 17th century, when the port at nearby [[Chester]] began to silt up. The [[Port of Liverpool]] became heavily involved in the [[Atlantic slave trade]], with the first [[slave ship]] departing from the town in 1699. The port also imported much of the cotton required by the neighbouring [[Textile manufacture during the British Industrial Revolution|Lancashire textile mills]], and became a major departure point for English and Irish emigrants to North America. Liverpool rose to global economic importance at the forefront of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th century and was home to the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway|first intercity railway]], the first non-combustible warehouse system (the [[Royal Albert Dock, Liverpool|Royal Albert Dock]]), and a pioneering [[Liverpool Overhead Railway|elevated electrical railway]]; it was granted city status in 1880 and was moved from Lancashire to the newly created county of Merseyside [[Local Government Act 1972|in 1974]]. Like many other British cities, it entered a period of decline in the mid-20th century; however, it has experienced significant and ongoing regeneration since the [[European Union]] selected it as the [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2008,{{efn|Shared with [[Stavanger]] in Norway.}} which was reported to have generated over £800 million for the local economy within a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/culture/pdf/doc1155_en.pdf|title=Report on the Nominations from the UK and Norway for the European Capital of Culture 2008|access-date=11 July 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819212038/http://ec.europa.eu/culture/pdf/doc1155_en.pdf|archive-date=19 August 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=6 April 2018|title=Liverpool, European Capital of Culture: 2008 – 2018|url=https://www.financedigest.com/liverpool-european-capital-of-culture-2008-2018.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220527130901/https://www.financedigest.com/liverpool-european-capital-of-culture-2008-2018.html|archive-date=27 May 2022}}</ref>

Residents of Liverpool are often called "Scousers" in reference to [[Scouse (food)|scouse]], a local stew made popular by sailors in the city, while "Scouse" is also the most common name given to the [[Scouse|distinctive local accent]].

==Toponymy==
The name comes from the [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|lifer}}, meaning thick or muddy water, and {{lang|ang|pōl}}, meaning a pool or creek, and is first recorded around 1190 as ''Liuerpul''.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Hanks, Patrick|author2=Hodges, Flavia|author3=Mills, David|author4=Room, Adrian|title=The Oxford Names Companion|date=2002|location=Oxford|publisher=The University Press|isbn=978-0198605614|page=1110}}</ref><ref name=DH>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Liverpool|dictionary=The Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=Liverpool|last=Harper|first=Douglas|access-date=15 September 2017|archive-date=10 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210110031823/https://www.etymonline.com/word/Liverpool|url-status=live}}</ref> According to the ''Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names'', "The original reference was to a pool or tidal creek now filled up into which two streams drained".<ref>''The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names'', ed. by Victor Watts (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), s.v.

Although the Old English origin of the name Liverpool is beyond dispute, claims are sometimes made that the name Liverpool is of Welsh origin, but these are without foundation. The Welsh name for Liverpool is {{lang|cy|Lerpwl}}, from a former English local form Leerpool. This is a reduction of the form "Leverpool" with the loss of the intervocalic [v] (seen in other English names and words e.g. Daventry (Northamptonshire) > Danetry, never-do-well > ne’er-do-well).

In the 19th century, some Welsh publications used the name "{{lang|cy|Lle'r Pwll}}" ("(the) place (of) the pool"), a reinterpretation of {{lang|cy|Lerpwl}}, probably in the belief that "{{lang|cy|Lle'r Pwll}}" was the original form.

Another name, which is widely known even today, is {{lang|cy|[[Welsh exonyms|Llynlleifiad]]}}, again a 19th-century coining. "{{lang|cy|Llyn}}" is pool, but "{{lang|cy|lleifiad}}" has no obvious meaning. G. Melville Richards (1910–1973), a pioneer of scientific toponymy in Wales, in "Place Names of North Wales",<ref name="Place-Names of North Wales">{{cite book|chapter=Place-Names of North Wales|first=G. Melville|last=Richards|date=1953|title=A Scientific Survey of Merseyside|pages=242–250|publisher=British Association}}</ref> does not attempt to explain it beyond noting that "{{lang|cy|lleifiad}}" is used as a Welsh equivalent of "Liver".

A derivative form of a learned borrowing into Welsh ({{lang|cy|*llaf}}) of Latin {{lang|la|lāma}} (slough, bog, fen) to give "{{lang|cy|lleifiad}}" is possible, but unproven.

===Early history===

In the [[Middle Ages]], Liverpool existed firstly as farmland within the [[West Derby Hundred]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Victoria history of the county of Lancaster. Edited by William Farrer and J. Brownbill|url=https://archive.org/stream/victoriahistoryo04farruoft/victoriahistoryo04farruoft_djvu.txt?referer=www.clickfind.com.au|access-date=8 October 2023|website=clickfind.com.au}}</ref> before growing in to a small town of farmers, fishermen and tradesmen and tactical army base for [[John of England|King John of England]]. The town was planned with its own [[Liverpool Castle|castle]], although due to outbreaks of disease and its subordinance to the nearby [[Deva Victrix|Roman port of Chester]], the town's growth and prosperity stagnated until the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Substantial growth took place in the mid-late 18th century when the town became the most heavily involved European port in the [[Atlantic slave trade]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=European traders|url=https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/history-of-slavery/europe|website=liverpoolmuseums.org.uk|access-date=23 September 2023|archive-date=19 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619190054/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ism/slavery/europe/index.aspx|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[John of England|King John]]'s [[letters patent]] of 1207 announced the foundation of the borough of Liverpool (then spelt as ''Liuerpul''). There is no evidence that the place had previously been a centre of any trade.

The 19th century saw Liverpool rise to global economic importance. Pioneering, [[History of Liverpool|world first]], technology and civic facilities launched in the city to serve the accelerating population which was fuelled by an influx of ethnic and religious communities from all around the world.

By the start of the 19th century, a large volume of trade was passing through Liverpool, and the construction of major buildings reflected this wealth. In 1830, Liverpool and [[Manchester]] became the first cities to have an intercity rail link, through the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]]. The population continued to rise rapidly, especially during the 1840s when [[Irish diaspora|Irish]] migrants began arriving by the hundreds of thousands as a result of the [[Irish Potato Famine (1845–1849)|Great Famine]]. While many Irish settled during this time in the city, a large percentage also emigrated to the United States or moved to the industrial centres of [[Lancashire]], Yorkshire and the [[Midlands]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Irish cultural expression in Liverpool|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/immig_emig/england/liverpool/article_1.shtml|access-date=20 September 2023|publisher=BBC|archive-date=13 August 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230813020309/https://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/immig_emig/england/liverpool/article_1.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref>{{wikisource|Letitia Elizabeth Landon (L.

Britain was a major market for cotton imported from the [[Deep South]] of the United States, which fed the [[Textile manufacture during the British Industrial Revolution|textile industry]] in the country.

In the early 19th century, Liverpool played a major role in the [[Antarctic]] [[seal hunting|sealing]] industry, in recognition of which [[Liverpool Beach]] in the [[South Shetland Islands]] is named after the city.<ref>[http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=137191 Liverpool Beach.] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425164150/http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=137191 |date=25 April 2012 }} [[Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica|SCAR Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica]].</ref>

As early as 1851, the city was described as "the New York of Europe".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Bankers' Magazine|publisher=Groombridge & Sons|location=London|series=v.11|year=1851|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nC05AAAAMAAJ&q=new-york-of-europe&pg=PA783}}</ref> During the late 19th and early 20th century, Liverpool was attracting immigrants from across Europe. This resulted in the construction of a diverse array of religious buildings in the city for the new ethnic and religious groups, many of which are still in use today. The [[German Church, Liverpool|Deutsche Kirche Liverpool]], [[Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas]], [[Gustav Adolf Church, Liverpool|Gustav Adolf Church]] and [[Princes Road Synagogue]] were all established in the 1800s to serve Liverpool's growing German, Greek, Nordic and Jewish communities, respectively. One of Liverpool's oldest surviving churches, [[St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, Liverpool|St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church]], served the [[Poles in the United Kingdom|Polish community]] in its final years as a place of worship.

===20th century===
[[File:Liverpool, 1946.png|thumb|left|Liverpool's Lime Street area pictured from above in 1946]]
The 20th century saw Liverpool's established rank as a global economic powerhouse challenged. Its strategic location as an international seaport made it particularly vulnerable in two [[World war]]s. [[Economic depression]]s (both in the United Kingdom and across the world), changing [[Housing in the United Kingdom|housing patterns]] and [[Containerization|containerisation]] in the maritime industry contributed to a downtrend in the city's productivity and prosperity. Despite this, the city's influence on global popular culture excelled and by the end of the century, the continuing process of [[urban renewal]] paved the way for the redefined modern city of the 21st century.

The period after the [[World War I|Great War]] was marked by social unrest, as society grappled with the massive war losses of young men, as well as trying to re-integrate veterans into civilian life and the economy. Unemployment and poor living standards greeted many ex-servicemen. [[Trade unions in the United Kingdom|Union organising]] and [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|strikes]] took place in numerous locations, including a [[British police strikes in 1918 and 1919|police strike in Liverpool]] among the [[Merseyside Police|City Police]]. Numerous [[British Empire|colonial soldiers]] and sailors from Africa and India, who had served with the [[British Armed Forces]], settled in Liverpool and other port cities. In June 1919, they were subject to attack by whites in racial riots; residents in the port included [[Swedes in the United Kingdom|Swedish immigrants]], and both groups had to compete with native people from Liverpool for jobs and housing. In this period, race riots also took place in other port cities.<ref name=Tabili>[http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/840 Dr Laura Tabili, "Review of Jacqueline Jenkinson, ''Black 1919: Riots, Racism and Resistance in Imperial Britain,'' Liverpool, Liverpool University Press, 2009] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422181418/http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/840 |date=22 April 2016 }}, {{ISBN|9781846312007}}", ''Reviews in History'' website, accessed 13 April 2016</ref>

The [[Housing Act 1919]] resulted in mass council housing being built across Liverpool during the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1920s and 1930s, as much as 15% of the city's population (around 140,000 people) was relocated from the inner-city to new purpose built, lower density suburban housing estates, based on the belief that this would improve their standard of living, though the overall benefits have been contested.<ref>{{Cite news|title=A legacy of the Great Depression|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/liverpool/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8246000/8246344.stm|access-date=20 September 2023|publisher=BBC News|date=10 September 2009|archive-date=2 October 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231002185747/http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/liverpool/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8246000/8246344.stm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Municipal Suburbia in Liverpool, 1919–1939|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40112817|access-date=20 September 2023|journal=The Town Planning Review|jstor=40112817|last1=McKenna|first1=Madeline|date=30 October 1989|volume=60|issue=3|pages=287–318|doi=10.3828/tpr.60.3.4hk5074443483k74|archive-date=8 November 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231108060702/https://www.jstor.org/stable/40112817|url-status=live|issn=0041-0020|url-access=subscription}}</ref> Numerous private homes were also built during this era. During the [[Great Depression]] of the early 1930s, unemployment peaked at around 30% in the city. Liverpool was the site of Britain's first [[Liverpool John Lennon Airport|provincial airport]], operating from 1930.

During the [[Second World War]], the critical strategic importance of Liverpool was recognised by both [[Hitler]] and [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]]. The city was heavily bombed by the Germans, suffering a [[Liverpool Blitz|blitz]] second only to London's.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/exhibitions/blitz/blitz.asp|title=Spirit of the Blitz : Liverpool in the Second World War|publisher=[[Liverpool Museums]]|year=2003|access-date=13 September 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606081949/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/exhibitions/blitz/blitz.asp|archive-date=6 June 2010}}</ref> The pivotal [[Battle of the Atlantic]] was planned, fought and won from Liverpool.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/archive/info-sheet.aspx?sheetId=4|title=Merseyside Maritime Museum, Sheet No. 4: Battle of the Atlantic|publisher=Liverpoolmuseums.org.uk|date=3 September 1939|access-date=4 October 2012|archive-date=3 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220910/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/archive/info-sheet.aspx?sheetId=4|url-status=live}}</ref>

The ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' made 80&nbsp;[[Liverpool Blitz|air raids on Merseyside]], killing 2,500&nbsp;people and causing damage to almost half the homes in the metropolitan area. Significant rebuilding followed the war, including massive housing estates and the [[Seaforth Dock]], the largest dock project in Britain. Since 1952, Liverpool has been twinned with [[Cologne]], Germany, a city which also suffered severe aerial bombing during the war. In the 1950s and 1960s, much of the immediate reconstruction that took place in the city centre proved to be deeply unpopular. The historic portions of the city that had survived German bombing suffered extensive destruction during urban renewal. It has been argued that the so-called "Shankland Plan" of the 1960s, named after the town planner [[Graeme Shankland]], led to compromised town planning and vast road-building schemes that devastated and divided inner city neighbourhoods. Concrete [[brutalist architecture]], compromised visions, botched projects and grand designs that were never realised became the subject of condemnation. Historian [[Raphael Samuel]] labelled Graeme Shankland "the butcher of Liverpool".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Unbuilt Liverpool: the city that might have been|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jul/04/unbuilt-liverpool-city-might-have-been-in-pictures|access-date=20 September 2023|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 July 2017|last1=Dunmall|first1=Giovanna}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Graeme Shankland: a Sixties Architect-Planner and the Political Culture of the British Left|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/architectural-history/article/graeme-shankland-a-sixties-architectplanner-and-the-political-culture-of-the-british-left/63B1F4114E777DE29569BCF5035952B2|access-date=20 September 2023|journal=Architectural History|date=2014|doi=10.1017/S0066622X00001477|last1=Smith|first1=Otto Saumarez|volume=57|pages=393–422|archive-date=2 October 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231002185745/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/architectural-history/article/graeme-shankland-a-sixties-architectplanner-and-the-political-culture-of-the-british-left/63B1F4114E777DE29569BCF5035952B2|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Walkways in the Sky and the Liverpool 'masterplan' that was never built|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/business/gallery/walkways-sky-liverpool-masterplan-never-15874583|access-date=20 September 2023|website=liverpoolecho.co.uk|date=20 June 2020|archive-date=2 October 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231002185747/https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/business/gallery/walkways-sky-liverpool-masterplan-never-15874583|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The Liverpool City Plan|url=https://www.udg.org.uk/publications/articles/liverpool-city-plan|access-date=20 September 2023|website=udg.org.uk|date=April 2020|archive-date=2 October 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231002185746/https://www.udg.org.uk/publications/articles/liverpool-city-plan|url-status=live}}</ref>

A significant [[West Indies|West Indian]] black community has existed in the city since the first two decades of the 20th century. Like most British cities and industrialised towns, Liverpool became home to a significant number of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] immigrants, beginning after World War I with colonial soldiers and sailors who had served in the area. More immigrants arrived after World War II, mostly settling in older inner-city areas such as [[Toxteth]], where housing was less expensive. The black population of Liverpool was recorded at 1.90% in 2011. In the [[2021 United Kingdom census|2021 Census]], 5.2% described themselves as black African, Caribbean, mixed white and black African, mixed white and Caribbean or 'other black'.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ethnicity – Census 2021|url=https://liverpool.gov.uk/council/key-statistics-and-data/census-2021/ethnicity|access-date=29 September 2023|website=liverpool.gov.uk|archive-date=18 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230918184737/https://liverpool.gov.uk/council/key-statistics-and-data/census-2021/ethnicity|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The ethnic population of England and Wales broken down by local authority|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/may/18/ethnic-population-england-wales|url-status=live|website=The Guardian|date=18 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210723001845/https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/may/18/ethnic-population-england-wales|archive-date=23 July 2021}}</ref>

In the 1960s, Liverpool was the centre of the "[[Beat music|Merseybeat]]" sound, which became synonymous with [[the Beatles]] and fellow Liverpudlian rock bands. Influenced by American rhythm and blues and rock music, they also in turn strongly affected American music. The [[Beatles]] became internationally known in the early 1960s and performed [[List of the Beatles' live performances|around the world together]]; they were, and continue to be, the most commercially successful and musically influential band in popular history. Their co-founder, singer, and composer [[John Lennon]] was killed in New York City in 1980.

Previously part of Lancashire, and a county borough from 1889, Liverpool became a [[metropolitan borough]] within the newly created metropolitan county of [[Merseyside]], in 1974. From the mid-1970s onwards, Liverpool's docks and traditional [[manufacturing industries]] declined due to restructuring of shipping and heavy industry, causing massive losses of jobs. The advent of [[containerisation]] meant that the city's docks became largely obsolete, and dock workers were made unemployed. By the early 1980s, unemployment rates in Liverpool were among the highest in the UK,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/liverpool.html|title=A History of Liverpool|publisher=Localhistories.org|access-date=13 December 2011|archive-date=9 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210509140259/http://www.localhistories.org/liverpool.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> standing at 17% by January 1982 although, this was about half the level of unemployment that had affected the city during the Great Depression some 50 years previously.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gJJVAAAAIBAJ&pg=1176,3408501&dq=liverpool+million+unemployment&hl=en|title=Number of people unemployed at three-million mark in Britain|work=The Leader-Post ([[Google News Archive]])|date=28 January 1982|access-date=21 November 2015|archive-date=9 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210509220751/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gJJVAAAAIBAJ&pg=1176,3408501&dq=liverpool+million+unemployment&hl=en|url-status=live}}</ref> During this period, Liverpool became a hub of fierce left-wing opposition to the central government in London.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29953611|title=The English city that wanted to 'break away' from the UK|publisher=BBC News|date=8 November 2014|access-date=17 June 2022|archive-date=11 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111000034/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29953611|url-status=live}}</ref> Liverpool in the 1980s has been labelled as Britain's 'shock city'.

In the late 20th century, Liverpool's economy began to recover. The late 1980s saw the opening of a regenerated [[Royal Albert Dock, Liverpool|Albert Dock]] which proved to be a catalyst for further regeneration.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Regeneration|url=https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/royal-albert-dock-liverpool/regeneration|access-date=20 September 2023|website=liverpoolmuseums.org.uk|archive-date=2 October 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231002185747/https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/royal-albert-dock-liverpool/regeneration|url-status=live}}</ref> In the mid-1990s, the city enjoyed growth rates higher than the national average. At the end of the 20th century, Liverpool was concentrating on regeneration, a process that continues today.

===21st century===
[[File:Liverpool Cruise Terminal (2023).jpg|thumb|left |The [[Liverpool Cruise Terminal]] and surrounding office and residential developments, part of the [[Liverpool Waters]] megaproject]]
Ongoing regeneration combined with the hosting of internationally significant events has helped to re-purpose Liverpool as one of the most visited, tourist orientated, cities in the United Kingdom. City leaders are focussing on long-term strategies to grow the city's population and economy, while national government explores the continuous potential for devolution in the city.

In 2002, Queen [[Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] visited Liverpool to mark the [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Golden Jubilee]]. On speaking to an audience at [[Liverpool Town Hall]], the Queen recognised Liverpool as "one of the most distinctive and energetic parts of the United Kingdom", and paid tribute to the city's "major orchestras, world-class museums and galleries". She also acknowledged Liverpool's bid to become the [[European Capital of Culture]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Golden Jubilee visit to Liverpool, 25 July 2002|url=https://www.royal.uk/golden-jubilee-visit-liverpool-25-july-2002|access-date=21 September 2023|website=royal.uk|archive-date=7 November 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231107220701/https://www.royal.uk/golden-jubilee-visit-liverpool-25-july-2002|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The life of Queen Elizabeth II – a timeline in Liverpool|url=https://liverpoolexpress.co.uk/the-life-of-queen-elizabeth-ii-a-timeline-in-liverpool|access-date=21 September 2023|website=liverpoolexpress.co.uk|date=9 September 2022|archive-date=2 October 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231002185748/https://liverpoolexpress.co.uk/the-life-of-queen-elizabeth-ii-a-timeline-in-liverpool/|url-status=live}}</ref> To celebrate the [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II]] in 2002, the conservation charity [[Plantlife]] organised a competition to choose [[county flower]]s; the [[Eryngium maritimum|sea-holly]] was Liverpool's final choice.

Capitalising on the popularity of 1960s rock groups, such as [[the Beatles]], as well as the city's world-class art galleries, museums and landmarks, tourism and culture have become a significant factor in Liverpool's economy.
[[File:Modern waterfront developments in Liverpool.jpg|thumb|Modern developments on the Liverpool Waterfront]]
In 2004, property developer [[Grosvenor Group|Grosvenor]] started the [[Liverpool One|Paradise Project]], a £920&nbsp;million development based on [[Paradise Street, Liverpool|Paradise Street]]. This produced one of the most significant changes to Liverpool's city centre since the post-war reconstruction. Renamed as '[[Liverpool One]],' the centre opened in May 2008.

In 2007, events and celebrations took place in honour of the 800th anniversary of the founding of the borough of Liverpool. Liverpool was designated as a joint [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2008. The celebrations included the erection of [[La Princesse]], a large mechanical spider 20 metres high and weighing 37 tonnes, which represented the "eight legs" of Liverpool: honour, history, music, the Mersey, the ports, governance, sunshine and culture. [[La Princesse]] roamed the streets of the city during the festivities, and concluded by entering the [[Queensway Tunnel]].

Spearheaded by the multi-billion-[[Pound sterling|pound]] Liverpool ONE development, regeneration continued throughout the 2010s. Some of the most significant redevelopment projects included new buildings in the [[Liverpool City Centre#Commercial District|Commercial District]], [[King's Dock, Port of Liverpool|King's Dock]], [[Mann Island]], around [[Lime Street, Liverpool|Lime Street]], the [[Baltic Triangle]], [[RopeWalks, Liverpool|RopeWalks]], and [[Edge Lane]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=20 things that shaped Liverpool in the 2010's|url=https://theguideliverpool.com/20-things-that-shaped-liverpool-in-the-2010s|access-date=23 September 2023|website=theguideliverpool.com|archive-date=2 October 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231002175430/https://theguideliverpool.com/20-things-that-shaped-liverpool-in-the-2010s/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Lime Street|url=https://www.murraywood.com/lime-street|access-date=23 September 2023|website=murraywood.com|date=22 July 2022|archive-date=2 October 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231002185751/https://www.murraywood.com/lime-street/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Raves, craft ale and the 'abandoned' square that shaped modern Liverpool|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/raves-craft-ale-abandoned-square-24195648|access-date=23 September 2023|website=liverpoolecho.co.uk|date=11 June 2022|archive-date=2 October 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231002185745/https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/raves-craft-ale-abandoned-square-24195648|url-status=live}}</ref>

Changes to Liverpool's governance took place in 2014.

By the 2020s, urban regeneration throughout the city continues. [[Liverpool Waters]], a mixed-use development in the city's disused northern docklands, has been identified as one of the largest megaprojects in the UK's history.

For the purposes of [[Local government in England|local government]], the city of Liverpool is classified as a [[metropolitan borough]]. The metropolitan borough is located within both the county of [[Merseyside]] and the [[Liverpool City Region]]. Each of these geographical areas is treated as an administrative area with different levels of local governance applying to each.

[[Liverpool City Council]] is the governing body solely for the metropolitan borough of the city of Liverpool and performs functions that are standard of an English [[Unitary Authority]]. 
The [[Liverpool City Region Combined Authority]] and the [[Mayor of the Liverpool City Region]] reserve major strategic powers over such things as transport, economic development and regeneration for the city along with the 5 surrounding boroughs of the Liverpool City Region. The Combined Authority has competency over areas which have been devolved by national government and are specific to the city region.<ref>{{cite web|title=Liverpool devolution deal|date=16 March 2016|publisher=Gov.uk|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/liverpool-devolution-deal|access-date=18 June 2021|archive-date=16 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210516131243/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/liverpool-devolution-deal|url-status=live}}</ref>

Nevertheless, there are a few exceptions to local governance apart from these two structures. Liverpool was administered by [[Merseyside County Council]] between 1974 and 1986 and some residual aspects of organisation which date back to this time have survived. When the County Council was disbanded in 1986, most civic functions were transferred to Liverpool City Council. However, several authorities such as the [[Merseyside Police|police]] and [[Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service|fire and rescue service]], continue to be run at a county-wide level. The county of Merseyside, therefore, continues to exist as an administrative area for a few limited services only, while the capability and capacity of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority is evolving over time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Liverpool City Region explained and how it's different to Merseyside|date=28 December 2020|publisher=Liverpool Echo|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-city-region-explained-how-19427821|access-date=18 June 2021|archive-date=29 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210629015709/https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-city-region-explained-how-19427821|url-status=live}}</ref>

The city also elects five [[member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|members of Parliament]] (MPs) to the [[Westminster Parliament]], all Labour as of the 2024 general election.

Liverpool City Council operates under a constitution comprising 85 city councillors who are directly elected by the Liverpool electorate every 4 years and represent a variety of different [[List of political parties in the United Kingdom|political parties]]. The city councillors make decisions about local services for the city's people.

At each election, the political party that wins the majority of the 85 council seats leads the council for the following 4 years. The local leader of this party assumes the role of Leader of the City Council who then chairs a Cabinet of 9 councillors who are assigned specific responsibilities known as 'portfolios'.

The incumbent Leader of Liverpool City Council is [[Liam Robinson (politician)|Councillor Liam Robinson]], who represents the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], which secured a large majority at the [[2023 Liverpool City Council election|2023 local election]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=New Liverpool Council cabinet named as Labour leader picks new top team to run city|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/new-liverpool-council-cabinet-named-26864485|website=Liverpool Echo|date=7 May 2023|access-date=27 July 2023|archive-date=18 May 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230518041357/https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/new-liverpool-council-cabinet-named-26864485|url-status=live}}</ref>, the Leader is also a member of the Mayor of the Liverpool City Regions cabinet (''Separate from the City Council Cabinet''), at present Robinson holds the portfolio of Cabinet Member for Innovation. 

The City Council's decisions and scrutiny of activities are undertaken by a number of different committees and panels which include the Overview and Scrutiny Committees, Scrutiny Panels, Regulatory Committees and other committees. The day-to-day management of the council is carried out by the management team which includes the Chief Executive and several directors and senior officers. The management team works with the Cabinet and councillors to deliver strategic direction and priorities such as the budget and the City Plan.<ref>{{Cite web|title=How the council works|url=https://liverpool.gov.uk/council/councillors-and-committees/how-the-council-works|website=liverpool.gov.uk|access-date=27 July 2023|archive-date=27 July 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230727105514/https://liverpool.gov.uk/council/councillors-and-committees/how-the-council-works|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The City of Liverpool (Scheme of Elections and Elections of Elected Mayor) Order 2021|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/1089/made|website=legislation.gov.uk|access-date=27 July 2023|archive-date=27 July 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230727105513/https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/1089/made|url-status=live}}</ref>

Throughout most of the 19th and early 20th centuries, Liverpool was a municipal stronghold of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Tory]]ism. However, support for the Conservative Party in recent times has been among the lowest in any part of Britain, particularly since the [[Monetarism|monetarist]] economic policies of former prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. After the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], many have claimed that her victory contributed to longstanding high unemployment and decline in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2008/07/21/the-real-legacy-of-margaret-thatcher-is-a-nation-divided-100252-21375195/|title=The real legacy of Margaret Thatcher is a nation divided|website=Liverpool Echo|date=21 July 2008|access-date=5 August 2011|archive-date=13 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013054916/http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2008/07/21/the-real-legacy-of-margaret-thatcher-is-a-nation-divided-100252-21375195/|url-status=live}}</ref> Liverpool is one of the Labour Party's key strongholds; however, the city has also seen hard times under Labour governments. Particularly in the [[Winter of Discontent]] (late 1978 and early 1979) when Liverpool suffered public sector strikes along with the rest of the United Kingdom, but also when it suffered the particularly humiliating misfortune of having [[Gravedigger|grave-diggers]] going on strike, leaving the dead unburied for long periods.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/3067563.stm|publisher=BBC News|first=Paul|last=Wilenius|title=Enemies within: Thatcher and the unions|date=5 March 2004|access-date=6 May 2011|archive-date=18 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200218003411/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/3067563.stm|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== City Council criticism and improvement ===

In recent years, [[Liverpool City Council]] began an extensive improvement program designed to ensure that the authority makes efficient use of [[taxpayer]]'s money and to encourage more business and investment in the city. [[Grosvenor Group]], the property company responsible for [[Liverpool One]], commended the changes as an "opportunity for bold thinking in liverpool".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Grosvenor hopeful of return to 'bold' thinking in Liverpool|url=https://www.placenorthwest.co.uk/grosvenor-hopeful-of-return-to-bold-thinking-in-liverpool|access-date=8 October 2023|website=placenorthwest.co.uk|date=28 September 2023|archive-date=2 November 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231102184254/https://www.placenorthwest.co.uk/grosvenor-hopeful-of-return-to-bold-thinking-in-liverpool/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2021, a highly critical government inspection and subsequent report of Liverpool City Council (referred to as the Caller report) identified multiple shortcomings at Liverpool City Council. The [[Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government]], [[Robert Jenrick]] sent government [[commissioner]]s to oversee the City Council's highways, regeneration, property management, governance and financial decision-making. The authority was compelled to commit to a three-year improvement plan in which the entire structure of the council would be overhauled. As a result of the intervention, major structural changes at the City Council took place by the [[2023 United Kingdom local elections]], which were labelled "the most unpredictable [elections] in the city's history". The number of electoral wards in the city was doubled from 30 to 64, while the overall number of City Councillors up for election was reduced from 90 to 85. In future, the council would also change to 'all out' elections every four years whereby every single City Councillor would be eligible for re-election at the same time. The role of [[Mayor of Liverpool|elected city mayor]] was also abolished and the Council reverted to the previous [[Executive arrangements|Leader and Cabinet]] style of leadership. The outcome of the elections were seen not only as a test of how the general public would respond to the government intervention in the city, but also to 
Prime Minister [[Rishi Sunak]]'s government as a whole.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Why this month's local elections in Liverpool could the most unpredictable in the city's history|url=https://www.itv.com/news/granada/2023-04-28/another-major-contest-heading-to-liverpool-in-may|access-date=25 September 2023|website=itv.com|archive-date=25 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230925202902/https://www.itv.com/news/granada/2023-04-28/another-major-contest-heading-to-liverpool-in-may|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Liverpool City Council: Volume 691: debated on Wednesday 24 March 2021|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2021-03-24/debates/D5462F6C-2F3A-425D-A5A2-96998A1050BA/LiverpoolCityCouncil#contribution-A781CB1C-F978-4AE3-BB94-8350F8ED5DD6|access-date=25 September 2023|website=hansard.parliament.uk|archive-date=25 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230925202903/https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2021-03-24/debates/D5462F6C-2F3A-425D-A5A2-96998A1050BA/LiverpoolCityCouncil#contribution-A781CB1C-F978-4AE3-BB94-8350F8ED5DD6|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Government decision on Best Value interventions announced|url=https://liverpoolexpress.co.uk/government-decision-on-best-value-interventions-announced|access-date=25 September 2023|website=liverpoolexpress.co.uk|date=10 June 2021|archive-date=25 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230925202941/https://liverpoolexpress.co.uk/government-decision-on-best-value-interventions-announced/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Government increases intervention in Liverpool after another critical report|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/steve-rotheram-greg-clark-liverpool-city-council-liverpool-government-b2148526.html|access-date=25 September 2023|website=independent.co.uk|date=19 August 2022|archive-date=25 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230925202902/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/steve-rotheram-greg-clark-liverpool-city-council-liverpool-government-b2148526.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Liverpool Strategic Futures Advisory Panel, chaired by the [[Metro Mayor of the Liverpool City Region|Mayor of Liverpool City Region]] [[Steve Rotheram]], and including several high-profile figures with experience in [[Local government in England|local government]], was established.

In February 2008, Liverpool City Council was reported to be the worst-performing council in the country, receiving just a one-star rating (classified as inadequate). The main cause of the poor rating was attributed to the council's poor handling of tax-payer money, including the accumulation of a £20m shortfall while the city held the title of [[European Capital of Culture]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Coligan|first=Nick|title=Official: Liverpool city council is worst – yes, the WORST – in the country|website=[[Liverpool Echo]]|date=7 February 2008|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2008/02/07/official-liverpool-city-council-is-worst-yes-the-worst-in-the-country-100252-20446758/|access-date=23 September 2008|archive-date=22 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522095040/http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2008/02/07/official-liverpool-city-council-is-worst-yes-the-worst-in-the-country-100252-20446758/|url-status=live}}</ref> In April 2024, the [[Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities|Office for Local Government]] released a ranking of local authorities, placing Liverpool City Council 317th out of a possible 318.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Ellson|first=Andrew|date=30 April 2024|title=Worst-performing councils in England revealed — where does yours rank?|newspaper=[[The Times]]|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/worst-council-england-uk-nottingham-xkpb5jzmz|access-date=30 April 2024|issn=0140-0460|archive-date=30 April 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240430153000/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/worst-council-england-uk-nottingham-xkpb5jzmz|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Lord Mayor of Liverpool ===
{{Not to be confused with|text=elected [[Mayor of the Liverpool City Region]] See below}}
The [[Lord Mayor of Liverpool]] is an ancient ceremonial role. Councillors within Liverpool City Council (not the general public) elect the Lord Mayor annually, who then serves a one-year term. The Lord Mayor is styled as the "first citizen" and is chosen to represent the city at civic functions and engagements, promote it to the wider world, support local charities and community groups, attend religious events, meet delegates from [[Sister city|Liverpool's twin cities]], chair council meetings and confer [[Freedom of the City|Honorary Freemen and associations]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Lord Mayor of Liverpool|url=https://liverpool.gov.uk/council/councillors-and-committees/lord-mayor|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230925202904/https://liverpool.gov.uk/council/councillors-and-committees/lord-mayor|archive-date=25 September 2023|access-date=25 September 2023|website=liverpool.gov.uk}}</ref> The Lord Mayor is also the presiding officer for Liverpool City Council full meetings.[[File:Liverpool Town Hall front 2018.jpg|thumb|right|[[Liverpool Town Hall]] houses the official office for the [[Lord Mayor of Liverpool]]]]

In 2010, Liverpool City Council and the Primary Care Trust commissioned the [[Mersey Forest]] to complete "A Green Infrastructure Strategy" for the city.<ref>Liverpool Green Infrastructure Strategy – ginw.co.uk/liverpool</ref>

====Green belt====
{{further|North West Green Belt}}
Liverpool is a core urban element of a [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] region that extends into the wider surrounding counties, which is in place to reduce [[urban sprawl]], prevent the towns in the conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage [[brownfield]] reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Draft Liverpool Local Plan September 2016|url=http://liverpool.gov.uk/media/1355685/the-draft-liverpool-local-plan-september-2016-bc.pdf|website=liverpool.gov.uk|access-date=21 February 2018|archive-date=15 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210515034427/https://liverpool.gov.uk/media/1355685/the-draft-liverpool-local-plan-september-2016-bc.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Due to being already highly built up, the city contains limited portions of protected green belt area within [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] throughout the borough at [[Fazakerley]], [[Croxteth Hall]] and country park and Craven Wood, Woodfields Park and nearby golf courses in [[Netherley, Liverpool|Netherley]], small greenfield tracts east of the [[Speke]] area by the St Ambrose primary school, and the small hamlet of [[Oglet]] and the surrounding area south of [[Liverpool John Lennon Airport|Liverpool Airport]].<ref name="belt2">{{cite web|title=Liverpool City Council – Draft Liverpool Local Plan – 12 Green Infrastructure|url=http://consult.liverpool.gov.uk/portal/draft_liverpool_local_plan?pointId=s1429871636491#section-s1429871636491|website=consult.liverpool.gov.uk}}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

The green belt was first drawn up in 1983 under Merseyside County Council<ref>{{cite web|title=Knowsley and Sefton Green Belt Study Nov 2012|url=http://www.knowsley.gov.uk/pdf/eb08_knowsleyandseftongreenbeltstudy.pdf|website=knowsley.gov.uk|access-date=21 February 2018|archive-date=8 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308001240/http://www.knowsley.gov.uk/pdf/eb08_knowsleyandseftongreenbeltstudy.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the size in the city amounts to {{convert|530|ha|km2+sqmi}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Green belt statistics – GOV.UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/green-belt-statistics|website=gov.uk|date=16 September 2022|access-date=21 February 2018|archive-date=3 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703133634/https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/green-belt-statistics|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Other demonyms===
Prior to the establishment of Scouser as there have been a number of different terms used to refer to inhabitants of Liverpool of varying popularity and longevity:

Professor Tony Crowley argues that up until the 1950s, inhabitants of Liverpool were generally referred to by a number of demonyms. He argues that there was a debate in the mid 20th century between the two rival terms of 'Liverpolitan' and 'Liverpudlian'. The debate surrounded the lexicology of these terms and their connotations of social class.<ref name=TonyCrowleyBook/><ref name=TonyCrowleyEcho1>{{Cite web|title=Paddy Shennan talks to Tony Crowley, the author of a new book about the language of Liverpool|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/paddy-shennan-talks-tony-crowley-3331789|access-date=19 March 2024|website=liverpoolecho.co.uk|date=8 October 2012|archive-date=20 March 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240320122036/https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/paddy-shennan-talks-tony-crowley-3331789|url-status=live}}</ref>

Professor John Belchem suggests that a series of other nicknames such as 'Dick Liver', 'Dicky Sam' and 'whacker' were used, but gradually fell out of use. Belchem and Philip Boland suggest that comedic radio presenters and entertainers brought the Liverpool identity to a national audience, which in turn encouraged locals to be gradually more known as 'scousers'. By the time that Frank Shaw's ''My Liverpool, a Celebration of 'Scousetown''' was published in 1971, Belchem argues that 'Scouser' had firmly become the dominant demonym.<ref name=JohnBelchamMerseyPride/><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Sonic geography, place and race in the formation of local identity: Liverpool and Scousers|url=https://www.academia.edu/11739532|access-date=20 March 2024|journal=Geografiska Annaler: Series B, Human Geography|date=January 2010|last1=Boland|first1=Philip|volume=92|pages=1–22|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0467.2010.00330.x|archive-date=24 March 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240324214045/https://www.academia.edu/11739532|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The rise and fall of Liverpool sectarianism: An investigation into the decline of sectarian antagonism on Merseyside|url=https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/2010280/3/RobertsKei_April2015_2010280.pdf|access-date=20 March 2024|website=livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk|archive-date=20 March 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240320210425/https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/2010280/3/RobertsKei_April2015_2010280.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

|'''Date'''||'''Population'''||'''Notes'''
|-
|'''1207'''||||Borough of Liverpool founded by [[John, King of England]]. The economy was focused on agricultural and food processing, [[Gristmill|grain mills]] and warehouses until the 16th century.
|-
|'''1272'''||840||
|-
|'''14th century'''||1,000 – 1,200|| Population roughly 1,000 in 1300. Because Liverpool was a port, it was more at risk from the spread of disease. Townspeople lived partly by farming and fishing. Some were craftsmen or tradesmen such as bakers, brewers, butchers, blacksmiths, and carpenters. A [[watermill]] existed to ground grain into flour for the townspeople's bread, and there was a windmill. [[Black Death]] wiped out whole families and bodies were buried in a mass grave at [[Church of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas, Liverpool|St Nicholas's churchyard]]. 
|-
|'''16th century'''||||Ireland was still Liverpool's main trading partner. In 1540, a writer said: "Irish merchants come much hither as to a good harbor". He also said there was "good merchandise at Liverpool and much Irish [[yarn]], that [[Manchester]] men buy there". Skins and hides were still imported from Ireland. Exports from Liverpool included coal, woolen cloth, knives and leather goods. There were still many fishermen in Liverpool. In the mid 16th century, the town was under the control of the country [[gentry]] and trade was slow. The population dropped to below 600, in part due to deaths in the [[1557 influenza pandemic|1558 plague]] when a third of the townspeople died. Further [[Second plague pandemic|plague outbreaks]] took place in 1609, 1647 and 1650 which led to static or retrogressive population levels. The town was regarded as subordinate to [[Chester]] until the 1650s.
|-
|'''1600'''||<2,000||English troops bound for [[List of Irish uprisings|rebellions in Ireland]] settled in the 16th and early 17th centuries.
|-
|'''1626'''||||[[Charles I of England]] issued new [[Municipal charter|Charter]] for the town. Trade with other cities, Ireland, [[Isle of Man]], France and Spain increased. Fish and wool was exported to the [[Continental Europe|Continent]], and wines, iron and other commodities imported. In the following decades, merchants invested in Liverpool and its importance grew. Regular shipping began to America and [[West Indies]]. Liverpool was controlled by [[the Crown]], the Molyneux and Stanley families. 
|-
|'''1642'''||2,500||Liverpool overtook [[Chester]] in exporting coal and salt in early 17th century, especially to Ireland. 
|-
|'''1644'''||||During [[English Civil War]], [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] led a [[Cavalier|royalist]] army to capture Liverpool. He described the town as a "mere crow's nest which a parcel of boys could take". He stormed [[Liverpool Castle]] in the 'Siege of Liverpool' with considerable slaughter.
|-
|'''1647'''||||Liverpool was made a free and independent port, no longer subject to [[Chester]].
|-
|'''1648'''||||First recorded cargo from America landed at Liverpool.
|-
|'''Late 17th century'''||||Liverpool grew rapidly with the growth of [[Colonial history of the United States|English colonies in North America]] and [[British West Indies|West Indies]]. Liverpool was well placed to trade across Atlantic Ocean. The writer [[Celia Fiennes]] visited Liverpool and said: "Liverpool is built on the [[River Mersey]]. It is mostly newly built, of brick and stone after the London fashion. The original (town) was a few fishermen's houses. It has now grown into a large, fine town. It is but one parish with one church though there be 24 streets in it, there is indeed a little chapel and there are a great many dissenters in the town ([[Protestants]] who did not belong to the [[Church of England]]). It's a very rich trading town, the houses are of brick and stone, built high and even so that a street looks very handsome. The streets are well paved. There is an abundance of persons who are well dressed and fashionable. The streets are fair and long. It's London in miniature as much as I ever saw anything. There is a very pretty exchange. It stands on 8 pillars, over which is a very handsome [[Liverpool Town Hall|Town Hall]]."
|-
|'''1700'''||5,714||First recorded Liverpool [[slave ship]], the 'Liverpool Merchant', sold a cargo of 220 [[Slavery|slaves]] in Barbados. In the early 1700s, the writer [[Daniel Defoe]] said: "Liverpool has an opulent, flourishing and increasing trade to [[Virginia]] and English colonies in America. They trade around the whole island (of Great Britain), send ships to [[Norway]], to [[Hamburg]], and to the [[Baltic states|Baltic]] as also to [[Holland]] and [[Flanders]] (roughly modern [[Belgium]])." [[Welsh people|Welsh]] people in search of work and opportunity made up a large amount of population in early 18th century. 
|-
|'''1715'''||||[[Old Dock|World's first wet dock]] opened in Liverpool, symbolising a new era in the town's growth, the starting point of the 18th century boom in Liverpool's fortunes.
|-
|'''1720s'''||||[[Liverpool Castle]] demolished (built in the 1230s)
|-
|'''1750'''||20,000||
|-
|'''1795'''||||Influx of Irish, [[Welsh people|Welsh]], Scandinavian and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] communities grew the town rapidly. Most of the population were not native to Liverpool.

|'''1835'''||||Boundary of Liverpool expanded to include [[Everton, Liverpool|Everton]], [[Kirkdale, Liverpool|Kirkdale]] and parts of [[Toxteth]] and [[West Derby]]. Liverpool was second only to London in importance. Poor, overcrowded and unsanitary living conditions led to disease and epidemics of [[cholera]] in 1830s to 1860s.
|-
|'''1841'''||286,487||
|-
|'''1851'''||375,955||At the height of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|potato famine]], Liverpool's [[Irish people in Great Britain|Irish born population]] peaked to about 83,000–90,000. 43,000 were settled in the area around the docks. More Irish people lived in Liverpool than the majority of [[Historical population of Ireland|Irish towns]]. 40% of the world's trade was passing through [[Port of Liverpool|Liverpool's docks]].

|-
|'''1937'''||867,000||The highest recorded population of Liverpool [[city proper]].
|-
|'''1941'''||806,271||Liverpool's population fell in the following decades, largely due to the [[new towns movement]] and the British government's policy to displace thousands of people from major British cities (including Central Liverpool) to various [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]] such as [[Kirkby]], [[Skelmersdale]], [[Runcorn]] and [[Warrington]].

====The city====
The city of Liverpool is at the core of a much larger and more populous [[metropolitan area]], however, at the most recent [[2021 United Kingdom census|UK Census in 2021]], the area governed by [[Liverpool City Council]] had a population of 486,100, a 4.2% increase from the previous [[2011 United Kingdom census|Census in 2011]]. This figure increased to 500,500 people by 2022, according to data from Liverpool City Council.

Taking in to account how [[Local government in England|local government]] is organised within the cities and metropolitan areas of England, the city of Liverpool was the fifth largest of England's [[Core Cities Group|'core cities']] and had the second overall highest population density of those, by 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|title=How the population changed in Liverpool: Census 2021|url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/censuspopulationchange/E08000012|access-date=3 September 2023|website=ons.gov.uk|archive-date=23 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230923021438/https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/censuspopulationchange/E08000012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Demography – Census 2021|url=https://liverpool.gov.uk/council/key-statistics-and-data/census-2021/demography|access-date=3 September 2023|website=liverpool.gov.uk|archive-date=3 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230903110427/https://liverpool.gov.uk/council/key-statistics-and-data/census-2021/demography|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=What is the population of Liverpool and how big is it?|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/what-population-liverpool-how-big-25304427|access-date=3 September 2023|website=liverpoolecho.co.uk|date=25 October 2022|archive-date=3 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230903110425/https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/what-population-liverpool-how-big-25304427|url-status=live}}</ref>

The population of the city has steadily risen since the [[2001 United Kingdom census|2001 Census]]. As well as having a growing population, the population density also grew at the 2021 Census compared to the previous Census. This makes Liverpool the second most densely populated local authority in [[North West England]], after [[Manchester]].

The population of the city is comparatively younger than that of England as a whole. Family life in the city is also growing at odds with the North West England region as a whole: At the 2021 Census, the percentage of households including a couple without children increased in Liverpool, but fell across the North West. The percentage of people aged 16 years and over (excluding full-time students) who were employed also increased in Liverpool compared to the overall North West region where it fell.

More people in the city identified as [[British Asians|Asian]] and [[Black British people|Black]] in the [[2021 United Kingdom census|most recent census]], compared to the previous census.]]

The 2021 Census also showed that Liverpool's [[Ethnic groups in the United Kingdom|ethnic]] and international population was growing. The number of residents in the city born outside of England has increased since the previous Census, while the number of residents who did not identify with any [[Countries of the United Kingdom|national identity associated with the UK]] has also increased at a faster rate than England as a whole. The overall share of the city's population who identified as [[British Asians|Asian]] and [[Black British people|Black]] increased, while the percentage who identified as [[White people in the United Kingdom|white]] decreased in the city compared with previous Census.<ref name="auto2">{{Cite web|title=How life has changed in Liverpool: Census 2021|url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/censusareachanges/E08000012|access-date=8 September 2023|website=ons.gov.uk|archive-date=18 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230918184738/https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/censusareachanges/E08000012|url-status=live}}</ref>

It has been argued that the city can claim to have one of the strongest [[Irish people|Irish heritages]] in the United Kingdom, with as many as 75 percent (estimated) of Liverpool's population with some form of [[Irish people in Great Britain|Irish ancestry]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Liverpool is a city with deep Irish roots|url=https://www.irishecho.com/2022/4/liverpool-has-deep-irish-roots|access-date=8 September 2023|website=irishecho.com|archive-date=5 July 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220705192603/https://www.irishecho.com/2022/4/liverpool-has-deep-irish-roots|url-status=live}}</ref>

The growing population of Liverpool in the 21st century reverses a trend which took place between the 1930s and 2001, when the population of the [[city proper]] effectively halved.

At the [[1931 United Kingdom census]], Liverpool's population reached an all-time high of 846,302. Following this peak, in response to central government policy, the Council authority of Liverpool then built and owned large several [[New towns in the United Kingdom|'new town']] [[Public housing in the United Kingdom|council estates]] in the suburbs within Liverpool's metropolitan area. Tens of thousands of people were systematically relocated to new housing in areas such as [[Borough of Halton|Halton]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley|Knowsley]], [[Metropolitan Borough of St Helens|St Helens]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton|Sefton]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral|Wirral]], [[Cheshire West and Chester]], [[West Lancashire]], [[Warrington]] and as far as [[North Wales]].

Such a mass relocation and population loss during this time was common practice for many British cities, including London and [[Manchester]], In contrast, satellite towns such as [[Kirkby]], [[Skelmersdale]] and [[Runcorn]] saw a corresponding rise in their populations (Kirkby being the fastest growing town in Britain during the 1960s).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Was the decline in Liverpool's historic population really that unusual?|url=https://citymonitor.ai/government/was-decline-liverpool-s-historic-population-really-unusual-3490|access-date=8 September 2023|website=citymonitor.ai|archive-date=18 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230918231819/https://citymonitor.ai/government/was-decline-liverpool-s-historic-population-really-unusual-3490|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Liverpool District|url=https://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10105821/cube/TOT_POP|access-date=8 September 2023|website=visionofbritain.org.uk|archive-date=30 September 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220930211936/https://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10105821/cube/TOT_POP|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="auto2"/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Ravetz|first1=Alison|title=Council housing and culture|date=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-415-23945-5|edition=New}}</ref>

====Urban and metropolitan area====
Liverpool is typically grouped with the wider [[Merseyside]] (plus [[Borough of Halton|Halton]]) area for the purpose of defining its metropolitan footprint, and there are several methodologies. Sometimes, this metropolitan area is broadened to encompass urban settlements in the neighbouring counties of [[Lancashire]] and [[Cheshire]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Rebalancing Britain: Policy of Slogan?

The [[Office for National Statistics]] in the United Kingdom uses the international standardised [[International Territorial Level|International Territorial Levels (ITLs)]] to divide up the [[Economy of the United Kingdom|economic territory of the UK]]. This enables the ONS to calculate regional and local statistics and data. The ONS uses a series of codes to identify these areas. In order of hierarchy from largest area to smallest area, Liverpool is part of the following regions:<ref>{{Cite web|title=International geographies|url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/eurostat#north-west-england|access-date=9 September 2023|website=ons.gov.uk|archive-date=18 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230918184739/https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/eurostat#north-west-england|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=International, regional and city statistics|url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/programmesandprojects/europeancitystatistics|access-date=9 September 2023|website=ons.gov.uk|archive-date=22 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211122215435/https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/programmesandprojects/europeancitystatistics|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Open Geography Portal|url=https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/search?q=itl|access-date=9 September 2023|website=geoportal.statistics.gov.uk|archive-date=18 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230918184748/https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/search?q=itl|url-status=live}}</ref>

The smallest ITL 3 area classed as Liverpool (code TLD72), therefore, had a population of 486,100 at the 2021 Census.

=====Other definitions=====

At the 2021 Census, the ONS used a refreshed concept of built-up areas (BUAs) based on the physical built environment, using [[satellite imagery]] to recognise developed land, such as cities, towns, and villages. This allows the ONS to investigate economic and social statistics based on actual settlements where most people live. Data from the 2021 Census is not directly comparable with [[2011 United Kingdom census|2011 Census]] data due to this revised methodology. Using the population figures of BUAs at the 2021 Census (excluding London), [[Liverpool Built-up Area]] is the third largest in England with some 506,565 usual residents (behind only [[Birmingham]] and [[Leeds]]). Liverpool's built-up area is, therefore, larger than the major English cities of [[Bristol]], Manchester, [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Nottingham]] and [[Sheffield]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Towns and cities, characteristics of built-up areas, England and Wales: Census 2021|url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/articles/townsandcitiescharacteristicsofbuiltupareasenglandandwales/census2021|access-date=9 September 2023|website=ons.gov.uk|archive-date=21 November 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231121221510/https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/articles/townsandcitiescharacteristicsofbuiltupareasenglandandwales/census2021|url-status=live}}</ref>

Excluding London, the [[Liverpool City Region]] was the 4th largest [[combined authority]] area in England, by 2021. The population is approximately 1.6&nbsp;million. The Liverpool City Region is a political and economic partnership between local authorities including [[Liverpool City Council|Liverpool]], plus the [[Metropolitan borough]]s of [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley|Knowsley]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton|Sefton]], [[Metropolitan Borough of St Helens|St Helens]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral|Wirral]] and the [[Borough of Halton]]. The [[Liverpool City Region Combined Authority]] exercises strategic governance powers for the region in many areas. The economic data of the Liverpool city region is of particular policy interest to the [[Office for National Statistics]], particularly as the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] continuously explores the potential to negotiate increased [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved powers]] for each combined authority area.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Population living in an area covered by a combined authority or regional governance body that has a devolution deal with a directly elected mayor, England, as of 13 January 2023|url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/adhocs/15439populationlivinginanareacoveredbyacombinedauthorityorregionalgovernancebodythathasadevolutiondealwithadirectlyelectedmayorenglandasof13january2023|website=ons.gov.uk|access-date=10 September 2023|archive-date=18 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230918184742/https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/adhocs/15439populationlivinginanareacoveredbyacombinedauthorityorregionalgovernancebodythathasadevolutiondealwithadirectlyelectedmayorenglandasof13january2023|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Liverpool City Region|url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/areas/E47000004|website=ons.gov.uk|access-date=10 September 2023|archive-date=18 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230918184740/https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/areas/E47000004|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Combined Authority economic indicators|url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/output/articles/combinedauthorityeconomicindicators/2017-03-14|website=ons.gov.uk|access-date=10 September 2023|archive-date=18 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230918184738/https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/output/articles/combinedauthorityeconomicindicators/2017-03-14|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Compare Liverpool combined authority|url=https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/comb/1853882372/subreports/pop_compared/report.aspx?allInGB=&pivot=total&&sort=1&ascending=|website=nomisweb.co.uk|access-date=10 September 2023|archive-date=18 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230918184737/https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/lmp/comb/1853882372/subreports/pop_compared/report.aspx?allInGB=&pivot=total&&sort=1&ascending=|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2006, in an attempt to harmonise the series of metropolitan areas across the European Union, ESPON (now [[European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion]]) released a study defining a "[[ESPON metropolitan areas in the United Kingdom|Liverpool/Birkenhead Metropolitan area]]" with an estimated population of 2,241,000 people. The metro area comprised a functional urban area consisting of a contiguous urban sprawl, labour pool, and commuter [[Travel to work area]]s. The analysis defined this metropolitan area as Liverpool itself, combined with the surrounding areas of [[Birkenhead]], [[Wigan]]/[[Ashton-in-Makerfield|Ashton]], [[Warrington]], [[Widnes]]/[[Runcorn]], [[Chester]], [[Southport]], [[Ellesmere Port]], [[Ormskirk]] and [[Skelmersdale]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espon.eu/export/sites/default/Documents/Projects/ESPON2006Projects/StudiesScientificSupportProjects/UrbanFunctions/fr-1.4.3_April2007-final.pdf#page=119|title=British urban pattern: population data|access-date=14 May 2012|date=March 2007|website=ESPON project 1.4.3 Study on Urban Functions|publisher=[[European Spatial Planning Observation Network]]|page=119|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924002318/http://www.espon.eu/export/sites/default/Documents/Projects/ESPON2006Projects/StudiesScientificSupportProjects/UrbanFunctions/fr-1.4.3_April2007-final.pdf#page=119|archive-date=24 September 2015}}</ref>

===Ethnicity===
In recent decades, Liverpool's population is becoming more multicultural. According to the 2021 census, 77% of all Liverpool residents described their ethnic group as White English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish or British. The remaining 23% were described as non-White English/British. Between 2011 and 2021, there was population growth across all ethnic groups, except 'White English/British' and 'Any Other', where there were overall losses. The number of 'Other White residents' in Liverpool also increased by almost 12,000 people, with notable increases in the 'Other Asian', 'Arab', and 'Other Mixed/Multiple' population categories. The non-White English/British population as a percentage of the total population across the [[2023 Liverpool City Council election|'newly organised city electoral wards']] ranged from 5% in the [[Orrell Park (Liverpool ward)|Orrell Park]] ward to 69% in the [[Princes Park (Liverpool ward)|
Princes Park]] ward. 9 out of 10 Liverpool residents regarded English as their main language. The highest non-English languages in the city were [[Arabic]] (5,743 main speakers) followed by [[Polish language|Polish]] (4,809 main speakers). Overall, almost 45,000 residents had a main language that was not English.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|title=Ethnicity – Census 2021|url=https://liverpool.gov.uk/council/key-statistics-and-data/census-2021/ethnicity|access-date=11 September 2023|website=liverpool.gov.uk|archive-date=18 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230918184737/https://liverpool.gov.uk/council/key-statistics-and-data/census-2021/ethnicity|url-status=live}}</ref>

The parish church of Liverpool is the Anglican [[Church of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas, Liverpool|Our Lady and St Nicholas]], colloquially known as "the sailors church", which has existed near the waterfront since 1257. It regularly plays host to [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Catholic masses]]. Other notable churches include the [[Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas]] (built in the [[Neo-Byzantine architecture]] style), and the [[Gustav Adolf Church, Liverpool|Gustav Adolf Church]] (the Swedish Seamen's Church, reminiscent of Nordic styles).

Liverpool's wealth as a port city enabled the construction of two enormous cathedrals in the 20th century. The [[Liverpool Cathedral|Anglican Cathedral]], which was designed by [[Giles Gilbert Scott|Sir Giles Gilbert Scott]] and plays host to the annual [[Liverpool Shakespeare Festival]], has one of the longest [[nave]]s, largest organs and heaviest and highest peals of bells in the world. The Roman Catholic [[Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]], on Mount Pleasant next to [[Liverpool Science Park]], was initially planned to be even larger. Of [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]]'s original design, only the crypt was completed. The cathedral was eventually built to a simpler design by [[Sir Frederick Gibberd]]. While this is on a smaller scale than Lutyens' original design, it still incorporates the largest panel of [[stained glass]] in the world. The road running between the two cathedrals is called [[Hope Street, Liverpool|Hope Street]]. The cathedral has long been colloquially referred to as "Paddy's Wigwam" due to its shape.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2007/05/10/faith_metro_cathedral_anniv_feature.shtml|title=Cathedral celebrates anniversary|publisher=BBC News|access-date=23 December 2019|archive-date=16 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210516045905/http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2007/05/10/faith_metro_cathedral_anniv_feature.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref>

Liverpool is home to the [[Knowledge Quarter, Liverpool|Knowledge Quarter]], a 450-acre city centre district that hosts some of the world's most influential institutions in science, health, technology, education, music and the creative performing arts. The [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK government]] has also identified the city as a '[[Pharmaceutical industry in the United Kingdom|pharmaceutical]] production superpower' and one of the UK's leading regions for [[Biomanufacturing|bioprocessing]]. The accolade led to the government choosing the city for England's second ever 'Investment Zone' in 2023. This will involve millions of pounds being invested over the coming years in to science orientated districts including the Knowledge Quarter and the so-called 'pharma cluster' in the city suburb of [[Speke]]. The two clusters form an internationally significant role in [[Infectious diseases (medical specialty)|infectious disease]] control.

The city is also the UK's largest port for [[Transatlantic crossing|transatlantic trade]], handling 45% of the country's trade from the United States. In 2023, the city was chosen by the British government to be a designated [[Free ports in the United Kingdom|Freeport]] to encourage growing international commerce.

===City region economy and devolution===

The policy agenda of the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] is to continuously monitor the economy and productivity of the UK's [[Core Cities Group|core cities]] within the context of their respective [[city region]]s. The government's longer-term plan is to assess each area's potential for increased [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution]] and transfer of additional powers and budgets from central government in [[Whitehall]] to their corresponding [[Combined authority|combined authorities]]. As such, official statistics about Liverpool's economy within the context of the [[Liverpool City Region]], are closely monitored by the [[Office for National Statistics]]. This allows policy and decision makers to more accurately assess the 'functional economic area' of the city, which is not bound by traditional [[Local government in England|local government geographies]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Combined Authorities and Regions (December 2017) Map in England|url=https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/documents/ons::combined-authorities-and-regions-december-2017-map-in-england-1/explore|access-date=14 September 2023|website=geoportal.statistics.gov.uk|archive-date=18 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230918184740/https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/documents/ons::combined-authorities-and-regions-december-2017-map-in-england-1/explore|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=English devolution: combined authorities and metro mayors|url=https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/article/explainer/english-devolution-combined-authorities-and-metro-mayors|access-date=14 September 2023|website=instituteforgovernment.org.uk|date=15 July 2019|archive-date=18 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230918184740/https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/article/explainer/english-devolution-combined-authorities-and-metro-mayors|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Levelling up the UK's regional economies|url=https://www.centreforcities.org/reader/levelling-up-the-uks-regional-economies/the-development-of-mayoral-combined-authorities|access-date=14 September 2023|website=centreforcities.org|archive-date=18 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230918184744/https://www.centreforcities.org/reader/levelling-up-the-uks-regional-economies/the-development-of-mayoral-combined-authorities/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Briefing Paper: Number 06649, 17 December 2019: Combined authorities|url=https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN06649/SN06649.pdf|access-date=14 September 2023|website=researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk|archive-date=7 May 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220507211446/https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN06649/SN06649.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=A guide to devolution and why it matters|url=https://www.newlocal.org.uk/articles/a-guide-to-devolution-and-why-it-matters|access-date=14 September 2023|website=newlocal.org.uk|date=24 January 2020|archive-date=18 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230918212613/https://www.newlocal.org.uk/articles/a-guide-to-devolution-and-why-it-matters/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The value of Liverpool's architecture and design was recognised in 2004, when several areas throughout the city were declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Known as the [[Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City]], the sites were added in recognition of the city's role in the development of [[international trade]] and [[dock (maritime)|docking]] technology.<ref>{{cite web|title=Liverpool – Maritime Mercantile City|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1150|access-date=26 May 2008|archive-date=6 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806225950/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1150|url-status=live}}</ref> However, this status was revoked in July 2021, when UNESCO resolved that recent and proposed developments, such as the [[Bramley-Moore Dock Stadium]] and [[Liverpool Waters]] projects, had resulted in the "serious deterioration" of the area's significance.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-57879475 "Liverpool stripped of Unesco World Heritage status",  News$4, 21 July 2021] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210724114404/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-57879475 |date=24 July 2021 }}.

===Waterfront and docks===

[[File:Tall buildings on Liverpool Waterfront.jpg|thumb|Modern office and commercial developments on the Liverpool Waterfront]]
As a major British port, the docks in Liverpool have historically been central to the city's development. Several major docking firsts have occurred in the city including the construction of the world's first enclosed [[wet dock]] (the [[Old Dock]]) in 1715 and the first ever [[hydraulic]] lifting [[crane (machine)|cranes]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jones|first=Ron|title=Albert Dock, Liverpool|publisher=R.J.

Today, the Royal Albert Dock houses restaurants, bars, shops, two hotels as well as the [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]], [[International Slavery Museum]], [[Tate Liverpool]] and [[The Beatles Story]]. North of the city centre is [[Stanley Dock]], home to the [[Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse]], which was at the time of its construction in 1901, the world's largest building in terms of area<ref name="Nicholls, p38">{{harvnb|Nicholls|2005|p=38 }}</ref> and today stands as the world's largest brick-work building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/nof/docks/access/theme10.html#sta|title=Trading Places: A History of Liverpool Docks (Stanley Dock)|website=Liverpool Museums|access-date=12 April 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028185038/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/nof/docks/access/theme10.html|archive-date=28 October 2008}}</ref>

One of the most famous locations in Liverpool is the [[Pier Head]], renowned for the trio of buildings – the [[Royal Liver Building]], the [[Cunard Building]] and the [[Port of Liverpool Building]] – which sit upon it. Collectively referred to as the ''Three Graces'', these buildings stand as a testament to the great wealth in the city during the late 19th and early 20th century. Built in a variety of architectural styles, they are recognised as being the symbol of 'maritime Liverpool' and are regarded by many as contributing to one of the most impressive waterfronts in the world.<ref>{{harvnb|Liverpool City Council|2005|p=49 }}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Moscardini|2008|p=10 }}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Nicholls|2005|p=11 }}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Sharples|2004|p=67 }}</ref>

In the 21st century, several areas along Liverpool's waterfront have undergone significant redevelopment. Among the notable developments are the [[Museum of Liverpool]], the construction of the [[Liverpool Arena]], [[ACC Liverpool]] and [[Exhibition Centre Liverpool]] on [[King's Dock, Port of Liverpool|King's Dock]], [[Alexandra Tower, Liverpool|Alexandra Tower]] and [[1 Princes Dock]] on [[Prince's Dock, Liverpool|Prince's Dock]] and [[Liverpool Marina]] around [[Coburg Dock|Coburg]] and [[Brunswick Dock]]s.

However, plans to redevelop parts of [[Liverpool city centre]] have been marred by [[controversy]]. In December 2016, a newly formed company called [[North Point Global Ltd.]] was given the rights to develop part of the docks under the "New Chinatown" working name. Though heavily advertised in Liverpool, Hong Kong and Chinese cities with high profile advertisements and videos, the "New Chinatown" development failed to materialise.<ref name="at">{{cite news|last1=Cook|first1=Richard|title=How Liverpool's 'New Chinatown' became black hole for Asian money|url=https://asiatimes.com/article/liverpools-new-chinatown-became-black-hole-asian-money/|access-date=16 March 2018|publisher=Asia Times|date=31 August 2017}}</ref> In January 2018, the ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'' and ''[[Asia Times]]'' revealed that the site remained sans any construction. North Point Global as well as its subcontractor "Bilt" had both declared bankruptcy, and the small investors (mostly middle class couples) who had already paid money for the apartments had lost most of their savings in them.<ref name="echo">{{cite news|last1=Houghton|first1=Alistair|title=New Chinatown site is a 'disgrace' with rats and litter say furious residents|url=https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/newsliverpool/new-chinatown-site-is-a-disgrace-with-rats-and-litter-say-furious-residents/ar-AAuXUiA|access-date=16 March 2018|newspaper=Liverpool Echo|date=21 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316214124/https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/newsliverpool/new-chinatown-site-is-a-disgrace-with-rats-and-litter-say-furious-residents/ar-AAuXUiA|archive-date=16 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Commercial district and cultural quarter===
[[File:St Georges Hall Liverpool 3 (6727529617).jpg|thumb|[[St George's Hall, Liverpool|St George's Hall]]]]

Liverpool's historic position as one of the most important trading ports in the world has meant that over time many grand buildings have been constructed in the city as headquarters for shipping firms, insurance companies, banks and other large firms. The great wealth this brought then allowed for the development of grand civic buildings, which were designed to allow the local administrators to 'run the city with pride'.<ref name="Liverpool City of Architecture">{{harvnb|Hughes|1999 }}</ref>

The [[commercial district]] is centred on the [[Castle Street, Liverpool|Castle Street]], [[Dale Street]] and Old Hall Street areas of the city, with many of the area's roads still following their [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval]] layout. Having developed predominantly over a period of three centuries, the area is regarded as one of the most important architectural locations in the city, as recognised by its inclusion in Liverpool's [[Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City|former World Heritage site]].<ref>{{harvnb|Liverpool City Council|2005|p=73 }}</ref>

The oldest building in the area is the [[Grade I]] [[listed building|listed]] [[Liverpool Town Hall]], which is located at the top of Castle Street and dates from 1754. Often regarded as the city's finest piece of [[Georgian architecture]], the building is known as one of the most extravagantly decorated civic buildings anywhere in Britain.<ref name="Liverpool City Council (2005), p74">{{harvnb|Liverpool City Council|2005|p=74 }}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Sharples|2004|p=48 }}</ref> Also on Castle Street is the Grade I listed [[Bank of England, Liverpool|Bank of England Building]], constructed between 1845 and 1848, as one of only three provincial branches of the [[Bank of England|national bank]].<ref name="Liverpool City Council (2005), p74"/> Among the other buildings in the area are the [[Tower Buildings, Liverpool|Tower Buildings]], [[Albion House, Liverpool|Albion House]] (the former [[White Star Line]] headquarters), the [[Municipal Buildings, Liverpool|Municipal Buildings]] and [[Oriel Chambers]],<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_pQPhVWNTY Manchester School of Architecture video] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029112630/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_pQPhVWNTY |date=29 October 2013 }} YouTube</ref> which is considered to be one of the earliest [[Modernist]] style buildings ever built.<ref>{{cite web|title=Oriel Chambers|publisher=Liverpool Architectural Society|url=http://www.liverpoolarchitecture.com/tours/buildings/building.php?id=25|access-date=14 July 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922062904/http://www.liverpoolarchitecture.com/tours/buildings/building.php?id=25|archive-date=22 September 2008}}</ref>

The area around [[William Brown Street]] is referred to as the city's 'Cultural Quarter', owing to the presence of numerous civic buildings, including the [[William Brown Library]], [[Walker Art Gallery]], [[Picton Reading Room and Hornby Library|Picton Reading Rooms]] and [[World Museum Liverpool]]. The area is dominated by [[neo-classical architecture]], of which the most prominent, [[St. George's Hall, Liverpool|St George's Hall]],<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPHvynh3GQg&feature=PlayList&p=DC9B6CD6A63D327E&index=30 Manchester School of Architecture video] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029112643/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPHvynh3GQg&feature=PlayList&p=DC9B6CD6A63D327E&index=30 |date=29 October 2013 }} YouTube</ref> is widely regarded as the best example of a neo-classical building anywhere in Europe.<ref>{{harvnb|Liverpool City Council|2005|p=87 }}</ref> A Grade I listed building, it was constructed between 1840 and 1855 to serve a variety of civic functions in the city and its doors are inscribed with "[[SPQR|S.P.Q.L.]]" (Latin ''senatus populusque Liverpudliensis''), meaning "the senate and people of Liverpool". William Brown Street is also home to numerous public monuments and sculptures, including [[Wellington's Column]] and the [[Steble Fountain]]. Many others are located around the area, particularly in [[St John's Gardens, Liverpool|St John's Gardens]], which was specifically developed for this purpose.<ref>{{harvnb|Liverpool City Council|2005|p=93 }}</ref> The William Brown Street area has been likened to a modern recreation of the [[Roman Forum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tq3zz|title=People's Palaces: The Golden Age of Civic Architecture – BBC Four|publisher=BBC|access-date=18 January 2018|archive-date=29 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210429225451/https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tq3zz|url-status=live}}</ref>

While the majority of Liverpool's architecture dates from the mid-18th century onwards, there are several buildings that pre-date this time. One of the oldest surviving buildings is [[Speke Hall]], a [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] [[manor house]] located in the south of the city, which was completed in 1598.<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|1999|p=20 }}</ref> The building is one of the few remaining [[timber framed]] Tudor houses left in the [[north of England]] and is particularly noted for its [[Victorian decorative arts|Victorian]] interiors, which were added in the mid-19th century.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cousens|first=Belinda Cousins|title=Speke Hall|publisher=[[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]|year=2006|page=5}}</ref> In addition to Speke Hall, many of the city's other oldest surviving buildings are also former [[manor house]]s including [[Croxteth Hall]] and [[Woolton Hall]], which were completed in 1702 and 1704 respectively.<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|1999|p=22 }}</ref>

==Transport==
{{Main|Transport in Liverpool}}
{{further|Liverpool city centre#Transport}}
Liverpool has an extensive transport infrastructure that connects the city with its metropolitan area, the rest of the [[United Kingdom]], [[Europe]] and the world. Various modes of transport provide considerable connections by road, rail, air and sea.

The [[City proper|city of Liverpool proper]] sits at the centre of a much larger metropolitan area. The city's suburbs run contiguously in to the neighbouring boroughs of the Liverpool City Region, a heavily urbanised region with substantial road links to many other areas within England. The city is surrounded by a network of six [[List of motorways in the United Kingdom|motorways]] ([[M58 motorway|M58]] to the north, [[M56 motorway|M56]] to the south, [[M6 motorway|M6]] & [[M62 motorway|M62]] to the east and [[M53 motorway|M53]] to the west). The [[M57 motorway|M57]] also acts as an outer ring road and bypass for the city of Liverpool itself.

===Literature===
[[Felicia Hemans]] (née Browne) was born in Dale Street, Liverpool, in 1793, although she later moved to Flintshire, in Wales. Felicia was born in Liverpool, a granddaughter of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[Consulate general|consul]] in that city. Her father's business soon brought the family to [[Denbighshire (historic)|Denbighshire]] in North Wales, where she spent her youth. They made their home near Abergele and [[St. Asaph]] ([[Flintshire (historic)|Flintshire]]), and it is clear that she came to regard herself as Welsh by adoption, later referring to Wales as "Land of my childhood, my home and my dead". Her first poems, dedicated to the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]], were published in Liverpool in 1808, when she was only fourteen, arousing the interest of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], who briefly corresponded with her.

{{Copy to Wikiquote|section=yes}}
* "Lyrpole, alias Lyverpoole, a pavid towne, hath but a chapel&nbsp;... The king hath a castelet there, and the [[Earl of Derby|Earl of Darbe]] hath a stone howse there. Irisch merchants cum much thither, as to a good haven&nbsp;... At Lyrpole is smaul custom payed, that causith marchantes to resorte thither. Good marchandis at Lyrpole, and much Irish yarrn that [[Manchester]] men do buy there&nbsp;..." – [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]], ''Itinerary'', {{Circa|1536}}–1539<ref>[https://archive.org/details/itineraryjohnle07lelagoog ''The Itinerary of John Leland the Antiquary: Published from the Original MS. in the Bodleian''], p. 47</ref>
* "Liverpoole is one of the wonders of Britain&nbsp;... In a word, there is no town in England, London excepted, that can equal [it] for the fineness of the streets, and the beauty of the buildings." – [[Daniel Defoe]], ''[[A tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain]]'', 1721–1726
* "[O]ne of the neatest, best towns I have seen in England." – [[John Wesley]]. ''Journal'', 1755
* "I have not come here to be insulted by a set of wretches, every brick in whose infernal town is cemented with an African's blood." – [[George Frederick Cooke]] (1756–1812), an actor responding to being hissed at when he came onstage drunk during a visit to Liverpool<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/2008/liverpool/liverpool-cameo.html|title=Time Team &#124; Archaeology &#124; Channel 4 &#124; Tony Robinson|publisher=Channel 4|date=21 April 2008|access-date=15 April 2010|archive-date=4 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604145419/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/2008/liverpool/liverpool-cameo.html|url-status=live}}</ref>
* "That immense City which stands like another [[Venice]] upon the water&nbsp;... where there are riches overflowing and every thing which can delight a man who wishes to see the prosperity of a great community and a great empire&nbsp;... This quondam village, now fit to be the proud capital of any empire in the world, has started up like an enchanted palace even in the memory of living men." – [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine]], 1791
* "I have heard of the greatness of Liverpool, but the reality far surpasses my expectation." – [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], speech, 1846
* "Liverpool&nbsp;... has become a wonder of the world. It is the New York of Europe, a world city rather than merely British provincial." – ''[[Illustrated London News]]'', 15 May 1886
* "The dream represented my situation at the time. I can still see the greyish-yellow raincoats, glistening with the wetness of the rain. Everything was extremely unpleasant, black and opaque – just as I felt then. But I had a vision of unearthly beauty, and that is why I was able to live at all. Liverpool is the "pool of life." The "liver," according to an old view, is the seat of life, that which makes to live." – [[C. G. Jung]], ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'', 1928
* "The centre is imposing, dignified and darkish, like a city in a rather gloomy Victorian novel&nbsp;... We had now arrived in the heart of the big city, and as usual it was almost a heart of darkness. But it looked like a big city, there was no denying that. Here, emphatically, was the English seaport second only to London. The very weight of stone emphasised that fact. And even if the sun never seems to properly rise over it, I like a big city to proclaim itself a big city at once..." – [[J. B. Priestley]], ''English Journey'', 1934
* "If Liverpool can get into top gear again, there is no limit to the city's potential. The scale and resilience of the buildings and people is amazing – it is a world city, far more so than London and Manchester. It doesn't feel like anywhere else in Lancashire: comparisons always end up overseas – [[Dublin]], or [[Boston]], or [[Hamburg]]. The city is tremendous, and so, right up to the [[First World War]], were the abilities of the architects who built over it. The centre is humane and convenient to walk around in, but never loses its scale. And, in spite of [[Liverpool Blitz|the bombings]] and the carelessness, it is still full of superb buildings. Fifty years ago it must have outdone anything in England." – [[Ian Nairn]], ''Britain's Changing Towns'', 1967
