'''Western Equatoria''' is a  [[States of South Sudan|state]] in [[South Sudan]]. It has an area of {{convert |79,343|km2}}. The state capital is [[Yambio]].  The state was divided into counties, each headed by a County Commissioner. Western Equatoria seceded from [[Sudan]] as part of the Republic of South Sudan on 9 July 1956. On October 2, 2011, the state was divided into [[Amadi State|Amadi]], [[Maridi State|Maridi]], and [[Gbudwe State|Gbudwe]] states, and [[Tambura State]] was split from Gbudwe state on January 14, 2015. Western Equatoria was re-established by a peace agreement signed on 22 February 2020.<ref>[https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/02/6-years-war-peace-finally-south-sudan-200223114919537.html Aljazeera Feb 2020]</ref>

== History ==
Since the 16th century, Western Equatoria has been a home to the [[Avukaya|Avokaya]], [[Azande people|Azande]], [[Baka people (Congo and South Sudan)|Baka]], [[Moru people|Moru]], [[Mundu people|Mundu]] and [[Balanda Boor people|Balanda]].

The Mahdist Revolt of the 1880s destabilized the nascent province, and [[Equatoria]] ceased to exist as an Egyptian outpost in 1889. Important settlements in Equatoria included Lado, Gondokoro, Dufile and Wadelai. European colonial maneuverings in the region came to a head in 1898, when the Fashoda Incident occurred at present-day Kodok; Britain and France almost went to war over the region.[21] In 1947, British hopes to join South Sudan with Uganda, while leaving Western Equatoria as part of Belgian Congo were dashed by the Juba Conference to unify North and South Sudan.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

In the middle of the twentieth century, after Sudan's independence in 1956, Western Equatorians sacrificed their life for over 5 decades liberating in movements for the independence of South Sudanese, including the [[Anya Nya]] led by, Joseph Lagu and the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement]] (SPLA/M), led by [[John Garang]] de Mabior, as they envisioned of New Sudan. Western Equatoria was also known as the breadbasket state for liberators during both civil wars.

Western Equatoria was separated from its sister state of Eastern Equatoria, becoming a province in 1976<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AhEABQAAQBAJ&q=eastern+equatoria+1976&pg=PA48|title=The State of Post-conflict Reconstruction: Land, Urban Development and State-building in Juba, Southern Sudan|page=48|isbn=978-1-84701-094-0|last1=Badiey|first1=Naseem|year=2014}}</ref> and the two Equatoria provinces were once again inaugurated into 3 statehoods of Western Equatoria, Central Equatoria and Eastern Equatoria in the midst of the 1990s. Hence, there was a plan to re-unify the 3 sister states back into regions after the implementation of South Sudan's federal system. But many suggested the three states should remain in place with each governor, while having a governor general to oversee the Greater Equatoria region.
