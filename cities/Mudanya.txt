The town was the signing place of the [[Armistice of Mudanya]] between [[Turkey]], [[Italy]], [[France]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] on October 11, 1922, following the [[Turkish War of Independence]].

After the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] and the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|Greco-Turkish population exchange agreement]], the Greeks of the town were transferred into mainland [[Greece]], establishing a settlement to which they gave the name of their previous town, [[Nea Moudania]] (''New Moudania'', located on the [[Chalkidiki]] peninsula, in the [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia region]] of Greece). In return, a number of [[Cretan Turks]] were settled in Mudanya.
