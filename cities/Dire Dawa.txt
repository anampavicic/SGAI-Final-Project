Dire Dawa alongside present-day [[Sitti Zone]] were a part of the Dire Dawa autonomous region of the Somali Region stipulated in the [[1987 Constitution of Ethiopia|1987 Ethiopian Constitution]] until 1993 when it was split by the [[Government of Ethiopia|federal government]] into a separately administered chartered city.<ref>{{citation|title=Dire Dawa's dilemma: Sharing power in Ethiopia's eastern melting pot|url=https://www.ethiopia-insight.com/2021/08/02/dire-dawas-dilemma-sharing-power-in-ethiopias-eastern-melting-pot/|date=2 August 2021}}</ref>

It is divided administratively into two [[woreda]]s, the city proper and the non-urban woreda of [[Gurgura (woreda)|Gurgura]].

Dire Dawa lies in the eastern part of the nation, on the [[Dechatu River]], at the foot of a ring of cliffs. The western outskirts of the city lie on the Gorro River, a tributary of the Dechatu River. It is located at the latitude and longitude of {{coord|9|36|N|41|52|E|region:ET-DD_type:city(398000)|display=inline,title}}. The city is an industrial centre, home to several [[market (place)|market]]s and the [[Dire Dawa Airport]].

The projected population for 2015 was 440,000 for the entire chartered city and 277,000 for the city proper, making the latter the seventh largest city in Ethiopia.

=== Foundation (1902–1936) ===

The present-day town of Dire Dawa (327{{nbs}}km by rail from Djibouti), however, is of very recent origin. It owes its foundation to a technical problem: when it became impossible to lay the [[Ethio-Djibouti Railways|Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway]] via [[Harar]] because of the steep access to the town, [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Menelik II]] accepted (in a later dated 5 November 1896) that the first part of the line might finish at a village at the foot of the mountains, which should be named Addis Harar ("New Harrar").<ref name=":0" /> The railway reached this location on 24 December 1902, a date which may be considered the day of Dire Dawa's foundation.<ref>Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/place/Dire-Dawa Dire Dawa], britannica.com, USA, accessed on June 30, 2019</ref> The new name, however, did not win recognition.

For financial and diplomatic reasons the railway was not continued until 1909 and the final inauguration of the whole line from Djibouti to Addis Ababa-again delayed by the revolution of 1916-only took place on 7 June 1917. During all this time, Dire Dawa was practically the town profited much and became a "boom city", attracting most of the trade which formerly passed through Harar. By 1902 the Ethiopian government, anticipating the future economic importance of Dire Dawa, had already transferred the customs station for trade with the Red Sea from Gildessa to Dire Dawa.<ref name=":1" />

Dire Dawa developed into two settlements separated by the [[Dechatu River]], which was dry for most of the year and became a torrent only when it rained. The north-western part of the town was planned and constructed very regularly, mostly by the engineers of the railway company. At first, this part of the town mostly housed the employees of the railway company, but it later attracted, besides the French, also Greeks, Armenians, other Europeans and Arabs, who opened shops and hotels and founded some industry as well. In 1909 the French Capuchin Mission settled in Dire Dawa. At that time Dire Dawa looked like a French town.<ref name=":0" /> The other part of the town, southeast of the river, concentrated around the market and was inhabited mainly by Ethiopian, Somali and a few Arab traders.

In September 1916 the fleeing troops of [[Lij Iyasu]] took hold of the town. Though Lij Iyasu's governor there, the Syrian Hasib al-Idlibi, assured their security, 400 Europeans left the town and the rail traffic had to be suspended. After the battle of Maeso, the governmental troops from Addis Ababa re-established a regular administration.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Le chemin de fer de Djibouti à Addis-Abeba|last=van Gelder de Pineda|first=Rosanna|publisher=Harmattan|year=1995|location=Paris|pages=268–271}}</ref>

During the 1920s, the south-eastern part of the town also started to develop. Its inhabitants were mostly Somali and Oromo, the other Ethiopians playing only a minor role. The population here grew to 3,000, while that of the whole town numbered 20,000. Between the two World Wars, two hospitals were established in Dire Dawa, one by the railway company and another in 1934 by the government. Education on a primary level was provided by a government school, a Catholic mission school and several schools for the different foreign communities in the town (Greek, Italian, Indian).<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=History of Ethiopian Towns: from the Mid-Nineteenth Century to 1935|last=Pankhurst|first=Richard|year=1985|location=Stuttgart|pages=271–274}}</ref>

Dire Dawa's first governor was [[Ato Mersha Nahusenay]]. Formerly the governor of the strategic village of Gildessa and its environs, Mersha was instrumental in the construction of the first railway and establishment of the railway city.<ref>Pankhurst (2010).</ref><ref>Bekele, Shiferaw (1989).</ref> The imperial railway company (Cie) played a key role in the early development of the city, particularly Gezira (aka Kezira), under the authority of the Ethiopian government. The original failed company was reorganized as the joint-government [[Franco-Ethiopian Railway]] in 1908 and, after a period of financial negotiation and recapitalization, construction began anew, linking the city with the Ethiopian capital [[Addis Ababa]] in 1917. The Dire Dawa-Harar road was improved in 1928, shortening the travel time to only a few hours.<ref>Pankhurst, Richard R.K. ''An Economic History of Ethiopia'', pp.{{nbs}}289–290.

=== Italian occupation (1936–1941) ===

[[File:Dire Dawa Station Blackshirts 1936.jpg|thumb|Italian troops taking possession of the Dire Dawa railway station in 1936]]

On 9 May 1936 Dire Dawa was occupied by Italian troops coming from Harar, after Somali troops from Djibouti had prevented looting during the period of interregnum. [[Pietro Badoglio|Badoglio]] and [[Rodolfo Graziani|Graziani]] celebrated their meeting on the railway station of Dire Dawa. The Italians constructed several new buildings in Dire Dawa, especially for the administration and the Fascist party. They also improved the roads and enlarged the airport so that their military planes could take off from there to bomb the patriot forces in the Gara Mulleta.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brotto|first=Enrico|date=1938|title=Dire Daua|journal=Rivista delle Colonie|volume=12|pages=37–44}}</ref> As for other towns, the Italians conceived a "piano regolatore" for the construction of an Italian town in Dire Dawa. However, their occupation ended before they could complete these plans.

During the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italian invasion]], [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] ordered that Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa be spared air attacks (which included the use of [[chemical weapons]] such as [[mustard gas]]) and other destruction as a response to the demands of the United States and certain European countries for the safety of their citizens. The Italian army entered the country from the colonies of [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]] in the north and [[Italian Somaliland|Somalia]] in the southeast. Following all major engagements of the war, Dire Dawa was the location of the meeting of the two Italian forces. General [[Graziani]]'s units, advancing from Harar, reached the city's barbed-wire fence on 6 May 1936, the day after the occupation of [[Addis Ababa]] and Emperor [[Haile Selassie]]'s flight along the railroad to [[Djibouti]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. They were met by two French armed cars: the railway remained under French administration and they had remained to protect French interests. The next day, the first train under Italian control left Addis Ababa: it brought Italy's 46th Infantry Regiment and finally closed the pincers of the two Italian invasion forces. The occupation of the town was more or less a formality,<ref name=NAI-web>Nordic Africa Institute. "[http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/d/ORTDIL.pdf Local History in Ethiopia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528061210/http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/d/ORTDIL.pdf|date=2008-05-28}}". Accessed 1{{nbs}}Mar 2008.</ref> although resistance fighters known as ''Arbegnoch'' ("Patriots") continued to operate throughout the conflict. It was officially known by its Italian spelling ''Dire Daua'' during the occupation.

=== Post-Italian occupation (1941–1974) ===

In June 1940 the British started to bomb the town and on 29 March 1941 Dire Dawa was liberated by the Allied forces from Harar. The town remained under British Military Administration, being the headquarters for the British Reserved Area, till it was handed over to the Ethiopian government in 1947. In the following decades the town greatly expanded and the population grew to 160,000. The infrastructure was ameliorated and several industrial plants were established.<ref name=":1" />

Following the restoration of the empire in 1941, Dire Dawa was among the early provincial towns to have its own [[soccer]] league. Around 1947, their team{{mdash}}the Taffari{{mdash}}participated in the [[Ethiopian Football Federation|Ethiopian Championship series]]. That same year, the [[Railroad Workers Syndicate of Dire Dawa]], a [[Trade unions in Ethiopia|labor union]], was formed for welfare purposes.<ref name=NAI-web/> Although its leadership cooperated with the government, its attempt to strike in 1949 was brutally suppressed by imperial troops; at the time, all strikes were seen as forms of insurrection or treason.<ref>Keller, Edmund J. ''Revolutionary{{nbs}}Ethiopia'', p.{{nbs}}147. Indiana University Press ([[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], 1988.</ref> In 1955, a public address system was installed in the central square to receive and rebroadcast state radio transmissions.<ref name=NAI-web/>

=== Derg administration (1974–1991) ===

The [[Ethiopian Civil War|Ethiopian Revolution]] affected the city in many ways. Starting March 1974, there was some worker unrest; six people were wounded when police opened fire on demonstrating railwaymen and students on 17 April. Many Europeans, Yemeni Arabs, and Indians left Dire Dawa; the Greek and Armenian churches were eventually closed due to dwindling membership. On 3 February 1975, the [[Derg]] announced that the Cotton Company of Ethiopia was among 14 textile enterprises to be fully [[nationalization|nationalized]]. The [[portland cement|cement]] factory was also later nationalized. In August 1976, the entire leadership of the local branch of the [[Ethiopian Teachers' Association|teachers' union]] was sacked for alleged anti-revolutionary activities. Ten new officials were appointed pending fresh elections.<ref name=NAI-web/>

During the [[Ogaden War]], Dire Dawa was attacked during the [[Battle of Dire Dawa]] by Somali troops in the summer of 1977. Opposing them were the Second Militia Division, the 201st Battalion, the 781st Battalion of the Seventy-eighth Brigade, the Fourth Mechanized Company, and one platoon of the Eightieth Tank Battalion, with only two tanks. On August 17 the Somalis moved in from the Harewa side to the northeast of the city by night. Despite losing three tanks to landmines en route, they launched a ground and air assault the following day. Initially caught off guard, the Ethiopians had anticipated the attack on Jijiga instead. The battle was fierce, but it was ultimately the Ethiopian air force that shattered the Somali resolve by destroying sixteen of their tanks. By day's end, the attackers had exhausted their strength and retreated, leaving behind a trail of abandoned equipment, including tanks, armored cars, rocket launchers, artillery pieces, as well as hundreds of rifles and machine guns, all proudly displayed by the Ethiopian forces. According to Gebru Tareke, the success of the [[Ethiopian Army]] in holding Dire Dawa (17–18 August 1977) against the [[Somali Army]] was decisive in winning the [[Ogaden War]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tareke|first1=Gebru|title=The Ethiopian revolution: War in the Horn of Africa|date=2009|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-15615-7|url=https://archive.org/details/ethiopianrevolut0000gebr/page/n229/mode/2up?q=}}</ref>

In May 1979, 250 Oromos who were detained in the prisons of Dire Dawa were executed by the [[Derg]] regime.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Wagner|first=Ewald|editor-last=Uhlig|editor-first=Siegbert|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica|title=History of Dire Dawa|year=2005|publisher=Harrassowitz|volume=2|location=Wiesbaden}}</ref>

=== Federal Democratic Republic (1991–present) ===

[[File:Dire dawa, banca commerciale d'etiopia.jpg|thumb|250px|Commercial Bank of Ethiopia building]]
Dire Dawa was occupied by the [[EPRDF]] on 31 May 1991 and there were reports of about 100 people killed resisting the EPRDF. Both the [[Issa and Gurgura Liberation Front]] and the [[Oromo Liberation Front]] claimed the city. As a result, there were numerous clashes between the two groups from 1991 until 1993. When the [[Somali Region|Somali Regional State]] was being established in 1993, it wanted Dire Dawa to be its capital. This was opposed by the [[Oromia Region]], of which Dire Dawa was part of at the time, so the federal government placed the city under its own jurisdiction to avoid territorial conflict between the two regions.<ref name=Kefale2014>{{cite journal|author=Asnake Kefale <!-- Kefale is his patronym, not his last name. -->|date=2014|title=Ethnic decentralization and the challenges of inclusive governance in multiethnic cities: The case of Dire Dawa, Ethiopia|journal=Regional & Federal Studies|volume=24|issue=5|pages=589–605|doi=10.1080/13597566.2014.971772|s2cid=154137709}}</ref>

On 24 June 2002, a small explosive was detonated at the headquarters of the Ethiopian Railway Commission in Dire Dawa. The Oromo Liberation Front afterwards claimed responsibility for this attack in retaliation "for the continuing harassment of Oromo students, merchants, and farmers by the Ethiopian government." Although blamed for other isolated incidents, this was the latest bombing inside Ethiopia for which the OLF claimed responsibility.<ref>[http://www.tkb.org/Incident.jsp?incID=10529 MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base "Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) attacked Government target (June 24, 2002, Ethiopia)"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505080916/http://www.tkb.org/Incident.jsp?incID=10529|date=May 5, 2009}}, last accessed 22 April 2006.</ref>

Dire Dawa moved out of federal administration to become a chartered city in 2004 after the federal parliament approved the city charter in proclamation 416/2004.<ref name=Kefale2014/>

The city was flooded in August 2006 when both the ''Dechatu River'' and the ''Gorro River'' overflowed their banks. About 200 people were reported dead, thousands were displaced and there was extensive damage to homes and markets especially along the Dechatu River. Floods are fairly common during the June–September [[wet season|rainy season]]; over 200 people in the region had been killed by flooding in 2005 that did millions of dollars in damage.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5250386.stm Scores killed in Ethiopia floods], [[BBC News]], 6 August 2006</ref>

An overturned truck, heading from [[Dengego]] to Dire Dawa, killed 41 people 4 March 2009. The truck was carrying an unknown number of day laborers when the accident happened, and 38 were immediately killed and as many as 50 were injured. Dead and injured were taken to Dil-chora Hospital in Dire Dawa. The cause was not immediately known.<ref>[http://www.ena.gov.et/EnglishNews/2009/Mar/05Mar09/82179.htm "Death toll for recent road accident reaches 41: Police"]{{dead link|date=September 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} [[Ethiopian News Agency]] website, dated 5 March 2009 (accessed 14 April 2009)</ref>

Currently{{when?|date=December 2023}}, there are plans to revitalize the city. A historic and popular part of the city is to be demolished and replaced by a financial center, malls, mixed-use buildings, hotels, recreational facilities, and hospitals. As part of the plan, historical buildings will be renovated, and a new space will be allotted for building new homes and businesses for those displaced by the move. New roads, parks, and an industrial zone will also be built, and major railway project is expected to greatly increase business activity in the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://addisababaonline.com/dire-is-booming-but-landmark-get-the-axe/|title=Dire is booming but landmark get the axe « Addis Ababa – Addis Ababa News & City Guide|access-date=2015-08-10|archive-date=2015-09-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908203819/http://addisababaonline.com/dire-is-booming-but-landmark-get-the-axe/}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ena.gov.et/en/index.php/economy/item/804-industrial-park-to-be-constructed-in-adama-dire-dawa-cities|title=Industrial Park to be Constructed in Adama, Dire Dawa Cities|access-date=2015-08-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813024247/http://www.ena.gov.et/en/index.php/economy/item/804-industrial-park-to-be-constructed-in-adama-dire-dawa-cities|archive-date=2015-08-13}}</ref>
