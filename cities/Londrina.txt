'''Londrina''' ({{IPA|pt|lõˈdɾĩnɐ}}, literally "Little London") is a city located in the north of the state of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], [[South Region, Brazil]], and is {{convert|369|km|mi|abbr=in}} away from the state capital, [[Curitiba]]. It is the second largest city in the state and fourth largest in the southern region of the country, with 555,965 inhabitants in the city proper (2022).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://saladeimprensa.ibge.gov.br/noticias?view=noticia&id=1&busca=1&idnoticia=2704|title = Home}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Londrina (PR) {{!}} Cidades e Estados {{!}} IBGE |url=https://www.ibge.gov.br/cidades-e-estados/pr/londrina.html |access-date=2024-07-03 |website=www.ibge.gov.br}}</ref>

Londrina was originally explored by British settlers, and then officially established in 1930 by a small group of Italian, Japanese and German settlers. It rapidly became the commercial, political, and cultural centre of the state's northern pioneer zone.<ref>[http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/347161/Londrina　Londrina]　Encyclopædia Britannica、8-22-2013</ref> Its universities include the [[State University of Londrina|Universidade Estadual de Londrina]] (Londrina State University) and the [[Federal University of Technology – Paraná|Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná]] (Federal University of Technology – Paraná).

==Demography==
The city was named after British entrepreneurs who launched railroad stations in the region to ease the transportation of coffee grains from northern Paraná and southern [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] states to the [[port of Santos]]. The word ''Londrina'' pays homage to [[London|the British capital]] (''[[:pt:Londres|Londres]]'' in Portuguese), since a London cotton company, Paraná Plantations Limited, made the original investment to settle in this area.

Agricultural activity was diversified beyond [[coffee]], and today [[Maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[cotton]], [[horticulture]], [[bean]]s, [[peanut]]s, [[rice]], [[Sugarcane|sugar cane]], [[Soybean|soy bean]], and fruit plantations thrive due to the rich Northern Paraná/South Western São Paulo State "terra roxa/vermelha" crimson soil. Although the city has increased its industrial park by adding weaving, textiles and agricultural factories, Londrina's main wealth continues to be agricultural production. Today, Londrina is also known for its commerce and service sectors. Moreover, real estate is another growing sector that has generated jobs and boosted even more the size of this city in Paraná.
