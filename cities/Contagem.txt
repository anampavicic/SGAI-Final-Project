==Economy==
Contagem is primarily a city of [[heavy industry]] with a diversified industrial complex; even though minerals processing and chemicals still have a large importance. The municipality is responsible for 5.28% of the state GDP, occupying third place after Belo Horizonte and Betim.<ref>ftp://ftp.ibge.gov.br/Pib_Municipios/2010/xls/Pib_Municipal_2006_2010_xls.zip</ref>

Serious problems with water and air pollution exist, and the Pampulha Lake ([[Belo Horizonte]]) receives large quantities of heavy metals from the city.

Contagem was the first industrial district built in Minas Gerais. Inaugurated in 1946, by 1950 it was the largest in the state. The Gafanhoto power plant (on the [[Pará River]]) was built by the state government in 1952 to provide for the implementation and development of the district, which is still the largest industrial region in Minas Gerais.

Ceasa Minas Greater BH (regional wholesale supply center) is in Contagem. It has a built area of 605,000m<sup>2</sup>, with 535 companies installed, and a public on busy days of 65,000 people. It is the largest in vegetables in all of Brazil.
