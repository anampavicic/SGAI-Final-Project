'''Rialto''' is a city in [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]], [[California]], [[United States]], 56 miles east of [[Los Angeles]], near the [[Cajon Pass]], [[Interstate 15 in California|Interstate 15]], [[Interstate 10 in California|Interstate 10]], [[California State Route 210|State Route 210]] and [[Metrolink (California)|Metrolink]] routes.

Its population was 104,026 as of the [[2020 United States Census|2020 Census]], up from 99,171 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]].<ref name=quif /><ref name="U.S. Census Bureau">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0660466|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140715032656/http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0660466|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 15, 2014|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - Rialto city|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=July 12, 2014}}</ref> Its population and economic activity have grown rapidly in recent years due to the building of major distribution centers in the region.

The [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] Rialto Ammunition Storage point was used during [[World War II]] to support operations in the Pacific theater.

Rialto is home to major regional [[distribution center]]s: [[Staples Inc.]], which serves stores across the entire [[West Coast of the United States]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Under Armour]], [[Medline Industries]], [[Niagara Bottling]], [[Monster Energy]] and [[Target Corporation|Target]] in the northern region of the city, in the Las Colinas community. One of the United States' largest [[fireworks]] companies, [[Pyro Spectaculars]], is also headquartered in Rialto.
