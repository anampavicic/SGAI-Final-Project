==History==
{{For timeline}}

===Lenape and New Netherland===
{{Main|Bergen, New Netherland}}
The land that is now Jersey City was inhabited by the [[Lenape]], a collection of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes (later called Delaware Indian). In 1609, [[Henry Hudson]], seeking an alternate route to [[East Asia]], anchored his small vessel [[Halve Maen]] (English: Half Moon) at [[Sandy Hook (New Jersey)|Sandy Hook]], [[Harsimus Cove]] and [[Weehawken Cove]], and elsewhere along what was later named the [[North River (Hudson River)|North River]]. After spending nine days surveying the area and meeting its inhabitants, he sailed as far north as [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. The contemporary flag of the city is a variation on the [[Prince's Flag]] from the Netherlands. The stripes are blue, white and yellow, with the center of the flag showing the city seal, depicting Hudson's ship, the [[Halve Maen|Half Moon]], and other modern vessels.<ref>[https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us-njjec.html Jersey City, New Jersey (U.S.)], CRW Flags. Accessed November 13, 2019. "The three stripes of blue, white, and yellow are supposed to commemorate the colors of the Dutch, as Jersey City was located in the province of New Netherlands. However, the color yellow would more appropriately be orange, as blue, white, and orange were the colors in the Dutch national flag and its trading companies in the early 1600s. The sailing ship is the Half Moon, in which the explorer Henry Hudson sailed up the Hudson River in 1609."</ref>

By 1621, the [[Dutch West India Company]] was organized to manage this new territory and in June 1623, [[New Netherland]] became a Dutch province, with headquarters in [[New Amsterdam]]. [[Michael Reyniersz Pauw]] received a land grant as [[patroon]] on the condition that he would establish a settlement of not fewer than fifty persons within four years. He chose the west bank of the [[North River (Hudson River)|Hudson River]] and purchased the land from the Lenape. This grant is dated November 22, 1630, and is the earliest known conveyance for what are now [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]] and Jersey City. Pauw, however, was an [[absentee landlord]] who neglected to populate the area and was obliged to sell his holdings back to the Company in 1633.<ref>[http://www.njcu.edu/programs/jchistory/Pages/P_Pages/Pavonia.htm Jersey City Past and Present: Pavonia], [[New Jersey City University]]. Accessed May 10, 2006.</ref> That year, a house was built at [[Communipaw]] for [[Jan Evertsen Bout]], superintendent of the colony, which had been named ''[[Pavonia, New Netherland|Pavonia]]'' (the [[Latin]]ized form of Pauw's name, which means "peacock").<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060618023232/http://www.nnp.org/newvtour/regions/Hudson/pavonia.html A Virtual Tour of New Netherland], New Netherland Institute.

===19th century===
In 1804, [[Alexander Hamilton]], now a private citizen, was focused on increasing manufacturing in the greater New York City area. To that end, he helped to create the Associates of the Jersey Company which would lay the groundwork for modern Jersey City through private development. The consortium behind the company were predominantly [[Federalism|Federalists]] who, like Hamilton, had been swept out of power in the election of 1800 by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and other [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]]. Large tracts of land in [[Paulus Hook]] were purchased by the company with the titles owned by Anthony Dey, who was from a prominent old Dutch family, and his two cousins, Colonel [[Richard Varick]], the former mayor of New York City (1789–1801), and [[Jacob Radcliff]], a Justice of the New York Supreme Court who would later become mayor of New York City (twice) from 1810 to 1811 and again from 1815 to 1818. They laid out the city squares and streets that still characterize the neighborhood, giving them names also seen in [[Lower Manhattan]] or after war heroes (Grove, Varick, Mercer, Wayne, Monmouth and Montgomery among them).<ref>{{cite web|title=Associates of the Jersey Company, 1804 Jersey City's Founding Fathers|url=https://njcu.libguides.com/jerseycitypastandpresent/associatesofthejerseycompany|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190602035903/https://njcu.libguides.com/jerseycitypastandpresent/associatesofthejerseycompany|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 2, 2019|website=njcu.libguides.com|access-date=18 April 2020}}</ref>

Despite Hamilton's untimely death in August 1804, the Association carried on, though the enterprise was mired in a legal dispute between New York City and the state of [[New Jersey]] over who owned the waterfront. The unresolved dispute would continue until the Treaty of 1834 where New York City formally ceded control of Jersey City to New Jersey. Over that time though, the Jersey Company applied to the [[New Jersey Legislature]] to incorporate the Town of Jersey. The legislature enacted "An Act to incorporate the City of Jersey, in the County of Bergen" on January 28, 1820. Under the provision, five freeholders (including Varick, Dey, and Radcliff) were to be chosen as "the Board of Selectmen of Jersey City", thereby establishing the first governing body of the emerging municipality. The city was reincorporated on January 23, 1829, and again on February 22, 1838, at which time it became completely independent of North Bergen and was given its present name. On February 22, 1840, it became part of the newly created Hudson County.<ref name=Story>Snyder, John P.

Soon after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the idea arose of uniting all of the towns of Hudson County east of the Hackensack River into one municipality. A bill was approved by the state legislature on April 2, 1869, with a special election to be held on October 5, 1869. An element of the bill provide that only contiguous towns could be consolidated.

===20th and 21st centuries===
Jersey City was a dock and manufacturing town for much of the 19th and 20th centuries. Much like New York City, Jersey City has always been a destination for new immigrants to the United States. In its heyday before [[World War II]], German, [[Irish ethnicity|Irish]], and [[Italians|Italian]] immigrants found work at [[Colgate-Palmolive|Colgate]], [[Chloro]] or [[Dixon Ticonderoga]]. In 1908, the first permanent disinfection system for drinking water in the U.S. was installed on the water supply for the city by [[John L. Leal]].<ref>Leal, John L. (1909). "The Sterilization Plant of the Jersey City Water Supply Company at Boonton, N.J." ''Proceedings'' American Water Works Association. pp. 100–9.</ref> The [[North River Tunnels|Hudson Tubes]] opened in 1911, allowing passengers to take the train to [[Manhattan]] as an alternative to the extensive ferry system. The [[Black Tom explosion]] occurred on July 30, 1916, as an act of sabotage on American ammunition supplies by German agents to prevent the materials from being used by the Allies in [[World War I]].<ref>[https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2004/july/blacktom_073004 "A Byte Out of FBI History; 1916 'Black Tom' Bombing Propels Bureau Into National Security Arena"], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], July 30, 2004.

From 1917 to 1947, Jersey City was governed by Mayor [[Frank Hague]]. Originally elected as a candidate supporting reform in governance, the Jersey City History website says his name is "synonymous with the early twentieth century urban American blend of political favoritism and social welfare known as [[bossism]]".<ref>[http://www.cityofjerseycity.org/hague/index.shtml Jersey City History website]</ref> Hague ran the city with an iron fist while, at the same time, molding governors, United States senators, and judges to his whims.

Accessed June 1, 2015.</ref> In his later years in office, Hague would often dismiss his enemies as "[[red (political adjective)|red]]s" or "[[commies]]". Hague lived like a millionaire, despite having an annual salary that never exceeded $8,500. He was able to maintain a fourteen-room [[duplex (building)|duplex]] apartment in Jersey City, a suite at the [[Plaza Hotel]] in Manhattan, and a palatial summer home in the seaside community of [[Deal, New Jersey|Deal]], and travel to Europe yearly in the royal suites of the best ocean liners.<ref name="time1">Staff.

After Hague's retirement from politics, a series of mayors including [[John V. Kenny]], [[Thomas J. Whelan (mayor)|Thomas J. Whelan]] and [[Thomas F. X.

Beginning in the 1980s, development of the waterfront in an area previously occupied by rail yards and factories helped to stir the beginnings of a renaissance for Jersey City. The rapid construction of numerous high-rise buildings increased the population and led to the development of the [[Exchange Place (Jersey City)|Exchange Place]] financial district, also known as "[[Wall Street West]]", one of the largest [[financial center]]s in the United States. Large financial institutions such as [[UBS]], [[Goldman Sachs]], [[Chase Bank]], [[Citibank]], and [[Merrill Lynch]] occupy prominent buildings on the Jersey City waterfront, some of which are among the [[List of tallest buildings in Jersey City|tallest buildings in New Jersey]].
