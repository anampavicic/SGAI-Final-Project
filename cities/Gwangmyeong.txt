'''Gwangmyeong''' ({{Korean|hangul=광명시}}; {{IPA|ko|ˈkwaŋ.mjʌŋ}}) is a [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|city]] in [[Gyeonggi-do|Gyeonggi Province]], [[South Korea]]. It borders [[Seoul]] to the east, north and northeast, [[Anyang, Gyeonggi|Anyang]] to the southeast, [[Siheung]] to the southwest, and [[Bucheon]] to the northeast.

Gwangmyeong is home to one of the world's largest [[IKEA]] stores at 59,000 square meters (640,000 square feet),<ref>{{cite web |title=The Biggest IKEA Store In The World Just Opened In South Korea |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/r-in-south-korea-ikea-opens-biggest-store-to-lure-tiny-households-2014-12 |website=Business Insider |access-date=26 February 2021 |date=18 December 2014}}</ref> along with a large [[Costco]] store and a Lotte Premium Outlet.

== History ==
Gwangmyeong City area was part of the old (or original) [[Siheung County]] as with Yeongdeungpo, Guro, and Geumcheon areas. It belonged to West ({{lang|ko|서면}}, seo-myeon) and South townships ({{lang|ko|남면, nam-myeon}}) of original Siheung County. In 1914, the two townships were merged into West township of "expanded" Siheung County.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In 1963, the northern part of Gwangmyeong (at that time, the northern part of West Township in Siheung County) area was merged into an expanded Seoul (i.e. districts for urban planning in Seoul. {{lang|ko|서울시 도시계획구역 seo-ul-si do-si-gae-hoeg-gu-yeog}}) as with [[Gwacheon]] (at that time Gwacheon was a township in Siheung County) and Sindo township of [[Goyang]] County (now parts of Goyang City which borders Seoul). The neighbourhood of Gwangmyeong (Gwangmyeong-dong) and Cheolsan (Cheolsan-dong) were developed as a residence zone next to Seoul and it was provisionally planned to be administratively merged with [[Seoul|Seoul Metropolitan City]]. In 1974, Gwangmyeong-ri and Cheolsan-ri became a part of the county branch of Gwangmyeong ({{lang|ko|광명출장소}} gwang-myeong-chul-jang-so) and in 1979 southern part of Gwangmyeong area became Soha town ({{lang|ko|소하읍}} so-ha-eub). In 1981, the annexation to Seoul foundered as Seoul's unexpected rapid growth greatly concerned government officials. Consequently, the county branch of Gwangmyeong and Soha town merged and formed a new city of Gwangmyeong, instead of being annexed to Guro-gu, Seoul.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gwangmyeong.grandculture.net/Contents/Index?contents_id=GC031C010105|script-title=ko:디지털광명문화대전에 오신 것을 환영합니다.|website=gwangmyeong.grandculture.net|access-date=2013-06-03|archive-date=2013-10-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005000859/http://gwangmyeong.grandculture.net/Contents/Index?contents_id=GC031C010105|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the 1980s and the early 1990s, many apartment complexes were built in Cheolsan-dong and Haan-dong. The population increased up to 300,000. {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} In 1995, the Seoul-Gwangmyeong boundary was readjusted, in which a tiny part of Cheolsan-dong was merged into the newly created [[Geumcheon-gu]], Seoul. In 2004, [[Gwangmyeong Station]] was open, and in 2010, apartment complexes in Soha-dong were built up.

== Districts ==
[[File:Gwangmyeong_City_Hall.JPG|thumb|left|Gwangmyeong City Hall]]
There are 18 administrative districts (''[[Dong (administrative division)|dong]]'' in [[Korean language]]) in Gwangmyeong. Specifically, these are: Gwangmyeong Dong (from 1-7; Gwangmyeong 6-dong is also known as Okgil dong), Cheolsan Dong (4 dongs), Ha-an Dong (4 dongs), Soha Dong (2 dongs; The southern part of Soha 2-dong is also known as Iljik dong), and Hak-on dong (Gahak-dong and No-onsa dong). In 1995, a tiny section of Gwangmyeong was ceded to [[Seoul]]'s newly created [[Geumcheon-gu]].

== Disputes on municipal annexation to Seoul ==
[[File:Iljik-dong, Gwangmyeong-si, Gyeonggi-do 20240606 01.jpg|thumb|Iljik dong]]
Due to its history of being part of the urban planning districts of [[Seoul]] until December 1982, the living sphere of Gwangmyeong is similar to Seoul's [[Yeongdeungpo District|Yeongdeungpo]] ({{lang|ko|서울 영등포 생활권}} seo-ul yeong-deung-po saeng-hwal-kwon) rather than 'Western Gyeonggi's living sphere' ({{lang|ko|경기 서부 생활권}} gyeong-gi seo-bu-saeng-hwal-kwon) such as [[Bucheon]] and [[Anyang]]. The [[sewage system]] is linked to Seoul, though the nearest sewage treatment plant is located on the boundary between Gwangmyeong and Anyang, and the city heavily relies on Seoul's [[telephone]] and [[transport]] systems ([[Telephone numbers in South Korea|local dial code]]. The phone area code for Gwangmyeong is Seoul's 02 and many [[Seoul Buses|Seoul buses]] and [[Taxicab|taxis]] are in business in that city); advertisements of firms in Yeongdeungpo area can be easily seen in the city. Gwangmyeong not belonging to Seoul, Gwangmyeong residents have to go to a district court office and a reserve soldier's drill camp (of the 51st Infantry Division, Capital Corps) in 'farther' Ansan City other than a district court in nearby Sinjeong-dong and a reserve soldier's drill camp (of the 52nd Infantry Division, CDC) in Anyang.

Proponents of the incorporation in Seoul argue that by [[Annexation|annexing]] the city into capital Seoul, in which Gwangmyeong City of Gyeonggi Province becomes Gwangmyeong District of Seoul, the discord between a life zone and administrative districts, in terms of metropolitan governance, can be resolved. They also insist that by the annexation, residents in Gwangmyeong can benefit from metropolitan services and governance of Seoul Metropolitan City, especially in public transport. Congressman and former mayor of Gwangmyeong Baek Jae-hyeon presented a special bill for "municipal annexation to Seoul for Gwangmyeong" on the floor in September 2009,<ref>A news article.(in Korean) http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=100&oid=001&aid=0002855678</ref><ref>The original text of the proposed bill.(in Korean) http://www.ok100.or.kr/view.php?id=sub31&no=12 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402120011/http://www.ok100.or.kr/view.php?id=sub31&no=12 |date=2015-04-02 }}</ref> though his attempt turned out in vain at last. Opponents insist that the annexation would tarnish municipal [[autonomy]] in Gwangmyeong and it would also worsen balanced development of non-capital areas on the national level. The central government once proposed that Gwangmyeong be merged with [[Bucheon]] other than being annexed to Seoul.

== Education ==
There are nine high schools, ten middle schools, and 21 elementary schools in Gwangmyeong. Prior to 2013, middle school students who wished to go to high school had to take the entrance exam. Gwangmyeong-buk High School and Jinseong High School are traditionally well known for higher standards of students' academic ability.

=== Libraries ===
*Gwangmyeong Central Library (광명 중앙도서관 gwang-myeong-jung-ahng-do-seo-gwan)
*Cheolsan Library (철산 도서관 cheol-san-do-seo-gwan)
*HaAn Library (하안 도서관 ha-an-do-seo-gwan)

*Soha Library (소하도서관 so-ha-do-seo-gwan)
*Cheolsandong Library (철산동 연서 도서관 cheol-san-dong-yeon-seo-do-seo-gwan) Completed in June 2020

== Residential areas ==
Since Gwangmyeong is a [[commuter town]] bordering Seoul, it's mostly a residential area. The northwestern part of Gwangmyeong, namely Gwangmyeong-dong, is mostly composed of low-storeyed detached houses, while the eastern part, namely Cheolsan-dong and Haan-dong, consists of high-storeyed apartment complexes. Throughout the late 2000s, old public low-storeyed apartment complexes (저층 주공아파트 jeo-cheng ju-gong-ah-pa-teu) in Cheolsan-dong were rebuilt into private high-storeyed apartment complexes (고층 민간아파트 go-cheng min-gan-ah-pa-teu). In 2010, some parts of Soha-dong was developed to newly built public apartment complexes.

== Shopping ==
[[File:2015년 6월 29일 IKEA 광명점 외부 전경.jpg|thumb|One of the world's largest IKEA stores located near the [[KTX]] [[Gwangmyeong Station]] in the [[Seoul Capital Area]], [[South Korea]].]]
Gwangmyeong is home to one of the world's largest [[IKEA]] stores, with the second largest store located in [[Goyang]], and a large [[Lotte Department Store|Lotte]] Premium Outlet that is connected to the IKEA. The city is also home to a large [[Costco]] warehouse which also serves as the headquarters of Costco Korea. A large Korean-style traditional market, Gwangmyeong Market, is located in the Gwangmyeong crossroads with [[Gwangmyeongsageori Station]]. Modern shopping malls are in [[Cheolsan Station]], Haan crossroads, and Soha-dong ([[E-mart]] and [[Costco]]). Gwangmyeong residents can also use shopping malls ([[Lotte Mart]] and [[Homeplus]]) in nearby Guro-gu and Geumcheon-gu. Clothes outlets are located in nearby Gasan-dong in Seoul.

== Medical services ==
A local general hospital, Gwangmyeong Sungae Hospital is in Cheolsan-dong and it is recently affiliated with Medical School of [[Kwandong University]]. There are two university hospitals. One is [[Korea University Medical Center]] at Guro (구로고대병원 gu-ro-go-dae-byeong-weon) that is located in nearby Guro-dong, Seoul and other one is Chung-ang University Hospital at Gwangmyeong (중앙대학교광명병원 joong-ahng-dae-hak-gyo-gwang-myeong-byeong-weon) that is located near [[Gwangmyeong station]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://med.cau.ac.kr/site/homepage/menu/viewMenu.do?menuid=001005003 | title=중앙대학교 의과대학 의학전문대학원 }}</ref> A public medical centre is in southernmost Haan-dong.

Many private clinics are located along with business areas in the city.

== Climate ==
Gwangmyeong has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dwa''), but can be considered a borderline [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cwa'') using the {{convert|-3|C}} isotherm.
