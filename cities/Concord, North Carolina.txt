==History==
[[File:Old Hotel in Concord.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hotel Concord]]]]
Concord, located in today's rapidly growing northeast quadrant of the [[Charlotte metropolitan area]], was first settled about 1750 by German and [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] immigrants. The name Concord means "to bring into harmony".<ref>{{Cite web |title=concord (v.) |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/concord |access-date=2023-01-09 |website=etymonline.com}}</ref> This name was chosen after a lengthy dispute between the German Lutherans and Scotch-Irish Presbyterians over where the county seat should be located.<ref>{{Cite web |title=City of Concord NC > Visitor > Visitor Information > Historic Facts |url=https://concordnc.gov/Visitor/Visitor-Information/Historic-Facts#:~:text=A%20compromise%20was%20eventually%20reached,which%20the%20issue%20was%20settled. |access-date=2022-11-06 |website=concordnc.gov}}</ref> Concord is considered a relatively old town by US standards, as it was incorporated in 1806. Today, markers identifying the original town limits can be seen in the downtown area.

As county seat, Concord became a center of trade and retail for the cotton-producing region, especially on court days. The downtown would be crowded with farmers and townfolk, in addition to lawyers and their clients. During the antebellum era, wealth was built by planters through the cultivation of cotton as a commodity crop; the work was done by enslaved African Americans.

Based on wealth from cotton as a commodity crop and through textile manufacturing, Concord's white planters and business owners built some significant homes in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; they range along North and South Union Street and Edgewood Avenue.<ref name="Concord Historic District Handbook">{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.concord.nc.us/Departments/Planning/HistoricDistrictHandbook/tabid/462/Default.aspx|title=City of Concord > Departments > Planning > Planning Services > Historic Districts|website=www.ci.concord.nc.us|access-date=July 25, 2018|archive-date=April 24, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424203638/http://www.ci.concord.nc.us/Departments/Planning/HistoricDistrictHandbook/tabid/462/Default.aspx|url-status=dead}}</ref> Within the North Union Historic District is Memorial Garden. Located on {{convert|3|acre|m2}}, the garden winds through the 200-year-old cemetery of the First Presbyterian Church.

Located in the Piedmont, Concord became a site of industrialization with cotton mills in the late 19th century. Among the owners of the new mills in the area were men of the rising black middle-class in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], such as [[Warren Clay Coleman]], [[John C. Dancy]] (appointed as collector of customs at the port), and others, who organized [[Coleman Manufacturing Company]] in 1897. They built and operated what is believed to have been the first cotton mill owned by blacks in the nation.<ref name="edmonds">[[Helen G. Edmonds|Edmonds, Helen G.]] ''The Negro and Fusion Politics in North Carolina, 1894-1901'' (1951/reprint 2013) pp 89-92. Quote, p. 92: Dancy wrote: "This is the first genuine cotton mill yet built and controlled by colored men in the history of the country. It stands two miles from Concord, North Carolina, in the midst of a plot of about 140 acres of fertile soil. ...There is no good reason why there should not be a splendid town there governed by ourselves in the near future."</ref> They hoped to promote economic security for people of color. However, the [[Wilmington Insurrection of 1898]], with white attacks on black areas of the city, caused many deaths, as well as destroying homes and businesses built by blacks since the Civil War. In 1900, Dancy was among more than 2000 blacks who left the city permanently after the riot. He moved to Washington, DC, appointed as the federal Recorder of Deeds, and had served until 1910.<ref>Edmonds (1951/2013), "The Negro and Fusion Politics," p. 92</ref> The mill operated under black ownership through 1904, hitting difficult times after Coleman died. The brick mill building was later taken over by [[Fieldcrest Cannon]]. It was enlarged and added on to, nearly doubling its square footage.

From the time of incorporation in the late 1700s through the 1970s, Concord's jurisdiction was centered around the downtown area. Since then, most annexations have taken place west of the center-city area toward Charlotte.<ref name="City of Concord Planning Department">{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.concord.nc.us/Departments/Planning/tabid/154/Default.aspx|title=Planning & Community Development|website=www.ci.concord.nc.us|access-date=July 25, 2018|archive-date=April 20, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420073226/http://www.ci.concord.nc.us/Departments/Planning/tabid/154/Default.aspx|url-status=dead}}</ref> Portions of the city limit boundary adjoin the Cabarrus/Mecklenburg County line.

This program is designed to enhance the lives of residents in the neighborhoods in the city, increasing the quality of both life and events for those calling Concord home.

Through this effort, strong communication is established between city government and its citizens.  There are currently 45 neighborhoods participating in the program, which contributes to making Concord one of the most sought-after communities for homebuyers in the regional real estate market.
