'''Kingston''' is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] and largest city of [[Jamaica]], located on the southeastern coast of the island. It faces a natural [[harbour]] protected by the [[Palisadoes]], a long [[spit (landform)|sand spit]] which connects the town of [[Port Royal]] and the [[Norman Manley International Airport]] to the rest of the island. Kingston is the largest English-speaking city south of the [[United States]] in the [[Western Hemisphere]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2016-07-17 |title=Five Things You Didn't Know About Kingston, Jamaica |url=https://www.caribjournal.com/2016/07/16/five-things-you-didnt-know-about-kingston-jamaica/ |access-date=2022-06-21 |website=Caribbean Journal |language=en}}{{rs|date=December 2022}}</ref>

The local government bodies of the parishes of [[Kingston Parish|Kingston]] and [[Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica|Saint Andrew]] were amalgamated by the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation Act of 1923, to form the [[Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation]] (KSAC).

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Kingston, Jamaica}}
[[File:1882 Kingston Fire.png|thumb|Scenes in Kingston after the 1882 fire.]]
[[File:Map Kingston 1897.jpg|thumb|Map of Kingston, 1897]]

Kingston was founded on 22 July 1692,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Parish Profile: Kingston – Jamaica Information Service |url=https://jis.gov.jm/information/parish-profiles/parish-profile-kingston/ |access-date=2022-06-21 |website=jis.gov.jm}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite web |title=Kingston {{!}} national capital, Jamaica |url= https://www.britannica.com/place/Kingston-Jamaica |access-date=2022-06-21 |website= britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> shortly after the [[1692 Jamaica earthquake|1692 earthquake]] that devastated [[Port Royal]] in 1692; the original section of the city which was situated at the bottom of the Liguanea Plains was laid out to house survivors of that earthquake.<ref name=":2">{{cite book |last1=Greene |first1=Jack |title=Settler Jamaica in the 1750s |date=2016 |publisher=University of Virginia Press |pages=153}}</ref>

Before the earthquake, Kingston's functions were purely [[Agriculture|agricultural]].<ref name=":2" /> The earthquake survivors set up a camp on the sea front. Approximately two thousand people died due to [[mosquito-borne disease]]s. Initially the people lived in a tented camp on Colonel Barry's ''Hog Crawle''. The town did not begin to grow until after the further destruction of Port Royal by fire in 1703. Surveyor John Goffe drew up a plan for the town based on a grid bounded by North, East, West, and Harbour Streets. The new grid system of the town was designed to facilitate commerce, particularly the system of main thoroughfares {{convert|66|ft}} across, which allowed transportation between the port and plantations farther inland.<ref name="guardian">{{cite news |last1=Mann |first1=Emily |title=Kingston, Jamaica – a city born of 'wickedness' and disaster |url= https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/24/story-cities-9-kingston-jamaica-richest-wickedest-city-world |access-date=24 March 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> By 1716, it had become the largest town and the centre of trade for Jamaica. The government sold land to people with the regulation that they purchase no more than the amount of the land that they owned in Port Royal, and only land on the sea front. Gradually, wealthy merchants began to move their residences from above their businesses to the farm lands north on the plains of [[Liguanea]].<ref name=":2" /><ref name="guardian" />

The first free school, Wolmers's, was founded in 1729 and there was a theatre, first on Harbour Street and then moved in 1774 to North Parade.<ref name=":3">{{cite web| url=http://www.wolmers.net/boys/history.html|title=Wolmers's Boys School| website= wolmers.net|access-date=20 June 2017|archive-date=15 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215083907/http://www.wolmers.net/boys/history.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> Both are still in existence.<ref name=":3" /> In 1755 the [[List of Governors of Jamaica|governor]], [[Sir Charles Knowles, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Knowles]], had decided to transfer the government offices from [[Spanish Town]] to Kingston. It was thought by some to be an unsuitable location for the Assembly in proximity to the moral distractions of Kingston, and the next governor rescinded the Act. However, by 1780 the population of Kingston was 11,000, and the merchants began lobbying for the administrative capital to be transferred from Spanish Town, which was by then eclipsed by the commercial activity in Kingston.<ref name=":3" />

The Church of St. Thomas, on King Street, the chief thoroughfare, was first built before 1699 but was rebuilt after the earthquake in 1907.<ref name=":4" /> By the end of the 18th century, the city contained more than 3,000 brick buildings.<ref name=":5" /> The harbour fostered trade. It was involved in several naval wars of the 18th century. Kingston took over the functions of Spanish Town (the capital at the time). These functions included agriculture, commercial, processing and a main transport hub to and from Kingston and other sections of the island.<ref name=":5" />

In 1788, Kingston had a population of 25,000, which was about a tenth of the overall population of the island. One in every four people living in Kingston was white, but there was a large population of [[free people of color]] there too; two out of every five people living in Kingston were free. The remaining three-fifths of Kingston's population was made up of black slaves.<ref name=":5">Christer Petley, ''White Fury'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018), p. 38.</ref>

The government passed an act to transfer the government offices to Kingston from Spanish Town, which occurred in 1872.<ref name=":4"/> In 1882, there was a large fire in Kingston.<ref>{{Cite web |title=1882 |url=http://jamaica-history.weebly.com/1882.html |access-date=2022-06-21 |website=Jamaica's history  |language=en}}</ref> In 1892, electricity first came to Jamaica, when it was supplied to a coal-burning steam-generating plant on Gold Street in Kingston.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jpsco.com/our-history/ |title=Through the Years |website=jpsco.com |access-date=30 April 2022 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220310154903/https://www.jpsco.com/our-history/ |archive-date=Mar 10, 2022 }}</ref>

In the 1980 general elections, the [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] [[People's National Party]] (PNP) government was voted out, and subsequent governments have been more market-oriented and focused on tourism and relations with the United States, which reflected the "turbulent" and "volatile" era, in which Cuba and the United States fought for cultural control over Jamaica.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-11-15 |title=The 1980s Historian {{!}} Memories of turbulent and volatile Jamaica |url=https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/focus/20201115/1980s-historian-memories-turbulent-and-volatile-jamaica |access-date=2022-06-21 |website=Jamaica Gleaner |language=en}}</ref>

==Demographics==
The majority of the population of Kingston is of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African descent]]. Large minority ethnic groups include [[Indo-Jamaican|East Indians]] and Chinese, who came to the country as [[indentured servants]] in the late 19th century. The Chinese occupy important roles in Jamaica's economy especially in the retail markets in Downtown Kingston and the wider metropolitan area. There is also a minority of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]], mostly descending from immigrants from Germany and Great Britain. [[Syrians]] and [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] form one of the most influential ethnic groups in not only Kingston, but the entire island. Though a minority ethnic group, the [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] were able to give Jamaica one of its prime ministers, [[Edward Philip George Seaga]]. Multi-racial Jamaicans continue to form the second largest racial group, and there is also a small Jewish population in the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucija.org/visit.htm|title=Synagogue and Heritage Centre|access-date=30 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728141912/http://www.ucija.org/visit.htm |archive-date=28 July 2011}}

Kingston plays a central role in Jamaica's economy. The vast majority of economic activity takes place within Kingston, and as most government ministries are located in the city, it is a key force in legislation in regards to Jamaica's finances. The high population density of the capital city means that the majority of monetary transactions occur in Kingston – stimulating much of Jamaica's local economy.

==Geography and climate==
[[File:Kingston, Jamaica.JPG|thumb|Photo of Kingston taken from the [[International Space Station]]]]

Kingston is surrounded by the [[Blue Mountains (Jamaica)|Blue Mountains]], Red Hills, Long Mountain and the [[Kingston Harbour]], which is the seventh largest natural harbour in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Burton |first=Morgan |date=2024-01-19 |title=What is the 7th largest natural harbor in the world? |url=https://www.ncesc.com/geographic-faq/what-is-the-7th-largest-natural-harbor-in-the-world/ |access-date=2024-01-23 |website=Geographic FAQ Hub: Answers to Your Global Questions |language=en-US}}</ref> The city is on the [[Liguanea]] plain, an alluvial plain alongside the Hope River. Kingston experiences frequent earthquakes, including the 1907 earthquake.<ref name=":4" />

Kingston has a tropical climate, specifically a [[tropical savanna climate|tropical wet-and-dry climate]] (''Aw/As''), that borders on a hot [[semi-arid climate]] (''BSh''). characterised by a wet season from May to November, which coincides with the hurricane season, and a dry season from December to April. During the dry season, there is not much rainfall, however, cold and stationary fronts occur at this time, and often bring heavy showers, especially in March. Kingston is in the [[rain shadow]] of the Blue Mountains; therefore, little to none of the moisture carried by the Northeast [[Trade Winds]] falls over Kingston, causing Kingston to be very dry in comparison to [[Portland Parish, Jamaica|Portland]] and [[Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica|Saint Mary]] on the windward side of the Blue Mountains. Kingston is on a coastal location, hence it comes under the influence of the sea, though dense urban development can negate this effect. In the 21st century, Kingston has experienced temperatures as high as {{convert|38.8|°C|0}} and as low as {{convert|13.4|°C|0}}. Between 1895 and 1990, the total average rainfall was recorded at {{convert|813|mm|in|abbr=on}}, the highest monthly average rainfall recorded in October at {{convert|177|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the lowest monthly average rainfall recorded in March at {{convert|18|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=climate /> Fog, hail, thunder and tornadoes are all extremely rare.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://voodooskies.com/weather/jamaica/kingston/monthly/climate |title=Voodoo Skies – Kingston Monthly Climate weather history |last=VoodooSkies.com }}</ref>

== Housing ==
In 1848 the Jamaican government expanded Kingston by constructing new homes in the west, north and east of the city. This housing became highly segregated in terms of race and class and by 1860 the majority of white elites lived on the outskirts of the city.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://mappingkingston.wordpress.com/2012/08/18/urban-growth-and-town-expansion/|title=Urban Growth and Town Expansion|date=18 August 2012|website=Kingston, Jamaica|access-date=10 November 2016}}</ref>

As Kingston's population grew, existing settlements became so densely occupied that marshes in the southwest were filled in to allow the development of new housing. By 1935, continued population growth and poverty resulted in the emergence of slums in the east and west of the city. Later these areas were demolished by the government and residents were rehoused in [[Denham Town]]. This development accommodated 3,000 people, leaving more than one sixth of displaced resident homeless. Consequently, overcrowding persisted throughout the city; further, cramped living conditions resulted in public health issues.<ref name=":0" />

[[Suburbanization]] also became significant and by the 1960s this residential area spread to the foothills of the Blue Mountains. Subsequently, the lack of space and continued consumerism meant this area then expanded to the east of the mountains.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Clarke|first1=Colin|last2=Howard|first2=David|date=1 June 2006|title=Contradictory socio-economic consequences of structural adjustment in Kingston, Jamaica|journal=Geographical Journal|language=en|volume=172|issue=2|pages=106–129|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4959.2006.00197.x|bibcode=2006GeogJ.172..106C |issn=1475-4959}}</ref>

==Parks==

The city of Kingston is home to a number of urban parks which are frequently transformed to accommodate various events and festivities on the Jamaican calendar. The most popular parks include: Emancipation Park, Hope Gardens, Devon House, National Heroes' Park, [[St. William Grant|St William Grant Park]] and Mandela Park.

===Emancipation Park===
{{Main|Emancipation Park (Kingston, Jamaica)}}

The Liguanea Club, a recreational and social club for the upper class in society, located on Knutsford Boulevard, owned over {{convert|35|acres|0|abbr=on}} of land including the former Liguanea Park now the site of Emancipation Park. The club gave the land measuring seven acres as a gift to the Jamaican Government.
[[File:A_bust_of_Marcus_Garvey.jpg|thumb|A bust of Marcus Garvey in Emancipation Park]]
Several government members argued that the land should be converted into a business district, while others felt a multi-functional entertainment complex should be built on the site. The large financial input needed for either venture, was not forthcoming. In 2002 Cabinet granted approval for the transfer of the land to the National Housing Trust on the condition that a park was built and maintained at that location. The land was transferred for one Jamaican dollar.<ref>[http://www.emancipationpark.org.jm/about-us/history-of-emancipation-park.php] Official website of Emancipation Park</ref>

The park is well known for the 11&nbsp;ft. (approximately 3m) high bronze sculpture done by Jamaican artist Laura Facey, situated at the park's main entrance. This prominent sculpture comprises two naked black male and female statues gazing to the skies – symbolic of their triumphant rise from the horrors of slavery. The statue was unveiled in July 2003, in time for the park's first anniversary<ref>[http://www.emancipationpark.org.jm/about-us/facey-sings.php] Official website of Emancipation Park</ref> which caused an out cry from the Jamaican populace who believed that the blatant nudity and generous bodily proportions of the figures were very inappropriate to depict the freedom of black people.<ref>[http://www.jamaicatravelandculture.com/destinations/kingston/redemption-song-statue.htm] Jamaica Travel and Culture.com</ref>

===Hope Gardens===
The Royal Botanical Gardens at Hope, popularly called Hope Gardens serves as a national attraction. The Hope Gardens is a part of the {{convert|2000|acres|0|abbr=on}} of land making it the largest botanical garden in the English-speaking Caribbean. The land situated by the foothills of the Blue Mountains was originally owned by Major Richard Hope from whom it got its name. Two hundred acres of this land was obtained by the Government of Jamaica in 1880 and was originally established as a plant introduction and crop-testing facility for plants such as pineapple, cocoa, coffee and tobacco. The formal Botanical Gardens were laid out on approximately {{convert|60|acres|0|abbr=on}} of this land with the assistance of personnel from the Kew Gardens in England.

In the 1950s, the Queen, after visiting the island and being pleased with the state of the gardens, gave permission for it to be called the Royal Botanical Gardens, Hope. The Gardens have many exotic species along with some endemic trees of Jamaica. Over the years, the ravages of hurricanes and other disasters have resulted in the loss of a significant number of species. However, there are still some prominent trees and popular sites to be viewed in the Gardens. At Hope Gardens, visitors can view a number of other features including the Coconut Museum, the Sunken Gardens, the Orchid House, the Lily Pond, the Maze and Palm Avenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitjamaica.com/activities/royal-botanical-gardens.aspx |title=Hope Royal Botanical Gardens, Kingston |website=Visitjamaica.com |access-date=13 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718133245/http://www.visitjamaica.com/activities/royal-botanical-gardens.aspx |archive-date=18 July 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://jamaicachm.org.jm/PDF/February2008.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://jamaicachm.org.jm/PDF/February2008.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |title=The Royal Botanic Gardens of Hope - contributing to Jamaica's plant diversity |first1=Lois A.

The gardens and zoo are undergoing redevelopment to improve the physical landscape and the animal inventory as a part of Bring Back The Hope campaign.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.jamaicaobserver.com/business/Robert-Lalor-appointed-CEO-of-Nature-Preservation-Foundation_8732757 |title=Robert Lalor appointed CEO of Nature Preservation Foundation - Business|website= JamaicaObserver.com |publisher= |date=1 May 2011 |access-date=13 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330052057/http://m.jamaicaobserver.com/business/Robert-Lalor-appointed-CEO-of-Nature-Preservation-Foundation_8732757 |archive-date=30 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Transport==

===Road===
The [[St. William Grant|St William Grant Park]] (Parade) in the heart of downtown Kingston is the starting point for three of [[A2 road (Jamaica)|Jamaica's four A roads]], namely the A1 (Kingston to [[Lucea, Jamaica|Lucea]]), the A3 (Kingston to [[Saint Ann's Bay]]) and the A4 (Kingston to [[Annotto Bay]]), while the city itself is provided with a dense network of trunk, main, secondary and minor roads. It also consists of the [[Highway 2000, Jamaica]] which runs through [[Portmore, Jamaica|Portmore]], [[Ocho Rios]] and [[Mandeville, Jamaica|Mandeville]]. A new section of [[Highway 2000, Jamaica]] (called "T3") was recently opened to the public. It has greatly reduced the travel time between Kingston and Montego Bay from 4 hours to a mere {{frac|2|1|2}} hours.

Kingston is served well by a modern bus system, mini buses and taxis, which operate throughout the city with major hubs at  Parade, [[Cross Roads, Jamaica|Cross Roads]], [[Half Way Tree]] and elsewhere.<ref name="autogenerated66">[http://www.mtw.gov.jm/general_information/reports/TransportStatisticsReport2003_2004.pdf Table 3.12 (PDF page 66) ff.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315174612/http://www.mtw.gov.jm/general_information/reports/TransportStatisticsReport2003_2004.pdf |date=15 March 2013 }}, Annual Transport Statistics Report: Jamaica in Figures 2003–2004, Jamaica Ministry of Transport and Works.</ref>

===Buses===
In June 1898, the existing mule car service was phased out and a transition to electric trams, initially operated by the West India Electric Company and later by the Jamaica Public Service Company, was undertaken.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Jamaica Public Service Company Limited |url=http://www.myjpsco.com/about_us/our_history.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507143804/http://www.myjpsco.com/about_us/our_history.php |archive-date=7 May 2012 }}</ref> This transition to the electric tram was completed on 31 March 1899. This service continued to operate, but the inflexibility of a tram service could not keep pace with a growing city, and the tram service ceased to operate on 7 August 1948.<ref>"Last Trams", ''The Daily Gleaner'', 7 August 1948.</ref>

Between 1948 and 1953, a motor bus service was operated by a company called Jamaica Utilities. The government revoked its franchise in 1953.

From 1953 to 1983, the [[Jamaica Omnibus Service]] operated a service, which at its peak consisted of over 600 buses and served an area spanning Spanish Town, Border, Mt. James, Bull Bay and Port Royal. It was wound up by the government in 1983 after being nationalised in 1974.

Kingston is served well by a modern bus system, the [[Jamaica Urban Transit Company]] (JUTC), mini buses, and taxis, which operate throughout the city with major hubs at  Parade, [[Cross Roads, Jamaica|Cross Roads]], [[Half Way Tree]] and elsewhere.<ref name="autogenerated66"/>

===Rail===
The now disused [[Kingston railway station, Jamaica|Kingston railway station]] served the [[Railways of Jamaica: Kingston to Montego Bay|Kingston to Montego Bay]] main line with branches from [[Railways of Jamaica: Spanish Town to Ewarton|Spanish Town to Ewarton]], [[Railways of Jamaica: Bog Walk to Port Antonio|Bog Walk to Port Antonio]], [[Railways of Jamaica: Linstead to New Works|Linstead to New Works]] and [[Railways of Jamaica: May Pen to Frankfield|May pen to Frankfield]].

The railway station opened in 1845 and closed in October 1992 when all passenger traffic on Jamaica's railways abruptly ceased.<ref name="JTH18">[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3884/is_200303/ai_n9209497/pg_18 The rise and fall of railways in Jamaica, 1845–1975 – Pg18] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425135205/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3884/is_200303/ai_n9209497/pg_18/ |date=25 April 2009 }}, ''Journal of Transport History'', March 2003.</ref>

===Air===
Kingston's international airport is the [[Norman Manley International Airport]], while [[Tinson Pen Aerodrome]] in Kingston provides domestic services.

===Sea===
Historically, the Kingston waterfront was Jamaica's main port with many [[Pier#Working piers|finger piers]] at which freighters and passenger liners could dock. More recently, with the [[containerisation]] of freight, the port has moved to Newport West.

==Law enforcement==
Jamaica's police force, the [[Jamaica Constabulary Force]], is based on Old Hope Road near [[Liguanea]]. Smaller police stations, such as Hunt's Bay, Matilda's Corner and Half-Way-Tree, are dispersed across the Corporate Area. The Supreme Court of Jamaica is also located in Kingston. Other courts, such as the Half-Way-Tree Resident Magistrate's Court, [[Gun Court]], Traffic Court and Family Court, make Kingston their home. The [[Jamaica Defence Force]] (JDF) has its headquarters at [[Up Park Camp]] near New Kingston and Cross Roads. The JDF also operates a major naval base at Port Royal.

Crime rates are high in and around Kingston and [[Montego Bay]], and include gang violence and shootings in inner city areas. The highest-crime areas include West Kingston, Grants Pen, August Town, Harbour View and Spanish Town.<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/jamaica/safety-and-security Foreign travel advice: Jamaica] UK Government</ref>

===Fire service===
Fire response in Kingston is provided by the [[Jamaica Fire Brigade]], the national fire service. The service operates from fire stations spread throughout the Corporate Area. Fire stations are located at<ref>{{cite web|title=Jamaica Fire Brigade |url=http://www.jamaicafirebrigade.org/stat.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620121015/http://www.jamaicafirebrigade.org/stat.html |archive-date=20 June 2009 }}</ref>

Mobile voice and broadband services in Kingston are dominated by incumbents, [[Flow (brand)|FLOW]] and [[Digicel]]. Both carriers provide GSM, EDGE, HSPA, HSPA+ and LTE connectivity in and around the city.

FLOW offers HSPA+ of up to 21&nbsp;Mbit/s on 850&nbsp;MHz and 1900&nbsp;MHz. FLOW also offers [[DC-HSDPA]] (commonly known as DC-HSPA+) allowing capable devices speeds of up to 42&nbsp;Mbit/s on contiguous 1900&nbsp;MHz spectrum.

Digicel also offers 21&nbsp;Mbit/s HSPA+ however, they also offer [[DC-HSDPA]] (commonly known as DC-HSPA+) allowing capable devices speeds of up to 42&nbsp;Mbit/s on contiguous 850&nbsp;MHz spectrum. Digicel was also first to market with LTE in Jamaica. Their network covers all of Kingston Parish and most of the populous areas in the Kingston Metropolitan Area, capable of speeds of up to 75&nbsp;Mbit/s on 10&nbsp;MHz of Band 17 spectrum.

FLOW also offers LTE in Kingston.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegeography.com/products/commsupdate/articles/2016/01/18/flow-jamaica-begins-4g-deployment/|title=FLOW Jamaica begins 4G deployment|last=TeleGeography|website=Comms Update|date=18 January 2016|access-date=25 April 2016|archive-date=28 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128220037/https://www.telegeography.com/products/commsupdate/articles/2016/01/18/flow-jamaica-begins-4g-deployment/|url-status=dead}}</ref> FLOW's LTE network is accessible on Band 4 or AWS spectrum. Due to the network delaying its rollout to acquire more spectrum, its network is theoretically faster than both Digicel and Caricel, to the tune of 150&nbsp;Mbit/s (20&nbsp;MHz of Bandwidth)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/business/20160726/flow-jamaica-applies-lte-spectrum-high-speed-internet|title=FLOW Jamaica applies for LTE spectrum for high speed Internet|newspaper=The Gleaner|first=Steven|last= Jackson|date=2016-07-27}}</ref> with further plans to add low band spectrum, possibly increasing theoretical speeds up to 225&nbsp;Mbit/s.

Kingston is also home to [[Caricel]], Jamaica's newest telecoms operator, which deployed its LTE network first to the Kingston Metropolitan Area.

In addition, both carriers have their Jamaican head offices in the city (with the exception of Digicel, which has its company headquarters in Kingston rather than a regional office there as is the case with FLOW, which is based in [[Miami]]).
