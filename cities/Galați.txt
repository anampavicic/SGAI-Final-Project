==Etymology and names==
The name ''Galați'' is derived from the [[Cuman language|Cuman]] word {{lang|qwm|galat}}. This word is ultimately borrowed from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word {{lang|fa|کلات}} [[Qila|{{transl|fa|kalat}}]], "fortress". Other [[etymology|etymologies]] have been suggested, such as the [[Serbian language|Serbian]] {{lang|sr|galac}}. However, the ''galat'' root appears in nearby toponyms, some of which show clearly a Cuman origin, for example '''Gălățui Lake''', which has the typical Cuman -''ui'' suffix for "water". Another toponym in the region is [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], with its town of [[Halych]], locally associated with the [[jackdaw]] (Kawka, Halka). Before the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasion of Rus]], Galați was known as Malyi Halych (Little Halych) as part of the [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]].<ref>Arkas, M. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=GERpAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA78 Istorii︠a︡ Ukraïny-Rusi]''. [History of Ukraine-Ruthenia]. "Obshchestvennaia Polza" Publishing. 1908.</ref><ref>Paliy, O.

Galați has several [[exonyms]]: {{langx|el|Γαλάτσι|Galátsi}}; {{langx|de|Galatz}} (also an archaic English term); {{langx|hu|Galac}}; {{langx|pl|Gałacz}}; {{langx|tr|Kalas}}; {{langx|bg|Галац|Galac}}; {{langx|uk|Галац|Halac}}; and {{langx|ru|Галац|Galac}}.

===Ancient origins===
Archeological evidence points to occupation of the region in the [[neolithic]] period. For example, north west of the town of Galați, on the eastern shores of the Malina marshes, fragments of ceramic-type Stoicani Aldeni, stilex and tools made of bone have been found. A stone sceptre, from the late Bronze Age, belonging to the Coslogeni culture was found on the marshes' southern bank. Galați town itself developed from an ancient [[Dacia]]n settlement of the sixth and fifth centuries BCE where there was a ford across the [[Danube]] river. In 101 to 102 and 105 to 106, the [[Dacians]] fought wars against the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and the area became part of the Roman empire. A [[Castra of Tirighina-Bărboși|strong Roman fortress]] was built at Barboși to defend the ford across Danube. From the 300s a Daco-Roman settlement developed at a ford south of the site of the Church of the Virgin.

===Medieval period===
There is evidence of continuous inhabitation of Galați since the 600s. A treasure hoard consisting of 12 silver coins issued between 613 and 685 was found in a [[Byzantine]] tomb near the Church of the Virgin. Western and Byzantine coins from the time of Emperor Michael IV (1034–1041) were also found. At one time {{when|date=November 2013}}, the city became part of the [[Republic of Genoa|Republic of Genoa Territories]] and was called "Caladda".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Repubblica_di_Genova.png|title=Map of Repubblica di Genova.}}</ref> In 1445, a document signed by [[Stephen II of Moldavia]] mentions Galați. In 1484, [[Kiliya, Ukraine|Chilia]] was conquered by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. Galați township remained [[Moldavia|Moldova's]] only port, not only for domestic trade but also for trade with Turkey and Poland. In 1590, the Galați Jewish cemetery was opened.

===18th century===
[[File:Erminy and von Saar - Moldau, Stadt Gallatz 2.jpg|thumb|Galați in 1826]]

====Burial of Hetman Mazeppa====
The Ukrainian folk hero, Ivan Stepanovich [[Ivan Mazepa|Mazeppa]] was a [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Hetman]] who died on 1709 in [[Varniţa, Anenii Noi|Varniţa]], [[Bessarabia]], and was buried in Galați.  Hetman Mazeppa was buried in a brick [[burial vault (tomb)|tomb]].

====Battle of Stănilești====
In 1710, Tatars plundered Galați after the [[Pruth River Campaign|Battle of Stănilești]].

====Russo-Turkish war====
In 1775, Russia established a consulate in Galați. However, in 1789, during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–92)|Russo-Turkish war]] of 1787–92, Galați was burned by the armies of the Russian general [[Mikhail Kamensky]].

===19th century===
In 1812, following the annexation by Russia of half of the principality, including all of the sea shore and almost all of Danube, Galati ended up as the principality's only port.

Due to unrest in this part of Europe, Galați port became a site for the construction of large warships. Abbot Boskov, a Romanian traveller, stated:
:"I saw a large boat, the way those who say Turks caravels, which is on site, ready to be launched into the water. He was commissioned by Isaac-aga, big tax collector of Constantinople. The ship was huge, seventeen seventy steps, and loaded with eighty-four bronze cannons."

====Massacre of 1821====
In the Greek–Turkish war of 1821, Ottoman subjects were killed in Galați (and in other towns). This was the result of a series of rebellions by members of the port workers' association and city clerks. {{clarify|date=April 2012}} {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

====Growth through trade====
Despite the wars and unrest, Galați developed based on trade (especially grain exports). In 1805, France and England established vice-consulates. In 1832, the School of the Holy Archangels Michael and Gabriel is founded. Two years later, in 1834, Austrian ships were having scheduled arrivals and in 1837, Galați was declared a free port (this was revoked in 1882). In 1850, [[James Buchanan]], the U.S. president, sent a vice-consul to Galați and the U.S. opened a consulate in 1858. Galați was also a trading port for German lands. When the [[Crimean War]] (1854–1856) finished, Galați became a seat of the [[Commissions of the Danube River|Danube European Commission]]. In 1869, the Mihai Eminescu municipal park opened and by 1870, factories were opening. By, 1908 they numbered 41. On 13 September 1872, the King Charles I railway station and northern city rail tunnel opened. The River station opened shortly after on 24 September 1880. In 1889, the V. A. Urechia library opened.

====Growth through unity====
After the [[United Principalities|union of the Romanian principalities]] in 1859, with [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] as [[domnitor|leader]], development in Galați increased. Zeletin wrote,
:"The birth of the modern Romanian state must distinguish two main currents – one exuberant but superficial, based on liberal ideas which depart from Paris to Bucharest and Iași. The other is quieter but deep, leaving from London to Galați and Brăila: English is the current capitalist economy." (''Romanian Bourgeoisie'', Zeletin, Stephen.) {{Page needed|date=December 2022}}

===1900–1947===
[[File:Str. Domneasca.jpg|thumb|left|Domnească Street, 1905]]
Between 1900 and the beginning of [[World War I]], Galați continued its trade in grain and timber with sixteen consulates. Galați was part of [[Counties of Romania|Covurlui County]].

In 1907, social unrest among the peasant classes precipitated intervention by the Romanian army. In 1911, a statue of the poet [[Mihai Eminescu]] was erected.

====World War I====
{{main|Battle of Galați}}
Galați remained under Romanian control during [[Romania during World War I|World War I]]. Romanian soldiers fought alongside those of Russia against the army of the [[Central Powers]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Galați was [[Battle of Galați|bombed by retreating Russian troops]] in January 1918.<ref name=Stoica1>{{cite book|last=Stoica|first=Vasile|title=The Roumanian Question: The Roumanians and their Lands|year=1919|publisher=Pittsburgh Printing Company|location=Pittsburgh|page=88|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7314/view/1/88/}}</ref>

====Interwar period====
In 1919, a high school for Jewish students opened. A first air race between Galați and Bucharest was held in 1926 following the end of the construction of the [[Galați Airport]]. The 1930 Romanian census recorded 100,000 residents in Galați. After [[Bucharest]], [[Chișinău]], [[Iași]] and [[Chernivtsi|Cernăuți]], Galați was Romania's fifth city. In 1938, the [[Ținutul Dunării|Ținutul Dunării de Jos]] (Lower Danube Land) was established.

====World war II====
During [[Romania in World War II|World War II]], Galați was bombed by the [[Soviet Air Forces]] and [[Luftwaffe]]. The railway station, inaugurated on 13 September 1872, was destroyed as were many other historic buildings and most of the old town. On 27 August 1944, Galați was captured by [[Red Army|Soviet]] troops of the [[3rd Ukrainian Front]] in the course of the [[Second Jassy–Kishinev Offensive|Jassy–Kishinev Offensive]].

====Jewish community====
Before World War II Galați hosted 22 synagogues and in 1926, it was the base for the Zionist Revisionist Organization of Romania. Although Galați's Jewish community suffered persecution by the pro-Nazi authorities during World War II, the community was not destroyed in the Holocaust. Since the 1940s the community has gradually diminished through emigration.

===Communist period (1947–1989)===

====Post war rebuilding====
After World War II, Galați was rebuilt along communist lines. The town's population was about 80,000. In 1956, a proposal to join Brăila and Galați was made and the building of a speed tram pier was proposed with a Swiss company. The plans never materialized. In 1958, the Galați Airport was abolished. Construction of the [[Galați steel works]] began in 1960 and the plant opened in 1966. The population at this time was 151,000. In 1971, the [[Făurei]] – Galați railway capacity was increased, and, in 1982, it was electrified.

====Mogoșoaia boating tragedy====
On September 11, 1989, a Bulgarian ship collided with a cruise ship near Galați. 151 passengers and crew died  (all but sixteen).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jurnalul.ro/croaziera-jurnalul/mogosoaia-mormantul-din-dunare-10068.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130416104743/http://www.jurnalul.ro/croaziera-jurnalul/mogosoaia-mormantul-din-dunare-10068.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 16, 2013|title="Mogosoaia" - mormantul din Dunare}}</ref><ref>[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-09-11-mn-1478-story.html] "Ships crash on Danube" Associated Press. 11 September 1989.

===Contemporary period===
In 2004, Romania's first information technology park opened in Galați.

====2005 flood====
On 14 July 2005, Galați was affected by widespread flooding. The Siret river reached record levels and across Romania, the death toll reached 21.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adrc.asia/latestinfo/View_E.php?lang=en&KEY=852|title=ADRC DisasterReport|website=www.adrc.asia}}</ref> In 2010, broken flood barriers caused flooding of the Valley City area of Galați.

==Geography==
[[File:FerryDanubeGalati20060716.jpg|thumb|Over the Danube]]

===Topography===
Galați is located in southeastern Romania. Its coordinates are latitude 45 ° 27 'north and longitude 28 ° 02' east. Its area is {{convert|246.4|km2|sp=us}}. Galați lies in the southern part of the [[Moldavian Plateau]] on the left (west) bank of the Danube river at the junction of the [[Siret River]] (west) and the [[Prut|Prut River]] (east), near Lake Brates. It is {{convert|80|km|mi|sp=us}} from the [[Black Sea]]. The nearest town is [[Brăila]], {{convert|15|km|mi|sp=us}} to the south. Galați is built on three geological terraces. One lies beneath "Valley City", with elevations between {{convert|5|and|7|m}}. The other two, which make a fan shape, have elevations of {{convert|20|–|25|m|sp=us}} (the site of the old town, now the city centre) and {{convert|40|m|sp=us}} (the site of the modern city) respectively.
The Danube river is considered the "life-blood" of Galați. The Danube is the second longest river in Europe {{convert|2850|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=x}}), with an average flow of {{convert|6199|m3|cuft|sp=us}} per second in the Galați section. After the Siret River, the largest tributary in Romania, joins the Danube, the flow is {{convert|210|m3/s|cuft/s|sp=us}}. After the Prut River joins the Danube, the flow becomes {{convert|86|m3/s|cuft/s|sp=us}}. The Danube river flows have significant seasonal variation. The maximum flows occur in May; {{convert|18000|–|19000|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on|disp=or}}. The minimum flows occur during the summer; {{convert|2000|–|2450|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on|disp=or}}.

===Climate===
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Galați falls within either a [[hot-summer humid continental climate]] (''Dfa'') if the {{convert|0|°C}} isotherm is used or a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') if the {{convert|-3|°C}} isotherm is used. Galați experiences four distinct seasons.

===Places of interest===

====Roman camp at Tirighina-Barbosi====
{{Main|Castra of Tirighina-Bărboși}}
From 1959 to 1962, archeological excavations were carried out at the Roman castellum in Barbosi. The site lies north of the Danube, near the mouth of the Siret. A comparison can be made to the fortress at [[Dinogetia]]. The archeologists found clear stratigraphy in the excavation. They located the Tirighina Dacian fortress, reinforced by an earthen bank. Finds included Dacian pottery from an import business. Also found was a silver coin dating the Dacian fortress to the first century BCE. A burning layer suggested damage to the fortress by fire.  Also found were coins dating from the rule of [[Augustus]](63 BCE – 14 AD) through to [[Nero]] (37AD – 68AD).

====Lambrinidi House====
[[File:GL-II-m-B-03014 Casa Lambrinidi.JPG|thumb|left|Lambrinidi House]]
[[File:Navigationpalace1.jpg|thumb|Navigation Palace]]
The Lambrinidi House is located near the university, at 51 Royal Street. It was built by Lambrinidi Epaminonda, a Greek mill owner. He owned a machine shop to repair ships. The Prince Charles stayed at the house on a visit to Galați, in April 1879. It has served as the seat of the Court of Appeals; the Mihail Kogalniceanu High School and, after the earthquake of November 9, 1940, the city hall.

====Robescu House====
The Robescu House was built about 1896. The architect was [[Ion Mincu]]. A Romanian tourist website describes the building: :"Robescu House has an elevated basement, two levels with two turret-balcony on the first floor and another balcony at the ground floor, to the street. The exterior decorations are made in Brancoveanu style, glossy ceramic plates. The glossy ceramic is used to decorate the floral upper register.
Today it serves as the "Children's Palace".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romguide.net/Visit/Robescu-House_vt12e|title=Robescu House, Galati, Romguide tourism Romania|website=www.romguide.net|access-date=2019-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235243/http://www.romguide.net/Visit/Robescu-House_vt12e|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Places of worship===
[[File:Galati cathedral.jpg|thumb|St. Andrew and St. Nicholas Orthodox Cathedral of the archbishop of the Lower Danube]]

====Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Lower Danube====
The cornerstone of the {{ill|Galați Orthodox Cathedral|ro|Catedrala arhiepiscopală din Galați}} was placed on 27 April 1906 by the [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Crown Prince Ferdinand]] and [[Marie of Romania|Princess Marie]]. Also present was the Bishop of the Lower Danube, {{ill|Pimen Georgescu|ro}}. Construction continued from 1906 to 1917. The architects were Petre Antonescu and {{ill|Ștefan Burcuș|ro}}. The church has one dome and no side isles. From 1989, restoration work has been underway at the church.

[[File:Biserica Fortificata Precista Galati.jpg|thumb|left|Precista fortified church]]
This is the oldest building in Galați. It was consecrated as a place of worship in September 1647 during the reign of [[Vasile Lupu]]. The church was dedicated to the [[Vatopedi Monastery]] on [[Mount Athos]]. It was built from local materials including stone, forest wood, brick and lime, sand from the beaches of the Danube and so on.

It was restored in the period 1991–1994. There may be a tunnel from the church beneath the Danube.

====Bulgarian Church====
[[File:Bulgarian church Galati.jpg|thumbnail|The Bulgarian Church in Galați]]
Construction of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church of [[Saint Pantaleon]] began in 1861 under the guidance of [[Bulgarian National Revival]] figure Archimandrite [[Maxim Raykovich]] (1801–1874) of [[Dryanovo]]. However, the lack of funds prolonged the construction works and the church was only consecrated in 1887. The Bulgarian Church of Saint Pantaleon features a [[Neo-Byzantine]] design with Slavic influences.<ref name="cilinca">{{cite web|url=http://www.viata-libera.ro/vlg-cultura/68475-comori-de-patrimoniu-biserica-sf-pantelimon-,-o-atlantida-bulgareasca-pe-o-insula-a-libertatii|title="Comori de patrimoniu": Biserica "Sf.

Along with the church, Raykovich also founded a Bulgarian school which occupied an adjacent house. The same house would become a hub for Bulgarian revolutionaries persecuted by the Ottoman authorities. In 1871–72, Bulgaria's national poet [[Hristo Botev]] lived in the house during a part of his exile, as a commemorative plaque still reminds.<ref name="cilinca"/>

====Church Mavromol====
Mavromol is a former monastery. Its name means "black rock" in Greek. It was built in 1669 and dedicated to the Assumption by [[George Ducas]] (died 1685) and his son.

Interior murals and other valuable elements were restored between 1973 and 1975.
The monks of the church taught at Galați's first school in 1765. They taught in Greek. (In 1803, teaching was conducted in Romanian under the orders of Constantin Moruz). During the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774), and the Russo-Austrian-Turkish War (1787–1792), Mavromol church was damaged and teaching ceased until 1803.
The church is constructed in the style of a [[basilica]] with [[apse]]s beyond the main walls. The church has a carved wooden icon of the "Virgin Mary" from the church of [[Saint Sava National College|St. Sava Monastery]] in Bucharest. The ceiling is composed of three parts separated by double arches. The entrance is on the south side through a door marked by an icon and heraldic symbols: a bull's head and two lions. Also on the south side is the coat of arms of Moldova, carved in a stone medallion. During communist rule, the church, as a sacred place, was improperly appropriated.
