==History==
Suq al-Shuyukh was founded in the early 18th century to serve as the [[suq]] (i.e. marketplace) of the [[Muntafiq]] tribal confederation.<ref name="Kramers 1997"/> The leader of the entire Muntafiq confederation resided at [[Kut al-Shuyukh]], four hours to the east.<ref name="Kramers 1997"/> The name "Shuyukh" refers to the members of his clan.<ref name="Kramers 1997"/>

Toward the end of the 18th century, Suq al-Shuyukh was "a small town with a mosque and surrounded by earthen walls".<ref name="Kramers 1997"/> In the early 1800s, the town was described as "extremely dirty", and the Muntafiq's shaykh "disdained to live in the town".<ref name="Kramers 1997"/> According to contemporary accounts, it was inhabited by 6,000 families and was a center for commercial exchange with [[Basra]] and even [[Bushir]] and [[Bombay]].<ref name="Kramers 1997"/>

During the 1800s, the town of Suq al-Shuyukh was separated into Muslim, Christian, Jewish, and Mandaean quarters, as reported during [[Julius Heinrich Petermann]]'s 1854 visit to the town.<ref>Petermann, Heinrich. ''Reisen in Orient''. Vols. 1–2. Leipzig: Von Veit and Co., 1865.</ref> The [[Mandaeans|Mandaean]] quarter was known as Margab<ref>{{cite journal|last=Buckley|first=Jorunn Jacobsen|title=Glimpses of A Life: Yahia Bihram, Mandaean priest|journal=History of Religions|volume=39|year=1999|pages=32–49|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/463572|doi=10.1086/463572}}</ref> or Ṣubbūye<ref name="Kramers 1997"/> and was located on the opposite bank of the Euphrates.<ref name="Kramers 1997"/> Petermann's visit came shortly after a mass emigration of the town's Mandaean population around 1853: before, there had been about 260 Mandaean families, many of them serving as silversmiths or boat-builders, but 200 of them had relocated to [[al-Amarah]] due to persecution by the Muntafiq.<ref name="Kramers 1997"/> Petermann estimated the town's population to be 3,000.<ref name="Kramers 1997"/> By this point, the shaykh owned a house in the town.<ref name="Kramers 1997"/> During his visit, Petermann met with Shaykh [[Yahya Bihram]], the high priest of the Mandaeans.<ref name="Kramers 1997"/>

Around the end of the 19th century, V. Cuinet listed Suq al-Shuyukh's population at about 12,000.<ref name="Kramers 1997"/> This included some 2,250 Sunnis, who had two mosques (''[[congregational mosque|jami's]]''); 8,770 Shi'is, who had one "sanctuary" (''masjid''); 200 Jews; and 700 Mandaeans.<ref name="Kramers 1997"/>

Under Ottoman rule, Suq al-Shuyukh was made the seat of a ''[[kaza]]'' in the ''[[sanjak]]'' of [[Muntafiq Sanjak|Muntafiq]].<ref name="Kramers 1997"/> It was later involved in the [[Iraqi revolt of 1920]] as well as the [[1935-1936 Iraqi Shia revolts]].<ref name="Kramers 1997"/>
