'''Subotica''' ({{langx|sr|Суботица}}, {{IPA|sh|sǔbotitsa|pron|Sr-Subotica.oga}}; {{langx|hu|Szabadka}}, {{langx|rue|Суботица}}, {{langx|ro|Subotița}}) is a [[List of cities in Serbia|city]] and the administrative center of the [[North Bačka District]] in the autonomous province of [[Vojvodina]], [[Serbia]]. Formerly the largest city of Vojvodina region, contemporary Subotica is now the second largest city in the province, following the city of [[Novi Sad]]. According to the 2022 census, the city itself has a population of 94,228, and the population of metro area (the administrative area of the city) stands at 123,952 people.<ref name=Census/>

It is the origin of the current Hungarian name for the city ''"Szabadka"''.<ref name="discoverserbia.org"/> According to [[Petar Skok|Skok]], Szabadka originated from ''sobotka'', a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] [[diminutive]] of ''sobota'', meaning "a place that had a market fair on Saturday" (like [[Szombathely]] or [[Nagyszombat]]), but its ending ''-ka'' was later replaced with ''-ica'', another Slavic diminutive, by the [[Bunjevci]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Skok | first=Petar | title=Etimologijski rječnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika | publisher=JAZU, Zagreb | year=1972 | volume=3 | page=299}}</ref> Other sources claim that the name "Szabadka" comes from the adjective szabad, which derived from the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] word for "free" – svobod, referring to the status of the colonists settled in this zone by the Habsburg after the [[Battle of Zenta]].<ref>[https://archivum.arhivvojvodine.org.rs/review-czardas-carved-into-building-material-the-synagoguein-subotica/ Colonists settling the military buffer zone between the Habsburg and Ottoman Empires] Retrieved 8 September 2022.</ref>

The town was named in the 1740s after [[Maria Theresa of Austria]], Archduchess of Austria. It was officially called ''Sent-Maria'' in 1743, but was renamed in 1779 as ''Maria-Theresiapolis''. These two official names were also spelled in several different ways (most commonly the [[German language|German]] ''Maria-Theresiopel'' or ''Theresiopel''), and were used in different languages.<ref name="hist"/>

===Prehistory and antiquity===
In the [[Neolithic]] and [[Eneolithic]] periods, several important archaeological cultures flourished in this area, including the [[Starčevo culture]],<ref>[https://archive.today/20130215124222/http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~hjohnson/New%20Index/Family%20Groups/Group%20Leaders%20Pages/Pin%20Oak%20Reports/inthebeginningupdated2009_files/image010.jpg Starčevo culture]</ref> the [[Vinča culture]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.catyline.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Vincanska_civilizacija_5300-3500_g.p.n.jpg |title= Map |website= catyline.com}}</ref> and the [[Tiszapolgár culture]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.rastko.rs/arheologija/ntasic-eneolit.html |title= [Projekat Rastko] Nikola Tasic: Eneolitske kulture centralnog i zapadnog Balkana|website= www.rastko.rs}}</ref> Early [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] peoples settled in the territory of present-day Subotica in 3200 BC.<ref>[https://www.thearchaeologist.org/blog/category/Eurasian+Steppe The first Indo-Europeans in the Balkans] Retrieved 8 September 2022.</ref> During the [[Eneolithic]] period, the [[Bronze Age]] and the [[Iron Age]], several Indo-European archaeological cultures included areas around Subotica - the [[Baden culture]], the [[Vučedol culture]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://files.myopera.com/edwardpiercy/blog/Area-Culture-Map-1.JPG |title= Area Culture Map 1 |access-date= 2011-02-12 |url-status = dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110714143416/http://files.myopera.com/edwardpiercy/blog/Area-Culture-Map-1.JPG |archive-date=2011-07-14 }},</ref> the [[Urnfield culture]]<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.eliznik.org.uk/EastEurope/History/balkans-map/middle-bronze.htm|title=South East Europe history - 1,800 BC map|last=eliznik|website=www.eliznik.org.uk|access-date=2013-01-14|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130325033312/http://www.eliznik.org.uk/EastEurope/History/balkans-map/middle-bronze.htm|archive-date= 2013-03-25|url-status = dead}}</ref> and some others. Before the [[Iazyges|Iazyge]] conquest in the 1st century BC, Indo-European peoples of [[Illyrians|Illyrian]], [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Dacians|Dacian]] descent inhabited this area. In the 3rd century BC, this area was controlled by the Celtic [[Boii]] and [[Eravisci]], while in the 1st century BC, it became part of the [[Dacian kingdom]]. From the 1st century BC, the area came under the control of the [[Sarmatian]] [[Iazyges]], who were sometimes allies and sometimes enemies of the [[Roman Empire|Romans]]. Iazyge rule lasted until the 4th century AD, after which the region came into the possession of various other peoples and states.{{sfn|Bârcă|2013|p=104}}

===Early Middle Ages and Slavic settlement===
In the Early Middle Ages various [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and [[Turkic peoples]] and states ruled in the area of Subotica. These peoples included [[Huns]], [[Gepids]], [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], [[Slavs]] and [[Bulgarians]]. [[Slavs]] settled today's Subotica in the 6th and 7th centuries, before some of them crossed the rivers Sava and Danube and settled in the [[Balkans]].

The Slavic tribe living in the territory of present-day Subotica were the [[Obotrites]], a subgroup of the [[Serbs]]. In the 9th century, after the fall of the Avar state, the first forms of Slavic statehood emerged in this area. The first Slavic states that ruled over this region included the [[Pannonian Slavs#Principality|Principality of Lower Pannonia]] (846-875), [[Great Moravia]] (833–{{circa}} 907) and the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]].{{sfn|Barford|2001}}

===Late Middle Ages===
[[File:Wiki.Vojvodina VII Subotica 4896 01.jpg|[[Emperor Jovan Nenad]] monument in the downtown|thumb|left]]
Subotica probably first became a settlement of note when people poured into it from nearby villages destroyed during the [[Tatar invasions]] of 1241–42. When ''Zabadka''/''Zabatka'' was first recorded in 1391, it was a tiny town in the medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Later, the city belonged to the [[Hunyadi family|Hunyadis]], one of the most influential aristocratic families in the whole of [[Central Europe]].

King [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary]] gave the town to one of his relatives, [[János Pongrác Dengelegi]], who, fearing an invasion by the [[Ottoman Empire]], fortified the castle of Subotica, erecting a fortress in 1470. Some decades later, after the [[Battle of Mohács]] in 1526, Subotica became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The majority of the Hungarian population fled northward to [[Royal Hungary]].<ref>[http://suboticadiversity.weebly.com/regional-history.html Subotica after the Battle of Mohács] Retrieved 8 September 2022.</ref> [[Bálint Török]], a local noble who had ruled over Subotica, also escaped from the city. During the military and political havoc following the defeat at [[Mohács]], Subotica came under the control of Serbian [[mercenaries]] recruited in [[Banat]]. These soldiers were in the service of the [[Transylvania]]n general [[John Zápolya|John I Zápolya]], a later Hungarian king.<ref>Balint Török, in: Géza Gárdonyi, Eger Stars, 2019, {{ISBN|978-1794777330}}.</ref>

The leader of these mercenaries, [[Jovan Nenad]], established in 1526–27 his rule in [[Bačka]], northern [[Banat]] and a small part of [[Syrmia]] and created an independent entity, with Subotica as its administrative centre. At the peak of his power, Jovan Nenad proclaimed himself as Serbian [[tsar]] in Subotica. He named [[Radoslav Čelnik]] as the general commander of his army, while his treasurer and [[palatine]] was Subota Vrlić, a Serbian noble from [[Jagodina]]. When Bálint Török returned and recaptured Subotica from the Serbs, Jovan Nenad moved the administrative centre to [[Szeged]].<ref>Borovszky Samu: Magyarország vármegyéi és városai, Bács-Bodrog vármegye I-II. kötet, Apolló Irodalmi és Nyomdai Részvénytársaság, 1909.</ref>

Some months later, in the summer of 1527, Jovan Nenad was [[assassinated]] and his entity collapsed. However, after Jovan Nenad's death, Radoslav Čelnik led a part of the army to Ottoman [[Syrmia]], where he briefly ruled as an Ottoman vassal.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Ottoman Empire===
The [[Ottoman Empire]] ruled the city from 1542 to 1686. At the end of this almost 150-year-long period, not much remained of the old town of ''Zabadka''/''Zabatka''. As much of the population had fled, the Ottomans encouraged the settlement of the area by different colonists from the [[Balkans]]. The settlers were mostly [[Serbian Orthodox|Orthodox]] [[Serbs]]. They cultivated the extremely fertile land around Subotica. In 1570, the population of Subotica numbered 49 houses, and in 1590, 63 houses. In 1687, the region was settled by [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] ''[[Dalmatia|Dalmatas]]'' (called [[Bunjevci]] today). It was called ''Sobotka'' under Ottoman rule and was a kaza centre in [[Sanjak of Segedin|Segedin]] sanjak at first in [[Budin Province, Ottoman Empire|Budin Eyaleti]] until 1596, and after that in [[Egir Province, Ottoman Empire|Eğri Eyaleti]] between 1596 and 1686.<ref>[[Sanjak of Segedin]]</ref>

===Habsburg Monarchy===
[[File:Razglednica Subotice.jpg|thumb|Subotica in Serbian early 20th-century postcard]]
In 1687, about 5,000 [[Bunjevci]] settled in Bačka (including Subotica). After the decisive battle against the Ottomans at [[Senta]] led by [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] on 11 September 1697, Subotica became part of the [[Military Frontier|military border]] zone [[Potisje|Theiss]]-[[Pomorišje|Mieresch]] established by the [[Habsburg monarchy]]. In the meantime the uprising of [[Francis II Rákóczi]] broke out, which is also known as the [[Kuruc War]].

In the region of Subotica, Rákóczi joined battle against the ''Rac National Militia''. ''[[Rác (ethnonym)|Rác]]'' was a designation for the South Slavic people (mostly Serbs and Bunjevci) and they often were referred to as ''rácok'' in the Kingdom of Hungary. In a later period ''rácok'' came to mean, above all, Serbs of Orthodox religion.{{sfn|Varga|2013|p=264}}

The Serbian military families enjoyed several privileges thanks to their service for the Habsburg Monarchy. Subotica gradually, however, developed from being a mere garrison town to becoming a market town with its own civil charter in 1743. When this happened, many Serbs complained about the loss of their privileges. The majority left the town in protest and some of them founded a new settlement just outside 18th century Subotica in [[Aleksandrovo, Subotica|Aleksandrovo]], while others emigrated to [[Russia]]. In [[New Serbia (historical province)|New Serbia]], a new Russian province established for them, those Serbs founded a new settlement and also named it ''Subotica''. In 1775, a Jewish community in Subotica was established.

It was perhaps to emphasise the new civic serenity of Subotica that the pious name ''[[Saint Mary]]'' came to be used for it at this time. Some decades later, in 1779, Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] advanced the town's status further by proclaiming it a Free Royal Town. The enthusiastic inhabitants of the city renamed Subotica once more as ''Maria-Theresiopolis''.<ref>[https://www.heritage-su.org.rs/en/town-house-2/ History of Subotica] Retrieved 8 September 2022.</ref>

This Free Royal Town status gave a great impetus to the development of the city. During the 19th century, its population doubled twice, attracting many people from all over the [[Habsburg monarchy]]. This led eventually to a considerable demographic change. In the first half of the 19th century, the Bunjevci had still been in the majority, but there was an increasing number of Hungarians and Jews settling in Subotica. This process was not stopped even by the outbreak of the [[Revolutions of 1848|Revolutions in the Habsburg monarchy (1848–49)]].

===1848-1849 Revolution===
[[File:Szabadka_1.jpg|thumb|left|Subotica in 1914 Hungarian postcard]]
During the 1848-49 Revolution, the proclaimed borders of autonomous [[Serbian Vojvodina]] included Subotica, but Serb troops could not establish control in the region. On 5 March 1849, at the locality named Kaponja (between Tavankut and Bajmok), there was a battle between the Serb and Hungarian armies, which was won by the Hungarians.

The first newspaper in the town was also published during the 1848/49 revolution—it was called ''Honunk állapota'' ("State of Our Homeland") and was published in Hungarian by Károly Bitterman's local printing company. Unlike most Serbs and Croats who confronted the Hungarians, part of the local Bunjevci people supported the Hungarian revolution.

In 1849, after the [[Hungarian revolution of 1848]] was defeated by the Russian and Habsburg armies, the town was separated from the Kingdom of Hungary together with most of the Bačka region, and became part of a separate Habsburg province, called [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]]. The administrative centre of this new province was [[Timișoara]]. The province existed until 1860. During the existence of the voivodeship, in 1853, Subotica acquired its impressive theatre.<ref>Vladan Gavrilović, The Serbian Vojvodina and Montenegro 1848-1849, University of Novi Sad, Faculty of Philosophy, 2021.</ref>

===Austria-Hungary===
After the establishment of the [[Ausgleich|Dual-Monarchy]] in 1867, there followed what is often called the "golden age" of city development of Subotica. Many schools were opened after 1867 and in 1869 the railway connected the city to the world. In 1896 an electrical power plant was built, further enhancing the development of the city and the whole region. Subotica now adorned itself with its remarkable Central European, [[fin de siècle]] architecture. In 1902 a Jewish synagogue was built in the Art Nouveau style.

Between 1849 and 1860 it was part of the [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?ID=58589|title=Subotica {{!}} Hrvatska enciklopedija|website=www.enciklopedija.hr|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref>

===Yugoslavia and Serbia===
[[File:Leševi na Senćanskom putu.jpg|thumb|left|Massacred bodies of [[Serbia]]n and [[Jews|Jewish]] civilians killed by Hungarian troops during the World War II]]
[[File:Serbia, Subotica, Monument to the Victims of Fascism, 20120921.jpg|thumb|Monument to the Victims of Fascism]]
Subotica had been part of [[Austria-Hungary]] until the end of [[World War I]]. In 1918, the city became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. As a result, Subotica became a border-town in [[Yugoslavia]] and did not, for a time, experience again the same dynamic prosperity it had enjoyed prior to World War I. However, during that time, Subotica was the third-largest city in Yugoslavia by population, following [[Belgrade]] and [[Zagreb]].

In 1941, Yugoslavia was invaded and partitioned by the [[Axis Powers]], and its northern parts, including Subotica, were annexed by Hungary. The annexation was not considered legitimate by the international community and the city was de jure still part of Yugoslavia. The [[Yugoslav government in exile]] received formal recognition of legitimacy as the representative of the country. On 11 April 1941, the Hungarian troops arrived in Subotica on the grounds that the majority of the people living in the city were ethnic Hungarians, which had been part of the Kingdom of Hungary for over 600 years. During [[World War II]], the city lost approximately 7,000 of its citizens, mostly Serbs, Hungarians and Jews. Before the war about 6,000 [[Jews]] had lived in Subotica; many of these were deported from the city during the [[Holocaust]], mostly to [[Auschwitz]]. In April 1944, under German administration, a ghetto was set up.<ref>[http://holocaust.rs/en/subotica/ Subotica in WWII] Retrieved 8 September 2022.</ref> In addition, many [[communists]] were executed during Axis rule. In 1944, the Axis forces left the city, and Subotica became part of the new [[Yugoslavia]]. During the 1944–45 period, about 8,000 citizens {{Failed verification|date=September 2020}} (mainly Hungarians) were killed by [[Yugoslav partisans|Partisans]] while re-taking the city as a retribution for supporting Axis Hungary.<ref>Mészáros Sándor: Holttá nyilvánítva - Délvidéki magyar fátum 1944–45, I-II, Hatodik Síp Alapítvány, Budapest 1995.</ref><ref>Cseres Tibor: Vérbosszú Bácskában, [[Magvető|Magvető kiadó]], Budapest 1991.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --></ref>{{Failed verification|date=September 2020}}

In the postwar period, Subotica has gradually been modernised. During the [[Yugoslav wars|Yugoslav]] and [[Kosovo war|Kosovo]] wars of the 1990s, a considerable number of Serb refugees came to the city from [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Kosovo]], while many ethnic Hungarians and Croats, as well as some local Serbs, left the region.

==Cityscape==
Subotica boasts a remarkable collection of buildings built in the [[Hungarian Secession]] style, a distinct variant of [[Art Nouveau#Secession in Austria–Hungary|Art Nouveau]].<ref>[https://sailingstonetravel.com/subotica-guide/ Buildings of Subotica]  Retrieved 8 September 2022.</ref> The Hungarian Secession style combined art nouveau vegetal ornaments and symbolic figures with traditional Hungarian motifs. It found its architectural expression in Subotica in the works of [[Marcell Komor]], [[Dezső Jakab]] and [[Ferenc Raichle]].{{cn|date=February 2024}} Iconic buildings like the [[Subotica Synagogue]] and the Reichel Palace, are recognized as some of the finest examples of this architectural style in Europe.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Synagogue in Subotica |url=https://artsandculture.google.com/story/the-synagogue-in-subotica/fQVxsfeZnKD4IA |access-date=2024-01-10 |website=Google Arts & Culture |language=en}}</ref>

The [[:sr:Градска кућа у Суботици|City Hall]] (built in 1908–1910) and the [[Subotica Synagogue|Synagogue]] (1902) are of especially outstanding beauty. These were built by the same architects, Marcell Komor and Dezső Jakab. Another exceptional example of art nouveau architecture is the actual [[:sr:Палата Рајхл у Суботици|Raichle Palace]], which was built in 1904 by Ferenc J. Raichle.

Church buildings include the [[Cathedral of St. Theresa of Avila]] dating from 1797, the Franciscan friary dating from 1723, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox churches]] also from the 18th century, and the [[Art Nouveau#Secession in Austria–Hungary|Hungarian Art Nouveau]] [[Subotica Synagogue]] from the early 20th century that reopened after a major renovation in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |last=jhe |date=2018-03-27 |title=Serbia: magnificent Subotica synagogue officially reopened |url=https://jewish-heritage-europe.eu/2018/03/27/serbia-magnificent-subotica-synagogue-officially-reopened/ |access-date=2024-07-05 |website=Jewish Heritage Europe |language=en-US}}</ref>

The historic [[National Theatre in Subotica]], which was built in 1854 as the first monumental public building in Subotica, was demolished in 2007, although it was declared a historic monument under state protection in 1983, and in 1991 it was added to the National Register as a monument of an extraordinary cultural value. It is currently in the midst of renovation and is scheduled to open in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gradjevinarstvo.rs/vesti/13012/810/radovi-na-rekonstrukciji-narodnog-pozorista-u-subotici|title=Radovi na rekonstrukciji Narodnog pozorišta u Subotici|website=Gradjevinarstvo|date=16 March 2016 }}</ref>

Subotica has the highest concentration of Catholics in Serbia with almost half of the city's population being Catholic. It is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Subotica|Roman Catholic diocese]] with jurisdiction over the [[Bačka]] region. There are eight Catholic parish churches, a [[Franciscan]] spiritual centre (the city has communities of both Franciscan friars and Franciscan nuns), a female [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] community, and two congregations of [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] religious sisters. The diocese of Subotica has the only Catholic secondary school in Serbia (Paulinum).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Among other Christian communities, the members of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] are the most numerous with almost third of city's population. There are two [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]] church buildings in the city. Orthodox Christians in Subotica belong to the [[Eparchy of Bačka]] of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]]. Subotica has two [[Protestant]] churches as well, [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and [[Calvinism|Calvinist]].

===Universities===
*Teacher Training Faculty in the Hungarian Language of the [[University of Novi Sad]]

Tutoring of teachers in Subotica dates back to the late 18th century. After the establishment of Austria-Hungary, the second state-financed teacher training faculty of Hungary was founded in Subotica, second to Buda only. Modern history of teacher training in Subotica started in 2006, when the Sombor Teacher Training Faculty's curriculums in the Hungarian language seceded from the faculty and became independent as the 14th faculty of the University of Novi Sad.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://magister.uns.ac.rs/A-kar-tortenete/tartalom/9/ | title=A Kar története MTTK }}</ref> As of 2022, the faculty offers bachelor's degrees in kindergarten teaching, elementary school teaching, disciplinatory teaching and communications, and master's degrees in kindergarten teaching and elementary school teaching.

===Historical schools (1920 to 1941)===
*[[Subotica Law School]]

==Sport==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
Subotica has one major [[association football|football]] stadium, the [[Subotica City Stadium]], indoor arena and indoor swimming pool. The local football team is [[FK Spartak Zlatibor Voda|Spartak]] and plays in the [[Serbian SuperLiga]], the country's primary football competition.

==Media==
Newspapers and magazines published in Subotica:
* ''[[Magyar Szó]]'', daily newspaper in Hungarian, founded 1944, published in Subotica since 2006
* ''[[Subotičke novine]]'', main weekly newspaper in Serbian
* ''[[Hrvatska riječ]]'', in Croatian
* ''[[Zvonik]]'', in Croatian
* ''[[Bunjevačke novine]]'', in Bunjevac

==Infrastructure==
[[File:Subotica_train_station_(2024).jpg|thumb|Subotica Central Railway Station]]
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
[[A1 motorway (Serbia)|A1 motorway]] connects the city with [[Novi Sad]] and [[Belgrade]] to the south and, across the border with Hungary, with [[Szeged]] to the north. It runs alongside the [[Budapest–Belgrade railway]], which connects it to major European cities. As of November 2022, the line is out of order without replacement as both the Serbian and the Hungarian part of the line is currently being reconstructed. Subotica also has branch line railway connections to [[Sombor]], [[Senta]] (with passenger service), and [[Szeged]] through [[Horgoš]] (under reconstruction with limited freight service, passenger service planned to commence in late 2023), while the former branch line to [[Baja, Hungary|Baja]] through [[Csikéria]] was dismantled in the 1960s but parts of the derelict tracks are still visible in the city's northwestern outskirts.

The city used to have a tram system, the [[Subotica tram system]], but it was discontinued in 1974. The Subotica tram, put into operation in 1897, ran on electricity from the start. While neighbouring cities' trams at this date were often still horse-drawn, this gave the Subotica system an advantage over other municipalities including Belgrade, Novi Sad, Zagreb, and Szeged. Its existence was important for the citizens of Subotica, as well as tourists who came to visit.
Subotica has since developed a bus system, operated by JP Subotica Trans, who operates eleven city lines, eight suburban lines, and thirteen interurban lines, as well as a single international line to Szeged. Per year the buses travel some 4.7 million kilometres, and carry about ten million people.

The city is served by [[Subotica Airport]]; its runway is too short for airliners, limiting usage to mostly recreational aviation. Southwest of the city there is a 218.5 metres tall guyed mast for FM-/TV-broadcasting. It is the tallest of its kind in Serbia and one of the tallest in the region.
