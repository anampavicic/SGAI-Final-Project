'''Đồng Nai''' is a [[Provinces of Vietnam|province]] in the [[Southeast (Vietnam)|Southeast]] region of [[Vietnam]], located east and northeast of [[Ho Chi Minh City]] (Saigon). The capital city and the largest city in Đồng Nai is [[Biên Hòa]].

==Geography==
Đồng Nai is in southeastern Vietnam and bordered by: [[Bình Thuận Province|Bình Thuận]], [[Lâm Đồng Province|Lâm Đồng]], [[Bình Dương Province|Bình Dương]] and [[Bình Phước Province|Bình Phước]], [[Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu province|Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu]], and [[Ho Chi Minh City]] (Saigon). Đồng Nai has an advanced traffic system with many backbone national roads crossing it, such as: National Route 1A, National Route 20, National Route 51 and the North–South railway lines; located adjacent to the Saigon Port and Tan Son Nhat International Airport, it offers many advantages to economic activities in the area. Its location is very important for the development of the Southern economic main hub and a junction of the South Eastern and Tây Nguyên Highland.

Đồng Nai is based essentially on the system of lakes, dams and rivers, of which [[Trị An Lake]] with an area of 323&nbsp;km² and over 60 rivers, rivulets and canals are very favorable for the development of a number of aquatic products: raft bred fish and shrimp. The [[seasonal tropical forest]]s are protected in [[Cát Tiên National Park]], located in the north of Đồng Nai and the adjacent [[Vĩnh Cửu District|Vĩnh Cửu Nature Reserve]]; the former has been recognized internationally as a significant [[Man and the Biosphere Programme|biosphere reserve]]. From the mountainous area, [[Đồng Nai River]], Vietnam's largest internal waterway, flows southeast through Biên Hòa City, Ho Chi Minh City, and villages along its way. This river plays a crucial role in providing fresh water for the entire region.

===Climate===
Đồng Nai lies in the monsoon tropical zone and is affected by the north-east and south-west monsoon. It is also under the influence of the Pacific Ocean tropical atmosphere between April and October. The climate is divided into two distinct seasons: the rainy season lasts from March or April to November and the dry season from December to March or April of the following year. The average temperature is between 23.9 and 29.0&nbsp;°C, much lower than the standard level of tropical regions (26-30&nbsp;°C). Its annual rainfall is quite high with 1,500 - 2,700&nbsp;mm.

On average, the weather is sunny for 4.0-9.5 hours a day and does not exceed 11.5 hours per day, even on the hottest and sunniest days. Total rainy days within a year are between 120 and 170 days (the standard level of tropical regions is 150–160 days) with a total rainfall of some 1,500 - 2,750&nbsp;mm. The average humidity is around 80 - 82% and humidity in the dry season is 10-12%, lower than that of the rainy season; humidity varies considerably between areas.

Đồng Nai's weather with regular sunshine, rain, and high humidity, equally found in the localities, facilitates agricultural production and development of industrial, cultural and tourist activities.

===Resources===
Đồng Nai is plentiful with resources such as forests, [[granite]] mines, construction stone, clay, [[kaolin]], [[pozzolan]], sand and gravel.

==Demographics==
Đồng Nai is one of Vietnam's most populous provinces (ranked fifth) with a population of 2,838,600 in 2014.<ref name="Statistic office"/> Its population has been growing rapidly in recent years, mainly driven by migrant workers coming to the province to work in factories. Population growth was 1.95% in 2005, between 2.5% from 2008 to 2010 and 3.5% in 2011. Net migration contributed 2.2% to this figure.<ref name="GSO11">General Statistics Office (2012): Statistical Yearbook of Vietnam 2011. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi</ref> Đồng Nai is second only to [[Bình Dương province]] in both population growth and net migration.

The population of Đồng Nai is primarily the dominant [[Kinh]] (Viet) ethnicity, although there are residents of the [[Hoa people|Chinese]], [[Stieng people|Stieng]], [[Mạ people|Mạ]], [[Nùng people|Nùng]], [[Tay people|Tay]], and [[Cham people|Cham]] minorities.

==Transportation==
Đồng Nai has made significant progress in upgrading its transport infrastructure, especially roads. National highways in the province have a total length of 244.5&nbsp;km and have been improved and widened up to level 1 and 2 standards (National Highway No. 5 and 6) or up to third grade like National Highway No. 20 to [[Da Lat|Đà Lạt]]. The total roads system in the province is 3,339 kilometers long, of which almost 700 kilometers are tar roads. All communes and wards are connected to the road network.

Under scheme in the near future, highways to [[Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu province]]<ref>{{Cite news | title = Work on Bien Hoa-Vung Tau expressway to start next April| url = https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/work-on-bien-hoa-vung-tau-expressway-to-start-next-april-4496578.html | publisher= Vnexpress  }}</ref> and [[Ho Chi Minh City]], a railway connecting Biên Hòa to [[Vũng Tàu]], upgrading provincial road No. 726 and connecting National Highway No. 20 and No. 1 with National Highway No. 51 will create a complete system, promoting socioeconomic development in the province and region.

A new airport, [[Long Thành International Airport]], is planned for construction in Long Thành district, Đồng Nai, approximately 40&nbsp;km northeast of [[Ho Chi Minh City]].<ref>{{Cite news | title = Long Thanh airport set to serve first flight in September 2025| url = https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/long-thanh-airport-set-to-serve-first-flight-in-september-2025-4510361.html | publisher= Vnexpress  }}</ref> Upon completion, it will handle international flights in place of [[Tan Son Nhat International Airport]], which will serve domestic flights.

==Administrative divisions==
