It serves as the core of the [[Taichung–Changhua metropolitan area]], Taiwan's second-largest metropolitan area.

Located in the [[Taichung Basin]], the city was initially developed from several scattered hamlets helmed by the [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples]]. It was constructed to be the new capital of [[Taiwan Province]] and renamed "[[Taiwanfu (disambiguation)|Taiwan-fu]]" in the late [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Qing dynastic era]] between 1887 and 1894. During the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese era]] from 1895, the urban planning of present-day Taichung was performed and developed by the Japanese.<ref>Taichung History Map Walk, publish by Center for Digital Cultures，Academia Sinica，2017，p.23.  {{ISBN|9789860546279}}</ref> The urban area of Taichung was organized as a [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|provincial city]] from the start of ROC rule in 1945 until 25 December 2010, when the original provincial city and [[Taichung County]] were merged into a new special municipality.<ref>http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xitem=53774&ctnode=413&mp=9{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref>

The city is home to the [[National Museum of Natural Science]], the [[National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts]], the [[National Taichung Theater]], the [[National Library of Public Information]], [[National Taiwan Museum of Comics]], [[National Taiwan Symphony Orchestra]], as well as many cultural sites, including the historic [[Taichung Park]], the [[Wufeng Lin Family Mansion and Garden|Lin Family Gardens]], and many [[Temples of Taichung|temples]].

==History==
===Early history===
The [[Atayal people|Atayal aborigines]] as well as several [[Taiwanese Plains Aborigines|Taiwanese Plains Aboriginal tribes]] (including the [[Taokas people|Taokas]], [[Papora people|Papora]], [[Pazeh people|Pazeh]], [[Hoanya people|Hoanya]] and [[Babuza people|Babuzas]]) populated the plains that make up modern Taichung. They were originally [[Hunter-gatherer|hunter gatherers]] who later lived by cultivating [[millet]] and [[taro]].<ref name="city_history_website">{{cite web |url=http://eng.taichung.gov.tw/ct.aspx?xItem=6046&ctNode=843&mp=1 |title=From Aboriginal Homeland to Modern City: A Look at Taichung's Rich History |access-date=2014-11-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204174755/http://eng.taichung.gov.tw/ct.aspx?xItem=6046&ctNode=843&mp=1 |archive-date=2014-12-04 | url-status=dead}}</ref> In the 17th century, the [[Papora people|Papora]], [[Babuza people|Babuza]], [[Pazeh people|Pazeh]], and [[Hoanya people|Hoanya]] established the [[Kingdom of Middag]], occupying the western part of present-day Taichung.{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}}
[[File:Ji-Shan Gatehouse.JPG|thumb|right| [[Jishan Gatehouse]], built in 1924]]

===Qing dynasty===
In 1684, [[Zhuluo County]] was established, encompassing the underdeveloped northern two-thirds of Taiwan. Modern-day Taichung traces its beginnings to a settlement named ''Toatun'' ({{zh|t=大墩|p=Dàdūn|w=Ta<sup>4</sup>-tun<sup>1</sup>|poj=Toā-tun|l=large mound}}) in 1705. To strengthen Qing control, a garrison was established in 1721 near the site of present-day [[Taichung Park]] by Lan Ting-chen.{{sfnp|Roy|2003|p=27}}

North of the city, on the [[Tachia River|Dajia River]], an aboriginal revolt broke out in 1731 after Chinese officials moved in and compelled them to provide labor. The revolt spread through the city as far south as [[Changhua County#Qing dynasty|Changhua County]] in May 1732 before the rebels were chased into the mountains by Qing forces.{{sfnp|Roy|2003|p=22}} In 1786, another rebellion against the Qing, known as the [[Lin Shuangwen rebellion]], began as an attempt to overthrow the government and restore the [[Ming dynasty]]. Unfortunately, as the rebels moved northward, they turned to slaughter and looting. They were eventually defeated by a coalition of Qing forces, [[Hakka people|Hakka]], [[Quanzhou]] [[Fujian]]ese descendants, and aboriginal volunteers.{{sfnp|Gardella|1999|p=164}}

When [[Taiwan Province#Qing dynasty|Taiwan Province]] was declared an independent province in 1887, the government intended to construct its capital city at the centrally located ''Toatun'', which was also designated as the seat of [[Taiwan Prefecture]].{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=245|ps=: "...the seat of government (which had been formerly at the old town of Taiwan-fu in the south, which city had been in turn the capital of the Dutch, Koxinga, and the Chinese,) was now removed temporarily to the new city of [[Taipei|Taipeh]], which had been lately in course of construction&nbsp;... In connection with this, it is necessary to go further and explain that it was the intention of the government to build a new capital city in the center of the island near Changwha. Accordingly, the new city was laid out and the construction of official yamens commenced. The name of the new city became Taiwan-fu, or the capital city of Taiwan (Formosa), and it was also to be the seat of a new prefecture called [[Taiwan Prefecture|Taiwan [Prefecture]]]."}} Thus the city took the title of "Taiwan-fu", meaning "capital city of Taiwan", from modern-day [[Tainan]], which had held the title for more than 200 years. Qing official [[Liu Ming-chuan]] received permission to oversee development of the area, which included constructing a railway through the city.{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|pp=247-8|ps=:"To obtain Imperial sanction to the undertaking, Governor Liu represented to the authorities that, if the capital was removed into the interior as they had recommended, it would be necessary, as there were no roads, to construct a railway from the new capital to one of the coast ports, preferably Kelung in the north. This proposition met with sonic opposition in [[Beijing|Peking]], but eventually Imperial approbation was obtained." }} However, the provincial capital was ultimately moved to [[Taipei]].

===Empire of Japan===
After the Qing dynasty lost the [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] in 1895, Taiwan was ceded to Japan by the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]], and the name of the city was changed to {{nihongo||臺中|Taichū|lead=yes}}. The Japanese sought to develop the city to make it the first "modern" area of Taiwan{{sfnp|Roy|2003|p=36}} and invested in roads, dams, and levees. In 1901, {{nihongo4||臺中廳|Taichū Chō}} was established as one of twenty local administrative districts on the island. In 1904, the town of Taichū had a population of 6,423, and Taichū District had more than 207,000.{{sfnp|Takekoshi|1907|pp=199-200}}

[[Taichung Park|Taichū Park]] was completed in 1903. A tower marking the old north gate was moved to the new park where it stands today. The first market in Taichū was built in 1908, along Jiguang Road between the Zhongzheng and Chenggong Roads and it is still in use today.<ref name="city_history_website" /> The Japanese undertook a north–south island railway project. [[Taichung Railway Station (TRA)|Taichū Train Station]] was completed and began operation in 1917,<ref name="city_history_website" /> and still operates today. Taichū City was officially declared by Japanese authorities in 1920, and [[Taichū City Hall]] was completed in 1924 after eleven years of construction.<ref name="city_history_website" /> {{nihongo4|Kōkan Airport|公館空港}}, now known as [[Taichung Airport]], was constructed during Japanese rule.
[[File:台中州廳（舊台中市政府）.jpg|thumb|right| [[Taichū City Hall|Taichung's historic city hall]]]]

Taichū Middle School (now known as [[Taichung First Senior High School]]) was founded in 1915 by elite members of local gentry, including [[Lin Hsien-tang]] and his brother {{ill|Lin Lieh-tang|zh|林烈堂}}, two wealthy Taiwanese intellectuals of the era. This was in an effort to teach children the [[culture of Taiwan]] and to foster the spirit of the [[Taiwanese localization movement]].<ref name="city_history_website" /> The [[Taiwanese Cultural Association]], founded in 1921 in Taipei by Lin Hsien-tang, was moved to Taichū in 1927. Most of the members of this association were from Taichū and the surrounding area. The city became a center of Taiwanese culture and nationalism.<ref name="city_history_website" />

From 1926 to 1945, [[Taichū Prefecture]] covered modern-day Taichung as well as [[Changhua County]] and [[Nantou County]].

===Republic of China===
After the [[Retrocession Day|handover of Taiwan from Japan]] to the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in October 1945, [[Taichung County]] was established, which consists of present-day area of Taichung City, [[Miaoli County]] and [[Taoyuan, Taiwan|Taoyuan City]]. In 1947 the first mayor of Taichung County (which included Taichung City) was Lai Tien Shen. The position was appointed by the government to rule during the interim period. Taichung also served as the temporary capital of the exiled [[Jiangxi]] (Kiangsi) provincial government in 1949 after the [[Chinese Communist Party]] took control of the province.<ref>https://www.culture.taichung.gov.tw/media/827206/文化萬象p53-57.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=August 2024}}</ref> In 1950, Miaoli and Taoyuan were taken out from Taichung County area to form [[Miaoli County]] and [[Taoyuan, Taiwan|Taoyuan County]] respectively. In June 2009, the [[Executive Yuan]] approved the plan to merge Taichung City and Taichung County to form a larger Taichung City.<ref>{{cite news |date=1 February 2011 |url=https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&post=6187 |title=Rezoning Taiwan |publisher=Taiwan Today |access-date=9 December 2020 |archive-date=12 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210112165942/https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&post=6187 |url-status=live }}</ref> On 25 December 2010, the city was merged with the surrounding [[Taichung County]] to create a [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipality]] of 2.65 million people spread across {{cvt|2,214|km2}}.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.intelligentcommunity.org/index.php?src=news&refno=714&prid=714 |title=Intelligent Community Forum (ICF) |access-date=2013-01-11 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130415020055/http://www.intelligentcommunity.org/index.php?src=news&refno=714&prid=714 |archive-date=2013-04-15 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2020, Taichung was classified as a "Gamma" level global city by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The World According to GaWC 2020 |url=https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2020t.html |website=GaWC - Research Network |publisher=Globalization and World Cities |access-date=31 August 2020 |archive-date=24 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200824031341/https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2020t.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Due to the protection provided by the Central Mountain Range to the east and the Miaoli hills to the north, Taichung is rarely severely affected by [[typhoon]]s, but typhoons emerging from the [[South China Sea]] occasionally pose a threat to the city, as evidenced by [[Typhoon Wayne (1986)|Typhoon Wayne]] in 1986, which struck Taiwan's west coast near Taichung.<ref name="typhwayne">{{cite web |url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/atcr/1986atcr/pdf/wnp/12w.pdf |title=Typhoon Wayne (12W) |author=Joint Typhoon Warning Center |access-date=2007-05-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506073147/http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/atcr/1986atcr/pdf/wnp/12w.pdf |archive-date=2011-05-06 |url-status=dead}}</ref>{{Weather box|width=auto

===Local politics===
Unlike [[Taipei]] in the north, which is solidly in the [[Pan-Blue]] political camp, and the southern cities of [[Kaohsiung]] and [[Tainan City|Tainan]] that are solidly [[Pan-Green]], Taichung is more balanced, with the urban city center area leaning Blue and the suburban and rural areas leaning Green. In fact, both major political parties have won a mayoral election among the last four with at least 49 percent of the vote ([[Democratic Progressive Party]] in 1997 and 2014 and the [[Kuomintang]] in 2001 and 2005).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://vote2014.nat.gov.tw/en/TC/n400000000000000.html |title=2014 Local Elections |access-date=2015-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224145743/http://vote2014.nat.gov.tw/en/TC/n400000000000000.html |archive-date=2014-12-24 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Similarly, the Kuomintang majority in the [[Taichung City Council|city council]] is not as large as it is in other cities, and is only negligible when one excludes [[Beitun District]], which is solidly pro-Kuomintang. The incumbent Mayor of Taichung is [[Lu Shiow-yen]] of the [[Kuomintang]].

[[File:Taiwan HighSpeedRail TaiChung Station 5.JPG|thumb|THSR Taichung Station]]
Two railways run parallel to each other in Taichung: the [[Taichung Line]], which passes through the urban areas in the interior, and the [[West Coast line (Taiwan)|West Coast Line]], which passes through rural areas closer to the coastal shore. [[Taichung TRA station|Taichung railway station]] is located in the heart of the city in [[Central District, Taichung|Central District]] and numerous bus companies provide connections to other towns by bus.

The [[Taichung High Speed Rail Station|THSR Taichung Station]] is located in [[Wuri, Taichung|Wuri district]], serving travel demands of both Taichung City and the northern parts of Changhua County.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.thsrc.com.tw/ArticleContent/4b80429e-2b1a-429d-93ab-6870d49cab03|title=THSR Taichung Station Info|website=Taiwan High Speed Rail|access-date=17 March 2024}}</ref> THSR Taichung Station is accessible by [[Taiwan Railways Administration|local trains]] and [[Green Line (Taichung Metro)|MRT Green Line]] through [[Xinwuri railway station]] as well as free shuttle buses into the city.

===Seaport===
[[Port of Taichung|Taichung Port]], located on the coast in Taichung City, is the second largest cargo facility on the island capable of handling container shipping.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shan|first=Shelley|url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2010/12/23/2003491632|title=Taichung's port passes Keelung in cargo, MOTC says|website=Taipei Times|date=23 December 2010|access-date=17 March 2024}}</ref> Despite being the second largest port on the island of Taiwan, there are no passenger ferry services available and the port is closed to unauthorized personnel.

===Roads===
Taichung City generally follows a radial road layout, with its center at [[Taichung railway station]]. Major roads start in Central District and run outwards, including Taiwan Boulevard, Xiangshang Road, Zhongqing Road, and Zhongshan Road.

[[National freeway 1|Freeway 1]] runs along the Fazi River on the outskirts of the city, while [[National freeway 3|Freeway 3]] runs along the [[Dadu River (Taiwan)|Dadu River]] to the coastal plains on the west, where it then runs parallel to the coastline. [[Freeway 4 (Taiwan)|Freeway 4]] begins in [[Qingshui District]] and terminates in [[Fengyuan District]]. [[Provincial Highway 74 (Taiwan)|Highway 74]], known as the Taichung Ring Expressway circles the outskirts of the city, while [[Provincial Highway 63 (Taiwan)|Highway 63]], known as the Zhongtou Expressway, runs from Taichung southward to [[Caotun]], [[Nantou County|Nantou]]. Many other highways run through the city.

Most road signs in the city have [[Romanization of Chinese|romanized spelling]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://english.taichung.gov.tw/797674/post|title=Romanization of Taichung's top 50 Main Roads|website=Taichung City Government|access-date=17 March 2024}}</ref>

The most frequently used public transportation system in Taichung is by bus, with 18 bus companies providing 275 routes that cover all districts. All station names are announced in both Mandarin and English, while some also provide Hokkien pronunciations. For local passengers using a [[Contactless smart card|contactless smartcard]] (for example, an [[EasyCard]]), the first 10 kilometers are free.<ref>{{cite news |author=張順祥 |title=台中雙十公車25日上路 10公里免費最多收10元 |url = https://www.rti.org.tw/news/view/id/2048129 |access-date=2020-08-25 |publisher =Rti 中央廣播電臺 |date=2020-01-14 |archive-date=2020-09-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200911060839/https://www.rti.org.tw/news/view/id/2048129 |url-status=live }}</ref> In addition, some taxi served as bus routes in rural areas.<ref>{{Cite web |author=趙容萱 |title=中市小黃公車新增3條路今上路 首次串連捷運 |url=https://udn.com/news/story/7266/7718026 |date=2024-01-18 |access-date=2024-05-02 |website=聯合新聞網 |language=zh-Hant-TW}}</ref>

===Mass Rapid Transit===
{{See also|Taichung Metropolitan Area MRT System}}
[[File:Sihwei Elementary School Station Platform 2020-11-17.jpg|thumb|Taichung MRT green line at Sihwei Elementary School Station]]
The city currently has one [[rapid transit|MRT]] line, the [[Green line (Taichung Metro)|Green line]], which opened on April 25, 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.railwaygazette.com/metros/taichung-mrt-green-line-opens/59007.article|title=Taichung MRT Green Line opens|website=Metro Report International|date=27 April 2021|access-date=17 March 2024}}</ref> A second line, the [[Blue line (Taichung Metro)|Blue line]], was approved in 2024 and is expected to open in 2034.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.railwaygazette.com/metros/taichung-metro-blue-line-approved/65855.article|title=Taichung metro Blue Line approved|website=Metro Report International|date=8 February 2024|access-date=17 March 2024}}</ref>

For a short period of time, the city operated a [[bus rapid transit]] system, named the [[Taichung BRT Blue Line|BRT Blue Line]], running down Taiwan Boulevard. It used [[articulated bus]]es running a specialized lane, a first in Taiwan. The system began operation in July 2014;<ref>{{cite web|last=Ya-ching|first=Chang|url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/08/11/2003597160|title=Taichung's BRT fails to impress: poll|website=Taipei Times|date=11 August 2014|access-date=17 March 2024}}</ref> however, it did little to ameliorate traffic congestion, and was terminated within a year. The lane and specialized bus stops are currently used as a general bus lane, with bus lines 300-310 running through it.

===Taichung International Airport===

Currently, there are 17 universities, 50 high schools, 71 junior high schools, and 235 elementary schools in Taichung. In addition, there are four special schools, [[List of international schools in Taiwan|three international schools]], and nine community colleges in the city.<ref>{{cite web | title = 教育部教育統計查詢網 | url = http://stats.moe.gov.tw/qframe.aspx?qno=MQA3AA2 | access-date = 2013-09-29 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131002101716/http://stats.moe.gov.tw/qframe.aspx?qno=MQA3AA2 | archive-date = 2013-10-02  |language=zh-tw}}</ref>

==Romanization==
Taichung City is in the process of implementing [[Hanyu Pinyin]] on road signs throughout the city. However, there are still signs displaying spellings from previously used romanization systems, as well as [[Tongyong Pinyin]] and systems that do not conform to any standard system.<ref name="pinyin">{{cite web |url=http://webeng.tccg.gov.tw/general.php?page=general_brief_01&id=15&pid=15 |title=Romanization of Taichung's top 50 Main Roads |access-date=2006-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206162332/http://webeng.tccg.gov.tw/general.php?page=general_brief_01&id=15&pid=15 |archive-date=2006-02-06 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Unlike [[Taipei]], which uses a capital letter at the beginning of every syllable, Taichung City uses the standard form of Hanyu Pinyin on street signs erected in recent years. However, the municipal website uses the Taipei system. Most major intersections have at least one sign containing some form of romanization. Nearly every intersection in the downtown area has signs in Hanyu Pinyin. However, outside of the downtown area, while coverage by Hanyu Pinyin signs is improving, many intersections have signs in other romanization systems (especially Wade–Giles and MPS2) or no Romanized signs at all.

==Culture and recreation==

===Museums and cultural centers===
[[File:NTMoFA-1.jpg|thumb|right| [[National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts]]]]

*The [[National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts]] houses the world's largest collection of Taiwanese art.
*[[National Museum of Natural Science]] together with [[National Palace Museum]] in Taipei and the [[National Science and Technology Museum]] in Kaohsiung are called "the Museums of Taiwan". Across {{cvt|22|acre|m2}}, the museum is a six-venue complex housing the Space IMAX Theater, Science Center, Life Science Hall, Chinese Science Hall, Global Environment Hall and the Botanical Garden, excluding the Earthquake Museum in Wufong, which is dedicated to public education on seismology, located just 10 kilometers east of the main complex of NMNS. Over 30 permanent exhibit areas cover subjects on astronomy, space science, paleontology, ecology, gems and minerals, Taiwanese Aborigines, and tropical plants. Rotating special exhibits are a constant occurrence.
*Taichung Municipal Cultural Center: The Municipal Cultural Center is located on Yingcai Road on property adjacent to the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts.
*[[Taichung Folklore Park]]: This park is dedicated to presenting a more traditional Taiwanese way of life. It includes a combination of authentic and recreated buildings and streets in an attempt to recreate a more rustic Taiwan.
*[[921 Earthquake Museum of Taiwan]]: This museum is located in [[Wufeng District]]. With the rebuilding of Kwangfu Junior High on its present site, the Earthquake Memorial Museum was renamed the 921 Earthquake Museum of Taiwan on February 13, 2001. The new plan retains the original sites as a record of the damage wrought by the earthquake, and it also adds technological and educational facilities designed to inform the public and school children about earthquakes and disaster readiness.
*[[Asia Museum of Modern Art]]: This museum is located at [[Asia University (Taiwan)|Asia University]] in Wufeng District. On May 4, 2007, Dr. Tsai presented the project plan and officially invited Mr. Tadao Ando to design an art museum for Asia University. Therefore, the main purpose of inviting Tadao Ando to design the museum was to educate students and create the opportunity for them to have contact with art works from masters of international status. This museum provides various and amazing exhibitions which are related to Asian art and modern art.

==Sports==
===Professional sports===
The [[Sinon Bulls]] was a professional baseball team playing in the four-team [[Chinese Professional Baseball League]]. While they were identified with Taichung City, many of their “home games” were played outside of the city due to the inadequacies of the old [[Taichung Baseball Field]]. The team was expected to move into the newly completed [[Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium]] in 2008, but never did. At the end of the 2012 season, Sinon Corporation announced its intention to sell the team. By late December, an agreement was reached between Sinon Corporation and E-United Group, and the team was renamed EDA Rhinos and moved to Kaohsiung. The ''[[Special Force II]]'' division of the [[Flash Wolves]] [[esports]] team is known as the Taichung Flash Wolves, the team competed in the Special Force II Pro League (SF2PL) based in Taipei.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aedu/201509250027.aspx |title=Taiwan to hold Special Force 2 Pro League video game tourney |website=FOCUS TAIWAN |date=March 25, 2015 |access-date=October 22, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151014110040/http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aedu/201509250027.aspx |archive-date=October 14, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> Taichung is home to Taichung City FC, a club which strives to represent Taichung in soccer tournaments as well as charitable events.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://tcfc29.com/about-us/ |title=About Us |access-date=2020-12-18 |archive-date=2021-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210227214904/https://tcfc29.com/about-us/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
