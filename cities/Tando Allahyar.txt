Tando Allahyar is a marginalised, lower-income area, with state involvement limited to constructing school buildings and providing teachers. Teachers receive little training and have tended to follow an old-fashioned, authoritarian model of teaching; [[Zahid Shahab Ahmed]] noted in 2017 that some teachers had expressed unfamiliarity with the concept of participatory classes where students were encouraged to develop independent critical-thinking ability. Education in Tando Allahyar is generally in [[Urdu]] due to its widespread familiarity among students.<ref name="Peace Education">{{cite book |last1=Ahmed |first1=Zahid Shahab |title=Peace Education in Pakistan |date=March 2017 |publisher=United States Institute of Peace |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep12405 |accessdate=6 August 2020}}</ref>
