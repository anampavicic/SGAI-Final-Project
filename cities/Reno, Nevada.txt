'''Reno''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|iː|n|oʊ}} {{respell|REE|noh}}) is a [[city]] in the northwest section of the [[U.S.]] state of [[Nevada]], along the Nevada–California border. It is the [[county seat]] and most populous city of [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]]. Sitting in the High Eastern Sierra foothills, in the [[Truckee River]] valley, on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada, it is about {{convert|23|mi|km}} northeast of [[Lake Tahoe]]. Known as "The Biggest Little City in the World",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reno.gov/ |title=City of Reno: Home |publisher=Reno.gov |access-date=2013-01-16 |archive-date=May 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511050635/http://www.reno.gov/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> it is the [[List of United States cities by population|80th most populous city]] in the [[United States]], the [[List of cities in Nevada|3rd most populous city in Nevada]], and the most populous in Nevada outside the [[Las Vegas Valley]]. The city had a population of 264,165 at the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]].<ref name="Pop2020">{{cite web|url=https://data.census.gov/cedsci/profile?g=1600000US3260600|title=Census - Geography Profile: Reno city, Nevada|access-date=April 21, 2022}}</ref>

The city is named after Civil War Union Major General [[Jesse L. Reno]], who was killed in action during the [[American Civil War]] at the [[Battle of South Mountain]], on Fox's Gap.

Reno is part of the [[Reno, NV Metropolitan Statistical Area|Reno–Sparks metropolitan area]], the second-most populous metropolitan area in Nevada after the [[Las Vegas Valley]].<ref name="CensusQuickFacts">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/renocitynevada/PST045218 |title=QuickFacts – Reno city, Nevada |website=United States Census Bureau |access-date=2019-07-01}}</ref> Known as Greater Reno, it includes Washoe, [[Storey County, Nevada|Storey]], [[Lyon County, Nevada|Lyon]] Counties, the independent city and state capital, [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]], as well as parts of [[Placer County, California|Placer]] and [[Nevada County, California|Nevada]] Counties in California.<ref name="Reno CSA">{{cite web |url=https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/PEP/2017/GCTPEPANNR.US24PR |title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2017 -United States – Metropolitan Statistical Area; and for Puerto Rico – 2017 Population Estimates |website=United States Census Bureau |access-date=2018-09-11 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213005215/https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/PEP/2017/GCTPEPANNR.US24PR |archive-date=February 13, 2020 }}</ref> The Reno metro area (along with the neighboring city [[Sparks, Nevada|Sparks]]) occupies a valley colloquially known as the [[Truckee Meadows]].

For much of the twentieth century Reno saw a significant number of migrants seeking to take advantage of Nevada's relatively lax divorce laws and the city gained a national reputation as a [[divorce mill]]. Today Reno is a tourist destination known for its [[casino gambling]] and proximity to Lake Tahoe and the [[Sierra Nevada Mountains]].

===Early history===
Archaeological finds place the eastern border for the prehistoric [[Martis people]] in the Reno area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sagehen.ucnrs.org/CSFRS/petros.htm |title=North Fork petroglyphs |access-date=August 15, 2008 |last=Brauman |first=Sharon K. |date=October 6, 2004 |publisher=ucnrs.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724171614/http://sagehen.ucnrs.org/CSFRS/petros.htm |archive-date=July 24, 2008 }}</ref> As early as the mid-1850s, a few pioneers settled in the [[Truckee Meadows]], a relatively fertile valley through which the [[Truckee River]] made its way from [[Lake Tahoe]] to [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]]. In addition to [[subsistence farming]], these early residents could pick up business from travelers along the [[California Trail]], which followed the Truckee westward, before branching off towards [[Donner Lake]], where the formidable obstacle of the Sierra Nevada began.

[[Gold]] was discovered in the vicinity of [[Virginia City, Nevada|Virginia City]] in 1850, and a modest mining community developed, but the discovery of [[silver]] in 1859 at the [[Comstock Lode]] led to a [[silver rush|mining rush]], and thousands of emigrants left their homes, bound for the West, hoping to find a fortune.

To provide the necessary connection between Virginia City and the California Trail, Charles W. Fuller built a log toll bridge across the Truckee River in 1859. A small community that served travelers soon grew near the bridge.{{r|VCS 2023/01/11}} After two years, Fuller sold the bridge to Myron C. Lake, who continued to develop the community by adding a grist mill, kiln, and livery stable to the hotel and eating house. He renamed it "Lake's Crossing". Most of what is present-day western Nevada was formed as the [[Nevada Territory]] from part of [[Utah Territory]] in 1861.

By January 1863, the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] (CPRR) had begun laying tracks east from [[Sacramento, California]], eventually connecting with the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] at [[Promontory, Utah]], to form the [[First transcontinental railroad]]. Lake deeded land to the CPRR in exchange for its promise to build a depot at Lake's Crossing. In 1864, Washoe County was consolidated with [[Roop County, Nevada|Roop County]], and Lake's Crossing became the county's largest town. Lake had earned himself the title "founder of Reno".<ref>Guy Louis Rocha, "Reno's First Robber Baron," ''Nevada Magazine'' 40,2 (March–April 1980), p. 28.</ref> Once the railroad station was established, the town of Reno officially came into being on May 9, 1868.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://reno.gov/government/departments/community-development-department/historic-resources/history-of-reno |title=History of Reno |publisher=City of Reno |access-date=2014-07-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714125111/http://reno.gov/government/departments/community-development-department/historic-resources/history-of-reno |archive-date=July 14, 2014 }}</ref> CPRR construction superintendent [[Charles Crocker]] named the community after Major General [[Jesse L. Reno|Jesse Lee Reno]], a Union officer killed in the Civil War at the [[Battle of South Mountain]].

In 1871, Reno became the county seat of the newly expanded Washoe County, replacing the county seat in [[Washoe City, Nevada|Washoe City]]. However, political power in Nevada remained with the mining communities, first Virginia City and later [[Tonopah, Nevada|Tonopah]] and [[Goldfield, Nevada|Goldfield]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=NEVADA HISTORICAL SOCIETY QUARTERLY |url=https://epubs.nsla.nv.gov/statepubs/epubs/210777-1996-3Fall.pdf |access-date=11 September 2023 |website=epubs.nsla.nv.gov}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Cegavske|first=Barbara .K.|title=Political History of Nevada|year=2016|location=Nevada}}</ref>

The extension of the [[Virginia and Truckee Railroad]] to Reno in 1872 provided a boost to the new city's economy. In the following decades, Reno continued to grow and prosper as a business and agricultural center and became the principal settlement on the transcontinental railroad between Sacramento and [[Salt Lake City]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Visit Reno, Nevada!|url=https://www.iise.org/Annual2/Details.aspx?id=21972|website=www.iise.org|access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref>
As the mining boom waned early in the 20th century, Nevada's centers of political and business activity shifted to the nonmining communities, especially Reno and [[Las Vegas]]. Nevada is still the third-largest gold producer in the world, after [[South Africa]] and [[Australia]]; the state yielded 6.9% of the world's supply in 2005 world gold production.<ref>{{cite web|author=John_O'Neill_100001295309124 |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/gold-hits-record-high |title=ReviewJournal.com – News – Gold hits record high |publisher=Lvrj.com |date=January 9, 2008 }}</ref>

The [[Reno Arch]] was erected on Virginia Street in 1926 to promote the upcoming Transcontinental Highways Exposition of 1927. The arch included the words "Nevada's Transcontinental Highways Exposition" and the dates of the exposition. After the exposition, the Reno City Council decided to keep the arch as a permanent downtown gateway, and Mayor E.E. Roberts asked the citizens of Reno to suggest a slogan for the arch. No acceptable slogan was received until a $100 prize was offered, and G.A. Burns of Sacramento was declared the winner on March 14, 1929, with "Reno, the Biggest Little City in the World".<ref name =shoreno>{{cite book|title= A short history of Reno |first=Barbara|last= Land|author2=Myrick Land |page=67|publisher= University of Nevada Press|year=1995 |location=Reno, Nevada|isbn =978-0-87417-262-1}}</ref>

===The divorce capital of the world===
In the early twentieth century Nevada became a popular destination for [[migratory divorce]] in an era when most states had highly restrictive laws on the subject. Legislation passed in 1931 completed the gradual reduction of residency requirement from six months to six weeks, and Reno openly advertised itself as the "Divorce Capital of the World."  Nevada's laws, which were fairly progressive for the time, allowed numerous grounds for divorce and Reno's courts quickly gained a reputation for handling cases with both celerity and sympathy for those seeking to "untie the knot." From the 1930s through the 1960s Reno became synonymous with speedy divorce, often referred to colloquially as "the six week cure." During these decades the city's reputation drew thousands of divorcees annually, and they in turn became an important part of the local economy. These temporary residents flocked to hotels, [[boarding house|boardinghouses]], and [[dude ranches|hospitality ranches]], many of which catered primarily to those waiting out the six week residency requirement before their court date.<ref name=Brean>{{cite web|author=Brean, Henry|url=https://www.rgj.com/story/life/2017/09/18/rise-and-fall-renos-quickie-divorce-industry/677065001/|title=The rise and fall of Reno's quickie divorce industry|agency=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|work=[[Reno Gazette-Journal]]|date=2017-09-18|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref> Numerous local businesses openly courted these visitors, such as [[R. Herz & Bro]], a jewelry store that offered ring resetting services to the recently divorced and the luxurious [[El Cortez (Reno)|El Cortez Hotel]], which was built in part to accommodate the more affluent among Reno's six week guests.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ad for R. Herz & Bro. Jewelers|url=http://renodivorcehistory.org/library/ad-for-r-herz-bro-jewelers/|access-date=2021-09-01|website=Reno Divorce History}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Harmon|first=Mella|title=El Cortez Hotel|url=https://renohistorical.org/items/show/5|access-date=2021-09-01|website=Reno Historical|language=en}}</ref> The majority of those who came to Reno for divorce were women as Nevada did not require both parties in a divorce case to be present in court, and men often could not take that much time off from work. Although new "residents" seeking divorce were required to swear under oath that they intended to make Nevada their permanent home, most left soon after obtaining their divorce decree, which often occurred on the same day as the initial court hearing.<ref name="Brean" />

In addition to tens of thousands of ordinary people, Reno also became a major destination for celebrities, and the very wealthy looking to end their marriages as quickly as possible. Some of the many famous personages who got divorced in Reno include [[Mary Pickford]], [[Jack Dempsey]], General [[Douglas MacArthur]], [[Carol Lombard]], [[Tallulah Bankhead]], [[Adlai Stevenson II]], [[Lana Turner]], [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Georges Simenon]], [[Rita Hayworth]], [[Gloria Vanderbilt]] and [[Cornelius Vanderbilt IV]]. The latter was married seven times and had five of his six divorces in Nevada. Mr. Vanderbilt was so taken with Reno that, unlike most migrant divorcees, he eventually settled there permanently.<ref name="Smithsonian Magazine">{{Cite web |last=Wernick |first=Robert |date=June 1996 |title=Where You Went if You Really Had to Get Unhitched |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/where-you-went-if-you-really-had-to-get-unhitched-1-41543097/#:~:text=Publicized%20in%20a%20long%20string,capital%20of%20the%20Western%20world. |access-date=2024-03-15}}</ref><ref name="Reno Divorce History">{{Cite web |date=2014 |title=Famous people divorced in Reno |url=https://renodivorcehistory.org/research/famous-people-divorced-in-reno/#:~:text=John%20Carradine%20(actor).,Nelson%20in%20Reno%20in%201937. |access-date=2024-03-15 |website=Reno Divorce History}}</ref>

In the 1939 film ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'', Reno and its divorce culture serve as a backdrop to a significant part of the plot. [[Ernie Pyle]] once wrote in one of his columns, "All the people you saw on the streets in Reno were obviously there to get divorces." In [[Ayn Rand]]'s novel ''[[The Fountainhead]]'', published in 1943, the New York-based female protagonist tells a friend, "I am going to Reno," which was understood as declaring their intention to get a divorce.<ref name=cultureamerica>{{cite book|last= Barber |first =Alicia  |title =Reno's big gamble: image and reputation in the biggest little city|publisher =University Press of Kansas|year=2008 |isbn= 978-0-7006-1594-0 }}</ref>

The divorce business eventually died out during the 1970s, as other states began relaxing their laws, and especially with the widespread introduction of [[no fault divorce]].<ref name=Brean/>

===Gambling and modern Reno===
Reno took a leap forward when the state of Nevada legalized open [[gambling]] on March 19, 1931, at the same time as it liberalized its divorce laws. The statewide push for legal Nevada gaming was led by Reno entrepreneur Bill Graham, who owned the Bank Club Casino in Reno, which was on Center Street. No other state offered legalized casino gaming like Nevada had in the 1930s, and [[casino]]s such as the Bank Club and Palace were popular.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Barber |first=Alicia |title=Tour {{!}} Historic Gambling Clubs and Casinos |url=https://renohistorical.org/tours/show/19 |access-date=2024-07-04 |website=Reno Historical |language=en-US}}</ref> A few states had legal [[Parimutuel betting|parimutuel]] [[horse racing]], but no other state had legal casino gambling.

Within a few years, the Bank Club, owned by [[George Wingfield]], Bill Graham, and Jim McKay, was the state's largest employer and the largest casino in the world. Wingfield owned most of the buildings in town that housed gaming and took a percentage of the profits, along with his rent.<ref>Moe, Al W. ''The Roots of Reno'', [https://www.amazon.com/Roots-Reno-Al-W-Moe/dp/143921199X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1322253439&sr=1-1Booksurge], 2008, p.153</ref>

As the divorce industry declined, gambling became the major Reno industry. While gaming pioneers such as "Pappy" and Harold Smith of Harold's Club and Bill Harrah of the soon-to-dominate Harrah's Casino set up shop in the 1930s, the war years of the 1940s cemented Reno as the place to play for two decades.<ref>Moe, Al W.

At 1:03&nbsp;pm, on February 5, 1957, two explosions, caused by [[natural gas]] leaking into the maze of pipes and ditches under the city, and an ensuing fire, destroyed five buildings in the vicinity of Sierra and First Streets along the Truckee River. The disaster killed two people and injured 49. The first explosion hit under the block of shops on the west side of Sierra Street (now the site of the Century Riverside), the second, across Sierra Street, now the site of the Palladio.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.historicreno.org/media/custom/docs/FPv18n1.pdf | title = Disaster on Sierra Street | last = Fenwick | first = Jerry | date = 2015-01-01 |publisher = Historic Reno Preservation Society | access-date = 2024-07-03}}</ref>

The presence of a main east–west rail line, the emerging interstate highway system, favorable state tax climate, and relatively inexpensive land created good conditions for warehousing and distribution of goods.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Town Building (1868-1912) {{!}} 4th Street Prater Way History Project |url=https://4thprater.onlinenevada.org/era/town-building |access-date=2024-07-04 |website=4thprater.onlinenevada.org}}</ref>

In the 1980s, [[Native American gaming|Indian gaming]] rules were relaxed, and starting in 2000, Californian Native casinos began to cut into Reno casino revenues.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/us/with-gambling-in-decline-reno-struggles-to-reinvent-itself.html | work=The New York Times | first=Norimitsu | last=Onishi | title=With Gambling in Decline, Reno Struggles to Reinvent Itself | date=July 14, 2012}}</ref> Major new construction projects have been completed in the Reno and Sparks areas.

==Geography==

===Geology===
[[File:Dog Valley.jpg|thumb|Dog Valley, west of Reno, an area of active faulting]]
Reno is just east of the [[Sierra Nevada]], on the western edge of the [[Great Basin]] at an elevation of about {{convert|4400|ft}} [[Height above sea level|above sea level]]. Numerous [[fault (geology)|faults]] exist throughout the region. Most of these are [[Dip-slip faults|normal]] (vertical motion) faults associated with the uplift of the various mountain ranges, including the Sierra Nevada.

In [[2008 Reno earthquakes|February 2008, an earthquake swarm]] began to occur, lasting for several months, with the largest quake registering at 4.9 on the [[Richter magnitude scale]], although some geologic estimates put it at 5.0. The earthquakes were centered on the Somersett community in western Reno near [[Mogul, Nevada|Mogul]] and [[Verdi, Nevada|Verdi]]. Many homes in these areas were damaged.<ref>{{cite news| title=Swarm of earthquakes shakes Reno area| date=April 30, 2008| url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2008/04/30/20080430renoquakes0430-ON.html| author=Ashley Powers|author2=Thomas H.

The unique high desert geological features cause many to "describe Nevada as a rockhound's paradise .... access to millions of acres of government land" allows geologists, miners, and amateur rockhounds in Nevada "to hunt to your heart's content .... being able to find agate, opal, jasper, fossils, fluorescent minerals, obsidian, chalcedony, wonderstone, malachite, petrified wood, limb casts, and much more means paradise."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kappele |first1=William |title=Rockhounding Nevada: A Guide to the State's Best Rockhounding Sites |date=2019 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1-4930-3402-4 |section=Introduction |edition=3rd}}</ref>

The Reno area is often subject to [[wildfire]]s that cause property damage and sometimes loss of life. In August 1960, the Donner Ridge fire resulted in a loss of electricity to the city for four days.<ref>{{cite book| title=Weather and Climate of the Reno-Carson City-Lake Tahoe Region: Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology Special Publication 34| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-BWgg69xcGsC&pg=PA53| year=2007| publisher=NV Bureau of Mines & Geology| isbn=978-1-888035-11-7|page=53|access-date=2013-01-16}}</ref> In November 2011, arcing from powerlines caused a fire in Caughlin in southwest Reno that destroyed 26 homes and killed one man.

[[Wetland]]s are an important part of the Reno/Tahoe area. They act as a natural filter for the solids that come out of the water treatment plant. Plant roots absorb nutrients from the water and naturally filter it. Wetlands are home to over 75% of the species in the [[Great Basin]]. The area's wetlands are at risk of being destroyed due to development around the city. While developers build on top of the wetlands they fill them with soil, destroying the habitat they create for the plants and animals. Washoe County has devised a plan that will help protect these ecosystems: mitigation. In the future, when developers try to build over a wetland, they will be responsible for creating another wetland near Washoe Lake.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

===Climate===
Reno has a [[Cold semi-arid climate|cold semi-arid]] climate ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''BSk''), bordering a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa'') to the west. It experiences moderately cold winters and hot summers; it is influenced by the [[Sierra Nevada]] mountains to the west and the more arid [[Great Basin]] to the east.<ref>O'Hara, B. F. (2006). [https://www.weather.gov/media/wrh/online_publications/TMs/TM-276.pdf Climate of Reno, Nevada]. p. 1</ref> It is situated across a varied geographic landscape, which extends from the foothills of the Sierra Nevada into the Truckee River valley. While Reno experiences a [[rain shadow]] effect from the surrounding mountains, its western portions can receive three to four times as much precipitation as those extending eastward.<ref name=":02">O'Hara, B. F. (2006). [https://www.weather.gov/media/wrh/online_publications/TMs/TM-276.pdf Climate of Reno, Nevada]. p. 4</ref> Annual rainfall patterns in Reno adhere to a Mediterranean climate, with most precipitation occurring in fall, winter, and spring, followed by long, hot, dry summers.<ref name=":02" /> However, Reno's average annual rainfall is slightly lower than that of Californian cities more typically associated with Mediterranean climates. The area's low [[evapotranspiration]] stemming from its moderate annual average temperature also bears similarity to semi-arid climates found in Nevada's Great Basin.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014JD022138 | doi=10.1002/2014JD022138 | title=Accuracy of near-surface aerosol extinction determined from columnar aerosol optical depth measurements in Reno, NV, USA | date=2014 | last1=Loría-Salazar | first1=S.

The monthly daily average temperature ranges from {{convert|36.2|°F|1}} in December to {{convert|77.2|°F|1}} in July, with the [[diurnal temperature variation]] occasionally reaching {{convert|40|F-change}} in summer, still lower than much of the high desert to the east. There are 6.0 days of {{convert|100|°F|0}}+ highs, 65 days of {{convert|90|°F|0}}+ highs, 1.6 days with {{convert|70|°F|0}}+ lows, and 1.9 days with sub-{{convert|10|°F|0}} lows annually; the temperature reaches or dips below the freezing point on 122 days, and does not rise above freezing on only 4.1 of those days.<ref name="NOAA">{{cite web |title=NowData – NOAA Online Weather Data |url=https://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=rev |access-date=October 13, 2021 |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]}}</ref> The all-time record high temperature is {{convert|108|°F|0}}, which occurred on July 10 and 11, 2002, again on July 5, 2007, and again on July 16, 2023. The all-time record low temperature is {{convert|-17|°F|0}}, which occurred on January 21, 1916; the lowest temperature recorded at the airport is {{convert|-16|°F|0}}, which occurred on four occasions, most recently on February 7, 1989.<ref name="NOAA" /> In addition, the region is windy throughout the year; observers such as [[Mark Twain]] have commented about the "Washoe Zephyr", northwestern Nevada's distinctive wind.

Annual precipitation has ranged from {{convert|1.55|in|mm|1}} in 1947 to {{convert|13.73|in|mm|1}} in 2017. The most precipitation in one month was {{convert|6.76|in|mm|1}} in January 1916 and the most precipitation in 24 hours was {{convert|2.71|in|mm|1}} on January 28, 1903. At [[Reno–Tahoe International Airport]], where records go back to 1937, the most precipitation in one month was {{convert|5.57|in|mm|1}} in January 2017 and the most precipitation in 24 hours was {{convert|2.29|in|mm|1}} on January 21, 1943.<ref name="NOAA" />

Most [[precipitation (meteorology)|rainfall]] occurs in winter and spring. Summer thunderstorms can occur between April and October. The eastern side of town and the mountains east of Reno tend to be prone to thunderstorms more often, and these storms may be severe because an afternoon downslope west wind, called a "[[Washoe Zephyr]]", can develop in the Sierra Nevada, causing air to be pulled down in the Sierra Nevada and Reno, destroying or preventing thunderstorms, but the same wind can push air upward against the Virginia Range and other mountain ranges east of Reno, creating powerful thunderstorms.<ref>{{cite web |title=Reno, NV |url=http://www.visitrenotahoe.com/destination/reno |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106184552/http://www.visitrenotahoe.com/destination/reno |archive-date=January 6, 2009 |access-date=June 1, 2010 |publisher=Reno Tahoe Visitors website}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Brian O'Hara |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-BWgg69xcGsC&pg=PA71 |title=Weather and Climate of the Reno-Carson City-Lake Tahoe Region |author2=Gary Barbato |author3=John James |author4=Heather Angeloff |author5=Tom Cylke |publisher=NV Bureau of Mines & Geology |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-888035-11-7 |page=71}}</ref>

Winter snowfall is usually light to moderate, but can be heavy some days, averaging {{convert|20.9|in|cm|0}} annually. Snowfall varies with the lowest amounts (roughly 19–23&nbsp;inches annually) at the lowest part of the valley at and east of the airport at {{convert|4404|ft}}, while the foothills of the [[Carson Range]] to the west ranging from {{convert|4700|to|5600|ft}} in elevation just a few miles west of downtown can receive two to three times as much annual snowfall. The mountains of the [[Virginia Range]] to the east, meanwhile, can receive more summer thunderstorms and precipitation, and around twice as much annual snowfall above {{convert|5500|ft}}. However, snowfall increases in the Virginia Range are less dramatic as elevation climbs than in the Carson Range to the west, because the Virginia Range is well within the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada and Carson Range. The most snowfall in Reno in one winter was {{convert|72.3|in|cm|0}} in 1915–1916, with an astonishing {{convert|65.7|in|cm|0}} in January, the most in a calendar month, as well as {{convert|22.5|in|cm|0}} on January 17, the most in a calendar day; the most snowfall in a calendar year was {{convert|82.3|in|cm|0}} in 1916.<ref name="NOAA" />

Until the 1960s, Reno was the gambling capital of the United States, but Las Vegas' rapid growth, [[American Airlines]]' 2000 buyout of [[Reno Air]], and the growth of [[Native American gaming]] in California have reduced its gambling economy. Older casinos were torn down ([[Mapes Hotel]], [[Fitzgeralds Gaming|Fitzgerald's Nevada Club]], Primadonna, Horseshoe Club, [[Harold's Club]], Palace Club), or smaller casinos like the [[Comstock Hotel & Casino|Comstock]], [[Sundowner (hotel and casino)|Sundowner]], [[The Montage Reno|Golden Phoenix]], [[3rd Street Flats|Kings Inn]], Money Tree, Virginian, and Riverboat were either closed or were converted into residential units.

Because of its location, Reno has traditionally drawn the majority of its California tourists and gamblers from the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] while [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] has historically served more tourists from [[Southern California]] and the [[Phoenix metropolitan area|Phoenix]] area.

Several local large hotel casinos have shown significant growth and have moved gaming further away from the downtown core. These larger hotel casinos are the [[Atlantis Casino Resort|Atlantis]], the [[Peppermill Reno|Peppermill]] and the [[Grand Sierra Resort]]. The Peppermill was chosen as the most outstanding Reno gaming/hotel property by ''Casino Player'' and ''Nevada'' magazines. In 2005, the Peppermill Reno began a $300&nbsp;million [[Tuscany|Tuscan]]-themed expansion.

Reno holds several events throughout the year to draw tourists to the area. They include [[Hot August Nights]]<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.hotaugustnights.net/ |title=Hot August Nights |publisher=Hot August Nights |access-date=August 12, 2010}}</ref> (a classic car convention), Street Vibrations (a motorcycle fan gathering and rally), [[The Great Reno Balloon Race]], a [[Cinco de Mayo]] celebration, [[bowling]] tournaments (held in the [[National Bowling Stadium]]), and the [[Reno Air Races]].

Several large commercial developments were constructed during the mid-2000s boom, such as [[The Summit (Reno, Nevada)|The Summit]] in 2007 and [[Outlets at Legends|Legends at Sparks Marina]] in 2008.

Reno is the location of the [[corporate headquarters]] for several companies, including [[Braeburn Capital]], Hamilton, [[Server Technology]], [[EE Technologies]], [[Caesars Entertainment (2020)|Caesars Entertainment]], and [[Port of Subs]]. Companies based in the [[Reno metropolitan area, Nevada|Reno metropolitan area]] include [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]] and [[U.S. Ordnance]]. [[International Game Technology]], [[Bally Technologies]] and GameTech have a development and manufacturing presence.

Since the turn of the 21st century, greater Reno saw an influx of technology companies entering the area, following major initiatives and investments by investors from [[Seattle]] & the [[Bay Area]]. The first one in 1999 was [[Amazon.com]] in [[Fernley, Nevada|Fernley]]. After the [[Great Recession]], the state placed an increased focus on economic development.

Reno is home to the [[Reno Aces]], the [[minor league baseball]] [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] affiliate of the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], playing in [[Greater Nevada Field]], a downtown ballpark opened in 2009. Reno has hosted multiple [[Professional sports|professional baseball]] teams in the past, most under the [[Reno Silver Sox]] name. The Reno Astros, a former professional, unaffiliated baseball team, played at [[Moana Stadium]] until 2009.

In basketball, the [[Reno Bighorns]] of the [[NBA G League]] played at the [[Reno Events Center]] from 2008 to 2018.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nba.com/dleague/reno/ |title=NBA Development League: The D-League Expands to Reno |publisher=Nbareno.com |access-date=2013-01-16 }}</ref> They were primarily an affiliate of the [[Sacramento Kings]] throughout its existence. The Sacramento Kings bought the team in 2016 and moved the franchise to become the [[Stockton Kings]] in 2018.

Reno is host to both amateur and professional combat sporting events such as [[mixed martial arts]] and [[boxing]]. The "[[Jack Johnson (boxer)#"Fight of the Century"|Fight of the Century]]" between [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] and [[James J.

Reno expected to be the future home of an [[ECHL]] ice hockey team, named the [[Reno Raiders]], but construction on a suitable arena never began. The franchise was dormant since 1998, when it was named the [[Reno Rage]], and earlier the [[Reno Renegades]], and played in the now-defunct [[West Coast Hockey League]] (WCHL). In 2016, Reno was removed from the ECHL's Future Markets page.

The [[Reno–Tahoe Open]] is northern Nevada's only [[PGA Tour]] event, held at Montrêux Golf & Country Club in Reno. As part of the [[FedEx Cup]], the tournament follows 132 PGA Tour professionals competing for a share of the event's $3&nbsp;million purse. The Reno-Tahoe Open Foundation has donated more than $1.8&nbsp;million to local charities.

Reno has a college sports scene, with the [[Nevada Wolf Pack]] appearing in football bowl games and an Associated Press and Coaches Poll Top Ten ranking in [[Nevada Wolf Pack men's basketball|basketball]] in 2018.
[[File:Reno River Festival at Reno Whitewater Park.jpg|thumb|Reno Whitewater Festival at the whitewater park in Reno]]

In 2004, the city completed a $1.5&nbsp;million whitewater park on the Truckee River in downtown Reno which hosts [[whitewater]] events throughout the year. The course runs Class 2 and 3 rapids with year-round public access.

==Parks and recreation==
[[File:Virginia Lake Reno Nevada USA walking dog.jpg|left|thumb|Virginia Lake is a popular place for people to walk their dog in Reno.]]
[[File:Truckee River Reno Nevada 4th of July 2018.jpg|thumb|upright|River rafting on the 4th of July, 2018 on the [[Truckee River]]]]

Reno is home to a variety of recreation activities including both seasonal and year-round. In the summer, Reno locals can be found near three major bodies of water: Lake Tahoe, the [[Truckee River]], and Pyramid Lake. The Truckee River originates at Lake Tahoe and flows west to east through the center of downtown Reno before terminating at Pyramid Lake to the north. The river is a major part of [[Artown]], held in the summer at Wingfield Park. [[Washoe Lake]] is a popular kite and [[windsurfing]] location because of its high wind speeds during the summer.

Skiing and snowboarding are among the most popular winter sports and draw many tourists. There are 18 ski resorts<ref>{{cite web|title=About Reno-Sparks |url=http://www.reno-sparkschamber.org/visitation.htm |publisher=Reno Sparks Chamber of Commerce |access-date=September 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727234333/http://www.reno-sparkschamber.org/visitation.htm |archive-date=July 27, 2011 }}</ref> (8 major resorts) as close as {{convert|11|mi}} and as far as {{convert|98|mi}} from the Reno–Tahoe International Airport, including [[Northstar California]], [[Sierra-at-Tahoe]], [[Alpine Meadows, California|Alpine Meadows]], [[Palisades Tahoe]], [[Sugar Bowl Ski Resort|Sugar Bowl]], [[Diamond Peak (ski area)|Diamond Peak]], [[Heavenly Mountain Resort|Heavenly Mountain]], and [[Mount Rose Ski Tahoe|Mount Rose]]. Other popular Reno winter activities include snowshoeing, ice skating, and snowmobiling. There are many bike paths to ride in the summer time. Lake Tahoe hosts international bike competitions each summer.

===Air races===

The [[Reno Air Races]], also known as the National Championship Air Races, are held each September at the [[Reno Stead Airport]]. 2023 will mark the final year for the races in Reno after 60 years, as a result of the Reno Tahoe Airport Authority decision to sundown the event, citing growth around the airport amongst other nonspecific concerns not stated from the RTAA<ref name="USA">{{cite news |url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/2013/09/16/reno-air-races-fiftieth-anniversary/2820923/ |title= Celebrating 50 years of the Reno Air Races |work= [[Reno Gazette-Journal]] |date= September 16, 2013 |access-date= October 18, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://airrace.org/about-us/faqs/ |title= FAQs |work= The Reno Air Racing Association |access-date= October 18, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://airrace.org/|title= National Championship Air Races Reno Air Races |access-date= May 7, 2023}}</ref>

==Government==
{{see also|List of mayors of Reno, Nevada}}
Reno has a democratic municipal government. The [[city council]] is the core of the government, with seven members. Five of these council people represent districts of Reno, and are vetted in the [[Partisan primary|primary]] by the citizens of each district. In general, the top two vote earners in each ward make the ballot for the citywide election. The other two council members are the at-large member, who represents the entire city, and the mayor, who is elected by the people of the city. The council has several duties, including setting priorities for the city, promoting communication with the public, planning development, and redevelopment.

There is an elected [[city attorney]] who is responsible for civil and criminal cases. The City Attorney represents the city government in court, and prosecutes misdemeanors.

The city's charter calls for a [[council-manager government|council-manager]] form of government, meaning the council appoints only two positions, the [[city manager]], who implements and enforces the policies and programs the council approves, and the [[city clerk]]. The city manager is in charge of the budget and workforce for all city programs. The city clerk, who records the proceedings of the council, makes appointments for the council, and makes sure efficient copying and printing services are available.

In 2010, there was a ballot question asking whether the Reno city government and the Washoe County government should explore the idea of becoming one combined governmental body.<ref>{{cite news |title=Combining local governments is questioned on ballot issue |first=Susan |last=Voyles |date=October 24, 2010 |work=Reno Gazette-Journal |page=10A}}</ref> Fifty-four&nbsp;percent of voters approved of the ballot measure to make an inquiry into consolidating the governments.<ref>{{cite news |title=Election Results: Nevada |work=The New York Times |access-date=November 3, 2010 |url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2010/results/nevada }}</ref>

===Fire department===
The city of Reno is protected by the Reno Fire Department (RFD) manning 14 fire stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reno.gov/index.aspx?page=189 |title=City of Reno: Fire Department |publisher=Reno.gov |date=2013-03-20 |access-date=2013-05-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118012232/https://www.reno.gov/index.aspx?page=189 |archive-date=January 18, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reno.gov/index.aspx?page=253 |title=City of Reno: Administration |publisher=Reno.gov |date=2013-03-20 |access-date=2013-05-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119161713/http://reno.gov/index.aspx?page=253 |archive-date=January 19, 2013 }}</ref>

The Reno Fire Department (RFD) provides all-risk emergency service to the City of Reno residents. All-risk emergency service is the national model of municipal fire departments, providing the services needed in the most efficient way possible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reno.gov/government/departments/fire-department|title=Reno Fire Department – City of Reno|website=www.reno.gov}}</ref>

The department provides paramedic-level service to the citizens and visitors of Reno. This is the highest level of emergency medical care available in the field.

In addition to responding to fires, whether they occur in structures, vegetation/brush or vehicles, the fire department also provides rescue capabilities for almost any type of emergency situation.

This includes quick and efficient emergency medical care for the citizens; a hazardous materials team capable of identifying unknown materials and controlling a release disaster; and preparedness and management of large-scale incidents.

Maintaining this level of service requires nearly constant training of personnel. This training maintains both the skills needed to operate safely in emergency environments and the physical fitness necessary to reduce the likelihood and severity of injuries.

The minimum annual-training requirement to maintain firefighting and medical skills is 240 hours per year. Special teams and company-level drills add significantly to that number of hours.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://issuu.com/cityofreno/docs/2017renofiredepartment-annualreport|title=2017 Reno Fire Department: Annual Report by City of Reno - Issuu|website=issuu.com|date=April 3, 2017 }}</ref>

==Transportation==
[[File:I80downtownreno.jpg|thumb|[[Interstate 80 in Nevada|I-80]] in Downtown Reno|alt=A 6-lane freeway passing under a series of underpasses]]

===Roads===
Reno was historically served by the [[Victory Highway]] and a branch of the [[Lincoln Highway]]. After the formation of the [[United States Numbered Highways|U.S. Numbered Highways]] system, [[U.S. Route 40 in Nevada|U.S. Route 40]] was routed along 4th Street through downtown Reno, before being replaced by [[Interstate 80 in Nevada|Interstate 80]]. The primary north–south highway through Reno is [[U.S. Route 395 in Nevada|U.S. Route 395]]/[[Interstate 580 (Nevada)|Interstate 580]].

===Bus===
The [[Regional Transportation Commission of Washoe County]] (RTC) has a bus system that provides intracity buses, intercity buses to Carson City, and an on-demand shuttle service for disabled persons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rtcwashoe.com/public-transportation-5 |title=RTC Washoe |publisher=RTC Washoe |access-date=August 12, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130140520/http://rtcwashoe.com/public-transportation-5 |archive-date=November 30, 2010  }}</ref> The system has its main terminal on 4th Street in downtown Reno and secondary terminals in Sparks and at [[Meadowood Mall]] in south Reno.

Numerous shuttle and excursion services are offered connecting the [[Reno–Tahoe International Airport]] to various destinations:
* North Lake Tahoe Express provides connecting shuttle service to North Lake Tahoe Resorts
* South Tahoe Airporter provides connecting shuttle service to [[South Lake Tahoe, California|South Lake Tahoe]] resorts.
* [[Eastern Sierra Transit Authority]] provides shuttles to destinations south along the US-395 corridor in California, such as [[Mammoth Mountain]] and [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]]

[[File:Circus Circus Reno tram (people mover).jpg|thumb|right|The tram at [[Circus Circus Reno]]]]
Reno was historically a stopover along the [[First transcontinental railroad]]; the modern [[Overland Route (Union Pacific Railroad)|Overland Route]] continues to run through Reno. Reno was additionally the southern terminus of the [[Nevada–California–Oregon Railway]] (NCO) and the northern terminus of the [[Virginia and Truckee Railroad]]. Using the NCO depot and right of way, the [[Western Pacific Railroad]] also provided rail service to Reno. In the early 20th century, Reno also had a modest [[Streetcars in Reno|streetcar system]]. Downtown Reno has two historic train depots, the inactive [[Nevada-California-Oregon Railroad Depot]] and the active Amtrak depot at [[Reno station]], originally built by the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newsreview.com/reno/we-told-you-so/content?oid=2695815|title=We told you so |first=Willie |last=Albright |date=July 14, 2011|work=[[Reno News & Review]]|access-date=July 23, 2017}}</ref>

[[Amtrak]] provides daily passenger service to Reno via the ''[[California Zephyr]]'' at Reno station and via multiple [[Amtrak Thruway]] buses that connect to trains departing from [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]].

===Air===
The city is served by [[Reno–Tahoe International Airport]], with general aviation traffic handled by [[Reno Stead Airport]]. Reno–Tahoe International Airport is the second busiest commercial airport in the state of Nevada after [[Harry Reid International Airport]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. Reno was the hub and headquarters of the defunct airline [[Reno Air]].

==Utilities==
The [[Truckee Meadows Water Authority]] provides potable water for the city. The [[Truckee River]] is the primary water source. It supplies Reno with {{convert|80|e6U.S.gal|lk=out}} of water a day during the summer, and {{convert|40|e6U.S.gal}} of water per day in the winter. The two [[water treatment]] plants are Chalk Bluff and Glendale. The Chalk Bluff plant's main intakes are west of Reno and south of [[Verdi, Nevada|Verdi]], with the water flowing through a series of [[flume]]s and ditches to the plant. Alternative intakes are below the plant along the banks of the Truckee River itself. The Glendale plant is alongside the river, and is fed by a rock and concrete rubble [[diversion dam]] a short distance upstream.<ref name="tmwa">{{cite web| url=http://tmwa.com/| title=Truckee Meadows Water Authority}}</ref>

[[Sewage treatment]] for most of the Truckee Meadows region takes place at the Truckee Meadows Water Reclamation Facility at the eastern edge of the valley. Treated effluent returns to the Truckee River by way of Steamboat Creek.<ref name="tmwrf">{{cite web| url=http://cityofsparks.us/departments/community-services/tmwrf| title=Truckee Meadows Water Reclamation Facility| access-date=January 16, 2013| archive-date=February 7, 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207120900/http://cityofsparks.us/departments/community-services/tmwrf}}</ref> In the 1990s, this capacity was increased from 20 to 30&nbsp;million U.S. gallons (70 to 110&nbsp;million liters) per day. While treated, the effluent contains suspended solids, [[nitrogen]], and [[phosphorus]], aggravating water-quality concerns of the river and its receiving waters of [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]]. Local agencies working with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] have developed several watershed management strategies to accommodate this expanded discharge. To accomplish this successful outcome, the [[DSSAM Model]] was developed and calibrated for the Truckee River to analyze the most cost-effective available management strategy set.<ref>C. Michael Hogan, Marc Papineau et al. 1987. ''Development of a dynamic water quality simulation model for the Truckee River'', Earth Metrics Inc., Environmental Protection Agency Technology Series, Washington D.C.</ref> The resulting management strategies included measures such as [[land use]] controls in the Lake Tahoe basin, urban [[surface runoff|runoff]] controls in Reno and Sparks, and [[best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]] for wastewater discharge.{{cn|date=July 2024}} Golf courses in Reno have been using treated [[effluent sewer|effluent]] water rather than treated water from one of Reno's water plants.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

[[NV Energy]], formerly Sierra Pacific, provides electric power and natural gas. Power comes from multiple sources, including [[Tracy-Clark Station]] to the east, and the [[Steamboat Springs, Nevada|Steamboat Springs]] [[binary cycle]] power plants at the southern end of town.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Steamboat Springs Geothermal Field {{!}} ONE|url=https://www.onlinenevada.org/articles/steamboat-springs-geothermal-field|access-date=2021-09-12|website=www.onlinenevada.org}}</ref>
