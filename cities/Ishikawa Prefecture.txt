He defeated six time incumbent [[Masanori Tanimoto]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14571663 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220403104930/https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14571663 |archive-date=April 3, 2022 |title=Hase wins governor's race in Ishikawa after LDP split, grudge &#124; the Asahi Shimbun: Breaking News, Japan News and Analysis}}</ref> Prior to his defeat, Tanimoto was one of two governors who were in their sixth term nationwide, the other being [[Masaru Hashimoto]] of Ibaraki. Hase is only the fifth governor of Ishikawa since 1947 when prefectural governors became elected offices, as Tanimoto had held the governorship for twenty eight years, first coming to office in 1994, succeeding [[Yōichi Nakanishi]], who had served from 1963 until his death in 1994.
