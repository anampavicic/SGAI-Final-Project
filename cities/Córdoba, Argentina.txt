Córdoba was founded as a settlement on 6 July 1573 by [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] [[conquistador]] [[Jerónimo Luis de Cabrera]], who named it after the Spanish city of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]]. It was one of the early Spanish colonial capitals of the region of present-day Argentina (the oldest Argentine city is [[Santiago del Estero]], founded in 1553). The [[National University of Córdoba]], the oldest university of the country, was founded in 1613 by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit Order]], and Córdoba has earned the nickname {{lang | es | La Docta}} ("the learned").

Córdoba has many historical monuments preserved from the period of [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonial rule]], especially buildings of the [[Catholic Church]] such as the [[Jesuit Block]] (Spanish: ''Manzana Jesuítica''), declared in 2000 as a [[World Heritage Site]] by UNESCO,<ref>{{cite web|author= UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url= https://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&id_site=995 |title= UNESCO |publisher= Whc.unesco.org |date= 2000-11-30 |access-date= 2014-04-22}}</ref> which consists of a group of buildings dating from the 17th century, including the [[Colegio Nacional de Monserrat]] and the colonial university campus. The campus belongs today to the historical museum of the [[National University of Córdoba]], which has been the second-largest university in the country since the early years of the 20th century (after the [[University of Buenos Aires]]), in number of students, faculty, and academic programs. Córdoba is also known for its historical movements, such as the [[Cordobazo]] of May 1969 and {{lang | es | La Reforma del '18}} (known as the [[University Revolution]] in English) of 1918.

==History==
===Early settlements===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
In 1570 the [[Viceroy of Peru]], [[Francisco de Toledo]], entrusted the Spanish settler [[Jerónimo Luis de Cabrera]] with the task of founding and populating a settlement in the [[Punilla Valley]]. Cabrera sent an expedition of 48 men to the territory of the [[Comechingones]]. He divided the principal column that entered through the north of the provincial territory at [[Villa María, Córdoba|Villa María]].
The expedition of one hundred men set foot on what today is Córdoba on 24 June 1573. Cabrera called the nearby river San Juan (today [[Suquía]]). The settlement was officially founded on 6 July of the same year and named {{lang | es | Córdoba de la Nueva Andalucía}}, possibly in honour of ancestors of the founder's wife, who originally came from [[Córdoba, Spain]]. The foundation of the city took place on the left bank of the river on the advice of Francisco de Torres.
[[File:Primera traza de Córdoba.jpg|thumb|left|Depiction of the first map of Córdoba (1577)]]

The area was inhabited by [[Indigenous people of the Americas|aboriginal people]] called [[Comechingones]], who lived in communities called ''[[ayllu]]s''. After four years, having repelled attacks by the aborigines, the settlement's authorities moved it to the opposite bank of the Suquía River in 1577. The Lieutenant Governor at the time, Don Lorenzo Suárez de Figueroa, planned the first layout of the city as a grid of 70 blocks. Once the city core had been moved to its current location, the population stabilized. The city's economy blossomed due to trade with the cities in the north.

In 1599, the religious order of the [[Jesuits]] arrived in the settlement. They established a [[Novitiate]] in 1608 and, in 1610, the Colegio Maximo, which became the University of Córdoba in 1613 (today [[National University of Córdoba]]), the fourth-oldest in the Americas. The local [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] church remains one of the oldest buildings in South America and contains the Monserrat Secondary School, a church, and residential buildings. To maintain such a project, the Jesuits operated five [[Jesuit Reductions|''Reducciones'']] in the surrounding fertile valleys, including Caroya, [[Jesús María, Córdoba|Jesús María]], Santa Catalina, [[Alta Gracia]] and Candelaria.

The farm and the complex (started in 1615, had to be vacated by the Jesuits following the 1767 decree by King [[Charles III of Spain]] that expelled the Jesuit order from the continent. [[Franciscan]]s then operated the Jesuits' foundations until 1853, when the Jesuits returned to the Americas. Nevertheless, the university and the high-school were nationalized a year later.
Each [[estancia]] has its own church and set of buildings, around which towns grew, such as [[Alta Gracia]], the closest to the Block.

===Early European settlement===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
[[File:Catedral de Córdoba a la tarde.JPG|thumb|Colonial [[Cathedral of Córdoba, Argentina|Cathedral of Córdoba]]]]

In 1776, [[King Carlos III]] created the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]], in which Córdoba stays in 1785 as the Government Intendency of Córdoba, including the current territories of the provinces of Córdoba, [[La Rioja Province (Argentina)|La Rioja]] and the region of [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]].

According to the 1760 census, the population of the city was 22,000 inhabitants. During the May Revolution in 1810, the widespread opinion of the most notable citizens was of continuing respecting the orders of [[Fernando VII]], attitude assumed by the local authorities, which led to the [[Liniers Counter-revolution]]. This position was not shared by the [[Dean Funes|Dean Gregorio Funes]], who was adhering to the revolutionary ideas, beside supporting contact with [[Manuel Belgrano]] and [[Juan José Castelli]].

In March 1816, the Argentine Congress met in [[Tucumán Province|Tucumán]] for an independence resolution. Córdoba sent [[Eduardo Pérez Bulnes]], Jerónimo Salguero de Cabrera, [[José Antonio Cabrera]], and to the Canon of the cathedral Michael Calixto of the Circle, all of them of autonomous position.

The 1820s belonged to [[caudillos]], since the country was in full process of formation. Until 1820 a central government taken root in Buenos Aires existed, but the remaining thirteen provinces felt that after 9 July 1816 what had happened it was simply a change of commander. The Battle of Cepeda pitted the commanders of the Littoral against the inland forces.

Finally, the Federales obtained the victory, for what the country remained since then integrated by 13 autonomous provinces, on the national government having been dissolved.
From this way the period known like about the Provincial Autonomies began. From this moment the provinces tried to create a [[Federal government|federal]] system that was integrating them without coming to good port, this mainly for the regional differences of every province.

Two Córdoba figures stood out in this period: Governor [[Juan Bautista Bustos]], who was an official of the Army of the North and in 1820 was supervised by the troops quartered in Arequito, a town near Córdoba, and his ally and later enemy, General [[José María Paz]]. In 1821, Bustos repelled the invasion of Córdoba on the part of Francisco Ramírez and his [[Chile]]an ally, General [[José Miguel Carrera]]. The conflict originated in a dispute with the power system that included the provinces of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], Córdoba and [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]]; according to the 1822 census the total population of Córdoba was of 11,552 inhabitants.

[[File:Arco de Córdoba 2007-11-16.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The Arch of cordoba.]]

At the end of the 19th century the process of national industrialization began with the height of the economic agro-exporting model, principally of meats and cereals. This process is associated with the [[Immigration to Argentina|European immigration]] who began to settle the city, generally possessing the education and enterprising capacity appropriate for the development of industry. The majority of these European immigrants came from Italy (initially from [[Piedmont]], [[Veneto]] and [[Lombardy]]; later from [[Campania]] and [[Calabria]]), and Spain (mostly [[Galicians]] and [[Basques]])

At the beginning of the 20th century the city had 90,000 inhabitants. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The city's physiognomy changed considerably following the construction of new avenues, walks and public squares, as well as the installation of an electrified tram system, in 1909. In 1918, Córdoba was the epicentre of a movement known as the [[University reform in Argentina|University Reform]], which then spread to the rest of the Universities of the country, Americas and [[Spain]]. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The development of the domestic market, the [[English settlement in Argentina|British investments]] that facilitated European settlement, the development of the railways on the [[pampas]] rapidly industrialized the city. Córdoba's industrial sector first developed from the need to transform [[raw materials]] such as leather, [[meats]] and [[wool]] for export.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cordoba.gov.ar/cordobaciudad/principal2/default.asp?ir=8_2 |title=Cordoba.gov: ciudad histórica Ciudad Historica |publisher=Cordoba.gov.ar |date=2005-03-11 |access-date=2014-04-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003125609/http://www.cordoba.gov.ar/cordobaciudad/principal2/default.asp?ir=8_2 |archive-date=3 October 2012 }}</ref>

In 1927, the Military Aircraft Manufacturer (FMA) was inaugurated. The facility would become one of the most important in the world after [[World War II]] with the arrival of German technical personnel. From 1952, its production began to diversify, to constitute the base of the former Institute Aerotécnico, the state-owned company Aeronautical and Mechanical Industries of the State (IAME). Córdoba was chosen as the site of The ''Instituto Aerotécnico'' that later became the ''Fábrica Militar de Aviones''. It employed the Focke Wulf men until President [[Juan Perón]] was ousted by a [[Revolución Libertadora|coup in 1955]]. [[Lockheed Martin]] purchased FMA in 1995.

Córdoba, according to the census of 1947, had almost 400,000 inhabitants (a quarter of the province's total). Subsequent industrial development led thousands of rural families to the city, doubling its population and turning Córdoba into the second largest city in Argentina, after Buenos Aires, by 1970. The city's population and economic growth moderated, afterwards, though living standards rose with the increase in the national consumption of Córdoba's industrial products, as well as the development of other sectors of economic activity. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

At times rivaling Buenos Aires for its importance in national politics, Córdoba was the site of the initial mutiny leading to the 1955 ''[[Revolución Libertadora]]'' that deposed President [[Juan Perón]] and the setting for the 1969 ''[[Cordobazo]]'', a series of violent labor and student protests that ultimately led to [[Argentine general election, March 1973|elections in 1973]]. Córdoba's current economic diversity is due to a vigorous services sector and the demand for agro-industrial and railway equipment and, in particular, the introduction of U.S. and European automakers after 1954.

== Geography ==
[[File:Location of Cordoba City Argentina.svg|thumb|Location of Córdoba.<br />1. [[Argentina]]<br />2. [[Córdoba Province (Argentina)|Córdoba Province]]<br />3. Córdoba City]]
The city's geographic location is {{Coord|31|25|S|64|11|W}}, taking as a point of reference San Martín Square in downtown Córdoba. The relative location of the municipal common land, is in the south hemisphere of the globe, to the south of the [[South American]] subcontinent, in the geographical centre – west of Argentina and of the province of Córdoba; to a distance of {{convert|702|km|0|abbr=on}} from [[Buenos Aires]], {{convert|401|km|0|abbr=on}} from the city of [[Rosario]] and (340&nbsp;km (211&nbsp;mi)) west of [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]].

As per the provincial laws No. 778 14 December 1878, Not. 927 20 October 1883, and Not. 1295 29 December 1893, the limits of the city of Córdoba are delineated in the northern part, South, East and West located to {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} from San Martín Square which means that the common land has {{convert|24|km|0|abbr=on}} from side. The city, adjoins in the northern territory with [[Colón Department, Córdoba|Colón Department]] summarizing a total surface of 562. <!--<ref name="OBSCAP07"/> see the other ref like this for explanation--->

===Geology===
The city is located in the plain of the [[Pampa|Humid Pampa]], to the east of the oriental cord of Córdoba Hills or Sierras Chicas, also known as the Sierras Cordobesas, which has an average height of 550 m.<ref>

</ref> It spreads at the foot of the mount, on both banks of the River Suquía, and flows into the [[San Roque Lake|San Roque reservoir]]; from there, the [[Primero River]] goes east into the plains surrounding the city of Córdoba.

Once inside the city, the ''La Cañada'' stream meets the [[Rio Primero]] near the city centre area. Two kilometers to the east, ''Isla de los Patos'' (Ducks Island) was repopulated with ducks and swans in the 1980s. It was reported in March 2006 that a large number of ducks had died due to unspecified causes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/EdicionImpresa/informaciongeneral/nota.asp?nota_id=792738 |title=lanacion.com.ar |publisher=lanacion.com.ar |date=2006-03-29 |access-date=2014-04-22}}</ref> Pollution caused by chemical waste is suspected as the cause, but [[avian influenza]] is also being investigated.

Beyond the city limits, the river flows towards the Algarrobos swamp and ends its course on the southern coast of the [[Mar Chiquita, Córdoba|Mar Chiquita]] (or Mar de Ansenuza) [[salt lake (geography)|salt lake]]. All in all, the river has a length of approximately {{convert|200|km|0|abbr=on}} and carries, on average, 9.7 m³/s, with minimum of 2 m³/s and maximum of 24 m³/s<ref>[http://www.ramsar.org/ris/ris_argentina_chiquita_s.htm Ramsar.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101060953/http://www.ramsar.org/ris/ris_argentina_chiquita_s.htm |date=1 November 2008 }}</ref> with a peak during the summer months.

[[Water pollution|Pollution of the water]] and of the riverbank is a major environmental issue in Córdoba. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Periodic cleaning operations are carried out to increase the quality of the water and to preserve the viability of fishing, both in the San Roque reservoir area and downstream.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

=== Climate ===
The climate of the city of Córdoba, and that of most of the province, is [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] (''Cwa'', according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]), moderated by the Pampas winds, cold winds that blow from the South-western quadrant, which originate in [[Antarctica]].

There are four marked seasons. Summers run from late November till early March, and bring days between {{convert|28|°C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|33|°C|0|abbr=on}} and night between {{convert|15|°C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|19|°C|0|abbr=on}} with frequent thunderstorms. Heat waves are common, and bring days with temperatures over {{convert|38|°C|0|abbr=on}} and hot, sticky nights; however, Pampero winds are sure to bring relief with thunderstorms and a day or two of cool, crisp weather: nighttime temperatures can easily descend to {{convert|12|°C|0|abbr=on}} or less, but the heat starts building up right away the next day.

By late February or early March, nights start getting cooler and, in March, highs average {{convert|27|°C|0|abbr=on}} and lows {{convert|15|°C|0|abbr=on}}; after cold fronts, lows below {{convert|10|°C|0|abbr=on}} and highs below {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}} are recorded in this month.
April is significantly drier already; highs reach {{convert|24|°C|0|abbr=on}} on average and lows {{convert|12|°C|0|abbr=on}}, creating very pleasant conditions. In some years, temperatures can approach or even reach the freezing point in late April; however, heat waves of up to {{convert|33|°C|0|abbr=on}} are still possible, but nights are rarely as hot as in the summer.
May usually brings the first frosts, and very dry weather, with under {{convert|20|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rain expected. Highs average {{convert|21|°C|0|abbr=on}} and lows average {{convert|8|°C|0|abbr=on}}; however, when cold waves reach the area, highs may stay below {{convert|8|°C|0|abbr=on}} and lows can be well below freezing.

Winter lasts from late May till early September, and bring average highs of {{convert|18|°C|0|abbr=on}} and lows of {{convert|4|°C|0|abbr=on}}. However, strong northwesterly winds downsloping from the mountains can bring what is known as "Veranito" (little summer) with highs of up to {{convert|30|°C|0|abbr=on}} or more and dusty, windy weather (but dry, pleasant nights) for 2–3 days. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Conversely, when storms stall over the Atlantic coast, there may be several days of drizzle and cool weather, and when cold air masses invade the country from Antarctica (several times every winter), there may be one or two days with temperatures around {{convert|6|°C|0|abbr=on}}, drizzle and high winds (which combined make it feel very cold), followed by dry, cold weather with nighttime lows between {{convert|0|°C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|-5|°C|0|abbr=on}} and daytime highs between {{convert|8|°C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|15|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Snowfall is very rare in the city, but more frequent in the outskirts where the Sierras begin {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}; sleet may fall every once in a while. The record low temperature for Córdoba is {{convert|-8.3|°C|1|abbr=on}}. In June, only {{convert|3.5|mm|1|abbr=on}} of rain are expected, compared to {{convert|168|mm|1|abbr=on}} in January.

Spring is extremely variable and windy: there may be long stretches of cool, dry weather and cold nights followed by intense heat waves up to {{convert|38|°C|0|abbr=on}}, followed by the most severe thunderstorms with hail and high winds. It is not unusual to see temperatures drop {{convert|20|C-change|0|abbr=on}} from one day to another, or to have frost following extreme heat. Drought is most common in this season, when the normal summer rainfall arrives later than expected.
By October, days are warm at {{convert|26|°C|0|abbr=on}} but nights remain cold at {{convert|11|°C|0|abbr=on}}, by late November, the weather resembles summer weather with cooler nights.

The wealthier suburbs west of the city are located at slightly higher altitudes, which allows cool breezes to blow in the summer, bringing drier, comfortable nights during hotter periods, and more regular frost in the winter. Generally speaking, Córdoba's daytime temperatures are very slightly warmer than Buenos Aires' but nighttime lows are usually cooler, especially in the winter. This, combined with a lower humidity and the possibility of fleeing to higher altitudes minutes away from the city centre, makes the climate a bit more comfortable than in the capital.

The variations or thermal extents are greater than in Buenos Aires, and lower in annual rainfall: {{convert|750|mm|0|abbr=on}} / year. The annual average temperature calculated during the 20th century was 18&nbsp;°C. In January, the hottest month of the austral summer, the average maximum is 31&nbsp;°C and the minimum 17&nbsp;°C.
In July, the coldest month of the year, the average temperatures are between 19&nbsp;°C and 3&nbsp;°C.
In winter it is very frequent that temperatures rise above 30&nbsp;°C, due to the influence of the wind Zonda.

Due to the extension of the [[metropolitan area]], there exists a difference of 5&nbsp;°C between the central area and the Greater Córdoba. The central district, a dense high-rise area is located in a depression, and it is the core of an important [[heat island]]. In addition the city presents a phenomenon of smog, but not so dense as to present health concerns.

=== Ethnicity ===
The largest ethnic groups in Córdoba are [[Italians]]/[[Italian Argentine]] and [[Spaniards]]/[[Spanish Argentine]] (mostly [[Galicians]] and [[Basques]]/[[Basque Argentine]]). Waves of immigrants from other European countries arrived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. From the rest of [[Western Europe]] came immigrants from [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Scandinavia]] (especially [[Sweden]]). Other Europeans also arrived from nations such as [[Croatia]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], [[Russia]], [[Romania]], [[Ukraine]], [[Armenia]] and the [[Balkans]] (especially [[Greece]], [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]). By the 1910s, 43 percent of the city population was non-native Argentine after immigration rates peaked.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://alhim.revues.org/document432.html |title=Dinámica migratoria: coyuntura y estructura en la Argentina de fines del XX |year=2004 |publisher=Alhim.revues.org |doi=10.4000/alhim.432 |access-date=2014-04-22|last1=Velázquez |first1=Guillermo Angel |last2=Lende |first2=Sebastián Gómez |journal=Amérique Latine Histoire et Mémoire |issue=9 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/hacienda/sis_estadistico/anu_estadistico/01/web01/c110.htm |title=Buenosaires.gov.ar |access-date=30 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929183555/http://www.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/hacienda/sis_estadistico/anu_estadistico/01/web01/c110.htm |archive-date=29 September 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Important [[Lebanese Argentine|Lebanese]], [[Georgians|Georgian]], [[Syrian Argentine|Syrian]] and [[Armenian Argentine|Armenian]] communities have had a significant presence in commerce and civic life since the beginning of the 20th century.

Most immigrants, regardless of origin, settled in the city or around [[conurbation|Greater Córdoba]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} However, in the early stages of immigration, some formed settlements (especially [[agricultural settlements in Argentina|agricultural settlements]]) in different parts of the city, often encouraged by the Argentine government and/or sponsored by private individuals and organizations. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

=== Demographic distribution ===
Córdoba is the second largest city in the country in population and concentrates 40.9% of the Córdoba Province population of 3,216,993 inhabitants and represents almost 3.3% of the [[Argentine]] population, which is 43000000 or 43 million inhabitants. Driven by migration both domestic and from abroad, the city's rate of population growth was an elevated 3.2% annually from 1914 to 1960; but, it has been declining steadily since then, and has averaged around 0.4% a year, since the national census of 2001.

According to the last provincial census of 2008, the city has 1,315,540 inhabitants, representing an increase of 3.78% with regard to the 1,267,521 registered during the national census of 2001.<ref name="censo 2008">

Greater Córdoba is the metropolitan area of the city of Córdoba, a union of medium localities of the department Colón, from the north to the south. Greater Córdoba is the second-largest urban agglomeration in Argentina in both population and surface area.

The growth of the metropolitan area was not equal in all directions, it spreads approximately up to {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the northwest of the Córdoba city centre in a thin succession of small localities. This is almost the maximum distance from the Buenos Aires city center to the most distant of its metropolitan area points; whereas in the rest of the cardinal points it comes to {{convert|15|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.

The city receives a constant flow of students from the northeastern and southwestern regions of Argentina and of other [[South American]] countries, owed principally to the National University of Córdoba, which increases gradually the city population. Córdoba grows constantly, expanding especially towards the southern areas of [[Alta Gracia]] and [[Villa Carlos Paz]].

The historical centre is shaped by quadrangular blocks of some hundred thirty meters of side. The disposition of the neighborhoods and principal avenues is radial. From the city centre district large avenues lead out to the most peripheral neighborhoods. In conformity with demographic growth, the city has expanded principally to the northwest and to the southeast, following the trace of the [[National Route 9 (Argentina)|National Route 9]].
 
The governor, Juan Schiaretti, finalized the Circunvalaciónon on 6 July 2019, with completing the building of the last 2,8&nbsp;km of the route from La Cañanada to Fuerza Aerea. This ended the construction of the 47&nbsp;km long ring road motorway, which takes almost 34 minutes to complete.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lavoz.com.ar/videos/circunvalacion-completa-rodear-ciudad-de-cordoba-demanda-34-minutos|title=Circunvalación completa: rodear la ciudad de Córdoba demanda 34 minutos|publisher=LaVoz|date=6 July 2019|language=es|access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref>

===Districts===
[[File:Parte_Frontal.jpg|thumb|The Cordoba Courthouse.]]
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Cordoba Skyline.jpg|thumb|center|800px|Panorama of the Nueva Córdoba Skyline.]] -->
Córdoba is home to one of the most important financial districts in South America. The district is home to the Bank of Córdoba and other private banking institutions. Sightseeing places include San Martín Square, the [[Jesuit Block and Estancias of Córdoba|Jesuit Block]] (declared UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]) and the Genaro Pérez Museum. The streets mostly follow a regular checkerboard pattern, and the main thoroughfares are Vélez Sarsfield, Colón, General Paz, Dean Funes Avenue, and 27 April Street. The point of origin of the city is San Martin Square, surrounded by the Municipality and Central Post Office.

Downtown Córdoba is home to large shopping malls, notably [[Patio Olmos]]. This mall is the result of a massive regeneration effort, recycling and refurbishing the west side old warehouses into elegant offices and commercial centres. An important cultural point of interest is the Palacio Ferreyra, a mansion built in 1916 based on plans by the [[French architecture|French architect]], [[Ernest Sanson]]. The Ferreyra palace was converted into the [[Evita Fine Arts Museum|Evita Perón Museum of Fine Arts]] (the city's second) in 2007. Located at the corner of Hipólito Yrigoyen and Chacabuco Avenues, it has now been restored and adapted to house the city's principal art gallery.

[[New Córdoba]] has a number of important avenues such as ''Yrigoyen'' and ''Vélez Sarsfield''. Most of the university students in this growing city live in this neighbourhood, and a recent construction boom has been transforming this upscale area into the fastest-growing section in the city.

[[File:Puente parque de las tejas.JPG|thumb|Tejas Park at New Córdoba.]]
Ciudad Universitaria is a district located in the southern area of the city, next to the {{convert|17|ha|acre|abbr=off}} [[Sarmiento Park]], the city's most important one. The [[Universidad Nacional de Córdoba]] (UNC) has most of its facilities in this area. The UNC was the first university built in [[Argentina]], founded by Jesuits around 1622. The [[Universidad Nacional de Córdoba]] is also famous for the "Reforma Universitaria", a student-led protest that started in March 1918 in the Medical School, in which the students rebelled against the prevailing university system. This was an old anachronistic system in which professors were authoritarian and inefficient, with a religiously-oriented curriculum. Eventually this revolt led to a more secular curriculum and some significant re-structuring of the university government. The distinctive nature of the movement derived not only from its radical demands, but also from its extremist tactics, the level of sophistication of its organization, and its major continental impact. In fact, the Reform Movement rapidly spread from Córdoba to [[Lima]] (1919), Cuzco (1920), Santiago de Chile (1920), and Mexico (1921). Another important university, the [[National Technological University|UTN]], dedicated to the teaching of engineering sciences, is located in this part of the city. There is also a gym and football stadium and tennis courts for the students. The ''Córdoba Zoo'' is located in this district.

Located about {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} from downtown Córdoba is the Cerro de Las Rosas. This very affluent neighborhood is famous for its schools, shops and educational institutions. This neighborhood's economic activity centers around Rafael Núñez Avenue, a long wide road that stretches for a few kilometers and has restaurants, boutiques, banks and other shops. Over the last decade, this neighborhood has experienced steady growth; however, some of its most affluent inhabitants have moved to gated communities for security reasons. Some of these communities, such as "Las Delicias" and "Lomas de los Carolinos", are in the old Camino a La Calera.

== Transportation ==
The Córdoba public transport system includes [[rail transport|trains]], [[bus]]es, [[trolleybus]]es and [[taxi]]s. Long-distance buses reach most cities and towns throughout the country.

The city is served by the nation's third-largest airport, [[Ingeniero Ambrosio L.V. Taravella International Airport]].

=== Buses ===
Buses are, by far, the most popular way of transportation around Córdoba Province. There are many different companies that provide long distance, short distance and urban services. They all have their own prices, that are not cheap compared to the rest of Argentina. Córdoba is one of the Provinces with higher transportation rates. Urban buses used to be paid with a card called [https://www.red-bus.com.ar/ RedBus]

That station has been an intermediate stop for trains to [[Tucumán Mitre railway station|Tucumán]], successively operated by [[Ferrocarriles Argentinos]] and then by [[privately held company|private]] consortiums such as [[Ferrocentral]]. The other station is [[Alta Córdoba railway station|Alta Córdoba]], built and operated by [[Great Britain|British]]-owned [[Córdoba North Western Railway|Córdoba North Western]] in 1891, and currently the terminus of Tren de las Sierras.

Since World War II, Córdoba has been developing a versatile industrial base. The biggest sectors is car and car parts manufacturing: [[Renault]] has a factory which produces a range of cars and [[Volkswagen]] has a factory specialized in the production of gearboxes. The capital goods company [[CNH Industrial]] has also a factory in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnhindustrial.com/en-us/media/press_releases/2018/december/Pages/The-CNH-Industrial-site-in-Córdoba,-Argentina,-achieves-Bronze-Level-designation-in-World-Class-Manufacturing.aspx|title=The CNH Industrial Site in Córdoba, Argentina, Achieves Bronze Level Designation in World Class Manufacturing|publisher=CNH Industrial|date=7 December 2018|location=London|access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref> The legal service [[Novadios]] was founded in 2008 in this city. Many suppliers (both local and foreign) manufacture car parts for these operations. Additionally, in 2017–2018, [[Nissan]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]] began the production of their new pickup truck at the local [[Renault]] factory. Railway construction ([[Materfer]]) and aircraft construction ([[Fábrica Militar de Aviones]]) were once significant employers, but their activities have greatly diminished. Furthermore, there are some textile, heavy and chemical industries (e.g. [[Porta Hermanos S.A.|Porta]] for alcohol).
[[File:Cordoba Patio Olmos.JPG|thumb|130px|The Patio Olmos Shopping Gallery.]]
Areas around Córdoba produce vast amounts of agricultural products, and some of these are processed around the city. Additionally, the province is one of the main producers of agricultural machinery in the country, although most of these operations are not in the city itself. Candy company [[Grupo Arcor|Arcor]] is headquartered in the city.

Córdoba has been considered the technological centre of [[Argentina]]. The Argentine ''spaceport'' (Centro Espacial Teófilo Tabanera), where [[satellite]]s are being developed and operated for [[Comisión Nacional de Actividades Espaciales|CONAE]], is located in the suburb of Falda del Carmen. The software and electronic industries are advancing and becoming significant exporters; among the leading local employers in the sector are [[Motorola]], Vates, [[Intel]], [[Electronic Data Systems]], and Santex América.

The city also has a service-based economy focused on retail, professional services and financial services, where the main local player is credit card provider Tarjeta Naranja. It has recently emerged as a start-up hub with a growing number of angel investors, in part due to the availability of people with technology-oriented skills.

==Sports==
[[Association football]] is the most popular sport in Córdoba as well as in Argentina. Several leagues and divisions compete in the local championship annually. The city currently has three representatives in the [[Argentine First Division]], [[Talleres de Córdoba|Talleres]], [[Club Atlético Belgrano|Belgrano]], and [[Instituto Atlético Central Córdoba|Instituto]], and also one in the [[Argentine Second Division|second]], [[Club Atlético Racing de Córdoba|Racing de Córdoba]]. [[Estadio Mario Alberto Kempes]] hosted 8 matches in the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]].

Basketball is the second-most popular sport in Córdoba. [[Asociación Deportiva Atenas]] is the most popular club, and one of the most successful in Argentina, having won the National League (LNB) seven times, and being three times winner of the South American League. Córdoba was one of the host cities of the official [[Basketball World Cup]] for its [[1967 Basketball World Cup|1967]] and [[1990 FIBA World Championship|1990]] editions.<ref>[https://archive.fiba.com/pages/eng/fa/event/p/sid/2912/_/index.html 1990 World Championship for Men], Archive.FIBA.com, Retrieved 18 March 2016.</ref>

Cordoba was also a host for the [[2002 FIVB Men's Volleyball World Championship]] and organized the [[UCI BMX World Championships]] in 2000.

[[Rugby union]] is also a very popular sport in Córdoba, which has close to 20 teams with many divisions. [[Tala Rugby Club]], [[Club La Tablada]], [[Córdoba Athletic Club]] (one of the oldest clubs in Argentina and founded by the British who worked in the building of the Argentine Railroads around 1882), [[Jockey Club Córdoba]], and [[Club Universitario de Córdoba]] are some of the most prestigious teams. Córdoba is one of the strongest rugby places in Argentina, and is the home of many international players. Many of the great players in Argentina and Italy began their careers in the Córdoba's rugby clubs.

In tennis, since 2019, the [[Córdoba Open]] is also held at the "[[Estadio Mario Alberto Kempes|Polo Deportivo Kempes]]", a sports complex next to [[Estadio Mario Alberto Kempes]].
Golf and tennis are also very popular; notable players who started playing in Córdoba include [[Ángel Cabrera|Ángel "Pato" Cabrera]] and [[Eduardo Romero|Eduardo "Gato" Romero]] (b. 1954) in golf and [[David Nalbandian]] in tennis.

==Culture==
===Literature===
Literary activity flourished in the city at the beginning of the last century. Córdoba was the city of [[Leopoldo Lugones]], Arturo Capdevila and Marcos Aguinis, among many other prestigious writers. Among the city's best-known museums are the [[Caraffa Fine Arts Museum]], founded in 1916, and the [[Evita Fine Arts Museum]], founded in 2007. The [[Paseo del Buen Pastor]], a cultural center opened in 2007, features an art museum, as well as a shopping gallery devoted to local vintners, cheese makers, leather crafters and other artisans.

===Music===
The typical music in Córdoba is the ''[[cuarteto]]'', heard in many parties and pubs. Among the most popular cuarteto singers are [[La Mona Jiménez|Carlos ''La Mona'' Jiménez]] (b. 1951), [[Rodrigo (musician)|Rodrigo]], La Barra and Jean Carlos. The places they usually sing are named ''bailes'' (dances). One of the first groups was ''Cuarteto de Oro''.

Other music styles popular with the youth are [[electronic music]] (or ''electro''), as well as [[reggaeton]]. These are commonly played at ''boliches'', as night clubs are known in Argentina. Córdoba is sometimes referred to as "the nightlife city" (or "the city that never sleeps"), because of its wide range of clubs and teenage ''matinées'' (dancing clubs).

Córdoba's rich musical culture also encompasses [[Classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], rock and pop, in a variety of venues.

[[Libertador Theatre|Teatro Libertador San Martín]] regularly features concerts, operas, folk music, and plays.

===Monuments===
[[File:Iglesia de los Capuchinos Cordoba Argentina.jpg|thumb|Los Capuchinos Church]]

Córdoba has many historical monuments left over from the colonial era. In the centre, near the ''[[Plaza San Martín, Córdoba|Plaza San Martín]]'' square, is the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Córdoba Cathedral|Cathedral]], whose altar is made of stone and silver from [[Potosí]]. Every ornament inside is made of gold and the roof is all painted with different images from the Bible. Another important historic building is the ''[[Córdoba Cabildo|Cabildo]]'' (colonial government house), located next to the church. The Jesuit Block, the Monserrat School, the University and the church of the Society of Jesus are also located in Córdoba.

In Nueva Córdoba, it is situated "Iglesia del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús", also known as "Los Cappuchinos". This is an example of Neo Gothic style.

===Festivals===
The first festival of the year is in February, the Carnival, where children enjoy throwing water balloons at each other on the street.

Then in the middle of the year, on 20 July, Friends Day is celebrated. Usually, most of the teenagers meet at Parque de las Naciones or Parque Sarmiento and spend the afternoon there. At night, they go dancing to different places, and enjoy a drink.

The last festival is Spring Day, held on 21 September, which is Students' Day. Many go to the park or spend the day in the nearby city of [[Villa Carlos Paz]]. There they can enjoy concerts, dancing, going downtown or visiting the river bank.
