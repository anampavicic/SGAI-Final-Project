Dhaka is also the largest [[Bengali language|Bengali-speaking]] city in the world.

The area of Dhaka has been inhabited since the first millennium. An [[early modern period|early modern]] city developed from the 17th century as a provincial capital and commercial centre of the [[Mughal Empire]]. Dhaka was the capital of a [[proto-industrialization|proto-industrialized]] [[Mughal Bengal]] for 75 years (1608–39 and 1660–1704).

The pre-colonial city's glory peaked in the 17th and 18th centuries, when it was home to merchants from across [[Eurasia]].

The latter was also the seat of [[Isa Khan]] and his son [[Musa Khan of Bengal|Musa Khan]], who both headed a confederation of twelve chieftains that resisted Mughal expansion in eastern Bengal during the late 16th century. Due to a change in the course of the Ganges, the strategic importance of Gour was lost. Dhaka was viewed with strategic importance due to the Mughal need to consolidate control in eastern Bengal. The Mughals also planned to extend their empire beyond into [[Assam]] and [[Arakan]]. Dhaka and Chittagong became the eastern frontiers of the Mughal Empire.

Dhaka became the capital of the Mughal province of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa in 1610 with a jurisdiction covering modern-day Bangladesh and [[east India|eastern India]], including the modern-day [[Indian state]]s of [[West Bengal]], [[Bihar]] and [[Orissa]]. This province was known as [[Bengal Subah]]. The city was founded during the reign of [[Jahangir|Emperor Jahangir]].

The prosperity of Dhaka reached its peak during the administration of governor [[Shaista Khan]] (1644-1677 and 1680–1688). Rice was then sold at eight maunds per rupee. Thomas Bowrey, an English merchant sailor who visited the city between 1669 and 1670, wrote that the city was 40 miles in circuit. He estimated the city to be more populated than [[London]] with 900,000 people.<ref>Historical Background for the Establishment of Naib-Nazimship (Deputy Governorship for the four Divisions of Subah Bangla), ''Asiatic Society of Bangladesh''</ref>

Bengal became the economic engine of the Mughal Empire. Dhaka played a key role in the [[proto-industrialisation|proto-industrialization]] of Bengal. It was the centre of the [[muslin trade in Bengal]], leading to muslin being called "daka" in distant markets as far away as [[Central Asia]].<ref>Richard Maxwell Eaton (1996), The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier, 1204-1760, page 202, University of California Press</ref> Mughal India depended on Bengali products like rice, silk and cotton textiles.

The construction of [[Lalbagh Fort]] was commenced in 1678 by [[Muhammad Azam Shah|Prince Azam Shah]], who was the governor of Bengal, a son of [[Emperor Aurangzeb]] and a future [[Mughal Emperor]] himself. The Lalbagh Fort was intended to be the viceregal residence of Mughal governors in eastern India. Before the fort's construction could be completed, the prince was recalled by Emperor Aurangzeb. The fort's construction was halted by Shaista Khan after the death of his daughter [[Pari Bibi]], who is buried in a tomb in the centre of the unfinished fort. Pari Bibi, whose name means ''Fairy Lady'', was legendary for her beauty, engaged to Prince Azam Shah, and a potential future Mughal empress before her premature death.<ref>{{cite news |title=Legends of Lalbagh |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/star-weekend/heritage/legends-lalbagh-95554 |work=The Daily Star |date=12 June 2015 |access-date=24 October 2022 |archive-date=24 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221024144002/https://www.thedailystar.net/star-weekend/heritage/legends-lalbagh-95554 |url-status=live }}</ref> Internal conflict in the Mughal court cut short Dhaka's growth as an imperial city. Prince Azam Shah's rivalry with [[Murshid Quli Khan]] resulted in Dhaka losing its status as the provincial capital. In 1717, the provincial capital was shifted to [[Murshidabad]] where Murshid Quli Khan declared himself as the [[Nawab of Bengal]].

===Naib Nizamat===
[[File:Court of the Naib Nazim of Dhaka.jpg|thumb|Court of the [[Naib Nazim of Dhaka]], the governor of Dhaka, Chittagong and Comilla under the Nawabs of Bengal]]
Under the Nawabs of Bengal, the [[Naib Nazim of Dhaka]] was in charge of the city. The Naib Nazim was the deputy governor of Bengal. He also dealt with the upkeep of the Mughal Navy. The Naib Nazim was in charge of the Dhaka Division, which included Dhaka, [[Comilla]], and Chittagong. Dhaka Division was one of the four divisions under the Nawabs of Bengal. The Nawabs of Bengal allowed European trading companies to establish factories across Bengal. The region then became a hotbed for European rivalries. The British moved to oust the last independent Nawab of Bengal in 1757, who was allied with the French. Due to the defection of Nawab's army chief [[Mir Jafar]] to the British side, the last Nawab lost the [[Battle of Plassey]].{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}

After the [[Battle of Buxar]] in 1765, the [[Treaty of Allahabad]] allowed the British East India Company to become the tax collector in Bengal on behalf of the Mughal Emperor in Delhi. The Naib Nazim continued to function until 1793 when all his powers were transferred to the East India Company. The city formally passed to the control of the East India Company in 1793.

But the British neglected Dhaka's industrial and urban development until the late 19th century. Income from the pre-colonial, proto-industrialized textile industry dried up. Bengali weavers went out of business after the imposition of a 75% tax on the export of cotton from Bengal,<ref>Taylor, James (1840). A Sketch of the Topography and Statistics of Dacca. Calcutta: G.H. Huttmann, Military Orphan Press. pp. 301–307.</ref> as well as the surge in imports of cheap, British-manufactured fabrics after the advent of the spinning mule and steam power.{{citation needed|date=May 2024}} The rapid growth of the colonial capital [[Calcutta]] contributed to the decline in Dhaka's population and economy in the early 1800s.

This period is described as being "the colonial-era part of Dhaka, developed by the British during the early 20th century. Similar to colonial boroughs the length and breadth of the Subcontinent, this development was typified by stately government buildings, spacious tree-lined avenues, and sturdy white-washed bungalows set amidst always overgrown (the British never did manage to fully tame the landscape) gardens. Once upon a time, this was the new city; and even though it is today far from the ritziest part of town, the streets here are still wider and the trees more abundant and the greenery more evident than in any other part".<ref name="himalmag1"/>

Some of the early educational institutions established during the period of British rule include the [[Dhaka College]], the [[Sir Salimullah Medical College|Dhaka Medical School]], the [[Eden Mohila College|Eden College]], [[St Gregory's High School|St. Gregory's School]], the Mohsinia Madrasa, [[Jagannath University|Jagannath College]] and the [[Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology|Ahsanullah School of Engineering]].

The Nawabs of Dhaka owned [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]]s. [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] cars were widely used. [[Beauty Boarding]] was a popular inn and restaurant.

Dhaka's fortunes changed in the early 20th century. British neglect of Dhaka's urban development was overturned with the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|first partition of Bengal]] in 1905, which restored Dhaka's status as a regional capital. The city became the seat of government for [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]], with a jurisdiction covering most of modern-day Bangladesh and all of what is now [[Northeast India]]. The partition was the brainchild of [[Lord Curzon]], who finally acted on British ideas for partitioning Bengal to improve administration, education, and business. Dhaka became the seat of the [[Eastern Bengal and Assam Legislative Council]]. While Dhaka was the main capital throughout the year, [[Shillong]] acted as the summer retreat of the administration. Lieutenant Governors were in charge of the province. They resided in Dhaka. The Lt Governors included Sir [[Bampfylde Fuller]] (1905-1906), Sir Lancelot Hare (1906-1911), and [[Charles Stuart Bayley|Sir Charles Stuart Bayley]] (1911-1912).

On the political front, partition allowed Dhaka to project itself as the standard-bearer of Muslim communities in [[British Raj|British India]]; as opposed to the heavily Hindu-dominated city of Calcutta.<ref name="worldviewcities.org"/> In 1906, the [[All India Muslim League]] was founded in the city during a conference on liberal education hosted by the [[Khwaja Salimullah|Nawab of Dhaka]] and the [[Aga Khan III]]. The Muslim population in Dhaka and eastern Bengal generally favoured partition in the hopes of getting better jobs and educational opportunities. Many Bengalis, however, opposed the bifurcation of the ethnolinguistic region. The partition was annulled by an announcement from King [[George V]] during the [[Delhi Durbar]] in 1911. The British decided to reunite Bengal while the [[capital of India]] was shifted to [[New Delhi]] from Calcutta.

In 1969, [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] was released from prison amid a mass upsurge which led to the resignation of Ayub Khan in 1970. The city had an influential press with prominent newspapers like the ''[[The Bangladesh Observer|Pakistan Observer]]'', ''[[The Daily Ittefaq|Ittefaq]],'' ''[[Forum (Bangladesh)|Forum]]'', and the ''[[Weekly Holiday]]''. During the political and constitutional crisis in 1971, the [[military junta]] led by [[Yahya Khan]] refused to transfer power to the newly elected National Assembly, causing mass riots, civil disobedience, and a movement for [[self-determination]]. On 7 March 1971, [[Awami League]] leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman addressed a massive public gathering at the [[Suhrawardy Udyan|Ramna Race Course Maidan]] in Dhaka, in which he warned of an independence struggle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualbangladesh.com/culture/people-of-bangladesh/sheikh-mujibur-rahman/ |title=Sheikh Mujibur Rahman |publisher=Virtual Bangladesh |access-date=18 February 2015 |archive-date=16 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216193211/http://www.virtualbangladesh.com/culture/people-of-bangladesh/sheikh-mujibur-rahman/ |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Richards2003">{{Cite journal |last=Richards |first=John |date=July–September 2003 |title=Calcutta and Dhaka: A Tale of Two Cities |url=http://www.cdrb.org/journal/2003/3/3.pdf |journal=Asian Affairs |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=49–57 |access-date=1 March 2015 |archive-date=16 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216201250/http://www.cdrb.org/journal/2003/3/3.pdf |url-status=dead}}</ref> Subsequently, East Pakistan came under a [[Non-cooperation movement (1971)|non-co-operation]] movement against the Pakistani state.

After independence, Dhaka's population grew from several hundred thousand to several million in five decades. Dhaka was declared the national capital by the [[Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh]] in 1972. The post-independence period witnessed rapid growth as Dhaka attracted migrant workers from across rural [[Bangladesh]]. 60% of population growth has been due to rural migration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/dhaka-population/ |title=Dhaka Population 2020 |access-date=30 January 2017 |archive-date=31 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731001426/http://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/dhaka-population/ |url-status=live}}</ref> The city endured [[socialist]] unrest in the early 1970s, followed by a few years of [[martial law]].

Dhaka is located in central Bangladesh at {{Coord|23|42|N|90|22|E|type:city_region:BD|display=inline}}, on the eastern banks of the [[Buriganga River]]. The city lies on the lower reaches of the [[Ganges Delta]] and covers a total area of {{convert|270|km2|sqmi}}.  Tropical vegetation and moist soils characterize the land, which is flat and close to sea level. This leaves Dhaka susceptible to flooding during the [[monsoon]] seasons owing to heavy rainfall and [[cyclone]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hough |first=Michael |title=Cities and natural process |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |pages=64–65 |isbn=0-415-29855-5}}</ref> Due to its location on the lowland plain of the Ganges Delta, the city is fringed by extensive mangroves and tidal flat ecosystems.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Murray |first1=N.J. |last2=Clemens |first2=R.S. |last3=Phinn |first3=S.R. |last4=Possingham |first4=H.P. |last5=Fuller |first5=R.A. |title=Tracking the rapid loss of tidal wetlands in the Yellow Sea |journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment |date=2014 |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=267–272 |doi=10.1890/130260 |bibcode=2014FrEE...12..267M |url=https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/60169/1/130260.pdf |access-date=11 August 2021 |archive-date=7 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211207073933/https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/60169/1/130260.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> Dhaka District is bounded by the districts of [[Gazipur District|Gazipur]], [[Tangail District|Tangail]], [[Munshiganj District|Munshiganj]], [[Rajbari District|Rajbari]], [[Narayanganj District|Narayanganj]], and [[Manikganj District|Manikganj]].

Except [[Old Dhaka]], which is an old [[bazaar]]-style neighbourhood, the layout of the city follows a grid pattern with organic development influenced by traditional South Asian as well as Middle Eastern and Western patterns.

Dhaka does not have a well-defined [[central business district]]. [[Old Dhaka]] is the historic commercial centre, but most development has moved to the north. In 1985, the area around [[Motijheel Thana|Motijheel]] was considered the "modern" CBD, while by 2005 [[Gulshan Thana|Gulshan]] was considered the "newest" part of the CBD. Many Bangladeshi government institutions can be found in Motijheel, [[Segunbagicha]], [[Tejgaon Thana|Tejgaon]], [[Karwan Bazar]], and [[Sher-e-Bangla Nagar]].<ref name="Siddiqui2010">{{cite book |last1=Siddiqui |first1=K. |last2=Ahmed |first2=J. |last3=Siddique |first3=K. |last4=Huq |first4=S. |last5=Hossain |first5=A. |last6=Nazimud-Doula |first6=S. |last7=Rezawana |first7=N. |title=Social Formation in Dhaka, 1985-2005: A Longitudinal Study of Society in a Third World Megacity |publisher=Routledge |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-317-05400-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xqTeCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT32 |access-date=3 February 2022 |pages=6, 12}}</ref>

[[Water pollution]] is caused by the discharge of municipal wastewater from households and industry without treatment. As of 2011 only 20% of the city is connected to a [[Sewerage|sewer system]], whereas 80% is not connected.<ref name=":1" /> As a result, the rivers in Dhaka have severe [[pathogen]] pollution, as indicated by the [[fecal coliform]] count that is several hundred times higher than the recommended national and international standards of less than 200 [[Colony-forming unit|cfu]] per litre for bathing and swimming.<ref name=":2" /> Chemical surveys in the rivers near Dhaka show extremely high organic pollution loading, high [[Ammonia pollution|ammonia]], and very low [[dissolved oxygen]] levels, which are close to zero in the dry season.<ref name=":02" />

In addition to the organic and pathogen pollution load from the 1.2 million m<sup>3</sup> of untreated sewage, the rivers receive about 60,000 m<sup>3</sup> of industrial effluent every day from nine major industrial clusters (as of 2021).<ref name=":2" /> There are an estimated 500–700 wet processing and [[dyeing]] [[Textile factory|textile factories]] releasing a range of chemicals including salts, dyes and bleaches, and 155 [[tanneries]] discharging [[heavy metals]], including [[chromium]].<ref name=":2" />

Four of the rivers surrounding Dhaka—Buriganaga, Sitalakhya, Balu and Turag—are so polluted that they have been declared as ''ecologically critical areas'' in 2009 by the Department of Environment. This makes them unsuitable for any human use.<ref name=":2" /> Nevertheless, people living in low-income and slum areas still have a lot of direct contact with river water, exposing them to health risks. They use river water for dish washing, laundry, cleaning fish and vegetables, and personal washing, washing and dyeing [[denim]], washing fish baskets or plastic sheets, collecting plastic waste and fishing.<ref name=":2" /> As a result, many of the immediate environmental burdens of river pollution are borne by these low-income residents.<ref name=":2" />

Water bodies and [[wetland]]s around Dhaka are facing destruction as these are being filled up to construct multi-storied buildings and other real estate developments. Coupled with pollution, such erosion of natural habitats threatens to destroy much of the regional biodiversity.<ref name="Geo2" />

===Civic administration===
[[File:DG 81 - 09 NAGAR BHABAN ANCIENT DHAKA IMG 1655.jpg|thumb|[[Nagar Bhaban]] is the seat of the [[Dhaka South City Corporation]]]]

====History====
The municipality of Dhaka was founded on 1 August 1864 and upgraded to "[[municipal corporation|Metropolitan]]" status in 1978. In 1983, the [[Dhaka City Corporation]] was created as a self-governing entity to govern Dhaka.<ref name=star052015>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/star-weekend/heritage/reminiscing-dhakas-legacy-80994 |title=Reminiscing Dhaka's Legacy |work=The Daily Star |date=8 May 2015 |author=Md Shahnawaz Khan Chandan |access-date=22 June 2017 |archive-date=1 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201030749/http://www.thedailystar.net/star-weekend/heritage/reminiscing-dhakas-legacy-80994 |url-status=live}}</ref>

====Municipal government====
In 2011, Dhaka City Corporation was split into two separate corporations – [[Dhaka North City Corporation]] and [[Dhaka South City Corporation]] to ensure better civic facilities.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=206982 |title=Dhaka set to split into two |work=The Daily Star |date=18 October 2011 |access-date=12 February 2015 |author=Hasan Jahid Tusher |archive-date=13 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213005705/http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=206982 |url-status=live}}</ref> These two corporations are headed by two mayors, who are elected by direct vote of the citizen for 5 years. The area within city corporations was divided into several wards, each having an elected commissioner. In total, the city has 130 wards and 725 ''[[mohalla]]s''.

===Administrative agencies===
Unlike other megacities worldwide, Dhaka is serviced by over two dozen government organizations under different ministries. Lack of coordination among them and centralization of all powers by the Government of Bangladesh keeps the development and maintenance of the city in a chaotic situation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/what-should-we-do-better-civic-services-205963|title=What should we do for better civic services|work=The Daily Star|date=23 January 2016|access-date=18 June 2016|archive-date=30 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630121655/http://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/what-should-we-do-better-civic-services-205963|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Slums ====
{{See also|Squatting in Bangladesh}}
[[File:Karail03.jpg|thumb|The Karail slum in [[Mohakhali]]]]
About 30% of Dhaka's population lives in [[slum]]s (or unplanned urban settlements), as of 2016.<ref name=":1" /> Estimates from 2011 and 2015 found that there are about "3 to 5 thousand slums and squatter settlements scattered all over the city".<ref name=":1" /> It is often the new arrivals, people [[Rural-urban migration|migrating from rural areas]], who end up living in slums. People only have very limited access to water, [[sanitation]] and other services in those slum areas.

Slums may be found in the outskirts and in less-visible areas such as alleyways.<ref name="Gruebner Sachs Nockert Frings pp. 1–7">{{cite journal |last1=Gruebner |first1=Oliver |last2=Sachs |first2=Jonathan |last3=Nockert |first3=Anika |last4=Frings |first4=Michael |last5=Khan |first5=Md.

===Ethnicity===
The city population is composed of people from virtually every region of Bangladesh. The long-standing inhabitants of the old city are known as Dhakaite and have a distinctive Bengali dialect and culture. Dhaka is also home to a large number of Bihari refugees, who are descendants of migrant [[Muslims]] from eastern India during 1947 and settled down in East Pakistan. The correct population of [[Biharis]] living in the city is ambiguous, but it is estimated that there are at least 300,000 Urdu-speakers in all of Bangladesh, mostly residing in old Dhaka and in refugee camps in Dhaka, although official figures estimate only 40,000.<ref name=fe>{{cite news |title=Govt ready to offer nationality to Urdu-speaking people: Moni |url=http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/more.php?news_id=110539 |access-date=12 April 2011 |newspaper=The Financial Express |location=Dhaka |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104171314/http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/more.php?news_id=110539 |archive-date=4 November 2011}}</ref><ref name=dw>{{cite web |title=Socio-economic Problems of the Urdu Speaking Residents at Mohammadpur |url=http://www.dwatch-bd.org/ggtp/Research%20Reports/research3.pdf |publisher=Democracy Watch |access-date=12 April 2011 |archive-date=12 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612081936/http://www.dwatch-bd.org/ggtp/Research%20Reports/research3.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=ju>{{cite web |author=Tasmia Persoob |title=The Forgotten Community: Camp Based Urdu Speaking People in Bangladesh |url=http://akira-foundation.org/Documents/fellow%20product%20%28Tasmia%29.pdf |publisher=Jahangirnagar University |access-date=12 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322152732/http://akira-foundation.org/Documents/fellow%20product%20%28Tasmia%29.pdf |archive-date=22 March 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Between 15,000 and 20,000 of the [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]], [[Santals|Santal]], [[Khasi people|Khasi]], [[Garo (tribe)|Garo]], [[Chakma people|Chakma]] and [[Mandi State|Mandi]] tribal peoples reside in the city.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/suppliments/2006/15thanniv/ourcities/ourcities06.htm |title=::Our Cities::15th Anniversary Special |work=The Daily Star |access-date=8 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302043551/http://www.thedailystar.net/suppliments/2006/15thanniv/ourcities/ourcities06.htm |archive-date=2 March 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[Water management in Dhaka]] faces numerous challenges such as [[flood]]ing, poor service quality, [[Overdrafting|groundwater depletion]], inadequate [[sanitation]], [[Water pollution|polluted river water]], unplanned urban development, and the existence of large [[slum]]s.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book |last=Khan |first=Taqsem |url=https://www.globalwaterintel.com/client_media/uploaded/Conference%20book%202011_Focusing_on_performance_72%20pixels%20per%20inch.pdf |title=Focusing on performance: Global water summit 2011 |publisher=Global Water Intelligence |year=2011 |location=Berlin |pages=50–52 |chapter=The performance challenges of Dhaka WASA}}</ref> 

The [[Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority]] (Dhaka WASA) is "responsible for providing drinking water, sewerage, and stormwater drainage services to the city".<ref name=":1" /> The work of Dhaka WASA is funded by the [[Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Co-operatives|Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development, and Cooperatives]]. 

87% of the city's growing water demand is sourced from [[groundwater]] (as of 2021). This is because the extreme contamination of rivers and lakes makes surface water treatment economically and technologically unfeasible.<ref name=":2" /> While around 20% of the daily demand of 2.4 billion litres of water is met with surface water from five [[Treatment plant|treatment plants]],<ref name=":7">{{Cite web |last=Islam |first=Jahidul |date=2020-03-02 |title=Dhaka Wasa looks to more groundwater extraction |url=https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/dhaka-wasa-looks-more-groundwater-extraction-50872 |access-date=2024-07-02 |website=[[The Business Standard]] |language=en}}</ref> the groundwater table is falling at a rate of two to three metres per year.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":7" />

The Bangladesh Urban Informal Settlements Survey 2016 included a representative sample of 588 households across small, medium and large [[Slum|slums]] in Dhaka. It showed that 68% of the households accessed [[piped water]] through a shared connection within the slum compound. The poorest households shared a waterpoint with 43 other households on average compared to 23 sharers among the richest households. In terms of [[sanitation]], only 8% of the slum households had access to a [[flush toilet]] connected to a [[septic tank]], while 78% used improved [[pit latrine]]s and the remaining 10% depended on hanging latrines.<ref name=":2" />

=== Sewage treatment plants ===
The [[Sewerage|sewage system]] is inadequate, with 70 per cent of the two million cubic metres of [[sewage]] produced daily being discharged into rivers, according to wastewater management experts.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web |last=Mithu |first=Ariful Islam |date=2019-10-07 |title=Dhaka's outdated sewage system choking rivers |url=https://www.tbsnews.net/environment/dhakas-outdated-sewage-system-choking-rivers |access-date=2024-07-02 |website=[[The Business Standard]] |language=en}}</ref> Due to improper maintenance and the age of the system, the majority of the sewerage network is out of operation.<ref name="s372">{{cite web |last=Hasan |first=Jubair |date=8 July 2018 |title=Dhaka city exists with no effective sewerage system |url=https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/trade/dhaka-city-exists-with-no-effective-sewerage-system-1531022465 |access-date=2 July 2024 |website=[[The Financial Express (Bangladesh)|The Financial Express]]}}</ref><ref name="o611">{{cite web |last=Mamun |first=Shohel |date=8 October 2022 |title=Lack of drainage network hampers Dasherkandi sewage treatment plant |url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/dhaka/277874/lack-of-drainage-network-hampers-dasherkandi |access-date=2 July 2024 |website=[[Dhaka Tribune]]}}</ref> Most buildings handle their own sewage by constructing [[Soak pit|soak pits]] or [[Septic tank|septic tanks]], often connected to [[Storm drain|storm drains]].

The [[Government of Bangladesh|Bangladesh Government]] and the Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA) are implementing an ambitious plan, called ''Dhaka Sewerage Master Plan'', to treat most of the residential and industrial wastewater through the construction of several sewage treatment plants. The Bangladesh Government is planning to install over 12 large new sewage treatment plants over the next 20 years.<ref name=":02" />

===Textiles===
[[File:Dhaka Sari Fabric 1.jpg|thumb|Indigenous [[sari]] fabrics, including [[Jamdani]], at a store in Dhaka]]
For centuries, the region around Dhaka has been the center of production for fine cotton textiles. [[Muslin]] was abundantly produced in the region. The weavers of Dhaka were patronized by the rulers of Bengal and Delhi. They supplied textiles to the Mughal imperial court. The city of Dhaka became one of the most important centers of the cotton textile trade in the 17th century. It was literally the capital of the [[Muslin trade in Bengal]]. Merchants from around the world came to Dhaka to buy its much sought after cotton fabrics. [[UNESCO]] has recognized [[Jamdani]] muslin as an [[intangible cultural heritage]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/unesco-declares-jamdani-saris-intangible-cultural-heritage/articleshow/26927845.cms | title=Unesco declares Jamdani saris intangible cultural heritage | newspaper=The Times of India | date=6 December 2013 }}</ref> According to UNESCO, "Jamdani is a vividly patterned, sheer cotton fabric, traditionally woven on a handloom by craftspeople and apprentices around Dhaka".<ref name="unesco_00879">{{cite web | url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/traditional-art-of-jamdani-weaving-00879#:~:text=The%20Jamdani%20sari%20is%20a,highly%20respected%20for%20their%20skills | title=UNESCO - Traditional art of Jamdani weaving }}</ref> UNESCO believes "the Jamdani sari is a symbol of identity, dignity and self-recognition and provides wearers with a sense of cultural identity and social cohesion.

The architectural history of Dhaka can be subdivided into the Mughal, British, and modern periods. As a result, Dhaka has landmarks of [[Mughal architecture]], [[Indo-Saracenic architecture]], and [[modernist architecture]].
