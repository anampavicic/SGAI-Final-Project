==History==
The area of the modern city of Habikino was within ancient [[Kawachi Province]] and is located on the route of the Take-no-uchi Kaidō, a highway which connected the ancient capitals of [[Asuka, Nara|Asuka]] and [[Heijō-kyō]] with the coast. Numerous ''[[kofun]]'' [[burial mounds]] were built in the area during the [[Kofun period]], including many attributed to early Emperors. During the [[Heian period]], the area was controlled by the [[Kawachi Genji]] clan, the ancestors of the [[Minamoto clan]] who dominated Japan during the [[Kamakura period]].

After the [[Meiji restoration]], the area became part of Osaka Prefecture from 1881. The villages of Furuichi, Imagatani, and Nishiura were created with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. On April 1, 1896 the area became part of [[Minamikawachi District, Osaka]]. Furuichi was elevated to town status on October 1, 1916. On September 30, 1956, Furuichi merged with the town of Takawashi and the villages of  Nanyu, Nishiura, Imagatani, and Tanpi to form the town of {{nihongo|'''Minami-Osaka'''|南大阪町||}}. On April 1, 1957, Minami-Osaka annexed the neighboring village of Mihara. On January 15, 1959, Minami-Osaka was elevated to city status, and took the name of Habikino.
