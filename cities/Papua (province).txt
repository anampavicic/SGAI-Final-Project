The island of New Guinea has been populated for tens of thousands of years. European traders began frequenting the region around the late 16th century due to [[spice trade]]. In the end, the [[Dutch Empire]] emerged as the dominant leader in the spice war, annexing the western part of New Guinea into the colony of [[Dutch East Indies]]. The Dutch remained in New Guinea until 1962, even though other parts of the former colony has [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|declared independence]] as the [[Indonesia|Republic of Indonesia]] in 1945.<ref>Vickers (2005), p. 139</ref> Following negotiations and conflicts with the Indonesian government, the Dutch transferred Western New Guinea to a [[United Nations Temporary Executive Authority]] (UNTEA), which was again transferred to Indonesia after the controversial [[Act of Free Choice]].<ref name="McDonald 1980 36">{{Cite book |last=McDonald |first=Hamish |title=Suharto's Indonesia |publisher=Fontana Books |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-00-635721-6 |location=Blackburn, Victoria |page=36}}</ref> The province was formerly called [[Western New Guinea#Name|Irian Jaya]] and comprised the entire Western New Guinea until the inauguration of the province of West Papua (then West Irian Jaya) in 2001.

There are several theories regarding the origin of the word Papua. One theory is that the name comes from the word 'Papo Ua', named by the [[Sultanate of Tidore|Tidore Sultanate]], which in the [[Tidore language]] means "not joining" or "not being united", meaning that there was no king who rules the area.''{{sfn|Saragih|2019|p=8}}'' Before the age of colonization, the Tidore Sultanate controlled some parts of the [[Bird's Head Peninsula]] in what is now the provinces of [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]] and [[Southwest Papua]] before expanding to also include coastal regions in the current province of Papua. This relationship plays an important historical role in binding the archipelagic civilizations of Indonesia to the Papuan world.<ref>[https://open.lnu.se/index.php/hn/article/view/389/336 Trajectories of the early-modern kingdoms in eastern Indonesia]</ref> Another theory is that the word ''Papua'' comes from the [[Malay language|Malay]] word 'papuwah', which means 'frizzled hair'. It was first mentioned in the 1812 ''Malay Dictionary'' by [[William Marsden (orientalist)|William Marsden]], although it was not found in earlier dictionaries.<ref name="Sollewijn Gelpke 1993 pp. 318–332">{{cite journal | last=Sollewijn Gelpke | first=J.H.F. | title=On the origin of the name Papua | journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde / Journal of the Humanities and Social Sciences of Southeast Asia | publisher=Brill | volume=149 | issue=2 | year=1993 | issn=0006-2294 | doi=10.1163/22134379-90003129 | pages=318–332| doi-access=free }}</ref> In the records of 16th century [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] sailors, the word 'Papua' is the designation for the inhabitants of the [[Raja Ampat Islands]] and the coastal parts of the Bird's Head Peninsula.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Kustiani |first=Rini |date=29 October 2020 |title=Asal Usul Nama Papua, Ada di Catatan Pelaut Portugis dan Spanyol |url=https://travel.tempo.co/read/1400439/asal-usul-nama-papua-ada-di-catatan-pelaut-portugis-dan-spanyol|access-date=25 February 2021 |website=Tempo |language=id}}</ref>
The former name of the province, Irian Jaya, was suggested during a tribal committee meeting in Tobati, Jayapura, formed by Atmoprasojo, head of the bestuur school in the 1940s.

Ghau Yu Kuan, a Chinese merchant, came to Papua around the latter half of 500 AD and referred to it as ''Tungki'', the area where they obtained spices. Meanwhile, in the latter half of 600 AD, the [[Sumatra]]-based empire of [[Srivijaya]] referred to the island as ''Janggi''. The empire engaged in trade relations with western New Guinea, initially taking items like [[sandalwood]] and [[birds-of-paradise]] in [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|tribute to China]], but later making slaves out of the Papuan people.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Singh |first=Bilveer |title=Papua: Geopolitics and the Quest for Nationhood |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2008 |page=15}}</ref> It was only at the beginning of 700 AD that traders from [[Iran|Persia]] and [[Gujarat]] began to arrive in what is now Papua and called it ''Dwi Panta'' or ''Samudrananta'', which means 'at edge of the ocean'.

According to some linguists, the word ''Ewanin'' is another name for Onin as recorded in old communal poems or songs from Wersar, while ''Sran'' popularly misunderstood to refers to [[Seram Island]] in [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], is more likely another name for a local Papuan kingdom which in its native language is called [[Kingdom of Kaimana|Sran Eman Muun]], based in Kaimana and its furthest influence extends to the [[Kai Islands|Kei Islands]], in southeastern Maluku.

[[Dutch New Guinea]] in the early 19th century was administered from the [[Moluccas]]. Although the coast had been mapped in 1825 by Lieutenant Commander D.H. Kolff, there had been no serious effort to establish a permanent presence in Dutch New Guinea. The British, however, had shown considerable interest in the area, and were threatening to settle it. To prevent this, the Governor of the Moluccas, [[Pieter Merkus]], urged the Dutch government to establish posts along the coast.{{sfn|Singh|2017|p=10}} An administrative and trading post established in 1828 on Triton Bay on the southwest coast of New Guinea.

Great Britain and Germany had recognized the Dutch claims in treaties of 1885 and 1895. At the same time, Britain claimed south-east New Guinea, later as the [[Territory of Papua]], and Germany claimed the northeast, later known as the [[German New Guinea|Territory of New Guinea]].

Dutch activity in the region remained in the first half of the twentieth century, notwithstanding the 1923 establishment of the ''Nieuw Guinea Beweging'' (New Guinea Movement) in the Netherlands by ultra right-wing supporters calling for Dutchmen to create a tropical Netherlands in Papua. This pre-war movement without full government support was largely unsuccessful in its drive, but did coincide with the development of a plan for Eurasian settlement of the Dutch Indies to establish Dutch farms in northern West New Guinea. This effort also failed as most returned to Java disillusioned, and by 1938 just 50 settlers remained near Hollandia and 258 in [[Manokwari]].

Following the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], the Netherlands formally transferred sovereignty to the [[United States of Indonesia]], on 27 December 1949. However, the Dutch refused to include [[Netherlands New Guinea]] in the new Indonesian Republic and took steps to prepare it for independence as a separate country. Following the failure of the Dutch and Indonesians to resolve their differences over West New Guinea during the [[Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference]] in late 1949, it was decided that the present status quo of the territory would be maintained and then negotiated bilaterally one year after the date of the transfer of sovereignty.<ref>Audrey and George Kahin, ''Subversion as Foreign Policy'', p.34</ref> However, both sides were still unable to resolve their differences in 1950, which led the Indonesian President [[Sukarno]] to accuse the Dutch of reneging on their promises to negotiate the handover of the territory.

In response to Indonesian aggression, the Netherlands government stepped up its efforts to prepare the Papuan people for self-determination in 1959. These efforts culminated in the establishment of a hospital in Hollandia (modern–day Jayapura, currently Jayapura Regional General Hospital or RSUD Jayapura), a shipyard in [[Manokwari]], agricultural research sites, plantations, and a military force known as the [[Papuan Volunteer Corps]]. By 1960, a legislative [[New Guinea Council]] had been established with a mixture of legislative, advisory and policy functions.

Following the Act of Free Choice in 1969, Western New Guinea was formally integrated into the Republic of Indonesia. Instead of a referendum of the 816,000 Papuans, only 1,022 Papuan tribal representatives were allowed to vote, and they were coerced into voting in favor of integration. While several international observers including journalists and diplomats criticized the referendum as being rigged, the U.S. and Australia support Indonesia's efforts to secure acceptance in the United Nations for the pro-integration vote. That same year, 84 member states voted in favor for the United Nations to accept the result, with 30 others abstaining.<ref>Ron Crocombe, 284</ref> Due to the Netherlands' efforts to promote a West Papuan national identity, a significant number of Papuans refused to accept the territory's integration into Indonesia.

In January 2003 President [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]] signed an order dividing Papua into three provinces: Central Irian Jaya (Irian Jaya Tengah), Papua (or East Irian Jaya, Irian Jaya Timur), and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]] (Irian Jaya Barat). The formality of installing a local government for Jakarta in Irian Jaya Barat (West) took place in February 2003 and a governor was appointed in November; a government for Irian Jaya Tengah (Central Irian Jaya) was delayed from August 2003 due to violent local protests. The creation of this separate Central Irian Jaya Province was blocked by Indonesian courts, who declared it to be unconstitutional and in contravention of the Papua's special autonomy agreement. The previous division into two provinces was allowed to stand as an established fact.<ref>King, Peter, ''West Papua Since Suharto: Independence, Autonomy, or Chaos?''.

=== Government ===
[[File:Logo Majelis Rakyat Papua.jpg|thumb|The Papuan People's Assembly is created formally in 2001 to administer the Papuan Special Autonomy]]
The province of Papua is governed by a directly elected governor and a regional legislature, [[People's Representative Council]] of Papua (''Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Papua'', abbreviated as DPRP or DPR Papua).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blades |first1=Johnny |title=Governor of Indonesia's Papua seeks connection with PNG |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/366810/governor-of-indonesia-s-papua-seeks-connection-with-png |website=Radio New Zealand |access-date=24 January 2019 |language=en-nz |date=19 September 2018}}</ref> A unique government organization in the province is the Papuan People's Assembly (''Majelis Rakyat Papua''), which was formed by the [[Government of Indonesia|Indonesian government]] in 2005, as mandated by the Papua Special Autonomy Law, as a coalition of Papuan tribal chiefs, Papuan religious leaders, and Papuan women representatives, tasked with arbitration and speaking on behalf of Papuan tribal customs.<ref>{{Cite web |title=PP 54–2004::Majelis Rakyat Papua (MRP) |url=https://ngada.org/pp54-2004bt.htm |access-date=26 February 2021 |website=ngada.org |archive-date=13 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210813140543/https://ngada.org/pp54-2004bt.htm }}</ref>

Since 2014, the DPRP has 55 members who are elected through General elections every five years and 14 people who are appointed through the special autonomy, bringing the total number of DPRP members to 69 people. The DPRP leadership consists of 1 Chairperson and 3 Deputy Chairmen who come from political parties that have the most seats and votes. The current DPRP members are the results of the [[2019 Indonesian general election|2019 General Election]] which was sworn in on 31 October 2019 by the Chairperson of the Jayapura High Court at the Papua DPR Building.<ref>{{Cite web |last=T |title=55 Anggota DPR Papua Resmi Dilantik |url=https://www.dharapospapua.com/2014/10/55-anggota-dpr-papua-resmi-dilantik.html|access-date=26 February 2021 |website=Dharapos Papua}}</ref> The composition of DPRP members for the 2019–2024 period consists of 13 political parties where the [[Nasdem Party]] is the political party with the most seats, with 8 seats, followed by the [[Democratic Party (Indonesia)|Democratic Party]] which also won 8 seats and the [[Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle]] which won 7 seats.

The province of Papua is one of seven provinces to have obtained special autonomy status, the others being [[Aceh]], [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]], [[Southwest Papua]], [[Central Papua]], [[Highland Papua]] and [[South Papua]] (the Special Regions of [[Jakarta]] and [[Yogyakarta Special Region|Yogyakarta]] have a similar province-level special status). According to Law 21/2001 on Special Autonomy Status ''(UU Nomor 21 Tahun 2001 tentang Otonomi khusus Papua),'' the provincial government of Papua is provided with authority within all sectors of administration, except for the five strategic areas of foreign affairs, security and defense, monetary and fiscal affairs, religion and justice. The provincial government is authorized to issue local regulations to further stipulate the implementation of the special autonomy, including regulating the authority of districts and municipalities within the province. Due to its special autonomy status, Papua province is provided with significant amount of special autonomy funds, which can be used to benefit its [[Indigenous people of New Guinea|indigenous peoples]]. But the province has low fiscal capacity and it is highly dependent on unconditional transfers and the above-mentioned special autonomy fund, which accounted for about 55% of total revenues in 2008.

After obtaining its special autonomy status, to allow the local population access to timber production benefits, the Papuan provincial government issued a number of decrees, enabling:
* a Timber Logging Permit for Customary Communities, which enabled local people to carry out timber extraction in small concessions (250 to 1,000 hectares) for one year through a community-based or participatory community cooperative;
* a Permit to Manage Customary Forests, which was a timber extraction permit for larger concessions (up to 2,000 hectares) for a maximum of 20 years;
* logging companies had to pay compensations to local communities in addition to all other fees and taxes collected by the national government.

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Indonesia}}
As of 2022 (following the separation of Central Papua, Highland Papua, and South Papua province), the residual Papua Province consisted of 8 [[Regencies of Indonesia|regencies]] ({{lang|id|kabupaten}}) and one city (''kota''); on the map below, these regencies comprise the northern belt from Waropen Regency to Keerom Regency, plus the island groups to their northwest. Initially the area now forming the present Papua Province contained three regencies - '''Jayapura''', '''Yapen Waropen''' and '''Biak Numfor'''. The '''City of Jayapura''' was separated on 2 August 1993 from Jayapura Regency and formed into a province-level administration. On 11 December 2002 three new regencies were created - '''Keerom''' and '''Sarmi''' from parts of Jayapura Regency, and '''Waropen''' from part of Yapen Waropen Regency (the rest of this regency was renamed as '''Yapen Islands'''). On 18 December 2003 a further regency - '''Supiori''' - was created from part of Biak Numfor Regency, and on 15 March 2007 a further regency - '''Mamberamo Raya''' - was created from the western part of Sarmi Regency. These regencies and the city are together subdivided as into [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''distrik''), and thence into "villages" (''kelurahan'' and ''desa''). With the release of the Act Number 21 of 2001 concerning the Special Autonomous Region of Papua Province, the term ''distrik'' was used instead of ''kecamatan'' in the entire [[Western New Guinea]].<ref>{{Cite web |others=Setjen DPR RI |title=J.D.I.H. – Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat |url=http://dpr.go.id/jdih/index/id/352 |website=dpr.go.id |access-date=4 March 2021 |archive-date=18 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210718220444/https://www.dpr.go.id/jdih/index/id/352 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The difference between the two is merely the terminology, with ''kepala distrik'' being the district head.

The province of Papua is located between 2 ° 25'LU – 9 ° S and 130 ° – 141 ° East. The total area of Papua is now {{convert|82,680.95|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Until its division in 2022 into four provinces, Papua Province was the province that had the largest area in Indonesia, with a total area of 312,816.35&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, or 19.33% of the total area of the [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indonesian archipelago]]. The boundaries of Papua are: Pacific Ocean (North), [[Highland Papua]] (South), [[Central Papua]] (Southwest) and [[Papua New Guinea]] (East). Papua, like most parts of Indonesia, has two seasons, the dry season and the rainy season. From June to September the wind flows from Australia and does not contain much water vapor resulting in a dry season.

Another major habitat feature is the vast northern lowlands. Stretching for hundreds of kilometers, these include lowland rainforests, extensive wetlands, savanna grasslands, and some of the largest expanses of mangrove forest in the world. The northern lowlands are drained principally by the province's largest river, the [[Mamberamo River]] and its tributaries on the western side, and by the [[Sepik]] on the eastern side.<ref name="geofeact">{{Cite web |date=2015-08-21 |title=Yos Sudarso Island |url=https://geofactoftheday.blogspot.com/2015/08/yos-sudarso-island.html |access-date=2023-03-23 |website=GeoFact of the Day}}</ref> The result is a large area of lakes and rivers known as the Lakes Plains region.

Papua's gross domestic product grew at a faster rate than the national average until, and throughout the [[1997 Asian financial crisis|financial crisis of 1997–98.]]<ref name=":2" /> However, the differences are much smaller if mining is excluded from the provincial GDP. Given that most mining revenues were commandeered by the [[Government of Indonesia|central government]] until the Special Autonomy Law was passed in 2001, provincial GDP without mining is most likely a better measure of Papuan GDP during the pre- and immediate post-crisis periods. On a per capita basis, the GDP growth rates for both Papua and Indonesia are lower than those for total GDP. However, the gap between per capita GDP and total GDP is larger for Papua than for Indonesia as a whole, reflecting Papua's high population growth rates.<ref name=":2" />

Although Papua has experienced almost no growth in GDP, the situation is not as serious as one might think. It is true that the mining sector, dominated by [[Freeport-McMoRan|Freeport Indonesia]], has been declining over the last decade or so, leading to a fall in the value of exports. On the other hand, government spending and fixed capital investment have both grown, by well over 10 per cent per year, contributing to growth in sectors such as finance, construction, transport and communications, and trade, hotels and restaurants. With so many sectors still experiencing respectable levels of growth, the impact of the stagnant economy on the welfare of the population will probably be limited. It should also be remembered that mining is typically an enclave activity; its impact on the general public is fairly limited, regardless of whether it is booming or contracting.<ref>Weisskoff and Wolf, 1977</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite book |last1=Resosudarmo |first1=Budy |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323887003 |title=Development in Papua after special autonomy |last2=Mollet |first2=Julius |last3=Raya |first3=Umbu |last4=Kaiwai |first4=Hans |chapter=18.

[[File:Grasberg mine.jpg|left|thumb|Grasberg Mine in [[Mimika Regency]]. Mining is the most important sector in the province]]
Papua has depended heavily on natural resources, especially the mining, oil and gas sectors, since the mid-1970s.<ref>Manning and Rumbiak, 1989</ref><ref>Resosudarmo et al. 2009a</ref> Although this is still the case, there have been some structural changes in the two provincial economies since the split in 2003. The contribution of mining to the economy of Papua province declined from 62 per cent in 2003 to 47 per cent in 2012. The shares of agriculture and manufacturing also fell, but that of utilities remained the same. A few other sectors, notably construction and services, increased their shares during the period. Despite these structural changes, the economy of Papua province continues to be dominated by the mining sector, and in particular by a single company, [[Freeport indonesia]].<ref name=":3" />

Mining is still and remains one of the dominant economic sector in Papua. The [[Grasberg Mine]], the world's largest gold mine and second-largest copper mine,<ref>{{cite web |title=Grasberg Open Pit, Indonesia |url=http://www.mining-technology.com/projects/grasbergopenpit|access-date=16 October 2017 |website=Mining Technology}}</ref> is located in the highlands near [[Puncak Jaya]], the highest mountain in Papua and whole [[Indonesia]]. Grasberg Mine producing 1.063&nbsp;billion pounds of copper, 1.061&nbsp;million ounces gold and 2.9&nbsp;million ounces silver. It has 19,500 employees operated by PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI) which used to be 90.64% owned by [[Freeport-McMoran]] (FCX). In August 2017, FCX announced that it will divest its ownership in PT-FI so that Indonesia owns 51%. In return the CoW will be replaced by a special license (IUPK) with mining rights to 2041 and FCX will build a new smelter by 2022.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Freeport-McMoRan Announces Framework for Agreement with Indonesian Government Regarding Long-Term Operating Rights for PT Freeport Indonesia |url=https://ptfi.co.id/media/files/press/59a609a0a937c_fcx-news_release_082917_eng.pdf |website=PT Freeport Indonesia|access-date=16 October 2017 |date=29 August 2017}}</ref><ref name="MINING17">{{cite news |last1=Jamasmie |first1=Cecilia |date=29 August 2017 |title=Freeport to yield control of giant Grasberg copper mine to Indonesia |work=MINING.com |url=http://www.mining.com/freeport-to-yield-control-of-giant-grasberg-copper-mine-to-indonesia/|access-date=16 October 2017}}</ref>
[[File:Raiyani Muharramah kapal suku biak waiwor-0978.jpg|thumb|Fishing boats in [[Biak]]]]
Besides mining, there are at least three other important economic sectors (excluding the government sector) in the Papuan economy. The first is agriculture, particularly food crops, [[forestry]] and [[Fishery|fisheries]]. Agriculture made up 10.4 per cent of provincial GDP in 2005 but grew at an average rate of only 0.1 per cent per annum in 2000–05. The second important sector is trade, hotels and restaurants, which contributed 4.0 per cent of provincial GDP in 2005. Within this sector, trade contributed most to provincial GDP. However, the subsector with the highest growth rate was hotels, which grew at 13.2 per cent per annum in 2000–05. The third important sector is transport and Communications, which contributed 3.4 per cent of provincial GDP in 2005. The sector grew at an average annual rate of 5.3 percent in 2000–05, slightly below the national level. Within the sector, [[Maritime transport|sea transport]], air transport and communications performed particularly well. The role of private enterprise in developing communications and [[Aviation|air transport]] has become increasingly significant. Since private enterprise will only expand if businesspeople see good prospects to make a profit, this is certainly an encouraging development. At current rates of growth, the transport and communications sector could support the development of agriculture in Papua. However, so far, most of the growth in communications has been between the rapidly expanding urban areas of [[Jayapura]], [[Timika]] and [[Merauke]] (the latter two now in the new provinces of Central Papua and South Papua respectively), and between them and the rest of Indonesia. Nevertheless, in the medium term, improved communication networks may create opportunities for Papua to shift from heavy dependence on the mining sector to greater reliance on the agricultural sector. With good international demand for [[palm oil]] anticipated in the medium term, production of this commodity could be expanded.<ref name=":2" /> However, the negative effects of deforestation on the local environment should be a major consideration in the selection of new areas for this and any other plantation crop.<ref name=":2" /> In 2011, Papuan caretaker governor Syamsul Arief Rivai claimed Papua's forests cover 42 million hectares with an estimated worth of Rp 700&nbsp;trillion ($78&nbsp;billion) and that if the forests were managed properly and sustainably, they could produce over 500&nbsp;million cubic meters of logs per annum.<ref>{{cite web |date=24 August 2011 |title=Forests in Papua are valued at $78&nbsp;billion |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/08/24/forests-papua-are-valued-78-billion.html}}</ref>

Manufacturing and banking make up a tiny proportion of the regional economy and experienced negative growth in 2000–05.<ref name=":2" /> Poor infrastructure and lack of human capital are the most likely reasons for the poor performance of manufacturing.<ref name=":2" /> In addition, the costs of manufacturing are typically very high in Papua, as they are in many other [[List of outlying islands of Indonesia|outer island regions of Indonesia]]. Both within Indonesia and in the world economy, Papua's comparative advantage will continue to lie in agriculture and natural resource-based industries for a long time to come. A more significant role for manufacturing is unlikely given the far lower cost of labor and better infrastructure in [[Java]]. But provided that there are substantial improvements in infrastructure and communications, over the longer term manufacturing can be expected to cluster around activities related to agriculture—for example, food processing.<ref name=":2" />

== Infrastructure ==
Compared to other parts of [[Indonesia]], the infrastructure in Papua is one of the most least developed, owing to its distance from the national capital [[Jakarta]]. Nevertheless, for the past few years, the [[Government of Indonesia|central government]] has invested significant sums of money to build and improve the current infrastructure in the province.<ref name=":18" /><ref>{{Cite web |last=Kusumasomantri |first=Aisha Rasyidila |date=11 March 2020 |title=Rethinking infrastructure approach in Papua |url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2020/03/11/rethinking-infrastructure-approach-in-papua.html |access-date=26 February 2021 |website=The Jakarta Post |language=en}}</ref> The infrastructure development efforts of the [[Ministry of Public Works and Housing (Indonesia)|Ministry of Public Works and Housing]] in Papua have been very massive in the last 10 years. This effort is carried out to accelerate equitable development and support regional development in Papua. The main focus of infrastructure development in Papua is to improve regional connectivity, improve the quality of life through the provision of basic infrastructure and increase food security through the development of water resources infrastructure. The achievements and conditions of infrastructure development in Papua until 2017 have shown significant progress.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://sibasripi-pupr.pu.go.id/assets/files/gap_analysis/Profil%20Provinsi%20Papua.pdf |title=Profil Pengembangan Wilayah Provinsi Papua |publisher=Indonesian Ministry of Public Works and Housing |access-date=4 March 2021 |archive-date=12 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210812205645/http://sibasripi-pupr.pu.go.id/assets/files/gap_analysis/Profil%20Provinsi%20Papua.pdf }}</ref>

=== Energy and water resources ===
Electricity distribution in the province as well as the whole country is operated and managed by the [[Perusahaan Listrik Negara]] (PLN). Originally, most Papuan villages do not have access to electricity. The Indonesia government through the [[Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (Indonesia)|Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources]], in the beginning of year 2016, introduced a program named "Indonesia Terang" or Bright Indonesia. The aimed of this program is to speed up Electrification Rate (ER) with priority to the six provinces at Eastern area of Indonesia including Papua Province. The target of Indonesian's ER by 2019 is 97%. While the Indonesian's national ER already high (88.30%) in 2015, Papua still the lowest ER (45.93%) among the provinces. The scenario to boost up ER in the Eastern area by connected the consumers at villages which not electrified yet to the new Renewable Energy sources.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal |last1=Innah |first1=Herbert |last2=Kariongan |first2=Jackobus |last3=Liga |first3=Marthen |date=2017 |title=Electrification ratio and renewable energy in Papua Province |journal=AIP Conference Proceedings |volume=1826 |issue=1 |location=Bogor, Indonesia |pages=020036 |doi=10.1063/1.4979252 |bibcode=2017AIPC.1826b0036I|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The percentage of household that were connected to the electricity in Papua (Electrification ratio/ER) is the lowest one among the provinces in Indonesia.<ref name=":4" /> Data from the [[Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (Indonesia)|Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources]] shows that only Papua Province has ER level below 50% (45.93%) with the national average RE was 88.30%.<ref name=":4" /> High ER of more than 85% can be found in the rest of west area of the country. The main reason of lowest ER in Papua is a huge area with landlocked and mountain situation and low density population. Energy consumption in residential sector, 457 GWh in year 2014, contributes the electrification rate in Papua Province. But again, geographic and demographic obstacle made the electrical energy not well dispersed in Papua. The ER levels are usually higher in the coastal area but become low in the mountain area.<ref name=":4" /> These can be seen by the formation of new provinces in 2022: Papua Province has an ER of 89.22%, while the former regions of South Papua has an ER of 73.54%, Central Papua has an ER of 47.36%, and Highland Papua has an ER of 12.09%.<ref name="Muhamad 2023">{{cite web | last=Muhamad | first=Nabilah | title=Deretan Provinsi dengan Rasio Elektrifikasi Rumah Tangga Terendah Nasional 2022, Indonesia Timur Mendominasi | website=Databoks | date=2023-07-11 | url=https://databoks.katadata.co.id/datapublish/2023/07/11/deretan-provinsi-dengan-rasio-elektrifikasi-rumah-tangga-terendah-nasional-2022-indonesia-timur-mendominasi | access-date=2023-11-11}}</ref>

Achieving universal access to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene is essential to accelerating progress in the fields of health, education and poverty alleviation. In 2015, about a quarter of the population used basic sanitation facilities at home, while a third still practiced [[open defecation]]. The coverage of improved drinking water sources is much higher, both in households and schools. Inequality based on income and residence levels is stark, demonstrating the importance of integrating equity principles into policy and practice and expanding the coverage of community-based total sanitation programs.<ref>{{Cite web |title=SDG untuk Anak-Anak di Indonesia.

=== Internet and telecommunication ===
Papua is one of the larger province in [[Indonesia]], but it has the least amount of telecommunications services due to geographic isolation. The deployment of service to the district and to the sub district is still not evenly distributed. The distribution of telecommunication services in Papua is still very uneven. This is indicated by the percentage of the number of telecommunication services and infrastructure whose distribution is centralized in certain areas such as [[Jayapura]]. Based on data, the [[Human Development Index]] in Papua increases every year but is not accompanied by an increase adequate number of telecommunication facilities.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Ibnugraha |first1=P.

The [[Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (Indonesia)|Ministry of Communication and Information Technology]] through the Information Technology Accessibility Agency (BAKTI) has built around 9 base transceiver stations in remote areas of Papua, namely [[Puncak Jaya Regency]] and [[Mamberamo Raya Regency]], to connect to internet access. In the early stages, the internet was prioritized to support the continuity of education, health and better public services. To realize connectivity in accordance with government priorities, the Ministry of Communication and Information is determined to reach all districts in the Papua region with high-speed internet networks by 2020. It is planned that all districts in Papua and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]] will build a fast internet backbone network. There are 31 regencies that have new high-speed internet access to be built.<ref>{{Cite web |others=PDSI KOMINFO |title=Akses Internet Jangkau Pelosok Papua |url=https://www.kominfo.go.id/content/detail/13517/akses-internet-jangkau-pelosok-papua/0/sorotan_media |access-date=27 February 2021 |website=Website Resmi Kementerian Komunikasi dan Informatika RI |publisher=Investor Daily |language=id}}</ref>

In late 2019, the government announced the completion of the Palapa Ring project – a priority infrastructure project that aimed to provide access to 4G internet services to more than 500 regencies across Indonesia, Papua included. The project is estimated to have cost US$1.5&nbsp;billion and comprises {{convert|35,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} of undersea fiber-optic cables and {{convert|21,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} of land cables, stretching from the westernmost city in Indonesia, [[Sabang, Aceh|Sabang]] to the easternmost town, [[Merauke]], which is located in Papua. Additionally, the cables also transverse every district from the northernmost island [[Miangas]] to the southernmost island, [[Rote Island|Rote]]. Through the Palapa Ring, the government can facilitate a network capacity of up to 100&nbsp;Gbit/s in even the most outlying regions of the country.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Medina |first=Ayman Falak |date=28 January 2020 |title=Indonesia's Palapa Ring: Bringing Connectivity to the Archipelago |url=https://www.aseanbriefing.com/news/indonesias-palapa-ring-bringing-connectivity-archipelago/ |access-date=27 February 2021 |website=ASEAN Business News |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Kakisina |first=Ernes Broning |editor-last=Yusuf |editor-first=Muhammad |location=[[Sorong]] |publisher=antaranews.com |date=14 October 2019 |title=Ring Timur menjawab kesulitan telekomunikasi di pelosok Papua |url=https://www.antaranews.com/berita/1112644/ring-timur-menjawab-kesulitan-telekomunikasi-di-pelosok-papua|access-date=27 February 2021 |website=Antara News}}</ref>

=== Transportation ===

==== Land ====
[[File:Teras Republik Indonesia di Skouw Jayapura.jpg|thumb|Skouw border checkpoint, on the [[Indonesia–Papua New Guinea border|Indonesia-Papua New Guinea border]]]]
So far, air routes have been a mainstay in Papua and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]] provinces as a means of transporting people and goods, including basic necessities, due to inadequate road infrastructure conditions. This has resulted in high distribution costs which have also increased the prices of various staple goods, especially in rural areas. Therefore, the government is trying to reduce distribution costs by building the [[Trans-Papua Highway]].<ref name=":5">{{Cite web |title=Meningkatkan Kesejahteraan Papua Melalui Pembangunan Transportasi Darat |url=http://lipi.go.id/berita/single/Meningkatkan-Kesejahteraan-Papua-Melalui-Pembangunan-Transportasi-Darat/12374|access-date=27 February 2021 |website=lipi.go.id |language=id}}</ref> As of 2016, the Trans-Papua highway that has been connected has reached 3,498 kilometers, with asphalt roads for 2,075 kilometers, while the rest are still dirt roads, and roads that have not been connected have reached 827&nbsp;km. The development of the Trans-Papua highway will create connectivity between regions so that it can have an impact on the acceleration of economic growth in Papua and West Papua in the long term. Apart from the construction of the Trans-Papua highway, the government is also preparing for the first railway development project in Papua, which is currently entering the feasibility study phase. The said infrastructure funding for Papua is not insignificant. The need to connect all roads in Papua and West Papua is estimated at Rp. 12.5&nbsp;trillion (US$870&nbsp;million). In the 2016 State Budget, the government has also budgeted an additional infrastructure development fund of Rp. 1.8&nbsp;trillion (US$126&nbsp;million).<ref name=":5" />

Data from the [[Ministry of Public Works and Housing (Indonesia)|Ministry of Public Works and Housing]] (KPUPR) states, the length of the Trans-Papua highway in Papua reaches 2,902&nbsp;km. These include [[Merauke]]-[[Tanahmerah]]-Waropko (543&nbsp;km), Waropko-[[Oksibil, Pegunungan Bintang|Oksibil]] (136&nbsp;km), [[Dekai]]-[[Oksibil, Pegunungan Bintang|Oksibil]] (225&nbsp;km), and [[Kenyam]]-[[Dekai]] (180&nbsp;km).

==== Air ====
[[File:Aerial view of Sentani Airport 20130412.jpg|thumb|[[Sentani International Airport]] in [[Jayapura]] is the principal point of entry to Papua]]
The geographical conditions of Papua which are hilly and have dense forests and do not have adequate road infrastructure, such as in Java or [[Sumatra]], make transportation a major obstacle for local communities. Air transportation using airplanes is by far the most effective means of transportation and is needed most by the inhabitants of the island, although it is not cheap for it. A number of airlines are also scrambling to take advantage of the geographical conditions of the island by opening busy routes to and from a number of cities, both district and provincial capitals. If seen from the sufficient condition of the airport infrastructure, there are not a few airports that can be landed by jets like [[Boeing]] and [[Airbus]] as well as propeller planes such as [[ATR (aircraft manufacturer)|ATR]] and [[Cessna]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Wijaya |first=Ahmad |date=24 July 2017 |title=Membuka transportasi udara di Papua |work=Antaranews|editor-last=Burhani|editor-first=Ruslan |url=https://www.antaranews.com/berita/642391/membuka-transportasi-udara-di-papua|access-date=27 February 2021}}</ref>

[[Sentani International Airport]] in [[Jayapura]] is the largest airport in the province, serving as the main gateway to the province from other parts of [[Indonesia]]. The air traffic is roughly divided between flights connecting to destinations within the Papua province and flights linking Papua to other parts of Indonesia. The airport connects [[Jayapura]] with other Indonesian cities such as [[Manado]], [[Makassar]], [[Surabaya]] and [[Jakarta]], as well as towns within the province such as [[Biak]], [[Timika]] and [[Merauke]]. Sentani International Airport is also the main base for several aviation organizations, including Associated Mission Aviation, [[Mission Aviation Fellowship]], [[JAARS|YAJASI]] and Tariku Aviation. The airport currently does not have any international flights, although there are plans to open new airline routes to neighboring [[Papua New Guinea]] in the future.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bonauli |title=Papua-Papua Nugini, Tetangga Tapi Tak Punya Penerbangan Langsung |url=https://travel.detik.com/international-destination/d-5074167/papua-papua-nugini-tetangga-tapi-tak-punya-penerbangan-langsung|access-date=27 February 2021 |website=detikTravel |location=[[Jayapura]] |publisher=[[Detik.com|detikcom]] |language=id}}</ref> Other medium-sized airports in the province are [[Mozes Kilangin Airport]] in Timika, [[Mopah International Airport]] in [[Merauke]], [[Frans Kaisiepo International Airport]] in [[Biak]], and [[Wamena Airport]] in [[Wamena]].

In contrast to other Indonesian provinces, which are mostly dominated by [[Austronesian peoples]], Papua and West Papua as well as some part of [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] are home to the [[Melanesians]]. The [[Indigenous people of New Guinea|indigenous Papuans]] which are part of the Melanesians forms the majority of the population in the province. Many believe human habitation on the island dates to as early as 50,000 [[Before Christ|BC]],<ref>{{Cite news |last=Lyn |first=Tan Ee |date=30 September 2010 |title=Anthropology Professor Glenn Summerhayes, University of Otago, New Zealand.

The island of [[New Guinea]] is presently populated by almost a thousand different tribal groups and a near-equivalent number of separate languages, which makes it the most linguistically diverse area in the world. Current evidence indicates that the Papuans (who constitute the majority of the island's peoples) are descended from the earliest human inhabitants of New Guinea. These original inhabitants first arrived in New Guinea at a time (either side of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], approx 21,000 years ago) when the island was connected to the Australian continent via a [[land bridge]], forming the landmass of [[Australia (continent)|Sahul]]. These peoples had made the (shortened) sea-crossing from the islands of [[Wallacea]] and [[Sundaland]] (the present [[Malay Archipelago]]) by at least 40,000 years ago.

The ancestral [[Austronesian peoples]] are believed to have arrived considerably later, approximately 3,500 years ago, as part of a gradual seafaring migration from Southeast Asia, possibly originating in [[Taiwan]]. Austronesian-speaking peoples colonized many of the offshore islands to the north and east of New Guinea, such as [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] and [[New Britain]], with settlements also on the coastal fringes of the main island in places. Human habitation of [[New Guinea]] over tens of thousands of years has led to a great deal of diversity, which was further increased by the later arrival of the Austronesians and the more recent history of European and Asian settlement.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Simanjuntak |first1=Truman |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/73745051 |title=Austronesian diaspora and the ethnogeneses of people in Indonesian archipelago : proceedings of the international symposium |last2=Pojoh |first2=Ingrid Harriet Eileen |last3=Hisyam |first3=Muhamad |date=2006 |publisher=LIPI Press |isbn=979-26-2436-8 |location=Jakarta, Indonesia |pages=61 |oclc=73745051}}</ref>

=== Language ===
{{Main|Papuan languages}}
[[File:TNG map.svg|thumb|[[Trans–New Guinea languages|Trans-New Guinea languages]] (multi-coloured), [[Austronesian languages]] (gold), and other languages (grey)]]
Papua, the easternmost region of the [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indonesian archipelago]], exhibits a very complex linguistic network. The diversity of languages and the situation of [[multilingualism]] is very real. There are many language families scattered in this wide area, namely the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language]] family and numerous non-Austronesian languages known collectively as [[Papuan languages]]. Speakers of different Austronesian languages are found in coastal communities, such as [[Biak language|Biak]], [[Wamesa language|Wandamen]], [[Waropen language|Waropen]] and [[Ma'ya language|Ma'ya.]] On the other hand, Papuan languages are spoken in the interior and [[New Guinea Highlands|Central Highlands]], starting from the [[Bird's Head Peninsula]] in the west to the eastern tip of the island of New Guinea, for example [[Maybrat language|Meybrat]], [[Dani languages|Dani]], [[Ekari language|Ekari]], [[Asmat languages|Asmat]], [[Muyu language|Muyu]] and [[Sentani language]].<ref>Mansoben 1994: 31</ref><ref name=":9">{{Cite journal |last=Gau |first=Sukardi |title=Menjejaki Bahasa Melayu Maluku di Papua: Kerangka Pengenalan |url=https://www.academia.edu/6435397 |journal=Jurnal Elektronik Jabatan Bahasa & Kebudayaan Melayu |language=id |volume=3 |pages=21–40}}</ref>

At this time, research efforts to find out how many indigenous languages in Papua are still being pursued. Important efforts regarding documentation and inventory of languages in Papua have also been carried out by two main agencies, namely [[SIL International]] and the [[Language and Book Development Agency]] in [[Jakarta]]. The results of the research that have been published by the two institutions show that there are differences in the number of regional languages in Papua. The Language and Book Development Agency as the official [[Government of Indonesia|Indonesian government]] agency has announced or published that there are 207 different regional languages in Papua, while [[SIL International]] has stated that there are 271 regional languages in the region.<ref>Ethnologue, 2005</ref><ref name=":9" /> Some of the regional languages of Papua are spoken by a large number of speakers and a wide spread area, some are supported by a small number of speakers and are scattered in a limited environment. However, until now it is estimated that there are still a number of regional languages in Papua that have not been properly studied so that it is not known what the form of the language is. In addition to local languages that have been listed by the two main institutions above, there are also dozens more languages from other islands due to population migration that is not included in the list of local languages in Papua, for example languages from [[Sulawesi]] ([[Buginese language|Bugis]], [[Makassarese language|Makassar]], [[Toraja-Saʼdan language|Toraja]], [[Minahasan languages|Minahasa]]), [[Javanese language|Javanese]] from [[Java]], and local languages from [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]].<ref name=":9" /> So-called Papuan languages comprise hundreds of different languages, most of which are not related.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Palmer |first=Bill |title=The Languages and Linguistics of the New Guinea Area |publisher=Mouton De Gruyter |year=2018 |isbn=978-3-11-028642-7}}</ref>

It emerged as a [[contact language]] among tribes in Indonesian New Guinea for trading and daily communication. Nowadays, it has a growing number of native speakers. More recently, the vernacular of Indonesian [[Papuans]] has been influenced by [[Indonesian language|Standard Indonesian]], the national [[Standard language|standard dialect]]. Some linguists have suggested that Papuan Malay has its roots in [[North Moluccan Malay]], as evidenced by the number of [[Ternate language|Ternate]] loanwords in its lexicon.<ref>{{Cite conference |last1=Allen |first1=Robert B. |last2=Hayami-Allen |first2=Rika |date=2002 |editor-last=Macken |editor-first=M. |contribution=Orientation in the Spice Islands |url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/allen2002orientation.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221225213702/http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/allen2002orientation.pdf |archive-date=2022-12-25 |title=Papers from the Tenth Annual Meeting of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society |location=Tempe, AZ |publisher=Program for Southeast Asian Studies, Arizona State University |page=21 |isbn=1-881044-29-7 |oclc=50506465}}</ref> Others have proposed that it is derived from [[Ambonese Malay]].<ref name="ak2">{{harvp|Kluge|2017|pp=11, 47}}</ref> A large number of local languages are spoken in the province, and the need for a common ''[[lingua franca]]'' has been underlined by the centuries-old traditions of inter-group interaction in the form of slave-hunting, adoption, and intermarriage.<ref name=":9" /> It is likely that Malay was first introduced by the Biak people, who had contacts with the [[Sultanate of Tidore]], and later, in the 19th century, by traders from China and [[South Sulawesi]].

According to Indonesian Citizenship and Civil Registry in 2022, 70.15% of the Papuans identified themselves as Christians, with 64.68% being [[Protestants]] and 5.47% being [[Catholic Church|Catholics]]. 29.56% of the population are [[Muslims]] and less than 1% were [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] or [[Hindus]].<ref name="DUKCAPIL">{{cite web|url=https://gis.dukcapil.kemendagri.go.id/peta/|title=Visualisasi Data Kependudukan - Kementerian Dalam Negeri 2022|website=www.dukcapil.kemendagri.go.id|access-date=31 July 2022|format=Visual}}</ref><!-- Religion data has been separated from three new provinces according to DUKCAPIL--> There is also substantial practice of [[animism]], the traditional religion for many Papuans, with many blending animistic beliefs with other religions such as Christianity and Islam. Christianity, including [[Protestantism]] and [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] are mostly adhered by native Papuans and migrants from [[Maluku (province)|Maluku]], [[East Nusa Tenggara]], [[North Sulawesi]] and [[Batak people|Bataks]] of [[North Sumatra]]. [[Islam]] are mostly adhered by migrants from [[North Maluku]], [[South Sulawesi]] (except [[Torajan people|Torajans]]), western Indonesia, and some native Papuans. Lastly [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] are mostly adhered by [[Balinese people|Balinese]] migrants and [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese-Indonesians]] respectively.

[[Islam]] had been present in Papua since the 15th century, because of interaction with Muslim traders and Moluccan Muslim Sultanates especially the earliest being [[Sultanate of Bacan|Bacan]]. Though there were many earlier theories and folk legends on origin of [[Islam]], sometimes mixed with indigenous folk religion of Fakfak, Kaimana, Bintuni, and Wondama. These include Islamic procession of Hajj pilgrimage that do not go to Meccah, but to Nabi Mountain, near Arguni Bay and Wondama Bay. According to Aceh origins, a [[Samudera Pasai Sultanate|Samudra Pasai]] figure called Tuan Syekh Iskandar Syah was sent to Mesia (Kokas) to preach in Nuu War (Papua), he converted a Papuan called Kriskris by teaching him about ''Alif Lam Ha'' (Allah) and ''Mim Ha Mim Dal'' (Muhammad), he became Imam and first king of Patipi, Fakfak. Syekh Iskandar brought with him some religious texts, which were copied onto Koba-Koba leaves and wood barks. Syekh Iskandar would return to Aceh bringing the original manuscripts, but before that he would visit Moluccas specifically in Sinisore village. This corresponds with the village's origin of Islam that instead came from Papua. A study by Fakfak government, mentioned another Acehnese figure called Abdul Ghafar who visited Old Fatagar in 1502 under the reign of Rumbati King Mansmamor. He would preach in Onin language (lingua franca of the area at the time) and was buried next to village mosque in Rumbati, Patipi Bay, Fakfak. Based on family account of Abdullah Arfan, the dynasty of [[Salawati]] Kingdom, in the 16th century the first Papuan Muslim was Kalewan who married Siti Hawa Farouk, a ''muballighah'' from [[Cirebon]], and changed his name to Bayajid who became the ancestor of Arfan clan.<ref name="Viartasiwi 2013 pp. 860–869">{{cite journal |last=Viartasiwi |first=Nino |year=2013 |title=Holding on a Thin Rope: Muslim Papuan Communities as the Agent of Peace in Papua Conflict |journal=Procedia Environmental Sciences |publisher=Elsevier BV |volume=17 |pages=860–869 |doi=10.1016/j.proenv.2013.02.104 |issn=|doi-access=free |bibcode=2013PrEnS..17..860V }}</ref><ref name="Wanggai 2008"/> Meanwhile, based on oral history of Fakfak and Kaimana, a Sufi by the name of Syarif Muaz al-Qathan from Yaman constructed a mosque in Tunasgain, which was dated using the 8 merbau woods previously used as ceremonial Alif poles for the mosque around every 50 years, to be from 1587. He was also attributed of converting Samay, an Adi Ruler of the royal line of [[Kingdom of Kaimana|Sran]]. Islam only grew in the coastal part of Papua especially in the bird head areas, and did not spread to the interior part of the island until Dutch started sending migrants in 1902 and exiled Indonesian leaders in 1910 to Merauke. [[Muhammadiyah]] figures were exiled in Papua and in their exile help spread Islam in the region. Later on to help members with education issues, Muhammadiyah only formally sent its teacher in 1933. Islam in the interior highland only spread after 1962, after interaction with teachers and migrants as was the case of Jayawijaya and the case of [[Dani people|Dani]] tribe of Megapura. While in Wamena, conversion of Walesi village in 1977 was attributed to Jamaludin Iribaram, a Papuan teacher from [[Fakfak]]. Other smaller indigenous Islamic communities can also be found in Asmat, Yapen, Waropen, Biak, Jayapura, and Manowari.<ref name="Viartasiwi 2013 pp. 860–869"/>

In addition, slaves were bought to be raised as step children and then freed. By 1880, only 20 Papuans had been baptized, including many freed slaves. The Dutch government established posts in [[Netherlands New Guinea]] in 1898, a move welcomed by the missionaries, who saw orderly Dutch rule as the essential antidote to Papua paganism.<ref name="aritonang" /> Subsequently, the UZV mission had more success, with a mass conversion near [[Cenderawasih Bay]] in 1907 and the evangelization of the [[Sentani, Indonesia|Sentani people]] by Pamai, a native Papuan in the late 1920s.<ref name="aritonang" /> Due to the [[Great Depression]], the mission suffered a funding shortfall, and switched to native evangelists, who had the advantage of speaking the local language (rather than Malay), but were often poorly trained.

The first Catholic presence in Papua was in [[Fakfak]], a Jesuit mission in 1894. In 1902 the Vicariate of Netherlands New Guinea was established. Despite the earlier activity in Fakfak, the Dutch restricted the Catholic Church to the southern part of the island, where they were active especially around [[Merauke]].

== Culture ==

The native [[Indigenous people of New Guinea|Papuan people]] has a distinct culture and traditions that cannot be found in other parts of Indonesia. Coastal Papuans are usually more willing to accept modern influence into their daily lives, which in turn diminishes their original culture and traditions. Meanwhile, most inland Papuans still preserves their original culture and traditions, although their way of life over the past century are tied to the encroachment of modernity and [[globalization]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Suyanto |first=Bagong |date=2 November 2011 |title=Jati Diri Papua |url=https://lifestyle.kompas.com/read/2011/11/03/02051319/jati.diri.papua |access-date=4 March 2021 |website=Kompas.com |publisher=Kompas Cyber Media |language=id}}</ref> Each Papuan tribe usually practices their own tradition and culture, which may differ greatly from one tribe to another.

The ''Ararem'' tradition is the tradition of delivering the dowry of a future husband to the family of the prospective wife in the [[Biak]] custom. In the [[Biak language]], the word "Ararem" means dowry. In this procession, the bride and groom will be escorted on foot in a procession, accompanied by songs and dances accompanied by music and. The amount of the dowry is determined by the woman's family as agreed by her relatives. The date of submission of the dowry must be agreed upon by the family of the woman or the family of the prospective wife and the family of the man or family of the prospective husband.

The ''Yospan'' dance ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Tarian Yospan'') is a type of social association dance in Papua which is a traditional dance originating from the coastal regions of Papua, namely [[Biak]], [[Yapen Islands Regency|Yapen]] and [[Waropen Regency|Waropen]], which are often played by the younger people as a form of friendship.<ref name=":11">{{Cite web |last=Welianto |first=Ari |editor-last=Welianto |editor-first=Ari |publisher=Kompas Cyber Media |date=7 February 2021 |title=Tari Yospan, Tarian Persahabatan Khas Papua Halaman all |url=https://www.kompas.com/skola/read/2021/02/07/173000169/tari-yospan-tarian-persahabatan-khas-papua|access-date=4 March 2021 |website=Kompas.com |language=id}}</ref> Initially, the ''Yospan'' dance originated from two dances called ''Yosim'' and ''Pancar'', which were eventually combined into one. Hence, ''Yospan'' is an acronym of ''Yosim'' and ''Pancar''.<ref name=":11" /> When performing the ''Yosim'' dance, which originated from [[Yapen]] and [[Waropen Regency|Waropen]], the dancers invited other residents to be immersed in the songs sung by a group of singers and music instrument holders. The musical instruments used are simple, which consists of [[ukulele]] and guitar, musical instruments that are not native to Papua. There is also a tool that functions as a bass with three ropes. The rope is usually made from rolled fibers, a type of [[pandanus]] leaf, which can be found in the forests of the coastal areas of Papua. A music instrument called ''Kalabasa'' is also played during the dance, it is made of dried [[Calabash]], then filled with beads or small stones that are played by simply shaking it.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nurhayati |first=Dewi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MG_-DwAAQBAJ&q=kalabasa+papua+musik&pg=PA28 |title=Mengenal Tarian dan Seni Papua |date=22 September 2020 |publisher=Alprin |isbn=978-623-263-222-6 |language=id}}</ref> The women dancers wear woven sarongs to cover their chests, decorative heads with flowers and bird feathers.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UvpyAAAAMAAJ |title=Monografi daerah Irian Jaya |date=1980 |publisher=Proyek Media Kebudayaan, Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan |language=id}}</ref> Meanwhile, the male dancers would usually wear shorts, open chest, head also decorated with bird feathers.

The ''Isosolo'' dance is a type of dance performed by the inhabitants who lives around [[Lake Sentani]] in [[Jayapura]]. The ''Isosolo'' dance is performed to symbolize the harmony between different tribes in Papua. The art of boat dancing is a tradition of the [[Indigenous people of New Guinea|Papuan people]], especially among the Sentani people, where the dance is performed from one village to another. According to the [[Sentani language]], ''Isosolo'' or ''Isolo'' dance is a traditional art of the Sentani people who dance on a boat on Lake Sentani. The word ''Isosolo'' consists of two words, ''iso'' and s''olo'' (or ''holo''). ''Iso'' means to rejoice and dance to express feelings of the heart, while ''holo'' means a group or herd from all age groups who dance. Hence, ''isosolo'' means a group of people who dance with joy to express their feelings.<ref name=":12">{{Cite web |date=1 January 2010 |title=Warisan Budaya Takbenda: Isolo |url=https://warisanbudaya.kemdikbud.go.id/?newdetail&detailCatat=853|access-date=4 March 2021 |website=warisanbudaya.kemdikbud.go.id |publisher=Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan}}</ref> The Isosolo dance in Sentani is usually performed by ''ondofolo'' (traditional leaders) and the village community to present a gift to other ''ondofolo''.

[[File:Papuan Dance from Yapen.jpg|left|thumb|Traditional Papuan war dance from the [[Yapen Islands Regency|Yapen Islands]]]]

Each Papuan tribe usually has their own [[war dance]].

Another traditional dance that is common to most if not all Papuan tribes is called ''musyoh''. The emergence of the ''musyoh'' dance is based on a certain history. In ancient times, when a Papuan tribe member died due to an accident or something unexpected, the Papuan people believed that the evil spirit (''[[Suanggi]]'') of the person who died was still roaming and unsettled. To overcome this, the Papuan tribesmen created a ritual in the form of the ''musyoh'' dance. Thus, this traditional dance is often referred to as a spirit exorcism dance. Generally, the ''musyoh'' dance is performed by men. However, besides the purpose of exorcising spirits, the ''musyoh'' dance is also used by the Papuan people for another purpose, such as welcoming guests. The ''musyoh'' dance is a symbol of respect, gratitude, and an expression of happiness in welcoming guests. If it is for the purpose of expelling the spirit, this ''musyoh'' dance is performed by men. In the case for welcoming guests, this dance is performed by men and women. The dancers wear simple costumes, consisting of head coverings, tops, and bottoms, made from processed tree bark and plant roots. These are then adorned with bracelets and necklaces and body paint on the dancers' bodies.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=25 August 2018 |title=Tari Musyoh – Tarian Pengusir Arwah oleh Masyarakat Papua |url=https://blogkulo.com/tari-musyoh-papua/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210122004321/https://blogkulo.com/tari-musyoh-papua/ |archive-date=22 January 2021 |access-date=4 March 2021 |website=Blog Kulo |language=id-ID}}</ref>

=== Architecture ===

The ''kariwari'' is one of the traditional Papuan houses, more precisely the traditional house of the Tobati-Enggros people who live around Yotefa Bay and [[Lake Sentani]] near [[Jayapura]].<ref name=":14">{{Cite journal |last=Fauziah |first=Nur |date=2014 |title=Karakteristik Arsitektur Tradisional Papua |url=https://publikasiilmiah.ums.ac.id/bitstream/handle/11617/5026/SNTT%20A-003%20Nur%20Fauziah%20UM%20Surabaya.pdf?sequence=1 |journal=Simposium Nasional Teknologi Terapan |volume=2 |pages=19–29 |issn=2339-028X}}</ref> Unlike other forms of Papuan traditional houses, such as the round ''[[honai]],'' the ''kariwari'' is usually constructed in the shape of an octagonal pyramid. ''Kariwari'' are usually made of, bamboo, iron wood and forest sago leaves. The Kariwari house consists of two floors and three rooms or three rooms, each with different functions. The ''kariwari'' is not like a ''honai'' that can be lived in by anyone, it cannot even be the residence of a tribal chief – unlike the ''honai'' which has political and legal functions. The ''kariwari'' is more specific as a place of education and worship, therefore the position of the ''Kariwari'' in the community of the Tobati-Enggros people is considered a sacred and holy place.<ref name=":14" /> Like traditional houses in general, the ''kariwari'' also has a design that is full of decorative details that make it unique, of course, the decorations are related to Papuan culture. especially from the Tobati-Enggros.

''Rumsram'' is the traditional house of the [[Biak Numfor Regency|Biak Numfor]] people on the northern coast of Papua. This house was originally intended for men, while women were prohibited from entering or approaching it. Its function is similar to the ''kariwari'', namely as a place for activities in teaching and educating men who are starting to be teenagers, in seeking life experiences. The building is square with a roof in the shape of an upside down boat because of the background of the Biak Numfor tribe who work as sailors. The materials used are bark for floors, split and chopped water bamboo for walls, while the roof is made of dried [[sago]] leaves. The walls are made of sago leaves. The original ''rumsram'' wall only had a few windows and its position was at the front and back. A ''rumsram'' usually has a height of approximately 6–8 m and is divided into two parts, differentiated by floor levels. The first floor is open and without walls. Only the building columns were visible. In this place, men are educated to learn sculpting, shielding, boat building, and war techniques. In a traditional ceremony called ''Wor Kapanaknik'', which in the [[Biak language]] means "to shave a child's hair", a traditional ritual is usually carried out when boys are 6–8 years old. The age when a child is considered to be able to think and the child has started to get education in the search for life experiences, as well as how to become a strong and responsible man as the head of the family later. The children would then enter a ''rumsram'', hence the [[rite of passage]] is also called ''rumsram,'' because the ritual are carried out in the ''rumsram''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tradisi Wor » Budaya Indonesia |url=https://budaya-indonesia.org/Tradisi-Wor/|access-date=4 March 2021 |website=budaya-indonesia.org}}</ref>
