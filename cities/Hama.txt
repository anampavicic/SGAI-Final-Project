'''Hama''' ({{langx|ar|حَمَاة}} ''{{transliteration|ar|DIN|Ḥamāh}}'', {{IPA|ar|ħaˈmaː|}}; {{langx|syr|ܚܡܳܬ|ħ(ə)mɑθ|lit=fortress}}; {{langx|hbo|חֲמָת|Ḥămāṯ}}) is a city on the banks of the [[Orontes River]] in west-central [[Syria]]. It is located {{convert|213|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Damascus]] and {{convert|46|km}} north of [[Homs]]. It is the provincial capital of the [[Hama Governorate]]. With a population of 996,000 (2023 census), Hama is the [[List of cities in Syria|fourth-largest city]] in Syria after [[Damascus]], [[Aleppo]] and [[Homs]].<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/your-cheat-sheet-to-the-syrian-conflict Updated: Your Cheat Sheet to the Syrian Conflict]. PBS.</ref><ref name="britannica">{{cite web|title=Hamah (Syria)|url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/253154/Hamah|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=3 June 2013}}</ref>

The city is renowned for [[Norias of Hama|its seventeen norias]] used for watering the gardens, which are locally claimed to date back to 1100 BC. Though historically used for purpose of [[irrigation]], the [[noria]]s exist today as an almost entirely aesthetic traditional show.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Hama}}
The ancient settlement of Hamath was occupied from the early [[Neolithic]] to the [[Iron Age]].

===Neolithic===
The stratigraphy is very generalized, which makes detailed comparison to other sites difficult. Level M ({{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} thick) contained both white ware (lime-plaster) and true pottery. It may be contemporary with [[Ugarit|Ras Shamra V]] (6000–5000 BC).

===Chalcolithic===
Remains from the [[Chalcolithic]] have been uncovered by Danish archaeologists on the mount on which the former citadel once stood.<ref name="Ring1">Ring, 1996, p.315.</ref> The excavation took place between 1931 and 1938 under the direction of Harald Ingholt. The overlying level L dates to the Chalcolithic [[Halaf culture]].

===Bronze Age===
====Mitanni period====
Although the town appears to be unmentioned in [[cuneiform]] sources before the first millennium BC,<ref name="Hawkins, J.D. 1975">Hawkins, J.D. "Hamath." ''Reallexikon der Assyriologie und Vorderasiatischen Archäologie'', Vol. 4. Walter de Gruyter, 1975.</ref> the site appears to have been prosperous around 1500&nbsp;BC, when it was presumably an [[Amorite]] dependency of [[Mitanni]], an empire along the [[Euphrates]] in northeastern Syria.<ref name="Ring1"/>

====Hittite period====
By around 1350 BC, Mitanni was overthrown by the [[Hittites]], who controlled all of northern Syria.

In the south, the Hittites were in conflict with the Egyptians. Hamath became an important urban center. The conflict culminated in the famous [[Battle of Kadesh]] against [[Ancient Egypt]] under [[Ramesses II]] near [[Homs]] in 1285&nbsp;BC.

In early 19th century, [[Johann Ludwig Burckhardt]] was the first to discover Hittite or [[Anatolian hieroglyphs|Luwian hieroglyphic]] script at Hama.<ref>[http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/hittite.htm The Decipherment of Hittite] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181031184739/http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/hittite.htm |date=31 October 2018 }} James Norman (Schmidt), Ancestral Voices: Decoding Ancient Languages, Four Winds Press, New York, 1975.</ref>

===Iron Age===
The Fall of the Hittite Empire saw the Neo-Hittite/[[Arameans|Aramaean]] Hama attested as the capital of one of the prosperous [[Syro-Hittite states]] known from the [[Hebrew Bible]] as Hamath ([[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]: ''Ḥmt''; [[Hittite language|Hittite]]: ''Amatuwana'';<ref name="Hawkins, J.D. 1975"/> {{langx|hbo|{{Script/Hebrew|חֲמָת}}|Ḥămāṯ}}), which traded extensively, particularly with Israel and Judah.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7125-hamath |encyclopedia=Jewish Encyclopedia |title=Hamath |publisher=Jewishencyclopedia.com |access-date=4 February 2013}}</ref>

====Assyrian inscriptions====
When the Assyrian king [[Shalmaneser III]] (858–824 BC) conquered the north of [[Aramea]], he reached Hamath (Assyrian: ''Amat'' or ''Hamata'')<ref name="Hawkins, J.D. 1975"/> in 853 BC; this marks the beginning of Assyrian inscriptions relating to the kingdom.<ref>Hamath's history from the inscriptions was encapsulated by George L. Robinson, "The Entrance of Hamath" ''The Biblical World'' '''32'''.1 (July 1908:7–18), in discussing the topography evoked by the Biblical phrase "the entrance of Hamath".<!--a better summary history could probably be cited--></ref> [[Irhuleni]] of Hamath and [[Hadadezer]] of [[Aram-Damascus]] (biblical "Bar-Hadad") led a coalition of [[Aramean]] cities against the encroaching Assyrian armies. According to Assyrian sources, they were confronted by 4,000 chariots, 2,000 horsemen, 62,000-foot-soldiers and 1,000 Arab camel-riders in the [[Battle of Qarqar]]. The attested win for the Assyrians seems to have actually been more of a draw, although Shalmaneser III continued on to the shore and even took a ship to open sea. In the following years, Shalmaneser III failed to conquer Hamath or Aram-Damascus. After the death of Shalmaneser III, the former allies Hamath and Aram-Damascus fell out, and Aram-Damascus seems to have taken over some of Hamath's territory.

An Aramaic inscription of [[Zakkur]], dual king of Hamath and [[Luhuti]], tells of an attack by a coalition including [[Sam'al]] under [[Ben-Hadad III]], son of [[Hazael]], king of Aram-Damascus. Zakir was besieged in his fortress of [[Tell Afis|Hazrak]], but saved by intervention of the God [[Baalshamin]]. Later on, the state of [[Sam'al]] came to rule both Hamath and Aram. {{Citation needed|reason=No historical evidence for this claim|date=December 2016}}

In 743 BC, [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] took a number of towns in the territory of Hamath, distributed the territories among his generals, and [[Population transfer|forcibly removed]] 1,223 selected inhabitants to the valley of the Upper [[Tigris]]; he exacted tribute from Hamath's king, Eni-Ilu (Eniel).

In 738 BC, Hamath is listed among the cities again conquered by Assyrian troops. Over 30,000 natives were deported to [[Ullaba]] (located in [[Urartu]]){{sfn|Grainger|2016|p=}} and replaced with captives from the [[Zagros Mountains]].<ref name="Hawkins, J.D. 1975"/>

====Destruction under Sargon II====
After the fall of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|northern kingdom of Israel]], Hamath's king [[Yahu-Bihdi|Ilu-Bi'di]] (Jau-Bi'di) led a failed revolt of the newly organized Assyrian provinces of [[Arpad, Syria|Arpad]], [[Simirra]], [[Damascus]], and [[Samarra|Samara]].

Styling himself the "Destroyer of Hamath," [[Sargon II]] razed the city c. 720 BC,<ref>"Hamath Wrecked to Terrify Small Opponents of Assyria" ''The Science News-Letter''. 39:13 (29 March 1941:205–206.)</ref> recolonized it with 6300 Assyrians and removed its king to be flayed alive in Assyria.<ref name="Hawkins, J.D. 1975"/> He also carried off to [[Nimrud]] the ivory-adorned furnishings of its kings.<ref>The ivories were found there by Layard. One of the ivory panels found at "Fort Shalmaneser" is inscribed "Hamath." (R. D. Barnett, "Hamath and Nimrud: Shell Fragments from Hamath and the Provenance of the Nimrud Ivories." ''Iraq''. 25:1. [Spring 1963:81–85.])</ref>

Displaced persons from Hamath subsequently comprised an important part of the multi-ethnic Aramaean community at [[Elephantine]] and Syene (now [[Aswan]]) in Egypt starting in 700 BCE, where alongside similarly displaced [[Jews]] they produced a large corpus of materials in [[Imperial Aramaic]] known as the [[Elephantine papyri and ostraca]].<ref name="Toorn2019">{{cite book | author = Karel van der Toorn | date = 24 September 2019 | title = Becoming Diaspora Jews: Behind the Story of Elephantine | publisher = Yale University Press | pages = 54–59 | isbn = 978-0-300-24949-1 | oclc = 1117508771 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mpKsDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA54|quote=In the fifth century BCE, the Persian army in southern Egypt employed Arameans from Syria, Arameans from Babylonia, and Jews. The latter identified themselves as Arameans too. Their language was Aramaic, and their literary and religious culture bore an Aramean slant. [...] One of the two groups that constituted the Aramean colony of Syene had its roots in Hamath. This is the Bethel group.}}</ref>

===={{anchor|Hamath in the Bible}}Hamath in the Bible====
The few [[Bible|Biblical]] reports state that Hamath was the capital of a [[Canaan]]ite kingdom ({{bibleverse|Genesis|10:18}}; {{bibleverse|2 Kings 23:33; 25:21|multi=yes}}), whose king congratulated [[King David]] on his defeat of [[Hadadezer bar Rehob|Hadadezer]], king of [[Zobah]] ({{bibleverse|2 Samuel|8:9-11}}; {{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|18:9-11}}). In God's instructions to [[Moses]], Hamath is specified as part of the northern border of the land that will fall to the children of Israel as an inheritance when they enter the land of Canaan ({{bibleverse|Numbers|34.1–9}}). [[Solomon]], it would seem, took possession of Hamath and its territory and built store cities ({{bibleverse|1 Kings|4:21–24}}; {{bibleverse|2 Chronicles|8:4}}). {{bibleverse|1 Kings|8:65}} names the "entrance of Hamath", or [[Lebo-hamath|Lebo-Hamath]], as the northern border of Israel at the time of the dedication of the [[Solomon's Temple|first temple]] in [[Jerusalem]]. The area was subsequently lost to the Syrians, but [[Jeroboam II]], king of [[Northern Kingdom of Israel|Israel]], is said to have "restored the territory of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the Sea of the [[Arabah]] (the [[Dead Sea]])".<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Kings|14:25|NKJV}}: [[NKJV]] translation; cf. [[NIV]] translation, which refers to the Dead Sea</ref>

Assyria's defeat of Hamath made a profound impression on [[Isaiah]] ({{bibleverse|Isaiah|10:9}}). The prophet [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] also named the town "Hamath the Great" ({{bibleverse|Amos|6:2}}).

===Persian, Hellenistic and Roman history===

In 539 BC, [[Cyrus the Great]], King of [[Achaemenid Empire]], took Syria as part of his empire, to be known as [[Eber-Nari]]. In July 522 BC, [[Cambyses II]] died at a location called Agbatana, which is most likely the modern city of Hama.{{sfn|Dandamayev|1990|pp=726–729}}

In the second half of the 4th century BC the modern region of Syria came under the influence of Greco-Roman culture, following long lasting semitic and Persian cultures. [[Alexander the Great]]'s campaign from 334 to 323 BC brought Syria under [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenic]] rule. Since the country lay on the trade routes from Asia to Greece, Hama and many other Syrian cities again grew rich through trade. After the death of Alexander the Great his Near East conquests were divided between his generals, and [[Seleucus Nicator]] became ruler of Syria and the founder of the [[Seleucid dynasty]]. Under the Seleucids there was a revival in the fortunes of Hama. The Aramaeans were allowed to return to the city, which was renamed '''Epiphaneia'''<ref name="Hawkins, J.D. 1975"/> ({{langx|grc|Ἐπιφάνεια}}),<ref name="Stephanus of Byzantium">{{Cite web|url=https://topostext.org/work/241#E274.17|title=ToposText|website=topostext.org}}</ref> after the Seleucid Emperor [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]]. Seleucid rule began to decline, however, in the next two centuries, and Arab dynasties began to gain control of cities in this part of Syria, including Hama.<ref name="Ring2"/>

The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] took over original settlements such as ''Hama'' and made them their own. They met little resistance when they invaded Syria under [[Pompey]] and annexed it in 64 BC, whereupon Hama became part of the [[Syria (Roman province)|Roman province of Syria]], ruled from Rome by a proconsul. Hama was an important city during the Greek and Roman periods, but very little archaeological evidence remains.<ref name="Ring2"/> As Syria became part of the Roman Empire, five hundred Hamian archers, known as "''Cohors Prima Hamiorum Sagittaria''", were stationed at [[Magnis (Carvoran)|Magnis]] on [[Hadrian's Wall]] in northern [[Roman Britain|Britain]] starting from AD 120. The same unit or another one was later renamed to "''Numerus Syrorum Saggitariorum''" and located at [[Derventio Brigantum]] ([[Malton, North Yorkshire|Malton]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.portalstothepast.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Roman-Hamian-Archer.pdf |title=Hamian Archers: Roman auxiliaries from Syria in Britain. 2nd Century A.D. |website=portalstothepast.co.uk }}</ref> The garrison unit was transferred to [[Bar Hill Fort]] on the [[Antonine Wall]] in [[Scotland]] in AD 142–157, then back to Magnis in AD 163–166, during the early reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]]. They might have also stationed at [[Housesteads Roman Fort|Housesteads]], as a tombstone of an archer was located there. However, the cohort's presence in Britain was proven by military diplomas, found in [[Stannington, Northumberland|Stannington]] (AD 122) and [[Ravenglass]] (AD 124), in addition to altars dedicated to Syrian Goddesses discovered at [[Catterick, North Yorkshire|Catterick]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.romanarmy.net/images/Pages/Military/hamians.htm |title=The Hamians |website=romanarmy.net }}</ref>{{sfn|Bruce|1867|pp=243–244}}

In AD 330, the capital of the Roman Empire was moved to [[Byzantium]], and the city continued to prosper. In [[Byzantine]] days, Hama was known as '''Emath''' or '''Emathoùs''' (''Εμαθούς'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]). Roman rule from Byzantium meant the [[Christian religion]] was strengthened throughout the Near East, and churches were built in Hama and other cities. The Byzantine historian [[John of Epiphania]] was born in Hama in the 6th century.<ref name="Ring2"/>
[[File:Alley in Hama.jpg|left|thumb|An alley in old Hama]]

Two main personalities from Hama were documented during Greek-Roman times. The first is Eustathius of Epiphaneia ({{langx|grc|Εὐστάθιος Ἐπιφανεύς}}), who was a Greek historian but all his works were lost. His most famous work was the "Brief Chronicle" ({{langx|grc|Χρονικὴν ἐπιτομὴν}}).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/sol/sol-entries/epsilon/3746|title=SOL Search|website=www.cs.uky.edu}}</ref> The second personality is [[Euphrates the Stoic]], who was from Epiphaneia according to [[Stephanus of Byzantium]].<ref name="Stephanus of Byzantium"/>

===Muslim rule===
[[File:Nur al-Din Mosque, Hama 01.jpg|thumb|[[Nur al-Din Mosque]]]]
During the [[Muslim conquest of Syria]] in the 7th century, Hama was conquered by [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah]] in 638 or 639 and the town regained its ancient name, and has since retained it. Following its capture, it came under the administration of [[Jund Hims]] and remained so throughout the rule of [[Umayyad dynasty|Umayyad]]s until the 9th century.<ref name="DSA163">Dumper, Stanley, and Abu-Lughod, 2007, p.163.</ref>

[[Arab]] geographer [[al-Muqaddasi]] writes Hama became a part of [[Jund Qinnasrin]] during [[Abbasid]] rule.<ref>le Strange, 1890, p.39.</ref> Although the city's history is obscure at this time period, it is known that Hama was a walled market town with a ring of outlying cities. On 29 November 903, the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] during the reign of [[Al-Muktafi]] defeated the [[Qarmatians]] in the [[Battle of Hama]], which eliminated them from the western [[Syrian Desert]].

It came under the control of the [[Hamdanid]] rulers of [[Aleppo]] in the 10th century and was consequently drawn into the orbit of that city where it remained until the 12th century.<ref name="DSA163"/> These were considered the "dark years" of Hama as the local rulers of northern and southern Syria struggled for dominance in the region. The Byzantines under emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nicephorus Phocas]] raided the town in 968 and burned the [[Great Mosque of Hama|Great Mosque]]. By the 11th century, the [[Fatimid]]s gained suzerainty over northern Syria and during this period, the [[Mirdasid]]s sacked Hama.<ref name="DSA163"/> [[Persian people|Persian]] geographer [[Nasir Khusraw]] noted in 1047 that Hama was "well populated" and stood on the banks of the Orontes River.<ref>le Strange, 1890, p.357.</ref>

[[File:Hama, Life on the streets, Syria.jpg|thumb|The gate in the old city of Hama, Mamluk architecture]]
[[Tancred, Prince of Galilee]], took it in 1108,<ref name="britannica"/> but in 1114 the [[Crusaders]] lost it definitively to the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]]s,{{sfn|Whitaker|2008|p=163}} during the reign of [[Toghtekin]], atabeg of Damascus. In [[1157 Hama earthquake|1157 an earthquake]] shattered the city.<ref>Robinson 1908:9.</ref> For the next sixty years, Hama was battled for by competing rulers. [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur al-Din]], the [[Zengid]] sultan, erected a [[Nur al-Din Mosque|mosque]] with a tall, square [[minaret]] in the city in 1172.<ref>[http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=7506 Nur al-Din Mosque] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703000453/http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=7506 |date=3 July 2013 }}. Archnet Digital Library.</ref> In 1175, Hama was taken from the Zengids by [[Saladin]]. He granted the city to his nephew, [[al-Muzaffar Umar]], four years later, putting it under the rule of his [[Ayyubid]] family. This ushered in an era of stability and prosperity in Hama as the Ayyubids ruled it almost continuously until 1342.<ref name="DSA163"/> Geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]], who was born in Hama, described it in 1225 as a large town surrounded by a strongly built wall.<ref>le Strange, 1890, p.359.</ref> Hama was sacked by the [[Mongol invasion of Syria|Mongols]] in 1260, as were most other Syrian cities, but the Mongols were [[Battle of Marj al-Saffar (1303)|defeated]] that same year and then again in 1303 by the [[Mamluks]] who succeeded the Ayyubids as rulers of the region.<ref name="Ring2">Ring, 1996, p.317.</ref> Hama briefly passed to Mamluk control in 1299 after the death of governor al-Mansur Mahmoud II. However, unlike other former Ayyubid cities, the Mamluks reinstated Ayyubid rule in Hama by making [[Abu al-Fida]], the historian and geographer, governor of the city and he reigned from 1310 to 1332.<ref name="DSA163"/> He described his city as "very ancient... mentioned in the book of the [[Israelite]]s. It is one of the pleasantest places in Syria."<ref name="Strange360"/> After his death, he was succeeded by his son [[al-Afdal Muhammad]] who eventually lost Mamluk favor and was deposed. Thus, Hama came under direct Mamluk control.<ref name="DSA163"/>

Hama grew prosperous during the Ayyubid period, as well as the Mamluk period. It gradually expanded to both banks of the Orontes River, with the suburb on the right bank being connected to the town proper by a newly built bridge. The town on the left bank was divided into upper and lower parts, each of which was surrounded by a wall. The city was filled with palaces, markets, mosques, ''[[madrasa]]s'', and a hospital, and over thirty different sized [[noria]]s (water-wheels). In addition, there stood a massive citadel in Hama.<ref name="DSA163"/> Moreover, a special aqueduct brought drinking water to Hama from the neighboring town of [[Salamiyah]].<ref name="DSA163"/>

[[Ibn Battuta]] visited Hama in 1335 and remarked that the Orontes River made the city "pleasant to live in, with its many gardens full of trees and fruits." He also speaks of a large suburb called al-Mansuriyyah (named after an Ayyubid emir) that contained "a fine market, a mosque, and bathes."<ref name="Strange360">le Strange, 1890, p.360.</ref> In 1400, [[Timurlane]] took Hama, along with nearby [[Homs]] and [[Baalbek]].<ref>le Strange, 1890, p.xxiii.</ref>

===Ottoman rule===
[[File:AlAzamPalace at Hama1.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Azm Palace (Hama)|Azem Palace]] in Hama was built in 1742]]
The prosperous period of Mamluk rule came to an end in 1516, when the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] conquered Syria from the Mamluks after defeating them at the [[Battle of Marj Dabiq]] near Aleppo. Hama, and the rest of Syria, came under Ottoman rule from [[Constantinople]].<ref name="Ring3">Ring, 1996, p.318.</ref> Under the Ottomans, Hama gradually became more important in the administrative structure of the region. It was first made capital of one of the ''[[Liwa (Arabic)|liwa]]s'' ("districts") of the ''[[eyalet]]'' ("province") of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]].<ref name="DSA163"/> Hama once again became an important center for trade routes running east from the [[Mediterranean]] coast into Asia.

Then in the 18th century, it became a part of the holdings of the governor of Damascus.<ref name="DSA163"/> The governors of Damascus at this time were the Azems, who also ruled other parts of Syria, for the Ottomans. They erected sumptuous residences in Hama, including the [[Azm Palace (Hama)|Azem Palace]] and Khan As'ad Pasha which were built by [[As'ad Pasha al-Azm|As'ad Pasha al-Azem]], who governed Hama for a number of years until 1742.<ref name="Ring3"/> By then, there were 14 caravansaries in the city, mostly used for the storage and distribution of seeds, cotton, wool, and other commodities.<ref>Reilly, 2002, p.72.</ref> After the passing of the Vilayet Law in 1864, Hama became the capital of the Sanjak of Hama (gaining the city more administrative powers), part of the larger [[vilayet of Sham]].<ref name="DSA163"/>

===Modern history===
[[File:Hama, Syria.jpg|thumb|left|General view]]
[[File:Clock tower of Hama.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[clock tower]] of Hama]]

Ottoman rule ended in 1918, after their defeat in [[World War I]] to the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Forces]]. Hama was made part of the [[French Mandate of Syria]]. By then, Hama had developed into what it has remained: a medium-sized provincial town, important as the market for an agricultural area abundant in cereals, but also cotton and sugar beets. It gained notoriety as the center of large estates worked by peasants and dominated by a few magnate families. The [[1925 Hama uprising]] occurred in the city during the [[Great Syrian Revolt]] against the French.

During the French Mandate, the district of Hama contained within its bounds the municipality of Hama and 114 villages. By an estimate in 1930, only four of these villages were owned outright by local cultivators, while sharing ownership of two villages with a notable family. Thus, the hinterland was owned by landowning elites.<ref name="DSA164">Dumper, Stanley, and Abu-Lughod, 2007, p. 164.</ref> Starting in the late 1940s, significant class conflict erupted as agricultural workers sought reform in Hama.

Syria gained full independence from France in 1946. [[Akram al-Hawrani]], a member of an impoverished notable family in Hama, began to agitate for land reform and better social conditions. He made Hama the base of his [[Arab Socialist Party]], which later merged with another socialist party, the [[Ba'ath Party|Ba'ath]]. This party's ascent to power in 1963 signalled the end of power for the landowning elite.

The political insurgency by Sunni Islamic groups, particularly the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], occurred in the city, which was reputed as a stronghold of conservative Sunni Islam. As early as the spring of 1964, Hama became the epicentre of an [[1964 Hama riot|uprising]] by conservative forces, encouraged by speeches from mosque preachers, denouncing the policies of the Ba'ath. The Syrian government sent tanks and troops into the quarters of Hama's old city to put down the insurrection.<ref name="DSA164"/>

In the early 1980s, Hama had emerged as a major source of opposition to the Ba'ath government during the Sunni armed [[Islamic uprising in Syria|Islamist uprising]], which had begun in 1976. The city was a focal point for bloody events in the [[April 1981 Hama massacre|1981 massacre]] and the most notable [[1982 Hama massacre]].<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Larbi Sadiki]] |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/07/201173113293285318.html |title=In Syria, the government is the real rebel – Opinion |publisher=Al Jazeera English |access-date=31 July 2011}}</ref> The most serious insurrection of the Syrian Islamist uprising happened in Hama during February 1982, when Government forces, led by the president's brother, [[Rifaat al-Assad]], quelled the revolt in Hama with very harsh means.<ref>[http://bikyamasr.com/wordpress/?p=38546]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref> Tanks and artillery shelled the neighbourhoods held by the insurgents indiscriminately, and government forces are alleged to have executed thousands of prisoners and civilian residents after subduing the revolt, which became known as the Hama massacre.

As a result, the city has a much hotter and drier climate than nearby [[Homs]].

==Demographics==
[[File:Hama-RomanOrthodoxChurch.jpg|thumb|A [[Greek Orthodox]] church.]]

According to Josiah C. Russel, during the 12th century, Hama had a population of 6,750.<ref>Shatzmiller, 1994, p.59.</ref> James Reilly accounts the historical population as: 1812– 30,000 (Burckhardt) 1830– 20,000 (Robinson) 1839– 30–44,000 (Bowring) 1850– 30,000 (Porter) 1862– 10–12,000 (Guys) 1880– 27,656 (Parliamentary Papers) 1901– 60,000 (Parliamentary Papers) 1902–1907 80,000 (Trade Reports) 1906– 40,000 (al-Sabuni) 1909– 60,000 (Trade Reports)<ref>James Reilly,  ''A Small Town in Syria, Ottoman Hama in the 18th and 19th Centuries'', p73. Peter Lang Publishing (2002)</ref>
In 1932, while Hama was under the French Mandate, there were approximately 50,000 residents. In the 1960 census, there were 110,000 inhabitants. The population continued to rise, reaching 180,000 in 1978 and 273,000 in 1994.<ref>Wincler, 1998, p.72.</ref> The infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births in the [[Hama Governorate]] was 99.4.<ref>Wincler, 1998, p.44.</ref> A 2005 estimate had Hama's population at around 325,000 inhabitants.<ref name="DSA162"/>

Most of the residents are [[Sunni Muslim]]s (including mostly [[Arabs]], [[Kurds in Syria|Kurds]], and [[Syrian Turkmen|Turkmen]]), although some districts of the city are exclusively Christian.<ref name="DSA162">Dumper, Stanley, and Abu-Lughod, 2007, p.162.</ref> Hama is reputed to be the most conservative Sunni Muslim city in Syria since French Mandate times. During that period there was an old saying reflecting this characteristic: "In Damascus, it takes only three men to make a political demonstration, while in Hama it takes only three men to get the town to pray."<ref name="DSA164"/> The Christian population mostly adheres to the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] or the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]].<ref name="SandH232"/>

The city also contains a [[Palestinian refugee camp]], known as [[Hama camp]].

===Ecclesiastical status===
The Greek Orthodox Church has a prelacy in Hama under the [[Patriarch of Antioch]].<ref name="SandH232">Schaff and Herzog, 1911, p.232.</ref> Hama is still a Roman Catholic [[titular see]] (referred to as "Hamath" or Amath"), [[suffragan]] of [[Apamea (Syria)|Apamea]]. It is as "Epiphania" that it is best known in ecclesiastical documents. [[Lequien]] mentions nine Greek bishops of Epiphania.<ref>''Oriens Christianus'', II, pp.915–918.</ref> The first of them, whom he calls Mauritius, is the Manikeios whose signature appears in the [[First Council of Nicaea]].<ref>[[Heinrich Gelzer|Gelzer, Heinrich]], ''Patrum Nicaenorum Nomina''. p.lxi.</ref> Currently, it has two Catholic archbishops, a [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Greek Melkite]] and a Syrian, the former residing at [[Labroud]], the latter at Homs, reuniting the titles of [[Homs|Homs (Emesus)]] and Hamah.<ref>''Missiones Catholicae''. pp.781–804.</ref>

Hama's most famous attractions are the 17 [[Norias of Hama]] ({{langx|ar|نواعير حماة}}), dating back to the [[Byzantine]] times. Fed by the [[Orontes river]], they are up to {{convert|20|m}} in diameter. The largest ''noria''s are the ''al-Mamunye'' (1453) and the ''al-Muhammediye'' (14th century). Originally they were used to route water into aqueducts, which led into the town and the neighbouring agricultural areas.

''Other sights include:''
*the museum, housed in an 18th-century Ottoman governor residence (''Azem'' Palace). Remains in the exhibition include a precious Roman mosaic from the nearby village of [[Maryamin, Homs|Maryamin]] (4th century AD)
*''[[Nur Al-Din Mosque|al-Nuri]]'' mosque, finished in 1163 by [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]] after the [[1157 Hama earthquake|earthquake of 1157]]. Notable is the minaret.
*The small Mamluk ''al-Izzi'' mosque (15th century)
*The mosque and Mausoleum of [[Abu al-Fida]], a celebrated [[Ayyubid]] historian who was also governor of the city.
*''al-Hasanain'' mosque, also rebuilt by Nur ad-Din after the aforementioned earthquake.
*The [[Great Mosque of Hama|Great Mosque]]. Destroyed in the 1982 bombardment, it has been rebuilt in its original forms. It has elements dating from the ancient and Christian structures existing in the same location. It has two minarets, and is preceded by a portico with an elevated treasury.
