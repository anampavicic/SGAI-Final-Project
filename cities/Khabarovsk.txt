==History==
[[File:Kitchen-21-Russia-mid-Amur-2830.jpg|thumb|Native villages near the site of the future Khabarovsk according to an English map of 1773. The village closest to today's Khabarovsk is labeled "Hitcha". Maack's "Cape Kyrma" site (thought by B.P. Polyakov to be the site of Stepanov's Kosogorsky Ostrog) is "Heremo"]]

===Earliest record===
Historical records indicate that a city was founded on the site in the eighth century. The [[Tungusic peoples]] are indigenous to the city's vicinity. The city was named {{lang|zh-Latn|Boli}} ({{lang-zh|t=[[wikt:伯力|伯力]]|p=Bólì|labels=no}}) in Chinese when it was part of the Chinese empire. During the Tang dynasty, Boli was the capital of Heishui Protectorate, called Heishui Duhufu.
<ref>hellotravel, https://www.hellotravel.com/russia/khabarovsk</ref> In AD 722, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] (唐玄宗) established Heishui Protectorate and gave self-rule to [[Heishui Mohe]] tribes. The seat of this administrative region was then established near today's Khabarovsk.<ref>《新唐書·北狄傳》記載：「黑水西北又有思慕部，益北行十日得郡利部，東北行十日得窟說部，亦號屈設，稍東南行十日得莫曳皆部。」。(The "New Tang Dynasty Book of Beidi" records: "There is also a tribe called "Dream Tribe" in the northwest of Heishui, Yibei travels on the 10th days to the "County Tribe", and the northeast travels on the 10th days to the "Cave Tribe". 10th days to the "Mo Mo Tribe")</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6704AAAAIAAJ&dq=editions:LCCN90172212 |title=黑龙江古代道路交通史 |date=1988 |publisher=人民交通出版社出版, 发行 |isbn=978-7-114-00315-8 |language=zh}}</ref>

===17th-century Russian exploration===
In the mid-17th century, the Amur Valley became the scene of [[Russian-Manchu border conflicts|hostilities]] between the [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian]] [[Cossacks]], who tried to expand into the region and collect tribute from the natives, and the rising [[Manchu people|Manchu]] [[Qing dynasty]], who were intent on securing the region for themselves.{{Citation needed|date=January 2024}} The coastal areas had historically been the native home of the Manchu people. 

====Khabarov's Achansk====
[[File:Ерофей Хабаров 2.jpg|thumb|Monument to [[Yerofey Khabarov]] in Khabarovsk.]]

The Russian explorers and raiders of the 1650s set up a number of more or less fortified camps (''[[ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]]s'') on the Amur. Most of them were in use for only a few months and later destroyed. It is usually thought that the first such camp in the general area of today's Khabarovsk was the fortified winter camp named Achansk ({{lang|ru|Ачанск}}) or Achansky gorodok ({{lang|ru|Ачанский городок}}), built by the Cossacks of [[Yerofey Khabarov]] in September 1651 after they had sailed to the area from the upper Amur. The fort was named after the local tribe whom Khabarov's people called "Achans".<ref>[http://www.inauka.ru/discovery/article35236.html Археологи обнаружили на Амуре таинственный городок.

(This article also contains references to Polevoy's earlier publications) {{in lang|ru}}</ref>), while many Russians were away fishing.<ref name=gai/> In late November, Khabarov's people undertook a three-day campaign against the local chief Zhakshur (Жакшур) (whose name is also known in a more Russian version, Zaksor (Заксор)), collecting a large amount of tribute and announcing that the locals were now subjects of the Russian Czar. A similar campaign was waged later in winter against the Ducher chief Nechiga (Нечига), farther away from Achansk.<ref name=gai/>

On 24 or&nbsp;26 March 1652, Fort Achansk was attacked by [[Manchu people|Manchu]] cavalry, led by [[Ninguta]]'s commander Haise, reinforced by Ducher auxiliaries, but the Cossacks stood their ground in a day-long battle and even managed to seize the attackers' [[Medieval warfare#Supply trains|supply train]].<ref name=gai/> Once the ice on the Amur broke in the spring of 1652, Khabarov's people destroyed their fort and sailed away.<ref name=gai/>

The exact location of Khabarov's Achansk has long been a subject for debate among Russian historians and geographers.<ref name=izvet/><ref name="koso">Б.П. Полевой (B.P. Polevoy) [http://ostrog.ucoz.ru/publikacii_2/4_53.htm О подлинном местоположении Косогорского острога 50-х гг. XVII века] (About the true location of the Kosogorsky ''Ostrog'' of the 1650s) {{in lang|ru}}</ref> A number of locations, both upstream and downstream of today's Khabarovsk, have been proposed since [[Richard Maack]], one of the first Russian scholars to visit the region, identified Achansk in 1859 with the ruins on Cape Kyrma, which is located on the southern (Chinese) shore of the Amur, upstream of Khabarovsk.<ref name=izvet/> The most widely accepted point of view is probably that of [[Boris Petrovich Polevoy|Boris Polevoy]], who believed that Khabarov's Achansk was located in the [[Nani people|Nanai]] village later known as Odzhal-[[Lake Bolon|Bolon]] ({{langx|ru|Оджал-Болонь}}), located on the left bank of the Amur, closer to [[Amursk]] than to Khabarovsk. One of his arguments was that both Khabarov's Achan (sometimes also spelt by the explorer as Otshchan, Отщан), and Wuzhala (乌扎拉) of the Chinese records of the 1652 engagement are based on the name of the [[Nanais|Nanai]] clan "Odzhal" (Оджал), corresponding to the 20th-century name of the village as well. (The name of the clan was also written as "Uzala", as in the name of its best-known member, [[Dersu Uzala]]).<ref name=izvet/>

Polevoy's view appeared to gain wide support among the Russian geographer community; petitioned by the Amur Branch of the [[Russian Geographical Society]], the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Government]] renamed the village of Odzhal to Achan in 1977, to celebrate its connection with Khabarov's raid.<ref name=izvet/>

As to the Cape Kyrma ruins, thought by Maack to be the remains of Achansk, B.P. Polevoy identified them as the remains of another ''ostrog'' – namely, Kosogorsky Ostrog, where [[Onufriy Stepanov]] stayed a few years later.<ref name=koso/>

===Qing Empire===
After the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] (1689) between the [[Tsardom of Russia]] and the  [[Qing Empire]], the area became an uncontested part of China for the next century and a half. Modern historical maps of the Qing period published in China mark the site of future Khabarovsk as Bólì ({{zh|s=伯力}}). All of the middle and lower Amur region was nominally part of the [[Jilin]] Province, run first out of [[Ninguta]] and later out of [[Jilin City]].<ref name="tang-prize.org">{{Cite web |title=Tang Prize {{!}} Laureates {{!}} Yoshinobu Shiba |url=http://www.tang-prize.org/owner_detail.php?id=922&cat=12 |access-date=2024-01-12 |website=www.tang-prize.org |language=en}}</ref>

French [[Jesuit missions in China|Jesuit]]s who sailed along the [[Ussuri]] and the [[Amur River|Amur]] Rivers in 1709 prepared the first more or less precise map of the region. According to them, the indigenous [[Nanai people]] were living on the Ussuri and on the Amur down to the mouth of the [[Anyuy River (Khabarovsk Krai)|Dondon River]] (i.e., in the region including the site of the future Khabarovsk). These people were known to the Chinese as ''Yupi Dazi'' ("Fish skin Tartars").<ref name="halde7">{{Cite book |last=Du Halde |first=Jean-Baptiste |url=http://web2.bium.univ-paris5.fr/livanc/?cote=00992x04&do=chapitre |title=Description géographique, historique, chronologique, politique et physique de l'empire de la Chine et de la Tartarie chinoise |publisher=P.G.

===From Khabarovka to Khabarovsk===
[[File:Khabarovsk - residence of the governor-general of Eastern Siberia LCCN2004708062.jpg|thumb|right|Khabarovsk – residence of the governor-general of Amur region 1895]]

In 1858, the area was ceded to Russia under the [[Treaty of Aigun]]. The Russians founded the military outpost of '''Khabarovka''' ({{lang|ru|Хаба́ровка}}),<ref>{{cite web |last1=Campbell |first1=Heather |title=Khabarovsk |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Khabarovsk-Russia |website=britannica.com |publisher=The Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=6 October 2022}}</ref> named after [[Yerofey Khabarov]]. The post later became an important industrial center for the region. Town status was granted in 1880. In 1893, it was given its present name: '''Khabarovsk'''.<ref name="gr">{{Cite book |title=Энциклопедия Города России |publisher=Большая Российская Энциклопедия |year=2003 |isbn=5-7107-7399-9 |location=Moscow |page=503}}</ref>

In 1894, a department of the [[Russian Geographical Society]] was formed in Khabarovsk and to found libraries, theatres and museums in the city. Since then, Khabarovsk's cultural life has flourished. Much of the local indigenous history has been well preserved in the Regional Lore Museum and Natural History Museum and in places like near the [[Nanai people|Nanai]] settlement of [[Sikachi-Alyan]], where cliff drawings from more than 13,000 years ago can be found. The Khabarovsk Art Museum exhibits a rare collection of old Russian icons.<ref name="tang-prize.org"/>

In 1916, the [[Khabarovsk Bridge]] across the Amur was completed, allowing [[Trans-Siberian Railway|Trans-Siberian]] trains to cross the river without using [[train ferry|ferries]] (or temporary rail tracks over the frozen river in winter). During the [[Russian Civil War]], Khabarovsk was occupied by [[Japan]] in September 1918.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/92943882?searchTerm=Kharbarovsk|title=Campaign in Far East: Japanese Occupy Kharbarovsk|newspaper=[[The Northern Star]]|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=September 9, 1918|access-date=23 February 2021|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

===Soviet era===
[[File:Txu-oclc-6614368-nm53-11a.jpg|thumb|Khabarovsk (1950)]]
After the defeat of Japan in [[World War II]],  Khabarovsk was the site of the [[Khabarovsk War Crime Trials]], in which twelve former members of the Japanese [[Kwantung Army]] and [[Unit 731]] were put on [[trial (law)|trial]] for the manufacture and use of [[biological weapons]] during World War II.<ref name="tang-prize.org"/>

Chinese Emperor [[Puyi]], captured by Soviet troops in [[Manchuria]], was relocated to Khabarovsk and lived there from 1945 up to 1950, when he was returned to China.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Working |first=Russell |date=6 May 2001 |title=His last translator |url=https://khv9923.narod.ru/His_last_translator.pdf |work=South China Morning Post}}</ref>

On 5 November 1956, the first phase of the city [[tram]] was commissioned. The Khabarovsk television studio began broadcasting in 1960. On 1 September 1967, the Khabarovsk Institute of Physical Education, now the [[Far Eastern State Academy of Physical Culture]], opened. On 14 January 1971, Khabarovsk was awarded the [[Order of October Revolution]]. In 1975 the first stage of the urban [[Tram|trolley]] opened. In 1976 the city hosted an international ice hockey tournament with the ball for the prize of the newspaper ''[[Sovietskaya Rossia]]''. In 1981 the [[Bandy World Championship 1981|Bandy World Championship]] was played in the city.<ref name="tang-prize.org"/>

===Russian Federation===
In 1996, Khabarovsk held its first [[Elections in Russia|mayoral elections]]. Paul D. Filippov, whose candidacy was supported by Governor [[Viktor Ishayev]], was defeated. In 1998, reconstruction of the [[Lenin Square, Khabarovsk|central square]] of Khabarovsk was completed. In May 2000, [[President of Russia]], [[Vladimir Putin]], decreed that new federal districts be formed, and Khabarovsk became the center of the [[Far Eastern Federal District]].<ref name="tang-prize.org"/>

In 2006, the Center for Cardiovascular Surgery, a high-tech medical center, was constructed according to a Russian [[National Priority Projects|national health project]]. In 2008, the train station was completely renovated, and the adjacent square was reconstructed to include fountains and an underground passage. In 2009, Khabarovsk hosted the [[Russia–European Union relations|EU-Russia summit]]. In 2010, the city hosted a meeting of the Great Circle of Ussuri [[Cossacks]].

A key street in Khabarovsk is the broad [[Amursky Boulevard]] with its many shops and a local market. The city's five districts stretch for {{convert|45|km|sp=us}} along the Amur River. The similar boulevard – Ussuryisky is located between the two main streets Muravyov-Amursky and Lenin street and runs to the city's artificial lakes (Gorodskie Prudi) with the sport complex Platinum Arena. The lakes are famous for their fountains with the light show. The [[Military History Museum of the Far Eastern Military District]] is located in the city, the only such museum in the Russian Far East.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kokurin |first=Boris |date=25 February 2014 |title=Военный музей в Хабаровске готовится к открытию |url=https://www.hab.kp.ru/daily/26199.2/3085703/ |access-date=1 November 2017 |website=[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]}}</ref>
