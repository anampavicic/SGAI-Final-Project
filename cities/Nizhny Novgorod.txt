In 1612, [[Kuzma Minin]] and Prince [[Dmitry Pozharsky]] organized an army for the liberation of [[Moscow]] and all [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]] from the [[Polish–Muscovite War (1605–1618)|Poles and Lithuanians]]. In 1817, Nizhny Novgorod became a [[Nizhny Novgorod Fair|great trade centre]] of the [[Russian Empire]]. In 1896, at a [[Nizhny Novgorod Fair|fair]], an [[All-Russia Exhibition 1896|All-Russia Exhibition]] was organized. During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet period]], the city turned into an important industrial centre, and was known as Gorky. In particular, the [[GAZ|Gorky Automobile Plant]] was constructed in this period. Around this time, the city was given the nickname "Russian [[Detroit]]". Shortly before the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] the city was renamed Nizhny Novgorod once again. In 1985, the [[Nizhny Novgorod Metro]] was opened. In 2016, [[Vladimir Putin]] opened the new [[Nizhny Novgorod Machine-building Plant|70th Anniversary of Victory Plant]], which is part of the [[Almaz-Antey]] Air and Space Defence Corporation.

The [[Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin|Kremlin]] – the [[Historic centre of Nizhny Novgorod|historic centre]] of the city – contains the main government agencies of the city and the Volga Federal District. The [[demonym]] for a Nizhny Novgorod resident is “нижегородец” (''nizhegorodets'') for male or “нижегородка” (''nizhegorodka'') for female, rendered in English as ''Nizhegorodian''. ''Novgorodian'' is improper; it refers to a resident of [[Veliky Novgorod]]. Nizhny Novgorod was one of the host cities of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of Nizhny Novgorod|Timeline of Nizhny Novgorod}}

=== Name ===
Originally the name was just Novgorod (“Newtown"), but to distinguish it from the other, older and well-known [[Veliky Novgorod|Novgorod]] (Veliky Novgorod) to the west, the city was commonly called “Novgorod of the Lower lands," or “Lower Newtown.” This land was named “lower” ([[:wikt:нижний|''nizhniy'' (нижний)]]), even though it is actually higher in altitude than Veliky Novgorod, because it is situated downstream of other Russian cities such as Moscow, [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] and [[Murom]].

It was known from 1932 to 1990 as '''Gorky''' ({{lang|ru|Горький}}, {{IPA|ru|ˈɡorʲkʲɪj|}}).

=== Seat of medieval princes ===
{{Main|Principality of Nizhny Novgorod-Suzdal}}
The city traces its origin from a small Russian wooden hillfort that was founded by grand prince [[Yuri II of Vladimir]] in 1221 at the [[Spit of Nizhny Novgorod|confluence]] of two of the most important rivers in his principality, the [[Volga River|Volga]] and [[Oka River|Oka]] rivers. It marked the eastern extreme of [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] settlement until the end of the medieval period, with Russian expansion eastward delayed until the
[[Russo-Kazan Wars|capture of Kazan]] in 1552.{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}}

The independent existence of the medieval fort was threatened by the continuous [[Mordvins|Mordvin]] attacks against it; the major attempt made by forces under [[Purgaz]] in April 1229 was repulsed. After the death of Yuri II on 4 March 1238 at the [[Battle of the Sit River]], the Mongols occupied the fortress. Later a major stronghold for border protection, the fortress of Nizhny Novgorod took advantage of a natural moat formed by the two rivers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}}

Along with [[Moscow]] and [[Tver]], Nizhny Novgorod was among several newly founded towns that escaped devastation during the [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus']] on account of their insignificance, but grew into great centres in Russian political life during the hegemony of the [[Golden Horde]]. With the agreement of the Khan, Nizhny Novgorod was incorporated into the [[Vladimir-Suzdal|Vladimir-Suzdal Principality]] in 1264. After 86 years its importance further increased when the seat of the powerful [[Suzdal]] Principality was moved there from [[Gorodets, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Gorodets]] in 1350. Grand Duke [[Dmitry Konstantinovich]] (1323–1383) sought to make his capital a rival worthy of Moscow; he built a stone citadel and several churches and was a patron of historians. The earliest extant [[manuscript]] of the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'', the ''[[Laurentian Codex]]'', was written for him by the local monk Laurentius in 1377.{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}}

=== Fortress city ===
[[File:Appeal of Minin.jpg|thumb|[[Kuzma Minin]] appeals to the people of Nizhny Novgorod to raise a volunteer army against the [[Polish People|Poles]] (painting by [[Konstantin Makovsky]], 1896).|left]]

After the city's incorporation into the [[Grand Principality of Moscow]] in 1392, the local princes took the name [[Shuysky]] and settled in Moscow, where they were prominent at the court and briefly ascended the throne in the person of [[Vasily I of Moscow]]. After being burnt by the powerful [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] chief [[Edigu]] in 1408, Nizhny Novgorod was restored and regarded by the Muscovites primarily as a great stronghold in [[Russo-Kazan Wars|their wars]] against the [[Khanate of Kazan|Tatars of Kazan]]. The enormous red-brick [[Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin|Kremlin]], one of the strongest and earliest preserved citadels in Russia, was built in 1508–1511 under the supervision of Pietro Francesco. The fortress was strong enough to withstand Tatar sieges in 1520 and 1536.{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}}

In 1612, the so-called "national militia", gathered by a local merchant, [[Kuzma Minin]], and commanded by [[Knyaz]] [[Dmitry Pozharsky]] expelled the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish]] troops from Moscow, thus putting an end to the “[[Time of Troubles]]” and establishing the rule of the [[House of Romanov|Romanov dynasty]]. The main square in front of the [[Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin|Kremlin]] is named after [[Kuzma Minin|Minin]] and [[Dmitry Pozharsky|Pozharsky]], although it is locally known simply as [[Minin and Pozharsky Square|Minin Square]]. Minin's remains are buried in the citadel. In commemoration of these events, on 21 October 2005, an exact copy of the [[Monument to Minin and Pozharsky|Red Square statue]] of Minin and Pozharsky was placed in front of St John the Baptist Church, which is believed to be the place from where the call to the people had been proclaimed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}}

In the course of the following century, the city prospered commercially and was chosen by the [[Stroganov]]s, the wealthiest merchant family of Russia, as a base for their operations. A particular style of [[Russian architecture|architecture]] and icon painting, known as the [[Stroganov school]], developed there at the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries.{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}}

The historical [[coat of arms of Nizhny Novgorod]] in 1781 was a red deer with black horns and hooves on a white field. The modern coat of arms from 2006 is the same, with a ribbon of [[order of Lenin]] and gold crown from above.{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}}

=== Commercial centre ===

[[File:Nizhny Novgorod Fair 1903.jpg|thumb|Main building of the [[All-Russia exhibition 1896|Great Russian Fair]], 19th-century postcard|left]]

In 1817, the [[Nizhny Novgorod Fair|Makaryev Fair]], one of the liveliest in the world, was transferred to Nizhny Novgorod and started to attract millions of visitors annually. By the mid-19th century, the city was firmly established as the [[trade]] capital of the [[Russian Empire]]. The world's first radio receiver by engineer [[Alexander Stepanovich Popov|Alexander Popov]] and the world's first [[hyperboloid structure|hyperboloid tower]] and lattice shell-coverings by engineer [[Vladimir Shukhov]] were demonstrated at the [[All-Russia exhibition 1896|All-Russia industrial and art exhibition in Nizhny Novgorod]] in 1896. According to official Imperial Russian statistics, the population of Nizhny Novgorod as of 14 January 1913 was 97,000.

The largest industrial enterprise was the [[Krasnoye Sormovo Factory No. 112|Sormovo Iron Works]] which was connected by the company's own railway to [[Nizhny Novgorod railway station|Moskovsky railway station]] in the Lower City of Nizhny Novgorod. The Kazansky railway station was in the Upper city. Other industries gradually developed, and by the start of the 20th century, the city was also a first-rank industrial hub. [[Henry Ford]] helped build a large truck and tractor plant ([[GAZ]]) in the late 1920s, sending engineers and mechanics, including future labour leader [[Walter Reuther]].

=== Soviet era ===
[[File:9th May. Day of the German surrender. Gorky 1.jpg|thumb|[[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]] on the [[Minin and Pozharsky Square]], 9 May 1945|left]]

There were no permanent bridges over the Volga or Oka before the [[October Revolution]] in 1917. Temporary bridges were built during the trade fair. The first bridge over the Volga was started by the Moscow–Kazan Railway Company in 1914, but only finished in the [[Soviet Era]] when the railway to [[Kotelnich]] was opened for service in 1927.

The [[Marxism|Marxist]] activist and Tsarist dissident [[Maxim Gorky]] was born in Nizhny Novgorod in 1868 as Alexey Maximovich Peshkov. In his novels he described the dismal life of the city [[proletariat]]. When he returned to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1932 on the invitation of [[Joseph Stalin]], the city was renamed '''Gorky'''. The city bore Gorky's name until 1990. His childhood home is preserved as a museum, known as the Kashirin House, after Alexey's grandfather who owned the place.

{{Main|Bombing of Gorky in World War II}}

During [[World War II]], from 1941 to 1943, Gorky was subjected to [[Strategic bombing during World War II|air raids]] and bombardments by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. The Germans tried to destroy the city industry because it was a major supplier of military equipment to the front. Of the attacks made in the rear of the [[Soviet Union]], these became the most powerful in the entire duration of the war.{{citeneeded|date=May 2024}}

During much of the Soviet era, the city was [[closed city|closed]] to foreigners to safeguard the security of Soviet military research and production facilities, even though it was a popular stopping point for Soviet tourists travelling up and down the Volga in tourist boats. Unusually for a Soviet city of that size, even street maps were not available for sale until the mid-1970s. In 1970, by the Decree of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR]], the city was awarded the [[Order of Lenin]]. [[Mátyás Rákosi]], the former Stalinist General Secretary of [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]]'s [[Hungarian Working People's Party|communist party]], died in exile there in 1971. On 20 November 1985, in the city, the first section of the [[Nizhny Novgorod Metro|metro]] was launched. The [[physicist]] and [[Nobel prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Andrei Sakharov]] was exiled there during 1980–1986 to limit his contacts with foreigners. An end to the “closed” status of the city accompanied the reinstatement of the city's original name in 1990.<ref name=PrevName2>Decree of 22 October 1990, Article&nbsp;1</ref>

=== Post-Soviet era ===
The 800th anniversary of Nizhny Novgorod was celebrated on 21 August 2021. It celebrated the history and the great people who came from the city. The climax of the celebration was the city's 800th Anniversary Gala Show. [[Natalia Vodianova]] gave a speech and [[Vladimir Putin]] was in attendance.<ref>{{cite web |title=NIZHNY NOVGOROD 800TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION |url=https://www.mir-travel.com/en/news/nizhny-800/ |website=MIR Travel Company |access-date=June 4, 2022 |archive-date=August 12, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220812190612/https://www.mir-travel.com/en/news/nizhny-800/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Central Bank of Russia]] issued commemorative coins to honor the 800th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bank of Russia issues new commemorative coins dedicated to the 800th anniversary of Nizhny Novgorod |url=https://cbr.ru/eng/press/pr/?file=27052021_123528ENG_COINS26052021_170836.htm |website=Bank of Russia |access-date=June 4, 2022 |archive-date=June 4, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220604044521/https://cbr.ru/eng/press/pr/?file=27052021_123528ENG_COINS26052021_170836.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Location Map of Rayons NN 2020.svg|thumb|250x250px|Administrative divisions of Nizhny Novgorod]]
Nizhny Novgorod is divided by the [[Oka River]] into two distinct parts. The Upper City ({{langx|ru|Нагорная часть}}, ''Nagornaya chast'', ''Mountainous part'') is located on the hilly eastern (right) bank of the Oka. It includes three of the eight city districts into which the city is administratively divided:

# {{background color|#FFA500|  }} [[Sovetsky City District, Nizhny Novgorod|Sovetsky]]

The Lower City ({{langx|ru|Заречная часть}}, ''Zarechnaya chast'', ''Over river part'') occupies the low (western) side of the Oka, and includes five city districts:

===Time===
The area operates in what is referred to in international standards as [[Moscow Standard Time]] (MSK), which is 3 hours ahead of [[UTC]], or [[UTC+3]]. [[Daylight saving time]] is no longer observed.

===Climate===
In 1834, the first weather station was opened in Nizhny Novgorod. A century later it transformed into Gorky Hydrometeorological service; since 1978, it has been known as the Higher Volga hydrometeorology and natural habitat control department.

The [[climate]] in the region is continental, specifically [[humid continental]] (''Dfb''), and it is similar to the [[climate of Moscow|climate in Moscow]], although colder in winter, which lasts from late November until late March with a permanent snow cover. Average temperatures range from {{convert|+19|C}} in July to {{convert|-9|C}} in January. Average annual temperature is {{convert|+4.8|C}}, wind speed 2.8&nbsp;m/s, air humidity 76%. Being far enough away from the [[Baltic Sea]] for maritime effects to lower, Nizhny Novgorod has similar winters to [[Bothnian Bay]] climates near the [[Arctic Circle]], but instead has very warm summers for its latitude.

Nizhny receives on average 1,775 hours of sunshine a year. The maximum duration of daylight is in June (17 hours 44 minutes), and the minimum in December (6 hours 52 minutes). Overcast is often reported in winter: 75% to 80% of the time the sky is covered in clouds, while it's only 49 to 56% in April through to August. In autumn and winter, the overcast is usually in the mornings, then the sky clears in the afternoon. In spring and summer, on the contrary, it is clear in the mornings, while towards midday clouds cluster ('[[cumulus cloud]]'), and disappear towards the evening.

In spring, temperatures set above zero around 5 April and stay until the end of October. On average precipitation comes at 653&nbsp;mm per year, mostly in July and least of all in March. Generally, 180 days out of 365 enjoy some form of precipitation. [[Snow]] first comes in October but the blanket of snow insulates the ground at November-end and melts mid-April. As a rule, the air temperature in winter ranges from {{convert|-10|C}} to {{convert|-20|C}}. A storm rarely takes place in winter here (a few dates to mention are 27 November 1940, 30 November 1951, 14 February 1960, and 3 December 1962). In [[spring (season)|spring]] there's less precipitation than in other seasons. Spring flies by as snow melts in the second half of March and is normally gone by the end of April. [[Summer]] comes at the beginning of June, when the temperature sets around +15. Maximum heat can be observed towards the third decade of July. Average temperatures range from {{convert|+15|C}} to {{convert|+20|C}}. A maximum temperature of {{convert|+38.2|C}} was recorded during the [[2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat waves]]. Summer [[rain]] is short but intense, with strong [[wind]]. In September, temperature starts to drop and gets below {{convert|+10|C}} in the mid-20s of the month. It rains often and heavily in [[autumn]], and the sky is overcast.

The city of Nizhny Novgorod is governed by the city administration and the City Duma. The mayor of the city may be the chairman of the City Duma; however, it may be another person.

The mayor is at the head of the city. The city administration and the city duma are subordinate to him. There are no direct elections of the mayor for city residents. The mayor is appointed by the decision of the [[City Duma of Nizhny Novgorod|City Duma]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Вернутся ли в Нижний Новгород прямые выборы мэра? |url=https://www.polit.nnov.ru/2014/01/28/election/ |access-date=2023-02-12 |website=www.polit.nnov.ru |archive-date=February 12, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230212110812/https://www.polit.nnov.ru/2014/01/28/election/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Since 28 October 2020, Yuri Shalabaev has been the mayor of Nizhny Novgorod.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Мэр Нижнего Новгорода Владимир Панов сложил полномочия |url=https://www.the-village.ru/city/news/380469-mer-nizhnego-novgoroda-vladimir-panov-slozhil-polnomochiya |access-date=2023-02-12 |website=The Village |language=ru |archive-date=February 12, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230212110812/https://www.the-village.ru/city/news/380469-mer-nizhnego-novgoroda-vladimir-panov-slozhil-polnomochiya |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{Main|Mayor of Nizhny Novgorod|City Duma of Nizhny Novgorod}}

[[File:Шалабаев Ю.В.jpg|thumb|The current mayor of Nizhny Novgorod is Yuri Shalabaev]]
From 1991 to 2009, the mayor of the city was elected by the townspeople for a term of 5 years. During this time, four people have been in this post: Dmitry Bednyakov, [[Ivan Sklyarov]], Yuri Lebedev, [[Vadim Bulavinov]] (twice).

In recent years, the role of the regional government headed by the [[Governor of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|governor]] in city affairs has significantly increased.

On 25 October 2010, the position of mayor was abolished and instead two formal positions appeared - the head of the city and the head of the administration. Oleg Sorokin was elected mayor of the city. At an extraordinary meeting of the City Duma on 3 December 2010, Oleg Kondrashov was approved as the head of the administration of Nizhny Novgorod.

On 22 July 2015, by the decision of the City Duma of Nizhny Novgorod, Kondrashov was removed from his post. Since then, he has been wanted by the [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast Police|police]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Курильченко |first=Алексей |date=2020-10-29 |title=Экс-глава администрации Нижнего Новгорода объявлен в международный розыск |url=https://tvzvezda.ru/news/20201029452-s5wiT.html |access-date=2023-02-12 |website=Телеканал «Звезда» |language=ru |archive-date=February 12, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230212110810/https://tvzvezda.ru/news/20201029452-s5wiT.html |url-status=live }}</ref> On 19 December 2017, the mayor of the city, Oleg Sorokin, was arrested.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Бизнес-империя бывшего мэра Нижнего Новгорода: чем занимался до ареста Олег Сорокин |url=https://www.currenttime.tv/a/28981038.html |access-date=2023-02-12 |website=Настоящее Время |language=ru |archive-date=February 12, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230212110809/https://www.currenttime.tv/a/28981038.html |url-status=live }}</ref> On 7 March 2019, the Nizhny Novgorod District Court sentenced him to 10 years in a strict regime colony with a fine of 460.8 million rubles.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Олег Сорокин получил десять лет лишения свободы |url=https://www.vremyan.ru/news/oleg_sorokin_poluchil_10_let_lisheniya_svobody.html |access-date=2023-02-12 |website=www.vremyan.ru |language=ru |archive-date=February 12, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230212110810/https://www.vremyan.ru/news/oleg_sorokin_poluchil_10_let_lisheniya_svobody.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 7 October 2015, [[Ivan Karnilin]] became the head of the city. In December 2016, opposition blogger [[Alexei Navalny]] published a video of his investigation, featuring Karnilin as the hero. As it turned out, it is possible that his ex-wife bought two apartments in [[Miami]] in 2013 and 2014 for a total of almost $2 million.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Вопросы агитации.

After Ivan Karnilin, the last position of the head of the city was held by [[Elizaveta Solonchenko]], who held it from 21 June to 20 December 2017. After that, the post of mayor of the city returned, which was taken by [[Vladimir Panov]]. He held this position from 17 January 2018 to 6 May 2020. Panov resigned ahead of schedule in connection with the transfer to a new position of Deputy Chairman of the State Commission for the Development of the Arctic.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Экс-глава Нижнего Новгорода Владимир Панов назначен зампредом Госкомиссии по вопросам развития Арктики |url=https://www.niann.ru/?id=552561 |access-date=2023-02-12 |website=www.niann.ru |language=ru |archive-date=June 3, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200603182739/https://www.niann.ru/?id=552561 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The coat of arms and flag of the city depicts a red deer, which is a symbol of nobility, purity and greatness, life, wisdom and justice. The current city coat of arms and flag were adopted on 20 December 2006.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-02-12 |title=Постановление № 25 |url=https://admgor.nnov.ru/upload/getODA/document467_0.html |website=[[City Duma of Nizhny Novgorod|Администрация Нижнего Новгорода]] |language=ru}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Государственные символы России » Символы субъектов РФ » Нижний Новгород |url=http://simvolika.rsl.ru/index.php?doc=933 |access-date=2023-02-12 |website=simvolika.rsl.ru |archive-date=February 12, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230212113452/http://simvolika.rsl.ru/index.php?doc=933 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:NN BolPokrovskaya Street 08-2016 img2.jpg|thumb|State Bank of Nizhny Novgorod, built in 1913]]Since the reign of [[Emperor of all the Russias|Emperor]] [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]], Nizhny Novgorod has become the centre of all-Russian merchants. On 15 July 1822 the largest [[Nizhny Novgorod Fair|Nizhny Novgorod fair]] was solemnly opened on the left bank of the [[Oka (river)|Oka]]. Then Nizhny Novgorod became the main city of all-Russian and international trade.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=История {{!}} Нижегородская Ярмарка |url=http://www.yarmarka.ru/about/ |access-date=2023-02-12 |website=www.yarmarka.ru |archive-date=February 12, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230212125935/http://www.yarmarka.ru/about/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1929, the Fair was closed, and the city's economy began to develop in a completely different direction.

The Soviet city of Gorky became one of the largest industrial centres in Russia, the leading role in which belonged to the enterprises of mechanical engineering, metalworking and information technology. At the same time, the first auto giant, the [[GAZ|Gorky Automobile Plant]], was built.<ref>{{Cite web |title=История завода "ГАЗ" |url=https://museum.gaz.ru/history/gaz-history/ |access-date=2023-02-12 |website=museum.gaz.ru |archive-date=June 19, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220619211949/https://museum.gaz.ru/history/gaz-history/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The very foundation of the city at the confluence of two navigable rivers predetermined both its military-strategic and commercial significance. Local merchants traded not only with Moscow, Kazan, Yaroslavl, Astrakhan, but also with the cities of Europe and Central Asia.<ref>{{Cite web |title=2014 год: 300-летие Нижегородской губернии |url=https://www.archive-nnov.ru/?id=3677 |access-date=2023-02-12 |website=www.archive-nnov.ru |language=ru |archive-date=February 12, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230212125939/https://www.archive-nnov.ru/?id=3677 |url-status=live }}</ref> In May 1767, during the royal visit of [[Emperor of all the Russias|Empress]] [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]], she ordered the creation of a new enterprise, the Nizhny Novgorod Trading Company.
