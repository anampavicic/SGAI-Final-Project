'''Berkane''' ({{Langx|ar|بركان}}) is a city in northeastern [[Morocco]], limited by the Mediterranean to the north, the Kis river (Moroccan-[[Algeria]]n border) and [[Oujda Province]] in the east, [[Nador Province]] to the west, and [[Taourirt Province]] in the south. It is the capital of [[Berkane Province]].

==Population==
The city recorded a population of 109,237 in the [[2014 Moroccan census]].<ref name="census2014" /> The eastern dialect of [[Moroccan Arabic]] is spoken by most citizens, although [[Berber languages|Berber]] is also spoken by some people.{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}}

According to the 2014 census, the population of the Berkane agglomeration is 306,901, that is, an estimated 12.5 percent of the population of the eastern region, with a high density of 145.7 people per square kilometer compared to 25.7 people per square kilometer in relation to the region and a high [[urbanization]] rate of 63.2 percent.{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}}

===Historic population===
The population rose from 368 in 1917 to 3,600 in 1936 and then doubled in 1947, it reached 7,545, then jumped to 20,496 in 1960, then to 60,490 in 1982 and 77,026 in 1994. In the year 1996, the city's population was estimated at 82,000.{{Cn|date=August 2022}}

==Recent city==
The city of Berkane is considered an agricultural city as a result of the irrigation policy that colonialism followed, starting in the middle of the first half of the twentieth century, in the major irrigated circles. Especially since it is located on one of the richest plains in [[Morocco]], the Tarifa plain.{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}}

The emergence of Berkane as a city, and its development, was linked to the local agricultural wealth. However the administrative leadership of the fledgling city, which abolished the old political entities of the Bni Iznasen tribes, was behind the French political decision in the colonial period to assign the role of direct leadership to Berkane over the neighboring tribes. The development of the [[Agriculture|agricultural]] economy and the improvement of the standard of living in the city have contributed to emptying the tribes from their population and displacing the human weight from the mountain fortress to the open plain and facilitated the process of military control of the [[French Protectorate in Morocco|French occupation]] of the region. The massive influx of workers in the agriculture sector from different Moroccan regions has also disrupted the homogeneous tribal fabric.{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}}

==Economy==
Berkane is considered a major player in the [[citrus]] fruit industry in North-Morocco, and high-quality fresh fruit and vegetables are plentiful year round. It is known for its farms of [[clementine]]s. Also, a large statue of an orange is at the center of town. It is very close to [[Saïdia]], a popular beach resort town on the Mediterranean, as well as Tafoughalt, a small village in the nearby mountains known for its healthy air and herb markets.{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}}
