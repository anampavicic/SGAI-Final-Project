Hebron is capital of the West Bank's largest [[Governorates of Palestine|governorate]], known as [[Hebron Governorate]]. With a population of 201,063 in the city limits, the adjacent metropolitan area within the governorate is home to over 700,000 people. Hebron spans across an area of {{Convert|74.102|km2|sqmi}}. It is the [[List of cities in Palestine|third largest city in the country]], followed by [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and [[Jerusalem]]. The city is often considered one of the [[Four Holy Cities|four holy cities]] in [[Judaism]] as well as in [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]]. 

It is considered one of the oldest cities in the Levant. According to the [[Bible]], [[Abraham]] settled in Hebron and bought the Cave of the Patriarchs as burial place for his wife [[Sarah]]. Biblical tradition holds that the patriarchs Abraham, [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]], along with their wives Sarah, [[Rebecca]], and [[Leah]], were buried in the cave. The city is also recognized in the Bible as the place where [[David]] was anointed [[Kings of Israel and Judah|king of]] [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Israel]]. Following the [[Babylonian captivity]], the [[Edom]]ites settled in Hebron. During the first century BCE, [[Herod the Great]] built the wall that still surrounds the Cave of the Patriarchs, which later became a [[Church (building)|church]], and then a [[Ibrahimi Mosque|mosque]]. With the exception of a [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|brief Crusader control]], successive Muslim dynasties ruled Hebron from the 6th century CE until the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire|dissolution]] following [[World War I]], when the city became part of [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandatory Palestine]].

The [[1929 Hebron massacre|1929 riots]] and the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab uprising of 1936–39]] led the British government to evacuate the Jewish community from Hebron. The [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] saw the entire West Bank, including Hebron, [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|occupied and annexed]] by [[Jordan]], and since the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], the city has been under [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|Israeli military occupation]]. Following Israeli occupation, Jewish presence was restored in the city. Since the 1997 [[Protocol Concerning the Redeployment in Hebron|Hebron Protocol]], most of Hebron has been governed by the [[Palestinian National Authority]]. The city is often described as a "microcosm" of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] and the [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank]]. The 1997 protocol divided the city into two sectors — H1 Hebron, controlled by the Palestinian National Authority, and [[Kiryat Arba|H2 Hebron]], managed by Israeli authorities. All security arrangements and travel permits for local residents are coordinated between the Palestinian Authority and Israel via the [[Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories|COGAT]]. The Jewish settlers have their own governing municipal body, the Committee of the Jewish Community of Hebron.

The largest city in the southern West Bank, Hebron is chief commercial and industrial center in the region. It is a busy hub of trade, generating roughly a third of the area's [[gross domestic product|GDP]], largely due to the sale of [[limestone]] from quarries in its area. Hebron has a local reputation for its grapes, figs, ceramics, plastics, [[Palestinian pottery|pottery]] workshops, metalworking and [[Hebron glass|glassblowing]] industry. The city is home to numerous shopping malls. The [[Old City of Hebron]] features narrow, winding streets, flat-roofed stone houses, and old [[bazaar]]s. It is recognized as a [[World Heritage Site]] by the [[UNESCO]]. Hebron is also known as a regional educational and medical hub.

==Etymology==
The name "Hebron" appears to trace back to two [[northwest Semitic languages]],{{efn|Y.L. Arbeitman, ''The Hittite is Thy Mother: An Anatolian Approach to Genesis 23'', (1981) pp. 889-1026, argues that an [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European root]] *''ar-'', with the same meaning as the semitic root ''ḥbr'', namely 'to join' may underlie part of the earlier name Kiryat-'''Ar'''ba,{{sfn|Niesiolowski-Spano|2016|p=124}}}} which coalesce in the form ''ḥbr'', having reflexes in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Amorite]], with a basic sense of 'unite' and connoting a range of meanings from "colleague" to "friend". In the proper name ''Hebron'', the original sense may have been ''alliance''.<ref>{{harvnb|Cazelles|1981|p=195}} compares Amorite ''ḫibru[[Mimation|(m)]]''. Two roots are in play, ''ḥbr/ḫbr''. The root has magical overtones, and develops pejorative connotations in late Biblical usage.</ref>

The [[Arabic]] name for Hebron, ''al-Khalīl'', emerged as the city's actual name in the 13th century.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal |last=Talmon-Heller |first=Daniella |date=2007 |title=Graves, Relics and Sanctuariese: The Evolution of Syrian Sacred Topography (Eleventh-Thirteenth Centuries) |url=https://poj.peeters-leuven.be/content.php?url=article&id=2020748 |journal=[[ARAM Periodical]] |volume=19 |pages=606}}</ref> Earlier Muslim sources refer to the city as Ḥabra or Ḥabrūn.<ref name=":2" /> The name ''al-Khalīl'' derives from the [[Quran|Qur'anic]] epithet for [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]], ''Khalil al-Rahman'' ({{lang|ar|إبراهيم خليل الرحمن}}) "Beloved of the Merciful" or "Friend of God".<ref>Qur'an 4:125/Surah 4 Aya (verse) 125, ''[[Qur'an]]'' ({{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/hollywood/lot/6093/4nisa.html |title=source text |access-date=2007-07-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027154527/http://www.geocities.com/hollywood/lot/6093/4nisa.html |archive-date=October 27, 2009}})</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Büssow|2011|p=194 n.220}}</ref> Arabic ''Al-Khalil'' thus precisely translates the ancient Hebrew [[toponym]] ''Ḥebron'', understood as ''ḥaḇer'' (friend).<ref name="Sharon 2007 104">{{harvnb|Sharon|2007|p=104}}</ref> 

== History ==
{{see also|Timeline of Hebron}}

===Bronze and Iron Age===
Archaeological excavations reveal traces of strong fortifications dated to the Early [[Bronze Age]], covering some 24–30 [[dunam]]s centered around [[Tel Rumeida]]. The city flourished in the 17th–18th centuries BCE before being destroyed by fire, and was resettled in the late Middle Bronze Age.<ref>{{harvnb|Negev|Gibson|2001|pp=225–5<!--?range of pages-->}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Na'aman|2005|p=180}}</ref> This older Hebron was originally a [[Canaan]]ite royal city.<ref>{{harvnb|Towner|2001|pp=144–45}}: "[T]he city was a Canaanite royal center long before it became Israelite".</ref> [[Abraham|Abrahamic legend]] associates the city with the [[Biblical Hittites|Hittites]].{{Clarify|reason=The Hittite identity of Efron doesn't mean that the whole city is associated with the Hittites.|date=July 2023}} It has been conjectured that Hebron might have been the capital of [[Šuwardata|Shuwardata]] of [[Gath (city)|Gath]], an [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] contemporary of Jerusalem's regent, [[Abdi-Heba|Abdi-Ḫeba]],<ref>{{harvnb|Albright|2000|p=110}}</ref> although the Hebron hills were almost devoid of settlements in the Late Bronze Age.<ref>{{harvnb|Na'aman|2005|pp=77–78}}</ref> The [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic traditions]] associated with Hebron are nomadic. This may also reflect a [[Kenite]] element, since the nomadic Kenites are said to have long occupied the city,<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1903|p=200}}.</ref> and ''Heber'' is the name for a Kenite clan.<ref>{{harvnb|Kraeling|1925|p=179}}.</ref> In the narrative of the later Hebrew conquest, Hebron was one of two centres under Canaanite control. They were ruled by the three sons of [[Anak]] (''b<sup>e</sup>nê/y<sup>e</sup>lîdê hāʿănaq'').<ref>{{harvnb|Na'aman|2005|p=361}} These non-Semitic names perhaps echo either a tradition of a group of elite professional troops (Philistines, Hittites), formed in Canaan whose ascendancy was overthrown by the West-Semitic clan of Caleb. They would have migrated from the Negev,</ref> or may reflect some Kenite and [[Kenizzite]] migration from the Negev to Hebron, since terms related to the Kenizzites appear to be close to [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]]. This suggests that behind the [[Anakim]] legend lies some early Hurrian population.<ref>{{cite book|author=Joseph Blenkinsopp|author-link=Joseph Blenkinsopp|title=Gibeon and Israel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uxg9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA114|year=1972|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-08368-3|page=18}}</ref> In Biblical lore they are represented as descendants of the [[Nephilim]].<ref>[[Joshua]] 10:3, 5, 3–39; 12:10, 13. {{harvnb|Na'aman|2005|p=177}} doubts this tradition. "The book of Joshua is not a reliable source for either a historical or a territorial discussion of the Late Bronze Age, and its evidence must be disregarded".</ref> The [[Book of Genesis]] mentions that it was formerly called [[Kiryat Arba|Kirjath-arba]], or "city of four", possibly referring to the four pairs or couples who were buried there, or four tribes, or four quarters,<ref>{{harvnb|Mulder|2004|p=165}}</ref> four hills,<ref>{{harvnb|Alter|1996|p=108}}.</ref> or a confederated settlement of four families.<ref>{{harvnb|Hamilton|1995|p=126}}.</ref>

The story of Abraham's purchase of the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] from the [[Biblical Hittites|Hittites]] constitutes a seminal element in what was to become the Jewish attachment to the land<ref>{{harvnb|Finkelstein|Silberman|2001|p=45}}.</ref> in that it signified the first "real estate" of Israel long before the conquest under Joshua.<ref>{{harvnb|Lied|2008|pp=154–62, 162}}</ref> In settling here, Abraham is described as making his first [[wiktionary:covenant|covenant]], an alliance with two local [[Amorite]] clans who became his ''ba'alei brit'' or ''masters of the covenant''.<ref>{{harvnb|Elazar|1998|p=128}}: ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].ch. 23)</ref>[[File:Hebron136.JPG|thumb|Excavations at [[Tel Rumeida]]|left]]

It is said to have been wrested from the Canaanites by either [[Joshua]], who is said to have wiped out all of its previous inhabitants, "destroying everything that drew breath, as the Lord God of Israel had commanded",<ref>{{harvnb|Glick|1994|p=46}}, citing {{bibleverse|Joshua|10:36–42}} and the influence this has had on certain settlers in the West Bank.</ref> or the [[Tribe of Judah]] as a whole, or specifically [[Caleb]] the Judahite.<ref>{{harvnb|Gottwald|1999|p=153}}: "certain conquests claimed for Joshua are elsewhere attributed to single tribes or clans, for example, in the case of Hebron (in {{bibleverse|Joshua|10:36–37}}, Hebron's capture is attributed to Joshua; in {{bibleverse|Judges|1:10}} to Judah; in Judges 1:20 and Joshua 14:13–14; 15:13–14" to Caleb.</ref> The town itself, with some contiguous pasture land, is then said to have been granted to the [[Levites]] of the clan of [[Kohathites|Kohath]], while the fields of the city, as well as its surrounding villages were assigned to Caleb ({{bibleverse|Joshua 21:3–12; 1 Chronicles 6:54–56|multi=yes}}),<ref>{{harvnb|Bratcher|Newman|1983|p=262}}.</ref> who expels the three giants, [[Sheshai]], [[Ahiman]], and [[Talmai]], who ruled the city.

See {{bibleverse|Joshua 20, 1–7|multi=yes}}.</ref>

As is shown by the discovery at [[Lachish]], the second most important city in the [[Kingdom of Judah]] after Jerusalem,<ref>{{harvnb|Hasson|2016}}</ref> of seals with the inscription [[LMLK seal|''lmlk Hebron'']] (to the king Hebron),<ref name="Sharon 2007 104"/> Hebron continued to constitute an important local economic centre, given its strategic position on the crossroads between the [[Dead Sea]] to the east, Jerusalem to the north, the Negev and Egypt to the south, and the [[Shfela|Shepelah]] and the [[Israeli coastal plain|coastal plain]] to the west.<ref>{{harvnb|Jericke|2003|p=17}}</ref> Lying along [[Way of the Patriarchs|trading routes]], it remained administratively and politically dependent on Jerusalem for this period.<ref>{{harvnb|Jericke|2003|pp=26ff., 31}}.</ref>

===Classic antiquity===
After the destruction of the [[First Temple]], most of the Jewish inhabitants of Hebron were exiled, and according to the conventional view,<ref>{{harvnb|Carter|1999|pp=96–99}} Carter challenges this view on the grounds that it has no archeological support.</ref> some researchers found traces of [[Edom]]ite presence after the 5th–4th centuries BCE, as the area became [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid province]],<ref>{{harvnb|Lemaire|2006|p=419}}</ref> and, in the wake of [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest, Hebron was throughout the [[Hellenistic period]] under the influence of Idumea (as the new area inhabited by the Edomites was called during the [[Yehud medinata|Persian]], [[History of ancient Israel and Judah#Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Judea (Roman province)#Judea as Roman province(s)|Roman]] periods), as is attested by inscriptions for that period bearing names with the Edomite God [[Qaus|Qōs]].<ref>{{harvnb|Jericke|2003|p=19}}.</ref> Jews also appear to have lived there after the return from the [[Babylonian exile]] ({{bibleverse|Nehemiah|11:25}}). During the [[Maccabean revolt]], Hebron was burnt and plundered by [[Judas Maccabeus|Judah Maccabee]] who fought against the Edomites in 167 BCE.<ref>{{harvnb|Josephus|1860|p=334}} [[Josephus Flavius]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', Bk. 12, ch.8, para.6.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Duke|2010|pp=93–94}} is sceptical.'This should be considered a raid on Hebron instead of a conquest based on subsequent events in the book of I Maccabees.'</ref> The city appears to have long resisted [[Hasmoneans|Hasmonean dominance]], however, and indeed as late as the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] was still considered [[Idumean]].<ref>{{harvnb|Duke|2010|p=94}}</ref>

[[File:Hebron001.JPG|right|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Cave of the Patriarchs]]]]The present day city of Hebron was settled in the valley downhill from Tel Rumeida at the latest by Roman times.<ref>{{harvnb|Jericke|2003|p=17}}:'Spätestens in römischer Zeit ist die Ansiedlung im Tal beim heutigen Stadtzentrum zu finden'.</ref> [[Herod the Great]], king of Judea, built the wall that still surrounds the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]]. During the [[First Jewish–Roman War]], Hebron was captured and plundered by [[Simon Bar Giora]], a leader of the [[Zealots]], without bloodshed. The "little town" was later laid to waste by [[Vespasian]]'s officer [[Sextus Vettulenus Cerialis]].<ref>{{harvnb|Josephus|1860|p=701}} Josephus, ''[[The Jewish War]]'', Bk 4, ch. 9, p. 9.</ref> [[Josephus]] wrote that he "slew all he found there, young and old, and burnt down the town". After the suppression of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] in 135 CE, innumerable Jewish captives were sold into slavery at Hebron's [[Mamre|Terebinth]] slave-market.<ref>{{harvnb|Schürer|Millar|Vermes|1973|p=553 n.178}} citing [[Jerome]], ''in Zachariam'' 11:5; ''in Hieremiam'' 6:18; ''Chronicon paschale.''</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hezser|2002|p=96}}.</ref>

The city was part of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in [[Palaestina Prima]] province at the [[Diocese of the East]]. The Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]] erected a Christian church over the Cave of Machpelah in the 6th century CE, which was later destroyed by the [[Sassanid]] general [[Shahrbaraz]] in 614 when [[Khosrau II]]'s armies besieged and took Jerusalem.<ref>{{harvnb|Norwich|1999|p=285}}<!-- check Peng ed  p. 285 (1988)--></ref> Jews were not permitted to reside in Hebron under Byzantine rule.<ref name="Scharfstein 124">{{harvnb|Scharfstein|1994|p=124}}.</ref> The sanctuary itself however was spared by the Persians, in deference to the Jewish population, who were numerous in the [[Byzantine–Sassanid War of 602–628|Sassanid army]].<ref name="Salaville 1910 185">{{harvnb|Salaville|1910|p=185}}</ref>

===Muslim conquest and Islamic caliphate===
Hebron was one of the last cities of Palestine to fall to the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Islamic invasion in the 7th century]], possibly the reason why Hebron is not mentioned in any traditions of the Arab conquest.<ref>{{harvnb|Gil|1997|pp=56–57}} cites the late testimony of two monks, Eudes and Arnoul CE 1119–1120:'When they (the Muslims) came to Hebron they were amazed to see the strong and handsome structures of the walls and they could not find an opening through which to enter, then the Jews happened to come, who lived in the area under the former rule of the Greeks (that is the Byzantines), and they said to the Muslims: give us (a letter of security) that we may continue to live (in our places) under your rule (literally-amongst you) and permit us to build a synagogue in front of the entrance (to the city). If you will do this, we shall show you where you can break in. And it was so'.</ref> When the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] established its rule over Hebron in 638, the Muslims converted the Byzantine church at the site of Abraham's tomb into a mosque.<ref name="Scharfstein 124"/> It became an important station on the caravan trading route from Egypt, and also as a way-station for pilgrims making the yearly hajj from Damascus.<ref>{{harvnb|Büssow|2011|p=195}}</ref> After the fall of the city, Jerusalem's conqueror, Caliph [[Umar|Omar ibn al-Khattab]] permitted Jewish people to return and to construct a small synagogue within the Herodian precinct.<ref>{{harvnb|Hiro|1999|p=166}}.</ref>

Catholic bishop [[Arculf]], who visited the Holy Land during the [[Umayyad Chaliphate|Umayyad period]], described the city as unfortified and poor. In his writings he also mentioned camel caravans transporting firewood from Hebron to Jerusalem, which implies there was a presence of Arab nomads in the region at that time.<ref>Frenkel, 2011, p. 28–29</ref> Trade greatly expanded, in particular with [[Bedouin]]s in the [[Negev]] (''al-Naqab'') and the population to the east of the [[Dead Sea]] (''Baḥr Lūṭ'').

===Crusader and Ayyubid period===
{{see also|Vassals of the Kingdom of Jerusalem}}
The [[Caliphate]] lasted in the area until 1099, when the Christian [[Crusade]]r [[Godfrey de Bouillon]] took Hebron and renamed it "Castellion Saint Abraham".<ref>{{harvnb|Robinson|Smith|1856|p=78}}:"'The Castle of St. Abraham' was the generic Crusader name for Hebron."</ref> It was designated capital of the southern district of the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]<ref>Avraham Lewensohn.

As a [[Franks|Frankish]] garrison of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], its defence was precarious being 'little more than an island in a Moslem ocean'.<ref>{{harvnb|Runciman|1965b|p=4}}</ref> The Crusaders converted the [[mosque]] and the [[synagogue]] into a church. In 1106, an Egyptian campaign thrust into southern Palestine and almost succeeded the following year in wresting Hebron back from the Crusaders under [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]], who personally led the counter-charge to beat the Muslim forces off. In the year 1113 during the reign of [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem]], according to [[Ali ibn abi bakr al-Harawi|Ali of Herat]] (writing in 1173), a certain part over the cave of Abraham had given way, and "a number of Franks had made their entrance therein". And they discovered "(the bodies) of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob", "their shrouds having fallen to pieces, lying propped up against a wall...Then the King, after providing new shrouds, caused the place to be closed once more". Similar information is given in [[Ali ibn al-Athir|Ibn at Athir]]'s Chronicle under the year 1119; "In this year was opened the tomb of Abraham, and those of his two sons Isaac and Jacob ...Many people saw the Patriarch. Their limbs had nowise been [[Disturbance (archaeology)|disturbed]], and beside them were placed lamps of gold and of silver."<ref>{{harvnb|Le Strange|1890|pp=[[commons:File:Strange.317.jpg|317]]–[[commons:File:Strange.318.jpg|18]]}}</ref> The [[Damascus|Damascene]] nobleman and historian [[Ibn al-Qalanisi]] in his chronicle also alludes at this time to the discovery of [[relics]] purported to be those of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, a discovery that excited eager curiosity among all three communities in Palestine, Muslim, Jewish, and Christian.<ref>{{harvnb|Kohler|1896|pp=447ff.}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Runciman|1965b|p=319}}.</ref> Towards the end of the period of Crusader rule, in 1166 [[Maimonides]] visited Hebron and wrote,<blockquote>On Sunday, 9 Marheshvan (17 October), I left Jerusalem for Hebron to kiss the tombs of my ancestors in the Cave.

A royal domain, Hebron was handed over to [[Philip of Milly]] in 1161 and joined with the [[Oultrejordain|Seigneurie of Transjordan]].

The Kurdish Muslim [[Saladin]] retook Hebron in 1187 – again with Jewish assistance according to one late tradition, in exchange for a letter of security allowing them to return to the city and build a synagogue there.<ref>{{harvnb|Gil|1997|p=207}}. Note to editors. This account, always in Moshe Gil, refers to two distinct events, the Arab conquest from Byzantium, and the Kurdish-Arab conquest from Crusaders.

===Mamluk period===
In 1260, after [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] [[Sultan]] [[Baibars]] defeated the Mongol army, the [[minaret]]s were built onto the sanctuary. Six years later, while on pilgrimage to Hebron, Baibars promulgated an edict forbidding Christians and Jews from entering the sanctuary,<ref>{{harvnb|Micheau|2006|p=402}}</ref> and the climate became less tolerant of Jews and Christians than it had been under the prior [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] rule. The edict for the exclusion of Christians and Jews was not strictly enforced until the middle of the 14th-century and by 1490, not even Muslims were permitted to enter the caverns.<ref>{{harvnb|Murphy-O'Connor|1998|p=274}}.</ref> The mill at [[Artas, Bethlehem|Artas]] was built in 1307, and the profits from its income were dedicated to the hospital in Hebron.<ref>{{harvnb|Sharon|1997|pp=117–18}}.</ref> Between 1318 and 1320, the [[Na'ib]] of [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and much of coastal and interior Palestine ordered the construction of [[al-Jawali Mosque|Jawli Mosque]] to enlarge the prayer space for worshipers at the Ibrahimi Mosque.<ref>Dandis, Wala.

Hebron was visited by some important rabbis over the next two centuries, among them [[Nachmanides]] (1270) and [[Ishtori Haparchi|Ishtori HaParchi]] (1322) who noted the [[Old Jewish cemetery, Hebron|old Jewish cemetery]] there.

===Early Ottoman period===
[[File:Hebron - Roberts 1839.jpg|thumb|right|Hebron in 1839, after a drawing by [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], in ''[[The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia]]'']]

The expansion of the [[Ottoman Empire]] along the southern Mediterranean coast under sultan [[Selim I]] coincided with the establishment of [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] commissions by the [[Catholic Monarchs]] in Spain in 1478, which ended centuries of the Iberian ''convivencia'' (coexistence). The ensuing [[Alhambra Decree|expulsions of the Jews]] drove many [[Sephardi Jews]] into the Ottoman provinces, and a slow influx of Jews to the Holy Land took place, with some notable Sephardi [[Kabbalah|kabbalists]] settling in Hebron.{{sfn|Green|2007|pp=xv–xix}} Over the following two centuries, there was a significant migration of Bedouin tribal groups from the Arabian Peninsula into Palestine. Many settled in three separate villages in the Wādī al-Khalīl, and their descendants later formed the majority of Hebron.<ref name="Büssow 2011 195">{{harvnb|Büssow|2011|p=195}}.</ref>

The Jewish community fluctuated between 8–10 families throughout the 16th century, and suffered from severe financial straits in the first half of the century.<ref>{{harvnb|David|2010|p=24}}. ''Tahrir'' registers document 20 households in 1538/9, 8 in 1553/4, 11 in 1562 and 1596/7.

In 1773 or 1775, a substantial amount of money was extorted from the Jewish community, who paid up to avert a threatened catastrophe, after a false allegation was made accusing them of having murdered the son of a local [[sheikh]] and throwing his body into a cesspit.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}> [[Meshulach|Emissaries]] from the community were frequently sent overseas to [[Halukka|solicit funds]].<ref>{{harvnb|Marcus|1996|p=85}}. In 1770, they received financial assistance from North American Jews, which amounted in excess of £100.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Van Luit|2009|p=42}}. In 1803, the rabbis and elders of the Jewish community were imprisoned after failing to pay their debts. In 1807, the community did succeed in purchasing a 5-[[dunam]] (5,000 m<sup>2</sup>) plot where Hebron's wholesale market stands today.</ref> During the Ottoman period, the dilapidated state of the patriarchs' tombs was restored to a semblance of sumptuous dignity.<ref>{{harvnb|Conder|1830|p=198}}.</ref> [[Ali Bey el Abbassi|Ali Bey]] who, under Muslim disguise, was one of the few Westerners to gain access, reported in 1807 that, <blockquote>all the sepulchres of the patriarchs are covered with rich carpets of green silk, magnificently embroidered with gold; those of the wives are red, embroidered in like manner. The sultans of Constantinople furnish these carpets, which are renewed from time to time. Ali Bey counted nine, one over the other, upon the sepulchre of Abraham.<ref>{{harvnb|Conder|1830|p=198}}.

For example, [[Ulrich Jasper Seetzen]] noted during his travels in Palestine in 1808–09 that 150 persons were employed in the glass industry in Hebron,<ref>{{harvnb|Schölch|1993|p=161}}.</ref> based on 26 [[kiln]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Büssow|2011|p=198}}</ref> In 1833, a report on the town appearing in a weekly paper printed by the London-based [[Religious Tract Society]] wrote that Hebron's population had 400 Arab families, had numerous well-provisioned shops and that there was a manufactory of glass lamps, which were exported to [[Egypt]].<ref>{{harvnb|WV|1833|p=436}}.</ref> Early 19th-century travellers also noticed Hebron's flourishing agriculture.

An [[1834 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab peasants' revolt]] broke out in April 1834 when [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt]] announced he would recruit troops from the local Muslim population.<ref>{{harvnb|Krämer|2011|p=68}}</ref> Hebron, headed by its [[nāẓir|nazir]] Abd ar-Rahman Amr, declined to supply its quota of conscripts for the army and suffered badly from the Egyptian campaign to crush the uprising.

In 1838, the total population was estimated at 10,000.<ref name="Robinson 88"/> When the government of Ibrahim Pasha fell in 1841, the local clan leader Abd ar-Rahman Amr once again resumed the reins of power as the Sheik of Hebron. Due to his extortionate demands for cash from the local population, most of the Jewish population fled to Jerusalem.<ref>{{harvnb|Schwarz|1850|pp=398–400}}</ref> In 1846, the Ottoman Governor-in-chief of Jerusalem (''serasker''), [[Kıbrıslı Mehmed Emin Pasha]], waged a campaign to subdue rebellious sheiks in the Hebron area, and while doing so, allowed his troops to sack the town. Though it was widely rumoured that he secretly protected Abd ar-Rahman,<ref>{{harvnb|Finn|1878|pp=287ff}}.</ref> the latter was deported together with other local leaders (such as Muslih al-'Azza of [[Bayt Jibrin]]), but he managed to return to the area in 1848.<ref>{{harvnb|Schölch|1993|pp=234–35}}.</ref>

According to Hillel Cohen, the attacks on Jews in this particular period are an exception that proves the rule, that one of the easiest place for Jews to live in the world were in the various countries of the Ottoman Empire. In the mid-eighteenth century, [[Abraham Gershon of Kitov|rabbi Abraham Gershon]] of [[Kuty|Kitov]] wrote from Hebron that:"the gentiles here very much love the Jews. When there is a ''brit milah'' (circumcision ceremony) or any other celebration, their most important men come at night and rejoice with the Jews and clap hands and dance with the Jews, just like the Jews'."{{sfn|Cohen|2015|p=15}}

The British [[Occupied Enemy Territory Administration|occupied]] Hebron on December 8, 1917; governance transited to a [[Mandatory Palestine|mandate]] in 1920. Most of Hebron was owned by old Islamic charitable endowments (''[[waqf]]s''), with about 60% of all the land in and around Hebron belonging to the Tamīm al-Dārī waqf.<ref>{{harvnb|Kupferschmidt|1987|pp=110–11}}.</ref> In 1922, its population stood at 16,577, of which 16,074 (97%) were Muslim, 430 (2.5%) were Jewish and 73 (0.4%) were Christian.<ref>[[:File:J.

===Jordanian period===
[[File:Hebron- 1960's.jpg|thumb|Hebron in the 1960s under Jordanian rule]]
At the beginning of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], Egypt took control of Hebron. Between May and October, Egypt and Jordan tussled for dominance in Hebron and its environs. Both countries appointed military governors in the town, hoping to gain recognition from Hebron officials. The Egyptians managed to persuade the pro-Jordanian mayor to support their rule, at least superficially, but local opinion turned against them when they imposed taxes. Villagers surrounding Hebron resisted and skirmishes broke out in which some were killed.<ref>Benny Morris. [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1860649890 ''The Road to Jerusalem: Glubb Pasha, Palestine and the Jews'']. 2003. pp. 186–87.</ref> By late 1948, part of the Egyptian forces from Bethlehem to Hebron had been cut off from their lines of supply and [[John Bagot Glubb|Glubb Pasha]] sent 350 [[Arab Legion]]naires and an armoured car unit to Hebron to reinforce them there. When the [[1949 Armistice Agreements|Armistice]] was signed, the city thus fell under [[Rule of the West Bank and East Jerusalem by Jordan|Jordanian military control]]. The armistice agreement between Israel with Jordan intended to allow Israeli Jewish pilgrims to visit Hebron, but, as Jews of all nationalities were forbidden by Jordan into the country, this did not occur.<ref>Thomas A Idinopulos, Jerusalem, 1994, p. 300, "So severe were the Jordanian restrictions against Jews gaining access to the old city that visitors wishing to cross over from west Jerusalem...had to produce a baptismal certificate."</ref><ref>Armstrong, Karen, ''Jerusalem: One City, Three Faiths'', 1997, "Only clergy, diplomats, UN personnel, and a few privileged tourists were permitted to go from one side to the other. The Jordanians required most tourists to produce baptismal certificates—to prove they were not Jewish ... ."</ref>

In December 1948, the [[Jericho Conference]], held by Jordan, was convened to decide the future of the West Bank. Hebron notables, headed by mayor [[Muhammad Ali Ja'abari|Muhamad 'Ali al-Ja'bari]], voted in favour of becoming part of [[Jordan]] and to recognise [[Abdullah I of Jordan]] as their king. The subsequent unilateral annexation benefited the Arabs of Hebron, who during the 1950s, played a significant role in the economic development of Jordan.<ref>{{harvnb|Robins|2004|pp=71–72}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Michael Dumper|author2=Bruce E.

===Israeli occupation===
[[File:Hebron105.JPG|thumb|Constructed in 1893, this former Jewish clinic in central Hebron now forms part of an Israeli settlement.]]

After the [[Six-Day War]] in June 1967, Israel [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|occupied]] Hebron along with the rest of the [[West Bank]], establishing a [[Israeli Military Governorate|military government]] to rule the area. In an attempt to reach a [[land for peace]] deal, [[Yigal Allon]] proposed that Israel annex 45% of the West Bank and return the remainder to Jordan.<ref>{{harvnb|Gorenberg|2007|pp=80–83}}.</ref> According to the [[Allon Plan]], the city of Hebron would lie in Jordanian territory, and in order to determine Israel's own border, Allon suggested building a Jewish settlement adjacent to Hebron.<ref>{{harvnb|Gorenberg|2007|pp=138–39}}</ref> [[David Ben-Gurion]] also considered that Hebron was the one sector of the conquered territories that should remain under Jewish control and be open to Jewish settlement.<ref>{{harvnb|Sternhell|1999|p=333}}</ref> Apart from its symbolic message to the international community that Israel's rights in Hebron were, according to Jews, inalienable,<ref>{{harvnb|Sternhell|1999|p=337}}: "In building this new Jewish town, one was sending a message to the international community: for the Jews, the sites connected with Jewish history are inalienable, and if later, for circumstantial reasons, the state of Israel is obliged to give one or another of them up, the step is not considered final."</ref> settling Hebron also had theological significance in some quarters.<ref>{{harvnb|Gorenberg|2007|p=151}}: "David's kingdom was a model for the [[Apocalyptic literature|messianic kingdom]]. David began in Hebron, so settling Hebron would lead to final redemption."</ref> For some, the capture of Hebron by Israel had unleashed a messianic fervor.<ref>{{harvnb|Segev|2008|p=698}}: "Hebron was considered a holy city; the massacre of Jews there in 1929 was imprinted on [[national memory]] along with the great pogroms of Eastern Europe. The messianic fervor that characterized the Hebron settlers was more powerful than the awakening that led people to settle in East Jerusalem: while Jerusalem had already been annexed, the future of Hebron was still unclear."</ref>

90% of the shoes in Palestine are now estimated to come from China, which Palestinian industry workers say are of much lower quality but also much cheaper,<ref name="AJShoe" /> and the Chinese are more aesthetic.

Under the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] passed by the UN in 1947, Hebron was envisaged to become part of an Arab state. While the Jewish leaders accepted the partition plan, the Arab leadership (the [[Arab Higher Committee]] in Palestine and the [[Arab League]]) rejected it, opposing any partition.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Palestinian refugees in Jordan 1948–1957|last=Plascov|first=Avi|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7146-3120-2|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=daLPXTYcoewC}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Jerusalem question, 1917–1968|last=Bovis|first=H.

Following the Six-Day War of 1967, Israel occupied Hebron. In 1997, in accordance with the [[Protocol Concerning the Redeployment in Hebron|Hebron Agreement]], Israel withdrew from 80 per cent of Hebron, which was handed over to the Palestinian Authority. Palestinian police would assume responsibilities in Area H1 and Israel would retain control in Area H2.

An international unarmed observer force—the [[Temporary International Presence in Hebron]] (TIPH) was subsequently established to help the normalization of the situation and to maintain a buffer between the Palestinian Arab population of the city and the Jewish population residing in their enclave in the old city. The TIPH operates with the permission of the Israeli government, meeting regularly with the Israeli army and the [[Israeli Civil Administration]], and is granted free access throughout the city. In 2018, the TIPH came under criticism in Israel due to incidents where an employee was, according to the Israeli police, filmed puncturing the tires of the car of an [[Israeli settler]], and another instance where an observer was deported after slapped a settler boy.<ref name=20yrs />

The post-1967 settlement in Hebron was driven by theological doctrines from the [[Mercaz HaRav Kook]], which consider the [[Land of Israel]] and its people as holy, and believe that the messianic Age of [[Redemption (theology)|Redemption]] has arrived. Hebron holds special significance in this narrative, with traditions linking it to [[Abraham]], [[King David]], and the entrance to the [[Garden of Eden]].<ref name="Røislien">Hanne Eggen Røislien,  [http://www.ijcv.org/index.php/ijcv/article/view/14/14 "Living with Contradiction: Examining the Worldview of the Jewish Settlers in Hebron"]. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002002611/http://www.ijcv.org/index.php/ijcv/article/view/14/14|date=2015-10-02}} ''[[International Journal of Conflict and Violence]]''.

In 1948 under Jordanian rule, the remaining ruins were razed.<ref>{{harvnb|Auerbach|2009|pp=40, 45, 79}}</ref> The Avraham Avinu quarter was established next to the Vegetable and Wholesale Markets on [[Al-Shuhada Street]] in the south of the Old City. The vegetable market was closed by the Israeli military and some of the neighbouring houses were occupied by settlers and soldiers. Settlers started to take over the closed Palestinian stores, despite explicit orders of the Israeli Supreme Court that the settlers should vacate these stores and the Palestinians should be allowed to return.<ref name="AIC_2004_10-12" /> Beit Romano was built and owned by Yisrael Avraham Romano of [[Constantinople]] and served [[History of the Jews in Turkey|Sephardi Jews from Turkey]]. In 1901, a Yeshiva was established there with a dozen teachers and up to 60 students.<ref name="HebronJews" /> In 1982, Israeli authorities took over a Palestinian education office (Osama Ben Munqez School) and the adjacent bus station. The school was turned into a settlement, and the bus station into a military base against an order of the [[Israeli Supreme Court]].<ref name="AIC_2004_10-12" /> In 1807 the immigrant Sephardic Rabbi Haim Yeshua Hamitzri (Haim the [[Egyptian Jews|Jewish Egyptian]]) purchased 5 dunams on the outskirts of the city and in 1811 he signed a contract for a 99-year lease on a further 800 dunams of land, which included 4 plots in [[Tel Rumeida]]. The plots were administered by his descendant Haim Bajaio after Jews left Hebron. Settlers' claims to this land are based on these precedents, but are dismissed by the rabbi's heir.<ref>{{harvnb|Platt|2012|pp=79–80}}.</ref> In 1984, settlers established a caravan outpost there called Ramat Yeshai. In 1998, the government recognized it as a settlement, and in 2001 the [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Defence Minister]] approved the building of the first housing units.<ref name="AIC_2004_10-12" /> 

In 2012, Israel Defense Forces called for the immediate removal of a new settlement, because it was seen as a provocation.<ref>Levinson, Chaim.

Some Jewish traditions regarding [[Adam]] place him in Hebron after his expulsion from [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]. Another has [[Cain]] kill [[Abel]] there. A third has [[Adam and Eve]] buried in the cave of Machpelah.

According to Tamara Neuman, settlement by a community of Jewish religious fundamentalists has brought about three major changes by redesigning a Palestinian area in terms of biblical imagery and origins: remaking over these revamped religious sites to endow them with an innovative centrality to Jewish worship, that, she argues, effectively erases the [[diaspora|diasporic thrust]] of Jewish tradition; and writing out the overlapping aspects of Judaism, Christianity and Islam in such a way that the possibility of accommodation between the three intertwined traditions is eradicated, while the presence of Palestinians themselves is erased by violent methods.<ref>{{harvnb|Neuman|2018|p=5|ps=: "This narrowed or fundamentalist focus involves three further changes that are also useful for framing this study: the first is that religiously inscribed space, particularly the remaking of many Palestinian areas into a geography of biblical sites and origins, has been given a new significance in the construction of a distinct Jewish (settler) identity. Spatial reorganization has also resulted in a range of incremental practices included under the rubric of religion that link up with this process of inscription— including renaming, reenvisioning, and rebuilding. These practices in turn support and magnify resolute place-based attachments. The second shift is that these remade biblical sites, specifically in Hebron and within the Tomb of the Patriarchs itself, are being given a new centrality in Jewish observance, one that largely cancels out the exilic orientation of Jewish tradition. They give rise to a form of Jewish observance focusing on exact origins and specific graves to the exclusion of a more characteristic yearning for the messianic future. Third, the final change entails writing out the many historical convergences between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam reflected in the traditions themselves so as to eliminate possibilities for accommodating difference, while using Jewish observance and forms of direct violence in order to erase the presence of an existing Palestinian population."}}</ref>
