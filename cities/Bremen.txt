'''Bremen''' ([[Low German]] also: ''Breem'' or ''Bräm''), officially the '''City Municipality of Bremen''' ({{langx|de|Stadtgemeinde Bremen}}, {{IPA|de|ˈʃtatɡəˌmaɪndə ˈbʁeːmən|IPA|de-Bremen.ogg}}), is the capital of the [[States of Germany|German state]] of the [[Bremen (state)|Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]] ({{lang|de|Freie Hansestadt Bremen}}), a two-city-state consisting of the cities of Bremen and [[Bremerhaven]]. With about 577,000 inhabitants, the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] city is the [[List of cities in Germany by population|11th-largest city]] of Germany and the second-largest city in [[Northern Germany]] after [[Hamburg]].{{efn|Berlin is seen as East German}}

Bremen is the largest city on the [[River Weser]], the longest river flowing entirely in Germany, lying some {{cvt|60|km|mi|0}} upstream from its [[River mouth|mouth]] into the [[North Sea]] at [[Bremerhaven]], and is completely surrounded by the state of [[Lower Saxony]]. Bremen is the centre of the [[Northwest Metropolitan Region]], which also includes the cities of [[Oldenburg (city)|Oldenburg]] and Bremerhaven, and has a population of around 2.8 million people. Bremen is contiguous with the Lower Saxon towns of [[Delmenhorst]], [[Stuhr]], [[Achim]], [[Weyhe]], [[Schwanewede]] and [[Lilienthal, Lower Saxony|Lilienthal]]. There is an [[exclave]] of Bremen in Bremerhaven, the "Citybremian Overseas Port Area Bremerhaven" ({{lang|de|Stadtbremisches Überseehafengebiet Bremerhaven}}). Bremen is the fourth-largest city in the [[Low German]] dialect area after Hamburg, [[Dortmund]] and [[Essen]].

[[Ports of Bremen|Bremen's port]], together with the port of Bremerhaven at the mouth of the Weser, is the second-largest port in Germany after the [[Port of Hamburg]]. The [[Bremen Airport|airport of Bremen]] ({{lang|de|Flughafen Bremen "[[Hans Koschnick]]"}}) lies in the southern borough of Neustadt-Neuenland and is Germany's [[List of the busiest airports in Germany|12th-busiest airport]].

Bremen is a major cultural and economic hub of Northern Germany. The city is home to dozens of historical galleries and museums, ranging from historical sculptures to major art museums, such as the [[Overseas Museum, Bremen|Bremen Overseas Museum]] ({{lang|de|Übersee-Museum Bremen}}) or the [[Weserburg]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Museums and Galleries – bremen.de |url=https://www.bremen.de/culture-and-leisure/museums-and-galleries |website=www.bremen.de |access-date=2015-08-28 |archive-date=2017-08-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812021902/http://www.bremen.de/culture-and-leisure/museums-and-galleries |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Bremen City Hall]] and the [[Bremen Roland]] form the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] "Town Hall and Roland on the Marketplace of Bremen". Bremen is well-known through the [[Brothers Grimm|Brothers Grimm's]] [[fairy tale]] "[[Town Musicians of Bremen]]" ({{lang|de|Die Bremer Stadtmusikanten}}), and there is a statue dedicated to it in front of the city hall.

Bremen has a reputation as a working-class city.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bremen city report |url=https://www.academia.edu/759050 |access-date=2015-08-28}}{{dead link|date=February 2016}}</ref> The city is home to many multinationals and manufacturing companies headquartered in Bremen include [[Hachez]] chocolate and [[Vector Foiltec]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bremen – Made in Bremen |url=http://www.bremen.de/neu-in-bremen/welcome-commerce/made-in-bremen-en |website=www.bremen.de |access-date=2015-08-28 |archive-date=2015-09-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923194558/http://www.bremen.de/neu-in-bremen/welcome-commerce/made-in-bremen-en |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Bundesliga]] club [[SV Werder Bremen]] play in the [[Weserstadion]] on the bank of the Weser.

== History ==
{{Main|History of Bremen (city)}}
{{for timeline|Timeline of Bremen}}
[[File:Braun Bremen UBHD.jpg|thumb|left|16th century view of the city]]
For most of its 1,200 year history, Bremen was an independent city within the confederal jurisdiction of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Its governing merchants and [[guild]]s were at the centre of the [[Hanseatic League]] that sought to monopolise the [[North Sea]] and [[Baltic Sea]] trade. To enlarge and confirm its independence, the city had, until the [[Reformation]], to contend with the temporal power of [[Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen|the Church]], and after the [[Thirty Years' War]] with [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], the masters of the surrounding [[Bremen-Verden|Duchy of Bremen-Verden]]. [[George I of Great Britain|George 1 Louis]], the [[Electorate of Hanover|Elector of Hannover]] (and from 1714, [[King of Great Britain and Ireland]]) who in 1715 acquired Bremen-Verden, recognized Bremen as a free city in 1720.<ref name=eb/> The city was captured in 1806 and then annexed by [[First French Empire|France]] in 1810, before it regained independence in 1815.<ref name=eb>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Bremen (city)|volume=4|pages=493&ndash;494|date=1910|short=1}}</ref>

In 1871, Bremen was drawn by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] into the [[German Empire]]. With its new sea anchorage and wharves at Bremerhaven, it was the principal port of embarkation for German and central European emigrants to the Americas, and an [[entrepôt]] for Germany's late developing colonial trade. The [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] (NDL), founded in Bremen in 1857, became one of the world's leading shipping companies.

In the twentieth century, Bremen, a broadly [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|liberal]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|social-democratic]] city, lost its autonomy under the [[Nazi Germany|Hitler regime]]. During [[World War II]], it was the location of nine subcamps of the [[Neuengamme concentration camp]], mostly for French, Polish, Soviet and Jewish men and Jewish women.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kz-gedenkstaette-neuengamme.de/en/history/satellite-camps/satellite-camps/|title=Satellite camps|website=KZ-Gedenkstätte Neuengamme|access-date=8 July 2024}}</ref> After the war, in which almost two thirds of the city's fabric was destroyed, the autonomy was restored. Bremen became one of the founding {{lang|de|Bundesländer}} (or states) of the [[West Germany|Federal Republic (West Germany)]].

== Geography==
[[File:Weserhb2.jpg|thumb|View from the [[Stephanibrücke]] towards the city centre and cathedral]]
Bremen lies on both sides of the [[River Weser]], about {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=off}} upstream of its estuary on the [[North Sea]] and its transition to the Outer Weser by Bremerhaven. Opposite Bremen's ''Altstadt'' is the point where the "Middle Weser" becomes the "Lower Weser" and, from the area of Bremen's port, the river has been made navigable to ocean-going vessels. The region on the left bank of the Lower Weser, through which the [[Ochtum]] flows, is the Weser Marshes, the landscape on its right bank is part of the [[Elbe-Weser Triangle]]. The [[Lesum]], and its tributaries, the [[Wümme]] and [[Hamme (river)|Hamme]], the [[Schönebecker Aue]] and [[Blumenthaler Aue]], are the downstream tributaries of the Weser.

The city's municipal area is about {{convert|38|km|mi|abbr=off}} long and {{convert|16|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} wide. In terms of area, Bremen is the eleventh largest city in Germany; and in terms of population the second largest city in northwest Germany after Hamburg and the eleventh largest in the whole of Germany ''(see: [[List of cities in Germany]])''.{{Contradict-inline|date=August 2019}}

Bremen lies about {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=off}} east of the city of [[Oldenburg (city)|Oldenburg]], {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=off}} southwest of [[Hamburg]], {{convert|120|km|mi|abbr=off}} northwest of [[Hanover]], {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=off}} north of [[Minden]] and {{convert|105|km|mi|abbr=off}} northeast of [[Osnabrück]]. Part of [[Bremerhaven]]'s port territory forms an [[exclave]] of the City of Bremen.

=== Hills of Bremen ===
The inner city lies on a Weser dune, which reaches a natural height of 10.5 metres (34 feet, 6 inches) above sea level at [[Bremen Cathedral]]; its highest point, though, is 14.4 metres (47 feet, 3 inches) above sea level and lies to the east at the {{lang|de|[[Polizeihaus]]}}, ''Am Wall'' 196. The highest natural feature in the city of Bremen is 32.5 metres (107 feet) above sea level and lies in [[Friedehorst Park]] in the northwestern borough of Burglesum.<ref name="JB2016">{{cite web |title=Statistisches Jahrbuch 2016 |url=http://www.statistik.bremen.de/sixcms/media.php/13/Jb2016_pdfa.pdf |access-date=2017-07-04 |publisher=Statistisches Landesamt Bremen |archive-date=2022-01-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220121080223/https://www.statistik.bremen.de/sixcms/media.php/13/Jb2016_pdfa.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>{{rp|25}} As a result, Bremen has the lowest [[List of the highest points of the German states|high point of all the German states]].<ref>''100 schräge Fakten über diese Stadt''. In: [[Zitty]] 16/2012, p. 15.</ref>

=== Climate ===
Bremen has a moderate [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') due to its proximity to the North Sea coast and temperate maritime air masses that move in with the predominantly westerly winds from the Atlantic Ocean. However, periods in which continental air masses predominate may occur at any time of the year and can lead to heat waves in the summer and prolonged periods of frost in the winter. In general though, extremes are rare in Bremen and temperatures below {{convert|-15|C|F|1}} and above {{convert|35|C|F|1}} occur only once every couple of years. The record high temperature was {{convert|37.6|C|F|1}} on 9 August 1992, while the official record low temperature was {{convert|-23.6|C|F|1}} on 13 February 1940. On 13 October 2018, Bremen recorded its warmest October day on record with 28.6&nbsp;°C (83.4&nbsp;°F).<ref>{{cite web |title=Wetterrekorde |publisher=Wetterdienst.de |url=http://www.wetterdienst.de/Klima/Wetterrekorde/Deutschland/Temperatur/Min/ |language=de |access-date=2016-02-10 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092901/http://www.wetterdienst.de/Klima/Wetterrekorde/Deutschland/Temperatur/Min/ |url-status=live }}</ref> However, the astronomer [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers]] reported to have measured −27.3&nbsp;°C on 23 January 1823.<ref>-21,8&nbsp;[[Réaumur scale|°Ré]] reports Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers in a letter to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] from 6 February 1823, printed in: Carl Friedrich Gauß, Briefwechsel mit H.W.M. Olbers, Georg Olms Verlag, 1860 S.&nbsp;233 ({{Google Books|drllO1y2tTQC|page=233}}).</ref> Being at some distance from the main North Sea, Bremen still has a somewhat wider temperature range than [[Bremerhaven]] that is located on the mouth of Weser.

Average temperatures have risen continually over the last decades, leading to a {{convert|0.6|C-change}} rise in the mean annual temperature between 1961–90 and 1981–2010 reference periods. As in most parts of Germany, the year 2014 has been the warmest year on record averaging {{convert|11.1|C|F|1}}, making Bremen the second-warmest German state after Berlin in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wetter und Klima im Überblick |publisher=Deutscher Wetterdienst |url=http://www.dwd.de/bvbw/appmanager/bvbw/dwdwwwDesktop?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=dwdwww_menu2_presse&_nfls=false |language=de |access-date=2015-01-10 |archive-date=2015-08-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150826000938/http://www.dwd.de/bvbw/appmanager/bvbw/dwdwwwDesktop?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=dwdwww_menu2_presse&_nfls=false |url-status=live }}</ref> While Bremen is located in the comparatively cloudy northwestern part of Germany, there has been a significant increase in average sunshine hours over the last decades, especially in the months of April, May, and July, causing the annual mean to rise by 121 hours between the reference periods of 1961–90 and 1991–2020.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wetter und Klima im Überblick |publisher=Deutscher Wetterdienst |url=http://www.dwd.de/bvbw/appmanager/bvbw/dwdwwwDesktop?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=_dwdwww_klima_umwelt_klimadaten_deutschland&T82002gsbDocumentPath=Navigation%2FOeffentlichkeit%2FKlima__Umwelt%2FKlimadaten%2Fkldaten__kostenfrei%2Fkldat__D__mittelwerte__node.html%3F__nnn%3Dtrue |language=de |access-date=2015-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221615/http://www.dwd.de/bvbw/appmanager/bvbw/dwdwwwDesktop?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=_dwdwww_klima_umwelt_klimadaten_deutschland&T82002gsbDocumentPath=Navigation%2FOeffentlichkeit%2FKlima__Umwelt%2FKlimadaten%2Fkldaten__kostenfrei%2Fkldat__D__mittelwerte__node.html%3F__nnn%3Dtrue |archive-date=2015-09-23 |url-status=dead}}</ref> This trend has continued over the last 10 years (2011–2020), which average 1680 hours of sunshine, almost 200 hours more than in the international reference period of 1961–90.<ref>{{cite web |title=Datenbankabfrage ausgewählter DWD Stationen Deutschlands |url=http://sklima.de/datenbank.php |publisher=SKlima |language=de |access-date=2016-02-10 |archive-date=2016-01-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131173132/http://sklima.de/datenbank.php |url-status=live }}</ref> Nevertheless, especially the winters remain extremely gloomy by international standards with December averaging hardly more than one hour of sunshine (out of 7 astronomically possible) per day, a feature that Bremen shares with most of Germany and its neighbouring countries, though.

Precipitation is distributed fairly even around the year with a small peak in summer mainly due to convective precipitation, i.e. showers and thunderstorms. Snowfall and the period of snow cover are variable; whereas in some years, hardly any snow accumulation occurs, there has recently been a series of unusually snowy winters, peaking in the record year 2010 counting 84 days with a snow cover.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wetter im Rückblick |url=http://www.wetteronline.de/wetterdaten/bremen?pcid=pc_rueckblick_data&gid=10224&pid=p_rueckblick_diagram&sid=StationHistory&iid=10224&paraid=SNLD&period=52&month=12&year=2010 |publisher=wetteronline |language=de |access-date=2016-02-10 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304181505/http://www.wetteronline.de/wetterdaten/bremen?pcid=pc_rueckblick_data&gid=10224&pid=p_rueckblick_diagram&sid=StationHistory&iid=10224&paraid=SNLD&period=52&month=12&year=2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> Nevertheless, snow accumulation of more than 20 centimetres (8&nbsp;in) remains exceptional, the record being {{convert|68|cm|in|1}} of snow on 18 February 1979.

The warmest months in Bremen are June, July, and August, with average high temperatures of {{convert|20.2|to|22.6|C|F|1}}. The coldest are December, January, and February, with average low temperatures of {{convert|-1.1|to|0.3|C|F|1}}. Typical of its maritime location, autumn tends to remain mild well into October, while spring arrives later than in the southwestern parts of the country.

Bremen's economy boomed in line with the West German {{lang|de|[[Wirtschaftswunder]]}} of the 1950s and 60s. This saw the growth, and permanent settlement, of a large migrant worker population, drawn largely from [[Turkey]] and southern Europe. A new wave immigration occurred after the turn of new century, following the entry of [[Poland]], [[Bulgaria]] and other former [[Eastern Bloc|East Bloc]] countries into the [[European Union]], and after 2015 with the settlement of [[Refugees of the Syrian civil war|refugees from Syria]] and other war-torn regions. Today Bremen has a population of 567,000 and is the 11th largest city in Germany and 5th largest city by area with area of {{cvt|318.21|km2|sqmi}}, which makes this city area bigger than [[Munich]].

By the second decade of the century out of a population (including [[Bremerhaven]]) of approximately 680,000, over 115,000 had foreign citizenship,<ref name="JB2016" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Demographic statisticsRegion BREMEN, population density, population, average age, families, foreigners |url=https://ugeo.urbistat.com/AdminStat/en/de/demografia/dati-sintesi/bremen/4/2 |access-date=2021-05-19 |website=ugeo.urbistat.com |archive-date=2021-05-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210519124443/https://ugeo.urbistat.com/AdminStat/en/de/demografia/dati-sintesi/bremen/4/2 |url-status=live }}</ref> and nearly twice that number, almost a third of the total population, could be classified as having non-German origin/ethnicity.<ref>[http://www.bpb.de/nachschlagen/zahlen-und-fakten/soziale-situation-in-deutschland/61646/migrationshintergrund-i "Bevölkerung mit Migrationshintergrund I"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190519234001/https://www.bpb.de/nachschlagen/zahlen-und-fakten/soziale-situation-in-deutschland/61646/migrationshintergrund-i |date=2019-05-19 }}, (German).

The recent influx has somewhat moderated the tendency toward an accelerated ageing of the population. As it is, more than half the population of the state of Bremen are over 50, and more than a quarter are over 60.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bevölkerung in Bremen nach Altersgruppen |url=https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/1095807/umfrage/bevoelkerung-bremen-nach-altersgruppen/ |access-date=2021-05-19 |website=Statista |language=de |archive-date=2021-05-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210519130031/https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/1095807/umfrage/bevoelkerung-bremen-nach-altersgruppen/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Politics ==
The {{lang|de|Stadtbürgerschaft}} (municipal assembly) is currently made up of 72 of the 87 legislators of the state legislature, the {{lang|de|[[Bürgerschaft of Bremen|Bremische Bürgerschaft]]}} who reside in the city of Bremen. The legislature is elected by the citizens of Bremen every four years.

Bremen has a reputation as a [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] city. The port, shipyards and related industries sustained a large and unionised working class. This translated into support for the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]], considered Bremen's natural governing party. However, in the 1980s [[mechanization]] of the port and closure of the city's leading shipbuilder induced an employment crisis and shook the confidence of the party's traditional voter base. The SPD, which had still polled 51% in 1987, lost its effective majority. The once dominant left-liberal vote split, and coalition government became the norm.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Regions of Germany: A Reference Guide to History and Culture |url=https://archive.org/details/regionsofgermany0000buse |url-access=registration |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |date=2005-01-01 |isbn=978-0-313-32400-0 |first=Dieter K. |last=Buse}}</ref> The state today is governed by a coalition of the Social Democratic Party, [[Alliance 90/The Greens|The Greens]] and [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]].

In November 2019 the right-wing group Phalanx 18 was banned by the city-state of Bremen.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dw.com/en/bremen-bans-right-wing-group-phalanx-18/a-51331231 |title=Bremen bans right-wing group Phalanx 18 &#124; DW &#124; 20.11.2019 |website=[[Deutsche Welle]] |access-date=2021-09-18 |archive-date=2021-09-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210918102215/https://www.dw.com/en/bremen-bans-right-wing-group-phalanx-18/a-51331231 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Main sights ==
* Many of the sights in Bremen are found in the ''Altstadt'' (Old Town), an oval area surrounded by the [[Weser|Weser River]], on the southwest, and the {{lang|de|Wallgraben}}, the former moats of the medieval city walls, on the northeast. The oldest part of the Altstadt is the southeast half, starting with the {{lang|de|Marktplatz}} and ending at the ''[[Schnoor]] quarter''.
* The {{lang|de|[[Bremer Marktplatz|Marktplatz]]}} (Market square) is dominated by the opulent façade of the [[Town Hall of Bremen]]. The building was erected between 1405 and 1410 in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]], but the façade was built two centuries later (1609–12) in [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance style]]. The Town Hall is the seat of the president of the [[Senate of Bremen]]. Today, it hosts a restaurant in original decor with gigantic [[Oak (wine)|wine barrels]], the [[Bremen Ratskeller|Ratskeller in Bremen]]. In July 2004, along with the [[Bremen Roland]], the building was added to the list of [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]].
* Two statues stand to the west side of the Town Hall: one is the statue [[Bremen Roland]] (1404) of the city's protector, [[Roland]], with his view against the ''Cathedral'' and bearing Durendart, the "sword of justice" and a shield decorated with an [[German Empire|imperial eagle]]. The other near the entrance to the {{lang|de|Ratskeller}} is [[Gerhard Marcks]]' [[bronze sculpture]] (1953) {{lang|de|Die Stadtmusikanten}} ([[Town Musicians of Bremen|Town Musicians]]), which portrays the donkey, dog, cat and rooster of the [[Brothers Grimm|Grimm Brothers']] fairy tale.
* Other interesting buildings in the vicinity of the Marktplatz are the {{lang|de|[[Schütting (Bremen)|Schütting]]}}, a sixteenth-century Flemish-inspired guild hall, [[Rathscafé (Bremen)|Rathscafé]], [[Raths-Apotheke (Bremen)|Raths-Apotheke]], [[Haus der Stadtsparkasse (Bremen)|Haus der Stadtsparkasse]] and the {{lang|de|[[Stadtwaage (Bremen)|Stadtwaage]]}}, the former [[weigh house]] (built in 1588), with an ornate Renaissance façade, and the nearby [[Essighaus]], once a fine Renaissance town house. The façades and houses surrounding the market square were the first buildings in Bremen to be restored after [[World War II]], by the citizens of Bremen themselves.
* St Peter's [[Bremen Cathedral|Cathedral]] (13th century), to the east of the Marktplatz, with sculptures of [[Moses]] and [[David]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] and Charlemagne. The [[Bismarck monument (Bremen)|Bismarck Monument]] is also outside the cathedral, which is the only monument in Germany to depict Otto von Bismarck in an equestrian format.
* On Katherinenklosterhof to the northwest of the cathedral, a few remaining traces can be found of [[St Catherine's Monastery, Bremen|St Catherine's Monastery]] dating back to the thirteenth century.
* The {{lang|de|[[Church of Our Lady (Bremen)|Liebfrauenkirche]]}} (Our Lady's Church) is the oldest church of the town (11th century). Its crypt features several impressive murals from the fourteenth century.
* Off the south side of the Markplatz, the {{cvt|110|m|yd}} {{lang|de|[[Böttcherstraße]]}} was transformed in 1923–1931 by the coffee magnate [[Ludwig Roselius]], who commissioned local artists to convert the narrow street (in medieval times, the street of the barrel makers) into an inspired mixture of [[Gothic art|Gothic]] and [[Art Nouveau]]. It was considered "{{lang|de|entartete Kunst}}" ([[degenerate art]]) by the Nazis. Today, the street is one of Bremen's most popular attractions, with the [[Glockenspiel House]] at No. 4 with its [[carillon]] of [[Meissen porcelain]] bells.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boettcherstrasse.de/index.php?page=/94&aid=&lang_id=2 |title=Böttcherstraße: Welcome |publisher=Böttcherstraße GmbH |access-date=27 January 2014 |archive-date=11 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111191833/http://www.boettcherstrasse.de/index.php?page=/94&aid=&lang_id=2 |url-status=live }}</ref>
* At the end of Böttcherstraße, by the Weser bank, stands the {{lang|de|Martinikirche}} (St Martin's Church), a Gothic brick church built in 1229, and rebuilt in 1960 after its destruction in World War II.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bremen-tourism.de/563453ec-a72a-185c-32ec-68aafd057bdb |title=St. Martin's Church |publisher=Bremen-tourism.de |access-date=14 January 2014 |archive-date=15 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115091231/http://www.bremen-tourism.de/563453ec-a72a-185c-32ec-68aafd057bdb |url-status=dead}}</ref>
