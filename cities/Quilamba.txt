'''Quilamba''' (or '''Kilamba''') is an [[Angola]]n neighborhood that serves as the administrative center of [[Belas, Luanda|Belas Municipality]] and a large housing development site 30&nbsp;km (18 miles) from [[Luanda]], the capital city of [[Angola]]. It is being built by the [[China International Trust and Investment Corporation]].

Quilamba covers an area of 30.5 km2 and will eventually offer homes for more than 200,000 inhabitants. It comprises about 750 apartment blocks ranging from 5 to 13 floors, over 100 commercial premises, 17 schools and 24 daycare centers to provide care and education for children, as well as over 240 stores to drive the local economy. The cost is reported at US$3.5 billion, financed by a [[China|Chinese]] [[Line of credit|credit line]] and repaid by the Angolan government with oil.

== History ==
After the conclusion of [[Angolan Civil War|Angola's civil war]] in 2002, the government began developing housing projects and satellite towns to meet the housing demands of a population which had largely lived in informal settlements.<ref name=":Curtis&Klaus">{{Cite book |last1=Curtis |first1=Simon |title=The Belt and Road City: Geopolitics, Urbanization, and China's Search for a New International Order |last2=Klaus |first2=Ian |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |isbn=9780300266900 |location=New Haven and London |publication-date=2024 |doi=10.2307/jj.11589102 |jstor=jj.11589102}}</ref>{{Rp|page=125}}

Quilamba contributed to meeting the election pledge made by President [[Jose Eduardo dos Santos]] in 2008 to build a million new homes in four years. Development of Quilamba began in 2008.<ref name=":Curtis&Klaus" />{{Rp|page=125}} As part of an exchange of Chinese construction materials and expertise for Angolan natural resources, [[CITIC Group]] Corporation Ltd. (a [[State-owned enterprises of China|Chinese state-owned enterprise]]) led the development of Quilamba.<ref name=":Curtis&Klaus" />{{Rp|page=125}}

The government planned to use some of the residential blocks as [[social housing]]. {{As of|July 2012}}, the buildings were largely complete but still unoccupied.<ref name="ghost-town">{{cite news|title=Footage shows African 'ghost town'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18680217|access-date=4 July 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=2 July 2012|author=Louise Redvers}}</ref> Despite a slow start, legislation signed into law by dos Santos resulted in a massive boom in demand.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sandle |first=Adam |title=Kilamba: New Initiatives Create Massive Demand |url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-954602 |access-date=12 April 2013 |publisher=CNN iReport}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Hammer |first=Derek |title=Kilamba, from 0 to 200,000 inhabitants in 3 years |url=http://www.merinews.com/article/kilamba-from-0-to-200000-inhabitants-in-3-years/15871400.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701225849/http://www.merinews.com/article/kilamba-from-0-to-200000-inhabitants-in-3-years/15871400.shtml |archive-date=1 July 2012 |access-date=12 April 2013 |publisher=Merinews}}</ref>
