'''Quetzaltenango''' ({{IPA|es|ketsalteˈnaŋɡo}}, also known by its Maya name '''Xelajú''' {{IPA-myn|ʃelaˈχu|}} or '''Xela''' {{IPA|[ˈʃela]}}) is both the seat of the [[Quetzaltenango Department|namesake Department]] and [[Municipalities of Guatemala|municipality]], in [[Guatemala]]. The city is located in a mountain valley at an elevation of {{convert|2,330|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] at its lowest part. It may reach above {{cvt|2,400|m}} within the city.

The Municipality of Quetzaltenango consists of an area of {{cvt|122|km2}}. Municipalities abutting the municipality of Quetzaltenango include [[Salcajá]], [[Cantel, Guatemala|Cantel]], [[Almolonga, Quetzaltenango|Almolonga]], [[Zunil]], [[El Palmar, Quetzaltenango|El Palmar]], [[Concepción Chiquirichapa]], [[San Mateo, Quetzaltenango|San Mateo]], [[La Esperanza, Quetzaltenango|La Esperanza]], and [[Olintepeque]] in Quetzaltenango department and [[San Andrés Xecul]] in [[Totonicapán]] department.

==History==
[[File:Escudoaltos 2014-06-16 06-59.jpg|left|thumb|Coat of arms of [[Los Altos, Central America|Los Altos]], carved in stone on the grave of heroes in the Cemetery]]
In [[pre-Columbian]] times, Quetzaltenango was a city of the [[Mam language|Mam]] [[Maya people]] called Xelajú, although by the time of the [[Spanish Conquest]] it had become part of the [[K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj]]{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}. The name may be derived from ''xe laju' noj'' meaning "under ten mountains". The city was said to have already been over 300 years old when the Spanish first arrived. With the help of his [[Indian auxiliaries|allies]], [[Conquistador]] [[Pedro de Alvarado]] defeated and killed the Maya ruler [[Tecún Umán]] here{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}.

When Alvarado conquered the city for Spain in the 1520s, he called it by the [[Nahuatl]] name used by his Central Mexican Indian allies, "Quetzaltenango", generally considered to mean "the place of the [[Resplendent quetzal|quetzal]] bird." Quetzaltenango became the city's official name in colonial times{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}. However, many people (especially the indigenous population) continue to call the city "Xelajú" or more commonly "Xela" for short, and some proudly, but unofficially, consider it the "capital of the Mayas".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Quetzaltenango –Xela o Xelajú, Quetzaltenango {{!}} Lugares turísticos, Historia y Cómo Llegar |url=https://www.guatevalley.com/municipio/quetzaltenango-%E2%80%93xela-o-xelaju-quetzaltenango |access-date=2023-03-25 |website=www.guatevalley.com}}</ref>[[File:Quetzaltenango Parque Central c.1894.png|thumb|left|Quetzaltenango central park c. 1894]]

From 1838 to 1840 Quetzaltenango was the capital of the state of [[Los Altos, Central America|Los Altos]], one of the states or provinces of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]]. As the union broke up, the army of  [[Rafael Carrera]] conquered Quetzaltenango making it part of Guatemala. In 1850, the city had a population of approximately 20,000.<ref name=Baily1>{{cite book|last=Baily|first=John|title=Central America; Describing Each of the States of Guatemala, Honduras, Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica|year=1850|publisher=Trelawney Saunders|location=London|pages=84–85|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7306/view/1/84/}}</ref>

During the 19th century, [[coffee]] was introduced as a major crop in the area. As a result, the economy of Xela prospered{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}. Much fine [[Belle Époque]] architecture can still be found in the city.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

On October 24, 1902, at 5:00 pm, the [[Santa María (volcano)|Santa María Volcano]] erupted. Rocks and ash fell on Quetzaltenango at 6 PM, only one hour after the eruption.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

In the 1920s, a young [[Romani people|Romani]] woman named Vanushka Cardena Barajas died and was buried in the Xela city cemetery. An active legend has developed around her tomb that says those who bring flowers or write a request on her tomb will be reunited with their former romantic partners. The Guatemalan songwriter Alvaro Aguilar wrote a song based on this legend.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

In 1930 the only electric railway in Guatemala, the ''[[Ferrocarril de Los Altos]]'', was inaugurated. It was built by [[AEG (German company)|AEG]] and [[Krupp]] and had 14 train cars. The track connected Quetzaltenango with [[San Felipe, Retalhuleu|San Felipe]], [[Retalhuleu]]. It was soon destroyed by mudslides and finally demolished in 1933. The people of Quetzaltenango are still very proud of the railway. A [[List of railway museums|railway museum]] has been established in the city center.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

Since the late 1990s Quetzaltenango has been having an economic boom, which makes it the city with the second-highest contribution to the Guatemalan economy{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}. With its first high-rise buildings being built, it is expected by 2015{{update inline|date=January 2022}} to have a more prominent skyline, with buildings up to 15 floors tall.
 
In 2008, the Central American Congress [[PARLACEN]] announced that every September 15, Quetzaltenango will be [[Central America]]'s capital of culture.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.guatelog.com/log/576/Historia-de-Quetzaltenango.html |title=GuateLog - ''Historia de Quetzaltenango''<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2011-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082213/http://www.guatelog.com/log/576/Historia-de-Quetzaltenango.html |archive-date=2012-04-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Quetzaltenango was supposed to host  [[2018 Central American and Caribbean Games]] but dropped out due to a lack of funding for the event.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120630140632/http://www.notisistema.com/noticias/?p=464027 notisistema.com]; ''Ciudad guatemalteca, candidata para Juegos Centroamericanos y del Caribe 2018.''</ref>

In March 2022, indigenous activists began blockading the central waste deposit near Valle de Palajunoj to protest a [[:es:Plan de Ordenamiento Territorial| city development plan]] enacted by the municipal authorities in June 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Escobar |first1=Gilberto |url=https://amerika21.de/blog/2022/04/257520/guatemala-blockaden-im-valle-de-palajuno |title=Guatemala: Ein Tag bei den Blockaden im Valle de Palajunoj |translator-last=Austen |translator-first=Thorben |work=amerika21 |language=German |publisher=Mondial21 e.

==Economy==
Historically, the city produced [[wheat]], [[maize]], fruits, and vegetables. It also had a healthy [[livestock]] industry. Livestock was exported throughout the country and to [[El Salvador]]. As of 1850, wheat was the largest export, followed by [[Theobroma cacao|cacao]], [[sugar]], [[wool]] and [[cotton]].<ref name=Baily1/>

== Sports ==
Quetzaltenango is home to the [[Club Xelajú MC]] soccer team. The team competes at [[Estadio Mario Camposeco]] which has a capacity of 13,500 and is the most successful non-capital team in the [[Liga Nacional de Fútbol de Guatemala]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mixelajumc.com/historia/ |title=La historia de un grande del fútbol nacional |website=mixelajumc.com |url-status=unfit |archive-date=2007-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514064854/http://www.mixelajumc.com/historia/}}</ref>

Due to the city's high altitude many athletes have prepared themselves here such as Olympic silver medalist [[Erick Barrondo]] and the 2004 Cuban volleyball team.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}

The swimming team has enjoyed success in national and international events.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}

Quetzaltenango withdrew from hosting the [[2018 Central American and Caribbean Games]]. It planned to build a 30,000-seat stadium by 2016, as well seven new facilities for indoor sports and aquatics.<ref>[http://noticias.emisorasunidas.com/noticias/nacionales/xela-presenta-candidatura-para-realizar-juegos-centroamericanos-y-del-caribe-201 noticias.emisorasunidas.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323144800/http://noticias.emisorasunidas.com/noticias/nacionales/xela-presenta-candidatura-para-realizar-juegos-centroamericanos-y-del-caribe-201 |date=2012-03-23 }}; ''Xela presenta candidatura para realizar Juegos Centroamericanos y del Caribe 2018.

==Transportation==
[[File:Cuatro Caminos Guatemala.JPG|thumb|The ''Cuatro Caminos'' intersection is outside the city.]]
The city has a system of micro-buses for quick and cheap movement. A micro-bus is essentially a large van stuffed with seats. Micro-buses are numbered based on the route they take (e.g., "''Ruta 7''"). There is no government-run mass transport system in the city. The sole public means of transport is the bus or micro-buses. Transportation to other cities is provided by bus. Bicycling is a way to get around and to travel to (and in) rural areas. [[Quetzaltenango Airport]] provides air service to the city.
