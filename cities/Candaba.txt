[[File:Standrewjf.JPG|thumbnail|right|Candaba market]]
The Candaba Swamp (Pinac, Pinak) absorbs most of the flood waters that flow from the western slopes of the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre Mountain Range]]. During the [[Wet season|rainy season]], the [[Pampanga River]] overflows and the swamp is submerged. But it is relatively dry during the [[dry Season]], hence making the land suitable for a variety agricultural production.

Candaba is noted for its production [[Cucumis melo|melon]], that are sold worldwide.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The swamps are communal fishing grounds encompassing some 430&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of highly arable farmlands. Candaba swamps are very fertile due to its sustained deposits of [[humus]] and decaying plant residues. Migrant wild ducks and various wildlife bird from [[Siberia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Mongolia]] and other parts of [[Asia]] use Candaba as their yearly sanctuary.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}{{clear-left}}

==Infrastructure==
;Drainage System
Candaba-San Miguel road is known for being flooded when a typhoon hits Candaba. The drainage system or ''rip-rap'', which is a part of Mayor Jerry Pelayo's road cementing project, was built on both sides of every cemented roads made so the rainwater from other parts of Pampanga will just flow on it and not on the road.
[[File:San_Agustine_Bridge_Malisik_River_Views5.jpg|150px|thumbnail|right|Malisik River-New San Agustin Bridge in 2024]]
===Transportation===
[[Public transport]] is mainly done by means of [[jeepneys]] and [[tricycles]]. Jeepneys have their routes as an itinerary route for various places. Candaba-San Miguel road or ''pinak'' was fully cemented by 2014.

===Telecommunication facilities===
Candabas telecommunication facilities and telephone services are provided by the [[Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company]] (PLDT), [[Digital Telecommunications Philippines|PSE.DGTL]], [[Datelcom]], [[Evangelista Telephone Company]] and the [[Pampanga Telecom Company]].

In January 2008, a [[Philippine]] record of 17,000 birds (in the 24-hour count) visited the 32,000-[[hectare]] [[Candaba Swamp]], sanctuary for migratory birds. There are 80 species of [[bird migration|migratory]] birds were sighted at the 100-hectare fishpond of Mayor Jerry Pelayo in Barangay Doña Simang and in Barangay Paralaya. The rare birds spotted were: the Shrenck's bittern, [[great bittern]], [[gadwall]], [[coot]], Philippine [[mallard]] or ducks, and [[Eurasian spoonbill]] (''Platalea leucorodia''). Robert S. Kennedy's book ''A Guide to the Birds of the Philippines'' lists endemic and migratory birds which visit the Philippines. Pelayo organized the Ibon-Ebon Festival (“birds and eggs”) on February 1–2. The WBCP recorded three rare species in Candaba [[swamp]]: the [[purple swamphen]] (''Porphyrio porphyrio''), Chinese pond heron (''[[Ardeola bacchus]]'') and the black-crowned night heron (''[[Nycticorax nycticorax]]'').<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20080113-112109/17000-birds-sighted-in-Candaba-swamp# |title=17,000 birds sighted in Candaba swamp |access-date=2008-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201174915/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20080113-112109/17000-birds-sighted-in-Candaba-swamp# |archive-date=2008-02-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
