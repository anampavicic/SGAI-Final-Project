==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Fargo, North Dakota}}

===Early history===
Historically part of [[Sioux]] ([[Dakota people|Dakota]]) territory, the area that is present-day Fargo was an early stopping point for [[steamboat]]s traversing the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] during the 1870s and 1880s. The city was originally named "Centralia", but was later renamed "Fargo" after [[Northern Pacific Railway]] director and [[Wells Fargo Express Company]] founder [[William Fargo]] (1818–1881).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fargo is Founded {{!}} Fargo History |url=https://library.ndsu.edu/fargo-history/?q=content/fargo-founded |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221112200153/https://library.ndsu.edu/fargo-history/?q=content/fargo-founded |archive-date=November 12, 2022 |access-date=August 11, 2023 |website=library.ndsu.edu}}</ref> During the initial settlement of Fargo, there developed two cities: one (unofficially) called "Fargo on the Prairie" and the other "Fargo in the Timber". "Fargo on the Prairie" was known for being well run by Northern Pacific engineers, while "Fargo in the Timber" remained mostly lawless and full of apparently "desperate and reckless characters", according to [[The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead]]. Eventually, "Fargo in the Timber" would see its demise after a crackdown by federal authorities, and the modern Fargo would develop out of "Fargo on the Prairie".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Crossing the Red River: Fargo Begins {{!}} Fargo History |url=https://library.ndsu.edu/fargo-history/?q=content/crossing-red-river-fargo-begins |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230629020520/https://library.ndsu.edu/fargo-history/?q=content/crossing-red-river-fargo-begins |archive-date=June 29, 2023 |access-date=August 11, 2023 |website=library.ndsu.edu |publisher=[[North Dakota State University]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Kerzman |first=Kristopher |date=January 7, 2016 |title=Throwback Thursday: Fargo in the Timber home to the 'reckless,' 'lawless' |url=https://www.inforum.com/newsmd/throwback-thursday-fargo-in-the-timber-home-to-the-reckless-lawless |access-date=August 11, 2023 |website=InForum |publisher=[[The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead]] |language=en}}</ref> The area started to flourish after the arrival of the Northern Pacific Railroad and the city became known as the "Gateway to the West."

During the 1880s, Fargo became the "divorce capital" of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] because of lenient divorce laws.<ref>Riley, G (1991). Divorce: An American Tradition. Oxford University Press</ref> A major fire struck the city on June 7, 1893, destroying 31 blocks of downtown Fargo, but the city was immediately rebuilt with new buildings made of brick, new streets, and a water system. More than 246 new buildings were built within one year. There were several rumors concerning the cause of the fire.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.ndsu.edu/fargo-history/?q=content/fire-1893|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705072024/http://library.ndsu.edu/fargo-history/?q=content%2Ffire-1893|title=Fire of 1893 &#124; Fargo History|archive-date=July 5, 2015|website=library.ndsu.edu}}</ref>

The North Dakota Agricultural College was founded in 1890 as [[North Dakota]]'s [[land-grant university]], becoming first accredited by the [[North Central Association]] in 1915. In 1960, NDAC became known as [[North Dakota State University]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=History and Traditions {{!}} North Dakota State University |url=https://www.ndsu.edu/history_traditions |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220320041104/https://www.ndsu.edu/history_traditions |archive-date=March 20, 2022 |access-date=August 11, 2023 |website=www.ndsu.edu}}</ref>

===Recent history===

Fargo has continued to expand rapidly but steadily. Since the mid-1980s, the bulk of new residential growth has occurred in the south and southwest zones of the area (for example in [[West Fargo, North Dakota|West Fargo]])  due to geographic constraints on the north side.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The City of Fargo - Find Your Neighborhood |url=https://fargond.gov/live/know-your-neighborhood/find-your-neighborhood |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230202021553/https://www.fargond.gov/live/know-your-neighborhood/find-your-neighborhood |archive-date=February 2, 2023 |access-date=August 13, 2023 |website=fargond.gov}}</ref> The city's major retail districts on the southwest side have likewise seen rapid development.

Downtown Fargo has been [[Gentrification|gentrified]] due in part to investments by the city and private developers in the Renaissance Zone.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Downtown gentrification: the good, the bad, and the unaffordable |url=https://hpr1.com/index.php/arts-entertainment/arts/downtown-gentrification-the-good-the-bad-and-the-unaffordable |access-date=August 11, 2023 |website=High Plains Reader, Fargo ND |language=en}}</ref> Most older neighborhoods, such as Horace Mann, have either avoided decline or been revitalized through housing rehabilitation promoted by planning agencies to strengthen the city's core.

[[North Dakota State University|NDSU]] has grown rapidly into a major research university and forms a major component of the city's identity and economy.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Study: NDSU has major impact on region's economy {{!}} North Dakota State University |url=https://www.ndsu.edu/news/view/detail/29367 |access-date=August 13, 2023 |website=www.ndsu.edu}}</ref> Most students live off-campus in the surrounding Roosevelt neighborhood. The university has established a presence downtown through both academic buildings and apartment housing. In addition, [[North Dakota State Bison football|NDSU Bison Football]] has gained a significant following among many area residents. In recent years, Fargo has also become a regional technology and healthcare hub, as a result of [[Microsoft]] and [[Sanford Health]] both building regional campuses in the city center.<ref>{{Cite web |date=July 9, 2019 |title=What's behind Fargo-Moorhead's boom? |url=https://www.minnpost.com/economy/2019/07/whats-behind-fargo-moorheads-boom/ |access-date=August 13, 2023 |publisher=[[MinnPost]] |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:FEMA - 40347 - Flooded neighborhood in Fargo, North Dakota.jpg|thumb|left|Spring flooding in Riverview area of Fargo, 2009]]

Fargo is a core city of the [[Fargo metropolitan area|Fargo-Moorhead, ND–MN Combined Statistical Area]], which also includes Moorhead, West Fargo, and Dilworth and outlying communities.

Fargo sits on the western bank of the [[Red River of the North]] in a flat geographic region known as the [[Red River Valley]]. The Red River Valley resulted from the withdrawal of [[glacier|glacial]] [[Lake Agassiz]], which drained away about 9,300 years ago. The lake sediments deposited from Lake Agassiz made the land around Fargo some of the richest in the world for agricultural uses.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Handy |first=Barbara |title=Lessons from Lake Agassiz {{!}} State Historical Society of North Dakota Blog |url=https://blog.statemuseum.nd.gov/blog/lake-agassiz |access-date=August 19, 2023 |website=[[State Historical Society of North Dakota]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Bluemle |first=John P. |title=Glacial Lake Agassiz |url=https://www.dmr.nd.gov/ndgs/ndnotes/agassiz/ |url-status= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230201133951/https://www.dmr.nd.gov/ndgs/ndnotes/agassiz/ |archive-date=February 1, 2023 |access-date=August 19, 2023 |website=North Dakota Geological Survey}}</ref>

Seasonal floods due to the rising water of the Red River, which flows from the United States into [[Lake Winnipeg]] in Manitoba, Canada, have presented challenges. The Red flows northward, which means melting snow and river ice, as well as runoff from its tributaries, often create ice dams causing the river to overflow. Fargo's surrounding Red River Valley terrain is essentially flat, leading to overland flooding. Since the potentially devastating [[2009 Red River flood]], both Fargo and Moorhead have taken great strides in flood protection; only a near-record flood would cause concern today. Work on the [[FM Diversion]] has begun and upon completion, it will permanently floodproof the metro for 500-year floods.

Its location makes the city vulnerable to flooding during seasons with above-average precipitation. The Red River's minor flood stage in Fargo begins at a level of 18 feet, with major flooding categorized at 30 feet and above. Many major downtown roadways and access to Moorhead are closed off at this level. Record snowfalls late in 1996 led to flooding in 1997, causing the Red to rise to a record crest of 39.5 feet, nearly overtaking city defenses. In 2008–2009, significant fall precipitation coupled with rapid snowmelt in March 2009 caused the Red to rise to a new record level of 40.84 feet, but again Fargo remained safe, in large part due to flood mitigation efforts instituted after the 1997 event and sandbagging efforts by the city residents. Further upgrades were made to city infrastructure and additional resources brought to bear following the 2009 flood, which caused no issues for the city in 2010 despite another rapid melt that caused the Red to rise to 37 feet (which ranks among the top-ten highest levels ever recorded). The estimated $1.5 billion FM diversion project is under construction and will channel the Red's water away from the city. As of 2012, Fargo has bought 700 houses in flood-prone areas.<ref>[http://www.wday.com/event/article/id/71153/ Fargo lifts the ban on building permits in flood-prone areas | WDAY | Fargo, ND] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130217004320/http://www.wday.com/event/article/id/71153/ |date=February 17, 2013}}.

===Climate===
Because of its location in the [[Great Plains]] and its distance from both mountains and oceans, Fargo has an extreme [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb'', bordering on ''Dwb''), featuring long, bitterly cold winters and warm to hot, humid summers. It lies in USDA Plant [[hardiness zone]] 4a.<ref>{{cite web|title=USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map|url=http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|access-date=April 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227032333/http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/|archive-date=February 27, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The city features winters among the coldest in the contiguous United States; the coldest month of January has a normal mean temperature of {{convert|9.2|°F|1}}.

In 2011, Fargo won [[The Weather Channel]]'s "America's Toughest Weather City" poll. After almost 850,000 votes, blizzards, cold, and floods secured the title for the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=America's Toughest Weather City Champion|url=https://weather.com/outlook/weather-news/news/articles/americas-toughest-weather-city-champion_2011-03-31|website=Weather.com|access-date=July 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611212148/https://weather.com/outlook/weather-news/news/articles/americas-toughest-weather-city-champion_2011-03-31|archive-date=June 11, 2013}}</ref>
