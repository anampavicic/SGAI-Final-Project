'''Fasa''' ({{langx|fa|فسا}}){{efn|Also [[romanize]]d as '''Fasā''' and '''Fassa'''<ref>{{GEOnet3|-3062808}}</ref>}} is a city in the [[Central District (Fasa County)|Central District]] of [[Fasa County]], [[Fars province|Fars]] province, [[Iran]], serving as capital of both the county and the district.<ref name="Fars Province Structure">{{cite report|title=Approval of the organization and chain of citizenship of the elements and units of the national divisions of Fars province, centered in Shiraz|language=fa|website=lamtakam.com|via=Lam ta Kam|url=https://lamtakam.com/law/council_of_ministers/113032|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231207211349/https://lamtakam.com/law/council_of_ministers/113032|publisher=Ministry of the Interior, Council of Ministers|last=Habibi|first=Hassan|orig-date=Approved 21 June 1369|date=c. 2023|archive-date=7 December 2023|access-date=7 December 2023|id=Notification 82840/T128K}}</ref> The city's population in 2016 was 110,825.<ref name="2016 Fars Province"/> Fasa is the fourth most populous city of the province,<ref>{{IranCensus2016|07}}</ref> and dates back to the [[Achaemenid]] period.<ref name="from pasa"/>

Fasa's economy is based on agriculture and Pastoralism. [[Jahrom]], [[Darab]], [[Sarvestan]], [[Kherameh]] and [[Estahban]] are neighbours of Fasa. This city is located on the road from [[Shiraz]] to [[Kerman]], This has made Fasa a strategic and important city.

== Etymology ==
The name Fasa is derived from the older form '''Pasā'''.<ref name="Iranica">{{cite web |last1=Yusofnezad |first1=Minu |last2=Lerner |first2=Judith |title=FASĀ i. Geography and History |url=https://iranicaonline.org/articles/fasa-i |website=Encyclopaedia Iranica |access-date=8 March 2022}}</ref> Various etymologies for this name have been proposed.<ref name="Iranica"/><ref name="Iranica 2"/><ref name="Tavernier"/><ref name="from pasa"/><ref name="university"/> Local tradition holds that Fasa is named after a legendary prince named Pasa, son of Fars and grandson of [[Tahmuras]].<ref name="Iranica"/> In [[Ibn al-Balkhi]]'s retelling the legend, Fars granted the town of Fasa to Pasa; in [[Hamdallah Mustawfi]]'s version, Pasa founds the city himself (in this version, he is directly the son of Tahmuras).<ref name="Iranica"/>

[[Harold Bailey]] proposed on linguistic grounds that the name is ultimately derived from [[Old Persian]] ''*pa-sāya'', meaning "campground".<ref name="Iranica 2">{{cite web |last1=Hansman |first1=John F. |title=FASĀ ii. Tall-e Żaḥḥāk |url=https://iranicaonline.org/articles/fasa-ii |website=Encyclopaedia Iranica |access-date=8 March 2022}}</ref> This name would have referred to what was originally a Persian nomadic encampment that later evolved into a town (presumably Tall-e Zahhak, 3km south of present-day Fasa).<ref name="Iranica 2"/> It would have then come to refer more generally to the entire surrounding plain – i.e. the Fasa plain.<ref name="Iranica 2"/> The [[Persepolis Administrative Archives]] (tablets 49 and 53)<ref name="Tavernier"/> mention a place in Fars called (in [[Elamite language|Elamite]]) ''ba-a-ši-ya-an'', which George Glenn Cameron had already identified with Fasa; Bailey argued that this is an Elamite rendering of the Persian name ''*Pasāya''.<ref name="Iranica 2"/>

This identification is not entirely uncontested – for example, Jan Tavernier reconstructs this form as Old Persian ''*Paišiyā-'', literally meaning "before" and being a shortened form of a longer name.<ref name="Tavernier">{{Cite book |last=Tavernier |first=Jan |title=Iranica in the Achaemenid Period (ca. 550-330 B.C.) |location=Leuven |publisher=Peeters |year=2007 |isbn=9789042918337 |oclc=167407632 |pages=379, 389 |url=https://archive.org/details/IranicaInTheAchaemenidPeriodca.550-330B.c..LexiconOfOldIranian}}</ref> Tavernier instead prefers the form ''*Fasāta'', reconstructed from Elamite ''Pa-iš-šá-taš'', as the ancient name of Fasa.<ref name="Tavernier"/> Researchers have also considered the meaning of the word Fasa "the city of the [[Persians]]".<ref name="from pasa"/><ref name="university">{{cite web | url=http://www.fasau.ac.ir/%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B4%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87-%D9%81%D8%B3%D8%A7/%D8%A7%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AA/about-fasa | title=About Fasa | publisher=University of Fasa | access-date=9 April 2020 | archive-date=12 April 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200412073116/http://fasau.ac.ir/%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B4%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87-%D9%81%D8%B3%D8%A7/%D8%A7%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AA/about-fasa | url-status=dead }}</ref> Much earlier, the 13th century writer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] also suggested that the name meant "the north wind".<ref name="Iranica"/>

Whatever its original meaning was, the name of Fasa later became ''Pasā'' in [[Middle Persian]].<ref name="Iranica"/><ref name="Iranica 2"/> At some point the ancient site at Tall-e Zahhak was abandoned and the name was transferred to the modern site.<ref name="Iranica 2"/> Finally, after the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], since [[Arabic]] doesn't have the sound "P", Arabic authors wrote the name as ''Fasā'' or ''Basā''.<ref name="Iranica"/> Eventually, the Arabized form ''Fasā'' supplanted the old name ''Pasā'' locally as well.<ref name="Iranica"/>

The adjective (aka ''[[nisba (onomastics)|nesba]]'' or [[demonym]]) associated with Fasa today is '''''Fasā'ī'''''.<ref name="Iranica"/> An older form is ''Fasāwī'', which was used by some medieval writers such as [[Ibn al-Sam'ani]].<ref name="Iranica"/> Within Fars, a completely different demonym was used: according to Ibn al-Sam'ani and [[Hamza al-Isfahani|Hamza Esfahani]] (as quoted by Yaqut), the locals said ''Basāsīrī'' instead of ''Fasa'i''.<ref name="Iranica"/> This shares an origin with the Persian terms ''garm-sīr'' ("hot region") and ''sard-sīr'' ("cold region"), so that in effect ''basāsīrī'' meant "the Fasa region".<ref name="Iranica"/> Hamza Esfahani also mentioned a place near [[Na'in]] called [[Kasnā]], which used the similarly derived adjective ''kasnāsīrī''.<ref name="Iranica"/> A prominent bearer of this ''nesba'' was [[al-Basasiri|Abu'l-Harith Arslan Basasiri]], an 11th-century Turkic mercenary leader who led a rebellion against the caliph [[al-Qa'im (Abbasid caliph at Baghdad)|al-Qa'im]].<ref name="Iranica"/>

== History ==
The origins of Fasa go back to at least the [[Achaemenid]] period and probably earlier.<ref name="Iranica"/> Several prehistoric mounds, such as Tall-e Siah, indicate early human activity in the Fasa region; they mostly are from the [[Eneolithic]] period.<ref name="Iranica"/> One of these sites is Tall-e Zahhak, a 660x750&nbsp;m-wide [[tell (archaeology)|tell]] 3&nbsp;km southeast of present-day Fasa.<ref name="Iranica 2"/> Tall-e Zahhak represents the old site of Fasa itself, with many archaeological strata spanning a time between the 3rd millennium BCE and the 13th century CE.<ref name="Iranica 2"/> At some point, the old site at Tall-e Zahhak became abandoned, and the name "Fasa" migrated to the new location that is inhabited today.<ref name="Iranica 2"/> If the linguistic derivation of the name from Old Persian meaning "encampment" is correct, then Fasa probably began as a nomadic encampment that later developed into a permanent settlement.<ref name="Iranica 2"/>

There are two prehistoric archaeological sequences at Tall-e Zahhak: the older Khayrabad ware and the more recent Zahhak ware.<ref name="Iranica 2"/> Both are similar to different types of the [[Kaftari ware]] of central Fars and may date from the same period, which is tentatively estimated to be 2000-1800 BCE.<ref name="Iranica 2"/> There is then a gap until the Achaemenid period, when "finely-burnished red ware showing characteristic everted rims" appear in the archaeological record.<ref name="Iranica 2"/> There is a large mud-brick platform, which probably also dates from Achaemenid times given its resemblance to similar platforms at [[Persepolis]] and [[Pasargadae]].<ref name="Iranica 2"/> Another characteristically Achaemenid feature found at Tall-e Zahhak is a large fluted column base similar to the ones found at Persepolis.<ref name="Iranica 2"/> This column base may indicate that Achaemenid Fasa was the site of a royal palace or administrative center.<ref name="Iranica 2"/> In any case, Fasa was an important fortified settlement during this period.<ref name="Iranica"/> There is also evidence of occupation during [[Hellenistic]] times.<ref name="Iranica 2"/>

Fasa came under Muslim control peacefully in 644 (23 [[Hijri year|AH]]), when the Arab general [[Uthman ibn Abi al-As]] reached an agreement with the [[herbad]] of Fasa and [[Darabgerd]].<ref name="Iranica"/> According to [[Ibn al-Balkhi]], the herbad offered a payment of two million [[dirham]]s in return for ''[[amān]]'' (protection from harm), and promised that the locals would continue to pay the [[jizya]] tax to the Muslims.<ref name="Iranica"/> Another force was sent to Fars under [[Abdallah ibn Amir]] in 650 (29 AH).<ref name="Iranica"/>

In the 10th century, [[Estakhri]] described Fasa as the largest town in the ''kūra'' (province) of Darabgerd – it was almost as large as Shiraz, which was then the capital of Fars.<ref name="Iranica"/> Its buildings, he wrote, were "more spacious" than the ones in Shiraz, and they were made of [[cypress]] wood and mud.<ref name="Iranica"/> It had wide streets, a citadel, a moat, and a ''rabaz'' or market quarter outside the walls.<ref name="Iranica"/> Fasa was an affluent town, and its residents lived in relative comfort because their commercial activity brought in plenty of wealth.<ref name="Iranica"/> Fasa's agricultural districts produced both cold and warm weather fruits.<ref name="Iranica"/> The main religion was [[Sunni Islam]], of the same ''[[madhhab]]'' as [[Baghdad]].<ref name="Iranica"/> 

Estakhri listed some of the items sold at Fasa's markets: [[silk]]s, including so-called ''washy'' silks that were multicolored and sometimes [[brocade]]d; "good delicate costumes"; ''besāṭ''s (i.e. tablecloths and rugs); fine ''setr''s (i.e. curtains and bedsheets); ''fūṭa''s (i.e. napkins and towels); fine carpets; tablecloths; ''khargāh''s (i.e. fine tents); ''mandīl''s (i.e. [[handkerchief]]s and turban-like headgear); and [[safflower]].<ref name="Iranica"/> [[Moqaddasi]] wrote in 985 that Fasa was home to "the most righteous, pleasant, and liberal people of Fars" and noted that its marketplace was all built out of wood.<ref name="Iranica"/> He described its [[congregational mosque]] as being larger than the one in Shiraz; it was built from brick and featured two courtyards connected by a roofed passage like the one in Baghdad.<ref name="Iranica"/> The anonymous author of the ''[[Hudud al-'Alam]]'' in 982 also described Fasa as a large and prosperous town that was a center of commerce.<ref name="Iranica"/>

Fasa was devastated in 989/90 (379 AH) during a bloody [[Buyid]] civil war between Turkish mercenaries formerly employed by [[Sharaf al-Dawla]], who had recently died, and [[Daylamite]] troops loyal to [[Samsam al-Dawla]].<ref name="Iranica"/> Fasa had been a base of the Daylamites under Samsam al-Dawla, and the Turks, commanded by Sharaf al-Dawla's son Abu Ali, sacked Fasa and killed all the Daylamites stationed there before returning west.<ref name="Iranica"/>

Later, in 1050 (442 AH), the future [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] sultan [[Alp Arslan]] led a clandestine raid on Fasa, which was still under Buyid control.<ref name="Iranica"/> His forces snuck up on Fasa through the desert, killed many of the inhabitants, looted three million [[dinar]]s worth of valuables, and took 3,000 captives before returning to [[Merv]] in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]].<ref name="Iranica"/>

Fasa is rarely mentioned in later documents, probably because it had declined significantly by then.<ref name="Iranica"/> In the first decade of the 1100s, [[Ibn al-Balkhi]] wrote, "although Fasa is as large as Isfahan, it is in complete disarray, and the largest part thereof in ruin. [[Shabankara]] [tribesmen] had destroyed it; the ''atabeg'' [[Čāvlī]] had it rebuilt."<ref name="Iranica"/> The perception that Fasa had previously been a great city but had now fallen into decay is supported by the fact that the latest pottery fragments found at Tall-e Zahhak date from the 12th and 13th centuries.<ref name="Iranica 2"/>

In 1762/3 (1176 AH), [[Karim Khan Zand]] sent forces to subdue the [[Bakhtiari people|Bakhtiari]] tribe in the mountains near Isfahan.<ref name="Iranica"/> Two branches, the [[Haft Lang]] and [[Chahar Lang]], were forced to migrate; the Haft Lang were resettled near [[Qom]] and the Chahar Lang were resettled near Fasa.<ref name="Iranica"/> "As a gesture of goodwill", Karim Khan had agricultural lands provided for the Bakhtiaris.<ref name="Iranica"/> This event "might have had serious socio-economic and cultural consequences for Fasa".<ref name="Iranica"/> Later, [[Zayn al-Abedin Shirvani]] wrote that Fasa was "a pleasant townlet... Most of its inhabitants are [[Tajiks|Tajik]]... all of them are [[Shi'ite]] and not devoid of ''mardomī'' (civility)...Now it includes nearly two thousand houses, and its countryside nearly thirty hamlets and cultivated fields."<ref name="Iranica"/>

Urban Foundations of Fasa (Grand Mosque, Bazaar, Bath, etc.) was established during the [[Safavid]] period and expanded during the [[Afsharid]]s. Epidemics, famines, political games, insecurity and looting were among the most important factors in the destruction and decline of Fasa's prosperity during the [[Qajar]] period.<ref name="from pasa"/>

==Demographics==
===Language, ethnicity, and religion===
The people of Fasa speak [[Persian language]]. There is also a significant [[Khamseh Arabs|Khamseh Arab]] minority in Fasa. Almost all of the people are [[Shia]] [[Muslim]]s.<ref name="from pasa">{{cite book | title=From Pasa to Pasa | publisher=Fanoos Andisheh | author=Rezazadeh, Jalil | year=2009 | isbn=9786009085521}}</ref>
