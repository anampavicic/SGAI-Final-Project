The city is nicknamed the "[[Mekong Delta|Western]] Metropolis" ({{lang|vi|Tây Đô / 西都}}), and is located {{convert|169|km|0|abbr=off}} from [[Hồ Chí Minh City]].

== History ==
During the [[Vietnam War]], Cần Thơ was the home of the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]] IV Corps capital. The [[21st Division (South Vietnam)|ARVN 21st division]] was dedicated to protect the city of Cần Thơ, including the provinces of Chương Thiện (now in Hậu Giang), Bạc Liêu, An Xuyen (Cà Mau), Ba Xuyen (Soc Trang), and Kiên Giang. Before 1975, Cần Thơ was part of Phong Dinh province. On November 1, 1955, the third Light Division changed into the thirteenth Light Division, and the fifteenth, twelfth, and 106th regiments transformed into the 37th, 38th, and 39th regiments. The 37th and 38th Regiments consisted of battalions that originated in the present MR 3. The 39th regiment consisted of battalions from My Tho and Sa Dec in the Delta. The 39th Regiment participated in the successful campaigns against dissidents in Hua Hau in 1955–1956.

==Administrative system==
The city is an independent municipality at the same level as the other [[provinces of Vietnam]]. It was created in the beginning of 2004 by a split of the former Cần Thơ Province into two new administrative units: Cần Thơ City and [[Hậu Giang Province]].

Cần Thơ is subdivided into nine district-level sub-divisions:

{{div col}}
* 5 urban districts:
** [[Bình Thủy District|Bình Thủy]]
** [[Cái Răng District|Cái Răng]]
** [[Ninh Kiều District|Ninh Kiều]]
** [[Ô Môn District|Ô Môn]]
** [[Thốt Nốt District|Thốt Nốt]]
{{div col end}}
{{div col}}
* 4 rural districts:
** [[Cờ Đỏ District|Cờ Đỏ]]
** [[Phong Điền District, Cần Thơ|Phong Điền]]
** [[Thới Lai District|Thới Lai]]
** [[Vĩnh Thạnh District, Cần Thơ|Vĩnh Thạnh]]
{{div col end}}

They are further subdivided into five commune-level towns (or townlets), 36 communes, and 44 wards.

Ninh Kiều, which has the well-known Ninh Kiều port, is the central district and also the most populated and wealthiest of these districts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ca Ba Old House is Can Tho classic|url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/en/travel/21043/ca-ba-old-house-is-can-tho-classic.html|work=Vietnam.net Bridge|publisher=VIETNAMNET Bridge|access-date=15 October 2012|author=SGT|date=13 April 2012}}</ref>

The city borders the provinces of [[An Giang Province|An Giang]], [[Hậu Giang Province|Hậu Giang]], [[Kiên Giang Province|Kiên Giang]], [[Vĩnh Long Province|Vĩnh Long]] and [[Đồng Tháp Province|Đồng Tháp]].

==Transportation==
[[File:Cau-can-tho-tuonglamphotos.jpg|thumb|[[Cần Thơ Bridge]]]]

Before 1975, National Highway 4 (now [[National Route 1 (Vietnam)|National Route 1]]) bypassed the ferry from Binh Minh, VL to Cần Thơ where the ARVN 21st division patrolled heavily the ferry transportation to protect the civilians and ship merchants. South of the National Highway 4 from Cần Thơ to Ba Xuyen province (Soc Trang) were mainly heavily patrolled by ARVN soldiers to prevent route disruption.

Today, Cần Thơ is connected to the rest of the country by National Route 1A and [[Cần Thơ International Airport]]. The city's [[Cần Thơ Bridge|bridge]], which is now completed, is the longest [[cable-stayed bridge]] in Southeast Asia. The six-lane Saigon–Cần Thơ Expressway is being built in parts {{Clarify|date=June 2012}} from Hồ Chí Minh City to [[Mỹ Tho]]. [[Hydrofoil]] express boats link this city with [[Hồ Chí Minh City]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} From [[Phú Quốc]] island, tourists can use the ferry, passenger bus or taxi to transfer to Cần Thơ.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mekong-delta-tours.com/travel-guide/best-ways-to-get-to-can-tho-from-phu-quoc.html |title=best way to transfer from Phu Quoc to Cam Tho|access-date=3 October 2019}}</ref> There are many vehicles such as taxis, [[Grab (company)|Grab]] motorbikes, buses, vans and coaches.

==Tourism==
[[File:Namnha.jpg|thumb|Nam Nhã pagoda]]

The [[Mekong Delta]] is considered to be the "rice basket of Vietnam", contributing more than half of the nation's rice production. People say of Cần Thơ:
{{Cquote|{{lang|vi|Cần Thơ gạo trắng nước trong, <br /> Ai đi đến đó lòng không muốn về.}}<br />
Cần Thơ with its white rice and clear waters. <br /> For those who visit, who would ever want to leave.}}
Cần Thơ (shared with Hậu Giang) is famous for its floating markets, especially [[Floating markets of Vietnam|Cai Rang Floating Market]], where people sell and buy things on the river, as well as the bird gardens and the port of [[Ninh Kiều]]. The city offers a wide range of tropical fruits such as [[pomelo]], [[longan]], [[jackfruit]], [[mango]], [[guava]], banana, [[rambutan]], [[mangosteen]], [[dragon fruit]] and [[durian]]. The [[Cần Thơ City Museum]] has exhibits on the city's history.<ref>Emmons, p. 345.</ref>
