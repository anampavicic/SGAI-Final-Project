Its other neighboring states are [[Nevada]] to the northwest and [[California]] to the west. It also shares [[Mexico-United States border|an international border]] with the [[Mexican states]] of [[Sonora]] and [[Baja California]] to the south and southwest. It is the [[list of U.S. states and territories by area|6th-largest]] and the [[list of U.S. states and territories by population|14th-most-populous]] of the 50 states. Its [[Capital city|capital]] and [[List of largest cities|largest city]] is [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], which is the most populous state capital in the United States.

Arizona is the 48th state and last of the [[contiguous United States|contiguous states]] to be admitted to the Union, achieving statehood on February 14, 1912. Historically part of the territory of [[Alta California]] and [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México|Nuevo México]] in [[New Spain]], it became part of independent Mexico in 1821. After being defeated in the [[Mexican–American War]], Mexico ceded much of this territory to the United States in 1848, where the area became part of the [[territory of New Mexico]]. The southernmost portion of the state was acquired in 1853 through the [[Gadsden Purchase]].

[[Southern Arizona]] is known for its [[desert]] climate, with very hot summers and mild winters. [[Northern Arizona]] features forests of pine, [[Douglas fir]], and [[spruce]] trees; the [[Colorado Plateau]]; mountain ranges (such as the [[San Francisco Peaks|San Francisco Mountains]]); as well as large, deep [[canyon]]s, with much more moderate summer temperatures and significant winter snowfalls. There are [[skiing|ski resorts]] in the areas of [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]], [[Sunrise Park Resort|Sunrise]], and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]. In addition to the internationally known [[Grand Canyon National Park]], which is one of the [[Seven Natural Wonders of the World|world's seven natural wonders]], there are several [[U.S. National Forest|national forests]], [[National parks (United States)|national parks]], and [[National monument (United States)|national monuments]].

Arizona is home to a diverse population.

Since the 1980s, the proportion of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics]] has grown significantly owing to migration from Mexico and Central America. A substantial portion of the population are followers of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. Arizona's population and economy have grown dramatically since the 1950s because of inward migration, and the state is now a major hub of the [[Sun Belt]]. Cities such as Phoenix and Tucson have developed large, sprawling suburban areas. Many large companies, such as [[PetSmart]] and [[Circle K]],<ref>{{cite web |title=The 50 biggest companies in Arizona |url=https://azbigmedia.com/business/the-50-biggest-companies-in-arizona/ |website=AZBigMedia |access-date=24 January 2021 |archive-date=December 8, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201208190209/https://azbigmedia.com/business/the-50-biggest-companies-in-arizona/ |url-status=live}}</ref> have headquarters in the state, and Arizona is home to major universities, including the [[University of Arizona]], [[Arizona State University]], and [[Northern Arizona University]]. The state is known for a history of conservative politicians such as [[Barry Goldwater]] and [[John McCain]], though it has become a [[swing state]] since the 1990s.

==Etymology==
The state's name appears to originate from an earlier Spanish name, {{lang|es|Arizonac}}, derived from the [[Tohono O'odham|O'odham]] name {{lang|ood|alĭ ṣonak}}, meaning {{gloss|small spring}}. Initially this term was applied by Spanish colonists only to an area near the [[silver mining]] camp of [[Planchas de Plata, Sonora]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Bright |first=William |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5XfxzCm1qa4C&pg=PA47 |title=Native American Place Names of the United States |publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]] |year=2004 |isbn=9780806135984 |location=Norman, OK |page=47}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kitt |first1=E.O. |last2=Pearce |first2=T.M. |title=Arizona Place Name Records |journal=Western Folklore |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=284–287 |doi=10.2307/1496233 |year=1952 |jstor=1496233 | issn = 0043-373X}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Harper |first=Douglas |title=Arizona |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Arizona |url-status=live |work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |access-date=December 28, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728085024/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Arizona |archive-date=July 28, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=McClintock |first=James |year=1916 |title=Arizona, Prehistoric, Aboriginal, Pioneer, Modern: The Nation's Youngest Commonwealth within a Land of Ancient Culture |url=https://archive.org/details/arizonaprehisto00unkngoog |location=Chicago |publisher=The S.J.

==History==
{{main|History of Arizona}}
{{for timeline}}
For thousands of years before the modern era, Arizona was home to many ancient [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] civilizations. [[Hohokam]], [[Mogollon culture|Mogollon]], and [[Ancestral Puebloans|Ancestral Puebloan]] cultures were among those that flourished throughout the state. Many of their pueblos, cliffside dwellings, rock paintings and other prehistoric treasures have survived and attract thousands of tourists each year. {{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}

In 1539, [[Marcos de Niza]], a Spanish [[Franciscan]], became the first European to contact Native Americans. He explored parts of the present state and made contact with [[Native Americans in the United States|native]] inhabitants, probably the [[Sobaipuri]].

===20th century to present===
During the [[Mexican Revolution]] from 1910 to 1920, several battles were fought in the Mexican towns just across the border from Arizona settlements. Throughout the revolution, many Arizonans enlisted in one of the several armies fighting in Mexico. Only two significant engagements took place on U.S. soil between U.S. and Mexican forces: [[Pancho Villa]]'s 1916 [[Battle of Columbus (1916)|Columbus Raid]] in New Mexico and the [[Battle of Ambos Nogales]] in 1918 in Arizona.

After Mexican federal troops fired on U.S. soldiers, the American garrison launched an assault into [[Nogales, Sonora|Nogales, Mexico]]. The Mexicans eventually surrendered after both sides sustained heavy casualties. A few months earlier, just west of Nogales, an Indian War battle had occurred, considered the last engagement in the [[American Indian Wars]], which lasted from 1775 to 1918. U.S. soldiers stationed on the border confronted [[Yaqui Indians]] who were using Arizona as a base to raid the nearby Mexican settlements, as part of their wars against Mexico. {{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}

Arizona became a U.S. state on February 14, 1912, coinciding with [[Valentine's Day]].

Cotton farming and copper mining, two of Arizona's most important statewide industries, suffered heavily during the [[Great Depression]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Arizona economy during great depression|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Arizona-state/Economy/|last1=tan|first1=bri|website=Britannica|access-date=December 20, 2021|archive-date=August 31, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210831005620/https://www.britannica.com/place/Arizona-state/Economy|url-status=live}}</ref> But during the 1920s and even the 1930s, tourism began to develop as the important Arizonan industry it is today. Dude ranches, such as the K L Bar and Remuda in Wickenburg, along with the Flying V and Tanque Verde in Tucson, gave tourists the chance to take part in the flavor and activities of the "Old West". Several upscale hotels and resorts opened during this period, some of which are still top tourist draws.

The Phoenix-area [[Prisoner of war camp|POW camp site]] for Germans was purchased after the war by the [[Maytag]] family (of major [[home appliance]] fame). It was developed as the site of the [[Phoenix Zoo]]. A Japanese-American internment camp was on [[Mount Lemmon]], just outside the state's southeastern city of Tucson. Another [[POW camp]] was near the [[Gila River]] in eastern [[Yuma County, Arizona|Yuma County]]. Arizona was also home to the [[Steele Indian School Park|Phoenix Indian School]], one of several federal [[Indian boarding schools]] designed to assimilate Native American children into mainstream European-American culture. Children were often enrolled in these schools against the wishes of their parents and families. Attempts to suppress native identities included forcing the children to cut their hair, to take and use English names, to speak only English, and to practice Christianity rather than their native religions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/phoenix/ |title=Archaeology of the Phoenix Indian School |publisher=Archaeology.org |date=March 27, 1998 |access-date=July 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103142851/http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/phoenix/ |archive-date=November 3, 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Numerous Native Americans from Arizona fought for the United States during World War{{spaces}}II. Their experiences resulted in a rising activism in the postwar years to achieve better treatment and civil rights after their return to the state. After Maricopa County did not allow them to register to vote, in 1948 veteran Frank Harrison and Harry Austin, of the [[Mohave people|Mojave-Apache Tribe]] at [[Fort McDowell Indian Reservation]], brought a legal suit, ''[[Harrison and Austin v.

Arizona's population grew tremendously with residential and business development after World War{{spaces}}II, aided by the widespread use of [[air conditioning]], which made the intensely hot summers more comfortable. According to the ''Arizona Blue Book'' (published by the [[Arizona Secretary of State]]'s office each year), the state population in 1910 was 294,353. By 1970, it was 1,752,122. The percentage growth each decade averaged about 20% in the earlier decades, and about 60% each decade thereafter. {{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}

In the 1960s, [[retirement communities]] were developed.

Arizona is in the Southwestern United States as one of the [[Four Corners]] states. Arizona is the sixth [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|largest state by area]], ranked after [[New Mexico]] and before [[Nevada]]. Of the state's {{convert|113998|sqmi|km2|-3}}, approximately 15% is privately owned. The remaining area is public forest and parkland, [[Arizona State Trust Land|state trust land]] and Native American reservations. There are 24 [[National Park Service]] maintained sites in Arizona, including the three national parks of [[Grand Canyon National Park]], [[Saguaro National Park]], and the [[Petrified Forest National Park]].<ref>{{cite web |title=National Park Service – Arizona |url=https://www.nps.gov/state/az/index.htm |publisher=National Park Service |access-date=January 10, 2021 |archive-date=February 15, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210215074837/https://www.nps.gov/state/az/index.htm |url-status=live}}</ref>

Arizona is well known for its [[desert]] [[Basin and Range Province|Basin and Range]] region in the state's southern portions, which is rich in a [[landscape]] of [[xerophyte]] plants such as the [[cactus]]. This region's topography was shaped by prehistoric [[volcanism]], followed by the cooling-off and related [[subsidence]]. Its climate has exceptionally hot summers and mild winters. The state is less well known for its pine-covered north-central portion of the high country of the [[Colorado Plateau]] (see [[Arizona Mountains forests]]).

Like other states of the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] United States, Arizona is marked by high mountains, the Colorado plateau, and mesas.

The [[Mogollon Rim]] ({{IPA|/ ˌmoʊ gəˈyoʊn /}}), a {{convert|1998|ft|adj=on}} [[escarpment]], cuts across the state's central section and marks the southwestern edge of the Colorado Plateau. In 2002, this was an area of the [[Rodeo–Chediski Fire]], the worst fire in state history until 2011.

Located in northern Arizona, the [[Grand Canyon]] is a colorful, deep, steep-sided gorge, carved by the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]]. The canyon is one of the [[Seven Natural Wonders of the World]] and is largely contained in the [[Grand Canyon National Park]]{{snd}}one of the first national parks in the United States. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was a major proponent of designating the Grand Canyon area as a National Park, often visiting to hunt [[cougar|mountain lion]] and enjoy the scenery.

{{further|Climate change in Arizona}}
Due to its large area and variations in elevation, the state has a wide variety of localized climate conditions. In the lower elevations the climate is primarily desert, with mild winters and extremely hot summers. Typically, from late fall to early spring, the weather is mild, averaging a minimum of {{convert|60|°F}}.

Early in its history, Arizona's economy relied on the "five C's": copper (see ''[[Copper mining in Arizona]]''), cotton, cattle, [[citrus]], and [[climate]] (tourism). Copper is still extensively mined from many expansive open-pit and underground mines, accounting for two-thirds of the nation's output.

The Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas are served by public bus transit systems. Yuma and Flagstaff also have public bus systems. [[Greyhound Lines]] serves Phoenix, Tucson, Flagstaff, Yuma, and several smaller communities statewide.

A [[light rail]] system, called [[Valley Metro Rail]], was completed in December 2008; it connects Central Phoenix with the nearby cities of Mesa and Tempe.<ref>{{cite web|title=Valley metro rail opens|url=https://www.valleymetro.org/about/agency/fact-sheets-brochures/fact-sheets/rail-system-fact-sheet/|last1=Metro|first1=Valley|website=ValleyMetro|date=May 19, 2021|access-date=January 31, 2022|archive-date=February 7, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220207061330/https://www.valleymetro.org/about/agency/fact-sheets-brochures/fact-sheets/rail-system-fact-sheet|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Capitol complex===
[[File:Azcap.jpg|thumb|The original [[Arizona State Capitol]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]]]
The capital of Arizona is [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. The original [[Arizona State Capitol|Capitol building]], with its distinctive copper dome, was dedicated in 1901 (construction was completed for $136,000 in 1900) when the area was a territory. Phoenix became the official state capital with Arizona's admission to the union in 1912.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arizona government|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/1901-1938-historic-grounds-and-capitol-architecture-arizona-capitol-museum/YAKyrAcSohxbLA?hl=en/|website=artsandculture|access-date=December 2, 2021|archive-date=December 28, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211228075203/https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/1901-1938-historic-grounds-and-capitol-architecture-arizona-capitol-museum/YAKyrAcSohxbLA?hl=en%2F|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Arizona House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[Arizona Senate|Senate]] buildings were dedicated in 1960, and an Executive Office Building was dedicated in 1974 (the ninth floor of this building is where the Office of the Governor is located). The original Capitol building was converted into a museum.

The Capitol complex is fronted and highlighted by the richly landscaped [[Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza]], named after [[Wesley Bolin]], a governor who died in office in the 1970s. The site also includes many monuments and memorials, including the anchor and signal mast from the [[USS Arizona (BB-39)|USS ''Arizona'']] (one of the U.S. Navy ships [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|sunk in Pearl Harbor]]) and a granite version of the [[Ten Commandments]].

===State legislative branch===
The [[Arizona Legislature]] is [[bicameral]] and consists of a thirty-member Senate and a 60-member House of Representatives. Each of the thirty legislative districts has one senator and two representatives. Legislators are elected for two-year terms.<ref>{{Cite web |title=State Senators & Representatives {{!}} Citizens Clean Elections Commission |url=https://www.azcleanelections.gov/how-government-works/arizona-state-senators-and-representatives |access-date=2022-11-09 |website=www.azcleanelections.gov |archive-date=November 9, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221109035801/https://www.azcleanelections.gov/how-government-works/arizona-state-senators-and-representatives |url-status=live }}</ref>

Each Legislature covers a two-year period. The first session following the general election is known as the first regular session, and the session convening in the second year is known as the second regular session. Each regular session begins on the second Monday in January and adjourns ''sine die'' (terminates for the year) no later than Saturday of the week in which the 100th day from the beginning of the regular session falls. The President of the Senate and Speaker of the House, by rule, may extend the session up to seven additional days. Thereafter, the session can be extended only by a majority vote of members present of each house.

The majority party is the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], which has held power in both houses since 1993. The [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] picked up several legislative seats in recent elections, bringing both chambers one seat away from being equally divided as of 2021.<ref>{{cite web |title=Party Government Since 1857 {{!}} US House of Representatives: History, Art & Archives |url=https://history.house.gov/Institution/Presidents-Coinciding/Party-Government/ |website=history.house.gov |access-date=November 9, 2022 |archive-date=November 9, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221109022725/https://history.house.gov/Institution/Presidents-Coinciding/Party-Government/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Arizona state senators and representatives are elected for two-year terms and are limited to four consecutive terms in a chamber, though there is no limit on the total number of terms. When a lawmaker is term-limited from office, it is common for him or her to run for election in the other chamber.

Arizona's executive branch is headed by a [[Governor of Arizona|governor]], who is elected to a four-year term. The governor may serve any number of terms, though no more than two in a row. Arizona is one of the few states that has no governor's mansion. During their term, the governors reside within their private residence, with executive offices housed in the executive tower at the state capitol. The governor of Arizona is [[Katie Hobbs]] (D).

Governor [[Jan Brewer]] assumed office in 2009 after [[Janet Napolitano]] had her nomination by Barack Obama for [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] confirmed by the Senate.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ariz.

Other elected executive officials include the [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|Secretary of State]], [[State Treasurer]], [[Arizona Attorney General|State Attorney General]], [[state education agency|Superintendent of Public Instruction]], [[Arizona State Mine Inspector|State Mine Inspector]], and a five-member [[Arizona Corporation Commission|Corporation Commission]]. All elected officials hold a term of four years, and are limited to two consecutive terms (except the office of the State Mine Inspector, which is limited to four terms).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/const/19/0.1.htm |title=Format Document |publisher=Azleg.gov |date=January 1, 1993 |access-date=September 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917193722/http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=%2Fconst%2F19%2F0.1.htm |archive-date=September 17, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Arizona is one of five states that do not have a [[Lieutenant governor (United States)#Arizona|lieutenant governor]]. The elected secretary of state is first in line to succeed the governor in the event of death, disability, resignation, or removal from office. If appointed, the Secretary of State is not eligible and the next governor is selected from the next eligible official in the line of succession, including the attorney general, state treasurer, and superintendent of public instruction. Since 1977, four secretaries of state and one attorney general have succeeded to the state's governorship.

On November 8, 2022, Arizona voters approved a state constitutional amendment (Proposition 131) that created the position and office of the lieutenant governor beginning with the 2026 elections. The position will be elected on a joint ticket with the governor. The lieutenant governor ascends to the governorship if the incumbent governor dies, resigns, or is removed (via impeachment conviction) from office. The proposition, through a law pre-passed by the state legislature, also tasks the governor with assigning a job to her or his running mate, such as chief of staff, the director of the state Department of Administration, or "any position" to which the governor can appoint someone by law.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Stern |first=Ray |date=8 November 2022 |title=Arizona voters approve Proposition 131 to create lieutenant governor position |url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/11/08/arizona-proposition-131-results-lieutenant-governor-position/10634466002/ |access-date=12 November 2023 |website=The Arizona Republic}}</ref>

===State judicial branch===
The [[Arizona Supreme Court]] is the highest court in Arizona, consisting of a chief justice, a vice chief justice, and five associate justices. Justices are appointed by the governor from a list recommended by a bipartisan commission and must be sustained in office by election after the first two years following their appointment. Subsequent sustaining elections occur every six years. The supreme court has appellate jurisdiction in death penalty cases, but nearly all other appellate cases go through the [[Arizona Court of Appeals]] first. The court has original jurisdiction in a few other circumstances, as outlined in the state constitution. The court meets in the Arizona Supreme Court Building at the capitol complex (at the southern end of Wesley Bolin Plaza).

The Arizona Court of Appeals, subdivided into two divisions, is the intermediate court in the state. Division One is based in Phoenix, consists of nineteen judges, and has jurisdiction in the Western and Northern regions of the state, along with the greater Phoenix area. Division Two is based in Tucson, consists of nine judges, and has jurisdiction over the Southern regions of the state, including the Tucson area. Judges are selected in a method similar to the one used for state supreme court justices.

Each county of Arizona has a [[Arizona Superior Court|superior court]], the size and organization of which are varied and generally depend on the size of the particular county.

From statehood through the late 1940s, Arizona was primarily dominated by the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]. During this time, the Democratic candidate for the presidency carried the state each election, the only exceptions being the elections of [[1920 United States presidential election|1920]], [[1924 United States presidential election|1924]] and [[1928 United States presidential election|1928]]{{snd}}all three were national [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] landslides.

In 1924, Congress had passed a law granting citizenship and suffrage to all Native Americans, some of whom had previously been excluded as members of tribes on reservations. Legal interpretations of Arizona's constitution prohibited Native Americans living on reservations from voting, classifying them as being under "guardianship".<ref name="HAvote"/> This interpretation was overturned as being incorrect and unconstitutional in 1948 by the Arizona Supreme Court, following a lawsuit by World War{{spaces}}II Indian veterans [[Frank Harrison (soldier)|Frank Harrison]] and Harry Austin, both of the [[Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation]]. The landmark case is ''[[Harrison and Austin v. Laveen]]''. After the men were refused the opportunity to register in Maricopa County, they filed lawsuit against the registrar. The [[National Congress of American Indians]], the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], the [[Department of the Interior]], and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] all filed ''amicus curiae'' (friends of the court) briefs in the case. The State Supreme Court established the rights of Native Americans to vote in the state; at the time, they comprised about 11% of the population.<ref name="HAvote"/> That year, a similar provision was overturned in New Mexico when challenged by another Indian veteran in court. These were the only two states that had continued to prohibit Native Americans from voting.<ref name="NAvote">[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2012/10/29/history-indian-voting-rights-and-why-its-important-vote-140373 Dr. Dean Chavers, "History of Indian voting rights and why it's important"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160707201026/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2012/10/29/history-indian-voting-rights-and-why-its-important-vote-140373 |date=July 7, 2016 }}, ''Indian Country Today'', October 29, 2012; accessed July 17, 2016.

Arizona voted Republican in every presidential election from 1952 to 1992, with [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] winning the state by particularly large margins. During this forty-year span, it was the only state not to be carried by a Democrat at least once.

Democrat [[Lyndon Johnson]], in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]], lost the state by fewer than 5,000 votes to Arizona Senator and native [[Barry Goldwater]]. (This was the most closely contested state in what was otherwise a landslide victory for Johnson that year.) Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] ended this streak in [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], when he won Arizona by a little over two percentage points (Clinton had previously come within less than two percent of winning Arizona's electoral votes in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]]). From 2000 until 2016, the majority of the state continued to support Republican presidential candidates by solid margins. In the [[2020 United States presidential election]], [[Joe Biden]] again broke the streak by becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Arizona since 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Merica|first=Dan|title=Biden carries Arizona, flipping a longtime Republican stronghold|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/12/politics/biden-wins-arizona/index.html|access-date=2020-11-13|website=CNN|date=November 13, 2020|archive-date=November 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201113043642/https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/12/politics/biden-wins-arizona/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Since the mid 20th century, the Republican Party has also dominated Arizona politics in general. The fast-growing Phoenix and Tucson suburbs became reliably Republican areas from the 1950s onward. During this time, many "Pinto Democrats", or conservative Democrats from rural areas, became increasingly willing to support Republicans at the state and national level. While the state normally supports Republicans at the federal level, Democrats are often competitive in statewide elections. Two of the last six governors have been Democrats.

On March 4, 2008, Senator [[John McCain]] effectively clinched the Republican nomination for 2008, becoming the first major party presidential nominee from the state since Barry Goldwater in 1964.

Arizona politics is dominated by a longstanding rivalry between its two largest counties, [[Maricopa County|Maricopa]] and [[Pima County|Pima]]{{snd}}home to Phoenix and Tucson, respectively. The two counties have almost 75 percent of the state's population and cast almost 80 percent of the state's vote. They also elect a substantial majority of the state legislature.

Maricopa County is home to almost 60 percent of the state's population, and most of the state's elected officials live there. Before [[Joe Biden]] won Maricopa County in 2020, it had voted Republican in every presidential election since 1952. This includes the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]] run of native son Barry Goldwater; he would not have carried his home state without his 20,000-vote margin in Maricopa County. Similarly, McCain won Arizona by eight percentage points in 2008, aided by his 130,000-vote margin in Maricopa County.

In contrast, Pima County, home to Tucson, and most of southern Arizona have historically voted more Democratic. While Tucson's suburbs lean Republican, they hold to a somewhat more moderate brand of Republicanism than is common in the Phoenix area.

A November 2011 [[Public Policy Polling]] survey found 44% of Arizona voters supported the legalization of same-sex marriage, while 45% opposed it and 12% were not sure. A separate question on the same survey found 72% of respondents supported legal recognition of same-sex couples, with 40% supporting same-sex marriage, 32% supporting civil unions, 27% opposing all legal recognition and 1% not sure. Arizona Proposition 102, known by its supporters as the Marriage Protection Amendment, appeared as a legislatively referred constitutional amendment on the November 4, 2008 ballot in Arizona, where it was approved: 56–43%. It amended the Arizona Constitution to define marriage as between one man and one woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2011/PPP_Release_AZ_1130424.pdf|title=AZ pro-civil unions, remembers Goldwater fondly|access-date=April 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513164507/http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2011/PPP_Release_AZ_1130424.pdf|archive-date=May 13, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

On October 17, 2014, Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne announced his office would no longer object to same-sex marriage, in response to a U.S. District Court Ruling on Arizona Proposition 102.

==Education==
===Elementary and secondary education===
Public schools in Arizona are separated into about 220 local school districts which operate independently, but are governed in most cases by elected county school superintendents; these are in turn overseen by the Arizona State Board of Education and the [[Arizona Department of Education]]. A state [[Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction|Superintendent of Public Instruction]] (elected in partisan elections every even-numbered year when there is not a presidential election, for a four-year term). In 2005, a School District Redistricting Commission was established with the goal of combining and consolidating many of these districts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Number of schools in arizona|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/laurieroberts/2015/01/15/ducey-school-budgets-classroom-spending-unification/21778873/|last=Roberts|first=Laurie|website=azcentreal|access-date=December 2, 2021}}</ref>

Arizona is served by three public universities: The [[University of Arizona]], [[Arizona State University]], and [[Northern Arizona University]]. These schools are governed by the [[Arizona Board of Regents]].

Private higher education in Arizona is dominated by a large number of for-profit and "chain" (multi-site) universities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?s=AZ&ct=2+3&ic=1|title=College Navigator{{snd}}Search Results|website=nces.ed.gov|access-date=February 3, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511163744/http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?s=AZ&ct=2+3&ic=1|archive-date=May 11, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

Arizona has a wide network of two-year vocational schools and [[community colleges]]. These colleges were governed historically by a separate statewide board of directors but, in 2002, the state legislature transferred almost all oversight authority to individual community college districts.<ref>2002 Legislature{{snd}}HB 2710, which later became ARS 15-1444</ref> The Maricopa County Community College District includes 11 community colleges throughout Maricopa County and is one of the largest in the nation.

{{main|Music of Arizona}}

Arizona is prominently featured in the lyrics of many [[Country and Western]] songs, such as [[Jamie O'Neal]]'s hit ballad "[[There Is No Arizona]]". [[George Strait]]'s "Oceanfront Property" uses "ocean front property in Arizona" as a metaphor for a sucker proposition. The line "see you down in Arizona Bay" is used in a [[Tool (band)|Tool]] song in reference to the possibility (expressed as a ''hope'' by comedian [[Bill Hicks]]) that Southern California will one day fall into the ocean. [[Glen Campbell]], a notable resident, popularized the song "[[By The Time I Get To Phoenix]]".
[[File:TakeItEasy WinslowAZ.jpg|thumb|[[Standin' on the Corner Park]] and mural in [[Winslow, Arizona]]]]

Arizona is a popular location for [[Major League Baseball]] [[spring training]], as it is the site of the [[Cactus League]]. Spring training was first started in Arizona in 1947, when Brewers owner Veeck sold them in 1945 but went on to purchase the Cleveland Indians in 1946. He decided to train the Cleveland Indians in [[Tucson]] and convinced the New York Giants to give [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] a try. Thus, the Cactus League was born.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://azcentral.com/community/mesa/articles/2009/07/13/20090713mr-buckhorn0715ASF.html|title=Buckhorn Baths: A unique Mesa landmark|website=www.azcentral.com|access-date=December 7, 2019|archive-date=February 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210220145600/https://azcentral.com/community/mesa/articles/2009/07/13/20090713mr-buckhorn0715ASF.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

On March 9, 1995, Arizona was awarded a franchise to begin to play for the 1998 season. A $130{{spaces}}million franchise fee was paid to Major League Baseball and on January 16, 1997, the Diamondbacks were officially voted into the National League.

Since their debut, the Diamondbacks have won five National League West titles, two National League Championship pennants, and the [[2001 World Series]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Jeff Munn |url=https://staatalent.com/client/jeff-munn/ |access-date=2022-09-22 |website=Sportscasters Talent Agency of America |language=en-US |archive-date=September 22, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220922043203/https://staatalent.com/client/jeff-munn/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Arizona Diamondbacks are National League Champions, advance to the World Series for the second time in franchise history |url=https://www.mlb.com/press-release/press-release-arizona-diamondbacks-are-national-league-champions-advance-to-the- |access-date=2024-06-14 |website=MLB.com |language=en}}</ref>
