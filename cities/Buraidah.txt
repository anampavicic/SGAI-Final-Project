[[File:Buraida desertification 09.jpg|thumb|drop irrigation of young plants at areas of the national Center]]
The goals of the center are to increase green spaces, combat desertification, rehabilitate degraded vegetation sites, raise awareness among the population to reduce negatively impacting agricultural practices and improve quality of life. The campaign is in line with the mission of the National Center for Vegetation Development and Combating Desertification.<ref>[https://www.eyeofriyadh.com/directory/details/11981_the-national-center-for-vegetation-development-and-combating-desertification Goal of the national center]</ref> 
The National Center, in collaboration with the National Water Company, has now completed the planting of one million trees in the Buraida oasis region. This oasis covers an area of more than 28 square kilometers in al-Qasim province and contributes to the Saudi Green Initiative (SGI) with its goals of planting 10 billion trees through the national tree planting program.
The private sector is crucial in all tree planting projects across the Kingdom. These projects, monitored by the Center, aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In addition, they also focus on protecting local species' ecosystems from extinction and promoting sustainable practices. <ref>[https://www.leaders-mena.com/vegetation-cover-plants-million-trees-in-buraidah-oasis/ role of the private sector]</ref>

To achieve this, the Vegetation Cover Center launched the National Tree Planting Program. This program operates in 13 regional branches in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture. It includes a wide range of participants – government, private sector, non-profit organizations and volunteers. The common goal is to fulfill the objectives of the Saudi Green Initiative.<ref>Saudi Green Initiative [https://www.greeninitiatives.gov.sa/knowledge-hub/third-edition-of-saudi-green-initiative-forum-to-take-place-during-cop28/] </ref>

The center focuses on the development and protection of vegetation sites, monitoring and rehabilitation of degraded areas, including the management and use of rangelands, forests and national parks. It is also about minimizing interference with vegetation cover, combating deforestation across the Kingdom and protecting natural resources and biodiversity.<ref>[https://www.arabnews.com/node/2433596/amp Program of the center for 2024]</ref>
