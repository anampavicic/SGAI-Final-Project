Before the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|arrival of the Spanish]], the area was inhabited by the [[Nisenan]], [[Maidu]], and other [[indigenous peoples of California]]. In 1808, Spanish cavalryman [[Gabriel Moraga]] surveyed and named the ''Río del Santísimo Sacramento'' (Sacramento River), after the [[Blessed Sacrament]]. In 1839, [[Juan Bautista Alvarado]], [[List of Governors of California before 1850|Mexican governor]] of [[Alta California]], granted the responsibility of colonizing the Sacramento Valley to [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-born Mexican citizen [[John Sutter|John Augustus Sutter]], who subsequently established [[Sutter's Fort]] and the settlement at the ''Rancho [[New Helvetia|Nueva Helvetia]].'' Following the American [[Conquest of California]] and the 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo]], the waterfront developed by Sutter began to be developed and incorporated in 1850 as the City of Sacramento. In 1852, the city offered its county courthouse to the state of California to house the state legislature, resulting in the city becoming the permanent state capital in 1854 and ushering in the construction of a new state capitol building which was finished in 1874.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ktla.com/news/when-and-how-did-sacramento-become-californias-capital-city/ |title=When and how did Sacramento become California's capital? |last=Martinez |first=Jeremiah |date=September 18, 2022 |website=KTLA 5 |access-date=June 27, 2023 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

== History ==
{{Main|History of Sacramento, California}}
{{For timeline}}

=== Pre-Columbian period ===
<!--If we could talk about this heading instead or re-editing that would be great. Please see talk page. -->
[[Nisenan]] (Southern [[Maidu]]), [[Modoc people|Modoc]], and [[Plains Miwok]] American Indians have lived in the area for perhaps thousands of years. Until the settlers arrived who would eventually make Sacramento their home, these tribes left little evidence of their existence. Their diet was dominated by [[acorn]]s taken from the plentiful oak trees in the region and by fruits, bulbs, seeds, and roots gathered throughout the year.

=== Spanish period ===
In 1808, the Spanish explorer [[Gabriel Moraga]] encountered and named the [[Sacramento Valley]] and the Sacramento River. A Spanish writer with the Moraga expedition wrote:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cathedralsacramento.org/ |title=Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament – Sacramento, California |publisher=Cathedralsacramento.org |date=November 11, 2012 |access-date=November 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116093832/http://www.cathedralsacramento.org/ |archive-date=November 16, 2012}}</ref>
<blockquote>
Canopies of oaks and cottonwoods, many festooned with grapevines, overhung both sides of the blue current. Birds chattered in the trees and big fish darted through the pellucid depths. The air was like [[champagne]], and (''the Spaniards)'' drank deep of it, drank in the beauty around them. "¡Es como el sagrado sacramento! (It's like the Blessed Sacrament.)"
</blockquote>
The valley and the river were then christened after the "Most Holy Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ," referring to the Catholic [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacrament]] of the [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Eucharist]].

=== Mexican period ===
[[File:Sutterfort (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|In 1839, [[John Augustus Sutter]] established [[Sutter's Fort]], which he called [[New Helvetia|Nueva Helvetia]]. In 1841, he was officially granted the land by Governor [[Juan Bautista Alvarado]].]]

[[John Sutter|John Sutter Sr.]] first arrived in the area on August 13, 1839, at the confluence of the American and Sacramento Rivers with a Mexican land grant of {{convert|50,000|acre|ha}}. The next year, he and his party established Sutter's Fort, a massive adobe structure with walls {{convert|18|ft|m}} high and {{convert|3|ft|m|spell=in}} thick.<ref name="legendsofamerica.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/ca-oldsacramento.html|title=Old Sacramento, California – Walking on History|publisher=Legends of America|access-date=October 2, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525050816/http://www.legendsofamerica.com/ca-oldsacramento.html|archive-date=May 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Representing Mexico, Sutter Sr. called his colony New [[Helvetia]], a Swiss-inspired name, and was the political authority and dispenser of justice in the new settlement. Soon, the colony began to grow as more and more pioneers headed west. Within just a few short years, Sutter Sr. had become a grand success, owning a {{convert|10|acre|ha|adj=on}} orchard and a herd of 13,000 cattle. Fort Sutter became a regular stop for the increasing number of immigrants coming through the valley. In 1847, Sutter Sr. received 2,000 fruit trees, which started the agriculture industry in the Sacramento Valley. Later that year, Sutter Sr. hired James Marshall to build a [[sawmill]] so he could continue to expand his empire,<ref name="legendsofamerica.com" /> but unbeknownst to many, Sutter Sr.'s "empire" had been built on thin margins of credit.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/johnsutterlifeon00hurt/page/83 <!-- quote=his father's loose business habits. --> John Sutter: A Life on the North American Frontier] By Albert L. Hurtado. University of Oklahoma Press, 2006. p. 236. Retrieved September 10, 2017.</ref>

=== American period ===
[[File:Sacramento california 1849.jpg|thumb|left|Sacramento in 1849, when the city was an economic center of the [[California Gold Rush]]]]
In 1848, when [[James W. Marshall]] discovered gold at [[Sutters Mill|Sutter's Mill]] in [[Coloma, California|Coloma]] (some {{convert|50|mi|km|1|abbr=on|disp=or}} northeast of the fort), numerous gold-seekers came to the area, increasing the population. In August 1848, Sutter Sr.'s son, [[John Augustus Sutter Jr.|John Sutter Jr.]], arrived to assist his father in reducing his [[debt]]. The Sutters struggled to contain the effects of thousands of new gold miners and prospectors in the area, many of whom squatted on unwatched portions of the vast Sutter lands or stole various unattended Sutter properties or belongings. For Sutter, his employee's discovery of gold in the area turned out to be a bane.

By December 1848, John Sutter Jr., in association with [[Samuel Brannan]], began laying out the City of Sacramento, {{convert|2|mi|km}} south of his father's settlement of New Helvetia. This venture was undertaken against the wishes of Sutter Sr., but the father, being deeply in debt, was unable to stop it. For commercial reasons, the new city was named "Sacramento City" after the [[Sacramento River]]. Sutter Jr. and Brannan had [[United States Army]] Captain [[William H. Warner]] assigned to draft the official layout of the city, which included 26 lettered and 31 numbered streets (today's grid from C St. to Broadway and from Front St. to Alhambra Blvd.) Relations between Sutter and his son became embittered after Sacramento became an overnight commercial success. (Sutter's Fort, Mill, and the town of [[Sutterville, California|Sutterville]], all founded by John Sutter Sr., eventually failed).
[[File:Sacramento, CA USA - panoramio (10).jpg|thumb|[[Old Sacramento State Historic Park|Old Sacramento]], the oldest quarter of the city, grew up along the [[Sacramento River]] in the mid-1800s.]]
Residents of Sacramento adopted a [[Municipal charter|city charter]] in 1849, which was recognized by the state legislature in 1850. Sacramento is the oldest [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] city in California, incorporated on February 27, 1850.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofsacramento.org/about_the_city.htm |title=About the City of Sacramento |publisher=City of Sacramento |access-date=November 16, 2012 |archive-date=November 23, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123091648/http://www.cityofsacramento.org/about_the_city.htm}}</ref>

On January 10, 1850, a flood occurred that devastated the city. The rushing waters uprooted homes and drowned livestock. The city was almost destroyed. Due to the efforts of [[Hardin Bigelow]], Sacramento's first elected mayor, the construction of the city's first levee was completed in early 1852 (the city became known as "The Levee City"). However, a month after it was completed, it was breached during the first major storm of the season and the city flooded again.

The [[Great Flood of 1862]] from December 1861 to January 1862 caused the worst flooding in Sacramento's history. In 1861, Governor [[Leland Stanford]], who was inaugurated in early January 1862, traveled to his inauguration in a rowboat.

The [[California State Legislature]], with the support of Governor [[John Bigler]], moved to Sacramento in 1854. The capital of California under Spanish (and, subsequently, Mexican) rule had been [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], where, in 1849, the first [[Constitutional Convention (California)|Constitutional Convention]] and state elections were held. The convention decided [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] would be the new state's capital. From California's statehood beginning September 9, 1850 through 1851, the legislature met in San Jose. It moved to [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] in 1852 and [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] in 1853, before ending up in Sacramento in 1854. During the 1850s the city was [[Consolidated city-county|consolidated with]] the County of Sacramento.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=P_sBAAAAYAAJ&num=9 ''The California State register and year book of facts: for the year 1859''], Henry G. Langley and Samuel A. Morison, San Francisco, 1859, p.315</ref> In the [[California Constitutional Conventions|Sacramento Constitutional Convention of 1879]], Sacramento was named the permanent state capital.

The [[Classical Revival]]-style [[California State Capitol]], similar to the national Capitol, was started in 1860 and completed in 1874. In 1861, the legislative session was moved to the [[Merchants Exchange Building (San Francisco)|Merchants Exchange Building in San Francisco]] for one session because of the massive flooding in Sacramento. From 1862 to 1868, part of the [[Leland Stanford Mansion]] was used for the governor's offices during Stanford's tenure as the Governor; and the legislature met in the Sacramento County Courthouse. The legislative chambers were first occupied in 1869, while construction continued around them.

With its new status and strategic location, Sacramento quickly prospered. It was designated as the western terminus of the [[Pony Express]]. Later it became a terminus of the [[First transcontinental railroad]], which began construction in Sacramento in 1863 and was financed by "[[The Big Four (Central Pacific Railroad)|The Big Four]]"—[[Mark Hopkins Jr.|Mark Hopkins]], [[Charles Crocker]], [[Collis P. Huntington]], and [[Leland Stanford]]. Both the American and especially Sacramento rivers were key elements in the economic success of the city. Sacramento effectively controlled commerce on these rivers, and public works projects were funded through taxes levied on goods unloaded from boats and loaded onto rail cars in the historic [[Sacramento Railyards|Sacramento Rail Yards]].

From 1862 until the mid-1870s, Sacramento raised the level of its downtown by building reinforced brick walls on its downtown streets and filling the resulting street walls with dirt. The previous first floors of buildings became [[basement]]s, with open space between the street and the building, previously the [[sidewalk]], now at the basement level. Over the years, many of these underground spaces have been filled or destroyed by subsequent development. However, it is still possible to view portions of the "[[Old Sacramento State Historic Park#Old Sacramento Underground|Sacramento Underground]]".

The city's current charter was adopted by voters in 1920.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sacbee.com/<!-- Incomplete URL --> |newspaper=[[Sacramento Bee]] |date=September 26, 2009 |title=Status quo for city governance? |access-date=November 21, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120223741/http://www.sacbee.com/ |archive-date=November 20, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> As a [[charter city]], Sacramento is exempt from many laws and regulations passed by the [[California State Legislature|state legislature]]. The city has expanded continuously over the years. The 1964 merger of the City of [[North Sacramento]] with Sacramento substantially increased its population, and large annexations of the [[Natomas, Sacramento, California|Natomas]] area eventually led to significant population growth throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.

Sacramento County (along with a portion of adjacent [[Placer County, California|Placer County]]) is served by a customer-owned electric utility, the [[Sacramento Municipal Utility District]] (SMUD). Sacramento voters approved the creation of SMUD in 1923.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Sacramento Bee]]|date=September 26, 2012|title=Endorsements: Michael Picker is best pick for SMUD Ward 5|author=Editorial Board|access-date=November 21, 2012 |url=http://www.sacbee.com/2012/09/26/4855122/endorsements-michael-picker-is.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109061646/http://www.sacbee.com/2012/09/26/4855122/endorsements-michael-picker-is.html |archive-date=November 9, 2012}}</ref> In April 1946, after 12&nbsp;years of litigation, a judge ordered [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company|Pacific Gas & Electric]] to transfer the title of Sacramento's electric distribution system to SMUD. Today SMUD is the sixth-largest public electric utility in the U.S. and is a leader in innovative programs and services, including the development of clean fuel resources, such as [[solar energy|solar power]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hydrorelicensing.smud.org/public/pub_com.htm |title=UARP Relicensing Public Participation Community Oriented Utility |publisher=SMUD |access-date=November 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208105239/http://hydrorelicensing.smud.org/public/pub_com.htm |archive-date=February 8, 2013}}</ref>

The year following the creation of SMUD, 1924, brought several events in Sacramento: [[Standard Oil]] executive Verne McGeorge established [[McGeorge School of Law]], American [[department store]] [[Weinstock & Lubin]] opened a new store at 12th and K street, the US$2&nbsp;million [[Senator Hotel]] was opened, Sacramento's drinking water became filtered and treated drinking water, and Sacramento boxer Georgie Lee fought [[Francisco Guilledo]], a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] professional [[Boxing|boxer]] known as Pancho Villa, at L Street Auditorium on March 21.<ref name="Prohibition">{{cite news|page=27 |newspaper=[[Sacramento Bee]] |date=July 30, 1989|title=1920s A Wet Prohibition, A City of North Sac, The First Woman Mayor |first=Don |last=Stanle}}</ref>

Early in World War II, the Sacramento Assembly Center (also known as the Walerga Assembly Center) was established to house Japanese Americans [[Internment of Japanese Americans|forcibly "evacuated" from the West Coast]] under [[Executive Order 9066]]. The camp was one of fifteen temporary detention facilities where over 110,000 [[Japanese Americans]], two-thirds of them U.S. citizens, were held while construction on the more permanent [[War Relocation Authority]] camps was completed. The assembly center was built on the site of a former migrant labor camp, and inmates began arriving from Sacramento and San Joaquin Counties on May 6, 1942. It closed after only 52 days, on June 26, and the population of 4,739 was transferred to the [[Tule Lake Unit, World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument|Tule Lake]] concentration camp. The site was then turned over to the Army Signal Corps and dedicated as [[Camp Kohler]].

After the war and the end of the incarceration program, returning Japanese Americans were often unable to find housing and so 234 families temporarily lived at the former assembly center. Camp Kohler was destroyed by a fire in December 1947, and the assembly center site is now part of the Foothill Farms-North Highlands subdivision.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Sacramento%20%28detention%20facility%29/ |title=Sacramento (detention facility) |publisher=Densho Encyclopedia |access-date=August 8, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810173504/http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Sacramento%20%28detention%20facility%29/ |archive-date=August 10, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1967, [[Ronald Reagan]] became the last [[Governor of California]] to live permanently in the city. The 1980s and 1990s saw the closure of several local military bases: [[McClellan Air Force Base]], [[Mather Air Force Base]], and Sacramento Army Depot. In 1980, there was another flood. Despite military base closures and the decline of agricultural food processing, Sacramento has continued to experience population growth in recent years. Primary sources of population growth are an influx of residents from the nearby [[San Francisco Bay Area]], as well as immigration from Asia and Latin America.

In 1985, Hugh Scrutton, a 38-year-old Sacramento, California, computer store owner, was killed by a nail-and-splinter-loaded bomb placed in the parking lot of his store. In 1996, his death was attributed to the Unabomber, [[Theodore Kaczynski]].

After acquiring the majority stake in the [[Sacramento Kings]], the team's new owner, [[Vivek Ranadivé]], with the help of the city, agreed to build a new arena in the downtown area. With a final estimated cost of $558.2&nbsp;million, Sacramento's [[Golden 1 Center]] opened on September 30, 2016.

== Geography ==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city covers {{convert|100.1|sqmi|km2}}. 97.81% of it is land, and 2.19% of it is water.

Depth to groundwater is typically about {{convert|30|ft|m|0}}. Much of the land to the west of the city (in [[Yolo County, California|Yolo County]]) is permanently reserved for a vast flood control basin (the [[Yolo Bypass]]), due to the city's historical vulnerability to floods. As a result, the contiguous urban area sprawls only {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=in}} west of downtown (as [[West Sacramento, California]]) but {{convert|30|mi|km}} northeast and east, into the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] foothills, and {{convert|10|mi|km}} to the south into valley farmland.

The city is at the confluence of the [[Sacramento River]] and the [[American River]] and has a deep-water port connected to the [[San Francisco Bay]] by a channel through the [[Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta]]. It is the shipping and rail center for the [[Sacramento Valley]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Sacramento Vacation Information {{!}} Hotels, Restaurants, Events, and Things to Do|url = http://www.visitsacramento.com/|publisher = Visit Sacramento|access-date = November 16, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151109180143/http://www.visitsacramento.com/|archive-date = November 9, 2015|url-status = live}}</ref>

===Trees===

A prominent [[water tower]] bore the slogan "City of Trees" until 2017 when it was repainted with the words "America's Farm-to-Fork Capital" (referring to the [[farm-to-fork]] movement, which promotes the consumption of locally-grown food).

==== Notable areas ====
=====Capitol Mall===== 
Capitol Mall connects West Sacramento and Downtown Sacramento. Some notable landmarks on this road include the Tower Bridge, Old Sacramento, and the California State Capitol Building. Capitol Mall is considered to be the business district of the city. Skyscrapers such as the [[Wells Fargo Center (Sacramento)|Wells Fargo Center]] and [[U.S. Bank Tower (Sacramento)|U.S. Bank Tower]], two of the tallest buildings in the city, are located on Capitol Mall and are home to several major companies. The street is also home to major festivals such as the annual Farm to Fork Festival.

Sacramento's historic [[Japantown#United_States|Japantown]] once occupied much of today's Capitol Mall, spanning 4th street from K to P streets. The area suffered from the forced [[Internment of Japanese Americans|eviction]] of its Japanese residents during WW2 and never recovered, resulting in the remaining properties taken through eminent domain to create the grand promenade of today's [[Capitol_Mall#History|Capitol Mall]]. The [[Nisei VFW Post 8985|Nisei Memorial Hall]] at 4th and Q remains the last remaining property associated with Sacramento's former Japantown.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nisei VFW Post Designated as Historic Landmark |url=https://rafu.com/2021/04/nisei-vfw-post-designated-as-historic-landmark/ |publisher=Rafu Shimpo |date=27 April 2021}}</ref>

=====Downtown Commons=====
One of the newest districts in the city is [[Downtown Commons]]. Formerly home to the Downtown Plaza shopping mall, the district opened in 2016 along with [[Golden 1 Center]]. Downtown Commons, otherwise known as DOCO, is home to the Sawyer, a 16-story skyscraper with a 250-room hotel and 45 condominiums, a Macy's anchor store, an IMAX theater, and retail space with a variety of restaurants and shops.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.abc10.com/article/news/local/doco-announces-variety-of-new-shops-eateries-and-more/103-56edb69a-be36-456e-9ee1-f4c04a60997f |title=Toys R Us among new shops and restaurants coming to DOCO |last=Pearson |first=Mariah |date=November 8, 2022 |website=ABC10 |access-date=June 19, 2023}}</ref>

=====Downtown Sacramento=====
[[File:Sacramento aerial overview.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Sacramento, clearly showing the downtown/midtown grid and surrounding areas]]
{{See also|Downtown Sacramento}}
Downtown Sacramento is home to the [[Sacramento Convention Center Complex|SAFE Credit Union Convention Center and Theater]], Sacramento City Hall, the [[Sacramento Public Library]], and [[K Street (Sacramento)|K Street]], a historic street home to apartments, retail, and historical buildings. In addition, Downtown Sacramento is home to several hotels including the Citizen Hotel, housed in one of the first skyscrapers built in the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2019/09/11/citizen-hotel-sold-for-53-million-records-confirm.html |title=Citizen Hotel sold for $53 million, records confirm |last=Hamann |first=Emily |date=September 11, 2019 |website=Sacramento Business Journal |access-date=June 19, 2023 |archive-date=December 2, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221202005349/https://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2019/09/11/citizen-hotel-sold-for-53-million-records-confirm.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

=====East Sacramento=====
{{See also|East Sacramento}}
East Sacramento is a neighborhood in between Midtown and Sacramento State. This neighborhood is well known for being home to McKinley Park and Rose Garden and the Fabulous Forties, home to some of the most expensive, largest, and architecturally unique homes in the city. East Sacramento was home to [[Ronald Reagan]] during his term as Governor of California and this neighborhood was prominently featured in Greta Gerwig's film [[Lady Bird (film)|Lady Bird]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/news/lady-bird-movie-locations-sacramento |title=Check out hit movie Lady Bird's key locations in Sacramento |last=Smith |first=Andres |date=December 12, 2017 |website=Lonely Planet |access-date=June 19, 2023 |archive-date=July 31, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230731175252/https://www.lonelyplanet.com/news/lady-bird-movie-locations-sacramento |url-status=live }}</ref>

=====Historic Chinatown=====
The [[Opium Wars]] of the 1840s and 1850s, along with the Gold Rush, brought many Chinese people to California. Most arrived at San Francisco, which was then the largest city in California and known as "Daai Fau" ({{zh|c=大埠|j=daai<sup>6</sup> fau<sup>6</sup>|cy=Daaihfauh}}). Some eventually came to Sacramento, then the second-largest city in California and consequently called "Yee Fow" ({{zh|links=no|c=二埠 |j=ji<sup>6</sup> fau<sup>6</sup>}}). Today the city is known as "{{lang|zh-Hans|萨克拉门托}}" ({{zh|p=Sàkèlāméntuō}}) by mainland Chinese and as "{{lang|zh-Hant|沙加緬度}}" ''Sāgāmíhndouh'' and ''Shājiāmiǎnduó'' by Cantonese speakers and Taiwanese respectively.[[File:Sacramento Chinatown 溯源堂 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|Sacramento's historic Chinatown]]Sacramento's [[Chinatowns in the United States|Chinatown]] was on "I" Street from Second to Sixth Streets, called the [[China Slough]]. At the time, this area of "I" Street was considered a health hazard because, lying within a levee zone, it was lower than other parts of the city, which were situated on higher land. Throughout Sacramento's Chinatown history, there were fires, acts of discrimination, and prejudicial legislation such as the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] that was not repealed until 1943. The mysterious fires were thought to be set off by those who resented the Chinese working class.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/content?oid=344958 |title=Sacramento's Chinatown – News – Local Stories – June 28, 2007 |work=Sacramento News & Review |date=June 27, 2007 |access-date=November 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009230841/http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/Content?oid=344958 |archive-date=October 9, 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref> Ordinances on what was viable building material were set into place to try to get the Chinese to move out. Newspapers such as [[The Sacramento Union]] wrote stories at the time that portrayed the Chinese in an unfavorable light to inspire ethnic discrimination and drive the Chinese away.

=== Climate ===
[[File:American River at Sunrise Park, June 1974 (26251615404).jpg|thumb|right|The [[American River]] is popular for [[kayaking]] and [[recreational boating]].]]
Sacramento has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csa''), characterized by hot, long, dry summers and cool winters with a decent amount of rainfall. Most of the annual precipitation generally occurs from November to April, though there may be a day or two of light rainfall in May or October. The normal annual mean temperature is {{convert|61.8|°F|1}}, with the monthly daily average temperature ranging from {{convert|47.3|°F|1}} in December to {{convert|75.9|°F|1}} in July.<ref name="NCEI Summary of Monthly Normals - Airport - 1991-2020"/> Summer heat is sometimes moderated by a sea breeze known as the "delta breeze" which comes through the [[Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta]] from the [[San Francisco Bay]], and temperatures cool down sharply at night.

The foggiest months are December and January. [[Tule fog]] can be extremely dense, lowering visibility to less than {{convert|100|ft|sp=us}} and making driving conditions extremely hazardous. Chilling tule fog events have been known to last for several consecutive days or weeks. During Tule fog events, temperatures do not exceed {{convert|50|°F|0}}.
[[File:Farmers' market Sacramento.jpg|thumb|A [[Farmer's market|market]] at César Chávez Plaza]]
Snowfall is rare in Sacramento, which is only {{convert|25|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. In the downtown area, only three significant snow accumulations have occurred since 1900, the last one being in 1976.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capradio.org/articles/2011/02/24/forecasters-say-snow-possible-in-sacramento- |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20170525051541/http://archive2.capradio.org/articles/2011/02/24/forecasters-say-snow-possible-in-sacramento- |archive-date=May 25, 2017 |title=Forecasters Say Snow Possible in Sacramento |publisher=capradio.org |date=February 24, 2011 |access-date=November 16, 2012}}</ref> During especially cold winter and spring storms, intense showers do occasionally produce a significant amount of hail, which can create hazardous driving conditions. Snowfall in the city often melts upon ground contact, with traceable amounts occurring in some years. Significant annual snow accumulations occur in the foothills {{convert|40|mi|abbr=on}} east of the city, which had brief and traceable amounts of snowfall in January 2002, December 2009, and February 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0WLTW4tOXM |title=Snow in Sacramento |via=YouTube |date=December 19, 2009 |access-date=November 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707174722/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0WLTW4tOXM |archive-date=July 7, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2011/02/24/arctic-blast-could-bring-dusting-of-snow-to-sacramento-valley-and-several-feet-to-sierra/ "Arctic Blast Could Bring Dusting Of Snow To Sacramento Valley and Several Feet To Sierra"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019134754/http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2011/02/24/arctic-blast-could-bring-dusting-of-snow-to-sacramento-valley-and-several-feet-to-sierra/ |date=October 19, 2013}} CBS Sacramento</ref> The greatest snowfall ever recorded in Sacramento was {{convert|3|in|cm|1}} on January 5, 1888.

The average annual precipitation is {{convert|18.14|in|sp=us}}. On average, precipitation falls on 58 days each year in Sacramento, and nearly all of this falls during the winter months. Average January rainfall is {{convert|3.66|in|abbr=on}}, and measurable precipitation is rare during the summer months. In February 1992, Sacramento had 16 consecutive days of rain, resulting in an accumulation of {{convert|6.41|in|abbr=on}} for the period. On rare occasions, monsoonal moisture surges from the Desert Southwest can bring upper-level moisture to the Sacramento region, leading to increased summer cloudiness, humidity, and even light showers and thunderstorms. Monsoon clouds do occur, usually during late June through early September. Sacramento is the second most flood-susceptible city in the United States after New Orleans.<ref>{{cite magazine| url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2079360,00.html | magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | title=How the West May Flood: Winter's Long, Long Reach | date=June 27, 2011 | access-date=June 27, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630144526/http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2079360,00.html | archive-date=June 30, 2011}}</ref>

Sacramento has been noted as being the sunniest location on the planet for four months of the year, from May through August. It holds the distinction as the sunniest month, in terms of the percentage of possible sunshine, of anywhere in the world; July in Sacramento averages 14 hours and 12 minutes of sunshine per day, amounting to approximately 98% of possible sunshine.<ref>{{cite web |last=Osborn |first=Liz |url=http://www.currentresults.com/Weather-Extremes/sunniest-places-countries-world.php |title=Sunniest Places and Countries in the World |publisher=Current Results |access-date=November 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214191635/http://www.currentresults.com/Weather-Extremes/sunniest-places-countries-world.php |archive-date=February 14, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Port of Sacramento]] has been plagued with operating losses in recent years and faces bankruptcy. This severe loss in business is due to the heavy competition from the [[Port of Stockton]], which has a larger facility and a deeper channel. As of 2006, the city of [[West Sacramento, California|West Sacramento]] took responsibility for the Port of Sacramento. During the [[Vietnam War]] era, the Port of Sacramento was the major terminus in the supply route for all military parts, hardware, and other cargo going to Southeast Asia.

[[File:Wells Fargo Pavilion.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Wells Fargo Pavilion]] hosts the [[California Musical Theatre]] and the [[Sacramento Theatre Company]].]]
Professional theatre is represented in Sacramento by several companies. [[Broadway Sacramento]] and its locally produced [[summer stock theatre]], [[Broadway at Music Circus]], lures many directors, performers, and artists from New York and Los Angeles to work alongside a large local staff at the [[Wells Fargo Pavilion]]. During the fall, winter, and spring seasons Broadway Sacramento brings bus and truck tours to the [[SAFE Credit Union Performing Arts Center]]. Resident at the H Street Theatre Complex for the remainder of the year (from September to May), the [[Sacramento Theatre Company]] prepares to celebrate its 75th season, beginning in the Fall of 2019. In addition to a traditional regional theatre fare of classical plays and musicals, the Sacramento Theatre Company has a large School of the Arts with a variety of opportunities for arts education. The [[B Street Theatre]], having completed its 2018 move into the new Sophia Tsokopoulos Center for the Arts, continues its pursuit of producing smaller and more intimate professional works for families and children. Rounding out the professional companies is Capital Stage, which performed aboard the Delta King until the end of the 2010–2011 season and soon took up residence at its venue along the J-Street corridor.

The Sacramento area has one of the largest collections of community theatres in California. Some of these include the Thistle Dew Dessert Theatre and Playwrights Workshop, Davis Musical Theatre Co., El Dorado Musical Theatre, Runaway Stage Productions, River City Theatre Company, Flying Monkey Productions, The Actor's Theatre, KOLT Run Productions, Kookaburra Productions, Big Idea Theatre, Celebration Arts, Lambda Player, Light Opera Theatre of Sacramento, Synergy Stage and the historic Eagle Theatre.

[[Bicycling]] is an increasingly popular transportation mode in Sacramento, which enjoys a mild climate and flat terrain. Bicycling is especially common in the older neighborhoods of Sacramento's center, such as Alkali Flat, [[Midtown Sacramento|Midtown]], McKinley Park, [[Land Park]], and [[East Sacramento]]. Many employees who work downtown commute by bicycle from suburban communities on a dedicated bicycle path on the [[American River Parkway]]. Sacramento was designated as a Silver Level Bicycle Friendly Community by the [[League of American Bicyclists]] in September 2006. The advocacy organization [[Sacramento Area Bicycle Advocates]] co-sponsors the Sacramento Area Council of Governments' May is Bike Month campaign. Rideshare companies such as [[Lime (transportation company)|Lime]], [[Bird (transportation company)|Bird]], and [[Helbiz]] have introduced up to 4,000 electric-powered scooters and bikes in Downtown Sacramento for residents to rent as a faster and alternative way to get around the city. Sacramento ranks second worldwide in ride sharable, with ridership totaling 1 million riders in 8 months.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sacramentocityexpress.com/2020/02/07/sacramento-ranks-second-only-to-paris-in-this-category-and-its-not-about-trees/|title=Sacramento ranks second only to paris in this category (and it's not about trees) |last=Information Officer |first=Public |date=February 7, 2020 |website=Sacramento City Express |access-date=February 22, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article243788927.html|title=Electric Scooters are now back on Sacramento streets for rental.
