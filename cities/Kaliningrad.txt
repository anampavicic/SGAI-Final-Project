The city sits about {{convert|663|km|mi}} west of the bulk of [[Russia]]. The city is situated on the [[Pregolya|Pregolya River]], at the head of the [[Vistula Lagoon]] on the [[Baltic Sea]], and is the only ice-free Russian port on the Baltic Sea. Its population in 2020 was 489,359.<ref name=est.2020>{{cite web|title=Russia: Severo-Zapadnyj Federal'nyj Okrug: Northwestern Federal District|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/russia/cities/northwestern/|publisher=City Population.de|date=August 8, 2020|access-date=August 28, 2020}}</ref> Kaliningrad is the second-largest city in the [[Northwestern Federal District]], after [[Saint Petersburg]], the third-largest city in the [[Baltic region]], and the [[List of cities and towns around the Baltic Sea|seventh-largest city]] on the Baltic Sea.

Modern-day Kaliningrad was renamed, rebuilt and repopulated by Russians starting in 1946 in the ruins of Königsberg, in which only Lithuanian inhabitants were allowed to remain. Meanwhile, the German population was [[Ethnic cleansing|ethnically cleansed]], in effect creating a new city. Königsberg itself had been founded in 1255 on the site of the ancient [[Old Prussians|Old Prussian]] settlement ''Twangste'' by the [[Teutonic Knights]] during the [[Northern Crusades]], and named ''Königsberg'' in honor of King [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]]. A Baltic port city, it successively became the capital of the [[State of the Teutonic Order]], the [[Duchy of Prussia]] (1525–1701) and [[East Prussia]]. Königsberg remained the [[Coronation|coronation city]] of the Prussian monarchy, though the capital was moved to [[Berlin]] in 1701. From 1454 to 1455, the city under the name of ''Królewiec'' belonged to the [[History of Poland during the Jagiellonian dynasty|Kingdom of Poland]], and from 1466 to 1657 it was a Polish [[fief]]. Königsberg was the easternmost large city in [[Germany]] until [[World War II]]. The city was heavily damaged by [[Bombing of Königsberg in World War II|Allied bombing]] in 1944 and during the [[Battle of Königsberg]] in 1945; it was then captured by the [[Soviet Union]] on 9 April 1945. The [[Potsdam Agreement]] of 1945 placed it under Soviet administration. The city was renamed ''Kaliningrad'' in 1946 in honor of Russian Bolshevik leader [[Mikhail Kalinin]]. Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], it has been governed as the administrative centre of Russia's Kaliningrad Oblast, the westernmost [[oblast of Russia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bigenc.ru/geography/text/2035791|title=Кaliningrad|author=В.И.

==History==
{{For timeline}}
The history of the city may be divided into four periods: the [[Old Prussians|Old Prussian]] settlement known as ''Twangste'' before 1255; the [[Poland|Polish]] city of ''Królewiec'' from 1454 to 1455 and then fief of Poland from 1456 to 1657; the [[Germany|German]] city of ''Königsberg'' from 1657 to 1945; and the [[Classification of inhabited localities in Russia|Russian city]] of ''Kaliningrad'' from 1945 to present.

===Twangste===
{{stack|[[File:Prussian clans 13th century.png|thumb|[[Old Prussian]] clans in the 13th century (Sambia - orange)]]}}
Königsberg was preceded by a [[Sambians|Sambian]] ([[Old Prussians|Old Prussian]] tribe) fort called ''Twangste'' (Prussian word tvinksta means a pond made by a dam).<ref>Silvija Ozola.

The declining Old Prussian culture finally became extinct around the early 18th century with the Great Plague,<ref name="ReferenceA">Roqueplo O: La Russie & son miroir d'Extrême-Occident, HAL, 2018</ref> and the surviving Old Prussians were integrated through assimilation.

===Königsberg===
{{Main|Königsberg}}
The settlement on the site of present-day Kaliningrad was founded as a military fortress in 1255 after the [[Prussian Crusade]] by the [[Teutonic Knights]] against [[Old Prussians|Baltic Prussians]]. The new settlement was named in honor of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemian (Czech)]] [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|King Ottokar II]]. The crusade was followed by a settlement of Germans and the city became predominantly German, with [[Polish people|Polish]] (up to 30% in the 17th century),<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jasiński|first=Janusz|year=2005|title=Polska a Królewiec|journal=Komunikaty Mazursko-Warmińskie|volume=2|issue=1|language=pl|page=123}}</ref> [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvians|Latvian]] minorities.

In 1454, the city integrated within borders of Poland for a year thanks to King [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] as the capital of the [[Królewiec Voivodeship]], and became a fief of Poland from 1466, also considered part of "one and indivisible" Kingdom of Poland.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Górski|first=Karol|title=Związek Pruski i poddanie się Prus Polsce: zbiór tekstów źródłowych|year=1949|publisher=Instytut Zachodni|location=Poznań|language=pl,la|pages=54, 71–72, 96–97, 214–215}}</ref> After the [[secularization]] of the Teutonic Order in 1525, Königsberg became the capital of the [[Duchy of Prussia]], remaining under Polish suzerainty, and the black Prussian eagle had a crown around its neck bearing the letter "S" from the Latinized name of Polish King [[Sigismund I the Old]]. The multi-ethnic city was an important center of Polish and Lithuanian culture, especially as one of the pioneering centers of Polish and Lithuanian printing, and also thanks to the [[University of Königsberg]], the second-oldest university of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. In 1618 the Duchy of Prussia fell under the control of the [[Electors of Brandenburg]] and in 1657 it became controlled in personal union with Brandenburg (sometimes referred to as Brandenberg-Prussia). The city had strong ties with Poland, and Polish authorities several times confirmed and extended its rights in support against absolutist ambitions of the Prussian dukes, and after 1657 the city actively opposed secession from Poland.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Małłek|first=Janusz|year=1992|title=Polityka miasta Królewca wobec Polski w latach 1525–1701|magazine=Komunikaty Mazursko-Warmińskie|language=pl|issue=3–4|pages=249–250, 252–255}}</ref> The city acted as an intermediary in maritime trade between the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]], [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of France|France]], with the 17th-century stock exchange including a painting depicting a townswoman buying goods from a Pole and a Dutchman, embracing the notion that the city's prosperity was based on trade with the East and West, particularly Poland and the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jasiński|first=Janusz|year=2005|title=Polska a Królewiec|journal=Komunikaty Mazursko-Warmińskie|volume=2|issue=1|language=pl|page=131}}</ref>

From 1701, Brandenberg-Prussia became a Kingdom and the entire area was referred to as the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. While the Brandenberg portion was a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and later the [[German Confederation]], Prussia (later called East Prussia) was not included within those territorial boundaries. In 1734–1736, during the [[War of the Polish Succession]], it was the place of stay of Polish King [[Stanisław Leszczyński]] and many of his prominent supporters.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ciesielski|first=Tomasz|editor-last=Gieszczyński|editor-first=Witold|editor-last2=Kasparek|editor-first2=Norbert|year=2010|title=Wielkie wojny w Prusach.

In the context of the [[Seven Years' War]], the city was conquered and occupied by the [[Russian Empire]] (1758–1762),<ref name="ReferenceB">Roqueplo O. La Russie et son miroir d'Extrême-Occident, HAL, 2018</ref> whose initial plan was to offer the city and region to Poland as part of a territorial exchange desired by Russia.<ref>Ciesielski, p. 118</ref> [[Immanuel Kant]] is famous for having sworn allegiance to Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia]].<ref name="ReferenceB" />

In the ensuing two centuries the city, first as part of the Kingdom of Prussia, then from 1866 as part of the [[North German Confederation]], and then from 1871 as part of the [[German Empire]], continued to flourish and many iconic landmarks of Königsberg were built. The city had around 370,000 inhabitants and was a cultural and administrative center of Prussia and the German Empire. [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]], notable sons of the city, were born before this time. The first civil airport in Germany (Devau near Königsberg) opened 1919. In that time a new central railway station and modern buildings for the harbour and trade fair were built.

===World War II===
In [[World War II]], the city's Polish and Jewish populations were persecuted by [[Nazi Germany]] with mass arrests and deportations to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], and Poles and Jews were among [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labourers]] in the city. The city was heavily damaged by a [[Bombing of Königsberg in World War II|British bombing attack]]<ref name="ReferenceA"/> in 1944 and the [[Battle of Königsberg|massive Soviet siege in spring 1945]]. At the end of World War II in 1945, the city became part of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] (as part of the [[Soviet Union]]).

Under the [[Potsdam Agreement]] of 1 August 1945, the city became part of the [[Soviet Union]] pending the final determination of territorial borders. This final determination eventually took place on 12 September 1990 when the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany]] was signed. The excerpt from the initial agreement pertaining to the partition of East Prussia, including the area surrounding Königsberg, is as follows (note that Königsberg is spelt "Koenigsberg" in the original document):

<blockquote>'''VI. CITY OF KOENIGSBERG AND THE ADJACENT AREA'''<br />The Conference examined a proposal by the [[Politics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Government]] that pending the final determination of territorial questions at the peace settlement, the section of the western frontier of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics which is adjacent to the Baltic Sea should pass from a point on the eastern shore of the [[Gdańsk Bay|Bay of Danzig]] to the east, north of [[Braniewo|Braunsberg]]&nbsp;– [[Gołdap|Goldep]], to the meeting point of the frontiers of [[Lithuania]], the [[Poland|Polish Republic]] and [[East Prussia]].

The Conference has agreed in principle to the proposal of the Soviet Government concerning the ultimate transfer to the Soviet Union of the city of Koenigsberg and the area adjacent to it as described above, subject to expert examination of the actual frontier.

The [[Harry Truman|President of the United States]] and the [[Clement Attlee|British Prime Minister]] supported the proposal of the Conference at the forthcoming peace settlement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/policy/1945/450802a.html|title=The Potsdam Declaration|access-date=April 2, 2009}}</ref></blockquote>

Königsberg was renamed '''Kaliningrad''' in 1946 after the [[Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] of the USSR [[Mikhail Kalinin]], although Kalinin was unrelated to the city, and there were already cities named in honour of Kalinin in the Soviet Union, namely ''Kalinin'' (now Tver) and ''Kaliningrad'' (now [[Korolev, Moscow Oblast]]).<ref>[https://www.klgd.ru/city/history/almanac/a5_4.php Кёнигсберг мог стать Балтийском.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220201084522/https://www.klgd.ru/city/history/almanac/a5_4.php |date=February 1, 2022 }} // klgd.ru</ref><ref>[https://www.klgd.ru/city/history/almanac/a8_5.php Кёнигсберг-Калининград.

Some historians speculate that it may have originally been offered to the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuanian SSR]] because the resolution from the conference specifies that Kaliningrad's border would be at the (pre-war) Lithuanian frontier. The remaining German population was [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|forcibly expelled]] between 1947 and 1948.

The German language was replaced with the Russian language. In 1950, there were 1,165,000 inhabitants, which was only half the number of the pre-war population.

From 1953 to 1962, a monument to Stalin stood on Victory Square. In 1973, the town hall was turned into the House of Soviets. In 1975, the trolleybus was launched again. In 1980, a concert hall was opened in the building of the former Lutheran Church of the Holy Family. In 1986, the Kreuzkirche building was transferred to the Russian Orthodox Church.

For foreigners, the city was [[Closed city|completely closed]] and, with the exception of rare visits of friendship from neighboring Poland, it was practically not visited by foreigners.<ref>[http://window.edu.ru/window/library/pdf2txt?p_id=5810 Социально-экономическая география Балтийского региона.] // window.edu.ru</ref><ref>[http://www.newkaliningrad.ru/news/politics/k95640.html Калининград: От реликта России до процветающего города Прибалтики («The Independent», Великобритания).] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827151959/http://www.newkaliningrad.ru/news/politics/k95640.html |date=August 27, 2016 }} // newkaliningrad.ru</ref>

The reconstruction of the oblast, threatened by hunger in the immediate post-war years, was carried out through an ambitious policy of oceanic fishing<ref>Roqueplo O: La Russie et son Miroir d'Extrême-Occident, Langues'O, HAL, 2018</ref> with the creation of one of the main fishing harbours of the USSR in Kaliningrad city.

The region was added as a [[enclave and exclave|semi-exclave]] to the Russian SFSR; since 1946 it has been known as the Kaliningrad Oblast.

The town of [[Baltiysk]], just outside Kaliningrad, is the only Russian [[Baltic Sea]] port said to be "ice-free" all year round, and the region hence plays an important role in maintenance of the [[Baltic Fleet]].

Kaliningrad Oblast was an [[exclave]] of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] and with the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 it became separated from the rest of Russia by independent countries. This isolation from the rest of Russia became even more pronounced politically when Poland and Lithuania became members of [[NATO]] and subsequently the [[European Union]] [[Enlargement of the European Union|in 2004]]. All military and civilian land links between the region and the rest of Russia have to pass through members of NATO and the EU. Special travel arrangements for the territory's inhabitants have been made through the ''Facilitated Transit Document (FTD)'' and ''Facilitated Rail Transit Document (FRTD)''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=LEGISSUM%3Al14557 |title=Facilitated transit document (FTD) and facilitated rail transit document (FRTD) |work=EUR-lex |date=2020-01-07 |access-date=2020-07-05}}</ref>

==Geography==
Kaliningrad is at the mouth of the navigable [[Pregolya River]], which empties into the [[Vistula Lagoon]], an inlet of the [[Baltic Sea]].

Sea vessels can access [[Gdańsk Bay]] and the [[Baltic Sea]] by way of the Vistula Lagoon and the [[Strait of Baltiysk]].

Until around 1900, ships drawing more than {{convert|2|m|sp=us}} of water could not pass the bar and use the city's docks;{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} larger vessels had to anchor at Pillau (now [[Baltiysk]]), where cargo was transferred to smaller vessels. In 1901, a [[ship canal]] between Königsberg and Pillau, completed at a cost of 13&nbsp;million German marks,{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} enabled vessels of a {{convert|6.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}} draught to moor alongside the town (see also [[Ports of the Baltic Sea]]).

===Climate===
Kaliningrad has an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'', depending on the isotherm chosen for class ''C'' climates) or a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfb'', depending on the isotherm chosen for class ''D'' climates), with cold and cloudy (though moderate compared to most of Russia) winters and mild summers with frequent showers and thunderstorms. Average temperatures range from {{convert|-1.5|to|+18.1|C|F|abbr=on}} and rainfall varies from {{convert|36.0|mm|sp=us}}/month to {{convert|97.0|mm|sp=us}}/month. In general, it has [[oceanic climate|maritime]] influences and therefore damp, variable and mild, with vast temperature differences between July and January.

The seasons are clearly differentiated. Spring starts in March and is initially cold and windy, later becoming pleasantly warm and often very sunny. Summer, which begins in June, is predominantly warm but hot at times (with temperatures reaching as high as {{convert|+30|-|+35|C}} at least once per year) with plenty of sunshine interspersed with heavy showers. The average annual hours of sunshine for Kaliningrad is 1,700, similar to other northern cities. Autumn comes in September and is at first warm and usually sunny, turning cold, damp and foggy in November.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Winter includes periods of snow. January and February are the coldest months with the temperature sometimes dropping as low as {{convert|-15|C}}.

The pre-war city center (Altstadt and Kneiphof) consists of parks, broad avenues, a square on the site of the former [[Königsberg Castle]], and the restored [[Königsberg Cathedral]] on the Kneiphof island (now "Kant island"). Immanuel Kant's grave is situated next to the cathedral. The never-finished [[House of Soviets (Kaliningrad)|House of Soviets]] ("Dom Sovyetov") sat roughly on the site of the former castle before its demolition in 2023-24. Many German-era buildings in the historic city centre have been preserved and even rebuilt, including the reconstruction of the [[Königsberg Synagogue]]. The new city centre is concentrated around [[Victory Square, Kaliningrad|Victory Square]]. The [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (Kaliningrad)|Cathedral of Christ the Savior]], consecrated in 2005, is located on that square.

The oldest building in Kaliningrad is the [[Juditten Church]] (built before 1288).

Only the gate of the former [[Fort Friedrichsburg]] remains.

== Transport ==

=== Roads ===
Kaliningrad is a major transport hub. [[Russian federal highways|The most important roads of the city are]]:

*[[File:A229-RUS.svg|45px]] Kaliningrad – [[Chernyakhovsk]]–[[Nesterov]] to the [[Lithuania–Russia border]] (on to [[Vilnius]], [[Minsk]], route M1 "Belarus") It is a part of the branches of the trans-European transport corridors No. 1-A "Riga–Kaliningrad–Gdansk" and No. 9-D "Kiev–Minsk–Vilnius–Kaliningrad", [[File:Tabliczka E28.svg|32px|link=European route E28]] and [[File:Tabliczka E77.svg|32px|link=European route E77]]
*[[File:A216-RUS.svg|45px]] Kaliningrad – [[Gvardeisk]] – [[Neman]] to the Lithuania–Russia border (on to [[Šiauliai]], [[Jelgava]], [[Riga]]). The route from the village – [[Talpaki]], through [[Bolshakovo]] to [[Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Sovetsk]]. It is a part of the branch of the trans-European transport corridor No. 1-A "Riga–Kaliningrad–Gdansk". [[File:Tabliczka E28.svg|32px|link=European route E28]]
*Kaliningrad – [[Mamonovo]]. Through [[Ladushkin]] to the [[Poland-Russia border]] (to [[Elbląg]], [[Gdańsk]]). [[File:Tabliczka E28.svg|32px|link=European route E28]] and [[File:Tabliczka E77.svg|32px|link=European route E77]]
*Kaliningrad – [[Polessk]]. It follows through the village. Bolshakovo (further to Sovetsk)
*Kaliningrad – [[Zelenogradsk]]. (further along the [[Curonian Spit]] to [[Nida, Lithuania|Nida]] and [[Klaipėda]])
*Kaliningrad – [[Baltiysk]]. The road runs through [[Primorsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Primorsk]].
*Kaliningrad – [[Bagrationovsk]]. Leads to the Polish border (further to [[Olsztyn]]).

In December 2007, construction began on the Primorskoye Koltso highway, which connects Kaliningrad with [[Svetlogorsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Svetlogorsk]], [[Pionersky, Kaliningrad Oblast|Pionersky]], Zelenogradsk and [[Khrabrovo Airport]]. It is planned to continue construction at Baltiysk, [[Svetly, Kaliningrad Oblast|Svetly]].

Around the city (from the village of A. Kosmodemyansky to the traffic intersection with Moskovsky Prospekt) passes the route of the northern and southern bypasses of Kaliningrad. Until now, on the western side of the city of Kaliningrad, the "ring" of the road has not been closed due to the absence of a {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us|adj=on}} crossing through the [[Vistula Lagoon]].

=== Water ===
Kaliningrad is home to the westernmost and the only non-freezing port of [[Russia]] and the [[Baltic states]] on the [[Baltic Sea]]. Freight and passenger ferry crossings connect the Port of Kaliningrad, and its outport, the [[Baltiysk|Port of Baltiysk]] with [[Saint Petersburg]], and the ports of [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]].

As of April 2019, only a freight ferry operates on the Baltiysk–Ust-Luga route, and the passenger ferry has been cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.transbc.ru/ferry-line/|title=Паром Калининград – Санкт-Петербург.

=== Air ===
[[File:Kaliningrad 05-2017 img76 Khrabrovo Airport.jpg|thumb|[[Khrabrovo Airport]]]]
The [[Kaliningrad Devau Airport]], which opened in 1919, was one of the first civilian airports in the world, and the first in Germany. In 1922, the first planes of the Moscow-Riga-Königsberg, the first international airline of the Soviet Union, arrived in here for the first time. After [[World War II]], the airport was used for local flights until the 1970s.

In the fifties, a new airport, the [[Khrabrovo Airport]], was built on the base of a military airfield {{convert|24|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} from the city. Now it has international status. The Kaliningrad airline KD Aviation was based on Khrabrovo, which ceased operations in September 2009. The reconstruction of the airport has been completed in 2018.{{Citation needed|date=November 2022}} On 1 October 2022 the airport began [[Freedoms of the air|allowing more flights]] from international destinations, including through operation by foreign airlines.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://balkaninsight.com/2022/11/02/fearing-new-hybrid-war-front-poland-to-build-wall-on-kaliningrad-border/ |title=Fearing New Hybrid War Front, Poland to Build Wall on Kaliningrad Border |author=Claudia Ciobanu |work=Balkan Insight |date=2 November 2022 |access-date=21 November 2022}}</ref>

=== Railway ===
{{Main|Kaliningrad Railway}}
[[File:Kaliningrad 05-2017 img36 South railway station.jpg|thumb|[[Kaliningrad South railway station]]]]
[[File:Kaliningrad RZD 2019.png|thumb|Railway network in Kaliningrad Oblast]]
Kaliningrad is the most important hub of the railway network of the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]]. It is the site of the Kaliningrad Railway.

The main passenger railway station of the city is the Kaliningrad South railway station, which includes the main railway station of the city and the Oblast–Yuzhny station, it serves both commuter and long-distance trains following from Kaliningrad:

*No. 30 [[Moscow]] "Yantar"
*No. 80 [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]
*No. 148 Moscow (summer)
*No. 360 [[Adler Microdistrict|Adler]]
*No. 426 [[Chelyabinsk]] (summer)

The [[Berlin]]-Kaliningrad direct train (via Poland) operated from 1993 to 2000, then was replaced by a through carriage, which was part of the Kaliningrad-[[Gdynia]] train from December 2003 to December 2009 and in 2010–2013 (in the summer), with a re-railer in the Polish city of [[Tczew]]. A platform with a European [[Standard Gauge]] track was specially equipped to receive these trains, allowing trains to run on this route without the interruption of a [[bogie exchange]] at some point on the journey.

[[File:Kaliningrad 05-2017 img55 North station.jpg|thumb|[[Kaliningrad North railway station]]]]
Kaliningrad North railway station serves trains connecting Kaliningrad with the seaside resorts of the city, [[Svetlogorsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Svetlogorsk]] and [[Pionersky, Kaliningrad Oblast|Pionersky]], as well as the city of [[Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Sovetsk]]. It is a major transport hub in the public transport system of Kaliningrad.

Other railway stations located in the city:
*[[Kutuzovo-Novoye railway station|Kutuzovo-Novoye]] (Alexander Nevsky Street District)
*Chkalovsk-Western (Mck. Chkalovsk)
*West New (Wagon Street District)
*Forest-Novoya (Mcn. named after Alexander Kosmodemyansky)
*Dzerzhinskaya-Novaya (Dzerzhinsky Street district, there is a European (standard gauge) track)
*Aivazovsky stop (in the area of Aivazovsky and Yamskaya streets)
*Kiev stop (Kievskaya Street district, near the Baltic market)
*Selma stop (General Chelnokov Street and Selma Market)

*Brusnichny Stop (Brusny street district)

=== Inter-city and international bus service ===
Regular bus routes connect Kaliningrad with [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], [[Poland]], the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Germany]].

There are two bus stations in the city. The "old" bus station is located on Kalinin Square, next to the Kaliningrad-Passazhirskiy railway station and is used primarily for intra-regional transportation.

Due to the conflict with the station directorate, the Königavto road carrier stopped using this bus station and set up its own international bus station at the end of Moskovsky Prospekt. More than 90% of regular international bus services depart from it.

=== Urban public transport ===
Public transport in Kaliningrad is represented by a bus, a trolleybus, a tram, a taxi, and the city's railway lines. On 21 March 2010 a new public transport scheme came into effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kgd.ru/news/analytics/item/3142-transportnyj-tupik|title=Транспортный тупик: новая маршрутная сеть Калининграда|publisher=KGB.ru|author=Константин Киврин|date=March 15, 2010|access-date=August 4, 2020}}</ref>

The [[Trams in Kaliningrad|tram network in Kaliningrad]] has been in existence since 1895 and is the oldest tram system in Russia. It has a track width of {{convert|1000|mm|ftin|abbr=on}}. Until 2000, at least ten city tram routes operated in Kaliningrad, however, over the past twenty years, the route network has been significantly reduced.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newkaliningrad.ru/news/community/k1007880.html|title=В Калининграде отменяют два маршрута трамвая и троллейбуса|publisher=newkaliningrad.ru|date=January 10, 2010|access-date=August 4, 2020}}</ref> By the beginning of 2013, only two routes were operating in the city. In 2015, after changing the traffic pattern at the [[Kaliningrad South railway station]], the last tram route No. 5 remained. In accordance with the newly adopted General Plan of Kaliningrad until 2035, the construction of a tram line with a separate traffic section in the Moskovsky District is envisaged.

The first trolleybuses appeared in Königsberg in 1943, but after the war they decided not to restore the trolleybus system. The modern trolleybus system of the city has been operating since 5 November 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data9.gallery.ru/albums/gallery/199215-f2327-22085722-.jpg|title=Из истории "рогатых": "Советский троллейбус в Кёнигсберге"|publisher=data9.gallery.ru|author=Юрий Грозмани|date=December 9, 2004|access-date=August 4, 2020}}</ref> During this time, the route network in Kaliningrad has repeatedly changed. After the repair of the overpass on Pobedy Avenue, carried out in the summer of 2018, route No. 6 was discontinued. As a result, three operating trolleybus lines remained in the city, although the new route scheme for public transport, adopted on 1 August 2016, provided for six routes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tr.ru/news/1496-novaya-marshrutnaya-set-v-kaliningrade-nachnyot-deystvovat-s-avgusta|title=Новая маршрутная сеть в Калининграде начнёт действовать с августа|publisher=TR.ru|author=Юлия Лунская|date=July 14, 2016|access-date=August 4, 2020}}</ref> The general plan of the city until 2035 also provides for the development of the trolleybus network in Kaliningrad.

==== Railbus ====
[[File:Kaliningrad Brandenburg Gate.JPG|thumb|A [[Tatra T4]] Tram passing through the [[Brandenburg Gate (Kaliningrad)|Brandenburg Gate]]]]
On 26 March 2014 the first line of the city rail bus was launched in Kaliningrad, serving the route from the Kievskaya platform in the Moskovsky district to the [[Kaliningrad North railway station]]. At the same time, a bus line was organised connecting Oleg Koshevoy Street with the Kievskaya platform. The opening of several more lines of the city railway has been announced, which should connect the center of Kaliningrad with the peripheral districts of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://klops.ru/news/avto/88362-v-kaliningrade-otkrylas-pervaya-vetka-nazemnogo-metro|title=В Калининграде открылась первая ветка наземного метро|publisher=Klops.ru|date=March 26, 2014|access-date=August 4, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://kgd.ru/news/item/34233-s-26-marta-v-kaliningrade-nachnjot-hodit-relsobus-s-ul-kievskoj-do-severnogo-vokzala|title=С 26 марта в Калининграде начнёт ходить рельсобус с ул.

In December 2016, the mayor of Kaliningrad, Alexander Yaroshuk, announced that from 1 January 2017 the city rail bus would be canceled due to its unprofitability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kgd.ru/news/society/item/59712-vlasti-kaliningrada-reshili-otmenit-relsobus-s-severnogo-vokzala-na-ulicu-kievskuyu|title=Власти Калининграда решили отменить рельсобус с Северного вокзала на улицу Киевскую|publisher=KGD.ru|author=Денис Костоглодов|date=December 20, 2016|access-date=August 4, 2020}}</ref> After that, Governor [[Anton Alikhanov]] made an operational decision to subsidize the rail bus from the regional budget.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kgd.ru/news/transport/item/59821-oblastnoe-pravitelstvo-reshilo-zabrat-u-kaliningrada-marshrut-relsobusa|title=Областное правительство решило забрать у Калининграда маршрут рельсобуса|publisher=KGD.ru|author=Елена Калугина|date=December 23, 2016|access-date=August 4, 2020}}</ref>

In early January 2017, the press service of the Kaliningrad Railway announced that it was planned to extend the rail bus line to [[Chkalovsk Microdistrict|Chkalovsk]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://kgd.ru/news/transport/item/60132-marshrut-relsobusa-ot-ulicy-kievskoj-prodlyat-do-chkalovska|title=Маршрут рельсобуса от улицы Киевской продлят до посёлка Чкаловск|publisher=KGD.ru|date=January 8, 2017|access-date=August 4, 2020}}</ref>

On 9 January 2017 city trains were launched on the Kaliningrad-Guryevsk route, and on the Kaliningrad-Lesnoye Novoe route from 3 September 2018.

As of the end of 2018, rail buses serve four intra-city lines connecting peripheral sleeping areas and the satellite city of [[Guryevsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Guryevsk]] with the center of Kaliningrad. Kaliningrad North railway station is a major transport and interchange hub, where many public transport routes converge. Passengers are transported by rail buses of the [[RA1 (railbus)|RA1]] and [[RA2 Multiple Unit|RA2]] models, manufactured by [[Metrovagonmash]]. City trains run on weekdays during the morning and evening rush hours.

=== Bridges ===
[[File:Kaliningrad 05-2017 img41 Reichsbahn Bridge.jpg|thumb|180px|The Two-tiered Bridge]]
[[File:2011-03-24 at 13-56-43.jpg|thumb|180px|The Wooden Bridge]]
[[File:Vtoraya estakada Kaliningrad.jpg|thumb|180px|Second Overpass Bridge]]
The branches of the [[Pregolya River]] divide the city into four parts. Majority of the city ([[Tsentralny Administrative District, Kaliningrad|Tsentralny Administrative District]] and [[Leningradsky Administrative District, Kaliningrad|Leningradsky Administrative District]]) is located north of the river, [[Moskovsky Administrative District, Kaliningrad|Moskovsky Administrative District]] is south of the river. Kant Island ([[Kneiphof]]) and [[Oktyabrsky Administrative District, Kaliningrad|Oktyabrsky Administrative District]] ([[Lomse]]) are located between the branches of the river.

There are eight active bridges across the Pregolya and one dismantled in Kaliningrad.
* The Two-tiered bridge is a drawbridge that connects General Butkov (northern bank) and Zheleznodorozhnaya (southern bank) streets. Divorced by raising the middle span. The upper tier of the bridge is occupied by a railway, the lower - by the carriageway and pedestrian sidewalks. The double-deck bridge is the only existing railway bridge across the Pregolya in Kaliningrad.
* Trestle bridge - thrown over both branches of the Pregolya and passes over Kneiphof, is part of the Leninsky Prospekt, built in 1972,<ref>Исторический календарь Калининграда // Журнал «Запад России», № 1 (18) 1997 год, стр 40.</ref> to replace two of the seven Königsberg bridges - Lavochny and Zeleny. There is a pedestrian descent from the bridge to the island, an automobile exit to Moskovsky Prospekt. There is no road exit to the island. The bridge is crossed by routes of all types of public transport.
* The Wooden Bridge is a drawbridge, one of the seven bridges in Königsberg. Connects Moskovsky Prospekt with Oktyabrsky Island (Oktyabrskaya st.). There are two tram routes across the bridge
* The Honey Bridge is a drawbridge, one of the seven bridges of Königsberg. Connects Oktyabrsky Island and Kneiphof. Since the Kneiphof is a pedestrian zone, the de facto bridge is also exclusively pedestrian. From time to time, the bridge is used by official vehicles (delivery of materials for the restoration of the [[Königsberg Cathedral]], as well as for the passage of wedding corteges).
* Jubilee Bridge - drawbridge, pedestrian, connects Oktyabrsky Island (Rybnaya village area) with St. Epronovskaya. Built in 2005 on the pillars of the old Imperial Bridge, destroyed during [[World War II]].
* The High Bridge is one of the seven bridges in Königsberg. Connects st. Oktyabrskaya (Oktyabrsky Island) from st. Dzerzhinsky. A tram line runs across the bridge.
* Berlin (Palmburg) Bridge is part of the Kaliningrad ring road, it is thrown across both channels of the Pregolya. Farthest from the city center. After the war, it was only partially restored (one strip). A three-lane bridge was built in its place, reconstructed in 2014.
* The old railway bridge is a drawbridge, located in the area of the Museum of the World Ocean. Divorced by raising the middle span. The middle span is dismantled, the bridge is not used in any way. An abandoned railway line crosses the bridge.
* The Second Overpass Bridge was commissioned in December 2011. The bridge crosses both channels of the Pregolya and passes over Oktyabrsky Island, connecting April 9 Street in the right-bank part of the city with Dzerzhinsky Street in the left-bank part. The total length is {{convert|1883|m|yd|abbr=off}}. The bridge has three lanes in each direction. The design speed of vehicles is not less than {{convert|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.

Seven bridges existed in [[Königsberg]] in the 16th-20th centuries. The relative position of the bridges led to the mathematical problem of [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]], and prompted the mathematician [[Leonhard Euler]] to speculate, which led to the emergence of [[graph theory]].
