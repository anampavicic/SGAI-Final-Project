'''Palu''', officially known as the '''City of Palu''' ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Kota Palu''), is the [[capital city|capital]] and largest city of [[Central Sulawesi]] Province in [[Indonesia]]. Palu is located on the northwestern coast of [[Sulawesi]] and borders [[Donggala Regency]] to the north and west, [[Parigi Moutong Regency]] to the east, and [[Sigi Regency]] to the south. The city boundaries encompass a land area of {{convert|395.06|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. According to the [[2020 Indonesian census]], Palu had a population of 373,218, making it the third-most populous city on the island after [[Makassar]] and [[Manado]]; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 387,493 - comprising 194,340 males and 193,150 females.<ref>Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2024.</ref> Palu is the center of finance, government, and education in Central Sulawesi, as well as one of several major cities on the island. The city hosts the province's main port, its biggest airport, and most of its public universities.

Palu is located in [[Palu Bay]]; it was initially a small agricultural town until it was selected to become the capital of the newly created province of Central Sulawesi in 1953. Palu is sited on the [[Palu-Koro Fault]] and is frequently struck by earthquakes, such as the [[2018 Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami|2018 Sulawesi earthquake]]. According to Indonesia's [[National Agency for Disaster Countermeasure|National Disaster Management Agency]], the 2018 earthquake caused "the largest natural [[soil liquefaction]] phenomenon in the world".<ref name="BNPB-LargestSoilLiq"/> Much of the city's infrastructure was destroyed and large swathes of land were rendered uninhabitable,<ref name="uninhabitable"/> prompting the local government to plan to relocate the city to a safer location instead of rebuilding in the same place.<ref name="KotaPaluBaru"/>

== History ==
Palu was founded as an agricultural town and had been less significant than the then-bigger town of [[Donggala]] around {{Convert|35|km|miles|abbr=on}} away.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book |first=Sulaiman |last=Mamar |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/15864232 |title=Sejarah sosial daerah Sulawesi Tengah (wajah kota Donggala dan Palu) |date=1984–1985 |publisher=Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, Direktorat Sejarah dan Nilai Tradisional, Proyek Inventarisasi dan Dokumentasi Sejarah Nasional |oclc=15864232}}</ref> The creation of Palu was initiated by people from several villages around Ulayo Mountain. There are different accounts of the origin of the city's name; according to one explanation, it came from the word ''topalu'e'', which means "raised land"; another version states it was derived from the word ''volo'', the name of local bamboo plants.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Putong |first=Ady |date=2018-10-02 |title=Kota Palu Dan Misteri Topalu'e yang Berarti Tanah Terangkat |url=https://barta1.com/v2/2018/10/02/kota-palu-dan-misteri-topalue-yang-berarti-tanah-terangkat/ |access-date=2022-05-07 |website=Barta1.com |language=id-ID}}</ref>

=== Early history ===
The early history of Palu and its surroundings can be divided into the Tomalanggai Era, the Tomanuru Era, and the Independent Era.<ref name=":3"/>

During the Tomalanggai Ere which lasted until the founding of Kaili Kingdom in the 15th century,<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Septiwiharti |first=Dwi |title=Budaya Sintuvu Masyarakat Kaili di Sulawesi Tengah &#91;The Sintuvu Culture of the Kaili People in Central Sulawesi&#93; |date=2020-08-04 |url=https://naditirawidya.kemdikbud.go.id/index.php/nw/article/view/419 |journal=Naditira Widya |language=id |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=47–64 |doi=10.24832/nw.v14i1.419 |issn=2548-4125|doi-access=free }}</ref> most of the inhabitants were [[hunter-gatherer]]s and relatively violent. Due to scarce resources, many tribal groups waged war against each other, and the losing group would need to settle with the winner and work for them. The leaders of these early settlers were called ''Tomalanggai''. The power structure was not yet formalized; the ''Tomalanggai'' were essentially absolute rulers with no limits of power, which caused frequent wars and rebellions.<ref name=":3" /> The following Tomanuru Era, in which power was consolidated and village structures became formalized, several reforms were made and life was relatively peaceful. According to local legend, during this era, villages were ruled by descendants of gods from heaven. It was said a ''Tomalanggai'' one day wanted golden bamboos, which grew around the region, for his water container and commanded his troops to chop all of them. After the bamboo were chopped down, a storm suddenly came but soon stopped; after the storm, a beautiful women appeared where the bamboo was. The ''Tomalanggai'' took her to his village and married her, and their descendant was wiser and stronger than his father. The name of the period roughly means "the one that brings blessing". This period lasted until about the 16th century. During this era, an aristocratic class called the ''madika'' appeared within Kaili society.<ref name=":3" /> 

After the Tomanuru Era, the region experienced another historical period Indonesian historians called "''zaman Merdeka''" or the Independent Era. During this time, kingdoms in the region started to have trade contacts with the outside world and several signs of an early form of democratic government. Kingdoms in the region were no longer led by single power entity; power was devolved to several representative bodies and councils. The power structure was divided into ''magau'' (kings) who lead the kingdoms, ''madika'' were nobles who led districts, and ''kapala'' who led villages. Kingdoms had structures such as ''patanggota'' (four officials), ''pitunggota'' (seven officials), and ''walunggota'' (nine officials), referring to the number of ministries beside the king who managed the kingdom. Kingdoms around the region also developed military structures with full-time officers and commanders. This era lasted roughly until the arrival of the Dutch in the region.<ref name=":3" />

Kingdoms in the region during this period included Bangga Kingdom and Pakawa Kingdom, which were located around {{Convert|30|km|miles|abbr=on}} from the modern-day location of the city. Other kingdoms in the region, particularly in the [[Palu Valley]], were Palu Kingdom, Tawaeli, Bora, and Sigi. Bangga and Sigi Kingdoms were among the biggest and most powerful, acting as regional powers.<ref name=":3" />

=== Colonial era ===
[[File:A couple in Palu 1920.png|left|thumb|A couple in Palu, 1920]]
[[File:Palu Map 1941.png|thumb|Map of Palu, 1941]]

Contact with Europeans, particularly Portuguese, occurred since the late 16th century, mainly for trading and rights to use ports. Portuguese influence is evident in several communities of Kaili people, particularly in the region that used to be under the Kulawi Kingdom, around {{Convert|80|km|miles|abbr=on}} from Palu, where dress that resembles that of the Portuguese is worn.<ref name=":3" /> Contact with the Dutch began in the 19th century when the Portuguese influence in the region had waned. The first kingdom to sign a contract with the Dutch was the Sigi Kingdom, which signed a ''Large Kontrack'' in 1863 and ''Karte Verklaring'' in 1917. The kingdom of Banawa also signed ''Large Kontrack'' in 1888 and ''Kartte Verklaring'' in 1904. Other smaller kingdoms soon followed by signing the same contracts and agreements. Between 1863 and 1908, practically all kingdoms in the region were under the influence of the Dutch and were soon incorporated into the [[Dutch East Indies]].<ref name=":3" /> There was some local resistance, such as the Donggala War in 1902, which was led by [[:id:Tombolotutu|King Tombolotutu]]; the Sigi War between 1905 and 1908 led by King Toi Dompu; and the Kulawi War between 1904 and 1908. The native kingdoms were mostly defeated in the war and there would be no further significant resistance from the natives until 1942.<ref name=":3" />

=== World War II and National Revolution ===
[[File:Portrait of Nani Wartabone, Sulawesi Utara Bergolak, p34.jpg|thumb|Nani Wartabone, a key figure in Merah Putih Movement]]

In 1942, influenced by [[World War II]] and the rising Indonesian nationalism movement, an uprising referred to as ''Merah Putih Movement'' (lit: Red and White Movement) appeared in the region. The uprising in this region started on 25 January 1942 when a local Dutch colonial police chief was killed and several officials were taken hostage by the movement. In Central Sulawesi, the movement  was closely connected to the one organized by [[Nani Wartabone]] in [[Gorontalo]] about the same time. The movement controlled the region of the former Kulawi Kingdom and was supported by ex-nobles from the region. The Kingdom of Kulawi was revived and royal troops were mobilized to support the nationalist cause. The movement's stronghold was in Momi Mountain, across the [[Miu River]]. As the result of the movement, Toi Torengke the King of Kulawi was arrested. On 1 February 1942, the movement raised the Indonesian flag at [[Tolitoli Regency|Tolitoli]] and played [[Indonesia Raya]], resulting in an assault by the Dutch military and the killing of several nationalist figures in the region. The movement soon spread to other regions such as [[Luwuk]] and [[Poso]]. The Red and White Movement pledged its allegiance to the National Government, a provisional Indonesian government set up by Nani Wartabone in Gorontalo. Following the Dutch East Indies' conquest by the [[Empire of Japan]], the Red and White Movement collapsed as result of the arrest of Nani Wartabone by Japanese forces. The nationalist movement in Sulawesi was suppressed and seen with suspicion by [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], which occupied the region, unlike other regions such as Java and Sumatra, which were under control of the Japanese army.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Elson |first=Robert Edward |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VoE_kJ4le2IC&q=Borneo+en+de+Groote-Oost&pg=PR232 |title=The Idea of Indonesia |date=2009 |publisher=Penerbit Serambi |isbn=978-979-024-105-3 |language=id |access-date=8 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210510143702/https://books.google.co.id/books?id=VoE_kJ4le2IC&lpg=PR232&dq=Borneo+en+de+Groote-Oost&pg=PR232&hl=id#v=onepage&q=Borneo%20en%20de%20Groote-Oost&f=false |archive-date=10 May 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":3" /><ref name="Kahin355">Kahin (1952), p. 355</ref>

Following the surrender of Japan and [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence]] in [[Jakarta]], a paramilitary organization named Laskar Tanjumbulu was formed by surviving fighters of the previous Merah Putih Movement. The paramilitaries took over several Japanese military facilities and weapons while distributing news about Indonesian Independence. The remaining Japanese officials transferred governance to several native kings in the region including Palu before leaving. Some of these kings later supported an Indonesian republic and created difficulties for the returning Dutch administration. The King of Palu and Parigi accepted the return of the Dutch administration, which landed in Palu in late 1945. On 31 January 1946, a widespread repression of the nationalist movement occurred. The region, including the city, later became part of [[State of East Indonesia]] until the [[Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference]], at which the Dutch acknowledged Indonesian sovereignty and the State of East Indonesia was disbanded one year later.<ref name=":3" /> In Palu, the dissolution of the State of East Indonesia and return to a unitary republic occurred in a building today called Gedung Juang.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gedung Juang Saksi Bisu Kemerdekaan di Sulawesi Tengah |url=https://www.kompas.tv/article/102532/gedung-juang-saksi-bisu-kemerdekaan-di-sulawesi-tengah |access-date=2022-06-08 |website=KOMPAS.tv |language=id}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=2020-03-12 |editor-last=Putri |editor-first=Arum Sutrisni |title=Kembali ke Negara Kesatuan Halaman all |url=https://www.kompas.com/skola/read/2020/03/12/173000869/kembali-ke-negara-kesatuan |access-date=2022-06-08 |website=KOMPAS.com |language=id}}</ref><ref name=":3" />

=== Modern history ===
[[File:Market in Palu, 1958.png|thumb|Scene of a traditional market in Palu, 1958]]
While the city had a Dutch official seat during the colonial era, Palu was still by this time a small agriculture town with little significance, while Central Sulawesi region's economic and political activities were centered around Poso and Donggala.<ref name=":3" /> The center of economic activity in the region shifted when the larger Pantoloan Port was built in Palu Bay, and an airport which today become [[Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport]]. The construction of Pantoloan Port which competed with the older Donggala Port initially were met with objections especially from ship owners and officials in Donggala.<ref name=":3" /> Palu's population grew dramatically in the 1950s and 60s, while Donggala's population growth stagnated around the 1960s. In 1951, [[Poso Regency]] was founded with its capital in [[Poso]] and Palu Regency with its capital in Palu. This was met with opposition and conflict between residents of Palu and Donggala, as the Donggala residents believed it would further limit the town's development.<ref name=":3" /> To avoid conflict, on 14 September 1951, a motion was sent to Sulawesi governor to rename Palu Regency to Donggala Regency while keeping the capital in Palu as a compromise.<ref name=":3" /> Palu continued to outgrow Donggala, and the creation of Palu Administrative City and subsequent creation of Central Sulawesi province in 1964 with Palu as its capital further distanced Donggala from its past status.<ref name=":3" /> The province was established on 12 April 1964 due to demand from student groups for its creation to represent the region.<ref name=":3" /> The city gained administrative status in 1978 and ''[[kotamadya]]'' in 1994.<ref name=":02">Pemerintah Kota Palu.

== Geography ==
The city of Palu is located in the Palu basin, close to Palu Bay, and lies directly on the [[Palu-Koro Fault]]. The basin is mostly composed of [[alluvial deposit]]s of clay, silt, and sand, which were deposited by the flow of the [[Palu River]] from land above the valley. Alluvial sediments around the city are not consolidated and relatively young. The basement rock has been dated to the [[Cretaceous|Cretaceous period]]. Below the layers of deposits, the rock in the region is mostly tertiary [[granite]] and [[granodiorite]]. The sediments are between {{Convert|25|and|125|meters|abbr=out}} depending on the location; sediments in the northern part of the city are thicker than those in the south because they are closer to the river's estuary.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web |title=Investigasi_Awal_LongsorLikuifaksi_Geotechnical_Extreme_Events_Reconnaissance_Akibat_Gempa_Palu |url=https://simantu.pu.go.id/personal/img-post/adminkms/post/20210309142833__F__Investigasi_Awal_LongsorLikuifaksi_Geotechnical_Extreme_Events_Reconnaissance_Akibat_Gempa_Palu_28_September_2018_Pusgen_2019.pdf}}</ref> 

The Palu–Koro Fault runs for around {{Convert|300|km|miles|abbr=on}} through Palu Bay, cutting into the middle of the city, and is connected to a [[subduction zone]] in northern Sulawesi. The abundance of relatively weak sediments below the city was among the causes of massive [[soil liquefaction]] and landslides that occurred during the [[2018 Sulawesi earthquake]]; the soil below the city was not consolidated enough.<ref name=":4" /><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Jalil |first1=Abdul |last2=Fathani |first2=Teuku Faisal |last3=Satyarno |first3=Iman |last4=Wilopo |first4=Wahyu |date=2021-08-24 |title=Liquefaction in Palu: the cause of massive mudflows |journal=Geoenvironmental Disasters |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=21 |doi=10.1186/s40677-021-00194-y |s2cid=237272220 |issn=2197-8670|doi-access=free |bibcode=2021GeoDi...8...21J }}</ref>

Palu has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Af''), although it is relatively dry due to the strong [[rain shadow]] of the surrounding mountains.<ref name="CD"/>

=== Administrative division ===
At the time of the [[2010 Indonesian census]], Palu was divided into four [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''kecamatan''); in 2011 these were re-organized into a new division of eight districts. These are tabulated below with their areas and their population at the 2010 census<ref>Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and the 2020 census,<ref>Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> together with the official estimates as of mid 2023.<ref>Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2024.</ref> The table also includes the number of [[administrative village|urban villages]] (''kelurahan'') in each district.

The relationship between the Kaili and Minahasan populations was tense during its early days partly due to religious differences between the mostly-Muslim Kaili and the mostly-Christian Minahasan; and because the Minahasan, who were usually government workers during the colonial era and the early days of Indonesian republic, were generally considered financially more capable.<ref name=":3" /> There was also brief tension between Bugis and Kaili people due to perceived economic differences, resulting in riots at traditional market in 1992 and 2004.<ref>{{Cite thesis |title=MODEL PENGELOLAAN KONFLIK DI PASAR INPRES MANONDA PALU KECAMATAN PALU BARAT SULAWESI TENGAH |url=http://repository.unhas.ac.id/id/eprint/9808/ |publisher=Universitas Hasanuddin |date=2013-07-05 |degree=masters |language=id |first=SITI HAJAR N. |last=AEPU}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Lampe |first1=Ilyas |last2=Anriani |first2=Haslinda B. |date=2016-06-04 |title=Stereotipe, Prasangka dan Dinamika Antaretnik |url=http://jurnal-p2kp.id/index.php/jp2kp/article/view/42 |journal=Jurnal Penelitian Pers Dan Komunikasi Pembangunan |language=id |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=19–32 |doi=10.46426/jp2kp.v20i1.42 |doi-broken-date=1 November 2024 |issn=2527-693X|doi-access=free }}</ref>
