==Geography==
The region is named after the [[Dakhlet Nouadhibou]] Bay and contains Mauritania's part of the [[Ras Nouadhibou|Cabo Blanco]] [[peninsula]].<ref name="mapcarta">{{cite web|url=http://mapcarta.com/17541912|title=Dakhlet Nouadhibou|work=Mapcarta|accessdate=18 October 2016}}</ref> It is the westernmost [[Regions of Mauritania|region]] of the country. It borders [[Western Sahara]] to the north, the Mauritanian region of [[Inchiri Region|Inchiri]] to the east and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west. The [[Bay of Arguin]] dominates the west of the region, the [[Banc d'Arguin National Park]] dominates the south and includes much of the bay's islands, the southernmost of the bay and the southeasternmost parts of the park are not in the region, about a third of the region is a national park area. Nearly all of the country's islands and islets lies in this region and they include [[Echakcher]], [[Kiaone|Kiaones]], [[Niroumi]], [[Nair (Mauritania)|Nair]], [[Arel (Mauritania)|Arel]], [[Tidra]], the country's largest island, [[Kijji]], [[Touffat]], [[Cheddid]] and sometimes [[Serenni]]. 

Mauritania is mostly covered with desert, with only its western regions around the coast of [[Atlantic Ocean]] having some vegetation, along with the southern regions on the Senegal river. There are some oasis in the desert regions. Since it is a desert, there are large shifting dunes forming temporary ranges. The average elevation is around {{convert|460|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the mean sea level. The rainfall in the northern regions closer to the [[Tropic of Cancer]] receives around {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} of annual rainfall compared to the southern portions that receives around {{convert|660|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The average temperature is {{convert|37.8|C|F|abbr=on}}, while during the night it reaches {{convert|0|C|F|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Geography, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DJgnebGbAB8C&dq=mauritania+geography&pg=PA591|page=591|first=R. W. |last=McColl|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2014|isbn=9780816072293}}</ref>  

Due to the geography, the inhabitants historically, have been nomadic. In modern times, people have migrated to urban centres during the drought in the 1970s and the early 1980s. There are a few sedentary cultivators, who are located only in the Southern regions of the country. Research has indicated that the Saharan movement has resulted in reduction of rains in the region from the 1960s, when it received close to {{convert|250|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rainfall.<ref>{{cite book|title=Africa South of the Sahara 2004|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jj4J-AXGDaQC&dq=mauritania+geography&pg=PA699|page=699|chapter=Mauritania - Physical and Social Geography|last=Hilling|first=David|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2004|isbn=9781857431834}}</ref> 

==Local administration==
[[File:Dakhlet Nouadhibou Department.png|thumb|left|250px|Dakhlet Nouadhibou Region]]
The local administration is adopted from French local administration framework with the Ministry of Internal Control governing the local bodies. The original administration was held by Governors of each district, but after the municipal elections in 1994, the powers have been decentralized from the district bodies.<ref>{{cite book|title=Mauritania Foreign Policy and Government Guide, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r7cP8wivcEkC&dq=mauritania+local+administration&pg=PA31|page=31|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|isbn=9781433032790|date=2007-02-07}}</ref>

Nouadhibou is one of 15 ''wilayas'' (regions). The smallest administrative division in the region is the commune. A group of communes form a ''moughataa'' (department) and a group of ''moughataa'' form a district. The executive power of the district is vested on a district chief, while it is on the ''hakem'' in the ''moughataa''.<ref>{{cite report|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/un/unpan023277.pdf|page=7|title=Islamic Republic of Mauritania profile Public Administration and Country profile|accessdate=17 November 2016|publisher=Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), United Nations|year=2004|archive-date=19 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119183222/http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/un/unpan023277.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>  

The communes are responsible for overseeing and coordinating development activities and are financed by the state. The Local Governments have their own legal jurisdiction, financial autonomy, an annual budget, staff, and an office. The elections for the local government are conducted every five years along with Regional and Parliamentary elections. On account of the political instability, the last elections were held in 2023.   

Settlements outside the regional capital includes [[Arguin|Agadir or Arguin]], [[Arkeiss]], [[R'Geiba]], [[Chami, Mauritania|Chami]], [[Iouik]] (or Iwik), [[Tanoudert]], [[Teichott]], [[Ten-Alloul]] and [[Tessot]].<ref>{{cite report|title=Project approval on a proposed IDA grant|date=23 May 2013|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/943421468056371471/pdf/760530PAD0P127010Box377322B00OUO090.pdf?bcsi_scan_f5761508bdf24bd5=Jc5QwgSIAV5SX9WgMyUK6TxJom0zAAAAvgRKww==&bcsi_scan_filename=760530PAD0P127010Box377322B00OUO090.pdf|publisher=Urban Development & Services Practice, Country Department AFCF1, Africa Region, World Bank|pages=2–3|accessdate=17 November 2016}}</ref>
