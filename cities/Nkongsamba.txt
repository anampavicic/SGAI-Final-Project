'''Nkongsamba''' is a city in western [[Cameroon]]. It is in the [[Moungo (department)|Moungo]]<ref>{{Cite web |last=CELESTECOM |first=Cabinet |title=Geographical Location |url=https://www.nkongsamba.net/physical-geographical-location-and-characteristics.html |access-date=2023-05-24 |website=Nkongsamba City website |language=en}}</ref> [[Departments of Cameroon|department]], which is in the [[Littoral Region (Cameroon)|Littoral]]. As of the 2005 Census, the city had a population of 104,050.  It is a centre for the farming of [[palm oil]], [[banana]]s and [[coffee]], and is between two mountains, the Manengouba Massif ({{convert|2,396|m}}) and Mount Nlonako. The central point is the "Ville"; other areas are measured in "Kilo", for kilometer. [[Mbo language (Cameroon)|Mbo]] (Manenguba) is one of the languages used locally: in the surrounding district, [[Kaa language|Kaa]] and [[Baneka language|Baneka]] are used.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Bryan |editor-first=Margaret Arminel |title=The Bantu Languages of Africa |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1959 |page=4}}</ref>

[[Baré, Cameroon|Baré]] is a village about {{convert|10|km}} from Ville. There is a weekly Thursday market at which farmers from the surrounding area gather to sell their goods.

== Transport ==
Nkongsamba was the terminus of the {{convert|172|km|adj=on}} western railway line from the port of [[Douala]].  Completed by German colonists in 1911, the railway line played a critical economic role in facilitating the shipment of agricultural commodities, especially coffee, to Douala.  Nkongsamba slid into economic decline with the closure of the last {{convert|50|km|adj=on}} segment of the line from [[Mbanga, Cameroon|Mbanga]].  The town's charming [[art deco]] railway station remains but has been converted to housing. The city also has an abandoned [[airstrip]].
