'''Benxi''' ({{zh|s=本溪}}, {{respell|pun|shee}}) is a [[prefecture-level city]] located in the east of [[Liaoning]] province, People's Republic of China, south-southeast of the provincial capital [[Shenyang]]. As of the 2020 census, its population was 1,326,018 (1,709,538 in 2010) whom 809,655 lived in the built-up area made of 3 urban districts (Pingshan, Xihu and Mingshan). It was founded as a metallurgical center in 1915. Benxi Iron and Steel Company (Bengang) is the largest employer in the city, and used to be the fourth-largest steel company in China. The second-largest industry in Benxi is coal mining. The city has [[pollution]] problems due to steel production and coal mining.

During the disaster of Air France flight [[AF 447|AF447]], Benxi Iron and Steel Company lost 5 employees, including the executive Chen Chiping who was the wife of Liaoning's provincial governor.<ref name=ASN>{{cite web |url=http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/vooaf447/interna/0,,OI3799058-EI13960,00-Pelo+menos+nomes+do+voo+AF+sao+conhecidos.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606111517/http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/vooaf447/interna/0%2C%2COI3799058-EI13960%2C00-Pelo%2Bmenos%2Bnomes%2Bdo%2Bvoo%2BAF%2Bsao%2Bconhecidos.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 June 2009 |title=AF447 victim |publisher=www.terra.com.br |access-date=4 June 2009 }}</ref>

==History==
As early as 400,000 years ago, there were people living in Benxi prefecture, which was indicated by Miaohou Mountain ruins with human fossils and stone tools explored in this region.

The worst coal mining disaster in the world took place on April 26, 1942 in [[Benxihu Colliery]]. A coal-dust explosion killed 1,549 miners working that day, making it the worst disaster in the history of [[coal mining]] and the second worst recorded industrial accident. The explosion sent flames bursting out of the mine shaft entrance. Miners' relatives rushed to the site but were denied entry by a cordon of Japanese guards who erected electric fences to keep them out.<ref name="britannica.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Honkeiko-colliery-mining-disaster|title=Honkeiko colliery mining disaster &#124; explosion, Benxi, Liaoning, China [1942]|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> In an attempt to curtail the fire underground, the Japanese shut off the ventilation and sealed the pit head. Witnesses say that the Japanese did not evacuate the pit fully before sealing it, trapping many Chinese workers underground to suffocate in the smoke.<ref name="chinazhaoge">{{cite web|title=Chinazhaoge Blog|url=http://chinazhaoge.blog.sohu.com/21038332.html|publisher=sohu.com|access-date=7 August 2010|language=zh}}</ref>

The city is home to a notable number of [[Manchu]] and [[Hui]] people.

==Administrative divisions==

Benxi is rich with tourist attractions. The eastern side of the prefecture is covered with mountains, caves and lakes with low population, making the various parks in that area popular.

The Benxi Lake, located at the urban area of Xihu district in Benxi, after which the city was named in Qing dynasty, is the tiniest lake in the world.{{cn|date=April 2024}} With an area less than 15 sq. meters and a daily rate of flow at approximately 20,000 tons, the lake acts as a famous tourist attraction of the city.

The [[Benxi Shuidong National Park|Benxi Water Cave National Park]] is a subterranean river, some 3,000 meters long, 2 meters deep and wide enough for 20-30 boats. It flows through this cave situated {{convert|35|km|abbr=on}} east of Benxi city. The cave is filled with countless [[stalactite]]s and stone flowers, pillars and curtains.

[[Wunü Mountain|Wunü Mountain National Park]] is an area of natural beauty.
