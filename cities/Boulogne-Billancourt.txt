'''Boulogne-Billancourt''' ({{IPA|fr|bulɔɲ bijɑ̃kuʁ|-|LL-Q150 (fra)-Jules78120-Boulogne-Billancourt.wav}}; often colloquially called simply '''Boulogne''', until 1924 '''Boulogne-sur-Seine''', {{IPA|fr|bulɔɲ syʁ sɛn|}}) is a wealthy and prestigious [[Communes of France|commune]] in the western suburbs of [[Paris]], [[France]], located {{convert|8.2|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the [[Kilometre zero|centre of Paris]]. It is a [[Subprefectures in France|subprefecture]] of the [[Hauts-de-Seine]] [[Departments of France|department]] and thus the seat of the larger [[arrondissement of Boulogne-Billancourt]]. It is also part of the [[Métropole du Grand Paris]]. Boulogne-Billancourt includes one island in the [[Seine]]: [[Île Seguin]]. 

Boulogne-Billancourt is one of the wealthiest regions in the Parisian area and in France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journaldunet.com/business/salaire/boulogne-billancourt/ville-92012 |title=Salaire à Boulogne-Billancourt (92100, Hauts-de-Seine) |language=fr |publisher=JDN |access-date=20 June 2016}}</ref> Formerly an important industrial site, it has successfully reconverted into business services and is now home to major communication companies headquartered in the [[Val de Seine]] [[Central business district|business district]].

==Etymology==
The original name of the commune was Boulogne-sur-Seine (meaning "Boulogne upon [[Seine]]").

Before the 14th century, Boulogne was a small village called ''Menuls-lès-Saint-Cloud'' (meaning "Menuls near [[Saint-Cloud]]"). In the beginning of the 14th century, King [[Philip IV of France]] ordered the building in ''Menuls-lès-Saint-Cloud'' of a church dedicated to the virgin of the sanctuary of [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], then a famous pilgrimage center in northern France. The church, meant to become a pilgrimage centre closer to Paris than the distant city of Boulogne-sur-Mer, was named Notre-Dame de Boulogne la Petite ("Our Lady of Boulogne the Minor"). Gradually, the village of ''Menuls-lès-Saint-Cloud'' became known as ''Boulogne-la-Petite'', and later as ''Boulogne-sur-Seine''.

In 1924, ''Boulogne-sur-Seine'' was officially renamed Boulogne-Billancourt to reflect the development of the industrial neighbourhood of Billancourt annexed in 1860.

As for the name Billancourt, it was recorded for the first time in 1150 as ''Bullencort'', sometimes also spelled ''Bollencort''. It comes from [[Medieval Latin]] ''cortem'', [[Accusative case|accusative]] of ''cors'', meaning "enclosure", "estate", suffixed to the Germanic [[patronym]] Buolo (meaning "friend, brother, kinsman"), thus having the meaning of "estate of Buolo".

==History==
[[File:Église Notre Dame Boulogne Billancourt 1.jpg|thumb|left|Church of Our Lady of Boulogne]]
On 1 January 1860, the City of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighbouring communes. On that occasion, the communes of [[Auteuil, Paris|Auteuil]] and [[Passy]] were disbanded and divided between Boulogne-Billancourt (then called ''Boulogne-sur-Seine'') and the city of Paris. ''Boulogne-sur-Seine'' received a small part of the territory of Passy, and about half of the territory of Auteuil (including the area of Billancourt, which belonged to the disbanded commune of Auteuil).

Some of the competitive [[Shooting at the 1900 Summer Olympics|shooting]] events of the [[1900 Summer Olympics]] took place in Boulogne-Billancourt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1900/1900.pdf |title=1900 Summer Olympics official report |page= 16 |access-date= 14 November 2010 |language=fr |publisher=La84foundation.org}}</ref>

In 1929, the [[Bois de Boulogne]], which was hitherto divided between the communes of Boulogne-Billancourt and [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], was annexed in its entirety by the city of Paris. On that occasion, Boulogne-Billancourt, to which most of the Bois de Boulogne belonged, lost about half of its territory.  Since then, Boulogne-Billancourt has been surrounded to the west, south and east by the [[Seine]] and to the north and north-east by the [[16th arrondissement of Paris]].

Boulogne-Billancourt is known for being the birthplace of three major French industries. It was the location, in 1906 for the very first [[aircraft]] factory, that of [[Voisin (aircraft)|Appareils d'Aviation Les Frères Voisin]],<ref name=Davilla>{{cite book|last1=Davilla|first1=James J.|last2=Soltan|first2=Arthur |title=French Aircraft of the First World War|publisher=Flying Machines Press|location=Mountain View, CA|year=1997|isbn=978-1891268090|page=541}}</ref> which was then followed by those of many other aviation pioneers, and the tradition continues with several aviation related companies still operating in the area.

The [[automobile]] industry had a large presence with [[Renault]] on [[Île Seguin]], as well as [[Salmson]] building both cars and aircraft engines. Finally, the French film industry started here and, from 1922 to 1992 it was the home of the [[Billancourt Studios]], and since becoming a major location for French [[film production]]. It was used as the setting of the TV show ''[[Code Lyoko]]''.

* The ecologic neighbourhood of the ''Trapèze'' in Boulogne-Billancourt: the district stands on 74 hectares and will be able to house up to 18,000 inhabitants at the end of its construction. 65% of the district's energy is brought by geothermal power, which heats and freshens the buildings. Solar panels and a vegetable greenhouse were installed in the aim to link the district to sustainable energies. Bicycle and "soft" travels will of course be put first to reduce the pollution caused by cars, as well as other vehicles which do not run on electricity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2013/09/13/01016-20130913ARTFIG00538-boulogne-le-plus-grand-ecoquartier-de-france.php|title="Boulogne, le plus grand écoquartier de France"|last=Samuel|first=Mikaëla|date=13 September 2013|work=Le Figaro|access-date=12 May 2017|language=fr-FR|issn=0182-5852}}</ref>
