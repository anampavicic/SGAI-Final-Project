'''San Pablo''', officially the '''City of San Pablo''' ({{lang-fil|Lungsod ng San Pablo}}), is a 1st class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 285,348 people.{{PH census|current}}

It is located in the southern portion of [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]], it is one of the oldest cities in the Philippines. By land area, it is the largest in the province of Laguna. Its population ranks sixth within the province after the cities of [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]], [[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Santa Rosa]], [[Biñan]], [[San Pedro, Laguna|San Pedro]], and [[Cabuyao]].

The city is also known as the "City of Seven Lakes" ({{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Pitong Lawa}}), referring to the [[Seven Lakes of San Pablo]]: [[Lake Sampaloc]] (or Sampalok), [[Lake Palakpakin]], [[Lake Bunot]], [[Lakes Pandin and Yambo]], [[Lake Muhikap]], and [[Lake Calibato]].

San Pablo was part of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lipa]] beginning in 1910. On November 28, 1967, it became an independent [[diocese]] and became the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Pablo]].

==Etymology==
San Pablo is derived from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for Saint Paul, referring to the local patron saint, [[Paul of Thebes|Paul the First Hermit]]. It was previously known as ''San Pablo de los Montes'', which translates to "Saint Paul of the Mountains" in Spanish.<ref name=history>{{cite news|url=https://www.sanpablocity.gov.ph/history|title=History|website=San Pablo City|accessdate=August 23, 2024}}</ref>

==History==
San Pablo's earliest historical record dates back to pre-[[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] times when four large barrios bounded by [[Mount Makiling]] composed "Sampalok" (Sampaloc).
tr
In 1571, the first Spanish troops under Captain [[Juan de Salcedo]] arrived in the upland village of Sampaloc. It was noted by Father Joaquin Martinez de Zuñiga that its original inhabitants were [[Aeta people|Aetas]] and were ruled by four chieftains.

San Pablo became a parish in 1586, and then a municipality in 1647, and was renamed "San Pablo de los Montes" in honor of [[Paul of Thebes|Saint Paul the First Hermit]].

Augustinian friar, Father Hernando Cabrera built the first church made of wood. It was noted that the sacristy of this church was ornamented and contained silver, which rivalled and even surpassed that of Spain.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Conservation and guidelines for the san pablo heritage zone |url=https://sanpablocityheritagezone.ph/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3.0-Historical-Development_compressed.pdf}}</ref>

In 1756, it was placed under the jurisdiction of [[Batangas]] province but was returned to Laguna in 1883.

[[File:Philippine Island - Luzon Island - NARA - 68157059.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of San Pablo, 1941]]
In 1899, a municipal government was established, with Atty. Innocente Martinez as municipal president. Marcos Paulino was elected municipal president in 1902 when the civil government was set up. From 1926 to 1940, the people of San Pablo worked for its independence from the province of [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]].

On May 7, 1940, the Charter Bill sponsored by Assemblyman Tomas D. Dizon of [[Laguna's 1st congressional district|Laguna's 1st district]] was approved by President [[Manuel L. Quezon]]. The bill became known as the City Charter of San Pablo or Commonwealth Act No. 520, approved by President Quezon.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=CA|number=520|title=An Act Creating the City of San Pablo|date=May 7, 1940|access-date=December 12, 2022|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Commonwealth%20Act%20520}}</ref>

The city was inaugurated on March 30, 1941, with Potenciano Malvar, a former [[governor of Laguna]], as the city mayor appointed by president Manuel L. Quezon. Succeeding him in 1941 as an appointed mayor was Manuel Quisumbing, in turn followed by Tomas D. Dizon in 1943 as an appointed mayor. The succeeding mayors were elected after 1955, with Cipriano B. Colago being the first elected city mayor.<ref name=history />

==Geography==
San Pablo has a cool climate owing to its location. It is nestled in the foothills of three mountains: [[Mount Banahaw]], [[Mount Makiling]] and the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre Mountains]] within the [[Laguna Volcanic Field]], also known as the San Pablo Volcanic Field- an area of over 200 geologic features, among which are the 7 crater lakes of which the city is famed for. 

These geologic features not only provide attractions for the tourism industry (such as waterfalls) and sources of many forest-based products, but also serve as stewards for the clean air. 

It is situated {{convert|82|km|sp=us}} southeast of [[Manila]] via [[Alaminos, Laguna|Alaminos]], {{convert|37|km|sp=us}} southwest of [[Santa Cruz, Laguna|Santa Cruz]] via [[Calauan, Laguna|Calauan]].

Its soil is suitable for those seeking opportunities in agriculture and horticulture given its richness and fertility. The different barangays have [[coconut]] plantation, lanzones fruit – ''[[Lansium parasiticum]]'' [[tree plantation]] and rambutan fruit tree plantation – [[Rambutan]]. The place is rich in [[orchid]] plants.

At the end of the 20th century and the start of the 21st century, economic development shifted from San Pablo to western Laguna. [[San Pedro, Laguna|San Pedro]], [[Biñan]], [[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Santa Rosa]], [[Cabuyao]], [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]], [[Los Baños, Laguna|Los Baños]], and [[Santa Cruz, Laguna|Santa Cruz]] experienced rapid economic development brought about by local and foreign investments, the rapid growth of industrial estates and export processing zones, and the placement of major institutions in those areas, San Pablo City was left behind and remained a semi-developed residential community.

Despite the fact that the city was partly touched by economic development, San Pablo boasts itself as a potential eco-tourism destination in the province. However, given its human and land resources, various BPO companies are seriously looking at developing the city into the ICT hub of Southern Luzon. Although there were previous attempts to build a similar establishment, [[SM Prime Holdings]] was given its go signal in July 2008 to push ahead for [[SM City San Pablo]] located at Riverina Commercial Estates along Maharlika Highway at Barangay San Rafael.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.smprime.com/sm-city-san-pablo |title=SM City San Pablo &#124; SM Prime Holdings |access-date=June 25, 2016 |archive-date=August 10, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810205511/http://www.smprime.com/sm-city-san-pablo |url-status=dead }}</ref>
Apart from this, the development of the Hacienda Escudero plantation resort town and nearby real estates, which is a joint venture with Landco, is by far the largest planned community investment in the city covering {{convert|415|ha}}: It will include resort type communities; the original [[Villa Escudero Plantations]] as the center-piece; commercial establishments like a mall, hotels, and a convention center to be built relative to the distinctive architecture theme of the original Villa Escudero. As such ''Hacienda Escudero'' will become the ultimate history town themed community in this part of the country.

[[ABS-CBN]] TV-46 San Pablo (DWLY-TV) served the city through its office along Rizal Avenue at the heart of the city until its operations was [[ABS-CBN franchise renewal controversy|shut down]] in 2020.

San Pablo also claims the title "City of [[Coconut pie|Buko Pie]]", although other neighboring towns are also known for producing the delicacy. Colettes' Buko Pie, based in San Pablo, was known for experimenting with different variants of the delicacy. Colette's has also regularly produced the "World's Largest Buko Pie" during San Pablo's Coco Festival. Colette's is the largest Buko Pie brand in the Laguna area with 34 stores. The supply of coconut in San Pablo makes it an ideal spot for putting up buko pie shops.

[[Franklin Baker Company]], one of the well-known companies with operations in San Pablo, has announced that its plant in the city would cease its operations and transfer to another existing facility, owned by the said company, in [[Davao del Sur]] by December 2008. The said decision could affect the jobs of at least 1,200 people, the majority of them San Pableños. Various factors are blamed for this closure, including the conversion of big coconut farms into residential areas.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view_article.php?article_id=111583|date=January 10, 2008|access-date=May 8, 2008|title=83-year-old factory to close, render 1,200 workers jobless}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> However, production was restored in the first quarter of 2009 in the San Pablo plant of Franklin Baker Company due to processing problems encountered at [[Davao del Sur]].{{clear left}}
