During the [[West Slavs|early Slavic]] period a fishing settlement called ''Bydgoszcza'' ("Bydgostia" in Latin) became a stronghold on the Vistula [[trade route]]s.

The [[gród]] of Bydgoszcz was built between 1037 and 1053 during the reign of [[Casimir I the Restorer]]. In the 13th century it was the site of a [[castellany]], mentioned in 1238, probably founded in the early 12th century during the reign of [[Bolesław III Wrymouth]]. In the 13th century, the church of [[Saint Giles]] was built as the first church of Bydgoszcz. The Germans later demolished it in the late 19th century.<ref name=TB/>{{Better source needed|date=June 2024}} The first bridge was constructed at the reign of [[Casimir I of Kuyavia]].

The [[Treaty of Bromberg]], agreed in 1657 by King [[John II Casimir Vasa]] of [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]] and Elector [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Frederick William II]] of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], created a military alliance between Poland and Prussia while marking the withdrawal of Prussia from its alliance with Sweden.

After the [[Convocation Sejm (1764)|Convocation Sejm of 1764]], Bydgoszcz became one of three seats of the [[Crown Tribunal]] for the [[Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown]] alongside [[Poznań]] and [[Piotrków Trybunalski]].<ref name=TB/>{{Better source needed|date=June 2024}} In 1766 royal cartographer [[Franciszek Florian Czaki]], during a meeting of the Committee of the Crown Treasury in [[Warsaw]], proposed a plan of building a canal, which would connect the Vistula via the Brda with the [[Noteć]] river.

In 1807, after the defeat of Prussia by [[Napoleon]] and the signing of the [[Treaty of Tilsit]], Bydgoszcz became part of the short-lived Polish [[Duchy of Warsaw]], within which it was the seat of the [[Bydgoszcz Department]]. With Napoleon's defeat at the [[Battle of Nations]] in 1813, the town was re-annexed by Prussia as part of the [[Grand Duchy of Posen]] (Poznań), becoming the capital of the [[Bromberg (region)|Bromberg Region]]. During the [[November Uprising]], a [[Resistance movements in partitioned Poland (1795–1918)|Polish insurgent organization]] was active in the city and local Poles helped smuggle volunteers, weapons and ammunition to the [[Russian Partition]] of Poland.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Umiński|first=Janusz|year=1998|title=Losy internowanych na Pomorzu żołnierzy powstania listopadowego|magazine=Jantarowe Szlaki|volume=4 |language=pl|issue=250|page=13}}</ref> After the fall of the uprising, one of the main escape routes for surviving insurgents and civilian insurgent authorities from partitioned Poland to the [[Great Emigration]] led through the city.<ref>Umiński, p. 16</ref>

In 1871 the Province of Posen, along with the rest of the Kingdom of Prussia, became part of the newly formed [[German Empire]]. During German rule, the oldest church of the city (church of Saint Giles), the remains of the castle,<ref name=TB/><ref name=VB/> and the Carmelite church and monastery were demolished. In the mid-19th century, the city saw the arrival of the [[Prussian Eastern Railway]]. The first stretch, from Schneidemühl ([[Piła]]), was opened in July 1851.

At the time of [[World War I]], Poles in Bydgoszcz formed secret organizations, preparing to regain control of the city in the event of Poland regaining its independence.<ref name=TYG>{{cite web|url=http://tygodnikbydgoski.pl/historia/bydgoszcz-w-rece-polskie-przeszla-pokojowo-14-07-19|title=Bydgoszcz w ręce polskie przeszła pokojowo|website=Tygodnik Bydgoski|access-date=27 October 2019|author=Stefan Pastuszewski|language=pl}}</ref>

After the war, Bydgoszcz was assigned to the [[Second Polish Republic|recreated Polish state]] by the 1919 [[Versailles Treaty]]. Now officially Bydgoszcz again, the city belonged to the [[Poznań Voivodeship (1921–1939)|Poznań Voivodeship]]. The local populace was required to acquire Polish citizenship or leave the country. This led to a drastic decline in ethnically [[German minority in Poland|German residents]], whose number within the town decreased from over 40.000 in 1910 to 11,016 in 1926.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KVg_tMs_ZPIC&q=adelnau&pg=PA365|title=Polens Politik gegenüber seiner deutschen Minderheit 1919–1939|first1=Albert S.|last1=Kotowski|page=56|publisher=Forschungsstelle Ostmitteleuropa, [[University of Dortmund]] |year=1998 |language=de|isbn=3-447-03997-3}}</ref> A Nazi German youth organization was subsequently founded, which distributed [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|Nazi propaganda]] books from Germany among the German minority.{{sfn|Wardzyńska|2009|p=23}}

The city's boundaries were greatly expanded in 1920 to include the surrounding suburbs of Okole, Szwederowo, Bartodzieje, Kapuściska, Wilczak, Jachcice and more, which made Bydgoszcz the third biggest in terms of size area city of the [[Second Polish Republic]].<ref>Infrastruktura i gospodarka komunalna.

{{Main|German retribution against people of Bydgoszcz}}
[[File:Public execution of Polish hostages in Bydgoszcz 1939.jpg|thumb|left|Public execution of Polish civilians caught by the Germans in a street roundup on 9 September 1939.]]
During the [[invasion of Poland]], at the beginning of [[World War II]], on September 1, 1939, Germany carried out air raids on the city. The Polish [[15th Infantry Division (Poland)|15th Infantry Division]], which was stationed in Bydgoszcz, fought off German attacks on September 2, but on September 3 was forced to retreat. During the withdrawal of Poles, as part of the diversion planned by Germany, local Germans opened fire on Polish soldiers and civilians. Polish soldiers and civilians were forced into a defensive battle in which several hundred people were killed on both sides. The event, referred to as the ''[[Bloody Sunday (1939)|Bloody Sunday]]'' by the [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|propaganda of Nazi Germany]], which exaggerated the number of victims to 5,000 "defenceless" Germans, was used as an excuse to carry out dozens of mass executions of Polish residents in the Old Market Square and in the [[Valley of Death (Bydgoszcz)|Valley of Death]].<ref name=TB/><ref name=VB/> Between September 3–10, 1939, the Germans executed 192 Poles in the city.{{sfn|Wardzyńska|2009|p=110}}

On September 5, while the [[Wehrmacht]] entered the city, German-Polish skirmishes still took place in the Szwederowo district, and the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|German occupation]] of the city began. The German ''[[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe IV]]'', ''[[Einsatzkommando|Einsatzkommando 16]]'' and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-Totenkopf-Standarte "Brandenburg" entered the city to commit [[Nazi crimes against the Polish nation|atrocities against the Polish population]], and afterwards some of its members co-formed the local German police.{{sfn|Wardzyńska|2009|pp=55, 61–62}} Many of the murders were carried out as part of the ''[[Intelligenzaktion]]'', aimed at exterminating the Polish elites and preventing the establishment of a [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance movement]],{{sfn|Wardzyńska|2009|p=71}} which emerged regardless. On September 24, the local German ''[[Kreisleiter]]'' called local Polish city officials to a supposed formal meeting in the city hall, from where they were taken to a nearby forest and exterminated.{{sfn|Wardzyńska|2009|p=102}} The ''Kreisleiter'' also ordered the execution of their family members to "avoid creating martyrs".{{sfn|Wardzyńska|2009|p=102}} By decision from September 5, 1939, one of the first three German special courts in occupied Poland was established in Bydgoszcz.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Grabowski|first=Waldemar|year=2009|title=Polacy na ziemiach II RP włączonych do III Rzeszy|magazine=Biuletyn Instytutu Pamięci Narodowej|language=pl|publisher=IPN|issue=8–9 (103–104)|page=62|issn=1641-9561}}</ref>

The Germans established several camps and prisons for Poles.{{sfn|Wardzyńska|2009|p=110}} As of September 30, 1939, over 3,000 individuals were imprisoned there, and in October and November, the Germans carried out further mass arrests of over 7,200 people.{{sfn|Wardzyńska|2009|pp=157–158}} Many of those people were then murdered.{{sfn|Wardzyńska|2009|p=158}} Poles from Bydgoszcz were massacred at various locations in the city, at the Valley of Death and in the nearby village of [[Tryszczyn]].{{sfn|Wardzyńska|2009|p=158}} The victims were both men and women, including activists, school principals, teachers, priests, local officials, merchants, lawyers, and also boy and girl scouts, gymnasium students and children as young as 12.{{sfn|Wardzyńska|2009|pp=158–160}} The executions were presented as punishment for supposedly "murdering Germans" and "destroying peace", and were used by Nazi propaganda to show the world that it was alleged "Polish terror" that forced [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] to start the war.{{sfn|Wardzyńska|2009|p=158}} On the [[National Independence Day (Poland)|Polish National Independence Day]], November 11, 1939, the Germans symbolically publicly executed Leon Barciszewski, the mayor of Bydgoszcz.{{sfn|Wardzyńska|2009|p=160}} On November 17, 1939, the commander of the local [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]]-[[Einsatzkommando|EK]] unit declared there was no more Polish [[intelligentsia]] capable of resistance in the city.{{sfn|Wardzyńska|2009|p=160}}

The city was annexed to the newly formed province of [[Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia]] as the [[seat (legal entity)|seat]] of the district or county (''kreis'') of Bromberg. However, the annexation was not recognised in international law.

The Polish resistance was active in Bydgoszcz. Activities included distribution of underground Polish press, sabotage actions, stealing German ammunition to aid Polish partisans, espionage of German activity{{sfn|Chrzanowski|2022|pp=30, 40–41, 47–48, 57, 62}} and providing shelter for British POWs who escaped from the Stalag XX-A POW camp.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chrzanowski|first=Bogdan|title=Organizacja sieci przerzutów drogą morską z Polski do Szwecji w latach okupacji hitlerowskiej (1939–1945)|journal=Stutthof.

In the same year 1945, the city was made the seat of the [[Pomeranian Voivodship]], the northern part of which was soon separated to form [[Gdańsk Voivodeship (1945–1975)|Gdańsk Voivodship]]. The remaining part of the Pomeranian Voivodship was renamed [[Bydgoszcz Voivodeship]] in 1950. In 1951 and 1969, [[Bydgoszcz University of Science and Technology]] and [[Kazimierz Wielki University in Bydgoszcz]] were founded respectively.

In 1973, the former town of [[Fordon (Bydgoszcz district)|Fordon]], located on the left bank of the Vistula, was included in the city limits<ref name="EP"/> and became the easternmost district of Bydgoszcz. In March 1981, [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]'s activists [[Bydgoszcz events|were violently suppressed in Bydgoszcz]].

With the [[Polish local government reforms]] of 1999, Bydgoszcz became the seat of the governor of a province entitled [[Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship]]. In 2005, [[Kazimierz Wielki University in Bydgoszcz|Casimir the Great University]] was opened in Bydgoszcz.

Currently, Bydgoszcz is the biggest center of [[NATO]] headquarters in Poland, the most known being the [[Joint Force Training Centre]]. In May 2023, debris of a Russian [[Kh-55]] [[Air-to-surface missile|air-sol missile]] was found in the forest of the near village [[Zamość, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Zamość]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=2023-05-10 |title=Military object found in Polish forest was Russian missile - media |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/military-object-found-polish-forest-was-russian-missile-media-2023-05-10/ |access-date=2023-05-31}}</ref>

== Main sights ==
The oldest building in the city is the [[Bydgoszcz Cathedral|Cathedral of St Martin and St Nicolas]], commonly known as Fara Church. It is a three-aisle late Gothic church, erected between 1466 and 1502, which boasts a late-Gothic painting entitled ''Madonna with a Rose'' or ''the Holy Virgin of Beautiful Love'' from the 16th century. The colourful 20th-century polychrome is also especially worthy of note.

[[File:Bdg wiezacisnien 2 07-2013.jpg|thumb|upright|19th-century water tower]]

The [[Poor Clares' Church, Bydgoszcz|Church of the Assumption of the Holy Virgin]], commonly referred to as "The Church of [[Poor Clares]]," is a famous landmark of the city. It is a small, Gothic-Renaissance (including [[Neo-Renaissance]] additions), single-aisle church built between 1582 and 1602. The interior is rather austere since the church has been stripped of most of its furnishings. This is not a surprising fact, considering that in the 19th century the Prussian authorities dissolved the [[Order of Poor Ladies|Order of St Clare]] and turned the church into a warehouse, among other uses. Nonetheless, the church is worth visiting. In particular, the original wooden polychrome ceiling dating from the 17th century draws the attention of every visitor.

[[File:Bdg SpichrzStrPort 7 07-2013.jpg|thumb|left|The Old Port Granary built in 1835]]

''Wyspa Młyńska'' ([[Mill Island in Bydgoszcz|Mill Island]]) is among the most spectacular and atmospheric places in Bydgoszcz. What makes it unique is the location in the very heart of the city centre, just a few steps from the old Market Square. It was the 'industrial' centre of Bydgoszcz in the Middle Ages and for several hundred years thereafter, and it was here that the famous royal mint operated in the 17th century. Most of the buildings which can still be seen on the island date from the 19th century, but the so-called ''Biały Spichlerz'' (the White Granary) recalls the end of the 18th century. However, it is the water, footbridges, historic red-brick tenement houses reflected in the rivers, and the greenery, including old chestnut trees, that create the unique atmosphere of the island.

[[File:Bdg hotel Pod Orlem 2 07-2013.jpg|thumb|[[Hotel Pod Orlem, Bydgoszcz|Hotel Pod Orlem]]]]

[[Hotel "Pod Orlem" in Bydgoszcz|"Hotel pod Orłem"]] (The Eagle Hotel), an icon of the city's 19th-century architecture, was designed by the distinguished Bydgoszcz architect Józef Święcicki, the author of around sixty buildings in the city. Completed in 1896, it served as a hotel from the very beginning and was originally owned by Emil Bernhardt, a hotel manager educated in Switzerland. Its façade displays forms characteristic of the Neo-baroque style in architecture.

[[St. Vincent de Paul Basilica Minor in Bydgoszcz|Saint Vincent de Paul's Basilica]], erected between 1925 and 1939, is the largest church in Bydgoszcz and one of the biggest in Poland. It can accommodate around 12,000 people. This monumental church, modeled after the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome, was designed by the Polish architect Adam Ballenstaedt. The most characteristic element of the neo-classical temple is the reinforced concrete dome 40 metres in diameter.

The [[Grodzka Street in Bydgoszcz#Grain Granaries|three granaries]] in [[Grodzka Street in Bydgoszcz|Grodzka Street]], picturesquely located on the Brda River near the old Market Square, are the official symbol of the city. Built at the turn of the 19th century, they were originally used to store grain and similar products, but now house exhibitions of the city's Leon Wyczółkowski District Museum.

The building of the former [[Prussian Eastern Railway Headquarters, Bydgoszcz|Prussian Eastern Railway Headquarters]] erected between 1886 and 1889 in Dutch Mannierist style is another notable structure in the city. Initially it served as a headquarters of the Prussian Eastern Railway and later it belonged to the Polish State Railways. Since 2022 it is privately owned.

The city is mostly associated with water, sports, [[Art Nouveau]] buildings, waterfront, music, and urban greenery. Bydgoszcz boasts the largest city park in Poland (830 ha). The city was also once famous for its industry.

Some great monuments have been destroyed, for example, the church in the Old Market Square and the [[Former Municipal Theatre in Bydgoszcz|Municipal Theatre]]. Additionally, the Old Town lost a few characteristic tenement houses, including the western frontage of the Market Square. The city also lost its Gothic castle and defensive walls. In Bydgoszcz, there are a great number of villas in the style of typical [[Garden city movement|garden suburbs]].

[[JP Morgan Chase]], one of the largest financial institutions in the world, has established a branch in Bydgoszcz. Most industrial complexes are scattered throughout the city, however, the [[Zachem Chemical Plant in Bydgoszcz|'Zachem' chemical works]] deserve attention, covering tens of square kilometers in the south-east of the city, the remnants of the German explosives factory built in World War II occupy an area which has its own rail lines, internal communication, housing, and large forested area. the [[open-air museum]], [[Exploseum]], was built on its base.

Since 2001, Bydgoszcz has been annually subjected to international 'verification' ratings. In February 2008 the Agency '[[Fitch Ratings]]', recategorised the city, increasing its rating from BBB-(stable forecast) to BBB (stable estimate).

In 2004, Bydgoszcz launched an Industrial and Technology Park of 283 hectares, an attractive place for doing business as companies that relocate there receive tax breaks, 24-hour security, access to large plots of land and to the media, the railway line Chorzów Batory – Tczew (passenger, coal), the DK5 and DK10 national roads, and future freeways [[Expressway S10 (Poland)|S10]] and [[Expressway S5 (Poland)|S5]]. Bydgoszcz Airport is also close by.

[[File:Bdg kasyno 1a 05-2013.jpg|thumb|The Arts House on Gdańska Street, currently in the hands of [[Feliks Nowowiejski Music Academy]].]]
Bydgoszcz is a major cultural centre in the country, especially for music. Traditions of the municipal theatre date back to the 17th century, when the Jesuit college built a theatre. In 1824, a [[Former Municipal Theatre in Bydgoszcz|permanent theatre building]] was erected, and this was rebuilt in 1895 in a monumental form by the Berlin architect Heinrich Seeling. The first music school was established in Bydgoszcz in 1904; it had close links to the very well-known European piano factory of Bruno Sommerfeld. Numerous orchestras and choirs, both German (Gesangverein, Liedertafel) and Polish (St. Wojciech Halka, Moniuszko), have also made the city their home. Since 1974, Bydgoszcz has been home to a very prestigious [[Bydgoszcz Music Academy - "Feliks Nowowiejski"|Academy of Music]]. Bydgoszcz is also an important place for contemporary European culture; one of the most important European centers of jazz music, the Brain club, was founded in Bydgoszcz by Jacek Majewski and Slawomir Janicki.

Bydgoszcz was a candidate for the title of [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2016.

== Legends ==
It is said that [[Pan Twardowski]] spent some time in the city of Bydgoszcz, where, in his memory, a figure was recently mounted in a window of a tenement, overseeing the Old Town. At 1:13&nbsp;p.m. and 9:13&nbsp;p.m. the window opens and Pan Twardowski appears, to the accompaniment of weird music and devilish laughter. He takes a bow, waves his hand, and then disappears. This little show gathers crowds of amused spectators.
