It is the capital of the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[North Brabant]] and its fourth largest city by population. The city is south of the [[Meuse|Maas]] river and near the [[Waal (river)|Waal]].

== History ==
{{For timeline}}

The city's official name is a contraction of the (archaic) [[Dutch language|Dutch]] {{lang|nl|des Hertogen bosch}}&nbsp;— {{gloss|the forest of the duke}}. The duke in question was [[Henry&nbsp;I, Duke of Brabant]], whose family had owned a large estate at nearby Orthen for at least four centuries. He founded a new town located on some forested dunes in the middle of a marsh. At age 26, he granted 's-Hertogenbosch [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]] and the corresponding trade privileges in 1185. This is the traditional date given by later chroniclers; the first mention in contemporaneous sources is 1196. The original [[charter]] has been lost. His reason for founding the city was to protect his own interests against encroachment from [[Gelre]] and [[Holland]]; from its first days, he conceived of the city as a fortress. It was destroyed in 1203 in a joint expedition of Gelre and Holland, but was soon rebuilt. Some remnants of the original city walls remain.

[[File:Braun s-Hertogenbosch UBHD.jpg|thumb|left|300px|'s-Hertogenbosch in the 16th century]]
In the late 14th century, a much larger wall was erected to protect the greatly expanded settled area. Artificial waterways were dug to serve as a city moat, through which the rivers [[Dommel]] and [[Aa River (Meuse)|Aa]] were diverted. 's-Hertogenbosch became the birthplace and home of one of the greatest painters of the [[northern Renaissance]] period, [[Hieronymus Bosch]].

Until 1520, the city flourished, becoming the second largest population centre in the territory of the present Netherlands, after [[Utrecht]]. The city was also a center of music, and composers, such as [[Jheronimus Clibano]], received their training at its churches. Others held positions there: [[Matthaeus Pipelare]] was musical director at the Confraternity of Our Lady; and renowned Habsburg copyist and composer [[Pierre Alamire]] did much of his work at 's-Hertogenbosch.

=== Eighty Years' War ===
The wars of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] changed the course of the city's history. It became an independent [[bishopric]]. During the [[Eighty Years' War]], the city took the side of the [[Habsburg]] ([[Catholic Church|Catholic]]) authorities and thwarted a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] coup. It was besieged several times by Prince [[Maurice of Nassau|Maurice]] of [[Principality of Orange|Orange]], [[stadtholder]] of most of the [[Dutch Republic]], who wanted to bring 's-Hertogenbosch under the rule of the rebel United Provinces. The city was successfully defended against Prince Maurice in [[Siege of 's-Hertogenbosch (1601)|1601]] and again in 1603,<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Coetzee |first1=Daniel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DW2jAQAAQBAJ |title=Philosophers of War: The Evolution of History's Greatest Military Thinkers |last2=Eysturlid |first2=Lee W. |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-313-07033-4 |pages=118 |language=en}}</ref> but it eventually fell in the [[Siege of 's-Hertogenbosch|1629 siege]] led by his brother [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange|Frederick Henry]].<ref name="Knight">Knight, Charles Raleigh: ''Historical records of The Buffs, East Kent Regiment (3rd Foot) formerly designated the Holland Regiment and Prince George of Denmark's Regiment''.

In the [[Twelve Years' Truce|years of Truce]], before the renewed fighting after 1618, the fortifications were greatly expanded. The surrounding marshes made a siege of the conventional type impossible, and the fortress, deemed impregnable, was nicknamed ''moerasdraak'', or the Swamp Dragon.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Siege of the Swamp Dragon |url=https://www.bada.org/object/siege-swamp-dragon |access-date=25 April 2023 |website=bada.org |publisher=[[British Antique Dealers' Association]]}}</ref> The town was nevertheless finally conquered by [[Frederik Hendrik of Orange]] in 1629 in a typically Dutch stratagem: he diverted the rivers Dommel and Aa, created a [[polder]] by constructing a forty-kilometre (25 mile) [[dike (construction)|dyke]] and then pumped out the water by mills. After a siege of three months, the city had to surrender—an enormous blow to Habsburg geo-political strategy during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. This surrender cut the town off from the rest of the duchy and the area was treated by the Republic as an [[occupation zone]] without political liberties (see also [[Generality Lands]]).

=== Louis XIV to Bonaparte ===
After the [[Peace of Westphalia]], the fortifications were again expanded. In 1672, the Dutch ''[[rampjaar]]'', the city held against the army of [[Louis XIV]] of France. In 1794 French revolutionary troops under the command of [[Charles Pichegru]] attacked the city. It was only weakly defended, and fell after a short siege. Pichegru then crossed the rivers and put an end to the Dutch Republic.

Under the new [[Batavian Republic]], established in 1795, both Catholics and ''Brabanders'' at last gained equal rights. From 1806, the city became part of the [[Kingdom of Holland]] and from 1810, it was incorporated into the [[First French Empire]]. It was captured by the [[Prussia]]ns in 1814.

=== Kingdom of the Netherlands ===
The next year, 1815, when the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was established, it became the capital of [[North Brabant]]. Many newer and more modern fortresses were created in the vicinity of the city. A new canal was built, the 'Zuid-Willemsvaart', which gave the city an economic impulse. Trade, manufacturing and industry grew. Until 1878, it was forbidden to build outside the ramparts. That led to overcrowding and the highest [[infant mortality]] in the kingdom.

At the end of the 19th century, the very conservative city government prevented industrial investment to avoid an increase in the number of workers and the establishment of educational institutions: students were regarded as disorderly. As a result, the relative importance of the city diminished.

===World War II and after===
[[File:Voorgevel - 's-Hertogenbosch - 20110416 - RCE.jpg|thumb|upright|{{Interlanguage link|De Moriaan|nl}}]]
One of the few official [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]] complexes in [[Western Europe]] outside Germany and [[Austria]] was named after 's-Hertogenbosch. It operated from January 1943, to September 1944 and was known to the Germans as [[Herzogenbusch]] (see List of subcamps of Herzogenbusch). About 30,000 inmates were interned in the complex during this time, of whom about 12,000&nbsp;were [[Jew]]s. In the Netherlands, this camp is known as 'Kamp [[Vught]]', because the concentration camp was actually located at a heath near Vught, a village a few kilometres south of 's-Hertogenbosch.

The city was occupied by German forces during [[World War II]] from 1940 to 1945. The railway station was bombed by planes of the [[Royal Air Force]] on 16 September 1944. The city was liberated between 24 and 27&nbsp;October 1944&nbsp;during [[Operation Pheasant]] by [[British Army|British soldiers]] of [[major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Robert Knox Ross (British Army officer)|Robert Knox Ross]]'s [[53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division]] following the victory of the 1st Battalion, [[East Lancashire Regiment]], of [[158th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|158th Infantry Brigade]] over the enemy on 23–24 October.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rory Bremner salutes his East Lancashire war hero dad |url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/leisure/tv/4725324.Rory_Bremner_salutes_his_East_Lancashire_war_hero_dad/ |website=Lancashire Telegraph |date=6 November 2009 |access-date=2015-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404172449/http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/leisure/tv/4725324.Rory_Bremner_salutes_his_East_Lancashire_war_hero_dad/ |archive-date=2015-04-04 |url-status=live }}</ref>

After the war, 's-Hertogenbosch was modernized, like many other cities in the Netherlands. It was possible that it was only the geography that shielded the old town from rigorous reconstruction in those early years. Just in time, the pendulum swung back to protecting the history of the city. In 1956, the council wanted to demolish the Moriaan, the oldest brick building in the Netherlands, to give traffic better access to the market square. The permit was refused by the government and instead the building was restored, starting in 1963. Later, city councils became much more aware of the value of historic buildings and from about the turn of the millennium, the historic fortifications are also given much attention by the authorities.

===Carnival celebrations===
[[File:PeervaandenMuggenheuvel.jpg|thumb|right|Mayor Ton Rombouts, the Mayor of Oeteldonk, and the prince at City Hall in 2007]]
's-Hertogenbosch has a strong [[carnival]] tradition. In its current form the story and symbolism dates from 1881 to 1883. In these years some citizens created the legend of "Oeteldonk", whereby the city was renamed to Oeteldonk for the three day carnival. "Donk" is a reference to a dry place in the [[marsh]]. The frog is widely used as a symbol during the 's-Hertogenbosch Carnival. It is also a symbol of the Oeteldonk [[marsh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oetelpedia.nl/wiki/index.php/Oeteldonk |title=Oeteldonk – Oetelpedia |language=nl |publisher=Oetelpedia.nl |date=2010-11-17 |access-date=2013-03-25}}</ref> It was also a remark aimed at Bishop Godschalk from Den Dungen, where 'Van den Oetelaar' was a common family name. He had wanted to forbid the traditional festivities of [[Shrove Tuesday]] that often led to excesses.

Oeteldonk is a village and therefore every inhabitant is a farmer or a '{{lang|nl|durske}}' (a girl or young woman), eliminating class differences.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.oeteldonk.org/over-oeteldonk/geschiedenis/1882-1945 |title= De stichting van Oeteldonk en de decennia daarna (1882-1945) |trans-title= The foundation of Oeteldonk and the subsequent decades|language= nl |publisher= Oeteldonksche Club van 1882 |date= 2020-06-28 |access-date=2020-06-28}}</ref> The village is headed by the Mayor "Peer vaan den Muggenheuvel tot den Bobberd". Each year the mayor of 's-Hertogenbosch hands over his authority to the Mayor of Oeteldonk. On Sunday at 11:11 AM the Mayor of Oeteldonk then receives Prince Carnaval "Prince Amadeiro XXVI" at Oeteldonk central station. From there a parade of all carnival clubs escorts the company to the town hall.

The citizens of 's-Hertogenbosch wear traditional outfits throughout these days. A so-called ''boerenkiel'' is worn and every year patches are designed according to that years theme which can then be stitched onto the outfit. The ''boerenkiel'' is often combined with a traditional farmers bandana and a long scarf in the colors of Oeteldonk. The tradition of the Boerenkiel and / or Bandana is very different from the carnival traditions in the rest of the Netherlands. Other aspects like the parade, the temporary name and the temporary flag (for Oeteldonk red, white and yellow) are very similar.

's-Hertogenbosch was founded as a fortified city and that heritage can still be seen today. After World War II, plans were made to modernise the old city, by filling in the canals, removing or modifying some ramparts and redeveloping historic neighbourhoods. Before these plans could come to effect, the central government declared the city a protected townscape. Most historic elements have been preserved. In contrast to cities like [[Rotterdam]], 's-Hertogenbosch also survived the [[Second World War]] relatively unscathed. Much of its historic heritage remains intact, and today there are always renovations going on in the city to preserve the many old buildings, fortifications, churches and statues for later generations.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}

=== City center ===
[[File:'s-Hertogenbosch Rijksmonument 21719 Stadhuis, Markt 1.JPG|left|thumb|City Hall of 's-Hertogenbosch]]
[[File:'s-Hertogenbosch Marktplein - Den Bosch Markt.jpg|thumb|Market square]]
The city center has a cosy atmosphere because of the almost continuous ramparts that still surround it. It has been molded by the multiple rivers that convene on 's-Hertogenbosch, giving the center its strange street plan so different from the usual [[grid plan]] where streets meet at right angles. The center is dominated by [[St. John's Cathedral, 's-Hertogenbosch|Saint John's Cathedral]] (''Sint-Janskathedraal'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]), which dates from c. 1220 and is best known for its [[Brabantine Gothic]] design and the many sculptures of craftsmen that are sitting on almost every arc and rim along the outside of the cathedral. In 2010 an extensive restoration was completed, undoing the damage of many years of wear-and-tear and [[acid rain]].

On the central square is the oldest remaining brick house of the Netherlands, 'de Moriaan',<ref>[http://www.teletijd.nl/moriaan/ Teletijd.nl: 'De Moriaan' before and after renovation]</ref> which was built at the beginning of the 13th century. In the 1960s, de Moriaan was renovated to its former glory based on a famous 16th-century Dutch painting called 'De Lakenmarkt van 's-Hertogenbosch' ('The fabric market of 's-Hertogenbosch').<ref>[https://archive.org/details/DeLakenmarktTeu2019sHertogenboschCirca1530 Painting: De Lakenmarkt van 's-Hertogenbosch]</ref> The town hall is an original 14th-century Gothic building. After the town was conquered by the Dutch Republic in 1629, it received a new facade in the style of  [[Dutch Baroque architecture]]. It showcased the authority of the new masters, just like the new town hall in Maastricht would.

Hidden below the old city is a [[canal]] network called the [[Binnendieze]], which once spanned {{Cvt|22|km|0}}. It started out as a regular river, the Dommel, running through the city in medieval times. Due to a lack of space in the city, people started building their houses and roads over the river. Later, the Binnendieze functioned as a sewer and fell into disrepair. In recent decades, the remaining sixth part of the old waterway system has been renovated, and it is possible to take several guided subterranean boat trips through it.

=== Fortifications ===
[[File:Stadsmuurdenboschnl.jpg|thumb|left|City rampart]]
[[File:'s-Hertogenbosch - Citadellaan - Vestingwerken.jpg|thumb|[[Citadel of 's-Hertogenbosch]]]]
[[File:Boze Griet.JPG|thumb|''Boze Griet'', a forged cannon from 1510 in the ''Bastionder'']]
's-Hertogenbosch has an extensive and almost complete fifteenth-to-seventeenth-century city fortification. It was made to profit from the city's strong defensive position, lying on a sandy hill in the center of a large swamp fed by many rivers. This also caused the main ramparts to be preserved, because they were crucial in keeping out the water. In 2004 the city was awarded the title ''European Fortress City of the year''. In the years that followed it restored many of the city defenses to much of their old glory.

Apart from small sections of medieval walls, the main structure of the fortification is a late-medieval (fifteenth-century) wall. The upper sections were removed when cannon became more powerful, and polygonal [[Bastion fort|bastions]] were added, some after the conquest by the republic. Most of these have not been restored to their original height, but do maintain their brick walls. The [[Citadel of 's-Hertogenbosch|citadel]] in the north west of the city does retain its original height. Around the city itself many other fortresses can still be seen.

In the north east of the old city, the hexagonal [[gunpowder magazine]], called {{lang|nl|Kruithuis}}<ref>[http://www.teletijd.nl/kruithuis/ Teletijd.nl: Kruithuis inner court]</ref> is located close to the citadel. It is one of only a handful that still exist in the Netherlands, and was built when the city was still part of the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. It is planned to become the museum of fortress 's-Hertogenbosch. One of the bastions of the fortress now houses the mini museum [[Bastionder]]. It has been dug out in a bastion of the south side. On the inside it shows a unique wrought iron cannon, and an older bastion that was walled in by the current one.

=== Nature ===
[[File:Sint-Janskathedraal, Het Bossche Broek, 's-Hertogenbosch.jpg|thumb|View on the St. Jan from Bossche Broek]]
On the south side of the city, the city center and walls still border the Bossche Broek, an old [[polder]] that could never be made dry. In 1995 the dyke of the Dommel broke and an enormous amount of water entered the polder. It also flooded and blocked the main Dutch highway A2. In order to prevent this in the future, the area was rearranged to store excess water in case of emergencies. In 2006 the area had been furnished with higher dikes and locks that allowed a controlled flooding of the polder and some adjacent areas in case of emergency.

The Bossche Broek is now a {{Convert|22|ha|adj=on}} [[nature reserve]], that stretches all the way to [[Vught]]. It is connected to the Moerputten and Vlijmens Ven, with which it forms a [[Natura 2000]] area. Rare species in the area are the [[scarce large blue]] and the [[European weather loach]]. The Moerputten sports the [[Moerputten Bridge]], a 600 metre (650 yard) long nineteenth century railway bridge and engineering feat. What is unique about the area is its close proximity to the city center.

=== Miscellaneous ===
The city is also the location of the ''[[Bolwoningen]]'' complex, an array of fifty experimental spherical houses designed by Dries Kreijkamp.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://realestate.aol.com/blog/gallery/the-worlds-ugliest-buildings/#photo-3 |title=The Worlds Ugliest Buildings – AOL Real Estate |publisher=Realestate.aol.com |access-date=2013-03-25}}</ref>

The [[Lutheran Church, 's-Hertogenbosch]] is no longer used as a church.

==Sport==
The city has one professional football club, [[FC Den Bosch]]. It is the 1967 successor of the professional branches of BVV (Bossche Voetbal Vereniging) and Wilhelmina. Both of them still exist as amateur football clubs. As a successor of BVV FC Den Bosch can claim the national championship of 1948. This championship led to the construction of stadium [[De Vliert]], which at one time had a capacity of 30,000. Due to the less successful years that followed, the capacity is now only 8,500 visitors. FC Den Bosch was the first club of Dutch international player [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]].

's-Hertogenbosch is more successful in field hockey. It is home to top club [[HC 's-Hertogenbosch|HC Den Bosch]]. The women's team in particular is a dominant force in the Dutch field hockey competition. The professional basketball club [[EiffelTowers Den Bosch|New Heroes Den Bosch]] is also very successful. The city's rugby club is called The Dukes and dates from 1974. It is located at a very scenic location at the foot of the city walls. Because of the limited space, the club plays on [[artificial turf]] and part of the accommodation is subterranean. The Dukes has the most junior members. It became the national rugby champion in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |title=Geschiedenis van The Dukes |url=https://www.dukesrugby.nl/ |access-date=2021-12-09}}</ref>

As regards events the city is host to the [[Rosmalen Grass Court Championships]], a combined [[ATP Tour]] and [[WTA Tour]] grass court tennis event played two weeks before the [[Wimbledon Championships]]. The [[World Archery Championships]] and [[World Para Archery Championship]] were held here in June 2019. During these combined World Championships two separate venues were used: the Parade and the rugby fields of The Dukes. All finals took place in the arena at the Parade. The Parade is a historic square surrounded by high trees, situated at the foot of the nearly seven-hundred-year-old Saint John's Cathedral in the attractive center of 's-Hertogenbosch.

The [[Zuid-Willemsvaart]] runs from the Meuse just north of the city towards Maastricht via Helmond and Weert. In 's-Hertogenbosch it runs through the city proper, south east from where a bastion has been cut off from the citadel. Because of this route it was impossible to widen it further than for ships of [[Classification of European Inland Waterways|CEMT]] class II. Therefore, the [[Máxima Canal]] of 8&nbsp;km (5 miles) was dug just east of the city, creating a shortcut from the canal to the Meuse suitable for ships of CEMT class IV. On the remaining part of the Zuid-Willemsvaart west of the city is the industrial harbor of 's-Hertogenbosch. A marina is located in the center.

's-Hertogenbosch is situated on the busy [[A2 motorway (Netherlands)|A2 motorway]], the most important north–south connection of the Netherlands. This connection was established with the opening of the [[Dieze Bridge]] in 1942. From 1961 the Utrecht-'s-Hertogenbosch section was 2 times 2 lanes. In 1970 the A2 was rerouted to the east of the city. In 1989 it finally became a [[controlled-access highway]]. In 1996 the section between 's-Hertogenbosch and [[Eindhoven]] became a controlled-access highway. The situation in [[Maastricht]] was only solved in 2016, when the Koning Willem-Alexandertunnel was opened. On the east–west axis 's-Hertogenbosch is on the [[List of motorways in the Netherlands|A59 motorway]]. The [[A65 motorway (Netherlands)|A65 motorway]] between 's-Hertogenbosch and [[Tilburg]] is a regional highway, but is not completely access-controlled.

[['s-Hertogenbosch railway station]] is on the [[Utrecht–Boxtel railway|Utrecht–Boxtel part]] of the railway stretch between Amsterdam and the Dutch industrial/tech center near Eindhoven. As a consequence north–south trains depart every ten minutes. On the [[Tilburg–Nijmegen railway]] trains run on a more modest schedule. 's-Hertogenbosch railway station is also a major station for [[Arriva]] buslines that serve the city and most of its suburbs. Other stations within the limits of the municipality are [['s-Hertogenbosch Oost railway station]] and [[Rosmalen railway station]]. [[Vught railway station]] is actually closer to the city center than that in Rosmalen.

's-Hertogenbosch has attempted to adapt to the growing popularity of the bicycle in Dutch cities. A reasonable amount of bike paths has so far been constructed in the town. In 2011, the city was chosen as ''[[Cycling in the Netherlands#The Fietsstad (Bicycle city) awards|Fietsstad 2011]]''—the top bike city of the Netherlands for 2011. The details of the report were less jubilant and showed that it was really a prize meant to stimulate 's-Hertogenbosch to take further action; Hugo van der Steenhoven of the Fietsersbond: "''In the past years Den Bosch has spent much energy, ambition, creativity and money to give cycling an enormous boost. This is a big achievement for a city where bicycle use is lower than in the rest of the Netherlands''" (cyclist union).<ref>{{cite news |url= https://nos.nl/artikel/314111-den-bosch-fietsstad-van-2011.html |title= Den Bosch fietsstad van 2011 |trans-title = 's-Hertogenbosch bicycle city 2011 | language=nl |date= 2011-11-17 |publisher= NOS }}</ref>

==Education==
's-Hertogenbosch has multiple [[vocational university|vocational universities]] called ''Hogeschool'' in Dutch. The [[HAS University of Applied Sciences|HAS Hogeschool]] of about 3,500 students is focused on agricultural and food technology. [[Avans University of Applied Sciences|Avans Hogeschool]] is located in 's-Hertogenbosch and two nearby cities. The [[AKV St. Joost]] is an art academy that is now part of Avans and dates back to 1812.<ref>[http://www.akvstjoost.nl/en AKV|St.Joost] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055337/http://www.akvstjoost.nl/en |date=2013-09-21 }}. Retrieved 7 October 2016.</ref> [[Fontys University of Applied Sciences|Fontys Hogeschool]] also offers some education in the city. The [[Jheronimus Academy of Data Science]] (JADS), located at the Mariënburg Campus in the center of 's-Hertogenbosch, and provides a number of [[data science]] programs at graduate ([[MSc]]) and post-graduate level ([[PhD]]).<ref>[http://www.jads.nl/education1.html JADS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313130728/http://www.jads.nl/education1.html |date=2017-03-13 }}. Retrieved 12 March 2017.</ref> It is a department of the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]] and [[Tilburg University]].

In [[secondary education]] the [[City Gymnasium ('s-Hertogenbosch)|City Gymnasium]] is a [[gymnasium (school)]] that originated from the Latin school of the city. It is comparable to a [[grammar school]] and can trace its origin back 1274. The same type of education and all other types of secondary education are offered by a number of large institutes.

Roman Catholicism is the dominant religion in 's-Hertogenbosch, with somewhat more than 40% of the population counting themselves as belonging to it. Even so, attendance at mass is significantly lower than 40%. Three churches in the city center are still in use by the Catholic church: Saint John's Cathedral, Saint Catherine and the Monastery Church of the Franciscans nearby the railway station. Smaller churches in use by the Roman Catholic church are: Saint Anne's Church in Hintham, Saint Landoline Church in Empel, Saint Willibrord Church in Maaspoort, Saint Lambert Church (Rosmalen), etc.

The Protestant religion has seen its share of believers in the city fall from 20% to about 4%. It is based in the [[Great Church, 's-Hertogenbosch|Great Church]]. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] is a new church in town. It is based at [[St. Catherine's Church, 's-Hertogenbosch|Saint Catherine's Church]] where Catholic worship services have been held again since 2021.

The Arrahma Mosque has been built by the Moroccan community. The Turkish community has the Orhan Gazi Mosque.
