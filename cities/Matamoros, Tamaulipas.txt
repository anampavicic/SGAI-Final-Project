==History==
===Prehispanic history===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2023}}
The Indigenous people of the area are known as the Esto’k G’na or by their colonized name, the [http://www.carrizocomecrudonation.com/ Carrizo Comecrudo Tribe of Texas]. There are hundreds of members across South Texas, with many more descendants in the Brownsville-Matamoros metropolitan area, however, due to the violence of colonialism in the area, many residents are unable to trace their family history far back enough to know if they are descendants or not.

===Foundation===
In 1519, the same year that [[Hernán Cortés]] arrived at the port of [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Veracruz History|url=http://www.explorandomexico.com/state/29/Veracruz/history/|publisher=Explorando Mexico}}</ref> a captain named [[Alonso Álvarez de Pineda]] carried out a brief expedition to the region of northern Tamaulipas, where he named the town known today as [[Río Bravo, Tamaulipas|Rio Bravo]] (Rio Grande) as Rio de las Palmas (Palms River).<ref name="e-local1">{{cite web|title=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México ESTADO DE TAMAULIPAS|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/tamaulipas/municipios/28022a.htm|access-date=24 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603201744/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/tamaulipas/municipios/28022a.htm|archive-date=3 June 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Nevertheless, the actual founding of Matamoros began in 1686, when Captain [[Alonso de León]] explored the area and concluded that the Rio Grande was an excellent route for navigation, and that the area of Matamoros was an ideal spot for cattle raising.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rendón de la Garza|first=Clemente|title=Vidas Ilustres|url=http://blue.utb.edu/localhistory/bio.htm#General%20Alonso%20de%20Leon%20%22El%20Mozo%22|publisher=University of Texas at Brownsville|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050107044208/http://blue.utb.edu/localhistory/bio.htm#General%20Alonso%20de%20Leon%20%22El%20Mozo%22|archive-date=7 January 2005}}</ref>

In the year 1749, thirteen enterprising families, twelve from [[Camargo, Tamaulipas|Camargo]] and one from [[Reynosa]], decided to invest and begin a new, influential [[cattle industry]] in the area.<ref>{{cite web|title=MATAMOROS – La Gran Puerta de Mexico|url=http://www.mimatamorosquerido.com/historia.htm|access-date=24 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004172429/http://www.mimatamorosquerido.com/historia.htm|archive-date=4 October 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Former landowners were skeptical that this new investment would be successful, since the frequent overflow of the Rio Grande caused severe floods, and because ranches were occasionally attacked by Indians. Nonetheless, these thirteen families effectively carried out their business plan and created 113 cattle-raising sites. In the year 1774, they officially named the area San Juan de los Esteros Hermosos, known today as Matamoros.<ref>{{cite news|last=Treviño|first=Oscar|title=Mi Matamoros Querido|url=http://www.elbravomatamoros.com/elespecial_impresion.aspx?noticia=3|newspaper=Periódico El Bravo}}</ref>

In 1793, to colonize the province of [[Nuevo Santander]], two Franciscan missionaries named Francisco Pueyes and Manuel Júlio Silva established a parish in the main [[plaza]] of Matamoros. They proposed a new name for the community: Villa del Refugio, in honor of the parish and patron saint, Our Lady of the Refuge of the Estuaries.<ref>{{cite book|title=Matamoros|publisher=Sección Amarilla|page=388|url=http://papelweb.seccionamarilla.com/doc/seccionamarilla-directorios_mexico/matamoros/2011012701/14.html#15}}</ref>

===Mexican independence===
In 1826, the governor Lucas Fernandez dispatched a decree to change the name of the city to Matamoros, in honor of [[Mariano Matamoros]], a hero of the [[Mexican War of Independence]], who participated along with [[José María Morelos]].<ref>{{cite web|title=MARIANO MATAMOROS, 1770–1814|url=http://www.bicentenario.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=69:mariano-matamoros-1770-1814&catid=84:biografias-independencia}}</ref> During the [[Texas Revolution]] (1836), Matamoros was the fortress for many Mexican soldiers against rebel attacks.<ref>{{cite web|last=Roell|first=Craig H.|title=MATAMOROS EXPEDITION OF 1835–36|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qdm01|publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}</ref>

In 1851, the city of Matamoros was again heroic for defending against attacks by troops under [[José María Jesús Carbajal]], many of whom were recruited from within [[Texas]], who sought to establish a federal republic against the centralist government of Mexico City. The federal troops of Francisco Avalos were able to repel their enemy,<ref>{{cite web|title=Matamoros Heróica|url=http://www.matamoros.gob.mx/municipio/resena/heroica.asp|publisher=Gobierno Municipal de Matamoros|access-date=24 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927044723/http://www.matamoros.gob.mx/municipio/resena/heroica.asp|archive-date=27 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the state congress granted Matamoros the title of "Heroic", countersigned by the Mexican Congress, hence the city's official name of Heroica Matamoros.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dávila Gómez|first=Alfonso|title=Breve Historia de Matamoros|url=http://www.matamoros.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=148:breve-historia-de-matamoros&catid=82:mat-historia&Itemid=459}}</ref>

===Texas Revolution===
{{Expand section|date=November 2011}}
The city of Matamoros was a strategic and fortified city during the [[Texas Revolution]]. The [[Matamoros Expedition]] was launched to attack Matamoros and defeat the forces of [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]]. It proved controversial and divisive. The roots of the controversy lay in the division within the provisional government between Governor [[Henry Smith (Texas Governor)|Henry Smith]] and the General Council over whether to remain loyal to the [[Constitution of 1824]] and support the liberals of Mexico in the Federalist cause against Santa Anna or to declare independence from Mexico and seek to become an independent territory. The division, on the other hand, was mirrored within the provisional government and among the commanders in the field, who compounded the situation and contributed to the near destruction of [[Texian Army|the Texian army]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Craig H. |first=Roell |title=MATAMOROS EXPEDITION OF 1835–36 |work=Handbook of Texas Online |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qdm01 |access-date= 16 December 2011 |publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}</ref>

===American Civil War===
At the beginning of the [[American Civil War]], the city of Matamoros was simply a sleepy little border town across the Rio Grande from Brownsville.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Delaney|first=Robert W.| title=Matamoros, Port for Texas during the Civil War|journal=The Southwestern Historical Quarterly| year=1955|volume=58|issue=4| publisher=Texas State Historical Association| issn=0038-478X| page=487| jstor=30241907}}</ref> It had, for several years, been considered a port, but it had relatively few ships arriving.

A Union general in 1865 described the importance of the port in Matamoros:

{{blockquote|Matamoros is to the rebellion west of the Mississippi what New York is to the United States—its great commercial and financial center, feeding and clothing the rebellion, arming and equipping, furnishing it materials of war and a specie basis of circulation that has almost displaced Confederate paper ...

Since the 1970s, and especially during the 1990s, after the initiation of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], foreign investment has multiplied in Matamoros, resulting in an enormous population growth, prominently from other Mexican states, like [[San Luis Potosí]] and [[Veracruz]].{{citation needed|date=March 2023}}

Many major crimes have occurred in Matamoros, including the [[Murder of Mark Kilroy|1989 murder of an American tourist]], a [[1999 Matamoros standoff|1999 standoff]] and a [[2011 Matamoros mass kidnapping|2011 mass kidnapping]].

==Economy==
===Industrial sector===
The economy of Matamoros depends primarily on its proximity to the United States, due to the importance of the strong presence of [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] in the area. [[Maquiladoras]] are a direct representation of American presence in the state of Tamaulipas; the trade of goods through the international bridges and the flow of people on both sides of the border play a huge role in the economic posture of Matamoros.

Matamoros is home to more than 122 maquiladoras dedicated in its majority to export to the United States. This industry produces technological goods like cables, electrical appliances, electrical components, vehicle parts and accessories, textiles, chemical products, machinery, and computer products.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lobatón Huerta|first=Guillermo|title=Industria Maquiladora|journal=Instituto Tecnológico de Monterrey C. Puebla|date=27 August 2004|url=http://html.rincondelvago.com/industria-maquiladora.html}}</ref> The city operates about 35% of the Tamaulipas' maquiladora industry, placing second, just behind [[Reynosa]].

===Commercial sector===
This economic activity is the second most important in the city of Matamoros, generating approximately 13.5% of the total employment in the municipality. The rapid growth of the population in Matamoros, along with an increase in incomes, have amplified the demand of satisfiers in the area.<ref>{{cite web|title=Comercio en Matamoros|url=http://www.matamoros.gob.mx/municipio/comercio/default.asp|work=Sitio de Internet de la Administración Municipal|publisher=Gobierno Municipal de Matamoros|access-date=24 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927044758/http://www.matamoros.gob.mx/municipio/comercio/default.asp|archive-date=27 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the whole state of Tamaulipas, Matamoros places first in terms of jobs and businesses generated by foreign investment in the area, comprising a total of 238 companies, 36% of the state's whole business sector.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inversión Extranjera Directa|url=http://www.matamoros.gob.mx/municipio/comercio/inversion.asp|publisher=Gobierno Municipal de Matamoros|access-date=24 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927044809/http://www.matamoros.gob.mx/municipio/comercio/inversion.asp|archive-date=27 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Agricultural sector===
The rural area of Matamoros encompasses 97 communities, with more than 36,096 inhabitants in these small agrarian sectors. Traditionally, the city was eminently agricultural, cultivating [[sorghum]], corn, beans, vegetables, and sunflower by millions each year. The terrain in Matamoros categorized in two factions: [[gley soil]], land that is only used for grazing by livestock, and [[arable land]], used solely for growing crops.<ref>{{cite web|title=Agriculture|url=http://www.implanmatamoros.gob.mx/deseco/agricultura.asp#|publisher=IMPLAN Matamoros}}</ref>

The municipality of Matamoros is within the [[Rio Grande]] river basin, and by means of irrigation, the agricultural sector flourishes in production.{{vague|date=March 2019}}{{quantify|date=March 2019}} The two main water suppliers are the Rio Grande and the Arroyo del Tigre, which have dams that irrigate the region.<ref name="e-local1"/>

===Livestock production===
The bovine is the most predominant livestock in the municipality of Matamoros, and the [[commercialization]] of its meat is the principal income of ranchers in the region. In fact, livestock production goes as the following: [[bovine]] (62%), pigs (16%), and sheep (9%).<ref>{{cite web|title=Pecuario|url=http://www.implanmatamoros.gob.mx/deseco/pecuario.asp|publisher=IMPLAN|access-date=24 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327171314/http://www.implanmatamoros.gob.mx/deseco/pecuario.asp|archive-date=27 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the northern part of Tamaulipas, near the municipality of Matamoros, the breeding of [[Calf (animal)|calves]] is characterized and well known for having European blood.
