'''Chandler''' is a city in [[Maricopa County, Arizona]], United States, and a suburb in the [[Phoenix Metropolitan Area|Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. It is the [[List of municipalities in Arizona|fourth-most populous city]] in Arizona, after [[Mesa]], [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. Chandler is considered to be a part of the [[East Valley (Phoenix metropolitan area)|East Valley]].

As of the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], the population of Chandler was 275,987,<ref name=":Census 2020"/> up from 236,123 at the 2010 census.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_DP_DPDP1&prodType=table |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190521214830/https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_DP_DPDP1&prodType=table |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 21, 2019 |title=American FactFinder – Results |author=Data Access and Dissemination Systems (DADS) |work=census.gov }}</ref> Chandler is a commercial and tech hub for corporations like [[Intel]], [[Northrop Grumman]], [[Wells Fargo]], [[PayPal]] and [[Boeing]].

== History ==
In 1891, [[Alexander J. Chandler|Dr. Alexander John Chandler]], a Canadian and the first veterinary surgeon in the [[Arizona Territory]], settled on a ranch south of [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]] and studied [[irrigation]] engineering. By 1900, he had acquired {{convert|18000|acre|km2}} of land and began drawing up plans for a town-site on what was then known as the Chandler Ranch. The town-site office opened on May 16, 1912.

The original town-site was bounded by Galveston Street to the north, Frye Road to the south, Hartford Street to the west, and Hamilton Street to the east.<ref>{{cite web |title=Driving Chandler's Streets |url=https://www.cgc.maricopa.edu/Library/communityHistory/Chandler%20Streets/chandler_home.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128074345/https://www.cgc.maricopa.edu/Library/communityHistory/Chandler%20Streets/chandler_home.html |archive-date=January 28, 2016 |access-date=June 16, 2015 |work=maricopa.edu}}</ref> By 1913, a town center was established, featuring the Hotel San Marcos, which also had the first grass golf course in the state. [[Chandler High School (Chandler, Arizona)|Chandler High School]] was established in 1914. Chandler was officially incorporated on February 16, 1920, after 186 residents petitioned the [[Maricopa County Board of Supervisors]] to approve [[Municipal corporation|incorporation]].{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

Most of Chandler's economy was sustained during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] (though the Depression was to blame for the cancellation of a second San Marcos hotel), but the cotton crash a few years later had a much deeper impact on the city's residents. A. J. Chandler lost his San Marcos hotel to creditors as a result.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Chandler History, Visitor Info & Photos {{!}} About Chandler AZ |url=https://www.visitchandler.com/plan-your-visit/about/history/ |access-date=March 21, 2024 |website=www.visitchandler.com |language=en-us}}</ref> Later, the founding of [[Williams Air Force Base]] in 1941 led to a small surge in population, but Chandler still only held 3,800 people by 1950.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

By 1980, the population had grown to 30,000, and it has since paced the Phoenix metropolitan area's high rate of growth, with suburban residential areas and commercial use areas swallowing former agricultural plots. The population has nearly doubled in the last twenty years. Some of this growth was fueled by the establishment of manufacturing plants for communications and computing firms such as [[Microchip Technology|Microchip]], [[Motorola]] and [[Intel]].

== Geography ==
According to the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], Chandler has a total area of {{convert|65.55|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|0.07|sqmi|2}}, or 0.11%, are listed as water.<ref name=":Census 2020">{{Cite web |title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Chandler city, Arizona |url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/chandlercityarizona/PST045222 |access-date=March 20, 2024 |website=www.census.gov |language=en}}</ref> The center of the city, along [[Arizona State Route 87]], is {{Convert|22|mi}} southeast of [[Downtown Phoenix]].

Chandler is in proximity to/borders the San-Tan mountain range. The San-Tan mountains are in the jurisdiction of the [[Gila River Indian Community]].

Chandler is divided into three parts: North Chandler, West Chandler and South Chandler, each being divided by the [[Arizona State Route 202|Loop 202]] (Santan Freeway) and [[Arizona State Route 101|Loop 101]] (Price Freeway).
