'''Cairns''' ({{IPAc-en|audio= EnAU-Cairns.ogg|ˈ|k|ɛər|n|z}}; {{langx|yii|Gimuy}}) is a city in the [[Cairns Region]], [[Queensland]], Australia,<ref>{{Cite QPN|5683|Cairns|city|access-date=26 June 2017}}</ref> on the tropical north east coast of [[Far North Queensland]]. In the {{CensusAU|2021}}, Cairns had a population of 153,181 people.<ref name="Census2021" />

The city was founded in 1876 and named after [[William Cairns|Sir William Wellington Cairns]], following the discovery of gold in the [[Hodgkinson Minerals Area|Hodgkinson River]].<ref name=":4">{{Cite news |date=9 October 1876 |title=The Electoral Rolls. |page=3 |work=[[The Telegraph (Brisbane)]] |issue=1,246 |location=Queensland, Australia |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article174709204 |access-date=5 September 2018 |via=National Library of Australia |archive-date=1 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210201131931/https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/174709204 |url-status=live }}</ref>  During [[World War II]], the city became a staging ground for the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] in the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].

[[File:NativeWellsCairns.png|thumb|left|1874 map showing native wells situated within the future site of Cairns]]
From 1770 to the early 1870s the area was known to the British simply as [[Trinity Bay (Queensland)|Trinity Bay]]. The arrival of [[sea cucumber as food|beche de mer]] fishermen from the late 1860s saw the first European presence in the area. On the site of the modern-day Cairns foreshore, there was a large native well which was used by these fishermen. A violent confrontation occurred in 1872 between local [[Yidinji people]] and Phillip Garland, a beche de mer fisherman, over the use of this well. The area from this date was subsequently called '''Battle Camp'''.<ref>{{Cite news |date=3 December 1904 |title=SKETCHER. |page=8 |work=[[The Queenslander]] |issue=2021 |location=Queensland, Australia |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article20351698 |access-date=5 September 2018 |via=National Library of Australia |archive-date=1 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210201131932/https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/20351698 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1876, hastened by the need to export gold mined from the [[Hodgkinson Minerals Area|Hodgkinson goldfields]] on the tablelands to the west, closer investigation by several official expeditions established its potential for development into a port. Brinsley G. Sheridan surveyed the area and selected a place further up Trinity Inlet known to the diggers as '''Smith's Landing''' for a settlement which he renamed '''Thornton'''.<ref>{{Cite news |date=28 October 1876 |title=TRINITY BAY. |page=2 |work=[[Mackay Mercury And South Kennedy Advertiser]] |issue=550 |location=Queensland, Australia |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article169858977 |access-date=5 September 2018 |via=National Library of Australia |archive-date=1 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210201131953/https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/169858977 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=9 October 1876 |title=THORNTON. |page=3 |work=[[Telegraph (Brisbane)|The Telegraph]] |issue=1,246 |location=Queensland, Australia |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article174709206 |access-date=5 September 2018 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> However, after [[Native Police]] officers [[Alexander Douglas-Douglas]] and [[Robert Arthur Johnstone]] opened a new track from the goldfields to Battle Camp, this more coastal site became preferable.<ref>{{Cite news |date=25 September 1876 |title=HODGKINSON GOLD-FIELD TO TRINITY BAY. |page=3 |work=[[Telegraph (Brisbane)|The Telegraph]] |issue=1,234 |location=Queensland, Australia |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article174708058 |access-date=5 September 2018 |via=National Library of Australia |archive-date=1 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210201131956/https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/174708058 |url-status=live }}</ref> The area was named Cairns in late 1876 in honour of the then Governor of Queensland, William Cairns.<ref name=":4" /> The site was predominantly [[mangrove]] swamps and sand ridges. Labourers gradually cleared the swamps, and the sand ridges were filled with dried mud, sawdust from local sawmills, and ballast from a quarry at Edge Hill.

Throughout the late 19th century, Cairns prospered from [[Chinese Australians|the settlement of Chinese immigrants]] who helped develop the region's agriculture.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cairns City Chinese heritage trail |url=https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/heritage-register/explorer/trail/?id=cairns-city-chinese-heritage |access-date=2024-03-12 |website=Queensland Heritage Register |publisher=Queensland Government |archive-date=17 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221117160236/https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/heritage-register/explorer/trail/?id=cairns-city-chinese-heritage |url-status=live }}</ref> Soon after Cairns was established "a few entrepreneurial Chinese men began to experiment with crops such as cotton, tobacco, coffee, rice, sugar, and bananas, while market gardeners grew much needed fruit and vegetables.

According to Cathie May, the social structure of the community was divided according to place of origin with storekeepers on the eastern side of Sachs Street predominantly Sze Yap, and Chung Shan storekeepers and merchants on the western side. Nearly all Chinese immigrants to Cairns were from Guangdong Province in the Southern Delta area of China. Most came from Loong Dou, a small distinct district in Chung Shan, with a smaller group from Sze Yap or the "Four Districts" in Toishan. Some also came from Sam Yap or "Three Districts."

"Australian Born Chinese showed little interest in maintaining the Chinese enclave. Many were westernised having at least one European parent or grandparent, or had themselves grown up assimilated into the broader Cairns community through their experiences at school. Neither cultural tastes, nor race relations, provided an incentive for Australian born Chinese to remain living in Chinatown. The barriers causing racial residential segregation were removed and many families lived outside Chinatown."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Robb |first1=Sandi |title=Cairns Chinatown: a heritage study A history of the Cairns Chinese community |date=2012 |publisher=Cairns & District Chinese Association Inc |page=87}}</ref>

Debris from the construction of a railway to [[Herberton, Queensland|Herberton]] on the Atherton Tableland, a project which started in 1886, was also used. The railway opened up land later used for agriculture on the lowlands (sugar cane, corn, rice, bananas, pineapples), and for fruit and dairy production on the Tableland. The success of local agriculture helped establish Cairns as a port, and the creation of a harbour board in 1906 supported its robust economic future.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of Murray & Lyons Solicitors – Cairns Legal Practice |url=http://www.murraylyons.com.au/history |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227205123/http://www.murraylyons.com.au/history |archive-date=27 February 2015 |access-date=5 May 2015 |website=www.murraylyons.com.au |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Ports North – Cairns Cruise Liner Terminal – History |url=http://www.cairnscruiselinerterminal.com.au/History |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518080643/http://www.cairnscruiselinerterminal.com.au/History |archive-date=18 May 2015 |access-date=5 May 2015 |website=www.cairnscruiselinerterminal.com.au |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Urban layout===
[[File:Esplanade, Cairns, 2015 (01).JPG|thumb|left|City centre of Cairns]]

Cairns is a provincial city, with a linear urban layout that runs from the south at Edmonton to the north at [[Ellis Beach]]. The city is approximately {{convert|52|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from north to south; it has experienced a recent [[urban sprawl]], with suburbs occupying land once used for sugar cane farming.

The ''Northern Beaches'' consist of a number of beach communities extending north along the coast. In general, each beach suburb is at the end of a spur road extending from the [[Captain Cook Highway]]. From south to north, these are [[Machans Beach, Queensland|Machans Beach]], [[Holloways Beach, Queensland|Holloways Beach]], [[Yorkeys Knob, Queensland|Yorkeys Knob]], [[Trinity Park, Queensland|Trinity Park]], [[Trinity Beach, Queensland|Trinity Beach]], [[Kewarra Beach, Queensland|Kewarra Beach]], [[Clifton Beach, Queensland|Clifton Beach]], [[Palm Cove, Queensland|Palm Cove]], and [[Ellis Beach, Queensland|Ellis Beach]].

The suburb of [[Smithfield, Queensland|Smithfield]] is inland against the mountains of the Great Dividing Range, between Yorkeys Knob and Trinity Park. It serves as the main hub for the Northern Beaches, with a modern shopping arcade, called Smithfield Shopping Centre.

South of Smithfield and inland from the Northern Beaches along the edge of the Barron River [[flood plain]] are the suburbs of [[Caravonica, Queensland|Caravonica]], [[Kamerunga, Queensland|Kamerunga]], [[Freshwater, Queensland|Freshwater]], and [[Stratford, Queensland|Stratford]]. This area is sometimes referred to as Freshwater Valley, though it is actually the lower part of Redlynch Valley; further up the valley are the suburbs of [[Redlynch, Queensland|Redlynch]], on the western side of Redlynch Valley, and [[Brinsmead, Queensland|Brinsmead]] on the eastern side. Stratford, Freshwater, and Brinsmead are separated from Cairns city by Mount Whitfield (elevation {{convert|365|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}) and Whitfield Range. [[Crystal Cascades]] and [[Copperlode Falls Dam]] are also behind this range. ([[Kuranda, Queensland|Kuranda]], a town on the Barron River on the western side of the Macalister Range, forms part of the Cairns economic catchment but is in the [[Tablelands Region|Tablelands local government]] area and is not part of the Cairns urban area.)

The [[Cairns CBD|city centre of Cairns]] is adjacent to the suburbs of [[Cairns North]], and [[Parramatta Park, Queensland|Parramatta Park]], [[Bungalow, Queensland|Bungalow]], [[Portsmith]], and close to [[Westcourt, Queensland|Westcourt]], [[Manunda, Queensland|Manunda]], [[Manoora, Queensland|Manoora]], [[Edge Hill, Queensland|Edge Hill]], [[Whitfield, Queensland|Whitfield]], [[Kanimbla, Queensland|Kanimbla]], City View, [[Mooroobool, Queensland|Mooroobool]], [[Earlville, Queensland|Earlville]], [[Woree, Queensland|Woree]] and [[Bayview Heights, Queensland|Bayview Heights]]. The small suburb of [[Aeroglen, Queensland|Aeroglen]] is pressed between Mount Whitfield and the airport, on the Captain Cook Highway between [[Cairns North, Queensland|Cairns North]] and Stratford.

''Southside Cairns'', situated in a narrow area between [[Trinity Inlet]] to the east and Lamb Range to the west, includes the suburbs of [[White Rock, Queensland (Cairns Region)|White Rock]], [[Mount Sheridan, Queensland|Mount Sheridan]], [[Bentley Park, Queensland|Bentley Park]] and [[Edmonton, Queensland|Edmonton]]. The townships of [[Goldsborough, Queensland|Goldsborough]], [[Little Mulgrave, Queensland|Little Mulgrave]], and [[Aloomba, Queensland|Aloomba]] are near [[Gordonvale, Queensland|Gordonvale]], on the Mulgrave River. This area is serviced by the [[Bruce Highway]]. Several other small towns and communities within Cairns's jurisdiction are sparsely located along the Bruce Highway, the furthest being [[Bramston Beach, Queensland|Bramston Beach]], {{Convert|81|km|abbr=on}} south of the [[Cairns CBD]]; the largest of these townships is [[Babinda]], about {{Convert|60|km|abbr=on}} from the city.

Cairns is part of the [[Cairns Region]] [[local government areas of Queensland|local government area]] which is governed by a Regional Council. The Council consists of a directly elected mayor and 9 councillors, elected from 9 single-member divisions (or wards) using an optional [[Ranked voting systems|preferential voting]] system. Elections are held every four years.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Queensland |first=Electoral Commission of |date=2024-03-20 |title=Election events |url=https://www.ecq.qld.gov.au/elections/election-events |access-date=2024-05-02 |website=www.ecq.qld.gov.au |language=en |archive-date=7 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240407085957/https://www.ecq.qld.gov.au/elections/election-events |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Cairns Region consists of three former local government areas. The first was the original [[City of Cairns]], consisting of the Cairns City region as listed above. The second, which was amalgamated in 1995, was the [[Shire of Mulgrave (Queensland)|Shire of Mulgrave]] (comprising the other areas, namely the Northern Beaches, Redlynch Valley and Southside). The town of Gordonvale was once called Nelson. The third area is the [[Shire of Douglas]], which amalgamated in 2008 during major statewide local government reforms and then de-amalgamated in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Council |first=Cairns Regional |date=2022-04-01 |title=Council history |url=https://www.cairns.qld.gov.au/experience-cairns/facts-figures-history/history/council-history |access-date=2024-05-02 |website=Cairns Regional Council |language=en-AU |archive-date=2 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240502120948/https://www.cairns.qld.gov.au/experience-cairns/facts-figures-history/history/council-history |url-status=live }}</ref>

At the time of the 1995 amalgamation, Cairns City had a population of approximately 40,000 and Mulgrave Shire had a population of approximately 60,000. Both local government authorities had chambers in the Cairns [[Central business district|CBD]]. The old Cairns City Council chambers has been converted into a new city library. In a controversial decision,<ref>{{Cite news |date=19 July 2001 |title=Land Row |page=1 |work=The Cairns Post |agency=News Limited}}</ref> new Council chambers were constructed on previously contaminated land in the mainly industrial suburb of Portsmith.

Cairns has three representatives in the [[Queensland Parliament]], from the electoral districts of [[Electoral district of Barron River|Barron River]], [[Electoral district of Cairns|Cairns]] and [[Electoral district of Mulgrave (Queensland)|Mulgrave]]. The city is represented in the [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]] by representatives elected from the districts of [[Division of Leichhardt|Leichhardt]] and [[Division of Kennedy|Kennedy]].

Cairns serves as the major commercial centre for the Far North Queensland and Cape York Peninsula Regions. It is a base for the regional offices of various government departments.

===Tourism===
Tourism plays a major part in the Cairns [[Economic system|economy]]. According to [[Tourism Australia]], the Cairns region is the fourth-most-popular destination for international tourists in Australia after Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.<ref>{{Cite web |title=International Market Tourism Facts |url=http://www.tourismaustralia.com/content/Research/Factsheets/TopTen_Regions_Dec2006.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080307161815/http://www.tourismaustralia.com/content/Research/Factsheets/TopTen_Regions_Dec2006.pdf |archive-date=7 March 2008 |publisher=Tourism Australia}}</ref> While the city does not rank amongst Australia's top 10 destinations for domestic tourism, it attracts a significant number of Australian holiday makers despite its distance from major capitals.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Research & Stats |url=http://www.tourism.australia.com/Research.asp?lang=EN&sub=0361 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014171037/http://www.tourism.australia.com/Research.asp?lang=EN&sub=0361 |archive-date=14 October 2006 |publisher=Tourism Australia}}</ref> There is also a growing interest in Cairns from the Chinese leisure market with regular scheduled direct flights from Chinese cities such as Shanghai and Guangzhou.

The city is near the [[Great Barrier Reef]], the [[Wet Tropics of Queensland]], and the [[Atherton Tableland]]. Great Barrier Reef tours that operate from Cairns are very popular and hence Cairns is also considered as the gateway to Great Barrier Reef.<!--Activities in the region include white-water rafting, cruises to the Great Barrier Reef, rainforest coach tours, scenic flights. Various parks and attractions take advantage of the city's natural surroundings, including [[Rainforestation Nature Park]], [[Tjapukai]] Aboriginal Cultural Park, and Kuranda [[Skyrail Rainforest Cableway]], which extends for {{convert|7.5|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} over [[Wet Tropics of Queensland|World Heritage rainforest]]. [require sources indicating notability]-->

The Cairns [[esplanade]] includes a swimming lagoon with adjoining barbecue areas. Cairns Esplanade Lagoon opened in March 2003.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Cairns Esplanade Lagoon remains a tourist magnet in Far North Queensland city, 20 years after it was built |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-03-29/cairns-esplanade-lagoon-20-year-anniversary-tourist-attraction/102159016 |access-date=30 March 2023 |newspaper=ABC News |date=29 March 2023 |archive-date=29 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230329204313/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-03-29/cairns-esplanade-lagoon-20-year-anniversary-tourist-attraction/102159016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Though initially controversial, the 4800-square-metre pool has proved a very popular local attraction since its opening.

===Commercial===
Several shopping centres of various sizes are located throughout Cairns. The largest of these are [[Cairns Central]] shopping centre, located in the central business district (CBD), and Stockland Cairns, located in the suburb of Earlville. In Westcourt, one of the city's oldest shopping centres has been refurbished, with the city's first [[Direct Factory Outlets|DFO]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Direct Factory Outlets |url=http://www.dfo.com.au/cairns/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101005345/http://www.dfo.com.au/cairns/ |archive-date=1 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=3 December 2008 |title=Direct Benefit |work=The Cairns Post |agency=News Limited |url=http://www.cairns.com.au/article/2008/12/03/18345_print-version.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024043732/http://www.cairns.com.au/article/2008/12/03/18345_print-version.html |archive-date=24 October 2009}}</ref> To service the needs of suburbs further from the city centre, shopping complexes are also located at Mount Sheridan, Redlynch, Smithfield, and Clifton Beach.

===Media===
[[File:Cairns Post - Premises 2016 (2).jpg|thumb|Premises of ''The Cairns Post'' on Abbott Street (2016)]]
''[[The Cairns Post]]'', published by [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corp Australia|News Corp.]] is the main daily newspaper published in the city. Widely available are also ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'', a daily newspaper published in Brisbane, and the national [[broadsheet]] ''[[The Australian]]'', which both are also published by News Corp.

Cairns is served by five television stations, three commercial television stations ([[WIN Television]], [[STQ|Seven Queensland]] and [[10 (Southern Cross Austereo)|Southern Cross 10]]) which are regional affiliates of the [[Television broadcasting in Australia|three Australian commercial television]] networks ([[Network 10|10]], [[Seven Network|Seven]] and [[Nine Network|Nine]]), and public broadcasters the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] and [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]<ref>[http://www.digitalready.gov.au/media/DigitalTVTimetable_by_Region.pdf Regional digital TV timetable] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216193549/http://www.digitalready.gov.au/media/DigitalTVTimetable_by_Region.pdf |date=16 December 2010 }}, Australian Government</ref> services.

All three main commercial networks produce local news coverage – [[STQ#News|Seven Queensland]] and [[WIN News#Queensland|WIN Television]] both air 30-minute local news bulletins at 6pm each weeknight, produced from newsrooms in the city but broadcast from studios in [[Maroochydore]] and [[Wollongong]] respectively. Southern Cross 10 airs a regional Queensland news updates of ''[[10 News First]]''.

Cairns radio stations include a number of public, commercial and community broadcasters. The ABC broadcasts [[ABC Far North]], [[Radio National|ABC Radio National]], [[ABC NewsRadio]], [[ABC Classic|ABC Classic FM]] and the [[Triple J]] youth network. Commercial radio stations include [[Star 102.7]], 4CA 846 AM, [[Hot FM (Australian radio network)|Hot FM]] (now [[Hit Network]]), [[Sea FM]] (now [[Triple M]]) and 104.3 [[RadioTAB|4TAB]] sports radio, while the community radio stations are 4CCR-FM (Cairns FM 89.1), 101.9 Coast FM, [[Vision Christian Radio]], Orbit FM 88.0FM & 87.8FM and 4CIM 98.7FM (Bumma Bippera Media).

=== Industry and agriculture ===
The land around Cairns is still used for [[sugar cane]] farming, although this land is increasingly under pressure from new suburbs as the city grows. The [[Mulgrave Sugar Mill]] is located in Gordonvale ({{coord|-17.0929|145.7889|type:landmark_region:AU-QLD|name=Mulgrave Sugar Mill}}).<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |title=Msf Sugar |url=http://www.msfsugar.com.au/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120222436/http://www.msfsugar.com.au/ |archive-date=2015-11-20 |access-date=2015-10-27 |website=www.msfsugar.com.au}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Mulgrave Mill {{!}} Msf Sugar |url=http://www.msfsugar.com.au/our-mills/mulgrave-mill/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121212201/http://www.msfsugar.com.au/our-mills/mulgrave-mill/ |archive-date=2015-11-21 |access-date=2015-10-27 |website=www.msfsugar.com.au}}</ref>

The [[Barron Gorge Hydroelectric Power Station]] is located nearby on the lower [[Barron River (Queensland)|Barron River]], and provides [[green power]].

==Transport==
Cairns is an important transport hub in the Far North Queensland region. Located at the base of Cape York Peninsula, it provides important transport links between the Peninsula and [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] regions, and the areas to the south of the state. [[Cairns International Airport]] is essential to the viability of the area's tourism industry.

===Roads===
[[File:forestgardens.png|thumb|right|The [[Bruce Highway]] in Cairns southern suburbs at morning [[peak hour]].]]

The [[Bruce Highway]] runs for {{convert|1700|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from [[Bald Hills, Queensland|Bald Hills]] on the [[City of Brisbane|City of Brisbane's]] northern boundary, and terminates in [[Woree, Queensland|Woree]], a southern suburb in Cairns. The [[Captain Cook Highway]] (also referred as the Cook Highway) commences at [[Aeroglen, Queensland|Aeroglen]], a northern suburb of Cairns, and runs for approximately {{convert|76|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} northwest to [[Mossman, Queensland|Mossman]].<ref>{{Queensland Globe|access-date=9 December 2017}}</ref>

A need for future upgrades to the Bruce Highway to motorway standards through the southern suburbs to Gordonvale has been identified in regional planning strategies to cope with increasing congestion from rapid population growth. This will result in overpasses at all major intersections from Woree to Gordonvale. The motorway will divert from Bentley Park to Gordonvale, bypassing Edmonton to reduce the effects of road noise on residential areas.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=February 2000 |author=Far North Queensland Regional Planning Advisory Committee |journal=Far North Queensland Regional Plan |title=FNQ Regional Plan – Supporting Technical Documents – Integrated Transport |pages=41–43 |isbn=0724297480}}</ref>

The [[Kennedy Highway]] commences at Smithfield on the Barron River flood plain north of Cairns, and ascends the Macalister Range to the township of Kuranda. The highway then extends to the town of [[Mareeba]] on the [[Atherton Tableland]], and continues to communities of Cape York Peninsula.

The [[Gillies Highway]] commences at the township of Gordonvale, and ascends the [[Gillies Range]] (part of the Great Dividing Range) to the town of [[Atherton, Queensland|Atherton]] on the Atherton Tableland, passing through the township of [[Yungaburra, Queensland|Yungaburra]] on the way.

The controversial private road, [[Quaid Road]], was constructed in 1989 through what is now a [[Wet Tropics]] [[World Heritage|World Heritage Area]], and links [[Wangetti, Queensland|Wangetti]], on the coast just north of Cairns, to [[Southedge]], just south of [[Mount Molloy, Queensland|Mount Molloy]]. The road is not open to the public and is not used for general traffic.

===Bus===
A public bus transit network exists within the city, with two transit hubs located within the [[Central business district|CBD]]: the [[Cairns Central]] Railway Station precinct, and the Cairns City Bus Station located within the Lake street and Shield street area, through which all bus lines operate and provide linkage to taxi, ride share and intercity rail services.<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 2016 |title=Keeping Our CBD Inviting (factsheet) |url=http://www.cairns.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/88636/Keeping-our-CBD-inviting.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024100035/http://www.cairns.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/88636/Keeping-our-CBD-inviting.pdf |archive-date=24 October 2017 |access-date=24 October 2017}}</ref> The transit network includes most parts of the city, from [[Palm Cove, Queensland|Palm Cove]] in the north, [[Gordonvale, Queensland|Gordonvale]] in the south and [[Redlynch, Queensland|Redlynch]] to the west. It is managed throughout the city by [[TransLink (South East Queensland)|Translink]]: through a service contract with the [[Kinetic Group#Queensland|Kinetic Group]] company, however the [[Go card|Go Card]] ticketing system has not been implemented in the region. A smaller [[shuttle bus]] service, ''Jon's Kuranda Bus'' runs between Cairns and Kuranda alongside other private coach services. The main bus hubs in the Cairns CBD are the Cairns City bus station, opened in 2014,<ref>{{Cite news |last=Bateman |first=Daniel |date=7 July 2014 |title=Cairns Sunbus drivers don't want to leave temporary Esplanade terminal |work=Cairns Post |publisher=News Corp Australia |url=https://www.cairnspost.com.au/news/cairns/cairns-sunbus-drivers-dont-want-to-leave-temporary-esplanade-terminal/news-story/1208a7627dbee9b315558435b5b23d72 |access-date=24 October 2020}}</ref> and at [[Cairns Central]], the former servicing almost all bus lines in Cairns.<ref>{{Cite map |last1=Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads |title=Cairns bus network map |url=https://translink.com.au/sites/default/files/assets/resources/plan-your-journey/maps/200224-cairns-network-map.pdf |access-date=21 October 2020 |work=TransLink |publisher=Queensland Government |date=24 February 2020 |archive-date=18 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201018181732/https://translink.com.au/sites/default/files/assets/resources/plan-your-journey/maps/200224-cairns-network-map.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

Cairns is served by long-distance coaches to Brisbane, and regional cities to the south. Coaches also operate west to [[Mount Isa]] via [[Townsville]], and to [[Alice Springs]] and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] in the [[Northern Territory]].

===Rail===
[[File:StateLibQld 1 100880.jpg|thumb|right|Railway workers on the Cairns Railway with a view of Glacier Rock in the background, {{c.|1891}}.<ref>The Cairns Range Railway was built to connect the mining centre of Herberton with Cairns. Work began on 10 May 1886; the first sod was turned in Cairns by Samuel Griffith, Premier of Queensland, and the first train arrived in Herberton on 20 October 1910 (Information taken from: A.D. Broughton, A pictorial history of the construction of the Cairns Range Railway, 1886–1891, 1991).</ref>]]

[[Cairns railway station]] is the terminus for Queensland's [[North Coast railway line, Queensland|North Coast railway line]], which follows the eastern seaboard from Brisbane. Services are operated by [[Queensland Rail]] (QR) and include the high-speed [[Diesel Tilt Train]]. Freight trains also operate along the route, with a QR Freight handling facility located at Portsmith.

Pacific National Queensland (a division of [[Pacific National]], owned by [[Asciano Limited]]) operates a rail siding at Woree. It runs private trains on the rail network owned by the Queensland State Government and managed by QR's Network Division.

The [[Kuranda Scenic Railway]] operates from Cairns. The tourist railway ascends the Macalister Range and is not used for commuter services. It passes through the suburbs of Stratford, Freshwater (stopping at Freshwater Station) and Redlynch before reaching Kuranda.

Freight services to [[Forsayth, Queensland|Forsayth]] were discontinued in the mid-1990s. These were mixed freight and passenger services that served the semi-remote towns west of the Great Dividing Range. There is now a weekly passenger-only service, ''The [[Savannahlander]]'', that leaves Cairns on Wednesday mornings. The Savannahlander is run by a private company, Cairns Kuranda Steam Trains.

Cairns is served by a [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] cane railway (or cane train) network that hauls harvested sugar cane to the [[Mulgrave Sugar Mill]] located in Gordonvale. The pressure of urban sprawl on land previously cultivated by cane farmers has seen this network reduced over recent years.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cairns Transport Network: Concept Design Report |url=https://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/-/media/Projects/C/Cairns-Transit-Network/Alignment-Plans/Concept-Design-Report/chapter05_land_use_planning_and_urban_design.pdf?la=en |access-date=17 March 2020 |website=Department of Transport & Main Roads |publisher=[[Queensland Government]] |page=5.42 |archive-date=16 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516124645/http://tmr.qld.gov.au/-/media/Projects/C/Cairns-Transit-Network/Alignment-Plans/Concept-Design-Report/chapter05_land_use_planning_and_urban_design.pdf?la=en |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Airport===
[[File:Cairns Airport.JPG|right|thumb|[[Cairns International Airport]]]]

[[Cairns International Airport]] is {{convert|7|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} north of Cairns City between the CBD and the Northern Beaches. The domestic terminal at Cairns Airport underwent an extensive redevelopment which began in 2007 and was completed in 2010. In 2023, a new renovation began on the international terminal, which was expected to cost between [[A$]]40 and 50 million.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

The airport has a domestic terminal, an international terminal, and a general aviation area. The airport handles international flights, and flights to major Australian cities, tourist destinations, and regional destinations throughout North Queensland. It is an important base for general aviation serving the Cape York Peninsula and Gulf of Carpentaria communities. The Cairns airport is also a base for the [[Royal Flying Doctor Service]].

===Port===
[[File:Cairns-marina.JPG|thumb|Cairns Marina]]
The Cairns Seaport, located on Trinity Inlet, is operated by the Cairns Port Authority.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cairns Port Authority |url=http://www.cairnsport.com.au/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050701074245/http://www.cairnsport.com.au/ |archive-date=1 July 2005}}</ref>
It serves as an important port for tourist operators providing daily reef trips. These consist of large [[catamarans]] capable of carrying over 300 passengers, as well as smaller operators that may take as few as 12 tourists. Cairns Port is also a port of call for [[cruise ships]], such as Captain Cook Cruises, cruising the South Pacific Ocean. It also provides freight services to coastal townships on Cape York Peninsula, the [[Torres Strait]] and the Gulf of Carpentaria.

Yearly cargo through the port totals 1.13&nbsp;million tonnes. Almost 90% of the trade is bulk cargoes<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Cite web |title=Cairns Port Authority 2005/6 Annual Report |url=http://www.cairnsport.com.au/content/standard.asp?name=MC_Annual_Reports |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121230103839/http://www.cairnsport.com.au/content/standard.asp?name=MC_Annual_Reports |archive-date=30 December 2012}}</ref> – including petroleum, sugar, molasses, fertiliser and LP gas.

[[Yumplatok]]  (also known as Torres Strait Creole and Broken) is a contemporary [[Torres Strait Island languages|Torres Strait Island language]] originating in the [[Torres Strait]].

Torres Strait Creole is spoken by most Torres Strait Islanders and is a mixture of [[Standard Australian English]] and traditional languages. It is an English-based creole; however, each island has its own version of creole. Torres Strait Creole is also spoken on the [[Australian mainland]], including [[Northern Peninsula Area Region]] and coastal communities such as Cairns, [[Townsville]], [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]], [[Rockhampton]] and [[Brisbane]].<ref name=langmap/>
