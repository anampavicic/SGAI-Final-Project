==History==
[[File:THE KIRYAT AVODA SUBURB OF HOLON. הפרוור קרית עבודה בחולון.D27-090.jpg|thumb|Kiryat Avoda, Holon, 1938]]

Holon was founded in 1935 on sand dunes six kilometers ({{convert|6|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) from Tel Aviv.<ref name="autogenerated1">''The Guide to Israel'', Zeev Vilnay, Hamakor Press, Jerusalem, 1972, p.239</ref> The Łódzia textile factory was established there by Jewish immigrants from [[Łódź]], Poland, along with many other industrial enterprises.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> In February 1936, the cornerstone was laid for Kiryat Avoda, a Modernist building complex designed by architect [[Joseph Neufeld]] to solve the shortage of housing for municipal workers.<ref>[https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/1.5155247 Back to the future, The tree is still standing]</ref>
[[File:Location holon.png|thumb|left|100px|Location of Holon in the [[Tel Aviv District]]]]
In the early months of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], Holon was on the front line, with constant shooting taking place on the border with the village of [[Tel A-Rish]] to its northwest—a suburb of Arab [[Jaffa]]—and clashes also in the direction of the town of [[Yazur]] to the east. An attack by the Holon-based [[Haganah]] militia units on [[Operation Hametz|Tel A-Rish]] was repulsed with considerable losses. 

After the establishment of the state, Holon expanded to include Tel A-Rish (renamed ''Tel Giborim'', "The Mound of the Heroes") and the orange groves of [[Yazur]].

In February 2001, a [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] [[2001 Azor attack|attack at a crowded bus stop in Holon]] killed eight Israelis and injured twenty-five.<ref name="mfa.gov.il">{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Palestinian+terror+since+2000/Victims+of+Palestinian+Violence+and+Terrorism+sinc.htm |title=Victims of Palestinian Violence and Terrorism since September 2000 |publisher=Mfa.gov.il |access-date=April 25, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403024612/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-%20Obstacle%20to%20Peace/Palestinian%20terror%20since%202000/Victims%20of%20Palestinian%20Violence%20and%20Terrorism%20sinc.htm |archive-date=April 3, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The image of Holon as a working-class dormitory community has changed over the years.
