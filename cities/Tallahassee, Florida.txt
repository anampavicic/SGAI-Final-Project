'''Tallahassee''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|t|æ|l|ə|ˈ|h|æ|s|i}} {{respell|TAL|ə|HASS|ee}}) is the [[List of capitals in the United States|capital city]] of the U.S. state of [[Florida]]. It is the [[county seat]] of and the only incorporated municipality in [[Leon County, Florida|Leon County]]. Tallahassee became the capital of Florida, then the [[Florida Territory]], in 1824. In 2022, the estimated population was 201,731,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tallahassee city, Florida |url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/tallahasseecityflorida |access-date=April 15, 2022 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]}}</ref> making it the [[List of municipalities in Florida|eighth-most populous city in the state of Florida]].<ref name="PopEstBigCities">{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov |title=Table 1: 2010 Municipality Population |format=[[comma-separated values|CSV]] |work=2010 Population |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division |date=March 24, 2010 |access-date=July 1, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103190745/http://www.census.gov/ |archive-date=January 3, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> It is the principal city of the [[Tallahassee, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which had an estimated population of 390,992 {{as of|2022|lc=y}}. Tallahassee is the largest city in the [[Big Bend (Florida)|Florida Big Bend]] and [[Florida Panhandle]] regions.

With a student population exceeding 70,000, Tallahassee is a [[college town]], home to [[Florida State University]], [[Florida A&M University]], and [[Tallahassee State College]] (a large [[Florida College System|state college]] that serves mainly as a feeder school to FSU and FAMU).<ref>{{cite web |title=Team, News, Projects {{!}} Tallahassee Investor Relations {{!}} BondLink |url=https://www.tallahasseebonds.com/tallahassee-bond-investors-fl/about/i478 |access-date=June 15, 2020 |website=www.tallahasseebonds.com}}</ref>

As the capital, Tallahassee is the site of the [[Florida State Capitol]], [[Supreme Court of Florida]], [[Florida Governor's Mansion]], and nearly 30 state agency headquarters. The city is also known for its large number of law firms, lobbying organizations, trade associations and professional associations, including [[The Florida Bar]] and the [[Florida Chamber of Commerce]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flchamber.com/ |title=Florida Chamber of Commerce &#124; Home Page |publisher=Flchamber.com |access-date=August 2, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140804012309/http://www.flchamber.com/ |archive-date=August 4, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> It is a recognized regional center for scientific research, and home to the [[National High Magnetic Field Laboratory]]. In 2015, Tallahassee was awarded the [[All-America City Award]] by the [[National Civic League]] for the second time.

==History==
{{Main|History of Tallahassee, Florida|Timeline of Tallahassee, Florida}}
[[File:Mission San Luis.jpg|thumb|The [[Mission San Luis de Apalachee]] as it may have appeared in the 17th century]]
Indigenous peoples occupied this area for thousands of years before European encounter. Around 1200&nbsp;CE, the large and complex [[Mississippian culture]] had built earthwork mounds near Lake Jackson which survive today; they are preserved in the [[Lake Jackson Mounds Archaeological State Park|Lake Jackson Archaeological State Park]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tallahasseenewsroom.com/MediaKit/Trivia/ |title=tallahasseenewsroom.com |access-date=August 2, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712020703/http://www.tallahasseenewsroom.com/MediaKit/Trivia/ |archive-date=July 12, 2014}}</ref>

The [[Spanish Empire]] established their first colonial settlement at [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]]. During the 17th century they established several missions in [[Apalachee Province|Apalachee territory]] to procure food and labor to support their settlement, as well as to convert the natives to [[Roman Catholicism]]. The largest, [[Mission San Luis de Apalachee]] in Tallahassee, has been partially reconstructed by the state of Florida.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Reconstructing Mission San Luis |url=https://www.missionsanluis.org/learn/reconstructing-msl/ |access-date=November 16, 2023 |website=Mission San Luis - Florida Department of State |archive-date=November 16, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231116204701/https://www.missionsanluis.org/learn/reconstructing-msl/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The [[Narváez expedition|expedition]] of [[Pánfilo de Narváez]] encountered the Apalachee people, although it did not reach the site of Tallahassee. [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]] and his mid-16th-century expedition occupied the Apalachee town of [[Anhaica]] (at what is now Tallahassee) in the winter of 1538–39. Based on archaeological excavations, this Anhaica site is now known to have been about {{convert|0.5|mi|m|sigfig=1}} east of the present [[Florida State Capitol]]. The De Soto encampment is believed to be the first place that Christmas was celebrated in the continental United States.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hernando de Soto 1539–1540 Winter Encampment at Anhaica Apalachee |url=https://dos.fl.gov/historical/archaeology/projects/hernando-de-soto-1539-1540-winter-encampment-at-anhaica-apalachee/ |access-date=November 16, 2023 |website=Division of Historical Resources - Florida Department of State}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=The First Known Christmas in Florida |url=https://www.floridamemory.com/items/show/342048?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=Tt3a4cO_a2he8tqCZd81fIXqJtyo9IyqPmDkW5vR820-1637270358-0-gaNycGzNCn0 |website=Florida Memory}}</ref>

The name ''Tallahassee'' is a [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean]] language word often translated as "old fields" or "old town".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flheritage.com/facts/reports/names/city3.cfm#T |title=Name Origins of Florida Places |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |publisher=Florida Department of State, Division of Historical Resources |access-date=July 7, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729184751/http://www.flheritage.com/facts/reports/names/city3.cfm#T |archive-date=July 29, 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> It was likely an expression of the [[Creek (people)|Creek]] people who migrated from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Alabama]] to this region in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, under pressure from [[European-American]] encroachment on their territory. They found large areas of cleared land previously occupied by the [[Apalachee]] tribe. (The Creek and later refugees who joined them developed as the [[Seminole (tribe)|Seminole]] Indians of Florida. The [[Talimali Band of Apalachee Indians]] in [[Louisiana]] identify as present-day descendants of the Apalachee Indians.){{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

During the [[First Seminole War]], [[Andrew Jackson|General Andrew Jackson]] fought two separate [[skirmish]]es in and around Tallahassee, which was then Spanish territory. The first battle took place on November 12, 1817. After Chief Neamathla, of the village of Fowltown just west of present-day Tallahassee, refused Jackson's orders to relocate, Jackson entered the village, burnt it to the ground, and drove off its occupants. The Indians retaliated, killing 50 soldiers and civilians. Jackson reentered Florida in March 1818. According to Jackson's adjutant, Colonel Robert Butler, they "advanced on the Indian village called Tallahasse (sic) [where] two of the enemy were made prisoner."<ref>Hare, p.22</ref>

===State capital===
[[File:Cascadespark.jpg|thumb|A hand-colored photograph of [[Cascades Park (Tallahassee)|Cascades Park]] in 1912]]
Florida became an American territory in September 1821, in accordance with the [[Adams-Onís Treaty]] of 1819.

The first session of the [[Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida]] met on July 22, 1822, at Pensacola, the former capital of [[West Florida]]. Members from St. Augustine, the former capital of [[East Florida]], traveled 59 days by water to attend. The second session was in St. Augustine, and western delegates needed 28 days to travel perilously around the peninsula to reach St. Augustine. During this session, delegates decided to hold future meetings at a halfway point. Two appointed commissioners selected Tallahassee, at that point an Apalachee settlement ([[Anhaica]]) virtually abandoned after [[Seminole Wars#East Florida (east side of Apalachicola River)|Andrew Jackson burned it in 1818]], as a halfway point. In 1824, the third legislative session met there in a crude log building serving as the capitol.<ref>''Florida: A Short History,'' Michael V. Gannon, {{ISBN|0-8130-1167-1}}, 1993</ref>

From 1821 through 1845, during Florida's territorial period, the rough-hewn frontier capital gradually developed as a town. The [[Marquis de Lafayette]], French hero of the American Revolution, returned to the United States in 1824 for a tour. The [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] voted to give him $200,000 (the same amount he had given the colonies in 1778), US citizenship, and the [[Lafayette Land Grant]], {{convert|36|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} of land that today includes large portions of Tallahassee. In 1845, a [[Greek revival]] masonry structure was erected as the Capitol building in time for statehood. Now known as the "old Capitol", it stands in front of the high-rise Capitol building built in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cfhf.net/maps/1839.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040620001604/http://www.cfhf.net/maps/1839.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 20, 2004 |title=Mosquito County 1842 |access-date=May 10, 2006}}</ref>

Tallahassee was in the heart of Florida's [[Cotton Belt (region)|Cotton Belt]]—Leon County led the state in cotton production—and was the center of the [[History of slavery|slave trade]] in Florida.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.questia.com/read/259813?title=3%3a%20Slave%20Trading |title=Slavery and Plantation Growth in Antebellum, Florida, 1821–1860 |publisher= |date=July 30, 2012 |access-date=August 2, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812132531/http://www.questia.com/read/259813?title=3%3a%20Slave%20Trading |archive-date=August 12, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> During the [[American Civil War]], Tallahassee was the only Confederate state capital east of the [[Mississippi River]] not captured by Union forces, and the only one not burned. A small engagement, the [[Battle of Natural Bridge]], was fought south of the city on March 6, 1865, just a month before the war ended.

[[File:First reenactment of the Battle of Natural Bridge of 1865 in 1975.jpg|thumb|A reenactment of the 1865 [[Battle of Natural Bridge]]]]
During the 19th century, the institutions that would develop into what is now [[Florida State University]] were established in Tallahassee; it became a university town. These included the [[Tallahassee Female Academy]] (founded 1843) and the Florida Institute (founded 1854). In 1851, the Florida legislature decreed two seminaries to be built on either side of the [[Suwannee River]], [[East Florida Seminary]] and [[West Florida Seminary]]. In 1855, West Florida Seminary was transferred to the Florida Institute building (which had been established as an inducement for the state to place the seminary in Tallahassee). In 1858, the seminary absorbed the Tallahassee Female Academy and became coeducational.<ref name="fshist">{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.fsu.edu/about/history.html |publisher=Office of University Communications, Florida State University |access-date=December 21, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107061306/https://www.fsu.edu/about/history.html |archive-date=January 7, 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Its main building was near the northwest corner of South Copeland and West Jefferson streets, approximately where FSU's [[Westcott Building]] is today.

[[File:HistoricTallahassee.jpg|thumb|Tallahassee in 1885]]
In 1887, the Normal College for Colored Students, the ancestor of today's [[Florida A&M University|FAMU]], opened its doors. The legislature decided Tallahassee was the best location in Florida for a college serving African-American students; the state had segregated schools. Four years later, its name was changed to [[State Normal and Industrial College for Colored Students]], to teach teachers for elementary school children and students in industrial skills.

After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] much of Florida's industry moved to the south and east, a trend that continues today. The end of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and the rise of free labor reduced the profitability of the cotton and tobacco trade, at a time when world markets were also changing. The state's major industries shifted to citrus, lumber, [[naval stores]], cattle ranching, and tourism. The latter was increasingly important by the late 19th century. In the post-Civil War period, many former [[plantation]]s in the Tallahassee area were purchased by wealthy northerners for use as winter hunting preserves. This included the hunting preserve of Henry L. Beadel, who bequeathed his land for the study of the effects of fire on wildlife habitat. Today the preserve is known as the [[Tall Timbers Research Station and Land Conservancy]], nationally recognized for its research into [[fire ecology]] and the use of [[prescribed burning]].

===1900–99===
Until [[World War II]], Tallahassee remained a small Southern town {{citation needed span|date=April 2017|text=with virtually the entire population living within one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) of the Capitol.}} The main economic drivers were the colleges and state government, where politicians met to discuss spending money on grand public improvement projects to accommodate growth in places such as Miami and Tampa Bay, hundreds of miles away from the capital.

Tallahassee was also active in protest during the [[civil rights era]]. The [[Tallahassee bus boycott]] was a citywide boycott in Tallahassee, Florida that sought to end racial segregation in the employment and seating arrangements of city buses. On May 26, 1956, Wilhelmina Jakes and Carrie Patterson, two Florida A&M University students, were arrested by the [[Tallahassee Police Department]] for "placing themselves in a position to incite a riot". Robert Saunders, representing the [[NAACP]], and Rev. [[C. K. Steele]] began talks with city authorities while the local African-American community started boycotting the city's buses. The Inter-Civic Council ended the boycott on December 22, 1956. On January 7, 1957, the City Commission repealed the bus-franchise segregation clause because of the United States Supreme Court ruling ''[[Browder v. Gayle]]'' (1956). In the 1960s, there was a movement to transfer the capital to [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], closer to the state's growing population centers. That movement was defeated; the 1970s saw a long-term commitment by the state to the capital city, with the construction of the new capitol complex and preservation of the old Florida State Capitol building.

In 1970, the Census Bureau reported the city's population as 74.0% white and 25.4% black.<ref>{{cite web |title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 199 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archive-date=August 12, 2012}}</ref> In 1971, the city elected [[James R. Ford]] to the 5-member City Commission, and he became the city's first African-American mayor in 1972 (commissioners rotated into the position serving a one-year term).
 
[[Bobby Bowden]] became the head coach of [[Florida State Seminoles football]] in 1976, and turned Tallahassee into a city dominated by college football, Bowden became very successful very quickly at Florida State. By his second year, Bowden had to deny many rumors that he would leave for another job; the team went 9–2, compared to the four wins total in the three seasons before Bowden. During 34 years as head coach he had only one losing season–his first, in 1976.

In 1977, the 22-story high-rise [[Florida State Capitol|Capitol building]], designed by architect [[Edward Durell Stone]], was completed. Since 2021, it has been the third-tallest state capitol building in the United States. In 1978, the Old Capitol, directly in front of the new Capitol, was scheduled for demolition, but state officials decided to keep it as a museum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flhistoriccapitol.gov/ |title=Florida Historic Capitol Museum |publisher=Flhistoriccapitol.gov |access-date=August 2, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629132433/http://www.flhistoriccapitol.gov/ |archive-date=June 29, 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1986, [[Jack McLean (mayor)|Jack McLean]] served as mayor, the second African-American to hold the position.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Gerald |last=Ensley |title=1982 election last gasp of 'good 'ol boy' system |newspaper=[[Tallahassee Democrat]] |date=September 26, 2015 |url=https://www.tallahassee.com/story/opinion/columnists/ensley/2015/09/26/election-last-gasp-good-ol-boy-system/72893100/}}</ref>

Tallahassee was the center of world attention for six weeks during the [[United States presidential election in Florida, 2000|2000 United States Presidential election recount]], which involved numerous rulings by the [[Florida Secretary of State]] and the [[Florida Supreme Court]].

Tallahassee has an area of {{convert|98.2|sqmi|km2|1}}, of which {{convert|95.7|sqmi|km2|1}} is land and {{convert|2.5|sqmi|km2}}, or 2.59%, is water.<ref name="GR1">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=April 23, 2011 |date=February 12, 2011 |title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>

Tallahassee's terrain is hilly by Florida standards, being at the southern end of the [[Red Hills Region]], just above the [[Cody Scarp]]. The elevation varies from near sea level to just over {{convert|200|ft|m}}, with the state capitol on one of the highest hills in the city. The city includes two large lake basins, [[Lake Jackson (Tallahassee, Florida)|Lake Jackson]] and [[Lake Lafayette]], and borders the northern end of the [[Apalachicola National Forest]].

The flora and fauna are similar to those found in the mid-south and low country regions of [[South Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The palm trees are the more cold-hardy varieties like the state tree, the ''[[Sabal palmetto]]''. Pines, magnolias, hickories, and a variety of oaks are the dominant trees. The [[live oak|Southern Live Oak]] is perhaps the most emblematic of the city.

===Urban planning and expansion===
[[File:Tallahasseeskyline.jpg|thumb|Downtown Tallahassee at night]]
The first plan for the Capitol Center was the 1947 Taylor Plan, which consolidated several government buildings in one downtown area. In 1974, the Capitol Center Planning Commission for the City of Tallahassee, Florida responded to growth of its urban center with a conceptual plan for the expansion of its Capitol Center. [[Hisham Ashkouri]], working for [[The Architects' Collaborative]], led the urban planning and design effort. Estimating growth and related development for approximately the next 25 years, the program projected the need for 2.3&nbsp;million square feet (214,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) of new government facilities in the city core, with 3,500 dwelling units, {{convert|100|acre|ha|sigfig=2}} of new public open space, retail and private office space, and other ancillary spaces. Community participation was an integral part of the design review, welcoming Tallahassee residents to provide input as well as citizens' groups and government agencies, resulting in the creation of six separate design alternatives. {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

===Sprawl and compact growth===
The Tallahassee-Leon County Planning Department implements policies aimed at promoting compact growth and development, including the establishment and maintenance of an Urban Service Area. The intent of the Urban Service Area is to "have Tallahassee and Leon County grow in a responsible manner, with infrastructure provided economically and efficiently, and surrounding forest and agricultural lands protected from unwarranted and premature conversion to urban land use."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talgov.com/Uploads/Public/Documents/planning/pdf/compln/thecompplan/lus.pdf |title=Land Use Element of the Tallahassee-Leon County Comprehensive Plan. |date=January 22, 2016 |website=Talgov.com |access-date=January 11, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114153704/http://talgov.com/Uploads/Public/Documents/planning/pdf/compln/thecompplan/lus.pdf |archive-date=January 14, 2017}}</ref> The result of compact growth policies has been a significant overall reduction in the Sprawl Index for Tallahassee between 2000 and 2010.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Hamidi |first1=Shima |last2=Ewing |first2=Reid |date=August 1, 2014 |title=A longitudinal study of changes in urban sprawl between 2000 and 2010 in the United States |journal=Landscape and Urban Planning |volume=128 |pages=72–82 |doi=10.1016/j.landurbplan.2014.04.021 |bibcode=2014LUrbP.128...72H}}</ref> CityLab reported on this finding, stating "Tallahassee laps the field, at least as far as the Sprawl Index is concerned."<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.citylab.com/housing/2014/06/the-us-cities-that-sprawled-the-most-and-least-between-2000-and-2010/372105/ |title=The U.S. Cities That Sprawled the Most (and Least) Between 2000 and 2010 |newspaper=CityLab |language=en-US |access-date=January 11, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118073636/http://www.citylab.com/housing/2014/06/the-us-cities-that-sprawled-the-most-and-least-between-2000-and-2010/372105/ |archive-date=January 18, 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:AutumnColors.JPG|thumb|Tallahassee experiences four seasons. Shown here are the autumn leaves along the sidewalks of Monroe Street in Downtown Tallahassee.]]
Tallahassee has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), with long, tropical summers and short, mild winters, as well as warm to hot, drier springs and autumns.  Tallahassee falls in [[USDA]] [[hardiness zones]] 8b (15&nbsp;°F to 20&nbsp;°F). Summer maximum temperatures <!--not necessarily higher by daily mean--> are hotter than locations to the south on the Florida peninsula and it is one of the few cities in the state to occasionally record temperatures above {{convert|100|°F|1|disp=or}}; there are an average of 11.2 days per year that have temperatures at least that high.<ref name=NOAA2>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/services/data/v1?dataset=normals-monthly-1991-2020&stations=USC00088756&format=pdf&dataTypes=MLY-TMAX-NORMAL,MLY-TMIN-NORMAL,MLY-TAVG-NORMAL,MLY-PRCP-NORMAL,MLY-SNOW-NORMAL |title=NOAA NCEI U.S. Climate Normals Quick Access |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |access-date=January 25, 2023}}</ref> The record high of {{convert|105|°F|0}} was set on June 15, 2011.<ref>{{cite web |title=NOAA Weather Records Tallahassee |url=http://www.weather.gov/climate/getclimate.php?wfo=tae |publisher=NOAA |access-date=June 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929081457/http://www.weather.gov/climate/getclimate.php?wfo=tae |archive-date=September 29, 2006}}</ref>

Summer is characterized by brief intense [[rain|showers]] and [[thunderstorms]] that form along the afternoon [[sea breeze]] from the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. The daily mean temperature in July, the hottest month, is {{convert|82.9|°F|1}}. Conversely, the winter is markedly cooler, with a January daily average temperature of {{convert|51.0|°F|1}}.<ref name= NOAA/> There is an average of 34.6 nights with a minimum at or below freezing, and on average, the window for freezing temperatures is from November 22 thru March 16, allowing a growing season of 250&nbsp;days.<ref name= NOAA/> With the data from the 1991&ndash;2020 normals, Tallahassee is in USDA zone 9a by a small margin, the coldest temperature of the year usually being about {{convert|20.2|°F|1}}. Temperature readings below {{convert|15|°F|0}} are very rare, having last occurred on January 11, 2010.<ref name= NOAA/>

During the [[Great Blizzard of 1899]] the city reached {{convert|−2|°F|0}} on February 13, which remains Florida's only recorded subzero reading. The record cold daily maximum is {{convert|22|°F|0}}, set on the same day as the all-time record low. More recently, a {{convert|28|F|C}} daily maximum was recorded in 1985.<ref name = NOAA/> Conversely, the record warm daily minimum is {{convert|81|°F|0}} on July 15, 1980.<ref name= NOAA/>
However, the city itself is considerably warmer than the airport where the National Weather Service records its data from, even though the National Weather Service does not record data from it. This is due to an [[urban heat island]], which creates an average disparity of 5.8&nbsp;°F (3.2&nbsp;°C) and is especially pronounced during winter.<ref name="theurban">Scripps Media, Inc (December 6, 2014). {{cite web |url=https://www.wtxl.com/weather/the-urban-heat-island-phenomenon/article_d4b682ae-7dbc-11e4-b49e-57bd8d0e597e.html |title=The "Urban Heat Island" Phenomenon |work=[[WTXL]] |date=December 7, 2014 |access-date=June 11, 2022}}</ref><ref name="explainerthe">Roop, Charles (July 19, 2021). {{cite web |url=https://www.wctv.tv/2021/07/20/explainer-urban-heat-island-effect/ |title=Explainer: the urban heat island effect |work=[[WCTV]] |date=July 20, 2021 |access-date=August 16, 2022}}</ref><ref name="frostand">National Weather Service. {{cite web |url=https://www.weather.gov/tae/frost_and_freeze_info |title=Frost and Freeze Information for the NWS Tallahassee Area |work=[[NOAA]] |access-date=August 16, 2022}}</ref>

Snow and ice are rare in Tallahassee, not occurring during most winters. Historically, snow flurries are recorded every three to four years, but measurable snowfall of {{convert|0.1|in|cm|1}} or more has only happened once in the 1991–2020 time period.  Tallahassee has recorded a few very small accumulating snowfalls over the last 100 years; the greatest amount was {{convert|2.8|in|cm|0}} on February 13, 1958.<ref name="chanceof">Etters, Karl (February 7, 2016).

Although several [[hurricane]]s have brushed Tallahassee with their outer rain and wind bands, in recent years only [[Hurricane Kate (1985)|Hurricane Kate]], in 1985, and [[Hurricane Hermine]], in 2016, have struck Tallahassee directly. [[Hurricane Michael]] passed {{Convert|50|mi}} to the west after making landfall near [[Mexico Beach, Florida]] in October 2018 as a Category 5 storm, resulting in 95% of [[Leon County, Florida|Leon County]] being without power.

The Big Bend area of North Florida sees several [[tornado]]es each year during the season, but they are generally weak, cause little structural damage, and rarely hit the city. On April 19, 2015, a tornado touched down in Tallahassee. The tornado was rated [[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF1]], and created a path as wide as {{convert|350|yards|m|0}} for almost {{convert|5|miles|km|0}} near Maclay Gardens.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Confirmed-Tornado-Touched-Down-in-Tallahassee-Sunday-300689511.html |title=Confirmed Tornado Touched Down in Leon County Sunday |work=[[WCTV-TV]] |access-date=November 22, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620070144/http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Confirmed-Tornado-Touched-Down-in-Tallahassee-Sunday-300689511.html |archive-date=June 20, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> Damage included numerous downed tree limbs and a car crushed by a falling tree. During extremely heavy rains, some low-lying parts of Tallahassee may flood, notably the Franklin Boulevard area adjacent to the downtown and the Killearn Lakes subdivision, outside the Tallahassee city limits, on the north side.

The most recent tornadoes to hit the city were EF2's on May 10, 2024. One of them hit downtown Tallahassee, being {{Convert|1400|yd|m}} wide.

==Law, government and politics==
[[File:FlaSupremeCrtBldgFeb08.JPG|thumb|The [[Florida Supreme Court]] building]]

===Politics===
Tallahassee has traditionally been a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] city, but the party has been supported by different ethnic groups over time, with a major shift in the late 20th century. Leon County has voted Democratic in 24 of the past 29 presidential elections since 1904. But until the late 1960s, most African Americans were [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] from the political system, dating from a new constitution and other laws passed by Democrats in Florida (and in all other Southern states) at the turn of the century. At that time, most African Americans were affiliated with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and their disenfranchisement resulted in that party being non-competitive in the region for decades. Subsequently, these demographic groups traded party alignments.

Since passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] and enforcement of constitutional rights for African Americans, voters in Tallahassee have elected black mayors and black state representatives.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://users.ipfw.edu/jehle/deisenbe/JHPcolumn/jhp102.pdf |title=In Tallahassee |magazine=Journal of Hispanic Philology |volume=10 |number=2 |first=Daniel |last=Eisenberg |year=1986 |pages=97–101 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006090302/http://users.ipfw.edu/jehle/deisenbe/JHPcolumn/jhp102.pdf |archive-date=October 6, 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>{{rp|97}} It has become a city in the [[Southern United States|Southern U.S.]] that is known for [[Progressivism|progressive]] activism.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} This is likely due to the large student population that attends [[Florida State University]], [[Florida A&M University]], and [[Tallahassee State College]].

Merging governments would cut government waste, duplication of services, etc. However, Professor Richard Feiock of the Department of Public Administration of [[Korea University]] and the [[Askew School of Public Administration and Policy]] of [[Florida State University]] states that no discernible relationship exists between consolidation and the local economy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fsu.edu/~localgov/publication_files/Feiock&Park&Kang_Consolidation_K3.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614150850/http://www.fsu.edu/~localgov/publication_files/Feiock%26Park%26Kang_Consolidation_K3.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 14, 2007 |title=City County Consolidation Efforts: Selective Incentives and Institutional Choice |access-date=August 2, 2014}}</ref>

===Flag===
The former flag of Tallahassee was vaguely similar to the [[flag of Florida]], a white [[saltire]] on a blue field, with the city's coat of arms, featuring the cupola of the [[Florida State Capitol|old capitol building]], at the center. The flag is an homage to the Scottish and Ulster-Scots Presbyterian heritage of the original founders of the city, most of whom were settlers from North Carolina whose ancestors had either come to America directly from Scotland, or were Presbyterians of Scottish descent from [[County Down]] and [[County Antrim]] in what has since become [[Northern Ireland]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Purcell |first=John M. |title=American City Flags (Part I: United States): 150 Flags from Akron to Yonkers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ztmAAAAMAAJ&q=%22white+saltire+on+a+dark+blue+field%22 |access-date=February 11, 2011 |year=2004 |publisher=North American Vexillological Association |location=Trenton, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-9747728-0-6 |page=345}}</ref> The current flag incorporates a stylized 5-point star and the city name on a white background.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tallahassee.com/story/opinion/2017/08/11/calmet-design-new-flag-tallahassee/559081001/?cookies=&from=global |title=Calmet: Design a new flag for Tallahassee |website=Tallahassee.com |access-date=November 22, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903074732/http://www.tallahassee.com/story/opinion/2017/08/11/calmet-design-new-flag-tallahassee/559081001/?cookies=&from=global |archive-date=September 3, 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:MaclayLowerSchl-1.JPG|thumb|Lower School students at [[Maclay School]] celebrating Grandparents Day in 2008]]
Tallahassee anchors the [[Leon County School District]]. As of the 2009 school year Leon County Schools had an estimated 32,796 students, 2209 teachers and 2100 administrative and support personnel. The superintendent of schools is Rocky Hanna. Leon County public school enrollment continues to grow steadily (up approximately 1% per year since the 1990–91 school year). The dropout rate for grades 9–12 improved to 2.2% in the 2007–2008 school year, the third time in the past four years the dropout rate has been below 3%.

To gauge performance the State of Florida rates all public schools according to student achievement on the state-sponsored Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT). Seventy-nine percent of Leon County Public Schools received an A or B grade in the 2008–2009 school year. The overall district grade assigned to the Leon County Schools is "A". Students in the Leon County School District continued to score favorably in comparison to Florida and national averages in the SAT and ACT student assessment tests. The Leon County School District has consistently scored at or above the average for districts statewide in total ACT and SAT mean composite scores.

Established in 1826, the [[Tallahassee Police Department]] once claimed to be the oldest police department in the Southern United States and the second-oldest in the U.S., preceded only by the [[Philadelphia Police Department]] (established in 1758). The [[Boston Police Department]] was established in 1838 and larger East Coast cities followed with New York City and Baltimore in 1845. However, this is proven incorrect. Pensacola, Florida, for example, had a municipal police force as early as 1821.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Domherty |first1=Herbert J. Jr. |date=1954 |title=The Governorship of Andrew Jackson |journal=The Florida Historical Quarterly |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=3–31 |jstor=30138932}}</ref>

There are over 800 sworn law enforcement officers in Tallahassee. Law enforcement services are provided by the [[Tallahassee Police Department]], the [[Leon County Sheriff's Office]], the [[Florida Department of Law Enforcement]], [[Florida Capitol Police]], [[Florida State University Police Department]], [[Florida A&M University]] Police Department, the Tallahassee State College Police Department, the [[Florida Highway Patrol]], and the [[Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission]].

The Tallahassee Growth Management Building Inspection Division is responsible for issuing permits and performing inspections of public and private buildings in the city limits. These duties include the enforcement of the Florida Building Codes and the Florida Fire Protection Codes. These standards are present to protect life and property. The Tallahassee Building Department is one of 13 Accredited Building Departments in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |title=Building Department Accreditation |url=http://www.iasonline.org/Building_Department_Program/BDA.html |publisher=International Accreditation Service |access-date=May 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519121525/http://iasonline.org/Building_Department_Program/BDA.html |archive-date=May 19, 2011}}</ref>

*The streamlined ''[[Gulf Wind]]'' coach and [[Pullman sleeping car|Pullman]] passenger train, operated jointly by the [[Louisville and Nashville|L&N]] and [[Seaboard Air Line Railroad|Seaboard]] railroads, served Tallahassee from 1949 to 1971, when the newly formed [[Amtrak]] cancelled the train.
*[[Amtrak]]'s ''[[Sunset Limited]]'' served Tallahassee from April 1993 until service east of New Orleans was suspended in August 2005, following [[Hurricane Katrina]], which caused extensive damage to CSX lines from Louisiana to Florida.
