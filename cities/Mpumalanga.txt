'''Mpumalanga''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|m|ˌ|p|uː|m|ə|ˈ|l|ɑː|ŋ|ɡ|ə}}) is one of the nine [[provinces of South Africa]]. The name means "'''East'''", or literally "'''The Place Where the Sun Rises'''" in the [[Nguni languages]]. Mpumalanga lies in eastern South Africa, bordering [[Eswatini]] and [[Mozambique]].  It shares borders with the South African provinces of [[Limpopo]] to the north, [[Gauteng]] to the west, the [[Free State (province)|Free State]] to the southwest, and [[KwaZulu-Natal]] to the south. The capital is [[Mbombela]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Home |url=https://www.mbombela.gov.za/ |access-date=2022-05-25 |website=www.mbombela.gov.za}}</ref>

Mpumalanga was formed in 1994, when the area that was the Eastern [[Transvaal (province)|Transvaal]] was merged with the former [[bantustan|bantustans]] [[KaNgwane]], [[KwaNdebele]] and parts of [[Lebowa]] and [[Gazankulu]]. Although the contemporary borders of the province were only formed at the end of [[apartheid]], the region and its surroundings have a history that extends back thousands of years. Much of its history, and current significance is as a region of trade.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book |first=Peter |last=Delius |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/608393212 |title=Mpumalanga : history and heritage |date=2007 |publisher=University of Kwazulu-Natal Press |oclc=608393212}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Precolonial Era ===
[[File:Iziko Lydenburg Heads 2.JPG|alt=Lydenburg Head |thumb|One of the [[Lydenburg heads|Lydenburg Heads]] from around A.D. 500 found in Mpumalanga ]]
Archeological sites in the Mpumalanga region indicate settlement by humans and their [[Human ancestors|ancestors]] dating back 1.7 million years.<ref name=":3" /> Rock paintings, engravings and other archeological evidence throughout the province indicate that Mpumalanga has a long history of human habitation by groups of hunter gatherers. Excavations not far from the Mpumalanga border in the [[Ohrigstad|Origstad]] district, show evidence of [[Middle Stone Age]] habitation dating back to 40,000 years ago.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |last=Esterhuysen |first=Amanda |date=2007 |title=The Archaeology of Mpumalanga |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328389657}}</ref> The Lion Cavern, in [[Ngwenya]] on the [[Eswatini]] border, shows evidence of people mining iron ore in the Mpumalanga region and surrounding areas from at least 28 000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Dart |first1=R.

Evidence from mine shafts and trade goods shows that there was notable industry in tin, copper, gold, iron, ochre, and bronze. The [[Lydenburg heads|Lydenburg Heads]], from around 500 CE, are Africa's oldest Iron Age artworks south of the equator and were found in Mpumalanga.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/lyde/hd_lyde.htm |access-date=11 April 2022|website=metmuseum.org |title=Lydenburg Heads (Ca. 500 A.D.) &#124; Essay &#124; the Metropolitan Museum of Art &#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History }}</ref> Evidence from a site near [[Mbombela]] shows evidence of agricultural societies from between the 6th to 17th century.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Prehistory of the Nelspruit area {{!}} South African History Online |url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/prehistory-nelspruit-area |access-date=11 April 2022|website=sahistory.org.za}}</ref> 

[[Bokoni]] stone-walled sites on the Mpumalanga highveld are indicative of a large precolonial agropastoral society between ~1500 and 1820 CE.<ref>{{Cite web |date=16 September 2014 |title=Forgotten World |url=https://witspress.co.za/catalogue/forgotten-world/ |access-date=14 September 2020 |website=Wits University Press |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=One of the most extraordinary archaeological and historical phenomena in Southern Africa {{!}} The Heritage Portal |url=http://www.theheritageportal.co.za/article/one-most-extraordinary-archaeological-and-historical-phenomena-southern-africa |access-date=14 September 2020 |website=theheritageportal.co.za}}</ref> These societies became centers of trade, with increasingly large and centralised populations This pattern  increased as they connected to the Portuguese trading post in [[Maputo Bay]].<ref name=":2" /> 

In this era, groups that would become the [[Swazi people|Swazi]], [[Pedi people|Pedi]], [[Southern Ndebele people|Ndebele]], [[MaPulana|Mapulana]] and others established themselves in the area that is now Mpumalanga.{{cn|date=August 2023}}

=== Colonial era ===
In 1845, as part of the [[Great Trek]], the first Dutch-speaking colonial settlers arrived in what they called the eastern Transvaal.<ref name=":3" /> The rest of the 19th century in the region was characterised by colonial encroachment and conflict over land and political control. In 1852, the Boers established the [[South African Republic]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Eybers |first=G. W. (George von Welfling) |url=http://archive.org/details/cu31924030542165 |title=Select constitutional documents illustrating South African history, 1795-1910 |date=1918 |publisher=London : G. Routledge & Sons; New York, E.P. Dutton & Co. |others=Cornell University Library}}</ref> The well established Pedi, Swazi and Zulu kingdoms put up significant resistance against the settlers. The [[Pedi people|Pedi]] fought wars with the [[Boers]] in 1876 (see [[South African Wars (1879–1915)|Sekhukhune Wars]]) and the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] fought with [[1820 Settlers|British settlers]] in 1879 (see [[Anglo-Zulu War]]). These interconnected conflicts played a role in shifting the balance of power in southern Africa to colonial control.<ref name=":3" /> After 1860, missionaries, especially German missionaries like [[Alexander Merensky]] set up mission stations in the region, spreading Christianity and European values.<ref name=":3" /> 

Just as the region had been a center for trade in the precolonial era, in the colonial era, the Eastern Transvaal region became an important thoroughfare for trade between [[Johannesburg]] and Delagoa Bay (now [[Maputo]]). Gold mining around areas like [[Pilgrim's Rest, South Africa|Pilgrims Rest]] and [[Barberton, Mpumalanga|Barberton]] and farming were the main forms of economic activity. On farms in the Transvaal, under a system known as [[Inboekstelsel]], Boers carried out raids to capture children and forced them into indentured labour.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Calder. |first=Campbell, Gwyn, 1952- Miers, Suzanne. Miller, Joseph |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/811623995 |title=Women and slavery |date=2008 |publisher=Ohio University Press |isbn=978-0-8214-1725-6 |oclc=811623995}}</ref> During the [[Second Boer War|South African War]], the region was the site of notable battles.

=== Apartheid ===
When the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] came to power in 1948, their policy of [[apartheid]]  intensified the segregation that had defined communities in the [[Transvaal (province)|Transvaal]]. Under a policy of forced removals, Black South Africans were evicted from areas reserved for white people and moved into homelands, including [[KaNgwane]], [[KwaNdebele]], [[Lebowa]] and [[Gazankulu]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mpumalanga {{!}} South African History Online |url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/place/mpumalanga |access-date=26 May 2022 |website=sahistory.org.za}}</ref> As the apartheid regime implemented oppressive [[Apartheid legislation|policies]] that defined almost every aspect of life, activists responded with resistance. 

In 1959, the small town of [[Bethal]] on what is now the Mpumalanga highveld was the center of the [[South African potato boycott|anti-apartheid consumer potato boycott]] in response to the working conditions Black South African labourers faced on farms in the area.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Don't eat potatoes! {{!}} South African History Online |url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/dont-eat-potatoes |access-date=27 May 2022 |website=sahistory.org.za}}</ref> The region was influenced by dynamics in exile and elsewhere in the country, for instance [[Black Consciousness Movement|Black Consciousness]], the [[Sharpeville massacre|Sharpeville Massacre]] and the [[Soweto uprising|1976 Soweto Uprisings]]. In the 1980s, under intense repression, youth and labour organizations moblized against the government and townships and Bantustans erupted in political unrest and violence.<ref name=":3" />  

In 1986, an avoidable disaster {{clarify|date=August 2023}} killed 177 mine workers in [[Kinross, Mpumalanga|Kinross Mine]] in the region's highveld. The response to the disaster by the [[National Union of Mineworkers (South Africa)|National Union of Mineworkers]] was a key point in the South African labour struggle. By the late 1980s, the intensity of resistance across South Africa (including areas like Mpumalanga, which hadn't previously been seen as key areas of resistance) combined with economic factors and international pressure was strong enough to end apartheid. On 27 April 1994, when South Africa held its [[End of Apartheid|first democratic elections]], Mpumalanga province was formed. It was originally called the "Eastern Transvaal" province, but the name was later changed to Mpumalanga on 24 August 1995.{{cn|date=August 2023}}

=== Post-apartheid ===
The liberation movement turned leading party, the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) came into power in Mpumalanga after white minority rule ended. A program of [[Land reform in South Africa|land redistribution]], aimed at granting land back to the black communities who were forcibly moved during apartheid, had redistributed tens of thousands of hectares to these communities and their descendants. However, the process has been marked by corruption, controversy and has been seen as inadequate to address the extent of apartheid spatial planning.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bloom |first=Kevin |date=19 March 2022 |title=DM168 INVESTIGATION: Case number 35402/2010 – the Mabuzas and the giant Mpumalanga land claims 'scam' |url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2022-03-19-the-giant-mpumalanga-land-claims-scam/ |access-date=11 June 2022|website=Daily Maverick |language=en}}</ref> 

In 2001, 1,270 hectares of the Boomplaats farm near [[Lydenburg|Mashishing]] was the first farm in South Africa to be expropriated.<ref>{{Cite web |title=First farm to be expropriated |url=https://www.news24.com/news24/first-farm-to-be-expropriated-20010212 |access-date=11 June 2022|website=News24 |language=en-US}}</ref>

The [[Drakensberg]] escarpment divides Mpumalanga into a westerly half consisting mainly of high-altitude [[grassland]] called the [[Highveld]] and an eastern half situated in low-altitude subtropical [[Lowveld]]/[[Bushveld]], mostly [[savanna]] habitat. The southern half of the [[Kruger National Park]] is in the latter region. The Drakensberg exceeds heights of 2000&nbsp;m in most places, with this central region of Mpumalanga being very mountainous. These regions have alpine grasslands and small pockets of [[Knysna-Amatole montane forests|Afromontane forest]]. The Lowveld is relatively flat with interspersed rocky outcrops. The [[Lebombo Mountains]] form a low range in the far east, on the border with [[Mozambique]].

Some of the oldest rocks on earth have been found in the [[Barberton, Mpumalanga|Barberton]] area; these ancient [[greenstone belt|greenstones]] and [[Metamorphism|metamorphosed]] [[granite]]s form the Crocodile River Mountains in the southeast of the province. The Lowveld is underlaid by [[Kalahari Craton|African Cratonic Basement]] rocks of ages in excess of 2&nbsp;billion years. The Highveld is mostly [[Karoo Sequence]] [[sedimentary rock]] of a younger, [[Carboniferous]] to [[Permian]] age.

Mpumalanga is the only South African province to border two [[provinces of Mozambique]] ([[Gaza Province]] to the northeast and [[Maputo Province]] to the east), as well as all four [[regions of Eswatini]] ([[Lubombo District|Lubombo]], [[Hhohho]], [[Manzini District|Manzini]], and [[Shiselweni]] districts).

=== Climate ===
The Lowveld is [[subtropical]], due to its latitude and proximity to the warm [[Indian Ocean]]. The Highveld is comparatively much cooler and drier, due to its elevation of 1700&nbsp;m to 2300&nbsp;m above sea level. The Drakensberg escarpment receives the most [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], with all other areas being moderately well-watered by mostly-summer [[thunderstorms]]. The Highveld often experiences considerable freezing, while the Lowveld is mostly frost-free. Winter rainfall is rare, except for some drizzle on the [[escarpment]]. The differences in climate are demonstrated by comparing the capital, [[Mbombela]], which is in the Lowveld, with [[Belfast, Mpumalanga|Belfast]], which is an hour away on the Highveld:

* Mbombela averages: January maximum: 29&nbsp;°C (min: 19&nbsp;°C), July maximum: 23&nbsp;°C (min: 6&nbsp;°C), annual precipitation: 767&nbsp;mm
* Belfast averages: January maximum: 23&nbsp;°C (min: 12&nbsp;°C), June maximum: 15&nbsp;°C (min: 1&nbsp;°C), annual precipitation: 878&nbsp;mm
With [[climate change]] in the province, rainfall is becoming more variable, temperatures and evaporation rates are rising and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent. It is predicted that these changes will shift biomes so that most of the province will be savanna.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mpumalanga |url=https://letsrespondtoolkit.org/municipalities/mpumalanga/ |access-date=27 May 2022 |website=Lets Respond Toolkit |language=en-US}}</ref>   [[File:Spitskop.jpg|thumb|Proteas near [[Sabie]]]]

== Ecology ==
Some of the [[Earliest known life forms|earliest signs of life]] on Earth have been found in Mpumalanga. In the [[Makhonjwa Mountains|Makhonjwa mountain]] range's greenstone belt near [[Barberton, Mpumalanga|Barberton]], a fossil layer shows microbial activity that is 3.22 billion years old. This discovery indicates that life emerged on Earth 300 million years earlier than previously thought.<ref name="sciencedaily_2016-11"/>

Mpumalanga has a high plant and animal diversity. Many species are [[Endemism|endemic]] to the province.

68% of land area in the province is used by agriculture. The climatic contrasts between the drier [[Highveld]] region, with its cold winters, and the hot, humid [[Veld|Lowveld]] allow for a variety of agricultural activities. Mpumalanga has been an important supplier of fruit and vegetables for local and international markets for decades.<ref name="Mather 426–436">{{Cite journal |last=Mather |first=Charles |date=November 2000 |title=Foreign Migrants in Export Agriculture: Mozambican Labour in the Mpumalanga Lowveld, South Africa |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9663.00128 |journal=Tijdschrift voor economische en sociale geografie |volume=91 |issue=4 |pages=426–436 |doi=10.1111/1467-9663.00128 |issn=0040-747X}}</ref> A history of dispossession mean that farming land is largely white owned, although policies of land redistribution era aim to address this.
