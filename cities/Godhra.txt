'''Godhra''' ({{IAST|Godhrā}}) is a [[municipality]] in [[Panchmahal]] district in [[Indian state]] of [[Gujarat]]. It is the administrative headquarters of the [[Panchmahal]] district. Originally the name came from ''gou'' which means "cow" and ''dhara''- which have two meanings depending on how you pronounce the word: 'dharaa' means a feminine thing or person that "holds" something and it usually means"land", and the other pronunciation is 'dhaaraa' in which means "flow". However, the second pronunciation is not popular nor is usually associated with this word.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}} Hence, 'Godhra or Godharaa' means the Land of the [[Cow]].

Godhra is widely known in India and internationally for being the starting point of the [[2002 Gujarat riots]]. Statewide religious riots between [[Hindus]] and [[Muslims]] began after the [[Godhra train burning]] incident near the Godhra railway station on 27 February 2002, where about 59 train passengers were burnt alive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article1513008.ece?homepage=true&sms_ss=email&at_xt=4d732c194ed160ba%2C0|title=It was not a random attack on S-6 but kar sevaks were targeted, says judge |first1=Manas|last1=Dasgupta|date=2011-03-06|access-date=2016-10-27|work=[[The Hindu]]}}</ref> It was in Godhra that [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] first met [[Mohandas Gandhi|Gandhi]] in 1917 and was subsequently drawn into the Indian freedom struggle.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gandhi|first1=Rajmohan|title=Patel a Life|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Navjivan trust|isbn=978-8172291389}}</ref>
