'''Bujumbura''' ({{IPA|fr|buʒumbuʁa}}; {{IPA|rw|buʒuᵐbuɾa}}), formerly '''Usumbura''', is the economic capital, largest city and main port of [[Burundi]]. It ships most of the country's chief export, [[coffee]], as well as [[cotton]] and [[tin]] ore. Bujumbura was formerly the country's political capital. In late December 2018, Burundian president [[Pierre Nkurunziza]] announced that he would follow through on a 2007 promise to return [[Gitega]] its former political capital status, with Bujumbura remaining as economical capital and center of commerce. A vote in the [[Parliament of Burundi]] made the change official on 16 January 2019, with all branches of government expected to move to Gitega within three years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businessghana.com/site/news/politics/180180/Burundi-to-change-its-capital-city|title=Burundi to change its capital city|date=18 January 2019|website=BusinessGhana|access-date=10 January 2020}}</ref>{{Update inline|date=July 2024}}

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Bujumbura}}
{{section-stub|date=September 2024}}
Bujumbura grew from a small village after it became a military post in [[German East Africa]] in 1889. After [[World War I]] it was made the administrative center of the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[League of Nations]] mandate of [[Ruanda-Urundi]]. The name was changed from Usumbura to Bujumbura when Burundi became independent in 1962.<ref>Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 72</ref> Since independence, Bujumbura has been the scene of frequent fighting between the country's two main ethnic groups, with [[Hutu]] militias opposing the [[Tutsi]]-dominated Burundi army.

==Geography==
[[File:Bujumbura & Lake Tanganyika.JPG|thumb|left|[[Lake Tanganyika]]]]

Bujumbura is on the north-eastern shore of [[Lake Tanganyika]], the second [[List of lakes by depth|deepest lake in the world]] after [[Lake Baikal]]. The city also lies at the mouth of the [[Ruzizi River]] and the smaller [[Mutimbuzi River|Mutimbuzi]], [[Ntahangwa River|Ntahangwa]], [[Muha River|Muha]] and [[Kanyosha River]]s.

===Climate===
Bujumbura has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Aw'')<ref name="Climate-Data.org">{{Cite web |url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/1073/ |title=Bujumbura - Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table |publisher=Climate-Data.org |access-date=2014-07-28 }}</ref> bordering on [[semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|hot semi-arid]] (''BSh''). There are distinct [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry seasons]]; the wet season being from October to April. Being close to the equator, average temperatures in the city vary little over the year, though they are affected by its altitude. The high temperature is around {{convert|29|°C}} and the low around {{convert|19|°C}}.

Bujumbura is governed by a community council and community administrator. It is further divided into three ''[[Bujumbura Mairie Province#Administrative subdivisions|communes]]'', or neighborhoods, each with its own council and council leader.<ref>[http://www.villedebujumbura.org/spip.php?article3 L’administration de la Municipalité de Bujumbura, official city website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206051231/http://www.villedebujumbura.org/spip.php?article3 |date=February 6, 2009 }}</ref>

Each of the three current communes were created from the 13 former communes (currently sub-communes), due to a 2014 reorganization, which in turn are further sub-divided into villages or zones:<ref>https://www.refworld.org/docid/57f792e34.html Refworld | Burundi: List of all the neighbourhoods of Bujumbura, including the ethnicity and socio-economic status of the inhabitants of those neighbourhoods (2014-September 2016)</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:View of bujumbura.JPG|thumb|View of Bujumbura Market]]
{{seealso|Markets in Bujumbura|Economy of Burundi}}
The [[Port of Bujumbura]] is the largest port on Lake Tanganyika.{{sfn|Burundi Port of Bujumbura Logistics Cluster}}
Burundi depends on neighboring countries for access to the ocean. 
Goods may be carried by road via Rwanda, or by the lake and then by road or rail via Tanzania, Congo or Zambia.
80% of Burundi's external trade is carried via the last three routes, using the Port of Bujumbura.{{sfn|Exploitation du Port de Bujumbura|p=2}}
The port manages receipt and delivery of exports and imports, whether carried by ship or by truck.
As of 2011 more than 90% of cargo handled was imports, of which about 60% entered by ship and 40% by truck.{{sfn|Study of Master Plan for Port Sector|p=8}}

[[Bujumbura Central Market]] was in the city centre, along Rwagasore Avenue. During the [[1993 ethnic violence in Burundi]], citizens became less likely to travel far from the city centre, and markets in neighbouring communities lost their business to the central market.{{fact|date=September 2024}}
At dawn on 27 January 2013 a serious fire ravaged the central market.<ref>[http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20130127-burundi-vaste-incendie-marche-central-bujumbura Burundi: vaste incendie au marché central de Bujumbura] ''[[Radio France internationale]]'', 27 janvier 2013</ref> Due to the poor emergency response, the fire lasted for hours, resulting in a serious blow to local exchanges. Hundreds of vendors, local and foreign, lost their goods to the fire and the reported [[looting]].<ref>[http://www.agoravox.fr/actualites/international/article/incendie-au-marche-central-de-131282 Incendie au marché central de Bujumbura: des Sénégalais dans la désolation] ''[[Agoravox]]'', 25 Février 2013</ref>
