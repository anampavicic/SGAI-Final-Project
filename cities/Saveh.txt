==History==
In the 7th century BC it was a stronghold of the [[Medes]]. During the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian rule of Persia]], it was called '''Saavakineh''', and was one of the main hubs of the empire.

In the 11th century, it was a residence of the [[Daylamites]] and of the [[Seljuks]]. It was severely damaged by the Mongol invasion in the 13th century; it was restored during the [[Ilkhanids]]. Saveh was again sacked by the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]], but later grew under the [[Safavids]]. In the summer of 1725 the city was besieged and captured by the [[Hotak dynasty|Afghans]] after a battle with Tahmasp Mirza.<ref>{{Cite book|isbn=2910640051|title=The Afghan Occupation of Safavid Persia, 1721-1729|last1=Floor|first1=Willem M.|year=1998|publisher=Peeters Publishers & Booksellers }}</ref> It eventually lost much of its importance when [[Tehran]] became the official capital of Persia and, in the mid-19th century, many of the inhabitants moved to Tehran.

==Economy==
Saveh produces large amounts of wheat and cotton. It is also well known for its pomegranates and melons.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Columbia Gazetteer of the World|url=https://archive.org/details/columbiagazettee02cohe|url-access=registration|first=Saul|last=Cohen|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1998|page=2833|isbn=9780231110402 }}</ref> Kaveh Industrial City, the largest industrial city in Iran, is located in Saveh.

==Main sights==
*[[Jameh Mosque of Saveh]], built by the Seljuks during the 11th century. It includes  a courtyard, porch, a 14&nbsp;m tall minaret,  nocturnal areas, a tiled dome (14 m tall, with a diameter of 16&nbsp;m) and two  altars with inscription in Kufic script.
*Red Mosque of Saveh, also known as Enqelab Mosque. Dating to the [[Seljuk-era]], it has a brickwork dome, an 11th-century minaret, three porticoes, and internally houses an altar with plasterwork and inscriptions.
*Imamzadeh Soltan Seyed Eshaq Mausoleum
*Sorkhdeh Bridge, south of the city
*Khamseh-Abad caravansarai

Outside the city are the fortresses of Esmaeilieh (35&nbsp;km), Alvir and Ardemin (56&nbsp;km, on the road to [[Hamadan]]), as well as the archaeological sites of Aveh and Alishar.

==Legends==
According to Iranian tradition, the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]] who visited the infant [[Jesus]] traveled from Saveh, and are buried among its ruins. [[Marco Polo]] described the tombs of the Magi in his travel book, ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Il Milione]]'':

{{quote|In Persia is the city of Saba, from which the Three Magi set out... and in this city they are buried, in three very large and beautiful monuments, side by side. And above them there is a square building, beautifully kept. The bodies are still entire, with hair and beard remaining. (Book i).<ref name="polo">{{cite book | author = [[Marco Polo|Polo, Marco]] and [[Rustichello da Pisa]] | year = 1903 | title = The Travels of Marco Polo: The Complete Yule-Cordier Edition | editor = [[Henry Yule]] and [[Henri Cordier]] | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10636/10636-8.txt}}</ref>}}

Saveh is said to have possessed one of the greatest libraries in the [[Middle East]], until its destruction by the [[Mongols]] during their first invasion of Iran.<ref name="polo"/>

Another legend about Saveh is the Lake of Saveh. It is a lake which is said to have been located near the city. According to the legend mentioned in historical Persian texts, this lake dried out on the night of the birth of [[Muhammad]]. A recent investigation in the Zarand area between Tehran and Saveh has revealed some evidence of the existence of this lake in [[Zarand Plain]].<ref>Okhravi, R. and Djamali, M. (2003). "The missing ancient lake of Saveh: a historical review". ''Iranica Antiqua'', 38, 327-344.</ref>

==Politics==
In 2004, Saveh became only the second city in the history of the [[History of Iran|Islamic Republic]] to appoint a woman as mayor.<ref name="mayor"/>

==Notable people==
* [[Yusuf Adil Shah]] (former [[Mamluk]] and founder of the [[Bijapur Sultanate]])
