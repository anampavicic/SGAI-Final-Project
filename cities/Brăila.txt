==History==
[[File:Braila.jpg|thumb|A 1900s postcard of Brăila]]
[[File:Brăila 19th century.jpg|thumb|Brăila in the late 19th century or early 20th century]]
===Origins===
Before 14th century, a small village existed in the place of today's Brăila, probably inhabited by fishermen and small merchants.<ref name="Rădvan248">Rădvan, p.248</ref> The village fell to the Mongols during the 1241 [[Mongol invasion of Europe]] and it was under direct control of the rulers of [[Curtea de Argeș|Argeș]] in mid-14th century.<ref name="Rădvan248"/>

A settlement called ''Drinago'' was found in several 14th century Catalan and Castillian [[portolan chart]]s ([[Angelino de Dalorto]], 1325/1330 and [[Angelino Dulcert]], 1339), as well as in the ''[[Book of Knowledge of All Kingdoms]]''. This may have been an erroneous transcription of ''Brillago'', a name which was later used in 15th century traveller's journals.<ref name="Rădvan249">Rădvan, p.249</ref>

In [[Greek language|Greek]] documents of roughly that time, the city is referred to as ''Proilabum'' or ''Proilava'', a Greek language adaptation of its [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] name, ''Brailov''. In [[German language]] sources, it is mentioned as ''Uebereyl''.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The origin and meaning of the name is unknown, but it is thought to be an [[anthroponym]].<ref name="Rădvan249"/>

The first certain document mentioning Brăila is a privilege act, given by [[Vladislav I of Wallachia]] to German merchants of Brașov, who were exempt of customs duties when they followed the road from Brașov to the Danube ''via Braylan''.<ref name="Rădvan250">Rădvan, p.250</ref>

===Wallachian harbour===
Following the fall of [[Vicina (town)|Vicina]], Brăila developed as the main harbour of [[Wallachia]],<ref name="Rădvan250"/> gaining the town status around 1400.<ref name="Rădvan252"/>

In 1396, [[Johann Schiltberger]] writes that Brăila was the place where ships docked, bringing "goods from heathen lands".<ref name="Rădvan252">Rădvan, p.252</ref> Foreign merchants bringing goods were forced to unload their merchandise in Brăila, as it can be understood from a 1445 account of [[Walerand de Wavrin]].<ref name="Rădvan252"/> A 1520 Ottoman account tells about the arrival of 70-80 ships in Brăila, bringing goods from [[Asia Minor]] and [[Crimea]].<ref name="Rădvan252"/> The town was also an important center of the fish trade: Polish merchants came to purchase it (1408) and this lucrative trade was taxed by the rulers following Vladislav I.<ref name="Rădvan252"/>

The town did have autonomy, being ruled by ''[[Burgher (title)|pârgari]]'' and a ''[[județ]]''. We know little about the ethnic structure of the town, but it is expected it was quite diverse, having inhabitants from many backgrounds. One document from 1500 talks about ''Mihoci Latinețul'', a [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] who had lived in Brăila for five years and was a member of the community.<ref name="Rădvan253">Rădvan, p.253</ref>

In 1462, [[Mehmed the Conqueror]]'s fleet of 25 [[trireme]]s and 150 other ships burnt the city to the ground.<ref name="Rădvan253"/> The city was also caught in the conflict between Wallachia and the [[Principality of Moldavia|Moldavian]] prince [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]], as the Moldavians destroyed the city during the retaliation campaign against [[Principality of Wallachia|Wallachian]] prince [[Radu cel Frumos|Radu the Fair]].<ref name="Rădvan253"/> An account of the Moldavian attack is found in ''[[Cronica breviter scripta]]'':<ref name="Rădvan253"/>

{{quotation|much blood was shed, and the town burned to the ground, not leaving even the children of mothers to live, and sliced open the breasts of mothers and ripped the children from them}}

The conflict was not just political, as the town of Brăila competed against Moldavian town of [[Kiliya|Chilia]].<ref name="Rădvan254">Rădvan, p.254</ref> Nevertheless, Brăila recovered, soon becoming the gateway for [[Levant]]ine goods into Wallachia.<ref name="Rădvan254"/> The town was burnt again by [[Bogdan III of Moldavia]] in 1512.<ref name="Rădvan254"/>

===Ottoman harbour===
Around 1538–1540, perhaps during the [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]'s military expedition against [[Petru Rareș]], the city became a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], being organized as a [[kaza]] and forming part of the [[Silistra Eyalet]].<ref name="Rădvan254"/> The town was part of the Empire's northern defensive network and the Ottomans built a stone stronghold in the town.<ref name="Rădvan255">Rădvan, p.255</ref>

The Ottoman Empire ruled it from 1538–1540 until 1829; the Ottomans called it ''Ibrail'' or ''Ibraila''. It was briefly ruled by [[Michael the Brave]], prince of Wallachia (1595–1596) before it was recaptured by the Ottomans.

===Modern history===
In 1711, the city was besieged and conquered by a [[Wallachia]]n-[[Russian Empire|Russian]] army during the [[Pruth River Campaign]]. In 1828, the siege of Brăila took place. In 1829, it was granted to Wallachia by the [[Akkerman Convention]].

During the 19th century, the port became one of the three most important ports on the Danube in Wallachia, the other two being [[Drobeta-Turnu Severin|Turnu]] and [[Giurgiu]]. The city's greatest period of prosperity was at the end of the 19th century and in the early 20th century, when it was an important port for most of the merchandise coming in and going out of Romania.

During [[World War II]], Brăila was captured on 28 August 1944 by [[Red Army|Soviet]] troops of the [[3rd Ukrainian Front]] in the course of the [[Second Jassy–Kishinev Offensive|Jassy–Kishinev Offensive]].

After the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]], Brăila entered a period of economic decline.

==Geography==
Brăila is part of the strategically important [[Focșani Gate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newstrategycenter.ro/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Policy-Paper-Focsani-Gate.pdf|title=The Focșani Gate – a key terrain for European security|first1=Mircea|last1=Mîndrescu|first2=Gregory|last2=Melcher|first3=Phillip|last3=Petersen|publisher=New Strategy Center, Centre for the Study of the New Generation Warfare|pages=1–20|year=2019}}</ref>

==Economy==
Accessible to small and medium-sized oceangoing ships, Brăila has large grain-handling and warehousing facilities. It is also an important industrial center, with metalworking, textile, food-processing, and other factories. The naval industry is one of the focus of Brăila's revenue bringers.

==Cityscape==
Brăila has the following districts: Centru (Center), Viziru (1, 2, 3), [[Călărași 4]], Ansamblul Buzăului, Radu Negru, Obor, Hipodrom, Lacu Dulce, Dorobanți, 1 Mai, Comorofca, Calea Galați, Gării, Apollo, Siret, Pisc, Brăilița, [[Vidin-Progresul]], Islaz, and [[Chercea]].

[[File:Hotel Danubiu - Municipiul Braila - vedere de zi.jpg|thumb|Hotel Danubiu in Traian Square]]
Streets radiating from near the port towards Brăila's center are crossed at symmetrical intervals by concentric streets following the geometric design of the old Ottoman fortifications.

The old center of the city has many 19th-century buildings, some of them fully restored. The most important monuments are the [[Greek Church, Brăila|Greek Church]], erected in 1863–1872 by the [[Greeks of Romania|Greek]] community; the [[Church of the Holy Archangels Michael and Gabriel, Brăila|Church of the Holy Archangels Michael and Gabriel]], former ''[[mosque|jāmi]]'' during the Ottoman rule (until 1831) and oldest church in the city; the 19th-century [[St. Nicholas Church, Brăila|St. Nicholas Church]]; the [[Maria Filotti Theatre]]; the Palace of Culture and its Art Museum; the History Museum; and the old Water Tower. The latter houses a restaurant and a rotation system (360° in one hour). Still, the city has some landmarks from the 20th century, such as the [[Palace of Agriculture, Brăila|Palace of Agriculture]].

Another important site is the Public Garden, a park situated above the bank of the Danube with a view over the river and the [[Măcin Mountains]]. Early in 2006 the municipality received [[European Union]] funds to renovate the old center of the city, aiming to transform Brăila into a major tourist attraction of Muntenia.

The other important park of the city is the Monument Park, one of the largest urban parks in Romania, covering an area of up to {{convert|90|ha|abbr=off}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brailei.ro/obiectiv-braila/parcul-monument-braila/|title = Parcul Monument din Braila}}</ref> The park is home to the Natural Science permanent exhibition of Brăila Museum, hosting several dioramas that depict the flora and fauna of the region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.muzeulbrailei.ro/en/index.php?pn=2&idn=617|title=Braila Museum - Natural science - Exhibitions}}</ref>

The city also hosts an Armenian Apostolic church from the 19th century, the [[Armenian Church, Brăila|St. Mary Armenian Church]].

The city has several local newspapers, including ''Obiectiv-Vocea Brăilei'', ''[[Monitorul de Brăila]]'', ''[[Ziarul de Brăila]]'' and ''Arcașu'''.

===Rivalry with Galați===
Brăila has a deep rivalry with neighbouring Galați. This conflict has a long history and has reached the point of being studied by academics. In fact, a group of Romanian researchers have already published the book ''Galați – Brăila. Trecut. Actualitate. Perspective'' ("Galați – Brăila. Past. Present. Perspectives").<ref>{{cite news|url=https://adevarul.ro/locale/galati/cum-ajuns-rivalitatea-proverbiala-galati-braila-subiect-cercetare-academica-1_5e944c885163ec4271addd9c/index.html|title=Cum a ajuns rivalitatea proverbială dintre Galați și Brăila subiect de cercetare academică|first=Costel|last=Crangan|newspaper=[[Adevărul]]|date=13 April 2020|language=ro}}</ref><ref>[http://evidentacercetare.univ-danubius.ro/Surse/Set_012/ca4rDSxJNC.pdf Galați - Brăila.
