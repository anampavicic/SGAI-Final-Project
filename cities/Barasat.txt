==History==
During the [[Mughal Empire]] period, Sankar Chakraborty (a commander of the [[zamindar]] [[Pratapaditya]] and king of [[Jessore District|Jessore]] in present-day Bangladesh) came to Barasat, Kolkata in 1600 and established himself. In 1700, Hazarat Ekdil Shah moved to the town and was known as a social reformer. His tomb, in Kazipara, is a pilgrimage site for the Muslim community. Pratapaditya made his way to Kolkata from Jessore; Sirajudullah went to Kolkata from Murshidabad via Barasat on a road which became two national highways.

Under the [[British Raj]], [[East India Company]] officials from Calcutta (Kolkata) made Barasat a weekend retreat and built houses with gardens. [[Warren Hastings]] built his villa in the heart of Barasat and [[Bankim Chandra Chatterjee]] was the town's first Indian deputy magistrate.

[[Indigo dye|Indigo cultivation]] was a major industry and indigo merchants were known for their inhumane treatment of farmers. [[Titumir]], a farmer, fomented a revolution against indigo merchants in Barasat. [[Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar]], [[Pyari Charan Sarkar]] and [[Kalikrishna Mitra]] were known for social reformation in the town, including women's education and widow remarriage. During the early nineteenth century, Barasat Cadet College trained new recruits and cadets from Europe; the college closed in 1811.<ref name="gazetteer">{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=William Wilson|title=The Imperial Gazetteer of India|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924081223301|publisher=Trübner & co.|year=1885|page=[https://archive.org/details/cu31924081223301/page/n132 123]}}</ref><ref name="Book">{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Mortimer |title=The Cambridge History of India|publisher=Cambridge University Press (CUP)|year=1935|page=161}}</ref>

From 1834 to 1861, Barasat was the seat of Barasat District. The district became a subdivision of the Twenty-four Parganas district in 1861,<ref name="gazetteer"/> and Barasat is the headquarters of [[North 24 Parganas district]].<ref name="Barasat">{{cite web|url=http://jnnurmwestbengal.gov.in/PDF/ULB_ProfilesPDF/Barasat/Barasat%20muni%20profile.pdf |title=Barasat |publisher=jnnurmwestbengal.gov.in |access-date=5 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402174619/http://jnnurmwestbengal.gov.in/PDF/ULB_ProfilesPDF/Barasat/Barasat%20muni%20profile.pdf |archive-date=2 April 2012}}</ref>
