'''León''' ({{IPA|es|leˈon|lang|Pronunciation of León in Spanish.ogg}}; {{Leonese|Llión}} {{IPA-ast|ʎiˈoŋ|}}) is a city and [[Municipalities of Spain|municipality]] of [[Spain]], capital of the [[province of León]], part of the autonomous community of [[Castile and León]], in the northwest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. It has a population of 124,303 (2019),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ine.es/jaxiT3/Tabla.htm?t=2877&L=0|publisher=[[Instituto Nacional de Estadística (Spain)|Instituto Nacional de Estadística]]|title=León: Población por municipios y sexo}}</ref> by far the largest municipality in the province. The population of the metropolitan area, including the neighbouring [[San Andrés del Rabanedo]] and other smaller municipalities, accounts for around 200,000 inhabitants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilruv.es/data/documents/2014_02a_PRESENTACION-CIUDAD-LEON.pdf|page=11|date=30 October 2014|publisher=Ayuntamiento de León|title=León ante el reto del futuro}}</ref>

Founded as the military encampment of the ''[[Legio VI Victrix]]'' around 29 BC, its standing as an encampment city was consolidated with the definitive settlement of the ''[[Legio VII Gemina]]'' from 74 AD. Following its partial depopulation due to the [[Umayyad invasion of Hispania|Umayyad conquest]] of the peninsula, 910 saw the beginning of one of its most prominent historical periods, when it became the capital of the [[Kingdom of León]], which took active part in the [[Reconquista]] against the [[Moors]], and came to be one of the fundamental kingdoms of medieval Spain.

In 1188, the city hosted the first [[Parliament]] in European history under the reign of [[Alfonso IX of León|Alfonso IX]], and this is why in 2010 it was acknowledged by professor [[John Keane (political theorist)|John Keane]], the [[Spanish monarchy|King of Spain]] and the Junta of [[Castile and León]], as the "cradle of [[Parliamentarism]]". The Decreta of León were consequently included in the [[Memory of the World]] register by [[UNESCO]] in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Decreta of León of 1188 - The oldest documentary manifestation of the European parliamentary system|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-8/the-decreta-of-leon-of-1188-the-oldest-documentary-manifestation-of-the-european-parliamentary-system/|website=www.unesco.org|publisher=[[UNESCO]]}}</ref> The city's prominence began to decline in the early Middle Ages, partly due to the loss of independence after the union of the Leonese kingdom with the [[Crown of Castile]], consolidated in 1301.

After a period of stagnation during the [[Early modern period|early modern age]], it was one of the first cities to hold an uprising in the [[Peninsular War|Spanish War of Independence]], and some years later, in 1833 acquired the status of provincial capital. The end of the 19th and the 20th century saw a significant acceleration in the rate of urban expansion, when the city became an important communications hub of the northwest due to the rise of the coal mining industry and the arrival of the railroad.

León's historical and architectural heritage, as well as the numerous festivals hosted throughout the year (particularly noteworthy are the Easter processions) and its location on the [[French Way]] of the [[Way of St. James|Camino de Santiago]], which is ranked as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], make it a destination of both domestic and [[international tourism]]. Some of the city's most prominent historical buildings are the [[León Cathedral|Cathedral]], one of the finest examples of French-style classic Gothic architecture in Spain, the [[Basilica of San Isidoro]], one of the most important Romanesque churches in Spain and resting place of León's medieval monarchs, the [[Convent of San Marcos, León|Monastery of San Marcos]], an example of [[plateresque]] and Renaissance Spanish architecture, and the [[Casa de los Botines|Casa Botines]], a Modernist creation of the architect [[Antoni Gaudí]]. An example of modern architecture is the city's Museum of Contemporary Art or [[Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Castilla y León|MUSAC]].

==History==

===Roman origins===
León was founded in the 1st century BC by the [[Roman legion]] [[Legio VI Victrix|Legio VI ''Victrix'']],<ref Name=Founded>{{cite book |last=Rabanal Alonso |first=Manuel Abilio (coord.) |date=1999 |title=La Historia de León, Vol. 1: Prehistoria y Edad Antigua |url=http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/libro?codigo=515838 |language=es |page=189 |publisher=Universidad de León |isbn=84-7719-817-9 |access-date=18 November 2013}}</ref> which served under [[Caesar Augustus]] during the [[Cantabrian Wars]] (29-19 BC), the final stage of the [[Roman conquest of Hispania]]. In the year 74 AD, the [[Legio VII Gemina|Legio VII ''Gemina'']] —recruited from the [[Hispanic#Terminology|Hispanics]] by [[Galba]] in [[Year of the Four Emperors|69 AD]]— settled in a permanent military camp that was the origin of the city.<ref Name=Founded /> Its modern name, León, is derived from the city's [[Latin]] name ''Castra Legionis''.<ref>[[Antonine Itinerary|Itin. Ant.]] p. 395; {{lang|grc|Λεγίων ζ Γερμανική}}, [[Ptolemy|Ptol.]] ii. 6. § 30</ref>
[[File:Leon 14 museo by-dpc.jpg|thumb|left|2nd century Roman stele found in the city walls]]
The Romans established the site of the city to protect the recently conquered territories of northwestern [[Hispania]] from the [[Astures]] and [[Cantabri]], and to secure the transport of [[gold]] extracted in the province —especially in the huge nearby mines of [[Las Médulas]]— that was taken to Rome through ''Asturica Augusta'' (modern-day [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]]).<ref>Rabanal Alonso 1999, p. 192</ref><ref>[[Dio Cassius|Dion Cass.]] iv. 24; [[Tacitus|Tac.]] ''Hist.'' ii. 11, iii. 25; [[Suetonius|Suet.]] ''Galba'', 10.</ref>

Tacitus calls the legion ''Galbiana'', to distinguish it from the old [[Legio VII Claudia|Legio VII ''Claudia'']], but this appellation is not found on any inscriptions. It appears to have received the appellation of ''Gemina''<ref>Respecting the use of which, and ''Gemella'', see [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] ''B.C.'' iii. 3</ref> on account of its amalgamation by [[Vespasian]] with one of the German legions, probably the [[Legio I Germanica|Legio I ''Germanica'']]. Its full name was Legio VII Gemina Felix. After serving in Pannonia, and in the civil wars, it was settled by Vespasian in Hispania Tarraconensis, to supply the place of the Legio VI ''Victrix'' and [[Legio X Gemina|Legio X ''Gemina'']], two of the three legions ordinarily stationed in the province, but which had been withdrawn to Germany.<ref>Tac. ''Hist.'' ii. 11, 67, 86, iii. 7, 10, 21--25, iv. 39; Inscr. ''ap.'' Gruter, p. 245, no. 2.</ref>

That its regular winter quarters, under later emperors, were at León, we learn from the Itinerary, Ptolemy, and the [[Notitiae Imperii]], as well as from a few inscriptions;<ref>Muratori, p. 2037, no. 8, A.D. 130; p. 335, nos. 2, 3, A.D. 163; p. 336, no. 3, A.D. 167; Gruter, p. 260, no. 1, A.D. 216</ref> but there are numerous inscriptions to prove that a strong detachment of it was stationed at Tarraco (modern [[Tarragona]]), the chief city of the province.

Some elements of the original Roman encampment still survive in the modern city layout. Long sections of the Roman walls (built between the first century BC and the fourth century AD) are still standing. There are also archaeological exhibitions showing remains of the walls, gates, baths and an amphitheatre.

===Middle Ages===
The post-Roman history of the city is largely the history of the Kingdom of León. The station of the legion in the territory of the [[Astures]] grew into an important city, which resisted the attacks of the [[Visigoths]] until AD 586, when it was taken by [[Leovigild]]; and it was one of the few cities which the Visigoths allowed to retain their fortifications.

During the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]], in 715 Tariq advanced from the area of La Rioja towards Astorga and León. The same fortress, which the Romans had built to protect the plain from the incursions of the mountaineers, became the advanced post which covered the mountain, as the last refuge of Cisastur Tribes. However, there is no notice of resistance whatsoever. An attempt was made by the invaders to settle the strongholds with Berbers came in a military capacity, but the scheme was abandoned when the Berbers of northern Iberia rebelled against the Arabs and gave up their positions to join the [[Berber Revolt|revolt]] around 740.

Towards the year 846, a group of [[Mozarabs]] ([[Christianity|Christians]] who did not flee from the Muslims and lived under the Muslim regime) tried to repopulate the city, but a Muslim attack prevented that initiative. In the year 856, under the Christian king [[Ordoño I]], another attempt at repopulation was made and was successful. [[Alfonso III of León]] and [[García I of León]] made León city the capital of the [[Kingdom of León]] and the most important of the [[Christians|Christian]] cities in Iberia.

The seat of the kingdom of Asturias moved to León in 910.

{{See also|Kingdom of León}}

Sacked by [[Almanzor]] in about 987, the city was reconstructed and repopulated by [[Alfonso V of León|Alfonso V]], whose Decree of 1017 regulated its economic life, including the functioning of its markets. León was a way-station for [[pilgrim]]s on the [[Camino de Santiago]] leading to [[Santiago de Compostela]]. With [[Alfonso V of León]] the city had the "''Fueru de Llión''", an important letter of privileges.

In 1188, [[Alfonso IX of León]] gathered the [[three estates]] in the city of León (including representatives of the urban class) in the [[Cortes of León of 1188]]. Due to the written documentary corpus, the 1188 Cortes were recognised by the UNESCO in 2013 as "cradle" of parliamentarism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2013/06/19/castillayleon/1371632533.html|website=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|title=La Unesco reconoce a León como cuna mundial del parlamentarismo|date=19 June 2013|first=María R.|last=Mayor}}</ref>

[[Suburb]]s for traders and artisans sprang up, who, after the 13th century, began to influence the municipal government. During the early [[Middle Ages]], the [[livestock]] industry produced a period of prosperity for the city.

Free from the ''seigneuralisation'' process of the Late Middle Ages, towards the end of the era León had consolidated as one of the 13 cities in the [[Meseta Central|Meseta]] enjoying the right to vote at the Cortes of Castile.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=María|volume=21|year=1999|location=Salamanca|journal=Stvdia Historica.

In the 16th century, economic and [[demography|demographic]] decline set in and continued until the 19th century. For the extent of the [[Early Modern period]] the city remained controlled by a reduced set of noble families by means of the ''[[regimiento]]s'' and ''regidurías''.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://e-revistas.uc3m.es/index.php/REVHISTO/article/view/2766/1501|publisher=[[Universidad Carlos III de Madrid]]|location=G|first=Francisco|last=Arroyo Martín|title=Reseña.

During the 1960s, León experienced much growth due to in-migration from the rural zones of the province.

==Main sights==

=== Churches ===
[[File:Catedral Gótica de León.jpg|thumb|The León Cathedral]]
* [[León Cathedral]], a [[rayonnant]] [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] building. It is one of the most relevant examples of the Gothic style in Spain, almost all of it built from 1205 to 1301. <ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fYH7AQAAQBAJ&q=leon+cathedral+south+tower&pg=PA394 | title=Southern Europe: International Dictionary of Historic Places| isbn=9781134259656| last1=Ring| first1=Trudy| last2=Watson| first2=Noelle| last3=Schellinger| first3=Paul| date=2013-11-05| publisher=Routledge}}</ref> It contains one of the most extensive and best preserved collections of medieval stained glass in Europe, with at least 1,764 square meters of surface, most of it containing the original windows.

*[[Convent of San Marcos, León|Convent of San Marcos]] (currently a luxurious [[Paradores|Parador]]) built from the 16th century AD to the 18th. Its most striking feature is a highly ornamental [[plateresque]] façade.
*Church of ''San Salvador de Palat del Rey'', the most ancient in the city (10th century), however with few remains of the original Pre-Romanesque building. As the name (meaning church of the "Holy Savior of the King's Palace") suggests, it once acted as royal chapel.
*Church of Nuestra Señora del Merdado, from the 11th century.
*[[Church of San Francisco (León)|Church of San Francisco]], an active Catholic church, completed in 1791.
*[[Church of San Juan y San Pedro de Renueva]], dating to 1944–1970, but including an 18th-century Baroque façade taken from the ruined monastery of [[San Pedro de Eslonza]], located about {{convert|22|km|0|abbr=on}} outside the city.

=== Other historical buildings ===
*Roman Walls, built in the 1st century BC and enlarged in the 3rd and 4th centuries AD. Long sections in the Eastern and Northern sides are preserved, as well as less complete parts in the Western side and some remains surrounded by other buildings in the Southern side. Some sections of a Medieval wall built in the 13th and 14th centuries AD also exist in the Southern side. The wall can be visited in specific locations.
*[[Casa Botines]], a [[neogothic]] styled building designed by [[Antoni Gaudí]] and built in 1891-1892 (one of the three Gaudí buildings outside Catalonia).
*[[Palacio de los Guzmanes]], the site of the provincial ''diputación'' (parliament). It contains a patio in the plateresque style by [[Gil de Hontañón]].
[[File:La Casa de los Botines de Antonio Gaudí en León edited.jpg|thumb|right|[[Casa de los Botines]] was built by Antoni Gaudí.]]
*Palacio del Conde Luna (14th century).
*Palacio de los Marqueses de Prado, a 17th-century Baroque building, currently the Hospital Nuestra Señora de Regla.

Its design by the architectural studio [[Mansilla+Tuñón]] was awarded with the 2007 [[European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture]]. One of the building's most distinctive features is its façade formed out of thousands of large multicolored stained-glass panels. Close to the museum is the León Auditorium, also projected by [[Mansilla+Tuñón]], which has an equally striking presence of crisp white cubes perforated by irregularly set windows.
*Museo de León, which contains a collection of prehistorical tools and art from the Roman, Medieval and Modern periods.

==Folklore and customs==
[[File:Genaroylamuerte.jpg|thumb|The burial of ''Genarín'', a satyrical procession remembering the death of a furrier in 1929.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://elviajero.elpais.com/elviajero/2019/04/11/actualidad/1554984027_697565.html|newspaper=[[El País]]|title=Orujo y romances en honor de Genarín|date=11 April 2019 |last1=Marín |first1=Bernardo }}</ref>]]
Leonese customs include the [[Semana Santa]] ("[[Holy Week]]"), featuring numerous [[procession]]s through the centre of the city. One of them is the so-called "Procession of the Meeting", which acts out the meeting of three groups representing [[John the Apostle|Saint John]], the [[Virgin Mary]] and [[Christ]], in the [[esplanade]] in front of the old council. Associated with Semana Santa is the procession called "The Burial of Genarín". ''Genarín'' was an alcoholic beggar who was hit and killed by the first [[garbage truck]] in the city of León in the year 1929.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} This is a celebration of alcohol, and the main purpose of the people who attend it is getting drunk in honor to the alcoholic beggar.

The San Juan and San Pedro festivities are also remarkable, celebrated during the last week of June (between June 23 and June 29). During these days several concerts and festivals take place and the whole city is occupied by [[terrace (stadium)|terrace]]s and [[street market]]s where Leonese people celebrate the beginning of the summer, especially on San Juan's night (June 23) when [[fireworks]] and [[bonfire]]s take place.

[[File:Renfe Alvia train in León, Spain - Flickr - transitpeople.jpg|thumb|[[Alvia]] high-speed train in León]]
===Railway stations===
León has two railway stations, [[León railway station]] on the [[Renfe]] line, and ''León-Matallana'' on the [[Renfe Feve]] lines. There are high-speed services that connect León to Madrid in approximately two hours. Other destinations directly reachable from León are Galicia (to the West), Asturias (to the North) and Valladolid (to the South-East, in the same route as Madrid).

===Public transport===
León has 13 city bus lines, belonging to the company Alesa, a subsidiary of ALSA. Besides the buses, there are plans to introduce tram lines in the city.

==Leonese language==
{{Main|Leonese language}}
[[File:CondeLuna3.jpg|thumb|upright|Palacio del Conde Luna]]

===History===
The Leonese language derives directly from [[Latin]] and developed in the Middle Ages. At this time, Leonese was the official language of the [[Kingdom of León|Leonese Kingdom]] and achieved a high codification grade in the city of Llión.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.unileon.es/dp/dfh/jmr/biblioteca/Aemilianense.pdf |title=Morala, R. (2004): Norma y usos gráficos en la documentacion leonesa. In: Aemilianese I, S. 405-429. |access-date=2011-04-10 |archive-date=2012-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412194655/http://www3.unileon.es/dp/dfh/jmr/biblioteca/Aemilianense.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> The first written text in Leonese was ''Nodicia de Kesos'' (959 or 974); other works in the language include ''Fueru de Llión'', ''Fueru de Salamanca'', ''Fueru Xulgu'', ''Códice d'Alfonsu XI'', ou ''Disputa d'Elena y María'' or ''Llibru d'Alixandre''.<ref>Menéndez Pidal, R. "El Dialecto Leonés". Madrid. 1906</ref>

Leonese is considered a seriously [[endangered language]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/europe_report.html#Leonese |title=UNESCO Red Book on Endangered Languages: Europe |publisher=Helsinki.fi |access-date=2011-04-10}}</ref> It is almost extinct, being known and spoken by only a very few elderly people who live isolated in the mountains of the northern part of the province of León. However, people who wish to separate León from Castile and who support Leonese autonomy are trying to revive the language. León City Council and Leonese language associations like the [[Asociación Cultural de la Llingua Llïonesa El Fueyu]] are promoting its knowledge and use.

Leonese Language Day started in 2006 with the support of Leonese Provincial Government, and from 2008 the celebration is organised by the León City Council.

===Teaching===
At the end of the 1990s, several associations unofficially promoted Leonese language courses. In 2001, the Universidad de León (University of León) created a course for Teachers of Leonese language, and local government developed Leonese language courses for adults. The Leonese Language Teachers and Monitors Association ([[Asociación de Profesores y Monitores de Llingua Llïonesa]]) was created in 2008 and promotes Leonese language activities.

Leonese lessons in schools started in 2008, and it is currently taught in sixteen schools in León city in 2008–2009, promoted by the Leonese Local Government Department for Education. This course is for pupils in their 5th and 6th year of [[primary school]] (11- and 12-year-olds), where Leonese language is taught with Leonese culture.

More than one hundred people are studying Leonese in adult classes in 2008–2009. There are five levels for adults in the official courses developed by the Department for Leonese Culture of the Leonese City Council.<ref>"[http://www.aytoleon.es/web/ActualidadServlet/leon/ayto/actualidad/detallenoticias/index.jsp?comando=getDetalleNoticia&idNoticia=8256&idVideo=&idEncuesta= Cuasi douscientos alunos estudiarán Llingua Llïonesa esti añu]".

==Food==
[[File:Cecina.jpg|right|thumb|[[Cecina (meat)|Cecina]]: Leonese traditional food]]
Within the wide range of [[Leonese cuisine]] the following dishes are the most representative: [[Cecina (meat)|cecina]] (cured, smoked beef meat), [[morcilla]] (a blood sausage), [[botillo]] (a dish of meat-stuffed pork intestine), garlic soup, el [[cocido]] leonés (a mix of meat with vegetables and chickpeas, served after a vegetable-vermicelli soup) and [[mantecadas]] (pastry).
Another very important part of the gastronomy of León are the [[tapas]], which are usually given free with drinks, unlike in the rest of Spain. It is very common to go "de tapas" or "tapear" i.e. to go for a few drinks ("un corto", which is a very small beer, "una caña", which is roughly half a pint of beer or "un vino", a glass of wine, or a “butano”, a small glass of orange soda) just before lunch but more normally as a light form of dinner.
