'''Oakville''' is a town and [[List of municipalities in Ontario#Lower-tier municipalities|lower-tier municipality]] in [[Regional Municipality of Halton|Halton Region]], [[Ontario]], Canada.  It is located on [[Lake Ontario]] between [[Toronto]] and [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]. At its [[2021 Canadian census|2021 census]] the town had a population of 213,759,<ref name=2021census/> with an estimated 233,700 people as of 2024, making it [[List of towns in Ontario|Ontario's largest town]]. Oakville is part of the [[Greater Toronto Area]] and one of the most densely populated areas of Canada. According to the town, about 36% do not have English as their [[First language|mother tongue]], and land available for culture and recreation is over {{cvt|1000000|ft|order=flip}}.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About Oakville |url=https://www.oakville.ca/community-events/community-resources/about-oakville/ |access-date=2024-07-18 |website=www.oakville.ca |language=en}}</ref>

==History==
In 1793, [[Dundas Street]] was surveyed for a military road. In 1805, the [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada]] bought the lands between [[Etobicoke]] and [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] from the indigenous [[Mississaugas]] people, except for the land at the mouths of [[Bronte Creek|Twelve Mile Creek (Bronte Creek)]], [[Sixteen Mile Creek (Halton Region)|Sixteen Mile Creek]], and along the [[Credit River]]. In 1807, British immigrants settled the area surrounding Dundas Street as well as on the shore of [[Lake Ontario]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barclaysquare.ca/about-us/history/|title=History of Oakville|publisher=barclaysquare.ca|access-date=August 14, 2017|archive-date=October 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191020163454/http://www.barclaysquare.ca/about-us/history/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1820, the Crown bought the area surrounding the waterways. The area around the creeks, {{cvt|960|acres|order=flip}}, ceded to the Crown by the Mississaugas,<ref>{{cite web|title=Illustrated Historical Atlas of Halton County (1877)|url=http://www.halinet.on.ca/localhistory/Page.asp?PageID=169|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031206133230/http://www.halinet.on.ca/localhistory/Page.asp?PageID=169|archive-date=December 6, 2003|access-date=2008-05-26|publisher=Waler & Miles}}</ref> was auctioned off to [[William Chisholm (Upper Canada politician)|William Chisholm]] in 1827. He left the development of the area to his son, [[Robert Kerr Chisholm]], and his brother-in-law, Merrick Thomas. Chisholm also formed shipbuilding business in Oakville Navy Street and [[Sixteen Mile Creek (Halton Region)|Sixteen Mile Creek]] and lasted until 1842, but shipbuilding in Oakville lasted into the late 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|title=Oakville Harbour Heritage|url=http://www.oakville.ca/culturerec/harbourheritage-essay3.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208153143/http://www.oakville.ca/culturerec/harbourheritage-essay3.html|archive-date=December 8, 2015|access-date=August 14, 2017|publisher=oakville.ca}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cncphotoalbum.com/archive/cnchistory/history.htm|title=Oakville CN History|publisher=cncphotoalbum.com|access-date=August 14, 2017}}</ref>

The population in 1846 was 1,500. The community shipped large quantities of wheat and lumber via schooners and the railway. There were three churches, a grist mill and saw mill, and various small companies making threshing machines, wagons, watches, saddles, and metal goods. There were also tradesmen of various types.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

Oakville's industries also included shipbuilding. In the 1850s, there was an economic recession and the foundry, the most important industry in town, was closed. Basket-making became a major industry in the town, and the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] was built through it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oakville.ca/culturerec/pioneer-essay5.html|title=Oakville Pioneers|publisher=oakville.ca|access-date=August 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814222520/http://www.oakville.ca/culturerec/pioneer-essay5.html|archive-date=August 14, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1869, the population was 2,000.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/provinceontario00mcevgoog#page/n164/mode/2up|title=Page 343|year=1869|publisher=Robertson & Cook|isbn=9780665094125|access-date=August 17, 2017}}</ref> The community was served by the [[Great Western Railway (Ontario)|Great Western Railway]] and it was a port on Lake Ontario.

The town eventually became industrialized with the opening of [[Citgo|Cities Service Canada]] (later [[British Petroleum Canada|BP Canada]], and now [[Petro Canada]]) and [[Shell Canada]] [[oil refineries]] (both now closed), the [[Procor]] factory (no longer manufacturing), and, most importantly, the [[Ford Motor Company of Canada|Ford Motor Company]]'s Canadian headquarters and [[Oakville Assembly|plant]], all close to the [[Canadian National Railway]] and the Queen Elizabeth Way highway between Toronto and Fort Erie (Buffalo).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lakewoodtravel.com/location/oakville|title=Oaxville Travel|publisher=lakewoodtravel.com|access-date=August 14, 2017}}</ref>

In 1962, the town of Oakville merged with its neighbouring villages ([[Bronte, Ontario|Bronte]], Palermo, Sheridan, and the remainder of [[Trafalgar Township]]) to become the new Town of Oakville, reaching northwards to [[Steeles Avenue]] in [[Milton, Ontario|Milton]]. In 1973, the restructuring of Halton County into Halton Region brought the northern border southwards to just north of the future [[Ontario Highway 407|Highway 407]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oakville.ca/assets/general%20-%20culture%20recreation/GeorgesSquareOakmap.pdf|title=Oakville Boundaries Map Pre 1973|publisher=oakville.ca|access-date=August 17, 2017|archive-date=August 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180809110052/https://www.oakville.ca/assets/general%20-%20culture%20recreation/GeorgesSquareOakmap.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>
