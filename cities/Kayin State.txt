'''Kayin State''' ({{langx|my|ကရင်ပြည်နယ်}}, {{IPA|my|kəjɪ̀ɴ pjìnɛ̀|pron}}; {{langx|kjp|ဖၠုံခါန်ႋကၞင့်|italics=no}}; {{langx|ksw|ကညီကီၢ်စဲၣ်}}, {{IPA|ksw|kɲɔkɔshæ|pron}}), formerly known as '''Karen State''', is a [[Administrative divisions of Myanmar|state]] of [[Myanmar]]. The capital city is [[Hpa-An]], also spelled [[Pa-An]].

The terrain of the state is mountainous; with the [[Dawna Range]] running along the state in a NNW–SSE direction, and the southern end of the [[Karen Hills]] in the northwest.<ref>''The Physical Geography of Southeast Asia'', Avijit Gupta, Oxford University Press, 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-19-924802-5}}</ref> It is bordered by [[Mae Hong Son]], [[Tak Province|Tak]], and [[Kanchanaburi]] provinces of [[Thailand]] to the east; [[Mon State]] and [[Bago Region]] to the west and south; [[Mandalay Region]], [[Shan State]] and [[Kayah State]] to the north.

==History==
The region that forms today's Karen State was part of successive Burmese kingdoms, since the formation of the [[Bagan Empire]] in mid-11th century. During the 13th to 16th centuries, much of the region belonged to the [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom]], while the northern part of the region belonged to [[Taungoo]] (a vassal state of [[Ava Kingdom]]). The region became part of [[Taungoo Dynasty]] and [[Konbaung Dynasty]], from 16th to 19th centuries. The [[British Empire|British]] seized the southern third of today's Karen State (below the [[Salween River]]), after the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] (1824-1826), and the rest after the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]] of 1852.

Towards the end of the British colonial era (1945-1948), the Karen leadership insisted on a separate state covering today's Karen State, much of [[Mon State]] and [[Taninthayi Region]], within the British Empire. They refused to sign the [[Panglong Agreement]] of February 1947, which was the basis for the [[Constitution of Burma#1947 Constitution|1947 Constitution of Burma]], and boycotted the pre-independence elections of April 1947.<ref name=rlf-253>{{cite book | title=The River of Lost Footsteps--Histories of Burma | author=Thant Myint-U | author-link=Thant Myint-U | year=2006 | publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux | isbn=978-0-374-16342-6<!--, 0-374-16342-1--> | pages=253}}</ref> Nonetheless, the constitution granted the Karen a state, though with an area less than what the Karen leadership had asked for from the British. The constitution also guaranteed states with the right to secede from the Union after a period of 10 years. (The Panglong Agreement gave only the Shan and the Kachin a state each; the [[Chin people|Chin]] who actually signed the agreement did not receive a state.) The [[Karen National Union]] (KNU), which dominated the Karen leadership, was not satisfied, and wanted outright independence. In 1949, the KNU raised a rebellion that continues up to today.<ref name=rlf-258>Myint-U, pp. 258-263</ref> The KNU celebrates January 31 as 'revolution day', marking the day they went underground at the battle of [[Insein Township#History|Insein]].

Much of the state has been a battlefield since then. The civilians have taken the brunt of the war. The KNU today forms the world's longest-running resistance. The [[State Peace and Development Council|military government]] purportedly changed the English name of the state to Kayin State from Karen State in 1989.

Since 1976 the KNU has called for a federal system rather than an independent Karen State. In January 2012, Myanmar's military-backed civilian government signed a ceasefire deal with the KNU in Hpa-an, the capital of eastern Kayin State. Aung Min, the Railway Minister, and General Saw Chee Tik of the KNU led the peace talks.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2012-01-12|title=Burma government signs ceasefire with Karen rebels|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16523691|access-date=2021-03-28|archive-date=2021-03-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210320215219/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16523691|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Geography==
Located between latitudes 15° 45' north and 19° 25' north and longitudes 96° 10' east and 98° 28' east. It has a hot and humid climate because of the mountain ranges that lie in its backdrop and its location, which is near the sea, in the tropics. The temperature of the hottest month in eastern mountain regions never falls below {{convert|71.9|F|C|order=flip}}. Lowlands in the west and south of the state are located in the tropical monsoon climate. The lowest annual rainfall in the region is {{convert|120|inch|mm|order=flip}} and the highest is {{convert|190|inch|mm|order=flip}}. The regions get most of the rain in summer. Some of the rivers and creeks in Karen State are flowing from south to north due to the location of the [[Tenasserim Range|mountains]]. The main rivers in the state are Thanlwin ([[Salween River]]), Thaungyin ([[Moei River]]), Gyaing and Attaran.

==Government==
The government of Kayin State is split into three branches: an executive ([[Kayin State Government]]), a legislative ([[Kayin State Hluttaw]]), and a judicial ([[Kayin State High Court]]).

==Administrative divisions==
Karen State consists of one city and nine towns. It has four districts, seven townships and 4092 villages.

Due to the mountainous terrain in Karen State, most villages are small and contain less than 40 households so a large amount of Karen's population is dotted across the countryside over hundreds, if not thousands of villages.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}

On the other hand, community members and local environmental groups have raised concerns about the potential impacts from coal plant emissions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bnionline.net/news/karen-state/item/3236-kayin-state-residents-oppose-coal-fired-power-plant-through-petition.html|title=Kayin State residents oppose coal-fired power plant through petition - Burma News International|last=Shaung/KIC|first=S’Phan|access-date=2017-10-08|language=en-gb|archive-date=2017-10-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008060836/http://bnionline.net/news/karen-state/item/3236-kayin-state-residents-oppose-coal-fired-power-plant-through-petition.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Transport==
Karen State is served by Hpapun Airport and [[Hpa-An Airport]] however they are closed to civilian aircraft.

In 2015, the [[Asian Development Bank]] (ADB) approved a $100&nbsp;million loan to improve a 66.4 km section of road connecting the towns of Eindu and Kawkareik in Kayin state, the missing link of the [[Greater Mekong Subregion]] (GMS) East-West Corridor.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.adb.org/news/adb-loan-help-upgrade-road-kayin-state-gms-corridor-route|title=ADB Loan to Help Upgrade Road in Kayin State on GMS Corridor Route|date=2015-11-12|work=Asian Development Bank|access-date=2017-10-07|language=en|archive-date=2017-10-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007220811/https://www.adb.org/news/adb-loan-help-upgrade-road-kayin-state-gms-corridor-route|url-status=live}}</ref>

Educational opportunities in Myanmar are limited outside the main cities of [[Yangon]] and [[Mandalay]]. It is especially a problem in Karen State where constant fighting between the government and insurgents for over 60 years has produced thousands of refugees and internally displaced people. According to official statistics, less than 10% of primary school students in Karen State reach high school.<ref name=cso-edu>{{cite web|url=http://www.etrademyanmar.com/STATS/s1701.htm |title=Education statistics by level and by State and Division |access-date=2009-04-09 |publisher=Myanmar Central Statistical Organization |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524012235/http://www.etrademyanmar.com/STATS/s1701.htm |archive-date=2008-05-24 }}</ref> All higher education institutions are located in Hpa-An City.

==Health care==
The general state of health care in Myanmar is poor. Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack some basic facilities and equipment.

In general, the health care infrastructure outside of [[Yangon]] and [[Mandalay]] is poor but is especially worse in conflict ridden areas like Karen State. The public health care system in the state is very poor. The following is a summary of the public health care system in the state.<ref name=cso-hosp>{{cite web|url=http://www.etrademyanmar.com/STATS/s0413.htm |title=Hospitals and Dispensaries by State and Division |access-date=2009-04-11 |publisher=Myanmar Central Statistical Organization |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430032618/http://www.etrademyanmar.com/STATS/s0413.htm |archive-date=2011-04-30 }}</ref>
