'''Ouahigouya''' ({{langx|mos|Wayugyã}}) is a city in northern [[Burkina Faso]], situated 182 kilometres northwest of [[Ouagadougou]]. It is the capital of the [[Yatenga Province]] and one of its subdivisions the [[Ouahigouya Department]]. It is also the biggest town in the [[Nord Region (Burkina Faso)|Nord Region]] and the fourth largest city in the country with a population of 124,587 (2019)<ref name=pop/>  
[[File:Ouahigouya BurkinaFaso.JPG|thumb|right|View of Ouahigouya (2005)]]
The city itself has a stadium, a private non-profit Paediatric Hospital with 36 beds for giving birth and 24 beds for children suffering of severe malnutrition, a post office with internet access and at least one Ecobank bank branch.

==History==

The city was founded in 1757 as the capital of [[Yatenga]] one of a number of [[Mossi Kingdoms]].  The city still bears testimony to its role as capital of the Yatenga Kingdom in its name, the meaning of which is ''come and prostrate yourselves''.

In the [[Christmas War]] of 1985, the city's marketplace was bombed by [[Mali]]an forces, almost 100 people being killed.

==Economy==

Mainly of an agriculturally based economy, Ouahigouya also has some commerce and craft industry. The two dams just north and west of the town permit it to pursue some vegetable planting aided by irrigation, such as tomatoes, carrots, onions and mainly potatoes. But as a whole both the region and the city are heavily dependent on rainfall and it is according to it that the population's well-being mostly depends on. [[Millet]] and [[sorghum]] though are the basis of the local diet, much like the surrounding regions.

The small craft industry here is mainly focused on leather and tanneries. The little industry in the region is mostly geared towards gold prospecting, and is carried out by a large company. In terms of commerce, the city takes advantage of its relative ease of access to the country's capital, Ouagadougou, to buy manufactured products and resell to the local economy. This is greatly facilitated by the asphalted road linking the two cities.

==Places of interest==

Features of Ouahigouya include [[Naaba Kango]]'s [[tomb]], the [[Yatenga Naba]]'s compound and an artificial [[lake]].
