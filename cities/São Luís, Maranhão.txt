'''São Luís''' ({{IPA|pt-BR|sɐ̃w luˈis|lang}}; "Saint Louis") is the capital and largest city of the [[Brazilian state]] of [[Maranhão]]. The city is located on [[São Luís Island|Upaon-açu Island]] or [[São Luís island|Ilha de São Luís]], in the [[Baía de São Marcos]] (''Saint Mark's Bay''), an extension of the Atlantic Ocean which forms the estuary of [[Pindaré River|Pindaré]], [[Mearim River|Mearim]], [[Itapecuru River|Itapecuru]] and other rivers. Its coordinates are 2.53° south, 44.30° west. São Luís has the second largest maritime extension within Brazilian states. Its maritime extension is 640&nbsp;km (397 miles). The city proper has a population of some 1,037,775  people (2022 [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] census). The metropolitan area totals 1,536,017, ranked as the [[List of largest cities in Brazil|15th largest in Brazil]].

São Luís, created originally as ''Saint-Louis-de-Maragnan'', is the only Brazilian state capital founded by France (see [[France Équinoxiale]]) and it is one of the three Brazilian state capitals located on islands (the others are [[Vitória, Espírito Santo|Vitória]] and [[Florianópolis]]). The historic center of the city (dating from the 17th century) has its original street plan preserved and was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/821 |title = Historic Centre of São Luís {{!}} UNESCO World Heritage List |publisher = UNESCO |access-date= 20 March 2021}}</ref>

The city has two major [[sea ports]]: [[Terminal Marítimo de Ponta da Madeira|Madeira Port]] and [[Porto do Itaqui|Itaqui Port]], through which a substantial part of Brazil's [[iron ore]], originating from the (pre)-[[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] region, is exported. The city's main industries are [[Metallurgy|metallurgical]] with [[Alcoa|Alumar]], and [[Vale (company)|Vale]]. São Luís is home of the [[Federal University of Maranhão]].

São Luís was the home town of famous Brazilian [[samba]] singer [[Alcione Nazaré|Alcione]], Brazilian writers [[Aluísio Azevedo]], [[Ferreira Gullar]] and [[Josué Montello]], Belgian-naturalised [[soccer]] player [[Luis Oliveira|Luís Oliveira]], and the musician João do Vale, a {{lang|pt|[[Música popular brasileira]]}} (MPB) singer.

== History ==
[[File:AMH-6765-NA View of Sao Luis de Maranhao.jpg|thumb|left|View of São Luís, c. 1665]]
Originally, the town was a large village of the [[Tupinambá people|Tupinambá]] tribe. The first Europeans to settle it were the French, in 1612, who intended to make it the center of a colony named [[Equinoctial France]], under the command of Daniel de la Touche, Seigneur de la Ravardière, and Admiral [[François de Razilly]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Warkentin |first1=Germaine |last2=Podruchny |first2=Carolyn |title=Decentring the Renaissance: Canada and Europe in Multidisciplinary Perspective, 1500-1700 |date=2001 |publisher=University of Toronto Press, 2001 |isbn=9780802081490|pages=387 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cwC9EbJrp7gC&pg=PA103 |access-date=6 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Raymond |first1=Jean-Claude |title=Daniel de la Touche de La Ravardière |url=http://jcraymond.free.fr/Celebrites/R/Ravardiere/Ravardiere.php |website=A la Croisée de l'Anjou, de la Touraine et du Poitou |access-date=6 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200506020642/http://jcraymond.free.fr/Celebrites/R/Ravardiere/Ravardiere.php |archive-date=6 May 2020 |date=2008}}</ref> They built a fort named ''Saint-Louis de Maragnan'' after [[Louis XIII of France|King Louis XIII]] and his Saintly ancestor [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], the construction of which marked the date of foundation of the city, September 8. Portugal conquered the settlement in 1615 in [[Battle of Guaxenduba|the battle of Guaxenduba]] and renamed the city ''São Luís''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bethell |first1=Leslie |title=Colonial Brazil |date=1987 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521349253 |page=168 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gzBHJt4FtC8C |access-date=6 May 2020}}</ref>

Because there had been little time for the [[French invasions in Brazil|French]] to build a city, there is some controversy as to the actual date of the founding of the city, whether by the French or the Portuguese.
[[File:Aerial view of Maranhao.jpg|thumb|left|Panoramic view of São Luís in 1931]]
In November 1641, the city was invaded by the [[Dutch Brazil|Dutch]]. However, they abandoned [[Maranhão]] in 1644.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cardoso |first1=Alírio |title=The conquest of Maranhão and Atlantic disputes in the geopolitics of the Iberian Union (1596-1626) |journal=Revista Brasileira de História |date=2011 |volume=31 |issue=61 |doi=10.1590/S0102-01882011000100016|doi-access=free }}</ref>

In 1677, the city was made the seat of the new [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of São Luís do Maranhão|Roman Catholic Diocese of São Luís do Maranhão]].

Only when those invasions ceased permanently did the colonial government decide to create the state of Grão-Pará e Maranhão, independent from the rest of the country. By that time, the economy was based on agriculture, particularly the exportation of [[sugar cane]], [[Cocoa bean|cacao]] and [[tobacco]]. Conflicts amongst the local elites would lead to the [[Beckman's Revolt]]. This started due to the struggle between Jesuits and landowners, the first against the Indian slavery and the others against the unfair treatment given by the Portuguese authorities; the situation lead to an uprising against the Portuguese, led by the brothers [[Manoel Beckman|Manoel]] and Tomás Beckman and lasted till the intervention of Portuguese troops under the command of the general Gomes Freire de Andrade. After few skirmishes, the rebels were defeated and the Beckman brothers arrested and, after a brief trial, were [[hanged, drawn and quartered]]. The last words of Manuel Beckman at the gallows were "Pelo Povo do Maranhão morro contente" ("By the Maranhão people I die happy"). The phrase decorates the main hall of State Council Building.

Soon after the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], the region started to provide [[cotton]] to [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]]. The wealth generated by this activity was used to modernize the city; to bring religious men to come and teach in its schools; and supplement the water supply. The city came to be the third most populous city in the country. By the end of the 19th century, agriculture was in decay and since then the city's population has been searching for other ways to make a living.

Nowadays{{When|date=January 2024}}, São Luís has the largest and best preserved heritage of colonial Portuguese architecture of all Latin America{{Citation needed|date=September 2024}}. The island is known as the "Island of Love" and as "the Brazilian Athens", due to its many poets and writers, such as [[Sotero dos Reis]], [[Aluísio Azevedo]], [[Graça Aranha]], [[Gonçalves Dias]] (the most famous), [[Josué Montello]], [[Ferreira Gullar]], among others. The city is also known as "the Brazilian Jamaica" because of the popularity of Reggae Music.

The ancestral composition of São Luís, according to an autosomal DNA study, is 42% European, 39% Native American and 19% African.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Genetics and Molecular Biology - Genetic characterization of the population of São Luís, MA, Brazil |journal=Genetics and Molecular Biology |date=March 2005 |volume=28 |pages=22–31 |doi=10.1590/S1415-47572005000100004 |last1=Ferreira |first1=Francileide Lisboa |last2=Leal-Mesquita |first2=Emygdia Rosa |doi-access=free }}</ref>

== Economy ==
Until the mid-nineteenth century, Maranhão's [[economy]] was one of the most prosperous in the country. However, after the Civil War in the United States of America, when it lost space in the export of cotton, the state went into decline. Only after the end of the 1960s did the state begin to receive incentives and emerge from seclusion, by way of road and rail connections with other regions.

In the late eighteenth century, increased international demand for cotton to meet the English textile industry coupled with reduced production because of the Revolutionary War in the United States provided the perfect setting to stimulate cotton production in Maranhão. Shipping companies and Southampton & Company Maranha Maranha Shipping Company, shipping steam, which performed the transportation of cotton from the states of Georgia and Alabama, began operating in St. Louis shaft - London, leading to production of Caxias and Baixada Maranhão. By the early twentieth century, St. Louis still exporting cotton to England by sea, through the lines and Booth Red Cross Line Line (the extended route to Iquitos) and company-Maranha Liverpool Shipping Company.
[[File:São Luís Aérea.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of São Luís Central District.]]
During this golden period of the Maranhão economy São Luís had a lively cultural effervescence. The city had more in common with the European capitals than the other Brazilian cities. It was the first to receive an Italian opera and received the latest news about French literature every week. The rich cotton producers and local businessmen sent their children to study in [[Recife]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Rio de Janeiro]] and as far as Europe.

The opening of the Port of Alumar, [[Port of Itaqui]] and [[Ponta da Madeira|Port of Ponta da Madeira]], currently the second deepest in the world, second only to the Rotterdam, is one of the busiest in the country. It serves as a gateway for industrial production and iron ore arriving from the [[Carajás Railway]], operated by Companhia Vale do Rio Doce and also exports soybeans grown in southern Maranhão and central Brazil, transported by the Carajás Railway and [[North-South Railway (Brazil)|North-South Railway]]. The port's proximity to strategic markets in Europe and North America has led it to become an attractive option for exporting goods, but suffers from increased coastal shipping.

The São Luís economy is based on aluminum processing ([[Alcoa|ALUMAR]]), pelleting industry ([[Vale (company)|VALE]]), food production and tourism. São Luís has the largest GDP in the state, hosting two public universities (and UFMA UEMA) and various educational institutions and private colleges. According to the latest data from the IBGE survey, São Luís has a GDP of R$9,340,944,000.00, occupying 14th position amongst state capitals.

In neighbouring [[Alcântara, Maranhão|Alcântara]] there is the [[Alcântara Space Center]].

[[File:Baía de São Marcos.JPG|thumb|View of São Marcos bay area]]
The island of Upaon-Açu is located between two large estuarine systems that are the bays of São Marcos on the west side and São José on the east in the central region of Golfão Maranhense. The two bays are interconnected in the southwest by the channels of the Strait of Mosquitoes and Strait of Coqueiros (separating the island of Upaon-Açu from the island of Tauá-Mirim).<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://evolvedoc.com.br/xxiisbrh/detalhes-1036_parametros-fisico-quimicos-e-nutrientes-inorganicos-dissolvidos-no-rio-perizesbaia-de-sao-jose-de-ribamar-ilha-de-sao-luis-ma|title=Trabalhos técnicos do XXII SBRH - PARAMETROS FISICO-QUÍMICOS E NUTRIENTES INORGÂNICOS DISSOLVIDOS NO RIO PERIZES/BAIA DE SÃO JOSÉ DE RIBAMAR, ILHA DE SÃO LUIS - MA.|last=www.neopixdesign.com.br|first=Neopix Design |website=evolvedoc.com.br|access-date=2018-06-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180626192255/http://evolvedoc.com.br/xxiisbrh/detalhes-1036_parametros-fisico-quimicos-e-nutrientes-inorganicos-dissolvidos-no-rio-perizesbaia-de-sao-jose-de-ribamar-ilha-de-sao-luis-ma|archive-date=2018-06-26|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the São Marcos bay, the watershed of the [[Mearim River|Mearim river]] and its tributaries flows, while in the São José/Arraial bay the watersheds of the [[Itapecuru River|Itapecuru]] and [[Munim River|Munim rivers]] break. In this region, the amplitude of the [[tide]]s can exceed seven meters. The region presents numerous streams and tidal channels. Several agents have modeled relief such as those of climatic, hydrological and oceanographic origin, as well as intense wind, marine and fluvial activity, with vegetation characterized by remnants of the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonian Forest]], [[Mangrove]]s and Campo de Perizes, an extensive fluvial plain with predominantly herbaceous, located on the mainland.<ref name=":0" />

The climate is characterized as hot, semi-humid, tropical of equatorial zone, with two distinct seasons that go from damp (January to June) the drought (July to December), with average rainfall of 2,200&nbsp;mm per year. Some of the conservation units of the island are: APA das Reentrancias Maranhenses; [[Upaon-Açu/Miritiba/Alto Preguiças Environmental Protection Area|APA of Upaon-Açu-Miritiba-Alto Preguiças]], APA of Itapiracó; APA of the Maracanã Region; and the [[Bacanga State Park]]s, the Jansen Lagoon and the [[Sítio Rangedor State Park|Rangedor]].<ref name=":0" />

On the Strait of Mosquitoes, there are road and railroad bridges linking the mainland to Upaon-Açu Island: the Marcelino Machado bridge, BR-135, composed of two parallel inlet and outlet bridges (456 and 454 meters in length); the metal bridge Benedito Leite, belonging to the [[São Luís-Teresina Railway]]; the duplicate bridge belonging to the Carajás Railway; the metal bridge that supports the Italuís waterway, which carries water from the river Itapecuru to the city of São Luís.<ref name=":0" />

There is also a [[ferry]] service, between São Luís and [[Alcântara, Maranhão|Alcântara]]; and [[Marechal Cunha Machado International Airport|São Luís International Airport]].<ref name=":0" />

The municipality contains part of the {{convert|1,535,310|ha}} [[Upaon-Açu/Miritiba/Alto Preguiças Environmental Protection Area]], created in 1992.<ref>{{citation|ref={{harvid|APA Upaon-Açu/Miritiba/Alto Preguiças – ISA}}|language=pt

The city possesses a short dry season from August to November. During this period when the equatorial rainband associated with the highly seasonalized positioning of the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] is not over the city, warm to hot temperatures and abundant equatorial sunshine prevail. Conversely, the humid, rainy wet season dominates the remaining majority of the year, with abundant cloud cover prevalent and heavy rains falling from January to June, with the heaviest rainfall and highest cloud cover from January to May. The cloudiest month of the year is March with a monthly average of 107.2 hours of bright sunshine throughout the month, while the sunniest month of the year is August with a monthly average of 260.3 hours of sunshine throughout the month. The wettest month is April with an average monthly total of {{convert|476|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} of rain, while the driest month is October with an average total rainfall of {{convert|8|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}.

São Luís is known for its tiles which most buildings in the historical centre are covered in. Because of this the city is also known as "The Tiles City" and "Brazilian Athens".

It also has some cultural peculiarities namely:

=== Tambor de Crioula ===
[[Tambor de Crioula]] is an Afro-Brazilian dance in which gaily clad women court a bateria of tambors (a row of drums). Whirling and gyrating in time to the music they negotiate for prime position in the centre of the bateria. The House of Tambor de Crioula is a museum dedicated to preserving and spreading the cultural manifestation.

=== Tambor de Mina ===
Not to be confused with the above, [[Tambor de Mina]] is the local variant of the Afro-Brazilian religion. [[Casa das Minas]] (Querebentã de Tói Zomadônu or House of Minas), the oldest temple (''terreiro''), which must have been founded in São Luís in the [[1840s]], by African women.

=== Bumba Meu Boi ===
[[File:SGC.ID 7.03-12-2008.Plat-ia 2.jpg|thumb|Theater Artur Azevedo in São Luís.]]
The [[Bumba Meu Boi]] is a popular farce which takes its form as a grand musical pantomime. Practice is a public affair and begins directly after Easter reaching its climax in June when literally hundreds of groups perform on a nightly basis for popular acclaim. Set personalities and characters play out a comedic tragedy with a metaphor for social harmony at its heart. Settlers, the infamous "Coroneis", Indians, spirit workers, African slaves and forest spirits are enacted though costumes, choreography and music - all performed amongst the all-night revelry. The crowd joins in with singing, dancing and dependent on the groups sotaque (or style) the playing of matracas (two wooden blocks, held in each hand and struck together repeatedly). Like the festival of Sao João and its requisite [[Forró]] dance in the North-Eastern states further south Bumba Meu Boi is a harvest festival but with the bull as its centre-piece.

=== Capoeira ===
The São Luís form of [[capoeira]] is said to be akin to the kind of capoeira now recognized as 'traditional bahian capoeira' that predated the Bahian Angola/regional polemic which split the capoeira world in the 1950s.[[File:Fim_de_tarde_no_Palácio_dos_Leões.jpg|thumb|Leões Palace.]]

=== Historical center ===
In 1997 

The Historic Center of São Luís was declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 1997. It differs from other historic centers in Brazil due to the quantity and density of [[Sobrado (architecture)|sobrado]]s, the Portuguese urban town house; the largest collection of exterior [[azulejo]]s in Brazil; and it is a rare example of a Portuguese colonial planned city in Brazil on a grid. Starting in 1989 there has been an extensive program to restore and renovate the colonial era buildings of the city's historical center. Notable examples of historic properties are the [[Catedral de São Luís|Metropolitan Cathedral of Our Lady of Victory]], the [[Church of Pantaleão]], the [[Fort of Santo Antônio da Barra de São Luís]], and the [[Ribeirão Fountain|Ribeirão]] and [[Pedras Fountain|Pedras]] fountains.<ref name="iphan">{{cite web |url=http://portal.iphan.gov.br/pagina/detalhes/34 |title=Centro Histórico de São Luís (MA) |language=pt |publisher=Instituto do Patrimônio Histórico e Artístico Nacional |date=2024 |accessdate=2024-07-19 }}</ref>
