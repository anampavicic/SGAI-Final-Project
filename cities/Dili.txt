'''Dili''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Tetum language|Tetum]]: ''Díli'') is the [[Capital city|capital]] and largest city of [[East Timor]]. It lies on the northern coast of the island of [[Timor]], in a small area of flat land hemmed in by mountains. The climate is tropical, with distinct wet and dry seasons. The city has served as the economic hub and chief port of what is now East Timor since its designation as the capital of [[Portuguese Timor]] in 1769. It also serves as the capital of the [[Dili Municipality]], which includes some rural subdivisions in addition to the urban ones that make up the city itself. Dili's growing population is relatively youthful, being mostly of working age. The local language is [[Tetum language|Tetum]]; however, residents include many internal migrants from other areas of the country.

The initial settlement was situated in what is now the old quarter in the eastern side of the city. Centuries of Portuguese rule were interrupted in [[World War II]], when Dili became the site of [[Battle of Timor|a battle]] between [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] and Japanese forces. The damaged city returned to Portuguese control following the war. In 1975, [[East Timorese civil war|a civil war]] between Timorese political parties broke out, leading to a declaration of independence and a subsequent [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invasion by Indonesia]]. Under [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|Indonesian rule]] infrastructure in the city was developed, with landmarks such as the [[Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Dili|Immaculate Conception Cathedral]] and ''[[Cristo Rei of Dili]]'' being built during this time. The city expanded as its population grew to over 100,000 people.

Resistance to Indonesian rule faced violent repression, and a [[Santa Cruz massacre|massacre in Dili]] led to international pressure culminating in an [[1999 East Timorese independence referendum|independence referendum]]. Following a vote for independence [[1999 East Timorese crisis|violence erupted in the city]], destroying huge amounts of its infrastructure and leading to an exodus of refugees. A period of [[United Nations]] rule followed, during which international agencies began the reconstruction of the city. Dili became the capital of an independent East Timor in 2002. A [[2006 East Timorese crisis|period of violence]] in 2006 saw another period of infrastructure damage and population displacement. In 2009 the government launched the ''City of Peace'' campaign to reduce tensions. As the population has continued to grow and the original site of the city has filled up, the urban area has expanded into coastal areas to the east and west of the main city.

Infrastructure in Dili continues to be developed. The city was the first location in East Timor to see 24 hours of electricity, although its water infrastructure remains relatively limited. Education levels are higher than the national average, and the country's universities are located in the city. An [[Dili Sea Port|international port]] and [[Presidente Nicolau Lobato International Airport|airport]] lie within the city limits. Most economic activity comes from the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sector]] and public employment. To further build the economy, the government is developing the tourism potential of the city, focusing on cultural, environmental, and historical attractions.

In 1769, as Lifau came under the increasing influence of powerful local families collectively known as the [[Topasses]], the Portuguese governor [[António José Teles de Meneses]] moved the administration and 1,200 people east to establish a new capital.<ref name="Berlie2017">{{cite book |last1=Berlie |first1=Jean A. |title=East Timor's Independence, Indonesia and ASEAN |date=1 October 2017 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783319626307 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6EQ4DwAAQBAJ |access-date=15 July 2021 |archive-date=26 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326152317/https://books.google.com/books?id=6EQ4DwAAQBAJ |url-status=live }}</ref>{{rp|4–5}}<ref>{{cite book |last1=Telkamp |first1=Gerard J. |editor1-last=Van Anrooij |editor1-first=Francien |title=Between People and Statistics |date=1979 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-009-8846-0 |page=72 |url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-94-009-8846-0 |chapter=The Economic Structure of an Outpost in the Outer Islands in the Indonesian Archipelago: Portuguese Timor 1850–1975 |chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-009-8846-0_6 |doi=10.1007/978-94-009-8846-0_6 |access-date=2 August 2021 |archive-date=28 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220228142027/https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-94-009-8846-0 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was originally intended that the administration be set up at [[Vemasse Administrative Post]] further east, but perhaps because of the favourable geography, a settlement was established at Dili instead.<ref name="Miranda2015"/>{{rp|17}} This was at the time part of the Motael kingdom, whose leader was friendly with the Portuguese authorities. The governor occupied an existing fortified structure, and with the assistance of the Motael leader began to construct a new settlement. The area surrounding the settlement was [[wetland]]s fed by rivers from the mountains, and proved conducive to [[rice]] cultivation. A wall was built to separate the coastal city from wetlands to its south. The initial settlement was divided between three populations, one mainly Portuguese, one of [[Mestiço]]s and locals from other Portuguese colonies (which became [[Bidau Santana|Bidau]]), and one for troops from a kingdom thought to be in [[Flores]].<ref name="Miranda2015"/>{{rp|25}} 

From 1788 to 1790, a civil war broke out between the governor in Dili and an official based in [[Manatuto]], which was resolved upon the arrival of a new governor. In response to Dutch provocations, a permanent military force was established in 1818.<ref name="Thomaz2017"/>{{rp|210}}  Some Europeans settled in [[Lahane]] to the south, beyond the wetland area. Significant construction was undertaken under governor {{ill|José Maria Marques|de}}, who arrived in 1834 and rebuilt the settlement along a grid. This saw expansion along the coast, but also southwards as the wetlands between the original city and Lahane were [[Channelization (rivers)|channelised]] and drained. A road extended to Lahane and [[Dare, East Timor|Dare]].<ref name="Miranda2015"/>{{rp|17, 25}} The rebuilding saw the settlement being centred on its port, with the immediate port area containing trade facilities, church buildings, military buildings, government buildings, the residence of the governor and his deputy, a residence for a representative of the Motael kingdom, and a residence for the Queen of Manatuto. Of these, only the church and the Finance Deputy's house used [[masonry]]. To the east of this core was Bidau and a Chinese settlement, to the west was the main settlement of the Motael kingdom.<ref name="Miranda2015"/>{{rp|26}}

In 1844 Timor, along with Macau and Solor, was removed from the jurisdiction of [[Portuguese India]], with the three areas becoming a new Portuguese province. A few years later in 1850, [[Portuguese Timor]] was removed from the jurisdiction of the governor of Macau, before being returned to the jurisdiction of Portuguese India in 1856.<ref name="Thomaz2017"/>{{rp|212–215}} When English naturalist and explorer [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] visited in the 1860s, he wrote that the governor's house was "merely a low whitewashed cottage", and that all other buildings appeared to be mud and thatch.

A 1950 census found that the population of Dili was about 6,000 people, half 'civilised' (considered by Portuguese authorities to have sufficiently adopted Portuguese culture), including ''[[Mestiço]]'', 'civilised' natives, Europeans, and other foreigners such as [[Goa]]ns and those from Portugal's African colonies.

Portuguese Timor became a full part of Portugal in 1951, although despite being made citizens of Portugal this did not bring the locals any political power. Governance remained in the control of Lisbon. The Portuguese Overseas Organic Law of 1963 created the first Legislative Council of the territory, which was given some of the powers formerly held by the governor. It also theoretically extended voting rights to the 'uncivilised', although property and tax requirements meant most were still unable to vote.<ref name="Weatherbee1966"/>{{rp|686–687}}

The 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]] in Portugal created immediate change in East Timor, with new political parties forming with the goal of independence from Portugal.

===Growth under UN rule and independence===
Dili continued to grow under UN rule. As Indonesian infrastructure investment outside of Dili was not replicated by the UN government, leaving it to deteriorate, population growth was driven in part due to internal migration from these areas to the city.<ref name="Moxham"/>{{rp|12}} Housing left abandoned by Indonesians in 1999 was occupied by squatters. This was most common in the western areas of the city.<ref name="McWilliam2015"/>{{rp|227}} Most inward migration during this period was from eastern areas of the country.<ref name="Moxham"/>{{rp|18}} Population growth combined with a poor economy led to an increase of urban poverty and unemployment, especially amongst youth.<ref name="Moxham"/>{{rp|12}} This was despite the city reaping 80% of the economic benefits of reconstruction efforts; 65% of direct jobs created by the UN were in Dili, a figure that rose to 80% when including indirect jobs.<ref name="Moxham"/>{{rp|13}}

Following the beginning of UN rule, the population of Dili grew by over 10% annually. This was a result of both rural-urban migration, and a baby boom driven by the country having the highest fertility rate in the world. By 2004, the population had reached 173,541 people,<ref name="Moxham"/>{{rp|13}} with unemployment at 26.9% overall, and 43.4% for men aged 15–29. Around half of employment for these young men was informal.<ref name="Moxham"/>{{rp|14}} In 2005 a new urban master plan was developed by a group based in the Faculty of Architecture of the [[Technical University of Lisbon]].<ref name="Scambary2021"/>{{rp|280–281}} Issues with food security reoccurred periodically throughout the early years of independence.<ref name="Moxham"/>{{rp|15}} From 1990 to 2014, agricultural use of the flat land around Dili is thought to have decreased by around 40%, replaced by [[horticulture]] and [[aquaculture]] in the east and by urban areas in the west. Wetlands have also further decreased, drained and built upon.<ref name="Pinto2016"/>{{rp|274}}

By 2006, Dili produced half of the country's non-oil GDP.<ref name="Moxham"/>{{rp|14}} It was also receiving two-thirds of government expenditure, and 80% of goods and services.<ref name="Moxham"/>{{rp|16}} However, economic benefits were distributed unequally. 1999 saw the end of Indonesian subsidises of core food products, which alongside infrastructure destruction led to rapid inflation. Under UN rule, the use of the US dollar and the purchasing power of international organisations led to price increases. Together, these factors led to extremely high costs of living. Electricity cost four times as much as it did in Indonesia, averaging $15 per household. Telecommunications and petrol similarly grew in price compared to Indonesia. By 2006 Dili had the eighth-highest living costs of any city in Asia, despite the country's having Asia's lowest GDP.<ref name="Moxham"/>{{rp|14}} At this point, the city had around 300 youth groups, some of which were involved in the [[informal economy]].<ref name="Moxham"/>{{rp|15}} These groups, driven by unemployment, were often connected to former guerrillas and current politicians.<ref name="Moxham"/>{{rp|16}} Many developed identities reflecting the regional origins of their members, especially with regards to the broad distinction between those from the east and those from the west.<ref name="Moxham"/>{{rp|18}}

The overall average is {{convert|902|mm|in|2|disp=or}} annually, although there is significant variation between years.<ref name="JICA2016"/>{{rp|2–1}}

Mean temperatures average around {{convert|26|to|28|°C|°F|1}}. This changes by {{convert|10.8|to|13.8|C-change|F-change|1}} throughout the day, from minimums at around {{convert|20|°C|°F|disp=or}} to maximums at over {{convert|33|°C|°F|1|disp=or}}.

Land rights remain complicated and unresolved as a result of the 2006 crisis, with returns of former residents to the capital having been carried out on an ad-hoc basis.

==Administration==
[[File:Sucos Dili.png|thumb|upright|Administration of district Dili (prior to the separation of Atauro)]]
Dili is the administrative centre of the [[Dili Municipality]],<ref name="JICA2011"/>{{rp|2–4}} serving as both the municipal and national capital.<ref name="AdministrativeDivision"/> The municipality has an elected mayor and council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.estatal.gov.tl/English/News/News_7.html |title=MAEOT – News |publisher=Estatal.gov.tl |date=19 February 2009 |access-date=12 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408133644/http://www.estatal.gov.tl/English/News/News_7.html |archive-date=8 April 2015}}</ref> East Timor's municipalities are divided into [[Administrative posts of East Timor|administrative posts]], and each of these is divided into [[Sucos of East Timor|sucos]]. The central city of Dili is spread over four of the six administrative posts within Dili municipality: [[Cristo Rei Administrative Post|Cristo Rei]], [[Dom Aleixo Administrative Post|Dom Aleixo]], [[Nain Feto]], and [[Vera Cruz Administrative Post|Vera Cruz]]. The Hera suco is the easternmost suco of Cristo Rei. [[Tibar]], to the west of the main city, is the easternmost suco of the [[Bazartete Administrative Post]] in the [[Liquiçá Municipality]].<ref name="JICA2016"/>{{rp|2–16, 2–17}}

Each suco has a ''chefe''. Those in Dili have less influence over community land than those elsewhere,<ref name="JICA2016"/>{{rp|3–9}} however their elected status gives them greater authority in other areas.<ref name="ICG2010"/>{{rp|2}} Each also has a head office. Municipal and national government buildings are concentrated in the city centre, mainly in the sucos of Caicori, Colmera, and Gricenfor.<ref name="JICA2016"/>{{rp|3–12, 3–13}} Sucos, administrative posts, and municipalities are all tasked with setting up a Disaster Management Committee. These are responsible for planning, public awareness, and disaster response.<ref name="JICA2016"/>{{rp|5–2}} The borders of sucos, and the aldeias within them, are often undefined. Reasons for this include the history of displacement, and taboo over formal demarcation.<ref name="ICG2010"/>{{rp|12}}

[[Land registration]] is difficult due to the city's tumultuous history, and legal ownership is often unclear.<ref name="JICA2016"/>{{rp|3–8, 3–9}} It is thought that in 1999 existing land records were taken from Dili to Indonesia.<ref name="ICG2010"/>{{rp|4}} The new government attempted to set up a system of rent, charging a small fee of $10 a month for those occupying state property. However, in many cases even this could not be paid.<ref name="ICG2010"/>{{rp|6}} In 2003 the national government legislated that all previous state property, as well as abandoned properties, belonged to the state. It also set up a system of registration based on occupation.<ref name="ICG2010"/>{{rp|5}} Residents can claim land they live in, if there are no objections from others.<ref name="MPW2014"/>{{rp|12}} The 2006 crisis put an end to attempts to enforce rent. Evictions from state property are rare. A cadastral survey began in 2008.<ref name="ICG2010"/>{{rp|6}} As of 2014, 70% of the land in Dili had been surveyed, although this information is not public.<ref name="JICA2016"/>{{rp|3–8, 3–9}} Despite this lack of information, most in the city claim ownership of their homes, with 90% of homes considered owned by an individual or by a family.<ref name="JICA2016"/>{{rp|3–20}} Land valuation is often unclear.<ref name="ICG2010"/>{{rp|9}}

The sucos within the four administrative posts in the Dili Municipality are as follows:<ref name="JICA2016"/>{{rp|2–17}}

It has one runway, which is {{convert|1850|m|ft}} long and {{convert|30|m|ft}} wide, lying {{convert|8|m|ft}} above mean [[sea level]]. A lack of runway lighting prevents night-time landings, so the airport operates from 6&nbsp;am to 6&nbsp;pm.
