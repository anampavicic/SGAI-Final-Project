The [[Oka River|Oka]] is the main river in the oblast's river system. Other rivers include the [[Ugra River (Oka)|Ugra]], the [[Zhizdra River|Zhizdra]], the [[Protva River|Protva]], and the [[Vorya (Ugra)|Vorya]]. Large lakes: [[Lake Bezdon|Bezdon]] and [[Lake Svyatoye (Kaluga Oblast)|Svyatoye]].

===Vegetation===
{{As of|2006|post=,}} the total area occupied by forests is around 1,380,000 ha ({{convert|1380000|ha|sqmi|disp=out}}, 46% of the territory of the oblast). As of the beginning of 2005, agricultural lands occupied an area of 1,350,000 ha ({{convert|1350000|ha|sqmi|disp=out}}, 44% of the territory).

The south of the oblast is sometimes visited by bison that were recently released into the [[Orlovskoye Polesye]] national park. Aquatic fauna includes two kinds of [[lamprey]] and 41 species of [[bony fish]]. The diversity of fish is explained by the variety of habitats.

===Conservation and ecological condition===
According to the governmental report ''On the Status of the Environment and Its Conservation in the Russian Federation'' published by the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Kaluga Oblast is one of the most ecologically pure regions of the Central Federal District. There are several successful eco-settlements: the nature reserve Kaluzhskiye Zaseki, the [[Ugra National Park]], the Tarusa natural reserve, and the Kaluzhski Bor natural sanctuary.

The [[Chernobyl disaster]] resulted in [[radioactive contamination]] in the oblast's south and southwest. Radiation monitoring is conducted in nine districts. The radiation background complies with the established radiation situation.

==History==
The territory of Kaluga Oblast has been inhabited since ancient times. Through the province of Kaluga flows the [[Tarusa (river)|Tarusa]] River, which could give an indication of the history and origin of the Russian people. The oldest human sites discovered by archeologists date back to the [[Mesolithic period]] (10,000–6,000 BC). The first mentions of Kaluga's towns are associated with events in the 12th century, specifically, the feudal war between the Olegovichi and the Monomakhovichi (Kozelsk —  1146, Serensk —  1147, Vorotynsk —  1155, Mosalsk —  1231).<ref name="ко"/>

In the 14th century, Kaluga lands were places of constant confrontations between [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]] and [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Moscow]].<ref name="ко"/> Traditionally, it is considered that Kaluga was established as a frontier settlement to protect the Moscow principality from Lithuania's attacks. Around half of the current province with the western and southern parts and the towns of [[Kozelsk]], [[Mosalsk]], [[Meshchovsk]],<ref>{{cite book|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Słownik geograficzny Królestwa Polskiego i innych krajów słowiańskich, Tom VI|year=1885|language=pl|location=Warszawa|page=262}}</ref> [[Serpeysk]],<ref>{{cite book|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Słownik geograficzny Królestwa Polskiego i innych krajów słowiańskich, Tom X|year=1889|language=pl|location=Warszawa|page=457}}</ref> [[Peremyshl, Russia|Peremyshl]] and [[Vorotynsk, Peremyshlsky District, Kaluga Oblast|Vorotynsk]]<ref>{{cite book|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Słownik geograficzny Królestwa Polskiego i innych krajów słowiańskich, Tom XIII|year=1893|language=pl|location=Warszawa|page=960}}</ref> were part of Lithuania in the late 14th-15th centuries.
[[File:Costumes de Differents Pays, 'Femmes de Kaluga' LACMA M.83.190.240.jpg|thumb|upright|Women from Kaluga Governorate wearing traditional Russian dress]]

Between 1480–1481, Kaluga's territory was the place of the [[Great Stand on the Ugra River]], resulting in the liberation of Russian lands from the [[Tatars|Tatar]] yoke, and Moscow's transformation into a sovereign state.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, with active development of trade and crafts, the city advanced in the arts of wood-carving and jewelry-making. After the reunification of Russia and Ukraine in 1654, Kaluga's role as a trade intermediary between Moscow and Ukraine contributed also to its economic development.

On August 24, 1776, [[Catherine the Great]] issued a decree establishing Kaluga Viceroyalty to unite the Kaluga and Tula Governorates. The center of the viceroyalty acquired a new image. In 1795, during the rule of [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]], the Kaluga Viceroyalty was transformed into a governorate.

During [[World War II]], [[Kozelsk]] housed a Soviet prisoner-of-war camp for Poles, captured during the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] in 1939, who were then murdered in the [[Katyn massacre]] in 1940. In 1941, the territory was captured by [[Nazi Germany]], and then was liberated from German occupation by the Soviet Army's [[10th Army (Soviet Union)|10th]], [[16th Army (Soviet Union)|16th]], [[33rd Army (Soviet Union)|33rd]], [[43rd Army (Soviet Union)|43rd]], [[49th Army|49th]], [[50th Army (Soviet Union)|50th]], and [[61st Army (Soviet Union)|61st Armies]], the [[20th Tank Brigade (Soviet Union)|20th Tank Brigade]], [[1st Air Army]], [[1st Cavalry Corps (Soviet Union)|1st Cavalry Corps]], and the [[Normandie-Niemen|Normandy squadron]].

The modern oblast was founded in accordance with the [[decree]] of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] of the USSR on July 5, 1944. After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Kaluga Oblast became a federal subject of the Russian Federation. In March 1996, the Charter of Kaluga Oblast was adopted.
