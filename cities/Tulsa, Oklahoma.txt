Although Oklahoma was not yet a state during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the Tulsa area saw its share of fighting. The [[Battle of Chusto-Talasah]] took place on the north side of Tulsa and several battles and skirmishes took place in nearby counties. After the War, the tribes signed [[Reconstruction Treaties|Reconstruction treaties]] with the federal government that in some cases required substantial land concessions. In the years after the Civil War and around the turn of the century, the area along the Arkansas River that is now Tulsa was periodically home to or visited by a series of colorful outlaws, including the legendary [[Wild Bunch]], the [[Dalton Gang]], and [[Little Britches (outlaw)|Little Britches]].{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

===Incorporation and "Oil Capital" prosperity===
Around August 1, 1882, the town was almost centered at a location just north of the current Whittier Square, when a construction crew laying out the line of the [[St. Louis-San Francisco Railroad]] chose that spot for a sidetrack.<ref name=Whittier>{{cite web|url= https://tulsaworld.com/news/local/michael-overall-how-whittier-square-could-have-been-the-middle-of-downtown-tulsa/article_f6b38386-4b25-11ed-8572-8bcc0dfa6728.html |title=How Whittier Square could have been the middle of downtown Tulsa |first=Michael |last=Overall |work=Tulsa World |date=October 16, 2022|access-date=November 6, 2022}}</ref>  However, an area merchant persuaded them to move the site further west into the Muscogee Nation, which had friendlier laws for white business owners.<ref name=Whittier/>  On January 18, 1898, Tulsa was officially incorporated and elected [[Edward E.

Tulsa was still a micro town near the banks of the [[Arkansas River]] in 1901 when its first oil well, named Sue Bland No. 1,<ref name="Tulsa County History" /> was established. Much of the oil was discovered on land whose mineral rights were owned by members of the [[Osage Nation]] under a system of headrights. By 1905, the discovery of the grand [[Glenn Pool Oil Reserve]] (located approximately {{Convert|15|mi|sp=us|disp=or}} south of downtown Tulsa and site of the present-day town of [[Glenpool, Oklahoma|Glenpool]]) prompted a rush of entrepreneurs to the area's growing number of oil fields; Tulsa's population swelled to over 140,000 between 1901 and 1930.<ref name="Population of the 100 Largest Cities and Other Urban Places in the United States: 1790 to 1990">{{cite web|date=June 1998 |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027.html |title=Population of the 100 Largest Cities and Other Urban Places in the United States: 1790 to 1990 |first=Campbell |last=Gibson |publisher=United States Census |access-date=April 29, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314031958/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027.html |archive-date=March 14, 2007 }}</ref> Unlike the early settlers of Northeastern Oklahoma, who most frequently migrated from the [[Southern United States|South]] and [[Texas]], many of these new oil-driven settlers came to Tulsa from the commercial centers of the East Coast and lower Midwest. This migration distinguished the city's demographics from neighboring communities (Tulsa has larger and more prominent Catholic and Jewish populations than most Oklahoma cities) and is reflected in the designs of early Tulsa's upscale neighborhoods.

In 2003, the "[[Vision 2025]]" program was approved by voters, to enhance and revitalize Tulsa's infrastructure and tourism industry. The keystone project of the initiative, the [[BOK Center]], was designed to be a home for the city's minor league hockey and arena football teams, as well as a venue for major concerts and conventions.

== Geography ==
Tulsa is located in the northeastern corner of [[Oklahoma]] between the edge of the [[Great Plains]] and the foot of the [[Ozarks]] in a generally forested region of rolling hills. The city touches the eastern extent of the [[Cross Timbers]], an [[ecoregion]] of [[forest]] and [[prairie]] transitioning from the drier plains of the west to the wetter forests of the east.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.uark.edu/misc/xtimber/summary.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908090043/http://www.uark.edu/misc/xtimber/summary.html | archive-date=September 8, 2006 | website=[[University of Arkansas]]| title=The Ancient Cross Timbers| access-date=May 3, 2007}}</ref> With a wetter climate than points westward, Tulsa serves as a gateway to "[[Green Country]]", a popular and official designation for northeast Oklahoma that stems from the region's green vegetation and relatively large number of hills and lakes compared to central and western areas of Oklahoma,<ref>{{cite news | first=Leah | last=Clapman | title=Key Races: Oklahoma Senate | date=September 24, 2004 | publisher=PBS | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/vote2004/key-races/ok_profile.html | access-date=April 30, 2007 | archive-date=June 21, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621224248/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/vote2004/key-races/ok_profile.html | url-status=dead }}</ref> which lie largely in the drier [[Great Plains]] region of the Central United States.

===Topography===
The city developed on both sides of the prominent [[Arkansas River]], which flows in a wide, sandy-bottomed channel. Its flow through Tulsa is controlled by reservoirs at [[Keystone Lake]], and a low-water dam was built at [[Zink Lake]] in downtown Tulsa to maintain a full channel at all times. This dam deteriorated and eventually failed, and was repaired and reopened in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cdm15020.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p16063coll1/id/1681|title=Low-water dam lake to honor Zinks|website=Cdm15020.contentdm.oclo.org|access-date=May 8, 2021|archive-date=October 29, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029183158/http://cdm15020.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p16063coll1/id/1681|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Gretchen |last=Collins |title=River Parks Proves Practical Need for Visionary Ideas |work=Urban Tulsa Weekly |url=http://archives.urbantulsa.com/article.asp?id=11 |access-date=April 30, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928063005/http://archives.urbantulsa.com/article.asp?id=11 |archive-date=September 28, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cityoftulsa.org/zink|title=Zink Lake and Zinc Dam|access-date=September 7, 2024}}</ref>

Heavily wooded and with abundant parks and water areas, the city has several prominent hills, such as "Shadow Mountain" and "[[Turkey Mountain Urban Wilderness Area|Turkey Mountain]]", which create varied terrain, especially in its southern portions. While its central and northern sections are generally flat to gently undulating, the [[Osage Hills]] extension into the northwestern part of the city further varies the landscape. Holmes Peak, north of the city, is the tallest point in the [[Tulsa metro area|Tulsa Metro area]] at 1,360&nbsp;ft (415&nbsp;m)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=22429 |title=Osage County High Point |publisher=Peakbagger.com |date=November 1, 2004 |access-date=June 4, 2013}}</ref> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|186.8|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|182.6|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|4.2|sqmi}} (2.24%) is water.

[[File:Philtower-Building-Tulsa-Oklahoma.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Philtower]], built in the late [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style, is surrounded by contemporary office buildings.]]

A building boom in Tulsa in the early 20th century coincided with the rise of art deco architecture in the United States.<ref name="Art Deco in Tulsa" /> Most commonly in the zigzag and [[Streamline Moderne|streamline]] styles,<ref name="Art Deco in Tulsa" /> the city's art deco is dotted throughout its older neighborhoods, primarily in downtown and midtown. A collection of large art deco structures such as the [[Mid-Continent Tower]], the [[Boston Avenue Methodist Church]], [[Will Rogers High School]], and the [[Philtower]], have attracted events promoting the preservation and architectural interest.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

In addition, the city's early prosperity funded the construction of many elegant Craftsmen, Georgian, storybook, Tudor, Greek Revival, [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]], [[Spanish Revival|Spanish revival]], and colonial revival homes (many of which can be found in Tulsa's uptown and Midtown neighborhoods). Noted architects and firms working in Tulsa during this period include Charles Dilbeck,<ref>{{cite web |title=Charles Dilbeck |url=http://www.preservationdallas.org/resources/discover-dallas/charles-stevens-dilbeck/ |website=preservationdallas.org |access-date=22 May 2019}}</ref> [[John Duncan Forsyth]], and [[Nelle Peters]].

Growth in the twentieth century gave the city a larger base of contemporary architectural styles, including several buildings by famed Tulsa architects [[Bruce Goff]] and [[Adah Robinson]]. The [[Prairie School]] was very influential in Tulsa: [[Barry Byrne]] designed Tulsa's Christ the King Church and, in 1927, [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s midtown Tulsa residential project [[Westhope]] was completed. In particular, the middle of the 20th century brought a wealth of modern architecture to Tulsa. Tulsa's Mies-trained modernist [[Robert Lawton Jones]] designed many buildings in the region, including the Tulsa International Airport.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sisson |first1=Patrick |title=Robert Lawton Jones: Tulsa's ambassador of International Style |url=https://www.curbed.com/2017/8/24/16170780/robert-lawton-jones-midcentury-modern-architect-tulsa-oklahoma |access-date=10 May 2019 |work=Curbed |date=24 August 2017}}</ref> Other noted modernists working in Tulsa include the pioneering Texas architect [[O'Neil Ford]]<ref>{{cite web |title=O'Neil Ford |url=https://larryspeck.com/architects/oneil-ford/ | website=larryspeck.com |access-date=22 May 2019}}</ref> and [[Joseph R. Koberling Jr.]], who had also been active during the art deco period. South, East, and Midtown Tulsa are home to a number of the ranch and Mid-Century Modern homes that reflect Tulsa's prosperous post-war period.

[[File:Tulsa, Oklahoma.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Arkansas River]] marks the division between West Tulsa and other regions of the city.]]

The city's historical residential core lies in an area known as Midtown, containing upscale neighborhoods built in the early 20th century with architecture ranging from art deco to [[Greek Revival]]. The University of Tulsa, the [[Swan Lake (Tulsa)|Swan Lake]] neighborhood, [[Philbrook Museum]], and the upscale shopping districts of [[Utica Square]], Cherry Street, and Brookside are located in this region. A large portion of the city's southern half has developed since the 1970s, containing low-density housing and retail developments. This region, marked by secluded homes and suburban neighborhoods, contains one of the state's largest shopping malls, [[Woodland Hills Mall]], as well as [[Southern Hills Country Club]], and Oral Roberts University. East of Highway 169 and north of 61st street, a diverse racial makeup marks the eastern portions of the city, with large [[Asian people|Asian]] and [[Mexican people|Mexican]] communities and much of the city's manufacturing industry.

Areas of Tulsa west of the Arkansas River are called [[West Tulsa]] and are marked by large parks, wilderness reserves, and large oil refineries. The northern tier of the city is home to [[OSU-Tulsa]], [[Gilcrease Museum]], [[Tulsa International Airport]], the [[Tulsa Zoo]], the [[Tulsa Air and Space Museum]], and the nation's third-largest municipal park, [[Mohawk Park]].<ref name="Mowhawk Park - 3rd Largest">{{cite web| url=http://www.tulsazoo.org/general.asp?id=97| title=Zoo History| publisher=[[Tulsa Zoo and Living Museum]]| access-date=April 15, 2006| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928072514/http://www.tulsazoo.org/general.asp?id=97| archive-date=September 28, 2006| df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Cuisine===
Tulsa restaurants and food trucks offer a number of cuisines, but several cuisines are particularly prominent in its culinary landscape because of its distinctive history.

====BBQ====
Tulsa is known nationally for its barbecue offerings; its barbecue reflects its midpoint location "between pig country and cow country," that is, in the transition zone between the South and the West.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Martino|first1=Justin|title=The Heartland of BBQ|url=http://www.okmag.com/blog/2016/05/26/the-heartland-of-bbq/|access-date=August 14, 2016|work=Oklahoma Magazine|date=May 26, 2016|quote="We’re right in the heartland," says Nick Corcoran, pit master at Burn Co. Barbeque in Tulsa. "We’re right between pig country and cow country, so we get the best of both worlds. We’re also right between Kansas and Texas, two known barbecue meccas as well, so we get a melding of those two pots."|archive-date=August 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807135058/http://www.okmag.com/blog/2016/05/26/the-heartland-of-bbq/|url-status=dead}}</ref> The city's barbecue is also helped by its geography; the wood used in barbecuing is abundant in Northeastern Oklahoma (including [[pecan]], [[oak]], [[hickory]], [[mesquite]] and [[maple]]). The region's ethnic diversity is felt, too: its BBQ traditions bear the influences of white, African-American and American Indian foodways.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Linda D.|title=Barbecue|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entryname=BARBECUE|website=Oklahoma Historical Society|access-date= August 14, 2016}}</ref>
Tulsa is also home to the nationally acclaimed premium smoker manufacturer Hasty-Bake Company. Some Tulsa based barbecue joints have expanded even beyond the state's borders, including Leon's Smoke Shack, [[Rib Crib]] and [[Billy Sims Barbecue]]. The prize-winning [[Oklahoma Joe's]] was founded by Oklahoman Joe Davidson, who mastered his craft at Tulsa's T-Town BBQ Cook-Off.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Vaughn|first1=Daniel|url=http://www.tmbbq.com/interview-joe-davidson-of-oklahoma-joes-bar-b-cue/|title=Texas Monthly BBQ|access-date=August 14, 2016|date=May 28, 2014}}</ref>

Oklahoma barbecue is also unique in its emphasis on hickory-smoked [[barbecue bologna]], nicknamed "Oklahoma tenderloin," and its [[fried okra]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Ardie|title=Barbecue 'Oklahoma Tenderloin' hard to find in KC — that's no baloney|url=http://www.kansascity.com/living/liv-columns-blogs/chow-town/article337138/Barbecue-%E2%80%98Oklahoma-Tenderloin%E2%80%99-hard-to-find-in-KC-%E2%80%94-that%E2%80%99s-no-baloney.html|access-date=August 17, 2016|work=The Kansas City Star|date=January 23, 2014}}</ref>

====Lebanese steakhouses====
Lebanese steakhouses were once numerous in the region stretching from [[Bristow, Oklahoma]] to Tulsa, but now mostly exist in the Tulsa region.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schallner|first1=Nancy|title=Lebanese Steakhouses|url=http://www.tulsagal.net/2010/09/lebanese-steakhouses.html|website=Tulsa Gal|access-date=August 14, 2016}}</ref> These restaurants were founded by [[Syrian Americans|Syrian]] and [[Lebanese Americans|Lebanese]] families who immigrated to Oklahoma before statehood.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gainey|first1=Spencer Livingston|title=BBQ bologna: Oklahoma's legendary Lebanese steakhouses|url=https://nondoc.com/2015/12/08/lebanese-steakhouses-its-just-different/|access-date=August 14, 2016|work=NON DOC|date= December 8, 2015}}</ref>  Traditionally, many of these restaurants had live entertainment (including performers like [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and the [[Ink Spots]]) and featured Mediterranean dishes like [[tabbouleh]], rice [[pilaf]] and [[hummus]] alongside local favorites like smoked BBQ [[Bologna sausage|bologna]].

====Chili and Coney Island hot dogs====
Oklahomans have been consuming chili since well before statehood, owing to the influence of [[Mexican-American]] culture on the state.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Everett|first1=Dianna |title=Chili|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entryname=CHILI|website=Oklahoma Historical Society|access-date=August 14, 2016}}</ref> In 1910, iconic Tulsa restaurant Ike's Chili Parlor opened and Ivan "Ike" Johnson is purported to have acquired his recipe from a Hispanic-Texan named Alex Garcia.

Greek immigrants to Tulsa who came by way of [[Brooklyn]], [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Michigan]] brought with them the tradition of [[Coney Island hot dog|Coney Island-style hot dogs]] with chili on a bun.<ref name="cauthron">{{cite web | url=https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1P2-2179765/one-hot-dog-how-tulsa-became-a-coney-town | title=One Hot Dog: How Tulsa Became a Coney Town | access-date=July 26, 2015 | author=Cauthron, Matt}}</ref>  Today, a related group of [[Greek-American]] families operate Coney restaurants around the city, including [[Coney I-Lander]] which opened in 1926 and was described by food writers [[Jane and Michael Stern]] as perfectly delivering "the cheap-eats ecstasy that is the Coney's soul".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stern|first1=Jane|last2=Stern|first2=Michael|title=500 Things to Eat Before it's Too Late:and the Very Best Places to Eat Them|date=2009|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-547-05907-5}}</ref>  Many of these restaurants sell Greek food, either year round or at Tulsa's annual Greek Holiday, sponsored by Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church (which dates to 1925).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Everett|first1=Dianna |title=HOLY TRINITY GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH (Tulsa).|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=HO019|website=Oklahoma Historical Society|access-date=August 14, 2016}}</ref>

====Southern "homestyle" food====
By and large, Tulsa's traditional cuisine reflects the influence of Southern foodways, particularly "upland South and... Texas where many of Oklahoma's nineteenth-century population originated."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Everett|first1=Dianna|title=State Meal|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=ST023|website=Oklahoma Historical Society|access-date=August 14, 2016}}</ref> The prominence of certain foods reflects the agricultural heritage of the surrounding regions. For instance, at the suggestion of experts at what is now [[Oklahoma State University]], peanuts became a major crop in now eastern Oklahoma as a means for lessening the reliance on cotton cultivation.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Everett|first1=Dianna|title=Peanuts|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=PE002|website=Oklahoma Historical Society|access-date=August 14, 2016}}</ref> [[Chicken-fried steak]] is part of the state meal of Oklahoma and is the signature dish at a number of Tulsa restaurants.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cherry|first1=Scott|last2=Watts|first2=James|title=Where, why and how: 5 great chicken-fried steaks at area eateries|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/food/where-why-and-how-great-chicken-fried-steaks-at-area/article_20e8bb1b-5e10-571d-b64a-cd98aa2561ca.html|access-date=August 14, 2016|work=Tulsa World|date=May 5, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Weaver|first1=Bobby|title=Chicken-Fried Steak|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entryname=CHICKEN-FRIED%20STEAK|website=Oklahoma Historical Society|access-date=August 14, 2016}}</ref>

====Wild onion dinner====
The [[wild onion dinner]] is a festive gathering that originated with the [[Southeastern tribes]] which call Eastern Oklahoma home. The meals often feature [[wild onion]], [[pork]], [[frybread]], [[corn bread]], [[Pokeweed|Poke salad]] and a unique dish known as grape biscuits.<ref>Middleton, Nicole Marshall.

===History of K-12 education===
The [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)|Presbyterian Church (PCUSA)]] established the Presbyterian Mission Day School, a one-story building at what would become the intersection of 4th Street and Boston Avenue in 1884. A second story was soon added to accommodate the number of children who were to attend. This school operated until 1889.<ref name="TPC-Education">Tulsa Preservation Commission Website. "Tulsa History – Education.(1880–1941)". Retrieved December 28, 2010. [http://www.tulsapreservationcommission.org/history/education/]</ref> When Tulsa incorporated in 1899, it took over the school, which became the first public school. James M. Hall and three other men bought the property with their own funds and held the title until the city could reimburse them.<ref name="TPC-Education" /><ref name="Hallobit">{{Cite web|url=https://www.angelfire.com/oh2/fountainofyouth/hall.html|title=J. M. Hall, Father of Tulsa, Obituary 1935|website=Angelfire.com|access-date=May 8, 2021}}</ref>

Tulsa built its first two public schools in 1905. The construction of more schools began accelerating in 1906. In December 1907, control of the public schools passed from the city government to the Tulsa Board of Education.<ref name="TPC-Education" />

[[Tulsa High School]] opened in 1906 on the same block formerly occupied by the Presbyterian mission school, which had been razed. The new school was a three-story cream colored brick building with a dome. The school was accredited by the North Central Association of Schools and Colleges in 1913. It proved too small by 1916, when Tulsa voters approved a bond issue to construct a new high school at Sixth Street and Cincinnati Avenue, which was renamed [[Central High School (Tulsa, Oklahoma)|Central High School]]. The north half of this facility opened in 1917, while the south half opened in 1922.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsacentralalumni.org/central.htm|title=Tulsa Central History|work=tulsacentralalumni.org}}</ref> The building remained in this service until 1976, when it was replaced by a new building on West Edison Street. The old building was taken over by the Public Service Company of Oklahoma.<ref name="TPC-Education" />

===Higher education===

The first institute of higher education was established in Tulsa when Kendall College, a Presbyterian school, moved from [[Muskogee, Oklahoma|Muskogee]] to Tulsa in 1907. In 1920, the school merged with a proposed McFarlin College to become the [[University of Tulsa]] (abbreviated as TU). The McFarlin Library of TU was named for the principal donor of the proposed college, oilman [[Robert M. McFarlin]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}
