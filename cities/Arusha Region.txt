'''Arusha Region''' ({{langx|sw|Mkoa wa Arusha}}) is one of [[Tanzania]]'s 31 administrative [[Regions of Tanzania|regions]] and is located in the northeast of the country. The region's capital and largest city is the city of [[Arusha]]. The region is bordered by [[Kajiado County]] and [[Narok County]] in [[Kenya]] to the north, the [[Kilimanjaro Region]] to the east, the [[Manyara Region|Manyara]] and [[Singida Region|Singida]] Regions to the south, and the [[Mara Region|Mara]] and [[Simiyu Region|Simiyu]] regions to the west. Arusha Region is home to [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]], a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The region is comparable in size to the combined land and water areas of the state of [[Maryland]] in the United States.<ref>{{Convert|32131|km2|abbr=on}} for Maryland at {{cite web| url=https://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0358.pdf| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017210726/http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0358.pdf| url-status=dead| archive-date=17 October 2011| title=Land and Water Area of States and Other Entities| publisher=Bureau of the Census| year=2008| access-date=10 April 2013}}<br />{{Convert|34506|km2|abbr=on}} for Arusha.</ref>

Arusha Region is a tourist destination in Africa and is the hub of the northern Tanzania safari circuit. The national parks and nature reserves in this region include [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]], [[Arusha National Park]], the [[Loliondo Game Controlled Area]], and part of [[Lake Manyara National Park]]. Remains of 600-year-old stone structures are found at [[Engaruka]], just off the dirt road between [[Mto wa Mbu]] and [[Lake Natron]]. With a [[Human Development Index|HDI]] of 0.721, Arusha is among the most developed regions of Tanzania being Tanzania's top 3 most resourceful region.<ref>[http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/thdr2014-main.pdf Economic Transformation for Human Development] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705100113/http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/thdr2014-main.pdf |date=2015-07-05 }}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The "Arusha" Region is named after the [[Arusha people|Arusha People]], a Bantu ethnic group that originally migrated from [[Arusha Chini]] in Kilimanjaro Region around 400 years ago.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Arusha Migration|url=https://ntz.info/gen/n01826.html|url-status=live|access-date=17 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221141756/http://www.ntz.info/gen/n01826.html |archive-date=2007-12-21 }}</ref>

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===
Arusha Region is home to [[Laetoli]] and [[Olduvai Gorge]] national archaeological sites both locations with discoveries of prehistoric [[hominids]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/behavior/footprints/laetoli-footprint-trails|title=Laetoli Footprint Trails|access-date=2021-11-08|archive-date=2021-11-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211108080349/https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/behavior/footprints/laetoli-footprint-trails|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== First Communities ===
The first communities in southwestern Arusha Region's [[Arusha District]], [[Arusha Rural District]] and [[Meru District]], were the now extinct [[Koningo]] people, an ancient [[hunter-gatherer]] group that lived around the slopes of [[Mount Meru (Tanzania)|Mount Meru]] for centuries.

The second community to settle in the region is the Meru People, whom immigrated there from the [[Usambara Mountains]] in [[Tanga Region]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Meru and Machame Migrations to Arusha Region|url=https://ntz.info/gen/n01826.html|url-status=live|access-date=17 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221141756/http://www.ntz.info/gen/n01826.html |archive-date=2007-12-21 }}</ref> They settled on the southeastern slopes of the mountain and started to farm the land. The third wave of settlers were the [[Arusha people]] a subgroup of the [[Pare people]]  migrated from [[Arusha Chini]] in  [[Kilimanjaro Region]]. Some Parakuyo [[Maasai people|Masai]] in the west, who were the last group to immigrate to Arusha Region in the 1830s, assimilated into the Arusha community and influenced the Arusha into adopting the Masai language.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Armies of the nineteenth century: East Africa|author=Peer, Peters|year=2003|publisher=Foundry}}</ref>

In the 1880s a pandemic of [[rinderpest]] killed thousands of cattle and forced a large section of the Masai people in the west and integrated into Arusha agriculturally based society. In southeastern portion of the region in [[Karatu District]]  and southern [[Ngorongoro District]] is the ancestral home to the [[Hadza people|Hadzabe People]], who are the only  surviving hunter gather communities left in the country.

Moreover, most of the Ngorongoro District, [[Monduli District]] and [[Longido District]] of the present area of Arusha Region are home to the [[Maasai people|Maasai]], who immigrated from South Sudan, started moving southward around the 16th century CE toward Kenya, and finally reached the northwestern Arusha Region in the 1830s.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Maasai Origins|url=https://www.worldhistory.org/Maasai_People/|url-status=live|access-date=17 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210501134402/https://www.worldhistory.org/Maasai_People/ |archive-date=2021-05-01 }}</ref>  The Masai were the last precolonial community to settle in the present-day Arusha Region.

=== Colonial period ===
Prior to German arrival in 1895, the years between the 1880s to 1900, Arusha Region was plagued by [[rinderpest]], [[Smallpox]], droughts and famine that came after the devastating plagues.

The first German to visit Arusha territory was Kurt Johannes, and he was antagonistic towards the Arusha people and on occasion he survived an attack that cost the lives of two German missionaries in 1895. On 19 October 1896 he went to visit Chief Matunda and was attacked by Arusha warriors. 
Johannes survived the attack and returned to his post in [[Moshi, Tanzania|Moshi]] and organised [[Chaga people|Chagga]] warriors for a retaliatory attack and defeated the WaArusha on 31 October 1896.<ref>{{Cite web|title=German Invasion of Arusha|url=https://ntz.info/gen/n01826.html|url-status=live|access-date=17 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221141756/http://www.ntz.info/gen/n01826.html |archive-date=2007-12-21 }}</ref>

Johannes then decided to conduct the [[scorched earth]] doctrine on the WaArusha people, leading to a famine and collapse of Arusha society. In 1899, Johannes forced the defeated Arusha warriors to build the German Boma next to today's Arusha Region Headquarters. The Arusha Region was under German military rule and in 1902, one hundred [[Afrikaners]] fleeing the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] in South Africa, are resettled in Arusha by German authorities, with each family given 1,000 hectares of land.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Boers in Arusha|url=https://ntz.info/gen/b00256.html#id01172|url-status=live|access-date=17 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022030745/http://www.ntz.info/gen/b00256.html |archive-date=2007-10-22 }}</ref>

For various reasons, many of the white settlers moved to Kenyan highlands or back to South Africa in a few years before the advent of [[World War I]]. During the great war, the British capture Arusha Region from the Germans in 1916.<ref>{{Cite web|title=British capture Arusha|url=https://ntz.info/gen/b00256.html#id01172|url-status=live|access-date=17 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022030745/http://www.ntz.info/gen/b00256.html |archive-date=2007-10-22 }}</ref> They expelled all the Germans and confiscated their farms and redistributed the farms to Greek and British settlers.

The Meru and Arusha's [[Chaga people|Chagga]] wives were repatriated back to Kilimanjaro. The British started growing coffee in 1920.  The administrative region of Arusha existed in 1922<ref name="Statoids">{{Cite web |url=http://www.statoids.com/utz.html |title="Regions of Tanzania", ''Statoids'' |access-date=2013-01-22 |archive-date=2018-12-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181225065231/http://www.statoids.com/utz.html%20 |url-status=live }}</ref> while mainland Tanzania was a British [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]] under the [[League of Nations]] and known as [[Tanganyika (territory)|Tanganyika]].

=== Post-Independence period ===
In 1966, under the newly independent Tanzanian government, Arusha was given its own regional status.<ref name="Statoids" /> In 2002, [[Manyara Region]] was created and was split from Arusha Region. Portions of the former Arusha Region districts of [[Kiteto]], [[Babati]], [[Mbulu]], [[Hanang]], and a tiny piece of [[Monduli]] were incorporated into the Manyara Region. Arusha was the largest region in Tanzania from 1966 to 2002.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sido.go.tz/file/1676/download?token=VX6jaLf_ |title=PROFILE OF ARUSHA REGION |access-date=2020-08-05 |archive-date=2020-07-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200730011406/http://www.sido.go.tz/file/1676/download?token=VX6jaLf_ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Transportation==
{{Main|Transport in Tanzania}}

===Roads===
The A-23 Arusha-[[Himo, Tanzania|Himo]] road runs east–west and enters the region near [[Kilimanjaro International Airport]]. It connects Arusha with [[Moshi, Tanzania|Moshi]] and then Himo at the Kenyan border. This roads ends at its junction with the A-104 road in the center of Arusha.

[[File:Lake Duluti.jpg|thumb|center|Lake Duluti]]

The A-104 runs northward, to the west of [[Mount Meru]], from Arusha to [[Longido]] and [[Namanga]] at the Kenyan border before continuing to [[Nairobi]]. The A-104 also runs westward past [[Monduli]] to its junction at [[Makuyuni]] with the B-144 road that leads to [[Mto wa Mbu]] and the [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]]. After that, the A-104 curves southward to the east of [[Lake Manyara]] and continues on to [[Babati]] and [[Dodoma]].

Most overland travel is done by bus from the city of Arusha. Within the city and smaller towns, privately owned and operated ''dala-dalas'' ([[Minibus|mini-buses]]) are used.

The region is landlocked, and there are no navigable rivers. The larger lakes in the Rift Valley are not used for transportation. The region is home to [[Lake Eyasi]], [[Lake Natron]], [[Lake Duluti]], [[Lake Empakaai]], and the Momella lakes.
