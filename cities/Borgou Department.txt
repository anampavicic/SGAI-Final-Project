[[File:Borgou communes.png|thumb|200px|[[Communes of Benin|Communes]] of Borgou]]
Borgou is subdivided into eight [[Communes of Benin|communes]], each centered at one of the principal towns: [[Bembèrèkè]], [[Kalalé]], [[N’Dali]], [[Nikki, Benin|Nikki]], [[Parakou]], [[Pèrèrè]], [[Sinendé]] and [[Tchaourou]]. The [[Departments of Benin|department]] of Borgou was bifurcated in 1999, with its northern territory transferred to the newly created [[Alibori Department]].<ref name=UN/>

Benin originally had six administrative regions (''départements''), which have now been bifurcated to make 12. Each of the deconcentrated administrative services (''directions départementales'') of the sectoral ministries takes care of two administrative regions. A law passed in 1999 transformed the ''sous-prefectures'', the lowest level of territorial administration, into local governments.<ref name=UN>{{cite report|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/un/unpan023250.pdf|page=8|title=Republic of Benin, Public Administration and Country profile|access-date=17 November 2016|publisher=Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), United Nations|year=2004|archive-date=22 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181222173156/http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/un/unpan023250.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> Municipalities and communal councils have elected representatives who manage the administration of the regions.
