<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://dataportal.ins.tn/fr/DataAnalysis?SLIyDNUqIUqE3bQE4PQj3Q]</ref>

It is located in the center of a vast agricultural plain occupied by orange orchards of which only a few traces remain. Indeed, during the years 2000 and 2010, urban expansion changed the appearance of the city.
