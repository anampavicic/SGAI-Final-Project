'''Aqaba''' ({{langx|ar|العقبة}} ''al-ʻAqabah'') is one of the [[governorates of Jordan]], located south of [[Amman]], capital of [[Jordan]]. Its capital is [[Aqaba]]. It is the fourth largest governorate in Jordan by area and is ranked 10th by population.

Aqaba, the port at the [[Red Sea]], plays an important role in the economic life of Jordan.  Two of Jordan's top three tourist destinations lie in Aqaba Governorate, [[Wadi Rum]], and the port city of [[Aqaba]]. The port is Jordan's most important import/export hub.  The industrial port lies about 15&nbsp;km to the south from the beaches and the Aqaba city center.

==Geography==
Aqaba Governorate lies in the south western tip of Jordan, it borders [[Ma'an Governorate]] from the east, [[Tafilah Governorate]] from the north, Saudi Arabia from the south, Israel from the west, and the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] from the southwest.  There are two international crossing points in Aqaba Governorate, the [[Durra Border Crossing]] and [[Wadi Araba crossing]].

The Jordanian-[[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] border originally ran a few kilometers south of Aqaba. In 1965 the late King [[Hussein of Jordan|Hussein]] exchanged {{convert|12|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of the valuable coastal strip for areas in the desert.

==History==
[[File:Ljidda.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Lawrence of Arabia]]]]
The city of [[Aqaba]] was inhabited since 4000 BC, it reached its peak during the Roman era, when the Romans constructed the [[Via Traiana Nova]] route that terminates in [[Aqaba]]. Aqaba (known then as Ayla) was also the garrison of the Roman [[Legio X Fretensis|10th Legion of the Sea Strait (Legio X Fretensis)]].

Aqaba was also the site of some of the adventures of [[Sinbad the Sailor]] in the famous Arabian Nights.

In modern history, the city of Aqaba is known for [[Lawrence of Arabia]] and the [[Battle of Aqaba]], one of the key battles in World War I in the Middle East.

The greatest archaeological treasure of the region is [[Petra]]. Petra lies on the eastern slope of [[Mount Hor]] in [[Arabah|Wādī ʻAraba]], a section of the [[Jordan Rift Valley|Rift Valley]] that runs from the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] on the [[Red Sea]] to the [[Dead Sea]].

The oldest script written in Arabic alphabets was found in [[Wadi Rum]] in Aqaba Governorate, and dates back to the 4th century.

==Economy==
The governorate's population depends heavily on tourism as a major source of income. The port of [[Aqaba]] is the only sea port for Jordan. Almost all of Jordan's foreign trade comes through Aqaba. During the Iraqi-Iranian War, Iraq used the port of Aqaba for its foreign trade.

==Administrative divisions==
