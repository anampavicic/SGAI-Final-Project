'''Al Hudaydah''' ({{langx|ar|الْحُدَيْدَة|al-ḥudayda}}), also transliterated as '''Hodeda''', '''Hodeida''', '''Hudaida''' or '''Hodeidah''', is the fourth-largest city in [[Yemen]] and its [[Hudaydah Port|principal port]] on the [[Red Sea]] and it is the centre of [[Al Hudaydah Governorate]]. As of 2023, it has an estimated population of 735,000.<ref name="WP"/>

==History==
In Islamic chronicles, the name Al-Hudaydah was first mentioned in the year 1454/55. The city's importance grew in the 1520s, when the Ottomans took over the Yemeni [[Tihamah|Tihāmah]] region.<ref name="BRIT">{{cite news |publisher=[[britannica]] |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Al-Hudaydah |title=Al-Ḥudaydah |access-date=July 23, 2018 }}</ref>

In the 1830s, Al-Hudaydah was controlled by [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]]'s troops, which turned over its administration to [[Sherif]] Husayn ibn Ali Haydar.<ref>{{cite web |author=Caesar E. Farah |url=https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/5469 |title=Anglo-Ottoman confrontation in Yemen: 1840-49 |website=dergipark.org |page=74 |date= |access-date=}}</ref> In 1849, it became part of the [[Yemen Eyalet]].

The [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] writer [[Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir]] visited Al-Hudaydah on his pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] in 1854, and describes the city in his account of the journey, mentioning that the custom of chewing [[khat]] was prevalent in the city at this time.<ref>{{cite journal |author-last=Ché-Ross|author-first=Raimy |title=Munshi Abdullah's Vogage to Mecca: A Preliminary Introduction and Annotated Translation |journal=Indonesia & the Malay World|date=July 2000 |volume=28 |issue=81 |page=196}}</ref>

During the 19th century, Al-Hudaydah had a large [[Slavery in Yemen|slave]] market. The slaves came from the [[Oromia]] region of modern [[Ethiopia]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Waldmeier |first1=Theophilus |title=The autobiography of Theophilus Waldmeier, missionary : being an account of ten years' life in Abyssinia; and sixteen years in Syria |url=https://archive.org/details/theophiluswaldme00walduoft/page/2/mode/2up |publisher=London : S.W.

[[File:434 A Street in Hodaidah.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A street in Hodaidah in 1893]]
In 1914, during [[World War I]], [[German Empire|Imperial German]] troops led by Major [[Freiherr]] Othmar von Stotzingen established "{{ill|Stotzingen-Mission|de}}", a [[Radio broadcasting|wireless station]], at Al-Hudaydah, which was used during the [[Arab Revolt]] to relay communications from [[Ottoman Constantinople|Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]]) to [[German East Africa]] as well as broadcast [[propaganda]] to [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]], [[Somalis land part of population Northern side]] and [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]].<ref>{{cite book |last = Waugh | first = Sir Telford | year = 1937 | title=Royal Central Asian Journal Volume XXIV part II | page= 313 }}translating the German account given in the German journal, ''Orient Rundschau''</ref>

The city was briefly occupied by Saudi forces during the [[Saudi–Yemeni war (1934)|Saudi–Yemeni war of 1934]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=David Bidwell |title=Dictionary Of Modern Arab History |date=2012 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781136162916 |page=294}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Massimiliano Fiore |title=Anglo-Italian Relations in the Middle East, 1922–1940 |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317180944 |pages=32–3}}</ref>

After a disastrous fire in January 1961 destroyed much of Al-Hudaydah, it was rebuilt, particularly [[Hudaydah Port|the port]] facilities, with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] aid. A highway to [[Sanaa]], the capital, was completed in 1961. The city was also the site of a Soviet naval base in the 1970s and 1980s.

Al-Hudaydah has a large number of historical places, including more than 100 old mosques. It also used to have a university that was as old as [[Al-Azhar University|al-Azhar]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}

On 20 July 2024, during the [[Israel–Hamas war]], the city was the target of an [[Israel]]i [[2024 Israeli strikes on Yemen|air raid]] in response to repeated Houthi attacks against Israel and an attack on [[Tel Aviv]] that resulted in the death of a civilian. The Israeli strike targeted port oil facilities and a power plant, resulting in a large fire killing six and wounding 87. The [[IDF]] claimed that they targeted military facilities.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Israel says it struck Yemen’s Hodeidah in response to Houthi attacks |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/20/air-raids-hit-yemens |access-date=2024-07-20 |website=Al Jazeera |language=en}}</ref>

==Economy==
Situated on the [[Red Sea]], Al-Hudaydah is an important port, exporting coffee, cotton, [[Phoenix dactylifera|dates]] and [[Hide (skin)|hides]]. It was developed as a seaport in the mid-19th century by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]]. As of June 2018, three quarters of humanitarian and commercial cargo entering Yemen arrived via [[Hudaydah Port|the port of Hudaydah]].<ref name="wsj">{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-deepens-role-in-yemen-fight-offers-gulf-allies-airstrike-target-assistance-1528830371 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20180613000241/https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-deepens-role-in-yemen-fight-offers-gulf-allies-airstrike-target-assistance-1528830371 |archive-date=June 13, 2018 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |first=Dion |last=Nissenbam |title=U.S. Deepens Role in Yemen Fight, Offers Gulf Allies Airstrike-Target Assistance |access-date=June 13, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> It serves as the entry point for Yemen's [[humanitarian aid]] and around 70% of commercial imports.<ref>{{Cite news| last1 = Hasson| first1 = Nir| last2 = Khoury| first2 = Jack| title = Israeli Panel Approves 640 New Settler Homes in East Jerusalem| work = Haaretz| access-date = 2018-11-08| date = 2018-11-07| url = https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israeli-panel-approves-640-new-settler-homes-in-east-jerusalem-1.6633141}}</ref>  The port of Ras Isa is slightly north of Al Hudaydah proper, and is the terminus of the [[Marib–Ras Isa oil pipeline]] from inland Yemen, with a major storage and offloading vessel named [[FSO Safer|FSO ''Safer'']] moored offshore, though idled since the beginning of the Yemeni Civil War in 2015.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://worldmaritimenews.com/archives/288102/report-houthis-seeking-help-to-prevent-massive-oil-spill-off-yemen-from-leaking-fso/ | title=Report: Houthis Seeking Help to Prevent Massive Oil Spill off Yemen from Leaking FSO | publisher=World Maritime News | date=17 December 2019 | access-date=19 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/23/yemen-deserted-tanker-holding-over-1m-oil-barrels-explode | title=Experts fear deserted oil tanker off Yemen could explode | work=The Guardian | date=23 July 2019 | access-date=19 December 2019}}</ref>

In 1920, the British described Al Hudaydah's port as being a "poor harbour." With two entrances, it was only able to provide adequate storage and shelter for small boats, with larger boats and ships having to dock over two miles away. In 1908, a new pier was built, which had trouble with depth, leading most imported items to be dumped on the beach instead of delivered by dock. Coal was often available for visiting vessels. A new harbour was built 10 miles northwest of the town by the [[Ottoman government]], with a small train line leading to Al Hudaydah, and connected to the Sana-Hodeida Railway. A French company built the rail system, which was halted upon the [[Italo-Turkish War]] breakout. In 1909, the port was bringing in less than the port at [[Jeddah]]. That year, 172 [[steam ships]] visited the port. The majority of the goods were from the [[United Kingdom]], followed by [[Italy]], [[Russia]] and [[Germany]]. German imports had grown from 1905 to 1909, with British shipping declining.<ref name=Prothero70>{{cite book |last=Prothero|first=G.W. |title=Arabia |year=1920 |publisher=H.M.

Stationery Office |location=London |page=99 |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11767/view/1/99/}}</ref>

The city was known for producing striped coarse cotton cloth, woven by hand. The artisans making the cloth were relocated to Al Hudaydah from [[Zabīd]] and Beit el-Faki due to tribal conflict.<ref name="Prothero99"/> The city was also a centre for [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] and [[sandal]] making.<ref name="Prothero99"/>

In the late 19th century, Al-Hudaydah was a major exporter of [[coffee]], although its export business shifted to [[Aden]] in the early 20th century due to more secure routes there. Al-Hudaydah had to transport its goods through [[Yemen]] and Indian ports for security reasons, making export to the United Kingdom troublesome. During this time period, the region imported cereal and rice from India, cotton from [[Manchester]], England and the United States, iron and steel from Germany, and general goods from Italy and [[Austria]]. As of 1920, the city was exporting [[fuller's earth]], hides, and coffee.<ref name=Prothero70/> The coffee produced in Al-Hudaydah was considered some of the finest in the region.<ref name=Prothero83>{{cite book |last=Prothero|first=G.W. |title=Arabia |year=1920 |publisher=H.M.

==Yemeni civil war==

The [[Hudaydah Port]] plays a crucial role in allowing food to be imported into the country. This role has been disrupted several times over the course of the [[Yemeni civil war (2014–present)|Yemeni civil war]].

In June 2018, pro-Hadi government forces with the backing of the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] entered the port, in an effort to dislodge [[Houthi movement|Houthi]] forces.<ref name="wsj"/><ref name="wsj2">{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/yemeni-forces-backed-by-saudi-led-coalition-launch-assault-on-countrys-main-port-1528870659 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20180613182724/https://www.wsj.com/articles/yemeni-forces-backed-by-saudi-led-coalition-launch-assault-on-countrys-main-port-1528870659 |archive-date=13 June 2018 |title=Yemeni Forces, Backed by Saudi-Led Coalition, Launch Assault on Country's Main Port |first1=Dion |last1=Nissenbaum |first2=Margherita |last2=Stancati |date=13 June 2018 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |access-date=20 June 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Due to the risk of a humanitarian crisis if the port is besieged, the [[United Nations]] attempted to secure an agreement with the Houthis to place the port under UN control, but was unsuccessful until 13 December 2018, on which date there was an announcement by UN Secretary-General [[António Guterres]] that the two sides to the civil war have reached an agreement on a ceasefire.<ref name="wsj"/><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-46555059 |title=Truce breakthrough in Yemen talks |work=BBC News |date=December 13, 2018 |access-date=}}</ref>

== Topography == 

Al-Hudaydah is generally composed of a flat plain that gently slopes towards the sea. The elevated areas consist mainly of small sand dunes or remnants of inland masses. Geologically, this coastal plain is part of the Red Sea rift valley, covered by recent deposits, which can be divided into two categories, though it’s difficult to distinguish their boundaries. Near the Red Sea coast, the deposits are primarily marine formations from the late Tertiary and Quaternary periods, covered by modern wind-blown sand deposits. In contrast, near the foothills of the mountains, deltaic deposits are found, some of which are coarse, consisting of large gravel and rock fragments, while others are finer particles carried by streams descending from the mountains. These coarse deltaic deposits gradually disappear under sand deposits, and at the boundary between the two, freshwater springs emerge.

The province's surface can be divided into three sections:

Coastal Plains: The majority of Al-Hudaydah’s land lies within the Tihama coastal plain, which stretches from Al-Luhayyah in the north to Al-Khawkhah in the south, spanning approximately 300 kilometers in length and 60 to 150 kilometers in width. This plain is traversed by several valleys, which are outlets for flood and rainwater flowing from the internal highlands of the province and from the highlands and mountains of the neighboring provinces of Ibb, Dhamar, Sana'a, Al-Mahwit, and Hajjah, eventually emptying into the Red Sea. Major valleys include, Wadi Mour, Wadi Siham, Wadi Zabid, among others.

Mountain Highlands: Notable mountains include Jabal Ras and Jabal Bura, both reaching elevations of 2,000 to 2,400 meters above sea level.

Islands: There are over 40 Yemeni islands in the Red Sea off the coast of Al-Hudaydah, with notable ones being [[Kamaran]],[[Hanish Islands]], and Taqfash Island.<ref>https://yemen-nic.info/gover/hodiada/brife/</ref>

==Climate==
Al Hudaydah has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''BWh'').
