Studies by the [[Fundação Getulio Vargas|Getulio Vargas Foundation]] in June 2011 classified Niterói as the richest city of Brazil, with 55.7% of the population included in class A. Considering the classes A and B, Niterói also appears in the first place, with 85.9% of the population in these classes. According to 2010 data from [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]], Niterói's nominal gross domestic product was 11.2 billion reais, being the fifth municipality with the highest gross domestic product of the state. The city is the second largest formal employer in the state of Rio de Janeiro, although it occupies the 5th place in terms of the number of inhabitants. The city is one of the main financial, commercial and industrial centers in the state of Rio de Janeiro, being the 12th among the 100 best Brazilian cities to do business.

Niterói was founded on 22 November 1573 by the [[Tupi people|Tupi]] chief [[Arariboia]], who later was forcibly converted to Roman Catholicism and was given the Christian name of Martim Afonso, after the Portuguese explorer [[Martim Afonso de Sousa]], making it the only Brazilian city to have been founded by a non-Christian, non-assimilated [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|indigenous person]].<ref name="origin">{{cite web | url = http://www.cdp-fan.niteroi.rj.gov.br/niteroi.htm | title = The Niterói Secretary of Culture's official website | access-date = 2007-02-25 | publisher = Niterói City Hall | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070614171215/http://www.cdp-fan.niteroi.rj.gov.br/niteroi.htm | archive-date = 14 June 2007 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

"Niterói" is a term of Tupi origin, with "{{lang|tpn|Nheterõîa|italic=no}}" being its recorded form in the ''{{interlanguage link|Vocabulary in the Brasílica Language|WD=Q116447893|s=1}}'' ({{lang|pt|Vocabulário na língua brasílica}}), a dictionary of the [[Tupi language]] compiled at the end of the 16th century. According to {{interlanguage link|Frederico Edelweiss|pt}}, this term would mean "the (bay) all sinuous", through the composition of {{lang|tpn|nhe-}}, a reflexive pronoun, {{lang|tpn|terõ}}, "sinuous" (a term recorded by [[Antonio Ruiz de Montoya]] in his {{lang|es|[[Tesoro de la lengua guaraní]]}}), and {{lang|tpn|îá}}, a particle that indicates a customary trait. Edelweiss reinforces this hypothesis through the poem ''[[De Gestis Mendi de Saa]]'', which calls Rio de Janeiro a "sinuous port" twice, and he suggests that this designation reveals Tupi influence.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Edelweiss|first=Frederico|date=1967|title=Os topônimos indígenas do Rio de Janeiro quinhentista|trans-title=The indigenous toponyms of 16th-century Rio de Janeiro|journal=[[Revista do Instituto Histórico e Geográfico Brasileiro]]|language=Portuguese|location=Rio de Janeiro|volume=275|pages=114–117|issn=0101-4366}}</ref><!-- Portuguese: Os termos tupis foram atualizados conforme a grafia adotada por Eduardo de Almeida Navarro (acento circunflexo para semivogais, a título de exemplo). -->

In the year 1555, French navigator [[Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon]] allied himself with the [[Tupinambá people|Tupinambas Indians]] who dominated the Guanabara Bay and instituted a French colony in the region, [[France Antarctique]]. The region was avoided by the Portuguese because of the hostility of the Tupinamba. The region developed under the command of Villegaignon, who planned to build a city in the region. After a while, Calvinists who had emigrated from France to the colony returned to France, where they accused Villegaignon of prejudice against Protestants and of maladministration. The French navigator had to return to France to explain himself.

Following the absence of the French leader, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] crown began noticing that the [[Guanabara Bay|bay of Rio de Janeiro]] would make a strategic scale for the Atlantic route of ships from [[Portugal]] to its colonies in Africa and Asia, as well an important advanced bridgehead for the defense of South Brazil. Fortresses were built and an alliance was formed with nearby native [[Tupi people|Tupi-Guaraní]] tribes to defend the settlement against other European invaders. Then, in 1560, the Portuguese leader [[Mem de Sá]] attacked and destroyed the French fort that was located in Guanabara Bay, Coligny Fort, without, however, being able to definitively expel the French from the region. [[Estácio de Sá]], Mem de Sá's nephew, who would continue to command the war, enlisted the help of the head of the Temiminos Indians, [[Arariboia]], who accepted the governor's request to help the Portuguese expel the French from the Guanabara Bay, in the hope to regain the mother island.

With the end of the war in 1567, Estácio de Sá invoked Arariboia and the [[Tupi people|Temininós]] Indians to occupy the right side of the entrance to the Guanabara Bay, opposite the city of [[Rio de Janeiro|São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro]] founded by Estácio in 1565, as previously requested by Arariboia a tract of land. Thus, the entrance to the bay would be fully protected from intrusion. The place to be occupied by Arariboia was known as "Banda D'Além" (the land beyond), in the eastern side of the bay, from ''River Marui'' to the ''Red Barriers'' between ''Gragoata'' and ''Boa Viagem'' beaches.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cdp-fan.niteroi.rj.gov.br/niteroi.htm |title=Conheça Niterói (Know Niterói) |access-date=25 February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614171215/http://www.cdp-fan.niteroi.rj.gov.br/niteroi.htm |archive-date=14 June 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This area corresponded to what is nowadays the northwestern part of the municipality of Niterói, which includes the central and northern zones of its urban area. There, in the "Land Beyond", Arariboia founded the Town of Saint Lawrence of the Indians (in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''Vila de São Lourenço dos Índios''), the embryo for the future city of ''Niterói'', a Tupi name that means "Hidden Waters".

===Imperial era===
[[File:Hospital Maritimo de Sta. Isabel Jurujuba, da Coleção Brasiliana Iconográfica.jpg|thumb|left|270px|St. Isabel Maritime Hospital in [[Jurujuba]] area, 1853]]
The village was visited by the [[List of Brazilian monarchs|King of Brazil]], [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]], in 1816, who also decreed its emancipation from [[Rio de Janeiro]] on 10 May 1819 and gave the new-created municipality a new name, ''Vila Real da Praia Grande'' (Royal Town of Great Beach).

In [[1834]], the city of Rio de Janeiro, capital of the newly established [[Empire of Brazil]], was detached from the rest of [[Rio de Janeiro Province]]; Vila Real da Praia Grande was then chosen as the new capital of that province, while the city of Rio de Janeiro itself was converted into a ''[[neutral municipality]]'', following the [[Ato Adicional]]. Niterói served the function of capital until the year of [[1975]] – except for the period between [[1894]] and [[1903]] when it was temporarily transferred to the city of [[Petrópolis]].

Vila Real da Praia Grande was officially renamed ''Nictheroy'' ([[Tupian language|Tupi]] for "hidden waters") on 6 March [[1835]]. This old spelling persisted until the mid-20th century, when the current spelling–[http://www.soumaisniteroi.com.br Niterói]–was adopted. The capital condition has brought a number of urban developments such as the steam boat, public lighting to whale oil, water supply and new means of transport to connect the city to the interior of the province. Nine years later, the Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|D. Pedro II]] granted the city of Niterói the title of [[:pt:Imperial Cidade|Imperial City]]. The appointment was given to the most important cities, giving them some autonomy and regional power.

At the end of the 19th century, around [[1885]], some tram systems were founded, which allowed the expansion of the city to Icaraí, Ponta d'Areia and [[Itaipu, Niterói|Itaipu]] districts.

===Republican era===
[[File:Alameda em 1909.JPG|thumb|left|270px|Alameda São Boaventura in Fonseca area, 1909]]
In 1890, the Brazilian provinces began being called states and the neutral municipality (Rio de Janeiro city) had its status changed to ''Federal District'' (or simply '''DF''', the Portuguese acronym for ''Distrito Federal'').

The monarchist [[Revolta da Armada|navy revolt]] in [[1893]] damaged productive activities and forced the transfer of the capital's headquarters to [[Petrópolis]]. In [[1903]], Niterói returned to be the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro. This brought about a new impulse to modernize the city with the construction of squares, decks, parks, waterway station and sewage network, as well as widening of the streets and main avenues.

A [[Niterói circus fire|circus fire]] in the city killed 323 people on 17 December 1961; the fire was later found to have been deliberately set by disgruntled circus employees. It is one of the worst tragedies in Brazilian history and the most fatal in the annals of world circus show history.

Following the transference of Brazil's capital to [[Brasília]] in 1960, the city of Rio de Janeiro became a [[city-state]] named [[Guanabara (state)|Guanabara]]. This state was merged with Rio de Janeiro State in 1975; since then, Niterói lost its condition of the state's capital in favor of the [[city of Rio de Janeiro]].

On 8 April 2010; the mudslide triggered due to heavy rainfall cost at least 200 lives. At least 11,000 people were forced to flee homes due to further mudslides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2010/04/2010491715201125.html |title=Fears Rio mudslide toll could soar – Americas |publisher=Al Jazeera |access-date=2013-03-26}}</ref>

==Geography==
Niterói has an area of 129,375 square kilometers located between the [[Guanabara Bay]] (west), the [[Atlantic Ocean]] (south), [[Maricá]] (east) and [[São Gonçalo, Rio de Janeiro|São Gonçalo]] (north).

There are a number of beaches in the area, including Praia de Fora and Praia do Imbuí, with their historical values; Piratininga Beach, Camboinhas Beach, Itaipu Beach and Itacoatiara Beach, the most visited;{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Praia do Sossego, Praia Adam and Eve and Prainha. It has two saltwater lagoons: Piratininga and Itaipu. The first is linked to the second by means of the Camboatá Canal, opened by the National Department of Sanitation Works in 1946. The Itaipu Lagoon, in turn, connects to the sea through the Itaipu Canal, which was built in 1979.

The relief consists of crystalline terrains, divided into massifs and coastal hills. The massifs predominate in the south and form the mountains of Malheiro, Calaboca and Tiririca, where is the Stone of the Elephant, the highest point of the municipality, 412m high.

The coastal plains are composed of sediments, obviously located near the sea. The most extensive area covers the entire area of Piratininga and Itaipu lagoons.

===Climate===
Niterói has a [[tropical climate]], specifically a [[tropical monsoon climate]], with warm to hot temperatures year round as well as relatively frequent rainfall.

==Politics==
[[File:Câmara Municipal da Cidade de Niterói-RJ.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Niterói city council]]
In Niterói, executive power is represented by the mayor and cabinet of secretaries, in accordance with the model proposed by the [[Brazilian Constitution|Federal Constitution]]. The Organic Law of the Municipality and the current Master Plan, however, prescribe that the public administration should give the population effective tools to exercise participatory democracy. Thus, the city is divided into regional secretariats (although it has already been divided into regional administrations), each headed by a secretary appointed by the mayor.

The legislative power is constituted to the Municipality of Niterói (CMN), composed of 21 elected councilors for mandates of four years (in compliance with the provisions of Article 29 of the Federal Constitution, which governs a minimum and maximum number for municipalities according to with number of inhabitants). It is up to the house to draft and vote fundamental laws to the administration and to the Executive, especially the participative budget (Budgetary Guidelines Law).

The current mayor of Niterói is [[Axel Grael]] of the [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|Democratic Labour Party]], who was elected in 2020 amidst the ongoing [[COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil|coronavirus pandemic]] in Brazil; he was ex-mayor [[Rodrigo Neves]]' deputy for the 2012–2016 term and Secretary of Planning during the 2017–2020 term.<ref>[https://oglobo.globo.com/rio/bairros/principais-desafios-sao-superar-covid-retomar-economia-empregos-diz-axel-grael-prefeito-eleito-de-niteroi-24755790 O Globo]</ref>

==Economy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2023}}
Niteroi is one most important financial and commercial centers in Rio de Janeiro State, like a modern city, with modern buildings and several shopping malls. Its economy is centered on its trading and commerce services, like real-estate corporations, [[graphic design]], [[web design]] and publicity.
It also hosts industries of food (especially seafood), clothes, candles, and [[marine (ocean)|marine objects]].

The city is located 25 minutes away from [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s downtown region. Niterói boasts the title of fourth richest city in Rio de Janeiro State, and the third in the [[Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Area]].
The [[Niterói Contemporary Art Museum]], the city's main landmark, was designed by the famous Brazilian [[modernist]] architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]]. The landscape of the central urban area of the city is dominated by the Niterói Tower, a tall cylindrical office building belonging to the Niterói Shopping Mall.

===Growth===
By the time of its emancipation, the urban area of Niteroi corresponded to its central zone and São Domingos only. The south zone – Icarai, Santa Rosa, Vital Brazil – began to be urbanized in 1841, when the Santa Rosa farm was divided into estates, while Jurujuba evolved from an old fishermen colony. São Francisco and Charitas, sites named after the Catholic Church built in honor to Saint Francis by the Jurujuba cove, remained sparsely populated until about 1940. As for the northern zone of Niteroi, its urbanization began in the late 19th century, when a [[rail transport|tramway]] was inaugurated, allowing the expansion of the city to north and northeast, as well boosting the urban growth of the neighbouring municipality of São Gonçalo.

The realm of Itaipu – a former vast zone of farming lands and forests east of Niteroi – was annexed to the municipality in 1943. It has lost its countryside traits and its urban population has grown fast since the late 1960s.

In the early 20th century, Niteroi started its industrialization boom.

{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2023}}

===Bus===
The urban bus service is the only means of public transportation in the city of Niterói. There are just under fifty active lines, all operated by private companies. Most municipal bus lines have an end point in the center of Niterói (at the João Goulart Bus Terminal), or they pass through the center of Niterói.

===Ferry===
[[File:Niteroi01.jpg|thumb|240px|Arariboia ferry station in Niterói]]
The sea crossing between Niterói and the city of Rio de Janeiro is made by two routes, both having as destination the [[Praça Quinze de Novembro|Praça XV]] Station. The stations, in Niterói, are located in Arariboia Square, in the center and in the [[Charitas]] neighborhood. The crossing between ''Praça Arariboia'' and ''Praça 15 de Novembro'' is done by large boats, with capacity for up to 2,000 passengers, in a journey that lasts about twenty minutes.

Since 2006, the boats have been gradually replaced by large catamarans with a lower capacity (up to 1,200 passengers), but with a shorter crossing time of between 12 and 15 minutes. The crossing between the station of Charitas and that of the ''Praça 15 de Novembro''× is done by small catamarans, being this service considered selective transport.

===Train===
There was a railway extension for passenger transportation, 33&nbsp;km long, connecting Niterói to the municipality of [[Itaboraí]], passing through [[São Gonçalo, Rio de Janeiro|São Gonçalo]]. Until its deactivation in 2007 the extension was operated by the state-owned company Central. In the end, there were only two daily trips, one in each direction, using an obsolete train of the 1950s. The line is now deactivated and in several sections, the tracks have been removed by the municipalities of São Gonçalo and Niterói. Since in the future there is the proposal to use the bed of this branch for the implementation of part of the projected [[Line 3 (Rio de Janeiro)|Line 3]] of the [[Rio Metro]] between Niterói and Itaboraí.

==Administrative divisions==
From 1943 to the late 1970s, the county of Niteroi comprised two districts only: the district of Niteroi (original area) and the district of Itaipu (acquired in 1943), which barely had an urban continuity or even proper road links to each other and were considered apart areas.  The fractioning of Itaipu's farms into real estates as well its boom after the building of the Rio-Niterói's bridge demanded a better integration between the two sides of the county which led to the improving of the roads and urban facilities and a reformation on the make up of Niteroi's administrative division.  The county was reorganised into five districts.  In the early 1990s, the [[Administrative division (Niterói)|administrative division of Niterói]] was altered once again, being the county now divided into twelve administrative, further subdivided into 52 ''bairros'' (neighborhoods) and 5 ''Regiões de Planejamento'' ("Planning Regions"):<ref>https://leismunicipais.com.br/a1/plano-diretor-niteroi-rj Legislação Municipal de Niterói/RJ</ref>
