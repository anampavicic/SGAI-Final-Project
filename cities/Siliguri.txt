Siliguri has great strategic importance in West Bengal, with convenient access to four international borders: [[China]], [[Nepal]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Bhutan]]. It also connects the North-East with mainland India. Located in the foothills of [[Eastern Himalaya]]s, Siliguri is a significant trading and transportation hub.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Siliguri-SMC|url=http://www.siligurismc.in/history-of-siliguri.php|access-date=4 August 2019|archive-date=22 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622223257/http://www.siligurismc.in/history-of-siliguri.php|url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:BAYLEY(1838) Map of the Country between Titaleea and Dorjeling.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Map of Darjeeling district (1838) during regime of [[Chogyal|Rajah of Sikkim]]]]

===Etymology===
[[File:Historical Map of Sikkim in northeastern India.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Map of Darjeeling district (1876) after being considered a "regulated area" by the British government]]

According to Sailen Debnath, "Siliguri" means a stack of pebbles or stones. Until the 19th century this region was called as "Shilchaguri" when there was dense Dolka forest covering the region. <ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-10-01 |title=History of Siliguri |url=https://www.siligurionline.in/guide/history-of-siliguri }}</ref>

===Modern history===
Siliguri was a small agricultural village in the [[Kingdom of Sikkim]]. It was captured by the [[Kingdom of Nepal]] in 1788, after which [[Kirati people|Kirati]] and Nepali [[Lepcha people|Lepchas]] came to settle in this region.<ref name="History of Siliguri">{{cite web |date=2018 |title=Handbook on Siliguri |url=http://asiscwb.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Siliguri-Handbook-1.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190520082216/http://asiscwb.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Siliguri-Handbook-1.pdf |archive-date=20 May 2019 |access-date= |website=asiscwb.org |publisher=Association of Schools for the Indian Schools Certificate}}</ref>

At that time a river port on [[Mahananda River|Mahananda]], South of Siliguri in [[Phansidewa]] had an important role in having trade bond with [[Malda City|Malda]], [[Bengal]] and [[Bihar]]. This riverine trade line was thus used by the [[Bhutan]]ese and [[Sikkimese people|Sikkimese]] to bring goods into their mainland.

Siliguri started as a small area in the northern part of city, on the front of [[Mahananda River]], which is now Dagapur. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] in 1816, signed between Britain-Nepal, changed the prospects of Siliguri, and it became a point of transit for the [[Darjeeling]] hills and [[Nepal]] mainland. From 1816 onwards, Siliguri started growing rapidly as a small city due to its strategic location in trade routes. In 1865, the British captured Darjeeling and the entire [[Dooars]] region to build tea plantations and export the produce to England. To scale up exportation they introduced the [[Siliguri Town railway station]] which stands to this day, and introduced the [[Darjeeling Himalayan Railway|Toy train]] from the station to Darjeeling in 1880. This helped Siliguri gain sub-divisional town status in 1907.<ref name="Historical profile of Siliguri">{{cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GvGAG4dYG7qzx6amp2EQYoeahm8EnuSK/view?usp=drivesdk.pdf|title=Modern history of Siliguri|access-date=30 April 2019|archive-date=22 April 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220422181608/https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GvGAG4dYG7qzx6amp2EQYoeahm8EnuSK/view?usp=drivesdk.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Siliguri Corridor]] was formed when [[Bengal]] was divided into [[West Bengal]] and [[East Pakistan]] (later Bangladesh) in 1947, with Sikkim later merging with India in 1975.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Sikkim Voters OK Merger With India |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19750416&id=vDogAAAAIBAJ&pg=7319,25549 |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |date=16 April 1975 |access-date=20 May 2019 |archive-date=21 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210121042224/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19750416&id=vDogAAAAIBAJ&pg=7319,25549 |url-status=live }}</ref> At this point many immigrants came to settle here for better infrastructure, which led to an increased population.

After few years in 1961 all these stations were connected with broad gauge [[New Jalpaiguri Junction railway station]] which later became the most important railway station in Northeast India.<ref>{{cite book|isbn=9788186860441|author=Sailen Debnath|title=The Dooars in Historical Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K1viSAAACAAJ|date=January 2010|publisher=N.L.

Due to tremendous growth, Siliguri is now far away from its past outlook, becoming the largest and fastest growing city in eastern India after [[Guwahati]]. The growth rate of Siliguri was 57.8% during 1971- 1981. Considering this growth, Siliguri came under the Integrated Urban Development Project program in 1981. Siliguri population growth rate rose to 46.8% of 1981–1991. A treaty between India and China for trade through [[Nathu La|Nathu La Pass]], has expedited development and prospects of Siliguri as an international transportation and logistics hub. Later in 1994 Siliguri built a Municipal corporation which has been responsible for the civic infrastructure and administration of the city of Siliguri. Siliguri has now achieved the status of becoming the [[List of metropolitan area in West Bengal|third-largest]] city in [[West Bengal]], after [[Kolkata]] and [[Asansol]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siliguri.gov.in/|title=Siliguri in recent days|website=www.siliguri.gov.in|access-date=30 April 2019|archive-date=1 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501001830/http://siliguri.gov.in/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Location===
[[File:Kanchenjunga Sevoke Road.jpg|thumb|Kangchenjunga in an early August morning in Siliguri]]
Siliguri is located at the foothills of the eastern Himalayas at a location of {{coord|26.71|N|88.43|E|}}. The city is spread over an area of 260 km<sup>2</sup> within the [[Siliguri Corridor]], and has earned a [[moniker]] the ''Chicken's neck''. The city is surrounded by dense forests towards north and lifeline of Siliguri, [[Mahananda River]] flows through the city thereby bisecting it into two halves.

== Governance and politics ==
=== Civic administration ===
Siliguri saw rapid urbanisation under the British rule and that was reflected in its local governance as well. The earliest form of local urban governance was a Sanitation Committee set up in 1915.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Das|first=Chinmayakar|title=People Governance and development a study of Siliguri Municipal corporation area|url=https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/137085|access-date=30 September 2020|website=Shodhganga|hdl=10603/137085|archive-date=17 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417093921/http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/137085|url-status=live}}</ref>  Its function was to dispose off night soil. Till 1921, most aspects of local governance in Darjeeling district, including Siliguri, was looked after by the Darjeeling Improvement Fund. In 1922,  Siliguri Local Board with nominated members was created under the Bengal Local Self Government Act, 1885. In 1938, the Union Board was set up in Siliguri under the Bengal Village Self-Government Act, 1919 and it provided public utilities in the city.

The [[Municipal Council (India)|Municipal Council]] was set up in 1949 under the Bengal Municipal Act of 1932 with 8 wards.<ref name=":0" /> The first chairperson of the municipality was the Sub Divisional Officer, and the local councillors, called 'commissioners' in the then municipal act in effect, were nominated by the state government. After the amendment of the act in 1956, 3/4 of the local representatives were elected, while the remaining nominated by the Deputy Commissioner.

Sal occupies about 80% of all vegetation in these tropical forest.

These forests are categorised by their dominating plant species such as
