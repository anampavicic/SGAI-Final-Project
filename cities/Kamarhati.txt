'''Kamarhati''' is a city and a municipality<ref>[http://www.wbcensus.gov.in/DataTables/01/Table-3.htm District-wise list of statutory towns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050319042054/http://www.wbcensus.gov.in/DataTables/01/Table-3.htm |date=2005-03-19 }}</ref> of [[North 24 Parganas district]] in the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[West Bengal]]. It is a part of the area covered by [[Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority]] (KMDA).

==History==
Kamarhati was earlier a part of North Suburban Municipality. In 1881-82 it was renamed [[Baranagar Municipality]] and Kamarhati became a part of it. In 1899, Kamarhati was separated from Baranagar Municipality and Kamarhati Municipality came into existence.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://kamarhatimunicipality.org/cms.php?page=Ng==  | title = About Kmarhati Municipality | work = Historical background | publisher =  Kamarhati Municipality | access-date =  25 June 2018}}</ref>

During the [[British Raj]] it was a place for bungalows and gardens where the rich '[[Babu (title)|Babu]]' of Kolkata used to come.

With the [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|partition of Bengal]] in 1947, "millions of refugees poured in from erstwhile [[East Pakistan]]."<ref>Chatterjee, Monideep, "Town Planning in Calcutta: Past, Present and Future",  in "Calcutta, The Living City" Vol II, Edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Page 142, First published 1990, 2005 edition, {{ISBN|0-19-563697-X}}</ref> In the initial stages bulk of the refugees were non-agriculturists. A few of them made their own arrangements, but "it was squatters who made the [[East Bengali refugees]] famous or infamous." Squatting (''jabardakhal'' in Bengali) ranged from the forcible occupation of barracks to the collective take-over of private, government and waste land. By 1949, there were 65 refugee colonies in the Dum Dum and Panihati zone. The squatters were in a way "self-settlers" in the absence of adequate official arrangements for rehabilitation. Within a very short time the refugees (quite often with government/ administrative support) not only found a place to stay but developed a society with markets, schools, temples and sometimes even colleges, hospitals and recreational centres.<ref>Chatterjee, Nilanjana, "The East Bengal Refugees: A Lesson in Survival",  in "Calcutta, The Living City" Vol II, Edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Pages 72-75, First published 1990, 2005 edition, {{ISBN|0-19-563697-X}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| url = https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/file/722552/1/Myths%20refugees%20live%20by_Final.pdf |title =  The Myths Refugees Live By Memory and History of the Making of Bengali Refugee Identity |first=Uditi|last=Sen|journal =  Modern Asian Studies|year = 2014 |volume = 48 |pages = 37–76 |doi = 10.1017/S0026749X12000613 |s2cid = 144297665 | access-date = 5 March 2018}}</ref>
