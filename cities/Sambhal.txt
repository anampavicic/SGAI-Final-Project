Sambhal, the name being a derivation of Shambhu - an epithet of the Hindu god [[Shiva]], is an ancient settlement which fell within the [[Pañcāla]] kingdom and the [[Mauryan Empire]] in the ancient period.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=History Sambhal |url=https://sambhal.nic.in/history/ |access-date=2024-06-02 |website=District Sambhal, Government of Uttar Pradesh |language=en-US}}</ref> It is also said to be mentioned in [[Ptolemy's world map|Ptolemy's Tables]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |title=Shambhala / Shangri-la |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/shangri-la.htm |access-date=2024-06-02 |website=[[Global Security]]}}</ref>

Sambhal is sometimes identified as [[Shambhala]], a village which is mentioned as the birthplace of [[Kalki]], the next incarnation of [[Vishnu]], in the Hindu [[Purana]]s (the city is also home to a "Shri Kalki Vishnu [[Mandir]]").<ref name="MW">''Śambhala'', also ''Sambhala'', is the name of a town between the Rathaprā and Ganges rivers, identified by some with Sambhal in Uttar Pradesh. In the [[Purana]]s, it is named as the place where [[Kalki]], the last incarnation of Vishnu, is to appear (Monier-Williams, ''Sanskrit-English Dictionary'', 1899).</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Places of Interest |url=https://sambhal.nic.in/places-of-interest/ |access-date=2024-06-02 |website=District Sambhal, Government of Uttar Pradesh |language=en-US}}</ref> This was borrowed into the [[Buddhist mythology]] of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] where it is described as a [[mythological place|mythological kingdom]] and a [[pure land]] beyond the [[Himalayas]] where the future [[Maitreya]] will emerge from.<ref>[https://snl.no/Shambhala Shambhala]. ''[[Store norske leksikon]]''.</ref> According to [[Ibn Battuta]], [[Toghon Temür]] the last [[Yuan dynasty]] emperor of China had sent an embassy to the [[Sultan of Delhi]] [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]], requesting permission to rebuild a Buddhist temple at Sambhal, which at the time attracted pilgrims from Tibet.<ref name=":2" />

Sambhal has been an urban center for hundreds of years and was a prominent town during the [[Medieval India|medieval period]]. Two legendary battles between [[Prithviraj Chauhan]] and [[Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud]] are claimed to have taken place here. At the time under local rulers, in the 13th and 14th-centuries it would go on to become a part of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], first under [[Qutb ud-Din Aibak]] and later under [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq]].<ref name=":1" />

It was a capital of the [[Lodi dynasty]] of the Delhi Sultanate under [[Sikandar Lodi]] for four years in the 15th-century. A folio from the [[Baburnama]], depicts an award ceremony in Sultan [[Ibrahim Lodi]]'s court before an expedition to Sambhal in the early 16th-century. After the collapse of the Delhi Sultanate, the city fell to the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] under [[Babur]], briefly serving as the capital of the new empire. Babur is also claimed to have built a mosque here which is still extant. The city would later be governed by his son [[Humayun]]. Sambhal flourished under the rule of [[Akbar]], Humayun's son, but subsequently deteriorated in popularity when Akbar's grandson [[Shah Jahan]] was made in charge of the city, and the local ([[Sarkar (administrative division)|sarkar]]) capital was shifted to [[Moradabad]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/520415/Sambhal|title = Sambhal &#124; India &#124; Britannica}}</ref><ref>Ain-i-Akbari, Vol II, Tr.H.S.
