==Etymology==
The name "Taytay" may have derived from the following:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.taytayrizal.gov.ph/about|title=About our Municipality|website=Smile Taytay|accessdate=August 22, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://taytaynijuan.me/taytay-rizal-legends-history/|title=Taytay legends and history|website=Taytay ni Juan|date=January 8, 2018 |accessdate=August 22, 2023}}</ref>
*the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] words ''tayutay'' (figure of speech), ''hintay-hintay'' (wait), and ''itay-itay'' which came about while transacting with Chinese traders as the town did as one of the lakeshore settlements around Laguna de Bay;
*the Tagalog word ''tatay'', which means father and is synonymous with the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] words ''padre'' (priest) or ''tata'' (uncle), according to a legend;
* ''tagaytay'' trees that once abound in the town, according to a legend; and 
* the word ''taitai'' (similar with the [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] word ''tete''), which means bridge to the Negrillos ([[Aeta]]s) that wandered in Taytay and Antipolo, according to a claim.

==History==
{{more citations needed section|date=August 2017}}
Taytay was a settlement situated along the coastline of the eastern side of [[Laguna de Bay]] that formed part of the [[Kingdom of Namayan]], also known as the Kingdom of ''"Sapa"'', which was ruled by Lakan Tagkan. The said territory is what we know now as the district of [[Santa Ana, Manila]].

Upon the arrival of the Franciscan missionaries on July 2, 1578, in Manila, they proceeded to evangelize the inhabitants of Namayan and organized it into a ''pueblo'' and named it ''Visita Santa Ana de Sapa''. It comprised the communities of Meycatmon, Calatongdongan, Dongos, Dibag, Pinacauasan, Yamagtogon, Meysapan (Pasay), Malate, Dilao (Paco), Pandacan, Quiapo, Sampaloc, San Miguel, San Juan del Monte, San Felipe Neri (Mandaluyong), San Pedro Macati, and Taytay.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Estado Geografico, Tofografico, Estodestico, Historico Religioso, de la Santa y Apostolica Provincia de San Gregorio Magno, de religiosos menores de scalzos de la regular y más estrecha observancia de N.S.P.S. Francisco, en las islas Filipinas.|last=de Huerta|first=Felix|publisher=Imprenta de M. Sánchez y Cía, Manila.|year=1865|pages=50, 53}}</ref>

Thence, the district of ''Santa Ana de Sapa'' became the Franciscan's central mission station.

In 1579, Taytay was formally established as a town and Church in a symbiotic relation, ''i.e.,'' it presupposes that one could not have existed without the other. A church was built out of light materials and called it '''''“Visita de Santa Ana de Sapa”'''''. Taytay—now a larger village, a ''pueblo'', a town—came into being, as a juridical entity as well as an actual territorial unit.

Saint John the Baptist has since been the patron of the town and the parish under the ministry of the Franciscans.

The ecclesial jurisdiction of Taytay, including the visita of Cainta, which was an annex of Taytay, were transferred to the newly arrived Jesuit missionaries in 1591. They served until 1768—for 177 years.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lakbay-Pananampalataya--Parokya ni San Juan Bautista, Taytay|last=Fernandez|first=Jose "Ding" A.|year=2013|page=15}}</ref>

Fray Pedro Chirino, a distinguished historian, became the first Jesuit parish priest of Taytay. He celebrated his first Holy Mass as a missionary in the swampy resettlement area on March 25, 1591, the feast of the Annunciation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fernandez, Jose Ding. Lakbay-Pananampalataya -- Parokya ni San Juan Bautista, Taytay. 15 Sept 2013. p-16}}</ref>

Due to incessant flood, the town was relocated to a higher ground. The people followed suit after the church was rebuilt atop a hill. Taytay town was dedicated to Saint John the Baptist and christened '''''“San Juan del Monte”''''' [which means “Saint John of the Mountain”].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Chirino del P. Pedro.

Nevertheless, the townspeople continued to call their town Taytay, and Taytay it has remained to this day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=de la Costa, SJ., Horacio (1961). The Jesuits in the Philippines 1581-1768.Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press. pp. p. 138}}</ref>

'''<big>Encomienda in Taytay</big>'''

''Adelantado'' Miguel Lopez de Legazpi enforced the ''encomienda'' system into the Philippine Islands since his arrival in 1565. Taytay ''encomienda'' alone had 500 natives in 1582. There were about 400 households in Taytay, while only 100 households in Antipolo in 1591 [both ''encomiendas'' had already been granted to Juan Pacheco de Maldonado]; and in that same year, Taytay ''encomienda'' also listed 600 ''tributantes'' and inhabitants of 2,400 to 3,000.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Juan de Plasencia, OFM -- Tatay ng Taytay ni Juan|last=Feernandez|first=Jose Ding|date=March 25, 2017|page=24}}</ref>

The kinds of ''encomienda'' were those of the Royal Crown ''(encomienda de la real corona)'', and those of the private persons ''(encomienda de perticulares)''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Relacion de las Encomiendas, existentes en Filipinas. Retana, Archivo del Bibliófilo Filipino, Vol. IV}}</ref>  In 1591, the ''encomienda'' of Taytay which was included in the vast district of ''Santa Ana de Sapa,'' belonged to the Royal Crown.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Jose "Ding" Fernandez. Juan de Plasencia, OFM: Tatay ng Taytay ni Juan. p.23-24 (Part 2); ACADEMIA.EDU}}</ref>

The lakeshore town of Taguig on the West was at the opposite side of Taytay on the East of Laguna de Bay. They were both ''encomiendas'' under the scope of ''Santa Ana de Sapa.'' They were separated by a narrow tip portion of Pasig town. Adjacent to Pasig was the area situated on the lakeshore of Barangay Santa Ana of Taytay. It was a tract of agricultural land considered as a “friar estate” which is still known today as ''“Lupang Arenda”'' <!--  During Pres. Corazon Aquino's term, informal settlers were relocated in the “floodway” areas of Taytay. Pres. Fidel Ramos issued Proclamation 704, allotted about 200 hectares in the same site to accommodate illegal settlers in Metro Manila. Pres. Erap Estrada promoted the same policy of his predecessors. After typhoon Ondoy in 2009, Pres. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo issued an Executive Order for the relocation of displaced Arenda settlers to other places, elsewhere but not in Lupang Arenda. Pres. Benigno Aquino III is being petitioned to declare Lupang Arenda as “suitable for habitation and housing use, and legitimize the resettlement of tens of thousands of informal dwellers.” -->which has now become a relocation and resettlement site.

''“Arenda”'' is a lease of fixed assets or of prerogatives, such as land, or of special rights engaging in agriculture, mining, the collection of duties and taxes. ''“Arenda”'' rights are directly associated with the ''encomienda.''

According to former Taytay Mayor Felix M. Sanvictores (1925-1931), ''“Lupang Arenda'' was donated by Don Juan Valerio Gonzales and Don Cristobal Paramdam to the ''Municipio'' in 1740. Aside from their own farmlands, Taytay farmers were also benefiting from farming in the ''“arenda''” as well as fishing in the wide rivers flowing down the lake and in the vast flooded farmlands near the lake during the rainy season.”<ref>{{Cite book|title=Feernandez, Jose Ding (25 March 2017). Juan de Plasencia, OFM -- Tatay ng Taytay ni Juan. p. 26.}}</ref>

On February 23, 1853, a decree of the Superior Government created a district composed of the towns of Taytay, Antipolo, Bosoboso, and Cainta [from the Province of Tondo], and the towns of Morong, Baras, Tanay, Pililla, Angono, Binangonan, Cardona, and Jalajala [from the Province of La Laguna], with Morong as its capital town.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Huerta. p.101-102}}</ref> It was later called ''Distrito Politico-Militar de Morong''.

'''<big>The coming of Americans</big>'''

Taytay suffered heavy casualties during the Philippine–American War in 1899, with the church almost burned down and most of the town razed to the ground.<ref name=":0" />

On June 11, 1901, Taytay became part of the newly created Province of Rizal by virtue of an Act No. 137 enacted by the First Philippine Commission. In 1903, Taytay was merged with the neighboring towns of Cainta and Angono by virtue of Act No. 942. That did not last long as Angono was separated to be merged with Binangonan later that year and Cainta became an independent town again in 1914.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tanay Tercenary Souvenir: 1640-1940 & The Towns of Rizal Province|publisher=Catolos, Bendana & Santos|year=1940}}</ref>

During the Second World War, Taytay was occupied by Japanese forces in 1942. Local soldiers of the pre-war 42nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 4th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary liberated and entered Taytay in 1945 to help the recognized guerrilla fighter units to defeat and attack the Japanese Imperial Army. On November 7, 1975, by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 824, which created the Metro Manila Area, Taytay was among the towns that remained within the Province of Rizal.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The National Competitiveness Council has named Taytay as the "2nd Most Competitive Municipality (1st & 2nd Class) since 2016 until 2017",<ref>The Cities and Municipalities Competitiveness Index 2016: [http://www.competitive.org.ph/cmcindex/pages/rankings/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718092932/http://www.competitive.org.ph/cmcindex/pages/rankings/|date=July 18, 2016}}, 2016</ref><ref>The Cities and Municipalities Competitiveness Index 2017: [http://www.cmcindex.org.ph/pages/rankings/index.php] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913044740/http://www.cmcindex.org.ph/pages/rankings/index.php|date=September 13, 2017}}, 2017</ref> up from 10th place in 2014<ref>The Cities and Municipalities Competitiveness Index:''{{cite web |url=http://www.competitive.org.ph/cmcindex/municipalityprofile.php?municipality=Taytay%20(RL) |title=Municipality of Taytay (RL)|access-date=April 30, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027202451/http://www.competitive.org.ph/cmcindex/municipalityprofile.php?municipality=Taytay%20(RL) |archive-date=October 27, 2014 }}'',2014</ref> and 3rd place in 2015.<ref>The Cities and Municipalities Competitiveness Index 2015:''[http://www.competitive.org.ph/cmcindex/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821102027/http://www.competitive.org.ph/cmcindex/|date=August 21, 2014}}'', 2015</ref> In The Year 2018, The Municipality of Taytay jumped from "2nd Most Competitive Municipality" to "1st Most Competitive Municipality (1st & 2nd Class)

==Geography==
It is situated in the province's western portion, bounded by the grids 14° 34’ 24" north latitude and 121° 07’ 48" east longitude. It shares boundaries with Cainta in the Northwest, Antipolo in the North-north-east, Angono in the East-southeast and Taguig in the Southwest. The municipality is sited to East of Pasig and to the North of Laguna Lake. It has an area of {{convert|38.80|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} representing 3.3% of Rizal Province's land area.

The shape of Taytay is rectangular – trapezoidal with gently hilly rolling terrain on its eastern side while relatively flat on its south-western side, including the poblacion. The municipality's highest elevation ranges from 200 to 255 meters which is situated along the inner north-eastern hills of Barangay Dolores, alongside the Antipolo Boundary. Its lowest points are from 5 to 20 meters along the southern portion of Barangay San Juan and Muzon towards Laguna Lake.

From [[Laguna de Bay]], the [[Pasig River]] runs between [[Taguig]], and Taytay, Rizal, before entering [[Pasig]].

The [[Manggahan Floodway]] lessens flood conditions in Metro Manila by carrying flood waters to Laguna de Bay, but contributes to flooding of the coastal areas of Taguig, Taytay, and other towns in Laguna and Rizal along the lake.

The municipality is principally drained by south-west trending rivers such as Taytay River, Panghulo River, and Napindan Channel, all of which empties into Laguna Lake. Taytay River flows across Barangays Dolores and San Isidro and joins Antipolo River (present course of Manggahan Floodway) as it passes through the southern end of Barangays Santa Ana and San Juan. Panghulo River snakes its way from upper Taytay across Barangay San Juan towards the southern portion of Barangay Muzon. Napindan Channel crosses the southern boundaries of Barangay Santa Ana and San Juan as it empties into Laguna Lake. Bangiad Creek, found at the south-eastern limits of the municipality, flows south-west ward across Barangay Muzon, extending toward Laguna Lake.

===Location===
Taytay is {{convert|20|km|sp=us}} away from [[Manila]]. It is accessible from various points from Metro Manila through the [[Ortigas Avenue]] Extension, [[Manila East Road]], Taytay Diversion Road (segments of [[Radial Road 5]] or R-5), [[Felix Avenue]] (formerly Imelda Avenue), [[Manggahan Floodway]], and [[Sumulong Highway]].

===Barangays===
[[File:Taytay.png|thumb|upright=1.1|{{center|Political subdivisions}}]]
Taytay is politically subdivided into five [[barangay]]s. Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s and some have [[sitios]].

This political subdivision remains the same even though Taytay consistently ranks among the top municipalities throughout the country in terms of economic development and status and population density. Taytay conspicuously has the fewest barangays throughout the country. Today, there is a clamor from its citizens for the creation of more barangays for better coordination and management of its huge terrain and growing population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://taytaynijuan.me/payag-ka-bang-5-barangay-lang-ang-taytay/|last=Fernandez|first=Jose Ding|title=Payag ka bang 5 Barangay lang ang Taytay?|website=Taytay ni Juan|date=May 18, 2018|lang=tl}}</ref>

==Economy==
===Garment industry===
The town of Taytay is considered as the Garments Capital of the Philippines.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-12-05 |title=Taytay, Rizal: The Garments Capital of the Philippines |url=https://flyingketchup.ph/taytay-rizal-the-garments-capital-of-the-philippines/ |access-date=2023-06-25 |website=Flying Ketchup |language=en-US}}</ref> Garment industry is the main economic driver of the town known for its high quality ready-to-wear (RTW) clothing. The town's garment industry and its related downstream cottage industries provide livelihood and employment opportunities to people on its villages where subcontracting among household families is a cottage industry. It has also spawned small entrepreneural brick-and-mortar stores and online sellers among its residents. The upstream industries created is the mushrooming of textile markets, sewing machine making, and cargo and delivery.

Taytay town is now the Philippines' production hub of cheaper ready-to-wear clothes. It enabled the country to resurrect its garment industry back after decades of hiatus due to competition from countries such as [[Bangladesh]], [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]] and to a certain extent [[China]]. It is now displacing imported clothing due to its highly competitive pricing, wide array designs and quality.

Today, various shops cluster in Kalayaan park every Friday or in Club Manila East Open Space every Saturday to take the advantage of low-cost ready-made clothing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taytayrizal.net/aboutus.htm |title=Taytayrizal.net |publisher=Taytayrizal.net |access-date=January 24, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219051458/http://www.taytayrizal.net/aboutus.htm |archive-date=February 19, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

As of 2017, there are around 10 garments center operating in Club Manila East Compound. Each garment center has hundreds to thousands of stalls selling different clothes by family owned garment factories. Of these ten, the biggest are Taytay Municipal Tiangge, Bagpi Garment Center, Igpai Garment Center, MASUERTE 4JC Tiangge and Freedom bazaar. Each center has varying schedule of opening and closing but almost all are open on main market days of Monday and Thursday evenings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cosmo.ph/lifestyle/travel/the-ultimate-guide-to-taytay-rizal-shopping-a1863-20170916|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170919063830/http://www.cosmo.ph/lifestyle/travel/the-ultimate-guide-to-taytay-rizal-shopping-a1863-20170916|archive-date = September 19, 2017|title = The Ultimate Guide to Tiangge Shopping in Taytay, Rizal (2019 Edition)}}</ref>

===IT industry===

==Infrastructure==

===Waste management===
Taytay has a current total fleet of only ten dump trucks that regularly collect the garbage generated by its five barangays. Their capabilities can haul the average generated solid waste of {{convert|50|to|60|MT}} per day based on population. These are dumped {{convert|3|km|sp=us}} away in a valley area near the boundary with Antipolo north-east of the town center and adjacent to Rosario Memorial Park.

===Transportation===
[[File:Manila East Road from SM City Taytay Footbridge 4-17-22.jpg|thumb|Taytay Diversion Road]]
Taytay has an existing road network with a total length of {{convert|139.666|km|sp=us}}. The two main roads cutting through Taytay and serving as the main access from Metro Manila are Rizal Avenue which leads to the Poblacion and the Central Business district of the town and the Manila East Road connecting from Ortigas Avenue Extension which passes north and north-east of the town center.  The roads meet at a junction just off the location of the New Taytay Public Market towards the adjacent town of Angono on its eastern boundary.

Before [[World War II]], Taytay was also served by a railway system. Known as the Antipolo Line, this railroad line passed through [[Santa Mesa]], [[Mandaluyong]], [[Pasig]], and [[Cainta]], going all the way up to [[Antipolo]] near the [[Hinulugang Taktak]] Falls.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://lagunarailways.rihspi.org/search/label/Antipolo%20Extension|title = Antipolo Extension|website = Laguna Railways|publisher = Railways and Industrial Heritage Society of the Phils., Inc.}}</ref> Apart from a street named "Daangbakal" in Antipolo, no traces of this line presently survive especially in the Cainta and Taytay areas where the railway tracks used to be as roads have been paved over them.

Today, the town's transport needs are served by [[Motorized tricycles (Philippines)|tricycles]], [[jeepneys]], taxis, buses, and [[UV Express]] services, many of which serve to link the town to [[Metro Manila]] where many of the town's citizens work and study.

A proposed rapid transit line, [[MRT Line 4 (Metro Manila)|Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 4]], to be built in [[Metro Manila]] and Rizal Province will link Taytay to Ortigas Center business center. When completed, it is expected to significantly reduce the volume of vehicular traffic along Ortigas Avenue and improve connectivity in the eastern parts of the metropolis, including the nearby municipalities in southern Rizal.

One exit point of the under construction [[Southeast Metro Manila Expressway]] will help decongest the existing roadways across Metro Manila, such as [[EDSA]] ([[Circumferential Road 4|C-4]]) and [[Circumferential Road 5]] (C-5). SEMME is also known as Skyway Stage 4.

The number of telephones of the town is far beyond the minimum of one telephone line per 1000 residential population and also a single telephone line per 1500 population in industrial areas. Mobile services are also provided by [[Smart Communications]], [[Globe Telecom]], and [[Dito Telecommunity]].

The town operates a telegraph services unit which issues an average of 116 transmissions and 5,483 telegrams of all kinds per month.
