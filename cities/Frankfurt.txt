Like France and [[Franconia]], the city is named after the [[Franks]]. Frankfurt is the largest city in the [[Rhenish Franconian]] dialect area.

Frankfurt was a [[city state]], the [[Free City of Frankfurt]], for nearly five centuries, and was one of the most important cities of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], as a site of [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|Imperial coronations]]; it lost its [[sovereignty]] upon the collapse of the empire in 1806, regained it in 1815 and then lost it again in 1866, when it was annexed (though neutral) by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. It has been part of the state of Hesse since 1945. Frankfurt is culturally, ethnically and religiously diverse, with half of its population, and a majority of its young people, [[immigration to Germany|having a migrant background]]. A quarter of the population consists of foreign nationals, including many [[expatriate]]s. In 2015, Frankfurt was home to 1,909 [[ultra high-net-worth individual]]s, the sixth-highest number of any city.

Frankfurt has many downtown [[Tower block|high-rise buildings]] that form its renowned [[List of tallest buildings in Frankfurt|Frankfurt skyline]]. In fact, it is one of the few cities in the [[European Union]] (EU) to have such a skyline, which is why Germans sometimes refer to Frankfurt as [[Mainhattan]], combining the local river [[Main (river)|Main]] and "[[Manhattan]]". The other well-known nickname is [[Bankfurt]]. Before [[Bombing of Frankfurt am Main in World War II|World War II]], the city was noted for its unique [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|old town]], the largest timber-framed old town in Europe. The [[Römer]] area was later rebuilt and is popular with visitors and for events such as [[Frankfurt Christmas Market]]. Other parts of the old town were reconstructed as part of the [[Dom-Römer Project]] from 2012 to 2018.

==Etymology==
{{lang|goh|Frankonovurd}} (in [[Old High German]]) or {{lang|la|Vadum Francorum}} (in [[Latin]]) were the first names mentioned in written records from 794. It transformed to ''Frankenfort'' during the [[Middle Ages]] and then to ''Franckfort'' and ''Franckfurth'' in the [[modern history|modern era]]. According to historian [[David Gans]], the city was named {{circa|146 AD}} by its builder, a Frankish king named Zuna, who ruled over the province then known as [[Sicambri]]. He hoped thereby to perpetuate the name of his lineage.<ref>Dovid Solomon Ganz, ''Tzemach David'' (part 2), Warsaw 1859, p. 13b (Hebrew); Polish name of book: ''Cemahc Dawid''; cf. J.M. Wallace-Hadrill, ''Fredegar and the History of France'', University of Manchester, n.d. pp. 536–538.</ref> This is chronologically incompatible, however, with the archaeologically demonstrated Roman occupation of the area around [[Nida (Roman town)|Nida]] fortress in modern [[Heddernheim]]. The name is derived from the ''Franconofurd'' of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]] of the [[Franks]]; ''Furt'' ([[cf.]] English ''[[ford (river)|ford]]'') where the river was shallow enough to be crossed on foot.
[[File:Die Frankenfurt.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The legend of the ''Frankenfurt'' (ford of the Franks)]]
By the 19th century, the name ''Frankfurt'' had been established as the official spelling. The older English spelling of ''Frankfort'' is now rarely seen in reference to Frankfurt am Main, although more than a dozen other towns and cities, mainly in the United States, use this spelling, including [[Frankfort, Kentucky]], [[Frankfort (town), New York|Frankfort, New York]], and [[Frankfort, Illinois]]. ''The New York Times'' first used the Frankfurt spelling for Frankfurt am Main on 24 October 1953 and last used the Frankfort spelling on 10 June 1954.

The suffix ''am Main'' has been used regularly since the 14th century. In English, the city's full name of ''Frankfurt am Main'' means "Frankfurt on the Main" (pronounced like English ''mine'' or German {{lang|de|mein}}). Frankfurt is located on an ancient ford (German: ''{{Lang|de|Furt}}'') on the river [[Main (river)|Main]]. As a part of early [[Franconia]], the inhabitants were the early [[Franks]], thus the city's name reveals its legacy as "the ford of the Franks on the Main".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C&pg=PA135 |title=Placenames of the world |last=Room |first=Adrian |publisher=McFarland |year=2006 |page=135 |access-date=23 July 2009 |isbn=978-0-7864-2248-7 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722025846/http://books.google.com/books?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C&lpg=PA135&pg=PA135 |archive-date=22 July 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Among English speakers, the city is commonly known simply as Frankfurt, but Germans occasionally call it by its full name to distinguish it from the other (significantly smaller) German city of [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankfurt an der Oder]] in the [[States of Germany|''Land'']] of [[Brandenburg]] on the Polish border.

The city district [[Bonames]] has a name probably dating back to Roman times, thought to be derived from ''{{Not a typo|bona me(n)sa}}'' (good table).

The common abbreviations for the city, primarily used in railway services and on road signs, are ''Frankfurt (Main)'', ''Frankfurt (M)'', ''Frankfurt a. M.'', ''Frankfurt/Main'' or ''Frankfurt/M''. The common [[abbreviation]] for the name of the city is "FFM". Also in use is "FRA", the [[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA code]] for Frankfurt Airport.

===Early history and Holy Roman Empire===
At the western borders of Frankfurt lies the [[Michelsberg culture#Settlements|Kapellenberg]] as part of the Taunus with one of the first Stone Age cities in Europe.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.leiza.de/en/research/project-4/the-onset-of-urbanisation-in-the-rhine-main-region-6000-years-ago | title=LEIZA: The onset of urbanisation in the Rhine-Main region 6,000 years ago | access-date=17 December 2023 | archive-date=13 March 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240313223529/https://www.leiza.de/en/research/project-4/the-onset-of-urbanisation-in-the-rhine-main-region-6000-years-ago | url-status=live }}</ref> The Celts had different settlements in the Taunus mountains north of Frankfurt, the biggest one the [[Heidetrank Oppidum]]. The first traces of [[Germania|Roman settlements]] established in the area of the [[Nidda River|river Nidda]] date to the reign of Emperor [[Vespasian]] in the years 69 to 79 AD. [[Nida (Roman town)|Nida]] (modern [[Heddernheim]], [[Praunheim]]) was a Roman [[civitas]] capital (''Civitas Taunensium'').

[[Alemanni]] and Franks [[Francia|lived there]], and by 794, [[Charlemagne]] presided over an [[Council of Frankfurt|imperial assembly]] and church synod, at which ''Franconofurd'' (alternative spellings end with -furt and -{{Not a typo|vurd}}) was first mentioned. It was one of the two capitals of Charlemagne's grandson [[Louis the German]], together with [[Regensburg]]. Louis founded the [[collegiate church]], rededicated in 1239 to [[Bartholomew the Apostle]] and now [[Frankfurt Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Rolf Grosse |title=Du royaume franc aux origines de la France et de l'Allemagne 800–1214 |publisher=Presses Universitaires du Septentrion |date=2014 |page=47}}</ref>

Frankfurt was one of the most important cities in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. From 855, the [[German kings]] were elected and crowned in [[Aachen]]. From 1562, the kings and [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|emperors were crowned]] and [[Imperial election|elected]] in Frankfurt, initiated for [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]]. This tradition ended in 1792, when [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] was elected. His coronation was deliberately held on [[Bastille Day]], 14 July, the anniversary of the [[storming of the Bastille]]. The elections and coronations took place in [[Frankfurt Cathedral|St. Bartholomäus Cathedral]], known as the {{lang|de|Kaiserdom}} (Emperor's Cathedral), or its predecessors.

The {{lang|de|[[Messe Frankfurt|Frankfurter Messe]]}} ('Frankfurt Trade Fair') was first mentioned in 1150. In 1240, [[Emperor Frederick II]] granted an imperial privilege to its visitors, meaning they would be protected by the empire. The fair became particularly important when similar fairs in French Beaucaire lost attraction around 1380. [[Frankfurt Book Fair|Book trade fairs]] began in 1478.

In 1372, Frankfurt became a {{lang|de|Reichsstadt}} ([[Imperial Free City]]), i.e., directly subordinate to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and not to a regional ruler or a local nobleman.

In 1585, Frankfurt traders established a system of [[exchange rate]]s for the various currencies that were circulating to prevent cheating and extortion. Therein lay the early roots for the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

Frankfurt managed to remain neutral during the [[Thirty Years' War]], but suffered from the [[bubonic plague]] that refugees brought to the city. After the war, Frankfurt regained its wealth. In the late 1770s the theater principal [[Abel Seyler]] was based in Frankfurt, and established the city's theatrical life.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mohr |first=Albert Richard |author-link=Albert Richard Mohr |year=1967 |chapter=Abel Seyler und seine Verdienste um das Frankfurter Theaterleben |title=Frankfurter Theater von der Wandertruppe zum Komödienhaus: ein Beitrag zur Theatergeschichte des 18.

===Impact of French revolution and the Napoleonic Wars===
Following the [[French Revolution]], Frankfurt was occupied or bombarded several times by French troops. It remained a [[Free imperial city|Free city]] until the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1805/6. In 1806, it became part of the [[principality of Aschaffenburg]] under the {{lang|de|Fürstprimas}} ([[Prince-Primate]]), [[Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg]]. This meant that Frankfurt was incorporated into the [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. In 1810, Dalberg adopted the title of a [[Grand Duchy of Frankfurt|Grand Duke of Frankfurt]]. [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] intended to make his adopted son [[Eugène de Beauharnais]], already {{lang|fr|Prince de Venise}} ("[[prince of Venice]]", a newly established primogeniture in Italy), Grand Duke of Frankfurt after Dalberg's death (since the latter as a Catholic bishop had no legitimate heirs). The Grand Duchy remained a short episode lasting from 1810 to 1813 when the military tide turned in favor of the Anglo-Prussian-led allies that overturned the Napoleonic order. Dalberg abdicated in favor of Eugène de Beauharnais, which of course was only a symbolic action, as the latter effectively never ruled after the ruin of the French armies and Frankfurt's takeover by the allies.

===Frankfurt as a fully sovereign state===
After Napoleon's final defeat and abdication, the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–1815) dissolved the grand-duchy and Frankfurt became a fully sovereign city-state with a republican form of government. Frankfurt entered the newly founded [[German Confederation]] (till 1866) as a free city, becoming the seat of its {{lang|de|Bundestag}}, the confederal parliament where the nominally presiding [[Habsburg monarchy|Habsburg Emperor of Austria]] was represented by an Austrian "presidential envoy".

After the ill-fated [[German revolutions of 1848–1849|revolution of 1848]], Frankfurt was the seat of the first democratically elected German parliament, the [[Frankfurt Parliament]], which met in the {{lang|de|[[Frankfurter Paulskirche]]}} (St. Paul's Church) and was opened on 18 May 1848. In the year of its existence, the assembly developed a common constitution for a unified Germany, with the Prussian king as its monarch. The institution failed in 1849 when the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] king, [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]], declared that he would not accept "a crown from the gutter".

===Frankfurt after the loss of sovereignty===
[[File:Courbet Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|''View of Frankfurt am Main'', including the [[Alte Brücke (Frankfurt)|Alte Brücke]] (Old Bridge), by [[Gustave Courbet]] (1858)]]
Frankfurt lost its independence after the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866 when Prussia annexed several smaller states, among them the [[Free City of Frankfurt]]. The Prussian administration incorporated Frankfurt into its province of [[Hesse-Nassau]]. The Prussian occupation and annexation were perceived as a great injustice in Frankfurt, which retained its distinct western European, urban and cosmopolitan character. The formerly independent towns of [[Bornheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bornheim]] and [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bockenheim]] were incorporated in 1890.

In 1914, the citizens founded the University of Frankfurt, later named [[Goethe University Frankfurt]]. This marked the only civic foundation of a university in Germany; today it is one of Germany's largest.

From 6 April to 17 May 1920, following military intervention to put down the [[Ruhr uprising]], [[French occupation of Frankfurt|Frankfurt was occupied by French troops]].<ref>[http://www.stadtgeschichte-ffm.de/service/chronik/chronik_5_2_e.html Chronology: Emergence of a Modern City 1866–1945] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719085810/http://www.stadtgeschichte-ffm.de/service/chronik/chronik_5_2_e.html |date=19 July 2011 }}.

Frankfurt was severely [[Bombing of Frankfurt am Main in World War II|bombed in World War II]] (1939–1945). About 5,500 residents were killed during the raids, and the once-famous [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|medieval city center]], by that time one of the largest in Germany, was almost completely destroyed. It became a [[Battle of Frankfurt|ground battlefield]] on 26 March 1945, when the Allied advance into Germany was forced to take the city in contested urban combat that included a river assault. The [[5th Infantry Division (United States)|5th Infantry Division]] and the [[6th Armored Division (United States)|6th Armored Division]] of the [[United States Army]] captured Frankfurt after several days of intense fighting, and it was declared largely secure on 29 March 1945.<ref>{{Cite book |title=World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939–1946 |last=Stanton |first=Shelby |edition=2nd |year=2006 |publisher=Stackpole Books |isbn=9780811701570 |pages=57, 84}}</ref> Frankfurt consists to over 40% of buildings from before World War II, besides all destruction.<ref name="zensus2011.de">{{Cite web |url=https://zensus2011.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Publikationen/Aufsaetze_Archiv/2015_12_NI_GWZ_endgueltig.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4 |title=Gebäude- und Wohnungsbestand in Deutschland |publisher=Statistische Ämter des Bundes und der Länder |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240329165923/https://zensus2011.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Publikationen/Aufsaetze_Archiv/2015_12_NI_GWZ_endgueltig.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4 |archive-date=29 March 2024}}</ref>

After the end of the war, Frankfurt became a part of the newly founded state of Hesse, consisting of the old [[People's State of Hesse|Hesse-(Darmstadt)]] and the [[Province of Kurhessen|Prussian Hesse]] provinces. The city was part of the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany#American Zone of Occupation|American Zone of Occupation]] of Germany. The Military Governor for the United States Zone (1945–1949) and the United States High Commissioner for Germany (HICOG) (1949–1952) had their headquarters in the [[IG Farben Building]], intentionally left undamaged by the Allies' wartime bombardment.

Frankfurt was the original choice for the provisional capital city of the newly founded state of [[West Germany]] in 1949. The city constructed a parliament building that was never used for its intended purpose (it housed the radio studios of [[Hessischer Rundfunk]]). In the end, [[Konrad Adenauer]], the first postwar [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]], preferred the town of [[Bonn]], for the most part because it was close to his hometown, but also because many other prominent politicians opposed the choice of Frankfurt out of concern that Frankfurt would be accepted as the permanent capital, thereby weakening the West German population's support for a [[German reunification|reunification]] with [[East Germany]] and the eventual return of the capital to [[Berlin]].

Postwar reconstruction took place in a sometimes simple modern style, thus changing Frankfurt's architectural face. A few landmark buildings were reconstructed historically, albeit in a simplified manner (e.g., [[Römer]], [[St. Paul's Church, Frankfurt am Main|St. Paul's Church]], and [[Goethe House]]). The collection of historically significant [[Cairo Genizah]] documents of the Municipal Library was destroyed by the bombing. According to [[Arabist]] and Genizah scholar [[S.D. Goitein]], "not even handlists indicating its contents have survived."<ref>Goitein, S.D. ''A Mediterranean Society: The Jewish Communities of the Arab World as Portrayed in the Documents of the Cairo Geniza, Vol. I – Economic Foundations''.

The end of the war marked Frankfurt's comeback as Germany's leading financial hub, mainly because Berlin, now a city divided into [[History of Berlin#The divided city|four sectors]], could no longer rival it. In 1948, the Allies founded the [[Bank deutscher Länder]], the forerunner of {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Bundesbank]]|italic=no}}. Following this decision, more financial institutions were re-established, e.g. [[Deutsche Bank]] and [[Dresdner Bank]]. In the 1950s, Frankfurt Stock Exchange regained its position as the country's leading stock exchange.

Frankfurt also reemerged as Germany's transportation hub and [[Frankfurt Airport]] became Europe's second-busiest airport behind [[London Heathrow Airport]] in 1961.

During the 1970s, the city created one of Europe's most efficient underground transportation systems.<ref>{{cite web |title=Port of Frankfurt |url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/review/DEU_Port_of_Frankfurt_2769.php |website=World Port Source |access-date=29 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329121635/http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/review/DEU_Port_of_Frankfurt_2769.php |archive-date=29 March 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> That system includes a suburban rail system ([[Frankfurt S-Bahn|S-Bahn]]) linking outlying communities with the city center, and a deep underground light rail system with smaller coaches ([[Frankfurt U-Bahn|U-Bahn]]) also capable of travelling above ground on rails.

In 1998, the [[European Central Bank]] was founded in Frankfurt, followed by the [[European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority]] and [[European Systemic Risk Board]] in 2011.

Frankfurt is the largest city in the [[states of Germany|state]] of [[Hesse]] in the western part of Germany.

===Site===
Frankfurt is located on both sides of the river [[Main (river)|Main]], south-east of the [[Taunus]] mountain range. The southern part of the city contains the [[Frankfurt City Forest]], Germany's largest city forest. The city area is {{cvt|248.31|km²|2}} and extends over {{cvt|23.4|km|2}} east to west and {{cvt|23.3|km|2}} north to south. Its downtown is north of the river Main in [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] district (the historical center) and the surrounding [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Innenstadt]] district. The geographical center is in [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bockenheim]] district near [[Frankfurt West station]].

Frankfurt at the heart of the densely populated [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main|Frankfurt Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region]] with a population of 5.5&nbsp;million. Other important cities in the region are [[Wiesbaden]] (capital of [[Hesse]]), [[Mainz]] (capital of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]), [[Darmstadt]], [[Offenbach am Main]], [[Hanau]], [[Aschaffenburg]], [[Bad Homburg vor der Höhe]], [[Rüsselsheim]], [[Wetzlar]] and [[Marburg]].

===Districts===
[[File:Frankfurt Subdivisions boroughs.svg|thumb|The 46 ''Stadtteile'' (city districts) of central Frankfurt, 2010]]
The city is divided into 46 city districts (''Stadtteile''), which are in turn divided into 121 city boroughs (''Stadtbezirke'') and 448 electoral districts (''Wahlbezirke''). The 46 city districts combine into 16 area districts (''[[Ortsbezirk (Frankfurt am Main)|Ortsbezirke]]''), which each have a district committee and chairperson.

The largest city district by population and area is [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]], while the smallest is [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]], Frankfurt's historical center. Three larger city districts (Sachsenhausen, [[Westend (Frankfurt am Main)|Westend]] and [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Nordend]]) are divided for administrative purposes into a northern (''-Nord'') and a southern (''-Süd'') part, respectively a western (''-West'') and an eastern (''-Ost'') part, but are generally considered as one city district (which is why often only 43 city districts are mentioned, even on the city's official website).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2835 |title=Stadtteile |publisher=Frankfurt.de |access-date=27 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014170007/http://frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2835 |archive-date=14 October 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Some larger housing areas are often falsely called city districts, even by locals, like Nordweststadt (part of [[Niederursel (Frankfurt am Main)|Niederursel]], [[Heddernheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Heddernheim]] and [[Praunheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Praunheim]]), Goldstein (part of [[Schwanheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Schwanheim]]), Riedberg (part of [[Kalbach-Riedberg (Frankfurt am Main)|Kalbach-Riedberg]]) and [[Europaviertel]] (part of [[Gallus (Frankfurt am Main)|Gallus]]). The [[Bankenviertel]] (''banking district''), Frankfurt's financial district, is also not an administrative city district (it covers parts of the western [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Innenstadt]] district, the southern [[Westend (Frankfurt am Main)|Westend]] district and the eastern [[Bahnhofsviertel (Frankfurt am Main)|Bahnhofsviertel]] district).

Many city districts are incorporated suburbs (''[[Vororte]]'') or were previously independent cities, such as [[Höchst (Frankfurt am Main)|Höchst]]. Some like [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Nordend]] and [[Westend (Frankfurt am Main)|Westend]] arose during the rapid growth of the city in the [[Gründerzeit]] following the [[Unification of Germany]], while others were formed from territory which previously belonged to other city {{Not a typo|district(s)}}, such as [[Dornbusch (Frankfurt am Main)|Dornbusch]] and [[Riederwald (Frankfurt am Main)|Riederwald]].

===History of incorporations===
Until the year 1877 the city's territory consisted of the present-day inner-city districts of [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]], [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Innenstadt]], [[Bahnhofsviertel (Frankfurt am Main)|Bahnhofsviertel]], [[Gutleutviertel (Frankfurt am Main)|Gutleutviertel]], [[Gallus (Frankfurt am Main)|Gallus]], [[Westend (Frankfurt am Main)|Westend]], [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Nordend]], [[Ostend (Frankfurt am Main)|Ostend]] and [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]].

[[Bornheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bornheim]] was part of an administrative district called ''Landkreis Frankfurt'', before becoming part of the city on 1 January 1877, followed by [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bockenheim]] on 1 April 1895. [[Seckbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Seckbach]], [[Niederrad (Frankfurt am Main)|Niederrad]] and [[Oberrad (Frankfurt am Main)|Oberrad]] followed on 1 July 1900. The ''Landkreis Frankfurt'' was finally dispersed on 1 April 1910, and therefore [[Berkersheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Berkersheim]], [[Bonames (Frankfurt am Main)|Bonames]], [[Eckenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Eckenheim]], [[Eschersheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Eschersheim]], [[Ginnheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Ginnheim]], [[Hausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Hausen]], [[Heddernheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Heddernheim]], [[Niederursel (Frankfurt am Main)|Niederursel]], [[Praunheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Praunheim]], [[Preungesheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Preungesheim]] and [[Rödelheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Rödelheim]] joined the city. In the same year a new city district, [[Riederwald (Frankfurt am Main)|Riederwald]], was created on territory that had formerly belonged to Seckbach and Ostend.

On 1 April 1928 the City of [[Höchst (Frankfurt am Main)|Höchst]] became part of Frankfurt, as well as its city districts [[Sindlingen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sindlingen]], [[Unterliederbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Unterliederbach]] and [[Zeilsheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Zeilsheim]]. Simultaneously the ''Landkreis Höchst'' was dispersed with its member cities either joining Frankfurt ([[Fechenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Fechenheim]], [[Griesheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Griesheim]], [[Nied (Frankfurt am Main)|Nied]], [[Schwanheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Schwanheim]], [[Sossenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Sossenheim]]) or joining the newly established ''Landkreis'' of [[Main-Taunus-Kreis]].

[[Dornbusch (Frankfurt am Main)|Dornbusch]] became a city district in 1946. It was created on territory that had formerly belonged to Eckenheim and Ginnheim.

On 1 August 1972, Hesse's smaller suburbs of [[Harheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Harheim]], [[Kalbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Kalbach]], [[Nieder-Erlenbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Nieder-Erlenbach]], and [[Nieder-Eschbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Nieder-Eschbach]] became districts while other neighboring suburbs chose to join the Main-Taunus-Kreis, the [[Landkreis Offenbach]], the [[Kreis Groß-Gerau]], the [[Hochtaunuskreis]], the [[Main-Kinzig-Kreis]] or the [[Wetteraukreis]].

[[Bergen-Enkheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bergen-Enkheim]] was the last suburb to become part of Frankfurt on 1 January 1977.

[[Flughafen (Frankfurt am Main)|Flughafen]] became an official city district in 1979. It covers the area of Frankfurt Airport that had belonged to Sachsenhausen and the neighboring city of [[Mörfelden-Walldorf]].

Frankfurt's youngest city district is [[Frankfurter Berg]]. It was part of Bonames until 1996.

Kalbach was officially renamed [[Kalbach-Riedberg]] in 2006 because of the large residential housing development in the area known as Riedberg.

===Neighboring districts and cities===
[[File:Locator map of Planungsverband Ballungsraum Frankfurt Rhein-Main in Hesse.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Frankfurt urban area within [[Hesse]]]]

To the west Frankfurt borders the [[Districts of Germany|administrative district]] (''[[List of rural districts of Germany|Landkreis]]'') of [[Main-Taunus-Kreis]] with towns such as [[Hattersheim am Main]], [[Kriftel]], [[Hofheim am Taunus]], [[Kelkheim (Taunus)|Kelkheim]], [[Liederbach am Taunus]], [[Sulzbach (Taunus)|Sulzbach]], [[Schwalbach am Taunus]] and [[Eschborn]]; to the northwest the [[Hochtaunuskreis]] with [[Steinbach (Taunus)|Steinbach]], [[Oberursel (Taunus)]] and [[Bad Homburg vor der Höhe]]; to the north the [[Wetteraukreis]] with [[Karben]] and [[Bad Vilbel]]; to the northeast the [[Main-Kinzig-Kreis]] with [[Niederdorfelden]] and [[Maintal]]; to the southeast the city of [[Offenbach am Main]]; to the south the [[Offenbach (district)|Kreis Offenbach]] with [[Neu-Isenburg]] and to the southwest the [[Groß-Gerau (district)|Kreis Groß-Gerau]] with [[Mörfelden-Walldorf]], [[Rüsselsheim]] and [[Kelsterbach]].

Together with these towns (and some larger nearby towns, e.g., [[Hanau]], [[Rodgau]], [[Dreieich]], [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]]) Frankfurt forms a contiguous built-up urban area called ''Stadtregion Frankfurt'' which is not an official administrative district. The urban area had an estimated population of 2.3&nbsp;million in 2010, and is the [[List of urban areas in the European Union|13th-largest urban area in the EU]].

===Climate===
Frankfurt has a [[Temperateness|temperate]]-[[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''). Its climate features cool winters with frequent rain showers and overcast skies, and warm to hot summers. The average annual temperature is {{cvt|11.4|°C|1}}, with monthly mean temperatures ranging from {{cvt|2.7|°C|1}} in January to {{cvt|20.7|°C|1}} in July. The descriptions below are based on climate data between 1991 and 2020.

Due to its location at the northern tip of the [[Upper Rhine]] Valley in the Southwest of Germany, Frankfurt is one of the warmest and driest major German cities along with [[Darmstadt]], [[Mannheim]], [[Karlsruhe]] and [[Freiburg im Breisgau]]. Summers in Frankfurt can get quite hot when compared to the rest of the country. On average, it sees 62 days with a daily high temperature above 25&nbsp;°C and 18 days with a high above 30&nbsp;°C per year.

[[Climate change]] is elevating the number of hot days. In the year of 2018, Frankfurt recorded 108 days with a maximum over 25&nbsp;°C and 43 days with a high above 30&nbsp;°C. This is compared to 52 and 13 days on average per year between 1981 and 2010. The overall tendency for higher temperatures can also be seen when comparing the climate data from 1981 to 2010 with the data from 2010 to 2020. Being an [[urban heat island]], Frankfurt sometimes experiences [[tropical night]]s, where the temperature does not fall below 20&nbsp;°C between May and September. This is exacerbated and made more frequent as the density of the city stores daytime heat overnight.

The [[growing season]] is longer when compared to the rest of Germany, thus resulting in an early arrival of springtime in the region, with trees typically leafing out already toward the end of March.

Winters in Frankfurt are generally mild or at least not freezing with a small possibility of snow, especially in January and February but dark and often overcast. Frankfurt is, on average, covered with snow only for around 10 to 20 days per year.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/wissen/schneevergleich-fuer-deutsche-staedte-so-viel-schneit-es-bei-ihnen-1.4348735 |title=Winter-Bilanz: Schnee-Vergleich für Deutsche Städte. |newspaper=Süddeutsche.de |date=28 February 2019 |publisher=sueddeutsche.de |access-date=18 January 2021 |last1=Zajonz |first1=Moritz |archive-date=19 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240819053700/https://www.sueddeutsche.de/wissen/schneevergleich-fuer-deutsche-staedte-so-viel-schneit-es-bei-ihnen-1.4348735 |url-status=live }}</ref> The temperature falls below 0&nbsp;°C on about 64 days and the daily maximum stays below freezing for about 10 days on average per year. Some days with lows under −10&nbsp;°C can occur more often here than at the coasts of [[Northern Germany]], but not as frequently as in [[Bavaria]] or the eastern parts of Germany.

Because of the mild climate in the region, there are some well-known wine regions in the vicinity such as [[Rhenish Hesse]], [[Rheingau]], [[Franconia (wine region)]] and [[Bergstraße (route)]]. There is also a microclimate on the northern bank of the river [[Main (river)|Main]] which allows [[Palm tree|palms]], [[fig trees]], [[lemon trees]] and southern European plants to grow in that area. The area is called the "[[Nizza, Frankfurt|Nizza]]" (the German word for the southern French town [[Nice]]) and is one of the biggest parks with Mediterranean vegetation north of the [[Alps]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://frankfurt.de/english/discover-and-experience/sightseeing/gardens/nizza |title=Nizza, Stadt Frankfurt am Main |publisher=frankfurt.de |access-date=18 January 2021 |archive-date=18 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210118202137/https://frankfurt.de/english/sightseeing/gardens/nizza}}</ref>

During the 1970s, the state government of [[Hesse]] wanted to expand the city's administrative boundaries to include the entire urban area. This would have made Frankfurt officially the second-largest city in Germany after Berlin with up to 3 million inhabitants.<ref>H. Voit, Die kommunale Gebietsreform in: Erwin Stein (Hrsg.): 30 Jahre Hessische Verfassung, Wiesbaden 1976, p. 416 ff. (Text in German)</ref> However, because local authorities did not agree, the administrative territory is still much smaller than its actual urban area.

===Moroccan community===
Frankfurt has the largest Moroccan community in Germany, numbering about 8,000 people, and the [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main|Rhine-Main area]] has about 20,000. Many [[Moroccans]] came as guest workers in the 1970s. Today Frankfurt has many Moroccan restaurants, companies, shops, mosques and hamams. Due to the popularity of Moroccan culture in Frankfurt, it also led many people from the [[Maghreb]] and other African countries to move to Frankfurt. Famous singer [[Namika]] was born in Frankfurt to Moroccan parents.

=== Landtag election ===
For elections to the [[Landtag of Hesse|Hesse State Parliament]], Frankfurt am Main is split up into six constituencies. In total 15 delegates represent the city in the [[Landtag]] in [[Wiesbaden]]. The last election took place in October 2018. Six members of parliament were directly elected in their respective constituencies: Uwe Serke (CDU, Frankfurt am Main I), [[Miriam Dahlke]] (Greens, Frankfurt am Main II), Ralf-Norbert Bartel (CDU, Frankfurt am Main III), [[Michael Boddenberg]] (CDU, Frankfurt am Main IV), Markus Bocklet (Greens, Frankfurt am Main V) and Boris Rhein (CDU, Frankfurt am Main VI).

Delegates from Frankfurt often serve high-ranking positions in Hessian politics, e.g. [[Michael Boddenberg]] is Hessian Minister of Finance and Boris Rhein was elected President of the Landtag of Hesse in 2019.

=== German federal election ===
For federal elections which are held every four years, Frankfurt is split up into two constituencies. In the [[2017 German federal election|German federal election 2017]], [[Matthias Zimmer]] (CDU) and [[Bettina Wiesmann]] were elected to the Bundestag by directe mandate in [[Frankfurt am Main I (electoral district)|Frankfurt am Main I]] and [[Frankfurt am Main II (electoral district)|Frankfurt am Main II]] respectively. [[Nicola Beer]] (FDP), [[Achim Kessler]] (Linke), [[Ulli Nissen]] (SPD) and [[Omid Nouripour]] (Greens) were elected as well.

Nicola Beer resigned as a member of parliament in 2019 following her [[2019 European Parliament election|election to the European Parliament]] where she now serves as vice president.

Frankfurt is one of the world's most important financial hubs and Germany's financial capital, followed by [[Hamburg]] and [[Stuttgart]]. Frankfurt was ranked eighth at the [[Financial centre#Xinhua–Dow Jones Index (2010–2014)|International Financial Centers Development Index]] (2013), eighth at the [[Worldwide Centres of Commerce Index]] (2008), ninth at the [[Global Financial Centres Index]] (September 2013),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.longfinance.net/Publications/GFCI%2012.5.pdf |title=The Global Financial Centres Index 12.5 |date=January 2013 |publisher=Long Finance |access-date=29 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123231140/http://www.longfinance.net/Publications/GFCI%2012.5.pdf |archive-date=23 January 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> tenth at the [[Global city#Global Power City Index|Global Power City Index]] (2011), 11th at the [[Global city#Global City Competitiveness Index|Global City Competitiveness Index]] (2012), 12th at the Innovation Cities Index (2011),<ref>{{Cite web|date=18 October 2011|title=Innovation Cities Top 100 Index 2011|url=https://innovation-cities.com/innovation-cities-index-top-cities-for-innovation-2011/1649/|website=Innovation Cities™ Index|language=en-US|archive-date=7 January 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230107134327/https://innovation-cities.com/innovation-cities-index-top-cities-for-innovation-2011/1649/|url-status=live}}</ref> 14th at the [[Global city#World City Survey|World City Survey]] (2011) and 23rd at the [[Global city#Global Cities Index (Kearney)|Global Cities Index]] (2012).<ref name="Foreign Policy">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.atkearney.com/documents/10192/dfedfc4c-8a62-4162-90e5-2a3f14f0da3a |title=The 2012 Global Cities Index |magazine=Foreign Policy |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020223227/http://www.atkearney.com/documents/10192/dfedfc4c-8a62-4162-90e5-2a3f14f0da3a |archive-date=20 October 2013}}</ref>

The city's importance as a financial hub has risen since the [[eurozone crisis]]. Indications are the establishment of two institutions of the [[European System of Financial Supervisors]] ([[European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority]] and [[European Systemic Risk Board]]) in 2011, and the entry into force in 2014 of [[European Banking Supervision]], by which the European Central Bank has become the central supervisory authority for the euro area banking sector.

According to an annual study by [[Cushman & Wakefield]], the European Cities Monitor (2010), Frankfurt has been one of the top three cities for international companies in Europe, after London and Paris, since the survey started in 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cushwake.com/sites/landing/citiesmonitor/European-cities-monitor-2009-holding.pdf |title=ECM 2009v1:V1 |access-date=5 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922030005/http://www.cushwake.com/sites/landing/citiesmonitor/European-cities-monitor-2009-holding.pdf |archive-date=22 September 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> It is the only German city considered to be an [[Global city#GaWC study|alpha world city (category 3)]] as listed by the [[Loughborough University]] group's 2010 inventory,<ref name="Beaverstock">{{cite web |url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2010t.html |title=The World According to GaWC 2010 |publisher=Globalization and World Cities |first1=J.V. |last1=Beaverstock |first2=R.G. |last2=Smith |first3=P.J. |last3=Taylor |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010004859/http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2010t.html |archive-date=10 October 2013}}</ref> which was a promotion from the group's 2008 inventory when it was ranked as an alpha minus world city (category 4).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2008t.html |title=GaWC 2008 |publisher=Lboro.ac.uk |date=13 April 2010 |access-date=17 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200117133459/https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2008t.html |archive-date=17 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:European Central Bank - building under construction - Frankfurt - Germany - 14.jpg|thumb|The new headquarters of the European Central Bank in the Ostend district]]
Frankfurt is home to two important [[central bank]]s: the German Bundesbank and the European Central Bank (ECB).<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/tower-envy-frankfurt-may-be-home-to-one-central-bank-too-many/ |title=Tower envy: Frankfurt may be home to one central bank too many |date=10 August 2017 |work=POLITICO |access-date=27 December 2017 |language=en-US |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227235808/https://www.politico.eu/article/tower-envy-frankfurt-may-be-home-to-one-central-bank-too-many/ |archive-date=27 December 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

====European Central Bank====
[[File:Euro-Symbol von Ottmar Hörl, vor dem Gebäude der EZB in Frankfurt am Main.jpg|left|thumb|159x159px|[[Euro-Skulptur]]]]
The European Central Bank (''Europäische Zentralbank'') is one of the world's most important central banks with a balance sheet total of around 7 trillion.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.infina.at/trends/ezb-bilanzsumme/ | title=EZB-Bilanzsumme: Entwicklung und Prognose &#124; INFINA | access-date=18 July 2024 | archive-date=18 July 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240718044416/https://www.infina.at/trends/ezb-bilanzsumme/ | url-status=live }}</ref> The ECB sets monetary policy for the Eurozone, consisting of 19 [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]] that have adopted the [[Euro]] (€) as their common currency. From 1998 the ECB Headquarters have been located in Frankfurt, first in the [[Eurotower (Frankfurt)|Eurotower]] at Willy-Brandt-Platz and in two other nearby high-rises. The new [[Seat of the European Central Bank]] in the [[Ostend (Frankfurt am Main)|Ostend]] district, consisting of the former wholesale market hall (''[[Großmarkthalle]]'') and a newly built 185-meter skyscraper, was completed in late 2014. The new building complex was designed to accommodate up to 2,300 ECB personnel. The location is a few kilometers away from downtown and borders an industrial area as well as the Osthafen (''East Harbor''), It was primarily chosen because of its large premises which allows the ECB to install security arrangements without high fences.

The city honors the importance of the ECB by officially using the slogan "The City of the Euro" since 1998.

====Deutsche Bundesbank====
The {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Bundesbank]]|italic=no}} (German Federal Bank), located in [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Ginnheim]], was established in 1957 as the central bank for the Federal Republic of Germany. Until the euro (€) was introduced in 1999, the Deutsche Bundesbank was responsible for the monetary policy of Germany and for the German currency, the [[Deutsche Mark]] (DM). The Bundesbank was greatly respected for its control of inflation through the second half of the 20th century. Today the Bundesbank is an integral part of the [[European System of Central Banks]] (ESCB) which is formed by all 27 EU member states. Its bilance sheet total is around 2,7 trillion,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bundesbank.de/de/bundesbank/organisation/die-bundesbank-in-zahlen/die-bundesbank-in-zahlen-604102 | title=Die Bundesbank in Zahlen | access-date=18 July 2024 | archive-date=18 July 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240718044854/https://www.bundesbank.de/de/bundesbank/organisation/die-bundesbank-in-zahlen/die-bundesbank-in-zahlen-604102 | url-status=live }}</ref> making it the 4th biggest central bank.

===Frankfurt Stock Exchange===
{{main|Frankfurt Stock Exchange}}
[[File:Bulle und Bär Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|[[Market trend|Bull and bear]] in front of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange]]
The Frankfurt Stock Exchange (''Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse'') began in the ninth century. By the 16th century Frankfurt had developed into an important European hub for trade fairs and financial services. Today the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is by far the largest in Germany, with a turnover of more than 90 percent of the German [[stock market]] and is the third-largest in Europe after the [[London Stock Exchange]] and the European branch of the [[NYSE Euronext]]. The most important [[stock market index]] is the [[DAX]], the index of the 30 largest German business companies listed at the stock exchange. The stock exchange is owned and operated by {{Lang|de|[[Deutsche Börse]]|italic=no}}, which is itself listed in the DAX. Deutsche Börse also owns the European [[futures exchange]] [[Eurex]] and clearing company [[Clearstream]]. Trading takes place exclusively via the [[Xetra (trading system)|Xetra trading system]], with redundant floor brokers taking on the role of market-makers on the new platform.

On 1 February 2012 European Commission blocked the proposed merger of Deutsche Börse and [[New York Stock Exchange|NYSE Euronext]]. "The merger between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide. These markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive. We tried to find a solution, but the remedies offered fell far short of resolving the concerns."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-94_en.htm |website=europa.eu |title=Mergers: Commission blocks proposed merger between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, European Commission – Press release |access-date=19 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220020112/http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-94_en.htm |archive-date=20 February 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> European competition commissioner [[Joaquín Almunia]] said.

It is located downtown at the Börsenplatz. Deutsche Börse's headquarters are formally registered in Frankfurt, but it moved most of its employees to a high-rise called "The Cube" in [[Eschborn]] in 2010, primarily due to significantly lower local [[corporate tax]]es.

'''Römer'''
[[File:Frankfurter Römer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Römer]], the city hall]]
[[Römer]], the German word for [[Rome|Roman]], is a complex of nine houses that form the Frankfurt [[city hall]] (''Rathaus''). The houses were acquired by the city council in 1405 from a wealthy merchant family. The middle house became the city hall and was later connected with its neighbors. The ''Kaisersaal'' ("Emperor's Hall") is located on the upper floor and is where the newly crowned emperors held their banquets. The Römer was partially destroyed in World War II and later rebuilt. The surrounding square, the Römerberg, is named after the city hall.

[[File:Dom-Roemer-Projekt-Huehnermarkt-06-2018-Ffm-Altstadt-10008-9.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Dom-Römer Project|New Frankfurt Old Town]] was completed in 2018, including 15 reconstructed historical buildings.]]
The former [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] (old town) quarter between the Römer and the Frankfurt Cathedral was redeveloped as the [[Dom-Römer Project|Dom-Römer Quarter]] from 2012 to 2018, including 15 [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructions]] of historical buildings that were destroyed during World War II.

'''Frankfurt Cathedral'''

[[Frankfurt Cathedral]] (Frankfurter Dom) is not a cathedral, but the main Catholic church, dedicated to [[Bartholomew the Apostle|St. Bartholomew]]. The [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] building was constructed in the 14th and 15th centuries on the foundation of an earlier church from the [[Merovingian]] time. From 1356 onwards, kings of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] were elected in this church, and from 1562 to 1792, [[Holy Roman Empire|Roman-German]] emperors were crowned there.

Since the 18th century, St. Bartholomew's has been called ''Dom'', although it was never a bishop's seat. In 1867 it was destroyed by fire and rebuilt in its present style. It was again partially destroyed in [[World War II]] and rebuilt in the 1950s. Its height is 95 meters. The cathedral tower has a viewing platform open to the public at a height of 66 meters, accessed through a narrow spiral staircase with 386 steps.

'''St. Paul's Church'''

[[St. Paul's Church, Frankfurt|St. Paul's Church]] (''Paulskirche'') is a national historic monument in Germany because it was the seat of the first democratically elected parliament in 1848. It was established in 1789 as a [[Protestant]] church, but was not completed until 1833. Its importance has its roots in the [[Frankfurt Parliament]], which met in the church during the revolutionary years of 1848/49 in order to write a constitution for a united Germany. The attempt failed because the monarchs of [[Prussia]] and Austria did not want to lose power. In 1849, Prussian troops ended the democratic experiment by force and the parliament dissolved; the building was once more used for religious services.

St. Paul's was partially destroyed in World War II with its interior significantly damaged. It was quickly and symbolically rebuilt after the war albeit with modern alterations particularly to the interior; today it is used mainly for exhibitions and events.

'''Archäologischer Garten Frankfurt'''

The Archaeological Garden contains small parts of the oldest recovered buildings: an ancient Roman settlement and the Frankfurt Royal Palace (''Kaiserpfalz Frankfurt'') from the sixth century. The garden is located between the Römerberg and the cathedral. It was discovered after World War II when the area was heavily bombed and later partly rebuilt. The remains were preserved and are now open to the public. From 2013 until 2015 an event building, the Stadthaus ("City house"), has been built on top of the garden, but it remains open to the public free of charge.

'''Haus Wertheim'''

Wertheim House is the only [[Timber framing|timbered house]] in the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] district that survived the heavy bombings of World War II undamaged. It is located on the Römerberg next to the Historical Museum.

'''Saalhof'''

The [[Saalhof]] is the oldest conserved building in the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] district and dates to the 12th century. It was used as an exhibition hall by Dutch [[cloth merchant|clothiers]] when trade fairs were held during the 14th and 15th centuries. The Saalhof was partly destroyed in World War II and later rebuilt. Today it serves as a part of the [[Historical museum, Frankfurt|Historical Museum]].

'''Eiserner Steg'''

The Eiserner Steg (Iron Bridge) is a pedestrian-only bridge across the Main that connects Römerberg and Sachsenhausen. It was built in 1868 and was the second bridge to cross the river. After World War II, when it was blown up by the [[Wehrmacht]], it was quickly rebuilt in 1946. Today some 10,000 people cross the bridge on a daily basis.

'''Alte Oper'''
[[File:Alte Oper Frankfurt Winter 2008.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Alte Oper]], now a concert hall, at Opernplatz]]
The [[Alte Oper]] is a former [[opera house]], hence the name "Old Opera". The opera house was built in 1880 by architect Richard Lucae. It was one of the major opera houses in Germany until it was heavily damaged in World War II. Until the late 1970s, it was a ruin, nicknamed "Germany's most beautiful ruin". Former Frankfurt [[Lord Mayor]] Rudi Arndt called for blowing it up in the 1960s, which earned him the nickname "Dynamite-Rudi". (Later on, Arndt said he never had meant his suggestion seriously.)

Public pressure led to its refurbishment and reopening in 1981. Today, it functions as a famous concert hall, while operas are performed at the "new" Frankfurt Opera. The inscription on the [[frieze]] of the Alte Oper says: "''Dem Wahren, Schönen, Guten''" ("To the true, the beautiful, the good").

'''Eschenheimer Turm'''

The Eschenheim Tower (''[[Eschenheimer Turm]]'') was erected at the beginning of the 15th century and served as a city gate as part of late-medieval fortifications. It is the oldest and most unaltered building in the [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Innenstadt]] district.

'''[[St. Catherine's Church, Frankfurt|St. Catherine's Church]]'''

St. Catherine's Church (''Katharinenkirche'') is the largest [[Protestant Church in Germany|Protestant]] church, dedicated to [[Catherine of Alexandria]], a [[martyr]]ed early Christian saint. It is located downtown at the entrance to the Zeil, the central pedestrian shopping street.

'''Hauptwache'''

Although today [[Hauptwache (Frankfurt am Main)|Hauptwache]] is mostly associated with the inner-city underground train station [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptwache station|of the same name]], the name originates from a [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] building on the square above the station. The Hauptwache building was constructed in 1730 and was used as a prison, therefore the name that translates as "main guard-house". Today the square surrounding the building is also called "Hauptwache" (formal: ''An der Hauptwache''). It is situated downtown opposite to St. Catherine's Church and houses a famous café.

'''Central Station'''

[[Frankfurt Central Station]] (''Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof''), which opened in 1888, was built as the central train station for Frankfurt to replace three smaller downtown train stations and to boost the needed capacity for travellers. It was constructed as a [[Terminal station|terminus station]] and was the largest train station in Europe by floor area until 1915 when [[Leipzig Hauptbahnhof|Leipzig Central Station]] was opened. Its three main halls were constructed in a [[Renaissance Revival architecture|neorenaissance]]-style, while the later enlargement with two outer halls in 1924 was constructed in [[neoclassicism|neoclassic]]-style.

'''Frankfurter Hof'''

The Frankfurter Hof is a landmark downtown hotel at Kaiserplatz, built from 1872 to 1876. It is part of [[Steigenberger Hotels]] group and is considered the city's most prestigious.

'''St. Leonhard'''

[[St. Leonhard, Frankfurt|St. Leonhard]], on the Main close to the bridge Eiserner Steg, is a Catholic [[Gothic architecture|late Gothic]] [[hall church]], derived from a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]] [[basilica]] beginning in 1425. It is the only one of nine churches in the Old Town that survived World War II almost undamaged. The parish serves the English-speaking community. The church has been under restoration from 2011 until 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.fr.de/frankfurt/frankfurt-leonhardskirche-oeffnet-nach-sanierung-wieder-11765613.html |title=Gläubige dürfen zurück in uralte Leonhardskirche in Frankfurt |date=15 February 2019 |access-date=14 December 2020 |archive-date=27 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210427223541/https://www.fr.de/frankfurt/frankfurt-leonhardskirche-oeffnet-nach-sanierung-wieder-11765613.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===History of high-rise buildings===
{{see also|List of tallest buildings in Frankfurt}}
[[File:Frankfurt Skyline (16259801511).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Skyline at dusk, seen from Deutschherrnbrücke (2014)]]
For centuries, [[Frankfurt Cathedral|St. Bartholomeus's Cathedral]] was the tallest structure. The first building to exceed the 95-meter-high cathedral was not an office building but a [[grain silo]], the {{cvt|120|m|ft|adj=mid|-high|sp=us}} [[Henninger Turm]], built from 1959 to 1961.

The first high-rise building boom came in the 1970s when [[Westend Gate]] (then called ''Plaza Büro Center'') and [[Silberturm]] were constructed and became the tallest buildings in Germany with a height of 159.3 meters and 166.3 meters, respectively. Around the same time, [[Frankfurter Büro Center]] and [[City-Haus]] (142.4 meters and 142.1 meters) were constructed at Mainzer Landstraße and [[Eurotower (Frankfurt)|Eurotower]] (148.0 meters) and [[Garden Tower]] (127.0 meters; then called ''Helaba-Hochhaus'') were constructed in the financial district.

None of the buildings constructed during the 1980s surpassed Silberturm. The most famous buildings from this decade are the [[Deutsche Bank Twin Towers]] at Taunusanlage, both 155.0 meters tall.

The 1990s featured a second wave. [[Messeturm]], built on the trade fair site, reached a height of {{convert|256.5|m|sp=us}} and became the tallest building in Europe by 1991. It was overtaken by the {{cvt|259|m|ft|adj=mid|-high|sp=us}} [[Commerzbank Tower]] in 1997. Other tall buildings from this decade are [[Westendstrasse 1]] ({{convert|208|m|sp=us}}), [[Main Tower]] ({{convert|200|m|sp=us}}) and [[Trianon (Frankfurt am Main)|Trianon]] ({{convert|186|m|sp=us}}).

In 21st-century Frankfurt, more high-rise buildings and skyscrapers (e.g., [[Skyper]], [[Opernturm]], [[Tower 185]], [[Seat of the European Central Bank]], [[Taunusturm]]) emerged, but none have surpassed Commerzbank Tower.

===Other tall structures===
[[File:Europaturm Abend.jpg|thumb|right|Top of the [[Europaturm]], a {{cvt|337|m|ft}} communications tower]]
*'''[[Europaturm]] —''' The Europe Tower is a [[Radio masts and towers|telecommunications tower]], also known as the Frankfurt TV Tower, built from 1974 to 1979. With a height of 337.5 meters it is the tallest tower and the second tallest structure in Germany after the [[Fernsehturm Berlin]]. It was open to the public until 1999, with an entertainment establishment in the revolving top. It is normally referred to by locals as the "Ginnheimer Spargel" (''Ginnheim Asparagus''), but stands a few meters within [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bockenheim]] district.
*'''[[Henninger Turm]] —''' The Henninger Tower was a 120-mete-high [[grain silo]] built from 1959 to 1961 and owned by [[Henninger Brewery]]. It was the highest structure until 1974. The Henninger Tower had two rotating restaurants at the height of 101 and 106 meters and an open-air observation deck at the height of 110 meters. The tower closed to the public in October 2002 and was demolished in 2013 to be replaced by a 140&nbsp;m (459&nbsp;ft) tall residential tower, which is externally inspired by the old Henninger Turm. The cornerstone for this project was laid in June 2014 and construction was completed in summer 2017. The new tower offers 207 luxury flats<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.baunetz.de/meldungen/Meldungen-Baubeginn_fuer_Henninger-Turm_in_Frankfurt_3947903.html |title=Transformation des Bestands – Baubeginn für Henninger-Turm in Frankfurt |date=27 June 2014 |access-date=14 December 2020 |archive-date=17 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210417234649/https://www.baunetz.de/meldungen/Meldungen-Baubeginn_fuer_Henninger-Turm_in_Frankfurt_3947903.html |url-status=live }}</ref> and houses the non-rotating restaurant "Franziska". From 1962 to 2008 a famous yearly [[Road bicycle racing|cycling race]] was named after the tower, the "Radrennen Rund um den Henninger Turm" (''Cycling race around Henninger Tower''). The now-renamed race is still a yearly event.
*'''[[Goethe Tower|Goetheturm]] –''' The Goethe Tower was a {{cvt|43|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} tower on the northern edge of the [[Frankfurt City Forest]] in [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]]. It was the fifth tallest wood construction structure in Germany. It was built in 1931 and was a popular place for day-trippers until it burned down in 2017. A faithful reconstruction has been opened to the public on 12 October 2020, exactly three years after the original's destruction.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hessenschau.de/panorama/der-neue-goetheturm-wird-ganz-wie-der-alte,goetheturm-wiederaufbau-100.html |title=Der neue Goetheturm wird ganz wie der alte |date=3 November 2017 |publisher=Hessenschau |access-date=17 November 2017 |language=de |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118195740/http://www.hessenschau.de/panorama/der-neue-goetheturm-wird-ganz-wie-der-alte,goetheturm-wiederaufbau-100.html |archive-date=18 November 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Shopping streets===
[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Zeil-Ansicht vom Maintower am fruehen Abend-20110328.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Zeil]], Frankfurt's central shopping street]]
*'''[[Zeil]]''' – Frankfurt's central shopping street. It is a pedestrian-only area and is bordered by two large public squares, [[Hauptwache (Frankfurt am Main)|Hauptwache]] in the west and [[Konstablerwache]] in the east. It is the second most expensive street for shops to rent in Germany after the [[Kaufingerstraße]] in Munich. 85 percent of the shops are retail chains such as [[H&M]], [[Saturn (store)|Saturn]], [[Esprit Holdings|Esprit]], [[Zara (retailer)|Zara]] or [[NewYorker]]. In 2009 a new shopping mall named [[MyZeil]] opened there with nearly 100 stores and chains like [[Hollister Co.|Hollister]]. Three more shopping malls occupy the Zeil: UpperZeil (replacing the [[Zeilgalerie]], which was demolished in 2016), [[Metro AG|Galeria Kaufhof]] and [[Arcandor|Karstadt]], as well as large fashion retail clothing stores from [[Peek & Cloppenburg]] and [[C&A]]. During the month before Christmas, the extended pedestrian-only zone is host to [[Frankfurt Christmas Market]], one of the largest and oldest Christmas markets in Germany.
*'''[[Goethestraße]]''' – Frankfurt's most expensive shopping street with prestigious shops like [[Louis Vuitton]], [[Prada]], [[Gucci]], [[Tiffany & Co.|Tiffany]], [[Giorgio Armani]], [[Versace]], [[Cartier SA|Cartier]], [[Burberry]], [[Vertu]] and [[Bulgari]]. It is located between the financial district and downtown, running from Goetheplatz to Opernplatz.
*'''[[Freßgass]]''' – (officially ''Kalbächer Gasse'' and ''Große Bockenheimer Straße'') is a central pedestrian-only street section between Börsenstraße and Opernplatz. The name translates as "feeding alley" because of its high concentration of gastronomy, but lately prestigious shops (e.g., [[Apple Store]], [[Hugo Boss]], [[Porsche Design Group|Porsche Design]]) have moved here due to the lack of space in the neighboring [[Goethestraße]], displacing old, established restaurants, butchers and delicatessens.
*'''Berger Straße''' – Frankfurt's longest shopping street. It starts in the city center, runs through [[Nordend, Frankfurt|Nordend]] and [[Bornheim (Frankfurt)|Bornheim]] and ends in [[Seckbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Seckbach]]. The street is less crowded than the Zeil and offers a greater variety of smaller shops, restaurants and cafés.
*'''Leipziger Straße''' – Central shopping street in the Bockenheim district starting at Bockenheimer Warte going towards West. High density of shops for daily needs. 
*'''Braubachstraße''' – In the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] district, close to the historic sites of the city, offers a large variety of art galleries, second-hand bookshops and antique shops.
*'''Münchener Straße''' – In the [[Bahnhofsviertel (Frankfurt am Main)|Bahnhofsviertel]] district, located between the central station and Willy-Brandt-Platz, is the most multicultural shopping street with many shops selling imported products mainly from Turkey, the Middle East and Asia.
*'''Kaiserstraße''' – One of the best-known streets and considered one of the most beautiful because of its amount of [[Gründerzeit]]-style buildings. It runs parallel to Münchener Straße from the central station to the financial district. Kaiserstraße is still a synonym for Frankfurt's [[Red-light district]] although [[Sex industry|sex-oriented businesses]] moved to neighboring streets such as {{ill|Taunusstrasse|de|Taunusstraße}} in the 1990s. Today Kaiserstraße houses many small shops, restaurants and cafés.
*'''Kleinmarkthalle''' – (literally: ''Small Market Hall'') is a market hall close to Konstablerwache square offering fresh food and flowers. In addition to regional delicacies like [[green sauce]] imported goods are offered. The Kleinmarkthalle is the largest public marketplace in Frankfurt.

===Green city===
[[File:FFM_Jacobiweiher_Uferblick_von_NO_1.jpg|thumb|[[Frankfurt City Forest]]]]
With a large forest, many parks, the Main riverbanks and the two botanical gardens, Frankfurt is considered a "green city": More than 50 percent of the area within the city limits are protected green areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2855&_ffmpar&#91;_id_inhalt&#93;=7187755 |title=Auf dem Weg zur Green City |publisher=Frankfurt.de |access-date=4 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180927124027/https://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2855&_ffmpar%255B_id_inhalt%255D=7187755 |archive-date=27 September 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

*'''Frankfurter Grüngürtel''' – The Green Belt is a ring-shaped public green space around the city. With 8,000 [[Hectare|ha]] it covers a third of the administrative area. It includes the Frankfurter Stadtwald (''[[Frankfurt City Forest]]'', Germany's largest forest within a city), the Schwanheimer Düne (''[[Schwanheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Schwanheim]] [[Dune]]''), the Niddatal (''[[Nidda (river)|Nidda]] [[Valley]]''), the Niddapark, the Lohrberg (''Lohr Mountain'', Frankfurt's only [[vineyard]]), the Huthpark, the Enkheimer Ried (''[[Frankfurt-Bergen-Enkheim|Enkheim]] [[Marsh]]''), the Seckbacher Ried (''[[Seckbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Seckbach]] [[Marsh]]'') and the Fechenheimer Mainbogen (a S-shaped part of the [[Main (river)|Main]] river in [[Fechenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Fechenheim]]). The Green Belt is a [[protected area]] which means that housing is not allowed. The Green Belt was formally created in 1991 with its own constitution.
*'''Mainuferpark''' – The Mainuferpark (''Main Riverbanks Park'') is the common term to describe the inner-city Main riverbanks. It is an auto-free zone with large green areas that is popular with strollers and tourists, especially in the summertime, when it can become crowded. The southern riverbank, which continues further to [[Offenbach am Main]] and [[Hanau]], offers the best skyline views. The northern riverbank ends in the west at the former Westhafen (''West Harbor'', a residential housing area) and is growing to the east: A former industrial-used area between the new [[Seat of the European Central Bank]] and the Osthafen (''East Harbor'') has become a park named Hafenpark (''Harbor Park''), which offers outdoor courts for basketball, soccer and a skatepark.
*'''Wallanlagen''' – The [[Wallanlagen]] (former ''[[Defensive wall|ramparts]]'') relate to the former ring-shaped [[Defensive wall|city wall fortifications]] around the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] and the [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Innenstadt]] district (abolished 1804–1812), now a series of parks. Building is not allowed, with a few exceptions, the most famous being the [[Alte Oper]] (built 1880) at the Opernplatz. The part between the northern Main riverbank and the Opernplatz, referred to officially as Taunusanlage and Gallusanlage, is locally known as "Central Park" (a reference to the [[Central Park|famous park]] in [[Manhattan]]), because of the skyscrapers which stand on both sides.
*'''Nizza Park''' – At the juncture of the northern Main riverbank and the Wallanlagen is a famous small park called Nizza. The name of the park recalls [[Nice]] in southern France, because it is one of the warmest areas with a nearly [[mediterranean climate]]. Numerous [[Mediterranean flora]] grow there and can survive outside during the winter.
*'''Garten des Himmlischen Friedens''' – "Garden of Heavenly Peace", named after the [[Tiananmen Square|Tiananmen Gate]] in Beijing, is a Chinese-styled park in the [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Nordend]] district and part of the larger Bethmannpark. It contains Chinese buildings, with building materials imported from China and built by Chinese workers in the 1980s. Hosts traditional Chinese plants and herbs.
*'''Other parks''' – The largest parks are the Niddapark (168 ha), the Ostpark (32 ha) and the [[Grüneburgpark]] (29 ha).

===Performing arts===
====Music====
[[Eurodance]] and [[Trance music]] originated in Frankfurt. In 1989 German producers Michael Münzing and Luca Anzilotti (under the pseudonyms Benito Benites and John "Virgo" Garrett III) formed the [[Snap!]] project. Snap! songs combined [[Hip hop music|Rap]] and [[Soul music|Soul]] vocals adding rhythm by using computer technology and mixing electronic sounds, bass and drums. By doing so a new genre was born: Eurodance.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Neue Ehrlichkeit.

The [[Bundesautobahn 661]] (A661) is mainly a commuter motorway that starts in the south (Egelsbach), runs through the eastern part and ends in the north ([[Oberursel]]). The [[Bundesautobahn 648]] (A648) is a very short motorway in the western part which primarily serves as a fast connection between the A 66 and the [[Frankfurt Trade Fair]]. The A5 in the west, the A3 in the south and the A661 in the northeast form a [[ring road]] around the inner city districts and define a [[Low-emission zone]] (''Umweltzone''; established in 2008), meaning that vehicles have to meet certain emission criteria to enter the zone.

The streets of central Frankfurt are usually congested with cars during [[rush hour]]. Some areas, especially around the shopping streets Zeil, Goethestraße and Freßgass, are pedestrian-only streets.

===Railway stations===
====Frankfurt Central Station====
[[File:Hauptbahnhof Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof|Frankfurt Central Station]]]]

It is a stop for most of ICE high-speed lines, making it Germany's most important ICE station. ICE Trains to London via the [[Channel Tunnel]] were planned for 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/travel/travel-news/highspeed-trains-to-link-england-and-germany-20111013-1lmq8.html |title=High-speed trains to link England and Germany |publisher=Brisbanetimes.com.au |date=16 October 2011 |access-date=16 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621035917/http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/travel/travel-news/highspeed-trains-to-link-england-and-germany-20111013-1lmq8.html |archive-date=21 June 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> All [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn]] lines, two [[Frankfurt U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] lines (U4, U5), several tram and bus lines stop there. Regional and local trains are integrated in the Public transport system [[Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund]] (RMV), the second-largest integrated public transport systems in the world, after [[Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg]].

====Frankfurt Airport stations====
[[File:DSCI0058 Flughafen Frankfurt Squaire.jpg|thumb|[[ICE 3]] departing westward from [[Frankfurt Airport long-distance station]] underneath [[The Squaire]]]]
Frankfurt Airport can be accessed by two railway stations: [[Frankfurt Airport long-distance station]] (''Frankfurt Flughafen Fernbahnhof'') is only for long-distance traffic and connects the airport to the main rail network, with most of the [[InterCityExpress|ICE]] services using the [[Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed rail line]]. The long-distance station is located outside the actual airport ground but has a connecting bridge for pedestrians to Terminal 1, concourse B. [[Frankfurt Airport regional station]] (''Frankfurt Flughafen Regionalbahnhof'') is for local [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] trains (lines S8, S9) and regional trains. The regional station is located within Terminal 1, concourse B.

====Frankfurt South station====
Frankfurt's third long-distance station is [[Frankfurt South station]] (''Frankfurt Südbahnhof'', often abbreviated as ''Frankfurt (Main) Süd'' or ''F-Süd''), located in [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]]. It is an important destination for local trains and trams (lines 15, 16 and 18) and the terminal stop for four U-Bahn lines (U1, U2, U3, U8) as well as two S-Bahn lines (S5, S6). Two other S-Bahn lines (S3, S4) also serve the station.

====Messe stations====
The [[Frankfurt Trade Fair]] offers two railway stations: [[Frankfurt Messe station|Messe station]] is for local [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] trains (lines S3-S6) and is centrally located amid trade fair premises, while Festhalle/Messe station is served by U-Bahn line U4 and is located at the north-east corner of the premises.

====Konstablerwache station and Hauptwache station====
Two other major downtown railway stations are Konstablerwache and Hauptwache, located on each end of the Zeil. They are the main stations to change from east-to-west-bound S-Bahn trains to north-to-south-bound U-Bahn trains. Konstablerwache station is the second-busiest railway station regarding daily passenger volume (191,000) after the central station. The third-busiest railway station is Hauptwache station (181,000).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.howtogermany.com/pages/frankfurt.html |title=How to Germany – Frankfurt am Main: The Gateway to Germany |access-date=6 October 2020 |archive-date=26 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926095555/https://www.howtogermany.com/pages/frankfurt.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://addr.ws/frankfurt-konstablerwache-station-train-station--frankfurt-de.html |title=Frankfurt Konstablerwache station |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128114229/https://addr.ws/frankfurt-konstablerwache-station-train-station--frankfurt-de.html |archive-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>

===Coach stations===
There are three stations for [[intercity bus service]]s in Frankfurt: one at the south side of the Central Station, one at the Terminal 2 of the airport and another one at Stephanstraße.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.travelinho.com/en/travel/frankfurt |title=Frankfurt: Stations |publisher=Travelinho.com |access-date=21 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201044654/http://www.travelinho.com/en/travel/frankfurt |archive-date=1 December 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Public transport===
{{Main|Public transport in Frankfurt am Main}}
[[File:Frankfurt am Main - Netzplan Schienennahverkehr.png|thumb|Public transport network]]
The city has two [[rapid transit]] systems: the U-Bahn and the S-Bahn, as well as an above-ground tram system. Information about the U- and S-Bahn can be found on the website of the [[Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund|RMV]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rmv.de/coremedia/generator/RMV/Sprachen/SPRACH__ART__en.html |title=Rhein-Main Transport Association |publisher=RMV.DE |date=24 November 2010 |access-date=10 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727002756/http://www.rmv.de/coremedia/generator/RMV/Sprachen/SPRACH__ART__en.html |archive-date=27 July 2010}}</ref>

====S-Bahn====
{{main|Rhine-Main S-Bahn}}
Nine [[S-Bahn]] lines (S1 to S9) connect Frankfurt with the densely populated [[Frankfurt Rhein-Main Region|Rhine Main Region]]. Most routes have at least 15-minute service during the day, either by one line running every 15 minutes, or by two lines servicing one route at a 30-minute interval. All lines, except line S7, run through the Frankfurt city tunnel and serve the stations [[Frankfurt Ostendstraße station|Ostendstraße]], [[Frankfurt (Main) Konstablerwache station|Konstablerwache]], [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptwache station|Hauptwache]], [[Taunusanlage station|Taunusanlage]] and [[Frankfurt Central Station]]. When leaving the city the S-Bahn travels above ground. It provides access to the trade fair (S3, S4, S5, S6), the airport (S8, S9), the stadium (S7, S8, S9) and nearby cities such as [[Wiesbaden]], [[Mainz]], [[Darmstadt]], [[Rüsselsheim]], [[Hanau]], [[Offenbach am Main]], [[Oberursel]], [[Bad Homburg]], [[Kronberg]], [[Friedberg, Hesse|Friedberg]] and smaller towns that are on the way.
The S8/S9 runs 24/7.

====U-Bahn====
[[File:DSC03475 B44 Ludwig-Landmann-Straße.jpg|thumb|Underground line ''U7'' running as a ''[[Stadtbahn]]'' amidst [[Ludwig Landmann|Ludwig-Landmann]]-Straße in [[Rödelheim|Frankfurt-Rödelheim]]]]
{{main|Frankfurt U-Bahn}}
The [[U-Bahn]] has nine lines (U1 to U9) serving Frankfurt and the larger suburbs of Bad Homburg and Oberursel in the north. The trains that run on the U-Bahn are in fact [[light rail]] (''[[Stadtbahn]]'') as many lines travel along a track in the middle of the street instead of underground. The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs at 7.5- to 10-minute intervals, which produce between 3- and 5-minute intervals on downtown tracks shared by more than one line.

====Tram====
{{main|Trams in Frankfurt am Main}}
Frankfurt has ten tram lines (11, 12, 14 to 21), with trams arriving usually every 10 minutes. Many sections are served by two lines, combining to run at 5-minute intervals during rush-hour. Trams only run above ground and serve more stops than the U-Bahn or the S-Bahn.

====Bus====
{{main|Public transport in Frankfurt am Main#Bus}}
A number of bus lines complete the Frankfurt public transport system. Night buses replace U-Bahn and tram services between 1:30&nbsp;am and 3:30&nbsp;am.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nachtbus-frankfurt.de |title=Nightbus Frankfurt Rheinmain |publisher=Nachtbus-frankfurt.de |access-date=10 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430194211/http://www.nachtbus-frankfurt.de/ |archive-date=30 April 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The central junction for the night bus service is at the downtown square of Konstablerwache, where all night bus lines start and end.

===Taxis===
[[Taxicab]]s can usually be found outside the major S-Bahn and U-Bahn stations, at the central station, the south station, the airport, the trade fair and in the crowded inner-city shopping streets. The common way to obtain a taxi is to either call a taxi operator or to go to a taxi rank. However, although not the norm, one can hail a passing taxi on the street.

[[Uber]] ceased operations in Frankfurt on 9 November 2015 after operating in the city for 18 months.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Uber Pulls Out of Three German Cities After Court Ban Shrinks Driver Pool |url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/02/uber-retrenches-in-germany/ |first=Natasha |last=Lomas |work=[[TechCrunch]] |date=2 November 2015 |access-date=25 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170528205741/https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/02/uber-retrenches-in-germany/ |archive-date=28 May 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> However, [[UberX]] and local cabs are available through the Uber app.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Frankfurt: a guide for getting around in the city |url=https://www.uber.com/global/en/cities/frankfurt/ |access-date=6 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170528205741/https://www.uber.com/global/en/cities/frankfurt/ |archive-date=28 May 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Bicycles===
[[File:Frankfurt Velotaxi.jpg|thumb|Velotaxi at the Zeil]]
[[Deutsche Bahn]] makes bicycles available for hire through their [[Call a Bike]] service. The bicycles are stationed all over the city, including at selected railway stations. They can easily be spotted because of their eye-catching silver-red color. To rent a specific bike, riders either call a service number to get an unlock code or reserve the bike via the smartphone application. To return the bike, the rider locks it within a designated return area (and calls the service number, if not booked via the app).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.callabike-interaktiv.de/ |title=Call a Bike: Startseite |work=callabike-interaktiv.de |access-date=28 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924030211/http://www.callabike-interaktiv.de/ |archive-date=24 September 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Nextbike]] also makes bicycles available for hire in Frankfurt. They are stationed all over the city. These can be spotted with their blue color scheme.

[[Cycle rickshaw]]s (velotaxis), a type of [[tricycle]] designed to carry passengers in addition to the driver, are also available. These are allowed to operate in pedestrian-only areas and are therefore practical for sightseeing.

Frankfurt has a network of cycle routes. Many long-distance bike routes into the city have cycle tracks that are separate from motor vehicle traffic. A number of downtown roads are "bicycle streets" where the cyclist has the right of way and where motorized vehicles are only allowed access if they do not disrupt the cycle users. In addition, cyclists are allowed to ride many cramped one-way streets in both directions. {{As of|2015}}, 15 percent of citizens used bicycles.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Radfahrbüro der Stadt Frankfurt |url=http://www.radfahren-ffm.de/ |website=www.radfahren-ffm.de |access-date = 5 September 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091112051827/http://www.radfahren-ffm.de/ |archive-date = 12 November 2009 |url-status = live}}</ref>

===E-Scooters===
Since 15 June 2019, the use of [[e-scooters]] was officially permitted by the German federal government. In Frankfurt, companies like [[Lime (transportation company)|Lime]], TIER, [[Bird (transportation company)|Bird]], voi., [[Dott (transportation company)|Dott]] or [[Bolt (company)|Bolt]] are offering their electric micro mobility vehicles for lease. However, their use is being regarded with increasing weariness due to frequent abuse (parking, speeding, vandalism, accidents) and has sparked a public debate about the need of further regulation of the e-scooter market.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Frankfurt sagt E-Scooter-Rüpeln den Kampf an |url=https://www.fnp.de/frankfurt/frankfurt-sagt-scooter-ruepeln-den-kampf-an-91280428.html/ |date=3 February 2022 |access-date=6 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220203212742/https://www.fnp.de/frankfurt/frankfurt-sagt-scooter-ruepeln-den-kampf-an-91280428.html |archive-date=3 February 2022 |url-status=live}}</ref>
