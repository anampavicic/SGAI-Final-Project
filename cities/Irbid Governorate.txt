==History==

=== Iron Age ===
{{Full article|Gilead}}
During the [[Iron Age]], the region around Irbid, known then as [[Gilead]], was settled by the [[Israelites]].<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Finkelstein|first1=Israel|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1101929531|title=Ugarit-Forschungen ; Band 43 (2011)|last2=Lipschits|first2=Oded|last3=Koch|first3=Ido|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=978-3-86835-086-9|location=[Erscheinungsort nicht ermittelbar]|pages=151|chapter=The Biblical Gilead: Observations on Identifications, Geographic Divisions and Territorial History.|oclc=1101929531}}</ref> [[Ar-Ramtha]], the second largest city in the Irbid Governorate,<ref>{{cite web|title=Population of Jordan 2017|url=http://dosweb.dos.gov.jo/DataBank/Population_Estimares/2017/PopulationEstimatesbyLocality.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180825062939/http://dosweb.dos.gov.jo/DataBank/Population_Estimares/2017/PopulationEstimatesbyLocality.pdf|archive-date=25 August 2018|access-date=1 November 2018}}</ref> is commonly identified with the Israelite city of [[Ramoth-Gilead]], a [[Levitical city]] and city of refuge east of the Jordan River, mentioned several times in the [[Hebrew Bible]].<ref>Knauf, E.

By the late Iron Age, Gilead became the focus of a power struggle between the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] and the [[Arameans|Aramean]] kingdom of Aram-Damascus.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Na'aman|first=Nadav|date=1995|title=Rezin of Damascus and the Land of Gilead|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/27931518|journal=Zeitschrift des Deutschen Palästina-Vereins|volume=111|issue=2|pages=105–117|jstor=27931518 |issn=0012-1169}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967957191|title=In search for Aram and Israel : politics, culture, and identity|date=2016|others=Omer Sergi, Manfred Oeming, Izaak J. de Hulster|isbn=978-3-16-153803-2|location=Tübingen|oclc=967957191}}</ref> According to the [[Books of Kings]], Ramoth-Gilead was the location of a battle between [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] and [[Aram Damascus]]. During the battle, King [[Ahab]] of Israel joined King [[Jehoshaphat]] of Judah to fights the Aramaeans but was hit by an arrow and died from his wounds. Later on, it was also the location of a battle where [[Ahaziah of Israel]] and [[Jehoram of Judah]] fought against [[Hazael]], king of Aram Damascus, and Jehoram was wounded. In this city, [[Jehu]], the son of Jehoshaphat, was anointed by [[Elisha]].

In the 8th century BCE, the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]] gained control of the area, followed by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonian]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire]].

=== Classical antiquity ===
{{Full article|Decapolis}}
The region was later distinguished by the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[civilization]]s, leaving behind them historical and archaeological sites. [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Greece|Greek]] cities such as [[Arabella]] (Irbid), [[Capitolias]] (Beit–Ras), [[Dion, Jordan|Dion]] ([[Al Hisn]]) that contains the Roman artificial hill and small Roman lake (water reservoir), [[Gadara]] (Umm Qais), [[Pella]] (Tabeqt Fahel) and [[Abila (Decapolis)|Abila]] (Qwailbeh) were established. They were members of the [[Decapolis]]: a pact that consists of the ten Roman cities in the [[Al-Turrah|area]]. [[Ghassanid]]s had established their country in the north of Jordan covering Irbid, [[Golan]] and [[Hauran|Horan]] plains. It was described as the most beautiful Syrian countries. Also it had the Islamic soldiers’ supplies. Christianity spread out there in the second and the third century CE.

=== Middle Ages ===
With the conversion work of Islam, the Islamic opening armies achieved an advance. As a result, [[Shurahbil ibn Hasana|Sharhabeel Bin Hasnaa]] made an Islamic victory in 634 CE (13 AH). He opened Irbid, Beit-Ras and Umm Qais. The Islamic leader Abu Obideh Amer Bin Al-Jarrah was able to open Pella. In 636 CE (15 AH) and in the prime of these victories, Khalid Bin Al-Walid managed to crush out the Roman armies in the long [[Battle of Yarmouk]]. Consequently, he managed to put an end to the Roman presence in the area. In 1187 CE (583 AH) [[Saladin]]'s armies advanced to [[Hittin]] in which the most ferocious battle in the history of the [[Crusades]] took place, This battle was followed by recapturing [[Jerusalem]] and the whole region was gradually taken by the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubids]].

During the [[Mamluk]] period, Irbid played an important role as a stopping point for the pilgrims’ caravans coming from [[Turkey]], north of [[Iraq]] and south of [[Russia]]. It was an important communication hub and a gateway to [[Egypt]], [[Hijaz]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] coast, especially during the time in which Irbid was linked with [[Damascus]], which had a positive effect on the cultural and scientific movement of Irbid, as referred by historical writings. In addition to the spread of a number of scientists and Islamic [[jurisprudence]] scholars, the Islamic expansion left many graves of the companions of [[Muhammad]], many mosques and Islamic buildings such as Dar Assaraya (the former prison) which has been converted into a museum, Hibras Mamluk Mosque, Irbid Mamluke Mosque and Saham Umayyed Mosque.
