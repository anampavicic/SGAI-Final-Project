Gusau district was one of the Districts that emerged following the jihad movement of the nineteenth century in Hausa land, led by the legendary Sheikh [[Usman dan Fodio]]. It was founded around 1799 by Mallam Muhammadu Sambo Dan Ashafa, a disciple of dan Fodio. Gusau district only became prominent after the fall of Yandoto in 1806.
Since its emergence as an important settlement in the [[Sokoto Caliphate]], Gusau town attracted attention as an important agricultural and commercial center. At any rate, the town and its surrounding areas had attracted large presence of agriculturists; farmers and livestock rearers, especially cattle owning Fulani.

Gusau before the colonial period, was an [[agrarian society]], agriculture was the backbone of the economy of the Gusau, the economic activity of the people during this period consisted mainly in farming with other minor supplementary occupation, Although, like most other Hausa town’s agriculture remained the main activity. In the area there were builders, [[Thatching|thatches]], [[Butcher|butchers]], [[Blacksmith|blacksmiths]], [[Drummer|drummers]], praise-singers, etc.

Gusau and the territory assigned to Mallam Sambo Dan Ashafa falls within the metropolitan section of the caliphate. In Gusau after the consolidation of Mallam Sambo with their Headquarters at Gusau had under the territories of Wonaka, Mada, Yandoto, Samri, Magami, Marabu, Mareri, Mutumji, Kwaren Ganuwa, Wanke and a group of villages around Gusau, like other parts of the caliphate.

In territorial administration besides the fief holders in the outlying territory, the town was broken into five wards namely, Shiyar Magaji, Uban Dawaki, Galadima, Mayana and Sarkin Fada. They were the vital links between the people in their respective wards and the Sarkin katsinan Gusau (Emir Of Gusau). They are the eyes and ears of Sarki. Gusau like other parts of the Caliphate send a share of its revenue to the Sultan Of Sokoto.

The coming of [[colonialism]] brought about certain developments and transformations of the societies in Gusau. Colonial infrastructures such as tarred [[Road|roads]], [[Rail transport|railways]], modern stores, businesses as well as modern manufactures were all brought to the town. Similarly, modern residences, offices, schools and hospital were added to the town which aided and further enhanced, its expansion and modernization process.

However, there are colonial policies that were introduced by the colonial administration which changed the system of political administration. The Gusau area is something of an anachronism. It was not a division but is treated as such in all respects politically, in which respect it has the status of a touring area.
