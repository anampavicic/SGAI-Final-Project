'''Tashkent''' ({{IPAc-en|t|æ|ʃ|ˈ|k|ɛ|n|t}}),{{efn|{{IPAc-en|USalso|t|ɑː|ʃ|ˈ|k|ɛ|n|t}}}} or '''Toshkent''' in [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]],{{efn|{{IPAc-en|t|ɒ|ʃ|ˈ|k|ɛ|n|t}}; {{lang-uz|Toshkent, Тошкент}}/ {{lang|uz-Arab|تاشکند}}, {{IPA-uz|tɒʃˈkent|IPA}}}} is the [[Capital city|capital]] and [[List of cities in Uzbekistan|largest city]] of [[Uzbekistan]].{{efn|The city was historically known as ''Chach'', ''Shash'', or ''Binkat''}} It is the most populous city in [[Central Asia]], with a population of more than 3 million people as of April 1st 2024.<ref name=toshstat/> It is located in northeastern Uzbekistan, near the border with [[Kazakhstan]].

Before the influence of [[Islam]] in the mid-8th century AD, [[Sogdian people|Sogdian]] and [[Turkic people|Turkic]] culture was predominant. After [[Genghis Khan]] destroyed the city in 1219, it was rebuilt and profited from its location on the [[Silk Road]]. From the 18th to the 19th centuries, the city became an [[Tashkent (1784)|independent city-state]], before being re-conquered by the [[Khanate of Kokand]]. In 1865, Tashkent fell to the [[Russian Empire]]; as a result, it became the capital of [[Russian Turkestan]]. In [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times, it witnessed major growth and demographic changes due to [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|forced deportations]] from throughout the Soviet Union. Much of Tashkent was destroyed in the [[1966 Tashkent earthquake]], but it was soon rebuilt as a model Soviet city. It was the fourth-largest city in the Soviet Union at the time, after [[Moscow]], [[Leningrad]] and [[Kyiv]].<ref>''Praying Through the 100 Gateway Cities of the 10/40 Window'', {{ISBN|978-0-927-54580-8}}, p. 89.</ref>

Today, as the capital of an independent Uzbekistan, Tashkent retains a multiethnic population, with ethnic [[Uzbeks]] as the majority. In 2009, it celebrated 2,200 years of its [[recorded history|written history]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fergananews.com/articles/6299 |title=Юбилей Ташкента.

==History==
{{For timeline}}

===Etymology===
During its long history, Tashkent has undergone various changes in names and political and religious affiliations. [[Al-Biruni|Abu Rayhan Biruni]] wrote that the city's name Tashkent comes from the turkic ''tash'' and persian ''kent'', literally translated as "Stone City" or "City of Stones".<ref>Sachau, Edward C. Alberuni's India: an Account of the Religion. Philosophy, Literature, Geography, Chronology, Astronomy, Customs, Laws and Astrology of India about AD 1030, vol. 1 London: KEGAN PAUL, TRENCH, TRtJBNBR & CO. 1910. p.298.</ref>

[[Ilya Gershevitch]] (1974:55, 72) (apud Livshits, 2007:179) traces the city's old name Chach back to [[Iranian languages#Old Iranian|Old Iranian]] *''čāiča-'' "area of water, lake" (cf. ''Čaēčista'', the [[Aral Sea]]'s name in the [[Avesta]]) (whence [[Middle Chinese]] transcription *''źiäk'' > [[standard Chinese]] ''Shí'' with [[Chinese character]] 石 for "stone"<ref>{{iranica|Čāč|Čāč}}</ref><ref>{{iranica|personal-names-sogdian-1-in-chinese-sources|Personal Names, Sogdian i. in Chinese sources}}</ref>), and *''Čačkand'' ~ ''Čačkanθ'' was the basis for [[Turkic language|Turkic]] adaptation Tashkent, popularly etymologized as "stone city".<ref name = "livshits2007">Livshits, Vladimir (2007). "The Leader of the People of Chach in Sogdian Inscriptions" in Macuch, Maggi, & Sundermann (eds.) ''Iranian Languages and Texts from Iran and Turan. Ronald E. Emmerick Memorial Volume''. p. 179</ref> Livshits proposes that ''Čač'' originally designated only the [[Aral Sea]] before being used for the Tashkent oasis.<ref name = "livshits2007"/>

Ünal (2022) critiques Gershevitch's and Livshits's etymology as being "based on too many assumptions". He instead derives the name ''Čač'' from Late [[Proto-Turkic]] *''t<sub>1</sub>iāt<sub>2</sub>(ă)'' "stone", which he proposes to be seemingly another translation, besides the apparent Chinese translation 石 ''shí'' "stone", of *''kaŋk-'' (whence Chinese transcription 康居 [[Eastern Han Chinese|EHC]] *''kʰɑŋ-kɨɑ'' > [[standard Chinese]] ''[[Kangju|Kāngjū]]''), which possibly meant "stone". Against [[Harold Walter Bailey]]'s and [[Edwin G. Pulleyblank]]'s suggested [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]] origin for *''kaŋk-'', Ünal proposes that it was instead an [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] word and compares it to [[Pashto]] ''kā́ṇay'' "stone".<ref>Ünal, Orçun (2022). [https://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp325_proto_Turkic_consonants.pdf "On *p- and Other Proto-Turkic Consonants"] ''[[Sino-Platonic Papers]]'', '''325''', pp. 45-46</ref>

===Early history===
Tashkent was first settled between the 5th and 3rd centuries BC as an [[oasis]] on the [[Chirchik River]], near the foothills of the West [[Tian Shan]] Mountains. In ancient times, this area contained Beitian, probably the summer "capital" of the [[Kangju]] confederacy.<ref>Pulleyblank, Edwin G. "The Consonantal System of Old Chinese," ''Asia Major 9'' (1963), p. 94.</ref> Some scholars believe that a "[[Stone Tower (Ptolemy)|Stone Tower]]" mentioned by [[Ptolemy]] in his famous treatise [[Geography (Ptolemy)|''Geography'']], and by other early accounts of travel on the old [[Silk Road]], referred to this settlement (due to its etymology). This tower is said to have marked the midway point between [[Europe]] and [[China]]. Other scholars, however, disagree with this identification, though it remains one of four most probable sites for the Stone Tower.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Dean |first=Riaz |title=The Stone Tower: Ptolemy, the Silk Road, and a 2,000-Year-Old Riddle |publisher=Penguin Viking |year=2022 |isbn=978-0670093625 |location=Delhi |pages=134 (Map 4), 170 |language=English}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dean |first=Riaz |date=2015 |title=The Location of Ptolemy's Stone Tower: the Case for Sulaiman-Too in Osh |journal=The Silk Road |volume=13 |pages=76}}</ref>

===History as Chach===
[[File:Chach. Uncertain ruler. Circa AD 625-725.jpg|thumb|left|Coinage of Chach circa 625-725 CE]]
In pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, the town and the province were known as ''Chach''.  The [[Shahnameh]] of [[Ferdowsi]] also refers to the city as Chach.

[[File:Ambassadors from Chaganian (central figure, inscription of the neck), and Chach (modern Tashkent) to king Varkhuman of Samarkand. 648-651 CE, Afrasiyab, Samarkand.jpg|thumb|270px|Ambassadors from [[Chaganian]] (central figure, inscription of the neck), and Chach (modern Tashkent) to king [[Varkhuman]] of [[Samarkand]]. 648-651 CE, [[Afrasiyab (Samarkand)|Afrasiyab murals]], Samarkand.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Baumer |first1=Christoph |title=History of Central Asia, The: 4-volume set |date=18 April 2018 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-1-83860-868-2 |page=243 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DhiWDwAAQBAJ&pg=RA1-PA243 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="SW">{{cite book |last1=Whitfield |first1=Susan |author-link=Susan Whitfield |title=The Silk Road: Trade, Travel, War and Faith |year=2004 |publisher=British Library.

The principality of Chach had a [[Square (geometry)|square]] citadel built around the 5th to 3rd centuries BC, some {{cvt|8|km}} south of the [[Syr Darya]] River. By the 7th century AD, Chach had more than 30 towns and a network of over 50 canals, forming a trade center between the [[Sogdiana|Sogdians]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] nomads. The [[Buddhist]] monk [[Xuanzang]] (602/603? – 664 AD), who travelled from China to India through Central Asia, mentioned the name of the city as {{transliteration|zh|Zhěshí}} ({{lang|zh|赭時}}). The Chinese chronicles ''[[History of Northern Dynasties]]'', ''[[Book of Sui]]'', and ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' mention a possession called {{transliteration|zh|Shí}} {{lang|zh|石}} ("stone") or {{transliteration|zh|Zhěshí}} {{lang|zh|赭時}} with a capital of the same name since the fifth century AD.<ref>Bichurin, 1950. v. II</ref>

In 558–603, Chach was part of the [[First Turkic Khaganate|Turkic Khaganate]]. At the beginning of the 7th century, the Turkic Kaganate, as a result of internecine wars and wars with its neighbors, disintegrated into the [[Western Turkic Khaganate|Western]] and [[Eastern Turkic Khaganate|Eastern Kaganate]]s. The Western Turkic ruler [[Tong Yabghu Qaghan]] (618-630) set up his headquarters in the Ming-bulak area to the north of Chach. Here he received embassies from the emperors of the [[Tang dynasty|Tang Empire]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]].<ref>Golden, P.B. ''An Introduction to the History of the Turkic Peoples''. Series: Turcologica. Wiesbaden: Otto-Harrassowitz. 1992</ref> In 626, the Indian Buddhist preacher [[Prabhakāramitra]] arrived with ten companions to the Khagan. In 628, Xuanzang arrived in Ming-bulak.

The Turkic rulers of Chach minted their coins with the inscription on the obverse side of the "lord of the Khakan money" (mid-8th century); with an inscription in the ruler Turk (7th century), in Nudjket in the middle of the 8th century, coins were issued with the obverse inscription “Nanchu (Banchu) Ertegin sovereign".<ref>Baratova L.

===Islamic Caliphate===
{{Further|Umayyad Caliphate|Abbasid Caliphate}}
Chach (Arabic: Shash) was [[Muslim conquest of Transoxiana|conquered]] by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] at the beginning of the 8th century.<ref>O. G. Bol'shakov. Istoriya Khalifata, t. 4: apogey i padeniye. — Moskva: «Vostochnaya literatura» RAN, 2010</ref>

According to the descriptions of the authors of the 10th century, Shash was structurally divided into a [[citadel]], an inner city (madina) and two suburbs - an inner (rabad-dahil) and an outer (rabad-harij). The citadel, surrounded by a special wall with two gates, contained the ruler's palace and the prison.<ref>[[Margarita Ivanovna Filanovich|Filanovich, M.I.]] Tashkent (zarozhdeniye i razvitiye goroda i gorodskoy kul'tury). Tashkent, 1983, p.188</ref>

===Post Caliphate rule===
{{Further|Anarchy at Samarra|Samanid Empire}}
Under the [[Samanid Empire]], whose founder [[Ismail Samani]] was a descendant of [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] convert to [[Islam]], the city came to be known as ''Binkath''. However, the Arabs retained the old name of ''Chach'' for the surrounding region, pronouncing it ''ash-Shāsh'' ({{lang|ar|الشاش}}) instead. 
Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ali ash-Shashi, known as al-Kaffal ash-Shashi (904-975), was born in Tashkent. He was an Islamic theologian, scholar, jurist of the [[Shafi'i]] ''madhhab'', hadith scholar and linguist.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

After the 11th century, the name evolved from Chachkand/Chashkand to Tashkand. The modern spelling of "Tashkent" reflects [[Russian language|Russian]] orthography and 20th-century Soviet influence.

At the end of the 10th century, Tashkent became part of the possessions of the Turkic state of the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate|Karakhanids]]. In 998/99 the Tashkent oasis went to the Karakhanid Ahmad ibn Ali, who ruled the north-eastern regions of [[Transoxiana|Mavarannahr]]. In 1177/78, a separate khanate was formed in the Tashkent oasis. Its center was Banakat, where dirhams of Mu'izz ad-dunya wa-d-din Qilich-khan were minted, in 1195–1197; and of Jalal ad-dunya wa-d-din Tafgach-khakan, in 1197–1206.<ref>Kochnev B. D., Numizmaticheskaya istoriya Karakhanidskogo kaganata (991—1209 gg.). Moskva «Sofiya», 2006, p.157,234</ref>

===Mongol conquest===
{{main|Mongol Empire|Chagatai Khanate}}
The city was destroyed by [[Genghis Khan]] in 1219 and lost much of its population as a result of the [[Mongols]]' destruction of the [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarezmid Empire]] in 1220.

===Timurid period===
{{Further|Timurid Empire}}
Under the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] and subsequent [[Shaybanid]] dynasties, the city's population and culture gradually revived as a prominent strategic center of scholarship, commerce and trade along the [[Silk Road]].
During the reign of [[Timur|Amir Timur]] (1336-1405), Tashkent was restored and in the 14th-15th centuries Tashkent was part of Timur's empire. For Timur, Tashkent was considered a strategic city. In 1391 Timur set out in the spring from Tashkent to Desht-i-Kipchak to fight the Khan of the [[Golden Horde]] [[Tokhtamysh|Tokhtamysh Khan]]. Timur returned from this victorious campaign through Tashkent.<ref>Fasikh Akhmad ibn Dzhalal ad-Din Mukhammad al-Khavafi. Fasikhov svod. Tashkent: Fan. 1980, p.114</ref>
[[File:Mausoleum Zangiata 15-12.JPG|thumb|left|Zangi ata shrine]]
The most famous saint Sufi of Tashkent was Sheikh Khovendi at-Takhur (13th to the first half of the 14th century). According to legend, Amir Timur, who was treating his wounded leg in Tashkent with the healing water of the Zem-Zem spring, ordered to build a mausoleum for the saint. By order of Timur, the Zangiata mausoleum was built.

===Uzbek Shaybanid's dynasty period===
In the 16th century, Tashkent was ruled by the [[Shaybanids|Shaybanid dynasty]].<ref>Dobromyslov A. I., Tashkent v proshlom i nastoyashchem. Tashkent, 1912, p.9</ref><ref>Istoriya Tashkenta. Tashkent: Fan, 1988, p.70</ref>
[[File:Barakhan Madrasah Tashkent.jpg|thumb|280px|Barak khan madrasa, Shaybanids, 16th century]]
Shaybanid Suyunchkhoja Khan was an enlightened Uzbek ruler; following the traditions of his ancestors Mirzo [[Ulugbek]] and [[Abul Khair Khan]], he gathered famous scientists, writers and poets at his court, among them: Vasifi, Abdullah Nasrullahi, Masud bin Osmani Kuhistani. Since 1518 Vasifi was the educator of the son of Suyunchhoja Khan Keldi Muhammad, with whom, after the death of his father in 1525, he moved to Tashkent. After the death of his former pupil, he became the educator of his son, Abu-l-Muzaffar Hasan-Sultan.<ref>Yudin V. P. Materialy po istorii kazakhskikh khanstv XV-XVIII vekov. (Izvlecheniya iz persidskikh i tyurkskikh sochineniy). — Alma-Ata : Nauka, 1969, p.174.</ref>

Later the city was subordinated to Shaybanid [[Abdullah Khan II]] (the ruler actually from 1557, officially in 1583–1598), who issued his coins here.<ref>Ye. A. Davidovich, Korpus zolotykh i serebryanykh monet Sheybanidov. XVI vek. M., 1992</ref>
From 1598 to 1604 Tashkent was ruled by the Shaybanid Keldi Muhammad, who issued silver and copper coins on his behalf.<ref>Burnasheva R. Z., Nekotoryye svedeniya o chekanke mednykh monet v Tashkente v XVI—XIX vv. Izvestiya Natsional'noy akademii nauk Kazakhstana, № 1, 2007, p.153</ref>

===Kazakh ruled period===
In 1598, Kazakh Tauekel Khan was at war with the [[Khanate of Bukhara]]. The Bukhara troops sent against him were defeated by Kazakhs in the battle between Tashkent and Samarkand. During the reign of Yesim-Khan,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331682741 |title=Yesim-Khan |website=www.researchgate.net}}</ref> a peace treaty was concluded between Bukhara and Kazakhs, according to which Kazakhs abandoned Samarkand, but left behind Tashkent, Turkestan and a number of Syr Darya cities.

Yesim-Khan ruled the [[Kazakh Khanate]] from 1598 to 1628, his main merit was that he managed to unite the Kazakh khanate.

The city was part of Kazakh Khanate between 1598 and 1723.<ref>History of Civilizations of Central Asia,Volume V, UNESCO Publishing, page 97,https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000130205/PDF/130205eng.pdf.multi</ref>

===Tashkent state===
In 1784, [[Yunus Khoja]], the ruler of the dakha (district) Shayhantahur, united the entire city under his rule and created an independent Tashkent state (1784-1807), which by the beginning of the 19th century seized vast lands.<ref>Istoriya Tashkenta (s drevneyshikh vremon do pobedy Fevral'skoy burzhuazno-demokraticheskoy revolyutsii) / Ziyayev KH. Z., Buryakov YU. V.  Tashkent: «Fan», 1988</ref>

===Kokand Khanate===
In 1809, Tashkent was annexed to the [[Khanate of Kokand]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/uzbekistan/tashkent/background/history/a/nar/83060059-d12c-48ec-8718-1d6c939451a5/357844 |title=History in Tashkent, Uzbekistan |first=Lonely |last=Planet}}</ref> At the time, Tashkent had a population of around 100,000 and was considered the richest city in Central Asia.

Under the Kokand domination, Tashkent was surrounded by a moat and an adobe battlement (about 20 kilometers long) with 12 gates.<ref>Istoriya Tashkenta (s drevneyshikh vremyon do pobedy Fevralskoy burzhuazno-demokraticheskoy revolyutsii) / Ziyayev Kh. Z., Buryakov Y.F. Tashkent: «Fan», 1988</ref>

It prospered greatly through trade with Russia but chafed under Kokand's high taxes. The Tashkent clergy also favored the clergy of [[Bukhara]] over that of Kokand. However, before the [[Emir]] of Bukhara could capitalize on this discontent, the Russian army arrived.

===Colonial period===
{{more citations needed|section|date=June 2019}}
[[File:Храм Александра Невского (Ташкент).png|thumb|Alexander Nevsky Cathedral was built by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in Tashkent.]] 
In May 1865, [[Mikhail Grigorevich Chernyayev]] (Cherniaev), acting against the direct orders of the [[Tsar]] and outnumbered at least 15–1, staged a daring night attack against a city with a wall {{cvt|25|km|mi}} long with 11 gates and 30,000 defenders. While a small contingent staged a diversionary attack, the main force penetrated the walls, led by a [[Russian Orthodox]] priest. Although the defense was stiff, the Russians captured the city after two days of heavy fighting and the loss of only 25 dead as opposed to several thousand of the defenders (including [[Alimqul]], the ruler of the Kokand Khanate). Chernyayev, dubbed the "Lion of Tashkent" by city elders, staged a hearts-and-minds campaign to win the population over. He abolished taxes for a year, rode unarmed through the streets and bazaars meeting common people, and appointed himself "Military Governor of Tashkent", recommending to [[Tsar Alexander II]] that the city become an independent [[khanate]] under Russian protection.
[[File:Taskent city coat 1909.gif|thumb|left|upright|Coats of arms of Tashkent, 1909]]
The Tsar liberally rewarded Chernyayev and his men with medals and bonuses, but regarded the impulsive general as a loose cannon, and soon replaced him with General [[Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufman]]. Far from being granted independence, Tashkent became the capital of the new territory of [[Russian Turkistan]], with Kaufman as first Governor-General. A [[cantonment]] and Russian settlement were built across the Ankhor Canal from the old city, and Russian settlers and merchants poured in. Tashkent was a center of espionage in the [[Great Game]] rivalry between Russia and the United Kingdom over Central Asia. The [[Turkestan Military District]] was established as part of the military reforms of 1874. The [[Trans-Caspian Railway]] arrived in 1889, and the railway workers who built it settled in Tashkent as well, bringing with them the seeds of [[Bolshevik Revolution]].

===Effect of the Russian Revolution===
[[File:Ташкент пассаж Ариф-Ходжи.jpg|thumb|Tashkent c. 1910]]
With the fall of the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Russian Provisional Government]] removed all civil restrictions based on religion and nationality, contributing to local enthusiasm for the [[February Revolution]]. The [[Tashkent Soviet]] of Soldiers' and Workers' Deputies was soon set up, but primarily represented Russian residents, who made up about a fifth of the Tashkent population. Muslim leaders quickly set up the Tashkent Muslim Council (''Tashkand Shura-yi-Islamiya'') based in the old city. On 10 March 1917, there was a parade with Russian workers marching with red flags, Russian soldiers singing ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' and thousands of local Central Asians. Following various speeches, Governor-General [[Aleksey Kuropatkin]] closed the events with words "Long Live a great free Russia".<ref>Jeff Sahadeo, ''Russian Colonial Society in Tashkent,'' Indiana University Press, 2007, p188</ref>

The First Turkestan Muslim Conference was held in Tashkent 16–20 April 1917. Like the Muslim Council, it was dominated by the [[Jadid]], Muslim reformers. A more conservative faction emerged in Tashkent centered around the [[Ulema]]. This faction proved more successful during the local elections of July 1917. They formed an alliance with Russian conservatives, while the Soviet became more radical. The Soviet attempt to seize power in September 1917 proved unsuccessful.<ref>Rex A. Wade, ''The Russian Revolution, 1917,'' Cambridge University Press, 2005</ref>

In April 1918, Tashkent became the capital of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic ([[Turkestan ASSR]]). The new regime was threatened by White forces, ''[[basmachi]];'' revolts from within, and purges ordered from Moscow.

===Soviet period===

The city began to industrialize in the 1920s and 1930s.

Violating the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. The government worked to relocate factories from western Russia and Ukraine to Tashkent to preserve the Soviet industrial capacity. This led to great increase in industry during World War II.

It also evacuated most of the German communist emigres to Tashkent.<ref name="shirer">[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/modlanggerman/3/ Robert K. Shirer, "Johannes R. Becher 1891–1958"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160907164118/http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/modlanggerman/3/ |date=7 September 2016 }}, ''Encyclopedia of German Literature'', Chicago and London: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, 2000, by permission at Digital Commons, University of Nebraska, accessed 3 February 2013</ref> The Russian population increased dramatically; evacuees from the war zones increased the total population of Tashkent to well over a million.

During the postwar period, the [[Soviet Union]] established numerous scientific and engineering facilities in Tashkent.

On 10 January 1966, then [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] and [[President of Pakistan|Pakistan President]] [[Ayub Khan (general)|Ayub Khan]] signed a [[Tashkent Declaration|pact in Tashkent]] with [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] [[Alexei Kosygin]] as the mediator to resolve the terms of peace after the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]]. On the next day, Shastri died suddenly, reportedly due to a heart attack. It is widely speculated that Shastri was killed by poisoning the water he drank.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Much of Tashkent's old city was destroyed by a powerful [[1966 Tashkent earthquake|earthquake on 26 April 1966]]. More than 300,000 residents were left homeless, and some 78,000 [[Earthquake engineering|poorly engineered]] homes were destroyed,<ref name="tga">{{cite book |last=Sadikov |first=A C |author2=Akramob Z.

Tashkent was rebuilt as a model Soviet city with wide streets planted with shade trees, parks, immense plazas for parades, fountains, monuments, and acres of apartment blocks. The [[Tashkent Metro]] was also built during this time. About 100,000 new homes were built by 1970,<ref name="tga" /> but the builders occupied many, rather than the homeless residents of Tashkent.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} Further development in the following years increased the size of the city with major new developments in the Chilonzor area, north-east and south-east of the city.<ref name="tga" />

At the time of the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, Tashkent was the fourth-largest city in the USSR and a center of learning in the fields of science and engineering.

Due to the [[1966 Tashkent earthquake|1966 earthquake]] and the Soviet redevelopment, little architectural heritage has survived of Tashkent's ancient history. Few structures mark its significance as a trading point on the historic [[Silk Road]].

Such countries of the Soviet Union as [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Armenia]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Belarus]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Tajikistan]], [[Latvia]], [[Moldova]], [[Estonia]] helped restore the city after the earthquake and erected many modern buildings.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Сидорчик |first=Андрей |date=2021-04-26 |title=Сила миллионов сердец.

===Capital of Uzbekistan===
Tashkent is the capital of Uzbekistan, noted for its tree-lined streets, fountains and parks. In 2009, the local government initiated a controversial tree-cutting campaign.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://enews.fergananews.com/article.php?id=2590 |title=Good bye the Tashkent Public Garden! |publisher=Ferghana.Ru |date=23 November 2009 |access-date=30 September 2012 |archive-date=11 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611092449/http://enews.fergananews.com/article.php?id=2590 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Since 1991, the city has changed economically, culturally, and architecturally. New development has superseded or replaced icons of the Soviet era. The largest statue ever erected for Lenin was replaced with a globe, featuring a geographic map of Uzbekistan. Buildings from the Soviet era have been replaced with new modern buildings. The "Downtown Tashkent" district includes the 22-story [[National Bank of Uzbekistan|NBU Bank]] building, international hotels, the International Business Center, and the Plaza Building.

The Tashkent Business district is a special district, established for the development of small, medium and large businesses in Uzbekistan. In 2018, construction began on a new Downtown which would include a business district with skyscrapers of local and foreign companies, world hotels such as [[Hilton Hotels & Resorts|Hilton Tashkent Hotel]], apartments, malls, shops and other entertainment.

===The invention of television===
In the summer of 1928, the first fully electronic TV set was presented to the public in Tashkent. [[Boris Grabovsky]]'s method, patented in [[Saratov]] in 1925, proposed a new model of TV imaging based on the vertical and horizontal electron beam sweeping under high voltage. Nowadays this principle of the TV imaging is used practically in all modern cathode-ray tubes. Historian and ethnographer Boris Golender (Борис Голендер in Russian), in a video lecture, described this event.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fergananews.com/articles/8089 |title=Видеолекторий "Ферганы": Изобретение телевидения и Борис Грабовский |website=Фергана.Ру}}</ref> This date of demonstration of the fully electronic TV set is the earliest known so far. Despite this fact, most modern historians disputably consider [[Vladimir Zworykin]] and [[Philo Farnsworth]]<ref>K. Krull, The boy who invented TV: The story of Philo Farnsworth, 2014</ref> as inventors of the first fully electronic TV set. In 1964, the contribution made to the development of early television by Grabovsky was officially acknowledged by the Uzbek government and he was awarded the prestigious degree "Honorable Inventor of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic".

==Geography==
Tashkent is situated in a well-watered plain on the road between [[Samarkand]], Uzbekistan's second city, and [[Shymkent]] across the [[Kazakhstan–Uzbekistan border|border]]. Tashkent is just 13&nbsp;km from two border crossings into [[Kazakhstan]].

Closest geographic cities with populations of over 1 million are: [[Shymkent]] (Kazakhstan), [[Dushanbe]] (Tajikistan), [[Bishkek]] (Kyrgyzstan), [[Kashgar]] (China), [[Almaty]] (Kazakhstan), [[Kabul]] (Afghanistan) and [[Peshawar]] (Pakistan).

Tashkent sits at the confluence of the [[Chirchiq River]] and several of its tributaries and is built on deep alluvial deposits up to {{cvt|15|m}}. The city is located in an active tectonic area suffering large numbers of tremors and some earthquakes.

The local time in Tashkent is [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC/GMT]] +5 hours.

Tashkent features a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa'') with some [[humid continental climate]] influences ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dsa'').<ref name="Koeppen">[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Asia_K%C3%B6ppen_Map.png Updated Asian map of the Köppen climate classification system]</ref> As a result, Tashkent experiences cold and often snowy winters not typically associated with most Mediterranean climates and long, hot and dry summers. Most [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] occurs during the winter, which frequently falls as snow. The city experiences two peaks of precipitation in the early winter and spring. The slightly unusual precipitation pattern is partially due to its {{cvt|500|m|ft}} altitude. Summers are long in Tashkent, usually lasting from May to September. Tashkent can be extremely hot during the months of July and August. The city also sees very little precipitation during the summer, particularly from June through September.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tashkent-travel.com/weather |title=Tashkent weather forecast |access-date=11 June 2009 |author=Tashkent Travel |location=Tashkent, Uzbekistan |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529214452/http://www.tashkent-travel.com/weather |archive-date=29 May 2009 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.happytellus.com/tashkent/uzbekistan |title=Tashkent, Uzbekistan travel information |access-date=11 June 2009 |author=Happy-Tellus.com |publisher=Infocenter International Ltd. |location=Helsinki, Finland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627124528/http://www.happytellus.com/tashkent/uzbekistan |archive-date=27 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Before Tashkent was conquered by the Russian Empire, it was divided into four districts, or ''daha'' in Uzbek:

#Beshyoghoch
#Kukcha
#Shaykhontokhur
#Sebzor

In 1940 it had the following districts (Russian ''район''):

#[[October Revolution|Oktyabr]]
#[[Sergey Kirov|Kirov]]
#[[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]
#[[Mikhail Frunze|Frunze]]
#[[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]
#[[Valerian Kuybyshev|Kuybishev]]

By 1981, these were reorganized into the following:<ref name="tga"/>

#Bektemir
#Akmal-Ikramov (Uchtepa)
#Khamza (Yashnobod)
#Lenin (Mirobod)
#Kuybishev (Mirzo Ulugbek)
#Sergeli
#Oktober (Shaykhontokhur)
#Sobir Rakhimov (Olmazar)
#Chilanzar
#Frunze (Yakkasaray)
#Kirov (Yunusabad)

Due to the destruction of most of the ancient city during the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|1917 revolution]] and, later, the 1966 earthquake, little remains of Tashkent's traditional architectural heritage. Tashkent is, however, rich in museums and Soviet-era monuments. They include:

*[[Kukeldash Madrasah (Tashkent)|Kukeldash Madrasah]]. Dating back to the reign of [[Abdullah Khan II]] (1557–1598) it is being restored by the provincial Religious Board of [[Mawarannahr]] Moslems. There is talk of making it into a museum, but it is currently being used as a madrassah.
*[[Chorsu Bazaar]], located near the Kukeldash Madrassa. This huge open air [[bazaar]] is the center of the old town of Tashkent. Everything imaginable is for sale. It is one of the major tourist attractions of the city.
*Hazrati Imam Complex. It includes several mosques, shrine, and a library which contains a [[Uthman Qur'an|manuscript Qur'an in Kufic script]], considered to be the oldest extant [[Qur'an]] in the world. Dating from 655 and stained with the blood of murdered caliph, [[Uthman]], it was brought by Timur to [[Samarkand]], seized by the Russians as a war trophy, and taken to [[Saint Petersburg]]. It was returned to Uzbekistan in 1924.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4581684.stm |title=Tashkent's hidden Islamic relic |author=MacWilliams, Ian |date=5 January 2006 |work=BBC News |access-date=8 June 2010}}</ref>
*[[Qaffol Shoshi mausoleum]] built in honor of Imam Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Ismail al-Kaffal ash-Shashi.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://legacy.uz/znakomstvo-s-mavzoleem-al-kaffal-ash-shashi/|title= "KAFFAL ASH-SHOSHI MAQBARASI"|website= legacy.uz |accessdate= 2023-12-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url= https://uzbekistan.travel/uz/o/toshkentning-asosiy-ziyorat-obyektlari-boylab-sayyohlik-marshruti/ |title= Toshkentning asosiy ziyorat obyektlari bo'ylab sayyohlik marshruti |website= uzbekistan.travel |accessdate= 2023-12-11}}</ref> The original tomb did not survive in its initial form. In its current state, the mausoleum was constructed in 1542 by the royal architect of that time, Gulyam Husayn. It is an asymmetrical domed portal mausoleum, known as a khanqah.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.centralasia-travel.com/ru/countries/uzbekistan/places/tashkent/kaffal-shashi |title= МА МАВЗОЛЕЙ АБУБЕКРА КАФФАЛЯ АШ-ШАШИ |website= www.centralasia-travel.com |accessdate= 2023-12-11}}</ref>
*Yunus Khan Mausoleum. It is a group of three 15th-century [[mausoleums]], restored in the 19th century. The biggest is the grave of [[Yunus Khan]], grandfather of [[Mughal Empire]] founder [[Babur]].
*[[Romanov Palace|Palace of Prince Romanov]]. During the 19th century [[Grand Duke]] [[Nikolai Konstantinovich]], a first cousin of [[Alexander III of Russia]] was banished to Tashkent for some shady deals involving the Russian Crown Jewels. His palace still survives in the center of the city. Once a museum, it has been appropriated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
*[[Navoi Theater|Alisher Navoi Opera and Ballet Theatre]], built by the same architect who designed [[Lenin's Tomb]] in Moscow, [[Aleksey Shchusev]], with [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[prisoner of war]] labor in World War II. It hosts Russian ballet and opera.
*Fine Arts Museum of Uzbekistan. It contains a major collection of art from the pre-Russian period, including [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] murals, [[Buddhist]] statues, and [[Zoroastrian]] art, along with a more modern collection of 19th and 20th century [[applied art]], such as [[suzani textile|suzani]] embroidered hangings. Of more interest is the large collection of paintings "borrowed" from the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]] by Grand Duke Romanov to decorate his palace in exile in Tashkent, and never returned. Behind the museum is a small park, containing the neglected graves of the [[Bolsheviks]] who died in the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and to [[K. P. Osipov|Osipov]]'s treachery in 1919,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwquCgAAQBAJ&q=osipov+tashkent&pg=PA58 |title=Historical Dictionary of the Russian Civil Wars, 1916–1926 |first=Jonathan D. |last=Smele |page=58 |date=20 November 2015 |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]] |isbn=978-1442252806 |access-date=16 May 2016}}</ref> along with first Uzbekistani President [[Yuldosh Akhunbabayev]].
*Museum of Applied Arts. Housed in a traditional house originally commissioned for a wealthy tsarist diplomat, the house itself is the main attraction, rather than its collection of 19th and 20th century [[applied arts]].
*[[State Museum of History of Uzbekistan]] the largest museum in the city. It is housed in the ex-Lenin Museum.
*[[Amir Timur Museum]], housed in a building with a brilliant blue dome and ornate interior. It houses exhibits of [[Timur]] and of President [[Islam Karimov]]. To adjacent south of the museum is [[Amir Timur Square]] where there is a statue of Timur on horseback, surrounded by some of the nicest gardens and fountains in the city.
*Navoi Literary Museum, commemorating Uzbekistan's adopted literary hero, [[Alisher Navoi]], with replica manuscripts, [[Islamic calligraphy]] and 15th century [[Portrait miniature|miniature paintings]].
*The [[Tashkent Metro]] is known for extravagant design and architecture in the buildings. Taking photos in the system was banned until 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destinations/asia/uzbekistan/pictures-tashkent-metro-underground/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002222900/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destinations/asia/uzbekistan/pictures-tashkent-metro-underground/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 October 2018 |title=Inside Uzbekistan's beautiful, rarely-seen metro |date=2 October 2018 |work=National Geographic}}</ref>

The Russian Orthodox church in Amir Temur Square, built in 1898, was demolished in 2009. The building had not been allowed to be used for religious purposes since the 1920s due to the anti-religious campaign conducted across the former Soviet Union by the Bolshevik (communist) government in Moscow. During the Soviet period, the building was used for different non-religious purposes; after independence, it was a bank.

Tashkent also has a World War II memorial park and a Defender of Motherland monument.<ref>uznews.net, [http://www.uznews.net/news_single.php?lng=en&sub=&cid=8&nid=12165 Tashkent's central park is history] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724134738/http://www.uznews.net/news_single.php?lng=en&sub=&cid=8&nid=12165 |date=24 July 2011 }}, 25 November 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.uznews.net/news_single.php?lng=en&sub=&cid=8&nid=12165 Army memorial dismantled in Tashkent] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724134738/http://www.uznews.net/news_single.php?lng=en&sub=&cid=8&nid=12165 |date=24 July 2011 }}, 24 November 2009</ref><ref>Ferghana.ru, [http://www.ferghana.ru/news.php?id=13819&mode=snews МИД России указал послу Узбекистана на обеспокоенность «Наших»] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125040704/http://www.ferghana.ru/news.php?id=13819 |date=25 January 2010 }}, 16 January 2010 {{in lang|ru}}</ref>
