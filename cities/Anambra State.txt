During the [[Nigerian Civil War]] (1967–1970), Anambra State was part of the secessionist [[Biafra|Republic of Biafra]] formed by Igbo nationalists. Anambra was severely affected by the war.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2020-01-15|title=Remembering Nigeria's Biafra war that many prefer to forget|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-51094093|access-date=2021-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Derrick|first=Jonathan|date=1984|title=West Africa's Worst Year of Famine|journal=African Affairs|volume=83|issue=332|pages=281–299|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a097620|jstor=722349|issn=0001-9909}}</ref> Today, Anambra State is one of the most [[Urbanization|urbanized]] states in Nigeria.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Anambra State Government – Light Of The Nation|url=https://old.anambrastate.gov.ng/urbanization-and-regional-planning|access-date=2021-03-09|website=old.anambrastate.gov.ng|archive-date=18 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211118150649/https://old.anambrastate.gov.ng/urbanization-and-regional-planning|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Nigeria: poverty rate, by state 2019|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/1121438/poverty-headcount-rate-in-nigeria-by-state/|access-date=2021-03-09|website=Statista|language=en}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name Anambra is the merging of [[Anam, Nigeria|Anam]] and the English word 'branch'. Anam is a clan in the [[Omambala River|Omambala]] region<ref>{{Cite web |last=eribake |first=akintayo |date=2014-09-20 |title=Controversy over Igbo Origin: 'We have proof that Umueri is the cradle of Ndigbo' |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/09/controversy-igbo-origin-proof-umueri-cradle-ndigbo/ |access-date=2022-08-30 |website=Vanguard News |language=en-GB}}</ref> and the last Igbo speaking community the British colonialists encountered while heading up to Northern Nigeria from across the riverine areas. They usually described present day Anambra as 'Anam branch' to their colleagues up North. Reason Anam together with some neighboring clans was Anambra LGA when the state was created. It is now Anambra-West LGA with Olumbanasa.

== History ==
Anambra's history stretches to the 9th century AD, as revealed by archaeological excavations at [[Archaeology of Igbo-Ukwu|Igbo-Ukwu]] and [[Ezira]]. It has great works of art in [[iron]], [[bronze]], [[copper]], and [[pottery]]. These have revealed a sophisticated divine Kingship administrative system, which held sway in the area of Anambra from c. 948 AD to 1911. In some towns, such as [[Ogidi, Anambra State|Ogidi]] and others, local families had hereditary rights to kingship for centuries.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Onumonu |first=Ugo Pascal |title=The development of kingship institution in Oru-Igbo up to 1991 |date=2016 |url=https://www.ajol.info/index.php/og/article/download/141242/130976 |journal=Ogirisi: A New Journal of African Studies |volume=12 |pages=68–96|doi=10.4314/og.v12i1.4 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Okonkwo |first=Nwabueze |date=24 May 2017 |title=Appeal court ends 233-year old rule by Amobi family of Ogidi |work=Vanguard |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/05/appeal-court-ends-233-year-old-rule-amobi-family-ogidi/ |access-date=26 June 2022}}</ref>

Great Britain recognised some of these traditional kings and leaders in their system of indirect rule of the Protectorate of South [[Nigeria]]. Beginning in the 19th century, they appointed some noble leaders as Warrant Chiefs, authorizing them to collect taxes, among other duties.

Anambra is in the Igbo-dominated area that seceded as part of an independent [[Biafra]] in 1967, following rising tensions with Northern Nigeria. During the [[Nigerian Civil War|Nigerian/Biafran]] war (1967–1970), [[Biafra]]n engineers constructed a relief airstrip in the town of Uli/Amorka (code named "Annabelle"). Extremely dangerous relief flights took off from [[Sao Tome]] and other sites loaded with tons of food and medicine for the distressed Biafran population. Uli/Amorka airstrip was the site where American pilots such as Alex Nicoll, and scores of others, delivered tons of relief supplies to the Biafran population.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://ajcarchives.net/AJC_DATA/Files/661.PDF| title = Reference at ajcarchives.net| access-date = 8 January 2009| archive-date = 23 July 2011| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110723005150/http://ajcarchives.net/AJC_DATA/Files/661.PDF}}</ref>

Disgusted by the suffering and mounting death toll in [[Biafra]] from starvation, as well as the continuous harassment of the relief planes by the [[Nigerian Air Force|Nigerian Airforce]], [[Carl Gustaf von Rosen]] resigned as a [[Red Cross]] relief pilot. He helped Biafra to form an Airforce of five Minicoin planes [[Malmö MFI-9]] stationed at the Uga airstrip. He named his tiny but effective air force "[[Biafran airlift|Babies of Biafra]]" in honour of the babies who died from starvation inside Biafra.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Dr. Marshall |first=Michel |date=4 April 2008 |title=The Biafran Babies |work=Kaiserslautern American |url=https://www.kaiserslauternamerican.com/the-biafran-babies/ |access-date=26 June 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.las-en-bok.com/biafran_babies_eng.pdf |title=Operation Biafran Babies |publisher=www.las-en-bok.com |date=2014 |pages=1–185 |language=English}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Lasse |first=Heerten |date=15 September 2017 |title="Biafran Babies" |pages=140–174 |doi=10.1017/9781316282243.006 |isbn=978-1-316-28224-3 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/biafran-war-and-postcolonial-humanitarianism/biafran-babies/F6DE9FF424C7D983C8DC3F2581D32702 |access-date=26 June 2022}}</ref>

Old Anambra State was created in 1976 from part of [[East Central State]], and its capital was [[Enugu]]. In 1991, a re-organisation divided Anambra into two states, Anambra and [[Enugu State, Nigeria|Enugu]]. The capital of the New Anambra is [[Awka]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Anambra {{!}} state, Nigeria|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Anambra|access-date=2021-06-14|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>

Anambra is the eighth-most populated state in the [[Federal Republic of Nigeria]] and the second-most densely populated state in [[Nigeria]] after [[Lagos State]]. The stretch of more than 45&nbsp;km between the towns of [[Oba, Anambra|Oba]] and [[Amorka]] contains a cluster of numerous thickly populated villages and small towns, giving the area an estimated average density of 1,500–2,000 persons per square kilometre.<ref>{{Cite web|title=[Shapefile] Anambra State|url=https://www.gamers.com.ng/shapefile-anambra-state/|last=gamers|date=2019-08-22|website=Geospatial Analysis Mapping and Environmental Research Solutions|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref>

The state has a Tropical wet and dry or [[Savanna|savanna climate]] with yearly temperature of 28.99&nbsp;°C (84.18&nbsp;°F) and it is -0.47% lower than Nigeria's averages. Anambra typically receives about 212.36 millimeters (8.36 inches) of precipitation and has 243.38 rainy days (66.68% of the time) annually.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Anambra, NG Climate Zone, Monthly Weather Averages and Historical Data |url=https://tcktcktck.org/nigeria/anambra#:~:text=Anambra%20Climate%20Summary,climate%20(Classification:%20Aw). |access-date=2023-06-30 |website=tcktcktck.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Climate Anambra: Temperature, climate graph, Climate table for Anambra - Climate-Data.org |url=https://en.climate-data.org/africa/nigeria/anambra-344/ |access-date=2023-06-30 |website=en.climate-data.org}}</ref>

The state has been described as one of the worst places affected by the [[climate change]] in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa in 2022 according to the Climate Change Education and Action Programme, (CLEAP).<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-08-04 |title=Anambra among worst hit by climate change in Nigeria, Sub-Saharan Africa – CLEAP |url=https://dailytrust.com/anambra-among-worst-hit-by-climate-change-in-nigeria-sub-saharan-africa-cleap/ |access-date=2023-06-30 |website=Daily Trust |language=en-GB}}</ref>

With an annual population growth rate of 2.21 percent per annum, Anambra State has over 60% of its people living in urban areas. It is one of the most urbanized states in Nigeria.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nigeria: Onitsha Urban Profile {{!}} UN-Habitat |url=https://unhabitat.org/nigeria-onitsha-urban-profile |access-date=2023-10-22 |website=unhabitat.org}}</ref>

The major urban centres of Anambra State are [[Onitsha]], Nnewi, [[Ekwulobia]], Ihiala, [[Aguleri]] and [[Awka]], the state capital. Awka and Onitsha had developed as pre-colonial urban centres: Awka was the craft industrial centre of the Nri hegemony. Onitsha is a city state on the Niger, having developed as a river port and commercial centre.

Onitsha is a fast-growing commercial city and has developed to become a huge conurbation extending to [[Idemili North|Idemili]], Oyi and Anambra East LGAs, with one of the largest markets in West Africa.

In 2012 the tri-city area was dubbed the Onitsha-Nnewi-Awka (ONA) Industrial Axis, in recognition of the expanding industrial capacity.

Agriculture is an important economic sector in Anambra. [[Elaeis guineensis|Oil palms]], [[maize]], [[rice]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]] and [[cassava]] are among the crops grown. [[Fishing]] is also part of the economic mainstay of Anambra State more especially for communities along the riverine areas.

Anambra is a home of innovation, inventions and creativity. There have been several innovations in Anambra, due to its appreciation of education, which has added to the state's GDP. One of those was in 2018, when two brothers, Atikpo Chukwuebuka and Ubaka Chukwuebuka, were the first to invent a machine, that could wash off the bitterness from bitter-leaf (a popular vegetable staple in Nigeria).<ref name="techecon bitter">{{Cite web|title=Two brothers invent bitterleaf washing machine; underscore relevance to economy|url=https://techeconomy.ng/2018/08/two-brothers-invent-bitterleaf-washing-machine-underscore-relevance-to-economy/amp/}}{{Dead link|date=August 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> This machine will greatly improve the productivity of vegetable farming in the state.

The [[export]] of agricultural items is a continual boost to Anambra Internal Generated Revenue. In 2017, the state generated $5 million from the export of washed bitter leaf.<ref name="techecon bitter" />

There is a huge deposit of oil and gas in Nigeria, with the [[Anambra Basin]] having a great potential of 1000 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves untapped. Having more than 13 oil wells situated in Anambra, the state has the capacity to produce more than 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day, with indigenous companies like Orient Petroleum, and Sterling Oil Exploration and Production Co. LTD (SEEPCO), already leading the way.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Anambra to start earning 13% oil derivation from March, state's rice production up by 524%|date=20 February 2022 |url=https://nairametrics.com/2022/02/20/anambra-to-start-earning-13-oil-derivation-from-march-states-rice-production-up-by-524/}}</ref>

=== Natural resources ===

Anambra state has many other resources in terms of agro-based activities such as fisheries and farming, as well as land cultivated for [[pasturing]] and [[animal husbandry]].

==== Oil and gas ====
In the year 2006, a foundation-laying ceremony for the first Nigerian private refinery, [[Orient Petroleum Refinery]] (OPR), was made at [[Aguleri]] area.<ref name=":1">{{cite web |title=Reference at allafrica.com |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200604210438.html}}, All Africa, 2006</ref> The Orient Petroleum Resource Ltd (OPRL), owner of OPR, was licensed in June 2002, by the Federal Government to construct a private refinery with a capacity of {{bbl to t|55000|per=d}}.

In 2012, following the efforts of Governor [[Peter Obi]] and other stakeholders of Orient Petroleum, Anambra State became an oil-producing state. The indigenous company struck oil in the [[Anambra River]] basin.<ref name=":2">{{cite web |author=vanguardngr.com, Nigeria |date=24 March 2012 |title=Excitement as Orient Petroleum strikes oil in Anambra |url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/03/excitement-as-orient-petroleum-strikes-oil-in-anambra/ |access-date=3 December 2015 |publisher=vanguardngr.com}}</ref>

On 2 August 2015, the management of Orient Petroleum Resources Plc said the company planned to increase its crude oil production to 3,000 barrels per day by September 2015, as it stepped up production activities in two new oil wells in its [[Aguleri]] oil fields. An indigenous company, Nails and Stanley Ltd, was to establish a [[Gasplant|gas plant]] at Umueje in [[Ayamelum]] Local Government Area to support economic activities in the oil and gas industry in the state.<ref name=":3">{{cite web |author=Thisday Live, Nigeria |date=3 August 2015 |title=Anambra Refinery Targets 3,000 Barrels of Oil Per Day |url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/anambra-refinery-targets-3-000-barrels-of-oil-per-day/216474/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926214030/http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/anambra-refinery-targets-3-000-barrels-of-oil-per-day/216474/ |archive-date=26 September 2015 |access-date=3 December 2015 |publisher=thisdaylive.com}}</ref>

== Infrastructure and urbanization ==
[[File:Onitsha Bridge 2.jpg|thumb|right| Niger Bridge]]

Since the late 1990s, there has been a migration from rural to urban areas in the state, resulting in Anambra becoming a highly urbanized state: 62% of its population lives in urban areas. In October 2015, the [[All Progressives Grand Alliance|APGA]]-led state government of [[Willie Obiano]], signed a memorandum of understanding with [[Galway]] modular housing company, Affordable Building Concepts International, for 10,000 housing units to be built in the state.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/construction/affordable-building-concepts-international-to-build-houses-in-nigeria-1.2410557|title=Affordable Building Concepts International to build houses in Nigeria|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=30 October 2015 |access-date=4 December 2015}}</ref>

Given decades of neglect of infrastructure and bad governance, the shift in human migration has posed problems for the state. Infrastructure improvements, both physical and social, have lagged behind the growth in population. There are problems in environmental sanitation, erosion control, and provision of social services. Major cities have become characterized by inadequate and deteriorated road networks and walkways, unregulated building patterns, poor sanitation, uncontrolled street trading, mountains of garbage, and chaotic transport systems, creating congestion, noise pollution, and overcrowding.<ref>{{Cite SSRN |last=Nweke|first=Anselem|date=2019-10-03|title=Rural-Urban Migration in Nigeria, Implication on the Development of the Society: Anambra State as the Focus of the Study |language=en|ssrn=3463832}}</ref>

The government of Peter Obi, with the assistance of the [[United Nations Human Settlements Programme|UN-HABITAT]], produced 20-year structural plans (2009–2028) for three major cities in the State: [[Onitsha]], [[Nnewi]] and [[Awka]] – the Capital Territory, to restore urban planning and guide their growth into the future.

The plans contain policies and proposals for land use, city beautification, road infrastructure, industrial development, housing, waste disposal, water supply and health and educational facilities to turn the cities into successful urban areas that can generate employment and wealth, and provide high living standards for their residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?cid=7109&catid=223&typeid=13&subMenuId=0 |title=. Nigeria {{pipe}} Activities {{pipe}} Structure Plans for Three Urban Areas in Anambra State |publisher=Un-Habitat. |date=13 August 2013 |access-date=25 August 2013}}</ref>

Anambra became the first state in Nigeria to adopt structural plans for its cities.<ref name="Britanica1" /> With effective implementation, it should systematically grow as a major economic center in Nigeria, and West Africa.

The process of [[urbanization]] is fairly contributed by population growth, immigration, migration, and infrastructure initiatives like good road, water, power, and gardens, resulting in the growth of villages into towns, town into cities and cities into metros. To have ecologically feasible development, planning requires an understanding of the growth dynamics. There is a fear that if too many people leave the villages, only the aged men and women will be left to farm. This pattern has been seen in Amesi, Akpo, and Achina towns in Aguata local government area. They have been important in the production of yam, cocoyam, and cassava through consistent agriculture, but such activities have suffered due to the out-migration of youth to the urban centres. There has been both food scarcity in the region and over-population in [[urban area]]s.

To upgrade the state capital and improve traffic, [[Awka]], Governor [[Willie Obiano]] signed off on construction of three flyovers between the [[Amawbia]] and Arroma end of the Enugu-Onitsha Expressway, a distance of about three kilometres within the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sunnewsonline.com/new/edo-assembly-crisis-house-adjourns-sitting-2-different-dates/ |title=Anambra Today: Obiano builds 3-Arms Zone, begins moves to relocate Govt House |publisher=The Sun, Nigeria |date=26 June 2014 |access-date=3 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208045626/http://sunnewsonline.com/new/edo-assembly-crisis-house-adjourns-sitting-2-different-dates/ |archive-date=8 December 2015 }}</ref> [[Anambra International Cargo Airport]], [[Umuleri|Umueri]], opened on 7 December 2021.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2021/09/anambra-airport-to-begin-commercial-flights-in-november/amp/|title=Anambra Airport to begin commercial flights in November |date=17 September 2021 }}</ref>

== Government and politics ==

The State has a three-tier administrative structure: State, Local and Autonomous community levels. The three arms at state level are the [[Executive functions|Executive]], the [[Legislature|Legislative]] and the [[Judiciary]]. The executive arm is headed by an elected governor, who is assisted by a deputy governor, commissioners and executive advisers.

Anambra's political history can be described as varied. Until the early 21st century, it was marked by considerable unrest. Having a long list of "firsts" in Nigerian history, it has been known by the sobriquet as, "The Light of The Nation". On 29 May 1999, [[Chinwoke Mbadinuju]] was sworn in as civilian governor of Anambra state, after many years of military rule. His administration was plagued by deep problems: the most notable was withholding of teachers' salaries in the school. The teachers finally conducted a ten-month strike in all the government secondary schools in the state.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Anambra State Government – Light Of The Nation|url=https://www.anambrastate.gov.ng/politics|website=www.anambrastate.gov.ng|access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref>

Before Mbadinuju's rule, secondary education had been free of charge. His administration imposed a tuition fee of 3,000 [[Nigerian naira|Naira]] per term, for all secondary schools, which led to an unprecedented massive demonstration by secondary school students from all over the state. Many people attribute Mbadinuju's failure to political godfathers; his successor also struggled. On 26 May 2003, [[Chris Ngige]] was sworn in as the new governor of the state, but he was removed in March 2006 after Peter Obi of APGA filed charges against him of electoral malpractice. The Court of Appeal in Enugu asserted that Ngige's apparent victory in the 2003 election was fraudulent and ordered him to leave the seat.<ref name="gua">{{cite web|url=http://odili.net/news/source/2006/mar/16/18.html |title=Ngige out, Obi in as Anambra gov |access-date=10 February 2007 |work=Guardiannewsngr.com |publisher=The Guardian (Lagos) |date= 16 March 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024023154/http://odili.net/news/source/2006/mar/16/18.html |archive-date=24 October 2007 }}</ref>

On 14 April 2007, [[Andy Uba]] of PDP was "elected" as the new governor of the state and, on 29 May, was sworn in.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=2019-04-01 |title=Correction to Add Description of and Citation to Related Articles and Complete Description of Study Methods |journal=JAMA Surgery |volume=154 |issue=4 |pages=368 |doi=10.1001/jamasurg.2018.5861 |pmid=30725079 |pmc=8177334 |issn=2168-6254}}</ref> Reported to be massively rigged, the election was widely criticised. On 14 June 2007 the [[Supreme Court of Nigeria]] ruled that Peter Obi's tenure had not ended; therefore, there was no vacancy in the governorship. It removed Andy Uba from office and replaced him with his predecessor Obi.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL14239133.html |title=Reuters.com {{pipe}} Africa |work=Reuters |date=9 February 2009 |access-date=25 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221064311/http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL14239133.html |archive-date=2007-12-21 }}</ref>

On 6 February 2010, Peter Obi was re-elected governor for a second term of four years, after a hot contest with [[Chris Ngige]], a former governor of the state; Prof. [[Charles Soludo]], a former governor of the [[Central Bank of Nigeria]]; and [[Andy Uba]], who was a strong voice in the state's politics.<ref>{{Cite news |author=Dayo Benson |author2=Tony Edike |author3=Vincent Ujumadu |author4=James Ezema |date=7 February 2010 |title=INEC declares Obi winner |work=Vanguard |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2010/02/inec-declares-obi-winner/ |access-date=26 June 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=MORDI |first=RAYMOND |date=31 October 2016 |title=Obiano faces tough re-election bid |work=The Nation |url=https://thenationonlineng.net/obiano-faces-tough-re-election-bid/ |access-date=26 June 2022}}</ref> Other contenders included Mrs [[Uche Ekwunife]], Prince Nicholas Ukachukwu, and many others.

If no candidate passes threshold, a second round will be held between the top candidate and the next candidate to have received a plurality of votes in the highest number of local government areas.<ref>[https://leadership.ng/2023-next-president-govs-must-get-two-thirds-spread-says-inec/ Next President, Govs must get two thirds spread says INEC.
