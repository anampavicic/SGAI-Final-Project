== Geography ==
Benoni is situated towards the centre of the [[East Rand]] and lies on the [[Urban Fringe|urban fringe]] where the urban area dissolves into the smallholdings and farmland to the north. It borders on [[Kempton Park, South Africa|Kempton Park]] to the north-west, [[Boksburg]] to the west, [[Brakpan]] to the south and [[Daveyton]] to the east. 

Benoni mainly encompasses a mixture of suburban areas and semi-rural acreage towards the north while the commercial [[central business district]] lies in the centre and a few industrial areas lie towards the south.
