==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
Dom Francisco de Sousa, general governor of [[Brazil]] (1591 to 1602), believing in the existence of gold in the region, settled the Pelourinho —a Portuguese translation of the English "[[pillory]]", symbol of the Royal power, as the village Nova Vila de Nossa Senhora da Ponte de Mont Serrat. When gold wasn't found there, the governor returned to the Royal Court. Twelve years later, Dom Francisco de Sousa changed the name of the village to Itavuvu.

[[Baltasar Fernandes]], a member of an expeditionary group called Bandeirantes, laid the foundation of Sorocaba in the 1654. The chapel of Nossa Senhora da Ponte (which is now the Cathedral located in Fernando Prestes square, downtown) was built by him, along with the São Bento de Parnaíba monastery (now São Bento monastery) years later. It was also Fernandes who brought the first [[Benedictine]] monks to teach, assist the poor and the ill, and convert the Native Americans of the region. The monastery was donated to the Benedictines in the year 1660, after which Friar Anselmo da Anunciação and Friar Mauro were chosen to take office. The first streets and houses started to spread around the neighborhood.

In the year of 1661, Baltasar Fernandes went to São Paulo to request that Sorocaba be named a village from the governor, Correia de Sá e Benevides. Thus, on March 3, 1661, Sorocaba became known as Vila de Nossa Senhora da Ponte de Sorocaba. The organization of the Municipal Council followed shortly, with the main nominees being: Baltasar Fernandes and André de Zunega (judges), Cláudio Furquim and Pascoal Leite Pais (city councillors), Domingos Garcia (procurator) and Francisco Sanches (clerk).

With the arrival of colonel Cristóvão Pereira de Abreu and his troops in 1773, begins the main chapter of the history of Sorocaba: the [[Tropeirismo]].

The transportation of goods on the back of mules, that traversed the North-South route of the country came across Sorocaba, which was strategically placed in the main route between [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]. Soon Sorocaba had its own Feira de Muares (mule/horse fair), where troops from all states came to feed and rest their cavalry on the way to the mineral and forest expeditions, and buy and sell goods, horses and enslaved Africans. Given the growing number of people working in the city, the commerce and the first industries began to appear. Goods bought in Sorocaba were known from across the Country, spread by the merchant troops. The main events of Tropeirismo comprehended a hundred years of the Sorocaba history, from 1770 to 1870. The Tropeirismo is also responsible for spreading a locally manufactured type of Knife that became known in Brazil is as the [[Sorocaban Knife]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gazinhato|first=Laércio|title=Facas brasileiras antigas|publisher=Natugraf|year=2018|location=Brazil|language=Portuguese}}</ref>

During the [[American Civil War]], English textile industries ran out of cotton, which was imported from the Southern United States. Soon, manufactures from [[England]] started to search around the world for alternative places to cultivate cotton - one of them was the then-Province of São Paulo, which included Sorocaba. In 1862, Lieutenant-Colonel Francisco Gonçalves de Oliveira Machado started the first cotton plantation in Sorocaba. The local environment and weather were ideal, and the plantation flourished. The first harvest exceeded all expectations, starting another cycle of industrial and economic development. Several textile industries from England built branches in the city, changing the landscape with chimneys, saw-styled roofs, large, orange brick-built buildings and smoke. During this time, Sorocaba received the title of Manchester Paulista--"São Paulo native" in Portuguese, given the resemblance with its laboring [[Manchester|twin]] city.

With the opening of the [[Estrada de Ferro Sorocabana]] on June 20, 1872 and its transport of cotton products, animals and passengers to São Paulo, Sorocaba had a major leap in development. Six locomotives and 62 bandwagons were brought from [[England]], with seven stations initially planned.

[[Telegraph|Telegraphic services]] started on April 3, 1873. Years later, the railway expanded to the borders of the state, with Sorocaba station as the hub.

===Land relief===
The terrain is classified as a wavy strands and characterized by local ridges, with an average altitude of 632 meters above the sea level. The highest altitude is 1028 meters, in the Serra de Sao Francisco. The lower altitude is 539 meters, in the valley of the [[Sorocaba River]]. Sorocaba is located on the edge of the Peripheral Depression of São Paulo state, in the Appalachian Fall Line, as defined by Professor [[Aziz Ab'Saber]]. This configuration is due to the fact Sorocaba lies at the boundary between the Atlantic Plateau, which covers the area of crystalline rocks, with higher relief and the rocks of the [[Parana' Basin|Parana Sedimentary Basin]] and gently rolling topography with lower altitudes. The [[Sorocaba River]] and its hydrographic basin are responsible for the relief dissection.

===Soil===
The soil is characterized as red-yellow podzolic type, with gravelly clay, heavy clay, Typic dark clayey; oxisol with clay loam. Lithosols also occur, which are usually developed with little depressions.

===Vegetation===
The original natural vegetation was the Atlantic Forest, with local regions in a Montana Tropical Rainforest. Predominate the savannah vegetation in various stages of secondary succession.

===Geology===
Sorocaba is located exactly on the limit between the sedimentary rocks of [[Parana Basin|Parana Sedimentary Basin]] (Itararé Group, in glacial and deltaic palaeoenvironments of Permian-Carboniferous age) and crystalline basement (Neoproterozoic). Important [[granite]] massifs are Sorocaba Massif (calc-alkaline I-Type) and São Francisco Massif (Subalkaline, A-Type). Metamorphic low grade rocks as phyllites, metacalcareous, metarenites, are marine metassediments are included in Sao Roque Group ([[Neoproterozoic]]) with structural trend northeast-southwest. The [[Ipanema Hill]] or [[Ipanema Hill|Araçoiaba Ridge]] is a prominent and isolated topographic elevation, it comprises ultrabasic-alkaline intrusion age ([[Mesozoic]], Early [[Cretaceous]]), remnant of ancient [[volcano]]. It was the first iron mine, [[ironworks]] and metallurgy of Brazil, [[Royal St. John of Ipanema Iron Foundry|Ipanema]]. The ore was exploited from [[magnetite]], probably associated to [[carbonatite]] body.

==Industry==
Sorocaba's industrial park is well-served by roads, highways, and public transportation. The industrial park boasts more than 25&nbsp;million square meters and over 1,600 industries.

Its tools, automotive parts and pharmaceutics industry are the biggest in [[Brazil]].

The [[Ferroban]] railroad (formerly [[Sorocabana Railway]] and [[RFFSA|FEPASA]]) are connected to [[São Paulo]] and the [[Port of Santos|Santos]] Seaport, the largest seaport in South America. The railroad is also an important link to [[Mercosur]], reaching both [[Argentina]] and [[Bolivia]].

Sorocaba also boasts a dry port terminal, which provides efficient road linkages to the various ports and airports of the region including [[Sorocaba Airport|Bertram Luiz Leupolz Airport]], which has one of the busiest cargo terminals in the State. A second airport, with much higher traffic and passenger capacity is currently being planned for the upcoming years.
