It is situated on the slopes of the [[Aspromonte]], a long, craggy mountain range that runs up through the centre of the region.

As a major functional pole in the region, it has strong historical, cultural and economic ties with the city of [[Messina]], which lies across the strait in [[Sicily]], forming a metro city of less than 1 million people.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.strill.it/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=174146|title=Area dello Stretto: Messina rilancia|access-date=26 March 2015}}{{Dead link|date=May 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Reggio is the oldest city in the region, and during ancient times, it was an important and flourishing colony of [[Magna Graecia]]. Reggio has a modern urban system, set up after the catastrophic [[1908 Messina earthquake|earthquake of 1908]], which destroyed most of the city. Before that seismic event, the region has been subject to several other previous earthquakes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.protezionecivile-imbersago.com/rischio-sismico.html|title=L'Italia è un paese ad alto rischio sismico - Protezione Civile Imbersago|first=Massimo|last=Corno}}</ref> The seismicity is caused by Reggio being on the [[Eurasian Plate]] near the [[faultline]] where it meets the [[African Plate]] that runs through the strait, dividing the two European regions of Calabria and [[Sicily]] into two different tectonic regions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2017-01-southern-italy-earthquake-hazard-due.html|title=Southern Italy: Earthquake hazard due to active plate boundary|publisher=Phys.org|date=24 January 2017|accessdate=5 September 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://finestrainformativa.com/biblioteca/articolo/read/85227-what-caused-the-messina-earthquake|title=What caused the Messina earthquake?|publisher=Finestra Informativa|date=26 January 2022|accessdate=5 September 2022}}</ref>

It is a major economic centre for regional services and transport on the southern shores of the Mediterranean. Reggio, with [[Naples]] and [[Taranto]], is home to one of the most important archaeological museums, the prestigious [[Museo Nazionale della Magna Grecia|National Archaeological Museum of Magna Græcia]], dedicated to [[Ancient Greece]] (which houses the [[Riace bronzes|Bronzes of Riace]], rare example of [[Greek sculpture|Greek bronze sculpture]], which became one of the symbols of the city). Reggio is the seat, since 1907, of the Archeological Superintendence of Bruttium and Lucania. The city is home to [[Association football|football]] club [[Reggina 1914|Reggina]], that previously played in the [[Serie A|Italian top flight]].

The city centre, consisting primarily of [[Art Nouveau#Stile Liberty in Italy|Liberty]] buildings, has a linear development along the coast with parallel streets, and the promenade is dotted with rare [[magnolias]] and exotic [[palm (plant)|palm]]s. Reggio has commonly used popular nicknames: The "city of Bronzes", after the Bronzes of Riace that are testimonials of its Greek origins; the "city of [[Bergamot orange|bergamot]]", which is exclusively cultivated in the region; and the "city of [[Fata Morgana (mirage)|Fatamorgana]]", an optical phenomenon visible in Italy only from the Reggio seaside.{{cn|date=February 2022}}

==Etymology==
During its 3,500-year history Reggio has often been renamed. Each name corresponds with the city's major historical phases:

*{{Lang|grc-latn|Erythra}} ([[Greek language|Greek]] for 'red'), allegedly the name of the pre-Greek settlement.
*{{Lang|grc-latn|Rhegion}} ({{Lang|grc|Ῥήγιον}}), the Greek city from the 8th to the 3rd centuries BC.
*{{Lang|grc-latn|Phoibeia}} (after [[Apollo]]), a short period under [[Dionysius II of Syracuse]], in the 4th century BC.
*{{Lang|la|Regium}} or {{Lang|la|Rhegium}}, its first Latin name, during the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC.
*{{Lang|la|Rhegium Julii}} ({{Lang|la|Reggio Giulia}}), during the Roman Imperial period.
*{{Lang|ar-latn|Riyyu}}, Arabic name under the short domination by [[Emirate of Sicily]], between 10th and 11th centuries.
*{{Lang|mis|Rìsa}}<!-- Old Norman -->, under the [[Normans]], between the 11th and 12th centuries.
*{{Lang|ca|Regols}}, Catalan name under the [[Crown of Aragon]], in the late 13th century.
*{{Lang|it|Reggio}} or {{Lang|it|Regio}}, usual Italian name in the Middle and Modern age.
*{{Lang|it|Reggio di Calàbria}}, post [[Italian Unification]] (to be distinguished from {{Lang|it|Reggio di Lombardia}} or {{Lang|it|di Modena}} – located in northern Italy – which was renamed {{Lang|it|Reggio nell'Emilia}}).

The toponym of the city might derive from an Italic word {{Lang|itc|rec}} (meaning 'king', cognate with [[Latin]] {{Lang|la|rex}}). Ancient Greek and Roman etymologists derived it from the Greek {{transl|grc|regnynai}} ({{Lang|grc|ῥηγνυναι}}, 'break'), referring to a mythic earthquake in which Sicily was broken off from the Italian mainland.<ref name="ReferenceA">Alessandro Gioffrè d'Ambra and others ''Reggio Centro del Mediterraneo - un excursus storico di 3500 anni'', Club UNESCO 'Re Italo', Provincia di Reggio, Tipografia Enotria, Reggio di Calabria, May 2014</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Reggio Calabria}}

===Ancient times===
The history of the area before the arrival of the Greeks in the eighth century BC is not reliably known. Mythical accounts record a series of different peoples in the region, including the [[Osci]] (sometimes referred to as ''Opici''), [[Troy|Trojans]], [[Oenotrians]], [[Ligures]], [[Ausones]], [[Mamertines]], [[Taureani]], [[Sicels]], [[Morgetes]] and [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Itali]].<ref name="books.google.it">Domenico Spanò Bolani, ''Storia di Reggio – da' tempi primitivi sino all'anno 1797'' • Stamperia e Cartiere del Fibreno, Naples, 1857 [https://books.google.com/books?id=H6IBAAAAQAAJ]</ref> They also claim that the land around Reggio was first known as Saturnia, or Neptunia. The term 'Italia' initially referred to the area around Reggio itself, before expanding to cover present-day southern Calabria (later known as [[Bruttium]]), and finally becoming the name of the whole Italian peninsula around the third century BC.<ref name="books.google.it"/> Allegedly, the name derives from king [[Italus]], an Oenotrian king of the region.<ref>''Lessico Universale Italiano'' XI, "Italo", Enciclopedia Italiana Treccani, Roma, 1973.<!-- ISBN/ISSN needed --></ref>

After [[Cumae]], Reggio was one of the first Greek colonies in southern Italy. The colony was settled by the inhabitants of [[Chalcis]] in 730 or 743 BC<ref name="books.google.it"/> on the site of the older settlement, Erythra ({{Lang|grc|Ερυθρά}}), meaning 'red'. The legendary founder of the city was King Iocastus, son of [[Aeolus]], who was later said to be buried on the Punta Calamizzi promontory (called "Pallantion") and appeared on the city's coinage. The colony retained the name of "Rhegion" ({{Lang|grc|Ῥήγιον}}).<ref name="books.google.it"/> [[Pseudo-Scylax]] also writes that it was a Greek city.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/graeca/Chronologia/S_ante06/Skylax/sky_p001.html| title = Pseudo Scylax, Periplous, §12}}</ref>

Rhegion was one of the most important cities in [[Magna Graecia]], reaching great economic and political power during the 5th and 6th centuries BC under [[Anaxilas]], who reigned as tyrant from 494 to 476 BC. Anaxilas conquered [[Zancle]] (modern [[Messina]]), extending Rhegian control over both shores of the Straits of Messina. He attempted to conquer [[Locri]] as well in 477 BC but was rebuffed. When he died in 476 BC, his two sons were too young to rule, so power was held by their regent [[Micythus]]. Under his rule, Rhegion founded a colony, Pyxous (modern [[Policastro Bussentino]]) in [[Campania]] in 471 BC.<ref>[[Herodotus]] 7.170; [[Diodorus Siculus]] 11.52, 11.59.14.</ref> [[Hieron I of Syracuse]] orchestrated Micythus' removal from power in 467 BC,<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]] 11.66.1-3</ref> after which Anaxilas' sons ruled on their own until they were deposed in 461 BC.<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]] 11.76.5; [[Justin (historian)|Justin]] 4.3.1-3</ref> During the [[Peloponnesian War]], Rhegion allied with [[Athens]]. An Athenian inscription (''[[Inscriptiones Graecae|IG]]'' I<sup>3</sup> 53) reports a renewal of this alliance in 433 BC.<ref>[https://www.atticinscriptions.com/inscription/IGI3/53 Translation and commentary] on ''Attic Inscriptions Online''.</ref> The Athenians supported Rhegion in a war with Locri during the First Sicilian Expedition (427–425 BC).<ref>[[Thucydides]] 4.1.1-3</ref> However, when the Athenians launched the much larger [[Sicilian Expedition]] of 415–413 BC, Rhegion offered them only limited assistance.

During the [[Third Sicilian War]], Rhegion became hostile to [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]]. He attacked the city for the first time in 396 BC, but he was rebuffed. Dionysius destroyed the Rhegian navy in 389 BC, besieged the city again in 388 BC and, when it finally fell in 387 BC, destroyed it.<ref>[[Polybius]] 1.6.1, Diodorus Siculus 14.56.1-2, 108-111, 114-117</ref> His son, [[Dionysius II of Syracuse|Dionysius II]] refounded the city as 'Phoebeia' in the 360s BC. When he was expelled from Syracuse in 356 BC, he retained control of Phoebeia, but it was captured by Syracusan forces led by [[Leptines II|Leptines]] and [[Callippus of Syracuse|Callippus]] in 351 BC.<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]] 16.45.9</ref> Rhegion then reverted to its original name.<ref name="books.google.it"/>

Throughout classical antiquity Rhegion remained an important maritime and commercial city as well as a cultural centre, as is demonstrated by the presence of academies of art, philosophy, and science, such as the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] School, and also by its well-known poet [[Ibycus]], the historian [[:it:Ippi di Reggio|Ippys]], the musicologist Glaucus, and the sculptors [[Pythagoras of Rhegium|Pythagoras]] and [[Clearchus of Rhegium|Clearchus]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Rhegion made an alliance with the [[Roman republic]] in 282 BC, shortly before the [[Pyrrhic War]]. The {{ill|Legio Campana|de}}, under the command of Decius Vibellus, was installed as a garrison but subsequently launched a violent coup and seized control of the city.<ref>[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] 20.4. cf. [[Polybius]] 1.7.6-7, [[Diodorus Siculus]] 22.1.2-3</ref> Roman forces deposed Decius and restored the city's independence in 271 BC. Thereafter, Rhegium was an important ally of Rome, with the status of {{Lang|la|[[municipium]]}} and ''socia navalis'' (naval ally). It retained its Greek customs and language, as well as its [[mint (coin)|mint]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> It was a central pivot for both maritime and mainland traffic, reached by the final part of the [[Via Popilia]], which was built in the 2nd century BC and joined the older [[Via Appia]] at [[Capua]], south of Rome. Close to Rhegion, on the Straits of Messina, was the busy port of Columna Rhegina. Under the Emperor [[Augustus]], the city was renamed Rhegium Juli in honour of the emperor's adoptive father [[Julius Caesar]] and was the seat of the {{Lang|la|[[corrector|corrēctor]]}} (governor) of "Regio III Lucania et Bruttii" (the southernmost of the eleven [[Roman Italy#Augustan organization|regiones]] into which Italy was divided). In AD 61 the apostle [[St. Paul]] passed through Rhegium on his final voyage towards Rome,<ref>[[Book of Acts|Acts]] 28.13</ref> converting the first local Christians and, according to tradition, laying the foundations of the Christianization of Bruttium.

Rhegium boasted in imperial times nine thermal baths,<ref>De Gregorio, Lucia. "Le Terme Romane di Reggio Calabria. La ricerca archeologica tra il 1881 e il 1924", ''Calabria Sconosciuta'' n. 139/140– Azienda Grafica Biroccio, Reggio di Calabria (July–December 2013).</ref> one of which is still visible today on the sea-front. Due to its seismic activity, the area was often damaged by earthquakes, such as in 91 BC, AD 17, 305 and 374.<ref>AAVV "Reggio di Calabria" in "L'Italia - Basilicata e Calabria", Touring Club Italiano, La Repubblica, Pioltello, 2005</ref>

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Reggio Calabria Incisione Regno di Napoli.jpg|thumb|left|Reggio in a medieval engraving.]]
Numerous occupying armies came to Reggio during the early Middle Ages due to the city's strategic importance.

Invasions by the [[Vandals]], the [[Lombards]] and the [[Goths]] occurred in the 5th–6th centuries.{{cn|date=January 2023}} Then, under [[Byzantine]] rule, it became a metropolis of the Byzantine possessions in Italy and was also the capital of the [[List of Counts and Dukes of Apulia and Calabria|Duchy of Calabria]] several times between 536 and 1060 AD.{{cn|date=October 2022}} Following wars between the Lombards and Byzantines in the 6th century, Bruttium was renamed Calabria.{{cn|date=October 2022}}

As a Byzantine centre of culture, certain monks there undertook scribal work, carrying out the transcription of ancient classical works. Until the 15th century, Reggio was one of the most important Greek-rite Bishoprics in Italy—even today Greek words are used and are recognisable in local speech and Byzantine terms can be found in local liturgy, in religious icons and even in local recipes. During this period, constant migrations of Greeks fleeing the Slavic invasion of Peloponnese, further strengthened the Hellenic element of the city.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Slavs and nomadic populations in Greece|url=https://www2.rgzm.de/foreigners/cfm/themen/309/309_uk.cfm?Language=uk|access-date=2021-06-19|website=www2.rgzm.de|archive-date=2021-06-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624201538/https://www2.rgzm.de/foreigners/cfm/themen/309/309_uk.cfm?Language=uk|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Arabs occupied Reggio in 918 and held some of its inhabitants to ransom or kept them prisoners as slaves.<ref>''Western Europe on the Eve of the Crusades'', Sidney Painter, ''A History of the Crusades'', Vol. I, ed. Kenneth M. Setton and Marshall W. Baldwin, (University of Wisconsin Press, 1969), p. 50.<!-- ISBN needed --></ref> For brief periods in the 10th–11th centuries the city was ruled by the [[Arabs]] and, renamed {{Lang|ar-latn|Rivàh}} (or sometimes {{Lang|ar-latn|Rŷu}}), became part of the [[Emirate of Sicily]]. During the period of Arab rule various beneficial ideas were introduced into Calabria, such as citrus fruit trees, mulberry trees (used in [[silk]] production) and several ways of cooking local vegetables such as aubergines. The Arabs introduced water ices and ice cream and also greatly improved agricultural and hydraulic techniques for irrigation.<ref name="ReferenceA" />

In 1005, a Christian fleet coming from [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] sacked the city and massacred all the Saracens to the great jubilation of the local population.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Campagnano |first=Gabriele |date=2017-06-01 |title=Pisa e gli Arabi: il Mito di Kinzica (1005) |url=https://zweilawyer.com/2017/06/01/pisa-e-gli-arabi-il-mito-di-kinzica-1005/ |access-date=2022-10-28 |website=Zhistorica |language=it-IT}}</ref> In 1060 the [[Italo-Normans|Normans]], under [[Robert Guiscard]] and [[Roger I of Sicily]], captured Reggio but Greek cultural and religious elements persisted until the 17th century. In 1194 Reggio and the whole of southern Italy went to the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]], who held it until 1266. In 1234 the town fair was established by decree of King [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]].<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

From 1266 it was ruled by the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]], under whom life in Calabria deteriorated because of their tendency to accumulate wealth in their capital, Naples, leaving Calabria in the power of local barons.<ref name="ReferenceB">Mario Caligiuri, ''Breve Storia della Calabria''. Newton & Compton, Rome, 1996</ref> In 1282, during the [[Sicilian Vespers]], Reggio rallied in support of [[Messina]] and the other oriental Sicily cities because of the shared history, commercial and cultural interests. From 1147 to 1443 and again from 1465 to 1582, Reggio was the capital of the Calabrian ''Giustizierato''. It supported the [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]] forces against the House of Anjou. In the 14th century it obtained new administrative powers.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>  In 1459, the Aragonese enlarged its medieval castle.{{cn|date=April 2022}}

Reggio, throughout the Middle Ages, was first an important centre of [[calligraphy]] and then of [[printing]] after its invention. It boasts the first dated, printed edition of a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] text, a [[Rashi]] commentary on the [[Pentateuch]], printed in 1475 in [[La Giudecca]] of Reggio,<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/rr/amed/guide/hs-books.html "The Books of the People of the Book – Hebraic Collections"], Library of Congress, Washington, DC; accessed 26 March 2015.</ref> even though scholars consider Rome as the city where Hebrew printing began.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The Jewish community of Reggio was also considered to be among the foremost internationally, for the dyeing and the trading of [[silk]]: silk woven in Reggio was esteemed and bought by the Spaniards, the Genoese, the Dutch, the English and the Venetians, as it was recognised as the best silk in the Kingdom of Naples.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Early modern period===
From the early 16th century, the Kingdom of Naples was under the [[Habsburgs]] of [[Spain]], who put Reggio under a viceroy from 1504 to 1713. The 16th and 17th centuries were an age of decay due to high Spanish taxes, pestilence, the 1562 earthquake, and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turkish invasions suffered by Reggio between 1534 and 1594. In 1534, facing attack by an Ottoman fleet under [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]], the townspeople abandoned Reggio. Barbarossa captured eight hundred of those who remained and then burned the town.<ref>Roger Crowley, Empires of the Sea, faber and faber 2008 p.58</ref> After [[Barbary pirates]] attacked Reggio in 1558, they took most of its inhabitants as slaves to [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]].<ref>Jamil M. Abun-Nasr. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jdlKbZ46YYkC&pg=PA191 ''A history of the Maghrib in the Islamic period''], pg. 191.<!-- ISBN needed --></ref>

In 1714, southern Italy became once more property of the Austrian Habsburgs, who remained until 1734, when they were replaced by the [[Bourbons]] of Spain.{{cn|date=January 2023}} Reggio was the capital of Calabria Ulteriore Prima from 1759 to 1860. In 1783, a disastrous [[1783 Calabrian earthquakes|earthquake]] damaged Reggio, all of southern Calabria and [[Messina]].

The precious citrus fruit, [[Bergamot orange]], had been cultivated and used in the Reggio area since the 15th century. By 1750 it was being grown intensively in the Rada Giunchi area of Reggio and was the first plantation of its kind in the world.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In 1806, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] took Reggio and made the city a [[Duchy]] and General Headquarters. After the former's fall, in 1816, the two ancient Kingdoms of Naples and of Sicily were unified, becoming the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]].

During the course of the 19th century new public gardens were laid out, the piazzas (or squares) were embellished and cafés and a theatre were opened. On the newly opened sea promenade a Civic Museum was inaugurated. In fact, some 60 years after the devastation caused by the 1783 earthquake, the English traveller and painter [[Edward Lear]] remarked "Reggio is indeed one vast garden, and doubtless one of the loveliest spots to be seen on earth. A half-ruined castle, beautiful in colour and picturesque in form, overlooks all the long city, the wide straits, and snow-topped Mongibello beyond."<ref>Edward Lear, ''Journals of a landscape painter in Southern Calabria'', R. Bentley, London, 1852</ref>

On 21 August 1860, during the ''{{Ill|Battaglia di Piazza Duomo|it|4=fr|5=Bataille de Reggio|6=ru|7=Взятие Реджо-ди-Калабрия}}'' (Cathedral Square Battle), [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] conquered the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]].

On 28 December 1908, at 5:21 am, the town was hit by a heavy earthquake and shook violently for 31 seconds. Damage was even worse in Messina across the Straits. It is estimated that 25,000 people perished in Reggio and 65,000 in Messina. Reggio lost 27% of its inhabitants and Messina lost 42%. Ten minutes after the catastrophic earthquake, those who tried to escape by running towards the open spaces of the coast were engulfed by a 10-metre-high [[tsunami]]. Three waves of 6–12 metres swept away the whole waterfront. The [[1908 Messina earthquake]] remains one of the worst on record in modern western European history.<ref>[http://www.calabrialiving.com/1908earthquake.htm Reggio Calabria commemorates its 1908 earthquake victims], on Calabria Living</ref><ref>[http://www.seismosoc.org/publications/SRL/SRL_80/srl_80-2_hs.html The 28 December 1908 Messina Straits Earthquake (Mw 7.1): A Great Earthquake throughout a Century of Seismology]{{Dead link|date=August 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Historical Seismologist, March/April 2009.</ref>

During the World War II, due to its strategic military position, it suffered a devastating air raid and was used as the [[Operation Baytown|invasion target]] by the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]] in 1943, which led to the city's capture. After the war Reggio recovered considerably. During 1970–71 the city was the scene of a popular uprising—known as the [[Reggio riots|Moti di Reggio]]—against the government choice of [[Catanzaro]] as capital of the newly instituted Region of Calabria.<ref name="partridge50">Partridge, [https://books.google.com/books?id=I-5OR8tDkEIC&dq=1970+revolt+reggio+calabria&pg=PA50 ''Italian politics today''], p. 50.<!-- ISBN, publishing info needed --></ref> The revolt was taken over by young [[neofascism|neofascists]] of the [[Italian Social Movement]], backed by the [['Ndrangheta]], a [[Mafia]]-type criminal organisation based in Calabria.<ref name="paoli198">Paoli, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'', p. 198.<!-- ISBN, publishing info needed --></ref><ref name="ind040296">[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/town-the-mafia-shut-down-1317203.html Town the mafia shut down], ''The Independent'', 4 February 1996.</ref> The Reggio Calabria protests were the expression of malcontent about [[cronyism]] and the lack of industrial planning. In the 1970s and 1980s, Reggio went through twenty years of increasing organized crime by the 'Ndrangheta as well as urban decay. The town is home to several {{Lang|it|[['ndrine]]}}, such as the [[Pasquale Condello|Condello]]-[[Antonio Imerti|Imerti]] and the [[De Stefano 'ndrina|De Stefano]]-[[Giovanni Tegano|Tegano]] clans, who were involved in bloody wars against each other during this period.<ref name="obs240208">[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/24/internationalcrime.italy Godfather's arrest fuels fear of bloody conflict], ''The Observer'', 24 February 2008.</ref> The 'Ndrangheta extorts protection money ([[Pizzo (extortion)|''pizzo'']]) from every shop and viable business in town and has more power than the city council in awarding licences to retailers.<ref name=ind040296/>

The spiral of corruption reached its zenith in the early 1990s. The sitting mayor at the time, {{Ill|Agatino Licandro|it}}, made a confession reporting "suitcases coming into city hall stuffed with money but going out empty". As a result of the nationwide corruption scandals most of the city council was arrested.<ref name="ind040296"/> Since the early 1990s, the so-called "Primavera di Reggio" (Reggio Spring)—a spontaneous movement of people and government institutions—encouraged city recovery and a renewed and stronger identity.

On 9 October 2012, the Italian government decided to dissolve the city council of Reggio Calabria for infiltration by the 'Ndrangheta.

===Earthquakes in history===
{{main|List of earthquakes in Italy}}
Reggio has been destroyed by earthquakes several times over the centuries, such as in 91 BC, after which the city was reconstructed by order of the Emperor Augustus, followed by another in the year 17 AD; yet another one in 305 AD, and again another in 374. In 1562 one destroyed the natural, medieval port of the city and brought about the submersion of the Calamizzi promontory, known in ancient times as the Pallantiòn, where, we are told, the first Greek settlers, the Calcidesi, had set foot. The particularly devastating of 1783 and that of 1908, which was the worst natural calamity to take place in Europe in human memory, both profoundly altered the urban aspect of the city, due to the successive re-building which gave the present-day layout of straight, intersecting roads, planned by [[Giovanbattista Mori]] in 1784 and by {{Ill|Pietro de Nava|it}} in 1911. But some town-planning policies at the time were decided upon with no respect for the architectural history of Reggio, as is shown by the demolition of the remaining Norman part of the Castle, following the last big earthquake in 1923.<ref>Giuseppe Caruso, "Il Castello Aragonese di Reggio Calabria" · Caruso Edizioni, Reggio di C, 2016</ref>

===European travellers who visited Reggio===
Although Reggio and Calabria in general were less popular destinations than [[Sicily]] or [[Naples]] for the first Northern European travellers, several famous names such as the Flemish [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]] (in c. 1550), the German {{Ill|Johann Hermann von Riedesel|it|4=de|5=Johann Hermann Riedesel zu Eisenbach|6=fr}} (in 1767), the Frenchmen [[Jean-Claude Richard|Jean Claude Richard de Saint-Non]] (in 1778) and [[Stendhal]] (in 1817), the British travellers [[Henry Swinburne]] (in c. 1775), [[Richard Keppel Craven]] (in c. 1820), [[Craufurd Tait Ramage]] (in 1828), the Strutt family and [[Elizabeth Byron]] (in 1840), [[Edward Lear]] (in 1847), [[Norman Douglas]] (in 1911), [[D. H. Lawrence]] (in c. 1920) and [[Eric Whelpton]] (in 1950s) and the Belgian [[Jules Destrée]] (in 1915 and in 1930) visited Reggio.<ref>AA VV (attualmente a cura di: Carmelina Sicari, Gaetanina Sicari Ruffo, Luciana Polimeni, Sara Polimeni, Cettina Nostro, Antonio Maria Leone; fondata da Giuseppe Polimeni) ''Calabria Sconosciuta'' · case editrici varie, redazione in Reggio di Calabria, 1978~2013</ref>

==Geography==
With an exceptionally high population density, Reggio Calabria was cited as having the least [[Open space reserve|green space]] in a study of 386 European cities. The study reported that green space coverage varied markedly, averaging 18.6 per cent and "ranging from 1.9 (Reggio di Calabria, Italy) to 46 ([[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]], Spain) per cent." The study further reported "Per capita green space provision varied by two orders of magnitude, from 3 to 4 m<sup>2</sup> per person in Cádiz, Fuenlabrada and Almería (Spain) and Reggio di Calabria (Italy) to more than 300 m<sup>2</sup> in [[Liège]] ([[Belgium]]), [[Oulu]] ([[Finland]]) and [[Valenciennes]] ([[France]])."<ref name="green_space_study">{{cite journal | pmc=2679924 | year=2009 | last1=Fuller | first1=R.

This includes the [[Aspromonte National Park]].

===Climate===
According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], Reggio Calabria possesses a typical [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa''). Its climate has warmer days and cooler nights than [[Messina]] which lies on the other side of the strait. Precipitation is another big difference since Messina receives approximately {{convert|300|mm|0|abbr=on}} more.

===New waterfront: Museum and Performing Arts Centre===
The new waterfront, designed by architect [[Zaha Hadid]], is located on a narrow strait separating [[Italy]] from [[Sicily]]. The museum (13,400 m<sup>2</sup>) draws inspiration from the organic form of the starfish, utilizing a radial symmetry to coordinate communication and circulation between different program elements: exhibition spaces, restoration facilities, archive, aquarium and library. A second, multifunctional building (8,000 m<sup>2</sup>), comprises two separate elements, placed around a partially covered piazza. It houses offices, gyms, craft laboratories, cinema and flexible auditoria.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.archiportale.com/news/2009/02/architettura/a-londra-la-firma-per-il-waterfront-di-reggio-calabria_13993_3.html|title=A Londra la firma per il waterfront di Reggio Calabria|publisher=archiportale.com|access-date=26 March 2015}}</ref>
