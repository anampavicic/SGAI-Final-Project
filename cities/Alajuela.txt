==History==
[[Image:Ermita de El Llano de José Manuel Morera Cabezas.jpg|thumb|left|160px|El Llano old hermitage]]
In pre-Columbian times the land where the canton of Alajuela is today was part of the [[Western Huetar Kingdom]], which was inhabited by native tribes, who at the time of the Spanish conquest were led by [[King Garabito|Chief Garabito]].

The first Spanish settlers established settlements in the region in about 1650.<ref name="Ocampo Barrantes 2009">Ocampo Barrantes, Marlon. "Los Orígenes de la Población de Alajuela, 1601-1782". Editorial UNED, Costa Rica, 2009.</ref> In a letter of obligation granted in 1764, the place is mentioned as La Lajuela in the Valley of Barva, near the Canoas river.

In 1777, the dwellers of La Lajuela and Ciruelas, having been served with notice to move to Villa Vieja (today's Heredia), requested the provisional construction of a public place of prayer in the house of Don Dionysius Oconitrillo, of Spanish origin, 30 metres north of where Alajuela's cathedral is today.

After increases of population in the five existing quarters then: Targuaz, Puás, Ciruelas, La Lajuela and Rio Grande, the citizens faced difficulties to maintain their religious obligations, so they requested permission to establish a parish and a public place of prayer from the Bishop of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, Monsignor don Esteban Lorenzo de Tristán.<ref name="Ocampo Barrantes 2009"/>

According to a motion issued in the Spanish Parliament of [[Cádiz]] on 19 May 1812, the first town hall of Alajuela was founded in 1813. On 18 December of the same year, the La Lajuela quarter obtained the title of town and it was renamed. It was first called "Villa Hermosa", then it was called "San Juan Nepomuceno de Alajuela" and finally the title of city was granted on 20 November 1824 and with it the name "Alajuela" which remains today.

Participation in important historical events by citizens of Alajuela has ensured the city's reputation as a storied place in Costa Rican history. The national hero Juan Santamaría, who died during the [[Filibuster War|Filibuster War in 1856]] to remove invaders threatening Costa Rica's sovereignty, was born in Alajuela. This historical event is celebrated and remembered every year on 11 April and it is a national holiday.

The area often experiences earthquakes. The [[2009 Costa Rica earthquake|2009 magnitude 6.1 earthquake]] caused several landslides.<ref>{{Cite news

==Economy==
The main exports of the region are coffee, sugar-cane, maize, beans, tobacco, citrus fruits, strawberries, tubers like cassava, flowers and ornamental plants. Other commercial activities include poultry farming, beekeeping, pig farming and the dairy industry. More recently, Alajuela has seen important investment in free zone parks and heavy industry companies, with a considerable number of them dedicated to manufacturing a variety of medical devices.

==Transportation==
Alajuela is an important transport hub for the country, connecting the [[San José, Costa Rica|capital city of San José]] with northwestern Costa Rica. As a part of the [[Greater Metropolitan Area (Costa Rica)|Greater Metropolitan Area]], most of the inhabitants of Alajuela work in other cities or regions of the Central Valley, and every day receives residents from other locations to work in local factories.
