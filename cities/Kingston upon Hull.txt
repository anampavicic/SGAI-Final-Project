===Wyke and wool trade===
Kingston upon Hull stands on the north bank of the [[Humber Estuary]] at the mouth of its tributary, the [[River Hull]]. The valley of the River Hull has been inhabited since the early [[Neolithic]] period but there is little evidence of a substantial settlement in the area of the present city.<ref>{{cite web

It was originally an outlying part of the hamlet of Myton, named Wyke. The name is thought to originate either from a Scandinavian word ''Vik'' meaning inlet or from the Saxon ''Wic'' meaning dwelling place or refuge.<ref>

The River Hull was a good haven for shipping, whose trade included the export of wool from [[Meaux Abbey]], which owned Myton. In 1293, the town of Wyke was acquired from the abbey by King Edward I, who, on 1 April 1299, granted it a [[royal charter]] that renamed the settlement ''King's town upon Hull'' or Kingston upon Hull. The charter is preserved in the archives of the [[Guildhall, Kingston upon Hull|Guildhall]].<ref name="VCHULL">{{cite book

In his ''Guide to Hull (1817)'', J. C. Craggs provides a colourful background to Edward's acquisition and naming of the town. He writes that the King and a hunting party started a hare which "led them along the delightful banks of the River Hull to the hamlet of Wyke ... [Edward], charmed with the scene before him, viewed with delight the advantageous situation of this hitherto neglected and obscure corner. He foresaw it might become subservient both to render the kingdom more secure against foreign invasion, and at the same time greatly to enforce its commerce". Pursuant to these thoughts, Craggs continues, Edward purchased the land from the Abbot of Meaux, had a manor hall built for himself, issued proclamations encouraging development within the town, and bestowed upon it the royal appellation, ''King's Town''.<ref name="Craggs">{{cite book

===Prospering port===
The port served as a base for Edward I during the [[First War of Scottish Independence]] and later developed into the foremost port on the east coast of England. It prospered by exporting wool and woollen cloth, and importing wine and timber.

From its medieval beginnings, Hull's main trading links were with Scotland and northern Europe. Scandinavia, the Baltic and the Low Countries were all key trading areas for Hull's merchants. In addition, there was trade with France, Spain and Portugal.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

The town prospered during the 16th and early 17th&nbsp;centuries,<ref name="VCHULL"/> and Hull's affluence at this time is preserved in the form of several well-maintained buildings from the period, including [[Wilberforce House]], now a museum documenting the life of [[William Wilberforce]].<ref name="VCHULL"/>

During the [[English Civil War]], Hull became strategically important because of the large [[arsenal]] located there. Very early in the war, on 11 January 1642, the king named the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]] governor of Hull while Parliament nominated Sir [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|John Hotham]] and asked his son, Captain John Hotham, to secure the town at once.<ref name="VCHULL"/> Sir John Hotham and Hull corporation declared support for [[roundhead|Parliament]] and denied [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] entry into the town.<ref name="VCHULL"/> Charles I responded to these events by [[Siege of Hull (1642)|besieging the town]].<ref name="VCHULL"/> This siege helped precipitate open conflict between the forces of Parliament and those of the [[Cavalier|Royalists]].<ref name="VCHULL"/>

After the Civil War, docks were built along the route of the [[Fortifications of Kingston upon Hull|town walls]], which were demolished. The first dock (1778, renamed [[Queen's Dock, Hull|Queen's Dock]] in 1854) was built in the area occupied by Beverley and North gates, and the intermediate walls, which were demolished, a second dock ([[Humber Dock, Hull|Humber Dock]], 1809) was built on the land between Hessle and Myton gates, and a third dock between the two was opened 1829 as [[Junction Dock, Hull|Junction Dock]] (later [[Prince's Dock, Hull|Prince's Dock]]).<ref>{{cite book| first1 = Edward |last1 = Gillett| first2 = Kenneth A. |last2 = MacMahon| title = A History of Hull|publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 1980| isbn = 0-19-713436-X | pages = 220‚Äì4}}</ref>

Parallel to this growth in passenger shipping was the emergence of the [[Wilson Line of Hull]] (which had been founded in 1825 by [[Thomas Wilson (shipping magnate)|Thomas Wilson]]). By the early 20th&nbsp;century, the company had grown ‚Äì largely through its monopolisation of North Sea passenger routes and later mergers and acquisitions ‚Äì to be the largest privately owned shipping company in the world, with over 100 ships sailing to different parts of the globe.

Following the [[Local Government Act 1888]], Hull became a [[county borough]], a local government district independent of the East Riding of Yorkshire. This district was dissolved under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], on 1 April 1974 when it became a [[non-metropolitan district]] of the newly created [[shire county]] of Humberside.

Kingston upon Hull is on the northern bank of the [[Humber Estuary]].<ref name="enc_brit"/> The city centre is west of the River Hull and close to the Humber.<ref name="enc_brit"/> The city is built upon [[alluvium|alluvial]] and glacial deposits which overlie chalk rocks but the underlying chalk has no influence on the topography. The land within the city is generally very flat and is only 2 to 4&nbsp;metres (6.5 to 13&nbsp;ft) [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Because of the relative flatness of the site there are few physical constraints upon building and many open areas are the subject of pressures to build.<ref>{{cite web

The parishes of [[Drypool]], [[Marfleet]], [[Sculcoates]], and most of Sutton parish, were absorbed within the borough of Hull in the 19th and 20th&nbsp;centuries. Much of their area has been built over, and socially and economically they have long been inseparable from the city. Only Sutton retained a recognisable village centre in the late 20th&nbsp;century, but on the south and east the advancing suburbs had already reached it. The four villages were, nevertheless, distinct communities, of a largely rural character, until their absorption in the borough‚ÄîDrypool and Sculcoates in 1837, Marfleet in 1882, and Sutton in 1929.<ref>{{cite book

Some areas of Hull lie on reclaimed land at or below sea level. The Hull Tidal Surge Barrier is at the point where the River Hull joins the Humber Estuary and is lowered at times when unusually high tides are expected. It is used between 8 and 12 times per year and protects the homes of approximately 10,000 people from flooding.<ref>{{cite web

===Climate===
Located in [[Northern England]], Hull has a temperate maritime climate which is dominated by the passage of mid-latitude depressions. The weather is very changeable from day to day and the warming influence of the [[Gulf Stream]] makes the region mild for its latitude. Locally, the area is sunnier than most areas this far north in the British Isles, and also considerably drier, due to the rain shadowing effect of the Pennines. It is somewhat warmer than west coast areas at a similar latitude such as [[Liverpool]] in summer due to stronger shielding from maritime air but also colder in winter and North Sea breezes keep the city cooler than inland areas during summer. It is also one of the most northerly areas where the July average maximum temperature exceeds {{convert|21.5|C|F}}, although this appears to be very localised around the city. Flooding in June 2007 caused significant damage to areas of the city. Droughts and heatwaves also occur such as in 2003, 2006 and recently in 2018.<ref>{{cite web

The animals are further represented on the Albany Street 'Home Zone' a project involving local residents and resulting in sculptures of a hippo ('Water Horse') at the bottom of Albany Street; an elephant balancing on its trunk on an island in the middle; and two bears climbing poles and reaching out to each other to form an open archway across the entrance to Albany Street from Spring Bank. Other sculptural details of animals along the street represent the participation of street residents, either through workshops with artists and makers, or through independent work of their own.<ref>{{cite web

Built by 1963 and later home to [[British Home Stores|BHS]], the building closed in 2016 with the collapse of BHS retail stores and was scheduled for demolition due to [[asbestos]] content. The building was listed as [[Grade II]] after lobbying by local pressure group Hull Heritage Action Group, potentially preventing demolition of the mural-wall. Specialist spraying to seal the building's internal structure has enabled moves to determine the actual level of asbestos in the mural-wall itself and provided a possible solution to incorporate the wall into a new development.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Young |first1=Angus |title=New twist in the battle to save Hull's iconic Three Ships mural |url=https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/three-ships-mural-city-centre-3843517 |access-date=17 April 2021 |work=Hull Daily Mail |date=13 February 2020}}</ref>

Hull is the only city in the UK with its own independent telephone network company, KCOM, formerly KC and Kingston Communications, a subsidiary of [[KCOM Group]]. Its distinctive cream [[telephone booth|telephone boxes]] can be seen across the city. KCOM produces its own 'White Pages' telephone directory for Hull and the wider KC area. Colour Pages is KCOM's business directory, the counterpart to [[Yellow Pages]]. The company was formed in 1902 as a municipal department by the City Council and is an early example of municipal enterprise. It remains the only locally operated telephone company in the UK, although it is now privatised. KCOM's Internet brands are Karoo Broadband (ISP serving Hull) and Eclipse (national ISP).<ref>{{cite web

==Dialect and accent==
The local [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] is quite distinctive and noticeably different from the rest of the East Riding; however it is still categorised among [[Yorkshire dialect and accent|Yorkshire accent]]s. The most notable feature of the accent is the strong [[I-mutation]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/linguistics/WPL/WP1999/watt.doc |title=A Spectrographic Analysis Of Vowel Fronting In Bradford English |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319171244/http://www.leeds.ac.uk/linguistics/WPL/WP1999/watt.doc |archivedate=19 March 2006 |first=Dominic |last=Watt |first2=Jennifer |last2=Tillotson|type=Microsoft Word Document|accessdate= 9 November 2006}}</ref> in words like ''goat'', which is {{IPA|[Àà…°…ô ät]}} in [[standard English]] and {{IPA|[Àà…°oÀêt]}} across most of Yorkshire, becomes {{IPA|[Àà…°…µÀê îtÃö ]}} ("''gert''") in and around parts of Hull (cf. similar ''refined'' pronunciations in [[Leeds]]/[[York]]), although there is variation across areas and generations.<ref name=BBCHull/>
In common with much of England (outside of the far north), another feature is dropping the H from the start of words, for example Hull is more often pronounced 'Ull in the city. The vowel in "Hull" is pronounced the same way as in northern English, however, and not as the very short {{IPA|/ ä/}} that exists in Lincolnshire. Though the rhythm of the accent is more like that of northern Lincolnshire than that of the rural East Riding, which is perhaps due to migration from Lincolnshire to the city during its industrial growth, one feature that it does share with the surrounding rural area is that an {{IPA|/a…™/}} sound in the middle of a word often becomes an {{IPA|/…ëÀê/}}: for example, "five" may sound like "fahve", "time" like "tahme".<ref>{{cite web
