'''Konya'''{{efn|{{IPA|tr|ˈkoɲ.ja}}}} is a major city in central [[Turkey]], on the southwestern edge of the [[Central Anatolia Region|Central Anatolian Plateau]], and is the capital of [[Konya Province]]. During antiquity and into Seljuk times it was known as '''Iconium'''.  In 19th-century accounts of the city in English its name is usually spelt '''Konia''' or '''Koniah'''. In the late medieval period, Konya was the capital of the [[Seljuk Turks]]' [[Sultanate of Rum]], from where the sultans ruled over Anatolia.

As of 2023, the population of the Metropolitan Province was just over 2.3 million, making it the [[list of cities in Turkey|sixth most populous city in Turkey]], and second most populous of the [[Central Anatolia Region]], after [[Ankara]]. Konya is served by [[TCDD Taşımacılık|TCDD]] high-speed train ([[Yüksek Hızlı Tren|YHT]]) services from [[Istanbul]], [[Ankara]] and [[Karaman]]. The local airport ([[Konya Airport|Konya Havalimanı]], KYA) is served by frequent flights from [[Istanbul]] whereas flights to and from [[İzmir]] are offered few times a week.

== Name ==

Konya is believed to correspond to the [[Late Bronze Age]] toponym ''Ikkuwaniya'' known from [[Hittites|Hittite]] records.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=South Central: The Lower Land and Tarḫuntašša |encyclopedia=Hittite Landscape and Geography |year=2017 |last=Forlanini  |first= Massimo |editor-last1=Weeden |editor-first1=Mark |editor-last2=Ullmann |editor-first2=Lee |publisher=Brill| doi=10.1163/9789004349391_022|page=244|isbn=978-90-04-34939-1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Bryce |first=Trevor|title=The Trojans and their neighbours |date=2006 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=9780415349550 |page=81}}</ref> This placename is regarded as [[Luwian language|Luwian]] in origin.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Klein |first1=Jared |last2=Joseph |first2=Brian |last3=Fritz |first3=Matthias |title=Handbook of Comparative and Historical Indo-European Linguistics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQA2DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA239 |year=2017 |publisher=[[de Gruyter]] |isbn=978-3-11-026128-8 |page=239}}</ref> During [[classical antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]] it was known as {{lang|grc|Ἰκόνιον}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|Ikónion}}) in [[List of traditional Greek place names|Greek]] (with regular [[Medieval Greek]] [[apheresis (linguistics)|apheresis]] {{lang|grc-x-medieval|Kónio(n)|script=Latn}}) and as {{lang|la|Iconium}} in [[Latin]]. <ref>{{cite book |last=Bryce |first=Trevor|title=The Trojans and their neighbours |date=2006 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=9780415349550 |page=81}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Klein |first1=Jared |last2=Joseph |first2=Brian |last3=Fritz |first3=Matthias |title=Handbook of Comparative and Historical Indo-European Linguistics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQA2DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA239 |year=2017 |publisher=[[de Gruyter]] |isbn=978-3-11-026128-8 |page=239}}</ref>

A [[folk etymology]] holds that the name {{lang|grc-Latn|Ikónion}} was derived from {{lang|grc|εἰκών}} ('[[icon]]'), referring to an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Greek mythology|legend]] according to which the hero [[Perseus]] vanquished the native population with an image of the "''[[Gorgon]] [[Medusa]]'s head''" before founding the city.<ref name="Britannica">{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/321948/Konya |title=Konya |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=25 May 2015 }}</ref>

Konya was known as {{lang|tr|Dârülmülk}} to the [[Sultanate of Rum|Rum Seljuk]]s.<ref>{{TDV İslâm Ansiklopedisi |url=https://islamansiklopedisi.org.tr/konya |title=KONYA İç Anadolu bölgesinde şehir ve bu şehrin merkez olduğu il }}</ref>

== History ==

=== Overview ===
The Konya region has been inhabited since the third millennium BC and fell at different times under the rule of [[Hittites|the Hittites]], [[Phrygia|the Phrygians]], the [[Greeks]], the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. In the 11th century the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk Turks]] conquered the area and began ruling over its [[Rûm]] ([[Byzantine|Byzantine Greek]]) inhabitants, making Konya the capital of their new [[Sultanate of Rum]]. Under the Seljuks, the city reached the height of its wealth and influence. Following their demise, Konya came under the rule of the [[Karamanids]], before being taken over by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 15th century. After the [[Turkish War of Independence]] the city became part of the modern Republic of Turkey.

=== Ancient history ===

[[File:Konya Archaeological Museum, Turkey 04.jpg|170px|thumb|right| A marble statue of [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], the [[Ancient Greek]] goddess located in [[Konya Archaeological Museum]]]]
[[File:Konya_archeological_museum_-_sarcophagus1.jpg|thumb|200px|Marble Sarcophagus, typical of Pamphylia. Roman period, 3rd century AD, in the [[Konya Archaeological Museum]]]]
Excavations have shown that the region was inhabited during the Late [[Copper Age]], around 3000&nbsp;BC.<ref name=Britannica />

The [[Phrygia]]ns established their kingdom in central [[Anatolia]] in the eighth century BC and [[Xenophon]] describes Iconium (as the city was originally called) as the last city of Phrygia. The region was overwhelmed by [[Cimmerians|Cimmerian]] invaders {{circa|690 BC}}. Later it formed part of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], until [[Darius III]] was defeated by [[Alexander the Great]] in 333&nbsp;BC. Alexander's empire broke up shortly after his death and the town came under the rule of [[Seleucus I Nicator]].

During the [[Hellenistic period]] the town was ruled by the kings of [[Pergamon]]. As [[Attalus III]], the last king of Pergamon, was about to die without an heir, he bequeathed his kingdom to the [[Roman Republic]]. Once incorporated into the [[Roman Empire]], under emperor [[Claudius]], the city's name was changed to Claudiconium. During the reign of emperor [[Hadrian]]us it was known as Colonia Aelia Hadriana.

=== Saint Paul and Iconium ===
Paul and [[Silas]] probably visited Konya during Paul's [[Missionary journeys of Paul|Second Missionary Journey]] in about AD&nbsp;50,<ref>{{cite book|last=Ramsay |first=William Mitchell|title=The Cities of St. Paul|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JryEbmKool0C&pg=PA315 |year=1908|publisher=A.C.

According to the [[apocryphal]] [[Acts of Paul and Thecla]], Iconium was also the birthplace of [[Thecla|Saint Thecla]], who saved the city from attack by the [[Isaurians]] in 354.<ref name="ODB" />

=== Byzantine Era===

Under the [[Byzantine Empire]], the city became the seat of a bishop, and in {{circa|370}} was raised to the status of a [[Metropolis of Iconium|metropolitan see]] for [[Lycaonia]], with [[Saint Amphilochius]] as the first metropolitan bishop.<ref name="ODB">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ikonion |last=Foss |first=Clive |page=985 |editor-first=Alexander |editor-last=Kazhdan |editor-link=Alexander Kazhdan |encyclopedia=[[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] |location=London and New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-19-504652-6}}</ref> In the 7th century it became part of the [[Anatolic Theme]] and was, together with the nearby (Caballa) [[Kaballah Fortress]] ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Gevale Kalesi'') ([https://www.google.com/maps/place/37%C2%B054'06.4%22N+32%C2%B023'13.3%22E/@37.9017802,32.3848373,843m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d37.9017757!4d32.3870263 location]) a frequent target of [[Arabs|Arab]] attacks during the [[Arab–Byzantine wars]] in the eighth to tenth century,<ref name="ODB" /> being captured by Arabs in 723–724.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Whittow |first1=Mark |title=The Making of Byzantium, 600-1025 |date=1996 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520204966 |page=138 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFh-ASmKksYC |access-date=6 October 2023}}</ref> The rebellious general [[Andronikos Doukas (general under Leo VI)|Andronikos Doukas]] used the Kaballah fortress as his base in 905–906.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Heald Jenkins |first1=Romilly James |title=Byzantium The Imperial Centuries, AD 610–1071 |date=1987 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=9780802066671 |page=204 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O5JqH_NXQBsC |access-date=6 October 2023}}</ref> During the tenth or eleventh century the church of Saint Amphilochius was constructed inside the citadel of Kaballa, housing the tomb of the saint which the Turks later believed to be the tomb of  [[Plato]], renaming the church to Eflâtun Mescidi (mosque of Plato).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tekinalp |first1=V.

The [[Seljuk Turks]] first raided the area [[Battle of Iconium (1069)|in 1069]], but a period of chaos overwhelmed Anatolia after the Seljuk victory in the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, and the [[Normans|Norman]] mercenary leader [[Roussel de Bailleul]] rose in revolt at Iconium. The city was finally conquered by the Seljuks in 1084.<ref name="ODB" />

Iconium became the second capital of the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] [[Sultanate of Rum]] after the [[siege of Nicaea|fall of Nicaea]] until 1243.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hiro |first=Dilip |title=Inside Central Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=498oDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT76 |year=2011 |publisher=Gerald Duckworth & Company|isbn=978-0-7156-4038-8|page=76}}</ref> It was briefly occupied by the army of the [[First Crusade]] (August 1097) and [[Frederick Barbarossa]] (May 18, 1190) after the [[Battle of Iconium (1190)]]. The area was reoccupied by the Turks after the Crusaders left.

Konya reached the height of its wealth and influence in the second half of the 12th century when the Seljuk sultans of Rum also subdued the [[Anatolian beyliks]] to their east, especially that of the [[Danishmends]], thus establishing their rule over virtually all of eastern [[Anatolia]],. They also acquired several port towns along the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] (including [[Alanya]]) and the [[Black Sea]] (including [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinop]]) and even gained a brief foothold in [[Sudak]], [[Crimea]]. This golden age lasted until the first decades of the 13th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Many [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Persianized Turks|Persianised Turks]] from [[Persia]] and [[Central Asia]] migrated to Anatolian cities either to flee the [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran|invading Mongols]] or to benefit from the opportunities for educated Muslims in a newly established kingdom.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mango|first=Andrew|author-link=Andrew Mango|title=Discovering Turkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WkRaAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA61|year=1972|publisher=Hastings House|isbn=0-8038-7111-2|page=61|oclc=309327}}</ref>

Following the fall of the [[Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]] in 1307, Konya became the capital of the [[Karamanids]], a [[Anatolian beyliks|Turkish beylik]], which lasted until 1322 when the city was captured by the neighbouring [[Karamanids|Beylik of Karamanoğlu]]. In 1420, the Beylik of Karamanoğlu fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]] and, in 1453, Konya was made the provincial capital of the [[Karaman Eyalet]].

=== Ottoman Empire ===
{{Main|Ottoman Empire|Karaman Eyalet|Vilayet of Konya}}

Under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, Konya was administered by the [[Şehzade|Sultan's sons (''Şehzade'')]], starting with Şehzade Mustafa and [[Sultan Cem|Şehzade Cem]] (the sons of Sultan [[Mehmed II]]), and continuing with the future Sultan [[Selim II]].

Between 1483 and 1864, Konya was the administrative capital of the [[Karaman Eyalet]]. During the reforming [[Tanzimat]] period, it became the seat of the larger [[Vilayet of Konya]] which replaced the Karaman Eyalet, as part of the new [[vilayet]] system introduced in 1864.

In 1832 Anatolia was invaded by [[Muhammad Ali dynasty|Mehmed Ali Paşa]] of [[Kavala]] whose son, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|İbrahim Paşa]], occupied Konya. Although he was driven out with the help of the European powers, Konya went into a decline after this, as described by the British traveller, William Hamilton, who visited in 1837 and found a scene 'of destruction and decay', as he recorded in his ''Researches in Asia Minor, Pontus and Armenia'',  published in 1842.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Freely |first=John |title=The Western Interior of Turkey |publisher=SEV |year=1998 |isbn=9758176226 |edition=1st |location=Istanbul |pages=235–36 |language=English}}</ref>

During the [[Turkish War of Independence]] (1919–1922) Konya was a major [[Turkish Air Force#Initial stages|air base]]. In 1922, the air force, renamed as the Inspectorate of Air Forces,{{efn|Turkic:Kuva-yı Havaiye Müfettişliği}} was headquartered in Konya.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hvkk.tsk.tr/EN/IcerikDetay.aspx?ID=21|title=Bir Hata Oluştu|website=Hvkk.tsk.tr|access-date=25 May 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505145921/http://www.hvkk.tsk.tr/EN/IcerikDetay.aspx?ID=21|archive-date=5 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Kocatürk|first=Utkan|title=Atatürk ve Türkiye Cumhuriyeti tarihi kronolojisi, 1918–1938|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5sAfAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA634|year=1983|publisher=Türk Tarih Kurumu Basımevi|language=tr|page=634}}</ref>
Before 1923, 4,000 Orthodox, [[Karamanlides|Turkish-speaking]] and Greek-speaking Christians lived there. The Greek community numbered approximately 2,500 people who maintained, at their own expense, a church, a boys' school and a girls' school.
In 1923 during the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], the [[Greeks]] of the nearby village of Sille were forced to leave as refugees and resettle in [[Greece]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exchange.ifmsa.org/exchange/explore/lc/4690946|title=IFMSA Exchange Portal|website=Exchange.ifmsa.org|access-date=7 August 2018}}</ref>

The first local administration in Konya was founded in 1830 and converted into a municipality in 1876.{{efn|"İhtisab Agalıgi" (Islamic-Ottoman office for public regularity)}} In March 1989, the municipality became a Metropolitan Municipality. As of that date, Konya had three central district municipalities (Meram, Selçuklu, Karatay) and a Metropolitan Municipality.

== Culture ==
[[File:Mevlana_Cultural_Center,_Konya.jpg|thumb|200px|Mevlana Cultural Centre in Konya]]
Konya has a reputation for being one of the more religiously conservative metropolitan centres in Turkey.<ref>{{cite web |date=2004-12-03 |title='Islam problem' baffles Turkey |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4062603.stm |access-date=2019-08-29 |website=BBC News}}</ref>

Konya was the final home of [[Rumi]] (Mevlana), whose turquoise-domed tomb in the city is its primary tourist attraction. In 1273, Rumi's followers established the [[Mevlevi Order|Mevlevi]] [[Sufi]] order of [[Islam]] and became known as the [[Sufi whirling|Whirling Dervishes]].

Every Saturday, there are Whirling Dervish performances ([[Sama (Sufism)|semas]]) at the Mevlana Cultural Centre. Unlike some of the commercial performances staged in cities like Istanbul, these are genuinely spiritual sessions.

Expensive, richly patterned Konya [[Turkish carpet|carpet]]s were exported to Europe during the [[Renaissance]]<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i3Od9bcGus0C&pg=PA189|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts|last=Campbell|first=Gordon|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-19-518948-3|volume=1|page=189|chapter=Carpet II: History}}</ref> and were draped over furniture to show off the wealth and status of their owners. They often crop up in [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting|contemporary oil paintings]] as symbols of the wealth of the painter's clients.<ref>{{cite web |title=Carpets of the Ottoman Period |website=Old Turkish Carpets |date=2019-06-19 |url=http://www.oldturkishcarpets.com/carpets-ottoman-period.html |access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref>
