Moshi attained the status of a town in 1956.<ref name="Moshi background information"/> In 1988, it became a municipality under Tanzanian law, but as of 31 October 2014, the process for submitting its application to become a city was in its final stages.<ref>[http://www.dailynews.co.tz/index.php/local-news/37772-moshi-quest-for-city-status-well-underway] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103040505/http://www.dailynews.co.tz/index.php/local-news/37772-moshi-quest-for-city-status-well-underway|date=November 3, 2014}}</ref> Moshi is administratively divided into 21 wards and then subdivided into 60 hamlets.<ref name="Moshi background information" />

== Economy ==
As the capital of the region, it is the center of government activities, trade, finance, and tourism. In the first half of the 20th century, Moshi was traditionally an important railway town, center of banana agriculture, and commercial producer of [[pyrethrum]].<ref name="Gunther" />

=== Tourism ===
Moshi is one of tourism centers in the northern safari circuit of Tanzania. The closest tourism spots include [[Kilimanjaro National Park]], [[Mkomazi National Park]], [[Lake Jipe]], and [[Lake Chala]]. There are also several waterfalls, natural springs, and tropical forests. Tours can also be arranged from Moshi to other areas such as [[Serengeti National Park]], [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]], [[Arusha National Park]], [[Lake Manyara National Park]], and [[Tarangire National Park]]. The city has several hotels and recreation centers.

There is annual fair, [[Kilifair|KiliFair]], organized to be an international tourism & industry fair, promoting and presenting companies based in the Kilimanjaro region.

Just south of the city, there is a sugar production facility by TPC Ltd which owns one of the largest and oldest sugar cane plantation in the country. There are several small and medium scale manufacturing facilities in dairy and food packaging sector.

=== Agriculture ===
Moshi's lower altitude and drier climate mean that the main crops grown on the higher slopes of [[Mt Kilimanjaro]], coffee<ref name="KNCU">[http://www.grolink.se/epopa/publications/Proj-folders/KNCU.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812093433/http://www.grolink.se/epopa/publications/Proj-folders/KNCU.pdf|date=August 12, 2010}}</ref> and bananas,<ref name="elisanet1">[http://www.elisanet.fi/esoini/Own_docs/WP%202002-1%20changing%20landscapes.pdf] {{dead link|date=January 2016}}</ref> do not thrive there. The surrounding areas in Moshi district are known for extensive farms of maize and beans, grown once per year during the long rainy season (known as "masika" in Kiswahili). In addition, the Tanganyika Planting Company operates a very large sugar cane plantation and company town {{convert|20|km|mi}} south of Moshi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajol.info/index.php/tjs/article/viewFile/18405/29859|title=PESTICIDE RESIDUES IN WATER FROM TPC SUGARCANE PLANTATIONS AND ENVIRONS, KILIMANJARO REGION, TANZANIA|author1=H Hellar|author2=MA Kishimba|website=Ajol.info|format=PDF|access-date=2016-01-08}}</ref>

In recent years, efforts have been made to diversify Moshi's agricultural economy beyond traditional coffee production. In 2019, a dairy cooperative located on the eastern slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro partnered with the Poland-East Africa Economic Foundation and Polish Aid to boost dairy farming in the region. The cooperative expanded significantly, benefiting over 900 local farmers and establishing new facilities to support milk production and processing<ref>{{Cite web |title=A dairy cooperative on eastern slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro expands its activity by cooperating with Poland – East Africa Economic Foundation and Polish Aid - Polish aid - Gov.pl website |url=https://www.gov.pl/web/polishaid/a-dairy-cooperative-on-eastern-slopes-of-mount-kilimanjaro-expands-its-activity-by-cooperating-with-poland--east-africa-economic-foundation-and-polish-aid |access-date=2024-10-24 |website=Polish aid |language=en-GB}}</ref>

TATCOT is a supra-regional training centre providing courses in the field of orthopaedic technology in Africa and enrols students from all English speaking African countries as well as other interested countries. The reason for establishing these courses was to educate the professionals who are required to provide technical services to people with amputations and other neuromuscular disorders such as poliomyelitis, paralysis, cerebral palsy, clubfoot and trauma. In order to do this the professionals are provided with the knowledge and skills to provide prostheses, orthoses, wheelchairs and supportive seating to people with disabilities.

== Medical care ==
The main private hospital in the area is the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC), a zonal referral hospital. This complex has more than 450 beds and serves a population of over {{Nowrap|11 million}} individuals. The Good Samaritan Foundation of Tanzania founded KCMC in March 1971.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcmc.ac.tz |title=Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre |website=Kcmc.ac.tz |date=2013-05-14 |access-date=2016-01-08}}</ref>

Next to KCMC is the Kilimanjaro Centre for Community Ophthalmology (KCCO), which was founded in 2001 and is co-directed by Dr. Paul Courtright and Dr. Susan Lewallen. A new three-story building for KCCO was finished in 2007, funded by several individuals and non-governmental organizations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kcco.net/Donorsandsupportersofthekcco.html |title=Donors and supporters of KCC |access-date=2012-01-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120907234156/http://www.kcco.net/Donorsandsupportersofthekcco.html |archive-date=2012-09-07 }}</ref> The KCCO is "dedicated to the elimination of avoidable blindness through programmes, training, and research focusing on the delivery of sustainable and replicable community ophthalmology services".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kcco.net/orgstrinance.html |title=About KCCO |access-date=2012-01-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120803142157/http://www.kcco.net/orgstrinance.html |archive-date=2012-08-03 }}</ref> The KCCO has an "official memorandum of understanding ... with the Department of Ophthalmology and Kilimanjaro Christian Medical College under which the KCCO assumes or shares responsibility (subject to specific funding grants) for many teaching activities, running workshops and seminars, supervising the ...

Moshi also hosts the [[Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Institute (KCRI)|Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Institute]] (KCRI), which is the research arm of KCMC. KCRI evolved from the Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Centre (KCRC) in 2009.

The primary public hospital in Moshi is the [[Mawenzi Regional Hospital]], which started sometime before 1920 as a small dispensary for German soldiers and became a hospital in 1956. The hospital has about 300 beds but is severely underfunded. In late 2010, its surgical services were suspended indefinitely by the Government and Private Hospitals Inspection Committee of the Tanzanian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. The head of the committee, Dr. Pamella Sawa, said, "During our inspection, we inspected the theatre room of Mawenzi Hospital and found it very dirty, with no[t] enough ventilation, the situation which is dangerous not only to the patient but also to his/her attendant...."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailynews.co.tz/home/?n=15896 |title=Daily News &#124; Theatre services suspended at Mawenzi Regional Hospital |access-date=2012-01-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120729161050/http://www.dailynews.co.tz/home/?n=15896 |archive-date=2012-07-29 }}</ref> The hospital includes a Care and Treatment Centre for people living with HIV/AIDS.

== Climate ==
Moshi has a [[tropical wet and dry climate]]. Its weather is dominated year round by [[monsoon]]al flow. The northeast monsoon prevails December through March and is accompanied by the highest temperatures of the year. The southeast monsoon prevails from June through September. Unique among the world's monsoons, both monsoons in Tanzania are divergent in the low levels, shallow (averaging only {{convert|2|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=off}} in depth), and capped by inversion and dry, subsiding air. These factors result in light or insignificant rainfall year-round except during the transitional periods between the monsoons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/forecaster_handbooks/SouthAfricaAtlantic_IO/Southern%20African%20Continent%20%26%20Atlantic-Indian%20Ocean.05.pdf |title=Archived copy |website=www.nrlmry.navy.mil |access-date=15 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224185003/http://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/forecaster_handbooks/SouthAfricaAtlantic_IO/Southern%20African%20Continent%20%26%20Atlantic-Indian%20Ocean.05.pdf |archive-date=24 December 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The East African monsoons and their effects on agriculture - Springer |doi=10.1007/BF00257708 |s2cid=155673314 }}</ref>
