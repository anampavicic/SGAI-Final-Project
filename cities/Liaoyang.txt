==History==
{{Further|Xiangping}}
[[File:Battle of Liaoyang1621.jpg|thumb|left|280px|[[Nurhaci]] captured Liaoyang in 1621 and made it the capital of his empire until 1625.]]
Liaoyang is one of the oldest continuously-inhabited cities in northeast China, dating back to before the [[Warring States period]], and the site of the city has not changed ever since.<ref>{{cite news |title=国务院正式批复！辽阳成为第135座国家历史文化名城 |url=https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_10314055 |publisher=thepapaer.cn |date=7 December 2020}}</ref> Under the [[Yan (state)|Yan state]] and the [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] and [[Han dynasty|Han]] dynasties, Liaoyang (then known as Xiangping) was the capital of [[Liaodong Commandery]] and the political center of the Liaodong region. During the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, the city was the focus of [[Sima Yi]]'s devastating [[Sima Yi's Liaodong campaign|Liaodong campaign]]. From the 5th to 7th centuries, Liaoyang was on the northern edge of the [[Goguryeo]] kingdom. Remains of Yodong and Baegam, the old Goguryeo cities, can still be seen near the modern city. This was the site of a major battle between the Tang and Goguryeo in 645 AD. 

Liaoyang rose to prominence during the [[Liao dynasty]]. Several buildings in the city date to this period. Among these is the White Pagoda (baita), which dates back to 1189 in the [[Liao Dynasty]] with additions during the [[Yuan dynasty]].<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> The Liaoyang White Pagoda sits in Baita Park within Baita district in the centre of the city. Next to the park is Guangyou Temple, one of the oldest and largest temple complexes in the north east of China covering some {{convert|60,000|m2}}.

Under the [[Jurchen Jin dynasty]], the city served as their empire's eastern capital under the name '''Dongjing''' ({{lang|zh-hant|東京}}).<ref name="chiknojin">Theobald, Ulrich. ''China Knowledge''. "[http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Song/jinn-map.html Chinese History - Jin Dynasty 金 (1115-1234): Map and Geography]". Accessed 19 Oct 2012.</ref>

In the 17th century, the Manchu people rose up against the [[Ming dynasty]] of China. Liaoyang was one of the first Ming cities to fall and [[Nurhaci]], the new Emperor of the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Later Jin dynasty]], made his capital there naming the city Dongjing in 1621. He also moved the tombs of several family members to Liaoyang and they can still be seen in Dongjingling, just east of the city. As the Manchu expanded, they again moved the capital to [[Shenyang]] in 1625. After this Dongjing faded in importance. Today, remains of the city walls can still be seen and a small museum stands within the reconstructed south gate.

The year 1900 saw the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China. Russian troops camped in Liaoyang city, burning the ancient Guangyou temple. On the August 24 September 1904,{{Clarify|date=August 2018}} the [[Battle of Liaoyang]] took place. This was a major battle of the [[Russo-Japanese war]].

Liaoyang was one of the major centres of the [[Manchurian revival]], a Protestant [[Christian revival]] which took place in Mukden ([[Shenyang]]) and the surrounding countryside in 1908.

The city was the site of widespread labor protests in March 2002 that were sparked by the [[bankruptcy]] and subsequent [[liquidation]] of the Liaoyang Ferroalloy Factory, or Liaotie. The protesters were workers from at least seven different factories, including failing textile, chemical, piston, instruments, leather, and precision tool plants. Their grievances involved local [[Corruption in China|government corruption]] and widespread worker layoffs coupled with [[arrears|arrearage]] in employee wages, pensions and unemployment benefits. The activists demanded compensation for what they were owed, an investigation into the bankruptcy of Liaotie, and the resignation of the chairman of the local [[National People's Congress|legislature]], Gong Shangwu. The protests were eventually dispersed after several days by the government after declaring a [[curfew]] under [[martial law]]. Two of the workers' representatives, Xiao Yunliang and Yao Fuxin, were given prison terms of four and seven years, respectively. The government also responded by paying most but not all of the money that the workers were owed, and by ordering an investigation into the charges of corruption at Liaotie which culminated in the arrest and thirteen-year prison sentence of its manager, Fan Yicheng, for smuggling and fraudulent dereliction of duty. The provincial governor who approved the Liaotie bankruptcy was also imprisoned for accepting bribes, but Gong Shangwu evaded punitive action.<ref>Philip P.

==Tourism==
The largest park within the city is Baita park. There are several historical sites to be visited. The new Liaoyang Museum, open to the public since 2009, contains many antiques. Guangyou temple beside the Baita (White Pagoda) has become one of Liaoyang's main tourism attraction in recent years. The first temple on the site dates back to 1145. The temple was destroyed by Russian troops during the 1900 Boxer Rebellion but was later rebuilt.<ref>{{cite web
