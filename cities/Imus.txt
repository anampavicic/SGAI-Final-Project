'''Imus''' ({{IPA|tl|ˈʔimus}}), officially the '''City of Imus''' ({{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Imus}}), is a 1st class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] and ''[[de jure]]'' [[Capital city|capital]] of the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Cavite]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 496,794 people.{{PH census|current}}

It is the ''[[de jure]]'' capital of the province of [[Cavite]], located {{convert|20|km|sp=us}} south of [[Metro Manila]], when President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] decreed the transfer of the seat of the provincial government from [[Trece Martires]] on June 11, 1977. However, most offices of the provincial government are still located in Trece Martires. Imus was officially converted into a city following a referendum on June 30, 2012.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/799150/bacoor-imus-now-cities|title=Bacoor, Imus now cities|last=Calica|first=Aurea|date=April 22, 2012|work=The Philippine Star|access-date=September 29, 2016|via=philstar.com}}</ref>

Imus was the site of two major [[Katipunan|Katipunero]] victories during the [[Philippine Revolution]] against [[Spanish Empire|Spain]]. The [[Battle of Imus]] was fought on September 3, 1896, and the Battle of Alapan, on May 28, 1898, the day when the first Philippine flag was flown making Imus the "Flag Capital of the Philippines". Both events are celebrated annually in the city. The Imus Historical Museum honors the city's history with [[historical reenactment]] of scenes from the revolution.

==Etymology==
The name Imus comes from [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] ''[[wikt:imos|imos]]'' or ''imus'', meaning "[[Cape (geography)|cape]]" or "[[headland]]."<ref name="Lesho">{{cite book |last1=Lesho |first1=Marivic |last2=Sippola |first2=Eeva |title=Vergleichende Kolonialtoponomastik Strukturen und Funktionen kolonialer Ortsbenennung |date=2018 |publisher=De Gruyter |chapter=Toponyms in Manila and Cavite, Philippines |isbn=9783110608618 |pages=317–332}}</ref>

==History==
{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2022}}

===Early history===
[[File:Bridge_of_Isabel_II_in_Imus,_Cavite_1899.jpg|thumb|left|The Bridge of Isabel II in Imus in 1899 with the missing northern span blown up by the revolutionaries, temporarily replaced by a wooden plank.]]
Like [[Cavite City]] (originally called ''Cavite La Punta'') and [[Noveleta]] (''La Tierra Alta''), Imus used to be a part of Cavite el Viejo (now [[Kawit]]), whose [[parish church]] was built by the [[Jesuits]] during the administration of [[Archdiocese of Manila]] [[Archbishop]] Miguel Garcia Serrano, 1618–1629. For more than a century and a half the people of Imus had to endure walking or traveling {{convert|4.5|km|sp=us}} of dirt road to attend religious services or transact official business in the city proper. The difficulty of communication between Imus and Cavite el Viejo was a long-standing complaint of the Imuseños until another religious order, the [[Augustinian Recollects]], as a consequence of the [[British occupation of Manila]] in 1762, established a parish church in Imus, in what is now known as Bayang Luma.

However, the [[Church (building)|church]] site was far from the estate house of the {{convert|11100|ha|acre}} [[hacienda]] acquired in 1686 by the Recollect Corporation, and when the church was destroyed by the strong [[typhoon]] of September 1779, the Recollect Friars transferred it to barrio Toclong, and finally to sitio de Balangon, now the city plaza of Imus.

With the establishment of the Recollect parish the people of Imus gained their religious emancipation from the Jesuit-run parish of Cavite el Viejo. The Recollects, however, would not be content with little victory or achievement. In 1774, Recollect Fr. Pedro San Buenaventura petitioned the government to "separate the ''inquilinos'' (tenants) of Imus from the political jurisdiction of the government of "Cavite el Viejo". After a considerable time of waiting, the petition was granted and Imus became an independent municipality on October 3, 1795.

On May 28, 1898, Imus gained its independence from Spanish colonial rule after the last remaining stronghold of forces from the Spanish empire had been defeated in the [[Battle of Alapan]] as headed by General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. This battle led to the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence]] in Kawit, Cavite June 12, 1898. The modern flag of the Philippines was first unfurled in victory during this battle as they march their way to the present day Cavite City, together with the captured forces of Spain.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Aguinaldo|first1=Emilio|title=Exhibit No. 71|journal=Philippine Insurgent Records|volume= 1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Presidential Proclamation No. 374|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1965/03/06/proclamation-no-374-s-1965/|website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|access-date=February 1, 2015|date=March 6, 1965}}</ref> In commemoration of the event, a Battle of Alapan marker was constructed inside the compound of Alapan Elementary School on May 28, 1998, and was inaugurated by President [[Fidel V. Ramos]]. Although on May 28, 2014, a new marker and the Imus National Heritage Park were inaugurated at Barangay Alapan 2-A to make the initially constructed marker more accessible to the public.

On October 15, 1903, the [[Taft Commission|Philippine Commission]] enacted Act No. 947, merging the adjacent towns of [[Bacoor]] and [[Dasmariñas|Perez-Dasmariñas]] with Imus.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=947|title=An Act Reducing the Twenty-Three Municipalities of the Province of Cavite to Eleven|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%20947|date=October 15, 1903|accessdate=June 17, 2023}}{{Dead link|date=September 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Bacoor was later separated from Imus in 1906, followed by Perez-Dasmariñas in 1917.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=1551|title=An act increasing the number of municipalities in the province of Cavite from eleven to twelve, by separating from Imus the former municipality of Bacoor and giving the latter the territory which it comprised prior to the passage of act numbered 947|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%201551|date=October 24, 1906|accessdate=June 17, 2023}}</ref>

===Modern history===
On June 11, 1977, then President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] issued Presidential Decree No. 1163, which transferred the provincial capital of Cavite from [[Trece Martires]] to Imus City. There is no other enabling law after that, that specifies the capital of Cavite<ref name="QFCavite">[http://www.cavite.gov.ph/home/index.php/general-information/quick-facts "Quick Facts"]. Cavite Province Official Website. Retrieved on August 25, 2012.</ref>

On May 28, 2008, [[Flag Day|National Flag Day]], the city celebrated the ''First Wagayway Festival'' (Flag-Waving Festival) signifying the very first unfurling of the [[Flag of the Philippines]] during the Battle of Alapan on May 28, 1898, against the [[Spain|Spanish colonizers]].  The battle was a major victory for General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] (later the first president of the Philippine Republic) during the [[Philippine Revolution]], which eventually led to the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence]] from Spain on June 12, 1898, in nearby [[Kawit]], [[Cavite]].  The five-day event was highlighted by the [[historical reenactment]] of events from the sewing of the flag by Filipino exiles in [[Hong Kong]], the Battle of Alapan, to the defeat of the Filipinos by the American troops silencing the dreams of an independent Philippines.  The reenactment included students, city employees and barangay officials.<ref name="Wagayway"/>

The festival was launched by then mayor, Emmanuel Maliksi, who reminded the people that the core of the celebration is love and respect for the Philippine flag, which symbolizes freedom and love for the country.  Among the guests present was the former Prime Minister of the Philippines, [[Cesar Virata]], who is a grandnephew of General Emilio Aguinaldo.<ref name="Wagayway">Sauler, Erika (June 2, 2008).

===Barangays===
Imus is politically subdivided into 97 [[barangay]]s. Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s and some have [[sitios]].

These barangays are grouped into two local and national electoral districts officially called Imus West and Imus East, which are represented in the Congress by their respective representatives and city council by their respective councilors. In 1998, the town was composed of 21 barangays; these former barangays were further subdivided to make the current collection of 97. The barangays which have been divided into multiple pieces carry the original barangay name, distinguished by capital letters if the name ends in numbers; for example, Medicion 1 is subdivided into Medicion 1-A, Medicion 1-B, etc.  Names ending in letters (such as Bucandala, Bayan Luma, etc.) are distinguished by numbers (Bucandala 1, Bayan Luma 2, etc.). The only exceptions to this rule are Barangay Buhay na Tubig and the Barangays inside Bahayang Pag-asa Subdivision, namely Mariano Espeleta I to III, Pinagbuklod, Magdalo, Maharlika and Bahayang Pag-asa (later renamed ''Bagong Silang'').<ref name=LWUA-Imus>{{cite web|title=Barangay Population Data; Municipality of Imus|url=http://122.54.214.222/population/|website=Local Water Utilities Administration|access-date=January 21, 2016|archive-date=January 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110024633/http://122.54.214.222/population/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the 2020 census, the population of Imus, was 496,794 people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|496,794/64.70|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.

===Religion===
The majority of the inhabitants of Imus are Christian, composed mostly of Catholics, Protestants, [[Members Church of God International]], [[Aglipayans]], and of other various sects. There is also sizable population of Muslims due to the influx of migrants from Mindanao.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

Imus is the [[Episcopal see|see]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Imus|Diocese of Imus]], which is coterminous with the province. [[Imus Cathedral]], which is under the [[patron saint|patronage]] of the [[Canonical coronation|canonically-crowned]] [[Nuestra Señora del Pilar de Imus]] ([[Our Lady of the Pillar|Our Lady of the Pillar of Imus]]), is the seat of the Bishop of the [[Diocese of Imus]]. The city served as the host diocese during the [[World Youth Day|5th Asian Youth Day]] on November 20–27, 2009.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

Imus is the foremost banking center of [[Cavite]] with numerous financial institutions and also an excellent banking infrastructure is being propagated by the present government to spearhead the development of the city. The city of Imus has shown a steady rise in its income earning a 1st class [[Municipalities of the Philippines#income classification|income classification]] in 1986. Its {{convert|9701|ha|adj=on|sp=us}} land area serves as home to a population of 195,482. In 1993, Imus had 1,369 commercial establishments, 200 manufacturing establishments and 41 financial institutions. Ten years hence, it has 6,636 licensed business establishments that include 4,376 commercial establishments, 300 manufacturing establishments and 190 financial institutions.

With a comfortable {{convert|18|km|abbr=on|sp=us}} distance from [[Metro Manila]], Imus serves as a favorable site for industrial establishments such as the {{convert|200|ha|sp=us|adj=on}} Imus Informal Industrial Estate and Anabu Hills Industrial Estate. Corporations that are 100% Filipino-owned include Annie's Candy Manufacturing, Inc., CKL Industries and Liwayway Mktg. Corp. Factories of partly Filipino-owned corporations include Champan Garment Corp., Hayag Motorworks & Machine Shop and San Miguel-Yamamura Asia Corp.. Foreign-owned corporations include Frontline Garments Corp. and EDS MFG, Inc., which produces automotive wiring harness. Imus is also the home of the Anabu Handmade Paper Products, a producer of handmade paper and paper products.

The Imus Commercial/Business District along Nueño Avenue (also called Imus Boulevard) is the center of commerce in the city. The Imus Public Market (''Pamilihang Bayan ng Imus'') is the hub of trade in the district. The market is divided into 25 zones and has 805 stalls. Commercial, industrial and manufacturing industries owned by [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and Filipino investors can also be found there. There are 3,601 commercial establishments duly registered in the city as of March 1999.

Eighteen major industrial establishments with a total capitalization of 1.311&nbsp;billion pesos have established their base at the Imus Informal Industrial Estate providing local employment to an estimated 13,478 people as of December 1998.{{update inline|date=October 2017}} Located just along the stretch of the General Emilio Aguinaldo Highway, the main highway of Cavite traversing the city from north to south, the 200-hectare informal industrial estate houses manufacturing companies owned by foreign and Filipino investors. Imus has ventured to the export of automotive wire harness and electrical components, acrylic sheets and lighting fixtures, [[processed food]]s, [[shellcraft]], [[bamboo]], [[rattan]] and woodcraft, furniture, garments and novelty items to other countries. Several subdivisions and mass housing projects and the establishment of factories and small-scale industries in many of its barangays have resulted in a movement of population into the city.

However, heavy traffic congestion caused by the 'buhos' (pour) system,{{Clarify|date=March 2013}} inadequate road signage and systems, poor road maintenance, mixed vehicles (tricycles, pedicabs, bicycles, etc.), unjustified traffic priority schemes and rampant violation of traffic rules is observable on roads. This is causing headaches to travelers specifically along Aguinaldo Highway. In an attempt to improve road conditions, traffic lights were installed in Aguinaldo highway and on other busy intersections in the city in 2015.

Ayala Land Inc. is investing Php 70 B for an estate "Vermosa", it will be accessible by Muntinlupa-Cavite Expressway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://business.inquirer.net/198354/ayala-invests-p70b-in-vast-cavite-estate-vermosa|title=Ayala invests P70B in vast Cavite estate Vermosa|date=September 2, 2015}}</ref>

Agriculture, particularly rice production, is still practiced in the city. {{clear-left}}
