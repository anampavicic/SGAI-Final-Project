{{nihongo|'''Mie Prefecture'''|三重県|Mie-ken|lead=yes}} is a [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]] of [[Japan]] located in the [[Kansai region]] of [[Honshu]].<ref>Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "Mie prefecture" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 628|page=628}}; "Kansai" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 477|page=477}}</ref> Mie Prefecture has a population of 1,781,948 ({{as of|2019|06|01|lc=y}}) and has a geographic area of {{convert|5774|km2|sp=us}}. Mie Prefecture is bordered by [[Gifu Prefecture]] to the north, [[Shiga Prefecture]] and [[Kyoto Prefecture]] to the northwest, [[Nara Prefecture]] to the west, [[Wakayama Prefecture]] to the southwest, and [[Aichi Prefecture]] to the east.

[[Tsu, Mie|Tsu]] is the capital and [[Yokkaichi]] is the largest city of Mie Prefecture, with other major cities including [[Suzuka, Mie|Suzuka]], [[Matsusaka]], [[Ise, Mie|Ise]], and [[Kuwana, Mie|Kuwana]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Tsu" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 995|page=995}}</ref>{{rp|page=995}} Mie Prefecture is located on the eastern coast of the [[Kii Peninsula]], forming the western side of [[Ise Bay]] which features the [[Mouth (river)|mouths]] of the [[Kiso Three Rivers]]. Mie Prefecture is a popular [[tourism]] destination home to [[Nagashima Spa Land]], [[Suzuka International Racing Course]], and some of the oldest and holiest sites in [[Shinto]], the [[traditional religion]] of [[Japan]], including the [[Ise Grand Shrine]] and the [[Tsubaki Grand Shrine]].

== History ==
[[File:Naiku 01.JPG|thumb|left|Ise Shrine]]
{{See also|Historic Sites of Mie Prefecture}}
Until the [[Meiji Restoration]], the area that is now Mie Prefecture was made up of [[Ise Province]], [[Shima Province]], [[Iga Province]], and part of [[Kii Province]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Provinces and prefectures" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 780|page=780}}</ref>

Evidence of human habitation in Mie dates back more than 10,000 years. During the [[Jōmon period|Jōmon]] and [[Yayoi period|Yayoi]] periods, agricultural communities began to form along the river and coastal areas of the region. [[Ise Shrine]] is said to have been established during the Yayoi period, and in the 7th century the [[Saikū|Saikū Imperial Residence]] was built in what is now [[Meiwa, Mie|Meiwa Town]] to serve as both a residence and administrative centre for the [[Saiō]], an Imperial Princess who served as High Priestess of Ise Shrine.

During the [[Edo period]], the area now known as Mie Prefecture consisted of several [[feudalism in Japan|feudal]] domains, each ruled by an appointed lord. Transport networks, including the Tokaido and Ise Roads, were built. Port towns such as Ohminato, [[Kuwana, Mie|Kuwana]] and Anōtsu, posting stations and castle towns flourished. Pilgrimages to Ise Shrine also became very popular.

After the [[Meiji Restoration]], the former provinces of Ise, Shima and Iga as well as a portion of eastern [[Kii Province|Kii]], were organized and reorganized repeatedly. In 1871, the area from the [[Kiso Three Rivers]] in the north to present-day [[Tsu, Mie|Tsu]] became Anōtsu Prefecture, and the area south of that became Watarai Prefecture. In 1872, the Anōtsu prefectural seat moved from Tsu to [[Yokkaichi, Mie|Yokkaichi]], and the prefecture itself was renamed Mie. For a variety of reasons, including the strong likelihood that Mie would eventually merge with Watarai, the prefectural seat returned to Tsu the following year, and Mie Prefecture took its present-day form in 1876, when it merged with its southern neighbor.

The name Mie supposedly was taken from a comment about the region made by [[Yamato Takeru]] on his way back from conquering the eastern regions.

In 1959, many people died as parts of Mie were devastated by the [[Typhoon Vera (1959)|Ise-wan Typhoon]], the strongest typhoon to hit Japan in recorded history. Crops were destroyed, sea walls ruined, roads and railways damaged and a substantial number of people were injured or left homeless.

In May 2016, the city of [[Shima, Mie|Shima]] hosted the [[42nd G7 summit]], the third summit without the presence of [[Russia]].

== Geography ==
[[File:Mie géolocalisation relief.svg|thumb|250px|Physical map of Mie prefecture]]
[[File:気象庁の三重県の区分.jpg|thumb|Regional division of Mie as used by the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]]: The primary division is between North/Central and South, the former being further subdivided into North, Central and Iga, the latter into Ise-Shima and KiSei/East Kishū; [[Ise Province|Ise/Sei-shū]], [[Shima Province|Shima/Shi-shū]], [[Iga Province|Iga/I-shū]] and [[Kii Province|Kii/Ki-shū]] are the four Ritsuryō provinces that are partly or entirely part of modern Mie.]]

Mie Prefecture forms the eastern part of the [[Kii Peninsula]], and borders on [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]], [[Gifu Prefecture|Gifu]], [[Shiga Prefecture|Shiga]], [[Kyoto Prefecture|Kyoto]], [[Nara Prefecture|Nara]], and [[Wakayama Prefecture|Wakayama]]. It is considered{{by whom|date=February 2013}} part of the [[Kansai]] and [[Tōkai region|Tōkai]] regions due to its geographical proximity to [[Aichi Prefecture]] and its cultural influence from [[Kansai]], such as the fact that [[Kansai dialect]] is spoken in Mie. Traditionally, though, the [[Iga, Mie|Iga]] region of Mie is considered to have always been a part of [[Kansai]].

Mie Prefecture measures {{convert|170|km|0|abbr=on}} from north to south, and {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=on}} from east to west, and includes five distinct geographical areas:<ref name="pref.mie.jp">{{Cite web |url=http://www.pref.mie.jp/ENGLISH/overview/e_p04_05.pdf |title=Mie Prefecture homepage: Mie's Geography and Climate (pdf) |access-date=2008-04-10 |archive-date=2008-05-20 |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080520220049/http%3A//www.pref.mie.jp/ENGLISH/overview/e_p04_05.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

# the north-west of Mie consists of the Suzuka Mountains
# along the coast of [[Ise Bay]] from the [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]] border to [[Ise, Mie|Ise City]] lies the Ise Plain, where most of the population of Mie live
# south of the Ise Plain is the [[Shima, Mie|Shima Peninsula]]
# bordering [[Nara Prefecture|Nara]] in the central-west is the [[Iga, Mie|Iga Basin]]
# running from central Mie to its southern borders is the Nunobiki Mountainous Region.

Mie has a coastline that stretches {{convert|1094.9|km|abbr=on}} and, as of 2000, Mie's {{convert|5776.44|km2|abbr=on}} landmass is 64.8 percent [[forest]], 11.5 percent [[agriculture]], 6 percent residential area, 3.8 percent [[road]]s, and 3.6 percent [[river]]s. The remaining 10.3 percent are not classified.

The Ise Plain has a relatively moderate climate, averaging {{convert|14|to|15|C}} for the year. The Iga Basin has more daily temperature variance and averages temperatures 1 to 2 degrees cooler than the Ise Plain. Southern Mie, south of the [[Shima Peninsula]], has a warmer [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] marine climate, with [[Owase, Mie|Owase Region]] having one of the heaviest rainfall figures for all of Japan.<ref name="pref.mie.jp"/>

=== Mergers ===
{{main|List of mergers in Mie Prefecture}}

When the modern municipalities were introduced in 1889, Mie initially consisted of 336 municipalities: 1 [[Cities of Japan|(by definition: district-level) city]] and 21 [[Districts of Japan|districts]] with 18 [[Towns of Japan|towns]] and 317 [[Villages of Japan|villages]]. With the Great Shōwa mergers of the 1950s, the number of municipalities in Mie had dropped to 88 by 1956. The Great Heisei mergers of the 2000s reduced the total from 69 to 29 between 2000 and 2006.

== Economy ==
Mie Prefecture has traditionally been a link between east and west Japan, thanks largely to the Tokaido and Ise Pilgrimage Roads. Traditional handicrafts such as Iga Braid, Yokkaichi Banko Pottery, Suzuka Ink, Iga Pottery and [[Katazome|Ise Katagami]] flourished. With 65% of the prefecture consisting of forests and with over {{convert|1000|km|-2|abbr=on}} of coastline, Mie has a long been associated with forestry and seafood industries. Mie also produces [[Green tea|tea]], [[Matsusaka beef|beef]], [[cultured pearl]]s and fruit, mainly [[mandarin orange]]s. Food production companies include [[Azuma Foods]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.azumafoods.co.jp/en/company/index.html |title=Azuma Foods Co., Ltd.｜Company Profile |publisher=Azumafoods.co.jp |access-date=2012-07-13 |archive-date=2012-09-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901161604/http://www.azumafoods.co.jp/en/company/index.html |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/13/garden/from-japan-a-big-wave-of-seaweed.html | work=The New York Times | first=Suzanne | last=Hamlin | title=From Japan, A Big Wave Of Seaweed | date=13 August 1997}}</ref>

Northern Mie is home to a number of manufacturing industries, mainly transport machinery manufacturing (vehicles and ships) and heavy chemical industries such as oil refineries. As well as this, Mie Prefecture is expanding into more advanced industries including the manufacture of semiconductors and liquid crystal displays. In [[Suzuka, Mie|Suzuka]], the [[Honda Motor Company]] maintains a factory established in 1960 that built the [[Honda Civic]], as well as other vehicles.

== Government and politics ==
[[File:Meiji Mura 3882282918 fc4d16685b.jpg|thumb|The Meiji-era, former (1879–1964) building of the Mie prefectural government has been reconstructed in the [[Meiji-mura|"Meiji village"]] museum in Aichi.]]
The [[Mie Prefectural Government|prefectural government]] was briefly moved to [[Yokkaichi, Mie|Yokkaichi Town]] in [[Mie District, Ise|Mie District]] in 1872 (hence the name Mie), but the capital moved back to Anotsu, [[Anō District, Ise|Anō District]] (present-day Tsu City) in 1873<ref>Prefectural government: [https://www.bunka.pref.mie.lg.jp/rekishi/kenshi/asp/meiji/detail.asp?record=483 三重県庁舎（津市下部田）] ("Mie prefectural government building (Tsu City, Lower Heta)"), retrieved June 24, 2020.</ref> and has remained there since. Ignoring small changes through cross-prefectural municipal mergers, neighbourhood transfers and coastline variations, Mie reached its present borders in 1876 when it absorbed [[Watarai Prefecture]]. After the modern reactivation of [[Districts of Japan|districts]] in 1878/79, Mie consisted of 21 districts (merged down to 15 in the 1890s).<ref>[http://www.tt.rim.or.jp/~ishato/tiri/gun/map/1889/24mie.htm Map of Mie's districts in January 1889, i.e. before the introduction of cities], [http://www.tt.rim.or.jp/~ishato/tiri/gun/map/1900/24mie.htm Map of Mie's two cities and 15 districts in 1900]</ref> The first prefectural assembly was elected in March 1879 and convened in April.<ref>Prefectural assembly: [http://www.pref.mie.lg.jp/KENGIKAI/07663011795.htm history/chronology since 1878] (Japanese), retrieved June 24, 2020.</ref> In the introduction of modern [[Municipalities of Japan|cities, towns and villages]] in 1889, Anotsu became district-independent as Tsu [[Cities of Japan|City]] and the districts were subdivided into 18 [[Towns of Japan|towns]] and 317 [[Villages of Japan|villages]] (see the [[List of mergers in Mie Prefecture]] for changes since then).

As in all prefectures except Okinawa, the governor of Mie is directly elected since 1947. The [[Mie Prefectural Assembly|prefectural assembly]] has 51 members. Both prefectural elections in Mie are currently held as part of unified local elections. In the last round in 2019, governor [[Eikei Suzuki]] easily won a third term with broad support from [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|LDP]], ''Shinsei Mie'' (see below) and [[Kōmeitō]], against only one, [[Japanese Communist Party|JCP]]-supported challenger;<ref>[[NHK]]SenkyoWeb: [https://www.nhk.or.jp/senkyo/database/touitsu/2019/24/14218/skh45054.html 2019 unified election results/prefectural governors/Mie], retrieved June 24, 2020.</ref> Suzuki was originally [[2011 Japanese unified local elections|elected narrowly in 2011]] as centre-right candidate against centre-left supported Naohisa Matsuda, former mayor of Tsu City. In the Mie assembly, the LDP is strongest party;<ref>[[NHK]]SenkyoWeb: [https://www.nhk.or.jp/senkyo/database/touitsu/2019/24/14219/jyo14219.html 2019 unified election results/prefectural assemblies/Mie] [by nomination in that election, not by party membership, let alone parliamentary group membership, or affiliations at any previous or later point in time] (Japanese), retrieved June 24, 2020.</ref> but it is distributed across several parliamentary groups, and the strongest group is ''Shisei Mie'' (新政みえ; "Renewal Mie") around members of several local parties of former [[Democratic Party of Japan|Democrats]].<ref>Prefectural assembly: [http://www.pref.mie.lg.jp/KENGIKAI/89264000001.htm Members by parliamentary group] (Japanese), retrieved June 24, 2020.</ref>

In the [[National Diet]], Mie is represented by four directly elected members of the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] and two (one per class) in the [[House of Councillors (Japan)|House of Councillors]]. After the national elections of 2016, 2017 and 2019, Mie's directly elected delegation was evenly split between Liberal Democrats (HR district #1: [[Norihisa Tamura]], #4: [[Noriyo Mitsuya]], HC 2019–25 class: [[Yūmi Yoshikawa]]) and ex-Democrats (HR #2: [[Masaharu Nakagawa (House of Representatives)|Masaharu Nakagawa]], #3: [[Katsuya Okada]], HC 2016–22 class: [[Hirokazu Shiba]]) in both houses of the Diet.
