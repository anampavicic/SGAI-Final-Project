As of 2022, it was the largest city in the State of Palestine, with 590,481 inhabitants in 2017. The city is spread across an area of {{Convert|45|km2|sqmi}}. Gaza is one of the principal coastal cities in the country, home to [[Port of Gaza|Palestine's only port]]. Located some {{Convert|76.6|km|mi}} southwest of the country's proclaimed capital [[East Jerusalem]], the city is located on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Prior to the [[2023 Israel–Hamas war]], it was the most populous city in the [[State of Palestine]], when massive displacement happened during the war.

Inhabited since at least the 15th century BC,<ref name = DicHistPl>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Gaza (Gaza Strip) | encyclopedia = International Dictionary of Historic Places |volume=4 |pages= 87–290 |publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers |year=1996}}</ref> Gaza has been dominated by different peoples and empires throughout its history. The [[Philistines]] made it a part of their [[Philistia|pentapolis]] after the [[ancient Egypt]]ians had ruled it for nearly 350 years. Under the [[Roman Empire]], Gaza experienced relative peace and its [[Port of Gaza|Mediterranean port]] flourished. In 635 AD, it became the first city in the [[Palestine (region)|Palestine region]] to be conquered by the [[Rashidun army]] and quickly developed into a centre of [[Fiqh|Islamic law]]. However, by the time the [[Crusader states]] were established in 1099, Gaza was in ruins. In later centuries, Gaza experienced several hardships—from [[Mongol raids into Palestine|Mongol raids]] to severe flooding and [[Locust swarm|locust swarms]], reducing it to a village by the 16th century, when it was incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]]. During the first half of Ottoman rule, the [[Ridwan dynasty]] controlled Gaza and the city went through an age of great commerce and peace. The municipality of Gaza was established in 1893.

Gaza fell to British forces during [[World War I]], becoming a [[Gaza Subdistrict, Mandatory Palestine|part]] of [[Mandatory Palestine]]. As a result of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], Egypt administered the newly formed Gaza Strip territory and several improvements were undertaken in the city. Gaza was [[Israeli occupied territories|occupied]] by [[Israel]] in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, and in 1993, the city was transferred to the newly created [[Palestinian National Authority]]. In the months following the 2006 election, an [[Fatah-Hamas conflict|armed conflict]] broke out between the Palestinian political factions of [[Fatah]] and [[Hamas]], resulting in the latter [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|taking power in Gaza]]. The Gaza Strip was then subject to an Israeli-led, Egyptian-supported [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip|blockade]].<ref name="IBRAHIM BARZAK 07/ 5/11 08:34 AM ET" /> Israel eased the blockade allowing consumer goods in June 2010, and Egypt reopened the [[Rafah Border Crossing]] in 2011 to pedestrians.<ref name="IBRAHIM BARZAK 07/ 5/11 08:34 AM ET">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/05/gaza-economy-benefits-fro_n_890181.html Gaza Benefiting From Israel Easing Economic Blockade]</ref><ref name="IBRAHIM BARZAK 06/21/11 08:13 AM ET">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/21/gaza-border-opening-bring_n_881127.html Gaza Border Opening Brings Little Relief]</ref>

The primary economic activities of Gaza are small-scale industries and agriculture. However, the [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip|blockade]] and recurring conflicts have put the economy under severe pressure.<ref name="Oxfam" /> The majority of Gaza's Palestinian inhabitants are [[Muslim]], although there is also a [[Palestinian Christians|Christian minority]]. Gaza has a very young population, with roughly 75% under the age of 25. The city is currently ''de facto'' administered by a 14-member municipal council controlled by Hamas.

As of {{currentmonth}} {{currentyear}}, as part of the [[2023 Israel–Hamas war|Israel–Hamas war]], the Israeli army has bombed large portions of the city and surrounding areas of the Northern Gaza Strip, destroying many buildings and infrastructure. Almost all residents have fled or been evacuated to Southern Gaza, or killed as a result. Therefore, previous recorded or estimated population numbers have become outdated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/article/palestinians-gaza-israel-bombing-destruction-hamas-reconstruction-f299a28410b70ee05dd764df97d8d3a0|title=Gaza has become a moonscape in war.

==Etymology==

The name ''Gaza'' first appears in military records of [[Thutmose III]] of [[New Kingdom (Egypt)|Egypt]] in the 15th century BC.<ref>{{cite journal |author= H. Jacob Katzenstein |title= Gaza in the Egyptian Texts of the New Kingdom |journal= Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume= 102 |issue= 1 |year= 1982 |pages= 111–113 |doi= 10.2307/601117|jstor= 601117  | issn = 0003-0279 }}</ref> In [[Neo-Assyrian]] sources, reflecting the late [[Philistine]] period, it was known as ''Hāzat''.<ref>Seymour Gitin, 'Philistines in the Book of Kings,' in [[André Lemaire]], Baruch Halpern, Matthew Joel Adams (eds.)[https://books.google.com/books?id=1SXbIFYu-ZAC&pg=PA312 ''The Books of Kings: Sources, Composition, Historiography and Reception,''] BRILL, 2010 pp.301–363, for the Neo-Assyrian sources p.312: The four city-states of the late Philistine period (Iron Age II) are ''Amqarrūna'' ([[Ekron]]), ''Asdūdu'' ([[Ashdod]]), ''Hāzat'' ([[Gaza City|Gaza]]), and ''Isqalūna'' ([[Ascalon]]), with the former fifth capital, [[Gath (city)|Gath]], having been abandoned at this late phase.</ref>

In [[Semitic languages]], the meaning of the city name is "fierce, strong".<ref name="Masalha"/> The Hebrew name of the city is ''ʿAzza'' (עַזָּה); the [[ayin]] at the beginning of the word represented a [[voiced pharyngeal fricative]] in [[Biblical Hebrew]] but is [[silent letter | silent]] in [[Modern Hebrew]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Blau |first1=Joshua |title=Phonology and morphology of Biblical Hebrew: an introduction |date=2010 |publisher=Eisenbrauns |location=Winona Lake (Ind.) |isbn=9781575061290 |pages=69}}</ref><ref name="Masalha">{{cite book |last1=Masalha |first1=Nur |author-link1=Nur Masalha |title=Palestine: A Four Thousand Year History |date=2018 |publisher=Zed Books Ltd. |isbn=9781786992758 |page=81 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cb2rDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT81}}</ref>

According to Shahin, the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians called it ''gḏt'' "Ghazzat" ("prized city"), and the Muslims often referred to it as ''Ghazzat Hashem'' in honor of [[Hashim ibn Abd Manaf|Hashim]], the great-grandfather of [[Muhammad]] who, according to [[Islamic mythology|Islamic tradition]], is buried in the city.<ref name=Shahinp414>Shahin, 2005, p. 414.</ref>

Other proper [[Arabic transliteration]]s for the Arabic name are ''{{transliteration|ar|ALA|Ghazzah}}'' or ''Ġazzah'' ([[DIN 31635]]). Accordingly, "Gaza" might be spelled "Gazza" in English.

===Bronze Age===
Settlement in the region of Gaza dates back to the [[ancient Egyptian]] fortress built in [[Canaan]]ite territory at [[Tell es-Sakan]], to the south of present-day Gaza. The site went into decline throughout the [[Early Bronze Age II]] as its trade with Egypt sharply decreased.<ref name="Filfil">{{cite web|url=http://www.thisweekinpalestine.com/details.php?id=2564&ed=157&edid=157|title=The Other Face of Gaza: The Gaza Continuum|first1=Rania|last1=Filfil|first2=Barbara|last2=Louton|work=This Week in Palestine|date=September 2008|access-date=2009-01-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207121431/http://www.thisweekinpalestine.com/details.php?id=2564&ed=157&edid=157|archive-date=2009-02-07|url-status=dead}}</ref> Another urban center known as [[Tell el-Ajjul]] began to grow along the Wadi Ghazza riverbed. During the [[Middle Bronze Age]], a revived Tell es-Sakan became the southernmost locality in Palestine, serving as a fort. In 1650 BC, when the Canaanite [[Hyksos]] occupied Egypt, a second city developed on the ruins of the first Tell as-Sakan. However, it was abandoned by the 14th century BC, at the end of the Bronze Age.<ref name="Filfil" />

During the reign of [[Tuthmosis III]] (r. 1479–1425 BC), the city became a stop on the Syrian-Egyptian [[caravan route]] and was mentioned in the 14th-century [[Amarna letters]] as "Azzati".<ref name="STF-J"/> Gaza later served as Egypt's administrative capital in [[Canaan]].<ref>Michael G.

===Iron Age and the Hebrew Bible===
In the 12th century BC Gaza became part of the [[Philistia|Philistine "pentapolis"]].<ref name="STF-J"/>

According to the [[Hebrew Bible]]'s [[Book of Judges]], Gaza was the place where [[Samson]] was imprisoned by the [[Philistines]] and met his death ({{bibleverse|Judges|16:21}}).

===Israelite to Persian periods===
After being ruled by the [[Israelite]]s, [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]], and then the Egyptians, Gaza achieved relative independence and prosperity under the [[Persian Empire]].

===Hellenistic period ===

[[Alexander the Great]] [[Siege of Gaza (332 BCE)|besieged Gaza]], the last city to resist his conquest on his path to Egypt, for five months before finally capturing it 332 BC;<ref name="STF-J"/> the inhabitants were either killed or taken captive. Alexander brought in local Bedouins to populate Gaza and organized the city into a ''[[polis]]'' (or "[[city-state]]").

In [[Seleucid]] times, [[Seleucus I Nicator]], or one of his successors renamed Gaza into '''Seleucia''' to control the surrounding area against the Ptolemies.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} [[Greek culture]] consequently took root and Gaza earned a reputation as a flourishing center of [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] learning and philosophy.<ref name="Ring and Salkin">Ring and Salkin, 1994, p.287.</ref> During the [[Third War of the Diadochi]], [[Ptolemy I Soter]] defeated [[Demetrius I of Macedon]] in [[Battle of Gaza (312 BC)|a battle]] near Gaza in 312 BC. In 277 BC, following [[Ptolemy II]]'s successful campaign against the [[Nabataeans]] the Ptolemaic fortress of Gaza took control of the spice trade with [[Gerrha]] and [[South Arabia|Southern Arabia]].

Gaza experienced another siege in 96 BC by the [[Hasmonean]] king [[Alexander Jannaeus]] who "utterly overthrew" the city, killing 500 senators who had fled into the temple of [[Apollo]] for safety.<ref name=Pataip149>Patai, 1999, p. 149.</ref>

[[File:Umm ar-Rasas mosaic Gaza.png|thumb|right|Depiction of a Gaza building in the Byzantine [[Umm ar-Rasas mosaics]], circa 8th century AD during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]]]

In {{circa|638}} Gaza was captured by [[Rashidun Caliphate|Arab Muslim]] forces under [[Amr ibn al-As]], in the years following the [[Battle of Ajnadayn]] between the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] in central Palestine.<ref>Kennedy, 2007, p. 88.</ref> It was captured by Amr's forces about three years later.

The arrival of the Muslim Arabs brought significant changes to Gaza; at first some of its [[Church Building|churches]] were transformed into [[mosques]], including the present [[Great Mosque of Gaza]] (the oldest in the city), which was later rebuilt by Sultan [[Baibars]], who endowed it with a huge manuscript library containing over 20,000 [[manuscript]]s in the 13th century.<ref name="Filiu18-19" /> A large segment of the population swiftly adopted Islam,<ref name="Filiu23">Filiu, 2014, pp. 23.</ref><ref name="Ring and Salkin2">Ring and Salkin, 1994, p. 289.</ref> and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] became the official language.<ref name="Ring and Salkin2" /> In 767 [[Al-Shafi'i|Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i]] was born in Gaza and lived his early childhood there; he founded the [[Shafi'i]] religious code, one of the four major [[Sunni Muslim]] schools of law (''[[fiqh]]'').<ref name="Gil">Gil, 1992, p.292.</ref> Security, which was well-maintained during early Muslim rule, was the key to Gaza's prosperity.

===Crusader and Ayyubid periods===
The [[First Crusade|Crusaders]] conquered Gaza in 1100 and King [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]] built a castle in the city for the [[Knights Templar]] in 1149.<ref name="Pringle" /> He also had the Great Mosque converted back into a church, the Cathedral of Saint John.<ref name="mah" /> In 1154, Arab traveller [[al-Idrisi]] wrote that Gaza "is today very populous and in the hands of the Crusaders."<ref>[[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] quoted in le Strange, 1890, p. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/442/mode/1up 442]</ref> In 1187 the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubids]], led by Sultan [[Saladin]], captured Gaza and in 1191 destroyed the city's fortifications. [[Richard the Lionheart]] apparently refortified the city in 1192, but the walls were dismantled again as a result of the [[Treaty of Ramla]] agreed upon months later in 1193.<ref name="Pringle" /> Ayyubid rule ended in 1260, after the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] under [[Hulagu Khan]] completely destroyed Gaza, which became his southernmost conquest.<ref name="Ring and Salkin2" />

===Mamluk period===
Following Gaza's destruction by the Mongols, Muslim slave-soldiers based in Egypt known as the [[Bahri dynasty|Mamluks]] began to administer the area. In 1277, the Mamluks made Gaza the capital of a province that bore its name, ''Mamlakat Ghazzah'' (Governorship of Gaza). This district extended along the coastal plain of Palestine from [[Rafah]] in the south to just north of [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]], and to the east as far as the [[Samaria]]n highlands and the [[Hebron Hills]]. Other major towns in the province included [[Qaqun]], [[Lod|Ludd]], and [[Ramla]].<ref name="Ring and Salkin2" /><ref name="Sharon">Sharon, 1997, pp.XII-XIII.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=June 2024}} Gaza, which entered a period of tranquility under the Mamluks, was used by them as an outpost in their offensives against the Crusaders which ended in 1290.<ref>Sharon, 2009, p.

The Mamluks allowed Jews to return to the city, after being expelled by the Crusaders, and the Jewish community prospered during Mamluk rule. Towards the end of the Mamluk period, the Jewish community in Gaza was the third largest in Palestine, after the communities in Safad and Jerusalem.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} In 1481, an Italian Jewish traveller, [[Meshulam of Volterra]], wrote of Gaza:<blockquote>It is a fine and renowned place, and its fruits are very renowned and good. Bread and good wine is to be found there, but only Jews make wine. Gaza has a circumference of four miles and no walls. It is about six miles from the sea and situated in a valley and on a hill. It has a population as numerous as the sands of the sea, and there are about fifty (sixty) Jewish householders, artisans. They have a small but pretty Synagogue, and [[vineyard]]s and fields and houses. They had already begun to make the new wine. ... The Jews live at the top of the hill. May God exalt them. There are also four [[Samaritan]] householders who live on the hillside.<ref>{{cite book | author = Elkan Nathan Adler | title = Jewish Travellers in the Middle Ages | url = https://archive.org/details/jewishtravellers00elka | url-access = registration | publisher = Dover | year = 1987 |orig-year= 1930 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/jewishtravellers00elka/page/180 180–181]| isbn = 9780486253978 }}</ref></blockquote>

===Ottoman period===

In 1516 Gaza—at the time, a small town with an inactive port, ruined buildings and reduced trade—was incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref name="Ring and Salkin3" /> The Ottoman army quickly and efficiently crushed a small-scale uprising,<ref>Ze'evi, 1996, p.2.</ref> and the local population generally welcomed them as fellow Sunni Muslims.<ref name="Ring and Salkin3" /> The city was then made the capital of the [[Sanjak of Gaza|Gaza Sanjak]], part of the larger [[Ottoman Syria|Province of Damascus]].<ref>Doumani, 1995, p.35.</ref> The [[Ridwan dynasty|Ridwan family]], named after governor Ridwan Pasha, was the first dynasty to govern Gaza and would continue to rule the city for over a century.<ref name="Ze'evi">Ze'evi, 1996, p.40.</ref> Under [[Ahmad ibn Ridwan]], the city became a cultural and religious center as a result of the partnership between the governor and prominent Islamic jurist [[Khayr al-Din al-Ramli]], who was based in the nearby town of al-[[Ramla]].<ref>Ze'evi, 1996, p.53.</ref>

According to [[Theodore Edward Dowling|Theodore E. Dowling]] writing in 1913, a [[Samaritan]] community existed in Gaza in 1584. They possessed a large [[Synagogue#Samaritan synagogues|synagogue]] and two bathhouses. "One of them still bears the name "[[Hamam al-Sammara|the Bath of the Samaritans]]." It is believed the Samaritans were expelled from the city before the turn of the 16th century.<ref>Dowling, 1913, pp.38-39.</ref> 

During the rule of [[Husayn Pasha]], strife between the settled population and the nearby [[Bedouin]] tribes was dramatically reduced, allowing Gaza to peacefully prosper. The Ridwan period is described as a [[golden age]] for Gaza, a time when it served as the virtual "capital of Palestine."<ref>Dowling, 1913, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/gazacityofmanyba00dowlrich#page/70/mode/1up 70]-71</ref><ref>Meyer, 1907, p. [https://archive.org/stream/historyofcityofg00meyeuoft#page/98/mode/1up 98]</ref> The Great Mosque was restored, and six other mosques constructed, while [[Turkish bath]]s and market stalls proliferated.<ref name="Ring and Salkin3" /> After the death of [[Musa Pasha ibn Hasan Ridwan|Musa Pasha]], Husayn's successor, Ottoman officials were appointed to govern in place of the Ridwans. The Ridwan period was Gaza's last golden age during Ottoman rule. After the family was removed from office, the city gradually declined.<ref name="Ze'evi2">Ze'evi, 1996, p.41.</ref>

Starting in the early 19th century, Gaza was culturally dominated by neighboring Egypt; [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] conquered Gaza in 1832.<ref name="mah" /> American scholar [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]] visited the city in 1838, describing it as a "thickly populated" town larger than Jerusalem, with its Old City lying upon a hilltop, while its suburbs laid on the nearby plain.<ref name="Robinson1">Robinson, 1841, vol 2, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/biblicalresearc00smitgoog#page/n396/mode/1up 374]-375</ref> The city benefited from trade and commerce because of its strategic position on the caravan route between Egypt and northern Syria as well as from producing soap and cotton for trade with the government, local Arab tribes, and the Bedouin of [[Wadi Arabah]] and [[Ma'an]].<ref name="Robinson2">Robinson, 1841, vol 2, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/biblicalresearc00smitgoog#page/n399/mode/1up 377–378]</ref> The [[bazaar]]s of Gaza were well-supplied and were noted by Robinson as "far better" than those of Jerusalem.<ref>Robinson, 1841, vol 2, p. [https://archive.org/stream/biblicalresearc00smitgoog#page/n400/mode/1up 378]</ref> Robinson noted that virtually all of Gaza's vestiges of ancient history and antiquity had disappeared due to constant conflict and occupation.<ref>Robinson, 1841, p.38.</ref> By the mid-19th century, Gaza's port was eclipsed by the ports of Jaffa and [[Haifa]], but it retained its fishing fleet.<ref name="Abu-Lughod" />

The bubonic plague struck Gaza again in 1839 and the city, lacking political and economic stability, went into a state of stagnation. In 1840 Egyptian and Ottoman troops battled outside of Gaza. The Ottomans won control of the territory, effectively ending Egyptian rule over Palestine. However, the battles brought about more death and destruction in Gaza whilst the city was still recovering from the effects of the plague.<ref name="Ring and Salkin3" />

During the late Ottoman period, British ships docking in Gaza were loaded with [[barley]], which was primarily intended for marketing in [[Scotland]] for [[Scotch whisky|whisky]] production. Due to the absence of a British consular agent, precise data on the financial value and quantities of the goods are unavailable.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Grossman |first=David |title=Arab Demography and Early Jewish Settlement in Palestine: Distribution and Population Density during the Late Ottoman and Early Mandate Periods |publisher=The Hebrew University Magness Press, Jerusalem |year=2004 |isbn=978-965-493-184-7 |location=Jerusalem |pages=8 |language=he}}</ref>

===Stages of conflict and occupation===
[[File:Gaza after WWI 2.jpg|thumb|Gaza after surrender to British forces, 1918|left]]
While leading the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Forces]] during World War I, the British won control of the city during the [[Third Battle of Gaza]] in 1917.<ref name="Ring and Salkin3" /> After the war, Gaza was included in Mandatory Palestine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merip.org/palestine-israel_primer/brit-mandate-pal-isr-prime.html|title=Palestine, Israel and the Arab-Israeli Conflict A Primer|access-date=2009-01-19|publisher=Middle East Research Information Project|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122095032/http://merip.org/palestine-israel_primer/brit-mandate-pal-isr-prime.html|archive-date=2009-01-22|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the 1930s and 1940s, Gaza underwent major expansion. New neighborhoods were built along the coast and the southern and eastern plains. International organizations and missionary groups funded most of this construction.<ref name="Abu-Lughod">Dumper and Abu-Lughod, 2007, p.155.</ref>

In the 1947 [[United Nations Partition Plan]], Gaza was assigned to be part of an Arab state in Palestine but was [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|occupied by Egypt]] following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Gaza's growing population was augmented by an influx of refugees fleeing or expelled from nearby cities, towns and villages that were captured by Israel. In 1957, Egyptian president [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] made a number of reforms in Gaza, which included expanding educational opportunities and the civil services, providing housing, and establishing local security forces.<ref name="Feldman">Feldman, 2008, pp.8–9.</ref>

Gaza was occupied by Israel during the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] following the defeat of the [[Egyptian Army]]. Frequent conflicts have erupted between Palestinians and the Israeli authorities in the city since the 1970s. The tensions led to the [[First Intifada]] in 1987. Gaza was a center of confrontation during this uprising,<ref name="Ring and Salkin3" /> and economic conditions in the city worsened.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.palestinechronicle.com/sara-roy-the-gaza-economy/ |author-link=Sara Roy|title=The Economy of Gaza |access-date=2009-01-19 |last=Roy |first=Sara |date=4 October 2006|publisher=Palestine Information Center }}</ref>

[[File:WMC Gaza City.jpg|thumb|Gaza City in 2006|left]]
In September 1993, the leaders of Israel and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) signed the [[Oslo Accords]]. The agreement called for Palestinian administration of the Gaza Strip and the [[West Bank]] town of [[Jericho]], which was implemented in May 1994. Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza, leaving a new [[Palestinian National Authority]] (PNA) to administer and police the city.<ref name="Ring and Salkin" /> The PNA, led by [[Yasser Arafat]], chose Gaza as its first provincial headquarters. The newly established [[Palestinian National Council]] held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996.<ref name="Abu-Lughod" />

In 2005, Israel withdrew its troops from the Gaza Strip and removed the thousands of Israelis who had settled in the territory.<ref name="BBCProfile" /> (''See'' [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan of 2004]].) Since the Israeli withdrawal, [[Hamas]] has been engaged in a sometimes violent power struggle with its rival Palestinian organisation [[Fatah]]. On January 25, 2006, [[Hamas]] won a surprise victory in the [[2006 Palestinian legislative election|elections]] for the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]], the legislature of the [[Palestinian National Authority]]. In 2007, [[Fatah–Hamas battle in Gaza|Hamas overthrew Fatah forces]] in the Gaza Strip and Hamas members were dismissed from the PNA government in the West Bank in response. Currently, Hamas, recognized as a terror organization by most western countries, has ''de facto'' control of the city and Strip.<ref name="BBC07">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6754499.stm |title=Abbas sacks Hamas-led government |access-date=2009-01-19 |date=2007-07-15 |work=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>

A prominent hill southeast of Gaza, known as Tell al-Muntar, has an elevation of {{convert|270|ft|m}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. For centuries it has been claimed as the place to which [[Samson]] brought the city gates of the Philistines. The hill is crowned by a Muslim [[shrine]] (''[[Maqam (shrine)|maqam]]'') dedicated to Ali al-Muntar ("Ali of the Watchtower"). There are old Muslim graves around the surrounding trees,<ref name="Briggs1">Briggs, 1918, p.258.</ref> and the lintel of the doorway of the ''maqam'' has two medieval Arabic scriptures.<ref name="STF-J" />

=== Old City ===
{{main|Old City of Gaza}}
The Old City forms the main part of Gaza's nucleus. It is roughly divided into two quarters; the northern [[al-Daraj|Daraj Quarter]] (also known as the Muslim Quarter) and the southern [[al-Zaytun|Zaytun Quarter]] (which contained the Jewish and Christian quarters.) Most structures date from the Mamluk and Ottoman eras, and some were built on top of earlier structures. The ancient part of the Old City is about {{convert|1.6|km2|sqmi}}.<ref name="Abu-Lughod" />

There were seven historic gates to the Old City: Bab Asqalan (Gate of Ascalon), Bab al-Darum (Gate of Deir al-Balah), Bab al-Bahr (Gate of the Sea), Bab Marnas (Gate of Marnas), Bab al-Baladiyah (Gate of the Town), Bab al-Khalil (Gate of Hebron), and Bab al-Muntar (Gate of Tell al-Muntar).<ref>Pringle, 1993, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BgQ6AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA209 209]</ref>

Some of the older buildings in Gaza's Old City use the ''[[ablaq]]'' style of decoration which features alternating layers of red and white masonry, prevalent in the Mamluk era. Daraj contains the [[Gold Market|Gold (Qissariya) Market]] as well as the [[Great Mosque of Gaza]] (oldest mosque in Gaza)<ref name="Sheehan">Sheehan, 2000, p. 429.</ref> and the [[Sayed al-Hashim Mosque]].<ref name="Sharon31">Sharon, 2009, p.

According to Ottoman tax records in 1557, Gaza had 2,477 male taxpayers.<ref name="Cohen">Cohen and Lewis, 1978.</ref> The statistics from 1596 show that Gaza's Muslim population consisted of 456 households, 115 bachelors, 59 religious persons, and 19 disabled persons. In addition to the Muslim figure, there were 141 ''jundiyan'' or "soldiers" in the Ottoman army. Of the Christians, there were 294 households and seven bachelors, while there were 73 Jewish households and eight [[Samaritan]] households. In total, an estimated 6,000 people lived in Gaza, making it the third largest city in Ottoman Palestine after Jerusalem and [[Safad]].<ref name="Hut">Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p.52.</ref>

In 1838, there were roughly 4,000 Muslim and 100 Christian tax payers, implying a population of about 15,000 or 16,000—making it larger than Jerusalem at the time. The total number of Christian families was 57.<ref name="Robinson2" /> Before the outbreak of World War I, the population of Gaza had reached 42,000; however, the fierce battles between Allied Forces and the Ottomans and their German allies in 1917 in Gaza resulted in a massive population decrease.<ref name="IIPA" /> The following [[1922 census of Palestine|census]], which was conducted in 1922 by the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate authorities]] shows a sharp decrease in population which stood at 17,480 residents (16,722 Muslims, 701 Christians, 54 Jews and three [[Shia villages in Palestine|Metawilehs]]).<ref name="Report and General Abstracts of the census of 1922" /> The 1931 census lists 17,046 inhabitants (16,356 Muslims, 689 Christians, and one Jew) and another 4,597 in the suburbs (4,561 Muslims and 36 Christians).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mills |first=E. |title=Census of Palestine 1931 |publisher=Greek Convent & Goldberg Presses |year=1931 |location=Jerusalem |pages=3}}</ref>

A report by [[human rights and development]] groups published in 2008 stated that Gaza had suffered a long term pattern of economic stagnation and dire development indicators, the severity which was increased exponentially by the Israeli and Egyptian blockades.<ref name="Oxfam" /> The report cited a number of economic indicators to illustrate the point: In 2008, 95% of Gaza's industrial operations were suspended due to lack of access inputs for production and export problems. In 2009, unemployment in Gaza was close to 40%. The private sector which generates 53% of all jobs in Gaza was devastated and businesses went bankrupt. In June 2005, 3,900 factories in Gaza employed 35,000 people, by December 2007, only 1,700 were still employed. The construction industry was paralyzed with tens of thousands of laborers out of work. The agriculture sector was hard hit, affecting nearly 40,000 workers dependent on [[cash crop]]s.<ref name="Oxfam">{{cite web |url=http://mediciconafrica.altervista.org/newsletter/gaza.pdf |title=The Gaza Strip: A Humanitarian Implosion |access-date=2009-01-19 |publisher=[[Oxfam]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224105507/http://mediciconafrica.altervista.org/newsletter/gaza.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Gaza's [[food prices]] rose during the blockade, with wheat flour going up 34%, rice up 21%, and baby powder up 30%. In 2007, households spent an average of 62% of their total income on food, compared to 37% in 2004.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Palestinian cuisine#Gaza}}
Gaza's cuisine is characterized by its generous use of spices and chillies. Other major flavors and ingredients include dill, chard, garlic, cumin, lentils, chickpeas, pomegranates, sour plums and [[tamarind]]. Many of the traditional dishes rely on [[clay pot cooking]], which preserves the flavor and texture of the vegetables and results in fork-tender meat. Traditionally, most Gazan dishes are seasonal and rely on ingredients indigenous to the area and its surrounding villages. Poverty has also played an important role in determining many of the city's simple meatless dishes and stews, such as ''saliq wa adas'' ("chard and lentils") and ''bisara'' (skinless fava beans mashed with dried [[mulukhiya]] leaves and chilies).<ref name="Haddad">[[Laila el-Haddad|El-Haddad, Laila]].

Fish is either fried or grilled after being stuffed with cilantro, garlic, chillies and cumin, and marinated with various spices. It is also a key ingredient in ''sayyadiya'', rice cooked with caramelized onions, a generous amount of whole garlic cloves, large chunks of well-marinated fried fish, and spices such as turmeric, cinnamon, and cumin.<ref name="Haddad" /> Many of the 1948-era refugees were ''[[fellahin]]'' ("peasants") who ate seasonal foods. ''[[Sumaghiyyeh]]'', popular in Gaza not just on Ramadan but all year round, is a mixture of sumac, tahina and water combined with chard, chunks of beef and chickpeas. The dish is topped with crushed dill seeds, chillies and fried garlic and served in bowls.<ref name="Haddad" /> ''Maftool'' is a wheat-based dish flavored with dried sour plums that is served like couscous or shaped into little balls and steamed over stew or soup.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NTo6c_PJWRgC&q=gaza+levantine+food&pg=PA285|title=Food Cultures of the World Encyclopedia|first=Ken|last=Albala|date=1 January 2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313376269|access-date=28 April 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>

Throughout the Old City there are street stalls that sell cooked beans, hummus, roasted sweet potatoes, falafel, and kebabs. Coffee houses (''qahwa'') serve [[Arabic coffee]] and tea.

Alcohol is a rarity, found only in the United Nations Beach Club.<ref>Jacobs, 1994, p.456</ref>

=== Costumes and embroidery ===

[[File:Chest panel from Gaza dress (Palestinian Thobe).jpg|thumb|Chest panel from Gaza dress]]
[[Gauze]] is reputed to have originated in Gaza. Cloth for the Gaza ''thob'' was often woven at nearby [[al-Majdal, Askalan|Majdal]]. Black or blue cottons or striped pink and green fabric that had been made in Majdal continued to be woven throughout the [[Gaza Strip]] by refugees from the coastal plain villages until the 1960s. ''Thobs'' here had narrow, tight, straight sleeves. Embroidery was much less dense than that applied in Hebron. The most popular motifs included: scissors (''muqass''), combs (''mushut'') and triangles (''hijab'') often arranged in clusters of fives, sevens and threes, as the use of odd numbers is considered in Arab [[folklore]] to be effective against the [[evil eye]].<ref name="PCA2">{{cite web|title=Palestine costume before 1948: by region|publisher=Palestine Costume Archive|access-date=2008-08-01|url=http://www.palestinecostumearchive.org/regional.htm|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020913101705/http%3A//www%2Epalestinecostumearchive%2Eorg/regional%2Ehtm |archive-date= September 13, 2002 }}</ref> 

Circa 1990, [[Hamas]] and other Islamic movements sought to increase the use of the ''[[hijab]]'' ("headscarf") among Gazan women, especially urban and educated women, and the ''hijab'' styles since introduced have varied according to class and group identity.<ref name=Hammami>Rema Hammami.

According to the PCBS, in 1997, approximately over 90% of Gaza's population over the age of 10 was literate. Of the city's population, 140,848 were enrolled in schools (39.8% in elementary school, 33.8% in secondary school, and 26.4% in high school).

In January 2008, the [[United Nations Children's Fund]] reported that schools in Gaza had been canceling classes that were high on energy consumption, such as [[information technology]], science labs and extra curricular activities.<ref name="Oxfam" />

=== Universities ===
Gaza has many universities. The four main universities in the city are [[al-Azhar University – Gaza]], [[al-Quds Open University]], [[al-Aqsa University]] and the [[Islamic University of Gaza]]. The Islamic University, consisting of ten facilities, was founded by a group of businessmen in 1978, making it the first University in Gaza.

The Public Library of Gaza is located off [[Wehda Street]] and has a collection of nearly 10,000 books in Arabic, English and French. A total area of about {{convert|1410|m2}}, the building consists of two floors and a basement.

The library's primary objectives are to provide sources of information that meets the needs of beneficiaries, provide necessary facilities for access to available information sources, and organizing various cultural programs such as, cultural events, seminars, lectures, film presentations, videos, art and book exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://74.125.45.101/translate_c?hl=en&sl=ar&u=http://www.mogaza.org/centers-library.htm&prev=/search%3Fq%3DGaza%2BMunicipality%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26hs%3DE5j%26pwst%3D1&usg=ALkJrhjTkA9I7j9liOYc90GIppOKptX9cg|title=The municipal public library|publisher=Gaza Municipality}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

== Landmarks ==
[[File:-صورة من زاوية اخرى لقباب مسجد السيد هاشم.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sayed al-Hashim Mosque]] where the Islamic prophet [[Mohammed]]'s great-grandfather, [[Hashim ibn Abd Manaf]] (c. 464-497), is thought to be buried.]] 
[[File:Gaza War Cemetery 3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gaza War Cemetery|World War I Cemetery in Gaza]]]]

Landmarks in Gaza include the [[Great Mosque of Gaza|Great Mosque]] in the Old City. Originally a pagan temple, it was consecrated a Greek Orthodox church by the Byzantines,<ref>Jacobs, 1998, p.451</ref> then a mosque in the 8th century by the Arabs. The Crusaders transformed it into a church, but it was reestablished as a mosque soon after Gaza's reconquest by the Muslims.<ref name="Sheehan" /> It is the oldest and largest in the Gaza Strip.<ref>Porter and Murray, 1868, p.250.</ref>

Other mosques in the Old City include the Mamluk-era [[Mosque of al-Sayed Hashem|Sayed Hashem Mosque]] that believed to house the tomb of Hashem ibn Abd al-Manaf in its dome.<ref>[http://www.webgaza.net/gaza_strip/tour/Sayyed_Hashem_Mosque.htm Sayyed Hashem Mosque] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224122300/http://www.webgaza.net/gaza_strip/tour/Sayyed_Hashem_Mosque.htm |date=2008-12-24 }} Web Gaza.</ref> There is also the nearby [[Kateb al-Welaya Mosque]] that dates back to 1334. In [[Shuja'iyya]] is the [[Ibn Uthman Mosque]], which was built by Nablus native Ahmad ibn Uthman in 1402, and the [[Mahkamah Mosque]] built by Mamluk [[majordomo]] Birdibak al-Ashrafi in 1455. In [[Tuffah]] is the [[Ibn Marwan Mosque]],<ref name="Sharon31" /> which was built in 1324 and houses the tomb of Ali ibn Marwan, a holy man.<ref name="MET" />

The [[Unknown Soldier's Square]], located in [[Rimal]], is a monument dedicated to an unknown Palestinian fighter who died in the 1948 War. In 1967, the monument was torn down by Israeli forces and remained a patch of sand,<ref>Jacobs, 1998, p.455.</ref> until a public garden was built there with funding from Norway. [[Qasr al-Basha]], originally a Mamluk-era villa that was used by Napoleon during his brief sojourn in Gaza, is located in the Old City and is today a girls' school. The Commonwealth Gaza War Cemetery, often referred to as the British War Cemetery, contains the graves of fallen Allied soldiers in World War I; it sits {{convert|1.5|km|0|abbr=on}} northeast of the city center, in the Tuffah district, near [[Salah al-Din Road]].<ref name="Sheehan" /><ref>[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/71701 Gaza War Cemetery] at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission</ref>

=== Water supply and sanitation ===
According to the 1997 census by the [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]], 98.1% of Gaza's residents were connected to the public [[right to water|water supply]] while the remainder used a private system.<ref>[http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/gaz_t9.aspx Occupied Housing Units by Locality and Connection to Water Network] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119063118/http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/gaz_t9.aspx |date=2008-11-19 }} [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]] (PCBS).</ref> About 87.6% were connected to a public sewage system and 11.8% used a cesspit.<ref>[http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/gaz_t11.aspx Occupied Housing Units by Locality and Connection to Sewage System in Housing Unit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119063038/http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/gaz_t11.aspx |date=2008-11-19 }} [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]] (PCBS).</ref> The blockade on Gaza severely restricted the city's water supply. The six main wells for drinking water did not function, and roughly 50% of the population had no water on a regular basis. The municipality claimed it was forced to pump water through "salty wells" because of the unavailability of electricity. About 20&nbsp;million liters of raw sewage and 40&nbsp;million liters of partially treated water per day flowed into the Mediterranean Sea, and untreated sewage bred insects and mice.<ref>[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ar&u=http://www.mogaza.org/&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=1&ct=result&prev=/search%3Fq%3DGaza%2BMunicipality%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26hs%3DE5j%26pwst%3D1 The outcome of the unjust embargo on the work of the municipal] Gaza Municipality.</ref>
As a "water-poor" country, Gaza is highly dependent on water from [[Wadi Gaza|Wadi Ghazza]]. The Gaza Aquifer is used as Gaza's main resource for obtaining quality water. However, the majority of water from Wadi Ghazza is transported to Jerusalem.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Clive|last1=Lipchin|first2=Eric|last2=Pallant|first3=Danielle|last3=Saranga|first4=Allyson|last4=Amster|title=Integrated Water Resources Management and Security in the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7rgHmpppZ-wC&pg=PA109|year=2007|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-5986-5|page=109}}</ref>

=== Power grid ===
In 2002 Gaza began operating its own power plant which was built by [[Enron]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Published: March 09, 2002 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/09/business/enron-sought-to-raise-cash-two-years-ago.html?pagewanted=2&src=pm |title=Enron Sought To Raise Cash Two Years Ago – Page 2 – New York Times |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2002-03-09 |access-date=2013-03-26}}</ref> However, the power plant was bombed and destroyed by the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] in 2006.

=== Solid waste management ===
Solid waste management is one of key compelling issues facing Gazans today. These challenges are attributed to several factors; the lack of investment in environmental systems, less attention was given to environmental projects, and the absence of law enforcement and the tendency towards crisis management. One of the main aspects of this problem is the huge quantities of rubble and debris generated as a result of Israeli bombardments.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Salemdeeb|first1=Ramy|title=Gaza's Challenge|journal=CIWM|date=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://zerowastemena.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/gazas-challenge.html |title=Gaza's Challenge |publisher=CIWM journal |date=2013-04-25 |access-date=2015-04-18}}</ref>

For instance, the scale of damage resulting from the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict|Operation Protective Edge]] is unprecedented. All governorates in the Gaza Strip witnessed extensive aerial bombardment, naval shelling and artillery fire, resulting in a considerable amount of rubble. According to recent statistics, more than 2&nbsp;million tonnes of debris was generated. Approximately 10,000 houses were leveled to the ground including two 13-story residential buildings. A tremendous amount of debris remains scattered in Gaza. Serious efforts and a high budget are required to handle this challenge. More importantly, and based on a UNEP study after the 2008 war, the debris is highly likely to be contaminated with PAHs and probably with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and furan compounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gaza-toil-rubble-rami-salem?trk=prof-post |title=Gaza: Toil & Rubble |publisher=CIWM journal |date=2014-12-16 |access-date=2015-04-18}}</ref> In January 2024, the Israeli army destroyed Gaza City’s main reservoirs, Al-Balad and Al-Rimal.<ref>{{cite news |title=Lack of access to clean drinking water is a death sentence for the people of Gaza |url=https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/lack-access-clean-drinking-water-death-sentence-people-gaza-enar |work=[[ReliefWeb]] |date=15 January 2024}}</ref>

== Health care ==
[[File:Al-Quds hospital, Gaza City, following Israeli shelling.jpg|thumb|[[Al-Quds hospital]], Gaza City, following Israeli shelling in 2009]]
[[Al-Shifa Hospital]] ("the Cure") was founded in the Rimal District by the British Mandate government in the 1940s. Housed in an army barracks, it originally provided quarantine and treatment for [[febrile]] diseases. When Egypt administered Gaza, this original department was relocated and al-Shifa became the city's central hospital.<ref>Husseini and Barnea, 2002, p.135.</ref> When Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip after occupying it in the [[1956 Suez Crisis]], Egyptian president [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] had al-Shifa hospital expanded and improved. He also ordered the establishment of a second hospital in the Nasser District with the same name. In 1957, the quarantine and febrile disease hospital was rebuilt and named [[Nasser Hospital]].<ref name="Husseini" /> Today, al-Shifa remains Gaza's largest medical complex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dci-pal.org/english/display.cfm?DocId=526&CategoryId=23 |title=Al-Shifa Hospital and Israel's Gaza Siege |date=2006-07-16 |publisher=Defence For Children International, Palestine Section |access-date=2009-02-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021083834/http://www.dci-pal.org/english/display.cfm?DocId=526&CategoryId=23 |archive-date=2009-10-21 }}</ref>

Throughout the late 1950s, a new health administration, Bandar Gaza ("Gaza Region"), was established and headed by [[Haidar Abdel-Shafi]]. Bandar Gaza rented several rooms throughout the city to set up government clinics that provided essential [[curative care]].<ref name="Husseini">Husseini and Barnea, 2002, p.136.</ref>

In 2007, hospitals experienced power cuts lasting for 8–12 hours daily and diesel required for power generators was in short supply. According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), the proportion of patients given permits to exit Gaza for medical care decreased from 89.3% in January 2007 to 64.3% in December 2007.<ref name="Oxfam" />

In 2010, a team of doctors from Al-Durrah Hospital in Gaza spent a year of training at the cystic fibrosis clinic at [[Hadassah Medical Center]] in [[Jerusalem]]. Upon their return to Gaza, a cystic fibrosis center was established at Al-Durrah, although the most serious cases are referred to Hadassah.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/hadassah-at-100-where-no-man-has-gone-before/secret-medical-service.premium-1.469151|title=Secret medical service |work=[[Haaretz]]}}</ref>

The Rasheed Coastal Road runs along Gaza's coastline and connects it with the rest of Gaza Strip's coastline north and south. The main highway of the Gaza Strip, [[Salah al-Din Road]] (the modern [[Via Maris]]) runs through the middle of Gaza City, connecting it with Deir al-Balah, [[Khan Yunis]], and Rafah in the south and [[Jabalia]] and [[Beit Hanoun]] in the north.<ref name=autogenerated1>Sheehan, 2000, p.428.</ref> The northern crossing of Salah ad-Din Street into Israel is the [[Erez Crossing]] and the crossing into Egypt is the [[Rafah Crossing]].

[[Omar Mukhtar Street]] is the main road in the city of Gaza running north–south, branching off Salah ad-Din Street, stretching from the Rimal coastline and the Old City where it ends at the [[Gold Market]].<ref name="Sheehan" /> Prior to the [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip]], there existed regular lines of collective taxis to [[Ramallah]] and [[Hebron]] in the [[West Bank]].<ref name="MOG">[http://www.mogaza.org/gazacity.htm About Gaza City] Gaza Municipality. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620101738/http://www.mogaza.org/gazacity.htm |date=June 20, 2008 }}</ref> Except for private cars, Gaza City is served by taxis and buses.

The [[Yasser Arafat International Airport]] near [[Rafah]] opened in 1998 {{convert|40|km|mi}} south of Gaza. Its runways and facilities were damaged by the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] in 2001 and 2002, rendering the airport unusable. In August 2010, the tarmac ramp was destroyed by Palestinians seeking stones and recycled building materials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/video/middleeast/2010/08/2010815112013994444.html|title=Gazans rip apart airport tarmac|access-date=28 April 2017}}</ref> The [[Ben Gurion International Airport]] in Israel is located roughly {{convert|75|km|mi}} northeast of the city.<ref name="MOG" />
