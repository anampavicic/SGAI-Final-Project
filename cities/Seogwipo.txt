== History ==

=== Early history ===
Hundreds of Seogwipo’s oldest archeological artifacts were found in Saengsugwe Cave near Cheonjiyeon Waterfall on the south coast of Jeju. After an extensive excavation by a team of experts from Jeju National Museum in November 2010, hundred of Stone Age artifacts were unearthed. Another ancient location in Seogwipo is the village of Hamo. Artifacts found there during a 2005 excavation include pieces of earthenware and shell mounds from the Neolithic Age.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news |title=Seogwipo, a history - JEJU WEEKLY |url=http://www.jejuweekly.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=2609 |access-date=2016-03-12 |website=www.jejuweekly.com}}</ref>

In the beginning, Seogwipo was a part of [[Tamna]], an ancient kingdom of Jeju. The kingdom traded with other nations across the Korean peninsula and China during the period of the Three Kingdoms (1st century BCE to 7th century CE). The small port of Seogwipo was used to send tributes to Yuan, an ancient kingdom in China. Tamna briefly reclaimed its independence after the fall of Silla in 935. However, it was subjugated by the Goryeo Dynasty in 938, and officially annexed in 1105. In 1300, among the 14 villages that made up Tamna Prefecture were Hongro and Yerye, two regions of modern Seogwipo. Tamna maintained local autonomy until 1404, when Taejo of the Joseon Dynasty placed it under firm central control. During the Joseon era, three fortresses were built in the Seogwipo area. In 1416, southern Jeju Island was divided into the prefectures of Jeongui and Daejeong. The former included Hongro, and the latter, Yerye, which had been the urban centers of Seogwipo City.<ref name=":2" />

=== Modern history ===
In 1914, during the period of Japanese colonial rule, Jeongui prefecture and Daejeong prefecture were merged into Jeju-gun (''gun'' meaning an administrative district bigger than a prefecture), and the two centers of Seogwipo became Jeongui-myeon and Daejeong. In 1915 the names were changed a second time, to U township and Jwa township. In 1935 the two townships were given the names they still have today: Seogwi and Jungmun. Seogwipo was greatly affected by Japanese colonial rule - it was used as a base that supplied marine products, and a whale processing plant was built near the port of Seogwipo. Twelve artificial caves made by the Japanese army still remain along the coast near Sammaebong Peak.<ref name=":2" />

After the end of the colonial period, Seogwipo felt the hardship of the 1948 [[Jeju uprising]] and its aftermath. When the Korean War broke out in 1950, Seogwipo port became crowded with thousands of refugees.<ref name=":2" />

After the war, the island was rebuilt. As people's livelihoods stabilized, [[mandarin orange]] farming became the most profitable crop for the islanders. The Satsuma mandarin had been brought to Korea from Japan in 1911 by a [[Catholic]] [[missionary]] named Esmile J. Taque. Few farmers grew mandarins in the 1950s, and the mandarin orange commanded such high prices that mandarin tree was called ''daehaknamu'', meaning "the source of money for college tuition". The government supported mandarin farming from the early 1960s and rapidly increased the number of farms. Now, mandarins from Jeju are a winter staple throughout South Korea.<ref name=":2" />

In the meantime, Seogwipo's status as an administrative district improved. In 1946, the island became Jeju-do (province) and reorganized into Bukjeju-gun to the north of Mt. Halla and Namjeju-gun to the south, which Seogwi-myeon and Jungmun-myeon belonged to. After Jeju-eup (town) became Jeju-si (city) in 1955, Seogwi-myeon became Seogwi-eup in 1956 and was combined with Jungmun-myeon, which created Seogwipo-si and became independent from Namjeju-gun in 1981. In addition, a plan to reorganize the administrative district to combine Jeju-si and Bukjeju-gun, and Seogwipo-si and Namjeju-gun passed through the local referendum in 2005. As a result, Seogwipo City was expanded to cover Namjeju-gun in 2006 and the Jeju Special Self-Governing Province was established.<ref name=":2" />

Modern Seogwipo City has changed significantly since its days as a small village, and has renewed itself since Korean War. The Jungmun Tourism Complex is considered a premier Jeju tourist landmark. The Jeju World Cup Stadium welcomed thousands of visitors in 2002 during the South Korean/Japan World Cup. People from all over the world come to the International Convention Center Jeju in Jungmun for conventions. The Jeju Olle trails along the Seogwipo coast are most popular among hikers.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Seogwipo's atmosphere is similar to other Korean seaside towns - old love motels and old businesses. However, it also has lush gardens and citrus farms that are bordered with black rock fences. The whole town is small enough for people to walk across easily. The Olle Market in downtown Seogwipo is a traditional daily market. There is also much to see and eat along Lee Joong-seop Street, Myeongdong Road, Arang Joeul Street, and Chilsimni Food Street.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.jeju.go.kr/index.php/contents/Tour/MasterpieceJeju/downtown_areas/seogwipo|title=Downtown Seogwipo - Jeju Special Self-Governing Province|website=english.jeju.go.kr|access-date=2016-03-12}}</ref>
