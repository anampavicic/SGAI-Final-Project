'''Manitoba''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-ca-Manitoba.ogg|ˌ|m|æ|n|ɪ|ˈ|t|oʊ|b|ə}} {{respell|MAN|ih|TOH|bə}}) is a [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province of Canada]] at the [[Centre of Canada|longitudinal centre]] of the country. It is Canada's [[Population of Canada by province and territory|fifth-most populous province]], with a population of 1,342,153 as of 2021.<ref name=2021census/> Manitoba has a widely varied landscape, from [[arctic tundra]] and the [[Hudson Bay]] coastline in the [[Northern Region, Manitoba|north]] to dense [[Boreal forest of Canada|boreal forest]], large freshwater [[List of lakes of Manitoba|lakes]], and [[prairie]] grassland in the central and [[Southern Manitoba|southern]] regions.

[[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous peoples]] have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years. In the early 17th century, English and French [[North American fur trade|fur traders]] began arriving in the area and establishing settlements. The [[Kingdom of England]] secured control of the region in 1673 and created a territory named [[Rupert's Land]], which was placed under the administration of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. Rupert's Land, which included all of present-day Manitoba, grew and evolved from 1673 until 1869 with significant settlements of Indigenous and [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis people]] in the [[Red River Colony]]. Negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba commenced in 1869, but deep disagreements over the right to [[self-determination]] led to an armed conflict, known as the [[Red River Rebellion]], between the federal government and the people (particularly Métis) of the Red River Colony. The resolution of the conflict and further negotiations led to Manitoba becoming the fifth province to join [[Canadian Confederation]], when the [[Parliament of Canada]] passed the ''[[Manitoba Act]]'' on 15 July 1870.

Manitoba's [[Capital city|capital]] and [[List of cities in Manitoba|largest city]] is [[Winnipeg]], the [[List of the largest municipalities in Canada by population|sixth most populous municipality]] in Canada. Winnipeg is the seat of government, home to the [[Legislative Assembly of Manitoba]] and the [[Provincial Court of Manitoba|Provincial Court]]. Four of the province's five universities, all four of its professional sports teams, and most of its cultural activities (including [[Festival du Voyageur]] and [[Folklorama]]) are located in Winnipeg. The city has an [[Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport|international airport]] as well as train and bus stations; a [[Canadian Forces base]], [[CFB Winnipeg]], operates from the airport and is the regional headquarters of the [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]].

== Etymology ==
The name ''Manitoba''  possibly derives from either [[Cree language|Cree]] {{lang|cr|manitou-wapow}} or [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]]  {{lang|oj|manidoobaa}}, both meaning {{gloss|straits of [[Manitou]], the Great Spirit}}.<ref>{{vcite book|title=Native Americans State by State|author=Sapp, Rick|page=330||year=2018|publisher=Chartwell Books}}</ref> Alternatively, it may be from the [[Assiniboine language|Assiniboine]] {{lang|asb|minnetoba}}, meaning {{gloss|Lake of the Prairie}}<ref>{{vcite web|url=http://geonames.nrcan.gc.ca/education/prov_e.php#mb|title=Manitoba|publisher=Natural Resources Canada|accessdate=28 October 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604204017/http://geonames.nrcan.gc.ca/education/prov_e.php#mb|archivedate=4 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{vcite book|title=Strange Empire, a Narrative of the Northwest|author=Howard, Joseph Kinsey|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0873512985|page=192}}</ref> (the lake was known to French explorers as {{lang|fr|Lac des Prairies}}). The name was chosen by Thomas Spence for [[Republic of Manitobah|the new republic]] he proposed for the area south of the lake. [[Métis]] leader [[Louis Riel]] preferred the name over the proposed alternative of "Assiniboia". It was accepted in Ottawa under the ''[[Manitoba Act, 1870]]''.<ref>{{vcite web|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/louis_riel/pdf/origin_mb_name.pdf|accessdate=20 October 2013|publisher=Province of Manitoba|title=The Origin of the Name Manitoba|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319044125/http://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/louis_riel/pdf/origin_mb_name.pdf|archivedate=19 March 2013}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Main|History of Manitoba}}

===Indigenous societies and European settlement===

Modern-day Manitoba was inhabited by the [[First Nations in Canada|First Nations]] people shortly after the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]] glaciers retreated in the southwest about 10,000 years ago; the first exposed land was the [[Turtle Mountain (plateau)|Turtle Mountain]] area.<ref>{{vcite journal|author=Ritchie, James AM; Brown, Frank; Brien, David|year=2008|title=The Cultural Transmission of the Spirit of Turtle Mountain: A Centre for Peace and Trade for 10,000 Years|journal=General Assembly and International Scientific Symposium|publisher=International Council on Monuments and Sites|volume=16|pages=4–6}}</ref> The [[Ojibwe]], [[Cree]], [[Dene]], [[Sioux]], [[Mandan]], and [[Assiniboine]] peoples founded settlements, and other tribes entered the area to trade. In Northern Manitoba, [[quartz]] was mined to make [[arrowhead]]s. The first farming in Manitoba was along the Red River, where [[Maize|corn]] and other seed crops were planted before contact with Europeans.<ref>{{vcite journal|author=Flynn, Catherine; Syms, E Leigh|date=Spring 1996|title=Manitoba's First Farmers|journal=Manitoba History|publisher=Manitoba Historical Society|issue=31}}</ref>

In 1611, [[Henry Hudson]] was one of the first Europeans to sail into what is now known as Hudson Bay, where he was abandoned by his crew.<ref>{{vcite book|author=Neatby, LH|title=Dictionary of Canadian Biography|publisher=University of Toronto/Université Laval|year=2013|orig-year=1966|editor=Cook, Ramsay|volume=1|pages=374–379|chapter=Henry Hudson|edition=online|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/hudson_henry_1E.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212000811/http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/hudson_henry_1E.html|archivedate=12 February 2016}}</ref> [[Thomas Button]] travelled this area in 1612 in an unsuccessful attempt to find and rescue Hudson.<ref>{{vcite book|author=Eames, Aled|title=Dictionary of Canadian Biography|publisher=University of Toronto/Université Laval|year=1979|orig-year=1966|editor=Cook, Ramsay|volume=1|pages=144–145|chapter=Sir Thomas Button|edition=online|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/button_thomas_1E.html|url-  status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222132621/http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/button_thomas_1E.html|archivedate=22 December 2015}}</ref> When the British ship ''[[Nonsuch (1650 ship)|Nonsuch]]'' sailed into Hudson Bay in 1668–1669, she became the first trading vessel to reach the area; that voyage led to the formation of the Hudson's Bay Company, to which the British government gave absolute control of the entire Hudson Bay watershed.

[[Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La Vérendrye]], visited the Red River Valley in the 1730s to help open the area for French exploration and trade.<ref>{{vcite book|author=Zoltvany, Yves F|title=Dictionary of Canadian Biography|publisher=University of Toronto/Université Lava|year=2015|orig-year=1974|editor=Cook, Ramsay|volume=3|pages=246–254|chapter=Pierre Gaultier De Varennes et De La Vérendrye|edition=online|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/gaultier_de_varennes_et_de_la_verendrye_pierre_3E.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105180950/http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/gaultier_de_varennes_et_de_la_verendrye_pierre_3E.html|archivedate=5 January 2016}}</ref> As French explorers entered the area, a [[Montreal]]-based company, the [[North West Company]], began trading with the local Indigenous people. Both the North West Company and the Hudson's Bay Company built fur-trading forts; the two companies competed in southern Manitoba, occasionally resulting in violence, until they merged in 1821 (the [[Hudson's Bay Company Archives]] in Winnipeg preserve the history of this era).<ref name="simmons"/>

[[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] secured the territory in 1763 after their victory over France in the North American theatre of the [[Seven Years' War]], better known as the [[French and Indian War]] in North America; lasting from 1754 to 1763. The founding of the first agricultural community and settlements in 1812 by [[Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk|Lord Selkirk]], north of the area which is now downtown Winnipeg, led to conflict between British colonists and the Métis.<ref>{{vcite book|author=Gray, John Morgan|title=Dictionary of Canadian Biography|publisher=University of Toronto/Université Laval|year=2015|orig-year=1983|editor=Cook, Ramsay|volume=5|pages=264–269|chapter=Thomas Douglas|edition=online|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/douglas_thomas_5E.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222094924/http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/douglas_thomas_5E.html|archivedate=22 December 2015}}</ref> Twenty colonists, including the governor, and one Métis were killed in the [[Battle of Seven Oaks (1816)|Battle of Seven Oaks]] in 1816.<ref>{{vcite journal|author=Martin, Joseph E|year=1965|title=The 150th Anniversary of Seven Oaks|journal=MHS Transactions|publisher=Manitoba Historical Society|volume=3|issue=22}}</ref>

=== Confederation ===
[[File:Canada provinces evolution 2.gif|thumb|right|alt=When Canada was formed in 1867 its provinces were a relatively narrow strip in the southeast, with vast territories in the interior. It grew by adding British Columbia in 1871, P.E.I. in 1873, the British Arctic Islands in 1880, and Newfoundland in 1949; meanwhile, its provinces grew both in size and number at the expense of its territories.|Territorial evolution of Canada, 1867–present]]

Rupert's Land was ceded to Canada by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1869 and incorporated into the Northwest Territories; a lack of attention to Métis concerns caused Métis leader [[Louis Riel]] to establish a local provisional government which formed into the Convention of Forty and the subsequent elected [[Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia]] on 9 March 1870.<ref>{{vcite web |title=Indigenous and Northern Relations |url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/inr/resources/print,the-legislative-assembly-of-assiniboia.html |publisher=Province of Manitoba|accessdate=21 October 2018|archivedate=14 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181014010142/https://www.gov.mb.ca/inr/resources/print,the-legislative-assembly-of-assiniboia.html}}</ref><ref>{{vcite web |author==Lawrence, Barkwell |title=A History of the Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia/le Conseil du {{as written|Gover|nement}} Provisoire |url=http://www.legislativeassemblyofassiniboia.ca/sites/default/files/history_legislative_assembly_of_assiniboia_final_w_footnotes.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023084632/http://legislativeassemblyofassiniboia.ca/sites/default/files/history_legislative_assembly_of_assiniboia_final_w_footnotes.pdf |url-status=dead |archivedate=23 October 2018 |publisher=Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia }}</ref> This assembly subsequently sent three delegates to [[Ottawa]] to negotiate with the [[government of Canada|Canadian government]].

[[Numbered Treaties]] were signed in the late 19th century with the chiefs of First Nations that lived in the area. They made specific promises of land for every family. As a result, a [[Indian reserve|reserve system]] was established under the jurisdiction of the [[Government of Canada|federal government]].<ref>{{vcite book|author=Tough, Frank|title=As Their Natural Resources Fail: Native People and the Economic History of Northern Manitoba, 1870–1930|publisher=UBC Press|year=1997|pages=75–79|isbn=978-0-7748-0571-1}}</ref> The prescribed amount of land promised to the native peoples was not always given; this led Indigenous groups to assert rights to the land through [[aboriginal land claim|land claims]], many of which are still ongoing.<ref>{{vcite web|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/stem/mrd/mines/sustain/first.html|title=First Nations Land Claims|publisher=Government of Manitoba|accessdate=28 October 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030030837/http://www.gov.mb.ca/stem/mrd/mines/sustain/first.html <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=30 October 2009}}</ref>

The original province of Manitoba was a square one-eighteenth of its current size, and was known colloquially as the "postage stamp province".<ref name="postage">{{vcite journal|author=Kemp, Douglas|date=April 1956|title=From Postage Stamp to Keystone|journal=Manitoba Pageant|publisher=Manitoba Historical Society}}</ref> Its borders were expanded in 1881, taking land from the Northwest Territories and the [[District of Keewatin]], but Ontario claimed a large portion of the land; the disputed portion was awarded to Ontario in 1889. Manitoba grew to its current size in 1912, absorbing land from the Northwest Territories to reach 60°N, uniform with the northern reach of its western neighbours Saskatchewan, Alberta and [[British Columbia]].<ref name="postage" />

The [[Manitoba Schools Question]] showed the deep divergence of cultural values in the territory. The Catholic Franco-Manitobans had been guaranteed a state-supported [[separate school]] system in the original constitution of Manitoba, but a grassroots political movement among English [[Protestantism|Protestants]] from 1888 to 1890 demanded the end of French schools. In 1890, the Manitoba legislature passed a law removing funding for [[Catholic schools in Canada|French Catholic schools]].<ref name="language">{{vcite journal|author=Fletcher, Robert|year=1949|title=The Language Problem in Manitoba's Schools|journal=MHS Transactions|publisher=Manitoba Historical Society|volume=3|issue=6}}</ref> The French Catholic minority asked the federal government for support; however, the [[Orange Order in Canada|Orange Order]] and other anti-Catholic forces mobilized nationwide to oppose them.<ref>{{vcite journal|author=McLauchlin, Kenneth|year=1986|title='Riding The Protestant Horse': The Manitoba Schools Question and Canadian Politics, 1890–1896|journal=Historical Studies|publisher=CCHA|volume=53|pages=39–52}}</ref> The federal [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservatives]] proposed remedial legislation to override Manitoba, but they were blocked by the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]], led by [[Wilfrid Laurier]].<ref name="language" /> Once elected Prime Minister in 1896, Laurier implemented a compromise stating Catholics in Manitoba could have their own religious instruction for 30 minutes at the end of the day if there were enough students to warrant it, implemented on a school-by-school basis.<ref name="language" />

During the First World War, [[Nellie McClung]] started the campaign for women's votes. On January 28, 1916, the vote for women was legalized. Manitoba was the first province to allow women to vote in provincial elections. This was two years before Canada as a country granted women the right to vote.<ref>{{vcite web|url=https://cfc-swc.gc.ca/commemoration/cent/index-en.html|title=100th Anniversary of Women's First Right to Vote in Canada|publisher=Status of Women Canada|accessdate=17 December 2019|archivedate=28 November 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191128184144/https://cfc-swc.gc.ca/commemoration/cent/index-en.html}}</ref>

After the First World War ended, severe discontent among farmers (over wheat prices) and union members (over wage rates) resulted in an upsurge of [[Political radicalism|radicalism]], coupled with a polarization over the rise of [[Bolshevik|Bolshevism]] in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]].<ref>{{vcite book|author=Conway, John Frederick|title=The West: The History of a Region in Confederation |publisher=Lorimer|year=2005|edition=3rd|pages=63–64, 85–100|isbn=978-1-55028-905-3}}</ref> The most dramatic result was the [[Winnipeg general strike]] of 1919.

Canada entered the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1939. Winnipeg was one of the major commands for the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] to train fighter pilots, and there were air training schools throughout Manitoba. Several Manitoba-based regiments were deployed overseas, including [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]]. In an effort to raise money for the war effort, the [[Canada Savings Bond|Victory Loan]] campaign organized "[[If Day]]" in 1942. The event featured a simulated [[Nazism|Nazi]] invasion and occupation of Manitoba, and eventually raised over [[Canadian dollar|C$]]65 million.<ref>{{vcite journal|author=Newman, Michael|date=Spring 1987|title=February 19, 1942: If Day|journal=Manitoba History|publisher=Manitoba Historical Society|issue=13|url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/mb_history/13/ifday.shtml|archivedate=19 February 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190219015553/http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/mb_history/13/ifday.shtml}}</ref>

[[File:Red River Floodway from the air.JPG|thumb|Aerial view of the [[Red River Floodway]]]]
Winnipeg was inundated during the [[1950 Red River Flood]] and had to be partially evacuated. In that year, the Red River reached its highest level since 1861 and flooded most of the Red River Valley. The damage caused by the flood led then-Premier [[Dufferin Roblin|Duff Roblin]] to advocate for the construction of the [[Red River Floodway]]; it was completed in 1968 after six years of excavation. Permanent dikes were erected in eight towns south of Winnipeg, and clay dikes and diversion dams were built in the Winnipeg area. In 1997, the "[[1997 Red River flood|Flood of the Century]]" caused over {{Nowrap|C$400 million}} in damages in Manitoba, but the floodway prevented Winnipeg from flooding.<ref>{{vcite journal|author=Haque, C Emdad|date=May 2000|title=Risk Assessment, Emergency Preparedness and Response to Hazards: The Case of the 1997 Red River Valley Flood, Canada|journal=Natural Hazards|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|volume=21|issue=2|pages=226–237|issn=0921-030X|doi=10.1023/a:1008108208545}}</ref>

In 1990, Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] attempted to pass the [[Meech Lake Accord]], a series of constitutional amendments to persuade [[Quebec]] to endorse the ''[[Canada Act 1982]]''. Unanimous support in the legislature was needed to bypass public consultation.

Manitoba is bordered by the provinces of [[Ontario]] to the east and [[Saskatchewan]] to the west, the territory of [[Nunavut]] to the north, and the [[US states]] of [[North Dakota]] and [[Minnesota]] to the south. Manitoba is at the centre of the Hudson Bay drainage basin, with a high volume of the water draining into Lake Winnipeg and then north down the [[Nelson River]] into Hudson Bay. This basin's rivers reach far west to the mountains, far south into the United States, and east into Ontario. Major watercourses include the [[Red River of the North|Red]], [[Assiniboine River|Assiniboine]], Nelson, [[Winnipeg River|Winnipeg]], [[Hayes River|Hayes]], [[Whiteshell River|Whiteshell]] and [[Churchill River (Hudson Bay)|Churchill rivers]]. Most of Manitoba's inhabited south has developed in the prehistoric bed of [[Lake Agassiz|Glacial Lake Agassiz]]. This region, particularly the [[Red River Valley]], is flat and fertile; receding glaciers left hilly and rocky areas throughout the province.<ref>{{vcite book|author=Savage, Candace|title=Prairie: A Natural History|publisher=Greystone Books|year=2011|pages=52–53|isbn=978-1-55365-588-6|edition=2nd}}</ref>

[[Southern Manitoba]] (including the city of Winnipeg), falls into the humid continental climate zone (Köppen Dfb). This area is cold and windy in the winter and often has blizzards because of the open landscape. Summers are warm with a moderate length. This region is the most humid area in the prairie provinces, with moderate precipitation. Southwestern Manitoba, though under the same climate classification as the rest of Southern Manitoba, is closer to the semi-arid interior of [[Palliser's Triangle]].

=== Economic history ===
[[File:Red River cart train 2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A line of wooden carts with wagon wheels pulled by oxen move down a path through a prairie|Red River cart train]]
Manitoba's early economy depended on mobility and living off the land. Indigenous Nations (Cree, Ojibwa, Dene, Sioux and Assiniboine) followed herds of bison and congregated to trade among themselves at key meeting places throughout the province. After the arrival of the first European traders in the 17th century, the economy centred on the trade of beaver pelts and other furs.<ref name="prairies">{{vcite book|author=Friesen, Gerald|title=The Canadian prairies: a history|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1987|pages=22–47, 66, 183–184|isbn=978-0-8020-6648-0}}</ref> Diversification of the economy came when Lord Selkirk brought the first agricultural settlers in 1811,<ref name="lord selkirk">{{vcite journal|author=Morton, William L|date=April 1962|title=Lord Selkirk Settlers|journal=Manitoba Pageant|publisher=Manitoba Historical Society|volume=7|issue=3}}</ref> though the triumph of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) over its competitors ensured the primacy of the fur trade over widespread agricultural colonization.<ref name="prairies"/>

HBC control of Rupert's Land ended in 1868; when Manitoba became a province in 1870, all land became the property of the federal government, with homesteads granted to settlers for farming.<ref name="prairies"/> Transcontinental railways were constructed to simplify trade. Manitoba's economy depended mainly on farming, which persisted until drought and the Great Depression led to further diversification.<ref name="easterbrook"/>
