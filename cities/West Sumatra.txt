West Sumatra borders the Indian Ocean to the west, as well as the provinces of [[North Sumatra]] to the north, [[Riau]] to the northeast, [[Jambi]] to the southeast, and [[Bengkulu]] to the south.

West Sumatra is home to the [[Minangkabau people]], although the traditional Minangkabau region is actually wider than the province's boundaries, covering up to the western coast of North Sumatra, the southwestern coast of Aceh, the western region of Riau, the western region of Jambi, the northern region of Bengkulu, and {{Lang|ms|[[Negeri Sembilan]]|italic=no}} in [[Malaysia]]. Another native ethnic group is the [[Mentawai people]], who inhabit the western islands of the same name. [[Islam]] is a predominant religion in the province, with about 97.4% of the total population.

West Sumatra was the centre of the [[Pagaruyung Kingdom]], founded by [[Adityawarman]] in 1347. The first European to come to the region was a French traveler named [[Jean Parmentier (explorer)|Jean Parmentier]] who arrived around 1523. The region was later colonised by the [[Dutch Empire]] and became a [[Residency (country subdivision)|residency]] named Sumatra's West Coast ({{langx|nl|Sumatra's Westkust}}), whose administrative area included the present-day [[Kampar Regency]] in Riau and [[Kerinci Regency]] in Jambi. Before becoming a province in 1957, West Sumatra was a part of the province of Central Sumatra (1948–1957), alongside Riau, Jambi, and the [[Riau Islands]].

== Etymology ==
West Sumatra is known by the name ''Bumi Minangkabau'' (Land of Minangkabau), as it is the home and origin of the [[Minangkabau people]]. The ''Minangkabau'' name comes from two words namely, ''Minang'' (win) and ''Kabau'' (cattle). The name is associated with a Minangkabau legend known as ''Tambo''. From the ''Tambo'', it is said that at one time there was a foreign kingdom (usually interpreted as the [[Majapahit|Majapahit Empire]]) which came from the sea and would conquer what is now West Sumatra.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}} To prevent fighting in the region, the local people propose a cattle race competition with the foreign forces. The foreign forces agreed and sent a large and aggressive cattle to the competition, while the local community sent a cattle calf who was still breastfeeding to the competition. In the competition, the cattle calf who was still breastfeeding thought the large and aggressive cattle was the mother. So the calf immediately ran towards the large and aggressive cattle to find milk until he tore apart the big cattle's stomach. The victory inspired the local people to use the name ''Minangkabau,'' which comes from the phrase "''Manang kabau''" (winning cattle).<ref name="Djamaris">{{cite book|title=Tambo Minangkabau|last=Djamaris|first=Edwar|publisher=Balai Pustaka|year=1991|isbn=978-979-1477-09-3|location=Jakarta|pages=220–221}}</ref> The story of the Tambo is also found in the {{Lang|ms|[[Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai]]}} which also mentions that the victory made the country that was previously named ''Pariangan'' changed to the name ''Minangkabau''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai|last=Hill|first=A.H.|publisher=Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|year=1960|location=London|ref=Pasai}}</ref> Furthermore, the use of the name ''Minangkabau'' is also used to refer to a [[Nagari (settlement)|''nagari'']] (village), namely the ''Nagari Minangkabau'', which is located in Sungayang District, [[Tanah Datar Regency]].

In the historical record of the Majapahit Empire, {{Lang|kaw|[[Nagarakretagama]]}} which dated from 1365, also mentioned the name ''Minangkabwa'' as one of the Malay countries that has been conquered by the Majapahit.<ref>{{cite book|title=Nāgarakrětāgama; Lofdicht van Prapanjtja op Koning Radjasanagara, Hajam Wuruk, van Madjapahit, Naar Het Eenige Daarvan Bekende Handschrift, Aangetroffen in de Puri te Tjakranagara op Lombok|last=Brandes|first=J.L.A.|year=1902|ref=Brandes}}</ref> Likewise in the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] Chronicles from 1405, there was the royal name of ''Mi-nang-ge-bu'' of the six kingdoms who sent messengers facing [[Yongle Emperor]] in [[Nanjing]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2005 |title=Southeast Asia in the Ming Shi-lu: An Open Access Resource |url=http://www.epress.nus.edu.sg/msl/ |publisher=Asia Research Institute and the Singapore E-Press, National University of Singapore |location=Singapore |translator-last=Wade |translator-first=Geoff |access-date=2022-03-02 |archive-date=2012-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025015112/http://epress.nus.edu.sg/msl/ |url-status=live }}</ref> On the other hand, the name ''Minang'' (Minanga kingdom) itself has also been mentioned in the [[Kedukan Bukit inscription]] dated from 682 which is written in [[Sanskrit]]. In the inscription, it was stated that the founder of the [[Srivijaya|Srivijaya Empire]] named [[Sri Jayanasa of Srivijaya|Dapunta Hyang]] departed from a place called ''Minānga''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Les Inscriptions Malaises de Çrivijaya|last=Cœdès|first=George|publisher=BEFEO|year=1930|ref=Cœdès}}</ref> Some experts who refer to the source of the inscription suspects that the 4th line words (... ''minānga'') and the 5th line words (''tāmvan'' ...) are actually incorporated, so that they become ''mināngatāmvan'' and are translated as the meeting point of twin rivers. The twin river is supposed to refer to the meeting of two sources of the [[Kampar River]], namely the [[Kampar Kiri River]] and the [[Kampar Kanan River]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Riwajat Indonesia|last=Purbatjaraka|first=R.M. Ngabehi|publisher=Jajasan Pembangunan|year=1952|location=Jakarta|ref=Purbatjaraka}}</ref> But this hypothesis is denied by the Dutch indologist [[Johannes Gijsbertus de Casparis]], which proves that ''tāmvan'' has nothing to do with "meeting point", because these can also be found in other Srivijaya relics.<ref>{{cite book|title=Prasasti Indonesia II|last=Casparis|first=J.G.

==History==
=== Prehistoric era ===
[[File:Masjid Pariangan.jpg|thumb|The village of Pariangan, located on the slopes of [[Mount Marapi]], In folklore is said to be the first Minangkabau village.]]

From the stories of the ''tambo'' passed from generation to generation, the ancestors of the Minangkabau people were the descendants of [[Alexander the Great in legend|Iskandar]] [[Dhul-Qarnayn|Zulkarnain]] ([[Alexander the Great]]).<ref name="Navis-1">{{cite book|title=Alam Terkembang Jadi Guru: Adat dan Kebudayaan Minangkabau|last=Navis|first=A.A.|publisher=Grafiti Pers|year=1984|location=Jakarta|author-link=A.A. Navis}}</ref> This tambo story is more or less comparable to the [[Malay Annals]] who also tells how the Minangkabau people sent their representatives to ask [[Sang Sapurba]], one of the descendants of Iskandar Zulkarnain, to become their king.<ref>{{cite book|title=Malay Annals|last=Raffles|first=T.S.|year=1821|ref=Raffles|author-link=Stamford Raffles}} Penerjemah: John Leyden, Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, dan Brown.</ref>

The Minang community is part of the Deutro-Malay community who migrated from [[South China|Southern China]] to the island of Sumatra around 2,500–2,000 years ago. It is estimated that this community group entered from the east of the island of Sumatra, along the [[Kampar River]] to the highlands called ''darek'' which became the home of the Minangkabau people.<ref>Graves (1981). pg 4.</ref> Some of these ''darek'' areas then form a kind of confederation known as ''luhak'', which is then referred to as ''Luhak Nan Tigo'', which consists of ''Luhak Tanah Data'', ''Luhak Agam'', and ''Luhak Limopuluah Koto''. During the era of the [[Dutch East Indies]], the ''luhak'' area became a territorial government area called ''afdeling'', headed by a resident who by the Minangkabau community was called the name ''Tuan Luhak.''<ref name="Navis-1"/> Initially, The Minangkabau people were included as a sub-group of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], but since the 19th century, the Minangkabau and the Malays began to be seen as distinguished, from the matrilineal culture of the Minangkabau that persisted compared to the patrilineal culture adopted by Malay society in general.<ref>{{cite book|title=Leaves of the Same Tree: Trade and Ethnicity in the Straits of Melaka|url=https://archive.org/details/leavesofsametree0000anda|url-access=registration|last=Andaya|first=L.Y.|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8248-3189-9|ref=Andaya}}</ref>

=== Precolonial era ===
[[File:055 Bhairawa Adityavarman, Padang Roco, West Sumatra, 14th c (23464008076).jpg|upright|thumb|A statue believed to be [[Adityawarman]], founder of a Minangkabau kingdom.]]

According to the Minangkabau ''Tambo'', in the period between the 1st century to the 16th century, many small kingdoms stood on what is now West Sumatra. These kingdoms included the Kuntu, Kandis, Siguntur, Pasumayan Koto Batu, Batu Patah, Sungai Pagu, Inderapura, Jambu Lipo, Taraguang, Dusun Tuo, Bungo Setangkai, Talu, Kinali, Parit Batu, Pulau Punjung. These kingdoms were short lived, and are usually under the influence of larger kingdoms, such as [[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu]] and Pagaruyung.

The [[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu Kingdom]] is estimated to have appeared in the year 645 thought to be located in the upper reaches of the [[Batang Hari River]]. Based on the [[Kedukan Bukit inscription]], this kingdom was conquered by the [[Srivijaya]] in 682. And then in 1183 it appeared again based on the [[Grahi inscription]] in Cambodia, and then the ''[[Nagarakretagama|Negarakertagama]]'' and ''[[Pararaton]]'' recorded the existence of the Malay Kingdom which had its capital in [[Dharmasraya Regency|Dharmasraya]]. A military expedition to West Sumatra called the [[Pamalayu]] emerged in 1275–1293 under the leadership of Kebo Anabrang of the [[Singhasari|Singasari Kingdom]]. After the submission of the kingdom recorded on the [[Amoghapasa inscription|''Amoghapasa'']] carved on the [[Padang Roco Inscription]], the Pamalayu returned to Java with the daughters of King Dharmasraya, [[Dara Petak]] and [[Dara Jingga]]. Dara Petak was married to [[Raden Wijaya]], the king of [[Majapahit]], as well as the heir to the Singhasari kingdom, while Dara Jingga was married to [[Adwayawarman]]. Jayanagara was born from the marriage of Raden Wijaya and Dara Petak, who would become the second king of Majapahit, while [[Adityawarman]] was born from the marriage of Dara Jingga and Adwayawarman; he later became king of the [[Pagaruyung Kingdom]].

[[Hinduism|Hindu]]-[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] influence in western Sumatra emerged around the 13th century, and began during the Pamalayu expedition by [[Kertanegara of Singhasari|Kertanagara]], and later during the reign of Adityawarman and his son [[Ananggawarman]].<ref name="Sanskrit in Southeast Asia">{{cite book|title=Sanskrit in Southeast Asia|last=Mahāwitthayālai Sinlapākō̜n|publisher=Sanskrit Studies Centre, Silpakorn University|year=2003|isbn =974-641-045-8|author2=Phāk Wichā Phāsā Tawanʻō̜k}}</ref> Adityawarman's kingdom had the strength to dominate the central Sumatra region and its surrounding.<ref name="Cap">{{Cite journal |last=Casparis |first=J.G. |author-link=Johannes Gijsbertus de Casparis |year=1989 |title=Peranan Adityawarman Putera Melayu di Asia Tenggara |journal=Tamadun Melayu |volume=3 |pages=918–943}}</ref> This was proven by the title ''Maharajadiraja'' which was held by Adityawarman recorded on the back of the Amoghapasa carving, found in the upper reaches of the [[Batang Hari River]] (now part of the [[Dharmasraya Regency]]). The [[Batusangkar inscription]] mentioned Ananggawarman as a [[yuvaraja]] performing the [[Tantra|Tantris]] teaching ritual from Buddhism called [[hevajra]] which is the ceremony of the transfer of power from Adityawarman to his crown prince, this can be attributed to the Chinese chronicle of 1377 about the ''[[Sanfotsi|San-fo-ts'i]]'' messenger to the [[Emperor of China]] requesting recognition as ruler of the ''San-fo-ts'i'' region.<ref>{{cite book|title=The archaeology and history of West Sumatra|last=Suleiman|first=S.|publisher=Pusat Penelitian Purbakala dan Peninggalan Nasional, Departemen P & K|year=1977|author-link=Satyawati Suleiman}}</ref>  Some inland areas of central Sumatra are still influenced by Buddhism, evident in the Padangroco temple, the [[Padang Lawas archaeological site|Padanglawas]] temple and [[Muara Takus]] temple, the areas that were formerly part of Adityawarman's land.<ref name="Mul">{{cite book|title=Runtuhnya Kerajaan Hindu-Jawa dan Timbulnya Negara-negara Islam di Nusantara|last=Muljana|first=S.|publisher=PT LKiS Pelangi Aksara|year=2005|location=Yogyakarta|isbn =9789798451164|author-link=Slamet Muljana}}</ref> Whereas the recorded devout adherents besides Adityawarman, were [[Kublai Khan]] and king [[Kertanegara of Singhasari]].<ref name="Poepo">{{cite book|title=Sejarah nasional Indonesia: Jaman kuno|last=Poesponegoro|first=M.D.|publisher=PT Balai Pustaka|year=1992|location=Jakarta|isbn=979-407-408-X|author2=Notosusanto, N.}}</ref>

The [[Spread of Islam in Indonesia|spread of Islam]] after the end of the 14th century had little effect, especially relating to the patrilineal system, and gave a relatively new phenomenon to the people in the interior of Minangkabau. At the beginning of the 16th century, the ''[[Tomé Pires|Suma Oriental]]'', written between 1513 and 1515, recorded from the three Minangkabau kings, only one of whom had been a Muslim convert from 15 years before.<ref name="Cortes">Cortesão, Armando, (1944), ''The Suma Oriental of Tomé Pires'', London: Hakluyt Society, 2 vols.</ref> The influence of [[Islam]] in Pagaruyung developed around the 16th century, namely through travelers and religious teachers who stopped or came from [[Aceh]] and [[Malacca]]. One of the famous ulama of Aceh, [[Abd al-Rauf al-Sinkili]], was a cleric who was thought to first spread Islam in Pagaruyung. By the 17th century, the Kingdom of Pagaruyung transformed itself into an Islamic [[sultan]]ate. The first Islamic king in the Minangkabau traditional culture was Sultan Alif.<ref name="Dt">Batuah, A. Dt. & Madjoindo, A. Dt., (1959), ''Tambo Minangkabau dan Adatnya'', Jakarta: Balai Pustaka.</ref>

With the entry of Islam, the customary rules that are contrary to the teachings of Islam began to be replaced with the Islamic-based customary law. There is a famous Minangkabau custom proverb, "''Adat basandi syarak, syarak basandi Kitabullah''", which means that the Minangkabau adat is based on Islam, while Islam is based on the [[Quran|Qur'an]]. But in some cases, several systems and methods of adat were still maintained causing the outbreak of civil war known as the [[Padri War]]. The war was initially between the [[ulama]]s and the ''Adats'', who were the Minangkabau nobility and traditional chiefs; later, the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] involved themselves in the war.<ref name="Kep">Kepper, G., (1900), ''Wapenfeiten van het Nederlands Indische Leger; 1816–1900'', M.M. Cuvee, Den Haag.</ref>

Islam also had an influence on Pagaruyung kingdom's government system with the addition of government elements such as ''Tuan Kadi'' and several other terms related to Islam. The naming of the Sumpur Kudus District, which contains the words derived from the word ''Quduus'' (holy) as the seat of ''Rajo Ibadat'' and ''Limo Kaum'' which contains the word ''qaum'' is an influence from [[Arabic]] or Islam. In addition, in the ''adat'', the term ''Imam'', ''Katik'' ([[Khatib]]), ''Bila'' (Bilal), ''Malin'' (Mu'alim), which is a substitute for Hindu and Buddhist terms used previously, such as the term ''Pandito'' (priest), also appears.

=== Colonial era ===
[[File:Heldhaftig-gedrag-van-luite.jpg|thumb|Dutch forces charging towards Minangkabau position during the [[Padri War]]]]

[[File:Imam Bonjol in 5000 IDR.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Tuanku Imam Bonjol]] was one of the leader of the Padri movement during the [[Padri War]]. Ultimately he was captured the Dutch and was exiled to the [[Sulawesi|Celebes]]]]

At the beginning of the 17th century, the Pagaruyung Kingdom was forced to recognize the sovereignty of the [[Aceh Sultanate]], and to recognize the designated Aceh governors for the west coast of Sumatra.<ref>Kathirithamby-Wells, J., (1969), ''Achehnese Control over West Sumatra up to the Treaty of Painan of 1663'', JSEAH 10, 3:453–479.</ref> But around 1665, the Minangkabau people on the west coast rebelled against the Aceh governor.

As a result of the conflict between the [[British Empire|British]] and [[First French Empire|French]] in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] where the Dutch were on the French side, the British fought the Dutch and again succeeded in taking control of the coast of West Sumatra between 1795 and 1819. The British governor [[Stamford Raffles|Thomas Stamford Raffles]] visited Pagaruyung in 1818, when the [[Padri War]] began.

The Dutch reaffirmed their influence on the island of Sumatra and Pagaruyung, with the signing of the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]]. The power of the king of Pagaruyung was very weak in the days leading up to the Padri war, although the king was still respected by his subject. The areas on the western coast fell into the influence of Aceh, while [[Inderapura]] on the southern coast practically became an independent kingdom although officially still under the rule of the king of Pagaruyung.

In the early 19th century a conflict broke out between the ''Padri'' and the ''Adat''. In several negotiations there was no agreement between them. Pagaruyung's kingdom was in turmoil, and the peak of the war was when the Padri under the leadership of [[Tuanku Pasaman]] attacked Pagaruyung in 1815. Sultan Arifin Muningsyah was forced to abdicate and escape from the royal capital to Lubuk Jambi.<ref>{{cite book|title=Herinneringen uit den Levensloop van een Indisch Ambtenaar van 1815 tot 1851: Medegedeeld in briefen door E.

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De woning van de gouverneur aan de westkust van Sumatra TMnr 3728-846.jpg|thumb|The residence of the governor of ''Westkust van Sumatra'']]
The name West Sumatra originated in the Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC) era, where the designation of the area for the west coast of Sumatra was ''Hoofdcomptoir van Sumatra's Westkust''. Then with the strengthening of the political and economic influence of the VOC, until the 18th century this administrative region included the west coast of Sumatra from [[Barus]] to [[Inderapura]].<ref name="Gusti">Asnan, Gusti, (2007), ''Memikir ulang regionalisme: Sumatra Barat tahun 1950-an'', Yayasan Obor Indonesia, {{ISBN|978-979-461-640-6}}.</ref> Along with the fall of the Kingdom of Pagaruyung, and the involvement of the Dutch in the Padri War, the Dutch East Indies government began to make the interior of Minangkabau a part of ''Pax Nederlandica'', an area under Dutch supervision, and the Minangkabau region was divided into the ''Residentie Padangsche Benedenlanden'' and the ''Residentie Padangsche Bovenlanden''.<ref name="Amran"/> Furthermore, in the development of the colonial administration of the Dutch East Indies, this area was incorporated in the ''Gouvernement Sumatra's Westkust'', including the ''Residentie Bengkulu'' region which had just been surrendered by the British to the Dutch. Then expanded again by including Tapanuli and [[Singkil, Indonesia|Singkil]]. But in 1905, the status of Tapanuli was upgraded to ''Residentie Tapanuli'', while the Singkil area was given to ''Residentie [[Aceh|Atjeh]]''. Then in 1914, ''Gouvernement Sumatra's Westkust'', was demoted to ''Residentie Sumatra's Westkust'', and added the [[Mentawai Islands Regency|Mentawai Islands]] region in the Indian Ocean into ''Residentie Sumatra's Westkust,'' and in 1935 the Kerinci region was also incorporated into ''Residentie Sumatra's Westkust.'' After the breakdown of the ''Gouvernement Sumatra's Oostkust'', the [[Rokan Hulu Regency|Rokan Hulu]] and [[Kuantan Singingi Regency|Kuantan Singingi]] regions were given to ''Residentie [[Riau|Riouw]]'', and ''Residentie [[Jambi|Djambi]]'' was also formed in almost the same period.<ref name="Gusti" />

=== Japanese occupation and Independence ===
{{Main|Japanese occupation of West Sumatra}}
During the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese occupation]], ''Residentie Sumatra's Westkust'' changed its name to ''Sumatora Nishi Kaigan Shu''. On the basis of military geo-strategy, the [[Kampar Regency|Kampar]] area was separated from ''Sumatora Nishi Kaigan Shu'' and incorporated into the territory of ''Rhio Shu''.

At the beginning of [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesian independence]] in 1945, the West Sumatra region was incorporated in the Sumatra province based in [[Bukittinggi]]. Four years later, Sumatra Province was divided into three provinces: [[North Sumatra]], [[Central Sumatra]], and [[South Sumatra]]. West Sumatra, Riau and Jambi were part of the residency within the province of Central Sumatra. During the [[Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia|PRRI]] rebellion, based on emergency law number 19 of 1957, Central Sumatra Province was further divided into three provinces: West Sumatra Province, Riau Province, and Jambi Province. The Kerinci region which was previously incorporated in the South Sumatra Regency of [[Kerinci Regency|Kerinci]], was incorporated into Jambi Province as a separate regency. Likewise, the [[Kampar Regency|Kampar]], [[Rokan Hulu Regency|Rokan Hulu]] and [[Kuantan Singingi Regency|Kuantan Singingi]] areas are designated as part of Riau Province.

==Geography==
West Sumatra lies in the middle of the western coast of [[Sumatra]], and has an area of 42,119.54&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Geographic features include [[plain]]s, mountainous volcanic highlands formed by the [[Barisan Mountains|Barisan]] mountain range that runs from north-west to south-east, and an offshore island archipelago called the [[Mentawai Islands Regency|Mentawai Islands]]. The West Sumatran coastline faces the Indian Ocean and stretches 375&nbsp;km from [[North Sumatra]] province in the north-west to [[Bengkulu]] in the south-east. The lakes of West Sumatra include: [[Lake Maninjau|Maninjau]] (99.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), [[Lake Singkarak|Singkarak]] (130.1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), [[Lake Diatas|Diatas]] (31.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), [[Lake Dibawah|Dibawah]] (14.0&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and [[Lake Talang|Talang]] (5.0&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). Most of the rivers in West Sumatra flow into the [[Strait of Malacca]], include: [[Batang Hari River|Batanghari]], [[Kampar River|Kampar]], [[Ombilin River|Ombilin]] and [[Sinamar River|Sinamar]], and others flow into the Indian Ocean, include: [[Kuranji River|Kuranji]], [[Anai River|Anai]] and [[Arau River|Arau]]. The mountains and volcanoes of West Sumatra include: [[Mount Kerinci|Kerinci]] (3,805 m), [[Mount Talakmau|Talakmau]] (2,912 m), [[Mount Marapi|Marapi]] (2,891 m), [[Mount Singgalang|Singgalang]] (2,877 m), [[Mount Talang|Talang]] (2,572 m), [[Mount Tandikat|Tandikat]] (2,438 m) and [[Mount Sago|Sago]] (2,271 m).

West Sumatra is one of the earthquake-prone areas in Indonesia, due to its location in the tectonic slab located between the confluence of two major continental plates (the [[Eurasian Plate]] and [[Indo-Australian Plate]]) and [[Great Sumatran fault]],<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sieh |first=Kerry |author2=Danny Natawidjaja |author2-link=Danny Hilman Natawidjaja |date=2000 |title=Neotectonics of the Sumatran fault, Indonesia |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |language=en |volume=105 |issue=B12 |pages=28295–28326 |bibcode=2000JGR...10528295S |doi=10.1029/2000JB900120 |doi-access=free|hdl=10220/8470 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> plus the activity of the active volcanoes. Large earthquakes that occurred recently in West Sumatra earthquake were the [[2009 Sumatra earthquake]] and the [[2010 Mentawai earthquake and tsunami]]. The area was also affected by the [[2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami]].

=== Climate ===
This region has a [[tropical monsoon climate]], similar to most other Indonesian provinces. Throughout the year the province is only affected by two seasons, namely the rainy season and the dry season. The air temperature varies from 24.7 to 32.9 degrees Celsius with air humidity levels ranging from 82% to 88%. The relative rainy season falls from October to April. Variation in rainfall ranges from 2,100&nbsp;mm to 3,264&nbsp;mm. The month December is the month with the most rainfall. While the dry season usually starts in June to September.

The season in West Sumatra is similar to other regions in Indonesia, only known for two seasons, namely the dry season and the rainy season. From June to September wind flows from Australia and do not contain much water vapor, resulting in a dry season. Conversely in December to March many wind currents contain water vapor from Asia and the Pacific Ocean during the rainy season. Such conditions occur every half-year after passing the transition period in between April – May and October – November.

The city of Padang is one of Indonesia's wettest cities, with frequent rainfall throughout the course of the year.{{Weather box|location=Padang|single line=Yes|metric first=Yes|Jan record high C=33.9|Feb record high C=34.4|Mar record high C=33.9|Apr record high C=33.3|May record high C=33.9|Jun record high C=33.9|Jul record high C=33.3|Aug record high C=33.3|Sep record high C=32.8|Oct record high C=33.3|Nov record high C=32.8|Dec record high C=32.8|year record high C=34.4|Jan high C=30.6|Feb high C=31.7|Mar high C=31.7|Apr high C=31.7|May high C=32.2|Jun high C=32.2|Jul high C=31.7|Aug high C=32.2|Sep high C=32.2|Oct high C=31.7|Nov high C=31.1|Dec high C=30.6|year high C=31.6|Jan mean C=27.0|Feb mean C=27.0|Mar mean C=27.0|Apr mean C=27.2|May mean C=27.5|Jun mean C=27.0|Jul mean C=25.0|Aug mean C=25.0|Sep mean C=26.7|Oct mean C=26.7|Nov mean C=26.7|Dec mean C=26.7|year mean C=26.6|Jan low C=23.3|Feb low C=24.4|Mar low C=23.9|Apr low C=23.9|May low C=23.9|Jun low C=23.9|Jul low C=23.3|Aug low C=23.3|Sep low C=23.9|Oct low C=23.9|Nov low C=23.9|Dec low C=23.9|year low C=23.8|Jan record low C=21.1|Feb record low C=20.6|Mar record low C=21.1|Apr record low C=21.7|May record low C=21.7|Jun record low C=20.0|Jul record low C=21.1|Aug record low C=20.6|Sep record low C=21.1|Oct record low C=21.1|Nov record low C=21.1|Dec record low C=21.1|year record low C=20.0|precipitation colour=green|Jan precipitation mm=351|Feb precipitation mm=259|Mar precipitation mm=307|Apr precipitation mm=363|May precipitation mm=315|Jun precipitation mm=307|Jul precipitation mm=277|Aug precipitation mm=348|Sep precipitation mm=352|Oct precipitation mm=495|Nov precipitation mm=518|Dec precipitation mm=480|year precipitation mm=4172|Jan sun=175|Feb sun=181|Mar sun=175|Apr sun=188|May sun=200|Jun sun=206|Jul sun=200|Aug sun=186|Sep sun=136|Oct sun=135|Nov sun=167|Dec sun=167|year sun=2116|source 1=Sistema de Clasificación Bioclimática Mundial<ref name=climate>{{cite web

{{notelist}}As in most other province of Indonesia, West Sumatra has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Af'') bordering on a tropical monsoon climate. The climate is very much dictated by the surrounding sea and the prevailing wind system. It has high average temperature and high average rainfall.

=== Flora and Fauna ===
The province includes large areas of dense tropical forest, which is home to a host of species including: ''[[Rafflesia arnoldii]]'' (world's largest flower), [[Sumatran tiger]], [[siamang]], [[Malayan tapir]], [[goat antelope|Sumatran serow]], [[rusa deer]], [[sun bear|Malayan sun bear]], [[Bornean clouded leopard]], and many birds and butterflies.
 
The province includes two national parks: [[Siberut National Park]] and [[Kerinci Seblat National Park]], as well as a number of nature reserves: Rimbo Panti Nature Reserve, Batang Palupuh Nature Reserve, Lembah Anai Nature Reserve, Lembah Harau Nature Reserve, Bung Hatta Grand Forest Park, and Beringin Sakti Nature Reserve.

== Government ==
The Province of West Sumatra is led by a governor who is elected directly with his representative for a 5-year term. In addition to being a regional government, the Governor also acts as a representative or extension of the central government in the province, whose authority is regulated in Law No. 32 of 2004 and Government Regulation number 19 of 2010.

While the relationship between the provincial government and the regency and city governments is not a sub-ordinate, each of these regional governments governs and manages government affairs according to the principle of autonomy and co-administration.

=== Nagari ===
[[File:Seribu Rumah Gadang.jpg|thumb|300px|Minangkabau settlement in Nagari Koto Baru, now known as Seribu Rumah Gadang.]]
Until 1979, the smallest administrative unit in West Sumatra was called a ''[[Nagari (settlement)|nagari]]'', which had existed before [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesian independence]]. With the enactment of Law No. 5 of 1979 concerning village governance, the status of nagari was eliminated and replaced with villages, and several jorong statuses were upgraded to villages. The position of nagari guardians was also removed and government administration was carried out by village heads. But since the onset of [[Post-Suharto era|government reform]] and regional autonomy, since 2001, the term ''nagari'' has been used again in this province.

The political culture that lived in the West Sumatra village government since the policy of uniformity (Law No.5 of 1979) was applied to the parochial political culture. this condition is seen through the power system, the ruling system, the terms of the ruler, and the role of the ruler in the village government.

The kinship system in developing participant political culture began to shift, in terms of the level of sensitivity, the form of tolerance in kinship, and the role of seniority in kinship. This means that the lack of togetherness in the kinship power system.

Nagari government is an autonomous government structure, has a clear territory and adheres to adat as a regulator of the life of its members. the regency replaced the term village government that was used previously. Whereas for the nagari in the city government system still as a traditional institution, it has not become part of the regional government structure.

Opportunities that occur in village government are the emergence of individualistic economic growth. This condition is a result of dependence on the central government, resulting in lack of independence. This condition can weaken the resilience of the area of the economy itself. However, now the villages of West Sumatra have tried to build efforts to facilitate the political policies of the village government or since exchanging back into nagari, namely changing the structure and process between village government structures made under Law No. 5 of 1979.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/36066594|title=Review UU Nomor 5 Tahun 1979 dan UU Nomor 22 Tahun 1999 Relasi Vertikal dan Horizontal Desa|last=Azizi|first=Ahmad Naufal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210924131944/https://www.academia.edu/36066594|language=en|access-date=2019-03-23|archive-date=2021-09-24|url-status=live}}</ref>

''Nagari'' was initially led jointly by the princes or ''datuk'' in the ''nagari'', then during the [[Dutch East Indies]] government one of the princes was chosen to become the guardian of the Nagari. Then in running the government, the nagari guardians are assisted by a number of jorong or jorong guardians, but now assisted by the ''nagari'' secretary and civil servants depending on the needs of each ''nagari''. This ''nagari'' guardian was chosen by the ''anak nagari'' (nagari residents) democratically in direct elections for 6 years in office.

As a new regency, Dharmasraya got the highest score (59.43) from a possible 100 among other new regencies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/04/26/awards-note-progress-regional-autonomy.html|title=Awards note progress in regional autonomy|last1=Indrasafitri|first1=Dina|last2=Sufa|first2=Theresia|work=[[The Jakarta Post]]|date=April 26, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427045555/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/04/26/awards-note-progress-regional-autonomy.html|archive-date=April 27, 2011}}</ref>

Before the reforms of 1999 and the implementation of regional autonomy in 2001, the lowest local government unit under the district administrations was the Javanese model of the village, the ''[[Village (Indonesia)|desa]]''. Under regional autonomy, the traditional Minangkabau ''[[Nagari (settlement)|nagari]]'', which are larger than villages elsewhere in Indonesia, have been reintroduced in place of the ''desa''.<ref>Franz and Keebet von Benda-Beckmann, "Recentralization and Decentralization in West Sumatra," in Holtzappel and Ramstedt (eds.), ''Decentralization and Regional Autonomy in Indonesia: Implementation and Challenges'', Singapore and Leiden, 2009, pp. 233ff. at 302.</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Sasdi|first=Ardimas|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/yesterdaydetail.asp?fileid=20030108.F02|title=West Sumatra reinvents its original roots|work=The Jakarta Post|date=January 25, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125094822/http://www.thejakartapost.com/yesterdaydetail.asp?fileid=20030108.F02|archive-date=January 25, 2008}}</ref>

West Sumatra is the native homeland of Minangkabau people. They speak [[Minangkabau language]] and predominantly [[Muslim]]. West Sumatran have historically played the important role within the Muslim community in Indonesia.<ref>Giap, Tan Khee et al. ''Competitiveness Analysis And Development Strategies For 33 Indonesian Provinces''. World Scientific.</ref> Up until today the region is considered one of the strongholds of Islam in Indonesia. They have a reputation as traders, intellectuals as well as politically savvy people who have successfully exported their culture, language, cuisine and beliefs throughout Indonesia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/indonesia/west-sumatra/introduction|title=West Sumatra|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|access-date=February 28, 2017|archive-date=June 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617002233/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/indonesia/west-sumatra/introduction|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Mentawai people|Mentawaians]] live on the Mentawai Islands, off the western coast of Sumatra, that are also part of the native people of province. They speak [[Mentawai language]]s, which are not intelligible with either Indonesian nor Minangkabau. Small minority of the Mentawais are Christians nowadays. In the Mentawai Islands, where the majority of the population is Mentawai, it is rare to find Minangkabau people. [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese Indonesian]] are only found in big cities, such as Padang, Bukittinggi, and Payakumbuh. In Padang and Pariaman, there are also small numbers of [[Nias people|Nias]] and [[Tamils|Tamil people]].<ref>http://www.jambi-independent.co.id {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190314044934/https://jambi-independent.co.id/ |date=2019-03-14 }} [http://www.jambi-independent.co.id/jio/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4331:kampung-keling-tempat-tinggal-muslim-india-di-pariaman-dan-padang&catid=25:nasional&Itemid=29 Kampung Keling, Tempat Tinggal Muslim India di Pariaman dan Padang]{{Dead link|date=March 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

=== Language ===
The language used in everyday life in West Sumatra is the [[Minangkabau language]] which has several dialects, such as the Bukittinggi dialect, Pariaman dialect, South Coastal dialect, and Payakumbuh dialect. In the Pasaman and West Pasaman regions bordering North Sumatra, the Batak Mandailing dialect is also spoken. Meanwhile, in the Mentawai archipelago, the [[Mentawai language]] is widely used. [[Tamil language|Tamil]] is spoken by Tamils in Padang.

[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] is widely understood as a second-language. It is used as the language of education as well as interethnic communication.

=== Religion ===
{{Main|Islam in West Sumatra}}
[[Islam]] is the majority religion adopted by 97% of the population of West Sumatra. Christians, concentrated in the [[Mentawai Islands Regency|Mentawai Islands]], number around 2.2%, Buddhists are around 0.26%, and Hindus are around 0.01%, the two latter being adopted by immigrant communities.

Various places of worship, which are dominated by mosques and musallas, can be found in every district and city in West Sumatra. The largest mosque is the Grand Mosque of West Sumatra [[Grand Mosque of West Sumatra]] in Padang. The oldest mosques include the [[Ganting Grand Mosque]] in [[Padang]] and the [[Tuo Kayu Jao Mosque]] in [[Solok Regency]]. The typical Minangkabau architecture dominates both the form of the mosque and the musala. The [[Grand Mosque of West Sumatra]] has a gonjong-shaped building, decorated with Minang carvings and calligraphy. There is also a mosque with a roof consisting of several levels, which are getting smaller and more concave.

=== Traditional music ===
The nuances of Minangkabau in every West Sumatra music mixed with any type of music at this time will definitely be seen from every song that circulates in the community. This is because Minang music can be formulated with any kind of music that makes it pleasant to hear and acceptable to the public. The musical elements giving the nuance consist of traditional musical instruments, ''[[saluang]]'', ''bansi'', ''[[talempong]]'', [[Rebab|''rabab'']], ''pupuik'', ''serunai'', and ''gandang tabuik''.

There is also a ''saluang jo dendang'', which is the delivery of chanting accompanied by ''[[saluang]]'', also known as ''sijobang''.<ref>Phillips, Nigel, (1981), ''Sijobang: sung narrative poetry of West Sumatra'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-23737-6}}.</ref>

Minangkabau music in the form of instrumental and songs from this area are generally melancholy. This is closely related to the structure of the community which has a sense of brotherhood, kinship relations and love of a high homeland supported by the habit of going abroad.

The music industry in West Sumatra is growing with the emergence of Minangkabau artists who can blend modern music into traditional Minangkabau music. The development of modern Minang music in West Sumatra dates back to the 1950s, marked by the birth of the Gumarang Orchestra. Elly Kasim, Tiar Ramon and Nurseha are well-known West Sumatra singers in the 1970s to the present. At present the singers, songwriters and music stylists in West Sumatra are under the auspices of the PAPPRI organization (Association of Indonesian Singer Music Songwriters) and PARMI (Indonesian Minang Artist Association).

Record companies in West Sumatra that support the Minang music industry include: Tanama Record, Planet Record, Pitunang Record, Sinar Padang Record, Caroline Record located in [[Padang]] and Minang Record, Gita Virma Record located in [[Bukittinggi]].

=== Traditional dance ===
Broadly speaking, dance from West Sumatra is from the customs of the [[Minangkabau people]] and the [[Mentawai people]]. The peculiarities of Minangkabau dance are generally influenced by the Islamic religion, the uniqueness of matrilineal customs and the habit of migrating their communities also give a great influence on the soul of a classical dance that is classic, including ''tari pasambah'', ''[[Tari Piring]]'', ''tari payung'', and the ''tari indang''. Meanwhile, there is also a performance typical of other Minangkabau ethnic groups in the form of a unique blend of martial arts called ''[[Pencak Silat|silek]]'' with dancing, singing and acting known as ''[[Randai]]''.<ref>Pauka K., (1998), ''Theater and martial arts in West Sumatra: Randai and silek of the Minangkabau'', Ohio University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-89680-205-6}}.</ref>

As for the typical Mentawai people dance is called ''Turuk Laggai''. This ''Turuk Langai'' dance generally tells about animal behavior, so the title is adjusted to the names of the animals, for example ''tari burung'' (bird), ''tari monyet'' (monkey), ''tari ayam'' (chicken), ''tari ular'' (snake) and so on.<ref>http://www.indosiar.com {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816181706/http://www.indosiar.com/ |date=2018-08-16 }} [http://www.indosiar.com/ragam/86393/sajian-tarian-khas-mentawai Sajian Tarian Khas Mentawai] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626160111/http://www.indosiar.com/ragam/86393/sajian-tarian-khas-mentawai |date=2010-06-26 }} (diakses pada 25 juli 2010)</ref>

The traditional house of West Sumatra, especially from the [[Minangkabau people]], is called ''[[Rumah Gadang]]''. The ''[[rumah Gadang]]'' is usually built on a plot of land belonging to the parent family in the tribe and people from generation to generation.<ref name="Graves, Elizabeth E. 2007">Graves, Elizabeth E., (2007), ''Asal usul elite Minangkabau modern: respons terhadap kolonial Belanda abad XIX/XX'', Jakarta:Yayasan Obor Indonesia, {{ISBN|978-979-461-661-1}}.</ref> Not far from the ''rumah gadang'' complex is usually also built a ''[[surau]]'' that functions as a place of worship and a place of residence for unmarried adult men. The ''rumah gadang'' is made in the form of a rectangle and is divided into two front and rear parts, generally made of wood, and at first glance it looks like a stilt house with a distinctive roof, prominent like a buffalo horn, the local people call it ''Gonjong'' and the roof was formerly made from palm fiber before changing to a zinc roof.<ref>Azinar Sayuti, Rifai Abu, (1985), ''Sistem ekonomi tradisional sebagai perwujudan tanggapan aktif manusia terhadap lingkungan daerah Sumatra Barat'', hlm. 202, Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, Proyek Inventarisasi dan Dokumentasi Kebudayaan Daerah.</ref> This ''rumag Bagonjong'' according to the local community was inspired by the''Tambo'', which tells of the arrival of their ancestors by boat from the sea. Another distinctive feature of this traditional house is not using iron nails but using wooden pegs, but strong enough as a binder.<ref>Navis, A.A., ''Cerita Rakyat dari Sumatra Barat 3'', Grasindo, {{ISBN|979-759-551-X}}.</ref><ref>''Mengenal Rumah Adat, Pakaian Adat, Tarian Adat, Dan Senjata Tradisional'', PT Niaga Swadaya, {{ISBN|979-788-145-8}}.</ref>

While the [[Mentawai people]] also have a traditional house in the form of a large stilt house with a floor height of up to one meter of land called ''uma.''<ref>Schefold R., (1991), ''Mainan bagi roh: kebudayaan Mentawai'', PT Balai Pustaka, {{ISBN|979-407-274-5}}.</ref> ''Uma'' is inhabited jointly by five to ten families. In general, this uma construction was built without the use of nails, but it was cooked with wood and a cross-linking system.

Various other types of weapons have also been used such as spears, long swords, arrows, chopsticks and so on.

[[Padang cuisine|Padang food]] is the cuisine of the [[Minangkabau people]]. Padang food is famous for its rich taste of succulent [[coconut milk]] and spicy chili.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/05/16/marco%E2%80%99s-bofet-authentic-padang-food.html|title=Marco's Bofet: Authentic Padang food|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914204100/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/05/16/marco%E2%80%99s-bofet-authentic-padang-food.html|archive-date=2010-09-14|url-status=dead|access-date=2010-09-22}}</ref> Minang cuisine put much emphasis in three elements; ''[[gulai]]'' (curry), ''lado'' ([[chili pepper]]) and ''bareh'' (rice).

Because most Minangkabau people are [[Muslim]]s, Minangkabau cuisine follows [[halal]] dietary law rigorously. Protein intake are mostly taken from beef, water buffalo, goat, lamb meat, and poultry and fish. Minangkabau people are known for their fondness of cattle meat products including [[offal]]. Almost all the parts of a cattle, such as meat, [[rib]]s, [[tongue]], [[tail]], [[Liver (food)|liver]], [[tripe]], brain, [[bone marrow]], [[spleen]], [[intestine]], [[cartilage]], [[tendon]], and skin are made to be Minangkabau delicacies. Seafood is popular in coastal West Sumatran cities, and most are grilled or fried with spicy chili sauce or in curry gravy. Fish, shrimp, and cuttlefish are cooked in similar fashion. Most of Minangkabau food is eaten with hot steamed rice or compressed rice such as ''katupek'' ([[ketupat]]). Vegetables are mostly boiled such as boiled [[cassava]] leaf, or simmered in thin curry as side dishes, such as [[gulai]] of young [[jackfruit]] or cabbages.

In Padang food establishments, it is common to eat with one's hands. They usually provide ''kabasuah'', a bowl of tap water with a slice of [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] in it to give a fresh scent. This water is used to wash one's hands before and after eating. If a customer does not wish to eat with bare hands, it is acceptable to ask for a [[spoon]] and [[fork]].

[[File:Rendang daging sapi asli Padang.JPG|Authentic Minangkabau rendang is dark in colour, served with ''[[ketupat]]''|thumb]]

The cuisine is usually cooked once per day. To have ''[[Nasi Padang]]'' in restaurants customers choose from those dishes, which are left on display in high-stacked plates in the windows. During a dine-in ''hidang'' (serve) style Padang restaurant, after the customers are seated, they do not have to order. The waiter immediately serves the dishes directly to the table, and the table will quickly be set with dozens of small dishes filled with highly flavored foods such as beef [[rendang]], curried fish, stewed [[Greens (vegetable)|greens]], chili [[eggplant]], curried beef [[liver]], [[tripe]], intestines, or foot [[tendons]], fried beef [[lung]], fried [[Chicken as food|chicken]], and of course, [[sambal]], the spicy sauces ubiquitous at Indonesian tables.

''[[Soto Padang]]'' (crispy beef in spicy soup) is local residents' breakfast favorite, meanwhile ''sate'' (beef [[satay]] in [[curry]] sauce served with [[ketupat]]) is a treat in the evening.

The serving style is different in ''[[Nasi Kapau]]'' food stalls, a Minangkabau [[Bukittinggi]] style. After the customer is seated, he or she is asked which dishes they desire. The chosen dishes will be put directly upon the steamed rice or in separate small plates.

There are myriad Padang food establishments throughout Indonesia and the region, according to ''Ikatan Warung Padang Indonesia'' (Iwapin) or Warung Padang Bonds. In Greater [[Jakarta]] alone there are at least 20,000 Padang restaurant establishments.<ref>[http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0305/25/latar/331202.htm Harian Kompas, 25 May 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615154827/http://www2.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0305/25/latar/331202.htm|date=15 June 2009}}</ref> Several notable Minangkabau [[restaurant chain]]s are Sederhana, Garuda, Pagi Sore, Simpang Raya, Sari Ratu, Sari Minang, Payakumbuah and Natrabu.

The importance of Padang food establishments (''[[warung]]'' or ''rumah makan'' Padang) for Indonesian workers' lunch break in urban areas, was demonstrated in 2016; when Jakarta municipal civil servants demanded the raise of ''uang lauk pauk'' (food allowance, as a component of civil servant's salary), following the raise of ''[[Nasi Padang]]'' price in Greater Jakarta area.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://metrobatam.com/gara-gara-nasi-padang-belanja-negara-terpaksa-ditambah/|title=Gara-gara Nasi Padang, Belanja Negara Terpaksa Ditambah|date=5 October 2016|newspaper=Metro Batam|language=id|access-date=23 March 2019|archive-date=23 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323162134/http://metrobatam.com/gara-gara-nasi-padang-belanja-negara-terpaksa-ditambah/|url-status=live}}</ref>
