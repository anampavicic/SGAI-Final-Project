==History==

The city of Grand Prairie was first established as '''Dechman''' by Alexander McRae Dechman in 1863. He based the name of the town on [[Big Prairie, Ohio]]. Prior to then, he resided in [[Young County, Texas|Young County]] near [[Fort Belknap (Texas)|Fort Belknap]]. The 1860 U.S. Federal Census—Slave Schedules shows an A McR Dechman as having four slaves, ages 50, 25, 37 and 10. Dechman learned that he could trade his oxen and wagons for land in Dallas County. In 1863, Dechman bought {{convert|239.5|acre}} of land on the eastern side of the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]] and {{convert|100|acre}} of timber land on the west side of the river for a broken-down wagon, oxen team and [[United States dollar|US$]]200 in [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] money. He tried to establish a home on the property, but ran into difficulties, so he returned to his family in Birdville before joining in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. In 1867, Dechman filed a town plat with Dallas County, consisting of {{convert|50|acre}}.{{citation needed|date=October 2024}}

After the war, Dechman returned to Birdville for two years before selling that farm in 1867 and moving to [[Houston]], where [[yellow fever]] broke out, causing the family to settle in [[Bryan, Texas|Bryan]]. In 1876, Dechman traded half his "prairie" property to the T&P Railroad to ensure the railroad came through the town. The railroad named the depot "Dechman", prompting its namesake to relocate his home from Bryan to Dechman. His son Alexander had been living in Dechman and operating a trading post and farm. The first church in the area was the Good Hope Cumberland Sabbath School, established in 1870 by Rev. Andrew Hayter. The church was later renamed West Fork [[United Presbyterian Church of North America|United Presbyterian Church]] and remains an active church.<ref>Texas State Historical Marker 5760</ref>

The first U.S. [[post office]] opened in 1877 under the name "Deckman" rather than "Dechman", because the [[U.S. Postal Service]] could not read the writing on the form completed to open the post office. Later that same year, after the Postal Service had adopted the "Deckman" name, confusion resulted from the T&P Railroad designation "Grand Prairie". This name was based on maps drawn from around 1850 through 1858 that labeled the area between Dallas and Fort Worth "the grand prairie of Texas". In order to alleviate the confusion, the Postal Service named the post office "Grand Prairie".

The town of Grand Prairie was eventually [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a city in 1909. During [[World War I]] and since, Grand Prairie has had a long history with the defense and aviation industry. While the present-day [[Vought]] plant on Jefferson Avenue is part of a small strip within the Dallas city limits, it was originally in Grand Prairie. During [[World War II]], the [[North American Aviation]] Plant B produced the [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] and the [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51C and K Mustang]] variants. After the war, Vought Aircraft took over the plant. This later became [[Ling-Temco-Vought]] (LTV), then eventually returned to the Vought moniker. The plant was the production site for the [[F-8 Crusader]] and the [[A-7 Corsair II]] aircraft of the 1950–1989 time period. The LTV Missile and Space division produced missiles such as the [[Scout (rocket family)|Scout]] and [[M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System|MLRS]]. This division was eventually sold to [[Lockheed Martin]], which continues to operate in Grand Prairie. Grand Prairie was also the North American headquarters for [[Aérospatiale]] Helicopter. This company eventually became [[American Eurocopter|Airbus Helicopters, Inc.]], the U.S. subsidiary of [[Airbus Helicopters]].

In 1953, the mayor and city council of Grand Prairie attempted to annex nearly {{convert|70|sqmi|km2}} of then-unincorporated and largely undeveloped land in southern Dallas and Tarrant counties. Vehement debate ensued, and the legal pressure from cities such as [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]], [[Duncanville, Texas|Duncanville]] and [[Irving, Texas|Irving]] wound up overturning part of the annexation attempt.

==Geography==
Grand Prairie is located along the border between Tarrant and Dallas counties, with a small portion extending south into Ellis County. The city is bordered by [[Dallas]] to the east, [[Cedar Hill, Texas|Cedar Hill]] and [[Midlothian, Texas|Midlothian]] to the southeast, [[Mansfield, Texas|Mansfield]] to the southwest, [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]] to the west, [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] to the northwest, and [[Irving, Texas|Irving]] to the north.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|210.0|sqkm|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|186.8|sqkm|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|23.3|sqkm|order=flip}}, or 11.08%, is water.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov |title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Grand Prairie city, Texas |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=November 30, 2011 }}</ref>

The West Fork of the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]] and a major tributary, [[Johnson Creek (Texas)|Johnson Creek]], flow through Grand Prairie.

Grand Prairie has a long history of flooding from Johnson Creek. In the 1980s, a major [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] project was begun to straighten the channel, which has reduced the damage of flooding.

=====Arlington Independent School District=====

The Arlington ISD has the second highest portion of Grand Prairie's K–12 student population. Six Arlington ISD elementary schools are within the city limits of Grand Prairie. Grand Prairie residents in the Arlington ISD are located generally west of the Dallas-Tarrant County boundary and north of the intersection of Camp Wisdom and Lake Ridge in southwest Grand Prairie. One of the Arlington high schools, [[Bowie High School (Arlington, Texas)|James Bowie High]], has more Grand Prairie residents than Arlington residents that are students at the school.

Grand Prairie student/residents in the Arlington ISD attend Bowie, [[Sam Houston High School (Arlington, Texas)|Sam Houston]], or [[Lamar High School (Arlington, Texas)|Lamar High School]] in the Arlington ISD and their feeder elementary schools and junior high schools.

=====Mansfield Independent School District=====

The Mansfield ISD contains the third highest portion of the Grand Prairie's K–12 student population. Grand Prairie residents in the Mansfield ISD are located generally south of the intersection of Camp Wisdom and Lake Ridge, and west of Joe Pool Lake to the Tarrant and Ellis County line in southwest Grand Prairie. Three Mansfield ISD schools, Anna May Daulton Elementary; Louise Cabaniss Elementary; and Cora Spencer Elementary, are currently open within the city limits of Grand Prairie. The Mansfield ISD is the fastest growing ISD in Tarrant County, and the population growth in far southwest Grand Prairie is a major factor in the Mansfield ISD's subsequent growth.

Grand Prairie students/residents in the Mansfield ISD attend [[Mansfield Timberview High School]], [[Lake Ridge High School]] or [[Mansfield High School (Mansfield, Texas)|Mansfield High School]] in the Mansfield ISD or their feeder elementaries and middle schools. Timberview High School is located on [[Texas State Highway 360|State Highway 360]] less than {{convert|100|yd}} from the Grand Prairie city line.

[[Interstate highway]]s [[Interstate 20 in Texas|20]] and [[Interstate 30|30]] run east–west through the northern and southern parts of the city. [[Texas State Highway]]s [[Texas State Highway Spur 303|Spur 303]] (named '''Pioneer Parkway''') and [[Texas State Highway 180|180]] ('''Main Street''') also run east–west in the northern and central portions of the city.

[[Texas State Highway 360|SH 360]] runs for almost three miles in the northwestern portion of city; most of the highway runs just west of the city limits in [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]].

[[Texas State Highway 161|SH 161]], named the '''President George Bush Turnpike''', runs north–south through western Grand Prairie. The main lanes were opened in late 2012 with frontage roads open since 2010. Portions of the highway located north of [[Texas State Highway|SH 180]] are depressed while the portion south of SH 180 runs at-grade then becomes elevated. Frontage roads remain at-grade throughout. The frontage road intersection at Main Street will open sometime in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ntta.org/roadsprojects/projprog/pgbtwestext/Pages/default.aspx|title=PGBT Western Extension (PGBT WE)|website=Ntta.org|access-date=27 August 2017}}</ref>

[[Belt Line Road (Texas)|Belt Line Road]] is a major north–south thoroughfare in the city.

The section of the road north of Main Street keeps its name, continuing north into [[Irving, Texas|Irving]].

The city declined membership in 1984. In April 2022, Grand Prairie launched "[[Via Transportation|Via]] Grand Prairie", an "on-demand, shared public transportation" which connects to [[DART light rail|DART's]] [[West Irving station]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Grand Prairie Launches Shared Public Transportation 'Via Rideshare' |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/grand-prairie-launches-shared-public-transportation-e2-80-98via-rideshare/ar-AAWcyQy |access-date=2022-04-21 |website=MSN |language=en-US}}</ref>

In the era of private operation of passenger trains prior to the onset of the [[Amtrak]] era in 1971, [[Texas and Pacific Railway]] trains such as the ''[[Texas Eagle (MP train)|Texas Eagle]]'' and the ''Louisiana Eagle'' made stops in Grand Prairie, on trips between [[Fort Worth]] and [[Dallas]].<ref>[http://www.streamlinerschedules.com/concourse/track9/texeagle196706.html 1967 schedule of the ''Texas Eagle''] ''Streamliner Schedules'', from the ''Official Guide of the Railways''</ref><ref>[http://www.streamlinerschedules.com/concourse/track9/louisianaeagle195208.html 1952 schedule of the ''Louisiana Eagle''], ''Streamliner Schedules'', from the ''Official Guide of the Railways''</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Missouri Pacific Lines, Table 1 |journal=Official Guide of the Railways|publisher=National Railway Publication Company |volume=102 |issue=12 |date=May 1970}}</ref> Amtrak's ''[[Texas Eagle]]'' (Chicago-San Antonio) makes stops at [[Dallas Union Station]] 12 miles to the east.
