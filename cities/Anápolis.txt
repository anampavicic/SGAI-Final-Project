==Etymology==
''Anápolis'' means "city of Ana" in [[Greek language|Greek]] (Ana + ''polis'', city).

==History==
The settlement began in the 18th century, due to the travels of the drovers to the region of gold mines in the nearby towns. Some of the travelers, when they did not find any more precious metals, decided to settle in the thorp. The first historical registry was written in 1819, when the French naturalist and traveler Auguste de Saint-Hillaire, traveling from Bonfim ([[Silvânia]]) towards Meia-Ponte ([[Pirenópolis]]), stays in the region called [[Tapir|Tapirs']] Farm. This name is due to the abundance of this animal in the region. The first official document was written on April 25, 1870, when a group of residents made a donation of some parts of their lands to the Our Lady of [[Saint Anne]] Patrimony.<ref name="PrefeituraHist">{{cite web|url=http://www.anapolis.go.gov.br/portal/anapolis/historia-da-cidade|title=História de Anápolis|publisher=Prefeitura de Anápolis|access-date=2013-07-13|archive-date=2013-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707022340/http://www.anapolis.go.gov.br/portal/anapolis/historia-da-cidade/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

According to a local myth, in 1859, Ana das Dores left [[Jaraguá, Goiás|Jaraguá]] towards Bonfim ([[Silvânia]]), on a mule train travel. One of the mules, which was carrying the statue of [[Saint Anne]], got lost. When, the mule was found, it was not willing to move, and das Dores interpreted this as the desire of the Saint to stay there. After she promised to build a chapel in homage to the Saint, the mule started to move again. The erection of the building was done by her son, Gomes de Souza Ramos, eleven years later. In 1872, a document requesting the status of a parish was written. It was carried by Souza Ramos to the provincial president. The pledge was granted and the thorn became a parish on August 6, 1873.<ref name="PrefeituraHist"/><ref name="Diocese">{{cite web|url=http://www.diocesedeanapolis.org.br/2012/diocese-dados-gerais/dados-gerais/breve-historico/2385-cidadedeana.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130714003718/http://www.diocesedeanapolis.org.br/2012/diocese-dados-gerais/dados-gerais/breve-historico/2385-cidadedeana.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-07-14 |title=Anápolis, cidade de Ana - cidade de Sant-Ana |author=Eucarice Sousa Ramos |date=2012-10-18 |publisher=Diocese de Anápolis |access-date=2013-07-13 }}</ref>

José da Silva Batista moved to the region on February 28, 1882, from Meia-Ponte ([[Pirenópolis]]). Seeking greater autonomy, He and Sousa Ramos requested the incorporation of the town, which was granted on December 15, 1887. However, due to some obstacles mainly by the authorities from Meia-Ponte, which was concerned about the loss of taxes, it became a town 'de facto' on March 10, 1892, when Batista was named the president of the administrative board of the Santana das Antas town. The town became a city on July 31, 1907.<ref name="PrefeituraHist"/><ref name="EmancipacaoChiarott"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jornalestadodegoias.com.br/noticias_detalhe.php?id_noticia=2293&&id_editoria=8 |title=Anápolis completa 103 anos com a marca do progresso |publisher=O estado de Goiás |date=2010-07-31 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
