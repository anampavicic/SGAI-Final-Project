=== Early settlement ===
The settlements on the ''Campos de Sant'Ana das Lavras do Funil'' dated from the first half of the 18th century, founded in 1729.<ref name="Costa">{{cite journal|last1=Costa|first1=Firmino|title=História de Lavras|journal=Revista do Arquivo Público Mineiro|date=1911|volume=16|issue= |pages=130–131|url=http://www.siaapm.cultura.mg.gov.br/modules/rapm/brtacervo.php?cid=489&op=1|access-date=January 17, 2016|publisher=Imprensa Oficial de Minas Gerais|location=Belo Horizonte|language=pt}}</ref> The first inhabitants were the [[Paulistas|Paulista]] family of Francisco Bueno da Fonseca ({{circa|1670}}–1752), leader of a revolt against a [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese]] judge in São Paulo in 1712.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Németh-Torres|first1=Geovani|title=De Parnaíba às Lavras do Funil: Subsídios para a História das Origens de Lavras|date=2012|publisher=Geovani Németh-Torres|location=Lavras|language=pt|format=e-book|isbn=978-85-911368-2-7|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwX5b9qAn_fGYnZUMC16bmhDWmM/edit|access-date=January 17, 2016}}</ref> Bueno da Fonseca, his sons and other explorers, settled in the rivers [[:pt:Rio Capivari (Minas Gerais)|Capivari]] and [[Rio Grande (Paraná River)|Grande]] region by 1720<ref>{{cite book|last1=Saint-Adolphe|first1=J.

In 1737 the explorers receive from the Governor Martinho de Mendonça an allotment letter confirming their region occupation, which grew through agriculture and livestock.

On June 18, 1759, [[:pt:Bartolomeu Bueno do Prado|Bartolomeu Bueno do Prado]], [[Bartolomeu Bueno da Silva|Anhangüera]]'s grandson and Francisco Bueno da Fonseca's son-in-law, left the village heading 400 men, summoned from the entire Minas Gerais captaincy, to disrupt the [[quilombo]] confederation of Campo Grande. The influence of [[Captaincy|captain]] Bueno da Fonseca's family contributed to the village's rapid growing. In 1760 they managed to change the [[Freguesia (Portugal)|parish]] seat from [[Carrancas]], as Lavras do Funil already had 1,000 inhabitants, twice more than the former.<ref name="Nemeth2010">{{cite book|last1=Németh-Torres|first1=Geovani|title=Os 250 Anos da Paróquia de Sant'Ana: Uma História da Igreja Católica em Lavras|date=2010|publisher=Geovani Németh-Torres|location=Lavras|isbn=978-85-911368-0-3|url=http://historiadelavras.blogspot.com.br|access-date=January 17, 2016|language=pt}}</ref> In 1813 the village was elevated to [[freguesia]], detaching itself from Carrancas. That time, Lavras had 6 chapels and a population of 10,612 souls.

=== 19th century ===
On the [[Empire of Brazil|Imperial period]], Lavras obtained its political and administrative emancipation, becoming a [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] in 1831 and city in 1868, when there was a change in municipal toponymic from "''Lavras do Funil''" to "''Lavras''".<ref>Provincial Law No. 1510, July 20, 1868.</ref> In 1832 the inspector Manuel Custódio Neto reported to the [[municipal chamber]] that the town consisted of 245 buildings and there was no pavement on its streets. The only public buildings where the [[:pt:Igreja de Nossa Senhora do Rosário (Lavras)|parish church]], and the [[Our Lady of the Rosary|Rosário]] and [[Virgin of Mercy|Mercês]] chapels. Lavras had three private primary schools, with a total of 62 students.<ref name="Costa" /> According to the 1834 census, Lavras had 11,322 inhabitants.<ref name="Vilela">{{cite book|last1=Vilela|first1=Marcio Salviano|title=A Formação Histórica dos Campos de Sant'Ana das Lavras do Funil|date=2007|publisher=Indi|location=Lavras|language=pt}}</ref>

One of the most significant events of this period was the [[Liberal Revolution of 1842]]. For just over a month, between June 14 and July 22, [[:pt:Partido Liberal (Império do Brasil)|liberals]] and [[Conservative Party (Brazil)|conservatives]] kept their barracks in Sant'Ana main square, current Praça Dr. Augusto Silva. The defeated liberals fled or were arrested, subsequently amnestied by the [[Empire of Brazil|imperial government]].<ref name="Vilela" />

=== Golden Age ===
The late nineteenth century and early twentieth century was a time of rapid development in Lavras. On December 18, 1880, it was inaugurated the 208&nbsp;km river navigation between the [[Ribeirão Vermelho]] port (Lavras) and [[Capetinga]] port (municipality of [[Piumhi]]), made by [[steamboat]] "Dr. Jorge". On April 14, 1888, the [[Estrada de Ferro Oeste de Minas]] inaugurated the first station in Ribeirão Vermelho, and, on April 1, 1895, Lavras' city station is inaugurated. Later, in 1911, a tramway was opened, and so Lavras was one of the few cities in Brazilian interior to have this transportation system.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Morrison|first1=Allen|title=The Tramways of Lavras, Minas Gerais state, Brazil|url=http://www.tramz.com/br/lv/lv.html|website=Urban Transport in Latin America|access-date=January 17, 2016|date=April 8, 2012}}</ref>

After the [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|Proclamation of the Republic]], Lavras established itself as a major regional center of Minas Gerais, being the birthplace of [[:pt:Francisco Antônio de Sales|Francisco Salles]], an important politician of the [[República Velha|Old Republic]]. At this time, several colleges were created, such as the Evangelical Institute (founded in 1892 by Samuel Rhea Gammon), the College of Our Lady of Lourdes (founded in 1900 by nuns of the Congregation of the Auxiliary Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy), the Lavras School Group (founded in 1907 by Professor Firmino Costa) and the [[Federal University of Lavras|Agricultural School of Lavras]] (founded in 1908). The quality its education made Lavras to become known as "the city of [[ipê]]s and schools", a slogan created by journalist Jorge Duarte.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Duarte|first1=Jorge|title=Lavras, Terra dos Ipês e das Escolas.|publisher=A Gazeta|date=August 24, 1941|location=Lavras|language=pt}}</ref>

=== Social and political changes ===
Local demographics has been modified with the arrival of many immigrants, representing 1.9% of the population according to Census 1920: the municipality had a total of 806 foreigners, of which 380 were [[Italian Brazilian|Italian]], 189 were [[Portuguese Brazilians|Portuguese]], 166 [[Lebanese Brazilians|Lebanese]], 28 [[Brazilians of Spanish descent|Spaniards]], 20 [[Americans in Brazil|Americans]], 12 [[Austrian Brazilian|Austrians]], five [[French Brazilians|French]], two Russians, one [[Uruguayan Brazilian|Uruguayan]] and three of undetermined nationality.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brasil|title=Recenseamento do Brazil: realizado em 1 de setembro de 1920, população.|date=1926|publisher=Typographia da Estatística|location=Rio de Janeiro|volume=4-1|page=685|url=http://biblioteca.ibge.gov.br/visualizacao/livros/liv6461.pdf|access-date=January 17, 2016|language=pt}}</ref>

The 1920s represented a slowdown in Lavras progress, partly caused by the intense political dispute promoted by two distinct groups: the [[Mineiro Republican Party]], under the new direction of Italian doctor Paulo Menicucci, was favorable to the candidacy of [[Artur Bernardes]] to the [[President of Brazil|Presidency]] and Raul Soares to the [[List of Governors of Minas Gerais|Presidency of Minas Gerais]]; and dissidents, led by Colonel Pedro Sales, supported the respective opposition candidacies of [[Nilo Peçanha]] and Francisco Sales. This dispute became known as between "Doves and Hawks": Doves because of effeminate [[Psychasthenia|psychasthenics]] tics attributed to Bernardes, and Hawks for associating the cleverness, the cunning spirit, and, of course, as one of the little dove predators.<ref name="Vilela" /> Such local clash lasted until the following decade, when it was eclipsed by the new national political order – the [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]].

It was in the mid-twentieth century that Lavras constituted its current geographic boundaries. In its administrative division for the year 1933, the municipality was formed by eight districts: Lavras, [[Carrancas]], [[Ijaci]] (formerly Conceição do Rio Grande), [[Ingaí]], [[Itumirim]] (formerly Rosário), [[Itutinga]] (formerly Santo Antônio da Ponte Nova), [[Luminárias]] (Nossa Senhora do Carmo das Luminárias) and [[Ribeirão Vermelho]]. The municipality has experienced political and administrative separation in 1938, 1943, 1948 and 1962, when their old districts became newly created neighboring municipalities and is currently composed of single district, the urban agglomeration's city.<ref>{{cite book|last1=IBGE|title=Enciclopédia dos Municípios Brasileiros|date=1959|publisher=IBGE|location=Rio de Janeiro|volume=25|pages=443–450|url=http://biblioteca.ibge.gov.br/visualizacao/livros/liv27295_25.pdf|access-date=January 17, 2016|language=pt|chapter=Lavras}}</ref>

=== Progress and stagnation ===
[[File:Contorno Natural.jpg|thumb|Bocaina mountains]] On the populist period during the [[Second Brazilian Republic|Fourth Republic]], Lavras development was signaled by new links with major centers: firstly, it was the inauguration of air transport line, that existed between 1947 and 1960;<ref>{{cite book|last1=Németh-Torres|first1=Geovani|title=A Atenas Mineira: Capítulos Histórico-Culturais de Lavras.|date=2011|publisher=Geovani Németh-Torres|location=Lavras|isbn=978-85-911368-1-0|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y6HmPNu_U5Br0fmL7FlFND_aVUZPsPxIxx4n4S9Zkos2ezNaQX_c9nzUvlgf/view|access-date=January 17, 2016|language=pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Aeroclube de Lavras|title=História|url=http://www.voelavras.com.br/historia|access-date=January 17, 2016|language=pt}}</ref> secondly was the Lavras-[[Rodovia Fernão Dias|Fernão Dias]] patch opening to road traffic in 1962. Another aspect of progress was the inauguration of the Itutinga [[hydroelectric]] power plant in 1955, which increased electricity production and stimulated industrial growth in the city, through the expansion of existing plants and setting up new ventures.

Lavras, in the 1950s, passed by one of its moments of greatest cultural, artistic and sporting wealth thanks to civic associations such as the Lavras Friends Society (Sal) and Lavrense Society of Artistic Culture (Solca). Chroniclers of the time remember several initiatives such as balls, competitions, exhibitions, educational events, theatrical performances, music recitals and poetry, friendly football tournaments and also the formation of a public library and a city museum.<ref name="Vilela" />

In the early 1960s, while the country experienced a period of [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|serious institutional crises]], Lavras suffered a series of attacks made by a [[pyromaniac]], in which several historical houses were consumed by the flames. In this context, in 1962 the local authorities decided the Municipal Theatre demolition, sealing the end of civic organizations and city's cultural decay. This decline was exacerbated in 1963 by the newspaper ''A Gazeta'' disappearance – the only printed weekly at the time – and almost closing of the Agricultural School of Lavras, which was federalized.<ref>Federal Law No. 4,307, December 23, 1963. [http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/1950-1969/L4307.htm Federaliza a Escola Superior de Agricultura de Lavras (ESAL) e dá outras providências] {{in lang|pt}}</ref> Other signs of visible [[Anomie|social degradation]] were the collapse of the Rosary church walls in 1965, rebuilt only in 1970,<ref name="Nemeth2010" /> and the end of the tramway in 1967.

The 1960s and 1970s represented profound changes in Lavras social composition. On one hand, there was the growth of urban areas due to [[rural exodus]]; on the other, it was noted that the city's population growth was below the national average, caused by the phenomenon of [[internal migration]]: as Lavras being economically stagnant, many of its children have moved to other centers looking for better opportunities. Another sign of the municipality weakening was the lack of political representation, which would be broken fourteen years later with the election of Maurício Souza Pádua to the [[Legislative Assembly of Minas Gerais]] in 1983.
