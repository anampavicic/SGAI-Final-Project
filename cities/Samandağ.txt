In February 2023, the town was heavily damaged by [[2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake|powerful earthquakes]].

==Etymology==
Samandağ was formerly known as ''Süveydiye'', ''Yukarı Alevışık'' and ''Levşiye''. It was officially named Samandağ (Seman Dağ, Turkish for Jabal Sem'an: [[Simeon Stylites the Younger|St. Simeon]] Mountain<ref name="Oltean">{{cite journal |last1=Oltean |first1=Daniel |title=From the Monastery of the Theotokos tou Roudiou to Simanaklay?: Greek and Armenian monks in a Changing World |journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers |date=2022 |volume=76 |pages=101–116 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/27172436}}</ref>) in 1948. In Armenian, it was known as ''Svetia'' ({{Lang|hyw|Սվեդիա}}).

==History==
Samandağ lies near the site of the ancient [[Seleucia Pieria]], founded in 300 BC after the [[Persian Empire]] was ousted from the region by [[Seleucus Nicator]], a general of [[Alexander the Great]], in the [[Seleucid]] era that followed Alexander's demise. Seleucia Pieria quickly became a major Mediterranean port of the [[Hellenistic]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] eras, the port of [[Antioch]]. However, it was subject to silting and an earthquake in 526 finally completed its demise as a port.

During the 6th century, Saint [[Simeon Stylites the Younger]] lived on Saman Dağı, a nearby mountain that is also known in Christian sources as the "Wondrous Mountain" or the "Admirable Mountain."<ref name="Della Dora">{{cite book|last=Della Dora|first=Veronica|title=Landscape, Nature, and the Sacred in Byzantium|publication-place=Cambridge|date=2016|isbn=978-1-316-48838-6|oclc=938434170}}</ref>

Samandağ, then called [[Port Saint Symeon|St Symeon]],<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ntMeWddadwAC&pg=PA303|title=Logistics of Warfare in the Age of the Crusades: Proceedings of a Workshop Held at the Centre for Medieval Studies, University of Sydney, 30 September to 4 October 2002|first=John H.|last=Pryor|date=22 September 2018|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|accessdate=22 September 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780754651970}}</ref> became the port of Antioch. The area was conquered by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] in 637 after the [[Battle of the Iron Bridge]] and later it came under the control of the [[Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid]] [[Arab]] dynasties. It was then reconquered by the [[Byzantine]]s under [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] but later conquered by the [[Seljuk Turks]] under general [[Afşin Bey]] after the [[Battle of Manzikert]] which resulted in a disastrous defeat for the [[Byzantine]]s. It played an important role in the capture of the city by the [[Crusaders]] in 1098, to be known as '''Soudin'''. The whole area was known as Svediye, where six villages of [[Armenians]] were located (Bityas, Kabousiye, Haji Habibly, Kheder Beg, Yoghoun Olouk and Vakif) until 1939, the so called "Referendum", when all the Armenian villagers (over 6000) emigrated to Anjar, [[Lebanon]]. Only a small part of Vakif remained and are still in the village, now called [[Vakıflı, Samandağ|Vakıflı]].

== Geography ==
Samandağ itself is a small town, about {{cvt|22|km}} from the city of [[Antakya]]. The local economy depends on fishing and agriculture, especially citrus fruits, and Samandağ has the air of a country market town, with young men buzzing through the streets on mopeds. Around the midtown of Çevlik (derived from Seleucia), there is a long sandy coastline popular with daytrippers from [[Antakya]], although the sea can be stormy. This is an important nesting area of the [[endangered sea turtles|endangered sea turtle]] ''[[Caretta caretta]]''.

===Climate===
Samandağ has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa'').<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Table 1 Overview of the Köppen-Geiger climate classes including the defining criteria. |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02549-6/tables/1 |journal=Nature: Scientific Data |language=en}}</ref> Summers are hot and dry, with high humidity and very warm nights.
