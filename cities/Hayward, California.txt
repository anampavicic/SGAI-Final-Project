'''Hayward''' is a city located in [[Alameda County, California]], United States, in the [[East Bay]] subregion of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. With a population of 162,954 as of 2020,<ref name = "CensusQuickFacts" /> Hayward is the sixth largest city in the Bay Area, and the third largest in Alameda County.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hayward-ca.gov/departments/finance/documents/COH_2010_CAFR.pdf |title=COH_Budget_Back_Final.ai |access-date=December 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001055424/http://www.hayward-ca.gov/departments/finance/documents/COH_2010_CAFR.pdf |archive-date=October 1, 2011  }}</ref> Hayward was ranked as the 36th most populous [[List of municipalities in California|municipality in California]].

The city was devastated early in its history by the [[1868 Hayward earthquake]]. From the early 20th century until the beginning of the 1980s, Hayward's economy was dominated by its now defunct food canning and salt production industries.

==History==
===Early history===
Human habitation of the greater East Bay, including Hayward, dates from at least [[4th millennium BC|4000]] BC. The most recent pre-European inhabitants of the Hayward area were the Native American [[Ohlone people]].<ref>Stanger, Frank M., ed. 1968. La Peninsula Vol. XIV No. 4, March 1968.</ref>

===19th century===
[[File:Don Guillermo Castro (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Don [[Guillermo Castro (soldier)|Guillermo Castro]], a noted [[Californio]] ranchero, owned [[Rancho San Lorenzo (Castro)|Rancho San Lorenzo]], which made up the modern cities of Hayward, [[Castro Valley, California|Castro Valley]], and [[San Lorenzo, California|San Lorenzo]].]]
In the 19th century, the land that is now Hayward became part of [[Rancho San Lorenzo (Castro)|Rancho San Lorenzo]], a [[Ranchos of California|Spanish land grant]] to [[Guillermo Castro (soldier)|Guillermo Castro]], in 1841. The site of his home was on the former [[El Camino Viejo]], or Castro Street (now [[Mission Boulevard (East Bay, California)|Mission Boulevard]]) between C and D Streets, but the structure was severely damaged in the [[1868 Hayward earthquake]], with the [[Hayward Fault]] running directly under its location. Most of the city's structures were destroyed in the earthquake, the last major earthquake on the fault. In 1930, that site was chosen for the construction of the [[Alex Giualini Plaza|City Hall]], which served the city until 1969.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Officially Designated Historic Buildings of Hayward| publisher = Hayward Area Historical Society  | year = 2006  | url = http://www.haywardareahistory.org/historicbuildings-hayward.asp  | access-date =March 16, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080412055803/http://www.haywardareahistory.org/historicbuildings-hayward.asp |archive-date = April 12, 2008}}</ref>

Hayward was originally known as "Hayward's", then as "Haywood", later as "Haywards", and eventually as "Hayward". There is some disagreement as to how it was named. Most historians believe it was named for [[William Dutton Hayward]], who opened a hotel there in 1852.<ref>Gudde, Erwin G., "California Place Names" (4th Ed. 1998)</ref> The [[US Geological Survey|U.S. Geological Survey]] [[Geographic Names Information System]] states the city was named after [[Alvinza Hayward]], a millionaire from the [[California Gold Rush]].<ref>For example, see Kirkbride, Wayne, [http://mysierramountaintimes.com/?p=284 "Golden Dreams and the Success that Followed,"] Sierra Mountain Times, Retrieved on April 27, 2009; and [http://vn4.cs.fiu.edu/cgi-bin/arquery.cgi?more=1&category=newgnis&vid=&y1=37.647109&x1=-121.002009&arcriteria=1&History!=_null&description!=_null&History=Named&printable=1 GeoQuery: Places: USGS Geographic Name Information Server]; TerraFly GeoQuery website, Retrieved on April 27, 2009</ref><ref>[http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=gnispq:3:::NO::P3_FID:277607 GNIS Detail – Hayward].

William Hayward eventually became the road commissioner for [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]]. He used his authority to influence the construction of roads in his own favor. He was also an Alameda County supervisor. In 1876, a town was chartered by the State of California under the name of "Haywards". The name of the post office was then able to change because of the loss of the apostrophe before the "s". This change occurred in 1880.<ref name=CGN /> It remained "Haywards" until 1910 when the "s" was officially dropped.{{cn|date=August 2024}} William Hayward died in 1891.

Hayward grew steadily throughout the late 19th century, with an economy based on agriculture and tourism. Important crops were tomatoes, potatoes, peaches, cherries, and apricots. [[Hunt's|Hunt Brothers Cannery]] opened in 1895. Chicken and [[Pigeon keeping|pigeon raising]] also played important roles in the economy. A [[railroad|rail]] line between [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the [[South Pacific Coast Railroad]], was established but later destroyed in the [[1868 Hayward earthquake|1868 earthquake]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.museumoflocalhistory.org/pages/Hayward1868.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 30, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003181132/http://www.museumoflocalhistory.org/pages/Hayward1868.pdf |archive-date=October 3, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The Hayward shore of the Bay was developed into extensive salt evaporation ponds, and was one of the most productive areas in the world, with [[Leslie Salt]] being one of the largest companies.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://thecobblersboots.com/HaywardHistory.html |title=History of Hayward |access-date=October 7, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021002855/http://thecobblersboots.com/HaywardHistory.html |archive-date=October 21, 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

Prior to [[World War II]], Hayward had a high concentration of [[Japanese American]]s, who were subject to the [[Japanese-American internment]] during the war. The war brought an [[United States home front during World War II|economic and population boom]] to the area, as factories opened to manufacture war material. Many of the workers stayed after the end of the war. Two suburban [[tract housing]] pioneers, [[Oliver Rousseau]] and [[David D. Bohannon]], were prominent builders of postwar housing in the area.<ref>{{cite web |author=Site design and illustration by www.darriendesign.com |url=http://www.sfhistoryencyclopedia.com/articles/c/chanSunsetDistr.html |title=Encyclopedia of San Francisco |website=Sfhistoryencyclopedia.com |date=June 4, 1932 |access-date=November 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102181806/http://www.sfhistoryencyclopedia.com/articles/c/chanSunsetDistr.html |archive-date=November 2, 2011  }}</ref>

The [[Hayward Area Recreation and Park District]] was formed in 1944.

[[California State University, East Bay|California State University, Hayward]] opened in the Hayward Hills in 1957. [[Southland Mall (Hayward, California)|Southland Mall]] was dedicated in 1964.

The second San Mateo–Hayward Bridge opened in 1967. The [[City Center Building]] opened in 1969 and acted as the new city hall until 1989 when the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]] damaged the building and forced the city government to move out. The building was closed to the public in 1998, with the new [[Hayward City Hall]] opening the same year. [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|The "Bay Area Rapid Transit"]] system began operating in the Bay Area in 1972, with stations in [[Hayward station (BART)|downtown Hayward]] and [[South Hayward station|south Hayward]].

The [[Hunt's|Hunt Brothers Cannery]] closed in 1981.

===Former businesses===
====Hunt Brothers Cannery====
The economy of Hayward in the first half of the twentieth century was based largely on the [[Hunt's|Hunt Brothers Cannery]]. The cannery was opened in Hayward in 1895 by brothers William and Joseph Hunt, who were fruit packers originally from [[Sebastopol, California|Sebastopol]], California.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hunts.com/hunts_story.jsp |title=Hunt's corporate website |website=Hunts.com |access-date=November 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903052152/http://www.hunts.com/hunts_story.jsp |archive-date=September 3, 2011  }}</ref> The Hunts initially packed local fruit, including cherries, peaches, and apricots, then added tomatoes, which became the mainstay of their business. At its height in the 1960s and 1970s, Hunt's operated three canneries in Hayward, at A, B, and C Streets; an adjacent can-making company; a pickling factory; and a glass manufacturing plant. From the 1890s until its closure in 1981, Hunt's employed a large percentage of the local population. The air around Hayward was permeated by the smell of tomatoes for three months of each year, during the canning season. The canneries closed in 1981, as there were no longer enough produce fields or fruit orchards near the cannery to make it economically viable. Much of the production was moved to the [[Sacramento Valley]]. The location of the former canneries is marked by a historic water tower with the Hayward logo.<ref>[http://www.hayward-ca.gov/citygov/meetings/cca/rp/2004/rp110904-05.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719095355/http://www.hayward-ca.gov/citygov/meetings/cca/rp/2004/rp110904-05.pdf|date=July 19, 2010}}</ref> A housing development now occupies much of the former cannery site.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=OKTB&p_theme=oktb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F99329B642D7DAE&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM | work=Oakland Tribune, The | title=Housing OK'd for Hayward cannery site | date=December 21, 2001}}</ref>
