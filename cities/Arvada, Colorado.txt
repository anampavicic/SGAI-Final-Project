==History==
The first documented discovery of gold in the [[Rocky Mountains|Rocky Mountain region]] occurred on June 22, 1850, when [[Lewis Ralston]], a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] prospector traveling with a party headed for the [[Gold in California|California gold fields]], dipped his sluice pan into a small stream near its confluence with [[Clear Creek (Colorado)|Clear Creek]].<ref name=history>{{cite web |title=Arvada History |publisher=City of Arvada, Colorado |url=http://arvada.org/community/history.php |format=[[HTTP]] |access-date=August 20, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628033539/http://www.arvada.org/community/history.php |archive-date=June 28, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He found about ¼ [[troy ounce]] (8&nbsp;g) of gold, then worth about five dollars (about $550 [[USD]] today.)<ref>{{citation|title=Ralston's Gold|first=Lois Cunniff Lindstrom|last=Kennedy|publisher=Coloradream Publishing|year=2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://coloradocommunitymedia.com/2022/02/09/the-curious-case-of-lewis-ralston/|title=The curious case of Lewis Ralston|publisher=Arvada Press|date= February 9, 2022|access-date=February 27, 2024}}</ref> While Ralston was elated, the rest of the party was unimpressed and continued on to California the next morning. Ralston continued panning for gold, but after a few days gave up and caught up with his party. The site of Lewis Ralston's gold discovery now lies along [[Ralston Creek (Colorado)|Ralston Creek]] in the City of Arvada's [https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gold+Strike+Park,+5500+W+56th+Ave,+Arvada,+CO+80002/@39.7981216,-105.0589593,17z/ Gold Strike Park].

In 1858, Ralston brought another group of prospectors back to the site of his first discovery. Ralston and most of the miners gave up after a few days, but several miners found gold upstream along the [[South Platte River]]. The placer gold in the area soon played out, but hard rock deposits of gold were found in the mountains to the west. Some of the miners abandoned their search for gold and returned to farm the rich bottom land along Ralston Creek and Clear Creek. They found an eager market for their crops among other gold seekers. The [[Territory of Colorado]] was formed on February 28, 1861, and the farms in the valley expanded to feed the growing population of the region.

In 1870, the [[Colorado Central Railroad]] laid tracks through the area on its route from [[Golden, Colorado|Golden]] to link up with the [[Kansas Pacific Railroad]] and the [[Denver Pacific Railroad]] at [[History of Denver, Colorado#"The Rail City"|Jersey Junction]], {{convert|3|mi|km|0|sp=us}} north of [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]]. On December 1, 1870, Benjamin F. Wadsworth and Louis A. Reno [[platted]] the Ralston Point townsite along the railroad. To avoid confusion with other communities along [[Ralston Creek (Colorado)|Ralston Creek]], Ralston Point was soon renamed Arvada in honor of Hiram Arvada Haskin, brother-in-law of settler Mary Wadsworth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=9337|title=Profile for Arvada, Colorado|publisher=[[ePodunk]]|access-date=June 15, 2010}}</ref>  Her husband, Benjamin Wadsworth, became the first [[U.S. Postal Service|postmaster]] of Arvada. Colorado was granted [[U.S. state|statehood]] on August 1, 1876, and the Town of Arvada was formally [[Colorado municipalities|incorporated]] on August 14, 1904. A vibrant agricultural community, Arvada was once known as the "Celery Capital of the World."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arvada.org/about/our-community/arvada-fun-facts|title=Fun Facts About Arvada - City of Arvada|access-date=April 18, 2016|archive-date=April 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427114126/https://arvada.org/about/our-community/arvada-fun-facts|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Arvada grew rapidly during the latter half of the 20th century as a [[suburb]] of nearby Denver, the [[List of capitals in the United States|state capital]]. Arvada became a [[Colorado municipalities|Statutory City]] on October 31, 1951, and a [[Colorado municipalities|Home Rule Municipality]] on July 23, 1963. By the end of the millennium, the population of Arvada exceeded 100,000.

===Missionary shooting===

On December 9, 2007, Matthew J. Murray walked into the Youth With a Mission Center in Arvada and, after he was refused his request to stay overnight in the dormitories, opened fire and killed two people, injuring two more.

A memorial was held the following Wednesday, December 12, in which Youth With a Mission leaders forgave Murray's family for what happened.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/us/09cnd-shoot.html?hp|title=Gunman Kills 2 at Missionary Center Near Denver|date=December 9, 2007|access-date=December 9, 2007|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | first=John | last=Holusha| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150903193131/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/us/09cnd-shoot.html?hp| archive-date=September 3, 2015| url-status= live}}</ref>
