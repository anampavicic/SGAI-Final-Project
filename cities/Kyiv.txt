It is home to many [[High tech|high-tech]] industries, higher education institutions, and historical landmarks. The city has an extensive system of [[Transport in Kyiv|public transport]] and infrastructure, including the [[Kyiv Metro]].

The city's name is said to derive from the name of [[Kyi]], one of its four legendary founders. During [[History of Kyiv|its history]], Kyiv, one of the oldest cities in Eastern Europe, passed through several stages of prominence and obscurity. The city probably existed as a commercial center as early as the 5th century. A [[Slavs|Slavic]] settlement on the great trade route between [[Scandinavia]] and [[Constantinople]], Kyiv was a tributary of the [[Khazars]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/kiev|title=Kiev|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=4 July 2015|archive-date=5 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805021737/https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Kiev|url-status=live}}</ref> until its capture by the [[Varangians]] ([[Vikings]]) in the mid-9th century. Under Varangian rule, the city became a capital of [[Kievan Rus']], the first [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] state. Completely [[Siege of Kiev (1240)|destroyed]] during the [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'|Mongol invasions]] in 1240, the city lost most of its influence for the centuries to come. Coming under [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], then [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]] and then [[Russian Empire|Russia]], the city would grow from a frontier market into an important centre of Orthodox learning in the sixteenth century, and later of industry, commerce, and administration by the nineteenth.<ref name="auto"/>

The city prospered again during the Russian Empire's [[Industrial Revolution]] in the late 19th century. In 1918, when the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] declared independence from the [[Russian Republic]] after the [[October Revolution]] there, Kyiv became its capital. From the end of the [[Ukrainian-Soviet war|Ukrainian-Soviet]] and [[Polish–Soviet war|Polish-Soviet]] wars in 1921, Kyiv was a city of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]], and made its capital in 1934. The city suffered significant destruction during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]] but quickly recovered in the postwar years, remaining the [[Soviet Union]]'s third-largest city.

Following [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the collapse of the Soviet Union]] and [[Independence of Ukraine|Ukrainian independence]] in 1991, Kyiv remained Ukraine's capital and experienced a steady [[Immigration to Ukraine|influx]] of [[Ukrainians|ethnic Ukrainian]] migrants from other [[Regions of Ukraine|regions of the country]].<ref name="History of Ukraine">{{cite book|last=Magocsi|first=Paul Robert|title=A History of Ukraine: The Land and Its Peoples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0mKRsElYNkC&pg=PT481|edition=2nd, Revised|year=2010|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-4426-9879-6|page=481|access-date=9 September 2017|archive-date=14 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200614025229/https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0mKRsElYNkC&pg=PT481|url-status=live}}</ref> During the country's transformation to a [[market economy]] and [[Representative democracy|electoral democracy]], Kyiv has continued to be Ukraine's largest and wealthiest city. Its armament-dependent industrial output fell after the Soviet collapse, adversely affecting science and technology, but new sectors of the economy such as services and [[finance]] facilitated Kyiv's growth in salaries and investment, as well as providing continuous funding for the development of [[housing]] and urban infrastructure. Kyiv emerged as the most [[pro-Western]] region of Ukraine; [[political parties in Ukraine|parties]] advocating tighter [[Ukraine–European Union relations|integration with the European Union]] dominate during [[Elections in Ukraine|elections]].

The traditional etymology, stemming from the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'', is that the name is a derivation of [[Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv|Kyi]] ({{langx|uk|Кий|links=no}}, {{langx|ru|Кий|links=no}},{{efn|[[Reforms of Russian orthography|pre-1918 spelling]]: Кій}} {{small|[[Romanization of Russian|rom.]]:}} ''Ky''<!--WP:RUS--> or ''Kiy''), the legendary eponymous founder of the city. According to [[Oleg Trubachyov]]'s etymological dictionary from the [[Old East Slavic language|Old East Slavic]] name ''*Kyjevŭ gordŭ'' (literally, "Kyi's castle", "Kyi's [[Gord (archaeology)|gord]]"), from [[Proto-Slavic]] ''*kyjevъ'',<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title=*kyjevъ/*kyjevo|date=1987|dictionary=Ėtimologicheskiĭ slovarʹ slavi͡anskikh I͡Azykov: Praslavi͡anskiĭ leksicheskiĭ fond|language=ru|editor-last=Trubachev|editor-first=O. N.|editor-link=Oleg Trubachyov|volume=13 (*kroměžirъ–*kyžiti)|publisher=Nauka|location=Moscow|pages=256–257}}</ref> This etymology has been questioned, for instance by [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]] who called it an "etymological myth", and meant that the names of the legendary founders are in turn based on place names. According to the Canadian Ukrainian linguist [[Jaroslav Rudnyckyj]], the name can be connected to the Proto-Slavic root [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/kyjь|*kyjь]], but should be interpreted as meaning 'stick, pole' as in its modern Ukrainian equivalent [[wikt:кий#Ukrainian|Кий]]. The name should in that case be interpreted as 'palisaded settlement'.<ref>Rudnyc'kyj, Jaroslav Bohdan (1962–1982). An etymological dictionary of the Ukrainian language. 2., rev. ed.

===Founding===
Scholars continue to debate when the city was founded: The traditional founding date is 482 CE, so the city celebrated [[1500th anniversary of Kyiv|its 1,500th anniversary]] in 1982.

There are several legendary accounts of the origin of the city. One tells of members of a Slavic tribe ([[Polans (eastern)|Eastern Polans]]), brothers Kyi (the eldest, after whom the city was named), Shchek, Khoryv, and their sister Lybid, who founded the city (See the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'').<ref name=use/> Another legend states that [[Saint Andrew]] passed through the area in the 1st century. Where the city is now he erected a cross, where a church later was built. Since the [[Middle Ages]] an image of [[Michael (archangel)|Saint Michael]] has represented the city as well as the [[Duchy of Kiev|duchy]].

There is little historical evidence pertaining to the period when the city was founded. Scattered [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] settlements existed in the area from the 6th century, but it is unclear whether any of them later developed into the city. On the [[Ptolemy's world map|Ptolemy world map]] there are several settlements indicated along the mid-stream of [[Borysthenes]], among which is Azagarium, which some historians believe to be the predecessor to Kyiv.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YWg2ywEACAAJ|title=Римский Киев: или Castrum Azagarium на Киево-Подоле|first=Борис|last=Ерофалов-Пилипчак|date=22 February 2019|publisher=A+C|isbn=9786177765010|via=Google Books|access-date=17 June 2020|archive-date=21 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200621175340/https://books.google.com/books/about/%D0%A0%D0%B8%D0%BC%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%9A%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2.html?id=YWg2ywEACAAJ|url-status=live}}</ref>

However, according to the 1773 ''Dictionary of Ancient Geography'' of [[Alexander Macbean]], that settlement corresponds to the modern city of [[Chernobyl]]. Just south of Azagarium, there is another settlement, Amadoca, believed to be the capital of the Amadoci people<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eMUBAAAAYAAJ&dq=Amadoca&pg=PA29|title=The Classical Gazetteer: A Dictionary of Ancient Geography, Sacred and Profane|first=William|last=Hazlitt|date=22 February 1851|publisher=Whittaker|via=Google Books|access-date=17 June 2020|archive-date=4 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804081050/https://books.google.com/books?id=eMUBAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=Amadoca&source=bl&ots=IlQ3FheTTw&sig=ACfU3U0CbJwExMEZ01bbTNgNHIofesupoQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiz0fCGkYjqAhU5RDABHRzPB90Q6AEwEHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=Amadoca&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref> living in an area between the marshes of Amadoca in the west and the Amadoca mountains in the east.

Another name for Kyiv mentioned in history, the origin of which is not completely clear, is Sambat, which apparently has something to do with the [[Khazar Empire]]. The ''Primary Chronicle'' says the residents of Kyiv told [[Askold and Dir|Askold]] "there were three brothers Kyi, Shchek, and Khoriv. They founded this town and died, and now we are staying and paying taxes to their relatives the Khazars". In ''De Administrando Imperio'', [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]] mentions a caravan of small cargo boats which assembled annually, and writes, "They come down the river Dnieper and assemble at the strong-point of Kyiv (Kioava), also called Sambatas".<ref>Sigfús Blöndal. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=vFRug14ui7gC&dq=de+administrando+imperio+Kioava&pg=PA9 The Varangians of Byzantium] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200625114047/https://books.google.com/books?id=vFRug14ui7gC&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=de+administrando+imperio+Kioava&source=bl&ots=Wnsq6ePXjd&sig=ACfU3U0q7AqEvpTy7StBDeqXxKsRj5Ee3A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj0ooe3rYjqAhVwQjABHfbIBRsQ6AEwAXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=de%20administrando%20imperio%20Kioava&f=false |date=25 June 2020 }}".</ref>

At least three Arabic-speaking 10th century geographers who traveled the area mention the city of Zānbat as the chief city of the Russes. Among them are ibn Rustah, [[Abu Sa'id Gardezi]], and an author of the [[Hudud al-'Alam]]. The texts of those authors were discovered by Russian orientalist [[Alexander Tumansky]]. The etymology of Sambat has been argued by many historians, including [[:ru:Ильинский, Григорий Андреевич|Grigoriy Ilyinsky]], [[Nikolay Karamzin]], [[Jan Potocki]], [[:ru:Ламбин, Николай Петрович|Nikolay Lambin]], [[Joachim Lelewel]], and [[Guðbrandur Vigfússon]].

The Primary Chronicle states that at some point during the late 9th or early 10th century Askold and Dir, who may have been of Viking or Varangian descent, ruled in Kyiv. They were murdered by [[Oleg of Novgorod]] in 882, but some historians, such as [[Omeljan Pritsak]] and [[Constantine Zuckerman]], dispute that, arguing that Khazar rule continued as late as the 920s, leaving historical documents such as the [[Kievan Letter]] and [[Schechter Letter]].

Other historians suggest that [[Magyar tribes]] ruled the city between 840 and 878, before migrating with some [[Khazars|Khazar]] tribes to the [[Carpathian Basin]]. The Primary Chronicle mentions Hungarians passing near Kyiv. [[Askold's Grave]] was previously known as "[[:ru:Угорское урочище|Uhorske urochyshche]]" (Hungarian place).<ref>[https://pechersk.kyivcity.gov.ua/content/mennyu-1.html History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200613215705/https://pechersk.kyivcity.gov.ua/content/mennyu-1.html |date=13 June 2020 }}. Pechersk Raion in the Kiev City.</ref>

According to the aforementioned scholars the building of the fortress of Kyiv was finished in 840 under the leadership of Keő (Keve), Csák, and Geréb, three brothers, possibly members of the [[Tarján tribe]]. The three names appear in the Kyiv Chronicle as Kyi, Shchek, and Khoryv and may be not of Slavic origin, as Russian historians have always struggled to account for their meanings and origins. According to Hungarian historian Viktor Padányi, their names were inserted into the Kyiv Chronicle in the 12th century, and they were identified as old-Russian mythological heroes.<ref>dr.

In the early 1320s, a Lithuanian army led by Grand Duke [[Gediminas]] defeated a Slavic army led by [[Stanislav of Kyiv]] at the [[Battle on the Irpen' River]] and conquered the city. The [[Tatars]], who also claimed Kyiv, retaliated in 1324–1325, so while Kyiv was ruled by a Lithuanian prince, it had to pay tribute to the [[Golden Horde]]. Finally, as a result of the [[Battle of Blue Waters]] in 1362, [[Algirdas]], Grand Duke of Lithuania, incorporated Kyiv and surrounding areas into the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].<ref>Jones, Michael (2000).

===Russian suzerainty===
Occupied by Russian troops since the 1654 [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]], Kyiv became a part of the [[Tsardom of Russia]] from 1667 on the [[Truce of Andrusovo]] and enjoyed a degree of autonomy. None of the Polish-Russian treaties concerning Kyiv have ever been ratified.<ref>[[Eugeniusz Romer]], O wschodniej granicy Polski z przed 1772 r., w: Księga Pamiątkowa ku czci Oswalda Balzera, t. II, Lwów 1925, s. [358].</ref> In the [[Russian Empire]], Kyiv was a primary [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Christian centre]], attracting [[pilgrim]]s, and the cradle of many of the empire's most important religious figures, but until the 19th century, the city's commercial importance remained marginal.

In 1834, the Russian government established Saint Vladimir University, now called the [[Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv]] after the Ukrainian poet [[Taras Shevchenko]] (1814–1861). (Shevchenko worked as a field researcher and editor for the geography department). The medical faculty of Saint Vladimir University, separated into an independent institution in 1919–1921 during the Soviet period, became the [[Bogomolets National Medical University]] in 1995.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, the [[Imperial Russian Army]] and ecclesiastical authorities dominated city life;{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] had involvement in a significant part of Kyiv's infrastructure and commercial activity. In the late 1840s the historian, [[Mykola Kostomarov]] (Russian: {{transliteration|ru|Nikolai Kostomarov}}), founded a secret political society, the Brotherhood of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saint Cyril]] and Methodius, whose members put forward the idea of a federation of free [[Slavic peoples]] with Ukrainians as a distinct and separate group rather than a subordinate part of the Russian nation; the Russian authorities quickly suppressed the society.

Following the gradual loss of Ukraine's autonomy, Kyiv experienced growing [[Russification]] in the 19th century, by means of Russian migration, administrative actions, and social modernization. At the beginning of the 20th century the [[Russian language in Ukraine|Russian-speaking]] part of the population dominated the city centre, while the [[Social class|lower classes]] living on the outskirts retained Ukrainian [[folk culture]] to a significant extent.{{Citation needed|date= April 2011}} However, enthusiasts among ethnic Ukrainian aristocrats, soldiers, and merchants made attempts to preserve the native culture in Kyiv, by clandestine book-printing, amateur theatre, folk studies, etc.

[[File:Kiev downtown.jpg|thumb|right|Kyiv in the late 19th century]]
During the [[Industrialization in the Russian Empire|Russian industrial revolution]] in the late 19th century, Kyiv became an important trade and transportation centre of the Russian Empire, specialising in sugar and grain export by railway and on the [[Dnieper river]]. By 1900, the city had also become a significant industrial centre, with a population of 250,000. Landmarks of that period include the railway infrastructure, the foundation of numerous educational and cultural facilities, and notable architectural monuments (mostly merchant-oriented). In 1892, the [[Trams in Kyiv|first electric tram line]] of the Russian Empire started running in Kyiv (the third in the world). Kyiv prospered during the late 19th century [[Industrial Revolution]] in the Russian Empire, when it became the third most important city of the Empire and the major centre of commerce in its southwest.

===Soviet era===
In the [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution|turbulent period]] following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|1917 Russian Revolution]], Kyiv became the capital of several [[Ukrainian People's Republic|successive Ukrainian states]] and was caught in the middle of several conflicts: [[World War I]], during which German soldiers occupied it from 2 March 1918 to November 1918, the [[Russian Civil War]] of 1917 to 1922, and the [[Polish–Soviet War]] of 1919–1921. During the last three months of 1919, Kyiv was intermittently controlled by the [[White Army]]. Kyiv changed hands sixteen times from the end of 1918 to August 1920.<ref>{{cite book |title= Walking Since Daybreak|url= https://archive.org/details/walkingsincedayb0000ekst|url-access= registration|last= Eksteins|first= Modris|year= 1999|publisher= [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]]|isbn= 0-618-08231-X|page= [https://archive.org/details/walkingsincedayb0000ekst/page/87 87]}}</ref>

From 1921 to 1991, the city formed part of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], which became a founding republic of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1922. The major events that took place in Soviet Ukraine during the [[interwar period]] all affected Kyiv: the 1920s [[Ukrainization]] as well as the migration of the rural Ukrainophone population made the [[Russophone]] city Ukrainian-speaking and bolstered the development of [[Ukrainian culture|Ukrainian cultural life]] in the city; the [[Industrialization in the Soviet Union|Soviet industrialization]] that started in the late 1920s turned the city, a former centre of commerce and religion, into a major industrial, technological and scientific centre; the [[Holodomor|1932–1933 Great Famine]] devastated the part of the migrant population not registered for ration cards; and [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]] of 1937–1938 almost eliminated the city's [[intelligentsia]]<ref name="Brama">{{cite web |url= http://www.brama.com/ukraine/history/terror/index.html |title= The Great Purge under Stalin 1937–38 |publisher= brama.com |access-date= 14 January 2010 |archive-date= 24 January 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100124123256/http://www.brama.com/ukraine/history/terror/index.html |url-status= live }}</ref><ref name="Figes">[[Orlando Figes]] ''The Whisperers: Private Life in Stalin's Russia'', 2007, {{ISBN|0805074619}}, pages 227–315.</ref><ref name="Social Catastrophe">Robert Gellately, ''Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler: The Age of Social Catastrophe'' (Knopf, 2007: {{ISBN|1-4000-4005-1}}), 720 pages.</ref>

In 1934, Kyiv became the capital of Soviet Ukraine. The city boomed again during the years of Soviet industrialization as its population grew rapidly and many industrial giants were established, some of which exist today.

[[File:Ruined Kiev in WWII.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of Kyiv during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War&nbsp;II]]]]
In [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]], the city again suffered significant damage, and [[Nazi Germany]] occupied it from 19 September 1941 to [[Battle of Kiev (1943)|6 November 1943]].

Kyiv recovered economically in the post-war years, becoming once again the third-most important city of the Soviet Union. The [[Chernobyl disaster|catastrophic accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] in 1986 occurred only {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the city. However, the prevailing south wind blew most of the radioactive debris away from Kyiv.

===Independence===
In the course of the [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]] the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian parliament]] proclaimed the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine]] in the city on 24 August 1991. In 2004–2005, the city played host to the largest post-Soviet public demonstrations up to that time, in support of the [[Orange Revolution]]. From November 2013 until February 2014, central Kyiv became the primary location of [[Euromaidan]]. During the onset of the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russian invasion of Ukraine]] in February 2022, [[Russian Armed Forces|Russian forces]] attempted to [[Kyiv offensive (2022)|seize Kyiv]] but were [[Battle of Kyiv (2022)|repelled]] by [[Armed Forces of Ukraine|Ukrainian forces]] on the outskirts of the city; Kyiv itself escaped major damage. Following the Russian retreat from the region in April 2022, Kyiv has been subject to frequent [[Kyiv strikes (2022–present)|air strikes]].

===Geography===
[[File:Kyiv, Ukraine ESA22370890 (cropped).jpeg|thumb|A [[Copernicus Programme]] [[Sentinel-2]] image of Kyiv and the [[Dnieper]]]]
Geographically, Kyiv is on the border of the [[Polesia]] woodland ecological zone, a part of the European mixed woods area, and the East European [[forest steppe]] [[biome]]. However, the city's unique landscape distinguishes it from the surrounding region. Kyiv is completely surrounded by [[Kyiv Oblast]].

Originally on the west bank, today Kyiv is on both sides of the [[Dnieper]], which flows southwards through the city towards the [[Black Sea]]. The older and higher western part of the city sits on numerous wooded hills ([[Kyiv Mountains|Kyiv Hills]]), with ravines and small rivers. Kyiv's geographical relief contributed to its [[toponym]]s, such as ''Podil'' ("lower"), ''Pechersk'' ("caves"), and ''uzviz'' (a steep street, "descent"). Kyiv is a part of the larger [[Dnieper Upland]] adjoining the western bank of the Dnieper in its mid-flow, and which contributes to the city's elevation change.

The northern outskirts of the city border the [[Polesian Lowland]]. Kyiv expanded into the [[Dnieper Lowland]] on the left bank (''to the east'') as late as the 20th century. The whole portion of Kyiv on the left bank of the Dnieper is generally referred to as the ''Left Bank'' ({{lang|uk|Лівий берег}}, ''Livyi bereh''). Significant areas of the left bank Dnieper valley were artificially sand-deposited, and are protected by dams.

Within the city the Dnieper River forms a branching system of [[tributary|tributaries]], isles, and harbors within the city limits. The city is close to the mouth of the [[Desna River]] and the [[Kyiv Reservoir]] in the north, and the [[Kaniv Reservoir]] in the south. Both the Dnieper and Desna rivers are [[navigation|navigable]] at Kyiv, although regulated by the reservoir shipping locks and limited by winter freeze-over.

In total, there are 448 bodies of open water within the boundaries of Kyiv, which include the Dnieper itself, its reservoirs, and several small rivers, dozens of lakes and artificially created ponds. They occupy 7949 hectares. Additionally, the city has 16 developed beaches (totalling 140 hectares) and 35 near-water recreational areas (covering more than 1,000 hectares). Many are used for pleasure and recreation, although some of the bodies of water are not suitable for swimming.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kyivcity.gov.ua/news/u_kiyevi_bilya_vodoym_vidkrito_32_zoni_dlya_vidpochinku_z_yakikh_12__iz_mozhlivistyu_kupannya/ |website=kyivcity.gov.ua |title=У Києві біля водойм відкрито 32 зони для відпочинку, з яких 12 – із можливістю купання |language=uk |date=19 June 2020 |access-date=12 October 2020 |archive-date=9 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200809002809/https://kyivcity.gov.ua/news/u_kiyevi_bilya_vodoym_vidkrito_32_zoni_dlya_vidpochinku_z_yakikh_12__iz_mozhlivistyu_kupannya/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2020/06/19/7256376/ |website=pravda.com.ua |title=У Кличка розповіли, де в Києві можна купатися, а де тільки засмагати.

=== Legal status and local government ===
{{Main|Legal status and local government of Kyiv}}

The municipality of the city of Kyiv has a [[Cities with special status|special legal status]] within Ukraine compared to the other [[Administrative divisions of Ukraine|administrative subdivisions of the country]]. The most significant difference is that the city is considered as a region of Ukraine (see [[Regions of Ukraine]]). It is the only city that has double jurisdiction. The Head of [[Chief of Local State Administration (Ukraine)|City State Administration]] – the city's governor – is appointed by the [[president of Ukraine]], while the Head of the City Council – the [[mayor of Kyiv]] – is elected by local popular vote.

The mayor of Kyiv is [[Vitali Klitschko]], who was sworn in on 5 June 2014,<ref name=KKMs5614>[https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/208052.html Vitali Klitschko sworn in as mayor of Kyiv] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201111202603/https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/208052.html |date=11 November 2020 }}, [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (5 June 2014)</ref> after he had won the [[2014 Kyiv local election|25 May 2014 Kyiv mayoral elections]] with almost 57% of the votes.<ref name="votecountKMEIU4614">[https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/207829.html Klitschko officially announced as winner of Kyiv mayor election] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200907181110/https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/207829.html |date=7 September 2020 }}, [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (4 June 2014)</ref> Since 25 June 2014, Klitschko is also [[Kyiv City State Administration|Head of Kyiv City Administration]].<ref name="Poroshenko appoints Klitschko head of Kyiv city administration - decree">[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/210904.html Poroshenko appoints Klitschko head of Kyiv city administration – decree] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704081010/http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/210904.html |date=4 July 2014 }}, [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (25 June 2014)<br />[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/210980.html Poroshenko orders Klitschko to bring title of best European capital back to Kyiv] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714210807/http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/210980.html |date=14 July 2014 }}, [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (25 June 2014)</ref> Klitschko was last reelected in the [[2020 Kyiv local election]] with 50.52% of the votes, in the first round of the election.<ref name="3131537KlitschkoRE">[https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-elections/3131537-vitali-klitschko-wins-in-first-round-of-kyiv-mayor-election.html Vitali Klitschko wins in first round of Kyiv mayor election] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201106152400/https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-elections/3131537-vitali-klitschko-wins-in-first-round-of-kyiv-mayor-election.html |date=6 November 2020 }}, [[Ukrinform]] (6 November 2020)</ref>

Most key buildings of the national government are along [[Hrushevsky Street (Kyiv)|Hrushevskoho Street]] (''vulytsia Mykhaila Hrushevskoho'') and Institute Street (''vulytsia Instytutska''). Hrushevskoho Street is named after the Ukrainian academician, politician, historian, and statesman [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], who wrote an academic book titled: "Bar Starostvo: Historical Notes: XV–XVIII" about the history of [[Bar, Ukraine]].<ref>Hrushevsky, M., Bar Starostvo: Historical Notes: XV–XVIII, St. Vladimir University Publishing House, Bol'shaya-Vasil'kovskaya, Building no. 29–31, Kiev, Ukraine, 1894; Lviv, Ukraine, {{ISBN|5-12-004335-6}}, pp. 1–623, 1996.</ref> That portion of the city is also unofficially known as the government quarter ({{lang|uk|урядовий квартал}}).

The city state administration and council is in the Kyiv City council building on Khreshchatyk Street. The oblast state administration and council is in the oblast council building on ''ploshcha Lesi Ukrainky'' ("Lesya Ukrainka Square").

The [[Dnieper River]] naturally divides Kyiv into the Right Bank and the Left Bank areas. Historically on the western right bank of the river, the city expanded into the left bank only in the 20th century. Most of Kyiv's attractions as well as the majority of business and governmental institutions are on the right bank. The eastern "Left Bank" is predominantly residential. There are large industrial and green areas in both the Right Bank and the Left Bank.

Kyiv is further informally divided into historical or territorial neighbourhoods, each housing from about 5,000 to 100,000 inhabitants.

The first known formal subdivision of Kyiv dates to 1810 when the city was subdivided into 4 parts: [[Pechersk, Kyiv|Pechersk]], Starokyiv, and the first and the second parts of [[Podil]]. In 1833–1834 according to [[Russian tsar|Tsar]] [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]'s decree, Kyiv was subdivided into 6 police [[raion]]s ([[Urban districts of Ukraine|districts]]); later being increased to 10. In 1917, there were 8 Raion Councils (''Duma''), which were reorganised by [[bolshevik]]s into 6 Party-Territory Raions.

During the Soviet era, as the city was expanding, the number of raions also gradually increased. These newer districts of the city, along with some older areas were then named in honour of prominent communists and socialist-revolutionary figures; however, due to the way in which many communist party members eventually, after a certain period of time, fell out of favour and so were replaced with new, fresher minds, so too did the names of Kyiv's districts change accordingly.

The last district reform took place in 2001 when the number of districts was decreased from 14 to 10.

Under [[Oleksandr Omelchenko]] (mayor from 1999 to 2006), there were further plans for the merger of some districts and revision of their boundaries, and the total number of districts had been planned to be decreased from 10 to 7. With the election of the new mayor-elect ([[Leonid Chernovetskyi]]) in 2006, these plans were shelved.

Each district has its own [[local government|locally elected council]] with jurisdiction over a limited scope of affairs.<ref name="796003Kyivdistrictcouncils">{{in lang|uk}} [https://interfax.com.ua/news/general/796003.html Elections to Kyiv district councils will take place on October 30 &#91;2022&#93; – the decision of the Kyiv City Council] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220203180827/https://interfax.com.ua/news/general/796003.html |date=3 February 2022 }}, [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (3 February 2022)</ref>

According to the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|All-Ukrainian Census]], the population of Kyiv in 2001 was 2,611,327.<ref name="population">The most recent [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|Ukrainian census]], conducted on 5 December 2001, gave the population of Kyiv as 2 611 300 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100820175437/http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/regions/reg_mkyiv/ Ukrcensus.gov.ua – Kyiv city] Web address accessed on 4 August 2007). Estimates based on the amount of bakery products sold in the city (thus including temporary visitors and commuters) suggest a minimum of 3.5&nbsp;million.

Some 1,069,700 people had higher or completed secondary education, a significant increase of 21.7% since 1989.

===Ethnic composition===
Kyiv's ethnic composition has shifted greatly over the last centuries. According to the {{Interlanguage link|1874 Kiev city census|lt=census of March 2, 1874|uk|Київський одноденний перепис (1874)}}, conducted by the local branch of the [[Russian Geographical Society]], there were 127,205 people living in Kyiv. Of these, 80% spoke "[[Russian language|Russian]]," 11% spoke "[[Yiddish|Jewish]]," 6% spoke [[Polish language|Polish]] and 2% spoke [[German language|German]]. Of the "Russian" speakers, 39% were recorded as speaking Little Russian (Ukrainian), which meant that Ukrainian speakers accounted for 30% of the city as a whole. Of the remaining "Russian" speakers, however, there were only 10% who spoke Greater Russian ([[Russian language|Russian]]) and 2% who spoke [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]. The remaining 49% spoke in "generally Russian speech."{{Sfn|Hamm|1993|p=103}} According to the official census of 1897, the number of Great Russian speakers rose to 54%; speakers of Little Russian accounted for 22%. Jewish speakers accounted for 12%, Polish 6.7%.{{Sfn|Hamm|1993|p=103-104}}

By the September 1917 city-census of Kyiv, conducted by the authorities of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], the Ukrainian share of the population had been reduced to only 16%, while Russians now made up a majority at 50%. The [[Kyiv city census (1919)|March 1919 Kyiv city census]], conducted by the Bolshevik authorities, showed an increase in the percentage of the population identifying as Ukrainian to 25%. From then on, the city's Ukrainian population once again began to expand in terms of their share of the population, slowly returning to its former level.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Makaryk |first1=Irene Rima |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PWknXDfsY6cC&pg=PA74 |title=Modernism in Kyiv: Kiev/Kyïv/Kiev/Kijów: Jubilant Experimentation |last2=Tkacz |first2=Virlana |date=2010-01-01 |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |isbn=978-1-4426-4098-6 |page=74 |language=en |via=[[Google Books]] |access-date=29 March 2023 |archive-date=25 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230425002007/https://books.google.com/books?id=PWknXDfsY6cC&pg=PA74 |url-status=live }}</ref> By the [[Soviet Census (1926)|1926 Soviet census]], Ukrainians, at 41.6%, had once again begun to outnumber Russians, who made up 25.5%.

According to the 2001 census data, more than 130 nationalities and ethnic groups reside within the territory of Kyiv.

A 2015 study by the [[International Republican Institute]] found that 94% of Kyiv was ethnic Ukrainian, and 5% ethnic Russian.<ref name="iri1">{{cite journal|title=Ukrainian Municipal Survey, March 2–20 2015|journal=IRI|url=http://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/2015-05-19_ukraine_national_municipal_survey_march_2-20_2015.pdf|access-date=27 May 2015|archive-date=19 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019081334/http://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/2015-05-19_ukraine_national_municipal_survey_march_2-20_2015.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> Most of the city's non-Slav population comprises Tatars, [[Peoples of the Caucasus|South Caucasians]], and other peoples from the [[former Soviet Union]].

The plans of building massive monuments (of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and Stalin) were also abandoned, due to lack of money (in the 1930s–1950s) and because of Kyiv's hilly landscape.<ref name="Forgotten Soviet Plans For Kyiv"/> Experiencing rapid population growth between the 1970s and the mid-1990s, the city has continued its consistent growth after the turn of the millennium. As a result, Kyiv's central districts provide a dotted contrast of new, modern buildings among the pale yellows, blues, and greys of older apartments. [[Urban sprawl]] has gradually reduced, while population densities of suburbs has increased. The most expensive properties are in the Pechersk and Khreshchatyk areas. It is also prestigious to own a property in newly constructed buildings in the [[Kharkivskyi Masyv|Kharkivskyi neighborhood]] or [[Obolon Raion|Obolon]] along the Dnieper.

Kyiv's most famous historical architecture complexes are the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral, Kyiv|St. Sophia Cathedral]] and the [[Kyiv Pechersk Lavra]] (Monastery of the Caves), which are recognized by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]]. Noteworthy historical architectural landmarks also include the [[Mariinskyi Palace]] (designed and constructed from 1745 to 1752, then reconstructed in 1870), several [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] churches such as [[St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery|St. Michael's Cathedral]], [[St Andrew's Church, Kyiv|St. Andrew's]], [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral|St. Volodymyr's]], [[St. Cyril's Monastery, Kyiv|St. Cyril's]], the reconstructed [[Golden Gate, Kyiv|Golden Gate]] and others.

One of Kyiv's widely recognized modern landmarks is the highly visible giant [[Mother Ukraine]] statue made of titanium standing at the [[National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War]] on the Right bank of the Dnieper. Other notable sites is the cylindrical Salut hotel, across from Glory Square and the [[eternal flame]] at the World War Two memorial [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Kyiv)|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]], and the [[House with Chimaeras]].

Among Kyiv's best-known monuments are [[Mikhail Mikeshin]]'s statue of [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] astride his horse near [[Saint Sophia's Cathedral, Kiev|St. Sophia Cathedral]], the venerated [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Vladimir the Great]] (St. Vladimir), the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|baptizer of Rus']], overlooking the river above Podil from [[Saint Volodymyr Hill]], the monument to Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv and Lybid, the legendary founders of the city at the Dnieper embankment. On Independence Square in the city centre, two monuments elevate two of the city protectors; the historic protector of Kyiv Michael Archangel atop a reconstruction of one of the old city's gates and a modern invention, the goddess-protector [[Berehynia]] atop a tall column.

Kyiv was the historic cultural centre of the [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] civilization and a major cradle for the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus]]. Kyiv retained through centuries its cultural importance and even at times of relative decay, it remained the centre of primary importance of Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Its sacred sites of Kyiv Pechersk Lavra (the Monastery of the Caves) and the Saint Sophia Cathedral are attracting pilgrims for centuries and recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, remaining the primary religious centres as well as major tourist attractions. The above-mentioned sites are also part of the [[Seven Wonders of Ukraine]] collection.

In September 2023, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee placed the Saint Sophia Cathedral and Kyiv Pechersk Lavra on the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]]. According to the committee, although the Ukrainian government has taken action to protect the sites, "optimal conditions are no longer met to fully guarantee the protection of the Outstanding Universal Value of the property and that it is threatened by potential danger due to the war”. The list is protected by the [[World Heritage Convention|1972 UNESCO Convention]], ratified by both Russia and Ukraine. Inclusion on the list is intended to mobilize urgent international support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2023/09/15/unesco-adds-kyiv-lviv-sites-world-heritage-danger|title=Unesco adds sites in Kyiv and Lviv to list of world heritage in danger|first1=Elena|last1=Goukassian|date=15 September 2023|website=The Art Newspaper|access-date=14 October 2023|archive-date=19 October 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231019054501/https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2023/09/15/unesco-adds-kyiv-lviv-sites-world-heritage-danger|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-un-heritage-war-54620f9e495fe50349cc568c8347ab87|title=UNESCO puts 2 locations in war-ravaged Ukraine on its list of historic sites in danger|first1=Baraa|last1=Anwer|date=September 15, 2023|work=Associated Press News|access-date=14 October 2023|archive-date=19 October 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231019054501/https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-un-heritage-war-54620f9e495fe50349cc568c8347ab87|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/158/|title=World Heritage in Danger|website=UNESCO World Heritage Convention|access-date=14 October 2023|archive-date=5 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200705132146/https://whc.unesco.org/en/158/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Here one will find table after table of individuals hawking everything imaginable: vegetables, fresh and smoked meats, fish, cheese, honey, dairy products such as milk and home-made ''smetana'' (sour cream), [[caviar]], cut flowers, housewares, tools and hardware, and clothing. Each of the markets has its own unique mix of products with some markets devoted solely to specific wares such as automobiles, car parts, pets, clothing, flowers, and other things.

At the city's southern outskirts, near the historic [[Pyrohiv]] village, there is an [[Open-air museum|outdoor museum]] officially called the Museum of Folk Architecture and Life of Ukraine. It has an area of {{convert|1.5|km2|sqmi|0}}. This territory houses several "mini-villages" that represent by region the traditional rural architecture of Ukraine.

During the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] held in the Soviet Union, Kyiv held the preliminary matches and the quarter-finals of the football tournament at its [[Olimpiyskiy National Sports Complex|Olympic Stadium]], which was reconstructed specially for the event. From 1 December 2008, the stadium underwent a full-scale reconstruction in order to satisfy standards put in place by [[UEFA]] for hosting the [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] football tournament; the opening ceremony took place in the presence of president [[Viktor Yanukovych]] on 8 October 2011,<ref name=YanuBOO>{{cite news |title=Kyiv opens host stadium for Euro 2012 final |url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/city/detail/114397/ |work=[[Kyiv Post]] |date=9 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022164516/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/city/detail/114397/ |archive-date=22 October 2011 }}</ref> with the first major event being a [[Shakira]] concert which was specially planned to coincide with the stadium's re-opening during Euro 2012.

Most Ukrainian national teams play their home international matches in Kyiv. The [[Ukraine national football team]], for example, will play matches at the re-constructed Olympic Stadium from 2011.

The Metro carries around 1.422 million passengers daily<ref name="update">{{Cite web|url=http://kyiv.ukrstat.gov.ua/p.php3?c=2257|title=Головне управління статистики м.Києва – Пасажирські перевезення АРХІВ 2011 року|website=kyiv.ukrstat.gov.ua|access-date=11 October 2020|archive-date=1 December 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201201091103/http://kyiv.ukrstat.gov.ua/p.php3?c=2257|url-status=live}}</ref> accounting for 38% of the Kyiv's public transport load. In 2011, the total number of trips exceeded 519 million.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

The historic tram system was the first electric tramway in the former Russian Empire and the third one in Europe after the [[Trams in Berlin|Berlin Straßembahn]] and the [[Budapest]] tramway. The tram system consists of {{convert|139.9|km|mi|abbr=on}} of track,<ref>For a 2004 plan of the Kyiv tram, please see [http://www.mashke.org/kievtram/history/schemes/2004/2004-tram.jpg mashke.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194057/http://www.mashke.org/kievtram/history/schemes/2004/2004-tram.jpg |date=3 March 2016 }}</ref> including {{convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on}} two [[Kyiv Light Rail|Rapid Tram]] lines, served by 21 routes with the use of 523 tram cars. Once a well maintained and widely used method of transport, the system is now gradually being phased out in favor of buses and trolleybuses.

The Kyiv Funicular was constructed during 1902–1905. It connects the historic [[Old Kyiv|Uppertown]], and the lower commercial neighborhood of [[Podil]] through the steep Saint Volodymyr Hill overseeing the Dnieper River. The line consists of two stations.

All public road transport (except for some minibuses) is operated by the united [[Kyivpastrans]] municipal company. It is heavily subsidized by the city.

The Kyiv public transport system, except for taxi, uses a simple [[flat rate]] tariff system regardless of distance traveled: tickets or tokens must be purchased each time a vehicle is boarded. [[Digital ticket]] system is already established in Kyiv Metro, with plans for other transport modes. The cost of one ride is far lower than in Western Europe.

The taxi market in Kyiv is expansive but not regulated. In particular, the taxi fare per kilometer is not regulated. There is a fierce competition between private taxi companies.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

====Roads and bridges====
Kyiv represents the focal point of Ukraine's "national roads" system, thus linked by road to all cities of the country. [[international E-road network|European route]]s [[File:Tabliczka E40.svg|35px|link=European route E40]], [[File:Tabliczka E95.svg|35px|link=European route E95]] and [[File:Tabliczka E373.svg|35px|link=European route E373]] intersect in Kyiv.

There are eight Dnieper bridges and dozens of [[grade separation|grade-separated]] intersections in the city. Several new intersections are under construction. There are plans to build a full-size, fully grade-separated [[ring road]] around Kyiv.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fakty.ua/140163-masshtabnoe-stroitelstvo |title=Азаров дал добро на строительство кольцевой дороги вокруг Киева – Газета "ФАКТЫ и комментарии" |publisher=Fakty.ua |access-date=12 March 2013 |archive-date=19 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019081338/http://fakty.ua/140163-masshtabnoe-stroitelstvo |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.segodnya.ua/news/251194.html |title=Вторая кольцевая дорога вокруг Киева обойдется в $5-5,5 млрд. – Последние новости Киева – Однако в направлении окружной дороги уже вся земля выкуплена {{pipe}} СЕГОДНЯ |publisher=Segodnya.ua |date=27 June 2007 |access-date=12 March 2013 |archive-date=5 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201005113158/https://kiev.segodnya.ua/kiev/kpower/vtoraja-koltsevaja-doroha-vokruh-kieva-obojdetcja-v-5-5-5-mlrd-59823.html/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://korrespondent.net/kyiv/1259650-azarov-prognoziruet-nachalo-stroitelstva-vtoroj-kolcevoj-dorogi-vokrug-kieva-v-2012-godu |title=Азаров прогнозирует начало строительства второй кольцевой дороги вокруг Киева в 2012 году {{pipe}} Новости Киева |publisher=Korrespondent.net |access-date=12 March 2013 |archive-date=19 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019092254/http://korrespondent.net/kyiv/1259650-azarov-prognoziruet-nachalo-stroitelstva-vtoroj-kolcevoj-dorogi-vokrug-kieva-v-2012-godu |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2009, Kyiv's roads were in poor technical condition and maintained inadequately.<ref>[http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/203506.html Kyiv Administration: Roads Are In Poor Technical State Because They Have Reached End Of Their Service Lives And Annual Maintenance Volume Is Low] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616154750/http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/203506.html |date=16 June 2009 }}, [[Ukrainian News Agency]] (12 June 2009)</ref>

[[Traffic congestion|Traffic jam]]s and lack of parking space are growing problems for all road transport services in Kyiv.
[[File:Boryspil International Airport Kyiv.jpg|thumb|[[Boryspil International Airport]]]]

====Air transport====

Kyiv is served by two international passenger airports: the [[Boryspil International Airport|Boryspil Airport]] {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=off}} away, and the smaller, municipally owned [[Kyiv International Airport (Zhuliany)|Zhuliany Airport]] on the southern outskirts of the city. There are also the [[Hostomel Airport|Hostomel cargo airport]] and additional three operating [[airfield]]s facilitating the [[Antonov|Antonov aircraft manufacturing company]] and [[general aviation]].

====Railways====
[[File:Київ-Пасажирський DSC 5417.jpg|thumb|[[Kyiv-Pasazhyrskyi railway station|Kyiv-Pasazhyrskyi Railway Station]]]]
Railways are Kyiv's main mode of intracity- and suburban transportation. The city has a developed railroad infrastructure including a long-distance passenger station, 6 cargo stations, depots, and repairing facilities. However, this system still fails to meet the demand for passenger service. Particularly, the [[Kyiv-Pasazhyrskyi railway station]] is the city's only long-distance passenger terminal (''vokzal'').

Construction is underway for turning the large [[Darnytsia railway station]] on the left-bank part of Kyiv into a long-distance passenger hub, which may ease traffic at the central station.<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.archunion.com.ua/proekt-new-006.shtml Archunion.com.ua] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206120010/http://www.archunion.com.ua/proekt-new-006.shtml |date=6 February 2007 }}. Retrieved 20 June 2006.</ref> [[Bridges in Kyiv|Bridges over the Dnieper River]] are another problem restricting the development of city's railway system. Presently, only one rail bridge out of two is available for intense train traffic. A new combined rail-auto bridge is under construction, as a part of Darnytsia project.

In 2011, the Kyiv city administration established the new Urban Train for Kyiv. This service runs at standard 4- to 10-minute intervals throughout the day and follows a circular route around the city centre, which allows it to serve many of Kyiv's inner suburbs. Interchanges between the Kyiv Metro and Fast Tram exist at many of the urban train's station stops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ua.rian.ru/economy/20111004/78875513.html |title=Азаров запустил в Киеве городскую электричку {{pipe}} Экономика {{pipe}} РИА Новости – Украина |publisher=Ua.rian.ru |date=13 August 2012 |access-date=12 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425083357/http://ua.rian.ru/economy/20111004/78875513.html |archive-date=25 April 2012}}</ref>

Suburban 'Kyiv City Express' trains (colloquially known as ''[[Elektrichka|elektrychka]]'') are serviced by the publicly owned [[Ukrainian Railways]]. The suburban train service is fast, and unbeatably safe in terms of traffic accidents. But the trains are not reliable, as they may fall significantly behind schedule, may not be safe in terms of crime, and the ''elektrychka'' cars are poorly maintained and overcrowded in [[rush hour]]s.

There are nine ''elektrychka'' directions from Kyiv:<ref>{{Cite web |title=Мапа сполучень |url=https://kyivcityexpress.uz.gov.ua/map.html |website=Kyiv City Express |language=uk |access-date=21 November 2023 |archive-date=4 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230604142404/https://kyivcityexpress.uz.gov.ua/map.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

More than a dozen of ''elektrychka'' stops are within the city allowing residents of different neighborhoods to use the suburban trains.

===Energy===
