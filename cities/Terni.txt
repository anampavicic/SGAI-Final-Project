'''Terni''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɛər|n|i}} {{respell|TAIR|nee}}; {{IPA|it|ˈtɛrni|lang|It-Terni.ogg}}; {{langx|la|Interamna (Nahars)}}) is a city in the southern portion of the region of [[Umbria]], in [[Central Italy]]. It is near the border with [[Lazio]]. The city is the capital of the [[province of Terni]], located in the plain of the [[Nera (Tiber)|River Nera]]. It is {{convert|104|km|0|abbr=off}} northeast of [[Rome]] and 81&nbsp;km south of the regional capital, [[Perugia]].

The Latin name means "between-two-rivers", in reference to its location on the confluence of the Nera river ([[Umbrian language|Ancient Umbrian]] ''Nahar'', {{langx|la|Nār, Nahar}}) and the Serra stream. When disambiguation was needed, it was referred to as ''Interamna Nahars''.<ref>CIL XI 4213</ref> Its inhabitants were known in Latin as ''Interamnātēs Na(ha)rtēs''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Uggeri|first1=Giovanni (Florence)|last2=Buonocore|first2=Marco (Rome)|date=2006-10-01|title=Interamna|url=https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/interamna-e525250|journal=Brill's New Pauly|language=en}}</ref>

Interamna was founded as an Ancient Roman town, albeit settlements in the Terni area well precede this occurrence. During the 19th century, steel mills were introduced and led the city to have a role in the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] in Italy. Because of its industrial importance, the city was heavily bombed during [[World War II]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. It remains an industrial hub and has been nicknamed "The Steel City".

Terni is also known as the "City of Lovers", as its patron saint, [[Saint Valentine]], was born and became a bishop here, and the remains are preserved in the basilica-sanctuary in his honour.

==History==
{{Main articles|History of Terni, Umbria}}
The city was founded around the 7th century BC by the [[Umbrians]] ''Nahartes'', in a territory inhabited (as testified by archaeological excavations) as early as the [[Bronze Age]]. The [[Iguvine Tablets]] describe these ''Nahartes'' as a strong, numerous people and as the most important enemy of the Umbrian people of [[Gubbio]] (Iguvium). In the 3rd century BC, Terni was conquered by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and soon became an important ''municipium'' lying on the [[Via Flaminia]] and known under the name ''Interamna'', meaning "between-two-rivers".

In 271 BC the Roman consul [[Manius Curius Dentatus]] ordered the construction of a canal (the Curiano Trench) to divert the water from the marshes in the [[Rieti Valley]] and from Lake Velino over the natural cliff at [[Cascata delle Marmore|Marmore]], creating the waterfall. This caused flooding in the valley around Terni below. For a long time this became the cause of interminable quarrels between the cities of [[Rieti]] and Terni. The issue was so contentious between the two cities that the Roman Senate was forced to address it in 54 BC. [[Aulus Pompeius]] represented Terni, and [[Cicero]] represented Rieti. The [[Roman Senate|Senate]] did nothing about the problem, and the problem remained the same for centuries.

After the [[Lombards|Lombard]] conquest in 755, Terni lost prominence when it was reduced to a secondary town in the [[Duchy of Spoleto]]. In 1174, it was sacked by [[Frederick Barbarossa]]'s general, Archbishop [[Christian I (archbishop of Mainz)|Christian of Mainz]]. In the following century, Terni was one of the sites visited frequently by [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]] to give sermons.

In the 14th century Terni issued its own constitution, and from 1353 the walls were enlarged, and new channels were opened. As with many of the Italian communes of the Late Middle Ages, it was beset by civil unrest between the partisans of the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]], and later between the ''Nobili'' and ''Banderari'' (Terni's bourgeoisie). It later joined the [[Papal States]]. In 1580, an [[ironwork]], the Ferriera, was introduced to work the iron ore mined in [[Monteleone di Spoleto]], starting the traditional industrial connotation of the city. In the 17th century, however, the population of Terni declined further due to plagues and famines.

In the 19th century, Terni took advantage of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and of plentiful water sources in the area. New industries included a steelworks, a [[foundry]], as well as weapons, [[jute]] and wool factories. In 1927, Terni became capital of the province.

{{anchor|Allied air attacks}}The presence of important industries made the city a favorite target for the Allied bombardments in [[World War II]]. On August 11, 1943, a raid by 44 [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] bombers, which dropped 213 tons of bombs, devastated the city, killing 564 people. It was the first of the 57 airstrikes that destroyed or damaged 40% of Terni's buildings and killed 1,018 civilians. Despite this, industrial environment increased quickly after the war.<ref>{{Cite web |title=11 agosto 1943, alle 10.29 il primo bombardamento a Terni: il racconto di un tragico evento |trans-title=11 August 1943, at 10.29 the first bombing of Terni: the story of a tragic event |url=https://www.ternitoday.it/attualita/11-agosto-1943-racconto-tragico-evento-bombardamento-terni-2019.html |access-date=2023-05-14 |website=TerniToday |language=it}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last1=Gioannini |first1=Marco |last2=Massobrio |first2=Giulio |year=2007 |title=Bombardate l'Italia.

==Economy==
The city has three important industrial hubs: the first one is the [[Stainless steel|Stainless Steel]] Area, called AST (part of the group [[ThyssenKrupp]]) and is a wide area located in the east part of Terni. West of the town, there is a second industrial hub, known as "Area Polymer", with four different chemical multinational industries. The third industrial hub is Italeaf, which controls TerniEnergia, a company listed on STAR segment of [[Borsa Italiana]], that is active in the renewable energy sector, and promotes and develops technological start-ups in the [[Clean technology|cleantech]] sector.

==Transport==
Terni is connected with the [[Autostrada A1 (Italy)|A1 motorway]], the [[European route E45]] and [[Via Flaminia|National Road Flaminia]] by the ''RATO'', a motorway junction.

[[Terni railway station]] is part of the [[Ancona–Orte railway]], and is also a [[junction (rail)|junction station]] for two secondary lines, the [[Terni–Sulmona railway]] (which links Terni with [[L'Aquila railway station|L'Aquila]]) and the [[Terni–Sansepolcro railway]] (''FCU'') (which serves [[Perugia railway station|Perugia]]). One of the most important national freight stations is located nearby.
The local urban and suburban transport service, ATC, runs 90 bus lines. In the north of the city (Colleluna zone), there are works in progress on the line from Perugia to enable it to be used as a [[Light rail]] line.
