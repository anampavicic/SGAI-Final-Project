'''Incheon''' ({{Korean|hangul=인천}}; {{IPA|ko|intɕʰʌ̹n}}; or '''Inch'ŏn'''; literally "kind river"), formerly '''Jemulpo''' or '''Chemulp'o''' ({{Korean|hangul=제물포}}) until the period after 1910, officially the '''Incheon Metropolitan City''' ({{Korean|hangul=인천광역시|labels=no}}), is a city located in northwestern South Korea, bordering [[Seoul]] and [[Gyeonggi Province]] to the east. Inhabited since the [[Neolithic]], Incheon was home to just 4,700 people when it became an international port in 1883. Today<!-- February 2020 -->, about 3 million people live in the city, making it South Korea's third-most-populous city after [[Seoul]] and [[Busan]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://kosis.kr/statHtml/statHtml.do?orgId=101&tblId=DT_1IN1502&conn_path=I2&language=en | title=Population, Households and Housing Units | publisher=[[Statistics Korea]] | date=2022-07-28 | access-date=2023-01-25}}</ref>

The city's growth has been assured in modern times with the development of its port due to its natural advantages as a coastal city and its proximity to the South Korean capital. It is part of the [[Seoul Capital Area]], along with Seoul itself and [[Gyeonggi Province]], forming the world's fourth-largest [[List of metropolitan areas by population|metropolitan area by population]].

Incheon has since led the economic development of South Korea by opening its port to the outside world, ushering in the modernization of South Korea as a center of industrialization. In 2003, the city was designated as South Korea's first free economic zone.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bost |first=F. |title=World Free Zones Organization; Index cards by country; SOUTH KOREA |url=https://www.worldfzo.org/Portals/0/OpenContent/Files/487/South_Korea.pdf |access-date=15 April 2024 |website=World Free Zones Organization}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lee |first=Changwon |date=2005-12-01 |title=Development of Free Economic Zones and Labor Standards: A Case Study of Free Economic Zones in Korea |url=https://hdl.handle.net/1813/89761 |journal=DigitalCollections@ILR |hdl=1813/89761 |language=en-US}}</ref> Since then, large local companies and global enterprises have increasingly invested in the [[Incheon Free Economic Zone]], including [[Samsung]] which chose [[Songdo International Business District|Songdo]] International City as its new investment destination for its bio industry.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

As an international city, Incheon has held numerous large-scale international conferences, such as the [[Incheon Global Fair & Festival]] in 2009. The 17th [[2014 Asian Games|Asian Games Incheon 2014]] was also held in Incheon on 19 September 2014. Incheon is also a major transportation hub in northeast Asia, with [[Incheon International Airport]] and Incheon Port.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}} The large volume of port traffic makes Incheon a Large-Port Metropolis using the Southampton System of Port-City classification.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1080/03088839.2020.1802785 | title=The Southampton system: A new universal standard approach for port-city classification | year=2021 | last1=Roberts | first1=Toby | last2=Williams | first2=Ian | last3=Preston | first3=John | journal=Maritime Policy & Management | volume=48 | issue=4 | pages=530–542 | s2cid=225502755 | doi-access=free }}</ref>

==History==
The first historical record of the Incheon area dates back to 475 CE, during the reign of [[King Jangsu]] of [[Goguryeo]], by the name of '''Michuhol''', which is supposed to be located on today's Munhak Hill ({{lang|ko|문학산}}). The area underwent several name changes with successive kingdoms and dynasties. In [[Goryeo]] era, Incheon was called '''Gyeongwon''' ({{lang|ko|경원}}) or '''Inju''' ({{lang|ko|인주}}). The current name was turned to Incheon in 1413. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Later, Incheon County became Incheon Metropolitan Prefecture (dohobu, {{lang|ko|도호부}}). Old Incheon consisted of today's southern Incheon (i.e. Jung-gu, Dong-gu, Nam-gu, Yeonsu District, and Namdong District) and the northern part of [[Siheung]]. The city center was Gwangyo-dong, where the prefecture office ({{lang|ko|도호부청사}}) and the local academy (hyanggyo, {{lang|ko|향교}}) were located. The "original" two remaining buildings of the Incheon prefecture office are located in Munhak Elementary School, while the newly built (in 2001) prefecture office buildings are right across from [[Munhak Baseball Stadium]].

===Modern history===
[[File:Chemulpo (Incheon), 1890.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Jemulpo in 1890]]
Another historical name of the city, '''Jemulpo''' (alternatively Romanized as '''Chemulpo'''), was not widely used until the opening of the port in 1883. It was frequently used until the Japanese annexation.<ref>[http://english.incheon.go.kr/ Incheon Metropolitan City] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060107015749/http://english.incheon.go.kr/ |date=7 January 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Ewing |first=Stefan |url=http://koreaweb.ws/pipermail/koreanstudies_koreaweb.ws/2006-January/005354.html |title=By Train from Seoul to Incheon – and Jemulpo, too |publisher=Korea Web |date=25 January 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928035926/http://koreaweb.ws/pipermail/koreanstudies_koreaweb.ws/2006-January/005354.html |archive-date=28 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> After the opening of the Incheon port, the city center moved from Gwangyo to Jemulpo. Today, either Jemulpo or Gwangyo-dong is considered "Original Incheon" ({{lang|ko|원인천}}). It was internationally known as '''Jinsen''' during [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], based on the Japanese pronunciation of Incheon's Sino-Korean name.

In 1914, the Japanese colonial government merged outer parts of old Incheon (including the former center of Gwangyo) with [[Bupyeong District|Bupyeong]] County, forming [[Bucheon]] County.<ref>{{Cite web|title=GAMEON'ASIA 2015, March 25–27, 2015, Ghent University, Incheon, South-Korea, Conference Venue {{!}} EUROSIS|url=https://www.eurosis.org/cms/index.php?q=node/2980|access-date=2021-07-08|website=www.eurosis.org|archive-date=24 March 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220324001430/https://www.eurosis.org/cms/index.php?q=node%2F2980|url-status=live}}</ref> Between 1936 and 1940, some part of Bucheon County was recombined into Incheon City, by which some part of "old" Bupyeong was annexed into Incheon.

Incheon was originally part of [[Gyeonggido|Gyeonggi Province]], but was granted ''Directly Governed'' (now Metropolitan) City status on 1 July 1981; the city officially separated from the province. In 1989, neighboring islands and Gyeyang township of Gimpo County{{efn|Prior to 1973, the township belonged to Bucheon or old Bupyeong.}} were ceded to Incheon and in 1995 Geomdan township of Gimpo County and two counties of Ganghwa and Onjin were annexed to Incheon Metropolitan City.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

Incheon was known as '''Inchon''' prior to South Korea's adoption of a [[Revised Romanization of Korean|new Romanization system]] in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Herald |first=Korea |date=2022-03-02 |title=[Lee Kyong-hee] Romanization of Korean &ndash; alphabet buffet |url=https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220302000147 |access-date=2024-03-18 |website=[[The Korea Herald]] |language=en}}</ref>

=== Major events ===
The city was the site of the [[Battle of Chemulpo Bay]], where the first shots of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] were fired.

During the [[Korean War]], Incheon was occupied by North Korean troops on 4 July 1950. Incheon was the site of the [[Battle of Inchon]] when the United States troops landed to relieve pressure on the [[Pusan Perimeter]] and to launch a United Nations offensive northward. The result was a decisive UN victory and it was recaptured on 19 September 1950.<ref>Bill Sloan, ''The Darkest Summer: Pusan and Inchon 1950: The Battles That Saved South Korea—and the Marines—From Extinction''(2009)</ref> {{USS|Inchon||6}} was named after the tide-turning battle that ensued.

Prior to and during the [[June Democratic Struggle|June Democratic Movement]] in 1987, Incheon was the site of several pro-democracy protests.

Incheon has also hosted a series of major international events. The Global Fair & Festival 2009 Incheon was held in the Songdo District in August 2009. It was open from 7 August to 25 October for a period of 80 days. It was a comprehensive international event with global institutions and corporations as participants. Various musicians and artists performed during the event.

Incheon experiences each of its four seasons, distinctly feeling the rise and fall of temperature and humidity. The temperature however, never rises to an extreme, and the climate of the city is essentially mild.

==Economy==
Incheon forms the heart of Capital Industrial Region. During the industrialization of South Korea, several industrial complexes were built throughout the city, and as a result, the city was largely dependent on manufacturing industry. But with the designation of [[Incheon Free Economic Zone]] in 2003, the city is now making an effort to foster new growth industries. Major industrial parks include Bupyeong industrial complex, which hosts [[General Motors|GM]] Incheon plant(formerly a GM Daewoo Incheon plant), Juan industrial complex, and Namdong Industrial complex.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

In recent years, bio industry is emerging as a new growth industry of the city.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}} Currently, with the total production capacity of 330kℓ per year, the city ranks 2nd in the world by production capacity along with [[San Francisco]], United States.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}} The capacity is under expansion, and after completion in 2018, the city will rank 1st with the production capacity of 510kℓ.<ref>{{Cite news|script-title=ko:송도국제도시 세계 최대 바이오의약품 생산기지로 뜬다 |trans-title=Songdo International City becomes the world's largest biopharmaceutical production base |language=ko |date=12 October 2015 |url=http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2015/10/12/0200000000AKR20151012057700065.HTML? |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151014232338/http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2015/10/12/0200000000AKR20151012057700065.HTML |archive-date=14 October 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Also, [[logistics industry]] is also experiencing a rapid growth, thanks to [[Incheon Airport]], which was ranked fourth in the world by cargo traffic, and the expansion of Incheon Port.

==Transportation==
Incheon is a major domestic and international transport hub for Korea.

=== Air ===
[[Incheon International Airport]] is South Korea's primary international airport and a regional air hub. In 2015, it was the world's 22nd busiest airport by passenger traffic, with 49,412,750 passengers.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Year to date Passenger Traffic: December 2015 |publisher=Airports Council International (ACI) |url=http://www.aci.aero/Data-Centre/Monthly-Traffic-Data/Passenger-Summary/Year-to-date |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129021001/http://www.aci.aero/Data-Centre/Monthly-Traffic-Data/Passenger-Summary/Year-to-date |archive-date=29 January 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Sea ===
Incheon's sea port is the second largest port in Korea after [[Busan Port]].

The International Passenger Terminal located at the port offers ferries to five cities in [[China]]: [[Dalian]], [[Qingdao]], [[Tianjin]], [[Dandong]], and [[Weihai]]. There are also ferries to Incheon's outlying islands as well as [[Baengnyeong Island]] inside of the [[Northern Limit Line]].

=== Buses ===
[[Incheon Bus Terminal]], located at its eponymous subway stop, offers express bus transportation to all parts of Korea. Many city bus lines offer transportation within city limits as well as to the neighboring cities of [[Bucheon]], [[Gimpo]], [[Seoul]], and [[Siheung]].

Local service to [[Guro station|Guro]], [[Seoul Station|Seoul]], [[Cheongnyangni Station (underground)|Cheongnyangni]], [[Uijeongbu station|Uijeongbu]] and [[Soyosan station|Soyosan]] is offered by Seoul's subway [[Seoul Subway Line 1|Line 1]]. The line has 11 stations within Incheon and connects to the Incheon Subway at Bupyeong and Juan stations.

Rapid service on the same line to [[Yongsan station]] in Seoul depart from Dongincheon station and stops at major stations.

The Airport Express ([[AREX]]) line runs from [[Incheon International Airport]] to [[Seoul Station]] via [[Gimpo International Airport]]. The Incheon-Gimpo section was opened in March 2007 and was extended to Seoul station in December 2010.

{{Main|Incheon Subway}}
[[File:Incheon Airport Maglev.jpg|thumb|left|[[Incheon Airport Maglev]]]] 
The Incheon Subway has two subway lines serving the city.

It connects [[International Business District station]] in [[Songdo International Business District|Songdo]] to Gyeyang station. The line has 28 stations on {{convert|29.4|km|1|abbr=off}} of track. The line also has transfer stations with the [[Suin Line]] at [[Woninjae station]], with the [[Incheon Subway Line 2]] at [[Incheon City Hall station]], and with [[Seoul Subway Line 7]] at [[Bupyeong-gu Office station]]. [[Incheon Subway Line 2]] opened in July 2016 and runs from Geomdan Oryu station to Unyeon station. The automated line is {{convert|29.2|km|1|abbr=off}} long, and has 27 stations, including transfer stations at [[Geomam station]] with the [[AREX]] line, [[Juan station]] with [[Seoul Subway Line 1]] and [[Incheon Subway Line 2]] at [[Incheon City Hall station]].
