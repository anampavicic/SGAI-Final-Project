Providence was settled in June 1636 by [[Puritan]] theologian [[Roger Williams]] and grew into one of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]]. As a minister in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], Williams had advocated the [[Separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]] and condemned colonists' confiscation of land from the Indians. For these and other "diverse, new, and dangerous opinions," he was convicted of sedition and heresy and banished from the colony.

Providence lacked a royal charter, unlike [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] and Boston. The settlers thus organized themselves, allotting tracts on the eastern side of the Providence River in 1638 allowing roughly six acres each. These home lots extended from Towne Street (now South Main Street) to Hope Street.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Roger Williams: In Providence – Roger Williams National Memorial (U.S. National Park Service)|url=https://www.nps.gov/rowi/learn/historyculture/inprovidence.htm|access-date=October 16, 2020|website=nps.gov|language=en|archive-date=October 17, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201017201753/https://www.nps.gov/rowi/learn/historyculture/inprovidence.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> Over the following two decades, Providence Plantations grew into a self-sufficient agricultural and fishing settlement, though its lands were difficult to farm and its borders were disputed with Connecticut and Massachusetts.<ref name="3.5-centuries"/>

In 1652, Providence prohibited indentured servitude for periods of longer than 10 years. This statute constituted the first anti-slavery law in the United States, though there is no evidence the prohibition was ever enforced.<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=America's First Anti-Slavery Statute Was Passed in 1652.

The economy shifted from maritime endeavors to manufacturing, in particular machinery, tools, silverware, jewelry, and textiles. By the start of the 20th century, Providence hosted some of the largest manufacturing plants in the country, including [[Brown & Sharpe]], [[Nicholson File Company Mill Complex|Nicholson File]], and [[Gorham Manufacturing Company]].<ref name="3.5-centuries" /> The city's industries attracted many immigrants from Ireland, Germany, Sweden, England, Italy, Portugal, Cape Verde, and French Canada.

Local politics split over slavery during the [[American Civil War]], as many had ties to Southern cotton and the slave trade. Despite ambivalence concerning the war, the number of military volunteers routinely exceeded quota, and the city's manufacturing proved invaluable to the Union.

Geographically, Providence is compact—characteristic of [[East Coast of the United States|eastern seaboard]] cities that developed prior to use of the automobile. The street layout of the city is irregular; more than one thousand streets run haphazardly, connecting and radiating from traditionally bustling places such as [[Market Square, Providence, Rhode Island|Market Square]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~rigenweb/Providence/article271.html|publisher=USGenWeb Project|title=History of the State of Rhode Island with Illustrations|author=Albert J.

Downtown Providence has numerous 19th-century mercantile buildings in the [[Federal style architecture|Federal]] and [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] architectural styles, as well as several [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]] and modernist buildings. In particular, a fairly clear spatial separation appears between the areas of pre-1980s development and post-1980s development; West Exchange Street and Exchange Terrace serve as rough boundaries between the two.<ref name=mckenzie/> The newer area, sometimes called "Capitol Center",<ref name=mckenzie>{{cite book |last=Woodward |first=William McKenzie |title=PPS/AIAri Guide to Providence Architecture |year=2003 |publisher=Providence Preservation Society |location=Providence, Rhode Island |isbn=0-9742847-0-X |pages=303–304}}</ref> includes the [[Providence Place Mall]] (1999), [[Omni Providence Hotel]] (1993) and [[The Residences Providence|Residences Providence]] (2007), [[GTECH Corporation]] (2006), [[Waterplace Towers]] condominiums (2007), and [[Waterplace Park]] (1994).

The streetscape of much of historic downtown has retained a similar appearance since the early 20th century. Many of the state's tallest buildings are found here. At 426 feet (130 m), the city's [[List of tallest buildings in Providence|largest structure]] is the [[art deco]] [[Industrial National Bank Building]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=125380|title=Bank of America Building, Providence|publisher=Emporis|year=2007|access-date=January 19, 2007|archive-date=October 22, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022031646/http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=125380|url-status=usurped}}</ref> The building contrasts with the city's second tallest structure—[[One Financial Plaza]]—which is designed in the modernist style.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=125377 |title=One Financial Plaza |year=2006 |publisher=Emporis |access-date=June 5, 2006 |archive-date=September 25, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925144210/http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=125377 |url-status=usurped }}</ref> Other core buildings of the Providence skyline are the postmodern [[50 Kennedy Plaza]] and late modern [[Textron Tower]].

The city's southern waterfront, away from the downtown core, is the location of oil tanks, ferry and sailing docks, power plants, and nightclubs. The [[Soviet submarine K-77|Russian Submarine Museum]] was located here until 2008, when the submarine sank. The [[Fox Point Hurricane Barrier]] is also found here, built to protect Providence from [[storm surge]] like those endured by the city during the [[New England Hurricane of 1938|1938 New England Hurricane]] and 1954 [[Hurricane Carol]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.providencebiltmore.com/history.htm|publisher=The Providence Biltimore|title=History: A Rhode Island Tradition|access-date=July 11, 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012203235/http://www.providencebiltmore.com/history.htm |archive-date = October 12, 2007}}</ref>
