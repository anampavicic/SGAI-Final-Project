The main city was moved six times until in 1879 it reached its present-day location at Nuang Kaw. Khon Kaen was under the governance of Udon in the early period of Rattanakosin, c. 2450 BCE. [[The Integrated Opisthorchiasis Control Program]], also known as the Lawa Project, an internationally recognized [[liver fluke]] control program, has its offices in the Ban Phai and Ban Haet Districts south of Khon Kaen city.
