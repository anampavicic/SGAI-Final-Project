Located at the confluence of the [[Saksahan]] and [[Inhulets river|Inhulets]] rivers, Kryvyi Rih was founded as a military [[Stage station|staging post]] in 1775. Urban-industrial growth followed [[Belgium|Belgian]], [[France|French]] and [[UK|British]] [[investment]] in the exploitation of the area's rich [[iron ore|iron-ore]] deposits, generally called [[Kryvbas]], in the 1880s. Kryvyi Rih gained city status after the [[October Revolution]] in 1919.

[[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]-era industrialisation built [[Kryvorizhstal]] in 1934, the largest integrated metallurgical works in the Soviet Union. After a brutal German occupation in [[World War II]], Kryvyi Rih experienced renewed growth through to the 1970s. The economic dislocation associated with the break-up of the [[Soviet Union]] contributed to high unemployment and a large-scale exodus from the city in the 1990s. The [[privatization]] of [[Kryvorizhstal]] in 2005 was followed by increased foreign and private investment which helped finance urban regeneration. Beginning in 2017, there were major labour protests and strikes.

Since the beginning of the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]] in February 2022, Kryvyi Rih has been the target of [[Kryvyi Rih strikes (2022–present)|frequent Russian missile strikes]]. It was a focus of the [[southern Ukraine campaign]], but the closest ground advance by [[Russia]] stalled some {{Convert|50|km|mi}} to the south of the city before it was turned back in March 2022.

Kryvyi Rih, which in Ukrainian literally means 'crooked [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]]' or 'curved cape', was the name originally given in the 18th century to the general area of the present city by [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]]. According to local legend, the first village in the area was founded by a "crooked" ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] slang for 'one-eyed') Cossack named ''Rih'' (literally, 'horn'). The name likely derives from the shape of the landmass formed by the [[confluence]] of the river [[Saksahan]] with the [[Inhulets]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kryvyirih.dp.ua/ru/st/pg/241109205040551_s/ |title=Комаров В.О.

==History==
===Early history===
{{see also|Liquidation of the Zaporozhian Sich}}
In 1734 the Cossack [[Zaporizhian Sich]] (or Host) incorporated the area within the Inhul Palanka division of their ''de-facto'' republic. A list of villages and winter camps (zymivnyki) from that time mentions Kryvyi Rih. In 1770, Kryvyi Rih was again recorded as the camp of the [[Zaporizhian Sich]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Історична хроніка подій 1734-1900.

In May 1775, after the end of the [[Russian-Turkish War]], [[Russian Empire|Russian authorities]] established Kryvyi Rih as a staging post, in the tradition of the [[Mongols|Mongol]] [[Yam (route)|yam]], on the roads to the Russian garrisons of [[Kremenchuk]], [[Kinburn Spit|Kinburn foreland]] and [[Ochakov]].<ref>Перелік (Списку) казенних селищ Херсонського й Олександрійського повітів, які у 1816 - 1817 р.р. були звернені у військові поселення (''tr.

===Industrial growth===
[[Alexander Pol]] discovered and initiated iron ore investigation and production in this area.

In 1880, with 5 million [[franc]]s of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], Pol founded the "French Society of Kryvyi Rih Ores". In 1882 16.4 thousand tons of ore were extracted from surface mines on the outskirts of town by 150 workers.

=== Russian Civil War ===
In the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] that followed the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]] of October 1917, Kryvyi Rih changed hands several times.

==== Labour protests ====
Beginning in 2017, Kryvyi Rih had major labour unrest. In May 2017, coordinated protest actions began at the city's main plants, Kryvyi Rih Iron Ore Plant, Evraz-Sukha Balka and AMKR. Employees stopped work, held public meetings and occupied administration offices. Conscious that they were receiving one of the lowest wages across the global industry, the metalworkers raised the demand for a monthly wage of US$1,000/Euros. The conflict stopped after an agreement was reached to gradually raise wages, on average by 50%. In 2018, protest erupted again triggered by the fatal result of underinvestment in plant and safety. On the night of 3–4 March 2018, the roof collapsed at AMKR's converter shop, killing a 25-year-old worker.<ref>{{Cite web |title=How workers in Ukraine's metal industry are fighting for wages, rights and democracy |url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/how-workers-in-ukraine-metal-industry-are-fighting-for-wages-rights-democracy/ |access-date=2022-03-18 |website=openDemocracy |language=en |archive-date=2022-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220318153552/https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/how-workers-in-ukraine-metal-industry-are-fighting-for-wages-rights-democracy/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In May, the [[ArcelorMittal]] steel plant ground to a halt as workers refused to guide trains along the factory's self-enclosed supply chain until they received monthly pay of 1,000 euros. Management brought in employees from state-owned railway company Ukrzaliznytsia to run the factory, breaking the strike but leaving the central dispute in place. An underlying problem, according to ArcelorMittal's chief procurement officer, is a labour shortage. Skilled workers are emigrating to [[Poland]], [[Czech Republic|Czechia]], and to other countries. But the plant's upper management sees costs associated with the higher salaries that might retain workers as an unacceptable threat to an ambitious, multibillion-dollar factory modernization project.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last1=Kovensky |first1=Josh |last2=Chernichkin |first2=Kostyantyn |date=2018-06-28 |title=ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih plant rattled by strikes (VIDEO) - Jun. 28, 2018 |url=https://www.kyivpost.com/business/arcelormittal-kryvyi-rih-plant-rattled-by-strikes.html |access-date=2022-03-18 |website=KyivPost |archive-date=2022-12-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221226095734/https://www.kyivpost.com/business/arcelormittal-kryvyi-rih-plant-rattled-by-strikes.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Kryvorizhstal]], Ukraine's largest integrated steel company, had been privatised in 2005 in publicly televised auction. This was after the incoming government of President [[Viktor Yushchenko]] cancelled a 2004 auction that had seen the company sold at a much lower price, to a consortium that included the son-in-law of ex-President [[Leonid Kuchma]].

==== Russian invasion ====
{{Main|2022 bombing of Kryvyi Rih}}
On the first day of the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|invasion of Ukraine by Russia]], 24 February 2022, there were air strikes against military targets in the city, causing evacuations of residents in the district of Makulan.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kryvyi Rih city's residents being evacuated after air attacks on warehouses of armored brigade |url=https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-defense/3411212-kryvyi-rih-citys-residents-being-evacuated-after-air-attacks-on-armored-brigade-warehouses.html |access-date=2022-03-18 |website=www.ukrinform.net |date=24 February 2022 |language=en |archive-date=2022-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220318155429/https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-defense/3411212-kryvyi-rih-citys-residents-being-evacuated-after-air-attacks-on-armored-brigade-warehouses.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

An [[Ilyushin Il-76|Ilyushin Il 76]] transport had approached an abandoned Soviet-era air base just east of the city. Carrying more than 100 paratroopers with orders to capture the airfield as an “air bridge”, it was forced to abort its mission, 300 metres from landing. As soon as the city had been hit with missiles, local defenders had blocked the runway with mechanical equipment.<ref name=":9" /><ref name=":10" /> On the same day, Vilkul said that he had received a phone call from a former colleague who invited him to "sign an agreement of friendship, cooperation and defense with Russia"; he said that he "responded with profanity."<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/07/world/europe/russia-putin-ukraine-politicians.html |title=Russia's Grave Miscalculation: Ukrainians Would Collaborate |newspaper=The New York Times |date=7 May 2022 |last1=Kramer |first1=Andrew E. |access-date=8 May 2022 |archive-date=8 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220508021928/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/07/world/europe/russia-putin-ukraine-politicians.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

On the third day of the war, 27 February, the Russian forces, according to Vilkul, sent a column of 300 military vehicles from their advancing position to the south, and that after ten days of intense fighting they were turned back. As an industrial center that accounted for fully 10% of Ukraine's GDP, Vilkul was convinced that Kryvyi Rih was a prime target for Russian forces.<ref>{{Cite web |last=von Hackensberger |first=Alfred |date=2022-04-09 |title=A Visit To Zelensky's Hometown, As Russians May Be Set To Attack Again |url=https://worldcrunch.com/world-affairs/zelensky-hometown-eastern-ukraine/particle-7 |access-date=2022-04-11 |website=Die Welt/Wordcrunch |language=en |archive-date=2022-04-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220422011636/https://worldcrunch.com/world-affairs/zelensky-hometown-eastern-ukraine/particle-7 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The city of Kryvyi Rih is governed by the [[Kryvyi Rih City Council|Kryvyi Rih Municipality]]. It is a city community that is designated as a separate district within its [[oblast]].

Administratively, the city is divided into [[Urban districts of Ukraine|districts]] (''raions''). There are 7 districts: Metalurhiinyi, Tsentralno-Miskyi, Ternivskyi, Saksahanskyi, Inhuletskyi, Pokrovskyi and Dovhyntsivskyi. Small townships, Avanhard, Horniatske, Ternuvatyi Kut, Kolomiitseve and Novoivanivka were added to the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kryvyirih.dp.ua/karta_saytu_mistseva_vlada |title=Виконком міської ради. |publisher=kryvyirih.dp.ua |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102005537/http://kryvyirih.dp.ua/karta_saytu_mistseva_vlada |archive-date=2014-11-02 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1775, the Inhulets Povit (territory) of [[Novorossiysk Governorate]] was established on lands of the Inhulets palanca, after the abolition of the [[Zaporozhian Sich]]. In 1775/1776 it was part of [[Kherson Governorate]]. In 1783, the povit centre became Kryvyi Rih, and it was renamed "Kryvyi Rih Povit". In 1860, Kryvyi Rih received the status of township within the [[Kherson Governorate]]. In 1919, the township was granted city status in [[Yekaterinoslav Governorate]] and, later, [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]]. As a result of the administrative reform in 1923, Kryvyi Rih povit converted to Kryvyi Rih county. In 1930, it became an independent administrative
unit of Ukraine.<ref>Волости и важнѣйшія селенія Европейской Россіи.

Kryvyi Rih has four single-mandate [[Electoral district|parliamentary constituencies]] entirely within the city, through which members of parliament (MPs) are elected to represent the city in [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukraine's national parliament]]. At the [[2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election]], they were won by [[Petro Poroshenko Bloc]] and independent candidates with representation being from Yuri Pavlov, Andriy Halchenko, [[Konstantin Usov]] respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.golos.com.ua/Article.aspx?id=362038 |title=СПИСОК народних депутатів України, обраних на позачергових виборах народних депутатів України 26 жовтня 2014 року |publisher=«Голос України». — № 218 (5968). — 2014. — 12 листопада. — С. 4–9 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20141127122028/http://www.golos.com.ua/Article.aspx?id=362038 |archive-date=2014-11-27}}</ref>

Kryvyi Rih has a thriving theatre, circus and dance scene, and is home to a number of large performance venues. There are also the Doll Theatre and Movement Theatre.
The first theater was the Coliseum, built in 1908. The New Theatre of Vyzenberh and Hrushevskyy followed in 1911, at the corner of Lenina and Kalynychenko streets. Kryvbas Theatre began its activities in 1931, and three years later was incorporated with the Shevchenko Theater.

Kryvyi Rih is noted as the birthplace [[Eugenie Gershoy]]. She emigrated to the United States with her family in 1903, and there became an American sculptor and watercolorist. Gershoy's work is in the collections of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], and the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]. Her papers are held at [[Syracuse University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.syr.edu/digital/guides/g/gershoy_e.htm |title=Eugenie Gershoy Papers: An inventory of her papers at Syracuse University |access-date=10 January 2017 |archive-date=30 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030140230/http://library.syr.edu/digital/guides/g/gershoy_e.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Indie band [[Brunettes Shoot Blondes]], folk musician [[Eduard Drach]], actress [[Helena Makowska]], and dancer [[Vladimir Malakhov (dancer)|Vladimir Malakhov]] originated from the city.

==Landmarks==
Kryvyi Rih's buildings display a variety of architectural styles, ranging from [[eclecticism]] to [[contemporary architecture]]. The widespread use of red brick and block apartments characterize the city. Much of the architecture in the city was built during its prosperous days as a center for the ore trade. Just outside the immediate city center is a large number of former factories. Some have been totally destroyed. Others are in desperate need of restoration.

[[Stalinist architecture]] was the predominant style of postwar apartments, of 5 to 7 stories. City Hall is the best example of [[Stalinist architecture|The decree On liquidation of excesses]].<ref>''Architecture of The Stalin Era'', by Alexei Tarkhanov (Collaborator), Sergei Kavtaradze (Collaborator), Mikhail Anikst (Designer), 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-8478-1473-2}}</ref> [[Khrushchyovka]] are a type of low-cost, concrete-paneled or brick three- to five-storied apartment building which was developed in the USSR during the early 1960s. They are named after [[Nikita Khrushchev]], then premier of the Soviet government. Dozens of these aging buildings around the city are now past their design lifetime.

Kryvyi Rih has six [[microdistrict]]s.

The city has many [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)|Christian churches]], the most notable being the Savior Transfiguration Cathedral of the Ukrainian Orthodox church in union with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. It is the base of the [[Kryvyi Rih Eparchy]], which was established in July 1996.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eparhia.com.ua/?p=3 |title=» Епархия |access-date=10 January 2017 |archive-date=22 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822062927/http://www.eparhia.com.ua/?p=3 |url-status=dead}}</ref> A Roman Catholic chapel located in the old town, Pokrova church, Mykhailivska church and Christmas church were destroyed in the 1930s during the [[Great Purge]], never to be used as a church again.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://1775.dp.ua/istoriya-ss/pravoslavnye-hramy |title=Православные храмы - История Кривого Рога - 1775.dp.ua |access-date=10 January 2017 |archive-date=10 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110234859/http://1775.dp.ua/istoriya-ss/pravoslavnye-hramy |url-status=dead}}</ref> Beside the Russian jurisdiction, in 2009 to 2011 there existed parallel eparchy of the [[Orthodox Church of Ukraine]] (as the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kyivan Patriarchate]]).

In 2010, the [[Judaism in Ukraine|Jewish community]] built a new, large synagogue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jewish-museum-marmer.dp.ua/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2&Itemid=1 |title=Главная страница |first=Поддубная |last=Светлана |access-date=10 January 2017 |archive-date=19 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150719090742/http://jewish-museum-marmer.dp.ua/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2&Itemid=1 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://ru.tsn.ua/ukrayina/v-krivom-roge-otkryli-odnu-iz-krupneyshih-sinagog-v-vostochnoy-evrope.html |title=В Кривом Роге открыли одну из крупнейших синагог в Восточной Европе |access-date=10 January 2017 |archive-date=28 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181128164534/https://ru.tsn.ua/ukrayina/v-krivom-roge-otkryli-odnu-iz-krupneyshih-sinagog-v-vostochnoy-evrope.html |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Large parks hold many of Kryvyi Rih's public monuments. There are numerous [[socialist realism]]-style monuments installed in the Soviet years to honor Cossacks, [[Olexander Paul]], [[Taras Shevchenko]] (2), [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] (3, since 1954), Vasili Marguelov, [[Alexander Pushkin]], [[Fyodor Sergeyev]], [[Mikhail Lermontov]], and [[Maxim Gorky]]. The few [[Lenin]] monuments were destroyed during [[euromaidan]] events in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.itar-tass.com/world/759365 |title=Vandals continue demolition of monuments to Vladimir Lenin in Ukraine |access-date=10 January 2017 |archive-date=29 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129073917/http://en.itar-tass.com/world/759365 |url-status=live }}</ref> Dozens of [[cenotaph]]s and memorials to [[Second World War]] soldiers were erected. A [[Sukhoi Su-15]] is on display near the Aviator Club, a [[Yakovlev Yak-40]] at the [[National Aviation University]], Vyzvolennia Square holds a [[IS tank family|IS3]] tank, and a [[Russian locomotive class Ye]] is placed near the [[Kryvyi Rih Main Station|Railway station]].

==Geography==
[[File:Скалы МОПРа.jpg|thumb|MOPR/MODR ([[International Red Aid]]) city area rocks]]
[[File:Kryvyi rih roads and signs.jpg|thumbnail|Red-colored ground is common because of the [[iron oxide]]s.]]
Located {{convert|316|km|mi|sigfig=2}} south of [[Kyiv]], the city is the biggest by size within the [[Central Ukraine]] and being situated in the right-bank portion of [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]]. In addition, the city is located right on the conditional border where [[Dnieper Upland]] transitions to [[Black Sea Lowland]]. The Dnieper Upland is part of the [[Ukrainian Shield|Ukrainian Crystalline Shield]] which in the region contains number of [[Heavy metals|heavy metal]] deposits such as iron and uranium ores and [[hard rock deposits]] like [[granite]]. Combination of the crystalline shield with the near flowing river of [[Dnieper]] causes the plain-relief river looking as mountainous and running through rapids ([[Dnieper rapids]]).

Also, the city is often claimed to be the longest in Europe. It is said up to 100&nbsp;km<ref name="arnika" /> or even {{convert|126|km|mi|sigfig=2}} <ref name="bryzetskyi" /> from north to south. While the city is strikingly elongated on a map, in reality the greatest distance between two points within city limits is 66.1&nbsp;km. The longer figures result from drawing a line precisely following the heavily indented city limits from north to south.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cityblog.com.ua/2013/04/krivoy-rog-samyiy-dlinnyiy-gorod-v-evrope-mif-ili-realnost/ |title=Кривой Рог – самый длинный город в Европе.

The city area is not contiguous, with part of the [[Inhuletskyi District|Inhulets District]] being an exclave to the city proper. There isn't a continuous built up area along the full length of the city. Kryvyi Rih's shape is influenced by the [[ore]] [[deposition (geology)|deposit]]s which lie parallel to it and which have been the city's mining mainstay. The city centre is on the east bank of the [[Inhulets River]], near its confluences with its tributary river [[Saksahan]]. Both Inhulets and Saksahan change their river course in the area often bending in each direction. The [[confluence]] of the river [[Saksahan]] with the [[Inhulets]] supposedly gave the name for the city by forming a geographical crooked horn ("kryvyi rih").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kryvyirih.dp.ua/ru/st/pg/241109205040551_s/ |title=Комаров В.О.

The city is set in the rolling steppe land surrounded by fields of sunflowers and grain. A short distance east of the city center, there is an area along a small lake where glacial boulders were deposited. As a result, this area was never cultivated and contains one of the few remaining patches of wild [[steppe]] vegetation in the area. The city's [[natural environment|environmental]] and [[construction]] [[safety]] is a growing problem due to abandoned [[Mining|mines]] and [[pollution|polluted]] ore-processing [[waste]].

===Climate===
Kryvyi Rih has a dry warm [[Humid continental climate#Koppen Dfa|hot-summer continental climate (''Dfa'')]] within to the Köppen climate classification system, like much of southern Ukraine. This tends to generate warm summers and cold winters with relatively low precipitation. Snowfalls are not common in the city, due to the urban warming effect. Districts that surround the city receive more snow and roads leading out of the city can be closed<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nbnews.com.ua/ru/news/111848/ |title=Независимое бюро новостей - Из-за сильных снегопадов заблокировано движение в четырех областях Украины |first=Независимое бюро |last=новостей |access-date=10 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229112224/http://nbnews.com.ua/ru/news/111848/ |archive-date=29 December 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref> due to snow.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.0564.ua/news/110563 |title=Кривой Рог встретил снегопад во всеоружии? |access-date=10 January 2017 |archive-date=9 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809000038/http://www.0564.ua/news/110563 |url-status=live }}</ref>
