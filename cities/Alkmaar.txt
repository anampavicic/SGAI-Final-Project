'''Alkmaar''' ({{IPA|nl|ˈɑl(ə)kmaːr|-|Nl-Alkmaar.ogg}}) is a [[List of cities in the Netherlands by province|city]] and [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] in the [[Netherlands]], located in the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[North Holland]]. Alkmaar is well known for its traditional cheese market. For tourists, it is a popular cultural destination. The municipality has a population of 111,766 as of 2023.<ref name="pop" />

==History==

The earliest mention of the name Alkmaar is in a 10th-century document. As the village grew into a town, it was granted [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]] in 1254. The oldest part of Alkmaar lies on an ancient sand bank a couple of meters (yards) above the surrounding region; it afforded some protection from [[inundation]] during [[medieval]] times. Its vicinage consists of some of the [[Achtermeer|oldest]] [[polders]] in existence. Older spellings include '''Alckmar'''.<ref>Amsterdam Museum, Amsterdam</ref>

On June 24, 1572, after the [[Geuzen]] captured the town, five [[Franciscans]] from Alkmaar were taken to [[Enkhuizen]] and hanged, becoming the [[martyrs of Alkmaar]].

===Siege of Alkmaar===
In 1573 the city underwent a [[Siege of Alkmaar|siege]] by Spanish forces under the leadership of [[Fadrique Álvarez de Toledo, 4th Duke of Alba|Don Fadrique]], son of the [[Duke of Alva]]. The citizens sent urgent messages for help to the [[Prince of Orange]]; he responded by promising to open the floodgates of the dykes and flood the region if the need arose, which despite the protestations of the peasantry, fearful for their harvest, he proceeded to do.

Some of his dispatches fell into the hands of Don Fadrique, and, with the waters beginning to rise, the Spaniards raised the siege and fled.  It was a turning point in the [[Eighty Years War]] and gave rise to the expression ''Bij Alkmaar begint de victorie'' ("Victory begins at Alkmaar"). The event is still celebrated every year in Alkmaar on 8 October, the day the siege ended.

===Since the French Revolutionary Wars===
In 1799, during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], an Anglo-Russian expeditionary force captured the city but was ultimately defeated in the [[Battle of Castricum]]. After that battle, on 18 October 1799, the two opposing sides held the [[Convention of Alkmaar]] which met to determine the fate of the defeated Anglo-Russian force. The French victory was commemorated on the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in [[Paris]] as "Alkmaer".

The [[Noordhollandsch Kanaal|North Holland Canal]], opened in 1824, was dug through Alkmaar. In 1865 and 1867 the railways between Alkmaar and Den Helder and between Alkmaar and Haarlem were built respectively.

In the second half of the 20th century, Alkmaar expanded quickly with development of new neighbourhoods. On 1 October 1972, the town of Oudorp and the southern portions of Koedijk and Sint Pancras were added to the municipality of Alkmaar.<ref>{{Repertorium Nederlandse Gemeenten}}</ref>

The municipality of Alkmaar historically consists of the following cities, towns, villages and districts: Alkmaar, Bergermeer, Daalmeer, De Hoef, De Horn, De Nollen, Het Rak, Huiswaard, [[Koedijk]] (southeastern part), Overdie, [[Oudorp]] and Omval. On 1 January 2015 the municipalities of [[Graft-De Rijp]] and [[Schermer]] were merged into Alkmaar. The historical village of [[De Rijp]] is thus since a part of Alkmaar.

These once separate villages are now all linked together by the suburban sprawl of buildings that arose between the late 1970s and early 1990s. During this time, the population of Alkmaar almost doubled.

==Local government==
The municipal council of Alkmaar consists of 39 seats, which are divided as follows after the 2022 elections:<ref>{{cite web |date=2022-03-16 |title=Definitieve uitslag Gemeenteraadsverkiezingen 2022 - gemeente Alkmaar |url=https://verkiezingsuitslagen.nl/verkiezingen/detail/GR20220316/731123 |access-date=2023-01-17 |website=Kiesraad Databank Verkiezingsuitslagen}}</ref>

The [[A9 motorway (Netherlands)|A9 motorway]] runs from [[Amsterdam]] to Alkmaar, then continues on to [[Den Helder]] as the N9.

There are direct trains to [[Den Helder]], [[Hoorn]], [[Zaandam]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], [[Ede, Netherlands|Ede]], [[Arnhem]], [[Nijmegen]], [['s-Hertogenbosch]], [[Eindhoven]], [[Maastricht]] and [[Haarlem]]. For exact details see [[Alkmaar railway station]].

Alkmaar has two railway stations:

* [[Alkmaar railway station|Alkmaar]]
* [[Alkmaar Noord railway station|Alkmaar Noord]]

The waterway [[Noordhollandsch Kanaal]], which opened in 1824, runs through Alkmaar. {{As of|2017}}. it can be crossed (among other ways) using two of the five operating [[vlotbruggen]], Koedijkervlotbrug and Rekervlotbrug.

==Main sights==
Alkmaar has many medieval buildings that are still intact, most notably the tall tower of the [[Grote or Sint-Laurenskerk (Alkmaar)|Grote or Sint-Laurenskerk]], where many people from Alkmaar hold wedding ceremonies. The other main attraction, especially in the summer months, is Alkmaar's cheese market at the Waagplein, one of the country's most popular tourist attractions.  The cheese market traditionally takes place from the first Friday in April through the first Friday in September. Every Friday morning (10:00–12:30) the Waagplein is the backdrop for this traditional cheese market. After the old-fashioned way of the hand clap, traders and carriers will weigh the cheeses. It is one of only four traditional [[Dutch cheese markets]] still in existence. The traditional fare of this cheese market is those cheeses made in the local area, as opposed to the well-known brands of Dutch cheeses, including the [[Edam cheese|Edam]] and [[Gouda cheese]]s. It is not actually possible to buy cheese at the market itself, which is really only a demonstration of how this merchants' market operated in times gone by.  However, the demonstration, which takes place in front of the medieval weighing house, is surrounded by many specialized stalls where it is possible to buy all kinds of cheese (and non-cheese) related products. The [[weigh house|Waag]] is also home to the local tourist office and a cheese museum. Alkmaar has 399 registered [[rijksmonument]]s, of which most are situated along the city's old canals.<ref>[[:nl:Lijst van rijksmonumenten in Alkmaar]].</ref>

Alkmaar has two large theatres and a big cinema (which was originally two cinemas). A [[red light district]] is situated at the [[Achterdam]], and Alkmaar has a nightlife scene as well which takes place in the pubs in front of the cheesemarket. Every year, at the end of May Alkmaar hosts the four-day event Alkmaar Pride, which has a [[pride parade|canal pride parade]] on Saturday.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alkmaarpride.nl/ |title=Home |website=alkmaarpride.nl}}</ref>

==Sports==
[[File:AFAS stadion.jpg|thumb|left|[[AFAS Stadion]]]]
Alkmaar is home to the professional [[football (soccer)|football]] team [[AZ Alkmaar|AZ]] (Alkmaar Zaanstreek). In 2006, the club moved to a new 17,000 capacity stadium, the DSB Stadion, now named the [[AFAS Stadion]]. In [[2008–09 Eredivisie|2008–2009]], AZ won the [[Eredivisie]], the Dutch football league. It was the second league title for the club after the Eredivisie in 1980/81 with only one league defeat. Notable coaches include former [[FC Barcelona]] coach [[Ronald Koeman]], and [[Netherlands national football team]] coach [[Louis van Gaal]].
