'''Washington, D.C.''', formally the '''District of Columbia''' and commonly known as '''Washington''' or '''D.C.''', is the [[capital city]] and [[Federal district of the United States|federal district]] of the [[United States]]. The city is on the [[Potomac River]], across from [[Virginia]], and shares land borders with [[Maryland]] to its north and east. It was named after [[George Washington]], the first [[president of the United States]]. The district is named after [[Columbia (personification)|Columbia]], the female [[National personification|personification of the nation]].

The [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]] in 1789 called for the creation of a [[federal district]] under the [[District of Columbia home rule|exclusive jurisdiction]] of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]]. As such, Washington, D.C., is not part of any [[U.S. state|state]], and is not one itself. The [[Residence Act]], adopted on July 16, 1790, approved the creation of the [[Capital districts and territories|capital district]] along the Potomac River. The city was founded in 1791, and the [[6th United States Congress|6th Congress]] held the first session in the unfinished [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]] in 1800 after the capital moved from [[Philadelphia]]. In 1801, the District of Columbia, formerly part of Maryland and Virginia and including the existing settlements of [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] and [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], was officially recognized as the federal district; initially, the city was a separate settlement within the larger district. In 1846, Congress [[District of Columbia retrocession|returned the land originally ceded by Virginia]], including the city of Alexandria. In 1871, it created a [[District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871|single municipality]] for the remaining portion of the district. There have been several unsuccessful [[District of Columbia statehood movement|efforts to make the district into a state]] since the 1880s; a [[Washington, D.C., Admission Act|statehood bill]] passed the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 2021 but was not adopted by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]].

[[L'Enfant Plan|Designed in 1791]] by [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]], the city is divided into [[Quadrants of Washington, D.C.|quadrants]], which are centered around the Capitol Building and include 131 [[Neighborhoods in Washington, D.C.|neighborhoods]]. As of the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], the city had a population of 689,545.<ref name="QuickFacts" /> Commuters from the city's Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city's daytime population to more than one&nbsp;million during the workweek.<ref name="U.S. Department of Commerce">{{cite web |title=Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/migration/metxmet/a47900.html |website=U.S. Census Bureau |publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce |access-date=April 12, 2017 |archive-date=April 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419231809/http://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/migration/metxmet/a47900.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[Washington metropolitan area]], which includes parts of Maryland, Virginia, and [[West Virginia]], is the country's [[Metropolitan statistical area|seventh-largest metropolitan area]], with a 2023 population of 6.3&nbsp;million residents.<ref name="MetroEst" /> [[Mayor of the District of Columbia|A locally elected mayor]] and [[Council of the District of Columbia|13-member council]] have governed the district since 1973, though Congress retains the power to overturn local laws. Washington, D.C., residents are, on the federal level, [[disenfranchisement|politically disenfranchised]] since the city's residents do not have voting representation in Congress; the city's residents elect a single [[Non-voting members of the United States House of Representatives|non-voting congressional delegate]] to the U.S. House of Representatives. The city's voters choose three [[United States Electoral College|presidential electors]] in accordance with the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-third Amendment]].

Washington, D.C. anchors the southern end of the [[Northeast megalopolis]].

Various tribes of the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]]-speaking [[Piscataway people]], also known as the Conoy, inhabited the lands around the [[Potomac River]] and present-day Washington, D.C., when Europeans first arrived and colonized the region in the early 17th century. The [[Nacotchtank]], also called the Nacostines by [[Catholic missions|Catholic missionaries]], maintained settlements around the [[Anacostia River]] in present-day Washington, D.C. Conflicts with [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]] and neighboring tribes ultimately displaced the Piscataway people, some of whom established a new settlement in 1699 near [[Point of Rocks, Maryland]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BaJrnQEACAAJ |title=Ancient Washington: American Indian Cultures of the Potomac Valley |last1=Humphrey |first1=Robert Lee |last2=Chambers |first2=Mary Elizabeth |date=1977 |publisher=George Washington University |isbn=978-1-888028-04-1 |access-date=March 6, 2018 |archive-date=January 26, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210126020432/https://books.google.com/books?id=BaJrnQEACAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:USA-Georgetown C&O Canal.jpg|right|thumb|The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal was extended to Georgetown in 1830.]]
Washington, D.C., was a [[planned city]], and many of the city's [[street grid]]s were developed in that initial plan. In 1791, President [[George Washington]] commissioned [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]], a French-born military engineer and artist, to design the new capital. He enlisted the help of Isaac Roberdeau, [[Étienne Sulpice Hallet]] and Scottish surveyor [[Alexander Ralston]] to help lay out the city plan.<ref name="c109">{{cite book |last=Coleman |first=Christopher Bush |title=Indiana Magazine of History |publisher=Indiana Historical Society |year=1920 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZY1AAAAIAAJ |page=109 |access-date=December 13, 2020 |archive-date=March 27, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210327185145/https://books.google.com/books?id=wZY1AAAAIAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[L'Enfant Plan]] featured broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles, providing room for open space and landscaping.<ref name=lenfant>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/wash/lenfant.htm |title=The L'Enfant and McMillan Plans |access-date=May 27, 2008 |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |archive-date=August 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827160250/http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/wash/lenfant.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> 

L'Enfant was also provided a roll of maps by [[Thomas Jefferson]] depicting Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Strasbourg, Paris, Orleans, Bordeaux, Lyon, Marseille, Turin, and Milan.<ref>Berg, Scott. "Grand Avenues." Pantheon Books, 2007. Page 87</ref> L'Enfant's design also envisioned a garden-lined grand avenue about {{convert|1|mi|km}} long and {{convert|400|ft|m}} wide in an area that is now the [[National Mall]] inspired by the grounds at [[Versailles]] and [[Tuileries]] Gardens.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/62wash/62locate1.htm |title=Map 1: The L'Enfant Plan for Washington |publisher=National Park Service |access-date=October 27, 2009 |archive-date=October 20, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020135549/http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/62wash/62locate1.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> In March 1792, President Washington dismissed L'Enfant due to conflicts with the three commissioners appointed to supervise the capital's construction. [[Andrew Ellicott]], who worked with L'Enfant in surveying the city, was then tasked with completing its design. Though Ellicott revised the original L'Enfant plans, including changing some street patterns, L'Enfant is still credited with the city's overall design.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Crew |first1=Harvey W. |last2=Webb |first2=William Bensing |last3=Wooldridge |first3=John |title=Centennial History of the City of Washington, D.C. |publisher=United Brethren Publishing House |year=1892 |location=Dayton, OH |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_5Q81AAAAIAAJ |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_5Q81AAAAIAAJ/page/n108 101]–103}}</ref>

By the early 20th century, however, L'Enfant's vision of a grand national capital was marred by slums and randomly placed buildings in the city, including a railroad station on the National Mall. Congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying Washington's ceremonial core.<ref name=ramroth /> What became known as the [[McMillan Plan]] was finalized in 1901 and included relandscaping the Capitol grounds and the National Mall, clearing slums, and establishing a new citywide park system. The plan is thought to have largely preserved L'Enfant's intended design for the city.<ref name=lenfant />

=== Budgetary issues ===
[[File:Muriel Bowser official photo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Muriel Bowser]], D.C.'s mayor, took office in 2015.]]
The mayor and council set local taxes and a budget, which Congress must approve. The [[Government Accountability Office]] and other analysts have estimated that the city's high percentage of tax-exempt property and the Congressional prohibition of commuter taxes create a structural deficit in the district's local budget of anywhere between $470&nbsp;million and over $1&nbsp;billion per year. Congress typically provides additional grants for federal programs such as [[Medicaid]] and the operation of the [[National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997|local justice system]]; however, analysts claim that the payments do not fully resolve the imbalance.<ref name=DCAppleseed>{{cite web |title=Building the Best Capital City in the World |url=http://www.dcappleseed.org/library/DC%20Appleseed%20Report.FINAL.pdf |publisher=DC Appleseed |access-date=February 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511193725/http://www.dcappleseed.org/library/DC%20Appleseed%20Report.FINAL.pdf |archive-date=May 11, 2011}}</ref><ref name=GAO>{{cite web |title=District of Columbia Structural Imbalance and Management Issues |url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03666.pdf |publisher=Government Accountability Office |date=May 2003 |access-date=February 5, 2011 |archive-date=February 2, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202235328/http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03666.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

Opponents to federal voting rights for Washington, D.C., propose that the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] never intended for district residents to have a vote in Congress since the Constitution makes clear that representation must come from the states.
