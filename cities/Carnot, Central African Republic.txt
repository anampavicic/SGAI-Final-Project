'''Carnot''' is a city located in the south west of the [[Central African Republic]] (CAR), in the [[Prefectures of the Central African Republic|prefecture]] of [[Mambéré]].

It has a population of 54,551 (2012 census), making it the fourth largest city in CAR by population.

The city takes its name as a tribute to the [[Assassination of Sadi Carnot|assassinated]] [[President of France|French President]] [[Sadi Carnot (statesman)|Sadi Carnot]].

The city is situated on the eastern bank of the [[Mambéré river]], and is served by [[Carnot Airport]].

Yams, cassava, and cotton are cultivated, and cattle are reared in the area. The region lacks a functioning health service and is affected by an extremely high mortality rate and a high disease burden of [[malaria]], [[HIV]] and [[tuberculosis]].

== History ==
In 1894, [[François Joseph Clozel]] founded a French military post near the village of Tendira. The locality was given the name ''Carnot'' in homage to the French president assassinated in 1894: Sadi Carnot (1837-1894).

In 1902, the town became home to the <abbr>5th</abbr> company of the <abbr>1st</abbr> RTS ([[Senegalese Tirailleurs|Senegalese Rifle Regiment]]), a corps of colonial infantry in the French army.

On 4 November 1911, as part of the Franco-German Accord, an agreement that ended the [[Agadir Crisis]], Carnot was ceded to the [[Kamerun|German Cameroon (Kamerun)]]. While claimed by Germany, the region became known as [[Neukamerun]].

During the First World War, the [[Kamerun campaign]] (1914), saw the departure of the German occupiers. As a result of this, France then re-claimed the region. By decree on 12 December 1920, Carnot became the capital of a subdivision of the district of [[Haute-Sangha]], then the capital of the district of Mambéré-Lobaye, in [[French Congo|French Congo (Colonie du Moyen-Congo)]]. The city was involved in the [[Natural rubber|rubber]] trade. From the middle of the 1920s onward, cars and roads were introduced to the area. A ferry across the Mambéré was commissioned in 1926. The region was struck by an earthquake in 1934. The following year a Protestant mission was built in Carnot.

French soldiers departed from the city in 1937. In 1938, [[Berbers]] and [[Fula people|Fulani]] peoples arrived from North Africa and settled in the area. The first mosque was built in Carnot in 1940, and a bridge over the river Mambéré was constructed in 1944.

The city is the seat of the Roman Catholic parish of Notre-Dame de la Mambéré de Carnot founded in 1945; it depends on the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Berbérati|diocese of Berbérati]].

The collapse of the mining industry in 2009, and resulting impoverishment of much of the population in Carnot, exacerbated the already poor health situation resulting in high levels of [[malnutrition]] and mortality.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=Nov 2011|title=Central African Republic: A State of Silent Crisis|url=https://www.msf.org.uk/sites/uk/files/A_State_of_Silent_Crisis_EN_201112131500.pdf|access-date=|website=Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)}}</ref>

=== Civil war ===
On 1 February 2014 Seleka withdrew from Carnot leaving city under [[Anti-balaka]] control. Local Muslims were subject to threats and attacks. More than 18 people were killed until 8 February.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msfindia.in/car-extreme-violence-and-tensions-carnot/|title=CAR: Extreme Violence and Tensions in Carnot|date=13 February 2014}}</ref> In July 2017 it was reported to be under control of security forces.<ref>[https://www.ipisresearch.be/mapping/webmapping/car/v2/#4.939947586660097/15.860309600830078/9.669308482518394/4/2/ IPIS Survey]</ref> On 27 December 2020 rebels from [[Coalition of Patriots for Change]] took control of Carnot. They withdrew from the town on 30 December after looting public buildings and burning voting cards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://corbeaunews-centrafrique.com/rca-les-rebelles-du-cpc-quittent-la-ville-de-carnot/|title=RCA : les rebelles du CPC quittent la ville de Carnot|date=31 December 2020}}</ref>

In December 2020, Carnot became the capital [[Mambéré]] Prefecture.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Oubangui Médias |first1=Oubangui Médias |title=La Centrafrique dispose désormais de 20 préfectures et de 84 sous-préfectures |url=https://oubanguimedias.com/2020/12/11/la-centrafrique-dispose-desormais-de-20-prefectures-et-de-84-sous-prefectures/ |website=oubanguimedias.com |publisher=Oubangi Medias |access-date=10 March 2023}}</ref>
