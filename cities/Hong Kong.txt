Hong Kong was established as a [[British Hong Kong|colony of the British Empire]] after the [[Qing dynasty]] ceded [[Hong Kong Island]] in 1841–1842 as a consequence of losing the [[First Opium War]]. The colony expanded to the [[Kowloon Peninsula]] in 1860 and was further extended when the United Kingdom obtained a [[99-year lease]] of the [[New Territories]] in 1898. Hong Kong was [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong|occupied]] by [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] from [[Battle of Hong Kong|1941]] to [[Liberation Day (Hong Kong)|1945]] during [[World War II]].

<!-- [[Name of Hong Kong]] redirects here -->

The name of the territory, first [[Romanization|romanised]] as "He-Ong-Kong" in 1780,<ref>{{harvnb|Empson|1992|p=94}}.</ref> originally referred to a small inlet located between [[Ap Lei Chau|Aberdeen Island]] and the southern coast of Hong Kong Island. [[Aberdeen, Hong Kong|Aberdeen]] was an initial point of contact between British sailors and local fishermen.<ref>{{harvnb|Bishop|Roberts|1997|p=218}}.</ref> Although the source of the romanised name is unknown, it is generally believed to be an early phonetic rendering of the [[Cantonese]] (or [[Tanka people#Dialect|Tanka Cantonese]]) phrase ''hēung góng''. The name translates as "fragrant harbour" or "incense harbour".<ref name="HerbariumName" /><ref name="CarrollHKName" /><ref name="etym">{{harvnb|Room|2005|p=168}}.</ref> "Fragrant" may refer to the sweet taste of the harbour's freshwater influx from the Pearl River or to the odour from incense factories lining the coast of northern [[Kowloon]]. The incense was stored near Aberdeen Harbour for export before [[Victoria Harbour]] was developed.<ref name="etym" /> [[John Francis Davis|Sir John Davis]] (the second colonial governor) offered an alternative origin; Davis said that the name derived from "Hoong-keang" ("red torrent"), reflecting the colour of soil over which a waterfall on the island flowed.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1841|p=6}}.</ref>

The simplified name ''Hong Kong'' was frequently used by 1810.<ref>{{harvnb|Empson|1992|p=96}}.</ref> The name was also commonly written as the single word ''Hongkong'' until 1926, when the government officially adopted the two-word name.<ref>{{harvnb|Hong Kong Government Gazette|1926}}, No. 479.</ref> Some corporations founded during the early colonial era still keep this name, including [[Hongkong Land]], [[Hongkong Electric Company]], [[Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels]] and [[the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation]] (HSBC).<ref>{{harvnb|HSH Annual Report|2017|p=6}}.</ref><ref name="HSBC">{{harvnb|HSBC Annual Report|2011|p=2}}.</ref>

{{For timeline|Timeline of Hong Kong history}}

=== Prehistory and Imperial China ===
Earliest known human traces in what is now Hong Kong are dated by some to 35,000 and 39,000 years ago during the [[Paleolithic]] period. The claim is based on an archaeological investigation in [[Wong Tei Tung]], [[Sai Kung Peninsula|Sai Kung]] in 2003. The archaeological works revealed [[Knapping|knapped]] [[stone tool]]s from deposits that were dated using optical [[luminescence dating]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Vin|last2=Ixer|first2=Rob|date=2009|title=The Petrology of the Wong Tei Tung Stone Tool Manufacturing Site, Sham Chung, Hong Kong Sar, China|url=http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue26/davisixer_index.html|journal=Internet Archaeology|issue=26|doi=10.11141/ia.26.8|access-date=8 June 2020|archive-date=26 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326063250/https://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue26/davisixer_index.html|url-status=live| issn = 1363-5387}}</ref>

During the [[Neolithic|Middle Neolithic]] period, about 6,000 years ago, the region had been widely occupied by humans.<ref name="Meacham2">{{harvnb|Meacham|1999|p=2}}.</ref> Neolithic to [[Bronze Age]] Hong Kong settlers were semi-coastal people.

Administrative infrastructure was quickly built by early 1842, but piracy, disease, and hostile Qing policies initially prevented the government from attracting commerce.

=== Climate ===
Hong Kong has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cwa''), characteristic of southern China, despite being located south of the [[Tropic of Cancer]], although closely bordering on a [[tropical climate]]. Summers are long, hot and humid, with occasional showers and thunderstorms and warm air from the southwest. The humid nature of Hong Kong exacerbates the warmth of summer. [[Typhoon]]s occur most often then, sometimes resulting in floods or landslides.

Hong Kong developed into a filmmaking hub during the late 1940s as a wave of Shanghai filmmakers migrated to the territory, and these movie veterans helped build the colony's entertainment industry over the next decade.<ref>{{harvnb|Fu|2008|pp=381, 388–389}}.</ref> By the 1960s, the city was well known to overseas audiences through films such as ''[[The World of Suzie Wong (film)|The World of Suzie Wong]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2007|p=148}}.</ref> When [[Bruce Lee]]'s ''[[The Way of the Dragon]]'' was released in 1972, local productions became popular outside Hong Kong. During the 1980s, films such as ''[[A Better Tomorrow]]'', ''[[As Tears Go By (film)|As Tears Go By]]'', and ''[[Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain]]'' expanded global interest beyond [[martial arts film]]s; locally made gangster films, romantic dramas, and supernatural fantasies became popular.<ref>{{harvnb|Carroll|2007|p=168}}.</ref>

Hong Kong cinema continued to be internationally successful over the following decade with critically acclaimed dramas such as ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'', ''[[To Live (1994 film)|To Live]]'', and ''[[Chungking Express]]''. The city's martial arts film roots are evident in the roles of the most prolific Hong Kong actors. [[Jackie Chan]], [[Donnie Yen]], [[Jet Li]], [[Chow Yun-fat]], and [[Michelle Yeoh]] frequently play action-oriented roles in foreign films. Hong Kong films have also grown popular in oversea markets such as Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia, earning the city the moniker "Hollywood of the East".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Chu |first=Karen |date=16 February 2023 |title=Berlin Spotlight: How Hong Kong's Film Industry Made a Surprise Comeback |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/hong-kong-film-industry-comeback-berlin-1235326295/ |access-date=22 February 2023 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en-US}}</ref> At the height of the local movie industry in the early 1990s, over 400 films were produced each year; since then, industry momentum shifted to mainland China.

[[Cantopop]] is a genre of Cantonese popular music which emerged in Hong Kong during the 1970s. Evolving from Shanghai-style ''[[shidaiqu]]'', it is also influenced by [[Cantonese opera]] and Western pop.<ref>{{harvnb|Chu|2017|pp=1–9, 24–25}}.</ref> Local media featured songs by artists such as [[Sam Hui]], [[Anita Mui]], [[Leslie Cheung]], and [[Alan Tam]]; during the 1980s, exported films and shows exposed Cantopop to a global audience.<ref>{{harvnb|Chu|2017|pp=77–85}}.</ref> The genre's popularity peaked in the 1990s, when the [[Four Heavenly Kings (Hong Kong)|Four Heavenly Kings]] dominated Asian record charts.<ref>{{harvnb|Chu|2017|pp=107–116}}.</ref> Despite a general decline since late in the decade,<ref>{{harvnb|Chu|2017|pp=9–10}}.</ref> Cantopop remains dominant in Hong Kong; contemporary artists such as [[Eason Chan]], [[Joey Yung]], and [[Twins (group)|Twins]] are popular in and beyond the territory.<ref>{{harvnb|Chu|2017|pp=159–164}}.</ref>

Western classical music has historically had a strong presence in Hong Kong and remains a large part of local musical education.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Moir|Brennan|Rambarran|2017|p=101}}</ref> The publicly funded [[Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra]], the territory's oldest professional symphony orchestra, frequently hosts musicians and conductors from overseas. The [[Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra]], composed of [[Chinese orchestra|classical Chinese instruments]], is the leading Chinese ensemble and plays a significant role in promoting traditional music in the community.<ref>{{harvnb|Ho|2011|p=147}}.</ref>

Hong Kong has never had a separate national anthem to the country that controlled it; its current official national anthem is therefore that of the People's Republic of China, ''[[March of the Volunteers]]''. The song ''[[Glory to Hong Kong]]'' has been used by [[2019–2020 Hong Kong protests|protestors]] as an unofficial anthem of the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/1707883/glory-to-hong-kong-is-citys-new-unofficial-anthem/|title=Singing showdowns in Hong Kong pit the city's unofficial new anthem against China's|author=Vivienne Chow|date=12 September 2019|work=Quartz|access-date=15 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190913230100/https://qz.com/1707883/glory-to-hong-kong-is-citys-new-unofficial-anthem/|archive-date=13 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |title=Listen to the Song That Hong Kong's Youthful Protesters Are Calling Their 'National Anthem' |url=https://time.com/5672018/glory-to-hong-kong-protests-national-anthem/ |accessdate=16 November 2022 |magazine=TIME |date=12 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220124103722/https://time.com/5672018/glory-to-hong-kong-protests-national-anthem/ |archive-date=24 January 2022}}</ref>

The city has hosted numerous major sporting events, including the [[2009 East Asian Games]], the [[Equestrian at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics equestrian events]], and the [[2007 Premier League Asia Trophy]].<ref name="ShenKee">{{harvnb|Shen|Kee|2017|p=247}}.</ref> The territory regularly hosts the [[Hong Kong Sevens]], [[Hong Kong Marathon]], [[Hong Kong Tennis Classic]] and [[Lunar New Year Cup]], and hosted the inaugural [[AFC Asian Cup]] and the [[1995 Dynasty Cup]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ghoshal|2011}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Horne|Manzenreiter|2002|p=128}}.</ref>

Hong Kong represents itself separately from mainland China, with its own sports teams in international competitions.<ref name="ShenKee"/> The territory has participated in almost every Summer Olympics since 1952 and has earned [[Hong Kong at the Olympics|nine medals]]. [[Lee Lai-shan]] won the territory's first Olympic gold medal at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Atlanta Olympics]],<ref>{{harvnb|Lam|Chang|2005|p=141}}.</ref> and [[Cheung Ka Long]] won the second one in [[2020 Summer Olympics|Tokyo 2020]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Shum |first1=Michael |last2=Chow |first2=Carine |title=FENCE-TASTIC!

[[Dragon boat]] races originated as a religious ceremony conducted during the annual [[Dragon Boat Festival|Tuen Ng Festival]]. The race was revived as a modern sport as part of the [[Hong Kong Tourism Board|Tourism Board]]'s efforts to promote Hong Kong's image abroad. The first modern competition was organised in 1976, and overseas teams began competing in the first international race in 1993.<ref>{{harvnb|Sofield|Sivan|2003}}.</ref>

Of residents aged 15 and older, 81% completed lower-secondary education, 66% graduated from an upper secondary school, 32% attended a non-degree tertiary program, and 24% earned a bachelor's degree or higher.<ref>{{harvnb|Women and Men in Hong Kong Key Statistics|2017|p=66}}</ref>

Comprehensive schools fall under three categories: public schools, which are government-run; subsidised schools, including government aid-and-grant schools; and private schools, often those run by religious organisations and that base admissions on academic merit. These schools are subject to the curriculum guidelines as provided by the Education Bureau. Private schools subsidised under the [[Direct Subsidy Scheme]] and international schools fall outside of this system and may elect to use differing curricula and teach using other languages.<ref name="HKEduLi"/>

=== Medium of instruction ===
At primary and secondary school levels, the government maintains a policy of "mother tongue instruction"; most schools use Cantonese as the [[medium of instruction]], with written education in both Chinese and English. Other languages being used as medium of instruction in non-international school education include English and [[Standard Chinese|Putonghua]] (Standard Mandarin Chinese). Secondary schools emphasise "bi-literacy and tri-lingualism", which has encouraged the proliferation of spoken Mandarin language education.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|Leung|2012}}.</ref>

English is the official medium of instruction and assessments for most university programmes in Hong Kong, although use of Cantonese is predominant in informal discussions among local students and professors.<ref>{{Cite web |date=5 April 2010 |title=Teaching and Learning {{!}} HKU Teaching and Learning |url=https://tl.hku.hk/tl/ |access-date=17 May 2023 |website=HKU Teaching and Learning {{!}} Teaching and Learning in The University of Hong Kong}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Proof of English as Medium of Instruction {{!}} HKUST – Academic Registry |url=https://registry.hkust.edu.hk/resource-library/proof-english-medium-instruction |access-date=17 May 2023 |website=registry.hkust.edu.hk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=University Language Policy {{!}} HKBU AR |url=https://ar.hkbu.edu.hk/quality-assurance/university-policy-and-guidelines/lang-policy |access-date=17 May 2023 |website=ar.hkbu.edu.hk |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Languages of instruction |url=https://www.hkmu.edu.hk/admissions/taught-postgraduate/non-local/postgraduate-programmes-at-hkmu/languages-of-instruction/ |access-date=17 May 2023 |website=Hong Kong Metropolitan University |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Study@PolyU |url=https://www51.polyu.edu.hk/eprospectus/ug/international/programme-features |access-date=17 May 2023 |website=www51.polyu.edu.hk |archive-date=17 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230517015558/https://www51.polyu.edu.hk/eprospectus/ug/international/programme-features |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Res – Frequently Asked Questions on Applications for Transcript/Letter of Certification/Report on Curriculum Details |url=http://www.res.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/applications/graduates-of-full-time-undergraduate-programmes/transcript-certifying-letter-report-on-curriculum-details/faq-transcript-certifyingletter-curriculum-details |access-date=17 May 2023 |website=www.res.cuhk.edu.hk}}</ref>
