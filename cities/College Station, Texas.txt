College Station is home to the main campus of [[Texas A&M University]], the flagship institution of the [[Texas A&M University System]]. The city owes its name and existence to the university's location along a railroad. Texas A&M's triple designation as a [[land-grant university]], [[National Sea Grant College Program]], and [[National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program]] reflects the broad scope of the research endeavors it brings to the city, with ongoing projects funded by agencies such as [[NASA]], the [[National Institutes of Health]], the [[National Science Foundation]], and the [[Office of Naval Research]].

College Station's origins date from 1860, when the [[Houston and Texas Central Railway]] began to build through the region.<ref name=TSHA>{{cite web| title=College Station, Texas| first=Mark| last=Odintz| publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]]| url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdc02| access-date=June 15, 2008}}</ref> Eleven years later, the site was chosen as the location for the proposed Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, a land-grant school.<ref name="TSHA" /> In 1876, as the nation celebrated its [[centennial]], the school (renamed [[Texas A&M University]] in 1963) opened its doors as the first public institution of higher education in the state of Texas.<ref name="TSHA" />

College Station's population grew slowly, reaching 350 in 1884 and 391 at the turn of the century.<ref name="TSHA" /> However, during this time, transportation improvements took place in the town. In 1900, the [[International–Great Northern Railroad|I&GN]] Railroad was extended to College Station<ref>{{cite web| title=A Guide to Historic Brazos County| publisher=Brazos Heritage Society| year=2003| page=25| url=http://www.brazosheritage.org/pdfs/historicbrazosbrochure.pdf| access-date= June 15, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080626162050/http://www.brazosheritage.org/pdfs/historicbrazosbrochure.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = June 26, 2008}}</ref> (the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]] Company abandoned the line in 1965),<ref>{{cite web| title= International-Great Northern Railroad| first=George C.| last=Werner| publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]]| url= https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/eqi04| access-date=June 15, 2008}}</ref> and 10 years later, electric [[interurban]] service was established between Texas A&M and the neighboring town of Bryan.<ref name="TSHA" /> A city bus system replaced the interurban in the 1920s.<ref name="TSHA" />

In 1930, the community to the north of College Station, known as North Oakwood, was incorporated as part of Bryan.<ref name="TSHA" /> College Station did not incorporate until October 19, 1938, after a 217-39 vote,<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Jessica|url= https://blog.cstx.gov/2023/10/02/how-you-can-help-make-college-stations-85th-birthday-bash-on-oct-18-a-night-to-remember/|title=How you can help make College Station's 85th birthday bash on Oct. 18 a night to remember|date=October 2, 2023|website=City of College Station|access-date=October 19, 2023}}</ref> with John H.

The city grew under the leadership of Ernest Langford, called by some the "Father of College Station", who began a 26-year stretch as mayor in 1942. Early in his first term, the city adopted a council-manager system of city government.<ref name="TSHA" />

Population growth accelerated following [[World War II]] as the nonstudent population reached 7,898 in 1950, 11,396 in 1960, 17,676 in 1970, 30,449 in 1980, 52,456 in 1990, and 67,890 in 2000.<ref name="TSHA" /> The Bryan-College Station metropolitan area's population crossed 270,000 people in 2018.

In the 1990s, College Station and Texas A&M University drew national attention when the [[George Bush Presidential Library]] opened in 1997. Attention was drawn again in 1999, when 12 people were killed and 27 injured when the [[Aggie Bonfire]] [[1999 Aggie Bonfire collapse|collapsed while being constructed]].

In 2022, it became one of the first areas served by [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]]'s [[Amazon Prime Air|Prime Air]] drone delivery service, along with [[Lockeford, California]].

==Districts==
===Northgate===
Northgate is a mixed-use district north of Texas A&M University that features a combination of businesses, restaurants, apartments, churches, and entertainment. It is known for its eclectic mix of [[restaurant]]s and [[Bar (establishment)|bars]].<ref>{{cite news |title=College Station, Tex. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 22, 2006 |first=Finn-Olaf |last=Jones |page=1F}}</ref><ref name="City of College Station">{{cite web | title=Retail and Entertainment District: Northgate | publisher=City of College Station | url=http://www.cstx.gov/home/index.asp?page=164 | access-date=June 16, 2008 }}</ref> A large portion of the stores, bars, and restaurants in Northgate are frequented, patronized, and staffed by Texas A&M students.<ref name="City of College Station"/> In total, the district spans about {{convert|145|acre|km2}}, bounded by Wellborn Road to the west, South College Avenue to the east, the College Station city limits to the north, and University Drive to the south. The district is the home of the [[Dixie Chicken (bar)|Dixie Chicken]].

Northgate's roots started in the 1930s as the city began enjoying rapid population growth from the influx of Texas A&M University students, professors, and their families. Realizing that proximity to the campus would be a boon for revenues, the first business district was established in College Station near the campus, taking its name for the closest on-campus landmark: the north gate. When the city was incorporated in 1938, its first City Hall was opened in the new district. In 1994, restoration efforts began to revitalize the ailing area. A four-day music festival, "North By Northgate", was introduced in 1998 and has become an annual tradition, renamed the "Northgate Music Festival" in 2002. In 2006, the city council incorporated Northgate as a special tax zone to finance additional improvements and expansions.<ref>{{cite news |title=College Station creates Northgate tax zone |newspaper=The Bryan-College Station Eagle |date=June 23, 2006|last=Avison |first=April |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-147396685.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026054110/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-147396685.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 26, 2012}}</ref>

Live music is a major draw to the Northgate area. Many well-known musicians, especially in the [[Texas country music]] scene, initially performed in the Northgate area. Notable names include [[Robert Earl Keen]], Grammy award-winner [[Lyle Lovett]], Dub Miller, and [[Roger Creager]]. The district is bisected to the north by Church Street, made famous by the Robert Earl Keen and Lyle Lovett duet "The Front Porch Song".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Clark |first=Rob |date=14 February 2013 |title=Lyle Lovett and Robert Earl Keen recall the legendary 'Front Porch' at Texas A&M |url=https://myaggienation.com/aggie_profiles/lyle-lovett-and-robert-earl-keen-recall-the-legendary-front-porch-at-texas-a-m/article_771efed0-3921-11e4-95db-001a4bcf887a.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20230105050738/https://myaggienation.com/aggie_profiles/lyle-lovett-and-robert-earl-keen-recall-the-legendary-front-porch-at-texas-a-m/article_771efed0-3921-11e4-95db-001a4bcf887a.html |archive-date=5 January 2023 |access-date=4 January 2023 |website=myaggienation.com}}</ref>

===Wellborn District===
[[Wellborn, Texas|Wellborn]] became a community in 1867 as a construction camp on the Houston and Texas Central Railroad. The town's name has been attributed to a well at the construction camp, a foreman named E.W. Wellborn, or a landowner named W.W. Willburn. Also in 1867, a post office opened in the community under the name Wellborn Station. In 1870, the name was shortened to Wellborn.<ref>"Wellborn, Texas". The Handbook of Texas online. Retrieved July 3, 2009.</ref> On April 14, 2011, the City Council of College Station voted 5–2 to annex Wellborn, thus making the community the Wellborn district. Wellborn is often mispronounced as 'well-born' but is pronounced by locals as 'Well-burn'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kbtx.com/home/headlines/CS_City_Council_Votes_to_Annex_Wellborn_119890359.html|title=CS City Council Votes to Annex Wellborn|first=Cody Lillich and Clay|last=Falls|access-date=April 19, 2012|archive-date=March 14, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314020047/http://www.kbtx.com/home/headlines/CS_City_Council_Votes_to_Annex_Wellborn_119890359.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>
