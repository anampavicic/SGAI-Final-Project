Daegu is the third-largest [[urban agglomeration]] in South Korea after [[Seoul]] and [[Busan]]; it is the fourth-largest [[List of provincial-level cities of South Korea|metropolitan city]] in the nation with over 2.3&nbsp;million residents;<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-12-31 |title=Daegu Metropolitan Area Population Info |url=http://daegu.go.kr/ |access-date=2024-06-04 |website=daegu.go.kr |language=ko}}</ref> and the second-largest city after Busan in the [[Yeongnam]] [[Regions of Korea|region]] in southeastern South Korea.  Daegu and the surrounding [[North Gyeongsang Province]] are often referred to as [[Daegu-Gyeongbuk]], with a total population of over 5 million.

Daegu is located in south-eastern Korea about {{cvt|80|km|0}} from the coast, near the [[Geumho River]] and its mainstream, [[Nakdong River]] in [[Gyeongsang Province]]. The Daegu basin is the central plain of the [[Yeongnam]] [[List of regions of Korea|region]]. In ancient times, the Daegu area was part of the proto-kingdom [[Jinhan]]. Subsequently, Daegu came under the control of the [[Silla Kingdom]], which unified the [[Korean Peninsula]]. During the [[Joseon]] period, the city was the capital of [[Gyeongsang Province]], one of the traditional [[Eight Provinces of Korea|eight provinces]] of the country.

Daegu was an economic motor of Korea during the 1960s–1980s period and was especially known for its electronics industry. The humid subtropical climate of Daegu is ideal for producing high-quality apples, thus the nickname, "Apple City".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eslstarter.com/south-korea-province-guide-daegu.php |title=Teaching jobs in South Korea |website=Eslstarter.com |access-date=2012-07-21 |archive-date=2012-06-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610210826/http://www.eslstarter.com/south-korea-province-guide-daegu.php |url-status=live }}</ref> Daegu is also known as "Textile City".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abcarticledirectory.com/Article/Daegu---The-City-of-Textile-Industry/1669374 |title=Daegu - The City of Textile Industry |access-date=2012-07-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726220423/http://www.abcarticledirectory.com/Article/Daegu---The-City-of-Textile-Industry/1669374 |archive-date=2012-07-26 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Textiles used to be the pillar industry of the city.

==History==
{{Main|History of Daegu}}

===Prehistory and early history===
Archaeological investigations in the Greater Daegu area have revealed a large number of settlements and burials of the prehistoric [[Mumun pottery period]] (around 1500–300 BC). In fact, some of the earliest evidence of Mumun settlement in Gyeongsangdo have been excavated from Siji-dong and Seobyeon-dong.<ref name="ReferenceA">YUM (Yeungnam University Museum). ''Siji-eui Munhwayujeok VIII: Chwirakji Bonmun'' [Cultural Sites of Siji VIII: Settlement Site Text]. Research Report No. 33. Yeungnam University Museum, Gyeongsan, 1999b</ref> Dongcheon-dong is one of the substantial Mumun agricultural villages that have been excavated.<ref>YICP (Yongnam Institute of Cultural Properties). ''Daegu Dongcheon-dong Chwirak Yujeok'' [The Settlement Site at Dongcheon-dong, Daegu]. 3 vols. Research Report of Antiquities, Vol. 43. YICP, Daegu, 2002. {{ISBN|978-89-88226-41-4}}</ref> The Dongcheon-dong site dates back to the Middle Mumun (around 850–550 BC) and contains the remains of many prehistoric pit-houses and agricultural fields. Megalithic burials (dolmens) have also been found in large numbers in Daegu.

Ancient historical texts indicate that during the [[Proto–Three Kingdoms]] ([[Mahan confederacy|Mahan]], [[Jinhan]], and [[Byeonhan]]) period, Daegu was the site of a chiefdom or walled-town polity known from that time, according to historical records, as [[Dalgubeol]]. It was absorbed into the kingdom of [[Silla]] no later than the fifth century. The vestiges of the wall can be seen, and relics have been excavated in the current [[Dalseong Park]].

===Silla===
{{See also|Three Kingdom Period}}
[[File:칠곡송림사오층전탑사리장치.jpg|thumb|Reliquary from eighth-century Silla, [[Daegu National Museum]]]]
Silla succeeded in unifying the Korean peninsula by defeating the other kingdoms of [[Baekje]] and [[Goguryeo]] in the late seventh century, partly due to assistance from China's [[Tang dynasty]]. Shortly thereafter, in 689, Silla's King [[Sinmun of Silla|Sinmun]] considered moving the capital from [[Gyeongju]] to Daegu, but was unable to do so.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 76 and Shin (1999)</ref> This initiative is known only through a single line in the ''[[Samguk sagi]]'', a most valued historical record of ancient Korea by Koryeo dynasty historian [[Gim Busik|Kim Bu-sik]], but it is presumed to indicate both an attempt by the Silla king to reinforce royal authority and the entrenched resistance of the Gyeongju political elites that was the likely cause of the move's failure.<ref>Lee (1984) and Shin (1999) both make this assumption</ref> The city was given its current name in 757.

In the late 1990s, archaeologists excavated a large-scale fortified Silla site in Dongcheon-dong, Buk-gu.<ref>FPCP (Foundation for the Preservation of Cultural Properties). ''Daegu Chilgok Sam Taekji Munhwayejeok Balguljosa Bogoseo'' [Excavation Report of the Cultural Site at Localities 2 and 3, Building Area 3, Chilgok, Daegu]. 3 vols. Antiquities Research Report 62. FPCP, Gyeongju, 2000</ref> The site at Locality 2 consists of the remains of 39 raised-floor buildings enclosed by a formidable ditch-and-palisade system. The excavators hypothesize that the fortified site was a permanent military encampment or barracks. Archaeologists also uncovered a large Silla village dating to the sixth to seventh centuries AD at Siji-dong.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Later Three Kingdoms and Goryeo===
{{See also|Goryeo}}
During the [[Later Three Kingdoms period]], 892–936, Daegu was initially aligned with [[Later Baekje]]. In 927, northern Daegu was the site of the Battle of Gong Mountain between the forces of [[Goryeo]] under [[Wang Kŏn]] and those of Later Baekje under [[Kyŏn Hwŏn]]. In this battle, the forces of Goryeo were crushed and Wang Kŏn himself was saved only by the heroic deed of his general [[Sin Sung-gyŏm]]. However, the atrocities of the Later Baekje forces at this time apparently changed local sympathizers to favor Wang Kŏn, who later became the king of [[Goryeo]].

Numerous place names and local legends in the area still bear witness to the historic battle of 927. Among these are "[[Ansim Station|Ansim]]", which literally means "peace of mind", said to be the first place where Wang Geon dared to stop after escaping the battle, and "[[Banwol-dong, Ansan|Banwol]]", or half-moon, where he is said to have stopped and admired the moon before returning to Goryeo. A statue commemorating the battle now stands in northern Daegu, as does a memorial to Sin Sung-gyŏm.

In the [[Goryeo]] period, the first edition of the ''[[Tripitaka Koreana]]'' was stored in Daegu, at the temple of Buinsa.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 131</ref> However, this edition was destroyed when the temple was sacked in 1254, during the [[Mongol invasions of Korea]].<ref>Lee (1984), p. 149</ref>

===Joseon===
{{See also|Joseon}}
[[File:Daegu dalseongdo.jpg|thumb|Daegu in the 18th century]]
Daegu served as an important transportation center during the [[Joseon]] dynasty, being located in the middle of the [[Great Yeongnam Road]] which ran between Seoul and Busan, at the junction of this arterial road and the roads to Gyeongju and [[Jinju]].

In 1601, Daegu became the administrative capital of the [[Gyeongsang Province]], which is current Daegu, [[Busan]], [[Ulsan]], [[North Gyeongsang Province]], and [[South Gyeongsang Province]]. At about that time, the city began to grow into a major city. The status continued for nearly 300 years, and the city has been transformed as the capital of Gyeongsangbuk-do since Gyeongsang-do was divided into two provinces, Gyeongsangbuk-do (northern Gyeongsang-province) and Gyeongsangnam-do (southern one) in 1896.

Daegu's first regular markets were established during the late Joseon period. The most famous of these is the [[Yangnyeongsi]] herbal medicine market. This became a center of herbal trade in Joseon, and even attracted buyers from neighboring countries. Traders from Japan, who were not permitted to leave the [[Nakdong River]] valley, hired messengers to visit the market on their behalf. [[Seomun Market]], which stood at the city's west gate at that time, was one of the top-three markets in the Joseon period.

===Korean Empire and colonial rule===
{{See also|Korean Empire}}
Japanese imperialism forcibly opened up Korea's markets beginning in the late 19th century. In 1895, Daegu became the site of one of the country's first modern [[post office]]s, as a part of the 'Gab-o' reforms introduced in the aftermath of the [[First Sino-Japanese war]].<ref>Lee (1984), p. 294</ref>

Beginning in the late 1890s, increasing numbers of foreign merchants and workers started to visit Daegu, which emerged as a modern transportation center of the newly constructed [[Gyeongbu Line]] main railroad connecting Seoul and Busan.

In 1905, the old fortress wall was destroyed. As a tribute to the wall, streets that now run where the wall once stood have been named [[Bukseongno]], Namseongno, [[Dongseongno]] and Seoseongno, which translates as "north fortress street", "south fortress street", "east fortress street" and "west fortress street" respectively.

[[Independence movement]]s against imperial aggression flourished in Daegu, beginning as early as 1898, when a branch of the [[Independence Club]] was established in the town.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 302</ref> As the demise of the [[Korean Empire]] approached in 1907, local citizens led by [[Seo Sang-don]] organized the [[National Debt Repayment Movement]]. The movement spread nationwide, collecting many individual donations toward repaying the national debt. Rebellions continued after the 1910 annexation to Japan, notably during the [[March First Movement]] of 1919. At that time, four major demonstrations took place in Daegu, involving an estimated 23,000 citizens.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 343</ref>

===After 1945===
In 1946, the [[Daegu October Incident]] took place, one of the most serious social disorders since the foundation of the Republic of Korea.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 377</ref> On October 1, Korean national police killed three student demonstrators and injured many others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/2000/412/23267 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111154939/http://www.greenleft.org.au/2000/412/23267 |url-status=dead |title=Green Left – Features: HISTORICAL FEATURE: The Korean War – a war of counter-revolution<!-- Bot generated title --> |archive-date=11 November 2007 |access-date=26 June 2022}}</ref> It was also the site of major demonstrations on February 28, 1960, prior to the [[March 1960 South Korean presidential election|presidential election]] of that year.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 384</ref>

Daegu and all of North Gyeongsang province had heavy guerrilla activities in the late 1940s, as thousands of refugees shied away from the fighting in Jeolla province and sought shelters in Daegu.<ref>Cumings (1997), pp. 243–244</ref> In November 1948, a unit in Daegu joined the mutiny which had begun in [[Yeosu]] the previous month.<ref>Nahm (1996), p. 379</ref> As in many other areas during the Korean War, [[Politicide|political killing]]s of dissenters were widespread.

During the [[Korean War]], heavy fighting occurred nearby along the [[Nakdong River]]. Daegu sat inside the [[Pusan Perimeter]], however, so it remained in South Korean hands throughout the war. The fighting that prevented North Korean troops from crossing the Nakdong River has become known as the [[Battle of Taegu]].

In the second half of the 20th century, the city underwent explosive growth, and the population has increased more than tenfold since the end of the Korean War. The city was politically favored during the 18-year-long rule of [[Park Chung Hee]], when it and the surrounding area served as his political base. Daegu champions conservative political ideas and movements today and is a political base for the [[People Power Party (South Korea)|People Power Party]].

In the 1980s, Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do and became a separately administered provincial-level [[Special cities of South Korea|directly governed city]] (''Jikhalsi''), and was redesignated as a [[Special cities of South Korea|metropolitan city]] (''Gwangyeoksi'') in 1995. Today, Daegu is the third-largest [[metropolitan area]] in Korea with respect to both population and commerce.

Since 1990, Daegu has suffered two of South Korea's worst mass casualty disasters: the [[1995 Daegu gas explosions]], which killed 101 people, and the 2003 [[Daegu subway fire]], which killed 192 people.

In February 2020, Daegu was the epicenter of the [[COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Fear grips Daegu, South Korea, amid coronavirus |url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/fear-grips-daegu-south-korea-amid-coronavirus/story?id=69175021 |work=ABC News |date=24 February 2020 |access-date=29 February 2020 |archive-date=29 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200229163633/https://abcnews.go.com/International/fear-grips-daegu-south-korea-amid-coronavirus/story?id=69175021 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In July 2023, the [[Gunwi County]] of [[North Gyeongsang Province]] was integrated into Daegu.

==Politics==
{{See also|Mayor of Daegu}}
[[File:Daegu city hall context.jpg|thumb|right|Daegu City Hall]]
Two local governments are in the city, the Daegu Metropolitan Government in [[Jung District, Daegu|Jung District]] and Gyeongbuk Provincial Government in [[Buk District, Daegu|Buk District]]. The provincial government will be relocated to [[Andong]] in its proper province, Gyeongbuk. As a result, the provincial government office was relocated to Andong in January 2023. The mayor and heads of city's eight districts are directly elected by the citizens every four years. The city council has 29 members which consist of 26 from the same number of electoral districts and three proportional representations. They are also directly elected every four years. Most of them are the members of the [[People Power Party (South Korea)|People Power Party]], the main [[Conservatism|conservative]] political party in South Korea. Daegu is a stronghold for the party and has produced four Presidents of the Republic of Korea thus far: [[Park Chung Hee]], [[Chun Doo-hwan]], [[Roh Tae-woo]] and [[Park Geun-hye]]. [[Park Chung Hee]] and [[Chun Doo-hwan]] were born in other cities but they moved to Daegu and spent childhood in Daegu. As the capital of the Korean conservatives, the city has wielded strong political influence in [[Elections in South Korea|elections]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2022}}

===Topography===
[[File:Countryandcitydaegu.jpg|none|thumb|upright=4.5|View of the city of Daegu, with Jisan-dong and Beommul-dong]]
Daegu sits in a basin surrounded by low mountains: [[Palgongsan]] to the north, [[Biseulsan]] to the south, Waryongsan to the west, and a series of smaller hills in the east. The [[Geumho River]] flows along the northern and eastern edges of the city, emptying in the Nakdong River west of the city.

The majority of Daegu Metropolitan city lies in a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cwa''). In [[Holdridge life zones|Holdridge climate classification]], Daegu has a warm temperate moist forest climate. The mountains that comprise the basin trap hot and humid air. Similarly, in winter, cold air lies in the basin. The area receives little precipitation except during the rainy season of summer and is sunny throughout much of the year.

Daegu is a manufacturing industry city. The major industries are [[textile]]s, [[metal]]s and [[machinery]]. In 2021, Daegu had a regional GDP of $44,144 million. Many companies such as [[Daegu Bank]], [[Korea Delphi]], [[Hwasung corp.]], and [[TaeguTec]] are situated in this city, and [[Samsung]] and [[Kolon Industries|Kolon]] were founded here. Numerous factories are located in the industrial complexes situated in the west and north sides of the city including the Seongseo Industrial Complex, West Daegu Industrial Complex and the Daegu Dyeing Industrial Complex.

The city is the economic and industrial core of the [[Daegu-Gyeongbuk]] region, one of the major industrial areas in Korea. It accounted for as much as 94 percent of Korea's trade surplus in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |language=ko |url-status=dead |url=http://www.yeongnam.co.kr/Pdf/2007/03/17/120101-17032007999.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903020018/http://www.yeongnam.co.kr/Pdf/2007/03/17/120101-17032007999.pdf |archive-date=2009-09-03 |website=The Yeongnam Ilbo |date=2007-03-17 |script-title=ko:대구굛경북, 한국 수출흑자의 主役 }}</ref> The electronics industries in [[Gumi, Gyeongsangbuk-do|Gumi]] and the steel industries in [[Pohang]] provided great services to that surplus. World-leading manufacturing facilities for [[Anycall]] ([[Samsung Mobile]]) and [[POSCO]]'s main factories are located near the city. Daegu and its neighbouring cities were designated for the [[Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone]] by the central government in 2008. It is specialized companies like Winitech software company in knowledge-based service and manufacturing industries.

Historically, Daegu has been the commercial center of the southern part of the [[Korean Peninsula]] with [[Seoul]] in the center and [[Pyongyang]] in the north (currently North Korea), because of its advantageous location. Some of the large, traditional markets like [[Seomun Market]] are still flourishing in the city.

Additionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu's economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.

Also, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu's population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city's fashion industry.

===Fashion industry===
Beginning in the late 1990s, Daegu has been actively making efforts to promote its [[fashion]] industry based on its textile and [[clothing]] manufacturing industries under the 'Daegu: Fashion City'. The city opens many exhibitions related to the fashion and textile industries including the [http://www.daegufashionfair.com/front/ Daegu Fashion Fair] and [http://www.previewin.com/ Preview in Daegu] annually or semi-annually, and invites national institutes. A large new town specializing in the textile-fashion industries is currently under construction in Bongmu-dong, northeastern Daegu. The district, officially named Esiapolis, takes aim at the fashion hub of East Asia. Textile complexes, textile-fashion institutions, an international school, fashion malls as well as residential areas plan to be developed in the district.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2009/11/24/2009112401092.html |script-title=ko:'패션 허브' 꿈꾸는 복합신도시 - 조선닷컴 - 경제 > 부동산 |publisher=[[The Chosun Ilbo]] |date=Nov 25, 2009  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200507163447/http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2009/11/24/2009112401092.html |access-date=2022-07-19 |archive-date=2020-05-07}}</ref>

==Culture and sightseeing==
[[File:Daegu skyline as seen from KNU's Technopark.jpg|thumb|right|Daegu skyline as seen from KNU's Technopark]]
Generally, Daegu is known as a conservative city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it has become one of the major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, [[Buddhism]] has been strong; today there are still many temples. [[Korean Confucianism|Confucianism]] is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city. Neon cross-topped spires of Christian churches can also be seen in the city.

===Sights===
The most well-known sight of the city is the stone Buddha called [[Gatbawi]] on the top of Gwanbong, [[Palgongsan]]. It is famous for its stone [[Gat (hat)|gat]] (Korean traditional hat). People from all over the country visit the place, because they believe that the Buddha will grant one's single desire.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NXYPDQAAQBAJ&q=Gatbawi+daegu&pg=PT394 |title=Insight Guides South Korea |date=October 2016 |isbn=9781786716644 |last1=Guides |first1=Insight |publisher=Apa Publications (UK) Limited |access-date=2020-10-02 |archive-date=2022-04-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220408151334/https://books.google.com/books?id=NXYPDQAAQBAJ&q=Gatbawi+daegu&pg=PT394 |url-status=live }}</ref> Administratively, the site itself is located in the neighboring city, [[Gyeongsan]], [[North Gyeongsang Province]].

[[File:Donghwasa Temple.jpg|thumb|left|Scenery of [[Donghwasa]]]]
On the outskirts of the city, mountains keep many traditional temples such as [[Donghwasa]], [[Pagyesa]], and [[Buinsa]]. Donghwasa is a Buddhist temple that was built by Priest Geukdal-hwasang in 493, and many artifacts of the period are found around the temple. The International Tourist Zen Meditation Center is Korea's only Zen-themed center. Some lecture halls or memorial halls such as Dodong-seowon ({{Korean|labels=no|도동서원|道東書院}}) and Nokdong-seowon ({{Korean|labels=no|녹동서원|鹿洞書院}}) are also located in the suburbs.

Old villages have been preserved, such as the [[Otgol village]] (''Gyeongju Choi'' clan's original residence area) and the Inheung village (''Nampyeong Mun'''s). In the urban area, the [[Joseon]] period's administrative or educational buildings including [[Gyeongsang-gamyeong]] ({{Korean|hangul=경상감영|hanja=慶尙監營|labels=no}}) and [[Daegu-hyanggyo]] ({{Korean|hangul=대구향교|hanja=大邱鄕校|labels=no}}) also remain. The main gateway of the city in that period called [[Yeongnam-jeilmun]] ({{Korean|hangul=영남제일문|hanja=嶺南第一門|labels=no}}, meaning the first gateway in [[Yeongnam]]), has been restored in [[Mangudang Park]]. Western style modern architecture like [[Gyesan Cathedral]] and the old building of Jeil Church are preserved across the urban area. Gyesan Cathedral is the third oldest gothic church building in Korea<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tour.daegu.go.kr/best/best_list.php?mods=view&menu_mst_cd=0001&menu_slv_cd=0001&tour_mst_cd=000013&menu=01&page=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516150123/http://tour.daegu.go.kr/best/best_list.php?mods=view&menu_mst_cd=0001&menu_slv_cd=0001&tour_mst_cd=000013&menu=01&page=1 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-05-16 |script-title=ko:대구광역시 관광문화정보시스템 – 계산성당 |publisher=Daegu Metropolitan City |access-date=2009-11-23}}</ref> and the cathedral of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Daegu]] which is one of [[Roman Catholicism in South Korea|three archdioceses in South Korea]]. Several buildings, in the present [[Keisung Academy]] and the [[Kyungpook National University|KNU]] middle/high school, are famous too.

[[Yangnyeongsi]] ({{Korean|hangul=약령시|hanja=藥令市|labels=no}}) in Namseongno (often called Yakjeon-golmok) is the oldest market for Korean medicinal herbs in the country with a history of 350 years. Bongsan-dong which has some art galleries and studios is being developed as the artistic center of the city since the 1990s.

Nearby tourist attractions include [[Haeinsa]]—a [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhist]] temple that houses the ''[[Tripitaka Koreana]]'' (a woodblock edition of the ''[[Tripitaka]]'' and one of the world's oldest extant complete collections of the Buddhist scriptures). Haeinsa is located in Gayasan National Park of [[Hapcheon]], [[South Gyeongsang Province]]. The historic city of [[Gyeongju]], [[North Gyeongsang Province]], the capital of the ancient kingdom of [[Silla]] is located east of Daegu.

Mt. Palgong, Mt. Biseul, and Mt. Ap are the representative mountains in Daegu. Apsan, just in the southern part of the city, is the closest mountain from the urban area among them. It has many trails, [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples, a Korean War museum, and a gondola ride to the peak. Additionally, Waryongsan, Hamjisan, and Yongjibong are located in the city. These serve as neighborhood parks to the citizens. Mt.

In the urban area, several small mountains and hills play the same role. Dalseong Park, which sits inside a 1,500-year-old earth fortress, is a historic place of the city. It contains the city's only [[zoo]] and some monuments as well as the wall. [[Duryu Park]] or Duryusan is a large forest in the middle of the urban area. It has [[Daegu Tower]], [[Woobang Land]], Kolon Bandstand, Duryu Stadium, and many sports facilities. Daegu Tower, also called Woobang Tower or Duryu Tower, is the tallest contemporary structure (202 m) and a symbol of the city. Its observatory commands good views of the surroundings. Woobang Land is the largest amusement park out of the capital area. Many small gardens lie in the heart of the city, such as the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Park (Gukchae Bosang Park) and 2·28 Park. The former park includes Dalgubeol-daejong ({{Korean|hangul=달구벌대종|hanja=達句伐大鐘|labels=no}}), which means the Dalgubeol grand bell. The bell is struck every week and year. There is also a botanical garden with a variety of plants and flowers.

===Downtown and shopping===

[[Dongseongno]] ({{Korean|hangul=동성로|hanja=東城路|labels=no}}) is the downtown of Daegu lying from the [[Daegu Station]] to ''Jung-ang pachulso'' (central police station) near the Banwoldang subway station in the center of the city [[Jung District, Daegu|Jung-gu]]. It has the Jung-angno subway station as the nearest station from its heart. Like its name meaning the street in the east fortress, the eastern part of [[Daegu-eupseong]] ({{Korean|hangul=대구읍성|hanja=大邱邑城|labels=no}}, means the Daegu-Principality Fortress) was situated along this street. The fortress, however, had been demolished in the early 20th century. Although Daegu is the nation's third or fourth largest city, the Dongseongno area form the largest and the broadest downtown area in the whole country except the capital city, [[Seoul]]. In most cases, famous brands open their branch shop first here out of the Greater Seoul area.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=ko:[뜬다 이곳] 대구 동성로 거리 |url=https://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20090210026021 |access-date=2021-06-16 |website=[[Seoul Shinmun]] | date=10 February 2009 |language=ko |archive-date=2021-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624203651/https://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20090210026021 |url-status=live }}</ref>
[[File:Seomun Market Gate.JPG|thumb|The sign of the [[Seomun Market]]]]
Sub-downtowns in the city have its own commercial powers and colors. The area around the Seongseo Industrial Complex subway station in [[Dalseo District]] is a concentration of many amusement spots, and young people easily can be seen around [[Kyungpook National University]] in [[Buk District, Daegu|Buk-gu]]. ''Deuran-gil'' (means the street inside the field) in [[Suseong District]] is known for many restaurants.

The city has a number of department stores. Many of these belong to national or multinational chains, but the local [[Daegu Department Store]] also operates two branches, while another local chain, [[Donga Department Store]] operates four in the city proper. The six department stores among them gather at the downtown. The traditional markets such as [[Seomun Market]] and Chilseong Market sell all sorts of goods.

===Festivals===
Many traditional ceremonies and festivals in agrarian society disappeared in the process of modernization. A Confucian ritual ceremony called ''Seokjeondaeje'' is held at Daegu-hyanggyo every spring and autumn. The Yangnyeongsi herb medical festival and Otgol village festival are the contemporary festivals about traditional culture.

Lately in the city, enthusiasm about performing arts is growing and the local government is trying to meet its demand. [[Daegu International Opera Festival]] (DIOF) in October since 2003, [[Daegu International Musical Festival]] (DIMF), and [[Daegu International Bodypainting Festival]] (DIBF) are three of the most famous festivals on each field in Korea, although those have short histories.

Various festivals in various themes like the Colorful Daegu Festival, [[Dongseongno]] festival, [[Palgongsan]] maple festival, [[Biseulsan]] azalea festival, Korea in Motion Daegu, and so on, are held by the city, each ward, or the specific groups, all through the year.

On August 25 through August 31, 2008, Daegu hosted the first ever Asian Bodypainting Festival, a sister event of the [[World Bodypainting Festival]] in [[Seeboden]], Austria.

Each year the city is home to the Daegu International Jazz Festival: http://www.dijf.or.kr/

The Samsung Lions are a professional baseball team founded in 1982. They are based in the southeastern city of Daegu and are members of the [[KBO League]].

Daegu Football Club was founded as a community club at the end of 2002, and made their [[K League]] debut in 2003. Historically, Daegu have often placed in the lower reaches of the K League.

The club has since played in the 2021 and 2022 editions of AFC Champions League.

===Media===
There are three terrestrial TV broadcasting stations in the city: [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]] Daegu Broadcast Station, Daegu [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]], and [[Taegu Broadcasting Corporation|TBC]]. These are affiliated companies of central broadcasting stations in Seoul just like other [[Television in South Korea|local broadcasting companies]] in South Korea. TBC (Taegu Broadcasting Corporation) depends on [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]]. They cover to Gyeongsangbuk-do out of the city. Each television broadcasting company has its own radio station as well.

===International Daegu===
Daegu is largely a homogeneous community that includes few non-Koreans. However, a number of immigrants from [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] work in automotive-parts factories on the city's west side. In addition, there is a small group of English-speaking Westerners working in English schools and university programs. The American military bases are home to several hundred Americans. Recently Chinese students have begun studying Korean at universities in Daegu, and there is an increasing number of graduate and post-graduate students from other Asian countries. As elsewhere in Korea, Korean food overwhelmingly dominates; Chinese, Japanese and Western food forms the bulk of non-Korean food, but recently Indian and Russian foods have become available.

Daegu hosts three American military bases, [[Camp Henry]], [[Camp George]], and [[Camp Walker]]. Camp Walker houses Daegu High School, while Camp George has Daegu American School, the elementary and middle school for the bases (primarily for children of military personnel and US Military civilian employees). Although non-military employees can enroll their children at the school, most either home-school their children or send them to a small Christian private school which teaches about 25 children near the central business district of Daegu. Camp George contains most of the residences for married enlisted soldiers, while Camp Walker is the home to enlisted Sergeants Major and officers, Major and up. Camp Henry and Camp Walker are the primary work sites for military personnel.

'''Mosque Controversy'''   In December 2020, construction of a [[mosque]] in Daehyeon-dong for a Muslim community of 80-150 members comprising mainly staff and students of a local university, resulted in opposition from nearby residents who complained about the change in land use without prior consultation.<ref name="clash">{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2023/05/16/1176506770/mosque-project-tests-south-koreas-tolerance-for-increasing-diversity |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=2023-05-16 |accessdate=2023-05-17 |language=en-US |title=Mosque project tests South Korea's tolerance for increasing diversity |last=Kuhn |first=Anthony |work=[[All Things Considered]]}}</ref>[https://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.asp?newsIdx=328375] Construction was halted in 2021 by the district administrative office (having originally been approved by the same office) after residents voiced concerns.

The approval for change of land use within a residential area without consultation with local residents indicates a failure by the local district office to adequately support both communities, and of the authorities to mediate effective communication between the two groups. Notably, the Muslim community did not disseminate information to the local residents on its plans, despite local awareness of Muslim worship within a house on the site since 2014, and general acceptance of what some residents saw as night-time disturbance during the time of Ramadan.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.asp?newsIdx=328375 | title=Mosque construction triggers standoff in Daegu | date=3 May 2022 }}</ref> Since the dispute began however, dialogue between the local residents and the Muslim community has been hampered by third parties in Korea, according to the Muslim community spokesperson.<ref name="pig" /> As of May 2023, construction was underway; differences had not been resolved.<ref name="pig" />
