'''Lubusz Voivodeship''' ({{langx|pl|województwo lubuskie}} {{IPA|pl|vɔjɛˈvut͡stfɔ luˈbuskʲɛ||LL-Q809 (pol)-KaMan-województwo lubuskie.wav}}) is a [[voivodeships of Poland|voivodeship]] ([[province]]) in western [[Poland]].

It was created on January 1, 1999, out of the former [[Gorzów Voivodeship]] and [[Zielona Góra Voivodeship]], pursuant to the [[Polish local government reforms]] adopted in 1998. The province's name recalls the historic [[Lubusz Land]]<ref>It is likely that it was a response to the names of some German military units; they have been named after lands that since at least 1945  belong to Poland and the very city of [[Lebus|Lubusz]] is located just outside the Polish border in Germany.</ref> (''[[Lebus]]'' or ''Lubus''), although parts of the voivodeship belong to the historic regions of [[Lower Silesia]], [[Greater Poland]] and [[Lusatia]].

The functions of regional capital are shared between two cities: [[Gorzów Wielkopolski]] and [[Zielona Góra]]. Gorzów serves as the seat of the centrally-appointed [[voivode]], or governor, and Zielona Góra is the seat of the elected regional assembly ([[Voivodeship sejmik|sejmik]]) and the executive elected by that assembly, headed by a marshal (''marszałek''). In addition, the voivodeship includes a third city ([[Nowa Sól]]) and a number of towns. 

The region is mainly flat, with many lakes and woodlands. In the south, around Zielona Góra, grapes are cultivated.

Lubusz Voivodeship borders [[West Pomeranian Voivodeship]] to the north, [[Greater Poland Voivodeship]] to the east, [[Lower Silesian Voivodeship]] to the south, and [[Germany]] ([[Brandenburg]] and [[Saxony]]) to the west.

==History==
[[File:Zary walls.JPG|thumb|left|Medieval town walls of [[Żary]], one of the oldest towns in the province, first mentioned in 1007]]
The first leaders of the Polans, [[Mieszko I]] and especially [[Bolesław I the Brave]] added a number of surrounding territories to the newly established core Polish state, and Lubusz Land came under Polish rule. Part of the historic province was located on the western bank of the [[Oder River]], where the main settlement Lubusz, later known as the German town of [[Lebus]], was located. The entire territory of the present Lubusz Voivodeship was part of Poland by 1002. The oldest towns in the region, dating back over 1,000 years, include [[Trzciel]], [[Skwierzyna]], [[Iłowa]], [[Szprotawa]], [[Jasień, Lubusz Voivodeship|Jasień]], [[Krosno Odrzańskie]], [[Międzyrzecz]] and [[Żary]], with most other towns also founded in the [[Middle Ages]], including the current regional capitals of [[Zielona Góra]] and [[Gorzów Wielkopolski]]. The youngest towns are [[Łęknica]], [[Czerwieńsk]], [[Nowa Sól]], [[Szlichtyngowa]] and [[Zbąszynek]], all either first mentioned or established in the later periods.

[[File:Castle in Zagan (3).jpg|thumb|left|[[Żagań]] with its castle was a ducal seat for several centuries]]
Following the fragmentation of Poland into smaller provincial duchies, various portions of the present Lubusz Voivodeship were part of various duchies, initially the duchies of [[Duchy of Greater Poland|Greater Poland]] and [[Duchy of Silesia|Silesia]], and later also [[Duchy of Legnica|Legnica]], [[Duchy of Głogów|Głogów]], [[Duchy of Lubusz|Lubusz]] and [[Duchy of Żagań|Żagań]], ruled by various lines of the [[Piast dynasty]]. Overtime, portions of the present Lubusz Voivodeship were lost by Poland. In 1250 the Lubusz Land was acquired by the [[House of Ascania|Ascanian]] [[margrave]]s of [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]. In 1319–1326 it was contested by various Polish and German rulers, before falling back to Brandenburg. After Brandenburg passed to the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian Crown]] in 1373, [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]] made a peaceful attempt to regain the northern portion of the area. In 1402, the Bohemian rulers reached an agreement with Poland in [[Kraków]]. Poland was to buy and re-incorporate the northern outskirts of the present Lubusz Voivodeship,<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogalski|first=Leon|year=1846|title=Dzieje Krzyżaków oraz ich stosunki z Polską, Litwą i Prussami, poprzedzone rysem dziejów wojen krzyżowych. Tom II|language=pl|location=Warszawa|pages=59–60}}</ref> but eventually the Bohemian rulers sold the area to the [[Teutonic Order]], who in turn sold it back to Brandenburg in 1454 to raise funds for [[Thirteen Years’ War (1454–1466)|war against Poland]]. The southern part of the current voivodeship remained part of the duchies of Żagań and Głogów, ruled by the houses of Piast and [[Jagiellonian dynasty|Jagiellon]], with the Żagań duchy eventually passing to houses of foreign background, including Czech, Saxon and French, whereas other areas were gradually incorporated directly into the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]. In 1635, most of the south-western part of the present Lubusz Voivodeship passed from Bohemia to [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], and from 1697 formed part of [[Poland-Saxony]]. In the 18th century, [[Wschowa]] was an important [[royal city in Poland|royal city of Poland]], as it often hosted Polish kings and several sessions of the Polish Senate, hence being dubbed the "unofficial capital of Poland". King [[Augustus III of Poland]] also often stopped in [[Brody, Żary County|Brody]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gazetalubuska.pl/jedzmy-do-brodow-tu-na-pierwszy-rzut-oka-niewiele-sie-dzieje-ale-pozory-myla/ar/7731323|title=Jedźmy do Brodów.

In 1701, the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] was established, which included Brandenburg-held Lubusz Land, and various areas were eventually gradually annexed by Prussia in the following centuries, starting with the south-eastern part of the current voivodeship in 1742, followed by eastern portions (western outskirts of Greater Poland) in [[Second Partition of Poland|1793]] (briefly regained by Poles in 1807–1815 as part of the short-lived [[Duchy of Warsaw]]), and the south-western part in 1815. Within Prussia and Germany the territory was divided between the provinces of [[Neumark]]/[[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], [[South Prussia]]/[[Province of Posen|Posen]], and [[Province of Silesia|Silesia]]/[[Province of Lower Silesia|Lower Silesia]].

During [[World War II]], the [[Oflag II-C]], [[Stalag III-C]], [[Stalag VIII-C]] and [[Stalag Luft III]] major [[German prisoner-of-war camps in World War II|German prisoner-of-war camps]] for Polish, [[French prisoners of war in World War II|French]], British, Belgian, Canadian, Serbian, Italian, American, Australian, New Zealander, Soviet, Norwegian, Czech, Slovak, South African, Dutch, Greek, Yugoslav, [[Senegalese Tirailleurs|Senegalese]], Algerian and Moroccan POWs were operated in the territory. The latter was the site of the "Great Escape" in 1944. There are museums at the site of the camps in [[Dobiegniew]] and [[Żagań]], and there is a memorial to the victims of the [[Stalag Luft III murders]] in Żagań. Particularly infamous camps in the region were the Oderblick [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|labor]] education camp in [[Świecko]] and the [[Sonnenburg concentration camp]] in [[Słońsk]], in which Polish, Belgian, French, Bulgarian, Dutch, Yugoslav, Russian, Italian, Ukrainian, Luxembourgish, Danish, Norwegian, Czech, Slovak and other prisoners were held, and many died.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://poszukiwania.ipn.gov.pl/bbp/aktualnosci/13596,Swiecko-Lager-Schwetig-Odnaleziono-szczatki-21-osob.html|title=Świecko (Lager Schwetig): Odnaleziono szczątki 21 osób|website=Instytut Pamięci Narodowej|access-date=17 May 2024|language=pl}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://dzieje.pl/aktualnosci/slonsk-73-rocznica-zaglady-wiezniow-niemieckiego-obozu-sonnenburg|title=Słońsk: 73. rocznica zagłady więźniów niemieckiego obozu Sonnenburg|website=dzieje.pl|access-date=17 May 2024|language=pl}}</ref> There were also eleven [[List of subcamps of Gross-Rosen|subcamps]] of the [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp]] and a subcamp of the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]], in which mostly Jewish and Polish, but also French, Russian, Czech, Italian, Greek, Yugoslav, Dutch, Romanian, Hungarian, Lithuanian and German prisoners were held.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Toczewski|first=Andrzej|year=2017|title=Filie obozów koncentracyjnych na Środkowym Nadodrzu|journal=Ziemia Lubuska|location=Zielona Góra|language=pl|volume=3|pages=93–126|issn=2450-3355}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.gross-rosen.eu/historia-kl-gross-rosen/filie-obozu-gross-rosen/|title=Subcamps of KL Gross- Rosen|website=Gross-Rosen Museum in Rogoźnica|access-date=17 May 2024}}</ref> [[Międzyrzecz|Obrzyce]] was the place of ''[[Aktion T4]]'' murders of mentally ill and disabled people.

Under the terms laid down by [[Joseph Stalin]] in the [[Potsdam Agreement]], the borders of Poland and Germany were redrawn and the area of the Lubusz Voivodeship fell within the new borders of Poland.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Potsdam Conference, 1945 |url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/potsdam-conf |website=United States Office of The Historian}}</ref><ref>https://www.nato.int/ebookshop/video/declassified/doc_files/potsdam%20agreement.pdf Potsdam Agreement Protocol of the Proceedings, August l, 1945</ref>

In 1998, [[Cabinet of Jerzy Buzek|the government]] of [[Jerzy Buzek]] decided to introduce an [[Administrative divisions of Poland|administrative reform]], with its principles including the restoration of counties and a steep reduction in the number of voivodeships. A general consensus existed among scholars that the local administration exercised through the [[Voivodeships of Poland (1975–1998)|49 existing voivodeships established in 1975]] was inefficient, anachronistic, impractical, detrimental to maintaining regional identity, and untenable. However, the reform draft accepted by the government surprised the public and caused widespread outcry, as its authors foresaw creation of only 12 large voivodships, thus going much further than the widely expected reconstitution of the 17 voivodeships existing prior to the [[Voivodeships of Poland (1975–1998)|1975 reform]]. As a consequence, the original draft made no provision for a separate Lubusz voivodeship – Gorzów was to become along with [[Kostrzyn, Greater Poland Voivodeship|Kostrzyn]], [[Strzelce Krajeńskie]] and [[Drezdenko]] a part of [[West Pomeranian Voivodeship]], Zielona Góra was to be included along with Krosno, Nowa Sól, Żagań, Gubin and Żary in the [[Lower Silesian Voivodeship]], while a narrow horizontal strip encompassing  [[Międzyrzecz]], [[Sulęcin]], [[Świebodzin]], [[Słubice]] and [[Sulechów]] was to be assigned to the [[Greater Poland Voivodeship]] as a bizarre sort-of corridor to the German border. However, mass protests broke out as a result in the cities such as Bydgoszcz, Koszalin, Opole or Kielce. Many of the people opposing the draft reform initially demanded retaining as many as 25 voivodeships (including the 2 ones seated in Gorzów and Zielona Góra), a number nevertheless widely regarded as a demand intentionally excessive to serve as an initial negotiating bargain, actually aiming to restore the 17 voivodeships existing prior to 1975 as an ultimate compromise. As Poland was at the time governed under political cohabitation, the opposition party constituting the political background of the President decided to capitalize on the popular discontent which erupted against the government on an unanticipated scale; the most obvious mean readily available for the opposition was a presidential veto, which in fact ensued. In order to salvage the reform from being killed altogether, the government was, in the face of lacking the supermajority required to overturn the veto at the time, forced to reconsider the original shape of the reform and to reconcile it with the reservations of the President and his political background, with the result of a compromise adjustment increasing the number of voivodeships to 16, with Lubusz Voivodeship included among the four additional ones created according to the agreement.
[[File:Krainy-historyczne-Polski.png|thumb|Historical regions in Lubusz Voivodeship and in Poland]]

The path leading to such and outcome was far from smooth. The government made an effort to highlight and exploit the decades-long animosity between the approximately same-size two principal cities, spreading scare against its inevitable re-ignition and explosion in any of these two cities after designating the other one as the voivodeship capital, and hoping to use the engineered scare as the main argument in the ongoing discussions against creating the Lubusz voivodeship, The animosity, existing indeed between the cities, has been historically rooted in a widespread perception among Gorzów inhabitants that the 1950 decision to designate Zielona Góra as the voivodeship capital instead of their larger and more populous city, was taken by the anticlerical communist government due to a hidden motivation of punishing Gorzów for becoming the see of the newly established Roman Catholic [[apostolic administration]] governing the majority of the [[Recovered Territories]], with the ensuing discrimination of the city by the voivodeship authorities in the years 1950-1975 in terms of establishing any new public cultural and educational institutions, other public investments or public funds allocations, in vivid contrast to the unjust favoring of their own seat, the city of Zielona Góra; a sentiment reinforced further by the surprise relocation of the see of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Gorzów]] to Zielona Góra in 1992, renamed as a result the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Zielona Góra-Gorzów]], and finally and perhaps most importantly, by the historical, perpetual and almost sacred rivalry between the [[Speedway in Poland|motorcycle speedway]] clubs located in both cities. The objective of the local elites in Zielona Góra was in turn to become a single capital centre, reverting to the situation before 1975, while any prospect of sharing the governing institutions was for a long time treated with their hostility. In spite of that, the looming threat of a "everybody lose" scenario set to materialize in case of a possible implementation of the original reform draft, paved the way for neutralizing this argument through forcing both rival sides into the breakthrough reconciliation accord known as the Paradyż Agreement, brokered by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Zielona Góra-Gorzów and formalized in a document signed during a highly publicized local summit in the [[Gościkowo|Gościkowo-Paradyż Abbey]] on 13 March 1998. This compromise agreement, was negotiated and concluded between the delegations of both rival cities, composed of the respectively aligned most powerful local and national scene politicians and business people, with its most important provision being the unusual arrangement to divide and distribute the governing institutions of the voivodeship more or less equally between the two cities. On the basis of this broadly supported agreement, an effective public pressure endorsed jointly by the two centers was successfully exerted on the central government which ultimately acquiesced to the demand of establishing Lubusz Voivodeship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lzg24.pl/artykul/aktualnosci/warto-bylo-oni-tworzyli-nasze-wojewodztwo|title=Warto było?

Nevertheless, creating any new type of public institution at voivodeship level in Poland continues to ignite almost automatically a fierce battle in the Lubusz Voivodeship regarding the seat of the institution. There have also been numerous attempts to relocate some of the existing public institutions under various pretexts from one city to another, in some cases successful, as well as of merging a pair of equal institutions of a type existing in both cities, in order to make one of them a branch of the other,  with obscure or no justification in most cases for such merger. Nevertheless, a general local majority consensus prevails that the compromise, although unsatisfactory for any of the two cities, spared both of them the fate of a number of cities which lost in 1999 entirely the status of a voivodeship capital and all voivodeship-level institutions, along with the associated attractiveness and prestige of the city as a place to live, crucial for its growth, with the ensuing profoundly detrimental phenomena.

==Geography==
The Lubusz Voivodeship is a land of forests and lakes; forests cover 48% of the area. The river [[Oder]], flowing through the voivodeship, is one of the few large European rivers retaining [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|broadleaved]] and [[Riparian forest|riparian forests]]. Areas with the highest natural values are protected as national parks ([[Drawa National Park]] and [[Warta Mouth National Park]]), [[landscape park (protected area)|landscape parks]] and [[Nature reserve|wildlife reserves]]. The 19th century [[Muskau Park]], located on both sides of the [[Germany–Poland border|Polish–German border]], has entered the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]]. The voivodeship abounds in lakes, especially in its central and northern parts; around those lakes numerous bathing resorts, holiday centres and farms offering tourist services have been established.<ref>{{cite book|title= Polska — Rozwój Regionów |date=2010 |author=Związek Województw Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej (Union of the Voivodeships of the Republic of Poland)}}</ref>

==Cuisine==
The voivodeship, especially its northern part, is a notable for production of honey, with several varieties listed as [[traditional food]]s by the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (Poland)|Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland]], and the Saint Michael's Honey Fair held annually in Gorzów Wielkopolski.

The southern part of the voivodeship with [[Zielona Góra]] is one of the leading [[winemaking]] regions of Poland, and other traditional beverages from the voivodeship are [[Beer in Poland|beer]], [[mead]], [[nalewka|nalewki]] and [[vodka]].

Various types of traditional Polish [[kiełbasa]], also designated as traditional foods by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland, are produced in the [[Nowa Sól County|Nowa Sól]], [[Wschowa County|Wschowa]], [[Zielona Góra County|Zielona Góra]], [[Żagań County|Żagań]] and [[Żary County|Żary]] counties in the southern part of the Lubusz Voivodeship, whereas [[Siedlisko, Nowa Sól County]] produces a variety of traditional cheeses and [[quark]]s.
