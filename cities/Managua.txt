'''Managua''' ({{IPA|es|maˈnaɣwa}}) is the [[capital city|capital]] and largest city of [[Nicaragua]], and one of the [[List of largest cities in Central America|largest cities]] in [[Central America]]. Located on the shores of [[Lake Managua]], the city had an estimated population of 1,055,247 as of 2020,<ref name=pop/> and a population of 1,401,687<ref name=pop /> in its [[metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite report |url=http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/NIC/00048774_Prodoc%2000059044.pdf |title=Proyecto NIC10-59044: Promoción de un Transporte Ambientalmente Sostenible para Managua Metropolitana |page=9 |publisher=[[UNDP]], [[Government of Nicaragua]] |date=July 2008 |access-date=2016-04-24 |archive-date=2016-05-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509002742/http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/documents/projects/NIC/00048774_Prodoc%2000059044.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> The city also serves as the seat of [[Managua Department]].

Founded in 1819, Managua became the national capital in 1852.<ref name="LP" /><ref name="Resurge" /> The city underwent a rapid expansion and urbanization between 1842 and 1930, leading it to become one of the most developed cities in Central America. Several earthquakes have affected the city's growth, especially the [[1931 Nicaragua earthquake|1931 earthquake]] and the [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake|1972 earthquake]], but the city has been rebuilt several times. Today, the city is a major economic hub for both the country and Central America.

==Etymology==
There are two possible origins for the name "Managua". It may have originated from the term ''Mana-ahuac'', which in the [[Nahuatl]] language translates to "adjacent to the water" or site "surrounded by water".<ref name="LP"/><ref name="Resurge" /> Or, it may have come from the [[Mangue language]], where the word ''managua'' was said to mean "place of the big man" or "chief".<ref name="Footprint">{{cite book|author=Richard Arghiris|title=Nicaragua Footprint Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NaV8AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA36|date=April 10, 2014|publisher=Footprint Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-907263-89-7|page=36}}</ref> Residents of the city are called ''managuas'', ''managüenses'', or ''capitalinos''.

===Origins===

Other [[archeological]] evidence, mainly in the form of ceramics and statues made of volcanic stone, like the ones found on the island of [[Zapatera]], and [[petroglyphs]] found on [[Ometepe]] island, contribute to the increasing knowledge of Nicaragua's ancient history.

===Early history===
Founded as a [[pre-Columbian]] fishing town, the city was incorporated in 1819 and given the name ''Leal Villa de Santiago de Managua''. Efforts to make Managua the capital of Nicaragua began in 1824, after the Central American nations formally attained their independence from Spain. Nicaragua became an independent nation in 1838. Managua's location between the rival cities of León and Granada made it a logical compromise site. Hence, Managua was officially selected as the nation's capital in 1852.<ref name="Capital">{{cite book|last=Cybriwsky|first=Roman Adrian|title=Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qb6NAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA177|date=May 23, 2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-61069-248-9|page=177}}</ref>
[[File:Nicaragua. National Palace, Managua LCCN2016820953 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Managua, circa 1910–19]]
Between 1852 and 1930, Managua underwent extensive urbanization, becoming a base of governance, infrastructure and services.<ref name="LP"/> The city was hampered by major floods in 1876 and 1885. A [[1931 Nicaragua earthquake|disastrous earthquake in 1931]] and large fire in 1936<ref>[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA081FF83C5E167B93C2AB178FD85F428385F9&scp=1 "Managua trade area is swept by flames"], ''The New York Times''. April 20, 1936. Page 7.</ref> destroyed much of the city. Under the rule of [[Anastasio Somoza García]] and his family (1936–1979), the city was rebuilt and began to grow rapidly. New government buildings were erected, industry developed, and universities were established. The city's development caught the attention of [[Irving Fields]] and [[Albert Gamse]], who composed a [[Managua, Nicaragua (song)|musical piece]] about the city that became popular in the 1940s through the performances of [[Freddy Martin]], [[Guy Lombardo]] and [[Kay Kyser]].<ref name=Whitburn>

</ref>  Managua had become Central America's most developed city. Today's references differentiate the pre-1970s Managua by labeling it as ''La Antigua Ciudad,'' which in English translates to "The Ancient City" or "The Old City".

===20th century===
[[File:Managua terremoto 31.jpg|thumb|left|Aftermath of the [[1931 Nicaragua earthquake|1931 earthquake]]]]
Managua's progress came to a sudden halt after it suffered a [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake|second major earthquake]] on December 23, 1972, which destroyed 90% of the city's downtown and killed more than 19,120 people.<ref>{{cite news |title=Deadly history of earthquakes: 23 December 1972 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/2059330.stm |work=BBC News |access-date=2007-08-19 }}</ref> Infrastructure was severely damaged and rehabilitation or restoration of buildings was nearly impossible and at the time, Managua's limited resources had to be directed to other disaster relief purposes. Managua's ability to cope with the disaster was also limited. Surviving fire squadrons and ambulance companies were not able to handle the skyrocketing demand for their services. Some buildings burned to the ground, while the foundations of others simply gave way. Not able to rebuild quickly, the city directed emergency workers to clear away much of the city's ruins quickly while burying the deceased in mass graves. Residences, government buildings and entire avenues were demolished. Escaping the city center, earthquake victims found refuge in the outskirts of the city. To add insult to injury, corruption within the [[Somoza Family|Somoza]] regime which allocated part of the relief funds hindered the reconstruction of the city's center which remains somewhat isolated from the rest of the capital.
[[File:Palacio Loma.jpg|thumb|right|Palacio Loma, Nicaragua's presidential residence, in the 1950s]]
The [[Nicaraguan Revolution]] of 1979 to overthrow the Somoza regime and the 11-year-long [[Contra War]] of the 1980s further devastated the city and its economy. To make matters worse, a series of natural disasters, including [[Hurricane Mitch]] in 1998, made economic recovery more difficult. After winning the presidential election in 1990, the [[National Opposition Union]] began the reconstruction of Managua in earnest. More than 300,000 Nicaraguans returned from abroad bringing their expertise and needed capital. Businesses mushroomed, new housing projects and schools were constructed, the airport was expanded and modernized, streets were widened, older malls were repaired and new ones were built, and buildings were cleaned up.

===21st century===
[[File:10th anniversary of the Nicaraguan revolution in Managua, 1989.jpg|thumb|left|10th anniversary of the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]] in 1989]]
In 2006, after the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] came back into power, literacy, health and reconstruction programs were expanded.

New governmental buildings, galleries, museums, apartment buildings, squares, promenades, monuments, boat tours on Lake Managua, restaurants, nighttime entertainment, and broad avenues have resurrected part of downtown Managua's former vitality. Commercial activity, however, remains low. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Residential and commercial buildings have been constructed on the outskirts of the city, in the same locales that were once used as refugee camps for those who were homeless after the earthquake. These booming locales have been of concern to the government because of their close proximity to Lake Managua. 

The construction of a new sewer system and the redirecting of waste water to a new water treatment plant at Las Mercedes in Eastern Managua in May 2009 relieved old concerns over water pollution and native wildlife, and brought some residents closer to the old city center and the rest of the mainland.<ref>[https://www.enacal.com.ni/informacion/doc/broshure2-2007-2010.pdf ENACAL - Más Aguas y Saneamientos 2007-2010]</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Managua, Nicaragua (cropped).JPG|thumb|Aerial view of Managua]]
Managua is located on the southern shores of [[Lake Managua]], also known as Lake Xolotlán. Lake Managua contains the same fish species as larger [[Lake Cocibolca]] in southeastern Nicaragua, except for the freshwater sharks found exclusively in the latter. Once a Managuan scenic highlight, the lake has been polluted from the dumping of chemical and waste water since 1927. A new sewer system and the redirecting of waste water to a new [[waste water treatment]] plant at Las Mercedes funded by the German government to decontaminate the lake was expected to be the largest in Central America and was inaugurated in 2009.<ref name="CL">{{cite news |    title=Topic 4: Megaproject to Clean up Lake Managua Begins | url =http://www.nicanet.org/hotline.php?id=218#topic4 |work=Nicaragua Network | access-date = 2007-07-14 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070702203225/http://www.nicanet.org/hotline.php?id=218| archive-date = July 2, 2007}}</ref><ref>[http://www.centralamericalink.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=873:nicaragua-inaugurates-86-million-treatment-plan-to-clean-up-lake-managua&catid=47:link-news&Itemid=26 Nicaragua inaugurates $86 million treatment plan to clean up Lake Managua] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708133042/http://www.centralamericalink.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=873%3Anicaragua-inaugurates-86-million-treatment-plan-to-clean-up-lake-managua&catid=47%3Alink-news&Itemid=26 |date=2011-07-08 }}</ref>

These works of progress have relieved old concerns over water pollution and the endangering of native wildlife have brought some residents closer to the old city center and the rest of the mainland. {{Cn|date=November 2021}}

Managua's city area extends about {{convert|544|km2|0|abbr=off|sp=us}}, essentially south from the south shore of Lake Managua. The lakeshore is at an altitude of {{convert|55|m|0|abbr=off|sp=us}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]], and the city climbs as it gets towards the Sierras de Managua further south where it is over {{convert|700|m|0|abbr=off|sp=us}} above sea level.

Geologically, the city lies on fault lines, thus [[seismologist]]s predict that Managua will experience a severe earthquake every 50 years or less.<ref name="Euraque, Dario A 2009"/>

Managua features four smaller crater lakes or [[lagoon]]s within [[city limit]]s. The most centrally located is the Tiscapa Lagoon in the [[Tiscapa Lagoon Natural Reserve]].

===Flora===
[[File:Paseo Xolotlán.jpg|thumb|left|Paseo Xolotlán, on the shores of [[Lake Managua]]]] 
Managua, due to its tropical climate, varied topography, rich fertile soils, and abundant rain and water sources, boasts a great variety of [[flora]]. Many different types of trees, some of which are not found elsewhere in the world, appear, including ''chilamate''s, ''ceibo''s, ''pochote''s, ''genízaro''s, ''tigüilote''s, [[royal palm]]s, ''piñuela''s and ''madroño''s (Nicaragua's [[National symbols of Nicaragua|national tree]]) surround the city. During the rainy season (May to November), Managua becomes a lush city due to many [[palm tree|palm]]s, [[bushes]], and other plants and trees which dominate the city's appearance.<ref name="VNM">{{cite news |    title=Managua |    url=http://www.vianica.com/visit/managua |    work=ViaNica |    access-date=2007-08-19 |    archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822222919/http://www.vianica.com/visit/managua |    archive-date=2007-08-22 |    url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Climate===
Managua, like much of Western Nicaragua, except for the Sierras, has a [[tropical climate]] with constant temperatures averaging between {{convert|28|and|32|C|F}}. Under [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen's climate classification]], the city has a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] (''Aw''). The city spends most of the year seeing strong heat and a bright shining sun. The temperature varies from {{convert|72|°F|1}} at night to {{convert|86|°F}} during the daytime. Temperatures are highest in March, April and May when the sun lies directly overhead and the summer rainfall has yet to begin. As stated before Managua only has two seasons, the dry and the rainy. The rainy season occurs between mid-May and mid-November, while the dry-season occurs between mid-November and the middle or end of May. During the dry season the countryside gets dull and even dusty.

The museum is located in west Managua in the Acahualinca neighborhood. In addition to the footprints, the museum also displays artifacts found in other localities around the country. Artifacts such as [[mammoth]] footprints, pre-Columbian tools, a skull from [[León, Nicaragua|León Viejo]], and a small collection of pottery, among other archeological objects.<ref>{{cite news |    title=Acahualinca Footprints Museum |  url =http://www.nicaragua.com/museums/acahualinca-footprints/ |work=Nicaragua.com |  access-date = 2007-09-18 }}</ref>

===Tiscapa Lagoon===
[[File:Tiscapa Lagoon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tiscapa Lagoon Natural Reserve]]]]
Tiscapa Lagoon, located within the [[Tiscapa Lagoon Natural Reserve]] is just south of Managua's Historical Center. 
The reserve is located within Managua's city limits, and is a [[tourist attraction]]. Restaurants and stores line the walls of the lagoon. 

Leading up to the lagoon is ''Calle del Comercio'' (Commerce Street), which leads to the ''Monumento al Liberalismo'' (Monument to Liberalism), built in the late 1930s by [[Nationalist Liberal Party|the Liberal party]] in honor of President Anastasio Somoza García. Nearby is the Monument to Sandino which is a silhouette of [[Augusto C. Sandino]], one of Nicaragua's national heroes. The monument stands 59&nbsp;feet tall.<ref name="LT">{{cite news |    title=Monumento al General Augusto Cesar Sandino |  url =http://www.manfut.org/monumentos/sandino.html |work=Manfut |  access-date = 2007-08-20 |language=es }}</ref> The monument was proposed by [[Ernesto Cardenal]] and is protected by the [[Military of Nicaragua|Nicaraguan military]]. The Sandino monument was constructed on top of the wreckage of the old [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic-style]] presidential palace commissioned by President Sacasa in the late 1920s but long used by the Somoza Family as their personal residence. Also on the crater lip of Tiscapa is the ''Mazmorras'', a prison where current President [[Daniel Ortega]] and many other [[political prisoner]]s were tortured during the Somoza regime.<ref name="LTM"/>

===Dennis Martínez National Stadium===
[[File:Estadio Nacional Dennis Martinez .jpg|thumb|right|[[Dennis Martínez National Stadium]]]]
The [[Dennis Martínez National Stadium]] was built in 1948 and was the largest stadium in Central America at the end of its construction. It survived the 1972 earthquake. The stadium was named in honor of Nicaragua's first baseball player to play in [[Major League Baseball]]. It serves as a venue for [[baseball]] and [[soccer]] games, as well as concerts and religious events. The Dennis Martínez National Stadium has a capacity for 40,000, making it the largest stadium in Nicaragua.<ref>{{cite news |    title=National Stadium: Baseball matches and more |  url =http://www.vianica.com/activity/43/national-stadium-baseball-matches-and-more |work=ViaNica |  access-date = 2007-08-19 }}</ref>

===Old Cathedral===
[[File:Antigua catedral de Managua (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Old Cathedral of Managua]]]]
The ''Catedral de Santiago'' (St. James' Cathedral), also known as the [[Old Cathedral of Managua]] was designed by [[Belgians|Belgian]] architects, and the iron that was used to shape the core of the cathedral was shipped from Belgium. Construction lasted from 1928 to 1938, overseen by Pablo Dambach, who was a Belgian engineer residing in Managua. The architects had been inspired by the [[Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris|church of Saint-Sulpice]] in Paris, France.<ref>[http://www.canal2tv.com/Noticias/Septiembre%202006.html] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The St. James' Cathedral became the first cathedral in the Western Hemisphere to be built entirely of concrete on a metal frame.{{cn|date=May 2022}} The cathedral survived the 1931 earthquake, but was heavily damaged during the 1972 earthquake, which eventually led to the construction of a new cathedral located in another part of Managua.{{cn|date=March 2022}} Restoration of the old cathedral has appeared to be possible.{{cn|date=March 2022}}

===New Cathedral===
[[File:Managua Cathedral 2017 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Managua|New Cathedral of Managua]]]]
The [[Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Managua|Metropolitan Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception]], more commonly referred to as the New Cathedral, was designed by architect [[Ricardo Legorreta]] and inaugurated in 1993.<ref>{{cite news | title=Nicaragua Briefs: Obando's New Cathedral Off to a Strange Start | url=http://www.envio.org.ni/articulo/1722 | work=Envío | access-date=2007-10-09 | archive-date=2020-07-28 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728144106/https://www.envio.org.ni/articulo/1722 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The New Cathedral was built to replace the Old Cathedral downtown that had been damaged during the 1972 earthquake. Upon the completion of its construction, the New Cathedral generated controversy among tourists and locals because of its bland and dull appearance. Critics pointed to the fact that buildings of particular importance, especially those of colonial heritage, were painted in bright colors. Such a building whose intention was to serve as a place of worship was expected to have some sort of vibrant color. Eventually, the church's original concrete and gray surface became accepted and Catholic pilgrims began to embrace the church as it was.

== Government ==
[[File:Asamblea Nicaragua.png|thumb|left|[[National Assembly (Nicaragua)|National Assembly of Nicaragua]]]]
Managua is governed by a [[Mayor of Managua|Mayor]], Deputy Mayor and City Council. Since 2001, the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] has held a majority on the city council.

===Urban planning===

==Media==
Managua is the home of most national broadcasting television channels as well as the major national newspapers. Some of the larger television channels include: [[Televicentro (Canal 2)|Canal 2]], [[Telenica (Canal8)|Telenica]], [[Canal 10 (Nicaragua)|Canal 10]], [[Canal 15 (Nicaragua)|Canal 15 (100% Noticias)]], and several others.  There are numerous radio stations in Managua, some of which tend to have political, social, or religious affiliations.

==Transportation==

===Roads===
[[File:Avenida Roosevelt.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Avenida Roosevelt]]
Transportation-wise, Managua is one of Nicaragua's best positioned cities. All of Nicaragua's main roads lead to Managua, and there are good public transportation connections to and from the capital. There are four main highways that lead into Managua. The [[Pan-American Highway]] enters the city from the north, connecting Managua to Nicaragua's northern and central departments. This highway is commonly referred to as the ''Northern Highway.''

The ''Southern Highway'', the southern part of the Pan-American highway, connects Managua to southern departments Carazo, Rivas and others.

The ''Carretera A Masaya'' connects Managua to the departments of Masaya and Granada.

The newly reconstructed ''Carretera A León'' connects Managua with León.

All of these highways are in good condition, with little traffic congestion. Infrastructure on the highways is well maintained. This also tends to be true for cities and towns that are served or are in close distance with the freeways. However, this does not yield truthfully for cities and towns who tend to be considerably further from the main highway roads. Nicaraguan bus companies, often referred to as ''Chicken Buses'', serve both urban and rural areas to remedy the lack of sufficient infrastructure that plagues these towns or villages.
[[File:Carretera A Masaya Y Downtown Managua.jpg|thumb|right|Carretera a Masaya]]
Transportation infrastructure has grown outside of Managua and other Pacific coast cities and departments in recent years.  A road from the river port city of El Rama to Pearl Lagoon, located in the [[Región Autónoma de la Costa Caribe Sur|South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region]], was completed in 2007.<ref>Schmidt K.M. and D.B.Kramer. 2010. Road development and market access on Nicaragua's Caribbean coast: implications for household fishing and farming practices. Environmental Conservation. 36(4):289–300.</ref>  El Rama is connected by highway to Managua.  Managua and Puerto Cabezas, located in the [[Región Autónoma de la Costa Caribe Norte|North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region]] are also connected via road.  A third road,  under construction, will connect Bluefields, [[Región Autónoma de la Costa Caribe Sur|South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region]] with Managua via Nueva Guinea.<ref>Salgado, J. 2011. Carretera unirá a Bluefields con Nueva Guinea. El Nuevo Diario. 11/05/2011</ref>  Traveling by airplane is more efficient than traveling by these roads due to the poor conditions, especially in the rainy season.  Domestic flights are operated by [[La Costeña (airline)|La Costeña]] from the international airport.

===Airport===
[[File:Sandino International Airport (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Augusto C. Sandino International Airport|Managua International Airport]]]]
The [[Augusto C. Sandino International Airport]] (formerly Managua International Airport) is the largest and only international airport in Nicaragua. It recently inaugurated its over US$52 million extension and renovation partly financed by Spain.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Geyer |first=Enrique Bolaños |date=20 July 2006 |title=INAUGURACION TERMINAL AEREA AEROPUERTO INTERNACIONAL MANAGUA |url=https://sajurin.enriquebolanos.org/docs/Inaugurar%20-%20Aeropuerto%20Internacional%20Managua%20-%2020%20Jul%2006.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240423010941/https://sajurin.enriquebolanos.org/docs/Inaugurar%20-%20Aeropuerto%20Internacional%20Managua%20-%2020%20Jul%2006.pdf |archive-date=2024-04-23 |access-date=2024-04-22 |website=PALABRAS DEL PRESIDENTE DE LA REPÚBLICA |via=Sajurin - Buscador Biblioteca Enrique Bolaños}}</ref> The airport was remodeled by architect Roberto Sansón<ref>[http://consovipe.com/gerenciadeconstruccion-aeropuerto.html REMODELACIÓN Y AMPLIACIÓN DEL AEROPUERTO INTERNACIONAL DE MANAGUA, II, III Y IV ETAPA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813225833/https://consovipe.com/gerenciadeconstruccion-aeropuerto.html |date=2011-08-13 }}</ref> and has now been converted into one of the region's most modern airports. The airport used to serve as the hub for the [[Nicaragüense de Aviación|Nicaragüenses de Aviación]] airline, which was bought by [[TACA Airlines]] the [[El Salvador]] national airline, that bought all of the airlines in Central America.

The airport, known as Aeropuerto Sandino or MGA to locals, serves as the primary hub for connections at both domestic and international levels. [[TACA Regional]] member [[La Costeña (airline)|La Costeña]] operates flights to local destinations like [[Bluefields]], the [[Corn Islands]] and [[San Carlos, Nicaragua|San Carlos]] among others. The airport is located near the northern highway and is about {{convert|11|km|mi|sp=us}} east of the city's downtown. Out of the country's one hundred and forty airports, it is the only one with the appropriate infrastructure and capacity to handle international flights.

===Buses===
[[File:Avenida Bolivar A Chavez.jpg|thumb|right|Avenida Bolivar a Chávez]]
There are 36 bus routes in Managua.{{cn|date=May 2022}} These are regulated by the city's regulatory entity for municipal transports (IRTRAMMA) and individually operated by cooperatives and private companies. In addition there are two bus routes that formerly connected to outside parts of Managua, but these became now are part of the city (Esquipulas and Los Vanegas). And seven bus routes connect to the nearby Ciudad Sandino. Buses are the most economical way to get around the city and thus contributes to high numbers of ridership. Managua's prime location between the Northern Pan-American highway and the Southern Highway make it an ideal hub for local, national and international buses.

A transport map<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rutas.mapanica.net/mapa |title=Rutas de Managua y Ciudad Sandino |publisher=MapaNica.net – OpenStreetMap Nicaragua |access-date=2016-02-09}}</ref> of the city's 44 bus routes was created in 2016 in a [[crowdsourcing]] initiative by the Nicaraguan [[OpenStreetMap]] community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://confidencial.com.ni/the-true-geographers-take-the-buses/ |title=The true geographers take the bus |date=2 February 2016 |publisher=confidencial.com.ni |access-date=2016-02-09}}</ref>

Most bus coaches in Managua are fabricated by [[DINA S.A.]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]]. One out of every ten buses now grants access to [[wheelchair]] passengers, granting disabled passengers for the first time the ability to utilize public transportation resources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.therealnicaragua.com/vb/forums/showthread.php/3025-New-Buses-for-Managua?3025-New-Buses-for-Managua=&p=16363&viewfull=1 |title=New Buses for Managua |publisher=Therealnicaragua.com |access-date=2011-09-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717023624/http://www.therealnicaragua.com/vb/forums/showthread.php/3025-New-Buses-for-Managua?3025-New-Buses-for-Managua=&p=16363&viewfull=1 |archive-date=2011-07-17 }}</ref>

''TransNica'' is a Nicaraguan bus company that operates international bus services throughout Central America. It competes extensively with its counterpart, ''TicaBus'', a Costa Rican bus company. Managua serves as the company's hub, with buses departing from Managua to [[San José, Costa Rica]], [[Tegucigalpa]], [[San Salvador]] and [[Choluteca, Choluteca|Choluteca]].

===Rail===
{{Main|History of rail transport in Nicaragua}}
There are no railroads that operate in Managua or in Nicaragua. The country's railroads fell into disrepair during the 1980s. The [[Violeta Chamorro|Chamorro]] government closed the system and sold the cars and rails for scrap.{{cn|date=November 2021}}

===Metro===

The President of Nicaragua, [[Daniel Ortega]], was presented with a plan to revitalize the city center. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} The project included the possibility of building a [[rapid transit|metro]] that would cross over the old center of the capital that remains rather unchanged since the 1972 earthquake. The metro would serve important locales, such as the [[Augusto C. Sandino International Airport]] and continue service to Ciudad Sandino. The project costs $100 million and has been considered as a possibility for the nation's capital.{{cn|date=February 2022}}
