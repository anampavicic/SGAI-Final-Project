==Etymology==
Imphal is derived from two words: ''"Yum"'' meaning house and ''"Phal"'' meaning "plenty" or "beautiful". In old Manipuri language, ''"yum"'' is also spelt as ''"im".'' Even today, Imphal is occasionally pronounced as ''"yum-phal."''<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of Imphal East District {{!}} IMPHAL EAST DISTRICT, GOVERNMENT OF MANIPUR {{!}} India |url=https://imphaleast.nic.in/history/ |access-date=3 October 2023 |language=en-US}}</ref>

==History==

{{see also|History of Manipur}}
Initially ruled by King Khaba, Imphal was later ruled by the [[Pakhangba]] leaders. The clan of the [[Ningthouja]] tribe originated then. The Ningthouja tribe quickly expanded and dominated the region in politics and war. [[Kangla Palace]] was built by King Khagemba and his son Khunjaoba. The palace was later destroyed by the British during the [[Anglo-Manipur War]]. During the reign of Maharaja Bhagyachandra, there were a number of Burmese invasions. However, the kingdom survived with the help of Maharaj [[Gambhir Singh]].

Imphal remained peaceful until 1891, when there were internal differences in the royal family. The British sent J.W. Quinton to help but the situation only grew worse and Senapati [[Tikendrajit Singh|Tikendrajit]] was hanged. The autocratic British behaviour made people angry. This resulted in the 1891 [[Anglo-Manipur War]], which the British won.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iloveindia.com/travel/imphal/history-of-imphal.html|title=History of Imphal - Imphal History|website=iloveindia.com|access-date=22 February 2020|archive-date=22 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200222111052/https://www.iloveindia.com/travel/imphal/history-of-imphal.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Battle of Imphal]] took place between March and July 1944, during [[World War II]]. The Japanese had invaded Imphal to destroy Allied forces and then invade India, but they were defeated and forced to retreat. The attack made the British realise the militarily strategic position of Imphal.<ref>{{cite web |title=Imphal and Kohima |url=http://www.nam.ac.uk/exhibitions/online-exhibitions/britains-greatest-battles/imphal-kohima |work=Britain's Greatest Battles |publisher=[[National Army Museum]] |access-date=9 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207003427/http://www.nam.ac.uk/exhibitions/online-exhibitions/britains-greatest-battles/imphal-kohima|archive-date=7 February 2015}}</ref>

According to Census 2011, Imphal constitutes 42.13% of the total urban population in Manipur. Hence, the history of urban local governance is longer in Imphal than in other parts of the state. The British established the Town Fund Board in Imphal in 1915, which was headed by the then [[Agencies of British India|Political Agent]] Lt. Col. H.W.G.
