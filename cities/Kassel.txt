'''Kassel''' ({{IPA|de|ˈkasl̩|-|De-Kassel.ogg}}; in Germany, spelled '''Cassel''' until 1926<ref>{{Cite web|title=Von Cassel zu Kassel|url=https://www.kassel.de/buerger/stadtgeschichte/lokales/von-cassel-zu-kassel.php|access-date=2020-10-09|website=kassel.de: Der offizielle Internetauftritt der Stadt Kassel|language=de}}</ref>) is a city on the [[Fulda River]] in [[North Hesse|northern]] [[Hesse]], in [[Central Germany (geography)|central]] Germany. It is the administrative seat of the [[Regierungsbezirk]] [[Kassel (region)|Kassel]] and the district [[Kassel (district)|of the same name]], and had 201,048 inhabitants in December 2020. The former capital of the [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Hesse-Kassel]], it has many palaces and parks, including the [[Bergpark Wilhelmshöhe]], which is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Kassel is also known for the ''[[documenta]]'' [[Art exhibition|exhibitions]] of [[contemporary art]]. Kassel has a [[Public university|public]] [[University of Kassel|university]] with 25,000 students (2018) and a multicultural population (39% of the citizens in 2017 had a migration background).

== History ==
{{see also|Timeline of Kassel}}
[[File:Ansicht Kassel (Braun Hogenberg) 1572.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Kassel, 16th century]]
[[File:Kassel-merian.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A map of Kassel in 1648]]
[[File:KasselObereKoenigsstrasse2347.jpg|thumb|Königsstrasse, the main shopping street]]

Kassel was first mentioned in 913 AD, as the place where two [[deed]]s were signed by King [[Conrad of Franconia|Conrad I]]. The place was called ''Chasella'' or ''Chassalla'' and was a fortification at a bridge crossing the [[Fulda (river)|Fulda river]]. There are several yet unproven assumptions about the name's origin. It could be derived from the ancient ''Castellum Cattorum'', a castle of the Chatti, a German tribe that had lived in the area since Roman times. Another assumption is a portmanteau from Frankonian ''cas'', meaning "valley or recess", and ''sali'' meaning "hall or service building", which can be interpreted as "(town) hall in a valley".

A deed from 1189 certifies that Cassel had city rights, but the date when they were granted is not known.

The first castle in Kassel was constructed in 1277, which was later replaced by a Renaissance castle, the [[Stadtschloss Kassel|Kassel City Palace]], which burned down in 1811.

In 1567 the [[Landgraviate of Hesse]], until then centered in [[Marburg]], was divided among four sons, with [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel) becoming one of its successor states. Kassel was its capital and became a centre of [[Calvinist]] Protestantism in Germany. Strong fortifications were built to protect the [[Protestant]] stronghold against Catholic enemies. Secret societies, such as [[Rosicrucianism]] flourished, with Christian Rosenkreutz's work ''[[Fama Fraternitatis]]'' first published in 1617. In 1685, Kassel became a refuge for 1,700 [[Huguenot]]s who found shelter in the newly established borough of Oberneustadt. [[Charles I, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel|Landgrave Charles]], who was responsible for this humanitarian act, also ordered the construction of the ''Oktogon'' ([[Hercules monument (Kassel)|Hercules monument]]) and of the ''[[Orangerie (Kassel)|Orangerie]]''. In the late 18th Century, Hesse-Kassel became infamous for selling mercenaries ([[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessians]]) to the British crown to help suppress the [[American Revolution]] and to finance the construction of palaces and the Landgrave's opulent lifestyle.

In the early 19th century, the [[Brothers Grimm]] lived in Kassel. They collected and wrote most of their [[fairy tales]] there. At that time, around 1803, the Landgraviate was elevated to a Principality and its ruler to ''[[Prince-elector]]''. Shortly after, it was annexed by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and in 1807 it became the capital of the short-lived [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] under Napoleon's brother [[Jérôme Bonaparte|Jérôme]]. The Electorate was restored in 1813.

Having sided with Austria in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] to gain supremacy in Germany, the principality was annexed by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] in 1866. The Prussian administration united [[Nassau (duchy)|Nassau]], Frankfurt and Hesse-Kassel into the new Prussian province of [[Hesse-Nassau]]. Kassel ceased to be a princely residence but soon developed into a major industrial centre, as well as a major railway junction. [[Henschel & Son]], the largest railway [[locomotive]] manufacturer in Germany at the end of the nineteenth century, was based in Kassel.

In 1870, after the [[Battle of Sedan]], [[Napoleon III]] was sent as a prisoner to the [[Wilhelmshöhe Palace]] above the city. During World War I the German military headquarters were located in the Wilhelmshöhe Palace. In the late 1930s, Nazis destroyed [[Heinrich Hübsch]]'s [[Kassel Synagogue]].

During World War II Kassel was the headquarters for Germany's [[Wehrkreis]] IX, and a local subcamp of [[Dachau concentration camp]] provided [[forced labour]] for the [[Bombing of Kassel in World War II|Henschel facilities]], which included tank production plants.<ref>Edward Victor.

The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Kassel at the beginning of April 1945. The US 80th Infantry Division [[Battle of Kassel (1945)|captured Kassel]] in bitter house-to-house fighting during 1–4 April 1945, which included numerous German panzer-grenadier counterattacks, and resulted in further widespread devastation to bombed and unbombed structures alike.<ref>Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939–1946'', Stackpole Books (Revised Edition 2006), p. 150</ref>

[[Post-war]], most of the ancient buildings in the city centre were not restored, and large parts of the inner city area were completely rebuilt in the style of the 1950s. A few historic buildings, however, such as the [[Fridericianum|Museum Fridericianum]] (see below), were restored. In 1949, the interim parliament ("[[Parlamentarischer Rat]]") eliminated Kassel in the first round as a city to become the provisional capital of the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] ([[Bonn]] won).  In 1964, the town hosted the fourth ''[[Hessentag]]'' state festival (again in 2013). In 1972 the Chancellor of West Germany [[Willy Brandt]] and the prime minister of the German Democratic Republic [[Willy Stoph]] met in Wilhelmshöhe Palace for negotiations between the two German states. In 1991, the central rail station moved from "Hauptbahnhof" (''main station'') (today only used for regional trains) to "Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe". The city had a dynamic economic and social development in the recent years, reducing the unemployment rate by half and attracting many new citizens so that the population has grown constantly.

== Economy ==
Several international operating companies have factories or headquarters in the city (Volkswagen, Mercedes Benz, SMA, Wintershall, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, Rheinmetall, Bombardier). The city is home of several hospitals; the public Klinikum Kassel is one of the largest hospitals in the federal state, offering a wide range of health services.

==Geography==
Kassel is the largest city in the north of the [[federated state]] of Hesse in the south-western part of Germany, about 70 kilometers northwest of the geographic center of Germany.

It is located on both sides of the river Fulda. Kassel's deepest point is in the north-eastern Fulda valley at 132.9 m above sea level.

The urban area of Kassel is divided into 23 local districts, each of which has a local council with a local mayor as chairman. The local councils are elected every five years by the population of the local districts. The local advisory board can be heard on all important issues affecting the local district. However, the final decision on a measure rests with the Kassel city council.

===Neighboring communities===
Around Kassel is the [[Districts of Germany|administrative district]] (''[[List of rural districts of Germany|Landkreis]]'') of [[Landkreis Kassel]]. The following cities and municipalities border the city of Kassel (starting clockwise in the north): [[Ahnatal]], [[Vellmar]], [[Fuldatal]], [[Staufenberg (Reinhardswald)|Staufenberg]], [[Niestetal]], [[Kaufungen]], [[Lohfelden]], [[Fuldabrück]], [[Baunatal]], [[Schauenburg]], [[Habichtswald]]. Of these, Vellmar and Fuldatal in the north, Kaufungen in the east, Lohfelden in the southeast and Baunatal in the south are growing ever closer to the urban area.

==Culture==
[[File:Documenta IX Thomas Schütte links.jpg|thumb|Installation by Thomas Schütte on the portico of the former [[Residenzpalais (Kassel)|Residenzpalais]] during Documenta IX, 1992]]
In 1558 the first German [[observatory]] was built in Kassel, and a later version from 1714 survives as the [[Bellevue Palace, Kassel|Bellevue Palace]]. The ''Ottoneum'', the first permanent German theatre building, was built in 1604. The old building is today the Natural History Museum, and the now-called [[Staatstheater Kassel]] is located in a nearby building that was constructed in the 1950s. 
Since 1927 Kassel has been home to [[Bärenreiter]], one of the world's most important music publishers.

Since 1955 the ''[[documenta]]'', an international [[Art exhibition|exhibition]] of [[modern art|modern]] and [[contemporary art]], has been held regularly in Kassel. The ''documenta'' now takes place every five years. As a result of the ''documenta 6'' (1977), Kassel became the first town in the world to be illuminated by [[laser]] beams at night (Laserscape, by artist Horst H. Baumann). This laser installation is nowadays still visible at weekends. Artworks from former editions of the ''documenta'' (mainly sculptures) can be found in many places in Kassel; among those are the "[[7000 Oaks]]", a work of [[land art]] by the German artist [[Joseph Beuys]]. The latest/current edition of the ''documenta'', known as "''documenta 15''", runs from 18 June until 25 September 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |title=documenta fifteen |url=https://documenta-fifteen.de/en/ |access-date=2022-07-23 |website=documenta fifteen |language=en-US}}</ref>

== Climate ==
Kassel experiences an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb'') but not so far from marine climates, with a more notable [[Continental climate|continental]] influence than [[Berlin]]. Using the 1961–1990 normal and 0&nbsp;°C isotherm, the city already had a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfb'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=83401&cityname=Kassel,+Germany|title=Kassel, Germany Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2019-01-31}}</ref><ref name = noaa/>

Kassel has a population of about 200,000 and is the 3rd largest city in [[Hesse]] state and the only large city in the North Hesse region. Kassel is often called the city that located on the center of Germany, due to its position; however, the real center of Germany is not far away. Kassel first reached its first population peak of over 100,000 in 1899 and its second in 1943 with about 225,000. Kassel was destroyed during World War II and became an industrial city in 1950s. Today, Kassel is home to a few companies and universities.

The [[Bombing of Kassel in World War II|bombing raids of 1943]] destroyed 90% of the city center. The city center was almost completely rebuilt during the 1950s and is a combination of renovated or reconstructed old buildings and architecture of the 1950s. Outside the city center, the suburbs are dominated by 19th-century architecture. Timber framed old towns are situated in suburbs like Harleshausen and Bad Wilhelmshöhe. The oldest monument is the Druselturm; the Brüderkirche and the [[St Martin's Church, Kassel|Martinskirche]] are also, in part, of medieval origin. The towers of the Martinskirche are from the 1950s.

=== Churches ===

==== St. Martin, Kassel ====
The main Protestant church of Kassel, it was begun in 1364 and finished in 1462. Severely damaged by British bombing in 1943, it was later reconstructed in a more modern style between 1954 and 1958.

==== St. Bonifatius, Kassel ====
St. Bonifatius was designed and built in 1956 by [[Bieling Architekten|Josef Bieling]].

===Bergpark Wilhelmshöhe===
{{Main|Bergpark Wilhelmshöhe}}The complex includes Wilhelmshöhe Palace (with the Antiquities Collection and Old Masters), the Hercules monument, and the Lions Castle.
[[Wilhelmshöhe Palace]] above the city was built in 1786, by landgrave Wilhelm IX of Hesse-Kassel. The palace is now a museum and houses an important collection of Graeco-Roman antiques and a fine gallery of paintings comprising the second largest collection of [[Rembrandt]]s in Germany.  It is surrounded by the beautiful [[Bergpark Wilhelmshöhe]] with many appealing sights.  The complex was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1049 | title=Sites in Germany and Italy bring to 19 the number of sites inscribed on the World Heritage List this year | publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Organization | date=23 June 2013 | access-date=9 July 2013}}</ref>[[File:Wilhelmshoehe - Herkules mit Kaskaden.jpg|thumb|[[Hercules monument (Kassel)|Herkules Monument]] and water running down the cascades during the water features in the Bergpark of the [[Wilhelmshöhe Palace]]]]
[[File:Kassel asv2022-02 img07 Orangerie.jpg|thumb|The [[Orangerie (Kassel)|Orangerie]] in the [[Karlsaue]] park]]The [[Hercules monument (Kassel)|Hercules monument]] is a huge octagonal stone structure carrying a giant replica of [[Hercules|Hercules "Farnese"]] (now at Museo Archeologico Nazionale in Naples, Italy).  From its base down to Wilhelmshöhe Palace runs a long set of artificial cascades which delight visitors during the summer months. Every Sunday and Wednesday afternoon at 14:30 (from May until October) the famous [[Hercules monument (Kassel)|water features]] take place. They start at the Oktagon and during a one-hour walk through the park visitors can follow the water's way until they reach the lake of the Wilhelmshöhe Palace, where a fountain of about {{convert|50|m|ft}} marks the end of the spectacle.

The ''[[Löwenburg (Kassel)|Löwenburg]]'' ("Lions Castle") is a replica of a medieval castle, also built during the reign of Wilhelm IX. After the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–71 [[Napoléon III]] was imprisoned in Wilhelmshöhe. In 1918, Wilhelmshöhe became the seat of the German Army High Command (OHL): it was there that the military commanders [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] and [[Erich Ludendorff|Ludendorff]] prepared the German capitulation.

===Staatspark Karlsaue (Karlsaue Park)===
Another large park and also part of the [[European Garden Heritage Network]] is the [[Karlsaue]] along the Fulda River.

In [[1996–97 DEL season|1997]], they were runners-up in the championship playoffs, losing to [[Adler Mannheim]], and reached the semi-finals on three more occasions. The Huskies ran into financial difficulties and dissolved in 2010.<ref name="DW1"/> The "Young Huskies", which is a junior and youth hockey club, decided to enter a men's team in the Hessenliga.<ref name="DW1"/> This is the fifth division and the lowest men's competition in the state of [[Hesse]].<ref name="DW1"/> The new club was expecting no more than 3,000 supporters for the first home game in the Hessenliga.<ref name="DW1"/> However, they had over 5,000 supporters come to watch.<ref name="DW1"/>

[[File:Kassel asv2022-02 img46 Wilhelmshöhe tram station.jpg|thumb|A [[Trams in Kassel|tram in Kassel]]]]

Kassel has [[Trams in Kassel|seven tram lines]] (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), with trams arriving usually every 15 minutes. The city also operates a light rail [[Stadtbahn]] network called ''[[Kassel RegioTram|RegioTram]]'' using [[Regio Citadis]] low-floor trams which run on both tram and main line railway tracks with three lines (RT1, RT4, RT5). Moreover, a number of low-floor buses complete the Kassel public transport system. The introduction of low-floor buses led to the development of the [[Kassel kerb]] which improves the [[accessibility]] at bus stops.

The city is connected to the [[Deutsche Bahn|national rail network]] at two stations, [[Kassel Hauptbahnhof|Kassel Central]], and [[Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe railway station|Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe]]. The traditional central station (Hauptbahnhof) has been reduced to the status of a regional station since the opening of the [[Hanover-Würzburg high-speed rail line]] in 1991 and its station (Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe) on the high-speed line at which the [[InterCityExpress]] (ICE) and [[InterCity]] services call as well as [[Nightjet]] and [[Flixtrain]].

Kassel is connected to the motorways [[Bundesautobahn 7|A 7]], [[Bundesautobahn 49|A 49]] and [[Bundesautobahn 44|A 44]].

The city is served by [[Kassel Calden Airport]].
