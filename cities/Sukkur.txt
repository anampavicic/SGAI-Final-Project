'''Sukkur''' ({{Langx|sd|{{Naskh|سکر}}}}; {{Langx|ur|{{nq|سكھر}}}}) is a city in the [[Pakistan]]i province of [[Sindh]] along the western bank of the [[Indus River]], directly across from the historic city of [[Rohri]]. Sukkur is the [[List of cities in Sindh by population|third largest city]] in [[Sindh]] after [[Karachi]] and [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]], and [[List of most populous cities in Pakistan|14th largest city of Pakistan]] by population.<ref name="Population city">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tageo.com/index-e-pk-cities-PK.htm|title=Pakistan City & Town Population List|access-date=4 December 2021|publisher=Tageo.com website}}</ref><ref name="citypopulation.de">{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Pakistan-100T.html|title=Pakistan: Provinces and Major Cities – Population Statistics, Maps, Charts, Weather and Web Information|website=citypopulation.de|access-date=4 December 2021}}</ref> The city was originally founded by the [[Rai dynasty]] of Sindh.

== Etymology ==
The name Sukkur is derived from the [[Sindhi language]] word '''''sakhar''''' meaning ''''''superior''''''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Everett-Heath |first1=John |title=Sukkur |journal=Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Place Names |date=22 October 2020 |doi=10.1093/acref/9780191905636.001.0001/acref-9780191905636-e-11213 |url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191905636.001.0001/acref-9780191905636-e-11213 |publisher=Oxford University Press |language=en}}</ref>

== History ==
The region around Sukkur has been inhabited for millennia. The ruins of [[Lakhueen-jo-daro|Lakhan-jo-daro]], located near an industrial park on the outskirts of Sukkur,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hyder|first1=Ali|title=Brief Description of Archaeological Sites and Monuments of Sindh |url=https://www.academia.edu/11300512|access-date=19 December 2017|via=Academia.edu}}</ref> date from the [[Indus Valley civilisation#Mature Harappan|Mature Harappan]] period of the [[Indus Valley civilisation|Indus Valley Civilization]], between 2600 BCE and 1900 BCE covers more than 300 Hectares of area and is touted to be second largest city of the Indus Valley Civilization just 75 Kilometers away from another major city of [[Indus Valley Civilization]], [[Mohenjo-daro|Mohenjo Daro]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Collecting samples from a Lakhueen-jo-daro trial trench |url=http://ancient.sindh.ws/hphs/15.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422174251/http://ancient.sindh.ws/hphs/15.htm|archive-date=2008-04-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>

By the 12th Century [[Rohri]] and Sukkur had been incorporated in dominion of the [[Bhati]] Rajputs.<ref name=TK>{{Cite book|last=Kothiyal|first=Tanuja|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=be-7CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA56|title=Nomadic Narratives: A History of Mobility and Identity in the Great Indian|publisher=Cambridgre University Press|year=2016|isbn=9781107080317|page=72}}</ref> 
[[File:Temple Sadh Belo.jpg|thumb|left|Sukkur is home of the Hindu [[Sadh Belo]] shrine.]]

"Old Sukkur" was initially a small village prior to the establishment of a military garrison in 1839. Sukkur was built on a low limestone ridge on the banks of the [[Indus River]].<ref name="ross">{{cite book |last1=Ross |first1=David|title=The land of the five rivers and Sindh|date=1883|publisher=Chapman and Hall|url=https://archive.org/details/landfiveriversa00rossgoog|quote=sukkur.|access-date=19 December 2017}}</ref> The city was once surrounded by groves of [[date palm]]s that were traditionally believed to have grown from the discarded date-pits from Arab invaders in the 8th century.<ref name="ross" />

[[File:Mir Masum's Minar and tomb 3.jpg|thumb|left|Sukkur's Shrine of [[Masum Shah]] and adjacent minaret dates from 1607.]]
The village of Sukkur was directly across from the larger town of [[Rohri]], which served as a busy port along the Indus by the 1200s, and was a major trading centre for agricultural produce.<ref name=bowden/> An {{Convert|86|foot|m|abbr=}} tall minaret was built at Sukkur's shrine of Mir [[Masum Shah]] in 1607.<ref name="ross"/>

Modern Sukkur, or '''New Sukkur''', was built during British rule alongside what was once a small village directly across from the historic city of [[Rohri]]. The British established a military garrison here in 1839,<ref name=william/> which was abandoned in 1845, though Sukkur continued to grow in importance as a trading center.<ref name=william>{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=Albert William|title=A Gazetteer of the Province of Sind|publisher=G.

Completed in 1889, Sukkur's [[Lansdowne Bridge Rohri|Lansdowne Bridge]] connects the Sukkur to [[Rohri]] across the Indus, and was one of the first bridges to cross the river. The bridge made the journey between [[Karachi]] and [[Multan]] easier. The bridge was built with two large pylons rather than a series of pillars extending across the river – a cutting-edge design for such an expansive span.<ref name="sukk">{{cite web|title=History of Sukkur|url=http://oldsukkur.org/history_of_sukkur|website=Old Sukkur|publisher=Sindhi Association of India|access-date=5 December 2021}}</ref> The bridge was also made of metal, and features an unusual design.

[[Sukkur Barrage]] (formerly called Lloyd Barrage), built under the [[British Raj]] on the [[Indus River]], controls one of the largest irrigation systems in the world. It was designed by Sir Arnold Musto KCIE, and constructed under the overall direction of [[Sir Charlton Harrison]] between 1923 and 1932. The {{convert|5001|ft|m}} long barrage is made of yellow stone and steel and can water nearly 10 million acres (40,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of farmland through its seven large canals.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.dawn.com/news/1029295|title = Rule violations threaten Sukkur Barrage|date = 16 July 2013|access-date =4 December 2021|work=Dawn|location=Pakistan|last = Kiani|first = Khaleeq}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hpsukkur.brinkster.net/barrage.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330232609/http://hpsukkur.brinkster.net/barrage.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-03-30 |title=Sukkur Barrage |website=Brinkster.net website|access-date=4 December 2021}}</ref>

On the eve of the [[Partition of British India]] in 1947, Sukkur's old town was home to about 10,000 residents, while New Sukkur was home to 80,000.<ref name="sukk"/>

===Modern===
After the [[Partition of India|formation]] of [[Pakistan]] most of the city's Hindu population migrated to India, though like much of Sindh, Sukkur did not experience the widespread rioting that occurred in Punjab and Bengal.<ref name=kumar>{{cite journal|last1=Kumar|first1=Priya|title=Sindh, 1947 and Beyond|journal=South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies|volume=39|issue=4|date=2 December 2016|pages=773–789 |doi=10.1080/00856401.2016.1244752|doi-access=free}}</ref> According to the [[1941 Census of India|1941 census]], about 70% of the population of Sukkur was Hindu, this number decreased to 2% by the [[1951 Census of Pakistan|1951 census]] as a result of the partition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/ideologie/data/CensusIndia/CensusIndia1941/Census%20of%20India%201941.pdf|title=INDIA – Part I – Tables|work=[[1941 Census of India|Census of India 1941]]|page=90|access-date=27 April 2022|archive-date=15 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210815164109/http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/ideologie/data/CensusIndia/CensusIndia1941/Census%20of%20India%201941.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://lsi.gov.in:8081/jspui/bitstream/123456789/7452/1/1422_1951_POP.pdf |title=Population According to Religion|work=[[1951 Census of Pakistan|Census of Pakistan, 1951]] |pages=8, 22}}</ref> However, less than 500 Hindus were killed in all of Sindh between 1947 and 1948 as Sindhi Muslims largely resisted calls to turn against their Hindu neighbours.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chitkara|first1=M.

The Sindh Industrial Trading Estate in Sukkur was established in 1950. The [[Ayub Bridge]] was built in 1962, and spans the Indus River alongside the British-era Landsdowne Bridge. The city suffered major flooding during the [[2010 Pakistan floods]] which inundated large parts of the city.

==Climate==
Sukkur has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh''), characterised by extremely hot and hazy summers with mild and foggy winters. Sukkur is known for its extremely hot summers, and was described as the hottest city in [[British India]].<ref name=william/> Wind speed is low throughout the year, and sunshine is abundant. Summer temperatures regularly surpass {{convert|50|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Dry heat is experienced starting April to early June until the [[Monsoon]] season starts to arrive. Monsoons in Sukkur are not very wet, but bring high [[dew point]]s, resulting in high heat indices. Monsoons recede by September, but it is not until late October that the short lived autumn season is experienced before the onset of the region's cool winters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/OPSK/date/2013-7-6?mr=1|title=Sukkur, Pakistan History|website=Weather Underground}}</ref> The average annual rainfall of Sukkur is {{cvt|159.6|mm}} and mainly occurs in the monsoon season. The highest annual rainfall ever is {{cvt|698|mm}}, recorded in 2022 and the lowest annual rainfall ever is 0&nbsp;mm in 1941.

Roughly 96% of the city is Muslim, while the remaining 4% comprise other minorities, overwhelmingly Hindus.

==Economy==
Sukkur's economy is largely reliant upon the agricultural produce from northern Sindh's farms, and serves as a trading and processing center for agricultural goods.<ref name=bowden>{{cite book |last1=Bowden |first1=Rob |title=Settlements of the Indus River|date=2004|publisher=Heinemann-Raintree Library|isbn=978-1403457189|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N3JKeIBYmoMC&q=sukkur+established+by+british |access-date=5 December 2021}}</ref> The city also once had a bustling shipbuilding industry.<ref name="sukk"/>

Sukkur is well-connected to the rest of Pakistan by road and rail, which in turn has attracted new industries such as chemical manufacturing, metalworking, and cement manufacturing.<ref name=bowden/>

===Agriculture===
Sukkur had a large fertile and cultivable land area. During ''kharif'', rice, bajra, cotton, tomatoes and peas are cultivated; whereas during ''rabi'' the main crops are wheat, barley, graham and melons. Sukkur is famous, world over, for its dates. Sukkur also has a large Riveraine forest along the course of the Indus. These tropical forests are found within the protective embankments on either side of the Indus. During 1997–98 the total area under forests was {{cvt|510|km2}} which yielded {{convert|55000|ft3|m3}} of timber and {{convert|27000|ft3|m3}} of [[firewood]] besides other mine products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.findpk.com/cities/Explorer-pakistan-Sukkur.html |title=Explore Pakistan |access-date=18 September 2014 |website=findpk.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708074930/http://findpk.com/cities/Explorer-pakistan-Sukkur.html |archive-date=8 July 2014 }}</ref>
