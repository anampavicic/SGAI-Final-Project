'''Portsmouth''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Portsmouth.ogg|ˈ|p|ɔr|t|s|m|ə|θ}} {{respell|PORTS|məth}}) is a [[port]] [[city status in the United Kingdom|city]] and [[unitary authority]] in [[Hampshire]], England. Most of Portsmouth is located on [[Portsea Island]], off the south coast of England in the [[Solent]], making Portsmouth the only city in England not located primarily on the [[Great Britain|mainland]]. The city is located {{convert|22|mi}} south-east of [[Southampton]], {{convert|50|mi}} west of [[Brighton and Hove]] and {{convert|74|mi}} south-west of [[London]].  With a population last recorded at 208,100, it is the most densely-populated city in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/censuspopulationchange/E06000044/|title=How the population changed in Portsmouth, Census 2021 - ONS|website=www.ons.gov.uk}}</ref> Portsmouth forms part of the [[South Hampshire]] urban area with [[Gosport]], [[Borough of Fareham|Fareham]], [[Borough of Havant|Havant]], [[Borough of Eastleigh|Eastleigh]] and Southampton.

Portsmouth's history can be traced to [[Roman Britain|Roman times]] and has been a significant Royal Navy dockyard and base for centuries. Portsmouth was founded {{Circa|1180}} by Anglo-Norman merchant [[Jean de Gisors]] in the south-west area of Portsea Island, a location now known as [[Old Portsmouth]].<ref name="portsmouth-guide_co_uk">{{cite web | url=http://www.portsmouth-guide.co.uk/local_f/history/history3.htm | title=The History of Portsmouth 1164AD - 1417AD }}</ref> Around this time, de Gisors ordered the construction of a chapel dedicated to [[Thomas Becket|St Thomas Becket]].<ref name="portsmouth-guide_co_uk" /> This became a parish church by the 14th century. Portsmouth was established as a town with a royal charter on 2 May 1194.<ref name=history3/>{{sfn|Quail|1994|pp=14–18}} The city is home to the first drydock ever built. It was constructed by [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] in 1496.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://portsmouthdockyard.org.uk/timeline/details/1495-worlds-first-dry-dock | title=1495 - Worlds First Dry Dock - Portsmouth Royal Dockyard Historical Trust }}</ref>

Portsmouth has the world's oldest [[dry dock]], ''"The Great Stone Dock"''; originally built in 1698, rebuilt in 1769 and presently known as "No.5 Dock".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://portsmouthdockyard.org.uk/Page%206.htm |title=Portsmouth Royal Dockyard History |publisher=Portsmouthdockyard.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2022-06-08}}</ref> The world's first mass [[production line]] was established at the naval base's [[Portsmouth Block Mills|Block Mills]] which produced pulley blocks for the [[Royal Navy]] fleet. By the early-19th century, Portsmouth was the most heavily [[Fortification|fortified]] city in the world, and was considered "the world's greatest naval port" at the height of the [[British Empire]] throughout ''[[Pax Britannica]]''. By 1859, a ring of defensive land and sea forts, known as the [[Palmerston Forts, Portsmouth|Palmerston Forts]], had been built around Portsmouth in anticipation of an invasion from continental Europe.

In the 20th century, Portsmouth achieved [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] on 21 April 1926.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://portsmouthdockyard.org.uk/timeline/details/1926-portsmouth-created-a-city |title=1926 – Portsmouth Created a City – Portsmouth Royal Dockyard Historical Trust |publisher=Portsmouthdockyard.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2022-06-08}}</ref> During the [[Second World War]], the city was a pivotal embarkation point for the [[D-Day landings]] and was bombed extensively in the [[Portsmouth Blitz]], which resulted in the deaths of 930 people. In 1982, a large Royal Navy task force departed from Portsmouth for the [[Falklands War]]. [[HMY Britannia|Her Majesty's Yacht ''Britannia'']] was formerly based in Portsmouth and oversaw the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|transfer of Hong Kong]] in 1997, after which ''Britannia'' was retired from royal service, decommissioned and relocated to [[Leith]] as a museum ship.

[[HMNB Portsmouth]] is an operational Royal Navy base and is home to two-thirds of the UK's surface fleet. The base has long been nicknamed '''Pompey''', a nickname it shares with the wider city of Portsmouth and [[Portsmouth Football Club]]. The naval base also contains the [[National Museum of the Royal Navy]] and [[Portsmouth Historic Dockyard]]; which has a collection of historic warships, including the ''Mary Rose'', [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]]'s flagship, {{HMS|Victory}} (the world's oldest naval ship still in commission), and {{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}}, the Royal Navy's first [[ironclad warship]].

The former {{HMS|Vernon|shore establishment|6}} shore establishment has been redeveloped into a large retail [[Outlet store|outlet]] destination known as [[Gunwharf Quays]] which opened in 2001.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/new-era-dawns-portsmouth-gunwharf-quays-opens-1267913 |title=New era dawns for Portsmouth as Gunwharf quays opens |newspaper=[[The News (Portsmouth)|The News]] |date=15 February 2016 |location=Portsmouth}}</ref> Portsmouth is among the few British cities with two cathedrals: the [[Portsmouth Cathedral|Anglican Cathedral of St Thomas]] and the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Cathedral of St John the Evangelist, Portsmouth|Cathedral of St John the Evangelist]]. The waterfront and [[Portsmouth Harbour]] are dominated by the [[Spinnaker Tower]], one of the [[List of tallest structures in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom's tallest structures]] at {{convert|560|feet}}.

[[Southsea]] is Portsmouth's [[British coastal resort|seaside resort]], which was named after Southsea Castle. Southsea has two piers; [[Clarence Pier]] amusement park and [[South Parade Pier]]. The world's only regular hovercraft service operates from [[Southsea Hoverport]] to [[Ryde]] on the [[Isle of Wight]]. [[Southsea Common]] is a large open-air public recreation space which serves as a venue for a wide variety of annual events.

The city has several mainline railway stations that connect to [[London Victoria railway station|London Victoria]] and [[London Waterloo railway station|London Waterloo]] amongst other lines in southern England. [[Portsmouth International Port]] is a commercial cruise ship and ferry port for international destinations. The port is the second busiest in the United Kingdom after [[Port of Dover|Dover]], handling around three million passengers a year. The city formerly had its own airport, [[Portsmouth Airport (Hampshire)|Portsmouth Airport]], until its closure in 1973. The [[University of Portsmouth]] enrolls 23,000 students.

Portsmouth is the birthplace of notable people such as author [[Charles Dickens]], engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], former Prime Minister [[James Callaghan]], actor [[Peter Sellers]] and author-journalist [[Christopher Hitchens]].

England's southern coast was vulnerable to [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danish Viking]] invasions during the eighth and ninth centuries, and was conquered by Danish pirates in 787.{{sfn|Allen|2015|p=26}} In 838, during the reign of [[Æthelwulf, King of Wessex]], a Danish fleet landed between Portsmouth and Southampton and plundered the region.{{sfn|Allen|2015|p=27}} Æthelwulf sent Wulfherd and the governor of [[Dorset]]shire to confront the Danes at Portsmouth, where most of their ships were docked. Although the Danes were driven off, Wulfherd was killed.{{sfn|Allen|2015|p=27}} The Danes returned in 1001 and pillaged Portsmouth and the surrounding area, threatening the English with extinction.{{sfn|Allen|2015|p=29}}{{sfn|Allen|2015|p=30}} They were massacred by the English survivors the following year; rebuilding began, although the town experienced further attacks until [[Battle of Stamford Bridge|1066]].{{sfn|Allen|2015|p=31}}

King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] died in 1189; his son, [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] (who had spent most of his life in France), arrived in Portsmouth en route to his coronation in London.{{sfn|Allen|2015|p=32}} When Richard returned from captivity in [[Duchy of Austria|Austria]] in May 1194, he summoned an army and a fleet of 100 ships to the port.{{sfn|Allen|2015|p=33}} Richard gave Portsmouth market-town status with a royal charter on 2 May, authorising an annual fifteen-day free-market fair, weekly markets and a local court to deal with minor matters, and exempted its inhabitants from an £18 annual tax.<ref name=history3/>{{sfn|Quail|1994|pp=14–18}} The 1194 royal charter's 800th anniversary was celebrated in 1994 with ceremonies at the city museum.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Portsmouth 800 |url=https://www.portsmouth-guide.co.uk/local/port800.htm |access-date=2024-05-26 |website=www.portsmouth-guide.co.uk}}</ref>

[[John, King of England|King John]] reaffirmed Richard{{nbsp}}I's rights and privileges, and established a permanent naval base. The first docks were begun by [[William of Wrotham]] in 1212,<ref name=history3/>{{sfn|Allen|2015|p=33}} and John summoned his earls, barons, and military advisers to plan an invasion of [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]].{{sfn|Allen|2015|p=34}} In 1229, declaring war against France, [[Henry III of England|Henry{{nbsp}}III]] assembled a force described by historian Lake Allen as "one of the finest armies that had ever been raised in England".{{sfn|Allen|2015|p=36}} The invasion stalled, and returned from France in October 1231.{{sfn|Allen|2015|p=37}} Henry{{nbsp}}III summoned troops to invade [[Guienne]] in 1242, and [[Edward I of England|Edward{{nbsp}}I]] sent supplies for his army in France in 1295.{{sfn|Allen|2015|pp=37, 39}} Commercial interests had grown by the following century, and its exports included wool, corn, grain, and livestock.{{sfn|Allen|2015|p=43}}

[[Edward II of England|Edward II]] ordered all ports on the south coast to assemble their largest vessels at Portsmouth to carry soldiers and horses to the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]] in 1324 to strengthen defences.{{sfn|Allen|2015|p=44}} A French fleet commanded by [[David II of Scotland]] attacked in the [[English Channel]], ransacked the [[Isle of Wight]] and threatened the town.

[[Henry V of England|Henry V]] gathered his forces in Portsmouth for an invasion of France in 1415, it was while staying at Portchester Castle that the Southampton plot was uncovered.

In 1416, a number of French ships blockaded the town (which housed ships which were set to invade Normandy); Henry gathered a fleet at Southampton, and invaded the Norman coast in August that year.{{sfn|Allen|2015|p=49}} Recognising the town's growing importance, he ordered a wooden [[Round Tower (Portsmouth)|Round Tower]] to be built at the mouth of the harbour; it was completed in 1426.{{sfn|Hewitt|2013|p=27}} [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] rebuilt the fortifications with stone, assisted Robert Brygandine and Sir [[Reginald Bray]] in the construction of the world's first [[dry dock]],{{sfn|Hewitt|2013|p=33}} and raised the [[Square Tower]] in 1494.{{sfn|Hewitt|2013|p=27}} He made Portsmouth a Royal Dockyard, England's only dockyard considered "national".{{sfn|Allen|2015|p=53}} Although [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]] may have used Portsmouth to build ships as early as the ninth century, the first warship recorded as constructed in the town was the [[Sweepstake (warship)|''Sweepstake'']] (built in 1497).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-24836582 |title=Portsmouth's long shipbuilding history comes to an end |access-date=9 November 2013 |publisher=BBC |date=6 November 2013}}</ref>

Shipbuilding jobs fell from 46&nbsp;per cent of the workforce in 1951 to 14 per cent in 1966, drastically reducing manpower in the dockyard. The city council attempted to create new work; an industrial estate was built in Fratton in 1948, and others were built at Paulsgrove and Farlington during the 1950s and 1960s.<ref name="history2"/> Although traditional industries such as brewing and corset manufacturing disappeared during this time, electrical engineering became a major employer. Despite the cutbacks in traditional sectors, Portsmouth remained attractive to industry. [[Zurich Insurance Group]] moved their UK headquarters to the city in 1968, and [[IBM]] relocated their European headquarters in 1979.<ref name="history2"/> Portsmouth's population had dropped from about 200,000 to 177,142 by the end of the 1960s.{{sfn|Hewitt|2013|p=161}} Defence Secretary [[John Nott]] decided in the early 1980s that of the four home dockyards, Portsmouth and [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]] would be closed. The city council won a concession, however, and the dockyard was downgraded instead to a naval base.{{sfn|Hewitt|2013|p=92}}

In 1956, the Soviet cruiser Ordzhonikidze docked in Portsmouth harbour on a diplomatic mission that had taken head of state Nikita Khrushchev and Nikolai Bulganin to Britain. Naval intelligence was interested in the design of the ship and [[MI6]] recruited diver [[Lionel Crabb]] to collect intelligence on the ship particularly its propulsion. After diving into the harbour Crabb was never seen again. This led to a diplomatic incident with the Soviet Union and scandal in British domestic politics.{{citation needed|date=April 2023}}

On 2 April 1982, Argentine forces invaded two British territories in the South Atlantic: the [[Falkland Islands]] and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]]. The British government's response was to dispatch a [[British logistics in the Falklands War|naval task force]], and the aircraft carriers {{HMS|Hermes|R12|6}} and {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}} sailed from Portsmouth for the South Atlantic on 5&nbsp;April. The successful outcome of the war reaffirmed Portsmouth's significance as a naval port and its importance to the defence of British interests.{{sfn|Hewitt|2013|p=93}} In January 1997, [[HMY Britannia|Her Majesty's Yacht ''Britannia'']] embarked from the city on her final voyage to oversee the handover of Hong Kong; for many, this marked the end of the empire.{{sfn|Brendon|2007|p=660}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Duke of Edinburgh slams move to decommission the Royal Yacht Britannia |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/duke-of-edinburgh-slams-move-to-decommission-180047 |work=Daily Mirror |access-date=20 July 2016 |date=15 May 2011}}</ref> She was decommissioned on 11 December of that year at Portsmouth Naval Base in the presence of [[Elizabeth II]], the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]], and twelve senior members of the royal family.<ref>{{cite web |title=Learn About The Decommissioning of the Royal Yacht Britannia |url=http://www.royalyachtbritannia.co.uk/about-the-royal-yacht/royal-residence/decommissioning/ |publisher=The Royal Yacht Britannia Trust |access-date=11 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Alderson |first1=Andrew |title=Queen blamed Major for royal yacht fiasco |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1427992/Queen-blamed-Major-for-royal-yacht-fiasco.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |access-date=11 August 2016 |date=20 April 2003}}</ref>

The naval shore establishment {{HMS|Vernon|shore establishment|6}} contained the Royal Navy's arsenal; weapons and ammunition which would be taken from ships at its 'Gun Wharf' as they entered the harbour, and resupplied when they headed back to sea. The 1919 ''Southsea and Portsmouth Official Guide'' described the establishment as "the finest collections of weapons outside the Tower of London, containing more than 25,000 rifles".{{sfn|Hewitt|2013|pp=185, 186}} During the early nineteenth century, the 'Gunwharf' supplied the fleet with a "grand arsenal" of cannons, mortars, bombs, and ordnance. Although gunpowder was not provided due to safety concerns, it could be obtained at Priddy's Hard (near Gosport).{{sfn|Allen|2015|p=123}} An armoury sold small arms to soldiers, and the [[stone frigate]] also had blacksmith and carpenter shops for armourers. It was run by three officers: a ''viz'' (storekeeper), a clerk, and a foreman. By 1817, Gunwharf reportedly employed 5,000 men and housed the world's largest naval arsenal.{{sfn|Allen|2015|pp=123, 124}}

Southsea is a [[seaside resort]] and residential area of Portsmouth located at the southern end of Portsea Island. Its name originates from Southsea Castle, a seafront castle built in 1544 by Henry{{nbsp}}VIII to help defend the [[Solent]] and Portsmouth Harbour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southseacastle.co.uk/tudor-castle/about-the-castle |title=About Southsea Castle' |publisher=Portsmouth Museums |date=2015 |access-date=26 March 2015 |archive-date=9 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009152010/http://southseacastle.co.uk/tudor-castle/about-the-castle |url-status=dead }}</ref> The area was developed in 1809 as Croxton Town; by the 1860s, the suburb of Southsea had expanded to provide working-class housing.<ref name="pissea"/> Southsea developed as a seaside and bathing resort.<ref name="pissea"/> A pump room and baths were built near the present-day [[Clarence Pier]], and a complex was developed which included vapour baths, showers, and card-playing and assembly rooms for holiday-goers.{{sfn|Quail|2000|pp=16–17}}

Clarence Pier, opened in 1861 by the Prince and Princess of Wales, was named after Portsmouth military governor [[Lord Frederick FitzClarence]] and was described as "one of the largest amusement parks on the south coast".{{sfn|Hewitt|2013|p=140}} [[South Parade Pier]] was built in 1878, and is among the United Kingdom's 55 remaining private piers.{{sfn|Hewitt|2013|p=138}}{{sfn|Quail|2000|p=46}} Originally a terminal for ferries travelling to the Isle of Wight, it was soon redeveloped as an entertainment centre. The pier was rebuilt after fires in 1904, 1967 and 1974 (during the filming of ''[[Tommy (1975 film)|Tommy]]'').{{sfn|Hewitt|2013|p=138}}<ref name="pissea"/> Plans were announced in 2015 for a Solent Eye at Clarence Pier: a £750,000, 24-gondola [[Ferris wheel]] similar to the [[London Eye]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/business/plan-unveiled-for-750-000-ferris-wheel-similar-to-london-eye-on-southsea-seafront-1-7079196 |title=Plan unveiled for £750,000 ferris wheel similar to London Eye on Southsea seafront |publisher=The News |access-date=1 October 2016 |archive-date=16 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516083643/http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/business/plan-unveiled-for-750-000-ferris-wheel-similar-to-london-eye-on-southsea-seafront-1-7079196 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Southsea is dominated by Southsea Common, a {{convert|480|acre|adj=on}} grassland created by draining the marshland next to the vapour baths in 1820. The common met the demands of the early-19th-century military for a clear [[Shooting range|firing range]],{{sfn|Quail|2000|p=19–20}} and parallels the shore from Clarence Pier to Southsea Castle.{{sfn|Quail|2000|p=19–20}} A popular recreation area, it hosts a number of annual events which include carnivals, Christmas markets, and Victorian festivals.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top Events for 2016 at Southsea Common |url=http://www.visitportsmouth.co.uk/inspire-me/top-events-for-2016 |website=Visit Portsmouth |publisher=Portsmouth City Council |access-date=3 August 2016}}</ref>{{sfn|Hewitt|2013|p=136}} The common has a large collection of mature [[elm]] trees, believed to be the oldest and largest surviving in Hampshire and which have escaped [[Dutch elm disease]] due to their isolation. Other plants include the [[Canary Island]] date palms (''[[Phoenix canariensis]]''), some of Britain's largest, which have recently produced viable seed.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/nostalgia/the-southsea-trees-which-escaped-disease-but-not-hurricane-1-6142130 |title=Southsea Common Trees |publisher=Portsmouth City Council |access-date=29 March 2015 |archive-date=2 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402124718/http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/nostalgia/the-southsea-trees-which-escaped-disease-but-not-hurricane-1-6142130 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Southsea is often mistaken as a town separate from Portsmouth, mainly due to the confusing [[Portsmouth & Southsea railway station]] name.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}} The resort of Southsea previously had its own dedicated light railway line; the [[Southsea Railway]] and its own terminus, [[East Southsea railway station]]. The Southsea Railway and station were closed in 1914, with the station's name merged into that of Portsmouth's main railway station name in 1925.

[[File:Portsea islandcanal1815.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A map of the planned route of Portsmouth and Arundel Canal across Portsea Island from 1815]]

The [[Portsmouth and Arundel Canal]] ran between the towns and was built in 1823 by the Portsmouth & Arundel Navigation Company. Never financially successful, and found to be contaminating Portsea Island fresh water wells,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.welcometoportsmouth.co.uk/portsmouth%20arundel%20canal.html |title=Portsmouth Canal |website=welcometoportsmouth.co.uk |access-date=26 July 2021 }}</ref> it was abandoned in 1855 and the company was wound up in 1888.{{sfn|Green |2006 | pp=18–19 }} The canal was part of a larger scheme for a secure inland canal route from London to Portsmouth, allowing boats to avoid the [[English Channel]]. It had three sections: a pair of ship canals (one on Portsea Island and one to [[Chichester]]) and a barge canal from [[Ford, West Sussex|Ford]] on the [[River Arun]] to [[Hunston, West Sussex|Hunston]], where it joined the canal's Chichester section.{{sfn|Armstrong|1971|pp=144–145}}

The route through Portsea Island began from a basin formerly located on Arundel Street and cut through [[Landport]], Fratton and [[Milton, Portsmouth|Milton]], ending at the eastern end of Locksway Road in Milton (where a set of lock gates accessed [[Langstone Harbour|Langstone]] and [[Chichester Harbour]]s. After the island route was closed, the drained canal-bed sections through Landport and Fratton were reused for the [[Portsmouth Direct line]], or filled-in to surface level to form a new main road route to Milton, named Goldsmith Avenue.

The brick-lined canal walls are clearly visible between the Fratton and Portsmouth & Southsea railway stations. The canal lock entrance at Locksway Road in Milton is east of the Thatched House [[pub]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@50.7945967,-1.0392926,182m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en|title=Google Maps|website=Google Maps}}</ref>
