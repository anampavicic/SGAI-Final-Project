It is notable for an important [[railway]] [[Junction (rail)|junction]] and is home to Baranavichy State University.

== General information ==
The city of Baranavichy is located on the Baranavichy Plain in the interfluve of [[Shchara]] and its tributary Myshanka. Baranavichy is located virtually on a straight line, connecting the regional center [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]] (206&nbsp;km) and [[Minsk]] (149&nbsp;km). Nearby cities: [[Lyakhavichy]] (17&nbsp;km), [[Slonim]] (42&nbsp;km), [[Nyasvizh]] (51&nbsp;km), [[Navahrudak]] (52&nbsp;km), and [[Hantsavichy]] (72&nbsp;km). Baranavichy is located on flat terrain where the height difference does not exceed 20 m (from 180 to 200 m above sea level). The altitude of the city is 193 m above sea level. The total length of the city is 10&nbsp;km from west to east and 7&nbsp;km from south to north. The city is somewhat extended (by 8&nbsp;km) in the southwest (from Brestskaya Street) to the northeast (to Fabrichnaya Street) and compressed (6.3&nbsp;km) in the north (Sovetskaya Street) to the southeast (Frolenkov street). The total area occupied by the city is 80.66 km<sup>2</sup>. (8066 ha as of 12 August 2012). The population density is more than 2,000 people per km<sup>2</sup>.

The northernmost point of the city is Korolik Street, located to the north of the plant Baranovichsky automatic lines at 53°10' north latitude, and the southernmost is the village of Uznogi located at 53°06' north latitude. The extreme western point is located in the vicinity of Badaka Street at 25°57' east longitude, and the extreme eastern point is located in the vicinity of the intersection of Egorov Street and Kashtanovaya Street at 26°04' east longitude. The geometric center of the city is Lenin Square. In total, the city has about five hundred streets and lanes with an overall length of 252.8&nbsp;km, 129.8&nbsp;km of which are landscaped and of which 240&nbsp;km are lit.

The city of Baranavichy is characterized by a favourable geographical position and is a major junction of the most important railways and highways. There is a close location to the main gas pipeline, a developed system of energy and water supply, and a favourable climate. A number of large industrial enterprises are located in the city.

As of 1 January 2019, 81,829 passenger cars are registered in Baranavichy. 146,678 adult residents live in the city. Thus, almost every second citizen of the city owns a passenger car.

The city of Baranavichy is not only one of the largest cities of [[Belarus]] in terms of population (eighth largest in the country) but also one of the most important industrial, cultural, and educational centers of Belarus.

At the beginning of 2010, Baranavichy had 21 sister cities, including Russian Mytishchi (Moscow Oblast), Vasileostrovsky district of St. Petersburg, Finnish Heinola, Austrian [[Stockerau]], Polish Biala Podlaska, Gdynia, Sulentsin povet, Chinese Chibi, Italian Ferrara, Latvian Jelgava, Ukrainian Poltava, Novovolynsk and others.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
In the second half of the 17th century, Baranavichy housed the Jesuit mission. In the second half of the 18th century, Baranavichy was the property of [[Massalski family|Massalski]] and [[Niesiołowski]] families. The village was administratively part of the [[Nowogródek Voivodeship (1507–1795)|Nowogródek Voivodeship]] until the [[Third Partition of Poland]] (1795) when it was annexed by [[Imperial Russia]]. In the 19th century, it belonged to the [[Countess E.A. Rozwadowski]]. It was part of the Novogrodek (now [[Navahrudak]]) [[okrug]], which was part of Slonim Governorate, the Lithuania Governorate, the [[Grodno Governorate]] and then the [[Minsk Governorate]].

=== Growth ===
[[File:Baranavičy Centralnyja. Баранавічы Цэнтральныя (1880-89).jpg|thumb|left|The central railway station in the late 19th century]]
The town's history began on 17 (29) November 1871, the beginning of construction of a movement to the new section of the Smolensk-Brest. The name of the station arose during the construction of the nearby village, Baranavichy, whose first mention was in the testament of [[A.E Sinyavskaya]] in 1627. Then, in 1871, not far from the station, the locomotive depot was built.

In 1874 came the appearance of the railway [[Junction (rail)|junction]]. In the wooden station buildings lived the railway workers of Baranavichy. The new railway linked [[Moscow]] with the western outskirts of Imperial Russia.

The impetus for more intensive settlement of the areas adjacent to the station from the south was the May 27, 1884 decision by the governor of Minsk to build a town, Rozvadovo, on the lands of the landlord, Rozwadowski. The town was built according to the governor's approved plan. In the village were 120 houses and 500 people.

The plans approved by Emperor [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] assumed that there would also be one railway linking [[Vilnius]], [[Luninets]], [[Pinsk]], and [[Rivne|Rovno]]. Therefore, 2.5&nbsp;km from the station, the Moscow-Brest railway crossed the track Vilnius-Rovno from Polesie railways. At the junction was another station, Baranavichy (according to Polesie Railways), which became the second centre of the city.

As before, workers and traders settled near the station. The new settlement was called New Baranavichy, unlike Rozvadovo, which became informally called Old Baranavichy. It was developed on the land owned by peasants of the villages near the new station (Svetilovichi, Gierow and Uznogi). More convenient than the landlords' land, its lease terms and proximity to administrative agencies contributed to the rapid growth of this settlement.

=== 20th century ===
At the beginning of World War I, Baranavichy was the location for the [[Stavka of the Supreme Commander|Stavka]], the headquarters of the Russian General Staff, until the [[Great Retreat (Russian)|Great Retreat]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Massie |first1=Robert |title=Nicholas and Alexandria |date=1967 |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York |isbn=9780345438317 |pages=300}}</ref>

[[File:Baranavičy, Marynskaja, Bank. Баранавічы, Марынская, Банк (1930-39).jpg|thumb|left|Bank of Poland in Baranowicze in the 1930s]]
After the settlement was left by the Germans, it was captured on January 5, 1919, by the Soviets. In the early stages of the [[Polish–Soviet War]], it was briefly captured by the Poles on 18 March 1919<ref>Lech Wyszczelski, ''Wojna polsko-rosyjska 1919–1920'', Bellona, Warsaw, 2010, p. 70 (in Polish)</ref> and again captured, for longer, in April 1919,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phw.org.pl/baranowicze-nowogrodek-kwiecien-1919/|title=Baranowicze – Nowogródek kwiecień 1919|website=Historia Wojskowa|author=Paweł Wlezień|access-date=22 October 2019|language=pl}}</ref> five months after [[Poland]] regained independence. The Russians retook it on 17 July 1920, but the Poles took it again on 30 September 1920.
[[File:Monument of Artur Buol in Baranavičy in 1930 (standing on stairs László Magasházy and Wacław Szalewicz).JPG|thumb|145px|Pre-war monument of Artur Buol]]

On 1 August 1919, it received [[city rights]] and became a powiat centre in the Polish [[Nowogródek Voivodeship (1919–1939)|Nowogródek Voivodeship]]. In 1921, Baranowicze had over 11,000 inhabitants (67% Jews, the rest being mostly [[Belarusians]], [[Polish people|Poles]] and [[Russians]]). Soon, the city started to grow and became an important centre of trade and commerce for the area. The city's Orthodox cathedral was built in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style in 1924 to 1931 and was decorated with mosaics that had survived the demolition of the [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Warsaw]]. In 1930, a monument to [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] [[Lieutenant colonel]] Artur Buol, a hero of Polish fights in the [[Polish–Soviet War]], was unveiled in Baranowicze.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://menway.interia.pl/historia/news-artur-buol-wegierski-bohater-wojska-polskiego,nId,1867522|title=Artur Buol - węgierski bohater Wojska Polskiego|website=Menway w Interia.pl|author=Sławek Zagórski|access-date=22 October 2019|language=pl}}</ref> In the interbellum, the grandparents and the father of Polish politicians [[Lech Kaczyński]] and [[Jarosław Kaczyński]] lived in Baranowicze.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fakt.pl/wydarzenia/polityka/kim-byl-ojciec-jaroslawa-i-lecha-kaczynskich/mjfvpk6#slajd-2|title=Kim był ojciec Jarosława i Lecha Kaczyńskich?|website=Fakt24.pl|date=17 April 2015 |access-date=22 October 2019|language=pl}}</ref>

The city was also an important military [[garrison]], with a [[Border Protection Corps|KOP]] Cavalry Brigade, the [[Polish 20th Infantry Division|20th Infantry Division]] and the [[Nowogródzka Cavalry Brigade]] stationed there. Because of the fast growth of local industry, a local branch of the [[Polish Radio]] was opened in 1938. In 1939 Baranavichy had almost 30,000 inhabitants and was the biggest and the most important city in the [[Nowogródek Voivodeship (1919–1939)|Nowogródek Voivodeship]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}

After the [[invasion of Poland]], the [[Soviet Union]] took the city on 17 September 1939 and annexed it to the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. The local Jewish population of 9,000 was joined by approximately 3,000 Jewish refugees from the Polish areas occupied by [[Germany]]. After the start of [[Operation Barbarossa]], the city was seized by the [[Wehrmacht]] on June 27, 1941. It was part of ''[[Generalbezirk Weissruthenien|Generalbezirk Weißruthenien]]'' in [[Reichskommissariat Ostland]] during the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|German occupation]]. In August 1941, a [[ghetto]] (the  [[Baranavichy Ghetto]]) was created in the city, with more than 12,000 Jews kept in terrible conditions in six buildings on the outskirts. From March 4 to December 14, 1942, the entire Jewish population of the ghetto was sent to various [[extermination camps]] and killed in [[gas chamber]]s. Only about 250 survived the war.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jewish Heritage Research Group in Belarus |url=http://jhrgbelarus.org/Heritage_Holocaust.php?pid=&lang=en&city_id=1&type=3 |access-date=2022-04-21 |website=jhrgbelarus.org |archive-date=2011-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818235829/http://jhrgbelarus.org/Heritage_Holocaust.php?pid=&lang=en&city_id=1&type=3 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Hugo Armann]], head of a unit that arranged travel for soldiers and security police, saved six people from a murder squad and another 35 to 40 people who worked for him.<ref name="YV">{{Cite web |title=Armann Hugo |url=https://righteous.yadvashem.org/?search=Hugo%20Armann&searchType=righteous_only&language=en&itemId=4013728&ind=0 |access-date=2023-04-18 |website=[[Yad Vashem]]}}</ref>

As a fairly young city, Baranavichy does not have many cultural heritage monuments. Most are buildings erected in the [[interwar period]], including the [[Catholic Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross]], the former Bank of Poland building, the building of the [[Polish Radio Baranowicze]] station, the fire station and the [[Orthodox Church of the Protection of the Holy Virgin]]. A few old houses from the early 20th century are preserved. There is a railway museum in the city.

The city is on the main east–west highway in Belarus, the [[M1 highway (Belarus)|M1]], which forms a part of [[European route E30]].

The first rail line through the city opened in around 1870. Additional railways built helped the city become an important rail junction.

The large [[Baranovichi (air base)|airbase]], south of the city, is used by the [[Belarusian Air Force]].
