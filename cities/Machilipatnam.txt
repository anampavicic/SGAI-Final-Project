== Etymology ==

During the 17th century, it was known by the names ''Masulipatnam'' , in local [[Telugu language]], 'Masuli'/'Machili' means fish and 'Patnam' means city. ''Masula'' and ''Bandar'' (Bandar translates to 'port' in [[Persian language]]).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Guru Srikanth|first1=S|title=Machilipatnam Growth May Trigger Off Reverse Migration|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/andhra_pradesh/Machilipatnam-Growth-May-Trigger-Off-Reverse-Migration/2015/04/02/article2742933.ece|access-date=10 December 2015|work=The New Indian Express|date=2 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151128195236/http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/andhra_pradesh/Machilipatnam-Growth-May-Trigger-Off-Reverse-Migration/2015/04/02/article2742933.ece|archive-date=28 November 2015|location=Machilipatnam}}</ref>{{Sfn|George|Duggal|Bhatia|Chakrabarti|p=55}}{{Sfn|Broeze|2010}} The port town in the ancient times was also referred with the name ''Maesolia''.<ref name="maesolia">{{cite news|title=The rise and fall of Maesolia port|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/the-rise-and-fall-of-maesolia-port/article7514192.ece|access-date=1 September 2016|work=The Hindu|date=8 August 2015|language=en-IN}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Masulipatam mg 8557.jpg|right|thumb|250px|View of Masulipatam in 1676]]

The town has existed since at least the 3rd century BCE ([[Satavahana]] period) when, according to [[Ptolemy]], it was known as Maisolos. The ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' calls it Masalia in the 1st-century BCE.<ref>[http://buddhism.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ENG/long.htm The Great Stupa at Nagarjunakonda in Southern India], p. 187</ref> The port is on the southeastern, or [[Coromandel Coast]], of India. At the mouth of the [[River Krishna]] on the Bay of Bengal, the Masula port saw flourishing sea trade.{{citation needed|date= September 2022}}

Muslin was traded by ancient Greeks from the town and the word ''[[muslin]]'' originated from the name Maisolos.<ref>Periplus, Point 62; http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/periplus.asp {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204143633/http://legacy.fordham.edu/Halsall/ancient/periplus.asp |date=4 February 2017 }}</ref> Muslin was an important source of income for the town, being a favourite of Roman traders for domestic consumption. Several Roman coins were found during excavations of Buddhist towns near Machilipatnam.<ref>''Buddhist Monks and Monasteries of India: Their History and Their Contribution to Indian Culture'' by Sukumar Butt, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, 1988, p. 132</ref>

The town served as the primary sea port for the [[Kingdom of Golkonda]]. It was an outlet for textiles produced in the [[Godavari Delta]]. It was a major source of income for the kingdom, and contributed to its immense prosperity in the 1620s and 1630s.{{Sfn|Eaton|2008|p=157}}

By the end of the 17th century, the port city had fallen into decline. This coincided with the [[Siege of Golconda|Mughal conquest of Golkonda]]. However, mismanagement prior to the conquest may have also been a factor in the city's decline.{{Sfn|Eaton|2008|p=159}}

[[Salabat Jung]], the son of Nizam-ul-Mulk [[Nizam-ul-Mulk, Asaf Jah I|Asaf Jah I]], who was indebted for his elevation to the throne to the [[French East India Company]], granted them in return for their services the district of [[Kondavid]] or [[Guntur]], and soon afterwards the remainder of the [[Northern Circars|Circars]]. The Circars were captured by the British from the French in 1759 and were returned to the Nizam, however, Masulipatnam was retained by the [[East India Company]].<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Circar |volume=6 |page=380}}</ref>

The town was the district headquarters of the then, Masulipatnam district and now to the [[Krishna district]], which was formed in 1859 in the composite [[Madras state]].<ref name="census" />{{Sfn|Poole|1865|p=89}}

== Geographical area ==
Machilipatnam city is at {{Coord|16.17|N|81.13|E|}} on the southeast coast of India and in the east coast of Andhra Pradesh.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/02/Machilipatnam.html|title=redirect to /world/IN/02/Machilipatnam.html|work=fallingrain.com}}</ref> The city has an average elevation of 14&nbsp;meters (45&nbsp;feet).<ref>{{Cite web |title=overview1758 |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00maplinks/mughal/bellinmasulipatam/overview1758.jpg |website=[[Columbia University]]}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
Machilipatnam (city) gets most of its annual rainfall due to the [[southwest monsoon]]. It has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Aw'') with hot summers and moderate winters. The hottest months are between April and June. The average normal rainfall in the district is {{convert|959|mm|in}} and Machilipatnam is vulnerable to high surges of the sea due to [[cyclone]]s. The [[1977 Andhra Pradesh cyclone]] crossed the coast near [[Nizampatnam]] and took approximately 10,000 lives. As the storm approached the coast, gale winds reaching 200&nbsp;km/h lashed [[Prakasam district|Prakasam]], [[Guntur]], [[Krishna]], [[East Godavari]] and [[West Godavari]] districts. A storm surge, 5 meters high, inundated the Krishna [[estuary]] and the coast south of the city (Bandar).

On 8 December 2004, a high capacity S-Band Doppler cyclone warning radar was installed, commissioned and made operational at the city<ref>{{cite web|title=Weather Radar Network of India Meteorological Department|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/doc/ins-radar.htm|website=India Meteorological Department|access-date=13 November 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512011325/http://www.imd.gov.in/doc/ins-radar.htm|archive-date=12 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> by the German manufacturer Gematronik. With the installation of the radar, it is hoped the state will be better equipped to track cyclones. The facility will monitor the 960&nbsp;km long coastline of the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2004/05/08/stories/2004050805620400.htm|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=2004-05-08|title=Andhra Pradesh News: Modern cyclone warning system for Machilipatnam}}{{dead link|date=April 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>
