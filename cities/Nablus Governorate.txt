The '''Nablus Governorate''' ({{langx|ar|محافظة نابلس}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Muḥāfaẓat Nāblus}}'') is an administrative district of [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] located in the Central Highlands of the [[West Bank]], 53&nbsp;km north of [[Jerusalem]]. It covers the area around the city of [[Nablus]] which serves as the ''muhfaza'' (seat) of the governorate. The governor of the district is [[Mahmoud Aloul]].

== History ==
During the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman period]], the region later forming the Nablus Governorate belonged to [[Nablus Sanjak|Jabal Nablus]]. Like other regions of Nablus' peripheral hinterland, it followed the provincial center, led by a closely knit web of economic, social and political relations between Nablus’ urban notables and the city’s surroundings. With the help of [[Rural notables (Palestine)|rural trading partners]], these urban notables established trading [[Monopoly|monopolies]] that transformed Jabal Nablus’ [[Autarky|autarkic]] economy into an export-driven market, shipping vast quantities of [[cash crop]]s and [[finished goods]] to off-shore [[Market (economics)|markets]]. Increasing demand for these [[commodities]] in the Ottoman Empire’s urban centers and in Europe spurred demographic growth and settlement expansion in the lowlands surrounding Jabal Nablus.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Marom |first=Roy |author-link=Roy Marom |date=2024 |title=The Palestinian Rural Notables’ Class in Ascendency: The Hannun Family of Tulkarm (Palestine) |url=https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/10.3366/hlps.2024.0327 |journal=Journal of Holy Land and Palestine Studies |language=en |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=77–108 |doi=10.3366/hlps.2024.0327 |issn=2054-1988|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Doumani |first=Beshara |url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520203709/rediscovering-palestine |title=Rediscovering Palestine: Merchants and Peasants in Jabal Nablus, 1700–1900 |date=1995 |isbn=978-0-520-20370-9 |language=en}}</ref>

During the first six months of the [[First Intifada]] 85 people were killed in Nablus Governorate by the [[Israeli army]]. This was the highest total of all the [[West Bank]] Governorates.<ref>B'Tselem information sheet July 1989. p. 4.
