'''Augusta''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|ɡ|ʌ|s|t|ə}} {{respell|ə|GUSS|tə}}) is a [[city]] on the central eastern border of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The city lies directly across the [[Savannah River]] from [[North Augusta, South Carolina]] at the head of its navigable portion. Georgia's [[List of municipalities in Georgia (U.S. state)|third most populous city]] (after [[Atlanta]] and [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]]), Augusta is located in the [[Fall Line]] section of the state.

According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], Augusta had a 2020 population of 202,081,<ref name="QuickFacts" /> not counting the unconsolidated towns of [[Blythe, Georgia|Blythe]] and [[Hephzibah, Georgia|Hephzibah]] which fall under Augusta-Richmond County.<ref name="GAcity2017">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/popest/total-cities-and-towns.html |access-date=May 24, 2018 |title=2017 U.S. Census Estimates–List of Places |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922122027/https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/popest/total-cities-and-towns.html |archive-date=September 22, 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> It is the [[List of United States cities by population|116th most populous city in the United States]] and the [[List of metropolitan statistical areas|92nd-largest]] metropolitan area. The process of consolidation between the city of Augusta and [[Richmond County, Georgia|Richmond County]] began with a 1995 referendum in the two jurisdictions. The merger was completed on July 1, 1996. Augusta is the principal city of the [[Augusta metropolitan area]]. In 2020 it had a population of 206,000,<ref name="2020Pop" /> making it the [[List of metropolitan areas in Georgia (U.S. state)|second-largest metro area]] in the state (after [[Atlanta]]) and the ninth most populous urban center in the [[Deep South]] with a metro population of 611,000.

Augusta was established in 1736 and is named in honor of [[Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha]] (1719–1772), the bride of [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]] and the mother of the British monarch [[George III]].<ref name="autogenerated1"/> During the [[American Civil War]], Augusta housed the principal [[Confederate Powderworks]].<ref>"Augusta", in ''The Concise Columbia Encyclopedia'' (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1994), p. 56.</ref> Augusta's warm climate made it a major resort town of the Eastern United States in the early and mid-20th century. Internationally, Augusta is best known for hosting the [[Masters Tournament|Masters golf tournament]] each spring. The Masters brings over 200,000 visitors from around the world to the [[Augusta National Golf Club]]. Membership at Augusta National is widely considered to be the most prestigious in the sport of golf around the world.

Augusta lies approximately two hours away from downtown Atlanta by car via [[Interstate 20|I-20]]. The city is home to [[Fort Eisenhower]], a major U.S. Army base formerly known as Fort Gordon. In 2016, it was announced that the new National Cyber Security Headquarters would be based in Augusta.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Johnson |first=Bianca Cain |title=Ground broken on new cyber command headquarters at Fort Gordon |url=https://www.augustachronicle.com/story/news/2016/11/29/ground-broken-new-cyber-command-headquarters-fort-gordon/14275388007/ |access-date=2024-01-31 |website=The Augusta Chronicle |language=en-US}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Augusta, Georgia|Timeline of Augusta, Georgia}}

=== Establishment ===
The area along the river was long inhabited by varying cultures of [[indigenous peoples]], who relied on the river for fish, water and transportation.  The site of Augusta was used by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] as a place to cross the Savannah River, because of its location on the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]].
[[File:James Oglethorpe Statue Augusta GA.jpg|left|thumb|[[James Oglethorpe]], Founder of Augusta]]
In 1735, two years after [[James Oglethorpe]] founded [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], he sent a detachment of troops to explore the upper Savannah River. He gave them an order to build a fort at the head of the navigable part of the river. The expedition was led by [[Noble Jones]], who created a settlement as a first line of [[defense (military)|defense]] for coastal areas against potential [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] or [[Kingdom of France|French]] invasion from the interior.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Robertson |first1=Thomas Heard Jr. |title=The Colonial Plan of Augusta |journal=Georgia Historical Quarterly |date=2002 |volume=86 |issue=4 |page=511 }}</ref> Oglethorpe named the town in honor of [[Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha|Princess Augusta]], the mother of [[King George III]] and the wife of [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]].

Oglethorpe visited Augusta in September 1739 on his return to Savannah from a perilous visit to Coweta Town, near present-day [[Phenix City, Alabama]].<ref name="CowetaMarker">{{cite web |url=https://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM6EEB_Coweta_Town_KVWETV_Phenix_City_AL |publisher=KVWE-TV |access-date=June 23, 2018 |title=Coweta Town historical marker |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623222105/http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM6EEB_Coweta_Town_KVWETV_Phenix_City_AL |archive-date=June 23, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> There, he had met with a convention of 7,000 Native American warriors and concluded a peace treaty with them in their territories in northern and western Georgia.<ref>''Memorial History of Augusta, Georgia: from Its Settlement in 1735 to the Close of the Eighteenth Century'' by Charles Colcock Jones, Salem Dutcher (Augusta, GA: D. Mason, 1890) page 31</ref> During the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[Siege of Augusta]] resulted in the retaking the city from the British by the Americans. Augusta was the second state capital of Georgia from 1785 until 1795 (alternating for a period with Savannah, the first).

=== Development ===
Augusta developed rapidly as a market town as the [[Black Belt (geological formation)|Black Belt]] in the Piedmont was developed for cotton cultivation. Invention of the cotton gin made processing of short-staple cotton profitable, and this type of cotton was well-suited to the upland areas. Cotton plantations were worked by slave labor, with hundreds of thousands of slaves shipped from the Upper South to the Deep South in the domestic [[History of slavery|slave trade]]. Many of the slaves were brought from the [[Lowcountry]], where their [[Gullah]] culture had developed on the large [[Sea Island Cotton|Sea Island cotton]] and rice plantations.

During the [[American Civil War]], Augusta was home to many war industries including powder-works facilities.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Civil War History in Augusta {{!}} Historic Landmarks & Sites |url=https://www.visitaugusta.com/things-to-do/museums-and-history/mid-1800s/ |access-date=2024-01-31 |website=www.visitaugusta.com}}</ref> After the war, Augusta had a booming textile industry leading to the construction of many mills along the Augusta Canal to include Enterprise Mill, Sibley Mill, and King Mill.

The city experienced the [[Augusta Fire of 1916]], which damaged 25 blocks of the town and many buildings of historical significance.

As a major city in the area, Augusta was a center of activities during [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] and after. In the mid-20th century, it was a site of civil rights demonstrations. In 1970, Charles Oatman, a mentally disabled teenager, was killed by his cellmates in an Augusta jail. A protest against his death broke out in a [[1970 Augusta riot|riot]] involving 500 people, after six black men were killed by police,<ref name=cr>{{cite web |url=http://www.civilrights.uga.edu/cities/augusta/godfather_of_soul.htm |title=Freedom On Film: Civil Rights In Georgia |access-date=June 20, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923204420/http://www.civilrights.uga.edu/cities/augusta/godfather_of_soul.htm |archive-date=September 23, 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> each found to have been shot in the back.<ref>"Baltimore is Everywhere," ''[[New York Magazine]],'' May 18–31, 2015, p. 33.</ref> The noted singer and entertainer [[James Brown]] was called in to help quell lingering tensions, which he succeeded in doing.<ref name=cr/>

=== Hyde Park contamination ===
{{main|Hyde Park, Georgia}}
In 1993, an area known as Hyde Park in Augusta, Georgia, was investigated by the EPA for contamination. The investigation totaled $1.2 million.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Checker |first=Melissa |date=2007 |title="But I Know It's True" Environmental Risk, Assessment, Justice, and Anthropology |journal=Human Organization |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=112–124 |doi=10.17730/humo.66.2.1582262175731728}}</ref> Air, groundwater, and soil were all believed to be contaminated, and people living in the area were hoping for government assistance to move away from Hyde Park. Two of five neighborhoods in Hyde Park appeared to have arsenic, chromium, and dioxin, while all five were found to have PCBs and lead.<ref name=":0" /> However, residents were told it was not a risk to their health unless they somehow ingested it on a regular basis. At the time the article was written, the citizens still questioned why the EPA and ATSDR (Agency for Toxic Disease Registry) did not consider these chemicals as a threat to them. Hyde Park also has higher rates of certain illnesses (such as cancer, infections, rashes) than the average in America, and the citizens question why that is not considered.<ref name=":0" />

==Geography==
Augusta is located along the Georgia/South Carolina border, about {{cvt|150|mi}} east of [[Atlanta]] and {{cvt|70|mi}} west of [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]]. The city is located at {{Coord|33|28|12|N|81|58|30|W|type:city}} (33.4700, −81.9750).<ref name="GR1">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=April 23, 2011 |date=February 12, 2011 |title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990 |archive-date=August 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190824085937/https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the Augusta–Richmond County balance has a total area of {{cvt|306.5|sqmi|1}}, of which {{cvt|302.1|sqmi|1}} is land and {{cvt|4.3|sqmi|1}} (1.42%) is water.
[[File:Augusta Canal tour boat music cruise.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Augusta Canal]]]]
Augusta is located about halfway up the [[Savannah River]] on the [[fall line]], which creates a number of small falls on the river. The city marks the end of a navigable waterway for the river and the entry to the Georgia [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] area.

The [[J. Strom Thurmond Dam|Clarks Hill Dam]] is built on the fall line near Augusta, forming [[Clarks Hill Lake]]. Farther downstream, near the border of [[Columbia County, Georgia|Columbia County]], is the Stevens Creek Dam, which generates [[hydroelectric power]].  Even farther downstream is the Augusta Diversion Dam, which marks the beginning of the [[Augusta Canal]] and channels Savannah River waters into the canal.<ref>[http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2003/06/29/pav_379852.shtml "Officials consider relicensing Augusta Canal"] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017155844/http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2003/06/29/pav_379852.shtml |date=October 17, 2015 }}, ''Augusta Chronicle'', June 29, 2003</ref>

===Climate===
As with the rest of the state, Augusta has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), with short, mild winters, very hot, humid summers, and a wide [[diurnal temperature variation]] throughout much of the year, despite its low elevation and humidity. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from {{cvt|45.4|°F|1}} in January to {{cvt|81.6|°F|1}} in July; there are 53 nights with the low reaching the freezing mark, 82 days reaching or exceeding {{cvt|90|°F|0}}, and 5.5 days reaching {{cvt|100|°F|0}} annually. Extreme temperatures range from {{cvt|−1|°F|0}} on [[January 1985 Arctic outbreak|January 21, 1985]] up to {{cvt|108|°F|0}} on August 10, 2007, and August 21, 1983. Snowfall is not nearly as common as in Atlanta, due largely to Augusta's elevation, with downtown Augusta being about {{cvt|900|ft|-1}} lower than downtown Atlanta. The heaviest recorded snowfall was in February 1973 with {{Convert|14.0|in|cm}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=Is It True that Snow is Rare in Augusta, Georgia? |url=https://augustaplanet.com/is-it-true-that-snow-is-rare-in-augusta-georgia-2022/ |website=Augusta Planet}}</ref> Freezing rain is also a threat in wintertime.

==Law and government==
{{See also|List of mayors of Augusta, Georgia}}
In 1995, citizens of Augusta and unincorporated parts of [[Richmond County, Georgia|Richmond County]] voted to [[Consolidated city-county|consolidate]] their city and county governments. Citizens of [[Hephzibah, Georgia|Hephzibah]] and [[Blythe, Georgia|Blythe]], also located in Richmond County, voted against joining in the merger, which took effect January 1, 1996. The unified government consists of a [[List of mayors of Augusta, Georgia|mayor]] and ten [[commissioner]]s. Eight commissioners represent single-member districts, while two are elected at-large, each to represent a super district that encompasses half of Augusta-Richmond's population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.augustaga.gov/index.aspx?NID=524 |title=Maps |access-date=December 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527094736/http://www.augustaga.gov/index.aspx?NID=524 |archive-date=May 27, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> Law enforcement in Augusta is handled by the Richmond County Sheriff's Office which patrols the main city of Augusta and the unincorporated areas of [[Hephzibah, Georgia|Hephzibah]] and [[Blythe, Georgia|Blythe]] although both of these towns have their own police departments. Prior to consolidation, Augusta had a city police department and the [[Richmond County, Georgia|Richmond County]] sheriff patrolled the unincorporated areas of the county. The consolidation charter deems the sheriff as the chief law enforcement officer of Richmond County. Augusta is one of the few consolidated city-counties in the state that retain the sheriff in a law enforcement capacity.
