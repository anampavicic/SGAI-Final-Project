== Name ==
The present-day city of Jashore was originally known as '''Kasba'''.<!-- Habib, p. 45 --> The current name was originally acquired from the name of the surrounding ''[[pargana]]'' and ''[[zamindar]]i'' estate of Jashore, or ''Jesar'', when Kasba became its capital.<!-- Habib, p. 45 --> The district's name was also applied to its two previous capitals, which are now known as [[Ishwaripur]] and [[Murali, Bangladesh|Murali]], respectively, so early mentions of jashore are not referring to the modern town.<!-- Habib, p. 45 --><ref name="Habib 1982">{{cite book |last1=Habib |first1=Irfan |title=An Atlas of the Mughal Empire |date=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0195603796 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Buo9AQAAIAAJ |access-date=26 March 2023}}</ref>{{rp|45}}

The name "Jashore" is traditionally explained as a derivation from the [[Sanskrit]] name ''Yaśohara'', meaning "glory-depriving".<!-- Westland, p. 23 --><ref name="Westland 1874">{{cite book |last1=Westland |first1=J. |title=A Report on the District of Jashore: Its Antiquities, Its History, and Its Commerce |date=1874 |publisher=Bengal Secretariat Press |location=Calcutta |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B2lKAAAAYAAJ |access-date=15 May 2023}}</ref>{{rp|23}} The name originally applied to the town now called Ishwaripur,<ref name="Habib 1982"/>{{rp|45}} which was founded sometime after 1573-74 by Vikramaditya, father of [[Pratapaditya]].<!-- Westland, p. 23 --> According to J. Westland, "glory-depriving" may have been used in the sense of "so glorious that it makes other cities seem humble in comparison".<!-- Westland, p. 23 --> An inscription at [[Kanhaynagar]] records a similar epithet for that place: ''ruchira-ruchi-hara'', or "depriving of beauty that which is beautiful".<ref name="Westland 1874"/>{{rp|23}}

== History ==
{{Main|History of Jessore}}
The ''[[Ain-i Akbari]]'' lists a pargana of Jesar as part of ''[[sarkar (administrative division)|sarkar]]'' [[Bagherhat|Khalifatabad]].<!-- Habib, p. 45 --> This Jesar is a reference to today's Ishwaripur.<!-- Habib, p. 45 --> Ishwaripur is also the Jesar mentioned in the ''[[Baharistan-i-Ghaibi|Bahāristān-i Ghaibī]]''.<!-- Habib, p. 45 --> The zamindars of Jesar later shifted their capital to Murali and then to nearby Kasba, and the name "Jessore" was transferred to each of them in succession.<!-- Habib, p. 45 --> One or both of these shifts had happened by around 1660, when [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Van_de_Brook%27s_map.jpg Mattheus van den Broucke's map of Bengal] shows a "Jessoor" in the same spot as today's city; however, because Murali and Kasba are so close together, it's uncertain which one specifically is being shown here.<ref name="Habib 1982"/>{{rp|45}}

It was the capital of [[Pratapaditya]], the one and only Hindu ruler of the 12 Bhuiyas of Bengal, who had also famously fought against Mughal intrusion in East Bengal. He was defeated by Mughal forces and his territories were annexed into the [[Mughal Empire]].

It was the first district to be freed and taken back by Bengali rule in the [[Liberation War of Bangladesh|Liberation War]], on 8 December 1971.
