'''Primorsky Krai''',{{efn|{{langx|ru|Приморский край|Primorskiy kray|Maritime Territory}}, {{IPA|ru|prʲɪˈmorskʲɪj kraj}}}} informally known as '''Primorye''',{{efn|{{langx|ru|Приморье}}, {{IPA|ru|prʲɪˈmorʲjɪ}}}} is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] (a [[krais of Russia|krai]]) of Russia, part of the [[Far Eastern Federal District]] in the [[Russian Far East]]. The [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of [[Vladivostok]] on the southern coast of the krai is its [[administrative center]], and the second largest city in the Russian Far East, behind [[Khabarovsk]] in the neighbouring krai. Primorsky Krai has the largest economy among the federal subjects in the Russian Far East, and a [[list of federal subjects of Russia by population|population]] of&nbsp;1,845,165 as of the [[Russian Census (2021)|2021 Census]].<ref name="2021Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2021Census}}</ref>

[[File:Full coat of arms of Primorsky Krai.svg|thumb|Full coat of arms of Primorsky Krai]]

The krai has Russia's only [[North Korea–Russia border|border with North Korea]], along the [[Tumen River]] in [[Khasansky District]] in the southwestern corner of the krai. [[Peter the Great Gulf]], the largest gulf in the [[Sea of Japan]], is on the south coast.

The territory of the krai was historically part of [[Manchuria]]. It was [[Convention of Peking|ceded]] to the [[Russian Empire]] by [[Qing China]] in 1860 as part of a region known as [[Outer Manchuria]], forming most of the territory of [[Primorskaya Oblast]]. As a result, China permanently lost its coastline with [[Sea of Japan|the Sea of Japan]]. During the [[Russian Civil War]] it became part of the [[Far Eastern Republic]] before joining the [[Soviet Union]], going through numerous changes until reaching its current form in 1938. Primorsky Krai is home to the [[Russian Navy]]'s [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Pacific Fleet]] and is also known as the birthplace of North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-il]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.history.com/.amp/this-day-in-history/kim-jong-il-leader-of-north-korea-dies | title=Kim Jong Il, leader of North Korea, dies &#124; HISTORY }}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name of the krai is derived from the Russian words {{lang|ru|приморский}} ({{transliteration|ru|primorsky}}), meaning "littoral" or "coastal", and {{lang|ru|край}} ({{transliteration|ru|kray}}), meaning "region" or "area".<ref name="britannica">{{Cite web|title=Primorye {{!}} kray, Russia|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Primorye|access-date=2020-09-12|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=приморский translations and declension|url=https://en.openrussian.org/ru/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9|access-date=2020-09-12|website=en.openrussian.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=край translations, 37 examples and declension|url=https://en.openrussian.org/ru/%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B9|access-date=2020-09-12|website=en.openrussian.org}}</ref> It is informally known as '''Primorye''' ({{lang|ru|Приморье}}, {{IPA|ru|prʲɪˈmorʲjɪ|IPA}}) in Russian, and is occasionally translated as '''Maritime Territory''' in English.<ref name="britannica" />

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Primorsky Krai}}

*'''Border length'''&nbsp;— over {{convert|3000.|km|sp=us}}, including {{convert|1350.|km|sp=us}} of the sea borders.
*'''Highest peak'''&nbsp;— [[Anik Mountain]], {{convert|1933|m|sp=us}}
*'''Rail network length'''&nbsp;— {{convert|1628|km|sp=us}} (of which {{convert|345|km|sp=us}} are electrified).
*'''Automobile road length'''&nbsp;— {{convert|12633|km|sp=us}}

Primorsky Krai, bordered by [[China ]]([[Jilin]] and [[Heilongjiang]]), [[North Korea]] ([[Rason]]) and [[Khabarovsk Krai]], and the relatively warm—although freezing in winter—waters of the [[Sea of Japan]], is the southeasternmost region of Russia, located between the [[42nd parallel north|42°]] and [[48th parallel north|48° north]] latitude and [[130th meridian east|130°]] and [[139th meridian east|139° east]] longitude. It is stretched in the [[meridian (geography)|meridianal]] direction, the distance from its extreme northern point to its most southerly point being about {{convert|900.|km|sp=us}}.

===Topography===

[[File:Река Уссури у посёлка Горные Ключи.JPG|thumb|[[Ussuri River]]]]
[[File:Philippovsky Bay Beach.jpg|thumb|Philippovsky Bay, [[Russky Island]]]]
[[File:Вид на долину р. Бикин с видовой площадки (гора Клин).jpg|thumb|[[Bikin National Park]]]]

Highlands dominate the territory of the krai. Most of the territory is mountainous, and almost 80% of it is forested. The average elevation is about {{convert|500.|m|sp=us}}. [[Sikhote-Alin]] is a mountainous formation, extending for the most part of the Krai. It consists of a number of parallel ranges: the Partizansky (Partisan), the Siny (Blue), the Kholodny (Cold), and others. There are many [[karst]] caves in the south of Primorye, including the relatively accessible Spyashchaya Krasavitsa cave (the Sleeping Beauty) in the Ussuriysky Nature Preserve. There are comparatively well-preserved fragments of ancient volcanoes in the area.

The ranges are cut by the picturesque narrow and deep valleys of the rivers and by large brooks, such as the [[Partizanskaya River|Partizanskaya]], the [[Kiyevka River|Kiyevka]], the Zerkalnaya, the Cheryomukhovaya, the Yedinka, the [[Samarga River|Samarga]], the [[Bikin River|Bikin]], and the [[Bolshaya Ussurka River|Bolshaya Ussurka]]. Most rivers in the [[Krai]] have rocky bottoms and limpid water. The largest among them is the [[Ussuri River|Ussuri]], with a length of {{convert|903|km|sp=us}}. The head of the [[Ussuri River]] originates {{convert|20|km|sp=us}} east of Oblachnaya Mountain. The vast Khanka Lowlands extend into the west and southwest of Primorye, carpeted by coniferous-deciduous forest. A part of the Lowland surrounding the largest lake in the [[Russian Far East]], [[Khanka Lake]], is occupied by a forest-steppe.

===Coast and islands===
The krai's coastline is fairly straight, except for the southernmost section around Vladivostok which contains the [[Muravyov-Amursky Peninsula]].
There are numerous islands in this area, the main ones being [[Lisy Island]], Askold Island, [[Putyatin Island]], [[Skrebtsov island]], [[Sibiryakov Island]], the [[Eugénie Archipelago]] (the largest island of which being [[Russky Island]]), the [[Rimsky-Korsakov Archipelago]] and [[Furugelm Island]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hu |first1=Yang |last2=Hu |first2=Yunfeng |title=Detecting Forest Disturbance and Recovery in Primorsky Krai, Russia, Using Annual Landsat Time Series and Multi–Source Land Cover Products |journal=Remote Sensing |date=1 January 2020 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=129 |doi=10.3390/rs12010129 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338363787 |access-date=8 December 2023 |doi-access=free |bibcode=2020RemS...12..129H }}</ref>

===Flora and fauna===
The geographic location of Primorye accounts for the variety of its [[flora (plants)|flora]]. The territory of Primorye has not been subjected to the ice cover in the past in contrast to the rest of Siberia during the ice ages. The specifics of the geographic situation and the specific features of climate determine the unique diversity of the plant world at species and genetic levels and the richness of plant resources. In the flora of Primorye, there are more than two thousand species of higher plants, of which are about 250 species of trees, bushes, and ligneous lianas. Flora of mosses and lichens are very diverse. As part of the coastal flora, there are many valuable medicinal, technical and food plants, many relict and endemic species. About 200 species are listed in the IUCN Red List as rare and threatened extermination.

There are mountainous tundra areas, conifers and coniferous-deciduous forests, and forest-steppe, which is sometimes called the Far Eastern Prairie, where many ancient plant species have been preserved, including [[fern]]s, [[nelumbo|lotus]], and the willow ''[[Salix arbutifolia]]'' (syn. ''Chosenia arbutifolia''). The flora of the territory contains such plants as ''[[Taxus cuspidata]]'', ''[[Juniperus rigida]]'', ''[[Phellodendron amurense]]'', ''[[Kalopanax]]'', ''[[Aralia elata]]'', ''[[Maackia amurensis]]'', ''[[Alnus japonica]]'', ''[[Actinidia kolomikta]]'', ''[[Schisandra chinensis]]'', ''[[Celastrus orbiculatus]]'', ''[[Thladiantha dubia]]'', ''[[Weigela]]'', ''[[Eleutherococcus]]'', ''[[Flueggea suffruticosa]]'', ''[[Deutzia]]'', ''[[Nelumbo nucifera]]'', ''[[Betula schmidtii]]'', ''Carpinus cordata'', ''[[Acer mandshuricum]]'', ''[[Parthenocissus tricuspidata]]'', ''[[Vitis amurensis]]'', ''[[Panax ginseng]]'' and many others.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hu |first1=Yang |last2=Hu |first2=Yunfeng |title=Detecting Forest Disturbance and Recovery in Primorsky Krai, Russia, Using Annual Landsat Time Series and Multi–Source Land Cover Products |journal=Remote Sensing |date=1 January 2020 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=129 |doi=10.3390/rs12010129 |doi-access=free |bibcode=2020RemS...12..129H }}</ref>

The [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] of Primorye is also diverse. The following animals are found in the [[Krai]]: [[Ussuri black bear]] (''Ursus thibetanus''), [[Amur tiger]], [[Amur leopard]] (''Panthera pardus orientalis''), [[Eurasian lynx]] (''Lynx lynx''), [[wild boar]] (''Sus scrofa''), [[Manchurian deer]] (''Cervus elaphus xanthopygos''), [[Siberian roe deer]] (''Capreolus pygargus''), [[musk deer]] (''Moschus moschiferus''), [[long-tailed goral]] (''Naemorhedus caudatus''), [[sika deer]] (''Cervus nippon''), [[sable]] (''Martes zibellina''), [[Blakiston's fish owl]] (''Bubo blakistoni''), [[mandarinka duck]] (''Aix galericulata''), [[black stork]] (''Ciconia nigra''), [[scaly goosander]] (''Mergus squamatus''), [[chestnut-cheeked starling]] (''Sturnia philippensis''), [[black griffon]] (''Aegypius monachus''), large-winged cuckoo (family [[Cuculidae]]), and others. Among 690 species of birds inhabiting the territory of the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]], 350 are found in Primorye. Rich fisheries of [[salmon]], [[Hucho taimen]], [[lenok]] and marine fisheries of crab, pollock and other species make the aquatic and maritime environment a valuable resource for the region. However, the rich diversity of wildlife in Primorye is threatened by poaching and the illegal [[wildlife trade]]. [[Wildlife Conservation Society]], [[World Wildlife Fund]], [[Wild Salmon Center]], and Russian NGOs including [[Phoenix Fund]] are active in the region's wildlife and habitat conservation.

The area is believed to have been settled by several Tungusic and Mongolic tribes, such as the [[Sushen]], the proto-Mongol [[Shiwei people|Shiwei]] and the [[Mohe people|Mohe]]. Although, there are other popular theories, such as the fact that the place was earlier settled by the [[Ainu people]].

The [[Udege people]] are said to have traditionally settled in territories along the [[Bikin River]] long ago, however, they are possibly of [[Jianzhou Jurchen]] origin.<ref name=cerd>[http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session4/RU/RAIPON_IWGIA_RUS_UPR_S4_2009anx_Indigenous_Peoples_Russia_RAIPON_INFOE_2008.pdf Discrimination against indigenous small-numbered peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East of the Russian Federation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035835/http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session4/RU/RAIPON_IWGIA_RUS_UPR_S4_2009anx_Indigenous_Peoples_Russia_RAIPON_INFOE_2008.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}. (Parallel report submitted to the [[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination#Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination|UN Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]], [[RAIPON]], June 13, 2008)</ref>

During the [[Balhae Kingdom]], most of the krai was within the boundaries of the provinces of Dingli, Anbian and Anyuan. After Balhae was conquered by the Khitans, the territory became part of [[Liao dynasty]]'s Eastern Circuit and [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]]'s Supin Circuit. It then came under [[Mongol]] and [[Manchu]] rule.

The acquisition of [[Siberia]] by the [[Tsardom of Russia]] and the subsequent Russian expansion to the Far East brought the Russians into direct contact with [[Qing dynasty|China]]. The [[Nerchinsk Treaty]] of 1689 demarcating the borders of the two states gave all lands lying south of the [[Stanovoy Mountains]], including Primorye, to the Qing Empire. However, with the weakening of the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]]{{explain|date=October 2015}} in the second half of the 19th century, Russia began its expansion into the area. In 1858, the towns of [[Khabarovsk]] and [[Blagoveshchensk]] were founded. In 1858, [[Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky]] signed the [[Aigun Treaty]] with China, followed by the [[Convention of Peking|Beijing Treaty]] two years later. As a result of the two treaties, the Sino–Russian border shifted south in the [[Amur Annexation]] to the [[Amur River|Amur]] and [[Ussuri River]]s, granting Russia full control of Primorye.

[[Primorskaya Oblast]] was established as the easternmost division of the [[Russian Empire]] in 1856. It included the territory of modern Primorsky Krai as well as the territories of modern [[Khabarovsk Krai]] and [[Magadan Oblast]], stretching from Vladivostok to the [[Chukchi Peninsula]] in the far north.

In the period from 1859 to 1882, ninety-five settlements were established in the Primorye region, including Vladivostok, [[Ussuriysk]], Razdolnoye, Vladimiro-Aleksandrovskoye, [[Shkotovo]], [[Pokrovka, Oktyabrsky District, Primorsky Krai|Pokrovka]], Tury Rog, and [[Kamen-Rybolov]]. Russians began migrating to these regions. The population was primarily engaged in hunting, fishing and cultivation. More than two-thirds of the territory's inhabitants followed these occupations.
[[File:Primorskaya Oblast CoA.png|thumb|left|Coat of arms of Primorskaya Oblast in the beginning of the 20th century]]

During the latter part of the 19th century, there was a significant resource, industrial and resulting economic development in Primorye. Coal mining became a prominent industry, as did the export of [[Seakale|sea-kale]], [[velvet antler]]s, [[timber]], [[crab]], [[dried fish]], and [[Sea cucumber (food)|trepangs]]. The rapid economic expansion of Primorye was financed in large measure by Russian and foreign capital investment.

After the Russian Revolution and the victory of the communists, the new government renamed Primorskaya Oblast as the [[Zemstvo of Maritime Territory]]. It was defined as the [[Far-Eastern Republic]] (1920–1922). Within the [[Russian SFSR]], this became Far-Eastern Oblast (1922–1926) and then Far-Eastern Krai (1926–1938).

The area became a battleground for allied and Bolshevik troops during the [[Siberian Intervention]]. In 1922, shortly before the end of the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]], Primorye came under Bolshevik control. The new government directed the economic, scientific, and cultural development of the territory. The [[Soviet Union|Soviet Government]] spent the following ten years combating "bourgeois ideology" in many areas of life and culture. As a result, the music, theater, literature, and the fine arts of Primorye were censored.

Primorsky was the center of the ethnic Korean minority of Russia. The Pos'et Korean National Raion was created under the policy of [[Korenizatsiya]]. The Krai had 105 both fully and mixed Korean towns where residents used the Korean language as an official language. Nearly 200,000 ethnic Koreans were living in the Krai by the time of their [[Deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union|deportation in 1938]].<ref name="Pohl10">{{harvnb|Pohl|1999|p=10}}</ref> The Soviet Union had earlier deported ethnic Chinese from western Siberia.

During this period, the Soviet government emphasized [[planned economy|centralized planning]] of the economy. As in the rest of the Soviet Union, priority was given to heavy industry, with a special emphasis on mining and commercial fishing. There was a widespread investment in the construction of rail and sea transit, and new port facilities were constructed.

Primorsky Krai was formed by further subdivision of Far-Eastern Krai in 1938, as part of the Stalin-era policy of "unbundling". Primorsky Krai, as defined in 1938, corresponds to the northeastern part of the historical region of [[Russian Manchuria (Russia)|Russian Manchuria]].

On April 18, 1942, the region became accidentally involved in [[World War II]], which the United States had entered after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Primorsky Krai was the location where one of 16 [[United States Army Air Corps]] [[B-25 Mitchell]] [[medium bomber]]s landed. The group had been launched from [[USS Hornet (CV-8)|USS ''Hornet'']] to carry out the [[Doolittle Raid]] on Japan. Japan and the Soviet Union were not then at war. The landing occurred 40 miles (65&nbsp;km) west of Vladivostok; the bomber's crew could not return to their base, the aircraft carrier ''Hornet,'' by the mission plan.<ref>See the article on the [[Doolittle Raid#The Raid|Doolittle Raid]].</ref> The crew later returned home via Iran.

During the 1970s, the Soviet Union expanded scientific institutions in Primorye, especially in the city of [[Vladivostok]]. Several large research institutions are located here, such as the Institute of Biology and Agriculture, the Pacific Institute of Bio-organic Chemistry, the Institute of Marine Biology, the Pacific Institute of Geography, the Pacific Oceanological Institute, as well as several Institutes affiliated with the [[Russian Academy of Science|Far Eastern Division of the Russian Academy of Science]].

By the early 1990s, once-small enterprises in the city had developed into large companies. Some of the most prominent include the [[Far Eastern Shipping Company|DVMP]] (FESCO) shipping company, the Dalmoreprodukt fishing company, Progress [[Arsenyev]] Aircraft Works, and Vostok Mining. Commercial fishing plays an important part in the economy of the Primorye and includes firms like Vladivostok Trawling and Refrigerating Fleet (VBTRF), the Active Marine Fisheries Base of [[Nakhodka]], and the Fishing and Marine Transport Fleet of Primorye. Numerous enterprises of the [[Defense industry of Russia|Russian military-industrial complex]] were also established in Primorye.

The [[Udege people]], led by [[Pavel Sulyandziga]], are trying to gain control over their traditional territories along the [[Bikin River]] and in particular a [[Territory of Traditional Natural Resource Use]] of federal status.<ref name=cerd/>

==Politics==
[[File:Здание краевой администрации («Белый дом»), Владивосток, Светланская, 22, 2011-06-14.JPG|thumb|Krai Administration Building]]

During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Primorsky CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). After 1991, the head of the Oblast administration and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

The Charter of Primorsky Krai is the fundamental law of the region. The [[Legislative Assembly of Primorsky Krai]] is the province's [[regional parliaments of Russia|regional]] standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as the guarantor of the observance of the krai Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].

[[File:John Deere Combine in Russia.jpg|thumb|Agriculture in Primorsky Krai]]
Primorsky Krai's economy, the most balanced in the Russian Far East,{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} is also the largest in absolute terms. Food production is the most important sector, represented mainly by [[fish processing]]. Annual catch exceeds two million [[tonne]]s, or one half of the Russian Far East total. Second is [[machine building]], where half of the output is geared toward the [[fishing industry]] and [[shipyard]]s. [[Defense industry of Russia|Defense]] is another important sector, producing naval vessels and military [[aircraft]]. The [[construction]] materials industry here provides for the whole Russian Far East. Lead smelting is conducted in [[Rudnaya Pristan]] on the coast.

The [[timber]] industry, though in [[recession]],{{when|date=October 2018}} is still second only to [[Khabarovsk Krai]]'s with an annual yield of about 3 million cubic meters of [[timber]]. Primorsky Krai is the largest [[coal]] producer in the Russian Far East and generates more [[electricity]] than any other Russian Far East administrative division, but power shortages are common. [[Agriculture]] is also important; the krai produces rice, milk, eggs, and vegetables.


The krai's proximity to [[Pacific Rim]] markets gives it an edge over most other Russian Far East administrative divisions in developing [[foreign trade]]. Major trade items are [[seafood]] products, timber products, and ferrous metals. Major trading partners are Japan, China, and South Korea.[[File:Дорога через посёлок Горные Ключи.JPG|thumb|Road through Gorniye Kluchi village]]The economy will be further diversified with the addition of as many as 8 government sanctioned casinos to be built in the Primorye Gambling Zone, which encompasses the entire Primorsky Krai.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcasinodirectory.com/russia|publisher=[World Casino Directory]|access-date=2015-02-22|title=Russia Casino Gambling}}</ref> Primorsky Entertainment Resort City, under development by [[NagaCorp Ltd]]. of Phnom Penh, Kingdom of Cambodia, will be the largest.

Primorsky Krai's compact territory is well endowed with [[infrastructure]]. Its [[railway]] density is twice the Russian average.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Railroads connect it with China and North Korea. Vladivostok, the eastern terminus of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], was surpassed as a port by the nearby [[Nakhodka]]-[[Vostochny Port]] container, [[coal]] and [[timber]] terminals. Primorsky Krai-based shipping companies provide 80% of marine shipping services in the [[Russian Far East]]. All the krai's significant ports are now open to international shipping.

The largest companies in the region include Far-Eastern Energy Company, NNK-Bunker, Mazda Sollers, and [[Vostochny Port (company)|Vostochny Port]].<ref name="regioncompanies">{{cite web |title=Выписки ЕГРЮЛ и ЕГРИП, проверка контрагентов, ИНН и КПП организаций, реквизиты ИП и ООО |url=https://sbis.ru/contragents?p=companies |website=СБИС |access-date=20 October 2018 |language=ru}}</ref>

==Natural resources==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}

===Coal===
More than 100 deposits of [[coal]] are known in Primorsky Krai. The commercial deposits of coal are connected to the Partizansky and Razdolnensky coal basins, the Podgorodnensky deposit, the Uglovsky basin, and the Shkotovsky, Pavlovsky, Bikinsky, Rettikhovsky, and Suputinsky deposits.

'''Partizansky Basin''': The city of [[Partizansk]] is located in the southern part of the basin. The total area of the basin is {{convert|6,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The basin has been known since the 19th century and has been explored since 1902. Five regions—Staropartizansky, Melnikovsky, Belopadinsky, Molchanovsky, and [[Sergeyevka, Partizansky District|Sergeyevsky]]—are within the limits of the basin. The coal is [[anthracite|anthracite coal]]. By the output of volatile substances and caking ability, rich coals prevail. The reserves of coal in the basin total 193.6 million [[tonne]]s. The deposits are maintained by the mines of the Partizanskugol Association. A coal-mining factory also operates in this area.

'''Razdolnensky Basin''': The total area of this basin is about {{convert|4,500|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The basin is located to the north and the west of the city of [[Ussuriysk]]. The basin includes the following deposits: Ussuriysky, Lipovetsky, Verkhne-Razdolnensky, Konstantinovsky, and Alekseye-Nikolsky. The deposits were prospected as early as 1868. The mining of coal has been conducted since 1909. By the output of volatile substances and coking ability, long-flame coals prevail. The reserves of coal in the basin total of 66.7 million tons. The deposits are maintained by the mines and the open-pit coal mines of the Lipovetskoye Mine Administration.
