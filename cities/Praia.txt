'''Praia''' ({{IPA|pt|ˈpɾajɐ}}, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for "beach") is the capital and largest city of [[Cape Verde]].<ref name=yearbook>[http://ine.cv/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/statistical-yearbook-cv-2015_en.pdf Cape Verde, Statistical Yearbook 2015], [[Instituto Nacional de Estatística (Cape Verde)|Instituto Nacional de Estatística]]</ref> Located on the southern coast of [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago island]], within the [[Sotavento Islands]] group, the city is the seat of the [[Praia, Cape Verde (municipality)|Praia Municipality]]. Praia is the political, economic and cultural center of Cape Verde.

==History==
[[File:Battle_of_Porto_Praya.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of Praia during the 1781 [[Battle of Porto Praya]].]]
[[File:BARROW(1806) p098 PORTO PRAYA, ISLAND OF ST.JAGO (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Praia, depicted in 1806.]]  
The island of Santiago was discovered by [[António da Noli]] in 1460.<ref name=gomes>[http://hdl.handle.net/11328/594 Valor simbólico do centro histórico da Praia], Lourenço Conceição Gomes, Universidade Portucalense, 2008</ref>{{rp|73}} The first settlement on the island was Ribeira Grande ([[Cidade Velha]]). The village ''Praia de Santa Maria'' was first mentioned around 1615 and grew near the natural [[Praia Harbor|harbour]].<ref>Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 244</ref> The ports of Santiago were important ports of call for ships sailing between Portugal and the Portuguese colonies in Africa and South America. Between the end of the 16th century and the end of the 18th century, both Ribeira Grande and Praia suffered many pirate attacks, including those by [[Francis Drake]] ([[Capture of Santiago (1585)|1585]]) and [[Jacques Cassard]] ([[Cassard expedition|1712]]).<ref name=gomes/>{{rp|195}}

Due to its strategic position on a plateau it had better protection against pirate attacks, which gave it a large advantage over the older city of Ribeira Grande ([[Cidade Velha]]). It gradually superseded Cidade Velha to become the most important settlement of Cape Verde, and became the capital of Cape Verde in 1770.<ref name=unesco>{{Cite web|title=Centre historique de Praia|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/6103/|access-date=2023-02-19|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|language=fr|date=2016}}</ref> The naval [[battle of Porto Praya]] took place at [[Praia Harbour]] on 16 April 1781, as Portugal was neutral, it involved Great Britain and France and ended in a tactical draw and French strategic victory. Praia was the first stop of [[Charles Darwin]]'s voyage with {{HMS|Beagle}} in 1832.<ref>

Beagle round the world/Chapter 1|Journal of researches into the natural history and geology of the countries visited during the voyage of H.M.S. Beagle round the world – Chapter 1 at Wikisource, top part]]</ref>

In the course of the 19th century, the ''[[Plateau (Praia)|Plateau]]'' was completely redeveloped with streets according to a [[grid plan]], lined with grand colonial buildings and mansions.<ref name=unesco/><ref>[http://www.portaldoconhecimento.gov.cv/bitstream/10961/2407/1/monografia%20Domigas%20de%20Pina.pdf Antigas residências senhoriais do Centro Histórico da Praia], Domingas Andrade Silva Barbosa de Pina, [[University of Cape Verde|Universidade de Cabo Verde]], 2009</ref> Praia officially became a city (''cidade'') in 1858, which secured its status as the capital of Cape Verde, concentrating political, religious and economic roles.<ref name=gomes/>{{rp|55}} In the early 1920s, the population was around 21,000.<ref>{{cite book|last=Habbel|first=Josef|title=Habbels Konversationslexikon|volume=3|page=1043|place=Regensburg|year=1925}}</ref>

As in other parts of the archipelago, resistance against Portuguese rule rose in the 1950s. There was no open independence war like in [[Guinea-Bissau War of Independence|Guinea-Bissau]]; after the 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]] in Portugal and the resulting end of the [[Portuguese Colonial War]], Cape Verde declared independence in July 1975. After independence, Praia underwent a demographic boom, receiving migrating movements from all the islands. As a result, 56% of the entire population of Cape Verde resides in Santiago; and 29% in the Municipality of Praia alone. Its estimated population has reached 151,436 (2015).<ref name=yearbook/>{{rp|36}} On 28 June 1985, Praia became member of UCCLA, the Union of Luso – Afro-Americo-Asiatic Capital Cities, an international organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cm-lisboa.pt/investir/relacoes-economicas-internacionais/uccla|title=Site of the City of Lisbon: UCCLA|publisher=City of Lisbon|language=pt|access-date=11 October 2016}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Praia, Cape Verde Astronaut Imagery.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Praia.]]
Geographically, Praia may be described as a set of [[plateau]]s and their surrounding [[valley]]s. These plateaus generally have the name ''achada'' (Achada de Santo António, Achada de São Filipe, Achada Eugénio Lima, Achada Grande, Achadinha, etc. — ''achada'' being a Portuguese word to designate a volcanic plateau), but the central one is called [[Plateau (Praia)|Plateau]]. The urban settlement is made mostly on top of these plateaus and along the valleys. The [[Ilhéu de Santa Maria|islet of Santa Maria]] is in front of the beach bearing the same name.

For a long time, only the ''Plateau'' was considered to be the city, the other neighbourhoods being relegated to the condition of peripheral suburbs, in spite of always having a close relationship with the ''Plateau'' (people movements, goods and services exchanges, etc.). This is why only the ''Plateau'' previously had relatively well-developed urbanization with its own infra-structures. The remaining neighbourhoods developed in a more organic, chaotic way.

Only after independence did the ''Plateau'' merge with the other neighbourhoods to constitute what is now considered the City of Praia. The whole city was, at the time, equipped with adequate infrastructure. Urbanization begun immediately after independence and sought to expand north.

===Climate===
Praia has a [[desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: BWh) with a short [[wet season]] and a lengthy, very pronounced [[dry season]]. In fact, outside of the months of August, September and October, little precipitation falls on Praia. The city on average sees about {{convert|210|mm|in}} of rain per year. Since the coldest month is far above {{convert|18|C|F}} its temperature patterns resembles a [[tropical climate]], but lacks enough precipitation to be classified as such. Despite the fact that it has an arid climate, Praia seldom gets very hot or very cold, due to its oceanside location on Santiago Island. Temperatures are warm and constant with an average high temperature of {{convert|27|C|F|0}} and an average low temperature of {{convert|22|C|F|0}}.

==Education==
[[File:Praia-Escola_Grande.jpg|thumb|left|Escola Grande on [[Rua Serpa Pinto]].]]
[[File:Praia - Liceu (cropped).JPG|thumb|right|[[Liceu Domingos Ramos]].]]
The city of Praia is home to the first primary school in the archipelago, originally known as the ''Escola Central'' (today known as the ''Escola Grande''). For much time it was the only primary school in Praia. At the beginning of the 1960s, other primary schools began to be built in neighbourhoods around the Plateau and in other localities on the island.

Praia was also the first site in Cape Verde with a secondary education institution with the creation of the ''Liceu Nacional'' in 1861. However, the Portuguese authorities were not interested in implementing secondary education in Cape Verde and the school failed as a result; secondary education became, afterwards, the role of the ''Seminário de Ribeira Brava'' on the island of São Nicolau, and later of the lyceum in Mindelo.

In 1960, Praia again had secondary education, first with a facility on 12 September Plaza and later in its own building. With the expansion of education in Cape Verde in the 1990s, buildings dedicated to education were constructed in Cape Verde, and Praia in 2016 had 12 secondary education schools.

International schools:
* [[École Internationale Les Alizés]] (French school)
* Colégio Internacional – Cabo Verde (Portuguese school)<ref>"[http://www.dgae.mec.pt/web/14650/cabo-verde ESCOLAS COM CURRÍCULO PORTUGUÊS EM CABO VERDE]" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111526/http://www.dgae.mec.pt/web/14650/cabo-verde Archive]). Direção de Serviços de Ensino e Escolas Portuguesas no Estrangeiro (DSEEPE) of the [[Ministry of Education (Portugal)|Portuguese Education Ministry]]. Retrieved on 27 October 2015.</ref>

For higher education, there are the [[Universidade de Santiago]], ''Instituto Superior de Ciencias Juridícas e Sociais'', ''Instituto Superior de Ciencias Económicas e Empresariais'', [[Jean Piaget University of Cape Verde]], and [[University of Cape Verde]].

Praia is also home to the [[National Library of Cape Verde|National Library]] and the [[Arquivo Histórico Nacional (Cape Verde)|National Archives Building]] or the ANCV.

==Economy==
[[File:Praia coast Cape Verde.jpg|thumb|right|Tourism is an important contributor to Praia's economy]]
The principal economic activities of Praia belong to the tertiary sector. Beyond activities related to administration and governance (local and national), there are extensive commerce, services (health care, education, tourism, restaurants and hotels, public functions, etc.), and other activities of a liberal character.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia
|title=Praia  |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Praia|access-date=2023-02-19|language=en|date=2015}}</ref>

Being the nation's capital as well as the economic hub, Praia is one of the most economically viable cities in the Cape Verde archipelago. About one third (1/3) of the city's population lives below the poverty line today (2014). The gross metropolitan product for the city is about 39% of the country's GDP, translating into US$4764 income per capita.

==Transport ==
[[File:Praia International Airport.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nelson Mandela International Airport|Praia International Airport]].]]
The city is served by [[Nelson Mandela International Airport]] and [[Cabo Verde Airlines]], both having headquarters in Praia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.flytacv.com/spip.php?page=contact&id_article=68#sommaire_1|title=TACV Cabo Verde Airlines|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009231137/http://www.flytacv.com/spip.php?page=contact&id_article=68#sommaire_1 |archive-date=9 October 2009 }}</ref> It has the nation's second most used port, [[Praia Harbor]], with a ferry terminal linking to other islands, direct ferry routes are [[Maio, Cape Verde|Maio]], [[Fogo, Cape Verde|Fogo]] and [[São Vicente, Cape Verde|São Vicente]]. The port is managed by the national port authority [[ENAPOR]]. The port was reconstructed and expanded in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enapor.cv/web/guest/porto-da-praia|title=Information about the port|publisher=[[ENAPOR]]|language=pt|access-date=23 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219012115/http://www.enapor.cv/web/guest/porto-da-praia|archive-date=19 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Praia has a [[dual carriageway]] [[ring road]], the ''Circular da Praia'' (EN1-ST06), which is connected with the main national roads to the north ([[EN1-ST01]]) and the west ([[EN1-ST05]]) of the island. The main roads inside the city are ''Avenida Grão Ducado de Luxemburgo'' (from the centre to the west), [[Avenida Amílcar Cabral]] (in ''Plateau'') and [[Avenida Cidade de Lisboa]].

===Public transport===
Public transport within the city of Praia is provided by the company SolAtlântico. There are 12 city bus lines. Intercity [[share taxi]]s for other cities on the island of Santiago depart from the Sucupira terminal in the city centre, which was opened in May 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://noticias.sapo.cv/economia/artigos/santiago-condutores-de-hiace-satisfeitos-com-o-terminal-da-praia| title =Santiago: Condutores de hiace satisfeitos com o terminal da Praia |work=SAPO Notícias|date=3 July 2018}}</ref> In 2015 a project called EcobusCV started running a fleet of dual fuel waste vegetable oil / diesel minibuses between Praia and Assomada.
