==Overview==
[[File:Qena mosque.jpg|thumb|right|Qena Mosque]]
This provincial capital is located about 95&nbsp;km from [[El Balyana]] and 63&nbsp;km north of [[Luxor]]. It is most famous for its proximity to the ruins of [[Dendara]]. It owes its modern prosperity to the opening of the [[Wadi Qena]] towards the [[Red Sea]], which is a major traffic route between Upper Egypt and the Red Sea. Tourists traveling between Luxor and the Red Sea will assuredly pass through this city since there is only one good road connection. Qena is noted for its pottery. Qena is also known for its beautiful huge mountains and green nature.

[[South Valley University]] has a campus in Qena.<ref>{{Cite web |title=TISC Directory: Egypt - Qena (TICO- South Valley University) |url=https://www.wipo.int/tisc/en/search/details.jsp?id=10024 |access-date=2023-03-09 |website=www.wipo.int |language=en}}</ref>

Qena is a large market town on the River [[Nile]] situated next to the famous Greco-Roman temples of [[Dendera]]. Also on the Nile, Luxor is a long-time tourist hotspot that in large part attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors because of its temples, tombs and location on the site of the ancient capital of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. Ancient Thebes is now a UNESCO World Heritage site.

Qena has one of the highest concentration of Coptic Christians in Egypt (approximately 35% of the total population).

==Transportation==
Qena has a network of streets, roads and highways with greenery and flowered pavements. From the city there is a road that crosses the Eastern Desert to port [[Safaga]] on the Red Sea.

The [[United States Air Force]] conducted classified operations from Wadi Qena airfield from the 1970s to the 1990s, under the code names Coronet Scabbard, Coronel Aspen, Coronet Drake, and Coronet Mallard.<ref>[[William Arkin]], Code Names, 325.</ref> The 4401st Combat Support Squadron (Provisional) maintained a near-constant [[CENTAF]] presence there. Part of these operations probably included [[Lockheed MC-130]] flights during the [[Desert One]] rescue attempts for the U.S. hostages in Tehran in the late 1970s.<ref>Thigpen, Col. Jerry L. (2001).
