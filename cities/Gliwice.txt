'''Gliwice''' ({{IPA|pl|ɡliˈvit͡sɛ|lang|Pl-Gliwice.ogg}}; {{langx|szl|Gliwicy}}) is a [[city]] in [[Upper Silesia]], in southern [[Poland]]. The city is located in the [[Silesian Highlands]], on the [[Kłodnica]] river (a tributary of the [[Oder River|Oder]]). It lies approximately 25&nbsp;km west from [[Katowice]], the regional capital of the [[Silesian Voivodeship]].

Gliwice is the westernmost city of the [[Metropolis GZM]], a conurbation of 2.0 million people, and is the third-largest city of this area, with 175,102 permanent residents as of 2021.<ref name="population" /> It also lies within the larger [[Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area]] which has a population of about 5.3 million people and spans across most of eastern Upper Silesia, western [[Lesser Poland]] and the [[Moravian-Silesian Region]] in the [[Czech Republic]]. Gliwice is bordered by three other cities and towns of the metropolitan area: [[Zabrze]], [[Knurów]] and [[Pyskowice]]. It is one of the major [[college town]]s in Poland, thanks to the [[Silesian University of Technology]], which was founded in 1945 by academics of [[Lviv Polytechnic|Lwów University of Technology]]. Over 20,000 people study in Gliwice.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polsl.pl/en/Pages/About_us.aspx|title=About us|website=www.polsl.pl|language=pl|access-date=2018-10-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007223320/https://www.polsl.pl/en/Pages/About_us.aspx|archive-date=2018-10-07|url-status=live}}</ref> Gliwice is an important industrial center of Poland. Following an [[economic transformation]] in the 1990s, Gliwice shifted from [[Steel mill|steelworks]] and [[coal mining]] to [[Automotive industry|automotive]] and [[machine industry]].

Founded in the 13th century, Gliwice is one of the oldest settlements in [[Upper Silesia]], with a preserved Old Town core. Gliwice's most historical structures include [[Old Saint Bartholomew church|St Bartholomew's Church]] (15th century), [[Gliwice Castle]] and city walls (14th century), [[:pl:Kościół Trójcy Świętej w Gliwicach|Armenian Church]] (originally a hospital, 15th century) and [[:pl:Kościół Wszystkich Świętych w Gliwicach|All Saints Old Town Church]] (15th century). Gliwice is also known for its [[Gliwice Radio Tower|Radio Tower]], where [[Gleiwitz incident]] happened shortly before the outbreak of [[World War II]] and which is thought to be the world's tallest wooden construction,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muzeum.gliwice.pl/radio_station/|title=Radio Station Gliwice - Muzeum w Gliwicach|date=22 February 2013|access-date=1 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201144805/http://www.muzeum.gliwice.pl/radio_station/|archive-date=1 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> as well as Weichmann Textile House, one of the first buildings designed by world-renowned architect [[Erich Mendelsohn]].

===Early history===
[[File:Gliwice, kościół św. Bartłomieja, widok od pd-zach. (2).JPG|thumb|left|Medieval [[Fortified church|fortified]] [[Old Saint Bartholomew church]], one of the oldest structures of Gliwice]]
Gliwice was first mentioned as a town in 1276, however, it was granted [[town rights]] earlier by Duke [[Władysław Opolski]] of the [[Piast dynasty]].<ref name=dzieje>{{cite web|url=https://gliwice.eu/miasto/o-gliwicach/dzieje-miasta|title=Dzieje miasta|website=Miasto Gliwice|author=Edward Wieczorek|access-date=15 March 2020|language=pl|archive-date=1 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801023849/https://gliwice.eu/miasto/o-gliwicach/dzieje-miasta|url-status=live}}</ref> It was located on a [[trade route]] connecting [[Kraków]] and [[Wrocław]] and was part of various [[Piast dynasty|Piast]]-ruled duchies of [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty#Fragmentation of the realm (1138–1320)|fragmented Poland]]: [[Duchy of Opole|Opole]] until 1281, [[Duchy of Bytom|Bytom]] until 1322, from 1322 to 1342 Gliwice was a capital of an eponymous duchy, afterwards again part of the Duchy of Bytom until 1354, later it was also ruled by other regional Polish Piast dukes until 1532,<ref name=dzieje/> although in 1335 it fell under the suzerainty of the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian Crown]], passing with that crown under suzerainty of the [[Austria]]n [[Habsburg]]s in 1526.

According to 14th-century writers, the town seemed defensive in character, when under rule of [[Siemowit of Bytom]].<ref name = history>{{Cite web |url=http://www.um.gliwice.pl/index.php?id=123%2F1 |title=Official website of Gliwice - Dzieje miasta |access-date=2019-09-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071211/http://www.um.gliwice.pl/index.php?id=123%2F1 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the [[Middle Ages]] the city prospered mainly due to trade and crafts, especially [[brewing]].<ref name=dzieje/>

On 17 April 1433, Gliwice was captured by the [[Duchy of Głogówek and Prudnik|Duke]] [[Bolko V the Hussite|Bolko V]], who joined the [[Hussites]] after they captured [[Prudnik]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dominiak|first=Wojciech|title=Prudnik w średniowieczu: studia nad początkami miasta|publisher=Muzeum Ziemi Prudnickiej|year=2016|isbn=978-83-63260-62-0|location=Prudnik}}</ref>

===Early Modern Age===
[[File:Gliwice Feb 2014 038.JPG|thumb|An 1863 Polish plaque at the Town Hall commemorating Polish King [[John III Sobieski]] to 200th anniversary of the [[Battle of Vienna]]]]
After the dissolution of the [[Duchy of Opole and Racibórz]] in 1532, it was incorporated as Gleiwitz into the [[Habsburg monarchy]]. Because of the vast expenses incurred by the Habsburg monarchy during their [[Ottoman wars in Europe|16th century wars]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]], Gleiwitz was [[lease]]d to Friedrich Zettritz for the amount of 14,000 [[thaler]]s. Although the original lease was for a duration of 18 years, it was renewed in 1580 for 10 years and in 1589 for an additional 18 years. Around 1612, the Reformed Franciscans came from [[Kraków]], and then their monastery and Holy Cross Church were built.<ref name=db>{{cite web|url=https://zabytek.pl/pl/obiekty/gliwice-zespol-klasztorny-reformatow-ob-redemptorystow|title=Zespół klasztorny reformatów, ob. redemptorystów|website=Zabytek.pl|author=Dorota Bajowska|accessdate=25 July 2021|language=pl|archive-date=25 July 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210725075918/https://zabytek.pl/pl/obiekty/gliwice-zespol-klasztorny-reformatow-ob-redemptorystow|url-status=live}}</ref> The city was besieged or captured by various armies during the [[Thirty Years' War]].<ref name=dzieje/> In 1645 along with the Duchy of Opole and Racibórz it returned to Poland under the [[House of Vasa]], and in 1666 it fell to Austria again. In 1683 Polish King [[John III Sobieski]] stopped in the city before the [[Battle of Vienna]].<ref name=dzieje/> In the 17th and 18th century, the city's economy switched from trading and brewing beer to clothmaking, which collapsed after the 18th-century [[Silesian Wars]].<ref name=dzieje/>

During the mid 18th century [[Silesian Wars]], Gleiwitz was taken from the Habsburg monarchy by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] along with the majority of Silesia. After the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Gleiwitz was administered in the [[Districts of Prussia|Prussian district]] of Tost-Gleiwitz within the [[Province of Silesia]] in 1816. The city was incorporated with Prussia into the [[German Empire]] in 1871 during the [[unification of Germany]]. In 1897 Gleiwitz became its own Stadtkreis, or urban district.

===Industrialization===
The first coke-fired [[blast furnace]] on the European continent was constructed in Gleiwitz in 1796 under the direction of [[John Baildon]]. Gleiwitz began to develop into a major city through [[industrialization]] during the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}} The town's [[ironworks]] fostered the growth of other industrial fields in the area. The city's population in 1875 was 14,156. However, during the late 19th century Gleiwitz had: 14 [[Distillation|distilleries]], 2 [[brewery|breweries]], 5 [[Mill (grinding)|mills]], 7 [[brick]] [[Factory|factories]], 3 [[sawmill]]s, a [[Roof shingle|shingle]] factory, 8 [[chalk]] factories and 2 [[Glassblowing|glassworks]].

Other features of the 19th century industrialized Gleiwitz were a [[gasworks]], a [[Metallurgical furnace|furnace]] factory, a beer [[bottling company]], and a plant for asphalt and paste. Economically, Gleiwitz opened several [[bank]]s, [[Savings and loan association]]s, and [[Bond (finance)|bond]] centers. Its [[tram]] system was completed in 1892, while its [[theater]] was opened in 1899; until [[World War II]], Gleiwitz' theatre featured actors from throughout Europe and was one of the most famous theatres in the whole of [[Germany]]. Despite [[Germanisation of Poles during the Partitions|Germanisation]] policies, the [[Polish people|Poles]] established various Polish organizations, including the [[Polish Sokół movement|"Sokół" Polish Gymnastic Society]], and published local Polish newspapers.<ref name=dzieje/>
[[File:Wappen von Gleiwitz.svg|thumb|upright|Coat of arms of Gleiwitz]]

===20th century===
According to the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]], Gleiwitz's population in 1905 was 61,324. By 1911, it had two [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and four [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] churches, a [[synagogue]], a mining school, a [[convent]], a [[hospital]], two [[orphanage]]s, and a [[barracks]]. Gleiwitz was the center of the [[mining]] industry of [[Upper Silesia]]. It possessed a royal [[foundry]], with which were connected machine factories and boiler works. Other industrialized areas of the city had other foundries, meal mills, and factories producing wire, gas pipes, cement, and paper.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}
[[File:Ballestremsche Verwaltung Gleiwitz.jpg|thumb|left|The present Administrative Court building in the 1920s]]
After the end of [[World War I]], clashes between [[Polish people|Poles]] and [[Germans]] occurred during the [[Silesian Uprisings|Polish insurrections]] in Silesia. Some ethnically Polish inhabitants of Upper Silesia wanted to incorporate the city into the [[Second Polish Republic]], which just regained independence. On 1 May 1919, a Polish rally was held in Gliwice.<ref name="ips">{{cite web|url=https://www.ipsb.nina.gov.pl/a/biografia/wincenty-styczynski|title=Wincenty Styczyński|website=Internetowy Polski Słownik Biograficzny|access-date=15 March 2020|language=pl|archive-date=1 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801030911/https://www.ipsb.nina.gov.pl/a/biografia/wincenty-styczynski|url-status=live}}</ref> Seeking a peaceful solution to the conflict, the [[League of Nations]] held a [[referendum|plebiscite]] on 20 March 1921 to determine which country the city should belong to. In Gleiwitz, 32,029 votes (78.7% of given votes) were for remaining in Germany, Poland received 8,558 (21.0%) votes, and 113 (0.3%) votes were declared invalid. The total voter turnout was listed as 97.0%. This prompted another insurrection by Poles. The League of Nations determined that three Silesian cities: Gleiwitz (Gliwice), [[Zabrze|Hindenburg (Zabrze)]] and [[Bytom|Beuthen (Bytom)]] would remain in Germany, and the eastern part of [[Upper Silesia]] with its main city of [[Katowice|Katowice (Kattowitz)]] would join restored Poland. After delimiting the border in Upper Silesia in 1921, Gliwice found itself in Germany, but near the border with [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] &ndash; the nearby [[Knurów]] was already in Poland.

During the [[interbellum]] the city witnessed not only [[Anti-Polish sentiment|anti-Polish]], but also [[Francophobia|anti-French]] incidents and violence by the Germans. In 1920, local Polish doctor and city [[councillor]] {{interlanguage link|Wincenty Styczyński|pl}}, protested against the German refusal to treat [[French people|French]] soldiers stationed in the city.<ref name="ips"/> In January 1922, he himself treated French soldiers shot in the city.<ref name="ips" /> On 9 April 1922, 17 Frenchmen died in an explosion during the liquidation of a German militia weapons warehouse in the present-day [[Sośnica, Gliwice|Sośnica]] district.<ref name="ips"/> Styczyński, who defended the rights of local Poles and protested against German acts of violence against Poles, was himself murdered by a German radical/militant on 18 April 1922.<ref name="ips" /> Nevertheless, various Polish organizations and enterprises still operated in the city in the interbellum, including a local branch of the [[Union of Poles in Germany]], Polish banks and a [[scout troop]].{{sfn|Cygański|1984|pp=24, 31, 33}}

On 9 June 1933, Gliwice was the site of the first conference of the Nazi anti-Polish organization [[Bund Deutscher Osten]] in Upper Silesia.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|Węcki|2010|p=49}} In a secret ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' report from 1934, Gliwice was named one of the main centers of the Polish movement in western Upper Silesia.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|Węcki|2010|p=60}} Polish activists were increasingly persecuted starting in 1937.{{sfn|Cygański|1984|p=24}}

During early 1940, the advanced [[shaped charge]] explosive developed for the attack on [[Fort Ében-Émael]] as part of the Blitzkreig attack on the [[Maginot Line]] on May 10, 1940 were tested at places in Gleiwitz to ensure secrecy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lucas|first=James|year=2022|title=Storming Eagles |language=En|location=London|publisher=Canelo|page=23|isbn=978-1-80032-985-0}}</ref>

The  [[Gleiwitz incident]] was a false-flag attack on a radio station in Gleiwitz on 31 August 1939, staged by the German secret police, which served as a pretext, devised by [[Reinhard Heydrich]] under orders from Hitler, for [[Nazi Germany]] to [[Invasion of Poland|invade Poland]], and which marked the start of the [[Second World War]]. Shortly after the outbreak of the war, on 4 September 1939, the ''[[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe I]]'' entered the city to commit [[Nazi crimes against the Polish nation|atrocities against Poles]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wardzyńska|first=Maria|year=2009|title=Był rok 1939.

On 24 January 1945, Gliwice was occupied by the [[Red Army]]. In February 1945, the Soviets carried out deportations of local men to Soviet mines.<ref name=ig/> Under borders changes dictated by the Soviet Union at the [[Potsdam Conference]], Gliwice fell inside Poland's new borders after Germany's defeat in the war. It was incorporated into Poland's [[Silesian Voivodeship]] on 18 March 1945, after almost 300 years of being outside of Polish rule.

In 1956, Gliwice was the site of a manifestation of solidarity with the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], and local Poles raised funds and donated blood for the Hungarian insurgents (see also ''[[Hungary–Poland relations]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gliwice.gosc.pl/gal/pokaz/1811855.Tablica-pamiatkowa-na-gliwickim-rynku/|title=Tablica pamiątkowa na gliwickim rynku|date=12 December 2013|access-date=29 November 2023|language=pl|archive-date=14 August 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220814191510/https://gliwice.gosc.pl/gal/pokaz/1811855.Tablica-pamiatkowa-na-gliwickim-rynku|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Demographics==

===Population development===
The earliest population estimate of Gliwice from 1880, gives 1,159 people in 1750.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://dir.icm.edu.pl/pl/Slownik_geograficzny/Tom_II/593|title=Słownik geograficzny Królestwa Polskiego i innych krajów słowiańskich, Tom II - wynik wyszukiwania - DIR|website=dir.icm.edu.pl|language=pl|access-date=2018-10-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220160715/http://dir.icm.edu.pl/pl/Slownik_geograficzny/Tom_II/593|archive-date=2013-12-20|url-status=live}}</ref> The same source cites population to have been 2,990 in 1810, 6,415 in 1838, and 10,923 in 1861. A census from 1858 reported the following ethnic makeup: 7,060 - [[Germans|German]], 3,566 - [[Polish people|Polish]], 11 - [[Moravians|Moravian]], 1 - [[Czechs|Czech]]. Since the [[Industrial Revolution]], Gliwice saw rapid economic growth which fuelled fast population increase. In 1890, Gliwice had 19,667 inhabitants, and this number has increased over twofold over the next 10 years to 52,362 in 1900.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.verwaltungsgeschichte.de:80/gleiwitz.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208111950/http://www.verwaltungsgeschichte.de/gleiwitz.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-12-08|title=Deutsche Verwaltungsgeschichte Schlesien, Kreis Gleiwitz|date=2017-12-08|access-date=2018-10-07}}</ref> Gliwice gained its status of a large city (''[[:de:Großstadt|Großstadt]]'' in German) in 1927, when population reached 102,452 people.{{cn|date=June 2024}}

In 1945, with the approaching Red Army, a significant number of residents were either evacuated or fled the city at their own discretion. Following the [[Yalta Conference]], Gliwice, along most of [[Silesia]], was incorporated into [[Polish People's Republic|communist Poland]], and the remaining German population was [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|expelled]]. Ethnic Poles, some of them themselves [[Polish population transfers (1944–1946)|expelled]] from [[Kresy|the Polish Kresy]] (which were incorporated into [[Soviet Union]]), started to settle down in Gliwice. Population estimates reached their pre-war levels in 1950, at 119,968 people. Gliwice's population peaked in 1988 at 223,403 inhabitants.{{cn|date=June 2024}}

As of December 31, 2016, Gliwice's population stood at 182,156 people, a decrease of 1,236 over the previous year. Gliwice faces a continuous population decline since 1988, which is credited to very low birth rates (exceeded by death rates) and suburbanisation.{{cn|date=June 2024}}

===Nationality, ethnicity and language===
Historically, Gliwice was ethnically diverse, initially inhabited by [[Polish people|Poles]], later it had a [[Germans|German]] majority as a result of German [[Drang nach Osten|colonization]], with a significant autochthonous Polish minority. In the [[Upper Silesia plebiscite|Upper Silesian Plebiscite]] in 1921, 78.9 percent of voters opted for Germany (however 15.1 percent of the vote in Gliwice was cast by non-residents, who are believed to overwhelmingly vote for Germany across the region). After Germany's defeat in World War II, the Germans either fled or were displaced to Allied-occupied Germany in accordance with the [[Potsdam Agreement]]. Polish inhabitants remained in Gliwice, and were joined by Poles [[Polish population transfers (1944–1946)|displaced]] from former [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union]], including the city of [[Lviv|Lwów]] (Lviv),<ref name=ig>{{Cite web |url=https://infogliwice.pl/historia-gliwic/ |language=pl |title=Historia Gliwic |website=infogliwice.pl |access-date=9 December 2022 |archive-date=9 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221209113039/https://infogliwice.pl/historia-gliwic/ |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Volhynia]], [[Polesie]], the [[Vilnius|Wilno]] region (Vilnius region) and the [[Grodno]] region.

====Jews in Gliwice====
Gliwice's Jewish population reached its height in 1929 at approximately 2,200 people, but started to decline in the late 1930s, as the [[Nazi Party]] gained power in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], of which Gliwice was then a part.

*The Weichmann Textile House was built during the Summers of 1921 and 1922 . It was never referred to as Weichmann Textile House from its completion in Summer 1922 until its closing in 1943. Rather it was founded under the name Seidenhaus Weichmann (“[[Silk]] House Weichmann) by a Jewish [[World War I|WWI]] veteran, Erwin Weichmann(1891–1976), who had been awarded the [[Iron Cross|Iron Cross 2nd Class]] by Germany. Erwin Weichmann a long time friend of [[Erich Mendelsohn]], commissioned the [[architect]] to design Seidenhaus Weichmann. Today a monument can be seen near the entrance to the bank, that now occupies the building. Seidenhaus Weichmann is a two-floor structure. The second floor was initially a bachelor's pad for Erwin Weichmann, as he did not marry until 1930. In 1936 the newly created [[Nuremberg Laws]] forced Erwin Weichmann to sell Seidenhaus Weichmann and move temporarily to Hindenberg ([[Zabrze]]) before emigrating to the [[United States]] in July 1938. The individual, who had purchased Seidenhaus Weichmann in 1936, never saw a profit, as the economic strain of [[World War II|WWII]] severely reduced the market demand for nonessentials, which included the fine imported silks of sold by Seidenhaus Weichmann. Then in 1943, the purchaser of Seidenhaus was killed in an [[Allied bombing of Germany|Allied bombing raid]], which marked the end of Seidenhaus Weichmann.
