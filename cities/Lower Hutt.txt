'''Lower Hutt''' ({{lang-mi|Te Awa Kairangi ki Tai}})<ref>https://www.huttvalleynz.com/visit/whats-in-a-name-hutt-valleys-origin/ huttvalleynz, 'What's in a name: Hutt Valley's origin'</ref> is a [[list of cities in New Zealand|city]] in the [[Wellington Region]] of New Zealand. Administered by the [[Hutt City Council]], it is one of the four cities that constitute the [[Wellington#Wellington metropolitan area|Wellington metropolitan area]].

If considered a city it is New Zealand's [[List of cities in New Zealand|sixth most populous]], with a population of {{NZ population data 2018| Lower Hutt city|y}}.<ref name="NZ_population_data_2018"/> The total area administered by the council is {{convert|376.4|km2|sqmi|0|abbr= on}} around the lower half of the [[Hutt Valley]] and along the eastern shores of [[Wellington Harbour]], of which {{convert|78.54|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} is urban.<ref name="Area"/> It is separated from the city of Wellington by the harbour, and from [[Upper Hutt]] by the Taita Gorge.

Lower Hutt is unique among New Zealand cities, as the name of the council does not match the name of the city it governs. Special legislation<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/local/1991/0002/latest/whole.html |title=Lower Hutt City (Name of City Council) Act 1991|access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> has since 1991 given the council the name "Hutt City Council", while the name of the place itself remains "Lower Hutt City". This name has led to confusion, as Upper Hutt is administered by a separate city council, the Upper Hutt City Council. The entire Hutt Valley includes both Lower and Upper Hutt cities. Lower Hutt is also often simply called "the Hutt".

==History==
Before European settlement, thick forest covered most of the Hutt Valley, with areas of marshland close to the river's mouth. [[Māori people|Māori]] inhabited the shoreline, with a [[pā]] at each end of Petone beach.<ref name="history">{{cite web |title=Our history |url=http://www.huttcity.govt.nz/leisure--culture/archives-and-heritage/heritage/our-history/ |website=[[Hutt County Council]] |access-date=30 March 2021 |language=en}}</ref>

Māori welcomed the arrival of the [[New Zealand Company]] ship [[New Zealand Company ships#Tory|''Tory'']] in 1839, and [[William Wakefield]] (the company's agent) negotiated with some local chiefs to allow settlement. The first immigrant ship, the ''Aurora'', arrived on 22 January 1840, an event still commemorated every year on the Monday closest as [[Wellington Province#Anniversary Day|Wellington's Anniversary Day]]. A settlement, Britannia, grew up close to the mouth of the Hutt River ([[Te Awa Kairangi / Hutt River|Te Awa Kairangi]] in Māori language), and settlers set up New Zealand's first newspaper and bank.<ref name="history"/>

The city takes its name from the English name given to the river, named after one of the founding members, director and chairman of the New Zealand Company, Sir [[William Hutt (British MP)|William Hutt]]. The dual name of Hutt River Te Awa Kairangi has been used since 2010.<ref name="river">{{Cite web|url=https://gazette.govt.nz/notice/id/2010-ln6564|title=Notice of Proposals to Assign or Alter Place Names – 2010-ln6564 – New Zealand Gazette|website=gazette.govt.nz|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>

[[File:Christ Church Taita.JPG|thumb|left|[[Christ Church, Taita|Christ Church, Taitā]], built in 1853 – the oldest extant church in the Wellington region]]

Within weeks of settlement the Hutt River flooded, and in March 1840 the majority of Britannia settlers decided to move to [[Thorndon, New Zealand|Thorndon]], ({{as of | 2013 | lc = on}} in the heart of Wellington city), though some settlers remained at the north end of the harbour.<ref name="history"/> In the 1840s an area on the west bank of the Hutt River, in what is now [[Alicetown]], formed the village then known as Aglionby.<ref>{{cite book| last = Wakefield | first = Edward Jerningham | author-link = Edward Jerningham Wakefield | title = The Hand-book for New Zealand: Consisting of the Most Recent Information | url = https://archive.org/details/handbookfornewz00wakegoog | access-date = 5 June 2013 | year = 1848 | publisher = John W.

[...] On the same bank of the river, about half a mile lower down, is the village of Aglionby, which contains an excellent Tavern, with good stabling and other accommodation; a small building used as a Church and a school, a blacksmith's forge, and several shops, one or two good farm-houses, and numerous labourers' cottages.

In 1846 [[Hutt Valley Campaign|conflict arose between European settlers and Māori]], which led to armed conflict in the [[Hutt Valley Campaign]].<ref name="history"/>

The [[1855 Wairarapa earthquake]] (in the range of magnitude 8.1 to 8.3) raised part of the lower valley, allowing reclamation of land from swamp. The fault escarpment from the earthquake is still visible, notably at Hutt Central School.<ref name="history"/>

On New Year's Day 1859 the first permanent lighthouse to be built in New Zealand was lit at Pencarrow Head. New Zealand's only female lighthouse keeper, [[Mary Jane Bennett]], became the inaugural operator of the lighthouse.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.heritage.org.nz/places/places-to-visit/wellington-region/pencarrow-lighthouse |title = Pencarrow Lighthouse &#124; Wellington &#124; Places to Visit &#124; Places &#124; Heritage New Zealand}}</ref>

The railway line from central Wellington reached Lower Hutt station (subsequently [[Western Hutt railway station|Western Hutt]]) in April 1874, with the line running north up the west side of the Hutt River to Silverstream opening two years later.<ref name="history"/>

Before the Second World War of 1939–1945, urban settlement in the lower Hutt Valley concentrated mainly on [[Petone]], central Lower Hutt and Eastbourne, with a total population of 30,000. In 1927 the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Public Works Department]] completed the construction of a branch railway line to [[Waterloo railway station, Lower Hutt|Waterloo]] on the east side of the river; the route diverging from the main line between Lower Hutt and Petone. Two years later the railway workshops moved from Petone to a [[Hutt Workshops|new larger site off the new branch at Woburn]].

In the late 1940s new suburbs of [[State housing in New Zealand|state housing]] developed along the eastern side of the Hutt Valley, from [[Waiwhetū]] to [[Taitā, New Zealand|Taitā]] (then known as Taita), to alleviate nationwide housing shortages and to cater for the [[baby boom|booming population]]. Between 1946 and 1954 the railway line from Waterloo extended through these new suburbs to [[Haywards]], becoming the main line in 1954 when the existing main line between Haywards and Melling closed. By the end of the 1950s, Lower Hutt had a population of 80,000.

Neighbouring councils are [[Wellington City Council]] (adjoining to the west), [[Porirua]] City Council to the north, [[Upper Hutt]] City Council to the north-east and [[South Wairarapa District]] Council to the east. The boundaries of the Lower Hutt city local body have evolved from a series of amalgamations and boundary changes over the years.

The [[Hutt County Council]], established in 1877, covered the region from Wellington's south coast up to [[Waikanae]], excluding the [[Wellington City Council]] area.<ref name="history"/> As the region grew, urban parts of the Hutt County became autonomous boroughs: [[Petone]] in 1888, Lower Hutt in 1891, [[Eastbourne, New Zealand|Eastbourne]] in 1906, [[Johnsonville, New Zealand|Johnsonville]] in 1908, [[Upper Hutt]] in 1908, [[Porirua]] in 1962 and [[Kapiti Coast (district), New Zealand|Kapiti]] in 1974.<ref name="history"/> In 1941 Lower Hutt became a city.<ref name="history"/> It incorporated [[Normandale, New Zealand|Normandale]] in 1957.

In 1987–1989 the New Zealand Government forced local authorities to consolidate, which led to Lower Hutt amalgamating with the adjacent Boroughs of Petone and Eastbourne and with the [[Wainuiomata]] District (which had its independence for barely a year), and to the abolition of the Hutt County Council.

===National===
The area of Lower Hutt is covered by two [[New Zealand electorates|general electorates]] ([[Hutt South]] and [[Remutaka (New Zealand electorate)|Remutaka]]) and by two [[Māori electorates]] ([[Ikaroa-Rāwhiti]] in the north and [[Te Tai Tonga]] in the south).<ref>{{cite web |title=2020 General Election electorates {{!}} Vote NZ |url=https://vote.nz/maps/2020-general-election-electorates/ |website=Vote NZ |access-date=30 March 2021 |language=en-NZ}}</ref>

==Geography==
The city centres on the lower southern valley of the [[Hutt River, New Zealand|Hutt River]], to the northeast of the city of [[Wellington]]. The valley widens into a [[river delta|delta]] as the river nears its mouth, so the central urban area of the city forms a triangle with its longest side along the shoreline. In the upper reaches of the city the Western and Eastern Hutt Hills become closer, culminating in the Taitā Gorge at the northern end of Lower Hutt, separating the city from neighbouring Upper Hutt.<ref name="Geography">{{cite web |title=Hutt Landscape Study 2012 |url=http://www.gw.govt.nz/assets/council-publications/Hutt%20Landscape%20Study%202012.pdf |website=Wellington Region Local government {{!}} Greater Wellington Regional Council |access-date=30 March 2021 |date=April 2012}}</ref>

Lower Hutt includes the cluster of small settlements that extend down the eastern coast of [[Wellington Harbour]]. These include the two large [[township]]s of [[Wainuiomata]] and [[Eastbourne, New Zealand|Eastbourne]]. The city also includes a large area of sparsely-populated land to the east of the harbour, extending to Pencarrow Head and into the [[Remutaka Range]].<ref name="Geography"/> Lower Hutt's boundaries also include the islands in Wellington Harbour, the largest of which is [[Matiu / Somes Island]].<ref name="Geography"/>

===Climate===
Lower Hutt has a wet [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: '''Cfb'''), which is similar to nearby Wellington, with relatively warm summers and mild winters with the occasional storm.

===Te Awa Kairangi / Hutt River===
[[File:Te Awa Kairangi Hutt River Looking downstream.jpg|thumb|Te Awa Kairangi Hutt River Looking downstream]]
A single major aquifer dominates the lower Hutt Valley: the [[Te Awa Kairangi / Hutt River|river]], originally named Heretaunga, and since 2010 known as "Te Awa Kairangi / Hutt River".<ref name="Geography"/><ref name="history"/><ref name="river"/> ''Awakairangi'' in the [[Māori language]] means "river of food from the sky".

Lower Hutt occupies the lower regions of the [[floodplain|flood plain]] of the river, one of the most significant features of the city.<ref name="Geography"/> In the 20th century the Hutt River Board built [[stopbank]]s to contain the river,<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Hutt River = Te-Awa-kai-rangi: a modern history, 1840–1990 |last=Easther |first=John |date=1991 |publisher=Wellington Regional Council |others=Wellington Regional Council |isbn=0909016097 |location=Wellington |oclc=34915088}}</ref> but the threat of flooding from heavy rainfall persists. In 1985 the river burst its banks, and since then floods have been on a smaller scale. Smaller streams and storm-water drains have also caused occasional problems when rainfall exceeds average levels.

Much of the land adjacent to the river is protected as reserve by the City Council and managed by the [[Greater Wellington Regional Council]] to provide popular recreational areas.<ref name="Geography"/> From the river mouth, walking and cycling trails and grassed areas occur at various points along both sides of the river up the [[Hutt Valley]] to [[Te Mārua]], 28&nbsp;km further north in Upper Hutt.

With lower river-levels in mid-summer, [[algal bloom]]s have contributed to making slow-flowing areas anoxic. The Regional Council has cited the algal blooms as the cause of death of a small number of dogs swimming in the river, as well as of skin reactions in the case of swimmers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Frequently asked Questions |url=https://www.gw.govt.nz/toxic-algae-faqs/ |website=Greater Wellington Regional Council |access-date=30 March 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Tso |first1=Matthew |title=Toxic algae returns to Wairarapa and Hutt rivers as weather heats up and water levels drop |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/300200446/toxic-algae-returns-to-wairarapa-and-hutt-rivers-as-weather-heats-up-and-water-levels-drop |access-date=30 March 2021 |work=Stuff |date=7 January 2021 |language=en}}</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Gear Meat Company, Petone (21430987361).jpg|thumb|right|Early 1900s photo taken from Korokoro looking down on Petone and the Gear Meat Company]]
Historically, Petone, Seaview and Gracefield have been the main area for industry in the Wellington region, with industries including meat processing and freezing, motor vehicle assembly, and timber processing. As business have taken advantage of global manufacturing efficiencies, much of this large scale industry has changed to smaller design-led and medium-sized industries exporting to the world. Over the past 25 years service, distribution, and consumer-oriented sectors have increased. Lower Hutt remains the main location for light industrial activity in the Wellington Region.

Until post-war housing development took over, the central and northern areas of the city were largely market gardens.

In 2010 the lower reaches of the [[Waiwhetū Stream]] was cleaned up to remove toxins from decades of industry use. The channel was also widened to better protect against floods and native plantings and management has seen native waterlife and birds return to their habitat.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gw.govt.nz/public-excitement-over-waiwhetu-stream-clean-up/ |title=Public excitement over Waiwhetu Stream clean up |access-date=18 July 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170503061323/http://www.gw.govt.nz/public-excitement-over-waiwhetu-stream-clean-up/ |archive-date=3 May 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Petone's Jackson Street and neighbouring areas have seen a resurgence in to one of Wellington's most popular retail and hospitality area.

Lower Hutt has one of the greatest proportion of science, technology and high value manufacturing businesses in New Zealand. Crown research institute GNS Science and New Zealand's innovation centre and business accelerator [[Callaghan Innovation]] are based in Lower Hutt, along with over 800 research organisations in high-end manufacturing, research and technology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://huttcity.govt.nz/en/Our-City/Business-in-the-Hutt/ |title=Business in the Hutt |access-date=27 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803143202/http://www.huttcity.govt.nz/en/Our-City/Business-in-the-Hutt/ |archive-date=3 August 2012  }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=March 2022}}

[[File:Avalon television studios, Lower Hutt, NZ (cropped).JPG|thumb|right|Avalon TV Studios from Harcourt Werry Drive]]
The suburb of [[Avalon, New Zealand|Avalon]] was home to New Zealand's television industry from 1975 until the late 1980s. The [[Avalon, New Zealand#Avalon Studios|Avalon film and television studios]] were New Zealand's first purpose-built television studios, and is the largest television studio complex in Australasia. The studios were home to [[TV One (New Zealand)|Television One]] from 1975 to 1980, when it merged with [[South Pacific Television]] to form [[Television New Zealand]] (TVNZ). After 1989 most of TVNZ's operations moved to Auckland, and the studios were eventually sold off in 2012 to a consortium of Wellington investors.<ref name="Stuff.co.nz_4868116">{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/arts-life/4868116/The-rise-and-fall-of-Avalon |title=The rise and fall of Avalon |date=11 April 2011 |author=Tom Hunt and Paul Easton |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |access-date=1 July 2013}}</ref> Avalon continues to operate independently with seven film and television studios used as primarily as a feature film production base.

==Flora and fauna==
Hills to about 350&nbsp;m (1000&nbsp;ft) line both sides of the valley within the city limits. The western hills have been populated as residential areas, but the eastern side is protected and clad in native [[forest|bush and scrub]], and the ubiquitous [[gorse]] in areas that have been cleared as a result of scrub fires or earlier human activity.

Native birds are common, including the [[New Zealand pigeon]], [[tūī]], [[grey fantail]], [[silvereye]], [[shining cuckoo]] (in season), [[grey warbler]] and [[morepork]].
