According to the ''[[Book of Axum]]'', Axum's first capital, Mazaber, was built by Itiyopis, son of Cush.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWBPAQAAIAAJ|title=Africa Geoscience Review|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Rock View International|page=366|access-date=10 July 2017|archive-date=27 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230327025552/https://books.google.com/books?id=QWBPAQAAIAAJ|url-status=live}}</ref> The capital was later moved to [[Axum|Aksum]] in northern Ethiopia.

The Empire of Aksum, at its height, at times extended across most of present-day [[Eritrea]], Ethiopia, [[Djibouti]], Sudan, Yemen and Saudi Arabia. The capital city of the empire was [[Axum]], now in northern Ethiopia. Today a smaller community, the city of Axum was once a bustling metropolis and a cultural and economic hub. Two hills and two streams lie on the east and west expanses of the city; perhaps providing the initial impetus for settling this area. Along the hills and plain outside the city, the Aksumites had cemeteries with elaborate grave stones, which are called [[stelae]], or [[obelisk]]s. Other important cities included [[Yeha]], [[Hawulti-Melazo]], [[Matara, Eritrea|Matara]], [[Adulis]], and [[Qohaito]], the last three of which are now in Eritrea. By the reign of [[Endubis]] in the late 3rd century, Aksum had begun minting its own currency and was named by [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] as one of the four great powers of his time, along with [[History of China|China]] and the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] empires. It converted to [[Christianity]] in 325 or 328 under [[Ezana of Axum|King Ezana]] and was the first state to use the image of [[crucifix|the cross]] on its coins.<ref>{{cite web |title=Aksum |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/15 |website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |language=en |access-date=26 December 2019 |archive-date=28 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220828225403/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/15 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mountain Constantines: The Christianization of Aksum and Iberia1 |url=http://users.clas.ufl.edu/sterk/junsem/haas.pdf |website=users.clas.ufl.edu |access-date=10 July 2017 |archive-date=29 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329065343/http://users.clas.ufl.edu/sterk/junsem/haas.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In the 11th century the Tigrinya-speaking lands (Tigray-[[Medri Bahri|Mareb Melash]]) were divided into two provinces, separated by the Mereb River, by the newly enthroned Agaw emperors. The governor of the northern province received the title Bahre Negash (Ruler of the sea), whereas the governor of the southern province was given the title of Tigray Mekonen (Lord of Tigray). The Portuguese Jesuit Emanuele Baradas's work titled "Do reino de Tigr", written in 1633–34, states that the "Reino de Tigr" (Kingdom of Tigray) extended from [[Hamasien]] to [[History of Tembien|Temben]], from the borders of [[Danakil Depression|Dankel]] to the [[Adwa]] mountain. He also stated that Tigray-Mereb Melash was divided into 24 smaller political units (principalities), twelve of which were located south of the Mereb and governed by the Tigray Mekonen, based in [[Enderta Province|Enderta]]. The other twelve were located north of the Mereb, under the authority of the [[Medri Bahri|Bahre Negash]], based in the district of [[Serae]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40174776|title=Divided Histories, Opportunistic Alliances: Background Notes on the Ethiopian-Eritrean War|author=Trivelli, Richard M.|year=1998|journal=Africa Spectrum|volume=33|issue=3|pages=257–289|jstor=40174776|via=JSTOR|access-date=26 January 2022|archive-date=24 January 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220124192459/https://www.jstor.org/stable/40174776|url-status=live}}</ref>{{Rp|259}}

Other districts included [[Akkele Guzay|Akele Guzay]] (now part of [[Eritrea]]), and the kingdom of the [[Bahr negus]], who ruled much of what is now Eritrea and [[Shire, Ethiopia|Shire]] district and town in Western Tigray. At the time when Tigray Mekonnen existed simultaneously with that of Bahr negus, their frontier seems to have been the [[Mareb River]], which is currently constitutes the border between the Ethiopian province of Tigray and Eritrea.

After the loss of power of the Bahr negus in the aftermath of [[Bahr negus Yeshaq]]'s rebellions, {{failed verification span|text=the title of Tigray mekonnen gained power in relation to the Bahr negus and at times included ruling over parts of what is now Eritrea, especially in the 19th century.|date=January 2022}}<ref>{{Cite book|first=Richard|last=Pankhurst|author-link=Richard Pankhurst (historian)|title=An Introduction to the Economic History of Ethiopia|publisher=London: Lalibela House|date=1962|page=328|ol=OL5876132M}}</ref> By the unsettled [[Zemene Mesafint]] period ("Era of the Princes"), both designations had declined to little more than empty titles, and the lord who succeeded them used (and received from the Emperor) the title of either [[Ras (title)|Ras]] or [[Dejazmach]], beginning with Ras [[Mikael Sehul]]. Rulers of Tigray such as Ras [[Wolde Selassie]] alternated with others, chiefly those of [[Begemder]] or [[Yejju]], as warlords to maintain the Ethiopian monarchy during the Zemene Mesafint.

In the mid-19th century, the lords of Tembien and Enderta managed to establish an overlordship of Tigray. One of its members, Dejazmach Kahsay Mercha, ascended the imperial throne in 1872 under the name [[Yohannes IV]]. Following his 1889 death in the [[Battle of Metemma]], the Ethiopian throne came under the control of the king of [[Shewa]], and the center of power shifted south and away from Tigray.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

=== 20th century ===
In 1943, a rebellion [[Woyane rebellion|broke out]] all over southern and eastern Tigray under the slogan, "there is no government; let's organize and govern ourselves". Throughout Enderta Awraja, including [[Mekelle]], Didibadergiajen, [[Hintalo]], Saharti, [[Samre, Ethiopia|Samre]] and Wajirat, Raya Awraja, Kilte-Awlaelo Awraja and Tembien Awraja, local assemblies, called gerreb, were formed. The gerreb sent representatives to a central congress, called the shengo, which elected leaders and established a military command system. Although the first [[Woyane rebellion]] of 1943 had shortcomings as a prototype revolution, historians agree that it involved a fairly high level of spontaneity and peasant initiative. It demonstrated considerable popular participation and reflected widely shared grievances. The uprising was specifically directed against the central Shoan Amhara regime of [[Haile Selassie|Haile Selassie I]], rather than the Tigrayan imperial elite.

Following the outbreak of the [[Ethiopian Revolution]] in February 1974, the first signal of any mass uprising was the actions of the soldiers of the 4th Brigade of the 4th Army Division in Nagelle in southern Ethiopia. The Coordinating Committee of the Armed Forces, Police, and Territorial Army, or the [[Derg]] ([[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] "Committee"), was officially announced 28 June 1974 by a group of military officers. The committee elected Major [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] as its chairman and Major [[Atnafu Abate]] as its vice-chairman. In July 1974, the Derg obtained key concessions from the emperor, Haile Selassie, which included the power to arrest not only military officers but government officials at every level. Soon both former Prime Ministers [[Tsehafi Taezaz Aklilu Habte-Wold]] and [[Endelkachew Makonnen|Endalkachew Makonnen]], along with most of their cabinets, most regional governors, many senior military officers and officials of the Imperial court were imprisoned. In August 1974, after a proposed constitution creating a constitutional monarchy was presented to the emperor, the Derg began a program of dismantling the imperial government in order to forestall further developments in that direction. The Derg [[1974 Ethiopian coup d'état|deposed and imprisoned the emperor on 12 September 1974]].

[[File:Nest box for Columba guinea in Zerfenti.jpg|thumb|Nest box for ''[[Speckled pigeon|Columba guinea]]'' (considered a symbol of peace) in the wall of a homestead in [[Zerfenti]], a village in Tigray where hundreds were killed by Derg bombings.]]
In addition, the Derg in 1975 nationalized most industries and private and somewhat secure urban real-estate holdings. But mismanagement, corruption, and general hostility to the Derg's violent rule, coupled with the draining effects of constant warfare with the separatist guerrilla movements in Tigray, led to a drastic fall in general productivity of food and cash crops. In October 1978, the Derg announced the National Revolutionary Development Campaign to mobilize human and material resources to transform the economy, which led to a Ten-Year Plan (1984/1985-1993/1994) to expand agricultural and industrial output, forecasting a 6.5% growth in GDP and a 3.6% rise in per capita income. Instead per capita income declined 0.8% over this period. Famine scholar [[Alex de Waal]] observes that while the [[1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia|famine]] that struck the country in the mid-1980s is usually ascribed to drought, "closer investigation shows that widespread drought occurred only some months after the famine was already under way". Hundreds of thousands fled economic misery, conscription, and political repression, and went to live in neighboring countries and all over the [[Western world]], creating an Ethiopian [[diaspora]].

Toward the end of January 1991, a coalition of rebel forces, the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF) captured [[Gondar]], the ancient capital city, [[Bahar Dar]], and [[Dessie]].{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

==== Postwar ====
John Young, who visited the area several times in the early 1990s, attributes this delay in part to "central budget restraint, structural readjustment, and lack of awareness by government bureaucrats in [[Addis Ababa]] of conditions in the province", but notes "an equally significant obstacle was posed by an entrenched, and largely Amhara-dominated, central bureaucracy which used its power to block government-authorised funds from reaching Tigray".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=John|title=Peasant Revolution in Ethiopia: The Tigray People's Liberation Front, 1975–1991|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521026062|page=197|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S9LX8UpI97MC&pg=PA197|access-date=13 November 2020|archive-date=27 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230327025546/https://books.google.com/books?id=S9LX8UpI97MC&pg=PA197|url-status=live}}</ref> At the same time, a growing urban middle class of traders, businessmen and government officials emerged that was suspicious of and distant from the victorious EPRDF.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}
From 1991 to 2001, the president of Tigray was [[Gebru Asrat]].
In 1998, [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War|war erupted between Eritrea and Ethiopia]] over a portion of territory that had been administered as part of Tigray, which included the town of [[Badme]]. A 2002 [[United Nations]] decision awarded much of this land to Eritrea, but Ethiopia did not accept the ruling until 2018, when a [[2018 Eritrea–Ethiopia summit|bilateral agreement]] ended the [[Eritrean–Ethiopian border conflict|border conflict]].

==== 2020 administrative reorganisation ====

Between 2018 and 2020, as part of a reform aimed to deepen and strengthen decentralisation, woredas were reorganised, and new boundaries established. As smaller towns had been growing, they had started providing a larger range of services, such as markets and even banks, that encouraged locals to travel there rather than to their formal woreda centre. However, these locals still had to travel to their local woreda centre for most local government services - often in a different direction. In 2018 and 2019, after multiple village discussions that were often vigorous in the more remote areas, 21 independent urban administrations were added and other boundaries re-drawn, resulting in an increase from 35 to 88 woredas in January 2020.{{Citation needed|date=January 2022}}

=== Geology ===
==== Overview ====
The [[East African Orogeny]] led to the growth of a mountain chain in the [[Precambrian]] (up to 800 Ma [million years ago]), which was largely eroded afterwards.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sembroni |first1=A. |last2=Molin |first2=P. |last3=Dramis |first3=F. |title=Regional geology of the Dogu'a Tembien massif.

Subsequently, there was the deposition of [[sedimentary]] and [[volcanic]] formations, from older (at the foot of the massif) to younger, near the summits. From Palaeozoic to [[Triassic]], Tigray was located near the South Pole. The (reactivate) Precambrian extensional faults guided the deposition of [[Till|glacial sediments]] ([[Edaga Arbi Glacials]] and [[Enticho Sandstone]]). Later alluvial plain sediments were deposited ([[Adigrat Sandstone]]). The break-up of Gondwana ([[Late Palaeozoic]] to [[Early Triassic]]) led to an extensional [[tectonic phase]], what caused the lowering of large parts of the [[Horn of Africa]]. As a consequence a [[marine transgression]] occurred, leading to the deposition of [[marine sediments]] ([[Antalo Limestone]] and Agula Shale).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bosellini |first1=A. |last2=Russo |first2=A. |last3=Fantozzi |first3=P. |last4=Assefa |first4=G. |last5=Tadesse |first5=S. |title=The Mesozoic succession of the Mekelle Outlier (Tigrai Province, Ethiopia). |journal=Mem.

At the end of the [[Mesozoic]] tectonic phase, a new ([[Cretaceous]]) planation took place. After that, the deposition of continental sediments ([[Amba Aradam Formation]]) indicates the presence of less shallow seas, probably caused by a regional uplift. At the beginning of the [[Caenozoic]], there was a relative tectonic quiescence, during which the Amba Aradam Sandstones were partially eroded, which led to the formation of a new planation surface.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sembroni |first1=A. |last2=Molin |first2=P. |last3=Dramis |first3=F. |last4=Faccenna |first4=C. |last5=Abebe |first5=B. |title=Erosion-tectonics feedbacks in shaping the landscape: An example from the Mekele Outlier (Tigray, Ethiopia) |journal=Journal of African Earth Sciences |year=2017 |volume=129 |pages=870–886 |doi=10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2017.02.028 |bibcode=2017JAfES.129..870S }}</ref>

In the [[Eocene]], the Afar [[Mantle plume|plume]], a broad regional uplift, deformed the [[lithosphere]], leading to the eruption of [[flood basalt]]s.

==== Fossils ====
In Tigray, there are two main fossil-bearing geological units. The [[Antalo Limestone]] ([[upper Jurassic]]) is the largest. Its marine deposits comprise mainly [[benthic]] [[marine invertebrates]]. Also, the [[Tertiary]] [[lacustrine deposits]], interbedded in the [[basalt]] formations, contain a range of [[silicified]] [[mollusc]] fossils.<ref name="lerouge&aerts">{{cite book |last1=Lerouge |first1=F. |last2=Aerts |first2=R. |title=Fossil evidence of Dogu'a Tembien's environmental past.

All snail shells, both fossil and recent, are called ''t’uyo'' in [[Tigrinya language]], which means ‘[[helicoidal]]’.

==== Traditional uses of rock ====
As Tigray holds a wide variety of [[rock types]], there is expectedly a varied use of rock.
:* '''Natural [[stone masonry]]'''. Preferentially, the easier shaped [[limestone]] and [[sandstone]] are used to build homesteads and churches, but particularly in the upland areas, [[basalt]] is also used. Traditionally, fermented mud will be used as mortar
:* '''Fencing''' of homesteads, generally in [[dry stone]]s
:* '''Church bells''', generally three elongated plates in [[phonolite]] or [[clinkstone]], with different tonalities
:* '''Milling stone''': for this purpose plucked-bedrock pits, small [[rock-cut basin]]s that naturally occur in rivers with [[Kolk (vortex)|kolk]]s, are excavated from the river bed and further shaped.

:* Door and window '''[[lintels]]''', prepared from rock types that frequently have an elongated shape ([[sandstone]], [[phonolite]], [[limestone]]), or that are easily shaped ([[tufa]])
:* '''Troughs for livestock''' [[watering]] and feeding, generally hewn from [[tufa]]
:* '''Footpath [[Sidewalk|paving]]''', generally done as [[community service|community work]]. Some very ancient paved [[footpaths]] occur on major communication lines dating back to the period before the introduction of the automobile
:* foot travellers stop, pray and put an additional stone
:* Stones collected from farmlands in order to free space for the crop, and heaped in typical '''rounded metres-high heaps''', called ''zala''
:* '''[[Contour bunding]]''' or ''gedeba'': [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] walls in [[dry stone]], typically laid out along the contour for sake of [[soil conservation]]
:* '''[[Check dam]]s''' or ''qetri'' in [[gullies]] for sake of [[gully erosion]] control
:* '''[[Cobble stone]]s''', used for paving secondary streets in the towns. Generally [[limestone]] is used.

=== Water challenge ===
[[File:Leakage from Gereb Segen dam.jpg|thumb|right|Regularised stream, fed by Gereb Segen dam]]Overall, the region is [[semi-arid]]. The [[wet season]] lasts only for a couple of months. The farmers are adapted to this, but the problem arises when rains are less than normal. Another major challenge is providing water to urban areas. Smaller towns, but particularly Mekelle, face endemic [[water shortage]]s. [[Reservoirs]] have been built, but their management is sub-optimal.

=== Wildlife ===

==== Large mammals ====

Species belonging to the [[Ethiopian montane forests|Afrotropical Highland Biome]] occur in the dry evergreen montane forests of the highland plateau but can also occupy other habitats. [[Wattled Ibis]] can be found feeding in wet grassland and open woodland. [[Black-winged Lovebird]], [[Banded Barbet]], Golden-mantled or [[Abyssinian Woodpecker]], [[Montane White-eye]], [[Rüppell's Robin-chat]], [[Abyssinian Slaty Flycatcher]] and [[Tacazze Sunbird]] are found in evergreen forest, mountain woodlands and areas with scattered trees including [[fig trees]], ''[[Euphorbia abyssinica]]'' and ''[[Juniperus procera]]''. [[Erckel's spurfowl]], [[Dusky Turtle Dove]], Swainson's or [[Grey-headed Sparrow]], [[Baglafecht Weaver]], [[African Citril]], [[Brown-rumped Seedeater]] and [[Streaky Seedeater]] are common [[Afrotropical]] breeding residents of woodland edges, scrubland and forest edges. [[White-billed Starling]] and [[Little Rock Thrush]] can be found on steep cliffs; [[Columba guinea|Speckled or African rock pigeon]] and [[White-collared Pigeon]] in gorges and rocky places but also in towns and villages.<ref name="ALN2019" />

Species belonging to the [[List of desert and xeric shrubland ecoregions|Somali-Masai Biome]]. [[Hemprich's Hornbill]] and [[White-rumped Babbler]] are found in bushland, scrubland and dense secondary forest, often near cliffs, gorges or water. Chestnut-Winged or [[Somali Starling]] and [[Rüppell's Weaver]] are found in bushy and shrubby areas. [[Black-billed wood hoopoe]]s have some red at the base of the bill or an entirely red bill in this area.<ref name="ALN2019" />

Species belonging to the [[East Sudanian savanna|Sudan-Guinea Savanna Biome]]: [[Green-backed eremomela]] and [[Chestnut-crowned Sparrow-Weaver]].<ref name="ALN2019" />

Species that are neither endemic nor biome-restricted but that have restricted ranges or that can be more easily seen in Ethiopia than elsewhere in their range: [[Abyssinian Roller]] is an Ethiopian relative of [[Lilac-breasted Roller]], which is an intra-tropical breeding migrant of south and east Africa, and of [[European Roller]], an uncommon [[Palearctic]] passage migrant. [[Black-billed Barbet]], [[Yellow-breasted Barbet]] and [[Grey-headed Batis]] are species from the [[Sahel]] and [[Northern Africa]] but also occur in [[Acacia]] woodlands in the area.<ref name="ALN2019" />

The most regularly observed raptor birds in crop fields in Tigray are [[Augur buzzard]] (''Buteo augur''), [[Common Buzzard]] (''Buteo buteo''), [[Steppe Eagle]] (''Aquila nipalensis''), [[Lanner falcon]] (''Falco biarmicus''), [[Black kite]] (''Milvus migrans''), [[Yellow-billed kite]] (''Milvus aegyptius'') and [[Barn owl]] (''Tyto alba'').<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meheretu Yonas |url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030049546 |title=Raptor perch sites for biological control of agricultural pest rodents.

[[Mekelle]], home to [[Mekelle University]], [[Mekelle Institute of Technology]], [[Tigray Institute of Policy Studies]], Admas University, Microlink College, Nile College, and Mekelle College of Teacher Education is the capital of Tigray, near the geographic center of the state.

Other Tigray cities functioning as centers of Ethiopian metropolitan areas include:
:* [[Adigrat]] (home of [[Adigrat University]], [[Debre Damo|Debre Damo monastery]] and [[Addis Pharmaceutical Factory]])
:* [[Adwa]] (home of [[Adwa Pan-African University|Adwa Pan African University]],)
:* [[Axum]] (home of [[Aksum University]],)
:* [[Maychew]] (home of [[Raya University]])

Of the 10 largest cities in Tigray, [[Maychew]] has the highest elevation at 2479 meter above sea level. Plenty of smaller towns, like [[Atsbi]] and [[Idaga Hamus (Saesi Tsaedaemba)|Edaga Hamus]] are located at even higher elevations. Of the large cities, [[Humera]] is located at the lowest altitude (585 m).

== Government and politics ==

=== Executive branch ===
The executive branch is headed by the Chief Administrator of the [[Interim Regional Administration of Tigray]]. The current president is [[Getachew Reda |Getachew Reda Kahsay]], a TPLF member, appointed in 2023. A Vice President of Tigray succeeds the president in the event of any removal from office, and performs any duties assigned by the president.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lansford |first=Tom |url=https://archive.org/details/politicalhandboo0000unse_f0m6 |title=Political Handbook of the World 2015 |publisher=CQ Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-1483371559 |location=Washington, D.C., United States |url-access=registration}}</ref> The other elected constitutional offices in the executive branch are the Regional Health Bureau (''Ato'' Hagos Godefy),<ref>{{cite news |date=11 October 2013 |title=Minster of Health Visits MU's Ayder Referral Hospital |publisher=Mekelle University News |url=http://www.mu.edu.et/index.php/about-mu1?id=335 |access-date=8 July 2017 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Educational Bureau (''Ato'' Gebre'egziabher),<ref>{{cite news |date=17 December 2013 |title=MU donates 100 computers to Tigray Education Bureau |publisher=Mekelle University News |url=http://www.mu.edu.et/index.php/news-events/318-mu-donates-100-computers-to-tigray-education-bureau |access-date=8 July 2017 |archive-date=16 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190516202148/http://www.mu.edu.et/index.php/news-events/318-mu-donates-100-computers-to-tigray-education-bureau |url-status=live }}</ref> Auditor General (''Ato'' Alemseged Kebedew), and 12 other officials.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |year=2016 |title=Tigray Regional State |url=http://www.ethiopia.gov.et/statetigray |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208210826/http://www.ethiopia.gov.et/statetigray |archive-date=2015-12-08 |access-date=8 July 2017 |publisher=Ethiopian Government portal}}</ref>

=== Judicial branch ===
There are three levels of the Tigray state [[judiciary]]. The lowest level is the court of common pleas: each woreda maintains its own constitutionally mandated court of common pleas, which maintain jurisdiction over all justiciable matters.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kiros Assefa |first=Simeneh |title=Criminal Procedure Law: Principles, Rules and Practices |publisher=Xlibris Corporation |year=2010 |isbn=978-1450003391 |location=Bloomington, Indiana, United States |pages=113}}{{self-published source|date=December 2017}}</ref>{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} The intermediate-level court system is the district court system. Four courts of appeals exist, each retaining jurisdiction over appeals from common pleas, municipal, and county courts in an administrative zone. A case heard in this system is decided by a three-judge panel, and each judge is elected.

The highest-ranking court, the Tigray Supreme Court, is Tigray's "court of last resort".<ref>{{cite web |date=14 August 2015 |title=MOU Signing ceremony With Federal and Regional Supreme Courts of Ethiopia to Facilitate Support for Clearance of Backlog Files |url=http://www.jfapfe.org/News1.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105024748/http://www.jfapfe.org/News1.html |archive-date=5 November 2017 |access-date=8 July 2017 |publisher=Justice For All-PF Ethiopia}}</ref> A seven-justice panel composes the court, which, by its own discretion, hears appeals from the courts of appeals, and retains original jurisdiction over limited matters. The chief judge is called the President of Tigray Supreme Court (''W/ro'' Hirity Miheretab).

=== Legislative branch ===
The State Council, which is the highest administrative body of the state, is made up of 152 members.<ref name=":0" />

=== National politics ===
Tigray is represented by 38 representatives in the [[House of Peoples' Representatives|Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia House of Peoples' Representatives]]. But currently after the illegitimate postponement of the national election of Ethiopia Tigray has pulled it representative from the House of House of Peoples' Representatives and has no representation in the Federal parliament [https://www.dw.com/en/crisis-looms-in-ethiopia-as-elections-are-postponed/a-53829389].

== Agriculture ==

=== Cropping ===

=== Terracing and dam construction ===
[[File:Inda Abba Hadera forest.jpg|thumb|[[Gestet]] forest]]
An important aspect of the agricultural work in Tigray after the end of the 1991 civil war was to minimize the problems of drought. In the past, Tigray was covered with forests and had a micro-climate that favoured the rains. Subsequently, the forests were cut down, usually to impoverish the population during the wars. Consequently, Tigray achieved a fair amount of rainfall during the rainy season, from August to September, but quickly lost these waters downstream. In the process the fertile soil of the fields eroded. After a few weeks of rain, the country again dried up.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

[[File:Crop harvesting in Khunale.jpg|thumb|Crop harvesting in [[Khunale]]]]
The government undertook two projects in Tigray. The first was the construction of terraces which, with the agreement and help of local communities, go up to the tops of the mountains at 2,500 metres. The goal was to prevent the rainfall flowing away immediately so that it could be conserved for the agricultural season. On the highest terraces were planted trees, mainly [[eucalyptus]], the dominant tree in Ethiopia and native to [[Australia]]. These plants created a new microclimate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www-cif.climateinvestmentfunds.org/sites/default/files/aasr-2014climate-change-and-smallholder-agriculture-in-ssa.pdf |title=Africa Agriculture Status Report 2014 - Climate Change and Smallholder Agriculture in Sub-saharan Africa |access-date=2017-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801051500/https://www-cif.climateinvestmentfunds.org/sites/default/files/aasr-2014climate-change-and-smallholder-agriculture-in-ssa.pdf|archive-date=2016-08-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> The terracing method was very simple but required good organization. Long stretches of the fields were terraced by the villagers using stone walls from stones that erosion had exposed. The rains eroding the still non-terraced ground formed mudslides that were held by the topmost walls, which permitted construction of a new terrace field and another wall with uncovered stones, creating new ground terraced farmland every year.

[[File:2. Addi Amharay.jpg|thumb|[[Addi Amharay]] reservoir]]
Another endeavour involved the construction of small [[reservoir]]s for local irrigation. As rains last only for a couple of months per year, reservoirs of different sizes allow harvesting runoff from the rainy season for further use in the dry season. The dams needed to create these basins are typically an embankment of a few hundreds of meters, closing off one part of a valley, with a maximum height of 20 metres. Each took months of work, in which people carried earth on their back, and with assistance of donkeys. Generally 2,000–3,000 people — men, women and children — carried the earth in simple baskets.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

A distinctive feature of Tigray are its rock-hewn churches. Similar in design to those of [[Lalibela]] in the [[Amhara Region]], these churches are found in four or five clusters – [[Gheralta]], Teka-Tesfay, [[Atsbi]] and [[Tembien Province|Tembien]] – with Wukro sometimes included. Some of the churches are considered earlier than those of Lalibela, perhaps dating from the eighth century. Mostly [[monolithic architecture|monolithic]], with designs partly inspired by [[classical architecture]], they are often located at the top of [[cliff]]s or steep hills, for security. For example, Tigray's ancient [[Debre Damo]] monastery is accessible only by climbing a rope 25 metres up a sheer cliff.

Looting has become a major issue in the Tigray Region, as archaeological sites have become sources for construction materials and ancient artifacts used for everyday purposes by local populations.<ref>Jacke Phillips, Tekle Hagos ''et alia'', [http://antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/phillips/index.html "Combating the destruction of Ethiopia's archaeological heritage", ''Antiquity''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728014051/http://antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/phillips/index.html |date=28 July 2010 }} '''78''' (December 2004)</ref>

The area is famous for a single rock sculptured 23 meter long obelisk in [[Axum]] as well as for other fallen obelisks. The Axum treasure site of ancient Tigrayan history is a major landmark. [[Yeha]] is another important local landmark that is little-known outside the region.
