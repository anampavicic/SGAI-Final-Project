==History==
On March 24, 1849, William Davis, who owned {{convert|3000|acre|km2}} where McKinney now stands, donated {{convert|120|acre|km2}} for the townsite. Ten years later, McKinney incorporated, and in 1913, the town adopted the commission form of government.

[[File:Old Collin County Courthouse.jpg|thumb|200px|The Old Collin County Courthouse in Courthouse Square, 2016]]

For its first 125 years, McKinney served as the county's principal commercial center. The county seat provided farmers with flour, corn, cotton mills, cotton gins, a cotton compress, and a cottonseed oil mill, as well as banks, churches, schools, newspapers, and from the 1880s, an opera house. Businesses also came to include a textile mill, an ice company, a large dairy, and a garment-manufacturing company. The population grew from 35 in 1848 to 4,714 in 1912. By 1953, McKinney had a population of more than 10,000 and 355 businesses. The town continued to serve as an agribusiness center for the county until the late 1960s.

By 1970, [[Plano, Texas|Plano]] surpassed McKinney in size. McKinney experienced moderate population growth, from 15,193 in the 1970 census to 21,283 in the 1990 census. By the mid-1980s, the town had become a commuter center for residents who worked in Plano and Dallas. In 1985, it had a population of just over 16,000 and supported 254 businesses. Since then, McKinney's rate of increase has been much more dramatic. In the 2000 census, McKinney had grown to 54,369 with 2,005 businesses and in the 2010 census the population had more than doubled to 131,117 residents.<ref name="census1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/mckinneycitytexas/PST045219|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: McKinney city, Texas|website=www.census.gov}}</ref> The Census Bureau's July 2015 estimate placed the  population of McKinney at 162,898.<ref name="census1"/> A later estimate placed the city population as of January 1, 2019 as 187,802.<ref name="mckinneytexas.org">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mckinneytexas.org/294/Demographics-Census-Reports|title=Demographics, Census & Reports &#124; McKinney, TX - Official Website|website=www.mckinneytexas.org}}</ref>

He was the author of a bill establishing counties in the northern part of the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=26765|title= Profile for McKinney, Texas, TX| publisher= ePodunk|access-date=August 14, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191011054722/http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=26765 | archive-date=11 October 2019}}</ref>
