==History==
The earliest documented European settlement of the present Lakewood area was by operators of sawmills, from about 1750 forward. One such sawmill—located at the east end of the present [[Lake Carasaljo]]—was known as Three Partners Mill from at least 1789 until at least 1814. From 1815 until 1818, in the same area, Jesse Richards had an iron-[[smelting]] operation known as Washington Furnace, using the local bog iron ore. The ironworks were revived in 1833 by Joseph W. Brick, who named the business Bergen Iron Works, which also became the name of the accompanying town. In 1865, the town was renamed Bricksburg, and in 1880, it was renamed Lakewood and became a fashionable winter resort.

Lakewood's developers thought that "Bricksburg" did not capture their vision for the community, and the names "Brightwood" and "Lakewood" were proposed. After reaching out to area residents, "Lakewood" was chosen, and the [[United States Postal Service]] approved the name in March 1880.<ref>[http://www.villageprofile.com/newjersey/lakewood/01/topic.html History of Lakewood] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430102242/http://www.villageprofile.com/newjersey/lakewood/01/topic.html |date=April 30, 2011 }}, VillageProfile.com.

Erastus Dickinson suggested 'Lakewood' and the times and Journal conducted a house-to-house [[canvass]] of the citizens, who voted for 'Lakewood' by a large majority. On March 20, 1880, the Post Office officially recognized the name of the village as 'Lakewood.'"</ref> The name "Lakewood" was intended to focus on the location near lakes and pine forests.<ref>Hutchinson, Viola L.
