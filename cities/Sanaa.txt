==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Sanaa}}

===Ancient period===
According to [[Islam|Islamic]] sources, Sanaa was founded at the base of the mountains of [[Jabal Nuqum]]<ref name="Laughlin2008"/> by [[Shem]], the son of [[Noah]],<ref>Al-Hamdāni, al-Ḥasan ibn Aḥmad, ''The Antiquities of South Arabia: The Eighth Book of Al-Iklīl'', Oxford University Press 1938, pp. 8–9</ref><ref>Minaret Building and Apprenticeship in Yemen, by Trevor Marchand, Routledge (27 April 2001), p. 1.</ref><ref name="Aithe30">Aithe, p. 30.</ref> after the latter's death.

The name ''Sanaa'' is probably derived from the [[Sabaic]] root ''ṣnʿ'', meaning "well-fortified".<ref name="Smith 1997">{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=G.R. |editor1-last=Bosworth |editor1-first=C.E. |editor2-last=van Donzel |editor2-first=E. |editor3-last=Heinrichs |editor3-first=W.P. |editor4-last=Lecomte |editor4-first=G. |title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. IX (SAN-SZE) |date=1997 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |isbn=90-04-10422-4 |pages=1–3 |url=https://ia600603.us.archive.org/14/items/EncyclopaediaDictionaryIslamMuslimWorldEtcGibbKramerScholars.13/09.EncycIslam.NewEdPrepNumLeadOrient.EdEdComCon.BosDonHeinLec.etc.UndPatIUA.v9.San-Sze.Leid.EJBrill.1997..pdf |access-date=18 March 2022 |chapter=ṢANʿĀʾ}}</ref><ref name="Bosworth">{{cite book |last1=Bosworth |first1=C.

The 10th-century [[Arab]] historian [[Abū Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdānī|al-Hamdani]] wrote that Sanaa's ancient name was '''''Azāl''''', which is not recorded in any contemporary Sabaean inscriptions.<ref name="Smith 1997"/> The name "Azal" has been connected to [[Uzal]], a son of [[Qahtanite|Qahtan]], a great-grandson of Shem, in the [[Bible|biblical]] accounts of the [[Book of Genesis]].<ref name=EB>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Sana |volume=24 |pages=125–126}}</ref>
[[File:Sanaa old25.jpg|thumb|The walls of Sana'a in the 1950s]]
Al-Hamdani wrote that Sanaa was walled by the [[Sabaeans]] under their ruler [[Sha'r Awtar]], who also arguably built the [[Ghumdan Palace]] in the city. Because of its location, Sanaa has served as an urban hub for the surrounding tribes of the region and as a nucleus of regional trade in [[South Arabia|southern Arabia]]. It was positioned at the crossroad of two major ancient trade routes linking [[Ma'rib]] in the east to the [[Red Sea]] in the west.<ref name="Aithe30"/>

Appropriately enough for a town whose name means "well-fortified", Sanaa appears to have been an important military center under the Sabaeans.<ref name="Smith 1997"/> They used it as a base for their expeditions against the kingdom of [[Himyar]] further south, and several inscriptions "announce a triumphant return to Sanaa from the wars."<ref name="Smith 1997"/> Sanaa is referred to in these inscriptions both as a town (''hgr'') and as a ''maram'' (''mrm''), which, according to A. F. L. Beeston, indicates "a place to which access is prohibited or restricted, no matter whether for religious or for other reasons".<ref name="Smith 1997"/> The Sabaean inscriptions also mention the Ghumdan Palace by name.<ref name="Smith 1997"/>

When King Yousef Athar (or [[Dhu Nuwas]]), the last of the Himyarite kings, was in power, Sanaʽa was also the capital of the [[Kingdom of Aksum|Axumite]] viceroys.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}} Later tradition also holds that the [[Abyssinia]]n conqueror [[Abrahah]] built a Christian church in Sanaa.<ref name="Smith 1997"/>

===Islamic era===
[[File:SanaaQuoranDoubleVersions.jpg|thumb|The [[Sanaʽa manuscript]], found in Sanaʽa in 1972, is one of the oldest [[Qur'an|Quranic]] manuscripts in existence.]]
From the era of [[Muhammad]] (ca. 622 CE) until the founding of independent sub-states in many parts of the Yemen Islamic [[Caliph]]ate, Sanaa persisted as the governing seat. The [[Caliph]]'s deputy ran the affairs of one of Yemen's three [[Makhalif]]: Mikhlaf Sanaʽa, Mikhlaf [[Janad Region|al-Janad]], and Mikhlaf [[Hadhramaut]]. The city of Sanaa regularly regained an important status, and all Yemenite States competed to control it.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

Imam [[Al-Shafi'i]], the 8th-century Islamic jurist and founder of the [[Shafi'i]] school of jurisprudence, visited Sanaa several times. He praised the city, writing ''La budda min Ṣanʻāʼ'', or "Sanaa must be seen." In the 9th–10th centuries, it was written of the city that "the Yem separate from each other, empty of ordure, without smell or evil smells, because of the hard concrete [<nowiki/>[[adobe]] and [[Cob (material)|cob]], probably] and fine pastureland and clean places to walk." Later in the 10th-century, the Persian geographer [[Ibn Rustah]] wrote of Sanaa, "It is the city of Yemen; there cannot be found ... a city greater, more populous or more prosperous, of nobler origin or with more delicious food than it."

In 1062, Sanaa was taken over by the [[Sulayhid dynasty]] led by [[Ali al-Sulayhi]] and his wife, the popular [[Asma bint Shihab|Queen Asma]]. He made the city capital of his relatively small kingdom, which also included the [[Jabal Haraz|Haraz Mountains]]. The Sulayhids were aligned with the [[Ismaili Muslim]]-leaning [[Fatimid Caliphate]] of Egypt, rather than the [[Baghdad]]-based [[Abbasid Caliphate]] that most of [[Arabia]] followed. Al-Sulayhi ruled for about 20 years but he was assassinated by his principal local rivals, the [[Zabid]]-based Najahids. Following his death, al-Sulayhi's daughter, [[Arwa al-Sulayhi]], inherited the throne. She withdrew from Sanaa, transferring the Sulayhid capital to [[Jibla, Yemen|Jibla]], where she ruled much of Yemen from 1067 to 1138. As a result of the Sulayhid departure, the [[Hamdanids (Yemen)|Hamdanid]] dynasty took control of Sanaʽa.<ref name="McLaughlin16">McLaughlin, p. 16.</ref> Like the Sulayhids, the Hamdanids were Isma'ilis.<ref name="Smith 1997"/>

In 1173, [[Saladin]], the [[Ayyubid]] sultan of Egypt, sent his brother [[Turan-Shah]] on an expedition to conquer Yemen. The Ayyubids gained control of Sanaʽa in 1175 and united the various Yemeni tribal states, except for the northern mountains controlled by the [[Zaydi]] imams, into one entity.<ref name="McLaughlin16"/> The Ayyubids switched the country's official religious allegiance to the [[Sunni Muslim]] Abbasids. During the reign of the Ayyubid ''[[emir]]'' Tughtekin ibn Ayyub, the city underwent significant improvements. These included the incorporation of the garden lands on the western bank of the Sa'ilah, known as Bustan al-Sultan, where the Ayyubids built one of their palaces.<ref>Elsheshtawy, p. 92.</ref> However, Ayyubid control of Sanaa was never very consistent, and they only occasionally exercised direct authority over the city.<ref name="Smith 1997"/> Instead, they chose [[Ta'izz]] as their capital, while [[Aden]] was their principal income-producing city.

While the [[Rasulid]]s controlled most of Yemen, followed by their successors, the [[Tahirids (Yemen)|Tahirids]], Sanaa largely remained in the political orbit of the [[Zaydi]] imams from 1323 to 1454 and outside the former two dynasties' rule.<ref name="Bosworth463">Bosworth, p. 463.</ref> The [[Mamelukes]] arrived in Yemen in 1517.

===Ottoman era===
[[File:San'a şehir haritası (1874).png|thumb|Ottoman map of Sanaa, 1874]]
The [[Ottoman Empire]] entered Yemen in 1538, when [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] was [[Sultan]].<ref name="Dumper330"/> Under the military leadership of [[Özdemir Pasha]], the Ottomans conquered Sanaa in 1547.<ref name="Bosworth463"/> With Ottoman approval, European captains based in the Yemeni port towns of [[Aden]] and [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]] frequented Sanaa to maintain special privileges and capitulations for their trade. In 1602, the local Zaydi imams led by [[Al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad|Imam al-Mu'ayyad]] reasserted their control over the area,<ref name="Dumper330"/> and forced out Ottoman troops in 1629. Although the Ottomans fled during al-Mu'ayyad's reign, his predecessor [[al-Mansur al-Qasim]] had already vastly weakened the Ottoman army in Sanaʽa and Yemen.<ref name="Bosworth463"/> Consequently, European traders were stripped of their previous privileges.<ref name="Dumper330">Dumper, p. 330.</ref>

The Zaydi imams maintained their rule over Sanaa until the mid-19th century when the Ottomans relaunched their campaign to control the region. In 1835, Ottoman troops arrived on the Yemeni coast under the guise of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]]'s troops.<ref name="Dumper330"/> They did not capture Sanaa until 1872, when their troops led by [[Ahmed Muhtar Pasha]] entered the city.<ref name="Bosworth463"/> The Ottoman Empire instituted the [[Tanzimat]] reforms throughout the lands they governed.

In Sanaa, city planning was initiated for the first time, new roads were built, and schools and hospitals were established. The reforms were rushed by the Ottomans to solidify their control of Sanaʽa to compete with an expanding [[Egypt]], British influence in [[Aden]], and imperial Italian and French influence along the coast of [[Somalia]], particularly in the towns of [[Djibouti]] and [[Berbera]]. The modernization reforms in Sanaa were still very limited, however.<ref name="Dumper331"/>

===North Yemen period===
[[File:Dar al hajar edit.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Dar al-Hajar]], the residence of [[Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din|Imam Yahya]] in the Wādī Ẓahr ({{lang|ar|وادى ظهر}}) near Sanaʽa]]

In 1904, as Ottoman influence was waning in Yemen, [[Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din|Imam Yahya]] of the [[Zaydism|Zaydi]] [[Imams of Yemen|Imam]]s took power in Sanaa. In a bid to secure [[Kingdom of Yemen|North Yemen]]'s independence, Yahya embarked on a policy of isolationism, avoiding international and Arab world politics, cracking down on embryonic liberal movements, not contributing to the development of infrastructure in Sanaa and elsewhere and closing down the Ottoman girls' school. As a consequence of Yahya's measures, Sanaa increasingly became a hub of anti-government organization and intellectual revolt.<ref name="Dumper331">Dumper, p. 331.</ref>

In the 1930s, several organizations opposing or demanding reform of the Zaydi imamate sprung up in the city, particularly Fatat al-Fulayhi, a group of various Yemeni [[Muslim scholars]] based in Sanaʽa's Fulayhi Madrasa, and Hait al-Nidal ("Committee of the Struggle.") By 1936, most of the leaders of these movements were imprisoned. In 1941, another group based in the city, the Shabab al-Amr bil-Maruf wal-Nahian al-Munkar, called for a ''[[nahda]]'' ("renaissance") in the country as well as the establishment of a parliament with Islam as the instrument of Yemeni revival. Yahya largely repressed the Shabab and most of its leaders were executed following his son [[Ahmad bin Yahya|Imam Ahmad]]'s inheritance of power in 1948.<ref name="Dumper331"/> That year, Sanaa was replaced with [[Ta'izz]] as capital following Ahmad's new residence there. Most government offices followed suit. A few years later, most of the city's Jewish population emigrated to Israel.<ref name="R&S631"/>

Ahmad began a process of gradual economic and political liberalization, but by 1961, Sanaa was witnessing major demonstrations and riots demanding quicker reform and change.

The new government's modernization projects changed the face of Sanaa: the new [[Tahrir Square, Sanaa|Tahrir Square]] was built on what had formerly been the former imam's palace grounds, and new buildings were constructed on the north and northwest of the city. This was accompanied by the destruction of several of the old city's gates, as well as sections of the wall around it.<ref name="Lamprakos">{{cite journal |last1=Lamprakos |first1=Michele |title=Rethinking Cultural Heritage: Lessons from Sana'a, Yemen |journal=Traditional Dwellings and Settlements Review |date=2005 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=17–37 |jstor=41747744 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41747744 |access-date=14 February 2021 |archive-date=17 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210417182018/https://www.jstor.org/stable/41747744 |url-status=live }}</ref>

After the end of the civil war in 1970, Sanaa began to expand outward.<ref name="Lamprakos"/> This was a period of prosperity in Yemen, partly due to the massive migration of Yemeni workers to the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf states]] and their subsequent sending of money back home. At first, most of the new development was concentrated around central areas like al-Tahrir, the modern centre; [[Bi'r al-Azab]], the Ottoman quarter; and [[Bab al-Yaman]], the old southern gate. However, this soon shifted to the city's outskirts, where an influx of immigrants from the countryside established new neighborhoods. Two areas in particular experienced major growth during this period: first, the area along Taizz Road in the south, and second, a broader area on the west side of the city, between Bi'r al-Azab and the new avenue called Sittin.<ref name="Le grand Sanaa">{{cite journal |last1=Stadnicki |first1=Roman |last2=Touber |first2=Julie |title=Le grand Sanaa Multipolarité et nouvelles formes d'urbanité dans la capitale du Yémen |journal=Annales de Géographie |date=2008 |volume=117 |issue=659 |pages=32–53 |doi=10.3917/ag.659.0032 |jstor=23457582 |doi-access=free }}</ref> A new ring road, built in the 1970s on the recommendation of the [[United Nations Development Programme]], encouraged land speculation and further contributed to the rapid expansion of Sanaa.<ref name="Lamprakos"/>

Sanaa's new areas were physically different from the quarters of the old city. Many of the Yemenis who had migrated to the Gulf states had worked in construction, where they had become well-acquainted with Western and Egyptian techniques. When they returned to Yemen, they brought those techniques with them. New construction consisted of concrete and concrete block houses with multi-lite windows and plaster decorations, laid out in a grid pattern. Their amenities, including independence from extended families and the possibility of owning a car, attracted many families from the old city, and they moved to the new districts in growing numbers. Meanwhile, the old city, with its unpaved streets, poor drainage, lack of water and sewer systems, and litter (from the use of manufactured products, which was becoming increasingly common), was becoming increasingly unattractive to residents. Disaster struck in the late 1970s — water pipes were laid to bring water into the old city, but there was no way to pipe it out, resulting in huge amounts of groundwater building up in the old city. This destabilized building foundations and led to many houses collapsing.<ref name="Lamprakos"/>

===21st century===

Following the [[Yemeni unification|unification of Yemen]], Sanaa was designated capital of the new Republic of Yemen. It houses the presidential palace, the [[Assembly of Representatives of Yemen|parliament]], the supreme court, and the country's government ministries. The largest source of employment is provided by governmental civil service. Due to massive rural immigration, Sanaa has grown far outside its Old City, but this has placed a huge strain on the city's underdeveloped infrastructure and municipal services, particularly water.<ref name="Dumper331"/>

Sanaa was chosen as the 2004 [[Arab Cultural Capital]] by the [[Arab League]]. In 2008, the [[Al Saleh Mosque]] was completed. It holds over 40,000 worshippers.

In 2011, Sanaa, as the Yemeni capital, was the centre of the [[Yemeni Revolution]], in which [[President of Yemen|President]] [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] was ousted. Between May and November, the city was a battleground in what became known as the [[Battle of Sanaa (2011)|2011 Battle of Sanaa]].

On May 21, 2012, Sanaa was [[2012 Sanaa bombing|attacked]] by a suicide bomber, resulting in the deaths of 120 soldiers.

On January 23, 2013, a drone strike near Al-Masna'ah village killed two civilians, according to a report<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/death-drones-report-eng-20150413.pdf|title=Death by Drone report|access-date=20 May 2018|archive-date=23 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181223035509/https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/death-drones-report-eng-20150413.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> issued by [[Radhya Al-Mutawakel]] and Abdulrasheed Al-Faqih and [[Open Society Foundations|Open Societies Foundations.]]

==Geography and climate==
[[File:جبل نقم - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Jabal Nuqm or Jabal Nuqum ({{langx|ar|جَبَل نُقُم}}) of the Yemeni ''[[Sarawat Mountains|Sarawat]]'' in the area of Sanaa. Local legend has it that after the death of [[Noah]], his son [[Shem]] built the city at the base of this mountain.<ref name="Laughlin2008a"/>]]

===Natural setting===
Sanaa is located on a plain of the same name, the '''Haql Sanaa''', which is over 2,200m above sea level. The plain is roughly 50–60&nbsp;km long north–south and about 25&nbsp;km wide, east–west, in the area north of Sanaa, and somewhat narrower further south. To the east and west, the Sanaa plain is bordered by cliffs and [[Al-Nahdayn Mountain|mountains]], with [[wadi]]s coming down from them. The northern part of the area slopes gently upward toward the district of [[Arhab]], which was historically known as ''al-Khashab''. Much of the Sanaa plain is drained by the [[Wadi al-Kharid]], which flows northward, through the northeastern corner of the plain, towards [[Jawf (Yemen)|al-Jawf]], which is a broad wadi that drains the eastern part of the Yemeni highlands. The southern part of the plain straddles the [[drainage divide|watershed]] between the al-Kharid and the [[Wadi Siham]], which flows southwest towards the Yemeni [[Tihama]].<ref name="Gazetteer">{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Robert T.O. |title=Gazetteer of Historical North-West Yemen |date=1989 |publisher=Georg Olms AG |location=Germany |pages=7–9, 137, 244, 331 |isbn=9783487091952 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SnMrAAAAMAAJ |access-date=16 February 2021 |archive-date=6 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210506142001/https://www.google.com/books/edition/Gazetteer_of_Historical_North_West_Yemen/SnMrAAAAMAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Sanaa itself is located at the narrowest part of the plain, nestled between [[Jabal Nuqum]] to the east and the foothills of Jabal An-Nabi Shu'ayb, Yemen's tallest mountain, to the west. The mountain's peak is {{convert|25|km|mile|abbr=on}} west of Sanaa.<ref name="Gazetteer"/> Because of this position, with the city sandwiched between mountains to the east and west, most of Sanaa's expansion in recent decades has been along a north-south axis.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/>

Jabal Nuqum rises about {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=off}} above Sanaa.<ref name="Gazetteer"/> According to the 10th-century writer [[Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdani|Al-Hamdani]], the mountain was the site of an iron mine, although no trace of it exists today; he also mentions a particular type of [[onyx]] which came from Nuqum.<ref name="Gazetteer"/> [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]] described a dam located at Nuqum; its location is not known.<ref name="Gazetteer"/> This dam probably served to divert the waters coming down from the western face of the mountain and prevent them from flooding the city of Sanaa.<ref name="Gazetteer"/> Such a flood is known to have happened in 692 (73 AH), before the dam was built, and it is described as having destroyed some of Sanaa's houses.<ref name="Gazetteer"/> Despite its proximity to the city, Jabal Nuqum does not appear to have been fortified until 1607 (1016 AH), when a fort was built to serve as a lookout point to warn of potential attackers.<ref name="Gazetteer"/> The main mountain stronghold during the Middle Ages was [[Jabal Barash]], further to the east.<ref name="Gazetteer"/>

Parts of the Sanaa plain have signs of relatively recent volcanic activity (geologically speaking), with volcanic cones and lava fields. One such area is located to the north, on the road to the [[Qa al-Bawn]], and the next plain to the north, located around [['Amran]] and [[Raydah]]. The modern route between the two plains passes to the west of [[Jabal Din]], a volcanic peak that marks the highest point between the two plains, although in medieval times the main route went to the east of the mountain.<ref name="Gazetteer"/>

===Architecture===
Sanaa's Old City is renowned for its [[tower house]]s, which are typically built from stone and fired brick and can reach up to 8 stories in height. The doors and windows feature are decorated with [[plaster]] openings. They traditionally housed a single extended patrilineal family, with new floors being built as sons married and had children of their own. (New buildings would also sometimes be built on adjacent land.) The ground floor was typically used as grain storage and for housing animals. Most families no longer keep either animals or grain, so many homeowners set up shops on the ground floor instead. (This often leads to conflict with building inspectors, since doing so is prohibited by law.)<ref name="Lamprakos"/> Meanwhile, the uppermost story, called the ''mafraj'', is used as a second reception room and hosts afternoon qat chewing sessions.<ref name="Smith 1997"/>

Tower houses continue to be built in Sanaa, often using modern materials; often they are built from concrete blocks with decorative "veneers" of brick and stone.<ref name="Lamprakos"/> These "neo-traditional" tower houses are found in newer districts as well as the old city.<ref name="Le grand Sanaa"/>

Most new residences built in Sanaa, though, use newer styles of architecture. The most common are "new villas", which are low-rise houses with fenced yards; they are especially common in the southern and western parts of the city. The other main archetype is smaller, "Egyptian-style" houses, which are usually built with reinforced concrete. These are most commonly found in the northern and eastern parts of Sanaa.<ref name="Le grand Sanaa"/>

===Cityscape===
Generally, Sanaʽa is divided into two parts: the [[Old City District]] ("al-Qadeemah") and the new city ("al-Jadid.") The former is much smaller and retains the city's ancient heritage and mercantile way-of-living while the latter is an urban sprawl with many suburbs and modern buildings. The newer parts of the city were largely developed in the 1960s and onward when Sanaʽa was chosen as the republican capital.<ref name="R&S631"/>

In recent decades, Sanaa has grown into a multipolar city, with various districts and suburbs serving as hubs of commercial, industrial, and social activity. Their development has generally been unplanned by central authorities. Many of them were initially set up by new arrivals from rural areas. Increasing land prices and commercial rents in the central city has also pushed many residents and commercial establishment outwards, towards these new hubs. [[Souk]]s have been especially important in the development of these areas.<ref name="Le grand Sanaa"/>

===Neighbourhoods===

The [[Old City District|Old City]] of Sanaʽa<ref name="Laughlin2008a">{{cite book |last=McLaughlin |first=Daniel |title=Yemen |publisher=[[Bradt Travel Guides]] |chapter=1: Background |page=3 |isbn=978-1-8416-2212-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQvhZaEVzjcC |year=2008 |access-date=7 January 2019 |archive-date=14 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230214213157/https://books.google.com/books?id=eQvhZaEVzjcC |url-status=live }}</ref> is recognised as a [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Site. The old fortified city has been inhabited for more than 2,500 years and contains many intact architectural sites. The oldest, partially standing architectural structure in the Old City of Sanaʽa is [[Ghumdan Palace]]. The city was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by the United Nations in 1986. Efforts are underway to preserve some of the oldest buildings some of which, such as the Samsarh and the [[Great Mosque of Sanaʽa]], is more than 1,400 years old. Surrounded by ancient clay walls that stand {{convert|9|-|14|m|ft}} high, the Old City contains more than 100 mosques, 12 ''hammams'' (baths), and 6,500 houses. Many of the houses resemble ancient skyscrapers, reaching several stories high and topped with flat roofs. They are decorated with elaborate friezes and intricately carved frames and stained-glass windows.

One of the most popular attractions is ''Suq al-Milh'' (Salt Market), where it is possible to buy salt along with bread, spices, raisins, cotton, copper, pottery, silverware, and antiques. The 7th-century [[Great Mosque of Sanaʽa|''Jāmiʿ al-Kabīr'']] (the Great Mosque) is one of the oldest mosques in the world. The ''[[Bab al-Yaman|Bāb al-Yaman]]''<ref name="Laughlin2008a" /> ("Gate of the Yemen") is an iconized entry point through the city walls and is more than 1,000 years old. Traditionally, the Old City was composed of several quarters (''hara''), generally centred on an endowed complex containing a mosque, a [[Turkish bath|bathhouse]], and an agricultural garden (''maqshama''). Human waste from households was disposed of via chutes. In the mountain air, it dried fairly quickly and was then used as fuel for the bathhouse. Meanwhile, the gardens were watered using [[gray water]] from the mosque's ablution pool.<ref name="Lamprakos" />

=====Al-Tahrir=====
[[At Tahrir District|Al-Tahrir]] was designed as the new urban and economic hub of Sanaa during the 1960s. It is still the symbolic centre of the city, but economic activity here is relatively low. In the 21st century, development here pivoted more towards making it a civic and recreational centre.<ref name="Le grand Sanaa"/>

=====Bi'r al-Azab=====
An old Ottoman and Jewish quarter of Sanaa<ref name="Le grand Sanaa"/> located to the west of the old city, Bi'r al-Azab was first mentioned in historical sources in 1627 (1036 AH), in the ''[[Ghayat al-amanni]]'' of [[Yahya ibn al-Husayn]].<ref name="Gazetteer"/>

As part of central Sanaa, Bi'r al-Azab was one of the areas where new development was first concentrated during the 1970s. Today, it is mostly a residential and administrative district, with embassies, the office of the Prime Minister, and the chamber of deputies being located here.<ref name="Le grand Sanaa"/>

====Others====
The area roughly between the two main circular roads around the city (Ring Road and Sittin) is extremely active, with a high population density and very busy souks. These areas are crossed by major commercial thoroughfares such as al-Zubayri and [[Abd al-Mughni Street]], and are extensively served by public transport. Particularly significant districts in this area include [[al-Hasabah]] in the north, [[Shumayla]] in the south, and [[Hayil, Yemen|Hayil]] in the west.<ref name="Le grand Sanaa"/> Al-Hasabah was formerly a separate village as described by medieval writers [[Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdani|al-Hamdani]] and [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi|al-Razi]], but by the 1980s it had become a suburb of Sanaa.<ref name="Gazetteer"/>

The southwestern area on both sides of [[Haddah Road]] is a generally affluent area with relatively more reliable access to utilities like water and sanitation. Many residents originally moved here from Aden after Yemeni reunification in 1990. Since the 1990s, there has been development of high-rise buildings in this area.<ref name="Le grand Sanaa"/>

===Administration===
{{see also|List of districts of Yemen}}
In 1983, as Sanaa experienced an explosion in population, the city was made into a governorate of its own, called '''Amanat al-Asimah''' (''"the Capital's Secretariat"''), by Presidential Decree No. 13.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> This governorate was then subdivided into nine districts in 2001, by Presidential Decree No. 2; a tenth district, [[Bani Al Harith District]], was added within the same year.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> However, the exact legal status of the new Amanat al-Asimah Governorate, and the hierarchy of administrative authority, was never made clear.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/>

Since then, the city of Sanaa has encompassed the following districts:
*[[Old City District]]
*[[Al Wahdah District]]
*[[As Sabain District]]
*[[Assafi'yah District]]
*[[At Tahrir District]]
*[[Ath'thaorah District]]
*[[Az'zal District]]
*[[Bani Al Harith District]]
*[[Ma'ain District]]
*[[Shu'aub District]]

===Climate===
Sanaʽa features a cold [[desert climate]] ([[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system|Köppen]]: BWk).<ref name="Climate-Data.org">{{Cite web |url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/3171/ |title=Climate: Sanaa – Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table |publisher=Climate-Data.org |access-date=2014-02-23 |archive-date=8 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108002826/http://en.climate-data.org/location/3171/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Sanaʽa sees on average {{convert|265|mm|2|abbr=on}} of [[precipitation]] per year. Due to its high elevation, however, temperatures are much more moderate than many other cities on the [[Arabian Peninsula]]; average temperatures remain relatively constant throughout the year in Sanaa, with its coolest month being January and its warmest month July. Even considering this, as a result of its lower latitude and higher elevation, [[UV radiation]] from the sun is much stronger than in the hotter climates further north on the [[Arab peninsula]].

The city seldom experiences extreme heat or cold. Some areas around the city, however, can see temperatures fall to around {{convert|-9|C|0}} or {{convert|-7|C|0}} during winter. [[Frost]] usually occurs in the early winter mornings, and there is a slight [[wind chill]] in the city at elevated areas that causes the cold mornings to be bitter, including low [[humidity]]. The sun warms the city to the high {{convert|20|-|22|C|abbr=on}} during the noontime but it drops drastically after nightfall to a low around {{convert|3|-|4|C|abbr=on}}.

The city experiences many [[microclimate]]s from district to district because of its location in the Sanaa basin and uneven elevations throughout the city. Summers are warm and it can cool swiftly at night, especially after rainfall. Sanaa receives almost all of its annual rainfall from April to August. Rainfall amounts vary from year to year; some years could see {{convert|500|–|600|mm|in|abbr=in}} of rainfall, while others barely get {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=in}}. High temperatures have increased slightly during the summer over the past few years, while low temperatures and winter temperatures have also risen over the same period.

===Music===
Sanaa has a rich musical tradition and is particularly renowned for the musical style called ''al-Ghina al-San'ani'' ({{langx|ar|الغناء الصنعاني}} {{transliteration|ar|al-ġināʾ aṣ-Ṣanʿānī}}), or "the song of Sanaa", which dates back to the 14th century and was designated as a [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage]] in 2003.<ref name="Song of Sanaa">{{cite web |title=Song of Sana'a |url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/song-of-sanaa-00077 |website=UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage |access-date=3 March 2021 |archive-date=10 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201210130156/https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/song-of-sanaa-00077 |url-status=live }}</ref> This style of music is not exclusive to Sanaa, and is found in other areas of Yemen as well, but it is most closely associated with the city.<ref name="Song of Sanaa"/> It is one of about five regional genres or "colors" (''lawn'') of Yemeni music, along with [[Yafa'|Yafi]]'i, [[Lahej]]i, [[Aden]]i, and [[Hadhramaut|Hadhrami]].<ref name="Flagg 2007">{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Flagg |title=The Moral Resonance of Arab Media |date=2007 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-932885-32-6 |pages=223, 225–6, 240, 245, 271 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qEa3rA3tQ-sC |access-date=25 January 2022 |archive-date=25 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220125073911/https://books.google.com/books?id=qEa3rA3tQ-sC |url-status=live }}</ref> It is often part of social events, including the [[samra (wedding)|samra]], or evening wedding party, and the [[magyal]], or daily afternoon gathering of friends.<ref name="Song of Sanaa"/>

The basic format consists of a singer accompanied by two instrumentalists, one playing the [[qanbus]] (Yemeni lute) and the other playing the [[sahn nuhasi]], which is a copper tray balanced on the musician's thumbs and played by being lightly struck by the other eight fingers.<ref name="Song of Sanaa"/> Lyrics are in both [[classical Arabic]] and [[Yemeni Arabic]] and are known for their wordplay and emotional content.<ref name="Song of Sanaa"/> Singers often use [[melisma]]tic vocals, and the arrangements feature pauses between verses and instrumental sections.<ref name="Flagg 2007"/> Skilled performers often "embellish" a song's melody to highlight its emotional tone.<ref name="Song of Sanaa"/>

In the earliest days of the recording industry in Yemen, from 1938 into the 1940s, Sanaani music was the dominant genre among Yemenis who could afford to buy [[phonograph record|record]]s and [[phonograph]]s (primarily in Aden).<ref name="Flagg 2007"/> As prices fell, Sanaani-style records became increasingly popular among the middle class, but at the same time, it began to encounter competition from other genres, including Western and Indian music as well as music from other Arab countries.<ref name="Flagg 2007"/> The earliest Sanaani recording stars generally came from wealthy religious families.<ref name="Flagg 2007"/> The most popular was 'Ali Abu Bakr Ba Sharahil, who recorded for [[Odeon Records]]; other popular artists included Muhammad and Ibrahim al-Mas, Ahmad 'Awad al-Jarrash, and Muhammad 'Abd al-Rahman al-Makkawi.<ref name="Flagg 2007"/>

===Theatre===
{{main article|Theatre in Yemen}}
Yemen has a rich, lively tradition of theatre-going back at least a century. In Sanaa, most performances take place at the [[Cultural Center (Sanaa)|Cultural Center]]<ref name="Hennessey in journal">{{cite journal |last1=Hennessey |first1=Katherine |title=Drama in Yemen: Behind the Scenes at World Theater Day |journal=Middle East Report |date=2014 |issue=271 |pages=36–49 |jstor=24426557 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24426557 |access-date=15 February 2021 |archive-date=15 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210415025328/https://www.jstor.org/stable/24426557 |url-status=live }}</ref> (''Markaz al-Thaqafi''),<ref name="Hennessey in book">{{cite book |last1=Hennessey |first1=Katherine |editor1-last=Lackner |editor1-first=Helen |title=Why Yemen Matters: A Society in Transition |date=2014 |isbn=9780863567827 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R0EhBQAAQBAJ |access-date=14 February 2021 |chapter=Yemeni Society in the Spotlight: Theatre and Film in Yemen Before, During, and After the Arab Spring |archive-date=14 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414044400/https://books.google.com/books?id=R0EhBQAAQBAJ |url-status=live }}</ref> which was originally designed as an auditorium instead of a theatre. It "possesses only the most basic of lighting and sound equipment, and the smallest of wings"<ref name="Hennessey in journal"/> and lacks space to store props or backdrops. Yet despite the scarce resources, "dramatic talent and creativity abound"<ref name="Hennessey in journal"/> and productions draw large, enthusiastic crowds who react on the action onstage with vigor: "uproarious laughter at clever lines, and deafening cheers for the victorious hero, but also occasional shouts of disagreement, cries of shock when an actor or actress breaks a taboo or expresses a controversial opinion."<ref name="Hennessey in journal"/> [[Katherine Hennessey]] draws attention to the fact that Yemeni women act alongside men onstage, write and direct plays ([[Nargis Abbad]] being one of the most popular), and make up a significant part of audiences, often bringing their children with them. She contrasts all these factors to the other countries on the Arabian peninsula: places like [[Qatar]] or [[Saudi Arabia]] have extensive resources and fancier facilities, but not much of a theatrical tradition, and casts and audiences are often segregated by gender.<ref name="Hennessey in journal"/>

Since Yemeni reunification in the early 1990s, the government has sponsored annual national theatre festivals, typically scheduled to coincide with [[World Theatre Day]] on March 27. In the 21st century, the actors and directors have increasingly come from Sanaa.<ref name="Hennessey in journal"/> In 2012, in addition to the festival, there was a national theatre competition, sponsored by [[Equal Access Yemen]] and [[Future Partners for Development]], featuring theatre troupes from around the country. It had two rounds; the first was held in six different governorates, and the second was held in Sanaa.<ref name="Hennessey in book"/>

Sanaa's theatre scene was disrupted by war and famine in the 2010s; additionally, since the Houthis gained control of the city in 2014, they "have imposed strict rules on dress, gender segregation, and entertainment in the capital." In December 2020, however, a performance was held in Sanaa by one troupe, to offer respite and entertainment to people in a city suffering from the civil war and the ongoing [[Coronavirus in Yemen|coronavirus pandemic]]. Directed by [[Mohammed Khaled (director)|Mohammad Khaled]], the performance drew a crowd of "dozens of men, women and children."<ref name="2020 theatre performance">{{cite news |title=Theatre troupe bring smiles and comic relief to war-weary Yemenis |url=https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20201229-theatre-troupe-bring-smiles-and-comic-relief-to-war-weary-yemenis |access-date=15 February 2021 |work=France 24 |archive-date=15 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210215011431/https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20201229-theatre-troupe-bring-smiles-and-comic-relief-to-war-weary-yemenis |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Sports===
[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Sanaʽa. The city is home to the [[Ali Muhesen Stadium]], home of the [[Yemen national football team]], and is mostly used for football matches. The stadium holds 25,000 people.

=== Qat ===
There is a daily practice of Qat chewing which exists within the city of Sana'a. [[Khat|Qat]] is a type of plant with stimulant-like qualities. This daily practice occurs in a mafraj, which is a room designated for Qat chewing. Qat comes in three different varieties, Ahmar, Abiad, and Azraq, (translated to red white, and blue) with Ahmar being considered of the highest quality, and Abiad being considered the weakest. According to a foreign resident, the Qat from the North of Sana'a is the most prized of the Qat grown locally. This daily chewing tradition starts in the Qat market, with the leaves used for a particular day being bought day of use.<ref>Johnson, Gregory. "Qat in Yemen."

The city's population growth soared from the 1960s onward as a result of mass rural migration to the city in search of employment and improved standard of living.<ref name="R&S631">Ring and Salkin, p. 631.</ref> Sanaʽa is the fastest-growing capital city in the world with a growth rate of 7%,<ref>{{cite web|title=Sanaʽa running out of water with no plan to save it|date=23 March 2010 |url=http://globalurbanist.com/2010/03/23/sanaa-running-out-of-water-with-no-plan-to-save-it|publisher=The Global Urbanist|access-date=23 March 2010|archive-date=18 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118135315/http://globalurbanist.com/2010/03/23/sanaa-running-out-of-water-with-no-plan-to-save-it|url-status=live}}</ref> while the growth rate of the nation as a whole is 3.2%.<ref>{{cite web|title=At a glance: Yemen – Statistics|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/yemen_statistics.html|publisher=UNICEF|access-date=7 April 2011|archive-date=9 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190309144620/https://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/yemen_statistics.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> About 10% of the population resides in the Old City, while the remainder lives in the outside districts.<ref name="R&S631"/> The three large administrative districts in increasing population size are Shu'ub (شعوب), Ma'in (معيت), and As-sab'in (السبعين), with populations of about 500,000, 630,000, and 730,000 respectively.<ref name=":0" />

===Social class===
Before the revolution of 1962, Sanaani society was divided into a fairly well-defined hierarchy of social classes.<ref name="Marchand 2001">{{cite book |last1=Marchand |first1=Trevor |title=Minaret Building and Apprenticeship |date=2001 |publisher=Curzon Press |isbn=0-7007-1511-8 |pages=68–71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NV1UAQAAQBAJ |access-date=27 January 2022 |archive-date=27 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220127053701/https://books.google.com/books?id=NV1UAQAAQBAJ |url-status=live }}</ref> There were five major groups: ranked from highest to lowest, they were the [[sayyid]]s, the [[qadi]]s, the ''mansib''s (plural: ''manasib''), the ''Bani Khumis'' (also called the ''muzayyin''), and the ''akhdam''.<ref name="Marchand 2001"/> Since then, the system of social class has changed significantly in the context of market capitalism.<ref name="Marchand 2001"/>

At the top of the traditional social order were the sayyids, who claimed descent from Muhammad and were therefore seen as the legitimate ruling class.<ref name="Marchand 2001"/> Right below them were the qadis, who similarly claimed descent from "an original class of judges".<ref name="Marchand 2001"/> Because of their elite status, the sayyids were the main targets of the 1962 revolution, but they and the qadis continue to wield a strong cultural influence today.<ref name="Marchand 2001"/>

Below these elite groups were the ''manasib'', whose name literally means "dignity", "rank", or "position".<ref name="Marchand 2001"/> These included artisans employed in "honourable" trades, such as metalsmiths (for gold, silver, copper, and iron), carpenters, dyers, builders and masons, plumbers, turners (i.e. [[lathe]] operators), porters, painters of inscriptions, and makers of weapons, hookahs, or mattresses.<ref name="Marchand 2001"/> Although these trades were seen as somewhat demeaning for members of the upper classes to take part in, they were still fairly respectable and in some cases sayyids or qadis would engage in them as a main source of income.<ref name="Marchand 2001"/> The ''manasib'' were generally considered to have tribal ancestry and martial connotations, and they were the ones who were mustered to defend the city when it was attacked.<ref name="Marchand 2001"/>

The Bani Khumis, literally the "sons of the fifth", were the ones who took part in trades that the three higher-ranked classes refused to work in.<ref name="Marchand 2001"/> These included cobblers, tanners, makers of leather sheaths, saddlers, brickmakers, butchers, barbers, bath attendants, coffee house proprietors, brass founders, and vegetable gardeners.<ref name="Marchand 2001"/> Below the Bani Khumis were the ''akhdam'', the lowest social class, who were mostly street sweepers.<ref name="Marchand 2001"/>

This traditional class hierarchy began to change rapidly in the decades after the 1962 revolution.<ref name="Marchand 2001"/> Particularly during the 1970s, there was a shift towards a new social hierarchy that was based not on birthright but on wealth.<ref name="Marchand 2001"/> For example, working in commerce (such as qat merchants or café proprietors) was traditionally looked down upon by upper classes like sayyids and ''qabili''s (i.e. tribesmen), but as it became increasingly lucrative during the 1970s, it was increasingly seen as respectable and now some members of the traditional upper classes are willing to engage in these trades.<ref name="Marchand 2001"/> (This does not extend to all profitable trades, though — butchering, for example, still has a stigma despite bringing in a fair amount of money.)<ref name="Marchand 2001"/>

This shift has been far more pronounced in Sanaa, a big city where resources are most concentrated than in rural areas (where old social divisions are much more strongly maintained today).<ref name="Marchand 2001"/> Some of the contributing factors to the shift included the new education system, modeled on [[Egypt]]'s; widespread migration of Yemeni men to other, oil-rich Arab states; and greater integration of Yemen into the global economy.<ref name="Marchand 2001"/>

===Jewish community===
[[File:Abraham b. Abraham Yitzhak Halevi and family.jpg|thumb|left|Yemeni Jewish family from Sanaʽa, ca. 1940]]
Jews have been present in Yemen since the 5th century BCE and form part of the historic [[Jewish diaspora]]s.<ref>[[Jacob Saphir]], in his ethnographic work ''Iben Safir'' (vol. 1 – ch. 43), Lyck 1866, p. 99 – folio A (Hebrew), states that the Jews of Yemen have a tradition that their settlement in Yemen began 42 years before the destruction of the First Temple. The Jewish year for the destruction of the First Temple is traditionally given in Jewish computation as 3338 [[Anno Mundi|AM]] or 421/2 BCE. This differs from the modern scientific year, which is usually expressed using the [[Proleptic Julian calendar]] as 587 BCE.</ref> In Sanaʽa, Jews had initially settled within the enclosed citadel, known as al-Qaṣr, near the ruins of the old tower known as [[Ghumdan Palace]], but were evicted from there in the late 6th century by the ruling monarch, and moved to a different section of the city, known as al-Marbaki (also called the Falayhi Quarter). From there, they again uprooted and were made to settle in the section of the city known as al-Quzali, and eventually moved and settled in the neighborhood of al-Sa'ilah. In 1679, during the [[Mawza Exile]], they were once again evicted from their place of residence. Upon returning to the city in 1680, they were given a plot of land outside of the city walls, where they built the new Jewish Quarter, al-Qāʻ (now Qāʻ al-ʻUlufi), and where they remained until the community's demise in the mid-20th century.<ref>Yosef Tobi (ed.), ''Studies in 'Megillat Teman' '' by Yiḥyah Salaḥ, The Magnes Press: Hebrew University, Jerusalem 1986, p. 67.</ref> In 1839 the Reverend [[Joseph Wolff]], who later went to [[Bukhara]] to attempt to save Lieutenant Colonel [[Charles Stoddart]] and Captain [[Arthur Conolly]], found in [[Yemen]], near [[Sana'a]], a tribe claiming to be descendants of Jehonadab.<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/easton/ebd2.html?term=Rechabites Rechabites] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201111220645/https://www.ccel.org/ccel/easton/ebd2.html?term=Rechabites |date=11 November 2020 }} – ''[[Easton's Bible Dictionary]]''</ref> After the creation of the political State of Israel in 1948, about 49,000 (of an estimated 51,000) of [[Yemenite Jews]] were airlifted to Israel, almost 10,000 of whom were from Sanaʽa (see the English-language book ''Jews and Muslims in lower Yemen: a study in protection and restraint, 1918–1949''). There was then essentially no Jewish population in Sanaʽa until the [[Houthi insurgency]] broke out in northern Yemen in 2004. The [[Houthis]] directly threatened the Jewish community in 2007, prompting the government of [[President Saleh]] to offer them refuge in Sanaʽa. {{As of|2010}}, around 700 Jews were living in the capital under government protection.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/persecuted-yemeni-jews-to-be-given-sanctuary-in-britain-1944075.html Persecuted Yemeni Jews to be given sanctuary in Britain] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029104507/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/persecuted-yemeni-jews-to-be-given-sanctuary-in-britain-1944075.html |date=29 October 2019 }}, ''The Independent'', 14 April 2010.</ref> In April 2017, it was reported that 40 of the last 50 Jews were in an enclave next to the American Embassy in Sana'a, and they were subject to threats of [[ethnic cleansing]] by the [[Houthis]].<ref name="Jewish Blog spot 17 April 2017">{{Cite web |url=http://jewishrefugees.blogspot.com/2017/04/houthis-ethnically-cleansing-last.html |title=Jewish Blog spot April 17, 2017. |access-date=7 July 2020 |archive-date=27 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200627115723/http://jewishrefugees.blogspot.com/2017/04/houthis-ethnically-cleansing-last.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Market Stall, Sanaa (10035122126).jpg|thumb|Market stall in Sanaa]]
Historically, Sanaʽa had a [[mining industry]].

As the capital city of Yemen, nearly 40% of jobs in Sanaʽa are in the [[public sector]].<ref name="City Development Strategy">{{cite book |title=Sana'a : A City Development Strategy |date=2009 |publisher=World Bank |url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/17679 |access-date=22 January 2022 |archive-date=23 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220123091344/https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/17679 |url-status=live }}</ref> The city is also an important centre for commerce and industry in Yemen.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/> Additionally, like many other cities in the developing world, Sanaʽa has a large [[informal sector]] that is estimated to constitute 32% of nongovernmental employment as of 2002.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/>

By far the largest area of the economy, both in terms of the number of businesses and jobs, is in commerce and small services.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/> As of 2004, 58.9% of all establishments and 31.3% of all jobs in Sanaa belong to this category.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/> Another major category is general administration, which only makes up 0.8% of employers but has 18.0% of workers, making it the second largest in that regard.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/> [[Manufacturing]] is the third-largest category by both measures, with about 12% for both.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/> Sanaa also has a higher concentration of hotels and restaurants than elsewhere in the country.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/>

About 62% of jobs in Sanaa are working for private, locally owned enterprises, followed by state-owned enterprises which employ 31%.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/> [[Waqf]]s, private foreign-owned companies, and private [[joint venture]]s make up the rest in that order, with none employing more than 2%.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/>

Sanaa's economy is large compared to its population: as of 2004, it was home to only 9% of Yemen's population but 16% of the country's businesses and 22% of its formal-sector jobs.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/> The average size of a business establishment in Sanaa is small, at 3.88 employees on average; however, this is higher than the national average of 2.87 and only Aden has a higher average of 6.88 employees.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/> Between 1992 and 2006, 39% of all new formal-sector jobs in Yemen were created in Sanaa, along with 33% of new business establishments.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/> In terms of jobs created, Sanaa is ahead of all other governorates in Yemen by a factor of three.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/>

===Poverty and income inequality===
While Sanaa has a vibrant, diverse economy with more jobs being created than anywhere else in Yemen, it also has the highest concentration of poverty in the country.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/> It is home to 6.5% of the country's total poor population and 23% of the poor urban population.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/> About 15% of the city's population lives below the national poverty line as of 2007.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/> There are also many people living just above the poverty line who are still in a relatively precarious financial position.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/> High [[unemployment]] is another problem; by some estimates, as much as 25% of Sanaa's potential workforce is unemployed.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/>

[[Income inequality]] is also increasing: from 1998 to 2005, the [[Gini coefficient]] for Sanaa increased from 37% to 44%: a 21% increase, the highest in the country.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/> High [[inflation]], low [[per capita income]] growth, and disproportionate gains by the rich have contributed to a [[middle class squeeze]] in Sanaa's middle class since the 1980s.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/>

===Challenges facing local businesses===
A 2005 survey of 488 Yemeni firms by the [[Mitsubishi Research Institute]] included a subset of 175 firms in Sanaa.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/> They reported similar challenges in doing business with firms throughout the country.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/> In particular, corruption is a problem in their dealings with the government, and hefty bribes are often a necessity.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/> Certain businesses can use their connections to dodge taxes and regulations, which puts other businesses at a disadvantage because they have to abide by the rules.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/> Long delays for customs clearances, especially for imports, are ubiquitous, and over 70% of the surveyed firms reported that they had made extra-legal payments to customs officials.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/> Financial constraints also confront many entrepreneurs in Sanaa: the cost of [[bank credit]] is also prohibitively high, and [[loan guarantee]]s often comes with heavy demands that are difficult to meet.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/> Shortcomings in municipal infrastructure are another problem: for example, because access to electricity is unreliable, many firms have to install their own [[backup generator]]s.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/>

===Energy===
Before the civil war, Yemen's electricity was primarily supplied by the [[Ma'rib]] gas-fired power plant, which came online in 2009 and supplied 27 to 40 percent of the country's electricity while active.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> (Before that, the power came from six diesel power plants in Sanaa itself.)<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> The Ma'rib plant is connected to the Bani Hushaysh substation by a power line with a capacity of 400 kV, and the Bani Hushaysh substation is then connected to substations in [[Dhahban]] and [[Hizyaz]] by two 132-kV lines.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> However, the Ma'rib-Sanaa power line was frequently targeted by attacks; there were 54 attacks on the power line between 2010 and 2013.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> The Ma'rib plant ceased operations in 2015.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/>

The Dhahban and Hizyaz substations also have generating capacity in addition to being supplied by the Ma'rib plant.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> The Dhahban station is the main one in Sanaa; located 10&nbsp;km northwest of the city, it had an original generating capacity of 20 MW, with another 30 MW installed during the 2000s, bringing the total to 50 MW.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> The Hizyaz station consists of three power plants: the first, with a capacity of 30 MW, was completed in 2002.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> Another 60 MW plant was added in 2004, and then in 2007 the third plant, with a capacity of 30 MW, was also completed.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/>

While most of prewar Sanaa was connected to the electrical grid, including at least partial coverage in most of the city's 35 informal settlements, access to electricity was unreliable.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> [[Power outage]]s were common, and one 2011 report suggested that electricity was only available for one hour per day.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/>

The civil war has severely impacted the energy sector in Yemen, due to several factors including damage from attacks, lack of funding for maintenance, and fuel shortages.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> As of 2018, 43% of Sanaa's energy assets were destroyed, while another 38% had suffered partial damage; in addition, 81% of the facilities were not functioning.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> As a result, the public power supply in Sanaa has become almost nonexistent: of the daily 500 MW electricity demand in the city, the city receives 40 MW.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> The public electricity supply is now mostly or entirely supplied by the Hizyaz station, whose capacity has been reduced to 7 MW.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> Public grid access covers around 2% of the population, mostly in nearby neighborhoods, and it is expensive for consumers.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> Private services using their generators also sell electricity to customers; they cover another 2.8% and cost about as much as the public supply.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> The largest share of electrical supply in Sanaa came from privately owned [[solar panels]] and diesel generators, which together covered 30% of the population.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> [[Solar power]] rapidly gained popularity in Yemen in 2015, and in 2016, it became the leading source of electricity in the country.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/>

Prices of fuel and diesel in Yemen have risen dramatically since the start of the war; current prices are 150% of what they were in 2017.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> The most recent crisis in Sanaa came in September 2019, leading to days-long lines at gas stations.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> Black market prices can be three times higher than the official ones, leaving many unable to afford fuel.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/>

Sanaa is relatively well-educated among Yemeni cities, and much more than the country as a whole.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/> [[Private education]] is highly desired by more affluent residents, but access to it is nowhere near as good as in other capital cities in the region.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/>

Each of Sanaa's districts has its educational district, with several government schools in each one.<ref name="Gahlan">{{cite news |last1=Gahlan |first1=Mohammed Yahya |title=Yemen war leaves harsh impact on education |url=https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2018/09/yemen-war-children-schools-education.html#ixzz5QdO7bpMs |access-date=15 April 2021 |work=Al-Monitor |date=2018 |archive-date=15 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210415032615/https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2018/09/yemen-war-children-schools-education.html#ixzz5QdO7bpMs |url-status=live }}</ref>

The war in Yemen has severely affected education in Sanaa.<ref name="Gahlan"/> After the internationally recognized government relocated the national bank from Sanaa to Aden in 2016, it stopped paying salaries to public-sector employees in Houthi-controlled areas.<ref name="Gahlan"/> Many teachers quit teaching because of this, and they were replaced by inexperienced volunteers.<ref name="Gahlan"/>

==Health==
As of October 2016, there are 88 health facilities in the Sanaa metro area.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> These include 5 primary-level health units (covering 1,000–5,000 people each), 56 health centres (covering over 50,000 people each — higher than the national average of 36,340, as well as the recommended standard of 5,000–20,000 per health centre), and 19 hospitals (covering on average some 390,000 people, over twice the recommended amount of 150,000 each).<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> The hospitals have on average 6.9 beds per 10,000 people, which is slightly above the national average of 6.2 but well below the recommended minimum of 10.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> As of 2016 there are also 25 [[ambulance]]s in the city.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> As of 2019, 77 healthcare facilities in Sanaa are supported by Health Cluster partners, including provision of [[outpatient consultation]]s, medical interventions, fuel and water support, and staff training.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/>

Sanaa's healthcare providers also serve people from surrounding governorates.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> It is one of two Yemeni cities offering [[tertiary healthcare]] services.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> The largest of the country's 6 [[blood transfusion]] centres is located at Sanaa's [[As-Sabeen Maternal Hospital]].<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> Additionally, most of Yemen's 40 providers of [[psychiatry|psychiatric care]] are located in Sanaa as of 2016.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/>

The ongoing conflict has severely affected the health sector in Sanaa.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> In 2018, the total cost of damage to the health sector in Sanaa was estimated to be between 191 million and US$233 million.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> As of 2016, there was a ratio of 20 healthcare workers for every 10,000 people; this ratio had decreased to 14 by 2018, well below the [[World Health Organization]]'s recommended minimum of 22 health staff per 10,000 people.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> There are severe shortages of medicines in Sanaa, with 57 types of [[cancer]] medicines and 8 kidney dialysis medicines being commercially unavailable.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> Those medicines that are available are subjected to large price increases.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> On 27 April 2018, As-Sabeen Maternal Hospital was hit by an airstrike and made inoperational.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> As of 2020, no information is available about its status.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/>

Additionally, the closure of [[Sanaa International Airport]] to commercial flights in August 2016 prevented Yemenis from traveling abroad to receive specialized medical treatment unavailable in the country.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> Before it shut down, an estimated 7,000 Yemenis traveled through the airport to do so, including treatment for heart, kidney, and liver conditions, blood conditions, and cancer.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/>

Sanaa was hit hard by the [[2016–2022 Yemen cholera outbreak|cholera outbreak in Yemen]] that lasted from 2016 to 2022, with [[Bani al-Harith District]] reporting the highest number of cases in January–August 2019.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> The Amanat al-Asimah governorate also had the second-highest number of [[measles]] cases in Yemen in 2019, behind only [[Saada Governorate]].<ref name="UN-Habitat"/>

===Coronavirus===
In May 2020, during the [[coronavirus pandemic]], the local Houthi authorities responded by closing down several markets and locking down streets in 10 districts after suspected cases rose.<ref name="AP Coronavirus">{{cite news |last1=Michael |first1=Maggie |title=Coronavirus spreads in Yemen with health system in shambles |url=https://apnews.com/article/d90f7e476595082159fed0a941ef0d48 |access-date=16 April 2021 |work=Associated Press |date=May 2020 |archive-date=16 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210416034009/https://apnews.com/article/d90f7e476595082159fed0a941ef0d48 |url-status=live }}</ref> At the same time, however, they have been suppressing all information about the scale of the outbreak, refusing to release positive test results and intimidating medical staff, journalists, and families to prevent them from speaking out about cases.<ref name="AP Coronavirus"/> Speaking about the coronavirus testing results, one official quipped, "When it's negative, they give the results to us."<ref name="AP Coronavirus"/> As of May 2020, the only hospital in Sanaa that has the full capacity to treat coronavirus is the [[List of hospitals in Yemen|Kuwait University Hospital]].<ref name="AP Coronavirus"/> An influx of patients entered this hospital in the first week of May, and health workers believe many of them had coronavirus; Houthi authorities never revealed the test results, but an internal document from 4 May 2020, showing three positive test results, was circulated widely on social media.<ref name="AP Coronavirus"/>

==Transport and communications==
[[File:Sana'a (2286828534).jpg|thumb|A few of Sanaa's many dababs]]
Transport in Sanaa is divided by gender, with a slight majority (51%) of male commuters using [[public transport]] and a similar majority (56%) of women travelling on foot.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> In both cases, using personally-owned [[car]]s was less prevalent than public transport (51% vs. 29% for men, and 25% vs. 20% for women).<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> Use of [[bicycle]]s and [[motorcycle]]s is less; only 5% of male commuters and a negligible percentage of female commuters reported using them as primary modes of transport.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/>

Public transport in Sanaa is primarily informal, with most vehicles being privately owned.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> Common passenger vehicles include [[microbus]]es (''dabab''s), which in 2005 were estimated to number 4-7,000 in Sanaa; [[minibus]]es ("nuss-bus"), estimated at 5,500–7,300; and [[taxi]]s, which are more common at around 33,000.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> Public transport in the city center is well-developed, with frequently available bus and minibus services and several bus terminals (most terminals are informal), but the Sanaa outskirts are poorly served by comparison and often people "must walk long distances to reach one of the major roads."<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> Most routes are short, meaning that longer north–south trips require switching buses multiple times.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> Additionally, the number of buses on the roads can vary from day to day, since bus driver licenses do not require drivers to operate on a regular schedule.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> This can lead to long waiting times.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> There are also coaches to major cities such as [[Aden]] and [[Taiz]].

Sanaa has an extensive road network, which is where most formal investment has taken place.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> The city's roads are mostly north–south, with two major ring roads traversing the city.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> The highest volumes of traffic are within the inner ring road.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> Roads are often congested, which is compounded by the fact that many of the city's 33,000 taxi cabs often operate empty, and there is a high level of [[air pollution]] as a result.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> This air pollution is exacerbated by the fact that, like [[Mexico City]] or [[Kathmandu]], Sanaa is located in an upland "bowl" surrounded by mountains, which creates [[thermal inversion]]s that trap pollutants.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/>

Sanaa has the most [[traffic accident]]s in Yemen, with 2,898 in 2013, more than twice as many as [[Ta'izz]] (which had the second-highest total).<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> Contributing factors include lax enforcement of traffic laws, lack of [[traffic signal]]s, lack of pedestrian crossings, and bad parking practices (for example, [[double parking]] is common, even when there are available parking spaces nearby).<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> The number of traffic accidents plummeted in 2015 by more than 50%, as the escalation of the conflict in Yemen led to reduced mobility, as well as fuel shortages which led to decreased use of personal vehicles.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/>

In 2017, the [[Saudi blockade of Yemen]] caused fuel costs to rise by over 100% in Sanaa, crippling transport systems and making it even harder for people to access clean water, food, and healthcare.<ref name="Oxfam2017"/> By August 2019, the price of diesel had reached 430 [[Yemeni riyal|riyal]]s per liter, which was a 186.7% increase from the pre-war price; at the same time, the price of [[gasoline]] had risen to 365 riyals per liter, which was a 143.3% increase over the same period.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/>

===Air transport===

===Communications===
{{main article|Telecommunications in Yemen}}
[[File:Internet Cafe in Sana'a.JPG|thumb|left|Internet cafe in Sanaa, 2006]]
Most of Yemen's telecommunications infrastructure is located in Sanaa, as are most of the country's telecommunications companies.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/>

The [[Internet]] was first launched in Yemen in 1996, but it was used by under 5% of the population until 2007.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> The percentage of Yemenis using the internet nationwide has increased from 1.25% in 2006 to 26.72% in 2017.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> In Sanaa, the main [[internet service provider]] is [[YemenNet]], which was launched in 2002 and is the only network offering 3G services.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/>

[[Internet cafe]]s are popular among Sanaa residents, many of whom cannot afford the high cost of subscription fees and purchasing necessary equipment.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> They are especially popular with university students, who use publicly available information on the internet to supplement their studies.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> The first all-female internet cafe in Sanaa opened in 2013.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> As of 2017, the city of Sanaa had 407 internet cafes, which was almost a third of the total in Yemen.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> A survey of 45 internet cafes in 2018 reported that 38 were fully or partially operating, while 7 were permanently closed.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> One of them was operating on solar power, which provided 18 hours of electricity per day.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/>

==Water and sanitation==
[[File:Water crisis in sana'a.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[UNICEF]] project to provide water in Sanaa, 2015]]
Yemen is one of the world's most water-scarce countries, and Sanaa could be the first national capital in the world to completely exhaust its water supply.<ref name="Water Conflict">{{cite journal |last1=Lichtenthaeler |first1=Gerhard |title=Water Conflict and Cooperation in Yemen |journal=Middle East Report |date=2010 |issue=254 |pages=30–35 |jstor=40660903 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40660903 |access-date=15 February 2021 |archive-date=15 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210415031242/https://www.jstor.org/stable/40660903 |url-status=live }}</ref> The city is located on the [[Tawilah aquifer]], which was first identified in 1972. The aquifer has a natural [[recharge rate]] of 42 Mm<sup>3</sup>/a, much of which comes from the periodic outflow of water from the surrounding wadis onto the Sanaa plain. There is not much refill from rainfall. In 1995, water extraction from the aquifer exceeded the natural recharge rate by around 300%.<ref name="Al-Hamdi"/> More recent estimates are higher, suggesting 400–500%.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> This has caused groundwater levels to drop by 6 to 8 metres annually,<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> to the point that many wells have to be drilled as far down as 2,600 to 3,900 feet.<ref name="Water Conflict"/> It is estimated that, with a slightly lower rate of depletion, the aquifer will be completely exhausted by around 2030.<ref name="Water Conflict"/><ref name="Al-Hamdi"/>

As much as 90% of Yemen's water use is in agriculture, with irrigated farmland increasing from 37,000 [[hectare]]s in 1970 to 407,000 in 2004.<ref name="Water Conflict"/> Before the 1970s, traditional agricultural practices had a sustainable balance of use and recharge.<ref name="Al-Hamdi"/><ref name="Water Conflict"/> Household water in Sanaa was supplied by shallow wells, and the relative scarcity of water led to people using [[gray water]] for watering gardens. Meanwhile, agriculture in the surrounding rural areas was watered by rainfall, with [[Terrace (earthworks)|terracing]] and flood diversion systems making as much as possible out of the limited rainwater.<ref name="Al-Hamdi"/> However, after the introduction of [[deep tube well]]s<ref name="Water Conflict"/> and the identification of the Tawilah aquifer,<ref name="Al-Hamdi"/> there was an explosion of agriculture in the Sanaa area.<ref name="Al-Hamdi"/><ref name="Water Conflict"/> By 1995, there were over 5,000 wells in the Sanaa area;<ref name="Al-Hamdi"/> as of 2010, the number was about 13,500.<ref name="Water Conflict"/> At the same time, traditionally grown, drought-resistant crops have been largely replaced by more water-intensive [[cash crop]]s such as citrus, bananas,<ref name="Water Conflict"/> grapes, vegetables,<ref name="Al-Hamdi"/> and especially [[khat|qat]], which as of 2010 accounted for 6% of Yemen's entire GDP.<ref name="Water Conflict"/> In the Sanaa area, 27% of all farmland was dedicated to growing qat;<ref name="Al-Hamdi"/> By 2010, the number had increased to around 50%.<ref name="Water Conflict"/>

In the city of Sanaa itself, there was a continuous expansion of [[tap water]] supply under the [[National Water and Sanitation Authority]] (NSWA) through the end of the 1990s, but it was outpaced by the city's growth. The public water supply only served 40–50% of Sanaa residents by 2000.<ref name="Al-Hamdi"/> The percentage has decreased in recent years: in 2009, it was estimated that 55% of residents were connected to the public water supply; in 2018, only 43% did.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> For residents without access to the municipal water network, the only option for drinking water is from tanker trucks, which is expensive.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/> Access to tap water is also inconsistent between neighborhoods, and even in places where there is public water, water pressure can be too low, resulting in unreliable access for some households.<ref name="Al-Hamdi"/> Most households have access to water for less than one full day per week.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> There are also problems with pipe leakage, with estimates ranging from 40% to 60% of water being lost due to leaks.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/>

Additionally, there are problems with water quality in Sanaa due to wastewater getting into water pipes and also leaching down into the aquifer.<ref name="Al-Hamdi"/> A 2018 study found the water exceeded the limits for dissolved solids and coliform bacteria, including ''[[E. coli]]''.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> Sana'nis tend to view the city's tap water as contaminated, choosing instead to buy filtered water in containers for drinking and cooking, which costs significantly more.<ref name="Al-Hamdi"/> Private kiosks using [[reverse osmosis]] to filter poor-quality groundwater are also popular.<ref name="Water Conflict"/>

As of 2009, the average domestic water consumption in Sanaa was just 30 to 50 liters per day, which is far below the usual amount for city dwellers in the Middle East.<ref name="City Development Strategy"/>

In the pre-modern era, Sanaa used an irrigation called [[ghayls]]. These ran from external towns in peripheral areas and brought water into the city. They were responsible for much of Sanaa's water supply for most of its history.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Sergeant |first1=R. B. |title=Sana'a: an Arabian Islamic City |last2=Lewcock |first2=Robert |publisher=The World of Islam Festival Trust |year=1983 |isbn=0-905-035-04-6 |chapter=The Ghayls of Sana'a}}</ref>

===Wastewater management===
The [[Sanitary sewer|sewer]] systems in Sanaa is over 500 kilometres long.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> There are two activated sludge [[water treatment plant]]s in the city: the main one, in Bani al-Harith District, was commissioned in 2000 and has a daily capacity of 50,500m<sup>3</sup>; the second, in [[al-Hashishiyah]], is much smaller with a capacity of 500m<sup>3</sup> and is dedicated to collecting wastewater from tankers.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> No damage was reported to the Bani al-Harith water treatment plant as of 2018, and it remains in operation, although overloaded and with some equipment in poor condition.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> The al-Hashishiyah facility has been out of operation since the start of the conflict.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/>

Only 40% of Sanaa's population is connected to wastewater services as of 2018 (down from 45% in 2014), and over half of the population relies on private [[cesspit]]s for wastewater disposal.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> The wastewater is then either absorbed into the ground or pumped out by either the city's Wastewater and Sanitation Local Corporation or by private services.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> Of Sanaa's 35 informal settlements, only two ([[Madhbah]] and [[Bayt Maiyad]]) are connected to the city's sewer system, while most of the others rely on cesspits.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> In one, [[Suq Shamlan]], sewage is dumped in an open hole.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/>

===Solid waste management===
It is estimated that 1500 tonnes of solid waste are generated each day in the Sanaa metro area.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> The city is mainly serviced by the [[al-Azraqayn landfill]], which also serves the surrounding [[Sanaa Governorate]] as well as [['Amran Governorate]].<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> The landfill has been in operation since the 1970s and has almost reached full capacity.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> There is no base or surface sealing at the site, so the [[leachate]] is not captured.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> A facility for the treatment of [[Biomedical waste#Treatment|healthcare waste]] exists at the al-Azraqayn landfill; the first of its type in Yemen, it was expected to open in March 2015, but due to the ongoing conflict and lack of electricity, the opening was delayed indefinitely.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/>

Since the escalation of the Yemeni civil war in 2015, the Azraqayn landfill has no longer been operating at full capacity.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> Waste collection was reduced to 30 trips per month, and only some of the collected waste made it from the transfer station to the landfill.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> The waste processing building at the al-Azraqayn site was destroyed in 2015, and the landfill's [[weighbridge]] is damaged and not operational.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> As of 2018, almost a third of the city's [[garbage truck]]s had been damaged during the fighting and another 18% were not operational.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> Most Sanaa neighborhoods in 2018 reported insufficient coverage by [[waste management]] services.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/> As of 2018, the city's waste collection services cover 70% of the city's population, which is higher than [[al-Hudaydah]] (50%) but lower than Aden (80%).<ref name="UN-Habitat"/>

As of August 2015, the city of Sanaa employed 19 people as [[waste picker]]s for use in [[recycling]]: 4 at al-Azraqayn and 15 (12 men and 3 boys) at Sanaa Transit Station.<ref name="UN-Habitat"/>
