'''Waterbury''' is a city in the U.S. state of [[Connecticut]]. Waterbury had a population of 114,403 as of the [[2020 United States census|2020 Census]].<ref name="USCensus2020" /> The city is {{convert|33|mi}} southwest of [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] and {{convert|77|mi}} northeast of [[New York City]]. Waterbury is the largest city in the [[Naugatuck Valley Planning Region, Connecticut|Naugatuck Valley Planning Region]] and second-largest city in [[New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven County]].

Throughout the first half of the 20th century, Waterbury had large industrial interests and was the leading center in the United States for the manufacture of brassware (including castings and finishings), as reflected in the nickname the "[[Brass]] City" and the city's motto ''Quid Aere Perennius?'' ("What Is More Lasting Than Brass?"). It was also noted for the manufacture of watches and clocks ([[Timex Group USA|Timex]]).

The city is alongside [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania–Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] (Yankee Expressway) and [[Connecticut Route 8|Route 8]] and has a [[Metro-North]] [[Waterbury (Metro-North station)|railroad station]] with connections to [[Grand Central Terminal]]. Waterbury is also home to [[Post University]] and the regional campuses of the [[University of Connecticut]], [[University of Bridgeport]], [[Western Connecticut State University]] as well as [[Naugatuck Valley Community College]].

==History==
[[File:PostcardWaterburyCTAGWestOptometristSoMainSt1905.jpg|thumb|South Main Street, {{circa|1910}}]]

The land was originally inhabited by [[Native Americans in the United States|the Algonquin bands]]. According to [[Samuel Orcutt]]'s history, some Puritan residents of nearby Farmington "found it expedient to purchase the same lands from different tribes, without attempting to decide between their rival claims."<ref name=Orcutt1>{{cite book|last1=Orcutt|first1=Samuel|title=The Indians of the Housatonic and Naugatuck Valleys|date=1882|publisher=Case, Lockwood & Brainard|location=Hartford|page=[https://archive.org/details/indianshousaton00orcugoog/page/n30 16]|url=https://archive.org/details/indianshousaton00orcugoog|access-date=November 10, 2015}}</ref> The original settlement of Waterbury in 1674 was in the area now known as the [[Town Plot Hill|Town Plot]] section. In 1675, the turbulence of [[King Philip's War]] caused the new settlement to be vacated until the resumption of peace in 1677. A new permanent location was found across the river to the east along the Mad River. The original [[Algonquin people|Native American]] inhabitants called the area "Matetacoke" meaning "the interval lands."<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Indians of the Housatonic and Naugatuck Valleys|url = http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100343706|publisher = Press of the Case, Lockwood & Brainard Co.|date = January 1, 1882|location = Hartford, Conn.|first = Samuel|last = Orcutt|page = 4|access-date = January 16, 2016|archive-date = February 5, 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160205093342/http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100343706|url-status = live}}</ref> Thus, the settlement's name was [[Anglicised]] to "Mattatuck" in 1673. When the settlement was admitted as the 28th [[New England town|town]] in the [[Connecticut Colony]] in 1686,<ref>Bronson, Henry (1858). ''The History of Waterbury, CT''. Bronson Bros. p. 4</ref> the name was changed to Waterbury in reference to the numerous streams that emptied into the [[Naugatuck River]] from the hills on either side of the valley.  At that time, it included all or parts of what later became the towns of [[Watertown, Connecticut|Watertown]], [[Plymouth, Connecticut|Plymouth]], [[Wolcott, Connecticut|Wolcott]], [[Prospect, Connecticut|Prospect]], [[Naugatuck, Connecticut|Naugatuck]], [[Thomaston, Connecticut|Thomaston]], and [[Middlebury, Connecticut|Middlebury]].

Growth was slow during Waterbury's first hundred years, the lack of [[arable land]] due to the constant flooding of the [[Naugatuck River]] in particular, discouraged many potential settlers.  Furthermore, the residents suffered through a great flood in 1691<ref>Bronson, Henry (1858). ''The History of Waterbury, CT''. Bronson Bros. p. 112</ref> and an outbreak of disease in 1712.  After a century, Waterbury's population numbered just 5,000.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The town and city of Waterbury, Connecticut|publisher = New Haven|date = January 1, 1896|first = Joseph|last = Anderson|hdl = 2027/hvd.32044025023904}}</ref>

Waterbury emerged as an early American industrial power in the early 19th century when the city began to manufacture [[brass]], harnessing the waters of the [[Mad River (Connecticut)|Mad River]] and [[Naugatuck River]] to power the early factories.<ref>{{cite web|title = Copper in the USA: US History|url = http://www.copper.org/education/history/us-history/g_fact_us.html|website = www.copper.org|access-date = January 16, 2016|archive-date = January 26, 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160126150254/http://www.copper.org/education/history/us-history/g_fact_us.html|url-status = live}}</ref><ref name=WaterburyObserver1>{{cite web|last1=Guest|first1=Raechel|title=Brass Beginnings|url=http://www.waterburyobserver.org/node/130|website=The Waterbury Observer|access-date=January 28, 2016|archive-date=February 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204091532/http://www.waterburyobserver.org/node/130|url-status=live}}</ref> The new brass industry attracted many immigrant laborers from all over the world, leading to an influx of diverse nationalities.<ref>{{cite web|title = Early 19th-Century Immigration in Connecticut {{!}} ConnecticutHistory.org|url = http://connecticuthistory.org/early-19th-century-immigration-in-connecticut/|website = connecticuthistory.org|access-date = January 16, 2016|archive-date = April 5, 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160405050744/http://connecticuthistory.org/early-19th-century-immigration-in-connecticut/|url-status = live}}</ref> Waterbury was incorporated as a city in 1853 and, as the "Brass Capital of the World", it gained a reputation for the quality and durability of its goods. Brass and copper supplied by Waterbury were used in [[Nevada]]'s [[Boulder Dam]] among myriad applications across the United States.

A famous Waterbury product of the late-19th century was [[Ingersoll Watch Company|Robert H. Ingersoll's]] one-dollar [[pocket watch]], five million of which were sold. After this, the clock industry became as important as Waterbury's brass industry. Evidence of these industries can still be seen in Waterbury, as numerous clocktowers and old brass factories have become landmarks of the city.

Waterbury produced silverware starting in 1858 by Rogers & Brother, and in 1886 by Rogers & Hamilton.<ref name="Hogan">Hogan, Edmund P. (1977).

In June 1920, [[labor unrest]] occurred, with striking workers fighting with police on the street. Over 30 were arrested, mostly [[Lithuanian Americans|Lithuanians]], [[Russians in America|Russians]], [[Polish Americans|Poles]], and [[Italian Americans|Italians]]. The strikers numbered some 15,000,<ref>{{cite web|title = Our History > Waterbury Connecticut Police Department|url = http://wtbypd.org/Media/Newsroom/tabid/59/ID/3/Our-History.aspx|website = wtbypd.org|access-date = January 16, 2016|archive-date = January 16, 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160116140428/http://wtbypd.org/Media/Newsroom/tabid/59/ID/3/Our-History.aspx|url-status = live}}</ref> with most being employed at Scovill, Chase Rolling Mill, and Chase Metal Works. One [[strike action|striker]] was shot to death by police.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Machine Guns out in Waterbury Riot|date = June 20, 1919|journal = New York Times}}</ref>

At its peak during [[World War II]], 10,000 people worked at the Scovill Manufacturing Co, later sold to Century Brass. The city's metal manufacturing mills (Scovill Manufacturing, Anaconda American Brass, and [[Chase Brass and Copper Company|Chase Brass & Copper]] were the largest) occupied more than 2&nbsp;million square feet (180,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) and more than 90 buildings.

On May&nbsp;24, 1962, the north side of the city was devastated by a [[Tornado outbreak sequence of May 14–June 1, 1962#Bunker Hill–Fairmount–Waterville–Wolcott–Southington, Connecticut|high-end F3&nbsp;tornado]] that caused widespread damage, destroyed numerous neighborhoods, and left one dead and 50&nbsp;injured.

===Neighborhoods===
Waterbury's neighborhoods are shaped by the history and geography of the city.

Ethnic communities distinguish the city's 25 neighborhoods. Clusters of shops at the street corners created villages within the city. For many people, home, work and community life was contained within their neighborhood. Downtown, a short walk away, was "the city", offering live theater, fancy stores, parades and spectacles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brasscitylife.org/ |title=brasscitylife.org |publisher=brasscitylife.org |access-date=December 24, 2012 |archive-date=August 28, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828112855/http://www.brasscitylife.org/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Waterbury has about 52,000 registered voters, of whom about 24,000 are Democrats. There are about 7,800 registered Republicans and the balance are largely unaffiliated, with a smattering belonging to minor parties.

[[John S. Monagan]], who was a prolific author in addition to his political responsibilities, served as Waterbury's mayor from 1943 to 1948. He also served as its district's congressional representative from 1959 to 1973. [[George Harlamon]], a member of the Waterbury Hall of Fame, was the city's 40th mayor. He served from 1969 to 1970 during a period of racial tension. The city is known for its hard-nosed political culture compared locally to [[Cook County, Illinois]], close elections, and a number of scandals.

Waterbury's scandalous past dates back to 1940, when Mayor T. Frank Hayes and 22 others were convicted of conspiracy to defraud the City of Waterbury. Hayes received a 10–15 year sentence and served six years. Ironically, the massive corruption scheme was exposed with the help of then comptroller Sherwood Rowland, grandfather of Gov. [[John G. Rowland]], who was convicted on corruption charges in 2004. What appeared to have been a defeat for Hayes was not really a victory for Pape, and the stage was set for further corruption in Waterbury in the second half of the 20th century. Waterbury was in serious financial straits due to years of mismanagement, resulting in the city's finances being taken over by the State of Connecticut. The State Oversight Board oversaw city business for several years and have since left following consecutive years of balanced budgets. In 1992 former Mayor [[Joseph Santopietro]] was sentenced to nine years in prison following a public corruption conviction.<ref>{{Cite web|date=June 13, 1992|title=Former Connecticut Mayor Gets Prison Term in Corruption Case|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-06-13-mn-164-story.html|access-date=January 12, 2021|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|archive-date=January 13, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210113191741/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-06-13-mn-164-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The successors to [[Philip Giordano]], former acting mayor [[Sam Caligiuri]] (2001) and former mayor [[Michael Jarjura]] (2001–2011) managed the city without major controversy since 2001. Democrat [[Neil O'Leary]] was elected the 46th Mayor of Waterbury on November 9, 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.ctnews.com/connecticutpostings/2012/08/30/finch-mayor-of-biggest-city-doesnt-earn-biggest-salary/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902052904/http://blog.ctnews.com/connecticutpostings/2012/08/30/finch-mayor-of-biggest-city-doesnt-earn-biggest-salary/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 2, 2012 |title=Finch, mayor of biggest city, doesn't earn biggest salary |publisher=ctnews.com |date=August 30, 2012 |access-date=December 16, 2012 }}</ref>

In 1939, Pape backed an attempt to install [[Council–manager government|council-manager government]] and [[Single transferable vote|single-transferable-vote]] elections. The local Republican Party and [[Connecticut General Assembly]] also supported this measure. New York Mayor [[Fiorello H. La Guardia]] helped campaign for its passage, having backed similar reforms in his own city in 1936.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Santucci|first=Jack|date=November 10, 2016|title=Party Splits, Not Progressives|journal=American Politics Research|language=en|volume=45|issue=3|pages=494–526|doi=10.1177/1532673x16674774|s2cid=157400899|issn=1532-673X}}</ref>

A number of presidential candidates have campaigned in Waterbury due to its pivotal role in statewide elections. The most famous was the election eve visit on the Green by [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1960. Forty thousand people waited until 3am on the Green to greet Kennedy on Sunday, November 6, 1960. Sen. Kennedy spoke to them from the balcony of the [[Elton Hotel|Roger Smith Hotel]] (now called the Elton). [[Pierre Salinger]] later said it was the greatest night of the campaign. In September 1984 [[Ronald Reagan]] held a huge noontime election rally at the same location. In July 2006 former president [[Bill Clinton]] made a campaign appearance at the [[Palace Theater (Waterbury, Connecticut)|Palace Theatre]] for Senator [[Joe Lieberman]] during his campaign for re-election to the [[U.S. Senate]]. Shortly after the Democratic primary, Tom Swan, campaign manager for Lieberman's opponent [[Ned Lamont]], described Waterbury as a place where "the forces of slime meet the forces of evil," after a large majority of the town's voters backed Lieberman. Swan claimed he was referring to former mayor [[Philip A. Giordano]] and former governor [[John G. Rowland]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rep-am.com/story.php?id=10980|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312192345/http://www.rep-am.com/story.php?id=10980|url-status=dead|title=Waterbury Republican-American article|archivedate=March 12, 2007}}</ref>

Governor John G. Rowland served ten months in a federal prison until February 10, 2006. He was released from federal prison with the stipulation that he serve four months house arrest with an electronic ankle bracelet monitor until June 2006.

In January 2008 Waterbury Mayor [[Michael Jarjura]] announced that he would hire Rowland as an economic development advisor for the city. Rowland began work in February that year receiving an annual salary of $95,000 as the city's economic development coordinator funded in conjunction with the Greater Waterbury Chamber of Commerce.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/24colct.html | work=The New York Times | title=For Rowland, Second Chance of a Lifetime | first=Woody | last=Hochswender | date=February 24, 2008 | access-date=May 27, 2010 | archive-date=April 25, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425084207/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/24colct.html | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1916&dat=20080124&id=MHZIAAAAIBAJ&pg=3454,996896|title=Disgraced ex-governor plans to take job in city with corrupt past|publisher=The Hour|date=January 24, 2008|access-date=December 24, 2012|archive-date=October 28, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211028221756/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1916&dat=20080124&id=MHZIAAAAIBAJ&pg=3454%2C996896|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2011, the Board of Aldermen voted to eliminate funding the city's portion of his salary and in November 2011 Rowland stated he would give up his position when his contract expired thus ending his quasi-city employment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rep-am.com/articles/2011/11/11/news/local/598649.txt|title=Rowland to give up czar post Republican American|work=rep-am.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115235705/http://www.rep-am.com/articles/2011/11/11/news/local/598649.txt|archive-date=November 15, 2011}}</ref>

Later that year, following his victory over then Mayor Jarjura, new mayor Neil O'Leary created the position of Economic Development Director as part of his new administration, removing the duties from the Chamber of Commerce and bringing them directly into City Hall, making Economic Development a cornerstone of his administration. Ron Pugliese was hired as the first director to hold the position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waterburyobserver.org/node/637|title=O'Leary Tabs Ronald Pugliese To Replace John Rowland As Director Of Economic Development In Waterbury|work=waterburyobserver.org|access-date=December 3, 2013|archive-date=July 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701033734/http://www.waterburyobserver.org/node/637|url-status=live}}</ref>
