'''Manchester''' is the [[List of municipalities in New Hampshire|most populous city]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Hampshire]] and the tenth most populous in [[New England]]. As of the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], it had a population of 115,644.<ref name="Census 2020">{{Cite web| url=https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=&g=0600000US3301145140&tid=DECENNIALPL2020.P1| title=Manchester city, Hillsborough County, New Hampshire: 2020 DEC Redistricting Data (PL 94-171)| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| access-date=December 1, 2021}}</ref>

Manchester is, along with the city of [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]], one of two [[county seat|seats]] of New Hampshire's most populous county, [[Hillsborough County, New Hampshire|Hillsborough County]]. Manchester lies near the northern end of the [[Northeast megalopolis]] and straddles the banks of the [[Merrimack River]]. It was first named by the merchant and inventor [[Samuel Blodgett|Samuel Blodget(t)]], eponym of Samuel Blodget Park and Blodget Street in the city's North End. His vision was to create a great industrial center similar to that of the original [[Manchester]] in England, which was the world's first industrialized city.<ref>[http://www.Citytowninfo.com/places/new-hampshire/manchester Manchester, New Hampshire] Publisher: CityTownInfo.com Retrieved: March 4, 2014.</ref>

During the [[Industrial Revolution in the United States|Industrial Revolution]], Manchester was a major industrial and economic hub for New England, with the [[Amoskeag Manufacturing Company]] being the largest [[cotton]] textile plant in the world.<ref name=nhpr>{{Cite news| url=https://www.nhpr.org/post/new-hampshires-immigration-story-come-amoskeag| title=New Hampshire's Immigration Story - Come to Amoskeag!| last1=Shields| first1=Keith| date=May 23, 2012| publisher=NH Public Radio| access-date=August 19, 2020}}</ref> After [[World War II]], many textile manufacturing jobs left Manchester, but new industries and companies were introduced to the city, such as [[DEKA (company)|DEKA]].

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Manchester, New Hampshire}}

The native [[Pennacook]] people called [[Amoskeag Falls]] on the Merrimack River—the area that became the heart of Manchester—''Namaoskeag'', meaning "good fishing place".<ref>{{cite book| url=https://archive.org/details/manchesterbriefr00clar_0| title=Manchester: A Brief Record of Its Past and a Picture of Its Present, Including an Account of Its Settlement and of Its Growth as a Town and City; a History of Its Schools, Churches, Societies, Banks| publisher=J. B. Clarke| last=Clarke| first=J.B.| date=1875| page=[https://archive.org/details/manchesterbriefr00clar_0/page/11 11]}}</ref> In 1722, [[John Goffe|John Goffe III]] settled beside [[Cohas Brook]], later building a dam and sawmill at what was dubbed "Old Harry's Town". It was granted by [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]] in 1727 as "Tyngstown" to veterans of [[Queen Anne's War]] who served in 1703 under Captain William Tyng.<ref name=brit>{{cite web|url = https://www.britannica.com/place/Manchester-New-Hampshire|title = Manchester, New Hampshire|date = December 2, 2014|access-date = June 22, 2015|website = Encyclopædia Britannica Online|publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref> But at New Hampshire's 1741 separation from Massachusetts, the grant was ruled invalid and substituted with [[Wilton, Maine]], resulting in a 1751 rechartering by Governor [[Benning Wentworth]] as "Derryfield"—a name that lives on in Derryfield Park, Derryfield Country Club, and the private [[Derryfield School]].<ref name=brit/>

In 1807, Samuel Blodget opened a canal and lock system to allow vessels passage around the falls, part of a network developing to link the area with [[Boston]]. He envisioned a great industrial center arising, "the Manchester of America", in reference to [[Manchester]], England, then at the forefront of the [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref name=brit/><ref name="Samson">{{Cite book|title = Manchester: The Mills and the Immigrant Experience|last = Samson|first = Gary|publisher = Arcadia Publishing|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0-7385-0477-3|location = Portsmouth, New Hampshire}}</ref>{{rp|13–18}} In 1809, [[Benjamin Prichard]] and others built a water-powered cotton spinning mill on the western bank of the Merrimack. Apparently following Blodgett's suggestion, Derryfield was renamed "Manchester" in 1810, the year the mill was incorporated as the [[Amoskeag Manufacturing Company|Amoskeag Cotton & Woolen Manufacturing Company]].<ref>Tamara K. Hareven, ''Amoskeag: Life and Work in an American Factory City''</ref> It would be purchased in 1825 by entrepreneurs from Massachusetts, expanded to three mills in 1826, and then incorporated in 1831 as the [[Amoskeag Manufacturing Company]].<ref name=brit/><ref name=Samson/>{{rp|13–18}}

Amoskeag engineers and architects planned a model [[company town]] on the eastern bank, founded in 1838 with Elm Street as its main thoroughfare. Incorporation as a city followed for Manchester in 1846, soon home to the largest cotton mill in the world—Mill No. 11, stretching {{convert|900|ft|m}} long by {{convert|103|ft|m}} wide, and containing 4,000 looms. Other products made in the community included shoes, cigars, and paper. The Amoskeag foundry made rifles, sewing machines, textile machinery, fire engines, and locomotives in a division called the [[Amoskeag Locomotive Works]] (later, the [[Manchester Locomotive Works]]). The rapid growth of the mills demanded a large influx of workers, resulting in a flood of immigrants, particularly [[French Canadians]]. Many current residents descend from these workers. In 1871, the arch dam was built on the Merrimack River, enhancing the mill's water power delivery system. By 1912, the production of woven cloth in the Millyard had reached a production rate of 50 miles in length per hour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhptv.org/kn/itv/ournh/ournhtg10.htm|title = Our New Hampshire - Manchester and the Amoskeag}}</ref>

Throughout the late 19th century and the early 20th century, the city began to expand outward, and many streetcar suburbs such as Mast Road were built. Manchester was formerly home to a streetcar network, the Manchester Street Railway. The streetcar network was replaced with a bus network in the 1940s.

In 1922, 17,000 workers from two of the city's largest companies (Amoskeag and Stark Manufacturing Companies) [[1922 New England Textile Strike|went on strike for a period of nine months]]. After the strike, the textile industry began a slow decline, with the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] hitting the city particularly hard. The Amoskeag Manufacturing Company declared [[bankruptcy]] in 1935. During the Great Flood of 1936, the McGregor Bridge was destroyed and $2.5 million of damage was incurred to the city's mills and buildings. After the flood, the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company reorganized out of bankruptcy as Amoskeag Industries, diversifying its manufacturing operations with new industries in the Millyard.<ref>{{Cite web |title=MANCHESTER_MASTER_PLAN_FINAL_JULY_21 |url=https://www.manchesternh.gov/Portals/2/Departments/PCD/MANCHESTER_MASTER_PLAN_FINAL_JULY_21.PDF#page=36 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210809160410/https://www.manchesternh.gov/Portals/2/Departments/PCD/MANCHESTER_MASTER_PLAN_FINAL_JULY_21.PDF |archive-date=2021-08-09 |url-status=live |access-date=March 5, 2022 |website=Manchesternh.gov |publisher=The City of Manchester |page=36}}</ref>

Manchester's economy benefitted from [[World War II]], as the city was already well-positioned and equipped with industry to handle war-time production. In 1941, [[Manchester–Boston Regional Airport|Grenier Field]], on the city's border with [[Londonderry, New Hampshire|Londonderry]], was converted to a [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army air base]].

The city faced a decline in manufacturing in the 1950s and 1960s, with many Millyard buildings becoming abandoned during this time. An anthrax incident in 1957 led to the abandonment and later razing of the Arms Textile Mill along the river (today a parking lot in front of Arms Park).<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2017-06-19/anthrax-in-manchester-revisiting-the-arms-mill-outbreak-of-1957 | title=Anthrax in Manchester: Revisiting the Arms Mill Outbreak of 1957 | date=June 19, 2017 }}</ref> As part of [[urban renewal]] projects, the city filled in the Millyard canals to make room for roads and demolished several mill structures to make way for parking and roads. [[The Mall of New Hampshire]] opened in 1977, leading to further decline of downtown. However, during this time several important buildings were constructed in the downtown area, including the Hampshire Plaza in 1972 (the tallest building in New Hampshire until 1994, later renamed Brady Sullivan Plaza).

The 1980s brought renewed interest in the Millyard and downtown. The [[University of New Hampshire at Manchester]] opened a campus in the Millyard during this time, and [[Segway]] inventor [[Dean Kamen]] purchased two old mill buildings which became the headquarters for [[DEKA (company)|DEKA]]. Kamen purchased more buildings in 1984 and 1991, aiming to convert the Millyard into a high-tech center for smart manufacturing and offices. John Madden, a local developer, and Kamen worked with the city to implement capital improvements to the Millyard in the 1980s and early 1990s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/02/what-works-manchester-new-hampshire-renaissance-213639/ |title = How a 19th-Century Town Became a New Millennium Marvel |website = [[Politico]]|date = February 18, 2016 }}</ref>

[[City Hall Plaza (Manchester)|City Hall Plaza]] was built in downtown Manchester in 1992, to this day the tallest building in New Hampshire and northern New England. In 1991, the city went into economic decline as four major banks were shut down by federal regulators. Many shops and restaurants along the Elm Street thoroughfare closed during this time, as foot traffic declined. At the turn of the century, renewed interest in the Millyard led to a boom in development and business. Several high-tech firms opened offices or relocated to the Manchester Millyard in the 2000s, including [[Autodesk]] in 2000 and [[Dyn (company)|Dyn]] in 2004. Brady Sullivan, a local real estate developer, opened its first Millyard apartments in 2013.

Manchester has continued to grow steadily and transform itself into a cultural and commerce hub for the state of New Hampshire.

[[Massabesic Lake]] is on the eastern border. The highest point in Manchester is atop Wellington Hill, where the elevation reaches {{convert|570|ft|m}} above [[sea level]].

===Neighborhoods===
{{Main|Neighborhoods in Manchester, New Hampshire}}
The Manchester Planning Board, in its 2010 Master Plan, defines 25 neighborhoods within the city.

The major neighborhoods, historically, include Amoskeag, Rimmon Heights, Notre Dame/McGregorville and Piscataquog/Granite Square, also known as "Piscat", on the West Side; the North End, Janeville/Corey Square, Hallsville and Bakersville on the East Side; and Youngsville and Goffes Falls on the periphery of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/rumsey/Size4/D0115/2023042.jpg?userid=15&username=lunaadmin&resolution=4&servertype=JVA&cid=8&iid=RUMSEY&vcid=NA&usergroup=Rumsey3x&profileid=13 |title=Map |website=davidrumsey.com}}</ref>

In 2007, the city began a Neighborhood Initiatives program to "insure that our neighborhoods are vibrant, livable areas since these are the portions of the city where most of the residents spend their time living, playing, shopping and going to school."<ref>[http://www.yourmanchesternh.com/plans-and-projects/current-projects.aspx City of Manchester: Current Projects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818165507/http://www.yourmanchesternh.com/plans-and-projects/current-projects.aspx |date=August 18, 2010}}.

 }}</ref> The [[Mall of New Hampshire]], on Manchester's southern fringe near the intersection of Interstates 93 and 293, is the city's main retail center. In 2001, the [[Verizon Wireless Arena]], a venue seating more than 10,000, opened for major concerts and sporting events, enhancing the city's downtown revitalization efforts with a major hotel and convention center already in place across the street from the arena. The building was renamed the [[SNHU Arena]] in 2016, after Manchester's [[Southern New Hampshire University]].

Manchester is the home of [[Segway PT|Segway, Inc.]], manufacturers of a two-wheeled, self-balancing electric vehicle invented by [[Dean Kamen]].

===Downtown===
Downtown Manchester's [[City Hall Plaza (Manchester)|One City Hall Plaza]] stands 22 stories high, quickly followed by the all-black, 20-story Brady Sullivan Plaza, formerly known as the Hampshire Plaza. They are the tallest New England buildings north of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. The Sullivan Plaza is shorter than City Hall Plaza by a mere {{convert|16|ft}}. Other major buildings include the 18-story Wall Street Apartments tower; the 14-story, recently renamed Brady Sullivan Tower, which was the former New Hampshire Insurance building; the 12-story [[DoubleTree]] Hotel and Convention Center Manchester (which serves the SNHU Arena across the street), the Carpenter Center (a former hotel), and the Hampshire Towers condominium building; the 10-story Citizens Bank Building, which was, for much of the early- and mid-20th century, Manchester's iconic Amoskeag Bank "skyscraper"; and several high-rises of or exceeding 10 stories on the city's West Side. This partial list only includes residential and commercial buildings and does not include hospitals, spires and domes, etc.

The [[SNHU Arena]] has become the centerpiece of downtown Manchester. The venue can seat slightly less than 12,000 patrons for concerts, and at least 10,000-seat configurations for sporting and other forms of entertainment. It has also hosted major recording artists and comedians, national touring theatrical productions, family-oriented shows, and fairs since it opened in 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.verizonwirelessarena.com/arena_info/default.asp |title=V e R I Z O N .

Historic [[Gill Stadium]] supported professional minor-league baseball into the early 21st century and continues to be a viable and popular downtown venue for many sporting and entertainment events, seating nearly 4,000 patrons, depending on the event format.

In recent years there has been continual redevelopment of the Amoskeag Millyard and its residential Historic District. The increasing popularity of downtown living has caused many properties originally built as tenement housing for mill workers in the 19th century to be converted to stylish, eclectic residential condominiums. Many new retail stores and higher education institutions, including the [[University of New Hampshire at Manchester]], have been uniquely retro-fitted into properties along Commercial and Canal Street.

===Shopping===
Manchester has three main retail areas: downtown Manchester, South Willow Street (NH Route 28), and Second Street (NH Route 3A) on the West Side. The [[Mall of New Hampshire]] is on South Willow Street, and, with more than 125 stores, is one of the largest shopping centers in southern New Hampshire and central New England.

==Arts and culture==
[[File:Currier Art Museum, Manchester, NH MG 2792.JPG|thumb|right|[[Currier Museum of Art]] at 150 Ash Street]]

Cultural landmarks include the historic [[Palace Theatre (Manchester, New Hampshire)|Palace Theatre]], the [[Currier Museum of Art]], the [[New Hampshire Institute of Art]], the Franco-American Center, the Manchester Historic Association Millyard Museum, the Massabesic Audubon Center, the Amoskeag Fishways Learning and Visitors Center, the Lawrence L.

Kalil House|Kalil House]] designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], and the [[SEE Science Center]].<ref>{{cite web|title=SEE Science Center|url=https://www.see-sciencecenter.org|access-date=September 1, 2017}}</ref> [[Valley Cemetery]], the resting place of numerous prominent citizens since 1841, is an early example of a garden-style burial ground.

The [[John F. Kennedy Memorial Coliseum]] is another, smaller venue in downtown Manchester with a capacity of approximately 3,000 seats. It was completed in 1963, serves as home ice for the Manchester Central and Memorial High School hockey teams, and is home to the Southern New Hampshire Skating Club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchesternh.gov/Departments/ParksandRecreation/ParksFacilities/JFKMemorialColiseum.aspx|title=JFK Memorial Coliseum|first=City of Manchester NH Official Web|last=Site}}</ref>

The nickname "ManchVegas" was derived from illegal gambling in local businesses during the late 1980s or early 1990s. Many pizza shops and local bars had video poker machines that would pay out real money. The nickname was coined following a citywide campaign of law enforcement. It was then adopted as a lampoon of the city's limited entertainment opportunities. The term has since become a source of pride as the city's entertainment scene has grown.

==Sports==
The city is home to [[McIntyre Ski Area]], which opened in 1971. There are also college sports teams that play in and out of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.snhu.edu/sports-and-recreation.asp|title = SNHU Athletics|access-date = April 29, 2015|website = Southern New Hampshire University - Official Website|publisher = SNHU|archive-date = April 24, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150424114519/http://www.snhu.edu/sports-and-recreation.asp|url-status = dead}}</ref> [[Saint Anselm College]] is located less than a mile outside the city's border in Goffstown, although it has a Manchester postal address, and [[Southern New Hampshire University]] is located primarily in Hooksett, but has its campus partially within city limits.

==Government==
{{see also|List of mayors of Manchester, New Hampshire|Mayoral elections in Manchester, New Hampshire}}

Manchester is incorporated as a city under the laws of the state of New Hampshire, and operates under a strong mayoral form of government. The mayor serves as chairman of the fourteen-member Board of Mayor and Aldermen, the city's legislative body. Each of Manchester's twelve wards elects a single alderman, and two additional at-large members are elected citywide. [[Jay Ruais]] is the current [[List of mayors of Manchester, New Hampshire|mayor]].

The mayor also serves as the chair of the board of school committee. Like the board of aldermen, the school board has twelve members elected by ward and two at-large members. The school board is not a city department; rather, it is a school district coterminous with the city, which obtains financing from the Board of Mayor and Aldermen.

In the [[New Hampshire Senate]], Manchester is represented by three state senators:

* [[Keith Murphy]] (Republican-District 16): includes Manchester Ward 1 
* [[Donna Soucy]] (Democrat-District 18): Wards 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
* [[Lou D'Allesandro]] (Democrat District 20): Wards 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12

In the [[Executive Council of New Hampshire|New Hampshire Executive Council]], Manchester is included within the 4th District and is represented by Republican [[Ted Gatsas]],<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.nh.gov/council/districts/d4/index.htm| title=District 4: Councilor Theodore L. Gatsas| publisher=State of New Hampshire| access-date=January 10, 2019}}</ref> the city's former mayor. Manchester is included within [[New Hampshire's 1st congressional district]] and is represented by Democrat [[Chris Pappas (American politician)|Chris Pappas]].

At the presidential level, Manchester leans Democratic. [[George W. Bush]] narrowly carried the city by 170 votes in [[2004 United States presidential election in New Hampshire|2004]], but no other presidential elections since then have been nearly as close. In [[2020 United States presidential election in New Hampshire|2020]], [[Joe Biden]] won the highest percentage of the vote in Manchester since [[1964 United States presidential election in New Hampshire|1964]].

The [[Manchester Transit Authority]] runs several local bus routes throughout the city and surrounding areas, and operates three regional bus routes called the Zip Line service, which offers express service from Manchester to Concord, Nashua, and [[Salem, New Hampshire]].<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://mtabus.org/manchester-transit-routes-and-schedules/| title=Routes/Schedules| publisher=Manchester Transit| access-date=November 30, 2023}}</ref> [[Greyhound Lines]] operates bus service between Manchester and destinations in the Northeast.<ref>{{cite web |title=Peter Pan Manchester, NH Station |url=https://peterpanbus.com/locations/new-hampshire/manchester/ |website=Peter Pan |access-date=29 November 2023}}</ref>

====Passenger rail====
Into the 1950s, numerous [[Boston and Maine Railroad]] trains operated out of [[Manchester Union Station]], going to points northwest as far as [[Montreal]], north to [[Woodsville, New Hampshire|Woodsville]], east to [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]] and south to [[Boston]], among these the ''[[Alouette (train)|Alouette]]'' and the ''[[Ambassador (B&M train)|Ambassador]]'' (both of these being Boston - Montreal trains).<ref>{{cite journal |title=Boston & Maine Railroad, Tables 1, 2, 4, 7, 19, 37, 38|journal=Official Guide of the Railways |publisher=National Railway Publication Company |volume=82 |issue=8 |date=January 1950}}</ref> The last services were a once a day train between Boston and [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]]; this service ended in 1967.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Boston & Maine Railroad, Table 1|journal=Official Guide of the Railways |publisher=National Railway Publication Company |volume=100 |issue=2 |date=July 1967}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Boston & Maine Railroad, Table 1|journal=Official Guide of the Railways |publisher=National Railway Publication Company |volume=100 |issue=5 |date=October 1967}}</ref>

A proposed extension of the [[MBTA Commuter Rail|MBTA Commuter Rail's]] [[Lowell Line]] would see MBTA Commuter Rail service running as far north as Manchester with service frequencies similar to that of the current Lowell Line. A study currently being carried out by [[AECOM]] and the State of New Hampshire to design and make a financial plan for the project is due to be completed by 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nashua - Manchester 40818 {{!}} Project Specific Information {{!}} Project Center {{!}} NH Department of Transportation |url=https://www.nh.gov/dot/projects/nashuamanchester40818/index.htm |access-date=2022-11-16 |website=www.nh.gov}}</ref> The proposed Manchester station location would be located behind the [[Market basket|Market Basket]] grocery store on Elm Street.<ref>[https://www.nh.gov/dot/projects/nashuamanchester40818/documents/40818-pre-11172021.pdf Nashua‐Manchester (Capitol Corridor) Project Development Phase] November 17, 2021 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221212093635/https://www.nh.gov/dot/projects/nashuamanchester40818/documents/40818-pre-11172021.pdf|date=December 12, 2022}}</ref>

With the expansion of [[Interstate 93]] to eight lanes from [[Salem, New Hampshire|Salem]] to Manchester under construction, space is being reserved in the median for potential future commuter or light rail service along this corridor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rebuildingi93.com/content/faq/|title=Rebuilding I93: Salem to Manchester (NHDOT)—Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.)|first=CHA for New Hampshire Department of|last=Transportation|access-date=2006-11-17|archive-date=2007-07-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702165357/http://www.rebuildingi93.com/content/faq/|url-status=dead}}</ref> The I-93 transit study also suggested restoring service on the Manchester and Lawrence branch for commuter and freight rail.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nh.gov/dot/org/aerorailtransit/railandtransit/documents/nhstaterailplan.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907191611/http://www.nh.gov/dot/org/aerorailtransit/railandtransit/documents/nhstaterailplan.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-07 |url-status=live |title=Rail plan|website=nh.gov}}</ref> This corridor would support freight rail along with commuter, something that light rail cannot do.

In late 2011, [[Dean Kamen]], inventor of the [[Segway PT|Segway]] and owner of several buildings in the Millyard, as well as co-founder of [[For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology|FIRST]], proposed a rail loop for downtown and the Millyard. Several meetings have been held with area business and property owners, city officials and local developers, but the idea is in the early conceptual stages.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20161012110553/https://livablemht.org/2012/01/17/livable-dean-kamen-proposes-downtown-rail-loop/ Livable: Dean Kamen proposes downtown rail loop]. LivableMHT (January 17, 2012). Retrieved on January 21, 2021.</ref>

The downtown rail loop, if approved by the Board of Mayor and Aldermen, would be about three miles long. The loop would go from the Manchester Millyards, down south for about half a mile, then turn over Elm Street, separate into two rails (the other going towards [[Manchester-Boston Regional Airport]]), and climb north to Bridge Street, ending at the Brady Sullivan Tower at the northern end of Elm Street. More concrete plans were revealed in 2018.<ref>[https://www.nh.gov/dot/programs/public-private-partnership/documents/millyard-application.pdf Public Private Partnership] Fuss & O'Neil.</ref>

In 2021, Amtrak announced plans to implement new service from Boston to Concord, including a stop at Manchester, by 2035.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amtrakconnectsus.com/vision/|title=Vision|website = Amtrak Connects Us | access-date=April 15, 2021 | date=April 2, 2021}}</ref>
