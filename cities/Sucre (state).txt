Sucre State covers a total surface area of {{cvt|11,800|km2}} and, as of the 2011 census, had a population of 896,921. The most important river in the state is the [[Manzanares River (South America)|Manzanares River]].

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2022}}
[[File:Castillo San Antonio de la Eminencia.jpg|thumb|San Antonio de la Eminencia Castle, built between 1659 and 1686]]

This Venezuelan State has great historical importance, because it was the first Venezuelan land that was touched by the European navigator [[Christopher Columbus]]. The latter, impressed by the greenness of the flora, the coasts and the crystalline water of its beaches, called the place "Tierra de Gracia".

===Spanish colonization===
The capital of the state is Cumaná, which was founded by Gonzalo de Ocampo in 1521, although Franciscan missionaries began to populate it in 1515. In 1530 it was hit by an earthquake, so it had to be rebuilt. On July 2, 1591, King Philip II of Spain granted Cumaná the title of city.
[[File:Araya 137.jpg|thumb|Araya Castle, a fortress built by the Spanish between 1623 and 1630]]
In 1639, conflicts appeared in the Cumanacoa Valley, as the well-known conqueror Juan de Urpín, incorporated Cumanacoa into the territory of his ephemeral Governorate of New Barcelona and obtained authorization to found a colony there. On 18 February 1643 he founded the colony and gave it the name of Santa María de Cumanacoa. Some time later, the Cumanagoto tribe took over the colony and disappeared without a trace.

In the year 1700, by mandate of his Majesty Felipe V, he sent Captain Pedro Antonio Arias y González Manso to resolve the conflict in the Valley. An armed struggle begins with the indigenous tribe Cumanagotos, which maintained control of the Valley. Positioning their ships in Carúpano, the siege began up to the Valley of Cumanacoa, a conflict that lasted two years that ended up restoring order and the recovery of all the lands by the Spanish Empire, with the surrender of the indigenous tribes of the region and especially the Cumanagoto, the region of the Valley remains under the control of Captain Pedro Antonio Arias and Gonzalez Manso. 
[[File:Calle Independencia Casco Histórico.jpg|thumb|Colonial architecture in Carupano, Sucre state]]
King Felipe V, pleased with this service to the Spanish Empire, sends him Royal orders to establish himself permanently in the Valley with special powers of Governance, Justice and Commerce and to make it a territory that is not subject to the Governor of the Province of Nueva Andalucía and Nueva Barcelona as well as his appointment as Señorío de San Baltazar de los Arias. In 1705 Captain Pedro Antonio Arias y González Manso founded the region of El Valle with the name of San Baltasar de los Arias, which was definitively preserved until the days of the dictatorship of General Juan Vicente Gomez.

In 1726, the Province of Cumaná was composed of Cumaná, Guayana, Barcelona, Maturín and the island of Trinidad. This organization disintegrated as Guiana and Barcelona became independent provinces. In the year 1777, the Captaincy General of Venezuela was created, formed by seven provinces, among which was Cumaná.

===Contemporary era===
After the events of Caracas in April 1810, commissioners entered Cumaná, a meeting was called to establish a Provisional Board that took over the government of the Province. When Gran Colombia was dissolved and José Antonio Páez assumed the presidency of Venezuela, the country was divided into 11 provinces, one of which was Cumaná. In 1853, an earthquake once again destroyed a large part of the city.
[[File:Jose Antonio de Sucre.JPG|thumb|[[Antonio José de Sucre]], Grand Marshal of Ayacucho, one of Venezuela's national heroes]]
In 1891 the so-called Great State of Bermúdez was created, until 1898, when it finally adopted the name of "State of Sucre". In 1901 the State of Sucre was created, separated from Maturín, and in 1904 it was integrated again to the State of Bermúdez. By 1909 the limits of the States of Sucre and Monagas were definitively drawn as two separate entities.

The Cariaco earthquake in 1997 is considered the most serious to have occurred in Venezuela since the earthquake that affected the city of Caracas on July 27, 1967. In this last earthquake, the surface rupture that occurred in the Pilar Fault segment was particularly irregular, with cosmic displacements of approximately 0.25 m and a process of soil shaking recorded on the coast line.

==Geography==
The State of Sucre is located in the east of Venezuela. It borders the Caribbean Sea to the north, the States of Monagas and Anzoátegui to the south, the Gulf of Paria to the east and the Gulf of Cariaco to the west. The name of this Venezuelan State is a tribute to the hero of independence, Grand Marshal [[Antonio José de Sucre]], who was born in the city of Cumaná, which is the current capital of the State. It has an area of 11,800 square kilometers, representing 1.28% of the national total of Venezuela.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

The state of Sucre is located almost in the eastern cordillera; in the northern part is the double peninsula, which in the east is the [[Paria Peninsula|peninsula of Paria]] and in the west is the [[Araya Peninsula|peninsula of Araya]], dividing the slopes of the rivers, which flow into the gulfs of Paria and Cariaco, respectively. The main heights of the Eastern Cordillera are Cerro Negro, Peonia, Majagual and Arrempuja, all of them at more than 1900 m., being its highest point the Turimiquire peak with its almost 2600 m.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

===Hydrography===
Some of the most important rivers in the State of Sucre are the following
[[File:Pozo agual la ceiba parroquia bideau.jpg|thumb|Pozo Agual, Sucre State]]
Ríos Neverí (117&nbsp;km.), which crosses the city of Barcelona, Mochima and Manzanares, the latter of 81&nbsp;km. and passes through the capital city of Cumaná. All of them flow into the Caribbean Sea.

In the Gulf of Cariaco, one of the main rivers of the State, the Carinicuao or Cariaco, which is 173&nbsp;km long, pours its waters. Of lesser importance, but also from the same basin are the Cautaro, Tunantal, Guaracayal, Compondrón, San Pedro and Marigüitar.
In the Caribbean Sea basin, rivers of lesser importance such as the Chaure, Caribe, Unare and Cumaná flow into the river.
Finally, after traveling 173&nbsp;km, the San Juan river deposits its waters in the Gulf of Paria, as do the Irapa, Aruca, Güiria, Guiramo, Grande, Manacal and Yoco rivers.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

===Relief===
The relief of Sucre State is formed especially by mountainous landscapes, with some valleys not very extensive. The Turimiquire mountain range, to the southwest, shows a rough relief, with steep slopes and heights reaching 2500 meters, while the mountainous system of the Paria Peninsula is characterized by hills of lower elevation. The coast of Sugarcane, essentially towards the west, has all the characteristics of a sinking coast, deep, with large cliffs and scarce beach formation. In contrast, towards the southeast of the entity, in the Gulf of Paria, the land is very flat, with slopes of less than 1% and with insufficient drainage, which has turned it into swampy plains.
[[File:Cordillera al Mar.jpg|thumb|Paria Peninsula, Sucre State]]

===Vegetation===
The vegetation of Sucre State is xerophytic in the coastal areas and mountainous in the rural areas located in the Coastal Range, we can also find Caribbean beach plants and trees, such as coconut and cocoa trees. You can also find the oak tree, which has been declared a State tree.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

In Paria the vegetation ranges from cloud forest at 1000 meters and annual rainfall calculated between 1000 and 1500 millimeters, to xerophytic as we approach the coast. Its warm and rainy climate is conducive to vegetation, which according to experts is home to species transported by the waters of the Orinoco River from Guyana and native species, which are only found in this area (endemic)."{{cn|date=December 2022}}

===Fauna===
[[File:Posando para el Atardecer.JPG|thumb|Pelicans in San Juan de Las Galdonas, Sucre state]]
The conditions that prevail in the area of the Paria Peninsula favor the presence of important bird species and subspecies new to science that live only inside the park, such as the colorful earwig hummingbird. Among the mammals are the white-faced capuchin monkey and the spiny rat, as well as deer, foxes, spider monkeys and báquiros.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

In the Eastern Cordillera bioregion, where almost the entire state is included Sucre, except for the muddy plain, 125 species of mammals have been recorded, equivalent to 38.2% of the national total (20). The largest number of species is found in the evergreen and cloud forests. So far no endemics have been found, and many species are common also in other nearby and distant bioregions, as is the case with the bat black mastiff (Molossus sinaloe) - also distributed in the Central Cordillera -, the two-fingered guava sloth (Choloepus didactylus), the dwarf anteater (Cyclopes didactylus), the common water mouse (Neusticomys venezuelae), the bat The Greater white bat (Diclidurus ingens) and the White-winged sucker bat (Thyroptera tricolor), species located in the deltaic and southern Orinoco bioregions.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

Among the mammals reported in the bioregion, not including the Araya Peninsula find the common cachicamo (Dasypus novencinctus), the cuchicuchi (Potos flavus), the red deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Including the Araya Peninsula,
The common fox (Cerdocyon thous), the savannah rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), the common porcupine (Coendu prehensilis), the common picure (Dasyprocta leporina), the common squirrel (Sciurus granatensis) and the cardon bat (Leptonycteris curasoae).{{cn|date=December 2022}}
 
[[File:Caballos 2010.jpg|thumb|Horses in Casanay, Sucre State]]
Most mammals are bats, which have an important role in the pollination of numerous plants and in the dispersal of seeds.
The swampy plain of the Ajíes-Río San Juan stream covers a small area of the bioregion of the deltaic system, where fewer mammals have been recorded, only 96, equivalent to 29.3% of the national total. However, there is an endemic and exclusive species, the Picure deltano (Dasyprocta guamara), with a wide distribution
in the Neotropics.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

In this area there are three semi-aquatic species: the water opossum (Chironectes minimus), the neotropical otter (Lontra longicaudis), and the giant otter (Pteronura). This is an area of global importance for the distribution of the manatee (Trichechus manatus), since significant populations of this species have been found in the world.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

===Climate===
[[File:The Isla Caracas, Sucre, Mochima National Park Venezuela....JPG|thumb|Caracas Islands, Mochima National Park, Sucre State]]
In the western coastal area, a semi-arid climate can be observed, with an average annual temperature of 24-26&nbsp;°C in Cumaná and rainfall of 375&nbsp;mm. The Araya Peninsula is a representative area of strong climate in terms of drought and aridity conditions. In the southern parallel strip, a rainy tropical savanna climate is observed, which extends to the area of the coastal slope to the Caribbean Sea. In Carúpano, average temperatures of 26-35&nbsp;°C and changing rainfall of 524–1,046&nbsp;mm are observed. In the Gulf of Paria the average annual rainfall increases from 1,200 to more than 2,000&nbsp;mm with a forested climate. In the area of the interior mountain range there is a section where the tropical climate prevails at high altitudes.
