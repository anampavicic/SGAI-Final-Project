'''Thanjavur''' ({{IPA-ta|t̪aɲdʑaːʋuːɾ|lang}}), also known as '''Thanjai''', previously known as '''Tanjore''',<ref name="britannicap195">[[#Pletcher|Pletcher]] 2010, p. 195</ref> is a city in the [[India|Indian]] state of [[Tamil Nadu]]. It is the 12th biggest city in Tamil Nadu. Thanjavur is an important center of [[South Indian culture|southern Indian]] religion, art, and architecture. Most of the [[Great Living Chola Temples]], which are [[World Heritage Sites|UNESCO World Heritage Monuments]], are located in and around Thanjavur. The foremost among these, the [[Brihadeeswara Temple]], built by the Chola emperor [[Rajaraja I]], is located in the centre of the city. This temple has one of the largest bull statues (called Nandi<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mystery of Big temple bull / Nandi, Thanjavur, TN!! |url=http://www.navrangindia.in/2018/06/mystery-of-big-temple-bull-nandi_14.html |access-date=2023-12-14}}</ref>) in India carved out of a single granite rock. Thanjavur is also home to [[Tanjore painting]], a painting style unique to the region. Thanjavur is the headquarters of the [[Thanjavur District]]. The city is an important agricultural centre located in the [[Cauvery Delta|Kaveri Delta]] and is known as the ''Rice bowl of Tamil Nadu''. Thanjavur is administered by a [[Thanjavur Municipal Corporation|municipal corporation]] covering an area of {{convert|36.31|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} and had a population of 222,943.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.tnurbantree.tn.gov.in/thanjavur | title=Thanjavur Corporation | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240521041758/https://www.tnurbantree.tn.gov.in/thanjavur/ | archive-date=2024-05-21}}</ref> Roadways are the major means of transportation, while the city also has rail connectivity. The nearest airport is [[Tiruchirapalli International Airport]], located {{convert|59.6| km|mi|abbr=on}} away from the city. The nearest seaport is [[Karaikal port|Karaikal]], which is {{convert|94|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from Thanjavur.
The city first rose to prominence during the reign of the [[Cholas]] when it served as the capital of the empire. After the fall of the Cholas, the city was ruled by various dynasties such as the [[Mutharaiyar dynasty]], the [[Pandyas]], the [[Vijayanagar Empire]], the [[Madurai Nayaks]], the [[Thanjavur Nayaks]], the [[Thanjavur Marathas]] and the [[British Empire]]. It has been a part of independent India since 1947.

== Etymology ==
The city's name is believed to be derived from a [[Blend word|portmanteau]] of "thanjam puguntha oor" ({{langx|ta|தஞ்சம் புகுந்த ஊர்}}) which means "the town where refugees entered", referring to the town's history of providing hospitality to newcomers.

According to another local legend, the name "Thanjavur" originated from "Tanjan," an [[Asura]] (demon) who was slain on the site. In [[Hindu mythology]], Tanjan requested the establishment of a beautiful city at the place where he was defeated. Later, the Asura was vanquished in what is now Thanjavur by the Hindu god [[Neelamegha Perumal temple|Neelamegha Perumal]], an incarnation of [[Vishnu]].<ref name="southern India">{{cite book |author1=Playne Wright Somerset Staff |title=Southern India: Its History, People, Commerce and Industrial Resources |author2=Somerset Playne |author3=J.

The city's name "Thanjavur" might also be derived from the name of a [[Mutharaiyar dynasty|Mutharayar]] king, "Thananjay" or "Dhananjaya". Thananjaya added to Oor gives the name Thanjavur. The Kalamalla stone inscription (the first stone inscription) was made by the king, Erikal Muthuraju Dhanunjaya Varma of 575 CE.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

This place was previously called [[Sirkazhi|Śiyāli]].

There are no references to Thanjavur in the [[Sangam period]] (third century BCE to fourth century CE) [[Tamil language|Tamil]] records, though some scholars believe that the city has existed since that time. [[Kovilvenni|Kovil Venni]], situated {{convert|15|mi|km}} to the east of the city, was the site of the [[Battle of Venni]] between the Chola king [[Karikala]] and a confederacy of the [[Chera Dynasty|Cheras]] and the [[Pandyas]].<ref name="sastrip32">[[#Sastri|Sastri]] 1935, p. 32</ref> The Cholas seemed to have faced an invasion of the [[Kalabhras]] in the third century CE after which the kingdom faded into obscurity.

When the Chola Empire began to decline in the 13th century, the Pandyas from the south invaded and captured Thanjavur twice, first between 1218–19 and again in 1230. During the second invasion, the Chola king [[Rajaraja Chola III|Rajaraja III]] (1216–56) was exiled and he sought the help of the [[Hoysala]] king [[Vira Narasimha II]] (1220–35) to regain Thanjavur.<ref name="sastrip4222">[[#Sastri|Sastri]] 1935, p. 422</ref> Thanjavur was eventually annexed along with the rest of the Chola kingdom by the Pandya king [[Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I]] (1268–1308) in 1279 and the Chola kings were forced to accept the suzerainty of the Pandyas.<ref name="sastrip429">[[#Sastri|Sastri]] 1935, p. 429</ref> The Pandyas ruled Thanjavur from 1279 to 1311 when their kingdom was raided by the forces of [[Malik Kafur]] (1296–1306) and later annexed by the [[Delhi Sultanate]].<ref name="Aiyangar">{{cite book|title=South India and her Muhammadan invaders|year=1921|first=S.

Thanjavur was successfully conquered in 1674 by [[Ekoji I]] (1675–84), the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] feudatory of the [[Adil Shahi dynasty|sultan of Bijapur]] and half-brother of [[Shivaji]] (1627/30-80) of the [[Bhonsle]] dynasty.

The Maratha rulers patronized [[Carnatic music]]. In 1787, Amar Singh, the regent of Thanjavur, deposed the minor Raja, his nephew [[Serfoji II]] (1787–93) and captured the throne. Serfoji II was restored in 1799 with the assistance of the [[British Raj|British]], who induced him to relinquish the administration of the kingdom and left him in charge of Thanjavur fort and surrounding areas. The kingdom was eventually absorbed into British India in 1855 by the [[Doctrine of Lapse]] when [[Shivaji II]] (1832–55), the last Thanjavur Maratha ruler, died without a legitimate male heir.
