'''Chŏngju''' ({{IPA|ko|tsʌŋ.dzu}}; also '''Jŏngju''') is a [[Administrative divisions of North Korea|''si'']], or city, in southern [[North Pyongan Province|North P'yŏngan]] province, [[North Korea]].  Prior to 1994, it was designated as a ''kun'' or county. The terrain is mostly level, but mountainous in the north. To the south lies the Chongju Plain, where the hills do not rise above {{convert|200|m|ft}}. Chŏngju also includes approximately 10 islands in the [[Yellow Sea]].
==History==
Artifacts from the neolithic period and the Bronze age were found in the Taesan-ri area (this was formerly a region of Seoksandong and Taesandong under the administrative division of Teokeon-myeon), showing evidence of human existence at the time in the area. When it was under the control of Goguryeo, it was under the subdivision of Mannyeon County, and it was under control of the Pyongyang Amnok subdivision during the Balhae period. After the fall of balhae and before Goryeo reacquired the area, the region was occupied by the jurchens. During the Goryeo period, it was known as ''guju'', meaning "turtle province". In 1231, King Gojong of Goryeo promoted the region into ''jeongwondaehobu'', and the region later became Jeongjumok. Jeongjumok was divided into Sucheon county and Kusong county, but it was soon again remerged as Jeongjumok. The region was demoted as Jeongwon prefecture in 1812. In 1895, it became Jeongju County which was under control of Uijubu.<ref name="cyb">{{cite web|url=http://www.cybernk.net/infoText/InfoAdminstList.aspx?mc=AD0101&ac=A0303|title=정주시개요|website=cybernk.net}}</ref><ref name="encykor">{{cite web|url=https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Article/E0050904|title=정주군|website=[[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]]}}</ref>

==Economy==
Local agriculture is dominated by orcharding and rice farming; the chestnuts of this region are especially famous.

In February 2011, the city and others in North P'yŏngan had rare protests, of a few score of people, calling for adequate provision of rice and power.
