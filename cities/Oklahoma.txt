=== 19th century ===

During the 19th century, the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] forcibly removed tens of thousands of American Indians from their ancestral homelands from across North America and transported them to the area including and surrounding present-day Oklahoma. The Choctaw was the first of the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] to be removed from the [[Southeastern United States]]. The phrase "[[Trail of Tears]]" originated from a description of the removal of the [[Choctaw]] Nation in 1831, although the term is usually used for the [[Cherokee]] removal.<ref name="len_green">

Increased presence of white settlers in Indian Territory and their demand for land owned and guaranteed to Indian tribes by treaties with the U.S. government prompted the United States to enact the [[Dawes Act]] in 1887 and the [[Curtis Act of 1898]]. The acts abolished tribal governments, eliminated tribal ownership of land, and allotted {{cvt|160|acre|ha}} of land to each head of an Indian family. An objective of the acts was the forced assimilation of Indians into white society. Land not allotted to individual Indians was owned by the U.S. government and sold or distributed to settlers and railroads. The proceeds of the land sales were used to educate Indian children and advance the policy of assimilation. As a result of the two acts about one-half of land previously owned by Indian tribes was owned by whites by 1900.<ref>{{cite web | first=Robert|last=Hamilton|url=http://itech.fgcu.edu/&/issues/vol3/issue1/united.htm|title= United States and Native American Relations | publisher=Florida Gulf Coast University| access-date=August 1, 2007}}</ref> Moreover, much of the land allotted to individual Indian heads of families became white-owned.

The acquisition of tribal lands by the U.S. government led to [[land runs]], also called "land rushes," from 1887 and 1895. Major land runs, including the [[Land Rush of 1889]], opened up millions of acres of formerly tribal lands to white settlement. The "rushes" began at a precise times as each prospective settler literally raced with other prospective settlers to claim ownership of {{cvt|160|acre|ha}} of land under the [[Homestead Act of 1862]].

In late September 1918, the first cases of the [[Spanish flu]]  appeared in Oklahoma. Though public health authorities statewide had some indication that the pandemic was westward, the turmoil caused by the rapid advancement of the disease quickly overwhelmed both health workers and local governing bodies. In Oklahoma City, shortages of both supplies and personnel were mitigated, in part, by the mobilization of the American Red Cross. Rough estimates based on contemporary reports indicate that approximately 100,000 people fell ill with the disease before the pandemic ebbed in 1919. Of those 100,000 cases, it is assumed that around 7,500 proved fatal, placing total mortality rates for the state in the area of 7.5%.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Spanish Influenza Pandemic in Oklahoma City |url=https://www.metrolibrary.org/archives/essay/2019/07/spanish-influenza-pandemic-oklahoma-city |access-date=2023-05-04 |website=Metropolitan Library System |language=en}}</ref>

During the 1930s, parts of the state began to suffer from the consequences of poor farming practices.

[[File:Oklahoma Köppen.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|Köppen climate types of Oklahoma]]

Oklahoma is the 20th-largest state in the United States, covering an area of {{Convert|69895|sqmi}}, with {{Convert|68591|sqmi}} of land and {{Convert|1304|sqmi}} of water.<ref name=2010census>{{cite web | url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf | title=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts, 2010 Census of Population and Housing | publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] | pages=V–2, 1 & 41 (Tables 1 & 18) | date=September 2012 | access-date=October 11, 2018}}</ref> It lies partly in the [[Great Plains]] near the geographical center of the 48 [[Contiguous United States|contiguous states]]. It is bordered on the east by [[Arkansas]] and [[Missouri]], on the north by [[Kansas]], on the northwest by [[Colorado]], on the far west by [[New Mexico]], and on the south and near-west by [[Texas]].

=== Borders ===
Oklahoma's border with Kansas was defined as the 37th Parallel in the 1854 [[Kansas–Nebraska Act|Kansas-Nebraska Act]]. This was disputed with the Cherokee and Osage Nations, which claimed their border extended North of this line and could not be part of the [[Kansas Territory]]. This was resolved in 1870 with the [[Drum Creek Treaty]], which reestablished Kansas's southern border as the 37th parallel. This also applied to the then No-Man's Land that became the [[Oklahoma Panhandle]].

The Oklahoma-Texas border consists of the [[Red River of the South]] in the south and the 100th meridian west as the western border between Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. These were first established in the 1819 [[Adams–Onís Treaty]] between the United States and Spain.

The Oklahoma panhandle was originally part of the Panhandle of the Republic of Texas, but when Texas joined the Union as a slave state, it could not retain any lands north of 36 degrees 30 minutes, as specified in the [[Missouri Compromise]]. The Panhandle existed as a no-man's land until 1907 when Oklahoma acquired the territory upon gaining statehood.

Oklahoma's Eastern border is divided between Missouri and Arkansas. The Missouri-Oklahoma border is defined as the Meridian passing through the Kawsmouth,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hoffhaus |first=Charles E. |title=Chez les Canses: three centuries at Kawsmouth: the French foundations of metropolitan Kansas City |date=1984 |publisher=Lowell Press |isbn=0-913504-91-2 |location=Kansas City |oclc=12314083}}</ref> where the Kansas River meets the Missouri River. This is the same Meridian as the Kansas-Missouri border.

The Oklahoma-Arkansas border was originally defined by two lines: the borders between Arkansas and the Cherokee and Choctaw Reservations. This formed two diagonal lines meeting at the western edge of Fort Smith Arkansas, with one line running northeast from the Red River and the other running southeast from the Oklahoma-Arkansas-Missouri border. The Choctaw-Arkansas border was established in the 1820 [[Treaty of Doak's Stand|Treaty of Doak's Sand]], and later refined in the 1830 [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]]. These treaties left a 57-acre [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] of the Choctaw reservation bounded by Arkansas, the Arkansas River and the Poteau River. This became the site of a smuggling camp called "Coke Hill", noted mostly for its importance in cocaine smuggling.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Curry |first=Bill |date=1978-12-07 |title=Arkansas, Oklahoma Fighting Border War Over 57 Acres |language=en-US |newspaper=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1978/12/07/arkansas-oklahoma-fighting-border-war-over-57-acres/af020620-9c70-4305-83f6-dc185fc50b46/ |access-date=2022-11-19 |issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

After Petitioning congress to hand over jurisdiction, the 57 acres was given to Arkansas in 1905. The 1985 US Supreme Court Case Oklahoma v. Arkansas decided the land would remain Arkansas, even though the Choctaw had not been notified or asked about the territory being handed over.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Oklahoma v. Arkansas, 473 U.S. 610 (1985) |url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/473/610/ |access-date=2022-11-19 |website=Justia Law |language=en}}</ref> Therefore, the Poteau River serves as the Oklahoma-Arkansas boundary for approximately 1 mile, reducing the Choctaw Reservation and later Oklahoma by 57 acres as established in the treaties of the early 1800s.

===Climate===

[[File:Lightning over Tulsa cropped.jpg|thumb|Oklahoma's climate is prime for the generation of [[thunderstorm]]s.]]

Oklahoma is in a humid subtropical region<ref name="Climate of OK" /> that lies in a transition zone between semiarid further to the west, humid continental to the north, and humid subtropical to the east and southeast. Most of the state lies in an area known as [[Tornado Alley]] characterized by frequent interaction between cold, dry air from Canada, warm to hot, dry air from Mexico and the Southwestern U.S., and warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. The interactions between these three contrasting air currents produces [[severe weather]] (severe thunderstorms, damaging thunderstorm winds, large hail and tornadoes) with a frequency virtually unseen anywhere else on planet Earth.<ref name="The Climate of Oklahoma"/> An average 62 [[tornado]]es strike the state per year—one of the highest rates in the world.<ref name="Annual average number of tornadoes">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/climate-information/extreme-events/us-tornado-climatology |title=Tornado Climatology |publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center |access-date=October 24, 2006}}</ref>

Because of Oklahoma's position between zones of differing prevailing temperature and winds, weather patterns within the state can vary widely over relatively short distances, and they can change drastically in a short time.<ref name="The Climate of Oklahoma" /> On November 11, 1911, the temperature at Oklahoma City reached {{cvt|83|F}} (the record high for that date), then [[Great Blue Norther of November 11, 1911|a cold front of unprecedented intensity]] slammed across the state, causing the temperature to reach {{cvt|17|F}} (the record low for that date) by midnight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mesonet.org/index.php/news/article/november_11_1911_a_palindrome_to_remember |title=News &#124; November 11, 1911: A Palindrome to Remember |publisher=Mesonet |access-date=February 6, 2013}}</ref> This type of phenomenon is also responsible for many of the tornadoes in the area, such as the [[Tornado outbreak of April 27–29, 1912|1912 Oklahoma tornado outbreak]] when a warm front traveled along a stalled cold front, resulting in an average of about one tornado per hour.<ref name="1912 tornadoes" />

The [[humid subtropical climate]] (Köppen ''Cfa'') of central, southern, and eastern Oklahoma is influenced heavily by southerly winds bringing moisture from the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Traveling westward, the climate transitions progressively toward a [[semiarid]] zone (Köppen ''BSk'') in the high plains of the Panhandle and other western areas from about [[Lawton, Oklahoma|Lawton]] westward, less frequently touched by southern moisture.<ref name="Climate of OK"/> Precipitation and temperatures decline from east to west accordingly, with areas in the southeast averaging an annual temperature of {{cvt|62|F}} and an annual rainfall of generally over {{cvt|40|in|-1}} and up to {{cvt|56|in|-1}}, while areas of the (higher-elevation) panhandle average {{cvt|58|F}}, with annual rainfall under {{cvt|17|in|-1}}.<ref>[http://www.owrb.ok.gov/ Oklahoma Water Resources Board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723021315/http://www.owrb.ok.gov/ |date=July 23, 2009}}</ref>

Over almost all of Oklahoma, winter is the driest season. Average monthly precipitation increases dramatically in the spring to a peak in May, the wettest month over most of the state, with its frequent and not uncommonly severe thunderstorm activity. Early June can still be wet, but most years see a marked decrease in rainfall during June and early July. Mid-summer (July and August) represents a secondary dry season over much of Oklahoma, with long stretches of hot weather with only sporadic thunderstorm activity not uncommon many years. Severe drought is common in the hottest summers, such as those of 1934, 1954, 1980 and 2011, all of which featured weeks on end of virtual rainlessness and highs well over {{cvt|100|F}}. Average precipitation rises again from September to mid-October, representing a secondary wetter season, then declines from late October through December.<ref name="The Climate of Oklahoma" />

The entire state frequently experiences temperatures above {{cvt|100|F}} or below {{cvt|0|F}},<ref name="Climate of OK">{{cite web |url=http://climate.mesonet.org/county_climate/Products/oklahoma_climate_overview.pdf |title=Oklahoma's Climate: an Overview |publisher=University of Oklahoma |access-date=August 1, 2007}}</ref> though below-zero temperatures are rare in south-central and southeastern Oklahoma. Snowfall ranges from an average of less than {{cvt|4|in|0}} in the south to just over {{cvt|20|in|0}} on the border of [[Colorado]] in the panhandle.<ref name="The Climate of Oklahoma" /> The state is home to the [[Storm Prediction Center]], the [[National Severe Storms Laboratory]], the [[Warning Decision Training Division]], and the [[Radar Operations Center]], all part of the [[National Weather Service]] and in [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/misc/about.html |title=SPC and its Products |last=Novy |first=Chris |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |access-date=August 1, 2007}}</ref>

===State government===

{{See also|Governor of Oklahoma||Oklahoma Legislature|Oklahoma Supreme Court}}

The [[Oklahoma Legislature|Legislature of Oklahoma]] consists of the [[Oklahoma Senate|Senate]] and the [[Oklahoma House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. As the lawmaking branch of the state government, it is responsible for raising and distributing the money necessary to run the government. The Senate has 48 members serving four-year terms, while the House has 101 members with two-year terms. The state has a [[term limit]] for its legislature that restricts any one person to twelve cumulative years service between both legislative branches.<ref name="Oklahoma Government 2" /><ref>{{cite web|publisher=U.S. Term Limits |access-date=August 9, 2007 |url=http://www.ustl.org/leglong.html |title=Legislative Longevity Limits |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070920054851/http://www.ustl.org/leglong.html |archive-date=September 20, 2007 }}</ref>

Oklahoma's judicial branch consists of the [[Oklahoma Supreme Court]], the [[Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals]], and 77 District Courts that each serve one county. The Oklahoma judiciary also contains two independent courts: a Court of [[Impeachment in the United States|Impeachment]] (for [[impeachment trial]]s) and the [[Oklahoma Court on the Judiciary]]. Oklahoma has two courts of last resort: the state Supreme Court hears civil cases, and the state Court of Criminal Appeals hears criminal cases (this split system exists only in Oklahoma and neighboring Texas). Judges of those two courts, as well as the Court of Civil Appeals are appointed by the governor upon the recommendation of the state Judicial Nominating Commission, and are subject to a [[non-partisan]] retention vote on a six-year rotating schedule.<ref name="Oklahoma Government 2">{{cite web | date=June 7, 2007 | publisher=Netstate| access-date=August 1, 2007 | url=http://www.netstate.com/states/government/ok_government.htm| title=Oklahoma State Government}}</ref>

The executive branch consists of the [[Governor of Oklahoma|governor]], their staff, and other elected officials. The principal head of government, the governor is the chief executive of the Oklahoma executive branch, serving as the [[List of Latin phrases (E)|ex officio]] [[Commander-in-chief]] of the [[Oklahoma National Guard]] when not called into [[Federal government of the United States|Federal]] use and reserving the power to veto bills passed through the legislature. The responsibilities of the Executive branch include submitting the budget, ensuring state laws are enforced, and ensuring peace within the state is preserved.<ref>{{cite web| date=December 1, 1995| publisher=Governor's Commission| access-date=August 6, 2007| url=http://www.oklaosf.state.ok.us/osfdocs/gvcmmsh2.html| title=Report of the Governor's Commission on Government Performance| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429100905/http://www.oklaosf.state.ok.us/osfdocs/gvcmmsh2.html| archive-date=April 29, 2007| url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Local government===
{{See also|List of counties in Oklahoma}}
The state is divided into 77 [[County (United States)|counties]] that govern locally, each headed by a three-member council of elected commissioners, a tax assessor, clerk, [[court clerk]], treasurer, and [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]].<ref>{{cite web |date=January 6, 2006 |publisher=Government of Oklahoma |access-date=August 1, 2007 |url=http://www.state.ok.us/osfdocs/county.html |title=List of County Officers |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531193042/http://www.state.ok.us/osfdocs/county.html |archive-date=May 31, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> While each municipality operates as a separate and independent local government with executive, legislative and judicial power, county governments maintain jurisdiction over both incorporated cities and non-incorporated areas within their boundaries, and have executive power but no legislative or judicial power.

Thirty-nine Native American tribal governments are based in Oklahoma, each holding limited powers within designated areas. While [[Indian reservation]]s are typical in most of the United States, they are not present in Oklahoma, tribal governments hold land granted during the Indian Territory era, but with limited jurisdiction and no control over state governing bodies such as municipalities and counties. Tribal governments are recognized by the United States as quasi-sovereign entities with executive, judicial, and legislative powers over tribal members and functions, but are subject to the authority of the [[United States Congress]] to revoke or withhold certain powers. The tribal governments are required to submit a constitution and any subsequent amendments to the United States Congress for approval.<ref>{{cite news |first=Robert|last=Henry| url=http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=61934| date=March 22, 1989|title= Oklahoma Attorney General's Opinions: Question Submitted by: The Honorable Enoch Kelly Haney, Oklahoma State Senate| publisher=The Oklahoma State Courts Network | access-date=August 21, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Lindsay|last=Robertson|url=http://thorpe.ou.edu/guide/robertson.html|year=2001|title=Native Americans and the Law: Native Americans Under Current United States Law|publisher=[[University of Oklahoma]]|access-date=August 21, 2007|archive-date=April 16, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416012037/http://thorpe.ou.edu/guide/robertson.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Oklahoma has 11 substate districts including the two large Councils of Governments, INCOG in Tulsa (Indian Nations Council of Governments) and ACOG (Association of Central Oklahoma Governments).

{{Main|Politics of Oklahoma}}

During the first half-century of statehood, Oklahoma was considered a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] stronghold, being carried by the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in only two presidential elections ([[1920 United States presidential election|1920]] and [[1928 United States presidential election|1928]]). After the [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 election]], the state turned firmly Republican. Although registered Republicans were a minority in the state until 2015,<ref name="voters">{{cite web | url=http://www.ok.gov/elections/documents/VRStatsbycountyjan152015.pdf | title=Registration by Party as of January 15, 2015 | publisher=Oklahoma State Election Board | access-date=February 6, 2015 | archive-date=February 7, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207050926/http://www.ok.gov/elections/documents/VRStatsbycountyjan152015.pdf }}</ref> Oklahoma has been carried by Republican presidential candidates in all but one election since 1952: [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 landslide victory]]. Every single county in the state has been won by the Republican candidate in each election since [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]]. In fact, it was the only state where [[Barack Obama]] failed to carry any counties in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]]. Oklahoma City was the largest city in the United States carried by Republican Donald Trump in both the 2016 and 2020 elections.

Democrats are strongest in urban areas, such as the inner parts of Oklahoma City and Tulsa, as well as the [[college town]]s of Norman and Stillwater, and areas which are most heavily [[African American]]. The party once held dominance in the eastern part of the state and [[Little Dixie (Oklahoma)|Little Dixie]] before the area gradually shifted Republican in the late 2000s. As of the 2020 election, Native American voters, 16% of the state's population, are split, with urban populations supporting the Democrats and rural reservation populaces favoring the Republicans.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2020-11-03|title=Oklahoma Voter Surveys: How Different Groups Voted|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/ap-polls-oklahoma.html|access-date=2020-11-16|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Following the [[United States Census Bureau|2000 census]], the Oklahoma delegation to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] was reduced from six to five representatives, each serving one [[congressional district]]. Oklahoma has had an all-Republican congressional delegation since 2021 and previously from 2013 to 2019.
