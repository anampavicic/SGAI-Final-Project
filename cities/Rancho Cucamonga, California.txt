==History==
[[File:Maria Merced Tapia.jpg|thumb|left|María Merced Tapia inherited [[Rancho Cucamonga]] from her father, [[Tiburcio Tapia]], a wealthy [[Californio]] merchant. She sold it to John Rains in 1858.]]
By 1200&nbsp;AD, Kukamongan [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] had established a village settlement in the area around present-day Red Hill, near the city's western border, where Red Hill Country Club stands today. Kukamonga derives its name from a [[Tongva language|Tongva]] word meaning "sandy place."<ref name=":3">{{cite web|title = Rancho Cucamonga {{!}} California, United States|url = http://www.britannica.com/place/Rancho-Cucamonga#ref842429|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date = January 15, 2016}}</ref> Anthropologists have determined that this cluster of settlers likely belonged to the [[Tongva people]] or Kich people, at one time one of the largest concentrations of Native American peoples on the North American continent.<ref name=":4">{{cite web|title = Rancho Cucamonga - History of RC|url = https://www.cityofrc.us/cityhall/planning/hpp/history.asp |publisher= Rancho Cucamonga |website= cityofrc.us |access-date = January 15, 2016|archive-date = October 6, 2018|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181006154833/https://www.cityofrc.us/cityhall/planning/hpp/history.asp|url-status = dead}}</ref> In the 18th century, following an expedition led by [[Gaspar de Portolá|Gaspar de Portola]], the land was incorporated into the [[Spanish missions in California|Mission System]]  established by [[Junipero Serra|Father Junipero Serra]] and his group of soldiers and [[Franciscan monk|Franciscan friars]]. 
[[File:John Rains House 2.JPG|thumb|left|190px|[[Casa de Rancho Cucamonga]], a National Historic Landmark, built in 1861]]
After a half century of political jockeying in the region, the land finally came under the control of [[Juan Bautista Alvarado]], governor of Mexico. On March 3, 1839, Alvarado granted {{Convert|13,000|acre|ha}} of land in the area called "[[Rancho Cucamonga|Cucamonga]]" to Tubercio Tapia, a first-generation Spanish native of [[Los Angeles]], successful merchant, and notorious smuggler.<ref name=":4" /><ref>{{cite web|title = RANCHO CUCAMONGA: An old tale of smuggler's gold|url = http://www.pe.com/articles/tapia-689241-gold-rancho.html|website = Press Enterprise|access-date = January 16, 2016|date = May 6, 2014}}</ref> Tapia went on to establish the [[Cucamonga Winery|first winery]] in California on his newly deeded land.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" /><ref>{{cite web|title = Thomas Vineyards – California's Oldest Winery|url = https://ginoffvine.wordpress.com/2010/05/08/thomas-vineyards-californias-oldest-winery/|website = Ginoffvine|access-date = January 16, 2016|date = May 7, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = San Bernardino|url = http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=21476|website = ohp.parks.ca.gov|access-date = January 16, 2016}}</ref> [[Rancho Cucamonga]] was purchased by John Rains and his wife in 1858.

During the ensuing years the town prospered and grew. In 1887, irrigation tunnels were dug into Cucamonga Canyon by [[History of Chinese Americans|Chinese laborers]] and the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe Railroad]] was extended through the area. Among the town's economic mainstays was agriculture, including olives, peaches, citrus, and, most notably, vineyards.<ref name=":3" /> In 1913, the [[Pacific Electric|Pacific Electric Railway]] was extended through Rancho Cucamonga in an effort to improve crop transportation. Several landmarks in existence today pay tribute to the city's multicultural founding. In particular, Our Lady of Mt. Carmel<ref>{{cite web|title = Parish History - Our Lady of Mount Carmel|url = http://www.olmtcarmelranchocucamonga.org/home/our-parish|website = Olmtcarmelranchocucamonga.org|access-date = January 16, 2016}}</ref> remains as a relic of the area's Mexican agriculture laborers while the Chinatown House<ref>{{Cite news|title = Chinatown House in Rancho Cucamonga|url = http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-china-house-rancho-cucamonga-video-premiumvideo.html|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|access-date = January 16, 2016|issn = 0458-3035|language = en-US}}</ref> stands as a reminder of the Chinese immigrants who labored in constructing the area's infrastructure.<ref name=":4" />

In 1977, the [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] communities of [[Alta Loma, Rancho Cucamonga, California|Alta Loma]], Cucamonga, and [[Etiwanda, Rancho Cucamonga, California|Etiwanda]] voted to incorporate, forming the city of Rancho Cucamonga.<ref>{{cite news|title=Getting the masses in the mood|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/nov/25/business/fi-shop25/2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001451/http://articles.latimes.com/2006/nov/25/business/fi-shop25/2|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 3, 2013|author=Roger Vincent and Adrian G.

===Grapeland===
The former community of Grapeland, first settled in 1869, lay roughly between today's Victoria Groves Park and Central Park. There was a schoolhouse which also doubled as a church. In 1890 an irrigation district was formed and $200,000 in bonds were sold to pay for improvements. The Sierra Vista reservoir was built in 1886-87 by J.L. Scofield as the focal point of a network of irrigation pipes.  The system was unused, however, because the bond issue was declared illegal. "Orchards and vineyards began to die," ''[[The Daily Report]]'' newspaper reported in a retrospective. "Residents moved out. The post office closed in 1905. Homes, buildings were destroyed or abandoned." The reservoir remained unused until 1956, when the Fontana Union Water Company filled it with {{Convert|5|e6USgal|e6L|abbr=unit}} of water. The local school district was merged with the [[Etiwanda School District|Etiwanda district]] in 1901. In 1957 the settlement was practically deserted, but there were still rabbit-proof stone walls marking boundaries of previous citrus orchards.<ref>"Rubble Remains of a Community That Was — Grapeland," ''The Daily Report,'' July 13, 1957, page 3 / FONTANA–

<blockquote>Between Fontana and Etiwanda lie the dry, dusty remains of a community that died for lack of water. The name of the town was Grapeland. A few people still live in the original tpwnsite, but the brilliant future that was predicted for it in the 1880s never came to pass. Unpaved dirt roads, still graded by San Bernardino County, run spasmodically through the area. Grapevines still cover much of the parched land; but gone are the citrus groves, the fruit trees, the early pioneer settlers.... The first settlers came to Grapeland in 1869. Later, more and more arrived, until in 1890 the need for adequate water became imperative. An irrigation district was formed and $200,000 in bonds were sold. With this money, the Sierra Vista Reservoir was built as the focal point of a network of irrigation pipes. It was to remain unused for 66 years, for the entire bond issue was declared illegal. Orchards and vineyards began to die. Residents moved out. The post office was closed in 1905. Homes, buildings were destroyed or abandoned. Today, the hot sun parches the empty fields of Grapeland—the community that died of thirst. / Still in fairly good shape along Grapeland's ghost roads are rabbit-proof stone walls around long-gone ciitrus orchards. / CONSTRUCTED 1886–1887, J.L. Scofield, Engineer and Builder is the legend proclaimed by this plaque in the Sierra Vista Reservoir, which proved a delusion to settlers. It remained dry until 1956, when the Fontana Union Water Co. plastered its colorful pebbly exterior and filled it with 5,000,000 gallons of water.</blockquote></ref>

==Economy==
[[File:HavenPark, Rancho Cucamonga.JPG|thumb|An example of the office parks along Haven Avenue]]

While most of the city's land area is devoted to residential areas, Rancho Cucamonga, like its neighbors [[Ontario, California|Ontario]] and [[Fontana, California|Fontana]], is a major center for the [[logistics]] industry in Southern California. This is due to its proximity to two [[interstate highways]] and [[Ontario International Airport]], and the space afforded by the large tracts of former agricultural land in the southern section of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citivu.com/rc/city/tlanes.html |title=Region Occupies Pivotal Position on Commercial Lanes |publisher=Citivu.com |access-date=December 11, 2011}}</ref>

In the area around Milliken Avenue, between Archibald and Etiwanda Avenues, Foothill Boulevard, and Fourth Street, about seven square miles of land are primarily occupied by numerous massive distribution centers, and even more, smaller manufacturing companies. This area is ringed by office parks, mostly along Haven Avenue, and shopping strips, such as the Terra Vista Town Center (part of a nearly two-square-mile master-planned community in the center of the city), and malls, such as [[Victoria Gardens (Rancho Cucamonga)|Victoria Gardens]], and the [[Ontario Mills]], across Fourth Street in [[Ontario, California|Ontario]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofrc.us/govt/documents/Exhibit3-1LANDUSE.pdf |title=Land use |publisher= City of Rancho Cucamonga| website=cityofrc.us |date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007113055/http://www.cityofrc.us/govt/documents/Exhibit3-1LANDUSE.pdf |access-date=January 31, 2021|archive-date=October 7, 2011 }}</ref>

The city is also home to a [[Commercial Metals Company|CMC Steel]] (formerly Gerdau, formerly TAMCO Steel) [[minimill]], the only producer of [[Steel#Long steel|long steel]] in California.

[[File:Victoria Gardens Cultural Center and Library.JPG|thumb|The Victoria Gardens Cultural Center]]
[[File:Central Park, Rancho Cucamonga, California.jpg|thumb|Central Park]]
[[Victoria Gardens (Rancho Cucamonga)|Victoria Gardens]] is a [[Lifestyle center (retail)|lifestyle center]] near the eastern end of the city, at the intersection of Foothill and Day Creek Boulevards. Since the city had never developed a traditional commercial [[downtown]] like neighboring cities Ontario and [[Upland, California|Upland]] had, efforts were made in the design of Victoria Gardens to bring elements of more traditional and urban town design to what had historically been a suburban city. While retaining many characteristics of traditional [[shopping mall]]s, such as large anchor stores, a food court, and vast parking lots and garages, the smaller stores are arranged as city blocks in a grid of two-lane streets, featuring lush landscaping and metered "teaser parking" in front of the stores, which open onto the sidewalk. There are two "[[Main Street]]s", which run from west to east across the center. Running from north to south between them is a pedestrian axis leading from one of the [[Macy's]] anchor stores, through a "town square" between a pair of mixed-use office buildings, to the [[Victoria Gardens Cultural Center]], which contains the Lewis Playhouse (a 570-seat [[producing house|theater]]) and a branch of the city library. The east side of the development has Southern California's first [[Bass Pro Shops]] Outdoor World superstore; the {{Convert|180000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility includes a Tracker Boat Center and the Islamorada Fish Company restaurant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stores.basspro.com |title= All Bass Pro Shops Locations| website= basspro.com| access-date=November 28, 2018}}</ref> There are restaurants throughout the center, both well-known chains and unique eateries. The center also features a 12-screen movie theater.

==Government==
===Local government===
Rancho Cucamonga is a General Law City, incorporated in 1977 under the "Council-Manager" form of local government. The four-member Council, plus the Mayor, City Clerk, and City Treasurer, are all elected at-large by the voters of the city. The Council then appoints the City Manager, who acts as the administrative head of the city government and is responsible for the day-to-day operations, code enforcement, and the fiscal soundness of the municipal government. The council itself serves as a local legislative body.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} 
The city's elections, which are plurality, are held on a Tuesday after the first Monday in November of even-numbered years.

According to a city Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the city's various funds had $278.3 million in revenues, $243.6 million in expenditures, $1,400.7 million in total assets, $492.1 million in total liabilities, and $583.3 million in cash and investments.<ref name="cafr">{{cite web|title=City of Rancho Cucamonga - Comprehensive Annual Financial Report|url=http://www.cityofrc.us/cityhall/admin/finance/budgeting.asp|publisher=Rancho Cucamonga|website=cityofrc.us|year=2009|access-date=December 11, 2011|archive-date=April 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416042351/http://www.cityofrc.us/cityhall/admin/finance/budgeting.asp|url-status=dead}}</ref>

At {{cvt|640|MW}} net capacity, it was Reliant's second-highest-capacity plant on the West Coast. It utilized four steam turbine generators; of which units three and four remained active after turbines one and two, as well as a combustion turbine, were retired in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Several systems are in place to control gas emissions, and annually, over {{cvt|900000000|USgal|impgal GL}} of recycled water are used for cooling.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.reliant.com/en_US/Page/Generic/Public/Wholesale_Plant_Listings.jsp |archive-url= https://archive.today/20080112193257/http://www.reliant.com/en_US/Page/Generic/Public/Wholesale_Plant_Listings.jsp |archive-date=January 12, 2008 |title=Reliant Energy - Electric Power Generation within the United States |access-date=May 17, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> As of 2024, all turbines and stacks and the entire electrical plant have been removed.
