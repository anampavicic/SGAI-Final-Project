'''Wolfsburg''' ({{IPA|de|ˈvɔlfsbʊʁk|lang|De-Wolfsburg.ogg}}; [[Eastphalian language|Eastphalian]]: ''Wulfsborg'') is the fifth largest city in the [[Germany|German]] state of [[Lower Saxony]], located on the river [[Aller (Germany)|Aller]]. It lies about {{convert|75|km|0|abbr=on}} east of [[Hanover]] and {{convert|230|km|0|abbr=on}} west of [[Berlin]].

Wolfsburg is famous as the location of [[Volkswagen AG]]'s headquarters and [[Wolfsburg Volkswagen Plant|the world's biggest car plant]]. The [[Autostadt]] is a visitor attraction next to the Volkswagen factory that features the company's model range: [[Audi AG|Audi]], [[Bentley Motors|Bentley]], [[Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S.|Bugatti]], [[Ducati]], [[Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A.|Lamborghini]], [[MAN SE|MAN]], [[Neoplan]], [[Porsche AG|Porsche]], [[Scania AB|Scania]], [[SEAT, S.A.|SEAT]], [[Škoda Auto]] and [[Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles]]. Wolfsburg is one of the few German cities built during the first half of the 20th century as a [[planned community|planned city]]. From its founding on 1 July 1938 as a [[company town|home for workers]] producing the [[Strength Through Joy|KdF]]-[[VW Beetle|Wagen]] until 25 May 1945, the city was called '''Stadt des KdF-Wagens bei Fallersleben'''. In 1972, the population first exceeded 100,000. In 2019, the GRP was €188,453 per capita.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kreise mit höchstem Bruttoinlandsprodukt je Einwohner |url=https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/1186514/umfrage/top-kreise-bruttoinlandsprodukt-je-einwohner/ |access-date=2022-08-22 |website=Statista |language=de}}</ref>

==Geography==

===Climate===
The total annual precipitation is about {{convert|532|mm|0|abbr=on}} which is quite low as it belongs to the lowest tenth of the measured data in Germany.

==History==
The [[Wolfsburg Castle|"Wolfsburg" Castle]] was first mentioned in 1302 in a document as the domicile of the noble lineage of [[Bartensleben]]. Originally a keep next to the Aller, it was protected by a [[moat]] some centuries later. In 1372, the first documentary reference to the ''Burg Neuhaus'' ("castle of Neuhaus") near Wolfsburg appeared. After the extinction of the Bartensleben line in 1742, the property and its ''Schloss Wolfsburg'' (Wolfsburg castle) passed on to the Counts of Schulenburg. The communal manor was an important employer for the nearby settlements ''Rothenfelde'' and ''Heßlingen''.

Some of today's urban districts, including ''Vorsfelde'' and the villages transferred to Wolfsburg from the county of [[Helmstedt]], belonged to the [[Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]]. ''Fallersleben'' and other villages belonged to the Electorate of Braunschweig-Lüneburg, which later developed into the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] and became a [[Prussia]]n province in 1866. Other urban districts, including ''Heßlingen'', belonged to the Prussian [[Duchy of Magdeburg]]. In 1932, these districts were detached from the Prussian [[Province of Saxony]] and integrated into the [[Province of Hanover]].

Wolfsburg was founded on 1 July 1938 as the ''Stadt des KdF-Wagens bei Fallersleben,'' (''"''City of the [[Strength Through Joy]] car at [[Fallersleben]]), a planned town centred around the village of Fallersleben, built to house workers of the [[Volkswagen]] factories erected to assemble what would be later known as the [[Volkswagen Beetle]]. During World War II, military cars, aeroplanes, and other military equipment were built there, mainly by [[forced labour in Germany during World War II|forced workers]] and [[prisoners-of-war]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In 1942, German authorities established the [[Arbeitsdorf concentration camp]] in the city for a few months. At least six individuals died while working at this camp.

The city and Volkswagen factory were captured on April 11, 1945, by US troops, and about 7,700 [[forced labour]]ers were liberated from the Volkswagen factory. The US troops occupied the city until the end of June, during which time the city was renamed '''Wolfsburg''' on 25 May 1945, after the eponymous castle located there. The American occupation ended at the end of June 1945 when the region became part of the [[British Occupation zone in Germany|British occupation zone]]. In 1951, Wolfsburg was separated from the District of Gifhorn, and became an [[list of German urban districts|urban district]].

In 1955, the one-millionth VW Beetle was manufactured in Wolfsburg. Postwar Beetle production ended in Wolfsburg in 1974, though Beetle production continued within Germany at [[Emden]] until 1978. The factories in Wolfsburg remain a key part of Volkswagen's production capacity.

During the [[German economic miracle]] Wolfsburg experienced a large influx of immigrant workers, especially from Italy.

In 1958, the city hall was built. In 1960 the Volkswagenwerk [[GmbH]] (limited partnership with a limited liability) was changed into an [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]] (public limited company).

In the course of a land reform in Lower Saxony in 1972, 20 localities were added to the city through the "Wolfsburg-Act". Wolfsburg gained the status of major city with nearly 131,000 inhabitants. The city's area grew from 35 to nearly {{Convert|204|km2|abbr=on}}. In 1973, the city's population peaked at 131,971.

In 1982, the A39, a side road of the [[Bundesautobahn 2|A2]] (Oberhausen - Hannover - Werder), was built as a direct freeway to Wolfsburg.

In 1988, the city became a university town with the establishment of the University of Applied Science Braunschweig/Wolfenbüttel. Today its name is [[Ostfalia University of Applied Sciences]].

As a launch promotion for the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5|5th generation]] of the [[Volkswagen Golf]] the city of Wolfsburg welcomed visitors on the internet, on the official stationery, and on every city limit sign with the name "'''Golfsburg'''" from 25 August to 10 October 2003. This campaign gained the nationwide attention of press, radio, and TV broadcasting.

In the summer of 2009, Wolfsburg gained nationwide attention when their football team, [[VfL Wolfsburg]], won the German football league. A party was held in the city centre with about 100,000 people, the first in the history of the city.

==Culture and attractions==
[[File:Schloß Wolfsburg 2016-1.jpg|thumb|Wolfsburg Castle]]
[[File:Autostadt, Wolfsburg Gelände.jpg|thumb|The [[Autostadt]]]]
[[File:111223 VW Kraftwerk WOB.jpg|thumb|The illuminated Volkswagen power plant at night]]
The centre of Wolfsburg is unique in Germany. Instead of a medieval city centre, Wolfsburg features a new and modern attraction called the [[Autostadt]]. The old part of the city [[Alt Wolfsburg]] [[:de:Alt-Wolfsburg|(de)]] shows some manor buildings in traditional framework style. Atop a hill by the [[Aller (Germany)|River Aller]] is the [[Wolfsburg Castle]].

The Autostadt is an open-air museum-theme park dedicated to [[automobile]]s owned and operated by Volkswagen. In the center of the park are the pavilions featuring Volkswagen's major brands: Volkswagen and Audi to the north, further south are SEAT, [[Škoda Auto]], Lamborghini, Bentley, [[Bugatti]], and the Premium Clubhouse. Right next to the lagoon is the [[Porsche]] pavilion. The striking Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles pavilion is in the south-east of the park.
The Autostadt also includes a [[planetarium]], a [[Ritz-Carlton]] hotel, the [[Phaeno Science Center]], the largest hands-on science museum in Germany, a water skiing resort, and a private art museum (''[[Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg]]'') specialising in modern and contemporary art.

Another major attraction is the Wolfsburg Water Show, the world's largest water-flame-laser-video fountain show with its up to 70-meter high fountains which was in the Autostadt complex in 2014. The event sometimes can be seen when there are special events in the complex.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.niedersachsen-tourism.com/wassershow-wolfsburg |access-date=29 September 2014|title=Water show Wolfsburg: A truly unique experience is provided by the world's largest mobile water-fountain show with its up to 70 meter high fountains. The show is being staged every night for a period of four weeks. Visitors can prepare themselves for an unforgettable spectacle. Every year, the show is themed and staged differently, and accompanied by a lavish play of colours and a laser show.}}</ref>

Besides the Autostadt, another well-known and distinctive attraction is BadeLand, a beautiful wellness and relaxation centre with a bathing area and various saunas.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Das Badeland Wolfsburg - Baden und Saunieren in Wolfsburg|url=https://www.badeland-wolfsburg.de/|access-date=2022-01-29|website=Badeland Wolfsburg|language=de-DE}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=E|first=Allison|date=2022-01-14|title=Top 8 Places to Visit in Wolfsburg, Germany|url=https://www.whatsdalatest.com/top-places-to-visit-in-wolfsburg/|access-date=2022-01-29|website=Whatsdalatest|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Population==
From about 1,000 inhabitants in 1938, the population of the city increased to 25,000 in 1950 and doubled to 50,000 until 1958. On 1 July 1972, the population of Wolfsburg first went beyond the mark of 100,000 because several adjacent suburbanized villages were incorporated into the city with the "Wolfsburg law" which made Wolfsburg a major city ("Großstadt"). In 1973, the population reached its highest level: 131,971. At the end of December 2010, 121,451 people were registered with their principal residence in Wolfsburg. By the end of 2012, this number had climbed to 123,144.

==Organization==
The city of Wolfsburg is organized into 41 districts. One or more districts make up one of the total of 16 localities which are represented by their own councils. Every council has a local official as its mayor.

First the councils were only established in the 11 localities annexed in 1972. They partly took over the functions of the former city councils of each of the districts. In 1991 and 2001 some of the localities were split into smaller areas so that today there are 16 localities, each with its own council which are directly elected by the citizens.

The only exception from this organization is the [[Allerpark]] (''Aller Park''), a local recreation area surrounding the [[Allersee]] lake, and the area of the Volkswagen factory which are both located in the central city area.

The administrative area of Wolfsburg includes six [[nature reserve]]s. Five of them are located in the ancient Aller river valley.

==Politics==
[[File:Rathaus Wolfsburg.jpg|thumb|The city hall]]
The first mayor of the young Stadt des KdF-Wagens was the government assessor Karl Bock, on enactment #145 of the chief president of the government of [[Lüneburg]] effective from 1 July 1938. His allies were also deployed by the government.

In 1946, the military government of the British zone of occupation established a communal constitution following the British example. After this, citizens voted for a council that elected a volunteer mayor/lord mayor as the city's leader and representative. After 1946, the council elected a full-time director to lead the city council. In 2001, the city council's dual leadership was abolished. It is led by a full-time lord mayor who is also the city's representative. Since 2001, citizens directly elect the lord mayor. The council still has its own chairperson elected by the council's constitutive conference after every local election. The current Bürgermeister (mayor) of Wolfsburg is '''Dennis Weilmann.'''

The city has been described as a "social democratic utopia".<ref name="veconomist" >{{cite news|author=J.C.|title=How to keep populists small and marginal|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/kaffeeklatsch/2017/10/parable-lower-saxony|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|date=15 October 2017}}</ref>

===City council===
The city council is made up of the fractions of the different parties (47 seats) and the lord mayor with one seat. The lord mayor is head of administration, thus the superior of all employees of the city council. The lord mayor is supported by four departmental heads who are voted in by the council on his suggestion. Together, they make up the board of directors of the city administration where the most important decisions concerning administration are deliberated weekly.

===Emblems===
Wolfsburg's emblem shows a silver two-tower castle with a closed gate on red ground over a green base with silver waved timbers. A golden wolf with a blue tongue paces over the castle's battlement. The city's flag is green and white.

Lower Saxony's Department of the Interior awarded the city of Wolfsburg's emblem in 1952 after it had been constituted in the association articles in 1947. In 1961, it was improved heraldically and newly awarded by the governmental executive committee of Lüneburg. The symbols of the wolf and the castle reflect the city's name (canting arm) and do not have a historical, directly conveyed reference. The flag was adopted in 1955.

Volkswagen used a modified version of the Wolfsburg coat of arms as its steering wheel emblem, (and occasionally as a hood ornament, on classic Beetles) until the early 1980s, when it was replaced by the VW roundel.

===Regional authorities===
The city of Wolfsburg is a member of the association ''Braunschweigische Landschaft e.V'', with a registered office in Braunschweig and in the ''Lüneburgischen Landschaftsverband e.V'', with a registered office in [[Uelzen]]. These associations were founded to foster cultural establishments in the regions.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
