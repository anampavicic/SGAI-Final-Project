'''Barisal Division''' ({{Langx|bn|বরিশাল বিভাগ}}, ''Borishal Bibhag'') is one of the eight administrative [[divisions of Bangladesh]]. Located in the south-central part of the country, it has an area of {{convert|13,225|km2|abbr=on}}, and a population of 9,325,820 at the 2022 Census. It is the least populous Division in Bangladesh. It is bounded by [[Dhaka Division]] on the north, the [[Bay of Bengal]] on the south, [[Chittagong Division]] on the east and [[Khulna Division]] on the west. The administrative capital, [[Barisal]] city, lies in the [[Padma River]] delta on an offshoot of the [[Kirtankhola|Arial Khan River]]. Barisal division is criss-crossed by numerous rivers that earned it the nickname ''Dhan-Nodi-Khal, Ei tin-e Borishal'' (rice, river and canal built Barisal).

== History ==

===Ancient period===
Barisal region was the part of [[Vanga Kingdom|Vanga]] and [[Gangaridai]] empire in ancient times. After the fall of [[Gupta dynasty|Gupta]] rule in Bengal, the region became a part of [[Gauda Kingdom]] in the 6th century. Later the region came under the rule of [[Khadga dynasty|Khadgas]], [[Pala Empire|Palas]] and [[Chandra dynasty|Chandras]] in the early mediaeval period. According the epigraphical records of [[Sena Dynasty|Sena]] period, Barisal was the part "Anuttara Vanga" (southern Bengal) division of ancient [[Bengal]]. After the reign of [[Sena Dynasty]], Barisal was ruled by [[Deva dynasty|Deva]] kings in the 12th-13th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Vanga|access-date=12 May 2024|title=Vanga |website=Banglapedia}}</ref><ref name="Sen1999">{{cite book|author=Sailendra Nath Sen|title=Ancient Indian History And Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wk4_ICH_g1EC&pg=PA277|access-date=12 May 2024|date=1 January 1999|publisher=New Age International|isbn=978-81-224-1198-0|page=277}}</ref>

=== Early Middle Ages ===

In early times the Barisal region was composed of an amalgamation of marshlands formed by the merging of islands brought into existence and built up by alluvial soils washed down the great channels of the combined [[Brahmaputra]]-[[Ganges]]-[[Meghna]] river systems.

In the early 13th century, [[Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji]] led the Muslim conquest of Barisal, and soon later [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] completely conquered [[east Bengal|eastern Bengal]]. The [[Hindu]] chieftains from northwest Bengal were dislodged from power and they dispersed over Barisal region and founded the kingdom of Bakla.<ref name=":0" />

During the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] intervention in Bengal, Hindu society was concentrated to northern and western Barisal (known as [[Backergunje|Bakarganj]]). Barisal's southern portion was still covered by forests and laced with lagoons. The northwest was also the only part of Bakarganj where the Hindu population exceeded [[Muslims]] in early British censuses.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier, 1204–1760 |url=https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft067n99v9&chunk.id=d0e10872&toc.id=ch08&toc.depth=1&brand=ucpress&anchor.id=bn08.82#X |access-date=2024-03-03 |website=publishing.cdlib.org}}</ref>

===Mughal period===

Barisal saw a second wave of immigration in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. This time, it was Muslim pioneers who assumed the leading role. Establishing [[Dhaka]] as the provincial Mughal capital of the region, in the early 17th century the Barisal region (known as Sarkar Bakla to Mughals) was more accessible to businessmen and developers than at any previous time. However, piracy in this region along the coasts and rivers of southeastern Bengal by [[Arakanese people|Arakanese]] and renegade [[Portugal|Portuguese]] seamen inhibited any sustained attempts by Mughal governors to push into the Barisal forests.

After 1666, when Mughal naval forces cleared the [[Meghna]] [[estuary]] of such external threats, the Barisal interior lay ripe for colonization. Land developers acquired grants of plots of land, [[taluq]] (তালুক), from provincial authorities. Abundant and easily obtainable by purchase from the late 17th century, these grants tended to be regarded by their possessors [[taluqdar]] (তালুকদার).  As taluqdars brought their taluqs into [[agricultural]] production, these men passed up the [[Land (economics)|land]] [[revenue]] through a class of non-cultivating intermediaries, or zamindar (জমিদার).  Zamindars typically resided in the provincial capital, where they had ready access to the chief provincial revenue officer, or dewan (দেওয়ান).

In a second pattern of land development, [[Muslim]] [[Pir (Sufism)|pirs]] or [[Qadi|Qazi]] went directly into uncultivated regions, organized the local population for clearing the jungles, and only later, after having established themselves as local men of influence, entered into relations with the Mughal authorities. Relationships between the religious Muslim [[Pir (Sufism)|pirs]] and Mughal authorities was not always harmonious, since a pir's natural ties of authority and patronage generally lay with the masses of peasants beneath him and not with the governors and bureaucrats. For example, in remote [[Jhalakati]] Thana in the eastern [[Backergunje|Bakarganj]] many of 18th-century pirs and Educationist, Islamic scholars came under the authority, among them named Saiyid Faqir and Faizus Ahmed Khan (A Persian business man and educationist, came for the business trade through Khyber pass and spread education among the Indian sub continent) from  wielded enormous influence with the cultivators of the all-Muslim village of Saiyidpur, Hizla and Muladi named after the pirs. But a difficulty arose, noted a 1906 village survey of Pir Fakir of Saiyidpur village, because "the people of this part looked upon the Fakir as their guide and did not pay rent to the [[Nawab]]." In this situation, one Lala Chet Singh, a captain in the employ of the governor, "succeeded in persuading the Fakir to leave the country."

=== British rule ===

In 1797 the area was established as [[Bakerganj District]] but later renamed as Barisal District and Pir of Hizla-Muladi, Faizus Ahmed Khan stayed back and settled in Muladi-Hizla village.

=== Pakistani rule ===

In 1948 part of [[Bakerganj District]] area was renamed [[Barisal District|Barisal]] and other was [[Patuakhali District]] as one of five districts of [[Khulna Division]].

=== Bangladesh ===

The Greater Barisal region (Barisal District along with five other neighbouring districts) was created as Barisal Division on 1 January 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.escholarship.org/editions/view?docId=ft067n99v9&chunk.id=s1.8.3&toc.depth=1&toc.id=ch08&brand=eschol |title=The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier, 1204–1760 |publisher=Escholarship.org |access-date=2013-02-15}}</ref>

== Economy ==
Barisal is known as the "Granary of Bengal" for its rice production. It is still an important rice-producing area of the country. Since the Middle Ages, Barisal has acted as a trans-shipment center for hides, rice, dried beans, dried peas, lentils, chickpeas, and other [[legume]]s for Bengal. Bakery, textile, and pharmaceutical products are the output of a few industrial installations.  There are [[Sher-e Bangla Medical College]] (affiliated with the National University) and [[Brojomohun College|B. M. College]] (an educational institution of Barisal Division established in 1889). Barisal is also a river port once connecting Calcutta-Barisal-Dhaka and many other routes. Today Barisal River port is the most important hub of steamer and motor launch service of Southern Bangladesh.
