'''Gdynia''' ({{IPA|pl|ˈɡdɨɲa|lang|Pl-Gdynia.ogg}}; {{langx|csb|Gdiniô}}; {{langx|de|Gdingen}} {{IPA|de|ˈɡdɪŋən||audio=De-Gdingen.ogg}}, {{langx|de|label=1939-45|Gotenhafen}} {{IPA|de|ˈɡoːtn̩haːfn̩||Gdingen - Gotenhafen.ogg}}) is a city in northern [[Poland]] and a [[seaport]] on the [[Baltic Sea]] coast. With an estimated population of 257 000, it is the [[List of cities in Poland|12th-largest city]] in Poland and the second-largest in the [[Pomeranian Voivodeship]] after [[Gdańsk]].<ref name="population" /> Gdynia is part of a [[conurbation]] with the spa town of [[Sopot]], the city of Gdańsk, and [[suburb]]an communities, which together form a [[metropolitan area]] called the [[Tricity, Poland|Tricity]] (''Trójmiasto'') with around one million inhabitants.

Historically and culturally part of [[Kashubia]] and [[Pomerelia|Eastern Pomerania]], Gdynia for centuries remained a small fishing village. By the 20th-century it attracted visitors as a seaside [[resort town]]. In 1926, Gdynia was granted city rights after which it enjoyed demographic and urban development, with a [[Modernist architecture|modernist]] cityscape. It became a major seaport city of Poland. In 1970, [[1970 Polish protests|protests]] in and around Gdynia contributed to the rise of the [[Solidarność|Solidarity movement]] in nearby [[Gdańsk]].

The [[port of Gdynia]] is a regular stopover on the cruising itinerary of luxury passenger ships and [[Ferry|ferries]] travelling to [[Scandinavia]]. [[Modernist Center of Gdynia|Gdynia's downtown]], designated a [[List of Historic Monuments (Poland)|historical monument of Poland]] in 2015, is an example of building an integrated European community and includes [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalist]] architectural forms.

== History ==
===Early history===
[[File:Saint Michael Archangel church in Gdynia (7).jpg|left|thumb|Medieval St. Michael Archangel Church is the oldest building in Gdynia]]
The area of the later city of Gdynia shared its history with [[Pomerelia]] (Eastern Pomerania). In prehistoric times, it was the center of [[Oksywie culture]]; it was later populated by [[Slavs]] with some [[Baltic Prussian]] influences. In the late 10th century, the region was united with the emerging state of Poland<ref>André Vauchez, Richard Barrie Dobson, Adrian Walford, Michael Lapidge, ''Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages'', Routledge, 2000, p.: 1163, {{ISBN|978-1-57958-282-1}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=om4olQhrE84C&dq=Gdansk+medieval+Pomerania&pg=PA1164 link]</ref> by its first historic ruler [[Mieszko I]]. During the reign of [[Bolesław II the Bold|Bolesław II]], the region seceded from Poland and became independent, to be reunited with Poland in 1116/1121 by [[Bolesław III Wrymouth|Bolesław III]].<ref>James Minahan, One Europe, Many Nations: A Historical Dictionary of European National Groups, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2000, p.375, {{ISBN|978-0-313-30984-7}}</ref> In 1209, the present-day district of [[Oksywie]] was first mentioned (''Oxhöft''). Following the fragmentation of Poland, the region became part of the Duchy of Pomerania (Eastern), which became separate from Poland in 1227, to be reunited in 1282. The first known mention of the name "Gdynia", as a [[Pomeranians (Slavic tribe)|Pomeranian]] ([[Kashubians|Kashubian]]) fishing village dates back to 1253. The first church on this part of the Baltic Sea coast was built there. In 1309–1310, the [[Teutonic Order]] invaded and annexed the region from Poland. In 1380, the owner of the village which became Gdynia, Peter from [[Rusocin, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Rusocin]], gave the village to the [[Cistercian]] Order. In 1382, Gdynia became property of the Cistercian [[Oliwa Abbey|abbey]] in [[Oliwa]]. In 1454, King [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] signed the act of reincorporation of the region to the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]], and the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454–66)|Thirteen Years' War]], the longest of all Polish-Teutonic wars, started. It ended in 1466, when the Teutonic Knights recognized the region as part of Poland. Administratively, Gdynia was located in the [[Pomeranian Voivodeship (1466–1772)|Pomeranian Voivodeship]] in the province of [[Royal Prussia]]<ref>Daniel Stone,''A History of East Central Europe'', University of Washington Press, 2001, p. 30, {{ISBN|978-0-295-98093-5}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=LFgB_l4SdHAC&dq=%22Royal+prussia%22+Poland+1466+Elbl%C4%85g&pg=PA30 Google Books] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230414150351/https://books.google.com/books?id=LFgB_l4SdHAC&dq=%22Royal+prussia%22+Poland+1466+Elbl%C4%85g&pg=PA30 |date=14 April 2023 }}</ref> in the [[Greater Poland Province, Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Greater Poland Province]] of the Kingdom of Poland and later of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The present-day neighbourhood of Kolibki was the location of the Kolibki estate, purchased by King [[John III Sobieski]] in 1685.

In 1772, Gdynia was annexed by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in the [[First Partition of Poland]]. Gdynia, under the Germanized name ''Gdingen'', was included within the newly formed province of [[West Prussia]] and was expropriated from the Cistercian Order. In 1789, there were only 21 houses in Gdynia. Around that time Gdynia was so small that it was not marked on many maps of the period: it was about halfway from Oksywie and Mały Kack, now districts of Gdynia. In 1871, the village became part of the [[German Empire]]. In the early 20th century Gdynia was not a poor fishing village as it is sometimes described; it had become a popular tourist spot with several guest houses, restaurants, cafés, several brick houses and a small harbour with a pier for small trading ships. The first [[Kashubians|Kashubian]] mayor was Jan Radtke.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Map of Danzig and around in 1899, showing Gdingen |url=http://schwertfamily.net/maps/map_west_und_ostpreussen_1899.jpg |access-date=15 July 2018 |archive-date=26 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210126122724/https://schwertfamily.net/maps/map_west_und_ostpreussen_1899.jpg |url-status=live }}</ref> It is estimated that around 1910 the population of Gdynia was 895 people.<ref>[https://rcin.org.pl/Content/47399/PDF/WA51_50580_r1956-z5_Dokumentacja-Geogr.pdf A.

Following [[World War I]], in 1918, Poland regained independence, and following the [[Treaty of Versailles]], in 1920, Gdynia was re-integrated with the reborn Polish state. Simultaneously, the nearby city of Gdańsk (''Danzig'') and surrounding area was declared a [[Free City of Danzig|free city]] and put under the [[League of Nations]], though Poland was given economic liberties and requisitioned for matters of foreign representation.

=== Construction of the seaport ===
[[File:Gdynia, Dworzec Morski 1935 (67264189).jpg |left|thumb|Gdynia Seaport in 1935]]
The decision to build a major seaport at Gdynia village was made by the Polish government in winter 1920,<ref name="World Port Source - Gdynia">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/POL_Port_of_Gdynia_1177.php |title=Port of Gdynia |work=worldportsource.com |access-date=29 May 2010 |archive-date=29 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129053809/http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/POL_Port_of_Gdynia_1177.php |url-status=dead }}</ref> in the midst of the [[Polish–Soviet War]] (1919–1920).<ref name="Citino">[[Robert M.

[[File:140429-POL-Gdynia-Muzeum MW.jpg|thumb|Museum of the Navy in Gdynia|left]]

Construction of Gdynia seaport started in 1921<ref name="Citino"/> but, because of financial difficulties, it was conducted slowly and with interruptions. It was accelerated after the [[Sejm]] (Polish parliament) passed the ''Gdynia Seaport Construction Act'' on 23 September 1922. By 1923 a 550-metre pier, {{convert|175|m|abbr=off}} of a wooden tide breaker, and a small harbour had been constructed. Ceremonial inauguration of Gdynia as a temporary military port and fishers' shelter took place on 23 April 1923. The first major seagoing ship, the French Line steamer ''Kentucky'', arrived on 13 August 1923 after being diverted because of a strike at Gdansk.<ref>"Emigration Shipping Lines of Gdynia, 1924-1939", by Oskar Myszor, in ''East Central Europe in Exile: Transatlantic Migrations'', ed. by Anna Mazurkiewicz (Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2014) p. 165</ref>

To speed up the construction works, the Polish government in November 1924 signed a contract with the French-Polish Consortium for Gdynia Seaport Construction. By the end of 1925, they had built a small seven-metre-deep harbour, the south pier, part of the north pier, a railway, and had ordered the trans-shipment equipment. The works were going more slowly than expected, however. They accelerated only after May 1926, because of an increase in Polish exports by sea, economic prosperity, the outbreak of the German–Polish trade war which reverted most Polish international trade to sea routes, and thanks to the personal engagement of [[Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski]], Polish Minister of Industry and Trade (also responsible for the construction of [[Centralny Okręg Przemysłowy]]). By the end of 1930 docks, piers, breakwaters, and many auxiliary and industrial installations were constructed (such as depots, trans-shipment equipment, and a rice processing factory) or started (such as a large cold store).{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

Trans-shipments rose from 10,000 tons (1924) to 2,923,000 tons (1929). At this time Gdynia was the only transit and special seaport designed for coal exports.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

In the years 1931–1939 Gdynia harbour was further extended to become a universal seaport. In 1938 Gdynia was the largest and most modern seaport on the Baltic Sea, as well as the tenth biggest in Europe. The trans-shipments rose to 8.7&nbsp;million tons, which was 46% of Polish foreign trade. In 1938 the [[Stocznia Gdynia|Gdynia shipyard]] started to build its first full-sea ship, the ''[[SS Olza|Olza]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Szabados |first=Stephen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T_zvDwAAQBAJ&dq=1938+Gdynia+shipyard+Olza&pg=PT51 |title=Polish Immigration to America: When, Where, Why and How |date=2016-08-27 |publisher=Stephen Szabados |language=en |access-date=18 May 2022 |archive-date=25 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230425160608/https://books.google.com/books?id=T_zvDwAAQBAJ&dq=1938+Gdynia+shipyard+Olza&pg=PT51 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Construction of the city ===
The city was constructed later than the seaport. In 1925 a special committee was inaugurated to build the city; city expansion plans were designed and [[city rights]] were granted in 1926, and tax privileges were granted for investors in 1927. The city started to grow significantly after 1928.

A [[Gdynia Główna railway station|new railway station]] and the Post Office were completed. The [[Polish State Railways|State railways]] extended their lines, built bridges and also constructed a group of houses for their employees. Within a few years houses were built along some {{convert|10|mi|0|abbr=out}} of road leading northward from the [[Free City of Danzig]] to Gdynia and beyond. Public institutions and private employers helped their staff to build houses.<br/>
In 1933 a plan of development providing for a population of 250,000 was worked out by a special commission appointed by a government committee, in collaboration with the municipal authorities. By 1939 the population had grown to over 120,000.<ref>(ed) Michael Murray, ''Poland's Progress 1919–1939'', John Murray, 1944, London pp 64–6</ref>

Some 50,000 Polish citizens were [[Expulsion of Poles by Nazi Germany|expelled]] to the [[General Government]] (German-occupied central Poland) to make space for new German settlers in accordance with the ''[[Lebensraum]]'' policy. Local [[Kashubians]] who were suspected to support the Polish cause, particularly those with higher education, were also arrested and executed.

The harbour was transformed into a German naval base. The [[shipyard]] was expanded in 1940 and became a branch of the [[Kiel]] shipyard (''Deutsche Werke Kiel A.G.''). The city became an important base, due to its being relatively distant from the [[war theater]], and many German large ships—[[battleship]]s and [[heavy cruiser]]s—were anchored there. During 1942, Dr Joseph Goebbels authorized relocation of {{SS|Cap Arcona|1927|2}} to Gotenhafen Harbour as a stand-in for {{RMS|Titanic}} during filming of the German-produced movie ''[[Titanic (1943 film)|Titanic]]'', directed by [[Herbert Selpin]].

The seaport and the shipyard both witnessed several air raids by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] from 1943 onwards, but suffered little damage. Gdynia was used during winter 1944–45 to evacuate German [[troop]]s and refugees trapped by the [[Red Army]]. Some of the ships were hit by [[torpedo]]es from Soviet [[submarine]]s in the [[Baltic Sea]] on the route west. The ship {{MV|Wilhelm Gustloff||2}} sank, taking about 9,400 people with her – the worst loss of life in a single sinking in maritime history. The seaport area was largely destroyed by withdrawing German troops and millions of encircled [[refugee]]s in 1945 being bombarded by the Soviet military (90% of the buildings and equipment were destroyed) and the harbour entrance was blocked by the German battleship {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} that had been brought to Gotenhafen for major repairs.

=== After World War II ===
[[File:Wybory 1989 2.jpg|thumb|[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] election rally in Gdynia, 1989]]
On 28 March 1945, the city was captured by the Soviets and restored to Poland. The Soviets installed a communist regime, which stayed in power until the [[Fall of Communism]] in the 1989. The post-war period saw an influx of settlers from [[Warsaw]] which was [[Destruction of Warsaw|destroyed by Germany]], and other parts of the country as well as [[Polish people|Poles]] from the cities of Wilno (now [[Vilnius]]) and Lwów (now [[Lviv]]) from the [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|Soviet-annexed former eastern Poland]]. Also [[Greeks]], [[refugees of the Greek Civil War]], settled in the city.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kubasiewicz |first=Izabela |editor-last1=Dworaczek |editor-first1=Kamil |editor-last2=Kamiński |editor-first2=Łukasz |year=2013 |title=Letnia Szkoła Historii Najnowszej 2012.

On 17 December 1970, worker demonstrations took place at Gdynia Shipyard. Workers were fired upon by the police. [[Janek Wiśniewski]] was one of 40 killed, and was commemorated in a song by [[Mieczysław Cholewa]], ''Pieśń o Janku z Gdyni''. One of Gdynia's important streets is named after Janek Wiśniewski. The event was also portrayed in [[Andrzej Wajda]]'s movie ''[[Man of Iron]]''.

On 4 December 1999, [[Cyclone Anatol|a storm]] destroyed a huge crane in a shipyard.{{Citation needed|date=July 2024}}

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
The climate of Gdynia is an [[oceanic climate]] owing to its position of the [[Baltic Sea]], which moderates the temperatures, compared to the interior of [[Poland]]. The climate is mild and there is a somewhat uniform precipitation throughout the year. Autumns are significantly warmer than springs because of the warming influence of the Baltic Sea. Nights on average are warmer than in the interior of the country. Typical of [[Northern Europe]], there is little sunshine during late autumn, winter and early spring, but plenty during late spring and summer. Because of its northerly latitude, Gdynia has 17 hours of daylight in midsummer but only around 7 hours in midwinter.
The lowest [[pressure]] in Poland was recorded in Gdynia - 960.2 hPa on January 17, 1931.

Examples of modernist architecture are the buildings of the Bank of Poland and many tenement houses (''[[Kamienica (architecture)|kamienice]]''). Another good example of modernism is ''PLO Building'' situated at 10 Lutego Street.

=== Cultural references ===
In 2008, Gdynia made it onto the ''[[Monopoly (game)#Monopoly Here and Now|Monopoly Here and Now World Edition]]{{Broken anchor|date=2024-09-18|bot=User:Cewbot/log/20201008/configuration|target_link=Monopoly (game)#Monopoly Here and Now|reason= The anchor (Monopoly Here and Now) [[Special:Diff/1186938100|has been deleted]].}}'' board after being voted by fans through the Internet. Gdynia occupies the space traditionally held by [[Mediterranean Avenue]], being the lowest voted city to make it onto the Monopoly Here and Now board, but also the smallest city to make it in the game. All of the other cities are large and widely known ones, the second smallest being Riga. The unexpected success of Gdynia can be attributed to a mobilization of the town's population to vote for it on the Internet.

An abandoned factory district in Gdynia was the scene for the survival series ''Man vs Wild'', season 6, episode 12. The host, [[Bear Grylls]], manages to escape the district after blowing up a door and crawling through miles of sewer.

[[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]], the supervillain in the [[List of James Bond novels and short stories|James Bond novels]], was born in Gdynia on 28 May 1908, according to ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]''.

Gdynia is sometimes called "Polish [[Roswell, New Mexico|Roswell]]" due to the alleged [[UFO]] crash on 21 January 1959.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ufocasebook.com/polandcrashes.html |title=Poland UFO Crashes, UFO Casebook Files |first=B.

=== Transport ===
==== Port of Gdynia ====
{{Main|Port of Gdynia}}

In 2007, 364,202 passengers, 17,025,000 tons of cargo and {{TEU|614,373}} containers passed through the port. Regular [[Ferry|car ferry]] service operates between Gdynia and Karlskrona, Sweden.

==== Public transport ====
{{Main|Trolleybuses in Gdynia}}

Gdynia operates one of only three [[trolleybus]] systems in Poland, alongside [[Lublin]] and [[Tychy]]. Today there are 18 trolleybus lines in Gdynia with a total length of 96&nbsp;km. The fleet is modern and consists of [[Solaris Trollino]] cars. There is also a historic line, connecting city centre with a district of [[Orłowo, Gdynia|Orłowo]] operated by five retro trolleybuses. In addition to that, Gdynia operates an extensive network of bus lines, connecting the city with the adjacent suburbs.

==== Airport ====
The conurbation's main airport, [[Gdańsk Lech Wałęsa Airport]], lays approximately {{convert|25|km|mi}} south-west of central Gdynia, and has connections to approximately 55 destinations. It is the third largest airport in Poland.<ref>{{cite web |title=Historia lotniska |url=http://www.airport.gdansk.pl/airport/airport_history |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918212635/http://www.airport.gdansk.pl/airport/airport_history |archive-date=2013-09-18 |access-date=2013-03-12 |website=Airport.Gdansk.pl |publisher=[[Gdańsk Lech Wałęsa Airport]]}}</ref> A second [[General Aviation]] terminal was scheduled to be opened by May 2012, which will increase the airport's capacity to 5mln passengers per year.

Another local airport, ([[Gdynia-Kosakowo Airport]]) is situated partly in the village of [[Kosakowo, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Kosakowo]], just to the north of the city, and partly in Gdynia. This has been a military airport since the World War II, but it has been decided in 2006 that the airport will be used to serve civilians.<ref>{{cite web |title=About airport |url=http://airport.gdynia.pl/en |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521143543/http://airport.gdynia.pl/en |archive-date=21 May 2013 |access-date=2013-03-12 |work=Airport.Gdynia.pl |publisher=Port Lotniczy Gdynia-Kosakowo}}</ref> Work was well in progress and was due to be ready for 2012 when the project collapsed following a February 2014 EU decision regarding Gdynia city funding as constituting unfair competition to Gdańsk airport. In March 2014, the airport management company filed for bankruptcy, this being formally announced in May that year. The fate of some PLN 100&nbsp;million of public funds from Gdynia remain unaccounted for with documents not being released, despite repeated requests for such from residents to the city president, [[Wojciech Szczurek]].

==== Road transport ====
[[Trasa Kwiatkowskiego]] links [[Port of Gdynia]] and the city with [[Obwodnica Trójmiejska]], and therefore [[A1 autostrada (Poland)|A1 motorway]]. [[National road 6 (Poland)|National road 6]] connects [[Tricity, Poland|Tricity]] with [[Słupsk]], [[Koszalin]] and [[Szczecin agglomeration]].

==== Railways ====
[[File:Dworzec Gdynia Główna (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Gdynia Główna railway station|Gdynia Główna]], the city's main railway station]]
The principal station in Gdynia is [[Gdynia Główna railway station]], the busiest railway station in the Tricity and northern Poland and sixth busiest in Poland overall, serving 13,41 mln passengers in 2022.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wymiana pasażerska na stacjach |url=https://dane.utk.gov.pl/sts/przewozy-pasazerskie/wymiana-pasazerska-na-s/18886,Przewozy-pasazerskie.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221008142701/https://dane.utk.gov.pl/sts/przewozy-pasazerskie/wymiana-pasazerska-na-s/18886,Przewozy-pasazerskie.html |archive-date=8 October 2022 |access-date=25 February 2023 |website=Portal statystyczny UTK |language=pl}}</ref> Gdynia has eleven railway stations. Local train services are provided by the 'Fast Urban Railway,' [[Szybka Kolej Miejska (Tricity)]] operating frequent trains covering the [[Tricity, Poland|Tricity]] area including [[Gdańsk]], [[Sopot]] and Gdynia. Long-distance trains from Warsaw via Gdańsk terminate at Gdynia, and there are direct trains to [[Szczecin]], [[Poznań]], [[Katowice]], [[Lublin]] and other major cities. In 2011-2015 the Warsaw-Gdańsk-Gdynia route was undergoing a major upgrading costing $3&nbsp;billion, partly funded by the [[European Investment Bank]], including track replacement, realignment of curves and relocation of sections of track to allow speeds up to {{convert|200|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, modernization of stations, and installation of the most modern [[European Train Control System|ETCS]] signalling system, which was completed in June 2015. In December 2014 new [[Alstom]] [[Pendolino]] high-speed trains were put into service between Gdynia, Warsaw and [[Kraków]] reducing rail travel times to Gdynia by 2 hours.<ref>{{cite news |date=15 December 2014 |title=Polish Pendolino launches 200 km/h operation |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/passenger/single-view/view/polish-pendolino-launches-200-kmh-operation.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216062725/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/passenger/single-view/view/polish-pendolino-launches-200-kmh-operation.html |archive-date=16 December 2014 |access-date=24 December 2014 |work=[[Railway Gazette International]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=30 July 2013 |title=Pendolino z Trójmiasta do Warszawy |trans-title=Pendolino from Tri-city to Warsaw |url=http://www.trojmiasto.pl/wiadomosci/Pendolino-z-Trojmiasta-do-Warszawy-Wiecej-pytan-niz-odpowiedzi-n71010.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728035932/http://www.trojmiasto.pl/wiadomosci/Pendolino-z-Trojmiasta-do-Warszawy-Wiecej-pytan-niz-odpowiedzi-n71010.html |archive-date=28 July 2014 |access-date=24 December 2014 |work=Trojmiasto.pl |language=pl}}</ref>
