A tale behind its acquiring the name Bezawada is that Goddess Krishnaveni ([[Krishna River|River Krishna]]) requested Arjuna to make a passage for her to merge into the [[Bay of Bengal]].

Bezawada (as Vijayawada was known then) was founded around 626 A.D. by [[Pericchedi|Paricchedi]] Kings. Vijayawada history reveals that Bezawada (Vijayawada) was ruled by King Madhava Varma (one of the kings of [[Vishnukundina dynasty]]).<ref>{{citation

[[Mogalrajapuram]] hills have five rock-cut temples, built during the fourth–ninth centuries. Some of the caves can be attributed to [[Vishnukundina dynasty]]. [[Akkana Madanna Caves]], at the foot of Indrakeeladri Hill, is a monument of national importance.<ref name="ASI">{{cite web|url=http://asihyd.ap.nic.in/krishna_monuments.html|title=Monuments of ASI under Hyderabad Circle}}</ref>

At the foot of Indrakeeladri hills is the temple of Malleswara. The temple has inscriptions dating back to ninth century AD to 16th century AD by various kings. There are ten pillars and a mutilated slab (recognised as monuments by [[Archaeological Survey of India]]) with inscriptions in the Telugu language.
