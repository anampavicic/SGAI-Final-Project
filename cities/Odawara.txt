==History==
The area around present-day Odawara has been settled since prehistoric times, and archaeological evidence indicates that the area had a high population density in the [[Jōmon period]]. From the ''[[Ritsuryō]]'' system of the [[Nara period]], the area became part of Ashigarashimo District of [[Sagami Province]]. It was divided into ''[[shōen]]'' during the [[Heian period]], mostly controlled by the [[Hatano clan]] and its branches. During the [[Genpei War]] between the [[Heike clan]] and [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]], the [[Battle of Ishibashiyama]] was fought near present-day Odawara. During the [[Sengoku period]], Odawara developed as a [[jōkamachi|castle town]] and capital of the domains of the [[later Hōjō clan]], which covered most of the [[Kantō region]]. The Hōjō were defeated by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] in the [[Siege of Odawara (1590)|Battle of Odawara]] in 1590, despite the impregnable reputation of [[Odawara Castle]]. The territory came under the control of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]. Under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], Odawara was the center of [[Odawara Domain]], a [[han system|feudal ''han'']] ruled by a succession of ''[[daimyō]]''. The town prospered as [[Odawara-juku]], a [[shukuba|post station]] on the [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tōkaidō]] highway connecting [[Edo]] with [[Kyoto]].

After the [[Meiji Restoration]], Odawara Domain briefly became 'Odawara Prefecture', which was merged with the short-lived 'Ashigara Prefecture' before joining Kanagawa Prefecture in 1876. During this period, the center of economic and political life in Kanagawa shifted to [[Yokohama]]. Odawara suffered a strong decline in population, which was made more severe when the original route of the [[Tōkaidō Main Line]] bypassed the city in favor of the more northerly route via [[Gotemba, Shizuoka|Gotemba]].

The epicenter of the [[1923 Great Kanto earthquake|Great Kantō earthquake]] in 1923 was deep beneath [[Izu Ōshima]] Island in Sagami Bay. It devastated [[Tokyo]], the port city of Yokohama, surrounding prefectures of [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]], Kanagawa, and [[Shizuoka Prefecture]]s, and caused widespread damage throughout the Kantō region. Ninety percent of the buildings in Odawara collapsed immediately, and fires burned the rubble along with anything else left standing.<ref>Hammer, Joshua. (2006).  [https://books.google.com/books?id=6O8VyhDbUPgC&q=yokohama+burning ''Yokohama Burning: The Deadly 1923 Earthquake and Fire that Helped Forge the Path to World War II'', p. 113.]</ref>

Odawara regained some measure of prosperity with the opening of the [[Tanna Tunnel]] in 1934, which brought the main routing of the [[Tōkaidō Main Line]] through the city. Odawara was raised from the status of town to city on December 20, 1940. On August 15, 1945, Odawara was the last city in Japan to be bombed by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] aircraft during [[World War II]].

On November 1, 2000, Odawara exceeded 200,000 in population, and was proclaimed a [[Special cities of Japan|special city]] with increased autonomy.

==Government==
[[File:Odawara City Hall.JPG|thumb|Odawara City Hall]]
Odawara has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 27 members. Odawara contributes two members to the Kanagawa Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of [[Kanagawa 17th district]] of the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].
