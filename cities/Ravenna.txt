It was the capital city of the [[Western Roman Empire]] during the 5th century until its collapse in 476, after which it served as the capital of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] and then the Byzantine [[Exarchate of Ravenna]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Storia dell'Esarcato d'Italia |url=https://www.homolaicus.com/storia/medioevo/esarcato.htm |access-date=2024-01-05 |website=www.homolaicus.com}}</ref>{{Historical populations|1861|55973|1871|58544|1881|59696|1901|62723|1911|69802|1921|70502|1931|76335|1936|80658|1951|91248|1961|114854|1971|131176|1981|137375|1991|135844|2001|134631|2011|153740|2021|155836|type=|align=right|widths=50px|heights=50px|footnote=Source: [[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]]}}Initially settled by the [[Umbri]] people, Ravenna came under [[Roman Republic]] control in 89 BC. [[Augustus|Octavian]] built the military harbor of [[Classe, ancient port of Ravenna|Classis]] at Ravenna, and the city remained an important seaport on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] until the early [[Middle Ages]]. The city prospered under imperial rule. In 401, Western Roman emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] moved his court from [[Mediolanum]] to Ravenna; it then served as capital of the empire for most of the 5th century.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Ravenna became the capital of [[Odoacer]] until he was defeated by the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogoth]] king [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]]. In 540, [[Belisarius]] conquered Ravenna for the [[Byzantine Empire]], and the city became the capital of Byzantine Italy. After a brief [[Lombards|Lombard]] control, Ravenna came under the authority of the [[Pope|Papacy]] and, save for minor interruptions, remained part of the [[Papal States]] until the mid-19th century when it was incorporated into the newly unified [[Kingdom of Italy]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Ravenna - Treccani |url=https://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/ravenna_(Dizionario-di-Storia)/,%20https://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/ravenna_(Dizionario-di-Storia)/ |access-date=2024-01-05 |website=Treccani |language=it}}</ref>

Although it is an inland city, Ravenna is connected to the [[Adriatic Sea]] by the [[Candiano Canal]]. It is known for its well-preserved late Roman and Byzantine architecture, with eight buildings comprising the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] "Early Christian Monuments of Ravenna".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/788 |title=Early Christian Monuments of Ravenna}}</ref> Because of the high concentration of mosaics, the city has been associated with workshops and schools teaching mosaics, and is often given titles like the "capital of mosaics".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Day Trip to Ravenna: What to See in Italy's Mosaic Capital |url=https://www.italymagazine.com/featured-story/day-trip-ravenna-what-see-italys-mosaic-capital |access-date=2023-05-18 |website=ITALY Magazine |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Franceschini {{!}} |first=Giulia |date=2023-04-24 |title=Ravenna, the capital of Italian mosaic |url=https://italoamericano.org/ravenna-mosaic/ |access-date=2023-05-18 |website=L'Italo-Americano – Italian American bilingual news source |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Fiorentino |first1=Sara |last2=Chinni |first2=Tania |last3=Vandini |first3=Mariangela |date=2020-11-01 |title=Ravenna, its mosaics and the contribution of archaeometry.

==History==
{{For timeline}}
The origin of the name ''Ravenna'' is unclear. Some have speculated that "Ravenna" is related to "Rasenna" (or "Rasna"), the term that the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] used for themselves, but there is no agreement on this point.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Names |first=All Things Baby |date=2019-05-31 |title=Ravenna Name Meaning, Origin, Popularity, and More |url=https://www.allthingsbabynames.com/ravenna-name-meaning/ |access-date=2023-01-11 |website=All Things Baby Names |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>[http://www.turismo.ravenna.it/contenuti/index.php?t=arte_storia&id=1&cat=&lang=2 Tourism in Ravenna – Official site – History]. Turismo.ravenna.it (2010-06-20). Retrieved on 2011-06-20.</ref>

===Ancient era===
The origins of Ravenna are uncertain.<ref>Deborah M. Deliyannis, Ravenna in Late Antiquity (Cambridge University Press, 2010), for this and much of the information that follows</ref> The oldest archaeological evidence found dates the [[Umbri]] presence in Ravenna at least to the 5th century BC, where it was undisturbed until the 3rd century BC, when first contact with Roman civilization began.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mascanzoni|first=Leardo|title=Ravenna: Una storia millenaria|publisher=Giunti Barbera Editore|year=1990|pages=3–50|language=it}}</ref> Its territory was settled also by the [[Senones]], especially the southern countryside of the city (that was not part of the lagoon), the ''Ager Decimanus''. Ravenna consisted of houses built on piles on a series of small islands in a marshy lagoon – a situation similar to [[Venice]] several centuries later. The Romans ignored it during their conquest of the [[Po River]] Delta, but later accepted it into the [[Roman Republic]] as a federated town in 89 [[Common Era|BC]].<ref name=":0" />

In 49 BC, it was where [[Julius Caesar]] gathered his forces before crossing the [[Rubicon]]. Later [[Augustus|Octavian]], after his battle against [[Mark Antony]] in 31 BC, founded the military harbor of [[Classe, ancient port of Ravenna|Classis]].<ref>From the Latin for "fleet".</ref> This harbor, protected at first by its own walls, was an important station of the [[Roman Navy|Roman Imperial Fleet]]. Nowadays the city is landlocked, but Ravenna remained an important [[seaport]] on the [[Adriatic]] until the early [[Middle Ages]]. During the Germanic campaigns, [[Thusnelda]], widow of [[Arminius]], and [[Marbod]], King of the [[Marcomanni]], were confined at Ravenna.<ref name=":0" />
[[File:Ravenna(Peutinger Map).png|thumb|left|The city of Ravenna in the 4th century as shown on the [[Peutinger Map]]]]
Ravenna greatly prospered under Roman rule. Emperor [[Trajan]] built a {{convert|70|km|2|abbr=on}} long [[Aqueduct (Roman)|aqueduct]] at the beginning of the 2nd century. During the [[Marcomannic Wars]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] settlers in Ravenna revolted and managed to seize possession of the city. For this reason, Marcus Aurelius decided not only against bringing more barbarians into Italy, but even banished those who had previously been brought there.<ref>Dio 72.11.4-5; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius''</ref> In AD 401, [[Emperor Honorius]] transferred the capital of the [[Western Roman Empire]] from [[Mediolanum]] (current Milan) to Ravenna; it subsequently served as the capital of the empire for most of the 5th century and the last de facto western emperor [[Romulus Augustulus]] was deposed there in AD 476. At that time it was home to 50,000 people.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/1166147 |title=The Fall and Decline of the Roman Urban Mind |website=Academia |last1=Fischer |first1=Svante |last2=Victor |first2=Helena}}</ref> The transfer was made partly for defensive purposes: Ravenna was surrounded by swamps and marshes, and was perceived to be easily defensible (although in fact the city fell to opposing forces numerous times in its history); it is also likely that the move to Ravenna was due to the city's port and good sea-borne connections to the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. In 409, King [[Alaric I]] of the [[Kingdom of the Visigoths|Visigoths]] simply bypassed Ravenna, and went on to [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack]] [[Rome]] in 410 and to take [[Galla Placidia]], daughter of Emperor [[Theodosius I]], hostage.

After many vicissitudes, Galla Placidia returned to Ravenna with her son, Emperor [[Valentinian III]], due to the support of her nephew [[Theodosius II]]. Ravenna enjoyed a period of peace, during which time the Christian religion was favoured by the imperial court, and the city gained some of its most famous monuments, including the Orthodox Baptistry, the misnamed [[Mausoleum of Galla Placidia]] (she was not actually buried there), and [[San Giovanni Evangelista, Ravenna|San Giovanni Evangelista]].

=== Ostrogothic Kingdom ===
{{see also|Ostrogothic Ravenna}}

The late 5th century saw the dissolution of Roman authority in the west, and [[Romulus Augustulus]] was deposed in 476 by the general [[Odoacer]]. Odoacer ruled as King of Italy for 13 years, but in 489 the Eastern Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] sent the [[Ostrogoth]] King [[Theodoric the Great]] to re-take the Italian peninsula. After losing the [[Battle of Verona (489)|Battle of Verona]], [[Odoacer]] retreated to Ravenna, where he withstood a siege of three years by Theodoric, until the taking of [[Rimini]] deprived Ravenna of supplies. Theodoric took Ravenna in 493, supposedly slew Odoacer with his own hands, and Ravenna became the capital of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] of Italy. Theodoric, following his imperial predecessors, also built many splendid buildings in and around Ravenna, including his palace church [[Sant'Apollinare Nuovo]], an Arian cathedral (now Santo Spirito) and Baptistery, and his own [[Mausoleum of Theodoric|Mausoleum]] just outside the walls.

[[File:Mausoleum of Theoderic.JPG|left|thumb|The [[Mausoleum of Theodoric]]]]

Both Odoacer and Theodoric and their followers were [[Arianism|Arian]] Christians, but co-existed peacefully with the Latins, who were largely Catholic Orthodox. Ravenna's Orthodox bishops carried out notable building projects, of which the sole surviving one is the [[Archbishop's Chapel, Ravenna|Cappella Arcivescovile]]. Theodoric allowed Roman citizens within his kingdom to be subject to Roman law and the Roman judicial system. The Goths, meanwhile, lived under their own laws and customs. In 519, when a mob had burned down the synagogues of Ravenna, Theodoric ordered the town to rebuild them at its own expense.

Theodoric died in 526 and was succeeded by his young grandson [[Athalaric]] under the authority of his daughter [[Amalasunta]], but by 535 both were dead and Theodoric's line was represented only by Amalasuntha's daughter [[Matasuntha]]. Various Ostrogothic military leaders took the Kingdom of Italy, but none were as successful as Theodoric had been. Meanwhile, the [[Orthodoxy|orthodox Christian]] [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Justinian I]] opposed both Ostrogoth rule and the [[Arianism|Arian]] variety of Christianity. In 535 his general [[Belisarius]] [[Gothic War (535–554)|invaded Italy]] and in 540 conquered Ravenna. After the conquest of Italy was completed in 554, Ravenna became the seat of Byzantine government in Italy.

From 540 to 600, Ravenna's bishops embarked upon a notable building program of churches in Ravenna and in and around the port city of Classe. Surviving monuments include the [[Basilica of San Vitale]] and the [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe]], as well as the partially surviving San Michele in Africisco.

===Exarchate of Ravenna===

{{Main|Exarchate of Ravenna}}
Following the conquests of [[Belisarius]] for Eastern Roman Emperor [[Justinian I]] in the 6th century, Ravenna became the seat of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] governor of Italy, the [[Exarch]], and was known as the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]. It was at this time that the [[Ravenna Cosmography]] was written.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Storia di Ravenna. Dalla preistoria all'anno Duemila |url=https://www.ilpontevecchio.com/vicus/89-storia-di-ravenna-dalla-preistoria-all-anno-duemila-9788865415955.html |access-date=2024-01-05 |website=ilpontevecchio |language=it-it}}</ref>

Under Byzantine rule, the archbishop of the [[Archbishopric of Ravenna|Archdiocese of Ravenna]] was temporarily granted [[autocephaly]] from the Roman Church by the emperor, in 666, but this was soon revoked. Nevertheless, the archbishop of Ravenna held the second place in Italy after the pope, and played an important role in many theological controversies during this period.

===Middle Ages and Renaissance===
The [[Lombards]], under [[King Liutprand]], occupied Ravenna in 712, but were forced to return it to the Byzantines.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Noble |first1=Thomas F. X. |title=The Republic of St. Peter: The Birth of the Papal State, 680–825. |url=https://archive.org/details/republicofstpete0000nobl |url-access=registration |date=1984 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press. |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |isbn=0-8122-1239-8}}</ref> In 751, the Lombard king, [[Aistulf]], conquered Ravenna, thus ending Byzantine rule in northern Italy.

King [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]] of the [[King of the Franks|Franks]] attacked the Lombards under orders of [[Pope Stephen II]]. Ravenna then gradually came under the direct authority of the [[Pope]]s, although this was contested by the archbishops at various times. [[Pope Adrian I]] authorized [[Charlemagne]] to take away anything from Ravenna that he liked, and an unknown quantity of Roman columns, [[mosaic]]s, statues, and other portable items were taken north to enrich his capital of [[Aachen]].

In 1198 Ravenna led a league of [[Romagna]] cities against the Emperor, and the Pope was able to subdue it. After the war of 1218 the [[Traversari]] family was able to impose its rule in the city, which lasted until 1240. After a short period under an Imperial vicar, Ravenna was returned to the [[Papal States]] in 1248 and again to the Traversari until, in 1275, the [[Da Polenta]] established their long-lasting seigniory. One of the most illustrious residents of Ravenna at this time was the exiled Florentine poet [[Dante]]. The last of the Da Polenta, [[Ostasio III da Polenta|Ostasio III]], was ousted by the [[Republic of Venice]] in February 1441, and the city was annexed to the Venetian territories in the [[Treaty of Cremona (1441)|Treaty of Cremona]].

Ravenna was ruled by Venice until 1509, when the area was invaded in the course of the [[Italian Wars]]. In 1512, during the [[War of the League of Cambrai|Holy League]] wars, Ravenna was sacked by the French following the [[Battle of Ravenna (1512)|Battle of Ravenna]]. Ravenna was also known during the Renaissance as the birthplace of the [[Monster of Ravenna]].

After the Venetian withdrawal, Ravenna was again ruled by legates of the Pope as part of the Papal States. The city was damaged in a tremendous flood in May 1636. Over the next 300 years, a network of [[canals]] diverted nearby rivers and drained nearby swamps, thus reducing the possibility of flooding and creating a large belt of agricultural land around the city.
[[File:Ravenna quattrino.jpg|thumb|An 18th-century [[quattrino]] from Ravenna depicting [[Apollinaris of Ravenna|Saint Apollinaris]]]]

===Modern age===

Apart from another short occupation by Venice (1527–1529), Ravenna was part of the Papal States until 1796, when it was annexed to the French puppet state of the [[Cisalpine Republic]] ([[Italian Republic (Napoleonic)|Italian Republic]] from 1802, and [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] from 1805). It was returned to the Papal States in 1814. Occupied by Piedmontese troops in 1859, Ravenna and the surrounding [[Romagna]] area became part of the new unified [[unification of Italy|Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861.

During [[World War II]], the town suffered severe damage. Fifty-two Allied bombing raids during the course of the Second World War had taken their toll, destroying some of Ravenna's noteworthy, unequalled early Christian art. Bombs intended for the railway station and its sidings had pulverised the [[San Giovanni Evangelista, Ravenna|Basilica of San Giovanni Evangelista]] in August 1944.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://the-past.com/feature/the-riches-of-ravenna/|title=The riches of Ravenna|date=10 December 2020}}</ref> On 5 November 1944 troops of 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards, 5th Canadian Armoured Division and the British [[27th Lancers]] entered and liberated Ravenna. A total of 937 Commonwealth soldiers who died in the winter of 1944–45 are buried in Ravenna War Cemetery, including 438 Canadians.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/history/second-world-war/canada-Italy-1943-to-1945|title=Canada - Italy 1943-1945 - the Second World War - History - Remembrance - Veterans Affairs Canada|date=23 June 2021}}</ref>

Eight early Christian buildings of Ravenna are inscribed on the [[World Heritage List]]. These are
* [[Baptistery of Neon|Orthodox Baptistery]] also called ''Baptistery of Neon'' ({{circa|430}})
* [[Mausoleum of Galla Placidia]] ({{circa|430}})
* [[Arian Baptistery]] ({{circa|500}})
* [[Archbishop's Chapel, Ravenna|Archiepiscopal Chapel]] ({{circa|500}})
* [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo]] ({{circa|500}})
* [[Mausoleum of Theodoric]] (520)
* [[Basilica of San Vitale]] (548)
* [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe]] (549)

Other historic sites include:
* The church of [[San Giovanni Evangelista, Ravenna|San Giovanni Evangelista]] is from the 5th century, erected by [[Galla Placidia]] after she survived a storm at sea. It was restored after the World War II bombings. The belltower contains four bells, the two majors dating back to 1208.
* The 6th-century church of the ''Spirito Santo'', which has been quite drastically altered since the 6th century. It was originally the Arian cathedral. The façade has a 16th-century portico with five arcades.
* The [[Basilica of San Francesco, Ravenna|Basilica of San Francesco]], rebuilt in the 10th–11th centuries over a precedent edifice dedicated to the Apostles and later to St. Peter. Behind the humble brick façade, it has a nave and two aisles. Fragments of mosaics from the first church are visible on the floor, which is usually covered by water after heavy rains (together with the crypt). Here the funeral ceremony of [[Dante Alighieri]] was held in 1321. The poet is buried in a tomb annexed to the church, the local authorities having resisted for centuries all demands by Florence for the return of the remains of its most famous exile.
* The [[Baroque]] church of ''Santa Maria Maggiore'' (525–532, rebuilt in 1671). It houses a picture by [[Luca Longhi]].
* The church of [[San Giovanni Battista, Ravenna|San Giovanni Battista]] (1683), also in Baroque style, with a Middle Ages campanile.
* The basilica of [[Santa Maria in Porto Basilica|Santa Maria in Porto]] (16th century), with a rich façade from the 18th century. It has a nave and two aisles, with a high [[cupola]]. It houses the image of famous ''Greek Madonna'', which was allegedly brought to Ravenna from Constantinople.
* The nearby Communal Gallery has various works from Romagnoli painters.
* The ''Rocca Brancaleone'' (Brancaleone Castle), built by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] in 1457. Once part of the city walls, it is now a public park. It is divided into two parts: the true Castle and the Citadel, the latter having an extent of {{convert|14000|m²|2|abbr=on}}.
* The "so-called Palace of Theodoric", in fact the entrance to the former church of [[Holy Saviour|San Salvatore]]. It includes mosaics from the [[Palace of Theodoric|true palace]] of the Ostrogoth king.
* The church of ''[[Sant'Eufemia, Ravenna|Sant'Eufemia]]'' (18th century), gives access to the so-called Stone Carpets Domus (6th–7th century): this houses splendid mosaics from a Byzantine palace.
* The National Museum
* The [[Archiepiscopal Museum, Ravenna|Archiepiscopal Museum]]
* The [[Capanno Garibaldi]], a [[hunting cabin]] on the road to {{Ill|Porto Corsini|it|}} known for having sheltered [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] on the night of 6–7 August 1849<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |date=21 May 2022 |title=La storia del capanno Garibaldi, in vetrina al Private Banking foto d'epoca e dipinti |trans-title=The history of the Garibaldi hut on display at Private Banking: Vintage photos and paintings |url=https://www.ilrestodelcarlino.it/ravenna/cronaca/la-storia-del-capanno-garibaldi-in-vetrina-al-private-banking-foto-depoca-e-dipinti-5951ef7a |access-date=4 April 2024 |website=[[Il Resto del Carlino]] |language=it}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web |date=20 May 2022 |title=Al "Private Banking" de La Cassa di Ravenna una nuova mostra dedicata al Capanno Garibaldi |trans-title=At the “Private Banking” of La Cassa di Ravenna, a new exhibition dedicated to the Capanno Garibaldi |url=https://www.ravennanotizie.it/cultura-spettacolo/2022/05/20/al-private-banking-de-la-cassa-di-ravenna-una-nuova-mostra-dedicata-a-il-capanno-garibaldi/ |access-date=4 April 2024 |website=ravennanotizie.it |language=it}}</ref>
