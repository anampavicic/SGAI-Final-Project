The name Thrissur ([[Malayalam]]: തൃശൂര്) is a shortened form of the Malayalam/Old Tamil word ''Thirusshivaperoor'' (തിരുശ്ശിവപ്പേരൂർ, Place of Lord Shiva's Name). The name owes itself to the most prominent feature of the city, which is the [[Vadakkumnathan Temple]], which has [[Shiva]] as its presiding deity.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Ukyp-gbtHcC&pg=PA7069 |title=The Indian Encyclopaedia|access-date=20 January 2013|isbn=9788177552577|year=2002|last1=Kapoor|first1=Subodh|publisher=Cosmo Publications }}</ref> Thrissur was known by its anglicized name Trichur until 1990 when the government decided to replace it with its Malayalam name.

The [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] had naval influence in many parts of [[Kerala]] in the 16th century, including Thrissur. At the beginning of the 17th century, the Portuguese naval power was reduced and [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] became the main naval power.

Thrissur rose to importance after Maharaja [[Sakthan Thampuran]] ascended the throne of the Kingdom of Cochin (1769–1805) and made Thrissur his capital. The Maharaja made the city into a major financial and commercial hub of [[South India]], by inviting [[Saint Thomas Christians|Syrian Christian]] families and [[Brahmins]] from adjoining areas.<ref name="Brief History" />

During 1750–60 [[Hyder Ali]], the Sultan of the powerful [[Kingdom of Mysore]], conquered Thrissur, making it a tributary of Mysore. In 1786, the son of [[Tipu Sultan]] of Mysore led another invasion of Thrissur but retreated after the Srirangapattanam war.<ref>{{cite web
