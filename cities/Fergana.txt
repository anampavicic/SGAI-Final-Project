'''Fergana''' ({{lang-uz-Latn-Cyrl|Fargʻona|Фарғона}}, {{IPA-uz|farʁɒna|pron}}), ({{langx|fa|فرغانه}}) or '''Ferghana''', also '''Farghana''' is a district-level city and the capital of [[Fergana Region]] in eastern [[Uzbekistan]].<ref name=class>{{cite web|url=https://stat.uz/uploads/docs/soato(mhobt)_2020.xlsx|title=Classification system of territorial units of the Republic of Uzbekistan|language=uz, ru|date=July 2020|publisher=The State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on statistics}}</ref> Fergana is about 420&nbsp;km east of [[Tashkent]], about 75&nbsp;km southwest of [[Andijan]], and less than 20&nbsp;km from the [[Kyrgyzstan]] border. The modern city was founded in 1876.

== History ==
[[File:32 Скобелев. Губернаторская ул.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Gubernatorskaya street, Ferghana, 1913]]
Fergana first appears in written records in the 5th-century. However, archeological evidence demonstrates that the city had been populated since the [[Chalcolithic]] period. Like many other [[Central Asia]]n places in the sixth and seventh-centuries, Fergana was ruled by the [[Western Turkic Khaganate]]. Although it was still predominantly inhabited by eastern Iranians, many Turks had also started to settle there.{{sfn|Bosworth|1999}} The city of Fergana was refounded in 1876 as a [[garrison]] town and colonial appendage to [[Margilan]] ({{convert|13+1/2|mi|km|0|abbr=off|order=flip|disp=or}} to the northwest) by the [[Russian Empire]].{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

[[Fergana Region]] is one of the centers of ancient culture in [[Uzbekistan]]. Photographs of [[Stone Age]] settlements and rocks found in the area show that stone tools have been used by people in the valley since [[Ancient history|ancient times]]. Excavations of the [[Great Fergana Canal]] have played an important role in the study of [[Archaeology|archaeological]] monuments in the region. During the excavation of the canal, monuments from the [[Bronze Age]], [[slavery]] and [[Land tenure|land ownership]] were discovered and studied. Finds from the 5th century BC and early medieval period in the town of [[Quva]] are well studied. Historical sources from the 10th to 11th century state that this city was the largest and most prosperous in the valley after [[Akhsikath]]. Archaeological materials confirm that the city of [[Margilan]] was a large [[village]] in the 10th century and took on the appearance of a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in the 11th and 12th centuries.

The monuments found in the settlements of the [[Chust culture]], engaged in sedentary [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]], are important for the study of the [[Fergana Valley]]. Archaeological excavations show that the [[Fergana Region]] has long been inhabited by people engaged in [[hunting]], [[Agriculture|farming]], animal husbandry, and at later stages of the existence of [[Society|human society]], [[culture]] began to develop.

It was initially named '''New Margelan''' ({{langx|ru|Новый Маргелан}}), then renamed Skobelov ({{lang|ru|Скобелев}}) in 1907 after the first Russian military governor of the Fergana Valley, [[Mikhail Skobelev]]. In 1924, after the [[Soviet Union]]'s reconquest of the region from the [[Basmachi movement]], the name was changed to '''Fergana''', after the province of which it was the centre.<ref>Dates of renaming taken from Adrian Room, ''Placenames of the World: Origins and Meanings of the Names for Over 5000 Natural Features, Countries, Capitals, Territories, Cities and Historical Sites'', McFarland, 1997, {{ISBN|0-7864-1814-1}} (pbk) p.124

The industrial base of Fergana was developed in the 20th century. Industry in the city included textile manufacturing and a nitric fertiliser plant.  Some of the industrial development was a result of [[Evacuation in the Soviet Union]] during World War II.<ref name="BishkekAndFerghana" />

Fergana has been a center for oil production in the Fergana Valley since the region's first [[oil refinery]] was built near the city in 1908. Since then, more refineries have been added, and Fergana is one of the most important centers of oil refining in Uzbekistan. [[Natural gas]] from western Uzbekistan is transported by [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] to the valley, where it is used to manufacture [[fertilizer]]. The [[Great Fergana Canal]], built almost entirely by hand during the 1930s, passes through the northern part of the city and was completed in 1939. During its construction, the canal and the city were widely photographed by the noted photographer [[Max Penson]]. With a western loan Fergana is able to modernize its refinery and also reduce [[air pollution]]<ref>[http://www.ebrd.com/new/pressrel/1997/03jan20x.htm Uzbekistan's Fergana Refinery is upgraded with EBRD finance 1997] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213080825/http://www.ebrd.com/new/pressrel/1997/03jan20x.htm |date=2007-12-13 }}</ref> emissions.
