'''Enschede''' ({{IPA|nl|ˈɛnsxədeː|lang|Nl-Enschede.ogg}}; local {{langx|twd|Eanske}} {{IPA|twd|ˈɛːnskə|}}) is a [[list of cities in the Netherlands by province|city]] and [[municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] in the province of [[Overijssel]] and the [[Twente]] region of the eastern [[Netherlands]]. The east of the urban area reaches the border of the [[Germany|German]] city of [[Gronau, North Rhine-Westphalia|Gronau]].

The municipality of Enschede consisted only of the city of Enschede until 1935, when the rural municipality of [[Lonneker]], which surrounded the city, was annexed after the rapid industrial expansion of Enschede that began in the 1860s and involved the building of railways and the digging of the [[Twentekanaal]].

Enschede is home to the [[association football|football]] club [[FC Twente]], a one-time [[List of Dutch football champions|Dutch champion]]; the [[University of Twente]]; and the last [[Polaroid B.V.|Polaroid]] film factory.

During the [[Carnival]] festivities, which take place in February or March, Enschede is temporarily renamed ''Krekkelstad'', after a local biscuit.

== Geography ==
[[File:Enschede-plaats-OpenTopo.jpg|left|thumb|Dutch Topographic map of Enschede (city), June 2014]]

Enschede lies in the eastern part of Overijssel and is the easternmost city of more than 140,000 inhabitants in the Netherlands. The city lies a few kilometres from [[Germany]], which borders the municipality. A few small rivers flow through or surround the city, such as the Roombeek and Glanerbeek.

Enschede contains five official city districts, which also include surrounding villages in the municipality:

*[[Stadsdeel Centrum (Enschede)|Stadsdeel Centrum]] (Binnenstad, Boddenkamp, De Bothoven, 't Getfert, Hogeland Noord, Horstlanden-Veldkamp, Laares, Lasonder-'t Zeggelt)
*[[Stadsdeel Noord (Enschede)|Stadsdeel Noord]] (for example: [[Lonneker]], Deppenbroek, Bolhaar, Mekkelholt, [[Roombeek]], Twekkelerveld)
*[[Stadsdeel Oost (Enschede)|Stadsdeel Oost]] (for example: Wooldrik, Velve-Lindenhof, De Eschmarke, 't Ribbelt, Stokhorst, Dolphia, 't Hogeland and [[Glanerbrug]])
*[[Stadsdeel Zuid (Enschede)|Stadsdeel Zuid]] (Wesselerbrink, Helmerhoek and Stroinkslanden)
*[[Stadsdeel West (Enschede)|Stadsdeel West]] (Boswinkel, Ruwenbos, Pathmos, Stadsveld, Bruggert, 't Zwering, 't Havengebied, De Marssteden, [[Boekelo]], [[Usselo]] and Twekkelo)

=== Climate ===
[[File:Rolling-thunder-cloud.jpg|thumb|220x220px|A [[shelf cloud]] associated with a heavy or severe thunderstorm over Enschede|left]]

Like most of the Netherlands, Enschede features an oceanic climate (Cfb in the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen classification]]), however, winters tend to be less mild than the rest of the Netherlands due to its inland location. Although the [[Enschede Airport Twente|former military airport]] is derelict and plans to revive the place were canceled in 2012, the [[Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute]] still maintains a weather station there.

== History ==
=== Preindustrial era ===
[[File:Stadhuis.Enschede.Hek1.jpg|thumb|right|Balcony of the city hall depicts Enschede received its city rights]]
[[File:Enschede jvd.jpg|thumb|Map of Enschede in 1570]]
The early history of Enschede is largely unknown, but a settlement existed around the Old Marketplace in early medieval times. The name of this settlement is mentioned as ''Anescede'' or Enscede meaning either "near the border" (with [[County of Bentheim (district)|Bentheim]]) or "near the Es" and sported a church, a marketplace and a fortified aristocratic house.<ref>[http://www.enschede-stad.nl/geschiedenis.htm enschede-stad.nl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214142158/http://enschede-stad.nl/geschiedenis.htm |date=2015-02-14 }}</ref>

Enschede was granted [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]] around 1300 which were confirmed in 1325 by Bishop [[Jan III van Diest]] and henceforth was allowed to protect itself with a wall. Because a stone wall was too expensive (since stone had to be imported), Enschede had a system of ditches, palisades and hedges instead, which is still reflected in the street-names ''Noorderhagen'' and ''Zuiderhagen'' (North Hedge and South Hedge, respectively). The city plan of this era is still recognisable in the street-pattern. The city was spared destruction in 1597 at [[Capture of Enschede (1597)|its capture]] during the [[Eighty Years' War]] when after a short siege, the Spanish garrison surrendered the city and the defences were razed.

Because the medieval city was largely built of wood and stone houses were the exception, fire was a constant risk and a series of fires in 1517, 1750 and again on 7 May 1862 earned the people from Enschede the nickname ''Brandstichters'' (arsonists).

=== Industrial era ===
The last fire coincided with the start of the growth of the city into a large production center for textiles, stimulating a large increase in population, which by 1894 had reached an estimated 18,267:<ref>The Century Cyclopaedia of Names, coordinated by Benjamin E Smith and published by the [[Theodore Low De Vinne|De Vinne Press]], New York 1894 (Page 363)</ref> nineteenth-century urban growth was at first rather chaotic. The names of the slums (like ''De Krim'' and ''Sebastopol'') are still notorious, although they have long since been torn down.{{cn|date=January 2023}} In 1907 the ''laissez faire'' mentality was dropped and Enschede was the first city in the Netherlands to draw up an official expansion plan, incorporating the surrounding municipality of [[Lonneker]].{{cn|date=January 2023}}

Textile production, originally a cottage industry, reached an industrial scale at the start of the 19th century. In particular, ''bombazijn'' (a mixture of cotton and linen) proved a successful export. One such factory to have produced textiles in the late 19th century is the [[Hardick & Seckel Factory]].{{cn|date=January 2023}}

=== World War II ===
[[File:Britse soldaten van het Seventh Hampshire Regiment rukken op van Enschede naar H, Bestanddeelnr 900-2374.jpg|thumb|British troops advancing from Enschede, April 1945]]
During [[World War II]], Enschede was one of the first Dutch cities to be captured by German troops, being the city closest to Germany. Resistance members helped many of the Jews from Enschede to hide on farms in the vicinity. Out of approximately 1300 Jews in Enschede, 500 were saved (38.5%), compared to less than 20% in the rest of the Netherlands. This higher survival rate is attributed to three members of the Jewish Council of Enschede, Sig Menko, Gerard Sanders and Isidoor Van Dam who took the initiative, against the advice of the Jewish Council of Amsterdam, of urging their community to go into hiding and not to answer the call-up of the Germans for "labour in the East." Another notable hero of the era was Enschede Pastor Leendert Overduin, who saved hundreds of Jewish children and adults, with help from his sister and others, through a network of safehouses in and around Enschede.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

Enschede was bombed on several occasions, most notably on 10 October 1943, and 22 February 1944. During the first raid the [[Enschede Airport Twente|nearby airport]] (then ''Fliegerhorst Twente'') was a target of opportunity for the [[Eighth Air Force|VIII Bomber Command]] during a raid on rail- and waterways in [[Münster]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://paul.rutgers.edu/~mcgrew/wwii/usaf/html/Oct.43.html |title=USAAF Chronology |access-date=2016-05-10 |archive-date=2020-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200714053330/http://paul.rutgers.edu/~mcgrew/wwii/usaf/html/Oct.43.html |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.americanairmuseum.com/mission/1509 |title=American Air Museum in Britain, mission 114 |access-date=2016-05-10 |archive-date=2016-06-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610105249/http://www.americanairmuseum.com/mission/1509 |url-status=live }}</ref> 141 people died and many houses were damaged.{{cn|date=October 2022}} The latter mission named Enschede as a target of opportunity during [[Big Week]] after bombers had been recalled due to adverse weather.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.americanairmuseum.com/mission/790 |title=American Air Museum in Britain, 8th Air Force 230 BIG WEEK – DAY 3 |access-date=2016-05-10 |archive-date=2016-06-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610110811/http://www.americanairmuseum.com/mission/790 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== The end of the industrial age ===
In the 1960s, the textile industry was completely lost, at the cost of approximately 30,000 jobs. Most of the large factory complexes were demolished in the 1970s and 1980s, some were renovated and given a new purpose. For example, homes were built in the former factories of Jannink and Van Heek. In addition, part of the Jannink complex was converted into a [[museum]]. Enschede developed into a service city.

In the 1970s the textile production in Enschede came to a halt, due to fierce competition from mainly the [[Far East]]. This had a profound effect on the populace. Enschede became one of the poorest municipalities in the Netherlands and went bankrupt. Large areas of industrial wasteland came to mark the city. With the support of the national government, this property was acquired and rebuilt. The city center was rendered a [[car-free zone]].

[[File:Fireworks disaster monument.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Monument commemorating the [[Enschede fireworks disaster]]. The inscription says, "The vanished house between heaven and earth."]]In 1961 it was announced a third technical university would be founded, placed on an estate on the western border of Enschede. This green campus called Drienerlo was donated by the city of Enschede. Building was complete in 1964, when the first and only full-facility university of the Netherlands was realised.

On 13 May 2000, a [[fireworks]] storage depot in Enschede [[Enschede fireworks disaster|exploded]], destroying part of the neighborhood of [[Roombeek]] and killing 23 people, including 4 firemen. In 2001 a [[referendum]] confirmed the proposal of the city council to expand the built-up area into the [[Usseler Es]], an area of historic cultural significance and of geological importance, as it was here that the [[Usselo#Usselo Soil|Usselo horizon]] was discovered. The renovations at Roombeek were finished in the year 2012. The place where the factory used to be is now a monument.

The Alpha Tower was completed in 2008 and this tower block with 91 apartments spread over 29 floors, with a height of 101 meters, is the tallest building in Enschede and the whole province of Overijssel. In the period 1995–2010, Enschede grew by approximately 10,000 inhabitants, but since then the growth has stagnated.<ref>{{cite web |title=CBS Statline |url=https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/70072NED/table?dl=25421 |access-date=2021-07-19 |website=opendata.cbs.nl |language=nl |archive-date=2019-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190725200732/https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/70072NED/table?dl=25421 |url-status=live }}</ref>

}}The largest religion in Enschede is Christianity with 34.9% of the population being Christian.

Enschede has a large [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] community, the first Assyrians came to Enschede in the 1970s, primarily from Turkey ([[Tur Abdin]]). Today there are three [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]es in the city which meet the spiritual needs of Enschede's more than 10,000 Assyrians.<ref>{{cite web |title=UNPO: Assyria: MEP Support for Assyrian Cause |url=https://unpo.org/article/9640 |access-date=2022-04-21 |website=unpo.org |archive-date=2022-05-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220526145119/https://unpo.org/article/9640 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=2009-05-06 |title=Enschede Marathon, in honor of Mor Gabriel and the Assyrian Genocide, Seyfo of 1915 |url=https://www.seyfocenter.com/english/52/ |access-date=2022-04-21 |website=Seyfocenter |language=en-US |archive-date=2022-12-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221207035817/https://www.seyfocenter.com/english/52/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Economy ==
[[File:Enschede NL 18 25 48 441000.jpeg|alt=|left|thumb|220x220px|Enschede city center]]
The city is a former centre of textile production. When this industry left the area for cheaper production centers in South-East Asia, Enschede became one of the poorest municipalities in the Netherlands. More educated and wealthier citizens have historically migrated to the [[Randstad]] region; decades of renovation work in the city center have been carried out with the goal of making Enschede more attractive to this group.
Modern shopping centres and department stores that until recently were only found in much larger cities have been opened. Enschede is host to many yearly festivals and the Old Market Square is often the venue for events, live music and other activities at the weekend.

The proximity to Germany has, historically, been another major factor in the city's economic activity, ranging from the smuggling of coffee and tobacco in the 19th and 20th century, to large numbers of Germans, who visit the city's shops and weekly markets. Therefore, many natives of Enschede speak German more or less fluently.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

The city is co-operating with the nearby municipalities of [[Almelo]], [[Borne (Overijssel)|Borne]] and [[Hengelo]] as ''Netwerkstad Twente''. A draft law plan to merge Enschede with Hengelo and Almelo was defeated in parliament under the influence of opposition from the other towns.

[[Grolsch]] beer is brewed in Enschede, and the tyre manufacturer [[Apollo Vredestein B.V.]] head office and a factory is in the city. It is one of the most important employers of the region.

=== Museum ===
[[File:Enschede - 2021 - Rijksmuseum Twenthe.jpg|thumb|220x220px|[[Rijksmuseum Twenthe]]]]
There are several museums in Enschede, among them the [[Rijksmuseum Twenthe]] for art. A museum of natural history and a museum dedicated to the history of the [[textiles]] industry, both closed in January 2007, have merged, and have reopened in April 2008 in new premises on a new location under the name [http://www.twentsewelle.nl TwentseWelle] (Source/Well of Twente). The new location is situated in [[Roombeek]], where a fireworks disaster took place in 2000. The new museum is located partly in a renovated old textile factory, in reference to Enschede's textile history, and partly in an adjourning new building, designed by the Amsterdam-based firm SeARCH (project architect: Bjarne Mastenbroek). Besides museums there are also several art spaces, the most prominent being [[Villa de Bank]] and TETEM. The latter focuses on art and technology, and aims to be accessible for a wide public.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tetem – Uit in Enschede (in Dutch)|url=https://www.uitinenschede.nl/locaties/tetem|access-date=12 August 2018|archive-date=12 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180812114954/https://www.uitinenschede.nl/locaties/tetem|url-status=live}}</ref>
Enschede is also home of The Netherlands Symphony Orchestra.

[[De Museumfabriek]] (formerly TwensteWelle) is a museum in the [[Roombeek]] district that arose from a merger of three institutions: Natuurmuseum Enschede, [[Van Deinse Instituut]] and Fabriekcomplex Jannink. In this museum, the cultural-historical heritage of [[Twente]] is linked to the natural-historical heritage, a unique combination for the Netherlands. The museum was opened in April 2008 by the then [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]].

=== Music and theater ===
[[File:Atak.jpg|thumb|Former building of Atak Poppodium|293x293px]]
The German-Dutch relationship is characteristic of music culture, which arose through cooperation in the border region and the dominant [[textile industry]] in the 19th and 20th centuries. Especially during the period of reversal after the [[World War I]], a close German-Dutch cultural cooperation developed in [[Gronau, North Rhine-Westphalia|Gronau]] and Enschede, which became increasingly important from string quartets, salon orchestras and hot dance music bands to symphony orchestras and an operetta company ("Enschedesch Opera en Operette Gezelschap") with their own performances. At the same time, jazz also found enthusiastic supporters from 1920 onwards.

The three major concert stages for classical music in Enschede – the Muziekcentrum, the Twentse Schouwburg and the Grote Kerk – have been operating under the name Podium Twente since September 2002 and since September 2011 under the name Wilminktheater en Muziekcentrum Enschede. There is a varied offer of concerts, theater, youth and youth performances and the like to visit.

In November 2008 the Nationaal Muziekkwartier opened its doors in Enschede. A new large theatre, pop stage Atak, the ArtEZ Conservatory, the Orkest van het Oosten (now the Dutch Symphony Orchestra), the Twente Music School, the Nationale Reisopera (now the Nederlandse Reisopera) and Podium Twente (now Wilminktheater en Muziekcentrum Enschede) have settled in this dominant building opposite the Central Station in Enschede. There will be a new large square, the Willem Wilminkplein.

In December 2012, the [[Serious Request]] action from national radio station [[3FM]] took place in Enschede, which collected more than 12.2&nbsp;million euros (almost US$16.2&nbsp;million).

==Research, education and health care==
[[File:University-of-twente-letters.jpg|left|thumb|[[University of Twente]]]]
The [[University of Twente]] (''Universiteit Twente''), a university with mostly technical studies, is located in Enschede. It is one of the four technical universities in the Netherlands (besides [[Delft University of Technology]], [[Eindhoven University of Technology]] and the [[Wageningen University and Research Centre]]). The Universiteit Twente is also the only large-campus university in the Netherlands.

The university has courses in pure technical studies such as Applied Physics, Applied Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Informatics/Computer Science and Industrial Engineering and also offers study programmes in Communication, Psychology, Economic Sciences, International Business Administration, Public Administration, Applied Medicine and Biomedical Technology; the latter attract a broader public. Since 2006, the programmes of European Studies, Advanced Technology, Creative Technology and ATLAS University College have been added to the university's offerings.

The Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation of the University of Twente, with former name International Institute for Aerospace Survey and Earth Sciences, (known by its abbreviation [[ITC Enschede|ITC]]) runs MSc, Master's, Diploma and PhD courses in Geo-Information Science for developing countries. Students from all over the world attend the ITC. Enschede also has an [[Art school|academy of arts and design]] combined with a [[Music school|conservatory]] named ArtEZ.
[[File:Hogeschool Saxion - stadscampus Enschede.jpg|thumb|[[Saxion University of Applied Sciences]]]]
Enschede is also home to one of the three campuses of [[Saxion University of Applied Sciences]] (''Saxion Hogeschool''), a [[Vocational universities in The Netherlands|polytechnical school]] offering internationally recognized [[Bachelor's degrees]] and [[Master's degrees]] in a wide range of fields, including engineering, economics, social work, investigations and health care.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.saxion.edu/ |title=Saxion University of Applied Sciences (english site) |publisher=Saxion.edu |access-date=2012-03-19 |archive-date=2010-02-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225080711/http://www.saxion.edu/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The other campuses are located in [[Deventer]] and [[Apeldoorn]].

The [[Medisch Spectrum Twente]] (MST) hospital is one of the largest top-clinical hospitals of the Netherlands and features important tertiary care departments, fulfilling a supraregional role. It includes a [[level I trauma center]] as well. The hospital is strongly involved in higher medical education, with up to 300 medical students following their internships in the hospital at any given time, closely working together with the University of Twente's Technical Medicine program training a new type of technically specialized doctors.

==Transport==
=== Train ===
[[File:001-1211 Enschede 001.JPG|thumb|300x300px|[[Enschede railway station]]]]
[[Enschede railway station|Enschede]] is a terminus [[railway station|station]] of the [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]] (NS) [[railway]] lines from the west. Trains operate to [[Hengelo railway station|Hengelo]], [[Almelo railway station|Almelo]], [[Zwolle railway station|Zwolle]], [[Deventer railway station|Deventer]], [[Apeldoorn railway station|Apeldoorn]], [[Amersfoort Centraal railway station|Amersfoort Centraal]], [[Hilversum railway station|Hilversum]], [[Amsterdam Zuid railway station|Amsterdam Zuid]], [[Schiphol Airport railway station|Schiphol Airport]], [[Utrecht Centraal railway station|Utrecht Centraal]] and [[Den Haag Centraal railway station|Den Haag Centraal]].

To the east there is a line to [[Gronau, North Rhine-Westphalia|Gronau]], [[Germany]], which has two more stations in the Netherlands: [[Enschede De Eschmarke railway station|Enschede De Eschmarke]] and [[Glanerbrug railway station|Glanerbrug]]. The latter two have low ridership.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} The line is served by [[DB Regionalbahn Westfalen]] (part of the [[Germany|German]] [[Deutsche Bahn]]), to [[Münster]] and to [[Dortmund]], each on an hourly interval and alternating half-hours in the service to [[Gronau, North Rhine-Westphalia|Gronau]].

There is no track connection between the two systems. The through line had been retained for eventual [[NATO]] use during the [[Cold War]] even after through passenger service was ended (September 1981), although it was in serious disrepair in later years. With the renewal of service to Germany (May 2001) the track was severed; there is a gap of about 30 centimeters between them<ref>[http://www.et.fh-muenster.de/eisenbahn/Gronau_Enschede.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622042942/http://www.et.fh-muenster.de/eisenbahn/Gronau_Enschede.html|date=22 June 2008}}</ref> which means that Enschede is now a "double terminus station" with tracks to the West (the Netherlands) and to the East (Germany) but with no connection between them.

There is also [[Enschede Kennispark railway station]], near the football stadium.

=== Bus ===
[[File:Syntus Twente buses Enschede 2019.jpg|thumb|Twents bus by [[Keolis Nederland|Syntus]] in Enshede]]
Enschede is situated at the south-east terminus of the [[Twentekanaal]]. There is also a network of bus lines connecting nearly every part of the city with the centre. Enschede also has bus connections to nearby towns and cities, like [[Hengelo]], [[Oldenzaal]] and south towards [[Haaksbergen]], [[Neede]] and [[Eibergen]]. The city lines are operated by [[Syntus]], under the [[Twents]]-branche. The interlocal lines are exploited by [[Keolis Nederland|Syntus]] and [[Arriva]].

=== Air ===
Previously, Enschede had a combined regional civil airport, [[Enschede Airport Twente|Enschede Airport]], and Airbase Twenthe of the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]]. The latter was closed in 2007; the former was closed in 2008. However, it remains in operation for business air traffic flying via a charter or private jet, and recreational flights.<ref>{{cite web |title=Vliegen |url=https://www.twente-airport.nl/vliegen/ |access-date=2022-01-28 |website=www.twente-airport.nl |archive-date=2022-01-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220128133120/https://www.twente-airport.nl/vliegen/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Roads ===
Around the center districts of Enschede is a complete ring road with a length of approximately 8&nbsp;km, which is popularly called "de singel". This was constructed in the period between 1916 and 1929.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-10-31 |title=Singels van Enschede – Architectuurgids Enschede – Enschede, stad van nu |url=http://www.architectuurgidsenschede.nl/objects/object00000056/ |access-date=2022-05-18 |website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181031005324/http://www.architectuurgidsenschede.nl/objects/object00000056/ |archive-date=31 October 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Most major arterial roads connect to the canal. Enschede is connected to the national road network by means of the [[Rijksweg 35|A/N35]] and the [[A15 motorway (Netherlands)|N18]]. Below and on the edge of the center are various parking facilities, the most famous and largest of which is the Van Heekgarage, which is located under the Van Heekplein. At the end of 2012, construction of an additional entrance and exit at Kuipersdijk was started as the South entrance. Van Heekgarage is the largest underground parking garage in the Netherlands with a capacity of 1650 cars.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2008-04-20 |title=Enschede – Van Heekgarage |url=http://www.parkereninenschede.nl/parkeergarages/00002/ |access-date=2022-05-18 |website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420194231/http://www.parkereninenschede.nl/parkeergarages/00002/ |archive-date=20 April 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Since the 2019–2020 season, they are back in the Eredivisie. [[De Grolsch Veste|De Grolsch Veste Stadium]] is the club's home base and has a capacity of 30,205 spectators.
The [[Enschede Marathon]] is the second oldest marathon in Europe, and the oldest in the Netherlands, having been run annually since 1947. DOS-WK played in the [[Korfbal League]] until 2006.
