'''Saint-Denis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|æ̃|d|ə|ˈ|n|iː}}, {{IPA|fr|sɛ̃d(ə)ni|lang|LL-Q150 (fra)-Harmonia Amanda-Saint-Denis.wav}}) is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the northern suburbs of [[Paris, France]]. It is located {{cvt|9.4|km}} from the [[Kilometre zero|centre of Paris]]. Saint-Denis is the second most populated suburb of Paris (after [[Boulogne-Billancourt]]), with a population of 113,116 at the 2020 census. It is a [[Subprefectures in France|subprefecture]] ({{langx|fr|sous-préfecture}}) of the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Seine-Saint-Denis]], being the seat of the [[Arrondissement of Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|arrondissement of Saint-Denis]]. It is also part of the [[Métropole du Grand Paris]].

Saint-Denis is home to the royal necropolis of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] and was also the location of the associated [[abbey]].

The commune is also home to France's national football and rugby stadium, the [[Stade de France]], which was built for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]. The stadium also hosted the [[Rugby sevens at the 2024 Summer Olympics|rugby]] and [[Athletics at the 2024 Summer Olympics|athletics]] events, along with the [[2024 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]], for the [[2024 Summer Olympics]]. The [[Athletics at the 2024 Summer Paralympics|athletics events]] & [[2024 Summer Paralympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]] for the [[2024 Summer Paralympics]] were also held at the stadium.

Saint-Denis is a formerly [[industrial suburb]] currently changing its economic base. It is set to become the second most populated commune in Île-de-France after Paris on 1 January 2025 upon the absorption of [[Pierrefitte-sur-Seine]] to its north, following a vote of both municipal councils on 30 May 2024.<ref>{{cite news <!--Citation bot bypass-->|first1=Hélène|last1=Haus|first2=Mathilde|last2=Debarre|language=fr|date=30 May 2024|title=" Un moment solennel, historique " : Saint-Denis et Pierrefitte-sur-Seine se sont dit " oui " et fusionnent|newspaper=[[Le Parisien]]|place=Paris|issn=0767-3558|url=https://www.leparisien.fr/seine-saint-denis-93/un-moment-solennel-historique-saint-denis-et-pierrefitte-sur-seine-se-sont-dit-oui-et-fusionnent-30-05-2024-EJ7PLZMPUNHTHBZI33OXXM32IA.php}}</ref>

==Name==
Until the 3rd century, Saint-Denis was a small settlement called ''Catolacus'' or ''Catulliacum'', probably meaning "estate of Catullius", a [[Gallo-Roman]] landowner. About 250 AD, the first [[bishop of Paris]], [[Saint Denis of Paris|Saint Denis]], was martyred on [[Montmartre]] hill and buried in ''Catolacus''. Shortly after 250 AD, his grave became a shrine and a pilgrimage centre, with the building of the [[Saint Denis Basilica|Abbey of Saint Denis]], and the settlement was renamed Saint-Denis.

In 1793, during the [[French Revolution]], under the dictatorship of Robespierre, Saint-Denis was renamed ''Franciade'' in a gesture of rejection of religion. In 1803, however, under the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] of [[Napoleon|Napoléon Bonaparte]], the city reverted to its former name of Saint-Denis.

==History==
During its history, Saint-Denis has been closely associated with the French royal house. Starting from [[Dagobert I]] (c. 603&ndash;639), almost every French king was buried in the Basilica.

However, Saint-Denis is older than that. In the 2nd century, there was a [[Gallo-Roman]] village named ''Catolacus'' on the location that Saint-Denis occupies today. [[Saint Denis of Paris|Saint Denis]], the first bishop of Paris and patron saint of France, was martyred in about 250 AD and buried in the cemetery of Catolacus. Denis' tomb quickly became a place of worship. Around 475 AD, [[Genevieve|Sainte Geneviève]] had a small chapel erected on Denis' tomb, which by then had become a popular destination for pilgrims. It was this chapel that Dagobert I had rebuilt and turned into a royal monastery. Dagobert granted many privileges to the monastery: independence from the bishop of Paris, [[Market town|the right to hold a market]], and, most importantly, he was buried in Saint-Denis; a tradition which was followed by almost all his successors. During the [[Middle Ages]], because of the privileges granted by Dagobert, Saint-Denis grew to become very important. Merchants from all over [[Europe]] (and indeed from the [[Byzantine Empire]]) came to visit its market.

In 1140, [[Abbot Suger]], counselor to the King, granted further privileges to the citizens of Saint-Denis. He also started the work of enlarging the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]] that still exists today, often cited as the first example of high early [[Gothic Architecture]].<ref>Rolf, Toman (ed.) (2004). ''Der Gothisch''. Ullmann & Könemann</ref><ref>Swaan, Wim (1969). ''The Gothic Cathedral''</ref> The new church was consecrated in 1144.

Saint-Denis was depopulated in the [[Hundred Years' War]]; of its 10,000 citizens, only 3,000 remained after the war.

[[File:Battle of Saint Denis 1567.jpg|thumb|left|[[Battle of Saint-Denis (1567)]].]]
During the [[French Wars of Religion]], the [[Battle of Saint-Denis (1567)|Battle of Saint-Denis]] was fought between [[Catholic]]s and [[Protestant]]s on 10 November 1567. The Protestants were defeated, but the Catholic commander [[Anne de Montmorency]] was killed. In 1590, the city surrendered to [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], who converted to Catholicism in 1593 in the abbey of Saint-Denis.

King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] (1638&ndash;1715) started several industries in Saint-Denis: weaving and spinning mills and dyehouses. His successor, [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] (1710&ndash;1774), whose daughter was a nun in the [[Carmelite]] [[convent]], took a lively interest in the city: he added a chapel to the convent and also renovated the buildings of the royal abbey.

[[File:Maison d'Education de la Legion d'Honneur.jpg|thumb|[[Maison d'éducation de la Légion d'honneur]] de Saint-Denis.]]
During the French Revolution, not only was the city renamed "Franciade" from 1793 to 1803, but the royal [[necropolis]] was looted and destroyed. The remains were removed from the tombs and thrown together; during the [[French Restoration]], since they could not be sorted out anymore, they were reburied in a common [[ossuary]].

[[File:Saint-Denis 1830.jpg|thumb|left|Saint-Denis in 1830.]]
The last king to be interred in Saint-Denis was [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] (1755&nbsp;– 1824). After France became a [[French Second Republic|republic]] and an [[French Second Empire|empire]], Saint-Denis lost its association with royalty.

On 1 January 1860, the city of [[Paris]] was enlarged by annexing neighbouring communes. On that occasion, the commune of [[La Chapelle-Saint-Denis]] was disbanded and divided between the city of Paris, Saint-Denis, [[Saint-Ouen, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Ouen]], and [[Aubervilliers]]. Saint-Denis received the north-western part of La Chapelle-Saint-Denis.

During the 19th century, Saint-Denis became increasingly industrialised. Transport was much improved: in 1824 the [[Canal Saint-Denis]] was constructed, linking the [[Canal de l'Ourcq]] in the northeast of Paris to the River [[Seine]] at the level of [[L'Île-Saint-Denis]], and in 1843 the first [[railway]] reached Saint-Denis. By the end of the century, there were 80 factories in Saint-Denis.

The presence of so many industries also gave rise to an important [[socialist movement]]. In 1892, Saint-Denis elected its first [[socialist]] administration, and by the 1920s, the city had acquired the nickname of ''la ville rouge'', the red city. Until [[Jacques Doriot]] in 1934, all [[mayors]] of Saint-Denis were members of the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]].

During the [[Second World War]], after the [[Battle of France|defeat of France]], Saint-Denis was occupied by the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] on 13 June 1940. There were several acts of sabotage and [[Strike action|strikes]], most notably on 14 April 1942 at the [[Hotchkiss et Cie|Hotchkiss]] factory. After an [[insurgency]] which started on 18 August 1944, Saint-Denis was liberated by the [[2nd Armored Division (France)]] on 27 August 1944.

After the war, the economic crisis of the 1970s and 1980s hit the city, which was strongly dependent on its heavy industry.

During the 1990s, however, the city started to grow again. The 1998 FIFA World Cup provided an enormous impulse; the main stadium for the tournament, the [[Stade de France]], was built in Saint-Denis, along with many infrastructural improvements, such as the extension of the [[Paris Métro|metro]] to Saint-Denis-Université. The stadium is used by the national [[France national football team|football]] and [[French rugby union team|rugby]] teams for friendly matches. The [[Coupe de France]], [[Coupe de la Ligue]] and [[Top 14]] final matches are held there, as well as the [[Meeting Areva]] international athletics event.

[[File:Saint-Denis rue Gabriel-Peri.jpg|thumb|Rue Gabriel Péri, a pedestrian zone in Saint-Denis, in 2012.]]
Since 2000, Saint-Denis has worked with seven neighbouring ''communes'' ([[Aubervilliers]], [[Villetaneuse]], [[Pierrefitte-sur-Seine]], [[Épinay-sur-Seine]], [[L'Île-Saint-Denis]] (since 2003), [[Stains, Seine-Saint-Denis|Stains]] (since 2003), and [[La Courneuve]] (since 2005)) in [[Plaine Commune]].

In 2003, together with Paris, Saint-Denis hosted the second [[European Social Forum]].

On 13–14 November 2015, Saint-Denis was the main location of [[November 2015 Paris attacks|a series of mass shootings and hostage-takings]] just outside the Stade de France. On 18 November, [[2015 Saint-Denis raid|a major follow-up raid]] occurred. Several suspects were killed, including alleged mastermind [[Abdelhamid Abaaoud]].<ref name=reuters-spider>{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-shooting-idUSKCN0T22IU20151120#UeBb3YPIY0DOiPKK.97 |title='Spider in web' mastermind of Paris attacks killed in raid |publisher=Reuters |date=19 November 2015 |access-date=20 November 2015 |first1=John |last1=Irish |first2=Gregory |last2=Blachier}}</ref>
