'''Arnhem''' ({{IPA|nl|ˈɑrnɛm|lang|nl-Arnhem.ogg}} {{IPA|nl|ˈɑr(ə)nɦɛm||Nl-Arnhem.oga|label=or}}; {{langx|de|Arnheim}} {{IPA|de|ˈaʁnhaɪm||De-Arnheim.ogg}}; [[Central Dutch dialects|Ernems]]: ''Èrnem'') is a [[Cities of the Netherlands|city]] and [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] situated in the eastern part of the [[Netherlands]], near the German border. It is the capital of the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[Gelderland]], located on both banks of the rivers [[Nederrijn]] and [[Sint-Jansbeek]], which was the source of the city's development. 

Arnhem is home to the [[Hogeschool van Arnhem en Nijmegen]], [[ArtEZ Institute of the Arts]], [[Netherlands Open Air Museum]], [[Airborne Museum 'Hartenstein']], [[Royal Burgers' Zoo]], [[NOC*NSF]] and [[National Sports Centre Papendal]]. The north corner of the municipality is part of the [[Hoge Veluwe National Park]]. It is approximately {{convert|55|km2|sqmi}} in area, consisting of heathlands, sand dunes, and woodlands.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

== History ==
=== Early history ===
[[File:Springer-Arnhem.png|thumb|left|Old city hall]]

The oldest archeological findings of human activity around Arnhem are two firestones of about 70,000 years ago. These come from the [[Stone Age]], when the [[Neanderthal]]s lived in this part of [[Europe]]. In Schuytgraaf, remnants of a hunters camp from around 5000 BC have been discovered. In [[Schaarsbergen]], twelve grave mounds were found from 2400 BC, which brought the so-called [[Neolithic Revolution]] to the area of Arnhem, which meant the rise of the farmers.

The earliest settlement in Arnhem dates from 1500 BC, of which traces have been found on the Hoogkamp, where the Van Goyenstraat is currently located. In the inner city, around the [[Sint-Jansbeek]], traces of settlement have been found from around 700 BC, while the first traces south of the [[Rhine]] have been found dating to around 500 BC, in the ''Schuytgraaf''.

Though the early tracks of settlements did show that the early residents of Arnhem descended from the forests on the hills, Arnhem was not built on the banks of the river Rhine, but a little higher along the Sint-Jansbeek. Arnhem arose on the location where the road between [[Nijmegen]] and [[Utrecht]] and [[Zutphen]] split. Seven streams provided the city with water, and only when the flow of the Rhine was changed in 1530, was the city located on the river.

=== Middle Ages ===

Arnhem was first mentioned as such in 893 as ''Arneym'' or ''Arentheym''. In 1233, Count [[Otto II, Count of Guelders|Otto II]] of [[County of Guelders|Guelders]] from [[Zutphen]], conferred [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]] on the town, which had belonged to the abbey of Prüm, settled in, and fortified it. Arnhem entered the [[Hanseatic League]] in 1443.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Arnhem | title=Arnhem &#124; Netherlands &#124; Britannica | date=May 2023 }}</ref> In 1473, it was captured by [[Charles the Bold]] of Burgundy.

=== 16th and 17th century ===

In 1514, [[Charles of Egmond]], [[duke]] of [[Duchy of Guelders|Guelders]], took it from the dukes of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]]; in 1543, it fell to the [[emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. As capital of the so-called "Kwartier van Veluwe" it joined the [[Union of Utrecht]] during the [[Eighty Years' War]] in 1579. After [[Siege of IJsseloord|its capture from the Spanish forces]] by Dutch and English troops in 1585 the city became part of the [[Dutch Republic|Republic of the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Arnhem | title=Arnhem &#124; Netherlands &#124; Britannica | date=May 2023 }}</ref> The French occupied the town from 1672 to 1674.

=== 18th and 19th century ===
[[File:20140822 Huis Zypendaal3 Arnhem.jpg|thumb|Huis Zypendaal]]

From 1795 to 1813, it was reoccupied by the French, by both revolutionary and imperial forces.

In the early 19th century, the former fortifications were almost completely dismantled, to give space for town expansion. The ''Sabelspoort'' (Sabresgate) is the only remaining part of the medieval walls.

In the 19th century, Arnhem was a genteel resort town famous for its picturesque beauty. It was known as "het Haagje van het oosten" (The Little Hague of the East), mainly because a number of rich former sugar barons or planters from the Indies settled there, as they did in [[The Hague]]. Even now the city is famous for its parks and greenery. The urbanization in the north on hilly terrain is also quite unusual for the Netherlands.

=== World War II ===
{{Main|Battle of Arnhem}}
During the German occupation ([[World War II]]), the occupiers operated a subcamp of the [[Herzogenbusch concentration camp]] in the city.<ref>{{cite book|last=Megargee|first=Geoffrey P.|year=2009|title=The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos 1933–1945. Volume I|publisher=Indiana University Press, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|page=820|isbn=978-0-253-35328-3}}</ref>

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S73820, Arnheim, britische Gefangene.jpg|thumb|left|Battle of Arnhem]]
During [[Operation Market Garden]] (September 1944), the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Airborne Division]], under the command of [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Roy Urquhart]], and the [[1st Independent Parachute Brigade (Poland)|Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade]] were given the task of securing the [[bridge]] at Arnhem.

[[Glider infantry]] and [[paratrooper]] units were landed into the area on 17 September and later.  The bulk of the force was dropped rather far from the bridge and never met their objective.  A small element of the British 1st Airborne, the [[2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment|2nd Parachute Battalion]] under [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[John Frost (British Army officer)|John D. Frost]], managed to make its way as far as the bridge but was unable to secure both sides. The British troops encountered stiff resistance from the German [[9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen|9th]] and [[10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg|10th SS Panzer Division]]s, which had been stationed in and around the city.

[[File:John Frostbrug 2017.jpg|thumb|The [[John Frost Bridge]], seen from the Airborne memorial]]
The British force at the bridge eventually ran out of ammunition and was captured on 21 September, and a full withdrawal of the remaining forces was made on 26 September. These events were dramatized in the 1977 movie ''[[A Bridge Too Far (1977 film)|A Bridge Too Far]]''. (The bridge scenes in the movie were shot in [[Deventer]], where a similar bridge over the [[IJssel]] was available, as the area around Arnhem bridge had changed too much to represent WWII-era Arnhem). As a tribute, the rebuilt bridge was renamed '[[John Frost Bridge]]' after the commander of the paratroopers. The official commemoration is 17 September.

The current bridge is the third almost-identical bridge built at the same spot. The [[Dutch Army]] destroyed the first bridge when the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] [[Battle of the Netherlands|invaded the Netherlands]] in 1940. The second bridge was destroyed by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] shortly after the 1944 battle.

=== Liberation ===

{{Main|Liberation of Arnhem}}
A second battle of Arnhem took place in April 1945 when the city was liberated by the British [[49th (West Riding) Infantry Division]] fighting as part of the [[First Canadian Army]]. The inhabitants of the city, who had been forcibly evacuated by the Germans during and after the battle, returned in the summer of 1945. The reconstruction of Arnhem took until 1969 to finally be completed.

Just outside Arnhem, in the town of Oosterbeek the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] built the [[Arnhem Oosterbeek War Cemetery]] which contains the graves of most of those killed during the September landings, and many of those killed in later fighting in the area.

The city also hosted the [[1980 Summer Paralympics]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.paralympic.org/arnhem-1980 | title=Arnhem 1980 }}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:Gem-Arnhem-OpenTopo.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|Topographic map of Arnhem.]]

=== Neighbourhoods ===

The municipality of Arnhem consists of the city of Arnhem and the following surrounding suburbs and former villages:
* [[Elden, Netherlands]] (former village, now totally surrounded by other Arnhem neighbourhoods)
* Schaarsbergen

Arnhem consists of three districts (''stadsdelen'') and 24 neighbourhoods (''wijken''). Each neighbourhood has a number which corresponds to its [[Postal codes in the Netherlands|postal code]].

# Arnhem Centrum ''(Binnenstad)'' 
# Arnhem-North ''(Spijkerkwartier, Arnhemse Broek, Presikhaaf-West, Presikhaaf-East, St. Marten/Sonsbeek-Zuid, Klarendal, Velperweg, Alteveer en Cranevelt, Geitenkamp, Monnikenhuizen, Burgemeesterswijk/Hoogkamp, Heijenoord/Lombok, Klingelbeek)'' 
# Arnhem-South ''(Malburgen-West, Malburgen-East (North), Malburgen-East (South), De Laar East/West, Vredenburg/Kronenburg, Elderveld, Rijkerswoerd, Schuytgraaf)''

=== Neighbouring villages ===
The outlying areas of the following villages are bordering the municipality of Arnhem directly, which means among others that in many a case a considerable number of their inhabitants originate from Arnhem.

{{div col}}
* [[Velp, Gelderland|Velp]]
* [[Oosterbeek]]
* [[Driel]]
* [[Elst, Gelderland|Elst]]
* [[Huissen]]
* [[Wolfheze]]
* [[Rozendaal]]
* [[Westervoort]]
{{div col end}}

=== Proximity of border with Germany ===

The city lies approximately 15 kilometers from the border with [[Germany]], and to some extent the westernmost villages in the municipality of [[Elten]], [[Germany]], function as dormitories for people who work in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] city of Arnhem in part due to the immigration of Dutch people from the region that were attracted by the lower house pricing just across the border.

=== Climate ===

Arnhem features the same climate (Cfb, oceanic climate) as all of the Netherlands; however, its location on the foothills of the Veluwe, the largest forest in the Netherlands, contributes to some higher precipitation values.

[[File:Arnhem, straatzicht de Vijzelstraat voor Giro d'Italia positie2 foto5 2016-04-17 19.13.jpg|thumb|City centre]]
The ''[[St Eusebius' Church, Arnhem|Grote Kerk]]'' (St. Eusebius' Church), built 1452–1560, lost most of its tower during World War II, of which a part has been reconstructed to a modern design and opened in 1964. Officially the tower is not part of the church and is owned by the municipality.

The house of Maarten van Rossum, a general serving Duke Charles van Gelre, has been the town hall since 1830: The [[satyr]]s in its [[Renaissance]] ornamentation earned it the name ''Duivelshuis'' (devil's house). The [[Netherlands Open Air Museum]] is located outside the city. It includes antique houses, farms, factories, and [[windmill]]s from different parts of the Netherlands. Two other windmills stand in Arnhem itself, [[De Hoop, Arnhem|De Hoop]] and [[De Kroon, Arnhem|De Kroon]].

The [[Royal Burgers' Zoo]] in Arnhem is one of the biggest and most-visited zoos in the Netherlands, featuring an underwater walkthrough, desert, mangrove, and rainforest. The [[GelreDome]], the home of [[Vitesse Arnhem]], the city's [[Eredivisie]] team in [[football (soccer)|football]], is a unique facility that features a retractable roof and a slide-out grass pitch. The concept has been fully duplicated since then by the [[Veltins-Arena]] in [[Gelsenkirchen]], Germany, and [[State Farm Stadium]] in [[Glendale, Arizona]], U.S., and partially by the [[Sapporo Dome]] in Japan (which has a sliding pitch but a fixed roof).

The [[KEMA Toren]] (formerly known as ''SEP Control Tower'') is the highest structure of the town. It is a 140-m-high TV tower.

The [[National Sports Centre Papendal]] is the national sports development centre of the [[Netherlands]], located in Arnhem. The first event held at Papendal was the [[1980 Summer Paralympics]], from 21 June to 5 July. However the site was formally adopted and developed from 1993, after the merger of the Dutch National Olympic Committee (NOC) and the Nederlandse Sport Federatie (NSF).

[[NOC*NSF]] have 90 affiliated national sports organizations, representing about 2700 individual sports clubs.<ref name=About>{{cite web|publisher=NOC*NSF|title=Over ons (About us)|language=nl|url=http://www.nocnsf.nl/over-nocnsf/|access-date=4 December 2010}}</ref> Papendal is also the training location of [[Association football|football]] club [[Vitesse Arnhem]], and the club's youth development system. Supporting facilities include a conference centre and hotel.

In preparation for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], in 2011 the facility built a replica of the proposed [[BMX racing]] track at the [[London Velopark]] venue.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/olliewilliams/2011/03/building_a_london_2012_venue_-.shtml|title=Building a London 2012 venue - in a Dutch forest|author=Ollie Williams|work=BBC Sport|date=25 March 2011|access-date=25 March 2011}}</ref> The track will host the second event on the 2011 [[UCI BMX World Championships]], on 27 and 28 May 2011.

Since January 2013 Sports Centre Papendal officially split from NOC * NSF and thus as organization demerges. This split offers Sports Centre Papendal many commercial benefits. There are facilities for various sports, including athletics, cycling and more.

Sport in the city is principally focussed on its association football club [[Vitesse Arnhem]] and its stadium the [[GelreDome]] built for the [[UEFA Euro 2000]]. The club has enjoyed some success in the [[Eredivisie]] and has featured in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] competition. Their best result in the [[Eredivisie]] was third place in 1997[[2014–15 KNVB Cup|–]]98. The club won the [[KNVB Cup]] in [[2016–17 KNVB Cup|2016–17]].

[[Introdans]] is a dance company based in the city of Arnhem. In 2009 the [[Ministry of Education, Culture and Science]] designated Introdans part of the basic national infrastructure. In 2016 was the [[2016 Giro d'Italia|Giro d'Italia]] in Arnhem.
