==History==
{{Main|History of Oaxaca}}

===Name===
The name of the state comes from the name of its capital city, Oaxaca. This name comes from the [[Nahuatl]] word "Huaxyacac",<ref name="consular">{{cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2815-oaxaca |title=Oaxaca |first=Gaceta |last=Consular |date=October 1996 |publisher=MexConnect |access-date=August 15, 2010}}</ref> which refers to a tree called a "guaje" (''[[Leucaena leucocephala]]'') found around the capital city. The name was originally applied to the [[Valley of Oaxaca]] by Nahuatl-speaking Aztecs and passed on to the Spanish during the conquest of the Oaxaca region. The modern state was created in 1824, and the state seal was designed by Alfredo Canseco Feraud and approved by the government of Eduardo Vasconcelos.<ref name="nomenclatura">{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/ |title=Nomenclatura |year=2009 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Estado de Oaxaca |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Nomenclature |access-date=August 15, 2010 |archive-date=January 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110091824/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/ |url-status=dead}}</ref> "Huaxyacac" {{IPA|[waːʃ.ˈja.kak]}} was transliterated as "Oaxaca" using Medieval Spanish orthography, in which the ''x'' represented the [[voiceless postalveolar fricative]] ({{IPA|[ʃ]}}, the equivalent of English ''sh'' in "shop"), making "Oaxaca" pronounced as {{IPA|[waˈʃaka]}}. But during the 16th century the voiceless fricative sound evolved into a [[voiceless velar fricative]] ({{IPA|[x]}}, like the ''ch'' in Scottish "loch"), and ''Oaxaca'' began to be pronounced {{IPA|es|waˈxaka|}}. In present-day Spanish, ''Oaxaca'' is pronounced {{IPA|es|waˈxaka|}} or {{IPA|[waˈhaka]}}, the latter pronunciation used mostly in dialects of southern Mexico, the Caribbean, much of Central America, some places in South America, and the Canary Islands and western Andalusia in Spain, where {{IPA|[x]}} has become a [[voiceless glottal fricative]] ({{IPA|[h]}}).<ref>{{cite book |last=Canfield |first=D.

===Prehistoric and pre-Hispanic period===
[[File:WLA lacma Effigy Head Brazier Zapotec.jpg|thumb|left|[[Effigy]] Head Brazier (500 BC – 200 BC)]]
Most of what is known about prehistoric Oaxaca comes from work in the Central Valleys region. Evidence of human habitation dating to about 11,000 years BCE has been found in the [[Guilá Naquitz cave]] near the town of [[San Pablo Villa de Mitla|Mitla]]. This area was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2010 in recognition of the "earliest known evidence of domesticated plants in the continent, while corn cob fragments from the same cave are said to be the earliest documented evidence for the domestication of maize." More finds of nomadic peoples date to about 5000 BCE, with some evidence of the beginning of agriculture. By 2000 BCE, agriculture had been established in the Central Valleys region of the state, with sedentary villages.<ref name="enchistoria">{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/ |title=Historia |year=2009 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Estado de Oaxaca |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=History |access-date=August 15, 2010 |archive-date=January 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110091824/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/ |url-status=dead}}</ref> The diet developed around this time remained until the Spanish Conquest, consisting primarily of harvested corn, beans, chocolate, tomatoes, chili peppers, squash and gourds. Meat was generally hunted and included [[paca|tepescuintle]], turkey, deer, [[peccary]], [[armadillo]] and [[iguana]].<ref name="1schmal"/>

The oldest known major settlements, such as [[Santo Domingo Yanhuitlán|Yanhuitlán]] and [[Laguna Zope]], are also in this area. The latter settlement is known for its small figures called "pretty women" or "baby face." Between 1200 and 900 BCE, pottery was produced in the area. This pottery has been linked with similar work done in [[La Victoria, Guatemala]]. Other important settlements from the same period include [[Tierras Largas]], [[San José Mogote]] and [[Guadalupe Etla|Guadalupe]], whose ceramics show [[Olmec]] influence.<ref name="enchistoria"/> The major native language family, [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]], is thought to have been spoken in northern Oaxaca around 4400 BCE and to have evolved into nine distinct branches by 1500 BCE.<ref name="1schmal"/>

Historic events in Oaxaca as far back as the 12th century are described in pictographic codices painted by Zapotecs and Mixtecs in the beginning of the colonial period, but outside of the information that can be obtained through their study, little historical information from pre-colonial Oaxaca exists, and our knowledge of this period relies largely on archaeological remains.<ref name="territorio"/> By 500 BCE, Oaxaca's central valleys were mostly inhabited by the Zapotecs, with the Mixtecs on the western side. These two groups were often in conflict during the pre-Hispanic period.<ref name="rincones3031">Akaike, pp. 30–31</ref> Archeological evidence indicates that between 750 and 1521, there may have been population peaks of as high as 2.5&nbsp;million.<ref name="territorio"/>

The Zapotecs were the earliest to gain dominance over the Central Valleys region.<ref name="1schmal"/> The first major dominion was centered in Monte Albán, which flourished from 500 BCE to AD 750.<ref name="territorio"/> At its height, Monte Albán was home to 25,000 people and the capital city of the Zapotec nation.<ref name="1schmal"/> It remained a secondary center of power for the Zapotecs until the Mixtecs overran it in 1325.<ref name="rincones3031"/> The site has several notable features, including the Danzantes, a set of stone reliefs, and the finding of fine quality ceramics.<ref name="enchistoria"/>
[[File:MonteAlban021.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|Looking southwest over the site of [[Monte Albán]]]]
Starting from AD 750 previous large urban centers such as Monte Alban fell across the Oaxaca area and smaller dominions grew and evolved until the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish Conquest]] in 1521.<ref name="territorio"/> Between 700 and 1300, the Mixtec were scattered among various dominions, including those of [[Achiutla]], [[Tequixtepec-Chazumba]], [[Apoala]] and [[Coixtlahuaca]]. The Zapotecs occupied a large region from Central Valleys region to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.<ref name="territorio"/> No major city-state like Monte Albán arose again, with villages and city-states remaining small, between 1,000 and 3,000 people with a palace, temple, market and residences. There were also some [[Mesoamerican ball court]]s. These and larger centers doubled as military fortresses in time of invasion. Important Zapotec and Mixtec sites include [[Yagul]], [[Zaachila]], [[Inguiteria]], [[Santo Domingo Yanhuitlán|Yanhuitlan]], [[Tamazulapan]], [[Tejupan]], and [[San Juan Teposcolula|Teposcolula]]. For nearly all this time, these various entities were at war with one another, and faced the threat of Aztec expansion.<ref name="territorio"/>

While the Zapotec remained dominant in many parts of the Central Valleys and into the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the Mixtec were pushing into Zapotec territory, taking Monte Alban. In areas they conquered, they became prolific builders, leaving behind numerous and still unexplored sites. But the conquest of the Central Valleys was never completed, with pressure coming from the Aztecs in Tenochtitlan in the 14th and 15th centuries. The Zapotecs and Mixtecs both allied themselves and fought among themselves as they tried to maintain their lands and valuable trade routes between the high central plains of Mexico and Central America.<ref 
name="1schmal"/><ref name="rincones3031"/>

The first Aztecs arrived in the Oaxaca area in 1250, but true expansion into the region began in the 15th century. In 1457, Moctezuma I invaded the Tlaxiaco and Coixtlahuaca areas, gaining control, demanding tribute and establishing military outposts.<ref name="territorio"/> These were Mixtec lands at first, pushing these people even further into Zapotec territory.<ref name="enchistoria"/> Under [[Axayacatl]] and [[Tizoc]], the Aztec began to take control of trade routes in the area and part of the Pacific Coast. By this time, the Zapotec were led by [[Cosijoeza]] with the government in Zaachila in the latter 15th century. Under [[Ahuitzotl]], the Aztecs temporarily pushed the Zapotecs into Tehuantepec and established a permanent military base at Huaxyacac (Oaxaca city). The Aztecs were stopped only by the Spanish Conquest.<ref name="enchistoria"/> The conquest changed most of the place names in parts of Oaxaca from their Nahuatl names.<ref name="territorio"/> In 1486 the Aztecs established a fort on the hill of Huaxyácac (now called El Fortín), overlooking the present city of Oaxaca. This was the major Aztec military base charged with the enforcement of tribute collection and control of trade routes.<ref name="1schmal"/>

Aztec rule in Oaxaca lasted only a little more than 30 years.<ref name="1schmal"/>

===Spanish colonization===
[[File:FrontOaxacaMainCathedral.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption, Oaxaca|Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption]], the motherchurch of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Antequera, Oaxaca|Oaxacan Archdiocese]]]]
Very soon after the fall of [[Tenochtitlan]] (Mexico City), Spaniards arrived in Oaxaca. [[Moctezuma II]] had informed [[Hernán Cortés|Hernando Cortes]] that the area had [[gold]]. In addition, when Zapotec leaders heard about the Spanish conquest of the [[Aztec Empire]], they sent an offer of an alliance.<ref name="1schmal"/> Several captains and representatives were sent to the area to explore, looking for gold and routes to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] to establish trade routes to [[spice trade|Asian spice markets]]. The most prominent of Cortés's captains to arrive here were [[Gonzalo de Sandoval]], [[Francisco de Orozco]] and [[Pedro de Alvarado]]. They overcame the main Aztec military stronghold only four months after the fall of Tenochtitlan.<ref name="enchistoria"/> Their reports about the area prompted Cortés to seek the title of the [[Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca]] from the [[Spanish Crown]].

The valley Zapotecs, the Mixtecs of the Upper Mixteca, the Mazatecas and the Cuicatecas, for the most part, chose not to fight the newcomers, instead negotiating to keep most of the old hierarchy but with ultimate authority to the Spanish.<ref name="enchistoria"/><ref name="1schmal"/> Resistance to the new order was sporadic and confined to the Pacific coastal plain, the Zapotec Sierra, the Mixea region and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The Mixe put up the most resistance to intrusions on their lands. They not only resisted during the first decade or so of Spanish occupation, like other groups, but through the rest of the 16th century. The last major Mixe rebellion came in 1570, when they burned and looted Zapotec communities and threatened to destroy the Spanish presidio of Villa Alta. This rebellion was put down by the Spanish, in alliance with about 2,000 Mixtecs and Aztecs. From this point, the Mixe retreated far into the mountains to isolate themselves, where they remain today.<ref name="1schmal"/>

The first priest in the territory was Juan Diaz, who accompanied Francisco de Orozco and built the first church in what is now the city of Oaxaca. He was followed by Bartolome de Olmade and others who began the superficial conversion of a number of indigenous people, including the baptism of Zapotec leader Cosijoeza. In 1528, the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] settled in the city of Oaxaca, forming the Bishopric of Oaxaca in 1535, and began to spread out from there, eventually reaching Tehuantepec and the coast. Other orders followed, such as the [[Jesuit]]s in 1596, the [[Mercedarians]] in 1601, and others in the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref name="enchistoria"/><ref name="1schmal"/>

Spanish conquest and subsequent colonization had a devastating effect on the native population, due to European diseases and forced labor. In some areas the native population nearly or completely disappeared.<ref name="territorio"/> It has been estimated that the native population of the region declined from 1.5&nbsp;million in 1520 to 150,000 in 1650.<ref name="1schmal"/> Eventually, this prompted the Spanish to import African slaves to some regions of the state, mostly in the [[Costa Region, Oaxaca|Costa Chica]]. This poor treatment of indigenous and African populations continued through the colonial period.<ref name="rincones31">Akaike, p. 31</ref> Initially, the Spanish did not change native power structures and allowed nobles to keep their privileges as long as they were loyal to the Spanish crown. But all indigenous people were eventually lumped into one category as the Spanish halted warfare among the city-states and created the official category of "indio" (Indian).<ref name="territorio"/>

Settlers arriving from Spain brought with them domestic animals that had never been seen in Oaxaca: [[horse]]s, [[cow]]s, [[goat]]s, [[sheep]], [[chicken]]s, [[mule]]s and [[oxen]].<ref name="1schmal"/> New crops such as [[sugar cane]], [[vanilla]] and [[tobacco]] were introduced.<ref name="territorio"/> Landholding remained mostly in indigenous hands, even though only 9% of Oaxaca's terrain is arable. Spanish officials and merchants tried to take indigenous privileges due to their social status, but this was resisted. While some of this was violent, the dominant response was to resort to the administrative-judicial system or yield. Violence was reserved for the worst of situations.<ref name="1schmal"/> One native product to reach economic importance during the colonial period was the [[cochineal]] insect, used for the making of dyes for textiles. This product was exported to Europe, especially in the 17th and 18th centuries. The use of this insect faded in the 19th century with the discovery of cheaper dyes including [[synthetic colorant]]s.<ref name="territorio"/>

For much of the colonial period, the state (then an ''intendencia'' or province) was relatively isolated with few roads and other forms of communication. Most politics and social issues were on the local level. Despite Spanish domination, the [[Nahuas|indigenous peoples of Oaxaca]] have maintained much of their culture and identity, more so than most other places in Mexico. Part of this is due to the geography of the land, making many communities isolated.<ref name="territorio"/>

===Independence===
[[File:BenitoJuarez.jpg|thumb|[[Benito Juárez]]]]
By 1810, the city of Oaxaca had 18,000 inhabitants, most of whom were [[mestizo]]s or mixed indigenous/European. During the [[Mexican War of Independence]] the government of this area remained loyal to the Spanish Crown. When representatives of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] came to meet with them, they were hanged and their heads left out in view. Some early rebel groups emerged in the state, such as those led by Felipe Tinoco and Catarino Palacios, but they were also eventually executed. After 1812, insurgents began to have some success in the state, especially in the areas around Huajuapan de León, where Valerio Trujano defended the city against royalist forces until [[José María Morelos y Pavón]] came in with support to keep the area in rebel hands. After that point, insurgents had greater success in various parts of the state, but the capital remained in royalist hands until the end of the war.<ref name="enchistoria"/>

The state was initially a department after the war ended in 1821, but after the fall of emperor [[Agustín de Iturbide]], it became a state in 1824, with Jose Maria Murguia as its first governor.<ref name="enchistoria"/>

During the 19th century, Oaxaca and the rest of Mexico was split between liberal (federalist) and conservative (centralist) factions. The political and military struggles between the factions resulted in wars and intrigues. [[Vicente Guerrero]], a liberal, was executed by firing squad in [[Cuilapan de Guerrero|Cuilapam]] in 1831. Liberal Manuel Gomez Pedraza became governor in 1832 but was opposed by General Estaban Moctezuma. He and commandant Luis Quintanar persecuted liberals in the state, including [[Benito Juárez]]. The constant warfare had a detrimental effect on the state's economy and those in the Tehuantepec area supported a separatist movement, which partially succeeded in the 1850s.<ref name="enchistoria"/>

Two Oaxacans, Juárez and [[Porfirio Díaz]], were prominent players in the [[Reform War]]. It is difficult to overstate Juárez's meaning to the state. He was born on March 21, 1806, in the village of [[San Pablo Guelatao]] and was full-blooded Zapotec. He studied to be a priest, then a lawyer.<ref name="1schmal"/><ref name="bjuarezgob">{{cite web |url=http://www.oaxaca.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=263&Itemid=108 |title=Benito Juárez |publisher=Government of Oaxaca |location=Oaxaca |language=es |access-date=August 15, 2010}}</ref> In 1847, Juárez became governor of Oaxaca, but still faced stern opposition from conservatives such as Lope San Germán. With the success of the [[Plan de Ayutla]], Juárez became governor again, and worked to remove privileges and properties from the Church and landed classes. The [[Constitution of 1857]] was ratified in Oaxaca city, and Juárez left the governor's position to become [[President of Mexico]].<ref name="enchistoria"/> He was president during one of Mexico's most turbulent times, fighting invading French forces and conservatives. As a liberal, he imposed many of the reforms that remain today, including those in education and separation of church and state. He is also considered a legend and a symbol for the indigenous population of the state.<ref name="1schmal"/>

Porfirio Díaz was Juárez's ally through the [[Second French intervention in Mexico|French Intervention]]. French imperial forces took Oaxaca city, which was defended by Díaz, landing him in prison. The capital was later recaptured by the liberals under Carlos Oronoz, but soon after Juárez took back the presidency, Díaz declared rebellion against him from Oaxaca in 1872 under the [[Plan de Tuxtepec]]. Juárez died in office. Díaz obtained the presidency and did not relinquish it until the [[Mexican Revolution]].<ref name="enchistoria"/>

===Late 19th century to present===
[[File:Oaxaca protests.jpg|thumb|Protesters in Oaxaca, 2006]]
During Díaz's rule, called the Porfiriato, a number of modernization efforts were undertaken in the state, such as public lighting, first with gas then with electricity, railroad lines, new agriculture techniques and the revitalization of commerce. Most of the benefits of these advances went to national and international corporations, and workers and indigenous farmers organized against the regime.<ref name="enchistoria"/>

After the Mexican Revolution broke out, Díaz was soon ousted and the rest of the war was among the various factions that had power in different parts of the country. Various leaders such as [[Francisco I. Madero]], [[Victoriano Huerta]] and [[Venustiano Carranza]] came to the state during this time, but the most important force in the area was the [[Liberation Army of the South]] under [[Emiliano Zapata]]. This army allied with and fought against the previous leaders, especially Venustiano Carranza,<ref name="enchistoria"/> and held various portions of the state until 1920.<ref name="1schmal"/> At the end of the Revolution, a new state constitution was written and accepted in 1922.<ref name="enchistoria"/>
[[File:Oaxaca 2010 Elections.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Workers campaigning in the historic 2010 state government election]]
A series of major disasters occurred in Oaxaca from the 1920s to the 1940s. In 1928, a series of earthquakes destroyed many of the buildings in the capital. A [[1931 Oaxaca earthquake|much larger earthquake in 1931]] was the largest in the state's history, devastating a number of cities along the coast. The 1930s brought the [[Great Depression]], which along with the disasters, prompted wide-scale migration to Mexico City. In 1944, torrential rains caused extensive flooding in the Tuxtepec region, resulting in hundreds of deaths.<ref name="rincones32">Akaike, p. 32</ref>

In the 1940s and 1950s, new infrastructure projects were begun. These included the Izúcar-Tehuantepec section of the [[Panamerican Highway]] and the construction of the Miguel Alemán Dam.<ref name="rincones32"/> From the 1980s to the present, there has been much development of the tourism industry in the state. This tourism, as well as the population growth of the capital, prompted the construction of the Oaxaca-Mexico City highway in 1994.<ref name="rincones33">Akaike, p. 33</ref> Development of tourism has been strongest in the Central Valleys area surrounding the capital, with secondary developments in [[Huatulco]] and other locations along the coast. This development was threatened by violence associated with the [[2006 Oaxaca protests|2006 uprising]], which severely curtailed the number of incoming tourists for several years.<ref name="turdes"/>

On February 12, 2008, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake was recorded in Oaxaca.<ref>{{cite news |title=Earthquake shakes southern Mexico |work=BBC News |date=February 12, 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7241234.stm |access-date=August 23, 2009}}</ref>

From the Mexican Revolution until the 2000s, the ruling PRI party controlled almost all Oaxacan politics, from the local to the state level.<ref name="PRIloses">{{Cite news |title=PRI loses Oaxaca, takes PAN states |url=http://thenews.com.mx/articulo/pri-loses-oaxacatakes-pan-states-1075 |publisher=The News |location=Mexico City |date=July 5, 2010 |access-date=August 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815050649/http://thenews.com.mx/articulo/pri-loses-oaxacatakes-pan-states-1075 |archive-date=August 15, 2010}}</ref> Challenges to the rule were sporadic and included the student movements of the 1970s, which did bring down the state government.<ref name="rincones3233">Akaike, pp. 32–33</ref> Teachers' strikes were frequent thereafter, culminating in the [[2006 Oaxaca protests|2006 uprising in Oaxaca city]], which brought in groups protesting the heavy marginalization of the poor.<ref name="turdes"/> The [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] lost its 80-year hold on the state government in 2010 with the election of the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN]] gubernatorial candidate [[Gabino Cué Monteagudo]].

In 2017, a series of [[earthquake]]s brought death and destruction to parts of Mexico, including Oaxaca. According to the [[US Geological Survey]], on September 23, 2017, a magnitude 6.1 earthquake shook [[Matías Romero, Oaxaca|Matías Romero]], about 275 miles southeast of [[Mexico City]]. The epicenter was about 12 miles from Matías Romero and approximately halfway between the two even more violent earthquakes in Mexico earlier that month, of which it is considered an [[aftershock]]. On September 8, an 8.1 magnitude quake struck off of the southern Pacific coast, near [[Chiapas]] state. [[Mexico City]], on September 19, then endured a 7.1 magnitude quake, which also marked the 32nd anniversary of the devastating [[1985 Mexico City earthquake|1985 earthquake]], in which more than 10,000 people were killed.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/23/americas/mexico-oaxaca-earthquake/index.html Hanna, Jason] ''CNN'': "2 new quakes shake southern Mexico, already coping with disasters" September 24, 2017.

The mountains are mostly formed by the convergence of the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]], the [[Sierra Madre de Oaxaca]] and the [[Sierra Atravesada]] into what is called the Oaxaca Complex (Complejo Oaxaqueño). The Sierra Madre del Sur runs along the coast with an average width of {{convert|150|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} and a minimum height of {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|sp=us}} asl with peaks over {{convert|2500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} asl. In various regions the chain is locally known by other names, such as the Sierra de Miahuatlán and the Sierra de la Garza. The Sierra Madre de Oaxaca enters the state from the Puebla and Veracruz borders in the [[Tuxtepec District, Oaxaca|Tuxtepec region]], running northwest to southeast towards the [[Valles Centrales de Oaxaca|Central Valleys region]], then onto the [[Tehuantepec District, Oaxaca|Tehuantepec area]]. Local names for parts of this range include Sierra de Tamazulapan, Sierra de Nochixtlan, Sierra de Huautla, Sierra de Juárez, Sierra de Ixtlan and others. Average altitude is {{convert|2500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} asl with peaks over {{convert|3000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} asl and width averages at about {{convert|75|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. The Sierra Atravesada is a prolongation of the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas]]. This range is not as high as the other two with an average elevation of just over {{convert|600|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. Most of it is located in the [[Juchitán District, Oaxaca|Juchitán district]] running east–west.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

The only valleys of any real size are the Central Valleys between [[Etla District, Oaxaca|Etla]] and [[Miahuatlán District, Oaxaca|Miahuatlán]], which contains the city of Oaxaca. Smaller populated valleys include Nochixtlan, Nejapa, Cuicatlan and Tuxtepec. Small mesas contain population centers such as [[Putla Villa de Guerrero|Putla]], [[Juxtlahuaca]], [[Santo Tomás Tamazulapan|Tamazulapan]], [[San Martín Zacatepec|Zacatepec]], [[Tlaxiaco]] and [[Huajuapan de León|Huajuapan]]. The largest canyons in the state are those in the [[Cuicatlán District|Cuicatlán area]] and include the Cortés, Galicia and María in the municipality of Tlaxiaco. There are a very large number of small canyons as well as ravines and arroyos of all sizes.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

The mountainous terrain allows for no navigable rivers; instead, there are a large number of smaller ones, which often change name from area to area. The continental divide passes through the state, meaning that there is drainage towards both the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean. Most of the drainage towards the Gulf is represented by the [[Papaloapan River|Papaloapan]] and [[Coatzacoalcos River]]s and their tributaries such as the Grande and Salado Rivers. Three rivers account for most of the water headed for the Pacific: the [[Mixteco River|Mixteco]], [[Atoyac River (Oaxaca)|Atoyac]] and [[Tehuantepec River]]s with their tributaries.<ref name="mediofisico"/> Other important rivers and streams include the Tequisistlán, Santo Domingo, Putla, Minas, Puxmetacán-Trinidad, La Arena, Cajonos, Tenango, Tonto, Huamelula, San Antonio, Ayutla, Joquila, Copalita, Calapa, Colotepec, Aguacatenango-Jaltepec, Los Perros, El Corte, Espíritu Santo, Sarabia, Ostuta, Petapa and Petlapa.<ref name="oaxgobter">{{cite web |url=http://www.oaxaca.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=section&id=17&Itemid=73 |title=Territorio |publisher=Government of Oaxaca |location=Oaxaca |language=es |trans-title=Territory |access-date=August 15, 2010}}</ref>

While the state is within the tropical latitudes, its climate varies with altitude.<ref name="mediofisico"/> There are three principal climate regions in the state. The first is the hot and subtropical lands. This accounts for about 30% of the state. The next is the semi hot and semi humid regions which account for about 18%, and temperate and semi humid at about 16%. All of these climates experience a rainy season in the summer and early fall.<ref name="oaxgobter"/> As most of the state is over {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]], average temperature is about {{convert|18|°C|°F|1}}, except near the coast. The coastline along with the regions of Yautepec, Putla, parts of Huahuapan and Silacayoapan are hot and relatively dry. Hot and humid climates predominate in Villa Alta, and the Central Valleys area and all others over {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level have a temperate climate. A few of the highest peaks, such as those in Tehuantepec and Putla have a cold climate. Precipitation varies from between {{convert|430|to|2700|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year. The Sierra Mazteca, Textepec and other areas near the Veracruz border have rains year round. The rest of the state receives the majority of its rain during the summer and early fall.

====Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Biosphere Reserve====
{{main|Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Biosphere Reserve}}
Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Biosphere Reserve, which encompasses the states of [[Puebla]] and Oaxaca in Mexico, was established as reserve in 1998 covering an area of {{convert|490187|ha|acre|abbr=on}}, with an altitudinal range of {{convert|600|to|2950|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. It is in the valley of the Tehuacán-Cuicatlán-Quiotepec. The six rivers which flow through the reserve are the Tomellín, Chiquito, Las Vueltas, Salado, Zapotitán and Río Grande of the Papaloapan watershed, which finally flow into the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. On account of wide variation in topography and annual rainfall, the micro-climatic conditions in the reserve has created a biosphere reserve, which is very rich in flora and fauna. The rich biodiversity of the preserve consists of 910 plant genus, 2,700 vascular species, 102 species of mammals, 356 species of birds which includes the endangered Green [[Macaw]] (''[[Ara militaris]]''), and 53 species of reptiles. However, the reserve is faced with threats from poaching, deforestation, overgrazing, and trash scattered on the highways and secondary roads that pass close and through the reserve. Inadequate patrolling staff is an issue which needs to be addressed to remove the threats to the biosphere reserve.<ref name=Biosphere>{{cite web |url=http://www.parkswatch.org/parkprofiles/pdf/tcbr_eng.pdf |title=Mexico: Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Biosphere Reserve |access-date=September 11, 2010 |publisher=Parks watch Org.}}</ref>

{{Main|Demographics of Oaxaca| Indigenous people of Oaxaca}}

===Overview===
The state has a total population of about 3.5&nbsp;million, with women outnumbering men by 150,000 and about 60% of the population under the age of 30. It is ranked tenth in population in the country. Fifty three percent of the population lives in rural areas.<ref name="habitantes">{{cite web |url=http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/oax/poblacion/default.aspx?tema=me&e=20 |title=Número de habitantes |publisher=[[INEGI]] |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Number of inhabitants |access-date=August 15, 2010}}</ref> Most of the state's population growth took place between 1980 and 1990. Life expectancy is 71.7 for men and 77.4 for women, just under the national average. Births far outpace deaths. In 2007, there were 122,579 births and 19,439 deaths.<ref name="dinamica">{{cite web |url=http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/oax/poblacion/educacion.aspx?tema=me&e=20 |title=Dinámica |publisher=[[INEGI]] |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Dynamics |access-date=August 15, 2010}}</ref> Approximately 85% profess the Catholic faith.<ref name="diversidad">{{cite web |url=http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/oax/poblacion/diversidad.aspx?tema=me&e=20 |title=Diversidad |publisher=[[INEGI]] |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=diversity |access-date=August 15, 2010}}</ref>

===Indigenous peoples===
Demographically, Oaxaca stands out due to the high percentage of indigenous peoples.<ref name="WWF"/><ref name="rincones22">Akaike, p. 22</ref> It is estimated that at least a third are speakers of indigenous languages (with 50% not able to speak Spanish), accounting for 53% of Mexico's total indigenous language speaking population.<ref name="diversidad"/><ref name="WWF"/> The state straddles two Mesoamerican cultural areas. The first extends into the state from the [[Mayan peoples|Mayan]] lands of Chiapas, [[Yucatán]], and [[Guatemala]]. The central and northwest of the state is part of the cultures of the [[Valley of Mexico]], with historical influence seen from ancient cities such as [[Teotihuacan]], [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]], and [[Tenochtitlan]].<ref name="territorio">{{Cite journal |last=Ardóñez |first=Maria de Jesús |date=January 10, 2000 |title=El territorio del estado de Oaxaca: una revisión histórica |trans-title=The territory of the state of Oaxaca: A historical review |journal=Investigaciones Geográficas, Boietin del Instituto de Geografia |volume=42 |pages=67–86 |publisher=[[UNAM]] |location=Mexico |url=http://www.igeograf.unam.mx/instituto/publicaciones/boletin/bol42/b42art5.pdf |language=es |access-date=August 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214140105/http://www.igeograf.unam.mx/instituto/publicaciones/boletin/bol42/b42art5.pdf |archive-date=December 14, 2010}}</ref>

The main reason that indigenous languages and cultures have been able to survive here is the rugged terrain, which isolate communities.<ref name="1schmal"/><ref name="lonelyplanet "/> This also has the effect of dividing the state into small secluded communities, which have developed independently over time. There are 16 ethno linguistic groups recognized by the [[Instituto Nacional Indigenista]]<ref name="perfilsoc">{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/ |title=Perfil Sociodemografico |year=2009 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Estado de Oaxaca |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Socio-demographic profile |access-date=August 15, 2010 |archive-date=January 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110091824/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/ |url-status=dead}}</ref> who maintain their individual languages, customs and traditions well into the colonial period and to some extent to the present day.<ref name="1schmal"/> However, some studies put the number of cultures in the state as high as 4,000.<ref name="territorio"/> This makes Oaxaca the most ethnically complex of Mexico's 31 states.<ref name="1schmal"/>

The most populous indigenous groups in Oaxaca are the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] or [[Mixtec]]. Several other languages of the [[Oto-Manguean languages]] are spoken in Oaxaca: The [[Trique language|Triques]], [[Amuzgo people|Amuzgos]], and [[Cuicatecs|Cuicatec]]s are linguistically most closely related to the Mixtecs, The languages of the [[Chocho people|Chocho]], [[Popoloca]] and [[Ixcatecos|Ixcatec]] peoples are most closely related to that of the [[Mazatec people|Mazatecs]]. The [[Chatino language]]s are grouped with the [[Zapotecan languages|Zapotecan]] branch of Oto-Manguean. The languages of the [[Zoque people|Zoque]] and [[Mixe people]]s belong to the [[Mixe–Zoquean languages]]. Other ethnic groups include the [[Oaxaca Chontal people#Chontal|Chontalees]], [[Chinantec]]s, the [[Huave people|Huaves]], and [[Nahua people|Nahuas]].<ref name="mosaico">{{cite web |url=http://www.oaxaca.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=239&Itemid=105 |title=Mosaico Étnico |publisher=Government of Oaxaca |location=Oaxaca |language=es |access-date=August 15, 2010}}</ref> As of 2005, a total of 1,091,502 people were counted as speaking an indigenous language.<ref name="perfilsoc"/>

====Zapotecs====
The largest indigenous group in the state are the Zapotecs at about 350,000 people or about 31% of the total indigenous population.<ref name="1schmal"/><ref name="diversidad"/><ref name="perfilsoc"/> The Zapotec have an extremely long history in the Central Valleys region and unlike other indigenous groups, do not have a migration story. For them, they have always been here. Zapotecs have always called themselves Be'ena'a, which means The Cloud People. Zapotec territory extends in and around the Central Valleys region of the state, around the capital city of Oaxaca. The Zapotec language has historically been and is still the most widely spoken in the state, with four dialects that correspond to the four subdivisions of these people: Central Valleys and Isthmus, the Sierra de Ixtlan, Villa Alta and Coapan.<ref name="rincones22"/> Zapotec communities can be found in 67 municipalities. The various Zapotec dialects account for 64 of the total 173 still surviving forms of [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]].<ref name="1schmal"/>

====Mixtecs====
[[File:MixDressRMH.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[wax sculpture|Wax mannequin]] of woman in Mixtec dress]]
The second largest group are the Mixtecs at just over 240,000 people or 27% of the indigenous population.<ref name="diversidad"/><ref name="perfilsoc"/> These people established themselves in the northwest of Oaxaca and far southern Puebla over 3,000 years ago, making them one of the oldest communities in the region. These same people put pressure on the Zapotec kingdoms until the Spanish conquered both peoples in the 16th century.<ref name="rincones22"/> Mixtec territory is divided into three sub regions. The Mixteca Alta (Upper Mexteca) covers 38 municipalities and is the most populated region. The Mixteca Baja (Lower Mixteca) includes 31 municipalities. The Coastal Mixtecs are a small group. Today, the Mixtecs call themselves Ñuu Savi, the people of the rain. The [[Mixtecan languages|Mixtecan language family]], as one of the largest and most diverse families in the Oto-Manguean group, includes three groups of languages: Mixtec, [[Cuicatec language|Cuicatec]], and [[Trique language|Trique]].<ref name="1schmal"/>

====Mazatecos====
The [[Mazateco]]s number at about 165,000 or 15% of Oaxaca's indigenous population.<ref name="diversidad"/> (perfil soc) These people occupy the northernmost area of the state, in the upper [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] mountains and the Papaloapan Basin. The Mazatecos call themselves Ha shuta enima, which means People of Custom. Some historians believe that the Mazatecos descend from the [[Chichimeca|Nonoalca-Chichimecas]], who migrated south from Tula early in the 12th century. While most live in Oaxaca, a significant number of Mazatecos also occupy Veracruz and Puebla.<ref name="1schmal"/>
[[File:Mujerpopoloca.jpg|thumb|right|Popoloca woman]]
The [[Chinanteco]]s account for about 10% of Oaxaca's indigenous people, numbering at about 104,000.<ref name="perfilsoc"/><ref name="latinola">{{cite web |url=http://www.latinola.com/story.php?story=3908 |title=Oaxaca: Land of Diversity |author=Schmal, John P. |date=January 28, 2007 |access-date=January 1, 2008 |archive-date=January 22, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122054416/http://www.latinola.com/story.php?story=3908 |url-status=dead}}</ref> They inhabit the Chinantla region of north central Oaxaca near the border of Veracruz. The Chinanteco language has as many as 14 different dialects and is part of the Oto-Manguean linguistic group. Historians believe that those living in this region struggled to maintain their independence against sudden and numerous attacks by the Zapotecs, Mixtecs, Mixes and Aztecs. The latter, led by [[Moctezuma I]], finally conquered the Chinantla region during the 15th century.<ref name="1schmal"/><ref name="latinola"/>

====Mixe====
The [[Mixe people]] account for another 10% of the indigenous population at just over 103,000 people.<ref name="diversidad"/><ref name="perfilsoc"/> The Mixe are an isolated group in the northeastern part of the state, close to the border of Veracruz. Their region includes 19 municipalities and 108 communities. The Mixes call themselves Ayuuk, which means The People. It is unknown where the Mixe migrated from, with some speculating from as far as [[Peru]], but they arrived in waves from 1300 to 1533. They came into conflict with the Mixtecs and Zapotecs, but allied themselves with the Zapotecs against the Aztecs, then resisted the Spanish. The Mixe language has seven dialects and this group has the highest rate of monolingualism (36% of speakers in the year 2000) of any Indigenous group in Mexico.<ref name="1schmal"/>

====Other====
Minorities include the [[Chatinos|Chatino]] (42,477),<ref name="1schmal"/> the [[Trique people|Trique]] (18,292),<ref name="latinola"/> the [[Huave people]] (15,324),<ref name="latinola"/> the [[Cuicatecs|Cuicatecos]] (12,128),<ref name="latinola"/> the [[Zoque people|Zoque]], also called the Aiyuuk (roughly 10,000), the [[Amuzgo]]s (4,819),<ref name="latinola"/> the [[Oaxaca Chontal people#Chontal|Chontales of Oaxaca]] (4,610), the [[Tacuate people|Tacuates]] (1,725),<ref name="latinola"/> the [[Chocholtec|Chocho or Chocholtec]] (524), the [[Ixcatecos]] (207),<ref name="latinola"/> the [[Popoloca]]s (61)<ref name="latinola"/> and a small population of Nahuatl speaking peoples in the border area with Puebla.<ref name="rincones22"/>

===Afro-Mexicans===
According to the 2020 Census, 4.71% of Oaxaca's population identified as Black, [[Afro-Mexican]], or of African descent, which is the second highest percentage of any Mexican state.<ref>{{cite web |author=Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI) |url=https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/ccpv/2020/tableros/panorama/ |title=Panorama |website=Inegi.org.mx |date= |access-date=2022-02-17}}</ref>

Ritualistitic and shamanic religious practices were prevalent in Oaxaca valley, until the Spanish invaded the valley in 1521. Proselytism was also started in 1521, Christianity was ushered into the valley and eventually took firm roots.<ref name=ritual>{{cite web |url=http://www.oaxacaoaxaca.com/archeology-oaxaca.htm |title=7,000 Years of Religious Ritual |access-date=September 12, 2010 |publisher=Oaxaca Travel site}}</ref><ref name=library>{{cite web |url=http://www2.brandonu.ca/Library/cjns/7.2/starr.pdf |title=Zapotec Religious Practices in the Valley Of Oaxaca: An Analysis of the 1580 "Relaciones Geograficas" of Philip Ii |access-date=September 12, 2010 |author=Jean Starr |publisher=Canadian Journal of Native Studies |volume=7 |issue=2 |year=1987 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706170107/http://www2.brandonu.ca/Library/cjns/7.2/starr.pdf |archive-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref>

The ancient religious practices have been dated by archaeological findings (over a 15 years period of excavations by two Archaeologists of the [[University of Michigan]]) to be more than 7000 years old. Initially, 7000 years ago, the people were "hunters and gatherers with no fixed abode".{{attribution needed|date=August 2018}}<ref name=ritual/><ref name=library/> With development of agricultural practices, with maize as the main crop and settled villages getting established over several centuries, a warrior type of societal culture evolved by 500 BC, with the Zapotec state getting into shape. Concurrently, ceremonious religious practices with ritualistic and shamanistic dancing around stone marked floors came to be observed (a pre-Zapotec dance floor dated to 6650 BC testifies this). Even cannibalistic practices were noted. The ritualistic practices were formalized, as permanent settlements were established, and temples were built to perform the rituals as per a set of calendar annual events. There were two interconnected calendars prevalent at the time- one of 260 days and another of 365 days, which synchronized every 52 years. In subsequent years, as upper strata of society (an "elite class") came into existence, the religious practices and the temple got more formalized with priests controlling the community's religion. Religion started to evolve around the ritualistic practices but with more defined role of religion under the monarchic rule which came into effect along with "the religious systems that were the previous source of social authority". Monte Alban was founded around 500 BCE. It is inferred that from 1500 BC, Zapotec society evolved as an organized "autonomous ascribed-status peasant societies". The ritual buildings in the valley dated to this period testify this observation.<ref name=ritual/><ref name=library/> Richard Sosis, an [[anthropologist]] at the [[University of Connecticut]] has summarised the archaeological findings with the observation:<ref name=ritual/>
<blockquote>
the Michigan archaeologists' study delineated the process of religion adapting to different environments as Oaxacan society changed. Among foragers, ritual serves to cement solidarity, he said, and the "powerful moralistic gods that we associate with contemporary religions" are a later development, introduced at the stage when priests have acquired control of a religion and "are effectively controlling the masses through ritual activities that instill the fear of supernatural punishment.
</blockquote>

When Christianity made inroads into the Valley in 1521, the valley was part of the [[Aztec]] tribute empire with [[Tenochtitlan]] as the capital (present day Mexico City) and Spanish settlements came into existence to exploit the rich land and mineral resources of the valley. The first record of [[Baptism]] in the valley was that of the [[King of Teozapotlan]], the most important Valley ruler, in 1521. He was baptized as [[Don Juan Cortes]]. Nobles, who converted to Christianity, were permitted to keep their traditional rights under a 1557 order by [[Philip II of Spain]]. Spaniards pursued proselytisation activity with dedicated single-minded devotion throughout the 18th century with the "goal of saving the souls of their subjects".<ref name=ritual/>

==Government and political geography==
[[File:Oaxaca en Oaxaca.svg|thumb|Map marking the numerous municipalities of Oaxaca. Oaxaca de Juárez is highlighted.]]

The state was created by a federal decree in 1824, and is the fifth largest state in Mexico.<ref name="territorio"/> The state government consists of an executive branch, headed by the governor, a [[unicameral]] legislature and a judiciary branch headed by a state supreme court presided over by seven judges.<ref name="encgobierno">{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/ |title=Gobierno |year=2009 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Estado de Oaxaca |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Government |access-date=August 15, 2010 |archive-date=January 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110091824/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/ |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The area of Oaxaca has been divided into small entities since far back into the pre-Hispanic period. Much of the reason for this is the highly mountainous geography, although the occupation of the area by numerous ethnicities is a factor as well. The area resisted large scale Spanish domination through the colonial era, and maintained local traditions and customs better than other areas of Mexico. Even today, the state has far more [[municipalities of Mexico|municipalities]] and semi autonomous local authorities than any other state in the nation.<ref name="territorio"/> Oaxaca is divided into 570 municipalities, about one-quarter of the total of the country.<ref name="1schmal"/> Many of the municipalities of the state had been ill-defined from colonial times until the 1990 INEGI survey which delineated them with exact coordinates.<ref name="territorio"/> The most populated municipality is the capital, followed by [[San Juan Bautista Tuxtepec]] and [[Juchitán de Zaragoza]].<ref name="destribucion">{{cite web |url=http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/oax/poblacion/distribucion.aspx?tema=me&e=20 |title=Distribución |publisher=[[INEGI]] |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Distribution |access-date=August 15, 2010}}</ref> There is also a system of thirty districts to group municipalities.<ref name="territorio"/><ref name="lasocho">{{cite web |url=http://www.oaxaca.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=229&Itemid=94 |title=Las Ocho Regiones Geográficas |publisher=Government of Oaxaca |location=Oaxaca |language=es |access-date=August 15, 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Oaxaca State Palace.jpg|thumb|left|Interior view of the old Oaxaca Government Palace and Capitol Building, which now houses the state museum]]
The state has traditionally been divided into seven regions, which took into account variables such as ethnic makeup, economics and geography. Today, the state is divided into eight regions called Valles Centrales, La Cañada, La Mixteca, Sierra Madre del Sur, Sierra Norte, El Istmo, La Costa and El Golfo. These still take into account the traditional variables, but geography plays a larger role.<ref name="lasocho"/> La Cañada Region comprises the fourth and fifth districts with a total of 45 municipalities. The Coast Region consists of the 21st, 22nd and 30th districts with a total of 50 municipalities; the Isthmus Region consists of the 28th and 29th districts with a total of 41 municipalities; the Mixteca Region consists of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 8th, 9th, 10th and 16th districts with a total of 155 municipalities; the Papaloapam Region consists of the 6th and 7th districts with a total of 20 municipalities; the Sierra Sur Region consists of the 15th, 23rd, 26th and 27th districts with 70 municipalities; the Sierra North Region consists of the 12th, 13th and 14th districts with 69 municipalities; the Central Valleys Regions consists of the 11th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th, 24th and 25th districts with 121 municipalities.<ref name="regionalizacion">{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/ |title=Regionalización |year=2009 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Estado de Oaxaca |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Regions |access-date=August 15, 2010 |archive-date=January 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110091824/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/ |url-status=dead}}</ref>

According to the Mexican government agency [[Conapo]] (National Population Council), Oaxaca is the third most economically marginalized state in Mexico.<ref name="turdes"/><ref name="pobreza ">{{Cite journal |last=Alvarado Juárez |first=Ana Margarita |title=Migración y pobreza en Oaxaca |trans-title=Migration and poverty in Oaxaca |journal=El Cotidiario, Revista de la Realidad Mexicana Actual |url=http://www.elcotidianoenlinea.com.mx/pdf/14808.pdf |language=es |access-date=August 15, 2010 |archive-date=July 22, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722223200/http://www.elcotidianoenlinea.com.mx/pdf/14808.pdf |url-status=dead}}</ref> The state has 3.3% of the population but produces only 1.5% of the GNP.<ref name="standardpoors ">{{cite web |url=http://www2.standardandpoors.com/portal/site/sp/es/la/page.article/2,1,7,0,1069424853819.html |title=Fundamento: Estado de Oaxaca, México |publisher=Standard & Poor's |language=es |trans-title=Fundamentals:State of Oaxaca, Mexico |access-date=August 15, 2010}}</ref> The main reason for this is the lack of infrastructure and education, especially in the interior of the state outside of the capital. Eighty percent of the state's municipalities do not meet federal minimums for housing and education. Most development projects are planned for the capital and the surrounding area. Little has been planned for the very rural areas and the state lacks the resources to implement them.<ref name="pobreza "/> The largest sector of Oaxaca's economy is agriculture, mostly done communally in [[ejido]]s or similar arrangements. About 31% of the population is employed in agriculture, about 50% in commerce and services and 22% in industry.<ref name="oaxgobter"/> The commerce sector dominates the gross domestic product at 65.4%, followed by industry/mining at 18.9% and agriculture at 15.7%.<ref name="actecon">{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/ |title=Actividad Econónica |year=2009 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Estado de Oaxaca |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Economic activity |access-date=August 15, 2010 |archive-date=January 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110091824/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/ |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Migration===
In 45.5% of Oaxaca's municipalities, the population has declined due to migration. Poverty and migration are caused mostly by the lack of economic development in the state, which leaves most of the population working in the least productive sector. This has led to wide scale migration, mostly from the rural areas, to find employment. Within Oaxaca, many people leave rural villages to work in the city of Oaxaca, the Papaloapan area and the coast. Within Mexico, many leave for Mexico City, [[Mexico State]], [[Sinaloa]], [[Baja California]] and [[Baja California Sur]]. Most of those leaving the state are agricultural workers. As of 2005, over 80,000 people from Oaxaca state live in some other part of Mexico.<ref name="pobreza "/><ref name="movimientos">{{cite web |url=http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/oax/poblacion/m_migratorios.aspx?tema=me&e=20 |title=Movimientos migratorios |publisher=[[INEGI]] |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Migratory movements |access-date=August 15, 2010}}</ref> Most of those leaving Oaxaca and Mexico go to the United States. Much of the current wave of emigration began in the late 1970s, and by the 1980s Oaxaca ranked 8th in the number of people leaving for the US from Mexico. Today, that percentage has fallen to 20th. Most of those migrate to the United States, concentrated in California and Illinois.<ref name="pobreza "/> In 2007, estimates of the number of Oaxacans residing in [[Los Angeles]], California ranged from 50,000 to 250,000.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sounds in Oaxacalifornia: Gala Porras-Kim Investigates Indigenous Tones, 18th Street Arts Center |work=Artbound – KCET – Los Angeles |access-date=2012-08-07 |date=2012-07-31 |url=http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/counties/los-angeles/sounds-in-oaxacalifornia-gala-porras-kim-investigates-indigenous-tones.html}}</ref>

===Agriculture===
[[File:Mercado3 2008-10-31.JPG|thumb|right|A market in Oaxaca]]
The economy of Oaxaca is based on agriculture, especially in the interior of the state.<ref name="standardpoors "/> Only 9% of the territory is suitable for agriculture due to the mountainous terrain, so there are limits to this sector.<ref name="1schmal"/><ref name="pobreza "/> The production of food staples, such as corn and beans, is mostly for internal consumption but this production cannot meet demand.<ref name="pobreza "/> The total agricultural production of the state was estimated at 13.4&nbsp;million tons with a value of 10,528&nbsp;million pesos in 2007. As of 2000, 1,207,738 hectares are used for the raising of crops, most of which occurs during the annual rainy season, with only 487,963 having crops growing year round. Only 81,197 hectares have irrigation.<ref name="actecon"/> The variation of climate allows for a wider range of agricultural crops than would otherwise grow in a geographical region of this size.<ref name="mediofisico"/> Oaxaca is the nation's second highest producer of grains and [[agave]]. It is third in the production of peanuts, [[mango]] and sugar cane. It is the second largest producer of goat meat, providing about 10% of the national total.<ref name="oaxgobter"/> In the more temperate areas crops such as corn, beans, [[sorghum]], peanuts, [[alfalfa]] and wheat are grown. In more tropical areas, crops also include coffee, [[sesame seed]], rice, sugar cane and pineapple.<ref name="actecon"/>

Livestock is raised on 3,050,106 hectares or 32% of the state's land. Cattle dominate in the Tuxtepec, Isthmus and Coast regions, with pigs dominating in higher elevations such as the Central Valleys Region. Other animals include sheep, goats, domestic fowl and bees. The value of this production was estimated at 2,726.4&nbsp;million pesos with cattle comprising over half of this.<ref name="actecon"/> Coffee is grown in mountain areas near the Pacific Ocean in municipalities such as [[Santa María Huatulco]], [[Pluma Hidalgo]], [[Candelaria Loxicha]], [[San Miguel del Puerto]] and [[San Mateo Piñas]]. The growing of coffee here dates back to the 17th and 18th centuries when English pirates introduced the plant. Coastal fishing is also a major source of income and in 2007 the total fishing catch was estimated at 9,300 tons with a value of over 174&nbsp;million pesos.<ref name="actecon"/>

===Mining and industry===
Mining has traditionally been important to the economy and history. Hernán Cortés sought and received the title of the Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca in order to claim mineral and other rights.<ref name="1schmal"/> Currently coal, salt, chalk, petroleum, marble, [[Agricultural lime|lime]], [[graphite]], [[titanium]], silver, gold and lead are still extracted.<ref name="mediofisico"/><ref name="actecon"/> Most mines today are located in Etla, [[Ixtán District, Oaxaca|Ixtlán]], [[San Pedro Taviche]], [[Pápalo]] and [[Salina Cruz]]. There is an oil and natural gas refinery in Salina Cruz, which provides products to the state and other areas on Mexico's Pacific coast.<ref name="actecon"/>

Tourism is important to the state as it is the only sector that is growing and brings substantial income from outside the state, although most tourism is concentrated in the capital and along the coast.<ref name="turdes"/><ref name="standardpoors "/> In 2007, there were 1,927 small grocery stores, 70 tianguis and 167 [[Traditional fixed markets in Mexico|municipal markets]]. Tourism accounts for about 30% of the commerce sector of Oaxaca's economy.<ref name="actecon"/> The state attracts visitors from Mexico and abroad.<ref name="turdes"/> The state government has been pushing this sector heavily as a means of growing the economy,<ref name="turdes"/> with major infrastructure projects such as the Oaxaca-Puerto Escondido-Huatulco highway (scheduled to finish in 2018) and the Iberdrola hydroelectric dam.<ref name="standardpoors "/>

In 2000, there were 612 hotels with 15,368 rooms. Thirteen of these were classed as five stars. The state received 1,564,936 visitors that year, over 80% of whom were from Mexico. The Central Valleys region receives the most visitors (60%), followed by the La Mixteca and Papaloapan regions (29%) and the coast (11%), in spite of the fact that only 7% of the state's attractions are in the Oaxaca city area.<ref name="actecon"/> One reason for this is that the city of Oaxaca is only four and a half hours away from Mexico City via the federal highway.<ref name="consular "/>

===Arts===
[[File:Jarabe Mixteco.jpg|thumb|Two young people dancing a [[jarabe]]]]
From the latter half of the 20th century, the state has produced a number of notable painters such as [[Rufino Tamayo]], [[Rodolfo Nieto]], [[Rodolfo Morales]], and [[Francisco Toledo]]. These four painters have been influential in the establishment of new movements of art from the state. These movements have spurred exhibitions, galleries, museums and schools such as the Museo de Arte Contemporaneo (MACO) and [[Graphic Arts Institute of Oaxaca|Instituto de Artes Gráficas de Oaxaca]] (IAGO).<ref name=goboax>{{cite web |url=http://www.oaxaca.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=241:francisco-toledo&catid=67:pintores-oaxaquenos&Itemid=106 |author=Gobierno del Estado de Oaxaca |title=Francisco Toledo |website=Oaxaca.gob.mx}}</ref> Many of today's artists from Oaxaca have been inspired by past indigenous paintings as well as the colonial era works of [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]].<ref name="rincones1215">Akaike, pp. 12–15</ref>

The state has not produced as many writers as painters but some important names include Adalberto Carriedo, Jacobo Dalevuelta, Andrés Henestrosa and Natalia Toledo.<ref name="rincones1519">Akaike, pp. 15–19</ref>

Music and dance are almost inextricably linked to the state's folkloric heritage. Even more modern composers such as Macedonio Alcalá, Samuel, Mondragón Noriega and José López Alavés are strongly influenced by traditional melodies. Traditional music and dance has its roots in the indigenous traditions that existed long before the Spanish arrived. To these traditions were added elements from European culture and Catholicism. The three main traditions to be found in the state are those of the Zapotecs and the Mixtecs, with a small but distinct community of [[Afro-Mexican]]s. Some of the best known dances include Los Diablos, La Tortuga, Las Mascaritas and Los Tejorones. In the Afro-Mexican Costa Chica region, a dance called Las Chilenas stands out. La Sandunga is a song that typifies the musical style of the Tehuantepec region and a musical style called "son bioxho" is an endemic form of the [[son (music)|son style]] played with drums, an empty tortoise shell and a reed flute.<ref name="rincones2022">Akaike, pp. 20–22</ref>

===Food and drink===

The popular bitter chocolate drink, traditionally served cold in special cups (xicali) with a variety of spices, was once a favorite beverage among the upper classes of Mesoamerican societies.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Ramos Cacciatore |first=Manuela |title=Oaxacanita Chocolate: Reviving Indigenous Mixtec cocoa traditions |url=https://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/ip-at-work/2023/oaxacanita-chocolate.html}}</ref> The [[cacao bean|cacao]] beans are ground then combined with sugar, almonds, cinnamon and other ingredients to form bars.

[[Oaxaca cheese]] is a soft white string cheese which is similar to mozzarella. It is sold in "ropes" which are wound onto themselves into balls. It is eaten cold or lightly melted on quesadillas and other dishes. One unique aspect to Oaxacan cuisine is the consumption of "chapulines", which are a type of grasshopper that has been fried and seasoned with salt, lime and chili pepper.<ref name="rincones45" />

There is a saying in Oaxaca, "Para todo mal, mezcal, para todo bien, también" (For everything bad, mezcal; for everything good, the same.) Alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks (as well as food items) based on the maguey plant have been consumed in many parts of Mexico since early in the pre-Hispanic period. The tradition of the making of the distilled liquor called mezcal has been a strong tradition in the Oaxacan highlands since the colonial period. One reason for this is the quality and varieties of maguey grown here. Some varieties, such as espadín and arroquense are cultivated but one variety called tobalá is still made with wild maguey plants. It is made with the heart of the plant which is roasted in pits (giving the final product a smokey flavor) and is sometimes flavored with a chicken or turkey breast (pechuga) added to the mash. It is mezcal, not [[tequila]], and may contain a "[[Maguey worm|worm]]", which is really a larva that infests maguey plants. The final distilled product can be served as is or can be flavored (called cremas) with almonds, coffee, cocoa fruits and other flavors.<ref name="rincones4445">Akaike, pp. 44–45</ref>

The town of [[Santiago Matatlán]] calls itself the world capital of mezcal. In many parts of the Central Valleys area, one can find small stands and stores selling locally made mezcal on roadsides.<ref name="turdes"/>

Most tourist attractions are located in the city of Oaxaca and the Central Valleys region that surrounds it. This area is the cultural, geographical and political center of the state, filled with pre-Hispanic ruins, [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] churches and monasteries, [[Traditional fixed markets in Mexico|indigenous markets]] and villages devoted to various crafts. The capital city, along with nearby Monte Albán together are listed as a [[World Heritage Site]].<ref name="turdes"/><ref name="lonelyplanet ">{{cite web |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/mexico/oaxaca-state |title=Oaxaca |publisher=Lonely Planet |access-date=August 15, 2010}}</ref> Many of the attractions in the city proper are located between the main square or Zocalo and along Andador Macedonio Alcalà Street, known as the Andador Turístico or Tourist Walkway. These include the [[Oaxaca cathedral|Cathedral]], the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Solitude|Basilica of Nuestra Señora de la Soledad]], [[Museum of Contemporary Art (Oaxaca)|Museum of Contemporary Art]] (MACO), [[Museo Rufino Tamayo, Oaxaca|Rufino Tamayo Museum]] and the [[Mercado 20 de Noviembre]], known for its food stands.<ref name="turdes"/> The most important annual festival is the [[Guelaguetza]], also called the Fiesta del Lunes del Cerro (Festival of Mondays at the Mountain) which occurs each July.<ref name="atraccul"/><ref name="secturgue ">{{cite web |url=http://www.aoaxaca.com/index.php?te=TE0002&ds=TE0028&st=TE0045&at=AT0119&pagina=1 |title=Guelaguetza |publisher=Secretaria de Turismo |location=Oaxaca |language=es |access-date=August 15, 2010}}</ref>

The largest and most important archeological site is [[Monte Albán]], which was capital of the Zapotec empire.<ref name="consular "/> Also important as an archaeological site is the ancient Zapotec center of [[Mitla]] at the eastern end of the Central Valleys which is noted for its unique ancient stone [[fretwork]] and abstract mosaics.<ref name="turdes"/><ref name="consular "/> Between Mitla and Monte Albán there are a number of other important archeological sites such as [[Yagul]], [[Dainzú]] and [[Lambityeco]]. The most important of these three is Lambityeco, in the middle of the Tlacolula Valley. It was occupied from 600 BCE to 800 CE and coincides with Monte Alban. It was important at that time for its production of salt.<ref name="turdes"/> Yagul is a ceremonial center on the side of a mountain. Features include a Mesoamerican ball court, the La Rana courtyard, a temple, palace and other buildings.<ref name="atraccul"/>

[[File:ZbeachLWest.JPG|thumb|View of Zipolite Beach]]
The second most important zone for tourism is the coast, especially from [[Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca|Puerto Escondido]] to [[Huatulco]], with sandy beaches on the Pacific Ocean, dolphins, sea turtles, and lagoons with water birds. Many beaches are nearly virgin with few visitors but several areas have been developed such as Puerto Escondido, Huatulco, [[Puerto Ángel]], [[Zipolite]], [[San Agustinillo]] and [[Mazunte]].<ref name="turdes"/><ref name="lonelyplanet "/> Puerto Escondido is an important destination for tourism from within Mexico with beaches such as Playa Carrizalillo and also attracts international surfers to Zicatela Beach, where an annual surfing competition is held.<ref name="turdes"/> There are also areas of Oaxaca that are promoted for ecotourism such as [[Lagunas de Chacahua National Park]] set in 14,267 hectares of lagoons, rivers, beaches, mangroves, rainforest and grasslands with some 136 species of birds, 23 of reptiles, 4 amphibians and twenty types of mammals.<ref name="turdes"/>

[[Yagul Natural Monument]], located in the Tlacolula Valley, 35&nbsp;km to the east of Oaxaca city, was a settlement in the early part of the Monte Alban 1 Period (500 CE). It flourished as an urban centre, following the abandonment of Monte Alban around 800 BCE. However, even Yagul was abandoned for a brief period, before it became a city-state in Oaxaca. This status continued until the [[Spanish Conquistadores]] invaded the valley, which was then a settlement of Zapotecs.<ref name=mexo>{{cite web |url=http://www.mexonline.com/oaxaca/oxarc103.htm |title=Yagul Archaeological Zones – Central Valley |access-date=September 12, 2010 |publisher=Mexonline.com}}</ref> The fortified complex is laid out in three zones; the central part approached through a series of steps is a built-up platform that leads to the temples and palaces.

===Handicrafts===
{{main|Oaxaca handcrafts and folk art}}
[[File:LgCantaroJarMEAPO2.JPG|thumb|left|Barro negro pottery at the state crafts museum]]
Because of its indigenous tradition and abundance of raw materials, Oaxaca is a leading producer of [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|handcrafts in Mexico]]. Handcrafted items here are noted for their variety and quality. Oaxacan handcrafts are traditionally made with wood, wool, clay and leather and are sold in many venues from local [[tianguis]] markets to upscale international stores. The best-known wood craft is the making of "[[alebrije]]" figures, which are usually miniature, brightly colored real or imaginary animals. These were originally created from paper and cardboard in Mexico City, but this craft was adapted to native Oaxacan woodcarving to the form it has today. Carver [[Manuel Jiménez (artist)|Manuel Jiménez]] of [[Santa Cruz Xoxocotlán|Arrazola]] is credited with the creating of the Oaxacan version of this craft. Other wood crafts include the making of masks, toys and utensils. Major woodcarving areas include [[San MartínTilcajete]] and Arrazola.<ref name="atraccul">{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/ |title=Atractivos Culturales y Turísticos |year=2009 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Estado de Oaxaca |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Cultural and Tourist Attractions |access-date=August 15, 2010 |archive-date=January 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110091824/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/ |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="rincones4044">Akaike, pp. 40–44</ref>

[[File:Alebrijes in Oaxaca, Mexico 2009.jpg|thumb|Alebrijes at the Pochote Market in Oaxaca, [[México]]]]

Pottery has a long tradition that extends into the pre-Hispanic period. Oaxaca shares many pottery types with other parts of Mexico along with two of its own: [[barro negro pottery|barro negro]] and the [[green glazed pottery of Atzompa]]. The first is centered in the town of [[San Bartolo Coyotepec]] near the capital city. This pottery gets its color from the local clay used to make it and its shine from a technique developed by Doña Rosa Nieto in the mid-20th century. The Atompa green-glazed ware is made much the same way it was in colonial times, although there have been some recent innovations with color and decorative techniques. This pottery is found in [[Santa María Atzompa]], near Oaxaca city.<ref name="atraccul"/>

Another major craft category is textiles. Textiles from cotton and other fibers date to early in the pre-Hispanic period on backstrap looms. This form of weaving has been dominated by women since that time. The Spanish introduced the wide European frame loom, which is mostly used by men. Traditional clothing items such as [[huipil]]s are still made on backstrap looms, while the European looms are used to produce larger and heavier items such as rugs, [[sarape]]s and blankets, notably in the village of [[Teotitlán del Valle]]. Other items are produced with cotton fibers, although some [[Furcraea|maguey]] fibers can be found, while palm fronds are used to produce mats and hats. Embroidery is an important part of indigenous clothing, especially for women. One municipality noted for its indigenous and embroidered clothing is [[Santo Tomás Jalietza]], just south of the city of Oaxaca. The Xochimilco neighborhood of the capital is known for its embroidered tablecloths, napkins and other tableware.<ref name="rincones43">Akaike, p. 43</ref>

[[File:Artesana elaborando rodete de hoja de plátano en Tavehua, Oaxaca.jpg|thumb|left|Craftswoman making banana leaf bun in Tavehua, Oaxaca.]]
Both precious and non-precious metals are worked in the state. Many gold and silver jewelry items are made with [[filigree]] (fine metal thread) which is weaved and wrapped into shapes. This technique is Arab in origin and was introduced by the Spanish. The municipalities of [[Santo Domingo Tehuantepec]], [[Juchitán de Zaragoza]] and [[Huajuapan de León]] are known for this work. Other metals, especially iron, are forged into utilitarian and decorative items in places such as [[Santiago Jamiltepec]] and [[Tlacolula de Matamoros]]. Items produced include mirrors, frames, figures, knives, machetes and more.<ref name="atraccul"/><ref name="rincones4244">Akaike, pp. 42–44</ref>

===Symbols===

====Flag====
The state of Oaxaca has no official flag, but the state government uses a flag with a white background and a shield in the center.{{clarify|date=June 2017}}

====Coat of Arms====
The coat of arms consists of a red canvas, wrapped around its upper end; inside within a white oval is the inscription "EL RESPETO AL DERECHO AJENO ES LA PAZ" (Respect for the rights of others is peace), and the slogan words are separated from each other by symbolic representations of nopales. The inner oval is divided into three parts: on the bottom are two arms breaking chains; in the upper left is a stylised image of the state of Oaxaca, with the flower and fruit, in a stylised form, of the huaje tree; and at the top right is the profile of one of the palaces from the archaeological site of Mitla, with a Dominican Cross to its right. Around the oval are distributed seven golden stars, three on the bottom, two on the right above the oval and two to the left above the oval. On the bottom of the canvas is the phrase "ESTADO LIBRE Y SOBERANO DE OAXACA" (The Free and Sovereign State of Oaxaca). Above the canvas is the Shield of Mexico.

====State emblem====
*The canvas of gules (red) as parchment: the liberation struggles of Oaxaca.
*The seven stars: each of the seven regions of the state. "Huaxyacac" ancient place name of Oaxaca.
*The two strong arms to breaking the chains of oppression.
