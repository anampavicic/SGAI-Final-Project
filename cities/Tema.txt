Tema metropolitan forms part of the sixteen Metropolis, Municipalities and Districts in the [[Greater Accra Region]].

==History==
Tema was built on the site of a small fishing village called Torman, named for the local name of the [[calabash]] plant, Tor, which was cultivated there. "Tema" is derived from a corruption of "Torman". The government identified the site before [[History of Ghana#Independent Ghana|independence]]{{Broken anchor|date=2024-05-27|bot=User:Cewbot/log/20201008/configuration|target_link=History of Ghana#Independent Ghana|reason= The anchor (Independent Ghana) [[Special:Diff/924907983|has been deleted]].}}, and in 1952 acquired {{convert|166|km2|mi2}} of land north of the harbor, which was entrusted to the [[Tema Development Corporation]] for the new industrial and residential development. The villagers of Torman migrated to a new fishing ground around {{convert|3|km|mi}} away, which they called Newtown.<ref name="ghanaweb.com">[http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/photo.day.php?ID=143811 "Poverty In The Mist of Riches"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004051800/http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/photo.day.php?ID=143811 |date=4 October 2012 }}. GhanaWeb.com. Retrieved 9 March 2013.</ref>

The main Tema Township was constructed, and the [[Tema Harbour]] officially opened, in 1962. Over the following decades, Tema grew into the industrial hub of Ghana, with a carefully constructed road layout featuring landscaping and street lights. It boasted modern recreational centres and other social amenities rare among African cities at the time.<ref name="ghanaweb.com" /> President Nkrumah appointed Theophilus Asiaw Mills as the first District Commissioner. The importance of Tema as a port and industrial hub is reflected by the fact that the [[Ghana Police Service]] maintains a special policing region devoted entirely to the city.

A large population influx began in the 1960s owing to the town's employment opportunities, but the Tema Development Corporation was unable to construct housing and provide other services to meet the needs of the migrants.<ref name="OTAL">[http://www.otal.com/ghana/index.htm#tema Tema] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715021127/http://www.otal.com/ghana/index.htm |date=15 July 2011 }}. OT Africa Line. Retrieved 9 March 2013.</ref> The Tema Newtown district was overwhelmed by the sudden population growth, and became the poor cousin of Tema Township, receiving none of the latter's improved housing, geometrically laid roads, or social amenities. Moreover, royalties paid by Tema Newtown's companies to evicted villagers have not been used due to a chieftaincy dispute. The area's fishing potential was thus not fully exploited.<ref name="ghanaweb.com" />

==Climate==
Tema is characterised by a [[hot semi-arid climate]] (''BSh'' under the [[Köppen climate classification]]). It lies in the driest part of southern Ghana, experiencing average annual rainfall of about {{convert|750|mm|in}}. Average temperatures are very warm to hot year-round, typically exceeding {{convert|28|°C|1|disp=or}} every day of the year, whilst minima never typically fall under {{convert|23|°C|1|disp=or}}.<ref name="GHD"/>

[[File:Containerterminal in Tema, Ghana.jpg|thumb|right|190px|A container terminal at Tema Port in 2008.]]
Tema Port, which was opened in 1962, is the biggest of the two seaports in Ghana. In 2020 a $1.5 billion expansion project to increase container output to 3 million [[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEU]] was completed. The port is currently one of the largest container ports in Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apmterminals.com/en/tema|title=Tema – APM Terminals}}</ref> It has a water-enclosed area of {{convert|1.7|km2|mi2}} and a total land area of {{convert|3.9|km2|mi2}}. Apart from handling Ghanaian imports and exports, it is also a traffic junction, dealing with transit cargo destined for the landlocked countries of [[Burkina Faso]], [[Mali]] and [[Niger]]. The port of Tema handles 80% of Ghana's import and export cargo, including the country's chief export, [[cocoa bean|cacao]].

The port has {{convert|5|km|mi}} of [[breakwaters]], 12 deepwater berths, an outsize [[oil tanker]] berth, a dockyard, warehouses, and transit sheds. The port has open and covered areas for the storage of cargo, including a {{cvt|77200|m2|hectare|1}} paved area for the storage of containers, steel products and other conventional cargo. The port's container yard is capable of holding over 8,000 TEUs at any given time. The closed storage area, which is about {{cvt|25049|m2|hectare|1}} in area, consists of six sheds with a total storage capacity of 50,000 tonnes of cargo. The port also includes a 100,000 [[Deadweight tonnage|dwt]] dry dock and slipway facility.<ref name="GPHA">[http://www.ghanaports.gov.gh/GPHA/tema/index.html Tema] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304053635/http://www.ghanaports.gov.gh/GPHA/tema/index.html |date=4 March 2009 }}.

===Fishing harbor===
Ghana has a long history of fishing. The Tema fishing harbour is at the eastern end of the town's commercial harbour. It comprises the Inner Fishing Harbour, the [[Canoe]] Basin, the Outer Fishing Harbour, and a commercial area with marketing and cold storage facilities.<ref name="OTAL"/>

The Inner Fishing Harbour was constructed along the Tema Main Port in 1962 to provide a handling facility for semi-industrial and industrial fishing vessels, and to encourage the development of the local [[fishing industry]]. In 1965, the Outer Fishing Harbour was constructed for bigger industrial vessels such as [[Fishing trawler|trawlers]], [[tuna]] vessels, and deep-sea carriers.<ref name="OTAL"/> The trawlers operating in the area are {{cvt|30|–|45|m}} long and are able to land 55–65 tonnes of fish (usually [[redfish]] and club and scad [[mackerel]]) per fishing trip. The tuna vessels range from smaller boats around {{cvt|45|–|50|m}} in length, able to land 200–250 tonnes of catch, to larger versions with a length of {{cvt|50|–|65|m}} and the ability to land up to 650 tonnes per fishing trip.<ref name="OTAL"/> The largest fishing vessels, the deep-sea carriers (with lengths of {{cvt|90|–|105|m|disp=comma}}), are mostly [[Chartering (shipping)|chartered]] vessels.<ref name="OTAL"/> Since 1984, the national catch has averaged about 200,000 to 300,000 metric tonnes per annum. Ghana's tuna catch has maintained a stable level of 30,000 tonnes per annum since 1981.<ref name="OTAL"/>

The Canoe Basin caters for the [[artisanal]] [[fishermen]]. The basin is normally occupied by about 400 [[canoe]]s. These are mainly two types: wooden vessels, locally called "Legelege", and metallic vessels. The wooden canoes have lengths over all ([[Length overall|LOA]]) ranging between {{cvt|30|and|70|m}}, mainly owned and operated by [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] Ghanaians.<ref name="GPHA"/> Their operations peak during the months of June–September. Artisanal canoe fishing is responsible for about 70% of the catch.<ref name="GPHA"/>
