'''Sagamu''' or '''Ishagamu''' is an [[Urban agglomeration|agglomeration]] of thirteen towns in southwestern Nigeria. It is located in [[Ogun State]] along the [[Ibu River]] and Eruwuru Stream between [[Lagos State|Lagos]] and [[Ibadan]]. It was founded in the mid 19th century by members of the Remo branch of the [[Yoruba people]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Shagamu|title=Shagamu {{!}} Nigeria|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref>  The 13 towns are: Makun, Offin, Sonyindo, Epe, Ibido, Igbepa, Ado, Oko, Ipoji, Batoro, Ijoku, Ijagba and Latawa.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Shagamu time now.

The Sagamu region is underlain by major deposits of [[limestone]], which is used in the city's major industry, the production of [[cement]]. Agricultural products of the region include [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[kola nuts]]. Sagamu is the largest kola nut collecting center in the country. The kola nut industry supports several secondary industries such as [[basket]] and [[rope]] manufacturing, which are used to store the kola nuts.

The city was founded in the mid-19th century when several small towns united for purpose of defense during the wars brought about by the fall of the [[Oyo Empire]]. Sagamu controlled the trade routes between the ports in the [[Niger Delta]] and the Yoruba mainland until the [[British Empire|British]] occupied the city at the end of the 19th century. Sagamu has experienced both population and economic growth since the 1950s, due to its position between the cities of [[Ibadan]] and [[Lagos]]. The population in 1995 was 114,300 but 2007 estimates placed it as high as 228,382. The [[Olabisi Onabanjo University]]'s college of medicine is located in Sagamu.<ref name="world gazetteer">{{cite web|title=The World Gazetteer|url=http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?men=gpro&des=gamelan&geo=348678364|access-date=2007-04-06|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130210072533/http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?men=gpro&des=gamelan&geo=348678364|archive-date=2013-02-10|url-status=dead}}</ref>
