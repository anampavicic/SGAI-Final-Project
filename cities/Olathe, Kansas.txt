==History==
===19th century===
Olathe was founded by John T. Barton in the spring of 1857. He rode to the center of Johnson County, and staked two quarter sections of land as the town site.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} He later described his ride to friends: "...the prairie was covered with [[verbena]] and other wild flowers. I kept thinking the land was beautiful and that I should name the town Beautiful."{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Purportedly, Barton asked a [[Shawnee]] interpreter how to say "Beautiful" in his native language. The interpreter responded, "Olathe."<ref name="Evolution">{{Cite web|url=http://www.olatheks.org/Visitors/about_evolution.cfm|title=Evolution of Olathe|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928161445/http://www.olatheks.org/Visitors/about_evolution.cfm|archive-date=September 28, 2007|publisher=City of Olathe}}</ref>

Olathe was incorporated in 1857,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Qi9cXyTWt9EC|title=Kansas: A Cyclopedia of State History, Volume 2|author=Blackmar, Frank Wilson|publisher=Standard Publishing Company|year=1912|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Qi9cXyTWt9EC/page/n376 386]}}</ref> and while not the first city in Johnson County, its rapid growth led to it being named the [[county seat]] in October 1859.<ref name="Evolution"/> Rising tensions across the nation over the issue of [[slavery]] led to numerous clashes between [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] settlers and neighboring slave state [[Missouri]]. These clashes further escalated and become a part of the greater conflict known as [[Bleeding Kansas]]. With the admission of Kansas into the Union as a [[slave and free states|free state]] in 1861, violence began to dissipate. Peace continued to elude Olathe for many years to come, however. In 1861, Union officials and local military forces created a military post in the city. It housed one company of troops along with the local militia.

On September 6, 1862, [[William Quantrill]] led a surprise raid of guerrilla [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]] against the city, which resulted in a half dozen deaths and the destruction of most of the city. Quantrill captured the outpost and tried forcing the men to swear an oath to the Confederacy. The oath was deemed invalid in November 1862, since the guerrillas were not considered legitimate enemy military units.<ref>William E. Connelley, ''Quantrill and the Border Wars'' (Cedar Rapids, Iowa: Torch Press, 1909), pp. 234, 271. This book may also be found on the Internet Archive website, at https://archive.org/stream/quantrillborderw00connuoft/quantrillborderw00connuoft_djvu.txt .</ref><ref>Capt. James Christian, report, ''The War of the Rebellion'' (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1899), Series II, Vol. IV, p. 721.</ref><ref>John W. Noble, letter, ''The War of the Rebellion'', Series II, Vol. IV, pp. 721-2.</ref> Kansas militia continued to occupy the Olathe military post through the rest of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

Confederate forces attempted two further raids against the city. The first happened on August 20–21, 1863, as Quantrill was passing through on his way to [[Lawrence, Kansas]] (see [[Lawrence Massacre]]).  The second raid occurred October 24–5, 1864, when Confederate [[Major general|Major General]] [[Sterling Price]], with a force of 10,000 men, passed through on their retreat south (see [[Price's Raid]]).<ref>Connelley, pp. 397-8.</ref><ref>First Lieut.

John Pope, report, ''The War of the Rebellion'' (1896), Series I, Vol. XLVIII, Part I, p. 351.</ref>

Olathe served as a stop on the [[Oregon Trail]], the [[California Trail]], and the [[Santa Fe Trail]]. Catering to travelers was the main source of income for local stores and businesses. The [[Mahaffie House]], a popular resupply point for wagons headed westward, is today a registered historical site maintained by the City of Olathe. The staff wears period costumes, and stagecoach rides and farm animals make the site a favorite among children. Visitors can participate in Civil War re-enactments, Wild West Days, and other activities.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

After the construction of the [[transcontinental railroad]], the trails to the west lost importance, and Olathe faded into obscurity and remained a small, sleepy prairie town.

===20th century===
In the 1950s, the construction of the [[interstate highway]] system and, more directly, [[Interstate 35]], linked Olathe to nearby [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. The result was tremendous residential growth as Olathe became a part of the Kansas City metropolitan area. In the 1980s, Olathe experienced tremendous commercial growth, which also drew more residents.  Olathe's population is estimated to have surpassed 100,000 in 2001, and later projections showed Olathe's growth continuing as the city expanded into the farm fields south, west, and north of town.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Geography==
Olathe is bordered by the cities of [[Lenexa, Kansas|Lenexa]] to the north, [[Overland Park, Kansas|Overland Park]] to the east, [[De Soto, Kansas|De Soto]] to the northwest, and [[Gardner, Kansas|Gardner]] to the southwest.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|60.42|sqmi|sqkm|2}} of which {{convert|59.66|sqmi|sqkm|2}} are land and {{convert|0.76|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is covered by water.<ref name="Gazetteer files">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=2012-07-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archive-date=2012-01-25 }}</ref> Olathe has two public lakes: Lake Olathe with {{convert|172|acre|km2}} of water surface and Cedar Lake with {{convert|45|acre|km2}}.

Olathe's Black Bob Park is named after [[Hathawekela]] [[Shawnee]] Chief [[Black Bob (Shawnee chief)|Black Bob]].<ref>{{Cite web|title       = Black Bob Park|work        = Olathe Parks and Recreation, Olathe Kansas|access-date  = 2013-02-17|url         = http://www.olatheks.org/parksrec/programs/trails/parklocations/blackbob|url-status     = dead|archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080319001212/http://www.olatheks.org/parksrec/programs/trails/parklocations/blackbob|archive-date = 2008-03-19}}</ref>

===Climate===
Olathe has a humid continental climate, with cold winters and hot summers. Temperatures range from an average high of {{convert|39|°F}} and low {{convert|20|°F}} in January to an average high of nearly {{convert|90|°F}} in July. The temperature reaches {{convert|90|°F}} an average of 36 days per year and {{convert|100|°F}} an average of 3 days per year. The minimum temperature falls below freezing (32&nbsp;°F) an average of 102 days per year, but rarely drops below {{convert|10|°F}}. Typically, the first frost occurs between mid-October and the first week of November, and the last frost occurs between the end of March and the second week of April.

The area receives about {{convert|40|in|mm}} of precipitation during an average year, with the largest share being received in May and June—the April–June period averages 30 days of measurable precipitation. During a typical year, the total amount of precipitation may be  28 to almost 53&nbsp;inches. On average, 95 days of measurable precipitation occur per year. Winter snowfall averages about 19&nbsp;inches, but the median is {{convert|13|in|mm}}. Measurable snowfall occurs an average of 9 days per year, with at least an inch of snow being received on seven of those days. Snow depth of at least an inch occurs an average of 25 days per year.
