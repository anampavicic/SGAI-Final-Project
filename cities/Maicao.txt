==History==

Maicao was inhabited by the [[Wayuu]] people prior to the arrival of the [[Spanish people|Spanish]]. The Wayuu gave strong resistance to the Spanish conquest, remaining rebellious until the early 20th century. Maicao was officially founded on June 27, 1927 by Colonel Rodolfo Morales and Tomás Curvelo Iguarán, on behalf of the Department of Magdalena in the middle of the [[Wayuu]] people territory.<ref name="Maicao: History"/>

One of the first families to settle in the area were those of José Domingo Boscán and Manuel Palacio López, who settled near the Venezuelan border between the road that connects Riohacha and Maraicaibo, in addition to the fact that this area had relatively fertile land.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Rosselli |first=Diego |title=Los vaivenes de Maicao |url=https://www.portafolio.co/economia/finanzas/vaivenes-maicao-298834 |access-date=2022-08-09 |website=Portafolio.co |language=spanish}}</ref> In 1927, several wells and windmills were built in the area by a German firm.<ref name=":0" /> In 1929, the township (Spanish: ''Corregimiento'') of Maicao was created, following population growth.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Viloria |first=Joaquín |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEHxBwAAQBAJ&dq=Maicao+Historia&pg=PT153 |title=Empresarios del Caribe Colombiano: Historia económica y empresarial del Magdalena Grande y del Bajo Magdalena, 1870-1930 |date=2015-03-13 |publisher=Banco de la República, Colombia |isbn=978-958-664-298-9 |language=es}}</ref> By 1940, Maicao had 500 inhabitants.<ref name=":0" />

The indigenous Wayuu managed contraband trading routes through Maicao arriving from [[Aruba]], [[Curaçao]], [[Venezuela]] and other [[Caribbean Sea]] territories mostly coffee, alcohol, tobacco and weapons among other taxable articles. During the 1970s Maicao became a commercial hub due to an oil boom in Venezuela and the flow of contraband present in the Guajira peninsula. The commercial boom attracted Arab and other Middle Eastern immigrants most of whom established in Maicao as merchants, establishing another culture in the area.

=== Arab Migration ===
Due to Maicao's proximity to the Venezuelan border, it attracted a number of immigrants to the municipality, in addition to its free port characteristics, and in the 1970's it attracted a number of Arab immigrants from the Levant. In 1989, the Colombo-Arab College Dar el Arkam was created.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=David |first1=Cortés Guerrero, José |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QCduEAAAQBAJ&dq=Maicao+Historia&pg=PT152 |title=Historia de la religión en Colombia, 1510-2021 |last2=María |first2=Marín Leoz, Juana |last3=Fabián |first3=García Rincón, Leonardo |last4=Elvis |first4=Plata, William |last5=Paola |first5=Hernández Fernández, Diana |last6=José |first6=Campillo Pardo, Alberto |last7=Aliza |first7=Moreno-Goldschmidt |last8=Yidi |first8=David, Odette |last9=Enrique |first9=Salcedo Martínez, Jorge |date=2021-11-30 |publisher=Editorial Universidad del Rosario |isbn=978-958-784-793-2 |language=es}}</ref> The migrants settled in the center of Maicao, where one of them, José Abuchaibe of Palestinian origin, built the largest building in the municipality, which is the Hotel Don Juan.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last=Albarracín |first=Carlos Jair Martínez |date=2006 |title=Introducción a la situación sociolingüística de la comunidad árabe de Maicao, Guajira (Colombia) |url=https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=6288119 |journal=Estudios de dialectología norteafricana y andalusí, EDNA |issue=10 |pages=7–51 |issn=1137-7968}}</ref> In 1997 Middle Eastern immigrants built the [[Mosque of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab]], one of the largest mosques in South America.

===Colombian armed conflict period===
{{Main|Colombian armed conflict}}
The [[marijuana]] bonanza in the outskirts of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountains also introduced another factor to the culture of the region. ''Marimberos'' or drug dealers initiated exports of numerous [[illegal drug trade in Colombia|illegal drug trade]] to the United States and Europe where there was a high demand for drugs. Opulence in certain urban areas became notable, including a [[Ferrari]]s collection by Lafaurie-González clan (Eduardo, Iván and Fernando Lafaurie-Gonzalez) and their bunker style houses in Maicao and Riohacha.<ref>[http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/colombia/libros/jinetes/cap1.html {{in lang|es}} Los Jinetes de la Cocaina: La Mafia en Macondo]</ref>
 
During the 1980s and 1990s the internal [[Colombian armed conflict]] between the government of Colombia and numerous revolutionary groups mainly the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC) and the [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|National Liberation Army]] began to affect the municipality of Maicao. Extortions, kidnappings and assassinations became a common practice. The situation worsened due to the deflation of the Venezuelan economy and the trade decrease, as well as crackdowns on contraband by the Colombian government.

In 1991 was given special customs status in 1991 in order to spur job growth. The government's intent was to allow raw materials to enter the zone untaxed, have workers there turn them into finished product, and then re-export the finished goods outside Colombia. The law allowed for a certain amount of goods to pass from Maicao into the Colombian interior, but only if they were declared to customs officials and duty was paid on them. Cigarettes however moved outside the Maicao special customs zone "duty not paid" and from there into the black market.

Maicao became subject to royalties coming from the exploitation of [[coal]] in the [[Cerrejon]] coal mine, however municipal administrations have been subject to widespread corruption and royalties have been temporarily suspended. The culture of avoiding paying taxes has created in numerous occasions tensions between the locals and the government, including burning down the local tax bureau office [[DIAN]] in protest for confiscating large amounts of contraband. The municipality also suffered a problem of displaced people due to the internal armed conflict and deficiencies in education and health.<ref name="elpilon.com.co">[http://www.elpilon.com.co/noticias/op00000935.htm {{in lang|es}} El Pilon: Las regalías de Maicao by Salomón Kalmanovitz]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Hezbollah ties===

According to [[FBI]] investigators who allegedly told Rio de Janeiro's ''[[O Globo]]'' in late October 2001 that in addition to the Triborder Region, a focal point of terrorism in South America was Maicao, described as an Islamic community of approximately 4,670 vacation spot for orthodox Islamics and the largest and best organized Islamic community in Colombia with a minority Shiites reportedly more closely associated with the Muslim fundamentalist concept.<ref name="loc.gov">[https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/pdf-files/NarcsFundedTerrs_Extrems.pdf Library of Congress: Federal Research Division; Narcotics Funded Terrorists/Extremist Groups]</ref> The report said that there were cells of the radical group [[Hezbollah]] and that it controlled up to 70 percent of the local commerce. "The merchants from there make contributions equivalent to 10 percent and even up to 30 percent of their profits. And those responsible for the fund send the money via banks in [[Maracaibo]] in Venezuela, and in [[Panama]].<ref name="loc.gov"/>

The Department of Administrative Security (Departamento de Seguridad Administrativa―DAS) shut down a clandestine radio station in Maicao on August 15, 1997, for broadcasting Hezbollah propaganda, and a couple of arrests for money laundering, Maicao's Muslim community reportedly has had few contacts with the law. Nevertheless, it is known that the black market for weapons and money laundering in Maicao and neighboring Zulia State in Venezuela is well established.<ref name="loc.gov"/>

Hezbollah cells based within Maicao have used drug trafficking and contraband networks to launder funds that were later used to finance terrorist operations worldwide.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/work-document/iran-and-its-proxy-hezbollah-strategic-penetration-in-latin-america-wp/ | title=Iran and its Proxy Hezbollah: Strategic Penetration in Latin America }}</ref>

=== Modern Times ===
On March 19, 2000 the town of [[Albania, La Guajira|Albania]] segregated some 425&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> from Maicao and became a municipality. The municipality of Maicao lost a large area over the coal mine section decreasing the royalties percentage intended for the region.<ref name="elpilon.com.co" /><ref>[http://www.laguajira.gov.co/municipios/albania.htm {{in lang|es}} Gobernacion de La Guajira - Albania: generalities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813150800/http://www.laguajira.gov.co/municipios/albania.htm|date=2007-08-13}}</ref>

== Economy ==
Ninety percent of Maicao's economy depends on commerce and the rest is mainly in the service sector, in addition to a small percentage in the manufacturing industry. According to statistics from the Chamber of Commerce of the Municipality it is estimated that there are 1300 registered commercial stores.<ref name=":1" /> In 1992, the Special Customs Regime Zone of Maicao, Uribia and Manaureo was established in 1992 to regulate trade in the area.<ref name=":1" /> One of the products grown in Maicao is Ahuyama, better known as [[Cucurbita moschata]], this vegetable is processed into flour from this municipality and marketed in European countries.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-08-28 |title=Maicao exporta harina de ahuyama a Holanda y Europa |url=https://diariolalibertad.com/sitio/2020/08/28/maicao-exporta-harina-de-ahuyama-a-holanda-y-europa/ |access-date=2022-08-09 |website=La Libertad |language=es}}</ref>

== Culture ==

*[[Mosque of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab]], built in September 1997, is the third largest mosque in South America. Although, Colombia is predominantly a Roman Catholic country, the region around Maicao has a large Lebanese Muslim migrant population who funded and built the mosque.

==Transportation==
The municipality of Maicao had one now closed airstrip, [[Maicao Airport|La Majayura Airport]], which has been closed, but may reopen.<ref>[http://abc.senado.gov.co/prontus_senado/site/artic/20080311/pags/20080311171754.html {{in lang|es}} Senate of Colombia: Senador Ballesteros lidera proceso para garantizar reapertura de aeropuerto de Maicao]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The city is now served by [[Jorge Isaacs Airport]], which is located {{convert|40|km}} in the southwest. It is  also still a major transportation hub between Venezuela and Colombia.

Land transportation is served by a two-lane single-road highway, crossing the municipality of Maicao from [[Rio Hacha]] towards Venezuela and another from the town of Maicao south towards [[Valledupar]].  While much of the trade is legitimate, there is also a great deal of smuggling and contraband.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vivatravelguides.com/south-america/colombia/the-guajira-peninsula/maicao/?no_cache=1|title = - VIVA Travel Guides - Guide books and ebooks about Latin America, made in Latin America}}</ref>

== Heritage Sites ==
Maicao has several tourist sites such as the Monumento a la Identidad, a sculpture made by Cartagena artist Alfredo Tatis Benzo, this monument is also known as "El Abuelo de las Barbas del Maíz" ({{Lit|The Grandfather of the Corn Beards|lk=yes|i=yes}}) in reference to how Maicao received its name.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=2019-05-24 |title=Maicao presente en el turismo colombiano |url=https://caracol.com.co/programa/2019/05/24/el_sabor_de_colombia/1558716248_265638.html |access-date=2022-08-09 |website=Caracol Radio |language=es}}</ref> In addition there is the Plaza Bolivar of Maicao, it had a statue of Simon Bolivar that collapsed in 2021 from strong breezes, this statue had remained for more than 34 years in the square.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=2022-05-10 |title=Alcalde Mohamad Dasuki, develó nueva estatua de Simón Bolívar, en plaza principal de Maicao |url=https://regioncaribe.com.co/alcalde-mohamad-dasuki-develo-nueva-estatua-de-simon-bolivar-en-plaza-principal-de-maicao/ |access-date=2022-08-09 |website=Región Caribe |language=es}}</ref> In May 2022, a new statue was put up again, this time by the artist of the municipality, Vespaciano Ruiz Pichón.<ref name=":3" /> Another religious site in the municipality is the San José Church, which is the patron saint of the municipality.<ref>{{Cite web |last=González |first=Eira |date=2018-03-14 |title=Maicao se prepara para las fiestas patronales de San José |url=https://laguajirahoy.com/featured/maicao-se-prepara-para-las-fiestas-patronales-de-san-jose.html |access-date=2022-08-09 |website=La Guajira Hoy |language=es}}</ref>
