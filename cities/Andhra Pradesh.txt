'''Andhra Pradesh''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑː|n|d|r|ə|_|p|r|ə|ˈ|d|eɪ|ʃ}}; [[ISO 15919|ISO]]: {{transliteration|te|ISO|Āndhra Pradēś}}; {{IPA-te|aːndʱrɐ prɐdeːʃ|lang|andhra pradesh.ogg}} {{abbr.}} '''AP''') is a [[States and union territories of India|state]] in the southern coastal region of [[India]]. It is the [[List of states and union territories of India by area|seventh-largest state]] and the [[List of states and union territories of India by population|tenth-most populous]] in the country. [[Telugu language|Telugu]], one of India's [[Classical languages of India|classical languages]], is the primary official language and the most widely spoken language. [[Amaravati]] is the state capital, while the largest city is [[Visakhapatnam]]. The state shares borders with [[Telangana]] to the northwest, [[Odisha]] to the northeast, [[Chhattisgarh]] to the north, [[Karnataka]] to the southwest, [[Tamil Nadu]] to the south, and the [[Bay of Bengal]] to the southeast. It has the [[Coastline of Andhra Pradesh|second-longest coastline]] in India at about {{cvt|974|km}}.

Archaeological evidence suggests that Andhra Pradesh has had continuous human presence for over 247,000 years, ranging from early archaic [[Hominini|hominins]] to [[Neolithic]] settlements. The earliest mention of the Andhras occurs in [[Aitareya Brahmana]] ({{Circa|800 [[BCE]]}}) of the [[Rigveda]]. Around 300 BCE, the Andhras living in the Godavari and Krishna river deltas were renowned for their formidable military strength—second only to the [[Maurya Empire]] in the subcontinent. The first major Andhra polity was the [[Satavahana dynasty]] (2nd century BCE–2nd century CE) which ruled over the entire [[Deccan Plateau]] and even distant areas of western and central India. They established trade relations with the [[Roman Empire]]. After that, the major rulers included the [[Vishnukundina dynasty|Vishnukundinas]], [[Eastern Chalukyas]], [[Kakatiya dynasty|Kakatiyas]], [[Vijayanagara Empire]], [[Sultanate of Golconda|Qutb Shahis]], and the [[British Raj]]. After Indian independence, [[Andhra State]] was bifurcated from Madras state in 1953. It was merged with Telangana, comprising Telugu speaking areas of the former Hyderabad state, to form [[United Andhra Pradesh|Andhra Pradesh]] in 1956. It reverted to its earlier form on 2 June 2014, when the new state of Telangana was formed through bifurcation.

The Eastern ghats separate coastal plains and [[peneplain]]s. [[Krishna River|Krishna]], [[Godavari River|Godavari]], and [[Penna River|Penna]] are the major rivers. The state has about one-third of India's [[limestone]] reserves, large deposits of [[baryte]] and [[granite]]. The population engaged in agriculture and related activities is 62.17%. Rice is the state's major food crop and staple food. The state contributes to 30% of fish production in India and had a share of 35% in total sea food exports of India. Sriharikota Range at the barrier island of [[Sriharikota]] in Tirupati district, is the primary satellite launching station of India.

[[Amaravati art|Amaravati School of Art]], a major ancient Indian art style that influenced South Indian, [[Sri Lanka]]n, and [[Southeast Asia]]n art arose from this state. [[Kuchipudi]], one of India's [[Classical dances of India|classical dances]] originated in the state. Several renowned [[Carnatic music]] composers trace their origins to the state. The state is home to a variety of [[Tourism in Andhra Pradesh#Religious and pilgrimage sites|pilgrimage centres]] and [[Tourism in Andhra Pradesh#Nature tourism|natural attractions]] such as [[Venkateswara Temple, Tirumala|Tirumala Venkateswara temple]] near [[Tirupati]], [[Mallikarjuna Temple, Srisailam|Mallikarjuna temple]] at Srisailam, and [[Araku valley]]. 
[[Tirupati Laddu]], [[Benishan (mango)|Banganapalle mangoes]], [[Kondapalli Toys]], [[Dharmavaram handloom pattu sarees and paavadas|Dharmavaram sarees]], and [[Pootharekulu]] are few products produced in the state with geographical indication registration.

According to the [[Sanskrit]] text [[Aitareya Brahmana]] (800–500 [[BCE]]), a group of people named Andhras left North India off the banks of the [[Yamuna]] and settled in South India.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ancient and medieval history of Andhra Pradesh |url= https://archive.org/details/ancientmedievalh0000ragh|url-access=registration|author=P.

=== Pre-history===
Excavated stone tools from Hanumanthunipadu in Prakasam district were dated to be 2.47 [[lakh]] (247,000) years old ([[Middle Paleolithic]]). This finding means that these tools were developed by archaic hominin (pre-humans) as such tools were thought to be used by modern man migrating out of Africa about 2.10 lakh years ago.

[[File:Vegetarian Andhra Meal.jpg|thumb|Vegetarian Andhra meal, served on important occasions]]
Andhra meals are combinations of spicy, tangy, and sweet flavours. The use of chillies, tamarind, and ''[[gongura]]'' (leaves of roselle) is common in Andhra food.{{Sfn|APTDC|2019|p=54–63}} Curry leaves are used copiously in most preparations of curries and chutneys. Various types of ''Pappu'' are made using lentils in combination with [[tomato]]es, [[spinach]], gongura, [[ridge gourd]], etc. Apart from curries, ''pulusu'', a stew made using [[tamarind]] juice in combination with vegetables, sea food, chicken, mutton, etc., is popular. ''Pachchadi'', a paste usually made with a combination of [[peanut|groundnuts]], fried vegetables, and chillies, is a must in a meal. Pickles made using mangoes, gooseberries, lemons, etc. are enjoyed in combination with ''Pappu''. Buttermilk and yoghurt mixed with rice eaten towards the end of the meal soothe the body, especially after eating spicy food items earlier.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.indianculture.gov.in/food-and-culture/south/andhra-cuisine-symphony-spices |title=Andhra cuisine: A symphony of spices |access-date=29 May 2023 |website=Indianculture.gov.in |archive-date=29 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230529003146/https://www.indianculture.gov.in/food-and-culture/south/andhra-cuisine-symphony-spices |url-status=live }}</ref>

A tamarind-rich dish popularly known as ''Pulihora'' is made with a thick sauce of tamarind, chillies, salt and asafoetida. It is tempered with mustard, curry leaves, peanuts and mixed with rice. It is offered even to the gods and then served as ''prasadam'' (divine offering) in the temples to the devotees. Popular vegetarian curries include ''Dondakaya koora'' (ivy gourd cooked with coconut and green chilli) and ''Guttivankaya koora''(stuffed brinjal curry). ''Thalakaya koora'' (lamb head gravy), ''Royyala koora'' (prawns cooked in tamarind), and ''Natukodi koora'' (free hold chicken curry with chillies) are popular non vegetarian dishes across Guntur and surrounding regions. ''Yeta mamsam kobbari'' biryani (mutton cooked with coconut), ''Seema kodi'' (Rayalaseema-style chicken), ''Chennuru dum biryani'', and ''Gongura mamsam'' (mutton cooked in sorrel gravy) are popular non vegetarian dishes in Rayalaseema. Among fish preparations, ''Pulasa pulusu'', thick aromatic and tangy gravy made from a single fish of the Godavari Pulasa variety is most desired in Konaseema. ''[[Ariselu]]'', ''Burelu'', ''[[Laddu]]'', and ''[[Pootharekulu]]'' are some of the sweets made for special festivals and occasions. ''Pootharekulu'', a preparation of sugar and rice flour and ''Taandri'', a mango flavoured sun dried fruit jelly are popular sweets originating from Athreyapuram in Konaseema. Kakinada ''Khaaja'' layered flour deep fried and dipped in sugar is another popular sweetmeat.{{Sfn|APTDC|2019|p=60-62}} ''[[Bandar laddu]]'', ''[[Tirupati Laddu]]'' are some of the food products with GI status.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Naidu|first1=T.
