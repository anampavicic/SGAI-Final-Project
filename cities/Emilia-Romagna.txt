Its capital is [[Bologna]]. It has an area of {{convert|22446|km2|0|abbr=on}}, and a population of 4.4 million.

Emilia-Romagna is one of the wealthiest and most developed regions in Europe, with the third highest [[gross domestic product]] per capita in Italy. It is also a cultural center, being the home of the [[University of Bologna]], the oldest university in the world. Some of its cities, such as [[Modena]], [[Parma]], [[Ferrara]], and [[Ravenna]], are UNESCO heritage sites. It is a center for [[food]] and [[automobile]] production (such as [[Ferrari]], [[Lamborghini]], and [[Maserati]]). It has coastal resorts such as [[Cervia]], [[Cesenatico]], and [[Rimini]]. In 2018, the [[Lonely Planet]] guide named Emilia-Romagna as the best place to see in Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/best-in-europe|title=10 best places to visit in Europe in 2019|first=Lonely|last=Planet|website=Lonely Planet}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name ''Emilia-Romagna'' is a legacy of [[Ancient Rome]]. ''Emilia'' derives from the ''[[via Aemilia]]'', the Roman road connecting [[Piacenza]] to [[Rimini]], completed in 187 BC, and named after the consul [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 187 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]].<ref>[[Livy]] ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' XXXIX 1; Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum 617</ref> ''Romagna'' derives from ''Romània'', the name of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] applied to [[Ravenna]] by the [[Lombards]] when the [[Western Roman Empire|western Empire]] had ceased to exist and Ravenna was [[Exarchate of Ravenna|an outpost of the east (540–751)]].{{cn|date=August 2023}}

== History ==

[[File:Castello esterno.jpg|thumb|[[Castello Estense|Castle Estense]] in [[Ferrara]]]]

===Prehistory and antiquity===
{{Unreferencedsect|date=August 2024}}
Before the Romans took control of present-day Emilia-Romagna, it had been part of the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] world and subsequently that of the [[Gauls]]. During the first thousand years of Christianity, trade flourished, as did culture and religion, thanks to the region's numerous [[monasteries]].

===Early origins===
{{Unreferencedsect|date=August 2024}}
The history of Emilia-Romagna dates back to Roman times when the region of Emilia was ruled by imperial judges linked to the nearby regions of either [[Liguria]] or [[Tuscany]]. After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century, the Lombards, a Germanic tribe, founded the [[Kingdom of the Lombards|kingdom of Lombardy]] in northern and central Italy. This kingdom, which included the region known as Emilia, flourished until the Lombard dynasty was overthrown by the Frankish king [[Charlemagne]] in 774. From the 6th to 8th centuries, the region of Romagna was under Byzantine rule and Ravenna was the capital of the Exarchate of Italy within the Eastern Roman Empire. In the 8th century, this region became a province of the [[Papal States]] when Pepin, the father of Charlemagne, donated the land to the Pope in 754.

===High Middle Ages to early modern period===
{{Moresources|section|date=August 2023}}
During the 10th century, northern Italy became part of the Holy Roman Empire under the control of the Germanic leader Otto I. The Holy Roman emperors had varying degrees of control over northern Italy until the close of the Middle Ages. In the 12th century, the papacy extended its political influence and city states began to form in opposition to the Holy Roman emperors.

The northern cities, supported by the Pope, formed the [[Lombard League]] and reduced the influence of the ruling Hohenstaufen dynasty over their lands. Division between imperial partisans and their opponents created factions called the Guelphs and the Ghibelines which would divide the cities for centuries. For the next few centuries both Emilia and Romagna were ruled by papal legates or representatives of the Pope.

The [[University of Bologna]]—the oldest university in the world, established in AD 1088—and its bustling towns kept trade and intellectual life alive. Local nobility like the [[House of Este|Este]] of Ferrara, the [[House of Malatesta|Malatesta]] of Rimini, the [[Papal State|Popes of Rome]], the [[House of Farnese|Farnese]] of Parma and Piacenza, and the [[Duchy of Modena and Reggio]], jostled for power and influence.

The [[House of Este]] gained a notable profile for its political and military might and its patronage of the arts: it left behind a vast heritage of splendid Renaissance palaces, precious paintings and literary masterpieces, such as the works of [[Ludovico Ariosto]], [[Torquato Tasso]] and [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]].

Following the rise of [[Napoleon]], the region of Emilia came under French control.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Musei Civici Reggio Emilia » Napoleone e la Repubblica Reggiana |url=https://www.musei.re.it/collezioni/museo-del-tricolore/sala-napoleonica/napoleone-e-la-repubblica-reggiana/ |access-date=9 May 2022 |website=musei.re.it}}</ref> After the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, there was a growing movement for Italian national unity and independence. In 1848, a revolution in Vienna initiated uprisings against Austrian rule. The following decades saw uprisings in several regions and, in 1861, the Kingdom of Italy was established. During this [[Italian Unification]], the territories of Emilia and Romagna would be incorporated into the new nation.

===Late modern and contemporary===
In the 16th century, most of what would become Emilia-Romagna had been seized by the Papal States, but the territories of Parma, Piacenza, and Modena remained independent until Emilia-Romagna became part of the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian kingdom]] between 1859 and 1861.

After the First world war, Emilia-Romagna was at the centre of the so-called [[Biennio Rosso]], a period of left-wing agitations that paved the way for [[Benito Mussolini]]'s coup d'état in 1922 and the birth of the Fascist regime in Italy. Mussolini, a native of Emilia-Romagna, sponsored the rise of many hierarchs coming from his same region, such as [[Italo Balbo]], [[Dino Grandi]] and [[Edmondo Rossoni]].

Towards the end of the [[Second World War]], Emilia-Romagna was [[Operation Achse|occupied by Germany]] and has been the theatre of numerous [[Nazi war crimes]], such as the [[Marzabotto massacre]] in which 770 innocent civilians were brutally executed by German troops.

During the [[Cold war era]], Bologna, traditionally a [[left-wing]] city, was particularly hit by political street violence and [[terrorism]]; in 1980 a [[far-right terrorist]] group [[Bologna massacre|detonated a bomb]] at the city's main railway station, killing 85 people and wounding more than 200.

After the referendum of 2006, seven municipalities of [[Montefeltro]] were detached from the [[Province of Pesaro and Urbino]] ([[Marche]]) to join that of [[Province of Rimini|Rimini]] on 15 August 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iusetnorma.it/news_normativa/normativa/l-03-08-09n117.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722040247/http://www.iusetnorma.it/news_normativa/normativa/l-03-08-09n117.htm|url-status=dead|title=Article about the legislation|archive-date=22 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{in lang|it}} [http://www.ilrestodelcarlino.it/rimini/cronaca/2010/07/10/355107-valmarecchia_rimane_emilia_romagna.shtml Article] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419054858/http://www.ilrestodelcarlino.it/rimini/cronaca/2010/07/10/355107-valmarecchia_rimane_emilia_romagna.shtml |date=19 April 2016}} on "[[il Resto del Carlino]]"</ref> The municipalities are [[Casteldelci]], [[Maiolo]], [[Novafeltria]], [[Pennabilli]], [[San Leo]], [[Sant'Agata Feltria]] and [[Talamello]].

On 20 and 29 May 2012 two [[2012 Emilia earthquakes|powerful earthquakes]] struck the central area of the region, killing 27 people and causing substantial damages to the region's artistic heritage as well as to numerous manufacturing facilities. The 5.8 magnitude earthquake left 14,000 people temporarily homeless.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/International/2012/May-30/175070-17-dead-and-200-injured-in-latest-killer-quake-in-northern-italy.ashx#axzz1wIcDRVY7 |title=Dailystar, 17 dead and 200 injured in latest killer quake in northern Italy|author=Colleen Barry |publisher=Dailystar.com.lb |date=30 May 2012 |access-date=28 November 2013}}</ref>

== Geography ==
{{Moresources|section|date=August 2023}}
[[File:Reliefkarte Emilia-Romagna 2019.png|thumb|Relief map of Emilia-Romagna]]
[[File:Saline di Comacchio.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Lagoons along the [[Po (river)|Po]] delta]]
{{see also|Po Delta Interregional Park}}
The region of Emilia-Romagna consists of nine provinces and covers an area of {{cvt|22,446|km2|sqmi}}, ranking sixth in Italy. Nearly half of the region (48%) consists of plains while 27% is hilly and 25% mountainous. The region's section of the [[Apennines]] is marked by areas of [[flysch]], [[badland]] erosion ([[calanques]]) and [[cave]]s. The mountains stretch for more than {{convert|300|km|2|abbr=on}} from the north to the south-east, with only three peaks above 2,000&nbsp;m – [[Monte Cimone]] (2,165 m), [[Monte Cusna]] (2,121&nbsp;m) and [[Alpe di Succiso]] (2,017&nbsp;m).

The plain was formed by the gradual retreat of the sea from the [[Po basin]] and by the detritus deposited by the rivers. Almost entirely [[marshland]] in ancient times, its history is characterised by the hard work of its people to reclaim and reshape the land in order to achieve a better standard of living.

The [[geology]] varies, with [[lagoon]]s and saline areas in the north and many [[thermal spring]]s throughout the rest of the region as a result of groundwater rising towards the surface at different periods of history. All the rivers rise locally in the Apennines except for the Po, which has its source in the [[Alps]] in [[Piedmont]]. The northern border of Emilia-Romagna follows the path of the river for {{convert|263|km|mi|frac=2|abbr=on}}.

The region has temperate broadleaved and mixed forests and the vegetation may be divided into belts: the [[Quercus robur|Common oak]]-[[Carpinus betulus|European hornbeam]] belt ([[Padan plain]] and adriatic coast) which is now covered (apart from the Mesóla forest in [[Province of Ferrara]]) with fruit orchards and fields of [[wheat]] and [[sugar beet]], the [[Quercus pubescens|Pubescent oak]]-[[Ostrya carpinifolia|European hop-hornbeam]] belt on the lower slopes up to 800&ndash;900&nbsp;m, the [[Fagus sylvatica|European beech]]-[[Abies alba|Silver fir]] belt between 800&ndash;900&nbsp;m and 1,700&nbsp;m and the final mountain [[heath]] belt above 1,700&ndash;1,800&nbsp;m. Emilia-Romagna has two Italian National Parks, the [[Foreste Casentinesi, Monte Falterona, Campigna National Park|Foreste Casentinesi National Park]] and the [[Appennino Tosco-Emiliano National Park]].

=== Land use ===
Emilia-Romagna has been a highly populated area since ancient times. Inhabitants over the centuries have radically altered the [[landscape]], building cities, reclaiming wetlands, and establishing large agricultural areas. All these transformations in past centuries changed the aspect of the region, converting large natural areas to cultivation, up until the 1960s. The trend then changed, and agricultural lands began giving way to residential and industrial areas. The increase of urban-industrial areas continued at very high rates until the end of the 2010s. In the same period, hilly and mountainous areas saw an increase in the registration of semi-natural areas, because of the abandonment of agricultural lands.

[[Land use]] changes can have strong effects on ecological functions. Human interactions such as agriculture, forestation and deforestation affect [[Soil functions|soil function]], e.g. food and other biomass production, storing, filtering and transformation, habitat and gene pool.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2002:0179:FIN:EN:PDF |last=European Commission|title=Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, Towards a Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection. Thematic strategy for soil protection COM(2002)179|publisher=European Commission, Brussels|year=2002}}</ref>

In the Emilia-Romagna plain, which represents half of the region and where three quarters of the population of the region live, the agricultural land area has been reduced by 157&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> while urban and industrial areas have increased to over 130&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> between 2003 and 2008. The impact of [[land use]] and particularly of the urbanisation of the Emilia-Romagna plain during this period has had some strong consequences in the economic and ecological assessment of the region. The loss of arable land is equivalent to a permanent loss of the capacity to feed 440,000 persons per year from resources grown within the region.  The increased [[water runoff]] due to [[soil sealing]] requires adaptation measures for river and irrigation canals such as the building of [[retention basin]]s, at a total cost estimated in the order of billions of euros.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Malucelli|first=F. |author2=Certini, G. |author3=Scalenghe, R.|title=Soil is brown gold in the Emilia-Romagna Region|journal=Land Use Policy|year=2014| doi= 10.1016/j.landusepol.2014.01.019|volume=39|pages=350–357}}</ref>

In 2000 there were 103,700 farm holdings and in 2010 there were 73,470, or a -29.2% loss in holdings for the region. The total utilised agricultural area (UAA) was {{Convert|1,114,590|ha}} in 2000 and {{Convert|1,064,210|ha}} in 2014 for a loss of 4.5%, indicating a downturn of smaller farm ownership. During this same timeframe there was a 14.5% decrease in the farm labor workforce.<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Agricultural_census_in_Italy#Agricultural_holdings Eurostat]- Retrieved 4 July 2018</ref>

== Government and politics ==
{{Main|Politics of Emilia-Romagna}}
[[File:Sede regione Emilia-Romagna.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Seat of the [[Regional Council of Emilia-Romagna|Regional Assembly of Emilia-Romagna]] in [[Bologna]]]] 
The Regional Government (''Giunta Regionale'') is presided by the President of the Region (''Presidente della Regione''), who is elected for a five-year term. The Regional Government is composed of the President and the Ministers (''Assessori''), of which there are currently twelve including the Vice President and the Under-Secretary for the President's office.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.regione.emilia-romagna.it/giunta|title = Giunta – E-R Il Portale della Regione Emilia-Romagna|publisher = Regione.emilia-romagna.it|access-date = 30 August 2015}}</ref>

Apart from the [[province of Piacenza]], Emilia-Romagna was historically a stronghold of the [[Italian Communist Party]], forming the Italian "Red Quadrilateral"<ref>{{Cite news|work=[[Architects' Journal]]|title=Owen Hatherley's Eurovisionaries: Bologna|date=4 September 2015|url=https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/culture/owen-hatherleys-eurovisionaries-bologna/8688460.article}}</ref> or sometimes "[[Red belt (Italy)|Red Belt]]" called with [[Tuscany]], [[Umbria]] and [[Marche]]. This is probably due to the strength of the anti-fascist resistance around the time of World War II as well as a strong tradition of [[anti-clericalism]] dating from the 19th century, when part of the region belonged to the [[Papal States]]. The strength of the anti-fascist resistance is one of the main factors, along with the effectiveness of trade-unionism, that led to the dominance of the PCI in the region.

Emilia-Romagna has since World War II been a left-wing stronghold, nowadays led by the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]], since its creation in 2007.

Emilia-Romagna is divided into nine provinces. Apart from the creation of the [[Metropolitan City of Bologna]], plans to reduce the number of provinces from nine to four have been dropped.

[[Istat|ISTAT]] estimates the population of Emilia-Romagna was 4,459,577 on 1 January 2019.<ref name="Istat"/> The population density, which was equal to 200 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup> in 2019, is close to the national average. The population of this region is traditionally evenly distributed, with no dominant metropolis but rather a line of medium-sized cities along the [[Via Emilia]], where two thirds of the population and the majority of the industrial production are concentrated. The coast of [[Romagna]] is also densely populated due to the booming seaside tourism in recent decades.

Between 1876 and 1976, about 1.2 million people emigrated from Emilia-Romagna to other countries. {{As of|2008}}, there were 119,369 people from this region living outside Italy, particularly in [[Argentina]], [[Switzerland]], [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Brazil]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museonazionaleemigrazione.it/regioni.php?id=6 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722042834/http://www.museonazionaleemigrazione.it/regioni.php?id=6 |url-status=dead|archive-date=22 July 2011 |title=Museo Nazionale Emigrazione Italiana |publisher=Museonazionaleemigrazione.it |access-date=28 November 2013 }}</ref> {{As of|2008}}, the Italian National Institute of Statistics ([[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]]) estimated that 365,687 foreign-born immigrants lived in Emilia-Romagna, equal to 8.5% of the total regional population.

===Language===
{{Main|Emilian language|Romagnol language}}
Apart from standard [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Emilian language|Emilian]] and [[Romagnolo language|Romagnolo]], two closely related languages that are part of the [[Emiliano-Romagnolo]] [[language family]], are the local languages of Emilia-Romagna. They are [[Romance language|Romance]] [[language]]s spoken in the region, in Northern Marche and other nearby areas such as parts of [[Province of Massa Carrara|Massa-Carrara]], [[Province of Mantua|Mantua]], [[Province of Pavia|Pavia]] and [[Province of Rovigo|Rovigo]] provinces and in [[San Marino]]. The [[Sillaro]] river ({{langx|egl|Séllar}} in Emilian), near the town of [[Castel San Pietro Terme]], is the border between Emilia and Romagna. They belong to the [[Northern Italian]] group within Romance languages (like [[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]], [[Lombard language|Lombard]], [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]] and [[Venetian language|Venetian]]), which is included in the wider group of western Romance languages (including [[French language|French]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]]). They are considered minority languages, structurally separated from Italian by the [[Ethnologue]] and by the ''[[Red Book of Endangered Languages]]'' of [[UNESCO]].

===Agriculture===
In spite of the depth and variety of industrial activities in the region, agriculture has not been eclipsed. Emilia-Romagna is among the leading regions in the country, with farming contributing 5.8% of the gross regional product.{{cn|date=August 2024}} The agricultural sector has aimed for increased competitiveness by means of structural reorganisation and high-quality products, and this has led to the success of marketed brands. [[Cereal]]s, [[potato]]es, [[maize]], [[tomato]]es and [[onion]]s are the most important products, along with [[fruit]] and [[grape]]s for the production of [[wine]] (of which the best known are Emilia's [[Lambrusco]], Bologna's {{ill|Pignoletto|it}}, Romagna's [[Sangiovese]] and white [[Albana (grape)|Albana]]). Alongside cereals, which for centuries remained the first local product, the cultivation of fruit trees has developed (especially peaches, but also apricots, plums, apples and pears).{{cn|date=August 2024}}

[[Cattle breeding|Cattle]] and [[pig]] breeding are also highly developed. Farm [[cooperative]]s have been working along these lines in recent years. With their long tradition in the region there are now about 8,100 cooperatives, generally in the agricultural sector and mainly located in the provinces of [[province of Bologna|Bologna]] (2,160) and [[province of Forlì-Cesena|Forlì-Cesena]] (1,300).<ref name="regportraits1">{{cite web |url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itd5_eco.htm |title=Eurostat |publisher=Circa.europa.eu |access-date=13 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223230313/http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itd5_eco.htm |archive-date=23 February 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Cinema===
[[File:Federico Fellini NYWTS 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Federico Fellini]]]]

Emilia-Romagna has given birth to a number of important filmmakers and actors and was the main setting for numerous important movies. [[Bernardo Bertolucci]] was a native from Parma and his 1976 masterpiece, ''[[1900 (film)|1900]]'', was partially set in Emilia-Romagna. [[Federico Fellini]], a native of Rimini, shot many movies in the region, among them ''[[Amarcord]]''. [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], a native from Bologna, in addition to being a film director, was a poet, writer, and intellectual, who also distinguished himself as an actor, journalist, novelist, playwright, and political figure. [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], a native of Ferrara, shot his 1964 movie ''[[Red Desert (film)|Red Desert]]'' in Ravenna. [[Florestano Vancini]], also from Ferrara, shot there his 1960 film ''[[Long Night in 1943]]''. [[Pupi Avati]], a native of Bologna, shot numerous movies in the region, including the 1976 horror-thriller ''[[The House with Laughing Windows]]''.

===Cuisine and gastronomy===
[[File:Barrels vinegar.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Barrels of [[traditional balsamic vinegar]]]]

Emilia-Romagna is considered one of the richest regions of Italy with regard to its gastronomic and wine-making tradition. The region is known for its egg and filled pasta made with soft wheat flour. [[Bologna]] is notable for pasta dishes like ''[[tortellini]]'', ''[[lasagne verdi|lasagne]]'', ''[[gramigna (pasta)|gramigna]]'' and ''[[tagliatelle]]'' which are found also in many other parts of the region in different declinations.  The [[Romagna]] subregion is known as well for pasta dishes like ''[[garganelli]]'', ''[[strozzapreti]]'', ''[[sfoglia lorda]]'' and ''[[tortelli alla lastra]]''. In the [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]] subregion, except [[Piacenza]] which is heavily influenced by the cuisines of [[Lombardy]], rice is eaten to a lesser extent. ''[[Polenta]]'', a maize-based dish, is common both in Emilia and Romagna. The celebrated [[balsamic vinegar]] is made only in the Emilian cities of [[Modena]] and [[Reggio Emilia]], following legally binding traditional procedures.<ref>Piras, 187.</ref> [[Parmigiano Reggiano]] (Parmesan Cheese) is produced in Reggio Emilia, Parma, Modena and Bologna and is much used in cooking, while [[Grana Padano]] variety is produced in the rest of the region.

[[File:Wheel of 2013 Parmigiano-Reggiano DOP.JPG|thumb|Wheels of Parmigiano Reggiano]]

Although the Adriatic coast is a major fishing area which produces eels and clams, the region produces more meat products, especially pork-based, including Parma's ''[[prosciutto]]'', ''[[culatello]]'' and ''[[Salame Felino]]'', Piacenza's ''[[pancetta]]'', ''[[capicola|coppa]]'' and salami, Bologna's ''[[mortadella]]'' and ''[[salame rosa]]'', Modena's ''[[zampone]]'', ''[[cotechino]]'' and ''[[cappello del prete]]''  and [[Ferrara]]'s ''[[salama da sugo]]''. [[Reggio Emilia]] is the origin of the fresh egg-made pasta ''[[Cappelletti (pasta)|cappelletti]]'' (similar to Bologna's tortellini but differing in size), the typical ''[[erbazzone]]'' a spinach and ''[[Parmigiano Reggiano]]'' salted cake, and ''[[Gnocco Fritto]]'', mixed flour stripes fried in boiling oil, eaten in combination with ham or salami. ''[[Crescentina modenese|Crescentina]]'' is a thin round bread that originates in the Apennines around Modena and is usually filled with ''cunza'' (a spread made from pork lard and flavoured with garlic and rosemary) or with cold cuts, cheese and salty dressings or sweet spreads. Piacenza and Ferrara are also known for some dishes prepared with horse and donkey meat. Regional desserts include ''[[zuppa inglese]]'' (custard-based dessert made with sponge cake and [[Alchermes]] liqueur) and ''[[panpepato]]'' (Christmas cake made with pepper, chocolate, spices, and almonds). An exhaustive list of the most important regional wines should include [[Sangiovese]] from Romagna, [[Lambrusco]] from [[Reggio Emilia]] or [[Modena]], [[Cagnina di Romagna]], [[Gutturnio]] and [[Trebbiano]] from [[Piacenza]].

=== Music ===
Emilia-Romagna gave birth to one of the most important composers in the history of music, [[Giuseppe Verdi]], as well as [[Arturo Toscanini]], one of the most acclaimed conductors of the 20th century, and the operatic tenor [[Luciano Pavarotti]].

The region is well known in Italy for its [[rock and roll|rock]] and [[folk music|folk]] musicians, such as [[Laura Pausini]], [[Raffaella Carrà]], [[Samuele Bersani]], [[Luciano Ligabue]], [[Lucio Dalla]], [[Francesco Guccini]], [[Vasco Rossi]] and [[Zucchero]]. "[[Romagna mia]]", a song written in 1954 by [[Secondo Casadei]], is considered by many as the unofficial anthem of [[Romagna]].{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

== Sport ==

=== Motorsports ===
[[Ferrari]]'s motorsports division [[Scuderia Ferrari]] is also run out of [[Maranello]] in the [[Province of Modena]], the teams' colours being red. Ferrari's Formula One team has won 15 [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' titles]] and 16 [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors' titles]]. The team has also won multiple [[Le Mans 24 Hours]] in sports car racing. The most successful Ferrari driver is German racer [[Michael Schumacher]], who won five consecutive Formula One titles between {{f1|2000}} and {{f1|2004}} with Ferrari, being the first Formula One driver to achieve that milestone. Among other legendary Ferrari drivers include pre-Formula One era [[Tazio Nuvolari]], and in the Formula One era [[Alberto Ascari]], [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[John Surtees]], [[Niki Lauda]] and [[Kimi Räikkönen]] include among drivers to have won the title in a Ferrari car. Another Formula 1 team is based here, [[RB Formula One Team]] in Faenza, the heir of [[Minardi]] and [[Scuderia Toro Rosso]].

[[Ducati Corse]] is the motorsports division of [[Ducati]]'s motorcycle company, being the predominant Italian constructor in [[MotoGP]] and the [[Superbike World Championship]]. Ducati has won two MotoGP titles, with Australian [[Casey Stoner]] in [[2007 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2007]] and with Italian [[Francesco Bagnaia|Pecco Bagnaia]] in [[2022 MotoGP World Championship|2022]]. Stoner is also the most successful rider for the team in MotoGP, having won 23 Grands Prix in his four seasons. Ducati have had multiple World Champions [[Valentino Rossi]] and [[Jorge Lorenzo]] race for the team. In 2017, Emilia-Romagna native [[Andrea Dovizioso]] finished second in the MotoGP championship for Ducati. The team has frequently had at least one Italian rider in its factory team since its entry into the premier class in 2003 at the beginning of the four-stroke engine era. Its first Grand Prix winner was Emilia-Romagna native [[Loris Capirossi]] in the team's inaugural season. Ducati have also won multiple Superbike titles with riders such as [[Carl Fogarty]], [[Troy Bayliss]], and [[Álvaro Bautista|Alvaro Bautista]] being among title winners.

Aside from Dovizioso and Capirossi, high-profile racers such as [[Marco Melandri]] and [[Marco Simoncelli]] have also come out of Emilia-Romagna. Simoncelli died in an accident when he was run over on track in the [[2011 Malaysian motorcycle Grand Prix|2011 Malaysian Grand Prix]] at the age of 24, and was honoured by having the [[Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli|Misano World Circuit]] named after him.

Emilia-Romagna have two major international race circuits; [[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari]] in [[Imola]] and the aforementioned [[Misano World Circuit|circuit]] in [[Misano Adriatico]]. Imola used to host Formula One between 1980 and 2006, under the banner of [[San Marino Grand Prix]] on all but one occasion; as well as hosting two non-championship races in [[1963 Imola Grand Prix|1963]] and [[1979 Dino Ferrari Grand Prix|1979]]. The track was the site for the [[Death of Ayrton Senna|fatal crash]] of three-time world champion [[Ayrton Senna]] on [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix|1 May 1994]], along with a fatal crash the day before of Austrian [[Roland Ratzenberger]]. The track was rebuilt after the tragedies and returned to the calendar in a new guise already the following year. Imola was a happy hunting ground for Emilia-Romagna team Scuderia Ferrari during the era on the re-built track, with Michael Schumacher winning the race five times in front of the home crowd. In [[2020 Formula One World Championship|2020]], Imola returned to the calendar due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] and hosted the [[2020 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix|Emilia Romagna Grand Prix]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Morlidge|first=Matt|date=25 August 2020|title=Nurburgring, Portugal and Imola races added to F1 2020 calendar|url=https://www.skysports.com/f1/news/12433/12035235/nurburgring-portugal-and-imola-races-added-to-f1-2020-calendar|access-date=28 August 2020|website=Sky Sports|language=en}}</ref>
