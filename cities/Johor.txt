'''Johor''' ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|ə|ˈ|h|ɔːr}}; {{IPA-ms|d͡ʒoho(r)}}, also spelled '''Johore''' or historically, '''Jahore''') is a [[States and federal territories of Malaysia|state]] of [[Malaysia]] in the south of the [[Malay Peninsula]]. It borders with [[Pahang]], [[Malacca]] and [[Negeri Sembilan]] to the north. Johor has maritime borders with [[Singapore]] to the south and [[Indonesia]] to the east and west. As of 2023, the state's population is 4.09 million, making it the second most populous state in Malaysia, after [[Selangor]].<ref>{{Cite journal |title=penemuan utama banci penduduk dan perumahan malaysia, 2020 |url=https://www.selangor.gov.my/sabakbernam/resources/PENERBITAN_PENEMUAN_UTAMA_BANCI_PENDUDUK_DAN_PERUMAHAN_MALAYSIA_2020.pdf |journal=Banci 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Johor – Info Malaysia (IIM) Leading Industrial, Commercial, Tourism & Information in Malaysia. |url=https://www.iim.com.my/state-of-malaysia/johor.html |access-date=2023-12-26 |website=www.iim.com.my}}</ref> [[Johor Bahru]] is the capital city and the economic centre of the state, [[Kota Iskandar]] is the state administrative centre and [[Muar (town)|Muar]] serves as the royal capital.

Johor's economy is mainly based on the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|services]] and [[Secondary sector of the economy|manufacturing]] sectors. Its [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) is among the three largest in Malaysia, alongside [[Selangor]] and [[Kuala Lumpur]]. Today, Johor remains the nation's largest trade contributor among all Malaysian states.<ref>{{Cite web |last=BERNAMA |date=2023-08-11 |title=JOHOR RECORDS TOTAL TRADE OF RM563.31 BLN TO SEPTEMBER, REMAINS COUNTRY'S LARGEST TRADE CONTRIBUTOR |url=https://www.bernama.com/en/news.php?id=2242889 |access-date=2023-12-04 |website=BERNAMA |language=en}}</ref> The state is also a major logistics hub in Malaysia, home to the [[Port of Tanjung Pelepas]], the [[List of busiest container ports|15th busiest port in the world]]. [[Johor Bahru]] is also one of the anchor cities of the [[Iskandar Malaysia]] development corridor that covers much of southern Johor, which is the country's first and largest [[special economic zone]] by investment value.

Johor has high diversity in ethnicity, culture, and language. The state is known for its traditional dance of ''[[Zapin]]'' and [[Kuda lumping|Kuda kepang]]. The head of state is the [[Sultan of Johor]], while the head of government is the ''[[Menteri Besar of Johor|Menteri Besar]]''. The government system is closely modelled on the [[Westminster system|Westminster parliamentary system]], with the state administration divided into administrative districts. Islam is the [[state religion]] per the 1895 Constitution of Johor, but other religions can be freely practised. [[Malaysian language|Malay]] is the official language for the state. Johor has highly [[biodiversity|diverse]] tropical [[rainforest]]s and an [[equatorial climate]]. Situated at the southern foothills of the [[Tenasserim Hills]], [[inselbergs]] and [[massifs]] dominate the state's flat landscape, with [[Mount Ledang]] being the highest point.
