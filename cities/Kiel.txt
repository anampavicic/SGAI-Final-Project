'''Kiel''' ({{IPAc-en|k|iː|l}} {{respell|KEEL}}, {{IPA|de|kiːl|lang|Kiel.ogg}}) is the capital and most populous city in the northern [[Germany|German]] state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. With a population of around 250,000, it is Germany's largest city on the [[Baltic Sea]]. It is located on the [[Kieler Förde]] inlet of the [[Bay of Kiel]], and lies in the southeast of the [[Jutland]] Peninsula, on the mouth of the [[Schwentine]] River, approximately {{convert|90|km}} northeast of [[Hamburg]]. In Kiel-[[Holtenau]] begins the world's busiest artificial waterway, the [[Kiel Canal]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kusch |first1=Regina |title=Eröffnung des Nord-Ostsee-Kanals Die meistbefahrene künstliche Wasserstraße der Welt |url=https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/eroeffnung-des-nord-ostsee-kanals-die-meistbefahrene.871.de.html?dram:article_id=479034 |website=Deutschlandfunk |date=21 June 2020 |access-date=28 January 2021}}</ref> that connects the Baltic to the [[North Sea]]. Most of Kiel is part of [[Holstein]]. The boroughs north of the [[Schwentine]] also belong to [[Wagria]], while those north of the [[Kiel Canal]] are historically part of [[Southern Schleswig]].

Kiel is one of Germany's major maritime centres, known for a variety of international [[sailing]] events, including the annual [[Kiel Week]], which is the biggest sailing event in the world. Kiel is also known for the [[Kiel mutiny|Kiel Mutiny]], when sailors refused orders to prepare to engage the British Navy in the last weeks of [[World War I]], sparking the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|German Revolution]] which led to the abdication of the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser]] and the formation of the [[Weimar Republic]]. The Olympic sailing competitions of the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936]] and the [[1972 Summer Olympics#Venues|1972 Summer Olympics]] were held in the [[Bay of Kiel]].<ref>{{cite web

Kiel has also been one of the traditional homes of the [[German Navy]]'s [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] fleet, and continues to be a major high-tech [[shipbuilding]] centre. Located in Kiel is the [[GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel|GEOMAR – Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel]] at the [[University of Kiel]], that was founded in 1665. Kiel is an important sea transport hub, and a number of passenger ferries to [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Lithuania]] and other countries operate from here. Moreover, today [[Port of Kiel]] is a popular destination for [[cruise ship]]s touring the Baltic Sea.

Kiel's [[recorded history]] began in the 13th century. Before then, in the eighth century, it was a Danish village. Until 1864 it was administered by [[Denmark]] in [[personal union]]. In 1866 the city was annexed by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and in 1871 it became part of Germany.

Kiel was one of the founding cities of the original [[European Green Capital Award]] in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|title=European Green Capitals|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/europeangreencapital/about-the-award/index.html|publisher=European Commission|access-date=16 May 2015}}</ref> In 2005 Kiel's [[GDP]] per capita was [[Euro|€]]35,618, which is well above [[Germany]]'s national average, and 159% of the [[European Union]]'s average.<ref name="GDP per person 2005 in Euro">{{Cite web|url=http://www.insm-staedteranking.de/niv_i_bruttoinlandsprodukt-je-einwohner.html?s_id=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227182439/http://www.insm-staedteranking.de/niv_i_bruttoinlandsprodukt-je-einwohner.html?s_id=1|url-status=dead|title=GDP per person 2005 in Euro|archive-date=December 27, 2008}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Moresources|section|date=August 2022}}
=== Middle Ages ===
The city of Kiel was founded in 1233 as ''Holstenstadt tom Kyle'' by Count [[Adolf IV of Holstein]], and granted [[Lübeck law|Lübeck city rights]] in 1242 by Adolf's eldest son, [[John I, Count of Holstein-Kiel|John I]] of Schauenburg. As a part of Holstein, Kiel belonged to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and was situated only a few kilometres south of the [[Denmark|Danish]] border.<ref>{{cite web

[[File:Kiel Braun-Hogenberg.jpg|thumb|left|Kiel in the 16th century]]
The capital of the county (later duchy) of [[Holstein]], Kiel was a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] from 1284 until it was expelled in 1518 for harbouring [[piracy|pirates]]. The ''Kieler Umschlag'' ([[trade fair]]), first held in 1431, became the central market for goods and money in thr Duchy of Holstein. It began to decline {{Circa|1850}} and ceased in 1900.

=== Modern times ===
The [[University of Kiel]] was founded on 29 September 1665 by [[Christian Albert, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp|Christian Albert]], Duke of [[Holstein-Gottorp]]. A number of important scholars, including [[Theodor Mommsen]], [[Felix Jacoby]], [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Max Planck]], studied or taught there.
[[File:SatSchleswigHolstein Hamburg.jpg|thumb|Schleswig-Holstein with Kiel Fjord at the Baltic Coast]]

From 1773 to 1864, the town belonged to the king of [[Denmark]]. However, because the king ruled Holstein as a fief of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] only through a [[personal union]], the town was not incorporated as part of Denmark proper. Thus Kiel belonged to Germany, but it was ruled by the Danish king. Even though the empire was abolished in 1806, the Danish king continued to rule Kiel only through his position as Duke of Holstein, which became a member of the [[German Confederation]] in 1815. When [[Schleswig]] and Holstein rebelled against Denmark in 1848 (the [[First Schleswig War]]), Kiel became the capital of Schleswig-Holstein until the Danish victory in 1850.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hook |first=Alison |title=Kiel, Germany – Coventry's twin towns and cities |url=https://www.coventry.gov.uk/directory-record/49243/kiel-germany |access-date=2024-01-30 |website=Coventry City Council |language=en}}</ref>

During the [[Second Schleswig War]] in 1864, Kiel and the rest of the duchies of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]] were conquered by a [[German Confederation]] alliance of the [[Austrian Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. After the war, Kiel was briefly administered by both the Austrians and the Prussians, but the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866 led to the formation of the [[Province of Schleswig-Holstein]] and the annexation of Kiel by Prussia in 1867. On 24 March 1865 King [[William I, German Emperor|William I]] based Prussia's Baltic Sea fleet in Kiel instead of [[Gdańsk|Danzig (Gdańsk)]]. The [[Kaiserliche Werft Kiel|Imperial shipyard Kiel]] was established in 1867 in the town.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

When William I of Prussia became Emperor [[William I, German Emperor|William I]] of the [[German Empire]] in 1871, he designated Kiel and [[Wilhelmshaven]] as ''Reichskriegshäfen'' ("Imperial War Harbours"). The [[Kieler Yacht-Club|Kiel Yacht Club]] was established in 1887 with [[Prince Henry of Prussia (1862-1929)|Prince Henry of Prussia]] as its patron. Emperor Wilhelm II became its [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]] in 1891.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

Because of its new role as Germany's main naval base, Kiel very quickly increased in size in the following years, from 18,770 in 1864 to about 200,000 in 1910. Much of the old town centre and other surroundings were levelled and redeveloped to provide for the growing city. The [[Trams in Kiel|Kiel tramway network]], opened in 1881, had been enlarged to 10 lines, with a total route length of {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}}, before the end of the [[First World War]].{{cn|date=August 2022}}

Kiel was the site of the [[Kiel mutiny|sailors' mutiny]] which led to the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|German Revolution]] in late 1918. Just before the end of the First World War, the German fleet stationed at Kiel was ordered to sail out for a last great battle with the [[Royal Navy]]. The sailors, who thought of it as a suicide mission which would have no effect on the outcome of the war, decided they had nothing to lose and refused to obey orders. They took over Kiel and then spread out to other north German ports, sparking the revolution which led to the abolition of the monarchy and the creation of the [[Weimar Republic]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jones |first=Mark |date=19 May 2016 |editor-last=Daniel |editor-first=Ute |editor2-last=Gatrell |editor2-first=Peter |editor3-last=Janz |editor3-first=Oliver |editor4-last=Jones |editor4-first=Heather |editor5-last=Keene |editor5-first=Jennifer |editor6-last=Kramer |editor6-first=Alan |editor7-last=Nasson |editor7-first=Bill |title=Kiel Mutiny |url=https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/kiel_mutiny |access-date=26 April 2024 |website=1914–1918-online.

There were several bombing raids of the port area during the period 20 February – 20 April 1945 which successfully eliminated many [[U-boats]], and the few large warships (cruisers [[German cruiser Admiral Hipper|Hipper]], [[German pocket battleship Admiral Scheer|Scheer]], and [[German cruiser Köln|Köln]]) still afloat at that time.

Like other heavily bombed German cities, the city was rebuilt after the war. In 1946, Kiel was named the seat of government for [[Schleswig-Holstein]], and it officially became the state's capital in 1952.{{cn|date=August 2022}}
Today, Kiel is once again an important maritime centre of Germany, with high-tech shipbuilding, [[submarine]] construction and one of the world's largest ocean research centers, the GEOMAR. Regular ferries to Scandinavia and Lithuania, as well as the largest sailing event in the world called the [[Kiel Week]] (Kieler Woche) in German and The Kiel Regatta in English. The ''Kieler Umschlag'' is another festival, which has been taking place again since 1975. Kiel is also home to a large service sector and a number of research institutions including the [[University of Kiel]], which is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious university in the state.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

=== Districts ===
[[File:Kiel Population Density.svg|thumb|Image showing the population density of Kiel by district. Data from 2010.]]Kiel has about 40 districts, but there is no standard division. The districts are traditionally grouped into 30 boroughs (Stadtteile)[https://www.kiel.de/de/kiel_zukunft/statistik_kieler_zahlen/_kleinraeumige_berichte/Statistischer_Bericht_Nr._269_-_Kieler_Stadtteile_2019.pdf]. Another, more recent structure summarizes the districts in 18 political districts (Ortsteile)[https://www.kiel.de/de/kiel_zukunft/statistik_kieler_zahlen/_kleinraeumige_berichte/Statistischer_Bericht_Nr._270_-_Kieler_Ortsteile_2019.pdf]. The city has 25 electoral districts.

The biggest districts, by population, are Gaarden (23,000), Mettenhof (20,000) and Elmschenhagen (17,000). Gaarden, located at the southern end of the fjord, is a traditional working-class district that used to be home to mainly shipyard workers. Mettenhof is a large housing estate (satellite town) that was built in the 1960s and 1970s on the western outskirts of the city.
The city districts of Düsternbrook, Schreventeich, Ravensberg and Blücherplatz, north of the city centre, are popular places to live with many 19th century buildings, villas and tree-lined streets. The government offices, ministries and parliament of the state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] are also mainly based in these neighbourhoods, particularly Düsternbrook. In contrast to the heavy bomb damage inflicted on the central parts of the city during the [[Second World War]], most of the residential areas were not severely damaged. Hence, Kiel's more modern-style inner city and Kiel's more historic/elaborate residential areas stand in architectural contrast to one another.
There are plans for large-scale improvement and building efforts for the inner city, providing better pavements, better access to and view of the waterfront, and a generally more attractive feel to the place. These plans, most notably the "Kleiner Kiel Kanal", a restoration of a historic canal that was filled in to make place for road infrastructure, are to be implemented in the next few years.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Kleiner Kiel Kanal|url = http://www.kleiner-kiel-kanal.de/|website = kleiner-kiel-kanal.de|access-date = 2015-08-27}}</ref>

===Main sights===
[[File:Geistkaempfer Barlach Kiel.jpg|thumb|left|''Geistkämpfer'' in front of the [[St. Nikolai, Kiel|Nikolaikirche]], by [[Ernst Barlach]]]]
The oldest building in the city is the 13th century ''[[St. Nikolai, Kiel|Church of St. Nicholas]]'', which has a sculpture by [[Ernst Barlach]] in front of it called ''Geistkämpfer''.

Kiel is [[Schleswig-Holstein]]'s largest city, and therefore Kiel's shopping district is a major attraction, and will see further improvement and renovation efforts in the upcoming years. Kiel's Holstenstraße (Holsten Street) is one of the longest shopping streets in Germany. The [[Seat of local government|Rathaus]] (Town Hall), which was built in 1911, has an operating [[paternoster lift]] and the design of its tower was based on one in [[Venice]]. The square in front of it is bordered by a lake and the [[Opernhaus Kiel]] (Kiel Opera House). There are also a number of lakes and parks in the city centre, such as Schrevenpark. There are two [[botanical garden]]s, the [[Old Botanical Garden, Kiel|Old Botanical Garden]] and the [[Botanischer Garten der Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel]] (or New Botanical Garden).

As Kiel is situated near the sea, the beaches to the north of Kiel, such as [[Strande]], Kiel-[[Schilksee]], [[Möltenort]] and [[Laboe]], are also popular places to visit in spring and summer.

[[Kiel Week]], also known in English as the Kiel Regatta, is the largest sailing event in the world and takes place every year in the last full week in June. Many thousands of boats and ships of all kinds and eras take part in the parade. Kiel Week is also a festival, ''[[Volksfest]]'' and fair as well as a maritime event. There are a number of yachting and sailing clubs in picturesque settings.

Kiel also features a number of museums, including zoological, geological, historical, fine art, industrial and military museums. Notable is the Stadt- und Schifffahrtsmuseum Warleberger Hof (City and Maritime Museum), which belongs to the association ''[[Museen am Meer]]''. In addition to preserving architecture from the 16th century and historic rooms with painted stucco ceilings, it displays urban and cultural exhibits of the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref name="Stadtmuseum">[http://www.kiel.de/kultur/museen/stadtmuseum.php "Kieler Stadtmuseum Warleberger Hof"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826155847/http://www.kiel.de/kultur/museen/stadtmuseum.php |date=2009-08-26 }}, City of Kiel webpage, in German</ref> Particularly intriguing is the history of the carnival in Kiel.<ref name="Stadtmuseum"/> 

The [[Kiel Maritime Museum|Schifffahrtsmuseum]] is in the former fish market building in the harbour.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

Laboe is home to the [[Laboe Naval Memorial]] and the [[Second World War]] submarine {{GS|U-995||2}}, which are both popular tourist sites.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

Kiel has a population of 247,000. In 1946, when Kiel became the capital of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] state, it had about population of 214,000. Kiel is not only the largest German city located on the sea, but the only state capital located on the sea. In the 1950s Kiel, with its marine port, attracted members of the navy. Kiel had its highest peak of population in 1973 at 273,000. The population declined since then. Many people moved away from this city and Kiel became very poor and had a big problems with unemployed people at that time. Kiel is now a city with universities and active marine stations which attracts many young students and marines to Kiel.

== Culture ==
=== Sports ===
There are a number of sports venues in Kiel, most notably the [[Wunderino Arena]] (formerly known as Baltic Sea Hall or ''Ostseehalle''), which is the home ground of one of the most successful [[team handball]] clubs in the world and multiple German champion, [[THW Kiel]]. [[Holstein Kiel]], an [[association football]] club, which plays at [[Holstein-Stadion]], will play in the [[Bundesliga]] in the 2024–2025 season for the first time in club's history.

== Education and scientific research ==
The [[University of Kiel]] (German: Christian-Albrechts-Universität) was founded by Duke [[Christian Albert, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp|Christian Albrecht]] in 1665. It is the only full university of Schleswig-Holstein, with about 27.000 students. Partly linked to the University Kiel are other independent research facilities such as the [[German National Library of Economics]] – Leibniz Informationcenter for Economy, the [[Kiel Institute for the World Economy]], the [[GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel]] and the research institute of the [[Bundeswehr]] for water sound and geophysics. Besides these there are other educational institutions such as the [[Fachhochschule Kiel]] (founded in 1969) and the Muthesius School of Arts (founded in 1907). The projects Murmann School of Global Management and Economics and Multimedia Campus Kiel were ultimately unsuccessful.{{clarify|date=July 2021}} The Wirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein offers besides advanced training at the Berufsakademie dual study courses for economists, business information specialists and industrial engineers.

Noteworthy as departmental research institute is the federal institute for dairy research which was merged into the Max-Rubner-Institut together with other institutions in 2004. The state capital Kiel is a corporative sponsoring member of the [[Max Planck Society]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mpg.de/787880/Korporativ_Foerdernde_Mitglieder_MPG.pdf|title=Liste der korporativ fördernden Mitglieder der MPG, PDF|date=2011-01-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114111116/http://www.mpg.de/787880/Korporativ_Foerdernde_Mitglieder_MPG.pdf|archive-date=2011-01-14|url-status=dead|access-date=2017-09-23}}</ref>

The [[ARGE-SH]], the oldest research institution of the republic of Germany, has its headquarters in Kiel.

There are twelve [[Gymnasium (Germany)|gymnasiums]] in Kiel, of which the Kieler Gelehrtenschule, founded in 1320 as a humanistic gymnasium, is the oldest. Other secondary schools include the Gymnasium Elmschenhagen and the Max-Planck-Schule with a focus on natural sciences. There are many comprehensive schools – partially with secondary schools – all over the city area, as well as private schools.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
[[File:Holsten strasse Kiel.JPG|thumb|The ''Holstenstraße'' is one of the longest shopping streets in Germany — Kiel is the largest city in the state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]].]]
Kiel's economy is dominated by the service sector, transport and maritime industries. Kiel is also one of the major ports of the [[German Navy]], and a leading centre of German high-tech military and civil shipbuilding. Kiel is the home of [[Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft]], a [[shipyard]] founded in 1838 famed for its construction of [[submarines]]. HDW built the first German submarine ''[[Brandtaucher]]'' in 1850, and is today a subsidiary of [[ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems]], the leading German group of shipyards.
