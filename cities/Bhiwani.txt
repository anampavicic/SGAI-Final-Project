== History ==
===Etymology===
Bhiwani is a corrupted form of ''Bhani''. The town was founded by a  Rajput chief called Neem Singh. His wife named ''Bhani'' once saved his life from treachery. Consequently, he named the town after her. The corrupted name of the town from ''Bhani'' to ''Bhiani'' (natives still use this pronunciation) eventually came to be known as ''Bhiwani''.<ref name=hargazc1>[http://revenueharyana.gov.in/Portals/0/hr-geg-app-i.pdf 2001], [http://revenueharyana.gov.in/Portals/0/hr-gaz-ch-5.pdf Chapter-V] of [http://revenueharyana.gov.in/Researchers/Haryana-State-Gazetteer-Volume-I Haryana State Gazetteer Vol-I], Revenue Dept of Haryana, Chapter-V.</ref> Other [[oral tradition]] avers that the town is named after the goddess [[Bhavani]], the wife of Lord [[Shiva]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://haryanatourism.gov.in/Bhiwani-at-a-glance |title=At a glance |website=haryanatourism.gov.in |access-date=19 April 2018}}</ref>
