Administratively, the city consists of a central island, an airport island, and four other islands presided over by the Malé City Council.

Traditionally it was the King's Island, from where the ancient [[List of sultans of the Maldives|royal dynasties]] ruled and where the palace was located. The city was then called ''Mahal''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mohamed |first=Naseema |title=Names of Maldives |url=http://www.qaumiyyath.gov.mv/docs/whitepapers/history/Names%20of%20Maldives.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407040311/http://www.qaumiyyath.gov.mv/docs/whitepapers/history/Names |archive-date=7 April 2016 |access-date=23 May 2015 |website=National Centre for Linguistic and Historical Research}}</ref> Formerly it was a walled city surrounded by fortifications and gates (''doroshi''). The Royal Palace (''Gan'duvaru'') was destroyed along with the picturesque forts (''koshi'') and bastions (''buruzu'') when the city was remodelled under President [[Ibrahim Nasir]]'s rule in the aftermath of the abolition of the monarchy in 1968. However, some buildings remained, namely, the [[Malé Friday Mosque]]. In the last few decades, the island has been considerably expanded in size through [[land reclamation]]. Over the years, Malé has been the center of political protests and milestone events.

==Overview==
[[File:Male- the capital of Maldives.jpg|thumb|left|Malé in 2022, with the new bridge to the airport]]
Although Malé is geographically located in [[Kaafu Atoll]], administratively it is not considered part of it. 

===Islands of Malé City===
# [[Malé|Malé Central Island]]
# [[Hulhulé]] (Airport Island)
# [[Hulhumalé]]
# [[Villingili (Vilimalé)|Vilimalé]]
# [[Thilafushi]]
# [[Gulhi|Gulhifalhu]]

The central part of the city is formed by the island of Malé. Five more islands form part of the city which includes [[Hulhulé]], [[Hulhumalé]], [[Villingili (Vilimalé)|Vilimalé]], Gulhifalhu and [[Thilafushi]]. 

A commercial harbour is located on the central island and serves as the heart of all commercial activities in the country. Velana International Airport is located on the Island of Hulhulé.<ref name="Pub-173">{{Cite book|author=National Imagery and Mapping Agency (US) |year=2002 |chapter=Sector 5.

The central island is heavily urbanised, with the built-up area taking up essentially its entire landmass.<ref name="Pub-173" /> Slightly less than one third of the nation's population lives in the capital city, and the population has increased from 20,000 people in 1987 to 100,000 people in 2006. Many [[Maldivians]] and foreign workers living in other parts of the country find themselves in occasional short term residence on the island since it is the centre of administration and bureaucracy. Most of the population of Malé live in small houses or apartment complexes, often shared with external family or roommates. This led to the development of Hulhumalé and the extension to Phase 2. 

The Indian expatriate community in the Maldives stands as the second-largest, comprising around 27,000 individuals. Among them, a substantial portion consists of construction workers, doctors, nurses, health professionals, and teachers, who play vital roles in the Maldivian infrastructure, healthcare and education sectors. Additionally, Indian and Bangladeshi nationals contribute significantly as skilled workers, alongside a sizable presence of unskilled laborers, as well as other professionals and members of the business community.<ref>{{Cite web |date=Jul 2022 |title=India‐Maldives Bilateral Relations |url=https://mea.gov.in/Portal/ForeignRelation/India-Maldives_2022.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230502005830/https://mea.gov.in/Portal/ForeignRelation/India-Maldives_2022.pdf |archive-date=2 May 2023 |access-date=21 July 2023 |website=[[Ministry of External Affairs (India)]]}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of the Maldives}}
The whole island group, the Maldives, is named after its capital. The word "Maldives" means "the islands (dives) of Malé".<ref>Caldwell, Comparative Dravidian Grammar, pp. 27–28</ref>

The first settlers in the Maldivian islands were [[Dravidian people]]<ref>Xavier Romero-Frias, The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom</ref> who arrived from the neighboring shores of the [[ancient Tamil country|modern Indian subcontinent and coastal Ceylon]]. Comparative studies of Maldivian linguistic, oral, and other cultural traditions, in addition to [[folklore]], point to a strong Dravidian influence on Maldivian society, centered in Malé, from ancient times. The [[Giraavaru people]] of [[Giraavaru (Kaafu Atoll)|Giraavaru]] claim descent from the first Tamil settlers of the Maldives.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Maloney, Clarence|year=1995|title=Where Did the Maldives People Come From?|journal=IIAS Newsletter|publisher=International Institute for Asian Studies|issue=5|url=http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/iiasn5/insouasi/maloney.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020129221500/http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/iiasn5/insouasi/maloney.html|archive-date=29 January 2002|url-status=dead|access-date=22 June 2008}}</ref>

It is said that early Tamil settlers called the islands ''Maalaitivu'', which means Garland Islands or Chain Islands. Early records also indicate that the island was called "''Athamana Huraa''"  prior to being named Malé. According to regional lore, Giraavaru fishermen used to go regularly to a certain large sandbank (''finolhu'') at the southern end of their atoll to clean tuna fish after a good catch. Owing to the large amount of tuna fish offal and blood, the waters around that sandbank looked like a big pool of blood ("maa ley gandeh": "maa" from the [[Sanskrit]] मह "maha", meaning ''big'', and "lē" ''blood''). Traditionally the first inhabitants of the Maldives, which include the Giravaru people, did not have kings. They lived in a simple society and were ruled by local headmen.{{citation needed|date=August 2024}}

However, one day, a prince from the subcontinent called Koimala arrived in the Malé Atoll sailing from the North on a big ship. The people of Giraavaru spotted his vessel from afar and welcomed him. They allowed Prince Koimala to settle on that large sandbank in the midst of the waters tainted with fish blood. Trees were planted on the sandbank and it is said that the first tree that grew on it was the [[papaya]] tree. (However, this could refer to any tree that bears edible fruit as the archaic Dhivehi word, and [[Mahal language|Mahal]] word in modern times, for fruit (''falhoa'') was the same as that for the papaya.<ref>''A Concise Etymological Vocabulary of Dhivehi Language''. Hasan A. Maniku. Speedmark. Colombo. 2000</ref>) As time went by, the local islanders accepted the rule of this Northern Prince. A palace was built and the island was formally named Maa-le (Malé), while the nearest island was named Hulhu-le.{{citation needed|date=August 2024}}

The names of the main four wards or divisions of Malé Island are said to have been given by the original Giraavaru fishermen: Maafannu from ''maa'' (big) and ''fannu'' (a place where a village path meets the sea), Henveiru from ''en-beyru'' (out where fishermen got their bait), Galolhu from ''galu-olhu'' (stone groove) and, Macchangolhi from ''mathi-angolhi'' (windward path-fork).{{citation needed|date=August 2024}}

In early foreign sources, Malé was called Ambria or Mahl.{{citation needed|date=August 2024}} For the Maldivians, it was Fura Malé, i.e. "Malé the Pre-Eminent".<ref name="furamale">{{Cite web |last=Mohamed |first=Naseema |date=7 February 2008 |title=Fura Malé |url=http://www.qaumiyyath.gov.mv/docs/whitepapers/history/Fura%20Male.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221026174425/http://www.qaumiyyath.gov.mv/docs/whitepapers/history/Fura%20Male.pdf |archive-date=26 October 2022 |access-date=21 May 2024 |website=National Centre for Linguistics and Historical Research}}</ref>

When [[Ibn Battuta]] traveled to Malé in 1343 (in {{langx|ar|المَحَل|al-Maḥal}} thus the entire Maldivian islands were ذِيبَةُ المَحَل ''Dhībat-ul-Maḥal''<ref>{{Cite book|page=197-8|title=The Rehla Of Ibn Battuta (India, Maldive Islands and Ceylon)|editor=Mahdi Husain|year=1953|location=Baroda|publisher=Oriental Institute}}</ref>), he provided a rather extensive description of the city as well as the Islands of the Maldives overall. He mentioned that the Queen, [[Khadijah of the Maldives|Rehendhi Khadeeja]], had a residence in Malé, which from its description may be assimilated to the same palace of the later sultan rulers, in the centre of the island.<ref>ibid., pp. 204-5.</ref> Within the palace compounds, several pits contained stores of [[cowrie]] shells, ready to be traded. [[Ibn Battuta]] also mentioned several mosques, built in wood.<ref name=furamale/>

Malé was fortified in the 17th century by the sultan [[Muhammad Imaduddin I|Muhammad Imaduddin]], who built walls on the north, east and west side of the island.
An inner harbour was used by fishing vessels and small [[Dhoni (fishing vessel)|dhonis]], while larger vessels had to anchor in the outer harbour, between the islands of Vilingili and Hulhule. The island covered less than one square mile in size, and was surrounded by a shallow lagoon.<ref name=furamale/>

Malé had 2,148 inhabitants in 1888, but population growth soon led to the search for new spaces for housing. The old forts and decrepit walls were dismantled in 1925–1927 under the reign of [[Muhammad Shamsuddeen III]], to be rebuilt on a smaller scale. Roads were also widened and straightened. Former large cemeteries had also been cleared out, to achieve more housing space.

The Royal Palace (''Gan'duvaru'') was destroyed along with the picturesque forts (''koshi'') and bastions (''buruzu'') when the city was remodelled under President [[Ibrahim Nasir]]'s rule in the aftermath of the abolition of the monarchy in 1968. Only the National Museum building, residence of the last sultan, as well as the [[Malé Friday Mosque]], remain.
Malé's residents soon grew to 11,453 by 1967 and 29,522 by 1977. In order to cater for the growing population, by 1986 the shallow lagoon around Malé was reclaimed.<ref name=furamale/>

The most revered place in Malé is the [[Medhu Ziyaaraiy]], across the street from the [[Malé Friday Mosque]]: the tomb of Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari, considered to have converted the Maldives to Islam in 1153.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Malé has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (''Am'') under the [[Köppen climate classification]].{{cn|date=September 2024}} The city features a mix of both [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s, with the wet season lasting from April through January and the drier season covering the months of February and March. Unlike a number of cities with this climate, Malé experiences relatively consistent temperatures throughout the course of the year, with an average high of {{convert|30|C|disp=or}} and an average low of {{Convert|26.5|C|1|disp=or}}, which is equivalent to many equatorial cities' average year-round daily mean. The city averages slightly more than {{convert|1900|mm|in|0|disp=or}} of precipitation annually. The temperature is constantly high year-round due in part to the Maldives having the lowest median elevation anywhere in the world.{{cn|date=May 2024}}

===Subdivisions===
The city is divided into six divisions, four of which are on Malé Island: Henveiru, Galolhu, Maafannu and MacchanGoalhi.

The island of Malé is the [[List of islands by population density|eighth most densely populated island in the world]], and it is the [[List of islands by population|160th most populous island]] in the world. Since there is no surrounding countryside, all infrastructure has to be located in the city itself. Water is provided from desalinated ground water; the water works pumps brackish water from {{Convert|50|-|60|m|abbr=on}} deep wells in the city and desalinates that using [[reverse osmosis]].<ref name="WS-FAQ">{{Cite web |author= |title=Malé Water & Sewage FAQ |url=http://www.mwsc.com.mv/faqs/faq.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111101942/http://www.mwsc.com.mv/faqs/faq.shtml |archive-date=11 January 2008 |website=Male' Water and Sewerage Company}}</ref> Electric power is generated in the city using [[Diesel generator|diesel]] generators.<ref>{{Cite web |author= |title=Corporate Profile |url=http://www.stelco.com.mv/about.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116203837/http://www.stelco.com.mv/about.html |archive-date=16 November 2007 |website=State Electric Company Limited}}</ref> Sewage is pumped unprocessed into the sea.<ref name="WS-FAQ" /> Solid waste is transported to nearby islands, where it is used to fill in lagoons.

Many government buildings and agencies are located on the waterfront. [[Velana International Airport]] is on adjacent [[Hulhulé Island]] which includes a seaplane base for internal transportation. Several land reclamation projects have expanded the harbour.

==Economy==
[[File:Malé Detail.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Malé]]
[[Tourism in the Maldives|Tourism]] is the largest industry in the Maldives, accounting for 28% of GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts. The GDP per capita expanded by 265% in the 1980s and a further 115% in the 1990s. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes. Malé, the capital, has many tourist attractions and nearby resorts. [[Maldivian (airline)|Maldivian]], the airline of the Maldives, has its head office in Malé,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Contact Us |url=https://maldivian.aero/contact/ |access-date=21 May 2024 |website=[[Maldivian (airline)]] |quote=Corporate Head Office, Ground Floor, Dar Al-Eiman Building, Majeedhee Magu, Male, Zip Code 20345, Maldives}}</ref> as does the airline [[FlyMe (Maldivian airline)|Villa Air]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Help & Support |url=https://villaair.aero/help-support |access-date=21 May 2024 |website=[[Flyme (Villa Air)]]}}</ref>

The central harbour and port of the Maldives is located in Malé, the centre for all commercial activities. The Maldives Transport and Contracting Company (MTCC) is formed in 1980 to contribute towards the development of infrastructure and transport service in the Maldives. The port is part of the [[21st Century Maritime Silk Road]] that runs from the Chinese coast via the [[Suez Canal]] to the Mediterranean, there to the Upper Adriatic region with its rail connections to [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=10 September 2014 |title=Chinese president wins Maldives backing for ‘maritime silk route’ |url=https://www.arabnews.com/node/630676/%7B%7B |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210715094140/https://www.arabnews.com/node/630676/%7B%7B |archive-date=15 July 2021 |access-date=21 May 2024 |work=[[Arab News]] |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=18 December 2014 |title=Maldives signs up for China's Maritime Silk Road |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/maldives-signs-up-for-chinas-maritime-silk-road/articleshow/45564985.cms |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210207135504/https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/maldives-signs-up-for-chinas-maritime-silk-road/articleshow/45564985.cms |archive-date=7 February 2021 |access-date=21 May 2024 |work=[[The Economic Times]] |agency=[[Press Trust of India]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Patranobis |first=Sutirtho |date=15 September 2014 |title=Xi wins Malé’s backing for ‘maritime silk route’ |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/world/xi-wins-male-s-backing-for-maritime-silk-route/story-4XLGcytty7Za3g2CmBzzDN.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210715094128/https://www.hindustantimes.com/world/xi-wins-male-s-backing-for-maritime-silk-route/story-4XLGcytty7Za3g2CmBzzDN.html |archive-date=15 July 2021 |access-date=21 May 2024 |work=[[Hindustan Times]]}}</ref>

==Transport==
[[File:Male street.jpg|thumb|Street level view of Malé city]]
===Road===
Each of the islands of Malé is served by a dense network of paved roads, which are named ''magu'' (road or street), ''hingun'' and ''goalhi'' (small road or alley). Road traffic is heavy, especially on Malé Island.

Malé and [[Hulhulé Island]] are linked by the [[Sinamalé Bridge]], which was opened to traffic in October 2018, while Hulhulé and [[Hulhumalé]] are linked via a causeway, thus allowing the road networks of the three islands to be connected.

==== Public transport ====
[[File:Male City Aerial, The Capital city of Maldives - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Malé, 2014]]
[[File:Aerial view of the Sinamalé Bridge.jpg|left|thumb|Sinamalé Bridge, open since 2018]]
Public transport in Malé primarily consists of 3 [[minibus]] lines that run through the city, and connecting the Greater Malé region to the main island. All the routes are operated by [[Raajje Transport Link (RTL)]]. These busses go through the wider roads through the city. Children under 18, people with special needs and people above 65 years of age ride for free.

The Orchid Route (R10), the Ameenee Route (R11) and the Sosun Route (R12). The routes are named after the main roads that the minibus drives through in Malé, being ''Orchid Magu'', ''Ameenee'' ''Magu and Sosun Magu''. The Malé system has a total of 41 stops, of which R10 and R11 stop at 20 each, while R12 stops at 8. All 3 routes go through ''Majeedhee Magu'', in the centre of the city.

R11 to R9 are various routes connecting Malé to [[Hulhumalé]] and [[Velana International Airport]]. These busses are much larger, and in late 2020, began operating [[double-decker bus]]ses to Hulhumalé. The busses move between the islands using the [[Sinamalé Bridge]].

R13 Is an internal minibus route located internally within [[Villingili (Vilimalé)|Vilimalé]], and goes through 13 stops. It uses much smaller electrical-powered busses along with the Sosun Route (R12).<ref>{{Cite news |last=Faaiq |first=Ali |date=November 7, 2022 |title=Electric busses brought for RTL minibus fleet |url=https://timesofaddu.com/2022/11/07/electric-busses-brought-for-rtl-minibus-fleet/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231126020548/https://timesofaddu.com/2022/11/07/electric-busses-brought-for-rtl-minibus-fleet/ |archive-date=26 November 2023 |access-date=26 November 2023 |work=The Times of Addu}}</ref>

===Air===
[[File:Landing Runway 18 (2121588367).jpg|left|thumb|Velana International Airport]]
[[File:Malé im Landeanflug.jpg|thumb|Main runway of Velana International Airport]]
[[Velana International Airport]] is located on nearby Hulhulé and is the city's airport as well as the principal airport in Maldives. With the opening of the [[Sinamalé Bridge]], the airport is now accessible from Malé by road. Prior to the opening of the bridge, transport between the airport and Malé was by a frequent ferry service. Hulhulé and Hulhumalé have been connected via a causeway since the development of Hulhumalé, allowing the airport to be accessed by road from the latter.

===Inter-island transport===
As Malé, Hulhulé and [[Hulhumalé]] are now linked by roads, inter-island travel between the three islands can be done by road. For the other islands, inter-island transport is by ferry.

===Port===
[[File:Port of Malé.jpg|thumb|Port of Malé]]
Malé island has a port that allows cargo vessels to dock.

== Government ==
[[File:Malé Maldives (1).jpg|thumb|Coast of Malé]]
=== City Council ===
Malé City Council is the [[local government]] body responsible for the governance of the city of Malé. The council was created in 2011, with the enactment of the Decentralization Bill. The city is divided into 18 political [[ward (politics)|wards]] each with one councillor.

In the Local Council Elections in 2021, the mayor was elected for the first time ever, with [[Mohamed Muizzu]] being elected to the position.
