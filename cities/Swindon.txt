'''Swindon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|w|ɪ|n|d|ən|audio=en-uk-Swindon.ogg}}) is a large town in [[Wiltshire]], England. At the time of the 2021 Census the population of the built-up area was 183,638, making it the largest settlement in the county.<ref name=citypopulation/> Located in [[South West England]], Swindon lies on the [[M4 corridor]], 71 miles (114km) to the west of London and 36 miles (57 km) to the east of [[Bristol]]. The [[Cotswolds]] lie just to the town's north and the [[North Wessex Downs]] to its south.

Recorded in the 1086 [[Domesday Book]] as ''Suindune'', the arrival of the [[Great Western Railway]] in 1843 transformed it from a small market town of 2500 into a thriving railway hub that would become one of the largest [[Swindon Works|railway engineering complexes]] in the world at its peak.<ref name="domesday" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=STEAM and the history of Swindon Works |url=https://www.steam-museum.org.uk/about-us/history-of-steam/ |access-date=3 April 2023 |website=STEAM - Museum of the Great Western Railway |language=en-GB}}</ref> This brought with it pioneering amenities such as the UK's first lending library and a 'cradle-to-grave' healthcare centre that was later used as a blueprint for the NHS.<ref name=":2" /> Swindon's railway heritage can be primarily seen today with the [[grade 2 listed]] Railway Village and [[Museum of the Great Western Railway|STEAM Museum]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Council |first=Swindon Borough |title=STEAM - Museum of the Great Western Railway |url=https://www.swindon.gov.uk/info/20076/museums_galleries_and_heritage/475/steam_-_museum_of_the_great_western_railway |access-date=3 April 2023 |website=www.swindon.gov.uk |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Swindon |first=Visit |title=Visit Swindon |url=https://www.visitswindon.org.uk/news/swindons-railway-village-is-a-local-gem-and-a-nationally-listed-treasure.aspx |access-date=3 April 2023 |website=Visit Swindon |language=en}}</ref> The [[Swindon Designer Outlet|McArthurGlen Designer Outlet]] is housed in the renovated former works and the Brunel Shopping Centre is one of several places in Swindon that bears the name of the famous [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|engineer]] generally acknowledged with bringing the railways to the town.<ref name=":4" /><ref>{{Cite news |date=25 February 2016 |title=Did a ham sandwich cause Swindon to become a boomtown? |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-wiltshire-35605986 |access-date=3 April 2023}}</ref>

{{Main|History of Swindon}}

===Early history===
The [[Anglo-Saxon]] settlement of Swindon sat in a defensible position atop a [[limestone]] hill. It is referred to in the 1086 [[Domesday Book]] as Suindune,<ref name="domesday">{{OpenDomesday|SU1583|swindon|Swindon}}</ref> believed to be derived from the [[Old English language|Old English]] words "swine" and "dun" meaning "pig hill" or possibly Sweyn's hill, Sweyn being a Scandinavian name akin to Sven and English swain, meaning a young man.

Swindon is recorded in the Domesday Book as a [[Manorialism|manor]] in the [[Hundred (county division)|hundred]] of Blagrove, [[Wiltshire]]. It was one of the larger manors, recorded as having 27 households and a rent value of £10 14s, which was divided among five landlords.<ref name="domesday" /> Before the [[Battle of Hastings]] the Swindon estate was owned by an [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[Thegn|thane]] called Leofgeat.<ref name=":0" /> After the [[Norman Conquest]], Swindon was split into five holdings: the largest was held between [[Miles Crispin]] and Odin the Chamberlain,<ref name="domesday" /> and the second by [[Wadard]], a [[knight]] in the service of [[Odo of Bayeux]], [[brother]] of [[William the Conqueror|the king]].<ref name=":0">{{citation |author=Wadard and Vital |title=1066: The Hidden History in the Bayeux Tapestry}}</ref>{{page needed|date=November 2021}} The manors of Westlecot, Walcot, Rodbourne, Moredon and Stratton are also listed; all are now part of Swindon.

The [[Goddard family]] were [[lord of the manor]] from the 16th century for many generations, living at the [[manor house]], sometimes known as The Lawn.

Swindon was a small [[market town]], mainly for [[barter|barter trade]], until roughly 1848. This original market area is on top of the hill in central Swindon, now known as Old Town.<ref name="Chandler">John Chandler, Swindon Decoded, The Hobnob Press 2005, {{ISBN|0-946418-37-3}}.</ref>

The [[Industrial Revolution]] was responsible for an acceleration of Swindon's growth. Construction of the [[Wilts and Berks Canal]] in 1810 and the [[North Wilts Canal]] in 1819 brought trade to the area, and Swindon's population started to grow.

===Railway town===
[[File:GWR Church Swindon.jpg|alt=|thumb|Former lodging house in the Railway Village, now a community centre]]
Between 1841 and 1842, [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s [[Swindon Works]] was built for the repair and maintenance of locomotives on the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR). The GWR built a small railway village to house some of its workers. The [[Swindon Steam Railway Museum|Steam Railway Museum]] and [[English Heritage]], including the [[English Heritage Archive]], now occupy part of the old works. In the village were the GWR Medical Fund Clinic at Park House and its hospital, both on Faringdon Road, and the 1892 health centre in Milton Road, which housed clinics, a pharmacy, laundries, baths, [[Swindon Victorian Turkish Baths|Victorian Turkish baths]] and swimming pools, was almost opposite.

From 1871, GWR workers had a small amount deducted from their weekly pay and put into a healthcare fund; GWR doctors could prescribe them or their family members medicines or send them for medical treatment. In 1878 the fund began providing artificial limbs made by craftsmen from the carriage and wagon works, and nine years later opened its first dental surgery. In his first few months in post, the dentist extracted more than 2,000 teeth. From the opening in 1892 of the health centre, a doctor could also prescribe a haircut or even a bath. The [[cradle-to-grave]] extent of this service was later used as a blueprint for the [[National Health Service|NHS]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |date=24 October 2007 |title=Background |url=https://mechanics-trust.org.uk/history/background/ |url-status=dead |access-date=25 December 2021 |website=The Mechanics' Institution Trust |language=en-gb |archive-date=25 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211225134507/https://mechanics-trust.org.uk/history/background/}}</ref>

The Mechanics' Institute, formed in 1844, moved into a building that looked rather like a church and included a covered market, on 1 May 1855. The New Swindon Improvement Company, a [[co-operative]], raised the funds for this programme of self-improvement and paid the GWR £40 a year for its new home on a site at the heart of the railway village. It was a groundbreaking organisation that transformed the railway's workforce into some of the country's best-educated manual workers.<ref>[http://mechanics-trust.org.uk/history/1850-1870/  ''1850–1870'' – The Mechanics Institution Trust, Swindon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217090445/http://mechanics-trust.org.uk/history/1850-1870/ |date=17 December 2013 }}.

The Mechanics' Institute had the UK's first [[lending library]],<ref name=":2" /> and a range of improving lectures, access to a theatre and various other activities, such as ambulance classes and [[xylophone]] lessons. A former institute secretary formed the New Swindon Co-operative Society in 1853 which, after a schism in the society's membership, spawned the New Swindon Industrial Society, which ran a retail business from a stall in the market at the institute. The institute also nurtured pioneering trades unionists and encouraged local democracy.<ref>[http://mechanics-trust.org.uk/2003/07/this-is-our-heritage/  ''This is Our Heritage'' — 1996 lecture by Swindon labour movement historian Trevor Cockbill] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304185012/http://mechanics-trust.org.uk/2003/07/this-is-our-heritage/ |date=4 March 2016 }}.

When [[tuberculosis]] hit the new town, the Mechanics' Institute persuaded the industrial pioneers of North Wiltshire to agree that the railway's former employees should continue to receive medical attention from the doctors of the GWR Medical Society Fund, which the institute had played a role in establishing and funding.<ref>[http://mechanics-trust.org.uk/history/background/  ''Background'' – The Mechanics Institution Trust, Swindon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012181448/http://mechanics-trust.org.uk/history/background/ |date=12 October 2013 }}.

Swindon's 'other' railway, the [[Swindon, Marlborough and Andover Railway]], merged with the [[Swindon and Cheltenham Extension Railway]] to form the [[Midland & South Western Junction Railway]], which set out to join the [[London & South Western Railway]] with the [[Midland Railway]] at [[Cheltenham]]. The Swindon, Marlborough & Andover had planned to tunnel under the hill on which Swindon's Old Town stands but the money ran out and the railway ran into [[Swindon Town railway station]], off Devizes Road in the Old Town, skirting the new town to the west, intersecting with the [[Great Western Railway|GWR]] at [[Rushey Platt railway station|Rushey Platt]] and heading north for [[Cirencester]], Cheltenham and the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]], whose 'Midland Red' livery the M&SWJR adopted.

During the second half of the 19th century, Swindon New Town grew around the main line between London and [[Bristol]]. In 1900, the original market town, Old Swindon, merged with its new neighbour at the bottom of the hill to become a single town.<ref name="Chandler"/>

On 1 July 1923, the GWR took over the largely single-track M&SWJR and the line northwards from Swindon Town was diverted to [[Swindon railway station|Swindon Junction]] station, leaving the Town station with only the line south to Andover and Salisbury.<ref>[http://www.swindonsotherrailway.co.uk/his.html/  ''Swindon's Other Railway'' — the Swindon, Marlborough & Andover Railway] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020619050944/http://www.swindonsotherrailway.co.uk/his.html |date=19 June 2002 }}.

During the first half of the 20th century, the railway works was the town's largest employer and one of the biggest in the country, employing more than 14,500 workers. Alfred Williams<ref>Leonard Clark, Alfred Williams – His Life and Work, David and Charles 1969</ref> (1877–1930) wrote about his life as a hammerman at the works.<ref>Alfred Williams, Life in a railway factory, first published 1915, 2007 edition published by Sutton Publishing {{ISBN|978-0-7509-4660-5}}</ref>

The works' decline started in 1960, when it rolled out [[BR standard class 9F 92220 Evening Star|''Evening Star'']], the last steam engine to be built in the UK.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A15849868/ ''Evening Star — Steam Locomotive''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091203154340/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A15849868 |date=3 December 2009 }}, BBC, 29 November 2006. Retrieved on 21 July 2007.</ref> The works lost its locomotive building role and took on rolling stock maintenance for [[British Rail]]. In the late 1970s, much of the works closed and the rest followed in 1986.

The community centre in the railway village was originally the barrack accommodation for railway employees of the GWR. The building became the Railway Museum in the 1960s, until the opening of the STEAM Museum in the 2000s.

The [[Second World War]] saw an influx of new industries as part of the war effort; [[Vickers-Armstrong]] making aircraft at Stratton, and [[Plessey]] at Cheney Manor producing electrical components. By 1960, Plessey had become Swindon's biggest employer, with a predominantly female workforce.<ref>[http://www.swindonweb.com/index.asp?m=8&s=116&ss=396&t=THE+ELECTRONIC+AGE The Electronic Age], ''swindonweb.com'', 21 August 2014; retrieved 3 September 2019</ref>

[[David Murray John]], Swindon's town clerk from 1938 to 1974, is seen as a pioneering figure in Swindon's post-war regeneration: his last act before retirement was to sign the contract for Swindon's tallest building, which is now named after him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.swindonweb.com/?m=8&s=115&ss=462&c=1168&t=The%20David%20Murray%20John%20 |title=SwindonWeb – Brunel Tower David Murray John |work=swindonweb.com |access-date=27 March 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207181044/http://www.swindonweb.com/?m=8&s=115&ss=462&c=1168&t=The%20David%20Murray%20John%20 |archive-date=7 February 2012}}</ref>  Murray John's successor was David Maxwell Kent, appointed by the Swindon/Highworth Joint Committee in 1973: he had worked closely with Murray John and continued similar policies for a further twenty years. The [[Greater London Council]] withdrew from the Town Development Agreement and the local council continued the development on its own.

There was the problem of the Western Development and of [[Lydiard Park]] being in the new [[North Wiltshire]] district, but this was resolved by a boundary change to take in part of North Wiltshire. Another factor limiting local decision-taking was the continuing role of [[Wiltshire County Council]] in the administration of Swindon. Together with like-minded councils, a campaign was launched to bring an updated form of [[county borough]] status to Swindon. This was successful in 1997 with the formation of [[Swindon Borough Council]], covering the areas of the former Thamesdown and the former Highworth Rural District Council.

In February 2008, ''[[The Times]]'' named Swindon as one of "The 20 best places to buy a property in Britain".<ref>[http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/buying_and_selling/article3327954.ece The 20 best places to buy a property in Britain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509153728/http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/buying_and_selling/article3327954.ece |date=9 May 2008 }}, ''[[The Times]]'', Property pages, February 2008</ref> Only [[Warrington]] had a lower ratio of house prices to household income in 2007, with the average household income in Swindon among the highest in the country.

In October 2008, Swindon Council made a controversial move to ban fixed point [[speed cameras]].

In 2001, construction began on [[Priory Vale]], the third and final instalment in Swindon's 'Northern Expansion' project, which began with Abbey Meads and continued at St Andrew's Ridge.

In August 2019, a secondary school in the town was at the centre of a '[[County lines (drug trafficking)|county lines]]' drug supply investigation by Wiltshire Police, with 40 pupils suspected of being involved in the supply of cannabis and cocaine, and girls as young as 14 being coerced into sexual activity in exchange for drugs.<ref>'County lines drugs gang recruits 40 pupils in one school-one for each class' report by Charles Hymas, Home Affairs Editor, The Daily Telegraph 23 August 2019 page 11.</ref>

The local council was created in 1974 as the Borough of Thamesdown, out of the areas of Swindon Borough and Highworth Rural District. It was not initially called Swindon, because the borough covers a larger area than the town; it was renamed as the [[Borough of Swindon]] in 1997. The borough became a [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority]] on 1 April 1997,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19951774_en_1.htm |title=The Wiltshire (Borough of Thamesdown)(Structural Change) Order 1995 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=11 August 2011 |access-date=16 June 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080902025517/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19951774_en_1.htm |archive-date=2 September 2008}}</ref> following a review by the [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)|Local Government Commission for England]].

{{See also|List of places in Swindon}}

Swindon is a town in northeast Wiltshire, {{Convert|35|mi|km}} west-northwest of Reading and the same distance east-northeast of Bristol 'as the crow flies'.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/UK_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Swindon,+UK&toplace=Bristol,+UK&dt1=ChIJ5eTbPU9EcUgRmpTF6Te_VqU&dt2=ChIJYdizgWaDcUgRH9eaSy6y5I4 |title=Distance between Swindon, UK and Bristol, UK (UK) |website=distancecalculator.globefeed.com |access-date=27 April 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180427235128/https://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/UK_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Swindon,+UK&toplace=Bristol,+UK&dt1=ChIJ5eTbPU9EcUgRmpTF6Te_VqU&dt2=ChIJYdizgWaDcUgRH9eaSy6y5I4 |archive-date=27 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/UK_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Swindon,+UK&toplace=Reading,+UK&dt1=ChIJ5eTbPU9EcUgRmpTF6Te_VqU&dt2=ChIJtz092XggdEgRlHn6zn-f4So |title=Distance between Swindon, UK and Reading, UK (UK) |website=distancecalculator.globefeed.com |access-date=27 April 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180427235128/https://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/UK_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Swindon,+UK&toplace=Reading,+UK&dt1=ChIJ5eTbPU9EcUgRmpTF6Te_VqU&dt2=ChIJtz092XggdEgRlHn6zn-f4So |archive-date=27 April 2018}}</ref> The town is also {{Convert|26|mi|km}} southwest of [[Oxford]], {{Convert|65|mi|km}} south-southeast of [[Birmingham]], {{Convert|71|mi|km}} west of London and {{Convert|60|mi|km}} east of Cardiff. Swindon town centre is also equidistant from the county boundaries of Berkshire and Gloucestershire, both being {{Convert|8|mi|km}} away. The border with Oxfordshire is slightly closer, being around {{Convert|5|mi|km|0}} away.

Swindon is within a landlocked county and is a considerable distance from any coastline. The nearest section of coast on the [[English Channel]] is near Christchurch, {{Convert|56|mi|km}} due south. Meanwhile, the eastern limit of the [[Bristol Channel]], just north of [[Weston-super-mare]], lies {{Convert|53|mi|km}} to the west.

The landscape is dominated by the chalk hills of the Wiltshire Downs to the south and east. The Old Town stands on a hill of Purbeck and Portland stone; this was quarried from Roman times until the 1950s. The area that was known as New Swindon is made up of mostly Kimmeridge clay with outcrops of Corrallian clay in the areas of Penhill and Pinehurst. Oxford clay makes up the rest of the borough.<ref name="geology">{{cite book |author=Crittall, Elizabeth |author2=Rogers, Kenneth |author3=Shrimpton, Colin |title=A history of Swindon to 1965 |year=1983 |publisher=Wiltshire Library & Museum Service |isbn=0-86080-107-1 |chapter=Geology}}</ref> The [[River Ray, Wiltshire|River Ray]] rises at Wroughton and forms much of the borough's western boundary, joining the [[Thames]] which defines the northern boundary, and the source of which is located in nearby [[Kemble, Gloucestershire]]. The [[River Cole, Wiltshire|River Cole]] and its tributaries flow northeastward from the town and form the northeastern boundary.

===Climate===
Swindon has an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]), like the vast majority of the British Isles, with cool winters and warm summers. The nearest official weather station is [[RAF Lyneham]], about {{convert|10|mi|km}} west southwest of Swindon town centre. The weather station's elevation is {{Convert|145|m|ft}} in a rural setting, compared to the typical {{Convert|100|m|ft}} encountered around Swindon town centre, so is likely marginally cooler throughout the year.

The absolute maximum is {{Convert|34.9|C|F}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/monitordetail.php?seasonid=14&year=1990&indexid=TXx&stationid=1872 |title=1990 August maximum |access-date=28 February 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430200210/http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/monitordetail.php?seasonid=14&year=1990&indexid=TXx&stationid=1872 |archive-date=30 April 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> recorded during August 1990.

Sunshine, at 1,565 hours a year, is typical for inland parts of Southern England, although significantly higher than most areas further north.

Annual rainfall averages slightly under {{convert|720|mm|0|abbr=on}} per year, with 123 days reporting over {{convert|1|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain.

The town's Polish ex-servicemen's club, which had run a football team for 45 years, closed in 2012. Barman Jerzy Trojan blamed the decline of both club and team on the children and grandchildren of the original refugees losing their Polish identity.<ref name=":1" />
