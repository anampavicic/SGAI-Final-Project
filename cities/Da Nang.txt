Most of the names by which Da Nang has been known make reference to its position at the [[Han River (Vietnam)|Hàn River]] estuary. The city's present name is generally agreed to be a Vietnamese adaptation of the [[Cham language|Cham]] word ''da nak'', which is translated as "opening of a large river".<ref name="dncityname">{{cite web|url=http://danang.gov.vn/TabID/76/CID/704/ItemID/8711/default.aspx|title=Names of Đà Nẵng through periods of time|publisher=Danang People's Committee|date=3 January 2004|access-date=20 April 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319233811/http://danang.gov.vn/TabID/76/CID/704/ItemID/8711/default.aspx|archive-date=19 March 2012}}</ref><ref name="hoidap">{{cite book|title=Hỏi đáp về Quảng Nam-Đà Nẵng|trans-title=Questions and Answers about Quảng Nam-Đà Nẵng|author=Bùi Minh Quốc}}</ref>

Other [[Chamic languages|Chamic]] sources, with similar definitions, have been proposed. Inrasara (aka Phú Trạm), a researcher specializing in [[Champa]], suggests ''Da Nang'' is a variation of the Cham word ''daknan'' (lit. "the large water"); Sakaya (aka Văn Món), another Champa researcher, claims a connection with the [[Raglai people|Raglai]] word ''danang'', meaning "river source".<ref name="dnname">{{Cite web|url=http://baodanang.vn/channel/5437/201101/nam-moi-noi-chuyen-ten-que-2029687/|title=Năm mới nói chuyện tên quê|website=Báo Đà Nẵng|access-date=16 July 2020|archive-date=16 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200716223328/https://baodanang.vn/channel/5437/201101/nam-moi-noi-chuyen-ten-que-2029687/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Another name given to Da Nang was ''Cửa Hàn'' (lit. "mouth of the Han <nowiki>[river]</nowiki>"). The name used by the French, ''Tourane'', is said to derive from this name, by way of a rough transliteration.<ref name="footprint08">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0FKCuR0i0SMC&q=cua+han+tourane&pg=PA202|title=Footprint Vietnam|publisher=Footprint Travel Guides|year=2008|access-date=19 March 2011|isbn=978-1-906098-13-1|page=202|archive-date=12 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210812052723/https://books.google.com/books?id=0FKCuR0i0SMC&q=cua+han+tourane&pg=PA202|url-status=live}}</ref> Notably, this name (spelled "Cua han") appears on maps of the area drafted by [[Alexandre de Rhodes]] in 1650.

==History==
=== Ancient Vietnam ===
{{Main|History of the Cham–Vietnamese wars}}
The city's origins date back to the ancient kingdom of [[Champa]], established in 192 AD. At its peak, the Chams' sphere of influence stretched from [[Huế]] to [[Vũng Tàu]]. The city of [[Indrapura (Champa)|Indrapura]], at the site of the modern village of Dong Duong in [[Quảng Nam Province]] (about {{cvt|50|km|mi|}} from Da Nang), was the capital of Champa from about 875 to about 1000 AD. Also in the region of Da Nang were the ancient Cham city of Singhapura ("City of the Lion"), the location of which has been identified with an archeological site in the modern village of Trà Kiệu, and the valley of [[Mỹ Sơn]],<ref>{{cite web|title=KINGDOM OF CHAMPA|url=https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~ebolt/history398/KingdomOfChampa.html|access-date=20 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503061157/https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~ebolt/history398/KingdomOfChampa.html|archive-date=3 May 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> where a number of ruined temples and towers can still be viewed.

In the latter half of the 10th century, the kings of Indrapura came into conflict with the [[Đại Việt]], who were then based at Hoa Lư near modern [[Hanoi]].<ref>Lê Thành Khôi, ''Histoire du Vietnam'', p.122, 141.</ref> Champa had been independent, it found itself in need to defend its territory to contain the threat posed by the [[Khmer Empire]] in the west, and expand its territory to the north, hoping to conquer the Vietnamese nation. There, with the Vietnamese Kingdom in turmoil following the assassination of [[Đinh Tiên Hoàng]], Champa made an unsuccessful attempt to invade [[Đại Việt]] in 979 with support of China, but failed due to the strong defence of Vietnamese territory under the command of [[Lê Hoàn]]. In 982, three ambassadors sent to Champa by Emperor [[Lê Hoàn]] of the Đại Việt (founder of the [[Early Lê dynasty]]) were detained in Indrapura. Lê Hoàn decided to go on the offensive, sacking Indrapura and killing the Cham King Parameshvaravarman I. As a result of these setbacks, the Cham eventually abandoned Indrapura around 1000 AD.<ref>Ngô Vǎn Doanh, ''Champa'', p.34; Ngô Vǎn Doanh, ''Mỹ Sơn Relics'', p.75-76.</ref>

The Đại Việt campaign against Champa continued into the late 11th century, when the Cham were forced to cede their three northern provinces to the rulers of the [[Lý dynasty]]. Soon afterward, Vietnamese farmers began moving into the untilled former Cham lands, turning them into rice fields and moving relentlessly southward, delta by delta, along the narrow coastal plain. The southward expansion of Đại Việt (known as ''[[Nam Tiến]]'') continued for several centuries, culminating in the annexation of most of the Cham territories by the end of the 15th century.

The Điện Hải Citadel was first built in 1813 as an earthen fortress located to the north of its present position, with An Hải citadel on the east bank built by Emperor [[Gia Long]] to protect the port, and by 1819, both Điện Hải and An Hải citadels had been rebuilt in brick. In 1823, Gia Long's son and successor [[Minh Mạng]] rebuilt the original Điện Hải fortress on a high mound at the current location, being upgraded from a fortress (đồn) to a citadel (thành) in 1835.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Doling |first=Tim |date=1 January 2020 |title=Dien Hai – Da Nang's Forgotten Vauban Citadel |url=http://www.historicvietnam.com/dien-hai-citadel/ |access-date=7 May 2024 |website=Historic Vietnam |language=English}}</ref>

One of the first Europeans to visit Da Nang was Portuguese explorer [[António de Faria]], who anchored in Da Nang in 1535. Faria was one of the first Westerners to write about the area and, through his influence, Portuguese ships began to call regularly at [[Hội An]], which was then a much more important port than Da Nang.<ref name="af-hoian">{{Cite web|url=https://www.angelfire.com/vt/hongnam/hoianhistory.html|title=HOI AN's History|website=[[Angelfire]]|access-date=14 July 2010|archive-date=18 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718001227/http://www.angelfire.com/vt/hongnam/hoianhistory.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, French and Spanish traders and missionaries regularly made landfall at [[Hội An]], just south of Đà Nẵng. An American, John White, arrived at Da Nang (then called '''Turon''') on 18 June 1819 in the [[brig]] ''Franklin'' of [[Salem, Massachusetts]], and was advised that the country was recovering from devastating wars, and that what little goods had been produced in the area was already allocated.

=== French Indochina ===

In 1847, French vessels dispatched by [[Admiral Cécille]] [[Bombardment of Tourane (1847)|bombarded Đà Nẵng]], ostensibly on the grounds of alleged persecution of Roman Catholic missionaries. In August 1858, once again ostensibly on the grounds of religious persecution, French troops, led by Admiral [[Charles Rigault de Genouilly]], and under the orders of [[Napoleon III]], landed in Đà Nẵng as part of the punitive [[Cochinchina Campaign]].

The French overpowered the Vietnamese stationed in Da Nang, swiftly occupying the city and Tiên Sa peninsula (present-day Sơn Trà peninsula). The occupying forces were quickly [[Siege of Tourane|placed under siege]] by the Vietnamese army under the command of Nguyễn Tri Phương, and were eventually forced to retreat in March 1860. The French were able to invade the southern stronghold of [[Saigon]] and, in June 1862, several provinces of southern Vietnam were ceded to the French as [[Cochinchina]] with the signing of the [[Treaty of Saigon (1862)|Treaty of Saigon]].

Da Nang led the [[Provincial Competitiveness Index]] rankings in 2008, 2009, and 2010 (and was second after [[Bình Dương Province]] in the three years before that), benefiting mostly from good infrastructure, good performance in labour training, transparency, proactive provincial leadership and low entry costs.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

On Vietnam's Provincial Competitiveness Index 2023, a key tool for evaluating the business environment in Vietnam’s provinces, Danang received a score of 68.79. This was a slight improvement from 2022 in which the province received a score of 68.52.

=== Agriculture, forestry, fishing ===
Despite its status as a city, 37,800 people in Da Nang were employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing as of 2007, producing 45,000t of rice and 41,000t of fish.<ref name="GSO09">General Statistics Office (2009): Socio-economic Statistical Data of 63 Provinces and Cities, Vietnam. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi</ref> However, employment in these sectors had a clear negative trend in the first decade of the 21st century.<ref name="GSO09"/> Gross output has also been decreasing during the second half of the decade.<ref name="BDSO09"/> Given Da Nang's lack of agricultural land (9200ha as of 2007) and its location at the coast, fishing has been contributing more to the economy than agriculture, with a gross output more than twice that of agriculture.<ref name="GSO09"/>

=== Industry ===
Da Nang is a diversified industrial center, including industries such as machinery, electrics, chemicals, shipbuilding, and textiles.<ref name=Atlat>Atlat Dia li Viet Nam (Geographical Atlas of Vietnam). NXB Giao Duc, Hanoi: 2010</ref> Specific industrial products include aquatic products, fabric, clothes, bricks, fertilizer, cement, soap, paper, and medical tablets.<ref name="GSO09"/> The city's industry may diversify further. [[EADS]] is planning to set up an industrial park focused on the aviation industry in Da Nang.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Dự án công nghiệp hàng không Đà Nẵng|newspaper=BBC Vietnamese|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/vietnamese/vietnam/2010/06/100610_eads_danang.shtml|date=10 June 2010|access-date=5 August 2011|archive-date=13 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613233421/http://www.bbc.co.uk/vietnamese/vietnam/2010/06/100610_eads_danang.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref>

As of 2007, Da Nang industry was dominated by the state sector, which made up 57% of [[gross output]]. This is about the same as its share in 2000.<ref name="GSO09"/> Over 80% of the state industry is centrally managed (in other words: belongs to state corporations headquartered in [[Hanoi]]).<ref name="GSO09"/> Almost half of the rest is contributed by the foreign-invested sector, while the private domestic sector is still relatively small and has not been able to significantly increase its share compared to the state sector. Industry grew by an average of 14.8% per year from 2000 to 2007, making it the main engine of economic growth. However, it has the second lowest industrial growth rate in the [[South Central Coast]] (behind only [[Khánh Hòa Province|Khanh Hoa Province]]). Employment has grown at an average of 5.75%, reaching 118,900 in 2007.<ref name=GSO09calc/>

Historically, Da Nang's main marketplace has been the Hàn Market ({{langx|vi|Chợ Hàn}}), which is downtown near the west bank of the Hàn River, between Tran Phu and Bach Dang Streets. This market, much like [[Bến Thành Market|Ben Thanh Market]] in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]], offers a wide variety of goods sold by many different vendors, such as clothing, silk, jewelry, flowers, foodstuffs such as dried fruit and fish, as well as coffee, tea and wine (including Vietnamese [[snake wine]]). {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The tourism sector is a vital component of Da Nang's economy. Its status as a transportation hub for central Vietnam and its proximity to several [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s, including the [[Imperial City (Huế)|Imperial City of Hue]], the Old Town of [[Hội An|Hoi An]], and the [[Mỹ Sơn|My Son]] ruins fuels much of its tourist activity.

Mỹ Sơn is an archaeological site dating back more than a thousand years, in [[Quảng Nam Province|Quang Nam]]. Located in a remote forested valley some 70&nbsp;km west of Da Nang, this former capital and religious center of the [[Champa]] kingdom once contained in excess of 70 style temples and stupas. Although badly damaged by bombing raids in the 1960s, the site still has more than 20 structures and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999. Many statues, sculptures and reliefs recovered from Mỹ Sơn are kept in the [[Museum of Cham Sculpture]], near the [[Han River (Vietnam)|Hàn River]] in the heart of Da Nang. Dating from the fourth to the 14th centuries, the sensual artwork on these works depicts daily activities as well as Hindu and Buddhist religious themes.

The [[Marble Mountains (Vietnam)|Marble Mountains]] are rocky limestone outcrops jutting out of the beach just south of Da Nang. Paths lead to the top of the forested cliffs, providing views of Non Nuoc Beach and the South China Sea. The caves in the cliffs were originally inhabited by the [[Chams|Cham people]]. Later, the [[Nguyễn dynasty|Nguyen dynasty]] built numerous pagodas among the caves. The Marble Mountains are home to various artisans producing sculpture and artwork at its base at [[Non Nước Village|Non Nuoc Village]].

Non Nuoc Beach is a white sandy beach on the outskirts of Đà Nẵng that is renowned for its history as an R&R destination for American troops during the [[Vietnam War]]. Today, the beach, along with Mỹ Khê beach to the north, are home to expensive resorts, surfing, and entertainment facilities. [[Bà Nà Hills|Ba Na Hills]] is a mountain resort with a 5&nbsp;km-long [[Aerial lift|cable car]] system which carries guests up to Ba Na's peak at 1487m above sea level. [[Sơn Trà Mountain|Son Tra Mountain]], just some miles away from the city centre with some wild streams and resorts along the seaside. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

National Highways [[National Route 1 (Vietnam)|1]] and 14B run through the city, providing road connections to [[Hanoi]] in the north and [[Ho Chi Minh City]] in the south, as well as the Central Highlands and [[Laos]] to the west. The [[Hải Vân Pass|Hai Pass]] is a mountain pass separating Da Nang and [[Thừa Thiên Huế Province]], where Highway 1A passes through. To cut down on transit time and the danger to motorists from navigating the twisting mountain road, the [[Hải Vân Tunnel]] was built, opening in 2005. It is the longest tunnel in south-east Asia at 6.28&nbsp;km, and allows motorists to save between 30 minutes and an hour on traveling times over the old Hải Vân Pass route.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hai Van Tunnel Construction Project {{!}} Vietnam {{!}} Countries & Regions {{!}} JICA |url=https://www.jica.go.jp/Resource/vietnam/english/activities/activity17.html |access-date=4 May 2024 |website=www.jica.go.jp}}</ref> An [[Controlled-access highway|expressway]] between Da Nang and nearby Quang Ngai has completed its construction in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Vietnam+ (VietnamPlus) |date=2 September 2018 |title=Da Nang – Quang Ngai Expressway fully put into use |url=https://en.vietnamplus.vn/post-137514.vnp |access-date=4 May 2024 |website=Vietnam+ (VietnamPlus) |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=31 August 2018 |title=Da Nang-Quang Ngai Expressway to open to traffic on National Day |url=https://en.sggp.org.vn/share73729.html |access-date=4 May 2024 |website=SGGP English Edition |language=en}}</ref>

Several bridges cross the Han River and its tributaries in Da Nang, including the iconic [[Han River Bridge]], [[Trần Thị Lý Bridge|Tran Thi Ly Bridge]], [[Nguyễn Văn Trỗi Bridge|Nguyen Van Troi Bridge]], [[Tuyen Son Bridge]] and the recently completed [[Thuận Phước Bridge|Thuan Phuoc Bridge]], which is the longest suspension bridge in Vietnam.<ref name="IPC">{{cite news |title=Vietnam's longest suspension bridge inaugurated |publisher=Danang Investment Promotion Center |date=23 July 2009 |url=http://www.vietnamnews.biz/Vietnams-longest-suspension-bridge-inaugurated_570.html |access-date=19 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304045654/http://www.vietnamnews.biz/Vietnams-longest-suspension-bridge-inaugurated_570.html |archive-date=4 March 2010 }}</ref> The [[Dragon River Bridge]] will cross the Han River at the Le Dinh Duong/Bach Dang [[roundabout]], offering tourists coming from Đà Nẵng International Airport a more direct route to My Khe and Non Nuoc beaches, along the city's eastern edge.

{{Main|Da Nang Port}}
Da Nang's port system is the third largest in [[Vietnam]] after [[Ho Chi Minh City]] and [[Haiphong]]. In 2008, Da Nang's port handled 2.7 million tons of cargo, of which 1.2 million tons were exports, 525,900 tons were imports, and 985,600 tons were domestic cargo. Over 29,600 passengers passed through the port in 2008, a significant increase over previous years.<ref name="worldportsource"/> The port system consists of two areas: Tiên Sa Seaport, and Song Hàn Terminal. Tien Sa Seaport has a navigation depth of {{cvt|11|m|ft|0|}}, and is able to receive [[Tank ship#Tanker capacity|medium range]] tankers of up to 45,000 [[Deadweight tonnage|DWT]], as well as container ships and large cruise ships. The approach to Song Hàn Terminal is {{cvt|12|nmi|km}} long with a navigation depth of {{cvt|6–7|m|ft|0|}}, and can accommodate vessels of up to 5,000 DWT. Vietnam National Shipping Lines (Vinalines) is the port authority for Đà Nẵng's port system.<ref name="worldportsource">{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/VNM_Da_Nang_Port_1457.php|title=Da Nang Port|website=World Port Source|access-date=13 May 2010|archive-date=1 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201200457/http://worldportsource.com/ports/VNM_Da_Nang_Port_1457.php|url-status=live}}</ref>
