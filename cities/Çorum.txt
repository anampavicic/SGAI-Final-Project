'''Çorum''' ({{IPA|tr|ˈtʃoɾum}}) ([[Medieval Greek]]: Ευχάνεια, romanized: Euchaneia) is a northern [[Anatolia]]n city in [[Turkey]]. Çorum is located inland in the central [[Black Sea|Black Sea Region]] of Turkey and is approximately {{convert|244|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from [[Ankara]] and {{convert|608|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from [[Istanbul]]. It is the seat of [[Çorum Province]] and of [[Çorum District]].<ref name=il>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx İlçe Belediyesi], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory. Retrieved 1 March 2023.</ref> Its population is 269,595 (2022).<ref name=tuik>{{Cite web |title=Address-based population registration system (ADNKS) results dated 31 December 2022, Favorite Reports|url=https://biruni.tuik.gov.tr/medas/?kn=95&locale=en |access-date=13 March 2023|publisher=[[TÜİK]]|language=en|format=XLS}}</ref> The city has an [[elevation]] of {{convert|801|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level.

Çorum is primarily known for its [[Phrygia]]n and [[Hittites|Hittite]] archaeological sites, its [[thermal spring]]s, and its native roasted chickpea snacks known nationally as [[leblebi]].

==History==
There is ample archaeological evidence for human presence in the area since the  [[Paleolithic Age]].<ref name="History of Çorum">[http://www.corum.gov.tr/corumweb/giris.asp History of Çorum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317043011/http://www.corum.gov.tr/corumweb/giris.asp |date=2009-03-17 }}</ref>
The area prospered during the Bronze Age,  with the emergence of the [[Hittite Empire]] between 1650 and 1200 BCE. [[Hattusa]], the Hittite capital,  was located in the region owing to its inherent geographic protection and the well-established local economy as supported by the regional [[Karum (trade post)|Karum]] system.<ref name="History of Çorum" />

There is a hypothesis that the Byzantine town of [[Euchaneia]] was at or near the site of the modern city, but others place Euchaneia further east, at [[Euchaita]]. In [[Ancient Greek]] sources, Çorum was known as Niconia (Nikonya), and in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period known as Evkaite.<ref>Christopher Walter, ''The Warrior Saints in Byzantine Art and Tradition'' (2016), citing [[Hippolyte Delehaye]] (1909).</ref>

The settlement of Çorum proper can be traced only to the 16th century. The name is of unknown origin and is first attested in Ottoman records about a Seljuk fortress, ''Çorum Kalesi,'' described by Evliya Çelebi.<ref name="Index Anatolicus">{{cite web | url=https://nisanyanyeradlari.com/?y=&lv=&t=%C3%A7orum&cry=TR&ua=10 | title=Nişanyan Yeradları - Türkiye ve Çevre Ülkeler Yerleşim Birimleri Envanteri }}</ref> In the mid-16th century, the fortress was divided into four [[Mahallah|mahalle]], or quarters. From 1867 until 1922, Çorum was part of the [[Angora vilayet]].

==Çorum today==

The town today is generally tidy and pleasant, with a locally popular countryside. As with most [[Central Anatolia]]n and inland [[Black Sea]] towns, the population is largely conservative, leading to a generally more restricted nightlife that favors dry establishments, although there are some bars, pubs, and cafés that offer a mix of contemporary and traditional Turkish folk music. Within the city, there is a good range of shops, cafés, and restaurants, with a cuisine that includes a variety of pastries including the nationally known [[mantı|Çorum Mantısı]] - a popular dish similar to [[ravioli]] that is slowly baked in a brick oven or steamed in a beef broth. As well as the archeological and other historic sites, the countryside surrounding Çorum offers many places for picnics, particularly near the Çomar reservoir or in the mountains around the province.

The old Ottoman houses, the 19th-century clock tower, and the Çorum Museum, which displays a range of artefacts from excavations in the region, are popular tourist attractions. An ''International Hittite Congress'' of archaeologists is held in Çorum every three years.

==Economy==
Although the economic output of the city has historically been relatively small, with a focus on traditional crafts such as [[coppersmith]]ing, [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]], [[weaving|hand weaving]], [[agriculture]], and [[animal husbandry]], over the past two decades, the city has shown a significant growth in [[Manufacturing|industrial]] production and light engineering, making it one of the most industrially advanced cities relative to its population size.

Originally home to about 20 tile and brick manufacturing facilities and 10 flour and feed mills, the city today produces a wide variety of products ranging from [[cement]] to [[automobile|automobile parts]], [[refined sugar]] to [[dairy products]], [[textiles]] to [[computer|computer parts]], and, more recently, [[poultry]] through chicken farming.<ref>[http://www.corum.gov.tr/corumweb/giris.asp Economy of Çorum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317043011/http://www.corum.gov.tr/corumweb/giris.asp |date=2009-03-17 }}</ref>
