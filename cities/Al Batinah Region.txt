The region occupied an important location on the coast of [[Gulf of Oman]]. It lay between [[Khatmat Malaha]]h in the north and Ras al-Hamra in the south, and confined between Al-[[Hajar Mountains]] in the west and the Gulf of Oman in the east. Most of Oman's population were in that region, because of the green plains between the Hajar Mountains and the sea. 

== Provinces ==
Al Batinah Region contained the largest number of [[Provinces of Oman|province]]s (''[[wilayat]]''), numbering twelve 12:

* [[Sohar]]
* [[Ar Rustaq]]

* [[Al-Khaburah]]
* [[Suwayq]]
* [[Nakhal]]
* [[Wadi Al Maawil]]
* [[Al Awabi]]
* [[Al-Musannah]]
* [[Barka (Oman)|Barka]]

[[Suwayq]] is considered as the biggest wilayah in the Batinah region. [[Sohar]] was the regional capital. It is a populous city with a [[corniche]], fish [[souq]] and numerous [[mosques]].
