== Historical ==
{{See also|History of Uttar Pradesh|Saharanpur division}}

===Medieval period===
During the reign of [[Iltutmish]] (r 1211–1236), the region became a part of the Delhi Sultanate. At that time, most of the area remained covered with forests and marshlands, through which the Paondhoi, Dhamola, and Ganda Nala rivers flowed. The climate was humid and malaria outbreaks were common. [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]], the Sultan of Delhi (1325–1351), undertook a campaign in the northern ''doab'' to crush the rebellion of the [[Siwalik Hills|Shivalik]] kings in 1340, when according to local tradition he learned of the presence of a [[sufi]] saint on the banks of the Paondhoi River. After visiting the sage, he ordered that henceforth this region would be known as 'Shah-Haroonpur', after the Sufi Saint ''Shah Haroon Chishti''.<ref>[https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V21_375.gif History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230325212135/https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V21_375.gif |date=25 March 2023}} [[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]], v. 21, p.&nbsp;369. 1909.</ref> The simple but well-preserved tomb of this saint is situated in the oldest quarter of Saharanpur city, between the Mali Gate/Bazar Dinanath and Halwai Hatta. By the end of the 14th century, the power of the Sultanate had declined and it was attacked by [[Timur]] the Lame (1336–1405) of Central Asia. Timur had marched through the Saharanpur region in 1399 to sack Delhi and people of the region fought his army unsuccessfully. A weakened Sultanate was later conquered by the Central Asian Mogul king [[Babur]] (1483–1531).

===Mughal period===
In the 16th century, [[Babur]], a [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] descendant of [[Timur]] and [[Descent from Genghis Khan|Genghis Khan]] from [[Fergana Valley]] (modern-day [[Uzbekistan]]), invaded across the [[Khyber Pass]] and founded the [[Mughal Empire]], covering India, along with modern-day [[Afghanistan]], Pakistan and [[Bangladesh]]<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/empires/mughals/ The Islamic World to 1600: Rise of the Islamic Empires (The Mughal Empire)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927121217/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/empires/mughals/ |date=2011-09-27 }}</ref> The Mughals were descended from Persianised Central Asian [[Turkic people|Turks]] (with significant [[Mongol]] admixture).

During the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal period]], [[Akbar]] (1542–1605), Saharanpur became an administrative unit under the Province of Delhi. Akbar bestowed the feudal ''[[jagir]]'' of Saharanpur to the Mughal treasurer, Sah Ranveer Singh, an Aggarwal Jain who laid the foundations of the present-day city on the site of an army cantonment. The nearest settlements at that time were [[Shekhpura]] and Malhipur. Saharanpur was a walled city, with four gates: the Sarai Gate, the Mali Gate, the Buria Gate, and the Lakhi Gate. The city was divided into the neighbourhoods named Nakhasa Bazar, Shah Behlol, Rani Bazar and Lakhi Gate. The ruins of Shah Ran Veer Singh's old fort can still be seen in the Chaudharian locality of Saharanpur, not far from the better known 'Bada-Imam-bada'. He also built a large [[Jain]] temple in Muhallah/Toli Chaundhariyan,<ref>Madhu Jain, O. C. Handa, and Omacanda Handa, ''Wood Handicraft: A Study of Its Origin and Development in Saharanpur'', Indus Publishing (2000), pp.&nbsp;22–24. {{ISBN|81-7387-103-5}}</ref> it is now known as the 'Digamber-Jain Panchayati Mandir'.

===The Sayyids and Rohillas===
Mughal emperors [[Akbar]] and later [[Shah Jahan]] (1592–1666) bestowed the administrative ''[[pargana]]'' of Sarwat on Muslim [[Sayyid]] families. In 1633, one of them founded a city and named it and the surrounding region [[Muzaffarnagar]], in honour of his father, Sayyid Muzaffar Ali Khan. The Sayyids ruled the area until the 1739 invasion by [[Nadir Shah]]. After his departure, anarchy prevailed across the entire ''doab'' with the region ruled in succession by Jats. Taking advantage of this anarchy, the [[Rohillas]] took control of the entire trans-Gangetic region.

[[Ahmad Shah Durrani]], the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] ruler who invaded Northwestern and Northern India in the 1750s, conferred the territory of Saharanpur as Jagir on Rohilla chief Najaf Khan, who assumed the title of Nawab [[Najib ad-Dawlah|Najeeb-ud-Daula]] and took up residence in Saharanpur in 1754. He made Gaunsgarh his capital and tried to strengthen his position against [[Maratha Empire]] attacks by entering an alliance with the Hindu [[Gurjar]] chieftain Manohar Singh. In 1759, Najeeb-ud-Daula issued a Deed of Agreement handing over 550 villages to Manohar Singh, who became the Raja of [[Landhaura|Landaura]].

===Maratha period===
In 1757, the Maratha army captured the Saharanpur region, which resulted in Najeeb-ud-Daula losing control of Saharanpur to the Maratha rulers [[Raghunathrao|Raghunath Rao]] and [[Malharao Holkar]]. The conflict between Rohillas and Marathas came to an end on 18{{nbsp}}December 1788 with the arrest of [[Ghulam Kadir|Ghulam Qadir]], the grandson of Najeeb-ud-Daula, who was defeated by the Maratha general [[Mahadaji Shinde|Mahadaji Scindia]]. The most significant contribution of Nawab Ghulam Qadir to Saharanpur city is the Nawab Ganj area and the Ahmedabadi fortress therein, which still stands. The death of Ghulam Qadir put an end to the Rohilla administration in Saharanpur and it became the northernmost district of the Maratha Empire. Ghani Bahadur Banda was appointed its first Maratha governor. The Maratha Regime saw the construction of the Bhuteshwar Temple and Bagheshwar Temple in Saharanpur city. In 1803, following the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]], when the [[British East India Company]] defeated the Maratha Empire, Saharanpur came under British suzerainty.<ref>{{cite book

===British colonial period (1803–1947 AD)===

When India rebelled in 1857 against the foreign Company's occupation, now referred to as the First War of Indian Independence, the Saharanpur and the present-day Muzaffarnagar Districts were part of that uprising. The centre of freedom fighters' operations was Shamli, a small town in the Muzaffarnagar region which was liberated for some time. After the uprising failed, British retribution was severe. Death and destruction was particularly directed against the Muslims of the region, whom the British considered as the main instigators of the rebellion (even though [[Hindu]] [[Gurjars]] were the ones who had led the revolt ).<ref>Stokes, E. (1969). "[http://www.jstor.org/stable/2638016 Rural Revolt in the Great Rebellion of 1857 in India: A Study of the Saharanpur and Muzaffarnagar Districts]". ''The Historical Journal'', 12(4), 606–627.</ref> When social reconstruction started, the cultural and political history of Muslims began to revolve around Deoband and Aligarh. [[Muhammad Qasim Nanautavi|Muhammad Qasim Nanautawi]] and [[Rashid Ahmad Gangohi]], both proponents of the reformer [[Shah Waliullah Dehlawi|Shah Waliullah]]'s ideology for social and political rejuvenation, established a school in Deoband in 1867. It found popularity and global recognition as the [[Darul Uloom Deoband]]. Its founders' mission was twofold: to raise and spread a team of scholars able to awaken the religious and social consciousness of Muslims through peaceful methods and to make efforts, through them, to educate Muslims in their faith and culture; and to bring about a feeling of nationalism and national unity by promoting the concept of Hindu-Muslim unity and a united India. Muslim scholars in the city of Saharanpur were active supporters of this ideology and went on to establish the [[Mazahir Uloom]] theological seminary six months later.

====Company Garden====

The Saharanpur Botanical Gardens, known as the Company Garden and once the preserve of British East India Company, is one of the oldest existing gardens in India, dating to before 1750. Then named Farahat-Bakhsh, it was originally a pleasure ground set out by a local chief, Intazam ud-ullah. In 1817, it was acquired by the [[British East India Company]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=PjfVFGM4p6wC&dq=Farahat-Bakhsh&pg=PA297 Sharad Singh Negi, ''Biodiversity and its conservation in India''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230325212243/https://books.google.com/books?id=PjfVFGM4p6wC&dq=Farahat-Bakhsh&pg=PA297 |date=25 March 2023 }} 2nd revised ed. New Delhi, Indus Publishing (2008) {{ISBN|978-81-7387-211-2}}</ref> and placed under the authority of the District [[Surgeon]]. [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] says of this Botanical Garden that "''Amongst its greatest triumphs may be considered the introduction of the tea-plant from China, a fact I allude to, as many of my English readers may not be aware that the establishment of the tea-trade in the [[Himalaya]] and [[Assam]] is almost entirely the work of the superintendents of the gardens of [[Calcutta]] and Seharunpore.''"<ref>"Joseph Dalton Hooker, ''Himalayan Journals, or Notes of a Naturalist ...,'' Kew (1854), vol. I, p.&nbsp;5.</ref>

In 1887, when the [[Botanical Survey of India]] was set up to reform the country's [[botany|botanical sciences]], Saharanpur became the centre for the survey of the northern Indian [[flora]]. The Garden is seen historically as being second only to the [[Indian Botanical Gardens|Calcutta Gardens]] for its contribution to science and economy in India. Under private auspices today, it is full of greenery and has many different kinds of plants and flowers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/online-exhibitions/art-themes/india/more/lily_more_info.htm |title=Saharanpur Botanic Garden |access-date=23 October 2008 |archive-date=24 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324170058/http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/online-exhibitions/art-themes/india/more/lily_more_info.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>
