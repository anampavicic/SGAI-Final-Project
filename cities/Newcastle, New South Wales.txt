==History==

===European settlement===

[[File:Captain John Shortland.jpg|thumb|upright|Lieutenant [[John Shortland]], the first European to explore the Newcastle region.|left]]
In September 1797, Lieutenant [[John Shortland]] became the first European to explore the area. His discovery of the area was largely accidental; as he had been sent in search of a number of convicts who had seized a locally built vessel called ''Cumberland'' as she was sailing from [[Sydney Cove]].<ref name="newc">{{cite web|url=http://www.newcastle.nsw.gov.au/discover_newcastle/visit_our_libraries/discovery_and_founding_of_newcastle|title=Discovery and founding of Newcastle|publisher=[[Newcastle City Council]]|access-date=24 September 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724032922/http://www.newcastle.nsw.gov.au/discover_newcastle/visit_our_libraries/discovery_and_founding_of_newcastle|archive-date=24 July 2008}}</ref> While returning, Lt.

Over the next two years, coal mined from the area was the [[New South Wales]] colony's first export.<ref name="smh"/>

Newcastle gained a reputation as a "hellhole" as it was a place where the most dangerous convicts were sent to dig in the coal mines as harsh punishment for their crimes.<ref name="smh"/> By the start of the 19th century the mouth of the Hunter River was being visited by diverse groups of men, including coal diggers, timber-cutters, and more escaped convicts. [[Philip Gidley King]], the [[Governor of New South Wales]] from 1800, decided on a more positive approach to exploit the now obvious natural resources of the [[Hunter Valley]].<ref name="newc"/> In 1801, a convict camp called King's Town (named after the governor) was established to mine coal and cut timber. In the same year, the first shipment of coal was dispatched to Sydney. This settlement closed less than a year later.<ref name="smh"/>

A settlement was again attempted in 1804, as a place of secondary punishment for unruly convicts. The settlement was named Coal River, also Kingstown and then renamed Newcastle, after [[Newcastle upon Tyne|the English city]].<ref name="womens_weekly"/> The name first appeared by the commission issued by Governor King on 15 March 1804 to Lieutenant [[Charles Menzies (Royal Marines officer)|Charles Menzies]] of the [[Royal Marines|marine detachment]] on {{HMS|Calcutta|1795|6}}, then at [[Port Jackson]], appointing him superintendent of the new settlement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newcastle.edu.au/service/archives/coalriver/pdf/sg25thmarch1804.pdf |title=Sydney Gazette |date=25 March 1804 |access-date=24 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725070335/http://www.newcastle.edu.au/service/archives/coalriver/pdf/sg25thmarch1804.pdf |archive-date=25 July 2008 }}</ref> The new settlement, comprising [[convict]]s and a military guard, arrived at the Hunter River on 27 March 1804 in three ships: {{HMS|Lady Nelson|1798|6}}, the ''Resource'' and the ''[[James (ship)|James]]''.<ref name="newc"/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7509|title=The Logbooks of the Lady Nelson by Ida Lee|author=Ida Lee|publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]]|access-date=2 January 2008|archive-date=7 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007221408/http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7509|url-status=live}}</ref> The convicts were rebels from the 1804 [[Castle Hill convict rebellion]]. The link with [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], England (its namesake) and also whence many of the 19th-century coal miners came, is still obvious in some of the place-names—such as [[Jesmond, New South Wales|Jesmond]], [[Hexham, New South Wales|Hexham]], [[Wickham, New South Wales|Wickham]], [[Wallsend, New South Wales|Wallsend]] and [[Gateshead, New South Wales|Gateshead]]. [[Morpeth, New South Wales]] is a similar distance north of Newcastle as [[Morpeth, Northumberland]] is north of Newcastle upon Tyne.

Under Captain [[James Wallis (British Army officer)|James Wallis]], commandant from 1815 to 1818, the convicts' conditions improved, and a building boom began. Captain Wallis laid out the streets of the town, built the first church of the site of the present [[Christ Church Cathedral, Newcastle|Christ Church Cathedral]], erected the old gaol on the seashore, and began work on the breakwater which now joins [[Nobbys Head]] to the mainland. The quality of these first buildings was poor, and only the (much reinforced) breakwater survives. During this period, in 1816, the [[Christ Church School (Colony of NSW)|first school]] was built in Newcastle.<ref name="smh"/>

Newcastle remained a penal settlement until 1822, when the settlement was opened up to farming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/places/national/north-road/information.html|title=Old Great North Road more information|publisher=[[Government of Australia|Australian Government]]|access-date=24 September 2008|archive-date=18 August 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080818051627/http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/places/national/north-road/information.html|url-status=live}}</ref> As a penal colony, the military rule was harsh, especially at Limeburners' Bay, on the inner side of [[Stockton, New South Wales|Stockton]] peninsula. There, convicts were sent to burn oyster shells for making lime.<ref name="newc"/> Military rule in Newcastle ended in 1823. Prisoner numbers were reduced to 100 (most of these were employed on the building of the breakwater), and the remaining 900 were sent to [[Port Macquarie]].<ref name="smh"/>

===Civilian government and onwards===
{{See also|Shelling of Newcastle}}
[[File:Hunter St West, Newcastle, 1908.jpg|thumb|A parade of mounted soldiers along [[Hunter Street, Newcastle|Hunter Street]], c. 1908]]After removal of the last convicts in 1823, the town was freed from the infamous influence of the penal law. It began to acquire the aspect of a typical Australian pioneer settlement, and a steady flow of free [[settler]]s poured into the hinterland.

During the nineteenth century the formation of the [[Newcastle & Hunter River Steamship Company]]<ref>''An Early Link with the New South Wales Railways'' Wylie, R.F. [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], October 1954 pp126-128</ref> saw the establishment of regular steamship services from [[Morpeth, New South Wales|Morpeth]] and Newcastle with Sydney. The company had a fleet of freighters as well as several fast passenger vessels, including the PS ''Newcastle'' and the PS ''Namoi''. The ''Namoi'' had first-class cabins with the latest facilities.

Because of the coal supply, small ships plied between Newcastle and Sydney, [[Brisbane]], [[Melbourne]] and [[Adelaide]], carrying coal to gas works and bunkers for shipping, and railways. These were commonly known as [[sixty-miler]]s, referring to the nautical journey between Newcastle and Sydney. These ships continued in service until recent times.{{when|date=June 2016}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maritime.nsw.gov.au/newcastle.html|title=Ships And Shores And Trading Ports|publisher=NSW Maritime|access-date=11 July 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720023338/http://www.maritime.nsw.gov.au/newcastle.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archive-date = 20 July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://anmm.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=630&print=1&S=shopProductInfo&T=shopProductInfo&PRODUCTID=227 |title=The Sixty Miler |publisher=[[Australian National Maritime Museum]] |access-date=11 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907084254/http://www.anmm.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=630&print=1&S=shopProductInfo&PRODUCTID=227&T=shopProductInfo |archive-date=7 September 2007 }}</ref>{{wide image|Newcastle Rae 1849 SLNSW FL4652760.jpg|750px|Panorama of Newcastle, Australia, 1849, by John Rae}}

===1920s to present===

During [[World War II]], Newcastle was an important industrial centre for the Australian war effort. In 1942, the Japanese planned to [[attack on Sydney Harbour|attack Sydney Harbour]]. On the early hours of 8 June, the Japanese submarine {{ship|Japanese submarine|I-21|1940|2}} briefly shelled Newcastle.

Newcastle has one of the oldest theatre districts in Australia. [[Victoria Theatre (Newcastle)|Victoria Theatre]] on Perkins Street is the oldest purpose-built theatre in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/photos/2012/03/07/3447685.htm|title=Victoria Theatre, Newcastle|first=Carol|last=Duncan|publisher=[[ABC Newcastle]]|date=3 April 2012|access-date=2 August 2017|archive-date=5 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105192004/http://www.abc.net.au/local/photos/2012/03/07/3447685.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> The theatre district that occupied the area around what is now the [[Hunter Street, Newcastle|Hunter Street Mall]] vanished during the 1940s. The old city centre has seen some new apartments and hotels built in recent years, but the rate of commercial and retail occupation remains low while alternate suburban centres have become more important. The CBD itself is shifting to the west, towards the major urban renewal area known as "Honeysuckle". This renewal, to run for another 10 years, is a major part of arresting the shift of business and residents to the suburbs. Commercial renewal has been accompanied by cultural renaissance. There is a vibrant arts scene in the city including a highly regarded art gallery,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newcastle.nsw.gov.au/nag|title=Newcastle Art Gallery|access-date=29 March 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331180143/http://www.newcastle.nsw.gov.au/nag|archive-date=31 March 2015}}</ref> and an active Hunter Writers' Centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hwcentre.com/|title=Hunter Writers Centre|access-date=29 March 2015|archive-date=2 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402092924/http://hwcentre.com/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Recent fictional representations (for example Antoinette Eklund's 'Steel River') present a new vision of the city, using the city's historic past as a backdrop for contemporary fiction.

==Geography==
[[File:Newcastle - aerial images (3) (7445134654).jpg|thumb|An aerial view of central Newcastle and its surrounding metropolitan area, situated on the Hunter River]]
Newcastle is on the southern bank of the Hunter River mouth. The northern side is dominated by sand dunes, swamps and multiple river channels. A "green belt" protecting plant and wildlife flanks the city from the west (Watagan mountains) around to the north where it meets the coast just north of Stockton. Urban development is mainly restricted to the hilly southern bank. The small town of [[Stockton, New South Wales|Stockton]] sits opposite central Newcastle at the river mouth and is linked by ferry. Road access between Stockton and central Newcastle is via the [[Stockton Bridge]], a distance of {{cvt|20|km|0}}. Much of the city is undercut by the coal measures of the Sydney sedimentary basin, and what were once numerous coal-mining villages located in the hills and valleys around the port have merged into a single urban area extending southwards to [[Lake Macquarie (New South Wales)|Lake Macquarie]]. The Greater Newcastle area is situated right between the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]] and [[Mid North Coast]] regions, with the Central Coast bordering in the south and the Mid North Coast bordering in the north as well as other [[Hunter Region|Hunter]] local government areas (outside of Newcastle) bordering in the west and north-west.{{wide image|Newcastle ANZAC Walk.JPG|640px|align-cap=center|The ANZAC Walk, looking towards [[Merewether]] and the outer suburbs}}

===Parks===
[[File:Speers Point lakeside walk near wharf.jpg|thumb|Speers Point Park]]
Newcastle has several public parks including King Edward Park, which was designated in 1863. Features of the park include coastal views, a sunken garden and a Victorian rotunda.<ref>{{cite web |title=King Edward Park |url=https://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/newcastle-area/newcastle/attractions/king-edward-park |access-date=9 September 2020 |website=Visit NSW |archive-date=6 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806160255/https://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/newcastle-area/newcastle/attractions/king-edward-park |url-status=live }}</ref>
Another noteworthy park of Newcastle is Starrett Park in New Lambton, known for its playground and lush grass.<ref>{{cite web |date=23 April 2021 |title=Have Fun at the Playground at Novocastrian Park in New Lambton |url=https://newywithkids.com.au/novocastrian-park/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220316190422/https://newywithkids.com.au/novocastrian-park/ |archive-date=16 March 2022 |access-date=21 October 2022 |website=Newy with Kids}}</ref>

===Climate===
Newcastle has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') that is typical of the Australian east coast. Precipitation is heaviest in late autumn and early winter, while the second half of the year is slightly drier on average. The climate is generally moderated by the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the east. Summers are mostly warm and humid with periods of very dry and hot weather occasionally due to hot west to north-westerly winds, which can bring temperatures in excess of {{cvt|40|C|0}}. The highest recorded temperature was {{cvt|42.5|C|1}} on 18 January 2013 at the [[Nobbys Head]] weather station.<ref>{{cite web |title=Climate statistics for Australian locations |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_061055_All.shtml |access-date=1 March 2022 |website=[[Bureau of Meteorology]]|archive-date=21 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021164642/http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_061055_All.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref>

Winters are generally mild with drier conditions than summer on average. [[Cold front]]s affect the area and sometimes bring strong westerly winds behind them, but due to the [[southeast Australian foehn|foehn effect]] they generally [[rain shadow|provide clear conditions]] as the region lies leeward of the [[Great Dividing Range]].<ref>[https://www.willyweather.com.au/news/5291/rain+shadows.html Rain Shadows] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210922232632/https://www.willyweather.com.au/news/5291/rain+shadows.html |date=22 September 2021 }} by Don White. Australian Weather News. Willy Weather. Retrieved 24 May 2021.</ref> The lowest recorded temperature was {{cvt|1.8|C|1}} on 27 July 1986.<ref>{{cite web |title=Climate statistics for Australian locations |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_061055_All.shtml |access-date=1 March 2022 |website=Bureau of Meteorology|archive-date=21 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021164642/http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_061055_All.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Australian east coast low|East coast lows]] also impact Newcastle, sometimes delivering winds well above {{cvt|100|kph|0}} and torrential rainfall, usually lasting a couple of days. The east coast low in May 1974, the [[2007 New South Wales storms]] and April 2015 are extreme examples of this type of weather.

Newcastle is often quoted as being the [[List of cities in Australia by population|seventh-largest city in Australia]]. This is misleading as the area represented extends well beyond both the City of Newcastle and the Newcastle metropolitan area. The area, officially the Newcastle Statistical District, is referred to as [[List of suburbs in Greater Newcastle, New South Wales|Greater Newcastle]] or the Lower Hunter Region, which includes most parts of the Newcastle, Lake Macquarie, Cessnock, Maitland and Port Stephens local government areas and, as of 30 June 2009, has an estimated population of 540,796.<ref name="2006SDmap" /><ref name="gnbhunter" /><ref>{{cite web |date=30 March 2010 |title=3218.0 Population Estimates by Statistical District, 2001 to 2009 |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/subscriber.nsf/log?openagent&32180ds0004_2001-09.xls&3218.0&Data%20Cubes&AA7D3AF7B728C481CA2576F50011B0D8&0&2008-09&30.03.2010&Latest |access-date=5 November 2010 |work=3218.0 – Regional Population Growth, Australia, 2008–09 |publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] |archive-date=21 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210221050111/https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/WebPages/Attachment+Not+Found |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite their proximity, all of the LGAs in the region maintain their own individual identities, separate from Newcastle.

===19th and early 20th centuries===
====Coal====
Coal mining began in earnest on 3 May 1833 when the [[Australian Agricultural Company]] received land grants at Newcastle plus a 31-year monopoly on that town's coal traffic. Other collieries were within a {{cvt|16|km|0}} radius of the town. Principal coal mines were located at [[Stockton, New South Wales|Stockton]], [[Tighes Hill]], [[Carrington, New South Wales|Carrington]] and the Newcastle Coal and Copper Company's collieries at [[Merewether]] (includes the Glebe), [[Wallsend, New South Wales|Wallsend]] and the Waratah collieries. All operations had closed by the early 1960s.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

On 10 December 1831, the Australian Agricultural Company officially opened Australia's first railway, at the intersection of Brown & Church Streets, Newcastle. Privately owned and operated to service the ''A Pit'' coal mine, it was a [[cast-iron]] [[fishbelly rail]] on an inclined plane as a [[Cable railway#Gravity balance|gravitational railway]].<ref>[http://www.arhsnsw.com.au/docsrrc/rrcdload01.pdf Uncovering and understanding Australia's First Railway, Conference Paper, Campbell, D., Brougham, J. and Caldwell, R., Australian Journal of Multi-disciplinary Engineering, Vol. 7, No. 2, pp. 2–3, Engineering Heritage Australia, Newcastle, NSW] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222150336/http://www.arhsnsw.com.au/docsrrc/rrcdload01.pdf |date=22 February 2014 }}.

====Copper====
In the 1850s, a major copper smelting works was established at Burwood, near Merewether. An engraving of this appeared in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' on 11 February 1854.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sleekburnprints.com/1854-issue-illustrated-london-news-8660-burwood-copper-smelting-works-crimean-war-447-p.asp|title=1854 issue ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS 8660 Burwood Copper Smelting Works CRIMEAN WAR|website=SLEEKBURN PRINTS|language=en-GB|access-date=15 September 2018|archive-date=15 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915084631/https://www.sleekburnprints.com/1854-issue-illustrated-london-news-8660-burwood-copper-smelting-works-crimean-war-447-p.asp|url-status=dead}}</ref> The English and Australian Copper Company built another substantial works at [[Broadmeadow]] circa 1890, and in that decade the [[Cockle Creek Smelter]] was built.

====Soap====
The largest factory of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere was constructed in 1885, on an {{convert|8.9|ha|acre|adj=on}} site between the suburbs of Tighes Hill and Port Waratah, by [[Charles Upfold]], from London, for his Sydney Soap and Candle Company, to replace a smaller factory in Wickham.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sanclemente.mn.catholic.edu.au/our_school/history/timeline/1821/early%20days.htm|title=The early days of Mayfield|author=W.

At the Sydney International Exhibition they won a bronze medal "against all-comers from every part of the world", the only first prize awarded for soap and candles. Following World War I the company was sold to Messrs Lever & Kitchen (today [[Unilever]]), and the factory closed in the mid-1930s.

====Steel====
In 1911, [[BHP]] chose the city as the site for its steelworks due to the abundance of coal.<ref name="smh" /> The land put aside was prime real estate, on the southern edge of the harbour. In 1915, the [[Newcastle Steelworks]] opened, beginning a period of some 80 years dominating the steel works and heavy industry. As Mayfield and the suburbs surrounding the steelworks declined in popularity because of pollution, the steelworks thrived, becoming the region's largest employer.

===Economic challenges===
[[File:Newcastle from Fort Scratchley.jpg|alt=|thumb|Newcastle city centre from [[Fort Scratchley]]]]
Newcastle as a traditional area of heavy industry was not immune from the effects of economic downturns that plagued New South Wales and wider Australia since the 1970s. These downturns were particularly hard hitting for heavy industry which was particularly prevalent in Newcastle. The early 1990s recession caused significant job losses across Australia and the Newcastle region experienced a peak unemployment rate of 17% in February 1993, compared to 12.1% in New South Wales and 11.9% across Australia.<ref>{{cite web |date=15 November 2007 |title=6291.0.55.001 – Labour Force, Australia, Detailed – Electronic Delivery, Oct 2007 |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/allprimarymainfeatures/CAFF170479EFA891CA2573B600186D23?opendocument |access-date=15 July 2010 |publisher=Abs Government Australia |archive-date=18 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618194429/http://abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/allprimarymainfeatures/CAFF170479EFA891CA2573B600186D23?opendocument |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1999, the steelworks closed after 84 years' operation and had employed about 50,000 during its existence, many for decades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s55787.htm|title=Steel City without the Big Australian|publisher=ABC Online|date=29 September 1999|access-date=24 September 2008|archive-date=8 March 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000308060425/http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s55787.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> The closure of the BHP steelworks occurred at a time of strong economic expansion in Australia.

Since 2003, Australia experienced the effects of the [[2000s commodities boom]] as commodities prices for major [[export good]] such as coal and iron ore rose significantly. This provided a large incentive for investment in the Newcastle and Hunter region due to its status as a major coal mining and export hub to Asian markets. Large projects related to the coal industry helped to propel the Newcastle unemployment rate to 20 year lows and allow the Newcastle region to weather the effects of the [[late 2000s recession]] better than NSW as a whole.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/01/23/2144506.htm|title=$1bn funding secured for third coal loader|newspaper=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=23 January 2008|access-date=15 July 2010}}</ref> As of 2009, the two largest single employers are the Hunter New England Area Health Service and the [[University of Newcastle, Australia|University of Newcastle]].<ref name="autogenerated1" /> The [[National Stock Exchange of Australia]] (formerly Newcastle Stock Exchange) was formerly based in the city.

==Government and politics==
[[File:Newcastle Town Hall - 50732203368.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Newcastle City Hall (Australia)|Newcastle City Hall]]]]With its history as a traditionally working-class area, Newcastle has been a stronghold for the [[centre-left]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] at all levels of politics since [[Federation (Australia)|Federation]]. Labor currently holds every federal and state seat that overlaps at least partially with Newcastle.

The only area of Greater Newcastle where the [[centre-right]] [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] has ever been consistently competitive is the [[Port Stephens (New South Wales)|Port Stephens]] region in the north of the Newcastle metropolitan area, as well as in some beachside, middle-class suburbs near the Newcastle CBD such as [[Bar Beach, New South Wales|Bar Beach]] and [[Merewether, New South Wales|Merewether]]. The Port Stephens area is traditionally marginal and while historically was dominated by Labor, has been won by the Liberals.

One time the Liberals did win seats in Newcastle was at the [[2011 New South Wales state election|2011 state election]]. At this election, the [[incumbent]] [[New South Wales Labor Party|Labor]] government, led by then-[[Premier of New South Wales|Premier]] [[Kristina Keneally]], was defeated by the [[New South Wales Liberal Party|Liberal]]-[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]], led by then-[[Leader of the Opposition (New South Wales)|Opposition Leader]] [[Barry O'Farrell]], in a [[landslide victory|landslide]], suffering the worst ever defeat of a sitting government in New South Wales history and (at the time) the worst defeat of a sitting government anywhere in Australia since [[World War II]]. Labor won just 20 seats in the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]]; of these, only two ([[Electoral district of Cessnock|Cessnock]] and [[Electoral district of Wallsend|Wallsend]]) were in the [[Hunter Region]]. Before the election, the Liberal Party only held one seat in the entire Hunter Region (the seat of [[Electoral district of Port Stephens|Port Stephens]], which the party narrowly gained from Labor in [[2007 New South Wales state election|2007]]). However, at the subsequent state election in [[2015 New South Wales state election|2015]], although the Coalition retained [[majority government]] (and subsequently retained government again in [[2019 New South Wales state election|2019]] before Labor formed a [[minority government]] in [[2023 New South Wales state election|2023]]), the party lost all of its Hunter-based seats.[[File:Newcastle courthouse OIC.jpg|thumb|[[Newcastle Court House]]]]There are three [[Divisions of the Australian House of Representatives|federal electoral divisions]] that are mostly or entirely within Greater Newcastle: [[Division of Newcastle|Newcastle]] (covering the inner-city suburbs; this seat has only ever elected Labor MPs since it was created in [[List of Australian electorates contested at every election|1901]]), [[Division of Paterson|Paterson]] (covering the Port Stephens area as well as the nearby city of [[Maitland, New South Wales|Maitland]] and the town of [[Kurri Kurri]]; this seat is currently a marginal Labor seat that the Liberals have won previously, though it historically included more rural areas and did not include Maitland or Kurri Kurri) and [[Division of Shortland|Shortland]] (a fairly safe Labor seat that includes the eastern suburbs of the [[Lake Macquarie (New South Wales)|Lake Macquarie]] region in southern Newcastle, and extends to the far northeastern suburbs of the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]]). The traditionally Labor-held seat of [[Division of Hunter|Hunter]] (now a marginal Labor seat) is based around the western portion of the [[Hunter Region|Hunter]], but includes some western and Southern suburbs of Newcastle.

On the state level, there are five [[Electoral districts of New South Wales|electoral districts]] that are located entirely within Greater Newcastle; of these, four ([[Electoral district of Charlestown|Charlestown]], [[Electoral district of Newcastle|Newcastle]], [[Electoral district of Port Stephens|Port Stephens]] and [[Electoral district of Swansea|Swansea]]) are Labor seats while the remaining seat ([[Electoral district of Lake Macquarie|Lake Macquarie]]) is held by an [[Independent politicians in Australia|independent]].

Greater Newcastle also includes five [[Local government areas of New South Wales|local government area]]s (LGAs): the [[City of Newcastle]], the [[City of Lake Macquarie]], the [[City of Cessnock]], the [[City of Maitland]] and the [[Port Stephens Council]].

==Education==
===Primary and secondary schools===
[[File:Wickham Public School.jpg|thumb|Wickham Public School]]

[[Newcastle High School (Australia)|Newcastle High School]], which was formed by the merger of three schools, traces its lineage to a secondary school section initially founded on the grounds of Newcastle East Public School.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}

There are three selective state schools in the area:{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}
*[[Hunter School of the Performing Arts]], a fully selective Years 3–12 school, taking students only by audition
*[[Merewether High School]], a fully selective high school in the suburb of [[Broadmeadow]]
*Hunter Sports High School, a partially selective sporting high school, accepting around half its students from the local area and around half by audition

The three main independent schools in Newcastle are [[Newcastle Grammar School, New South Wales|Newcastle Grammar School]] Hunter Valley Grammar School, and [[St Philip's Christian College]], both coeducational K–12 schools.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}

The local area is also home to two [[Steiner school]]s: the Newcastle Waldorf School at Glendale in [[Lake Macquarie]], and the Linuwel Steiner School in [[East Maitland]].{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}
[[File:University of Newcastle.jpg|thumb|The [[University of Newcastle (Australia)|University of Newcastle]]'s city campus]]

===Tertiary and further education===
The city's main provider of tertiary education is the [[University of Newcastle, Australia|University of Newcastle]]. It was established in 1951 as a satellite campus of the [[University of New South Wales]] and obtained autonomy in 1965. The university now offers over 150 undergraduate and graduate courses to a student population of more than 38,000, including 7,000 international students from more than 113 countries. The main campus is in the suburb of [[Callaghan, New South Wales|Callaghan]] about {{cvt|12|km|0}} from the [[Central business district|CBD]].

There are three campuses of the [[TAFE NSW|Hunter Institute of TAFE]], one located in the Newcastle CBD, one in the suburb of [[Hamilton East, New South Wales|Hamilton East]] and the other located in the suburb of [[Tighes Hill]].

Newcastle has a variety of smaller theatres, but the main theatre in the CBD is now the ''[[Newcastle Civic Theatre|Civic]]'', at Wheeler Place, (seating capacity about 1,500), one of Australia's great historic theatres built during 1929 in [[Art Deco]] style. It hosts a wide range of musicals, plays, concerts, dance and other events each year. Newcastle previously boasted several large theatres, among them the oldest purpose-built theatre in Australia, the [[Victoria Theatre (Newcastle)|Victoria Theatre]] on Perkins Street (built 1876, capacity 1,750), saw touring international opera companies such as the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]], and other troupes, and played host to some of the greatest stars of the age, such as [[Dame Nellie Melba]], [[Gladys Moncrieff]] and [[Richard Tauber]] (it is now closed and derelict); the ''Century'', Nineways, [[Broadmeadow]] (built 1941, capacity 1,800)—although largely used as a cinema—was a popular Symphony orchestra venue (demolished 1990 after being severely damaged by the 1989 earthquake); the ''Hunter'' (capacity 1,000) at The Junction, had advanced modern stage facilities, but was eventually sold and demolished to make way for a motel that was destroyed by the 1989 earthquake. The decline in theatres and cinemas from the 1960s onwards was blamed on television.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

Newcastle has also been home to noted Australian actors, comedians and entertainers, including [[Sarah Wynter]], [[John Doyle (comedian)|John Doyle]] (part of comic act [[Roy & HG]]), [[Susie Porter]], [[Celia Ireland]], [[Yahoo Serious]] and [[Jonathan Biggins]]. The cast of the [[Tap Dogs]] show also come from Newcastle.<ref name="SMHArts" />

==Transport==
[[File:Newcastle Interchange 2022.jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[Newcastle Interchange]] is a major interchange for commuter rail, light rail and buses.]]
Like most major cities, the Newcastle metropolitan area has an extensive system of both road links and road based public transport services (bus, taxi etc.) which cover most areas of both [[City of Newcastle|Newcastle]] and [[City of Lake Macquarie|Lake Macquarie]] and which extend beyond the metropolitan area itself. Rail transport, however, is accessible to only a relatively small percentage of the population along the major rail transport routes and ferry services are restricted to those commuting between Newcastle and [[Stockton, New South Wales|Stockton]]. Within the metropolitan area the car remains the dominant form of transportation. Newcastle, like all major Australian urban centres, had a [[Trams in Newcastle, New South Wales|tram system]], but it was closed in 1950. In February 2019, trams returned to the city with the opening of the [[Newcastle Light Rail]].<ref>[https://transportnsw.info/news/2019/light-rail-in-newcastle-opening-from-monday-18-february Light rail in Newcastle opening from Monday 18 February] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204122512/https://transportnsw.info/news/2019/light-rail-in-newcastle-opening-from-monday-18-february |date=4 February 2019 }} [[Transport for NSW]] 3 February 2019</ref>

===Road===
Newcastle is connected to surrounding cities by the [[Pacific Motorway (Sydney-Newcastle)|Pacific Motorway]] (south), [[Hunter Expressway]] (west), [[New England Highway]] (west) and the [[Pacific Highway, Australia|Pacific Highway]] (north and south). [[Hunter Street, Newcastle|Hunter Street]] is the main shopping street in the Newcastle CBD and, along with King Street, is one of the major links to the Pacific Highway from the CBD. King Street provides direct access to the [[Newcastle Link Road]] and then the Pacific Motorway and Hunter Expressway.

{{Main|Buses in Newcastle, New South Wales}}

Bus services within Newcastle are operated by [[Newcastle Transport]]. Prior to July 2017, these were operated by [[Newcastle Buses & Ferries]]. [[Hunter Valley Buses]], [[Port Stephens Coaches]] and [[Rover Coaches]] also operate services into the CBD from other parts of the Hunter Region.

The network radiates from a bus terminal at [[Newcastle Interchange]]. Major interchanges are located at the [[University of Newcastle, Australia|University of Newcastle]], [[Wallsend, New South Wales|Wallsend]], [[Glendale, New South Wales|Glendale]], [[Warners Bay]], [[Belmont, New South Wales|Belmont]], [[Charlestown Square]] and [[Westfield Kotara]].

[[Greyhound Australia]], [[Premier Transport Group#Premier Motor Service|Premier Motor Service]] and [[Sid Fogg's]] long-distance services serve Newcastle.

===Rail===
The Newcastle area is serviced by two [[NSW TrainLink]] intercity lines providing local and regional commuter services terminating at [[Newcastle Interchange]] along the [[Newcastle railway line|Newcastle line]]. The [[Central Coast & Newcastle Line]] has twice-hourly train services to Sydney and the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]]. The [[Hunter Line]] has twice-hourly services to [[Maitland railway station|Maitland]] and less frequently to [[Scone railway station|Scone]] and [[Dungog railway station|Dungog]]. Two long-distance lines operate through the Newcastle area using [[Broadmeadow railway station|Broadmeadow station]]. These provide services to [[Moree railway station|Moree]], [[Armidale railway station|Armidale]], [[Roma Street railway station|Brisbane]] and Sydney.
[[File:Honeysuckle Light Rail Stop.jpg|thumb|The [[Newcastle Light Rail]] line at [[Honeysuckle, Newcastle|Honeysuckle]]]]
Newcastle once had rail passenger services to [[Belmont, New South Wales|Belmont]] and [[Toronto, New South Wales|Toronto]], on [[Lake Macquarie (New South Wales)|Lake Macquarie]], [[Wallsend, New South Wales|Wallsend]], [[Kurri Kurri]] and several towns and villages between Maitland and [[Cessnock, New South Wales|Cessnock]] on the [[South Maitland Railway]], but these lines have been closed. In the late-1990s there was intense debate about the future of the rail line into central Newcastle.

In December 2014, the Newcastle line was curtailed to [[Hamilton railway station, New South Wales|Hamilton]].<ref>[https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/2784964/last-train-leaves-newcastle-station-video/?cs=303 Last train leaves Newcastle station] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225213501/http://www.theherald.com.au/story/2784964/last-train-leaves-newcastle-station-video/?cs=303 |date=2014-12-25}} ''[[Newcastle Herald]]'' 26 December 2014</ref> A new [[Newcastle Interchange]] opened on 15 October 2017.<ref>{{cite web |date=1 October 2017 |title=Timetable changes Central Coast & Newcastle Line and Hunter Line |url=https://transportnsw.info/news/2017/timetable-change-central-coast-newcastle-line-hunter-line |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013053717/https://transportnsw.info/news/2017/timetable-change-central-coast-newcastle-line-hunter-line |archive-date=13 October 2017 |access-date=13 October 2017 |publisher=[[Transport for NSW]]}}</ref> The [[Newcastle Light Rail]] line also operates from here.<ref>[http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/projects-wickham-transport-interchange Wickham Transport Interchange] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615190205/http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/projects-wickham-transport-interchange |date=15 June 2016 }} Transport for NSW</ref><ref>[http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/newcastle-light-rail-announced Newcastle Light Rail Announced] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524032522/http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/newcastle-light-rail-announced |date=24 May 2014 }} Transport for NSW 23 May 2014</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2014/05/23/4010610.htm Light rail route for city finally unveiled] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515050318/http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2014/05/23/4010610.htm |date=15 May 2017 }} ''ABC News'' 23 May 2014</ref>

From 1924 until 1994, [[Broadmeadow Locomotive Depot]] was the main railway centre for the Hunter region. [[Cardiff Locomotive Workshops]] opened in 1928, primarily as a major repair centre for [[New South Wales Government Railways]] locomotives, although it did build twelve [[New South Wales C38 class locomotive|38 class]] and two [[New South Wales D58 class locomotive|58 class]] locomotives. Today it is operated by [[Downer Rail]] and along with [[UGL Rail]]'s Broadmeadow plant, remains active as a locomotive and rolling stock manufacturer and repairer.

The [[Port of Newcastle]] is crucial to the economic life of Newcastle and the Hunter Valley region beyond. Over 90 million tonnes of coal is shipped through the facility each year—making it the largest coal exporting port in the world.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jessica Darnbrough |date=21 January 2009 |title=Newcastle takes world's largest coal exporter crown |url=http://www.miningaustralia.com.au/news/newcastle-takes-world-s-largest-coal-exporter-crow |access-date=9 April 2015 |publisher=Mining Australia |archive-date=14 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414095945/http://www.miningaustralia.com.au/news/newcastle-takes-world-s-largest-coal-exporter-crow |url-status=live }}</ref> The Port of Newcastle claims to be Australia's first port.

===Airport===
[[Newcastle Airport, New South Wales|Newcastle Airport]] is located {{cvt|15|km|0}} north of the Newcastle CBD ({{cvt|27|km|0|disp=sqbr}} by road). The airport, which is a joint venture between [[City of Newcastle|Newcastle City Council]] and [[Port Stephens Council]], has experienced rapid growth since 2000 as a result of an increase in [[low-cost airline]] operations. The airport is located at [[RAAF Base Williamtown]], a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] base on land leased from the [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]].<ref>{{cite web |date=24 June 2005 |title=Media Release: Lease Extended For Newcastle Airport |url=http://www.minister.defence.gov.au/2005/10605.doc |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907180140/http://www.minister.defence.gov.au//2005/10605.doc |archive-date=7 September 2007 |access-date=11 April 2008 |publisher=[[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]] |format=DOC}};<br />{{cite web |date=24 June 2006 |title=Lease Term Extended For Newcastle Airport At RAAF Base Williamtown |url=http://www.patersononline.com/cgi-bin/engine.pl?Page=page.html&Rec=653 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611183934/http://www.patersononline.com/cgi-bin/engine.pl?Page=page.html&Rec=653 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=11 June 2008 |access-date=11 April 2008 |publisher=[[Bob Baldwin (politician)|Bob Baldwin]]}}</ref>

Newcastle Heliport operates alongside the lower section of Newcastle Harbour.

The suburb of [[Broadmeadow]] is home to the base of the [[Westpac Life Saver Rescue Helicopter Service]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Westpac Rescue Helicopter Service – Base and Hangars |url=http://www.rescuehelicopter.com.au/operations/base |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721162828/http://www.rescuehelicopter.com.au/operations/base |archive-date=21 July 2008 |access-date=24 September 2008 |publisher=[[Westpac Life Saver Rescue Helicopter Service]]}}</ref> The Helicopter service is one of the longest running services of this type in the world. Two helicopters operate out of this base and operate 24 hours a day.

The closure of [[Belmont Airport]], commonly referred to as Aeropelican, in the [[City of Lake Macquarie|Lake Macquarie]] suburb of [[Marks Point, New South Wales|Marks Point]] has caused Williamtown to become Newcastle's only major airport and residents in the south of the Newcastle metropolitan area must commute up to {{cvt|55|km|0}} by car to reach Williamtown.

==Sport==
===Rugby league===
Rugby league is the most popular sport in Newcastle, with the [[Newcastle Knights]] representing the city in the [[National Rugby League]]. The Knights play at the 33,000-capacity [[McDonald Jones Stadium]], situated in the suburb of {{NSWcity|New Lambton}}.

The [[Newcastle Rugby League]] holds local club competition and has done so since the early 1900s. Touring domestic and international teams would play against Newcastle's representative team which was made up of players from this league. The [[Newcastle & Hunter Rugby League]] is a community competition also based in the region which was created from a merger in 2007 of leagues which ran under various names since the mid-20th century, and is the largest community rugby league competition anywhere in the world. It generally features smaller teams compared to the Newcastle Rugby League.

McDonald Jones Stadium hosted the [[2016 Anzac Test]] between [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] and [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]].<ref>[http://www.nrl.com/representative-round-newcastle-to-host-test/tabid/10874/newsid/91436/default.aspx Representative Round: Newcastle to host Test] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008235554/http://www.nrl.com/representative-round-newcastle-to-host-test/tabid/10874/newsid/91436/default.aspx |date=8 October 2016 }} National Rugby League 25 January 2016</ref>

==Disasters==
===1989 earthquake===
{{Main|1989 Newcastle earthquake}}

On 28 December 1989, Newcastle experienced an earthquake measuring 5.6 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]], which killed 13 people, injured 162 and destroyed or severely damaged a number of prominent buildings. Some had to be demolished, including the large George Hotel in Scott Street (city), the Century Theatre at [[Broadmeadow]], the Hunter Theatre (formerly 'The Star') and the majority of The Junction school at Merewether. Part of the Newcastle Workers' Club, a popular venue, was destroyed and later replaced by a new structure. The following economic [[recession]] of the early 1990s meant that the city took several years to recover. However, [[Beaumont Street, Newcastle|Beaumont Street]], [[Hamilton, New South Wales|Hamilton]], where many buildings sustained major damage, became a thriving cosmopolitan restaurant strip after the earthquake and is still going strong today. The earthquake helped to rekindle business in this suburban strip.

===June 2007 Hunter Region and Central Coast storms===
[[File:Pasha Bulker grounded.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Pasha Bulker]]'' briefly became a local landmark when it was stranded on [[Nobbys Beach]] in 2007]]
{{Main|2007 New South Wales storms}}

On 8 June 2007 the Hunter and [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]] regions were battered by the worst series of storms to hit [[New South Wales]] in 30 years. This resulted in extensive flooding and nine deaths. Thousands of homes were flooded, and many were destroyed.<ref>Wikinews,

During the early stages of the storms, the {{Convert|225|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} bulk carrier ship ''[[Pasha Bulker]]'' ran aground at [[Nobbys Beach]] after failing to heed warnings to move offshore. After the first few attempts failed, the ''Pasha Bulker'' was refloated on the third [[Marine salvage|salvage]] attempt on 2 July 2007 despite earlier fears that the ship would break up. After initially entering the port for minor repairs, it departed under tow on 26 July 2007 for major repairs in Asia.

===Maritime===
On 12 July 1866, a paddle steamer the {{SS|Cawarra}}, on its way to [[Brisbane]] from Newcastle carrying 60 passengers, was caught in a storm as it made its way out of the harbour.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}} Sixty people died; coincidentally, one survivor, Frederick Hedges, was plucked from the water by the sole survivor of the ''[[Dunbar (ship)|Dunbar]]'' that had sunk in Sydney Harbour nine years earlier.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

The most tragic maritime accident of the 20th century in Newcastle occurred on 9 August 1934 when the Stockton-bound ferry ''Bluebell'' collided with the coastal freighter, ''Waraneen'', and sank in the middle of the Hunter River.<ref>{{cite news |date=11 August 1934 |title=Newcastle Fatality – Ferry Collides With Steamer |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2366583 |access-date=27 April 2009 |newspaper=The Canberra Times}}</ref> [[The Bluebell Collision]] claimed three lives and fifteen passengers were admitted to the [[Royal Newcastle Hospital|Newcastle Hospital]], with two suffering severely from the effects of immersion. It was later found that the ferry captain was at fault.<ref>{{cite news |date=25 August 1934 |title=Ferry at Fault |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2368361 |access-date=27 April 2009 |newspaper=The Canberra Times}}</ref>

These are only two events in Newcastle's very long history of shipwrecks including the 1974 beaching of the {{MV|Sygna}}, and the 2007 beaching of the ''[[Pasha Bulker]]''.

===Aviation===
On 16 August 1966, an [[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF]] [[CAC Sabre]] crashed into the inner-city suburb of [[The Junction, New South Wales|The Junction]].<ref name="flyby">{{cite web |date=15 August 2007 |title=Fly-Past To Honour Sabre Pilot |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/media/AlertTpl.cfm?CurrentId=6973 |access-date=25 April 2009 |publisher=Department of Defence |archive-date=14 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614232554/http://www.defence.gov.au/media/AlertTpl.cfm?CurrentId=6973 |url-status=live }}</ref> The pilot, Flying Officer Warren William Goddard, experienced engine troubles and unsuccessfully tried to get the plane over the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The Junction is a highly populated suburb of Newcastle and most of the plane wreckage landed in the shopping area of the suburb. In 2007 a memorial plaque was unveiled for the killed pilot.<ref name="flyby" />
