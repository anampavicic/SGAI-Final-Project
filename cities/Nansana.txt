==Overview==
Nansana is a high-density working-class neighborhood. Beginning in May 2017 a crime wave engulfed the town, involving the murder of young women in their 20s and 30s.<ref name="De">{{cite web|title=Uganda: Another Woman Striped, Killed in Nansana |access-date=5 August 2017|date=18 July 2017|last=Kato | location=Kampala | url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201707180057.html| first=Joseph | newspaper=[[Daily Monitor]] via [[AllAfrica.com]]}}</ref> As of 4 August 2017, a total of 10 young women have been murdered in Nansana, after being sexually molested.<ref name="Pro">{{cite web|access-date=4 August 2017|location=Kampala |last=Kiggundu|date=4 August 2017 |first=Joseph| url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Wakiso-RDC-wants-sex-workers-licensed/688334-4043924-1062y2rz/index.html |newspaper=[[Daily Monitor]] |title=Wakiso RDC wants sex workers licensed}}</ref> None of the murders have been solved.<ref>{{cite web|date=25 June 2017 |access-date=5 August 2017 |url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Six-women-raped-killed-similar-brutal-fashion/688334-3985858-4lfd0kz/index.html |title=6 women raped, killed in similar brutal fashion |newspaper=[[Daily Monitor]]|first=Stephen |last=Kafeero |location=Kampala}}</ref>  The local politicians have disagreed on what needs to be done. There are reasons to believe that some of the victims were engaged in prostitution and were killed when they disagreed with their customers. Ian Kyeyune, the Resident District Commissioner (RDC) for [[Wakiso District]] proposes to license all prostitutes in the town so that they are accorded protection by the government. However, Regina Bakitte, the mayor of Nansana, opposes the idea, arguing that this would encourage promiscuity in the town. Prostitution is illegal in Uganda.<ref name="Pro"/>
