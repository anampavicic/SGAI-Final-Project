'''Catbalogan''', officially the '''City of Catbalogan''' ({{langx|war|Siyudad han Catbalogan}}; {{langx|fil|Lungsod ng Catbalogan}}), is a 5th class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] and [[capital city]] of the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Samar (province)|Samar]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 106,440 people.{{PH census|current}}

It is Samar's main commercial, trading, educational, financial and political center. The city is the gateway to the region's three Samar provinces.

Catbalogan's [[patron saint]] is St. [[Bartholomew the Apostle]] whose feast day is August 24.

The [[8th Infantry Division (Philippines)|Philippine Army's 8th Infantry Division (Stormtroopers)]] is based at [[Camp Lukban|Camp General Vicente Lukban]], [[Maulong, Catbalogan|Barangay Maulong]], Catbalogan City. The camp is named in honor of [[Vicente Lukbán|Gen. Vicente Lukbán]], a Filipino officer in Gen. [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]'s staff during the [[Philippine Revolution]] and the politico-military chief of Samar and Leyte during the [[Philippine–American War]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://heyplaces.ph/01767/Catbalogan,_Samar|title=Catbalogan, Samar |website=heyplaces.ph}}</ref>

==History==
{{More citations needed section|date=July 2019}}
[[File:Catbalogan City 2016 stamp of the Philippines.jpg|thumb|left|upright|2016 stamp dedicated to the 400th anniversary of Catbalogan]]
Catbalogan was founded in October 1596 by Spanish [[Jesuit]] priests and became the capital of the entire island of Samar. Friar Francisco de Otazo, S.J., who arrived in the Philippines in 1596, founded the Catbalogan Mission and was thus the first missionary to bring the Catholic faith to the people of Catbalogan.

In 1627, Catbalogan was raised to the status of ''residencia'' (residence or central house) and among its dependencies were [[Paranas, Samar|Paranas]] where, in 1629, Fr. Pedro Estrada actively evangelized the area and Calbiga where he took whiterocks or grey limestone to use as building blocks for its church. The church has some arc-like stone roof that was pasted together to dry on each block, giving an arching force to the side. On October 17, 1768, Catbalogan was ceded to the [[Franciscan]]s who took over from the [[Jesuit]]s. The first Franciscan parish priest was [[Fray Jose Fayo]], OFM.

During the early days of [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines]] in the 16th century, Samar was under the jurisdiction of Cebu but later was declared a separate province. In 1735, [[Samar]] and [[Leyte]] were united into one province with [[Carigara]], in Leyte, as the capital. The union, however, did not prove satisfactory. In 1768, Catbalogan became the provincial capital when Samar separated from Leyte and became an independent province. Paranas (with Calbiga) was then separated from Catbalogan as an independent town. In 1882, Jiabong (with Motiong) separated from Catbalogan as an independent town.

On December 31, 1898, during the Philippine Revolution, Gen. Vicente Lukban arrived in Catbalogan and put Samar under his jurisdiction.

On January 27, 1900, the Americans captured Catbalogan during the [[Philippine–American War]] (1899–1902). On June 17, 1902, a provincial civil government was established on Samar Island by an act of the Philippine Commission with [[Julio A. Llorente|Julio Llorente]] of Cebu as the first governor of Samar.

On May 24, 1942, during [[World War II]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]] forces landed in Barrio Pangdan on early morning and occupied the capital. On October 28, 1944, American and Filipino forces liberated Catbalogan from the Japanese.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Communique No. 934, October 28, 1944 {{!}} GOVPH |url=https://mirror.officialgazette.gov.ph/1944/10/28/communique-no-934-october-28-1944/ |access-date=April 10, 2022 |website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines |language=en-US}}</ref>

In 1948, the barrios of Jiabong, Jiaan, Malino, San Fernando, Casapa, Camoroboan, Lologayan, Magcabitas, Paglayogan, Dogongan, Bayog, and Malobago were separated to form the municipality of [[Jiabong, Samar|Jiabong]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra269.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710053902/http://lawph.com/statutes/ra269.html |url-status = dead|archive-date=July 10, 2012 |title=An act creating the municipality of Jiabong, province of Samar |publisher=LawPH.com |access-date=April 8, 2011 }}</ref>

On June 19, 1965, the [[Philippine Congress]], along with the province's three congressmen, Eladio T. Balite (1st District), Fernando R. Veloso (2nd District) and Felipe J. Abrigo (3rd District), approved Republic Act No. 4221 dividing Samar into three provinces, namely [[Western Samar]], [[Eastern Samar]] and [[Northern Samar]], respectively.  Catbalogan thus ceased to be the capital of the whole island-province after enjoying the prestige of being the premier town of Samar for 197 years since 1768.

On June 21, 1969, under Republic Act No. 5650, Western Samar was renamed Samar with Catbalogan remaining as the capital.

The greatest calamities to occur in Catbalogan were big fires.  The April 1, 1957 conflagration, considered as the most destructive one, caused damage to properties in the amount of thirty million pesos. The next was on May 19, 1969, where damage was estimated at twenty million pesos and the more than century-old Saint Bartholomew Roman Catholic Church was razed to the ground.  Paradoxically, like the proverbial [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]], each time Catbalogan suffered under the throes of these calamities, better buildings and infrastructures emerged from the ashes.

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
{{Hatnote|For further information, see [[League of Cities of the Philippines v. COMELEC]].}}
As early as 1960, Catbalogan already agitated to become a city. In 1969, Rep. Fernando P. Veloso sponsored House Bill No. 1867 creating Catbalogan into a city. The bill was being deliberated in the [[Philippine Senate]], but the blaze of 1969 caused it to be shelved. Subsequent efforts were made by Catbalogan political leaders, including former Representative Catalino V. Figueroa, during his term, to make Catbalogan's cityhood dream a reality despite strong and rabid opposition by the League of Cities of the Philippines, particularly Catbalogan City's neighboring Calbayog under the administration of Mayor Mel Senen Sarmiento.

On March 15, 2007, Catbalogan finally attained its cityhood. Under the sponsorship of Senator [[Alfredo S. Lim]] and by virtue of Republic Act No. 9391, Catbalogan was converted into a component city known as the CITY of CATBALOGAN following a unanimous vote by the Philippine Senate. Senator [[Manuel Villar, Jr.]] (President of the Senate), Congressman [[Jose De Venecia, Jr.]] (Speaker of the House of Representatives), [[Oscar G. Yabes]] (Secretary of the Senate), [[Roberto P. Nazareno]] (Secretary General, House of Representatives) and [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] (President of the Philippines) were among its signatories.  The residents of Catbalogan overwhelmingly ratified this change through a [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Comelec]] [[plebiscite]] on June 16, 2007, with over 92% "Yes" votes for cityhood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samarisland.com/catbalogan-city-brief-history/|website=www.samarisland.com|title=Becoming Catbalogan City|access-date=December 27, 2018}}</ref>

However, Catbalogan temporarily lost its cityhood, along with 15 other cities, after the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]], in a very close 6–5 vote, granted a petition filed by the [[League of Cities of the Philippines]], and declared the cityhood law (RA 9391) which allowed the town to acquire its city status, unconstitutional.<ref>Rempillo, Jay B. (November 18, 2008) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120220010745/http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/news/courtnews%20flash/2008/11/11180803.php SC Voids 16 Cityhood Laws]. Court News Flash November 2008, Supreme Court of the Philippines</ref>

On December 10, 2008, Catbalogan and the other 15 cities affected filed a motion for reconsideration with the court.  More than a year later, on December 22, 2009, acting on said appeal, the court reversed its earlier ruling as it ruled that ''"at the end of the day, the passage of the amendatory law'' (regarding the criteria for cityhood as set by Congress) ''is no different from the enactment of a law, i.e., the cityhood laws specifically exempting a particular political subdivision from the criteria earlier mentioned. Congress, in enacting the exempting law/s, effectively decreased the already codified indicators."''<ref>Pulta, Benjamin B. (December 23, 2009) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120106050738/http://www.tribuneonline.org/nation/20091223nat1.html SC reverses self, upholds creation of 16 cities]. tribuneonline.org</ref>  As such, the cityhood status of Catbalogan was effectively restored.

On August 23, 2010, the court reinstated its ruling on November 18, 2008, causing Catbalogan and 15 cities to become regular municipalities. Finally, on February 15, 2011, Catbalogan became a city again including the 15 municipalities declaring that the conversion to cityhood met all legal requirements.

After six years of legal battle, in its board resolution, the [[League of Cities of the Philippines]] acknowledged and recognized the cityhood of Catbalogan and 15 other cities.

==Transportation==
[[File:Catbalogan Samar.jpg|thumb|[[Motorized tricycle (Philippines)|Motorized tricycle]] and [[Cycle rickshaw#Philippines|pedicabs]] are the main transportation mode within the vicinity of the city]]
For decades, Catbalogan City has served as Samar island's main maritime transport gateway as interisland vessels made its port of call at Catbalogan City Seaport before proceeding to Tacloban City.  As the advent of land transport became possible, the interisland maritime transport slowly ceased to operate.

Today, Catbalogan City is a major landport terminal and stopover for interisland bus lines coming and going between [[Luzon]] and [[Mindanao]] passing through the bridged island of [[Leyte]] and [[Samar]].

[[Catbalogan Airport]], also known as Buri Airport is the main airport of Catbalogan City.
