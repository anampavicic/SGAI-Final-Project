The ''[[Milwaukee Sentinel]]'' used ''Milwaukie'' in its headline until it switched to ''Milwaukee'' on November 30, 1844.<ref name="Legler" />

===Native American peoples===
Indigenous cultures lived along the waterways for thousands of years. The first recorded inhabitants of the Milwaukee area were various [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes: the [[Menominee]], [[Fox (tribe)|Fox]], [[Mascouten]], [[Sauk people|Sauk]], [[Potawatomi]], and [[Ojibwe]] (all Algic/Algonquian peoples), and the [[Ho-Chunk]] (Winnebago, a Siouan people). Many of these people had lived around [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]]<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Richard|title=The Middle Ground|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|page=146|isbn=9781139495684|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fHLfiOZVzmMC&pg=PA146}}</ref> before migrating to the Milwaukee area about the time of European contact.

In the second half of the 18th century, the Native Americans living near Milwaukee played a role in all the major European wars on the American continent. During the [[French and Indian War]], a group of "Ojibwas and Pottawattamies from the far [Lake] Michigan" (i.e., the area from Milwaukee to Green Bay) joined the French-Canadian [[Daniel Liénard de Beaujeu]] at the [[Battle of the Monongahela]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=William|title=Empires at War|year=2005|publisher=Walker & Company|location=New York|page=68|isbn=9780802719355|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XqukoiTFL_oC&pg=PA68}}</ref> In the [[American Revolutionary War]], the Native Americans around Milwaukee were some of the few groups to ally with the rebel Continentals.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Richard|title=The Middle Ground|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|page=400|isbn=9781139495684|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fHLfiOZVzmMC&pg=PA400}}</ref>

After the [[American Revolutionary War]], the Native Americans fought the United States in the [[Northwest Indian War]] as part of the [[Council of Three Fires]]. During the [[War of 1812]], they held a council in Milwaukee in June 1812, which resulted in their decision to attack [[Chicago]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Keating|first=Ann|title=Rising Up from Indian Country|year=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=137}}</ref> in retaliation against American expansion. This resulted in the [[Battle of Fort Dearborn]] on August 15, 1812, the only known armed conflict in Chicago. This battle convinced the American government to [[Indian Removal|remove]] these groups of Native Americans from their indigenous land.{{dubious|date=March 2023}} After being attacked in the [[Black Hawk War]] in 1832, the Native Americans in Milwaukee signed the [[1833 Treaty of Chicago]] with the United States. In exchange for ceding their lands in the area, they were to receive monetary payments and lands west of the Mississippi in [[Indian Territory]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Potawatomi Treaties and Treaty Rights {{!}} Milwaukee Public Museum|url=https://www.mpm.edu/content/wirp/ICW-107|access-date=March 2, 2021|website=www.mpm.edu}}</ref>

===European settlement and thereafter===

[[File:Solomon Juneau.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of [[Solomon Juneau]], who helped establish the city of Milwaukee]]

Europeans arrived in the Milwaukee area before the 1833 Treaty of Chicago. French missionaries and traders first passed through the area in the late 17th and 18th centuries. Alexis Laframboise, coming from Michilimackinac (now in Michigan), settled a trading post in 1785 and is considered the first resident of European descent in the Milwaukee region.<ref name="St-Pierre, T 1895">St-Pierre, T.

{{blockquote|[O]ne day during the thirties of the last century [1800s] a newspaper calmly changed the name to Milwaukee, and Milwaukee it has remained until this day.<ref name="WGBruce">{{cite book|last=Bruce|first=William George|year=1936|title=A Short History of Milwaukee|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|publisher=The Bruce Publishing Company|pages=15–16|lccn=36010193}}</ref>}}
The spelling "Milwaukie" lives on in [[Milwaukie]], [[Oregon]], named after the Wisconsin city in 1847, before the current spelling was universally accepted.<ref>{{Cite web|date=August 3, 2016|title=From Milwaukee, Wis. to Milwaukie, Ore.|url=https://onmilwaukee.com/articles/milwaukieore|access-date=March 2, 2021|website=OnMilwaukee}}</ref>

Milwaukee has three "[[Father of the Nation|founding fathers]]": [[Solomon Juneau]], [[Byron Kilbourn]], and [[George H. Walker]]. Solomon Juneau was the first of the three to come to the area, in 1818. He founded a town called Juneau's Side, or Juneautown, that began attracting more settlers. In competition with Juneau, Byron Kilbourn established Kilbourntown west of the [[Milwaukee River]]. He ensured the roads running toward the river did not join with those on the east side. This accounts for the large number of angled bridges that still exist in Milwaukee today.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/bridges/|title=Bridges {{!}} Encyclopedia of Milwaukee|website=emke.uwm.edu|access-date=October 3, 2018}}</ref> Further, Kilbourn distributed maps of the area which only showed Kilbourntown, implying Juneautown did not exist or the river's east side was uninhabited and thus undesirable. The third prominent developer was George H. Walker. He claimed land to the south of the Milwaukee River, along with Juneautown, where he built a log house in 1834. This area grew and became known as Walker's Point.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Walker's Point|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/walkers-point/|access-date=March 2, 2021|website=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee}}</ref>

The first large wave of settlement to the areas that would later become Milwaukee County and the City of Milwaukee began in 1835, following removal of the tribes in the Council of Three Fires. Early that year it became known that Juneau and Kilbourn intended to lay out competing town-sites. By the year's end both had purchased their lands from the government and made their first sales. There were perhaps 100 new settlers in this year, mostly from New England and other Eastern states. On September 17, 1835, the first election was held in Milwaukee; the number of votes cast was 39.<ref>{{Source-attribution|sentence=yes|{{Cite book|title=Memoirs of Milwaukee County from the Earliest Historical Times ..., Vol. I|last=Watrous|first=Jerome A.|publisher=Western Historical Association|year=1909|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XD4VAAAAYAAJ&q=editions:Jqsw4p18KfAC|location=Madison, Wisconsin|pages=265–267}}}}</ref>

By 1840, the three towns had grown, along with their rivalries. There were intense battles between the towns, mainly Juneautown and Kilbourntown, which culminated with the [[Milwaukee Bridge War]] of 1845. Following the Bridge War, on January 31, 1846, the towns were combined to incorporate as the City of Milwaukee, and elected Solomon Juneau as Milwaukee's first mayor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://192.159.83.40/SOS/pdf/THEOSOS_025/images/00014104.pdf|title=City of Milwaukee Incorporated, page 164, 1846; page 314, 1851|access-date=April 8, 2007|author=City of Milwaukee|publisher=Office of the Secretary of State of Wisconsin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070605144656/http://192.159.83.40/SOS/pdf/THEOSOS_025/images/00014104.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archive-date=June 5, 2007}}</ref>

Milwaukee began to grow as a city as high numbers of immigrants, mainly [[Germans|German]], made their way to Wisconsin during the 1840s and 1850s. Scholars classify [[German immigration to the United States]] in three major waves, and Wisconsin received a significant number of immigrants from all three. The first wave from 1845 to 1855 consisted mainly of people from [[Southwestern Germany]], the second wave from 1865 to 1873 concerned primarily [[Northwestern Germany]], while the third wave from 1880 to 1893 came from [[Northeastern Germany]].<ref name="Bungert, Heike 2006">Bungert, Heike, Cora Lee Kluge and Robert C. Ostergren. ''Wisconsin German Land and Life''. Madison: [[Max Kade Institute]] for German-American Studies, 2006.</ref> In the 1840s, the number of people who left German-speaking lands was 385,434, in the 1850s it reached 976,072, and an all-time high of 1.4&nbsp;million immigrated in the 1880s. In 1890, the 2.78&nbsp;million first-generation German Americans represented the second-largest foreign-born group in the United States. Of all those who left the German lands between 1835 and 1910, 90 percent went to the United States, most of them traveling to the Mid-Atlantic states and the Midwest.<ref name="Bungert, Heike 2006" />

By 1900, 34 percent of Milwaukee's population was of German background.<ref name="Bungert, Heike 2006" /> The largest number of German immigrants to Milwaukee came from [[Prussia]], followed by [[Bavaria]], [[Saxony]], [[Hanover]], and [[Hesse-Darmstadt]]. Milwaukee gained its reputation as the most German of American cities not just from the large number of German immigrants it received, but for the sense of community which the immigrants established here.<ref name="Conzen, Kathleen Neils 1860">Conzen, Kathleen Neils. ''Immigrant Milwaukee, 1836–1860''. Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England: [[Harvard University Press]], 1976.</ref>

Most German immigrants came to Wisconsin in search of inexpensive farmland.<ref name="Conzen, Kathleen Neils 1860" /> However, immigration began to change in character and size in the late 1840s and early 1850s, due to the [[Revolutions of 1848|1848 revolutionary movements in Europe]].<ref>Conzen, Kathleen Neils. {{" '}}The German Athens' Milwaukee and the Accommodation of Its Immigrants 1836–1860." PhD diss., vol. 1, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1972.</ref> After 1848, hopes for a united Germany had failed, and revolutionary and radical Germans, known as the "[[Forty-Eighters]]", immigrated to the U.S. to avoid imprisonment and persecution by German authorities.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Dippel|first1=Christian|last2=Heblich|first2=Stephan|date=May 24, 2020|title=Leadership and Social Movements: The Forty-Eighters in the Civil War|url=https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty_pages/christian.dippel/48ers_paper.pdf|access-date=March 2, 2021|website=UCLA Anderson|page=7|archive-date=January 12, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210112150246/https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty_pages/christian.dippel/48ers_paper.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

One of the most famous "liberal revolutionaries" of 1848 was [[Carl Schurz]]. He later explained in 1854 why he came to Milwaukee,
<blockquote>"It is true, similar things [cultural events and societies] were done in other cities where the Forty-eighters {{sic}} had congregated. But so far as I know, nowhere did their influence so quickly impress itself upon the whole social atmosphere as in 'German Athens of America' as Milwaukee was called at the time."<ref>"[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Content.aspx?dsNav=Ny:True,Ro:0,N:4294963828-4294963788&dsNavOnly=Ntk:All%7cMilwaukee+and+Watertown+as+Seen+by+Schurz+in+1854%7c3%7c,Ny:True,Ro:0&dsRecordDetails=R:BA4176&dsDimensionSearch=D:Milwaukee+and+Watertown+as+Seen+by+Schurz+in+1854,Dxm:All,Dxp:3&dsCompoundDimensionSearch=D:Milwaukee+and+Watertown+as+Seen+by+Schurz+in+1854,Dxm:All,Dxp:3 Milwaukee and Watertown as Seen by Schurz in 1854]". ''The Milwaukee Journal'', October 21, 1941. Accessed February 5, 2013.</ref></blockquote>

Schurz was referring to the various clubs and societies Germans developed in Milwaukee. The pattern of German immigrants settling near each other encouraged the continuation of the German lifestyle and customs. This resulted in [[German language]] organizations that encompassed all aspects of life; for example, singing societies and gymnastics clubs. Germans also had a lasting influence on the American school system. [[Kindergarten]] was created as a pre-school for children, and sports programs of all levels, as well as music and art, were incorporated as elements of the regular school curriculum. These ideas were first introduced by radical-democratic German groups, such as the Turner Societies, known today as the [[American Turners]]. Specifically in Milwaukee, the American [[Turners]] established its own [[Normal College]] for teachers of physical education and the [[University School of Milwaukee|German-English Academy]].<ref>Rippley, LaVern J. and Eberhard Reichmann, trans.

Milwaukee's German element is still strongly present today. The city celebrates its German culture by annually hosting a German Fest in July<ref>{{Cite web|date=February 5, 2021|title=Milwaukee's German Fest canceled over COVID-19 concerns|url=https://www.tmj4.com/news/local-news/milwaukees-german-fest-canceled-over-covid-19-concerns|access-date=March 2, 2021|website=TMJ4|language=en}}</ref> and an [[Oktoberfest]] in October.

Although the German presence in Milwaukee after the Civil War remained strong and their largest wave of immigrants had yet to land, other groups also made their way to the city. Foremost among these were [[Polish people|Polish]] immigrants. The Poles had many reasons for leaving their homeland, mainly poverty and political oppression. Because Milwaukee offered the Polish immigrants an abundance of low-paying entry-level jobs, it became one of the largest [[Polish settlements in the USA]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Introduction {{!}} Milwaukee Polonia|url=https://uwm.edu/mkepolonia/introduction/|access-date=March 2, 2021|language=en-US}}</ref>

For many residents, [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee#South Side|Milwaukee's South Side]] is synonymous with the [[#Polish immigrants|Polish community]] that developed here. The group maintained a high profile here for decades, and it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that families began to disperse to the southern suburbs.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Poles|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/poles/|access-date=March 2, 2021|website=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee|language=en-US}}</ref>

By 1850, there were seventy-five Poles in [[Milwaukee County]] and the [[US Census]] shows they had a variety of occupations: grocers, blacksmiths, tavernkeepers, coopers, butchers, broommakers, shoemakers, draymen, laborers, and farmers. Three distinct Polish communities evolved in Milwaukee, with the majority settling in the area south of Greenfield Avenue. Milwaukee County's Polish population of 30,000 in 1890 rose to 100,000 by 1915. Poles historically have had a strong national cultural and social identity, often maintained through the [[Catholic Church]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Nation of Polonia {{!}} Polish/Russian {{!}} Immigration and Relocation in U.S. History {{!}} Classroom Materials at the Library of Congress {{!}} Library of Congress|url=https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/immigration/polish-russian/the-nation-of-polonia/|access-date=March 2, 2021|website=Library of Congress}}</ref> A view of Milwaukee's South Side skyline is replete with the steeples of the many churches these immigrants built that are still vital centers of the community.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

[[St. Stanislaus Catholic Church (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|St. Stanislaus Catholic Church]] and the surrounding [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee|neighborhood]] was the center of [[Polish people|Polish]] life in Milwaukee.

By 1925, around 9,000 [[Mexican Americans|Mexicans]] lived in Milwaukee, but the [[Great Depression]] forced many of them to move back south. In the 1950s, the Hispanic community was beginning to emerge. They arrived for jobs, filling positions in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors. During this time there were labor shortages due to the immigration laws that had reduced immigration from Eastern and Southern Europe.

In 1892, [[Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin|Whitefish Bay]], [[South Milwaukee]], and [[Wauwatosa]] were incorporated. They were followed by [[Cudahy, Wisconsin|Cudahy]] (1895), North Milwaukee (1897) and East Milwaukee, later known as [[Shorewood, Wisconsin|Shorewood]], in 1900. In the early 20th century, [[West Allis]] (1902), and [[West Milwaukee]] (1906) were added, which completed the first generation of "inner-ring" suburbs.

In the 1920s, [[Chicago]] gangster activity came north to Milwaukee during the [[Prohibition era]]. [[Al Capone]], noted Chicago mobster, owned a home in the Milwaukee suburb [[Brookfield, Wisconsin|Brookfield]], where [[moonshine]] was made. The house still stands on a street named after Capone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brookfieldnow.com/news/102435199.html|date=November 11, 2010|title=It's everyday life that keeps local historian fascinated: But the Hollywood- worthy moments aren't bad, either?|author=Nan Bialek}}</ref>

In the 1930s the city was severely segregated via "redlining". In 1960, African-American residents made up 15 percent of the Milwaukee's population, yet the city was still among the most segregated of that time. As of 2019, at least three out of four black residents in Milwaukee would have to move in order to create "racially integrated" neighborhoods.<ref name="Leah Foltman & Malia Jones"/>

By 1960, Milwaukee had grown to become one of the largest cities in the United States. Its population peaked at 741,324. In 1960, the Census Bureau reported city's population as 91.1% white and 8.4% black.<ref>{{cite web|title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html|archive-date=August 12, 2012}}</ref>

By the late 1960s, Milwaukee's population had started to decline as people moved to suburbs, aided by ease of highways and offering the advantages of less crime, new housing, and lower taxation.<ref>Glabere, Michael. "Milwaukee:A Tale of Three Cities" in, ''From Redlining to Reinvestment: Community Responses to Urban Disinvestment'' edited by Gregory D. Squires. Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2011; p. 151 and ''passim''</ref> Milwaukee had a population of 594,833 by 2010, while the population of the overall metropolitan area increased. Given its large immigrant population and historic neighborhoods, Milwaukee avoided the severe declines of some of its fellow "[[Rust Belt]]" cities.

Since the 1980s, the city has begun to make strides in improving its economy, neighborhoods, and image, resulting in the revitalization of neighborhoods such as the [[Historic Third Ward]], [[Lincoln Village, City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Lincoln Village]], the [[East Side, Milwaukee|East Side]], and more recently Walker's Point and [[Bay View, Milwaukee|Bay View]], along with attracting new businesses to its downtown area. These efforts have substantially slowed the population decline and have stabilized many parts of Milwaukee.

North–south streets are numbered, and east–west streets are named. However, north–south streets east of 1st Street are named, like east–west streets. The north–south numbering line is along the Menomonee River (east of Hawley Road) and Fairview Avenue/Golfview Parkway (west of Hawley Road), with the east–west numbering line defined along 1st Street (north of Oklahoma Avenue) and Chase/Howell Avenue (south of Oklahoma Avenue). This numbering system is also used to the north by [[Mequon]] in [[Ozaukee County]], and by some [[Waukesha County]] communities.

Milwaukee is crossed by [[Interstate 43]] and [[Interstate 94]], which come together [[Downtown Milwaukee|downtown]] at the [[Marquette Interchange]]. The [[Interstate 894]] bypass (which as of May 2015 also contains [[Interstate 41]]) runs through portions of the city's southwest side, and [[Interstate 794]] comes out of the Marquette interchange eastbound, bends south along the lakefront and crosses the harbor over the [[Hoan Bridge]], then ends near the [[Bay View, Milwaukee|Bay View]] [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee|neighborhood]] and becomes the "Lake Parkway" ([[Wisconsin Highway 794|WIS-794]]).

One of the distinctive traits of Milwaukee's residential areas are the neighborhoods full of so-called [[Polish flat]]s. These are two-[[family]] [[home]]s with separate entrances, but with the units stacked one on top of another instead of side-by-side. This arrangement enables a family of limited means to purchase both a home and a modestly priced [[rental]] [[apartment]] unit. Since [[Polish-American]] immigrants to the area prized land ownership, this solution, which was prominent in their areas of settlement within the city, came to be associated with them.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cross|first=John A.|title=Ethnic Landscapes of America|publisher=Springer|year=2017|isbn=978-3-319-54009-2|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=310}}</ref>

The tallest building in the city is the [[U.S. Bank Center (Milwaukee)|U.S. Bank Center]], completed in 1973. In 2024 ''[[Architectural Digest]]'', a prominent design publication, rated Milwaukee’s skyline as the 15th most beautiful skyline in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|last=McLaughlin|first=Katherine|date=2024-06-26|title=The 17 Most Beautiful Skylines in the World|url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/the-most-beautiful-skylines-in-the-world|access-date=2024-07-03|website=Architectural Digest|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Climate===
{{see also|Climate change in Wisconsin}}
[[File:Milwaukee November 2022 17 (W. Wisconsin Avenue from Milwaukee Skywalk).jpg|thumb|right|220px|West Wisconsin Avenue from the Milwaukee Skywalk]]
Milwaukee's location in the [[Great Lakes Region]] often has rapidly changing weather, producing a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfa''), with cold, snowy winters, and hot, humid summers. The warmest month of the year is July, with a mean temperature of {{convert|73.3|F|1}}, while January is the coldest month, with a mean temperature of {{convert|24.0|F|1}}.

Because of Milwaukee's proximity to Lake Michigan, a convection current forms around mid-afternoon in light wind, resulting in the so-called "lake breeze" – a smaller scale version of the more common [[sea breeze]]. The lake breeze is most common between March and July. This onshore flow causes cooler temperatures to move inland usually {{convert|5|to|15|mi|0}}, with much warmer conditions persisting further inland. Because Milwaukee's official climate site, [[Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport]], is only {{convert|3|mi}} from the lake, seasonal temperature variations are less extreme than in many other locations of the [[Milwaukee metropolitan area]].

As the sun sets, the convection current reverses and an offshore flow ensues causing a land breeze. After a land breeze develops, warmer temperatures flow east toward the lakeshore, sometimes causing high temperatures during the late evening. The lake breeze is not a daily occurrence and will not usually form if a southwest, west, or northwest wind generally exceeds {{convert|15|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The lake moderates cold air outbreaks along the lakeshore during winter months.

Aside from the lake's influence, overnight lows in downtown Milwaukee year-round are often much warmer than suburban locations because of the [[urban heat island effect]]. Onshore winds elevate daytime [[relative humidity]] levels in Milwaukee as compared to inland locations nearby.

Thunderstorms in the region can be dangerous and damaging, bringing [[hail]] and high winds. In rare instances, they can bring a [[tornado]]. However, almost all summer rainfall in the city is brought by these storms. In spring and fall, longer events of prolonged, lighter rain bring most of the [[precipitation]]. A moderate snow cover can be seen on or linger for many winter days, but even during meteorological winter, on average, over 40% of days see less than {{convert|1|in|cm|1}} on the ground.<ref name="NOAA txt" />

Milwaukee tends to experience highs that are {{convert|90|°F|0}} or above on about nine days per year, and lows at or below {{convert|0|°F|0}} on six to seven nights.<ref name="NOAA txt" /> Extremes range from {{convert|105|F|C|abbr=on}} set on July 24, 1934, down to {{convert|−26|F|0}} on both January 17, 1982, and February 4, 1996.<ref name = NOAA /> The 1982 event, also known as [[Cold Sunday]], featured temperatures as low as {{convert|−40|°F|0}} in some of the [[suburb]]s as little as {{convert|10|mi}} to the north of Milwaukee.

====Climate change====
According to the United States' [[Environmental Protection Agency]], Milwaukee is threatened by ongoing [[climate change]] which is warming the planet. These risks include worsened heat waves because many of its residents do not possess [[air conditioner]]s, concerns about the water quality of Lake Michigan, and increased chances of flooding from intense rainstorms.<ref name="EPA">{{cite web|url=https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/climate-change-wi.pdf|title=What Climate Change Means for Wisconsin|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=August 2016}}</ref> In 2018, Milwaukee mayor [[Tom Barrett (Wisconsin politician)|Tom Barrett]] announced that the city would uphold its obligations under the [[Paris Agreement]], despite the United States' withdrawal, and set a goal moving a quarter of the city's electricity sources to renewable energy by 2025. These have included expansions in the city's solar power-generating capacity and a [[wind turbine]]'s installation near the Port of Milwaukee. Other actions being taken include local incentives for energy-saving upgrades to homes and businesses.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Henderson|first=Alison|url=https://shepherdexpress.com/news/features/milwaukee-remains-committed-to-the-paris-climate-agreement/|title=Milwaukee Remains Committed to the Paris Climate Agreement|date=April 17, 2020|work=[[Shepherd Express]]|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 4, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804010205/https://shepherdexpress.com/news/features/milwaukee-remains-committed-to-the-paris-climate-agreement/}}</ref>

===Water===
In the 1990s and 2000s, Lake Michigan experienced large [[algae blooms]], which can threaten aquatic life. Responding to this problem, in 2009 the city became an "Innovating City" in the [[United Nations Global Compact|Global Compact]] Cities Program. The Milwaukee Water Council was also formed in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thewatercouncil.com/wp-content/uploads/Our_History_Web_4-19-19.pdf|title=Our History|publisher=Milwaukee Water Council|website=Thewatercouncil.com}}</ref> Its objectives were to "better understand the processes related to freshwater systems dynamics" and to develop "a policy and management program aimed at balancing the protection and utilization of freshwater". The strategy used the [[Circles of Sustainability]] method.

[[St. Josaphat Basilica]] was the first church to be given the Basilica honor in Wisconsin and the third in the United States. [[Holy Hill National Shrine of Mary, Help of Christians]], northwest of Milwaukee, in [[Hubertus, Wisconsin]], was also made a Basilica in 2006.

Milwaukee is home for several [[Lutheran]] synods, including the [[Greater Milwaukee Synod]] of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]; the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS), which operates [[Concordia University Wisconsin]] in [[Mequon]] and [[Milwaukee Lutheran High School]], the nation's oldest Lutheran high school; and the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] (WELS), which was founded in 1850 in Milwaukee.

==Economy==

===Early economy===
Milwaukee was situated as a port city and a center for collecting and distributing produce. Some of the new [[immigrants]] who were settling into the new state of Wisconsin during the middle of the 19th century were wheat farmers. By 1860, Wisconsin was one of the major producers of wheat. [[Rail transport]] was needed to transport this grain from the wheat fields of Wisconsin to Milwaukee's harbor. Improvements in railways at the time made this possible.<ref>{{cite web|title=Milwaukee History|url=https://milwaukeehistory.net/education/milwaukee-timeline/|access-date=May 4, 2024}}</ref>

There was intense competition for markets with [[Chicago]], situated across the state line in [[Illinois]], and, to a lesser degree, with [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]] and [[Kenosha]] in Wisconsin. Eventually Chicago won out due to its superior financial markets and transportation position, including the [[Chicago Portage]] and being the hub of the railroad lines in the United States. Milwaukee did solidify its place as the commercial capital of Wisconsin and an important market in the Midwest.<ref name="milwaukeehistory.net" />

[[File:Menomonee Valley.jpg|thumb|[[Rail tracks]] along the industrial [[Menomonee Valley]], ancestral home of the [[Menominee]] Indians]]
Because of its easy access to Lake Michigan and other waterways, Milwaukee's [[Menomonee Valley]] has historically been home to [[manufacturing]], [[Meat packing industry|stockyards]], [[Rendering (food processing)|rendering plants]], [[shipping]], and other [[heavy industry]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Menomonee River Valley – History|url=https://www.thevalleymke.org/history|access-date=March 2, 2021|website=Menomonee River Valley|language=en-US}}</ref> Manufacturing was concentrated on the north side, with a peak of over 50 manufacturers in that industrialized area.<ref name="master">{{Cite news|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 29, 2023|access-date=June 29, 2023|language=en-GB|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/29/master-lock-milwaukee-plant-closure-manufacturing-holdout|title=Master Lock's Milwaukee plant to close after 100 years and send jobs abroad|first=Michael|last=Sainato|oclc=60623878|issn=1756-3224}}</ref>

Reshaping of the valley began with the [[railroads]] built by city co-founder [[Byron Kilbourn]] to bring product from Wisconsin's farm interior to the port. By 1862 Milwaukee was the largest shipper of [[wheat]] on the planet, and related industry developed. [[Grain elevator]]s were built and, due to Milwaukee's dominant [[German American|German immigrant population]], [[breweries]] sprang up around the processing of [[barley]] and [[hops]]. A number of [[tanneries]] were constructed, of which the [[Pfister & Vogel]] tannery grew to become the largest in America.

In 1843 George Burnham and his brother Jonathan opened a [[brickyard]] near 16th Street. When a durable and distinct cream-colored brick came out of the clay beds, other brickyards sprang up to take advantage of this resource. Because many of the city's buildings were built using this material it earned the nickname "Cream City", and consequently the brick was called [[Cream City brick]]. By 1881 the Burnham brickyard, which employed 200 men and peaked at 15&nbsp;million bricks a year, was the largest in the world.

[[Flour mills]], packing plants, breweries, railways and tanneries further industrialized the valley. With the [[marsh]]lands drained and the [[Kinnickinnic River (Milwaukee River)|Kinnickinnic]] and [[Milwaukee River]]s dredged, attention turned to the valley.

Along with the processing industries, bulk commodity storage, machining, and manufacturing entered the scene. The valley was home to the [[Milwaukee Road]], [[Falk Corporation]], [[Cutler-Hammer]], [[Harnischfeger Corporation]], [[Chain Belt Company]], [[Nordberg Manufacturing Company]] and other industry giants.

Early in the 20th century, Milwaukee was home to several pioneer [[brass era]] [[automobile]] makers, including Ogren (1919–1922).<ref>{{cite book|last=Clymer|first=Floyd|title=Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877–1925|location=New York|publisher=Bonanza Books|year=1950|page=153}}</ref>

===Brewing===
{{further|Beer in Milwaukee}}
[[File:Miller Brewery.png|thumb|The [[Miller Brewing Company|Miller Brewery]] viewed from the Wisconsin Avenue Bridge]]
Milwaukee became synonymous with [[Germans]] and [[beer]] beginning in the 1840s. The Germans had long enjoyed beer and set up breweries when they arrived in Milwaukee. By 1856, there were more than two dozen breweries in Milwaukee, most of them owned and operated by Germans. Besides making beer for the rest of the nation, Milwaukeeans enjoyed consuming the various beers produced in the city's breweries. As early as 1843, pioneer historian James Buck recorded 138 taverns in Milwaukee, an average of one per forty residents. Today, [[beer hall]]s and taverns are abundant in the city, but only one of the major breweries—[[Miller Brewing Company|Miller]]—remains in Milwaukee.<ref name="milwaukeehistory.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.milwaukeehistory.net/milwaukee_timeline/1800s.html|title=Milwaukee County Historical Society – Milwaukee Timeline 1800s|publisher=Milwaukeehistory.net|access-date=July 2, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610215529/http://www.milwaukeehistory.net/milwaukee_timeline/1800s.html|archive-date=June 10, 2010}}</ref>

In addition to Miller and the heavily automated [[Leinenkugel's]] brewery in the old Blatz 10th Street plant, other stand-alone breweries in Milwaukee include [[Milwaukee Ale House|Milwaukee Brewing Company]], a microbrewery in [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee#Walker's Point|Walker's Point neighborhood]]; [[Lakefront Brewery]], a [[microbrewery]] in Brewers Hill; and [[Sprecher Brewery]], a German brewery that also brews craft sodas.

===Music===
[[File:Jazz in the park Milwaukee 6062.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of "Jazz in the Park", [[Parks of Milwaukee|Cathedral Square Park]]]]

Milwaukee has a long history of musical activity. The first organized musical society, called "Milwaukee Beethoven Society" formed in 1843, three years before the city was incorporated.<ref>{{cite book|last=Buck|first=James S|year=1890|title=Pioneer History of Milwaukee|url=https://archive.org/details/pioneerhistoryof03inbuck|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|publisher=Swain}}</ref>

The large concentrations of German and other European immigrants contributed to the musical character of the city. [[Saengerfest]]e were held regularly.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1886/07/21/109786575.pdf "National Saengerfest; Great crowds assembling at Milwaukee for the Festival".] ''[[New York Times]]'' July 21, 1886.</ref>

In the early 20th century, guitarist [[Les Paul]] and pianist [[Liberace]] were some of the area's most famous musicians. Both Paul, born in Waukesha, and Liberace, born in West Allis, launched their careers in Milwaukee music venues. [[Paramount Records]], primarily a jazz and blues record label, was founded in [[Grafton, Wisconsin|Grafton]], a northern suburb of Milwaukee, in the 1920s and 1930s. [[Hal Leonard Corporation]], founded in 1947, is one of the world's largest music print publishers, and is headquartered in Milwaukee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.halleonard.com/aboutUs.jsp|title=Halleonard.com|publisher=Halleonard.com|access-date=September 10, 2012}}</ref> More recently, Milwaukee has a history of [[Rock music|rock]], [[hip hop]], [[jazz]], [[soul music|soul]], [[blues]], [[punk rock|punk]], [[ska]], [[industrial music]], [[electronica]], [[world music]], and [[pop music]] bands.

Milwaukee's most famous music venue is [[Summerfest]]. Founded in 1968, Summerfest features 700–800 live musical acts across 12 stages during 11 days over a 12-day period beginning in late June; while the dates adjust each year, Summerfest always includes July 4. On the Summerfest grounds, the largest venue is the American Family Insurance Amphitheater with a 23,000 person capacity. Adjacent is the BMO Harris Pavilion, which has a capacity of roughly 10,000. The BMO Harris Pavilion also hosts numerous concerts and events outside of Summerfest; other stages are also used during the numerous other festivals held on the grounds.

The city is represented in two of the four [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]]–the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] of [[Major League Baseball]] and the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] of the [[National Basketball Association]]. Milwaukee does not have a [[National Football League]] team or a [[National Hockey League]] team. For a short time, Milwaukee was home to the NFL's [[Milwaukee Badgers|Badgers]], from 1922 to 1926.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Government of Milwaukee}}
{{see also|List of mayors of Milwaukee}}

Milwaukee has a [[mayor-council]] form of government. With the election of Mayor [[John O. Norquist]] in 1988, the city adopted a cabinet form of government with the mayor appointing department heads not otherwise elected or appointed—notably the Fire and Police Chiefs. While this gave the mayor greater control of the city's day-to-day operations, the Common Council retains almost complete control over the city's finances and the mayor, with the exception of his proposed annual budget, cannot directly introduce legislation. The Common Council consists of 15 members, one from each district in the city.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}

===Primary and secondary education===

{{Main|Milwaukee Public Schools}}

[[Milwaukee Public Schools]] (MPS) is the largest school district in Wisconsin and [[List of the largest school districts in the United States by enrollment|thirty-third]] in the nation. As of 2007, it had an enrollment of 89,912 students<ref>{{cite news|last=Borsuk|first=Alan J.|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=674879|title=The face of Milwaukee Public Schools is changing|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=October 16, 2007|access-date=July 2, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212060823/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=674879|archive-date=February 12, 2008}}</ref> and as of 2006 employed 11,100 full-time and substitute teachers in 323 schools. Milwaukee Public Schools operate as [[magnet school]]s, with individualized specialty areas for interests in academics or the arts. [[Washington High School (Milwaukee)|Washington High School]], [[Riverside University High School]], [[Rufus King High School]], [[Ronald Wilson Reagan College Preparatory High School]], [[Samuel Morse Middle School for the Gifted and Talented]], [[Golda Meir School]], [[Milwaukee High School of the Arts]], and [[Lynde & Harry Bradley Technology and Trade School]] are some of the magnet schools in Milwaukee. In 2007, 17 MPS high schools appeared on a national list of "dropout factories"—schools where fewer than 60% of freshmen graduate on time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/31977494.html|title=Local 'drop-out factories'|last=Borsuk|first=Alan J.|date=October 30, 2007|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|access-date=March 27, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208112018/http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/31977494.html|archive-date=December 8, 2010}}</ref>

Milwaukee is also home to over two dozen private or parochial high schools, such as [[Marquette University High School]], and many private and [[parochial school|parochial]] middle and elementary schools. In 1990, Milwaukee became the first city in the United States to offer a [[school voucher]] program.

Of persons in Milwaukee aged 25 and above, 89.2% have a high school diploma, and 32.4% have a bachelor's degree or higher.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/milwaukeecountywisconsin/EDU635216#viewtop|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|website=Census Bureau QuickFacts|access-date=January 11, 2023}}</ref>

The ''[[UWM Post]]'' is the independent, student-run weekly at the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]].{{citation needed|date=May 2023}}

Milwaukee's major [[network television]] affiliates are [[WTMJ-TV|WTMJ]] 4 ([[NBC]]), [[WITI-TV|WITI]] 6 ([[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]), [[WISN-TV|WISN]] 12 ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]), [[WVTV]] 18 ([[The CW|CW]]), [[WCGV-TV]] 24 ([[MyNetworkTV]]), and [[WDJT]] 58 ([[CBS]]).

Until 2015, [[Journal Communications]] (a [[NYSE]]-traded corporation) published the ''Journal Sentinel'' and well over a dozen local weekly newspapers in the metropolitan area. At that time, Journal was split into the Journal Media Group for publishing, while the television and radio stations went to the [[E. W.

===Transportation===

====Airports====
[[File:Timmerman Field (MWC).JPG|thumb|Timmerman Field|alt=]]

Milwaukee has two airports: [[Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport]] (KMKE) on the southern edge of the city, which handles the region's commercial traffic, and [[Lawrence J. Timmerman Airport]] (KMWC), known locally as Timmerman Field, on the northwest side along Appleton Avenue.

Mitchell is served by twelve airlines,<ref name="mitchellairport.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.mitchellairport.com/airline-information/|title=Mitchell Airport – Airline Information|publisher=mitchellairport.com|access-date=November 1, 2017}}</ref> which offer roughly 240 daily departures and 245 daily arrivals.

====Intercity rail and bus====
[[File:Milwaukee Intermodal Station.jpg|thumb|Milwaukee Intermodal Station|alt=]]

Milwaukee's [[Amtrak]] station was renovated in 2007 to create [[Milwaukee Intermodal Station]] near downtown Milwaukee and the Third Ward to provide Amtrak riders easy access to intercity bus services. The station itself replaces the previous main railway station, [[Everett Street Depot]]. Milwaukee is served by Amtrak's ''[[Hiawatha (Amtrak train)|Hiawatha]]'' passenger train up to seven times daily between Milwaukee Intermodal Station and [[Chicago Union Station]], including a stop at the [[Milwaukee Airport Railroad Station]], [[Sturtevant station|Sturtevant, Wisconsin]], and [[Glenview station|Glenview, Illinois]]. Amtrak's ''[[Empire Builder]]'' stops at Milwaukee Intermodal Station and connects to [[Chicago]] and the [[Pacific Northwest]], with several stops along the way.

==== Past transit proposals ====

* '''Commuter rail''': Milwaukee currently has no commuter rail system. [[Proposed Kenosha–Racine–Milwaukee regional rail service|Previous efforts to develop one]] proposed a 0.5% sales tax{{Citation needed|date=November 2023}} in [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], [[Racine County, Wisconsin|Racine]] and [[Kenosha County, Wisconsin|Kenosha]] counties to fund an expansion of [[Metra]]'s [[Union Pacific / North Line]] from [[Kenosha]] to Milwaukee Intermodal Station. However, Wisconsin repealed the legislation authorizing such efforts in June 2011, and the project is now defunct.<ref>{{cite web|date=October 5, 2009|title=KRMonline – Home|url=http://maps.sewrpc.org/KRMonline/|access-date=May 12, 2012|publisher=Maps.sewrpc.org|archive-date=October 13, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231013021052/http://maps.sewrpc.org/KRMonline/|url-status=dead}}</ref>
* '''Light rail:''' A 1990s Wisconsin DOT plan determined the path forward for east-west transportation in Milwaukee to be a mix of a comprehensive light rail system, an expansion of I-94 with [[HOV lanes]], and increased bus service to Waukesha County. Despite being awarded $289 million for this plan from the federal government, local Republican leaders rescinded support for light rail. The "locally preferred alternative" would have connected destinations including downtown Milwaukee, UW-Milwaukee, and the Milwaukee Regional Medical Center.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The railroad not taken|url=https://archive.jsonline.com/news/opinion/32538794.html|access-date=January 29, 2024|website=archive.jsonline.com}}</ref>

[[File:ISS045-E-110180 reversed from original Milwaukee at night.jpg|thumb|Milwaukee seen from the [[International Space Station]] in 2015]]

Three of Wisconsin's [[Interstate highway]]s intersect in Milwaukee. [[Interstate 94 in Wisconsin|Interstate 94]] (I-94) comes north from Chicago to enter Milwaukee and continues west to [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]]. The stretch of I-94 from Seven Mile Road to the [[Marquette Interchange]] in Downtown Milwaukee is known as the North-South Freeway. I-94 from downtown Milwaukee west to Wisconsin 16 is known as the East-West Freeway.

[[I-43]] enters Milwaukee from [[Beloit, Wisconsin|Beloit]] in the southwest and continues north along Lake Michigan to [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] via [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]] and [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin|Manitowoc]]. I-43 southwest of I-41/I-894/US 41/US 45 [[Hale Interchange]] is known as the Rock Freeway. I-43 is cosigned with I-894 East and I-41/US 41 South to I-94 is known as the Airport Freeway. At I-94, I-43 follows I-94 to the Marquette Interchange. I-43 continues north known as the North-South Freeway to Wisconsin Highway 57 near Port Washington.

Approved in 2015, [[Interstate 41]] follows I-94 north from the state line before turning west at the [[Mitchell Interchange]] to the Hale Interchange and then north to Green Bay via [[Fond du Lac, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac]], [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin|Oshkosh]] and [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]]. I-41/US 41/US 45 from the Hale Interchange to Wisconsin Hwy 145 is known as the Zoo Freeway.

Milwaukee has two auxiliary Interstate Highways, [[I-894]] and [[I-794]]. I-894 bypasses downtown Milwaukee on the west and south sides of the city from the [[Zoo Interchange]] to the Mitchell Interchange. I-894 is part of the Zoo Freeway and the Airport Freeway. I-794 extends east from the Marquette Interchange to Lake Michigan before turning south over the [[Hoan Bridge]] toward Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport, turning into [[Wisconsin Highway 794|Highway 794]] along the way. This is known as the Lake Freeway.

Milwaukee is also served by three [[US Highways]]. [[U.S. Route 18 in Wisconsin|U.S. Highway 18]] (US&nbsp;18) provides a link from downtown to points west heading to [[Waukesha, Wisconsin|Waukesha]] along Wells Street, 17th/16th Streets, Highland Avenue, 35th Street, Wisconsin Avenue, and Blue Mound Road. [[U.S. Route 41 in Wisconsin|US&nbsp;41]] and [[U.S. Route 45 in Wisconsin|US&nbsp;45]] both provide north–south freeway transportation on the western side of the city. The freeway system in Milwaukee carries roughly 25% of all travel in Wisconsin.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wpr.org/report-nearly-1-200-wisconsin-bridges-deficient-condition|title=Report: Nearly 1,200 Wisconsin Bridges In 'Deficient' Condition|date=February 2, 2018|work=Wisconsin Public Radio|access-date=February 5, 2018|language=en}}</ref>
