== History ==
[[File:Qila sheikhupura01.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Sheikhupura Fort]] was established in 1607.]]

=== Mughal ===
Mughal Emperor [[Jahangir]] laid the foundations of Sheikhupura in 1607 near the older town of [[Jandiala Sher Khan]], an important provincial town during the early to middle Mughal era.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orientalarchitecture.com/sid/1132/pakistan/sheikhupura/jandiala-baoli-and-mosque|title=Asian Historical Architecture: A Photographic Survey|last=orientalarchitecture.com|website=www.orientalarchitecture.com|access-date=2018-01-21}}</ref> He also erected the nearby [[Hiran Minar]], Sheikhpura's most renowned site, between 1607 and 1620 as a monument to his beloved pet deer, ''Mansiraj'', at a time when the area served as a royal hunting ground for the Mughal Emperor.<ref name="Ruggles">{{cite book|title=Islamic Gardens and Landscapes|last1=Ruggles|first1=D.

=== British ===
During [[British Raj|British colonial rule]], the area was under the rule of [[Raja Dhayan Singh]]<ref>{{Cite book |last=Smiles |first=Samuel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y40MAAAAYAAJ&dq=gaur+brahmin+army&pg=RA3-PA11 |title=Personalities: A Comprehensive and Authentic Biographical Dictionary of Men |year= 1950 |publisher= Arunum & Sheel |isbn=978-93-5704-660-2 |page=11}}</ref> and during establishment of [[British Raj|British colonial rule]], Bhatti possessions that had been seized by the Sikhs were restored.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://uu.urbanunit.gov.pk/Documents/Publications/0/115.pdf|title=Sheikupura City Profile|website=Urban Unit|publisher=Government of Pakistan}}</ref> The large area between the [[Chenab River|Chenab]] and [[Ravi River|Ravi]] rivers were initially consolidated into a single district with Sheikhupura serving as its first headquarters, until 1851.<ref name=":0" /> The area around Sheikhupura attained District status in 1919,<ref name=":0" /> with M.M.L.

=== Partition ===
On the eve of the [[Partition of British India]], Sikhs made up 19% of the district's population. Despite the area's Muslim majority, Sikhs had hoped that the boundary commission would award the area to India, given the proximity of Sheikhupura to the city of [[Nankana Sahib]] - revered as the birthplace of the founder of [[Sikhism]], [[Guru Nanak]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yNN4SE7cL60C&q=sheikhupura+sikh&pg=PA49|title=Borders & Boundaries: Women in India's Partition|last1=Menon|first1=Ritu|last2=Bhasin|first2=Kamla|date=1998|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813525525|language=en}}</ref> The city was spared the large-scale rioting that engulfed [[Lahore]] earlier in 1947, and the city's Sikh population did not shift to India before the [[Radcliffe Line]] that demarcated the border of the newly independent states of [[Pakistan]] and [[India]] was announced.<ref name=":2" />

The Sikh population had not made arrangements to leave and remained trapped in the city until 31 August 1947.<ref name=":2" /> The city's [[Sacha Sauda]] refugee camp hosted upwards of 100,000 Sikh refugees who had come to the city after fleeing nearby [[Gujranwala]] and other surrounding areas earlier that year.<ref name=":2" /> Fierce violence erupted in the city, and an estimated 10,000 people were killed in Sheikhupura between 16 August and 31 August in communal rioting between [[Sikhs]] and [[Muslims]].<ref name=":2" />
