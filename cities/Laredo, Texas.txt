'''Laredo''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|r|eɪ|d|oʊ}} {{respell|lə|RAY|doh}}; {{IPA|es|laˈɾeðo|lang}}) is a city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]] and [[county seat|seat]] of [[Webb County, Texas|Webb County]], on the north bank of the [[Rio Grande]] in [[South Texas]], across from [[Nuevo Laredo]], [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]. Founded in 1755, Laredo grew from a village to the capital of the short-lived [[Republic of the Rio Grande]] to the largest inland port on the [[Mexico–United States border|Mexican border]]. Laredo's economy is primarily based on international trade with Mexico, and as a major hub for three areas of transportation: land, rail, and air cargo. The city is on the southern end of [[Interstate 35|I-35]], which connects manufacturers in northern Mexico through Interstate 35 as a major route for trade throughout the U.S. It has [[International bridges in Laredo, Texas|four international bridges and one railway bridge]].

According to the [[2020 United States Census|2020 census]], the city's population was 255,205, making it the [[List of cities in Texas by population|11th-most populous]] city in Texas and third-most populated U.S. city on the Mexican border, after [[San Diego|San Diego, California]], and [[El Paso, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/laredocitytexas/PST045222|title=QuickFacts: Laredo city, Texas|website=Census.gov|publisher=United States Census Bureau|access-date=January 7, 2023}}</ref> Its [[Laredo metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] is the [[List of United States metropolitan areas|178th-largest in the

The Spanish colonial settlement of Villa de San Agustin de Laredo was founded in 1755 by [[Tomás Sánchez (captain)|Don Tomás Sánchez Barrera]], while the area was part of the [[Nuevo Santander]] region in the Spanish viceroyalty of [[New Spain]]. Villa de San Agustin de Laredo was named after [[Laredo, Cantabria]], Spain and in honor of Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]]. In 1840, Laredo was the capital of the independent [[Republic of the Rio Grande]], set up in opposition to [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]]; it was brought back into Mexico by military force.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

In 1846 during the [[Mexican–American War]], the town was occupied by the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]]. After the war, the [[Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo]] ceded the land to the United States. A referendum was taken in the town, which voted to petition the American military government in charge of the area to return the town to Mexico. When this petition was rejected, many who had been in the area for generations, moved across the river into Mexican territory, where they founded [[Nuevo Laredo]]. Many others, especially original land grantees on the north side of the Rio Grande remained, becoming Texans in the process. In 1849, the United States Army set up [[Fort McIntosh (Texas)|Fort McIntosh]] (originally Camp Crawford). Laredo was rechartered as a city in 1852.

Laredo is one of the oldest [[border crossing|crossing]] points along the Mexico–United States border, and the nation's largest inland port of entry. In 2005, Laredo celebrated the 250th anniversary of its founding.

The etymology of the name for the Spanish town of Laredo is unclear. Some scholars say the name stems from ''[[glaretum]]'', which means "sandy, rocky place". Others state Laredo stems from a [[Basque language|Basque]] word meaning "beautiful pastures".<ref>[http://nuevolaredo.usconsulate.gov/nuevolaredo/Nuevo_Laredo_History.html Laredo Origin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803193151/http://nuevolaredo.usconsulate.gov/nuevolaredo/Nuevo_Laredo_History.html |date=August 3, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_tamaulipas|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517163702/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_tamaulipas|url-status=dead|title=Laredo Origin|archive-date=May 17, 2011}}</ref> Laredo might also stem from the [[Latin]] ''[[Laridae|larida]]'', which means [[gull]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.lmtonline.com/local/article/Operator-needed-for-historic-Plaza-Theater-after-13184906.php|title=Operator needed for historic Plaza Theater after unanimous vote by the Laredo City Council|author=Julia Wallace|newspaper=Laredo Morning Times|date=August 27, 2018|access-date=August 30, 2018}}</ref>

Laredo is the largest inland port in the United States, and [[Nuevo Laredo]] the largest in Latin America.

===Labor market information===

As of October 2007, Laredo's labor market was in the following industries by percentage of number employed: Trade, Transportation, and Utilities (32%), Information (1%), Financial Activity (5%), Professional and Business Services (6%), Education and Health Services (15%), Leisure and Hospitality (10%), Government (23%), Mining and Construction (5%), Manufacturing (2%), and Other Services (2%).

Laredo has increased the number of nonagricultural jobs from 55,100 in January 1996 to 86,600 in October 2007. Laredo has had a higher job growth rate (2%–6.5%) than the state as a whole because of expanded international trade through NAFTA. In 2007, Laredo experienced a job growth rate of 2.5% with the unemployment rate as of October 2007, standing at  4.1% or 3,700 unemployed persons, as compared to 3.9% in Texas statewide. This is a significant drop since the mid-1990s, when Laredo's unemployment was over 15%.

Laredo has had positive job market growth since the mid-1990s; setbacks in the mining (oil/gas) industry shifted a few thousand workers to other industries such as international trade and construction. Many large employers in the oil and gas industries shut down operations in Laredo and across Texas, and shifted to foreign countries. The same effect occurred in the garment industry (Levis and Haggar) along the Texas border area. Laredo lost its only garment-producing company (Barry), costing the jobs of about 300 workers. Laredo's strong job growth rate in retail and transportation services limited the adverse effects of long-term unemployment from the few massive layoffs of the late 1990s. Laredo's success with international trade is also a vulnerability; it depends on changes to Mexico's economy, that status of immigration laws (along with daily border crossings: shoppers and commercial trade), and terrorism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.southtexasworkforce.org/labor-market-information|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628201836/http://www.southtexasworkforce.org/labor-market-information|url-status=dead|title=Laredo Labor Market, South Texas Workforce Commission|archive-date=June 28, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Texas Metro Market Overview: Laredo: Labor page 14|url=http://recenter.tamu.edu/mreports/2011/Laredo.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203144126/http://recenter.tamu.edu/mreports/2011/Laredo.pdf|archive-date=February 3, 2015|access-date=August 27, 2017|website=Recenter.tamu.edu}}</ref>

Most of Laredo's architecture is of [[Spanish architecture|Spanish Colonial]], [[Architecture of the United States|American]], and Mexican flavor. Most of Laredo's Spanish Colonial-style buildings are in downtown Laredo. More modern American architecture can be seen along Interstate Highway 35, as well as in the downtown area<ref>{{cite web |last=ROBINSON |first=WILLARD B. |title=CHURCH ARCHITECTURE |date=June 12, 2010 |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/cgc02 |website=Tshaonline.org|access-date=August 27, 2017}}</ref>

On October 28, 1958, in the episode "The Ghost" of the ABC/WB Western series, ''[[Sugarfoot]]'', "The Streets of Laredo" is performed by child actor [[Tommy Rettig]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/Western/Sugarfoot_02_(1958-59).htm|title=The Ghost|publisher=Classic Television Archives|access-date=December 11, 2013}}</ref> Another song is [[Laredo Tornado]] from the British rock band [[ELO]].

The first song on Marty Robbins' 1966 LP ''The Drifter'' was "Meet Me Tonight in Laredo".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Marty-Robbins-The-Drifter/release/3462152|title=Marty Robbins - The Drifter|website=Discogs}}</ref>

Laredo is home to [[Laredo College]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laredo.edu/cms/index_400.aspx|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120805054924/http://www.laredo.edu/cms/index_400.aspx|url-status=dead|title=Laredo Community College |website=www.laredo.edu|archive-date=August 5, 2012}}</ref> and [[Texas A&M International University]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tamiu.edu|title=TAMIU Home|first=Rory|last=King|website=Tamiu.edu|access-date=August 27, 2017}}</ref> (TAMIU).

Laredo College is a two-campus institution which offers two-year [[Associate Degree|Associate's]] degrees. The main campus is at the western end of downtown Laredo near the [[Rio Grande]], on the site of the former Fort McIntosh. This fort played a major role in the development of Laredo, as it protected the community from Indian raids in its early history. Several of the old buildings at the fort were converted into classrooms, but after renovation programs nearly all of the campus structures are now modern. The smaller, newer second campus, [[Laredo College South Campus]], is in south Laredo along [[U. S. Route 83]].

===Television===
According to [[Nielsen Media Research]], the Laredo region (which includes [[Webb County, Texas|Webb]] and [[Zapata County, Texas|Zapata]] counties) is ranked 185th market by population size in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nielsen.com/content/dam/corporate/us/en/public%20factsheets/tv/nielsen-2012-local-DMA-TV-penetration.pdf|title=Nielson: Local Television Market Universe Estimates|website=Nielsen.com|access-date=August 27, 2017}}</ref> The first station to broadcast in Laredo was [[KGNS-TV|KGNS]] in 1956, followed by [[KVTV]] in 1973, then KJTB (now [[KLDO-TV|KLDO]]) in 1985.

The only notable television network missing from Laredo's airwaves is [[PBS]] or [[Cozi TV]]. Laredo had a full-power local [[The CW]] affiliate, KGNS-DT2, but on July 3, 2014, the affiliation switched to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Prior to that KJTB channel 27, from January 1985 to October 1988 was Laredo's ABC affiliate. KJTB was later bought by [[Entravision]] and affiliated the station to [[Telemundo]] and changed its callsign to [[KLDO-TV|KLDO]]. Today KLDO is affiliated to [[Univision]]. Before KJTB, [[KGNS-TV|KGNS]], an [[NBC]] affiliate had a secondary affiliation to ABC from its founding in 1956 through KJTB's founding in 1985. On November 6, 2013, KGNS reached an agreement to add the ABC affiliation. The ABC affiliate launched in July 2014 when KGNS dropped The CW programming and added ABC programming.<ref>[http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/71776/gray-to-air-abc-on-kgns-subchannel Gray to Air ABC on KGNS Subchannel] ''TVNewsCheck'', November 6, 2013.</ref> In October 2015 KVTV now [[KYLX-LD|KYLX]] started broadcasting The CW Programming on its digital subchannel 13.2.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gray-expands-its-partnership-with-the-cw-network-300193285.html |title=Gray Expands Its Partnership with The CW Network |publisher=Gray Television, Inc. |website=www.prnewswire.com |access-date=April 18, 2018}}</ref>

In December 2014, all Nuevo Laredo stations turned off [[analog television]] broadcasting and started broadcasting [[Digital television|digitally]] only.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tdt.mx/tdt/cuando-me-toca/?localidad=NUEVO+LAREDO%2C+NUEVO+LAREDO%2C+TAMAULIPAS&id-localidad=246454&x=6&y=16 |title=¿Cuándo me toca? &#124; Televisión Digital Terrestre |access-date=November 14, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314003732/http://www.tdt.mx/tdt/cuando-me-toca/?localidad=NUEVO+LAREDO%2C+NUEVO+LAREDO%2C+TAMAULIPAS&id-localidad=246454&x=6&y=16 |archive-date=March 14, 2014 }}</ref>

The health center's main building is {{convert|64000|sqft|m2|-2}}. The Medical center moved to its new $11,000,000 building in 2006. The main Gateway Community Health Center is in East Laredo, close to [[U.S. Highway 59 (Texas)|U.S. Highway 59]]. It also has three branches in the Laredo area: the South Clinic, El Cenizo Community Center, and Quad City Community Center.

Gateway Community Health Center services include:

The Laredo Specialty Hospital<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lsh.ernesthealth.com/|title=LSH – We are passionate, patient caregivers.|website=lsh.ernesthealth.com|access-date=August 27, 2017}}</ref> is the fourth-largest medical center in Laredo. It is owned by [[Ernest Health Inc.]] and was founded by Elmo Lopez Jr. on May 22, 2006. It admitted its first patient within hours of operation. The grand opening took place in March 2007.

===Transportation===
In 2016, 82.3 percent of working Laredo residents commuted by driving alone, 10.2 percent carpooled, 0.9 percent used public transportation, and 1.9 percent walked. About 2 percent of working Laredo residents commuted by all other means, including taxi, bicycle, and motorcycles. About 2.6 percent worked at home.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Census Reporter|title=Means of Transportation to Work by Age|access-date=May 6, 2018|url=https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B08101&geo_ids=16000US4841464&primary_geo_id=16000US4841464}}</ref>

====Air====
[[File:KLRD Terminal.jpg|thumb|Laredo International Airport]]
[[File:Railway Bridge.jpg|thumb|Tex-Mex Railway International Bridge view from Laredo]]
Laredo is served by the [[Laredo International Airport]]. Daily flights are available to Houston ([[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]]) and to [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]]. Tri-weekly flights to [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] are available. After Laredo Air Force Base closed in the mid-1970s, the federal government handed over the old air force base and property to the City of Laredo for a new municipal airport. From the mid-1970s until the mid-1990s, the airport used a small terminal for passenger airline service and several old hangars for air cargo and private aircraft. A new state-of-the art passenger terminal was built along the then newly constructed Loop 20 to accommodate larger jets and to increase passenger air travel through Laredo. Expansion of air cargo facilities, taxiways and aprons, air cargo carriers such as DHL, FedEx, UPS, BAX, and others have responded by adding commercial air cargo jet services. Laredo also has two medical [[helipad]]s, at Laredo Medical Center and Doctor's Hospital.

====Mass transit====
[[El Metro Transit|El Metro]] is the public transit system that operates in the city with 21 fixed routes and Paratransit services, with approximately 4.6&nbsp;million passengers per year. El Metro works with a fleet of over 47 fixed route buses, 2 trolleys and 18 Paratransit/El Lift vans. The El Metro hub is in downtown Laredo at El Metro Transit Center. The center also houses [[Greyhound Lines]] and provides fee-based daily parking for downtown shoppers and workers.

====Rural transit====
Rural transportation is provided by the [[Webb County]] operated "El Aguila Rural Transportation" (the Eagle) bus services. El Aguila serves fixed daily routes from rural communities ([[Bruni, Texas|Bruni]], [[El Cenizo, Texas|El Cenizo]], [[Mirando City, Texas|Mirando City]], [[Oilton, Texas|Oilton]], and [[Rio Bravo, Texas|Rio Bravo]]) to the downtown El Metro Transit Center.
