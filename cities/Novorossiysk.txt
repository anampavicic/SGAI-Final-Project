==History==
In antiquity, the shores of the [[Tsemes Bay]] were the site of '''Bata''' ({{langx|grc|Βατά}}), an ancient Greek colony that specialized in the [[grain trade]]. It is mentioned in the works of [[Strabo]]<ref>11.2.14 http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-grc1:11.2.14</ref> and [[Ptolemy]], among others.

Following brief periods of Roman and Khazar control, from the 9th century onwards, the area was part of the Byzantine θέμα Χερσῶνος [[Cherson (theme)|''Thema Khersonos'']] (Province of Cherson).

During the 11th century, the area was overrun and controlled by nomads from the Eurasian steppe, led by the [[Cumans]]. Later that century, the Byzantine emperor Ἀλέξιος Κομνηνός [[Alexios I Komnenos]] ([[reign|r.]] 1081–1118) was approached by [[Anglo-Saxon]] refugees, who had left England following the [[Norman conquest]]. Alexios offered land to these refugees in ''Thema Khersonos'' if they could recapture it from the nomads and there is contemporaneous evidence that a [[New England (medieval)|Byzantine-English colony]] was subsequently founded. For example, [[portolan|medieval nautical chart]]s mention place names on the Kuban coast with possible English origins, including a port (located within or near the future site of Novorossiysk) known as '''Susaco''' (or ''Susacho'') – a name that may have been derived from [[Sussex]].<ref name="CG-NE">{{cite web|url=http://www.caitlingreen.org/2015/05/|title=The medieval 'New England': a forgotten Anglo-Saxon colony on the north-eastern Black Sea coast|first=Caitlin|last=Green|date=May 19, 2015|access-date=February 25, 2018}}</ref> (The same maps also show, north-west of ''Susaco'', a river ''Londia'', which may derive its name from [[London]].<ref name="CG-NE"/>)

In the 15th century, [[Genoa|Genoese]] merchants from the [[Ghisolfi]] family maintained a trade outpost in the area. A 2007 archaeological investigation of related sites discovered some interesting items.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nvis.ru/adm/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=10|title=Официальный сайт администрации города-героя Новороссийска –  Content|date=May 25, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525003445/http://www.nvis.ru/adm/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=10|archive-date=May 25, 2007}}</ref>

From 1722, the bay was controlled by an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] fortress (''qale'') named '''Sujuk''' (also transliterated ''Sudzhuk'', ''Sudschuk'' and ''Soğucak''). This name may be derived from ''Susaco'' (see above) and, as late as 1769, the area was sometimes named in European maps as ''Suzako''.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

The coastline was ceded to Russia in 1829 as a result of the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828-1829|Russo-Turkish War]]. After this, admirals [[Mikhail Lazarev]] and [[Nikolay Raevsky the Younger|Nikolay Raevsky]] founded an eastern base for the [[Black Sea Fleet]] on the shore in 1838. Named after the province of [[Novorossiya]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2018|reason=Dnipro, Ukraine, was named Novorossiysk and was capital of the second Novorossiya governorate. This city was founded 36 years after the governorate was abolished, and is not in its former territory.}} the port formed a vital link in the chain of forts known as the [[Black Sea Coastal Line]], which stretched south to [[Sochi]].

During the rest of the 19th century, Novorossiysk developed rapidly. It was granted city status in 1866 and became the capital of the [[Novorossiysk Okrug]] and [[Black Sea Governorate]], the smallest in the [[Russian Empire]], in 1896. In December 1905, the city was the seat of the short-lived [[Novorossiysk Republic]]. From August 26, 1918, until March 27, 1920, the city was used as the principal center of [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]]'s [[White movement|White Army]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]. Denikin's [[South Russian Government]] was moved to [[Crimea]] and many Whites escaped from Novorossiysk to [[Constantinople]] during the [[Evacuation of Novorossiysk (1920)]], with the help of [[Allies (World War I)|Allied]] warships.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Story: The evacuation of Novorossiysk {{!}} Lives of the First World War |url=https://livesofthefirstworldwar.iwm.org.uk/story/108530 |access-date=2024-06-23 |website=livesofthefirstworldwar.iwm.org.uk}}</ref>

During [[World War II]], most of the city was occupied by the German and Romanian Armies on September 10, 1942.<ref>Robert Forczyk, ''The Caucasus 1942–43: Kleist’s race for oil''</ref> A small unit of Soviet sailors defended one part of the city, known as [[Malaya Zemlya]], for 225 days beginning on February 4, 1943, and the town was liberated by the [[Red Army]] on September 16, 1943. The heroic defense of the port by the sailors allowed the Soviets to retain possession of the city's bay, which prevented the Axis from using the port for supply shipments. Novorossiysk was awarded the title [[Hero City (Soviet Union)|Hero City]] in 1973.

In 1960, the town was commemorated in [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]'s work [[Novorossiysk Chimes|''Novorossiysk Chimes, the Flame of Eternal Glory'']] (Opus 111b).

In 2003, [[President of Russia|President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] signed a [[Decree of the President of Russia|decree]] setting up a naval base for the Black Sea Fleet in Novorossiysk. Russia has allocated 12.3 billion [[ruble]]s (about $480 million) for the construction of the new base between 2007 and 2012. The construction of other facilities and infrastructure at the base, including units for coastal troops, aviation and logistics, will continue beyond 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rusnavy.com/news/navy/index.php?ELEMENT_ID=16492 |title = Novorossiysk Naval Base Construction: First Phase to Finish Late in 2013}}</ref> Russia planned to move the Black Sea Fleet with 80 warships and its headquarters from [[Sevastopol]] to Novorossiysk base in 2020.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Şafak|last1=Oğuz|url=https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/355595|title=Russian Hybrid Warfare and Its Implications in The Black Sea|journal=Bölgesel Araştırmalar Dergisi|date=May 1, 2017|volume=1|issue=1|page=11|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200711010100/https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/355595|archive-date=July 11, 2020|url-status=live|access-date=July 21, 2021}}</ref>

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is, together with twenty-four [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|rural localities]], incorporated as the '''[[City of federal subject significance|City]] of Novorossiysk'''—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Krasnodar Krai|districts]].<ref name="Ref1481">Reference Information #34.01-707/13-03</ref> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the City of Novorossiysk is incorporated as '''Novorossiysk Urban Okrug'''.<ref name="Ref752">Law #686-KZ</ref>

=== Coat of arms of Novorossiysk ===
The coat of arms of Novorossiysk was officially approved by Emperor Nicholas II on October 15, 1914. The description of the coat of arms was as follows: in a golden field above a black wavy tip, a black double-headed eagle under a crown, in the paws of an eagle a scepter and a power, on the chest a scarlet shield in which a golden Orthodox cross above a silver inverted crescent.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Герб Новороссийска |url=http://www.heraldicum.ru/russia/subjects/towns/novoross.htm |access-date=2024-07-19 |website=heraldicum.ru}}</ref> In 1994, the Soviet coat of arms was changed to a new one. In 2006, the coat of arms of 1914 was re-adopted with minor changes (a crown was added). The description of the modern coat of arms sounds like this in official sources: In a gold shield with a black wavy tip is a black double-headed eagle crowned with an Imperial crown, with a scepter and a power in its paws, on the wings of which is a shield, in the scarlet field of which is a golden Orthodox eight-pointed cross mounted on a silver inverted crescent. The shield is crowned with a golden five-pronged tower crown.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Администрация и Дума города Новороссийска |url=https://www.admnvrsk.ru/index.php/2009-11-08-08-49-48 |access-date=2024-07-19 |website=admnvrsk.ru}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Karte des Kaukasischen Isthmus - Entworfen und gezeichnet von J-Grassl - 1856.jpg|thumb|left|"A Map of The Caucasian Isthmus". Designed and drawn by J. Grassl, 1856.]]
The city is located on the [[Black Sea]]. It is not a resort town, but [[Anapa]] to the north and [[Gelendzhik]] to the south are. There are several urban settlements under the jurisdiction of Novorossiysk. The most famous is [[Abrau-Dyurso]], which consists of a townlet on the shore of [[Lake Abrau]] and a village on the coast of the Black Sea, connected by a winding mountain road.

The area of Novorossiysk is one of Russia's main wine-growing regions. The [[wineries]] of [[Abrau-Dyurso]], established by [[Tsar Alexander III]] in 1870, produce table and sparkling wines for domestic consumption.

===Climate===
Novorossiysk has a borderline [[humid subtropical]] (''Cfa'') and [[Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa'') in the [[Köppen climate classification]]. Since the driest month has {{Convert|36|mm|in|abbr=in}} and may or may not happen consistently in the summer, the city cannot be classified as solely humid subtropical or Mediterranean.
