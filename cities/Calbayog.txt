== History ==

=== Unraveling of Revolutionary Society, ''Katipunan'' ===
After the exile of Rizal in [[Dapitan]], the [[Katipunan]] was born in [[Binondo, Manila]]. Andres Bonifacio and his men moved heaven and earth to fight against the Spanish government then led by Gob. Heneral Polavieja. The [[katipunan]] expanded its membership from [[Luzon]] down to the [[Visayas]] Region, thereby increasing the number of Katipuneros in a span of one year. Sensing the secret plan of the Katipunan to overthrow the government, the Spanish authorities raided a Binondo printing press where subversive documents were found and confiscated. One of the documents seized was the list of members of the Katipunan. The name Benedicto Nijaga was one in the list, being the collector of revolutionary funds in the area. Upon learning of the arrests, Governor Polavieja ordered the arrest of all suspected members of the Katipunan. Nijaga was arrested together with twelve other katipuneros while campaigning for revolutionary funds. Shortly after they were jailed and reportedly tortured, a trial ensued, reminiscent of that of Rizal and other Filipino nationalists.<ref>{{Cite web|date=January 11, 2012|title=The 13 Martyrs of Bagumbayan were executed January 11, 1897|url=https://kahimyang.com/kauswagan/articles/871/today-in-philippine-history-january-11-1897-the-so-called-thirteen-martyrs-of-bagumbayan-were-executed|access-date=July 11, 2021|website=The Kahimyang Project|language=en}}</ref> The 13 men were convicted and sentenced to death. On January 11, 1897, the thirteen were taken to Bagumbayan field under heavy guard. Just before sunrise, the men were executed.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The 13 Martyrs of Bagumbayan|url=http://www.philippinemasonry.org/the-13-martyrs-of-bagumbayan.html|access-date=July 11, 2021|website=Philippine Center for Masonic Studies|language=en}}</ref>

===After Spain transferred power to USA===
Colegio-Seminario de San Vicente de Paul (now [[Christ the King College]] and [[St. Vincent de Paul Seminary]]) were established in 1905 and [[La Milagrosa Academy]] was established in 1910.

On April 10, 1910, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Calbayog]] was created by virtue of the [[Papal Bull]] of [[Pope Pius X]], comprising the islands of Samar and [[Leyte]]. Calbayog became the episcopal see of the diocese.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Diocese of Calbayog, Philippines|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/calb0.htm|access-date=July 12, 2021|website=GCatholic}}</ref>

====World War II and later====
In 1942, the Japanese Army occupied Calbayog city. In 1945 the city was finally liberated by the Philippine Commonwealth troops and the guerrillas who had continued the fight against the Japanese throughout [[World War II]]. It was only much later that other dioceses in the region were created.
 
Republic Act No. 328, otherwise known as the [[City charter|City Charter]] of Calbayog was signed into law on July 15, 1948, by then President [[Elpidio Quirino]]. The first set of city officials, incumbent municipal officials of the place, were sworn in on October 16, 1948. The city comprises the territorial jurisdiction of the former Municipalities of Calbayog, Oquendo and Tinambacan.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Republic Act No. 328|url=https://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1948/ra_328_1948.html|access-date=July 11, 2021|website=www.lawphil.net}}</ref>

===2008: Death of a Judge===
In January 2008 Roberto Navidad, a Regional Trial Court (RTC) judge was shot dead in Calbayog City outside a drug store at the corner of Gomez Street and Nijaga Boulevard. As of 2008, the crime was still unsolved.<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/visayas/view/20080116-112779/Calbayog-judge-murdered |title=Calbayog judge murdered |access-date=March 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20150318202338/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/visayas/view/20080116-112779/Calbayog-judge-murdered |archive-date=March 18, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was the 15th judge to be ambushed in the Philippines since July 20, 1999 (the 14th under the Arroyo government).

===2011 Onwards: Political Deaths===
On May 1, 2011, Calbayog's Mayor Reynaldo Uy was murdered by unknown gunmen. After his death, Vice-Mayor Ronaldo P. Aquino was sworn in as city mayor.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Samar lawmaker, 5 others accused of 2011 slay of Calbayog mayor|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/aika-delgado-reynaldo-uy-murder-complaint|access-date=July 11, 2021|website=Rappler|date=3 May 2016 |language=en}}</ref>

On March 8, 2021, approximately 10 years after the death of Mayor Uy, Mayor Ronaldo P. Aquino was ambushed and killed by members of the Samar Provincial Police while on his way to his son's birthday party. The van he was riding was pelted with multiple bullets from high-powered arms. Two of his personnel were also among the casualties of the ambush.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1404565/calbayog-mayor-ambushed-on-his-way-to-sons-birthday-party-dies-in-hospital|title=Calbayog mayor ambushed on his way to son’s birthday party dies in hospital|first=Joey A.|last=Gabieta|date=8 March 2021|website=INQUIRER.net|accessdate=25 April 2024}}</ref>
Vice Mayor Diego P.

On June 9, 2021, a senate investigation led by Senator Ronald "Bato" de la Rosa was conducted where the PNP, NBI and members of the Aquino family presented their testimonies and findings. Charges have been filed on the policemen. As of the 2022 election, Raymund "Monmon" Uy is now the city's mayor.<ref>[https://halalanresults.abs-cbn.com/local/samar/city-of-calbayog City of Calbayog] abs-cbn.com</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Ex-PNP Chiefs' probe on Calbayog City Mayor's killing|url=http://legacy.senate.gov.ph/photo_release/2021/0609_05.asp|access-date=July 11, 2021|website=legacy.senate.gov.ph}}</ref>

===Upgrade of city status===
In the last quarter of 2021, Samar 1st district congressman [[Edgar Mary Sarmiento]] proposed to convert the city of Calbayog from being a component city into an independent component city through the virtue of House Bill No. 10483.<ref>{{cite web|first=Edgar Mary S.|last=Sarmiento|url=https://hrep-website.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/legisdocs/basic_18/HB10483.pdf|title=House Bill No. 10483 - The bill seeks to convert the City of Calbayog, Samar from a component city to an independent component city|date=November 11, 2021|publisher=House of Representatives|website=amozonaws.com|access-date=June 3, 2022}}</ref>

Forty percent of the city's land area are plain and hilly terrains with elevation ranging from {{convert|5|to|20|m}} above sea level. The rest are rugged mountain ranges with elevations from {{convert|300|to|700|m}} above sea level. Flooding is minimized because of many rivers, brooks, streams and natural water conveyors that flow towards the sea.

=== Climate ===
Calbayog experiences a variety of wind types: [[Amihan]] (northeastwind), Timog (southwind), [[Monsoon|Habagat]] (southwestwind), Canaway (northwest wind), Cabunghan (east wind), Dumagsa (southeast wind) and Salatan (west wind).

Calbayog has well distributed [[rainfall]] throughout the year, except during the summer months of February through May, when most parts of the city are dry. The highest rainfall intensity recorded is {{convert|267|mm}} per hour. Heavy downpour is seldom experienced in the locality, therefore making Calbayog potentially appropriate for protective agricultural investment.
