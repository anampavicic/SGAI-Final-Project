==History==
The city history dates back to 1975 when a landing party arriving by [[helicopter]] disembarked on the ice of the [[Itu-Yakha River]] to start developing Kholmogorskoye oil field. In November 1976, the first party of railway builders arrived at the site of the future city and camped out by [[Lake Khanto]] with the task of creating a settlement. On October&nbsp;26, 1977, the settlement of Noyabrsk, which grew around the [[train station|railway station]] of Noyabrskaya, was officially registered.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} It was decided to choose the name of "Noyabrsk" instead of the other proposal, "Khanto", to perpetuate the memory of the first arrival in November 1976, as the Russian word for November is "{{lang|ru|ноябрь}}" (''noyabr''). The settlement was granted [[urban-type settlement|work settlement]] status on November&nbsp;12, 1979 and that of a town on April&nbsp;28, 1982.<ref name="Charter">''Charter of the Municipal Formation of the City of Noyabrsk'', adopted on January&nbsp;1, 2006</ref>

The town is divided into a smaller southern part, Noyabrsk-I, and a larger northern part, Noyabrsk-II, each having its own [[train station]]. which has caught novice travellers out in the past.

In the summer and during early autumn the forests and marshes attract many people for hiking, camping and gathering berries and mushrooms.

Two religious landmarks of the town are the [[Russian Orthodox]] ''[[Archangel Michael]] Church'', which stands on a hill surrounded by trees, and a mosque.

==Crime==
Noyabrsk was a very young and partially [[closed city|closed town]] during the Soviet era, with a predominantly professional working population, which provided some protection from external criminal influence. With its opening in the early 1990s and with oil and gas industry maintaining relatively high living standards in the economic turmoil of Post-Soviet Russia, illicit drug business became highly profitable, drawing criminal elements from other regions. The situation was compounded by the police and officials being [[political corruption|corrupted]] and ill-equipped to tackle the problem and by the general lack of occupations for the teenagers. The drug abuse situation in Noyabrsk was covered on national TV and in other media and finally official and citizen organisations arose to fight the problem.<ref name="Drug_01">[http://www.vsluh.ru/news/society/106195.html Teenage drug use goes down] - news report.</ref>

On March&nbsp;17, 2009, a criminal case against the mayor Nikolay Korobkov was sent to court. According to the prosecution, he transferred some municipal property to a private company when he didn't have the power to do so.<ref name=korobkovcase>{{cite news|first=Igor|last=Lesovskikh|title=Мэра Ноябрьска направили в суд |url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?docsid=1139747|publisher=[[Kommersant]]|date=March 18, 2009|access-date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>
