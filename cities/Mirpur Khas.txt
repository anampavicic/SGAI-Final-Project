=== Mirpur Khas State ===
[[Image:TheTalpurSons.jpg|thumb|''The Talpur Princes of Mirpurkhas'': Third from the left is Mir Ali Murad Talpur II, the great grandson of [[Mir Ali Murad Talpur]], the founder of Mirpur Khas.]]
[[Mir Sher Muhammad Talpur]] (1829-1843) succeeded Mir Ali Murad, and built a fort in the city when he declared the ruler of the state, and ran a [[court|kutchery]] from within the fort. Elaborate graves for the local rulers were built at [[Chitorri]], and feature a syncretic architectural style that combines elements of Islamic and [[Rajasthan]]i architecture.<ref>{{cite news|title=Royal palaces of Talpurs of Mirpurkhas|url=http://www.thesindhtimes.com/blogs/royal-palaces-of-talpurs-of-mirpurkhas/|access-date=20 December 2017|agency=Sindh Times|date=17 April 2015}}</ref>

Mirpur Khas remained the capital of the Talpur Mirs of Mirpurkhas until 1843, when Sindh was annexed to British India under the [[East India Company]] following the conquest of Sindh by [[Charles James Napier]] and defeat of [[Mir Sher Muhammad Talpur]] on 24 March 1843 at the [[Battle of Dubba|battleground of Dubbo]].<ref name="CITEREFGazetteer1">{{Cite book| url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V17_371.gif| title=Imperial Gazetteer of India| first=William Wilson, Sir| last=Hunter| volume=17| page=365| publisher=Clarendon Press (Oxford, 1908–1931)| access-date=25 May 2008}}</ref> His battle for the Sindh state earned him the moniker "Lion of Sindh."<ref>The kutchery in the fort now has a tablet embedded at the entrance reading, "The fort within which this building stands was residence of Mir Sher Muhammad Khan, the Lion of Sind."</ref>

=== British ===
Later Sindh was made part of the colonial Bombay Presidency and Mirpurkhas was a part of it. [[Umerkot]] was made the district's headquarters of town of Thar and Parkar district and Mirpur Khas was ignored until the advent of the [[Luni river|Luni]]-[[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] branch of the [[Jodhpur]]-[[Bikaner]] Railway,<ref name="CITEREFGazetteer1"/> a subsidiary of the [[History of rail transport in Pakistan|Scinde Railway]] to the town. The opening of the Jamrao Canal in 1900 made Mirpur Khas stand out of the rest of the towns in the district. It was constituted a municipality in 1901<ref name="CITEREFGazetteer1"/> and the district headquarters was shifted from Umerkot to Mirpurkhas in 1906.

At the turn of the twentieth century, the population of the town was 2,787 persons with a density of 82 persons per square mile, howev Hall rahy is famous Dailouge 

After the [[Partition of India|independence]] of Pakistan in 1947, because of its proximity with the Indian border, Mirpur Khas became the first city to welcome refugees to Pakistan. It served as a primary railway junction for the first trains to rail across the [[Rajasthan]] to the Sindh province. The [[Partition of British India]] resulted in the large-scale exodus of much of the city's Hindu population, though like much of Sindh, Mirpur Khas did not experience the widespread rioting that occurred in Punjab and Bengal.<ref name=kumar>{{cite journal|last1=Kumar|first1=Priya|title=Sindh, 1947 and Beyond|journal=South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies|volume=39|issue=4|date=2 December 2016|pages=773–789|doi=10.1080/00856401.2016.1244752|doi-access=free}}</ref> In all, less than 500 Hindu were killed in

Though Mirpurkhas has a small industrial park, no industry is functional there. There are four sugar mills, as well as some cotton ginning, and edible oil mills in the city.<ref name="MEC">{{cite book|title=DRAFT DISTRICT DEVELOPMENT PROFILE/PLANFOR DISTRICT MIRPURKHAS|date=1998|publisher=SINDH REGIONAL PLAN ORGANISATION}}</ref> The city's economy has been adversely effected by a poor law and order situation, with violent conflict between rival families.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pakistan - Mirpurkhas District|url=https://www.ecoi.net/file_upload/1997_1298448504_pak35293.pdf|website=MRT RESEARCH RESPONSE|publisher=Migration Review Tribunal|access-date=20 December 2017}}</ref>

[[File:Sindhri Mango.JPG|thumb|200px|Mirpur Khas is famous for Sindhri mango]]
The district's very fertile land produces wheat, onion, sugarcane, cotton, chillies, and mangoes.<ref name="hussain">{{cite journal|last1=Hussain|first1=Faisal|title=Some important medicinal plants associated with the vegetation in district Mirpurkhas, Sindh|journal=International Journal of Biology and Biotechnology|date=2012|volume=9|issue=4|url=https://www.academia.edu/2764635}}</ref> Irrigation and farming was revitalised after the Jamrao Canal was built in the 1900s. Afterwards, the city was able to produce and cycle crops to supply mainly grain, cotton products like fabrics, and sugar from the sugarcane cultivation. For a certain period in history, Mirpurkhas enjoyed being the best cotton producer in the country and much of the income of the town came from cotton farming in its heyday.

Nowadays, however, the area is much known its mango produce. The city claims to have 252 different varieties of [[mangoes]], of which the most famous variety is the Sindhri Amb, literally ''the mango from Sindh''.
