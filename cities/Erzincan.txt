==History==
[[Acilisene]], the ancient region that is now Erzincan, was the site of the [[Peace of Acilisene]] by which in AD 387 [[Armenia]] was divided into two vassal states, a smaller one dependent on the [[Byzantine Empire]] and a larger one dependent on [[Sassanid|Persia]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=riW0kKzat2sC&pg=PA22 |first=Ronald Grigor |last=Suny |title=The Making of the Georgian Nation |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-25320915-3 |page=22}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Heritage of Armenian Literature: From the Oral Tradition to the Golden Age|url=https://archive.org/details/heritageofarmeni00ajha |url-access=registration|year=2000|publisher=Wayne State University Press|location=Detroit|isbn=9780814328156|page=[https://archive.org/details/heritageofarmeni00ajha/page/378 378]|editor1=A.

The etymological origin of the word is disputed, but it is agreed that the city was once called Erez. For a while it was called [[Justinianopolis in Armenia|Justinianopolis]] in honour of [[Emperor Justinian]]. In more recent [[Greek language|Greek]] it has been called as Κελτζηνή (''Keltzene'') and Κελεζηνή (''Kelezene'').<ref name=Janin>Raymond Janin, ''v.

In the settlement of Erez, at a yet unidentified site, there was a pre-Christian shrine dedicated to the Armenian goddess [[Anahit]]. A text of [[Agathangelos]] reports that during the first year of his reign, King [[Trdat of Armenia]] went to Erez and visited Anahit's temple to offer sacrifice. He ordered [[Gregory the Illuminator]], who was secretly a Christian, to make an offering at its altar. When Gregory refused, he was taken captive and tortured, starting the events that would end with Trdat's conversion to Christianity some 14 years later.<ref>Vreg Nersessian, "Treasures From the Ark", 2001, p114-115</ref> After that conversion, during the Christianisation of Armenia, the temple at Erez was destroyed and its property and lands were given to Gregory. It later became known for its extensive monasteries.

It is hard to tell when Acilisene became a [[bishopric]]. The first whose name is known is of the mid-5th century: Ioannes, who in 459 signed the decree of [[Patriarch Gennadius I of Constantinople]] against the [[simony|simoniacs]]. Georgius or Gregorius (both forms are found) was one of the Fathers of the [[Second Council of Constantinople]] (553), appearing as "bishop of Justinianopolis". Theodorus was at the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] in 681, signing as "bishop of Justinianopolis or the region of Ecclenzine". Georgius was at the [[Photius|Photian]] [[Council of Constantinople (879)]]. Until the 10th century, the diocese itself appears in none of the ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]''. At the end of that century, they present it as an autocephalous archdiocese, and those of the 11th century present it as a [[metropolitan see]] with 21 [[suffragan]]s. This was the time of greatest splendour of Acilisene, which ended with the decisive defeat of the [[Byzantine]]s by the [[Seljuk Turks]] at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071. After the 13th century, there is no mention of diocesan bishops of Acilisene and the see no longer appears in ''Notitiae Episcopatuum''.<ref name=Janin/><ref>Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0agp0mJFG_sC christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. I, coll. 435–436</ref> No longer a residential bishopric, Acilisene is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 823</ref>

In 1071 Erzincan was absorbed into the [[Mengucek|Mengüçoğlu]] under the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] Sulëiman [[Kutalmish]]. [[Marco Polo]], who wrote about his visit to Erzincan, said that the "people of the country are Armenians" and that Erzincan was the "noblest of cities" which contained the see of an archbishop.<ref name=":2">{{cite book|last1=Polo|first1=Marco|editor1-last=Yule|editor1-first=Sir Henry|editor2-last=Cordier|editor2-first=Henri|title=The Travels of Marco Polo|date=1993|publisher=Courier Corporation|location=New York|isbn=0486275868|page=45|edition=[Repr. of the 3. ed.,] London 1903.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RhE5ZUcZ_Q4C|chapter=Description of the Greater Hermenia}}</ref> In 1243 it was destroyed in fighting between the Seljuks under [[Kaykhusraw II]] and the [[Mongol]]s. However, by 1254 its population had recovered enough that [[William of Rubruck]] was able to say an earthquake had killed more than 10,000 people. During this period, the city reached a level of semi-independence under the rule of Armenian princes.<ref>{{in lang|hy}} Baghdasaryan, Ye. M.

Erzincan was one of the most pivotal towns in [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] history. It was there, in the summer of 1500, that about 7,000 [[Qizilbash]] forces, consisting of the Ustaclu, [[Shamlu]], Rumlu, Tekelu, Zhulkadir, [[Afshar tribe|Afshar]], [[Qajars (tribe)|Qajar]] and Varsak tribes, responded to the invitation of [[Ismail I]],<ref>Faruk Sümer, ''Safevi Devletinin Kuruluşu ve Gelişmesinde Anadolu Türklerinin Rolü'', Türk Tarih Kurumu Yayınları, Ankara, 1992, p. 15. {{in lang|tr}}</ref> who would aid in him establishing his dynasty.

=== Ottoman Era ===
After entering the Ottoman administration, Erzincan developed physically and in terms of population. According to the census made in 1516–1518 right after the conquest, there were twenty neighbourhoods in the city, seven of which belonged to Muslims and 13 to Christians. The number of neighbourhoods did not change in the 1530 and 1591 censuses but the population increased.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ERZİNCAN |url=https://islamansiklopedisi.org.tr/erzincan |access-date=2023-03-26 |website=TDV İslâm Ansiklopedisi |language=tr}}</ref> [[Evliya Çelebi]], who came to Erzincan in 1647, wrote that the castle was built on a flat field, and that there were 200 houses inside this place while 1800 houses were located outside the castle.

==== Battle of Erzincan ====
{{main article|Battle of Erzincan}}
The Battle of Erzincan took place during the [[Caucasus Campaign]] of the First World War. In 1916 Erzincan was the headquarters for the [[Third Army (Ottoman Empire)|Turkish Third Army]] commanded by [[Abdul Kerim Pasha]]. The Russian General [[Nikolai Yudenich]] led the [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Russian Caucasus Army]] who captured [[Tercan|Mama Hatun]] on 12 July 1916. They then gained the heights of Naglika and took a Turkish position on the banks of the Durum Durasi river, with their cavalry breaking through the Boz-Tapa-Meretkli line. They then advanced on Erzincan arriving by 25 July and taking the city in two days. The city was relatively untouched by battle and Yudenich seized large quantities of supplies. Despite the strategic advantages gained from this victory, Yudenich made no more significant advances and his forces were reduced due to Russian reverses further north.<ref>''World War I: A Student Encyclopedia'' by John S.D. Eisenhower (Foreword), Spencer Tucker, Priscilla Mary Roberts (Ed.s)</ref>

==== Erzincan Soviet ====
A short-lived soviet council had been at Erzincan between 1916 and 1918. Mainly today's Erzincan and [[Tunceli]] provinces were under Russian occupation. After the revolution, Bolshevik soldiers took control of the officer corps. [[Arshak Jamalyan|Arshak Djamalian]] who was a Bolshevik soldier, called Kurdish, Turkish, and Armenian representatives to take charge of the administration of Erzincan Soviet.<ref name="Erzincan">{{in lang|tr}} [[Kâzım Karabekir|Karabekir, Kâzım]].

Following the withdrawal of the Russian Army, the commander of the First Caucasian Army Corps [[Kâzım Karabekir]] regained control over Erzincan on the 13 February 1918.

==== 1939 Erzincan earthquake ====
{{main|1939 Erzincan earthquake}}
[[File:Erzincan_Airport_Terminal.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The airport terminal]]
The city was completely destroyed by a major earthquake on December 27, 1939. The sequence of seven violent shocks, the biggest measuring 7.8 on the moment magnitude scale, was the joint most-powerful earthquake recorded in Turkey, tied with the [[2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake]]. The first stage of the earthquake killed about 8,000 people. The next day, it was reported that the death toll had risen to 20,000. An emergency relief operation began. By the end of the year, 32,962 had died due to more earthquakes and several floods. So extensive was the damage to Erzincan city that its old site was entirely abandoned, and a new town was founded a little further to the north.
