'''Nam Định''' ({{audio|Nam Dinh.ogg|listen|help=no}}) is a city in the [[Red River Delta]] of northern [[Vietnam]]. It is the capital of [[Nam Định Province]] and is well known as the birthplace of [[Pho]]. The city of Nam Định is 90&nbsp;km southeast of Vietnam's capital, [[Hanoi]]. From August 18–20 of each year, there is a festival held in Nam Định called the [[Cố Trạch Temple|Cố Trạch]]. This celebration honors General [[Trần Hưng Đạo]], a 13th-century national hero who led Vietnamese forces to victory over the invading [[Mongols]].

==Name==
The name of the city, under [[Trần dynasty]], was '''Thiên Trường''' (天長) meant "where the Sky remains for Eternity". It is first mentioned to mark the birth of the city in 1262 by Emperor [[Trần Thái Tông]]. The name Thiên Trường was probably the name for a whole [[phủ]], which at the time would be equivalent to a special prefecture or province nowadays. Under [[Trần dynasty]], the city was considered to be the second capital, besides [[Hanoi|Thăng Long]].

Under [[Lê dynasty]], the city belonged to the Prefecture of '''Sơn Nam''' (山南), meant "Southern Mountains" or "to the South of the Mountains" in 1466 by Emperor [[Lê Thánh Tông]], and '''Sơn Nam Hạ''' (山南下), meant "The South Prefecture of the Southern Mountains" in compared to '''Sơn Nam Thượng''' (山南上), meant "The North Prefecture of the Southern Mountains".

The modern name of the city, '''Nam Định''', was first mentioned in 1831 under the reign of Emperor [[Minh Mạng]] of the [[Nguyễn dynasty]] as the capital of Nam Định Province.
