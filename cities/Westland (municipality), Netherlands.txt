Towns and other settlements: [[De Lier]], [['s-Gravenzande]], [[Monster, Netherlands|Monster]], [[Naaldwijk]], [[Wateringen]], [[Heenweg]], [[Honselersdijk]], [[Kwintsheul]], [[Maasdijk, Westland|Maasdijk]], [[Poeldijk]], and [[Ter Heijde]].

==History==
Westland was created on 1 January 2004 by a merger of the municipalities De Lier, 's-Gravenzande, Monster, Naaldwijk and Wateringen.<ref>[http://wetten.overheid.nl/cgi-bin/deeplink/law1/title=Wet%20tot%20gemeentelijke%20herindeling%20van%20het%20Westland Law on merger, in Dutch, with map]</ref> These are also the names of five of the [[town|settlements]]. The others are Heenweg, Honselersdijk, Kwintsheul, Maasdijk, Poeldijk, and Ter Heijde. Westland itself is not the name of a settlement or town, but rather of the region. The City hall is located in the middle of Westland, in Naaldwijk, the second largest [[town|settlement]] in Westland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gemeentewestland.nl/smartsite.shtml?id=5902&ch=INT |title=Gemeente Westland |website=www.gemeentewestland.nl |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922044352/http://www.gemeentewestland.nl/smartsite.shtml?id=5902&ch=INT |archive-date=2008-09-22}} </ref>

The town of Honselersdijk also possesses the largest Flower Auction, [[FloraHolland]], which also has a location in [[Rijnsburg]]. This is a very important sector of the Westland [[economy]]. Flowers produced in Westland are sold all over the world.

Coastal towns are Ter Heijde (near Monster), Monster itself and 's-Gravenzande. These towns are popular with [[Germany|Germans]] and people from the Eastern Netherlands. It is not unknown for every holiday campsite to be fully booked with tourists because of their relative proximity to the more popular [[Scheveningen]].

==Wider area==
[[File:2013-Westland.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|left|Dutch Topographic map of Westland, July 2013]]
Westland is part of the [[Haaglanden]] conurbation.

In a wider sense, [[Westland, region of the Netherlands|Westland]] is also the name of the region south-west of the line [[The Hague]] - [[Delft]] - [[Rotterdam]], approximately consisting of the municipalities Westland and [[Midden-Delfland]], as well as [[Hook of Holland]] (municipality of [[Rotterdam]]).

Westland is most known for its horticulture in [[greenhouse]]s, growing [[flower]]s and [[vegetable]]s.
