The commune spans an area around the harbor of {{convert|1429.3|sqkm|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="INE"/> The average temperature in the city lies around {{convert|14|C}}, and precipitation is low.

==History==
The area was originally occupied by indigenous people, who used it as a settlement and for fishing purposes. The natural harbor in Coquimbo was taken over by [[Pedro de Valdivia]] from Spain in 1550. In 1879 it was recognized as a town. The city was on the main path of totality of the [[Solar eclipse of July 2, 2019]].

===English settlement===
Coquimbo was first mentioned in the English speaking world when [[Charles Darwin]] visited during his voyage on [[HMS Beagle]], stopping in the town on 14 May 1835 describing the town as "remarkable for nothing but its extreme quietness."<ref name="English-1">{{cite web |title=HD British Coquimbo |url=https://www.akorndmc.com/destinations/latin-america/chile/recommendeditineraries/hd-british-coquimbo/ |website=akorndmc.com |access-date=1 May 2024}}</ref> Starting in the mid 1800s tens of thousands of Englishmen moved to Coquimbo establishing a distinct English architectural and culinary legacy.<ref name="English-1" /> English settlement was fueled by the gold and copper industry in the region which peaked in 1860, the same time as the construction of a large English cemetery.<ref name="English-1" />

==Demographics==
According to the 2002 census of the [[National Statistics Institute (Chile)|National Statistics Institute]], Coquimbo had 163,036 inhabitants (79,428 men and 83,608 women).

The commune is represented in the [[Senate of Chile|Senate]] by Gonzalo Uriarte ([[Independent Democratic Union|UDI]]) and Jorge Pizarro Soto ([[Christian Democratic Party|PDC]]) as part of the 4th senatorial constituency (Coquimbo Region).

==Economy==

It is an access point for beach towns to the south, such as [[Guanaqueros]] and [[Tongoy]]. The port is still important for shipping, especially fruit and copper from mines in the region. Wine is also produced in the area.
