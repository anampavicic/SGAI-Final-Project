Marand is among the major cities of East Azerbaijan province. It is in the northwest of the capital of the province, [[Tabriz]]. Marand has been known by various names in history, such as Maryana, Mandagarana, and Maranda.

==Etymology==
Moritz von Kotzebue and [[August von Haxthausen]] both described local legends that placed the burial spot of [[Noah]]'s wife at Marand.  Both authors contended that the name of the city means "the mother lies here," referring to Noah's wife.<ref name="Kotzebue">{{cite book|last=Kotzebue|first=Moritz von|title=Narrative of a Journey into Persia, in the Suite of the Imperial Russian Embassy, in the Year 1817|url=https://archive.org/details/narrativeajourn01kotzgoog|publisher=Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown|location=London|date=1819|pages=[https://archive.org/details/narrativeajourn01kotzgoog/page/n161 143]–146}}</ref><ref name="Haxthausen">{{cite book|last=Haxthausen|first=Baron August von|author-link=August von Haxthausen|translator=John Edward Taylor|others=Introduction by Pietro A.

{{Quote|text=Of Maranda, it is likewise asserted by the local [[Armenians]], that Noah's immediate descendants settled there, and even that it is the place of his wife's interment. Who could have neglected the sight of such a hallowed ground? Curiosity led us to the spot, and we found that the Moslems had built, on the place where Noah's wife is reported to have been buried, a chapel, with bare walls, which are not so cleanly as the religion of Mahomet prescribes. When the chapel was finished, nobody, however, would undertake to point out the actual spot where the body lay. A miracle solved their doubts. Thirty-eight years ago, during an earthquake, the ground opened, and two Mollahs (Moslem priests), of whom we saw one in the chapel, together with several inhabitants, witnessed the sudden appearance of a large tomb of stone, which, however, soon vanished in the opening. From that time, true believers have been convinced that Noah's wife lies interred there; although it would seem, that the honour of actual sepulture is a point at issue between her and Noah's mother, as Maranda signifies, in the [[Armenian language]], the "mother lies here." This grave, perhaps, contributed to induce the [Imperial Russian] Ambassador to rest here a day.<ref name="Kotzebue"/>}}

==History==
The history of the town goes back to the pre-Islamic era.<ref name="Minorsky"/>  Between 815 till 850, Marand was primarily controlled by [[Mohammad ibn Ba'ith]] who was Iranicized to a considerable extent.<ref name="Minorsky">Minorsky, “Marand” in ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''. P. Bearman , Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs (eds.). Vol. 6, (1991): p. 504 "According to one of al-Tabari's authorities (iii, 1388), the shaykhs of Maragha who praised the bravery and literary ability (adab) of Ibn Bai'th also quoted his Persian verses (bi'l-fdrisiyya). This important passage, already quoted by Barthold, BSOS, ii (1923), 836–8, is evidence of the existence of the cultivation of poetry in Persian in north-western Persia at the beginning of the 9th century. Ibn Bai’th must have been Iranicised to a considerable extent, and, as has been mentioned, he relied for support on the non-Arab elements in his Rustakhs (‘Uludj Rasatikhi’)”</ref>  The elders of Maragha who quoted his Persian poetry also praised his bravery and his literary ability.<ref name="Minorsky"/>  He was Iranicized to considerable extent and the statement of Tabari on him is evidence of the existence of the cultivation of poetry in Persian in northwest Persia at the beginning of the 9th century.<ref name="Minorsky"/>
