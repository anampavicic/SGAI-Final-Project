In 1864, Shimla was declared the [[summer capital]] of [[British Raj|British India]]. After [[Indian independence movement|independence]], the city became the capital of [[East Punjab]] and was later made the capital city of Himachal Pradesh. It is the principal commercial, cultural and educational centre of the state.

Small hamlets were recorded before 1815 when British forces took control of the area. The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of the [[Himalayas]]. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the [[Simla Deputation|Simla Deputation of 1906]], the [[Simla Convention|Simla Accord of 1914]] and the [[Simla Conference|Simla Conference of 1945]]. After independence, the state of [[Himachal Pradesh]] came into being in 1948 as a result of the integration of 28 [[princely state]]s. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the [[Simla Agreement|Simla Agreement of 1972]]. After the reorganisation of the state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla.

Shimla is home to several buildings that are styled in the [[Tudorbethan]] and [[neo-Gothic]] architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples, and the natural environment of the city attract tourists. Major city centre's attractions include the ''[[Shri Hanuman Jakhu (Statue)]],'' [[Jakhu Temple]], [[Rashtrapati Niwas|Viceregal Lodge]], [[Christ Church (Shimla)|Christ Church]], [[Mall Road, Shimla|Mall Road]], [[The Ridge, Shimla|The Ridge]] and [[Annadale, Shimla|Annadale]]. The city centre's northernmost point is Jakhoo and the southernmost location is Annadale, the easternmost point is [[Sanjauli]] and the western point is Chotta Shimla. The [[Kalka–Shimla Railway]] line built by the British, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race [[MTB Himalaya]], which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest [[Ice rink|natural ice skating rink]] in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with several colleges and research institutions.

== Etymology ==
One theory suggests that the name "Shimla" was derived from ''Shyamalaya'', meaning 'blue house', a solitary house made of blue slate on Jakhu Hill, built by a [[fakir]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Shimla Town |url=https://hpshimla.nic.in/history |website=District Shimla |access-date=15 September 2023}}</ref>

According to another version, the city gets its name from ''Shamli'' or ''[[Matangi|Shyamala]]'', meaning 'blue lady', referring to the goddess [[Kali]]. It is believed that a temple dedicated to goddess Shamli, an incarnation of Kali, used to be on the [[Jakhu Temple|Jakhu]] hillside near the Rothney Castle{{explain|reason=What is Rothney Castle, Shimla?|date=October 2024}}. Many believe that during the [[British Raj|British period]], the image of the goddess was shifted to a new place, the now-famous [[Kali Bari, Shimla|Kali Bari Temple]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Stunning facts about Shimla no one told you before|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/travel/destinations/stunning-facts-about-shimla-no-one-told-you-before/as67179017.cms|access-date=10 June 2020|newspaper=The Times of India}}</ref>

In 2018, the [[Government of Himachal Pradesh|state government]] decided to change the city's name from Shimla to Shyamala.<ref>{{cite news |title=Now, Shimla may get renamed as Shyamala |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/simla-shimla-renaming-shyamala-himachal-pradesh-shimla-name-change-bjp-1372288-2018-10-21 |access-date=31 August 2020 |work=India Today |date=21 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref> However, seeing the negative response of the general public, the state government dismissed the plan.<ref>{{cite web|author=Scroll Staff|title=Himachal Pradesh is not considering any proposal to change Shimla's name to Shyamala, says CM|url=https://scroll.in/latest/899320/himachal-pradesh-is-not-considering-any-proposal-to-change-shimlas-name-to-shyamala-says-cm|access-date=10 June 2020|website=Scroll.in|date=23 October 2018 |language=en-US}}</ref>

==History==
Most of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only sign of civilisation was the [[Jakhu Temple]] and a few scattered houses.<ref name="Vipin1996">{{cite book | author=Vipin Pubby | title=Shimla Then and Now | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UrZ-ibfhMyMC&pg=PA17 | access-date=16 August 2013 | year=1996 | publisher=Indus Publishing | isbn=978-81-7387-046-0 | pages=17–34}}</ref> The area was called 'Shimla', perhaps named after a [[Hindu goddess]], ''Shyamala Devi'', an incarnation of [[Kali]].<ref name="hpshimla.nic.in"/>

[[File:Shimla, 1850s.jpg|left|thumb|The bridge connecting Shimla with Chhota Shimla, originally erected in 1829 by [[Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere|Lord Combermere]], Shimla, the 1850s]]
The area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by [[Bhimsen Thapa]] of [[Kingdom of Nepal|Nepal]] in 1806. The [[British East India Company]] took control of the territory as per the [[Sugauli Treaty]] after the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] (1814–16). The [[Gurkha]] leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of [[David Ochterlony]] in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as "a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the [[Hill States of India#|Hill States]], set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the [[Scotland|Scottish]] civil servant [[Charles Pratt Kennedy]] built the first [[pucca housing|pucca house]] in the area named Kennedy Cottage in 1822, near [[Annadale, Shimla|Annadale]], what is now the home for CPWD office. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, [[William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst|William Amherst]], the [[Governor-General of Bengal]], visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, [[Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere|Stapleton Cotton]], the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near [[Jakhoo]]. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of [[Keonthal]] and [[Patiala]] in exchange for the Rawin [[pargana]] and a portion of the Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141 houses in 1881.<ref name="Vipin1996"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Harrop, F. Beresford| publisher=Thacker, Spink & Co.|place=Simla| year=1925| title=Thacker's new Guide to Simla| pages=16–19}}</ref>

In 1832, Shimla saw its first political meeting between the Governor-General [[Lord William Bentinck]] and the emissaries of [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]]. In a letter to Colonel Churchill, he wrote:<ref>Researches and Missionary Labours Among the Jews, Mohammedans, and Other Sects By Joseph Wolff, published by O. Rogers, 1837</ref>
{{cquote|Shimla is only four days march from Loodianah ([[Ludhiana]]), is easy to access, and proves a very agreeable refuge from the burning plains of Hindoostaun ([[Hindustan]]).}}
[[File:Jakku Temple Simla.jpg|thumb|left|Jakhu Temple in 1910; the temple predates the British settlement in the area]]
Combermere's successor [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Earl Dalhousie]] visited Shimla in the same year. After this, the town was under Nawab (King) Kumar Ghosal of Bally, West Bengal, and saw regular visits from the Governors-General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. Several young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties, and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, several bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from [[Sood (surname)|Sood]] and [[Parsi]] communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844, the foundation of the [[Christ Church (Shimla)|Christ Church]] was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the [[National Highway 22 (India)|Hindustan-Tibet road]] with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851–52. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851–52.<ref name="tunnel">{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080206/himplus1.htm#2 |title=Shimla A five-tunnel town|publisher=tribuneindia.com|access-date=16 August 2015}}</ref> The [[1857 uprising]] caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.<ref name="Vipin1996"/>

In 1863, the [[Viceroy of India]], [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|John Lawrence]], decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla.<ref name="Vipin1996" /> He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between [[Calcutta]] and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, even though it was difficult to reach.<ref name="ReferenceA">[[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]], ''[[Kipling Sahib]]'', London, Little Brown, 2007</ref> [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Robert Bulwer-Lytton]] ([[Viceroy of India]] 1876–1880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a [[Rashtrapati Niwas|Viceregal Lodge]], later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the "Upper Bazaar" nowadays known as the [[The Ridge, Shimla|Ridge]]<ref name="harassed">{{cite book | author=Hari Sud | title=Entrepreneurs of British Shimla | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8aRBQAAQBAJ | access-date=15 August 2015 | year=2013 | publisher=Lulu | isbn=978-1-304-11357-3 | pages=73–74}}</ref>), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the [[Middle Bazaar, Shimla|Middle]] and [[Lower Bazaar, Shimla|Lower Bazaars]] on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as a library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration.

[[File:Simla QE4 24.jpg|right|thumb|Shimla's "[[Lower Bazaar, Shimla|Lower Bazaar]]" in a photograph taken between 1887 and 1889]]
During the "Hot Weather", Shimla was also the headquarters of the [[Commander-in-Chief, India]], the head of the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]], and many departments of [[Government of India|the government]]. The summer capital of the regional Government of the [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] moved from [[Murree]], in modern-day Pakistan, to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed the Shimla Society, which, according to [[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]],<ref>''[[Kipling Sahib]]'', London, Little Brown, 2007: p. 134</ref> "was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust." This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants, and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as [[Rudyard Kipling]] said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for "frivolity, gossip, and intrigue".<ref name="heritage report">{{cite web | url = http://himachal.nic.in/tcp/ShimlaHeritageReport.pdf | title = Heritage of Shimla | publisher = Town & Country Planning Department, Shimla | access-date = 4 May 2007 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070630171701/http://himachal.nic.in/tcp/ShimlaHeritageReport.pdf | archive-date = 30 June 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

The {{convert|500|ft|adj=on}} Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang. The Elysium Tunnel (now known as the Auckland Tunnel), about {{convert|120|ft}} in length, was also built in 1905.<ref name="tunnel" />

The [[Simla Convention]], an ambiguous [[treaty]] concerning the status of Tibet negotiated by representatives of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], [[Tibet (1912–1951)|Tibet]] and Great Britain was signed in Simla in 1913 and 1914.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tibet Justice Center – Legal Materials on Tibet – Treaties and Conventions Relating to Tibet – Convention Between Great Britain, China, and Tibet, Simla (1914) [400]|url=http://www.tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties16.html|access-date=9 July 2020|website=www.tibetjustice.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Hoffmann|first=Steven A.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BpSRwC5_EPUC|title=India and the China Crisis|date=1 January 1990|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-06537-6|language=en}}</ref> At the convention a demarcation line between [[Tibet]] and the [[Northeast India|North-east region]] of India was proposed by Sir [[Henry McMahon]]. The line came to be known as McMahon Line and is currently the effective boundary between China and India, although its legal status is disputed by the Chinese government. This was also the site of a series of talks held by [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Viceroy Wavell]] to discuss a plan for the independence of India with the Indian political leaders of the time. Known as the Simla Conference, the talks failed to bring about a resolution.

Shimla was the capital city in exile of [[British Burma]] (present-day [[Myanmar]]) from 1942 to 1945.<ref name="IE2018">{{cite news |last1=Chowdhury |first1=Adrija Roy |title=Shimla could have been named after Goddess Shamli, but there was no Simla before the British. |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/research/shimla-rename-shyamala-himachal-pradesh-shamli-5415941/ |access-date=24 October 2018 |newspaper=The Indian Express |date=24 October 2018}}</ref>

The [[Kalka–Shimla Railway|Kalka–Shimla railway line]], opened in 1903, added to Shimla's accessibility and popularity. The railway route from Kalka to Shimla, with more than 806 bridges and 103 tunnels, was touted as an engineering feat and came to be known as the "British Jewel of the Orient".<ref name="heritage report" /> In 2008, it became part of the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/944 |title=Unesco|publisher=Unesco.org|access-date=14 October 2012}}</ref> Following the [[partition of India]], it briefly served as the capital of East Punjab, until construction of the new city of [[Chandigarh]] (the present-day capital of the Indian states of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] and [[Haryana]]). Upon the formation of the state of [[Himachal Pradesh]] in 1971, Shimla was named its capital.

After independence, the Chief Commissioner's Province of H.P. came into being on 15 April 1948 as a result of the integration of 28 petty princely states (including feudatory princes and zaildars) in the promontories of the western [[Himalaya]], known in full as the Shimla Hills States and four Punjab southern hill states by the issue of the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948 under Sections 3 and 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (later renamed as the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1947 vide A.O. of 1950). The State of Bilaspur was merged into the Himachal Pradesh on 1 April 1954 by the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954. Himachal became a part C state on 26 January 1950 with the implementation of the [[Constitution of India]] and the Lt. Governor was appointed. The legislative assembly was elected in 1952.
