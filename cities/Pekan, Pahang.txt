'''Pekan''' is a town in [[Pekan District]], [[Pahang]], [[Malaysia]]. It is also the royal capital of the state. Its name comes from a flower, the ''[[Brunfelsia latifolia|Bunga Pekan]]''. Pekan is also the name of [[Pekan District|the district]] the town is situated in, and a parliamentary constituency in its own right. It is the home of the state's royal family headed by Sultan [[Abdullah of Pahang]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.malaysianmonarchy.org.my/portal_bi/rk3/rk3a.php?id=rk3_7 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050412140149/http://www.malaysianmonarchy.org.my/portal_bi/rk3/rk3a.php?id=rk3_7 |archive-date=12 April 2005 |title=Yand di-Pertuan Agong VII |work= Malaysian Monarchy }}</ref> It is also the hometown of the second [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], [[Tun Abdul Razak|Tun Abdul Razak Hussein]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pmo.gov.my/website/webdb.nsf/vALLDOC/1B354E2FCD2DEB3D48256D52001A44A1|title = Prime Minister's Office of Malaysia - Dato' Sri Ismail Sabri Yaakob : Home}}</ref>

The Masjid Abdullah, a landmark in Pekan which dates from the 1920s, and the newer [[Abu Bakar Royal Mosque]] is near the Sultan Abu Bakar Museum. The stretch by the river bank from the Abu Bakar Royal Mosque heading towards the Sultan Abu Bakar Museum is Pekan's Heritage Route.

==History==
According to local lore, a flowering plant named ''Bunga Pekan'' used to grow wild along the banks of [[Pahang River]], and the town was therefore so named.  The flower is said to be white like [[jasmine]], although the particular plant species is also said to have become extinct. The river at the Pekan town (near Mengkasar village) is also called Pekan River, however there is no evidence that Pekan derived its name from this river.<ref name="history">{{cite web |url=http://www.mdpekan.gov.my/en/web/guest/sejarah-penubuhan |title=Pekan's Early History |work=Pekan District Council |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708062100/http://www.mdpekan.gov.my/en/web/guest/sejarah-penubuhan |archive-date=8 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Other sources say the name "Pekan" came from "Pekan Sehari" (Pekan Sehari or Sunday Market still exists today), and the word "Sehari" was eventually omitted and the locals simply called it "Pekan".{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Pekan is thought to have been in existence since the time of [[Old Pahang Kingdom]]. The old name was [[Inderapura]], although it was also commonly known with the short form 'Pura', which some Malays called Pekan. The old capital was located on both the left and right banks of Sungai Pahang and Sungai Pahang Tua up to Tanjung Langgar. The town was divided into Pekan Baharu and Pekan Lama (New and Old Pekan), and the old name for Pekan Baharu used to be Kampung Cina. Several [[Arab]] and Chinese writers mentioned Pekan.<ref name="history"/>

During the late 19th century, relations between the sultan and local villagers were close. For example, when a gong in the palace was struck, local villagers would assemble to the palace for the sultan's service such as accompanying him on a hunting expedition.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Shennan |first=Margaret |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8iYXCwAAQBAJ |title=Out in the Midday Sun: The British in Malaya 1880-1960 |date=2015-11-01 |publisher=Monsoon Books |isbn=978-981-4625-32-6 |language=en |chapter=Chaper 1}}</ref>

The villagers at Kampong Mengkasar, about one kilometre from Pekan in the direction of Kuantan, are said to be direct descendants of Tok Tuan from [[Makassar]] in [[Sulawesi]], Indonesia. Among the well-known figures, [[Abdul Razak Hussein|Tun Abdul Razak]] was recognised as having a Sulawesi heritage.

==Transport==

From [[Kuala Lumpur]], one may travel to Pekan by the [[East Coast Expressway]], exiting at the [[Gambang Interchange]] to the [[Tun Razak Highway]]. From [[Johor]], a scenic coastal road passes through [[Kuala Rompin]]. Alternatively, the [[Tun Razak Highway]] can be taken, which links [[Segamat]] and [[Kuantan]].

==Places of interest==

=== Sultan Abu Bakar Museum===
[[File:Sultan abu bakar museum, pekan.jpg|thumb|[[Sultan Abu Bakar Museum]].]]
The [[Sultan Abu Bakar Museum]] displays many artefacts which are important in the state's history and the local [[Malay people|Malay]] culture. The museum was officially opened by [[Ahmad Shah of Pahang|Sultan Ahmad Shah]] in October 1976. It is located in the former residence of the British [[Resident (title)|Resident]], which was built in 1929. It was acquired by the [[Sultan of Pahang]] in 1948 and was renamed Kota Beram Palace. In 1965, the Sultan moved his residence to a new palace (the Abu Bakar Palace), where the current Royal Palace is situated.

The museum was officially opened to the public in October 1976, in conjunction with the birthday celebrations of the Sultan of Pahang. The first chairman of the museum was the late YBhg. Dato' Haji Mohd Mokhtar bin Haji Daud, and the first director/curator was YBhg. Dato' Mohamed Mokhtar bin Haji Abu Bakar. The museum expanded its collections of artefacts very actively during this era up to 1997. The locals eagerly surrendered and provided as gifts certain unique artefacts to the museum. One example of these is a [[keris]] (a type of Malay dagger) which was found by a young man in a river about 20&nbsp;km from the town of Pekan. This particular keris drew a lot of attention, coupled with strange stories of its mystical prowess. The keris is still on display at the museum.

The museum has dedicated galleries focusing on water transportation, personal belongings of the late [[Abu Bakar of Pahang|Sultan Abu Bakar]] and the late [[Tengku Afzan|Tengku Ampuan Pahang Tengku Afzan]].

As of October 2008, the museum has been undergoing renovations. Visitors are advised to call the museum first for more information.

===The Chiefs' Rest House===
Pekan is home to the Chiefs' Rest House. This wooden structure was completed in 1926 and is featured in the '[[Lonely Planet]]' Travel Guide as a must-visit site in Pekan. It was originally built by the British as a guest house for the Chieftains in Pahang who visited Pekan to attend meetings and events at the Istana. Until today, the Chiefs' Rest House offers good, clean and reasonable accommodation to travellers.

Most of the furnitures adorning this building were brought over from the Istana. It is advisable to reserve your room in advance, as it can be packed during school holidays, weekends and whenever there are functions in the Istana. The Chiefs' Rest House is located along Jalan Istana Abu Bakar in Pekan. It is along the road approaching the Istana area.

Breakfast menu is aplenty to choose from. One particular novelty for breakfast is the 'roti naik' (a heavenly treat. Looks similar to small buns sold in supermarkets, but with a completely different taste, especially when it is hot). This particular bread can only be found in very few places, Pekan being one of them. Other delicacies are nasi dagang, kuih bakar, ikan bakar (fresh grilled fish) and others.

Kampong Mengkasar is also well known of its [[Murtabak]]. It is a unique variant of the original Indian dish that can only be found in Pekan.
