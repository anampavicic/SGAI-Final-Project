Rafsanjan is the biggest producer of [[pistachio]]s in the world. The [[Sarcheshmeh]] copper mines are among the largest in the world. In addition, the biggest and oldest mud-house in the world is in Rafsanjan. The city is also a major center of [[carpet]] production, although the rugs are sold as [[Kerman]]i rugs rather than Rafsanjani ones.

==Etymology== 
The origin of the name Rafsanjan is believed to have roots in [[Old Persian]]. According to one theory, the name is derived from the words "Rafsan" and "Kan," which in Old Persian mean "copper" and "mine," respectively. These two words gave rise to the original name of the city, "Rafsangan," which later transformed into its current [[Arabic]] version, "Rafsanjan."

Another theory suggests that the original name of the city was "Sanjan." Due to its location in the path of floods, the city suffered significant destruction and was renamed "Raft Sanjan" and then "Rafsanjan" among the people. It changed from “Raf” to “Raft”; adding a letter changes the meaning of the word in [[Persian language|Farsi]] to “sweeping”, signifying the damage of the grand rapids. According to a [[legend]], the city was renamed "Rafsanjan" after a massive [[Rapids|rapid]] occurred in the area, resulting in the change from "Sanjan" to "Rafsanjan."

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2023}}
About the origin and creation of this city there are significant rhetorical stories. At the period of Qajar kingdom and under Naser-Aldin-Shah's reign, Rafsanjan was named az “Anas” and was part of Fars province; after a while it came under the control of Kerman’s government. In the history, Rafsanjan has been named as an important city due to being on the crossroad between Kerman and Yazd. At the end of Safavieh kingdom, Afghans attacked this city and caused disaster and catastrophe. The low rate of prosperity after mentioned attack was stretched until Qajar’s kingdom and the city was almost ruined until that time. In 1787, Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar attacked the  city and people decided to acquiesce in order to end the war, so he conquered the city without violence. In 1866, Ebrahim Khan Zahiradole (the
governor of Kerman) ordered to reshape and rebuild the city. Buildings were constructed and the situation started to improve. In 1913, Amir Mofkhem Bakhtiari ordered to build a strong wall around the city which part of ruins still remain today. This step caused importance and accredit to the city. For the first time in 1938, crossroads were built in the city, which are named as Emam Khomeyni, Enghelab, and Shohada these days.
Rafsanjan was also an important city due to high production of cotton earlier on time. Because of the high quality of this product, it was exported to India and Russia. In 1945, Rafsanjan was assigned as a 
township. Nowadays, Rafsanjan is considered as a of the most crowded cities of Kerman with major industries, oil depots, and agricultural mega-farms  that have an undeniable role in the economy of province and country. Such mineral and agricultural products are well-known not only in Iran, but all around the world.

==Geography==
Rafsanjan is located in south part of the [[Lut desert]], in north-west of [[Kerman province]]. The longitude of this city is 56 degrees east and the latitude is 30 degrees south. The Average distance between Kerman and this city is {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The city has an airport and railway (Tehran-Bandar Abbas route). Moreover, the altitude is {{convert|1460|m|ft|abbr=on}} and the land-measurement is approximately {{convert|10687|km|mi|abbr=on}}. North part of Rafsanjan has a common frontier with [[Bafgh]] and [[Zarand, Iran|Zarand]]; south part is neighboring with [[Bardsir]] and on west side with [[Anar, Iran|Anar]] and [[Shahre-Babak]]; finally east side of this city is neighboring with [[Kerman]] and Zarand. Rafsanjan has two seasonal rivers named as [[Shour]] and [[Giouderi]]. The mountains in the area are part of [[Zagros range]], and [[Sarcheshmeh]] and [[Davaran (mountain)|Davaran]] are the most famous.

===Climate===
{{POV section|date=May 2023|talk=POV Climate}}

=== Environment ===
Rafsanjan has been exposed to the polluting smoke of [[Sarcheshme]], [[Khatunabad]] and [[Shahrbabak]] copper smelters. On the other hand, up to 14 pistachio orchards are sprayed every year, as a result, dozens of tons of poison are released in the pistachio orchards of Rafsanjan. The level of arsenic contamination in Rafsanjan water is about ten times the permissible limit, and it is strongly recommended to use authorized water purification devices for drinking water, and to ensure the health of the water purification device, the water produced by the device should also be tested.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Mirzaei Aminiyan |first1=Milad |last2=Baalousha |first2=Mohammed |last3=Mousavi |first3=Rouhollah |last4=Mirzaei Aminiyan |first4=Farzad |last5=Hosseini |first5=Hamideh |last6=Heydariyan |first6=Amin |date=May 2018 |title=The ecological risk, source identification, and pollution assessment of heavy metals in road dust: a case study in Rafsanjan, SE Iran |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28255819/ |journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research International |volume=25 |issue=14 |pages=13382–13395 |doi=10.1007/s11356-017-8539-y |issn=1614-7499 |pmid=28255819|s2cid=4036346 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Hakimi |first1=Hamid |last2=Ahmadi |first2=Jafar |last3=Vakilian |first3=Alireza |last4=Jamalizadeh |first4=Ahmad |last5=Kamyab |first5=Zahra |last6=Mehran |first6=Mahya |last7=Malekzadeh |first7=Reza |last8=Poustchi |first8=Hossein |last9=Eghtesad |first9=Sareh |last10=Sardari |first10=Farimah |last11=Soleimani |first11=Mohammadreza |last12=Khademalhosseini |first12=Morteza |last13=Abolghasemi |first13=Mohammadreza |last14=Mohammadi |first14=Movahedeh |last15=Sadeghi |first15=Tabandeh |date=2021-02-01 |title=The profile of Rafsanjan Cohort Study |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10654-020-00668-7 |journal=European Journal of Epidemiology |language=en |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=243–252 |doi=10.1007/s10654-020-00668-7 |pmid=32725579 |s2cid=220809495 |issn=1573-7284}}</ref>

==Pistachio industry==
Rafsanjan, a semiarid region in central Iran, is renowned for its high-quality pistachio production, generating nearly $1 billion annually. <ref name="auto">{{Cite web |last= |first= |title=Historic Data |url=https://iranpistachio.org/en/statistical-archive/historic-data |access-date=2023-04-27 |website=Iran Pistachio Association {{!}} Official Site |language=en-gb}}</ref> The Iranian government has provided energy and water subsidies over the past several decades, attracting producers to the area, where more than 30,000 people are directly involved in the production by owning or managing pistachio orchards.<ref>{{Cite web |title=FAOSTAT |url=https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/ |access-date=2023-04-27 |website=www.fao.org}}</ref><ref name="auto"/>
However, economically viable pistachio production requires specific climatic conditions, such as long, hot summers and sufficient chill in winters, which occur in areas far from surface water resources like rivers or lakes, making the crop water-intensive.<ref>Benmoussa H, Luedeling E, Ghrab M, Ben Yahmed J, Ben MM. 2017. Performance of Pistachio ( L.) in warming Mediterranean Orchards. Environmental and Experimental Botany 140: 76–85.</ref><ref>Elloumi O, Ghrab M, Kessentini H, Ben MM. 2013. Chilling accumulation effects on performance of pistachio trees cv. Mateur in dry and warm area climate.

According to reports from the late 1980s, the Rafsanjani family is said to "control" Iran's multimillion-dollar pistachio market centered around the town of Rafsanjan.<ref>{{cite news| title=Wrong ways on a 'righteous path' |work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=20 February 1989 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1989/02/20/wrong-ways-on-a-righteous-path/48401178-76ed-4bea-9708-2dab530e34a7/ | access-date=27 May 2023}}</ref> [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani|Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]], former Iranian president and one of the most powerful members of the regime in Iran, was the head of the parliamentary speaker and had close ties to the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)]] construction firm, which built most of Iran's infrastructure, including dams.
<ref name="anarchy">{{Cite web |title="I am thirsty": statements from Soheil Arabi and the Federation of Anarchism Era on the uprising in Iran {{!}} libcom.org |url=https://libcom.org/article/i-am-thirsty-statements-soheil-arabi-and-federation-anarchism-era-uprising-iran |access-date=2023-04-27 |website=libcom.org |language=en}}</ref> These dams were used to redirect water to the agricultural fields of high-ranking members of the regime, including the Rafsanjani family, resulting in a water mafia-like scenario.<ref name="anarchy" />

=== Land rights ===
In the region, although communal “garden ownership” (baghcheh-dari) was prevalent among villagers, absentee landlords still held a virtual [[monopoly]] over the ownership of the basin's land and water resources.<ref name="womenjournal">{{cite book|title= Women's Studies at York Series|edition=First|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=York|year=1993|page=117-118}}</ref> This is due to orchards being exempted from redistribution under the [[Iranian Land Reform|Iranian Land Reform Programme of 1962]], which sought to [[White Revolution|abolish the feudal system]] and redistribute arable land from large landowners to smaller agricultural workers. At the end of the 80s, a survey done in two Rafsanjan villages revealed that villagers owned only about 17% of the water and cultivated land, while the rest belonged to a small number of absentee landlords.<ref name="womenjournal" />
==== Gender disparities ====
During the same era, there was a shift in labor relations from the traditional [[sharecropping]] contracts, which were prevalent throughout most of the Persian plateau, to wage labor.<ref name="womenjournal" /> For pistachio cultivation, the new labor force was differentiated by skill and gender and was exclusively on a wage basis.<ref name="womenjournal" /> The laborers, called “ghararis”, who were by definition male and highly skilled in irrigation work, which was an exclusively male task, constituted the "labor aristocracy."<ref name="womenjournal" /> They were employed on a permanent basis with a monthly wage, a New Year bonus, and given a small plot of land free of charge with access to the landlord's irrigation water.<ref name="womenjournal" />

On the other hand, female laborers engaged in harvest and post-harvest operations occupied the lowest position in the labor hierarchy.<ref name="womenjournal" /> Their work was seasonal, and their labor remuneration was mostly based on a piece-rate basis, with payment made three to four months after finishing the work.<ref name="womenjournal" /> Additionally, the spinning and weaving of cotton textiles, which used to be a traditional income-earning activity for women, had at the time been virtually wiped out due to competition with the cheap [[Synthetic fiber|synthetic fibers]].<ref name="womenjournal" />
