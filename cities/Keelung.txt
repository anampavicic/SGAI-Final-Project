'''Keelung''' ({{IPAc-en|k|iː|ˈ|l|ʊ|ŋ}} {{respell|kee|LUUNG}};<ref name="pron">{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Jilong}}</ref> [[Hokkien]]: Ke-lâng), '''Chilung''' or '''Jilong''' ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|iː|ˈ|l|ʊ|ŋ}} {{respell|jee|LUUNG}};<ref name="pron"/> {{zh|p=Jīlóng}}), officially known as '''Keelung City''', is a major port [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|city]] situated in the northeastern part of [[Taiwan]]. The city is part of the [[Taipei–Keelung metropolitan area]] with neighboring [[New Taipei City]] and [[Taipei]]. Nicknamed the ''Rainy Port'' for its frequent rain and maritime role, the city is Taiwan's second largest [[seaport]] (after [[Kaohsiung]]), and was the world's 7th largest port in 1984.

In 1626, the Spanish established Fort San Salvador at present-day Keelung, an area inhabited by [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples]]. Control of the area eventually passed to the [[Qing dynasty]]. Fighting between China and Europeans around Keelung occurred in the 19th century during the [[First Opium War]] and the [[Sino-French War]]. The island of Taiwan was ceded to the [[Empire of Japan]] in 1895 after the [[First Sino-Japanese War]]; under [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] the city was called '''Kirun'''. Keelung became part of [[Taiwan Province]] under the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] after 1945. Administratively, the city became directly administered by the [[Executive Yuan]] in 1998 while the provincial government was ''de facto'' dissolved in 2018.

According to early Chinese accounts, this northern coastal area was originally called ''Pak-kang'' ({{zh|t=北港|poj=Pak-káng}}).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=William |author-link=William Campbell (missionary) |title=Formosa under the Dutch: described from contemporary records, with explanatory notes and a bibliography of the island |year=1903 |publisher=Kegan Paul |location=London |oclc=644323041 |chapter=Explanatory Notes |chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/formosaunderdut01campgoog#page/n554/mode/2up |pages=538–557|isbn=9789576380839 }}</ref> By the early 20th century, the city was known to the Western world as '''Kelung''',<ref>for example: {{cite book |last=Smith |first=D.

Davidson]] related that "Kelung" was among the few well-known names, thus warranting no alternate [[Romanization of Japanese|Japanese romanization]].{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=iii}}

However, the Taiwanese people have long called the city ''Kelang'' ({{zh|poj=Ke-lâng/Koe-lâng|t=雞籠|l=“rooster cage", "hencoop” or “chicken coop”}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.klcg.gov.tw/en/01/01_2.jsp |title=Welcome to Keelung City: The Beginning |publisher=Keelung City Government |access-date=24 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926220102/http://www.klcg.gov.tw/en/01/01_2.jsp |archive-date=26 September 2009 }}</ref>). While it has been proposed that this name was derived from the local mountain that took the shape of a rooster cage, it is more likely that the name was derived from the first inhabitants of the region, as are the names of many other Taiwanese cities. In this case, the [[Ketagalan people]] were the first inhabitants, and early [[Han Chinese|Han]] settlers probably approximated "Ketagalan" with ''Ke-lâng'' ([[Ketagalan language|Ketagalan]]: [[wikt:ke- -an|ke-]], "domain marker prefix" + [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]] [[Hokkien]] {{zh|poj=lâng|t=儂 / 人|l=person}}), the noun root being replaced with the common [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] term for people, while the domain marker [[circumfix]] "[[wikt:ke- -an|ke- -an]]" being reduced to just the [[prefix]].

In 1875, during the late [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Qing era]], a new official name was given ({{zh|c=基隆|p=Jīlóng|l=base prosperous}}).<ref name="KCG-Qing">{{cite web|url=http://www.klcg.gov.tw/en/01/01_2_3.jsp |title=Ching Dynasty |publisher=Keelung City Government |access-date=24 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526162424/http://www.klcg.gov.tw/en/01/01_2_3.jsp |archive-date=26 May 2010 }}</ref> In [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], probably the working language of Chinese government at the time, both the old and new names were likely pronounced ''Gīlóng'' (hence "Keelung").

Under [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] (1895–1945), the city was also known to the west by the Japanese romanization '''Kīrun''' (also written as ''Kiirun''<ref>{{cite book |last=Terry |first=Thomas Philip |title=Terry's Japanese Empire |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |year=1914 |url=https://archive.org/stream/terrysjapaneseem00terr#page/774/mode/2up |page=774 |oclc=51414323 |ol=18847607M |access-date=5 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315010556/https://archive.org/stream/terrysjapaneseem00terr#page/774/mode/2up |archive-date=15 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>).

In [[Taiwanese Hokkien]], the native language of the area, the city is called ''Ke-lâng''. In [[Hanyu Pinyin]], a system created for [[Mandarin Chinese]] in [[Mainland China]], the name of Keelung is written as ''Jīlóng'' (the shift from initial ''K'' to ''J'' is a recent development in the Beijing dialect, see [[Old Mandarin]]).<ref>{{R:nan:tdj|n=35577|poj=koe-lâng|hj=基隆|v=1|p=466}}</ref><ref>{{holodict|35351|e=基隆市}}</ref>

Keelung was first inhabited by the [[Ketagalan people|Ketagalan]], a tribe of [[Taiwanese aborigine]]. The [[Spanish expedition to Formosa]] in the early 17th century was its first contact with the West; by 1624 the Spanish had built [[:es:San Salvador de Quelung|San Salvador de Quelung]], a fort in Keelung serving as an outpost of the [[Manila]]-based [[Spanish East Indies]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Altares|first1=Guillermo|title=Una excavación aporta una nueva visión de la colonización de Asia|url=http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2016/11/12/actualidad/1478959382_298788.html|access-date=13 November 2016|language=es|newspaper=El País|date=12 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113175618/http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2016/11/12/actualidad/1478959382_298788.html|archive-date=13 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] ruled it as a part of [[Spanish Formosa]].

When [[Ming dynasty]] loyalist [[Koxinga]] successfully attacked the Dutch in southern Taiwan 
([[Siege of Fort Zeelandia]]), the crew of the Keelung forts fled to the Dutch trading post in Japan. The Dutch came back in 1663 and re-occupied and strengthened their earlier forts. However, trade with Qing China through Keelung was not what they hoped it would be and, in 1668, they left after getting harassed by aboriginals.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shepherd |first=John Robert |title=Statecraft and political economy on the Taiwan frontier, 1600-1800 |date=1993 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=9780804720663 |url={{GBurl|g3oWoSKVnVIC|page=95}} |page=95}}</ref>

====First Opium War====
{{main|First Opium War|Nerbudda incident}}

During the [[First Opium War]], the British [[merchant ship]] ''Nerbudda'' shipwrecked near the [[port of Keelung]] due to a typhoon in September 1841. Several months later, another British merchantman, the [[brig]] ''Ann'', also shipwrecked near Keelung on March 1842. Hundreds of survivors from both ships were captured by Chinese authorities and transferred to [[Tainan|Taiwan]]. Two senior Chinese officials, Dahonga and Yao Ying, filed a false report to the [[Daoguang Emperor]], claiming to have beaten off a British attack against Keelung. In October 1841, the [[Royal Navy]] sloop [[HMS Nimrod (1828)|HMS ''Nimrod'']] sailed to Keelung to search for survivors of ''Nerbudda'', but after they found out the Chinese sent them south for imprisonment, ''Nimrod'' bombarded the city's port, destroying 27 cannon before returning to [[British Hong Kong]]. Most of the survivors—over 130 from the ''Nerbudda'' and 54 from the ''Ann''—were [[Nerbudda incident|summarily executed]] by the Chinese in August 1842.<ref name="Tsai2014">{{cite book|author=Shih-Shan Henry Tsai|title=Maritime Taiwan: Historical Encounters with the East and the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUbfBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA66|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-46517-1|pages=66–67|access-date=6 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509194720/https://books.google.com/books?id=vUbfBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA66|archive-date=9 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Gordon2009">{{cite book|author=Leonard H.

In 1863, the Qing Empire opened up Keelung as a trading port and the city enjoyed rapid development due to the abundant commodities such as placer gold and high quality coal found in the drainage area of [[Keelung River]]. In 1875, [[Taipeh Prefecture]] was created and included Keelung. In 1878, Keelung was formed into a ''ting'' or sub-prefecture.{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=211}} Around the same time, the name was changed from ''Ke-lang'' ({{zh|t=雞籠廳|labels=no}}) to ''Kilong'' ({{zh|c=基隆廳|labels=no}}), which means "rich and prosperous land".<ref name=KCG-Qing />

The city suffered serious damage and lost hundreds of inhabitants during an [[1867 Keelung earthquake|earthquake and tsunami in 1867]]. The earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 7.0 and was caused by movement on a nearby [[Fault (geology)|fault]].<ref name="Cheng16">{{cite journal |last1=Cheng |first1=Shih-Nan |last2=Shaw |first2=Chen-Fang |last3=Yeh |first3=Yeong Tein |title=Reconstructing the 1867 Keelung Earthquake and Tsunami Based on Historical Documents |journal=Terrestrial, Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences |date=2016 |volume=27 |issue=3 |page=431 |doi=10.3319/TAO.2016.03.18.01(TEM) |bibcode=2016TAOS...27..431C |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305741212|doi-access=free }}</ref>

====Sino-French War====
{{main|Sino-French War|Keelung Campaign}}
[[File:Landing of French forces at Keelung.jpg|thumb|left|French forces landed at Keelung on 1 October 1884.]]
During the Sino-French War (1884–85), the French attempted an invasion of Taiwan during the Keelung Campaign. [[Liu Mingchuan]], who led the defence of Taiwan, recruited Aboriginals to serve alongside the Chinese soldiers in fighting against the French of [[Colonel]] [[Jacques Duchesne]]'s Formosa Expeditionary Corps. The French were defeated at the [[Battle of Tamsui]] and the Qing forces pinned the French down at Keelung in an eight-month-long campaign before the French withdrew.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2001/11/15/111666 | title=Exhuming French history in Taiwan - Taipei Times | date=15 November 2001 }}</ref>{{needs verification|date=August 2024}}

===Empire of Japan===
A systematic city development started during the Japanese Era, after the 1895 [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]], which handed all Taiwan over to Japan. A five-phase construction of Keelung Harbor was initiated, and in by 1916 trade volume had exceeded even those of Tamsui and Kaohsiung Harbors to become one of the major commercial harbors of Taiwan.<ref name="KCG-JR">{{cite web|url=http://www.klcg.gov.tw/en/01/01_2_4.jsp |title=Japanese Occupation |publisher=Keelung City Government |access-date=12 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524093925/http://www.klcg.gov.tw/en/01/01_2_4.jsp |archive-date=24 May 2010 }}</ref>

Keelung was governed as {{nihongo|Kīrun town|基隆街}}, Kīrun District, [[Taihoku Prefecture]] in 1920 and was upgraded to a city in 1924.<ref name="KCG-JR" /> The [[Pacific War]] broke out in 1941, and Keelung became one of the first targets of Allied bombers and was nearly destroyed as a result.<ref name="KCG-JR" /><ref>{{cite news |title=Taiwan in Time: When US bombs rained down on Keelung |url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2024/06/16/2003819410 |access-date=16 June 2024 |work=Taipei Times |date=16 June 2024}}</ref>

===Republic of China===
After the [[Retrocession Day|handover of Taiwan from Japan]] to the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in October 1945, Keelung was established as a [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|provincial city]] of [[Taiwan Province]]. The [[Keelung City Government]] worked with the harbor bureau to rebuild the city and the harbor and by 1984, the harbor became the 7th largest container harbor in the world.<ref name=KCG-ROC /> The city became directly governed by the [[Executive Yuan]] after Taiwan Province was streamlined in 1998 and became a ''de facto'' first level division in 2018 following the dissolution of the [[Taiwan Provincial Government]].

===Climate===
Keelung has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa'') with a yearly rainfall average upwards of {{convert|3700|mm|0}}. It has long been noted as one of the wettest and gloomiest cities in the world; the effect is related to the [[Kuroshio Current]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Davidson |first1=James W. |author-link=James W.

However its location on northern mountain slopes means that due to [[orographic lift]], rainfall is heavier during fall and winter, the latter during which a northeasterly flow prevails. During summer, southwesterly winds dominate and thus there is a slight [[rain shadow effect]]. Fog is most serious during winter and spring, when relative humidity levels are also highest.
