'''Jinju''' ({{Korean|hangul=진주}}; {{IPA|ko|tɕin.dʑu}}) is a [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|city]] in [[South Gyeongsang Province]], [[South Korea]]. It was the location of the [[Siege of Jinju (1592)|first (1592)]] and [[Siege of Jinju (1593)|second (1593)]] Sieges of Jinju by Japanese forces during the [[Imjin War]].  The [[Republic of Korea Air Force Education and Training Command]] is located in the eastern part of the city.
There are cultural-historical tourist attractions in Jinju such as [[Jinju Fortress]], the [[Jinju National Museum]], and the [[Daepyeong|Nam-gang Prehistoric Site Museum]].

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2023}}

Jinju was an ancient city of Goryeonggaya in the Gaya Era. This city was called 'Geoyeolseong' of Baekje during the Three Kingdom Era, and was called 'Geoyeolju', 'Cheongju', and 'Gangju' during the Unified Silla Era. Name of this city was changed into 'Jinju' for the first time in 940, the 23rd year of King [[Taejo of Goryeo|Taejo of the Goryeo Dynasty]]. It became 'Jinju-mok', one of 12 moks (local administrative units in Goryeo and Joseon Dynasty) in the 2nd year of King Seongjong (983). 

The [[Siege of Jinju (1593)|second siege of Jinju]] during the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|Japanese invasion of Korea]] ended in the massacre of the entire garrison and a substantial portion of the population. Korean accounts mention that the death toll at Jinju was 60,000. According to Japanese accounts, they had sent 20,000 heads back to Japan after their victory.<ref>{{citation|last=Turnbull|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Turnbull (historian)|year=2002|title=Samurai Invasion: Japan's Korean War 1592–98|publisher=Cassell & Co|isbn=0-304-35948-3|page=71|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/samuraiinvasionj0000turn}}</ref>

In the 33rd year of King Gojong of the Joseon Dynasty (1896), administrative district of the nation was reorganized with 13 provinces. At that time Jinju began to belong to Gyeongsangnam-do, and became capital town of Gyeongsangnam-do. And provincial governor started to reside in Jinju. On April 1, 1925, Busan replaced Jinju as provincial capital.

On August 15, 1948, the government of the Republic of Korea was established and 'the local self-government system' was started. At that time, Jinju-bu was raised to Jinju-si (city) and started to have mayor of the city. On January 1, 1995, in accordance with 'the Law pertaining to the establishment of Urban-Rural Integrated City', Jinju-si and Jinyang-gun became extinct and were merged into one integrated Jinju-si (city).

==Culture and festivals==
There are cultural events held in Jinju every year. Among these are the Jinju Namgang Lantern Festival which is held in October for approximately ten days. This nationally designated cultural tourism festival, found only in Jinju, features a spectacle of lanterns floating on the Nam River to commemorate the patriotic spirit of the 70,000 militia corps and government troops who died for their country defending Jinju from the Japanese forces during the [[Imjin War]] (1592–1598).  Other major festivals include: the [[Nongae]] Festival, the Korea Drama Festival, the Gaecheon Arts Festival and the Jinju National Bullfighting Contest.

The Nongae Festival,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miakaradeb.blogspot.com/2008/05/nongae-festival.html|title=miakara moments: Nongae Festival 2008|last=Miakara|date=28 May 2008}}</ref> held in May each year commemorates and celebrates the sacrifice of the patriotic [[gisaeng]] (professional Korean entertainer) [[Nongae]]'s suicide-assassination of a Japanese general together with the 70,000 Koreans who lost their lives in the battle of Jinju Castle during the [[Imjin War]].  The festival features an emotional reenactment of Nongae's suicidal drowning of a Japanese general from ''uiam bawi'' (righteous rock) below Chokseongnu (Jinju castle pavilion) on the banks of the Nam River.

Gaecheon Arts Festival is annually held from October 3 to 10 and the entire city turns to the streets for celebration at Korea's first provincial culture art festival, which awakens the artistic spirit of the Korean people.  The festival falls around [[Gaecheonjeol]] (National Foundation Day) and is widely regarded as one of Korea's finest.

The Jinju National Bullfighting Contest is recognized as Korea's oldest bullfighting event and spectators can witness a test of strength at this bullfighting contest held at a purpose-built traditional Korean sports arena near Jinyang lake.

The [[2023 Asian Weightlifting Championships]] was held in Jinju.

==Population==
At just over a third of a million, Jinju is a relatively small city by Korean standards. The annual growth of the population is 0.4% since 1995. People between the ages of 20 and 29 represent 17.5% of the city's total population, and justify the city's long-standing reputation as an educational city. The senior population (65 years or older), representing 7.6% of the city's total population, is higher than the provincial average (6.8%).<ref>[http://english.jinju.go.kr/eng/02/2_2_2.php?open_main=2&open_sub=2&open_sub2=2 Home > Introduction > Status > Population<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20070802001140/http://english.jinju.go.kr/eng/02/2_2_2.php?open_main=2&open_sub=2&open_sub2=2 |date=2007-08-02 }}</ref>

==Local personality==
Gang Se-hwang (son of Kang Hyeon), a high ranking government official and representative painter, calligrapher and art critic, was born here in 1713.

==Jinju cuisine==
{{Needs more references|section|date=August 2024}}[[File:Korean cuisine-Jinju bibimbap-01.jpg|thumb|''Jinju bibimbap'']]
Jinju has a number of distinctive local delicacies which reflect the tastes of Jinju people. Perhaps most celebrated is Jinju [[bibimbap]], which distinguishes itself from the common Korean rice and vegetable dish by its use of ''[[yukhoe]]'', made with raw beef and generous amounts of sesame oil. Also famous is Namgang (Nam River) grilled eel ({{transliteration|ko|minmul jangeo}}), which is caught locally and served in any one of the numerous restaurants overlooking the Nam River. Enjoying their food spicy, Jinjuites have also perfected a spicey pepper (''ttaengcho'') version of the popular Korean side dish ''[[pajeon]]'' (scallion pancake) known by its colloquial name [[jijimi]]. This is best enjoyed with a bowl of local rice wine [[makkeolli]].

[[Cheonhwang Sikdang]], founded here in 1927, is the oldest active restaurant in South Korea. <ref name=":0">{{Cite web |date=2004-04-22 |title=진주 맛집 - 선비의 고장 `맛`도 있더이다 |url=http://www.kookje.co.kr/news2011/asp/newsbody.asp?code=1600&key=20040423.22030160640 |access-date=2024-08-09 |website={{ill|Kookje Sinmun|ko|국제신문}}}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web |date=2006-06-30 |title=金順慶의 별미 여행 (36) - 비빔밥의 본향 晋州 |url=http://monthly.chosun.com/client/news/viw.asp?ctcd=&nNewsNumb=200607100082 |access-date=2024-08-09 |website=[[Monthly Chosun]] |language=ko}}</ref>

==Silk industry==
Since ancient days, silk processed in Jinju has been known for its superior quality, which is a result of the combination of natural resources (such as clean water of Mt. Jirisan and so on) and human resources. Silk factories in Jinju annually produce around 70% of the nation's  production{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}. Jinju silk has a soft, refined feeling and elegant colors because of superior dyeing techniques.

==Education==
Jinju is an educational city and home to [[Gyeongsang National University]] and [[Chinju National University of Education]], [[Gyeongnam National University of Science and Technology]]. It is also home to [[International University of Korea]], catering mostly to foreign students. It also has a number of community colleges that serve the local area.  Jinju's high schools offer high quality education and have a wide catchment area, reaching beyond the city limits to attract students from surrounding towns such as [[Sacheon]], [[Hadong]], and [[Sancheong]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}
