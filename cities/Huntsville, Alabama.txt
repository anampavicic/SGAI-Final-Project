Huntsville was founded within the [[Mississippi Territory]] in 1805 and became an incorporated town in 1811. When Alabama was admitted as a state in 1819, Huntsville was designated for a year as the first capital, before the state capitol was moved to more central settlements. The city developed across nearby hills north of the [[Tennessee River]], adding textile mills in the late nineteenth century.

Major growth in Huntsville took place in the decades following World War II. During the war, the [[United States Army|U.S Army]] established [[Redstone Arsenal]] in the vicinity, with a chemical weapons plant and related facilities. After the war, additional research was conducted at Redstone Arsenal on [[rocket]]s, followed by adaptations for space exploration. NASA's [[Marshall Space Flight Center]], the [[United States Army Aviation and Missile Command]], and most recently the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI's]] operational support headquarters, all were sited at Redstone Arsenal.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Strategic Realignment: Huntsville|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about/strategic-realignment-huntsville|access-date=October 17, 2021|website=Federal Bureau of Investigation|language=en-us}}</ref>

===Early history===
Due to settlement pressures after the United States gained independence, this area had become largely empty of indigenous peoples by the turn of the 19th century. An Indian trader and boatman named Ditto established himself at a landing on the river prior to American settlement.<ref>Edward Chambers Betts. (1909).

===Emerging industries===
Huntsville's initial growth was based on wealth generated by the sale of [[cotton]] from [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|plantations]], for which there was international demand, and trade associated with [[railroad]] industries. Many wealthy planters moved into the area from [[Virginia]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[the Carolinas]] to develop new cotton plantations.<ref name=":10">{{Cite journal |last=Snow |first=Whitney Adrienne |date=October 1, 2010 |title=Cotton Mill City: The Huntsville Textile Industry, 1880-1989 |url=https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?p=AONE&sw=w&issn=00024341&v=2.1&it=r&id=GALE%7CA241619803&sid=googleScholar&linkaccess=abs |journal=The Alabama Review |language=English |volume=63 |issue=4 |pages=243–282|doi=10.1353/ala.2010.0006 |s2cid=154931802}}</ref> The invention of the [[cotton gin]] in the late eighteenth century meant that uplands areas could be profitably cultivated with short-staple cotton, which could be grown in a much larger area than the long-staple cotton of the Sea Islands and Low Country.

In 1819, Huntsville hosted a constitutional convention in Walker Allen's large cabinet-making shop. The 44 delegates wrote a constitution for the new state of Alabama. In accordance with the new state constitution, Huntsville became Alabama's first capital when the state was admitted to the Union. This was a temporary designation for one legislative session only. The capital was moved to more central cities in the state; to [[Cahaba, Alabama|Cahaba]], then to [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]], and finally to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ahc.alabama.gov/AlabamaStateCapitolHistoryFacts.aspx |title=History of the Alabama State Capitol |work=Alabama Historical Commission |access-date=October 7, 2019}}</ref>

In 1855, the [[Memphis and Charleston Railroad]] was constructed through Huntsville, becoming the first railway to link the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic seacoast]] with the lower [[Mississippi River]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Harper's Encyclopædia of United States History from 458 A.D. to 1905: Based Upon the Plan of Benson John Lossing ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LotMAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA526 |year=1906 |publisher=Harper & brothers |page=526}}</ref>

On the morning of April 11, 1862, Union troops led by General Ormsby M. Mitchel seized Huntsville in order to sever the Confederacy's rail communications and gain access to the [[Memphis & Charleston Railroad]]. Huntsville was the headquarters for the Eastern Division of the Memphis & Charleston.<ref>{{cite book|title=Alabama Railroads|last=Cline|first=Wayne|publisher=The University of Alabama Press|year=1997|location=Tuscaloosa|page=4}}</ref>

During the first occupation, Union officers took over many of the larger homes in the city while the enlisted soldiers camped in tents mainly on the outskirts. Union troops searched for Confederate troops hiding in the town and weapons. There was not much resistance, and they treated Huntsville residents in a relatively civil manner.

===After the Civil War===

During the [[Reconstruction era]], three delegates from Huntsville attended the 1867 Constitutional Convention including [[Andrew J. Applegate]], originally from Ohio, who went on to serve as Alabama's first Lieutenant Governor.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Attendance Records of the state Constitutional Convention, 1867–1868 |url=https://edu.lva.virginia.gov/dbva/items/show/258 |access-date=December 18, 2022 |website=Document Bank of Virginia}}</ref> Councill Training School, which eventually became [[William Hooper Councill High School]], was established as the first public school for African American students. It was named for educator and school founder [[William Hooper Councill]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=William Hooper Councill High School Site |url=https://www.huntsvilleal.gov/historicmarkers/william-hooper-councill-high-school-site/ |access-date=December 18, 2022 |website=City of Huntsville |language=en-US}}</ref>

Huntsville became a center for cotton [[textile mill]]s, such as Lincoln, [[Dallas Mill|Dallas]], and Merrimack. Each mill company constructed worker housing outside the city, creating communities that eventually included schools, churches, grocery stores, theaters, and hardware stores, all within walking distance of the mill. In many such company towns, workers were required to buy goods at the company stores, which sometimes overcharged them. The mill owners also established rules for behavior and could throw out workers from housing if they violated these policies. As was common for the time, work was highly segregated with only whites being allowed to work inside the mills and Blacks relegated to working outside as laborers and groundskeepers.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Snow |first=Whitney Adrienne |date=2010 |title=Cotton Mill City: The Huntsville Textile Industry, 1880–1989 |url=https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?p=AONE&id=GALE{{!}}A241619803&v=2.1&it=r&sid=AONE&asid=b6a8a1e4 |journal=Alabama Review |language=en |volume=63 |issue=4 |pages=243–281 |doi=10.1353/ala.2010.0006 |s2cid=154931802 |issn=2166-9961}}</ref>

During the 1930s, industry declined in Huntsville due to the [[Great Depression]]. Huntsville became known as the [[Watercress]] Capital of the World because of its abundant harvest in the area. Madison County led Alabama in cotton production during this time.<ref name="MSFC">{{cite web |title=NASA MSFC Notes on the History of Huntsville |url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/huntsville/hsv_history.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527092424/http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/huntsville/hsv_history.html |archive-date=May 27, 2010 |access-date=November 8, 2011 |publisher=History.msfc.nasa.gov}}</ref>

===Military and NASA involvement===
By 1940, Huntsville was still relatively small, with a population of about 13,000 inhabitants. This quickly changed in early 1941 when the [[U.S. Army]] selected {{convert|35000|acre|km2}} of land adjoining the southwest area of the city for building three [[chemical munitions]] facilities: the [[Huntsville Arsenal]], the Redstone Ordnance Plant (soon redesignated Redstone Arsenal), and the Gulf Chemical Warfare Depot. These operated throughout [[World War II]], with combined personnel approaching 20,000. Resources in the area were strained as new workers flocked to the area, and the construction of housing could not keep up.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book |last=Baker |first=Michael E. |title=Redstone Arsenal: yesterday and today |publisher=[[U.S. Army Missile Command]] |year=1993 |location=Redstone Arsenal, Alabama}}</ref>

At the end of the war in 1945, the munitions facilities were no longer needed. They were combined with the designation Redstone Arsenal (RSA), and a considerable political and business effort was made in attempts to attract new tenants. One significant start involved manufacturing the [[Keller (automobile)|Keller automobile]], but this closed after 18 vehicles were built. With the encouragement of US Senator [[John Sparkman]] (D-AL), the [[U.S. Army Air Force]] considered this for a major testing facility, but selected another site. Redstone Arsenal was prepared for disposal, but Sparkman used his considerable Southern Democratic influence (the [[Solid South]] controlled numerous powerful chairmanships of congressional committees) to persuade the Army to choose it as a site for rocket and missile development.<ref name=":3" />

As the [[Korean War]] started, the Ordnance Guided Missile Center (OGMC) was given the mission to develop what eventually became the [[PGM-11 Redstone|Redstone Rocket]]. This rocket set the stage for the [[United States' space program]], as well as major Army missile programs, to be centered in Huntsville. Brigadier General [[Holger Toftoy]] commanded OGMC and the overall Redstone Arsenal. In early 1956, the [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] (ABMA) under Major General [[John Bruce Medaris|John Medaris]] was formed.<ref name=":3" />

In 1950, about 1,000 personnel were transferred from [[Fort Bliss]], Texas, to Redstone Arsenal to form the Ordnance Guided Missile Center (OGMC). Central to this was a group of about 200 German scientists and engineers, led by [[Wernher von Braun]]; they had been brought from [[Nazi Germany]] to the United States by Colonel Holger Toftoy under [[Operation Paperclip]] following World War II. Assigned to the center at Huntsville, they settled and raised families.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Laney |first=Monique |title=German Rocketeers in the Heart of Dixie: Making Sense of the Nazi Past During the Civil Rights Era |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-300-21345-4 |location=[[New Haven, Connecticut]] |language=en |oclc=910553920}}</ref>

On July 1, 1960, 4,670 civilian employees, associated buildings and equipment, and {{convert|1840|acre|km2}} of land were transferred from ABMA to form [[NASA]]'s [[George C. Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC). Wernher von Braun was MSFC's initial director. On September 8, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] formally dedicated the MSFC.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book |last1=Dunar |first1=Andrew J. |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4313.pdf |title=Power to Explore: A History of Marshall Space Flight Center 1960-1990 |last2=Waring |first2=Stephen P. |publisher=[[NASA]] |year=1999 |location=Washington, D.C. |language=en}}</ref>

During the 1960s, the major mission of MSFC was in developing the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn boosters]] used by NASA in the [[Apollo program|Apollo Lunar Landing Program]]. For this, MSFC greatly increased its employees, and many new companies joined the Huntsville industrial community. The [[Cummings Research Park]] was developed just north of Redstone Arsenal to partially accommodate this industrial growth, and has now become the second-largest research park of this type in America.<ref name=":4" />

Huntsville was selected as the permanent home of the United States [[Space Operations Command]] in 2020, but in 2023 the Pentagon announced that the temporary headquarters would be expanded and remain in Colorado.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/05/us/politics/huntsville-space-command-colorado-springs.html|title=The Loss of Space Command Headquarters Brings an Alabama City Down to Earth |newspaper = The New York Times |date=August 5, 2023 |access-date= August 5, 2023}}</ref>

===Civil Rights Movement to modern day===
Huntsville was a key location in the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]]. In 1962, students from [[Alabama A&M University]] held the city's first lunch counter [[Sit-in movement|sit-in]].{{Sfn|Fisk|2019|p=66}} After the mayor refused to address the protests, the Community Service Committee (CSC) was formed to help organize sit-ins and protests, as well as [[Bail|bail out]] arrested protestors.{{Sfn|Fisk|2019|p=67}}<ref name=":6">{{Cite web |last=Robinson |first=Kerry |date=April 14, 2014 |title=Blacks in Huntsville, Alabama, sit in and win racial desegregation at lunch counters, 1962 |url=https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/blacks-huntsville-alabama-sit-and-win-racial-desegregation-lunch-counters-1962 |access-date=May 23, 2023 |website=Global Nonviolent Action Database}}</ref> In April 1962, a committee was formed by the city to "address the concerns of the African American community,"{{Sfn|Fisk|2019|p=77}} and eight lunch counters, as well as a number of other public spaces, were desegregated.{{Sfn|Fisk|2019|p=77}}<ref name=":6" /> On May 11, 1962, Huntsville became the first city in Alabama to be racially integrated.<ref name=":6" />

In June 1963, the admission of two Black students to the University of Alabama in Huntsville was challenged by [[Governor of Alabama|Governor]] [[George Wallace]]. Wallace pushed back the registration dates for multiple state universities (presumably to allow more time for [[state troopers]] to move into the area) but instead moved them to [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]]. The students were admitted without issues. Around the same time, the [[color barrier]] was broken further when the first white person enrolled at Alabama A&M University.{{Sfn|Fisk|2019|p=79–80}} In August 1963, a court ruling determined that Huntsville must desegregate their schools. Wallace used state troopers to stop four students from entering the first desegregated school. On September 6, the troopers announced that the desegregated schools were closed for three more days, but the Board of Education issued a statement denying the closure.{{Sfn|Fisk|2019|p=80–82}} When the schools opened on September 9, Wallace was served a restraining order against further interference with the desegregation of Huntsville schools.{{Sfn|Fisk|2019|p=85}} Huntsville became the first city in Alabama to desegregate its schools as well.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gray |first=Margo |date=January 18, 2011 |title=Blue jeans put Huntsville in civil rights movement |url=https://www.waff.com/story/13858582/blue-jeans-put-huntsville-in-civil-rights-movement |access-date=May 24, 2023 |website=[[WAFF (TV)|WAFF 48]] |language=en}}</ref>

Alabama's opposition to desegregation at this time caused concern from the NASA Administrator [[James E. Webb]], who investigated equal employment opportunities for Black people in Huntsville. After failing to attract high-level staff to Huntsville, Webb said that "some research work would have to be switched from Huntsville to New Orleans". This investigation into employment caused MSFC to open their engineering education programs to Black students at Alabama A&M and [[Oakwood College]], as well as for local contractors to "work for progress in race relations".{{Sfn|Fisk|2019|p=86–87}}<ref>{{Cite web |last=Neuman |first=Scott |date=July 22, 2019 |title=As NASA's Apollo Space Program Grew, Alabama Was Pressured To Desegregate |url=https://www.npr.org/2019/07/22/744023616/as-nasas-apollo-space-program-grew-alabama-was-pressured-to-desegregate |access-date=May 25, 2023 |website=[[NPR]]}}</ref>

Huntsville has the [[List of United States cities by population|29th]] largest land area in the United States, for cities with a population over 100,000.

Huntsville has borders surrounding both the cities of [[Madison, Alabama|Madison]] and [[Triana, Alabama|Triana]]. Huntsville also borders the cities of [[Decatur, Alabama|Decatur]], [[Athens, Alabama|Athens]], [[Owens Cross Roads, Alabama|Owens Cross Roads]], the town of [[Mooresville, Alabama|Mooresville]] as well as the [[census-designated place]]s of [[Moores Mill, Alabama|Moores Mill]], [[Meridianville, Alabama|Meridianville]], Laceys Spring, and [[Redstone Arsenal]].

Situated in the Tennessee River valley, Huntsville is partially surrounded by several [[plateau]]s and large hills. These plateaus are associated with the [[Cumberland Plateau]], and are locally called "mountains". [[Monte Sano Mountain]] (Spanish for "Mountain of Health") is the most notable and is east of the city, along with Round Top (Burritt), Chapman, Huntsville, and Green mountains.<ref>{{cite web |title=Monte Sano State Park |url=http://www.alapark.com/monte-sano-state-park |website=Alabama State Parks |publisher=Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources |access-date=April 11, 2016}}</ref> Others are Wade Mountain to the north, Rainbow Mountain to the west, and Weeden and Madkin mountains on the [[Redstone Arsenal]] property in the south.

===Climate===
Huntsville has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa''). It experiences hot, humid summers and generally mild winters, with average high temperatures ranging from near {{convert|90|°F|1|abbr=on}} in the summer to {{convert|49|°F|1|abbr=on}} during winter.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web |title=Huntsville Climate: Narrative |url=https://www.weather.gov/hun/huntsvilleclimatenarrative |access-date=December 19, 2022 |website= weather.gov|publisher=National Weather Service |language=EN-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Climate |url=https://hsvchamber.org/about-us/hsvmadison-county/climate/ |access-date=December 19, 2022 |website=Huntsville/Madison County Chamber |language=en-US}}</ref>

Huntsville is near the center of a large area of the U.S. mid-South that has maximum precipitation in the winter and spring, not summer.  The average yearly precipitation is more than 54 inches. On average, the wettest single month is December, but Huntsville has a prolonged wetter season from November to May with, on average, nearly or over 5 or more inches of precipitation most of those months. On average, August to October represent slightly drier months (see climate chart, showing less than 3.6 inches of precipitation these months). Droughts can occur, primarily August through October, but usually there is enough rainfall to keep soils moist and vegetation lush. Much of Huntsville's precipitation is delivered by [[thunderstorm]]s.<ref name=":5" /> Thunderstorms are most frequent during the spring, and the most severe storms occur during the spring and late fall.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Madison County Tornadoes |url=https://w2.weather.gov/hun/madisontor |access-date=December 19, 2022 |website=weather.gov |language=EN-US |archive-date=December 19, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221219020010/https://w2.weather.gov/hun/madisontor }}</ref> These storms can deliver large [[hail]], damaging straight-line winds, and [[tornado]]es.

===Newspapers and magazines===
''[[The Huntsville Times]]'' has been Huntsville's only daily newspaper since 1996, when the ''Huntsville News'' closed. Before then, the ''News'' was the morning paper, and the ''Times'' was the afternoon paper until 2004. The ''Times'' has a weekday circulation of 60,000, which rises to 80,000 on Sundays. Both papers were owned by the [[Advance Publications|Newhouse chain]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Beyerle |first=Dana |date=October 15, 1990 |title=Times editor defends 'Alabama Bound' piece |pages=4–5 |work=The Huntsville Times |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VkoeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AMcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5812%2C1923481 |access-date=December 24, 2022}}</ref>

Huntsville has two active commercial rail lines. The mainline is run by [[Norfolk Southern]], which runs from [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The original depot for this rail line, the Huntsville Depot, still exists as a [[railroad museum]], though it no longer offers passenger service.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Huntsville, AL * |url=http://www.nscorp.com/content/nscorp/en.html |access-date=December 17, 2022 |website=Norfolk Southern}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Historic Huntsville Depot (public grounds open) |url=https://www.huntsville.org/listing/historic-huntsville-depot-(public-grounds-open)/55/ |access-date=December 17, 2022 |website= huntsville.org |language=en-us}}</ref>

Another rail line, formerly part of the [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad|Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&N)]], successor to the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway (NC&StL)]], is being operated by the [[Huntsville and Madison County Railroad Authority|Huntsville and Madison County Railroad Authority (HMCRA)]]. The line connects to the Norfolk Southern line downtown and runs {{convert|13|mi|km|0}} south, passing near Ditto Landing on the [[Tennessee River]], and terminating at Norton Switch, near Hobbs Island. This service, in continuous operation since 1894, presently hauls freight and provides [[transloading]] facilities at its downtown depot location. Until the mid-1950s, the L&N provided freight and passenger service to Guntersville. The rail cars were loaded onto barges at Hobbs Island. The barge tows were taken upstream through the Guntersville Dam & Locks and discharged at Port Guntersville. Remnants of the track supporting piers still remain in the river just upstream from Hobbs Island. The service ran twice daily. L&N abandoned the line in 1984, at which time it was acquired by the newly created HMCRA, a state agency.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Services |url=https://hmcrr.com/services/ |access-date=December 17, 2022 |website=Huntsville & Madison County Railroad Authority |language=en-US}}</ref>

A third line, the Mercury and Chase Railroad, runs {{convert|10|mi|km|adj=on}} weekend tourist rides on part of another former NC&StL and L&N line from the North Alabama Railroad Museum's Chase Depot, located in the community of [[Chase, Alabama]]. Their collection includes one of the oldest diesel locomotives in existence (1926). The rail line originally connected Huntsville to NC&StL's Nashville-to-Chattanooga mainline in [[Decherd, Tennessee]]. The depot was once the smallest [[union station]] in the United States when it served the NC&StL and Memphis and Charleston Railroad, the predecessor to the Norfolk Southern.<ref name=":1">{{cite web |title=Welcome To The North Alabama Railroad Museum |url=http://northalabamarailroadmuseum.com/wp/ |access-date=December 17, 2022 |website=North Alabama Railroad Museum |language=en-US |archive-date=December 17, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221217221620/http://northalabamarailroadmuseum.com/wp/ }}</ref>
