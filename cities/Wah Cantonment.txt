== History ==
Wah Cantt is located near the ancient city of [[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]], a small town enriched with one of the most important archaeological sites in the world and the “First University of the World”, located near Wah Cantt.<ref name=Wah2>[http://www.wahcantt.com/index.php/about-wahcantt History of Wah Cantt] Wahcantt.com website, Retrieved 25 September 2021</ref>

It is believed that the name 'Wah' originated in the [[Mughal era]]. The name was coined by [[Jahangir]], the Mughal emperor, while en route to [[Lahore]] after a visit to [[Kashmir]], while residing in Wah village, which was formerly known as 'Jalal Sar'. Emperor Jahangir's army was searching for a place to rest where there was water because they were tired. When he saw a spot with a fresh water source, he yelled, “Wah.” Subsequently, individuals began to refer to the area as 'Wah'.<ref name=Wah2/><ref name=Wah>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wahcantt.com/index.php/aboutwahcanttonment|title=About Wah Cantt - Fact File|website=Wahcantt.com website |access-date=25 September 2021}}</ref>

In 1849, the region was brought under [[British Empire|British]] rule and the British government decided to expand the Wah Cantonment which had turned into a British military camp. The Mughal invasion of this area had a significant impact on the architecture of the village and surrounding areas. You can still see it today in the [[Wah Gardens]]. Other notable locations include the Wah Ordnance Club and the POF hotel. The Pakistani Arms Manufacturing Company is a consortium of twenty manufacturing facilities that produce guns, armoured vehicles, and other weapons for the [[Pakistan Army]].<ref name=GS/><ref name=Wah/><ref name=Wah3>[http://www.wahcantt.com/index.php/geographical-location Wah Cantt location and history] Wahcantt.com website, Retrieved 25 September 2021</ref>
