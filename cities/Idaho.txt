'''Idaho''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Idaho.ogg|ˈ|aɪ|d|ə|h|oʊ}} {{Respell|EYE|də|hoh}}) is a landlocked [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[Mountain states|Mountain West]] subregions of the [[Western United States]]. It borders [[Montana]] and [[Wyoming]] to the east, [[Nevada]] and [[Utah]] to the south, and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]] to the west; it shares a small portion of the [[Canada–United States border]] to the north, with the province of [[British Columbia]]. The [[US state capitals|state's capital]] and largest city is [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]]. With an area of {{convert|83569|sqmi|km2|abbr=}}, Idaho is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|14th-largest]] state by land area. With a population of approximately 2.0 &nbsp;million, it ranks as the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|13th-least populous]] and the [[List of U.S. states by population density|seventh-least densely populated]] of the [[List of US states|50 U.S. states]].

For thousands of years, and prior to European colonization, Idaho had been inhabited by [[Native Americans in the United States|native peoples]]. In the early 19th century, Idaho was considered part of the [[Oregon Country]], an area of dispute between the U.S. and the [[British Empire]]. It officially became [[Territories of the United States|a U.S. territory]] with the signing of the [[Oregon Treaty|Oregon Treaty of 1846]], but a separate [[Idaho Territory]] was not organized until 1863, instead being included for periods in [[Oregon Territory]] and [[Washington Territory]]. Idaho was eventually [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]] on July 3, 1890, becoming the [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|43rd state]].

Forming part of the Pacific Northwest (and the associated [[Cascadia (bioregion)|Cascadia bioregion]]), Idaho is divided into several distinct geographic and climatic regions. The state's north, the relatively isolated [[Idaho Panhandle]], is closely linked with [[Eastern Washington]], with which it shares the [[Pacific Time Zone]]—the rest of the state uses the [[Mountain Time Zone]]. The state's south includes the [[Snake River Plain]] (which has most of the population and agricultural land), and the southeast incorporates part of the [[Great Basin]]. Idaho is quite mountainous and contains several stretches of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The [[United States Forest Service]] holds about 38% of Idaho's land, the highest proportion of any state.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110727120656/http://www.wildlandfire.com/docs/2007/western-states-data-public-land.htm "Western States Data Public Land Acreage"], ''wildlandfire.com''. Archived on July 27, 2011. Retrieved January 3, 2020.</ref>

Industries significant for the state economy include manufacturing, agriculture, mining, forestry, and tourism. Several science and technology firms are either headquartered in Idaho or have factories there, and the state also contains the [[Idaho National Laboratory]], which is the country's largest [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] facility. Idaho's agricultural sector supplies many products, but the state is best known for [[Idaho potato|its potato crop]], which comprises around one-third of the nationwide yield. The [[List of U.S. state nicknames|official state nickname]] is the "Gem State."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://digitalatlas.cose.isu.edu/geog/explore/essay.pdf |title= Origins of the Name "Idaho" and How Idaho Became a Territory in 1863 |last= Wells |first= Merle W |access-date= January 16, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190406151232/https://digitalatlas.cose.isu.edu/geog/explore/essay.pdf |archive-date= April 6, 2019 |url-status= live }}</ref>

The same year Congress created Colorado Territory, a county called [[Idaho County, Idaho|Idaho County]] was created in eastern [[Washington Territory]]. The county was named after a [[steamboat|steamship]] named ''Idaho'', which was launched on the [[Columbia River]] in 1860.

Humans may have been present in the Idaho area as long as 14,500 years ago. Excavations at [[Wilson Butte Cave]] near [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]] in 1959 revealed evidence of human activity, including arrowheads, that rank among the oldest dated artifacts in North America. [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] peoples predominant in the area included the [[Nez Perce people|Nez Percé]] in the north and the Northern and Western [[Shoshone]] in the south.<ref name = natgeo>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/2019/08/coopers-landing-idaho-site-americas-oldest/|title=15,000-year-old Idaho archaeology site now among America's oldest|date=August 29, 2019|website=Culture & History|access-date=September 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190905110333/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/2019/08/coopers-landing-idaho-site-americas-oldest/|archive-date=September 5, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>

A Late [[Upper Paleolithic]] site was identified at Cooper's Ferry in western Idaho near the town of [[Cottonwood, Idaho|Cottonwood]] by archaeologists in 2019. Based on evidence found at the site, first people lived in this area 15,300 to 16,600 years ago, predating the [[Beringia]] land bridge by about a thousand years. The discoverers emphasized that they possess similarities with tools and artifacts discovered in [[Japan]] that date from 16,000 to 13,000 years ago.<ref name = natgeo/><ref name = science>{{Cite journal|last1=G.

An early presence of French-Canadian trappers is visible in names and [[toponym]]s: ''Nez Percé, Cœur d'Alène, Boisé, Payette''. Some of these names appeared prior to the [[Lewis and Clark]] and [[Pacific Fur Company|Astorian]] expeditions, which included significant numbers of French and [[Métis]] guides recruited for their familiarity with the terrain.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

Idaho, as part of the [[Oregon Country]], was claimed by both the United States and Great Britain until the United States gained undisputed jurisdiction in 1846. From 1843 to 1859, present-day Idaho was under the de&nbsp;facto jurisdiction of the [[Provisional Government of Oregon]]. When Oregon became a state in 1859, what is now Idaho was situated in what remained of the original Oregon Territory, designated as the Washington Territory.

Between 1849 and the creation of the [[Idaho Territory]] in 1863, parts of present-day Idaho were included in the [[Oregon Territory|Oregon]], [[Washington Territory|Washington]], and [[Dakota Territory|Dakota]] Territories. The new Idaho territory included present-day Idaho, [[Montana]], and most of [[Wyoming]]. The Lewis and Clark expedition crossed Idaho in 1805 on the way to the Pacific, and in 1806, on the return trip, largely following the [[Clearwater River (Idaho)|Clearwater River]] in both directions. The first non-indigenous settlement was [[Kullyspell House]], established on the shore of [[Lake Pend Oreille]] in 1809 by [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] of the [[North West Company]] for fur trading.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northamericanforts.com/West/id.html#thompson |title=David Thompson's Trading Post |website=Idaho Forts |publisher=American Forts Network |access-date=December 7, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813155304/http://www.northamericanforts.com/West/id.html#thompson |archive-date=August 13, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Meinig |first=DW |author-link=D.W.

For example, at {{convert|2.3|e6acre|ha}}, the [[Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness Area]] is the largest contiguous area of protected wilderness in the continental United States. Idaho is a [[Rocky Mountains|Rocky Mountain]] state with abundant natural resources and scenic areas. The state has snow-capped mountain ranges, rapids, vast lakes and steep canyons. The waters of the [[Snake River]] run through [[Hells Canyon]], the deepest gorge in the United States. [[Shoshone Falls]] falls down cliffs from a height greater than [[Niagara Falls]].<ref>{{cite web |title=2015 Idaho Travel Guide by Visit Idaho - Issuu |url=https://issuu.com/visitidaho/docs/2015-travel-guide |website=issuu.com |date=February 13, 2015 |language=en}}</ref>

By far, the most important river in Idaho is the Snake River, a major tributary of the Columbia River. The Snake River flows from [[Yellowstone]] in northwestern [[Wyoming]] through the [[Snake River Plain]] in southern Idaho before turning north, leaving the state at [[Lewiston, Idaho|Lewiston]] before joining the Columbia in [[Kennewick]]. Other major rivers are the [[Clark Fork (river)|Clark Fork]]/[[Pend Oreille River]], the [[Spokane River]], and, many major tributaries of the Snake River, including the [[Clearwater River (Idaho)|Clearwater River]], the [[Salmon River (Idaho)|Salmon River]], the [[Boise River]], and the [[Payette River]]. The Salmon River empties into the Snake in Hells Canyon and forms the southern boundary of Nez Perce County on its north shore, of which Lewiston is the county seat. The Port of [[Lewiston, Idaho|Lewiston]], at the confluence of the [[Clearwater River (Idaho)|Clearwater]] and the Snake Rivers is the farthest inland [[seaport]] on the West Coast at 465&nbsp;[[river mile]]s from the Pacific at [[Astoria, Oregon]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2812.html |title=Port of Lewiston |publisher=US history |access-date=July 30, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622052243/http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2812.html |archive-date=June 22, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The vast majority of Idaho's population lives in the Snake River Plain, a valley running from across the entirety of southern Idaho from east to west. The valley contains the major cities of [[Boise]], [[Meridian, Idaho|Meridian]], [[Nampa, Idaho|Nampa]], [[Caldwell, Idaho|Caldwell]], [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]], [[Idaho Falls]], and [[Pocatello]]. The plain served as an easy pass through the Rocky Mountains for westward-bound settlers on the [[Oregon Trail]], and many settlers chose to settle the area rather than risking the treacherous route through the [[Blue Mountains (Pacific Northwest)|Blue Mountains]] and the [[Cascade Range]] to the west. The western region of the plain is known as the [[Treasure Valley]], bound between the [[Owyhee Mountains]] to the southwest and the [[Boise Mountains]] to the northeast. The central region of the Snake River Plain is known as the [[Magic Valley]].

Idaho's highest point is [[Borah Peak]], {{convert|12662|ft|0|abbr=on}}, in the [[Lost River Range]] north of [[Mackay, Idaho|Mackay]]. Idaho's lowest point, {{convert|710|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, is in [[Lewiston, Idaho|Lewiston]], where the [[Clearwater River (Idaho)|Clearwater River]] joins the [[Snake River]] and continues into Washington. The [[Sawtooth Range (Idaho)|Sawtooth Range]] is often considered Idaho's most famous mountain range.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.idahoaclimbingguide.com/id27.htm |title= Sawtooth Range |publisher= Idaho climbing guide |access-date= July 30, 2010 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110615075042/http://www.idahoaclimbingguide.com/id27.htm |archive-date= June 15, 2011}}</ref> Other mountain ranges in Idaho include the [[Bitterroot Range]], the [[White Cloud Mountains]], the [[Lost River Range]], the [[Clearwater Mountains]], and the [[Salmon River Mountains]].

[[Salmon-Challis National Forest]] is located in the east central sections of the state, with Salmon National Forest to the north and Challis National Forest to the south. The forest is in an area known as the Idaho Cobalt Belt, which consists of a {{convert|34|mile|km|adj=}} long [[geological formation]] of [[sedimentary rock]] that contains some of the largest [[cobalt]] deposits in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |title=Idaho Is Sitting on One of the Most Important Elements on Earth |author=Michael Holtz |date=24 Jan 2022 |website=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/01/cobalt-clean-energy-climate-change-idaho/621321/}}</ref>

Idaho has two [[Time in the United States|time zones]], with the dividing line approximately midway between Canada and [[Nevada]]. Southern Idaho, including the [[Boise metropolitan area]], [[Idaho Falls, Idaho|Idaho Falls]], [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]], and [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]], are in the [[Mountain Time Zone]].

===Climate===

Idaho's [[climate]] varies widely. Although the state's western border is about {{convert|330|mi|-1}} from the Pacific Ocean, the maritime influence is still felt in Idaho; especially, in the winter when cloud cover, [[humidity]], and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] are at their maximum extent. This influence has a moderating effect in the winter where temperatures are not as low as would otherwise be expected for a northern state with predominantly high elevations.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/IDAHO.htm | title = Climate of Idaho | website = WRCC | publisher = DRI | date = February 20, 1954 | access-date = July 30, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110909133342/http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/IDAHO.htm | archive-date = September 9, 2011 | url-status = live }}</ref> In the panhandle, moist air masses from the coast are released as precipitation over the [[North Central Rockies forests]], creating the [[North American inland temperate rainforest]].<ref>{{cite web| last =Woodward| first = Susan L.| title = Inland Rainforests of the Northwest| publisher = Radford University| date= 2012–2015| url = https://php.radford.edu/~swoodwar/biomes/?page_id=2286| access-date = May 4, 2021}}</ref> The maritime influence is least prominent in the state's eastern part where the precipitation patterns are often reversed, with wetter summers and drier winters, and seasonal temperature differences are more extreme, showing a more semi-arid [[continental climate]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/IDAHO.htm|title=Climate of Idaho|website=Western Regional Climate Center|access-date=February 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171120183856/https://wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/IDAHO.htm|archive-date=November 20, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Idaho can be hot, although extended periods over {{convert|98|°F|°C|abbr=on}} are rare, except for the lowest point in elevation, [[Lewiston, Idaho|Lewiston]], which correspondingly sees little snow. Hot summer days are tempered by the low relative humidity and cooler evenings during summer months since, for most of the state, the highest [[Day|diurnal]] difference in temperature is often in the summer.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/IDAHO.htm |title= Climate of Idaho |website= WRCC—DRI |date= February 20, 1954 |access-date= January 23, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170221052600/http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/IDAHO.htm |archive-date= February 21, 2017 |url-status= live }}</ref> Winters can be cold, although extended periods of bitter cold weather below zero are unusual. Idaho's all-time highest temperature of {{convert|118|F|C}} was recorded at [[Orofino, Idaho|Orofino]] on July 28, 1934; the all-time lowest temperature of {{convert|-60|F|C}} was recorded at [[Island Park Dam]] on January 18, 1943.

The [[United States Census Bureau]] determined Idaho's population was 1,900,923 on July 1, 2021, a 21% increase since the [[2010 United States census|2010 U.S. census]].<ref name="PopEstUS">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/ID,adacountyidaho/PST045221|title=QuickFacts Idaho; UNITED STATES|website=2018 Population Estimates|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division|date=March 10, 2019|access-date=March 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190121064053/https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/id,US/PST045218|archive-date=January 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Idaho had an estimated population of 1,754,208 in 2018, which was an increase of 37,265, from the prior year and an increase of 186,626, or 11.91%, since 2010. This included a natural increase since the last census of 58,884 (111,131 births minus 52,247 deaths) and an increase due to net [[Human migration|migration]] of 75,795 people into the state. There are large numbers of Americans of English and German ancestry in Idaho. [[Immigration to the United States|Immigration]] from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 14,522 people, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 61,273 people.

According to the American Immigration Council, in 2018, the top countries of origin for Idaho's immigrants were Mexico, Canada, the Philippines, China and Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/sites/default/files/research/immigrants_in_idaho.pdf|title=Immigrants in Idaho}}</ref>

Idaho's population increased by 17.3% from 2010 to 2020, the second fastest rate of growth of any state that decade.<ref>[https://www.census.gov/library/stories/state-by-state/idaho-population-change-between-census-decade.html Idaho: 2020 Census], United States Census Bureau, August 25, 2021.</ref>

Nampa, about {{convert|20|mi|-1}} west of downtown Boise, became the state's second largest city in the late 1990s, passing Pocatello and Idaho Falls.

===Airports===
Major airports include the [[Boise Airport]] which serves the southwest region of Idaho and the [[Spokane International Airport]] (in [[Spokane, Washington]]) which serves northern Idaho. Other airports with scheduled service are the [[Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport]] serving the [[Palouse]]; the [[Lewiston-Nez Perce County Airport]], serving the Lewis-Clark Valley and [[North Central Idaho|north central]] and west central Idaho; The [[Magic Valley Regional Airport]] in Twin Falls; [[Friedman Memorial Airport]] in Hailey; the [[Idaho Falls Regional Airport]]; and the [[Pocatello Regional Airport]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/major-airports-idaho-25709.html|title=Major Airports in Idaho|website=Traveltips.usatoday.com|access-date=September 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904043747/http://traveltips.usatoday.com/major-airports-idaho-25709.html|archive-date=September 4, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Railroads===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2022}}
Idaho is served by three transcontinental railroads. The [[Burlington Northern Santa Fe]] (BNSF) connects the [[Idaho Panhandle]] with [[Seattle]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], and [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]] to the west, and [[Minneapolis]] and Chicago to the east. The [[BNSF]] travels through [[Kootenai County, Idaho|Kootenai]], [[Bonner County, Idaho|Bonner]], and [[Boundary County, Idaho|Boundary]] counties. The [[Union Pacific Railroad]] crosses North Idaho, entering from Canada through [[Boundary County, Idaho|Boundary]] and [[Bonner County, Idaho|Bonner]], and proceeding to Spokane. [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] uses [[Union Pacific Railroad]] tracks in North Idaho, carrying products from [[Alberta, Canada|Alberta]] to [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]] and [[Portland, Oregon]]. [[Amtrak]]'s Empire Builder crosses northern Idaho, with its only stop being in [[Sandpoint, Idaho|Sandpoint]]. [[Montana Rail Link]] also operates between [[Billings, Montana]], and [[Sandpoint, Idaho]].

The [[Union Pacific Railroad]] also crosses southern Idaho traveling between Portland, Oregon, Green River, [[Wyoming]], and [[Ogden, Utah]], and serves [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], [[Nampa, Idaho|Nampa]], [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]], and Pocatello.

===Ports===
The Port of Lewiston is the farthest inland Pacific port on the west coast. A series of dams and locks on the Snake River and Columbia River facilitate barge travel from Lewiston to Portland, where goods are loaded on ocean-going vessels.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Who We Are |url=https://portoflewiston.com/our-port/who-we-are/ |access-date=2023-10-17 |website=Port of Lewiston |language=en-US}}</ref>

===State constitution===
{{see also|Idaho Constitutional Convention}}
The constitution of Idaho is roughly modeled on the national constitution, with several additions. The constitution defines the form and functions of the state government, and may be amended through [[plebiscite]]. The state constitution presently requires the state government to maintain a [[balanced budget]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=https://history.idaho.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/ID%20Constitution%2010_30_2014.pdf|title=Constitution of the State of Idaho|website=History.idaho.gov|access-date=September 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525200628/https://history.idaho.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/ID%20Constitution%2010_30_2014.pdf|archive-date=May 25, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Idaho Code and Statutes===
All of Idaho's state laws are contained in the Idaho Code and Statutes. The code is amended through the legislature with the approval of the governor. Idaho still operates under its original (1889) state constitution.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

===State government===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2022}}
The constitution of Idaho provides for three branches of government: the executive, legislative and judicial branches. Idaho has a [[bicameral]] legislature, elected from 35 legislative districts, each represented by one senator and two representatives.

Since 1946, statewide elected constitutional officers have been elected to four-year terms. They include: [[List of Governors of Idaho|Governor]], [[Lieutenant Governor of Idaho|Lieutenant Governor]], [[Secretary of State of Idaho|Secretary of State]], [[Idaho state controller]] (Auditor before 1994), Treasurer, [[Idaho Attorney General|Attorney General]], and Superintendent of Public Instruction.

Last contested in 1966, Inspector of Mines was an originally elected constitutional office. Afterward it was an appointed position and ultimately done away with entirely in 1974.

Idaho's government has an [[Alcoholic beverage control state|alcohol monopoly]]; the [[Idaho State Liquor Division]].

====Executive branch====
{{Further |List of Governors of Idaho||Lieutenant Governor of Idaho|Secretary of State of Idaho}}

The governor of Idaho serves a four-year term and is elected during what is nationally referred to as midterm elections. As such, the governor is not elected in the same election year as the president of the United States. The current governor is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Brad Little]], who was first elected in 2018 and re-elected in 2022. Idaho is 1 of 13 states with no term limits for Governor.<ref>The other 12 are Washington, Utah, Texas, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, & New Hampshire. [https://www.termlimits.com/which-states-have-term-limits-on-governor/]</ref>

====Legislative branch====
{{Main |Idaho Legislature}}
[[File:House of Representatives Chamber, Idaho State Capitol.jpg|thumb|right|Chamber of the House of Representatives in 2018]]

Idaho's [[State legislature (United States)|legislature]] is part-time. Because of this, Idaho's legislators are considered "citizen legislators", meaning their position as a legislator is not their main occupation. However, the session may be extended if necessary, and often is.

Terms for both the [[Idaho Senate|Senate]] and [[Idaho House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] are two years. Legislative elections occur every even numbered year.

Both of Idaho's state legislative chambers have been continuously controlled by Republicans since 1960, although Democratic legislators are routinely elected from Boise, Pocatello, [[Blaine County, Idaho|Blaine County]] and the northern Panhandle.

====Judicial branch====
{{Main |Courts of Idaho}}

The highest court in Idaho is the [[Idaho Supreme Court]]. There is also an intermediate [[appellate court]], the [[Idaho Court of Appeals]], which hears cases assigned to it from the Supreme Court. The state's District Courts serve seven judicial districts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isc.idaho.gov/district.htm |title=Idaho District Court Websites |publisher=ISC |place=ID |access-date=December 17, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216011413/http://www.isc.idaho.gov/district.htm |archive-date=December 16, 2008 }}</ref>

After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], many Midwestern and Southern [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] moved to the [[Idaho Territory]]. As a result, the early territorial legislatures were solidly Democrat-controlled. In contrast, most of the territorial governors were appointed by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidents and were Republicans. This led to sometimes-bitter clashes between the two parties, including a range war with the Democrats backing the sheepherders and the Republicans the cattlemen, which ended in the [[Jack Davis (prospector)|"Diamondfield" Jack Davis]] murder trial. In the 1880s, Republicans became more prominent in local politics.

In 1864, Clinton DeWitt Smith removed the territorial seal and the state constitution from a locked safe, and took them to Boise. This effectively moved the capital from where they were stored ([[Lewiston, Idaho]]) to the current capital, Boise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idahoptv.org/capitoloflight/article-05.cfm|title=Capitol Move or Theft?—Essays—Capitol of Light (Idaho Public Television)|website=Idahotv.org|access-date=September 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525200618/http://idahoptv.org/capitoloflight/article-05.cfm|archive-date=May 25, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Since statehood, the Republican Party has usually been the dominant party in Idaho. At one time, Idaho had two Democratic parties, one being the mainstream and the other called the Anti-Mormon Democrats, lasting into the early 20th century. In the 1890s and early 1900s, the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]] enjoyed prominence, while the Democratic Party maintained a brief dominance in the 1930s during the [[Great Depression]]. Since World War{{nbsp}}II, most statewide-elected officials have been Republicans, though the Democrats did hold the majority in the House (by one seat) in 1958 and the governorship from 1971 to 1995.

Idaho Congressional delegations have also been generally Republican since statehood. Several Idaho Democrats have had electoral success in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] over the years, but the [[United States Senate|Senate]] delegation has been a Republican stronghold for decades. Several Idaho Republicans, including current Senators [[Mike Crapo]] and [[Jim Risch]], have won reelection to the Senate, but only [[Frank Church]] has won reelection as a Democrat. Church's [[1974 United States Senate election in Idaho|1974]] victory was the last win for his party for either Senate seat, and [[Walt Minnick]]'s 2008 victory in the [[Idaho's 1st congressional district|1st congressional district]] was the last Democratic win in any congressional race.

In modern times, Idaho has been a reliably Republican state in presidential politics. It has not supported a Democrat for [[president of the United States|president]] since [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]. Even in that election, [[Lyndon Johnson]] defeated [[Barry Goldwater]] in the state by fewer than two percentage points, compared to a landslide nationally. In [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]], Republican [[George W. Bush]] carried Idaho by a margin of 38 percentage points and with 68.4% of the vote, winning in 43 of 44 counties. Only [[Blaine County, Idaho|Blaine County]], which contains the [[Sun Valley, Idaho|Sun Valley]] ski resort, supported [[John Kerry]], who owns a home in the area. In [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] [[Barack Obama]]'s 36.1&nbsp;percent<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.idsos.state.id.us/elect/RESULTS/2008/general/tot_stwd.htm | place = ID | publisher = Secretary of State Election Division | date = November 4, 2008 | title = General Election Results | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081215210242/http://www.idsos.state.id.us/ELECT/RESULTS/2008/general/tot_stwd.htm | archive-date = December 15, 2008}}.</ref> showing was the best for a Democratic presidential candidate in Idaho since [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]]. However, Republican margins were narrower in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] and [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]].

In the 2006 elections, Republicans, led by gubernatorial candidate [[C. L. Otter|Butch Otter]], won all the state's constitutional offices and retained both of the state's seats in the House. However, Democrats picked up several seats in the Idaho Legislature, notably in the Boise area.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.ncsl.org/ncsldb/elect98/profile.cfm?yearsel=2006&statesel=ID |publisher=NCSL |title=Elections 1 998 |type=profile |year=2006 |contribution=ID |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501023622/http://www.ncsl.org/ncsldb/elect98/profile.cfm?yearsel=2006&statesel=ID |archive-date=May 1, 2009 }}</ref>
