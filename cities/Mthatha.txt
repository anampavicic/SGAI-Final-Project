== History ==
[[File:Caesar Carl Hans Henkel02.jpg|thumb|left|300px|1913 panoramic view of Mthatha with the [[Mthatha River]] in the foreground and the [[Drakensberg mountains]] in the distance by [[Caesar Carl Hans Henkel]]]]

The settlement existed in the 1870s as a buffer-zone, in response to reported tensions between [[Mpondo]] and neighbouring Thembu groups, and in 1875 a magistrate's office was opened. The first magistrate, appointed that year, was a man named J F Boyes. The settlement developed during the next few years, becoming a military post for the British colonial forces in 1882. The town itself was founded in 1883, along the banks of the [[Mthatha River]]. Nearly a century later, the [[Mthatha Dam]] was constructed about eight kilometers upstream of the town.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Situation analysis of water quality in the Umtata River catchment|author=Fatoki, OS, Muyima, NYO and Lujiza, M|journal=Water SA|volume=27|issue=4|date=October 2001|doi=10.4314/wsa.v27i4.4959|doi-access=free}}</ref> Mthatha became the leading administrative centre of the area, having both [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa|Anglican]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] cathedrals. The town became the headquarters of the Transkeian Territories General Council (known as the Bunga), and the building which served as a parliament was erected in 1903.<ref name="SAVenues">{{cite web| title= Umtata| publisher= South African Venues| url=https://www.sa-venues.com/attractionsec/umtata.php | access-date=28 July 2017}}</ref> This was followed by the construction of the town hall in 1908.<ref name="Britannica">{{cite web| title= Umtata South Africa| publisher= Britannica| url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Umtata | access-date=28 July 2017}}</ref> A branch of the [[University of Fort Hare]] was established in the town, and after the independence of the [[Transkei]] in 1977 it became the [[University of Transkei]]. In 2005, the University of Transkei with the Border Technikon and Eastern Cape Technikon were merged to form the [[Walter Sisulu University for Technology and Science]]. The campus was the base for the region's first community radio station, [https://web.archive.org/web/20091017084208/http://www.ucrfm.com/ UCRFM], which started in 1996 and has become a significant community broadcaster.

On 1 August 1973, Mthatha High Court was opened.<ref name="SAVenues">{{cite web| title= Umtata| publisher= South African Venues| url=https://www.sa-venues.com/attractionsec/umtata.php | access-date=28 July 2017}}</ref><ref name="SAHistoryOnline">{{cite web  | title=A High Court is established in Umtata, capital of the Transkei.  | publisher=South African History Online  | url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/high-court-established-umtata-capital-transkeia  | access-date=28 July 2017  }}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In 1973, a summit meeting of the black homeland leaders was held at Umtata, when they decided to federate their respective states after independence. In 1976, [[Transkei]] was granted independence as a bantustan, a nominally independent state not recognised outside South Africa. Mthatha served as the capital under the name "Umtata".<ref name="SAVenues">{{cite web| title= Umtata| publisher= South African Venues| url=https://www.sa-venues.com/attractionsec/umtata.php | access-date=28 July 2017}}</ref> Under the Transkei regime, an airport named after the then ruler of Transkei [[Kaiser Matanzima|KD Matanzima]] was built. On 21 May 2012, the airport was formally handed over to [[Lindiwe Sisulu]], then Minister of Defence, by [[Noxolo Kiviet]], then Premier of the Eastern Cape. However, the South African National Defence Force relinquished its control of the airport in 2013. The airport was renamed [[Mthatha Airport]].

After the end of apartheid, some sections of the African business and professional community migrated to traditionally white areas of economic activity, and this has been widely cited as a cause of economic recession in the municipality, but a number of construction projects offer hope for renewal. 

Many of South Africa's black leaders – including [[Walter Sisulu]], [[Sabelo Phama]], [[Bantu Holomisa]] and [[Nelson Mandela]] — come from this area, and the retired Nelson Rholihlahla Mandela lived in his home village of [[Qunu]] a few kilometres south of Mthatha.

Mthatha is a focal point of the Nelson Mandela Route which celebrates the life of Nelson Mandela. There are three Nelson Mandela Museums. Spread across three sites, they collect, interpret and exhibit key aspects of the story of the life and times of Nelson Mandela. The three historical sites of the museum are at Mvezo, Qunu and the Bunga Building in Mthatha. In the Bunga Building is the story of the ''[[Long Walk to Freedom]]'' and an exhibition of the many gifts received by Nelson Mandela. 

On 2 March 2004, Umtata was renamed "Mthatha".

==Business==
{{importance section|date=May 2020}}
Mthatha has 2 major taxi businesses: Uncedo Taxi Association and Border Taxi Association. These associations had a feud over the [[R61 (South Africa)|R61 road]] from Mthatha to [[Libode]] and [[Port St. Johns]]. This feud resulted in taxi ranks being closed by the Government. Over 60 fatalities were reported during the period of the feud. In  2018, the [[Minister of Police (South Africa)|Minister of Police]] [[Bheki Cele]] closed all taxi ranks in Mthatha and demanded that the taxi associations negotiate with the police and merge to form one association but they refused. As a result, some taxis were impounded by the police. Sagas ranks were opened in Mthatha but the ranks that were not opened triggered riots with people protesting and police firing rubber bullets and tear gas affecting a nearby school (St John's College).

In 2019, two final year students, from the Walter Sisulu University developed affordable prosthetics. These students, Siphosethu Mgwili and Zanodumo Godlimpi, were awarded the first ever WSU vice-chancellor's award for most innovative prototype.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Walter Sisulu University students' groundbreaking inventions to save amputees millions|url=https://www.rnews.co.za/article/walter-sisulu-university-students-groundbreaking-inventions-to-save-amputees-millions|date=November 25, 2019|website=rnews.co.za|access-date=2020-05-11}}</ref>

== Religion ==
The city is the episcopal see of both the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mthatha]] and the [[Anglican Diocese of Mthatha]].

==Economy==

Mthatha falls under OR Tambo District Municipality which is the poorest district in the Eastern Cape by all poverty measures. It has the lowest HDI (0.45) and the highest poverty gap (2 231 million) in the Eastern Cape. The number of people living in poverty is also high in this district (64.6%), unemployment is at 65.5% and the literacy rate 42.2%.<ref name="OLF">{{cite web| title=Mthatha| publisher= Olive Leaf Foundation| url=http://www.olf.org.za/region/mthatha/380/ | access-date=28 July 2017}}</ref>

In 2006, it was reported the King Sabata Dalindyebo Local Municipality was owed R250 million by residents in unpaid service fees. It counts among its creditors the South African Revenue Service (to which it owes R18-million), the Public Investment Commission (R84 million), the national water affairs and forestry department (R46 million) and the Development Bank of Southern Africa (R13 million).<ref name="EnochMgijima">{{cite web | last=Mgibisa | first= Mbuyisa | title= Mthatha in dire straits | date= 25 October 2006 | publisher=Mail & Guardian| url=https://mg.co.za/article/2006-10-25-mthatha-in-dire-straits | access-date=28 July 2017}}</ref> According to SA Delivery, The average annual income of a black Mthatha resident is R15,762.<ref name="SADELIVERY">{{cite web | last=Harrison| first= Karen| title= Can Mthatha turn the corner? | publisher=SA Delivery| url=http://sadelivery.co.za/files/back_issues/delivery/Edition18/mthatha%202302.pdf | access-date=28 July 2017}}</ref> The town has also been plagued by complaints about the state of its roads and the collapse of its utilities and infrastructure. It's widely reported that the general decline into dysfunction and societal fragility is caused by endemic political corruption, municipal incompetence and widespread criminality. Despite all that, a new dawn is beckoning for Mthatha with the construction of infrastructure like BT Ngebs Mall and Mayfair Hotel.

==Facilities==
The Sinawe [[Thuthuzela Care Centre]], a rape crisis centre launched in 2001, sees between 60 and 120 patients a month, from up to {{cvt|200|km}} away. It won an award for being "the best-run care centre in South Africa". ''Sinawe'' means "we are with you" in [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]].<ref>{{cite web | title=“We are with you”: In South Africa, care centres for rape survivors give hope as cases rise|first=Masimba |last=Tafirenyika | website=UNSDG | date=20 July 2021 | url=https://unsdg.un.org/latest/stories/we-are-you-south-africa-care-centres-rape-survivors-give-hope-cases-rise | access-date=19 July 2023}}</ref>

Mthatha has a warm [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb'') closely bordering on both a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') and a [[semi-arid climate]] (''BSh''/''BSk'').

Mthatha is prone to severe thundersoms, some of which are tornadic in nature. Mthatha has been hit by several tornadoes between 1995 and 2023, the most recent being the EF3 tornado that damaged residential areas near the airport, including the airport itself.{{Citation needed|date=January 2024}}
