==History==
Khulna was part of the ancient kingdoms of [[Vanga Kingdom|Vanga]], [[Gangaridai]] and [[Samatata]]. After the end of the [[Pala Empire]], it was ruled by the [[Sena dynasty]] during the 12th-century reign of [[Ballala Sena]], and formed part of the Bagri division of Bengal.
During the 14th century, [[Shamsuddin Firoz Shah]] was the first Muslim ruler to arrive in the city. Muslim settlements increased during the time of [[Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah]], and many mosques and shrines were established. A Muslim saint, [[Khan Jahan Ali]], acquired a ''[[jagir]]'' (fiefdom) encompassing a large part of Khulna Division from the king of [[Gauḍa (city)|Gauḍa]] during the 15th century and renamed the region as Jahanabad. Ali ruled until he died in 1459.<ref name="kd">{{cite web | url=http://www.khulna.gov.bd/node/1076732 | title=জেলার ঐতিহ্য | publisher=Khulna District Portal | access-date=21 December 2013 | archive-url=https://archive.today/20131213164555/http://www.khulna.gov.bd/node/1076732 | archive-date=13 December 2013 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

After Ali's death, the city became part of the [[Bengal Sultanate]]. During the reign of [[Daud Khan Karrani]] in the 16th century, Vikramaditya (one of Karrani's chief ministers) obtained a grant in southern Bengal—including Khulna—when Karrani was fighting the [[Mughal empire|Mughals]]. Vikramaditya established a sovereign kingdom with its capital at Iswaripur (in present-day [[Satkhira District]]). He was succeeded by his son, [[Pratapaditya]], who gained preeminence over the [[Baro-Bhuyan]]s and controlled southern Bengal. Vikramaditya was defeated by Raja [[Man Singh I]], a Hindu Rajput general of the Mughal emperor [[Akbar]], in 1611.<ref name="gazetteer" />

Khulna was ruled by autonomous Bengali [[nawab]]s until 1793 when the British [[East India Company]] abolished ''nizamat'' (local rule) and took control of the city. Becoming part of Jessore District in 1842, it became the headquarters of Khulna District (the Khulna and Bagerhat subdivisions of Jessore District, the Satkhira subdivision of [[24 Parganas]] district, and the Sundarbans) in 1882.<ref name="gazetteer">{{cite book | url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V15_293.gif | title=Imperial Gazetteer of India | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Hunter, William Wilson | author-link=William Wilson Hunter | year=1908 | location=Oxford, UK | pages=287}}</ref> Khulna had a ''pouroshava'' ([[municipal council]]) in 1884, which became a [[municipal corporation]] in 1984.

Before 19 August 1947, Khulna District was part of undivided Bengal. Khulna first declared itself as part of India in 1947, and the Indian flag was flown on 15 August. Syed Mohammad Abdul Halim (an official of the Bengali civil service) requested Khulna's inclusion in Pakistan, and the boundary commission declared that the city was part of [[East Bengal]]. [[A. K. Fazlul Huq|Sher e Bangla A.K.Fazlul Haq]], Muslim League leaders [[Khan A Sabur]], Advocate [[Hamidul Haq Chowdhury]], A. F. M. Abdul Jalil, and Abdul Mojid Khan were also involved in the process.
