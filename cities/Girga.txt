'''Girga''' ({{langx|arz|جرجا}} {{IPA|arz|ˈɡeɾɡæ|}}), alternatively '''Digirga''' or '''Digurga'''<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Peust |first=Carsten |title=Die Toponyme vorarabischen Ursprungs im modernen Ägypten |url=http://www.peust.de/ortsnamen_original.pdf |page=43}}</ref> is a city in the [[Sohag Governorate]] of [[Upper Egypt]]. It is located on the west bank of the [[Nile River]]. It is the metropolitan see of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]], and is the oldest continuously-inhabited city on the African continent.

==Name==
{{hiero|1=grg<ref name = Budge1049/><ref name = Gauthier217/> |2=<hiero>U17-O49</hiero>|align=left|era=default}}
The name of the city comes from {{Langx|egy|(tꜣ)-grg.t|lit=the settlement}}, which is also preserved in possibly corrupted {{Langx|cop|ⲑⲁⲣϫⲉ|translit=tarje}} and its alternative name Digirga.<ref name=":0" />

Some [[Egyptology|Egyptologists]] such as [[Heinrich Brugsch|Brugsch]] believe that the name of the city derives from the ancient Egyptian word ''grg miri-amoun Ramessou'' which means "The establishment of [[Ramesses II]]",<ref name="Brugsch853">{{cite book |last1=Brugsch |first1=Heinrich |title=Dictionnaire géographique de l'ancienne Egypte: contenant par ordre alphabétique la nomenclature comparée des noms propres géographiques qui se rencontrent sur les monuments et dans les papyrus |date=1879 |publisher=J. C. Hinrichs |pages=853–854 |url=https://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/brugsch1879/0873/image}}</ref> although [[Georges Daressy|Daressy]] and [[Wallis Budge|Budge]] identify the name with Coptic [[Balyana]] near [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]].<ref name="Budge1049">{{cite book |last1=Wallis Budge |first1=E. A. |title=An Egyptian hieroglyphic dictionary: with an index of English words, king list and geological list with indexes, list of hieroglyphic characters, coptic and semitic alphabets, etc. Vol II |date=1920 |publisher=[[John Murray (publishing house)|John Murray]] |page=[https://archive.org/details/egyptianhierogly02budguoft/page/1049 1049] |url=https://archive.org/details/egyptianhierogly02budguoft}}</ref><ref name="Gauthier217">{{cite book |last1=Gauthier |first1=Henri |title=Dictionnaire des Noms Géographiques Contenus dans les Textes Hiéroglyphiques Dictionnaire des Noms Géographiques Contenus dans les Textes Hiéroglyphiques Dictionnaire des Noms Géographiques Contenus dans les Textes Hiéroglyphiques Vol. 5 |date=1928 |pages=217, 218 |url=https://archive.org/details/Gauthier1928/page/n111}}</ref>

Through folk etymology the city became associated with [[Saint George|St. George]] and a now non-existent monastery dedicated to him nearby, hence [[Leo Africanus]] calls it ''Giorgia'' and Peust suggests an older vocalisation ''Gurga''.<ref name=":0" />

==Overview==
Girga was the capital of the Girga Governorate until 1960, when the capital was moved to [[Sohag]] and the name of the governorate changed accordingly.<ref>{{cite book |last=Law |first=Gwillim |title=Administrative Subdivisions of Countries: A Comprehensive World Reference, 1900 through 1998 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4lmOAAAAMAAJ&q=Girga |format=snippet view |access-date=2010-08-07 |year=1999 |publisher=McFarland |location=Jefferson, NC |isbn=978-0-7864-0729-3 |page=114}}</ref> Girga has an estimated population of 71,564 (as of 1986) and has various economic industries which include cane sugar manufacturing and pottery.

==History==
[[File:Girgeh (1890) - TIMEA.jpg|left|thumb|Girga in 1890]]
The city might have been the location of ancient city of [[Thinis]] (Greek name; also spelled This) – the first capital city of unified Egypt under [[Narmer]]. As of 2023, it remains inconclusive whether Girga or nearby village of Birba is the site of Thinis (Birba was confirmed to be the site of the capital of Egypt during the 1st and 2nd dynasties{{Source?|date=June 2023}}). 

There are ancient sites located on the territory of Girga including [[Beit Khallaf]], a necropolis with mudbrick tombs dating back to the 3rd dynasty.

Girga was the capital of Upper Egypt during [[Egypt Eyalet|Ottoman rule]].

In 1791, [[Yousab El Abah|Saint Yousab El Abah]] (also Joseph el-Abbah) was the bishop of the city.

In 1907 Girga had a population of 19,893, of whom about one-third were [[Copts]].

As lately as the middle of the 18th century the town stood about 0.4 km from the river, but in the beginning of the 20th century it stood on the bank, the intervening space having been washed away, together with a large part of the town, by the stream continually encroaching on its left bank.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Girga|volume=12|page=48}}</ref>

== Places of worship ==

=== Mosques ===
[[File:GirgaSiniInside.jpg|thumb|Chinese Mosque]]

* '''Chinese Mosque''' ({{Langx|ar|المسجد الصينى|translit=almasjid assini}}): The mosque was presumably built in about 1150 AH (= [[1737]]) in the historical district of al-Qaysariyya by Muhammad bey al-Faqari who became a governor in 1117 AH (= 1705/1706) in [[Egypt Eyalet|Ottoman times]]. Although it is called Chinese, no materials imported from China were used in its construction, and it got its name after porcelain used in its decoration.
* '''Osman Bey Mosque''' ({{Langx|ar|مسجد عثمان بك}})
* '''Al-Fuqara Mosque''' ({{Langx|ar|مسجد الفقراء}})
* '''Jalal Bey Mosque''' ({{Langx|ar|مسجد جلال بك}})
* '''Al-Mitwalli Mosque''' ({{Langx|ar|جامع المتولي}})

=== Churches and monasteries ===

* '''Monastery of Archangel Michael''' ({{Langx|ar|دير الملاك ميخائيل|translit=dayr al-malak mikhail}}): Situated on the right bank of the Nile opposite of Girga. Since 1910 this site has been celebrated among archaeologists, because the discoveries made there have shed light on the region's prehistory.<ref>{{Cite web |date= |title=Claremont Coptic Encyclopedia |url=https://ccdl.claremont.edu/digital/collection/cce/id/652/rec/1}}</ref>
* '''Church of Archangel Michael''' ({{Langx|ar|كنيسة الملاك ميخائيل|translit=kenisa al-malak mikhail}})
* '''Church of Saint George''' ({{Langx|ar|كنيسة مارجرجس|translit=kenisa mar jirjis}})
* '''Church of Theodore Tiron ('''{{Langx|ar|كنيسة الأمير تادرس|translit=kenisa alamir tadrus}})

==Climate==
[[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system]] classifies its climate as [[hot desert climate|hot desert]] (BWh).
