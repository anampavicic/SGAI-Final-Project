'''Bogor City''' ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Kota Bogor'') or '''Bogor''' ({{langx|su|{{Sund|ᮘᮧᮌᮧᮁ}}}}, {{langx|nl|Buitenzorg}}) is a [[Cities of Indonesia|city]] in the [[West Java]] [[Provinces of Indonesia|province]], [[Indonesia]]. Located around {{convert|60|km|sp=us}} south of the national capital of [[Jakarta]], Bogor is the 6th largest city in the [[Jakarta metropolitan area]] and the 14th overall nationwide.<ref name="kesehat">[http://www.depkes.go.id/downloads/Penduduk%20Kab%20Kota%20Umur%20Tunggal%202014.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208021950/http://www.depkes.go.id/downloads/Penduduk%20Kab%20Kota%20Umur%20Tunggal%202014.pdf|date=8 February 2014}} Estimasi Penduduk Menurut Umur Tunggal Dan Jenis Kelamin 2014 Kementerian Kesehatan</ref> The city covers an area of 111.39&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, and it had a population of 950,334 in the 2010 Census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 1,043,070 in the 2020 Census.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> The official estimate as at the end of 2023 was 1,127,408.<ref>{{citation|title=Data Dukcapil 2023|url=https://gis.dukcapil.kemendagri.go.id/peta/|access-date=30 January 2024}}</ref> Bogor is an important economic, scientific, cultural, and tourist center, as well as a mountain resort.

During the [[Middle Ages]], the city served as the capital of the [[Sunda Kingdom]] ({{langx|su|Karajaan Sunda}}) and was called '''''[[Pakuan Pajajaran]]''''' or '''''Dayeuh Pakuan'''''. During the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial era]], it was named '''''Buitenzorg''''' (''"without worries"'' in Dutch) and served as the summer residence of the [[Governor-general of the Dutch East Indies|Governor-General]] of the [[Dutch East Indies]].

With several hundred thousand people living on an area of about {{convert|20|km2|abbr=on}}, the central part of Bogor is one of the world's most densely populated areas. The city has a [[Istana Bogor|presidential palace]] and a [[Bogor Botanical Garden|botanical garden]] ({{langx|id|Kebun Raya Bogor}}) – one of the oldest and largest in the world. It bears the nickname "Rainy City" (''Kota Hujan''), because of frequent rain showers, even during the dry season.

==History==
===Precolonial period===
{{Further|Pakuan Pajajaran}}
[[File:Prasasti tugu.jpg|thumb|left|120px|A 1600-year-old stone inscription (''prasasti'') of the [[Tarumanagara]] kingdom era]]
The first mention of a settlement at present Bogor dates to the 5th century when the area was part of [[Tarumanagara]], one of the earliest states in [[Indonesian history]].<ref name="Iskandar"/><ref name="History"/><ref name="15 abad"/> After a series of defeats by the neighboring [[Srivijaya]], Tarumanagara was transformed into the [[Sunda Kingdom]], and in 669, the capital of Sunda was built between two parallel rivers, the [[Ciliwung]] and [[Cisadane River|Cisadane]]. It was named [[Pakuan Pajajaran]], in old Sundanese meaning "a place between the parallel [rivers]", and became the predecessor of the modern Bogor.<ref name="Pasundan"/><ref name="cikalbogor"/>

Over the next several centuries, Pakuan Pajajaran became one of the largest cities in medieval Indonesia with a population reaching 48,000.<ref name="cikalbogor"/> The name Pajajaran was then used from the 16th century for the entire kingdom, and the capital was simply called Pakuan.<ref name="cikalbogor"/><ref name = "sunda"/><ref name="cikalbogor2"/><ref name="Koler"/><ref name="Karta"/> The chronicles of that time were written in [[Sanskrit]], which was the language used for official and religious purposes, using the [[Pallava script]], on rock [[stele]]s called ''prasasti''.<ref name="History"/><ref name="prasasti"/> The prasasti found in and around Bogor differ in shape and text style from other Indonesian prasasti and are among the main attractions of the city.<ref name="History"/>

From the 9th-15th centuries, the capital moved between Pakuan and other cities of the kingdom, and finally returned to Pakuan by [[King Siliwangi]] (''[[Sri Baduga Maharaja]]'') on 3 June 1482 – the day of his coronation. Since 1973, this date is celebrated in Bogor as an official city holiday.<ref name="o144"/><ref name = "depok"/>

In 1579, Pakuan was captured and almost completely destroyed by the army of the [[Sultanate of Banten]],<ref name="VI"/><ref name="Bolshaya Soviet entsiklopediya2"/> causing the existence of the State of Sunda to cease. The city was abandoned and remained uninhabited for decades.<ref name="cikalbogor"/><ref name = "o144"/>

===Colonial period===

====Dutch East India Company====
[[File:Pakuanpajajaran_(vectoriser).svg|thumb|left|200px|A Dutch map showing the location of the Pakuan Pajajaran relatively to Buitenzorg]]
In the second half of the 17th century, the abandoned Pakuan as with most of West Java, while formally remaining under the Sultanate of Banten, gradually passed under the control of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC). The formal transition occurred on 17 April 1684 with a signed agreement between the Crown Prince of Banten and the VOC.<ref name="depok2">{{cite web |url= https://nauriz.com/2020/02/21/peraturan-daerah-kota-depok-nomor-01-tahun-1999/ |title= Peraturan Daerah Kota Depok nomor 01 tahun 1999 |publisher= Walikota Depok |year= 1999 |access-date= 21 June 2010 |language= id |archive-date= 24 November 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20201124095957/https://nauriz.com/2020/02/21/peraturan-daerah-kota-depok-nomor-01-tahun-1999/ |url-status= live }}</ref>

The first, and temporal, colonial settlement at Pakuan was a camp of lieutenant Tanoejiwa, a [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] employed by the VOC who was sent in 1687 to develop the area.<ref name="cikalbogor2"/><ref name="depok2"/><ref name="theyo"/> It was seriously damaged by the eruption on 4–5 January 1699 of the [[Mount Salak]] volcano ({{langx|id|Gunung Salak}}).  However, the concomitant forest fires removed much forest, leaving much area for the planned rice and coffee plantations.<ref name="cikalbogor2"/> In a short time, several agricultural settlements appeared around Pakuan, the largest being Kampung Baru (lit. "new village").<ref name="History"/>
In 1701, they were combined into an administrative district; Tanoejiwa was chosen as the head of the district and is regarded as the founder of the modern [[Bogor Regency]].<ref name = "depok2"/><ref name="theyo"/>

The district was further developed during the 1703 Dutch mission headed by the Inspector General of the VOC [[Abraham van Riebeeck]] (the son of the founder of [[Cape Town]] [[Jan van Riebeeck]] and later Governor of Dutch East Indies).<ref name="cikalbogor2"/><ref name="depok2"/> The expedition of van Riebeeck performed a detailed study of the Pakuan ruins, discovered and described many archaeological artifacts, including prasasti, and erected buildings for the VOC employees.<ref name = "theyo"/> The area attracted the Dutch by a favorable geographical position and mild climate, preferred over the hot [[Jakarta|Batavia]] which was then the administrative center of the Dutch East Indies.<ref name = "theyo"/> In 1744–1745, the residence of the Governor-General was built in Pakuan which was hosting the government during the summer.<ref name="theyo"/>

In 1746, by the order of the Governor-General [[Gustaaf Willem van Imhoff]], the Palace, a nearby Dutch settlement and nine native settlements were merged into an administrative division named Buitenzorg (Dutch for "beyond (or outside) concerns", meaning "without worries" or "carefree", cf. Frederick the Great of Prussia's summer palace outside Potsdam, Sanssouci, with the same meaning in French).<ref name="Britannica1911"/><ref name = "unof"/> Around the same time, the first reference to ''Bogor'' as the local name of the city was documented; it was mentioned in the administration report from 7 April 1752 with respect to the part of Buitenzorg adjacent to the Palace.<ref name="Pasundanskaya istoriya"/> Later this name became used for the whole city as the local alternative to Buitenzorg.<ref name="Britannica1911"/> This name is believed to originate from the Javanese word ''bogor'' meaning sugar palm (''Arenga pinnata'') or ''bokor'' (a large bowl made from metal), which is still used in the Indonesian language.<ref name="Pasundanskaya istoriya"/><ref name="KBBI"/> Alternative origins are the old-Javanese word ''bhagar'' (meaning cow), or simply the misspelling of "Buitenzorg" by the local residents.<ref name="Pasundanskaya istoriya"/>

The city grew rapidly in the late 18th – early 19th centuries.<ref name="theyo"/> This growth was partly stimulated by the temporary occupation of the Dutch East Indies by the United Kingdom in 1811–1815 – the British landed on Java and other [[Sunda Islands]] to prevent their capture by [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France]] which then conquered the Netherlands. The head of the British administration [[Stamford Raffles]] moved the administrative center from Batavia to Buitenzorg and implemented new and more efficient management techniques.<ref name="theyo"/><ref name="Raffles"/>

====Rule of the Kingdom of the Netherlands====
[[File:Coat of Arms of Buitenzorg (1932).svg|thumb|200px|Coat of Arms of Buitenzorg (now Bogor) during Dutch colonial era, granted in 1932]]
After Buitenzorg was returned to the Dutch, it fell under the rule of the Kingdom of the Netherlands rather than VOC. The Buitenzorg Palace was reinstated as the summer residence of the Governor-General. The surrounding territory was also organized into a new [[Residency (administrative division)|Residency]], the [[Buitenzorg Residency]]. A botanical garden was set up nearby in 1817, which was one of the world's largest gardens in the 19th century.<ref name="theyo"/><ref name="Britannica1911"/><ref>Sharon E. Kingsland (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=58EsPhsNuuwC&pg=PA30 The evolution of American ecology, 1890–2000], {{ISBN|0-8018-8171-4}}, p. 30</ref><ref name = "GE"/>

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Olieverfschildering voorstellend de grote postweg bij Buitenzorg TMnr 1012-1.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Great Post Road]] passing Buitenzorg in the 19th century]]
On 10 October 1834, Buitenzorg was seriously damaged by another eruption of the Salak volcanoes caused by an earthquake.<ref name="theyo"/><ref name="JP"/> Taking into account the seismic activity of the region, the governor's palace and office buildings constructed in 1840–1850 were built shorter but sturdier than those built prior to the eruption.<ref name="theyo"/> The Governor's decree of 1845 prescribed separate settlements of European, [[Han (people)|Chinese]] and Arab migrants within the city.<ref name="theyo"/>

In 1860–1880, the largest agricultural school in the colony was established in Buitenzorg. Other scientific institutions including a city library, natural science museum, biology, chemistry, and veterinary medicine laboratories were also constructed during this period. During this time, in 1867, the Buitenzorg Residency was downgraded from a full Residency to an Assistant Residency. By the end of the 19th century, Buitenzorg became one of the most developed and westernized cities in Indonesia.<ref name="cikalbogor2"/><ref name="theyo"/>

In 1904, Buitenzorg formally became the administrative center of the Dutch East Indies. However, real management remained in Batavia, which hosted most of the administrative offices and the main office of the governor.<ref name="History"/><ref name="Britannica1911"/> This status was revoked in the administrative reform of 1924, which divided the colony into provinces and made Buitenzorg seat of the new [[Buitenzorg Residency]] and center of West Java Province.<ref name="History"/>

===1942–1950===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Luchtfoto van het paleis van de Gouverneur-Generaal in Buitenzorg TMnr 60027049.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial picture of Bogor during the 1930s]]

During [[World War II]], Buitenzorg and the entire territory of the Dutch East Indies were occupied by Japanese forces; the occupation lasted from 6 March 1942 until the summer of 1945.<ref name="Japanese"/> As part of the efforts by the Japanese to promote nationalist (and thus anti-Dutch) sentiments among the local population the city was given the Indonesian name Bogor.<ref name="GE"/> The city had one of the major training centres of the Indonesian militia PETA (Pembela Tanah Air – "''Defenders of the Motherland''").<ref name = "PETA"/>

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Het hoofd van de deelstaat Negara Pasundan met zijn secretaris TMnr 60054594.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wiranatakusumah V|R. A. A. Muharram Wiranatakusuma]], president of the Pasundan State with his secretary in Bogor (1948)]]
On 17 August 1945, [[Sukarno]] and [[Muhammad Hatta|Hatta]] proclaimed independence, but the Dutch regained control of the town and adjoining areas. In February 1948, Buitenzorg was included in the quasi-independent state of West Java,({{langx|id|Negara Jawa Barat}}) which was renamed [[Pasundan]] in April 1948 ({{langx|id|Negara Pasundan}}). This state was established by the Netherlands as a step to transform their former colonial possessions in the East Indies into a dependent federation.<ref name="Pasundan..."/><ref name="VI12"/> In December 1949, Pasundan joined the [[Republic of the United States of Indonesia]] ({{langx|id|Republik Indonesia Serikat}}, RIS) established at the [[Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference]] of 23 August{{snd}}2 November 1949.<ref name="VI12"/><ref name="II"/> In February 1950, as a result of defeat of Pasundan in a quick military conflict with the Republic of Indonesia, the city became part of Indonesia, as formalized in August 1950,<ref name="VI12"/><ref name="II"/> and its name was officially declared as Bogor.<ref name="o144"/><ref name="UU16-50"/>

===Independence period===
As part of independent modern Indonesia, Bogor has a significant role in the cultural, scientific, and economic development of the country and West Java in particular – in part due to the legacy of infrastructure built during the colonial period. Its special position was further reinforced by the transformation of the former summer residence of the governor-general into the summer palace of the President of Indonesia.<ref name="cikalbogor2"/><ref name="Istana"/> In the 1990s–2000s, the city regularly hosted various international events, such as ministry-level meetings of the Asia-Pacific institutions<ref name="Klimat"/> and the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] summit of 15 November 1994.<ref name="ATES"/>

==Geography==
[[File:Mt. Salak viewed from Bogor.jpg|thumb|right|Bogor and [[Mount Salak]]]]
The city is situated in the western part of [[Java]] island, about 53&nbsp;km south of the metropolis of [[Jakarta]] and 85&nbsp;km northwest of the city of [[Bandung]], the administrative center of West Java Province.<ref name="o148"/> Bogor spreads over a [[Structural basin|basin]] near the volcanoes of Salak (which peaks at about 12&nbsp;km south) and [[Mount Gede]] (whose top is 22–25&nbsp;km south-east of the city).<ref name="o691"/> The average elevation is 265 meters, maximum 330 m, and minimum 190 meters above sea level.<ref name="o148"/> The terrain is rather uneven: 17.64&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of its area has slopes of 0–2°, 80.9&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> from 2° to 15°, 11&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> between 15° and 25°, 7.65&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> from 25° to 40° and 1.20&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> over 40°;<ref name="o771-5"/> the northern part is relatively flat and the southern part is more hilly.<ref name="o771-6"/>

The soils are dominated by volcanic sedimentary rocks.<ref name="o771-6"/> Given the proximity of large active volcanoes, the area is considered highly seismic.<ref name="o691"/> The total area of green space is 205,000 m<sup>2</sup>, of which 87,000 m<sup>2</sup> are [[Bogor Botanical Gardens]], 19,400 m<sup>2</sup> are taken by 35 parks, 17,200 m<sup>2</sup> by 24 groves and 81,400 m<sup>2</sup> are covered with grass.<ref name="Hijau"/>

Several rivers flow through the city toward the [[Java Sea]]. The largest ones, Ciliwung and Cisadane, flank the historic city center. Smaller rivers, Cipakancilan, Cidepit, Ciparigi and Cibalok, are guided by cement tubes in many places.<ref name="o691"/> It is worth noting that "ci" in the river names merely means "river" in Sundanese, and the actual name begins after it, but the "ci" is nevertheless included in national and international maps. There are several small lakes within the city, including Situ Burung (lit. Bird Lake; "Situ" meaning "Lake") and Situ Gede (lit. Great Lake), each with an area of several hectares. Rivers and lakes occupy 2.89% of the city area.<ref name="o694-3"/>

===Climate===
Bogor has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] (Af) according to the [[Köppen climate classification]],<ref name="ClimateData.org">{{Cite web|url=https://en.climate-data.org/asia/indonesia/west-java/bogor-3930/|title=Bogor climate: Average Temperature, weather by month, Bogor weather averages|website=en.climate-data.org|access-date=26 November 2021|archive-date=6 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706075452/https://en.climate-data.org/location/3930/|url-status=live}}</ref> and more humid and rainy than in many other areas of West Java – the average [[relative humidity]] is 70%,<ref name="o691"/> the average annual precipitation is about 1700&nbsp;mm, but more than 3500&nbsp;mm in some areas.<ref name="o691"/> Most rain falls between December and February. Because of this weather, Bogor has the nickname "Rain City" ({{langx|id|Kota hujan}}).<ref name="Bogor Raya"/><ref name="Kota Hujan"/> The temperatures are lower than in coastal Java: the average maximum is 25.9&nbsp;°C (cf. 32.2&nbsp;°C in Jakarta). Daily fluctuations (9–10&nbsp;°C) are rather high for Indonesia. The absolute maximum temperature was recorded at 38&nbsp;°C and the minimum at 3&nbsp;°C.<ref name="o148"/>

===Administration===
The city is headed by a mayor, who is elected by the citizens every five years, together with a vice-mayor; in the past, the mayor was appointed by the provincial administration.<ref name = "UU32-2004"/> [[Diani Budiarto]] became the first directly elected mayor of Bogor on 25 October 2008 and assumed his position on 7 April 2009.<ref name="o484"/> Legislative power is provided by the [[Bogor City Regional House of Representatives]] which consists of 50 directly elected members serving 5-year terms.<ref>{{cite news |title=Resmi Ditetapkan, Berikut Daftar 50 Anggota DPRD Kota Bogor Periode 2019-2024 |url=https://www.radarbogor.id/2019/08/13/resmi-ditetapkan-berikut-daftar-50-anggota-dprd-kota-bogor-periode-2019-2024/ |access-date=1 November 2023 |work=Radar Bogor |date=13 August 2019 |language=id}}</ref>
The Coat of arms of Bogor is a rectangular [[heraldic shield]] with a pointed base and the side lengths ratio of 5:4, divided by a cross into four parts. The upper left quarter contains the [[National emblem of Indonesia]] – the mythical bird [[Garuda]], in the upper right is the presidential palace, in the bottom left is the Salak volcano, and in the lower right is the national Sundanese [[dagger]] ''[[Kujang (weapon)|kujang]]''. The inscription on top reads "KOTA BOGOR", which translates to "THE CITY OF BOGOR".<ref name="o146"/>

==Economy==
Bogor has developed [[automotive industry|automotive]], [[Chemical industry|chemical]], and food industries;<ref name="o693"/> its outlying areas are used for agriculture.<ref name="BPPT-Pertanian"/> During the colonization, Bogor was mostly producing coffee, rubber and high-quality timber. Chemical industry was introduced to the city at the end of the 19th century,<ref name="cikalbogor2"/><ref name="theyo"/> and car and metal production in the 1950s, during the industrialization of independent Indonesia. The fast economic development of the 1980s was slowed down by the crisis of the 1990s and recovered in the early 2000s; so the growth rate of the economy in Bogor was 5.78% in 2002, 6.07% in 2003 and 6.02% in 2009.<ref name="o693"/> At the end of 2009, the [[Gross Regional Product]] (GRP) was 12.249 trillion [[Indonesian Rupiah|IDR]]<ref name="Svezhie ekonomdannye"/> (approximately US$1.287 billion<ref name="exchange"/>) and the investments amounted to 932.295 billion IDR.<ref name = "Svezhie ekonomdannye"/>

Despite the economic growth, the number of citizens living below the poverty level (defined by not only income, but also access to basic social services<ref name="o771-20"/>) is increasing, primarily due to the inflow of poor residents from the surrounding rural areas. In 2009, 17.45% of the population lived below the poverty level, almost twice as high than in 2006 (9.5%)<ref name="Svezhie ekonomdannye"/> [[Minimum wage]] is established by the West Java Governor at 2,658,155 IDR/month.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://regional.kompas.com/read/xml/2014/11/22/07020041/Ini.UMK.Jawa.Barat.2015|title=Ini UMK Jawa Barat 2015|first=Kompas Cyber|last=Media|date=22 November 2014|website=KOMPAS.com|access-date=26 November 2021|archive-date=9 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230409233146/https://regional.kompas.com/read/2014/11/22/07020041/Ini.UMK.Jawa.Barat.2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2008 there were 3,208 officially registered industrial enterprises in Bogor employing 54,268 people, more than half (32,237) of whom worked at the 114 largest companies.<ref name="BPPT-Industri"/> The outskirts of the city contain about 3,466 hectares of agricultural area, including 111 hectares of water bodies used for fishery and fish farming.<ref name="BPPT-Pertanian"/> The main crops are rice (1165 hectares as of 2007, the annual harvest in 2003 was 9,953 tonnes), various vegetables (772 acres, 8,296 tonnes), corn (382 acres, 6,720 tonnes) and [[sweet potato]] (480 acres, 3,480 tonnes).<ref name="Urozhay"/> The livestock sector has 25 registered companies (as of 2007) mostly breeding cows (more than 1000 animals yielding more than 2.61 million liters of milk), sheep (about 12,000), chickens (more than 642,000) and ducks (ca. 8,000).<ref name="o771-15"/><ref name="o771-16"/>

About 25–30 tonnes of various species of fish are produced per year by 4 registered companies. The fishes are mostly bred artificially, in ponds and paddy fields.<ref name="o771-17"/> Breeding [[aquarium fish]] and also catching them in their natural habitat is an important industry sector, which yielded US$367,000 from 2008 export sales only, mostly to Japan and Middle East.<ref name = "Ade"/> A substantial part of other Bogor production, 144 billion IDR in 2008, is exported. Examples are clothes and footwear (to US, EU, [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations East Asia|ASEAN]], Canada, Australia, Russia), textiles (US, [[New Zealand]]), furniture (South Korea), car tires (ASEAN countries and South America), toys and souvenirs (Japan, Germany, Brazil), soft drinks (ASEAN countries and Middle East).<ref name="BPPT-Perdagangan"/><ref name ="o698"/> Most of the local sells are carried out via the eight major shopping centers, nine supermarkets and seven major markets.<ref name="BPPT-Perdagangan"/>

==Transport==
[[File:Bogor Station Portico 2022.jpg|thumb|Facade of [[Bogor railway station|Bogor Station]]]]
Bogor is a major transport center of Java. It contains 599.2 kilometers of roads (as of 2008) which cover 5.31% of the city area; 30.2 kilometers of the roads are of national and 26.8&nbsp;km of prefectural importance.<ref name="BPPT-Prasarana"/> The 22 transport lines are operated by 3,506 buses and minibuses. In addition, 10 bus routes connect the city with the nearest metropolitan area (4,612 buses) and 40 with other cities of West Java (330 buses).<ref name="o151-8"/>

There are two major bus terminals, Baranangsiang and Bubulak. The former has an area of 22,100 m<sup>2</sup> and is dedicated to long-distance and freight traffic while the latter (area 11,850 m<sup>2</sup>) serves urban passenger routes.<ref name="o151-9"/> A separate station is dedicated to tourist coaches and buses to the nearest [[Soekarno–Hatta International Airport]] in Jakarta, located about 55 kilometers from Bogor.<ref name="o151-9"/> Recent years have seen a significant increase in the number of traditional Indonesian [[Cycle rickshaw|rickshaw]] (''becak'') at more than 2,000 units as of 2009.<ref name = "becak"/> The [[Bogor railway station]] was built in 1881, and currently serves about 50,000 passengers and has about 70 departures and 70 arrivals per day.<ref name="o151-9"/> The [[Bogor Paledang railway station]] opened in 2013 to serve trains to [[Sukabumi]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.republika.co.id/berita/nasional/jawa-barat-nasional/13/11/10/mw1tph-pt-kereta-api-aktifkan-kembali-ka-bogorsukabumi |title=PT Kereta Api Aktifkan Kembali KA Bogor-Sukabumi |date=10 November 2013 |work=Republika Online |access-date=29 May 2018 |language=id |archive-date=29 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180529203622/http://www.republika.co.id/berita/nasional/jawa-barat-nasional/13/11/10/mw1tph-pt-kereta-api-aktifkan-kembali-ka-bogorsukabumi |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Housing and facilities==
Residential buildings occupy 26.46% of the city, or 71.11% of its built-up area; 5–14-storey buildings dominate the central part and the outlying areas are mostly built up with single-storeyed houses.<ref name="RSS"/><ref name="Bappeda"/> The population rise in the 1990s–2000s due to the inflow of external workforce sharply increased the number of substandard housing, mainly on the outskirts of the city. More than half of the slums (1,242,490 m<sup>2</sup>) are located in northern Bogor, whereas their area is only 89,780 m<sup>2</sup> in the southern part of the city.<ref name="Bappeda"/><ref name="Kumuh"/> To improve this situation, the city administration launched a program of construction of cheap housing types (light prefabricated houses) in western Bogor. These houses combine reasonable rent ($22 per year<ref name="Svezhy kurs"/>) at acceptable living conditions.<ref name="RSS"/>

Electricity to Bogor is supplied by the Indonesian state company Perusahaan Listrik Negara, which serves the provinces of West Java and [[Banten]]. Electricity is provided by more than ten regional thermal and hydroelectric power plants via two local transformer stations located in the Bogor districts of Cimahpar and Cibilong.<ref name = "PLN"/> Whereas most of the houses (excluding some slum areas) are provided with electricity, street lighting covers only 35.38% of the city (4,193 light sources, as of 2007), however, the number of street lights is increasing at an annual rate of 10–15%.<ref name="Lampu Jalan"/>

As of 2009, only 47% of Bogor is provided with clean tap water through a centralized water supply systems managed by state-owned Tirta Pakuan.<ref name="PDAM"/> The municipal system takes water from rivers Cisadane (1240 liters per second), and three natural sources: Kota Batu, Bentar-Kambing and Tangka (410 liters per second). Although the water network has a total length of 741 kilometers and covers about 70% of the city, connection to it is often problematic for financial and technical reasons. More than half of residents use water wells or natural reservoirs.<ref name="PDAM"/>
