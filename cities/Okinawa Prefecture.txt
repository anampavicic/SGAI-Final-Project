Okinawa Prefecture's largest island, [[Okinawa Island]], is the home to a majority of Okinawa's population. Okinawa's indigenous ethnic group is the [[Ryukyuan people]], who also live in the [[Amami Islands]] of [[Kagoshima Prefecture]].

Okinawa was ruled by the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]] from 1429 and unofficially annexed by Japan after the [[Invasion of Ryukyu]] in 1609. Okinawa was officially founded in 1879 by the [[Empire of Japan]] after seven years as the [[Ryukyu Domain]], the last domain of the [[Han system]]. Okinawa was occupied by the United States during the Allied [[occupation of Japan]] after [[World War II]] and was governed by the [[United States Military Government of the Ryukyu Islands|Military Government of the Ryukyu Islands]] from 1945 to 1950 and [[United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands|Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands]] from 1950 until the prefecture was returned to Japan in 1972. Okinawa comprises just 0.6 percent of Japan's total land mass, but about 26,000 (75%) of [[United States Forces Japan]] personnel are assigned to the prefecture; the continued [[United States Forces Japan#United States presence debate|U.S. military presence in Okinawa]] is controversial.<ref>{{citation|last=Inoue|first=Masamichi S.|title=Okinawa and the U.S. Military: Identity Making in the Age of Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TnsVoSw8hRgC|year=2017|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-51114-8|access-date=February 12, 2017|archive-date=February 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217032309/https://books.google.com/books?id=TnsVoSw8hRgC|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/06/26/national/crime-legal/u-s-civilian-arrested-fresh-okinawa-dui-case-man-injured/#.V54kfSOLTZs|title=U.S. civilian arrested in fresh Okinawa DUI case; man injured|website=The Japan Times|date=June 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731204831/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/06/26/national/crime-legal/u-s-civilian-arrested-fresh-okinawa-dui-case-man-injured/|archive-date=July 31, 2017|quote=Under a decades-old security alliance, Okinawa hosts about 26,000 U.S. service personnel, more than half the total Washington keeps in all of Japan, in addition to base workers and family members.}}</ref>

Also during this period, many [[Gusuku]]s, similar to castles, were constructed. The Ryukyu Kingdom entered into the [[Tributary system of China|Imperial Chinese tributary system]] under the [[Ming dynasty]] beginning in the 15th century, which established economic relations between the two nations.

In 1609, the [[Shimazu clan]], which controlled the region that is now [[Kagoshima Prefecture]], [[Invasion of Ryukyu|invaded the Ryukyu Kingdom]]. The Ryukyu Kingdom was obliged to agree to form a [[Suzerainty|suzerain]]-[[vassal]] relationship with the [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] and the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], while maintaining its previous role within the Chinese tributary system; Ryukyuan sovereignty was maintained since complete annexation would have created a conflict with China. The Satsuma clan earned considerable profits from trade with China during a period in which foreign trade was heavily restricted by the shogunate. Although Satsuma maintained strong influence over the islands, the Ryukyu Kingdom maintained a considerable degree of domestic political freedom for over two hundred years.

Four years after the 1868 [[Meiji Restoration]], the Japanese government, through military incursions, officially annexed the kingdom and renamed it Ryukyu [[Han system|han]]. At the time, the [[Qing dynasty]] asserted a nominal suzerainty over the islands. Ryukyu han became Okinawa Prefecture of Japan in 1879, even though all other hans had become prefectures of Japan in 1872. In 1912, Okinawans first obtained the right to vote for representatives to the {{Nihongo|[[National Diet]]|国会}} which had been established in 1890.<ref>Steve Rabson, "Meiji Assimilation Policy in Okinawa: Promotion, Resistance, and "Reconstruction" in ''New Directions in the Study of Meiji Japan'' ([[Helen Hardacre]], ed.). Brill, 1997. p. 642.</ref>

===1945–1965===
On 1 April 1945, the [[US Army|U.S. Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] launched an [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion of Okinawa]] with 185,000 troops. They were faced with fanatical resistance from the Japanese defenders. A third of Okinawa's civilian population were killed during the ensuing fighting.<ref name="economist">{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5097132 | newspaper=[[The Economist]] | title=No home where the dugong roam | date=October 27, 2005 | quote=some of the bloodiest campaigns anywhere in the second world war were fought in Okinawa, and a third of the civilian population died. | access-date=September 7, 2006 | archive-date=September 5, 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905210944/http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5097132 | url-status=live }}</ref> The dead, of all nationalities, are commemorated at the [[Cornerstone of Peace]].

After the end of World War II, the United States set up the United States [[United States Military Government of the Ryukyu Islands|Military Government of the Ryukyu Islands]] administration, which ruled Okinawa for 27 years. During this "trusteeship rule", the United States established numerous military bases on the Ryukyu islands. The [[Ryukyu independence movement]] was an Okinawan movement that clamored against U.S. rule.

====Continued U.S. military buildup====
During the [[Korean War]], [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 Superfortresses]] flew bombing missions over Korea from [[Kadena Air Base]] on Okinawa. The military buildup on the island during the [[Cold War]] increased a division between local inhabitants and the American military. Under the 1952 [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan]], [[United States Forces Japan]] (USFJ) have maintained a large military presence.
 
During the mid-1950s, the U.S. seized land from Okinawans to build new bases or expand currently existing ones. According to the Melvin Price Report, by 1955, the military had displaced 250,000 residents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ryukyu-okinawa.net/pages/archive/price.html|title=The Melvin Price Report|last=Special Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, House of Representatives|date=1955|website=via Ryukyu-Okinawa History and Culture Website|access-date=May 23, 2019|archive-date=August 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806025243/http://ryukyu-okinawa.net/pages/archive/price.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Secret U.S. deployment of nuclear weapons====
Since 1960, the U.S. and Japan have maintained an agreement that allows the U.S. to secretly bring nuclear weapons into Japanese ports.<ref name="NHK01">{{cite web |url= http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/japan/okinawa/okinawa.htm |title= Revelations in Newly Released Documents about U.S. Nuclear Weapons and Okinawa Fuel; NHK Documentary |date= May 14, 1997 |first= Robert A. |last= Wampler |website=George Washington University |access-date= February 11, 2018 |archive-date= January 16, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130116025521/http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/japan/okinawa/okinawa.htm |url-status= live }}</ref><ref name="NHK02">{{cite web |title= Memorandum, Ambassador Brown to Secretary Rogers, 4/29/69, Subject: NSC Meeting April 30 - Policy Toward Japan: Briefing Memorandum (Secret), with attached |website=George Washington University |page= 1 |url= https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//japan/okinawa/oki1_a.htm |date= April 30, 1969 |access-date= February 11, 2018 |archive-date= February 13, 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180213021557/https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//japan/okinawa/oki1_a.htm |url-status= live }}</ref><ref name="NHK03">{{cite web |title= NSSM 5 - Japan, Table of Contents and Part III: Okinawa Reversion (Secret) |website=George Washington University |page= 22|url= https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//japan/okinawa/oki3_f.htm|year= 1969|access-date= February 11, 2018|archive-date= August 25, 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170825014344/http://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/japan/okinawa/oki3_f.htm|url-status= live}}</ref> The Japanese people tended to oppose the introduction of nuclear arms into Japanese territory<ref name="NHK04">{{cite web |title= Memorandum of Conversation, Nixon/Sato, 11/19/69 (Top Secret/Sensitive) |website=George Washington University |page= 2|url= https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//japan/okinawa/oki5_b.htm|date= November 19, 1969|access-date= February 11, 2018|archive-date= August 25, 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170825011212/http://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/japan/okinawa/oki5_b.htm|url-status= live}}</ref> and the Japanese government's assertion of [[Japan's non-nuclear weapons policy|Japan's non-nuclear policy]] and a statement of the [[Three Non-Nuclear Principles]] reflected this popular opposition.

===1965–1972 (Vietnam War)===
Between 1965 and 1972, Okinawa was a key staging point for United States in its military operations directed towards North Vietnam. Along with Guam, it presented a geographically strategic launch pad for covert bombing missions over Cambodia and Laos.<ref>John Morrocco. Rain of Fire. (United States: Boston Publishing Company), pg 14</ref> Anti-[[Vietnam War]] sentiment became linked politically to the movement for reversion of Okinawa to Japan. In 1965, the U.S. military bases, earlier viewed as paternal post war protection, were increasingly seen as aggressive. The Vietnam War highlighted the differences between United States and Okinawa but showed a commonality between the islands and mainland Japan.<ref name="NYT65">{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Trumbull|newspaper=The New York Times|title=OKINAWA B-52'S ANGER JAPANESE: Bombing of Vietnam From Island Stirs Public Outcry.|date=August 1, 1965|url=http://0-www.proquest.com.mercury.concordia.ca/|access-date=September 27, 2009|archive-date=December 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209143838/http://0-www.proquest.com.mercury.concordia.ca/|url-status=live}}</ref>

As controversy grew regarding the alleged placement of nuclear weapons on Okinawa, fears intensified over the escalation of the Vietnam War. Okinawa was perceived by some inside Japan as a potential target for China, should the communist government feel threatened by United States.<ref>Mori, Kyozo, Two Ends of a Telescope Japanese and American Views of Okinawa, Japan Quarterly, 15:1 (1968:Jan./Mar.) p.17</ref> American military secrecy blocked any local reporting on what was actually occurring at bases such as Kadena Air Base. As information leaked out, and images of air strikes were published, the local population began to fear the potential for retaliation.<ref name="NYT65" />

Political leaders such as [[Makoto Oda]], a major figure in the [[Beheiren]] movement (Foundation of Citizens for Peace in Vietnam), believed that the return of Okinawa to Japan would lead to the removal of U.S. forces, ending Japan's involvement in Vietnam.<ref name="Havens, T.

The movement employed tactics ranging from demonstrations to handing leaflets to soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines directly, warning of the implications for a third World War.<ref>Havens, T. R.

The U.S. military bases on Okinawa became a focal point for [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War]] sentiment. By 1969, over 50,000 American military personnel were stationed on Okinawa.<ref>Christopher T.

In 1969, chemicals leaked from the U.S. storage depot at Chibana in central Okinawa, under [[Operation Red Hat]]. Evacuations of residents took place over a wide area for two months.

===Geology===
The island is largely composed of [[coral]], and rainwater filtering through that coral has given the island many caves, which played an important role in the Battle of Okinawa.

===Climate===
The island experiences temperatures above {{convert|20|C}} for most of the year. The climate of the islands ranges from [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa'') in the north, such as [[Okinawa Island]], to [[tropical rainforest climate]] (Köppen climate classification ''Af'') in the south such as [[Iriomote Island]]. Snowfall is unheard of at sea level. However, on January 24, 2016, sleet was reported in Nago for the first time on record.<ref>{{cite news |date=January 25, 2016 |title=沖縄本島で観測史上初のみぞれ 名護 |url=http://www.asahi.com/articles/ASJ1T0352J1SUEHF00F.html |newspaper=The Asahi Shimbun Company |access-date=February 20, 2016 |archive-date=February 27, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227142117/http://www.asahi.com/articles/ASJ1T0352J1SUEHF00F.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The overall ethnic identity of Okinawa residents is rather split. According to a telephone poll conducted by Lim John Chuan-tiong (林泉忠), an associate professor with the [[University of the Ryukyus]], 40.6% of respondents identified as "{{Nihongo2|沖縄人}} (Okinawan)", 21.3% identified as "{{Nihongo2|日本人}} (Japanese)" and 36.5% identified as both.<ref>{{Cite web |date=21 December 2023 |title=Identity Survey of Okinawan Residents |url=http://questionnaire.blog16.fc2.com/blog-entry-416.html |access-date=25 May 2023 |website=FC2}}</ref>{{Self-published inline|date=May 2023}}

==Language and culture==

Having been a separate nation until 1879, Okinawan language and culture differ in many ways from those of mainland Japan.

===Language===
There remain six [[Ryukyuan languages]] which, although related, are incomprehensible to speakers of [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. [[Amami Ōshima language|One of the Ryukyuan languages]] is spoken in [[Kagoshima Prefecture]], rather than in Okinawa Prefecture. These languages are in decline as the younger generation of Okinawans uses Standard Japanese. Mainland Japanese and some Okinawans generally perceive the Ryukyuan languages as "dialects". Standard Japanese is almost always used in formal situations. In informal situations, ''de facto'' everyday language among Okinawans under age 60 is Okinawa-accented mainland Japanese ("[[Okinawan Japanese]]"), which is often mistaken by non-Okinawans as the Okinawan language proper. The actual traditional Okinawan language is still used in traditional cultural activities, such as [[Okinawan music|folk music]] and [[Kumi Odori|folk dance]]. There is a radio-news program in the language as well.<ref>

</ref>

===Religion===
{{main|Ryukyuan religion}}
Okinawans have traditionally followed Ryukyuan religious beliefs, generally characterized by [[ancestor worship]] and the respecting of relationships between the living, the dead, and the gods and spirits of the natural world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sitereports.nabunken.go.jp/15945|title=陶磁器から古の神事（祭祀・儀式）を考える|last=Okinawa Prefectural reserve cultural assets center|date=2006|website=Comprehensive Database of Archaeological Site Reports in Japan|access-date=September 2, 2016|archive-date=July 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728031104/https://sitereports.nabunken.go.jp/en/15945|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Culture===
Okinawan culture bears traces of its various trading partners. One can find [[Chinese Culture|Chinese]], [[Culture of Thailand|Thai]] and [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] influences in the island's customs. Perhaps Okinawa's most famous cultural export is [[karate]], probably a product of the close ties with and influence of China on Okinawan culture. Karate is thought to be a synthesis of Chinese [[kung fu]] with traditional Okinawan martial arts.

A traditional Okinawan product that owes its existence to Okinawa's trading history is [[awamori]]—an Okinawan distilled spirit made from ''indica'' rice imported from [[Thailand]].

Other prominent examples of Okinawan culture include the [[sanshin]]—a three-stringed Okinawan instrument, closely related to the Chinese [[sanxian]], and ancestor of the Japanese [[shamisen]], somewhat similar to a [[banjo]]. Its body is often bound with snakeskin (from [[Pythonidae|pythons]], imported from elsewhere in Asia, rather than from Okinawa's venomous [[Trimeresurus flavoviridis]], which are too small for this purpose). Okinawan culture also features the [[Eisa (dance)|eisa dance]], a traditional drumming dance. A traditional craft, the fabric named [[bingata]], is made in workshops on the main island and elsewhere.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Trimillos|first=Ricardo D.|date=2009|title=Reviewed Work: ''Drumming Out a Message: Eisa and the Okinawan Diaspora'' Yoshitaka Terada |journal=Asian Music|volume=40|issue=2|pages=161–165|doi=10.1353/amu.0.0035|jstor=25652439|s2cid=191601292|issn=0044-9202}}</ref>

The [[Okinawa diet|Okinawan diet]] consists of low-fat, low-salt foods, such as whole fruits and vegetables, legumes, tofu, and seaweed. Okinawans are particularly well known for consuming purple potatoes, also known as Okinawan sweet potatoes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.downtoearth.org/health/nutrition/okinawan-sweet-potato-purple-powerhouse-nutrition|title=The Okinawan Sweet Potato: A Purple Powerhouse of Nutrition|last=Earth|first=Down to|date=November 11, 2011|website=Down to Earth Organic and Natural|language=en|access-date=October 7, 2019|archive-date=August 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806033443/https://www.downtoearth.org/health/nutrition/okinawan-sweet-potato-purple-powerhouse-nutrition|url-status=live}}</ref> Okinawans used to be known for their [[longevity]] compared to the rest of Japan and the world in general. This particular island is a so-called [[Blue Zone]], an area where people are purported to live longer than most others elsewhere in the world. Possible explanations for this were diet, low-stress lifestyle, caring community, activity, and spirituality of the inhabitants of the island.<ref name="Santrock">{{cite book|author=Santrock, John W. A|title= Topical Approach to Life-Span Development|url=https://archive.org/details/topicalapproacht00john_0|url-access=registration|edition=4|location=New York|publisher= McGraw-Hill|year= 2002}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2014}}

A cultural feature of the Okinawans is the forming of [[Moai (social support groups)|''moais'']]. A {{Nihongo3|||moai}} is a community social gathering and groups that come together to provide financial and emotional support through emotional bonding, advice giving, and social funding. This provides a sense of security for the community members and as mentioned in the Blue Zone studies, may have been a contributing factor to the longevity of its people.<ref>{{cite web|title=Okinawa's Longevity Lessons|url=https://www.bluezones.com/2014/03/okinawas-longevity-lessons/|website=Blue Zones|publisher=Admin|access-date=September 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001104107/https://www.bluezones.com/2014/03/okinawas-longevity-lessons/|archive-date=October 1, 2015}}</ref> However, in recent decades Okinawans' life expectancy has fallen significantly (also bringing into question the general validity of the 'Blue Zones' denominaton), which often has been blamed on cultural influence from the rest of Japan, as well as foreign influences on Okinawans' lifestyle.<ref>{{cite web|title=Japan: What's behind Okinawans' falling life expectancy?|url=https://www.dw.com/en/japan-whats-behind-okinawans-falling-life-expectancy/a-62088176|website=DW|access-date=April 16, 2024}}</ref>

Two Okinawan writers have received the [[Akutagawa Prize]]: [[Eiki Matayoshi]] in 1995 for {{Nihongo|''The Pig's Retribution''|豚の報い|Buta no mukui}} and [[Shun Medoruma]] in 1997 for ''A Drop of Water'' (''Suiteki''). The prize was also won by Okinawans in 1967 by [[Tatsuhiro Oshiro]] for ''Cocktail Party'' ({{Nihongo3|||Kakuteru Pāti}}) and in 1971 by [[Mineo Higashi]] for ''Okinawan Boy'' ({{Nihongo3|||Okinawa no Shōnen}}).<ref name="O-times">{{cite news|url=http://www.okinawatimes.co.jp/summit/english/2000/20000721_6.html |title=Okinawa Writers Excel in Literature|date=July 21, 2000|work=The Okinawa Times|publisher=Okinawa Times|access-date=September 3, 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20000823030320/http://www.okinawatimes.co.jp/summit/english/2000/20000721_6.html |archive-date = August 23, 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bunshun.co.jp/award/akutagawa/list1.htm|script-title=ja:芥川賞受賞者一覧|year=2009|publisher=Bungeishunju Ltd.|language=ja|access-date=September 3, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213000347/http://www.bunshun.co.jp/award/akutagawa/list1.htm|archive-date=February 13, 2008}}</ref>

===Karate===
[[Karate]] originated in Okinawa. Over time, it developed into several styles and sub-styles. On Okinawa, the three main styles are considered to be [[Shōrin-ryū]], [[Gōjū-ryū]] and [[Uechi-ryū]]. Internationally, the various styles and sub-styles include [[Matsubayashi-ryū]], [[Wadō-ryū]], [[Isshin-ryū]], [[Shōrinkan]], [[Shotokan]], [[Shitō-ryū]], [[Shōrinjiryū Kenkōkan Karate|Shōrinjiryū Kenkōkan]], Shorinjiryu Koshinkai, and [[Shōrinji-ryū]].

[[File:Naha Shuri Castle20s5s3200.jpg|thumb|right|[[Shuri Castle]] in Naha]]

Despite widespread destruction during World War II, there are many remains of a unique type of castle or fortress known as ''[[gusuku]]''; the most [[Values (heritage)|significant]] are inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List ([[Gusuku Sites and Related Properties of the Kingdom of Ryukyu]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/972/ |title=Gusuku Sites and Related Properties of the Kingdom of Ryukyu |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |access-date=May 29, 2012 |archive-date=May 13, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513102456/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/972 |url-status=live }}</ref> In addition, [[List of Cultural Properties of Japan - structures (Okinawa)|twenty-three Ryukyuan architectural complexes]] and [[List of Historic Sites of Japan (Okinawa)|forty historic sites]] have been [[Cultural Property (Japan)|designated for protection]] by the national government.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kunishitei.bunka.go.jp/bsys/index_pc.asp |title=Database of National Cultural Properties: 国宝・重要文化財 (建造物): 沖縄県 |language=ja |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |access-date=June 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190722215103/https://kunishitei.bunka.go.jp/bsys/index_pc.asp |archive-date=July 22, 2019 }}</ref> [[Shuri Castle]] in Naha is an [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

Whereas most [[Housing in Japan|homes in Japan]] are made from wood and allow free-flow of air to combat humidity, typical modern homes in Okinawa are made from concrete with barred windows to protect from flying plant debris and to withstand regular [[typhoon]]s. Roofs are designed with strong winds in mind, in which each tile is cemented on and not merely layered as seen with many homes in Japan.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The Nakamura House ([[:ja:中村家住宅 (沖縄県)]]) is an original 18th century farmhouse in Kitanakagusuki. Many roofs also display a lion-dog statue, called a ''[[shisa]]'', which is said to protect the home from danger. Roofs are typically red in color and are inspired by Chinese design.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Chinese and Japanese Influence In Ryukyuan Architecture - Okinawa Prefecture|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/the-chinese-and-japanese-influence-in-ryukyuan-architecture/ZwLild7YMwcxIg|access-date=July 21, 2021|website=Google Arts & Culture|language=en|archive-date=July 21, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210721185501/https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/the-chinese-and-japanese-influence-in-ryukyuan-architecture/ZwLild7YMwcxIg|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Education==
The public schools in Okinawa are overseen by the [[Okinawa Prefectural Board of Education]].
