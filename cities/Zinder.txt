'''Zinder''' (locally, ''Damagaram''), formerly also spelled '''Sinder''', is the third largest city in [[Niger]], with a population of 235,605 as by the 2012 census.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://citypopulation.de/Niger-Cities.html|title=Niger: Regions, Cities & Urban Centers - Population Statistics, Maps, Charts, Weather and Web Information}}</ref> It is situated {{convert|861|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of the capital [[Niamey]] and {{convert|240|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the Nigerian city of [[Kano (city)|Kano]].

==History==

===Early history===
{{see also|Sultanate of Damagaram}}
[[File:Photo1906 Zinder overview.jpg|thumb|Zinder in 1906]]
Zinder was originally the site of the small [[Hausa people|Hausa]] village of Zengou.<ref name="Bradt">Geels, Jolijn, (2006) ''Bradt Travel Guide - Niger'', pgs. 213-26</ref> The town grew dramatically in importance following the arrival of [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] aristocrats in 1736, who built a new fortified quarter called Birni to the south and declared the town of Zinder as the capital of the [[Sultanate of Damagaram]] in 1736.<ref name="Bradt"/> Thereafter Zinder became an important centre of the [[Trans-Saharan trade]] and a major hub for trade south through [[Kano (city)|Kano]] and east to [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]].<ref name=eb>"{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Zinder |volume=28 |page=985}}</ref> The sultanate remained nominally subject to the [[Borno Empire]] until the reign of Sultan Tanimoune Dan Souleymane in the mid-to-late 19th century, who declared independence and initiated a phase of vigorous expansion.<ref name="Bradt"/>

Europeans began exploring the region in the 19th century, beginning with German explorer [[Heinrich Barth]], who stayed in Zinder in 1851, and later the [[French Third Republic|French]] explorer [[Marius Gabriel Cazemajou]], who was killed in the city in 1897.<ref name="Bradt"/> It was then, after a brief resistance, occupied in July 1899 by Lt.&nbsp;Pallier of the [[Voulet-Chanoine mission]]. The French barracks was called '''Fort&nbsp;Cazemajou'''<ref name=eb/> and it served as the capital of the Niger Military Territory upon its creation in 1911. In 1926, following fears of Hausa revolts and improving relations with the [[Zarma people|Djerma]] of the west, the capital was transferred back to the village of [[Niamey]].<ref name="Bradt"/>

Upon Niger's independence from France, the town's fort was renamed for Sultane Tanimoune.

===Recent history===
In 2003, telecommunications company [[Celtel]] arrived in Zinder, building a mobile phone tower and selling prepaid phone cards to residents. This arrival of the mobile phone drastically changed the predominant modes of communication in the city, allowing traders to have a faster and more affordable means of communicating with buyers and sellers. This is an example of how cellular towers in the developing world have begun to transform the market.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything |last=Saylor |first=Michael |year=2012 |publisher=Perseus Books/Vanguard Press |isbn=978-1593157203 |page=191 }}</ref>

In September 2024, the [[Zinder Mosque]], one of Niger's oldest mosques and a significant cultural and religious site in the city, collapsed due to intense rainfall.<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 4, 2024 |title=Historic mosque in Niger destroyed by torrential rains |url=https://www.trtworld.com/africa/historic-mosque-in-niger-destroyed-by-torrential-rains-18203867 |access-date=2024-09-16 |website=[[TRT World]] |language=en}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Zinder-du ciel.jpg|thumb|Zinder from the sky]]
[[File:Zinder (6328132791).jpg|thumb|right|The Sultan's Palace]]
The centre of Zinder consists of three main areas: in the north is ''Zengou or Zango'', the old [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] suburb,<ref name=eb/> is known for its [[vernacular architecture]], and in the south lies ''Birni'', the old [[Hausa people|Hausa]] town, which is home to Zinder Great Mosque, Fort Tanimoune and the Sultan's Palace, as well as a museum. ''Sabon Gari'' (the new town), lies between Birni and Zengou,  and is the commercial centre, known for its large market (the ''Grand Marché''). The city now sprawls to the north and west, extending to the Karkada section, in the north; other neighbourhoods include Garin Mallam and Gawon Kollia.

The city has many distinctive granite rocks which can result in standing water during the rainy season,{{clarify|date=February 2016}} though the city has a long history of water shortages. Recently water was piped by a Chinese-owned company from the north to provide water to most of the city, however, this problem is likely to continue due to expected population growth.{{cn|date=October 2019}} 

The city is divided into 5 urban municipalities: [[Zinder I]], [[Zinder II]], [[Zinder III]], [[Zinder IV]] and [[Zinder V]].<ref>[http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/den/Documents/code_rural/cdrom/doc%20pdf/Loi%20N%B02002-14%20cr%E9ation%20des%20communes.pdf Loi n° 2002-014 du 11 JUIN 2002 portant création des communes et fixant le nom de leurs chefs-lieux]. Includes list of 213 communes rurales and seats, 52 Communes urbaines and seats</ref>

== Demographics ==
{{Historical populations|1977|53,914|1988|119,827|2001|170,575|2012|235,605|align=none|footnote=source:<ref>[http://www.citypopulation.de/en/niger/cities/ Niger: Administrative Division population statistics]</ref>}}
The population of Zinder City has quadrupled from around 50,000 inhabitants in 1977 to over 200,000 people in 2012.

==Transport==
[[Zinder Airport]] (code: ZND) is located a few kilometres southwest of the town.<ref>[http://www.world-airport-codes.com/niger/zinder-7859.html Zinder (ZND) Niger: world-airport-codes.com]</ref>

==Economy==
The economy of the city is still largely based on the agricultural activities of the surroundings. Today, the city counts four officially recognised industries: Tannerie Malam Yaro (leather tanning), Gidan Alkaki (cake production), Sahara Sahel Foods (processing of [[non-wood forest produce]]) and [[SORAZ]] (petrol refinery located 50km North of the city). The latter is Niger Republic's first oil refinery, and was commissioned in November 2011.<ref name=schritt-2018>{{cite journal |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/000203971805300204 |title=Crude Moves: Oil, Power and Politics in Niger |last1=Schritt |first1=Jannik |last2=Schareika |first2=Nikolaus |journal=Africa Spectrum |volume=53 |issue=2 |year=2018 |access-date=21 May 2024}}</ref>
