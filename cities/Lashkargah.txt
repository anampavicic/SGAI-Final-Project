'''Lashkargāh''' ({{langx|ps|لښکرګاه}}; {{langx|fa|لشکرگاه}}), historically called '''Bost''' or '''Boost''' ({{lang|ps|بست، بوست}}), is a city in southwestern [[Afghanistan]] and the capital of [[Helmand Province]]. It is located in [[Lashkargah District]], where the [[Arghandab River]] merges into the [[Helmand River]]. The city has a population of 201,546 as of 2006.<ref name=demography>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrrd-nabdp.org/Provincial%20Profiles/Helmand%20PDP%20Provincial%20profile.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528073832/http://www.mrrd-nabdp.org/Provincial%2520Profiles/Helmand%2520PDP%2520Provincial%2520profile.pdf |url-status=usurped |archive-date=28 May 2019 |title=B.

It is mostly very arid and desolate. However, farming does exist around the Helmand and Arghandab rivers. [[Bost Airport]] is located on the east bank of the Helmand River, five miles north of the junction of the Helmand and Arghandab rivers. Because of the trading hubs, it is Afghanistan's second largest city in size, after Kabul and before Kandahar.

After several weeks of fighting in the [[Battle of Lashkargah]], the city was captured by the [[Taliban]] on 13 August 2021, becoming the fourteenth provincial capital to be seized by the Taliban as part of the wider [[2021 Taliban offensive]].<ref name="ReutersTalibanCapture">{{cite news |last1=Birsel |first1=Robert |title=Taliban capture Afghanistan's Lashkar Gah, capital of Helmand - police official |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/taliban-capture-afghanistans-lashkar-gah-capital-helmand-police-official-2021-08-13/ |access-date=13 August 2021 |work=Reuters |date=13 August 2021 |archive-date=13 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210813112441/https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/taliban-capture-afghanistans-lashkar-gah-capital-helmand-police-official-2021-08-13/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

== History ==
{{Further|History of Afghanistan}}
Lashkargah means "army barracks" in [[Persian language|Persian]]. The area was part of the [[Saffarids]] in the 9th century. It grew up a thousand years ago as a riverside barracks town for soldiers accompanying the [[Ghaznavid]] nobility to their grand winter capital of Bost. The ruins of the Ghaznavid mansions still stand along the [[Helmand River]]; the city of Bost and its outlying communities were sacked in successive centuries by the [[Ghorids]], [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], and [[Timurids]]. However, the region was later rebuilt by [[Timur]].

By the late 16th century the city and region was governed by the [[Safavid dynasty]]. It became part of the Afghan [[Hotaki dynasty|Hotaki Empire]] in 1709. It was invaded by the [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid]] forces in 1738 on their way to Kandahar. By 1747 it became part of the [[Durrani Empire]] or modern Afghanistan. The British arrived in or about 1840 during the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]] but left about year later. The city was used by [[Mohammad Ayub Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)|Ayub Khan]] in the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] until 1880 when the British helped return it to [[Abdur Rahman Khan]]. It remained peaceful for the next 100 years. 
[[File:Lashkargah - WideRoads.jpg|thumb|left|American designed street of Lashkargah.]]

The modern city of Lashkargah was used as a headquarters for [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] working on the [[Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority|Helmand Valley Authority]] (HVA) irrigation project in the 1950s, modeled after the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) in the United States. Lashkargah was built using American designs, with broad tree-lined streets and brick houses with no walls separating them from the street. In the wake of the Soviet invasion and the long [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|Afghan civil war]], the trees mostly came down and walls went up.

The massive Helmand irrigation project in the 1940s–1970s created one of the most extensive farming zones in southern Afghanistan, opening up many thousands of hectares of desert to human cultivation and habitation. The project focused on three large canals: the Boghra, Shamalan, and Darweshan. Responsibility for maintaining the canals was given to the [[Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority]] (HAVA), a semi-independent government agency whose authority (in its heyday) rivaled that of the provincial governors.

After the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan in 1989 and the collapse of [[Mohammad Najibullah]]'s government in 1992, the city was taken over by the Mujaheddin forces. In the mid-1990s it fell to the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (1996–2001)|Taliban government]]. In late 2001, the Taliban were removed from power by the [[United States armed forces]]. Since 2002, the city and region was occupied by [[United States Marine Corps]] and the [[International Security Assistance Force]]. In 2008, Taliban forces attacked the city heavily but the [[Afghan National Army]] and the [[Oregon Army National Guard]] managed to hold them back, as shown in the documentary, "[[Shepherds of Helmand]]." After training and equipping Afghan security forces, the foreign armies transferred security responsibility to the [[military of Afghanistan]] and [[Afghan National Police]] in 2011. The city has witnessed some fighting in the form of attacks orchestrated by the [[Taliban insurgency|Taliban insurgents]]. In October 2020, the Taliban attacked the city along with the nearby district of Nad Ali.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/world/asia/taliban-lashkar-gah-afghanistan.html |title=Taliban Test Afghan and U.S. Resolve in Talks by Attacking a City |first1=Mujib |last1=Mashal |first2=Taimoor |last2=Shah |date=12 October 2020 |access-date=6 August 2021 |newspaper=[[NY Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/19/5000-families-displaced-whats-going-on-in-southern-afghanistan |title=As violence flares in south Afghanistan, key questions answered |first=Shereena |last=Qazi |date=19 October 2020 |access-date=6 August 2021 |newspaper=[[Al Jazeera English|Al Jazeera]] |publisher=[[Al Jazeera Media Network]]}}</ref> Militants raised the flag of the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]] at the city's eastern entrance but withdrew following a few days once the United States agreed to halt its airstrikes on the Taliban near Lashkargah.

==Helmand River==
[[File:Boat Riding Lashkargah.JPG|thumb|Boat riding on the Helmand River. The riverside [[thicket]]s are located on the other side.]]
The [[Helmand River]] is the longest in Afghanistan with a length of 1,150&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gXEFVEApRgAC&pg=PA12 |title=Afghanistan in Pictures |first=Alison |last=Behnke |date=1 January 2003 |publisher=[[Twenty-First Century Books]] |page=12 |isbn=9780822546832}}</ref> The river originates in the [[Hindu Kush]] and ends in Hamun-i-Helmand in the [[Sistan and Baluchistan]] province of neighboring Iran. One of the two primary arms of the river crosses through Lashkargah, giving it the attractive air of a riverside city. It makes for a pleasant setting for the citizens of Lashkargah to picnic. The river is deep enough at Lashkargah to allow for varied water sports, including swimming and boating. Boats are available for rent to the public. [[Mirwais Hotak|Mirwais Neka Park]] was recently built on the banks of the river. There is a large thicket located on the opposite side of the river from the city. Many types of trees and different species of [[bird]]s, [[mammal]]s, and [[reptile]]s inhabit the thicket.

It is located near the convergence of the Helmand and [[Arghandab River]]s, a half-hour's drive south of Lashkargah. Qala-e-Bost is famous for its decorative arch, which appears on the 100 Afghani note (Afghan currency). As of April 2008, it was possible to descend into an ancient shaft about 20 feet across and 200 feet deep, with a series of dark side rooms and a spiral staircase leading to the bottom. In 2006 construction began on a cobblestone road to lead from the south of Lashkargah to the Qala-e-Bost Arch (known to readers of [[James A. Michener]]'s ''[[Caravans (novel)|Caravans]]'' as Qala Bist.)<ref>National Geographic – [http://photography.nationalgeographic.com/photography/enlarge/qala-e-bost-arch_pod_image.html Qala-E-Bost Arch, Afghanistan, 1968] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822025008/http://photography.nationalgeographic.com/photography/enlarge/qala-e-bost-arch_pod_image.html |date=22 August 2009 }}</ref>

==Education and media==
{{Further|Education in Afghanistan}}
[[File:LashkargahInstitute.jpg|thumb|Helmand Institute of Teacher's Training]]

==Recent developments{{when|date=August 2021}}==
{{update|section|date=August 2021}}

[[File:Peace Square Lashkar Gah.jpg|thumb|Peace Square]]
The city of Lashkargah has undergone large scale development in the past few years{{when|date=August 2021}} with new roads, markets and residential areas constructed. Many Afghans continue to leave their tribes and emigrate towards cities – such as Lashkargah. Government projects distributed land to the people, increasing the approximate size of the city. Modern architecture and building methods are more common, now, here than Mud squats and other more traditional Afghan architecture. The former Governor of Helmand province, [[Mohammad Gulab Mangal|Gulab Mangal]], funded large scale development of the city, the Governor's office and Justice Department have been recently renovated, new Police Headquarters and [[Eidgah]] have also been funded. Unlike much of Afghanistan the roads in Lashkargah are generally paved with asphalt. International Organizations and PRT in Lashkargah have helped to complete rehabilitation and infrastructure projects such as building: schools, roads and parks.

In 2005 it was announced that a [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]]-funded project would build six reservoirs in Lashkargah, with responsibility for the water supply then being handed over to the [[Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority]]. The city had been without fresh water for the previous 30 years due to the contamination of the [[Helmand River]].<ref>[http://reliefweb.int/node/170220 USAID Field Report Afghanistan Feb 2005] ReliefWeb</ref>

As part of [[Operation Moshtarak]] in 2010, the [[British Army]] and local workforces constructed [[Route Trident]], a road to connect Lashkargah and the northern, more developed city of [[Gereshk]],<ref>{{cite news|last=BBC News|title= Progress slow and messy in Afghanistan|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8483047.stm|access-date=3 September 2010|date=28 January 2010}}</ref>
Governor Mangal's efforts to restructure the city have left [[Route Trident]] underfunded, but highly ranked in the priority of rebuilding Lashkargah.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ministry of Defence|title=Gurkhas help Royal Engineers continue Babaji regeneration|url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/MilitaryOperations/GurkhasHelpRoyalEngineersContinueBabajiRegeneration.htm |date=6 July 2010|access-date=2010-09-03}}</ref>

A current project in the city, to aid regeneration is the "Lashkargah Bost Airport and Agriculture Center".  This project will consist of constructing a new agricultural center, an [[Industrial Park]] and will repair, upgrade and modernise [[Bost Airport]] through renovation projects.
