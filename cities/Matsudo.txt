==History==
{{unreferencedsect|date=November 2021}}
The area around Matsudo has been inhabited since prehistoric times, and archaeologists have found remains from the [[Jōmon period]], as well as [[kofun|burial tumuli]] from the [[Kofun period]]. During the [[Edo period]], the area was ''[[tenryō]]'' controlled directly by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], and contained a number of horse ranches providing [[war horse]]s for the Shōgun's armies. It also developed as a [[shukuba|post station]] on the [[Mito Kaidō]] connecting [[Edo]] with [[Mito, Ibaraki|Mito]], and supplied vegetables and the produce to [[Edo]] via its waterways. Matsudo Shrine has a close connection with [[Tokugawa Mitsukuni]] and the Matsudo Tojo was the residence of [[Tokugawa Akitake]], the last ''[[daimyō]]'' of [[Mito Domain]] after the [[Meiji restoration]].

Matsudo Town was created in [[Higashikatsushika District, Chiba|Higashikatsushika District]] Chiba Prefecture with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Matsudo attained city status on October 1, 1943.

On September 1, 1954, the neighboring town of Kashiwa merged with neighboring Kogane Town and Tsuchi and Tanaka villages to form the new city of {{nihongo|Tokatsu|東葛市|Tokatsu-shi}}. However, many politicians in Kogane Town were vehemently opposed to the merger, and forced its dissolution on October 15, 1954 with most of former Kogane Town merging with Matsudo instead. Beginning in the 1960s, the rapid economic growth in Japan (and the Tokyo area in particular) led to a construction boom in Matsudo and the development of the area as a major suburb of Tokyo. Matsudo is now the fourth-largest city in Chiba Prefecture and a major [[bedroom community]]  in the [[Greater Tokyo Area]].

==Government==
Matsudo has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 44 members. Matsudo contributes seven members to the Chiba Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between the [[Chiba 6th district]] and the [[Chiba 7th district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
{{unreferencedsect|date=November 2021}}
Matsudo is a regional commercial center and a [[bedroom community]] for nearby Chiba and Tokyo, with some 37% of the population commuting to Tokyo. Although located in Chiba Prefecture, the city has relatively poor transportation connections to Chiba City. The city has a mixed industrial base. The small electric motor manufacturer, [[Mabuchi Motor]] is headquartered in Matsudo.

==Education==
===Universities===
* [[Chiba University]], Matsudo Campus
* [[Nihon University]], Matsudo Dental Campus
* [[Ryutsu Keizai University]], Matsudo Campus
* [[Seitoku University]]
* [[Seitoku University Junior College]]

===Primary and secondary education===
Matsudo has 45 public elementary schools and 20 public junior high schools operated by the city government,, and eight public high schools operated by the Chiba Prefectural Board of Education.
