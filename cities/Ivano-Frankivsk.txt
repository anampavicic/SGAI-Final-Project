Built in the mid-17th century as a fortress of the Polish [[Potocki family]], Stanisławów was annexed to the [[Habsburg monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] during the [[First Partition of Poland]] in 1772, after which it became the property of the State within the [[Austrian Empire]]. The fortress was slowly transformed into one of the most prominent cities at the foothills of the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. After [[World War I]], for several months, it served as a temporary capital of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]]. Following the [[Peace of Riga]] in 1921, Stanisławów became part of the [[Second Polish Republic]]. After the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] at the onset of [[World War II]], the city was [[Soviet annexation of the western Ukrainian territories|annexed]] by the Soviet Union, only to be occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] two years later. With the liberation of Soviet Ukraine in 1944 and the [[Polish population transfers (1944–1946)|shifting of borders]], the city remained part of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] and was renamed in 1962 after [[Ivan Franko]]. With the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the city become part of newly-independent Ukraine.

Ivano-Frankivsk is one of the principal cities of the [[Carpathian Euroregion]]. There are elements of various cultures intertwined in the city's architecture, including the Polish [[Ratusha (Ivano-Frankivsk)|city hall]], the Austro-Hungarian city's business centre, the Soviet [[Panelák|prefabricated apartment blocks]] at the city's [[rural–urban fringe]], and others.

The town of Stanisławów was founded as a fortress in order to protect the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] from [[List of Mongol and Tatar attacks in Europe|Tatar invasions]] and to defend the multi-ethnic population of the region in case of armed conflicts such as the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] of 1648. The fort was originally built next to [[Zabolotiv]] village (known since 1435),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.castles.com.ua/stanislawow.html |script-title=uk:Замки і храми України |publisher=Castles.com |language=uk}}</ref> and Knyahynyn (1449).<ref name="nazarpanchyshyn.wordpress.com" /> The village of Zabolotiv and the land around it were purchased by [[Andrzej Potocki]] from another [[Szlachta|Polish nobleman]], Rzeczkowski. Stanisławów was issued by Potocki and his declaration establishing the city with [[Magdeburg rights]] on 7 May 1662; but the city and its rights, however, were not recognized by the Polish Crown until 14 August 1663, when [[John II Casimir Vasa|John Casimir]] had finally approved it. By 1672, the fortress had been rebuilt from wood to stone, brick, and mortar. Also a new large fortified Potocki palace was erected in the place of an older wood structure. Today this building serves as the [[military hospital]]. In the same year Jews were granted the right to become permanent residents, who could work, conduct commerce and travel in and out of the city as they pleased.<ref>[http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/pinkas_poland/pol2_00360.html Jewish Genealogy] – The Jewish Settlement from its Inception until 1772.</ref>

Originally the city was divided into two districts: [[Tysmenytsia]] and Halych. Sometime in 1817–1819 the neighbouring village of Zabolottya, that had a special status, was incorporated into the city as a new district, while Tysmenytsia district was divided into Tysmenytsia and Lysets districts. Each district had its main street corresponded with its name: Halych Street (Halych district), Tysmenytsia Street which today is [[Independence Street (Ivano-Frankivsk)|Independence Street]] (Tysmenytsia district), Zabolotiv Street – Mykhailo [[Hrushevsky Street (Ivano-Frankivsk)|Hrushevsky Street]] and Street of Vasylyanok (Zabolottya district), and Lysets Street – Hetman Mazepa Street (Lysets district). Later the city was split into six small districts: midtown where the rich [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] population and [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]s lived, pidzamche (subcastle), and four suburbs – Zabolotiv, Tysmenytsia, Halych and Lysets where the [[Plebs|plebeian]]s lived.<ref name="brief">{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.history.iv-fr.net/article.php?id=941 Brief History of Ivano-Frankivsk] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728040654/http://www.history.iv-fr.net/article.php?id=941 |date=2011-07-28 }}</ref>

[[Romanian occupation of Pokuttya|It was occupied]] by the [[Romania]]n army for the summer months from 25 May to 21 August 1919. During the [[Polish–Soviet War]] in 1920, the [[Red Army]] took over the city for a brief period. After the Soviet retreat, Ukrainian troops loyal to [[Symon Petliura|Symon Petlura]] occupied the city for a few days. At this period of history the city was in complete disorder.<ref>[http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/pinkas_poland/pol2_00364.html#part3 Jewish Genealogy] – Between the Two World Wars</ref> It then became part of Poland until the start of World War II.

In the 1939 [[invasion of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany|German]] and [[Red Army|Soviet forces]], the territory was captured by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] in September 1939 and annexed to the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]]. Between September 1939 and June 1941, the Soviet regime ordered thousands of inhabitants of the city to leave their houses and move to [[Siberia]], where most of them perished. Numerous people were taken out of the city prison and simply shot outside of the city when Soviet forces were leaving it in 1941. Ivano-Frankivsk was occupied by German forces from 2 July 1941 to 27 July 1944. There were more than 40,000 Jews in Stanisławów when it was occupied by the Nazis on 26 July 1941. The [[Stanisławów Ghetto]] was formed. During the occupation (1941–44), more than 600 educated Poles and most of the city's Jewish population were murdered.<ref name="yadvashem">[http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%202292.pdf yadvashem.org]</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Carmi |first1=Krystyna |title=The strange ways of providence in my life |date=2015 |publisher=CreateSpace |location=North Charleston, SC, USA |isbn=978-1507811467 |page=105}}</ref>

In early 1944, the city became part of the Soviet Union and was again renamed ''Stanislav''. The Soviets forced most of the Polish population to leave the city, where most of them settled in the [[Recovered Territories]]. In 1962, the city was renamed ''Ivano-Frankivsk'' after the Ukrainian writer [[Ivan Franko]].<ref name="britannica"/>

During the post-war period, the city was part of the [[Carpathian Military District]] housing the [[38th Army (Soviet Union)|38th Army]] (70th Motor Rifle Division) that participated in [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]].

Until 18 July 2020, Ivano-Frankivsk was incorporated as a [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]] and the center of [[Ivano-Frankivsk Municipality]]. The municipality was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast to six. The area of Ivano-Frankivsk Municipality was merged into the newly established Ivano-Frankivsk Raion.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Про утворення та ліквідацію районів.

== Geography ==
The city is situated in the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] region northeast of the mountain range, sitting approximately {{convert|120|m|ft}} [[above mean sea level]].<ref>{{cite web |title=UKRAINE : general data |url=http://www.populstat.info/Europe/ukraineg.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625153841/http://www.populstat.info/Europe/ukraineg.htm |archive-date=June 25, 2009 |access-date=May 5, 2009 |publisher=Populstat.info}}</ref> One of the several main geographical features is the Vovchynets Hill also known as the Vovchynets Mountains. The hill reaches 300-{{convert|350|m|ft}} above sea level and is part of the Pokuttya Highland ([[Highland (geography)|Upland]]). Around the hill [[Bystrytsia River]] branches into Bystrytsia of Nadvirna, Bystrytsia of Solotvyn, and Vorona. The last two rivers serve as a natural border between the ''Pokuttya Highland'' and ''Stanislav Basin''. The Vovchynets Hill is located just outside and northeast of Ivano-Frankivsk. Located southeast from the Stanislav Basin in the direction of the [[Prut]] Valley is the Khorosnen (Prut-Bystrytsia) Highland. The highest point of that highland is Mount Hostra, {{convert|425|m|ft}}.

The closest neighboring city is [[Tysmenytsia]], less than {{convert|10|km|mi}} to the east. Other cities that lie in the radius of {{convert|25|to|30|km|0|abbr=on}} are [[Tlumach]] (east), [[Nadvirna]] (south), [[Kalush, Ukraine|Kalush]] (west), and [[Halych]] (north). The city also administers five adjacent villages that surround it: Mykytyntsi, Krykhivtsi, Vovchynets, Uhornyky, and Khryplyn.

===Sports===
[[File:Frankiwsk Miczkiewicza 2 Sokil IMG 0033 26-101-0275.JPG|thumb|House of Sokol Sport Association, 1895]]
Ivano-Frankivsk is home to a number of sports teams. Most notably, it was home to the football club [[FC Spartak Ivano-Frankivsk]] (Prykarpattya) that participated on the national level since the 1950s. Since 2007, the club only fields its youth team Spartak-93 and competes in the Children-Youth Football League of Ukraine. The former president of Spartak Anatoliy Revutskiy reorganized the local university ([[Ivano-Frankivsk National Technical University of Oil and Gas|University of Oil and Gas]]) team in 2007 into the new "[[FSC Prykarpattya Ivano-Frankivsk|FSK Prykarpattia]]" with support of the city mayor Anushkevychus making it the main football club in the region and replacing Spartak. Previously during the interbellum period, the city was home to another football club based on the local Polish garrison and called [[Rewera Stanisławów]] (1908). That club competed at a regional level that had evolved at that period. With the start of [[World War II]], that club was disbanded. During the Soviet period among several others there was another club "Elektron" that successfully participated at a regional level around the 1970s.

The city also is the home to a [[futsal]] team, [[Urahan Ivano-Frankivsk|PFC Uragan Ivano-Frankivsk]], that competes in the [[Ukrainian Futsal Championship]]. They were the Ukrainian champions having won the 2010/11 season playoffs and therefore took part in the [[2011–12 UEFA Futsal Cup]] for the first time.

The city had an ice hockey team, [[Vatra Ivano-Frankivsk|HC Vatra Ivano-Frankivsk]], which previously played in the [[Ukrainian Hockey Championship]].

Ivano-Frankivsk is also the hometown of Ukrainian gymnasts; one of them is [[Dariya Zgoba]] who won gold on the uneven bars in the 2007 European Championships and became a finalist on the Beijing Olympics; the other one is [[Yana Demyanchuk]], who won gold on the [[balance beam]] at the 2009 European Championships.

* [[BC Hoverla|Hoverla Ivano-Frankivsk]] (basketball)
* [[Roland Ivano-Frankivsk]] (rugby)
