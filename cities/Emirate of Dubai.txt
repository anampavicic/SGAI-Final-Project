The '''Emirate of Dubai'''{{efn|{{langx|ar|إمارة دبيّ|translit=ʾImārat Dubayy}}}} is one of the seven [[emirates of the United Arab Emirates]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Seven Emirates of the UAE|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-7-emirates-of-the-uae.html|access-date=2021-08-31|website=WorldAtlas|date=November 5, 2018 |language=en-US|archive-date=September 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210920030200/https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-7-emirates-of-the-uae.html|url-status=live}}</ref> It is the most populous emirate of the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]]. The capital of the emirate is the eponymous city, [[Dubai]].

==Geography==
The city of Dubai is located on the coast of the Persian Gulf, while the Emirate stretches inland and is bordered to the south by the [[emirate of Abu Dhabi]], to the northeast by the [[emirate of Sharjah]], to the southeast by the country of [[Oman]], to the east by the [[emirate of Ajman]], and to the north by the [[emirate of Ras Al Khaimah]].

== Subdivisions ==
The emirate and the coterminous city is subdivided into nine numbered sectors.<ref>[https://www.dsc.gov.ae/Publication/Dubai_Population_07_english.pdf Dubai Population Bulletin 2007]</ref>

Dubai is divided into 9 sectors of which 1 to 6 are urban and 7 to 9 are rural. In numbers of 2007: 1.511.423 urban, 18.369 rural, 1.529.792 total. The sectors are subdivided into 224 [[List_of_communities_in_Dubai|communities]]. In other sources, the sectors and communities are called districts and subdistricts. The exclave of Hatta is a community in Sector 8.

==History==
[[File:Dubai by Copernicus Sentinel-2 in false-colour.jpg|thumb|Dubai by Copernicus [[Sentinel-2]] satellite in false-colour in 2024]]

In the early 19th century, the coastal township of Dubai was located within the territorial lands of the [[Bani Yas]] tribe, however Dubai was also on the borderlands near the control of the powerful [[Al Qasimi]] clan. This caused both groups to assert authority over the town.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Krane |first=Jim |url=http://archive.org/details/dubaistoryofworl0000kran |title=Dubai: The Story of the World's Fastest City |publisher=Atlantic |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-84887-009-3 |location=London, England |pages= |language=en}}</ref>{{Rp|page=13}}

In the 19th century, pearls were the main commodity of the region, with buyers from [[Mumbai]], commerce peaked in 1897.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=26}}

In 1901, [[Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum]] established Dubai as a free port with no taxation on imports or exports and also gave merchants parcels of land and guarantees of protection and tolerance. These policies saw a movement of merchants not only directly from [[Bandar Lengeh|Lingeh]],<ref name=":12">{{Cite book |last=Lorimer |first=John |title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf |publisher=British Government, Bombay |year=1915 |page=2236}}</ref> but also those who had settled in [[Ras Al Khaimah]] and [[Sharjah]] (which had historical links with Lingeh through the [[Al-Qasimi|Al Qawasim]] tribe) to Dubai. An indicator of the growing importance of Dubai can be gained from the movements of the steamer of the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company, which from 1899 to 1901 paid five visits annually to Dubai. In 1902, the company's vessels made 21 visits to Dubai and from 1904 on,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lorimer |first=John |title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf |publisher=British Government, Bombay |year=1915 |page=743}}</ref> the steamers called fortnightly – in 1906, trading 70,000 tonnes of cargo.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wilson |first=Graeme |title=Father of Dubai |publisher=Media Prima |year=1999 |page=34}}</ref> The frequency of these vessels helped to accelerate Dubai's role as an emerging port and trading hub of preference. British historian John Lorimer noted the transfer of merchants from Lingeh "bids fair to become complete and permanent",<ref name=":12" /> and also that the town had by 1906 supplanted Lingeh as the chief entrepôt of the Trucial States. By 1908, Dubai was home to a population of some 10,000 people.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=|pages=21-23}}

By the 1930s and 1940s, the pearl business crashed due to [[Cultured pearl|cultured pearls]] from Japan. The economy crashed which triggered a famine.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=28}} Hopes were reignited when in 1937 an oil exploration contract was signed which guaranteed [[Royalty payment|royalty]] rights for Dubai and concessionary payments to Sheikh [[Saeed bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum|Saeed bin Maktoum]]. However, due to [[World War II]], oil would not be struck until 1966 at the [[Fateh Oil Field|Fateh oil field]].<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=|pages=36-37}}

In December 1971, the emirates united to form the [[United Arab Emirates]], thus ending their status as British Protectorates.<ref>{{Cite web|title="History of the UAE - UAE Government Website"|url=https://u.ae/en/more/history-of-the-uae|access-date=2022-05-27|work=Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority - Government of the UAE|archive-date=July 3, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220703105750/https://u.ae/en/more/history-of-the-uae|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title="A Guide to the United States' History of Recognition, Diplomatic, and Consular Relations, by Country, since 1776: The United Arab Emirates"|url=https://history.state.gov/countries/united-arab-emirates|access-date=2022-05-27|work=Office of the Historian - Government of the United States|archive-date=February 21, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220221093615/https://history.state.gov/countries/united-arab-emirates|url-status=live}}</ref>

The ruler of the emirate is Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dubai Ruler - The GDMO - Dubai Government Media Office|url=https://mediaoffice.ae/general-information/dubai-ruler#:~:text=Vice%20President%20and%20Prime%20Minister,Sheikh%20Hamdan%20and%20Sheikh%20Ahmed.|access-date=2021-04-29|website=mediaoffice.ae|archive-date=April 29, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210429061125/https://mediaoffice.ae/general-information/dubai-ruler#:~:text=Vice%20President%20and%20Prime%20Minister,Sheikh%20Hamdan%20and%20Sheikh%20Ahmed.|url-status=live}}</ref> The emirate is made up of various other communities. The inland [[exclave]] of [[Hatta, United Arab Emirates|Hatta]] is located about 134 km east of the city of Dubai. The exclave is bordered by [[Oman]] to the east and south, the villages of [[Sayh Mudayrah]] and [[Masfout]] in [[Ajman]] to the west, and [[Ras Al Khaimah]] to the north.
