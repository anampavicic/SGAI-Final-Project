An ancient city with a long history, Cagliari has seen the rule of several civilisations. Under the buildings of the modern city there is a continuous stratification attesting to human settlement over the course of some five thousand years, from the [[Neolithic]] to today. Historical sites include the prehistoric [[Domus de Janas]], very damaged by cave activity, a large [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian era]] [[necropolis]], a Roman era [[amphitheatre]], a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[basilica]], three Pisan-era towers and a strong system of fortification that made the town the core of [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Habsburg]] imperial power in the western [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Its natural resources have always been its sheltered harbour, the often powerfully fortified hill of ''Castel di Castro'', the modern ''Casteddu'', the [[salt]] from its lagoons, and, from the [[hinterland]], wheat from the [[Campidano]] plain and silver and other ores from the [[Iglesiente]] mines.

Cagliari was the capital of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] from 1324 to 1848, when [[Turin]] became the formal capital of the kingdom (which in 1861 became the [[Kingdom of Italy]]). Today the city is a regional cultural, educational, political and artistic centre, known for its diverse [[Art Nouveau]] architecture and several monuments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.it-schools.com/sections/travel-and-culture-in-italy/sardiniat/cagliari-art.shtml |title=Cagliari art (Italian Language Schools and Courses to Learn Italian in Italy.) |publisher=It-schools.com |access-date=20 April 2010 |archive-date=27 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727061458/http://www.it-schools.com/sections/travel-and-culture-in-italy/sardiniat/cagliari-art.shtml |url-status=dead }}</ref> It is also Sardinia's economic and industrial hub, having one of the [[Port of Cagliari|biggest ports in the Mediterranean Sea]], an [[Cagliari-Elmas Airport|international airport]], and the 106th highest income level in Italy (among 8,092 [[comuni]]), comparable to that of several northern Italian cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2011-03-26/milano-stacca-tutti-classifica-132221.shtml?uuid=AauRDnJD|title=Nell'Italia delle tasse Milano stacca tutti - Guarda il reddito del tuo Comune |publisher=Il Sole 24 ORE |access-date=15 October 2013}}</ref>

===Early history===
[[File:Mosaico Karalitani Ostia.jpg|thumb|180px|Karalitan ship owners and traders, mosaic in [[Ostia Antica]]]]

The Cagliari area has been inhabited since the [[Neolithic]]. It occupies a favourable position between the sea and a fertile plain and is surrounded by two [[marsh]]es (which provides defence against attacks from the inland). There are high mountains nearby, to which people could evacuate if the settlement had to be given up. Relics of prehistoric inhabitants were found in the hill of Monte Claro ([[Monte Claro culture]]) and in [[Cape Sant'Elia]] (several [[domus de janas]]).

'''Karaly''' ({{langx|xpu|ê§äê§ìê§ã{{popdf}}ê§â}}, {{sc|krly}}){{sfnp|Mastino|2006}} was established around the 8th/7th century BC as one of a string of [[Phoenicia]]n colonies in Sardinia, including [[Tharros]].<ref>[[Claudian]], De Bello Gildonico, IV A.D.: city located in front of Libya (Africa), founded by the powerful [[Tyro]], Karalis extends in length, between the waves, with a small bumpy hill, disperses headwinds. It follows a port in the mid of the sea, and all strong winds are softened in the shelter of the pond. (521. Urbs Lybiam contra Tyrio fundata potenti 521. Tenditur in longum Caralis, tenuemque per undas 
522. Obvia dimittit fracturum flamina collem. 
523. Efficitur portus medium mare: tutaque ventis 
524. Omnibus, ingenti mansuescunt stagna recessu)</ref> The etymology of the toponym is unknown. It almost certainly does not come from the Phoenician language, but it has some similarities with other Sardinian or Asia Minor toponyms.<ref>M.L.Wagner,La lingua sarda, storia spirito e forma</ref> Its founding is linked to its position along communication routes with Africa as well as to its excellent port. The Phoenician settlement was located in the [[Stagno di Cagliari|Stagno di Santa Gilla]], west of the present centre of Cagliari. This was also the site of the Roman ''Portus Scipio'', and when Arab pirates raided the area in the 8th century it became the refuge for people fleeing from the city. Other Phoenician settlements have been found at Cape Sant'Elia.

In the late 6th century BC [[Carthage]] took control of part of Sardinia, and Cagliari grew substantially under its domination, as testified by the large [[Tuvixeddu necropolis]] and other remains. Cagliari was a fortified settlement in what is now the modern Marina quarter, with an annexed holy area in the modern Stampace.

Sardinia and Cagliari came under [[Roman Republic|Roman rule]] in 238 BC, shortly after the [[First Punic War]], when the Romans defeated the Carthaginians. No mention of it is found on the occasion of the Roman conquest of the island but, during the [[Second Punic War]], '''Caralis''' was the headquarters of the praetor, [[Titus Manlius Torquatus (dictator)|Titus Manlius Torquatus]], whence he conducted his operations against [[Hampsicora]] and the Carthaginians.<ref>[[Livy]] xxiii. 40, 41.</ref> At other times it was also the Romans' chief naval station on the island and the residence of its praetor.<ref>''Id.'' xxx. 39.</ref>

The Romans built a new settlement east of the old Punic city, the ''vicus munitus Caralis'' (i.e. the fortified [[Vicus (Rome)|community]] of Caralis) mentioned by [[Varro Atacinus]]. The two urban agglomerations merged gradually during the second century BC; to this process is perhaps attributable the plural name '''Carales'''.<ref>Attilio Mastino (a cura di), Storia della Sardegna antica, Il Maestrale, Nuoro,2005</ref>

[[Florus]] calls it the ''urbs urbium'' or capital of Sardinia. He represents it as taken and severely punished by [[Gracchus]],<ref>ii. 6. ¬ß 35.</ref> but this statement is wholly at variance with Livy's account of the wars of Gracchus, in Sardinia, according to which the cities were faithful to Rome, and the revolt was confined to the mountain tribes.<ref>xli. 6, 12, 17.</ref> In the [[Caesar's civil war|Civil War]] between [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] and [[Pompey]], the citizens of Caralis were the first to declare in favor of the former, an example soon followed by the other cities of Sardinia;<ref>[[Julius Caesar]] ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili]]'' i. 30.</ref> and Caesar himself touched there with his fleet on his return from Africa.<ref>Hirt. ''B. Afr.'' 98.</ref> A few years later, when Sardinia fell into the hands of [[Menas (freedman)|Menas]], the lieutenant of [[Sextus Pompeius]], Caralis was the only city which offered any resistance, but was taken after a short siege.<ref>[[Cassius Dio]] xlviii. 30.</ref>

Cagliari continued to be regarded as the capital of the island under the [[Roman Empire]], and though it did not become a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]], obtained the status of ''[[municipium]]''.<ref>[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] iii. 7. s. 13; [[Strabo]] v. p. 224; [[Pomponius Mela]], ii. 7; ''[[Antonine Itinerary]]'' pp. 80, 81, 82, ''etc.''</ref>

Remains of Roman public buildings were found to the west of Marina in Piazza del Carmine. There was an area of ordinary housing near the modern Via Roma, and richer houses on the slopes of the Marina distinct. The amphitheatre is located to the west of the Castello.

A [[Christians|Christian]] community is attested in Cagliari at least as early as the 3rd century, and by the end of that century the city had a Christian bishop. In the middle decades of the 4th century bishop [[Lucifer of Cagliari]] was exiled because of his opposition to the sentence against [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] at the [[Synod of Milan]]. He was banished to the desert of [[Thebais]] by the emperor [[Constantius II]].<ref>Sozomen, ''Ecclesiastical History'', 3.15 and 5.12</ref>

[[Claudian]] describes the ancient city of Karalis as extending to a considerable length towards the promontory or headland, the projection of which sheltered its port. The port affords good anchorage for large vessels, but besides this, which is only a well-sheltered standby, there is a large salt-water lake or lagoon, called the [[Stagno di Cagliari]], adjoining the city and communicating by a narrow channel with the bay, which appears from Claudian to have been used in ancient times as an inner harbor or basin.<ref>Claud. ''B. Gild.'' 520-24.</ref> The promontory adjoining the city is evidently that noticed by Ptolemy ({{lang|grc|ŒöŒ¨œÅŒ±ŒªŒπœÇ œÄœåŒªŒπœÇ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºÑŒ∫œÅŒ±}}), but the Caralitanum Promontorium of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] can be no other than the headland, now called [[Capo Carbonara]], which forms the eastern boundary of the [[Gulf of Cagliari]] and the southeast point of the whole island. Immediately off it lay the little island of Ficaria,<ref>Pliny ''l. c.''; Ptolemy iii. 3. ¬ß 8.</ref> now called the ''Isola dei Cavoli'' ("Cabbage Island" in Italian, ''Isula de is C√†vurus'' "Crab Island" in Sardinian).

After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] Cagliari fell, together with the rest of Sardinia, into the hands of the [[Vandals]], but appears to have retained its importance throughout the Middle Ages.

===Judicate of Cagliari===
{{Main|Judicate of Cagliari}}
[[File:Et√† bizantina, botteghe alto-giudicali sarde, plutei di san macario, da sant'efisio di nora, 950 dc ca. 01 grifo e pegaso tra albero della vita.jpg|thumb|left|Griffin and Pegasus pluteo, Byzantine Middle Ages. National Archaeological Museum of Cagliari.]]
Subsequently, ruled by the Vandals, [[Ostrogoths]], and then part of the [[Byzantine Empire]], Cagliari became the capital of a gradually independent [[Sardinian medieval kingdoms|Judicate]], (from Latin Iudex, Governor and Supreme Magistrate, used in late Roman and Byzantine period, along with the medieval Greek ·ºÑœÅœáœâŒΩ). This state was born around 1020 and was overthrown by the [[Republic of Pisa]] in 1258. Due to the overlap of buildings since the year 800 B.C., and the scarcity of archeological and historical informations, it was believed that the population was moved to more inland areas of the territory, along the lagoon, in a city called Santa Ilia or [[Santa Igia]] (modern San Gilla) and it was believed that the ancient Roman and Byzantine city had been abandoned because it was too exposed to attacks by [[Moors|Moorish]] pirates coming from north Africa and Spain. Recent studies have instead hypothesized that the capital of the Giudicato was located around the road that it directed towards [[Sassari]], today called Corso Vittorio Emanuele II (in Sardinian language: Su Brugu, the borough), although there are not yet archeological confirmations, particularly of the Cathedral and the Judex Palace, destroyed after the Pisan conquest.<ref>Corrado Zedda, 2017, Il Giudicato di Cagliari: storia, societ√†, evoluzione e crisi di un regno sardo</ref><ref>Raimondo Pinna, 2010, Santa Igia. La Citt√† del Giudice Guglielmo, edizioni Condaghes</ref> The Judicate of Cagliari comprised a large area of the Campidano plain, the [[Sulcis]]-[[Iglesiente]] and the mountain region of [[Ogliastra]].

===11th to 13th century===
[[File:TorreElefanteCagliari-pjt2.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Torre dell'Elefante]] (1307)]]
During the 11th century, the [[Republic of Pisa]] began to extend its political influence over the Judgedom of Cagliari. Pisa and the maritime [[republic of Genoa]] had a keen interest in Sardinia because it was a perfect strategic base for controlling the commercial routes between Italy and North Africa.

In 1215 the Pisan [[Lamberto Visconti]], husband of [[Elena of Gallura]], forced the judikessa [[Benedetta of Cagliari]] to give him the mount located east of [[Santa Igia]].{{sfn|Casula|1994|p=209-210}} Soon (1216‚Äì17) Pisan merchants established there a new fortified city, known as ''Castel di Castro'', which can be considered the ancestor of the modern city of Cagliari.{{sfn|Casula|1994|p=209-210}}

In 1258, after the defeat of [[William III of Cagliari|William III]], the last king of Cagliari, the Pisans and their Sardinian allies ([[Giudicato of Arborea|Arborea]], [[Giudicato of Gallura|Gallura]] and [[Giudicato of Logudoro|Logudoro]]) destroyed the old capital of Santa Igia.{{sfn|Casula|1994|p=209-210}} The Judgedom of Cagliari was then divided into three parts: the northeast third went to Gallura; the central portion was incorporated into Arborea; [[Sulcis]] and [[Iglesiente]], on the southwest, were given to the Pisan [[della Gherardesca]] family, while the Republic of Pisa maintained control over its colony of Castel di Castro.{{sfn|Casula|1994|p=210-212}}

Some of the fortifications that still surround the current district of Castello were built by the Pisans, including the two remaining white limestone towers (early 14th century) designed by the architect [[Giovanni Capula]]. Together with the district of Castello, Castel di Castro comprised the districts of [[Marina]] (which included the port), and later {{Interlanguage link|Stampace|it}} and Villanova. Marina and Stampace were guarded by walls, in contrast to Villanova, which was mostly home to peasants.

===14th to 17th centuries===
{{Main|Kingdom of Sardinia}}
In the second decade of the 14th century the [[Crown of Aragon]] [[Aragonese conquest of Sardinia|conquered Sardinia]] after a series of battles against the [[Pisa]]ns. During the siege of Castel di Castro (1324-1326), the Aragonese, led by [[Alfonso IV of Aragon]], built a stronghold on a more southern hill, that of Bonaria.
[[File:Braun_hogenberg_Cagliari_1572.jpg|thumb|View of Cagliari from ''Civitates orbis terrarium'' (1572) by [[Georg Braun]]]]
When the fortified city was finally conquered by the Aragonese army, Castel di Castro (''Castel de C√†ller'' or simply C√†ller in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) became the administrative capital of the newborn [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], one of the many kingdoms forming the Crown of Aragon, which later came under the rule of the [[Spanish Empire]]. After the expulsion of the Tuscans,{{sfn|Casula|1994|p=304}} the Castello district was repopulated by the Aragonese settlers of Bonaria while the indigenous population was, as in the past, concentrated in Stampace and Villanova.

The [[kings of Sardinia]], also [[kings of Aragon]] and later [[kings of Spain]], were represented in Cagliari by a [[List of viceroys of Sardinia|viceroy]], who resided in the [[Palazzo Regio]].
[[File:PalazzoRegio3.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Interior view of the [[Palazzo Regio|Royal Palace of Cagliari]]]]

In the 16th century the fortifications of the city were strengthened with the construction of the [[bastion]]s and the rights and benefits of the Aragonese were extended to all citizens. The intellectual life was relatively lively and in the early years of the 17th century the university was founded.

===18th century===
In 1718,<ref name="Guide to Cagliari">{{cite web|url=http://www.charmingsardinia.com/booksardegna/SARDINIA-Cagliari-Villasimius-Costa%20Rei-Oristano-2009.pdf |title=Guide to Cagliari, Villasimius, Costa Rei |work=CharmingSardinia |date=February 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711085802/http://www.charmingsardinia.com/booksardegna/SARDINIA-Cagliari-Villasimius-Costa%20Rei-Oristano-2009.pdf |archive-date=11 July 2009 }}</ref> after a brief rule by the [[Habsburgs]], Cagliari and [[Sardinia]] came under the [[House of Savoy]]. As rulers of Sardinia, the Savoys took the title of kings of the Sardinian kingdom. During the Savoyard Era, until 1848, the institutions of the Sardinian kingdom remained unchanged, but with the "[[Perfect Fusion]]" in that year, all the possessions of the House of Savoy House, comprising [[Savoy]], [[Nice]] (now part of [[France]]), [[Piedmont]] and from 1815 [[Liguria]], were merged into a unitary state. Although Sardinian by name, the kingdom had its parliament in [[Turin]], where the Savoys resided, and its members were mainly aristocrats from [[Piedmont]] or the mainland.

In the late 18th century during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] France tried to conquer Cagliari because of its strategic role in the Mediterranean sea (''[[Exp√©dition de Sardaigne]]''). A French army landed on Poetto beach and advanced towards Cagliari, but the French were defeated by Sardinians who had decided to defend themselves against the revolutionary army. The people of Cagliari hoped to receive some concession from the Savoys in return for their defence of the town. For example, aristocrats from Cagliari asked for a Sardinian representative in the [[parliament]] of the kingdom. When the Savoyards refused any concession to the Sardinians, the inhabitants of Cagliari rose up against them and expelled all the representatives of the kingdom along with the Piedmontese rulers.{{sfn|Casula|1994|p=468}} This insurgence is celebrated in Cagliari during ''[[Sa die de sa Sardigna]]'' ("The day of Sardinia") on the last weekend of April. However, the Savoys regained control of the town after a brief period of [[autonomous entity|autonomous]] rule.

===Modern age===
[[File:CagliariBastioneRemy.jpg|thumb|Triumphal arch ''King Umberto I'', better known as ''Bastione Saint Remy'']]

The population by the 1840s had reached 29,000.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol.IV'', (1848), London, Charles Knight, p.12</ref> Starting in the 1870s, in the wake of the [[unification of Italy]], the city experienced a century of rapid growth. Numerous buildings combined influences from [[Art Nouveau]] together with the traditional Sardinian taste for floral decoration; an example is the [[white marble]] [[City Hall]] near the port. Many buildings were erected by the end of the 19th century during the term of office of mayor [[Ottone Bacaredda]].  In 1905 he had to face up to the a violent, bloody revolt against the exorbitant cost of living, stoked by his political opponents and which caused a number of victims and extensive material damage. After various other ups and downs, and following another resignation, he was returned to office between 1911 and 1917. Ottone Bacaredda died in his modest house in Via San Giovanni, on 26 December 1921,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2017 |title=Bacaredda Ottone - Cimitero Monumentale di Bonaria - Cagliari |trans-title=Bacaredda Ottone - Monumental Cemetery of Bonaria - Cagliari |url=https://cimiterobonaria.it/scheda/b00002/ |access-date=2024-02-13 |website=Cimitero Monumentale Bonaria |language=en}}</ref>

During the [[Second World War]] Cagliari was heavily bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in February 1943. In order to escape from the danger of [[bombardment]]s and difficult living conditions, many people were evacuated from the city into the countryside. In total the victims of the bombings were more than 2000<ref name="Bomb">{{cite web| url = http://www.comunecagliarinews.it/reportage.php?pagina=43| title = Comune Cagliari News, ''Bombe su Cagliari: cronologia di una strage''}}</ref> and about 80% of the buildings were damaged. The city received the [[Gold Medal of Military Valour]].<ref name="Bomb"/>

After the [[Armistice with Italy|Italian armistice]] with the Allies in September 1943, the [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] took control of Cagliari and the island, but soon retreated peacefully in order to reinforce their positions in mainland Italy. The [[United States Army|American Army]] then took control of Cagliari. Airports near the city ([[Elmas]], [[Monserrato]], [[Decimomannu]], currently a [[NATO]] airbase) were used by Allied aircraft to fly to North Africa or mainland Italy and [[Sicily]].

After the war, the population of Cagliari grew again and many apartment blocks and recreational areas were erected in new residential districts.

[[File:Cagliari11.jpg|thumb|The so-called Sella del Diavolo]]
{{blockquote|And suddenly there is Cagliari: a naked town rising steep, steep, golden-looking, piled naked to the sky from the plain at the head of the formless hollow bay. It is strange and rather wonderful, not a bit like Italy. The city piles up lofty and almost miniature, and makes me think of Jerusalem: without trees, without cover, rising rather bare and proud, remote as if back in history, like a town in a monkish, illuminated missal. One wonders how it ever got there. And it seems like Spain‚Äîor Malta: not Italy. It is a steep and lonely city, treeless, as in some old illumination. Yet withal rather jewel-like: like a sudden rose-cut amber jewel naked at the depth of the vast indenture. The air is cold, blowing bleak and bitter, the sky is all curd. And that is Cagliari. It has that curious look, as if it could be seen, but not entered. It is like some vision, some memory, something that has passed away. Impossible that one can actually walk in that city: set foot there and eat and laugh there. Ah, no! Yet the ship drifts nearer, nearer, and we are looking for the actual harbour.|[[D. H.

The city of Cagliari is situated in the south of Sardinia, overlooking the centre of the eponymous gulf, also called [[Golfo degli Angeli]] ("Bay of Angels") after an ancient legend. The city is spread over and around the hill of the historic district of Castello and nine other limestone hills of the middle-to-late Miocene, unique heights of a little more than {{convert|100|m|ft}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] on the long plains of Campidano. The plain is actually a [[Graben]] formed during the [[Alpine orogeny]] of the [[Cenozoic]], which separated Sardinia from the European continent, roughly where the [[Gulf of Lion]] is now. The Graben filled in the course of [[Tectonics|tectonic]] movements associated with the breakup of the ancient island [[Paleozoic]] skeleton.<ref>{{cite book|title=Atlante della Sardegna|editor1=R.

[[File:Cagliari panorama.jpg|thumb|View over the historical district of Villanova]]
The repeated intrusion of the sea left calcareous sediments that formed a series of hills that mark the territory of Cagliari. Castello is where the fortified town arose in the [[Middle Age]] near the harbour of the port, other hills are those of Mount Urpinu, the St. Elias hill, also known as the ''Sella del Diavolo'' ("Saddle of the Devil") for its shape, Tuvumannu and Tuvixeddu, the site of the ancient Punic and Roman necropolis, the small Bonaria hill, where the basilica stands, and the San Michele hill, with the eponymous castle on top. The modern city occupies the flat spaces between the hills and the sea to the south and southeast, along the Poetto beach, the lagoons and ponds of Santa Gilla and Molentargius, and the remains of more recent marine intrusions, in an articulate landscape with many landmarks and panoramas of the bay, the plain, and the mountains that surround it on the east (The Seven Brothers and Serpedd√¨) and west (the mountains of [[Capoterra]]). On the cold, clear days of winter, the snowy peaks of [[Gennargentu]] can be seen from the highest points of the city.

[[File:Cagliari.jpg|thumb|Fonsarda]]
The city has four historic neighbourhoods: Castello, Marina, Stampace and Villanova and several modern districts (such as San Benedetto, Monte Urpinu and Genneruxi at the east, Sant'Avendrace at the west, Is Mirrionis/San Michele at north and Bonaria, La Palma and Poetto at the south), grown when part of the ancient walls had been demolished in the middle of the 19th century.

=== Pirri ===
[[File:PirriSanMichele.png|thumb|left|Pirri]]
The comune of Cagliari has one [[circoscrizione]], the town of [[Pirri, Sardinia|Pirri]] (about 30.000 inhabitants), former village of the Campidano absorbed in the fast growth after the [[Second World War]].

===Parks and recreation===
[[File:Cagliari Giardini pubblici.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Roman statue]] in the old public gardens]]

Cagliari is one of the "greenest" Italian cities. Every inhabitant of Cagliari has access to {{convert|87.5|m2|ft2}} of public gardens and parks.<ref>{{cite web |title=Urbes |url=http://www.istat.it/it/files/2013/06/Urbes_2013.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204010425/http://www.istat.it/it/files/2013/06/Urbes_2013.pdf |archive-date=4 February 2015 |website=www.istat.it}}</ref>

Its mild climate allows the growth of numerous subtropical plants, such as ''[[Jacaranda mimosifolia]]'', ''[[Ficus macrophylla]]'', with some huge specimens in Via Roma and in the [[Orto Botanico dell'Universit√† di Cagliari|University Botanic Gardens]], ''[[Erythrina afra]]'' with its stunning red flowers, ''[[Ficus retusa]]'', which provides shade for several of the city's streets, ''[[Araucaria heterophylla]]'', the date palm (''[[Phoenix dactylifera]]''), the Canary Islands palm (''[[Phoenix canariensis]]'') and the Mexican Fan Palm (''[[Washingtonia robusta]]'').

Major city parks include:
[[File:Monte_Urpinu_Cagliari.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Cagliari, panorama from Monti Urpinu Park]]
[[File:Parco di Monte Claro (CA).jpg|thumb|Park of Monte Claro]]

* Monte Urpinu Park, the most wooded, is a low hill covered by a pine (''[[Pinus halepensis|Pinus halepensis Mill.]]'') and evergreen oak (''[[Quercus ilex|Quercus ilex L.]]'') forest with a dense Mediterranean maquis of mastic (''[[Pistacia lentiscus|Pistacia lentiscus L.]]''), juniper (''[[Juniperus phoenicea|Juniperus phoenicea L.]]''), Kermes oak (''[[Quercus coccifera|Quercus coccifera L.]]''), wild olive (''[[Olea europaea|Olea europaea L. ssp. europaea, var. sylvestris]]'') and tree spurge (''[[Euphorbia dendroides|Euphorbia dendroides L.]]''). It extends for about {{convert|25|ha|acre}}.
* Park of San Michele hill (about 25 hectares), with its medieval castle on the top;
* Terramaini Park, about {{convert|13|ha|acre}}, with a little pond which is home to flamingos and other wading birds;
* Monte Claro Provincial Park, about {{convert|22|ha|acre}}, which hosts the provincial library in an old mansion on the top of the hill;
* Ex-vetreria Pirri Park, about {{convert|2.5|ha|acre}};
* Public gardens, the oldest public esplanade of the city, planted in the 19th century, with a wonderful promenade of ''[[Jacaranda mimosifolia|Jacaranda mimosifolia D.Don]]''.

The [[Molentargius - Saline Regional Park]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parcomolentargius.it/ |title=Parco Molentargius - Saline |publisher=Parcomolentargius.it |access-date=3 May 2015}}</ref> is located near the city. Some mountain parks, such as Monte Arcosu or Maidopis, with large forests and wildlife (Sardinian deer, wild boars, etc.) are also nearby.

The city is the starting and ending point of the [[Path of 100 Towers (Sardinia)|Path of 100 Towers]], which consist of a trekking route named after the 105 towers located along the whole Sardinian coast.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Carrizzo |first=Rosanna |date=2017-10-16 |title=The 100 towers way, the path to fall in love with Sardinia |url=https://travel.thewom.it/italia/sardegna/cammino-100-torri.html |access-date=2022-12-04 |website=The Wom Travel |language=it}}</ref>

[[File:Poetto spiaggia.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Aerial view of Poetto Beach]]

====Beaches====
{{Main|Poetto}}
The main beach of Cagliari is the Poetto. It stretches for about {{convert|8|km|mi|0}}, from Sella del Diavolo ("Devil's Saddle") up to the coastline of Quartu Sant'Elena. Poetto is also the name of the district located on the western stretch of the strip between the beach and Saline di Molentargius ("Molentargius's Salt Mine").

Another smaller beach is that of Calamosca near the Sant'Elia district. On the coast between Calamosca and Poetto beaches, among the cliffs of the Sella del Diavolo, lies Cala Fighera, a small bay.

Cagliari is close to other seaside locations such as Santa Margherita di Pula, [[Chia (Sardinia)|Chia]], Geremeas, [[Solanas]], [[Villasimius]] and [[Costa Rei]].

===Climate===
[[File:Unusual snowy Cagliari, 1910.jpg|thumb|220px|Snow in Cagliari, 1910]]
Cagliari has a [[Mediterranean climate|hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K√∂ppen climate classification|K√∂ppen]]: ''Csa''), with hot, dry summers and mild winters like other historical regions along the coast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=6561&cityname=Cagliari,+Sardinia,+Italy&units=|title=Cagliari, Italy K√∂ppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=28 May 2019|archive-date=27 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727083942/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=6561&cityname=Cagliari,+Sardinia,+Italy&units=|url-status=dead}}</ref> Its precipitation values also bring it closer to [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] conditions.<ref name="ServizioMeteorologico2" /><ref>{{Citation|last=Wickens|first=Gerald E.|chapter=Arid and Semi-arid Environments of the World|date=1998|pages=5‚Äì15|editor-last=Wickens|editor-first=Gerald E.|series=Adaptations of Desert Organisms|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-662-03700-3_2|isbn=9783662037003|title=Ecophysiology of Economic Plants in Arid and Semi-Arid Lands}}</ref> The summer extreme values can be slightly over {{convert|40|¬∞C|0|abbr=on}}, sometimes with very high humidity, while in winter, under special and rare conditions, the temperature drops slightly below zero.

The average temperature of the coldest month, January, is about {{convert|10|¬∞C|0|abbr=on}}, and of the warmest month, August, about {{convert|25|¬∞C|0|abbr=on}}. But heat waves can occur, due to African anticyclone, starting in June. From mid-June to mid-September, rain is a rare event, limited to brief afternoon storms. The rainy season starts in September, and the first cold days come in December.<ref name=":0" />

Winds are frequent, especially the [[mistral (wind)|mistral]] and [[sirocco]]; in summer a marine sirocco breeze (called ''s'imbattu'' in [[Sardinian language]]) lowers the temperature and brings some relief from the heat.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Furberg |first1=M. |last2=Steyn |first2=D.

Minors (children aged 18 and younger) totaled 12.92% of the population, compared to pensioners at 24.81%. The average age of Cagliari residents is 47.44. The ratio of the population over 65 years of age to that under the age of 18, is 53.39%. The elderly population, defined as being over 65 years of age, has increased by 21.95% over the last 10 years. The current birth rate in Cagliari is 6.29 births per 1,000 inhabitants. The average number of people of any age per household is 2.11 and the percentage of households composed of a single person is 42.53%. The population of Cagliari is structured like that of other first world countries, especially as to the prevalence of an elderly population. The trend of these rates in the Cagliari metropolitan area is proportionally reversed in the suburbs, where most younger families move.

{{As of|2020}}, 5.8% (8,796 people) of the population was foreign, of which the largest group were [[Filipinos]] (17.21%), followed by [[Ukrainians]] (10.38%), [[Romanians]] (8.42%), [[Senegalese]] (8.25%) and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] (7.94%).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tuttitalia.it/sardegna/89-cagliari/statistiche/cittadini-stranieri-2020/#:~:text=Gli%20stranieri%20residenti%20a%20Cagliari,Romania%20(8%2C4%25).|title=Cittadini stranieri Cagliari 2020|access-date=25 January 2023}}</ref>

In 1928, during the fascist regime, the neighbouring municipalities of [[Pirri, Sardinia|Pirri]], [[Monserrato]], [[Selargius]], [[Quartucciu]] and [[Elmas]], were merged with that of Cagliari. Mussolini's regime wanted to streamline the local administration by eliminating many small towns and at the same time show that Italy was a major power with many large cities. After the war these small municipalities gradually regained their autonomy, except for the former town of [[Pirri, Sardinia|Pirri]].

The first table shows the inhabitants of the town in its present borders, the second one the commune population including the merged municipalities.

===Metropolitan City===
{{Main|Metropolitan City of Cagliari}}
[[File:Map of comune of Cagliari (metropolitan city of Cagliari, region Sardinia, Italy) - 2016.svg|thumb|left|Map of the metropolitan city of Cagliari; the capital is indicated in red.]]
The Metropolitan City of Cagliari has been established in 2016 by a Sardinia Regional Law and totals about 420,000 inhabitants according to ISTAT. It is composed of 17 municipalities along the coast of the gulf and up to {{convert|20|km|mi}} of the inner Campidano plain.

It covers an area on the plain of Campidano between large basins (Santa Gilla lagoon and salt mills of about 30 km2 or 3200 acres), ponds ([[Molentargius]]), 16,22 km2 (40,10 acres) and the depopulated mountains up to {{convert|1100|m|ft}} above sea level. The mountains are largely covered by forests mostly managed by the Ente Foreste of the Autonomous Region of Sardinia. To the west these amount to {{convert|256|km2|mi2}} on the Capoterra and Pula mountains. Monte Arcosu WWF Natural Reserve has another {{convert|36|km2|mi2}}, and to the east on Mount Serpedd√¨ and Sette Fratelli there are a total of {{convert|132|km2|mi2}} of forest.

The Metropolitan City is defined by municipalities where the population increased between the last two censuses, in a region where the population is otherwise generally decreasing. These municipalities welcome immigrants to the urban area whose main nucleus, the city of Cagliari, has a high number of elderly people.

In the last century, the population of the municipalities of the metropolitan area increased by 354% and in the last 50 years by 158% (1911: 128,444; 1961: 288,683; 2011: 454,819). For the whole of Sardinia this increase was respectively 88% and 15% (1911: 868,181; 1961: 1,419,362; 2011: 1,639,362). The urbanisation towards the area of Cagliari was, in percentage terms, impressive, making the capital of the island a metropolis surrounded by rural areas increasingly depopulated. This urbanisation is also reflected in the concentration in Cagliari of most of the economic activities and wealth.

The metropolitan area benefited an average income of 19,185 euros, 103% of the national average. With the 26% of the island population the Cagliari Metropolitan City produces the 31% of its GDP.

As the capital city of the Autonomous Region of Sardinia, Cagliari is the administrative hub and headquarters of the region as well as of the provincial and regional offices of the Italian central administration. Cagliari is also the main trade and industrial centre of the island, with numerous commercial sites and factories within its metropolitan boundaries.

Cagliari is the fourth port of Italy for movement of goods in tons (35,922,468), and the 18th for passengers (705,715), of whom 394,697 cruise passengers (8th in Italy).<ref>{{Cite web |date=2008 |title=AUTORITA' DI SISTEMA PORTUALE - MOVIMENTI PORTUALI |url=https://www.assoporti.it/media/4305/adsp_movimenti_portuali_2018_agg_18aprile2019.pdf}}</ref>

The first department store, ([[La Rinascente]]) opened in 1931 in the centre of the city, and it is still open today. Nowadays there are many commercial centres in the metropolitan area (Le Vele, Santa Gilla, La Corte del Sole, Marconi) hosting many European chain stores such as [[Auchan]], [[Metro AG]], [[Lidl]], [[Media Markt|MediaWorld]], [[Euronics]], [[Jysk (store)|Jysk]], [[IKEA]],<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ikea.com/ms/it_IT/puop/cagliari/index.html | title=Punto IKEA ordina, arreda di Cagliari orari, aperture | access-date=3 July 2016 | archive-date=30 June 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630205848/http://www.ikea.com/ms/it_IT/puop/cagliari/index.html | url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Carrefour]] and [[Bata Shoes]].

Cagliari is the main operational headquarters of the [[Banco di Sardegna]], which belongs to the BPER Group and is listed on [[Borsa Italiana]], of the [[Banca di Cagliari]]. [[Banca di Credito Sardo]] was based in Cagliari until it was absorbed by the parent company [[Intesa Sanpaolo]].

The Macchiareddu-Grogastru area between Cagliari and Capoterra is one of the most important industrial areas of Sardinia, in conjunction with a large international container terminal port at Giorgino.<ref>http://www.cict.it {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801101258/http://www.cict.it/ |date=1 August 2015 }}</ref> Beside having one of the biggest container terminals on the Mediterranean Sea, Cagliari also has one of the largest fish markets in Italy offering for sale a vast array of fish to both the public and traders. The communications provider [[Tiscali]] also has its headquarters in Cagliari.

Multinational corporations like [[Coca-Cola]], [[Heineken]], [[Unilever]], [[Bridgestone]] and [[Eni|Eni Group]] have factories in town. One of the six oil refinery supersites in Europe, [[Saras S.p.A.|Saras]], is located within the metropolitan area at [[Sarroch]].
[[File:Lungomare Poetto - Cagliari.jpg|thumb|Poetto Beach]]
Tourism is one of the major industries of the city, although historical venues such as its monumental [[Middle Ages]] and [[Early modern period]] defence system, its Carthaginian, Roman and Byzantine ruins are less highlighted compared to the recreational beaches and coastline. Cruise ships touring the Mediterranean often stop for passengers at Cagliari, and the city is a traffic hub to the nearby beaches of [[Villasimius]], [[Chia (Sardinia)|Chia]], [[Pula, Sardinia|Pula]] and [[Costa Rei]], as well as to the urban beach of Poettu. Pula is home to the archaeological site of the Punic and Roman city of [[Nora, Italy|Nora]]. Especially in summer many clubs and pubs are goals for young locals and tourists. Pubs and night-clubs are concentrated in the Corso Vittorio Emanuele II, a narrow street in Stampace district, in the Marina district, near the port and in the Castello district, The clubs are mostly to be found on the Poetto Beach (in summer) or in Viale Marconi (in winter). In Cagliari there are 180 B&B and 22 hotels that totals 3,300 beds. There are many others hotels in seaside resort of his gulf.

==Main sights==
Considerable remains of the ancient city of Karalis are still visible, including those of the [[Tuvixeddu necropolis]] (the largest Punic necropolis still in existence), the [[Roman amphitheatre (Cagliari)|Roman amphitheatre]], traditionally called ''Is centu scalas'' ("One hundred steps"), and of an [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]] used to provide generally scarce water. Still visible are also some ancient cisterns of vast extent, the ruins of a small circular temple, and numerous sepulchres on a hill outside the modern town that appear to have formed the necropolis of the ancient city.<ref>Smyth's ''Sardinia'', pp.&nbsp;206, 215Valery, ''Voyage en Sardaigne'', c.&nbsp;57.</ref>

[[File:Basilica di S.Saturnino.jpg|thumb|220px|right|San Saturnino Basilica, 5th century]]

The Palaeo-Christian [[Basilica of San Saturnino]], dedicated to a martyr killed under [[Diocletian]]'s reign, [[Saturninus of Cagliari]], patron saint of the city, was built in the 5th century. Of the original building the dome and the central part remain, to which two arms (one with a nave and two aisles) were added later. A Palaeo-Christian crypt is also under the church of ''San Lucifero'' (1660), dedicated to [[Saint Lucifer]], a bishop of the city. The church has a Baroque fa√ßade with ancient columns and sculpted parts, some of which came from the nearby [[necropolis]].
[[File:Cagliari02.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Eastern walls of Castello]]
[[File:At Cagliari, Sardinia 2019 079.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Church of San Michele]]
The old medieval town (called ''Castello'' in Italian, ''Casteddu de susu'' in Sardinian, "the upper castle") lies on top of a hill with a view of the Gulf of Cagliari (also known as Angels' Gulf). Most of its city walls are intact and include two early 14th-century white limestone towers, the [[Torre di San Pancrazio]] and the [[Torre dell'Elefante]], typical examples of Pisan military architecture. The local white limestone was also used to build the walls of the city and many other buildings, besides the towers. The exact period of construction of a fortress on this hill is unknown at present, due to the superposition of layers of buildings along the history. Some scholars<ref>Ferrucio Barreca, La Sardegna fenicia e punica, Storia della Sardegna antica e moderna, edizioni Chiarella, 1984</ref> have suggested a first urbanization of the quarter in the Punic era on the basis of similarity of the planimetry with the contemporary Carthaginian fortress of [[Monte Sirai]]. Recently, archaeological excavations have identified Punic and Roman buildings under the ramparts of the fortress.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Cagliari - indagini archeologiche presso il bastione di Santa Caterina |url=https://www.fastionline.org/docs/FOLDER-it-2012-264.pdf |journal=Fasti Online |issn=1828-3179}}</ref> Already the Roman poet [[Varro]] called the city "Vicus munitus", a fortified city, and sixteenth-century authors describe a Roman acropolis perhaps still visible in their day.<ref>Juan Francisco Carmona, Hymno a C√†ller</ref><ref>Roderigo Hunno Baeza, Caralis panegyricus</ref>

[[D. H. Lawrence]], in his memoir of a voyage to Sardinia, ''[[Sea and Sardinia]]'', that he undertook in January 1921, described the effect of warm Mediterranean sunlight on the white limestone city and compared Cagliari to a "white Jerusalem".
[[File:Cattedrale_Cagliari.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The cathedral (left) and the old city hall (right)]]
The [[Cagliari Cathedral|cathedral]] was restored in the 1930s, returning the former [[Baroque]] fa√ßade into a [[Medieval Pisan]]-style fa√ßade more akin to the original appearance of the church in the 13th century. The bell tower is original. The interior has a nave and two aisles, with a pulpit (1159‚Äì1162) sculpted for the [[Cathedral of Pisa]] but later donated to Cagliari. The crypt houses the remains of martyrs found in the Basilica of San Saturno (see below). Near the cathedral is the palace of the provincial government. Before 1900 it was the island's governor's palace.
[[File:Basilica di Bonaria.JPG|thumb|[[The Basilica of Our Lady of Bonaria]]]]
[[File:Sant'Anna (Cagliari).jpg|thumb|left|180px|Collegiata di Sant'Anna]]
The [[Shrine of Our Lady of Bonaria|Sanctuary of Our Lady of Bonaria]] ([[Names of Buenos Aires|from which the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina, gets its name]]) was built by the Catalans in 1324‚Äì1329 when they were besieging the Pisans in Castello. It has a small [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] portal in the fa√ßade and the interior houses a wooden statue of the Madonna, which, after having been thrown off a Spanish ship, landed at the foot of Bonaria hill. Bonaria hill is also the location of the [[Monumental Cemetery of Bonaria]].

The ''Chiesa della Purissima'' is a [[Catalan Gothic]] church built in the 16th century in the Castello distinct.

The other early districts of the town (Marina, Stampace and Villanova) retain much of their original character. In Stampace the [[Torre dello Sperone]], another tower built by the Pisans in the late 13th century, is located, as well as two important monumental churches: the ''Collegiata di Sant'Anna'' and the ''Chiesa di San Michele'', both built in the 18th century in a baroque style. Many more churches, both old and modern, can be found throughout the city.

The Promenade Deck and the Terrazza Umberto I were designed in 1896 by the engineers Joseph Costa and Fulgenzio Setti. The entire building was built of white and yellow limestone in a classical style with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian columns]]. It was opened in 1901. A staircase with two flights provides access from Constitution Square. It is interrupted by a covered walkway and ends beneath the Arc de Triomphe, in the Terrazza Umberto I. In 1943, during World War II, the staircase and the Arch of Triumph were severely damaged by aerial bombardment, but after the conflict they were faithfully reconstructed.

From the Terrazza Umberto I the Bastion of Santa Caterina can be accessed via a short flight of steps. Here there was once an old Dominican convent, destroyed by fire in 1800. According to tradition, the conspiracy to kill the Viceroy Camarassa in 1666 was set up in the surroundings of the monastery.
[[File:Liberty Cagliari.png|thumb|[[Art Nouveau]] architecture in Cagliari]]
The Promenade Deck was inaugurated in 1902. At first it was used as a banqueting hall, then during the First World War as an infirmary. In the 1930s, during the period of sanctions, it was an exhibition of [[autarky]] {{citation needed|date=July 2014}} During World War II it served as a shelter for displaced people whose homes had been destroyed by bombs. In 1948 it hosted the first Trade Fair of Sardinia. After many years of decay, the Promenade was restored and re-evaluated as a cultural space reserved especially for art exhibitions.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dozzo |first=Alessia |date=2020-09-07 |title=Bastion of Saint Remy, history of one of Cagliari's symbols |url=https://www.cagliarimag.com/tourist-attractions/bastion-of-saint-remy-cagliari/?lang=en |access-date=2024-02-13 |website=Cagliarimag.com |language=en-US}}</ref> 

The modern districts built in the late 19th and early 20th century contain examples of [[Art Deco]] architecture, as well as controversial examples of Fascist [[neoclassicism]] architecture, such as the Court of Justice (''Palazzo di Giustizia'') in Republic Square. The Court of Justice is near the biggest city park, Monte Urpinu, with its pine trees, artificial lakes, and a vast area with a hill. The [[Orto Botanico dell'Universit√† di Cagliari]], the city's botanical garden, is also of interest.

==Culture==
[[File:OldUniversityLibraryCagliari.jpg|thumb|18th-century University Library]]

The city has numerous libraries and is also home to the State Archive, containing thousands of handwritten documents from the foundation of the Kingdom of Sardinia (1325 AD) to the present. In addition to numerous local and university department libraries, the most important libraries are the old University Library,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sardegna.beniculturali.it/index.php?it/267/biblioteche/22/biblioteca-universitaria-di-cagliari |title= Biblioteche - Direzione regionale beni culturali e paesaggistici della Sardegna|website=www.sardegna.beniculturali.it |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909052702/http://www.sardegna.beniculturali.it/index.php?it%2F267%2Fbiblioteche%2F22%2Fbiblioteca-universitaria-di-cagliari |archive-date=9 September 2013}}</ref> with thousands of ancient books, the Provincial Library,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.provincia.cagliari.it/ProvinciaCa/it/bibliotecaprovincialeragazzi2.page |title=Provincia di Cagliari &#124; Biblioteca Provinciale Ragazzi |publisher=Provincia.cagliari.it |access-date=3 May 2015 |archive-date=5 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205065630/http://www.provincia.cagliari.it/ProvinciaCa/it/bibliotecaprovincialeragazzi2.page |url-status=dead }}</ref> the Regional Library,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sardegnabiblioteche.it/biblioteche/regionale.html |title=Sardegna Biblioteche - Attivit√† - Biblioteca regionale |publisher=Sardegnabiblioteche.it |access-date=3 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204082452/http://www.sardegnabiblioteche.it/biblioteche/regionale.html |archive-date=4 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and the Mediateca of the Mediterranean,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comune.cagliari.it/portale/it/scheda_sito.page;jsessionid=D5874DE00B5FEC3C5BBFC82F31F14F90?contentId=SIT662 |title=Comune di Cagliari&#124; MEM - Mediateca del Mediterraneo: Biblioteca Comunale Generale e di Studi Sardi - Archivio Storico - Mediateca |publisher=Comune.cagliari.it |access-date=3 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209164310/http://www.comune.cagliari.it/portale/it/scheda_sito.page%3Bjsessionid%3DD5874DE00B5FEC3C5BBFC82F31F14F90?contentId=SIT662 |archive-date=9 February 2015 }}</ref> which contains the municipal archive and library collection.

In the first century B.C. a famous singer and musician from Cagliari, Tigellius, lived in Rome and was satirized by [[Cicero]] and [[Horace]]. The history of Sardinian literature begins in Cagliari in the first century A.D. In the funerary monument of Atilia Pomptilla, carved into the rock of the necropolis of Tuvixeddu, poems are engraved in Greek and Latin dedicated to his dead wife. Some of them, particularly those in the Greek language, have literary merit.

The first Sardinian literary author known was Bishop [[Lucifer of Cagliari]], who wrote severe pamphlets against the [[Arian heresy]] in the fourth century A.D. Only in the eleventh century A.D. did the first texts of an administrative nature appear in the modern [[Sardinian language]], together with [[Hagiography|hagiographies]] of local martyrs written in Latin.

Life in Cagliari has been depicted by many writers, starting with the late Roman poet [[Claudian]]. In the late 16th century, the local humanist Roderigo Hunno Baeza dedicated to his town a didactic Latin poem, ''Caralis Panegyricus''.<ref>Miscellaneous codex preserved in the Civic Library of Cagliari, edited by Francesco Alziator, 1954</ref> At the beginning of the 17th century Juan Francisco Carmona wrote a hymn to Cagliari in Spanish; Jacinto Arnal De Bolea published in 1636, in Spanish, the first novel set in Cagliari, entitled ''El Forastero''.<ref>Jacinto Arnal de Bolea, El Forastero, Emprenta A. Galgerin, C√†ller, 1636, republished by the editor Mar√¨a Dolores, Garc√¨a S√†nchez, CFS/CUEC, Cagliari, 2011</ref> [[D.H. Lawrence|David Herbert Lawrence]] wrote about the city in his ''[[Sea and Sardinia]]''.

Modern writers connected to Cagliari include [[Giuseppe Dess√¨]], [[Giulio Angioni]], [[Giorgio Todde]], [[Sergio Atzeni]], (who set many of his novels and short stories, such as ''Bakunin's Son'', in ancient and modern Cagliari), [[Flavio Soriga]].
[[File:Lirico Cagliari.jpg|thumb|right|The new Teatro Lirico (opera house)]]

Cagliari was the birthplace or residence of the composer [[Ennio Porrino]], of the film, theatre and TV director [[Nanni Loy]], and of the actors [[Gianni Agus]], [[Amedeo Nazzari]] and [[Pier Angeli]] (born Anna Maria Pierangeli).

Excluding the Roman era amphitheater, the first theater was inaugurated in Cagliari in 1767: the Teatro Zapata, later becoming the Civic Theatre. Devastated by bombing in 1943, it was recently restored, but the roof was not rebuilt, and today it serves as an open-air theatre. The Politeama Regina Margherita, inaugurated in 1859, was destroyed by fire in 1942 and never rebuilt.

Although [[opera]] had, and in part still has, a solid tradition the city, it was left without a true theater until 1993 when a new opera house, the [[Teatro Lirico di Cagliari|Teatro Lirico]], was inaugurated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teatroliricodicagliari.it/ |title=Teatro Lirico Web-site |publisher=Teatroliricodicagliari.it |access-date=20 April 2010}}</ref> Inside there is a music compound with a music conservatory with its own auditorium, and a music park. Cagliari is and was home to opera singers such as the [[tenor]]s [[Giovanni Matteo Mario]] (Giovanni Matteo De Candia, 1810‚Äì1883) and Piero Schiavazzi (1875‚Äì1949), the [[baritone]] Angelo Romero (born 1940), the [[contralto]] [[Bernadette Manca di Nissa]], born 1954 and the [[soprano]] Giusy Devinu (1960‚Äì2007).

The Italian pop singer [[Marco Carta]] was also born in Cagliari, in 1985.

The old Teatro Massimo was only recently renovated and is now the seat of the Teatro Stabile of Sardinia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teatrostabiledellasardegna.it/index.php/spazi/teatro-massimo.html |title= Teatro Massimo di Cagliari|website=www.teatrostabiledellasardegna.it |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908160900/http://www.teatrostabiledellasardegna.it/index.php/spazi/teatro-massimo.html |archive-date=8 September 2013}}</ref> The Municipal Auditorium, in the former 17th-century church of Santa Teresa, is the seat of the Scuola di Arte Drammatica (School of Dramatic Art) di Cagliari,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scuoladiteatrocagliari.it/ |title=Scuola d'Arte Drammatica Cagliari - Tetatro stabile d'arte contemporanea Akr√≤ama |publisher=Scuoladiteatrocagliari.it |access-date=3 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509073258/http://www.scuoladiteatrocagliari.it/ |archive-date=9 May 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> while the Teatro delle Saline ("Saltworks Theatre"),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teatrodellesaline.it/ |title=Teatro delle Saline |publisher=Teatrodellesaline.it |access-date=3 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507030504/http://www.teatrodellesaline.it/ |archive-date=7 May 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> is home of Akroama, Teatro Stabile di Innovazione ("Permanent Theater of Innovation").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.akroama.it |title=Akr√≤ama T.L.S. - Contemporary Art Theatre |publisher=Akroama.it |access-date=3 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427012002/http://www.akroama.it/ |archive-date=27 April 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Feast of Sant'Efis===
[[File:Mazziere del Comune di Cagliari.jpg|thumb|left|Municipal mace bearer]]
[[File:Costumi sardi.jpg|thumb|220px|Traditional folk costume of Cagliari during the Feast of St. Ephysius]]
The Feast of [[St. Ephysius]] (Sant'Efisio in Italian, Sant'Efis in Sardinian) is the most important religious event of Cagliari, taking place every year on 1 May. During this festival, thousands of people from folk groups all over Sardinia wear their traditional costumes. The saint is escorted by the traditional ancient ''Milicia'', the deputy mayor (Alter Nos), numerous confraternities, and a convoy of chariots pulled by oxen in a procession to Nora (near modern Pula), {{convert|35|km|0|abbr=on}} from Cagliari, where, according to tradition, he was beheaded. In addition to being one of the oldest, it is also the longest Italian religious procession, with about {{convert|70|km|0|abbr=on}} of walks over four days, and the largest in the Mediterranean area.

A plague was spreading throughout Sardinia, starting in 1652, and the epidemic infected Cagliari in particular, killing some ten thousand inhabitants. According to legend, in 1656 St. Ephysius appeared to the Spanish Viceroy, [[Francisco Fern√°ndez de Castro Andrade, Count of Lemos]] to request a procession on 1 May, in order to free the city from the plague. The Municipality of Cagliari swore that, if the plague disappeared, a procession would be held every day in the saint's honor, starting from the Stampace district and ending at Nora where the saint was martyred. In September the plague ended, and the procession and festival was therefore regularly held starting the following year on 1 May. The procession was held even during the last war; a statue of the saint was placed on a lorry and, through city ruins of the devastated by the bombs, arrived safely in Nora.

===Other events===
Other feasts and events in Cagliari include:
*The Carnival
*Holy Week and Easter celebrations
*Sea processions of St. Francis of Paola, held in May, and Nostra Signora di Bonaria, in July
*Cagliari Fair, in early May
*[[Audi MedCup]] regatta

===Languages===
{{main|Sardinian language|Campidanese dialect}}
The native language of Cagliari, declared official along with Italian,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.sardiniapost.it/politica/cagliari-il-sardo-diventa-lingua-ufficiale-si-del-consiglio-al-nuovo-statuto/| title = Cagliari, il sardo diventa lingua ufficiale: il Consiglio dice s√¨ al nuovo Statuto - Sardiniapost| date = 3 November 2015}}</ref> is [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] (''sardu''), a [[Romance language]], specifically the [[Campidanese dialect]] (''campidanesu'') in its local variant (''casteddaju'').

The variant of Cagliari in its high register has traditionally represented the linguistic model of reference for the entire southern area of the island, and the high social variant used by the middle class in the whole Campidanese domain, as well as the literary model of reference for writers and poets. This language is less spoken by the younger generations in the city, who use Italian instead as that language is compulsory in education and the mass media. Italian has increasingly become predominant in social relations, both formal and informal, relegating Sardinian to a mostly marginal role in everyday life. Young people often have only passive competence in the language, gathered from elderly relatives who still speak it, as their parents often speak only Italian, or they may use a slang (''[[Regional Italian#Sardinia|italianu porceddinu]]'') that mixes both Sardinian and Italian.

Since Cagliari was the metropolis of the ancient Roman province, it absorbed innovations coming from Rome, Carthage, and Constantinople, and its language probably reflected late Latin urban dialects of the 5th-century core cities of the empire.

[[File:Sea food Cagliari.jpg|thumb|Seafood offered in a Cagliari restaurant]]

===Gastronomy===
Cagliari has some unique gastronomic traditions: unlike the rest of the island its cuisine is mostly based on the wide variety of locally available [[seafood]]. Although it is possible to trace influences from [[Catalan cuisine|Catalan]], [[Sicilian cuisine|Sicilian]] and Genoese cuisine, Cagliaritan food has a distinctive and unique character.

Excellent [[wine]]s are also part of Cagliaritanians' dinners, like the [[Grenache|Cannonau]], [[Nuragus di Cagliari|Nuragus]], [[Nasco di Cagliari|Nasco]], [[Monica (grape)|Monica]], Moscau, [[Gir√≤ di Cagliari|Gir√≤]] and Malvasia, produced in the nearby vineyards of the Campidano plain.

==Media==
The main newspaper of Sardinia is ''[[L'Unione Sarda]]'', it was founded in Cagliari in 1889. It was one of the first European newspapers to have its own website in 1994. It has a circulation of about 85,000 copies.

The main regional headquarters of [[RAI]], the Italian state-owned radio and television network, is in Cagliari. There are also two regional television and radio companies as well as numerous information sites on the internet.

==Sports==
[[File:SardegnaArena.jpeg|thumb|right|220px|Internal view of the [[Unipol Domus]], home of [[Serie A]] football club [[Cagliari Calcio]] since 2017]]
Cagliari is home to the football team [[Cagliari Calcio]], winner of the [[1969-70 Serie A|Italian league championship in 1970]], when the team was led by [[Gigi Riva]]. Founded in 1920, the club played at the [[Stadio Sant'Elia]] in the city from 1970 until it was closed in the summer of 2017, causing the club to temporarily relocate to the provisional [[Sardegna Arena]] (now Unipol Domus). Sant'Elia was the venue for three [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] matches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/international/tournaments/fifa-world-cup/1990/1990-group-f.html |title=FIFA World Cup 1990 - Group F - Historical Football Kits |publisher=Historicalkits.co.uk |access-date=3 May 2015}}</ref>

Cagliari is an ideal location for water sports such as [[surfing]], [[kitesurfing]], [[windsurfing]] and [[sailing]] due to strong and reliable favourable winds. [[Field hockey]] is also popular, with two teams in the Italian top division, G.S. Amsicora and C.U.S. Cagliari, the first of which won the league title more often than any other Italian team in the men's championship (20) and is also the protagonist in the women's division.

Cagliari is home to all criminal, civil, administrative and accounting courts for Sardinia of the Ministry of Justice up to the High Court of Assizes of Appeal. It was home to a prison, Buon Cammino, built in the late 19th century, famous because no one has ever managed to escape. A new modern prison has been built in the nearby town of Uta.

Traditionally, votes in Cagliari are oriented towards the center-right wing. Since World War II, all the mayors belonged to the [[Democrazia Cristiana|Christian Democracy]] party with the exception of Salvatore Ferrara, from the Socialist Party, allied with the former. After the collapse of the traditional parties in the 1990s, the mayors belonged to the party or the coalition led by [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. The current economic and political crisis that affects Italy has prompted the electorate toward a large abstention and to elect a young mayor, Massimo Zedda, who belongs to a centre-left alliance. In the last municipal elections in June 2016, Massimo Zedda was confirmed in the first round with 50.86% of the votes.

==Education==
[[File:Universit√†CA.jpg|thumb|250px|"Aula Magna" of the University of Cagliari]]
Cagliari is home to the [[University of Cagliari]],<ref name="Unica"/> the largest public university in Sardinia, founded in 1626. It currently includes six faculties: Engineering and Architecture, Medicine and Surgery, Economics, Juridical and Political Sciences, Basic Sciences, Biology and Pharmacy, Humanistic Studies.

It is attended by about 35,000 students.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.censismaster.it/media/ClassificheAtenei2012 |title=Classifica Atenei Statali 2012 |publisher=Censismaster.it |access-date=3 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204105705/http://www.censismaster.it/media/ClassificheAtenei2012 |archive-date=4 February 2015 }}</ref> All science faculties of the university, as well as the university hospital, have been transferred to a new "University Citadel", located in Monserrato. Cagliari's downtown houses the engineering and the humanities divisions and, in the Castle, the seat of the Rector, in an 18th-century palace with a library of thousands of ancient books.

Cagliari is also the seat of the [[Pontifical Faculty of Theology of Sardinia]] and of the [[Istituto Europeo di Design|European Institute of Design]].

Life expectancy in Cagliari is high: 79.5 years for men and 85.4 for women (provincial level).

There has been a public hospital in Cagliari since the 17th century. The first modern structure was built in the middle of the 19th century, designed by the architect [[Gaetano Cima]]. This hospital is still operating, although all its departments will eventually be transferred to the new University Hospital<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aoucagliari.it/index.php?xsl=21&s=10&v=9&c=2785&esn=Primo+piano&na=1&n=100&o=1 |title=AouCagliari - Presidi sanitari - Presidio Policlinico Monserrato |publisher=Aoucagliari.it |access-date=3 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402104713/http://www.aoucagliari.it/index.php?xsl=21&s=10&v=9&c=2785&esn=Primo+piano&na=1&n=100&o=1 |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> in Monserrato.
