'''Tarapoto''' is a commercial hub town in the [[San Martín Province]] of the [[Department of San Martín]] of northern [[Peru]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KUgiAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA518|title=Trade Promotion Series|date=1925|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=518|language=en}}</ref> It is an hour by plane from Lima, in the high jungle plateau to the east of what is known as the ''selva baja'' (low jungle). Although [[Moyobamba]] is the capital of the region, Tarapoto is the region's largest city and is linked to the [[Upper Amazon]] and the historic city of [[Yurimaguas]] by a relatively well-maintained transandean highway, paved in 2008–9.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tarapoto.com/tarapoto/|title=Tarapoto Peru in San Martin - Tarapoto.com San Martín Perú|website=www.tarapoto.com}}</ref>

Tarapoto is approximately {{convert|356|m|abbr=out}} above sea level on the high jungle plateau, also called the cloud forest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tarapoto.com/servicios/ubicacion.php|title=Ubicacion de la Ciudad de Tarapoto Peru|website=www.tarapoto.com}} (in Spanish)</ref> It was founded in 1782 by [[Baltasar Jaime Martínez Compañón]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Vergara|first=Alexis Rolando Arévalo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8zKIDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP13|title=Revista de la Academia Sanmartinense de Heráldica y Genealogía N° 1: Los vecinos fundadores de Tarapoto (1782-1802)/Descendencia del Tnte.

Tarapoto is often used by tourists and local visitors as a base for excursions into the vast [[Amazon Rainforest]]. The region's main activities are tourism, commerce, agriculture, and an illicit "shadow economy" that includes production of coca leaves, lately in decline, extraction of lumber, and trading in land concessions.

Tarapoto is home to the Universidad Nacional de San Martín, an important center of higher education serving the professional and technical needs of a region of high biodiversity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fudes-unsm.org/|title=Info at fudes-unsm.org}}</ref> With its active nightlife, Tarapoto offers a wide variety of hotels and restaurants in and around the city. Moreover, the area's beautiful landscapes, [[waterfall]]s and lagoons form a tempting location for adventure tourism, such as river rafting and hiking in the tropical Andes, and attract numerous visitors to the "City of Palms".

The City of Palm Trees, concentrates a large part of the tourist and commercial activity in the region, being the third most sought after and visited city by Peruvians, after Lima and Cusco; It is surrounded to the north by the regional conservation area of the Cordillera Escalera within the South American tropical rainforest and to the south by a fertile valley with crops of [[rice]], [[Maize|corn]], [[coffee]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[tobacco]] and various agricultural products, with seasonally dry forests.

The city is a nerve center of agricultural products, the surroundings concentrate a wide endemic [[biodiversity]], originating from the last foothills of the eastern [[Andes]], these give rise to an enormous botanical and biological wealth, of an incredible variety of amphibian and bird species. ideal for birdwatching, in addition to a large number of waterfalls, this gave rise to the growth of ecotourism, mainly since the mid-1990s.

Currently, the Amazonian metropolis has several hypermarket chains, with all kinds of services, multiplexes, first-class [[hospital]]s, [[High-speed Internet|high-speed internet]], hotel services, [[luxury resorts]], hotels of all categories; The land connection in the mid-1960s brought with it enormous economic and demographic growth to the city, as a result of the construction and paving of access roads, from the capital city, [[Lima]], connecting to the central highway in the central highlands and /or with the [[Fernando Belaúnde|Fernando Belaunde Terry]] highway through Pasco and [[Huánuco|Huanuco]]; and in the north interconnected to the cities of Bagua, [[Chachapoyas, Peru|Chachapoyas]], [[Chiclayo]], [[Piura]] and [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], and with proximity to the largest port in northern Peru, the port of Paita on the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the port of Salaverry in La Libertad, in addition to a connection to [[Brazil]] through the river port of [[Yurimaguas]], just 3 hours away by road, and its exit to the Atlantic through the [[Huallaga River]], a tributary of the Marañón River and this of the [[Amazon River]].

== History ==
[[File:Plano topografico de la ciudad de Tarapoto por Antonio Raimoni 1874.jpg|left|thumb|Map of Tarapoto by Antonio Raimoni 1874]]
Tarapoto was founded on August 20, 1782, by the Spanish bishop [[Baltasar Jaime Martínez Compañón]].<ref name=":0" /> Its beginnings date back to the explorations of the [[Pocras]] and [[Chancas]] (old cultures of the [[Ayacucho]] region) who, when being conquered by the [[Inca Empire]], headed a revolution led by the commander Ancohallo; a revolt that, when defeated, forced their tribal members to escape from terrible Inca vengeance.

Eventually settling down in the valleys of the Mayo and Cumbaza rivers, in what is now the [[Department of San Martín]], they possibly formed the town of [[Lamas, Peru|Lamas]], before establishing a satellite in the valley of the rivers Cumbaza and Shilcayo, having as a central nucleus the Suchiche Lagoon (dried up in the colony). In this lagoon grew abundant ''Taraputus'' palms, a name that the Spanish bishop would later use when founding the city in this area of hunters and fishermen.

The city is located in the valleys of the Cumbaza and Shilcayo rivers, and is the center of the terrestrial networks and areas between the mountains, the coast and eastern Peru.

The annual average temperature is {{convert|25.7|°C|1}}. The average rainfall in Tarapoto is {{convert|1162.2|mm|1}} per year.

In May, the Amazon River, one of the rivers surrounding the city, reaches its highest levels.

==Access and transportation==

=== Air ===
Tarapoto is one hour by air from Lima and is served by the [[Cad. FAP Guillermo del Castillo Paredes Airport]]. This airport is the third-most important in the Peruvian rainforest in flow of passengers and cargo. It operates flights to and from Lima on a daily basis, as well as being a stopover to other cities, such as [[Iquitos]], [[Pucallpa]] and [[Chiclayo]], from Lima.

=== Road ===
Lima can be reached by bus in approximately 28 hours. The route runs through [[Moyobamba]] and Pedro Ruiz before passing through the coastal city of [[Chiclayo]].

Taxis and motorized rickshaws are frequently used as an inexpensive mode of transportation throughout Tarapoto. Due to the types of the engines used in many taxis, main intersections in Tarapoto are extremely noisy, especially at times of busy traffic. However recently there has been an attempt to certify rickshaws that abide by noise pollution standards.

==Local food==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2023}}
In Tarapoto one can enjoy the most varied food typical of the jungle region. The area is famous for ''juane'', made with rice, egg, olive and chicken, all wrapped up in leaves of [[Calathea|bijao]]. Cured pork products are also common, most notably ''cecina'' and ''chorizo'' sausage.

Tarapoto is considered the gastronomic capital of the Peruvian Amazon, its enormous variety of typical dishes is the result of the intense miscegenation between the native indigenous cultures of the Amazon, European immigration, Japanese and Chinese immigration (the latter brought rice at the end of the century XIX and at the beginning of the XX century, intensifying its cultivation in the agricultural zone of the city), for which Tarapoto is the cradle of the Amazon gastronomy of Peru for being much older than the cities of Iquitos and Pucallpa, in the city you can enjoy the most varied typical foods of the jungle. Its shrimps are famous, those that are enjoyed in the ninajuanes; the well-known juane, made from rice, eggs, olives and chicken meat, wrapped in bijao leaves, as well as the exquisite chorizo and cecina that have been industrialized and are currently exported to large supermarkets throughout the country.
