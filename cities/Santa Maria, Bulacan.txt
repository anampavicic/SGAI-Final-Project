'''Santa Maria''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|æ|n|t|ə|_|m|ə|ˈ|r|iː|ə}} {{respell|SAN|tə|_|mə|REE|ə}}, {{IPA|tl|ˈsantɐ mɐˈɾija|lang}}), officially the '''Municipality of Santa Maria''' ({{lang-tgl|Bayan ng Santa Maria}}), is a 1st class [[Greater Manila Area|urban]] [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Bulacan]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 289,820 people.{{PH census|current}} representing 7.8% of the population of the province.

Located on the banks of the [[Santa Maria River (Philippines)|Santa Maria River]], {{convert|32|km|mi|1}} north of [[Manila]], Santa Maria has been a thriving settlement for almost four centuries. It was founded as a ''[[barrio]]'' of [[Bocaue]] in the early 17th century until it was established as an independent municipality on November 26, 1793, by the [[Spanish Friars in Colonial Philippines|Spanish friar]] Francisco Dominguez Javier [[Franciscan|OFM]]. Known before as ''Santa Maria de Pandi'' ({{IPA|tl|pɐnˈde}}), it is named under the patronage of the [[Virgin Mary|Immaculate Conception]] (also known as La Purisima Concepcion). Its administrative center, the [[Poblacion]], forms the historic core of the municipality. It is surrounded by four rivers and it still largely retains its 2.88 square-kilometer boundaries since the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish Colonial Era]].

Santa Maria, with a population of 289,820, remains by a significant margin the most populous [[Philippine municipality|municipality]] in [[Central Luzon]], as well as the [[List of Philippine cities and municipalities by population|7th most populous]] municipality in the [[Philippines]]. It is also the 2nd most populous local government unit in [[Bulacan]] next to [[San Jose del Monte City]]. The projected population for 2025 was 305,668.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.doh.gov.ph/sites/default/files/publications/Population%20Projections%20by%20Region%2C%20Province%2C%20Cities%20and%20Municipalities%2C%202020-2025.pdf|title=Doh Population Projections by Region, Province, City/Municipality and Barangay from 2020–2025|access-date=February 5, 2021}}</ref> There are 142,380 registered voters in the municipality.

It is also one of Bulacan's leading financial centers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} According to the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] (BSP) and the [[Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (PDIC), Santa Maria's total bank deposits reached [[Philippine Peso|PHP]] 31.27&nbsp;billion as of December 2021, this accounts for almost 75% of Eastern [[Bulacan]]'s total bank deposits.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pdic.gov.ph/files/BSDStats/DDD_PBS_ProvinceMunicipality.htm|title=PHILIPPINE DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION : PHILIPPINE BANKING SYSTEM DISTRIBUTION OF DOMESTIC a/ DEPOSITS |date=June 30, 2016 |website=Pdic.gov.ph |access-date=December 15, 2016}}</ref> Likewise, Santa Maria is the richest municipality in [[Bulacan]] with an assets totaling to [[Philippine Peso|PHP]] 1.87&nbsp;billion and revenues reaching an all-time high of [[Philippine Peso|PHP]] 1.206 billion as of the 2022 report from the [[Commission on Audit of the Philippines|Commission on Audit]] (COA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coa.gov.ph/index.php/local-government-units/2015/category/5798-municipalities |title=Commission on Audit – Bulacan |website=Coa.gov.ph |access-date=December 15, 2016}}</ref> It has a relatively high standard of living, with only 4% of the population living in poverty which is one of the lowest in the country (19 out of 1,489 municipalities).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://psa.gov.ph/sites/default/files/2012%20SAE_final_1.xlsx |title=2012 City and Municipal-Level Small Area Poverty Estimates |website=Psa.gov.ph |access-date=December 15, 2016}}</ref>

Santa Maria was the home town of [[José Corazón de Jesús]], a Filipino poet popularly known as "''Huseng Batute''", who started composing his verse as a child.  Another native of Santa Maria is [[Francisco Santiago]], a composer who wrote "''Nasaan Ka Irog''" and other kundiman songs. In the political arena, Santa Maria has produced three [[Governor of Bulacan|Bulacan governors]]: Jose Serapio (1900–1901), Trinidad Icasiano (1912–1916), Fortunato Halili (1943–1944 and 1946–1951); and three representatives of the [[Legislative districts of Bulacan|second]], [[Legislative districts of Bulacan|fourth district]], and [[Legislative districts of Bulacan|sixth district]]: Rogaciano Mercado (1953–1972, 1987-1989),  [[Reylina Nicolas]] (2001–2010) and Salvador "Ka Ador" Pleyto (2022 to present).

== Etymology ==

Santa Maria got its name from the Immaculate Conception (also known as La Purisima Concepcion). Formerly known as Santa Maria de Pandi, the second name Pandi was derived from [[:wikt:pande#Kapampangan|''pande'']], [[kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] word of "blacksmith," cognate of Tagalog word "[[:wikt:panday|panday]]."

== History ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}

=== Pre colonial (before 1521) ===

Before the [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] came to the [[Philippines]], Santa Maria was just a vast wilderness, inhabited by wild animals and covered by thick and lush rainforests. [[Aeta people|Aetas]] and Dumagats are also known to inhabit the place a long time ago.

=== Spanish Era (1521–1898) ===

Santa Maria's existence can be traced as early as the year 1647 when it is still a ''barrio'' (village) of [[Bocaue, Bulacan|Bocaue]]. The ''barrio'' was believed to be established on the same period when the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] founded the vast Hacienda de Lolomboy that extends up to the [[Angat, Bulacan|Angat river]] on the north, [[Bocaue, Bulacan|Bocaue river]] on the west, [[Marilao, Bulacan|Marilao river]] on the south and the Pulo River (Pulong Buhangin) on the east.

Santa Maria was founded as an independent town by the [[Franciscan]] Fray Francisco Dominguez Javier on November 26, 1793. He began constructing the church which was completed in the early 1800s by Fray Tomas Marti. The construction of the church was viewed as the foundation of the spiritual crusade in the said locality. Natives were converted into Christianity and more people began to inhabit the place. Civil affairs started to take shape and the appointment of the first Capitan del Barrio, Andres dela Cruz, paved way for the permanent establishment of Poblacion, which was the seat of Spanish colonial government. People in those days were just renting their pieces of land. They paid their rents to the friars who were stationed in what is now known as Sta. Clara, a barangay where at present one can see the ruins of a big convento of friars. People from other nearby places such as [[Balagtas, Bulacan|Balagtas]], [[Pandi, Bulacan|Pandi]], Santa Maria, and [[San Jose del Monte]], paid their rents in this convento. Santa Maria at that time was then called "Santa Maria de Pandi". The people acquired their lands after paying certain sum to the friars and the land became "Lupang Tagalog".

There were 82 capitanes who served the Spanish colonial administration from 1793 to 1899.

=== American Era and Japanese Occupation (1898–1946) ===
Under the Americans, the title "captain" was changed to "presidente". The first to hold the position was Maximo Evidente, who served from 1899 to 1900. Of the 12 others who succeeded him, the most popular were Agustin Morales (1928–34) and Fortunato F. Halili (1934–37). Morales was responsible for the construction of the first main water system in the town. Halili, who never drew his salary as executive, later on became Governor of Bulacan. It was during Halili's term as provincial governor when the Capitol building at [[Malolos, Bulacan|Malolos]] was heavily damage due to the aftermath of [[World War II]]. He decided to take over and resurge Casa Real de Malolos as a temporary Gubernatorial Office during the period when the Capitol building was severely damaged. It was his effort to rebuild and to reconstruct the Capitol building into its original structure.

During the Japanese Occupation, Dr. Teofilo Santiago, dubbed as ''Dr. Kamoteng Kahoy'' for his widespread campaign among the town's citizenry to plant cassava, became mayor of Santa Maria. Santiago was also responsible for the launching of the poultry industry – a livelihood project which earned for the town the distinction of being "The Egg Basket of the Philippines". He was also the "Father of Santa Maria Dairy Plant". After the Liberation, Capitan Ireneo Hermogenes was appointed Municipal Mayor from March 20, 1945, to October 1945. He was succeeded by Marciano Bautista.

From the American colonial rule until the restoration period after World War II, Santa Maria was administered by 12 Presidentes from 1899 to 1937 and 4 Alcaldes from 1938 to 1947.

=== Liberation period (1947–present) ===
The post-liberation period saw Conrado Ignacio as the first elected Mayor of Santa Maria (1947–1955). He was succeeded by prominent personalities in Santa Maria local politics such as Ricardo G. Nicolas Sr. (1956–1959/1964–1967), Eriberto Ramos, Sr. (1960–1963), Paulino M. Luciano Sr. (1968–1971), Ricardo D. Nicolas, Jr.(1972–1978) and Paulino Luciano, Jr. (1979–1986).

After the [[People Power Revolution]] in February 1986, President [[Corazon Aquino]] appointed Dr. Alfredo Perez, who was then the vice mayor of the town, as Officer-in-Charge of the municipality until May 1986, when he was replaced by Ricardo Nicolas, Jr. In December 1986, however, Nicolas was appointed OIC Vice Governor of Bulacan and was succeeded by Benjamin G. Geronimo (1987–1988) and Atty. Ramon H. Clemente (1988).

During the 1988 elections, Eriberto Ramos was elected Mayor and served until June 30, 1992. On July 1, 1992, he was succeeded by Reylina G. Nicolas. Her three terms of leadership gave the municipality various awards and citations. On July 1, 1993, the municipality rose from third class to second-class municipality and July 1, 1996, the income level of the municipality rose again from second-class municipality to first-class municipality. In the 2001 elections, Nicolas ran for Representative of the 4th Congressional District of Bulacan and won a landslide victory with more than 80,000 votes over her closest rival. Nicolas was succeeded by [[Bartolome Ramos|Bartolome R. Ramos]].

During the 2004 elections, Jesus Mateo defeated the incumbent Ramos and became mayor of the municipality until 2007. One of Mateo's accomplishments as mayor of Santa Maria was the establishment of the [[Polytechnic University of the Philippines Santa Maria|Santa Maria extension campus]] of the [[Polytechnic University of the Philippines]] in 2005. In [[2007 Philippine Elections|2007 elections]], [[Bartolome Ramos|Bartolome R. Ramos]] defeated Mateo and became mayor of the municipality again.

{{Main|Geography of Santa Maria, Bulacan}}
[[File:SMB Riverbanks.jpg|thumb|The [[Santa Maria River (Philippines)|Santa Maria River]] is the 2nd largest river in [[Bulacan]] by water volume and the 4th longest.]]
[[File:SMB Ricefields.jpg|thumb|A [[paddy field]] in Bulac. Agriculture remains a major source of income in the municipality.]]

The municipality of Santa Maria lies {{convert|32|km}} north-east of [[Manila]] and is located at the eastern portion of Bulacan. The town is bounded on the north by the municipalities of [[Angat, Bulacan|Angat]] and [[Pandi, Bulacan|Pandi]]; portion of [[San Jose del Monte City]] on the south; [[Norzagaray, Bulacan|Norzagaray]] and other portions of San Jose del Monte on the east; and the municipalities of [[Marilao, Bulacan|Marilao]] and [[Bocaue, Bulacan|Bocaue]] on the western side. Santa Maria is {{convert|18|km}} away from [[Malolos City]], the provincial capital, and {{convert|38|km}} from [[San Fernando, Pampanga]], the regional centre of [[Central Luzon]].

Santa Maria has a land area of about {{convert|9092.5|ha}}. The town is generally plain although hilly at the northern portion. It has a lone body of water – the Santa Maria River.

The topography of Santa Maria is generally flat, however, it is becoming hilly towards the north. This area covers the barangays of Silangan, Mag-asawang Sapa, Pulong Buhangin and some parts of Balasing with landscape ranging from 8 to 18 percent slope. The rest of the barangays have a slope range from level to undulating.

Most of the barangays in the municipality of Santa Maria have low susceptibility to flooding. Those with portion with moderate to high susceptibility to flooding are located along the Santa Maria River and near or adjacent to creeks that are tributaries of the Santa Maria River.<ref name="mgbr3.ph">{{cite web |url=http://www.mgbr3.ph/attachments/article/48/bulacan_exec%20summar.pdf |title=Archived copy |website=www.mgbr3.ph |access-date=13 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813152719/http://www.mgbr3.ph/attachments/article/48/bulacan_exec%20summar.pdf |archive-date=13 August 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The barangay centers and populated areas in the barangays have low susceptibility to flooding. The portions of the barangays usually inundated are the generally low-lying areas and catchment areas of the barangays and near active creeks and rivers.<ref name="mgbr3.ph"/>

Santa Maria was part of the 4th district of Bulacan along with Marilao, Meycauayan, and Obando from 1987 to 2022. It was moved to 6th district since 2021 along with neighboring municipalities Angat and Norzagaray.

=== Natural resources ===
Santa Maria, Bulacan, has abundant natural resources. It is renowned for its extensive deposits of gravel, sand, and volcanic tuff/ignimbrite (commonly known as adobe, lastillas, or escombro). Quarrying has become a significant means of living for the local population, where the abundant pyroclastic deposits from the Guadalupe Formation, such as tuff and ignimbrite in Santa Maria, are quarried for construction and decorative purposes.These valuable resources are indispensable in numerous sectors, such as construction, infrastructure development, and artistic pursuits.

=== Climate ===
Due to its location near [[Metro Manila]], rainfall and climate in Santa Maria is almost similar to the country's capital [[Manila]]. The location of Santa Maria in the western side of the [[Philippines]] made [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]] (PAG-ASA) to classify its weather scheme as ''Type I''. Wind coming from the Pacific Ocean is generally blocked by the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre mountain range]], a few kilometers east of the municipality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kidlat.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/cab/statfram.htm |title=Archived copy |website=kidlat.pagasa.dost.gov.ph |access-date=13 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030605203911/http://kidlat.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/cab/statfram.htm |archive-date=5 June 2003 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Its proximity to the equator tends to make its temperature to rise and fall into very small range: from as low as {{convert|19|C|F}} to as high as {{convert|35|C|F}}. The [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate system]] classifies Santa Maria climate as [[Tropical monsoon climate|tropical monsoon (''Am'')]] due to its location and precipitation characteristics. This means that the municipality has two pronounced seasons: dry and wet seasons. The municipality's driest months are from November to April where it receives less than {{convert|60|mm|in}} of rainfall. On the other hand, maximum rain period is from June to September where it receives not more than {{convert|600|mm|in}} of rainfall. Hail and snow is not observed in the municipality.

[[Relative humidity|Humidity]] levels are usually high in the morning, especially during June to November, which makes it feel warmer. Lowest humidity levels are recorded in the evening during wet season. Discomfort from heat and humidity is extreme during May and June, otherwise it is higher compared to other places in the country. Average sunlight is maximum at 254.25 hours during April and minimum at 113 hours during July, August and September.

=== Residential ===
There are about 45 subdivisions in the municipality of low, medium and high density category. The existing residential hub occupies 1,360&nbsp;hectares (13.60&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of land distributed unevenly in its 12 barangays. These subdivisions used to occupy the stretch of the roads but now they are now developing the inner portions of their [[barangay]]s. It is expected that within the next ten years, land use development in Santa Maria will represent the sub-urban mix which means that the government will provide development where the level of accessibility is very high. This will provide for the clustering of lower density land uses to help meet housing, employment and public services needs of the people.<ref name="Official Website of Santa Maria, Bulacan 2">{{cite web |url=http://www.santamariabulacan.gov.ph/about/residential.asp |title=Santa Maria, Bulacan, Philippines Official Website : Socio-Economic Profile - Residential |website=www.santamariabulacan.gov.ph |access-date=13 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619021440/http://www.santamariabulacan.gov.ph/about/residential.asp |archive-date=19 June 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Festivals ===

The town fiesta of Santa Maria in honor of its Patroness, the Purisima Concepcion is a month-long celebration in February which clearly shows the Marian devotion of the town. The movable feast is held on the Thursday after February 2 which tradition refers to as La Candelaria.

Throughout the month several other events are held such as musical variety shows led by popular personalities, outdoor sports exhibitions of nationally acclaimed players, concerts by well known bands and cultural shows.

Most notable during the month of February is the availability of "''Tuge''", a ready to eat root crop sold by vendors that signify the ambiance of the festivity together with the cool breeze which last right after the celebration of the town fiesta.
