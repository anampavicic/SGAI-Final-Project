'''Unveiling the congado history in Ituiutaba-MG'''

In Ituiutaba reportedly some Congadeiros, the festivities took place on farms outside the city where they also raised their suits. With the becoming of time, the festival has become known, was brought to the city. However, the parish priest of the time did not accept that Congadeiros walk into the church, prohibiting the holding of the festival site. This ban was because the Congadeiros, did not follow the Catholic religion, but others of African origin. Meanwhile, around Ituiutaba, to honor his wife Geralda Ramos da Silva on his birthday on April 2, 1951, Mr. Demetrio Silva da Costa (Cyzicus) invited his father Marciano Silvestre da Costa, his brother Gerard Clarimundo Coast and several other friends to play Mozambique and commemorate the date. Upon learning of the incident, Ana Carolina Ribeiro (Dona Rosa), cousin of Cyzicus, invited the group to work together to bring the suit in Mozambique Ituiutaba and rekindle the devotion to St. Benedict with much dancing, partying and devotion. So they went to the parish priest of the time, Father John Ave, to communicate it and ask him to leave, next to the church, making the feast of St. Benedict and Our Lady of the Rosary. The pastor, not allowed, claiming that the Church had problems previously with the suits Congado that formerly existed in Ituiutaba, and that because of these clashes, had already fragmentado. In 1952, the newly created suit, decided to rehearse in order placing the group properly uniformed street in protest against the attitude of the priest. They walked down the street 22 at 5 am. They made a dawn with fireworks in front of the Forum site getting the consent of justice to conduct the celebrations in the city. They went to St. Joseph Church, where he entered the enclosure and attended the morning mass. After the Congadeiros went visiting various residences singing, dancing saints protectors streets. In the following years the party happened without the existence of a fellowship or church support. Still, Congadeiros insisted on having the recognition of the celebration by the church, performing each year the festivities in honor of St. Benedict and Our Lady of the Rosary, with the support of the devotees and supporters. Years later, restructures itself in the Congado Ituiutaba.

The group now organized, lock arms with a drop of the pastor of the church, which is to make a series of these requirements to concede to the same space at the site. One of those requirements was that the Congadeiros really embrace the Catholic faith. Accepting the request of the priest they baptized, received first Eucharist, crismaram and those who were cohabiting, married in the Church. Another requirement was that the Congadeiros had active participation in religious ceremonies, just like that, the party would have some relationship with the Church. Thus the Catholic Church tried to erase their black African religious heritage, yet the Congadeiros although "Catholics" did not fail to keep their ancestral practices, even if secretly.

Before the completion of all requirements made by him, Father John Ave, in 1956, asked the Congadeiros to choose twelve couples among themselves who knew well the Catholic doctrines. Of these couples, men appointed by the priest as "The Twelve Apostles" (Marciano Silvestre da Costa, Clarimundo Geraldo da Costa, Demetrius Silva da Costa - Cyzicus, Antonio Belchior, Baldwin Anthony da Costa - Antonio Goat, Agenor Prudêncio do Nascimento, Andira Alves, Max Avelino da Costa, Jerome Ventura Keys-Dunga, Aristides da Silva, Antônio Manoel Gomes and Lord Edmund) founded the Brotherhood of St. Benedict according to the instructions of the pastor, who authorized, in 1957, the operation of the Brotherhood, by blaming it suits founded between the years 1951 to 1954 and by others who supposedly were to arise.

From the creation of the Brotherhood of St. Benedict groups Congado also now have their own religious group within the Church, which is replaced by function not only religious but also cultural, organizing and coordinating suits Congado of Ituiutaba. As listed in the Small History of the Brotherhood of St. Benedict, it was founded on 13 May 1957 with "special service" and "First Communion Benedictines of several young children and adults." It was through the creation of the Brotherhood of St. Benedict that Congadeiros won permission to celebrate in the Church. It was through her that they also raised capital to later buy the land and erect the Church of St. Benedict.

The Brotherhood was originally formed by just over 100 people; today it includes over 600 individuals. She has become the guarantee of Congadeiros "law of the Church"; their creation and foundation opened the doors to the consolidation of suits and became the foundation for what emerged. The feast in honor of St. Benedict is composed of seven suits Congado the participation of several others from the surrounding cities that participate in the celebrations for several years.
