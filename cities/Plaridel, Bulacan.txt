'''Plaridel''', officially the '''Municipality of Plaridel''' ({{lang-tgl|Bayan ng Plaridel}}, [[kapampangan language|Kapampangan]]: ''Balen ning Plaridel''), formerly known as '''Quingua,''' is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Bulacan]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 114,432 people.{{PH census|current}}

With the continuous expansion of [[Metro Manila]], Plaridel is part of [[Greater Manila Area|Manila's built-up area]] which reaches [[San Ildefonso, Bulacan]] at its northernmost part.

Plaridel is {{convert|18|km}} from [[Malolos]] and {{convert|41|km}} from [[Manila]].

==Name==
The name of the municipality the during Spanish and American colonial periods is ''Quingua.'' On December 29, 1936, a bill was passed and approved changing the town's name to ''Plaridel'', in honor of the great hero of Bulacan, [[Marcelo H. del Pilar]].

==History==
[[File:Quingua Marker, Plaridel, Bulacan, Mar 2024.jpg|left|thumb|Quingua Marker]]
Like many towns in Bulacan, Plaridel has its niche in Philippine history as the site of the '''[[Battle of Quingua]]''' during the [[Philippine–American War]] as part of the defense of the First Philippine Republic against the Northern Campaign of the American Army. The battle, manned by [[Pablo Tecson]]—Lt. Colonel Pablo Ocampo Tecson of [[San Miguel, Bulacan]]—under [[Gregorio del Pilar]] on the side of the First Philippine Republic, led to the death of [[John M. Stotsenburg|Col. John Stotsenberg]] of the American Army on April 23, 1899. A marker now stands at the site of the battle in [[barangay]] Agnaya.

Plaridel's history can be traced through records back to 1581 in the early years of the Spanish colonization. The Augustinian friars from the Malolos Convent discovered a vast forest in 1581 then named as Binto; this would later be known as Quingua. As per the history of the Parish of St. James the Apostle, 2001 issue, Quingua was established by the Augustinian Friars of Malolos who initially named it "Encomienda Binto" (Barangay Bintog got its name from this settlement). They built a ''visita'' ([[chapel of ease]]) and placed it under the jurisdiction of Fray Mateo Mendoza, the prior of Malolos.

The visita of Binto was elevated to an independent parish named Parroquia de Santiago Apostol, and the whole of Quingua was separated from Malolos and was created as a new pueblo on September 27, 1602.

Plaridel is traversed by the [[Angat River|Angat]] and formerly by Tabang River. The [[Angat River]], otherwise known as Quingua River, flows directly to [[Calumpit, Bulacan]], meeting the [[Pampanga River]]. The Tabang River is a distributary of the Angat River. It previously crosses Plaridel and divides into two bodies of water in the middle of the present-day [[poblacion]] of the municipality. It was intersected by the irrigation canal coming from [[Bustos Dam]] and flows toward [[Manila Bay]] after passing through the towns of [[Guiguinto, Bulacan|Guiguinto]] and [[Bulakan, Bulacan|Bulakan]]. The water of this river was called "tabáng," referring to its fresh water.

Initially very few people lived in the town, and most were closely related. Each group had a leader called "tandis". Different groups spoke different languages; [[Kapampangan language|Pampango]], [[Pangasinan language|Pangasinan]], [[Ilokano language|Ilocano]] and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]. From Malolos, the friar curate frequently visited the place, preaching the Catholic faith, using the "balsa" or bamboo raft as his means of transportation upriver and back through Angat River. The missionaries decided to clear the land and establish settlements, from which they could work to bring unity to the people. They needed ideas to bring this about, so each "tandis" drew up a plan to pursue. The groups of people labored, so much so that when the priest returned seven years later, he found the area completely cleared. The priests' party inquired among the natives as to whom the credit should go, and the Pampangos exclaimed, "Quing wawa". Thereafter, every now and then, to every question of the friars the people would reply "Quing wa". As a consequence, the place had come to be referred to as Quingua.

[[File:Landing Fields - Philippines - Plaridel through Panipuan - NARA - 68161100.jpg|thumb|Plaridel airfield in 1934]]
During the presidency of [[Manuel L. Quezon]], the then "Alcalde", or Town Mayor, of Quinga, Jose J. Mariano, took the initiative of renaming the town. [[Member of Congress|Representative]] <!--congressman or congresswoman --> Pedro Magsalin, a friend of the Alcalde, sponsored the bill changing the name of the town from Quingua to Plaridel. The bill was passed by the Philippine Congress and was approved by the President, and on December 29, 1936, the town was renamed as 'Plaridel', in honor of the great hero of Bulacan, [[Marcelo H. del Pilar]]. The celebrations that followed were attended by political luminaries of the time, including Speaker [[Gil Montilla]], Congressman Magsalin, Nicolas Buendia, [[Eulogio Rodriguez]], [[Elpidio Quirino]] and Governor [[José Padilla, Sr.|José Padilla, Sr]].

Notable families from Plaridel include the Vergel de Dios family (originally from Baliuag and that donated the public market of the town), the Garcías, the Buhains, and San Diegos.

==Geography==
===Barangays===
Plaridel is divided into 19 [[barangay]]s. In 1954, [[sitio]] Mayamot in Barrio Banga was changed to Bagong Silang<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra1005.html|title=An Act Changing the Name of the Sitio of Mayamot, Barrio of Banga, Municipality of Plaridel, Province of Bulacan, to Bagong Silang|publisher=LawPH.com|access-date=April 9, 2011}}</ref> while a sitio in the eastern part of barrio Tabang, called Bagong Silang, was created.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra1006.html|title=An Act Creating a Sitio in the Eastern Part of Barrio Tabang, Municipality of Plaridel, Province of Bulacan, to Be Known As the Sitio of Bagong Sikat|publisher=LawPH.com|access-date=April 9, 2011}}</ref> These barangays are headed by elected officials: [[Barangay Captain]], [[Sangguniang Barangay|Barangay Council]], whose members are called [[Barangay Kagawad|Barangay Councilors]].

[[File:Quingua Church, Plaridel, Bulacan, Mar 2024.jpg|thumb|Quingua Church built in 1602 is dedicated to the apostle [[James the Greater]], and named after [[Santiago de Compostela]] in [[Spain]].]]

===Parish Church of Santiago Apostol===
{{Main|Santiago Apostol Church (Plaridel)}}

The Plaridel Church was initially a mission chapel built by the Augustinians in Malolos made of light materials. The chapel was located near River at Lumang Bayan and transferred to present site. It is clearly evident why the said Barrio named Lumang Bayan means-Old Poblacion. From 1590 to 1602, Quingua was administered by Friar Curate from Malolos Church which close at hand.

The present church was built in 1602 and established as the town church of the newly created Pueblo de Quingua.

Plaridel is one of the earliest settlement to be established at around 1590 as Encomienda. Its Parish Church of Santiago Apostol has one of the unique Moorish architectural style among the Augustinian Churches in the province. It was here that the money and jewels of san Agustin in Intramuros, Manila were kept during British Occupation in 1762–63.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The church is small and its two level facade is bare. However, the crowning pediment is elaborate consisting of a pair of volutes with the inner space filled with triangular patterns and floral embellishments that first glance can be mistaken as having a Moorish influence because of the minaret like dome formed. In between the volutes are a series of spaced relieves of cherubs, ramilletes, two saints including that of St. Augustine and the pierced heart which is the symbol of the Augustinian Order. The octagonal and tapering belltower on the other hand sits on a quadrilateral base and rises 4 levels.[http://simbahan.net/2008/03/10/visita-iglesia-the-old-churches-of-bulacan-part-1-of-2/ Visita Iglesia: The old churches of Bulacan, Part 1 of 2]

The Parish Church of Santiago Apostol is the location of [[GMA Network]]'s ''Fantaserye Darna'' (2009), ''Zaido'' (2007), ''Iglot'' (2011) and afternoon drama series, ''Nita Negrita'' (2011), ''Broken Vow'' (2012). And the Judy Ann Santos-Sarah Geronimo Movie ''Hating Kapatid'' in July 2010.

And recently, [[ABS-CBN]]'s drama anthology ''Maalaala mo kaya: Toga'', starring Albie Casiño and Erich Gonzales and the episode of Police Uniform" starring Empress and Joseph Marco.

===Salubong Festival or Horse Festival===
[[File:Santiago Apostol de Quingua (29 December 2021 night procession).jpg|thumb|[[James the Great|Santiago Apostol]], the patron saint of Plaridel, Bulacan]]
