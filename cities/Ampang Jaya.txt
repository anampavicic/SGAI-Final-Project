'''Ampang Jaya''', more commonly known as just '''Ampang''', is a town, a [[mukim]] and a [[Ampang (federal constituency)|parliamentary constituency]] straddling parts of the [[Hulu Langat District]] and [[Gombak District]], in eastern [[Selangor]], [[Malaysia]]. It is located just outside the eastern border of [[Kuala Lumpur]] Federal Territory.

It is administered by the Ampang Jaya Municipal Council (MPAJ), which is the formal name of the township as well.

==History==
Kuala Lumpur was founded in 1857 at the confluence of the Sungei Lumpur (now [[Gombak River]]) and the [[Klang River]], which now houses the [[Jamek Mosque|Kuala Lumpur Jamek Mosque]]. Before the arrival of the Chinese for [[tin mining]], Kuala Lumpur was a small hamlet with only several shops and houses.<ref name="gullick"/> [[Klang War|Raja Abdullah]], who is also the representative of the Sultan in Klang, and Raja Juma'at of [[Lukut]] sent 87 Chinese miners from Lukut in 1857 to open tin mines in Ampang, thus beginning the development of Kuala Lumpur.<ref name="gullick 1955">{{cite journal|url=http://myrepositori.pnm.gov.my/bitstream/123456789/2265/1/JB1865_MBRA.pdf |title=Kuala Lumpur 1880–1895 |journal=Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=10–11 |author=J.M.

The name "Ampang" derives from the old spelling of the Malay word ''empangan'' (or ''ampangan''), meaning ''dam''; the place was named in reference to the miners' dams.<ref name="gullick">{{cite book |title=The story of Kuala Lumpur, 1857–1939 |author= J.M.

Between colonial rule and February 1974, Ampang district was part of the greater Kuala Lumpur district in Selangor. Following the creation of the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur on 1 February 1974, Ampang district was split into two; the western part, located within the Federal Territory, became [[Ampang, Kuala Lumpur|Ampang Hilir]],<ref>{{cite web |title=JPS WPKL - Profil Daerah |url=http://apps.water.gov.my/jpskomuniti/dokumen/jpswpkl@komuniti-zon%20selatan3.pdf |access-date=22 January 2020 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and the eastern part, remained in Selangor, as part of [[Hulu Langat District|Hulu Langat (Kajang) District]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Map of British Malaya, including the Straits Settlements, Federated Malay States and Malay States not included in the Federation, 1924 |url=https://storage.googleapis.com/raremaps/img/xlarge/43586.jpg |website=Raremaps.com |access-date=22 January 2020}}</ref>

During the height of the [[Malayan Emergency]] in the 1950s, the British established the Ampang [[New Village]], which became one of the largest Chinese settlements in the [[Klang Valley]]. The Kau Ong Yah Lam Thian Kiong Temple (安邦南天宮) in Ampang New Village is famous for the [[Nine Emperor Gods Festival|Nine Emperor Gods]] festival, which is celebrated annually on the 9th month of the Chinese lunar calendar, between late-September and early-October.

On 1 July 1992, the [[Selayang Municipal Council|Gombak District Council]] (''Majlis Daerah Gombak'') and the [[Kajang Municipal Council|Hulu Langat District Council]] (''Majlis Daerah Hulu Langat'') respectively ceded the districts of [[Ulu Klang]] and Ampang, forming the Ampang Jaya Municipal Council.

The Ampang Jaya municipality however also covers the [[Pandan (federal constituency)|Pandan]] parliamentary constituency and the [[Hulu Kelang (state constituency)|Hulu Klang]] state constituency within the [[Gombak (federal constituency)|Gombak]] parliamentary constituency.

==Transportation==
===Car===
Effectively a suburb of Kuala Lumpur, Ampang is well connected to other places by a series of federal highways, tolled highways and state routes. [[Jalan Ampang]] {{JKR(B)|31}} is the main thoroughfare from downtown Kuala Lumpur until Taman Rimba Ampang. The [[Ampang–Kuala Lumpur Elevated Highway|AKLEH]] diverted some of the traffic from Jalan Ampang. The [[Kuala Lumpur Middle Ring Road 2|MRR2]] [[Malaysia Federal Route 28|Federal Route 28]] runs through Ampang in a north–south orientation - this road is now the main route taken by Ampang motorists to get to either [[Pahang]] due north or [[Negeri Sembilan]] due south. The [[Besraya Expressway]] extension begins in Kampung Ampang Campuran, goes through [[Pandan Indah]] and all the way to [[Seri Kembangan]].

Besides that, there is a [[Jalan Ampang–Hulu Langat|state-level hill road to Hulu Langat]] {{JKR(B)|62}} which serves as a shortcut to [[Kajang]].

===Public transportation===
{{RapidKL Rail code|AG|18}} {{lrts|Ampang}} is the namesake and terminus of the [[Ampang Line]], which is Malaysia's first LRT/metro system. The station, renovated in 2012, is located along Jalan Ampang. The stretch between Ampang and {{lrts|Plaza Rakyat}} used to be part of [[KTM Intercity]] until the 1990s. KTM presently does not serve Ampang or its surroundings.

Other than the aforementioned Ampang station, the Ampang Jaya municipal district is also served by the {{KLRT color code|AG|17}} [[Cahaya LRT station|Cahaya]], {{KLRT color code|AG|16}} [[Cempaka LRT station|Cempaka]], {{KLRT color code|AG|15}} [[Pandan Indah LRT station|Pandan Indah]] and {{KLRT color code|AG|14}} [[Pandan Jaya LRT station|Pandan Jaya]] stations, all on the Ampang Line.

The Cempaka-Pandan Jaya stretch is however not in Ampang proper, but located in the adjacent constituency of [[Pandan (federal constituency)|Pandan]] instead.

According to unofficial proposals, a [[MRT Circle Line]], surrounding downtown Kuala Lumpur would be built. Ampang station was reportedly one of the possible stops, along [[Abdullah Hukum LRT station|Abdullah Hukum]], [[Bandar Malaysia]], [[Segambut Komuter station|Segambut]], [[Sentul Timur LRT station|Sentul Timur]], [[Jelatek LRT station|Jelatek]] and [[Taman Midah MRT station|Taman Midah]].

Besides the LRT, bus and taxi options are available. For example, [[rapidKL]] bus route 300 leads from the Ampang LRT station to [[Kuala Lumpur City Centre|KLCC]].
