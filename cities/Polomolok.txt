'''Polomolok''', officially the '''Municipality of Polomolok''' ({{langx|hil|Banwa sang Polomolok}}; {{langx|ceb|Lungsod sa Polomolok}}; {{langx|tl|Bayan ng Polomolok}}; {{langx|mdh|Inged nu Pulumuluk}}, [[Jawi Alphabet|Jawi]]: ايڠد نو ڤولومولوک), is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[South Cotabato]], [[Philippines]]. As of May 2020, it has a population of 172,605 people making it the most populated municipality in Mindanao.{{PH census|current}}

It is located between [[General Santos]] and [[Tupi, South Cotabato|Tupi]]. Polomolok is seated about {{Convert|41|km}} south-east of the provincial capital city of [[Koronadal]], {{Convert|17|km}} north of the port city of [[General Santos]] and {{Convert|1030|km}} south-east of the national capital [[Manila]]. As of 2019, it is the second wealthiest Municipality in Mindanao with [[Philippine peso|PHP]] 1.77 Billion worth of assets and in 2021, Polomolok is the 2nd Most Competitive Municipality in Mindanao (9th Nationwide).<ref name="CMCI">{{cite web|title=Most Competitive Municipality in Mindanao|publisher=Cities and Municipalities Competitive Index|url=https://cmci.dti.gov.ph/lgu-profile.php?lgu=Polomolok/}}</ref> Polomolok also serves as the chief town in the 1st District of South Cotabato.

On March 2, 2020, former South Cotabato First District Representative Shirlyn Bañas-Nograles filed House Bill No. 6432 for the conversion of the Municipality of Polomolok into a component city of South Cotabato.<ref name="https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/bills/house-bill-no-6432-18th-congress-republic">{{cite web|title=House Bill No. 6432, 18th Congress of the Republic AN ACT CONVERTING THE MUNICIPALITY OF POLOMOLOK IN THE PROVINCE OF SOUTH COTABATO INTO A COMPONENT CITY TO BE KNOWN AS THE CITY OF POLOMOLOK|publisher=Senate of the Philippines Legislative Digital Resources|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/bills/house-bill-no-6432-18th-congress-republic|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>

==History==
The name Polomolok was derived from the Blaan term ''flomlok'', which means hunting ground. In the early years, the place where the Poblacion is presently situated was known for its abundance of wild life. There were no roads and the lowlanders befriended the Blaan highlanders and utilized them as guides. Aside from a rich hunting ground, Polomolok had so many creeks with free flowing water coming from the hillsides. Those cold and clear flowing water encouraged foreigners to settle in this place. One of them was a Japanese trader Zenjiro Takahashi and his Blaan wife. He began clearing the area and planted agricultural crops. Not long after, some of the Christians came to settle and started to clear the area.

In 1940, the Philippines Commonwealth government embarked on a very bold program of social amelioration. One of the projects was the distribution of lands to interested people who wanted to settle in Mindanao. Settlers were brought by boat to Dadiangas (General Santos) from Luzon and Visayas. On November 2, 1940, Polomolok was officially opened for settlement and known as Polomok Settlement District. Atty. Ernesto Jimenez was appointed as its first overseer. He was responsible for the allocation of farm lots.  Then came the creation of some barrios of the settlers. These were Palkan, Lemblisong, Polo, Polomolok Central (now Poblacion), Polomolok Creek (now Magsaysay), Sulit, Lamcaliaf, Kinilis, Glamang, Bentung, Koronadal Proper, Leve, and Silway. The first settlers, after a crop or two, started to invite their friends and relatives to settle in this place, because the soil was so fertile that any crop can survive due to favorable climate conditions.

The settlement program was interrupted for four years by the Second World War. Don Francisco Natividad was appointed Military Mayor with Datu Badung Nilong as Vice Mayor and Sgt. Nuevarez as Chief of Police. In 1948, Perfecto Balili was designated NLSA Administrator with Rosendo Sarte as Officer-In-Charge. In 1954, the NLSA was abolished in the course of government reorganization. All records of NLSA were taken over by the Board of Liquidators. The Municipality of General Santos (formerly Buayan) was incorporated.

On August 21, 1957, the Municipality of Polomolok was created by virtue of a Presidential Executive Order No. 264 signed by President [[Carlos P. Garcia]]. It started functioning as a regular and independent municipality on September 10, 1957, as a 6th class municipality. The local officials were appointed by the President. Its first appointed Mayor was Datu Badong Nilong.

From 1957 to 1963, the progress of this town was still very slow. Fields have always been green, harvest bountiful but farm products had low market value and circulation of cash was rather slow. Then came a breakthrough, when the largest pineapple company, the [[Dole Food Company|Dole Philippines Inc.]], was planted and inaugurated on December 7, 1963.

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
House Bill No. 6432 was filed by former South Cotabato First District Representative Shirlyn Bañas-Nograles on March 2, 2020 for the conversion of the municipality of Polomolok into a component city in the province of South Cotabato.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Nograles|first=Shirlyn|title=AN ACT CONVERTING THE MUNICIPALITY OF POLOMOLOK IN THE PROVINCE OF SOUTH COTABATO INTO A COMPONENT CITY TO BE KNOWN AS THE CITY OF POLOMOLOK|url=https://congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/basic_18/HB06432.pdf|url-status=live|access-date=April 20, 2021|website=House of Representatives|archive-date=April 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210420085235/https://congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/basic_18/HB06432.pdf}}</ref> However, the Bureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF)’s Average Annual Income (AAI) Certification No. 2021-008 indicates that Polomolok still fell short of the required income thus stalling the proposed conversion. A municipality needs P100M as its Annual Average Income (AAI) to qualify for the conversion into a city. Polomolok's AAI was only P76.9 for FY 2018 and 2019. The bill is currently pending with the committee on local government since March 4, 2020.

== Geography ==
Located at the southern part of South Cotabato, Polomolok is nestled at the base of the prominent [[Mount Matutum]]. It is cone-shaped volcano and looms over the provinces at {{Convert|2286|m}} high, a unique challenge to mountaineers. It is perhaps the provinces most imposing landmark.

Natural hot and cold spring abound at its foot. Natural springs are abundant within this area and provide free flowing water. Two of these springs have developed into natural resorts.

===Barangays===
Polomolok is politically subdivided into 23 [[barangay]]s. Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s  while some have [[sitios]].

Barangay [[Poblacion]] is also known as Polomolok itself. There are 4 urban barangays and 19 rural barangays.

Plantations of this crop are in Barangay Sulit, Sumbakil, Crossing Palkan, Bentung, Lapu, Pagalungan, Lumakil, Rubber and Magsaysay.

Vegetables grow well in Barangay Palkan, Kinilis, Maligo, Sumbakil and Koronadal Proper where the climate is cool and the soil is fertile. However, the farmers cannot really produce in large volume due to financial constraints and unstable prevailing market prices of vegetables.

Livestock and poultry production has increased tremendously in the past years. This is partly due to the municipality's climate and terrain which is ideal for livestock and poultry production. The land area devoted for agri-livestock production is 80 hectares or 0.27 percent of the total agricultural land.

For the year 2006, the Office of the Municipal Agriculturist reported that there are 322,628 heads of livestocks and poultry raised in the municipality.
