'''Rancagua''' ({{IPA|es|raŋˈkaɣwa}}) is a [[List of cities in Chile|city]] and [[Communes of Chile|commune]] in central [[Chile]] and part of the [[Rancagua conurbation]]. It is the capital of the [[Cachapoal Province]] and of the [[O'Higgins Region]], located {{convert|87|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the [[national capital]] of [[Santiago]].

It was originally named '''Santa Cruz de Triana''' by Spanish colonists. In 2012, its population was 232,211.<ref name= "INE"/> The main economic activities range from [[mining]], [[tourism]], [[agriculture]], [[timber]], [[food production]] and services to minor industrial activities. The city also serves as the administrative and legal center of the region.

Together with [[Machalí]] and Gultro, it forms the [[Rancagua conurbation]]. After [[Curicó]], [[Talca]] and [[Greater Concepción|Concepción]], it is one of the most important and densely populated cities of the south central zone of Chile.

==History==
===Foundation period===
[[File:Carga de O'Higgins.jpg|200px|thumbnail|left|The [[Battle of Rancagua]] during the [[Chilean War of Independence]], by [[Pedro Subercaseaux]].]]
The Rancagua Valley was occupied by the local [[Picunche]]. They fell briefly under the control of the [[Inca Empire]] in the 15th century. Its remains in structures can still be found near the city today.<ref>{{cite book|last=Miranda Salas|first=Felix|title=Historia de Rancagua|url=http://www.biblioteca.org.ar/libros/154846.pdf}}</ref> Through their civil engineering, the Inca accomplished expeditions to the south of their empire.

Rancagua was founded by Spanish explorer [[José Antonio Manso de Velasco]], who founded several cities in the central area of Chile. The settlement was first called Villa Santa Cruz de Triana.

The city is notable in [[History of Chile|Chilean history]] as the scene of the [[Disaster of Rancagua]] of 1814, when Chilean forces fighting for independence from Spain were defeated. This marked the beginning of the period known as the ''Reconquista'' (Reconquest), an attempt by Spain to regain control of Chile.

===Today===
[[File:Estación Rancagua 2012.jpg|250px|thumbnail|left|Rancagua train station.]]
In recent years the city has become one of the most attractive cultural and tourist centers in the [[O'Higgins Region of Chile|O'Higgins Region]], largely because of the vineyards that have been developed in the area. Rancagua also offers sports centers and easy access to smaller villages and towns.

Other visitors are attracted to the archeological sites, such as [[Pukara de La Compañia]] and the nearby [[Río Los Cipreses National Reserve|Rio Cipreses nature reserve]]. Both can be visited by private vehicle or with local tour companies.

The city is connected to the capital, [[Santiago]], by the [[Pan-American Highway|Panamerican Highway]] ([[Chile Route 5]]). In addition, the [[Metrotren]] connects the [[Santiago Metro|metro service]] in Santiago to Rancagua by train.

Rancagua is home of the [[:es:Universidad de Rancagua | University of Rancagua]] (in Spanish), the first private university to be established in the [[O'Higgins Region of Chile|O'Higgins Region]].

The region is known for ''[[El Teniente]]'' in the nearby [[Andes|Andes mountain range]]: it is the "largest underground copper mine in the world."<ref>{{cite web|title=Copper Mining in Chile|url=http://copperinvestingnews.com/4878-copper-mining-in-chile-part-i.html|publisher=Copper Investment News|access-date=30 October 2012}}</ref> It is located about {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=on}} to the east of the city. El Teniente is a division of the state-owned mining enterprise, [[Codelco]].

The city's Braden Copper Stadium, named for the American company that developed the mine through the first half of the 20th century, was one of the four venues of the [[1962 FIFA World Cup]]. More recently, it houses the [[O'Higgins F.C.|O'Higgins]] professional football (soccer) club, one of the leading teams in Chilean professional football.<!-- Use their term for the sport -->  Every year, the [[Campeonato Nacional de Rodeo|National Championship]] of [[Chilean rodeo]] is held in the [[Medialuna Monumental de Rancagua]]. In 2015, the city hosted the [[2015 Copa América]], receiving two matches of the tournament.

==Demographics==
[[File:Vía Crucis en Rancagua.jpg|200px|thumbnail|People of Rancagua in the [[Stations of the Cross]] ceremony.]]
The population of Rancagua is primarily either of Spanish descent or [[mestizo]], with a particularly strong Basque influence. There are also residents of German, Croatian, Italian, Greek, Levantine Arab, Swiss, French, English or Irish ancestry living in the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Chile & Its People|url=http://www.ohigginstours.com/information|publisher=O'Higgins Tours}}</ref> Indigenous Mapuche workers migrate from the south<ref name=INE /> and there are also some [[Romani people|Roma gypsies]].

In addition, there has been increasing immigration to the city from neighbouring South American countries such as [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]] and [[Peru]].<ref name=INE /> According to the 2002 census of the [[National Statistics Institute (Chile)|National Statistics Institute]], Rancagua spans an area of {{convert|260.3|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} and has 214,344 inhabitants (104,879 men and 109,465 women). Of these, 206,971 (96.6%) lived in urban areas and 7,373 (3.4%) in rural areas. The population grew by 14.4% (27,020 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses.<ref name= "INE"/>

<!-- Within the [[electoral divisions of Chile]], Rancagua is represented in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]] by Alejandro García-Huidobro ([[Independent Democratic Union|UDI]]) and Juan Luis Castro ([[Socialist Party of Chile|PS]]) as part of the 32nd electoral district, which consists entirely of the Rancagua commune. The commune is represented in the [[Senate of Chile|Senate]] by [[Andrés Chadwick|Andrés Chadwick Piñera]] (UDI) and Juan Pablo Letelier Morel (PS) as part of the 9th senatorial constituency (O'Higgins Region). -->

==Culture==

This area is known as the "huaso province" after the name of the Chilean cowboy, the ''[[huaso]].'' The population is a mixture of both [[Europe]]an (including [[Argentine]] immigrants) and [[Indigenous peoples in Chile|indigenous]] races and cultures. The region has a homogeneous culture known as ''Chileanidad'' and a [[mestizo]] influence is evident.

Rancagua and the Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins Region was settled by Spaniards (notably [[Andalusian people|Andalusian]], [[Basque people|Basque]], [[Aragon]]ese and [[Navarre]]se) and other Europeans. [[French Chilean|French]] and [[Italian Chilean|Italian]] families established agriculture, including the important [[Chilean wine|wine]] industry: [[wine|the Wine Route]] is one of the main tourist attractions of the [[Colchagua Valley|Colchagua valley]]. Breweries can be found as well, the legacy of [[German Chilean|German]] and [[Swiss Chilean|Swiss]] immigration. Livestock development and herding was especially influenced by [[British Chilean|British]], [[Greek Chilean|Greek]] and [[Yugoslavia]]n settlers.

Because the city is relatively close to Santiago, there has led to a growing urban influence in the local culture. Rancagua is fast becoming a suburb of Santiago's upper-class professional workforce.

== Mining - El Teniente ==
Situated 44 km east of Rancagua and 75 km south of the capital, Santiago, [[El Teniente]] claims to be the largest underground copper mine in the world (see below). The El Teniente orebody has been known and worked on a small scale for many years. In the 16th century it became the property of the Jesuits as it was located on their Hacienda de la Compañia de Jesús. They operated a small mine known as the Socavón de los Jesuitas. Following their expulsion, the hacienda was acquired in 1768 by Don Mateo de Toro y Zambrano y Ureta. Between 1819 and 1823 his heirs restarted and enlarged the workings, bringing in a mining engineer to help. However, these and subsequent attempts to establish anything more than a small scale mine failed for lack of capital and the property was eventually bought by the American, William Braden, for approximately US$100,000. The same year Braden formed Rancagua Mines, which became the Braden Copper Company, in association with old colleagues from ASARCO, including Barton Sewell.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Przeworski |first=Joanne Fox |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xn5jSP46ZNQC&dq=chile+copper+history&pg=PA258 |title=The Decline of the Copper Industry in Chile and the Entrance of North American Capital, 1870-1916 |date=1980-01-01 |publisher=Arno Press |isbn=978-0-405-13379-4 |language=en}}</ref>

Work started on establishing a mine in 1905 after Government permission had been acquired but progress was slow because of difficulty of access and a hard winter climate. A small gravity plant was soon erected but it was not until 1912 that a flotation plant was erected at Sewell. Control passed to Kennecott in 1915 and it ran the mine until [[nationalization]] in 1971.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=1973-10-22 |title=NATIONALIZATION: Return to El Teniente? |language=en-US |magazine=Time |url=https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,908062,00.html |access-date=2022-11-04 |issn=0040-781X}}</ref>

==Climate==
Rancagua has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csb''), with clearly marked seasons. Summers are generally extremely dry, with cool mornings and hot afternoons, while winters are mild with cold mornings and occasional periods of heavy rainfall that averages around {{convert|510|mm|in|2|disp=or}} each year – almost all of which occurs during a handful of storms between May and August. In some years there can be a little snow.
