'''Gunsan''' ({{Korean|hangul=군산}}; {{IPA|ko|kun.sʰan}}), also romanized as '''Kunsan''', is a [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|city]] in [[North Jeolla Province|Jeonbuk State]], [[South Korea]]. It is on the south bank of the [[Geum River]] just upstream from its exit into the [[Yellow Sea]]. It has emerged as a high-tech manufacturing industrial city and an international trade seaport that is approximately {{convert|200|km|abbr=on}} southwest of Seoul on the midwest coast of the Korean Peninsula.

[[Kunsan Air Base]] operated by the [[United States Air Force]] is in the city. To encourage investment, a free trade zone has been declared. 


Dialect: Jeolla dialect

==History==
[[File:Kunsan air base with F-16s.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Kunsan Air Base]]]]

Gunsan was a small fishing village on the banks of the Geum River, near where the river spills into the Yellow Sea. It sits on the fertile western ''Honam'' plain where much rice is harvested. Gunsan became a port in the late 19th century largely due to pressure from the Japanese on the Koreans to ship rice to Japan. In 1899, Gunsan Port officially opened up to international trade. Gunsan City was largely settled by Japanese during the period of the Japanese occupation, and was known as Gunzan. The old (now demolished) City Hall and the Customs House are of Japanese construction. After liberation from the Japanese in 1945, Gunsan began to grow slowly.
[[File:Emblem of Gunsan-bu.svg|thumb|Emblem of Gunzanfu(gunsan bu), the administrative division gunsan fell under Japanese rule.]]
The [[Korean War]] of the 1950s left the Gunsan area relatively unscathed. The initial drive south by the Communist North Koreans pushed the [[United Nations]] and South Korean forces toward [[Busan]] so quickly that Gunsan was spared from protracted fighting.

Nevertheless, a battalion of [[Republic of Korea Marine Corps|Korean Marines]], entrenched in the hills above Gunsan Port, withheld overwhelming communist forces. Their bravery created extra time for the evacuation of the town and port. The action is commemorated with a monument on the ridgeline where the heaviest fighting occurred. ({{coord|35|59|26|N|126|42|16|E|scale:10000_type:landmark_region:KR-45|name=(monument)}})

The drive north by the United Nations forces occurred so rapidly that there was little direct confrontation in the area. After the cessation of hostilities, the [[United States Air Force]] occupied nearby Kunsan Air Base, which has affected Gunsan City.

[[Kunsan Air Base]] was originally constructed, under Japanese direction, by reclaiming mudflats starting in around 1923. Kunsan Air Base has hosted a variety of USAF combat aircraft. The proximity of US service members to Gunsan City has provided some economic growth to Gunsan City, but the base's influence has waned since the 1990s as a result of a more powerful and diversified Korean economy. The downtown shopping districts that catered to US troops have transformed into areas that are indistinguishable from surrounding areas that serve Korean shoppers. Only a few remaining stores hint at the area's previous manifestation as an American shopping district. The small Okku-Silver Town (or more popularly America Town) caters to US troops. About {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} from the main gate of Kunsan Air Base, America Town hosts bars, dance clubs, restaurants, and souvenir shops.

==Economy==
Today, Gunsan's economy thrives on fishing, agriculture and heavy industry west of the city in the reclaimed area known as the Industrial Zone. [[GM Korea]] operated a factory here that assembled the [[Chevrolet Aveo]] worldwide and as the [[Holden Barina]] in Australia and New Zealand until 2018. Near the port, the [[Tata Daewoo Commercial Vehicle]] factory produces Daewoo trucks for the domestic and export markets. In the domestic market vehicles are sold under Daewoo brand; the [[Tata Group|Tata]] brand name is used for export due to the dilution of the [[Daewoo]] brand.

It is a major port, especially for rice shipments, and is a commercial center for the rice grown in the Geum basin. Rice processing and shipbuilding are important industries, and paper, lumber, rubber, and plastic are also produced. Originally a poor fishing village, Gunsan gained importance with the development of its port, which was opened to foreign trade in 1899. The Japanese, who ruled Korea from 1905 to 1945, further developed the city and port.

Just south of Gunsan is the newly opened [[Saemangum Seawall]], the longest [[Dyke (construction)|dyke]] in the world. {{Citation needed|date=November 2024}}

===Tourist attractions===

The [[Gunsan Islands]] consist of 16 inhabited islands and 47 uninhabited islands. Gogunsangundo Islands constitutes Shinsido Island, Munyeodo Island, Bangchukdo Island, and Maldo Island, and Seonyudo Island is the center of the islands. A passenger ship to Seonyudo Island operates on average 6-8 times a day.

''Eunpa,'' meaning "Silver Wave" (because of its feature of shining water under sunshine), was originally a reservoir for agriculture but designated as a National Tourist Place in 1985. In spring, a 1-km cherry blossom tunnel is formed from the entrance to the facility compound. In summer, people can enjoy wind surfing and boating in the acacia fragrance. In fall, people can enjoy walking along a promenade stretching from the meeting square at the entrance while picking up chestnuts. It is not only known as a local representation of Gunsan, but also as the nation's tourist place with a mixture of Mulbit (Water and Light) Bridge 370 m long and 3 m wide. A music fountain operates 8 times, 20 minutes per round. It was selected as one of the 100 Big Noted Tourists in Korea in the 'Creating a Good Place to Live' local resources contest.

In 1990, a river mouth bank was constructed at the mouth of Geum Rivers, which was the gateway of [[Baekje]]. It is spotlighted as the largest migrant bird colony in Korea with reed forests. It has become nationally famous because of the grand sight of many uncommon migratory birds such as Baikal teals, wild ducks, mallards, wild geese, herring gulls, black head gulls, black head Kentish plovers, etc., and approximately 500,000 winter migrant birds of 40 types visit between mid-October and March. A 360-degree observatory offers detailed and close-up views of migrant birds of the Geumgang River area, and the Bird Watching Gallery is the best vantage point in all of Korea to view migratory birds.

[[Wolmyeong Dong Park|Wolmyeong Park]] is in the middle of Gunsan city. During spring, colorful cherry blossoms and camellia flowers are in full bloom, while the foliage attracts visitors during fall.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} On the mountain top, both Geumgang (river) and West sea are visible.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Japanese style houses in Sinheung-Dong are traditional houses of Japanese style, which was constructed by Hiroth, a Japanese fabric dealer of large scale during the colonial era. It has a great architectural value{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} as the roof, finishing touch of outer wall, and inner garden are kept as they were when it was first constructed. It is also a place of filming the movies, such as ''The Son of the General'' and ''Ttajja''.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Dongguksa is the only temple left in Korea which was built in Japanese style. Plain eaves and many windows of the outer wall of the main temple are the characteristics of Japanese temples.

Jinpo Marine Park is a theme park that displays retired military equipment (13 types, 16 equipment) of the armed forces, such as Korean naval vessels, at the inner harbor of the historical site of Jinpo battle, recorded to be the first naval battle with guns of warships in the world.

Saemanguem New Year's Festival is hosted on the first day (January 1) of every year at Saemangeum seawall, the longest seawall in the world. Through events, such as sharing rice cake soup, writing new wishes, and releasing balloons of hopes, this day provides an opportunity to plan the new year with family, make wishes, and feel the mystique and deep sensation of nature.
