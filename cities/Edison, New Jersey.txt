What is now Edison Township was originally incorporated as '''Raritan Township''' by an act of the [[New Jersey Legislature]] on March 17, 1870, from portions of both [[Piscataway, New Jersey|Piscataway]] and [[Woodbridge Township, New Jersey|Woodbridge Township]]. The township got its original name from the [[Raritan people|Raritan indigenous people]]. Portions of the township were taken to form [[Metuchen, New Jersey|Metuchen]] on March 20, 1900, and [[Highland Park, New Jersey|Highland Park]] on March 15, 1905. The name was officially changed to Edison Township on November 10, 1954, in honor of inventor [[Thomas Edison]], who had [[Thomas Edison#Menlo Park|his main laboratory]] in the [[Menlo Park, New Jersey|Menlo Park]] section of the township.<ref name=Story>Snyder, John P.

Stelton Baptist Church was formed in the spring of 1689, and among its original members was the Stelle family, after whom the Stelton section of Edison is named. Through 1875, however, the church was known as the First Baptist Church of Piscataway. Present-day congregants celebrated the tercentennial of their church in a year-long celebration in 1989. The land now occupied by the church and burial ground at Stelton was purchased in April 1731, and a house of worship erected there in 1748. This building was taken down and rebuilt in 1825, but was destroyed by fire January 1, 1851. The building which took its place, also burned in 1924, and the present church was erected in 1925. In 1870 the incorporation of parts of Piscataway and Woodbridge Townships to form Raritan Township, placed the church in the latter municipality, which became Edison. |publisher=Edison, New Jersey |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070823115555/http://www.edisonnj.org/historic/plaques/histplaq2.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2007-08-23}}</ref>]]
The earliest residents of the area were the [[Raritan people]] of the [[Lenape]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who lived in the area and travelled through it to the shore.

In 1646 the tribe consisted of 1200 warriors and twenty chiefs, among whom tradition has it was Matouchin, chief of the Indians in this section."</ref>

Edison Township, which was formed from sections of Piscataway and Woodbridge townships, was settled (by Europeans) in the 17th century.

In 1876, [[Thomas Edison]] set up his home and research laboratory in New Jersey on the site of an unsuccessful real estate development in Raritan Township called "[[Menlo Park, New Jersey|Menlo Park]]", (currently located in [[Edison State Park]]). While there he earned the nickname "the Wizard of Menlo Park". Before his death at age 83 in 1931, the prolific inventor amassed a record 1,093 patents for creations including the [[phonograph]], a stock ticker, the motion-picture camera, the [[incandescent light bulb]], a mechanical vote counter, the alkaline storage battery including one for an electric car, and the first commercial electric light.<ref name=Walsh>Walsh, Bryan.

===Telecommunications===
Edison is served by [[area codes 732 and 848]] and [[area code 908|908]]. Area Code 848 is an overlay area code that was created so that a split was not needed.

Edison has five Verizon Central offices serving the Township:

* Central Office Rahway (Switch ID: RHWYNJRADS5) (Area Code 732): Serving from Wood Avenue North to Roxy Avenue on the west side of the Street inward to New Dover Road.
* Central Office Plainfield (Switch ID: PLFDNJPFDS5) (Area Code 908): Serving Roxy Avenue heading north into South Plainfield on both sides of Inman Avenue.
* Central Office Metuchen (Switch ID: MTCHNJMTDS5) (Area Code 732): Serving Edison, Metuchen and Iselin (Technically Iselin Numbers that have 732–283 and 732–404 are routed out of the Woodbridge Office Switch ID: WDBRNJWDDS5).
* Central Office Edison (Switch ID: EDSNNJEDDS5): Serving South Edison with phone numbers that come up as "New Brunswick" – 732–339, 732–393, 732–572, 732–777, 732–819, 732–985, and Exchanges for "Metuchen" that are 732–248, 732–287, 732–650.
* Central Office Fords (Switch ID: FRDSNJFRDS5): Serving Eastern Edison area and Raritan Center areas with 732–225, 732–346, 732–417, 732–512 and Perth Amboy Exchanges 732–661, 732–738.

In 1982, the BPU and New Jersey Bell, after receiving thousands of complaints from both North and South Edison residents, made an exception that any calls originating and terminating in the Township would be considered a local call. This was due to the new home construction in Edison where existing cables that belonged to the Rahway central office were assigned to give new phone service to over 400 homes.

In 1997, mandatory [[ten-digit dialing]] came to Edison with the introduction of [[Area codes 732 and 848|Area code 732]]. Edison residents living on Roxy Avenue once again were in the spotlight in the news, with one side of the street served by the Rahway central office (Area code 732) and the other side of the street is served by the Plainfield central office (Area Code 908). Residents complained to the BPU and Bell Atlantic that it would be easier to yell across the street than dial a ten-digit number to call their neighbor across the street.

Edison has Cablevision's Optimum cable television service. Before Cablevision, there was TKR, which was so poorly run that many FCC and BPU complaints about programming and many town hall meetings eventually forced change. TKR was bought out by Cablevision.
