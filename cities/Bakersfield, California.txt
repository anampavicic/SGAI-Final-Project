[[File:Francisco Garcés.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Spanish priest [[Francisco Garcés]] arrived in the Bakersfield area in 1776.]]
In 1776, Spanish missionary [[Francisco Garcés]] became the first European to explore the area. Recording his May 1 arrival to a Yokuts village along the Kern River, immediately northeast of present Bakersfield, Garcés wrote,<ref name=":3" />

Given the remoteness and inaccessibility of the region, the Yokuts remained largely isolated from further contact until after the [[Mexican War of Independence]], when Mexican settlers began to migrate to the area. Following the discovery of [[California Gold Rush|gold in California]] in 1848, settlers flooded into the [[San Joaquin Valley]]. In 1851, gold was discovered along the [[Kern River]] in the southern [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and in 1865, oil was discovered in the valley.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oceanpark.ws/1860-1870test.htm |title=History on gold & oil |work=oceanpark.ws |date=2009 |access-date=November 24, 2009 |archive-date=January 2, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102101532/http://oceanpark.ws/1860-1870test.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> The Bakersfield area, once a [[tule]] reed-covered marshland, was first known as Kern Island to the handful of [[settler|pioneers]], who built log cabins there in 1860.

=== Establishment of rail connection ===
[[File:California - Bakersfield - NARA - 23934085 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of Bakersfield in 1925]]
In 1874, the [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific Railroad]] first arrived in Kern County. However, the train depot was placed nearly three miles east of Bakersfield due to a land dispute between the railroad and the town.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book |last=Bergman |first=John |title=The Southern San Joaquin Valley: A Railroad History. |publisher=Jostens Printing and Publishing Company |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-615-25105-9 |pages=139–140}}</ref>

Desperate to get their own station, Bakersfield residents, sugar magnate Clause Spreckels, and small investors from all over the state ended up raising around $3,500,000 by January 17, 1895, to fund a second railroad to Bakersfield. By January 29, 1895, the [[San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Railroad]] was born. Dubbed the "People's Railroad," the project was completed and warmly welcomed by the town with a parade attended by thousands on May 27, 1898, amidst the Spanish-American War and over 20 years after the completion of Southern Pacific's line. Competition from the new railroad caused Southern Pacific to lower its fares from $9.10 ($347.22 in 2023) to $6.90 ($263.27 in 2023) to match the new railroad's fare.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hooper |first=Ken |date=December 26, 2014 |title=History: Bakersfield freed from railroad tyranny |url=https://www.bakersfield.com/bakersfield_life/history-bakersfield-freed-from-railroad-tyranny/article_dc1bc867-d6d8-53c1-9e11-984b83d8b897.html |access-date=December 24, 2023 |website=The Bakersfield Californian |language=en |archive-date=December 24, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231224072045/https://www.bakersfield.com/bakersfield_life/history-bakersfield-freed-from-railroad-tyranny/article_dc1bc867-d6d8-53c1-9e11-984b83d8b897.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Eventually, a [[Bakersfield and Kern Electric Railway|streetcar line]] would connect the Santa Fe station to the Southern Pacific station in Sumner (now [[East Bakersfield]]).<ref name=":4" />

However, while the track had reached Bakersfield in 1898, a station would not be constructed until 1899 due to the San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Railroad being purchased by [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe]]. The new station was located at the intersection of 15th Street and F Street and was demolished in 1972.<ref>{{Cite web |title=PCAD - Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF), Depot, Bakersfield, CA |url=https://pcad.lib.washington.edu/building/17148/ |access-date=December 24, 2023 |website=pcad.lib.washington.edu |archive-date=December 24, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231224072042/https://pcad.lib.washington.edu/building/17148/ |url-status=live }}</ref> It was replaced with the present day [[Bakersfield station (Amtrak)|Bakersfield Station]] built in 2000, near Truxtun Avenue and S Street.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bakersfield, CA (BFD) – Great American Stations |url=https://www.greatamericanstations.com/stations/bakersfield-ca-bfd/ |access-date=December 24, 2023 |language=en-US |archive-date=December 24, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231224072040/https://www.greatamericanstations.com/stations/bakersfield-ca-bfd/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The earthquake's destructive force bent cotton fields into U shapes, slid a shoulder of the [[Tehachapi Mountains]] across all four lanes of the [[Ridge Route]], collapsed a water tower, creating a flash flood, and destroyed the railroad tunnels in the mountain chain.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Bakersfield was somewhat spared, experiencing minor architectural damage without loss of life.

A large [[aftershock]] occurred on July 29, causing minor architectural damage but raising fears that the flow of the [[Friant-Kern Canal]] could be dangerously altered, potentially flooding the city and surrounding areas.

Aftershocks continued for the next month, and on August 22 at 3:42&nbsp;pm, another earthquake, measured at 5.8, struck directly under the city's center in the most densely populated area of the southern [[San Joaquin Valley]]. Four people died in the aftershock, and many of the town's historic structures sustained heavy damage.

=== Historic architecture and preservation ===
{{Main|Bakersfield Register of Historic Places and Areas of Historic Interest}}
Bakersfield has several buildings and locations designated as historic sites at the national, state, and city levels. Five buildings have been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP), including the [[First Baptist Church (Bakersfield, California)|First Baptist Church]] (NRHP 1/2/79); [[Kern Branch, Beale Memorial Library|Baker Street Library]] (NRHP 4/1/81) and [[Bakersfield Californian Building]] (NRHP 3/10/83). Four sites have been designated as [[California Historical Landmark]]s, including [[Garces Memorial Circle]] (designated in 1937) and the [[Colonel Thomas Baker Memorial]] (designated in 1944). In addition, 16 sites have been locally designated on the [[Bakersfield Register of Historic Places]], including the [[Fox Theater (Bakersfield, California)|Fox Theater]] (designated 8/24/94) and [[Kern County Chamber of Commerce Building]] (designated 3/12/08). With only 16 sites on its local register (compared to more than 300 sites designated by the City of [[Fresno, California|Fresno]]), Bakersfield has been criticized for its lack of focus on historic preservation.<ref>{{cite news |title=Downtown building may be fostering changes |newspaper=The Bakersfield Californian |author=Steven Mayer |date=May 10, 2014 |url=https://www.bakersfield.com/news/downtown-building-may-be-fostering-changes/article_e781b184-77b5-5afd-85c4-6c2fe7bf8fe9.html |access-date=July 8, 2019 |archive-date=July 8, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190708202213/https://www.bakersfield.com/news/downtown-building-may-be-fostering-changes/article_e781b184-77b5-5afd-85c4-6c2fe7bf8fe9.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:2009-0726-CA-Bakersfield-TruxtonTower.jpg|thumb|Truxtun Tower, also referred to as the Bank of America Building, is the tallest in downtown and the second-tallest building in Bakersfield.]]
Bakersfield is located near the southern end of the [[San Joaquin Valley]], with the southern tip of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] just to the east. The city limits extend to the [[Sequoia National Forest]], at the foot of the Greenhorn Mountain Range and the entrance to the Kern Canyon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bakersfieldhelpwanted.org/ |title=Bakersfield Geography |work=source |date=2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011234406/http://www.bakersfieldhelpwanted.org/ |archive-date=October 11, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> To the south, the [[Tehachapi Mountains]], rising more than a vertical mile, feature the historic [[Tejon Ranch]]. To the west is the [[Temblor Range]], behind which is the [[Carrizo Plain National Monument]] and the [[San Andreas Fault]]. The Temblor Range is about {{cvt|35|mi|km}} from Bakersfield across the valley floor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/earthq3/ |title=The San Andreas Fault |work=USGS General Interest Publications |date=2010 |access-date=January 25, 2010 |archive-date=February 6, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206042439/http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/earthq3/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{cvt|143.6|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{cvt|142.2|sqmi}} are land (98.99%) and {{cvt|1.4|sqmi}} are covered by water (1.01%).

At the 2000 census, the city had a total area of {{cvt|114.4|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{cvt|113.1|sqmi}} were land (98.86%) and {{cvt|1.3|sqmi}} were water-covered (1.14%).

Bakersfield is located about {{cvt|100|mi}} north of [[Los Angeles]] (about a 1-hour, 45-minute drive on I-5 and State Route 99) and about {{cvt|280|mi}} southeast of the state capital, [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] (about a 4-hour drive on State Route 99).

[[Hart Memorial Park]] is located in northeast Bakersfield along Alfred Harrell Highway.

=== Communities and neighborhoods ===
{{See also|List of neighborhoods in Bakersfield}}
Bakersfield has historically referred to its regions by directional names. They include North Bakersfield, Northeast, Southeast, South Bakersfield, Southwest, and Northwest. East Bakersfield generally refers to the former town of Sumner (later renamed East Bakersfield). As a result, the Northeast wraps around East Bakersfield.<ref>[http://www.kerncog.org/docs/studies/Rt_178_Corridor_Study.pdf Route 178 Corridor Study] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107123903/http://www.kerncog.org/docs/studies/Rt_178_Corridor_Study.pdf |date=January 7, 2011 }}.

Rainfall is low in the city, averaging only {{convert|6.36|in|mm|1}} annually, with most of it falling in the winter. Bakersfield averages about 191 clear days a year.<ref>Ozborn, Liz. [http://www.currentresults.com/Weather-Extremes/US/sunniest.php Sunniest Places in United States] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802073530/http://www.currentresults.com/Weather-Extremes/US/sunniest.php |date=August 2, 2013 }}. Current Results. Retrieved March 13, 2012.</ref> Bakersfield's climate makes the region suitable for growing crops ranging from carrots to citrus and almonds.

Bakersfield summers are sweltering with extended stretches of hot weather and 112 days per year with high temperatures of {{convert|90|°F|°C|1}}+ (on average between April 18 and October 13); in addition, there are 36 days with highs of {{convert|100|°F|°C|1}}+ (on average between June 2 and September 19), and 0.9 days with highs of {{convert|110|°F|1}}+. The frequency of {{convert|110|°F|1}} readings can significantly vary each year, with the record being 17 days in 1931. The most recent year to have more than five days of {{convert|110|°F|1}}+ temperature readings was 2017, with seven days reaching or exceeding {{convert|110|°F|1}}. Temperatures can be highly variable throughout the spring, summer and fall months every year, with triple digit temperature readings in May, and on rare occasion April, and October in addition to occasional high temperatures below {{convert|80|°F|1}} in June and September not being uncommon. The warmest month on record was July 2024, with an average temperature of {{convert|90.8|°F|1}}. Except for occasional monsoons, which may bring light rain, typically no rain or almost no rain will fall from May to September.<ref name=NOAA />

Winters feature mild daytime temperatures and chilly/cold nights. Frost and/or dense fog usually occurs in winter with accompanying low visibility, causing many schools to have fog delays. Winters will usually produce a very dense layer of fog occasionally. Due to years of prolonged drought and the rapid development of many new neighborhoods around Bakersfield, the density of the fog and the number of "fog days" has steadily decreased. At the same time, areas outside the city still experience thick fog. The official time frame for [[tule fog]] to form is about five months long – various days from November 1 to March 31. Most noticeable in summer and winter, the [[urban heat island]] phenomenon can be observed throughout various neighborhoods in Bakersfield. Areas closer to downtown and along the 99 freeway corridor can experience warmer temperatures at night than neighborhoods on the edge of the city limits and rural Kern County areas, with temperature differences up to {{convert|7|°F-change|0}} between these areas at any given time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/hnx/newslet/winter00/fogseason.htm |title=About tule fog |work=noaa.gov |access-date=September 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230053005/http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/hnx/newslet/winter00/fogseason.htm |archive-date=December 30, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> On average, ten mornings have freezing lows (on average between December 14 and January 24) annually, and the coldest night of the year typically bottoms out below {{convert|30|°F|°C|1|disp=or}}.<ref name=NOAA /> On January 2, 2012, Bakersfield reached a record high of {{convert|82|°F|1}} for that year's winter.{{citation needed|date=May 2023}}

Spring and fall typically feature mild to warm daytime high temperatures with cool nighttime low temperatures, but temperatures and precipitation can vary significantly depending on the year. More than 50 percent of Bakersfield's annual precipitation falls between January and March, with the remainder falling during late fall and early winter.

Snow is rare on the valley floor, although frost may occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sjgs.com/bakersfield.html |title=Bakersfield Climate |work=San Joaquin Geological Society |access-date=September 25, 2010 |archive-date=July 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716080542/http://www.sjgs.com/bakersfield.html |url-status=dead}}</ref> The last snow fell on January 25, 1999, when the city received up to {{convert|6|in|cm}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ggweather.com |title=Golden Gate Weather Services |publisher=GGWeather.com |access-date=November 29, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219224844/http://ggweather.com/ |archive-date=December 19, 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> with {{convert|3|in|cm}} at the airport.<ref name=NOAA /> The record maximum temperature was {{convert|118|°F|°C|1}} on July 28, 1908, and the record minimum temperature was {{convert|12|°F|°C|1}} on January 3, 1908.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/wrh/techMemos/TM-281.pdf |title=The Climate of Bakersfield, California |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |access-date=February 8, 2010 |author=Chris Stachelski |author2=Gary Sanger |year=2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624125728/http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/wrh/techMemos/TM-281.pdf |archive-date=June 24, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=NOAA /> The most rainfall in one month was {{convert|5.82|in|mm|1}} in December 2010,<ref>{{cite web |title=Bakersfield Monthly Rainfall By Year |url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/hnx/bfl/normals/bflrnyr.pdf |publisher=National Weather Service |access-date=October 16, 2021 |archive-date=July 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717231340/http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/hnx/bfl/normals/bflrnyr.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> and the maximum 24-hour rainfall was {{convert|2.29|in|mm|1}} on February 9, 1978.

=== Housing and development ===
Bakersfield saw its population grow from about 105,000 in 1980 to over 400,000 in 2020. Although the city is still growing, its growth rate has slowed in recent years due to the economic recession and high home foreclosure rates. However, in October 2013, Bakersfield was found to be the number two city in the nation for the rental market.<ref>"Worth noting in business: Kern's rental market ranks second in [the] U.S." The ''Bakersfield Californian''. October 3, 2013.</ref> Apartment vacancies have become a large issue, with only one percent of potential apartments being open to new renters as of April 2021. The average cost of rent and housing has dramatically increased in the last few years, with some apartments having their monthly rent nearly double in cost. Most new apartments being built are catering to commuting workers from Southern California and the Bay Area, with local residents being priced out.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cox |first=John |date=July 4, 2021 |title=Bakersfield's apartment market sets two new records |url=https://www.bakersfield.com/news/bakersfields-apartment-market-sets-two-new-records/article_31412e10-db81-11eb-86f3-5fcc16fd4439.html |url-status=live |access-date=December 16, 2021 |website=The Bakersfield Californian |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210704225114/https://www.bakersfield.com/news/bakersfields-apartment-market-sets-two-new-records/article_31412e10-db81-11eb-86f3-5fcc16fd4439.html |archive-date=July 4, 2021}}</ref>

The city of [[Shafter, California|Shafter]], a small farming town north of Bakersfield, previously filed a suit to attempt to limit the northern expansion of Bakersfield's city limits.

The large bluff and plateau east of Bakersfield—toward the Rio Bravo and Kern Canyon area—has been under development for the last 60 years. Because the steep, north-facing edge of the bluff provides a view of the foothills, mountains, oil fields, and Kern River, the city government has attempted to balance development and preservation in this area.

== Education ==
[[File:Walter Stiern Library, CSUB.jpg|thumb|right|CSUB's Walter Stiern Library]]

Two of the earliest schools founded in Kern County were Mrs. Thomas Baker's school, opened in 1863 at the Baker home (near present-day 19th and N streets), and a Catholic parochial school opened by Reverend Father Daniel Dade in 1865 in Havilah (then the county seat). In 1880, Norris School was established. The land for this school was donated by William Norris, a local farmer. Thirteen to twenty students were taught in its one classroom during the 1880s. [[Bakersfield City School District]] (BCSD) is the state's largest elementary school district. The first high school in Bakersfield, Kern County Union High School, opened in 1893. It was renamed [[Bakersfield High School]] after World War II.

The site at California Avenue and F Street is the location of the first campus of [[Bakersfield College]], which was established in 1913 and relocated in 1956 to its current location overlooking the Panorama Bluffs in northeast Bakersfield. Bakersfield College has an enrollment of 16,000 students. To serve a growing [[baby-boomer]] population after [[World War II]], the Kern High School District has steadily expanded to nineteen campuses and more than 35,000 students, making it the largest high school district in the state. In 1965, a university in the [[California State University]] system was founded in Bakersfield. [[California State University, Bakersfield]] (CSUB) has approximately 10,000 students. It was an NCAA Division II sports powerhouse in the [[California Collegiate Athletic Association]] (CCAA) with some sports, including wrestling (Pac-10), competing in Division I. CSUB has become a Division I athletic school and will join the [[Big West Conference]] in 2020. In 1982, the Bakersfield campus for [[Santa Barbara Business College]] was founded.

Bakersfield is serviced by an extensive highway network which includes three freeways. [[California State Route 99|State Route 99]] bisects Bakersfield from north to south. At the same time, [[California State Route 58|State Route 58]] exists as a freeway east of SR 99, serving the southeast part of the city and extending over the Tehachapi mountains to [[Tehachapi, California|Tehachapi]], [[Mojave, California|Mojave]], and [[Barstow, California|Barstow]]. [[California State Route 178|State Route 178]] consists of a short segment of freeway that runs from a point near downtown to the northeastern part of the city, although there is currently no direct freeway connection between SR 99 and SR 178. [[Interstate 5 (California)|Interstate 5]] bypasses the city several miles to the west.

Bakersfield is also served by a short, unsigned, four-lane freeway called Alfred Harrell Highway. It was constructed between 1956 and 1958 and extends from China Grade Loop to Hart Park (a large recreation park in northeast Bakersfield). There is also a two-lane expressway to the east of the park. This section was initially reserved to be converted to a four-lane freeway similar to the constructed western portion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scvresources.com/highways/alfred_harrell_hwy/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130411185135/http://www.scvresources.com/highways/alfred_harrell_hwy/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 11, 2013 |title=Alfred Harrell Highway-Bakersfield |publisher=Los Angeles Rocks 'n Roads |access-date=August 6, 2009}}</ref> If it were ever constructed, it would have two interchanges (at Morning Drive and Lake Ming Road) and would terminate at the SR 178 adopted alignment (not built).

Both SR 58 and SR 178 have planned extensions. The western extension of SR 58 is known as the [[Centennial Corridor]], which will extend the freeway west to I-5.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist6/environmental/projects/centennial/projectdescription.html |title=Centennial Corridor Project Description |publisher=TRIP (Thomas Roads Improvement Program) |access-date=September 29, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001134240/http://dot.ca.gov/dist6/environmental/projects/centennial/projectdescription.html |archive-date=October 1, 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref> Included in the Centennial Corridor is the [[Westside Parkway]] (sometimes referred to by its formal name, the Kern River Freeway).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bakersfieldfreeways.us/project_westside_parkway.html |title=Westside Parkway |publisher=TRIP (Thomas Roads Improvement Program) |access-date=September 29, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091020160148/http://www.bakersfieldfreeways.us/project_westside_parkway.html |archive-date=October 20, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> This is a newer freeway which runs through western Bakersfield, on a route parallel to the Kern River and Stockdale Highway. The western extension of SR 178 is known as the Crosstown Freeway/SR 178 Connection, although it was formerly known as the Centennial Corridor before that name was moved to SR 58. It is planned to connect SR 178 to the Westside Parkway.<ref>Progress Report 2008/2009. TRIP (Thomas Roads Improvement Program). Page 7.</ref>

In addition to these freeway extensions, there is also a proposed network of [[beltway]]s. Currently, two beltways are being considered in Bakersfield. The West Beltway would run north–south from Seventh Standard Road to Taft Highway. It will run parallel to Heath Road to the north and parallel to South Allen Road to the south.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bakersfieldfreeways.us/project_west_beltway.html |title=West Beltway |publisher=TRIP (Thomas Roads Improvement Program) |access-date=September 29, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091020160126/http://www.bakersfieldfreeways.us/project_west_beltway.html |archive-date=October 20, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> A future extension would connect the West Beltway to SR 99 and I-5, providing a bypass to Bakersfield. The South Beltway would run east–west from SR 58 to I-5. From SR 58, it would run south, parallel to Comanche Drive until Taft Highway. From there, the freeway would turn west and run parallel to Taft Highway until terminating at I-5.

A future extension would extend the freeway north to SR 178 and terminate at Alfred Harrell Highway. Bakersfield also envisioned Caltrans building a North Beltway as the western extension of SR 58, but this has been withdrawn in favor of the Centennial Corridor.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Most of Bakersfield's major streets are six-lane divided roads with bike lanes, with most streets in the city having proper lane signage for bicycle traffic but little to no protection from vehicle traffic. Despite the city's relatively flat topography and grid-like street system, only around 2,782 bike commuters exist, as estimated in 2013, around 0.7% of its total population then.<ref>{{Cite web |date=November 2013 |title=City of Bakersfield Bicycle Transportation Plan |url=https://www.kerncog.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2013_BakersfieldBikePlan.pdf |access-date=December 23, 2023 |website=Kern County Council of Government |page=38 |archive-date=December 24, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231224080119/https://www.kerncog.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2013_BakersfieldBikePlan.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

Newer neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city, previously surrounded by two-lane farm roads, are prompting more large, divided roads to be built to help ease the increase in traffic that has resulted from the rise in population. Many developers choose to widen the roads that connect these neighborhoods at their own discretion, which can cause a major road to widen and narrow repeatedly over a short distance (Allen Road and Panama Lane are prime examples). Since the Bakersfield city limit boundaries are not uniform, this can cause Kern County "islands" to exist within Bakersfield. The county of Kern may choose not to upgrade a road while the city of Bakersfield does improve a road, which can cause traffic congestion to increase (Calloway Drive from the Westside Parkway north to Rosedale Highway best exemplifies this disparity).{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}

Bakersfield is currently one of the largest cities in the U.S. that is not directly linked to an [[Interstate highway]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-005.html |title=Interstate 5 @ Interstate-Guide.com |publisher=Interstate-guide.com |access-date=November 29, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220135850/http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-005.html |archive-date=December 20, 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> However, SR 99 and SR 58 have been considered for conversion to Interstates. SR 99 would be a new Interstate signed either as Interstate 7 or [[Interstate 9 (California)|Interstate 9]], while SR 58 would be an extension of [[Interstate 40 (California)|I-40]], which currently terminates in Barstow. In 2005, SR 99 was added to the FHWA list of high-priority corridors as "California [[farm-to-market road|farm to market route]]" and designated a [[Future Interstate Highways|Future Interstate]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-009.html |title=Interstate 9 |publisher=AARoads Interstate Guide |access-date=September 29, 2009 |archive-date=April 5, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405073713/http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-009.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cahighways.org/057-064.html |title=State Route 58 |publisher=California Highways |access-date=September 29, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002011343/http://www.cahighways.org/057-064.html |archive-date=October 2, 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Garces Memorial Traffic Circle, informally known as Garces Circle or just "the Circle," is a [[traffic circle]] in Bakersfield. The traffic circle is located at the intersection of Chester Avenue, Golden State Avenue ([[Route 204 (California)|State Route 204]]), and 30th Street. The Circle was built circa 1932 as a part of [[US 99]]. A large sculpture of [[Francisco Garces]] was erected inside the circle in 1939.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Garces Circle Statue – Bakersfield CA |url=https://livingnewdeal.org/projects/garces-circle-statue-bakersfield-ca/ |access-date=July 27, 2020 |website=Living New Deal |language=en-US |archive-date=December 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191222083455/https://livingnewdeal.org/projects/garces-circle-statue-bakersfield-ca/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

== In popular culture ==
Bakersfield appears in the 1997 [[role-playing video game]] [[Fallout (video game)|''Fallout'']] under the name of ''Necropolis''. The city was destroyed and abandoned after being hit by [[nuclear weapon|nuclear bombs]]. Later, [[Ghoul (Fallout)|ghouls]], humans whose flesh had been destroyed and ravaged by radiation, moved into the city and resided there in isolation for several decades before it was invaded by the [[Super Mutants|Unity]].

In their song "Far Away Eyes" (off the 1978 ''Some Girls'' album), the Rolling Stones briefly reference Bakersfield. Lead singer Mick Jagger, emulating a quasi-spoken Southern drawl, narrates:
<blockquote>
I was driving home, early Sunday morning, through Bakersfield<br>
Listening to gospel music on the colored radio station<br>
And the preacher said, "You know, you always have the Lord by your side"<br>
Well, I was so pleased to be informed of this<br>
That I ran twenty red lights, in his honor<br>
Thank you Jesus . . . Thank you, Lord
</blockquote>
