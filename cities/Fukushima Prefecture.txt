===Prehistory===
[[File:20091231大安場古墳群1号墳.jpg|thumb|The [[Ōyasuba Kofun]] in the [[Tohoku region]]]]
The keyhole-shaped [[Ōyasuba Kofun]] is the largest [[kofun]] in the [[Tohoku region]]. The site was designated a [[Monuments of Japan|National Historic Site of Japan]] in 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://bunka.nii.ac.jp/heritages/detail/218189 |title= 大安場古墳群|language=ja |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] }}</ref>

===Classical and feudal period===
[[File:Shiramizu_amidadou.jpg|thumb|[[Buddhist]] chapel [[Shiramizu Amidadō]]]]

Until the [[Meiji Restoration]], the area of Fukushima prefecture was part of what was known as [[Mutsu Province]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Provinces and prefectures" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 780|page=780}}</ref>

The [[Shirakawa Barrier]] and the Nakoso Barrier were built around the 5th century to protect 'the heathens' from the 'barbarians' to the north. Fukushima became a province of [[Mutsu Province|Mutsu]] after the [[Taika Reform]]s were established in 646.<ref>Takeda, Toru ''et al.'' (2001). ''Fukushima – Today & Tomorrow,'' p. 10.</ref>

In 718, the provinces of [[Iwase Province|Iwase]] and [[Iwaki Province (718)|Iwaki]] were created, but these areas reverted to Mutsu some time between 722 and 724.<ref>Meyners d'Estrey, Guillaume Henry Jean (1884). {{Google books|gzEwAAAAYAAJ|''Annales de l'Extrême Orient et de l'Afrique,'' Vol. 6, p. 172|page=172}}; Nussbaum, "Iwaki" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 408|page=408}}</ref>

The [[Shiramizu Amidadō]] is a [[Dō (architecture)|chapel]] within the [[Buddhist]] temple Ganjō-ji in [[Iwaki, Fukushima|Iwaki]]. It was built in 1160 and it is a [[National Treasures of Japan|National Treasure]]. The temple, including the [[Japanese gardens|paradise garden]] is an [[Monuments of Japan|Historic Site]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kunishitei.bunka.go.jp/heritage/detail/401/382 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191223161141/https://kunishitei.bunka.go.jp/heritage/detail/401/382 |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 December 2019 |title=Database of Registered National Cultural Properties |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |access-date=4 May 2011 }}</ref>

===Contemporary period===
This region of Japan is also known as Michinoku and Ōshū.

The [[Fukushima incident (1882)|Fukushima Incident]], a political tumult, took place in the prefecture after [[Mishima Michitsune]] was appointed governor in 1882.

On Friday, March 11, 2011, 14:46 [[Japan Standard Time|JST]], a [[Moment magnitude scale|magnitude]] 9.0 [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake]] occurred off the coast of [[Miyagi Prefecture]]. [[Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale|Shindo]] measurements throughout the prefecture reached as high as 6-upper in isolated regions of [[Hamadōri|Hama-dōri]] on the eastern coast and as low as a 2 in portions of the [[Aizu]] region in the western part of the prefecture.

In the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami that followed, the outer housings of two of the six reactors at the [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]] in [[Ōkuma, Fukushima|Ōkuma]] exploded followed by a partial meltdown and fires at three of the other units. Many residents were evacuated to nearby localities due to the development of a large evacuation zone around the plant. Radiation levels near the plant peaked at 400 mSv/h ([[millisievert]]s per hour) after the earthquake and tsunami, due to damage sustained. This resulted in increased recorded radiation levels across Japan.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12740843 | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Japan quake: Radiation rises at Fukushima nuclear plant | date=March 15, 2011}}</ref> On April 11, 2011, officials upgraded the disaster to a level 7 out of a possible 7, a rare occurrence not seen since the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in 1986.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2011/04/fukushima-crisis-raised-to-lev.html|publisher=[[New Scientist]]|title=Fukushima crisis raised to level 7, still no Chernobyl|date=April 12, 2011}}</ref>
Several months later, officials announced that although the area nearest the melt down were still off limits, areas near the twenty kilometer radial safe zone could start seeing a return of the close to 47,000 residents that had been evacuated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Fukushima-accident|title=Fukushima accident|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=February 17, 2019}}</ref>

With an area size of {{convert|13784|km2|abbr=on}} it is the third-largest prefecture of Japan, behind [[Hokkaido]] and [[Iwate Prefecture]]. It is divided by mountain ranges into three regions called (from west to east) [[Aizu]], [[Nakadōri]], and [[Hamadōri]].

[[Fukushima city]] is located in the Fukushima Basin's southwest area and nearby mountains. Located on the central eastern seaboard a part of the Pacifim rim. A region with high tectonic activity given its location where the Pacific and Eurasian continental plates collide - a part the [[Ring of Fire]].

The coastal region traditionally specializes in fishing and seafood industries, and is notable for its electric and particularly nuclear power-generating industry, while the upland regions are more focused on agriculture. Thanks to Fukushima's climate, various fruits are grown throughout the year. These include pears, peaches, cherries, grapes, and apples.<ref name="JNTO Fukushima City">{{cite web|url=http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/regional/fukushima/fukushima_city.html|title=Fukushima City|publisher=Japan National Tourism Organization|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925190812/http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/regional/fukushima/fukushima_city.html|archive-date=September 25, 2017}}</ref> {{as of|2011|03|post=,}} the prefecture produced 20.6% of Japan's peaches and 8.7% of cucumbers.<ref>Schreiber, Mark, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fd20110417bj.html Japan's food crisis goes beyond recent panic buying] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420001603/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fd20110417bj.html |date=April 20, 2011 }}", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', April 17, 2011, p. 9.</ref><ref>Hongo, Jun, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120320i1.html Fukushima not just about nuke crisis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101153611/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120320i1.html |date=November 1, 2012 }}", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', March 20, 2012, p. 3.</ref>

Lacquerware is another popular product from Fukushima. Dating back over four hundred years, the process of making lacquerware involves carving an object out of wood, then putting a lacquer on it and decorating it. Objects made are usually dishes, vases and writing materials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tif.ne.jp/lang/en/sightseeing/detail.php?id=60&category=7|title=Aizu lacquerware|publisher=Fukushima Prefecture Tourism & Local Products Association|access-date=February 17, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://rediscoverfukushima.com/2018/06/20/aizu-urushi-chopstick-making-experience/|title=Make Your Own Aizu Lacquerware Chopsticks|website=Rediscover Fukushima|date=June 20, 2018|access-date=February 17, 2019|archive-date=January 11, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200111081909/https://rediscoverfukushima.com/2018/06/20/aizu-urushi-chopstick-making-experience/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Culture ==
[[File:Akabeko0926.jpg|thumb|[[Akabeko]]]]
Legend has it that an ogress, Adachigahara, once roamed the plain after whom it was named. The Adachigahara plain lies close to the city of Fukushima.

Other stories, such as that of a large, strong, red cow that carried wood, influenced toys and superstitions. The [[Akabeko]] cow is a small, red papier-mâché cow on a bamboo or wooden frame, and is believed to ease child birth, bring good health, and help children grow up as strong as the cow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tif.ne.jp/lang/en/sightseeing/detail.php?id=58&category=7|title=Akabeko Red Cows|publisher=Fukushima Prefecture Tourism & Local Products Association|access-date=February 17, 2019}}</ref>

Another superstitious talisman of the region is the ''[[Okiagari-koboshi]]'', or self-righting dharma doll. These dolls are seen as bringers of good luck and prosperity because they stand right back up when knocked down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tif.ne.jp/lang/en/sightseeing/detail.php?id=56&category=7|title=Okiagari Ko-boshi (self-righting dharma doll)|publisher=Fukushima Prefecture Tourism & Local Products Association|access-date=February 17, 2019}}</ref>

''[[Miharu-goma]]'' are small, wooden, black or white toy horses painted with colorful designs. Depending upon their design, they may be believed to bring things like long life to the owner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tif.ne.jp/lang/en/sightseeing/detail.php?id=59&category=7|title=Miharu Koma|publisher=Fukushima Prefecture Tourism & Local Products Association|access-date=February 17, 2019}}</ref>

Kokeshi dolls, while less symbolic, are also a popular traditional craft. They are carved wooden dolls, with large round heads and hand painted bodies. Kokeshi dolls are popular throughout many regions of Japan, but Fukushima is credited as their birthplace.<ref name="JNTO Fukushima City"/>

The Aizu festival is a celebration of the time of the samurai. It begins with a display of sword dancing and fighting, and is followed by a procession of around five hundred people. The people in the procession carry flags and tools representing well-known feudal lords of long ago, and some are actually dressed like the lords themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tif.ne.jp/lang/en/festivals/detail.php?id=13&category=3|title=Aizu Festival|publisher=Fukushima Prefecture Tourism & Local Products Association|access-date=February 17, 2019}}</ref>

* Taimatsu Akashi Fire Festival

A reflection of a long ago time of war, the Taimatsu Akashi Festival consists of men and women carrying large symbolic torches lit with a sacred fire to the top of Mt. Gorozan. Accompanied by drummers, the torchbearers reach the top and light a wooden frame representing an old local castle and the samurai that lived there. In more recent years the festival has been opened up so that anyone wanting to participate may carry a small symbolic torch along with the procession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tif.ne.jp/lang/en/festivals/detail.php?id=21&category=4|title=Taimatsu Akashi|publisher=Fukushima Prefecture Tourism & Local Products Association|access-date=February 17, 2019}}</ref>

[[File:Miharu_Miharu-Takizakura_Front_1.jpg|thumb|Miharu Takizakura is an ancient cherry tree in Miharu, Fukushima.]]

Tsuruga castle, a samurai castle originally built in the late 14th century, was occupied by the region's governor in the mid-19th century, during a time of war and governmental instability. Because of this, [[Aizuwakamatsu]] was the site of an important battle in the [[Boshin War]], during which 19 teenage members of the [[Byakkotai]] committed ritual [[seppuku]] suicide. Their graves on Mt. Iimori are a popular tourist attraction.<ref name="JNTO Aizuwakamatsu Area"/>

[[Kitakata, Fukushima|Kitakata]] is well known for its distinctive [[Kitakata Ramen|Kitakata ramen]] noodles and well-preserved traditional storehouse buildings, while [[Ōuchi-juku]] in the town of Shimogo retains numerous thatched buildings from the [[Edo period]].

[[Mount Bandai]], in the [[Bandai-Asahi National Park]], erupted in 1888, creating a large crater and numerous lakes, including the picturesque 'Five Coloured Lakes' ([[Goshiki-numa]]). Bird watching crowds are not uncommon during migration season here. The area is popular with hikers and skiers. Guided snowshoe tours are also offered in the winter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/regional/fukushima/urabandai.html|title=Ura-bandai Area|publisher=Japan National Tourism Organization|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815095034/http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/regional/fukushima/urabandai.html|archive-date=August 15, 2017}}</ref>

Niboshi (sardines), tonkotsu (pig bones) and sometimes chicken and vegetables are boiled to make the stock. This is then topped with chashu (thinly sliced barbeque pork), spring onions, fermented bamboo shoots, and sometimes [[narutomaki]], a pink and white swirl of cured fish cake.<ref name=":0" />

'''Mamador''' is the prefecture's most famous confection.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://kaumo.jp/topic/47178|title=福島の人気お土産50選｜ままどおるだけじゃない！福島のおすすめお菓子-カウモ|newspaper=カウモ|access-date=October 24, 2016|archive-date=September 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180920234623/https://kaumo.jp/topic/47178|url-status=dead}}</ref> The baked good has a milky red bean flavor center wrapped in a buttery dough.

Creambox is prefecture's second famous confection. It is a sweet bread with a thick milk bread and white milk-flavored cream. It is sold in Koriyama City at many bakery and school purchases . The selling price is usually around 100 yen, and in some rare cases, the dough is round.
Since it looks simple and does not change much from normal bread when viewed from above, some processing may be performed on the cream, there are things that put almonds or draw the character's face with chocolate
