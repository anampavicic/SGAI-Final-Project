==History==

{{Main|History of Stamford, Connecticut}}
Stamford was known as Rippowam by the [[Siwanoy]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] inhabitants of the region, and the very first [[Europe]]an settlers in the area also called it that. The present name is after the town of [[Stamford, Lincolnshire]], England.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Connecticut Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qoEyAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA334|year=1903|publisher=Connecticut Magazine Company|page=334}}</ref> The [[deed]] to Stamford was signed on July 1, 1640, between Captain Turner of the [[New Haven Colony]] and Chief Ponus. By the 18th century, one of the town's primary industries was merchandising by water, which was possible due to Stamford's proximity to New York.

In 1692, Stamford was home to a less famous [[witch trial]] than the well-known [[Salem witch trials]], which also occurred in 1692. The accusations were less fanatical and on a smaller scale, but they also grew to prominence through gossip and hysterics.<ref name="singular">{{Cite book|last=Godbeer|first=Richard|title=Escaping Salem|date=January 2005|publisher=Oxford|isbn=0-19-516130-0| chapter=Chapter 1: Katherine Branch's Fits}}</ref>

[[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]] officially separated from Stamford when it incorporated as a town in 1801, followed by [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]] in 1820.

Starting in the late 19th century, New York residents built summer homes on the shoreline, and some moved to Stamford permanently and started commuting to Manhattan by train. Stamford incorporated as a city in 1893.

In 1950, the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] reported the city's population as 94.6% white and 5.2% black.<ref>{{cite web |title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archive-date=August 12, 2012 |access-date=December 7, 2017 }}</ref>

In the 1960s and 1970s, Stamford's commercial real estate boomed as corporations relocated from New York City to peripheral areas.<ref>{{cite crabgrass}}, p.268</ref> A massive urban redevelopment campaign during that time resulted in a downtown with many tall office buildings. The F.D. Rich Company was the city-designated urban renewal developer of the downtown area in an ongoing, contentious project beginning in the 1960s and continuing through the 1970s. The company put up what was the city's tallest structure, [[One Landmark Square]], at 21 floors high, and the GTE building (now One Stamford Forum), along with the Marriott Hotel, the [[Stamford Town Center]] and many other downtown office buildings. One Landmark Square has since been dwarfed by the new 34-story [[Park Tower Stamford]] condominium tower, and again by the Atlantic Station development, another Rich Company project in partnership with Cappelli Enterprises.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/26/realestate/commercial-property-stamford-conn-pioneer-business-park-that-confounded-critics.html|title=Commercial Property /Stamford, Conn.; A Pioneer Business Park That Confounded Critics|first=Eleanor|last=Charles|date=September 26, 1999|website=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=March 26, 2018|archive-date=September 27, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180927012833/https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/26/realestate/commercial-property-stamford-conn-pioneer-business-park-that-confounded-critics.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Over the years, other developers have joined in building up the downtown, a process that continued through the 1980s and 1990s and into the new century.

Since 2008, an {{convert|80|acre|ha|abbr=off|adj=on}} mixed-use redevelopment project for Stamford's [[Harbor Point (Stamford)|Harbor Point]] neighborhood has added additional growth south of downtown. The redevelopment plan included {{convert|6|e6sqft|m2|spell=in}} of new residential, retail, office and hotel space, and a marina. In July 2012, roughly 900 of the projected 4,000 Harbor Point residential units had been constructed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Trending-Why-one-city-is-booming-4540657.php|title=Trending: Why one city is booming|work=Connecticut Post|date=May 23, 2013|access-date=May 27, 2013|archive-date=May 23, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523114237/http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Trending-Why-one-city-is-booming-4540657.php|url-status=live}}</ref> New restaurants and recreational activities have come up in the Harbor Point area, which is considered New Stamford.

Stamford is near the southwestern point of Connecticut, on [[Long Island Sound]]; it is part of the [[Gold Coast (Connecticut)|Gold Coast]]. Stamford comprises approximately 45 distinct neighborhoods and villages, and two historic districts,<ref>{{cite web|title=Stamford, CT neighborhood Map—Best and Worst Neighborhoods|url=http://www.areavibes.com/stamford-ct/neighborhoods/|access-date=February 11, 2017|website=[[AreaVibes]]|language=en|archive-date=February 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212163940/http://www.areavibes.com/stamford-ct/neighborhoods/|url-status=live}}</ref> including [[The Cove, Stamford, Connecticut|Cove]], [[East Side of Stamford|East Side]], [[Downtown Stamford|Downtown]], [[North Stamford]], [[Glenbrook (Stamford)|Glenbrook]], [[West Side of Stamford|West Side]], [[Turn-of-River Bridge|Turn of River]], Waterside, [[Springdale (Stamford)|Springdale]], Belltown, Ridgeway, Newfield, [[South End of Stamford|South End]], [[Westover, Stamford, Connecticut|Westover]], [[Shippan Point|Shippan]], Roxbury, and Palmers Hill.

North of the [[Merritt Parkway]] is considered the [[North Stamford]] section of the city, encompassing its largest land mass though it is the least densely populated. North Stamford functionally and legally acts as one municipality with the city of Stamford. Stamford borders [[Pound Ridge, New York|Pound Ridge]], [[New York (state)|New York]] to the north, the Long Island Sound to the south, [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] to the west, [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]] to the east, and [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]] to the northeast.

The city has islands in Long Island Sound: [[Cove Island Park|Cove Island]], Grass Island, Greenway Island, Jack Island, and [[Cuties Island]] (also known as Vincent Island). Cove Island is a prominent beach and recreation area. It lies approximately {{convert|9|mi|km|abbr=off|sp=us}} from Norwalk.

===Climate===
[[File:Stamford Harbor Point Marina.jpg|thumb|Harbor Point Marina in Stamford in August 2018]]
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Stamford has a [[temperate climate]] (''Cfa''), with long, hot summers, and cool to cold winters, with precipitation spread fairly evenly throughout the year. Like the rest of coastal Connecticut, it lies in the broad transition zone between the colder continental climates of the northern U.S. and southern Canada to the north, and the warmer temperate and subtropical climates of the middle and [[south Atlantic states]] to the south.

The warm/hot season in Stamford is from mid-April through early November. Late day thundershowers are common in the hottest months (June through September), despite the mostly sunny skies. The cool/cold season is from late November though mid-March. Winter weather is far more variable than summer weather along the Connecticut coast, ranging from sunny days with higher temperatures to cold and blustery conditions with occasional snow. As on much of the Connecticut coast and nearby Long Island, some of the winter precipitation is rain or a mix and rain and wet snow. Stamford averages about {{convert|30|in|cm|round=5}} of snow annually, compared to inland areas like [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] and [[Albany, New York|Albany]] that average {{convert|45-60|in|cm}}.

Although infrequent, [[tropical cyclones]] (hurricanes/tropical storms) have struck Connecticut and the Stamford metropolitan area. Hurricane landfalls have occurred along the Connecticut coast in 1903, 1938, 1944, 1954 (Carol), 1960 (Donna), [[Hurricane Gloria]] in 1985, and [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012.

Stamford lies in [[USDA]] garden zone 7a. It averages about 90 days annually with freeze. Coastal Connecticut is the broad transition zone where so-called "subtropical indicator" plants and other broadleaf evergreens can be cultivated. As such, Southern Magnolias, Needle Palms, Windmill palm, Loblolly Pines, and Crape Myrtles are grown in private and public gardens. As in much of coastal Connecticut, Long Island, and coastal [[New Jersey]], the growing season is rather long in Stamford, averaging 210 days from April{{nbsp}}8 to November{{nbsp}}5 according to the National Weather Service in Bridgeport.

=== Crime ===
According to FBI statistics in 2014, Stamford is the 16th safest of the 269 cities in the nation and well ahead of any in Connecticut with a population greater than 100,000 that report crime statistics to the FBI.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Stamford-police-say-downtown-is-safe-despite-6134408.php|title=Stamford police say downtown is safe, despite homicide and other recent crimes|website=Stamfordadvocate.com|date=March 15, 2015|access-date=August 6, 2017|archive-date=August 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806100422/http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Stamford-police-say-downtown-is-safe-despite-6134408.php|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2015, Stamford reported three murders, 19 rapes, and 92 robberies. Crime in Stamford is much more controlled in comparison to cities with similar population size in Connecticut and nationally. Lower crime rates in Stamford are attributed to the city's robust economic growth in recent decades. Criminal cases are prosecuted by the State's Attorney's Office, and Stamford is home to a State Superior Court, at 123 Hoyt Street, adjacent to the Stamford Police Headquarters.

===Buses===
City bus transportation is provided by [[Connecticut Transit Stamford|CT Transit]], which is run and financed by the Connecticut Department of Transportation. The main terminal is adjacent to the train station on State Street, under the I-95 highway. Bus service runs along major arterial roads through the towns of [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] and [[Port Chester, New York]]. A non-stop direct route is also offered to [[White Plains, New York]]. Commuters can connect in Norwalk to points as far east as [[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]] and as far north as [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]]. Additional connections can be made in Port Chester and White Plains to all points covered by the [[Bee-Line Bus System|Bee-Line bus system]] in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].

[[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] provides inter-city bus service from the lower level of the Stamford train station. Bus service is provided to [[Union Station (New Haven)|New Haven (Union Station)]], [[South Station|Boston (South Station)]], and [[Port Authority Bus Terminal|New York (Port Authority)]].

===Highways===
Two limited-access highways run through the city. [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|Interstate 95]] serves as the main route through downtown Stamford with four exits (6–9). The [[Merritt Parkway]] runs through the northern part of the city. This road is designated for passenger vehicles only. Any congestion on the Merritt Parkway is mostly likely to occur on the southbound lane in the morning and the northbound in the evening (route to and from New York). At night, due to the absence of lighting, visibility on the Merritt Parkway is relatively poor. Stamford exits on the Merritt Parkway are 33–35, and exit 36 is just over the border in New Canaan.

Stamford is also served by four other state highways. [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|Route{{nbsp}}1]], also known as Main Street in Stamford, is also used as a major artery during the morning and evening commute. Most traffic via Route{{nbsp}}1 is short distance or fairly local, yet vehicles have utilized Route{{nbsp}}1 during times of heavy congestion on I-95 as a re-route. [[Connecticut Route 137|Route 137]] (Washington Boulevard and High Ridge Road) is the main north–south road of the city and runs from the Stamford Transportation Center and serves the Turn of River, North Stamford, and High Ridge sections of the city. [[Connecticut Route 104|Route 104]] (Long Ridge Road) branches off from Route 137 to serve the Long Ridge section. [[Connecticut Route 106|Route 106]] (Courtland Avenue) serves the Glenbrook neighborhood and continues towards the town of [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]].
