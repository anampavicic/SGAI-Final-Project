Harar is the capital city of the [[Harari Region]]. The ancient city is located on a hilltop in the eastern part of the country and is about {{convert|500|km}} from the Ethiopian capital [[Addis Ababa]] at an elevation of {{convert|1885|m}}.

For centuries, Harar has been a major commercial center, linked by the trade routes with the rest of Ethiopia, the entire [[Horn of Africa]], the [[Arabian Peninsula]], Asia, and through its ports, the outside world. Harar Jugol, the old walled city, was listed as a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2006 by [[UNESCO]] in recognition of its cultural heritage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=19189&Cr=world&Cr1=heritage |title=Panda sanctuary, tequila area join UN World Heritage sites |publisher=Un.org |date=13 July 2006 |access-date=23 July 2013}}</ref> Because of Harar's long history of involvement during times of trade in the Arabian Peninsula, the [[Government of Ethiopia]] has made it a criminal offence to demolish or interfere with any historical sites or fixtures in the city.

Yahyá Naṣrallāh's ''Fatḥ Madīnat Harar'', an unpublished history of the city in the 13th century, records that the legendary saint [[Abadir Umar ar-Rida]] and several other religious leaders settled in the Harar plateau {{circa|1216}} (612 [[hijri year|AH]]).<ref name="Uhlig">Siegbert Uhlig, ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: He-N'', Volume 3, (Otto Harrassowitz Verlag: 2007), pp.111 & 319.</ref> Harar was later made the new capital of the [[Adal Sultanate]] in 1520 by the [[Sultan]] [[Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad]].<ref>Richard Pankhurst, ''History of Ethiopian Towns'' (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1982), p. 49.</ref> The city saw a political decline during the ensuing [[Emirate of Harar]], only regaining some significance in the [[Khedivate of Egypt]] period. During the [[Ethiopian Empire]], the city decayed while maintaining a certain cultural prestige.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the name "Harar" remains ambiguous; however, archaeologist Timothy Insoll suggests that it may be derived from [[Harla]], an ancient group that existed prior to the arrival of the [[Oromo people]] in the area.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Insoll |first1=Timothy |title=First Footsteps in the Archaeology of Harar, Ethiopia |publisher=Equinox Publishing Limited |pages=209–210 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VGEJvgEACAAJ}}</ref> Other possible etymologies include ones put forth by British explorer [[Richard Francis Burton]] who states Harar is an extract of the name of a plain located south of the town or a specific tree.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Burton |first1=Richard |title=First Footsteps in East Africa, Or, An Exploration of Harar Volume 2 |publisher=Tylston and Edwards |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mu0MAAAAIAAJ&dq=%22harar%22+is+not+an+uncommon+name+in+this+part+of+eastern+africa+:+according+to+some,+the+city+is+so+called+from+a+kind+of+tree&pg=RA1-PA1}}</ref>

According to the semi-legendary text ''Fatḥ Madīnat Harar'', the founder of the city was saint [[Abadir Umar ar-Rida]], who along with 405 other saints such as [[Yusuf bin Ahmad al-Kawneyn|Aw Barkhadle]], [[Abdirahman bin Isma'il al-Jabarti|Isma'il al-Jabarti]] and Umardin bin Qutbaddan came from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] to settle in the Harar plateau and founded the city circa 612H (1216 CE). Abadir was supposedly met by the [[Argobba people|Argobba]], the [[Gaturi people|Gaturi]] and the [[Harla people]] who accepted his leadership.<ref>{{cite book|last=Braukämper|first=Ulrich|author-link=Ulrich Braukämper|title=Islamic History and Culture in Southern Ethiopia: Collected Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HGnyk8Pg9NgC&pg=PA107|year=2002|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-8258-5671-7}}, page 107</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=History of Harar |page=33 |url=https://www.everythingharar.com/files/History_of_Harar_and_Harari-HNL.pdf}}</ref> In 1234, Abadir returned back to Mecca where he stayed until 1279. In the meantime Harar was ruled by several other saints, most of whom were killed fighting the Christians. Coming back from Mecca, Abadir continued to fight the Christians until his final victory over them in 1301.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Uhlig |first1=Siegbert |title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha |date=2003 |pages=1015}}</ref> According to tradition, Abadir's brother Fakr ad-Din founded the [[Sultanate of Mogadishu]], while one of his descendants founded the [[Hadiya Sultanate]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hassen|first=Mohammed|author-link=Mohammed Hassen|title=The Oromo and the Christian Kingdom of Ethiopia: 1300–1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fg1zCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA99|year=2015|publisher=Boydell & Brewer|isbn=978-1-84701-117-6|page=99}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Luling|first=Virginia|author-link=Virginia Luling|title=Somali Sultanate: The Geledi City-state Over 150 Years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IqgEAAAACAAJ|year=2002|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-7658-0914-8}}</ref>

The first mention of Harar comes from the 14th-century chronicles of [[Amda Seyon I]], according to this text, in 1332 Gēt (Harar) sent 3 ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles#Important regional offices|makonnen]]'' (governors) to support [[Salih (imam)|Salih]] in his rebellion against the Emperor at the [[Battle of Das]].

The [[Walashma dynasty|Walashma]] rulers established their residence in nearby [[Dakkar]], which was likely in very close proximity to Harar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Uhlig |first1=Siegbert |title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha |date=2003 |pages=1015}}</ref>

Tradition states the [[Siltʼe people|Siltʼe]], [[Wolane people|Wolane]], [[Halaba people|Halaba]] and Harari people lived in Harar, while the former three moved to the Gurage region.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Crass|first=Joachim|title=The Qabena and the Wolane: Two peoples of the Gurage region and their respective histories according to their own oral traditions|journal=Annales d'Éthiopie|year=2001|volume=17|issue=1|page=180|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/ethio_0066-2127_2001_num_17_1_997|access-date=15 February 2017}}</ref>

===Adal Sultanate (1520–1647)===
[[File:Harar,_porta_di_buda_03.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Harar city wall built during the Adal Sultanate in the 1500s]]
In 1520, the city became the capital of the [[Adal Sultanate]] under Sultan [[Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad]] after his victory over the religious faction led by [[Abun Adashe]]. At this point, the religious faction fighting against the Walashma came under the control of Imam [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] also known as "Gragn" or "Gurey", both meaning "the Left-handed". The town's clergy attempted to mediate between both sides, but the Imam was strengthened by a recent victory over an Ethiopian raid, and was able to defeat and killed the Sultan in 1525. Imam Ahmad then installed [[Umar Din]] as a puppet sultan and made Harar the center of his various campaigns which ravaged most of Christian Ethiopia.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Uhlig |first1=Siegbert |title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha |date=2003 |pages=1015}}</ref>

After Imam Ahmad's defeat in 1543, his men were dispersed back to the region of Harar. The dead leader’s widow, [[Bati del Wambara]], undertook to renew jihad against the Christians. She invaded the highlands in 1548, but repulsed by Ras Fanu'el. In 1551, [[Nur ibn Mujahid]] married Bati del Wambara and became the new ruler of Harar. In 1559 he departed on a jihad (holy war) to [[Fatager]], during his absence, the Ethiopians under Ras Hamalmal breached the city and killed the last Walashma Sultan [[Barakat ibn Umar Din]]. However this victory was short-lived as Nur was able to defeat and kill [[Gelawdewos]] at the [[Battle of Fatagar]], and brought his head back to Harar in triumph.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Uhlig |first1=Siegbert |title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha |date=2003 |pages=1016}}</ref>

The following years were very difficult for Harar, as the [[Oromo people|Oromo]] were able to intrude on [[Hararghe]] and defeated Nur's army at the [[Battle of Hazalo]]. This prompted Nur to construct a large wall around Harar, which served as a successful bulwark against the Oromo who devastated only the lands around Harar and forced Nur to fight them multiple times. Because of the influx of refugees into the town and the devastation of the region by the Oromo, Harar experienced two severe famines.<ref name="Zekaria">{{cite journal |last=Zekaria |first=Ahmed |title=Harari Coins: A Preliminary Survey |journal=Journal of Ethiopian Studies |year=1991 |volume=24 |pages=23–46 |jstor=41965992 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41965992 |access-date=28 August 2021}}</ref> The prices of food and livestock rose significantly: one ''sa'a'' (a unit equal to four [[handful]]s) of [[sorghum]] cost 12 ''[[ashrafi]]''s, and an equal amount of [[salt]] cost 15.<ref name="Zekaria"/> A cow cost over 300 ashrafis.<ref name="Zekaria"/> The second famine was followed by a plague which eventually killed Nur in 1568, three months after he conducted a campaign against the Oromo.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Uhlig |first1=Siegbert |title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha |date=2003 |pages=1016}}</ref>

After the death of [[Nur ibn Mujahid]], for the next following decade Harar would fall into a state of political instability, mainly due to the pressures of the Oromo. Nur was succeeded by [[Uthman the Abyssinian]], who soon came into conflict with the ''[[ulama]]'' as he did not strictly observe sharia among the nobility and had made a humiliating peace agreement with the pagan Oromo by granting them special privileges. A local official of Aussa named Jibril denounced what he considered Uthman's transgressions against Islamic law. The conflict came to a head when a local Muslim woman who had been taken by the pagan Oromos arrived as a refugee to Aussa. Uthman ordered Jibril to return the woman to the Oromos, Jibril refused, declaring that doing so would be contrary to God's law. Uthman dispatched an army against Jibril, who was defeated and killed. However, while Uthman was gone the clergymen of Harar elected [[Talha ibn Abbas]] as the new leader, he was then able to ambush and defeat Uthman, which led to much rejoicing in the city.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Uhlig |first1=Siegbert |title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha |date=2003 |pages=1016}}</ref>

However Tahla Abbas was again overthrown by some of his very fanatical subjects who still longed for a jihad against Ethiopia. He was replaced by [[Nasir ibn Uthman]], who was almost immediately succeeded by his son, [[Muhammad ibn Nasir]]. He led an unsuccessful fight against the Christians, he met Emperor [[Sarsa Dengel]] at the [[Battle of Webi River]] but was betrayed by his own officers, which led him to get captured and executed by the Emperor with other Harari officials. While he was gone, Harar was attacked by the Oromos, his brother, wazir Hamid ibn Nasir was not able to repulse him, and was wounded in the fight. As a result, a local official named [[Mansur ibn Muhammad]], recruited bands of Somali warriors and repel the Oromo attack, and then subsequently declared himself sultan. After repelling the Oromos, he then turned north against the governor of [[Asaita|Aussa]], but was attacked and killed by his own soldiers. [[Muhammad Gasa]], a descendant of [[Ahmad Gragn]], took advantage of the situation and moved the capital to [[Asaita|Aussa]], thus founding the [[Imamate of Aussa]], from then on Harar was ruled by a local wazir.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Uhlig |first1=Siegbert |title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha |date=2003 |pages=1016}}</ref>

The first wazir to govern Harar under the [[Imamate of Aussa]] was Muhammad Gasa's own brother, Muhammad Gasa II, who later became the Imam in Aussa in 1584. The next year, Harar was ruled by wazir Saddadin, who participated in the war between Muhammad Gasa II and his minister Abbas ibn Muhammad. After this, mentions of Harar in the historical record is sporadic, with the exception of the names of some of its rulers, the first being Sabraddin ibn Adam (1620–5), Sadiq (1632–46) and his son Abram, who only ruled for eleven months.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Uhlig |first1=Siegbert |title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha |date=2003 |pages=1016}}</ref>

===Harar Emirate (1647–1875)===
[[File:Emir Abdullahi.png|thumb|right|200px|[['Abd Allah II ibn 'Ali 'Abd ash-Shakur|Abdullahi]], the last emir of Harar]]
A certain Emir Ahmed, the son of Wazir Abram, had reigned for 10 days when [[`Ali ibn Da`ud]] assumed the throne of Harar, thus founding the [[Emirate of Harar]]. [[`Ali ibn Da`ud]] had risen through the ranks with previous occupations such as being a head of a district and the minister, had declared independence and founded a dynasty that would rule the city for the next two centuries. The reign of Ali saw significant problems with the neighboring Oromos, as on 1 September 1662 Emir Ali ibn Da'ud had to face a violent Illamo Oromo raid which, had reached as near as Asmadin gate and killed his son Sabr ad-Din ibn al-Amir 'Ali b. Da'ud.<ref>Richard Pankhurst, ''The Ethiopian Borderlands'' (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1997), pp. 375–377</ref> Ali's successor, Abdullah, significantly improved relations with the Oromos through an extensive marriage policy by marrying 5 of his sons to Oromo women. The Oromos by now had adopted agriculture and conducted trade with the inhabitants of Harar, allowing them to buy imported goods at the markets of the town. With this, the economic influence of Harar extended from [[Shewa]] to the west and [[Zeila]] to the east, with some overseas connections. The Emirate of Harar also began to mint its own currency, the earliest possible issues bearing a date that may be read as 615 AH (1218/19 CE); but the first coins were definitely issued by 1789 CE, and more were issued into the 19th century.<ref>[[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard Pankhurst]], ''An Introduction to the Economic History of Ethiopia'' (London: Lalibela House, 1961), p. 267.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Uhlig |first1=Siegbert |title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha |date=2003 |pages=1017}}</ref>

Harar began to develop into a major religious center in the region, serving as a source of Islamic proselytization to the surrounding Oromo tribes. In 1761 [[Ahmad I ibn Abi Bakr]] constructed the minaret of the grand mosque, and [[ʽAbd al-Shakur ibn Yusuf]] built a mosque in [[Bale Province, Ethiopia|Bale]]. Abd al-Shakur also reintroduced the register and the chancery in the town, which strengthen the influence of the clergy. The religious importance of Harar can be further seen in the migration of various sharifs from [[Mecca]] to the town around the same time.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Uhlig |first1=Siegbert |title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha |date=2003 |pages=1017}}</ref>

After the death of Emir [[Ahmad II ibn Muhammad]] in 1821, a new conflict arose between the brothers [[ʽAbd ar-Rahman ibn Muhammad]] and [[ʽAbd al-Karim ibn Muhammad]], which gave the surrounding Oromo and Somali tribes an opportunity to interfere in Harari politics. In 1825, the Oromo imprisoned ʽAbd ar-Rahman in [[Fedis (historical region)|Fedis]], he then fled to the Somali tribe of [[Bursuuk|Bersub]]. In the end, ʽAbd ar-Rahman was deposed and forty villages are listed as having been destroyed by the Oromo to the north, west and south of Harar during the civil war. Harar became the home of numerous [[Somalis|Somali]] scholars who came to the city to study the most notable being [[Sheikh Madar]] founder of [[Hargeisa]].<ref name="First Footsteps in East Africa">{{cite book|last=Burton.

During this period slaves of [[Sidama]] and [[Gurage]] stock were important commodities exported to the coast.<ref>{{cite book |last=Toledano |first=Ehud |title=The Ottoman Slave Trade and Its Suppression |date=14 July 2014 |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=31 |isbn=9781400857234 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gOH_AwAAQBAJ&dq=gurage+sidama+harar+slaves&pg=PA31}}</ref> However, at the end of [[Abu Bakr II ibn ʽAbd al-Munan]]'s reign in 1852, the Oromo once again attacked Harar, possibly due to drought. Abu Bakr was forced to pay tribute to the Oromo, which led to an economic crisis and a devaluation in the Harari currency. During the reign of [[Ahmad III ibn Abu Bakr]], Harar was once more besieged by the Oromo for 18 months until Ahmad III agreed to let the Oromo merchants enter the town with their weapons. When Ahmad III died without an heir to his throne, the Oromo helped place [[Muhammad ibn 'Ali 'Abd ash-Shakur]] in power.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Uhlig |first1=Siegbert |title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha |date=2003 |pages=1017}}</ref>

Around this time, Harar was visited by the famous British traveler [[Richard Francis Burton]], he describes Harar during his visit in 1855:<ref>{{cite book |last=Burton |first=Richard |title=First footsteps in East Africa |url=https://burtoniana.org/books/1856-First%20Footsteps%20in%20East%20Africa/1856-FirstFootstepsVer2.htm}}</ref>

Muhammad is said to have oppressed his own people by devaluing the city's currency while extracting a special ''mahalaq al-Oromo'' or Oromo tax.<ref>S.

Until the 1830s, only the [[Babile Oromo]] and groups of mixed Oromo-Somali ethnicity had been converted to Islam to any degree.<ref>Caulk, "Harar Town and Its Neighbours", p.&nbsp;380</ref> Nonetheless, Muhammad lack the power to make much headway in this endeavor, and it was only after the Egyptian conquest that this policy made major strides.<ref>Caulk, "Harar Town and Its Neighbours", p.&nbsp;381</ref>

===Egyptian occupation (1875–1885)===
[[File:Charles George Gordon by Freres.jpg|thumb|right|200px|British administrator [[Charles George Gordon|Charles Gordon]] who visited Harar during the Egyptian occupation]]
Due to the oppressive emir in Harar the Harari opposition requested Egypt intervene to liberate the people in the region.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jalata|first=Asafa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqrNDwAAQBAJ&dq=Harari+Oromo+egypt&pg=PA142|title=The Oromo Movement and Imperial Politics: Culture and Ideology in Oromia and Ethiopia|date=2020-02-28|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-1-7936-0338-8|language=en}}</ref> In October 1878, [[Muhammad Rauf Pasha]] led a well armed Egyptian force of 1,200 men into the interior of eastern Ethiopia and without encountering any opposition, seized Harar on 11 October 1875. A few days later, Emir Muhammad was murdered by an Egyptian [[bashi-bazouk]] while leading evening prayers, his relatives then fled to the countryside to seek refuge among the neighboring Oromos.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Uhlig |first1=Siegbert |title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha |date=2003 |pages=1019}}</ref>

The Egyptians spent much of their time establishing their authority over the surrounding Oromo to secure the caravan routes and attempt the agricultural exploitation of Harar's hinterlands. Rauf Pasha conducted brutal expeditions in the countryside from February to March 1876. Despite this, the Egyptians were never able to pacify the Oromos, and effective Egyptian control rarely reached further then 40 miles away from the city. To strengthen their tedious control of Harar, the Khedive increased its garrison to 160 officials, 3,411 soldiers and 5,000 of their wives and children. This garrison represented a fifth of Harar's entire population, and the soldiers were usually quartered among the local populace. The imposition of substantial taxes in Harar incited protests from the Harari people against the Egyptian occupation, prompting British administrator [[Charles George Gordon]] to intervene in 1878 to remove Governor Rauf Pasha from his position.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hake |first1=Alfred |title=The Story of Chinese Gordon With Additions, Bringing Down the Narrative to the Present Time |publisher=Worthington |page=258 |url=https://www.google.ca/books/edition/The_Story_of_Chinese_Gordon/5Lk4AQAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=raouf+pasha+tyrant+harrar&pg=PA258&printsec=frontcover}}</ref> Researcher Alice Moore-Harell indicates that before Gordon's arrival, the atmosphere had grown strained, with certain Egyptian soldiers aligning themselves with the local populace and declining to follow the governor's directives.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Moore-Harell |first1=Alice |title=Gordon and the Sudan Prologue to the Mahdiyya 1877-1880 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |url=https://www.google.ca/books/edition/Gordon_and_the_Sudan/jZC0AQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=At+the+beginning+of+1878+the+people+of+Harar+resisted+when+the+governor,+Muhammad+Ra%E2%80%99uf+Pasha,+demanded+an+advance+on+their+annual+quota+of+taxes,+and+despite+many+protests+refused+to+withdraw+his+order&pg=PT202&printsec=frontcover}}</ref>

The Egyptian period witnessed the reconstruction and enlargement of the city's infrastructure. Under the governor Nadi Pasha, the height of the walls were increased. The old palace of the Emirs was demolished and erected in its place was a two-story governor's house which looked over the marketplace and dominated the entire settlement. The town's main mosque was also torn down and replaced with a somewhat larger structure. The Egyptians also built a much needed hospital near the south western gate under Ridwan Pasha. During the period of Egyptian rule, [[Arthur Rimbaud]] lived in the city as the local functionary of several different commercial companies based in [[Aden]]; he returned in 1888 to resume trading in coffee, [[musk]], and skins until a fatal disease forced him to return to France. A house said to have been his residence is now a museum.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Munro-Hay |first=Stuart |year=2002 |title=Ethiopia, the Unknown Land: A Cultural and Historical Guide |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |page=184 |isbn=978-1-86064-744-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NWNTfztz5KoC&pg=PA184}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Uhlig |first1=Siegbert |title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha |date=2003 |pages=1019}}</ref>

The Egyptian occupation of Harar came to an end as a result of the [[Anglo-Egyptian War|British conquest of Egypt]] and the [[Mahdist War|Mahdist revolt]]. These developments produced a crisis in 1884 when the Egyptian government's payments to the troops ceased to arrive, the garrison was forced to raid the Oromos and Somalis for food. In accordance with an agreement with another power in the region namely France, the UK was forced to withdraw its Egyptian forces from Harar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Blundell |first1=Herbert |title=A Journey through Abyssinia to the Nile |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |page=101 |url=https://everythingharar.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1900Expedition.pdf}}</ref> The Egyptian troops duly moved out of the city, taking some valuables with them, but leaving most of their local families behind. The Emirate was thus restored under [['Abd Allah II ibn 'Ali 'Abd ash-Shakur|Emir Abdullahi]] in 1885, however Emir Abdullahi's rule was short lived for in 1887 [[Menelik II]] would defeat him at the [[Battle of Chelenqo]] and thus conquer the walled city.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Uhlig |first1=Siegbert |title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha |date=2003 |pages=1019}}</ref>

===Abyssinian rule (1887–1936)===
In 1887, the army of [[Menelik II]] would conquer Harar after defeating Emir Abdullahi's troops at Chelenqo, then appointed his nephew [[Ras Makonnen]] as governor of the region. According to Jules Borelli, after Menelik's departure many of the Shewan troops quartered in the city were said to have looted the silos in which the inhabitants had stored their grain. Some of those robbed appealed to Makonnen, who promised restitution, but Borelli believes they never received any. Makonnen had ordered the primary mosque of Harar torn down and replaced it with an Orthodox Church designed by an Italian architect.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jonas · |first1=Raymond |title=The Battle of Adwa African Victory in the Age of Empire |date=29 November 2011 |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=76 |isbn=978-0-674-06279-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9p_8XB-OeMMC&dq=makonnen+had+the+main+mosque+torn+down&pg=PA76}}</ref> The French traveler Charles Michel notes that "the first years of the Abyssinian occupation were far from prosperous" as "the Abyssinian chiefs took for themselves what could have any value", while "the soldiers, several thousand in number, chased the [[Harari people|Hararis]] from their dwellings to install themselves in their place, and devastated everything around them." Traders were driven away and markets becoming impossible in towns were held instead in the remote countryside.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Borelli |first1=Jules |title=Éthiopie méridionale journal de mon voyage aux pays Amhara, Oromo et Sidama, septembre 1885 à novembre 1888 |year=1890 |publisher=Quantin, Librairies-imprimeries réunies |pages=238–239 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3AkaAQAAMAAJ&dq=harrar+le+roi+avait+etabli+son+camp+pres+de+la+ville&pg=PA238}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Pankhurst |first=Richard |year=1982 |title=History of Ethiopian towns from the mid 19th century to 1935 |page=255 |publisher=Steiner }}</ref>

Harar lost some of its commercial importance with the creation of the French-built [[Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway]], initially intended to run via the city but diverted north of the mountains between Harar and the [[Awash River]] to save money. As a result of this, [[Dire Dawa]] was founded in 1902 as ''New Harar''. The British planned to revitalise the historic Harar-Berbera trade route by connecting the two cities via rail as a means to bolster trade. However, the initiative was vetoed by parliament on the grounds that it would harm the [[Entente Cordiale]] between France and Britain.<ref>{{cite report|title=Berbera-Harrar Railway Survey Vol. 1 |url= http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C1915675}}</ref>

Unlike with most other subjugated lands in the south, Harar's pre-conquest government employed literacy as a tool of governance. Therefore Ras Makonnen did not attempt to destroy them, but choose to inherit the long established administrative structures and official archives. The retention of historically developed administrative structure was an attempt to govern the province as inexpensively as possible. Nevertheless, with the arrival of settlers from [[Shewa]] into the region social tensions ensured, especially when Harar became to be regarded as the support base for [[Lij Iyasu]]. By the 1920s, the previously dominate position held by Hararis was beginning to be replaced by Christian immigrants, who extended their land holdings in the city by granting the Hararis large and unpayable loans. To stem the tide of land confiscations, a group of Harari elites established a group called the ''firmac''. The goal of the ''firmac'' was to protect Harari property and maintain ethnic unity by discouraging un-Islamic practices. They also opened the first Islamic school in Harar that taught modern subjects.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Uhlig |first1=Siegbert |title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha |date=2003 |pages=1020}}</ref>

===Italian occupation and aftermath (1936–1948)===
[[File:Coat of arms of Harrar Governorate.png|thumb|right|200px|Harar province coat of arms during Italian rule]]
On 22 March, the ''Regia Aeronautica'' bombed Harar and [[Jijiga]] even though Harar had been declared an "[[open city]]". Harar was captured by the [[29th Infantry Division "Piemonte"]] on 8 May 1936 under Marshall [[Rodolfo Graziani]] during the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]]. The Italian invasion of Ethiopia was generally welcomed by Harar, who had grown to resent the Christian Amhara rule, the Italian policy of pitting different ethnic and religious groups had resonated with the Hararis. Under the Italians, mosques were built, the use of Arabic was encouraged, Hararis and other Muslim collaborators were hired by the Italian administration and previously confiscated land was returned to their original owners and descendants. Harar would serve as the capital of [[Harar Governorate]], one of the Italian governors of Harar was [[Enrico Cerulli]] (1939–1940).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Uhlig |first1=Siegbert |title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha |date=2003 |pages=1020}}</ref>

During the [[East African campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]], Italian rule would almost immediately disintegrate and Harar was captured by the 1st battalion of the [[Nigeria Regiment]], advancing from [[Jijiga]] by way of the [[Marda Pass]] on 29 March 1941. The freedom granted to Harar by the Italians was not quickly forgotten, especially after Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] attempted to restore the political and economic power of the [[Shewa]]n elites. When the [[Somali Youth League]] (SYL) began agitating Harari members, they started their own branch known as ''Kulubi''. The Ethiopian government immediately cracked down on this movement, arresting suspected members, confiscating property and imposing travel restrictions. This had a significant affect as for the first time in history, Hararis began migrating out of the city in large numbers, mainly to [[Dire Dawa]] and [[Addis Ababa]], but also eventually abroad to [[Europe]] and [[North America]], creating a large Harari diaspora.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Uhlig |first1=Siegbert |title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha |date=2003 |pages=1020}}</ref>

===Present (1948–)===
[[File:The Harari Cultural House (Gey Gar) ጌይ ጋር.jpg|thumb|The Harari Cultural House (Gey Gar)]]
Following the aftermath of [[World War II]], the city saw the construction of a high school and a military academy. With the rise of the [[Derg]] in the 1970s, Harari disatsifcation remained high, Derg officials appropriating Harari property and forcibly conscripting Harari youth into the army saw further migration abroad, specifically to [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Uhlig |first1=Siegbert |title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha |date=2003 |pages=1020}}</ref>

After the rise of the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF) in the early 1990s, Hararis were encouraged to use their language in official capacities. Considerable effort was taken to develop Harari as an official educational and administrative language. This saw a general cultural revival in Harar, with also stressed the importance of Islam. The complex social interactions of Sufi rituals at Harar's numerous shrines both refied local Islamic identity and attracted large numbers of Muslim Ethiopian tourists. By 1994, two political parties were vying over power in Harar, one being the [[Harari National League]] (HNL) and the Harari Democratic Unity Party. After a tense competition which occasionally descended into violence, the HNL was able to seize power.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Uhlig |first1=Siegbert |title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha |date=2003 |pages=1020}}</ref>

Tensions persist between the Harari people and the neighboring Oromo community, as the Oromo have taken possession of certain agricultural lands belonging to the Harari in the area surrounding Harar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gebissa |first1=Ezekiel |title=Hararis in Harar Must be Restored and Protected: A Rejoinder to Abdullah Sherif |publisher=ethiopia-insight |url=https://www.ethiopia-insight.com/2024/03/12/hararis-in-harar-must-be-restored-and-protected-a-rejoinder-to-abdullah-sherifs-hararis-in-harar-are-being-erased-and-dispossessed/}}</ref> In 2018, Tom Gardner reported that the [[Qeerroo]] Oromo nationalists took control of the city, demanding millions of [[Ethiopian birr]] as a condition for restoring water supplies to the residents of Harar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gardner |first1=Tom |title=The Abiy Project God, Power and War in the New Ethiopia |publisher=Hurst |page=147 |url=https://www.google.ca/books/edition/The_Abiy_Project/dVnbEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=In+the+eastern+city+of+Harar,+residents+went+without+drinking+water+for+nearly+a+month+after+Qeerroos+in+the+surrounding+hinterland+shut+the+supply+down+and+demanded+a+ransom+of+10+million+birr&pg=PT158&printsec=frontcover}}</ref>

The old walled city of Harar is divided into 5 quarters: Assum Bari, [[Argobba Bari]], Suqutat Bari, [[Badro Bari]], and [[Asmadin Bari]].<ref name="Insoll"/> These quarters are then further divided into neighborhoods called ''toya'', which are often named after a Muslim shrine or a prominent tree serving as a local landmark.<ref name="Insoll"/> According to S.R. Waldron, there were 59 such neighborhoods around 1975.<ref name="Hecht"/>

In the late 1960s, it was still possible to walk around the outside of the city walls on foot; doing so took about an hour.<ref name="Hecht"/> By the early 1980s, though, this was no longer possible because the city had begun to expand out from the walled city, with some buildings being built directly attached to the outside of the wall.<ref name="Hecht"/>

* [[Argobba Bari]] (located in the east)
* Suqutat Bari (located in the south east)
* [[Badro Bari]] (located in the south)
* [[Asmadin Bari]] (located in the west)

Other gates such as the unofficial modern sixth ''"Harar gate"'' was built after the Abyssinian invasion in the 19th century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Raymond |first=André |title=The City in the Islamic World Part 1 |year=2008 |publisher=BRILL |page=629 |isbn=978-9004162402 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nY2DqJNPmioC&dq=harar+gate&pg=PA629}}</ref>

==Houses==
[[File:Harar, casa tradizionale, porta intagliata 01.jpg|thumb|Exterior of a Harari house]]
Known as ''gey gar'' ("city house", plural: ''gey garach''), Harari houses form a distinct archetype that differs from other Muslim regions and from other parts of Ethiopia.<ref name="Abubaker">{{cite book |last=Abubaker |first=Abdulmalik |title=The Relevancy of Harari Values in Self Regulation |year=2016 |publisher=University of Alabama |pages=46–58 |url=https://ir.ua.edu/bitstream/handle/123456789/3201/file_1.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y}}</ref> The traditional Harari house design is still widely in use today, with only minor changes, and Hararis who have moved to other cities try to adhere to a similar style.<ref name="Hecht">{{cite journal |last=Hecht |first=Elisabeth-Dorothea |title=The City of Harar and the Traditional Harar House |journal=Journal of Ethiopian Studies |year=1982 |volume=15 |pages=57–78 |jstor=41965897 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41965897 |access-date=25 August 2021}}</ref> Hararis take great pride in their houses, and they form an important part of Harari culture.<ref name="Abubaker"/>

A walled compound (''abāt'') consists of several residences, which share the same walls but are not interconnected.<ref name="Hecht"/> They are arranged around a courtyard, with most of the windows facing the courtyard instead of the street.<ref name="Hecht"/> Doors to individual residences almost always point east or west; north- or south-facing doors are rare.<ref name="Abubaker"/> According to [[Kabir (teacher)|Kabir]] Abdulmuheimen Abdulnassir, farmers and merchants often have east-facing doors so that they can rise early for work.<ref name="Abubaker"/> The several families who live in the same compound share one or two [[kitchen]]s, which are disconnected from the residences.<ref name="Hecht"/> The walls that surround the compounds are joined so that they are basically continuous.<ref name="Hecht"/> The outer gate facing the street is usually wooden but sometimes iron, and they are either painted or whitewashed.<ref name="Hecht"/> The walls form an [[architrave]] around them.<ref name="Hecht"/>

Sometimes several compounds are joined into a "block" of compounds, all surrounded by the same wall and then having their own walls around them.<ref name="Hecht"/> These "blocks" are set up so that a visitor passes the first compound before reaching the second, etc.<ref name="Hecht"/>

Building materials are local stone, while a mixture of pounded stones and clay are used as both [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and [[plaster]] to cover the walls before they are whitewashed.<ref name="Hecht"/> This is the case in newer houses as well as older ones.<ref name="Hecht"/>

[[File:Inside an Adari house (25313093086).jpg|thumb|Interior of a Harari house]]
The [[floor plan]] of a typical Harari house is rectangular.<ref name="Hecht"/> The main room is the large [[living room]] called the ''gidīr gār'' or the ''gār ēqäd''.<ref name="Hecht"/> The gidīr gār has several raised platforms, called ''nädäba''s, which function as seats or beds.<ref name="Hecht"/> A typical house will have five nädäbas.<ref name="Hecht"/> At the back of the gidir gar, across from the front door, are two nädäbas: the "small" one, or ''tīt nädäba'', and then behind it the "big" one, or ''gidīr nädäba'', which is somewhat higher up.<ref name="Hecht"/> These are the two largest nädäbas.<ref name="Abubaker"/> Shoes may be worn as far as the tīt nädäba, but then they must be removed.<ref name="Hecht"/> The tīt nädäba is where younger people or people with less seniority sit.<ref name="Abubaker"/> Children also sleep on this nädäba.<ref name="Abubaker"/> Historically, at the emir's court, it served as the seat for plaintiffs or defendants.<ref name="Abubaker"/> The gidīr nädäba seats elders and people who are considered more senior.<ref name="Abubaker"/> Historically, at the emir's court, dignitaries were seated here.<ref name="Abubaker"/> When a person dies, their body is kept on the gidīr nädäba before being buried as a sign of respect.<ref name="Abubaker"/> A basin is dug in the gidīr nädäba and filled with water and used to wash the body, and then the basin is filled in again.<ref name="Abubaker"/>

The ''amīr nädäba'', or nädäba of honor, is reserved for the master of the house and for honored guests; it can be on either the left or the right depending on the house.<ref name="Hecht"/> It is positioned so that the head of the family can see whoever enters the home and act accordingly.<ref name="Abubaker"/> The "hidden" nädäba, or the ''sutri nädäba'', can also be on either side but is always behind a protruding pillar or ''maxazu''.<ref name="Hecht"/> Historically, this is known as the "[[malassay]] nädäba" because the guards of the emir would sit here during meetings or court cases.<ref name="Abubaker"/> The sutri nädäba is used for sleeping.<ref name="Hecht"/> It is also used as a seat where the husband rests when he comes home.<ref name="Abubaker"/> Finally, there is the ''gäbti äḥer näbäda'', or the one behind the entrance door.<ref name="Hecht"/> Like the amīr and sutri nädäbas, this one can be on either the left or the right.<ref name="Hecht"/> At the back corners there are sometimes built-in cupboards or wardrobes called ''näbäda dēra''s.<ref name="Hecht"/> Cash<ref name="Abubaker"/> and important documents are kept in a chest in the näbäda dēra.<ref name="Hecht"/> The upper part of the näbäda dēra is used to store clothes belonging to the master of the house.<ref name="Abubaker"/>

[[File:Interior, Traditional Harari Home (2775764645).jpg|thumb|Wall niches in a Harari home]]
The gidīr gār has built-in niches called ''ṭāqēt''s which are used to store and display personal possessions.<ref name="Hecht"/><ref name="Insoll"/> They are fairly high up and there are typically 11 of them: five on the main wall opposite the door, and the rest on the other walls.<ref name="Hecht"/> The two rectangular niches in the middle of the main wall (called ''ēqäd ṭāqēt'') are typically used to store books, especially the [[Qur'an]].<ref name="Hecht"/> Their rectangular shape is supposed to be evocative of death and the grave.<ref name="Hecht"/> In addition to the 11 main niches, there are sometimes also niches in the nädäbas, which are used to hold shoes or an [[incense burner]].<ref name="Hecht"/>

[[File:Bride chamber (24712553173).jpg|thumb|Stairway to the qala on the left, with the kirtät in the background]]
On either side of the entrance there is an open doorway leading to the ''kirtät'', which is a side room with a low ceiling and its own nädäba.<ref name="Hecht"/> The wall between the kirtät and the gidīr gār sometimes has a window screen with decorative woodcarving.<ref name="Hecht"/> Women usually stay in the kirtät when men have a [[bärça]] (a meeting to chew [[khat]] and meditate).<ref name="Hecht"/> In the past, the kirtät was also where a young bride would live in seclusion for 8 months after her wedding.<ref name="Hecht"/> In that case the entryway to the kirtät, which does not otherwise have a door, would be covered with a [[bamboo]] screen and a curtain.<ref name="Hecht"/>

A second side room with a low ceiling, the ''dēra'', is connected to the kirtät by a small door.<ref name="Hecht"/> It is used to store items which are not susceptible to attack by [[rat]]s.<ref name="Hecht"/> Next to the door, the wall of the dēra has a special niche where the ''aflāla''s are kept.<ref name="Hecht"/> These are black pottery containers with long necks and covered by elongated basketry lids called ''aflāla uffa''s.<ref name="Hecht"/> They are used to store the family's [[jewelry]] and other valuables, as well as the [[umbilical cord]]s of the family's children.<ref name="Hecht"/> According to Fethia Ahmed, curator of the Harari cultural museum, the lids being turned upside down indicates that the husband has died and that there is a widow living in the house.<ref name="Abubaker"/>

The dēra is a private space, where a husband and wife may speak without their children listening.<ref name="Abubaker"/> It is also used by children between the ages of 3 and 7 to eat during Ramadan out of public view, before they begin to fast all day long at age 7.<ref name="Abubaker"/> The dēra is built with porous stone without cement to allow for better ventilation.<ref name="Abubaker"/>

The ceiling above the gidīr gār rises to the full height of the house.<ref name="Hecht"/> Above the side rooms, though, there is an upper level called the ''qala''.<ref name="Hecht"/> Originally, the qala was used mainly for storage and sometimes as a sleeping area, and it was not separated from the gidīr gār in any way.<ref name="Hecht"/> Since the late 19th century, though, there is usually a wooden screen separating the two, and the qala has basically become a distinct second floor, often with several rooms, although without nädäbas or other installations.<ref name="Hecht"/> The staircase to the qala usually consists of six to nine steps.<ref name="Hecht"/> In newer houses it has a carved wood [[banister]] but in older houses it did not.<ref name="Hecht"/>

House ceilings are traditionally made of thin tree trunks which have had their bark stripped off.<ref name="Hecht"/> Today the ceiling is whitewashed along with the rest of the house.<ref name="Hecht"/> One beam, located above the edge of the tīt nädäba, is called the ''ḥāmil''; today it is used to hang a neon lamp from, but in the past people would hang an [[ostrich egg]] from it because it was believed that doing so would protect the house from lightning.<ref name="Hecht"/> Nowadays, the ceilings are made of varnished wooden planks, with the ''ḥāmil'' distinguished by its larger size and distinct shape.<ref name="Hecht"/>

Floors are traditionally made of red earth (called ''qēḥ afär''), and the parts of nädäbas that aren't covered by rugs or mats are also painted red.<ref name="Hecht"/> Today they are often tiled, usually with at least some red present.<ref name="Hecht"/> The red is supposed to be reminiscent of the blood shed at the [[Battle of Chelenqo]].<ref name="Hecht"/>

Some houses will have an adjoining ''tīt gār'' or "small house", which has a separate entrance and a nädäba of its own.<ref name="Hecht"/> The tīt gār is often unconnected to the main house.<ref name="Hecht"/> It is used by younger family members, or sometimes rented to tenants.<ref name="Hecht"/> Since the 20th century, some houses add another level above the tīt gār and connect it to the qala as well as giving it a separate entrance via a staircase on the outside of the house.<ref name="Hecht"/>

Each compound typically contained a separate room for a farmhand or servant, without nädäbas or side rooms.<ref name="Hecht"/> There would also be stables for cows and donkeys.<ref name="Hecht"/> There are also typically one or two "kitchen houses", unconnected to the houses, typically located on either sides of the courtyard.<ref name="Hecht"/> These kitchens have no windows, with smoke escaping through the door, so eventually the walls end up covered in soot.<ref name="Hecht"/> Shelves made from tree trunks are used to store kitchen utensils.<ref name="Hecht"/>

In the past, Harari houses would have little to no furniture.<ref name="Hecht"/> Since the 20th century, simple Western-style wooden chairs have proliferated, as well as metal bedsteads with kapok mattresses which are set up on the sutri nädäba.<ref name="Hecht"/>

[[Richard Francis Burton]] described the emir's home as the only building whose exterior was whitewashed, implying that most buildings were undecorated at the time of his visit in the 1800s.<ref name="Hecht"/> Most houses were similarly described as neither painted nor whitewashed as late as 1935.<ref name="Hecht"/> Today, though, Hararis typically whitewash their houses with a [[limestone]] mixture (called ''näçih afär'') at least once and ideally twice a year, once before [[Ramadan]] and once again before the [[Aräfa]] festival.<ref name="Hecht"/> Household items and baskets are thoroughly cleaned at the same time.<ref name="Hecht"/> Today, instead of whitewashing, walls are sometimes painted using [[oil paint]]s.<ref name="Hecht"/> This can be any color, although green is the most popular.<ref name="Hecht"/>

[[File:Harar, casa tradizionale (anisa) 00.jpg|thumb|Hall in a traditional Harari house]]
[[Interior decorating]] of homes is typically done by women.<ref name="Hecht"/> They cover the nädäbas with rugs, mats, and pillows, and decorate the walls with Harari basketry (which is also typically made by women).<ref name="Hecht"/> Enamel plates and bowls are also hung on the walls today.<ref name="Hecht"/> Decorative baskets are generally hung up symmetrically and in pairs.<ref name="Hecht"/> Each household has its own style of decoration, and women guests often comment on how they like how the host's house is decorated.<ref name="Hecht"/> There is a stereotype that younger women are more fastidious at decorating their homes than older women, and that younger couples reapply the red earth to the floors once a week while older ones only do it a few times a year.<ref name="Hecht"/>

The largest type of decorative baskets are the kind that are used to serve bread and sweets at women's gatherings.<ref name="Hecht"/> These have tall conical lids that are hung above and overlapping them.<ref name="Hecht"/> They are hung in one or two rows on the wall behind the gidīr nädäba and below the niches, and they are typically in alternating pairs.<ref name="Hecht"/> Between the ''ēqäd ṭāqēt''s, the two rectangular niches in the center used for storing books, there is a vertical line of small basketry plates called ''sāgāri''s along with their lids.<ref name="Hecht"/> These are used to serve coffee beans at wedding or funeral feasts.<ref name="Hecht"/> They are typically in a group of 3, with 2 of them sharing a pattern and design.<ref name="Hecht"/> Next to the amīr nädäba and the dēra, the wall is decorated with other basketry plates in pairs.<ref name="Hecht"/> These are about the size of a breakfast plate and traditionally are used to serve bread.<ref name="Hecht"/> Two of them are called "the baskets for the [[mother-in-law]]", or the ''ḥamāt mot'', and these are presented by the family of a bride to the in-laws at a wedding.<ref name="Hecht"/>

Emigrants from Harar often try to stick to the traditional Harari home layout when possible, even in buildings with different architectural styles.<ref name="Hecht"/> There will be some sort of gidīr gār indicated, with rugs and pillows forming an informal nädäba, and the walls will be decorated with traditional Harari basketry.<ref name="Hecht"/>

===Authenticity===
Harar Jugol is a rare example of a relatively well preserved historic town that has retained its traditions, urban fabric, and rich Harari Muslim cultural heritage to the present time. It is one of the holy towns of Islam in Africa, and the capital of a minority region within Christian Ethiopia. The historic city is physically limited and well defined by its 16th-century surrounding wall and the setting has been retained along the eastern and south-eastern sides of the property. However, inappropriate interventions, such as plastering the houses, changing doors from wood to metal, the introduction of non-traditional materials and visual impacts such as TV antennas have been gradually affecting the authenticity of the historic fabric.
