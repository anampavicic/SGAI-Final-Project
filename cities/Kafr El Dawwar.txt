Located approximately 30&nbsp;km from [[Alexandria]], the municipality has a population of about 265,300 inhabitants<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.populstat.info/Africa/egyptt.htm |title=EGYPT: urban population |website=www.populstat.info |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501045020/http://www.populstat.info/Africa/egyptt.htm |archive-date=2007-05-01}}</ref> and comprises a number of smaller towns and villages.

==History==
{{main|Battle of Tel El Kebir|Battle of Kafr El Dawwar}}

Kafr El Dawwar was the location of the famous [[Battle of Kafr El Dawwar]] between the Egyptian army, headed by [[Ahmed Orabi]], and the British army, during the [[Anglo-Egyptian War]] of 1882. For five weeks, Orabi was able to stop British forces from advancing toward the Egyptian capital of [[Cairo]]. Egyptian victory in the battle compelled the British to change their strategy, with British forces shifting to the [[Suez Canal]] to reach Cairo through Tel El Kebir.

In the early months of the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]], Kafr El Dawwar was the scene of industrial action that resulted in death sentences for two leaders of the strike.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Munir: Nasser's Egypt (Summer 1961)|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/1961/no005/munir.htm|access-date=2021-09-22|website=www.marxists.org}}</ref>

In September 1984, protests broke out in Kafr El Dawwar over efforts by [[Hosni Mubarak]], Egypt's [[President of Egypt|President]], to raise [[food prices]] during a period of wage decreases. Thousands of demonstrators threw rocks, and occupied markets and roads. In response, security forces fired rubber bullets and tear gas, killing three persons at a milling plant, and injuring dozens more.<ref name=wp1>{{cite news|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=2 October 1984|first=David|last=Ottaway|title=Mubarak Orders Price Rollbacks To Quell Violence Near Alexandria}}</ref> Rioting spread to other centres, including the [[Misr Spinning and Weaving Company]] in El-Mahalla.<ref name=wp1 />
