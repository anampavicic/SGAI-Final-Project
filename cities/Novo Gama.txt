==History==
Novo Gama first appeared in 1974, with the housing development called Parque Estrela D'Alva VI.  The population increased due to the great migratory influx, mainly from the Northeast and Goiás.  Because of the rocky soil the place was popularly known as Pedregal. The region was then part of the municipality of [[Luziânia]].

The project of the creation of Núcleo Habitacional Novo Gama arose from popular movements associated with the famous open-air market of Pedregal.  The Núcleo Habitacional Novo Gama was created in t1980, by a real estate group called Economisa.  With the fast population growth Luziânia recognized the necessity of dividing the space in districts, and the place was called district of Novo Gama. In 1995 it became independent of [[Luziânia]].
