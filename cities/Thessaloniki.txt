The city was founded in 315&nbsp;BC by [[Cassander|Cassander of Macedon]], who named it after his wife [[Thessalonike of Macedon|Thessalonike]], daughter of [[Philip II of Macedon]] and sister of [[Alexander the Great]].

An important metropolis by the Roman period, Thessaloniki was the second largest and wealthiest city of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. It [[Siege of Thessalonica (1422–1430)|was conquered by the Ottomans]] in 1430 and remained an important seaport and multi-ethnic metropolis during the nearly five centuries of [[Ottoman Greece|Turkish rule]], with churches, mosques, and synagogues co-existing side by side. From the 16th to the 20th century it was the only [[History of the Jews in Thessaloniki|Jewish-majority city in Europe]].

In English, the city can be called Thessaloniki, Salonika, Thessalonica, Salonica, Thessalonika, Saloniki, Thessalonike, or Thessalonice. In printed texts, the most common name and spelling until the early 20th century was Thessalonica, matching the Latin name; through most of rest of the 20th century, it was Salonika. By about 1985, the most common single name became Thessaloniki.<ref>Google nGrams [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Saloniki%2CThessaloniki%2CThessalonica%2CThessalonika%2CSalonica%2CSalonika%2CThessalonike%2CSalonike%2CThessalonice&year_start=1800&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=10&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2CSaloniki%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CThessaloniki%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CThessalonica%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CThessalonika%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CSalonica%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CSalonika%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CThessalonike%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CSalonike%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CThessalonice%3B%2Cc0#t1%3B%2CSaloniki%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CThessaloniki%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CThessalonica%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CThessalonika%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CSalonica%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CSalonika%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CThessalonike%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CSalonike%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CThessalonice%3B%2Cc0 graph] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240315023017/https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Saloniki%2CThessaloniki%2CThessalonica%2CThessalonika%2CSalonica%2CSalonika%2CThessalonike%2CSalonike%2CThessalonice&year_start=1800&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=10&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2CSaloniki%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CThessaloniki%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CThessalonica%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CThessalonika%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CSalonica%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CSalonika%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CThessalonike%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CSalonike%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CThessalonice%3B%2Cc0#t1%3B%2CSaloniki%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CThessaloniki%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CThessalonica%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CThessalonika%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CSalonica%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CSalonika%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CThessalonike%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CSalonike%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CThessalonice%3B%2Cc0 |date=15 March 2024 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Thessaloniki%2BThessalonica%2BThessalonika%2BThessalonike%2BThessalonice%2CSaloniki%2BSalonica%2BSalonika%2BSalonike%2BSalonice&year_start=1800&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=10&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2C%28Thessaloniki%20%2B%20Thessalonica%20%2B%20Thessalonika%20%2B%20Thessalonike%20%2B%20Thessalonice%29%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2C%28Saloniki%20%2B%20Salonica%20%2B%20Salonika%20%2B%20Salonike%20%2B%20Salonice%29%3B%2Cc0#t1%3B%2C(Thessaloniki%20%2B%20Thessalonica%20%2B%20Thessalonika%20%2B%20Thessalonike%20%2B%20Thessalonice)%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2C(Saloniki%20%2B%20Salonica%20%2B%20Salonika%20%2B%20Salonike%20%2B%20Salonice)%3B%2Cc0 |title=Google nGrams |access-date=7 June 2020 |archive-date=15 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240315023018/https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Thessaloniki%2BThessalonica%2BThessalonika%2BThessalonike%2BThessalonice%2CSaloniki%2BSalonica%2BSalonika%2BSalonike%2BSalonice&year_start=1800&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=10&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2C%28Thessaloniki%20%2B%20Thessalonica%20%2B%20Thessalonika%20%2B%20Thessalonike%20%2B%20Thessalonice%29%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2C%28Saloniki%20%2B%20Salonica%20%2B%20Salonika%20%2B%20Salonike%20%2B%20Salonice%29%3B%2Cc0#t1%3B%2C(Thessaloniki%20%2B%20Thessalonica%20%2B%20Thessalonika%20%2B%20Thessalonike%20%2B%20Thessalonice)%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2C(Saloniki%20%2B%20Salonica%20%2B%20Salonika%20%2B%20Salonike%20%2B%20Salonice)%3B%2Cc0 |url-status=live }}</ref> The forms with the Latin ending ''-a'' taken together remain more common than those with the phonetic Greek ending ''-i'' and much more common than the ancient transliteration ''-e''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Saloniki%2BThessaloniki%2CThessalonica%2BThessalonika%2BSalonica%2BSalonika%2CSalonike%2BThessalonike%2BThessalonice%2BSalonice&year_start=1800&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=10&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2C%28Saloniki%20%2B%20Thessaloniki%29%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2C%28Thessalonica%20%2B%20Thessalonika%20%2B%20Salonica%20%2B%20Salonika%29%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2C%28Salonike%20%2B%20Thessalonike%20%2B%20Thessalonice%20%2B%20Salonice%29%3B%2Cc0 |title=Google nGrams |access-date=7 June 2020 |archive-date=15 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240315023032/https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Saloniki%2BThessaloniki%2CThessalonica%2BThessalonika%2BSalonica%2BSalonika%2CSalonike%2BThessalonike%2BThessalonice%2BSalonice&year_start=1800&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=10&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2C%28Saloniki%20%2B%20Thessaloniki%29%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2C%28Thessalonica%20%2B%20Thessalonika%20%2B%20Salonica%20%2B%20Salonika%29%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2C%28Salonike%20%2B%20Thessalonike%20%2B%20Thessalonice%20%2B%20Salonice%29%3B%2Cc0 |url-status=live }}</ref>

At the time of the Roman Empire, about 50 AD, Thessaloniki was also one of the [[early centres of Christianity]]; while on his second missionary journey, [[Paul the Apostle]] visited this city's chief synagogue on three Sabbaths and sowed the seeds for Thessaloniki's first Christian church. Later, Paul wrote letters to the new church at Thessaloniki, with two letters to the church under his name appearing in the [[Biblical canon]] as [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians|First]] and [[Second Epistle to the Thessalonians|Second Thessalonians]].

The [[Fall of Gallipoli|capture]] of [[Gelibolu|Gallipoli]] by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1354 kicked off a rapid Turkish expansion in the southern [[Balkans]], conducted both by the Ottomans themselves and by semi-independent Turkish [[ghazi (warrior)|ghazi]] warrior-bands. By 1369, the Ottomans were able to [[Ottoman conquest of Adrianople|conquer Adrianople]] (modern [[Edirne]]), which became their new capital until [[Fall of Constantinople|1453]].{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=377–378, 406}} Thessalonica, ruled by [[Manuel II Palaiologos]] (r. 1391–1425) itself surrendered after a [[Siege of Thessalonica (1383–1387)|lengthy siege in 1383–1387]], along with most of eastern and central Macedonia, to the forces of Sultan [[Murad I]].{{sfn|Vacalopoulos|1973|pp=59–64}} Initially, the surrendered cities were allowed complete autonomy in exchange for payment of the ''[[kharaj]]'' [[poll-tax]]. Following the death of Emperor [[John V Palaiologos]] in 1391, however, Manuel II escaped Ottoman custody and went to Constantinople, where he was crowned emperor, succeeding his father. This angered Sultan [[Bayezid I]], who laid waste to the remaining Byzantine territories, and then turned on Chrysopolis, which was captured by storm and largely destroyed.{{sfn|Vacalopoulos|1973|pp=64–65}} Thessalonica too submitted again to Ottoman rule at this time, possibly after brief resistance, but was treated more leniently: although the city was brought under full Ottoman control, the Christian population and the Church retained most of their possessions, and the city retained its institutions.{{sfn|Vacalopoulos|1973|pp=65–67}}{{sfn|Necipoğlu|2009|pp=30, 84–99}}

[[File:Meister der Demetrius-Kirche in Saloniki 001.jpg|alt=|right|180px|thumb|A mosaic of [[Saint George]] in [[Hagios Demetrios|Saint Demetrios Church]]]]

Thessalonica remained in Ottoman hands until 1403, when Emperor Manuel II sided with Bayezid's eldest son [[Süleyman Çelebi|Süleyman]] in the [[Ottoman Interregnum|Ottoman succession struggle]] that broke out following the crushing defeat and capture of Bayezid at the [[Battle of Ankara]] against [[Tamerlane]] in 1402. In exchange for his support, in the [[Treaty of Gallipoli]] the Byzantine emperor secured the return of Thessalonica, part of its hinterland, the [[Chalcidice]] peninsula, and the coastal region between the rivers [[Strymon River|Strymon]] and [[Pineios (Thessaly)|Pineios]].{{sfn|Vacalopoulos|1973|pp=67, 75}}{{sfn|Bryer|1998|pp=777–778}} Thessalonica and the surrounding region were given as an autonomous [[appanage]] to [[John VII Palaiologos]]. After his death in 1408, he was succeeded by Manuel's third son, the [[Despot (court title)|Despot]] [[Andronikos Palaiologos (son of Manuel II)|Andronikos Palaiologos]], who was supervised by [[Demetrios Leontares]] until 1415. Thessalonica enjoyed a period of relative peace and prosperity after 1403, as the Turks were preoccupied with [[Ottoman Interregnum|their own civil war]], but was attacked by the rival Ottoman pretenders in 1412 (by [[Musa Çelebi]]{{sfn|Magoulias|1975|p=108}}) and 1416 (during the uprising of [[Mustafa Çelebi]] against [[Mehmed I]]{{sfn|Magoulias|1975|pp=123–125}}).{{sfn|Vacalopoulos|1973|pp=76–77}}{{sfn|Necipoğlu|2009|pp=39, 44, 47}} Once the Ottoman civil war ended, the Turkish pressure on the city began to increase again. Just as during the 1383–1387 siege, this led to a sharp division of opinion within the city between factions supporting resistance, if necessary with Western help, or submission to the Ottomans.{{sfn|Necipoğlu|2009|pp=46–47}}

In 1423, Despot Andronikos Palaiologos ceded it to the [[Republic of Venice]] with the hope that it could be protected from the Ottomans who were [[Siege of Thessalonica (1422–1430)|besieging the city]]. The Venetians held Thessaloniki until it was captured by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Murad II]] on 29 March 1430.<ref>''The Roman Orthodox World (1393–1492)'', Anthony Bryer, "The Cambridge History of the Byzantine Empire c.500–1492", ed.

==Geography==
Thessaloniki is located 502 kilometres (312&nbsp;mi) north of [[Athens]].

Thessaloniki's urban area spreads over 30 kilometres (19&nbsp;mi) from [[Oraiokastro]] in the north to [[Thermi]] in the south in the direction of [[Chalkidiki]].

===Geology===

Thessaloniki lies on the northern fringe of the [[Thermaic Gulf]] on its eastern coast and is bound by [[Mount Chortiatis]] on its southeast. Its proximity to imposing [[mountain]] ranges, hills and fault lines, especially towards its southeast have historically made the city prone to geological changes.

Since medieval times, Thessaloniki has been hit by strong [[earthquake]]s, notably in 1759, 1902, 1978 and 1995.<ref name="Thessaloniki earthquakes">{{cite web |url=https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazel/view/hazards/earthquake/event-data?locInclude=Thessaloniki |title=5 Significant Earthquakes where Location Name includes Thessaloniki |last=National Geophysical Data Center / World Data Service (NGDC/WDS): NCEI/WDS Global Significant Earthquake Database.

===Climate===

Thessaloniki's climate is transitional, lying on the periphery of multiple climate zones. According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], the city generally has a [[cold semi-arid climate]] (''BSk'') while a [[hot semi-arid climate]] (''BSh'') is found in the center. [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] (''Csa'') and [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] (''Cfa'') influences are also found in the city's climate.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Climatic Data by City, HNMS, Hellenic National Meteorological Service |url=http://www.emy.gr/emy/en/climatology/climatology_city?perifereia=Central%20Macedonia&poli=Thessaloniki_Mikra |access-date=25 April 2023 |website=www.emy.gr |archive-date=25 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230425000117/http://www.emy.gr/emy/en/climatology/climatology_city?perifereia=Central%20Macedonia&poli=Thessaloniki_Mikra |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=meteothes.gr Live! - Yearly Data |url=https://mail.meteothes.gr/noaa-yearly.php |access-date=25 April 2023 |website=mail.meteothes.gr |archive-date=25 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230425000117/https://mail.meteothes.gr/noaa-yearly.php |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Pindus]] mountain range greatly contributes to the generally dry climate of the area by substantially drying the westerly winds.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mountain Weather in Greece : Articles : SummitPost |url=https://www.summitpost.org/mountain-weather-in-greece/1002640#chapter_11 |access-date=13 June 2023 |website=www.summitpost.org |archive-date=13 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230613210103/https://www.summitpost.org/mountain-weather-in-greece/1002640#chapter_11 |url-status=live }}</ref> In fact, the [[Thessaloniki International Fair]] station of the [[National Observatory of Athens]] is the northernmost station in the world with a [[hot semi-arid climate]] (''BSh''). <ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.anexartitos.gr/serres-emy-neo-rekor-mesi-megistis-thermokrasias-kalokairioy | title=Summer 2024 | accessdate=2 September 2024}}</ref>

[[File:ThessaloniqueHébrard.PNG|thumb|Plan for central Thessaloniki by [[Ernest Hébrard]]. Much of the plan can be seen in today's city centre.]]

===Architecture===
Architecture in Thessaloniki is the direct result of the city's position at the centre of all historical developments in the Balkans. Aside from its commercial importance, Thessaloniki was also for many centuries the military and administrative hub of the region, and beyond this the transportation link between Europe and [[the Levant]]. Merchants, traders and refugees from all over Europe settled in the city. The need for commercial and public buildings in this new era of prosperity led to the construction of large edifices in the city centre. During this time, the city saw the building of banks, large hotels, theatres, warehouses, and factories. Architects who designed some of the most notable buildings of the city, in the late 19th and early 20th century, include [[Vitaliano Poselli]], [[Pietro Arrigoni]], [[Xenophon Paionidis]], [[Salvatore Poselli]], [[:el:Λεονάρντο Τζενάρι|Leonardo Gennari]], [[Eli Modiano]], [[Moshé Jacques]], [[:fr:Joseph Pleyber|Joseph Pleyber]], [[Frederic Charnot]], [[Ernst Ziller]], [[:el:Μαξιμιλιανός Ρούμπενς|Max Rubens]], [[:el:Φιλήμων Παιονίδης|Filimon Paionidis]], [[Dimitris Andronikos]], [[Levi Ernst]], [[Angelos Siagas]], [[Alexandros Tzonis]] and more, using mainly the styles of [[Eclecticism]], [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neobaroque]].

The city layout changed after 1870, when the seaside fortifications gave way to extensive piers, and many of the oldest walls of the city were demolished, including those surrounding the [[White Tower of Thessaloniki|White Tower]], which today stands as the main landmark of the city. As parts of the early Byzantine walls were demolished, this allowed the city to expand east and west along the coast.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thessaloniki.gr/portal/page/portal/DioikitikesYpiresies/PolitistikesYpiresies/DnsiBibliothikwn/TmimaKentrIstorias/PeripatoiKlironomiassthThessaloniki/Thessaloniki.pdf |title=thessaloniki.gr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113204658/http://www.thessaloniki.gr/portal/page/portal/DioikitikesYpiresies/PolitistikesYpiresies/DnsiBibliothikwn/TmimaKentrIstorias/PeripatoiKlironomiassthThessaloniki/Thessaloniki.pdf |archive-date=13 January 2012 }}</ref>

The expansion of [[Eleftherias Square]] towards the sea completed the new commercial hub of the city and at the time was considered one of the most vibrant squares of the city. As the city grew, workers moved to the western districts, because of their proximity to factories and industrial activities; while the middle and [[Social class|upper classes]] gradually moved from the city-centre to the eastern suburbs, leaving mainly businesses. In 1917, a devastating fire swept through the city and burned uncontrollably for 32 hours.<ref name=Gerolympos>Gerolympos, Alexandra Karadimou. ''The Redesign of Thessaloniki after the Fire of 1917''. University Studio Press, Thessaloniki, 1995</ref> It destroyed the city's historic centre and a large part of its architectural heritage, but paved the way for modern development featuring wider diagonal avenues and monumental squares.<ref name=Gerolympos/><ref name=Gerolympos2>{{cite book |last=Karadimou-Gerolympou |first=Alexandra |title=Urban transformation in the Balkans (1820–1920): Aspects of Balkan town planning and the remaking of Thessaloniki |publisher=University Studio Press |year=1996 |isbn=960-12-0553-5}}</ref>

After the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917, a team of architects and urban planners including [[Thomas Mawson]] and [[Ernest Hebrard]], a French architect, chose the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era as the basis of their (re)building designs for Thessaloniki's city centre. The new city plan included axes, diagonal streets and monumental squares, with a [[Grid plan|street grid]] that would channel traffic smoothly. The plan of 1917 included provisions for future population expansions and a street and road network that would be, and still is sufficient today.<ref name=Gerolympos/> It contained sites for public buildings and provided for the restoration of Byzantine churches and Ottoman mosques.

[[File:Thessalonikki, Macedonia, Greece 777.jpg|thumb|A street in [[Ladadika]] district]]

Also called the ''historic centre'', it is divided into several districts, including Dimokratias Square (Democracy Sq. known also as ''Vardaris'') ''[[Ladadika]]'' (where many entertainment venues and tavernas are located), ''Kapani'' (where the [[Modiano Market|city's central Modiano market]] is located), ''Diagonios'', ''[[Navarinou Square|Navarinou]]'', ''[[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda|Rotonda]]'', ''[[Agias Sofias Square|Agia Sofia]]'' and ''Hippodromio'', which are all located around Thessaloniki's most central point, [[Aristotelous Square]].

Various commercial stoas around Aristotelous are named from the city's past and historic personalities of the city, like stoa [[Maurice de Hirsch|Hirsch]], stoa [[Carasso family|Carasso]]/Ermou, Pelosov, Colombou, Levi, [[Modiano Market|Modiano]], Morpurgo, Mordoch, Simcha, Kastoria, Malakopi, Olympios, Emboron, Rogoti, Vyzantio, Tatti, Agiou Mina, Karipi etc.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kathimerini.gr/801932/article/ta3idia/sthn-ellada/stis-stoes-ths-8essalonikhs |title=Στις στοές της Θεσσαλονίκης kathimerini.gr |date=2 February 2015 |access-date=2 April 2020 |archive-date=9 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181209231603/http://www.kathimerini.gr/801932/article/ta3idia/sthn-ellada/stis-stoes-ths-8essalonikhs |url-status=live }}</ref>

The western portion of the city centre is home to Thessaloniki's law courts, its [[New railway station (Thessaloniki)|central international railway station]] and the [[Port of Thessaloniki|port]], while its eastern side hosts the city's two universities, the [[Thessaloniki International Fair|Thessaloniki International Exhibition Centre]], the city's [[Kaftanzoglio Stadium|main stadium]], its archaeological and Byzantine museums, the new city hall and its central parks and gardens, namely those of the ''ΧΑΝΘ'' and ''Pedion tou Areos''.

===Ano Poli===
{{Main|Upper Town (Thessaloniki)}}
Ano Poli (also called ''Old Town'' and literally the ''Upper Town'') is the heritage-listed district north of Thessaloniki's city centre that was not engulfed by the [[Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917|great fire of 1917]] and was declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] through the ministerial actions of [[Melina Merkouri]], during the 1980s. It consists of Thessaloniki's most traditional part of the city, still featuring small stone-paved streets, old squares and homes featuring old [[Greek architecture|Greek]] and [[Ottoman architecture]]. It is the favourite area of Thessaloniki's poets, intellectuals and bohemians.

{{wide image|GR-thessalon-pano-1.jpg|700px|align-cap=center|Panorama of the city from ''Ano Poli''}}

Ano Poli is also the highest point in Thessaloniki and as such, is the location of the city's acropolis, its Byzantine fort, the [[Heptapyrgion (Thessaloniki)|Heptapyrgion]], a large portion of the [[Walls of Thessaloniki|city's remaining walls]], and with many of its additional Ottoman and Byzantine structures still standing. With the capture of Thessaloniki by the Ottomans in 1430, after a lengthy [[Siege of Thessalonica (1422–1430)|siege]] of the city from 1422 to 1430, the Ottomans settled in Ano Poli. This geographical choice was attributed to the higher level of Ano Poli, which was convenient to control the rest of the population remotely, and the microclimate of the area, which favoured better living conditions in terms of hygiene compared to the areas of the centre.

Today, the area provides access to the ''[[Kedrinos Lofos|Seich Sou]]'' Forest National Park<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.seihsou.gr/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=32 |title=Σεϊχ Σου (Seich-Sou) |work=Seich Sou Forest National Park Web site (in Greek) |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113050610/http://www.seihsou.gr/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=32 |archive-date=13 November 2010 }}</ref> and features panoramic views of the whole city and the [[Thermaic Gulf]]. On clear days [[Mount Olympus]], at about {{cvt|100|km|0}} away across the gulf, can also be seen towering the horizon.

The [[Thessaloniki railway station]] is located on Monastiriou street.

Other extended and densely built-up residential areas are [[Charilaou]] and [[Toumba (Thessaloniki)|Toumba]], which is divided into "Ano Toumpa" and "Kato Toumpa". Toumba was named after the homonymous hill of Toumba, where extensive archaeological research takes place. It was created by refugees after the 1922 Asia Minor disaster and the population exchange (1923–24). On ''Exochon'' avenue (''Rue des Campagnes'', today Vasilissis Olgas and Vasileos Georgiou Avenues), was up until the 1920s home to the city's most affluent residents and formed the outermost suburbs of the city at the time, with the area close to the [[Thermaic Gulf]], from the 19th-century holiday villas which defined the area.<ref>Some of them include [[Villa Allatini]], [[Villa Bianca (Thessaloniki)|Villa Bianca]], [[Cultural Centre of the National Bank of Greece Cultural Foundation in Thessaloniki|Villa Mehmet Kapanci]], [[Folk Art and Ethnological Museum of Macedonia and Thrace|Villa Modiano]], [[Municipal Art Gallery (Thessaloniki)|Villa Mordoch]], Hatzilazarou/Siaga Mansion, Villa Morpurgo/Zardinidi, Villa Jeborga/Salem (the old Italian consulate), Villa Nechama, Villa Marocco, Château Mon Bonheur etc.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mathra-sights.gr/hotspot.php?id=7&lan=el |title=Municipal Art Gallery (Thessaloniki) – Official Website |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518093710/http://www.mathra-sights.gr/hotspot.php?id=7&lan=el |archive-date=18 May 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Northwest Thessaloniki forms the main entry point into the city of Thessaloniki with the avenues of Monastiriou, Lagkada and 26is Octovriou passing through it, as well as the extension of the A1 motorway, feeding into Thessaloniki's city centre. The area is home to the [[Thessaloniki Bus Station|Macedonia InterCity Bus Terminal]] ([[KTEL (Greece)|KTEL]]), the [[Thessaloniki railway station]], and the [[Zeitenlik]] [[Allies (World War I)|Allied]] memorial [[military cemetery]].

Monuments have also been erected in honour of the fighters of the [[Greek Resistance]], as in these areas the Resistance was very active: the monument of Greek National Resistance in Sykies, the monument of Greek National Resistance in Stavroupolis, the Statue of the struggling Mother in Eptalofos Square and the monument of the young Greeks who were executed by the Nazis on 11 May 1944 in Xirokrini. In Eptalofos, on 15 May 1941, one month after the occupation of the country, the first resistance organization in Greece, "Eleftheria", was founded, with its newspaper and the first illegal printing house in the city of Thessaloniki.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.alterthess.gr/content/ekdilosi-afieroma-stin-efimerida-eleytheria-tin-proti-efimerida-tis-antistasis |title=Εκδήλωση-αφιέρωμα στην εφημερίδα "ΕΛΕΥΘΕΡΙΑ", την πρώτη εφημερίδα της Αντίστασης |date=2 April 2016 |access-date=7 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404073425/http://www.alterthess.gr/content/ekdilosi-afieroma-stin-efimerida-eleytheria-tin-proti-efimerida-tis-antistasis |archive-date=4 April 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="καζάνας1">{{Cite web |url=https://www.efsyn.gr/nisides/241619_i-xirokrini-tis-antistasis |title=Η Ξηροκρήνη της Αντίστασης |last=Καζάνας |first=Γιώργος |date=2 May 2020 |website=Εφημερίδα των Συντακτών |access-date=9 May 2020 |archive-date=15 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200615074213/https://www.efsyn.gr/nisides/241619_i-xirokrini-tis-antistasis |url-status=live }}</ref>

Today southeastern Thessaloniki has in some way become an extension of the city centre, with the avenues of Megalou Alexandrou, Georgiou Papandreou (Antheon), Vasileos Georgiou, Vasilissis Olgas, Delfon, Konstantinou Karamanli (Nea Egnatia) and Papanastasiou passing through it, enclosing an area traditionally called {{Lang|el|Ντεπώ|italic=no}} ({{Lang|el-Latn|Depó|italic=yes}}'','' <small>lit.</small> Dépôt), from the name of the old tram station, owned by a French company.

The municipality of [[Kalamaria]] is also located in southeastern Thessaloniki and was firstly, inhabited mainly by Greek refugees from [[Asia Minor]] and [[East Thrace]] after 1922.<ref>ΘΕΣΣΑΛΟΝΙΚΗ ΣΥΝΤΟΜΟΣ ΤΟΥΡΙΣΤΙΚΟΣ ΟΔΗΓΟΣ, εκδόσεις Μαλλιάρη, 978-960-457-587-9.</ref> There are built the [[Northern Greece Naval Command]] and the old royal palace (called [[Palataki (Thessaloniki)|Palataki]]), located on the most westerly point of [[Mikro Emvolo]] cape.

Because of Thessaloniki's importance during the [[early Christianity|early Christian]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] periods, the city is host to several Paleochristian monuments that have significantly contributed to the development of [[Byzantine art]] and [[Byzantine architecture|architecture]] throughout the [[Byzantine Empire]] as well as [[Serbia]].<ref name="UNESCO"/> The evolution of Imperial [[Byzantine architecture]] and the prosperity of Thessaloniki go hand in hand, especially during the first years of the Empire,<ref name="UNESCO"/> when the city continued to flourish. It was at that time that the [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda|Complex of]] [[Roman emperor]] [[Galerius]] was built, as well as the first church of [[Saint Demetrius|Hagios Demetrios]].<ref name="UNESCO"/>

By the eighth century, the city had become an important administrative centre of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and handled much of the [[Byzantine Empire|Empire]]'s [[Balkans|Balkan]] affairs.<ref name="AUTH 2">[http://www.auth.gr/univ/city/city/index_el.html Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, "The City of Thessaloniki"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517174744/http://www.auth.gr/univ/city/city/index_el.html |date=17 May 2011 }} (in Greek)</ref> During that time, the city saw the creation of more notable Christian churches that are now part of Thessaloniki's UNESCO World Heritage Site, such as the [[Church of Saint Catherine, Thessaloniki|Church of Saint Catherine]], the [[Hagia Sophia (Thessaloniki)|Hagia Sophia of Thessaloniki]], the [[Church of the Acheiropoietos]], the [[Church of Panagia Chalkeon]].<ref name="UNESCO"/> When the [[Ottoman Empire]] took control of Thessaloniki in 1430, most of the city's churches were converted into [[mosques]],<ref name="UNESCO"/> but have survived to this day. Travellers such as [[Paul Lucas (traveller)|Paul Lucas]] and [[Abdulmejid I]]<ref name="UNESCO"/> document the city's wealth in Christian monuments during the years of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control of the city.

The church of [[Hagios Demetrios]] burned down during the [[Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917]], as did many other city monuments, but it was rebuilt. During [[World War II]], the city was extensively bombed and as such many of Thessaloniki's Paleochristian and Byzantine monuments were heavily damaged.<ref name="AUTH 2"/> Some of the sites were not restored until the 1980s. Thessaloniki has more monuments listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site than any other city in Greece, a total of 15 monuments.<ref name="UNESCO"/> They have been listed since 1988.<ref name="UNESCO"/>

After [[WWII]] and the [[Greek Civil War]], heavy industrialization of the city's suburbs began in the mid-1950s.<ref>Note also the concomitant decrease of water cleanliness in Glenn Eldon Curtis, ed., ''Greece, a Country Study'', Volume 550, Issues 87-995 (Washington, DC: Federal Research Division, United States Department of the Army, 1995), 92–107. {{ISBN|0844408565}}</ref>

During the 1980s, a spate of factory shutdowns occurred, mostly of automobile manufacturers, such as [[Agricola (vehicles)|Agricola]], [[AutoDiana]], [[EBIAM]], [[Motoemil]], [[Pantelemidis-TITAN]] and [[C.AR (automobiles)|C.AR]]. Since the 1990s, companies took advantage of cheaper labour markets and more lax regulations than in other countries, and among the largest companies to shut down factories were [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pfi.gr/ |title=Pfi (Βφλ) |publisher=Pfi.gr |access-date=11 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313053025/http://www.pfi.gr/ |archive-date=13 March 2012 }}</ref> AVEZ pasta industry (one of the first industrial factories in northern Greece, built in 1926),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.makthes.gr/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=10661 |title=Information is in Greek from one of the city's largest dailies |publisher=Makthes.gr |date=29 December 2007 |access-date=22 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228000324/http://www.makthes.gr/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=10661 |archive-date=28 December 2008 }}</ref> [[Philkeram Johnson]], AGNO dairy and VIAMIL.

The Jewish population in Greece is the oldest in mainland Europe (see [[Romaniote Jews|Romaniotes]]). When [[Paul the Apostle]] came to Thessaloniki, he taught in the area of what today is called ''Upper City''. Later, during the Ottoman period, with the coming of Sephardic Jews from Spain, the community of Thessaloniki became mostly Sephardic. Thessaloniki became the largest centre in Europe of the [[Sephardic Jews]], who nicknamed the city ''la madre de Israel'' (Israel's mother)<ref name="Holocaust"/> and "Jerusalem of the Balkans".<ref>Abrams, Dennis (2009); ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=YkKVeMIMOmoC&dq=sarkozy+jewish&pg=PA26 Nicolas Sarkozy (Modern World Leaders)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230407070823/https://books.google.com/books?id=YkKVeMIMOmoC&dq=sarkozy+jewish&pg=PA26 |date=7 April 2023 }}'', Chelsea House Publishers, p. 26, Library Binding edition, {{ISBN|1-60413-081-4}}</ref> It also included the historically significant and ancient Greek-speaking [[Romaniote Jews|Romaniote]] community. During the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era, Thessaloniki's Sephardic community was half of the population according to the Ottoman Census of 1902 and almost 40% the city's population of 157,000 about 1913; Jewish merchants were prominent in commerce until the ethnic Greek population increased after Thessaloniki was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece in 1913. By the 1680s, about 300 families of Sephardic Jews, followers of [[Sabbatai Zevi]], had converted to [[Islam]], becoming a sect known as the ''[[Dönmeh]]'' (convert), and migrated to Salonika, whose population was majority Jewish. They established an active community that thrived for about 250 years. Many of their descendants later became prominent in trade.<ref>Kirsch, Adam [http://www.tnr.com/book/review/the-other-secret-jews ''The Other Secret Jews''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217043805/http://www.tnr.com/book/review/the-other-secret-jews |date=17 February 2010 }} – Review of Marc David Baer's ''The Dönme: Jewish Converts, Muslim Revolutionaries, and Secular Turks'', ''The New Republic'', 15 February 2010.

[[File:Jews of Salonika-1917.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Jewish family of Salonika in 1917]]

From the second half of the 19th century with the Ottoman reforms, the Jewish community had a new revival. Many French and especially [[Italian Jews]] (from [[Livorno]] and other cities), influential in introducing new methods of education and developing new schools and intellectual environments for the Jewish population, were established in Thessaloniki. Such modernists introduced also new techniques and ideas from the industrialised Western Europe and from the 1880s the city began to industrialize. The Italian-Jewish Allatini brothers led Jewish entrepreneurship, establishing [[Mill (grinding)|milling]] and other food industries, [[brick]]making and processing plants for [[tobacco]]. Several traders supported the introduction of a large textile-production industry, superseding the weaving of cloth in a system of artisanal production. Notable names of the era include among others the Italo-Jewish Modiano family and the [[Allatini (company)|Allatini]]. [[Benrubi SA|Benrubis]] founded also in 1880 one of the first retail companies in the Balkans.

After the [[Balkan Wars]], Thessaloniki was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Greece]] in 1913. At first, the community feared that the annexation would lead to difficulties and during the first years its political stance was, in general, anti-[[Venizelism|Venizelist]] and pro-royalist/conservative. The [[Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917]] during [[World War I]] burned much of the centre of the city and left 50,000 Jews homeless of the total of 72,000 residents who were burned out.<ref name="History"/> Having lost homes and their businesses, many Jews emigrated to the United States, Palestine, and Paris. They could not wait for the government to create a new urban plan for rebuilding, which was eventually done.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Great Fire in Salonica |url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Greece/History/GreatFireInSalonica1917.html |work=Greece History |publisher=Hellenica Website |access-date=9 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018013408/http://www.mlahanas.de/Greece/History/GreatFireInSalonica1917.html |archive-date=18 October 2011 }}</ref>

After the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]] in 1922 and the bilateral population exchange between Greece and Turkey, many refugees came to Greece. Nearly 100,000 ethnic Greeks resettled in Thessaloniki, reducing the proportion of Jews in the total community. After this, Jews made up about 20% of the city's population. During the interwar period, Greece granted Jewish citizens the same [[civil rights]] as other Greek citizens.<ref name="History"/> In March 1926, Greece re-emphasized that all citizens of Greece enjoyed equal rights, and a considerable proportion of the city's Jews decided to stay. During the [[Metaxas regime]], the stance towards Jews improved even more.

[[World War II]] brought disaster for the Jewish Greeks, since in 1941 the Germans occupied Greece and began actions against the Jewish population. Greeks of the [[Greek resistance|Resistance]] helped save some of the Jewish residents.<ref name="Holocaust"/> By the 1940s, the great majority of the Jewish Greek community firmly identified as both Greek and Jewish. According to [[Misha Glenny]], such Greek Jews had largely not encountered "anti-Semitism as in its North European form."<ref>Misha Glenny, ''The Balkans'', p.&nbsp;512.</ref>

In 1943, the Nazis began brutal actions against the historic Jewish population in Thessaloniki, forcing them into a [[ghetto]] near the railroad lines and beginning [[deportation]] to concentration and labor camps. They deported and exterminated approximately 94% of Thessaloniki's Jews of all ages during the [[Holocaust]].<ref name="Holocaust2">[http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/greece/nonflash/eng/salonika.htm www.ushmm.org "Jewish Community in Greece"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506235802/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/greece/nonflash/eng/salonika.htm |date=6 May 2009 }}, Online Exhibit, US Holocaust Museum.

Since the late 19th century, many merchants from Western Europe (mainly from France and Italy) were established in the city. They had an important role in the social and economic life of the city and introduced new industrial techniques. Their main district was what is known today as the "Frankish district" (near [[Ladadika]]), where the Catholic church designed by [[Vitaliano Poselli]] is also situated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kathimerini.gr/847064/article/politismos/polh/ekato-xronia-filo3enias |title=Εκατό χρόνια φιλοξενίας |date=25 January 2016 |access-date=19 April 2019 |archive-date=19 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190419094521/http://www.kathimerini.gr/847064/article/politismos/polh/ekato-xronia-filo3enias |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://parallaximag.gr/thessaloniki/i-architektoniki-istoria-tou-fragkoma |title=Η αρχιτεκτονικη ιστορία του Φραγκομαχαλά |date=27 May 2015 |access-date=19 April 2019 |archive-date=19 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190419094524/https://parallaximag.gr/thessaloniki/i-architektoniki-istoria-tou-fragkoma |url-status=live }}</ref> A part of them left after the incorporation of the city into the Greek kingdom, while others, who were of Jewish faith, were exterminated by the [[Nazis]].

A large part of them were Catholics, as a result of actions by the [[Congregation of the Mission|Lazarists]] society, which had its base in the city.

Another group is the [[Armenians|Armenian]] community which dates back to the Byzantine and Ottoman periods. During the 20th century, after the [[Armenian genocide]] and the defeat of the Greek army in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–22)]], many fled to Greece including Thessaloniki.

[[File:Frappe (4547117210).jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|[[Frappé coffee]]]]
[[File:Bougatsa.png|thumb|[[Bougatsa]], typical Thessalonian treat]]

Because Thessaloniki remained under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule for about 100 years longer than southern Greece, it has retained a lot of its Eastern character, including its culinary tastes.<ref name="Frommer's Food">{{cite book |title=Frommer's Greece |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780470165386 |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780470165386/page/627 627] |quote=Cuisine Thessaloniki. |year=2008 |publisher=Wiley Publishing Inc. |access-date=9 February 2012 |isbn=9780470260814}}</ref> Spices in particular play an important role in the cuisine of Thessaloniki,<ref name="Frommer's Food"/> something which is not true to the same degree about Greece's southern regions.<ref name="Frommer's Food"/> Thessaloniki's Ladadika borough is a particularly busy area in regards to Thessalonian cuisine, with most [[taverna]]s serving traditional [[meze]] and other such culinary delights.<ref name="Frommer's Food"/>

[[Bougatsa]], a breakfast [[pastry]], which can be either sweet or savory, is very popular throughout the city and has spread around other parts of Greece and the Balkans as well. Another popular snack is ''[[Simit|koulouri]]''.

Notable sweets of the city are ''Trigona'', ''Roxákia'', ''[[:el:Κουρκουμπίνι|Kourkoubinia]]'' and ''Armenonville''. A stereotypical Thessalonian [[coffee]] drink is [[Frappé coffee]]. Frappé was invented in the [[Thessaloniki International Fair]] in 1957 and has since spread throughout Greece and Cyprus to become a hallmark of the Greek [[coffee culture]].

''Kapani'' or ''Agora Viali'' is the oldest central market in Thessaloniki, with shops selling fish, meat, vegetables, fruits, drinks, olives, sweets, nuts, spices<ref>{{cite web |title=Kapani Market |url=https://www.thessalonikitourism.gr/index.php/en/component/k2/item/164-kapani-market |website=Thessaloniki Tourism |access-date=13 October 2022 |language=en-gb}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Kapani or Agora Vlali – Thessaloniki |url=https://www.greekgastronomyguide.gr/en/item/agora-kapani-thessaloniki/ |website=Greek Gastronomy Guide |access-date=13 October 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=ΑΡΧΙΚΗ |url=https://kapani.gr/ |website=Αγορά Καπάνι Θεσσαλονίκης |access-date=13 October 2022 |language=el}}</ref> and [[Modiano Market]] is located nearby.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kapani and Modiano Markets |url=https://www.afar.com/places/modiano-market-thessaloniki |website=AFAR Media |access-date=13 October 2022 |language=en}}</ref>

===Tourism===
[[File:Ξενοδοχείο Λουξεμβούργο (1924), Κομνηνών 6 & Καλαποθάκη, Θεσσαλονίκη.jpg|thumb|160px|Hotel Luxemvourgo on Komninon Street (1924, arch. [[:el:Ελί Μοδιάνο|Eli Modiano]])]]
[[File:Thessaloniki, Greece - panoramio (2).jpg|thumb|200px|View of the [[Makedonia Palace]] on the promenade]]

A tourism boom took place in the 2010s, during the years of mayor [[Yiannis Boutaris|Boutaris]], especially from the neighboring countries, Austria, Israel and Turkey. In 2010, overnight stays of foreign tourists in the city were around 250,000. In 2018, overnight stays of foreign tourists were estimated to reach 3,000,000 people. Thessaloniki is known as "[[The City That Never Sleeps (nickname)|the city that never sleeps]]" and a "party capital" due to its thriving [[nightlife]], young atmosphere and famous [[24/7|24-hour culture]].<ref name="lonelyplanet.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/new-york-city/travel-tips-and-articles/76165 |title=Lonely Planet's top 10 cities for 2011 |access-date=31 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103065648/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/new-york-city/travel-tips-and-articles/76165 |archive-date=3 November 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Music===
The city is viewed as a romantic one in Greece, and as such Thessaloniki is commonly featured in [[Music of Greece|Greek songs]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Τραγούδια για τη Θεσσαλονίκη 2 |url=http://homelessmontresor.blogspot.com/2007/06/2.html |date=4 June 2007 |publisher=homelessmontresor |access-date=9 April 2011}}</ref> There are a number of famous songs that go by the name 'Thessaloniki' ([[rebetiko]], [[laïko]] etc.) or include the name in their title.<ref>{{cite web |title=Τραγούδια για την Θεσσαλονίκη |url=http://www.musicheaven.gr/html/modules.php?name=Splatt_Forums&file=viewtopic&topic=20544&gotolast=1 |date=13 February 2010 |publisher=Musicheaven.gr |access-date=9 April 2011}}</ref>

During the 1930s and 1940s, the city became a centre of the [[Rebetiko]] music, partly because of the [[4th of August Regime|Metaxas]] censorship, which was stricter in Athens. [[Vassilis Tsitsanis]] wrote some of his best songs{{According to whom|date=October 2022}} in Thessaloniki.

The city is the birthplace of significant composers in the Greek music scene, such as [[Manolis Chiotis]], [[Stavros Kouyioumtzis]] and [[Dionysis Savvopoulos]]. It is also notable for its rock music scene and its many rock groups; some became famous such as [[Xylina Spathia]], [[Trypes]] or the [[pop rock]] group [[Onirama]].

Between 1962–1997 and 2005–2008 the city also hosted the [[Thessaloniki Song Festival]]. In the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013]] Greece was represented by [[Koza Mostra]] and [[Agathonas Iakovidis]], both from Thessaloniki.

===In popular culture===
* In May 1936, a massive strike by tobacco workers led to general anarchy in the city and [[Ioannis Metaxas]] (future dictator, then PM) ordered its repression. The events and the deaths of the protesters inspired [[Yiannis Ritsos]] to write the ''Epitafios''.
* On 22 May 1963, [[Grigoris Lambrakis]], pacifist and MP, was assassinated by two far-right extremists driving a three-wheeled vehicle. The event led to political crisis. [[Costa Gavras]] directed ''[[Z (1969 film)|Z]]'' (1969) based on it, two years after the [[Greek military junta of 1967–74|military junta]] had seized power in Greece.
* Notable films set or shot in Thessaloniki, among others, include ''[[Street of Shadows (1937 film)|Mademoiselle Docteur/Salonique, nid d'espions]]'' (1937) by [[Georg Wilhelm Pabst]], ''The Barefooted Battalion'' (1954) by Greg Tallas (Gregory Thalassinos), ''O Atsídas'' (1961) by [[Giannis Dalianidis]], ''Parenthesis'' (1968) by [[Takis Kanellopoulos]], ''[[Triumph of the Spirit]]'' (1989) by [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert M. Young]], ''[[Eternity and a Day]]'' by [[Theo Angelopoulos]] (1998) and ''[[Cloudy Sunday|Ouzeri Tsitsanis]]'' (2015) by [[Manousos Manousakis]].

==Transport==

===Tram===
[[File:Οι γραμμές του τράμ, Οδός Αγίου Μηνά, Θεσσαλονίκη.jpg|thumb|180px|The old tram lines on Agiou Mina Street]]

[[Tram]] was the main, oldest and most popular public urban mean of Thessalonians in the past. It was in operation from 1893 to 1957, when it was disestablished by the government of [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]]. The Belgian ''Compagnie de Tramways et d' Éclairage Électrique de Salonique'' operated it from 1912 until 1940, when the company was purchased by the Hellenic State. The operating base and tram station was in the district of Dépôt.

Before the [[Greek government-debt crisis|economic crisis of 2009]], there were various proposals for new tram lines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eventsinteractive.com/artion/Docs/DevConf//PPT/6.GIANNOPOULOS.pdf |title=Προτάσεις της ΓΚΜΘ 2000 για τραμ |access-date=30 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521004738/http://www.eventsinteractive.com/artion/Docs/DevConf//PPT/6.GIANNOPOULOS.pdf |archive-date=21 May 2013 |url-status=dead |language=el}}</ref>

Because of the Greek economic crisis, all international train links from the city were suspended in February 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tanea.gr/ellada/article/?aid=4618021 |title=Αναστέλλονται όλα τα διεθνή δρομολόγια του ΟΣΕ [All international routes of OSE have been suspended] |publisher=[[Ta Nea]] |date=13 February 2011 |language=el}}</ref> Until then, the city was a major railway hub for the Balkans, with direct connections to [[Sofia]], [[Skopje]], [[Belgrade]], [[Moscow]], [[Vienna]], [[Budapest]], [[Bucharest]] and [[Istanbul]], alongside [[Athens]] and other destinations in Greece. Daily through trains to Sofia and Belgrade were restarted in May 2014 but stopped again for COVID-19. Thessaloniki remains one of Greece's most important railway hubs and has the biggest [[marshalling yard]] in the country.

Regional train services within Greece (operated by [[TrainOSE]], the [[Hellenic Railways Organization]]'s train operating company), link the city with other parts of the country, from its central railway passenger station, called the "[[New railway station (Thessaloniki)|New railway station]]" located at the western end of Thessaloniki's city centre.

The [[Port of Thessaloniki]] connects the city with seasonal ferries to the [[Sporades]] and other north Aegean islands, with its [[Passenger|passenger terminal]], being one of the largest in the [[Aegean Sea]] basin; having handled around 162,731 [[passengers]] in 2007.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thpa.gr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=78&Itemid=95&lang=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003102959/http://www.thpa.gr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=78&Itemid=95&lang=en |url-status=dead |title=Port of Thessaloniki passenger terminal |archive-date=3 October 2015 |access-date=7 April 2023}}</ref> Meanwhile, ongoing actions have been going on for more connections and the port is recently being upgraded, as Thessaloniki is also slowly turning into a major tourist port for cruising in the eastern Mediterranean.

[[File:Ο Περιφερειακός της Θεσσαλονίκης - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Part of the [[ring road]] (Peripheriaki Odos)]]
Thessaloniki lies on the crossroads of the [[A1 motorway (Greece)|A1]]/[[European route E75|E75]], [[A2 motorway (Greece)|A2]]/[[European route E90|E90]] and [[A25 motorway (Greece)|A25]] motorways; which connect the city with other parts of the country, as well as the neighbouring countries of [[North Macedonia]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Turkey]].

The city itself is bypassed by the C-shaped [[Thessaloniki Inner Ring Road]] (''Esoteriki Peripheriaki Odos'', {{langx|el|Εσωτερική Περιφεριακή Οδός}}), which all of the above motorways connect onto it. The western end of the route begins at the junction with the [[A1 motorway (Greece)|A1]]/[[A2 motorway (Greece)|A2]] motorways in ''Lachanagora'' District. Clockwise it heads northeast around the city, passing through the northwestern suburbs, the forest of ''Seich Sou'' and through to the southeast suburb/borough of [[Kalamaria]]. The ring road ends at a large junction with the [[A24 motorway (Greece)|A24]] motorway, which then continues south to [[Chalkidiki]], passing through [[Thessaloniki metropolitan area|Thessaloniki's]] outer southeast suburbs.

The speed limit on this motorway is {{convert|90|km/h}}; it currently has three traffic lanes for each direction and forms the city's most vital road link; handling more than 120,000 vehicles daily,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.makthes.gr/news/reportage/57082/ |title=Περιφερειακή οδός: Επικίνδυνη εάν δεν γίνουν παρεμβάσεις [Ring Road: Dangerous if measures are not taken] |publisher=[[Makedonia (newspaper)|Makedonia]] |date=19 June 2010 |author=Koutsabaris, Fotis |language=el |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120908063721/http://www.makthes.gr/news/reportage/57082/ |archive-date=8 September 2012 }}</ref> instead of the 30,000 vehicles that it was originally designed to handle in 1975.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wheels.ana-mpa.gr/articleview2.php?id=2145 |title=- Καρμανιόλα" η περιφερειακή οδός Θεσσαλονίκης που θεωρείται πλέον πεπερασμένη [The Ring Road is considered dangerous and outdated] |publisher=[[Athens News Agency]] |date=25 April 2006 |language=el |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506091242/http://wheels.ana-mpa.gr/articleview2.php?id=2145 |archive-date=6 May 2006 }}</ref>

Despite the large effort that was made in 2004 to improve the motorway features of the Thessaloniki [[ring road]], the motorway is still insufficient to tackle Thessaloniki's increasing traffic and metropolitan population.
