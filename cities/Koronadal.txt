According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 195,398 people.{{PH census|current}}

It is the capital of the province of [[South Cotabato]] as well as the regional administrative center of [[Soccsksargen]] (Region XII) and also the second most populous city in both former and latter after [[General Santos|General Santos City]].<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://businessmirror.com.ph/2019/03/10/phls-one-stop-shop-halal-center-opens/ |title= PHL's one-stop shop halal center opens |date= March 10, 2019 |access-date= December 16, 2021 |work= BusinessMirror |last= Usman |first= Edd }}</ref>

Koronadal is one of the [[Planned community|Planned Cities of the Philippines]] that were signed by [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] on 1965. It became a component city of [[South Cotabato]] by virtue of Republic Act 8803 dated October 8, 2000.<ref name=facts>{{Cite web |url=http://www.koronadal.gov.ph/city_quick_facts.htm |title=Kanami Koronadal :: Official Website of the City Government |access-date=May 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711193518/http://www.koronadal.gov.ph/city_quick_facts.htm |archive-date=July 11, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Koronadal is one of the two cities in Mindanao where majority of the citizens are ethnic [[Hiligaynon people|Hiligaynons]], who comprise 95% of the city's population, the other being [[Tacurong City]], [[Sultan Kudarat]].<ref name=facts/> In 2003 and 2005 the city was recognized as "Most Competitive City" in the small-city category, and in 2005 and 2006 as the most business friendly city in Mindanao.<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.mindanews.com/business/2007/11/koronadal-searching-for-product-to-serve-as-citys-identity/ |date= November 6, 2007 |access-date= December 16, 2021 |last= Estabillo |first= Allen |title= Koronadal searching for product to serve as city's identity |work= [[MindaNews]] }}</ref>

==Etymology==
The word Koronadal is believed to have been derived from two [[Blaan language|Blaan words]]—''kalon'' meaning cogon grass, and ''nadal'' or ''datal'' meaning plain, which aptly described the place to the natives.<ref name="kanami">{{Cite web |url=http://www.koronadal.gov.ph/aboutkoronadal.htm |title=Kanami Koronadal :: Official Website |access-date=May 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420113134/http://www.koronadal.gov.ph/aboutkoronadal.htm |archive-date=April 20, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On the other hand, '''Marbel''', which is another name for the poblacion, is a Blaan term ''marb el'' which means "murky waters" referring to a river, now called the Marbel River.

==History==
[[File:Cotabato province 1918 map.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[Cotabato (province)|Cotabato province]] 1918 map]]

The settlement of Koronadal and its creation as a municipality by virtue of Executive Order No. #82 dated August 18, 1947, was marked by a rapid initial development, so that when the province of [[South Cotabato]] was created under Republic Act No. 4849 on July 18, 1966, it easily became the capital town. In the past, the place was populated by [[Blaan people]] and [[Maguindanao people|Maguindanaons]].<ref name="kanami" />

Koronadal City used to comprise the area extending from the banks of [[Buluan Lake]] to the north to Barangay Polonoling in the municipality of [[Tupi, South Cotabato]] to the south from Quezon mountain range to the northeast to the municipality of [[T'boli, South Cotabato]] to the southeast.

It was on August 18, 1947, when President [[Manuel Roxas]] signed the Executive Order creating the municipalities in the entire province of Cotabato, one of which was Marbel (now Koronadal). The same executive order likewise mandated the official function of the municipal government which began after the qualification and election of the first set of municipal officials.

The municipal government of Koronadal began its official function on January 1, 1948, with an approved Annual Estimated Budget of {{Philippine peso|30,000.00|1948|link=yes}}. The land area of the municipality by then was comparable with the Province of [[Bataan]] embracing the present municipalities of [[Banga, South Cotabato|Banga]], [[Lake Sebu, South Cotabato|Lake Sebu]], [[Norala]], [[Santo Niño, South Cotabato|Santo Niño]], [[Surallah]], [[T'Boli, South Cotabato|T'Boli]], [[Tampakan]], [[Tupi, South Cotabato|Tupi]], and [[Isulan]] in Sultan Kudarat.

Municipal Council Resolution No. 32, Series of 1948 mandated and proclaimed January 10 of each year as the Municipal Town Fiesta commemorating the foundation of Marbel Settlement District of the National Land Settlement.

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
Koronadal was converted into a component city of South Cotabato by virtue of Republic Act No. 8803 on October 8, 2000. At present, Koronadal City is a fast-developing growth center composed of twenty-seven barangays including the four zones in the poblacion. Being the capital city of South Cotabato, it is the center of the province in terms of political, cultural and socio-economic activities.

By virtue of Executive Order No. 304 signed by then President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]], Koronadal City was named as the Regional political and socio-economic center of [[Soccsksargen]] on March 30, 2004. Regional departments, bureaus and offices were ordered to move from [[Cotabato City]], the former Regional Center of the Region.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2004/04/27/the-presidents-day-april-27-2004/ |date= April 27, 2004 |access-date= December 16, 2021 |title= The President's Day: April 27, 2004 |work= Official Gazette |publisher= [[Office of the Press Secretary (Philippines)|Office of the Press Secretary]] }}</ref>

==Culture==

===B’laan culture===

The [[B'laan people]] are one of the indigenous peoples of the Southern Philippine island of Mindanao. Another tribe called the Maguindanao also inhabits the same area. The two tribes consider themselves to be brothers and sisters. Long ago, an Arab male (ancestral brother) married a B'laan female (ancestral sister) and through this marriage union, Islam arrived in Southern Mindanao so that when the Spaniards arrived, their attempts to establish Catholicism were unsuccessful in the south. Eventually the B'laan and the Maguindanao became trade partners with the B'laan settling in the mountains and the Maguindanao settling along the coastal areas. From that time until now, the B'laans have been producing rice, vegetables, livestock, and rainforest products. The original religion of the Blaan is Animist. Presently, only 5% of the 8,000 B'laan tribal people are considered to be evangelical.

===Maguindanaon culture===

The cultural diversity of the region is the result of a large influx of migrants from the north during American colonial period which continued later. Found here are three main cultural groups: the early Filipinos who belong to various indigenous tribes living in the highlands and remote areas of Mindanao, the Maguindanaons who were early converts to Islam and who regard the region as their traditional homeland in the historical [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]], and the Catholic Filipinos who founded settlements and communities in the course of their migrations from other parts of the country.

===Catholic culture===

The [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Catholic Filipinos]] make up the great majority (over 70%) of the Southern Philippine population. They are relatively newcomers to the area; the first wave of Christian migrants came in the seventeenth century when the Spaniards sought to populate Zamboanga, Jolo, Dapitan and other areas by encouraging people from Luzon and the Visayas to settle there. In the nineteenth century Spanish policy found considerable success in encouraging migrations to Iligan and Cotabato. 

The Americans continued this pattern during their colonial administration. In 1913 the American colonial government provided resources for the establishment of agricultural colonies in Mindanao. By the time the Philippine Commonwealth was established, Mindanao had become a veritable frontier. Wave upon wave of migrants poured into the region, chiefly among them the Hiligaynons, Cebuanos, Ilocanos, and Kapampangans. These people did much to clear the virgin areas of Mindanao and open them to extensive agriculture and industry.

===Events===
Koronadal also hosted an international activity called Pyesta Kalon Datal: Koronadal International Folkloric Festival in coordination with [[International Council of Organizations of Folklore Festivals and Folk Arts|Conseil international des organisations de festivals de folklore et d'arts traditionnels]] or the International Council of Organizations of Folklore Festivals and Folk Art (CIOFF) last August 10 to 18, 2015<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://www.manilatimes.net/koronadal-goes-international-with-pyesta-kalon-datal/207570/ |date= August 8, 2015 |access-date= December 16, 2021 |work= The Manila Times |title= Koronadal goes international with 'Pyesta Kolon Datal' }}</ref> and August 11 to 18, 2018<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/soccsksargen-tourism/koronadal-city-to-host-2nd-cioff-2018-international-festival/1257922954340255/|title=Koronadal City to host 2nd CIOFF 2018 International Festival &#124; Facebook|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref> and several national activities such as the [[Palarong Pambansa]] in 1996 with [[General Santos]] and solo in 2007, Mindanao Business Forum, and [[National Schools Press Conference]].
