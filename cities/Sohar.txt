'''Sohar''' ({{langx|ar|صُحَار|Ṣuḥār}}) is the capital and largest city of the [[Al Batinah North Governorate]] in [[Oman]].

As the largest town in the region, it has been argued that Sohar is to be identified with the ancient town called 'Omanah' ({{langx|ar|عُمَانَة}}) mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''. This settlement is believed to have given [[Oman]] its name.<ref name="EJ">{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Islam |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9JQ3AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA976 |chapter=Oman |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|E.&nbsp;J.

According to [[Al-Tabari]], in 893 or 894 [[Common Era|C.E.]], during the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid era]], there was a dispute about who should rule Oman amongst local factions. A faction that approached the [[Abbasid]]s was the Bani Sama, who were based in [[Al Buraimi Governorate|Al-Buraimi]] or Tawam, before moving to Sohar. Bani Sama also referred to themselves as the [[Wajihids|Wajihid Dynasty]], and assumed leadership over the region. The present-day town of [[Al-Buraimi]] is part of a historical region that Tabari referred to as '[[Tawam (region)|Tawam]]', which nowadays also includes the adjacent [[United Arab Emirates|U.A.E.]] city of [[Al Ain]].<ref name="TheNational 10-2015">{{cite news |last=Leech |first=Nick |title=The long read: has a lost Arab capital been found on the Oman-UAE border? |publisher=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |url=https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/the-long-read-has-a-lost-arab-capital-been-found-on-the-oman-uae-border-1.4941 |date=2015-10-22 |access-date=2019-01-20}}</ref>

By the [[10th century]], Sohar was one of the richest ports of the [[Persian Gulf]]. It was praised by [[Ibn Hawqal]] and [[Al-Maqdisi]], who called it "flourishing, populous, beautiful, pleasant and delightful", and compared it favourably with the ports of [[China]]. [[Agarwood|Aloes]], wood, bamboo, sandalwood and spices were brought from [[Indian Subcontinent|India]] and frankincense from [[Dhofar]]. The city was sacked by the [[Buwayhids]] in 971 and its trade went into decline. It also suffered from attacks by the merchants of [[Kish Island|Kish]] across the gulf, who briefly took control of the city around 1100. Sohar then became the initial seat of the [[Nabhani dynasty|Sultanate of Sohar]], under the rule of the Bani Nabhan dynasty. They achieved ascendancy after being appointed governors of Sohar by their [[Buyid dynasty|Buyid]] suzerains.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Salimi, Staples |title=Oman: A Maritime History |date=2017 |publisher=Georg Olms Verlag |isbn=978-3-487-15390-2 |pages=}}</ref> The city's famous fort was constructed in the late 13th century by the "[[Ormus|Princes of Hormuz]]" while the city remained under Nabhani control.<ref>{{Cite web |date= |title=قلعة صحار التاريخية .. بوابة عُمان الشمالية في سنوات الحروب في الأزمنة الغابرة |url=http://alwatan.com/details/63310 |website=الوطن |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200721134206/http://alwatan.com/details/63310 |archive-date=2020-07-21}}</ref> The two entities maintained an agreement over maritime and internal control of Oman.<ref name=":0" /> After a period of ruin, Sohar was re-established in the [[15th century]] as a minor port under the Hormuzi-[[Qalhat]]i sphere of influence.<ref name=":0" /> It was still an international port until at least the 16th century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dionisius |first=A. Agius |title=Seafaring in the Arabian Gulf and Oman: People of the Dhow |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2005 |pages=76–77}}</ref>

=== Portuguese occupation ===
In the early [[16th century]], Sohar was conquered by the [[Portuguese Empire]], which used the city to control the entrances to the Arabian Gulf and trade in the region. It was part of a web of fortresses controlled by the Portuguese, from [[Bahrain]] to [[Hormuz Island|Hormuz]], and was depicted in António Bocarro's 17th-century ''Book of Fortresses''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bocarro |first=António |title=Livro das plantas de todas as fortalezas, cidades e povoaçoens do Estado da India Oriental |year=1635 |url=http://purl.pt/27184 |language=pt}}</ref>

=== Recent history ===
Starting on 26 February 2011, Sohar was the site of [[2011 Omani protests|mass protests]], part of the [[Arab Spring]] uprisings. Although protests also occurred in [[Muscat]] and [[Salalah]], the Sohar protests were the biggest in the country, attracting an estimated 2,000 people at times.<ref name="aljazeera2">{{cite news |title=Deaths in Oman protests |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2011/2/27/deaths-in-oman-protests |access-date=15 November 2023 |work=Al Jazeera |date=27 February 2011}}</ref> The protesters' initial demands were for more job opportunities and greater political participation; later demonstrations also called for the release of detained protesters and an inquiry into the use of violence by security forces.<ref name="aljazeera">{{cite news |title=Oman protests resume |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2011/4/2/oman-protests-resume |access-date=15 November 2023 |work=Al Jazeera |date=2 April 2011}}</ref> The protests centered on Sohar's [[Globe Roundabout]]. In response, [[Qaboos bin Said|Sultan Qaboos]] announced reforms and a jobs program, and reshuffled the Omani cabinet.<ref name="aljazeera2"></ref>

== Infrastructure ==

=== Industry ===
A number of enterprises and investment projects in Sohar are centred around the [[Port of Sohar]]. Established in 2002, the port has a strategic importance due to its nearness to the [[Strait of Hormuz]]. It is operated by the Sohar Industrial Port Company (SIPC). With current investments exceeding $12 billion, it is one of the world’s largest port development projects. The port's container terminal, managed by [[Hutchison Port Holdings|Hutchison Ports]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hutchisonports.com/ |title=Hutchison Ports |publisher=Hutchison Ports |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2022-04-14}}</ref> handles the majority of the container cargo of North Al Batinah region of the Sultanate.  

The industrial development of Sohar was prioritised in the Omani Government's [[Economy of Oman|economic development plan]] in 2020. Investments include more than $5 billion in the [[steel]] industry in which Oman aims to be one of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]]'s leading producers. In addition to the steel industry, there is also the industry of [[aluminium]] in Sohar industrial area. The [[Sohar Aluminium]] Company was established in 2004<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bechtel.com/newsroom/releases/2008/06/sohar-aluminium-smelter-makes-first-hot-metal/|website=www.bechtel.com|title=Sohar Aluminum Smelter Project Makes First 'Hot Metal'|publisher=Bechtel|access-date=15 February 2018}}</ref> and it is considered one of the leading projects that play a major role in the sultanate’s economic diversification strategy.
