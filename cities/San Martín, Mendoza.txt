'''San Martín''' is a [[city]] in the north-center part of the [[Mendoza Province]] in [[Argentina]]. It is the capital of the [[San Martín Department, Mendoza|San Martín Department]] and constitutes, with [[Palmira, Mendoza|Palmira]] and [[La Colonia]], the third-largest [[metropolitan area]] in the [[Provinces of Argentina|province]].

==History==
The first San Martín inhabitants were the [[Huarpe]] Milkayak people. The territory was governed by the [[tribal chief]] called Pallamay until 1563, when the first [[European ethnic groups|European]]s under the command of the Captain Pedro Moyano Cornejo, arrived to the area.

The city was known as ''Rodeo de Moyano'' or, alternatively, as ''La Reducción'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''The Reduction''); but its name was changed to ''Villa Los Barriales'' in 1816, when it was included in the Corocorto [[Priesthood]] of Mendoza Province and officially established by the [[Governor of Mendoza]], [[Toribio de Luzuriaga]].

San Martín came into prominence in the [[Argentine War of Independence|war of the Argentine independence]] period, when [[José de San Martín]] received an extensive land grant in the area to take advantage of [[agriculture]] and help the Chilean army of [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] in an effort to prevent new [[Spain|Spanish]] invasions from [[Chile]] to Argentina. In 1823, the governor [[Pedro Molina]] changed the name of the city yet again in homage to the Argentine general José de San Martín,<ref>San Martín was the first city in [[South America]] named in homage to José de San Martín.</ref> who, besides his inestimable historical role, contributed many innovations to the local [[farming]] sector and in [[viticulture]], particularly.

In 1885, the first [[railway]] arrived in San Martin, uniting [[Buenos Aires]] with [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] and Chile. This development brought many [[Italian people|Italian]] immigrants to the area from [[Buenos Aires]]; during the 1950s and '60s, [[National Route 7 (Argentina)|National Route 7]] was built between Buenos Aires and Mendoza Province, converting the city into an important distribution center along the most important highway between Buenos Aires and [[Greater Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Chile]].
