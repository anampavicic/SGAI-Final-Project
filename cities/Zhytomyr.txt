'''Zhytomyr''' ({{langx|uk|Житомир}} {{IPA|uk|ʒɪˈtɔmɪr||audio=Uk-Житомир.ogg}}; see [[#Names|below]] for other names) is a [[city]] in the north of the western half of [[Ukraine]]. It is the [[Capital city|administrative center]] of [[Zhytomyr Oblast]] ([[Oblast|province]]), as well as the administrative center of the surrounding [[Zhytomyr urban hromada]] ([[hromada|commune]]) and [[Zhytomyr Raion]] ([[Raion|district]]). Moreover Zhytomyr consists of two [[Urban districts of Ukraine|urban districts]]: Bohunskyi District and Koroliovskyi District (named in honour of [[Sergey Korolyov]]). Zhytomyr occupies an area of {{convert|65|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}}. Its population is {{Ua-pop-est2022|261,624|.}}

Zhytomyr is a major transport hub. The city lies on a historic route linking the city of [[Kyiv]] with the west through [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]]. Today it links [[Warsaw]] with Kyiv, [[Minsk]] with [[Izmail]], and several major cities of Ukraine. Zhytomyr was also the location of [[Ozerne (air base)|Ozerne airbase]], a key [[Cold War]] strategic aircraft base {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=off}} southeast of the city.

Important economic activities of Zhytomyr include lumber milling, food processing, granite quarrying, metalworking, and the manufacture of musical instruments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/reference/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/zhytomyr|title=Zhytomyr &#124; Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}</ref>

Zhytomyr Oblast is the main center of the [[Poles in Ukraine|Polish minority in Ukraine]], and in the city itself there is a Latin Catholic cathedral and large [[Roman Catholic]] Polish cemetery, founded in 1800. It is regarded as the third biggest Polish cemetery outside Poland, after the [[Lychakivskiy Cemetery]] in [[Lviv]] and [[Rasos Cemetery]] in [[Vilnius]].

[[File:Міський театр (філармонія) P1160580.jpg|thumb|left|Philharmonia theater and old water tower]]
[[File:Zhytomyr2.JPG|thumb|left|Sobornyi Maidan, the main square of Zhytomyr]]

Legend holds that Zhytomyr was established about 884 by Zhytomyr, prince of a Slavic tribe of [[Drevlians]]. This date, 884, is cut into a large stone of the ice age times, standing on the hill where Zhytomyr was founded. Zhytomyr was one of the prominent cities of [[Kievan Rus']]. The first records of the town date from 1240, when it was sacked by the [[Mongol]] hordes of [[Batu Khan]].

In 1320 Zhytomyr was captured by the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and received [[Magdeburg rights]] in 1444. After the [[Union of Lublin]] (1569) the city was incorporated into the [[Crown of the Polish Kingdom]] and in 1667, following the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], it became the capital of the [[Kiev Voivodeship]]. In the [[Second Partition of Poland]] in 1793 it passed to [[Imperial Russia]] and became the capital of the [[Volhynian Governorate]].

Following the [[Union of Lublin]], Zhytomyr became an important center of local administration, seat of the [[starosta]], and capital of Zhytomyr County. Here, [[sejmik]]s of [[Kiev Voivodeship]] took place. In 1572, the town had 142 buildings, a manor house of the starosta and a castle. Following the privilege of King [[Sigismund III Vasa]], Zhytomyr had the right for two fairs a year.

During [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] (1648) Zhytomyr was incorporated into [[Cossack Hetmanate]] state.

In 1667, Zhytomyr became capital of Kiev Voivodeship, and in 1724, a Jesuit school and monastery were opened here. By 1765, Zhytomyr had five churches, including 3 Roman Catholic and 2 Orthodox, and 285 houses.

In 1793 Zhytomyr was incorporated into the [[Russian Empire]], and in 1804 was named capital of the Volhynian Governorate.

During a period of [[Ukrainian independence]] (1917-1920) in 1918, the city was the national capital of [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] for a few weeks. Ultimately, the Ukrainian fight for independence failed and [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] became occupied by [[Soviet Union]]. A new Soviet Ukraine state was formed under Soviet rule - [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. From 1920 Zhytomyr was a part of [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]].

Due to one of [[Stalin]]'s 5-year plans, the city suffered from the man-made famine [[Holodomor|Holodomor of 1932-1933]]. In 2008, the National Museum of the Holodomor Genocide published the National Book of Memory of the Victims of the Holodomor of 1932–1933 in Ukraine. Zhytomyr region - Zhytomyr.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://holodomormuseum.org.ua/hololomor/natsionalna-knyha-pam-iati-zhertv-holodomoru-1932-1933/ |title=National Book of Remembrance of the Victims of the Holodomor of 1932-1933 in Ukraine. Zhytomyr region. — Zhytomyr: «Polissia», 2008. — 1116 pp. |date=3 October 2019 |accessdate=17 April 2023}}</ref> The book has 1116 pages and consists of three sections. According to historical records, more than 8015 people died during Holodomor in 1932–1933.

During [[World War II]] Zhytomyr and the surrounding territory was, for two and a half years (first from [[Operation Barbarossa|9 July 1941]] to 12 November 1943, and again from 19 November 1943 to [[Zhitomir–Berdichev Offensive|31 December 1943]]) under [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] occupation and was [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s Ukrainian headquarters. The Nazi regime in what they called the "Zhytomyr General District" became what historian [[Wendy Lower]] describes as<blockquote>a laboratory for… Himmler's resettlement activists… the elimination of the Jews and German colonization of the East—transformed the landscape and devastated the population to an extent that was not experienced in other parts of Nazi-occupied Europe besides Poland. [While]… [u]ltimately, the exigencies of the war effort and mounting partisan warfare behind the lines prevented Nazi leaders from fully developing and realizing their colonial aims in Ukraine… In addition to the immediate destruction of all Jewish communities, Himmler insisted that the Ukrainian civilian population be brought to a 'minimum.'<ref name=Lower>Lower, 2005, introduction.</ref></blockquote>

During 1942-1949 Zhytomyr region was a territory of mild [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] (UPA) activity (UPA North), who fought for Independence of Ukraine against [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Soviet Union]].

After [[Soviet Union]] defeated [[Nazi Germany]], Zhytomyr fell under Soviet rule and became a part of [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] again.

On 24 August 1991 Ukrainian parliament announced [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine]]. From 1991, Zhytomyr has been part of the independent and sovereign [[Ukraine]].

According to a survey conducted by the [[International Republican Institute]] in April–May 2023, 82% of the city's population spoke Ukrainian at home, and 14% spoke Russian.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ratinggroup.ua/files/ratinggroup/reg_files/municipal_survey_may_2023_ua_-_final.pdf|access-date=2023-08-22|title=Восьме всеукраїнське муніципальне опитування|language=uk}}</ref>

=== Roman Catholics ===
Zhytomyr had been a Latin Catholic bishopric since 1321, until The See was suppressed in 1789 in favor of the [[Diocese of Lutsk and Zytomierz]], until that was split up again in 1925, when it was restored as the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Zhytomyr]]; that was formally suppressed in 1998 to establish the [[Diocese of Kyïv–Žytomyr]], but actually the city retains the episcopal see in its Cathedral of the [[Holy Wisdom]], while [[Kyiv]] (although first in the title and the national capital) only has a [[co-cathedral]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/zyto0.htm|title=Diocese of Žytomyr|website=GCatholic}}</ref>

The Zhytomyr cemetery was opened in 1800. At first, it served Polish nobility from [[Volhynia]], such as the Czeczel and the Woronicz families. Later, other Catholics were buried here, including Germans, Ukrainians and Russians.

In 1840, the Chapel of St. Stanislaus was built (now in ruins), and the cemetery was divided into nine districts, named after different saints. In the [[Soviet Union]], the complex was devastated, now it is under the process of renovation.

Among most famous people buried here are: 
* Bronislaw Matyjewicz-Maciejewicz, one of the first Polish air pilots
* Karol Niedzialkowski - bishop of Lutsk and Zhytomir in the late 19th century
* Apolinary Wnukowski - Roman Catholic archbishop and scholar
* Juliusz Zarębski - Polish composer
* parents of [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]]
* the family of [[Stanisław Moniuszko]]

=== Jews in Zhytomyr ===
[[File:Zhitomir Jewish Institute.JPG|thumb|Zhytomyr Jewish Institute building]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
Zhytomyr apparently had few [[Jew]]s at the time of the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] (1648), but by the time it became part of [[Russia]] in 1778, it had a large Jewish community, and was a center of the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] movement. Jews formed nearly one-third of the 1861 population (13,299 of 40,564); thirty years later, they had somewhat outpaced the general growth of the city, with 24,062 Jews in a total population of 69,785. By 1891 there were three large [[synagogue]]s and 46 smaller ''[[Beth midrash|batei midrash]]''. The proportion of Jews was much lower in the surrounding district of Zhytomyr than in the city itself; at the turn of the century (circa 1900) there were 22,636 Jews in a total population of 281,378.

In [[Imperial Russia]], Zhytomyr held the same status as the official Jewish center of southern part of the [[Pale of Settlement]] as [[Vilnius]] held in the north. The printing of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] books was permitted only in these two cities during the monopoly of Hebrew printing from 1845 to 1862, and both were chosen as the seats of the two [[rabbi]]nical schools which were established by the government in 1848 in pursuance of its plans to force secular education on the [[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union|Jews of Russia]] in accordance with the program of the Teutonized Russian [[Haskalah]] movement. The rabbinical school of Zhytomyr was considered the more Jewish, or rather the less Russianized, of the two (''[[Ha-Meliẓ]]'', 1868, No. 40, cited in ''Jewish Encyclopedia''). Its first head master was [[Jacob Eichenbaum]], who was succeeded by [[Hayyim Selig Slonimski]] in 1862. The latter remained at the head of the school until it was closed (together with the one at Vilnius) in 1873 because of its failure to provide rabbis with a secular education who would be acceptable to the Jewish communities. [[Suchastover]], [[Gottlober]], [[Lerner (rabbi)|Lerner]], and [[Zweifel (rabbi)|Zweifel]] were among the best-known teachers of the rabbinical school at Zhytomyr, while [[Abraham Goldfaden]], [[Salomon Mandelkern]], and [[Abraham Jacob Paperna]] were among the students who later became famous in the Jewish world.

The Jewish community of Zhytomyr suffered [[pogrom]]s:
#On 7–8 May 1905, when the section of the city known as "Podol" was devastated, and 20 were killed within the city.
#On 7–10 January 1919, 15 young Jewish neighbors were killed when they came to defend, and the [[Christianity|Christian]] student Nicholas Blinov, also attempting to defend, likewise died. Ten young Jews from nearby [[Chudnov]] were also killed while on their way to aid the Jews of Zhytomyr.<ref name="bh.org.il">{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Zhitomir |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/zhitomir |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}</ref>
#Beginning on 22 March 1919, according to witnesses, the 317 deaths were fewer than might have been, due to both Christian sheltering efforts and the return of the [[Bolshevik]] troops within a few days.<ref>Elias Heifetz, ''The slaughter of the Jews in the Ukraine in 1919'', 1921, Thomas Selzter New York, pp. 25-40. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gSkEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR5] accessed October 28, 2009</ref>

The Jewish community of the region was largely destroyed in [[the Holocaust]]. In the four months beginning with [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]]'s 25 July 1942 orders, "all of Ukraine's [[shtetl]]s and [[ghetto#Second World War|ghettos]] lay in ruins; around 3,000<ref>{{Cite book|title=Les Einsatzgruppen : les groupes d'intervention et la genèse de la Solution finale (impr. 2007)|last=Ogorreck|first= Ralf|publisher=Le Grand livre du mois|others=Mannoni, Olivier, 1960- ..., Impr.

Today, the Zhytomyr Jewish community numbers about 5,000. The community is a part of the "Union of Jewish Communities in Ukraine" and the city and district's rabbinate. Rabbi Shlomo Vilhelm, who came to the city as a [[Chabad emissary]] in 1994, serves as rabbi. Other Jewish institutions are also active in the city, including the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee|Joint]] and its humanitarian branch "Chesed" and the [[Jewish Agency]].

The community has an ancient [[synagogue]] in the city center which has a [[mikveh]]. [[Chabad]] operates in the city various educational institutions which have residence in a village next to the city.

[[File:Panorama-2008-05-20-teteriv.jpg|thumb|Teteriv River in Zhytomyr]]
Zhytomyr lies in a unique natural setting; all sides of the city are surrounded by ancient [[forest]]s through which flow the [[Teteriv River|Teteriv]], Kamianka, Kroshenka and Putiatynka [[river]]s. The Teteriv river generally forms the southern boundary of Zhytomyr, though there are also some small areas of Zhytomyr city territory below the southern bank of the river. The city is rich in [[parks]] and [[public square]]s.

Zhytomyr is set out on a mostly radial type of [[street]] net with the centre at the main public square of the city, named ''Sobornyi Maidan'' (which means ''Cathedral Square''). A building containing [[court]]s and some other institutions is in the west of the square. Before 1991, this building contained Zhytomyr Oblast Committee of the [[CPSU|Communist Party]]. Just behind the building (that is to the west of Sobornyi Square) is a small quiet park, bearing the name of ''Zamkova Gora'' (''Castle Mountain'') and containing a monument-type boulder with an inscription stating that this is a place where Zhytomyr was founded. This historical centre of Zhytomyr is in the south part of the city. The old part of Zhytomyr is on three rocky hills over the river Kamianka: Okhrimova, Zamkova, and Petrovska.

The old town is surrounded by new housing estates, the names of which are often borrowed from the former suburban villages or reflect the longstanding occupations common in these places. The main streets connecting Sobornyi Maidan with the outskirts of Zhytomyr are Kyivska Street or [[Kyiv]] Street (going to northeast, to the [[railway station]] and also to the main [[bus station]] of the city), Velyka [[Berdychiv]]ska Street (going to [[Cardinal direction|southeast]]), [[Lech Kaczyński]] Street (going southwest; its further continuation is [[Chudniv]]ska Street going to [[beach]]es and a forest-type park near the river of Teteriv), and Peremohy Street (going north).

The best-known street in the central part of Zhytomyr is Mykhailivska (named after [[St. Michael]]'s [[Church (building)|Church]] at the northern end of the street).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://zhytomyr-future.com.ua/uk/istoriya-golovnoyi-vulyczi-zhytomyra-myhajlivskoyi|title=Історія головної вулиці Житомира – Михайлівської}}</ref> The street is about 500 [[metre]]s to the east of Sobornyi Maidan and runs approximately from north to south, connecting some points at the above-mentioned Kyivska Street and Velyka Berdychivska. Mykhailivska Street is for [[pedestrian]] traffic: [[vehicle]]s are forbidden, with the exception of some slow-moving ones. A puppet theatre is nestled in the middle of the street, while the building of the Zhytomyr City Council is at its southern end. Several small coffee houses and cafés have sprung up here recently, frequented by locals from all walks of life and of all ages. If one crosses Velyka Berdychivska Street from the southern end of Mykhailivska Street, then one finds oneself at [[Sergey Korolyov|Korolyov]] Square containing the building of the Zhytomyr Oblast Council. Crossing Kyivska Street from the northern end of Mykhailivska Street, one can continue to go along Pokrovska Street, another important long avenue of Zhytomyr (going north).

The best-known park of Zhytomyr is named after [[Yuri Gagarin]], in the south of the city, at the left (northern) bank of the Teteriv River. It was formerly owned by the [[Maximilien Chaudoir|Baron de Chaudoir]].

== Economy ==
[[File:P1160751 Центральний універмаг.jpg|thumb|Zhytomyr central department store]]
Zhytomyr is an important economic center in the region. Enterprises in the city include glass, metal fabrication, electronic devices, screens, fabrics, furniture, shoes and others.
In addition, there is a large pharmaceutical factory in Zhytomyr. Since 1944, a confectionery factory (ALC "ZhL") has operated in Zhytomyr; the enterprise is one of the leaders of the Ukrainian confectionery market.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sladosti.com.ua/factory/company/history/|title=История &#124; ЖЛ|website=www.sladosti.com.ua|access-date=2014-06-01|archive-date=2014-06-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605052056/http://www.sladosti.com.ua/factory/company/history/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The city is home to the Zhytomyr Armored Factory. The factory has been one of the main repair facilities in Ukraine since the start of the [[Russo-Ukrainian War]], running on 3 shifts. In September 2014 it was announced that the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine had placed a ₴280 million order with the factory.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ukrinform.ua/rus/news/gitomirskiy_bronetankoviy_poluchil_goszakaz_na_280_millionov_1668882|publisher=Ukrinform|title="Житомирский бронетанковый" получил госзаказ на 280 миллионов}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.liga.net/news/politics/3678736-ukrainskoy_armii_zakazali_trinadtsat_vertoletov_mi_8.htm|publisher=Liga|title=Украинской армии заказали тринадцать вертолетов Ми-8|date=14 October 2014}}</ref>

== Transport ==
[[File:Zhitomir Pushkinskaya Street.JPG|thumb|Pushkinska Street]]
[[File:Zhytomyr Chudnivskiy bridge.jpg|thumb|Chudnivskyi bridge]]
In ancient times, the city was on the important road from [[Kyiv]] to the city of [[Brest, Belarus|Brest-Litovsk]]. 
Now this road is of international highway {{Jct|country=UKR|M|06}} {{jct|country=EUR|E|40 }} connecting [[Kyiv]] to the Hungarian border near [[Chop, Ukraine|Chop]].<br />
Some other roads:
* {{Jct|country=UKR|M|21}} {{jct|country=EUR|E|583 }} connecting the cities [[Roman, Romania|Roman]] and Zhytomyr (through [[Vinnytsia]])
* {{Jct|country=UKR|H|03}} Zhytomyr - [[Chernivtsi]] (through [[Khmelnytskyi]])
* {{Road marker simple|Road P18 (Ukraine)|P18|white|black|black}} Zhytomyr - [[Stavyshche]] (through [[Skvyra]])
* {{Road marker simple|Road P28 (Ukraine)|P28|white|black|black}} Zhytomyr - checkpoint "Vystupovychi" of the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]]-[[Belarus]]ian border (through [[Korosten]]).
<br />
[[Railways]] connect [[Koziatyn]] with Zhytomyr (through [[Berdychiv]]), [[Korosten]], [[Zviahel]], [[Korostyshiv]] and [[Fastiv]]. In 2011 a stretch of the [[Fastiv]] — Zhytomyr rail line was electrified.<br />
Zhytomyr is about 131 kilometers from [[Kyiv]] (by road 140&nbsp;km, by rail 165&nbsp;km).

The following trains pass through Zhytomyr train station (both directions for all):{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
* Zhytomyr - [[Korosten]]
* [[Vinnytsia]] - [[Korosten]]
* Zhytomyr - [[Korostyshiv]]
* [[Korosten]] - [[Koziatyn]]
* Zhytomyr - [[Koziatyn]]
* Zhytomyr - [[Zviahel]]
* Zhytomyr - [[Fastiv]]

The city has an airport (however, it is not currently being used for passenger transport; it is intended for the use of strategic bombers, though not currently being used).

Zhytomyr has three bus stations connecting it with many other cities and villages in [[Ukraine]] and abroad.<br />
Zhytomyr has fifteen bridges and junctions built over rivers and roads. There is a 30-kilometer ring road around Zhytomyr.
The most interesting bridge in Zhytomyr is one over the [[Teteriv River]] in Gagarin Park (named after [[Yuri Gagarin]]).

=== Public city transport ===
Common kinds of [[public transport]] shuttling within Zhytomyr are [[trolleybus]]es, [[bus]]es, and [[minibus]]es. There are also electric [[tram]]s, but on one route only. Earlier there were several tram routes in Zhytomyr, but all excepting one were canceled during a period of domination of the opinion that a tram is a bad kind of [[transport]].
Trams began to shuttle in Zhytomyr in 1899. Thus Zhytomyr became the 5th city with electric trams within the territory of present-day [[Ukraine]]. Trolleybuses appear in Zhytomyr in 1962.
The total length of Zhytomyr city electric transport routes (trolleybuses and trams) is 275&nbsp;km. Zhytomyr is the first city in Ukraine to implement e-ticket system in all municipal public transport.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}
