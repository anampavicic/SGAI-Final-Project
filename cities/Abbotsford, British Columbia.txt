The community of {{convert|375.55|km2}} is the [[List of the largest cities and towns in Canada by area|largest city by area]] in British Columbia. The municipality's southern boundary is the Canada–United States border. In Canada, it is bordered by the [[Langley, British Columbia (district municipality)|Township of Langley]] to the west, the [[Mission, British Columbia|City of Mission]] to the north, and the City of [[Chilliwack]] to the east. Abbotsford borders the town of [[Sumas, Washington]], to the south. Much of Abbotsford has views of [[Mount Baker]] (to the southeast, in Washington) and the [[Coast Mountains]] (to the north).

== History ==
===Settlement===
The first residents of the area are the [[Stó:lō Nation]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |url=https://www.missionmuseum.com/local-history/stolo/ |title=Sto:lo |website=Mission Museum |access-date=March 3, 2020 |archive-date=March 3, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200303012834/https://www.missionmuseum.com/local-history/stolo/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> The '''Upper Sumas 6''' [[Indian reserve]] of the [[Sumas First Nation]] is located at Kilgard within Abbotsford city limits.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/bcgnws/names/64610.html |title=BC Geographical Names |website=apps.gov.bc.ca}}</ref>

European settlement began when the [[Royal Engineers]] surveyed the area in response to the [[gold rush]] along the [[Fraser River]] in 1858. This led to the building of Yale Road (today [[Old Yale Road]]), the first transportation route to link the [[Fraser Valley]]. The settlement grew and the production of butter, milk and tobacco began by the late 1860s. In 1889, former Royal Engineer John Cunningham Maclure applied for a Crown grant to obtain the {{convert|160|acre|km2}} that would become Abbotsford.

The Gur Sikh Temple, located on 33089 South Fraser Way, is the oldest Sikh temple in North America. Built in 1908 and opened in 1911, it is now over 110 years old, outlasting the now demolished 2nd Avenue temple in Vancouver (opened in 1908),<ref>{{cite web |title=The Reach |url=https://thereach.pastperfectonline.com/photo/9C750672-4602-4D7A-95F6-153908429876 |website=thereach.pastperfectonline.com |access-date=May 12, 2019}}</ref> and the [[Golden, British Columbia|Golden]] temple (opened in 1905) which was destroyed by fire.<ref name="goldentemple" />

=== Contemporary period  ===
[[File:Downtownabbotsford.JPG|thumb|left|Downtown Abbotsford]]
The title passed hands to Robert Ward, who filed a townsite subdivision on July 9, 1891. Also in 1891, the CPR built a railway line through the area that connected [[Mission, British Columbia|Mission]] with the [[Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway]] at [[Sumas, Washington]]. This route was the only rail connection between [[Vancouver]] and [[Seattle]] until 1904. The Village of Abbotsford was incorporated in 1892. At that time Robert Ward sold many of the lots to private investors, but also sold off a significant portion to the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]]'s subsidiary company the [[Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway]]. The [[British Columbia Electric Railway]] (BCER) arrived in 1910. The Interurban, as the BCER tram linking Abbotsford with Vancouver and [[Chilliwack]] was called, was discontinued in 1950, but BCER's successor [[BC Hydro]] retains the right to re-introduce passenger rail service. Service to Vancouver runs from neighbouring Mission by way of the [[West Coast Express]].

The most notable natural disaster to hit Abbotsford was [[Fraser River flood of 1948|a major flood]] of the [[Fraser River]] in 1948.

In September 1984, [[Pope John Paul II]] held an open-air Mass for over 200,000 people at [[Abbotsford International Airport]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abbotsfordairport.ca/Page3457.aspx |title=Abbotsford Airport – Airport History |work=abbotsfordairport.ca |access-date=July 22, 2013 |archive-date=July 22, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180722130013/https://www.abbotsfordairport.ca/Page3457.aspx |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The amalgamation of the Village of Abbotsford and the [[District of Sumas]] into the District of Abbotsford occurred in 1972. The District of Abbotsford amalgamated with the [[District of Matsqui]] in 1995 to become the City of Abbotsford, raising the population significantly.

In June 2013, the City of Abbotsford spread chicken manure on a homeless camp located in the city.<ref>{{cite web |last=Jackson |first=Emily |title=Homeless Residents to Sue Abbotsford for Chicken Manure Incident |publisher=Metro Vancouver |date=November 26, 2013 |url=http://metronews.ca/news/vancouver/866870/homeless-residents-to-sue-abbotsford-for-chicken-manure-incident/ | access-date = June 5, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150724173231/http://metronews.ca/news/vancouver/866870/homeless-residents-to-sue-abbotsford-for-chicken-manure-incident/ | archive-date = July 24, 2015 | url-status = dead}}</ref> Abbotsford Mayor [[Bruce Banman]] publicly apologized for the incident.<ref>{{cite web |last=Woo |first=Andrea |title=Homeless group set to sue Abbotsford for harassment |work=The Globe and Mail |date=July 24, 2013 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/homeless-people-suing-abbotsford-bc-over-manure-dumping/article13395996/}}</ref>

==Government==
[[File:HPIM0946 edited.JPG|thumb|right|Abbotsford City Hall]]
[[Abbotsford City Council]] comprises a [[council-manager]] form of local government. The mayor and council were last elected [[2022 British Columbia municipal elections|in 2022]]. The current mayor is [[Ross Siemens]].

The Abbotsford flag and coat of arms are the same, featuring straight, diagonal crosses representing Abbotsford as at a "crossroads". At the centre is a strawberry blossom to symbolize the local berry industry. The flag of Abbotsford was originally blue in colour. The change to green was initiated in 1995 when the District of Abbotsford and the District of Matsqui amalgamated to create the City of Abbotsford.

==Sports==
=== Hockey ===
Abbotsford Minor Hockey is one of the largest associations in British Columbia, with more than 1,000 players registered from the ages of 5 through 18 years old. This association is recognized by many as a model and a leader in the development of minor hockey programs, and several Abbotsford-raised players have gone on to the highest levels of this sport. In the 2005–06 hockey season, Abbotsford's bantam AAA team were ultimately the Western Canadian Bantam Champions, and eight individual players from this team (the most ever) were selected in the 2006 WHL Bantam Draft.

The [[Abbotsford Pilots]] of the [[Pacific International Junior Hockey League]] (junior B level) play at MSA Arena, which is Abbotsford's second largest arena at just over 400 seats. Abbotsford was considered as a possible home for the [[Chilliwack Chiefs (1990–2006)|Chilliwack Chiefs]] (junior A), who were forced to move in 2006 when the [[Chilliwack Bruins]] (a WHL expansion team) took over their arena, Prospera Centre. Abbotsford would have become the home of the Chiefs if the city had supported them in building a new arena; instead, the Chiefs moved to Langley. Construction has now been completed in Abbotsford on a far bigger sports and entertainment centre (with 7,500 seats).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sporttowncanada.com/ |title=Abbotsford sports website |website=Sporttowncanada.com |access-date=March 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827171055/http://www.sporttowncanada.com/ |archive-date=August 27, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The City of Abbotsford has its own municipal police force, one of eleven municipal police forces in British Columbia. It is the third-largest municipal police force in British Columbia (behind Vancouver and [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]). {{as of|2006}}, the Abbotsford Police Department employed nearly 200 officers and 80 civilian employees.

The Abbotsford Police Department was officially formed in 1995 when the District of Matsqui and the District of Abbotsford amalgamated to become the City of Abbotsford. Prior to the amalgamation, the District of Matsqui was patrolled by the Matsqui police and the District of Abbotsford by the RCMP. During the referendum citizens elected to keep a municipal police force.
