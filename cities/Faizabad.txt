'''Faizabad''' (Hindustani pronunciation: [[Help:IPA/Hindi and Urdu|[fɛːzaːbaːd]]]) is a city located in [[Ayodhya district]] in the Indian state of [[Uttar Pradesh]].  It is situated on the southern bank of the [[Ghaghara|River Saryu]] about 6.5 km from [[Ayodhya|Ayodhya City]], the district headquarter, 130 km east of the state capital [[Lucknow]]. Faizabad was the first capital of the [[Nawabs of Awadh]] and has monuments built by those Nawabs, like the [[Bahu Begum ka Maqbara|Tomb of Bahu Begum]], [[Gulab Bari]]. It was also the headquarters of Faizabad district (now [[Ayodhya district]]) and Faizabad division (now [[Ayodhya division]]) before November 2018.<ref>{{cite web |title=UP cabinet approves renaming of Faizabad as Ayodhya |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/up-cabinet-approves-renaming-of-faizabad-as-ayodhya-allahabad-as-prayagraj/articleshow/66605791.cms |publisher=[[India Today]] |author=PTI |date=6 November 2018 |access-date=24 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ayodhya.nic.in/about-district/|title=About District {{!}} District Ayodhya - Government of Uttar Pradesh|website=District Ayodhya - Government of Uttar Pradesh}}</ref> Faizabad is a twin city of [[Ayodhya]] and it is administered by [[Ayodhya Municipal Corporation]].

According to ''[[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]]'', "[w]hen [[:Saadat Ali Khan I|Saadat Khan]] was appointed governor of [[Oudh State|Oudh]] he built a hunting lodge 4 miles west of [[Ayodhya]] [in 1730<ref name=faizabad.nic.in/>], then the head-quarters of the province.  Gardens were laid out and shops sprang up in the neighbourhood, and during the time of his successor [[Safdar Jang]] the name Faizabad was first applied.  [[Shuja-ud-Daula|Shuja-ud-daula]], the third Nawab, lived chiefly at [[:Lucknow]] during the early part of his reign; but after his defeat at [[Battle of Buxar|Buxar in 1764]] he made Faizabad his residence, and during the remainder of his life added largely to its defences and also laid a large town.  Shuja-ud-daula died early in 1775, and before the close of the year [[:Asaf-ud-Daula|Asaf-ud-daula]] moved permanently to Lucknow. The importance of Faizabad declined, but it remained the home of Asaf-ud-daula's grandmother and mother, the Nawab Begam and Bahu Begam, whose treatment was the subject of charges against [[Warren Hastings]].  After the death of Bahu Begam in 1816 Faizabad decayed still farther".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?volume=12&objectid=DS405.1.I34_V12_001.gif |section-url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?volume=12&objectid=DS405.1.I34_V12_123.gif|title=Imperial Gazetteer of India |volume=12 |section=Fyzabad |page=117 |date=1908}}</ref> Oudh State was annexed by the British in 1856.

=== Establishment of Princely state of Awadh ===
Gulab Bari stands in a garden surrounded by a wall, approachable through two large gateways. These buildings are particularly interesting for their assimilative architectural styles. Shuja-ud-daula's wife was the well known Bahu Begum, who married the Nawab in 1743 and continued to reside in Faizabad, her residence being the Moti-Mahal. Close by at Jawaharbagh lies her Maqbara, where she was buried after her death in 1816. It is considered to be one of the finest buildings of its kind in Avadh, which was built at the cost of three lakh rupees by her chief advisor Darab Ali Khan. A fine view of the city is obtainable from top of the begum's tomb. Bahu Begum was a woman of great distinction and rank, bearing dignity. Most of the Muslim buildings of Faizabad are attributed to her. From the date of Bahu Begum's death in 1815 until the annexation of Avadh, the city of Faizabad gradually fell into decay. The glory of Faizabad finally eclipsed with the shifting of capital from Faizabad to Lucknow by Nawab [[Asaf-ud-daula]].<ref name=faizabad.nic.in>{{cite web|url=http://faizabad.nic.in/history.htm|title=Welcome to Faizabad History|publisher=official website of Faizabad district|access-date=29 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228201603/http://faizabad.nic.in/history.htm|archive-date=28 December 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Faizabad was also a centre of one of many battles of the Mutiny of 1857. A detailed history of Faizabad can be read in 'Tareekh-e-Farahbaksh', written by Munshi Mohd. Faiz Baksh, (after whom Faizabad is named) a courtier in the Shuja-ud-Daula's court. This book has been translated into English by Hamid Afaq Qureshi as 'Memoirs of Faizabad'. Faizabad also finds a prominent and detailed mention in ''[[Guzashta Lucknow]]'' written by [[Abdul Halim Sharar]]. The fourth nawab of Awadh, Nawab [[Asaf-ud-Daula]], shifted the Capital of Avadh to Lucknow in 1775 after his terms with his mother became sour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myuttarpradesh.co.in/faizabad.html|title=History of Faizabad|publisher=myuttarpradesh.co.in/|access-date=29 June 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701141026/http://www.myuttarpradesh.co.in/faizabad.html|archive-date=1 July 2012}}</ref>
