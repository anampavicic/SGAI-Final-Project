==History==
{{main|History of Nottingham}}
{{see also|Timeline of Nottingham}}
[[File:Nottingham Castle gatehouse 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nottingham Castle]]]]
[[Nottingham Castle]] was constructed in 1068 on a [[sandstone]] outcrop by the [[River Leen]].

The early history of Nottingham dates back to 919 A.D. where [[Edward the Elder|King Edward the Elder]] captured Nottingham to which he built a fortress on the southern bank of the river Trent in 921 A.D. During the [[Norman Conquest]] [[William the Conqueror|King William the Conqueror]] built a castle in Nottingham which was entrusted to [[William Peverel]].<ref name="Cornelius Brown 1896">Cornelius Brown, ''A History of Nottinghamshire'' (1896), retrieved on 3 June 2023</ref>

The Anglo-Saxon settlement was originally confined to the area today known as the Lace Market and was surrounded by a substantial defensive ditch and rampart, which fell out of use following the Norman Conquest and was filled by the time of the [[Domesday Book]] (1086).<ref name="Scott C. Lomax 2013 pp. 83">Scott C. Lomax (17 October 2013). Nottingham: The Buried Past of a Historic City Revealed. Pen and Sword. pp. 83–. {{ISBN|978-1-4738-2999-2}}.</ref> Following the Norman Conquest the Saxon settlement developed into the English [[Borough]] of Nottingham and housed a Town Hall and Law Courts. A settlement also developed around the castle on the hill opposite and was the French borough supporting the Normans in the castle. Eventually, the space between was built on as the town grew and the [[Old Market Square]] became the focus of Nottingham several centuries later.<ref name="Scott C. Lomax 2013 pp. 83"/> Defences consisted initially of a ditch and bank in the early 12th century. The ditch was later widened, in the mid-13th century, and a stone wall built around much of the perimeter of the town. A short length of the wall survives, and is visible at the northern end of Maid Marian Way, and is protected as a Scheduled Monument.<ref name="Scott C. Lomax 2013 pp. 83"/>

[[File:Nottingham Castle South Front.jpg|thumb|Nottingham Castle]]

On the return of [[Richard I of England|King Richard the Lionheart]] from the [[Third Crusade|Crusades]] in 1194, the castle was occupied by supporters of [[John, King of England|Prince John]], including the [[Sheriff of Nottingham (position)|Sheriff of Nottingham]]. It was besieged by Richard and, after a sharp conflict, was captured.<ref>Thomas Chambers Hine (1876) ''Nottingham Castle; Nottingham, Eng. Museum and Art Gallery''. London:Hamilton, Adams & co.</ref>{{better source needed|date=March 2024}} In the legends of [[Robin Hood]], Nottingham Castle is the scene of the final showdown between the Sheriff and the hero outlaw.<ref>{{cite news|title=Robin Hood pardoned by Sheriff of Nottingham |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-25004289 |issue=20 November 2013 |publisher=BBC News |date=10 May 2015 |access-date=21 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181217070013/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-25004289 |archive-date=17 December 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> [[John, King of England|King John of England]] (formerly Prince John) visited Nottingham in 1199 and 1202.

By the 15th century Nottingham had established itself as a centre of a thriving export trade in religious sculpture made from [[Nottingham alabaster]].<ref>Medieval English Alabaster Carvings in the Castle Museum Nottingham, [[Francis Cheetham]], City of Nottingham art Galleries and Museums Committee, 1973</ref> During the late medieval period Nottingham alabasters were exported as far afield as Iceland, and may be one reason why a small number of Icelandic immigrants lived in Nottingham during the 15th century.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Out of the Land of Ice and Fire: Icelandic Immigrants in the Midlands During the Fifteenth Century|journal=Midland History|date=2023 |doi=10.1080/0047729X.2023.2217231 |last1=Lomax |first1=Scott C. |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=158–175 |s2cid=259773316 |doi-access=free }}</ref> The town became a [[county corporate]] in 1449<ref>A Centenary history of Nottingham. J. V. Beckett</ref> giving it effective self-government, in the words of the charter, "for eternity". The Castle and Shire Hall were expressly excluded and remained as detached Parishes of [[Nottinghamshire]].

One of those highly impressed by Nottingham in the late 18th century was the German traveller [[Karl Philipp Moritz|C. P. Moritz]], who wrote in 1782, "Of all the towns I have seen outside London, Nottingham is the loveliest and neatest. Everything had a modern look, and a large space in the centre was hardly less handsome than a London square. A charming footpath leads over the fields to the highway, where a bridge spans the Trent. … Nottingham … with its high houses, red roofs and church steeples, looks excellent from a distance."<ref>Carl Philip Moritz: ''[[Journeys of a German in England in 1782]]'', tr. and ed. Reginald Nettel (New York, NY: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc., 1965), pp. 176–77.</ref>

During the [[Industrial Revolution]], much of Nottingham's prosperity was founded on the [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|textile industry]]; in particular, the city became an internationally important centre of [[lace]] manufacture. In 1831 citizens rioted in protest against the [[Duke of Newcastle]]'s opposition to the [[Reform Act 1832]], setting fire to his residence on the site of Nottingham Castle.

[[File:Nottingham Map 1831 by Staveley and Wood.jpg|thumb|Nottingham in 1831]]

In common with the UK textile industry, Nottingham's textile sector fell into decline in the decades following the [[Second World War]].<ref>Cite Web University of Nottingham, Manuscripts and Special Collections, Textiles Lace & Hosiery https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/manuscriptsandspecialcollections/collectionsindepth/businessrecords/textiles-lace--hosiery.aspx retrieved on 4 June 2023</ref> Little textile manufacture now takes place in Nottingham; however, many of the former industrial buildings in the Lace Market district have been restored and put to new uses.

Nottingham was one of the boroughs reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], and at that time consisted of the parishes of St Mary, St Nicholas and St Peter. It was expanded in 1877 by adding the parishes of [[Basford, Nottingham|Basford]], Brewhouse Yard, [[Bulwell]], [[Radford, Nottingham|Radford]], [[Sneinton]], Standard Hill, and parts of the parishes of [[West Bridgford]], [[Carlton, Nottinghamshire|Carlton]], [[Wilford, Nottinghamshire|Wilford]] (North Wilford). In 1889 Nottingham became a [[county borough]] under the [[Local Government Act 1888]]. City status was awarded as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of Queen Victoria, being signified in a letter from the prime minister, the [[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]] to the mayor, dated 18 June 1897. Nottingham was extended in 1933 by adding [[Bilborough]] and [[Wollaton]], parts of the parishes of Bestwood Park and [[Colwick]], and a recently developed part of the [[Beeston Urban District]]. A further boundary extension was granted in 1951 when Clifton and Wilford (south of the River Trent) were incorporated into the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10001389&c_id=10001043 |title=Relationships / unit history of Nottingham |access-date=22 March 2007 |publisher=A Vision of Britain Through Time |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930235913/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10001389&c_id=10001043 |archive-date=30 September 2007}}</ref><ref name=localhist>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/nottingham.html |title=A Brief History of Nottingham, England |first=Tim |last=Lambert |access-date=12 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622224124/http://www.localhistories.org/nottingham.html |archive-date=22 June 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>

During the second half of the 20th century Nottingham saw urban growth with the development of new public and private housing estates and new urban centres, which have engulfed former rural villages such as Bilborough, Wollaton, Gedling and Bramcote. South of the river there has also been expansion with new areas such as Edwalton and West Bridgford, adding to Nottingham's [[urban sprawl]]. Although this growth slowed towards the end of the century, the modern pressures for more affordable and council housing is back on the political agenda and there is now pressure on the [[green belt]] which surrounds the city.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hess |first=John |title=Green Belt is Threatened by Housing Rush Warns Notts MP |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-15358365 |publisher=BBC News |date=18 October 2011 |access-date=14 January 2021 |archive-date=20 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210120234654/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-15358365 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Government==

===Local government===
[[File:Council-House-Nottingham.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nottingham Council House]]]]

[[Nottingham City Council]] is a [[unitary authority]], and is based at [[Loxley House, Nottingham|Loxley House]] on Station Street. It consists of 55 [[councillors]], representing 20 [[Ward (politics)|wards]], who are elected every four years; the last elections being held on [[2019 Nottingham City Council election|2 May 2019]]. The council is independent of [[Nottinghamshire County Council]] but work with them for local developments and other matters. Nottingham, though, remains the county town of Nottinghamshire even though [[County Hall, Nottinghamshire|the county hall]] is in the neighbouring town of [[West Bridgford]] where the county council is based.

[[File:Station Street, Nottingham - geograph.org.uk - 1580251.jpg|thumb|[[Loxley House, Nottingham]]]]

The city also has a [[Lord Mayor of Nottingham|Lord Mayor]] who is selected by city councillors from among themselves. The position is largely ceremonial but the Lord Mayor also acts as Chair of Full Council meetings.

The City of Nottingham's boundaries are tightly drawn and exclude several suburbs and towns that are usually considered part of [[Greater Nottingham]]. Unlike the city, these areas are governed by a two tier system of local government. Nottinghamshire County Council is based at the county hall. It provides the upper tier of local government whilst the lower tier is split into several district or borough councils. The County Council are responsible for Health, Social Care, Education, Highways, Transport, Libraries and Trading Standards, whilst the lower tier councils are responsible for local planning, neighbourhood services, housing, licensing, environmental health and leisure facilities. The towns of [[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston]], [[Stapleford, Nottinghamshire|Stapleford]] and [[Eastwood, Nottinghamshire|Eastwood]] are administered by [[Broxtowe Borough Council]]. Further west still, the Nottingham urban district extends into [[Derbyshire]] where [[Ilkeston]] and [[Long Eaton]] are administered by [[Erewash Borough Council]], and [[Ripley, Derbyshire|Ripley]] by [[Amber Valley]]. To the north, [[Hucknall]] is governed by [[Ashfield District Council]], while in the east [[Arnold, Nottinghamshire|Arnold]] and [[Carlton, Nottinghamshire|Carlton]] form part of the [[Borough of Gedling]]. South of the river, the town of [[West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire|West Bridgford]] lies in [[Rushcliffe]], as do the outlying villages of [[Ruddington]] and [[Tollerton, Nottinghamshire|Tollerton]] and the town of [[Bingham, Nottinghamshire|Bingham]].
[[File:GreaterNottingham-map.png|thumb|Map illustrating the boundaries of the city and the wider [[Greater Nottingham]] area]]

===UK Parliament===
Nottingham has three UK parliamentary [[constituency]] seats within its boundaries. [[Nottingham North (UK Parliament constituency)|Nottingham North]] has been represented since 2017 by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) [[Alex Norris (British politician)|Alex Norris]], [[Nottingham East (UK Parliament constituency)|Nottingham East]] since 2019 by Labour MP [[Nadia Whittome]] and [[Nottingham South (UK Parliament constituency)|Nottingham South]] since 2010 by Labour MP [[Lilian Greenwood]]. Each of the outer districts (Broxtowe, Ashfield, Gedling and Rushcliffe) are also parliamentary constituencies in their own right although the parliamentary constituency boundaries do not align with the boundaries of the council districts of which they share their name.

===Climate===
{{main|Climate of Nottingham}}
Like most of the United Kingdom, Nottingham has a [[Oceanic climate|temperate oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: Cfb) and experiences warm mild summers and mild to cool winters with abundant precipitation throughout the year.

==City centre==
{{see also|Nottingham city centre}}
The city centre of Nottingham is usually defined as the [[Old Market Square]]. The square is dominated by the [[Nottingham Council House|Council House]], which was built in the 1920s to replace the [[Nottingham Exchange]]. The Council House has [[baroque]] columns and two stone lion statues in the front to stand watch over the square. The [[Exchange Arcade]], on the ground floor, is a shopping centre.

[[File:Byron house 2.JPG|220px|thumb|Nottingham Trent University, Arkwright Building]]
Tall office buildings line Maid Marian Way. The Georgian area around Oxford and Regent Streets is dominated by small professional firms. The [[Albert Hall, Nottingham|Albert Hall]] faces the [[gothic revival architecture|Gothic revival]] [[Nottingham Cathedral|St Barnabas' Roman Catholic Cathedral]] by [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Pugin]]. [[Nottingham Castle]] and its grounds are located further south in the western third of the city. The central third descends from the university district in the north, past [[Nottingham Trent University]]'s Gothic revival Arkwright Building. The university also owns many other buildings in this area. The Theatre Royal on Theatre Square, with its pillared façade, was built in 1865. King and Queen Streets are home to striking [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] buildings designed by such architects as [[Alfred Waterhouse]] and [[Watson Fothergill]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Paris |first=Andrew |title=Watson Fothergill Buildings |url=https://www.watsonfothergill.co.uk/buildings/|accessdate=27 July 2023}}</ref>

The Canal-side to the south of the city is adjacent to [[Nottingham station|Nottingham railway station]] and home to multiple repurposed (as bars and restaurants) 19th-century industrial buildings.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

[[File:King_Street,_Nottingham_1.jpg|300px|thumb|King Street, Nottingham]]

The eastern third of the city contains [[Hockley Village]], with specialist and independent shops. The [[Victoria Centre]] is also in the area; it was built in the 1970s on the demolished [[Nottingham Victoria railway station|Victoria railway station]] site. All that remains of the old station is the station hotel and clock tower. The 250-foot-high Victoria Centre flats stand above the shopping centre and are [[List of tallest buildings and structures in Nottingham|the tallest buildings in the city]].

===Lace Market===
[[File:Lace market justice galleries.JPG|220px|thumb|National Justice Museum in the Lace Market]]
The [[Lace Market]] area just south of [[Hockley, Nottingham|Hockley]] has streets with four- to seven-storey red brick warehouses, [[iron railing]]s and [[Red telephone box|red phone boxes]].

Many of the buildings have been converted into apartments, bars and restaurants. The largest building in the Lace Market is the [[The Adams Building Nottingham|Adams Building]], built by [[Thomas Chambers Hine]] for [[Thomas Adams (manufacturer and philanthropist)|Thomas Adams]] (1807–1873), and currently used by [[Nottingham College]]. The Georgian-built Shire Hall, which was once Nottingham's main [[courtroom|court]] and [[prison]] building, is now home to the [[National Justice Museum]] (formerly the "Galleries of Justice").

===Public houses===
[[Ye Olde Trip To Jerusalem]] (the Trip), partially built into the cave system beneath Nottingham Castle, is a contender for the title of England's Oldest Pub, as it is supposed to have been established in 1189.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/entertainment/pubs/trip.shtml| title=Nottingham – Pubs| access-date=4 December 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621045656/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/entertainment/pubs/trip.shtml| archive-date=21 June 2014| url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem 03.jpg|thumb|[[Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem]]]]

[[The Bell Inn, Nottingham|The Bell Inn]] in the Old Market Square, and [[Ye Olde Salutation Inn]] (the Salutation) in Maid Marian Way have both disputed this claim. The Trip's current timber building probably dates back to the 17th or 18th century, but the caves are certainly older and may have been used to store beer and water for the castle during medieval times. There are also caves beneath the Salutation that date back to the medieval period, although they are no longer used as beer cellars. The Bell Inn is probably the oldest of the three pub buildings still standing, according to [[dendrochronology]], and has medieval cellars that are still used to store beer.<ref name="Lomax2013">{{cite book |first=Scott&nbsp;C. |last=Lomax |title=Nottingham: The Buried Past of a Historic City Revealed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vy8RBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT83 |date=17 October 2013 |publisher=Pen and Sword |isbn=978-1-4738-2999-2 |pages=83– |access-date=27 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108011808/https://books.google.com/books?id=Vy8RBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT83 |archive-date=8 January 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The city formerly had a major bicycle manufacturing industry sector.

[[File:The two closest football grounds in England (50285299147).png|thumb|[[Meadow Lane]] (left) and the [[City Ground]] (right) either side of the [[River Trent]], the two closest professional football grounds in England]]
Nottingham is home to two professional football clubs: [[EFL League Two]] club [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] and [[Premier League]] club [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. Their two football grounds, facing each other on opposite sides of the River Trent, are noted for geographically being the closest in English league football. Notts County, formed in 1862, is the oldest professional football club in the world.<ref>''Notts County – A Pictorial History'' by Paul Wain, page 8, {{ISBN|0-9547830-3-4}}</ref> It was also among the [[Football League]]'s founder members in 1888. For most of its history the team have played their home games at [[Meadow Lane]], which currently holds some 20,000 spectators, all seated. They currently play in League Two of the English Football League (most recently played at Level 1 in May 1992).<ref>{{fchd|id=NOTTSCO|name=Notts County}}</ref> Nottingham Forest, who currently play in the [[Premier League]], were Division One English League champions in 1978 and won the [[European Cup]] twice over the next two seasons under the management of [[Brian Clough]], who was the club's manager from January 1975 to May 1993, leading them to four [[Football League Cup]] triumphs in that time. They have played at the [[City Ground]], on the south bank of the [[River Trent]], since 1898. Nottingham Forest joined the Football League in 1892, four years after its inception when it merged with the rival [[Football Alliance]], and 100 years later, they were among the [[FA Premier League]]'s founder members in 1992—though they had not played top division football from May 1999 until their promotion from the Level 2 [[EFL Championship]] in the [[2021–22 EFL Championship|2021/2022 season]], 23 years later.<ref>{{fchd|id=NOTTINGF|name=Nottingham Forest}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Forest return to Premier League after 23-year wait |publisher=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61539298 |access-date=31 May 2022}}</ref> The [[City Ground]] played host to group stage games in the [[Euro 96|1996 European Football Championships]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Euro '96's forgotten city |url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/the-archive/1010-Euro-96/6902-euro-96s-forgotten-city |date=14 August 1996 |work=When Saturday Comes |access-date=10 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310230309/http://www.wsc.co.uk/the-archive/1010-Euro-96/6902-euro-96s-forgotten-city |archive-date=10 March 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Nottingham was an important interchange for many railways and mineral lines which served the city, its suburbs and the collieries around the city. The city once had five other railway stations:
* [[Nottingham Carrington Street railway station|Nottingham Carrington Street]] was the first station opened in Nottingham on the former [[Midland Counties Railway]]. It was opened in 1839, before closing in 1848 to passengers after the opening of Nottingham Midland station. The site is now under [[Nottingham Magistrates' Court]]. 
* [[Nottingham Victoria railway station|Nottingham Victoria]] which was the second largest station in the city. Owned jointly by the [[Great Central Railway]] and [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]]. It closed in 1967, after declining usage and the station buildings were demolished. The site is now the [[Victoria Centre]] shopping centre. The clock tower is still in situ and the cutting is under the shopping centre at the lower level including the old Mansfield Road Railway Tunnel.
* [[Nottingham Arkwright Street railway station|Nottingham Arkwright Street]] was originally the second station in Nottingham, near to Nottingham Midland. It was originally only to be opened temporarily but was kept open until 1963, when it was closed. It reopened briefly in 1967 as the terminus of a skeleton service from Nottingham to [[Leicester Central railway station|Leicester]] and [[Rugby Central railway station|Rugby]], only to be closed in 1969. The site is now buried under a road alignment, tram tracks and industrial buildings.
* [[Nottingham London Road railway station|Nottingham London Road Low and High Level]] was located directly north-east of Nottingham Midland and the low-level platforms were closed to passengers in 1944. The high-level platforms were closed in 1967. Goods services continued to serve the station until 1972 when the rails were removed. The station is still in situ and is now used as a leisure centre.
* [[Nottingham Racecourse railway station|Nottingham Racecourse]] was located near [[Nottingham Racecourse]] and was a minor station on the line between Nottingham and Grantham. The station closed in 1959 and the line is still in use. Nothing remains of the station.

==Public services==
===Emergency===
{{see also|Healthcare in Nottinghamshire}}
Fire and rescue services are provided by [[Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service]], and emergency medical care by [[East Midlands Ambulance Service]], both of which have their headquarters in Nottingham. There are two major [[National Health Service]] hospitals in Nottingham, the [[Queen's Medical Centre]] (QMC) and [[Nottingham City Hospital]], both managed by the [[Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust]]. The QMC is a [[teaching hospital]] with close connections to the [[University of Nottingham Medical School|Medical School at Nottingham University]]; until 2012, it was the largest hospital in the UK. Nottingham City Hospital includes maternity and neonatal facilities but has no [[Emergency department|A&E department]]. Students from the Medical School are attached to most of the departments at City Hospital as part of their clinical training.

Law enforcement is carried out by [[Nottinghamshire Police]], whose headquarters are at Sherwood Lodge in [[Arnold, Nottinghamshire|Arnold]]. The city has a [[Nottingham Crown Court|Crown Court]] and a [[Nottingham Magistrates' Court|Magistrates' Court]]. Laurie Macdonald of ''Inside One'' magazine observes that Nottingham's former high crime rate earned it the nickname "Shottingham", but that by 2013 this image was outdated. The article was written in response to a [[uSwitch]] survey that had found south Nottinghamshire to be the fourth-best place to live in the UK in terms of living standards. Crime in the city of Nottingham had also fallen by three-quarters since 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://insideonemagazine.com/shottingham-notts/|title=Shottingham?

===Utilities===
[[Severn Trent|Severn Trent Water]] is the company responsible for supplying fresh water to households and businesses in Nottingham, as well as the treatment of sewage. Severn Trent took over these services from the [[City of Nottingham Water Department]] in 1974.

Nottingham was host to the UK's first and only local authority–owned and not-for-profit energy company, [[Robin Hood Energy]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Nottingham City Council energy company claims UK first |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-34171736 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=1 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909173822/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-34171736 |archive-date=9 September 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Robin Hood Energy: Nottingham launches not-for-profit power firm |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/07/robin-hood-energy-nottingham-council-launches-not-for-profit-energy-company |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=7 September 2015 |access-date=1 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002112005/http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/07/robin-hood-energy-nottingham-council-launches-not-for-profit-energy-company |archive-date=2 October 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> [[Veolia]] operates a [[cogeneration]] (CHP) plant in Nottingham for generating energy from [[biomass]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.veolia.co.uk/press-releases/veolia-appointed-operator-new-biomass-chp-nottingham|title=Veolia appointed operator of new Biomass CHP in Nottingham|date=2 December 2015|publisher=[[Veolia]]|access-date=4 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207015431/https://www.veolia.co.uk/press-releases/veolia-appointed-operator-new-biomass-chp-nottingham|archive-date=7 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

The plant in the city centre supplies heat to 4,600 homes and a wide variety of business premises, including the Concert Hall, the Nottingham Arena, the Victoria Baths, the Broadmarsh Shopping Centre, the Victoria Centre, and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://enviroenergy.co.uk/about-us/|title=About EnviroEnergy|website=enviroenergy.co.uk|access-date=4 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207015208/https://enviroenergy.co.uk/about-us/|archive-date=7 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Religion==
[[File:Nottingham Roman Catholic Cathedral.jpg|thumb|[[Nottingham Cathedral]]]]

[[File:Nottingham Cathedral, Nottinghamshire, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|[[Nottingham Cathedral]]]]

Historically, the requirement for city status was the presence of an Anglican (Church of England) cathedral; however, Nottingham does not have one of these, having only been designated a city in 1897 in celebration of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. From around AD 1100, Nottingham was part of the [[Diocese of Lichfield]], controlled as an [[Archdeacon of Nottingham|archdeaconry]] from [[Lichfield Cathedral]] in Staffordshire. In 1837, Nottingham's archdeaconry was placed under the control of the [[Diocese of Lincoln]] and, in 1884, it was incorporated into the newly created [[Diocese of Southwell and Nottingham|Diocese of Southwell]] which it is still part of today. The bishop is based at [[Southwell Minster]], {{convert|14|mi|0}} northeast of the city.

[[File:St Mary Nottingham.jpg|thumb|[[St Mary's Church, Nottingham]]]]

Although lacking an Anglican cathedral, Nottingham has three notable historic [[Church of England parish church|Anglican parish churches]], all of which date back to the [[Middle Ages]]. The oldest and largest of these is [[St Mary's Church, Nottingham|St. Mary the Virgin]], situated in the Lace Market. The church dates from the eighth or ninth centuries, but the present structure is at least the third building on the site, dating primarily from 1377 to 1485. A member of the [[Major Churches Network]], St. Mary's is considered the [[mother church]] of the city and is used for holding civic services, including the annual welcome to the new Lord Mayor. In the heart of the city is [[St Peter's Church, Nottingham|St. Peter's]], the oldest building in continuous use in Nottingham, with traces of building dating back to 1180. The third notable Anglican parish church is [[St Nicholas Church, Nottingham|St. Nicholas']], known locally as "St. Nic's", situated on the edge of the city centre in the direction of the castle.

There are various chapels and meeting rooms in Nottingham. Many of the grand buildings have been demolished, including [[Halifax Place Wesleyan Chapel]], but some have been re-used, notably [[High Pavement Chapel]] which is now a public house. The city has three [[Christadelphian]] meeting halls and is home to the national headquarters of the [[Congregational Federation]].

Nottingham is one of 18 British cities that do not have an Anglican cathedral.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lovemytown.co.uk/citystatus/index.htm |title=City Status |publisher=Lovemytown.co.uk |access-date=22 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620043638/http://lovemytown.co.uk/CityStatus/index.htm |archive-date=20 June 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://lovemytown.co.uk/Cathedrals/CathedralsTable3.asp |title=Cathedrals |publisher=Lovemytown.co.uk |access-date=22 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116110835/http://www.lovemytown.co.uk/Cathedrals/CathedralsTable3.asp |archive-date=16 January 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> It is, however, home to the [[Nottingham Cathedral|Roman Catholic Cathedral of St. Barnabas]], which was designed by [[Augustus Pugin]] and [[consecration|consecrated]] in 1844. It is the cathedral church for the Roman Catholic [[Diocese of Nottingham]].

Today, there are places of worship for all major religions, including Christianity and [[Islam]] (with 32 mosques in Nottingham).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.islamicguide.co.uk |title=UK Mosque Masjid Directory, Muslim directory |publisher=Islamic directory |website=Islamicguide.co.uk |access-date=23 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221080225/http://islamicguide.co.uk/ |archive-date=21 December 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
