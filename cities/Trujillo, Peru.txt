It is the third most populous city<ref>{{cite book|title=Perú: Estimaciones y Proyecciones de Población Total por Sexo de las Principales Ciudades, 2000-2015|publisher=INEI|year=2012|pages=50|url=http://proyectos.inei.gob.pe/web/biblioineipub/bancopub/Est/Lib1020/Libro.pdf}}</ref> and center of the [[List of metropolitan areas of Peru|third most populous metropolitan area of Peru]]. It is located on the banks of the [[Moche River]], near its mouth at the Pacific Ocean, in the [[Moche Valley]].

The [[Independence of Trujillo]] from Spain was proclaimed in the [[Historic Centre of Trujillo]] on December 29, 1820, and the city was honored in 1822 by the [[Congress of the Republic of Peru]] with the title "Meritorious City and Faithful to the Fatherland",<ref name=RPP>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpp.com.pe/detalle_112694.html |title=Sucesos, información histórica |website=RPP Noticias |access-date=July 29, 2008}}</ref> for its role in the fight for Peruvian independence. Trujillo is the birthplace of Peru's [[judiciary]], and it was twice designated as the capital of the country. It was the scene of the [[Trujillo Revolution, 1932|Revolution of Trujillo in 1932]]. Trujillo is considered the "cradle of liberty and cradle of the judiciary in Peru".<ref name="PJ"/>

Trujillo is also known as the "City of Everlasting Spring",<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.larepublica.pe/05-03-2012/trujillo-celebra-477-aniversario-de-fundacion |newspaper=La República-Perú|language=es |date=19 April 2012 |title=Trujillo, la ciudad de la eterna primavera(Trujillo, City of the everlasting Spring)&nbsp;– La Republica}}</ref> is considered the "Capital of the [[Marinera]]", a traditional dance in Peru, "Cradle of the [[Peruvian paso|Peruvian Paso]] horse",<ref name="senamhi.gob.pe">{{cite web|title=Tourist Climate Guide&nbsp;– Peru |page=115 |url=http://www.senamhi.gob.pe/?p=0702}}</ref> as well as the "Capital of Culture of Peru".<ref name="Ministerio Público" /> It has sponsored numerous national and international cultural events, and has a lively arts community.

Trujillo is close to two major [[archeological]] sites of pre-Columbian monuments: [[Chan Chan]], the largest adobe city in the ancient world, designated a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1986; and the [[Huaca del Sol|temples of the Sun and Moon]] (the largest [[adobe]] pyramid in Peru).<ref name=destinos>{{cite web|url=http://media.peru.info/catalogo/Attach/destinosp_esp_10228.pdf |title=DESCUBRE PERU Un país...muchos destinos -Información turística de Trujillo |access-date=2012-07-29}}</ref>

The city center contains many examples of colonial and religious architecture, often incorporating distinctive [[wrought iron]]work. It includes residential areas, a central business district, and industrial supply distribution to the various districts. The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Trujillo]] has its seat here. [[Roman Catholicism]] is the predominant religion and 10 colonial churches are located within the old city wall, now encircled by [[España Avenue (Trujillo)|Avenida España]]; additional churches in the towns of [[Santiago de Huamán|Huamán]], [[Huanchaco]] and [[Moche, Trujillo|Moche]] are located within {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=off}} of Trujillo's centre.

Since 2011, the city has been developing the pilot project ''Trujillo: Sustainable City'', as part of the platform "Emerging and Sustainable Cities of the [[Inter-American Development Bank]]", in cooperation with the IDB.<ref name="Trujillo: Sustainable city-BID">{{cite web|url=http://www.rpp.com.pe/2011-06-28-bid-presentara-proyecto-piloto-trujillo-ciudad-sostenible-noticia_379609.html|title=Trujillo: Sustainable city-BID|date=June 28, 2011 }}</ref> In 2012 Trujillo was selected by [[IBM]] to participate in a "Smarter Cities Challenge" project intended to improve public safety and transportation through technology.<ref name="rpp.com.pe">{{cite web|url=http://www.rpp.com.pe/2012-11-15-trujillo-elegida-ciudad-inteligente-por-ibm-noticia_540493.html|title=(spanish)Trujillo elegida 'ciudad inteligente' por IBM|date=November 15, 2012 |access-date=November 15, 2012}}</ref><ref name="larepublica.pe">{{cite web|url=http://www.larepublica.pe/19-11-2012/trujillo-sera-beneficiada-por-el-programa-smarter-cities-challenge-de-ibm|title=(spanish)Trujillo será beneficiada por el programa "Smarter Cities Challenge" de IBM|access-date=November 19, 2012}}</ref>

==Identity==

===Capital of culture===
Trujillo is considered the "Capital of Culture of Peru"<ref name="Ministerio Público" /> for the prominent writers associated with the city<ref name=citymark>{{cite web |url = http://www.esan.edu.pe/publicaciones/2011/02/25/city-marketing-trujillo.pdf|title= Programa de city marketing y creación de marca para Trujillo|access-date=July 5, 2012}}</ref> such as [[Cesar Vallejo]] and [[Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre]], and because the city is a center for important cultural expressions as the [[marinera]] dance, [[peruvian paso|Peruvian paso horses]], [[caballitos de totora]], Trujillo's gastronomy, etc. The [[North Group]] was formed here, with [[Eduardo González Viaña]] and [[Gerardo Chávez]] as successors. The city presents important national festivals, such as [[Trujillo Marinera Festival|Marinera Festival]], [[Trujillo Spring Festival|Spring Festival]], and competitions for the paso horse and [[caballito de totora]].

===Symbols===

====Coat of arms====
The [[Coat of arms of Trujillo, Peru|coat of arms]] of the city was awarded on December 7, 1537, by Royal Decree issued by the King of Spain, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The shield consists of two columns rising from water, a king's crown on top surrounded by pearls and precious stones and two staffs that surround the letter K (for ''Karolus'', [[royal cypher]] of the King); and on the back is a black [[griffin]] facing right and supporting the shield.

====Flag====
The flag is the coat of arms on a white background; it is carried during the official ceremonies of the [[Municipality of Trujillo]] in the main square of the city. Also it is flown every December 29 to commemorate the proclamation of independence of Trujillo in 1820.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

====Anthem====
The anthem was written by [[Ramiro Mendoza Sánchez]] with music composed by [[Ramiro Herrera Orbegoso]]. It is performed mainly for official civic ceremonies, by bands of musicians.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==History==
The history of Trujillo has its beginning in ancient times, as the area at the mouth of the Moche River was long a center of successive pre-European cultures. They extended their domains along the northern coast of Peru.<ref>{{cite web  |url = http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/incas/materialism.pdf |title = Expansion of Ancient Peruvian Empires|access-date =March 29, 2012}}</ref>

===Pre-Columbian era===

[[File:Mochica Headress Condor.jpg|thumb|left|[[Moche (culture)|Moche]] headdress, {{circa}} AD 400]]

[[File:Mapa cultura chimu.jpg|thumb|upright|Map of [[Chimu]] empire expansion]]

The archaeological history of this region goes back to the early pre-[[ceramic]] period. For example, [[Huaca Prieta]] was occupied as early as 4700&nbsp;BC.

Several ancient cultures developed in this area: the [[Cupisnique]], the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] and [[Chimú culture|Chimu]]. Numerous [[archaeological site]]s and monumental remains attest to the high degree of complexity of these civilizations.

Among the Cupisnique culture sites are [[Caballo Muerto]] and Huaca Prieta.

The Moche culture sites include [[huaca]]s: the [[Huaca del Sol|Temples of the Sun and Moon]]<ref name="isbn0-8160-2581-9">{{cite book |last=Cameron |first=Ian |title=Kingdom of the Sun God: a history of the Andes and their people |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York |year=1990 |page=[https://archive.org/details/kingdomofsungodh00came/page/43 43] |isbn=0-8160-2581-9 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/kingdomofsungodh00came/page/43 }}</ref> south of the city, the Huaca del Dragón (or Rainbow Huaca) and the Huaca Esmeralda to the north, and others.

The Chimu culture built its primary settlement at what is known as [[Chan Chan]], which was the capital, having an estimated 100,000 people at its peak. It is the largest pre-Columbian city built of [[adobe]] and has been designated a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Its remains are {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=in}} northwest of the current city center. The present Spanish–Peruvian city of Trujillo was founded in an ancestral territory populated by ancient indigenous civilizations. The Spanish founded new cities expressing their culture in what they called the "[[Viceroyalty of Peru]]".

====Southern Moche civilization====
{{Main|Moche (culture)}}
[[file:Mochica del norte y mochica del sur.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Map of the region of the Bishopric of Trujillo shows the ''city of Trujillo'' within the culture that is currently called "Southern Moche" (in orange)]]
The Southern Moche civilization flourished in northern Peru with its Huacas del Sol y de la Luna from about AD&nbsp;100 to 800, during the Regional Development Epoch. The people likely had formed into a group of autonomous polities that shared a common elite culture, as seen in the rich iconography and monumental architecture that survive today. They are particularly noted for their elaborately-painted [[ceramic]]s, [[gold]] work, monumental constructions (huacas) and [[irrigation]] systems.<ref name="Bawden"/>

Moche history is broadly divided into three periods&nbsp;– the emergence of the Moche culture in the Early Moche (AD&nbsp;100–300), its expansion and florescence during the Middle Moche (300–600), and the urban nucleation and subsequent collapse in the Late Moche (500–750).<ref name="Bawden">{{cite book|last=Bawden|first= G.|date= 2004 |contribution=The Art of Moche Politics|title=Andean Archaeology|editor-first= H.|editor-last= Silverman |location=Oxford|publisher= Blackwell Publishers}}{{ISBN missing}}{{page needed|date=November 2019}}</ref> Moche society was agriculture-based, and the cultural leaders invested in the construction of a network of [[irrigation canal]]s for the diversion of river water to supply the crops. Their culture was sophisticated; and their artifacts fully express their lives, including scenes of hunting, fishing, fighting, sacrifice, elaborate ceremonies, and sexual acts.

====Chimu Empire====
{{Main|Chimu culture}}
[[file:Lenguas del obispado de Trujillo.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Quingnam language]] area in the Bishopric of Trujillo, the ''city of Trujillo'' is shown as the main representative place of this language]]

The Chimu built and occupied a territory known as [[Chimor]], with its capital at the city of [[Chan Chan]], a large adobe city in the [[Valley of Moche]] (around which present-day Trujillo city developed). The culture arose about 900 and flourished into the 14th century. 

The Chimos were characterized by speaking the [[Quingnam language]], one of the languages that is certain to have existed in the ancient province of Trujillo:

{{blockquote|[A] cacique of what is today called '''Trujillo''', called the Chimo [...] was conquering the Yunga indians, and making the provinces of these plains from Paramonga to Paita and Tumbes tributaries [...] and with his power he was introducing his native language, which is the one spoken today in the valleys of Trujillo. It was '''[[Quingnam language|Quingnam]]''', the language of this lord  [...] |[[Antonio de la Calancha]] (1584-1654)<ref>{{cite book | vauthors=((Urban, M.)) | date= 2019 | title=Lost languages of the Peruvian north coast | publisher=Gebr. Mann Verlag | series=Estudios Indiana | pages=225| url=https://www.iai.spk-berlin.de/fileadmin/dokumentenbibliothek/Estudios_Indiana/Estudios-Indiana-12.pdf | isbn=978-3-7861-2826-7}}</ref>}}

The [[Inca]] ruler [[Tupac Inca Yupanqui]] led a campaign which conquered the Chimu in around 1470.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kubler |first=George |date=1962 |title=The Art and Architecture of Ancient America |location=Ringwood, Victoria |publisher=Penguin Books Australia |pages=247–274}}</ref>

This was just 50 years before the arrival of the Spanish in the region. Consequently, Spanish chroniclers recorded accounts of Chimu culture from persons who had lived before the Inca conquest. Similarly, archaeological evidence suggest Chimor emerged from the remnants of Moche culture; early Chimu pottery had some resemblance to that of the Moche. Their ceramics are all-black, and their work in precious metals is very detailed and intricate. In the Late Chimu period, about 12,000 artisans lived and worked in Chan Chan alone.<ref name="Moseley, M. E. 1990">{{cite book|editor1-last=Moseley |editor1-first=M.&nbsp;E. |editor2-last=Cordy-Collins |editor2-first=A. |date=1990 |title=The Northern Dynasties: Kingships and Statecraft in Chimor|location= Washington, DC |publisher=Dumbarton Oaks}}{{ISBN missing}}</ref> They engaged in fishing, agriculture, craft work, and trade. Artisans were forbidden to change their profession, and were grouped together in the citadel according to their area of specialization. Archeologists have noted a dramatic rise in the volume of Chimu craft production, which they attribute to artisans having been brought to [[Chan Chan]] from another area taken in conquest.<ref name="Moseley, M.

E. 1990"/> The men engaged in fishing, heavy agriculture (aided by irrigation and earthworks), and metallurgy. The women made ceramics and textiles (from spun and dyed [[cotton]], [[llama]], [[alpaca]], and [[vicuña wool]]). People used [[reed (plant)|reed]] fishing [[canoe]]s, hunted, and traded using [[bronze]] coins.

In 2018 archaeologists uncovered the world’s largest child-sacrifice site at Trujillo. ''[[National Geographic]]'' discovered the remains of over 140 children and the skeletons of llamas, apparently the result of ritual sacrifice.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thevintagenews.com/2018/05/02/worlds-largest-child-sacrifice/|title=Archaeologists uncover world's largest child-sacrifice site in coastal Peru|date=May 2, 2018|website=thevintagenews.com}}</ref>

===Colonial era===

====Spanish foundation====
[[File:CédularealTrujillo1 lou.jpg|thumb|upright|Royal decree granting the coat of arms.]]
{{main|Foundation of Trujillo, Peru}}
Trujillo was one of the first cities in the Americas founded by the [[Spanish conquistadors]].<ref name=Prescott>{{cite book|last=Prescott |first=W.&nbsp;H. |date=2011 |title=The History of the Conquest of Peru |publisher=Digireads.com |isbn=978-1-420-94114-2}}</ref>{{rp|125}} They arrived in an area that had been inhabited and developed for thousands of years by the [[indigenous peoples]]. According to historian [[Napoleón Cieza Burga]], the [[conquistador]] [[Diego de Almagro]] founded the first settlement in November 1534,<ref name="laindustria.pe"/> calling it ''Trujillo of New Castile'' after [[Trujillo, Cáceres|Trujillo]], the home city of [[Francisco Pizarro]]. It was founded among four Chimu settlements: Huanchaco, Huamán, Moche and Mampuesto, to create an alliance against the [[Incas]]. On November 23, 1537, King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]] of Spain gave the town the rank of 'city' and the [[coat of arms]] that remains a symbol for the city; it was the first city in Peru to receive a coat of arms from the king.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.mpfn.gob.pe/distrito_judicial/infoturistica_detalle.php?dj=lalibertad&id=302|title =Ministerio Público&nbsp;– Fiscalía de la Nación: Información del distrito judicial La Libertad|date =April 15, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20120514221721/http://www.mpfn.gob.pe/distrito_judicial/infoturistica_detalle.php?dj=lalibertad&id=302|archive-date =May 14, 2012|df =mdy-all}}</ref> By 1544 Trujillo had around 300 homes and 1,000 inhabitants, and an economy booming from the cultivation of [[sugar cane]], [[wheat]], and other food crops and the raising of livestock.

The Spanish colonists welcomed a diverse array of religious orders from the time of its founding, and there was a boom in church construction in the city during the 16th and 17th centuries. In 1577 [[Pope Gregory XIII]] created the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Trujillo|Diocese of Trujillo]], and in 1616 construction work commenced on the [[Trujillo Cathedral|cathedral]].

On February 14, 1619, Trujillo was struck by an [[earthquake]], resulting in the near-total destruction of the city and the deaths of around 400 of its inhabitants. Rebuilding was slow. The people developed a devotion to [[Saint Valentine]], on whose day the earthquake hit. The [[Jesuits]] opened a [[seminary]] and school for the education and training of priests; they also served as [[missionaries]] to the indigenous peoples, as they introduced Christianity.

====17th century====

=====The Wall of Trujillo=====
{{Main|Wall of Trujillo}}
[[File:Plano Trujillo 1786.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Trujillo in 1786, by [[Baltasar Jaime Martínez Compañón]], showing the [[Wall of Trujillo|City Walls of Trujillo]]]]
Due to the proximity of the city to the sea (about {{convert|4|km|mi|disp=sqbr|abbr=in}} away) and the danger of attack by [[pirate]]s and privateers, the [[Wall of Trujillo]] was built for defense during the reign of Viceroy Melchor de Navarra and Rocafull<ref name=walloftrujillo>{{cite web |url = http://www.mincetur.gob.pe/TURISMO/OTROS/inventario%20turistico/Ficha.asp?cod_Ficha=117|title= (spanish)Muralla Militar De Trujillo Colonial - Ministerio de Turismo del Gobierno Peruano|editor = MINCETUR  |access-date=October 9, 2012}}</ref> and the city mayors [[Bartolome Martinez]] and [[Fernando Ramirez Jarabeitia Orellana]]. This wall was built by an Italian architect, Giuseppe Formento, who began construction on February 19, 1687. Formento based his design on that by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] for the Italian city of [[Florence]]. The wall was designed in an elliptical shape to save costs in its construction, and was completed in 1689. The wall reached a perimeter of {{convert|5.5|km|abbr=in}} and used more than 100,000 bricks. The defensive structure was composed of 15 bastions, 15 shades and 5 covered gates.

The [[Huamán]] Gate was oriented westward to the road to the village of the same name. The [[Mansiche, La Libertad, Peru|Mansiche]] Gate was located to the north, giving way to the highway. The Miraflores Gate opened to the east. The Sierra Gate was named after the road leading to this region. Lastly, the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] Gate gave access to people coming from the south. In 1942 the city developed a master plan; following the path of the ancient wall, it built [[España Avenue (Trujillo)|Avenida España]] to encircle the area now called the Historical Center of Trujillo.

In the latter half of the 17th century, severe [[drought]]s and [[Infectious disease|pestilence]] caused a major economic crisis for the city, which depended on agriculture. Trujillo regained prominence in the 18th century, in part due to the destruction of the city of [[Saña, Peru|Saña]] by flooding in 1720. Trujillo also suffered from flooding in 1701, 1720, 1728 and 1814; and [[earthquake]]s in 1725 and 1759.

By 1760 an estimated 9,200 people were living in the vicinity of the city. The foundation of the Municipality of Trujillo in 1779 coincided with a peak of prosperity for the city. Numerous undeveloped lots remained within the city walls but Trujillo was regarded as one of the most important cities in Northern Peru during the colonial era.

===Independence===
[[File:Edifici del jirón Independencia a la Plaza de Armas de Trujillo.jpg|thumb|Independence Street in front of Main Square, at right ''El Libertador Hotel'']]
[[File:Jirón Francisco Pizarro de Trujillo05.jpg|thumb|Architecture of [[Paseo Pizarro]], one of the busiest streets in the historic center of Trujillo. In the background is the historic [[Plazuela El Recreo]], with tall trees forming the skyline in that part of the city.]]
Inspired by liberal ideas from members of its educational institutions, Trujillo became a principal centre of Peruvian republican sentiments. Led by the city mayor and [[intendant]] [[José Bernardo de Tagle]], the [[Intendancy of Trujillo]] declared its independence from Spain on December 29, 1820.

Between 1821 and 1825 the Trujillo region was the only stable and productive land within the nascent republic. In 1823 Trujillo took on the role of the first capital city of the Republic of Peru. On July 19, 1823, the Peruvian Congress located here repeated its invitation to [[Simón Bolívar]], a leader in Bolivia, to join the war of independence. In 1824 the city received the liberation army of Bolívar, and was again designated as the seat of government. It is the only city to have twice been designated as the capital.

The years following the revolution saw the growth in the economic influence of the city, compensating for a loss of political power to [[Lima]] when it was designated as the capital, which instead suffered from the resulting political turmoil. The [[Valley of Moche|Moche]] and [[Chicama Valley|Chicama]] valleys emerged as new economic enclaves for the [[sugar cane]] industry. Land was increasingly concentrated in large estates and a new "agricultural aristocracy" developed that was linked to and influenced national political power. The policy of free trade and openness to foreign investment attracted an influx of Europeans, principally from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Germany]]. By then, Trujillo had a population of 15,000 and began to grow beyond the city walls. New architectural styles were adopted, influenced by [[French Romanticism|French]] and [[English Romanticism]].

During the [[War of the Pacific]] against [[Chile]] between 1879 and 1883, Trujillo contributed troops towards national defence. Although never a site of battle, Trujillo suffered from occupation by Chilean troops and their plundering of the surrounding countryside.

====First Independent City of Peru====

It is considered the "First Independent City of Peru" for three reasons: it proclaimed independence from Spain on December 24, 1820<ref name=RB>Peru Bicentenario: {{cite web |url = http://www.perubicentenario.pe/noticias/diciembre2011/29dic_Trujillo_celebra_191_Aniversario_del_primer_grito_de_libertad.html |archive-url = https://archive.today/20130113154711/http://www.perubicentenario.pe/noticias/diciembre2011/29dic_Trujillo_celebra_191_Aniversario_del_primer_grito_de_libertad.html |url-status=dead|archive-date = 2013-01-13 |title = Trujillo: First Independent City of Peru<!-- Please check the title, I get no access to the external link.

And the link text says: "Trujillo celebra 191 Aniversario del primer grito de libertad". Which one is right? --> }}{{clarify|date=November 2016|reason=Please clarify the correct title.}}</ref> at the historical "Casa de la Emancipación" (House of Emancipation). Its leaders signed the declaration of independence at the Seminario de San Carlos y San Marcelo and proclaimed independence to an open council meeting in the Plaza de Armas, on December 29, 1820. Finally, on January 6, 1821, its leaders ratified the agreement and the proclamation of the independence of this city, as stated in the document called ''Libro rojo'' (the Red Book) of the Trujillo council.

Their actions gained independence for almost all of northern Peru, because the government of Trujillo city ruled what is now the regions of Tumbes, Piura, Lambayeque, La Libertad, Cajamarca, San Martín and Amazonas. Marquis of Torre Tagle said, "My people. From this time for the unanimous will of the people, Trujillo is free. I put our fate and that of people under the protection of Heaven! Long live the homeland! Long live independence!"<ref name=RB/><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.elcorreodesalem.com/?s=el+bicentenario+debe+celebrarse+en+trujillo |title = El Bicentenario debe celebrarse en Trujillo

===Republican era===
[[File:Trujillo (2).JPG|thumb|Architecture of the 18th and 19th centuries, Plaza de Armas]]
[[File:Universidad Nacional de Trujillo.JPG|thumb|left|The [[National University of Trujillo]] was the first republican university founded in Peru<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.peru.gob.pe/docs/PLANES/10402/PLAN_10402_Estatuto_de_la_UNT_2011.pdf|title = National University of Trujillo|access-date =May 25, 2012}}</ref>]]

The Provisional Regulations given by General San Martín in 1821 created the Department of Trujillo, based on colonial administration. This status was acknowledged in the first [[Constitution of Peru]] in 1823. Because of its size and economic wealth, the Department of Trujillo between 1821 and 1825 was the only stable and productive area that could organize and lead the nascent republic. The department encompassed nearly half the country. For the efforts of its people in the war of emancipation, San Martín gave it the title of "Meritorious City Loyal to the Homeland". The municipality of the city, then called a ''[[cabildo (council)|cabildo]]'', was given the rank of "honorable".

In 1823, after the creation of the Republic of Peru, the protectorate of José de San Martín was developed. Before royal troops took the city of Lima, the first President of Peru, Don [[José de la Riva Agüero]], together with Sánchez Carrión, named Trujillo as provisional capital of the country, which survived for a short period.

In 1824 the city received the liberation army of [[Simón Bolívar]]. Taking over the government of the country, he established a temporary government of the country in Trujillo, on March 8, 1824.

In 1821 the Court of Appeals was created to replace the Royal Court. Its jurisdiction extended over the present departments of Cajamarca, Piura, Lambayeque, Amazonas (then known as the Chachapoyas), and Huamachuco (then known as Sánchez Carrión). On March 26, 1824 [[Simón Bolívar]] established Trujillo's first Superior Court of Justice as the Northern Superior Court. It had been the first high court established in the Republic of Peru with the powers of the Supreme Court.

====19th century====
By the end of the 19th century the five entrances had disappeared from the city, so it was that during this time the [[Wall of Trujillo]] was torn down and allowed the growth of the city. This urban expansion allowed the establishment of the neighborhoods of Chicago, La Unión and Pedro Muñiz. During the administration of Don Víctor Larco Herrera as mayor, the city began upgrading works such as the construction of City Hall, the arrangement and embellishment of the Plaza de Armas and the atrium of the cathedral. It also built the road to the resort of [[Buenos Aires, Trujillo|Buenos Aires]], which expanded the city urban planning perspective. Another project was the renovation of the Municipal Theater.

====20th century====
[[File:Jirón Gamarra.jpg|thumb|Gamarra Street, in the city center]]
In July 1932, Trujillo was once again at the centre of one of the most important episodes in the history of the Republic of Peru, the [[Trujillo Revolution, 1932|Trujillo Revolution of 1932]], which cost the lives of many citizens. Although this year came to be known as the "year of barbarism", it would also mark the political identity of the city during the second half of the 20th century.

The latter half of the 20th century saw the expansion of the city due to a combination of rural-to-urban migration and the consolidation of surrounding districts into the [[Trujillo metropolitan area (Peru)|Trujillo metropolitan area]].

From 1980 Trujillo took on the aspect and behavior of a particularly dynamic [[metropolitan area]], by which time the growth of the city and adjoining districts had produced a single metropolitan area, so in the 1980s the nascent Trujillo metropolitan area consisted of the integrated urban districts of [[Trujillo District|Trujillo]], [[El Porvenir District, Trujillo|El Porvenir]] and [[Florencia de Mora District|Florencia de Mora]], with Víctor Larco Herrera and La Esperanza remaining discontinuous districts. In 1981 the city had 403,337 inhabitants. Also in the 1980s the Trujillo Industrial Park project was begun, located on the north side of the city, in the present La Esperanza district.

With the advent of the 1990s, the city of Trujillo was unified with the districts of [[La Esperanza District, Trujillo|La Esperanza]] and [[Víctor Larco Herrera, Peru|Victor Larco Herrera]] and the spread of the city resulted in the districts of [[Moche District|Moche]], [[Trujillo District|Trujillo]], [[Salaverry District|Salaverry]], and [[Laredo District|Laredo]] becoming part of the metropolitan area. In the first half of the 1990s, after the emergence of the El Milagro area in [[Huanchaco District|Huanchaco]], it was joined to La Esperanza district, and increasing interdependence with the districts of Moche and Laredo, which was cemented Trujillo as a new [[metropolis]] of Peru, then with a population of 589,314 inhabitants.

====21st century====

=====Modernization of the city=====
With the experience of the last two decades of the 20th century, when the city experienced an excessive disordered growth while increasing the costs for providing basic services to the population, the Provincial Municipality of Trujillo created the Trujillo Metropolitan Development Plan 2010, known as "Plandemetru", which was approved by city ordinance on November 30, 1995. Through this was planned the growth and development of the city up to 2010; later the lines of development of the metropolis were governed by the "Strategic Plan for Integral Development and Sustainable Trujillo till 2015" containing general guidelines for the development of the city by 2015.

=====Sustainable and smart city=====

In November 2010, Trujillo was the first city in Latin America and the [[Caribbean]] to be chosen by the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB) to develop the pilot "Sustainable City" project as part of the platform "Emerging and Sustainable Cities of the Inter-American Development Bank".<ref name="Trujillo: Sustainable city-BID"/> This project includes a plan of action on [[climate change]], which will be held on emissions limits in Trujillo, and will review the list of investment projects with respect to climate sustainability. According to IDB representative Fidel Jaramillo, Trujillo was chosen as the first driver of progress in Latin America to develop a new initiative. Trujillo's plan is to conceive from other perspectives such as fiscal and financial sustainability, which is basic, but also from environmental sustainability and quality of life. The IDB is developing relevant projects in coordination with the Provincial Municipality of Trujillo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://laindustria.pe/actualidad/economia/bid-trujillo-ciudad-sostenible-es-nuestro-proyecto-estrella|title=Trujillo: Sustainable city -BID|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095306/http://laindustria.pe/actualidad/economia/bid-trujillo-ciudad-sostenible-es-nuestro-proyecto-estrella|archive-date=March 10, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://laindustria.pe/incluidos/infografia/A4-14-12-12.pdf|title=Trujillo: Identifican zonas de vulnerabilidad|access-date=December 14, 2012}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In 2012 Trujillo began to develop, with the support of American technology corporation [[IBM]], the "Smart City" project, which will try to focus technologically on the two problems of public safety and transportation.<ref name="rpp.com.pe"/><ref name="larepublica.pe"/>[[File:Panorámica Trujillo Perú.jpg|thumb|center|880x880px|Panoramic view of Trujillo, at left the headquarters of the Public Ministry]]

==Geography==

===Location===
Trujillo is located at an altitude of {{convert|34|m|ft|abbr=off}} on a coastal strip in the west of the province of Trujillo, in the old valley of [[Chimor]] today known as the Moche or Santa Catalina Valley. Its main square is located at {{coord|8|6|3|S|79|1|34|W}} longitude at an altitude of {{convert|31.16|m|ft|2|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]] and lies {{convert|4.40|km|mi|2|abbr=off}} inland from the [[Pacific Ocean]], in a straight line along Avenido Larco.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.plandet.gob.pe/images/DESCARGAS/plan_estrategico_de_desarrollo_integral_y_sostenible_de_trujillo.pdf|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150924073901/http://www.plandet.gob.pe/images/DESCARGAS/plan_estrategico_de_desarrollo_integral_y_sostenible_de_trujillo.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date =2015-09-24|title =Plan Estratégico de Desarrollo integral y Sostenible de Trujillo}}</ref>

===Climate===
This city has a [[desert climate]] (''BWh'', according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]) and it is known as ''La Ciudad de la Eterna Primavera'' (city of everlasting spring) because of its sunny and pleasant weather year-round. The ''International Spring Festival'' in early October attracts visitors from all over Peru and the world. The city is in an area of mild climate and low rainfall, with moderate temperatures ranging between {{convert|14|and|30|°C|abbr=on}} due to the [[Humboldt Current]].<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.plandet.gob.pe/images/DESCARGAS/plan_estrategico_de_desarrollo_integral_y_sostenible_de_trujillo.pdf|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150924073901/http://www.plandet.gob.pe/images/DESCARGAS/plan_estrategico_de_desarrollo_integral_y_sostenible_de_trujillo.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date =2015-09-24|title =Plan Estratégico de Desarrollo integral y Sostenible de Trujillo al 2015}}</ref>
Trujillo has a warm climate during the day and mild during the night due to the [[sea breeze]]. It has an average temperature of {{convert|18|°C|abbr=on}}, and the extreme minimum and maximum temperatures fluctuate between {{convert|17|and|28|°C|abbr=on}} in winter and summer, respectively. Rains are light, sporadic and occur during the afternoon or evening. The [[Andes]] and their foothills are very close to the coast, and having a lower elevation relative to the mountains of central and southern Peru, the flow of moist air from the [[Amazon region]], which converges with the sea breezes from the west, favors during the summer a higher frequency of light showers. According to the climate classification of [[C. W. Thornthwaite|Thornthwaite]], city of Trujillo would correspond to an arid climate type with no rain during all seasons.<ref>{{cite web|website=Senamhi|title=Guía Climática Turística—Perú|url= http://www.senamhi.gob.pe/?p=0702}}</ref>

The parts of the city closest to the sea experience [[haze]] during the morning and usually the temperature is lower than in the central and upper parts of the city. However, during the phenomenon of [[El Niño]] the climate varies, mainly the rainfall, with less intensity than in regions located north of the city, and the temperature can also be lifted.

===Hydrography===

Tourism is a major industry in Trujillo due to the city's proximity to important sites where the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] and [[Chimu]] civilizations evolved. These civilizations had highly skilled artisans, and many of their artifacts having been found during [[archaeological]] digs in the city.
Nearby ruins include the Chimu adobe city of Chan Chan, the world's largest city built from that material. It is sometimes called ''Ciudad de la Luna'' (City of the Moon) because the people worshipped the moon; or ''de las Largas Murallas'' (of the Long Walls). In size and complexity, it has been compared with [[Teotihuacan]] in Mexico, and the ancient cities of [[Egypt]]. Other nearby ruins are the Moche ruins of ''[[Huaca del Sol]]'', ''[[Huaca de la Luna]]'', ''[[Huaca del Dragón|Huaca del Dragón o Arco Iris]]'', ''[[Huaca Esmeralda]]'' and ''[[El Brujo]]''.

Trujillo aspires to be designated a [[World Heritage Site]], because of the proximity of both cultures and its historical colonial city centre, whose historic ''casonas'' (mansions) attract many visitors. The mansions and manors of Trujillo are distinguished for their solemn and austere façades. Inside, their halls are overflowing with ornaments.

Trujillo's [[wrought-iron]] window railings are a unique feature of the mansions. The House of Ganoza-Chopitea (''casa Ganoza'') has a polychromatic front in the [[baroque style]], crowned by a [[rococo]] frontispiece and two lions. It is the city's most representative example of ''casonas'' architecture. Another is the House of Mayorazgo, which was built in the early years of the city and holds one of [[Peru]]'s greatest [[numismatic]] collections. The revolutionary leader [[Simón Bolívar]] lived in a house on the Plaza de Armas.
