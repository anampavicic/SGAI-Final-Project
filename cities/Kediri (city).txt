'''Kediri''' ({{Langx|jv|ꦏꦸꦛꦏꦝꦶꦫꦶ}}, ''Kutha Kadhiri'') is a city, located near the [[Brantas|Brantas River]] in the [[Provinces of Indonesia|province]] of [[East Java]] on the island of [[Java]] in [[Indonesia]]. It covers an area of 67.23&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and had a population of 268,950 at the 2010 Census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 286,796 at the 2020 Census;<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 298,830 (comprising 148,296 males and 150,524 females).<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Kediri Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.3571)</ref> It is one of two '[[Subdivisions of Indonesia#Regencies and Cities|Daerah Tingkat II]]' that have the name 'Kediri' (the other is [[Kediri Regency|the Regency of Kediri]], which surrounds the city). The city is administratively separated from the Regency, of which it was formerly the capital.

Archaeological artefacts discovered in 2007 appeared to indicate that the region around Kediri may have been the location of the [[Kediri Kingdom]], a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] kingdom in the 11th century.<ref>[http://www.tourismindonesia.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=524&Itemid=33 Kediri archeological discovery offers clues on ancient kingdom] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328004059/http://www.tourismindonesia.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=524&Itemid=33 |date=28 March 2007 }}, ''[[The Jakarta Post]]'', 24 March 2007.</ref>

==History==

Traditionally, the city of Kediri is said to have been founded on 27 July 879,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kedirikota.go.id/page/kota-kediri |title=Selayang Pandang Kota Kediri |publisher=Municipal Government of Kediri |access-date=25 May 2019 |archive-date=25 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190525204602/https://www.kedirikota.go.id/page/kota-kediri |url-status=live }}</ref> and today the city's anniversary is celebrated on that date.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rri.co.id/surabaya/post/berita/554078/seni_-_budaya/hari_jadi_ke1139_pemkot_kediri_gelar_upacara_manusuk_sima.html |title=Hari Jadi Ke-1.139, Pemkot Kediri Gelar Upacara Manusuk Sima |publisher=[[Radio Republik Indonesia]] |date=27 July 2018 |access-date=25 May 2019 |archive-date=25 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190525204613/http://rri.co.id/surabaya/post/berita/554078/seni_-_budaya/hari_jadi_ke1139_pemkot_kediri_gelar_upacara_manusuk_sima.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Brantas River]] valley was known as the site of classical Javanese culture, particularly between the 10th and 15th centuries. The town of Kediri was established by King [[Airlangga]] on the banks of the upper Brantas river in 1042. It was originally called '''Dahanapura''' or '''Daha'''. After the death of Airlangga his kingdom was divided into two parts: the kingdom of Panjalu in the west, and the kingdom of [[Janggala]] in the east. Daha became the capital of Panjalu, and later the capital of the [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri kingdom]].<ref name=indianized>{{Cite book |last=Cœdès |first=George |author-link=Georges Coedès |title=The Indianized states of Southeast Asia |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |year=1968 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iDyJBFTdiwoC |isbn=9780824803681 |access-date=22 September 2016 |archive-date=21 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221060339/https://books.google.com/books?id=iDyJBFTdiwoC |url-status=live }}</ref>{{rp|146–147,158}} Over the centuries, control of the city passed to the [[Singhasari]], [[Majapahit]], [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] and [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]] kingdoms.

The name "Kediri", or "Kadiri", is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''Khadri'', meaning [[Morinda citrifolia|Indian Mulberry]], indicative of the mulberry trees (locally known as ''pacé'' or ''mengkudu'') which grew in the area.
[[File:Storming of Kediri 1689 - The Crown of Mataram (1890).png|thumb|VOC troops [[Kediri campaign (1678)|storming Kediri]] – then the capital of Trunajaya – in 1678 during the [[Trunajaya War]]. Depicted in an 1890 Dutch children's novel.]]
After the era of the Javanese kingdoms, Kediri went into decline, becoming a small rural settlement, which was later annexed by the [[Dutch East India Company]] ([[Dutch East India Company|VOC]]) as part of the Dutch conquest of Java. East Java in the 1740s was controlled by [[Cakraningrat IV]], a Madurese regent who was favorably disposed toward the VOC, as he believed the Dutch would help him in securing the independence of [[Madura]] from the [[Mataram Sultanate|Kasunanan Kartasura kingdom]]. However, when his plans were rejected by the VOC, Cakraningrat rise against the Europeans. The rebellion was ultimately suppressed by the VOC, assisted by two generals sent by [[Pakubuwana II]], Sunan Kartasura. Kediri then became part of the VOC and remained under Dutch control until the independence of Indonesia in 1945.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kedirikota.go.id/read/Sejarah/93/1/41/Sejarah%20Kota.html |title=History of Kediri by City Council |access-date=20 October 2013 |archive-date=29 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929152024/http://www.kedirikota.go.id/read/Sejarah/93/1/41/Sejarah%20Kota.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Kediri began to flourish when the [[Dutch East Indies]] founded the autonomous ''Gemeente Kediri'' in 1906. ''Zelfstanding Gemeenteschap'' (self-government with full autonomy) was granted in 1928.

During the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] in 1945–1949, Kediri became a target of General [[Sudirman]]'s guerrilla campaign. Kediri suffered terrible bloodshed during the [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66]] after the failed [[30 September Movement]] coup. One estimate suggests that around 13% of Kediri's population or 22,000 people were killed during the Indonesian mass killings of 1965-66.<ref> Chandra, Siddharth "New Findings on the Indonesian Killings of 1965–66", Association for Asian Studies 76 no.4, (November 2017):1059-1086. </ref>

The [[Gudang Garam]] [[kretek]] [[tobacco]] industry was established in 1958 by [[Chinese Indonesian]] Tjoa Ing Hwie. He purchased vast lands in Kediri and established a kretek cigar factory. Today, Gudang Garam is the major employer of the city, with more than 40,000 workers.

== Administrative districts ==
