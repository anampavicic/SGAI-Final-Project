[[File:OldSemporna.jpg|thumb|left|Semporna town in 1910, during the British period.]]
Semporna was founded soon after the [[British North Borneo Company|British North Borneo Chartered Company]] established [[Sandakan]], and initially settled by [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] traders, most fleeing from Spanish attacks on the Sulu Sultanate. Before being named "Semporna", this area was known as "Tong Talun" in [[Bajaw language|Bajau language]] which means "Hujung Hutan" in [[Malay language|Malay]] or "at the end of the forest" in English.<ref name="Semporna">{{cite web|url=http://www.sabah.gov.my/pd.sprn/SejarahSemporna.html|title=Sejarah Semporna|language=ms, en|publisher=Semporna District Office|access-date=8 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108223552/http://www.sabah.gov.my/pd.sprn/SejarahSemporna.html|archive-date=8 November 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Panglima Uddang, Panglima Sallehangni and Panglima Sakti of ''Bajaus Kubang'' ancestry were responsible for this name.<ref name="Semporna"/> Governor Treacher renamed the place "Labuan Semporna" which is Malay for "perfect anchorage" but the word Labuan was subsequently dropped.<ref>British North Borneo Herald, 16 August 1918, p. 149.</ref> Other sources translate "Semporna" as "Peaceful Place".<ref name="Semporna"/>
