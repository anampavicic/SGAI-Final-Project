'''Cienfuegos''' ({{IPA|es-419|sjeɱˈfweɣos|lang}}), capital of [[Cienfuegos Province]], is a city on the southern coast of [[Cuba]].<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle= Cienfuegos|volume=6|page=364}}</ref> It is located about {{convert|250|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Havana]] and has a population of 178,368 in 2022.<ref name="citypopulation">{{Cite web |title=Cienfuegos (Municipality, Cuba) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map and Location |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/cuba/admin/cienfuegos/2707__cienfuegos/ |access-date=2024-02-05 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref> Since the late 1960s, Cienfuegos has become one of Cuba's main industrial centers, especially in the energy and sugar sectors.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0022216X19000920 |title=The Revolutionary City: Socialist Urbanisation and Nuclear Modernity in Cienfuegos, Cuba |journal=Journal of Latin American Studies |pages=53–76 |year=2020 |last1= Cederlöf |first1=Gustav |volume=52 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/9DC0EDBB08D100C1831FF7286B632A0D/S0022216X19000920a.pdf/revolutionary_city_socialist_urbanisation_and_nuclear_modernity_in_cienfuegos_cuba.pdf |doi-access=free }}</ref> The city is dubbed ''La Perla del Sur'' (Pearl of the South). Despite being known as an industrial city of factories and various nuclear/electrical plants, and the name ''Cienfuegos'' literally translating to "one hundred fires" (''cien'', "one hundred"; ''fuegos'', "fires"), the city actually takes its name from the surname of Asturian-born José Cienfuegos Jovellanos, [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Captain General of Cuba]] (1816–19).

Between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the city was settled by many Spaniards, mainly [[Catalans]] and [[Asturians]] who amassed fortunes as businessmen in different branches, other few of them obtained in the sugar industry, they became rich during their stay in Cuba, and they commissioned many of the most emblematic buildings of Cienfuegos<ref name="su historia"/> that remain today (See also: ''[[Indiano]]''). Other well known residents were the Irish-born John O’Bourke, he had ten children on the island, three of whom were Cuban independence fighters from the Spanish crown, the mestizos Juan O'Bourke y Palacio, Rafael O’Bourke y Borroto, and Don Miguel O’Bourke y Ramos.<ref name="su historia"/> There were also artistic personalities born in Cuba who have contributed in the cultural history of the city.

In 2005, [[UNESCO]] inscribed the ''[[Historic Centre of Cienfuegos|Urban Historic Centre of Cienfuegos]]'' on the [[World Heritage List]], citing Cienfuegos as the best extant example of early 19th century Spanish Enlightenment implementation in [[urban planning]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1202|title=Urban Historic Centre of Cienfuegos|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org|access-date=7 April 2018}}</ref> The downtown area contains six buildings from 1819–50, 327 buildings from 1851 to 1900, and 1188 buildings from the 20th century.

The area where the city lies was identified as ''Cacicazgo de Jagua'' by early Spanish conquistadors. It was originally settled by 
[[Ciboney]] ([[Taino]]) indigenous people. ''Cacicazgo'' translates from the Taino language as "chiefdom". Cacicazgo de Jagua was therefore the chiefdom of Chief Jagua.

The city was later settled by [[French people|French]] immigrants from [[Bordeaux]] and [[Louisiana]] led by Don Louis de Clouet on 22 April 1819.<ref name= guije>{{cite web|url=http://www.guije.com/pueblo/municipios/vcienfuegos/index.htm|title=Cienfuegos| website= Guije.com|access-date=2007-10-07|language=es}}</ref> The settlers named the city ''Fernandina de Jagua'' in honor of King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]] and local [[Ciboney]]an-Chief Jagua.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ojeda Cabrera|first1=Mireya|title=Cienfuegos a 190 años de fundada|url=http://www.radiorebelde.cu/de-cuba-y-de-los-cubanos/cienfuegos-190-fundada-20100518/|publisher=Radio Rebelde|access-date=23 September 2016|language=es|archive-date=24 November 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221124123631/https://www.radiorebelde.cu/de-cuba-y-de-los-cubanos/cienfuegos-190-fundada-20100518/|url-status=dead}}</ref> The settlement successively became a town (''villa'') in 1829, renamed for Asturian-born José Cienfuegos Jovellanos, [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Captain General of Cuba]] (1816–19), and a city in 1880. Many of the streets in old town reflect French origins in their names: Bouyón, D'Clouet, Hourruitiner, Gacel, and Griffo, for instance.

Cienfuegos port, despite being one of the latest settlements established during the colonial era, soon grew to be a powerful town due to the fertile fields surrounding it and its position on the trade route between [[Jamaica]] and South American cities to the southeast and the hinterland provincial capital of [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]] to the northeast. Its advantageous trading location on the historically eponymous Bay of Jagua was used by the Cuban sugar oligarchy when a railroad was built between both cities between 1853 and 1860.<ref>Santa Clara railway station (Cuba)</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Zanetti Lecuona|first1=Oscar|last2=García Alvarez|first2=Alejandro|title=Sugar & Railroads: A Cuban History, 1837–1959|date=27 June 2002|publisher=Scholarly Book Services Inc|isbn=978-0807846926|pages=51–53}}</ref>

Near Cienfuegos was the scene of a [[Battle of Cienfuegos|battle]] during the [[Spanish–American War]] on 11 May 1898, between American [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] attempting to sever underwater Spanish communication lines and the Spanish defenders.

Between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the city was settled by many Spaniards, mainly [[Catalans]] and [[Asturians]] who amassed fortunes as businessmen in different branches, other few of them obtained in the sugar industry, they became rich during their stay in Cuba, and they commissioned many of the most emblematic buildings of Cienfuegos that remain today<ref name="su historia"/> (See also: ''[[Indiano]]''). Other well known residents were the [[Irish people|Irish-born]] John O’Bourke, he had ten children on the island, three of whom were Cuban independence fighters from the Spanish crown, the mestizos Juan O'Bourke y Palacio, Rafael O’Bourke y Borroto, and Don Miguel O’Bourke y Ramos.<ref name="su historia">{{cite web  |title=Cienfuegos y su historia |website=jaguabay.com|url=https://www.jaguabay.com/cienfuegos-y-su-historia/ }}</ref> There were also artistic personalities born in Cuba who have contributed in the cultural history of the city.

The architects of Cienfuegos buildings from different centuries were Cuban-born, Italians and Spaniards architects.

During the [[Cuban Revolution]], the city saw an uprising against [[Fulgencio Batista]] and was bombed in retaliation on 5 September 1957.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://lanic.utexas.edu/la/cb/cuba/castro/1984/19840726 |title= Castro speech commemorates Moncada assault| website= lanic.utexas.edu| publisher= [[University of Texas]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060908143204/http://www1.lanic.utexas.edu/la/cb/cuba/castro/1984/19840726 |archive-date=2006-09-08 }}</ref> The city later became a key industrial center, part of the revolutionary government's "anti-urban" planning policy, with industrial projects including the never-completed [[Juragua Nuclear Power Plant|Juraguá nuclear power plant]], the "Camilo Cienfuegos" oil refinery named for [[Camilo Cienfuegos]], and the "Carlos Marx" cement factory.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0022216X19000920 |title=The Revolutionary City: Socialist Urbanisation and Nuclear Modernity in Cienfuegos, Cuba |journal=Journal of Latin American Studies |pages=53–76 |year=2020 |last1=Cederlöf |first1=Gustav |volume=52 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/9DC0EDBB08D100C1831FF7286B632A0D/S0022216X19000920a.pdf/revolutionary_city_socialist_urbanisation_and_nuclear_modernity_in_cienfuegos_cuba.pdf |doi-access=free }}</ref>

In 1969 and 1970, a [[flotilla]] of [[Soviet]] naval vessels visited the city, which included two barges used to store and transport nuclear waste and a submarine maintenance vessel. Their presence was detected by [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] [[reconnaissance aircraft]] of the [[United States Air Force]] that were sent out to monitor the Cuban coastline after a suspicious Soviet request to renegotiate the terms of the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]]–[[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] agreements of 1962 that were made in the aftermath of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], with many American intelligence analysts concluding that the [[Soviet Navy]] was planning to construct a [[submarine base]] in Cienfuegos. This was interpreted by some to be in violation of the 1962 agreements between Kennedy and Khrushchev. However, because of a [[détente]] between the Soviet Union and the United States since 1962, no major military or diplomatic confrontation ensued, and the Soviets agreed to withdraw their ships after American National Security Advisor [[Henry Kissinger]] informed Soviet ambassador to the United States [[Anatoly Dobrynin]] that the United States government believed the presence of these naval vessels to be a violation of the agreements made eight years before.<ref name="MichaelJeffreyGriesdorf2008ColdWarHistory">{{cite journal |last1=Griesdorf |first1=Michael Jeffrey |date=17 July 2008 |title=Norms as a rhetorical competition: Soviet–American confrontations over Cuba, 1970–85 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/14682740802222098 |journal=[[Cold War History (journal)|Cold War History]] |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=299–326 |doi=10.1080/14682740802222098 |s2cid=218578295 |access-date=18 February 2023}}</ref>

In 2005, [[Hurricane Dennis]] made its second [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] near Cienfuegos at about 1:00<small>PM</small> [[Atlantic Standard Time|AST]] (17:00 [[UTC]]) with winds of 232&nbsp;km/h (144&nbsp;mph) and gusts reaching 285&nbsp;km/h (177&nbsp;mph).

==Geography==
[[File:Street in Cienfuegos 2009.JPG|thumb|Tree-lined residential street in Cienfuegos in 2009]]
Near the entrance to [[Cienfuegos Bay]] is [[Castillo de Jagua]] (full name: ''Castillo de Nuestra Señora de los Angeles de Jagua''), a [[fortress]] erected in 1745 for protection against Caribbean [[pirate]]s.

Cienfuegos, one of the chief seaports of Cuba, is a center of the sugar trade as well as coffee and tobacco. While [[sugarcane]] is the chief crop, local farmers also grow coffee.
