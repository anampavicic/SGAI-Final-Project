==History==
[[File:Bản vẽ thành Mỹ Tho năm 1873.jpg|thumb|Drawing of Mỹ Tho citadel in 1873]]
Mỹ Tho was founded in the 1680s by Chinese refugees fleeing China after the fall of remnants of the [[Southern Ming]] to the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1683. The city is named after the [[Mỹ Tho River]]. In [[chữ Hán]], the name is given as {{linktext|美|萩}} (literally, beautiful tree).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nomfoundation.org/nom-tools/Nom-Lookup-Tool/Nom-Lookup-Tool |title=Vietnamese Nôm Preservation Foundation |publisher=Nomfoundation.org |access-date=2013-08-22}}</ref>

Due to its proximity to [[Saigon]], Mỹ Tho was the traditional gateway to the Mekong Delta. In the 17th century, the city had become one of the biggest commercial hubs in today's Southern Vietnam.

In the 1860s, Mỹ Tho, along with Saigon, was a major strategic city during the French colonial campaign towards Vietnam. In 1862, France's [[capture of Mỹ Tho]] is regarded as the conclusion to the establishment of the French colony of [[Cochinchina]], a development that inaugurated nearly a century of French colonial dominance in Vietnam. During the colonization period, the economy continued to prosper, attracting more immigrants, mainly from [[Chaozhou|Teochew]] and [[Minnan region|Minnan]] of mainland China.

Mỹ Tho City is recognized as a grade II on October 7, 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thevietnamguide.com/tvg/get-to-know-the-door-of-mekong-region-my-tho-city/ |title=My Tho grade II |publisher=Thevietnamguide.com |access-date=2013-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315091620/http://thevietnamguide.com/tvg/get-to-know-the-door-of-mekong-region-my-tho-city/ |archive-date=2017-03-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Administrative divisions==
Mỹ Tho is divided to 11 wards (called ''Ward 1 - Ward 10'', and ''Ward Tân Long'') and 6 communes.<ref name=amitourist>{{cite web |url=http://www.amitourist.com/Vietnam-destinations/My-tho.asp?cmd=reset |title=My Tho |publisher=Amitourist.com |access-date=2013-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111165012/http://www.amitourist.com/Vietnam-destinations/My-tho.asp?cmd=reset |archive-date=2018-01-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Mỹ Tho is connected to the rest of the country by [[National Route 1 (Vietnam)|National Route 1]] and [[Tiền River]]. Here, people mainly use motorcycles, bicycles, and boats for transportation. Mỹ Tho has the first railway route (about {{convert|70|km}} long) in Vietnam which was one of the most modern transport means in the world linking Saigon and Mỹ Tho, put into use in 1885. However, it was destroyed in the 1960s during Vietnam War.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tuoitrenews.vn/cmlink/tuoitrenews/features/the-first-railway-route-in-vietnam-1.77447 |title=The First Railway Route in Vietnam |publisher=tuoitrenews.vn }}</ref>

The [[Mekong Delta]] is considered to be the "rice basket of Vietnam", contributing more than half of the nation's rice production. Mỹ Tho is well known as floating markets, where people sell and buy things on the river, as well as Ben Tam Ngua and Mỹ Thuận market.

==Education==
Mỹ Tho was the first town in southern Vietnam to have a high school. The [[Collège]] de Mỹ Tho, opened in March 1879, is now called Nguyễn Đình Chiểu High School. It was one of the first schools Vietnam had, and even now is still known for its education quality among Southern schools.

Later, another school called "School for Gifted Students of Tien Giang" opened in Mỹ Tho city. Though the total area is very limited compared to other schools in the province, the quality of education there is usually considered one of the best. The curriculum they use is modified so that students usually learn more of their core subjects than in other schools. For instance, students from a Math class do all the required materials like any other classes, but more of Chemistry, Biology, and Physics because they are in the Natural Science block, and a lot more of Math. Preparation for national exams and entrance examination to the university are prioritized there.

Schools in Mỹ Tho are named after famous Vietnamese writers, poets, and national heroes such as [[Nguyễn Trãi]], Thu Khoa Huan is also known as Nguyen Huu Huan, [[Xuân Diệu]], [[Lê Ngọc Hân]], [[Nguyễn Đình Chiểu]], [[Trần Hưng Đạo]].

Tiền Giang College which was promoted to Tiền Giang University in 2005<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzyx5mwzGGcC&q=tien+giang+college+became+University+in+2007&pg=PA201 |title=Vietnam community colleges |isbn=9781402094774 |last1=Raby |first1=Rosalind Latiner |last2=Valeau |first2=Edward J. |date=2009-03-22 |publisher=Springer }}</ref> is also located at Mỹ Tho.

==Economy==
Today the economy of Mỹ Tho is mainly based on tourism, fishing, and agricultural products such as [[coconuts]], [[bananas]], and [[longan]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=MY THO - VIETNAM - MEKONG RIVER|url=http://www.luxurymekongrivercruise.com/destination/My-Tho.html|publisher=www.luxurymekongrivercruise.com|access-date=14 June 2015}}</ref>

During [[World War II]] the French [[Vichy government]] interned foreign nationals in Mỹ Tho. In May 1945, the Japanese seized control of the camps fearing an allied attack. [[Foreign nationals]] were confined throughout the war. As the regional capital, Mỹ Tho is the main market dealing in all the produce from the region as well as fish and other seafood from Mỹ Tho's large ocean-going fishing fleet. The very large and exuberant market is one of South Vietnam's biggest sources for [[dried fish]] and other dried seafood products such as Kho Muc ([[dried squid]]). At night the market is dedicated to the dealing and sorting of Mekong River fish, particularly [[catfish]] for Hồ Chí Minh City's wholesale markets. Produce, especially fruit and vegetables, is delivered by boat directly to markets. It is a popular starting point for tourists to take a boat trip on the Mekong River.

Mỹ Tho was the subject of "The Lesson", a chapter in a memoir by [[Tobias Wolff]], ''[[In Pharaoh's Army|In Pharaoh's Army: Memories of the Lost War]]'', describing the events of the 1968 [[Tet Offensive]] there.<ref>{{cite book |first=Tobias |last=Wolff |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4yJieb6EnSEC |title=In Pharaoh's Army: Memories of the Lost War |year=1995 |publisher=[[Alfred A.
