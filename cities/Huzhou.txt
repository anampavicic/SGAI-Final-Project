==Specialty==
*'''''Silk''''':
Huzhou is well known as one of the birthplaces for [[silk]] cultivation. In 1958, a great number of silk, silk ribbon and uncarbonized tablets were found in the southern suburbs of Huzhou. Scientists from the Institute of Archaeology measured these silk products carefully and determined the age of the silk to date back 4700 years. Now, these silk pieces have become the greatest treasures of the [[Zhejiang Silk Museum]].
Huzhou silk has many desirable features, such as paleness in color, luster, flexibility, and roundness in shape. As a result, Huzhou silk has been respected and desired for a very long time. The history of Huzhou silk can be uncovered back to the time of the Warring States (474 BC –221 BC). By the time of the Southern and [[Northern Dynasties]] (420 AD – 589 AD), Huzhou silk had already been exported to more than ten countries. During the [[Tang dynasty]] (618 AD – 907 AD), Huzhou silk was chosen for an imperial tribute, thus marking the first prosperity in silk production. With the establishment of the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368 AD – 1644 AD), the residents living near Lake Tai entered the profitable textile industry, resulting in a larger workforce and a refinement of Huzhou silk products. Huzhou silk has won awards at World Fairs, and is desired by clothing and furnishing manufacturers overseas.<ref>"huzhou silk history." baidu. baidu, 09 May 2009.

*""[[Huzhou ink brush]]""
Huzhou has a long history of manufacturing [[ink brushes]], and it can be traced back to the [[Qin dynasty]]. Huzhou's ink brush production and manufacture gained prominence in the Ming dynasty (13th century). Since the late 20th century, Huzhou has been known as the "Hometown of the Ink Brush". Huzhou also holds an annual "Huzhou Ink Brush Festival", and the festival also has some memorial activities dedicated to [[Meng Tian]] - the inventor of ink brush pen.
The most famous brush pen workshop in Huzhou could be the Shanlian ({{zh|labels=no |s=善琏 |p=Shàn Liǎn}}), thus its brush pens are named Shanlian Hubi ({{zh|labels=no |s=善琏湖笔 |p=Shànliǎn Húbǐ}}) in reverence of this workshop.
Shanlian is also a local place name, whose ancient name was Mengxi ({{zh|c=蒙溪 |l=creek of Meng Tian |links=no}}). Meng Tian made brush pens there. 
*'''''Zhou Shenji's Wonton'''''
[[File:Houzhou Zhou Shengji Hundun with flower dumplings.jpg|thumb|right|Example of Zhou Shenji Hundun with flower dumplings]]
The now popular Huzhou style [[Wonton]] dish is known to be introduced by an ingenious man named Zhouji. It is said that in 1930, Mr. Zhouji saw how profitable Ding Lianfang's roadside restaurant (began in 1878) was by serving a noodle bowl with bean curd [[dumplings]]. As a result of this observation, Zhouji also opened a store to compete for the same clients. Soon after, Mr. Zhouji found that his roadside restaurant could not replicate his competitors profit and was forced to close. However, considering what his competitor did not sell, he rethought his plans. He opened a new roadside restaurant called "Zhou Shengji's". Unlike his first venture, this one made a profit. He sold a wonton bowl with flower dumplings filled with various ingredients. The dumplings could have pork, with your choice of mix such as celery, bamboo, or spinach. And Zhou Shenji's cooks continue to be very particular about the quality of dumpling they serve. They select all the raw materials very carefully, such as wheat flower, sesame, sesame oil, wine, sugar, salt and other spices that need to be added to create the flower dumpling shell. Furthermore, Zhouji invented a special process so that dumplings do not break up easily when boiled. Combined with a special sauce, the dumplings have a satisfying taste and thus are a very popular dish.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}
