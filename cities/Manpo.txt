'''Manpo''' ({{IPA|ko|man.pʰo}}) is a city of northwestern [[Chagang]] Province, [[North Korea]]. As of 2008, it had an estimated population of 116,760. It looks across the border to the city of [[Ji'an, Jilin|Ji'an]], [[Jilin]] province, China.

==History==
Manp'o was incorporated as a city in October 1967. Earlier, in October 1949, it had been combined into a single county consisting Manpo-myon, Kosan-myon, Oegwi-myon, Iso-myon and Sijung-myon, which were split from [[Kanggye|Kanggye-gun]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=북한지역정보넷|url=http://www.cybernk.net/infoText/InfoAdminstDetail.aspx?mc=AD04&sc=A34005002&tid=AD0400044062&direct=1&direct=1|access-date=2021-12-02|website=www.cybernk.net}}</ref> Manpo had first been mentioned in 1424, in the [[Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty]]. During the Joseon Dynasty, fortresses and camps were built in this area, for which the city is now named after.<ref>{{Cite web|title=북한지역정보넷|url=http://www.cybernk.net/infoText/InfoAdminstList.aspx?mc=AD0101&direct=1&ac=%5C|access-date=2021-12-02|website=www.cybernk.net}}</ref>

==Geography==
Along the shores of the [[Yalu River]], which various tributaries flow into, and the Kŏnp'o River are the small Kosan Plain and the Kŏnha Plain.

The majority of Manpo is located at a lower height than the rest of [[Jagang Province]], though the northeast and east do have areas of higher elevation, which gradually slopes down to the much lower areas along the banks of the [[Yalu River]]. Around 75.6% of the city is covered by forests.<ref>{{Cite web|title=북한지역정보넷|url=http://www.cybernk.net/infoText/InfoAdminstList.aspx?ac=A0402&mc=AD0102&direct=1|access-date=2021-12-03|website=www.cybernk.net}}</ref>
