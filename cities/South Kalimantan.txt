The province also includes the island of [[Laut Island|''Pulau Laut'']] ("Sea Island"), located off the eastern coast of Kalimantan, as well as other smaller offshore islands. The province is divided into 11 regencies and 2 cities. South Kalimantan is the traditional homeland of the [[Banjar people]], although some parts of [[East Kalimantan]] and [[Central Kalimantan]] are also included in this criterion. Nevertheless, South Kalimantan, especially the former capital city [[Banjarmasin]] has always been the cultural capital of Banjarese culture. Many Banjarese have migrated to other parts of Indonesia, as well as neighbouring countries such as Singapore and [[Malaysia]]. In addition, other ethnic groups also inhabit the province, such as several groups of the [[Dayaks]], who mostly live in the interior part of the province, as well as the [[Javanese people|Javanese]], who mostly migrated from [[Java]] due to the [[Transmigration program]] which dated from the Dutch colonial era. It is one of the provinces in Indonesia that has a larger population than [[Mongolia]].

The territory of what is now South Kalimantan, bounced between local Kingdoms, because of its strategic location for trade, before becoming tributes to the [[Mataram Sultanate|Sultanate of Mataram]] in the 17th century, with increasing Dutch encroachment, the territory was colonized as part of the [[Dutch East Indies]] and the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]] until Indonesian Independence in 1945.

According to the mythology of the [[Ma'anyan people|Maanyan people]] (the oldest ethnic group in South Kalimantan), the first kingdom in southern Kalimantan was the Nan Sarunai Kingdom which was estimated to have territory ranging from [[Tabalong Regency|Tabalong]] to [[Paser Regency|Paser]]. The Maanyan mythology tells of the golden age of the Nan Sarunai Kingdom, uniting the Maanyan people and made connections with the island of [[Madagascar]] off the coast of Africa.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}} One of the archaeological remains from this era is the Great Temple located in the town of Amuntai.

The [[Malagasy language]] in Madagascar is similar to the [[Banjar language]]. Francois-Xavier Ricaut has shown that the [[Malagasy people]]'s genetic makeup is 68 percent of Africans and 32 percent of Asians. Based on their evidence, Banjar is the Asian group that is most likely to have traveled to Madagascar. Genetic dating supports the hypothesis that Austronesian migration occurred about 1,000 years ago, while the last significant [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] migration to Madagascar began 300 years later, after climatic change in Africa. Language shifts are thought to have occurred in Southeast Kalimantan after the Banjar migration to Madagascar. It is estimated that the [[Banjar people]], who currently speak Malay, may speak a language closer to the language reconstructed for Proto-Malagasy. This linguistic change follow the main cultural and genetic mix with [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], driven by the trade post of the Malay Empires in Southeast Kalimantan. The collapse of the Malay Empires during the 15th and 16th centuries coincide with the end of the mixture of Malay genes into the Banjar population.<ref name="No one is an island">{{cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2016-07-island-history-human-genetic-ancestry.html|title=No one is an island: The history of human genetic ancestry in Madagascar|author=Oxford University Press|date=July 5, 2016|publisher=phys.org|language=id}}</ref> Genetically, ancient Banjar tribes has a mixture of ancient Malay Dayak and Maanyan ancestry.

Maharaja Sukarama, the King of [[Negara Daha]], had the intention that his successor would be his grandson Raden Samudera, son of his daughter Puteri Galuh Intan Sari. The father of Raden Samudera was Raden Manteri Jaya, son of Raden Begawan, brother of Maharaja Sukarama. The will caused Raden Samudera to be threatened with safety because the sons of Maharaja Sukarama were ambitious as kings, namely Prince Bagalung, Prince Mangkubumi and Prince Tumenggung. Assisted by Arya Taranggana, Raden Samudra fled by boat to the lower [[Barito River|Barito river]]. After Sukarama's death, Prince Mangkubumi became King of the [[Negara Daha]], then succeeded by Prince Tumenggung who was also a son of Sukarama. Raden Samudra.

Pangeran Tumenggung attacked the Bandarmasih.

[[File:Komplek Makam Sultan Suriansyah.jpg|thumb|Sultan Suriansyah tomb complex in Banjarmasin]]
The Banjar Sultanate began experiencing its golden age in the first decade of the 17th century with pepper as a commodity of trade, with the southwest, southeast and east of the island of Borneo paying tribute to the Sultanate. Previously, the Banjar Sultanate paid tribute to the [[Demak Sultanate]], but after the fall of the Demak Sultanate and the rise of the [[Kingdom of Pajang|Pajang Sultanate]], the Banjar Sultanate no longer sent tribute to Java.<ref>Goh Yoon Pong, Trade and Politics in Bandjermasin 1700–1747, Dissertation University of London, 1969</ref>

[[Sultan Agung of Mataram]], developed his power over the island of Java by defeating the port city of the northern coast of Java such as [[Jepara]] and [[Gresik Regency|Gresik]] (1610), Tuban (1619), Madura (1624) and Surabaya (1625). In 1622, the [[Mataram Sultanate]], again planned an occupation of the kingdoms south, southwest and southeast of the island of Borneo, and Sultan Agung consolidated his authority over the Kingdom of Sukadana in 1622.<ref>(2007){{cite web|url=http://www.indonesianhistory.info/map/mataram.html?zoomview=1|title=Mataram's overseas empire|work=Digital Atlas of Indonesian History|publisher=Robert Cribb|access-date=August 11, 2011}}</ref>

In 1636, because he felt he had enough strength in the military and economy to deal with an invasion from other kingdoms, The Sultan of Banjar claimed Sambas, Lawai, Sukadana, Kotawaringin, Pembuang, Sampit, Mendawai, Kahayan Hilir and Kahayan Hulu, Kutai, Pasir, Pulau Laut, Satui, Asam Asam, Kintap and Swarangan as vassals of the Sultanate of Banjarmasin.<ref name="hikayat banjar" /><ref name="Neêrlands">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z_A_AAAAYAAJ&q=Tapesanna+Marta+Sahary&pg=PA23|title=Neêrlands vroegste betrekkingen met Borneo, den Solo-Archipel, Cambodja, Siam en Cochin-China: een nagelaten werk|last1=van Dijk|first1=Ludovicus Carolus Desiderius |author-link1=Ludovicus Carolus Desiderius van Dijk |publisher=J.

Since 1631, Banjarmasin was preparing to face an attack from the Mataram Sultanate, but due to lack of logistics, the planned attack from the Mataram Sultanate never materialised. After 1637 there was a massive migration from Java by the victims of Sultan Agung's political aggression. The arrival of immigrants from Java had a huge influence with the ports on the island of Borneo becoming the center of diffusion of [[Javanese culture]].

Besides facing an invasion plan from Mataram, the Sultanate of Banjarmasin also had to face the increasing [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] presence in the region. In 1637 Banjarmasin and Mataram held peace conference after years of tense relations.<ref name="hermanus" /> The [[Makassar War]] (1660–1669) caused many traders to move from [[Fort Somba Opu|Somba Opu]], then under the rule of the [[Sultanate of Gowa|Gowa Sultanate]] to [[Banjarmasin]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=s5FcYOTvqK8C&dq=banjarmasin%20ibukota%20negara%20indonesia&pg=PA99 {{in lang|id}} M.

Before it was divided into several small kingdoms, the Banjar Sultanate included the modern-day provinces of South Kalimantan and [[Central Kalimantan]], to the west it bordered the Kingdom of [[Tanjungpura Kingdom|Tanjungpura]] at [[Ketapang]] and to the east by the Paser Sultanate at Tanjung Aru. In the area, the local rules had the title Prince, only the Sultan of Banjar has the right to use the title Sultan. Other sultanates sent tribute to the Sultanate of Banjar, including the Paser Sultanate which was conquered in 1636 with the help of the Dutch.

Initially, the capital of the Banjar Sultanate was in Banjarmasin, but it was moved to [[Martapura, South Kalimantan|Martapura]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/londongeneralga00broogoog|quote=bendermassing.|title=The London general gazetteer; or, compendious geographical dictionary...|last=Brookes|first=Richard|publisher=T.

The Sambas and Karasikan Kingdoms sent tribute to the Sultan of Banjar. In the [[Hikayat Banjar]] also mentioned countries in Batang Lawai, Sukadana, Bunyut (Kutai Hulu) and Sewa Agung (Sawakung).

[[File:Prince Antasari Portrait from 2009 2000 rupiah bill.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Prince Antasari|Pangeran Antasari]] lead the Banjarese resistance against the Dutch during the [[Banjarmasin War]]]]

In the 18th century, Prince Tamjidullah I succeeded in gaining power to his dynasty and designated Prince Nata Dilaga as the first Sultan as Panembahan Kaharudin Khalilullah. Prince Nata Dilaga who became the first king of the Tamjidullah dynasty, declared himself as ''Susuhunan Nata Alam'' in 1772. The son of Sultan Muhammad Aliuddin Aminullah, Prince Amir, the grandson of Sultan Hamidullah fled to the Paser Kingdom, and requested assistance from his uncle, Arung Tarawe (and Queen Goddess). Prince Amir then returned and invaded the Banjar Sultanate with a large [[Buginese people|Buginese]] army in 1757, and tried to reclaim his throne from Susuhunan Nata Alam. Fearing the loss of the throne and the fall of the kingdom under the Bugis, Susuhunan Nata Alam requested assistance from the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC).

The VOC accepted the request and sent Captain Hoffman with his forces and succeeded in defeating the Buginese forces. Prince Amir was forced to flee back to the Paser Kingdom. Some time later {{when|date=February 2023}} Prince Amir tried to ask for assistance from the Banjar nobles in the [[Barito River|Barito]] area who were not happy with the Dutch presence. In this second battle, Prince Amir was captured and was exiled to [[Dutch Ceylon|Ceylon]] in 1787. After that an agreement was made between the Sultanate of Banjar and the VOC, where the kings of the Banjar ruled the kingdom as borrowers of VOC land. In 1826 a re-agreement was held between the [[Dutch East Indies]] Government and Sultan Adam, based on the previous agreement. According to the new agreement, the Dutch were allowed to interfere with the appointment of the Crown Prince and the ''Mangkubumi'', which resulted in the destruction of this royal custom, which was one of the causes of the [[Banjarmasin War]].

Pangeran Antasari also collaborated with the [[Kutai Kartanegara Sultanate|Kutai Kertanegara Sultanate]] through his relatives in [[Tenggarong]]. Pangeran Antasari wrote to other princes from Kutai such as Prince Nata Kusuma, Pangeran Anom, and Kerta. They all assisted the smuggling of firearms from Kutai to Hamlet (Banjar). However, when the Banjar War was continued by the descendants of Pangeran Antasari, The Sultan of Kutai Aji Muhammad Sulaiman did not respond positively to requests for help from Prince Perbatasari. In fact, Prince Perbatasari was handed over to the Dutch in 1885. The Dutch launched the "Expedition to the Southern and Eastern region of Borneo" ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Expeditie naar de Zuider- en Oosterafdeling van Borneo''), resulting in the destruction of the Banjar Sultanate. Resistance towards the Dutch continued until 1905, when Dutch forces under the leadership of Lieutenant Christofel veteran of the [[Aceh War]], with a large number of [[Korps Marechaussee te voet]] troops, attacked Manawing fortress in January 1905. The Korps Marechaussee te voet was a non-military corps established by the Dutch East Indies Government in 1890 to handle police duties help the military.

The Dutch annexed and placed the former territory of the Banjar Sultanate under the jurisdiction of the Residency of South and Eastern Borneo ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Residentie Zuider en Oosterafdeeling van Borneo''). In 1938, the Residency of Western Borneo ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Residentie Westerafdeeling van Borneo'') and the Residency of South and Eastern Borneo were merged into the Government of Borneo ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Gouvernement of Borneo'') with [[Banjarmasin|Bandjermasin]] as its capital ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''stadsgemeente'').

=== Japanese invasion and occupation ===
During the [[Dutch East Indies campaign]] of [[World War II]], the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] invaded Borneo. Immediately after capturing [[Balikpapan]] on January 26, 1942, the 56th Mixed Infantry Group was ordered to complete the occupation of Dutch Borneo by invading Bandjermasin, its capital. During the [[Battle of Balikpapan (1942)|Battle of Balikpapan]] and also after the occupation of the city, efforts were made to gather information from Japanese residents, natives and prisoners of war. Reconnaissance flights in the area were carried out by naval air units. It was necessary to capture Bandjermasin, as soon as possible, to secure its airfield for combat aircraft scheduled to participate in the [[Battle of Java (1942)|Java Operation]].

A Sea Drive Unit under command of Captain Yoshibumi Okamoto left Balikpapan on the evening of January 27, 1942, three days ahead of the main Land Drive Unit. The craft moved only at night and were carefully concealed in the river banks during daylight and camouflaged with mangrove branches, while the troops were resting in the forest, so that they were completely hidden from aerial reconnaissance planes. Radio silence was maintained all the time. One naval officer was attached to the unit as a pilot. The surprise night attack was successfully carried out on the town of [[Kotabaru Regency|Kotabaroe]] on [[Laut Island|Laoet Island]], as planned. Very little resistance was encountered and a large quantity of military supplies and provisions was captured.

The local administrative governor was unhappy with his territorial commander and asked the main [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL) HQ on [[Java]] for a replacement. The replacement commander was on his way by airplane, but returned as they saw Bandjarmasin was on fire and they thought, although wrongly, that it was already occupied by Japanese troops and perhaps it would be unwise to attempt a landing. The Okamoto's unit landed at a point approximately 80&nbsp;km southeast of Bandjarmasin on February 8, 1942, and advanced overland without opposition, to the airfield. As the Land Drive Unit had already dispersed the enemy, there was no fighting after the Sea Drive Unit reached the Martapoera airfield on February 10, 1942.

At 0900 on February 10, the [[Martapura, South Kalimantan|Martapoera]] airfield was captured by the Advance Force together with the Engineer Company. By the evening of February 10, with the arrival of the main force and the Sea Land Unit, Bandjermasin was finally occupied. There was no fighting.

Lieutenant Colonel H. T. Halkema came by sea to the [[Barito River]], with his staff, accompanied by elements of units under his command. By now many KNIL native soldiers had already deserted. Lieutenant Colonel Halkema received orders to proceed to Kotawarangin airfield. When he arrived there, with only 75 men left under his depleted command, he received an order to have part of his shrunken force, to staunchly defend the airfield, while those that were too weak and exhausted should to be sent to Java. Lieutenant Colonel Halkema was later court-marshalled by the military court (''Hoog Militair Gerechtshof''). In the meantime a brave group of civilians, and military escapees, 180 persons, managed to evade the Japanese aboard a small coaster to [[Madura Island|Madoera Island]], among which also included 20 women.

The official Japanese casualties during the Bandjermasin operation numbered only 9 soldiers who were killed or died from various diseases, while at least 80% of the men infected with malaria. The casualties and the number of POWs on the Dutch side are unknown. The distance travelled by land routes was approximately 400&nbsp;km and the distance through jungle approximately 100&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://warfare.gq/dutcheastindies/bandjermasin.html|title=The capture of Bandjermasin|last=L|first=Klemen|date=1999–2000|work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941–1942}}</ref>

During the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese occupation]], Borneo and eastern Indonesia were controlled by the 2nd South Fleet of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. During the occupation, the Japanese committed brutal war crimes against the local population, resulting in thousands of casualties. All of people's lives were closely monitored by the [[Kenpeitai|Kempetai]]. Towards the end of Japanese rule, many [[Rōmusha|romusha]] in the form of skeletal clad in full leather, young girls from Java and South Kalimantan themselves were made [[Comfort women|''jugun ianfu'']] (comfort women).

The Dutch remained in South Kalimantan until 1949, when the [[Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference]] resulted in the Dutch recognizing Indonesia's sovereignty. The Dutch then withdraw from the region, ending the three-century long Dutch presence in the region. The region was initially incorporated into the Indonesian province of Kalimantan, but in 1956 the province was dissolved and separated into two province, [[West Kalimantan]] and South Kalimantan. In 1957 South Kalimantan was divided to provide the Dayak population with greater autonomy from the [[Muslim]] population in the province. The change was approved by the Indonesian Government on May 23, 1957, under Presidential Law No. 10 Year 1957, which declared [[Central Kalimantan]] the seventeenth province of Indonesia.

== Geography ==
South Kalimantan is a province located on the island of Borneo, located between longitude 21 21 49 "LS, 114 19" 33 "BT – 116 33 '28 BT, and 21' 49" LS 110 "14" LS on the map.<!--what map?  What are "BT" and "LS"?  Where did this information come from?-->{{discuss}} South Kalimantan has a total area of 38,320.66&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and is divided into eleven regencies (''kabupaten'') and two independent cities (''kota'').

Geographically, South Kalimantan is in the southeastern part of the island of [[Borneo]], has a low-lying area in the west and east coast, and a plateau formed by the [[Meratus Mountains]] in the middle. South Kalimantan consists of two main geographic features, namely the lowlands and the highlands. Lowland areas are mostly in the form of peatlands to swamps, which are rich in biodiversity sources of freshwater animals. Some highland areas are still natural tropical forests and protected by the government.{{citation needed|date = May 2022}}

South Kalimantan has extensive forests namely Permanent Forests (139,315&nbsp;ha), Production Forests (1,325,024 ha), Protected Forests (139,315&nbsp;ha), Convention Forests (348,919&nbsp;ha). Forestry consists of two types, namely wood and non-wood. The area of forest in South Kalimantan is 1,659,003 ha including; protected forests, natural forests, permanent production forests, limited production forests, conversion forests and mangrove forests. Some are tropical forests and protected by the government.{{citation needed|date = May 2022}}

South Kalimantan is known as "the land of a thousand rivers", it is due to the large number of rivers in South Kalimantan. From these rivers, one of the well-known rivers is the [[Barito River]], whose name is based on the Barito region (formerly ''Onder Afdeeling Barito'') which is upstream including [[Central Kalimantan]], but is often used to name all of the watershed to its mouth at the [[Java Sea]] in South Kalimantan is called Muara Banjar/Kuala Banjar. Barito River is commonly used for buying and selling floating markets. In addition, there is also the [[Martapura River]], a tributary of the Barito, which is located in the city of Banjarmasin and in the upper part is the city of [[Martapura, South Kalimantan|Martapura]], the capital of [[Banjar Regency]].{{citation needed|date = May 2022}}

=== Climate ===
This region has a [[tropical monsoon climate|tropical savanna climate]], similar to most other Indonesian provinces. The season in West Sumatra is similar to other regions in Indonesia, only known for two seasons, namely the dry season and the rainy season. From June to September wind flows from Australia and do not contain much water vapor, resulting in a dry season. Conversely in December to March many wind currents contain water vapor from Asia and the Pacific Oceanduring the rainy season. Such conditions occur every half-year after passing the transition period in between April – May and October – November.{{Weather box|location=Banjarmasin|metric first=Yes|single line=yes|Jan high F=85|Feb high F=85|Mar high F=86|Apr high F=87|May high F=88|Jun high F=87|Jul high F=87|Aug high F=88|Sep high F=88|Oct high F=88|Nov high F=87|Dec high F=85|year high F=87|Jan low F=77|Feb low F=77|Mar low F=76|Apr low F=78|May low F=78|Jun low F=77|Jul low F=75|Aug low F=75|Sep low F=75|Oct low F=77|Nov low F=77|Dec low F=76|year low F=76|Jan precipitation mm=350|Feb precipitation mm=300|Mar precipitation mm=310|Apr precipitation mm=210|May precipitation mm=200|Jun precipitation mm=120|Jul precipitation mm=120|Aug precipitation mm=110|Sep precipitation mm=130|Oct precipitation mm=120|Nov precipitation mm=230|Dec precipitation mm=290|year precipitation mm=2570|source 1=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=58669&refer=&units=metric|date=December 2010}}As in most other province of Indonesia, South Kalimantan has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Af'') bordering on a tropical monsoon climate and [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Aw'') along the savanna grassland plains. The climate is very much dictated by the surrounding sea and the prevailing wind system. It has high average temperature and high average rainfall.{{citation needed|date = May 2022}}

== Government ==
The Province of South Kalimantan is led by a governor who is elected directly with his representative for a 5-year term. In addition to being a regional government, the Governor also acts as a representative or extension of the central government in the province, whose authority is regulated in Law No. 32 of 2004 and Government Regulation number 19 of 2010.

While the relationship between the provincial government and the regency and city governments is not a sub-ordinate, each of these regional governments governs and manages government affairs according to the principle of autonomy and co-administration.

=== Administrative Divisions ===
[[File:Kantor Gubernur Kalimantan Selatan.jpg|thumb|South Kalimantan Governor's office in Banjarmasin]]
[[File:Gedung DPRD Kalimantan Selatan (2).jpg|thumb|South Kalimantan Regional Representatives Council building in Banjarmasin]]
From the formation of the Province of South Kalimantan there were four [[Regencies of Indonesia|regencies]] (''kabupaten'') - '''Banjar''', '''Barito''', '''Kotabaru''' and '''Hulu Sungai''' - together with the independent city of '''Banjarmasin'''. However, one of these - Barito Regency - had previously been partly situated in what had become Central Kalimantan Province in 1958, and so was formed into a separate '''Barito Kuala''' Regency on 26 June 1959; on the same date, the existing Hulu Sungai Regency was split into separate regencies of '''South Hulu Sungai''', '''Central Hulu Sungai''' and '''North Hulu Sungai'''. On 14 July 1965 three further regencies were created - '''Tanah Laut''' from part of Banjar Regency, '''Tapin''' from part of South Hulu Sungai Regency, and '''Tabalong''' from part of North Hulu Sungai Regency.

A second independent city - '''Banjarbaru''' - was created on 20 April 1999, and on 25 February 2003 two additional regencies were created - '''Tanah Bumbu''' from part of Kotabaru Regency, and '''Balangan''' from part of Hulu Sungai Utara Regency. There are now therefore eleven [[Regencies of Indonesia|regencies]] (''kabupaten'') and two cities (''kota'') in South Kalimantan as listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 2020<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> Censuses together with the official estimates as at mid 2023<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Provinsi Kalimantan Selatan Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.63)</ref> and their administrative capitals.

=== Ethnicity ===
{{Main|Banjar people}}
The majority of the population of South Kalimantan is the Banjar (74.34%) consisting of three groups, namely Banjar Kuala, Banjar Pahuluan and Banjar Batang Banyu. Based on the 2010 population census the Banjar people numbered 4.1&nbsp;million. About 3&nbsp;million Banjar people live in South Kalimantan, another million Banjar people live in the other Kalimantan provinces and 500,000 other Banjars live outside Kalimantan. The Banjar people originated from the Banjar area, which is a mix of communities in several river basins, namely those of the Bahan, [[Barito River|Barito]], [[Martapura River|Martapura]] and Tabanio rivers. From this central cultural area, the Banjar tribe has since moved extensively for centrifugal migration or jumping of frogs to various regions in the archipelago to [[Madagascar]].

The second largest ethnic group is the [[Javanese language|Javanese]] (14.51%) who occupy the transmigration area. Other ethnic groups also exist in South Kalimantan. The Tionghoa Parit ([[Banjar language|Banjarese]]: ''Cina Parit'') is a sub-group of the [[Chinese Indonesians]]. They inhabit the Parit river area in Pelaihari District of [[Tanah Laut Regency]], South Kalimantan. In the daily term, the Chinese are called ''Cina Parit'' by the Banjar people and it is quite difficult for the Banjar tongue to pronounce ''Tionghoa Parit'', and in fact the Chinese people in Banjarmasin live in the Chinatown area which consists of the Pacinan Laut Village (near the river) and Pacinan Darat Village (from the river). The Chinese community call themselves as ''Tionghoa Parit'' instead of ''Cina Parit.''

The [[Dayak people|Dayak]] are also original inhabitants of the province. They occupy the [[Meratus Mountains]] region, from which the [[Barito River]] flows to [[Central Kalimantan]].

=== Language ===
The language used in everyday life by Banjarese as a mother tongue and as a lingua franca for the people of South Kalimantan generally is the [[Banjar language]], which has two major dialects, namely the Banjar Kuala dialect and the Banjar Hulu dialect.<ref>{{e22|bjn|Banjar}}</ref> [[Dayak people|Dayak]] tribes who inhabit the southern region of the Meratus Mountains speak the Dayak Meratus language.

The Dayak Dusmala (Dusun-Maanyan-Lawangan) who use the Eastern Barito languages inhabit the northern region of the Meratus Mountains; these include the Dayak Maanyan Warukin language, the Dayak Samihin language, the Dayak Dusun Deyah language, the Dayak Lawangan language, and the Dayak Abal language. The Dayak Biaju who use the Western Barito languages inhabit the basin of the [[Barito River]]; these include numerous languages, among others the Dayak Bakumpai language and the Dayak Barangas language. The [[Ngaju language|Dayak Ngaju]] language, a language originating from Central Kalimantan is used as a liturgical language in the Borneo Evangelical Church headquartered in [[Banjarmasin]].

[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] is widely used as a second language and also for inter-ethnic communication.

== Culture ==
=== Traditional Music ===
[[File:Tari Radap Rahayu.jpg|thumb|Banjarese women performing ''Tari [[Radap Rahayu]]'']]
One of the arts in the form of traditional music typical of the Banjar people is ''Panting''. This music is called ''Panting'' because it is dominated by musical instruments called panting, a type of stringed instrument that uses strings (important) so it is called important music. Initially, the music came from the [[Tapin Regency|Tapin]] area, South Kalimantan. ''Panting'' is a musical instrument that is picked which is shaped like an Arab cork but is smaller in size. In the past, ''panting'' music was only played individually or solo. The name of the important music comes from the name of the musical instrument itself, because in important music that is famous for its musical instruments and which plays a very important role. Until now, ''panting''  is still famous as traditional music originating from South Kalimantan.<ref>[http://arsyadindradi.net/sejarah-dan-peranan-musik-panting/ Musik Panting Banjar]</ref>

Besides that, there is a traditional Banjar music art, namely ''Kentung''. This music comes from the [[Banjar Regency]] area, namely in the village of Sungai Alat, Astambul and the village of Bincau, [[Martapura, South Kalimantan|Martapura]]. At present, this kentung music has begun to scarce. The past of this musical instrument was contested. In this match not only the sound, but also the things that are magical, such as if in the match this instrument can be broken or cannot be heard from the opponent's competition.<ref>[http://arsyadindradi.net/musik-kentung/ Musik Kentung Banjar]</ref>

=== Traditional Dance ===
[[File:Nanang Galuh Banjar.jpg|thumb|Banjarese traditional clothes]]
Broadly speaking, dance from South Kalimantan is from the indigenous ethnic culture of Banjar and ethnic Dayaks. Banjar dance evolved from the time of the Banjar Sultanate and was influenced by [[Javanese culture|Javanese]] and [[Malay culture]], such as ''Japin'' Dance and ''[[Baksa kembang]]'' Dance.

Banjar dance art is divided into two, namely dance developed in the palace (palace), and dance art developed by the people. Kraton dance is marked by the name "Baksa" which comes from the [[Javanese language]] (beksan) which signifies the smoothness of motion in the dance. These dances have been around for hundreds of years, since the Hindu era, but the movements and clothing have been adapted to the current situation and conditions. For example, certain movements that are considered incompatible with Islamic [[Adab (Islam)|adab]] change a little.

=== Traditional House ===
{{Main|Banjarese architecture}}
[[File:Rumah Bubungan Tinggi Anjungan Kalsel TMII Jakarta.JPG|thumb|A ''Rumah Bubungan Tinggi'']]
'''Rumah Bubungan Tinggi''' or '''Rumah Banjar''' or '''Rumah Ba-anjung''' is the most iconic type of house in South Kalimantan. In the old kingdom time, this house is the core building in a complex of a palace. This particular house is where the King and his family would reside. Since 1850, there are various building around it with their own respective functions. The name "[[Bubungan Tinggi]]" refers to its sharp roof (45 degrees steep). This type of house became so popular, that people out of the royalty also took interest in building it. Hence, there are houses with this type of architecture all over South Kalimantan, and even crossing the borders of Central Kalimantan and East Kalimantan. This type of house, of course, took more money than the usual house, so it was naturally the house of the rich.

Nowadays most [[Banjar people]] have little interest in building Bubungan Tinggi. Beside the fact that it takes a lot of money to build, people nowadays prefer the "modern" type of house. Its cultural values, however, are still appreciated. It is the main figure in both South Kalimantan and [[Banjarmasin]]'s coat of arms. Many of the modern governmental buildings are built with its traits.

=== Theater ===
[[File:Wayang Banjar HST 151102007.jpg|thumb|Banjarese men performing the ''Wayang Banjar'']]
The only traditional theater art that developed on the island of Borneo was ''Mamanda''. Mamanda is theater art or traditional performances originating from South Kalimantan. Compared to other performing arts, ''Mamanda'' is more similar to ''[[Lenong]]'' in terms of the relationship between players and spectators. This interaction made the audience become active in conveying funny comments which allegedly could make the atmosphere more lively.<ref name="Mamanda">[http://www.vivaborneo.com/mamanda-seni-pementasan-pulau-kalimantan.htm Viva Borneo – Mamanda, Seni Pementasan Pulau Kalimantan]</ref>

The difference is ''Lenong'' art is now more in line with the times than the monotonous Mamanda in the royal storyline, since in ''Mamanda'' art the characters played are standard figures such as Raja, Prime Minister, Mangkubumi, Wazir, Commander-in-Chief, First Hope, Second Hope, Khadam (Clown/aide), Empress and Sandut (Putri).<ref name="Mamanda" />

These characters must be present in every performance. In order not to be left behind, ''Mamanda's'' figures were often added with other figures such as the King from another kingdom, pirates, genie, companies and other additional figures to enrich the story.

It was alleged that the term ''Mamanda'' was used because in the play, players such as the Vizier, Minister, and Mangkubumi were called the pamanda or mamanda by the King. ''Mamanda'' etymologically consists of the word ''mama'' (mamarina) which means uncle in Banjar language and ''nda'' which means honorable. So ''mamanda'' means honorable uncle. That is "greeting" to uncles who are respected in the kinship system or family.<ref name="Mamanda" />

=== Traditional Weapon ===
''[[Kris]]'' is one of the traditional weapons in South Kalimantan. The size is at least 30&nbsp;cm long and the eyes are stuck in another. Weapons made of iron mixed with other metals.

[[Mandau (knife)|''Mandau'']], also called Parang Ilang, is a short-stemmed machete. Mandau became the main identity and weapon of the Dayak community in addition to other machete types. In general, Dayak tribes inhabiting the island of Borneo have several types of machete sharp weapons which are divided into two types, namely inland Dayak and coastal Dayak.

''Sungga'' is one of the weapons used in the [[Banjarmasin War|Banjar War]] in the Gunung Madang Fort area, Kandangan, [[South Hulu Sungai Regency|Hulu Sungai Selatan]]. This weapon was installed under a bridge that was made as a trap, so that when traversed by the enemy ([[Royal Netherlands Army|Dutch army]]), then the bridge will collapse and the enemy that fell stuck on the ''sungga''.

While fruits consist of oranges, papaya, bananas, durian, rambutan, kasturi and langsat.<ref name="BI">[http://www.bi.go.id/web/id/Publikasi/Data+dan+Informasi+Bisnis/Info+Bisnis+Regional/Publikasi/Profil/Kalsel/Ekonomi.htm Provinsi Kalimantan Selatan – Ekonomi]. Bank Sentral Republik Indonesia. Diakses pada November 21, 2012</ref> Palm oil is also common in South Kalimantan.

=== Industry ===
Industry in South Kalimantan is dominated by micro and small manufacturing industries, followed by large and medium manufacturing industries.<ref>[http://www.radarbanjarmasin.co.id/index.php/berita/detail//39/35578 Usaha Manufaktur Kalsel Naik 4,66 Persen].

=== Finance and Banking ===
Judging from its performance in 2009, banks in South Kalimantan recorded lower growth compared to the previous year as a result of the global financial crisis. However, some indicators still recorded positive growth. The volume of South Kalimantan's banking business (assets) grew 13.3% from the end of 2008 to reach Rp21.24&nbsp;trillion. This asset growth is mainly supported by credit growth and deposits.
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Schepen van de KPM langs de kade aan de Martapura-rivier Bandjermasin TMnr 60018680.jpg|thumb|Ships on the Martapura River during the Dutch colonial era]]
Public funds collected by South Kalimantan banking at the end of 2009 reached IDR 18.33&nbsp;trillion or grew by 13% (y-o-y). all types of accounts in the form of demand deposits, savings accounts, and time deposits show positive growth of 10.51% (y-o-y), 17% (y-o-y), and 5.86% (y-o-y), respectively.

Meanwhile, in terms of lending, at the end of December 2009 the amount of loans disbursed reached Rp13.95&nbsp;trillion or grew by 16% (y-o-y). This credit growth was mainly supported by consumption credit and investment credit which grew quite high at 24.81% (y-o-y) and 30.42% (y-o-y).

With these developments, the banking intermediation function reflected by the LDR (Loan to Deposit Ratio) ratio in 2009 showed an increase, from 74% in 2008 to 75.7%.

== Transportation ==
In South Kalimantan, there are various types of transportation used by the community. Comparison of the use of land and water transportation for the South Kalimantan region is quite balanced. This is due to the geographical factor of the South Kalimantan region which has many rivers and swamps, especially for the [[Banjarmasin]] area which is divided by rivers.

A road highways connects [[Palangka Raya]] in [[Central Kalimantan]] and [[Banjarmasin]]. The distance from Palangka Raya to Banjarmasin in South Kalimantan, for example, can be taken from 3 to 4 hours with a distance of about 180&nbsp;km.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://finance.detik.com/berita-ekonomi-bisnis/d-3563703/jalan-mulus-menuju-palangka-raya-yang-bebas-macet|title=Jalan Mulus Menuju Palangka Raya yang Bebas Macet|last=Simorangkir|first=Eduardo|website=detikfinance|location=[[Palangka Raya]]|publisher=[[Detik.com|detikcom]]|access-date=May 19, 2019}}</ref> Another highway also connects Banjarmasin to [[Balikpapan]] in [[East Kalimantan]]. The distance from Banjarmasin to Balikpapan can be taken around 11 to 12 hours with a distance about 470&nbsp;km. Most of the road in South Kalimantan has been asphalted, however, there are some roads in the interior part of the province that is in a very poor condition. As there are many rivers in South Kalimantan, many bridges have been built to accommodate cars. Currently, the provincial government has disbursed funds of Rp 200&nbsp;billion to continue the construction of a bridge that connects [[Kotabaru Regency|Kotabaru]] in [[Laut Island]] and [[Batulicin]] in the mainland. Construction is now still in the planning stage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kalsel.antaranews.com/berita/73905/kalsel-kucurkan-rp200-miliar-jembatan-batulicin-kotabaru|title=Kalsel kucurkan Rp200 miliar jembatan Batulicin-Kotabaru – ANTARA News Kalimantan Selatan|last=Mariono|first=Sujud|editor-last=Hanafi|editor-first=Imam|location=[[Batulicin]]|publisher=ANTARA News Agency|website=Antara News|access-date=May 19, 2019}}</ref>

[[Syamsudin Noor International Airport]] is the main airport of Banjarmasin as well as the province in a whole. The airport serves inter-island flights to other major Indonesian cities such as [[Jakarta]], [[Surabaya]] and [[Yogyakarta]]. Moreover, the airport also serves inte-Kalimantan flights to cities such as [[Pontianak, West Kalimantan|Pontianak]], [[Balikpapan]] and [[Samarinda]]. Currently, the airport is being developed. It is hoped that it can accommodate international flights in the future.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://banjarmasin.tribunnews.com/2019/05/17/progres-pengembangan-bandara-syamsudin-noor-capai-75-persen-dadang-hujan-bawa-pengaruh|title=Progres Pengembangan Bandara Syamsudin Noor Capai 75 Persen, Dadang: Hujan Bawa Pengaruh|website=Banjarmasin Post|language=id-ID|access-date=May 19, 2019}}</ref> There are other smaller airport in South Kalimantan, such as [[Gusti Syamsir Alam Airport]] in [[Kotabaru Regency|Kotabaru]] and [[Bersujud Airport]] in [[Batulicin]]. One of the main problem for air transportation in South Kalimantan is that the region is often enveloped with haze due to the forest fires.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://regional.kompas.com/read/2018/09/16/08494801/akibat-kabut-asap-lion-air-tujuan-banjarmasin-balik-arah-ke-surabaya|title=Akibat Kabut Asap, Lion Air Tujuan Banjarmasin Balik Arah ke Surabaya|last=Cipto|first=Hendra|editor-last=Krisiandi|location=[[Banjarmasin]]|publisher=Kompas Cyber Media|website=KOMPAS.com|date=September 16, 2018|language=id|access-date=May 19, 2019}}</ref>
