'''Amasya''' ({{IPA|tr|aˈmasja}}) is a city in northern [[Turkey]], in the [[Black Sea Region]]. It was called '''Amaseia''' or '''Amasia''' in antiquity.<ref name=Brit>"Amasya" in ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica|The New Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. Chicago: [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]], 15th edn., 1992, Vol. 1, p. 313.</ref> It is the seat of [[Amasya Province]] and [[Amasya District]].<ref name=il>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx İl Belediyesi], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory. Retrieved 12 January 2023.</ref> Its population is 114,921 (2021).<ref name=tuik>{{Cite web |title=Address-based population registration system (ADNKS) results dated 31 December 2021|url=https://www.tuik.gov.tr/indir/duyuru/favori_raporlar.xlsx |access-date=12 January 2023|publisher=[[TÜİK]]|language=tr |format=XLS}}</ref> Amasya stands in the mountains above the [[Black Sea]] (Karadeniz) coast, set apart from the rest of Anatolia in a narrow valley along the banks of the [[Yeşilırmak (river)|Yeşilırmak]] River. Although near the Black Sea, this area is high above the coast and has an inland climate, well-suited to growing apples, for which Amasya province, one of the provinces in north-central Anatolia Turkey, is famed. It was the home of the geographer [[Strabo]] and the birthplace of the 15th century Armenian scholar and physician [[Amirdovlat Amasiatsi]]. Located in a narrow cleft of the Yeşilırmak (Iris) river, it has a history of 7,500 years with many traces still evident today.

In antiquity, Amaseia was a fortified city high on the cliffs above the river. It has a long history as a wealthy provincial capital, producing kings and princes, artists, scientists, poets and thinkers, from the kings of [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]], through [[Strabo]] the geographer, to many generations of the Ottoman imperial dynasty. With its Ottoman-period wooden houses and the tombs of the Pontus kings carved into the cliffs overhead, Amasya is attractive to visitors. In recent years, there has been much investment in tourism, and therefore more foreign and Turkish tourists have visited the city.

During the early [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, it was customary for young Ottoman princes to be sent to Amasya to govern and gain experience. Amasya was also the birthplace of the [[Ottoman sultans]] [[Murad I]] and [[Selim I]]. Traditional [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman houses]] near the Yeşilırmak and the other main historical buildings have been restored; these traditional Yalıboyu houses are now used as cafes, restaurants, pubs and hotels. Behind the Ottoman wooden houses one can see the rock tombs of the Pontic kings.

According to [[Strabo]] the [[Greek language|Greek]] name Ἀμάσεια comes from Amasis, the queen of the [[Amazons]], who were said to have lived here. The name has changed little throughout history: Ἀμάσεια, ''Amaseia'', ''Amassia'' and ''Amasia'' are all found on ancient Greek and Roman coinage and continue to be used in modern Greek. [[Armenian language|Armenian]] Ամասիա, [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] اماسیه, and modern Turkish ''Amasya'' all represent the same pronunciation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

[[File:Statue_of_Strabo_in_Amasia.jpg|left|170px|thumb|[[Strabo]] was a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] geographer, philosopher, and historian from Amasya.]]

===Antiquity===
Archaeological research shows that Amasya was first settled by the [[Hittites]] and subsequently by [[Phrygians]], [[Cimmerians]], [[Lydians]], [[Greeks]], [[Persian people|Persians]], and [[Armenians]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

===Hellenistic period===
An independent [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontic kingdom]] with its capital at Amaseia was established by the [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Mithridatic dynasty]] at the end of the 4th century BC, in the wake of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s conquests.  In the 1st century BC, it briefly contested Rome's hegemony in Anatolia. By 183&nbsp;BC, the city was settled by Greeks, eventually becoming the capital of the Kingdom of Pontus from 333&nbsp;BC to 26&nbsp;BC. Today, there are prominent ruins including the [[Tombs of the kings of Pontus|royal tombs of Pontus]] in the rocks above the riverbank in the centre of the city. Ancient district in northeastern Anatolia adjoining the Black Sea.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

===Roman-Byzantine period===
[[File:Amasya_Museum_32.jpg|thumb|200px|A Byzantine tomb in Amasya archeological Museum]]

Amaseia was captured by a force led by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Lucullus]] in 70&nbsp;BC from [[Armenia]] and was quickly made a free city and administrative center of his new province of [[Bithynia]] and [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] by [[Pompey]]. By this time, Amaseia was a thriving city, the home of thinkers, writers and poets, and one of them, [[Strabo]], left a full description of Amaseia as it was between 60&nbsp;BC and 19&nbsp;AD. Around 2 or 3 BC, it was incorporated into the Roman province of [[Galatia (Roman province)|Galatia]], in the district of Pontus Galaticus. Around the year 112, the emperor [[Trajan]] designated it a part of the province of [[Cappadocia]].<ref>[[Strabo]] ''[[Geographica]]'', (12.561).</ref><ref name="OCD">{{Citation  | last = Mitchell | first = Stephen  | contribution = Amaseia  | year = 1996  | title = Oxford Classical Dictionary  | editor1-last = Hornblower  | editor1-first = Simon  | editor1-link =Simon Hornblower  | editor2-last = Spawforth  | editor2-first = Anthony  | editor2-link =Anthony Spawforth  | edition = 3rd  | place = Oxford  | publisher = Oxford University Press  | isbn = 978-0-19-521693-6| title-link = Oxford Classical Dictionary }}</ref> Later in the 2nd century it gained the titles '[[metropolis]]' and 'first city'. After the division of the [[Roman Empire]] by emperor [[Diocletian]] the city became part of the [[East Roman Empire]] (the [[Byzantine Empire]]). At this time it had a predominantly Greek-speaking population.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

Amaseia was also referenced in the first book of the [[Alexiad]]. Amaseia was the town where [[Alexios I Komnenos|Emperor Alexios I Komnenos]] received the Norman general [[Roussel de Bailleul|Ursel]] as a captive from the Turkic general Tutach. Ursel had, according to the book, looted and pillaged the Eastern provinces of the Byzantine Empire until the at-the-time General Alexios convinced Tutach to capture him. Alexios agreed that he would pay "...such a sum of money as no one ever gained before." to Tutach for the capture of Ursel, however Alexios had no cash to give and the Emperor was unable to fund it, so he attempted to raise money from the people of Amaseia, however this caused serious unrest. However, after a speech by Alexios, he arranged a mock-blinding of Ursel which promptly caused the people to contribute funds. However, this is likely to be biased.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Alexiad, translated by Elizabeth A. S. Dawes &#124; Anna Comnena; Dawes, Elizabeth A. S. (trans.)}}</ref>

Saints [[Theodore of Amasea]] (died by 319), a warrior saint, and the local bishop [[Asterius of Amasea]] (died {{Circa|410}}), some of whose polished sermons survive, are notable Christian figures from the period.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

In 1075, ending 700 years of Byzantine rule, Amasya was conquered by the [[Oghuz Turks|Turkmen]] [[Danishmends|Danishmend]] emirs.<ref name="EI2">{{EI2 | last = Taeschner | first = Fr. | authorlink = | title =  Amasya | volume = 1 | pages = 431–432 | doi =10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_0583 }}</ref> It served as their capital until the annexation of the Danishmendid dominions by the [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuk]] ruler [[Kilij Arslan II]].<ref name="EI2"/> When he died, his realm was divided among his sons, and Amasya passed to [[Nizam ad-Din Arghun Shah]]. His rule was brief, as he lost it to his brother [[Rukn ad-Din Suleiman Shah]], who subsequently became Sultan.<ref name="EI2"/> During the 13th century the city passed under the control of the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] [[Ilkhanate]], and was ruled by Mongol governors, except for a brief rule by [[Taj ad-Din Altintash]], son of the last Seljuk sultan, [[Mesud II]].<ref name="EI2"/>
 
Under the Seljuks and the Ilkhan, the city became a centre of Islamic culture and produced some notable individuals such as [[Yaqut al-Musta'simi]] (1221–1298) calligrapher and secretary of the last Abbasid caliph who was a [[Greeks|Greek]] native of Amasya.<ref name="Houtsma 1987">{{cite book |title=E.J.

In 1341, the emir [[Habiloghlu]] occupied the city, before it came under the rule of the [[Eretnid]] emirate. [[Shadgeldi|Hadji Shadgeldi Pasha]] took Amasya from the Eretnids under Ali Bey, and successfully fended off the claims of [[Kadi Burhan al-Din]], who had supplanted the Eretnids.<ref name="EI2"/> Shadgeldi was succeeded by his son Ahmed, who managed to retain his autonomy for a while, with Ottoman assistance; but in 1391/92, the [[Battle of Kırkdilim|mounting pressure]] forced him to cede the city to the Ottoman sultan [[Bayezid I]], who installed his son, the future [[Mehmed I]], as its governor.<ref name="EI2"/><ref>{{cite book | last = Kastritsis | first = Dimitris | title = The Sons of Bayezid: Empire Building and Representation in the Ottoman Civil War of 1402-13 | publisher = BRILL | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-90-04-15836-8 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=u_evCQAAQBAJ | page=65}}</ref>

As a result, the city enjoyed a special status under the Ottomans.<ref name="EI2"/> A number of Ottoman princes were sent to the province of Amasya (the [[Rûm Eyalet]]) as governors in their youth, from Mehmed II in the late 14th century to [[Bayezid II]] in the 15th century, through to [[Murat III]] in the 16th century.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

[[Suleiman the Magnificent]] often stayed in the city, and even received the [[Habsburg monarchy|Habsburg]] ambassador [[Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq]] there.<ref name="EI2"/> Already distinguished a cultural centre under the Seljuks, Amasya now "became one of the main seats of learning in Anatolia".<ref name="EI2"/>

Between 1530 and 1545, several travelers documented a [[blood libel]] against some of the town's [[Jews]].<ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com">{{Cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1367-amasia-amasieh|title=AMASIA, AMASIEH - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=jewishencyclopedia.com|access-date=2017-12-02}}</ref> After the disappearance of a local [[Christians|Christian]], several [[Jews]] living in town were blamed for killing him for ritual reasons.

The population of Amasya at this time was very different from that of most other cities in the Ottoman Empire, as it was part of their training for the future sultans to learn about every nation of the Empire. Every [[millet system|millet]] of the Empire was represented in Amasya in a particular village—such as a Greek village, an Armenian village, a Bosnian village, a Tatar village, a Turkish village etc. (see: 1927 Population count data by DİE)

In 1919 Amasya was the location of the final planning meetings held by Mustafa Kemal [[Atatürk]] for the building of a Turkish army to establish the Turkish republic following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the end of the First World War. It was here that Mustafa Kemal made the announcement of the [[Turkish War of Independence]] in the [[Amasya Circular]]. This circular is considered as the first written document putting the Turkish War of Independence in motion. The circular, distributed across Anatolia, declared Turkey's independence and integrity to be in danger and called for a national conference to be held in [[Sivas]] ([[Sivas Congress]]) and before that, for a preparatory congress comprising representatives from the eastern provinces of Anatolia to be held in [[Erzurum]] in July ([[Erzurum Congress]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

During the years of [[World War I]] and the [[Turkish War of Independence]], the Christian inhabitants of Amasya (Armenian and Greek) suffered from atrocities. Many Armenian civilians fleeing the attacks sought refuge at the American missionary school [[Anatolia College]], located in [[Merzifon]] outside Amasya. In 1921, Turkish troops closed down the school, and the local population relocated to [[Thessaloniki]] after the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]].<ref>Carl C. Compton (2008), The Morning Cometh: 45 Years with Anatolia College, pp. 88-98.</ref> Also, in 1921 there was the [[Amasya trials]] which were special ad hoc trials, organized by the [[Turkish National Movement]], with the purpose to kill the Greek representatives of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] region under a legal pretext.<ref name=Hofmann208>Hofmann, p. 208</ref>

In the 10th century the metropolis ranked 11th among the metropolises of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. From the 12th century the Christian element was reduced due to the [[Turkic migration]]s into Anatolia. The Orthodox metropolis of Amasea was active until the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] (1923) and in 1922 counted c. 40,000 Christians, 20,000 of them being Greek speakers. Last active metropolitan bishop was [[Germanos Karavangelis]].<ref name="ehw"/>

No longer being a residential diocese, Amasea is today listed by both the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 821</ref>

== The legend of Ferhat and Shirin ==
In its Turkish version, this classic tale of oriental folklore is held to have taken place in Amasya. The nearby mountain ''Ferhat'' is named for [[Farhad]] (Turkish spelling Ferhat), the hero of the legend, who for love of the princess [[Shirin]] (Turkish spelling Şirin) tried to win her father's favour and permission by tunnelling through the mountain to bring spring water to his palace. Sadly, while he was working he was sent the false information that Shirin had died; upon which he threw himself onto the rocks in his grief. And his beloved princess died soon after. The story has since become a play by [[Nâzım Hikmet]], a novel by [[Talip Apaydın]], and an opera by [[Arif Melikov]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

== Climate ==
Amasya has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] (Csa) under [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] classification and a hot summer oceanic climate (Doa) under the [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]] classification.

It is warmer than central Anatolia, and its weather is not as cold in winter months. It has features of both the oceanic climate of the Black Sea and a continental Mediterranean climate.

== Geography ==
Situated between the [[Black Sea]] and inner [[Anatolia]] in a region of fertile plains irrigated by the [[Tersakan]], [[Çekerek]] and [[Yeşil River|Yeşilırmak]] rivers, Amasya lies in a beautiful narrow river valley, bounded by almost vertical cliffs and the high peaks of the [[Canik]] and [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] mountains. Despite the mountainous location, it is not far above sea level. This makes its climate more temperate.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

Five bridges cross the river, and most of the town lies on the southern bank, spread along the river. The climb up to the higher ground is very steep, making the valley walls virtually uninhabitable. The town is shaped like the letter 'v' as it follows a sharp bend in the river.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}
