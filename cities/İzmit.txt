İzmit was known as [[Nicomedia]] ({{lang-grc-gre|Νικομήδεια}}) and Ólbia ({{lang-grc-gre|Ὀλβία}}) in antiquity, and was the eastern and most senior capital city of the [[Roman Empire]] between 286 and 324, during the [[Tetrarchy]] introduced by [[Diocletian]]. Following [[Constantine the Great]]'s victory over co-emperor [[Licinius]] at the [[Battle of Chrysopolis]] in 324, Nicomedia served as an interim capital city for Constantine between 324 and 330, when he rebuilt and expanded the nearby city of [[Byzantium]] as the new Roman capital; formally dedicating it in 330 with the name ''[[New Rome|Nova Roma]]'',<ref name="Britannica-Istanbul">{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Istanbul|title=Istanbul|website=britannica.com|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|access-date=28 May 2021|archive-date=1 April 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401050737/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/296962/Istanbul/12387/Administration-and-social-conditions|url-status=live}}</ref> before he soon renamed it as ''[[Constantinople|Constantinopolis]]'' (modern [[Istanbul]]).<ref name="Britannica-Istanbul"/> Constantine died at a royal villa near Nicomedia in 337. During the [[Ottoman Empire]], İzmit was the capital of the [[Sanjak of Kocaeli]].

==Name==
"''İzmit''" derives from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] name of the city, [[Nicomedia]] ({{langx|el|Νικομήδεια}}), prefixed with εἰς 'to' or 'into' 
(similarly to [[Names of Istanbul#Istanbul|İstanbul]]). Names used in English prior to official Turkish [[Romanization|Latinization]] include ''Ismid'', ''Iskimid'', and ''Isnikmid''.<ref name="eb1911">{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWIgAQAAMAAJ&q=ismid&pg=PA388|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica: A-ZYM|first1=Day Otis|last1=Kellogg|first2=Thomas Spencer|last2=Baynes|date=13 December 1903|publisher=Werner|via=Google Books|access-date=4 January 2021|archive-date=21 July 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210721170824/https://books.google.com/books?id=BWIgAQAAMAAJ&q=ismid&pg=PA388|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Geography==
The geographical location of İzmit is between 40°-41° N and 29°-31° E, surrounded by the [[Gulf of İzmit]] at south, [[Istanbul]] and the [[Sea of Marmara]] at west, the [[Black Sea]] at north, and [[Sakarya Province|Sakarya]] at east.

The city is mostly built on hill slopes because of the cramped area, while flat plains surround the gulf, near the sea. This topographic structure divided the city into two parts. The first was created on flat plains, where the city center is located. The railway and highway networks pass from this area which is close to the Sea of Marmara. The second part was built on hills, with many historic houses from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period in the old quarters.

In Antiquity, the city in Greek was called [[Astacus (Bithynia)|Astacus]] or Olbia (founded 712 BC). After being destroyed, it was rebuilt and founded by [[Nicomedes I of Bithynia]] in 264 BC under the name of [[Nicomedia]]. It remained one of the most important cities in northwestern [[Asia Minor]].

[[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] general and statesman [[Hannibal]] came to Nicomedia in his final years and committed suicide in nearby [[Libyssa]] (modern [[Gebze]]), in a date between 183 and 181 BC.

The historian [[Arrian]] was born in Nicomedia, which was the metropolis of [[Bithynia]] under the [[Roman Empire]] (see also [[İznik|Nicaea]]).

In 286 AD, Roman emperor [[Diocletian]] made Nicomedia the eastern capital city of the Roman Empire, when he introduced the [[Tetrarchy]] system. Nicomedia remained as the eastern (and most senior) capital of the Roman Empire until [[Licinius]] was defeated by [[Constantine the Great]] in 324. Constantine mainly resided in Nicomedia as his interim capital city for the next six years; until in 330 he declared the nearby [[Byzantium]] as ''Nova Roma'', which eventually became known as [[Constantinople]] (modern [[Istanbul]]). Constantine died at an imperial villa in the vicinity of Nicomedia on 22 May 337. Owing to its position at the convergence of the Asiatic roads leading to the new capital, Nicomedia retained its importance even after the foundation of Constantinople.

In 451, the local bishopric was promoted to a [[Metropolis of Nicomedia|Metropolitan see]] under the jurisdiction of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Kiminas|first=Demetrius|title=The Ecumenical Patriarchate|year=2009|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|isbn=9781434458766|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QLWqXrW2X-8C&q=pergamos+metropolitanate&pg=PA81|pages=79|access-date=4 October 2020|archive-date=23 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211023143233/https://books.google.com/books?id=QLWqXrW2X-8C&q=pergamos+metropolitanate&pg=PA81|url-status=live}}</ref>

Nicomedia remained under [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rule until the late 11th century, when it was captured by [[Seljuk Turks]]. However, the city soon returned to Byzantine sovereignty as a consequence of the successes of the [[First Crusade]]. After the [[sack of Constantinople]] in 1204, during the [[Fourth Crusade]], the city of Nicomedia, with most of the [[Bithynia]] province, became a part of the [[Latin Empire]]. It was recaptured by the [[Empire of Nicea|Byzantines]] around 1235 and stayed within Byzantine borders until the first half of the 14th century. The city was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1337.

In the early 20th century, it remained the seat of a [[pasha]], a Greek [[Metropolitan bishop#Eastern Orthodox|metropolitan]], and an [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian]] archbishop.<ref name="eb1911"/>

The 7.6 {{M|w}} [[1999 İzmit earthquake|earthquake of 17 August 1999]] devastated the region with a maximum [[Mercalli intensity scale|Mercalli intensity]] of IX (Violent). The shock killed more than 17,000 people and left half a million homeless. It took several years for the city to recover from this disaster, and traces of the earthquake remain visible.

İzmit has a history as a [[port city]]. As of 1913, the Turkish government had been working to [[privatization|privatize]] the port. At that time, [[Vickers]] built a temporary dock, bringing a small export business to the area. The British described the port as having little business as of 1920.<ref name=Prothero74/>

During the sanjak period of İzmit, the forested regions of the area were devastated by [[deforestation]]. The wood in the region of İzmit was used to produce [[charcoal]], primarily.<ref name=Prothero97>{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Anatolia|year=1920|publisher=H.M.

Factories were rare during that time, so most linen was handmade. It was described as being "coarse" and as being in high demand in Turkey as of 1920. İzmit was the home of two [[Turkish Army]] and [[Turkish Navy|Navy]] [[uniform]] factories. One made [[fez (hat)|fez]] hats and the other made cloth. The area made [[carpet]] and [[embroidery]], made by mainly Christian women.<ref name=Prothero109>{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Anatolia|year=1920|publisher=H.M.

İzmit has a large [[oil refinery]] and major paper and cement factories. [[Ford Motor Company]] has a plant here in a joint venture with [[Otosan]], assembling the [[Ford Transit|Transit/Tourneo]] (including the new V362 Transit/Tourneo Custom since late 2012) and [[Ford Transit Connect|Transit/Tourneo Connect]] vans. After Ford's Southampton Assembly Plant's closure scheduled for July 2013 was completed, and the launch of the new Otosan only V363 Transit in 2014, İzmit became the sole producer of Ford Transit vans for Europe. It is also a transportation hub, being on the main highway and railway lines between Istanbul and [[Ankara]] and having a major [[port]].

In the past few years the province has developed into a growth point for the Turkish [[Automaker|automotive industry]], receiving investments from [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]], [[Honda]] and [[Isuzu]]. Tyre and rubber products are produced to world-class standard ([[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]], [[Pirelli]], [[Sabancı Holding|Lassa]] and [[Bridgestone]]). As of today, Kocaeli province has attracted more than 1200 industrial investments, 108 of which have been established with international capital. Turkey's largest enterprise, the Tüpraş Petroleum Refinery Plant, is in Kocaeli, containing altogether 27% of the national chemical products industry, including petrochemical products. Eighteen of the 100 largest enterprises of Turkey are in Kocaeli and contribute to around 17%-18% of the national tax revenues.

The main transportation routes, the [[State road D100 (Turkey)|D100]] highway and the [[Trans European Motorway]] which connects Europe with Asia, along with railway lines, form an intercontinental passage network. [[İzmit Central railway station]] is one of the busiest in Turkey<!--according to its article! -->, built in 1977 to replace the original station.

Kocaeli neighbours one of the world's largest metropolitan centers, [[Istanbul]]. Its vicinity to Istanbul's two international airports ([[Sabiha Gökçen International Airport]] and [[Atatürk International Airport]]) which are {{convert|45|and|80|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} away, respectively, from İzmit's city center, provides national and international connections.

On 1 March 1958, {{SS|Üsküdar}}, a small passenger ferry sailing between İzmit and [[Değirmendere, Gölcük|Değirmendere]] sank due to [[lodos]] weather. 272 people died including 38 students and seven crew. 37 passengers and two crew survived the disaster.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denizgazete.com/yazar/100248/28/-denizhaber-yazar-denizcilik-yazarlari |publisher=Deniz Gazete |title=S/S Üsküdar 1927-1958 |author=Bozoğlu, Ali |language=tr |access-date=22 August 2012 |archive-date=29 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029121006/http://www.denizgazete.com/yazar/100248/28/-denizhaber-yazar-denizcilik-yazarlari |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://gundem.milliyet.com.tr/batan-uskudar-vapuru-nun-kaptaninin-mezari-yeniden-acildi/gundem/gundemdetay/15.11.2011/1463198/default.htm |newspaper=[[Milliyet]] |title=Batan Üsküdar Vapuru'nun kaptanının mezarı yeniden açıldı |author=Gülezer, Soner |date=15 November 2011 |language=tr |access-date=22 August 2012 |archive-date=23 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211023143235/https://www.milliyet.com.tr/son-dakika-haberleri/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/fotohaber/yasam/uskudar_vapuru_faciasinin_53_yili/29538 |newspaper=[[Sabah (newspaper)|Sabah]] |title=Üsküdar Vapuru faciasının 53. yılı-Cumhuriyet tarihinin en yüksek ölümlü deniz kazası |date=1 March 2011 |language=tr |access-date=22 August 2012 |archive-date=9 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009072900/http://www.sabah.com.tr/fotohaber/yasam/uskudar_vapuru_faciasinin_53_yili/29538 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.skyturk360.com/haberdetay.asp?id=2536 |newspaper=SkyTürk 360 |title=Üsküdar Vapuru faciasının 54. yılı...  |date=1 March 2012 |language=tr |access-date=22 August 2012 }}</ref>

==Education==
[[File:Historical_school_yenituran_*©Abdullah_Kiyga_-_panoramio.jpg|thumb|A pre-school building in İzmit]]

[[Kocaeli University]] (KOU) was established in the city in 1992. The university has more than 50,000 students. It has established a department of international relations that monitors [[Bologna Process|Bologna developments]] closely and oversees KOU's participation in the Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci student mobility schemes. With membership in the European University Association, KOU is aiming for greater international recognition of its academic work.

The university, while focusing on technical and engineering subjects, offers an extensive selection of courses in social sciences and arts as well. Some steps toward certification by ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) are being taken by the Faculty of Engineering, such as adaptation of course content in engineering majors.

==Climate==
İzmit has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa,'' [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Cf''), which is warmer than its surroundings – largely due to its sheltered location – and noticeably wetter during summers than other locations on the northern Sea of Marmara coast further to the west. Summers are hot and often muggy, the average maximum temperature is around {{convert|30|°C|0|abbr=on}} in July and August, while winters are cool and wet, the average minimum temperature is between {{convert|0-4|°C|0|abbr=on}} in January. Precipitation is high and fairly evenly distributed the year round; it is heaviest in late fall and winter. İzmit has a record high temperature of {{convert|44.1|°C|0|abbr=on}} in July 2000, which is exceptionally high for the region, and a record low of {{convert|-18.0|°C|0|abbr=on}} in February 1929. Snowfall is fairly common, and İzmit's snow depth record is {{convert|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} in February 1929.
