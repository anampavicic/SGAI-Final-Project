Situated around a high plateau by the banks of the [[Tigris]] river on which stands the historic [[Diyarbakır Fortress]], it is the administrative capital of the [[Diyarbakır Province]] of southeastern [[Turkey]]. It is the second-largest city in the [[Southeastern Anatolia Region]]. As of December 2021, the Metropolitan Province population was 1,791,373 of whom 1,129,218 lived in the built-up (or metro) area made of the 4 urban districts ([[Bağlar, Diyarbakır|Bağlar]], [[Kayapınar, Diyarbakır|Kayapınar]], [[Sur, Diyarbakır|Sur]] and [[Yenişehir, Diyarbakır|Yenişehir]]).

Diyarbakır has been a main focal point of the [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (1978–present)|conflict]] between the Turkish state and various [[Kurds in Turkey|Kurdish]] separatist groups, and is seen by many Kurds as the de facto capital of [[Kurdistan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/tensions-increase-already-fragile-kurdish-peace-process-faulters-turkey|title=Tensions increase as already fragile Kurdish peace process faulters in Turkey|website=Middle East Eye}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/24/world/europe/an-aleppo-like-landscape-in-a-kurdish-redoubt-of-turkey.html|title=An Aleppo-like Landscape in a Kurdish Redoubt of Turkey|newspaper=The New York Times|date=24 December 2016|last1=Nordland|first1=Rod}}</ref> The city was intended to become the capital of an [[Kurdish independence|independent Kurdistan]] following the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], but this was disregarded following subsequent political developments.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kubilay|first=Arin|date=2015-03-26|title=Turkey and the Kurds -- From War to Reconciliation?|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3229m63b|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Köksal|first=Yonca|date=2005|title=Hakan Özoğlu.

In November 1937, Turkish President [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]] visited the city and after expressing uncertainty on the exact etymology of the city's name, "Diyarbekir", in December of the same year ordered that it be renamed "Diyarbakır", which means "land of copper" in Turkish after the abundant resources of [[copper]] around the city.<ref>See [[Uğur Ümit Üngör|Üngör, Uğur]] (2011), ''The Making of Modern Turkey: Nation and State in Eastern Anatolia, 1913–1950''.

People have inhabited the area around Diyarbakır since the Stone Age. The first major civilization to establish itself in the region of Diyarbakır was the [[Hurrians|Hurrian]] kingdom of the [[Mitanni]]. It was then ruled by a succession of nearly every polity that controlled [[Upper Mesopotamia]], including the [[Arameans]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Urartu]], [[Armenians]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persians]], [[Medes]], [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]], and [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]].<ref>[[Trevor Bryce]], ''The Kingdom of the Hittites'', 1999 p. 137</ref> The [[Roman Republic]] gained control of the city in 66 BC, by which stage it was named "Amida".<ref>[http://italian.classic-literature.co.uk/history-of-rome/05-the-establishment-of-the-military-monarchy/ebook-page-24.asp Theodor Mommsen History of Rome, The Establishment of the Military Monarchy].

According to the ''[[Synecdemus]]'' of [[Hierocles (author of Synecdemus)|Hierocles]], as Amida, Diyarbakır was the major city of the [[Roman province]] of [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]].<ref name=":1">{{cite web|last=Nicholson|first=Oliver|title=Mesopotamia, Roman|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198662778.001.0001/acref-9780198662778-e-3135|work=The Oxford Dictionary of Late Antiquity|year=2018|editor-last=Nicholson|editor-first=Oliver|edition=online|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780198662778.001.0001|isbn=978-0-19-866277-8|access-date=2020-11-28}}</ref> It was the [[episcopal see]] of the Christian [[diocese]] of Mesopotamia.<ref name=":1" /> Ancient texts record that ancient Amida had an [[amphitheatre]], ''[[thermae]]'' (public baths), warehouses, a [[tetrapylon]] monument, and [[Roman aqueducts]] supplying and distributing water.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|last=Keser-Kayaalp|first=Elif|title=Amida|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198662778.001.0001/acref-9780198662778-e-207|work=The Oxford Dictionary of Late Antiquity|year=2018|editor-last=Nicholson|editor-first=Oliver|edition=online|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780198662778.001.0001|isbn=978-0-19-866277-8|access-date=2020-11-28}}</ref> The Roman historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] was serving in the [[late Roman army]] during the [[Siege of Amida (359)|Siege of Amida]] by the [[Sasanian Empire]] under [[Shapur II]] ({{Reign|309|379}}), and described the successful siege in detail.<ref name=":2" /> Amida was then enlarged by refugees from ancient Nisibis ([[Nusaybin]]), which the emperor [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]] ({{Reign|363|364}}) was forced to evacuate and cede to Shapur's Persians after the defeat of his predecessor [[Julian's Persian War]], becoming the main Roman stronghold in the region.<ref name=":2" /> The [[chronicle]] attributed to [[Joshua the Stylite]] describes the capture of Amida by the Persians under [[Kavad I]]  ({{Reign|488|531}}) in the second [[Siege of Amida (502–503)|Siege of Amida]] in 502–503, part of the [[Anastasian War]].<ref name=":2" />

Either the emperor [[Anastasius Dicorus]] ({{Reign|491|518}}) or the emperor [[Justinian the Great]] ({{Reign|527|565}}) rebuilt the walls of Amida, a feat of defensive architecture praised by the Greek historian [[Procopius]].<ref name=":2" /> As recorded by the works of [[John of Ephesus]], [[Zacharias Rhetor]], and Procopius, the Romans and Persians continued to contest the area, and in the [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628]] Amida was captured and held by the Persians for twenty-six years, being recovered in 628 for the Romans by the emperor [[Heraclius]] ({{Reign|610|641}}), who also founded a church in the city on his return to [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) from Persia the following year.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

[[Syriac Christianity]] took hold in the region between the 1st and 4th centuries AD, particularly amongst the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] of the city. The [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Theodosius II]] (408–450) divided the [[Roman province]] of [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]] into two, and made Amida the capital of Mesopotamia Prima, and thereby also the [[metropolitan see]] for all the province's [[bishopric]]s.<ref name="edwards">{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W. |entry=Diyarbakır |encyclopedia=The Eerdmans Encyclopedia of Early Christian Art and Archaeology |editor=Paul Corby Finney |date=2016 |publisher=William B.

At some stage, Amida became a see of the [[Armenian Church]]. The bishops who held the see in 1650 and 1681 were in [[full communion]] with the [[Holy See]], and in 1727 Peter Derboghossian sent his profession of faith to Rome. He was succeeded by two more bishops of the [[Armenian Catholic Church]], Eugenius and Ioannes of [[Smyrna]], the latter of whom died in [[Constantinople]] in 1785.

In 639, as part of the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant]] during the early [[Arab–Byzantine wars]], Amida fell to the armies of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] led by [[Iyad ibn Ghanm]], and the Great Mosque of Amida was constructed afterwards in the city's centre, possibly on the site of the Heraclian Church of Saint Thomas.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":10" /> There were as many as five Christian [[monasteries]] in the city, including the [[Zuqnin Monastery]] and several ancient churches mentioned by John of Ephesus.<ref name=":2" /> One of these, the [[St. Mary Church, Diyarbakır|Church of the Virgin Mary]], remains the city's [[cathedral]] and the see of the [[bishop of Diyarbakır]] in the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]].<ref name=":2" /> Another ancient church, the Church of Mar Cosmas, was seen by the British explorer [[Gertrude Bell]] in 1911 but was destroyed in 1930, while the former [[Church of Saint George, Diyarbakır|Church of Saint George]], in the walled citadel, may originally have been built for Muslim use or for the [[Church of the East]].<ref name=":2" />

The city was part of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] and then the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], but then came under more local rule until its recovery in 899 by forces loyal to the caliph [[al-Mu'tadid]] ({{Reign|892|902}}) before falling under the sway of first the [[Hamdanid dynasty]] and then the [[Buyid dynasty]], followed by a period of control by the [[Marwanids (Diyar Bakr)|Marwanids]].

The [[Classical Age of the Ottoman Empire]] saw it expand into [[Western Armenia]] and all but the eastern regions of [[Kurdistan]] at the expense of the Safavids. From the early 16th century, the city and the wider region was the source of intrigue between the Safavids and the [[Ottoman Empire]], both of whom sought the support of the Kurdish chieftains around [[Idris Bitlisi]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Özoğlu|first=Hakan|title=Kurdish Notables and the Ottoman State: Evolving Identities, Competing Loyalties, and Shifting Boundaries|date=2004-02-12|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-5993-5|pages=47–49|language=en}}</ref> It was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1514 in the campaigns of [[Bıyıklı Mehmed Pasha]], under the rule of Sultan [[Selim I]].

Following their victory, the Ottomans established the [[Diyarbekir Eyalet]] with its administrative centre in Diyarbakır. The Eyalet of Diyarbakır corresponded to today's [[Turkish Kurdistan]], a rectangular area between the [[Lake Urmia]] to [[Palu (District), Elazığ|Palu]] and from the southern shores of [[Lake Van]] to [[Cizre]] and the beginnings of the [[Syrian desert]], although its borders saw some changes over time. The city was an important military base for controlling the region and at the same time a thriving city noted for its craftsmen, producing glass and metalwork. For example, the doors of [[Rumi]]'s tomb in [[Konya]] were made in Diyarbakır, as were the gold and silver decorated doors of the tomb of [[Ebu Hanife]] in [[Baghdad]]. Ottoman rule was confirmed by the 1555 [[Peace of Amasya]] which followed the [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1532–1555)]].

Concerned with independent-mindedness of the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] principalities, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] sought to curb their influence and bring them under the control of the central government in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]. However, removal from power of these hereditary principalities led to more instability in the region from the 1840s onwards. In their place, [[sufi]] sheiks and religious orders rose to prominence and spread their influence throughout the region. One of the prominent Sufi leaders was ''[[Sheikh Ubeydullah|Shaikh Ubaidalla]] Nahri'', who began a revolt in the region between Lakes [[Lake Van|Van]] and [[Lake Urmia|Urmia]]. The area under his control covered both Ottoman and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] territories. Shaikh Ubaidalla is regarded as one of the earliest proponents of [[Kurdish nationalism]]. In a letter to a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] Vice-Consul, he declared: "The Kurdish nation is a people apart... we want our affairs to be in our hands."

A 2018 report by Arkeologlar Derneği İstanbul found that, since 2015, 72% of the city's historic [[Sur, Diyarbakır|Sur district]] had been destroyed through demolition and redevelopment, and that laws designed to protect historic monuments had been ignored. They found that the city's "urban regeneration" policy was one of demolition and redevelopment rather than one of repairing cultural assets damaged during the recent civil conflict, and because of that many registered historic buildings had been completely destroyed. The extent of the loss of non-registered historic structures is unknown because any historic building fragments revealed during the demolition of modern structures were also demolished.<ref name="arkeologlardernegist.org">{{Cite web|url=https://www.arkeologlardernegist.org/aciklama.php?id=31|title=Açıklama|website=www.arkeologlardernegist.org}}</ref> As of 2021, large parts of the city and district were  restored and government officials were looking towards tourism again.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.diyarbakirsoz.com/diyarbakir/hedef-5-milyon-turist-getirmek-221044|title=Hedef 5 milyon turist getirmek|date=19 March 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.haberturk.com/diyarbakir-haberleri/85587349-tarihi-diriltecek-dev-projenin-2-etabi-basladiunesco-dunya-kultur-mirasi-listesinde-bulunan|title=Tarihi diriltecek dev projenin 2.
