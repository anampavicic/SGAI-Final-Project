{{for timeline|Timeline of Kobe}}

===Origins===
Tools found in western Kobe demonstrate the area was populated at least from the [[Jōmon period]].<ref name="oldkobehistory">[http://www.city.kobe.jp/cityoffice/15/020/youran/rekishi.html City of Kobe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918145414/http://www.city.kobe.jp/cityoffice/15/020/youran/rekishi.html |date=September 18, 2007 }} – "Kobe's History" (Japanese). Retrieved October 22, 2007.</ref>

The natural geography of the area, particularly of Wada Cape in [[Hyōgo-ku, Kobe|Hyōgo-ku]], led to the development of a port, which would remain the economic center of the city.<ref name="hyogotsu">[http://www.hyogo-tourism.jp/english/hyogotsu/index.html Hyogo International Tourism Guide] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130123308/http://www.hyogo-tourism.jp/english/hyogotsu/index.html |date=November 30, 2006 }} – "Hyogo-tsu".

===Nara and Heian periods===
During the [[Nara period|Nara]] and [[Heian period]]s, the port was known by the name {{nihongo|Ōwada Anchorage||Ōwada-no-tomari}} and was one of the ports from which [[imperial embassies to China]] were dispatched.<ref name="kobecityinfo"/><ref name="oldkobehistory"/> 
The city was briefly the [[capital of Japan]] in 1180, when [[Taira no Kiyomori]] moved his grandson [[Emperor Antoku]] to [[Fukuhara-kyō]] in present-day Hyōgo-ku.<ref name="oldkobehistory" /> The Emperor returned to Kyoto after about five months.<ref name="kobecityinfo"/>
Shortly thereafter in 1184, the [[Taira]] fortress in Hyōgo-ku and the nearby Ikuta Shrine became the sites of the [[Genpei War]] [[battle of Ichi-no-Tani]] between the Taira and [[Minamoto clan]]s. The Minamoto prevailed, pushing the Taira further.

===Kamakura period===
As the port grew during the [[Kamakura period]], it became an important hub for trade with China and other countries. In the 13th century, the city came to be known by the name {{nihongo|Hyōgo Port|兵庫津|Hyōgo-tsu}}.<ref name="hyogotsu" /> During this time, Hyōgo Port, along with northern Osaka, composed the province of [[Settsu Province|Settsu]] (most of today's Kobe belonged to Settsu except [[Nishi-ku, Kobe|Nishi Ward]] and [[Tarumi-ku, Kobe|Tarumi Ward]], which belonged to [[Harima Province|Harima]]).

===Meiji period===
Hyōgo Port was opened to foreign trade by the Shogunal government at the same time as Osaka on January&nbsp;1, 1868, just before the advent of the [[Boshin War]] and the [[Meiji Restoration]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=John Whitney Hall|author2=Marius B.

Shortly after the opening of Kobe to trade, the [[Kobe Incident]] occurred, where several western soldiers sustained wounds from gunfire by troops from Bizen. The region has since been identified with the West and many foreign residences from the period remain in Kobe's [[Kitano-chō|Kitano area]].

=== Modern era ===
Kobe, as it is known today, was founded on April&nbsp;1, 1889, and was [[City designated by government ordinance|designated]] on September&nbsp;1, 1956 by government ordinance. The history of the city is closely tied to that of the Ikuta Shrine, and the name "Kobe" derives from {{nihongo||神戸|kamube|later ''kanbe''}}, an archaic name for those who supported the shrine.<ref name="nagasakiu"/><ref name="kojien_kanbe"/>

During [[World War II]], Kobe was lightly bombed in the [[Doolittle Raid]] on April 18, 1942, along with [[Tokyo]] and a few other cities. Eventually, it was [[Bombing of Kobe in World War II|bombed again with incendiary bombs by B-29 Superfortress bombers on March&nbsp;16 and 17,&nbsp;1945]], causing the death of 8,841 residents and the destruction of 21% of [[Bombing of Kobe in World War II|Kobe's urban area]]. This incident inspired the well-known [[Studio Ghibli]] film ''[[Grave of the Fireflies]]'' and the [[Grave of the Fireflies (novel)|book]] by [[Akiyuki Nosaka]] on which the film was based. It also features in the motion picture ''[[A Boy Called H]]''.

Following continuous pressure from citizens, on March&nbsp;18, 1975, the Kobe City Council passed an ordinance banning vessels carrying [[nuclear weapon]]s from Kobe Port. This effectively prevented any U.S. warships from entering the port, because U.S. policy is to never disclose whether any given warship is carrying nuclear weapons. This [[nuclear proliferation|nonproliferation]] policy has been termed the "[[Japan's non-nuclear policy#The Kobe Formula|Kobe formula]]".<ref>[http://www.prop1.org/prop1/jkobef.htm Kobe City Council] – "Resolution on the Rejection of the Visit of Nuclear-Armed Warships into Kobe Port", March 18, 1975.

On January 17, 1995, [[Great Hanshin earthquake|a magnitude 6.9 earthquake]] occurred at 5:46 am [[Japan Standard Time|JST]] near the city. About 6,434 people in the city were killed, 212,443 were made homeless, and large parts of the port facilities and other parts of the city were destroyed.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080625151141/http://www.city.kobe.jp/cityoffice/06/013/report/january.2008.pdf The Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake Statistics and Restoration Progress] (Jan. 2008).

Retrieved April 14, 2008.</ref> The earthquake destroyed portions of the [[Hanshin Expressway]], an elevated freeway that dramatically toppled over. In Japan, this earthquake is known as the [[Great Hanshin earthquake]] (or the Hanshin-Awaji earthquake). To commemorate Kobe's recovery from it, the city holds an event every December called the [[Kobe Luminarie|Luminarie]], where the city center is decorated with illuminated metal archways.

The [[Port of Kobe]] was Japan's busiest port and one of Asia's top ports until the Great Hanshin earthquake.<ref name="maruhon">[https://web.archive.org/web/20010303054315/http://maruhon.com/business/port.htm Maruhon Business News] – Port Conditions in Japan.

== Geography ==
[[File:151229_Kobe_Port_Japan01bs.jpg|thumb|260px|View of Kobe from an airplane]]

Wedged between the coast and the mountains, the city of Kobe is long and narrow. To the east is the city of [[Ashiya, Hyōgo|Ashiya]], while the city of [[Akashi, Hyōgo|Akashi]] lies to its west. Other adjacent cities include [[Takarazuka, Hyōgo|Takarazuka]] and [[Nishinomiya]] to the east and [[Sanda, Hyōgo|Sanda]] and [[Miki, Hyōgo|Miki]] to the north.

The landmark of the port area is the red steel [[Kobe Port Tower|Port Tower]]. A [[ferris wheel]] sits in nearby [[Harborland]], a notable tourist [[Esplanade|promenade]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Two artificial islands, [[Port Island]] and [[Rokkō Island]], have been constructed to give the city room to expand.

Away from the seaside at the heart of Kobe lie the [[Motomachi, Kobe|Motomachi]] and [[Sannomiya]] districts, as well as Kobe's [[Chinatown]], [[Nankin-machi]], all well-known retail areas. A multitude of train lines cross the city from east to west. The main transport hub is [[Sannomiya Station]], with the eponymous [[Kobe Station (Hyōgo)|Kobe Station]] located to the west and the [[Shinkansen]] [[Shin-Kobe Station]] to the north.

[[Mount Rokkō]] overlooks Kobe at an elevation of {{cvt|931|m}}. During autumn, it is famous for the rich change in [[autumn leaf color|colors of its forests]].

=== Wards ===
Kobe has nine [[wards of Japan|wards]] (''ku''):

# [[Nishi-ku, Kobe|Nishi-ku]]: The westernmost area of Kobe, Nishi-ku overlooks the city of [[Akashi, Hyōgo|Akashi]] and is the site of [[Kobe Gakuin University]]. This ward has the largest population, with 247,000 residents.<ref>[http://www.city.kobe.jp/cityoffice/06/013/toukei/contents/kubetusihyo.html City of Kobe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014182029/http://www.city.kobe.jp/cityoffice/06/013/toukei/contents/kubetusihyo.html |date=October 14, 2007 }}, "Population by Ward" (Japanese). Retrieved July 25, 2007.</ref>
# [[Kita-ku, Kobe|Kita-ku]]: Kita-ku is the largest ward by area and contains the Rokko Mountain Range, including [[Mount Rokkō]] and [[Mount Maya]]. The area is well known for its rugged landscape and hiking trails. The [[onsen]] resort town of [[Arima Onsen|Arima]] also lies within Kita-ku.
# [[Tarumi-ku, Kobe|Tarumi-ku]]: Tarumi-ku is a mostly residential area. The second-longest suspension bridge in the world, the [[Akashi Kaikyō Bridge]], extends from Maiko in Tarumi-ku to [[Awaji Island]] to the south. A relatively new addition to Kobe, Tarumi-ku was not a part of the city until 1946.
# [[Suma-ku, Kobe|Suma-ku]]: Suma-ku is the site of Suma beach, attracting visitors during the summer months.
# [[Nagata-ku, Kobe|Nagata-ku]]: Nagata-ku is the site of [[Nagata jinja|Nagata Shrine]], one of the three "Great Shrines" in Kobe.
# [[Hyōgo-ku, Kobe|Hyōgo-ku]]: At various times known as Ōwada Anchorage or Hyōgo Port, this area is the historical heart of the city. [[Shinkaichi]] in Hyogo-ku was once the commercial center of Kobe, but was heavily damaged during [[World War II]], and since, Hyogo-ku has lost much of its former prominence.
# [[Chūō-ku, Kobe|Chūō-ku]]: {{nihongo|''Chūō''|中央}} literally means "central" and, as such, Chūō-ku is the commercial and entertainment center of Kobe. [[Sannomiya]], [[Motomachi, Kobe|Motomachi]] and [[Harborland]] make up the main entertainment areas in Kobe. Chūō-ku includes the city hall and [[Hyōgo Prefecture|Hyōgo prefectural]] government offices. [[Port Island]] and [[Kobe Airport]] lie in the southern part of this ward.
# [[Nada-ku, Kobe|Nada-ku]]: The site of [[Oji Zoo]] and [[Kobe University]], Nada is known for [[Nada-Gogō|its sake]]. Along with [[Fushimi-ku, Kyoto|Fushimi]] in [[Kyoto]], it accounts for 45% of Japan's sake production.<ref>[http://www.kippo.or.jp/culture_e/syoku/sakejijo/sakejijo1.html Kansai Window] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619122900/http://www.kippo.or.jp/culture_e/syoku/sakejijo/sakejijo1.html |date=June 19, 2006 }}, "Japan's number one sake production". Retrieved February 6, 2007.</ref>
# [[Higashinada-ku, Kobe|Higashinada-ku]]: The easternmost area of Kobe, Higashinada-ku borders the city of [[Ashiya, Hyōgo|Ashiya]]. The man-made island of [[Rokko Island|Rokko]] makes up the southern part of this ward.
