'''Reus''' ({{IPA|ca|ˈrɛws}}) is the capital of [[Baix Camp]], in [[Camp de Tarragona]], [[Catalonia]], Spain. The area has always been an important producer of wines and spirits, and gained continental importance at the time of the [[Phylloxera]] plague. Currently it is known for its commercial activity, for being a centre for [[rock-climbing]] and as the birthplace of architect [[Antoni Gaudí]].

==Name==

The origin of the name is a source of discussion. One of the theories is that Reus comes from the [[Latin]] word used to describe convict prisoners (''reus''), and as such, it would be a Roman penitentiary. Currently, the most accepted theory is that the name has [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] roots, from the root ''red'' that originated the name ''redis'' (or ''reddis''), that would approximately mean ''place in the way'' / ''place in the roads'', or said alternatively, an inhabited place in a cross-road.

==History==

=== Foundation and early history ===

Around 1150 [[Robert d'Aguiló]] repopulated the region of Reus, after receiving it on 3 June 1154. On 5 June 1154 the [[archbishop of Tarragona]] gave two-thirds of Reus to [[Bertran de Castellet]], as a [[castellan]], with the order to build a church. On 29 June 1159, the distribution of income from ecclesiastical goods, the third of its Reus parish of Santa Maria was awarded to the camerlengo, starting the duplicity of governing the town. The camerlengo has the third of Reus parish. At this time the city was known as Redis or '''Reddis'''. The castellan [[Bernat de Bell-lloc]] gave the title of town to Reus on 3 August 1183, giving the ownership of houses and gardens, establishing a [[census]] to pay for farmland and reserving justice, but recognizing its [[vassalage]] towards the archbishopric of Tarragona. On 2 June 1186 the camerlengo [[Joan de Santboi]] confirmed the rights given by the castellan Bernard de Bell-lloc.

===Camerlengo, Popes and Archbishops of Tarragona===
In 1305 Reus revolted against the Archbishop [[Rodrigo Tello]], who wanted the citizens of Reus to pay for rebuilding the walls of [[Tarragona]]. In 1309 the king of Aragon gave Reus the right to hold a market on Mondays. The dynasty of Bell-lloc castellans became extinct in 1327 and then [[Bernard de Cabrera]] became the new castellan, but in 1335 the castellan was sold to [[Pere Mulet]], who lost it on 1345. Pere Mulet heirs sold their rights to [[Bernat d'Olzinelles]] in 1349. The camerlengo [[Pere Roger de Belfort]] disputed domain to the Archbishop [[López de Ayerbe]], who sent an army that decimated the town. A second attack was repulsed. A third attack was led by military occupation of the town and Reus was sacked. The camerlengo Pere Roger de Belfort, nephew of Pope [[Clement VI]], who was living in [[Avignon]] with his uncle, persuaded the Pope to call the [[archbishop of Tarragona]] and the [[Pope]] received a commitment for peace.
Pere Roger de Belfort gave the roses off his coat to coat of arms of the town and he later became Pope [[Gregory XI]], he retained the title as a camerlengo of Reus, so the coat of arms was crowned and adorned with, a papal tiara and the keys of St. Peter.
[[File:Rosa5.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Coat of arms, 1567]]

===Catalan Revolt war and the Archduke Charles===
At the beginning of the [[Reapers' War|Catalan Revolt war]] the town had 1200 houses, but reduced to 800 by the end of the war. On 16 December 1640 was declared an enemy of the fatherland by the Parliament and confiscated the goods of the inhabitants, as a response to the inactive participation in the war. In 1641 it was occupied by the French general [[Philippe de La Mothe-Houdancourt|La Mothe]].

Reus was loyal to [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] until 1705, but this year, under the direction of [[Joan Nebot]], revolted in favor of the [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles]]. On 3 July 1706 the [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles]] came to the town. In 1707 fell shortly to the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], but in 1709 Reus surrendered to the [[House of Bourbon|Spanish and French Bourbons]]. In 1710 Reus returned again to the field of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles]]. On 5 June 1712 the wife of the Archduke, [[Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Elisabeth Christine]], gave the title of [[imperial city]] to Reus. In 1713 Reus was occupied finally by the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]].

===Growth in the eighteenth century===
In the eighteenth century Reus had phenomenal growth and became the second city of the [[principality of Catalonia]]. The walls were completely demolished in 1766. The town developed the textile trade and the [[liquor]] trade. In this last contribution was the first center, the others were [[London]] and [[Paris]]. From this time it's the popular sentence "Reus, Paris and London”, because Reus was one of the centers of the liquor marquet. The construction of a canal between Reus and Salou, proposed by [[Pere Sunyer]] was granted in 1805, but it was stopped because of the [[Peninsular War|French War]]. At this time Reus had consulates in the United States, [[Liguria]], England, [[Holland]], [[Sweden]], [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]], [[Denmark]], [[Sicily]], the [[Papal States]], France, [[Portugal]], [[Naples]] and [[Prussia]].

=== 19th and 20th centuries ===
[[File:FrancoenReus.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Francisco Franco]] in Reus, 1940]]
In 1854 the [[Reus Gas Company]] was founded. In 1856 the railway between Reus and Tarragona was built. In 1884 the [[Catalan Association of Reus]] was founded and in 1893 was celebrated the Assembly of the [[Unió Catalana]]. In 1886 [[Pau Font de Rubinat]] founded the Catalan newspaper ''[[Lo Somatent]]''. In 1895 the [[phylloxera]] killed big areas of [[vineyards]] in the region of Reus and many of this areas were changed to [[hazelnuts]].

In 1931 Reus voted for the [[Second Spanish Republic|republic]]. In 1936 [[Francisco Franco]] bombed the city until his rebel army occupied the city on 15 January 1939, starting with the dictatorship of Franco until his death in 1975.

The first democratic mayor after Franco was [[Carles Martí Massagué]], lawyer of Reus. In 1983 [[Anton Borrell Marcó]] was the new mayor of the city, but he died in a car accident on the road from Reus to Cambrils, then his successor was [[Juan Maria Roig]]. After him, [[Josep Abelló Padró]] was the mayor until 1999, replaced by [[Lluís Miquel Pérez Segura]], who occupied the position until 2011, when the current mayor, [[Carles Pellicer i Punyed]], started.

==Demography==
Reus was for long the second city of [[Catalonia]] with a population of 14,440 in 1787 and 27,257 in 1860. It was overtaken by [[Tarragona]] and [[Lleida]] between 1900 and 1930. The population barely grew between 1920 and 1930, with 30,266 and 35,950 inhabitants, respectively. From then, the population growth has been substantial, from 41,014 inhabitants in 1960 to 108,100 inhabitants that the city has as of the end of 2008. [[Immigration]], mostly from [[Marrakesh]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/03/01/387481590/spains-muslim-business-owners-feel-squeezed-by-new-zoning-proposals|title=Spain's Muslim Business Owners Feel Squeezed By New Zoning Proposals|last=Benzawi|first=Nouari|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-01-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/catalonia-deportation-case-brings-identity-politics-in-spain-to-new-low|title=Catalonia Deportation Case Brings 'Identity Politics' in Spain to New Low - Our World|website=ourworld.unu.edu|access-date=2019-01-18}}</ref> has been a portion of that increase. About 6% are Muslim and 8% from other religions.

According to the 2006 official Spanish [[census]] (source: Instituto Nacional de Estadística), Reus is the 9th most populous city in Catalonia and the 59th in Spain.

==Festivities==
[[Image:Nanos de Reus 02.jpg|right|thumb|The "Nanos" of Reus.]]
The principal Reus festivity is ''Sant Pere'' on 29 June, declared of National Touristic Interest. One of the most characteristic and popular acts of these festivities is the so-called ''tronada'', which is a series of 29 little mortars ''masclets'' with bangers interleaved, arranged linearly around the ''Mercadal'' square (where the city hall is located), united by a hand craft gunpowder line. This line ends in a square shape in front of the city hall, with more bangers and 9 more ''masclets''. Also, on September 25, the ''Mare de Déu de la Misericòrdia'' is held.

Other noteworthy festivities are the [[Carnival]] and the ''Anada a l'Antiga'' towards [[Salou]]. Most of the neighborhoods have their own festivities.

Besides the major festivities, Reus holds many festivals, for example ''Cos'', a festival dedicated to mime, or ''El Trapezi'', a festival with circus spectacles. In every odd numbered year the Reus Institut Municipal d’Accio Cultural presents the ''Biennals Internacionals de Fotografia Medalla Gaudi''. This bi-annual exhibition features fine art photographers from around the world working in Alternative Photographic Processes (such as Platinum Printing, Gum Dichromate, Etc.). At each Biennal they award the Medalla Gaudi award to a select few artists and purchase their work for the Institut Municipal d’Accio Cultural's permanent collection.

==Tourism==
[[File:Reus - Ajuntament - 01.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The market square.]]
In recent years,{{when|date=April 2023}} tourism in Reus has expanded as more and more people come to the [[Costa Daurada]] region for their summer holidays or some winter sun. Nowadays, the largest group of tourists comes from Russia, followed by France and Holland.<ref>Tourism in Reus|http://www.reusdigital.cat/index.php?command=show_news&news_id=14564</ref>

Reus is close to the resort town of [[Salou, Spain|Salou]] and one of Europe's biggest theme resort at [[PortAventura World]]. Tour companies and buses operate services to Reus from tourist destinations in the region such as [[Salou]], La Pineda and [[Cambrils]].

The accommodation in Reus consists of small hotels, hostels, and major chained hotels owned by [[NH Hoteles]] and Hotusa Group.

Recently, {{when|date=April 2023}} [[Reus Airport]] has started to receive low cost flights from [[Ryanair]] that fly to Reus from many different European locations and North Africa. The airport also receives major charter flights from the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Barcelona Airport]] is another airport which serves the area for those destinations not served by [[Reus Airport]].

==Transport==
The city is served by [[Reus Airport]].

==Flag of Reus==
The first [[flag]] of Reus was in use from 1774 to 1943. The flag was dark red with the city arms in the centre.

In 1943 the flag was changed because the color red seemed to be associated with the left, defeated in the civil war (1936–39). As the historic city arms were argent with a heraldic rose the new flag was white with a heraldic rose in the center. Minor changes to the rose in the flag were made after 1943.

Currently the rose has a new version, taken from the city emblem. The emblem itself has official status. This presumably also applies to the flag, but this has not been confirmed by the local government.
