=== Pre-Roman ===

Human occupation of the region of Braga dates back thousands of years, documented by vestiges of monumental structures starting in the [[Megalithic]] era. During the [[Iron Age]], the [[Castro culture]] extended into the northwest, characterized by [[Bracari]] peoples who occupied the high ground in strategically located fortified settlements ([[Castro (village)|castrum]]).

The region became the domain of the ''Callaici Bracarii'', a [[Celts|Celtic]]<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YFR2AgAAQBAJ&q=origem+celta+braga+bracara&pg=PA45|title=Introdução à História da Língua e Cultura Portuguesas|first=José Barbosa|last=Machado|date=1 January 2014|publisher=Edições Vercial|isbn=9789897001857|access-date=27 March 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> tribe who occupied what is now northern Portugal, [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and Asturias in the northwest of [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]].

=== Roman rule ===
The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] began their conquest of the region around 136 BC, and finished it, by conquering the northern regions, during the reign of [[Emperor Augustus]]. The civitas of '''Bracara Augusta''' was founded in 16 BC; in the context of the administrative reorganization of these Roman acquisitions, Bracara was rededicated to the Emperor taking on the name ''Bracara Augusta''. The city of Bracara Augusta developed greatly during the 1st century and reached its maximum extension around the 2nd century.

Towards the end of the 3rd century, the [[Diocletianus|Emperor Diocletian]] promoted the city to the status of capital of the administrative area [[Conventus bracarensis]], the southwestern area of the newly founded Roman province of Gallaecia.

===Braga in Late Antiquity and Middle Ages===
[[File:Iberia 500.svg|left|355x355px|frameless]]
The city was described as prosperous by the poet [[Ausonius]], in the 4th century.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Marques |first=António Henrique R. de Oliveira |title=História de Portugal : manual para uso de estudantes e outros curiosos de assuntos do passado pátrio |date=1997 |publisher=Presença <!--|year=1993--> |isbn=972-23-2189-7 |edition=13th |location=Lisboa |pages=43–44 |oclc=476465662}}</ref> Between 402 and 470 the [[Migration Period|Germanic Invasions of the Iberian Peninsula]] occurred, and the area was conquered by the [[Suebi]], a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] people from Central Europe. According to records the city was protected by a wall, still in use since the 3rd century, and the old [[Roman amphitheatre]] was repurposed into a fortress.<ref name=":0"/> In 410, the Suebi established a Kingdom in northwest Iberia covering what is present-day's Northern half of Portugal,<ref>[[E. A. Thompson|Thompson, E. A.]] ''Romans and Barbarians: The Decline of the Western Empire''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1982. {{ISBN|0-299-08700-X}} pp. 153–154.</ref> Galicia and Asturias, which they maintained as ''[[Kingdom of Galicia|Gallaecia]]'', and had Bracara as their capital. This kingdom was founded by [[Hermeric]] and lasted for over 150 years. However, the departure of the [[Vandals]] and the arrival of the [[Visigoths]] brought a new instability to the region. Between 419 and 422, Braga was threatened by the Vandals so it prepared itself for a siege, closed its gates and refused to open them; this led to the destruction of the surrounding countryside.<ref name=":0"/> Nevertheless, between 429 and 455, the Suebi made a military comeback in Iberia reinforcing their hold in Galeicia and [[Lusitania]].<ref name=":0"/> In 455, while the Visigothic king [[Theodoric II]] sacked Braga, utterly destroying many historical and archaeological records,<ref name=":0" /> the Suebi king [[Rechiar]] escaped the city, wounded, to [[Porto]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Díaz Martínez |first=Pablo de la Cruz |title=El reino suevo (411-585) |date=2011 |isbn=978-84-460-3648-7 |location=Tres Cantos, Madrid, España |oclc=958059531}}</ref> However, records of a list of dioceses and parishes of Braga, made in 570 still exist.<ref name=":0"/> By about 584, the Visigoths took permanent control of Gallaecia from the Suebi, and Braga was made a provincial capital.

Because historians are still unsure of the dating of the [[Chapel of São Pedro de Balsemão]], in [[Lamego]], currently Braga hosts the oldest [[chapel]] in Portugal, the [[Chapel of São Frutuoso]]. The chapel was built by the Visigoths on top of a Roman temple to [[Asclepius]] and it was made to be a Royal Chapel. In 656 AD, it was consecrated by [[Fructuosus of Braga|Saint Fructuosus]]<ref name=":0" /> to be used as his tomb.

[[File:Rua Júlio Lima.JPG|235px|thumb|A view of ''Rua Júlio Lima'' at the beginning of the 20th century]]

Historical records show, so far, that the first known [[:pt:Lista de bispos e arcebispos de Braga|bishop of Braga]] was named ''Paternus'',<ref name=":0" /> who famously renounced [[priscillianism]] at the [[First Council of Toledo]], in September of 400 AD. We also have records of a bishop named ''Balconius'' (415-447), who was also recorded to be present when the Iberian clergy received, in 435, a German priest from [[Arabia Petraea|Arabia]] accompanied by several Greeks with news from the [[Council of Ephesus]] (431).<ref name=":0"/> ''Balconius'' was also a contemporary and correspondent of [[Pope Leo I]].<ref name=":0"/>

Tradition, however, states that [[Peter of Rates|Saint Peter of Rates]] was the first bishop of Braga, a Jew personally elevated to the role by [[James the Great|Saint James]]. Another bishop, [[Saint Ovidius]] (d. 135 AD) is also sometimes considered one of the first bishops of this city.

Braga had an important role in the ''[[Christianization]]'' of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. In the early 5th century, [[Paulus Orosius]] (a friend of [[Augustine of Hippo]]) wrote several [[Theology|theological]] works that expounded the Christian faith. While thanks to the work of [[Martin of Braga|Saint Martin of Braga]] the Suebi in Iberia renounced the [[Arianism|Arian]] and [[Priscillianist]] heresies during two synods held here in the 6th century.<ref name=":0" /> It is also worth noting that Rechiar, the suebi king, was also the first Germanic king in Europe to convert to [[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian Christianism]], predating [[Clovis I|Clovis]] of the [[Franks]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Visigothic Spain : new approaches |date=1980 |publisher=Clarendon Press |others=Edward James |isbn=0-19-822543-1 |location=Oxford |oclc=5100979}}</ref> At the time, Martin also founded an important [[Monastery of Dumio|monastery]] in [[Dumio]] (''Dume''), and it was in Braga that the [[Archbishopric of Braga]] held their councils. There were also some attempts at further elevating the religious status of the city, such as Paulus Orosius and [[Avitus of Braga]]'s attempt at bringing relics of [[Saint Stephen]], from the [[Holy Land]] to Braga. Originally, Avitus entrusted the delivery of the relics to Paulus Orosius. However, after arriving at [[Mallorca|Majorca]], the theologian heard news of the invasion of the peninsula by the [[Vandals]] and halted his pilgrimage to return to [[North Africa]]. The relics never reached their destination and their fates are unknown.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A dictionary of early Christian biography: and literature to the end of the sixth century A.D. ; with an account of the principal sects and heresies |date=2014 |publisher=Hendrickson Publ |isbn=978-1-61970-269-1 |editor-last=Wace |editor-first=Henry |location=Peabody, Mass. |pages=1263–1264 |editor-last2=Piercy |editor-first2=William Coleman}}</ref>

As a consequence, the Archbishops of Braga later claimed the title of ''Primatus Totus Hispania'', claiming supremacy over the entire Hispanic church. Yet, their authority was never accepted throughout [[Hispania]], and today they only retain the title of Primate of Portugal. The bishop ''Balconius'', who was later elevated to become the first [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Braga|Archbishop of Braga]], and according to later sources, was also the first to be given said title.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Aranha |first=Boaventura Maciel |url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-NwzgDXrRmIC&rdid=book--NwzgDXrRmIC&rdot=1 |title=Cuidados da morte e descuidos da vida...

The transition from Visigothic reigns to the [[Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula|Muslim conquest of Iberia]] was very obscure, representing a period of decline for the city. The Moors briefly captured Braga in 714–716, but were repelled by Christian forces under [[Alfonso I of Asturias]] in 741,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Menéndez Pidal |first1=Ramón |title=PRIMERA CRÓNICA GENERAL.

The [[bishopric]] was restored in 1070 and elevated to new heights. The first new [[Archbishop]], Peter of Braga (?-1096), immediately started rebuilding the [[Braga Cathedral|Cathedral]] (which was modified many times during the following centuries). According to historical records and oral tradition, the Archbishop [[Diego Gelmírez]] of [[Santiago de Compostela]], fearing the rise of the Cathedral of Braga, stole the [[relic]]s of Braga's saints in an attempt to diminish the religious importance of the city.<ref name=":1"/> The relics only [[Translation (relic)|returned]] to Braga in the 1990s.

When, after his death, [[Alfonso III the Great]] of the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] divided his kingdom among his sons in 908, he assigned the [[Kingdom of Galicia]] to [[Ordoño II of Galicia|Ordoño of Galicia]], who established his capital in Braga.<ref>{{Cite book |last=de Braga |first=Bernardo |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sn9XAAAAcAAJ&dq=braga+ordonho+I&pg=PA25 |title=Tratado sobre a precedencia do Reino de Portugal ao Reino de Napoles |publisher=Typogr. da revista |year=1843 |editor-last=da Silveira Pinto Albano |editor-first=Antero |pages=25}}</ref> Between 1093 and 1147, Braga became the residential seat of the Portuguese court. In the early 12th century, [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Count Henry of Portugal]] and bishop [[Gerald of Braga|Geraldo de Moissac]] reclaimed the archbishopric seat for Braga, with power over a large area in Iberia. The medieval city developed around the cathedral, with the maximum authority in the city retained by the archbishop.

===Braga in the Kingdom of Portugal===
Braga as the main center of Christianity in Iberia, during the [[Reconquista]] (until the emergence of Santiago de Compostela and, later, the conquest of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] from the Muslims, in 1085), held a prominent stage in medieval politics, being a major contributor to the Independence of Portugal with the intervention of the [[Paio Mendes|Archbishop D. Paio Mendes]] in the Vatican, with [[Pope Alexander III]], which lead to the promulgation of the [[Manifestis Probatum|Bula Manifestis Probatum]], in 1179, recognizing Portugal as an independent Kingdom under [[Afonso I of Portugal|D. Afonso I Henriques]]. It is traditionally told that the future king was baptized by [[Gerald of Braga|Saint Gerald of Braga]], although the exact location is still being debated.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cunha |first=D. Rodrigo da |url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Rodrigo_da_Cunha_Primeira_segunda_parte_da_histori?id=tEu_dU66MQkC |title=Primeira [-segunda] parte, da historia ecclesiastica dos arcebispos de Braga, e dos Santos, e Varoes illustres, que florecerão neste arcebispado. Por dom Rodrigo da Cunha arcebispo, & senhor de Braga, primàz das Hespanhas |year=1634 |volume=II |pages=2–29 |language=pt|author-link=Rodrigo da Cunha}}</ref> Because of this support for D. Afonso Henriques, the new king gave large privileges to the city of Braga handing it over to direct control of the Church, basically making it a personal fiefdom of the Archbishop. This legal particularism continued all throughout history until the [[5 October 1910 revolution|instauration]] of the [[First Portuguese Republic|Republic]] giving the city and its surrounding area the nickname of "''Paiz Bracarense''" (roughly translated as "Country of Braga").<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bandeira |first=Miguel |date=1993 |title=O espaço urbano de Braga em meados do séc. XVIII |url=https://ojs.letras.up.pt/index.php/geografia/article/view/7787 |journal=Revista da Faculdade de Letras - Geografia |volume=IX |pages=171–173}}</ref>

In the 16th century, due to its distance from the coast and provincial status, Braga did not profit from the adventures associated with the [[Age of Discovery|Age of Portuguese Discoveries]] (which favoured cities like [[Lisbon]], [[Évora]] and [[Coimbra]], new seats for the Portuguese court). Yet, Archbishop Diogo de Sousa, who sponsored several urban improvements in the city, including the enlargement of streets, the creation of public squares and the foundation of hospitals and new churches, managed to modernize the community. He expanded and remodelled the cathedral by adding a new chapel in the [[Manueline|Manueline style]], and generally turning the mediaeval town into a [[Renaissance]] city.

A similar period of rejuvenation occurred during the 18th century, when the archbishops of the [[House of Braganza]] contracted architects like [[André Soares (architect)|André Soares]] and [[Carlos Amarante]], to modernize and rejuvenate the city; they began a series of architectural transformations to churches and civic institutions in the [[Baroque|Baroque style]], including the municipal hall, public library, the [[Bom Jesus do Monte|Sanctuary of Bom Jesus do Monte]] and many urban palaces. [[D. Luís de Sousa]] was another main archbishop who, with other merits, ordered the Church of the Parish of Saint Victor to be rebuilt, ordered the [[Avenida Central|Campo de S. Ana]] to be enlarged, to rebuild the Church of S. Vicente, to requalify the Chapel of S. Sebastian and the construction of the Igreja dos Congregados which would later be monumentalized into the current version of the [[Congregados Basilica|Basilica of the Congregados]]. Likewise, under the auspices of this diplomatic archbishop, the [[Canon regular|canon]] of the Braga Chapter, João Meira Carrilho, ordered the construction of the Chapel of the [[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri|Congregation of the Oratory]] that existed within the Campo de S. Ana (modern day ''Avenida Central'').<ref>{{Cite book |last=Portocarrero |first=Gustavo |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/733958410 |title=Braga na Idade Moderna : paisagem e identidade |date=2010 |publisher=CEIPHAR |isbn=978-972-95143-2-6 |location=Tomar |pages=81–100 |oclc=733958410}}</ref> The old fortress built on top of the Roman amphitheatre still stood in the 18th century (a description of it was made during the reign of [[Maria I of Portugal|Queen D. Maria I]]), in the southern part of [[Maximinos]].<ref name=":0" />

In 1758, Braga, like many other places, was included in the census requested by the monarchy, under the [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal|1st Marquis of Pombal]]. These records are known as the [[Parochial Memories of 1758|Parochial Memories]] (''Memórias Paroquiais'') which can be consulted through various sources.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Capela |first=José Viriato |url=http://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/ |title=As freguesias do distrito de Braga nas Memórias Paroquiais de 1758: a construção do imaginário minhoto setecentista |date=2003}}</ref>

In March 1809 it was the scene of the [[Battle of Braga (1809)|Battle of Braga]], when French troops under [[Marshal Soult]] took the town from its Portuguese garrison. With the invasion of French troops, during the [[Peninsular Wars]] the city was relegated, once again, to a provincial status. But, by the second half of that century, with influence from Portuguese immigrants living in Brazil, new money and tastes resulted in improvements to architecture and infrastructures.

===Braga in the Republic===
The [[Castle of Braga]], previously located in the city center, was destroyed in 1905 (to great popular fanfair), despite attempts to save it by several people such as archaeologist Albano Belino, who tried to change the location of his municipal museum to the building in an attempt to protect it. Belino, disgusted, suffered from a [[stroke]], passing away the following year and ending up donating his estate to the ''Archaeological Museum of the Martins Sarmento de Guimarães Society''. Albano Belino's dream of creating a museum in Braga was only realized in 1918, with the founding of a museum directly precursor to the [[Dom Diogo de Sousa Regional Museum of Archaeology]].

On May 28, 1926, [[General officer|General]] [[Manuel Gomes da Costa|Gomes da Costa]] began his march from Braga to [[Lisbon]] starting the [[28 May 1926 coup d'état|Revolution of May 28]], where he abolished the [[First Portuguese Republic|First Republic]] and implementing the dictatorial government which would eventually become the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]. In the tenth anniversary of the Revolution, dictator [[António de Oliveira Salazar]], visited the city prompting a large fair, a parade and a speech, which he gave on the balcony of the Town Hall. Afterwards, the dictator would return several times to the city in its anniversary, such as the 40º anniversary.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Salazar no 40.º Aniversário do 28 de Maio de 1926 |url=https://arquivos.rtp.pt/conteudos/salazar-no-40-o-aniversario-do-28-de-maio-de-1926/ |website=RTP}}</ref>

In the 20th century Braga faced similar periods of growth and decline; demographic and urban pressures, from urban-to-rural migration meant that the city's infrastructures had to be improved in order to satisfy greater demands.

Situated in the heart of Minho, Braga is located in a transitional region between the east and west: between mountains, forests, grand valleys, plains and fields, constructing natural spaces, moulded by human intervention. Geographically, with an area of {{convert|184|km2|mi2}} it is bordered in the north by the municipalities of [[Vila Verde]] and [[Amares]], northeast and east by [[Póvoa de Lanhoso]], south and southeast with [[Guimarães]] and [[Vila Nova de Famalicão]] and west by the municipality of [[Barcelos, Portugal|Barcelos]].<ref name="Diagnostic">{{citation |url=http://www.saudepublica.web.pt/TrabPedro/ACES-Brg_DS-2009-2.pdf |contribution=Caracterização do Concelho de Braga |title=Diagnóstico do Concelho de Braga |first=P.

The [[topography]] in the municipality is characterized by irregular valleys, interspersed by mountainous spaces, fed by rivers running in parallel with the principal rivers. In the north it is limited by the [[Cávado River]], in the south by terrain of the Serra dos Picos to a height of {{convert|566|m|ft}} and towards the east by the Serra dos Carvalhos to a height of {{convert|479|m|ft}}, opening to the municipalities of Vila Nova de Famalicão and Barcelos. The territory extends from the northeast to southwest, accompanying the valleys of the two rivers, fed by many of its tributaries, forming small platforms between {{convert|20|m|ft}} and {{convert|570|m|ft}}.

The municipality lies between {{convert|20|m|ft}} and {{convert|572|m|ft}}, with the urbanized centre located at approximately {{convert|215|m|ft}}. In the north, where the municipality is marked by the Cavado, the terrain is semi-planar, the east is mountainous owing to the Serra do Carvalho {{convert|479|m|ft}}, Serra dos Picos {{convert|566|m|ft}}, Monte do Sameiro {{convert|572|m|ft}} and Monte de Santa Marta {{convert|562|m|ft}}. Between the Serra do Carvalho and Serra dos Picos is the River Este, forming the valley of Vale d’Este. Similarly, between the Serra dos Picos and Monte do Sameiro, there exists the plateau of Sobreposta-Pedralva. To the south and west, the terrain is a mix of mountains, plateaus and medium-size valleys, permitting the passage of the River Este, and giving birth to other confluences including the River Veiga, River Labriosca and various ravines.

===Climate===
Braga has a [[warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] similar to other cities in the northwest Iberian Peninsula except for having significantly hotter summer temperatures due to being some distance from the ocean: the absolute maximum is as much as {{convert|5|C-change|0}} higher than neighbouring [[A Coruña]] or Santiago de Compostela. The highest and lowest recorded temperatures are {{convert|42.2|°C|1}} and {{convert|-7|°C|1}} respectively.
The climate is affected by the Atlantic Ocean which influences westerly winds that are channeled through the region's valleys, transporting large humid air masses. Consequently, the climate tends to be pleasant with clearly defined seasons. The air masses have the effect of maintaining morning relative humidity around 80%: annual mean temperatures hover between {{convert|12.5|C|F}} and {{convert|17.5|C|F}}. Owing to nocturnal cooling, frost usually forms frequently between three and four months of the year (about 29 days of frost annually)<ref>{{Cite web |title=Climate normals for Braga (1971-2000) |url=https://www.ipma.pt/bin/file.data/climate-normal/cn_71-00_BRAGA_POSTO_AGRARIO.pdf |access-date=2024-10-20 |website=[[Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera]]}}</ref> and annually the region receives {{convert|1449|mm|in}} of precipitation, with the major intensity occurring between fall/winter and spring.

The municipality is densely populated, with approximately 962 inhabitants per square kilometre, equivalent to 181,474 residents (2011); it is one of the more populous territories in Portugal, as well as one of the "younger" markets.<ref name="INE">{{Citation |url=http://www.ine.pt/|title=Census de 1991, 2001 e Território em números de 2004 |language=pt |publisher=INE – Instituto Nacional de Estatistica |location=Lisbon, Portugal |access-date=24 March 2012 |year=2004}}</ref> The majority of the population concentrates in the urban area of Braga, itself, where densities are more than 10000 per square kilometre.

The Bracarense population consists of approximately 78954 male and 85238 female individuals, with 35% of the population less than 25 years of age, while seniors conform to 11% of the population; the working population of the municipality occupies 54% of this structure.<ref name=INE/> Although largely native Portuguese, other segments of the population include [[Brazilians]], [[African diaspora|Africans]] (principally from the former Portuguese colonies), [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and eastern European peoples, namely [[Ukrainians]].<ref name=INE/>
[[File:Adaúfe (P1000332).JPG|thumb|200px|Beach in Cávado River, Braga]]
The urban structure includes approximately 70,268 residences (2001), even as the typical classic representation of family only includes 51,173 members in the municipality.<ref name=INE/> The "extra" homes are primarily temporary residences, normally for students, migrant workers and professionals working in the city. There is, also, a great number of homes owned by Portuguese residents living overseas (who use the homes periodically while in Portugal) even as constant and development has attracted new growth in the population.<ref name=INE/> Further, the difference in resident to transitory population means that, on average, the population of Braga hovers between 174,000 and 230,000 individuals annually.<ref name=INE/>

Growth in the population, roughly 16.2% between 1991 and 2001, occurred mainly in the older suburban civil parishes, such as Nogueira (now abolished) (124.6%), Frossos (now abolished) (68.4%), Real (now abolished) (59.8%) and Lamaçães (now abolished) (50.9%).<ref name=INE/><ref>{{Cite web |title=0000200147 |url=https://files.dre.pt/1s/2013/01/01901/0000200147.pdf |access-date=29 December 2022 |website=DRE |language=pt-PT}}</ref>

=== Civil parishes ===
Administratively, the municipality is divided into 37 civil parishes (''freguesias''):<ref>{{cite web|title=Law nr. 11-A/2013, pages 552 26–28|url=http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2013/01/01901/0000200147.pdf |access-date=18 July 2014|author=Diário da República|author-link=Diário da República|language=pt}}</ref>
