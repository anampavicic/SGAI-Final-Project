The capital city of the state is [[Ibadan]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Oguntola |first=Tunde |date=2022-09-27 |title=2023: Next President, Govs Must Get Two-thirds Spread, Says INEC |url=https://leadership.ng/2023-next-president-govs-must-get-two-thirds-spread-says-inec/ |access-date=2023-02-23 |language=en-US |archive-date=2023-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230223113538/https://leadership.ng/2023-next-president-govs-must-get-two-thirds-spread-says-inec/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Electoral system==
The governor of each state is selected using a modified two-round system. To be elected in the first round, a candidate must receive the plurality of the vote and over 25% of the vote in at least two -third of the State local government Areas. If no candidate passes threshold, a second round will be held between the top candidate and the next candidate to have received a plurality of votes in the highest number of local government Areas.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Ayadi |first1=Manel |last2=Amor |first2=Nahla Ben |title=2015 IEEE 27th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI) |chapter=Multi-round Vote Elicitation for Manipulation under Candidate Uncertainty |date=November 2015 |chapter-url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ictai.2015.113 |pages=760–767 |publisher=IEEE |doi=10.1109/ictai.2015.113|isbn=978-1-5090-0163-7 |s2cid=9778141 }}</ref>
