'''Oviedo''' ({{IPA|es|oˈβjeðo|lang}}) or '''Uviéu''' ([[Asturian language|Asturian]]: {{IPA-ast|uˈβjew|}}) is the capital city of the Principality of [[Asturias]] in northern [[Spain]] and the administrative and commercial centre of the region. It is also the name of the municipality that contains the city. Oviedo is located approximately {{convert|24|km|0|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Gijón]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://esdistancia.com/route/oviedo/gij%C3%B3n|title=Distancia de Oviedo a Gijón en coche|website=esdistancia.com|language=es|access-date=2018-12-18|archive-date=6 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806044802/https://esdistancia.com/route/oviedo/gij%C3%B3n|url-status=live}}</ref> and {{convert|23|km|0|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Avilés]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://esdistancia.com/route/oviedo/aviles|title=Distancia de Oviedo a Avilés en coche|website=esdistancia.com|language=es|access-date=2018-12-18|archive-date=6 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806041823/https://esdistancia.com/route/oviedo/aviles|url-status=live}}</ref> both of which lie on the shoreline of the [[Bay of Biscay]]. Oviedo's proximity to the ocean of less than {{convert|30|km|mi}} in combination with its elevated position with areas of the city more than 300 metres above sea level causes the city to have a [[maritime climate]], in spite of its not being located on the shoreline itself.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Oviedo}}
The [[Kingdom of Asturias]] began in 720, with the Visigothic aristocrat [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelagius]]'s (685–737) revolt against the Muslims who at the time were occupying most of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. The [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Moorish invasion]] that began in 711 had taken control of most of the peninsula, until the revolt in the northern mountains by Pelagius. The resulting Kingdom of Asturias, located in an economically poor region of Iberia, was largely ignored by the Muslims. In 720, the area where Oviedo is now located was still uninhabited.<ref>[[Linehan, Peter]]. ''History and the historians of medieval Spain''. Clarendon Press, 1993, p.83-4.</ref>

It is said that two monks, Máximo and Fromestano ({{Langx|la|Maximus et Fromestanus}}), founded the city in 761. That settlement was soon to be completed with the construction of a small church dedicated to [[Vincent of Saragossa|Saint Vincent]]. Oviedo was established on an uninhabited hillside, with no Visigothic or Roman foundation before it became an Asturian city.<ref>Linehan 1993, p.83-4</ref>  Following Pelagius, who died in 737, [[Alfonso I of Asturias|Alfonso I]] (739–57) founded a dynasty that reigned until 1037. The Asturian Kingdom was on hostile terms with southern Moorish Spain. In 794, Oviedo was sacked and pillaged by Caliph [[Hisham I of Córdoba|Hisham I]] in one of his numerous campaigns against the Christian kingdoms.<ref>''Hisham I'', D.M. Dunlop, ''[[The Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', Vol. III, ed. [[Bernard Lewis|B. Lewis]], V.L. Menage, [[Charles Pellat|C. Pellat]] and [[Jacob Schacht|J. Schacht]], (E.J. Brill, 1986), 495.</ref>

King Alfonso I is said to have "set in place the whole order of the Goths, as it had been in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], as much in the church as in the palace."<ref>''Chronica Albeldensia''. XV. 9: ed. Gil, Crónicas asturianas, p. 174.</ref>  The intention with Oviedo was to shape it into a city similar to that of Visigothic Toledo. Once kings had settled in Oviedo, they adopted as much of the architectural style and imagery of Toledo. Even with this in mind, Oviedo did not necessarily resemble the old Visigothic capital in Toledo. The churches and buildings of Oviedo follow instead late provincial Roman tradition. Since Asturias at the time was an agriculturally poor area of Spain the scale of the buildings is quite impressive.<ref>Wickham, Chris.''The Inheritance of Rome''. Penguin Books, 2009, p. 500-3</ref>

Oviedo's rich architectural tradition began with King Fruela I (757–768). King [[Fruela I of Asturias]], the fourth of the Asturian monarchs, was the first decided promoter of the city as may be witnessed by his construction of both a palace and a nearby church. This church was later restored by Alfonso II. Oviedo owes to a later king, [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II]] The Chaste (791–842), its establishment as a capital city and ruling seat as a result of the moving of the court from [[Pravia]] and the creation of the Pilgrim's Route to [[Santiago de Compostela]], a major event in the history of Oviedo, a church dedicated to [[Jesus Christ|The Saviour]], the [[Oviedo Cathedral|Cathedral of San Salvador]], and a royal palace formed the nucleus of Oviedo. Also constructed during Alfonso II's reign was the San Julian de los Prados church, which is one of the best preserved Asturian churches. Alfonso II's successor, [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro I]] (842–850), continued Alfonso II's construction streak. Ramiro I constructed two buildings, the [[Santa María del Naranco|Church Santa Maria del Naranco]] and [[San Miguel de Lillo]]. The Church Santa Maria de Naranco was likely to originally be Ramiro I's palace and later changed into a church.<ref>Collins, Roger. ''Caliphs and Kings: Spain, 796-1031''. Wiley-Blackwell, 2012, p.109</ref>  By this time the Court of the Palace was centered in Oviedo, which was the main royal residence. This court was controlled by members of the Asturian nobility.<ref name="Collins 2012, p.71">Collins 2012, p.71</ref>

Ramiro I's (842–850) eight-year tenure was uneasy, he faced rebellions from the Counts of the Palace. The first rebellion against Ramiro I was led by Alroitus, and the second rebellion was led by Piniolus. Both of these rebellions were unsuccessful in removing Ramiro I. These rebellions may have been why Ramiro I built his palace in the mountains surrounding Oviedo, presumably away from the violence.<ref name="Collins 2012, p.71"/>  During the 9th century in Oviedo, Roman style property law is common. 9th century documents also indicate small scale aristocracies across the kingdom, as well as a large presence of a landowning peasantry.<ref name="Wickham 2009, p.500-3">Wickham 2009, p.500-3</ref>

Following Ramiro I's reign, [[Ordoño I]] (850–866) came into power and began the Asturian king's father-son succession. Ordoño I was the first king to push southwards into Arab territory.<ref name="Wickham 2009, p.500-3"/>  Following Ordoño I's death on May 27, 866, usurpers attempted to take the throne. The following [[Alfonso III of Asturias|king Alfonso III]] (866–910), who was thirteen at the time, took refuge in Castile until his followers had killed the usurper.<ref name="Collins 2012, p.78">Collins 2012, p.78</ref>

Alfonso III's contributions to building construction are not nearly as well documented as Ramiro I's or Alfonso II's contributions. The Chronicle of Alfonso III does not mention any buildings created by Alfonso III, neither does the Chronicle of Albelda. In 882, the body of the Cordoban martyr [[Eulogius of Córdoba|Eulogius]] was sent to Oviedo. This was meant a diplomatic gift from Emir Muhammad I (852–886). Eulogius was executed in 859. The body was likely accompanied by Eulogius's book collection.<ref name="Collins 2012, p.78"/>  In the 16th century, the only manuscript of Eulogius's writings was discovered in the Oviedo Cathedral Library. Here it was copied once before it disappeared completely from the library. Following an offensive in 881 against an Umayyad army, Alfsonso III returned to Oviedo to rebuild churches. It was at this time he constructed one or more palaces. [[The Chronicle of Albelda]] and the [[Sampiro|Chronicle of Sampiro]] tie Alfonso III's victories in battle to his program of church building in Oviedo.<ref name="Collins 2012, p.81">Collins 2012, p.81</ref>  In 908, Alfonso III commissioned a gold and jewelled cross to contain the cross carried by Pelagius I at Covadonga. This "Cross of Victory" is located in the [[Cámara Santa|Camara Sancta]] in the Oviedo Cathedral. However, recent Carbon14 analysis of the wooden cross indicates that it was no older than the golden casing created to surround the cross. The commission of the casing shows us Alfonso III's interest in perpetuating the legend of Pelagius I.

Towards the end of Alfonso III's reign, he faced many challenges. In 901, a prophet named Alhaman led a "great army of Muslims" and attempted to take Zamora.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} To add to this, Alfonso III's brother Vermudo revolted in Astorga. There were several attempts at the aging Alfonso III's life by his sons. Alfonso III was overthrown by sons, and died in Zamora. His body was taken to Oviedo for burial.

The moving of the royal court to [[León, León|León]], after the death of [[Alfonso III of León|Alfonso III]], 'The Great', links the life of the city to the relics preserved in its cathedral and the passing of pilgrims that visit El Salvador, and continue on their way to Santiago de Compostela. Kings spent less and less time in Oviedo following the change, and spent more time in the rich Duero Plains. León was built up after it became the capital, and eventually surpassed Oviedo in terms of construction.

During the 12th century, many Royal Charters were fabricated by [[Pelagius of Oviedo|Bishop Pelayo]] de [[Bishopric of Oviedo|Oviedo]], "el fabulador" ("the fabulist"). Since there were few checks on internal bookkeeping in the kingdom actions like this had become commonplace throughout Asturias. When original documents faded, they were copied onto cartularies and often with alterations that suited the needs of those who copied the documents. The most glaring example can be seen in the ''[[Liber Testamentorum]]'', which was compiled by Bishop Pelayo de Oviedo in 1109. This document contained many confirmation rights and property rights of the Oviedo cathedral by Asturian and Leonese Kings. Bishop Pelayo's intent behind this was to try to gain the independence of his see from the archbishop of [[Archbishopric of Toledo|Toledo]] or Santiago, as well as to promote Oviedo as a pilgrim destination.<ref>Collins 2012, p.51</ref>  According to Sánchez-Albornoz, "He (Bishop Pelayo) always, always, always falsified."<ref>'Siempre, siempre, siempre falsificó al service de las Gloria de su iglesia’: Hist. de España Espasa calpe, vii. I. p.589</ref>  It is assumed that Bishop Pelayo never committed forgery for the enjoyment, but primarily to promote the church of Oviedo.<ref>Linehan 1993, p.78-9</ref>

The following centuries (12th–16th) witness the development of the medieval city, the outlines of which are still preserved today, the construction of the city walls, a devastating fire which took place on Christmas Eve in 1521, and the [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]] works, ''Los Pilares'', constructed in order to provide the city with water throughout the 16th century.

The foundation of the Arts College ([[University of Oviedo]]) by [[Fernando de Valdés Salas]], at the beginning of the 17th century, opened Oviedo to a progressive urban expansion. Further impulse was in the 18th century by the regional nobility and the construction of remarkable palaces; in the 19th century by industrial growth and the suburban development of Uría Street; and finally in the 20th century by administrative and commercial development.

In October 1934, there was a left-wing revolt against the conservative government, based in several cities. In Asturias, the fighting developed into a small, short-lived civil war: the [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934]]. 50,000 workers, mostly miners, armed themselves with dynamite and captured Oviedo after heavy fighting. They gained control of the arsenal with 30,000 rifles and machine guns. The Army Chief of Staff, General [[Francisco Franco]] sent in soldiers who overpowered the rebels after severe street fighting that left 3,000 rebels dead and 7,000 wounded. The cathedral was badly damaged, with its eighth-century chapel blown up by a mine. In the aftermath, many false atrocity stories circulated.<ref>Gerald Brennan, The Spanish Labyrinth: An Account of the Social and Political Background of the Spanish Civil War (2nd ed. 1950) pp 285-87</ref>

The [[Siege of Oviedo]] in 1936 was a memorable event in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The army garrison rose in support of the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]] [[Spanish coup of July 1936|coup d'état]] and withstood a siege of three months by an improvised [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] force until relieved in 1937.

==Geography==
Oviedo is located in the centre of Asturias between the [[Nalón (river)|Nalón River]] and [[Nora River]]. To the north lie [[Las Regueras]] and [[Llanera, Asturias|Llanera]], to the south [[Mieres|Mieres del Camino]] and [[Ribera de Arriba]], to the east [[Siero]] and [[Langreo]], and to the west [[Grado, Asturias|Grado]] and [[Santo Adriano]]. The altitude of Oviedo is between 80 and 709 metres above sea level. The city is protected against strong winds by [[Monte Naranco]] in the north and the [[Sierra del Aramo]] in the south. The city centre is rather hilly.

==Economy==
The economy is strongly dependent on the [[service sector]], with many office buildings in the city centre. Oviedo's status as the administrative centre of the region supports a large number of jobs in public administration. The [[manufacturing sector]], which remains important in this part of Spain, is not prevalent in Oviedo itself, but is more important in the adjacent municipalities of [[Siero]] and [[Llanera, Asturias|Llanera]] which lie to the north of the city, between Oviedo and [[Gijon]]. In 2009, the municipality had a total debt of €135 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.meh.es/Documentacion/Publico/AdministracionElectronica/Oficina%20Virtual%20Entidades%20Locales/Informe_Deuda_Local_2009.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Informe_Deuda_Local_2009 |access-date=2013-03-12 |archive-date=4 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104012933/http://www.meh.es/Documentacion/Publico/AdministracionElectronica/Oficina%20Virtual%20Entidades%20Locales/Informe_Deuda_Local_2009.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Architecture==
Oviedo contains a very rich architectural history, with many buildings dating back to the early medieval period. Many of the building projects were undertaken during [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II]]'s (791-842) reign and [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro I]]'s (842-850) reign. [[Alfonso III of Asturias|Alfonso III]]'s contributions are not as well documented.

Alfonso II is said to have built four churches, one dedicated to Christ the Saviour, the Blessed Virgin Mary, St. Tyrsus, and SS Julian and Basilissa. There are few traces of the churches dedicated to the Saviour, the Virgin Mary, and St. Tyrsus. The [[Cathedral of San Salvador, Oviedo|San Salvador church]], which was dedicated to the Saviour, is likely beneath the Cathedral of Oviedo. The church of [[Church of Santa María de la Corte|Santa Maria de la Corte]], which was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, was demolished in 1702.<ref name="Collins 2012, p.109">Collins 2012, p.109</ref>  As for St. Tyrsus, the church dedicated to him exists today as the [[Church of San Tirso, Oviedo|church of San Tirso]]. Only a wall and a three light window are believed to have been built by Alfonso II, the majority of the rest of the church is dated to the 14th century.<ref>Collins, Roger. ''Spain: an Oxford archaeological guide''. Oxford University Press, 1998, p.217-219</ref> The best preserved church constructed during Alfonso II's time was [[San Julian de los Prados]].
[[File:Oviedo Landscape (230140305).jpeg|thumb|left|290px|Panoramic view of Oviedo]]
Two buildings are said to have been built during Ramiro I's reign, one was a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary and the other construction was a palace. These were built just outside Oviedo, on Monte Lignum. The church [[Santa María del Naranco|Santa Maria de Naranco]] seems to originally have been a palace, but later repurposed into a church. The church has an atypical plan from other churches at its time, possibly because it was supposed to contain a throne room for the king. The other church built during Ramiro I's time was [[San Miguel de Lillo]].<ref name="Collins 2012, p.109"/>

[[Codex Vigilanus|The Chronicle of Albelda]], one of the primary sources used to discern which King commissioned which building, only extends to 883. Because of this, constructions undertaken during Alfonso III's time as king were not documented.<ref name="Collins 2012, p.81"/>

The following is a list of the notable architectural sites in Oviedo:
* [[Cathedral of San Salvador (Oviedo)|Cathedral of San Salvador]], was erected in 1388 over the previous cathedral, which was founded in the 8th century. The original church was built by [[Fruela I of Asturias|Fruela I the Cruel]] (757), and then built upon by Alfonso II (791-842). The Tower on the south side of the church was erected in 1556. The north tower was never completed.<ref name="Collins 1998, p.217-9">Collins 1998, p.217-9</ref>
* [[Cámara Santa, Oviedo|Cámara Santa de Oviedo]]. Dating from 802. It is located within the Cathedral, attached to the southern transept of the cathedral, and it is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Houses the [[Arca Santa]] chest reliquary of the [[Sudarium of Oviedo]]. The Cámara Sancta houses many Christian treasures. It contained the great gold and jeweled cross of victory for Alfonso III, which was made for housing a wooden cross used by the first Asturian king, Pelayo. The wooden cross was supposedly used in the Asturian victory at the battle of the Covadonga in 718. The Arca Sancta itself, which is covered with decorated silver plates, was commissioned by Alfonso VI (1072–1109).<ref name="Collins 1998, p.217-9"/>
* [[Santa María del Naranco]] Hall, 9th century. A relatively large pavilion, part of a palace complex built for the King Ramiro I.
* [[San Miguel de Lillo]] (small church), 9th century.
* Basilica of [[San Julián de los Prados]]. This church was originally constructed by Alfonso II (791-842), and is one of the best preserved Asturian churches. The church features a fresco decoration style. Although it was reported to have been placed near a palace, no trace of such palace has been found. Ideologically it would appear that church was opposed to religious imagery, which seems to parallel the iconoclast movement in the Byzantine Empire. However, there was no documentation of this ideal circulating in Spain at this point in time, so the Asturian stance on iconoclasm should not be inferred from this fact.<ref>Collins 1998, 217-9</ref>
* [[La Foncalada]]. Fountain of the 9th century. It is the only preserved [[Pre-Romanesque]] civil work in the whole of [[Europe]].
* The [[Universidad de Oviedo|University of Oviedo]] was created in 1574, but only inaugurated on September 21, 1608, the feast of [[Saint Matthew]]. It was funded by the terms of the will of Archbishop D. Fernando Valdés Salas, minister and General Inquisitor under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]].
* Town Hall (Casa Consistorial). Dates from 1662.
* [[Capilla de la Balesquida|La Balesquida Chapel]] (13th century). Associated with Oviedo's taylors' guild. Repeatedly restored in the 17th, 19th and 20th centuries. It is dedicated to the Virgin of Hope.
* House of the Llanes (18th century). It is the best [[Baroque]] façade in the whole of Asturias.
* Deán Payarinos' House (20th century). A building on the Beaux Arts style. Nowadays, it houses the [[Eduardo Martínez Torner Conservatory]].
* The [[San Vicente de Oviedo|Monastery of San Vicente]] (8th century). At the moment, home of the [[Archaeological Museum of Asturias]].
* The Convent [[Santo Domingo de Guzmán, Oviedo|Church of Santo Domingo, Oviedo]] (16th century). One of the monastic settlements outside the city walls. The original building burnt down in 1934 and it was heavily reconstructed after the Civil War.
* El Fontán Market (17th-18th centuries). A simple but rather monumental complex; an 18th-century porticoed square, which housed the vegetable market. It fell victim to speculative manoeuvres. It was left to deteriorate on its own; claiming that it was beyond repair, it was then demolished in 1998 and rebuilt offering all modern amenities, but with its original proportions radically changed; the original complex being much lower than its modern replacement.
* Casas del Cuitu, early 20th century [[Art Nouveau]] apartment building.
* [[Palacio de Congresos de Oviedo]] projected by [[Santiago Calatrava]].
*[[Church of San Tirso, Oviedo|Church of San Tirso]], or the Church of Saint Thyrsus, is located south west of the main cathedral. Only the east end of the church can trace its roots to Alfonso II's reign, with the rest of the church created during the 14th century. The triple arcaded window and east wall are the only portions of the church made during the early 9th century.<ref name="Collins 1998, p.217-9"/>
* [[Camposagrado Palace (Oviedo)|Camposagrado Palace]] built in 1728 and 1744 combining baroque and neo-classical architectures. It is presently the home of the Regional Court of Asturias.<ref name="Vasquez de Prada (2011)">{{cite web|last1=Vasquez de Prada|first1=Fernanadez|title=Palacio de los Marqueses de Camposagrado en Oviedo/Arquitecto de la Riva Ladron de Guevara|url=http://patrimonioarquitectonicodeasturias.blogspot.mx/2011/11/palacio-de-los-marquese-de-camposafrado.html|website=Patrimonio Arquitectónico de Asturias|publisher=Patrimonio Arquitectónico de Asturias|access-date=2015-05-05|language=es|date=4 November 2011|archive-date=20 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120081427/http://patrimonioarquitectonicodeasturias.blogspot.mx/2011/11/palacio-de-los-marquese-de-camposafrado.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Climate==
Oviedo's climate is temperate oceanic (Cfb in the [[Köppen climate classification]]). Its climate is very similar to neighbouring city Gijón, with only slightly wider fluctuations in temperature due to its higher altitude and  more inland location. Oviedo's warmest month is in August with an average high of {{convert|23.3|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=1249I&k=ast|title=Standard Climate values for Oviedo|publisher=Aemet.es|access-date=2015-07-22|archive-date=22 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722185330/http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=1249I&k=ast|url-status=live}}</ref> The city centre is located at a lower elevation than the weather station so is likely somewhat milder year-round since both are located in an upwards gradient away from the sea. Its maritime position renders winters much milder than in continental Spain such as in the [[Madrid]] capital region, but summers naturally are far less hot than in the interior. There is a slight drying tendency during summer, albeit less than in other areas of Spain.
