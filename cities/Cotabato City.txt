'''Cotabato City''', officially the '''City of Cotabato''' ([[Maguindanao language|Maguindanaon]]: ''Kuta nu Kutawatu'', [[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]: {{Script/Arabic|كوت نو كوتوات}}; [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]: ''Dakbayan sa Cotabato''; {{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Cotabato}}), is a first class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|independent component city]] in the [[Bangsamoro|Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]], Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 325,079 people,{{PH census|current|12}} making it as the most populated city under the independent component city status.

Cotabato City was formerly a part and the regional center of [[Soccsksargen|Region XII]], but due to the ratification of the [[Bangsamoro Organic Law]], it is now part of Bangsamoro and serves as the regional center. Being an independent component city, it is not a subject to regulation from the Provincial Government of [[Maguindanao del Norte]] where it is geographically located. The [[Philippine Statistics Authority]] also lists Cotabato City as statistically independent.<ref name="info page">{{cite web|title=Cotabato City|url=http://pia.gov.ph/chartered-cities/cotabato-city|publisher=Philippine Information Agency, Government of the Republic of the Philippines|access-date=May 7, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170618041552/http://pia.gov.ph/chartered-cities/cotabato-city |archive-date=June 18, 2017}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> It was the capital of the [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]].

Cotabato City is distinct from and should not be confused with the province of [[Cotabato]].

== History ==
[[File:Map of Maguindanao 1521.png|thumb|left|Territory of the Sultanate of Maguindanao in 1521 and Cotabato City serving as its capital.]]
Prior to the arrival of Hindus and Muslims, the city was a vast swamp and rainforest landscape where numerous ethno-linguistic groups lived. Maguindanao vernacular architecture developed during this era, which included the architectural techniques of at least 10 ethno-linguistic groups. Later on, Hindu traders arrived and the people of the area embraced the practice of [[Hinduism]]. The set of moral standards and culture of present-day people of Maguindanao are seen due to this Hindu influence.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Williams |first1=Mark S. |title=Mandala and its significance in Magindanao Muslim society |url=https://epublications.bond.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1101&context=cm |website=epublications.bond.edu.au |access-date=November 27, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Castro |first1=Alex B. |title=Mindanao Royalty: In the Realm of Muslim Majesties |url=https://www.townandcountry.ph/people/heritage/mindanao-royalty-history-a2087-20180827-lfrm3 |website=townandcountry.ph |publisher=Town & Country |access-date=November 27, 2018 |archive-date=November 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127110329/https://www.townandcountry.ph/people/heritage/mindanao-royalty-history-a2087-20180827-lfrm3 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Sultanate of Maguindanao ===
[[File:Datu Piang HD-SN-99-01980.JPEG|thumb|left|Datu Piang (4th from left) with American officers circa 1899. He was the first governor of the [[Cotabato (historical province)|Empire Province of Cotabato]]; Cotabato City was once the capital of the province from 1920 to 1967.]]
By 1515, after a successful Muslim establishment in Sulu, Muslim merchants went to Maguindanao and converted many Maguindanaoans to [[Islam]]. Those that did not accept the arrival of the Muslims went into higher ground or the interior of the island and became the [[Teduray]], as well as other [[lumad]] groups. During the same year, the [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]] was formally established, with Tubok as its initial capital. However, the sultan's seat would eventually be transferred in 1711 at around Tamontaka, a barangay within modern-day Cotabato. In 1861, Spain would eventually establish a garrison in Maguindanao and establish Kuta Watu, which was eventually renamed as Cotabato, as its new capital.<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal |last=Laarhoven |first=Ruurdje |date=1 March 1986 |title=WE ARE MANY NATIONS: THE EMERGENCE OF A MULTI-ETHNIC MAGUINDANAO SULTANATE |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/06d7623c-d292-3815-afc6-e2edb14800d8?read-now=1&seq=14 |journal=Philippine Quarterly of Culture and Society |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=32–53 |via=JSTOR}}</ref>

=== Spanish and American occupation ===
[[File:Philippine Island - Mindanao - NARA - 68156164.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Cotabato, circa pre-1944]]

The [[Spanish Empire]] had defeated the [[Sulu Sultanate]] in war and forced it to sign an unfavorable peace treaty in 1851.<ref>{{cite web |title=Brief memorandum on the government of the Sultanate of Sulu and powers of the Sultan during the 19th century |date=December 8, 1946 |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1946/12/08/brief-memorandum-on-the-government-of-the-sultanate-of-sulu-and-powers-of-the-sultan-during-the-19th-century/ |access-date=October 13, 2021 |archive-date=September 12, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912220954/https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1946/12/08/brief-memorandum-on-the-government-of-the-sultanate-of-sulu-and-powers-of-the-sultan-during-the-19th-century/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> With the [[Moro Gulf]] and [[Illana Bay]] now open to Spanish traffic as a result of their victory over the Sulu Moros, this paved the way for the first steps for the conquest of the [[Maguindanao Sultanate]] several years later. To that end, Spanish [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionaries have already made their way as early as 1859 at [[Parang, Maguindanao|Polloc]] where they earned several hundred converts, but the place was deemed unsuitable in account of its less than optimal ecology. And so the Spanish district governor of Mindanao based in [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]] requested Datu Amirul, the father of present Sultan of Maguindanao Muhammad Makakua, for them to establish a military base at the stone fortress at Kota Wato in what is now Barangay Tamontaka, and Datu Amirul gave the consent. The Spanish then established themselves at the said fort, raising the Spanish flag there and renamed it Cotabato, the Hispanized form of its name, on April 30, 1861. The Spanish and the Moro chiefs and locals then had a conference later the same day which stipulated the Maguindanaoan locals of Cotabato are now subjects of the Spanish Crown but their Islamic beliefs would be respected. Thus, on April 30, 1861, in the flood plains of Tamontaka, the town of Cotabato was officially born.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Jose S.

Under the reign of Sultan Muhammad Makakua, who while being the nominal sultan of Maguindanao was at this point under complete Spanish [[vassalage]], roads and wharves were built in Cotabato, specifically where the [[Rio Grande de Mindanao|Tamontaka River]] was situated. Forests were felled and cleared by the new Catholic [[Teduray people|Tiruray]] converts of Tamontaka to make way for the expansion of the newly established town.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Jose S.

Following the Spanish evacuation in Jan. 1899, Datu Piang led the Moro's in a massacre of the remaining Christian community, enslaving those they did not kill.<ref name=Foreman>Foreman, J., 1906, ''The Philippine Islands: A Political, Geographical, Ethnographical, Social and Commercial History of the Philippine Archipelago'', New York: Charles Scribner's Sons</ref>{{rp|529–530}}  Americans arrived in Mindanao in 1900 after the [[Spanish–American War]] ended in 1898. Cotabato town was part of [[Moro Province]] and of [[Department of Mindanao and Sulu]] from 1903 to 1920, when the [[Cotabato (historical province)|Empire Province of Cotabato]],{{Disputed inline|Talk page section|date=June 2020}} referred to as "Moroland" by the Americans, was founded with the town as the capital, with [[Datu Piang]] as its first governor.<ref name="info page"/>

=== Cotabato ===
Several towns were carved off from Cotabato town since the year 1913, with [[Pikit, Cotabato|Pikit]] being the first one founded by Cebuano Christian colonists. Dulawan (now [[Datu Piang, Maguindanao]]) and [[Midsayap, Cotabato|Midsayap]] were incorporated as regular municipalities in 1936. In 1942, at the beginning of the [[Pacific War|Pacific Front]] of [[World War II]], the Japanese Imperial forces entered what is now Maguindanao province. In 1945, Maguindanao was liberated by allied Philippine Commonwealth troops and Muslim Maguindanaoan guerrilla units after defeating the Japanese Imperial forces in the [[Battle of Maguindanao]] during the Second World War.<ref name="info page"/> On August 18, 1947, just two years after the Second World War and a year after the official inauguration of Philippine independence, the number of towns in the gigantic Cotabato province were multiplied by Executive Order No. 82 signed by President [[Manuel Roxas]], namely: [[Kidapawan]], [[Pagalungan, Maguindanao|Pagalungan]], [[General Santos|Buayan]], [[Koronadal|Marbel]], [[Parang, Maguindanao|Parang]], [[Sultan Kudarat, Maguindanao|Nuling]], [[Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao|Dinaig]], [[Lebak, Sultan Kudarat|Salaman]], [[Buluan, Maguindanao|Buluan]], [[Kiamba, Sarangani|Kiamba]], and [[Kabacan, Cotabato|Cabacan]], a total of eleven (11) towns added to the previous four towns; the newly founded towns of [[Kabuntalan, Maguindanao|Kabuntalan]], Pikit (conversion as regular municipality), and [[Glan, Sarangani|Glan]] added up on September 30, 1949. More and more newly created towns added up in the province's number of towns as the province entered the second half of the 20th century.<ref name="info page"/>

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
[[File:Cotabato City Flag.jpg|thumb|Former flag of Cotabato City]]
The city was chartered when President [[Carlos P. Garcia]] signed into law the ''Republic Act No. 2364'' on June 20, 1959. Authored then by Senator [[Salipada K. Pendatun]]. <ref>{{cite web |title=REPUBLIC ACT NO. 2364 |url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno2364.html |website=chanrobles.com |publisher=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library |access-date=November 27, 2018}}</ref> Under the said charter, the city was politically sibdivided into five (5) Barangays namely Poblacion, Rosary Heights, Bagua, Kalanganan, and Tamontaka. In 1989, the existing Barangays were split up which resulted into 32 more Barangays, presently the City has 37 Barangays.

The city used to be part of the [[Cotabato (historical province)|original Province of Cotabato]] and was its capital from 1920 until 1967, a year after the separation of [[South Cotabato]]; since then the city was the administrative center of the ARMM when [[Maguindanao]] was carved out in 1973.

On December 22, 1979, along with [[Manila]], [[Quezon City]], [[Caloocan]], [[Pasay]], [[Batangas City]], [[Lipa, Batangas|Lipa]], [[Iloilo City]], and other cities in the country, Cotabato became a highly urbanized city.

However, the city broke off administratively from Maguindanao as it rejoined [[Soccsksargen]] in the 1990s. Now many sources consider the city as part of the present [[Cotabato province]], although geographically it is still considered part of Maguindanao.<ref name="info page"/>

=== Inclusion in the Bangsamoro region ===
The city has traditionally resisted efforts for its inclusion to the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] despite serving as the government center of the region. Despite this, the city's residents voted for their locality's inclusion in the new [[Bangsamoro|Bangsamoro Autonomous Region]] by voting to ratify the [[Bangsamoro Organic Law]] in the January 21, [[2019 Bangsamoro Autonomous Region creation plebiscite|2019 plebiscite]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Solaiman |first1=Taher |title=Cotabato City formally joins Bangsamoro on Dec. 15 |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1366199/cotabato-city-formally-joins-bangsamoro-on-dec-15 |access-date=December 1, 2020 |work=Inquirer.net |date=November 30, 2020}}</ref> The city became ''de jure'' part of Bangsamoro following the plebiscite, as well as the government center of the new region. It became ''official'' part of the region after its formal turnover to the Bangsamoro regional government on December 15, 2020.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ropero |first1=Gillan |title=Cotabato City formally joins Bangsamoro gov't |url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/12/15/20/cotabato-city-formally-joins-bangsamoro-govt |access-date=December 15, 2020 |work=ABS-CBN News |date=December 15, 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

== Geography ==

Cotabato is approximately {{convert|698.9|nmi|km|abbr=off}} from [[Manila]], the country's capital, and is bounded by the [[Philippine municipality|municipalities]] of [[Sultan Kudarat, Shariff Kabunsuan|Sultan Kudarat]] to the north—with [[Rio Grande de Mindanao]]/[[Pulangi River]] separating the two—[[Kabuntalan, Shariff Kabunsuan|Kabuntalan]] to the east, and [[Datu Odin Sinsuat, Shariff Kabunsuan|Datu Odin Sinsuat]] to the south. The city faces [[Illana Bay]], part of the [[Moro Gulf]], to the west.

Cotabato City has a total land area of {{convert|176.0|km2}}, located at the mouth of the [[Rio Grande de Mindanao]] and [[Pulangi River]].<ref>Disaster Preparedness of Schools by Abdul Raffi A. Abas</ref>

===Urban Areas===
[[File:PC Hill Cotabato City.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pedro Colina Hill]]]]

Cotabato City has 27 urban barangays that are grouped into two major urban areas, the Down Town Area and the Upper Town Area.

'''Down Town Area''' The Downtown Area encompasses the barangays of Poblacion and Bagua, with a population exceeding 150,000. Situated below sea level, it faces constant flooding risks. Serving as Cotabato City's central hub for banking, trading, and commerce, it hosts over 20 banks and major wet markets like Mega Market and City Arcade. Additionally, prominent malls and supermarkets such as South Seas Mall, Puregold Main Branch, Sugni Super Store, and Superama (with 3 branches) are situated here, along with the upcoming KCC Mall of Cotabato. Notable educational institutions include Notre Dame University, Cotabato City Central Pilot School (the largest elementary school), STI Cotabato, and Notre Dame of Cotabato.

'''Upper Town Area''' The Upper Town Area, situated in the elevated regions of Cotabato City, encompasses all barangays of Rosary Heights and is home to the Peoples Palace (City Hall).

=== Topography ===

The city is situated in the lowest portion of Maguindanao del Norte. The City of Cotabato with its 37 barangays spans an area with marked landscapes of flat, level to nearly level, very gently sloping to gently undulations to moderately sloping or rolling. It is basically a delta formed by two big rivers, the Tamontaka River and the Rio Grande de Mindanao. Basically 70% of its total land area is below sea level. There are only 2 existing elevated areas in the city, the [[PC Hill]] and the Timako Hill with an altitude of 90 and 150 feet, respectively. At the foot of PC Hill is [[Tantawan Park]] and also hosts the [[Kutawato Caves|Kutang Bato Caves]].

Concentration of settlements and other urban uses are in the central portion while the southwestern and southeastern portion have mixed uses of agricultural land settlements. The city is criss-crossed by meandering and braided creeks and rivers like the Matampay, Parang, Timako, Esteros and Miwaruy.

These water bodies serve as sources of both agricultural, industrial and domestic water requirements of some rural barangays. These rivers also serve as the natural drainage flow of the city's wastes.

=== Barangays ===
Cotabato City is politically subdivided into 37 [[barangay]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Philippine Standard Geographic Code |url=https://psa.gov.ph/classification/psgc/?q=psgc/barangays/129804000&page=1 |website=psa.gov.ph |publisher=Philippine Statistics Authority |access-date=November 28, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Philippine Standard Geographic Code |url=https://psa.gov.ph/classification/psgc/?q=psgc/barangays/129804000&page=2 |website=psa.gov.ph |publisher=Philippine Statistics Authority |access-date=November 28, 2018}}</ref> Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s  while some have [[sitios]].
