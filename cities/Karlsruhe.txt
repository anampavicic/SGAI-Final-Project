Located on the right bank of the [[Rhine]] ([[Upper Rhine]]) near the French border, between the [[Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region|Mannheim-Ludwigshafen conurbation]] to the north and [[Strasbourg]] to the south, Karlsruhe is Germany's legal center, being home to the [[Federal Constitutional Court]], the [[Federal Court of Justice]] and the [[Public Prosecutor General (Germany)|Public Prosecutor General]].

Karlsruhe was the capital of the [[Margraviate of Baden-Durlach]] ([[Durlach]]: 1565–1718; Karlsruhe: 1718–1771), the [[Margraviate of Baden]] (1771–1803), the [[Electorate of Baden]] (1803–1806), the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]] (1806–1918), and the [[Republic of Baden]] (1918–1945). Its most remarkable building is [[Karlsruhe Palace]], which was built in 1715. It contains the [[Badisches Landesmuseum|Baden State Museum]], the large cultural, art and regional history museum of the Baden region of Baden-Württemberg. There are nine institutions of higher education in the city, most notably the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]]. [[Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden Airport]] is the second-busiest airport in Baden-Württemberg after [[Stuttgart Airport]], and the 17th-busiest airport in Germany.

==Geography==
[[File:49th Parallel Karlsruhe.JPG|thumb|left|The [[49th parallel north]] in the Karlsruhe Stadtgarten]]
Karlsruhe lies completely to the east of the [[Rhine]], and almost completely on the [[Upper Rhine Plain]]. It contains the [[Turmberg]] in the east, and also lies on the borders of the [[Kraichgau]] leading to the [[Northern Black Forest]].

The Rhine, one of the world's most important shipping routes, forms the western limits of the city, beyond which lie the towns of [[Maximiliansau]] and [[Wörth am Rhein]] in the German state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. The city centre is about {{convert|7.5|km|abbr=on}} from the river, as measured from the Marktplatz (Market Square). Two tributaries of the Rhine, the [[Alb (Upper Rhine)|Alb]] and the [[Pfinz]], flow through the city from the Kraichgau to eventually join the Rhine.

The city lies at an altitude of between {{Convert|100 and 322|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the higher figure being near the communications tower in the suburb of Grünwettersbach. Its geographical coordinates are {{Coord|49|00|N|8|24|E|type:city(282595)_region:DE-BW}}; the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]] runs through the city centre, which puts it at the same latitude as much of the [[Canada–United States border]] and the cities of [[Vancouver]] (Canada), [[Paris]] (France), [[Regensburg]] (Germany), and [[Hulunbuir]] (China). Its course is marked by a stone and painted line in the ''Stadtgarten'' (municipal park). The total area of the city is {{convert|173.46|km2|abbr=on}},  hence it is the 30th largest city in Germany measured by land area. The longest north–south distance is {{convert|16.8|km|abbr=on}} and {{convert|19.3|km|abbr=on}} in the east–west direction.

Karlsruhe is part of the urban area of Karlsruhe/Pforzheim, to which certain other towns in the [[Karlsruhe (district)|district of Karlsruhe]], such as [[Bruchsal]], [[Ettlingen]], [[Stutensee]], and [[Rheinstetten]], as well as the city of [[Pforzheim]], belong.

[[File:MiRO8.jpg|thumb|MiRO oil refinery]]

The city was planned with the palace tower (''Schloss'') at the center and 32&nbsp;streets radiating out from it like the [[spokes]] of a wheel, or the ribs of a [[fan (implement)|folding fan]], so that one [[nickname]] for Karlsruhe in German is the "fan city" (''Fächerstadt''). Almost all of these streets survive to this day. Because of this city layout, in [[metric geometry]], [[Karlsruhe metric]] refers to a measure of distance that assumes travel is only possible along radial streets and along circular avenues around the centre.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rashid Bin Muhammad |url=http://www.personal.kent.edu/~rmuhamma/Compgeometry/MyCG/CG-Applets/VoroKarlsruhe/karlcli.htm |title=Karlsruhe-Metric Voronoi Diagram |publisher=Personal.kent.edu |access-date=2011-04-07}}</ref>

The city centre is the oldest part of town and lies south of the palace in the quadrant defined by nine of the radial streets. The central part of the palace runs east–west, with two wings, each at a 45°&nbsp;angle, directed southeast and southwest (i.e.,&nbsp;parallel with the streets marking the boundaries of the quadrant defining the city center).

The [[market square]] lies on the street running south from the palace to [[Ettlingen]]. The market square has the [[town hall]] (''Rathaus'') to the west, the main [[Lutheran]] church (''Evangelische Stadtkirche'') to the east, and the tomb of [[Charles III William, Margrave of Baden-Durlach|Margrave Charles III William]] in [[Karlsruhe Pyramid|a pyramid]] in the buildings, resulting in Karlsruhe being one of only three large cities in Germany where buildings are laid out in the [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] style.

The area north of the palace is a park and forest. Originally the area to the east of the palace consisted of gardens and forests, some of which remain, but the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] (founded in 1825), [[Wildparkstadion]] football stadium, and residential areas have been built there. The area west of the palace is now mostly residential.

Wings of the palace align with streets, all radiating out from the centre of town, i.e.,&nbsp;the palace tower.]]

===Climate===
Karlsruhe experiences an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb'') and its winter climate is milder, compared to most other German cities, except for the [[Rhine-Ruhr#Climate|Rhine-Ruhr]] area. Summers are hot with several days registering maximum temperatures between {{Convert|35 and 40|C}}. With an average of more than 2,000 sunshine hours a year, it is also one of the sunniest cities in Germany, like the [[Rhine Palatinate|Rhine-Palatinate]] area.

Precipitation occurs mainly during the winter, while in summer it is concentrated on single evening thunderstorms. In 2008, the weather station in Karlsruhe, which had been in operation since 1876, was closed; it was replaced by a weather station in [[Rheinstetten]], south of Karlsruhe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wetter.im-licht-der-natur.de/Wetterstation.htm |title=Die Wetterstationen in Karlsruhe |publisher=Wetter.im-licht-der-natur.de |access-date=2013-03-26}}</ref>

== Districts ==
{{Main|Boroughs of Karlsruhe (city)}}
Karlsruhe is divided into 27 districts.

==History==
According to legend, the name ''Karlsruhe'', which translates as "Charles' repose" or "Charles' peace", was given to the new city after a hunting trip when Margrave [[Charles&nbsp;III William, Margrave of Baden-Durlach|Charles III William]] of [[Margraviate of Baden-Durlach|Baden-Durlach]] woke from a dream in which he dreamt of founding his new city. A variation of this story claims that he built the new palace to find peace from his wife.

Charles William founded the city on June 17, 1715, after a dispute with the citizens of his previous capital, [[Durlach]]. The founding of the city is closely linked to the construction of the [[Karlsruhe Palace|palace]]. Karlsruhe became the capital of [[Baden-Durlach]], and, in 1771, of the united [[Baden]] until 1945. Built in 1822, the ''Ständehaus'' was the first parliament building in a German state. In the aftermath of the democratic revolution of 1848, a republican government was elected there.

Karlsruhe was visited by [[Thomas Jefferson]] during his time as the American envoy to France; when [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]] was planning the layout of [[Washington, D.C.]], Jefferson passed to him maps of 12 European towns to consult, one of which was a sketch he had made of Karlsruhe during his visit.<ref>{{cite book|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=D5ypKh0Tg5oC&pg=PA35|title=Karlsruhe and the United States|pages=35–37|author=Volker C. Ihle|publisher=Sonstige|date= 2011|isbn=9783881903233}}</ref>

In 1860, the first-ever international professional [[convention (meeting)|convention]] of chemists, the [[Karlsruhe Congress]], was held in the city.<ref name="Ihde1961">{{cite journal |last1=Ihde |first1=Aaron J. |title=The Karlsruhe Congress: A centennial retrospective |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |date=February 1961 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=83–86 |doi=10.1021/ed038p83 |bibcode=1961JChEd..38...83I }}</ref>

In 1907 the town was site of the Hau Riot where large crowds caused disturbance during the trial of murderer [[Carl Hau]].

On [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, the Adass Jeshurun synagogue was burned to the ground, and the city's Jews were later sent to the [[Dachau concentration camp]], [[Gurs internment camp|Gurs concentration camp]], [[Theresienstadt]], and [[Auschwitz]] during [[the Holocaust]], with 1,421 of Karlsruhe's Jews being killed.<ref name="Yad Vashem - Request Rejected">{{Cite web|url=http://db.yadvashem.org/deportation/place.html?language=en&itemId=5433380|title=Yad Vashem – Request Rejected|website=db.yadvashem.org}}</ref> During [[World War II]], it was the location of a [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]] camp for men,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.2&tab=7&id=1988|title=Arbeitserziehungslager Karlsruhe|website=Bundesarchiv.de|access-date=26 November 2022|language=de}}</ref> and a subcamp of the Auschwitz concentration camp, whose prisoners were mainly [[Polish people|Poles]] and [[Russians]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.auschwitz.org/en/history/auschwitz-sub-camps/ss-bauzug/|title=SS Bauzug|website=Memorial and Museum Auschwitz-Birkenau|access-date=26 November 2022}}</ref>

{{anchor|Allied air attacks}}Much of the central area, including the palace, was reduced to rubble by [[Allied bombing of Germany|Allied bombing]] during World War II, but was rebuilt after the war. Located in the American zone of the [[Allied-occupied Germany|postwar Allied occupation]], Karlsruhe was home to an [[United States Armed Forces|American military]] base, established in 1945. After the war, the city was part of [[West Germany]] until 1990. In 1995, the bases [[List of United States Army installations in Germany#Former installations|closed]], and their facilities were turned over to the city of Karlsruhe.<ref>{{cite web |first=Walter |last=Elkins |url=http://www.usarmygermany.com/Sont.htm?http&&&www.usarmygermany.com/USAREUR_City_Karlsruhe.htm |title=U.S. Army Installations – Karlsruhe |publisher=U.S. Army in Germany |access-date=2012-07-21}}</ref>

Karlsruhe has a population of about 310,000 and is the 3rd largest city in [[Baden-Württemberg]]. Karlsruhe, which was founded by [[Charles III William, Margrave of Baden-Durlach|Charles III William]], became a major city in the 19th century. In the 1950s, Karlsruhe became a significant city where the population started to grow. It gained a large student population due to the university of technology and media arts. Karlsruhe reached populations of 200,000 in 1950 and 300,000 in 2014.

==Main sights==
The ''Stadtgarten'' is a recreational area near the main railway station (''Hauptbahnhof'') and was rebuilt for the 1967 [[Federal Garden Show]] (''Bundesgartenschau''). It is also the site of the [[Karlsruhe Zoo]].

The ''[[Durlach]]er [[Turmberg]]'' has a lookout tower (hence its name). It is a former [[keep]] dating back to the 13th century.

The city has two botanical gardens: the municipal ''[[Botanischer Garten Karlsruhe]]'', which forms part of the Palace complex, and the ''[[Botanischer Garten der Universität Karlsruhe]]'', which is maintained by the university.

[[File:Karlsruhe Orangerie garden panorama.jpg|thumb|center|700px|Panorama of the courtyard of [[Botanischer Garten Karlsruhe]]]]

The ''Marktplatz'' has a [[Karlsruhe Pyramid|stone pyramid]] marking the grave of the city's founder. Built in 1825, it is the emblem of Karlsruhe.
The city is nicknamed the "fan city" (''die Fächerstadt'') because of its design layout, with straight streets radiating fan-like from the Palace.

The [[Karlsruhe Palace]] (''Schloss'') is an interesting piece of architecture; the adjacent ''[[Schlossgarten (Karlsruhe)|Schlossgarten]]'' includes the Botanical Garden with a palm, cactus and orchid house, and walking paths through the woods to the north.

The so-called ''Kleine Kirche'' (Little Church), built between 1773 and 1776, is the oldest church of Karlsruhe's city centre.

The architect [[Friedrich Weinbrenner]] designed many of the city's most important sights. Another sight is the ''Rondellplatz'' with its 'Constitution Building Columns' (1826). It is dedicated to Baden's first constitution in 1818, which was one of the most liberal of its time. The ''Münze'' (mint), erected in 1826/27, was also built by Weinbrenner.

The St. Stephan parish church is one of the masterpieces of neoclassical church architecture in.<ref>Southern Germany</ref> Weinbrenner, who built this church between 1808 and 1814, orientated it to the [[Pantheon, Rome]].

[[File:Karlsruhe Grabkapelle.jpg|thumb|Grand Ducal burial chapel ''([[:de:Großherzogliche Grabkapelle Karlsruhe|Sepulchral chapel of the Grand Duchy of Baden in Karlsruhe]])'']]

The [[neo-Gothic]] Grand Ducal Burial Chapel, built between 1889 and 1896, is a [[mausoleum]] rather than a church, and is located in the middle of the forest.

The main [[commons:Category:Hauptfriedhof Karlsruhe|cemetery]] of Karlsruhe is the oldest park-like cemetery in Germany. The [[cremation|crematorium]] was the first to be built in the style of a church.

Karlsruhe is also home to a [[natural history museum]] (the [[State Museum of Natural History Karlsruhe]]), an [[opera house]] (the [[Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe|Baden State Theatre]]), as well as a number of independent theatres and art galleries. The [[Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe|State Art Gallery]], built in 1846 by [[Heinrich Hübsch]], displays paintings and sculptures from six centuries, particularly from France, Germany and Holland. Karlsruhe's newly renovated art museum is one of the most important art museums in [[Baden-Württemberg]]. Further cultural attractions are scattered throughout Karlsruhe's various incorporated suburbs. Established in 1924, the Scheffel Association is the largest [[literary society]] in Germany.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Today the ''Prinz-Max-Palais'', built between 1881 and 1884 in neoclassical style, houses the organisation and includes its museum.
[[File:Karlsruhe Moninger Jugendstil.jpg|thumb|Breweries and buildings in the [[Art Nouveau]] style were predominant in the western city.]]
Due to population growth in the late 19th century, Karlsruhe developed several suburban areas (''[[Vorstadt]]'') in the {{Lang|de|[[Gründerzeit]]}} and especially [[Art Nouveau]] styles of architecture, with many preserved examples.

Karlsruhe is also home to the ''Majolika-Manufaktur'',<ref>{{cite web|author=Staatliche Majolika Manufaktur Karlsruhe GmbH |url=http://www.majolika-karlsruhe.com/ |title=Majolika-Manufaktur |publisher=Majolika-karlsruhe.com |access-date=2011-04-07}}</ref> the only art-ceramics pottery studio in Germany.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Founded in 1901, it is located in the ''Schlossgarten''. A 'blue streak' (''Blauer Strahl'') consisting of 1,645 ceramic tiles, connects the studio with the Palace. It is the world's largest ceramic artwork.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Another tourist attraction is the [[Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe|Centre for Art and Media]] (''Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie'', or ZKM), which is located in a converted ammunition factory.

==Government==

===Justice===
[[File:Karlsruhe bundesverfassungsgericht.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]]]]
Karlsruhe is the seat of the German [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] ''(Bundesverfassungsgericht)'' and the highest [[Court of Appeals]] in civil and criminal cases, the ''[[Bundesgerichtshof]]''. The courts came to Karlsruhe after World War II, when the provinces of [[Baden Germany|Baden]] and [[Württemberg]] were merged. [[Stuttgart]], capital of Württemberg, became the capital of the new province ([[Württemberg-Baden]] in 1945 and [[Baden-Württemberg]] in 1952). In compensation for the state authorities relocated to Stuttgart, Karlsruhe applied to become the seat of the high court.<ref>Stadt Karlsruhe Stadtarchiv (ed.): ''Karlsruhe. Die Stadtgeschichte.'' Badenia, Karlsruhe 1998, {{ISBN|3-7617-0353-8}}, p. 591–594</ref>

===Public health===
There are four hospitals: The ''[[Karlsruhe Municipal Hospital]]'' provides the maximum level of medical services, the ''St. Vincentius-Kliniken'' and the ''[[Deaconess|Diakonissen]]<nowiki />krankenhaus'', connected to the Catholic and Protestant churches, respectively, offer central services, and the private ''Paracelsus-Klinik'' basic medical care, according to state hospital demand planning.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Economy==
Germany's largest [[oil refinery]] is located in Karlsruhe, at the western edge of the city, directly on the river [[Rhine]]. The ''Technologieregion Karlsruhe'' is a loose confederation of the region's cities in order to promote [[high tech]] industries; today, about 20% of the region's jobs are in [[research and development]]. [[EnBW]], one of Germany's biggest [[electric utility]] companies, with a revenue of €19.2&nbsp;billion in 2012,<ref>{{cite web|title=Financial Report 2012|url=https://www.enbw.com/media/konzern/docs/integrierte-berichterstattung/bericht-2012/enbw-finanzbericht-2012.pdf|publisher=EnBW|page=3}}</ref> is headquartered in the city.

===Internet activities===
Due to the [[University of Karlsruhe|Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] providing services until the late 1990, Karlsruhe became known as the ''internet capital'' of Germany.<ref>See [http://www.young-germany.de/topic/study/city-campus/karlsruhe-germanys-internet-capital] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930205718/http://www.young-germany.de/topic/study/city-campus/karlsruhe-germanys-internet-capital|date=2015-09-30}}, a webpage by the Federal Foreign Office</ref> The [[DENIC]], Germany's [[network information centre]], has since moved to Frankfurt, though, where [[DE-CIX]] is located.

Two major [[internet service provider]]s, [[WEB.DE]] and [[schlund+partner]]/[[1&1 Internet|1&1]], now both owned by [[United Internet]]&nbsp;AG, are located at Karlsruhe.

The library of the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] developed the [[Karlsruher Virtueller Katalog]], the first internet site that allowed researchers worldwide (for free) to search multiple library catalogues worldwide.

In 2000, the regional online newspaper ''ka-news.de'' was created. As a daily newspaper, it not only provides the news, but also informs readers about upcoming events in Karlsruhe and surrounding areas.
[[File:Karlsruhe Rbf Einfahrgruppe.jpg|thumb|[[Rail yard]], [[bypass (road)|bypass road]] Südtangente]]

In addition to established companies, Karlsruhe has a vivid and spreading startup community with well-known startups. Together, the local [[high tech]] industry is responsible for over 22,000 jobs.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.clusterportal-bw.de/clusterdatenbank/clusterdb/Clusterinitiative/show/clusterinitiative/cyberforum-e-v/ | title=Region: Mittlerer Oberrhein Informationstechnologie, IT-Anwendungen / Unternehmenssoftware | access-date=2015-05-08}}</ref>

==Transport==

=== Railway ===
The [[Verkehrsbetriebe Karlsruhe]] (VBK) operates the city's urban public transport network, comprising [[Trams in Karlsruhe|seven tram routes]] and a network of bus routes. All city areas can be reached round the clock by tram and a night bus system. The [[Turmbergbahn]] [[funicular|funicular railway]], to the east of the city centre, is also operated by the VBK. Similar to a [[premetro]] tramlines operating in the city centre use two tramway tunnels that were completed on 11 December 2021.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Seinsoth |first1=Dorothee |last2=Bender |first2=Markus |last3=Essig |first3=Jürgen |title=Offizielle Eröffnung: Viele Karlsruher wollen die neue U-Bahn sehen |url=https://www.swr.de/swraktuell/baden-wuerttemberg/karlsruhe/eroeffnung-kombiloesung-karlsruhe-100.html |website=Swr Aktuell (in German) |publisher=Südwestrundfunk |access-date=11 December 2021 |archive-date=21 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220121114050/https://www.swr.de/swraktuell/baden-wuerttemberg/karlsruhe/eroeffnung-kombiloesung-karlsruhe-100.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>
[[File:Durlacher Tor Kombilösung 3.jpg|thumb|A tram at the subterranean ''Durlacher Tor – [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology|KIT]] Campus Süd'' station]]
The VBK is also a partner, with the [[Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft]] and [[Deutsche Bahn]], in the operation of the [[Karlsruhe Stadtbahn]], the rail system that serves a larger area around the city. This system makes it possible to reach other towns in the region, like [[Ettlingen]], [[Wörth am Rhein]], [[Pforzheim]], [[Bad Wildbad]], [[Bretten]], [[Bruchsal]], [[Heilbronn]], [[Baden-Baden]], and even [[Freudenstadt]] in the [[Black Forest]] right from the city centre. The Stadtbahn is known for pioneering the concept of operating trams on train tracks, to achieve a more effective and attractive [[public transport]] system.

Karlsruhe is connected via road and rail, with [[Autobahn]] and [[Intercity Express]] connections going to [[Frankfurt]], [[Stuttgart]]/[[Munich]] and [[Freiburg]]/[[Basel]] from [[Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof]]. Since June 2007 it has been connected to the [[TGV]] network, reducing travel time to [[Paris]] to three hours (previously it had taken five hours).

The [[Rhine Valley Railway]] is also an important freight line.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Weinrich |first1=Regina |title=Sperrung der Rheintalbahn |url=https://www.eurotransport.de/artikel/sperrung-der-rheintalbahn-desaster-fuer-den-gueterverkehr-9200330.html |website=Eurotransport |date=16 August 2017 |access-date=9 December 2021}}</ref> Freight trains can bypass Karlsuhe Hauptbahnhof via the [[Karlsruhe freight bypass railway]].

=== Shipping ===
[[File:Karlsruhe OElhafen.jpg|thumb|Oil port]]
Two ports on the [[Rhine]] provide transport capacity on [[cargo ship]]s, especially for [[petroleum products]].

=== Airport ===
The nearest airport is part of the [[Baden Airpark]] (officially ''Flughafen Karlsruhe/[[Baden-Baden]]'') about {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Karlsruhe, with regular connections to airports in Germany and Europe in general. [[Frankfurt International Airport]] can be reached in about an hour and a half by car (one hour by [[Intercity Express]]); [[Stuttgart Airport]] can be reached in about one hour (about an hour and a half by train and [[S-Bahn]]).

=== Streets ===
Karlsruhe is at the [[Bundesautobahn 5]] and the [[Bundesstraße 10]]. In the city there is a good bike lane infrastructure.

Two interesting facts in transportation history are that both [[Karl Drais]], the inventor of the bicycle, as well as [[Karl Benz]], the inventor of the automobile were born in Karlsruhe. Benz was born in Mühlburg, which later became a borough of Karlsruhe (in 1886). Benz also studied at the Karlsruhe University. Benz's wife [[Bertha Benz|Bertha]] took the world's first long distance-drive with an automobile from [[Mannheim]] to Karlsruhe-Grötzingen and [[Pforzheim]] (see [[Bertha Benz Memorial Route]]). Their professional lives led both men to the neighboring city of Mannheim, where they first applied their most famous inventions.<gallery>

==Jewish community==
Jews settled in Karlsruhe soon after its founding.<ref name="Singer1906">"[https://books.google.com/books?id=SzsyAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA448 Karlsruhe (Carlsruhe)]" (1906). ''The Jewish Encyclopedia''. Ed. Isidore Singer. Vol. 7. p. 448-449.</ref> They were attracted by the numerous privileges granted by its founder to settlers, without discrimination as to creed. Official documents attest the presence of several Jewish families at Karlsruhe in 1717.<ref name="Singer1906"/> A year later the city council addressed to the margrave a report in which a question was raised as to the proportion of municipal charges to be borne by the newly arrived Jews, who in that year formed an organized congregation, with Rabbi Nathan Uri Kohen of [[Metz]] at its head. A document dated 1726 gives the names of twenty-four Jews who had taken part in an election of municipal officers.

As the city grew, permission to settle there became less easily obtained by Jews, and the community developed more slowly. A 1752 Jewry ordinance stated Jews were forbidden to leave the city on Sundays and Christian holidays, or to go out of their houses during church services, but they were exempted from service by court summonses on Sabbaths. They could sell wine only in inns owned by Jews and graze their cattle, not on the [[commons]], but on the wayside only. [[Nethaneel Weil|Nethanael Weill]] was a rabbi in Karlsruhe from 1750 until his death.

In 1783, by a decree issued by Margrave [[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden|Charles Frederick of Baden]], the Jews ceased to be [[serf]]s, and consequently could settle wherever they pleased. The same decree freed them from the ''Todfall'' tax, paid to the clergy for each Jewish burial. In commemoration of these changes special prayers were prepared by the acting rabbi Jedidiah Tiah Weill, who, succeeding his father in 1770, held the office until 1805.

In 1808 the new constitution of what at that time, during the [[Napoleonic era]], had become the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]] granted Jews citizenship status; a subsequent edict, in 1809, constitutionally acknowledged Jews as a religious group.<ref name="Dubnow1920">[[Simon Dubnow|Dubnow, Simon]] (1920).

Complete [[emancipation]] was given in 1862, Jews were elected to city council and Baden parliament, and from 1890 were appointed judges. Jews were persecuted in the [[Hep-Hep riots|'Hep-Hep' riots]] that occurred in 1819; and anti-Jewish demonstrations were held in 1843, 1848, and the 1880s. The well-known German-Israeli artist [[Leo Kahn (painter)|Leo Kahn]] studied in Karlsruhe before leaving for France and Israel in the 1920s and 1930s.

Today, there are about 900 members in the Jewish community, many of whom are recent immigrants from Russia, and an orthodox rabbi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jg-karlsruhe.de/index.php/de/|title=Aktuelles|website=jg-karlsruhe.de}}</ref>

=== Karlsruhe and the Shoah ===
On 28 October 1938, all Jewish men of Polish extraction were expelled to the Polish border, their families joining them later and most ultimately perishing in the ghettoes and concentration camps. On [[Kristallnacht]] (9–10 November 1938), the Adass Jeshurun synagogue was burned to the ground, the main synagogue was damaged, and Jewish men were taken to the Dachau concentration camp after being beaten and tormented. Deportations commenced on 22 October 1940, when 893 Jews were loaded onto trains for the three-day journey to the [[Gurs internment camp|Gurs concentration camp]] in France. Another 387 were deported in from 1942 to 1945 to lzbica in the Lublin district (Poland), Theresienstadt, and Auschwitz. Of the 1,280 Jews deported directly from Karlsruhe, 1,175 perished. Another 138 perished after deportation from other German cities or occupied Europe. In all, 1,421 of Karlsruhe's Jews died during the [[The Holocaust|Shoah]]. A new community was formed after the war by surviving former residents, with a new synagogue erected in 1971. It numbered 359 in 1980.<ref name="Yad Vashem - Request Rejected"/>
