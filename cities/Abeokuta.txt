Abeokuta is the headquarters of the federal Ogun-Oshun River Basin Authority, which is responsible for development of [[land]] and [[water]] resources for [[Lagos State|Lagos]], [[Ogun State|Ogun]], and [[Oyo State|Oyo]] states. Included in this are [[irrigation]], food-processing, and [[electrification]].<ref name=EB/>

Local industries include but not limited to fruit [[canning]] plants, plastics, breweries, sawmills, and an aluminum products factory. South of town are the Aro granite quarries.<ref name=EB/>

==Transportation==
[[File:Abeokuta220522.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the new railway station|left]]
Abeokuta is connected to nearby [[Lagos]] by [[Rail transport in Nigeria|a railway]] that was completed in 1899, with a length of {{convert|48|mi|km|order=flip}}. 
Since 2021 there is a standard gauge railway line Lagos-Ibadan, which stops at Abeokuta.<ref>{{cite web|author=Segun Adewole |url=https://punchng.com/buhari-inaugurates-lagos-ibadan-railway-project/ |title=Buhari inaugurates Lagos-Ibadan Railway project |editor=The Punch Newspaper |date=2021-06-10 |language=en |via=2021-12-04}}</ref> For this a new railway building has been built in Abeokuta.

== History ==
An account suggests that the early Abeokuta settlements were established by Yoruba migrants from various places within [[Yorubaland|Yoruba land]]. According to ''The History of the Yorubas'' by [[Samuel Johnson (Nigerian historian)|Samuel Johnson]], [[Eso Ikoyi]] chiefs in the retinue of the first [[Alake of Egba (title)|Alake of the Egba]] joined him in founding a new community — the confederacy of towns that became known as Orile Egba — in the forest after they left the nascent [[Oyo empire]] in around the 13th century AD.<ref>Sotunde, F.I. (2002), "Egba Chieftaincy Institution", p 61. </ref> Orile Egba continued to exist until its destruction during the [[Yoruba Revolutionary Wars|Yoruba Civil Wars]] of the 19th century. As a result, many of the leading families of the Egba claim descent from the Eso Ikoyis today.

Abeokuta was founded as a replacement for Orile Egba in around 1830 by the Egbas after the collapse of the Oyo empire during the civil war. The city was founded because of its strong defensive physical position by refugees trying to protect themselves against slave raiders from [[Dahomey]], who were trying to benefit from the war.<ref> Blair, J.H. (1937), Intelligence Report on Abeokuta. </ref>

The Owu-focused account states that in 1817, the [[Oyo Empire]] dissolved into civil war. Refugees displaced by the collapse of Oyo joined with the [[Ijebu Kingdom|Ijebu]] in their war against the [[Owu Kingdom|Owu]] in southern [[Yorubaland]], which had broken out around the same time. Following the fall of Owu in around 1822, the leading [[Ana people|Ife]] and [[Ijebu Kingdom|Ijebu]] generals returned to their respective homes, but the rest of the armies that had allied with the Oyo refugees were invited by the Ijebus to Ipara, which they made their headquarters for further attacks against several towns in the region. This group then turned their attention to waging war with the [[Egba people|Egba]], a loose confederacy of towns that had been established by [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] migrants in the 13th century and were spread throughout the forested land between [[Ipara]] and [[Ibadan]]. The group conquered and destroyed many of these towns, eventually settling in one of the villages that had not been completely destroyed, [[Ibadan]], which they used as their headquarters for additional conquests.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Law |first1=Robin |editor1-last=Middleton |editor1-first=John |title=Encyclopedia of Africa south of the Sahara |date=1997 |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |location=New York |ol=684550M |edition=4th |url=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL684550M/Encyclopedia_of_Africa_south_of_the_Sahara}}</ref><ref name="C.M.S.

Conflict between the various groups arose, and in one incident, an Egba chief named Lamodi shot an [[Ana people|Ife]] chief named Ege to death with a pistol at a public meeting before himself being killed in the ensuing commotion. Fearing [[Ana people|Ife]] reprisal, most of the Egba population withdrew as a group to an encampment about 3 or 4 miles distant on the other side of the Ona River. Here they enlisted Sodeke to be their leader and migrated to a hilly area known as [[Olumo Rock]], where they established the town of Abeokuta around 1830 at what was then a small farming village.<ref name="C.M.S. Nigeria Bookshops" /><ref>{{cite book |last1=Usman |last2=Falola |title=The Yoruba from Prehistory to the Present |date=2019 |publisher= |location= |page=170}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Davies |first1=Lanre |editor1-last=Jimoh |editor1-first=Mufutau Oluwasegun |editor2-last=Oloruntola |editor2-first=Philip |title=The Balogun in Yoruba land: The Changing Fortunes of a Military Institution |date=2016 |publisher=Bookbuilders |location=Ibadan |pages=153–154}}</ref>

Nevertheless, all accounts agree that in the 19th century, the [[Olumo Rock]] became a place of refuge for displaced Yoruba people during the [[Yoruba Revolutionary Wars]], and from the Dahomey slave hunters.<ref> Blair, J.H. (1937), Intelligence Report on Abeokuta. </ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Usman |last2=Falola |first2=Toyin |title=The Yoruba from Prehistory to the Present |date=2019 |publisher= |location= |page=171}}</ref> People were scattered throughout the landscape, taking shelter among the rocks surrounding the settlement. The Egba who established Abeokuta were soon joined by other Egba refugees and a substantial number of Owu who had escaped their captors. It became a busy metropolis and home to the majority of the Egba. However, the various groups of Egba did not fuse into a single community; rather, Abeokuta functioned more as a "federation of communities within a town wall than a community in its own right".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Usman |last2=Falola |first2=Toyin |title=The Yoruba from Prehistory to the Present |date=2019 |publisher= |location= |page=171}}</ref>

[[File:A short oral history of Egba in Egba Language by its native speaker.webm|thumb|A short introductory expose of The Egbas in Egba dialect by a native speaker]]

Because Abeokuta was in a key location for the palm oil trade and because it was the so-called capital of the Egbas, [[Dahomey]] soon became hostile. In the 1851 Battle of Abeokuta, the Egba defeated [[King Gezo]] and the Dahomey incursion. They again beat back the Dahomey military in 1864.<ref name="EB" /><ref name="canby">Canby, Courtlandt. ''The Encyclopedia of Historic Places''. (New York: Facts on File Publications, 1984), p. 2.</ref>

The 1860s also saw problems arise with the Europeans, namely the British in Lagos, which led to the Egba first closing trade routes, followed by the expulsion of missionaries and traders in 1867.<ref name=EB/>
Between 1877 and 1893 the Yoruba Civil Wars occurred, and Abeokuta opposed [[Ibadan]], which led the king or ''alake'' of the Egba to sign an alliance with the British governor, [[Gilbert Thomas Carter|Sir Gilbert Carter]]. This occurred in 1893, which formalized the [[Egba United Government]] based in Abẹokuta which became recognized by the United Kingdom.<ref name=EB/> In 1914, the Egba lands were incorporated into the colony of Nigeria by the British, with Abeokuta as the provincial capital.<ref name=EB/><ref name="canby"/>

In 1918, an uprising took place, the [[Adubi War]], which was related to the levying of taxes and the policy of indirect rule by [[Frederick Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard|Sir Frederick Lugard]], the British Governor-General.<ref name=EB/> This was the only internal threat to British control of Nigeria during the course of the [[First World War]].<ref name=EB14>{{cite encyclopedia |year=1930 |title=Abeokuta |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica |edition=14|volume=1|page=34 |language=en}}</ref>

The [[Abeokuta Women's Revolt]], led by the Abeokuta Women's Union (AWU), took place in the 1940s. It was a resistance movement against the imposition of unfair taxation by the Nigerian colonial government.<ref name="Byfield, Judith A 2003">{{cite journal |last=Byfield |first=Judith A. |title=Taxation, Women, and the Colonial State: Egba Women's Revolt |journal=Meridians: Feminism, Race, Transnationalism |volume=3 |issue=2 |year=2003 |pages=250–77 |jstor=40338582 }}</ref>

In 1976, Abeokuta became the capital of the newly created [[Ogun State]].{{verify source|date=January 2024}}<ref>{{Cite news |last=awujale |title=obasanjo-made-abeokuta-ogun-state-capital |work=Vanguard |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/09/obasanjo-made-abeokuta-ogun-state-capital-awujale/amp/}}</ref>

== Tourism ==
[[File:Stair case at Olumo rock, Abeokuta.jpg|thumb|Olumo Rock in Abeokuta]]
Abeokuta's name already refers to several rock formations in the neighbourhood, especially [[Olumo Rock]]. Visitors should be aware that the rock has a spiritual significance and respectful behaviour is therefore strongly recommended.
[[File:OLUSEGUN OBASANJO PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY OKE-MOSAN ABEOKUTA.jpg|left|thumb|Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library]]
The Presidential Library of [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] is another tourist destination in Abeokuta. (As a colonel in the [[Nigerian Civil War|Biafra War]], Obasanjo carried out the decisive operation to defeat the secessionist region of Biafra, was later Chief of Staff under dictator Murtala Mohammed, escaped assassination by mistaken identity during a coup, became dictator himself and led his country into democracy; was on death row under [[Sani Abacha]] and then democratically elected twice as the first president of the Fourth Republic which still exists today). The library is less a library than a museum about the eventful life of the general and politician.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (Abeokuta) - Lohnt es sich?
