Between 1884 and 1918 the [[German New Guinea Company]] established trading posts in [[Kaiser-Wilhelmsland|Kaiser Wilhelmsland]], [[German New Guinea]] and on 12 July 1886, a German missionary, [[Johann Flierl]], a pioneer missionary for the Southern Australian Lutheran Synod and the [[Johann Flierl#Connection to Neuendettelsau Mission Society|Neuendettelsau Mission Society]], sailed to Simbang in [[Finschhafen]], [[Kaiser-Wilhelmsland]] and arrived at Lae shortly after.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elcpng.org.pg/Who-We-Are-History.htm |title=History – Evangelical Lutheran Church of Papua New Guinea |work=elcpng.org.pg  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130202912/http://www.elcpng.org.pg/Who-We-Are-History.htm |archive-date=30 November 2012 }}</ref> The mission society provided clergy and religious education for Lutheran settlements in Missouri, Iowa and Ohio, Australia, and anywhere else "free thinking" Lutherans had settled.<ref>Garrett, p. 3–4; [https://archive.today/20120722061530/http://www.ccel.org/php/disp.php?authorID=schaff&bookID=encyc07&page=9&view=png Löhe, Johann Konrad Wilhelm] (''New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge'', Vol. VII)</ref>

On 1 January 1923 Levien acquired a mining right for the area and shortly after formed a syndicate called ''Guinea Gold (No Liability)''.<ref>Kernot, C, 1999, Valuing Mining Companies: A Guide to the Assessment and Evaluation of Assets, Performance, and Prospects in ''Business and Economics'' CRC Press [https://books.google.com/books?id=QxG1RujIlLMC&q=Guinea+Gold+(No+Liability)]</ref> The Guinea Gold syndicate formed Guinea Airways Limited in November 1927.<ref>Australian Dictionary of Biography, ''Volume 10'', (MUP), 1986 Levien, Cecil John (1874–1932) [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/levien-cecil-john-7179]</ref> In 1927 Levien arranged for the construction of the airstrip at Lae to assist the gold mine productions around [[Wau, Papua New Guinea|Wau]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=su8-AQAAIAAJ&q=Cecil+J.+Levien+Lae+airport Lipscomb, A, McKinnon, R & Murray, J 1998 ''Lonely Planet'']</ref>

Lae was declared a town under the ''New Guinea Boundaries Ordinance'' on 31 March 1931 at the height of the gold rush era<ref>Mason, L, & Hereniko, P, 1987 ''In Search of a Home'', University of the South Pacific.

In July 1937, Lae made world news when American aviator [[Amelia Earhart]] was last seen flying out of the airport on her way back to the United States. She was never seen again.

When the volcanic eruptions occurred in [[Rabaul]] in 1937, a decision was made to transfer the capital of the Territory of New Guinea to Lae. World War II impeded the transfer and the town was [[Invasion of Lae-Salamaua|occupied]] by the [[Empire of Japan]] on 8 March 1942. Lae, Rabaul and [[Salamaua]] became the major Japanese bases in New Guinea.

The naval [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea]] in March 1943<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/remembering1942/bismark/|title=Battle of the Bismarck Sea, 2-4 March 1943|work=awm.gov.au}}</ref> was fought over the Japanese attempt to reinforce Lae with troops sent by sea from [[Rabaul]], an attempt foiled by sustained Allied attack on the Japanese troop transports. In mid-1943, after defeats in the [[Kokoda Track campaign]], the [[Battle of Buna–Gona]] and the [[Battle of Wau]], the Japanese retreated to Lae and Salamaua. However, the [[Salamaua–Lae campaign]] involved many weeks of fierce fighting, before the town fell to the Allies on 16 September.

In 1971 the Australian Colonial Administration established the first properly constituted Local Government of Lae town and in 1972 Lae was proclaimed a city.<ref name="Morobe Province">{{cite web|url=http://morobepng.com/id13.html|title=Lae City Council|work=morobepng.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219071736/http://morobepng.com/id13.html|archive-date=19 February 2015}}</ref> Lae's development after the war is directly linked to the development of the highlands. [[Coffee]] and [[tea]] were being grown and a port was needed. Later priority was given on road access, and the Highlands Highway came into existence. The mineral boom occurred in the 1980s and 1990s.

Lae is located on the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]] and geologic instability has produced numerous [[fault (geology)|faults]], resulting in earthquakes.<ref>{{cite web|last=USGS |title=Seismic Hazard Map |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/png/seismicity.php |access-date=28 February 2014  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728225225/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/png/seismicity.php |archive-date=28 July 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Earthquake Track|title=Recent Earthquake Near New Guinea, Papua New Guinea|url=http://earthquaketrack.com/r/new-guinea-papua-new-guinea/recent|access-date=28 February 2014}}</ref>

Lae sits between the larger [[Indo-Australian Plate]] and the [[Pacific Plate]] on the [[South Bismarck Plate]] in the Ramu-Markham Fault Zone where the New Guinea Highlands Deforming Zone and South Bismarck [[tectonic plates]] are converging at up to 50&nbsp;mm/yr.

The Ramu-Markham Fault Zone, which follows the northern edge of the Markham Valley, is the active plate boundary between the South Bismarck Plate and [[Terranes|tectonostratigraphic terranes]] within the New Guinea Highlands Deforming Zone. The Ramu-Markham Fault Zone has generated large thrust earthquakes (e.g. 6 April 1999 MW 6.4, 16&nbsp;km North of Lae, near Hobu, and 22 November 2007 MW 6.8, 110&nbsp;km North of Lae).

Mount Lunaman and the Lae urban area have been the subject of several tectonic studies relating to plate shift.<ref name="Crook Pages 105–118">{{cite journal|last=Crook|first=Keith A.W|title=Quaternary uplift rates at a plate boundary, Lae urban area, Papua New Guinea|journal=Tectonophysics|date=10 June 1989|volume=163|issue=1,2|pages=105–118|doi=10.1016/0040-1951(89)90121-2|bibcode=1989Tectp.163..105C}}</ref>

Mount Lunaman was an important landmark for both Japanese and the Allies:
:"The men of the South Australian battalion hammered and sawed vigorously at the top of the terrace. They were reconstructing, with captured Japanese tools, the skeleton of the cottage formerly used as the Japanese commander's sanctum. A hole beneath the door led by a tunnel to a labyrinth of passages and apertures which honeycombed Mount Lunaman".<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Semmler|editor-first=Clement|title=The war dispatches of Kenneth Slessor, official Australian correspondent, 1940–1944|year=1987|publisher=University of Queensland Press|location=St. Lucia, Qld., Australia|isbn=978-0-7022-2076-0|page=382|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AmoNAAAAIAAJ&q=Mount+Lunamen|edition=1. publ.}}</ref>

After the war it was believed that Mount Lunaman contained the remains of many Japanese soldiers who defended Lae using tunnels:
[[File:Japanese tunnel in Mt. Lunaman in Chinatown.jpg|thumb|Still extant Japanese World War II [[Tunnel warfare|tunnel]] in Mt Lunaman. Looking out towards Chinatown.]]
:A Japanese tomb believed to contain bodies of hundreds of Lae defenders was bought by two South Australian men for 1 pound. The tomb lies under Mount Lunaman which is said to house a hospital and when the Japanese in [[Tunnel warfare|tunnels]] refused to surrender to the Australian [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]] and [[9th Division (Australia)|9th Division]] troops in 1943 all entrances were sealed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article35768821 |title=Odd Deal at Lae Sales|newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide|date=26 November 1946|page=7|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> In a 1971 NHK interview with the Japanese Army commander of Lae, he stated that the tunnels in the hill were only ever used for storage, and the Army had used the Lutheran Malahang Hospital some 10&nbsp;km north of the town.

== Government ==
The Lae City Council is also known as Lae Urban Local-Level Government. It is an Urban Municipal Authority, responsible for the policy decisions, management and administration of the city, by way of providing the municipal services to the residents of the city.<ref name="Morobe Province"/>

=== Roads ===

The Lae City has 137 kilometers of roads, which the National Government is responsible for the maintenance of the Independence Drive, the Markham Road, and the Milford Haven Road, while the Lae City Council maintains the rest of the roads in the city. Due to lack of funding, almost all the roads have deteriorated over the years.<ref name="Morobe Province"/>

=== Electricity ===
In recent years PNG, including Lae [https://postcourier.com.pg/blackouts-affecting-businesses-in-lae-madang/] has been experiencing problems with electricity supply.
