'''Temuco''' ({{IPA|es|teˈmuko}}) is a [[List of cities in Chile|city]] and [[Communes of Chile|commune]], [[capital (political)|capital]] of the [[Cautín Province]] and of the [[Araucanía Region]] in southern [[Chile]]. The city is located {{convert|670|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]]. The city grew out from a fort of the same name established in 1881 during [[Occupation of Araucanía|Chile's invasion of Araucanía]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Bengoa |first=José |author-link=José Bengoa |title=Historia del pueblo mapuche: Siglos XIX y XX |year=2000 |edition=Seventh |publisher=[[LOM Ediciones]] |isbn=956-282-232-X|pages=280–281}}</ref> Temuco lies in the middle of the historic [[Araucanía (historic region)|Araucanía]], a traditional land of the indigenous [[Mapuche]].

Temuco's central place in Araucanía with easy access to the Andean valleys, lakes and coastal areas makes it a hub for tourism, agricultural, livestock and forestry operations as well as a communication and trade centre for the numerous small towns of Araucanía. Temuco has recently been regarded as a university city as it houses two large universities: [[University of the Frontier]] and [[Temuco Catholic University]]. Nobel laureates [[Gabriela Mistral]] and [[Pablo Neruda]] both lived in Temuco for some time.

==Etymology==
[[File:Arrayan luma apiculata.jpg|thumb|left|Luma apiculata]]
The word Temuco comes from the [[Mapudungun]] language, meaning "temu water"; "''temu''" is the common name of two native trees of the family Myrtaceae, ''[[Luma apiculata]]'' (also known as arrayán in Spanish) and ''[[Blepharocalyx cruckshanksii]]''. Both species are characterized by their orange-reddish bark and by having aromatic fruits and leaves which are commonly used by the [[Mapuche]] for medicinal purposes. While ''Blepharocalyx cruckschankii'' is endangered, ''Luma apiculata'' is relatively common and in Temuco it is possible to see it in the Cerro Ñielol Natural Monument (in its natural state) as well as in city gardens and sidewalks. The blend between the words "''temu''" and "''co''" (water), probably reflects the fact that these trees frequently grow beside water bodies.

==History==
{{see also|Mapuche uprising of 1881}}
The area around Temuco began to be settled by non-indigenous Chileans in the mid-1870s, when for example [[Labranza]] began to be settled.<ref>Gobierno Regional de la Araucanía (GORE). 2011. Labranza. Huellas en el camino. Historia de mi localidad.

The city was founded by Chilean army on February 24, 1881, as a fort during the [[Occupation of the Araucanía]]. [[Manuel Recabarren]], in charge of the project, named the place Fuerte (Fort) Recabarren.

Formed as a military encampment, Temuco had in its origins the attributes of a camp, and a year after its founding, the first major streets started to form in the downtown area.

On April 15, 1888, the first city officers were elected including the first mayor José del Rosario Muñoz. The city grew quickly; a census in 1895 indicated a population of 7,708 people, and when Cautin was declared a province, Temuco became its capital, with its population by that time of 16,037 people.

Chilean poetry has deep roots in Temuco. Nobel laureates [[Gabriela Mistral]] and [[Pablo Neruda]] (Neftalí Reyes) both lived in Temuco. Mistral was the principal of an all-girls school where Neruda would visit her and show her his first verses when he was around 15 years old.

In 2010 Temuco was affected by the [[2010 Chile earthquake|earthquake on February 27]] centered {{convert|400|km|abbr=on}} to the north. It was one of the most affected regions of Chile besides Santiago, Concepcion, Valparaíso and others.{{Clarify |date=February 2011}} The earthquake registered 8.8 M<sub>w</sub> on the [[moment magnitude scale]]. Though landlocked Temuco avoided the tsunamis the earthquake caused, many very strong aftershocks throughout the country followed, including a 7.1 M<sub>W</sub> earthquake {{convert|70|km|0|abbr=on}} northwest of the city.<ref name="USGS">

==Demographics==

According to the 2017 [[census]] by the [[National Statistics Institute (Chile)|National Statistics Institute]] (''INE''), Temuco had a communal population of 282,415 (134,289 men and 148,126 women). Of these, 263,165 (93.2%) lived in [[urban area]]s and 19,250 (6.8%) in [[rural area]]s. The population grew by 15.11% (37,068 persons) between the 2002 and 2017 censuses.<ref name="INE"/> The ''INE'' projected the 2024 population to be 309,696,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bcn.cl/siit/reportescomunales/comunas_v.html?anno=2024&idcom=9101|title=Reporte Comunal 2024: Temuco|work=[[Library of the National Congress of Chile]]|access-date=20 October 2024|language=es}}</ref> The [[Greater Temuco]] [[metropolitan area]], including the neighbouring commune of [[Padre Las Casas, Chile|Padre Las Casas]], has a population of 410,520 people, which makes it the second largest city south of Santiago (behind [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]]), and the sixth largest in the country.<ref name=INE/> One of the distinctive features of Temuco is the strong presence of the [[Mapuche]] culture, who make up 23.1% of the population in the Temuco commune, and numerous German immigrant colonies (9.8%). Temuco proper has a population of 227,086.{{When|date=February 2011}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The locals are called ''temuquenses''. The inhabitants have diverse origins. Temuco has a high percentage of people of [[Basque people|Basque]] ancestry, as well as [[Castilian people|Castilian]] and other [[Spaniards|Spanish]] nationalities. There is a substantial indigenous component, mainly [[Mapuche]], accounting for 13% of the population of Temuco, which makes it the city of [[Chile]] with the largest indigenous presence.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} 
There is also a large percentage of ''temuquences'' directly descended from [[European emigration|European immigrants]], many of whom arrived during 1883–1901 after the pacification of [[Araucanía (historic region)|Araucanía]]. The main European sources are Switzerland, Spain, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. Others, less numerous and from many other parts of Europe such as the Netherlands, Austria, [[Croatia]], [[Armenia]], Greece, Portugal, etc., arrived after that first migration, especially during the World Wars. During the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1930s), a large percentage of [[Aragonese people|Aragonese]], [[Asturians]], [[Catalan people|Catalans]], [[Galicians]], [[Navarrese]] and [[Basques]] reached a significant number of immigrants from Europe (mainly Spain).

There are also small communities of Jews, from Russia, Poland, [[North Macedonia|Macedonia]], Hungary, as well as [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] Europe in general, and [[Arabs]], from [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]. This immigration from Europe and, to a lesser extent, Jewish and Arabic areas helps to explain the various clubs, schools, and sections of the city of Temuco. There are [[East Asia]]n colonies of Chinese, Japanese and Koreans in Temuco, dating back to the end of the [[Korean War]] in the 1950s when thousands of Korean refugees settled through U.N. relocation programs to Chile.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Geography==
[[File:Llaima eruption1.jpg|thumb|300px|Llaima volcano located in the Andes as seen from Temuco valley]]

Temuco is located in a valley in the center-south of Chile, equidistant between the Pacific Ocean to the west and the [[Andes]] to the east. [[Geomorphology|Morphologically]], the city placement corresponds to [[Cautín River]]-originated fluvial land masses that developed in a crushed form between two hills, Ñielol (350m) and Conunhueno (360m).

== Economy and environment ==

The city is surrounded by a landscape typical to central-southern Chile, consisting mostly of plantations of exotic species used in forestry along with prairies. The original ecosystem of the area consisting in temperate forest is present mostly in the Ñielol hill. Given that burning wood is the primary source of heat during the cold months in Temuco, air pollution is a recurrent problem during autumn and winter. As a consequence, Air quality in Temuco is the third lowest in Chile.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/nacional/2015/02/680-616914-9-ranking-de-ciudades-contaminadas-coyhaique-y-osorno-lideran-malos-indices.shtml|title=News report February 2015|access-date=16 June 2016|archive-date=1 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701101935/http://www.latercera.com/noticia/nacional/2015/02/680-616914-9-ranking-de-ciudades-contaminadas-coyhaique-y-osorno-lideran-malos-indices.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://santiagotimes.cl/2013/06/13/air-pollution-worsens-in-southern-chilean-city-of-temuco/|title=Air pollution worsens in southern Chilean city of Temuco|access-date=20 September 2016|archive-date=22 April 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220422205254/https://santiagotimes.cl/2013/06/13/air-pollution-worsens-in-southern-chilean-city-of-temuco/|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Climate ==
Climatologically, Temuco lies at the border of Chile's central valley Mediterranean region, albeit with a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Csb''). Through the year, cyclonic and anticyclonic influences alternate, with a distinct drier summer period (although not as dry as Santiago or other central valley cities, receiving just enough precipitation to avoid a Mediterranean climate classification). Its mean annual temperature is {{convert|13|°C|0|abbr=on}}, with highest median during the warmest month of {{convert|23.5|°C|0|abbr=on}} and lowest median during the coldest month of {{convert|3.5|°C|0|abbr=on}} (Ciren-Corfo, 1992). Annual mean rain during 1961-1990 (Dirección Meteorológica de Chile, 1991) was {{convert|1157|mm|in|1}} (Capelli de Steffens et al., 1997).

[[Buses]] and [[Share taxi|collective taxis]] are the most popular modes of mass transit. The bus fare is CLP$150 for students and $450 for adults; the ''colectivos'' charge $500 ($650 at night). {{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

[[La Araucanía Airport]] is commercial air terminal for Temuco located to the south of the city, near the town of [[Freire, Chile|Freire]], about 20 minutes south of Temuco.

The [[train|railroad]] connects Temuco with Victoria to the north and points in between.

Temuco does not have a [[rapid transit]] rail system.

Long-haul buses run from the Terminal Rodoviario de la Araucania,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/chile/the-lakes-district/temuco/transport/transportation-travel-services/terminal-rodoviario | title=Sur Chico travel | access-date=26 September 2015 | archive-date=27 September 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927223105/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/chile/the-lakes-district/temuco/transport/transportation-travel-services/terminal-rodoviario | url-status=live }}</ref> at the northern approach to town.

Private transport by car is commonly used which causes traffic congestion at peak hours.

The recent proliferation of bike lanes has placed transportation by bicycle as an emerging trend. By 2017, {{cvt|35|km}} of bike lanes are expected to be operative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masmunicipios.cl/noticias/araucania/temuco/la-araucania-contara-con-35-kilometros-de-ciclovias-para-el-ano-2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191124221538/www.masmunicipios.cl/noticias/araucania/temuco/la-araucania-contara-con-35-kilometros-de-ciclovias-para-el-ano-2017|archive-date=2019-11-24|title=LA ARAUCANÍA CONTARÁ CON 35 KILÓMETROS DE CICLOVÍAS PARA EL AÑO 2017}}</ref>

==Important places==
* '''Cerro Ñielol'''
The Ñielol Hill houses the original temperate forest at this latitude in southern Chile as it was before the Spanish people colonised it. Currently, it has the status of natural monument and as such, it is a protected area. It has also a special meaning for the [[Mapuche]] people living in the Region, housing near the top a ceremonial area called La Patagua. We can also find a restaurant at the top of the Hill and a viewpoint of the east side of the city and Padre Las Casas, across the river. It is easily accessed by foot or car. The [[Southern Andean Volcano Observatory]] has its office there.

* '''Central market'''
The central market is one of the best places to get Mapuche crafts. It has a meat market and shops selling woodcrafts, artifacts, wool knits, and similar goods. A fire has recently affected its structure. Reconstruction is planned, but the original market is currently closed.

* '''Feria Pinto'''
One of the most traditional places in the city. Fresh fruits and vegetables are sold here in a daily basis. People from the city and from rural nearby towns come here for trade.
[[File:2019-09-13 Friday 18.23.17 UTC-3 Malmus Mansion (Temuco).jpg|thumb|Campus Menchaca Lira Campus of [[Temuco Catholic University]], located in Alemania Avenue.]]
* '''Alemania Avenue'''
Is the principal artery in Temuco. Here we can find The Araucaria Museum building (19th century Chilean style); the Menchaca Lira Campus of Art Building (a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] Style building, recently restored); The English Alley, where we can find the [[Red Cross]] Building and not long ago a blue house which was dismantled to be rebuilt elsewhere (as a Heritage recovery project by the school of architecture of a known University of Temuco), both [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] styled.

Recently, Alemania Av. has become an important commercial centre. Several restaurants, night clubs, pubs, bistros, pharmacies, boutiques, banks, supermarkets and two shopping malls have been opened there. There is also a Casino and a five stars hotel in the same avenue.

* '''Anibal Pinto Square'''
The core of Downtown Temuco is the Main Square Anibal Pinto. Temuco's Main Square is the only one in [[Chile]] that was not built with a water fountain in its centre; an art gallery was built in 1981 as part of a total renewal. Compared to other main squares of southern Chile, Temuco's looks very modern. It was named one of Chile's most beautiful plazas.
It is a tradition, in all [[Creole peoples|creole]] cities in Chile, that some specific buildings must be in front of the main square; in Temuco, this tradition has been broken. Main Squares are supposed to be surrounded by: a [[Cathedral]] (which is in front of Temuco's main square, as traditionally), the [[Municipality]] (which also, is located in front of the square), a [[Theatre]] (there used to be a film theatre in front of it), a [[Fire Station]] (there is not a fire station in front of the square, as it should), a [[School]] (there is no school in front of the main square), and a [[Bank]] (there are four banks around the main square).
