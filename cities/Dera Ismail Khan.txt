==Etymology==
In the local language, the word ''ḍerā'' means "tent, encampment", and is commonly found in the name of towns in the [[Indus Valley]] such as [[Dera Ghazi Khan]] and [[Dera Bugti]]. It is named after [[Dodai tribe|Dodai]] mercenary Ismail Khan, son of [[Malik Sohrab Dodai]], who founded the town.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://waseb.org/2010/04/20/baloch-tribes-of-the-saraiki-waseb-by-farooq-miana/|title=Baloch tribes of the Saraiki Waseb – by Farooq Miana|date=April 20, 2010}}</ref> "Dera Ismail Khan" so it means "Camp of Ismail Khan."

===Foundation===

====Early history====
[[File:Pakistan_Dera_Ismail_Khan_map.svg|thumb|Map of D. I. Khan]]
The region around Dera Ismail Khan has been inhabited for millennia, as evidenced by the nearby site of [[Rehman Dheri]] — a [[Indus Valley civilisation|pre-Harappan]] archaeological site dating back from 3300 BCE.<ref>Saira Naseem, Zakirullah Jan (2016), [https://web.archive.org/web/20220211131146/http://journals.uop.edu.pk/papers/13.%20The%20Emerging%20Tochi%20Gomal%20191-199.pdf The Emerging Tochi-Gomal Cultural Phase in the Gomal Plain, Northwest Pakistan.] Ancient Pakistan, Vol. XXVII (2016) 191</ref> In the seventh century, the city had a large population of Brahmins and Buddhists.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meister |first1=Michael W. |title=Temples of the Indus: Studies in the Hindu Architecture of Ancient Pakistan |date=26 July 2010 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-19011-5 |page=12 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1N95DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA12 |language=en}}</ref>

====Medieval history====
D. I. Khan is located in the historical [[Derajat]] region, which was established in the 15th century, when [[Baloch people]] were invited to settle the region by Shah Husayn, of the [[Langah Sultanate]] of [[Multan]]. 

Baloch settlers were assimilated through the, later waves of [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] settlement, although villagers along the alluvial plains are typically Baloch or [[Jat]].<ref name="tolbort"/> 

Dera Ismail Khan region was part of [[Multan Subah]] of Mughal Empire, though D. I Khan never attained a station of great power or importance before the British period. D. I. Khan grew prosperous as a trading centre for [[Kochi people|Powindah]] nomads, during Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire.

D. I. Khan was ruled by nine generations of Baloch leaders descended directly from Ismail Khan. The last, Nusrat Khan, was removed from power after the city was captured by [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] in 1750. In 1794, the city was granted to Nawab Muhammad Khan Sadozai by [[Shahzada Kamran Durrani]].<ref name="tolbort">{{cite book |last1=Tolbort |first1=T |title=The District of Dera Ismail Khan, Trans-Indus |date=1871 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RVQOAAAAQAAJ&q=dera+ismail+khan |access-date=12 December 2017}}</ref>

====Re establishment of the city====
The original town was swept away by flooding on the Indus River in 1823. The present city was founded by Nawab Sher Muhammad Khan of the [[Sadduzai|Saddozai clan]] in 1825, and now stands four miles (6&nbsp; km) away from the permanent channel of the river, atop a small plateau.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Dera Ismail Khan |volume=8 |page=64}}</ref> Nawab Sadozai took into consideration the opinions of Diwan Lakhi Mal and Tej Bhan Nandwani for the city's reconstruction.<ref name=c2d/> Architects were brought in from Punjab, who designed a city where Hindus would live south of the city center and Muslims north of it.<ref name=c2d/> 

Four bazaars were laid in each of the cardinal directions, with all four converging in the town's central ''[[Chowgalla]]''.<ref name="c2d" /> The rebuilt city contained a large bazaar for Afghan traders, and the city prospered from trade via the [[Gomal Pass]].<ref name="DIKC" /> An eight foot mud wall with nine gates was built around the city during this time as well,<ref name="c2d" /> some of which such as the ''Kaneran Wala'' and ''Sakki'' survive until today. All existing buildings date from no earlier than the 19th century.<ref name="IGI269">[https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V11_275.gif Dera Ismail Khān Town – Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 11, p. 269]. Dsal.uchicago.edu. Retrieved on 2012-06-01.</ref>

===Sikh rule (1821–1849)===
D. I. Khan remained under Sadozai rule from the nearby town of [[Mankera]] until it was annexed by Bhatti Jatsikh ruler Maharaja [[Nau Nihal Singh]] of the [[Sikh Empire]] in 1836.<ref name=c2d>{{cite web |title=Dera Ismail Khan - An Overview of History and Indigenous People |url=http://c2d.org.pk/index.php/component/phocadownload/category/4-heritage-resource-kit-for-community-english?download=3:2-dera-ismail-khan-an-overview-of-the-history-ingigenous-peoples |access-date=12 December 2017}}</ref> Diwan Lakhi Mal appointed city's ''Kardar'' ruler, though the Nawabs of the city from the Durrani order were allowed to maintain their title and some income.<ref name=c2d/> The city suffered under punitive taxes that lead to frequent complaints in the Sikh ''Darbar'' at Lahore, resulting in several changes of ''Kardar''.<ref name=c2d/>

=== Colonial British India era ===
D. I. Khan's first deputy commissioner under [[British Indian Empire]] was General Henry Charles Van Cortland, who arrived in February 1848, before departing later that year to quell a revolt in nearby [[Multan]]. Following the defeat of rebels at Multan, Lieutenant Butler was made the next deputy commissioner of D. I. Khan and [[Bannu]].<ref name="c2d"/> Under his rule, city's infrastructure and colonial administration system were established in which top posts were exclusively occupied by the British.<ref name="c2d"/> The city was on the edge of the Tribal Areas — lands that were frequently in rebellion against British Indian Empire. The town did not rise up in revolt against British Indian Empire during the 1857 [[Sepoy Mutiny]].<ref name=c2d/> In 1861, D. I. Khan was made into the Divisional Capital of the new [[Dera Ismail Khan Division]]: analogous to a British county.<ref name="c2d"/>

The municipality was constituted in 1867, while the [[Dera Ismail Khan Cantonment]] was established in 1894.<ref name="DIKC">{{cite web |title=Dera Ismail Khan Cantonment |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/pakistan/cantt-dera-ismail-khan.htm |publisher=Global Security |access-date=12 December 2017}}</ref> By 1881 the city's population was 22,164. The military [[cantonment]] area, which lies southeast of the town, had an area of {{convert|44|sqmi|km2}}, excluding the portion known as Fort Akalgarh on the northwest side. 

The Dera Ismail Brigade had its winter headquarters at Dera Ismail Khan, and the garrison consisted of a mountain battery, a regiment of Native cavalry, and three regiments of Native infantry. Detachments from these regiments helped to garrison the outposts of Drazinda, Jandola, and Jatta. The "Civil Lines" neighborhood was built to the south.<ref name="IGI269" />

The town possessed a civil hospital; its chief educational institutions were two aided Anglo-vernacular high schools, one maintained by the Church Missionary Society and the other by the Bharatri Sabha, and an Anglo-vernacular middle school maintained by the municipality.<ref name="IGI269"/>

According to the 1901 census, the population of Dera Ismail Khan was 31,737, of whom 18,662 were Muslims, 11,486 Hindus, and 1,420 Sikhs. Of the total, 3,450 lived in the cantonment.<ref>[https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V11_274.gif Dera Ismail Khān Town – Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 11, p. 268]. Dsal.uchicago.edu. Retrieved on 2012-06-01.</ref> 

The predominantly Muslim population (which accounted for more than 80 % of the local population of Dera Ismail Khan) supported the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and the [[Pakistan Movement]]. After the [[Partition of India]] and independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s migrated to India, while the [[Muslim]] migrants from India settled in Dera Ismail Khan. In India, Model Town, Vijay Nagar and [[Derawal Nagar]] colony in [[Delhi]] absorbed many Hindu former residents of D. I. Khan.<ref name="The Tribune - Derawal Nagar">{{cite web |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030319/ncr1.htm |title=Colonies, posh and model in name only! |publisher=NCR Tribune |access-date=2007-12-16}}</ref>

=== After Independence of 1947 ===
Following an influx of refugees following the 1979 [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], D. I. Khan's population tripled.<ref name="DIKC"/>
