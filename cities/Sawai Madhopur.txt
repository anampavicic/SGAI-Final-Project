== Etymology ==
Sawai Madhopur is named after [[Maharaja]] [[Madho Singh I|Sawai Madho Singh I]] (born 20 May 1728 – March 5, 1768) (Reign: {{circa|1750|1768}}), the ruler of [[Kingdom of Amber|Amer]], who established the city in 1763. In [[Sanskrit]], the term "''pur''" (or "''pura''") is often employed to denote a [[city]] or [[town]]. "''Sawai Madhopur''" can be interpreted as "''The City of Sawai Madho''" or "''Sawai Madho's City''," serving as a tribute to [[Madho Singh I|Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh I]], the founder of the city.

== History ==
The early history of Sawai Madhopur can be associated with Ranthambore Fort.

In 1226, the fort was captured by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] under the command of [[Iltutmish|Sultan Iltutmish]]. It remained under the control of the Delhi Sultanate until the mid-14th century. [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khilji]], another ruler of the Delhi Sultanate, besieged and captured the fort in 1301 after a fierce battle with the Chauhan king Rao [[Hammiradeva|Hammir Dev]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hooja |first=Rima |title=A History of Rajasthan |date=2006 |publisher=[[Rupa Publications]] |isbn=9788129108906}}</ref> The fort was further fortified and expanded during this period.

=== [[Kingdom of Mewar|Mewar Kingdom]] (14th to 16th Century) ===

=== [[Mughal era]] (16th to 18th Century) ===
In the 16th century, Ranthambore Fort came under [[Mughal Empire|Mughal rule]]. Emperors [[Akbar]] and [[Aurangzeb]], in particular, recognized its strategic importance.

==Geography==
Sawai Madhopur is located in the southeastern part of the state of [[Rajasthan]], India.

The city is situated at the junction of the [[Aravalli Range|Aravalli]] and [[Vindhya Range|Vindhya]] hill ranges. The city is approximately {{convert|121|km|mi}} southeast of the city of [[Jaipur]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2013-11-13 |title=Rajasthan gears up for battle royale in Sawai Madhopur |url=https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rajasthan-gears-up-for-battle-royale-in-sawai-madhopur-1227603.html |access-date=2024-01-05 |website=Firstpost |language=en}}</ref>

==Climate==
Sawai Madhopur experiences a semi-arid climate characterized by distinct seasons. Summers, lasting from March to June, bring extremely high temperatures, often exceeding 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), due to prevailing dry and arid conditions. The peak heat occurs in May and June, reaching up to 47&nbsp;°C (120&nbsp;°F). Winters, spanning December to February, are relatively mild with daytime temperatures ranging from 8 to 25 degrees Celsius (46 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by cool nights.

The monsoon season, lasting from July to October, provides relief from the intense summer heat with rain showers. Although the monsoon in Rajasthan is generally less intense than in other parts of India, it is crucial for sustaining agricultural activities, including the cultivation of crops like guava. Post-monsoon months (October to November) mark a transitional period as temperatures gradually decrease, leading to more pleasant weather.

The average annual rainfall in Sawai Madhopur is 800&nbsp;mm, contributing significantly to the region's ecology. Notably, the monsoon season prompts the closure of Ranthambore National Park. During the summer, the average humidity ranges from 10 to 15 percent, while the rainy season sees an increase to 60 percent. The ideal tourist season in Sawai Madhopur is from October to November and February to April, when the weather is more accommodating for outdoor activities and exploration.{{Weather box
