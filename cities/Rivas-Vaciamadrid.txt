'''Rivas-Vaciamadrid''' ({{IPA|es|ˈriβas βaθjamaˈðɾið|lang}}) is the 15th most populated city in the [[Community of Madrid]], [[Spain]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ine.es/jaxiT3/Datos.htm?t=2881 |title=Cifras oficiales de población resultantes de la revisión del Padrón municipal a 1 de enero |access-date=15 January 2020 |work=[[INE (Spain)|INE]] |language=es |year=2019}}</ref> It belongs to the [[Madrid metropolitan area]] and is located just 15&nbsp;km from central [[Madrid]], to the south-east. In the southern part of the municipality, the Manzanares river flows into the Jarama, which is part of the [[:es:Parque regional del Sureste|Lower Manzanares and Jarama Rivers Regional Park]]. Almost three quarters of the municipality form part of the park, making it an important ecological centre with numerous lakes and various species of wildlife and fauna.

It has been one of the fastest-growing municipalities in Spain in recent years, growing from 500 inhabitants in the 1980s to its current figure of 100,000. It is bordered to the north by [[Madrid]] and [[San Fernando de Henares]], to the south by [[Arganda del Rey]] and [[San Martín de la Vega]], to the east by [[Mejorada del Campo]] and [[Velilla de San Antonio]], and to the west by Getafe and Madrid (the district of Villa de Vallecas.)

Rivas-Vaciamadrid municipality has the fourth lowest rate of population in risk of poverty, among municipalities with more than 50,000 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.eleconomista.es/economia/noticias/7005902/09/15/Que-municipios-espanoles-tienen-las-mayores-tasas-de-riesgo-de-pobreza.html |title=¿Qué municipios españoles tienen las mayores tasas de riesgo de pobreza? |date=16 September 2015 |access-date=15 January 2020 |newspaper=[[Eleconomista.es]] |language=es |publisher=Editorial Ecoprensa}}</ref> It is the most populated city in Spain governed by [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]].

==History==
In 1845, the area of Vaciamadrid, previously part of the village of [[Vallecas]], was joined to the town of Rivas, with the unified municipality originally called Ribas de Jarama.

The area was devastated during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and had to be rebuilt in the post-civil war period. In 1954 the name was changed to its current title. At the end of the 1980s the area was designated as a future nucleus for new urbanisation projects under a project titled Rivas-Urbanizaciones (Rivas-Urbanisations). The first developments were those in the current districts of Pablo Iglesias and Covibar.

In 2004 the municipal boundary with the city of [[Madrid]] was altered. This involved the transfer of areas known as Covibar-Madrid to Rivas-Vaciamadrid. In exchange, some uninhabited areas in Los Berrocales district were transferred to the [[Vicálvaro]] district of Madrid in order to allow the construction of a new housing project.

==Local politics==
[[File:Elecciones Rivas-Vaciamadrid.png|thumb|Municipal elections results since 1979.]]
[[File:Concejales Rivas 2023.svg|thumb|Current number of city councillors by party (2023–2027).]]
Rivas-Vaciamadrid has always been governed by left-wing parties, mostly [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]], that has remained uninterruptedly in power since 1991. The current mayor is Pedro del Cura, who took office in 2014 after José Masa's resignation, and was re-elected in 2015. However, the [[Spanish municipal elections, 2015|2015 election]] gave the worst result to United Left (24.5%) since its creation in 1986, due to the big support that the [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]]-linked candidacy ''Rivas Puede'' (Spanish for ''Rivas Can'') obtained (23.3%).
