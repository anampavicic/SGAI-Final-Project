==Geography==
Aomori is located in central Aomori Prefecture, the northernmost prefecture of [[Honshu]]. It is located in the northeastern part of the Tsugaru region, which refers to the western half of the prefecture, and is centered on Aomori Plain, facing Aomori Bay, a branch bay of [[Mutsu Bay]], to the north, and the [[Hakkōda Mountains|Hakkōda]] and Higashidake Mountains, which are the northern end of the [[Ōu Mountains]] to the south to the east. Among other smaller rivers, the city has two large rivers flowing through it, the [[Komagome River]] and its tributary, the Arakawa River. Parts of the city in the southeast are within the borders of [[Towada-Hachimantai National Park]] and is a tourist destination throughout the four seasons. In the northeast is [[Asamushi-Natsudomari Prefectural Natural Park]]. There are many [[onsen|hot springs]] in the city, including [[Sukayu Onsen]] at the foot of Mt. Hakkōda and [[Asamushi Onsen]] on the coast.

===Climate===
Like most of the Tōhoku region, Aomori has a humid temperate climate with warm summers, and cold, though not extreme, winters. The city has a cold, [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfa'') closely bordering the [[Humid subtropical climate|Humid Subtropical climate]] (Köppen ''Cfa'') using the {{cvt|0.0|°C}} isotherm with both January and February monthly averages being too cold to be of the latter, characterized by warm, short summers and long, cold winters with heavy snowfall. The average annual temperature in Aomori is {{cvt|10.7|°C}}. The average annual rainfall is {{cvt|1285|mm|in|sp=us}} with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around {{cvt|23.5|°C}}, and lowest in January, at around {{cvt|-2.1|°C}}.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://en.climate-data.org/asia/japan/aomori/aomori-5405/ |title=Aomori climate data |access-date=24 April 2020 |archive-date=12 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112024222/https://en.climate-data.org/asia/japan/aomori/aomori-5405/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Aomori and the surrounding areas are known for having the [[Snowfall#Records|heaviest snowfall]] in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Ogura |first2=Jon|last2= Jensen|first1=Junko |date=2019-02-25 |title=Aomori, Japan: World's snowiest city? |url=https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/aomori-japan-snowiest-cities/index.html |access-date=2024-06-29 |website=CNN |language=en}}</ref> In February 1945, the city recorded a maximum snow cover of {{cvt|209|cm|in|sp=us}}, but the record low of {{cvt|&minus;24.7|C|0}} was recorded 14 years earlier. In contrast, [[Sapporo]]'s heaviest snowfall which occurred in 1939 was {{cvt|164|cm|in|sp=us}}, and [[Wakkanai, Hokkaido|Wakkanai]] which is located further north has recorded similar maxima. The particularly heavy snow is caused by several winds that collide around the city and make the air rise and cool, resulting in quick, thick cloud formation followed by intense [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]].

In summer, a cool wind called "Yamase" often blows from the east, which sometimes results in abnormally cool weather and poor harvests. Additionally, thick fogs from the [[Oyashio Current]] are often observed in mountainous areas in the summer. Due to this fog, flights to [[Aomori Airport]] are often cancelled.<ref>{{cite web |author=Hiroshi Takai |title=Characteristics of the Yamase Winds over Oceans around Japan Observed by the Scatterometer-Derived Ocean Surface Vector Winds |url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jmsj/84/2/84_2_365/_pdf/-char/en |work=Journal of the Meteorological Society of Japan |pages=365–373 |year=2006 |access-date=17 July 2020 |archive-date=17 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200717053857/https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jmsj/84/2/84_2_365/_pdf/-char/en |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[file:Wiki-utou2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rhinoceros auklet]] (ウトウ)]]
The original name of the Aomori was Utō, named for the {{Nihongo|[[Rhinoceros auklet]]|ウトウ}}, a seabird that is closely related to the [[puffin]]. In 1626 the name was  changed to {{Nihongo||青森|Aomori|extra2="blue forest"}}, but this was not fully embraced until 1783.<ref name="「青森」地名伝承の誤解＝４１"/>

==History==
[[File:SannaiMaruyama.jpg|thumb|Sannai-Maruyama Site]]
''Aomori'' literally means blue forest, although it could possibly be translated as "[[Distinguishing blue from green in language#Japanese|green]] forest". The name is generally considered to refer to a small forest on a hill which existed near the town. This forest was often used by fishermen as a landmark. A different theory suggests the name might have been derived from the [[Ainu language]].{{cn|date=July 2024}}

The area has been settled extensively since prehistoric times, and numerous [[Jōmon period]] sites have been found by archaeologists, the most famous being the [[Sannai-Maruyama Site]] located just southwest of the city center dating to 5500–4000&nbsp;BC, and the [[Komakino Site]] slightly farther south dating to around 4000&nbsp;BC. The large scale of these settlements revolutionized theories on Jōmon period civilization. During the [[Heian period]], the area was part of the holdings of the [[Northern Fujiwara]] clan, but remained inhabited by the [[Emishi]] people well into the historic period. After the fall of the Northern Fujiwara in the [[Kamakura period]], the territory was part of the domain assigned to the [[Nambu clan]], and into the [[Sengoku period]], it came under the control of the rival [[Tsugaru clan]], whose main castle was located in [[Namioka, Aomori|Namioka]]. After the start of the [[Edo period]], what would become the core of present-day Aomori was a minor port settlement in the [[Hirosaki Domain]] called {{Nihongo|Utō|善知鳥村|Utō-mura}}. The town was rebuilt in 1626 under orders of the ''[[daimyō]]'', [[Tsugaru Nobuhira]] and renamed "Aomori", but this name did not come into common use until after 1783; however, the historical accuracy of this claim is debated since there is no written material from the time to definitively connect Utō to Aomori. Some evidence even claims that Aomori and Utō co-existed in different parts of the city in its current state. It was not until 1909 that a local scholar claimed that the village of Utō became Aomori.<ref name="「青森」地名伝承の誤解＝４１">{{cite web |title=「青森」地名伝承の誤解＝４１ |url=http://www.mutusinpou.co.jp/%E6%B4%A5%E8%BB%BD%E3%81%AE%E8%A1%97%E3%81%A8%E9%A2%A8%E6%99%AF/2016/02/39973.html |language=ja |date=1 February 2016 |access-date=27 November 2019 |archive-date=20 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200920012047/http://www.mutusinpou.co.jp/%E6%B4%A5%E8%BB%BD%E3%81%AE%E8%A1%97%E3%81%A8%E9%A2%A8%E6%99%AF/2016/02/39973.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

After the [[Meiji Restoration]], the [[abolition of the han system|feudal domains were abolished]] and replaced with [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]], of which a total of six were initially created in the territory of modern Aomori Prefecture. These were merged into the short-lived Hirosaki Prefecture in July 1871.{{cn|date=July 2024}} However, due to the historic enmity between the former Tsugaru territories in the west and the former [[Nambu clan|Nambu territories]] in the east, the prefectural capital was relocated from Hirosaki to the more centrally-located Aomori immediately after the merger and the prefecture was renamed Aomori Prefecture on 23 September 1871. However, the municipality of Aomori was not given town status within [[Higashitsugaru District, Aomori|Higashitsugaru District]] until 1 April 1889, with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. It was later designated as a city on 1 April 1898.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

The [[Ministry of Colonial Affairs (Japan)|Hokkaidō Colonization Office]] began operations of a ferry service from Aomori to [[Hakodate, Hokkaido|Hakodate]] in Hokkaido from 1872. In September 1891, Aomori was connected with Tokyo by rail with the opening of the [[Tōhoku Main Line]]. The [[Ōu Main Line]] running along the [[Sea of Japan]] coast opened in December 1894. The development of modern Aomori was primarily due to its prefectural capital status and the singular importance as the terminus of these rail lines and the [[Seikan Ferry]], which officially opened in 1908.{{cn|date=July 2024}} The [[8th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|8th Division]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] were stationed in Aomori from 1896. In the winter of 1902, 199 of 210 soldiers on a military cold-weather readiness exercise perished while attempting to cross the Hakkōda Mountains from Aomori to Towada in what was later called the [[Hakkōda Mountains incident]].

Much of the town burned down in a large fire on 3 May 1910.{{cn|date=July 2024}} The port facilities were expanded in 1924, and the city received its first [[Aomori City Bus|bus]] services in 1926.{{cn|date=July 2024}} [[Japan Air Transport]] began scheduled air services from 1937.

Towards the final stages of [[World War II]], on the night of 28–29 July 1945, Aomori was subject to an [[strategic bombing|air raid]] as part of the [[strategic bombing]] campaign waged by the United States against military and civilian targets and population centers during the [[Japan campaign|Japan home islands campaign]]. The [[Bombing of Aomori in World War II|28–29 July bombing]] claimed 1,767 lives and destroyed 88% of the city.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

In the post-war period, Aomori was rebuilt as the local political and commercial center. The [[Tsugaru Line]] railway opened between Aomori Station and [[Kanita Station]] in 1951.

===Railways===
[[Aomori Station]] has been the main station of the city since 1891. The two trunk lines of the Tōhoku region, the [[Tōhoku Main Line]] (now the [[Aoimori Railway]]) and the [[Ōu Main Line]], terminated at Aomori Station and continued to Hakodate by the [[Seikan Ferry]]. In 1988, [[Seikan Tunnel]] replaced the ferry's role as the connector of Honshu and Hokkaido's rail networks, but the station still functioned as the connecting point between main line trains and trains for the Aomori-Hakodate section.

The [[Tōhoku Shinkansen]] opened in 2010 with a new terminal at [[Shin-Aomori Station]]. The Shinkansen provides high-speed service between {{STN|Shin-Aomori}}, {{STN|Hachinohe}}, {{STN|Morioka}}, {{STN|Sendai|Miyagi}} and {{STN|Tokyo}}.
