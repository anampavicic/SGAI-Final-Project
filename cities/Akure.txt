== History ==
{{Main|Akure Kingdom}}

=== Pre-1914 ===
[[File:Short oral history of Akure in Akure dialect by a native [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|speaker]] (non-subtitled).webm|thumb|250px|Short introductory expose of Akure in Akure dialect by a native speaker]]
[[Rock engraving]]s prior to the [[Mesolithic]] period, have been discovered on the outskirts of Akure. Also the oldest ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' fossil ever found in [[West Africa]] thus far was discovered there, dating back to around 11,000 years ago. The Akure Kingdom is regarded as one of the sixteen [[Ancient history|ancient]] [[Ekiti people|Ekiti kingdoms]].

According to oral history, a person by the name of Alakure founded Akure, but Omoremilekun Asodeboyede (a descendant of [[Oduduwa]]) actually established the present dynasty of monarchs and the modern Akure Kingdom. The Prince left [[Ile-Ife]], where Oduduwa ruled, in search of a place to settle after passing a strict test administered by Oduduwa himself, and eventually founded the city upon his arrival in the Akure region and his conquering of the Alakure. Asodeboyede represents the wave of princely descendants from Ile-Ife who ousted the indigenous rulers of the region. 
The Oba's Palace is located at the centre of the town, and was built in 1150&nbsp;AD.<ref>{{cite web

It has over 16 courtyards (ùà), with each having its unique purpose. Ùà Lílá (big courtyard, which serves as the town hall), Ùà Ùbúra (courtyard for swearing oaths), Ùà Jẹ́mifọhùn, Ùà Ùkómọ (courtyard for naming ceremonies), Ùà Ògògà (courtyard of the Ògògà), Ùà Oriole (courtyard for sacred religious oaths taken by chiefs and the king), Ùà Ojukoto (where religious ceremonies are held), Ùà Agbeto (courtyard where [[babalawo]] and priests of [[Ifa]] meet to offer prayers and council), Ùà Ameshe (where criminals were punished), are some of the names of the courtyards. At present, a bigger and more modern palace is being built to the south of the old palace's grounds. Oja Oba, which means the Oba's Market, is just a stone's throw away from the [[Palace]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2016-06-23 |title=Oja-Oba: New place for 'bend-down' clothes in Akure |url=https://www.sunnewsonline.com/oja-oba-new-place-for-bend-down-clothes-in-akure/ |access-date=2022-05-16 |website=The Sun Nigeria |language=en-US}}</ref>

Akure's King is known as the Deji of Akure and is supported by six (6) high chiefs (Iwarefa) in his or her domain. The totem of Akure is the Leopard. Omoremilekun (Asodeboyede), the first king of Akure, was himself called Ekun, meaning "Leopard" (this was his [[regnal name]]). It is for this reason that every descendant of the Akure [[clan]] has been addressed by outsiders as Omo Ekun during the recitation of his or her [[Oriki|praise poetry]] or, alternatively, as 'Omo Akure Oloyemekun', since Omoremilekun was said to have stayed for a while at Igbo Ooye ascending to the region that would become his kingdom.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2014-09-14 |title=Why Akure indigenes are called Omo Ekun or Oloyemekun |url=https://www.thenicheng.com/why-akure-indigenes-are-called-omo-ekun-or-oloyemekun/ |access-date=2022-05-16 |website=TheNiche |language=en-US}}</ref>

There are two other communities with their separate kings, cultures and traditions beside the Akure kingdom. The more prominent of the pair is [[Isinkan]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dada |first=Peter |date=2021-10-31 |title=Uneasy calm in Akure kingdom, Isikan community tackles Deji over chieftaincy stool |url=https://punchng.com/uneasy-calm-in-akure-kingdom-isikan-community-tackles-deji-over-chieftaincy-stool/ |access-date=2023-05-25 |website=Punch Newspapers |language=en-US}}</ref> while the second of them is Isolo. The ruler of Isinkan is known as the Iralepo while that of Isolo is known as the Osolo of Isolo. In the olden days, the three communities (Akure, Isinkan and Isolo) were located some distances apart. The war with the [[Benin empire]] in the pre-colonial period necessitated that the three communities move closer together however, and they have occupied their current positions ever since. Other nearby towns include Isarun, Ilara, Igbaraoke, Iju, Itaogbolu, Idanre, Owo, Ikere and Ondo.

The most influential Deji in recent history was Oba Adesida I who was known as Afunbiowo.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rapheal |date=2018-05-10 |title=Akure: City Swallowed By Rocks |url=https://sunnewsonline.com/akure/ |access-date=2023-05-25 |website=The Sun Nigeria |language=en}}</ref> Several Dejis after him were his direct descendants.
