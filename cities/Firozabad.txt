'''Firozabad''' is a city near [[Agra]] in [[Firozabad district]] in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in India. It is the centre of India's [[glassmaking]] industry and is known for the quality of the bangles and glassware produced here.

During the reign of [[Akbar]], revenue was brought through the city, which was looted by the Afghans. Akbar sent his army led by the Mansab Dar, Firoz Shah, to make the city a cantonment to collect taxes and the city of Chandrawar was renamed as Firozabad after him. The tomb of Firoz Shah is located in the city. From early times, it had glass and [[bangle]] works, and small scale industry. The landowners of Firozabad hail from the Siddiqui, Sayed, Manihar, Pathan and the Hindu Rajput castes. Firozabad is located in north central India, in Uttar Pradesh, {{cvt|37|km}} from [[Agra]] and around {{cvt|230|km}} from [[Delhi]], at the northern edge of the [[Deccan Plateau]], at {{Coord|27|09|N|78|24|E|}}. It is located {{convert|164|m}} above sea level.

The boundaries of Firozabad district touch [[Etah]] district in north and [[Mainpuri]] and [[Etawah]] districts in the east. The [[Yamuna]] river makes its southern boundary.

==History==
The city lies in the cultural region of [[Braj]] and was a part of the [[Surasena]] [[Mahajanapada]] during the [[Vedic Age]]. It was subsequently ruled by the bigger kingdoms including the Mauryas, Guptas, Scythians, Kushans, Indo-Greeks, Harsha before falling into the hands of [[Brahmin Peshwa]], Rajput rulers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999 |archive-date=2004-06-16 |title=Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns (Provisional) |access-date=2008-11-01 |publisher=Census Commission of India}}</ref>

Before the foundation of modern Firozabad, the main city in the area was at [[Chandwar]], on the left bank of the [[Yamuna]] a short distance southwest of Firozabad. Chandwar, a stronghold of the Chauhan Rajputs from an early date, was founded by a ruler named Chandrasen according to tradition. Chandwar was conquered several times by the [[Delhi Sultanate]], but its Chauhan rulers seem to have repeatedly asserted their independence over a period of several centuries. One tradition holds that the final defeat of the king [[Jayachandra]] by [[Muhammad of Ghor]] took place here, at the [[Battle of Chandwar]]. According to family traditions of the [[Bhadauria]]s, another conquest of Chandwar happened in 1246, which may be corroborated by the records kept by the Sultanate, which mention the capture of an unnamed Hindu stronghold in that same year. Then, after the Delhi Sultan [[Khizr Khan]] came to power in 1414, his general [[Taj ul-Mulk]] received submission from "the infidels of Chandwar" and then, in 1420, he sacked and looted Chandwar as punishment of some sort. In 1452, Chandwar was the site of [[Battle of Chandwar (1452)|a major battle]] between the Delhi and [[Jaunpur Sultanate]]s, which led to a three-year truce between the two empires.<ref name="Gazetteer">{{cite book |last1=Nevill |first1=H.R. |title=Agra: A Gazetteer |date=1905 |publisher=Government Press |location=Allahabad |pages=137–85, 238–9, 274–80 |url=https://dspace.gipe.ac.in/xmlui/handle/10973/37267 |access-date=22 January 2021}}</ref>

The modern city of Firozabad was founded c. 1566, when Raja [[Todar Mal]] was returning from a pilgrimage to [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] and stopped at the village of [[Asafabad, Firozabad|Asafabad]] (just southeast of modern Firozabad). The villagers insulted him, and when the emperor [[Akbar]] heard of this, he sent the eunuch [[Firoz Khwaja]] to demolish the town and build a new one. The city was built on lands belonging to several neighboring villages, including [[Akbarabad, Firozabad|Akbarabad]], [[Sukhmalpur]], [[Muhammadpur-Gajmalpur]], [[Rasulpur, Firozabad|Rasulpur]], and [[Pempur-Raipur]], and it was named ''Firozabad'' in honor of its founder. Firoz Khwaja's tomb, built of white marble, is by the road to Agra.<ref name="Gazetteer"/>

Mr. Peter, a businessman working for the [[Dutch East India Company]] visited Firozabad on 9 August 1632, and found the town in good condition. It is written in the gazetteer of Agra and [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] that in 1596 Faraz was upgraded to a ''[[pargana]]''. Faraz was bestowed to Nawab Sadulla Khan as ''[[jagir]]'', in the regime of Shahjahan. Jahangir ruled here from 1605 to 1627. Etawah, Budaun, Mainpuri, Faraz were under first class [[mansabdar]] of emperor Farrukhsiar. [[Baji Rao I]] looted Firozabad and [[Etmadpur]] in 1737 in the regime of [[Mohammad Shah]]. [[Jats]] of [[Mahawan]] attacked [[Faujdar Hakim Kajim ali bahadur jang]] at Firozabad and killed him on 9 May 1739. Jats ruled Firozabad for 30&nbsp;years. Gajuddin, [[Hidayat Vaksh]] son of [[Alamgir II|Alamgir]] second his nephew and [[Mirza baba]] the son in law, came to Firozabad. [[Mirza Nabab Khan]] stayed here until 1782. In the end of the 18th century, Firozabad was ruled by [[Himmat Bahadur]] with co-operation of [[Maratha]]s. The French Army chief of Marathas, D. Wayan, established an ordnance factory in November 1794. Mr. Thomas Traving also mentioned this fact in his book ''Travels in India''. Marathas appointed his [[subedar]] [[Lakwadads]] here who made a fort near old [[tehsil]], known at present as [[Garhaiya (fort)|garie]].

General Lek and General Vellajally attacked Firozabad in 1802. In the beginning of British regime Firozabad was in [[Etawah district]] but after some time it was attached to [[Aligarh district]]. When [[Sadabad (India)|Sadabad]] was created as a new district in 1832, Firozabad was attached to it. Later on, in 1833 Firozabad was attached to [[Agra district]]. In 1847, the business of [[Lac (resin)|lac]] was flourishing at Firozabad.

In 1857, Zamindar of Firozabad with local public took active parts in freedom struggle. Urdu poet [[Munir Shikohabad]]i was sentenced to [[Kala pani (taboo)|Kala pani]] by the British East India Company. People of this city took part in "Khilafat Movement", "Quit India Movement", and "Namak Satyagrah" and went to the jail during these national movements. In 1929, Father of Nation [[Mahatma Gandhi]], in 1935 [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]], in 1937 [[Pandit]] [[Jawahar Lal Nehru]] and in 1940 [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] visited Pandit Banarasi Das Chaturvedi, a two time member of Parliament - said to be the father of Hindi Journalism and the recipient of Padma Bushan. Firozabad district was finally established on 5 February 1989. In 2015 it became a Nagar Nigam.

Due to its proximity to Agra several trains on the Delhi Howrah route which don't stop at Firozabad station make a stop at [[Tundla]] Junction hence serving Firozabad as well as [[Agra]] cities.

Due to proximity to [[Agra]] and hence the borders of Uttar Pradesh with [[Rajasthan]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] states several inter-state bus services also serve the city. Intra-city transport typically consists of [[Rickshaws]] and [[Auto rickshaw|3-wheelers]]

The city is well connected with [[Yamuna Expressway]] and [[Taj Expressway]] to national capital [[New Delhi]] and state capital [[Lucknow]] respectively.

==Water pollution==
Since few years, Firozabad has been suffering with a severe water pollution problem. The water has been polluted by the indiscriminate discharge of wastes by the industries. The water has been rendered practically unusable. Citizens have no option but to install water purifiers at home and use packaged drinking water for consumption.<ref>http://www.icontrolpollution.com/articles/physicochemical-characteristics-of-glass-industries-waste-water-in-firozabad-district-up-india.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/agra-family-of-six-attempts-suicide-after-facing-acute-water-scarcity/articleshow/69917025.cms|title = Agra: Family of six attempts suicide after facing acute water scarcity &#124; Agra News - Times of India| newspaper=The Times of India | date=23 June 2019 }}</ref><ref>https://www.krishisanskriti.org/vol_image/11Sep201505090522.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220328231307/https://www.krishisanskriti.org/vol_image/11Sep201505090522.pdf |date=28 March 2022 }} {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref>
