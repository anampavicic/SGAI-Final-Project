Landmarks in the city include the old [[Salford Town Hall|town hall]], [[Salford Cathedral|cathedral]] and [[St Philip's Church, Salford|St Philips Church]]. It is the main settlement of the wider [[City of Salford]] metropolitan borough.

Nearby towns in the [[Greater Manchester Built-up Area|built-up area]] include [[Stretford]], [[Bolton]], [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]] and [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]] with additional towns nearby being [[Prestwich]], [[Radcliffe, Greater Manchester|Radcliffe]] and [[Urmston]].

===Early history===
[[File:The Cathedral Church of St John the Evangelist, Salford - geograph.org.uk - 1932239.jpg|thumb|[[Salford Cathedral]]]]

[[File:Hundred of Salford.png|thumb|right|The [[Salford (hundred)|Hundred of Salford]] was a [[Royal Manor]] of [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] origin centred on the [[demesne]] of Salford.]]
The earliest known evidence of human activity in what is now Salford is provided by the [[Neolithic]] flint arrow-heads and workings discovered on [[Kersal Moor]] and the River Irwell, suggesting that the area was inhabited 7–10,000 years ago. The raw material for such tools was scarce and unsuitable for working, and as a result they are not of the quality found elsewhere. Other finds include a neolithic axe-hammer found near Mode Wheel, during the excavation of the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] in 1890, and a [[Bronze Age]] [[cremation urn]] during the construction of a road on the Broughton Hall estate in 1873.<ref>{{Harvnb|Vigeon|1975|p=1}}.</ref><ref name="Cooperpp1819">{{Harvnb|Cooper|2005|pp=18–19}}.</ref>

The [[Brigantes]] were the major [[Celtic tribes in Britain and Ireland|Celtic tribe]] in what is now [[Northern England]]. With a stronghold at the sandstone outcrop on which [[Manchester Cathedral]] now stands, opposite Salford's original centre, their territory extended across the fertile lowland by the River Irwell that is now Salford and [[Stretford]]. Following the [[Roman conquest of Britain]], [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|General Agricola]] ordered the construction of a [[Castra|Roman fort]] named ''[[Mamucium]]'' (Manchester) to protect the routes to ''[[Deva Victrix]]'' ([[Chester]]) and ''[[Eboracum]]'' ([[York]]) from the Brigantes. Salford was founded when the fort was completed in AD&nbsp;79,<ref name="Cooperpp1819"/> and for over 300&nbsp;years the ''[[Pax Romana]]'' brought peace to the area. Both the main [[Roman road]] to the north, from Mamucium to [[Ribchester]], and a second road to the west, ran through what is now Salford, but few Roman artefacts have been found in the area.<ref name="Vigeonp2">{{Harvnb|Vigeon|1975|p=2}}.</ref> The withdrawal of the Romans in AD&nbsp;410 left the inhabitants at the mercy of the [[Saxons]]. The [[Danish people|Danes]] later conquered the area and absorbed what was left of the Brigantes.<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Bracegirdle | first1 = Cyril | title = The Dark River | year = 1973 | page = [https://archive.org/details/darkriver0000brac/page/18 18] | publisher = Sherratt | location = Altrincham | isbn = 0-85427-033-7 | url = https://archive.org/details/darkriver0000brac/page/18 }}</ref> [[Angles (tribe)|Angles]] settled in the region during the [[Early Middle Ages]] and gave the locality the name ''Sealhford'', meaning "ford by the willows".<ref name="Sealhford"/> According to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', ''Sealhford'' was part of the Kingdom of [[Northumbria]] until it was conquered in 923 by [[Edward the Elder]].<ref>Modern scholarship suggests that the year was actually 919. Vigeon (1975), p. 2.</ref>

Following the emergence of the united [[Kingdom of England]], Salford became a [[caput]] or central manor within a broad rural area in part held by the Kings of England, including [[Edward the Confessor]]. The area between the rivers [[River Mersey|Mersey]] and [[River Ribble|Ribble]] was divided into six smaller districts, referred to as "wapentakes", or [[Hundred (country subdivision)|hundreds]]. The south east district became known as the [[Salford (hundred)|Hundred of Salford]], a division of land administered from Salford for military and judicial purposes. It contained nine large parishes, smaller parts of two others, and the township of [[Aspull]] in the parish of [[Wigan]].<ref name="Vigeonp2"/><ref name="History of Salford">{{Citation|url=http://www.salford.gov.uk/living/yourcom/salfordlife/aboutsalford/salfordlocalhistory/localhistory-salford.htm |title=Salford&nbsp;– Local History  |publisher=Salford City Council |access-date=2 March 2008 |date=6 August 2003 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906140311/http://www.salford.gov.uk/living/yourcom/salfordlife/aboutsalford/salfordlocalhistory/localhistory-salford.htm |archive-date=6 September 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/types/status_page.jsp?unit_status=Hundred |title=Status details for Salford Hundred |publisher=visionofbritain.org.uk |access-date=8 June 2009 }}</ref><ref name="Kenyon166-167">{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1991|pp=166–167}}.</ref>

After the defeat of [[Harold Godwinson|Harold II]] during the [[Norman conquest of England]], [[William I of England|William&nbsp;I]] granted the Hundred of Salford to [[Roger the Poitevin]], and in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' of 1086 the Hundred of Salford was recorded as covering an area of {{convert|350|sqmi|km2|0}} with a population of 35,000.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hampson|1972|p=37}}.</ref> Poitevin created the subordinate [[Manchester Township (England)|Manor of Manchester]] out of the hundred, which has since in local government been separate from Salford. Poitevin forfeited the manor in 1102 when he was defeated in a failed rebellion attempt against [[Henry I of England|Henry&nbsp;I]]. In around 1115, for their support during the rebellion, Henry&nbsp;I placed the Hundred of Salford under the control of the [[Earl of Lancaster|Earldom of Lancaster]],<ref name="Kenyon166-167"/> and it is from this exchange that the Hundred of Salford became a [[royal manor]]. The [[Lord of the Manor]] was either the [[List of English monarchs|English monarch]], or a [[feudal]] land owner who administered the manor for the king.<ref name="GM Evolution"/> During the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] the Royal Manor of Salford passed to [[Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester]].<ref name="Kenyon166-167"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Hampson|1972|p=39}}.</ref>

Salford began to emerge as a small town early in the 13th century. In 1228, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] granted the caput of Salford the right to hold a market and an annual fair. The fairs were important to the town; a 17th-century order forced each [[Burgess (title)|burgess]]&nbsp;– a [[Freedom of the City|freeman of the borough&nbsp;]]&nbsp;– to attend, but the fairs were abolished during the 19th century.<ref name="Vigeonpp45">{{Harvnb|Vigeon|1975|pp=4–5}}.</ref> The Earls of Chester aided the development of the caput, and in 1230 [[Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester]] made Salford a [[burgage]], or free borough.<ref name="Kenyon166-167"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge|1841|p=350}}</ref> The [[charter]] gave its burgesses certain commercial rights, privileges and advantages over traders living outside Salford; one of the 26&nbsp;clauses of the charter stated that no one could work in the Hundred of Salford unless they also lived in the borough.<ref name="GM Evolution"/><ref name="Cooper12" /><ref name="Vigeonpp45"/> Salford's status as a burgage encouraged an influx of distinguished families, and by the [[Late Middle Ages]] Salford was "rich in its [[manor house]]s", with over&nbsp;30 within a {{convert|5|mi|km|0|adj=on}} radius of [[Ordsall, Greater Manchester|Ordsall]].<ref name="GM Evolution"/> These included [[Ordsall Hall]] (owned by the Radclyffe family) and [[Broughton, Greater Manchester|Broughton Hall]], owned by the [[Earl of Derby|Earls of Derby]].<ref name="GM Evolution"/><ref name="History of Salford"/>

During the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] of 1640–49, Salford supported the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] cause, in contrast to Manchester just across the Irwell which declared in favour of the [[Roundheads|Parliamentarians]]. Royalist forces mounted a siege of Manchester across what is now the site of Victoria Bridge, which although short-lived, "did little to improve relations between the two towns". A century later, in 1745, Salford was staunchly in support of [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]], in his attempt to seize the [[Throne of England]]. He entered the town at the head of his army and was blessed by the Reverend John Clayton before leaving "in high spirits" to march on London; he returned to Salford in defeat just nine days later.<ref name="Cooper23">{{Harvnb|Cooper|2005|p=23}}</ref>

===Industrial Revolution===
[[File:Map of Manchester 1801.PNG|thumb|right|A map of Manchester and Salford in 1801]]
Salford has a history of textile processing that pre-dates the [[Industrial Revolution]], and as an old town had been developing for about 700&nbsp;years.<ref name="Tomlinsonp19">{{Harvnb|Tomlinson|1975|p=19}}.</ref> Before the introduction of cotton there was a considerable trade in [[wool]]len goods and [[fustian]]s.<ref name="McNev42"/> Other [[cottage industries]] prevalent at this time included [[clogging]], [[cobbling]], [[weaving]] and brewing.<ref name="Cooper31">{{Harvnb|Cooper|2005|p=31}}.</ref> The changes to [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]] had a profound effect on both on population and urbanisation, as well as the [[socioeconomic]] and cultural conditions of Salford.

The well-established textile processing and trading infrastructure, and the ready supply of water from the River Irwell and its tributaries, attracted entrepreneurs who built [[cotton mill]]s along the banks of the river in [[Pendleton, Greater Manchester|Pendleton]] and [[Ordsall, Greater Manchester|Ordsall]]. Although Salford followed a similar pattern of industrial development to Manchester, most businesses preferred to build their premises on the Manchester side of the Irwell, and consequently Salford did not develop as a commercial centre in the same way as its neighbour.<ref name="McNev42"/> Many of these earlier mills had been based on [[Richard Arkwright|Arkwright]]-type designs. These relied on strong falls of water, but Salford is on a meander of the Irwell with only a slight gradient and thus mills tended to be built upstream, at Kersal and Pendleton. However, with the introduction of the [[steam engine]] in the late 18th century, merchants began to construct mills closer to the centres of Salford and Manchester, where supplies of labour and coal were more readily available (the first steam-powered mill was built in Manchester in 1780). One of the first factories to be built was Philip's and Lee's Twist Mill in Salford,<ref name="McNev42"/> completed in 1801, the second iron-framed multi-story building to be erected in Britain.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Skempton |first1=A. W.|last2=Chrimes |first2=M.|title=A Biographical Dictionary of Civil Engineers in Great Britain and Ireland: 1500 to 1830|publisher=Thomas Telford|year=2002|volume=1|page=400|isbn=978-0-7277-2939-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jeOMfpYMOtYC&q=Salford+twist+mill&pg=PA401|access-date=5 February 2008}}</ref> The large Salford Engine Twist Company mill was built to the west of Salford, between Chapel Street and the Irwell, and in 1806 was the first large cotton mill to use gas lighting. Many engineering companies were established in this area, including [[Samuel Ellis and Company]] at the Irwell Foundry.<ref name=Eade2013>{{eade |name=below}}</ref> However, it was outnumbered by the numerous smaller factories and mills throughout the area, including Nathan Gough's steam-driven mule spinning mill, near Oldfield Road, where a serious accident occurred on 13 October 1824 (see illustration).<ref>{{Harvnb|Tomlinson|1975|pp=25–28, p. 35}}.</ref>

Canal building provided a further stimulus for Salford's industrial development. The opening of the [[Bridgewater Canal]] in 1761 improved the transport of fuel and raw materials, reducing the price of coal by about 50%.<ref name=Bridgewatercollieries>{{Citation |title=The Times newspaper: Bridgewater Collieries | url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?toDate=31%20December%201985&fromDate=1%20January%201785&currentPageNumber=1&resultsPerPage=10&sortBy=default&offset=0&viewName=&addFilters=&removeFilters=&addCat=&queryKeywords=bridgewater+canal&sectionId=1040&currPgSmartSet=1&pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1913-12-01-08&articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1913-12-01-08-001&xmlpath=&pubId=17&totalResults=1638&addRefineFilters=&removeRefineFilters=&addRefineCat=&next_Page=false&prev_Page=false&date_dd_From=1&date_mm_From=01&date_yyyy_From=1785&date_dd_to_range=31&date_mm_to_range=12&date_yyyy_to_range=1985&date_dd_from_precise=1&date_mm_from_precise=01&date_yyyy_from_precise=1785&isDateSearch=false&dateSearchType=range&refineQuerykeywordText= |date=1 December 1913 |access-date=19 July 2008 }}{{dead link|date=September 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} </ref> The later [[Manchester, Bolton & Bury Canal]] (which terminated at Salford) brought more cheap coal from pits at Pendleton, [[Agecroft Colliery]] and beyond. By 1818 Manchester, Salford and [[Eccles, Greater Manchester|Eccles]] had about 80&nbsp;mills, but it was the completion of the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] in 1894 which triggered Salford's development as a major [[inland port]].<ref name="McNev42"/> [[Salford Docks]], a major [[Dock (maritime)|dockland]] on the Ship Canal {{convert|35|mi|km|0}} east of the [[Irish Sea]], brought employment to over 3,000&nbsp;labourers.<ref name="McNev46">{{Harvnb|McNeil|Nevell|2000|pp=46–47}}.</ref> By 1914 the [[Port of Manchester]], most of whose docks were in Salford, had become one of the largest port authorities in the world, handling 5% of the UK's imports and 4.4% of its exports. Commodities handled included cotton, grain, wool, textile machinery and steam locomotives.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cooper|2005|pp=101–103}}.</ref>

For centuries, textiles and related trades were the main source of employment in the town.<ref name="Cooper31"/> Bleaching was a widely distributed finishing trade in Salford, carried over from the earlier woollen industry. In the 18th century, before the introduction of chemical bleaching, bleaching fields were commonplace, some very close to the town. In 1773 there were 25&nbsp;bleachers around Salford, most to the west of the township. Printing was another source of trade; the earliest recorded in the region was a calique printer in the Manchester Parish Register of 1763.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tomlinson|1975|pp=23–25}}.</ref> These industries became more important as Salford faced increasing competition from the nearby towns of [[Bolton]] and [[Oldham]]. As its [[Spinning (textiles)|cotton spinning]] industries faltered its economy turned increasingly to other textiles and to the finishing trades, including [[rexine]] and silk dyeing, and fulling and bleaching, at a string of works in Salford.<ref name="McNev42"/>

[[File:Manchester Dock No 9.jpg|thumb|right|The opening of the [[Salford Docks]] turned Salford into a major [[inland port]] along the ocean-going [[Manchester Ship Canal]]. This site is now occupied by [[The Lowry]].]]
Both [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] spent time in Salford, studying the plight of the British working class. In ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'', Engels described Salford as "really one large working-class quarter&nbsp;... [a] very unhealthy, dirty and dilapidated district which, while other industries were almost always textile related is situated opposite the 'Old Church' of Manchester".<ref name="Engels74">{{Harvnb|Engels|1958|p=74}}</ref>

The effect on Salford of the Industrial Revolution has been described as "phenomenal". The area expanded from a small market town into a major industrial [[metropolis]]; factories replaced cottage industries, and the population rose from&nbsp;12,000 in 1812 to 70,244&nbsp;within 30&nbsp;years. By the end of the 19th century it had increased to&nbsp;220,000. Large-scale building of low quality [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[terraced housing]] did not stop overcrowding, which itself led to chronic social deprivation. The density of housing was as high as 80&nbsp;homes per acre.<ref name="History of Salford"/><ref name="Cooper35">{{Harvnb|Cooper|2005|p=35}}.</ref> Private roads were built for the use of the middle classes moving to the outskirts of Salford. The entrances to such roads, which included Elleray Road in [[Irlams o' th' Height]], were often gated, and patrolled.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hayes|2003|p=25}}.</ref>

====Inventions====
Salford is credited as the birthplace of the [[roller chain|Bush Roller Chain]]. [[Hans Renold]], a Swiss-born engineer, came to Salford in the late 19th century. In 1879 he purchased a small textile-chain making business in Ordsall from James Slater and founded the [[Hans Renold Company]], what is now Renold, a firm which still produces chains. Renold invented the bush roller chain shortly after and began producing it. It is the type of chain most commonly used for transmission of mechanical power on bicycles, motorbikes, to industrial and [[agricultural machinery]] to uses as varied as rollercoasters and [[escalator]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Day|McNeil|1996|p=596}}.</ref>

===Post-industrial decline===
[[File:The Crescent, Pendleton.jpg|thumb|right|Following the demise of local manufacturing industries, a 1960s regeneration project saw the construction of over 30&nbsp;[[tower block]]s in the city, replacing many of Salford's former [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] slums.]]
[[File:Thursfield Street, Salford.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Housing Market Renewal Initiative]] has identified Salford as having areas with [[terraced housing]] unsuited to modern needs.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.blitzandblight.com/terrace-housing|publisher=blitzandblight.com|access-date=22 January 2009|title=Terrace housing|date=14 September 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717082126/http://www.blitzandblight.com/terrace-housing|archive-date=17 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>]]

During the early 20th century, improvements in regional transport infrastructure precipitated the decline of Salford's existing industries, including those at the [[Salford Docks]].

A survey in 1931 concluded that parts of Salford contained some of the worst [[slum]]s in the country. Many houses were infested by rats and lacked elementary amenities. Inspectors found that of 950&nbsp;houses surveyed, 257&nbsp;were in a state of bad repair with leaking roofs, broken flooring and rotten woodwork. The inspectors were "struck by the courage and perseverance with which the greater number of tenants kept their houses clean and respectable under most adverse conditions".<ref name="CooperP41" /> By 1933, [[Slum clearance in the United Kingdom|slum clearance]] projects were under way,<ref>{{Harvnb|Manchester Evening News Staff|2007|p=5}}</ref> and by the end of 1956 over a thousand families had been rehoused in [[overspill estate]]s at [[Little Hulton]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Manchester Evening News Staff|2007|p=12}}</ref> These clearances have, for some, changed the character of the area to such an extent that "observers in search of the typical Salford may have to look in Eccles and Swinton, for much of the community and townscape&nbsp;... has gone from Salford, replaced by tall blocks of flats".<ref name="Clark14">{{Harvnb|Clark|1973|p=14}}.</ref> Large areas of the city were redeveloped in the 1960s and 1970s, with [[Victorian era]] terraced housing estates that inspired painter [[L.

Despite extensive redevelopment, throughout the 1980s and 1990s the area experienced high levels of deprivation and unemployment, particularly during the recessions of the early years of both decades. This social deprivation was a major factor in the increased levels of [[Gangs in the United Kingdom|gang crime]] linked to illegal narcotics, firearms and robberies. This was comparable to the similar issues faced in parts of neighbouring [[Manchester]] including [[Moss Side]], as well as areas of the more distant neighbouring city of [[Liverpool]].

[[Organised crime]] in Salford, particularly in Ordsall and Pendleton, "began to have a disturbing effect on grass roots democracy.

The Irwell, sourced at [[Cliviger]] in Lancashire, flows from the north and for a distance forms the statutory boundary between Salford and Manchester.

Salford's built environment is made up of a range of building stock. Some inner-city areas are noted for chronic [[urban decay]]. Salford's housing stock is characterised by an oversupply of older, smaller terraced housing and flatted accommodation that declined in value during the late 20th century. As demand fell, it left many owners in [[negative equity]] and often without the means to maintain their homes in reasonable condition. As a result, much of the built environment is poor.<ref name="Renewal"/>

===City centre===
Salford is polycentric (has more than one centre). The main city centre could be considered to be located around Bexley Square near where the town hall and cathedral are located. However, its main shopping centres are [[Salford Shopping Centre]] in [[Pendleton, Greater Manchester|Pendleton]] and [[Salford Quays]]. As the city has expanded and incorporated [[Eccles, Greater Manchester|Eccles]], [[Walkden]], [[Swinton, Greater Manchester|Swinton]] and [[Pendlebury]], there are now retail and economic centres belonging to these towns.

In 2011, 22.7% of the population in the Salford USD (Urban Subdivision) were non-white British, compared with 15.6% for the surrounding borough. The USD had a slightly larger percentage of Asian and black people. Salford has become a lot more ethnically diverse since the previous census, mostly due to boundary changes, but also due to the relocation of many [[BBC]] departments from London between 2011 and 2012. This has created many jobs and encouraged migration to the area, which was previously very deprived since the loss of many traditional industries in the 20th century.

According to the 2001 UK census, the industry of employment of Salford's residents aged 16–74 was 18.0% retail and wholesale, 14.4% property and business services, 12.3% manufacturing, 11.7% health and social work, 8.6% education, 7.3% transport and communications, 6.8% hotels and restaurants, 5.8% construction, 4.4% finance, 4.2% public administration, 0.6% energy and water supply, 0.3% agriculture, 0.1% mining, and 5.7% other. Compared with national figures, Salford had a relatively low percentage of residents working in agriculture.<ref>{{Citation |title=Census 2001 Key Statistics – Urban area results by population size of urban area |agency=Office for National Statistics |url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-211152 |date=22 July 2004 |access-date=8 June 2009 |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|at=[http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/census-2001-key-statistics/urban-area-results-by-population-size-of-urban-area/urban-area-results-by-population-size-of-urban-area-ks11a--industry-of-employment---all-people.xls KS11a Industry of employment – all people] {{XLSlink}}}}</ref> The census recorded the economic activity of residents aged 16–74, 4.4% students were with jobs, 9.1% students without jobs, 6.3% looking after home or family, 11.2% permanently sick or disabled, and 4.8% economically inactive for other reasons.<ref name="Qualifications2001"/> The proportion of students economically active in Salford was higher than the City of Salford and England averages (3.0% and 2.6% respectively); the same is true for economically inactive students (5.1% in City of Salford and 4.7% in England).

The [[Liverpool & Manchester Railway]]&nbsp;– the world's first [[steam locomotive|steam driven]] inter-city passenger railway&nbsp;– opened through Salford on 15 September 1830. The railway was primarily built to provide faster transport of materials and goods between the [[Port of Liverpool]] and [[factory|mills]] in Manchester and surrounding towns, and stopped along the route at <!-- Weaste, Seedley, Cross Lane, - were these in 'Salford', and also should the Manchester and Southport line be included? --> [[Ordsall Lane railway station]].<ref>{{Citation | title = Liverpool and Manchester Railway | url = http://www.subbrit.org.uk/sb-sites/stations/o/ordsall_lane/index.shtml | format = For other stations see links in article | publisher = subbrit.org.uk | access-date=1 June 2009 }}</ref> Almost eight years later the [[Manchester and Bolton Railway]] was opened, terminating at [[Salford Central railway station]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bardsley|1960|p=7.}}</ref>

By 1801 the population of both Manchester and Salford was about 94,000. By 1861 this had risen to about 460,000, and so in the same year John Greenwood Jr. made an application to Salford Borough Council and to the Pendleton Turnpike Trust, to build a tramway from Pendleton to Albert Bridge in Salford. The system was innovative in that the rails were designed to be 'flush' with the road surface, with a third central rail to accommodate a perambulator wheel attached to the front axle of the omnibus. Approval was granted and work commenced immediately, with the horse-pulled tramway finished in September 1861. It remained in use for a further eleven years when the condition of the track had deteriorated such that the council ordered it removed. The [[Tramways Act 1870]] ([[33 & 34 Vict.]] c. 78) allowed councils to construct their own tramways, and on 17 May 1877 the 'Manchester and Salford Tramways' opened for business. The network of lines was largely complete by September 1880, the company changed its name to the [[Manchester Carriage & Tramways Company]], and the system reached its peak in the 1890s. A steam tramway was opened on 12 April 1883 from Bury to Higher Broughton. The vehicles provoked letters of complaints from residents about the associated noise, dirt, and grease, and by 1888 the route was eventually curtailed to [[Besses o' th' Barn]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Tomlinson|1975|pp=79–82}}</ref>

Electric trams were a common sight in early 20th century Salford, and had from 1901 replaced the earlier horse-drawn vehicles. A network of lines crossed the region, with coordinated services running through Salford, Manchester and the surrounding areas.

Early worship took place at the parish church of Manchester, however a small chantry chapel existed in 1368 on the only bridge linking the two settlements. In the 16th century, it was converted into a dungeon, and was later demolished in 1779. In 1634–35, Humphrey Booth, a wealthy local merchant, opened a chapel of ease, which a year later was consecrated as the Chapel of Sacred Trinity (the parish of Sacred Trinity was created in 1650).<ref>Hartwell, C., et al.
