'''Larache''' ({{langx|ar|العرائش|al-'Ara'ish}}) is a city in northwestern [[Morocco]]. It is on the Moroccan coast, where the [[Loukkos River]] meets the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Larache is one of the most important cities of the [[Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima]] region.

Many civilisations and [[culture]]s have influenced the [[history]] of Larache, starting in the ancient city of Lixus during the 12th century{{nbsp}}BCE. Between the period of being a strategic [[Berbers|Berber]] town and then a [[Phoenicia]]n trading centre to Morocco's independence era around the 1950s, Larache was a nexus for many cultures.

==History==
[[File:Eigentliche Abbildung der Starken Vestung Larache ein furnhemer Meerhaven in Barbarien, welche, in Nahmen Königlicher Majest - von Hispanien durch den Marckgraven von S.Germein ist eingenomen worden A°... - btv1b8440776q (2 of 2).jpg|thumb|left|1610 map showing the [[Cession of Larache]], depicting the town as the largest in the region]]
[[File:Ville de Larache en 1670.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the port of Larache around 1670.]]
The city is not mentioned in Arabic historical sources until the 13th century. It was founded by the [[Idrisid dynasty|Idrisite]] Banu 'Arus.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Dargahinfo - Complete Collection of Dargahs World Wide |url=http://dargahinfo.com/Dargah_History.aspx?HID=314 |access-date=2023-06-03 |website=dargahinfo.com}}</ref> Because of the abundant [[Vine|vines]] in the area, they named it ''al-'Ara'ish'', meaning "[[Trellis (architecture)|trellis]] of grape vines", or ''al-'Arīsh mtā' Bnī 'Arūs'' ("grape vine trellis of the Banu 'Arus") in longer form.<ref name=":0">{{Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition|volume=1|pages=604–605|last1=Yver|first1=G.|last2=Ricard|first2=R.|article=al-ʿArāʾis̲h̲}}</ref> The Almohad caliph [[Ya’qub al-Mansur|Ya'qub al-Mansur]] (r. 1184–1199) built a fortress here in the late 12th century. In 1270, the Spanish led a successful raid on the city.<ref name=":0" />

In 1471, the Portuguese settlers from [[Asilah]] and [[Tangier]] drove the inhabitants out of Larache, and again it remained uninhabited until the [[Saadi dynasty|Saadi Sultan]] [[Mohammed ash-Sheikh]] decided to repopulate it and build a stronghold on the plateau above river Loukos. He constructed a fortress at the entrance to the port as a means of controlling access to the river.

For a long time, attempts by the Portuguese, Spanish and French to take it met with no success. The Portuguese established the nearby [[Graciosa fortress]] in 1489. The Kasbah, which was built in 1491 by Moulay en Nasser, later became a pirate stronghold. 

In 1610, [[Cession of Larache|the town passed to the Spanish]], who stayed there until 1689, but who mainly used the ports as trading stops and never really administered the town. [[Moulay Ismail]] finally [[Siege of Larache (1689)|conquered Larache in 1689]].

Attacks on Larache continued, but it still remained in Muslim hands. In 1765, a French fleet failed in the [[Larache expedition]]. In 1829, the Austrians punitively bombarded the city due to Moroccan piracy.<ref name=EB>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title='Abd ar-Rasham|edition=15th|year=2010|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|volume=I: A-Ak - Bayes|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/17 17]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/17}}</ref> Due to the [[Spanish Protectorate of Morocco|colonisation era]], [[Larache landing|Spain took Larache in 1911]] and held it for 45 years until 1956.

=== Lixus ===
{{main|Lixus (ancient city)}}
[[Image:Lixus.jpg|thumb|The ruins of Lixus]][[Lixus (ancient city)|Lixus]] is the site of an ancient city located in Morocco just north of the modern seaport of Larache on the bank of the Loukkos River. It was built by a Berber king in 1180 BC. Lixus was one of the [[Mauretania|Kingdom of Mauretania]]'s ancient cities.

It was settled by the Phoenicians in the 7th century BC. Lixus was part of a chain of Phoenician/Carthaginian settlements; other major settlements further to the south are Chellah and Mogador. When Carthage fell to Ancient Rome, Lixus, Chellah and Mogador were annexed to the [[Mauretania|Kingdom of Mauretania]].

This ancient Mauritanian city gradually grew in importance, later coming under Carthaginian domination. After the destruction of Carthage, Lixus fell to Amazigh (Berber) control, reaching its zenith during the reign of the Mauritanian king Juba II.

Some ancient Greek writers located at Lixus the mythological garden of the Hesperides, the keepers of the golden apples. The name of the city which was often mentioned by writers from Hanno the Navigator to the Geographer of Ravenna and confirmed by the legend on its coins and by an inscription. The ancients believed this to be the site of the Garden of the Hesperides and of a sanctuary of Hercules, where Hercules gathered gold apples, more ancient than the one at Cadiz, Spain. However, there are no grounds for the claim that Lixus was founded at the end of the second millennium BC. Life was maintained there nevertheless until the Islamic conquest of North Africa by the presence of a mosque and a house with a patio with walls covered with painted stuccos.

Larache offers 3 types of education systems: Arabic, French and Spanish . Each offers classes starting from pre-Kindergarten up to the 12th grade, as for German in the three last years of high school.
