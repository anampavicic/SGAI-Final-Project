{{nihongo|'''Sasebo'''|佐世保市|Sasebo-shi}} is a [[Core cities of Japan|core city]] located in [[Nagasaki Prefecture]], Japan. It is the second-largest city in Nagasaki Prefecture, after its capital, [[Nagasaki]]. {{As of |2024|04|01}}, the city had an estimated [[population]] of 230,873 in 102,670 households, and a  [[population density]] of 540 persons per km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name="Sasebo-hp">{{cite web |url=https://www.city.sasebo.lg.jp/kikaku/seisak/toukei-jinkou.htmll|title= Sasebo City official statistics|location= Japan|language= ja}}</ref> The total area of the city is {{cvt|426.01|km2}}.

==Geography==
Sasebo is located in the northwestern part of Kyushu, in the northern part of Nagasaki Prefecture, from the base of the [[Kitamatsuura Peninsula]] to the central and southern part of the peninsula. It is located about 50 kilometers north-northwest of Nagasaki City (the shortest distance by land is about 60 kilometers). The west, southwest, and southern parts of the city face the sea, and the east borders [[Saga Prefecture]]. The city includes the island of [[Ukujima]], at the northern end of the [[Goto Islands]]. Although not as steep as Nagasaki City, the city is characterized by many hills. Because the mountains approach the central downtown area in the center of the city, bicycles are not widely used. Parts of the city are within the borders of the [[Saikai National Park]].

==History==
The area of present-day Sasebo was part of ancient [[Hizen Province]]. It was a small fishing village under the control of nearby [[Hirado Domain]] until shortly after the start of the [[Meiji period]]. [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] Admiral [[Tōgō Heihachirō]], when surveying the coasts of northwestern Kyūshū for the site of a navy base, selected this location based on its protected, deep-water harbor, geographic proximity to [[China]] and [[Korea]], and the presence of nearby [[Coal mining|coal fields]].  [[Sasebo Naval District]], founded in 1886, became the major port for the Japanese navy in its operations in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and [[Russo-Japanese War]]. It remained a major naval base to the end of [[World War II]]. Along with the base facilities, the navy also constructed the [[Sasebo Naval Arsenal]], which included major shipyards and repair facilities. After the end of the war, part of the base facilities were taken over by the [[United States Navy]], which formed [[U.S. Fleet Activities Sasebo]]. Some parts of the base are shared with the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]], in particular the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force|JMSDF]]. The primary base of the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force|JGSDF]]'s [[Western Army Infantry Regiment]] is also among the facilities there.

The village of Sasebo was established on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. It was raised directly to city status on April 1, 1902. Sasebo annexed the neighboring villages: Sase, Hio and Hirota on April 1, 1927 and town of Ainoura on April 1, 1938. The city had 206,000 inhabitants in 1945 and suffered severe damage by United States [[strategic bombing|bombing]] on June 29, 1945, during [[World War II]]. 48% of the city was destroyed.<ref>John Keegan: ''Atlas Zweiter Weltkrieg'', S. 196. Augsburg 1999</ref> Sasebo was one of the original 17 targets considered by the United States as a target for the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bomb]] intended to end the war.  The city continued to grow by annexing neighboring municipalities: Ono, Minamise, Nakazato, Saki (May 27, 1942), Yuzuki and Kuroshima (April 1, 1954), Orioze, Egami, Sakihario (April 1, 1955), Miya (August 1, 1958). On April 1, Sasebo was designated a [[Special cities of Japan|special city]] with increased local autonomy. This designation was raised to [[Core cities of Japan|core city]] on April 1, 2016.

*On April 1, 2005, the towns of [[Sechibaru, Nagasaki|Sechibaru]] and [[Yoshii, Nagasaki|Yoshii]] (both from [[Kitamatsuura District, Nagasaki|Kitamatsuura District]]) were merged into Sasebo.
*On March 31, 2006, the towns of [[Kosaza, Nagasaki|Kosaza]] and [[Uku, Nagasaki|Uku]] (both from [[Kitamatsuura District, Nagasaki|Kitamatsuura District]]) were merged into Sasebo.
