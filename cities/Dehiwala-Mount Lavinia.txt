== Etymology ==
There are many stories about the history of this area. One of those is Diya Wala which means a dip or hole filled with water. In the past this area was full of ponds and lakes; thus it became known as Diyawala (an area filled with water) and later on it became Dehiwala. Another story in regard to this name is that this area has many [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] trees or a forest of lime trees and people called it Dehiwala. It is said that the king of Kotte filled all his lime requirements from this area.<ref name=":0" />

== History ==
Before colonisation of the maritime region by the Portuguese, the area covered by the present DMMC was part of the Kingdom of Kotte. It comprised a number of villages such as Pepiliyana Nedimala, Attidiya and Kalubowila, while Ratmalana and areas south of Dehiwala were together one large expanse of marshland, and scarcely populated.<ref name=":1" />

=== Portuguese era ===
During the Portuguese occupation, the Kingdom of Kotte was ruled by king Don Juan Dharmapala, and it encompassed the above-mentioned villages. Early records also indicate that in the year 1510 AD the village of “Galkissa” is mentioned and named after the rocky mound (Lihiniyagala) protruding into the Bay. Fascinating tales are woven round this rock and the village “Galkissa”. The Dutch invaders called the mound “the pregnant wench”.

=== Dutch era ===
With the arrival of the Dutch in the early seventeenth century, a more organised administrative structure was in place, whereby a broad-based taxation and legal system evolved.

=== British era ===
However, it was only during British occupation (19th Century) that a Provincial administrative (Kachcheri) system and a form of Local Government developed. When the second [[Governors of British Ceylon|Governor of Ceylon]], [[Thomas Maitland (British Army officer)|Sir Thomas Maitland]], acquired land at "Galkissa" ([[Mount-Lavinia|Mount Lavinia]]), he decided in 1806 to construct a personal residence there. Maitland fell in love with Lovina Aponsuwa, a local [[Mestiços (Sri Lanka)|mestiço]] dancer, and continued a romantic affair with her until he was recalled to England in 1811. The Governor's mansion, which he named "Mount Lavinia House" is now the [[Mount Lavinia Hotel]] and the village that surrounded the building has subsequently developed into a bustling area, taking its name from the Governor's mistress, Lovina.  Later, the area assumed the name of Mount Lavinia alluding to the factual story of a romance between the then British Governor Thomas Maitland (1805–1812) and a dancing girl called Lovina of the area.

=== After Independence ===
Dehiwela, Mount Lavinia attained Municipal status in December 1959. Dehiwela Mount Lavinia as a Local body of 6 wards extending over a land extent of only 16.3&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> ({{convert|1,630|ha|acres|abbr=on}}). Due to rapid urban growth and for administrative reasons this area was extended and divided into 19 wards in 1959 and given Municipal status. Later in 1967 the municipality was increased to an area of approximately {{convert|2,109|ha|acres|abbr=on}} was apportioned into 29 wards, as it exists today.

== Geography ==
As the Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia area lies on the coastal plain the land is mostly flat and undulating towards the inland areas. A significant feature is the large extent of wetlands around the Weras Ganga (river) and Bolgoda Lake, the two major water bodies. The Bellanwila and Attidiya marshes are noteworthy for their biodiversity and as such are considered as an ecological protected zone. Lying in the wet zone, the Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia area receives an average annual rainfall between {{cvt|2000-3000|mm}} mainly during the southwest monsoon and the intermonsoon periods. The mean average day temperature is around {{cvt|28|C}} and the average maximum between 30.5 and 31&nbsp;°C. The minimum night temperature varies from 26&nbsp;°C to 27&nbsp;°C.<ref name=":1" />
