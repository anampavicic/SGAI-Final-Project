'''Mary''' ({{IPA-tk|mɑˈɾɯ}}; Cyrillic: Мары, 1992–1993: Marx), formerly named '''[[Merv]]''',<ref>[https://collections.lib.uwm.edu/digital/collection/agdm/id/23798/rec/6 1929 Soviet Turkmenistan map]</ref> '''Meru''' and '''Alexandria [[Margiana]]''', is a city on an [[oasis]] in the [[Karakum Desert]] in [[Turkmenistan]], located on the [[Murgab River]]. It is the capital city of [[Mary Region]].

==Etymology==
Atanyýazow notes that the name "Muru" appears in [[Zoroaster|Zoroastrian]] texts alongside the toponyms Sogd ([[Sogdia]]) and Bakhti ([[Bactria]]), and that the name "Margiana" appears carved into rocks at [[Behistun]], [[Iran]], dating back 2,500 years.  Atanyyazow adds, "the name was used in the form Merv-ash-Shahizhan", with subsequent forms including Muru, Mouru, Margiana, Marg, Margush, Maru, Maru-shahu-jahan, Maru-Shahu-ezan, [[Merv]], and Mary, and that some scholars interpret the word ''marg'' as "green field" or "grassland", noting that in Persian ''marg'' can mean a source of livestock.<ref name=atanyyazov>{{cite book|title= Түркменистаның Географик Атларының Дүшүндиришли Сөзлүги|trans-title= Explanatory Dictionary of Geographic Names in Turkmenistan  |page=205 |publisher=Ылым |date=1980 |place=Ashgabat |first=Soltanşa |last=Atanyýazow|url=https://www.twirpx.com/file/2683178/ }}</ref>

==History==
The ancient city of [[Merv]] was an oasis city on the [[Silk Road]].  It was destroyed and its population annihilated in the 13th century by the [[Mongols]]. Because of its location on the Silk Road, it revived over time only to be largely destroyed again in the 19th century by nomadic [[Teke (Turkmen tribe)|Teke]] raiders.  Edmund O'Donovan described Merv in 1882 as

{{quote|...&nbsp;only a "geographical expression". It means a certain amount of cultivated territory where half a million Tekke-Turkomans manage to eke out an existence by pastoral pursuits, plunder, and thievery, combined with the caravan service between Bokhara and Meshed.  There is no central point which you can call Merv now, if I except the place which has grown into existence since my arrival. I speak of Koushid Khan Kala, a fort at a point on the river Murghab&nbsp;...<ref name=odonovan>{{cite book|title=The Country of the Turkomans|date=1977|publisher=Oguz Press and the Royal Geographical Society|place=London|isbn=0-905820-01-0}}, Chapter 15, O'Donovan, Edmund, ''Merv and Its Surroundings'', lecture delivered in 1882.</ref>}}

It was occupied by [[Imperial Russia]] in 1884, triggering the [[Panjdeh incident]] between Afghanistan, British forces, and the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. The modern settlement was founded later that year as a Russian military and administrative post.

A force of the [[British Indian Army]] consisting of a [[machine gun]] detachment comprising 40 [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] troops and a British officer resisted the Bolsheviks near Merv in August 1918, in what was the first direct confrontation between British and Russian troops since the [[Crimean War]].<ref>[[Peter Hopkirk]] (1994). ''On Secret Service East of Constantinople''. John Murray.</ref>

The area surrounding Mary was developed by the [[Soviet Union]] as a center for [[cotton]] production through the use of extensive [[irrigation]]. The ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' article on Mary reads in part,

{{quote|Mary (until 1937 Merv), city, center of Mary oblast' of Turkmen SSR. Located on the Murghab River and Karakum Canal. Junction of railroad lines to Tashkent, Krasnovodsk, and Kushka. 67 thousand residents (1973; 8.5 thousand in 1897, 37 thousand in 1939, 48 thousand in 1959). Large wool degreasing plant, cotton gin, machine building factories; building construction amalgamate; food (milling, baking, and meat packing amalgamates, dairy plant, etc.), leather industry, carpet production. Near to Mary began to operate in 1973 the Mary District State Electrical Power Plant. Medical and pedagogical colleges. Museum of history of the revolution.  Drama theater.<ref name=bse>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://bse.slovaronline.com/18666-MARY |script-article=ru:МАРЫ|script-title=ru:Большая советская энциклопедия|edition=3rd|language=ru}} (online version)</ref>}}

In 1968, huge reserves of [[natural gas]] were discovered 20 kilometers west of the city in the [[Shatlyk Gas Field]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pdfio.com/k-251915.html|title=Petroleum Geology and Resources of the Amu-Darya Basin|year=2004|publisher=pdfio.com|access-date=2014-05-05|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140505213018/http://www.pdfio.com/k-251915.html|archive-date=2014-05-05}}</ref>

Mary became the center of [[Mary Province]] on 18 May 1992, after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the [[Turkmenistan|Turkmen]] proclamation of independence.

In the 2000s, many streets and new residential areas were built. The [[Mary Airport|new airport terminal]] was constructed, as was a new building for the [[Turkmen State Power Engineering Institute]], a theater, the new [[Mary Library|library]], a new [[Mary Museum|historical museum]], the Palace of Spirituality ({{lang-tk|Ruhiýet Köşgi}}), the Margush Hotel, a medical diagnostic center, the Ene Mähri obstetric-pediatric medical center, the [[Gurbanguly Hajji Mosque]], a stadium, an equestrian complex, an indoor swimming pool, and a new railway station.<ref>[http://www.turkmenistan.gov.tm/?id=1587 "Гостеприимство древнего и вечно юного города"] {{in lang|ru}}</ref>

In 2012, the city was declared one of the cultural capitals of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]].<ref>[http://www.turkmenistan.ru/ru/articles/37338.html "Туркменский город Мары получил сертификат культурной столицы СНГ"] {{in lang|ru}}</ref>
