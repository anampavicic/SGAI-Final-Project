The '''canton of Bern''', or '''Berne''' ({{langx|de|Kanton Bern}}; {{langx|fr|canton de Berne}}; {{langx|rm|Chantun Berna}}; {{langx|it|Canton Berna}}), is one of the [[Canton of Switzerland|26 cantons]] forming the [[Switzerland|Swiss Confederation]]. Its capital city, [[Bern]], is also the ''de facto'' capital of Switzerland. The bear is the heraldic symbol of the canton, displayed on a red-yellow background.

Comprising [[Subdivisions of the canton of Bern|ten districts]], Bern is the second-largest canton by both surface area and population. Located in west-central Switzerland, it is surrounded by eleven cantons. It borders the cantons of [[canton of Jura|Jura]] and [[canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]] to the north. To the west lie the cantons of [[canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]], [[canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]], and [[canton of Vaud|Vaud]]. To the south lies the cantons of [[canton of Valais|Valais]]. East of the canton of Bern lie the cantons of [[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Canton of Nidwalden|Nidwalden]], [[Canton of Obwalden|Obwalden]], [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]] and [[Canton of Aargau|Aargau]]. The geography of the canton includes a large share of all three natural regions of Switzerland: the [[Jura Mountains]] (the [[Bernese Jura]]), the [[Swiss Plateau]] (the Bernese Mittelland) and the [[Alps]] (the [[Bernese Oberland]]).

The canton of Bern is [[bilingual]], officially [[German language|German]]- and [[French language|French]]-speaking, and has a population (as of {{Swiss populations date|CH-BE}}) of {{Swiss populations|CH-BE|CH-BE}}.{{Swiss populations ref|CH-BE}} The largest city, Bern, is also the seat of the federal government of Switzerland. Other major cities are [[Thun]] and [[Biel/Bienne]]. The canton is also renowned for its numerous Alpine resort towns, notably [[Interlaken]] and [[Gstaad]].

Formerly part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the canton of Bern entered an alliance with the Swiss Forest Cantons in 1323 and joined the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] in 1353.

==History==<!-- This section is linked from [[House of Savoy]] -->
{{see also|History of Bern|Coat of arms of Bern|List of cultural property of national significance in Switzerland: Bern}}
Bern joined the [[Old Swiss Confederation]] in 1353. Between 1803 and 1814 it was one of the six ''directorial cantons'' of the [[Swiss Confederation (Napoleonic)|Napoleonic Swiss Confederation]].

===Early prehistory===
The earliest traces of a human presence in the area of the modern Canton is found in three caves in the [[Simmental]] region; Schnurenloch near [[Oberwil im Simmental|Oberwil]], Ranggiloch above [[Boltigen]] and Chilchlihöhle above [[Erlenbach im Simmental|Erlenbach]]. These caves were used at various times during the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]]. The first open-air settlement in the area is an upper [[paleolithic]] settlement at Moosbühl in Moosseedorf. During the warmer climate of the [[mesolithic]] period, increasing forest cover restricted the movement of hunters, fishers and gatherers. Their temporary settlements were built along lake and marsh edges, which remained free of trees due to fluctuations in water level. Important mesolithic sites in the Canton are at Pieterlenmoos and Burgäschisee lake along with alpine valleys at Diemtig and Simmental. During the [[neolithic]] period, there were a number of settlements on the shores of [[Lake Biel]], the Toteisbecken (Lobsigensee, Moossee, Burgäschisee and Inkwilersee) and along rivers ([[Aare]], [[Zihl]]).<ref name="HDS">{{HDS|7383|Canton of Bern}}</ref> Several of these sites are part of the [[Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps]], a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref name="UNESCO">{{Cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1363/ |title=Prehistoric Pile Dwellings around the Alps |first=UNESCO World Heritage |last=Centre |website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}</ref>

One of the best explored neolithic sites is at [[Twann]] (now [[Twann-Tüscherz]]). In the Twannbach delta there were about 25 [[Cortaillod culture]] and [[Horgen culture]] villages that existed between 3800 and 2950 BC. One of the oldest examples of bread from Switzerland, a [[sourdough]] from 3560 to 3530 BC, came from one of these villages.<ref name="HDS" /> A preserved [[Bronze Age]] [[dugout boat]] has been found on the dried out lake bed, it was part of lake village near Twann, a stone-lined [[well]] had been dug near the preserved boat in 1874.<ref>{{cite book | author1=Martin Oswald Hugh Carver |title=Making Archaeology Happen: Design Versus Dogma |publisher= Taylor & Francis |year=2016 |page=43 |isbn=9781315425047 }}</ref>

===Iron Age===
[[File:Brenodor.jpg|thumb|Helveto-Roman settlement Bern-Engehalbinsel]]
During the [[Early Iron Age]] changes in climate forced the [[Hallstatt culture]] (800–450 BCE) to abandon settlements along many waterways and in the valley floors and move to the plateaus and hills. With increased trade contacts across the Alps, the cultural influence of the [[Mediterranean region]] grew in the area. Evidence of this trade include a [[hydria]] which was discovered in Grächwil. Burial rituals and social classes became more developed during this time. The so-called ''princely graves'' became more common, many of the burial mounds were over {{cvt|30|m|ft}} in diameter and {{cvt|4|m|ft}} high and richly outfitted with grave goods. In a grave mound in Bützberg the first burial in the mound was followed by several later burials. Often, several grave mounds combined to become a necropolis, such as at [[Grossaffoltern]], [[Ins, Switzerland|Ins]], [[Bannwil]], [[Langenthal]] and Bützberg. Most of the knowledge about the Hallstatt culture in the Canton comes from graves. The only discovered settlement is around Blanche Church in [[La Neuveville]].

The grave goods show that iron was forged into swords, daggers, spearheads, knives and wagon accessories. Gold, which was probably collected from river sand, was made into diadems, rings and pendants. Thin bronze arm, leg and neck plates with geometric designs were often buried, especially in the graves at Allenlüften in Mühleberg, at Ins and at Bützberg. The jewelry that was buried included bracelets and rings which were also made of [[Jet (lignite)|jet]] and [[lignite]] coal. At Münchringen, the grave pottery was both shaped by hand or thrown on a potter's wheel, and was painted with multi-colored ornamentation.

The transition to the [[Late Iron Age]] of the [[La Tène culture]] (450−1st century BCE) is indicated by a sudden change of style in the metalworking and ceramic industries. Numerous graves (from unknown settlements), along with the two ''[[oppida]]'' at Bern-Engehalbinsel and Jensberg by [[Studen, Bern|Studen]], mark the population centers during the late [[Iron Age]]. Gold coins (from [[Melchnau]]) along with silver and bronze coins first start to appear during this era. A sword with [[Greek alphabet|Greek characters]] that said ''Korisios'' was found at the Port site. At the [[oppidum]] at Bern-Engehalbinsel, there were studios for glass and ceramic production, and iron working achieved a high level of skill, along with craftsmen who worked in wood, leather and goldsmithing. There was a nearby place of worship in the Bremgarten wood, and cemeteries at [[Münsingen]] and Bern-Engehalbinsel.<ref name="HDS" />

===Roman era===
[[File:Engehalbinsel Römerbad1.jpg|thumb|Baths at Engehalbinsel near Bern]]
{{More|Switzerland in the Roman era}}
After the [[Switzerland in the Roman era|Roman era]] victory at [[Battle of Bibracte]] in 58 BCE, the [[Helvetii]] were forced to return to their homes as [[foederati]] of the Romans. Under increasing Roman influence, the local economy and trade flourished. The main settlements lay at the foot of the [[Jura Mountains]] and on the [[Central Plateau (Switzerland)|Central Plateau]].

The existing roads were expanded, especially the [[Aventicum]]-[[Vindonissa]] and the [[Petinesca]]-[[Augusta Raurica]] roads. A fourth alpine pass, the [[Rawil Pass|Rawil pass]], was added to the traditional three; the [[Grimsel pass|Grimsel]], [[Brünig pass|Brünig]] and [[Susten pass|Susten]] passes. In the Bernese Jura the [[Mont Raimeux]] and [[Col de Pierre Pertuis|Pierre Pertuis]] passes opened.

Under the Romans, many of the old fortified places were expanded and refortified. The old Helvetii oppidum at the Engehalbinsel became a Roman [[vicus]], which was probably known as Brenodor or Brenodurum. At the foot of the Jens mountain, the fort Petinesca was built to guard the roads over the Jura Mountains. This was reinforced in the late-Roman era (368–369 CE) by a fortified bridge over the [[Thielle|Thielle/Zihl]] river between Aegerten and Brügg.

A number of Roman villas were built around the Canton. At [[Wichtrach|Oberwichtrach]] both the main building (''pars urbana'') and the industrial section (''pars rustica'') of a Roman villa have been discovered. The villas at Münsingen, [[Toffen]] and [[Herzogenbuchsee]] have richly detailed [[Roman mosaic]]s that are still partly visible.

The religious practices of the local population merged with Roman beliefs and the Canton of Bern is home to a number of unique cult centers. They include the larger than life statues of gods (including enthroned Jupiter) at Petinesca, Engehalbinsel, and Thun-Allmendingen; and a number of stone inscriptions. At the beginning of the 5th century CE, Rome withdrew its troops from the Rhine garrisons, but allowed the [[Burgundians]] to settle on Helvetii lands in 443 CE.<ref name="HDS" />

===Early Middle Ages===
[[File:Map Burgundian Kingdom 2 EN.png|thumb|Burgundian and Allamanni lands between 534 and 843]]
East of the [[Aare]], the transition from the Gallo-Roman dominated population to a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] population in the [[Early Middle Ages]] happened relatively peacefully. One exception was the Battle of Wangen in 610, but elsewhere it generally was a slow process of cultural infiltration. By the 7th century, the [[Alamanni]]c settlers had already taken most of the good locations southeast of the Aare and they began moving up the Aare to the regions of Lake Thun and [[Lake Brienz]]. All areas west of the Aare belonged to the romanised Burgundian kingdom, which became part of the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Franks|Frankish]] kingdom in the 534. During the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian era]], the political structure of the Franks had spread into parts of what became Switzerland. In 762/778 the County of Aargau was founded, followed in 861 by the County of Oberaargau and in 965 the County of Bargen. The [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843 put the border between Central and Eastern Frankish Empires at the Aare, and divided the Aare region in half. The population west of the Aare generally spoke a [[Romance language]], while those to the east spoke a [[Germanic language]]. The region between the rivers Saane and Aare became the language border.

Christianity spread slowly into the Aare valley. The dioceses of [[Bishop of Lausanne|Lausanne]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Basel|Basel]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sion|Sion]], [[Bishop of Chur|Chur]] and [[Bishopric of Constance|Constance]] were all established before the new faith made inroads into the valley. The Aare valley was bordered by three dioceses; Lausanne, Constance and Basel. However, the first Christian missionaries came into the valley from [[Alsace]] and other western areas. In 630 the [[Abbey of Luxeuil]] established the Abbey of [[Moutier-Grandval]] along the old transit route through the Pierre Pertuis Pass. By the 9th or 10th century, this abbey had property and influence all the way to Lake Biel and into the Balsthal valley. The first monastic cells of what would become the Abbey of [[Saint-Imier]] was also founded in 600. In the Seeland and Aare valleys, wooden churches were first built during the Merovingian period. The current churches in Kirchlindach, Oberwil bei Buren and Bleibach were all built above the ruins of these early churches. About 30 churches in the Bern and Solothurn portions of the Aare valley were created over ruins of Roman villas and subsequent burial grounds in the 7th century (including Meikirch and Oberbipp). In Mett, the church was built over a 5th-century mausoleum, which was built over a 4th-century tomb. In 700, six sarcophagi were buried on [[St. Petersinsel|St. Peter's Island]] next to a Roman temple complex. A wooden monastery was built over the complex in the 8th–9th century.<ref name="HDS" />

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Schweiz um 1200.png|thumb|Lands held by the main noble families around 1200]]
{{More|Medieval Switzerland}}
During the 10th century, the Aare valley came fully under the [[Second Kingdom of Burgundy#Second Kingdom of Burgundy|Second Kingdom of Burgundy]]. Under King [[Rudolph I of Burgundy|Rudolph I]] and his son [[Rudolph II of Burgundy|Rudolph II]] Burgundy's influence reached across most of modern Switzerland. They established royal courts at Bümpliz, Münsingen, Uetendorf, Wimmis, Kirchberg and Utzenstorf to allow them to govern the Aare valley. Later, the Aare valley moved toward closer ties with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] during the [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] and [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] dynasties.

The succession dispute following the death of [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] in 1032 allowed the Salian kings to acquire the Kingdom of Upper Burgundy and with it the Aare valley. As a part of the Holy Roman Empire, the valley was involved when the [[Investiture Controversy]] broke out in 1056. In 1077, the Regent of Burgundy, Count [[Rudolf of Rheinfelden]], declared himself as an anti-king against King [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]]. The Bishops of Basel and Lausanne remained loyal to King Henry IV, and took the Rheinfelden lands in Oberaargau and the upper Aare valley. After Rudolf's death in 1090, his lands went to his son, [[Berchtold II of Zähringen]]. He and his son, Berchtold III, tried to use these lands to expand their power. In 1127 the [[Zähringer]] were appointed Rector or delegate of the king in Burgundy. Their hopes for a new, independent Burgundy were dashed in 1156, and the last Zähringen count, Berchtold V, embarked on a program of city founding. The cities of [[Burgdorf, Switzerland|Burgdorf]], [[Murten]], [[Thun]] and Bern were all founded by Berchtold V. When he died without an heir, the Zähringen lands went to the [[House of Kyburg]], while the offices and [[fief]]s reverted to the empire.<ref name="HDS" />

During the [[High Middle Ages]] both the Aare valley and the [[Bernese Oberland]] were divided into a number of small counties, each with their own [[baron]]. Nobles from the Holy Roman Empire began to marry into the local noble families and a number of the Zähringen [[Ministerialis]] families (unfree knights in the service of a [[feudal]] overlord) moved into the Oberland. The nobles also began to found monasteries to spread their power into the Oberland. During the period between 1070 and 1150, at least ten large monasteries were founded by local nobles. These include; the [[Cluny Abbey|Cluniac]] [[Priory]] of [[Rüeggisberg Priory|Rüeggisberg]] (Lords of Rümligen in 1072), Münchenwiler (Wiler family in 1080), [[St. Petersinsel|St. Peter's Island]] (Count of Hochburgund-Mâcon in the late 11th century), Hettiswil (1107), Röthenbach im Emmental (Lords of Rümligen or Signau), the [[Benedictine]] monastery at [[Erlach Abbey|St. Johannsen]] in Erlach (Fenis family in 1100), Trub (Lords of Lützelflüh before 1130) and Rüegsau (possibly also the Lords of Lützelflüh in first half of the 12th century), the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[Collegiate church]] in Interlaken (Oberhofen family in 1130) and the [[Cistercian]] [[Frienisberg Abbey]] (Count Saugern around 1130). However, in 1191 the Oberland barons revolted against Berchtold V of Zähringen and many of the Oberland barons were killed in the battle of Grindelwald.

During the 13th century a number of the cities near Bern were granted the [[city right]] and appointed mayors and city councils. Bern became an [[Free imperial city|imperial city]]. During the mid-13th century, the Empire's presence weakened in the Aare valley, forcing the local nobles to find allies to protect themselves. Bern entered into a number of treaties with its neighbors in the 13th century. In 1274, the Emperor [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph I of Habsburg]], confirmed Bern's imperial immediacy. However, in 1285 he imposed an imperial tax which drove the city to support Rudolph's enemies. Although it withstood two sieges by the Emperor in 1288, after the defeat at Schosshalde in 1289 it had to pay taxes and a penalty.

In 1298 Bernese forces won a victory at [[Oberwangen (Köniz)|Oberwangen]] in [[Köniz]] against the [[County of Savoy]] and the Habsburg Austrian nobility. In 1300, the city acquired the four surrounding parishes of Bolligen, Vechigen, Stettlen and Muri, destroyed the threatening castles of Bremgarten and Belp and gave the Baron of Montenach Bernese citizenship. After the victory of [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV of Bavaria]] over the Habsburg [[Frederick the Fair]] in the battle of Mühldorf (Bavaria) in 1322, Bern entered an alliance with the anti-Habsburg Swiss [[Waldstätte|Forest Cantons]] in 1323.

{{Main|Old Swiss Confederacy}}
Bern joined the [[Old Swiss Confederation]] in 1353.

====14th century====
In 1310 [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry VII]] [[Pledge (law)|pledged]] [[Laupen Castle]], [[Laupen]] and the surrounding lands as collateral for a loan. In 1324, Bern acquired the pledged castle and lands. When the Emperor was unable to repay the loan, Laupen became the first [[bailiwick]] of Bern.<ref name="HDS_Laupen">{{HDS|8447|Laupen}}</ref>

In 1322, the brothers Eberhard II of [[House of Kyburg#Neu-Kyburg|Neu-Kyburg]] and Hartmann II of Neu-Kyburg started fighting with each other over who would inherit the family's lands around Thun. The fighting led to the "[[fratricide]] at [[Thun Castle]]" where Eberhard killed his brother Hartmann. To avoid punishment by his Habsburg overlords, Eberhard fled to [[Bern]]. In the following year, he sold the town of [[Thun]], its castle and the land surrounding Thun to Bern. Bern then granted the land back to Eberhard as a [[fief]].<ref name="HDS Kyburg">{{HDS|19520<!--Section 1-1-->|von Kyburg}}</ref> Bern's support of Eberhard, their resulting expansion into the Oberland and their alliance with the Forest Cantons brought the city into conflict with the Habsburgs during the 14th century. The [[Gümmenenkrieg]] in 1333 between Bern and [[Fribourg]] over rights and influence in the [[Sense District|Sense/Singine]] area ended without resolving anything.

In 1334, Bern fought with the Barons of Weissenburg and occupied [[Wimmis]] and [[Unspunnen Castle|Unspunnen]] in the Oberland. Bern's victory allowed them to bring the [[Oberhasli]] region, its capital of [[Meiringen]] and Weissenburg under their control. Bern's continued expansion was at the expense of the feudal lords in the surrounding lands. In 1339 the Habsburgs, Kyburgs and Fribourg, marched against Bern with 17,000 men and besieged the border town of Laupen. To raise the siege, Bern raised a force of 6,000, consisting of Bernese, supported by the Forest Cantons, and other allies ([[Simmental]], Weissenbur and Oberhasli).<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of the Art of War in the Middle Ages Vol.2 |last=Oman |first=Charles |author-link=Charles Oman|orig-date= 1924 |year=1991 |publisher=Greenhill |location=London |isbn=1-85367-105-3 |pages=241–5}}</ref> The allied Bernese forces were victorious at the [[Battle of Laupen]] and Bern drew closer to the Swiss Forest Cantons. It entered into a permanent or eternal alliance with Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden in 1353. This date is usually considered the date of Bern's entrance into the Swiss Confederation; however, the alliance only indirectly tied Bern to Zürich and Lucerne.

In 1358 the cash-strapped Count Peter II of Aarberg pawned the County of [[Aarberg]] to Bern. However, in 1367 he sold it, without repaying Bern, to his cousin Rudolf IV of Nidau. After Rudolf's death (1375) Bern acquired clear right to the Aarberg lands from the other heirs.<ref>{{HDS|8434|Aarberg (Herrschaft, Amtsbezirk)}}</ref>

Throughout the 14th century, Bern entered into alliances and treaties with many of its neighbors, including members of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederation]]. Bern entered into a series of agreements with [[Biel/Bienne]], which led to a conflict with Biel's ruler, [[Jean de Vienne (archbishop, died 1382)|Jean de Vienne]], the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Basel|Prince-Bishop of Basel]], in 1367–68. The bishop marched south and destroyed Biel along with a number of towns in the southern [[Jura Mountains]]. During the [[Gugler|Gugler war]] in 1375, there were several battles between Bernese troops and English mercenaries under [[Enguerrand VII, Lord of Coucy|Enguerrand de Coucy]].

By the 1370s, the Kyburgs (which still held Thun as a fief for Bern) were deeply in debt to Bern. On 11 November 1382, Rudolf II of Neu-Kyburg made an unsuccessful raid on [[Solothurn]]. The ensuing conflict with the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] (known as the ''[[Burgdorferkrieg]]'' or ''Kyburgerkrieg'') allowed Bern to move against the Habsburgs in Aargau. After the Bernese laid siege to Burgdorf, Neu-Kyburg was forced to concede an unfavourable peace.<ref>{{HDS|8733|Burgdorferkrieg}}</ref> Bern bought Thun and Burgdorf, the most important cities of Neu-Kyburg, and their remaining towns passed to Bern and Solothurn by 1408. The last of the Neu-Kyburgs, Berchtold, died destitute in Bern in 1417.<ref name="HDS Kyburg" />

In 1386, the [[Archduchy of Austria|Austrians]] under [[Leopold III, Duke of Austria|Leopold of Habsburg]] invaded eastern Switzerland. When they besieged the city of [[Sempach]], troops from Zürich, Lucerne and the Forest Cantons marched out and defeated the Austrians at the [[Battle of Sempach]]. While Bern was not involved at Sempach they took advantage of the Austrian weakness to march into the Oberland in 1386, followed by the [[Seeland (Switzerland)|Seeland]] (the region south of the Jura Mountains containing the [[lake Murten|Morat (Murten)]], [[Lake of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]] and [[Lake of Biel|Bienne (Biel)]] lakes) in 1388 and the [[Aargau]] in 1389. In the peace agreement of 1389 Bern got [[Unterseen]] and the Upper Simme valley ([[Simmental]]) from the Habsburgs. In the same year, Fribourg accepted Berns acquisition of the Iselgaus, i.e. the area between Lake Biel and the Seeland. Over the next several decades Bern continued to expand to the detriment of the Habsburgs and Fribourg. They acquired the following towns: 1391 Simmenegg, 1399 [[Signau]], 1400 [[Frutigen]], 1407 [[Wangen an der Aare|Wangen]], 1408 [[Trachselwald]] and [[Huttwil]], 1412 Oltigen and in 1413 (together with Solothurn) Bipp and Bechburg.<ref name="HDS" />

====15th century====
By 1400, Bern controlled the entire Bernese Oberland. Under their control, the five valleys of the Oberland enjoyed extensive rights and far-reaching autonomy in the [[Bäuert]]en (farming cooperative municipalities) and ''Talverbänden'' (rural alpine communities). However, throughout the Late Middle Ages, the Oberland, as a whole or in part, revolted several times against Bernese authority. The Evil League (''Böser Bund'') in 1445 fought against Bernese military service and taxes following the [[Old Zürich War]],<ref name="HDS_BB">{{HDS|26842|Böser Bund in Berner Oberland}}</ref> in 1528 the Oberland rose up in resistance to the Protestant [[Reformation]] and in 1641 [[Thun]] revolted.<ref name="HDS_BO">{{HDS|10296|Bernese Oberland}}</ref>

In the Bernese Oberland during the 13th and the beginning of the 14th century [[Interlaken Monastery]] grew to become the largest landholder in the region. The Monastery controlled the towns of [[Grindelwald]], [[Lauterbrunnen]] and numerous farms along [[Lake Brienz]]. However, in 1350 a period of crises and conflicts led to a decline in the number of monks and nuns and increasing debt. In 1348, the people of [[Grindelwald]] and [[Wilderswil]] joined a mutual defense league with [[Unterwalden]]. Bern responded with a military expedition to the [[Bernese Oberland]], which ended in defeat for Unterwalden and its allies. By 1472, Bern was the patron of the Monastery. During the Protestant [[Reformation]], the Monastery was secularized in 1528. The [[Canon (priest)|canons]] received a financial settlement and the properties were now managed by a Bernese [[bailiff]]. The tenants of the Monastery who had expected the abolition of all owed debts, responded by rioting, which was suppressed by Bern.<ref name="HDS_Monastery">{{HDS|8506|Interlaken Monastery and District}}</ref>

[[File:Karte Kanton Waadt Bezirke 2022.png|thumb|Map of the modern Canton of Vaud, which was annexed by Bern from 1536 until 1798]]
The lands around the northern shore of [[Lake Geneva]] and between [[Lake Neuchâtel]] were the next area into which Bern expanded. The region had originally been part of the [[Carolingian Empire]]. Then, in 1032 the Zähringens of Germany defeated the Burgundians, who were then replaced by the counts of [[Savoy]] in 1218. Under the counts of Savoy the area was given political unity, and established as the [[Barony of Vaud]]. However, as the power of the Savoys declined at the beginning of the 15th century the land was occupied by troops from [[Bern]]. By 1536 the area was completely annexed. Reformation was started by co-workers of [[John Calvin]], including [[Pierre Viret|Viret]], who engaged in a famous debate at the cathedral of Lausanne; but it was only decisively implemented when Bern put its full force behind it. Vaud was another French-speaking region in the mostly German-speaking canton, which caused several uprisings.

Both Château-d'Œx and Saanen were part of the county of [[Gruyères|Gruyère]]. Both districts had quite a bit of independence and often entered into treaties against the will and best interests of the Counts. In 1340 the Saanen valley concluded a peace treaty with the [[Simmental]], which provided for arbitration in disputes. They entered into another treaty in 1393 with the Valais. In 1401, Count Rudolph of Gruyère entered into a treaty with Bern which included Saanen. Two years later Saanen<ref name="HDS_SD" /> and Château-d'Œx<ref name="HDS_CDO">{{HDS|2593|Château-d'Oex}}</ref> negotiated their own alliances with Bern. Due to the Bernese alliance, Saanen sent troops, under their own banner, to support the Bernese invasions of Aargau in 1415 and Valais in 1418. The military losses and taxes following the Old Zürich War led Saanen to support the Evil League (''Böser Bund'') in 1445 against Bern.

[[File:Belagerung Grandson.jpg|thumb|left|Siege and execution of the garrison at Grandson]]
In 1475, during the [[Burgundian Wars]], the mountain regions of [[Saanen]] and [[Pays-d'Enhaut District|Pays-d'Enhaut]], who were allied with Bern, attacked and burned the tower of [[Aigle Castle]]. They then gave [[Aigle]] town and the surrounding district to Bern in exchange for not having to pay one-third of their income to Bern. In the treaty of Fribourg from 1476, Fribourg received rights over the Aigle district, which they gave up to Bern in 1483. Bern rebuilt Aigle Castle in 1489 and made it the seat of the [[bailiwick]] of Aigle.<ref name="HDS_Aigle">{{HDS|2276|Aigle}}</ref> Also in 1475, the Confederation attacked and captured [[Grandson Castle]]. In the next year, [[Charles the Bold]] retook the castle and executed the Bernese garrison. In 1476, at the [[Battle of Grandson]], Charles' forces retreated and the Bernese retook Grandson. After Charles' defeat at the [[Battle of Murten]], Grandson became a shared territory between Bern and Fribourg. Each city appointed a [[vogt]] for five-year periods.<ref name="HDS_Grandson_District">{{HDS|7574|Grandson district}}</ref> Aigle and Grandson were the first French speaking regions in the Canton of Bern.

During the Burgundian War in 1475, Saanen, together with troops from Château-d'Œx and the Simmental captured the Savoy district of Aigle for Bern. Saanen and the surrounding district enjoyed a great deal of independence during the 16th century. However, in 1555 the last [[County of Gruyère|Count of Gruyère]] lost both districts to Bern when his county went bankrupt. Bern took over the entire Saanen valley in the following year and introduced the Protestant Reformation.<ref name="HDS_SD">{{HDS|8508|Saanen district}}</ref> They incorporated the [[Pays-d'Enhaut]] with Château-d'Œx into the new Bernese district of Saanen.<ref name="HDS_CDO" />

====Acquired districts====
The area of the canton of Bern consists of lands acquired by the city of Bern mostly between the 14th and the 16th century during the original [[Old Swiss Confederation|Swiss Confederacy period]], both by conquest and purchase.<br />Acquired districts, with dates of acquisition, include:
*[[Laupen]] (1324)
*[[Oberhasli]] (1334)
*Aarberg (1375)
*Thun and Burgdorf (1384)

*[[Vaud]] (1536)
*[[Saanen]] or Gessenay (1555)
*the ''Pays d'En-Haut'' including [[Château-d'Œx]] (1555)
*[[Köniz]] (1729).

===Social changes in Early Modern Bern===
{{More|Early Modern Switzerland}}
In the Middle Ages, upwards mobility and access to public offices was relatively easy for successful traders and craftsmen, but Bernese society became ever more stratified and aristocratic as the power and wealth of the city grew.

By the 17th century in the [[Early Modern Switzerland|Early Modern period]], citizenship had become an inherited prerogative, all political bodies elected one another and officials were elected for life.<ref name="HDS" /> In effect, public offices were now the exclusive prerogative of the ''gnädige Herren'', the "merciful lords", as the small number of noble families now ruling Bern came to be called. In 1605 there were 152 families that were qualified to rule, by 1691 that number was only 104, while towards the end of the 18th century there were only 69 such families. Meanwhile, the land ruled by the town was extending over more and more territory, so that finally it governed 52 bailiwicks.<ref name="EB">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Bern (city)|display=Bern|volume=3|page=795|first=Rev. William Augustus Brevoort|last=Coolidge |author-link=W. A. B. Coolidge}}</ref> These offices became very lucrative as the Bernese territories grew. Patrician ''Landvögte'', [[sheriff]]s, ruled the politically powerless countryside, often using armed force to put down [[popular revolt in late medieval Europe|peasant revolts]].

In Vaud the Bernese occupation was not popular amongst the population. In 1723, Major [[Abraham Davel]] led a revolt against Bern, in protest at what he saw as the denial of political rights of the French-speaking Vaudois by the German-speaking Bernese, and was subsequently beheaded.<ref name="HistoiredelaSuisse">''Histoire de la Suisse'', Éditions Fragnière, Fribourg, Switzerland.</ref>

===Napoleonic period===
[[File:Karte Helvetik 3.png|thumb|The Helvetic Republic from 1798 to 1801]]
{{More|Helvetic Republic|Swiss Confederation (Napoleonic)}}
Inspired by the [[French Revolution]], the Vaudois drove out the Bernese governor in 1798 and declared the [[Lemanic Republic]]. Vaud nationalists like [[Frédéric-César de La Harpe]] had called for French intervention in liberating the area and French Revolutionary troops moved in, taking over the whole of Switzerland itself in the process and setting up the [[Helvetic Republic]].

In 1798, with the establishment of the Helvetic Republic, Bern was divided, the [[canton of Oberland]] with [[Thun]] as its capital and the [[canton of Léman]] with [[Lausanne]] as its capital were detached from what was left of the Canton of Bern.

Within the new canton of Oberland, historic borders and traditional rights were not considered. As there had been no previous separatist feeling amongst the conservative population, there was little enthusiasm for the new order.<ref name="HDS_BO" /> The situation in the canton of Léman was quite different. The French-speaking Vaudois had never felt like part of the German-speaking Canton of Bern. When they joined the Swiss Confederation in 1803, it was as the Canton of Vaud.

Under the Helvetic Republic, Pays-d'Enhaut with Château-d'Œx became part of the [[Canton of Léman]] while Saanen and the rest of the district became part of the [[Canton of Oberland]]. When the Helvetic Republic collapsed in 1803, Saanen and its district became a district in the new Canton of Bern<ref name="HDS_SD" /> while Château-d'Oex and its district joined Vaud.

The 1801 [[Malmaison Constitution]] proposed reuniting the Oberland with Bern, but it was not until the [[Act of Mediation]], two years later, with the abolition of the Helvetic Republic and the partial restoration of the [[Ancien Régime of Switzerland|''ancien régime'']], that the two cantons were reunited.<ref name="HDS_Oberland">{{HDS|8633|Canton of Oberland}}</ref>

Between 1803 and 1814 Bern was one of the six ''directorial cantons'' of the [[Swiss Confederation (Napoleonic)|Napoleonic Swiss Confederation]].

===Modern history===
{{further|Jura separatism}}
With the post−Napoleonic [[Restoration (Switzerland)|Restoration of 1815]], Bern acquired the [[Bernese Jura]] with [[Biel/Bienne]] from the [[bishopric of Basel]], while the canton of Léman became the [[canton of Vaud]] and remained separate from Bern.

Bern still remained the largest canton of the confederacy from 1815 to 1979, when parts of the Bernese Jura broke away to form the [[canton of Jura]]. In 1994 the [[Laufen District]] was transferred to the [[canton of Basel-Landschaft]].

==Geography==
[[File:Bernese Alps from Chasseral.jpg|thumb|View from the [[Chasseral]] across the Mittelland to the [[Bernese Alps]]]]
The canton of Bern is mainly drained by the river [[Aare]] and its tributaries. The area of the canton is commonly divided into six regions.<ref>[http://www.vol.be.ch/site/wkb/wkb-regionen.htm Kanton Bern, Regionen] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101070657/http://www.vol.be.ch/site/wkb/wkb-regionen.htm |date=1 January 2009 }} (german). Retrieved 30 July 2009</ref> The most populated area is the [[Bernese Mittelland]] on the plateau north of the Alps, with the capital city of Bern. The northmost part of the canton is the [[Bernese Jura]] bordering the [[Canton of Jura]]. The [[Bernese Oberland]] is the mountainous region which lies in the south of the canton.

The area of the canton is {{cvt|5959|km2|mi2}}. Of this area, 6.9% is occupied with houses, businesses or roads. 42.6% of the canton is agricultural land, and 31.3% is forested. Less than 19.2% is considered non-productive, which includes glaciers, cliffs and lakes.<ref name="BFS Canton">[https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics/regional-statistics/regional-portraits-key-figures/cantons/bern.html Swiss Federal Statistical Office] – Key Data. Retrieved 18 August 2020</ref>

=== Bernese Mittelland ===
{{main|Bernese Mittelland}}
{{see also|Swiss Plateau}}
The Bernese Mittelland (Bernese Midlands) is made up of the valley of the rivers Aare, the [[Emme (river)|(Grosse) Emme]], some of the foothills of the Bernese Alps, as well as the plain around the capital Bern, and has many small farms and hilly forested regions with small to mid-sized towns scattered throughout. It is perhaps best known by foreigners and visitors for the [[Emmental]]. The classic Swiss cheese with holes [[Emmentaler]] comes from this region's forests and pastures, of hilly and low mountainous countryside in the {{cvt|1000|to|2000|m|ft}} range.

=== Three Lakes Region and Bernese Jura ===
In the north of the canton lies the predominantly French-speaking Three Lakes Region ([[Seeland (Switzerland)|Seeland]]), concentrated around [[Lake Biel]], [[Lake Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]], and [[Lake Murten|Murten]], which rises from the plain up to the northernmost Swiss mountain chain of the [[Jura mountains|Jura]]. This area, culminating at the [[Chasseral]], has more relaxed geography, although still some lower mountains and some waterfalls, and large lakes.

=== Bernese Oberland ===
[[File:Lauterbrunnen - Staubbachfall.jpg|thumb|[[Staubbachfall]]]]
{{see also|Swiss Alps}}
The Bernese Oberland ({{langx|de|link=no|Berner Oberland}}) constitute the north side of the [[Bernese Alps]] and the west side of the [[Urner Alps]] within the canton of Bern. The highest mountain in the Bernese Alps is the [[Finsteraarhorn]] at {{cvt|4274|m|ft}}, but the best known mountains are [[Eiger]], [[Mönch]], and [[Jungfrau]].

The well known hiking and ski resorts in the eastern Oberland are located around [[Interlaken]] and the Jungfrau, such as car-free [[Mürren]] and [[Wengen]] in the [[Lauterbrunnen]] valley, and [[Grindelwald]]. Further east, in the [[Haslital]] are the [[Aareschlucht]] and the town of [[Meiringen]], famous for the fateful scene of [[Sherlock Holmes]]'s 'death' at the hands of [[Professor Moriarty]] on the nearby [[Reichenbach Falls]]. In the Western Bernese Oberland there are many other resorts and small villages catering to visitors. These are accessed from the lake town of [[Thun]], and the most notable of them are [[Kandersteg]] with the [[Oeschinensee]] and [[Adelboden]]. Further west is the [[Simmental]] with [[Lenk]] and [[Zweisimmen]] and the Saanenland with the famous resorts [[Gstaad]] and [[Saanen]].

The whole area is very mountainous, with steep cliffs, many glaciers, and countless waterfalls. It is renowned for its scenic beauty and the charm of the small Swiss villages that dot the area. As a result of this, tourism is one of the main sources of income in the Bernese Oberland. The region also has an extensive train network as well as many [[Aerial lift|cable cars]] and [[funicular]]s, with the highest train station in Europe at the [[Jungfraujoch]] and the longest [[Gondelbahn Grindelwald-Männlichen|gondola cableway]] in the world from Grindelwald to the [[Männlichen]].

Mountains in the Bernese Oberland include:

The [[Grand Council of Bern]] ({{langx|de|link=no|Grosser Rat}}/{{langx|fr|link=no|Grand conseil}}) is the parliament of the canton of Bern. It consists of 160 representatives elected by [[proportional representation]] for four-year terms of office. The French-speaking part of the canton, the [[Bernese Jura]], has 12 seats guaranteed and 3 seats are guaranteed for the French-speaking minority of the bilingual district of Biel/Bienne.

The [[Executive Council of Bern]] ({{langx|de|link=no|Regierungsrat}}/{{langx|fr|link=no|Conseil-éxecutif}}) is the [[Executive (government)|government]] of the canton of Bern. This seven-member collegial body is elected by the people for a period of four years. The cantonal constitution reserves one seat in the Executive Council for a French-speaking citizen from the Bernese Jura.

The canton has a two-tiered court system, consisting of district courts and a cantonal Supreme Court ({{langx|de|link=no|Obergericht}}, {{langx|fr|link=no|Cour suprême}}).

==Coat of arms==
{{Main|Coat of arms of Bern}}
The [[blazon]] of the [[coat of arms]] is ''Gules, on a bend or, a bear passant sable, langued, armed and vilené of the field.'' The official blazon specifies that the tongue, claws and penis are red—and by extension it is important to always depict the bear as male.<ref>[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ch-be.html Flags of the World.com]. Retrieved 8 January 2012</ref>

==Religion==
[[File:bernriver.jpg|thumb|Capital city of [[Bern]] with the [[Aare]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Nydeggkirche]] on left]]
Most Bernese are Protestant ({{as of|2000|lc=on}}, 67%),<ref name="BFS Religion">{{cite web |last=Federal Department of Statistics |title=Wohnbevölkerung nach Religion |year=2004 |url=http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/01/05/blank/key/religionen.html |format=Interactive Map | access-date = 15 January 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160924182116/http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/01/05/blank/key/religionen.html | archive-date = 24 September 2016 | url-status = dead}}</ref> and most Protestants belong to the [[Swiss Reformed Church]], which is officially recognised as a [[state church]] ({{langx|de|link=no|Landeskirche}}), although it is autonomous in its governance and is organised along democratic principles. The canton is also home to a great number of small [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Christian denominations unaffiliated with the state church. Bernese evangelical groups are mostly found in the [[Emmental]] and [[Berner Oberland]], where they have a long tradition; several contemporary North American religious groups, such as the [[Amish]] and [[Mennonites]], were founded or co-founded by Bernese emigrants to the United States. Two small Evangelical political parties are represented in the [[Grand Council of Bern|Bernese cantonal parliament]].

Bern features substantial Roman Catholic (16%)<ref name="BFS Religion" /> and [[Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland|Christian Catholic]] minorities. These churches also have state church status, and the small Jewish community is similarly recognised by law. As everywhere in Switzerland, there are also significant religious communities of immigrants, including [[Sikh]]s (who have a prominent [[Gurdwara]], or temple, in [[Langenthal, Switzerland|Langenthal]]), [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (who have built the [[Bern Switzerland Temple]]) and [[Islam|Muslims]]. {{As of|2006}}, the plans to expand a backyard mosque in Langenthal with a symbolic [[minaret]] have, as elsewhere in Switzerland, caused a public stir due to vocal opposition from local conservative and evangelical leaders.<ref>{{cite news |title=Minaret row rumbles on in Switzerland |url=http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/search/detail/Minaret_row_rumbles_on_in_Switzerland.html?siteSect=881&sid=7038135 |publisher=[[Swissinfo]] |date=5 September 2006 | access-date= 2006-02-10}}</ref>

From the {{as of|2000|alt=2000 census}}, 607,358 or 63.5% belonged to the [[Swiss Reformed Church]], while 153,357 or 16.0% were Roman Catholic. Of the rest of the population, there were 9,153 [[Orthodoxy#Christianity|members of an Orthodox church]] (or about 0.96% of the population), there were 1,064 individuals (or about 0.11% of the population) who belonged to the [[Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland|Christian Catholic Church]], and there were 71,233 individuals (or about 7.44% of the population) who belonged to another Christian church. There were 807 individuals (or about 0.08% of the population) who were Jewish, and 28,377 (or about 2.96% of the population) who were Muslims. There were 2,662 individuals who were [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], 5,991 individuals who were [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and 913 individuals who belonged to another church. 74,162 (or about 7.75% of the population) belonged to no church, are agnostic or [[Atheism|atheist]], and 37,059 individuals (or about 3.87% of the population) did not answer the question.<ref name="STAT2000" />

==Economy==
[[File:Emmentaler.jpg|thumb|[[Emmentaler]] cheese]]
Tourism is the main source of income in the Bernese Oberland. Other important sectors are agriculture (especially cattle breeding), cheese making, and hydroelectric power generation. The Bernese cheese [[Emmentaler]] is known around the world. In the Bernese Midlands the lands are more fertile. Agriculture is of great importance, but this part of the canton is also the most industrialized. Small and middle-sized businesses are important employers in this part of the canton of Bern. There is a nuclear power plant at [[Mühleberg]]; however, it is no longer operational.

The area around Lake Biel is renowned for its wine production. The 3 French-speaking districts of the Bernese Jura and the bilingual district of [[Biel/Bienne]] are renowned for their watch industry and its mechanical industry (high precision machine tools, automation and machining).

{{as of|2015}}, Bern had an unemployment rate of 2.58%, compared to the Swiss national average of 3.3%. {{as of|2013}}, there were 34,200 people employed in the [[Primary sector of the economy|primary economic sector]] and about 11,563 businesses involved in this sector. About 132,800 people were employed in the [[Secondary sector of the economy|secondary sector]] and there were 11,925 businesses in this sector. Approximately 453,800 people were employed in the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sector]], with 55,347 businesses in this sector.<ref name="SFSO" /> Of the working population, 31.0% used public transportation to get to work, and 51.0% used a private car.<ref name="SFSO" />

==Education==
In Bern about 385,640 or (40.3%) of the population have completed non-mandatory [[Education in Switzerland#Secondary|upper secondary education]], and 121,749 or (12.7%) have completed additional higher education (either [[List of universities in Switzerland|university]] or a ''[[Fachhochschule]]''). Of the 121,749 who completed tertiary schooling, 65.0% were Swiss men, 24.8% were Swiss women, 6.2% were non-Swiss men and 4.0% were non-Swiss women.<ref name="STAT2000" />
