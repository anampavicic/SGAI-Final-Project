'''As-Suwayda''' or '''Al-Suwayda Governorate''' ({{langx|ar|مُحافظة السويداء}} / [[ALA-LC]]: ''Muḥāfaẓat as-Suwaydā’'') is one of the fourteen [[Governorates of Syria|governorates]] (provinces) of [[Syria]]. It is the southernmost governorate, covering an area of 5,550&nbsp;km², and is part of the historic [[Hawran]] region. The capital and largest city of the governorate is [[al-Suwayda]]. 

Geographically the governorate comprises almost all of [[Jabal al-Druze]], the eastern part of [[Argob|Lejah]], and a part of the arid eastern steppe of [[Harrat al-Shamah]].

Most inhabitants of As-Suwayda are employed in agriculture, cultivating crops such as grapes, apples, olives, and wheat.  Additionally, As-Suwayda is home to numerous archaeological sites. 

This governorate is unique in Syria as it has a [[Druze]] majority. Additionally, it has integrated [[Christian]] communities that have long [[Christianity and Druze|coexisted harmoniously]] with the Druze in these mountain.<ref name="Balanche 2017 27">{{cite book|title=Atlas of the Near East: State Formation and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 1918–2010|last=Balanche |first=Fabrice|year=2017|isbn=9789004345188|page=27|publisher=Brill|quote=...comprised 50,328 inhabitants, of whom 85 per cent were Druze, and it integrated Christian communities (7,000 people) who had long lived in these mountains in harmony with the Druze.}}</ref>
