'''San Pedro Sula''' ({{IPA|es|sam ˈpeðɾo ˈsula}}) is the capital of [[Cortés Department]], [[Honduras]]. It is located in the northwest corner of the country in the [[Sula Valley]], about 50 kilometers (31 miles) south of [[Puerto Cortés]] on the [[Caribbean Sea]]. With a population of 701,200 in the central urban area (2023 calculation)<ref>[https://www.citypopulation.de/en/honduras/cities/ Citypopulation.de] Population of the major cities in Honduras</ref> and a population of 1,445,598 in its [[metropolitan area]] in 2023, it is the nation's primary industrial center and second largest city after the capital [[Tegucigalpa]], and the largest city in [[Central America]] that is not a capital city.

==History==
Before the arrival of the Spanish, the [[Sula Valley]] was home to approximately 50,000 native inhabitants.<ref>Euraque, Darío. El capitalismo de San Pedro Sula y la historia política hondureña (1870–1972). Editorial Guaymuras, 2001.</ref> The area that is home to the modern city served as a local trade hub for the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] and [[Aztec]] civilizations. The [[Spanish conquest of Honduras|Spanish conquest]] brought about a demographic collapse from which the native population would never recover.

On 27 June 1536, Don [[Pedro de Alvarado]] founded a Spanish town beside the Indian settlement of Choloma, with the name of Villa de Señor San Pedro de Puerto Caballos (modern San Pedro Sula). The new town had 35 Spanish citizens, and Alvarado allocated 200 of his slaves to help build the new town and work the surrounding fields. He sent out expeditions into outlying regions to secure the new town, extend the area of Spanish domination, and commandeer supplies. Alvarado annulled all encomienda rights established in the area under Andres de Cerezeda, and reassigned the villages to the citizens of San Pedro.

The new settlement barely survived the colonial period. In 1601, the Spanish government declared [[Santo Tomás de Castilla|Santo Tomás]] as the official port for the Central American colonies; this move diverted exports from [[Puerto Cortés]] and resulted in an economic decline that would last through the 17th century. Additionally, San Pedro Sula was left exposed to raids by pirates and French, Dutch, and English mercenaries. By the mid-18th century, the Spanish government decided to build a number of coastal fortresses to curb English attacks. One of these fortresses, the [[Fortaleza de San Fernando]], was built in [[Omoa]], less than 50 miles from San Pedro Sula. The subsequent increase in trade supported an increase in population from 70 inhabitants in 1714 to 357 in 1789.<ref>The Cost of Conquest: Indian Decline in Honduras Under Spanish Rule. By Newson, Linda. Boulder: Westview Press, 1986. Pp.  375. Paper.</ref>

Post-[[Act of Independence of Central America|independence]] San Pedro Sula remained an impoverished village, dependent on trade between Omoa and the country's interior. In 1875, Frank Frye, the American consul in the [[Bay Islands Department|Bay Islands]], reported a population of 1200. The city benefitted from the growth of the banana trade in the 1870s and 1880s and formed a close relationship with US-based shipper and railroad entrepreneur [[Samuel Zemurray]]'s [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]], and the construction of the Interoceanic Railroad between 1869 and 1874 which connected the city to the coast at [[Puerto Cortés]]. Zemurray worked closely with local elites who invested in subsidiary enterprises and thus shaped the way politically for Cuyamel to establish itself and pay very few taxes.<ref>Dario Euraque, ''Reinterperting the Banana Republic: Region and State in Honduras, 1870–1972'' (Chapel Hill, North Carolina: University of North Carolina Press, 1996) pp. 25–27.</ref>

==Economy==
In 2013, fifteen years after the [[effects of Hurricane Mitch in Honduras|effects of Hurricane Mitch]], Honduras is one of the poorest countries in Latin America; around San Pedro Sula, [[Banana production in Honduras|banana production]] has not fully recovered, and "manufacturing has all but dried up."<ref name="latimes2013">{{cite web|title= In Honduras, rival gangs keep a death grip on San Pedro Sula|url= http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-c1-honduras-violence-20131216-dto,0,5251038.htmlstory |first= Tracy |last= Wilkinson|work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |date= 17 December 2013 |access-date= 17 December 2013}}</ref> The problems are exacerbated by organized gangs, whose rules prevent residents from safely leaving gang-controlled neighborhoods such as [[Chamelecón]] for jobs in other parts of town.<ref name="latimes2013"/>

According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', "the homicide rate is stoked by the rivalry of the brutal street gangs, mostly descendants of gangs formed in Los Angeles and deported to Central America in the 1990s, including [[Mara Salvatrucha]] (MS-13) and the [[18th Street gang]]. Their ranks are fed by the disastrous economy of Honduras, and emboldened more recently by alliances with [[Mexican Drug War|Mexican drug traffickers]] moving cocaine through the country."<ref name= "latimes2013"/>

Crime and economic stress have led to the migration of large numbers of unaccompanied minors to the US border. The latest data from the CBP shows San Pedro Sula as the major source for Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) migrating from Honduras.

San Pedro Sula, as most cities built under the Spanish colonial period,{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} is divided in quadrants.
Avenues in the city run from north to south and streets run from east to west. First Street and First Avenue mark the "center of the city" and effectively divide it into four major quadrants NW, NE, SW and SE.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fiallos|first=Maria|title=Honduras and the Bay Islands Adventure Guide|date=2 January 2009|publisher=Hunter Publishing, Inc.|location=Edison, NJ|isbn=9781588436023|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JhivGOEv9D8C&q=San+Pedro+Sula+quadrants&pg=PT203|access-date=1 July 2012}}</ref>

Archibold |date=2 August 2014 |work=[[New York Times]]}}</ref> This is not the Colonia El Chamelecón neighborhood within San Pedro Sula, but rather it is the [[Chamelecón]] that lies outside to the south of San Pedro Sula, on the [[Chamelecón River]].
