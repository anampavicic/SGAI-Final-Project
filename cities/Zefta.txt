'''Zefta''' ({{langx|ar|زفتى}}&nbsp; {{IPA|arz|ˈzeftæ|pron}}, [[Coptic language|Coptic]]: ⲍⲉⲃⲉⲑⲉ ''Zevethe''<ref>''Emile Amélineau.'' La géographie de l’Egypte à l'époque copte. — Paris: Imprimerie nationale, 1893. — 690 p</ref>) is an Egyptian city in the [[Nile delta]], within the [[Gharbia governorate]]. It is across the Nile from [[Mit Ghamr]] city of [[Ad Daqahliyah]] governorate.

==History==
In the 12th century, Zefta was an important regional trading center, especially for [[textile]]s; [[silk]], [[flax]], [[indigo]], [[sesame]], and [[sugar]] were among the commodities bought and sold here. Some of these products were consumed locally, while others were sent to other towns, including [[Cairo]].<ref name="Waqf Inventory">{{cite journal |last1=Hathaway |first1=Jane |title=The Wealth and Influence of an Exiled Ottoman Eunuch in Egypt: The Waqf Inventory of ʿAbbās Agha |journal=Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient |date=1994 |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=302–303, 307–308 |doi=10.2307/3632654 |jstor=3632654 }}</ref>

In the 1670s, [[Abbas Agha]], the Chief Eunuch of the [[Ottoman Empire]], made a large ''[[waqf]]'' endowment consisting of diverse Egyptian properties. Zefta was home to the single largest number of properties he endowed, leading [[Jane Hathaway (academic)|Jane Hathaway]] to describe it as his "pet charity".<ref name="Waqf Inventory"/> Among Abbas Agha's endowments in Zefta was a large complex where [[coffee bean]]s were pounded and roasted, along with an associated [[coffeehouse]].<ref name="Arab Lands">{{cite book |last1=Hathaway |first1=Jane |title=The Arab Lands under Ottoman Rule: 1516-1800 |date=2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317875635 |page=177 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mF0SBAAAQBAJ |access-date=30 May 2020}}</ref><ref name="Waqf Inventory"/> Hathaway hypothesizes that, given its earlier importance as a trade center, 17th-century Zefta remained an important [[entrepot]] where boats carrying coffee from [[Suez]] to Cairo would stop. From Zefta, the coffee would then have been taken into other towns for consumption.<ref name="Waqf Inventory"/> Other properties Abbas Agha endowed in Zifta included a [[qaysariyya]], [[caravanserai]], fifteen shops and two workshops, and a [[madrasa|school]] teaching the [[Qur'an]] - the only school included in the endowment. He also left four copper vessels to the [[physician]]s of Zefta, a rare exception to the rule that waqf endowments must consist of immovable property.<ref name="Waqf Inventory"/>

The [[1885 Census of Egypt]] recorded Zifta as a city in its own district in [[Gharbia Governorate]]; at that time, the population of the city was 11,087 (5,571 men and 5,516 women).<ref name="1885 Census">{{cite book |last1=Egypt min. of finance, census dept |title=Recensement général de l'Égypte |date=1885 |page=320 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OpQNAAAAQAAJ |access-date=21 June 2020}}</ref>

Zefta is well known in the modern Egyptian history during the 1919 uprising, also known as the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919]], when the British occupation expelled [[Saad Zaghloul]] Pasha out of Egypt along with other leaders of the [[Wafd Party]] and were exiled to Malta, the people of Zefta, led by [[Mohamed El Kafrawy Pasha]] and [[Youssef El Guindi]], gathered and declared their independence from the crown and named it [[Zefta Republic]]. The town of Zefta has also seen the birth of [[Mostafa Younis]], who works in the field of aviation, [[Fouad Younis]], who works as an  accountant and the engineer [[Moghad Younis]].{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

Zefta, is the location of one of Nile barrages built during 1881–1952 to control the Nile flow.

Notable figures born in or around Zefta include:<br />
[[Kimon Evan Marengo]], [[Mostafa Kamal Tolba]], [[Mostafa El-Sayed]], [[Mark Ibn Kunbar]], [[Ahmed Seif al-Islam Keshty]], [[Eman Hassaballa Aly]], [[Sameera Moussa]] and Samir Al Aswad.
