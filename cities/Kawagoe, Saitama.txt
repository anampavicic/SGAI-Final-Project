==History==
Kawagoe is part of ancient [[Musashi Province]] and the area was heavily contested between the [[Later Hōjō clan]] and the two branches of the [[Uesugi clan]], as they vied for control of the [[Kantō region]]. In the 1450s, Kawagoe was held by the Yamanouchi branch of the Uesugi Clan. Decades later, [[Hōjō Ujitsuna]] seized [[Kawagoe Castle]] in 1537, and the city served as an important base of operations when the Later Hōjō clan sought to gain control of the Kantō. For roughly two decades after that, the Uesugi launched a number of attempts to regain the region. This culminated in the 1545 [[Battle of Kawagoe]], as the heavily outnumbered Hōjō garrison of Kawagoe defeated an attempted siege of Kawagoe Castle. This victory would lead to the end of Uesugi power in the region, and the near-total destruction of the clan. The Hōjō having secured themselves in the region, Kawagoe served for another forty-five years as a satellite castle town defending Edo, and the clan's central [[Odawara Castle|castle]] at [[Odawara]]. Kawagoe's location on the [[Arakawa River (Kantō)|Arakawa River]] and near the [[Edo River]] were important elements of its tactical significance in defending the Kantō region from potential attacks from the north.

During the [[Edo period]], Kawagoe Castle was the headquarters of the [[Kawagoe Domain]] under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], which had the largest ''[[kokudaka]]'' of any holding in the Kantō region outside of the control of the Tokugawa clan. The city prospered as a commercial and transshipment center and was nicknamed the "kitchen of Edo". After the [[Meiji restoration]], it briefly became capital of Kawagoe Prefecture (1871) then Iruma Prefecture (1871–1873), before becoming part of Saitama Prefecture.

The town of Kawagoe was created within [[Iruma District, Saitama]] with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. A large part of the town was destroyed in a fire on May 13, 1893 and was rebuilt with many structures using construction techniques of traditional [[Kura (storehouse)|''kura'']] warehouses. On December 1, 1922 Kawagoe merged with neighboring Senba Village, and was elevated to city status, with a population of 30,359. It was the first municipality in Saitama Prefecture to receive city status. {{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The village of Tanomozawa was annexed in 1939. The city escaped [[World War II]] with only minor damage. The city expanded in 1955 by annexing the villages of Yoshino, Furuya, Minamifuruya, Takashina, Fukuhara, Daito, Kasumigaseki, Naguwashi and Yamada. In December 1999, the old core of Kawagoe was designated a [[Groups of Traditional Buildings|Historic Preservation District]]. On April 1, 2003, Kawagoe was designated a [[Core cities of Japan|core city]] with increased local autonomy.

==Government==
Kawagoe has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 36 members. Kawagoe contributes four members to the Saitama Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of [[Saitama 7th district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

* {{nihongo|Bell of Time|時の鐘|Toki no kane}} is a bell tower originally built on the orders of {{nihongo|[[Sakai Tadakatsu]]|酒井 忠勝}} between 1624 and 1644. The present structure goes back to 1894, a year after the Great Fire of Kawagoe. It is a three-story tower measuring 16 meters in height. The tower has been telling time to the city's residents for 350 years and has been deemed as a symbol of the city. Currently, the bell can be heard four times a day (6 AM, 12 PM, 3 PM and 6 PM) <ref>[http://www.city.kawagoe.saitama.jp/welcome/kankospot/kurazukurizone/tokinokane.html Kawagoe City website].

Within and beyond the Kurazukuri Street, many warehouses from the 18th and 19th centuries can still be seen. The Kawagoe Kurazukuri Museum is located in a traditional warehouse built in 1893 and allows its visitors to walk around inside and experience the life of Edo merchants.<ref>[http://www.kawagoe.com/kzs/kuradukuri.html Kawagoe Kuradukuri Museum website].
