'''Rotherham''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Rotherham.ogg|ˈ|r|ɒ|ð|ər|ə|m}} {{respell|RODH|ər|əm}})<ref>{{cite book|last=Wells|first=John C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|page=697|isbn=9781405881180}}</ref> is a Minster town in [[South Yorkshire]], England. It lies at the confluence of the [[River Rother, South Yorkshire|River Rother]], from which the town gets its name, and the [[River Don, Yorkshire|River Don]]. It is the largest settlement of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham]].

Rotherham has been a market town since the 13th century, when King John granted market charter status in 1207.

Before the [[Industrial Revolution]], traditional industries included farming, glass making and flour milling. In the late 18th and 19th centuries, Rotherham became known for its coal mining and, later, steel industries. The town's [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] is [[Yorkshire]], and Rotherham was once part of the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. In 1974, this [[administrative county]] was abolished during a reorganisation of local government.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ridings of Yorkshire - Wikishire |url=https://wikishire.co.uk/wiki/Ridings_of_Yorkshire#Administrative_history |access-date=2 February 2023 |website=wikishire.co.uk}}</ref> Subsequently, Rotherham became part of the county of [[South Yorkshire]], where it makes up one of four metropolitan boroughs.

Rotherham had a population of 109,691 in the [[2011 Census for England and Wales|2011 census]]. The borough had a {{United Kingdom statistics year|England}} population of {{English district population|GSS= E08000018}}, the [[List of English districts by population|{{English district rank|GSS= E08000018}}]] most populous district in England.

==History==
===Early history===
Evidence of [[Iron Age]] and [[Roman Britain|Roman]] settlements has been found in Rotherham area. This includes a small Roman fort to the south-west in the upper flood meadow of the Don at [[Templeborough]]. 
[[File:Old Rotherham.jpg|thumb|left|Rotherham in the late Medieval period]]

Rotherham was founded in the early [[Middle Ages]]. Its name is from Old English ''hām'' 'homestead, estate', meaning 'homestead on the Rother'. The river name is of Brittonic origin for 'main river', ''ro-'' 'over, chief' and ''duβr'' 'water'. Another river called the [[River Rother, East Sussex|Rother]] flows through [[East Sussex]].<ref>Watts, Victor (ed.), ''The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names Based on the Collections of the English Place-Name Society'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), s.vv. ROTHERHAM and River ROTHER SYorks.</ref> An [[Anglo-Saxon]] settlement, with an [[ecclesiastical parish]], was established near the Roman [[ford (crossing)|ford]] across the River Don.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rotherhamunofficial.co.uk/history/middleages.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819062305/http://www.rotherhamunofficial.co.uk/history/middleages.htm|url-status=dead|title=RotherhamUnOfficial|archivedate=19 August 2007|accessdate=25 November 2023}}</ref>

The 1086 [[Domesday Book]] records a manor previously held by [[feudal system|lord]] Hakon in 1066 tenanted by [[William the Conqueror]]'s half-brother, [[Robert de Mortain]]. The 1086 record shows an absentee lord who held the most inhabited [[Manorialism|manor]], [[Nigel Fossard]]. The [[city proper|town area]] today includes eight outlying Domesday estates. Eight adult male householders were counted as villagers, three were smallholders and one the priest, three [[Carucate|ploughlands]] were tilled by one lord's plough team and two and a half men's plough teams were active. The manor also had a church, roughly four acres of meadow and seven woodland acres. Rotherham had a mill valued at half a pound sterling.<ref name="Hey" /><ref>[http://domesdaymap.co.uk/place/SK4392/rotherham/ Domesday Map] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026135604/http://domesdaymap.co.uk/place/SK4392/rotherham/ |date=26 October 2014 }} Retrieved 6 February 2015.</ref>

Fossard's successors, the De Vesci family, rarely visited the town, but maintained a Friday market and a fair. In the mid 13th century, John de Vesci and Ralph de Tili gave all their possessions in Rotherham to [[Rufford Abbey]]. The monks from the abbey collected [[tithe]]s from the town and gained rights to an extra market day on Monday and to extend the annual fair from two to three days.<ref name="Hey">David Hey, ''Medieval South Yorkshire''</ref>

The townsmen of Rotherham formed the "Greaves of Our Lady's Light," an organisation which worked with the town's three [[guild]]s. It was suppressed in 1547 but revived in 1584 as the [[feoffees]] of the [[common land]]s of Rotherham, and remains in existence.<ref name="Hey" />

In the 1480s the Rotherham-born [[Archbishop of York]], [[Thomas Rotherham]], instigated the building of a College of Jesus in Rotherham to rival the colleges of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. It was the first brick building in what is now South Yorkshire and taught theology, religious chant and hymns, grammar and writing.<ref name="Hey" />

The college and new parish of [[All Saints Church, Rotherham|All Saints Church]] made Rotherham an enviable and modern town at the turn of the 16th century. The college was dissolved in 1547 during the reign of [[Edward VI]], and its assets were stripped by the crown. Very little remains of the original building in College Street. Walls of part of the College of Jesus are encased within number 23 and Nos 2, 2A, 4 (later for a time ''Old College Inn'', a beerhouse), 6 and 8 Effingham Street. A doorway was rescued from demolition and relocated to nearby Boston Park in 1879.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1001500|desc=BOSTON PARK, Rotherham |access-date=1 July 2019}}</ref> Sixty years after the college's dissolution Rotherham was described by a wealthy visitor as falling from a fashionable college town to a place of gambling and vice. The history of Thomas Rotherham and education in the town are remembered in the name of [[Thomas Rotherham College]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.thomroth.ac.uk/web/website/index.php|title = Thomas Rotherham College|publisher = Thomas Rotherham College|access-date = 9 October 2008}}</ref>

[[Mary, Queen of Scots]] stayed in Rotherham for two nights at the end of January 1569. It has been suggested that she stayed in the College building. Two men, a Mr Lete and Mr Bayley, were paid for guarding her.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Leader |first1=John Daniel |title=Mary Queen of Scots in Captivity |date=1880 |location=Sheffield |page=30}}</ref>

===Industrial Revolution===
The Rotherham area had been used for iron production since the Roman occupation of Britain. Toward the end of the 18th century, coal seams near the town made Rotherham an important settlement in the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Coal was exported from the town by river, and this led to infrastructure improvements in the River Don's navigability.  The River Don eventually became an artery of the [[Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation]] system of navigable inland waterways.

During the early Industrial Revolution iron, and later steel, became the principal industries in Rotherham, surviving into the 20th century. The Walker family built an iron empire in the 18th century, their foundries producing high quality cannons, including the majority of guns for the ship [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cliftonpark.org.uk/homepage/29/the-walkers-of-clifton-house|title=The Walkers of Clifton House|access-date=22 October 2023}}</ref> and cast iron bridges, one of which was commissioned by [[Thomas Paine]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Pennsylvania History |volume=18 |issue=1 |date=January 1951 |first=W. H. G. |last=Armytage |title=Thomas Paine and the Walkers: An Early Episode in Anglo-American Cooperation |pages=16–30 |url=https://journals.psu.edu/phj/article/view/22070/21839 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612142503/https://journals.psu.edu/phj/article/view/22070/21839 |archive-date=12 June 2015}}</ref>

Rotherham's cast iron industry expanded rapidly in the early 19th century, with the Effingham Ironworks, later Yates, Haywood & Co, opening in 1820. Other major [[iron founder]]s included William Corbitt and Co; George Wright and Co of Burton Weir; Owen and Co of Wheathill Foundry; Morgan Macauley and Waide of the Baths Foundry; the Masbro' Stove Grate Co belonging to Messrs. Perrot, W. H. Micklethwait and John and Richard Corker of the Ferham Works. G & WG Gummer Ltd exported brass products across the world, supplying fittings for hotels, hospitals, Turkish baths and the RMS Mauretania. Their fittings could also be found on battleships used in the Second World War and HMS ''Ark Royal''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rothbiz.co.uk/2011/10/news-2316-gummers-name-140-years-on.html|title=News: The Gummers name 140 years on|access-date=1 July 2019}}</ref>

The Parkgate Ironworks was established in 1823 by Sanderson and Watson, and changed ownership several times. In 1854, Samuel Beal & Co produced wrought iron plates for [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s famous steamship the [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Cableships/GreatEastern/index.htm|title = History of the Atlantic Cable & Submarine Telegraphy – Great Eastern|publisher = atlantic-cable.com|access-date = 9 October 2008|last = Glover|first = Bill}}</ref> In 1864, the ironworks was taken over by the Parkgate Iron Co. Ltd, becoming the [[Park Gate Iron and Steel Company]] in 1888. The company was purchased by Tube Investments Ltd in 1956 and closed in 1974. [[Steel, Peech and Tozer]]'s massive Templeborough steelworks (now the [[Magna Science Adventure Centre]]) was, at its peak, over a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) long, employing 10,000 workers, and housing six [[electric arc furnace]]s producing 1.8&nbsp;million tonnes of steel a year. The operation closed down in 1993.

The first railway stations, [[Holmes railway station|Holmes]] and [[Rotherham Westgate railway station|Rotherham Westgate]] both on the [[Sheffield and Rotherham Railway]] opened on 31 October 1838. Holmes station was located close to the works of [[Isaac Dodds and Son]], pioneers in the development of railway technology. Later railway stations included [[Parkgate and Aldwarke railway station]] on the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]], which opened in July 1873, the [[Parkgate and Rawmarsh railway station]] on the [[North Midland Railway]] and the [[Rotherham Masborough railway station]] also on the North Midland Railway.

Rotherham Forge and Rolling Mill occupied an island in the river known as Forge Island. Its managing director was Francis Charles Moss of Wickersley, until his death in 1942. The site was later occupied by a Tesco superstore, and by 2024 was the location of a new leisure development with an 8-screen cinema, food and drink outlets and a hotel. Completion was initially scheduled for October 2021,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rothbiz.co.uk/2018/08/news-5871-developer-heading-for-forge.html|title=News: Developer heading for Forge Island|access-date=1 July 2019}}</ref> but the project was delayed, with most facilities are opening during 2024.<ref>Aroundtown Magazine, May/June 2024, p. 22</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rotherham.gov.uk/news/article/1052/families-welcomed-to-discover-forge-island-with-a-celebration-day-of-activities|title=FAMILIES WELCOMED TO DISCOVER FORGE ISLAND WITH A CELEBRATION DAY OF ACTIVITIES|first=Jayne|last=Oates|website=Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council}}</ref>

Joseph Foljambe established a factory to produce his Rotherham plough, the first commercially successful iron [[plough]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.rotherhamweb.co.uk/h/plough.htm|title = The Invention of the Rotherham Plough by Stanyforth and Foljambe|publisher = rotherhamweb.co.uk|access-date = 9 October 2008|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924092217/http://www.rotherhamweb.co.uk/h/plough.htm|archive-date = 24 September 2015}}</ref>

A [[Glassblowing|glass works]] was set up in Rotherham in 1751, and became Beatson Clark & Co, one of the town's largest manufacturers, exporting glass medicine bottles worldwide. Beatson Clark & Co was a family business until 1961, when it became a [[public company]]. The glass works operated on the same site, although the family connection ceased and the company is owned by Newship Ltd, a holding company linked to the industrialist John Watson Newman. It continues to the manufacture [[Glass container industry|glass containers]] for the [[pharmaceutical]], food and drinks industries.<ref name=beatson>{{cite web|url=http://www.beatsonclark.co.uk |title=Beatson Clark today |publisher=Beatsonclark.co.uk |date=30 August 2012 }}</ref> In the 19th century, other successful industries included [[pottery]], [[brass]] making and the manufacture of cast iron fireplaces. Precision manufacturing companies in the town include AESSEAL, Nikken Kosakusho Europe, MTL Advanced, MGB Plastics and [[Macalloy]]. Rotherham is the location of the [[Advanced Manufacturing Park]] (AMP), which is home to a number of world-class companies including Rolls-Royce and McLaren Automotive.

{{blockquote|The district abounds in mineral wealth; coal and iron ore are found in great profusion, and have been wrought from [long ago]. The town was formerly celebrated for its manufacture of edge tools; and in 1160, there were mines of [[ironstone]], smelting-furnaces, and forges in the neighbourhood. But the most extraordinary establishments of this kind, of late years, were the iron-foundries belonging to Messrs. Walker, in which immense quantities of cannon of the largest calibre were wrought for government during the war, till the works were given up by the original proprietors, and let out to small capitalists. The spinning of flax affords employment to about 200 persons; there are manufactories for rope and for starch, a large malting establishment, two large [[real ale|ale]] and [[porter (beer)|porter]] breweries, several oil and chemical works, and a glass-[making] house. Some other manufactories and works are noticed in the article on [[Masbrough]]. The Don, which is navigable to Sheffield, communicates with the river Aire on the north-east, with the Stainforth and Keadby canal on the east, with the Dearne and Dove canal and the Barnsley canal on the north-west, and consequently with the river Calder; by which means Rotherham enjoys [goods trade] with all the principal towns in the great manufacturing districts of Yorkshire and Lancashire. In 1836 an act was passed for making a railway to Sheffield, with a branch to the Greasbrough canal and coal-field; it was opened [in] 1838, and the distance is about six miles....The market is on Monday, for corn, cattle, and provisions: on alternate Mondays is a celebrated market for fat-cattle, sheep, and hogs, numerously attended by grazers from distant parts of the country; and fairs take place on Whit-Monday and December 1st, for cattle. A [[court leet]] is held annually, at which constables and other officers for the internal regulation of the town are appointed|A Topographical Dictionary of England|[[Samuel Lewis (publisher)|Samuel Lewis]], 1848.}}

[[Mill (grinding)|Milling]] grain into flour was a traditional industry in Rotherham, formerly in the [[Millmoor]] area, hence [[Rotherham United F.C.]]'s nickname "The Millers". Flour milling continued at the [[Rank Hovis]] town mill site on Canklow Road<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rankhovis.co.uk/location-map.html |title=About Us / The Mills & Depots |access-date=6 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822113719/http://www.rankhovis.co.uk/location-map.html |archive-date=22 August 2009 }}</ref> until September 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bakeryinfo.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/3762/Rank_Hovis_consults_on_mill_closure.html |title=Rank Hovis consults on mill closure – British Baker |publisher=Bakeryinfo.co.uk |date=11 July 2008 }}</ref> The site of the mill is now a warehousing and distribution facility for local logistics company 4S Distribution.

===Enterprise zone 1983===
In 1983 Rotherham became a designated [[enterprise zone]] with benefits and incentives given to attract new industry and development in the area. Within the first year, ten new companies were established within the zone. The former chemical works at Barbot Hall, which had been derelict, was developed into a new industrial estate and named 'Brookside', after Mangham Brook, which runs alongside it.<ref>'Rotherham now has new hope' p 31 Morning Telegraph Industrial Survey 9 January 1985</ref>

===Floods of 2007===
[[File:Ulleyres.jpg|thumb|[[Ulley reservoir]] between Ulley and Aughton is in the south of the district]]
Rotherham was affected by [[2007 United Kingdom floods|flooding in the summer of 2007]]. This caused the closure of central roads, schools and transport services and damaged residential and commercial property, including the Parkgate Shopping complex and the [[Meadowhall Centre]], which suffered considerable internal water damage. [[Ulley Reservoir]] became a focus of major concern when its dam showed signs of structural damage, threatening to break and release water into the suburbs of [[Treeton]], [[Brinsworth]] and [[Canklow]] as threatening the Junction 33 electrical sub-station. Thousands of homes were evacuated in response.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23401807-details/Hundreds+flee+homes+as+dam+threatens+to+burst+its+banks/article.do |title= Thousands evacuated as dam threatens to burst its banks |access-date=26 June 2007 |work=This is London}}</ref> [[Rother FM]] evacuated its studios, passing its frequency temporarily to neighbouring station [[Trax FM]]. A stretch of the [[M1 motorway]] was closed for three days due to the flood risk. Fire service and police officers used multiple high-powered pumps to lower the water level in the reservoir and reduce pressure on the dam wall, which was damaged but held. By summer 2008, the reservoir and surrounding country park reopened.

A new wetland and flood storage area, Centenary Riverside park, has since been built by Rotherham Council and the Environment Agency to prevent flooding in the future. The [[Wildlife Trust for Sheffield and Rotherham]] manages the site as a local nature reserve. The site is home to the massive sculpture Steel Henge, a [[Stonehenge replicas and derivatives|Stonehenge replica]] which is in fact made from iron ingots.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/sheffield/hi/people_and_places/nature/newsid_8835000/8835559.stm|title=Steel Henge and Centenary Riverside|date=19 July 2010|access-date=2 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/7967818.stm|title=Wildlife park to prevent flooding|date=27 March 2009|access-date=2 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-23560429|title=Wildlife sites win cash backing|date=3 August 2013|work=BBC News|access-date=2 December 2017}}</ref>

She issued a report on the [[Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal|child sexual exploitation scandal]] that extended beyond the cases investigated by the police.

Both reports stated that a majority of the known perpetrators were of [[British Pakistanis|Pakistani]] heritage.

[[File:Rotherham Minster - geograph.org.uk - 2811583.jpg|thumb|[[Rotherham Minster]], the town's oldest and most prominent landmark]]
[[Rotherham Minster|All Saints Minster]], on a square of the same name, was built using [[ashlar|neat-cut]] pieces made of a unique sandstone, Rotherham Red, with a low-pitched lead roofing. It is a Grade I [[listed building]].<ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1132733|desc=Rotherham Minster or All Saints' Church|grade=I|access-date=6 February 2015}}</ref> A Belfry was added to the church in 1501 and today the Minster houses 13 bells. A church has stood on the site since before the Norman Conquest and the current building dates from the 15th century and includes parts from earlier Saxon and Norman structures. Clayton and Bell working to [[George Gilbert Scott]]'s designs constructed the east window. Stained glass makers and designers A. Gibbs, Camm Brothers, Heaton, Butler and Bayne and James Bell are known makers of the other windows. Gargoyles flank its clock on each face. It has a "recessed octagonal spire with crocketed arrises and pinnacled shafts rising from corner faces and a gilded weathervane." Architectural critics [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] and [[Simon Jenkins]] considered it "the best perpendicular [style] church in the country" and "the best work in the county", respectively.

Close to the town centre is the 15th-century [[Rotherham Bridge|Chapel of Our Lady of Rotherham Bridge]] (or "Chapel on the Bridge"), beside [[River Don Navigation#Bridge Street Bridge and Chantry Bridge|Chantry Bridge]] (a road bridge opened in the 1930s). It is one of four surviving bridge chapels in the country. The chapel was restored in 1923, having been used as the town jail and a [[tobacconist]]'s shop.

The town was once home to Jesus College, founded by Thomas Rotherham in the fifteenth century. The remains of the college's buildings are in the town centre, where some of the earliest examples of a brick-built structure remain although not accessible to the public. The gate to the College of Jesus can be found in nearby Boston Park. [[File:Boston Castle, Rotherham - geograph.org.uk - 4123571.jpg|thumb|left|Boston Castle]]
Boston Castle, in the grounds of Boston Park, was built as a hunting lodge by [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Earl of Effingham]] between 1773 and 1774 to mark his opposition to British attempts to crush the Americans in their [[American Revolutionary War|war for independence]]. It is named after [[Boston, Massachusetts]], the scene of the [[Boston Tea Party]].<ref>John Goodchild, 'Matters of Concern: the Life Story of the Third Earl of Effingham', Aspects of Rotherham: Discovering Local History, ed. Melvyn Jones (Barnsley: Wharncliffe Publishing Limited, 1995).</ref>

Built in the 18th century, Clifton House houses [[Clifton Park Museum]].

On the outskirts of Rotherham, a brick-built glass making furnace, the [[Catcliffe Glass Cone]], is the oldest surviving structure of its type in [[Western Europe]] and one of four remaining in the United Kingdom – the others being the [[Red House Cone]] in the Wordsley centre of the Dudley Glassworks in the West Midlands, [[Lemington Glass Works]] west of Newcastle upon Tyne and [[Alloa]] in Scotland. Threatened with demolition in the 1960s, it has been preserved as a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]] and stands as a focal point in a sheltered housing complex and close to the path leading up the Rother valley.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1132732|desc=Catcliffe Glass Cone|grade=I|access-date=6 February 2015}} Scheduling: {{NHLE|num=1004819|access-date=6 February 2015}}</ref>

The ruins of [[Roche Abbey]], south of [[Maltby, South Yorkshire|Maltby]] and half-way to [[Worksop]], have multi-storey walls, which is unusual.

{{See also|List of schools in Rotherham}}
Rotherham has three [[Further Education]] institutions and colleges. These are [[Thomas Rotherham College]], [[Dearne Valley College]] and the [[Rotherham College of Arts and Technology]]. The Rotherham College of Arts and Technology has a campus in the Rotherham town centre and a second site in [[Dinnington, South Yorkshire|Dinnington]], as well as a nearby, smaller campus for construction-based subjects, such as bricklaying.

==Governance==
[[File:Rotherham Town Hall.jpg|thumbnail|[[Rotherham Town Hall]] (originally the West Riding Courthouse; in civic use since 1985).]]
{{See also|Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council|Rotherham (UK Parliament constituency)}}
There is one main tier of local government covering Rotherham, at [[metropolitan borough]] level: [[Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council]]. The borough council is also a member of the [[South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority]], led by the directly elected [[Mayor of South Yorkshire]]. Some outer parts of Rotherham are included in [[civil parish]]es, which form an additional tier of local government in these areas, but the central part of the built-up area is an [[unparished area]].

===Administrative history===
Rotherham was an [[ancient parish]]. The parish was divided into eight [[Township (England)|townships]]:  [[Brinsworth]], [[Catcliffe]], [[Dalton, South Yorkshire|Dalton]], [[Greasbrough]], [[Kimberworth]], [[Orgreave, South Yorkshire|Orgreave]], [[Tinsley, South Yorkshire|Tinsley]], and a Rotherham township covering the central part of the parish including the town. These townships were made [[civil parish]]es in 1866.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rotherham Ancient Parish / Civil Parish |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10466118 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=10 March 2024}}</ref>

Until 1801 the parish was governed by its [[vestry]] and [[manorial courts]], in the same way as most rural areas. More urban forms of local government began in 1801 when a body of [[improvement commissioners]] was established for Rotherham township, with responsibilities for paving, lighting, and repairing the streets.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rotherham Market and Improvement Act 1801 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Geo3/41/66/contents/enacted |website=legislation.gov.uk |publisher=The National Archives |access-date=10 March 2024}}</ref> The commissioners were superseded in 1852 by an elected [[Local board of health|local board]], whose district covered both the Rotherham and Kimberworth townships and had more extensive responsibilities, particularly relating to water supply and sewers.<ref>{{cite book |title=Drake's Directory of Rotherham |date=1862 |publisher=E. S. Drake & Co. |location=Sheffield |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAAOdAMiUcIC&pg=PA13 |access-date=10 March 2024}}</ref>

The local board was replaced in 1871 when Rotherham was incorporated as a [[municipal borough]]. In 1902 it was elevated to become a [[county borough]], taking over county-level functions from [[West Riding County Council]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Rotherham Municipal Borough / County Borough |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10136301#tab02 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=10 March 2024}}</ref>

The county borough was abolished in 1974 and replaced by the larger [[Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham]], which also took in the areas of the abolished [[Urban district (England and Wales)|urban districts]] of [[Maltby, South Yorkshire|Maltby]], [[Rawmarsh]], [[Swinton, South Yorkshire|Swinton]], and [[Wath upon Dearne]], plus the [[Kiveton Park Rural District]] and Rotherham [[Rural District]].<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=act|act=Local Government Act 1972|year=1972|chapter=70|access-date=10 March 2024}}</ref>

The Labour Party have controlled the authority since the 1974 incorporation of the Metropolitan Borough. Following the 2016 child sexual exploitation scandal, the way in which local councillors are elected in Rotherham changed, replacing annual rolling elections, with whole council elections every four years.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vote 2014: Rotherham |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/councils/E08000018 |access-date=7 February 2015}}</ref> This change coincided with notable boundary changes, which changed the political landscape of the borough. Rotherham's shadow cabinet local opposition is currently the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] with 18 seats. Independents hold one seat.

In the May 2021 election, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] retained control of the council, while the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] went from zero to 20 seats.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rotherham: Large Tory gains in council all-out election |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-57038429 |work=BBC News |access-date=1 July 2021 |date=8 May 2021}}</ref>

In 2013, Professor [[Alexis Jay]] published a report about the [[Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal]] (1997–2013). Following the report's publication, the council leader, Roger Stone of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], resigned – an act of contrition the report said should have been made years earlier<ref name=peachey>{{cite news| last =Peachey| first =Paul

===Constituencies===
The Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham covers the constituencies of [[Rotherham (UK Parliament constituency)]] which has been held by the Labour Party since 1933; [[Wentworth and Dearne (UK Parliament constituency)]], held by Labour since the creation of the seat in 1983; and [[Rother Valley (UK Parliament constituency)]]. When Rother Valley was won by the Conservatives in the 2019 General Election, this marked the first time the borough of Rotherham had returned anyone other than Labour MPs to Parliament since 1931.

Like most of South Yorkshire, the Rotherham constituencies are considered to be '[[safe seat|safe]]', having enjoyed 'substantial' majorities over a 'long' period of time; a typecast which heightens the [[incumbency|incumbency factor]] present in [[first past the post]] elections. The constituency of Rotherham has been held by Labour MPs since a by-election in 1933. After the resignation and subsequent jailing of [[Denis MacShane]] in November 2012 due to expenses abuse, the [[2012 Rotherham by-election|by-election in 2012]] saw [[Sarah Champion]] elected.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20541136|title=Labour holds Rotherham seat in by-election|date=30 November 2012|work=BBC News|access-date=30 November 2012}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Rotherham Skyline from Coronation Bridge.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Rotherham Skyline from Coronation Bridge]]
Much of the town occupies the slopes of two hills. To the west is the start of a {{convert|3|mi}} north-west crest topped by [[Keppel's Column]], a [[folly]]; to the east is a narrower crest alongside the Rother known as Canklow Hill, topped by a public area, Boston Park. The Rother here is between 32 and 34 metres above sea level.<ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1001500|desc=Boston Park and Garden|access-date=6 February 2015}}</ref> The south scarp is slightly higher with the Canklow Hill Earthworks, a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]].

Rotherham's commercial town centre occupies the valley between these hills on the navigable part of the [[River Don, Yorkshire|River Don]]. The town centre is less than {{convert|0.5|mi|1}} north of the confluence with the [[River Rother, South Yorkshire|Rother]] flowing from the south. The Mid Don Valley continues adjoining towns in the north of the Metropolitan Borough.

Beyond the town centre and away from the Don Valley, the Rotherham district is largely rural, containing a mixture of retired people, larger properties, some farming and tourism and the landscaped [[Wentworth Woodhouse]] estate, where the last surviving [[kiln]] of the [[Rockingham Pottery]] can be seen.

Aside from two regular roads and two bypasses (one being the motorway network), [[Sheffield]] is connected directly by the [[Trans Pennine Trail]] which passes the [[Meadowhall (shopping centre)|Meadowhall]] shopping centre on both sides.

[[Rotherham Central station]] has frequent trains connecting to Sheffield in 14 minutes and [[Doncaster]] in 25 minutes. Most services continue to [[York]], [[Wakefield]] and [[Leeds]].

===Green belt===
{{further|South and West Yorkshire Green Belt}}
Rotherham is within a [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] region that extends into the wider surrounding counties, and is in place to reduce [[urban sprawl]], prevent the towns in the [[Sheffield urban area|Sheffield conurbation]] from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage [[brownfield]] reuse, and preserve nearby countryside.<ref name="belt1">"{{cite web|last1=Council|first1=Rotherham Metropolitan Borough|title=Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council download – Local Plan Core Strategy documentation – Environment and planning – Planning and regeneration|url=http://www.rotherham.gov.uk/downloads/file/1571/adopted_rotherham_core_strategy|website=rotherham.gov.uk}}</ref><ref name="belt2">{{cite web|last1=Council|first1=Rotherham Metropolitan Borough|title=Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council – Strategic Green Belt Review 2012|url=http://www.rotherham.gov.uk/downloads/file/524/strategic_green_belt_review_2012|website=rotherham.gov.uk|access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref>

The green belt was adopted in 1979,<ref name="belt2" /> and the size in the borough in 2017 amounted to some {{convert|20450|ha|km2+sqmi}},<ref>{{cite web|title=Green belt statistics – GOV.UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/green-belt-statistics|website=gov.uk}}</ref> covering 72% of the overall borough.<ref name="belt1" /> The green belt surrounds the Rotherham urban area, with larger outlying towns and villages within the borough such as Treeton, [[Swallownest]] and [[Thurcroft]] exempted. Smaller villages, hamlets and rural areas such as [[Morthen]], [[Ulley]], Guilthwaite, [[Hooton Roberts]] and [[Old Ravenfield]] are within the green belt, minimising unsuitable development in these areas.

A subsidiary aim of the green belt is to encourage recreation and leisure,<ref name="belt1"/> with rural landscape features, greenfield areas and facilities including the Wentworth Woodhouse estate and temple, River Rother, northern portions of the River Don and Hooton Brook, Pinch Mill Brook, golf courses, Ulley reservoir, Herringthorpe allotments, Rotherham Roundwalk and Sheffield Country Walk/Trans-Pennine trails, Thurcroft Hall, and Valley Park.
