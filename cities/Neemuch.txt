'''Neemuch'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://neemuch.nic.in/|title=जिला नीमच, मध्यप्रदेश शासन &#124; भारत}}</ref> or '''Nimach''' is a city in the [[Malwa]] region. Neemuch crowns the north western part of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. It has been also referred to city of Nature and Peace. The town shares its northwestern border with the state of [[Rajasthan]] and is the administrative headquarters of [[Neemuch District]]. Formerly a large [[British people|British]] cantonment of [[Gwalior State|Gwalior princely state]], in 1822 the town became the headquarters of the combined [[Rajputana]]–[[Malwa]] political agency and of the [[Malwa Agency]] in 1895. The British Cantonment was disbanded in 1932 after which it was maintained by a British Municipal Board.

==Etymology==
A number of myths surround the name Neemuch. One is that the city received its name because of the large number of [[Neem]] trees found here. While other story states that city's first dwellers belonged to [[Meena]] caste, leading to the name "Meenuch", which over time became ''Neemuch''. A further theory is that "Nimach" is an abbreviation of "North India Mounted Artillery and Cavalry Headquarters".<ref>{{Cite web |last=rajeshkumar |date=2022-01-20 |title=Districts in Madhya Pradesh- Neemuch |url=https://www.holidaylandmark.com/blog/districts-in-madhya-pradesh-neemuch/ |access-date=2024-04-03 |website=Holiday Landmark Blog |language=en-US}}</ref> This theory is most widely accepted by the locals. There is also a small statue in city's main main market supporting the claim, that reads out "North India Mounted Artillery and Cavalry Headquarters."

==History==

The city was the location of a palace in the district of the [[Ajmer district|Ajmer]]. Originally a part of the territory of Malwa, it was given to the Rana in 1768 to pay off debts incurred by the Rana (king) of [[Mewar]]. After that, it became a British cantonment of the [[Gwalior State|Gwalior princely state]], except for short periods in 1794 and 1844 and 1965.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Neemuch|title=Neemuch &#124; India|date=14 November 2023 |website=Britannica}}</ref> The Cant area of Neemuch was a [[planned town]] constructed by the British as a local military headquarters for the region. The Neemuch cantonment played a significant role in the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] and was the centre of disturbances in Malwa. After the end of rebellion and transfer of power directly to the [[British Monarchy|British crown]] in the [[British Raj|Raj]], Neemuch has always climbed the stairs of progress and success.

In 1857, Neemuch was the most southerly place to which the rebellion extended.<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Neemuch |volume=19 |page=340}}</ref> A brigade of native [[Bengal]] troops were stationed at Neemuch, then mutinied and marched [[Delhi]].<ref name=EB1911/> European officers took refuge in the fort, and were later besieged by a rebel force from [[Mandsaur]].<ref name=EB1911/> The [[Europeans]] defended the city until relieved by the Malwa field force.
