'''Bago''', officially the '''City of Bago''' ({{langx|hil|Dakbanwa/Syudad sang Bago}}; {{langx|fil|Lungsod ng Bago}}), is a 2nd class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Negros Occidental]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 191,210 people.{{PH census|current}}

Located {{convert|22|km|mi}} south of the provincial capital [[Bacolod]], Bago comprises 6.63% of the population of the entire Negros Occidental, making it the third most populous city in the province. It sets a land area of 389 square kilometres, which is 5% of the entire Negros Occidental and 10% of the total land area of component cities.

It is also tagged as the “Home of Historical and Natural Treasures”, owing to its contribution to the history of the province of Negros Occidental and country, and its scenery and flora and fauna making it an eco-tourism destination.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} It is also known as the “Boxing Capital of the Philippines” title, owing to the great names it produced in boxing.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} It is also home to the only three known populations of the endangered [[Irrawaddy dolphin]] in the entire Philippines. The other two populations are in Guimaras and Palawan. All of which are designated as critically endangered populations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/200345/news/regions/rare-dolphins-make-negros-coastal-waters-their-home/|title=Rare dolphins make Negros coastal waters their home|work=GMA News}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The community was named after a large tree called ''“bágo”'' (''[[Gnetum gnemon]]'') under which a native prince Mapagic died according to the writings of a Spanish historian, Diego de Povedano. Another version, however, noted that the name came from the shrub, ''bago-bago'' that grew abundantly in the riverbanks. Around the 17th and 18th centuries, settlers from [[Molo, Iloilo City|Molo, Iloilo]] formed a little village at the mouth of [[Bago River]], presently a rich source of sand and gravel. The village grew into a large settlement prompting its elders to pass a petition for its conversion into a town or ''pueblo'', which was granted in 1800.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bagocity.gov.ph/about-bago-city/|title=About Bago City – Bago City}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Precolonial Times ===
Bago city was already a [[Barangay state]] mentioned in the epic of [[Maragtas]] as a Constituent Barangay of the [[Kedatuan of Madja-as]] and it was settled during and after the victory against Chola-occupied Srivijaya, after the sack of Odtojan; where the compromised Rajahs and Sultans who accepted higher positions by corrupt means were carted off to become slaves, [[Maharlika]], and [[Alipin]] to serve the [[Datu]]s of the Philippines along with the native Ati recruits and Malays who accompanied the siege and reconquest as well as evacuation of Odtojan, where the victorious army and navy returned to the Kedatuan with their war booty.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Abeto |first1=Isidro Escare |title=Philippine history: reassessed / Isidro Escare Abeto. |date=1989 |publisher=Metro Manila :: Integrated Publishing House Ann Arbor, Michigan: University of Michigan Library |page=54 |language=en |chapter=Chapter X - Confederation of Madyaas |quote=Already conceived while he was in Binanua-an, and as the titular head of all the datus left behind by Datu Puti, Datu Sumakwel thought of some kind of system as to how he could exercise his powers given him by Datu Puti over all the other datus under his authority.|oclc=701327689 }}</ref>

=== Spanish Era ===
Its history has its beginning on September 6, 1571, when the Spanish Adelantado, [[Miguel López de Legazpi|Miguel Lopez de Legaspi]], allotted the community to a Spaniard named Juan Gutiérrez de Cortés as his ''"encomienda"''. At that time, the community was still composed of small clusters of settlements along the banks of a big river which later became known as the Bago River. The ''"encomendero"'', since then, administered to the spiritual and socio-economic needs of the natives in the settlements until June 1578; however, a year before that, this community was placed under the evangelical visitations of Fr. Gerónimo Marín, OSA, an [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] priest who had taken charge of the [[Christianization]] of the natives of [[Binalbagan]] since the year 1572.  Father Marín, upon his arrival in the community, celebrated the feast of [[John the Baptist|St. John the Baptist]], who would later be accepted as the patron saint of the place. Following the traditions and practices of the Spanish missionaries and historians in recording the founding of a "''pueblo''" or town that usually coincides with the feast day of a saint and since the feast day of St. John the Baptist, falls on June 24 of each year, it follows thereof that Bago was founded on June 24, 1575. History only records 1575 as the year when Bago was founded so that the exact month and day can only be deduced from such traditional practices of the [[Spaniards]]. [[Manila]], [[Cebu]] and [[Binalbagan]] also predicted the dates of their founding on the same historical situations; hence, the logical conclusion is that Bago was officially founded on the month, day and year heretofore mentioned.<ref name="bagocity.gov.ph">{{Cite web|title = The Birth of a City… {{!}} City of Bago|url = http://www.bagocity.gov.ph/about-bago-city/history-of-bago-city/|website = www.bagocity.gov.ph|access-date = December 6, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222115237/http://www.bagocity.gov.ph/about-bago-city/history-of-bago-city/|archive-date = December 22, 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref>

As regards on how the town acquired its name, according to the manuscript of a Spanish historian, Diego López Povedano, which is available in the library of the University of San Carlos, Cebu City, the town was named after a large tree called "''Bago''" under which, a prince by the name of Mapagic died.

Another historical version is that the place got its name from a shrub called ''"bago-bago"'' which was then growing luxuriantly along the river banks.

=== 17th century ===
From the year 1575 up to the close of the 16th century, no historical account was written about the community. Bago came into the historical scene again when, at early part of the 17th century, a group of settlers settled along the banks of Bago River. The arrival of these settlers merged into a sizable village capable of self- governance. In later years, the descendants of these settlers petitioned the Spanish authorities to declare their village a "pueblo" or town and to name it "Bago". Among the petitioners were Manuel Sitchon, Gregorio Varela, Paulino Torres, Jacinto Araneta, Clemente Celis, Mariano Gonzaga and Fernando Villanueva, whose forebears hailed from the town of Molo, lloilo. The said petition was finally granted by the Spanish authorities in the year 1800; thus, Bago officially attained the status of a "pueblo" or town in that same year.

=== 19th century ===
[[File:Cinco22.jpg|thumb|upright|left|220px|Reenactment of Cinco de Noviembre held annually in Bago]]
Between the years 1800 and 1898, the inhabitants of Bago are among those who suffered tremendously under the Spanish tyranny, injustice and oppression. This social condition finally led to a great revolt on November 5, 1898, when on this day, General Juan Anacleto Araneta rallied his people in the struggle for freedom. This historic event was chronicled in a historical marker found in the city public plaza of Bago which bears the following inscriptions:

{{center|'''''Republica de Negros'''''}}

{{cquote|''In this plaza of Bago was proclaimed the''

''Republica de Negros by the Revolutionary''

''Forces led by General Juan Anacleto Araneta,''

''5 of November, 1898. Witnessed by Ananias''

''Diokno, representative of the Central''

''Revolutionary Government. This Republic''

''acknowledged the authority of the First''

''Philippine Republic under Emilio Aguinaldo.''}}

Together with General Aniceto Lacson who led the forces in Talisay, he was able to force the capitulation of the Spanish garrison at Bacolod thus putting an end to the Spanish sovereignty in the province. Forthwith, a revolutionary government was established with General Juan A. Araneta as the acting governor. The Municipality of Bago, an election was held and Ramon del Castillo became the first elected municipal president who served in such capacity from the year 1898 up to the year 1900.

=== 20th century ===
In April 1901, the Americans came and established a civil government in the province of Negros Occidental which completely abolished the revolutionary government of General Araneta. Bago as one of the towns that were placed under the control of the Americans; however, they allowed the municipality to be governed by [[Filipinos|Filipino]] officials.

When the Japanese forces invaded the Philippines, the civil government of Bago (called Buenos Aires during this time) was dissolved.  The Japanese occupation forces tried to establish a provisional government but the local people refused to cooperate. When the joint American and Filipino forces including recognized guerrillas liberated the town on March 29, 1945, it was completely destroyed but rehabilitation work was immediately started.

Bago was finally granted its cityhood on February 19, 1966, by virtue of Republic Act. No. 4382 with Manuel Y. Torres as the hold-over City Mayor until 1998.

Legal limitations on the number of successive terms disqualified Mayor Manuel Y. Torres in running again as city mayor and in the 1998 local elections, his wife, Janet E. Torres run as candidate for mayor and won. Mayor Janet served Bago as city mayor for three consecutive terms.

Presently, the City of Bago is under the leadership of Mayor Nicholas Yulo.<ref name="bagocity.gov.ph"/>

=== 21st century ===
On July 27, 2018, the city of Bago was awarded at Gawad Kalasag 2018 City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management as 1st Placer under [[Cities of the Philippines|Component City]] Category.
