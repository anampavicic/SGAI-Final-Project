==History==
The area of Nobeoka was part of ancient [[Hyūga Province]], and was called "Agata" from the [[Heian period]] and was ruled by the Tsuchimochi clan for 700 years into the [[Sengoku period]]. In 1587, as a result of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s conquest of Kyushu, Takahashi Motane Takahashi established "Hyūgagata domain" (later [[Nobeoka Domain]]) and constructed [[Nobeoka Castle]] between 1601 and 1603. The center of modern Nobeoka is the former ''[[jōkamachi]]'' of that castle. The place name of "Nobeoka" only dates from the mid-[[Edo period]].
Following the [[Meiji restoration]], the town of Nobeoka was established on May 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. The [[Naito clan]], the former ''[[daimyō]]'' of Nobeoka, had granted the town many privilegesand laid the foundation for modern Nobeoka through development of copper mines and power sources. In 1923, Noguchi Jun built a factory for Nippon Nitrogen Fertilizer (now [[Chisso]]), and Nobeoka developed into one of the prefecture's leading industrial cities. The merger of Nobeoka Town, Tsunetomi Village, and Okatomi Village led to Nobeoka's elevation to city status on February 11, 1933. By 1939, Nobeoka became the city with the largest population in Miyazaki Prefecture.

During [[World War II]], Nobeoka was one of the most important centers of military explosives in Japan.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article970734 | title=Japs Disperse War Plants | newspaper=Argus | date=30 June 1945 }}</ref>  On the night of June 28-29th, 1945, 117 [[United States]] [[B-29]]s fire-bombed the city, destroying 1.35 square km, or 36% of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pacificwrecks.com/60th/1945/6-45.html |title=USAAF CHRONOLOGY JUNE 1945 |website=www.pacificwrecks.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610111437/http://www.pacificwrecks.com/60th/1945/6-45.html |archive-date=2008-06-10}}</ref>  On July 16, 1945, 33 US [[B-24]]s bombed the bridges in around the city, severing the strategically important [[Nippō Main Line]] railway.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.accident-report.com/PUBS/chrono45c.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101005075504/http://accident-report.com/PUBS/chrono45c.html |archive-date=2010-10-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref> With the [[dissolution of the zaibatsu]] after World War II, Nichitsu Konzern was dismantled, and the factory in Nobeoka was restarted as [[Asahi Kasei]].

On February 20, 2006, Nobeoka absorbed the towns of [[Kitakata, Miyazaki|Kitakata]] and [[Kitaura, Miyazaki|Kitaura]] (both from [[Higashiusuki District, Miyazaki|Higashiusuki District]]). On March 31, 2007, the town of [[Kitagawa, Miyazaki|Kitagawa]] (also from [[Higashiusuki District, Miyazaki|Higashiusuki District]]) was also merged into Nobeoka.

==Government==
Nobeoka has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 27 members. Nobeoka contributes five members to the Miyazaki Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the [[Miyazaki 2nd district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
The city's economy depends strongly on the company [[Asahi Kasei]], a producer of synthetic and industrial fibers.  It is known regionally for its [[Ayu sweetfish|Ayu]] fish.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Education==
Nobeoka has 24 public elementary schools, 12 public junior high schools and four combined elementary/junior high schools operated by the city government. The city has five public high schools operated by the Miyazaki Prefectural Board of Education. There are also one private elementary school and 3 private combined middle/high schools. The prefecture operates one special education school for the handicapped. [[Kyushu University of Health and Welfare]], a private university, is located in Nobeoka.

==Transportation==
===Railways===
The [[Kyushu Railway Company]] (JR Kyushu) [[Nippō Main Line]] runs through the city from north to south. Limited express trains stop at [[Nobeoka Station]] and [[Minami-Nobeoka Station]]. It is also directly connected to [[Miyazaki Airport]], and can be reached in approximately 70 minutes using the limited express trains ''Nichirin'' and ''Hyuga''. It takes about two hours to get to Oita Station. Local trains north of Nobeoka Station only make 1.5 round trips a day. The [[Takachiho Line]] used to branch off from Nobeoka Station to [[Takachiho, Miyazaki|Takachiho]], but services were discontinued on September 6, 2005, after flooding triggered by [[Typhoon Nabi]] washed away two bridges on the line, halting all operations.  Efforts to obtain funding for rebuilding were unsuccessful, and the company was liquidated in 2009.<ref>[http://www.yukan-daily.co.jp/news.php?id=5186 高千穂鉄道、清算終了] (''Yukan Daily'', March 29, 2008).
