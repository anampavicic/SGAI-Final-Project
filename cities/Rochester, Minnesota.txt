'''Rochester''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Olmsted County, Minnesota]], United States. It is located along rolling bluffs on the [[Zumbro River]]'s south fork in [[Southeast Minnesota]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rochester |url=https://www.visittheusa.com/destination/rochester-minnesota |access-date=April 2, 2022 |website=Visit The USA}}</ref> At the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], the city had a population of 121,395, making it Minnesota's [[List of cities in Minnesota|third-most populous city]].<ref name="2020 Census (City)">{{cite web|title=Explore Census Data|url=https://data.census.gov/profile/Rochester_city,_Minnesota?g=160XX00US2754880|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=October 14, 2023}}</ref> The [[Rochester metropolitan area, Minnesota| Rochester metropolitan area]], which also includes the nearby rural agricultural areas, had a population of 226,329 in 2020.<ref name="2020Pop">{{cite web|title=2020 Population and Housing State Data |url=https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/2020-population-and-housing-state-data.html |publisher=United States Census Bureau |access-date=September 25, 2021}}</ref> The city is the home and birthplace of [[Mayo Clinic]].

==History==
Several indigenous peoples such as [[Dakota people|Dakota]], [[Ojibway]], and [[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] inhabited the Rochester area.<ref>https://www.rochestermn.gov/about/history-of-rochester {{Bare URL inline|date=August 2024}}</ref> The area developed as a [[stagecoach]] stop between [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]], [[Iowa]] near the Zumbro River. The community was founded by George Head and his wife Henrietta who built a log cabin named Head's Tavern in 1854 and named the city after his hometown of [[Rochester, New York]].<ref>{{cite web| title=History of Rochester| url=https://www.rochestermn.gov/about/history-of-rochester| website=City of Rochester Minnesota| access-date=October 11, 2021}}</ref> When the [[Chicago and North Western Transportation Company|Winona and St Peter Railroad]] initiated service in October 1864, it brought new residents and business opportunities and spurred growth. In 1863, [[William W. Mayo]] arrived as the examining surgeon for [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] draftees in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

===St. Marys Hospital===
[[File:1910StMarysHospitalRochesterMNcopyrightCarlAHolland.jpg|thumb|left|St. Marys Hospital (1910)]]
On August 21, 1883, the [[1883 Rochester Tornado|Great Tornado]] demolished much of Rochester, leaving 37 dead and approximately 200 injured. As there was no medical facility in the immediate area at the time, Mayo and his [[Mayo Clinic#Early years|two sons]] worked together to care for the wounded. Donations of US$60,000 (US$1,932,562 in 2022) were collected and the [[Sisters of Saint Francis of Rochester, Minnesota|Sisters of St. Francis]], assisted by Mayo, opened a new facility named [[Saint Marys Hospital (Rochester)|St. Marys Hospital]] in 1889.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tradition-heritage/tornado-saint-marys.html |title=Tornado Strikes Rochester |publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical and Educational Research}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:SkylineRochesterMNreflectected.JPG|thumb|left|Zumbro River in downtown Rochester]]

Rochester lies alongside the South Fork of the Zumbro River which is {{Convert|57.6|mi|km}} long<ref>{{cite web| title=Zumbro River State Water Trail|  url=https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/watertrails/zumbroriver/index.html| website=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources| access-date=October 11, 2021}}</ref> and is ringed by gentle hills and largely surrounded by farmland within a [[deciduous forest]] [[biome]]. The Zumbro Watershed flows through {{Convert|1,422|mi2|km2}}<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://zumbrowatershed.org/watershed-resources/| title=Watershed Resources| website=Zumbro Watershed Partnership| language=en-US| access-date=January 9, 2019| archive-date=January 10, 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110013842/https://zumbrowatershed.org/watershed-resources/| url-status=dead}}</ref> of agricultural and urban lands. Located in southeast Minnesota, the City of Rochester lies at the western edge of the [[Driftless Area]], a region that was never glaciated and contains deeply-carved river valleys. The rugged terrain is due both to the lack of glacial deposits, or drift, and to the incision of the upper Mississippi River and its tributaries into bedrock. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|54.75|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|54.59|sqmi|sqkm|2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.16|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name="Gazetteer files">{{cite web |title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |website=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=November 13, 2012}}</ref> The city is located {{convert|85|mi|km}} southeast of [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul]].<ref name=Faruquep1>Faruque, p. 1.</ref>

Rochester is in [[Olmsted County, Minnesota|Olmsted County]], one of only four counties in Minnesota without a natural lake. [[Artificial lake]]s exist in the area, including [[Silver Lake (Rochester, Minnesota)|Silver Lake]], a dammed portion of the South Fork Zumbro River just below the convergence with Silver Creek near the city center. Silver Lake was once used as a [[cooling pond]] when the coal-burning [[power plant]] was operated by Rochester Public Utilities at the lake. When operational, the RPU coal plant's heated water output prevented the lake from generally freezing over during the winter months, attracting large numbers of [[Bird migration|migrating]] [[Giant Canada goose|giant Canada geese]]. Large murders of [[crow]]s are known to flock to Rochester during winter, including the Rochester cemetery downtown.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.npr.org/2019/12/05/784728412/this-minnesota-city-has-a-bird-poop-problem-but-the-crow-patrol-is-on-it| title=This Minnesota City Has A Bird Poop Problem, But The Crow Patrol Is On It| date=December 5, 2019| first=Catharine| last=Richert| work=[[Morning Edition]]| publisher=[[NPR]]| access-date=October 11, 2021}}</ref>

Rochester has an extensive parks system, the largest of which are Silver Lake and Soldiers Field in the central part of the city.  A major flood in 1978 led the city to embark on an expensive and successful flood-control project that involved altering many nearby rivers and streams. The Zumbro River flowing through the center of the city is presently being readdressed for increased development and use as part of city planning in conjunction with funding from the Destination Medical Center project.

===Climate===
With a slightly higher altitude and without the [[Urban heat island|UHI]] as the [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul|Twin Cities]], the climate is [[Humid continental climate|warm-summer humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dfb'') even being further south, with warm summers and cold winters.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=44627&cityname=Rochester,+Minnesota,+United+States+of+America&units=metric| title=Rochester, Minnesota Köppen Climate Classification| website=Weatherbase| access-date=May 20, 2019}}</ref> The city features four distinct seasons. Rochester sees on average {{convert|33.02|in|mm}} of rainfall and {{convert|51.9|in|cm}} of snowfall per year. Significant snow accumulation is common during the winter months. Spring and fall are transitional seasons, with a general warming trend during the spring and a general cooling trend during the fall. However, it is not uncommon to see some snowfall during the early month of spring and the later month of fall.<ref name="NOWDataARX" /> Rochester is the second windiest city in the [[United States]], with wind speeds averaging {{Convert|12.6|mph|kph|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.weather.com/tv/shows/amhq/news/10-windiest-large-cities-america-20140408?_escaped_fragment_| title=America's Windiest Cities| last=Erdman| first=Jon| date=November 17, 2014| website=The Weather Channel| language=en| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206084205/http://www.weather.com/tv/shows/amhq/news/10-windiest-large-cities-america-20140408?_escaped_fragment_| archive-date=December 6, 2014| access-date=May 20, 2019}}</ref> January to April are the windiest months on average, according to The Weather Channel. Rochester has been hit by two [[Fujita scale|F4]] tornadoes since 1950 (the first on May 10, 1953, and the other on September 16, 1962).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com| title=Tornado History Project: Maps and Statistics| website=www.tornadohistoryproject.com| access-date=February 12, 2022| archive-date=January 17, 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117024312/http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/| url-status=dead}}</ref> The city has also been hit by two tornadoes in the past decade.

In 2013, Governor [[Mark Dayton]] signed a bill known as Destination Medical Center (DMC). It intends to increase Minnesota's tax base, and promote business and economic growth throughout the state.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic/destination-medical-center-dmc| title=Destination Medical Center (DMC)| website=Mayo Clinic}}</ref> Because of this legislation, The Mayo Clinic will invest in $3.5 billion to upgrade patient rooms, add additional workspace, and build research and administrative buildings.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mprnews.org/story/2013/05/23/business/mayo-clinic| title=Mayo Clinic celebrates state funding approval, but questions remain on expansion details| first=Elizabeth| last=Baier| date=May 23, 2013| website=Minnesota Public Radio News}}</ref>

The main developments of this plan will be in the DMC sub-districts. The ''Downtown Waterfront'' district will cover The Government Center, The Civic Center, and most areas near the [[Zumbro River]]. The ''Central Station'' district includes Central Park and most of Civic Center Drive, aimed to become a transportation hub of the city. ''St. Marys Place'' will cover St. Marys hospital and St. Marys Park, as well as most of 2nd Street. The ''Heart of the City'' will feature the Mayo Clinic campus and major residential, commercial, and retail companies. The ''Discovery Square'' area will include scientific and technology research facilities.

===Quarry Hill===
The foundation of Rochester State Hospital began in 1875 as the Minnesota Inebriate Asylum funded by a tax on liquor dealers. Land was purchased in 1876 and construction began in 1877, including the building of a hospital and the park nearby which was used by the patients and their families. In 1965, the park was transferred from the hospital to the state for the use of general public and since then there have been various developments in the park including the laying of paved trails. The {{convert|329|acre|ha|abbr=on|adj=on}} park contains over {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} of paved and hiking trails, a pond, and a historical sandstone cave carved in 1882. This soft St. Peter sand stone cave was dug in the late 1800's to store food for the patients of the state hospital. The cave was later abandoned with the invention of modern refrigerators, and is now a historic site.

Quarry Hill Nature Center is the center stone of the Quarry Hill Park in Rochester. The Nature Center opened in 1973, and was expanded in 1990. In 2017, the facility added additional [[nordic skiing]]. These facilities include modern educational facilities, and a 19th-century prairie style home where skis and snow shoes could be rented.<ref name=qhnc>{{cite web| url=https://www.qhnc.org/history.html| title=History| website=Quarry Hill Nature Center| access-date=October 11, 2021}}</ref>
