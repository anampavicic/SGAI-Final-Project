'''Trece Martires''' ({{IPA|tl|ˈtɾɛː.sɛ ˌmaːɾ.tɪˈɾɛs|}}), officially the '''City of Trece Martires''' ({{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Trece Martires}}), is a 1st class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]]  and ''[[de facto]]'' capital city of the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Cavite]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 210,503 people.{{PH census|current}}

The city was the provincial capital of Cavite until President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] transferred it to [[Imus]] on June 11, 1977. Despite the capital's relocation, the city still hosts the majority of the offices of the provincial government and some national-level agencies.

== Etymology ==
Trece Martires, which is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "thirteen martyrs", is named after the [[Thirteen Martyrs of Cavite]]—a group of prominent Caviteños convicted of rebellion and executed by the [[Captaincy General of the Philippines|Spanish colonial government]] on September 12, 1896, in [[Cavite City|Cavite Puerto (present-day Cavite City)]] during the [[Philippine Revolution]].<ref>[http://www.philippinemasonry.org/the-thirteen-martyrs-of-cavite.html "The Thirteen Martyrs of Cavite"].

==History==

===Township===
Trece Martires started as one of the largest and most remote barrios of Cavite. Originally named ''Quinta'' or ''Quintana'', it was part of the municipality of [[Tanza]]. The land was basically agricultural subdivided into cattle ranches and sugar farms, with less than 1,000 hectares, at the intersection of the present Tanza–Trece Martires–Indang Road ([[Tanza–Trece Martires Road]] / [[Trece Martires–Indang Road]]) and the Naic–Dasmariñas Road (now part of [[Governor's Drive]]).<ref name="Cavite">[http://www.cavite.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=227&Itemid=158 "Trece Martires City – Brief History"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208085417/http://www.cavite.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=227&Itemid=158 |date=February 8, 2012 }}.

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
The city was established on May 24, 1954, under ''Republic Act No. 981'' ("The Charter of Trece Martires City") as approved by [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ramon Magsaysay]]. The Republic Act also transferred the provincial seat of government from [[Cavite City]] to Trece Martires.<ref name="RA981">{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra981-city-charter-of-trece-martires.html|title=An Act Establishing the New Capital of the Province of Cavite, and Providing a Charter Therefor, and for Other Purposes|publisher=LawPH.com|access-date=April 9, 2011}}</ref> The original bill, ''House Bill 1795'', was authored by Congressman Jose T. Cajulis (1954–1957) and Senator Justiniano S. Montano (1949–1956).

Under the city charter, the [[Governor of Cavite]] is ''[[ex-officio]]'' mayor of Trece Martires; then-Governor Dominador Mangubat was installed as the city's first chief executive. On January 2, 1956, the provincial capital was formally inaugurated, the same day when Delfin N. Montano (the son of former [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]] Justiniano Montano) was sworn into office as the new governor. He served in both offices from 1956 to 1971.<ref name="Cavite"/>

On June 22, 1957, the original act was amended by ''Republic Act No. 1912'' increasing its territory to {{convert|3917|ha|sqm}}, more or less. Consequently, the municipalities of [[Indang, Cavite|Indang]] and [[General Trias]] had to yield parts of their respective areas to this territorial expansion.<ref>[http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno1912.html "Republic Act No. 1912"]. Chan Robles Virtual Law Library. Retrieved on June 11, 2012.</ref>

The provincial-local power company was established in 1957, as the Cavite Electricity Distribution Authority.<ref>{{cite web |title=Republic Act No. 2046 |url=https://lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1957/ra_2046_1957.html |website=lawphil.net |access-date=6 November 2023}}</ref> The company would later also manage communications infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web |title=Republic Act No. 2235 |url=https://jurist.ph/laws/amendments-to-r-a-no-2046-creation-of-cavite-electricity-distributing-authority |website=Jurist AI {{!}} Generative AI for Legal Research in the Philippines |access-date=6 November 2023 |language=en}}</ref>

The city high school was established in 1966, becoming nationalized later in 1983.

===1970s to 1990s===
On June 11, 1977, President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] signed Presidential Decree No. 1163, relocating the capital and seat of government of Cavite from Trece Martires to the municipality of [[Imus]], a fact that remains true up to now.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=PD|number=1163, s. 1977|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1977/06/11/presidential-decree-no-1163-s-1977/|title=Transferring the Capital and Seat of Government of the Province of Cavite From Trece Martires City to the Municipality of Imus|date=June 11, 1977|accessdate=June 8, 2024|publisher=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette]]}}</ref> Cavite Governor [[Juanito Remulla]] requested Marcos in September 1979 to transfer the capital back to the city, but his request was denied. However, the city still hosts majority of provincial and national-level agency offices, making it the ''de facto'' capital of Cavite.

Since establishment, the city never elected its own mayor. In January 1988, the city attempted to elect its own local officials to run the affairs of the city and ease the burden of the ex-officio city officials. However, it was denied by the Supreme Court Resolution dated January 12, 1988.<ref>{{cite web |title=Trece Martires City - History |url=https://www.trecemartirescity.gov.ph/the-city |website=www.trecemartirescity.gov.ph |access-date=6 November 2023}}</ref>

In the 1990 Census, the city breached 15,000 residents, almost double the last number from the previous census in 1980. 

On March 31, 1992, President [[Corazon Aquino]] signed Republic Act No. 7325, which amended the charter of Trece Martires, allowing the city to vote their own local officials for the first time. Prudencio Panganiban became Trece Martires' first mayor-elect.<ref>[http://philippinelaw.info/statutes/ra7325.html "Republic Act No. 7325"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601122346/http://philippinelaw.info/statutes/ra7325.html |date=June 1, 2012 }}.

From 2000 to 2007, Trece Martires more than doubled its population from 40,000 to 90,000, making it the fastest growing city in the country during that period. <ref name="2007-pop-cen-faqs">{{cite web |title=2007 Census of Population: Frequently Asked Questions |url=https://psada.psa.gov.ph/catalog/16/download/95 |website=Philippine Statistics Authority |access-date=6 November 2023 |archive-date=November 6, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231106035423/https://psada.psa.gov.ph/catalog/16/download/95 |url-status=bot: unknown }}</ref> The succeeding years also followed this trend. It was caused by the influx of new residents choosing to live in its private subdivisions. This growth coincided with the opening of new industrial estates in nearby [[General Trias]] and [[Dasmariñas]], namely  New Cavite Industrial City, First Cavite Industrial Estate and Gateway Business Park, which hosted an Intel plant starting 1997.<ref>{{cite web |title=Philippine President Fidel Ramos Opens First Intel Facility in Cavite |url=https://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/1997/AW040897.HTM |website=www.intel.com |access-date=6 November 2023}}</ref>

The city sustained this population boom from 2014 onwards, led by the construction of resettlement sites around the city. The [[National Housing Authority (Philippines)|National Housing Authority]], for instance, built 19,000 housing units for relocatees from the [[National Capital Region (Philippines)|National Capital Region]] to reside in.
