Covering 9,965 square kilometers, Kinshasa stretches along the southern shores of the [[Pool Malebo]], on the [[Congo River]]. It forms an expansive crescent across flat, low-lying terrain at an average altitude of about 300 meters.<ref name=":3" /> Situated between latitudes 4° and 5° and longitudes East 15° and 16°32, Kinshasa shares its borders with the [[Mai-Ndombe Province]], [[Kwilu Province]], and [[Kwango|Kwango Province]] to the east; the [[Congo River]] delineates its western and northern perimeters, constituting a [[natural border]] with the [[Republic of the Congo]]; to the south lies the [[Kongo Central|Kongo Central Province]]. Across the river sits [[Brazzaville]], the smaller capital of the neighboring Republic of the Congo, forming the world's second-closest pair of capital cities despite being separated by a four-kilometer-wide unbridged span of the Congo River.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Buron |first=Thierry |date=2020-11-22 |title=Brazzaville et Kinshasa : proches, mais séparées |url=https://www.revueconflits.com/brazaville-et-kinshasa-proches-mais-separes/ |access-date=2023-12-15 |website=Conflits : Revue de Géopolitique |language=fr-FR |archive-date=15 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231215134251/https://www.revueconflits.com/brazaville-et-kinshasa-proches-mais-separes/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Academie |first=Jan Van Eyck |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_zFUAAAAMAAJ |title=Brakin: Brazzaville-Kinshasa : Visualizing the Visible |date=2006-06-12 |publisher=Lars Müller Publishers |isbn=978-3-03778-076-3 |location=Baden, Switzerland |language=en |access-date=30 August 2023 |archive-date=16 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231016114545/https://books.google.com/books?id=_zFUAAAAMAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite news |last=Burke |first=Jason |date=2017-01-17 |title=Face-off over the Congo: the long rivalry between Kinshasa and Brazzaville |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jan/17/congo-rivalry-kinshasa-brazzaville-river-drc |access-date=2023-08-29 |issn=0261-3077 |archive-date=18 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170718224203/https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jan/17/congo-rivalry-kinshasa-brazzaville-river-drc |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Toponymy ==
The origin of the name ''Kinshasa'' is rooted in multiple theories proposed by scholars. Paul Raymaekers, an [[anthropologist]] and [[Ethnology|ethnologist]], suggests that the name derives from the combination of the [[Kongo language|Kikongo]] and Kihumbu languages.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |last1=Kinyamba |first1=S.

According to Raymackers, ''Kinshasa'' was a significant trading site where people from the Lower Congo (now [[Kongo Central|Kongo Central Province]]) and [[Atlantic Ocean|South Atlantic Ocean]] exchanged salt for goods like [[iron]], [[Slavery|slaves]] and [[ivory]] brought by those from the Upper Congo (now [[Tshopo Province]]).<ref name=":3" /> However, Hendrik van Moorsel, an anthropologist, historian and researcher, proposes that [[Teke people|Bateke]] [[Fisherman|fishermen]] traded fish for cassava with locals along the riverbank, and the place of this exchange was called "''Ulio''".<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":5">{{Cite book |last=Moorsel |first=Hendrik van |title=Atlas de préhistoire de la plaine de Kinshasa |publisher=Université Lovanium |year=1968 |location=Kinshasa, Belgian Congo |language=French}}</ref> In [[Teke languages|Teke]], "exchange" is "''Utsaya''", and "place of exchange" is "''Intsaya''". Thus, the name evolved from ''Ulio'' to ''Intsaya'', and later, under the influence of Kikongo, transformed into ''Kintsaya'', eventually becoming ''Kinshasa''.<ref name=":3" /> ''Kinshasa'', also known as ''N'shasa'', is regarded as the primary "place of exchange" on the southern bank of the [[Pool Malebo]], where [[barter]]ing occurred even before the commercial boom of [[Kintambo]].<ref name=":3" />

The name ''Nshasa'' is believed to originate from the Teke verb "''tsaya''" (''tsaa''), meaning "to exchange", and the noun "''intsaya''" (''insaa''), referring to any market or place of exchange. It was at this location that Teke [[broker]]s traded ivory and slaves from the [[Banunu people|Banunu]] slave traders, often mistaken for the [[Yanzi people|Yanzi]], for European trade items brought by the [[Zombo people|Zombo]] and [[Kongo people|Kongo]] people.<ref name=":3" /> Despite the various theories, the historical name of ''Kinshasa'' is known to have been ''Nshasa'', as documented by [[Henry Morton Stanley]] during his crossing of [[Africa]] from [[Zanzibar]] to [[Boma, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Boma]] in 1874–1877 when he mentioned visiting "the king of Nshasa" on 14 March 1877.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":6">{{Cite book |last=Boya |first=Loso Kiteti |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hpi4lyWG7zwC |title=D.R.

Prior to the establishment of  Kinshasa, the area was for a time part of the [[Anziku Kingdom]]. By about 1698, it had become an essentially independent domain known as [[Nkonkobela]].<ref>John K. Thornton. ''History of West Central Africa''. Cambridge University Press, 2020. p. 208</ref>

The city was established as a trading post by [[Henry Morton Stanley]] in 1881.<ref>Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 144</ref> It was named Léopoldville in honor of Stanley's employer [[Leopold II of the Belgians|King Leopold II of the Belgians]]. He would then proceed to take  control of most of the [[Congo Basin]] as the [[Congo Free State]], not as a colony but as his private property. The post flourished as the first navigable port on the Congo River above [[Livingstone Falls]], a series of rapids over {{convert|300|km|abbr=off}} below Leopoldville. At first, all goods arriving by sea or being sent by sea had to be carried by porters between Léopoldville and [[Matadi]], the port below the rapids and {{cvt|150|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the coast. The completion of the [[Matadi-Kinshasa Railway|Matadi-Kinshasa]] [[portage railway]], in 1898, provided an alternative route around the rapids and sparked the rapid development of Léopoldville. In 1914, a pipeline was installed so that crude oil could be transported from Matadi to the upriver steamers in Leopoldville.<ref name="britannica.com">{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Kinshasa – national capital, Democratic Republic of the Congo |encyclopedia=britannica.com |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/318863/Kinshasa/9050/History |access-date=25 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018021639/https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/318863/Kinshasa/9050/History |archive-date=18 October 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> By 1923, the city was elevated to capital of the [[Belgian Congo]], replacing the town of [[Boma, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Boma]] in the Congo estuary, pursuant to the Royal Decree of 1 July 1923, countersigned by the [[Minister of the Colonies (Belgium)|Minister of the Colonies]], Louis Franc.<ref name=":3" /><ref name="britannica.com" /> Before this, Léopoldville was designated an "urban district", encompassing exclusively the [[Communes of Kinshasa|communes]] of [[Kintambo]] and the current [[Gombe, Kinshasa|Gombe]], which burgeoned around [[Ngaliema Bay]].<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite book |last=Moulin |first=Léon de Saint |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gEWQYgEACAAJ |title=Les anciens villages des environs de Kinshasa |date=1971 |publisher=Université Lovanium |location=Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo |language=fr |access-date=9 April 2024 |archive-date=25 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240525162455/https://books.google.com/books?id=gEWQYgEACAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":9">{{Cite web |last=Luaka |first=Evrard Nkenku |date=2005 |title=La gestion et la gouvernance des déchets dans la ville-province de Kinshasa |trans-title=Waste management and governance in the city-province of Kinshasa |url=https://www.memoireonline.com/05/07/461/m_gestion-gouvernance-dechets-ville-province-kinshasa5.html |access-date=2024-04-09 |publisher=University of Kinshasa |language=fr |publication-place=Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo |archive-date=9 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240409114108/https://www.memoireonline.com/05/07/461/m_gestion-gouvernance-dechets-ville-province-kinshasa5.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Then the communes of [[Kinshasa (commune)|Kinshasa]], [[Barumbu]], and [[Lingwala]] emerged.

The urban populace swelled in 1945 with the cessation of [[Forced labour|forced labor]], facilitating the influx of native Africans from rural regions. Léopoldville then became predominantly inhabited by the [[Kongo people|Bakongo]] ethnic group.<ref name=":9" />

In the 1950s, [[Planned community|planned urban centers]] such as [[Lemba, Kinshasa|Lemba]], [[Matete]], and a segment of Ndjili were established to accommodate workers from the [[Limete]] industrial zone.<ref name=":9" /> [[Lovanium University]], the colony's inaugural university, was founded in 1954.<ref name=":9" /> By 1957, Léopoldville comprised eleven communes and six adjunct regions: [[Kalamu]], [[Kasa-Vubu, Kinshasa|Dendale]] (present-day [[Kasa-Vubu, Kinshasa|Kasa-Vubu commune]]), [[Lingwala|Saint Jean]] (now [[Lingwala]]), [[Ngiri-Ngiri]], [[Kintambo]], [[Limete]], [[Bandalungwa]], [[Gombe, Kinshasa|Léopoldville]] (current [[Gombe, Kinshasa|Gombe]]), [[Barumbu]], [[Kinshasa (commune)|Kinshasa]], and [[Ngaliema]]; along with the adjunct regions of Lemba, [[Binza group|Binza]], [[Makala]], [[Kimwenza]], [[Kimbanseke]], and Kingasani.

Kinshasa grew rapidly under Mobutu, drawing people from across the country who came in search of their fortunes or to escape ethnic strife elsewhere, thus adding to the many ethnicities and languages already found there.

In 1991 the city had to [[1991 Zaire unrest|fend off rioting soldiers]], who were protesting the government's failure to pay them.

The Congo River is the second longest river in Africa after the [[Nile]] and has the continent's greatest [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]]. As a [[waterway]] it provides a means of transport for much of the [[Congo Basin]]; it is navigable for river barges between Kinshasa and [[Kisangani]]; many of its tributaries are also navigable. The river is an important source of [[hydroelectric power]], and downstream from Kinshasa it has the potential to generate power equivalent to the usage of roughly half of Africa's population.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Wachter |first=Sarah J. |date=19 June 2007 |title=Giant dam projects aim to transform African power supplies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/19/business/worldbusiness/19iht-rnrghydro.1.6204822.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101175527/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/19/business/worldbusiness/19iht-rnrghydro.1.6204822.html |archive-date=1 November 2011 |access-date=15 December 2010 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

Topographically, Kinshasa has a [[marsh]]y, [[alluvial plain]], with altitudes ranging from 275 to 300 meters, along with hilly terrain that elevates from 310 to 370 meters.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NnQQBAAAQBAJ&dq=Kinshasa+alluvial+plain&pg=PA147 |title=Agriculture in Urban Planning: Generating Livelihoods and Food Security |date=2012-05-16 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-1-136-57205-0 |editor-last=Redwood |editor-first=Mark |location=Thames, Oxfordshire United Kingdom |pages=8 |language=en |access-date=2 May 2024 |archive-date=25 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240525162459/https://books.google.com/books?id=NnQQBAAAQBAJ&dq=Kinshasa+alluvial+plain&pg=PA147#v=onepage&q=Kinshasa%20alluvial%20plain&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":10" /><ref>{{Cite book |last= |first= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pVutDwAAQBAJ&dq=Kinshasa+alluvial+plain&pg=PA32 |title=Congo Republic Energy Policy, Laws and Regulations Handbook - Strategic Information and Basic Laws |date=2017-11-22 |publisher=Global Pro Info USA |isbn=978-1-5145-1238-8 |location=Miami, Florida, United States |pages=32 |language=en |access-date=2 May 2024 |archive-date=25 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240525162526/https://books.google.com/books?id=pVutDwAAQBAJ&dq=Kinshasa+alluvial+plain&pg=PA32#v=onepage&q=Kinshasa%20alluvial%20plain&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref> The city has four principal features: the Malebo Pool, a vast expanse of water with islands and islets; the Kinshasa Plain, which is a highly [[Urban area|urbanizable space]], but susceptible to drainage issues; the Terrace, which is a series of low ridges overlooking the plain; and the Hills Area, which is characterized by deep valleys and [[cirque]]-shaped formations.<ref name=":10" />

The Malebo Pool spans over 35 kilometers in length and 25 kilometers in width and is encircled by [[Ngaliema|Ngaliema Municipality]] to the west and [[Maluku, Kinshasa|Maluku Municipality]] to the east, traversing through [[Gombe, Kinshasa|Gombe]], [[Barumbu]], [[Limete]], [[Masina, Kinshasa|Masina]], and [[Nsele]] municipalities.<ref name=":10" /> The Kinshasa Plain has a banana-like shape and is surrounded by eastward-oriented hills. Its low sandy alluvial masses extend from Maluku Municipality in the east to the western foothills of Ngaliema, covering approximately 20,000 hectares.<ref name=":10" />

The Terrace is mainly situated in the city's western expanse, between [[Ndjili, Kinshasa|N'djili]] and [[Mont Ngafula|Mount Ngafula]]. It comprises stony blocks of soft [[sandstone]] and [[Silicon dioxide|silica]]-covered yellow [[clay]], topped with brown [[silt]], and ranges from 10 to 25 meters in height. It retains vestiges of an ancient surface.<ref name=":10" /> The Hills Area commences several kilometers from the Malebo Pool and is characterized by deep valleys and cirque-shaped formations. These hills reach heights surpassing 700 meters and exhibit gentle, rounded contours sculpted by local rivers.<ref name=":10" /> While their eastern counterparts may reflect remnants of the [[Batéké Plateau]], their origins in the west and south remain enigmatic. Their natural [[erosion]] processes are exacerbated by human intervention, sometimes assuming catastrophic proportions.<ref name=":10" />

=== Geology ===
Geologically, the soil in Kinshasa is of the Arenoferrasol category,<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ca66AAAAIAAJ&q=Kinshasa%20Arenoferrasol |title=Monographie de la province du Maniema |date=1998 |publisher=République démocratique du Congo, Ministères de l'agriculture et de l'élevage |location=Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo |pages=9 |language=fr |access-date=2 May 2024 |archive-date=25 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240525162500/https://books.google.com/books?id=ca66AAAAIAAJ&q=Kinshasa%20Arenoferrasol |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lgouAAAAIAAJ&q=Kinshasa%20Arenoferrasol |title=African Soils: Volumes 16-18 |publisher=Commission Scientifique, technique et de la recherche de l'Organisation de l'unité Africaine |year=1971 |location=Paris, France |pages=169 |language=en |access-date=20 May 2024 |archive-date=25 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240525163002/https://books.google.com/books?id=lgouAAAAIAAJ&q=Kinshasa%20Arenoferrasol |url-status=live }}</ref> characterized by fine [[sand]]s with a clay content typically below 20%, low [[organic matter]], and absorbent complex saturation.<ref name=":10" /> The basement is composed of [[Precambrian]] [[bedrock]], featuring finely stratified red sandstone often infused with [[feldspar]]. This rock is visible at the rapids' base near [[Mount Stanley|Mount Ngaliema]] and south of the [[Ndjili River|N'djili River]], and effectively withstands erosive forces.<ref name=":10" />

=== Vegetation ===
[[File:Sunset in the Democratic Republic of Congo2.jpg|thumb|231x231px|A view of Congo River from Kinshasa]]

Kinshasa's vegetation comprises gallery [[forest]]s, [[Fairy circle (arid grass formation)|grassy formations]], [[Ruderal species|ruderal plant]] groups, and [[Aquatic ecosystem|aquatic formations]]. These gallery forests, found along the main watercourses within humid valleys of the Congolese guinéo ombrophile type, have degraded into highly exploited pre-forest fallows, manifesting as reclusive foresters of varying ages.<ref name=":10" /> Ruderal plant groups line railway tracks within narrow strips, reflecting the region's vegetation cover's discontinuity and repetition. Kinshasa is home to diverse vegetation types, each intricately linked to specific ecological parameters.<ref name=":10" />

=== Residential and commercial areas ===
Kinshasa is a city of sharp contrasts, with affluent residential and commercial areas and three universities alongside sprawling slums.<ref name="Flouriot2013">Jean Flouriot, "[https://com.revues.org/6770 Kinshasa 2005.

Urban planning in post-independence Kinshasa has been limited. The ''Mission Française d'Urbanisme'' drew up some plans in the 1960s which envisioned a greater role for [[automobile]] transportation but did not predict the city's significant population growth. Thus much of the [[urban structure]] has developed without guidance from a master plan. According to [[UN-Habitat]], the city is expanding by eight square kilometers per year. It describes many of the new neighborhoods as [[slum]]s, built in unsafe conditions with inadequate infrastructure.<ref name=ChirisaEtAl2017 /> Nevertheless, spontaneously developed areas have in many cases extended the [[grid plan|grid street plan]] of the original city.<ref name=Flouriot2013 />

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Communes of Kinshasa}}

Kinshasa is both a city (''ville'' in French) and a province, one of the 26 [[provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Nevertheless, it has city subdivisions and is divided into 24 [[Communes of Kinshasa|commune]]s (municipalities), which in turn are divided into 369 quarters and 21 embedded groupings.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Commission Électorale Nationale Indépendante |author-link=Independent National Electoral Commission (Democratic Republic of the Congo) |title=La Cartographie Electorale des 26 Provinces—Kinshasa |url=https://www.ceni.cd/cartographie-electorale/provinces/kinshasa |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181028000421/http://www.ceni.cd/cartographie-electorale/provinces/kinshasa |archive-date=28 October 2018 |access-date=18 April 2020 |website=www.ceni.cd |language=fr}}</ref> [[Maluku, Kinshasa|Maluku]], the rural commune to the east of the urban area, accounts for 79% of the {{cvt|9.965|km2}} total land area of the city-province,<ref name="area" /> with a population of 200,000–300,000.<ref name=Flouriot2013 /> The communes are grouped into four districts which are not in themselves administrative divisions.

===Climate===
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Kinshasa has a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] (''Aw''). Its lengthy rainy season spans from October through May, with a relatively short dry season, between June and September. Kinshasa lies south of the [[equator]], so its dry season begins around its winter solstice, which is in June. This is in contrast to African cities further north featuring this climate where the dry season typically begins around December. Kinshasa's dry season is slightly cooler than its wet season, though temperatures remain relatively constant throughout the year.

A third factor is simply a demographic one. At least one in ten Congolese live in Kinshasa. With its population exceeding eleven million, it is the second-largest city in sub-Saharan Africa (after Lagos). It is also the second-largest French-speaking city in the world, according to Paris (even though only a small percentage of Kinois speak French correctly),</ref> Although [[Lingala]] is widely used as a spoken language, French is the language of street signs, posters, newspapers, government documents, schools; it dominates plays, television, and the press, and it is used in vertical relationships among people of different social classes. People of the same class, however, speak the Congolese languages ([[Kongo language|Kikongo]], [[Lingala]], [[Tshiluba]] or [[Swahili language|Swahili]]) among themselves.<ref name="Manning">{{Cite book |last=Manning |first=Patrick |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwzFF2FnbzMC&q=Kinshasa+second+largest+francophone+city&pg=PA189 |title=Francophone sub-Saharan Africa: Democracy and Dependence, 1985–1995 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |isbn=9780521645195 |location=London and New York |page=189 |access-date=31 May 2009}}{{Dead link|date=May 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

While the culture is dominated by the Francophonie, a complex multilingualism is present in Kinshasa. Many in the francophonie of the 1980s labelled Zaïre as the second-largest francophone country, and Kinshasa as the second-largest francophone city. Yet Zaïre seemed unlikely to escape a complex multilingualism. Lingala was the language of music, of presidential addresses, of daily life in government and in Kinshasa. But if Lingala was the spoken language of Kinshasa, it made little progress as a written language. French was the written language of the city, as seen in street signs, posters, newspapers and in government documents. French dominated plays and television as well as the press; French was the language of the national anthem and even for the doctrine of authenticity. Zairian researchers found French to be used in vertical relationships among people of uneven rank; people of equal rank, no matter how high, tended to speak Zairian languages among themselves. Given these limits, French might have lost its place to another of the leading languages of Zaïre – Lingala, Tshiluba, or [[Swahili language|Swahili]] – except that teaching of these languages also suffered from limitations on its growth.</ref> Kinshasa hosted the 14th [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|Francophonie]] Summit in October 2012.<ref>{{Cite web |title=XIVe Sommet de la Francophonie |url=http://www.francophonie.org/XIVe-Sommet-de-la-Francophonie,36849.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619065536/http://www.francophonie.org/XIVe-Sommet-de-la-Francophonie,36849.html |archive-date=19 June 2012 |access-date=25 June 2012 |publisher=[[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|OIF]]}}</ref>

Most of the media use French and Lingala to a large extent; very few use the other national languages.

== Sports ==
[[Sports]], especially [[association football|football]] and [[martial arts]] are popular in Kinshasa. The city is home to the country's national stadium, the [[Stade des Martyrs]] (Stadium of the Martyrs). The [[AS Vita Club|Vita Club]], [[DC Motema Pembe|Daring Club Motema Pembe]] and [[AS Dragons (Kinshasa)|AS Dragons]] frequently draws large crowds, enthusiastic and sometimes rowdy, to the Stade des Martyrs. [[Dojo]]s are popular and their owners influential.<ref name=Trapido2016 />

In 1974, Kinshasa hosted [[The Rumble in the Jungle]] boxing match between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[George Foreman]], in which Ali defeated Foreman, to regain the World [[Heavyweight]] title.

==Buildings and institutions==
[[File:Palais du peuple de la RDC.jpg|thumb|The People's Palace, seat of the Congolese parliament]]

Kinshasa is home to the [[Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] including:

* the [[Palais de la Nation (Kinshasa)|Palais de la Nation]], home of the [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|President]], in Gombe;
* the [[Palais du Peuple (Kinshasa)|Palais du Peuple]], meeting place of both houses of Parliament, [[Senate (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|Senate]] and [[National Assembly (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|National Assembly]], in [[Lingwala]];
* the [[Palais de Justice (Kinshasa)|Palais de Justice]], in Gombe;
* the [[Cité de l'OUA]], built for the [[Organization of African Unity]] in the 1970s and now serving government functions, in [[Ngaliema]].

The [[Central Bank of the Congo]] has its headquarters on Boulevard Colonel Tshatshi, across the street from the Mausoleum of Laurent Kabila and the presidential palace.

The quartier [[Matonge (Kinshasa)|Matonge]] is known regionally for its [[Nightlife (activity)|nightlife]].

Notable features of the city include the Gecamines Commercial Building (formerly SOZACOM) and [[Hotel Memling]] skyscrapers; [[L'ONATRA]], the impressive building of the Ministry of Transport; the central market; the [[Limete Tower]]. The face of Kinshasa is changing as new buildings are being built on the Boulevard du 30 Juin: Crown Tower (on Batetela) and Congofutur Tower.

== Infrastructure and housing ==
[[File:2013 Boulevard du 30 Juin Kinshasa 8756682965.jpg|thumb|Road of Kinshasa City]]

The city's infrastructure for [[Tap water|running water]] and electricity is generally in bad shape.<ref>Nzuzi (2008), p. 14.</ref> The [[electric power distribution|electrical network]] is in disrepair to the extent that prolonged and periodic [[power outage|blackouts]] are normal, and exposed [[electrical wiring|lines]] sometimes electrify pools of rainwater.<ref name=Trapido2016 /><ref name=Flouriot2013 />

[[Regideso]], the national public company with primary responsibility for water supply in the Congo, serves Kinshasa only incompletely, and without uniform quality. 
Other areas are served by decentralized ''Associations des Usagers des Réseau d'Eau Potable'' (ASUREPs).<ref name="Bédécarrats2016" /> Gombe uses water at a high rate (306 liters per day per inhabitant) compared to other communes (from 71 L/d/i in Kintambo down to 2 L/d/i in Kimbanseke).<ref name="Flouriot2013" />

The city is estimated to produce 6,300 m<sup>3</sup> of trash and 1,300 m<sup>3</sup> of industrial waste per day, with little to no capacity for disposal.<ref name="Flouriot2013" />

The housing market has seen rising prices and [[Renting|rent]]s since the 1980s. Houses and apartments in the central area are expensive, with houses selling for a million dollars and apartments going for $5000 per month. High prices have spread outward from the central area as owners and renters move out of the most expensive part of the city. [[Gated communities]] and shopping malls, built with foreign capital and technical expertise, began to appear in 2006. [[Urban renewal]] projects have led in some cases to violent conflict and displacement.<ref name=Trapido2016 /><ref>Aurélie Fontaine, "Housing: Kinshasa is for the rich”; ''Africa Report'' 5 May 2015.</ref> The high prices leave incoming refugees with few options for settlement besides illegal [[shantytown]]s such as Pakadjuma.<ref name=Iazzolino2016 />

In 2005, 55% of households had televisions and 43% had mobile phones. 11% had refrigerators and 5% had cars.<ref name=Flouriot2013 />

[[File:Boulevard du 30 juin, Kinshasa.jpg|thumb|The [[Boulevard du 30 Juin]] provides an artery to the business district in [[La Gombe|Gombe, Kinshasa]].]]

The city-province has 5000&nbsp;km of roadways, 10% of which are paved. The [[Boulevard du 30 Juin]] (Boulevard of 30 June) links the main areas of the central district of the city. Other roads also converge on Gombe. The east–west road network linking the more distant neighborhoods is weak and thus transit through much of the city is difficult.<ref name=Flouriot2013 /> The quality of roads has improved somewhat, developed in part with loans from China, since 2000.<ref name=Trapido2016 />

===Air===
The city has two airports: [[N'djili Airport]] (FIH) is the main airport with connections to other African countries as well as to Istanbul, Brussels, Paris and some other destinations. [[N'Dolo Airport]], located close to downtown, is used for domestic flights only with small turboprop aircraft.

[[File:Kinshasa train station (21237028852).jpg|thumb|A memorial at [[Gare de l'Est, Kinshasa|Kinshasa train station]] remembering those who died during the construction of the railroad]]

The [[Matadi–Kinshasa Railway]] connects Kinshasa with [[Matadi]], Congo's Atlantic port. The line reopened in September 2015 after around a decade without regular service. There is an intermittent service, with a poor safety record.

According to the [[Société commerciale des transports et des ports|Société Commerciale des Transports et des Ports]] (SCTP), the Matadi-Kinshasa Railway (CFMK) has the highest transport of goods in import, 8 746 tonnes in January, 11,318 tonnes in February 10,032 tonnes in March, 7,244 tonnes in April, 5,024 tonnes in March and 7,745 tonnes in June. The monthly tonnage of exported goods reached only 1,000 tonnes in the month of March 2018. In January some 284 tonnes of goods were exported from the ports of Boma and Matadi, via the railway, and 711 tonnes in February, then 1,058 tonnes in March, 684 tonnes in April, 818 tonnes in May and 853 tonnes in June.

The monthly statistics for passenger traffic are as follows: 2,294 persons in January, 1,836 in February, 2065 in March, 2,660 in April, 1,952 in May and 2,660 in June.

The line connecting the port of Matadi to Kinshasa is 366&nbsp;km long. Its distance has been since 3111 of 3112 feet or 42 inches (lane capped 1,067 meter): This railway belongs, in fact, to the [[Société nationale des chemins de fer du Congo|National Railway Company of the Congo]] (''Société nationale des chemins de fer du Congo''; SNCC). It is only exploited by the SCTP, formerly ONATRA, according to an agreement signed by the two companies.

This line lost large shares of the market, following its lamentable state, insecurity on the rails (some trains are attacked), and the rehabilitation of the road along the rails in 2000. According to Congolese sources, an agreement with a Chinese construction company was signed in 2006, according to which this Chinese company will finance the renovation of the track, the rolling stock, the communication channels for the signaling, and the electrical power source. The ex-ONATRA has, in fact, opted for an aggressive commercial policy to revive the rails.

On June 30, 2018, the SCTP received two locomotives and 50 wagons from the African firm ARSS (African-Rolling Stock Solution).

In 2017, some 2.2 million tonnes of cement were produced by the two new start-up companies, PPC Barnet and Kongo Cement Factory (CIMKO). The SCTP did indeed transport part of this production to Kinshasa but the exact quantity was not communicated by the railway department of the company, the former DG Kimbembe Mazunga had communicated an agreed protocol of agreements with the cement manufacturers of Kongo-Central for the transport of their productions.

===External transport===
Kinshasa is the major [[river port]] of the Congo. The port, called 'Le Beach Ngobila' extends for about {{cvt|7|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} along the river, comprising scores of [[quay]]s and [[jetty|jetties]] with hundreds of boats and barges tied up. Ferries cross the river to [[Brazzaville]], a distance of about {{cvt|4|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. River transport also connects to dozens of ports upstream, such as [[Kisangani]] and [[Bangui]].

There are road and [[Matadi-Kinshasa Railway|rail]] links to [[Matadi]], the [[sea port]] in the Congo estuary {{cvt|150|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the Atlantic Ocean.

There are no rail links from Kinshasa further inland, and road connections to much of the rest of the country are few and in poor condition, although there has been a road built to the city of Kikwit (around 500&nbsp;km away) that has been in operation since 2015 or so. It was recently extended to the small city of Tshikapa.
