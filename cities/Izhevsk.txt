==History==
===Pioneer settlements===
[[File:Karlutka.jpg|thumb|right|Karlutka River]]
{{unsourced section|date=October 2022}}
The pioneer settlements on the territory where modern Izhevsk now stands were founded by [[Udmurt people|Udmurts]] in the 5th century. There were two fortified settlements situated on the banks of the Karlutka River. Later this territory joined the [[Khanate of Kazan]]. In 1552, Russia conquered the Khanate and, in 1582, [[Ivan the Terrible]] conferred the lands by the Karlutka and [[Izh River]]s on Bagish Yaushev, a [[Tatar]] [[morza]]. The [[quit-rent]] had been imposed on the Udmurt population ever since. The Yaushevs owned the land until the reign of [[Peter the Great]] (1682–1721).

===Ironworks construction===
On September&nbsp;15, 1757, Count [[Peter Ivanovich Shuvalov|Pyotr Shuvalov]], owner of seven factories in the [[Urals]], bought land in the [[Upper Kama Upland|Kama Region]] and got permission from [[Elizabeth of Russia|Empress Elizabeth]] to build three [[ironworks]] there. In those days, ironworks were powered with [[steam]], and wood was the only fuel. For that reason it was decided to build one of the plants on the forest-rich land near the [[Izh River]] and make iron bands and [[cast iron]] anchors. Another ironworks was built on the Votka River.

In April&nbsp;10, 1760, [[serfdom in Russia|serfs]] from neighboring villages and artisans from other Shuvalov's plants began dam construction under the direction of Alexey Moskvin, a mining engineer and a trustee of Shuvalov. This date is considered to be the date of Izhevsk's foundation.<ref name="Hist">Official website of Izhevsk. [http://www.izh.ru/en/info/14195.html History of the city] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819082642/http://www.izh.ru/en/info/14195.html |date=August 19, 2014 }}.</ref> Construction proceeded at a slow pace. The [[serf]]s were unhappy with being taken from their villages, with arduous duties and regular physical punishment, leading to tumultuous rebellions.

In 1762 Shuvalov died. His son Andrey inherited the factories. In accordance with the [[ukase]] of [[Catherine the Great]] dated November&nbsp;15, 1763, all Shuvalov's ironworks, including the one at Izhevsky Zavod, lapsed to the Crown for debts. Since that time, it has been under the authority of the [[Collegium of Mining]], an institution in charge of the Russian mining industry. The ironworks on the Izh and Votka Rivers were called Kama Plants.

In 1763 construction of the dam and ironworks was completed and the first [[bloomery iron]]{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} was smelted. As a result of the dam construction, the [[Izhevsk Reservoir]], one of the biggest in Europe was formed. Near the ironworks, the settlement was built. This settlement was named Izhevsky Zavod, meaning "the factory on the Izh" in Russian.

Initially the ironworks made palm-wide iron bands from {{convert|3-6|m}} long. These bands were supplied to [[Moscow]] for the rebuilding of the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]]. The iron from Izhevsky Zavod was also used for construction in [[Saint Petersburg]].

===Pugachev's Rebellion===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}
In October 1773, the news of the [[Pugachev's Rebellion|popular revolt]] against [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] on the [[Ural River|Yaik]] and the manifestos of [[Yemelyan Pugachev]] reached Izhevsky Zavod. The [[Cossack]] passing himself off as [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]] proclaimed liberty for [[serfs]] and called for killing nobles and factory owners. This had the backing of the serfs and artisans. So [[Colonel]] Feodor Wenzel, the manager of the Goroblagodat and Kama plants, and Aleksey Alymov, the manager of Izhevsky Zavod ironworks, were forced to escape to [[Kazan]].

On January&nbsp;1, 1774, a detachment of [[Yemelyan Pugachev]]'s rebel army reached the town. The rebels destroyed the ironworks, burned its office buildings, and wrecked the houses of the managers. They demolished the food depot and distributed the food to the people. The ironworks money was sent to the staff of the rebel army, near [[Ufa]]. The serfs were freed. Some of them joined the detachment. Iron production stopped for a while. Around this time, Catherine realized the seriousness of the rebellion and sent an army led by General [[Aleksandr Bibikov]] to crush the insurrection.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Yemelyan Pugachev {{!}} Biography & Facts {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Yemelyan-Pugachev |access-date=2022-03-18 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> In April 1774, Pugachev's army fought losing battles everywhere and was forced to leave Izhevsky Zavod. The managers returned and cowed serfs and artisans into submission, forcing them to pledge allegiance to [[Catherine the Great]]. A list of workers who had joined the rebel army was compiled for future reprisal.

In spite of opposition from the forces of Wenzel and Alymov Brothers, Pugachev's army occupied the town again on June&nbsp;27, 1774. The crowds hailed [[Yemelyan Pugachev]]. He dealt with the complaints of serfs and workers for two days. Forty-two persons, including Wenzel and the Alymovs, were executed. On June&nbsp;29, Pugachev left Izhevsky Zavod and set out for [[Kazan]]. Many workmen of Izhevsky Zavod joined his detachments and fought selflessly in the last battles of the Rebellion, which was mostly crushed by early September 1775. In spite of the defeat of the rebel army and the execution of its leader, bands of rebels continued to fight. New managers of the ironworks suppressed serfs and brought back artisans by force, cracking down on the bands of rebels.

The ironworks was restored and began to function by the end of 1775. The former order was reinstated. The forced laborers weren't interested in boosting productivity and the practice fell into decay by the 19th century.

===Arms factory foundation===
{{unsourced section|date=October 2022}}
In 1800, Emperor [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] ordered an arms factory built in the Urals in view of a mounting threat from [[Napoleonic France]]. Andrew Deryabin, a mining engineer, chief of Goroblagodat, Perm, Kama and Bogoslov plants, chose the site for the new plant. He saw <!-- I bet this should he "looked at" or "considered" --> several places in the [[Perm Governorate|Perm]] and [[Vyatka Governorate|Vyatka]] governorates and concluded that the most suitable place for plant foundation was Izh Zavod. It occurred to him to turn the ironworks into the armory.

[[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] approved of Deryabin's project and construction began on the arms factory building on June&nbsp;10, 1807, considered the year of Izhevsk's second birth.

===Dudin's plan===
{{unsourced section|date=October 2022}}
The new factory had a shortage of manpower. Staff vacancies were filled by serfs, workmen from Urals mining plants and recruits. Armorers were transferred from other arms factories and hired from [[Europe]], mainly from Denmark and Sweden.

The population of the settlement grew quickly so that by the end of 1808 there were more than 6,000 inhabitants. Because of housing requirements, people had to build their houses after work, at night. Houses were made from wood found in forests near the factory. At the same time, workers built new barracks for the soldiers and housing for factory employees, officers and officials, the hospital, schools and other social facilities.

The settlement was built according to the master plan. Architect Feodor Dudin was an author of this plan and a director of all construction works. The principle of an urban grid was the basis of the new master plan. Wide and straight streets crossed side streets running perpendicular to them. Their accurate network formed small rectangular blocks.

On May&nbsp;18, 1810, a major fire burned in Izhevsky Zavod. 174 houses, the warehouse, and two wooden churches were destroyed.

After the fire, implementation of Dudin's plan began. The houses were made of pinewood logs. As a rule, a house consisted of two ''[[izba]]s'', joined with an inner porch. Houses of the poor consisted of one ''izba''. Armorers and officials erected two-storied and five-wall log houses. There were 15 streets in Izh by the 1820s. In 1812, Izhevsky Zavod was divided into three administrative parts because of growth in population and territory. In 1816, there were 1,710 houses, 8 factory stone buildings, a prison, a cemetery, a stone church and a school in the settlement. The population was 8,324.

In the 1820s, 1830s, and 1840s, a number of large stone building was erected. St. [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral (Izhevsk)|Alexander Nevsky Cathedral]] was built between 1818 and 1823, and visited by Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander]] (who considered Alexander Nevsky his patron saint) shortly after its completion. Other noteworthy large stone buildings which still remain from that era include the Arsenal (1823–25), Public Offices (1843–45) and house of contractor Egor Novikov. All improved Izhevsk's appearance.

By 1850, the settlement had more than doubled, to population of 19,163. Its territory was about 6200 square miles. 3499 buildings were wooden, and 27 others, including three churches, were made of stone. The settlement had 1066 wells.

===Izhevsky Zavod after the Emancipation Reform of 1861===
{{unsourced section|date=October 2022}}
On February&nbsp;19, 1861, Emperor of Russia [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] carried out the [[Emancipation reform of 1861|Emancipation Reform]]. On October&nbsp;9, 1865, [[Collegium of Mining|Berg-kollegia]], apprehending a prospective cost increase, leased the arms factory to a partnership of industrialists.

In 1866, serfs of the factory obtained their liberty with the 1861 Emancipation Manifesto and gained self-government. Izhevsky Zavod was divided into two [[volost]]s: Nagornaya Volost and Zarechnaya Volost, or Zareka. Each [[volost]] had its board of administration and consisted of rural groups. Rural circles were headed by a ''[[starosta]]'', selected in the gathering. There were seven rural societies in Nagornaya Volost; Zarechnaya Volost consisted of four.

Administrations of [[volost]]s reported to the Board of [[Sarapul]] [[Zemstvo]]. They were led by volost ''starshinas'', elected for three years. Volost administrations were in charge of doing duty and paying taxes. They issued passports, managed improvement of territory{{clarify|date=February 2018}} and other local affairs.

Administrative and police oversight was carried out by the factory administration. Besides the administration delivered documents of title to land and house. The ponds, pastures and hayfields were turned over to the [[armorer]]s and [[artisans]].

The abolition of serfdom aggravated wealth inequalities between the inhabitants of Izhevsky Zavod. Well-to-do sections of population included the factory management, skilled armorers and artisans, administrative professionals, officials, clergy and merchants. Such stratification had an influence on view of the settlement. Working people were driven out of Nagornaya Part and settled in [[bog]]gy Zareka. At that time, [[Koltoma]], another working-class locality, grew. In the early 1870s, there were about twenty private stone buildings in Izhevsky Zavod. In Zarechnaya Part all houses were made of wood.

Civic life depended on government contract work. In the years of war or army re-equipment, the orders grew, and so did the workforce and labour earnings. After the government orders were filled and wages were cut, most workmen left the arms factory and the settlement fell into decay until the next government contract.

===Enterprises in Izhevsky Zavod===
{{unsourced section|date=October 2022}}
In 1872, the steel works was founded in Izhevsky Zavod. In 1884, the arms factory and the steel works passed to the state.

Private armories appeared in Izhevsky Zavod.

*In 1860, an armorer named Ivan Fyodorovich Petrov began making hunting rifles at a small armory in [[Zaręka]]. Later, he set up shop in [[Yekaterinburg]], [[Omsk]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]] and the [[Caucasus]]. He and his sons also sold gunpowder in Izhevsky Zavod. One of his sons, Vasily, later opened his own armory.
*Andrian Nikandrovich Evdokimov was a competitor of the Petrovs. He had the armory on Bazarnaya Street.
*Nikolay Ilyich Berezin built his enterprise on Bazarnaya Street, too. He produced guns. He also owned a small iron foundry in the northeast suburbs.
*Merchants Porsev and Kilin were the owners of two brick factories.

There were twelve private industrial enterprises in Izhevsky Zavod by 1914.

===Izhevsky Zavod merchants===
{{unsourced section|date=October 2022}}
In the 1870s, trade blossomed in Izhevsky Zavod. The Bodalev Brothers, Mokletsov, Ogloblin, Sveshnikov and Sozykin were the most successful merchants. It was profitable to deal in spirits. There were three vodka distilleries, four wine warehouses, three wine cellars, and about fifty taverns in 1872. This year Ivan Bodalev opened his brewery on the bank of the reservoir.

===Religious buildings===
At the turn of the 19th century, there were four temples in Izhevsky Zavod. [[St. Michael's Cathedral (Izhevsk)|St. Michael's Cathedral]] was built between 1897 and 1915.

Izhevsky Zavod was one of the residence centers of the [[History of Jews in Udmurtia and Tatarstan|Udmurt Jews]], who spoke ''Udmurtish'' ''Yiddish''.<ref name="snioo.ru">Altyntsev A.V., "The Concept of Love in Ashkenazim of Udmurtia and Tatarstan", Nauka Udmurtii. 2013. № 4 (66), p. 131.

===The Russian Revolution and the Russian Civil War===
{{unsourced section|date=October 2022}}
On March&nbsp;5, 1917, workers at the plant formed a [[soviet (council)|worker's soviet]], which included representatives of the workers, the army and of other citizens. Two days later the factory administration resigned. By mid-September of the same year, [[Bolshevik]]s took control of both the council and its influential newspaper. On October&nbsp;27, 1917, Soviet government was officially announced, with the council officially dissolved soon thereafter. 

The former leaders of the council were arrested in June 1918, contributing to [[Izhevsk-Votkinsk Uprising|an uprising against Bolshevik rule]]. The struggle for control of the city continued until the arrival of the [[Red Army]], which took Izhevsk on November&nbsp;7. On April&nbsp;13, 1919, the city was occupied by units of [[Aleksandr Kolchak|Admiral Kolchak]]'s [[White movement|White Army]], only to fall again, this time decisively, to another assault by the Red Army in June&nbsp;8 of the same year.

===The Soviet period===
[[File:Izhevsk1918.jpg|thumb|left|Bazarnaya Street and Saint Michael's Cathedral in 1918]]

The Soviet period saw significant growth in the size and importance of Izhevsk. In 1921, the city became the [[administrative center]] of [[Votsk Autonomous Oblast]], a precursor to the [[Udmurtia|Udmurt Republic]]. On December 28, 1934, Izhevsk received status of capital of the [[Udmurt Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]. The first [[Izhevsk tramway|tramline]] was opened in 1935. It was 5&nbsp;km long.

On March&nbsp;14, 1937, the Republic's constitution was adopted. It consolidated the capital status of Izhevsk. In the autumn of 1941 several defense-related plants evacuated to Izhevsk. In June, 1943, [[Izhevsk Mechanical Plant]] was founded. During World War II, Izhevsk plants produced 12 and a half million small arms.
<!-- no idea why this is here but the rest if this is so stilted it could easily be a comical mistranslation of something important: New City Circus was opened on November 29, 1943.-->

[[World War II]] had a profound effect on the city; much of the industrial infrastructure evacuated from the western regions of the Soviet Union was relocated to the city. Elements of the evacuated enterprises were used to create the [[Izhevsk Mechanical Plant]], which remains an important manufacturer of military components.

[[File:UdSU 1.jpg|thumb|Izhevsk in 2016]]
Military industry remained the core of the local economy after the war, so Izhvesk was designated a [[closed city]], inaccessible to foreigners. The city's [[Izhmash]] factory began manufacturing the [[AK-47]] automatic rifle in 1948, and continues to produce modern variants of the design to this day. The rifle's designer, [[Mikhail Kalashnikov]] lived in Izhevsk until his death in 2013. In 1966, Izhmash began manufacturing the [[Izhmash|Izh]] brand of automobiles.

In 1984, the city was renamed '''Ustinov'''; in honor of former minister of defense [[Dmitry Ustinov]].<ref name="Ustinov" /> Three years later, despite vocal protests by a significant number of citizens, Izhevsk regained its historical name.<ref name="Ustinov" />

Izhevsk weathered the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|post-Soviet]] years reasonably well, carried through by the continued demand for its military products. The city remains an important industrial and military center of the country, referred to as the "Armory of Russia", a title it shares with the city of [[Tula, Russia|Tula]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Importing Russia's Top Gun|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/15/business/a-kalashnikov-factory-in-russia-survives-on-sales-to-us-gun-owners.html?_r=1&src=rechp|quote=The nickname of this town, home of the factory that makes Kalashnikov rifles, is the 'Armory of Russia'...|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=August 14, 2012|access-date=2012-08-16|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506234113/https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/15/business/a-kalashnikov-factory-in-russia-survives-on-sales-to-us-gun-owners.html?_r=1&src=rechp|archive-date=May 6, 2018|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Izhevsk was one of the homes of the [[History of Jews in Udmurtia and Tatarstan|Udmurt Jews]].<ref name="snioo.ru"/> Jews have lived in Izhevsk since the 1830s.<ref name="lechaim.ru"/><ref name="migdal.org.ua"/><ref name="invozho.ru"/>

==Economy==
Izhevsk is the most important economic center of the Udmurt Republic, with the majority of financial and industrial activity concentrated in the city. Military industry remains the backbone of the local economy, with a number of enterprises operating in the city. By far the most important of these is [[Izhmash]], which produces small arms and assault rifles popular both in Russia and abroad. The plant also produces motorcycles and automobiles under IZH brandname.

In 2006, Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez]] visited Izhevsk to tour the [[Izhmash]] manufacturing center where he announced his government's intention to purchase a large number of Izhevsk-produced rifles.

==Climate==
Izhevsk has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with long, cold winters and short, warm summers. Summers are quite a bit warmer than at corresponding latitudes in [[Western Europe]], courtesy of the city's far inland location. Winters are a lot colder than said areas, also due to the distance from the [[North Atlantic]], which results in limited temperature moderation. Even so, winters are a lot less severe than those in Russian cities east of the [[Ural Mountains]].

An extreme July temperature of {{convert|+37.0|C|F}} was recorded during the [[2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat waves]], although the highest temperature recorded is {{convert|+38.1|C|F}} in August 2021.<ref name="Pogoda i Klimat"/>

==Life and culture==
===Education===
{{unsourced section|date=September 2022}}
Izhevsk is the scientific and cultural center of the Udmurt Republic. Early on, the state took a leading role in childcare and education. 320 Public kindergartens/ preschools provide affordable childcare for 32,000 children. 100 public schools provide free general education to over 100,000 Izhevsk students. A wide variety of technical colleges and two-year professional schools award associate degrees, most notably in medical assistance, performing arts and teaching.

The Ural department of the Russian Scientific Academy is represented in Izhevsk by several institutions, specializing in physics, applied mechanics and technical sciences, and economics, and the Institute of History, Language and Literature of Udmurtia does the same.

Four out of five higher education institutes in the Udmurt Republic are located in Izhevsk: [[Udmurt State University]], Izhevsk State Technical University, Agricultural Academy, and [[:ru:Ижевская государственная медицинская академия|Izhevsk State Medical Academy]]. Each of these educational institutions admits foreign students.

Udmurt State University celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2006. It is the oldest educational institution in the Udmurt Republic. Some 28,000 students are currently studying at the university, which offers 86 different majors. The university has thirteen departments and seven institutes. Out of 1,000 faculty members 130 hold Doctor of Science (Dr.Sc.) degrees, and 460 are Candidates of Sciences (Cand.Sc., equivalent to first year of Ph.D.). UdSU graduate school offers 11 attestation committees qualified to award Cand.Sc. and Dr.Sc. degrees in ecology, economics, law, psychology, pedagogics, ethnology, history, culture, linguistics of the Ural region, and Udmurt linguistics.

Izhevsk is a pilot city of the [[Council of Europe]] and [[European Commission]] '''[[Intercultural cities]]''' programme.

===Museums and galleries===
{{unsourced section|date=September 2022}}
There are about fifty museums and galleries in Izhevsk. The most popular of them are:
*The Kalashnikov Museum and Exhibition Complex of Small Arms;
*The Gerd National Museum — the Arsenal;
*The Udmurt Republican Museum of Fine Arts;
*The Izhmash Museum;
*The Museum of Medicine and Pharmacy;
*The Museum of Electrification and Electroenergetics;
*The Gennadiy Krasilnikov Memorial Flat;
*The National Center of Decorative and Applied Arts and Handicraft;
*The Galerea Exhibition Center.

The Kalashnikov Museum and Exhibition Complex of Small Arms, or the Kalashnikov Museum, opened in 2004. Its expositions tell about Izhevsk as one of the most important centers of Russian arms production. The main person of the museum narration is [[Mikhail Kalashnikov]]. The museum and exhibition complex holds the permanent exposition devoted to this legendary Russian armourer. There are temporary expositions in addition to the permanent exposition launched in 2004. The Museum has a demonstration hall, including the shooting gallery where different models of historical and contemporary arms are presented, and the pneumatic shooting gallery.

17 kilometers from Izhevsk is the Ludorvay Architectural and Ethnographic Open-air Museum. It was founded in 1990 on the premises of the former Russian settlement Ilyinka. Total area of the culture preserve is about 40 hectares. It divided into five exhibition parts: the Sector of Central Udmurts, the Sector of Southern Udmurts, Russian sector, the Windmill, and the Mushtor Apiary Complex.

===Circus===
{{unsourced section|date=September 2022}}
One of the integral parts of Izhevsk cultural life is the State Circus of the Udmurt Republic. Residents of Izhevsk have liked circus throughout the history of the city. In olden days the settlement was visited by vagrant performers — skomorokhs with mountain bears, strongmen and fakirs. Since the turn of the 19th century, shows took places in booths — temporary structures with benches for the rich and standing room for the poor.

The first Izhevsk circus was built by Aleksandr Koromyslov in 1895. It had existed until the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] began.
On 21 September 1926, the Kolart Circus was opened. It was made of wood and seated 1,500 spectators.

In 1943, at the height of The [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]], the stone circus building was erected in the Kolart's place. It was designed by P.M. Popov after the pattern of [[Ciniselli Circus]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. On 29 November 1943, wounded soldiers saw the first show there. The Circus seated 1,800 spectators and was considered one of the best in the Soviet Union.

On January&nbsp;14, 1990, the Circus was closed because of dilapidation. On 29 December 1999, the building was razed.

On January&nbsp;17, 2000, a cornerstone of new circus was laid. The project was designed by Moscow architect Mikhail Vesnin. In the judgment of specialists, the contemporary building of the Circus is one of the best in Russia. It seats 1,800 spectators like the predecessor and has current technologies and high-performance audio and light equipment.

The International Circus Art Festival has been held at the State Circus of the Udmurt Republic yearly in March since 2008. Circus stars come to Izhevsk from every corner of the globe. Some of the world's leading circus art festivals and circus managers and producers join the festival jury.

===Pond===
{{Main|Izhevsk Reservoir}}

[[Izhevsk Pond|Izhvesk City Pond]]'s area is over 22&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, yet it was artificially constructed (in parts dug by hand) in the 1760s for industrial needs. Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia]] granted Count [[Peter Ivanovich Shuvalov|Peter Shuvalov]] official permission to create three factories in the [[Kama River]] region September 15, 1757.
[[File:Udmurtia State Circus, Izhevsk, Russia.jpg|thumb|Udmurtia Republic Circus]]

Construction of the three-step industrial dam at the critical point where the two rivers (Izh and Yagul/Podborenka) join started both the pond and the city in April 1760.

The dam was reconstructed in 1809–1815 when [[Andrey Fedorovich Deryabin]] converted the original metalworking factory into the new arms producing facility. It was subsequently modernized again in 1983–1984 in order to extend the dam. Today a number of major Izhevsk industrial plants are still located along the pond.

In 1972, the Izhevsk Pond Embankment, a three-mile-long walkway and a system of boulevards and squares, was extended along the pond. The "Friendship of Nations" Square, with its central monument celebrating 400 years of Udmurtia's union with Russia, is a focal point of the esplanade and a hip place for youth recreation. During the summer months excursion boats operate from Izhevsk to the village of Volozhka.
