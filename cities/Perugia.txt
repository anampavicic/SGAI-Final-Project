The city is located about {{convert|164|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Rome]] and {{convert|148|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Florence]]. It covers a high hilltop and part of the valleys around the area.

The history of Perugia goes back to the Etruscan period; Perugia was one of the main [[Etruscan cities]].

The city is also known as a [[university]] town, with the [[University of Perugia]] founded in 1308, the [[University for Foreigners Perugia|University for Foreigners]], and some smaller colleges such as the Academy of Fine Arts "Pietro Vannucci" ({{langx|it|Accademia di Belle Arti "Pietro Vannucci"}}) public athenaeum founded in 1573, the Perugia University Institute of Linguistic Mediation for translators and interpreters, the Music Conservatory of Perugia, founded in 1788, and other institutes.

Perugia is also a well-known cultural and artistic centre of Italy. The city hosts multiple annual festivals and events, e.g., former [[Eurochocolate]] Festival (October), now in [[Bastia Umbra]], the [[Umbria Jazz Festival]] (July), and the [[International Journalism Festival]] (in April), and is associated with multiple notable people in the arts.

Painter Pietro Vannucci, nicknamed [[Perugino]], was a native of [[Città della Pieve]], near Perugia. He decorated the local ''Sala del Cambio'' with a series of [[fresco]]es; eight of his pictures can also be seen in the National Gallery of Umbria.<ref>cf. ''Perugia'', Raffaele Rossi, Pietro Scarpellini, 1993 (Vol. 1, pg. 337, 344)</ref>

Perugino was the teacher of [[Raphael]],<ref>"...it appears most probable that he did not enter Perugino's studio till the end of 1499, as during the four or five years before that Perugino was mostly absent from his native city. The so-called Sketch Book of Raphael in the academy of Venice contains studies apparently from the cartoons of some of Perugino's Sistine frescoes, possibly done as practice in drawing."

The independent works depicted in Perugia are: the ''Ansidei Madonna ''(taken by the French under the terms of the Treaty of Tolentino in 1798), the Deposition by Raphael (''Pala Baglioni'', this masterpiece was expropriated by Scipione Borghese in 1608, cf. [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,11711,1330380,00.html 'The Guardian'', October 19, 2004]), the Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints, by [[Raphael]] (formerly located in the convent of St Anthony of Padua cf.[http://arthistory.about.com/od/special_exhibitions/l/bl_raphael_colonna_rev.htm The Colonna Altarpiece review at Art History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219111241/http://arthistory.about.com/od/special_exhibitions/l/bl_raphael_colonna_rev.htm |date=2007-12-19 }}), the ''Connestabile Madonna'' (this picture left Perugia in 1871, when Count Connestabile sold it to the emperor of [[Russia]] for £13,200, cf. ''Encyclopædia Britannica''), the Oddi altar by Raphael (requisitioned by the French in 1798)</ref> and one fresco.<ref name = "severo"/> Another painter, [[Pinturicchio]], lived in Perugia.

The city's symbol is the [[griffin]], which can be seen in the form of [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]]s and [[statue]]s on buildings around the city. It is also the symbol of the local football club [[A.C. Perugia]], who have previously played in the [[Serie A]]. Having never been Italian champions, the club went unbeaten in the [[1978–79 Serie A|1978–79]] season in spite of finishing second in the championship.

== History ==
{{For timeline}}

=== Umbrians and Etruscans ===
Perugia was an [[Umbri]]an settlement<ref name="Britannica">Perugia (2007). In ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved May 21, 2007, from [https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9059376 Encyclopædia Britannica Online]</ref> but first appears in written history as ''[[Perusia]]'', one of the 12 [[Etruscan civilization#Etruscan League|confederate]] cities of [[Etruria]];<ref name="Britannica"/> it was first mentioned in [[Quintus Fabius Pictor|Q. Fabius Pictor's]] account, used by [[Livy]], of the expedition carried out against the [[Etruscan civilization#Etruscan League|Etruscan League]] by [[Fabius Maximus Rullianus]]<ref>"How much of his glory is due to his kinsman, Fabius Pictor, the first historian of Rome, or to the family legends, which found in Etruria the most fitting scene for the exploits of the [[Fabius|great Fabian house]], we cannot tell" (Walter W. How and Henry Devenish Leigh, ''A History of Rome to the Death of Caesar'' London: Longmans, Green 1898:112).</ref> in 310 or 309 BC. At that time a thirty-year ''[[Truce|indutiae]]'' (truce) was agreed upon;<ref>Livy ix.37.12).</ref> however, in 295 Perusia took part in the [[Samnite Wars|Third Samnite War]] and was forced, with Volsinii and Arretium ([[Arezzo]]), to sue for peace in the following year.<ref>Livy ix.30.1–2, 31.1–3; ''indutiae'' with [[Volsinii]], Perusia and Arretium, ix.37.4–5.</ref>

=== Roman period ===
In 216 and 205 BC, it assisted Rome in the [[Second Punic War]], but afterwards it is not mentioned until 41–40 BC, when [[Lucius Antonius (brother of Mark Antony)|Lucius Antonius]] took refuge there, and was defeated by [[Augustus|Octavian]] after a long siege, and its senators sent to their deaths. A number of [[Sling_(weapon)#Ammunition|lead bullets used by slingers]] have been found in and around the city.<ref>cf. ''Corpus Inscr. Lat.'' xi. 1212</ref> The city was burnt, we are told, with the exception of the temples of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]—the massive Etruscan terrace-walls,<ref>[http://www.perugiaonline.com/perugia_arcoetrusco.html Etruscan town walls].</ref> naturally, can hardly have suffered at all—and the town, with the territory for a mile round, was allowed to be occupied by whoever chose. It must have been rebuilt almost at once, for several bases for statues exist, inscribed ''Augusto sacr(um) Perusia restituta''; but it did not become a ''[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'', until 251–253 AD, when it was resettled as ''Colonia Vibia Augusta Perusia'', under the emperor [[Trebonianus Gallus]].<ref>Latin inscriptions at two of the preserved Etruscan gates.</ref>

=== Early Middle Ages ===
It is hardly mentioned except by the geographers until it was the only city in Umbria to resist [[Totila]] and the [[Ostrogoths]], who captured it and laid the city waste in 547, after a long siege, apparently after the city's Byzantine garrison evacuated. Negotiations with the besieging forces fell to the city's bishop, [[Herculanus of Perugia|Herculanus]], as representative of the townspeople.<ref>Patrick Amory, ''People and Identity in Ostrogothic Italy, 489–554'' pp185-86, referring to Perugia in passing, notes the increasingly localized role assumed since the mid-fifth century by the bishops.</ref> Totila is said to have ordered the bishop to be [[flayed]] and beheaded. St. Herculanus (Sant'Ercolano) later became the city's [[patron saint]].<ref>Procopius, ''Bellum Gothicum'', 3 (7).2.35.2, characteristically does not mention the incident, reported in [[Gregory the Great]], [http://www.ccel.org/p/pearse/morefathers/gregory_03_dialogues_book3.htm#C13 ''Dialogues'', 13] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917040820/http://www.ccel.org/p/pearse/morefathers/gregory_03_dialogues_book3.htm#C13 |date=2009-09-17 }}, who imagines a seven-year siege (i.e. since 540, before the accession of [[Totila|Baduila]]) and dramatically reports Herculanus' grotesque murder.</ref>

=== Middle Ages ===
In the [[Lombards|Lombard]] period, Perugia is spoken of as one of the principal cities of [[Tuscia]].<ref>[[Procopius of Caesarea]], ''Gothic Wars'' I,16 and III,35.</ref> In the 9th century, with the consent of [[Charlemagne]] and [[Louis the Pious]], it passed under the popes; but by the 11th century, its [[Medieval commune|commune]] was asserting itself, and for many centuries the city continued to maintain an independent life, warring against many of the neighbouring lands and cities— [[Foligno]], [[Assisi]], [[Spoleto]], [[Todi]], [[Siena]], [[Arezzo]], etc. In 1186, [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], ''rex romanorum'' and future emperor, granted diplomatic recognition to the [[consul]]ar government of the city; afterward, [[Pope Innocent III]], whose major aim was to give state dignity to the dominions having been constituting the [[Patrimonium Sancti Petri|patrimony of St. Peter]], acknowledged the validity of the imperial statement and recognised the established civic practices as having the force of law.<ref name="commune">cf. ''Perugia'', Raffaele Rossi, Attilio Bartoli Angeli, Roberta Sottani 1993 (Vol. 1, pp. 120–140)</ref>[[File:01 Perugia Grifo Codice Medioevo.jpg|thumb|Perugia [[griffin]], in a medieval [[Latin]] [[document]]]]On various occasions, the popes found asylum from the tumults of Rome within its walls, and it was the meetingplace of five [[Papal conclave|conclaves]] ([[Perugia Papacy]]), including those that elected [[Pope Honorius III|Honorius III]] (1216), [[Pope Clement IV|Clement IV]] (1265), [[Pope Celestine V|Celestine V]] (1294), and [[Pope Clement V|Clement V]] (1305); the papal presence was characterised by a pacificatory rule between the internal rivalries.<ref name="commune" /> But Perugia had no mind simply to subserve the papal interests and never accepted papal sovereignty; the city used to exercise a jurisdiction over the members of the clergy, moreover in 1282, Perugia was excommunicated due to a new military offensive against the Ghibellines regardless of a papal prohibition. On the other hand, side by side with the 13th-century bronze griffin of Perugia above the door of the [[Palazzo dei Priori]] stands, as a Guelphic emblem, the [[lion (heraldry)|lion]], and Perugia remained loyal for the most part to the Guelph party in the struggles of [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]], but this dominant tendency was rather an anti-Germanic and Italian political strategy.<ref name="commune" /> The [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] presence in Italy appeared to offer a counterpoise to papal powers; in 1319, Perugia declared the Angevin Saint [[Louis of Toulouse]] "Protector of the city's sovereignty and of the Palazzo of its Priors"<ref>"Avvocato della Signoria cittadina e del Palazzo dei suoi Priori"</ref> and set his figure among the other patron saints above the rich doorway of the Palazzo dei Priori. Midway through the 14th century [[Bartholus of Sassoferrato]], who was a renowned jurist, asserted that Perugia was dependent upon neither imperial nor papal support.<ref name="commune" /> In 1347, at the time of [[Cola di Rienzi|Rienzi's]] unfortunate enterprise in reviving the Roman republic, Perugia sent 10 ambassadors to pay him honour, and when papal legates sought to coerce it by foreign soldiers, or to exact contributions, they met with vigorous resistance, which broke into open warfare with [[Pope Urban V]] in 1369; in 1370, the noble party reached an agreement signing the treaty of [[Bologna]], and Perugia was forced to accept a papal legate; however. the vicar-general of the Papal States, [[Gérard du Puy]], Abbot of Marmoutier and nephew of [[Pope Gregory IX|Gregory IX]],<ref>Made a cardinal by his uncle, 20 December 1375 ([http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/consistories-xiv.htm Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church: 14th century])</ref> was expelled by a popular uprising in 1375, and his fortification of Porta Sole was razed to the ground.<ref name="touring" />

==== The lordships of Perugia ====
[[File:Biordo Michelotti2022.jpg|thumb|278x278px|[[Biordo Michelotti]], Lord of Perugia from 1393 to 1398]]

===== [[Biordo Michelotti]] (1393–1398) =====
On August 5, 1393, the condottiero (mercenary captain) Biordo Michelotti, a member of the popular faction known as the Raspanti, made his triumphant entry into Perugia, and the general council appointed him as the "knight of the people" of Perugia and the "general captain" of the militias. A special commission of twenty-five citizens was tasked with banishing one hundred and fifty noblemen, while Biordo decided the return of noble individuals who were not considered guilty of sedition. Among the exiled noblemen was Braccio da Montone, one of the most skilled military leaders of the time, who vowed not to seek "any pact or agreement with the Raspanti of Perugia."

It was precisely against the exiled nobles, especially Braccio da Montone, the soul and leader of the noble movement in exile, that the government of the Raspanti directed its efforts after the turmoil of 1393. Holding virtually all power, Biordo was recognized as the first "lord of Perugia," even though during his short rule (1393–1398), he left intact the priory and all existing communal institutions, focusing solely on extending his dominion beyond Perugia. After the splendid marriage with Giovanna Orsini, Biordo and his bride took residence in the Porta Sole palace, but on March 10, 1398, Biordo fell victim to a conspiracy orchestrated by Francesco Guidalotti, abbot of San Pietro. In their new residence, Michelotti was stabbed by Giovanni and Annibaldo, brothers of the abbot of San Pietro.
[[File:GiovAmbrogiodePredisattribGianGaleazzoVisconti.jpg|left|thumb|171x171px|[[Gian Galeazzo Visconti]], Lord of Perugia from 1400 to 1402]]

===== [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti]] (1400–1402) =====
The death of Michelotti removed an important point of reference, and factions threatened the stability within and outside the walls. Meanwhile, the twenty-five worked diligently to find an institution that could protect the city and alleviate a very high debt. The people's demands for independence were no longer as urgent, and in the 15th century, the common belief was that they had to accept a ruler or master capable of providing the minimum requirements for survival. The choice fell on the Duchy of Milan, and on January 21, 1400, Gian Galeazzo Visconti was proclaimed the lord of Perugia by the voluntary submission of the city. In response to the delegation of the ten representatives that Perugia had sent him, he canceled the debt of the Perugians. His lordship was short-lived, and on October 3, 1402, Visconti passed away.
[[File:Braccio da Montone-Palazzo dei Priori.jpg|thumb|245x245px|[[Braccio da Montone]]]]

==== [[Braccio da Montone]] (1416–1424) ====
In 1408, Ladislao D'Angiò Durazzo, the King of Naples, successfully captured Perugia and intended to have it administered by [[Braccio da Montone|Braccio Fortebracci]]. However, Braccio vehemently opposed this idea and declined the offer. Nonetheless, in 1411, Perugia surrendered to the King of Naples, opting to be ruled by a foreigner rather than a nobleman. Braccio viewed this as a profound betrayal by his fellow citizens and fled. In November 1410, Braccio besieged Perugia but failed to capture it due to the city's resistance. He defeated pursuing troops and terrorized surrounding towns. In April 1416, he returned with a large army and attacked Perugia. After a victory in July, Perugia surrendered, marking the end of the Raspanti government. Braccio ruled moderately. In 1417, he entered Rome and proclaimed himself Defender of the City, later returning to Umbria. After conflicts and military successes, he was appointed Vicar by the Pope. Upon returning to Perugia, he undertook public works. He left for Bologna, returned, and went to Calabria. When denied entry to L'Aquila, he laid siege but faced opposition from the Pope and Queen. A league attacked him near Pescara in 1424, leading to his death. His son later buried him in Perugia with honors. During the rule of Braccio Fortebracci da Montone, significant public works were undertaken, such as Braccio's residence in the square, of which only the loggias remain, or the "Sopramuro," to which Braccio had another series of supporting structures built: the "briglie di Braccio."

=== The Renaissance ===
[[File:Braccio Baglioni, Gonfalone di Benedetto Bonfigli.jpg|thumb|269x269px|Braccio Baglioni, Lord of Perugia from 1438 to 1479.]]

==== [[Baglioni family]] (1438–1540) ====
[[File:Perugia-Towers Benedetto-Bonfigli.jpg|left|thumb|Perugia in 1454]]
During the period 1438–1479, the Baglioni family held a covert lordship over Perugia, which was not characterized by complete control of civic powers. Braccio I Baglioni, leveraging his position as captain of the militias of the Holy See and being the nephew of Braccio da Montone, the previous Lord of the City, exerted an influence over Perugia that quickly established its supremacy. During those years, the Umbrian center experienced a period of flourishing growth as the Baglioni implemented a policy of expansion and beautification of the city, including the construction of new roads and palaces.[[File:Pietro Perugino cat52a-1.jpg|left|thumb|212x212px|[[Pietro Perugino]], ''self-portrait'']]Between 1429 and 1433, the Palazzo dei Priori was expanded, new churches and private chapels were built, and the patronage of the Baglioni attracted artists such as Piero della Francesca, Pinturicchio, and Raphael, making Perugia an important artistic center. During this time, Perugia became a significant hub of the Umbrian Renaissance, marked by the production of the eight panels depicting the life of Saint Bernardino, a collaborative effort involving Pinturicchio, Piermatteo d'Amelia, and the young Perugino, among others, commonly referred to as the "1473 workshop." The Perugino Pietro Vannucci created numerous works in the city, including a cycle of frescoes in the Hall of Audiences of the Collegio del Cambio.

Additionally, the Baglioni family commissioned the construction of an imposing aristocratic palace as their private residence, of which only the part incorporated into the Rocca Paolina remains today. The palace was decorated by Domenico Veneziano with a painting cycle depicting noble Perugian families and great military leaders of the past.
[[File:Giuseppe-rossi rocca-paolina.jpg|thumb|[[Rocca Paolina]], view of the fortress in a 19th century painting]]
Following mutual atrocities of the Oddi and the Baglioni families, power was at last concentrated in the Baglioni, who though they had no legal position, defied all other authority, though their bloody internal squabbles culminated in a massacre, 14 July 1500.<ref name="touring" /> [[Gian Paolo Baglioni]] was lured to Rome in 1520 and beheaded by [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]]; and in 1540, Rodolfo, who had slain a papal legate, was defeated by [[Pier Luigi Farnese]], and the city, captured and plundered by his soldiery, was deprived of its privileges. A citadel known as the [[Rocca Paolina]], after the name of [[Pope Paul III]], was built, to designs of [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]] "''ad coercendam Perusinorum audaciam''."<ref> "to bring to heel the audacious Perugini".</ref>

[[File:Rocca Paolina.jpg|thumb|upright|left|In the [[Rocca Paolina]]]]
In 1797, the city was conquered by French troops. On 4 February 1798, the ''Tiberina Republic'' was formed, with Perugia as capital, and the French [[Flag of France|tricolour]] as flag. In 1799, the Tiberina Republic merged to the [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]].

In 1832, 1838, and 1854, Perugia was hit by earthquakes. Following the collapse of the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman republic of 1848–49]], when the Rocca was in part demolished,<ref name="touring">cf. Touring Club Italiano, ''Guida d'Italia: Umbria'' (1966)</ref> it was seized in May 1849 by the [[Austria]]ns. In June 1859, the inhabitants rebelled against the temporal authority of the pope and established a provisional government, but [[1859 Perugia uprising|the insurrection]] was quashed bloodily by [[Pope Pius IX|Pius IX's]] troops.<ref>cf.

== Geography ==
Perugia is the capital city of the region of Umbria. Cities' distances from Perugia: Assisi {{convert|19|km|mi|abbr=on}}, Siena {{convert|102|km|0|abbr=on}}, Florence {{convert|145|km|0|abbr=on}}, Rome {{convert|164|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

=== Climate ===
Though Perugia is located in the central part of Italy, the city experiences a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa'') similar to much of Northern Italy due to its inland location and the diverse, hilly topography of Umbria. Typically, summers are warm to hot and humid, while winters are cold with occasional snowfall. The climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, with adequate rainfall year-round.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=8161&cityname=Perugia,+Umbria,+Italy&units=|title=Perugia, Italy Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=May 10, 2020}}</ref>

An electric tramway operated in Perugia from 1901 until 1940. It was decommissioned in favour of buses, and since 1943 trolley buses – the latter were in service until 1975.

Two elevators were established since 1971:
* Mercato Coperto (Parking) – Terrazza Mercato Coperto
* Galleria Kennedy – Mercato Coperto (Pincetto)

This was followed by public escalators:
* Rocca Paolina: Piazza Partigiani – Piazza Italia (1983)
* Cupa-Pellini: Piazzale della Cupa – Via dei Priori (1989)
* Piazzale Europa – Piazzale Bellucci (1993)
* Piazzale Bellucci – Corso Cavour (1993)
* Minimetrò: Pincetto – Piazza Matteotti (2008)

Since 1971 Perugia has taken several measures against car traffic, when the first traffic restriction zone was implemented. These zones were expanded over time and at certain hours of the day driving is forbidden in the city centre. Large parking lots are provided in the lower town, from where the city can be reached via public transport.

Since 2008, an [[automated people mover]] called [[Minimetrò]] has also been in operation. It has seven stations, with one terminal at a large parking lot, and the other in the city centre.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.urbanrail.net/eu/per/perugia.htm |title=Perugia MiniMetro on |publisher=Urbanrail.net |date=2008-01-29 |access-date=2010-04-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409022959/http://www.urbanrail.net/eu/per/perugia.htm |archive-date=2010-04-09 }}</ref>
