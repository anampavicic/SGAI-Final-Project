'''Coimbatore''' (Tamil: kōyamputtūr, {{IPA-ta|koːjɐmbut̪ːuːɾ|IPA}}), sometimes shortened as '''Kovai''' ({{IPA-ta|koːʋaj|IPA|Kovai.ogg}}), is one of the major [[Metropolitan cities of India |metropolitan cities]] in the [[States and union territories of India |Indian state]] of [[Tamil Nadu]]. It is located on the banks of the [[Noyyal River]] and surrounded by the [[Western Ghats]]. Coimbatore is the second largest city in Tamil Nadu after [[Chennai]] in terms of population and the 16th largest [[List of million-plus urban agglomerations in India |urban agglomeration in India]] as per the [[2011 Census of India |census 2011]]. It is the administrative capital of [[Coimbatore District]] and is administered by the [[Coimbatore Municipal Corporation]] which was established in 1981.

The region around Coimbatore was ruled by the [[Chera dynasty |Cheras]] during the [[Sangam period]] between the 1st and the 4th centuries CE and it served as the eastern entrance to the [[Palakkad Gap]], the principal trade route between the west coast and Tamil Nadu. Coimbatore was located along the ancient trade route Rajakesari Peruvazhi that extended from [[Muziris]] to [[Arikamedu]] in South India. The [[medieval Cholas]] conquered the [[Kongu Nadu]] in the 10th century CE. The region was ruled by [[Vijayanagara Empire]] in the 15th century followed by the [[Madurai Nayaks |Nayaks]] who introduced the [[Polygar |Palayakkarar system]] under which Kongu Nadu region was divided into 24 ''Palayams''. In the later part of the 18th century, the Coimbatore region came under the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] and following the [[Siege of Coimbatore |defeat]] of [[Tipu Sultan]] in the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]], the [[British East India Company]] annexed Coimbatore to the [[Madras Presidency]] in 1799. The Coimbatore region played a prominent role in the Second [[Poligar War]] (1801) when it was the area of operations of [[Dheeran Chinnamalai]].

In 1804, Coimbatore was established as the capital of the newly formed [[Coimbatore district]] and in 1866, it was accorded [[municipality]] status with [[Robert Stanes]] as its chairman. The city experienced a textile boom in the early 19th century due to the decline of the cotton industry in [[Mumbai]]. Post [[Independence of India |Independence]], Coimbatore has seen rapid growth due to industrialisation and is one of the largest exporters of [[jewellery]], [[wet grinder]]s, [[poultry]] and [[Automobile |auto components]]; the "[[Coimbatore Wet Grinder]]" and the "[[Kovai Cora Cotton]]" are recognised as [[Geographical Indications in India |Geographical Indications]] by the [[Government of India]]. Being a hub of textile industry in [[South India]], the city is referred to as the "Manchester of South India".

Coimbatore was ranked the best emerging city in India by [[India Today]] in the 2014 annual survey, fourth among Indian cities in investment climate by [[Confederation of Indian Industry]] and 17th among the top global outsourcing cities by Tholons. Coimbatore has been selected as one of the Indian cities to be developed as a [[smart city]] under the [[Smart Cities Mission]] and [[List of AMRUT Smart cities in Tamil Nadu|AMRUT]] by Government of India. Coimbatore regularly features among the top ten best cities to live in India and is amongst the safest cities in India for women according to [[National Crime Records Bureau]] report in 2015.

== Etymology ==
According to one theory, "Coimbatore" is a derivation of {{transl|ta|ISO|Kōvanpuddur}} ({{lit|new town of Kovan}}), after chieftain Kovan or Koyan, evolved into {{transl|ta|ISO|Kōyamputtūr}}<ref>{{cite news |title= Coimbatore to be known by its old name-Koyampuththoor |url=https://www.bbc.com/tamil/india-53009388 |access-date=14 October 2019 |work=BBC Tamil |date=14 October 2019 }}</ref> and later anglicised as ''Coimbatore''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/coimbatore-turning-modern-yet-retaining-its-old-charm/article2114224.ece |title=Coimbatore: turning modern, yet retaining its old charm |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=11 June 2020 |access-date=11 June 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017031054/http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/coimbatore-turning-modern-yet-retaining-its-old-charm/article2114224.ece |archive-date=17 October 2015 }}</ref> Another theory states that the name could have been derived from {{transl|ta|ISO|Kovaiamma}}.

The city is divided into two distinctive geographic regions: the dry eastern side which includes majority of the urban area of the city and the western region which borders the [[Nilgiris]], [[Anaimalai]] and [[Munnar]] ranges. [[Palghat Gap]], a mountain pass which connects the neighbouring state of [[Kerala]] to Tamil Nadu, lies to the west of the city. Because of its location in the [[biodiversity hotspot]] of the [[Western Ghats]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], the city is rich in [[fauna]] and [[flora]]. The Coimbatore urban wetlands harbours around 116 species of [[List of birds of Coimbatore |birds]], of which 66 are resident, 17 are migratory and 33 are local migrants.<ref name=birds>{{cite web |title=Conservation of bird life |url=http://eproceedings.worldscinet.com/9789814295048/9789814295048_0102.html |work=International Conference on CBEE, 2009 |publisher=World Scientific Publishing Company |access-date=9 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815185006/http://eproceedings.worldscinet.com/9789814295048/9789814295048_0102.html |archive-date=15 August 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[spot-billed pelican]], [[painted stork]], [[Asian openbill |openbill stork]], [[ibis]], [[Indian spot-billed duck]], [[teal]] and [[black-winged stilt]] visit the Coimbatore wetlands on their migration.<ref name="JReginald">{{cite journal |title=Birds of Singanallur lake, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu |author1=L.

The northern part of the city has a rich tropical [[evergreen forest]] with commercially significant trees such as [[teak]], [[sandalwood]], [[rosewood]] and [[bamboo]]. The soil is predominantly [[Chernozem |black]], which is suitable for cotton cultivation, but some [[red soil |red loamy soil]] is also found. According to the [[Bureau of Indian Standards]], Coimbatore falls under the Class III/IV [[Earthquake hazard zoning of India |Seismic Zone]], having experienced an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 on the [[Richter magnitude scale |Richter scale]] on 8 February 1900.<ref name=earthquake>{{cite news |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1627/16270870.htm |title=Dams and earthquakes |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=25 December 1999 |access-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811214221/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1627/16270870.htm |archive-date=11 August 2010 }}</ref>

Coimbatore has a tropical wet and dry climate. It experiences hot and humid summers from March to June with temperatures ranging from 25&nbsp;°C to 38&nbsp;°C. The monsoon season starts from July and lasts till October. The city receives moderate rainfall from the south-west monsoon and occasional heavy rainfall from the north-east monsoon. The winter season starts from November and ends in February. The temperatures during this season range from 20&nbsp;°C to 30&nbsp;°C.

Due to the south-west monsoon winds passing through the [[Palghat Gap |Palghat gap]], elevated regions of the city receive rainfall in the months from June to August. After a warm and foggy September, the north-east monsoon starts from October, lasting until early November. The average annual rainfall is around {{convert |600 |mm |1 |abbr=on }} with the northeast and the southwest monsoons contributing to 47% and 28% respectively to the total rainfall.<ref name="SHB002" /> This periodic rainfall does not satisfy the city's water requirements throughout the year and water supply schemes drawn from [[Siruvani River |Siruvani]] and Pilloor help supplant the requirements during low rainfall months.<ref>{{cite news |title=Experts to study feasibility of Athikadavu – Avanashi scheme |url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/03/18/stories/2010031858940100.htm |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=18 February 2009 |access-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918211612/http://www.hindu.com/2010/03/18/stories/2010031858940100.htm |archive-date=18 September 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Coimbatore Corporation begins efforts to avoid water scarcity |url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/03/18/stories/2010031858940100.htm |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=18 March 2010 |access-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918211612/http://www.hindu.com/2010/03/18/stories/2010031858940100.htm |archive-date=18 September 2013 }}</ref>
