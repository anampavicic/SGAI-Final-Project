Ipswich is divided into various [[Quarter (urban subdivision)|quarters]], with the town centre and the waterfront drawing the most footfall. The town centre features the retail shopping district and the historic [[town square]], known as the [[The Cornhill, Ipswich|Cornhill]]. The waterfront, south of the town centre on a meander of the River Orwell, offers a picturesque setting with a [[marina]], luxury yachts, high-rise apartment buildings, and a variety of restaurants and cafes. The waterfront is also home to the [[University of Suffolk]] campus.

Ipswich is surrounded by two [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty|Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB)]]: the [[Suffolk Coast and Heaths]] and [[Dedham Vale National Landscape|Dedham Vale]]. The town has a tourist sector, with 3.5 million people reported to have visited the town in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Howlett |first=Adam |title=Ipswich sees boom in tourism - with visitor numbers up 2.5% |url=https://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/ipswich-sees-boom-in-tourism-with-visitor-numbers-up-2-5-1-5174936 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190428135335/https://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/ipswich-sees-boom-in-tourism-with-visitor-numbers-up-2-5-1-5174936 |archive-date=28 April 2019 |access-date=28 April 2019 |website=Ipswich Star |date=30 August 2017 |language=en}}</ref> In 2020, Ipswich was ranked as an emerging global tourist destination by [[TripAdvisor]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=25 February 2020 |title=The top 25 emerging travel destinations |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/top-tripadvisor-travel-destinations-travellers-choice-2020-ipswich-kaliningrad-a9354951.html |access-date=25 February 2020 |website=The Independent |language=en}}</ref>

===Roman settlement===
A large [[Roman fort]], part of the coastal defences of Britain, stood at [[Walton, Suffolk|Walton]] near [[Felixstowe]] ({{convert|13|mi|km}},<ref>Fairclough J. and Plunkett S. J. 'Drawings of Walton Castle and other Monuments in Walton and Felixstowe', ''Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology and History'' 39 Part 4, 419–459. See also Fairclough J. ''Boudica to Raedwald: East Anglia's Relations with Rome'' (Malthouse Press, Ipswich 2010), 174–77.</ref> and the largest [[Roman villa]] in Suffolk (possibly an administrative complex) stood at Castle Hill (north-west Ipswich).<ref>The so-called 'Whitton' villa, see Fairclough J. ''Boudica to Raedwald'' (cited above), 134–145.</ref>

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Ipswich Ancient House.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient House, Ipswich]] is decorated with a particularly fine example of [[pargeting]].]]

The modern town took shape in Anglo-Saxon times (7th–8th centuries) around the [[Port of Ipswich]]. As the coastal states of north-western Europe emerged from the collapse of the Roman Empire, essential [[North Sea]] trade and communication between eastern Britain and the continent (especially to [[Scandinavia]], and through the [[Rhine]]) passed through the former Roman ports of [[Lundenwic|London]] (serving the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Mercia|Mercia]], the [[Kingdom of Essex|East Saxons]], [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]]) and [[York]] (Eoforwic) (serving the [[Kingdom of Northumbria]]).

''Gipeswic'' (also in other spellings such as ''Gippeswich'')<ref>Bowen, Emanuel "An Accurate Map of the County of Suffolk Divided into its Hundreds c. 1760"</ref> arose as the equivalent to these, serving the [[Kingdom of East Anglia]],<ref name=":0" /><ref>Hodges, R.

The famous ship-burial and treasure at [[Sutton Hoo]] nearby ({{convert|9|mi|km|disp=semicolon}}) is probably his grave. The [[Ipswich Museum]] houses [[replica]]s of the Roman [[Mildenhall Treasure|Mildenhall]] and [[Sutton Hoo treasure]]s. A gallery devoted to the town's origins includes [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[weapon]]s, [[jewellery]] and other artefacts.

The seventh-century town was centred near the quay. Around 700 AD, Frisian potters from the [[Netherlands]] area settled in Ipswich and set up the first large-scale potteries in England since Roman times. Their wares were traded far across England, and the industry was unique to Ipswich for 200 years.<ref>K. Wade, "Gipeswic – East Anglia's First Economic Capital 600–1066", in Salmon N. P. and Malster R. (Eds), ''Ipswich From the First to the Third Millennium'' (Papers from an Ipswich Society Symposium), (Ipswich Society, Ipswich 2001), 1–6, at pp. 3–4.</ref><ref>Plunkett S. J. ''Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times'' (Tempus, Stroud 2005), 130–133, 201.</ref> With growing prosperity, in about 720 AD a large new part of the town was laid out in the Buttermarket area. Ipswich was becoming a place of national and international importance.<ref>Wade 2001.</ref> Parts of the ancient road plan still survive in its modern streets.

After the invasion of 869, Ipswich fell under [[Viking]] rule. The earth ramparts circling the town centre were probably raised by Vikings in Ipswich around 900 to prevent its recapture by the English.<ref>Wade 2001, 5.</ref><ref>Malster R. ''A History of Ipswich'' (Phillimore, Chichester 2000), 13.</ref> They were unsuccessful. The town operated a [[Mint (coin)|mint]] under royal licence from King [[Edgar I of England|Edgar]] in the 970s, which continued through the [[Norman Conquest]] until the time of [[John of England|King John]], in about 1215.<ref>North J.

Example figure:[[Aethelred II]] first hand type, Plate X no. 23, Cat. 766 & p. 120.</ref> The abbreviation ''Gipes'' appears on the coins.

King John granted the town its first [[Municipal charter|charter]] in 1200, laying the medieval foundations of its modern civil government.<ref>Martin, Geoffrey "The Medieval and Early Modern Borough" in Salmon N. P. and Malster R. (eds), ''Ipswich From the First to the Third Millennium'' (Papers from an Ipswich Society Symposium), (Ipswich Society, Ipswich 2001), 7–17.</ref><ref>Text of charter (translated into English) and image of 1200 Town Seal, see [[John Wodderspoon|Wodderspoon, J.]], ''Memorials of the Ancient Town of Ipswich'' (Pawsey (Ipswich): Longman, Brown, Green & Longmans (London) 1850), 'Ancient Incorporation of the Town', pp 75–130, at pp 75–85.</ref> Thenceforth Ipswich strongly maintained its jurisdiction over the Liberty of Ipswich, an administrative area extending over about 35 square kilometres centred on the town.<ref>Briggs, Keith "The bounds of the Liberty of Ipswich", ''Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology and History'' 44, 19-38 (2017)</ref>

In the next four centuries it made the most of its wealth. Five large religious houses, including two [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] Priories (St Peter and St Paul, and Holy Trinity, both mid-12th century<ref>Malster 2000, 41–45.</ref><ref>Briggs, Keith "The rentals of Holy Trinity Priory in Ipswich", ''Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology and History'' 44, 456-461 (2019)</ref>), and those of the [[Ipswich Greyfriars]] ([[Franciscans]], before 1298), [[Ipswich Whitefriars]] ([[Carmelites]] founded 1278–79) and [[Ipswich Blackfriars]] ([[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], before 1263), stood in medieval Ipswich. The last Carmelite Prior of Ipswich was the celebrated [[John Bale]], author of the oldest English historical verse-drama (''Kynge Johan'', {{circa|1538}}).<ref>B. Zimmerman, 1899, 'The White Friars at Ipswich', ''Proc. Suffolk Institute of Archaeology'' 10 Part 2, 196–204, at p. 199.</ref> There were also several hospitals, including the leper hospital of St Mary Magdalene, founded before 1199.

During the Middle Ages the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Marian]] Shrine of [[Our Lady of Ipswich|Our Lady of Grace]] was a famous [[pilgrimage]] destination, and attracted many pilgrims including [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Katherine of Aragon]].<ref>Wodderspoon 1850, 331–332.</ref><ref>Malster 2000, 43–47, 63–67.</ref> At the Reformation the statue was taken away to London to be burned, though some claim that it survived and is preserved at [[Nettuno]], Italy.<ref>Malster 2000, 67.</ref>

Around 1380, [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] satirised the merchants of Ipswich in ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''. [[Thomas Wolsey]], the future [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], was born in Ipswich in 1473 as the son of a wealthy landowner. One of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s closest political allies, he founded a [[college]] in the town in 1528, which was for its brief duration one of the homes of the [[Ipswich School]].<ref>Blatchly J. M. ''A Famous Antient Seed-Plot of Learning'' (Ipswich School 2003), 27–41.</ref> He remains one of the town's most famed figures.

During the 14th to 17th centuries Ipswich was a [[kontor]] for the [[Hanseatic League]], the port being used for imports and exports to the [[Baltic region|Baltic]].

In the time of [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]] the [[Ipswich Martyrs]] were burnt at the stake on the Cornhill for their [[Protestant]] beliefs. A monument commemorating this event now stands in [[Christchurch Park]]. Ipswich was a printing, [[Bookselling|bookseller]] centre, and an entrepôt for continental books in the 16th century.<ref>King, John N. (1982) ''The English Reformation Literature: the Tudor Origins of the Protestant Tradition'' Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. pp. 100f. {{ISBN|9780691065021}}.</ref> From 1611 to 1634 Ipswich was a major centre for emigration to [[New England]]. This was encouraged by the Town Lecturer, [[Samuel Ward (minister)|Samuel Ward]]. His brother [[Nathaniel Ward]] was first minister of [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich]], Massachusetts, where a promontory was named 'Castle Hill' after the place of that name in north-west Ipswich, UK. Ipswich was also one of the main ports of embarkation for puritans leaving other [[East Anglia]]n towns and villages for the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] during the 1630s and what has become known as the [[Great Migration (Puritan)|Great Migration]].<ref>Thompson, Roger, Mobility & Migration, East Anglian Founders of New England, 1629–1640, Amherst: Univ. of Massachusetts Press, 1994</ref>

The painter [[Thomas Gainsborough]] lived and worked in Ipswich. In 1835, [[Charles Dickens]] stayed in Ipswich and used it as a setting for scenes in his novel ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]''. The hotel where he resided first opened in 1518; it was then known as The Tavern and later became known as the [[Great White Horse Hotel]]. Dickens made the hotel famous in chapter XXII of ''The Pickwick Papers'', vividly describing the hotel's meandering corridors and stairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dickens-online.info/the-pickwick-papers-page196.html |title=The Pickwick Papers|first=Charles|last=Dickens|publisher=Charles Dickens online|page=196}}</ref>

In 1824 Dr [[George Birkbeck]], with support from several local businessmen, founded one of the first [[Mechanics' Institutes]], which survives to this day as the independent Ipswich Institute reading room and library.<ref>[http://ipswichinstitute.org.uk/ Ipswich Institute reading room and library]</ref> The building is located at 15 Tavern Street.

In the mid-19th century [[coprolite]] (fossilised animal dung) was discovered; the material was mined and then dissolved in [[acid]], the resulting mixture forming the basis of [[Fisons]] fertiliser business.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fisons at the root of modern agriculture |url=http://www.yara.com/en/about/history/stories/fisons_inter.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520151251/http://www.yara.com/en/about/history/stories/fisons_inter.html |archive-date=20 May 2006 |access-date=17 June 2007}}</ref>

The [[Tolly Cobbold]] brewery, built in the 18th century and rebuilt in 1894–96, is one of the finest [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[brewery|breweries]] in the UK.

[[Ransomes & Rapier]] was a major British manufacturer of railway equipment and later cranes, from 1869 to 1987. There was a [[sugar beet]] factory at Ipswich for many years; it was closed in 2001 as part of a rationalisation by [[British Sugar]]. This agricultural link is preserved in the [[Ipswich Town F.C.|local football club]]'s nickname "The Tractor Boys". Phillips & Piper Ltd on Old Foundry Road employed many women who sewed equestrian and hunt jackets for Harrods, Pytchley, and other labels for 130 years, finally closing down in June 1982.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Days Gone By - Sew many wonderful memories of Phillips and Piper clothing works in Ipswich |url=https://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/days-gone-by-sew-many-wonderful-memories-of-phillips-and-piper-clothing-works-in-ipswich-1-4613560 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181226084445/https://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/days-gone-by-sew-many-wonderful-memories-of-phillips-and-piper-clothing-works-in-ipswich-1-4613560 |archive-date=26 December 2018 |access-date=26 December 2018 |website=Ipswich Star |date=13 July 2016 |language=en}}</ref>

[[File:Willis Building Ipswich.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|230x230px|The [[Willis Building (Ipswich)|Willis Building]] in Ipswich was one of [[Foster and Partners|Foster + Partners]] earliest commissions, built in 1975.]]

The [[British Telecom|British Telecom Research Laboratories]] were located to the east of the town in 1975 at [[Martlesham Heath]]; it is now a [[science park]] called [[Adastral Park]]. The area was originally [[RAF Martlesham Heath]], a World War II airfield. Part of the old airfield is now the site of [[Suffolk Constabulary]]'s police headquarters.

A key employment sector is insurance, both wholesale and retail sectors. Some of the major players with a key presence in Ipswich include [[AXA|Axa]], [[Churchill Insurance|Churchill]], [[Legal & General]], [[Liverpool Victoria|LV]] and [[Willis Towers Watson]]. Access to a skilled and experienced workforce has also led to the establishment of ancillary businesses serving these companies, including call centres dealing with sales and claims.

Ipswich is one of the [[Haven ports]] and is still a working port, handling several million tonnes of [[cargo]] each year. Prior to decommissioning, [[HMS Grafton (F80)|HMS ''Grafton'']] was a regular visitor to the port and has special links with the town and the county of Suffolk. [[HMS Orwell|HMS ''Orwell'']], named after the river, is also closely linked with Ipswich.

Ipswich has a rich history of public swimming. During the 1830s, there were at least three designated swimming places - one was near St Cement's, the second was next to [[St Mary-at-the-Quay Church, Ipswich|St Mary-At-The Quay]] and the third not far from [[Stoke Bridge]]. These were all closed in the late 1830s during the building of the wet dock.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ipswich Historic Lettering: Water |url=https://www.ipswich-lettering.co.uk/water.html |access-date=2024-02-24 |website=www.ipswich-lettering.co.uk}}</ref> A designated enclosed area of the [[River Orwell]], called [[Stoke Bathing Place]], was created to cater for the swimmers. It was damaged in the floods of 1953 but maps show the swimming place still in situ as late as 1973.

==Education==
===Schools===
{{Main|List of schools in Suffolk}}
[[File:Ipswich School.jpg|thumb|[[Ipswich School]] was established in 1399.|alt=|265x265px]]
[[File:University Campus Suffolk , Ipswich Waterfront - geograph.org.uk - 1077464.jpg|thumb|The Waterfront Building of the [[University of Suffolk]]|300x300px]]

State-funded secondary schools include comprehensive schools such as [[Copleston High School]], [[St Alban's Catholic High School, Ipswich|St Alban's Catholic High School]], Holbrook Academy, Holbrook Primary and [[Northgate High School, Ipswich|Northgate High School]] and academies such as [[Ipswich Academy]] and [[Chantry Academy]]. Ipswich is also home to several independent schools, including [[Royal Hospital School]], [[Ipswich School]] (both are co-educational and members of the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]]), [[Ipswich High School, Suffolk|Ipswich High School]] (has recently changed from girls only to girls and boys) and [[St Joseph's College, Ipswich|St Joseph's College]] (Catholic, co-educational) which hosts an international summer camp.

===Further and higher education===
[[Suffolk New College]] is a [[further education]] college located in Ipswich, serving students from the town and wider area. There is also a [[sixth form college]], [[One (sixth form college)|One]], which serves students from the same area.

Ipswich is the location of the [[University of Suffolk]], [[Suffolk]]'s first Higher Education Institution (HEI), established in 2007. It was originally University Campus Suffolk, a collaborative venture involving the [[University of Essex]] in [[Colchester]], the [[University of East Anglia]] in [[Norwich]], various further education colleges and Suffolk County Council. However, the university was granted its own degree awarding powers in November 2015, and in May 2016 it was awarded university status. The university was renamed to the University of Suffolk in August 2016, prior to its former name University Campus Suffolk.<ref>{{Cite news |date=17 May 2016 |title=Campus renamed as independent university |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-36307221 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201042713/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-36307221 |archive-date=1 December 2017 |access-date=21 July 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Anonymous |date=4 July 2016 |title=University Campus Suffolk gains approval to become the University of Suffolk |url=https://www.ucs.ac.uk/About/News/2016/20160517_University-Campus-Suffolk-gains-approval-to-become-the-University-of-Suffolk.aspx |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521083104/http://www.ucs.ac.uk/About/News/2016/20160517_University-Campus-Suffolk-gains-approval-to-become-the-University-of-Suffolk.aspx |archive-date=21 May 2016 |access-date=18 May 2016}}</ref>

==Climate==
Ipswich experiences an [[oceanic climate]], like the rest of the British Isles, with a narrow range of temperature and rainfall spread evenly throughout the year. One of the two nearest for which data is available is East Bergholt, about {{convert|7|mi|0|abbr=out}} south west of the town centre and at a similar elevation, and similar river valley/estuary situation. The average July maximum of {{convert|23.2|C}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=1971–0 July average maximum |url=http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/calcdetail.php?seasonid=13&periodid=1971-2000&indexid=TX&stationid=1841 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127154940/http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/calcdetail.php?seasonid=13&periodid=1971-2000&indexid=TX&stationid=1841 |archive-date=27 November 2011 |access-date=26 February 2011}}</ref> is the third-highest for a major settlement in the country, behind London and Colchester, illustrating the relative warmth of the area during the summer part of the year.

Typically, 24.9 days of the year will record a maximum temperature of {{convert|25.1|C}} or above, and the warmest day of the year should reach {{convert|30.0|C}},<ref>{{Cite web |title=1971–00 Average warmest day |url=http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/calcdetail.php?seasonid=5&periodid=1971-2000&indexid=TXx&stationid=1841 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127154101/http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/calcdetail.php?seasonid=5&periodid=1971-2000&indexid=TXx&stationid=1841 |archive-date=27 November 2011 |access-date=26 February 2011}}</ref> on average.

In an average year, 55.33 nights will report an air frost. The lowest temperature to be recorded in recent years was {{convert|-14.5|C}} during December 2010.<ref>{{Cite web |title=2010 Minimum |url=http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/monitordetail.php?seasonid=18&year=2010&indexid=TNn&stationid=1841 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426211824/http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/monitordetail.php?seasonid=18&year=2010&indexid=TNn&stationid=1841 |archive-date=26 April 2014 |access-date=25 February 2013}}</ref>

As with much of East Anglia, rainfall is low, averaging 569.3mm<ref>{{Cite web |title=1971–00 average annual rainfall |url=http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/calcdetail.php?seasonid=0&periodid=1971-2000&indexid=RR&stationid=1841 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127150112/http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/calcdetail.php?seasonid=0&periodid=1971-2000&indexid=RR&stationid=1841 |archive-date=27 November 2011 |access-date=26 February 2011}}</ref> in a typical year, with 103.8 days of the year<ref>{{Cite web |title=1971–00 annual average raindays |url=http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/calcdetail.php?seasonid=0&periodid=1971-2000&indexid=RR1&stationid=1841 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127151212/http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/calcdetail.php?seasonid=0&periodid=1971-2000&indexid=RR1&stationid=1841 |archive-date=27 November 2011 |access-date=26 February 2011}}</ref> reporting over 1mm of rain. All averages refer to the period 1971–2000.

The weather station at [[Levington]] is even closer than East Bergholt at {{convert|9.4|km|order=flip}} from the town centre further down the river estuary on the way to [[Felixstowe]]. It has a slightly more marine climate than East Bergholt, with slightly lower highs and milder lows throughout the year in the 1981–2010 average period. It is slightly less prone to frosts, averaging 35.5 such occurrences in a calendar year.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ipswich Climate Averages 1981-2010 |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate/u12b4mhxm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518065140/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate/u12b4mhxm |archive-date=18 May 2015 |access-date=8 May 2015 |publisher=Met Office}}</ref> Sunshine levels at 1,707.7 hours per annum are relatively high for the British Isles, but not abnormal for southern parts of England.

[[Wattisham]] is {{convert|16|miles|order=flip}} from Ipswich, but has a higher altitude of {{convert|86|m|order=flip}}. As a result, high temperatures there are a little lower than East Bergholt and Levington, but lows are similar. In average year, there are around 43 nights of frost recorded at Wattisham (as well as two days of frost), and one day when the temperature exceeds {{convert|30|C}}.
