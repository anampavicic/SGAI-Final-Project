{{Nihongo|'''Sendai'''|仙台市|Sendai-shi|extra={{IPA|ja|seꜜndai||TomJ-Sendai.ogg}}}} is the capital [[Cities of Japan|city]] of [[Miyagi Prefecture]] and the largest city in the [[Tōhoku region]]. {{As of|2023|08|01}}, the city had a population of 1,098,335 in 539,698 households,<ref name="City of Sendai Estimated Population and Demographics">{{cite web |title=推計人口及び人口動態 |url=http://www.city.sendai.jp/chosatoke/shise/toke/jinko/suike.html |website=仙台市役所 City of Sendai |access-date=1 April 2023 |language=ja}}</ref> and is one of Japan's 20 [[Cities designated by government ordinance of Japan|designated cities]]. The city was founded in 1600 by the ''[[daimyō]]'' [[Date Masamune]]. It is nicknamed the {{Nihongo|''City of Trees''|杜の都|Mori no Miyako}}; there are [[Japanese zelkova]] trees lining many of the main thoroughfares such as {{Nihongo|Jōzenji Street|定禅寺通|Jōzenji dōri}} and {{nihongo|Aoba Street|青葉通|Aoba dōri}}.
In the summer, the [[Sendai Tanabata Festival]], the largest [[Tanabata]] festival in Japan, is held. In winter, the trees are decorated with thousands of lights for the {{nihongo|Pageant of Starlight|光のページェント|Hikari no pējento}}, lasting through most of December. The city is also home to [[Tohoku University]], consistently ranked amongst the top institutions of higher education in Japan.

== History ==
=== Edo period ===
Although the Sendai area was inhabited as early as 20,000 years ago, the history of Sendai as a city begins from 1600, when the ''[[daimyō]]'' [[Date Masamune]] relocated. Masamune was not happy with his previous stronghold, [[Iwadeyama, Miyagi|Iwadeyama]], which was located in the northern portion of his territories and was difficult to access from [[Edo]] (modern-day Tokyo). Sendai was an ideal location, being in the centre of Masamune's newly defined territories, upon the major road from Edo. [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] gave Masamune permission to build a new castle in Aobayama after the [[Battle of Sekigahara]]. The previous ruler of the Sendai area had used a castle located on Aobayama. At this time Sendai was written as {{Nihongo2|千代}} ("a thousand generations"), because a temple with a {{Nihongo|'''thousand [[Buddharupa|Buddha]] statues'''|千体|sentai}} used to be located in Aobayama. Masamune changed the ''[[kanji]]'' to "{{lang|ja|仙臺}}", which later became "{{lang|ja|仙台}}" (literally: "hermit/wizard" plus "platform/plateau" or figuratively, "hermit on a platform/high ground"). The character came from a Chinese poem that praised a palace created by the [[Emperor Wen of Han China]] (reigned 180–157 BCE), comparing it to a mythical palace in the [[Kunlun Mountains]]. Tradition says that Masamune chose this ''kanji'' so that the castle would prosper as long as a mountain inhabited by an immortal hermit.

Masamune ordered the construction of [[Aoba Castle|Sendai Castle]] in December 1600 and the construction of the surrounding [[castle town]] in 1601. The grid plan roads in modern-day central Sendai are based upon his plans.

=== Modern era ===
The first railway line between Sendai and Tokyo, now the [[Tōhoku Main Line]], opened in 1887, bringing the area within a day's travel from Tokyo for the first time in history. [[Tohoku University|Tohoku Imperial University]], the region's first university, was founded in Sendai in 1907 and became the first Japanese university to admit female students in 1913.

Sendai was incorporated as a city on 1 April 1889, with the post-[[Meiji restoration]] creation of the modern municipalities system following the [[abolition of the han system]]. At the time of incorporation, the city's area was {{convert|17.45|km2}} and its population was 86,000. The city grew, however, through seven annexations that occurred between 1928 and 1988. The city became a [[City designated by government ordinance|designated city]] on 1 April 1989; the city's population exceeded one million in 1999.

Sendai was considered to be one of Japan's greenest cities, mostly because of its great numbers of trees and plants. Sendai became known as The City of Trees before the [[Meiji Restoration]], after the feudal [[Sendai Domain]] encouraged residents to plant trees in their gardens. As a result, many houses, temples, and shrines in central Sendai had {{Nihongo|'''household forests'''|屋敷林|yashikirin}}, which were used as resources for wood and other everyday materials.

In 1925, the [[Senseki Line]] to [[Sendai Station (Miyagi)|Sendai Station]] became the first underground railway segment in Japan, preceding the opening of the [[Tokyo Metro Ginza Line]] (Asia's first subway line) by two years.

The [[2nd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|2nd Infantry Division]] was known as the "Sendai Division" as it was based in Sendai, and recruited locally. During the Second World War it was involved in many different campaigns, but one of the most important was the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]]. During the [[bombing of Sendai during World War II]] by the United States on 10 July 1945, much of the historic center of the city was burned, with 2,755 inhabitants killed and 11,933 houses destroyed in the city.

===Postwar development===
Following World War II, the city was rebuilt, and Sendai became a vital transportation and logistics hub for the Tōhoku region with the construction of major arteries such as the [[Tōhoku Expressway]] and [[Tōhoku Shinkansen]].

In the early 1950s, the [[United States Army, Japan]] operated Camp Schimmelpfennig and Camp Sendai in the city.

Sendai has been subject to several major earthquakes in recent history, including the [[1978 Miyagi earthquake]], which was a catalyst for the development of Japan's current earthquake resistance standards, and the [[2005 Miyagi earthquake]]. Most recently, the coastal area of Sendai, including [[Sendai Airport]], was severely damaged in the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]].<ref name="USGS"/><ref name="UKFO"/><ref name="TELG"/><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/14/world/asia/14sendai.html | work=The New York Times | first=Martin | last=Fackler | title=At Sendai City Hall, a Relief Center, Thousands Wait and Wonder What's Next | date=13 March 2011}}</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12709598 Sendai BBC report]</ref> The tsunami reportedly reached as far as [[Wakabayashi-ku, Sendai|Wakabayashi Ward]] Office, {{convert|8|km|sp=us}} from the coastline. Thousands were killed, and countless more were injured and/or made homeless. Sendai's port was heavily damaged and temporarily closed, reopening on 16 April 2011.<ref>[[Kyodo News]], "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110417a5.html Sendai port reopens for business]", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', 17 April 2011, p. 1.</ref>

==Geography==
Sendai is located at lat. 38°16'05" north, long. 140°52'11" east. The city's area is {{cvt|788.09|km2}}, and stretches from the Pacific Ocean to the [[Ōu Mountains]], which are the east and west borders of Miyagi Prefecture. As a result, the city's geography is quite diverse. Eastern Sendai is a plains area, the center of the city is hilly, and western areas are mountainous. The highest point in the city is [[Mount Funagata]] which stands {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Unique among Japan's large coastal cities, Sendai's city core is built on a terrace at {{cvt|40.|–|60.|m}} elevation.

The Sendai basin area is {{convert|939|km2|0|abbr=on}} (the mountainous area is {{convert|675|km2|0|abbr=on}}, the plain area is {{convert|245|km2|0|abbr=on}} and the water body is {{convert|20|km2|0|abbr=on}}). The basin consists of urban areas, paddy fields and forests. The mid and upstream areas have forests. The [[Natori River]] flows through the area and reaches Sendai Bay after {{convert|55|km|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Chen | first = Yangbo | chapter = Study Basin | title = GIS and Remote Sensing in Hydrology, Water Resources and Environment  | publisher =  International Association of Hydrological Sciences (September 1, 2004) | year = 2004 | pages = 392–393 | isbn = 978-1901502725 }}</ref>

The {{nihongo|'''Hirose River'''|広瀬川|Hirose-gawa}} flows {{convert|45|km|0|abbr=off}} through Sendai. The river is well known as a symbol of Sendai, especially because it appears in the lyrics of Aoba-jō Koi-uta (青葉城恋唄; literally, ''The Aoba Castle Love Song''), a popular song sung by Muneyuki Satō. [[Aoba Castle]] was built close to the river to use the river as a natural [[moat]]. The river frequently flooded until the 1950s, but dams and levees constructed in the 1960s and 1970s have made such floods rare.

Most mountains in Sendai are dormant volcanoes, much older than the more famous [[Mount Zaō]] and [[Naruko (volcano)|Naruko]] volcanoes in nearby municipalities. However, many [[hot springs]] can be found in the city, indicating [[hydrothermal circulation|hydrothermal activity]]. The Miyagi Oki [[earthquake]] occurs offshore Sendai once every 25 to 40 years. The 7.2 magnitude [[2005 Miyagi earthquake]], which occurred on August 16, 2005, had an epicenter close to the ''Miyagi Oki'' earthquake area. However, the Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion concluded that it was not the ''Miyagi Oki'' earthquake, saying "...the recent event is not thought to be this earthquake. This is because the magnitude of the earthquake was small, and the source area, which was estimated from the aftershock distribution and seismic waves, didn't cover the whole expected source region. Although, the recent event ruptured a part of the focal region of the expected earthquake."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jishin.go.jp/main/chousa/05aug_miyagi/index-e.htm|title=Earthquake Off-shore of Miyagi Prefecture on August 16, 2005|publisher=Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion|date=August 17, 2005|access-date=March 18, 2011}}</ref> In 2011, the 9.0 magnitude [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|2011 Tōhoku earthquake]] occurred offshore Sendai, resulting in a devastating tsunami.

===Wards===
Sendai has five [[Wards of Japan|wards]] ("ku"), which were created when it became a [[Cities designated by government ordinance of Japan|designated city]] in 1989. The city consciously avoided names that included directions (e.g., north {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|北}}}}, center {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|中央}}}}) when it chose names for the new wards.

===Climate===
Sendai has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), which features warm and wet summers, and cool and dry winters. Sendai summers are not as hot as [[Tokyo]] to the south, while the winters are much milder than [[Sapporo]] to the north, but retains significant seasonal differences in temperature and rainfall. Extremes range from {{cvt|−11.7|to|37.2|°C}}. Of Japan's prefectural capitals, Sendai experiences the fewest days of extreme temperatures (highs outside {{cvt|0|-|30|C}}) at 19.6 per year, compared to Tokyo's average of 49.

Winters are cool and relatively dry, with January temperatures averaging {{convert|1.5|°C|1}}. Snowfall is much lower than cities on the [[Sea of Japan]] coast, such as [[Niigata (city)|Niigata]] and [[Tottori (city)|Tottori]]. Summers are very warm and much of the year's precipitation is delivered at this time, with an August average of {{convert|24.1|°C|1}}. The city is rarely hit by [[typhoon]]s, and experiences only 6 days with more than {{convert|10|cm|in|0}} of rainfall on average. Sendai's [[monsoon]] season usually begins in late April to early October, which is later than in most cities in Japan. During this season, cold winds from the Okhotsk air mass, called "[[Yamase]]", blow in and depress daytime highs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=2265012|title=Classification of the Yamase (cold northeasterly wind around northeastern Japan) based upon its air-mass vertical structures}}

== Demographics ==
{{As of|2023|03|01}}, the city had an estimated population of 1,097,407 and a population density of 1,397 persons per km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name="City of Sendai Estimated Population and Demographics" /> The city's total area was 786.35&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. 

The 2000 National Census revealed that 88.5% of the city's population (892,252 people) lived in a 129.69&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> area, which is 16.6% of the city's total area. The population density in this area was 6,879.9 persons per km<sup>2</sup>, more than 5 times higher than the city's average population density at that time, 1,286.6 persons per km<sup>2</sup>. Approximately 10,000 people in Sendai were non-Japanese citizens.

Sendai had 525,828 households in 2020. The average household had approximately 2.07 members. The average household was becoming smaller every year, because single-member households were increasing. At this time Sendai had more people in their early 50s and in their 20s and early 30s than in other age groups. This is a result of the first and second baby booms in Japan, and university students. The average age in Sendai is 38.4, which makes the city one of the youngest major cities in Japan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.city.sendai.jp/chosatoke/shise/toke/jinko/documents/r0109.xlsx|title=推計人口及び人口動態 - 令和元年9月1日現在}}</ref>

== Governance ==
[[File:Sendai City Hall 2023.jpg|thumb|Sendai City Hall|alt=]]

Sendai's political system is similar to other cities in Japan, because the [[Local Autonomy Law]] makes all municipalities uniform in terms of organization and power. However, Sendai is a designated city, so it has the same jurisdiction as [[Prefecture#Japanese sense of prefecture|prefectures]] in some areas.

Sendai has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city legislature. The [[city council|Sendai City Assembly]] members are elected from 5 elective districts, which correspond to the city's 5 wards. The number of assembly members allocated to each ward is based upon population. As of May 2005, the city has 60 assembly members; 17 from Aoba Ward, 11 from Miyagino, 8 from Wakabayashi, 13 from Taihaku, and 11 from Izumi. The City Assembly elects an Assembly Chairperson and Vice Chairperson. Sendai has two vice mayors, who are not elected by the populace. Miyagi contributes 24 seats to the Miyagi Prefectural legislature. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between the Miyagi 1st district and the Miyagi 2nd district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

== Economy ==
[[File:Sendai Metropolitan Employment Area.svg|thumb|200px|Sendai [[Urban Employment Area|MEA]]]]

Sendai is the center of the Tōhoku region's economy, and is the base of the region's logistics and transportation. The [[GDP]] in Greater Sendai, Sendai [[Urban Employment Area|Metropolitan Employment Area]] (1.6 million people), is US$61.7 billion in 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.csis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/UEA/uea_data_e.htm|title = Metropolitan Employment Area (MEA) Data|author = Yoshitsugu Kanemoto|publisher = Center for Spatial Information Science, The [[University of Tokyo]]}}</ref><ref>[https://data.oecd.org/conversion/exchange-rates.htm Conversion rates – Exchange rates] – OECD Data</ref> Sendai city by itself has a nominal GDP of approximately US$50 billion {{As of|2015|lc=y}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.city.sendai.jp/chosatoke/shise/toke/tokesho/h30-01/documents/11-1_4.xlsx|title=経済活動別 市内総生産（名目）|date=May 2018|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref> The city's economy heavily relies upon retail and services – the two industries provide approximately two thirds of the employment and close to half of the establishments.

Sendai is frequently called a branch-office economy{{By whom|date=June 2019}}, because very few major companies are headquartered in the city. Various authorities are cooperating to alleviate this problem, primarily by encouraging high-tech ventures from [[Tohoku University]], which is well known for its science and engineering departments. There are also incentives for startups available from the prefectural government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jetro.go.jp/en/invest/region/miyagi.html|title=Miyagi: General Business Information {{!}} Investing in Japan's local regions – Investing in Japan – Japan External Trade Organization – JETRO}}</ref>

[[Tohoku Electric Power]], a major regional supplier of electric power, has its headquarters in Sendai and also operates the [[Shin-Sendai Thermal Power Station]] located within the city.

Sendai's economic growth rate has stabilized since the 2011 Japan earthquake. The growth rate was only 0.4% in 2011 after the quake created economic turmoil in coastal areas. The year after, in 2012 the rate spiked to 10.4% after reconstruction efforts. It has since fallen to a closer trend to what is expected of 3.7% in 2013.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.city.sendai.jp/kezai-chose/kurashi/machi/kezaikoyo/kezai/documents/2016koukaiban.pdf|title=Industry in Sendai 2016|date=2016|website=Sendai City|access-date=November 11, 2016|archive-date=February 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214205738/http://www.city.sendai.jp/kezai-chose/kurashi/machi/kezaikoyo/kezai/documents/2016koukaiban.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The most well-known streets in Sendai, {{Nihongo|Jozenji-Dori|定禅寺通り}} and {{Nihongo|Aoba-Dori|青葉通り}}, are both lined with [[Japanese Zelkova|Japanese zelkovas]]. These are symbols of "The City of Trees". Jozenji-Dori has a promenade and a few sculptures. It is a place of relaxation. Many events and festivals, such as the Sendai Pageant of Starlight and the Jozenji Street Jazz Festival, take place on Jozenji-Dori and in {{Nihongo|Kōtōdai Park|匂当台公園}}. Aoba-Dori is the main business road in Sendai. Other major roads in the city include Hirose-Dori ([[ginkgo]]), and Higashi-Nibancho-Dori.

===Festivals===
The most [[Japanese festivals|famous festival]] in Sendai is Tanabata, which attracts more than 2 million visitors every year and is the largest [[Tanabata]] Festival in Japan. It is relatively quiet compared to other traditional Japanese festivals, because its main attractions are intricate Tanabata decorations.

The Aoba Matsuri Festival follows more typical Japanese festival traditions, with a [[mikoshi]], [[float (parade)|floats]], a samurai parade, and traditional dancing.<ref>[http://www.aoba-matsuri.com/english/e-history.html A History of Sendai Aoba Matsuri<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Local people burn their [[Japanese New Year|New Year]] decorations and pray for health in the new year during the Dontosai Festival, the oldest festival in Miyagi Prefecture.

Various contemporary festivals also take place in Sendai, such as the Jōzenji Streetjazz Festival, the Michinoku Yosakoi Festival, and the Sendai Pageant of Starlight. The Jōzenji Streetjazz Festival is one of the largest amateur music festivals in Japan. It began as a jazz festival in 1991, but soon began to accept applications from all genres. The Michinoku Yosakoi festival is a dance festival, derived from the [[Yosakoi Festival]] that takes place in [[Kōchi, Kōchi|Kōchi]]. Trees in downtown Sendai are decorated with lights during the Sendai Pageant of Starlights. The event provided the idea for the Festival of Lights annually held in [[Riverside, California|Riverside]], Sendai's sister city. In 2005, the streets were lit up with one million miniature bulbs.

===Specialties and crafts===
[[File:Gyutan teishoku.JPG|thumb|left|200px|''[[Gyūtan]] [[teishoku]]'', a [[table d'hôte]] of beef tongue]]

Sendai is the origin of several foods, including ''[[gyūtan]]'' (beef tongue, usually grilled), [[hiyashi chūka]] (cold Chinese noodles), and [[robatayaki]] (Japanese-style barbecue). However, robatayaki was later introduced to [[Kushiro, Hokkaido|Kushiro]], which developed and popularized the dish. As a result, many people believe Kushiro is the origin of Robatayaki. Zundamochi (ずんだ餅, [[mochi]] balls with sweet, bright green edamame paste), and sasakamaboko (笹かまぼこ, [[kamaboko]] shaped like bamboo leaves) are also considered to be Sendai specialties. Sendai is also known for good [[sashimi]], [[sushi]], and [[sake]]. This is because Sendai is near several major fishing ports, such as [[Kesennuma, Miyagi|Kesennuma]], [[Ishinomaki, Miyagi|Ishinomaki]], and [[Shiogama, Miyagi|Shiogama]], and the fact that Miyagi Prefecture is a major producer of [[rice]]. There are many [[ramen]] restaurants in Sendai, and the area is known for a particular spicy [[miso]] [[ramen]]. Also, Sendai station offers the most types of [[ekiben]] of any station in Japan. In autumn, many people organise Imonikai, a sort of picnic by the river which involves making a potato stew called ''[[Imoni]]''.

Many crafts from Sendai were originally created under the influence of the Date family during the [[Edo period]]. Examples are Sendai Hira, a hand woven silk fabric, Tsutsumiyaki pottery, and [[washi|Yanagiu Washi paper]]. However, some crafts, such as umoregi zaiku (crafts created from fossil wood) were developed by low-ranking samurai who needed side jobs to survive. [[Kokeshi]] dolls were popularized by hot spring resorts that sold them as gifts. Some relatively recent developments include Sendai Tsuishu [[lacquer]]ware and Tamamushinuri lacquerware, both of which were developed after the [[Meiji Restoration]].

Sendai was also known for its production of [[Tansu]], clothing drawers made from wood with elaborate ironwork.

The Sakunami area is also known for its natural environment, with [[cherry blossom]]s in the spring, and autumnal colours. The nearby Hōmei Shijuhachi Taki Falls is the name of waterfalls found in the higher reaches of the Hirose River. The origin of the name "Hōmei" (鳳鳴, "[[Fenghuang|Chinese phoenix]] cry") is said to come from ancient local inhabitants' claim that the sound of the waterfalls was similar to the legendary bird's call.

===Catholicism===
The Catholic Church has been associated with Sendai since 1613, the year in which [[Date Masamune]], ''daimyō'' of Sendai, built a galleon to send an [[Japanese warship San Juan Bautista|embassy to the Pope in Rome]] headed by [[Hasekura Tsunenaga]].<ref>Charles Ralph Boxer, The Christian Century in Japan, 1549–1650, (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1967), p.314</ref> Although the embassy was successful in its aim of establishing relations with the Holy See, Masamune's plans were frustrated by the suppression of Christianity in Japan. The [[Diocese of Sendai]] (previously the Diocese of Hakodate) was established in 1891, only two years after the promulgation of a new constitution guaranteeing freedom of religion in Japan, in 1889. The Bishop of Sendai currently oversees the four northern prefectures of Miyagi, Fukushima, Iwate and Aomori, serving 11,152 Catholics in 56 parishes. Mototerakoji, the Cathedral of the diocese, is located a few blocks north of Sendai Station.

Although the [[Chiba Lotte Marines|Lotte Orions]] briefly used Sendai as a temporary home for the franchise from 1973 to 1977, the city was largely ignored by professional sports until 1994.
