The [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]], involving the killings of hundreds of Indian civilians on the orders of British Colonel [[Reginald Dyer|Reginald Edward Harry Dyer]], took place on 13 April 1919 in the heart of Amritsar, the holiest city of the Sikhs, on a day sacred to them as the birth anniversary of the [[Khalsa]] (Vaisakhi day).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Collett |first1=Nigel |title=The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer |date=15 October 2006 |publisher=A&C Black |isbn=978-1-85285-575-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XuQC5pgzCw4C&pg=PA263 |language=en}}</ref>

In Punjab, during [[World War I]] (1914–18), there was considerable social unrest, particularly among the Sikhs. First, they opposed the demolition of a boundary wall of Gurdwara Rakab Ganj, a historic gurdwara near Parliament House in New Delhi. Later, they were disturbed about the activities and trials of the [[Ghadarite]]s, almost all of whom were Sikhs. In India as a whole, political activity had arisen during the strains of war. Two leaders had emerged: [[Mahatma Gandhi]] (1869–1948), who after a period of struggle as a young man against the British in [[South Africa]], and had returned to India in January 1915 to work there for change; and [[Annie Besant]] (1847–1933), head of the [[Theosophical Society of India]]. On 11 April 1916 she established the [[Indian Home Rule Movement|Home Rule League]] with the goal of autonomy for India.  In December 1916, the [[Indian National Congress]], at its annual session held at [[Lucknow]], passed a resolution asking the king to issue a proclamation announcing that it is the "aim and intention of British policy to confer self-government on India at an early date".<ref>''Proceedings of the Lucknow Session of the Indian National Congress, 1916,'' cited by {{cite book|last=Pasricha|first=Ashu|title=The Political Thought of Annie Besant (Encyclopaedia of Eminent Thinkers, Vol. 25)|year=2008|publisher=Concept Publishing|isbn=978-8180695858|page=84}}</ref>

On 10 April 1919, Satya Pal and Saifuddin Kitchlew, two popular proponents of the [[Satyagraha]] movement led by Gandhi, were called to the deputy commissioner's residence. There they were arrested and transported by car to Dharamsetla, a hill town, now in Himachal Pradesh. A general strike arose in response in Amritsar. Excited groups of citizens soon merged into a crowd of about 50,000 marching to protest these arrests to the deputy commissioner. The crowd, however, was stopped by British colonial forces and fired upon near the railway foot-bridge. The official version reported that the number of casualties were 12 dead and between 20 and 30 wounded. Based on evidence presented to an inquiry of the Indian National Congress, fatalities were reported as between 20 and 30.{{Cn|date=May 2023}}

Three days later, on 13 April, the traditional festival of Baisakhi, thousands of unarmed Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims gathered in the [[Jallianwala Bagh]]. An hour after the meeting began as scheduled at 16:30, Dyer arrived with a group of sixty-five Gurkha soldiers (from the [[9th Gorkha Rifles]]) and twenty-five Baluchi soldiers (from the [[59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force)|59th Scinde Rifles]]). Without warning the crowd to disperse, Dyer blocked the main exits from the Bagh and ordered his troops to begin shooting toward the densest sections of the crowd; the firing continued for approximately ten minutes. A British government inquiry into the massacre placed the death toll at 379.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche|title=The Jallianwala massacre – when British troops killed hundreds of unarmed Indians {{!}} DW {{!}} 13 April 2019|url=https://www.dw.com/en/the-jallianwala-massacre-when-british-troops-killed-hundreds-of-unarmed-indians/a-48313295|access-date=5 January 2021|website=DW.COM|language=en-GB|archive-date=8 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210108173914/https://www.dw.com/en/the-jallianwala-massacre-when-british-troops-killed-hundreds-of-unarmed-indians/a-48313295|url-status=live}}</ref> The Indian National Congress, on the other hand, estimated that approximately 1,000 people were killed.<ref name=":0" />
