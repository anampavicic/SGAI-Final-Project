== Etymology ==
Modern Dalian originated from '''Qingniwa''' ({{zh|t=青泥窪|s=青泥洼|p=Qīngníwā|l=[[Qing (color)|green/blue]] mud swamp|links=no|first=t}}) or [[Qingniwaqiao]] ({{zh|t=青泥窪橋|s=青泥洼桥|p=Qīngníwāqiáo|l= bridge over the green/blue mud swamp|labels=no|first=t}}), a small Chinese fishing village. The [[Russian Empire]] built a commercial town after coercing a lease of the area from the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1898 and called it '''Dalny''' ({{langx|ru|Дальний|translit= Dal'nij}} — "a remote one" or "far-away", in reference to the town's location,<ref name="shp">

rendered in Chinese as {{zh|t=達里尼|s=达里尼|p=Dálǐní|labels=no|first=t}}) from 1898 to 1905. After the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904–1905, Japan occupied the area as the [[Kwantung Leased Territory]] and renamed the city {{Nihongo|Dairen|大連/だいれん|lead= yes}}<ref name="shp"/> after the Chinese name for [[Dalian Bay]] ({{zh|t=大連灣|s=大连湾|hp=Dàlián Wān|links=no}}) — a name in use since at least 1879. English-language sources called the city '''Dairen''' in this period (1905–1945), from Japanese.

In 1950, Dalian, back in Chinese control, merged with the nearby town called [[Lüshun]] ({{zh|t=旅順|s=旅顺|links=no|first=t}}; formerly Ryojun and before that, Port Arthur) to form the city of '''Lüda'''<ref name="shp"/> ({{zh|c=旅大|hp=Lǚdà|labels=no|first=t}}), a name (formed from the first syllable of each constituent's name) which was usually rendered as '''Luta''' in English during that era. In 1981, the Chinese [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] again renamed the city from Lüda back to Dalian ({{zh|t=大連|s=大连|hp=Dàlián|labels=no|first=t}}), effective 5 March 1981.<ref name="shp"/>

==History==
===Ancient===
In the [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] and [[Han dynasty|Han]] periods (221 BC – AD 220), the Chinese state expanded its territories into northern [[Korea]] through the Dalian region, then under the jurisdiction of [[Liaodong]] county.<ref name="shp"/> During the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] era (3rd through 5th centuries), the Korean kingdom of [[Goguryeo]] controlled this region. In the early [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907), the Dalian region formed part of [[Andong]] Prefecture in Jili state; during the [[Liao dynasty]] (916–1125), it was a part of Dong Jing Tong Liaoyang county. Dalian was named Sanshan in the period of [[Cao Wei|Wei]] [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin]] (220–420), San Shanpu in the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907), Sanshan Seaport in the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644), and Qingniwakou during the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1911).

===Qing dynasty===
In the 1880s, Jinzhou, the north of downtown Dalian, now [[Jinzhou District]], was a walled town and a center for political intrigue and economic activity. The Qing government built bridges and heavily fortified the peninsula. Mining camps on the northern coast of [[Dalian Bay]] became the small town of Qingniwa ({{lang|zh-hans|青泥洼}}) or [[Qingniwaqiao]] ({{lang|zh-hans|青泥洼桥}}), near what became the downtown core of modern-day Dalian.

===British, Russian, and Japanese occupations===

The British briefly occupied Qingniwa during the [[Second Opium War]] in 1858,<ref>They also renamed the bay for [[Queen Victoria]]. Kuramoto p. 19.</ref> but returned it to Chinese  (Qing) control in 1860. Port Arthur at the tip of the Liaodong Peninsula took its English name from Royal Navy Lieutenant [[William Arthur (Royal Navy)|William Arthur]], though the area's Chinese name had always been [[Lüshun]]. Although China heavily fortified the area, in which it allowed trade with foreigners, in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] Japan swiftly overcame those defenses{{citation needed|date= January 2015}} on 21 November 1894 in the [[Battle of Lüshunkou]], committing the [[Port Arthur massacre (China)|Port Arthur massacre]] afterwards. In April 1895 China conceded defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War, ceding [[Liaodong Peninsula]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Penghu]], and making many other concessions in the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] (17 April 1895).

In the [[Triple Intervention]] of 23 April 1895, Russia, France and Germany forced Japan to return the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] to China, despite the treaty's terms; instead the [[Russian Empire]] coerced a lease of the peninsula from the Qing dynasty in 1898. Russia had a particular interest in the region of the peninsula as one of the few areas in the region that had the potential to develop [[Port#Warm-water port|ice-free ports]].<ref>Hess, Christian A. (2006). "From colonial jewel to socialist metropolis: Dalian, 1895–1955." PhD dissertation (University of California, San Diego), p. 17.</ref> The Russians built a modern commercial port city, which they wanted to become the Paris of the Far East, and called it Dal'niy ({{langx|ru|Дальний|links=no}}).<ref>Kuramoto p. 20.</ref> Linked by 1902 with the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] via the branch line [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] through [[Harbin]], Dal'niy became Russia's primary port-city in Asia while also serving Western traders. Russia signed the [[Pavlov Agreement (1898)]] with China, which granted Russia a 25-year lease on Dalian and Lüshun and exclusive right to build a branch of the Chinese Eastern Railway—what would become from 1905 the Japanese-operated [[South Manchurian Railway]].<ref>Hess, p. 21.</ref> Russia spent more than 10 million golden rubles (equivalent to 11.5 billion of today's [[rubles]]) building the new ice-free port city.<ref>March, G. Patrick. ''Eastern Destiny: Russia in Asia and the North Pacific'' (Santa Barbara, CA: Praeger, 1996)</ref>

Russia heavily fortified both Dalniy (Qingniwaqiao of Zhongshan District) and the Port Arthur naval base (Lüshunkou) before and after the [[Boxer Rebellion]] of 1899–1901. During the insurrection, missionaries and converts were killed by rebels in the peninsula, although the massive massacres of ethnic Chinese Christians including [[Metrophanes, Chi Sung]] occurred at [[Harbin]].<ref name="Orthodox.cn">{{cite web|url= http://www.orthodox.cn/history/martyrs/1_en.htm|title= Accounts of the Martyrs of the Chinese Orthodox Church who fell victim in Beijing in 1900|publisher=Nina Tkachuk Dimas|access-date=14 September 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110927141141/http://www.orthodox.cn/history/martyrs/1_en.htm |archive-date=27 September 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Western expeditionary forces suppressed the [[Boxers (group)|Boxers]] across the Yellow Sea in [[Shandong]].

During the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904–1905, the Liaodong Peninsula became a major battleground. Major-General Baron [[Anatoly Stoessel]] defended a [[siege of Port Arthur|besieged Port Arthur]], for five months (August 1904 to January 1905), but the Japanese army, using long-distance fire, sank several Russian ships at the Port Arthur naval base in early December 1904.

After the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] crippled the remaining Russian battleship ''[[Russian battleship Sevastopol (1895)|Sevastopol]]'' in three weeks of constant attacks, and explosives detonated in tunnels destroyed Port Arthur's remaining defenses in the final days of 1904, Russia negotiated a ceasefire and surrendered Port Arthur in January 1905.<ref>

The [[Treaty of Portsmouth]] (signed 5 September 1905) ceded Port Arthur to Japan, which set up the [[Kwantung Leased Territory]] or {{lang|zh-Latn|Guandongzhou}} ({{lang|zh-hant|關東州}}), on roughly the southern half (Jinzhou District and south) of present-day Dalian. Japanese invested heavily in the region, which became the main trading port between [[Manchuria]] and Japan. Japan leased the area from [[Manchukuo]] after establishing that puppet state in 1932. In 1937, as the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] began, Japan enlarged and modernized the trade zone as two cities: the northern Dairen (Dalian) and the southern Ryojun (Lüshun or Port Arthur).

===Post-World War II===

With the unconditional [[surrender of Japan]] in August–September 1945, Dairen passed to the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]], whose [[Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation]] had liberated the city on 22 August 1945. The Soviets and [[Chinese Communists]] cooperated to develop the city, relatively undamaged during the war,<ref name="shp"/> especially its industrial infrastructure and the port. The Soviet government rented the port and in 1945 the first Chinese Communist mayor of the new Lüda Administrative Office ({{zh|s=旅大行政公署|labels=no}}) was appointed.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

In 1950 the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] presented the city to the Chinese Communist government without any compensation. Dalian and [[Lüshun]] (former Port Arthur) merged as Lüda on 1 December 1950. From 12 March 1953 to 1 August 1954 it was a [[Direct-controlled municipality of the People's Republic of China|direct-controlled municipality]] and not part of Liaoning. Soviet troops left the city in 1955.<ref name="shp"/> After the Soviets left, the PRC made Lüda a major shipbuilding center.

In 1981 the city was renamed Dalian, with [[Lüshunkou]] becoming a constituent district.<ref name="shp"/> In 1984 the Chinese Government designated the city a [[Special Economic Zones of the People's Republic of China|Special Economic Zone]]. At the time, Dalian was China's largest foreign-trade port.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VSozAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RO8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1332,976704&dq=dalian+economic-zone&hl=en "China widens doors for foreign capital"] {{Webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151222155148/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VSozAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RO8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1332,976704&dq=dalian+economic-zone&hl=en |date=22 December 2015 }}.

=== 1990 to present ===
The city was upgraded from a [[prefecture-level city]] to a [[sub-provincial city]] in May 1994, with no change in its administrative subdivisions. In the 1990s the city benefited from the attention of [[Bo Xilai]] (later Party secretary of [[Chongqing]]). Bo served both as the mayor of the city and as one of the major leaders in the province; among other things, he banned motorcycles and planted large, lush parks in the city's many traffic circles. He also preserved much of Dalian's [[Japanese architecture|Japanese]] and [[Russian architecture|Russian]] architectural heritage. He also worked as the former [[Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China|Minister of Commerce]] of China.

Since 2007 Dalian has hosted the [[World Economic Forum#Summer annual meeting|Annual Meeting of the New Champions]] ("Summer Davos"), organized by the [[World Economic Forum]], in alternating years with [[Tianjin]].<ref>{{cite web |title=World Economic Forum: The Inaugural Annual Meeting of the New Champions |url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/business/222969.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923232350/http://www.china.org.cn/english/business/222969.htm |archive-date=23 September 2015 |access-date=29 August 2008 |publisher=China.org}}</ref> The venue for the forum is the Dalian International Conference Center in Donggang CBD.

In 2010 [[Xingang Port oil spill|one of the worst recorded oil-spills in China's history]] occurred in Dalian. The [[Dalian PX protest]] occurred on 14 August 2011. In June 2014, China's tenth [[New areas#State-level new areas|state-level new area]], the Dalian Jinpu New Area was officially established. On 5 August 2016, the Dalian [[huabiao]] incident occurred. A huabiao in the center of [[Xinghai Square]] was demolished, which was believed to be out of political reasons related to the [[Bo Xilai#Downfall|downfall]] of Chinese politician [[Bo Xilai]], who oversaw the construction of Xinghai Square and the central huabiao during his tenure as the mayor of Dalian. The site of the huabiao was later replaced with a musical fountain, the largest one in [[Northeast China]].

[[File:Dalian, China, satellite image, LandSat-5, 2010-08-03.jpg|thumb|right|Dalian and vicinities, [[Landsat 5]] satellite image, 3 August 2010]]
One of the most heavily developed industrial areas of China, Dalian municipal area today consists of Dalian proper and the smaller [[Lüshunkou]] (formerly Lüshun city, known in Western and Russian historic references as Port Arthur), about {{convert|40|nmi|km mi|spell=in|lk=in|abbr=off|sp=us}} farther along the [[Liaodong Peninsula]]. Historical references note that the Russian designed city of Dalniy (Alt. Dalney), on the south side of [[Dalian Bay]] was {{convert|40|km|abbr=off|sp=us}} from Port Arthur/Lüshun (known today as Lüshunkou or literally, Lüshun Port).

Dalian is located on [[Korea Bay]] north of the [[Yellow Sea]] and roughly in the middle of the Liaodong peninsula at its narrowest neck or [[isthmus]]. With a coastline of {{convert|1906|km|abbr=on}}, it governs the majority of the Liaodong Peninsula and about 260 surrounding islands and reefs. It is seated at south-south-west of the [[Yalu River]], and its harbor entrance forms a sub-bay known as [[Dalian Bay]].

===Climate===
Dalian has a [[monsoon]]-influenced [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dwa''), characterized by warm wet summers due to the [[East Asian monsoon]], and cold, windy, dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast [[Siberian anticyclone]]. Except for winter, the city experiences a one-month seasonal lag due to its position on the Liaodong Peninsula. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from {{convert|−3.3|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|24.8|°C|1}} in August. Annual precipitation averages {{convert|580|mm|1|sp=us}} but is heavily concentrated in the summer months and can vary greatly from year to year. Due to the coastal location, the mean [[diurnal temperature variation]] annually is small, at {{convert|6.66|C-change|1}}. The monthly percent of possible sunshine ranges from 45% in July to 66% in March, with 2,625 hours of bright sunshine annually. The annual mean temperature is {{convert|11.6|°C|1}}. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from {{convert|−21.1|°C|0}} on 4 January 1970 to {{convert|36.6|°C|0}} on 14 July 2015.<ref name=CMA/>

[[Dalian dialect]] belongs to the [[Jiaoliao Mandarin]] subgroup spoken in parts of [[Shandong]] and [[Liaoning]] provinces, which is a separate branch from [[Northeastern Mandarin]]. Most of the residents of Dalian were farmers and fishermen who had come from Shandong Province in a large population move, the ''[[Chuang Guandong]]'', during which era Dalian was occupied by the Japanese as the [[Kwantung Leased Territory]]. Dalian dialect incorporates a few [[loanword]]s from [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] (very rare in Chinese), reflecting the history of foreign occupation.<ref>Mikami, Yoshi (27 June 2002): [http://www.logos3.net/china/dalianhuacn.html The Dalian Dialect] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117032720/http://www.logos3.net/china/dalianhuacn.html |date=17 November 2015 }} (in Chinese)</ref> Dalian dialect is mostly distinguishable from [[Standard Mandarin]] based on a low-falling Yinping {{lang|zh-Hans|阴平}} (31) and rich [[tone sandhi]], and it is often referred to as being "oyster flavored" ({{lang|zh-hans|海蛎子味}}) by the locals.<ref>{{cite web |author1=掌上辽宁 |title=潜伏在东北话中的"海蛎子味儿" |url=https://www.sohu.com/a/61881411_217139 |website=sohu.com |access-date=11 August 2020 |language=zh |date=4 March 2016}}</ref>
