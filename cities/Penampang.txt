== Etymology ==
The name ''Penampang'' came from an old village within the district. The village's name in turn originates from a [[Kadazan language|Kadazan word]] ''pampang'' meaning a big rock. This is because huge rocks were easily found within the vicinity of the village a long time ago. The name in contemporary usage refers to the district, with the town of ''Donggongon'' as the main town within the district of Penampang. The name Donggongon originates from Kadazan word ''tundo'ongon'' which means a 'shelter' or a 'resting area', referring to its historical role as a stop-over for people from the interior who journeyed down the coast to trade. Penampang as a name reference of this area is of a relatively new origin. Early British explorer, [[John Whitehead (explorer)|John Whitehead]] who had explored [[North Borneo]] in the 1880s referred to this district as ''Patatan''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Whitehead|first1=John|title=Exploration of Mount Kina Balu, North Borneo|date=1893|publisher=London: Gurney and Jackson|page=25|url=http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=sea;cc=sea;idno=sea280;view=toc}}</ref> [[Owen Rutter]], a civil servant in North Borneo from 1910 to 1914 similarly referred to this area as ''Putatan''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rutter|first1=Owen|title=British North Borneo: An Account of Its History, Resources and Native Tribes|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924023151933|date=1922|publisher=Constable & Company Limited, London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/cu31924023151933/page/n48 21], 135, 339}}</ref>
