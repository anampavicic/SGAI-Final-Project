==History==
{{main|History of Otago}}
Like the rest of mainland New Zealand, Otago was first settled by the [[Māori people]]. The Otago settlement, an outgrowth of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]], was founded in March 1848 with the arrival of the first two immigrant ships from [[Greenock]] on the [[Firth of Clyde]] — the ''[[John Wickliffe (ship)|John Wickliffe]]'' and the ''Philip Laing''. Captain [[William Cargill (New Zealand politician)|William Cargill]], a veteran of the [[Peninsular War]], was the secular leader. Otago citizens subsequently elected him to the office of provincial Superintendent after the [[Provinces of New Zealand|New Zealand provinces]] were created in 1853.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=McKinnon |first1=Malcolm |title=Otago region – The Otago settlement |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/page-5 |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |access-date=16 April 2020 |language=en-NZ |date=1 May 2015 |archive-date=15 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240515075123/https://teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/page-5 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Otago Province]] was the whole of New Zealand from the [[Waitaki River]] south, including Stewart Island and the sub-Antarctic islands. It included the territory of the later [[Southland Province]] and also the much more extensive lands of the modern [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland Region]].
[[File:Arrowtown (4678481119).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Arrowtown]], a historic mining town]]
Initial settlement was concentrated on the port and city, then expanded, notably to the south-west, where the fertile [[Taieri Plains]] offered good farmland.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=McKinnon |first1=Malcolm |title=Otago region – Wool and farming |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/page-6 |encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |access-date=16 April 2020 |language=en-NZ |date=1 May 2015 |archive-date=1 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181201135246/https://teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/page-6 |url-status=live }}</ref> The 1860s saw rapid commercial expansion after [[Gabriel Read]] discovered gold at [[Gabriel's Gully]] near [[Lawrence, New Zealand|Lawrence]], and the [[Otago gold rush]] ensued.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=McKinnon |first1=Malcolm |title=Otago region – Gold and development |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/page-7 |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |access-date=16 April 2020 |language=en-NZ |date=1 May 2015 |archive-date=30 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130155123/https://teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/page-7 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Veterans of goldfields in California and Australia, plus many other fortune-seekers from Europe, North America and China, poured into the then Province of Otago, eroding its Scottish [[Presbyterian]] character. Further gold discoveries at [[Clyde, New Zealand|Clyde]] and on the Arrow River around [[Arrowtown]] led to a boom, and Otago became for a period the cultural and economic centre of New Zealand. New Zealand's first daily newspaper, the ''[[Otago Daily Times]]'', originally edited by [[Julius Vogel]], dates from this period.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=McKinnon |first1=Malcolm |title=Otago region – Art, writing and music |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/page-14 |encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |access-date=16 April 2020 |language=en-NZ |date=1 May 2015 |archive-date=15 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240515075203/https://teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/page-14 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Image:University of Otago.jpg|thumb|The [[University of Otago]], New Zealand's oldest university]]
New Zealand's first university, the [[University of Otago]], was founded in 1869 as the provincial university in Dunedin.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the University of Otago |url=https://www.otago.ac.nz/about/history/index.html |website=www.otago.ac.nz |date=7 August 2019 |publisher=University of Otago |access-date=16 April 2020 |language=en-nz |archive-date=15 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240515075120/https://www.otago.ac.nz/about/history |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Province of Southland separated from Otago Province and set up its own Provincial Council at [[Invercargill]] in 1861. After difficulties ensued, Otago re-absorbed it in 1870. Its territory is included in the southern region of the old Otago Province which is named after it and is now the territory of the Southland region. The provincial governments were abolished in 1876 when the Abolition of the Provinces Act came into force on 1 November 1876,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://rulers.org/newzprov.html |title=New Zealand Provinces 1848–77 |access-date=10 December 2010 |archive-date=29 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429031451/http://www.rulers.org/newzprov.html |url-status=live }}</ref> and were replaced by other forms of local authority, including counties. Two in Otago were named after the Scottish independence heroes [[William Wallace|Wallace]] and [[Robert I of Scotland|Bruce]]. From this time the national limelight gradually shifted northwards.

Otago's flag was chosen from a 2004 competition. It was designed by Gregor Macauly.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/picks-underwhelming-otago-flag-designer-says |title=Picks 'underwhelming', Otago flag designer says |website=www.odt.co.nz |publisher=Otago Daily Times |first=Carla |last=Green |date=2 September 2015 |access-date= 5 February 2023}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Autumn in Otago, New Zealand.jpg|thumb|Autumn 2004 in Otago]]
[[File:Beaumont, New Zealand aerial photo 2006.jpg|thumb|Aerial photo of [[Beaumont, New Zealand|Beaumont]] area in Otago, looking southwest. [[State Highway 8 (New Zealand)|State Highway 8]] runs from left to right across the photo (only visible in the right half), and crosses the [[Clutha River]] just below centre.]]
[[File:Mount Aspiring, Otago, New Zealand, 22 July 2005.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Aspiring / Tititea]] is New Zealand's highest mountain outside the [[Aoraki / Mount Cook]] region.]]
Beginning in the west, the geography of Otago consists of high alpine mountains. The highest peak in Otago (and highest outside the [[Aoraki / Mount Cook]] area) is [[Mount Aspiring / Tititea]],<ref name="landscape">{{cite encyclopedia |last1=McKinnon |first1=Malcolm |title=Otago region – Geology and landscape |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/page-2 |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |access-date=16 April 2020 |language=en-NZ |date=1 May 2015 |archive-date=15 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240515075139/https://teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/page-2 |url-status=live }}</ref> which is on the [[Main Divide]]. From the high mountains the rivers discharge into large glacial lakes. In this part of Otago [[glacial]] activity – both recent and very old – dominates the landscape, with large U-shaped valleys and rivers which have high sediment loads. River flows also vary dramatically, with large flood flows occurring after heavy rain. Lakes [[Lake Wakatipu|Wakatipu]], [[Lake Wānaka|Wānaka]], and [[Lake Hāwea|Hāwea]] form the sources of the Clutha / Matau-au, the largest river (by discharge) in New Zealand. The Clutha flows generally to the southeast through Otago and discharges near [[Balclutha, New Zealand|Balclutha]]. The river has been used for [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] generation, with large dams at [[Clyde, New Zealand|Clyde]] and [[Roxburgh, New Zealand|Roxburgh]]. The traditional northern boundary of the region, the [[Waitaki River]], is also heavily utilised for hydroelectricity, though the region's current official boundaries put much of that river's catchment in [[Canterbury Region|Canterbury]].

[[File:Kawarau Gorge and Roaring Meg.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kawarau Gorge]], where [[Roaring Meg hydro scheme|Roaring Meg]] joins the [[Kawarau River]], in central Otago]]
The country's fourth-longest river, the [[Taieri River|Taieri]], also has both its source and outflow in Otago, rising from rough hill country and following a broad horseshoe-shaped path, north, then east, and finally southeast, before reaching the Pacific Ocean. Along its course it forms two notable geographic features – the broad high valley of the [[Strath-Taieri]] in its upper reaches, and the fertile [[Taieri Plains]] as it approaches the ocean.

Travelling east from the mountains, the [[Central Otago]] drylands predominate. These are [[Canterbury-Otago tussock grasslands]] dominated by the block mountains, upthrust [[schist]] mountains. In contrast to Canterbury, where the Northwest winds blow across the plains without interruption, in Otago the block mountains impede and dilute the effects of the [[Nor'west arch|Nor'wester]].

The main Central Otago centres, such as [[Alexandra, New Zealand|Alexandra]] and [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]], are found in the intermontane basins between the block mountains. The schist bedrock influence extends to the eastern part of Otago, where remnant volcanics mark its edge. The remains of the most spectacular of these are the Miocene volcanics centred on [[Otago Harbour]]. Elsewhere, basalt outcrops can be found along the coast and at other sites.

Comparatively similar terrain exists in the high plateau land of the [[Maniototo Plain]], which lies to the east of Central Otago, close to the upper reaches of the Taieri River. This area is sparsely populated, but of historical note for its importance during the [[Otago gold rush]] of the 1860s. The townships of [[Ranfurly, New Zealand|Ranfurly]] and [[Naseby, New Zealand|Naseby]] lie in this area.

In the southeastern corner of Otago lies [[The Catlins]],<ref name="landscape"/> an area of rough hill country which geologically forms part of the Murihiku [[terrane]], an accretion which extends inland through the [[Hokonui Hills]] in the [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]] region. This itself forms part of a larger system known as the Southland [[Syncline]], which links to similar formations in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] (offset by the [[Alpine Fault]]) and even in [[New Caledonia]], {{cvt|3500|km|mi}} away.<ref name="Heads1989">Heads, Michael (1989). [https://books.google.com/books?id=mypPBKZTdKEC&pg=PA572 Integrating earth and life sciences in New Zealand natural history: the parallel arcs model], ''New Zealand Journal of Zoology'' 16, pp. 549–585.</ref>

The Catlins ranges are [[strike ridge]]s composed of [[Triassic]] and [[Jurassic]] [[sandstone]]s, [[mudstone]]s and other related sedimentary rocks, often with a high incidence of [[feldspar]]. Fossils of the late and middle Triassic [[New Zealand geologic time scale|Warepan and Kaihikuan]] stages are found in the area.

==Climate==
Weather conditions vary enormously across Otago, but can be broken into two broad types: the coastal climate of the coastal regions and the more continental climate of the interior.<ref name="climate">{{cite encyclopedia |last1=McKinnon |first1=Malcolm |title=Otago region – Climate, plants and animals |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/page-3 |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |access-date=16 April 2020 |language=en-NZ |date=1 May 2015 |archive-date=12 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200812220246/https://teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/page-3 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Coastal regions of Otago are subject to the alternating warm and dry/cool and wet weather patterns common to the interannual [[Southern oscillation]]. The Southern Hemisphere storm track produces an irregular short cycle of weather which repeats roughly every week, with three or four days of fine weather followed by three or four days of cooler, damp conditions. Drier conditions are often the result of the [[Nor'west arch|northwesterly]] [[föhn]] wind, which dries as it crosses the [[Southern Alps]]. Wetter air is the result of approaching low-pressure systems which sweep fronts over the country from the southwest. A common variant in this pattern is the centring of a stationary low-pressure zone to the southeast of the country, resulting in long-lasting cool, wet conditions. These have been responsible for several notable historical floods, such as the "hundred year floods" of October 1878 and October 1978.

Typically, winters are cool and wet in the extreme south areas and snow can fall and settle to sea level in winter, especially in the hills and plains of [[South Otago]]. More Central and Northern Coastal areas winter is sunnier and drier. Summers, by contrast, tend to be warm and dry, with temperatures often reaching the high 20s and low 30s Celsius.

In [[Central Otago]] cold frosty winters are succeeded by hot dry summers. Central Otago's climate is the closest approximation to a continental climate anywhere in New Zealand. This climate is part of the reason why [[Central Otago wines|Central Otago vineyards]] are successful in this region. This inland region is one of the driest regions in the country, sheltered from prevailing rain-bearing weather conditions by the high mountains to the west and hills of the south. Summers can be hot, with temperatures often approaching or exceeding 30 degrees Celsius; winters, by contrast, are often bitterly cold – the township of [[Ranfurly, New Zealand|Ranfurly]] in Central Otago holds the New Zealand record for lowest temperature with a reading of −25.6&nbsp;°C on 18 July 1903.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Brenstrum |first1=Erick |title=Broken record |url=https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/broken-record/ |access-date=16 April 2020 |work=[[New Zealand Geographic]] |issue=137 |date=2016 |language=en-NZ |archive-date=11 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200811005842/https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/broken-record/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

For historical and geographical reasons, Dunedin is usually regarded as one of New Zealand's four main centres. Unlike other southern centres, Dunedin's population has not declined since the 1970s, largely due to the presence of the [[University of Otago]] – and especially its [[University of Otago Dunedin School of Medicine|medical school]] – which attracts students from all over New Zealand and overseas.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/11 |title=Otago region: Population and employment since 1920 |last=Mckinnon |first=Malcolm |date=17 August 2009 |encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |access-date=18 February 2010 |archive-date=21 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021041339/http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/11 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Politics==
===Local government===
The seat of the Otago Regional Council is in Dunedin. The council is chaired by Andrew Noone {{as of|2021|July|lc=on}}.

There are five [[territorial authorities of New Zealand|territorial authorities]] in Otago:
* [[Queenstown-Lakes District]]
* [[Central Otago District]]
* [[Dunedin|Dunedin City]]
* [[Clutha District]]
* [[Waitaki, New Zealand|Waitaki District]]

===Parliamentary representation===
Otago is represented by four [[New Zealand Parliament|parliamentary]] [[New Zealand electorates|electorates]]. Dunedin and nearby towns are represented by the [[Dunedin (New Zealand electorate)|Dunedin]] electorate, held by [[Rachel Brooking]], and the [[Taieri (New Zealand electorate)|Taieri]] electorate, occupied by [[Ingrid Leary]]. Both MPs are members of the Labour Party, and Dunedin has traditionally been a Labour stronghold. Since 2008 the rest of Otago has been divided between the large rural electorates of [[Waitaki (New Zealand electorate)|Waitaki]], which also includes some of the neighbouring [[Canterbury Region]], and [[Clutha-Southland]], which also includes most of the rural part of the neighbouring Southland Region. The Waitaki electorate has traditionally been a [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] stronghold and is currently held by [[Miles Anderson (politician)|Miles Anderson]]. The [[Southland (New Zealand electorate)|Southland]] electorate, also a National Party stronghold, is currently represented by [[Joseph Mooney (New Zealand politician)|Joseph Mooney]]. The earlier [[Otago (New Zealand electorate)|Otago electorate]] existed from 1978 to 2008, when it was split and merged into Waitaki and Clutha-Southland.

Two [[Party-list proportional representation|list MPs]] are based in Dunedin – [[Michael Woodhouse]] of the National Party and [[Rachel Brooking]] of the Labour Party. One-time Labour Party Deputy Leader [[David Parker (New Zealand politician)|David Parker]] is a former MP for the Otago electorate and currently a list MP.

Under the [[Māori electorates]] system, Otago is also part of the large [[Te Tai Tonga (New Zealand electorate)|Te Tai Tonga]] electorate, which covers the entire South Island and surrounding islands, and is currently held by Te Pāti Māori Party MP [[Tākuta Ferris]].

=== Ngāi Tahu governance ===
Three of the 18 [[Ngāi Tahu]] [[Rūnanga]] (councils) are based in the Otago Region. Each one is centred on a coastal marae, namely [[Otakou|Ōtākou]], [[Moeraki]] and Puketeraki at [[Karitane]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ngaitahu.iwi.nz/te-runanga-o-ngai-tahu/papatipu-runanga/ |title=Papatipu Rūnanga |website=Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu |language=en-NZ |access-date=30 January 2019 |archive-date=11 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180911081636/https://ngaitahu.iwi.nz/te-runanga-o-ngai-tahu/papatipu-runanga/ |url-status=live }}</ref> There is also the Arai Te Uru Marae in Dunedin.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.araiteuru.co.nz/ |title=Arai Te Uru Whare Hauora |website=Arai Te Uru Whare Hauora |language=en-NZ |access-date=30 January 2019 |archive-date=30 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190130162942/http://www.araiteuru.co.nz/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Economy==
The subnational gross domestic product (GDP) of Otago was estimated at NZ$14.18 billion<ref>{{Cite web |title=Regional gross domestic product: Year ended March 2020 {{!}} Stats NZ |url=https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/regional-gross-domestic-product-year-ended-march-2020 |access-date=27 May 2021 |website=www.stats.govt.nz |archive-date=29 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429114110/http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/economic_indicators/NationalAccounts/rgdp-YeMar16-infographic.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref> in the year to March 2020, 4.38% of New Zealand's national GDP. The regional GDP per capita was estimated at $58,353 in the same period. In the year to March 2018, primary industries contributed $1.25 billion (9.8%) to the regional GDP, goods-producing industries contributed $2.38 billion (18.6%), service industries contributed $8.05 billion (63.0%), and taxes and duties contributed $1.10 billion (8.6%).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Regional gross domestic product: Year ended March 2019 {{!}} Stats NZ |url=https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/regional-gross-domestic-product-year-ended-march-2019 |website=www.stats.govt.nz |access-date=21 May 2020}}</ref>

Otago has a mixed economy. Dunedin is home to manufacturing, publishing and technology-based industries. Rural economies have been reinvigorated in the 1990s and 2000s: in Clutha district, farms have been converted from sheep to more lucrative dairying. Vineyard planting and production remained modest until the middle of the 1990s when the [[New Zealand wine]] industry began to expand rapidly. The [[Central Otago wine region]] produces wine made from varieties such as the [[Pinot noir]], [[Chardonnay]], [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[Merlot]] and [[Riesling]] grapes. It has an increasing reputation as New Zealand's leading Pinot noir region.<ref>{{cite web |title=Central Otago wine success at home and abroad |date=11 November 2006 |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/AK0611/S00117.htm |access-date=9 October 2007}}</ref>

==Education==

Otago has numerous rural primary schools, several small town primary and secondary schools, and some larger schools in [[Dunedin]]. Most are state schools which do not charge tuition, except for international students.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nzplc.massey.ac.nz/default.asp?page=docs/board/schoolfee.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714010803/http://nzplc.massey.ac.nz/default.asp?page=docs%2Fboard%2Fschoolfee.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 July 2006 |title=School Donations & Fees |publisher=[[New Zealand Ministry of Education]] |date=23 June 1998 |access-date=23 June 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edusearch.co.nz/content/nzschoolsystem.php |title=about NZ education |publisher=EduSearch |access-date=8 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206071452/http://www.edusearch.co.nz/content/nzschoolsystem.php |archive-date=6 December 2007}}</ref> Some are state integrated schools, former private schools with a special character based on a religious or philosophical belief that has been integrated into the state system, but still charge "attendance dues" to cover the building and maintenance of school buildings. These schools are not owned by the government, but otherwise they like state schools cannot charge fees for tuition of domestic students but may request a donation. As Dunedin was founded by [[Presbyterian]] Scottish settlers there are a Presbyterian girls' and boys' school in the city. Unlike other major cities in New Zealand, Dunedin does not have any private intermediate or high schools, as all remaining private intermediate and high schools have been integrated into the state system.
