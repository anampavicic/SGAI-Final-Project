== Etymology ==
The city was known as ''Chicacole'' before [[Indian Independence Day|Indian Independence]].<ref name="intro">{{cite web|url=http://cdma.ap.gov.in/SRIKAKULAM/index.html|title=Srikakulam Municipality|website=Commissioner & Director of Municipal Administration|publisher=Municipal Administration and Urban Development Department, Govt. of Andhra Pradesh|access-date=16 February 2015}}</ref>

== History ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2020}}
Srikakulam or Chicacole is of great historical significance in the medieval and later history of Kalinga. The earliest history of Srikakulam dates back to the ages of the Eastern Ganga Dynasty. It falls under the direct rule of the Suryavanshis of Nandapur until its annexation by the Golconda Qutb Shahis. Under the Sultans of Golconda, Srikakulam became the headquarters of the North Andhra region and one officer called 'Fouzdar' was appointed to look after the administration. The rule of Golconda in the region ended in 1673 with a battle between the king of Jeypore, Viswambhar Dev-I and the Nawab of Chicacole.

Due to the weakening state of Golconda, the fouzdar of Chicacole adopted the title of Nawab and endeavored to establish an independent regime. However, he was defeated by Viswambhar Dev-I, who re-established the rule of Jeypore in the North Andhra regions.
