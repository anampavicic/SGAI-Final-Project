==History==
===Ancient and medieval history===
Human settlements on the river Neretva, between [[Mount Hum (Mostar)|Mount Hum]] and the [[Velež Mountain]], have existed since prehistory, as witnessed by discoveries of fortified enceintes and cemeteries. Evidence of [[Roman people|Roman]] occupation was discovered beneath the present town.<ref name="whc.unesco.org">{{Cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/946/ |title=UNESCO: Old Bridge Area of the Old City of Mostar |access-date=2019-12-26 |archive-date=2020-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200109150400/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/946/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

As far as medieval Mostar goes, although the Christian basilicas of late antiquity remained in use, few historical sources were preserved and not much is known about this period. The name of Mostar was first mentioned in a document dating from 1474, taking its name from the bridge-keepers (''mostari''); this refers to the existence of a wooden bridge from the market on the left bank of the river which was used by traders, soldiers, and other travelers. During this time it was also the seat of a [[kadiluk]] (district with a regional judge). Since Mostar was on the trade route between the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and the mineral-rich regions of [[central Bosnia]], the settlement began to spread to the right bank of the river.<ref name="whc.unesco.org"/>

Prior to 1474 the names of two towns appear in medieval historical sources, along with their later medieval territories and properties – the towns of Nebojša and Cimski grad. In the early 15th century the county (''[[župa]]'') of Večenike covered the site of the present-day Mostar along the right bank of the Neretva, including the sites of Zahum, [[Cim (archaeological site)|Cim]], [[Ilići]], [[Raštani, Mostar|Raštani]] and [[Vojno]]. It was at the center of this area, which in 1408 belonged to [[Juraj Radivojević|Radivojević]], who built Cim Fort (prior to 1443). Mostar is indirectly referred to in a 1454 charter of King [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] as ''Pons'' ("bridge"), for a bridge had already been built there. Prior to 1444, the Nebojša Tower was built on the left bank of the Neretva, which belonged to the late medieval county still known as Večenike or Večerić.<ref>Anđelić, 1974, 276–278</ref> The earliest documentary reference to Mostar as a settlement dates from 3 April 1452, when [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusans]] from [[Dubrovnik]] wrote to their fellow countrymen in the service of Serbian Despot [[Đorđe Branković]] to say that [[Vladislav Hercegović]] had turned against his father [[Stjepan Vukčić Kosača|Stjepan]] and occupied the town of [[Blagaj, Mostar|Blagaj]] and other places, including ''“Duo Castelli al ponte de Neretua.”''.<ref name="Mujezinović, 1998, p. 144">Mujezinović, 1998, p.&nbsp;144</ref>

===Ottoman period===

[[File:Cskt-tavasz mosztarban (1903).jpg|thumb|Springtime in Mostar by [[Tivadar Kosztka Csontváry]] (1853–1919)]]

In 1468 the region came under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]]<ref name="Mujezinović, 1998, p. 144"/> and the [[urbanization]] of the settlement began. It was named ''Köprühisar'', meaning fortress at the bridge, at the centre of which was a cluster of 15 houses. The town was organized into two distinct areas: ''[[čaršija]]'', the crafts and commercial centre of the settlement, and ''[[mahala]]'' or a residential area.<ref>Institute for Regional Planning, Mostar, 1982, p.&nbsp;21</ref>

The town was fortified between the years 1520 and 1566, and the wooden bridge rebuilt in stone.<ref name="whc.unesco.org"/> In 1519 ([[Hijri year|Hijri]] 925) the settlement was recorded as a castle and both as Mostar and as Köprühisar and it was inhabited by Muslims and Christians. It had four Muslim households and 85 Christian households.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=GÖKBİLGİN |first=M.

Later becoming the city's symbol, the Old Bridge was designed by [[Mimar Hayruddin]],<ref name=Stratton/> a student and apprentice of Ottoman architect [[Mimar Sinan]]. In the late 16th century, Köprühisar was one of the towns of the [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]]. In the 17th century, Turkish traveler and author [[Evliya Çelebi]] wrote of the bridge thus:
{{blockquote|the bridge is like a rainbow arch soaring up to the skies, extending from one cliff to the other... I, a poor and miserable servant of Allah, have passed through 16 countries, but I have never seen such a high bridge. It is thrown from rock to rock as high as the sky.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199805/hearts.and.stones.htm |title=Hearts and Stones |publisher=Saudi Aramco World |access-date=2013-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004214954/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199805/hearts.and.stones.htm |archive-date=2012-10-04 |url-status=dead}}</ref>}}

The first church in the city of Mostar, a [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], was built in 1834 during Ottoman rule.<ref name="Villa Menalo 1992">{{cite web |title=Mostar |website=Villa Menalo |date=1992-04-03 |url=http://www.villa-menalo.com/mostar-210.html |access-date=2021-06-17 |archive-date=2021-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624201056/http://www.villa-menalo.com/mostar-210.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Austrian and Yugoslav period===
{{stack|float=left|[[File:Mostar-1900.jpg|thumb|left|People of Mostar in 1890–1900]] [[File:Stjepan Radic in Mostar, 1925.jpg|thumb|left|People gathered waiting for [[Stjepan Radić]] to arrive in Mostar in 1925]]}}

[[Austria-Hungary]] took [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|control over Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1878 and ruled the region until the [[aftermath of World War I]] in 1918, when it became part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] and then [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. During this period, Mostar was the main urban centre of [[Herzegovina]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Taking Vengeance on the Serbs |url=https://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/n54/mode/1up |newspaper=The Independent |date=July 13, 1914 |access-date=August 12, 2012}}</ref> 
In 1881, the town became the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mostar-Duvno]] and, in 1939, it became a part of the [[Banovina of Croatia]]. During [[World War II]], Mostar was annexed into the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] [[fascist]] [[puppet state]], the [[Independent State of Croatia]].

During the period of Austro-Hungarian rule (1878–1918), Mostar's city council cooperated with the Austro-Hungarian administration to implement sweeping reforms in city planning: broad avenues and an urban grid were imposed on the western bank of the Neretva, and significant investments were made in infrastructure, communications and housing. City administrators like [[Mustafa Mujaga Komadina]] were central players in these transformations, which facilitated growth and linked the eastern and western banks of the city. Noteworthy examples of Austro-Hungarian architecture include [[Hotel Neretva]], the Municipality building, which was designed by the architect [[Josip Vancaš]] from [[Sarajevo]], residential districts around the Rondo, and [[Gimnazija Mostar]] from 1902 designed by [[František Blažek]].
[[File:8. korpus NOVJ u Mostaru, februar 1945.jpg|thumb|8th Yugoslav Partisans' Corps in liberated Mostar, February 1945]]

After World War II, Mostar developed industries producing [[plastic]]s, [[tobacco]], [[bauxite]], [[wine]], [[aircraft]] and [[aluminium]]. Several [[dam]]s (''Grabovica'', ''Salakovac'', ''Mostar'') were built in the region to harness the [[hydroelectric power]] of the Neretva. The city was a major industrial and tourist center and prospered economically during the time of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].

Between 1948 and 1974 the industrial base was expanded with construction of a [[Metalworking|metal-working]] factory, [[Cotton textile industry|cotton textile mills]], and an aluminum plant. Skilled workers, both men and women, entered the work force and the social and demographic profile of the city was broadened dramatically; between 1945 and 1980, Mostar's population grew from 18,000 to 100,000.

Because Mostar's eastern bank was burdened by inadequate infrastructure, the city expanded on the western bank with the construction of large residential blocks. Local architects favored an austere [[modernist]] aesthetic, prefabrication and repetitive modules. Commercial buildings in the [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalist]] style appeared on the historic eastern side of the city as well, replacing more intimate timber constructions that had survived since Ottoman times. In the 1970s and 1980s, a healthy local economy fueled by foreign investment spurred recognition and conservation of the city's cultural heritage. An economically sustainable plan to preserve the old town of Mostar was implemented by the municipality, which drew thousands of tourists from the Adriatic coast and invigorated the economy of the city. The results of this ten-year project earned Mostar an [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]] in 1986.<ref name="Pasic, Amir 2004"/>

According to the [[1991 population census in Bosnia and Herzegovina|1991 census]], Mostar had 127,000 inhabitants with roughly an equal number of [[Bosniaks]] (34.6%) and [[Croats]] (34%), 18.8% [[Serbs]], and 13.6% of those who declared themselves [[Yugoslavs]] or Others.<ref name=DPC>Bodo Weber, [http://www.democratizationpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DPC-Policy-Note16_The-Wests-Dirty-Mostar-Deal.pdf The West's Dirty Mostar Deal: Deliverables in the Absence of a BiH Policy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201218112532/http://www.democratizationpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DPC-Policy-Note16_The-Wests-Dirty-Mostar-Deal.pdf |date=2020-12-18 }}, ''Democratisation Policy Council'' policy note #16, December 2020</ref>

===Bosnian War===
[[File:Mostar-damagedhouses-2-2001.jpg|thumb|War damage on the former Mostar frontline, 2001]]
After Bosnia and Herzegovina declared [[1992 Bosnian independence referendum|independence]] from Yugoslavia in April 1992, the town was [[Siege of Mostar|besieged]] by the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA), following clashes between the JNA and Croat forces. The Croats were organized into the [[Croatian Defence Council]] (HVO){{sfn|Tanner|2001|p=286}} and were joined by a sizable number of Bosniaks.{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=243}} The JNA artillery periodically shelled neighbourhoods outside of their control from early April.{{sfn|CIA|2002|p=156-157}}

On 7 June the [[Croatian Army]] (HV) launched an offensive code named [[Operation Jackal]], the objective of which was to relieve Mostar and break the JNA [[siege of Dubrovnik]]. The offensive was supported by the HVO, which attacked the [[Army of Republika Srpska]] (VRS) positions around Mostar. By 12 June the HVO secured the western part of the city and by 21 June the VRS was completely pushed out from the eastern part. Numerous religious buildings and most of the city's bridges were destroyed or severely damaged during the fighting.{{sfn|CIA|2002|p=156-157}} Among them were the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Cathedral of Mary, Mother of the Church, Mostar|Cathedral of Mary, Mother of the Church]], the [[Franciscan]] Church and Monastery, the Bishop's Palace and 12 out of 14 mosques in the city. After the VRS was pushed from the city, the [[Serbian Orthodox]] [[Žitomislić Monastery]] and the [[Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, Mostar|Cathedral of the Holy Trinity]] were demolished.{{sfn|Ruggles|2012|p=152-153}}

Throughout late 1992, tensions between Croats and Bosniaks increased in Mostar. In early 1993 the [[Croat–Bosniak War]] escalated and by mid-April 1993 Mostar had become a divided city with the western part dominated by HVO forces and the eastern part controlled by the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (ARBiH).<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica">{{cite web |title=Mostar |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Mostar |access-date=2021-06-17 |archive-date=2021-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210614111106/https://www.britannica.com/place/Mostar |url-status=live }}</ref> Fighting broke out in May when both sides of the city came under intense artillery fire.{{sfn|Christia|2012|p=157-158}} The city was divided along ethnic lines, with a number of offensives taking place, resulting in a series of stalemates.{{sfn|Tanner|2001|p=290}}{{sfn|Christia|2012|p=159}}{{sfn|CIA|2002|p=201}} The Croat–Bosniak conflict ended with the signing of the [[Washington Agreement]] in 1994, and the Bosnian War ended with the [[Dayton Agreement]] in 1995. Around 2,000 people died in Mostar during the war.{{sfn|Yarwood|Seebacher|Strufe|Wolfram|1999|p=4}}

Two wars (Serb forces versus Bosniak and Croatian and Croat-Bosniak war) left Mostar physically devastated and ethno-territorially divided between a Croat-majority west bank (with ca. 55,000 residents) and a Bosniak-majority old City and east bank (with ca. 50,000 residents), with the frontline running parallel to the Neretva River. Most Serbs had fled the city.<ref>Commission for Reforming the City of Mostar: ''Recommendations of the Commission Report of the Chairman'', 15 December 2003, p.55.</ref>

===Post-war developments===
[[File:Bosnia, Mostar, old bridge 2.JPG|thumb|right|The Old Bridge undergoing reconstruction in June 2003.]]

Since the end of the wider war in 1995, great progress has been made in the reconstruction of the city of Mostar under the [[European Union Administration of the City of Mostar]] (EUAM).<ref name="stahn08">{{cite book |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511585937 |title=The Law and Practice of International Territorial Administration |date=2008 |last1=Stahn |first1=Carsten |isbn=978-0-521-87800-5 }}</ref> Over 15 million dollars has been spent on restoration.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

A monumental project to rebuild the Old Bridge, which was destroyed during the [[Bosnian War]] by HVO, to the original design, and restore surrounding structures and historic neighbourhoods was initiated in 1999 and mostly completed by spring 2004. The money for this reconstruction was donated by [[Spain]] {{citation needed|date=June 2013}} (who had a sizable contingent of peacekeeping troops stationed in the surrounding area during the conflict), the [[United States]], [[Turkey]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Croatia]]. A grand opening was held on 23 July 2004 under heavy security.

In parallel, the [[Aga Khan Trust for Culture]] and the [[World Monuments Fund]], with funding provided by the [[World Bank]], undertook a five-year-long restoration and rehabilitation effort to regenerate the most significant areas of historic Mostar, and particularly the urban tissue around the Old Bridge. Also in July 2004, the Stari Grad Agency was launched to operate and maintain the restored buildings, including the Old Bridge complex, and promote Mostar as a cultural and tourist destination.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.akdn.org/news/mostar_230704.html |title=Resurgence of Mostar's Historic City Centre |access-date=2006-11-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206022522/http://www.akdn.org/news/mostar_230704.html |archive-date=2006-12-06}}</ref>

In July 2005, [[UNESCO]] inscribed the Old Bridge and its closest vicinity onto the [[World Heritage List]].

International reconstruction efforts also aimed at the reunification of the divided city. The February 1996 Mostar Agreement led to the adoption of the Interim Statute of the city the same month, and to a 1-year period of EUAM, headed by former [[Bremen]] mayor [[Hans Koschnick]], until early 1997.<ref name="apnews.com">[https://apnews.com/article/03d8ef6db3d846c39d7470e3b4589cfa German diplomat who was EU administrator of Mostar, dies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220905171238/https://apnews.com/article/03d8ef6db3d846c39d7470e3b4589cfa |date=2022-09-05 }}.

After six years of implementation, in 2003 [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|OHR]] [[Paddy Ashdown]] established an "international commission for reforming Mostar", whose final report noted how the HDZ/SDA power-sharing in Mostar had entrenched division and corruption, with "rampant parallelism" in administrative structures and usurpation of power by the municipalities over the City.<ref name=DPC/>{{rp|5}} A new Statute was negotiated, and finally imposed in February 2004 by [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|OHR]] [[Paddy Ashdown]].<ref name=DPC/>{{rp|6}}

In November 2010, the [[Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Constitutional Court]] struck down as discriminatory the electoral framework for Mostar. The Bosniak and Croat ruling parties were unable, however, to reach a new compromise. Lacking a legal basis, local elections could not take place in Mostar in [[2012 Bosnian municipal elections|2012]] and [[2016 Bosnian municipal elections|2016]], and outgoing mayor [[Ljubo Bešlić]] (HDZ BiH) remained in office as the only person authorised to allocate the city budget on an emergency basis. Almost a decade without administration led to a decline in service provision, including trash collection. In October 2019 [[Irma Baralija]] won a case against Bosnia and Herzegovina at the [[European Court of Human Rights]] for the lack of elections in Mostar. Finally, a political deal, agreed under international mediation in June 2020, enabled legislative amendments in July 2020 and the conduct of the vote in Mostar on 20 December 2020.<ref name="reuters.com">{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bosnia-mostar-election-idUSKCN24O1VP |title=Bosnia's city of Mostar to hold election on December 20 after 12 years |newspaper=Reuters |date=July 23, 2020 |via=www.reuters.com |access-date=December 16, 2020 |archive-date=July 26, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200726182943/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bosnia-mostar-election-idUSKCN24O1VP |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Local elections in Mostar">{{Cite web |url=https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-9-2020-002851_EN.html |title=Parliamentary question &#124; Local elections in Mostar &#124; E-002851/2020 &#124; European Parliament |first=Klemen |last=GROŠELJ |website=www.europarl.europa.eu |access-date=2020-12-16 |archive-date=2022-09-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220914033620/https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-9-2020-002851_EN.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Mostar has architecturally noteworthy buildings in a wide range of styles. [[Historicist]] architectural styles reflected [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]] interest and exposure to foreign aesthetic trends and were artfully merged with indigenous styles.<ref name="Zadro-Architecture of Historicism">{{cite web |author1=Sanja Zadro Ursić |date=2014 |title=Architecture of Historicism and Art Nouveau in Mostar |url=https://www.cidom.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Sanja-Zadro-Architecture-of-Historicism-and-Art-Nouve-in-Mostar.pdf |access-date=15 January 2024 |website=cidom.org |language=en}}</ref> Examples include the Italianate Franciscan church, the Ottoman [[Muslibegović House|Muslibegovića house]], the Dalmatian [[Birthplace of Svetozar Ćorović|Ćorović House]] and an [[Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, Mostar|Orthodox church]] which was built as gift from the Sultan.

The Ottomans used monumental architecture to affirm, extend and consolidate their colonial holdings. Administrators and bureaucrats – many of them indigenous people who converted from Christianity to [[Islam]] – founded [[mosque]] complexes that generally included [[Quran|Koranic]] schools, soup kitchens or markets.<ref name="Pasic, Amir 2004">Pasic, Amir.

Out of the thirteen original mosques dating from the 16th and 17th centuries, seven have been lost during the 20th century for ideological reasons or by bombardment. One of the two 19th-century Orthodox churches has also disappeared, while the early 20th-century [[synagogue]], after suffering severe damage in the [[World War II]], has been converted into a theatre. Several Ottoman inns also survived, along with other buildings from this period of Mostar's history, such as fountains and schools.<ref name="whc.unesco.org"/>

The majority of administrative buildings are from the Austro-Hungarian period and have [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] and [[Secession (art)|Secessionist]] characteristics. A number of surviving late Ottoman houses demonstrate the component features of this form of domestic architecture – upper storey for residential use, hall, paved courtyard, and veranda on one or two storeys. The later 19th-century residential houses are predominantly in neoclassical style.<ref name="whc.unesco.org"/>

A number of early trading and craft buildings still exist, notably some low shops in wood or stone, stone storehouses, and a group of former tanneries round an open courtyard. Once again, the 19th-century commercial buildings are predominantly neoclassical. A number of elements of the early fortifications are visible, namely the Hercegusa Tower dating from the medieval period. By contrast, the Ottoman defence edifices are represented by the Halebinovka and Tara Towers – the watchtowers on the ends of the Old Bridge, and a stretch of the ramparts.<ref name="whc.unesco.org"/>

The oldest single arch stone bridge in Mostar, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20170306225556/http://www.bhtourism.ba/eng/whattoseeanddo.wbsp?wbf_mjesto=;2; Kriva Cuprija ("Sloping Bridge")], was built in 1558 by the Ottoman architect Cejvan Kethoda. It is said that this was to be a test before the major construction of the Stari Most began. The Old Bridge was completed in 1566 and was hailed as one of the greatest architectural achievements in the Ottoman  [Balkans]]. The single-arch stone bridge is an exact replica of the original bridge that stood for over 400 years and that was designed by Hajrudin, a student of the great Ottoman architect Sinan. It spans {{cvt|28.7|m|abbr=off}} of the Neretva river, {{cvt|21|m|abbr=off}} above the summer water level. The Halebija and Tara towers have always housed the guardians of the bridge and during Ottoman times were also used as storehouses for ammunition. The arch is a perfect semicircle {{cvt|8.56|m|abbr=off}} in width and {{cvt|4.15|m|abbr=off}} in height. The frontage and vault are made of regular stone cubes incorporated into the horizontal layers all along the vault. The space between vault, frontal walls and footpath is filled with cracked stone. The bridge footpath and the approaching roads are paved with cobblestones, as are the main roads in the town. Stone steps enable people to ascend to the bridge from either side. During the armed conflict between Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats in the Bosnian War in the 1990s, the [[Stari Most|bridge]] was destroyed by the HVO (Croatian Defence Council).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sudetic |first1=Chuck |title=Mostar's Old Bridge Battered to Death |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/10/world/mostar-s-old-bridge-battered-to-death.html |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=29 June 2016 |date=1993-11-10 |archive-date=2016-07-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160719025542/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/10/world/mostar-s-old-bridge-battered-to-death.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Cejvan Cehaj Mosque, built in 1552, is the oldest mosque in Mostar. Later a [[madrasa]] (Islamic school) was built on the same compound. The Old Bazaar, Kujundziluk, is named after the goldsmiths who traditionally created and sold their wares on this street, and still sells authentic paintings and copper or bronze carvings of the Stari Most, pomegranates (the natural symbol of Herzegovina), or the [[Stećak|stećaks]] (medieval tombstones).

The Koski Mehmed Paša Mosque, built in 1617, is open to visitors. Visitors may enter the mosque and take photos free of charge. The [[minaret]] is also open to the public and is accessible from inside the mosque. Just around the corner from the mosque is the Tepa Market. This has been a busy marketplace since Ottoman times. It now sells mostly fresh produce grown in Herzegovina and, when in season, the figs and pomegranates are extremely popular. Local honey is also a prominent specialty, being produced all around Herzegovina.

Mostar cuisine is balanced between Western and Eastern influences. Traditional Mostar food is closely related to [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], [[Middle Eastern]] and other [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean cuisines]]. However, due to years of [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] rule and influence, there are many culinary influences from [[Central Europe]].<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.abebooks.com/9781841620947/Bosnia-Herzegovina-Bradt-Travel-Guide-1841620947/plp |pages=93–97 |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-84162-094-7 |author=Tim Clancy |title=Bosnia & Herzegovina, The Bradt Travel Guide |publisher=Bradt Travel Guides |access-date=2013-06-07 |archive-date=2015-02-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214223524/http://www.abebooks.com/9781841620947/Bosnia-Herzegovina-Bradt-Travel-Guide-1841620947/plp |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Dz0srxxDFoC |pages=87–94 |isbn=978-92-871-5744-7 |title=Culinary cultures of Europe: identity, diversity and dialogue |editor=Darra J.

==Economy==
[[File:Aluminij_Factory_Mostar.jpg|thumb|[[Aluminij]] factory ]]

Mostar's economy relies heavily on the [[aluminium]] and metal industry, banking services and the [[telecommunication]] sector. {{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The city is home of some of the country's largest corporations.

Along with [[Sarajevo]] and [[Banja Luka]], it is the largest financial center in Bosnia and Herzegovina. One of three largest banks in the country has its headquarters in Mostar.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicredit.ba/ba/banka.html#home |title=UniCredit Bank |language=hr |publisher=unicredit.ba |access-date=2013-03-26 |archive-date=2016-12-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223064807/https://www.unicredit.ba/ba/banka.html#home |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biznisinfo.ba/addiko-bank-seli-u-sarajevo-gasi-se-100-radnih-mjesta-u-mostaru/ |title=Addiko Bank seli u Sarajevo: Gasi se 100 radnih mjesta u Mostaru? |date=10 January 2017 |access-date=24 November 2019 |archive-date=23 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210923080201/https://www.biznisinfo.ba/addiko-bank-seli-u-sarajevo-gasi-se-100-radnih-mjesta-u-mostaru/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Bosnia and Herzegovina has three national electric, postal and telecommunication service corporations; the seat of one per each group is placed in Mostar (electric utility provider [[Elektroprivreda HZ HB|Elektroprivreda HZHB]], postal service company [[Hrvatska pošta Mostar]] and [[HT Eronet]], the third largest telecommunication company in the country). These three companies (along with banks and aluminium factory) make a vast portion of overall economic activity in the city. {{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Prior to the 1992–1995 [[Bosnian War]], Mostar relied on other important companies which had been closed, damaged or downsized. They included [[SOKO]] (military aircraft factory), ''Fabrika duhana Mostar'' (tobacco industry), and Hepok (food industry). In 1981, Mostar's GDP per capita was 103% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book |title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju |year=1984 |edition=3rd |publisher=Sveučilišna naklada Liber |location=Zagreb |language=hr |editor1-first=Radovan |editor1-last=Radovinović |editor2-first=Ivan |editor2-last=Bertić}}</ref>

Aluminum manufacturing company [[Aluminij Industries]] is the sole remaining large company that was prominent during the former Yugoslavia. It is one of the country's largest exporter companies and it has a number of international partners. It is one of the most influential companies in the region as well. The city of Mostar alone has direct income of €40 million annually from Aluminij.{{citation_needed|date=October 2018}}

Considering the fact that three dams are situated on the city of Mostar's territory, the city has a solid base for further development of production. There is also an ongoing project for the possible use of wind power and building of windmills. The private sector has seen a notable increase in small and medium enterprises over the past couple of years contributing to the positive business climate. {{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Mostar also hosts the annual [[International Economic Fair Mostar]] ("Međunarodni sajam gospodarstva Mostar")<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mostarski-sajam.com/ |title=NASLOVNICAPočetna stranica |publisher=Mostarski-sajam.com |access-date=2013-03-26 |archive-date=2016-01-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111062333/http://mostarski-sajam.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref> which was first held in 1997.

Its population consists of the following ethnic groups: [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Croats]] (48.4%); [[Bosniaks]] (44.1%) and [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Serbs]] (4.1%). The city of Mostar has the largest population of Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As in many other cities, its demographic profile was significantly altered after the Bosnian War; in the case of Mostar, most of the Serbs left or were forced out of the city{{cn|date=June 2024}}.

According to the official data of the local elections of 2008, among six city election districts, three western ones (Croat-majority) had 53,917 registered voters, and those three on the east (Bosniak-majority) had 34,712 voters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.izbori.ba/Mandati27102008/ShowMunicipality.asp?MunicipalityCode=153&M=1 |title=IZBORI 2008 |publisher=Izbori.ba |access-date=2013-03-26 |archive-date=2012-03-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331121424/http://www.izbori.ba/Mandati27102008/ShowMunicipality.asp?MunicipalityCode=153&M=1 |url-status=live }}</ref>

After the [[Bosnian War]], following the [[Dayton Agreement]], the villages of [[Kamena, Istočni Mostar|Kamena]], [[Kokorina]] and [[Zijemlje]] were separated from Mostar to form the new municipality of [[Istočni Mostar]] (East Mostar), in the [[Republika Srpska]].

==Governance==
[[File:Panorama Mostara 252520035.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Panoramic view of Mostar]]

The City of Mostar has the status of a [[municipality]]. The city government is led by the mayor - since 15 February 2021 [[Mario Kordić]] ([[Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina|HDZ BiH]]).

===Interim Statute (1996–2004)===
International reconstruction efforts aimed at the reunification of the divided city. The February 1996 Mostar Agreement led to the adoption of the Interim Statute of the city the same month and to a 1-year period of EU Administration of Mostar (EUAM), headed by former [[Bremen]] mayor [[Hans Koschnick]], till early 1997.<ref name="apnews.com"/>

The Interim Statute introduced a Yugoslav-style two-level of administration, with a City level with its own council and mayor (with two deputies) and six municipalities, each with its own administration and council, reflecting the wartime division: three in the Croat-majority West Mostar, and three in the Bosniak-majority East Mostar. A tiny "Central Zone" strip (not a municipality) was to host the rebuilt institutions of the city and, according to the original plans, also of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Federation entity]].
Mostar citizens would cast three votes: the first two for the City council's 48 members (half from a city-wide lift and half from candidates in each municipality, 4 each), and the third to elect the members of the councils of the six municipalities. Ethnic quotas and veto rights were to prevent any domination.<ref name=DPC/>{{rp|4}}

===2004 Statute===
After six years of implementation, in 2003 [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|OHR]] [[Paddy Ashdown]] established an "international commission for reforming Mostar", whose final report noted how the HDZ/SDA power-sharing in Mostar had entrenched division and corruption, with "rampant parallelism" in administrative structures and usurpation of power by the municipalities over the City.<ref name=DPC/>{{rp|5}} The Mostar Commission, headed by another former German mayor, [[Norbert Winterstein]], gathered members of all Mostar parties with the overarching aim of reuniting the city. A new Statute was negotiated, although few points of contention remained. Finally, in February 2004 [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|OHR]] [[Paddy Ashdown]] imposed via its Bonn Powers the new City Statute and related amendments to the BiH Election Law and cantonal and Federation Constitutions. The 2004 Statute abolished the six municipalities and created a unified City administration with a single budget and one Mayor of Mostar, with no deputies. Ethnic quotas in the City council were replaced by minimum/maximum thresholds; 17 councillors would now be elected from a city-wide list, and 18 from the territories of the six former municipalities, now "city areas", which retained a single residual competence on "the distribution of revenues deriving from allocated construction land", managed by city area "commissions" formed by the 3 city councillors elected in each one. The "central zone" remained outside any city area, and its residents were only entitled to vote for the city-wide list.<ref name=DPC/>{{rp|6}}

According to the City Statute, imposed by [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|High Representative]] [[Paddy Ashdown]] on 28 January 2004 after local politicians failed to reach an agreement, the mayor of Mostar has to be elected by the city council with a two-thirds majority.<ref>{{cite web |author=Piše: srijeda, 28.1.2004. 15:53 |url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/ashdown-nametnuo-novi-ustroj-mostara/183132.aspx |title=Ashdown nametnuo novi ustroj Mostara - Vijesti.net |publisher=Index.hr |date=2004-01-28 |access-date=2013-03-26 |archive-date=2013-05-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525044335/http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/ashdown-nametnuo-novi-ustroj-mostara/183132.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="ohr.int">{{cite web |url=http://www.ohr.int/decisions/mo-hncantdec/default.asp?content_id=31708 |title=Odluka kojom se proglašava Statut Grada Mostara |publisher=Ohr.int |date=2004-01-28 |access-date=2013-03-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401225925/http://www.ohr.int/decisions/mo-hncantdec/default.asp?content_id=31708 |archive-date=2013-04-01}}</ref> Ashdown abolished the six municipalities that were divided equally among Bosniaks and Croats and replaced them with six electoral units,<ref name="isn">{{cite web |url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Current-Affairs/Security-Watch/Detail/?ots591=4888CAA0-B3DB-1461-98B9-E20E7B9C13D4&lng=en&id=107315 |title=Hopeful rebirth for Bosnia's divided Mostar / ISN |publisher=Isn.ethz.ch |date=2004-02-03 |access-date=2013-06-07 |archive-date=2011-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614090837/http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Current-Affairs/Security-Watch/Detail/?ots591=4888CAA0-B3DB-1461-98B9-E20E7B9C13D4&lng=en&id=107315 |url-status=live }}</ref> ridding Mostar of duplicate institutions and costs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ohr.int/ohr-dept/presso/pic/mostar-one-city/default.asp?content_id=31689 |title=High Representative's Letter to the Citizens of Mostar |publisher=Ohr.int |date=2004-01-28 |access-date=2013-03-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401225919/http://www.ohr.int/ohr-dept/presso/pic/mostar-one-city/default.asp?content_id=31689 |archive-date=2013-04-01}}</ref> In the process Ashdown also reduced the number of elected officials from 194 to 35.<ref name="isn"/> According to the City Statute, the constituent peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs) are guaranteed a minimum of four seats and a maximum of 15 seats.<ref name="isn"/> 18 councillors are elected by election units (3 councillors from each of the 6 districts) and 15 councillors from a city-wide list.<ref name="ohr.int"/> This move was opposed by the [[Party of Democratic Action]] (SDA) and the [[Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (HDZ BiH).<ref name="isn"/>

===2008 elections===
On the basis of the [[2008 Bosnian municipal elections|2008 election]], the City Council was composed of 35 councillors from the following parties:

*[[Party of Democratic Action]] (SDA) 12
*[[People's Party Work for Prosperity]] (NSRzB) 7
*[[Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (HDZ BiH) 7
*[[Social Democratic Party (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Social Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (SDP BiH) 3
*[[Croatian Democratic Union 1990]] (HDZ 1990) 3
*[[Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (SBiH) 2
*[[Croatian Party of Rights of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (HSP BiH) 1

Relative winners were SDA with the greatest number of votes. However, neither party had enough votes to ensure election of the mayor from their party. The City Council met 16 times without success. Eventually, [[OHR]] was involved, and High Representative made some minor changes to the City Statute. After that, [[Ljubo Bešlić]] ([[Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina|HDZ BiH]]) was reelected as a mayor.

===2010 Constitutional Court ruling===
Following an appeal by [[Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina|HDZ BiH]], in November 2010 the [[Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Constitutional Court]] found the electoral framework for Mostar (2004 Statute) to be discriminatory and unconstitutional.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ustavnisud.ba/dokumenti/_en/U-9-09-386218.pdf |title=CC BiH, U-9/09 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Among other things, the Constitutional Court noted that the votes of Mostar residents did not count the same, as the six electoral zones all elected 3 councillors despite their different population (with the smallest having 4 times fewer residents than the largest); and that the voters from the "central zone" counted less, as they only elected representatives from the city-wide list and not from any of the electoral zones.
The Court annulled the relevant provisions of the Election Law of BiH and of the 2004 Statute, and ordered the Parliamentary Assembly of BiH and the Mostar city assembly to revise them within six months.<ref name=DPC/>{{rp|6}} Yet, the Bosniak and Croat ruling parties did not get to a compromise.

===Interim administration (2012–2020)===
In the absence of a legal basis, local elections could not take place in Mostar in [[2012 Bosnian municipal elections|2012]] and [[2016 Bosnian municipal elections|2016]]. The mandate of the City council also expired in 2012. Bešlić thus remained as acting mayor for eight additional years, during which he affirmed that he considered resigning multiple times,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ba.boell.org/en/2020/09/10/ljubo-beslic-potenciranje-iz-sarajeva-kako-je-mostar-podijeljen-grad-otvara-se-prica-da |title=Ljubo Bešlić: When Sarajevo keeps emphasising how Mostar is a divided city, people start talking about dividing that city &#124; Heinrich Böll Stiftung &#124; Ured u Sarajevo - Bosnia and Herzegovina |website=Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung |access-date=2020-12-09 |archive-date=2021-09-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210922061001/https://ba.boell.org/en/2020/09/10/ljubo-beslic-potenciranje-iz-sarajeva-kako-je-mostar-podijeljen-grad-otvara-se-prica-da |url-status=live }}</ref> also due to his deteriorating health.<ref name=RFE>{{Cite news |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/bosnia-mostar-beslic-eternal-mayor-ailing-city-services-vacuum-of-democracy-/30316500.html |title=With Mostar's 'Eternal Mayor' Ailing, Will Change Finally Come To Bosnia's 'Vacuum Of Democracy'? |newspaper=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |date=10 December 2019 |access-date=2020-12-09 |archive-date=2020-12-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201221173831/https://www.rferl.org/a/bosnia-mostar-beslic-eternal-mayor-ailing-city-services-vacuum-of-democracy-/30316500.html |url-status=live |last1=Synovitz |first1=Ron |last2=Behram |first2=Mirsad }}</ref> During this time, he shared the administrative duties with Izet Šahović, head of the Mostar City's Finance Department, a bureaucrat and member of the [[Bosniak]] [[Party of Democratic Action]] (SDA). For two full mandates, Bešlić and Šahović have decided together how to disburse Mostar's yearly 30 million euro budget, without any legislative oversight or public transparency. The situation has been denounced by multiple NGOs, which have pointed at the SDA-HDZ power-sharing as the source of the mal-administration of Mostar and the recurrent problems with trash collection, water treatment, and continued ethnic duplication of the city services.<ref name=RFE/>

During this period, several rounds of talks were held with international facilitation. Between October 2012 and May 2013 Deputy [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|High Representative]] [[Roderick W. Moore]] launched an 8-months mediation effort that produced a compromise framework aimed at merging the city areas (and central zone) into multi-ethnic voting districts. This was endorsed by the [[Peace Implementation Council]]'s Steering Board (PIC SB). Yet, the proposal found no political support when it was submitted by Moore's successor [[Tamir G. Waser]] in July 2014 to the [[Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina|BiH Parliament]]. A second mediation attempt led by US and UK ambassadors to BiH, [[Maureen Cormack]] and [[Edward Ferguson]], and based on a model with a single city-wide electoral district, also failed [in 2017]. In 2018, the two main parties HDZ BiH and SDA autonomously negotiated a compromise solution, based only on a formula for the election of the councillors from each city area along the "one man, one vote" principle, which would be later taken up in the June 2020 agreement.<ref name=DPC/>{{rp|6}} 

In October 2019, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled against [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in the case brought by [[Irma Baralija]] on the absence of electoral rights for the residents of Mostar.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/fre?i=002-12638 |title=HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights |website=hudoc.echr.coe.int |access-date=2022-07-15 |archive-date=2022-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220715013957/https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/fre?i=002-12638 |url-status=live }}</ref> In July 2020, the Parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina amended the electoral law to allow for local elections in Mostar to be held in [[2020 Bosnian municipal elections|December 2020]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/date-confirmed-for-mostar-s-first-local-elections-in-12-years/30744810.html |title=Date Confirmed For Mostar's First Local Elections In 12 Years |newspaper=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |date=24 July 2020 |access-date=2020-12-09 |archive-date=2020-12-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201221174156/https://www.rferl.org/a/date-confirmed-for-mostar-s-first-local-elections-in-12-years/30744810.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="reuters.com"/><ref name="Local elections in Mostar"/>

Mostar has a number of various educational institutions. These include [[University of Mostar]], [[University Džemal Bijedić of Mostar]], [[United World College in Mostar]], nineteen high-schools and twenty four elementary schools.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bljesak.info/content/view/37733/158/ |trans-title=Classes begin for 15,000 students in Mostar |title=Počela nastava za 15 000 učenika na području Mostara |website=www.bljesak.info |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909182607/http://www.bljesak.info/content/view/37733/158/ |archive-date=September 9, 2009}}</ref> High-schools include sixteen vocational schools and three gymnasiums.<ref>{{cite web |author=asdf121 16.01.2012. |url=http://www.mostarinfo.net/mostar/opce_informacije/srednje_skole |title=Srednje škole / Opće informacije / Mostar / INFO |language=hr |publisher=MOSTARinfo |date=2012-01-16 |access-date=2013-03-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728184810/http://www.mostarinfo.net/mostar/opce_informacije/srednje_skole |archive-date=2013-07-28}}</ref>

All public schools in Mostar, both elementary and secondary education, are divided between Croat curriculum and Federal (unofficially Bosniak) curriculum schools. This ethnic division of schools was emplaced during the very first year of the [[Bosnian War|Bosnian war]] and it continues, with some modifications, to this day. Today, the schools in Mostar and throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina are a site of struggle between ethno-national political elites<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/bih/ba/media_14091.html |title=UNICEF Bosnia and Herzegovina - Info centar - Podijeljene škole u BiH |website=www.unicef.org |access-date=2016-03-08 |archive-date=2016-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308172338/http://www.unicef.org/bih/ba/media_14091.html |url-status=dead}}</ref> in ways that reveals the precarious position of youth in the volatile nation building processes<ref>{{Cite book |last=Laketa |first=Sunčana |date=2015-01-01 |publisher=Springer Singapore |isbn=9789814585941 |editor-last=Kallio |editor-first=Kirsi |series=Geographies of Children and Young People |pages=1–13 |language=en |doi=10.1007/978-981-4585-94-1_6-1 |editor-last2=Mills |editor-first2=Sarah |editor-last3=Skelton |editor-first3=Tracey |title=Politics, Citizenship and Rights |chapter=Youth as Geopolitical Subjects: The Case of Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina}}</ref> A partial exception to divided education is [[Gimnazija Mostar]] (also known as "Stara gimnazija") that implemented joint school administration and some joint student courses.

The country's higher education reform and the signing of the [[Bologna Process]] have forced both universities to put aside their rivalry to some extent and try to make themselves more competitive on a regional level.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

[[University of Mostar]] is the second largest university in the country and the only Croatian language university in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was founded in 1977 as the University "Džemal Bijedić" of Mostar, but changed name in 1992. The origin of the university can be traced back to the Herzegovina Franciscan Theological School, which was founded in 1895 and closed in 1945, was the first higher education institution in Mostar.<ref>{{cite book |title=Report on higher education in Bosnia and Herzegovina : historical development, present state, and needs assessment |year=1996 |publisher=UNESCO/CEPES |location=Bucharest |isbn=978-9290691419 |author=Sreben Dizdar, Bakaršić Kemal |editor=Leland C. Barrows |page=23}}</ref> Today's University seal shows the building of the Franciscan Monastery.

[[University Džemal Bijedić of Mostar]] was founded in 1993. It employs around 250 professors and staff members. According to the Federal Office of Statistics, Džemal Bijedić University had 2,522 students enrolled during the 2012/2013 academic year.<ref name="fzs.ba">{{cite web |url=http://fzs.ba/saopcenja/2015/12.3.pdf |title=UPISANI STUDENTI NA VISOKOŠKOLSKIM USTANOVAMA ŠKOLSKA 2014./2015.GODINA |access-date=2013-06-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120083928/http://fzs.ba/saopcenja/2015/12.3.pdf |archive-date=2015-01-20}}</ref>

==Sports==
One of the most popular sports in Mostar is [[Association football|football]]. The two most successful teams are [[HŠK Zrinjski Mostar|HŠK Zrinjski]] and [[FK Velež Mostar|FK Velež]]. FK Velež won the [[Yugoslav Cup]] in [[1980–81 Yugoslav Cup|1981]] and in [[1985–86 Yugoslav Cup|1986]], which was one of the most significant accomplishments this club has achieved. Since the [[Bosnian War]], each club has generally been supported by a particular ethnic group (Velež for the Bosniaks and Zrinjski for the Croats). The matches between the two clubs are some of the country's most intense matches. Since the start of the [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], HŠK Zrinjski has won eight championships.

In [[basketball]], [[HKK Zrinjski Mostar]] competes at the nation's highest level while the [[HMRK Zrinjski Mostar|Zrinjski]] banner also represents the city in the top [[handball]] league.
