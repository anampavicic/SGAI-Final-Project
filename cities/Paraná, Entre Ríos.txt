'''Paraná''' ({{IPA|es|paɾaˈna}}) is the capital city of the [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Provinces of Argentina|province]] [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]], located on the eastern shore of the [[Paraná River]], opposite the city of [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], capital of the neighbouring [[Santa Fe Province]]. The city has a population of 268,889 inhabitants with its [[metropolitan area]], Greater Paraná, having 391,962 inhabitants. ({{census-ar|2022}})<ref>https://www.entrerios.gov.ar/dgec/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Primero-datos-provisionales-Censo-2022-Entre-Rios-Febrero-2023-1.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=August 2024}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-07-13 |title=Censo 2022: Entre Ríos tiene 1.415.097 habitantes y se conoció la población de cada ciudad |url=https://www.analisisdigital.com.ar/provinciales/2024/07/13/censo-2022-entre-rios-tiene-1415097-habitantes-y-se-conocio-la-poblacion-de |access-date=2024-07-15 |website=Análisis |language=es-AR}}</ref>

==History==
During the 16th century, inhabitants of the city of [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]] settled at the other shore of the Paraná river. The first settlers called it “''Baxada del Paraná''”.

Between [[1854]] and [[1861]], it was the capital city of the [[Argentine Confederation]].

==Economy==
Paraná is not only the head of the provincial government, but also an important [[river port]] for the [[transshipment]] of cereals, cattle, fish, and lumber from the surrounding region. The principal industries installed are the manufacture of [[cement]], furniture, and ceramics.

==Cityscape==
The city center brings together colonial churches, European styles seen in structures like the 3 de Febrero Theatre or the Government House, the blended architectural styles of the city's Cathedral, and modern towers, such as those found near Parque Urquiza park. The city is connected to the city of [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]] on the other side of the [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]] by the [[Hernandarias Subfluvial Tunnel]] inaugurated in 1969.
