'''Zakarpattia Oblast''' ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: Закарпатська область), also referred to as simply '''Zakarpattia''' ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: Закарпаття; [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Kárpátalja'') or '''Transcarpathia''' in English, is an [[Administrative divisions of Ukraine|oblast]] located in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in west [[Ukraine]], mostly coterminous with the historical region of [[Carpathian Ruthenia]]. Its [[Capital (political)|administrative centre]] is the city of [[Uzhhorod]]. Other major cities within the oblast include [[Mukachevo]], [[Khust]], [[Berehove]], and [[Chop, Ukraine|Chop]], the last of which is home to railroad transport infrastructure.

Zakarpattia Oblast was established on 22 January 1946, after [[Third Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] gave up its claim to the territory of [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Subcarpathian Ruthenia]] ([[Czech language|Czech]] and also [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: Podkarpatská Rus) under a treaty between Czechoslovakia and the [[Soviet Union]]. The territory of Subcarpathian Ruthenia was then [[Soviet annexation of Transcarpathia|taken over by the USSR]] and became part of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]].

During the [[1991 Ukrainian independence referendum|Ukrainian independence referendum]] held in 1991, [[1991 Transcarpathian general regional referendum|Zakarpatska Oblast voters were given a separate option]] on whether or not they favoured [[autonomy]] for the region.<ref name="magocsi"/> Although a large majority favoured autonomy, it was not granted.<ref name="magocsi"/> However, this referendum was about self-government status, not about autonomy (like in Crimea).<ref name="kuzio">{{cite journal| last= Kuzio| first= Taras| title= The Rusyn Question in Ukraine: sorting out fact from fiction| journal= Canadian Review of Studies in Nationalism| volume= XXXII| issue= 2005}}</ref>

Situated in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] of western Ukraine, except the southwestern Hungarian-populated region that belongs to the [[Hungarian plain]], Zakarpattia Oblast is the only Ukrainian administrative division which borders upon four countries: [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], and [[Romania]]. As the Carpathians are an important tourist and travel destination (housing many ski and spa resorts), they play a major part in the oblast's economy.

With a land area of almost {{convert|13000|km2}}, the oblast is ranked [[List of Ukrainian oblasts and territories by area|23rd by area]] and [[List of Ukrainian oblasts and territories by population|15th by population]] as according to the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]], the population of Zakarpatska Oblast was 1,254,614. The current population is {{Ua-pop-est2022|1,244,476|punct=.}} This total includes people of many different nationalities of which [[Hungarians]], [[Romanians]], and [[Rusyns]] constitute significant minorities in some of the province's cities, while in others, they form the majority of the population (as in the case of Berehove).

==Name==
The oblast's name Zakarpattia ({{langx|uk|Закарпаття|Zakarpattia}}), which translates as "Transcarpathian" or literally "beyond the Carpathians," refers to its location on the western side of the [[Carpathian Mountains]], a major [[mountain range]] that forms an arc across [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Southeast Europe]]. Due to this, the oblast is also often called '''Transcarpathian Oblast''' or '''Transcarpathia''', although the historical region of [[Transcarpathia]] also includes areas outside the oblast, specifically small parts of [[Slovakia]] (mostly in [[Prešov Region]] and [[Košice Region]]) as well as Poland's [[Lemko Region]]. Other historical names for both the oblast and broader region include Transcarpathian Ruthenia, Transcarpathian Ukraine, and Carpathian Ruthenia. The region is also sometimes referred to as "Subcarpathian" (which translates literally to "below (or "feet of") the Carpathians"), such as in Subcarpathian Rus' and Subcarpathia. This name refers to the area's location in the lower elevation [[Carpathian Basin]] (also known as the Pannonian Basin) and is also a reference to the largely overlapping physical geographical region of [[Prykarpattia]] (the Ukrainian name for Ciscarpathia), which encompasses the [[Eastern Carpathian Foothills|northeastern foothills]] of the Carpathian Mountains.

Many historical names included ''Rus''' or ''Ruthenian'' when referring to the region because of the area's large population of [[Rusyns]] (also known as ''Carpatho-Rusyns'', ''Ruthenians'', or ''Rusnaks''), an [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] ethnic group that speaks the [[Rusyn language]] and descend from the original East Slavic population that had inhabited the northeastern regions of the [[Divisions of the Carpathians|Eastern Carpathians]] since the [[Early Middle Ages]]. Transcarpathian/Carpathian Ruthenia, Subcarpathian Rus', and the Ukrainian [[Diminutive|diminutive]] name Rusinko are amongst some of the names that reference the [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]]-speaking population.

The oblast has various names in other languages, including: 
*{{langx|hu|Kárpátalja}} ({{translation|hu|''Base of the Carpathians''}}
*{{langx|sk|Zakarpatská oblasť}}; {{lang|sk|Podkarpatská Rus}}
*{{langx|cs|Zakarpatská oblast}}; {{lang|cs|Podkarpatská Rus}}
*{{langx|pl|Obwód zakarpacki}}
*{{langx|ro|Regiunea Transcarpatia}} ({{IPA|ro|red͡ʒiˈune̯a transkarˈpat͡i.a|}})
*{{langx|ru|Закарпатская область}} ([[Romanization of Russian|translit.]] {{transliteration|ru|''Zakarpatskaya oblast''}})
*{{langx|uk|Закарпатська область}} ([[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]] {{transliteration|uk|''Zakarpatska oblast''}})
*[[Rusyn language|Rusyn]]: ''Закарпатська область''
*{{langx|en|Subcarpathia, Subcarpathian Rus', Subcarpathian Ruthenia, Sub-Carpathian Ukraine}} 
*{{langx|fr|Ukraine Subcarpathique}}
*{{langx|de|Karpatenrussland, Karpatenland, Karpathenland, Karpatho-Russland, Karpatenukraine, Karpato-Ukraine}}

While the name ''Transcarpathia'' is a translation of the Ukrainian version of the name, the Hungarian name translates as ''Subcarpathia'', in-line with the name of other Hungarian regions such as [[Alpokalja]], a [[Sub-alpine|sub-Alpine]] territory in western Hungary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hhrf.org/mekk/egyutt10.pdf|title=The name "Kárpátalja", as it appears on the cover of the journal of the Transcarpathian section of the Hungarian Writers' Union|access-date=2014-03-02}}</ref> The ''Transcarpathia'' name and its variants instead reflect the [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic language]] practice of emphasizing the area's location "past" or "beyond" the Carpathians (as opposed to "below"). [[Western Europe|Western European languages]] have variously translated from the Hungarian or East Slavic language versions of the name, with the [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] names generally deriving from the Hungarian ''Subcarpathia''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zeus.nyf.hu/~nemettsz/subkarpatien.pdf|title=Christian Pischlöger: Kárpátalja vagy Kárpátontúl?

[[File:Maramures Josephinische Landesaufnahme 1782-1785 Background.jpg|County of Maramures in the Kingdom of Hungary overlaid with the current states of Ukraine and Romania|thumb|right]]
According to the [[Chronicon Pictum]], the earliest state established in Zakarpattia was [[Ungvar]]i in 677 AD. The name Ungvar derives from a migration of the [[Onoğurs|Onogur]]s<ref>"Attila and the Nomad Hordes" Dr David Nicolle, 1990</ref> of [[Poltava]] who were ruled by the northern Kubiar<ref>"Bulgarian contributions to European civilization" Atanas Bozhkov, 1994</ref> sons of [[Kubrat]]. The Onogur tribes entered [[Etelköz]] through the [[Verecke Pass]]. Some of Ungvari's Kubiars under [[Khan-Tuvan]] eventually joined the Rus' to form [[Rus' Khaganate]]. In the late 9th century Ungvari's ruling [[Árpád dynasty]] began to fulfil their ambitions for the Carpathian basin where by 895 they had relocated to rule over the [[Magyars]].

According to the [[Gesta Hungarorum]], as Prince [[Álmos]] entered on the castle of ''Hung'' and there he appointed his son [[Árpád]] as the primary ruler, hence he was called of the leader of ''Hungvária'', while all of his valiant soldiers as ''Hungvárus'', so since then all the Magyars have been known by this name internationally.

In 895 the Hungarian tribes entered the Carpathian Basin from here through the Verecke pass, and the lands of Transcarpathia were influenced by the [[Principality of Hungary]] since 895, which transformed the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in 1000. In Transcarpathia, the [[Voivodeship of Maramureș]], granted to a small [[Romanians|Romanian]] nobility, was established in 1343. The region was reorganized into the [[Máramaros County]] in 1402.

Since 1867, it was part of the [[Transleithania|Hungarian]] side of [[Austria-Hungary]] until the latter's demise at the end of [[World War I]]. It approximately consisted of four Hungarian counties ([[Counties of the Kingdom of Hungary|comitatus]]): [[Bereg County|Bereg]], [[Ung County|Ung]], [[Ugocsa County|Ugocsa]] and [[Máramaros County|Maramaros]]. This region was briefly part of the short-lived [[West Ukrainian National Republic]] in 1918. The region was occupied by [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] by the end of that year, mostly the eastern portion such as [[Rakhiv]] and [[Khust]]. It was later recaptured by the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] in the summer of 1919. Finally, after the [[Treaty of Trianon]] of 1920 it became part of [[Czechoslovakia]] with a supposedly equal level of autonomy as the Slovak lands and Bohemia-Moravia-Czech Silesia (Czech lands).<ref name="Orest2000">{{cite book|title=Ukraine: A History|author=Subtelny, Orest|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|year=2000|isbn=0-8020-8390-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ukrainehistory00subt_0/page/448 448]|author-link=Orest Subtelny|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ukrainehistory00subt_0/page/448}}</ref>[[File:Hungary-ethnic groups.jpg|thumb|The 1885 ethnographic map of Kingdom of Hungary, based on 1880 census, with [[Ruthenians]] identified in orange (northeastern, upper-right hand corner)]]
The province has a unique footnote in history as the only region in the former Czechoslovakia to have had an [[United States|American]] governor: its first governor was [[Gregory Zhatkovich]], an American citizen who had earlier emigrated from the region and represented the Rusyn community in the U.S. Zhatkovich was appointed governor by Czechoslovakia's first president, [[Tomáš Masaryk|T. G. Masaryk]] in 1920, and served for about one year until he resigned over differences regarding the region's autonomy. In 1928, it adopted the name of '''[[Carpathian Ruthenia|Subcarpathian Rus']]''' ({{langx|cs|Podkarpatská Rus}}). Nevertheless, such autonomy was granted as late as in 1938, after detrimental events of the [[Munich Agreement|Munich Conference]]; until then this land was administered directly from [[Prague]] by the government-appointed provincial presidents (''{{lang|cs|zemští prezidenti}}'') and/or elected governors (''{{lang|cs|guvernéři}}'').

Following the Munich Agreement, the southern part of the region was awarded to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]] under the [[First Vienna Award]] in 1938. The remaining portion was constituted as an autonomous region of the short-lived [[Second Czechoslovak Republic]]. After the Slovak declaration of an [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|independent state]] on 14 March, the next day [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] was proclaimed as an independent republic but was immediately occupied and annexed by Hungary,<ref name="a">Subtelny, p. 458</ref> and the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] was proclaimed a day after. [[Avgustyn Voloshyn|Voloshyn]] asked support for recognition in advance from Hitler, but received no answer. The state is known as 'the one-day republic' because it did not exist more than one day.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Robert Magocsi|title=With Their Backs to the Mountains: A History of Carpathian Rus? and Carpatho-Rusyns|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nzj2DAAAQBAJ&q=Carpatho-Ukraine+one+day+Republic&pg=PA197|date=30 November 2015|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-615-5053-46-7|page=197}}</ref> The military operations and the occupation of Carpatho-Ukraine was finished by the Hungarian troops on March 18.<ref name="2660044karpatskoiukraini2660044bkarpatskoiukraini"/>

During the German occupation of Hungary (March–December 1944), almost the entire Jewish population was deported; few survived the [[Holocaust]].<ref name="all_zakarpattya-history">{{cite web|url=http://all.zakarpattya.net/eng/begin.html|title=History of the region|access-date=2007-06-01|work=All Zakarpattya|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404023619/http://all.zakarpattya.net/eng/begin.html|archive-date=2007-04-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In October 1944, the region was occupied by the [[Red Army]]. On 26 November 1944, the First Congress of People's Committees of Zakarpattia Ukraine took place in [[Mukachevo]],<ref name=7dniv/> and sham elections were organized on 10–25 November 1944.<ref>[http://leksika.com.ua/ure/pershiy_zyizd_narodnih_komitetiv_zakarpatskoyi_ukrayini First Congress of People's Committees of Zakarpattia Ukraine (ПЕРШИЙ З'ЇЗД НАРОДНИХ КОМІТЕТІВ ЗАКАРПАТСЬКОЇ УКРАЇНИ)].

It was then [[Soviet annexation of Transcarpathia|annexed into the Soviet Union]] as Zakarpattia Oblast.<ref name="all_zakarpattya-history"/>

=== Zakarpattia in the Soviet Union ===
Between 1945 and 1947, the new Soviet authorities fortified the new borders, and in July 1947 declared Transcarpathia as "restricted zone of the highest level", with checkpoints on the mountain passes connecting the region to mainland Ukraine.<ref name="magocsi2">[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nzj2DAAAQBAJ With Their Backs to the Mountains: A History of Carpathian Rus? and Carpatho-Rusyns], by Paul Robert Magocsi, Central European University Press, 2015</ref>

In December 1944, the National Council of Transcarpatho-Ukraine set up a special people's tribunal in [[Uzhgorod]] to try and condemn all collaborationists with the previous governments – both Hungary and Carpatho-Ukraine. The court was allowed to hand down either 10 years of forced labour, or death penalty. Several Ruthenian leaders, including {{ill|Andrej Bródy|cs}} and {{ill|Štefan Fencik|cs}}, were condemned and executed in May 1946. [[Avgustyn Voloshyn]] also died in prison. The extent of the repression showed to many Carpatho-Ruthenian activists that it was not possible to find an accommodation with the coming Soviet regime as it had been with all previous ones.<ref name=magocsi/>

After breaking the [[Greek Catholic Church]] in Eastern [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] in 1946, Soviet authorities pushed for the return to Orthodoxy of Greek-Catholic parishes in Transcarpathia too, including by engineering the accident and death of recalcitrant bishop [[Theodore Romzha]] on 1 November 1947. In January 1949, the [[Greek Catholic Eparchy of Mukachevo]] was declared illegal; remaining priests and nuns were arrested, and church properties were nationalised and parcelled for public use or lent to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] (Moscow Patriarchate) as the only accepted religious authority in the region.<ref name=magocsi/>

Cultural institutions were also forbidden, including the russophile Dukhnovych Society, the ukrainophile Prosvita, and the Subcarpathian Scholarly Society. New books and publications were circulated, including the ''Zakarpatsk{{'}}a Pravda'' (130,000 copies). The [[Uzhhorod National University]] was opened in 1945. Over 816 cinemas were open by 1967 to insure the indoctrination of the population with Marxist-Leninist propaganda. The [[Ukrainian language]] was the first language of instruction in schools throughout the region, followed by [[Russian language|Russian]], which was extensively used at the university level. Most new generations had a passive knowledge of the [[Rusyn language]], but no knowledge about local culture. XIX-century Rusyn intellectuals were labelled as "members of the reactionary class and instruments of Vatican obscurantism". The Rusyn anthem and hymn were banned from public performance. Carpatho-Rusyn folk culture and songs, which were promoted, were presented as part of Transcarpathian regional culture as a local variant of Ukrainian culture.<ref name=magocsi/>

As early as 1924, the [[Comintern]] had declared all East Slavic inhabitants of Czechoslovakia ([[Rusyns]], Carpatho-Russians, [[Rusnaks]]) to be [[Ukrainians]]. As of the 1946 census, all Rusyns were recorded as Ukrainians; anyone clinging to the old label was considered a separatist and a potential counter-revolutionary.{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}

Already in February 1945, the National Council proceeded to confiscate 53,000 hectares of land from big landowners and redistribute it to 54,000 peasant households (37% of the population). Forced collectivisation of land started in 1946; around 2,000 peasants were arrested during protests in 1948–49 and sent for forced labour in the [[Gulag]]. Collectivisation, including of mountain shepherds, was completed by May 1950. Central planning decisions set Transcarpathia to become a "land of orchards and vineyards" between 1955 and 1965, planting 98,000 hectares with little results. Attempts to cultivate tea and citrus also failed due to climate. Most vineyards were uprooted twenty years later, during [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s anti-alcohol campaign in 1985–87.<ref name=magocsi/>

The Soviet period also meant the upscaling of industrialisation in Transcarpathia. State-owned lumber mills, chemical and food-processing plants widened, with Mukachevo's tobacco factory and Solotvyno's salt works as the biggest ones, providing steady employment to the residents of the region, beyond the traditional subsistence agriculture. And while traditional labour migration routes to the fields of Hungary or the factories of the Nort-West United States were now closed, Carpathian Ruthens and Romanians could now move for seasonal work in Russia's North and East.<ref name=magocsi/>

The inhabitants of the oblast grew steadily in the Soviet period, from 776,000 in 1946 to over 1,2 million in 1989. Uzhgorod increased its residents five-fold, from 26,000 to 117,000, and [[Mukachevo]] likewise from 26,600 to 84,000. This population increase also reflected demographic changes. The arrival of the Red Army meant the departure of 5,100 Magyars and 2,500 Germans, while the 15–20,000 Jews survivors of the Holocaust also decided to move out before the borders were sealed. By 1945, around 30,000 Hungarians and Germans had been interned and sent for labour camps in Eastern Ukraine and Siberia; while amnestied in 1955, around 5,000 did not come back. In January 1946, 2,000 more Germans were deported. In return, a large number of Ukrainians and Russians moved to Transcarpathia, where they found jobs in the industry, the military, or the civilian administration. By 1989, around 170,000 Ukrainians (mainly from nearby Galizia) and 49,000 Russians were living in Transcarpathia, mainly in new residential blocks in the main towns of Uzhgorod and Mukachevo, where the dominant language had soon turned from [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] to Russian. They kept being considered newcomers (''novoprybuli'') due to their disconnect from the Rusyn- and Hungarian-speaking countryside.<ref name=magocsi/>

=== Zakarpattia in independent Ukraine ===
After the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Ukraine held an independence referendum in which the residents of Zakarpattia were asked about the Zakarpattia Oblast Council's proposal for self-rule.<ref name="magocsi">{{cite book |title=Ukraine: An Illustrated History|last=Magocsi|first=Paul Robert|year=2007|publisher=[[University of Washington Press]]|location=[[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]]|isbn=978-0-295-98723-1}}</ref> About 78% of the oblast's population voted in favour of autonomy; however, it was not granted.<ref name="magocsi"/>

At the [[1991 Ukrainian presidential election|first Presidential elections in Ukraine in 1991]], voters from Transcarpathia supported [[Leonid Kravchuk]] by 58%.
At the [[1994 Ukrainian parliamentary election]], Transcarpathia elected 9 independent MPs over 11 to the Rada. The same year, voters in the region supported the incumbent [[Leonid Kravchuk]] over [[Leonid Kuchma]] by 70.5%
At the [[1998 Ukrainian parliamentary election]], Transcarpathia turned out to be one of the strongholds (together with Kyiv and L'viv) of [[Viktor Medvedchuk]]'s [[Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (united)]], which back then ran on a moderate [[Ukrainian nationalist]] ideology.
One year later, at the [[1999 Ukrainian presidential election|Presidential elections]], Transcarpathian voters supported the re-election of [[Leonid Kuchma]] by 85%.

At the [[2002 Ukrainian parliamentary election]], voters from Transcapathia supported the [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine Bloc]], in line with voters from all Western Ukraine. 
At the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election]], Transcarpathians voted in majority for [[Viktor Yushchenko]].
At the [[2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election]], voters from Transcapathia supported the [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine Bloc]] and the [[Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc]], in line with voters in Ciscarpatian East Galizia.
At the [[2007 Ukrainian parliamentary election]], the [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc]] linked with former President [[Viktor Yushchenko]] won in most of the region, while the [[Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc]] came out first in [[Uzhhorod]] and its raion.

The oblast is known as the birthplace of many prominent Ukrainian scientists, artists and stage performers. The region is considered a major area for organizing and holding international and national scientific and artistic forums. There are four accredited state universities in the oblast as well as a number of secondary schools, including nine recently established educational institutions, intended specifically to promote the language and cultural education of national minorities. The oblast also has five professional theaters, 659 clubs and leisure centers, museums, and a regional philharmonic. The oblast is also known for its cinema.

At that time, Uzhhorod residents could watch movies in two places: on Lajos Kossuth Square (now Sandor Petofi Square), and, since 1911, in the Korona Hotel. Many film actors and directors came from the region, including Shari Fedak, Vyacheslav Bihun, Jack Gaffrein, Alta Vashova, Antonin Moskalyk, Ludvik Raza, Mykhailo Fitz, Anastasia Yevtushenko, Beila Shalamon, Rudolph Dzurynets, Urai Tivodar, Antonio Lukic, Yevhen Yanovich, Stephen Gerey, and Dyula Chortosh.

On 18 July 2020, the number of raions (districts) was reduced to six.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Про утворення та ліквідацію районів. Постанова Верховної Ради України № 807-ІХ.|url=http://www.golos.com.ua/article/333466|access-date=2020-10-03|date=2020-07-18|website=Голос України|language=uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Нові райони: карти + склад |date=17 July 2020 |url=https://www.minregion.gov.ua/press/news/novi-rajony-karty-sklad/ |publisher=Міністерство розвитку громад та територій України |language=Ukrainian}}</ref>

Zakarpattia Oblast was previously subdivided into 13 [[raions]] ([[district]]s), as well as 5 cities ([[municipality|municipalities]]) which are directly subordinate to the oblast government: [[Berehove]] (Beregszász), [[Chop, Ukraine|Chop]] (Csap), [[Khust]], [[Mukachevo]], and the administrative centre of the oblast, [[Uzhhorod]]. There are a total of [[List of cities in Zakarpattia Oblast|11 cities]], [[List of urban-type settlements in Ukraine#Kyiv Oblast|19 towns]], and more than 579 villages.

[[File:Berehove4.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Berehove]]]]

Zakarpattia Oblast incorporates four unofficial geographic-historic regions (counties): [[Ung county|Ung]], [[Bereg (county)|Bereg]], [[Ugocsa]] and [[Northern Maramureș]]. There is a project for a reform of the current administrative division of the Oblast<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zakarpat-rada.gov.ua/proekt_reform.php|title=Admin. div. reform|website=Zakarpat-rada-gov.ua|access-date=9 March 2022|archive-date=23 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723140007/http://zakarpat-rada.gov.ua/proekt_reform.php|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Administrative centres of raions may be located within a city of regional importance, while such city is not technically a part of the raion.

Each raion is subdivided into radas (councils). Cities and towns (urban-type settlements) all have own individual councils, while villages and rural settlements may be formed into multiple settlements councils or an individual village council. A city of regional significance may consist of an individual populated place or be complex of several settlements (the city proper and suburbs) which are governed by their own rada (council). All cities are either of regional importance or of district importance.

==Symbols==
The [[coat of arms of Carpathian Ruthenia|coat of arms of Zakarpattia]] was originally created in the end of the 1920s in the then-Czechoslovakia. The oblast's flag was approved at the XXIII plenary session of the Transcarpathian Regional Council. The anthem of the Transcarpathian region is a folk musical work arranged by M. Keretsman to a poem attributed by some researchers to Oleksandr Dukhnovych, to the music of controversial Transcarpathian politician {{ill|Stepan Fentsyk|uk|Степан Фенцик}} (according to other sources, Stepan Fentsyk himself is the author of the words). The Transcarpathian Regional Council approved the anthem of the Transcarpathian region on 22 December 2009.
