Mudanjiang was originally populated by the [[Sushen]] 2,300 years ago.

Mudanjiang is named after the eponymous Mudan River (literally, "Peony River") flowing through it. [[Imperial Russia]] built a train station for the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] in Mudanjiang in 1903, after which local development started boosting. Both Chinese and Russian settlers established themselves here. Mudanjiang was little more than a large village until the 1920s. By that time, Mudanjiang was strongly overshadowed by the nearby county town of [[Ningan]] (Former [[Ninguta]]).<ref>{{Cite book|script-title=zh:雪城牡丹江 |author=牡丹江旅游局 [Mudanjiang Bureau of Tourism] |year=1990 |publisher=中国旅游出版社 [China Tourism Press] |isbn=978-7-5032-2302-0}}</ref> However, merchants from several countries including France, Russia, Britain and Denmark set up sub-agencies in Mudanjiang during this period, which led the trade area of the city to a rapid expansion.

After the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] began on September 19, 1931, the whole [[Manchuria]] was seized by Japan following the [[Mukden Incident]]. Mudanjiang experienced a substantial growth in the 1930s under the Japanese occupation. Mudanjiang also became a military and administrative center going by the name Botankou, particularly after the railway from Tumen to Jiamusi was constructed in 1933. By that time several light industries including light engineering, lumbering, and food processing was established in the town. On December 1, 1937, Botankou City was established by the [[Manchukuo]] government, administering five counties. On October 15, 1938, Japanese Government set up a consulate in Botankou and promoted Botankou as a municipality directly under the Manchukuo Government. As Manchukuo collapsed, Mudanjiang [[Battle of Mutanchiang|was captured]] by the [[Soviet Army]] on August 16, 1945.<ref name="Glantz">LTC David M.

Mudanjiang was controlled by the Communist forces and became the capital of [[Songjiang Province]] in 1948. However, after Songjiang Province was merged into Heilongjiang Province on June 19, 1954, Mudanjiang was reduced to a prefecture-level city. The historic [[Beishan Stadium]] is located in the city. The 15,000-capacity stadium is used mostly for association football matches.

Mudanjiang, spanning from 128° 02' to 131° 18' E longitude and 43° 24' to 45° 59' N latitude, is located in southeastern Heilongjiang province. It is also the province's southernmost prefecture. Neighboring prefectures are:
*[[Harbin]] (W)
*[[Jixi]] (NE)
*[[Qitaihe]] (N)
*[[Yanbian]], [[Jilin]] (S)
It also borders Russia's [[Primorsky Krai]] to the east. The average elevation in the prefecture is {{convert|230|m|0|sp=us}}, with the terrain primarily consisting of mountains and hills. The east of the prefecture begins to ascend to the [[Changbai Mountains]], while the central parts belong to the Hegu Basin. The lowest part of the prefecture is Suifenhe City, bordering Russia, at a minimum elevation of {{convert|86.5|m|1|sp=us}}, while the highest point is [[Zhangguangcai]] mountain, at {{convert|1686.9|m|sp=us}}.

===Climate===
Mudanjiang features a [[monsoon]]-influenced, [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dwa'') with hot, humid summers and very cold and dry winters; spring and autumn are brief. However, winter temperatures here are far warmer than much of the rest of the province, and the city's basin location helps protect it from biting winds. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from {{convert|−16.7|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|22.3|°C|1}} in July; the annual mean is {{convert|4.78|°C|1}}. Close to three-fifths of the annual rainfall occurs from June to August. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 46% in July to 62% in February and March, the city receives 2,368 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extreme temperatures have ranged from {{convert|−35.1|°C|0}} to {{convert|38.4|°C|0}}.
