'''Innsbruck''' ({{IPA|de|ˈɪnsbʁʊk|lang|De-Innsbruck.ogg}}; {{langx|bar|Innschbruck|label=[[Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian]]}} {{IPA|bar|ˈɪnʃprʊk|}}) is the capital of [[Tyrol (federal state)|Tyrol]] and the [[List of cities and towns in Austria|fifth-largest city]] in [[Austria]]. On the [[Inn (river)|River Inn]], at its junction with the [[Wipptal|Wipp Valley]], which provides access to the [[Brenner Pass]] {{convert|30|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the south, it had a population of 132,493 in 2018.

In the broad valley between high mountains, the so-called North Chain in the [[Karwendel Alps]] ([[Hafelekarspitze]], {{Convert|2334|m|ft|0|disp=or}}) to the north and [[Patscherkofel]] ({{Convert|2246|m|ft|0|disp=or |abbr=on}}) and [[Serles]] ({{Convert|2718|m|ft|0|disp=or |abbr=on}}) to the south, Innsbruck is an internationally renowned [[winter sports]] centre; it hosted the [[1964 Winter Olympics|1964]] and [[1976 Winter Olympics]] as well as the [[1984 Winter Paralympics|1984]] and [[1988 Winter Paralympics]]. It also hosted the first [[2012 Winter Youth Olympics|Winter Youth Olympics]] in 2012. The name means "bridge over the Inn".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/austria/tirol/innsbruck/history|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130918142958/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/austria/tirol/innsbruck/history|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 September 2013|title=History of Innsbruck – Lonely Planet Travel Information|first=Lonely|last=Planet|website=lonelyplanet.com}}</ref>

== History ==
===Antiquity===
The earliest traces suggest initial inhabitation in the early [[Stone Age]]. Surviving [[Ancient Rome|pre-Roman]] place names show that the area has been populated continuously. In the 4th century the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] established the army station Veldidena (the name survives in today's urban district Wilten) at '''Oenipons''' (Innsbruck), to protect the economically important commercial road from [[Verona]]-[[Brenner, South Tyrol|Brenner]]-[[Augsburg]] in their province of [[Raetia]].

The first mention of Innsbruck dates back to the name ''Oeni Pontum'' or ''Oeni Pons'' which is [[Latin]] for bridge (pons) over the Inn (Oenus), which was an important crossing point over the Inn river. The Counts of [[County of Andechs|Andechs]] acquired the town in 1180.<ref> {{citation|surname1=Martin Bitschnau, Hannes Obermair|title=Tiroler Urkundenbuch, II.

}}</ref> In 1248 the town passed into the hands of the [[County of Tyrol|Counts of Tyrol]].<ref>Chizzali. ''Tyrol: Impressions of Tyrol''. (Innsbruck: Alpina Printers and Publishers), p. 5.</ref> The city's arms show a bird's-eye view of the Inn bridge, a design used since 1267. The route over the [[Brenner Pass]] was then a major transport and communications link between the north and the south of Europe, and the easiest route across the [[Alps]]. It was part of the [[Via Imperii]], a medieval imperial road under special protection of the king. The revenues generated by serving as a transit station on this route enabled the city to flourish.

===Early history===
[[File:Albrecht Dürer - View of Innsbruck - WGA7356.jpg|thumb|left|''View of Innsbruck'' by [[Albrecht Dürer]], 1495 (from the North)]]
Innsbruck became the capital of all Tyrol in 1429 and in the 15th century the city became a centre of European politics and culture as Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] also resided in Innsbruck in the 1490s. The city benefited from the emperor's presence as can be seen for example in the [[Hofkirche, Innsbruck|Hofkirche]]. Here a funeral monument for Maximilian was planned and erected partly by his successors. The ensemble with a [[cenotaph]] and the bronze statues of real and mythical ancestors of the [[Habsburg|Habsburg emperor]] are one of the main artistic monuments of Innsbruck. A regular postal service between Innsbruck and [[Mechelen]] was established in 1490 by the [[Thurn-und-Taxis-Post]].

[[File:Schloß Ambras (Merian).jpg|thumb|[[Ambras Castle]], 1679]]
In 1564 [[Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria]] received the rulership over [[Tyrol]] and other [[Further Austria]]n possessions administered from Innsbruck up to the 18th century. He had [[Schloss Ambras]] built and arranged there his unique Renaissance collections nowadays mainly part of Vienna's [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]]. Up to 1665 a [[wikt:stirps#Noun|stirps]] of the Habsburg dynasty ruled in Innsbruck with an independent court. In the 1620s the first opera house north of the Alps was erected in Innsbruck (Dogana).

The university was founded in 1669. Also as a compensation for the court as Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] again reigned from Vienna and the Tyrolean stirps of the Habsburg dynasty had ended in 1665.{{clarify|date=July 2015}}

[[File:Franz von Defregger 001.jpg|thumb|left|''Andreas Hofer with his Consultants at the Hofburg'' by [[Franz Defregger]], 1879]]
During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] Tyrol was ceded to [[Bavaria]], ally of France. [[Andreas Hofer]] led a Tyrolean peasant army to victory in the [[Battles of Bergisel]] against the combined Bavarian and French forces, and then made Innsbruck the centre of his administration. The combined army later overran the Tyrolean [[militia]] army and until 1814 Innsbruck was part of Bavaria. After the [[Vienna Congress]] Austrian rule was restored. Until 1918, the town (one of the 4 autonomous towns in Tyrol) was part of the [[Austrian monarchy]] (Austria side after the [[compromise of 1867]]), head of the district of the same name, one of the 21 ''Bezirkshauptmannschaften'' in the [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] province.<ref>Wilhelm Klein (1967), ''Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den österreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890''.</ref>

The Tyrolean hero [[Andreas Hofer]] was executed in Mantua; his remains were returned to Innsbruck in 1823 and interred in the Franciscan church.

Innsbruck played a part during the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|revolution of 1848 in Austria]]. In May of that year, riots in Vienna made Emperor [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand]] to move the seat of government temporarily to that city.

During World War I, the only recorded action taking place in Innsbruck was near the end of the war. On 20 February 1918, Allied planes flying out of Italy raided Innsbruck, causing casualties among the Austrian troops there. No damage to the town is recorded.<ref>Reynolds, Churchill, et al. ''The Story of the Great War'', vol. 14. (New York: Collier and Son, 1919)</ref> In November 1918 Innsbruck and all Tyrol were occupied by the 20 to 22 thousand soldiers of the III Corps of the First Italian Army.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.agiati.it/UploadDocs/12255_Art_20_di_michele.pdf |title=Trento, Bolzano e Innsbruck: l'occupazione militare italiana del tirolo (1918–1920) |access-date=22 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822222302/http://www.agiati.it/UploadDocs/12255_Art_20_di_michele.pdf |archive-date=22 August 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1929, the first official [[Austrian Chess Championship]] was held in Innsbruck.

===Annexation and World War II===
{{Main|Bombing of Innsbruck in World War II}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2005-0923-505, Innsbruck, Annexion Österreichs.jpg|thumb|Some residents of Innsbruck with swastika flags welcomed the German troops after [[Anschluss]] on March 13, 1938]]
In 1938 Austria was annexed by [[Nazi Germany]] in the ''[[Anschluss]]''. During [[World War II]], Innsbruck was the location of two subcamps of the [[Dachau concentration camp]], including a special camp for prominent people from 16 countries and their families, who were held as hostages, including former [[Prime Minister of France]] [[Léon Blum]], former [[regent of Hungary]] [[Miklós Horthy]], former Chancellor of Austria [[Kurt Schuschnigg]], Italian general [[Giuseppe Garibaldi II]] and a nephew of [[Winston Churchill]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Megargee|first=Geoffrey P.|year=2009|title=The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos 1933–1945. Volume I|publisher=Indiana University Press, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|pages=484–485|isbn=978-0-253-35328-3}}</ref> Between 1943 and April 1945, Innsbruck experienced twenty-two [[strategic bombing during World War II|air raids]] and suffered heavy damage.

===Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino===
In 1996, the European Union approved further cultural and economic integration between the Austrian province of [[Tyrol (federal state)|Tyrol]] and the Italian autonomous provinces of [[South Tyrol]] and [[Trentino]] by recognizing the creation of the [[Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino]].

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Innsbruck has a [[humid continental]] climate ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb'') using {{convert|0|C}} isotherm or [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'') using the original {{convert|-3|C}} isotherm<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.innsbruck.climatemps.com/|title=Innsbruck Climate & Temperature|website=innsbruck.climatemps.com}}</ref> since it has larger annual temperature differences than most of Central Europe due to its location in the centre of the Continent and its position around mountainous terrains. Winters are often very cold (colder than those of most major European cities) and snowy, although the [[foehn wind]] sometimes brings pronounced thaws.

Spring is brief; days start to get warm, often over {{convert|15|°C|°F}}, but nights remain cool or even freezing.

Summer is highly variable and unpredictable. Days can be cool {{convert|17|°C|°F}} and rainy, or sunny and extremely hot, sometimes hitting {{convert|34|°C|°F}}. In summer, as expected for an alpine-influenced climate, the [[diurnal temperature variation]] is often very high as nights usually remain cool, being {{convert|12|°C|°F}} on average, but sometimes dipping as low as {{convert|6|°C|°F}}.

The average annual temperature is {{convert|9|°C|°F}}.

===Boroughs and statistical divisions===
[[File:Karte Innsbruck - Katastralgemeinden und Statistische Stadtteile.png|thumb|Cadastral settlements (red) and wards (grey) of Innsbruck]]
Innsbruck is divided into nine boroughs (cadastral settlements) that were formed from previously independent municipalities or villages.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Landesrecht Tirol: Stadtrecht der Landeshauptstadt Innsbruck 1975 § 2|publisher=Rechts Informations System (RIS), Bundeskanzleramt Österreich|url=http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokument.wxe?Abfrage=LrT&Dokumentnummer=LTI40032695|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140608162815/http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokument.wxe?Abfrage=LrT&Dokumentnummer=LTI40032695|archive-date=8 June 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> These nine boroughs are further divided into twenty wards (cadastral districts). All wards are within one borough, except for the ward of Hungerburg (Upper Innsbruck), which is divided between two. For statistical purposes, Innsbruck is further divided into forty-two statistical units (''Statistischer Bezirk'') and 178 numbered blocks (''Zählsprengel'').<ref>{{Cite web|title=Räumliches Bezugssystem: Referat Statistik und Berichtswesen, Innsbruck |publisher=Landeshauptstadt Innsbruck |url=http://www.innsbruck.gv.at/page.cfm?vpath=verwaltung/statistiken--zahlen/raeumliches-bezugssystem |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201214425/http://www.innsbruck.gv.at/page.cfm?vpath=verwaltung%2Fstatistiken--zahlen%2Fraeumliches-bezugssystem |archive-date=1 February 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Sports ===
[[File:BergiselInnsbruck2.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Bergisel]]schanze ski jumping facility]]
Due to its location between high mountains, Innsbruck serves as an ideal place for [[skiing]] in winter, [[ski-jumping]] and [[mountaineering]] in summer. There are several [[ski resorts]] around Innsbruck, with the [[Nordkette]] served by a cable car and additional chair lifts further up. Other ski resorts nearby include [[Axamer Lizum]], [[Muttereralmbahn|Muttereralm]], [[Patscherkofel]], Igls, [[Seefeld, Tirol|Seefeld]], [[Tulfes]] and [[Stubaital|Stubai]] Valley. The glaciated terrain in the latter makes skiing possible even in summer months.

The [[Winter Olympic Games]] were held in Innsbruck twice, first in [[1964 Winter Olympics|1964]], then again in [[1976 Winter Olympics|1976]], when [[Colorado]] voters rejected a bond referendum in 1972 to finance the [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] games, originally awarded in 1970. The [[1976 Winter Olympics]] were the last games held in the German-speaking [[Alps]] (Austria, Germany, or Switzerland).

Along with [[St. Moritz]], Switzerland and [[Lake Placid, New York]] in the United States, it is one of three places which have twice hosted the Winter Games. It also hosted the [[1984 Winter Paralympics|1984]] and [[1988 Winter Paralympics]].

Innsbruck hosted the [[2012 Winter Youth Olympics|1st Winter Youth Olympic Games]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/news/olympic_news/full_story_uk.asp?id=2890 |title=International Olympic Committee – News |publisher=Olympic.org |access-date=5 May 2009}}</ref>

Other notable events held in Innsbruck include the [[Air & Style|Air & Style Snowboard Contest]] from 1994 to 1999 and 2008 and the [[Ice Hockey World Championships|Ice Hockey World Championship]] in 2005. Together with the city of [[Seefeld, Tirol|Seefeld]], Innsbruck organized the Winter [[Universiade]] in 2005. Innsbruck's [[Bergiselschanze]] is one of the hills of the famous [[Four Hills Tournament]].

Innsbruck is home to [[association football|football]] clubs [[WSG Tirol]] and [[FC Wacker Tirol|FC Wacker Innsbruck]], who play in the [[Austrian Football Bundesliga|Austrian Bundesliga]] and the [[Austrian Landesliga]] respectively. Former teams include the [[FC Swarovski Tirol]] and [[FC Tirol Innsbruck]]. The teams' stadium, [[Tivoli Neu]], is one of eight stadiums which hosted [[Euro 2008]], which took place in Switzerland and Austria in June 2008.

The city is home to the American football team [[Raiders Tirol]]. Innsbruck hosted an American football final, [[Eurobowl]] XXII between the [[Swarco Raiders Tirol]] and the [[Raiffeisen Vikings Vienna]].

The city hosted opening round games in the [[2011 IFAF World Championship]], the official international [[American Football]] championship.

[[File:12-06-05-innsbruck-by-ralfr-165.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Innsbruck Airport]]
Innsbruck is located along the A12/A13 highway corridor ([[Inn Valley Autobahn]] and [[Brenner Autobahn]] respectively), providing freeway access to [[Verona]], Italy and [[Munich]], Germany. The A12 and A13 converge near Innsbruck, at which point the A13 terminates.

[[Innsbruck Hauptbahnhof]], the most important railway station of Innsbruck and Tyrol, is one of the busiest railway stations in Austria. It is served by the [[Lower Inn Valley railway|Lower Inn Valley line]] to Germany and eastern Austria, the [[Arlberg railway|Arlberg line]] to the west and the [[Brenner railway|Brenner line]], which connects northern Italy with southern Germany via the [[Brenner Pass]]. Since December 2007 suburban services have been operated as the [[Innsbruck S-Bahn]].

[[Innsbruck Airport]] is located in the suburb of Kranebitten, which is located in the west of the city. It provides services to airports including [[Frankfurt]], [[London]], [[Amsterdam]] and [[Vienna]]. It also handles regional flights around the [[Alps]], as well as seasonal flights to other destinations. During the winter, activity increases significantly, due to the high number of skiers travelling to the region. The airport is approximately {{convert|4|km|mi|1}} from the centre of Innsbruck.

[[File:Trambahn in Innsbruck.jpg|thumb|left|Trambahn in Innsbruck]]
Local public transport is provided by Innsbrucker Verkehrsbetriebe (IVB), a public authority operating a network of bus and [[tram]] routes.  The metre-gauge [[Trams in Innsbruck|tram network]] consists of four city lines, 1, 2, 3 and 5, and two lines serving the surrounding area: {{nowrap|line 6}}, the Innsbrucker Mittelgebirgsbahn to Igls, and line ''STB'', the [[Stubaitalbahn]] running through the [[Stubaital|Stubai Valley]] to [[Fulpmes]]. The network is planned to be enlarged during the coming years to reach the neighboring village Rum in the east and [[Völs, Austria|Völs]] in the west. Numerous bus lines serve the inner city and connect it with surrounding areas. Until 2007 the bus network included two [[trolleybus]] routes, but these were abandoned in preparation for planned expansion of the tram network.

In December 2007, the [[Hungerburgbahn]], a [[funicular]] service to the district of Hungerburg, was reopened after a two-year closure for extensive rebuilding, with partial realignment and a new extension under the [[Inn River]] and into central Innsbruck.  The line was also equipped with new vehicles. Because of the unique design of the stations, drafted by the famous architect [[Zaha Hadid]], the funicular evolves immediately to a new emblem of the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.austria.info/au/basic-facts/special-recommendations/hungerburg-funicular|title=Hungerburgbahn Innsbruck}}</ref> The line was rebuilt by the Italian company Leitner, and can now carry up to 1,200 persons per hour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.leitner-ropeways.com/en/company/references/if130-hungerburgbahn-643/|title=IF130 Hungerburgbahn|access-date=25 August 2016|archive-date=12 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200112172711/https://www.leitner-ropeways.com/en/company/references/if130-hungerburgbahn-643/|url-status=dead}}</ref> It is operated by a private company, the 'Innsbrucker Nordkettenbahnen'.
