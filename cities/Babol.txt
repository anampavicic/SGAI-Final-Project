== History and etymology==
[[File:Bahman Square of Babol.jpg|thumb|left|Bahman Square Babol in 1946]]
Founded by the [[Safavids]] in the 16th century, it was built on the site of the ancient city of '''''Mamtir''''' (deriving from "Mah Mithra" "great [[Mithra]]). Mithra or 'The Mediator' was believed to be the savior of creation from the threat of darkness and the one who stands between the light of [[Ahura Mazda]] and the darkness of Ahriman. ''Babol'' was formerly called ''Barforushdeh'' (meaning Market Town) and Barforush afterwards. In 1931, the founder of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] [[Reza Shah]] (1878-1944) ordered urban planning efforts to commence in the city and changed its name to Babol, which means city with abundant water supply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babolcity.ir/HomePage.aspx?TabID=4618&Site=DouranPortal&Lang=fa-IR%7C|title=شهرداری بابل|website= Babol Municipality|language=fa}}</ref>
