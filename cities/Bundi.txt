[[File:Bundi palace.jpg | thumb | View of Bundi Fort and Palace from the Highway.]]

Stone Age tools dating from 5,000 to 2,00,000 years were found in [[Bundi district|Bundi]] and [[Bhilwara district|Bhilwara]] districts of the state.<ref>{{citation |last=Pillai |first=Geetha Sunil |title=Stone age tools dating back 2,00,000 years found in Rajasthan |url=https://m.timesofindia.com/city/udaipur/stone-age-tools-dating-back-200000-years-found-in-rajasthan/articleshow/57385393.cms |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=28 February 2017 }}</ref>

In ancient times, the area around Bundi was apparently inhabited by [[Meena]] tribe. Bundi derives its name from Bunda Meena. The Hada Rajputs took the town arround 1242 after diverting the rivulet as the location and terrain provided natural defensibility to their fortifications., renaming the surrounding region as Hadauti, the land of great [[Hada (clan)|Hada]] [[Rajputs]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}

The rulers of Bundi State belonged to Hada-Chauhan dynasty and have ruled the area since 1241 CE. Rao Devraj Singh Hada was the first ruler and presently 26th gaadipati is Brig HH Bhupesh Singh, SC, VSM.{{cn|date=June 2024}}

===Forts and palaces===
* [[Taragarh Fort, Bundi|Taragarh Fort]], or Star Fort, is the most impressive of the city's structures. It was constructed in 1354 on the top of a steep hillside overlooking the city. The largest of its [[battlement]]s is the 16th century [[bastion]] known as the ''Bhim Burj'', on which was once mounted a particularly large [[cannon]] called ''Garbh Gunjam'', or 'Thunder from the Womb'. The fort is a popular tourist viewpoint of the city below. The fort contains three tanks which never dry up. The technique with which they were built has been long since lost but the tanks survive as a testament to the advanced methods of construction and engineering in medieval India.{{cn|date=May 2018}}
* Bundi Palace is situated on the hillside adjacent to the Taragarh Fort and is notable for its lavish traditional [[mural]]s and [[fresco]]es. The ''Chitrashala'' (picture gallery) of the palace is open to the general public.{{cn|date=May 2018}}
* The [[Nawal Sagar Lake|Nawal Sagar]] is a large square-shaped artificial lake in the centre of Bundi containing many small islets. A temple dedicated to [[Varuna]], the [[Rigvedic deities|vedic god]] of water, stands half-submerged in the middle of the lake. the lake feeds the numerous bavdis in the old city by creating an artificial water table
* Sukh Mahal is a cream-coloured palace that sits on the water bank. [[Rudyard Kipling]] stayed there and claimed that the palace inspired his novel ''[[Kim (novel)|Kim]]''{{cn|date=May 2018}}
* [[Chaurasi Khambon ki Chhatri, Bundi]] or Eighty four pillared cenotaph
* Kedareshwar Shiv Temple was built by Meena King Kolhan Ushara arround 1016 AD.
* [[Jait Sagar Lake]] was made by Last Meena King Jaita Meena in 14th Century from Ushara clan of Meena tribe and grandson of Bunda Meena.
* Abhaynath Shiv Temple was built by Meena King Aabu Meena in mid-11th Century.

===Stepwells===
There are over 50 stepwells in Bundi, of which only a handful have been maintained. They used to be the only source of water for the town until a piped water system was introduced. After that, these stepwells were abandoned and the monuments fell into disrepair. Most of the former stepwells inside the town have become [[garbage dump|refuse dump]]s, and are slipping out of the public consciousness.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

The [[Raniji ki Baori]] is a noted and well-maintained stepwell, some {{convert|46|m}} deep. It was built in 1699 by Rani Nathavatji. The steps built into the sides of the water-well made water accessible even when at a very low level. The baori is one of the largest examples of its kind in Rajasthan.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

The [[Nagar Sagar Kund|Nagar Sagar twin step wells]] are identical step wells crafted in masonry on either side of the main spine of the town. The Dabhai Kund, also known as the Jail Kund, is the largest of the stepwells and, although slightly overgrown, still shows carvings on the numerous steps leading down to water level.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

===Murals===
Murals in the typical Rajasthani Hadoti miniature style are an important attraction in the Garh Palace. They cover the walls, ceilings and niches in several of the pavilions or "mahals", depicting stories from the life of [[Krishna]] as well as scenes from the lives of the royalty. They have significant artistic and decorative values. The Ummed Bhavan "Chitrashala" (also in the Garh Palace, i.e. the palace premises within the Bundi fort) have especially notable murals.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

===Rock art===
There are nearly 100 [[rock art]] sites in and around the town, some dating back 5000 to 7000 years. They have been discovered by a local enthusiast in the sandstone escarpments and [[Cave|caves]]. These show up the typical line drawings of wild buffalo, deer, tiger, etc. as well as humans in different postures that depict the typical lives and concerns of human beings of the period.{{cn|date=May 2018}}
