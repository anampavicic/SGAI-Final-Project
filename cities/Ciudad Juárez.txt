==History==
{{further|Timeline of Ciudad Juárez|History of El Paso, Texas}}

[[File:Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe de los Manso.jpg|thumb|left|A painting of the Guadalupe Mission in the 1850s.  The Presidio del Paso del Rio Norte can be seen to the right in the far background.]]
[[File:Juarez Cathedrale et mission 24-02-2007.jpg|right|thumb|Juárez mission and cathedral]]

As 17th-century Spanish explorers sought a route through the southern [[Rocky Mountains]], the Franciscan Friar García de San Francisco founded Ciudad Juárez in 1659 as "El Paso del Norte" ("The North Pass"). The [[Misión de Guadalupe de los Mansos en el Paso del río del Norte]] became the first permanent Spanish development in the area in the 1660s. The [[Franciscan]] friars established a community that grew in importance as commerce between Santa Fe and [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]] passed through it. The wood for the first bridge across the Rio Grande came from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], in the late 18th century. The original population of [[Mansos]], [[Suma-Jumano|Suma]], [[Jumano]], and other natives from the south brought by the Spanish from Central [[New Spain]] grew around the mission. In 1680 during the [[Pueblo Revolt]], most of the [[Piro Pueblo]] and some of the [[Tiwa Puebloans|Tiwa people]] branch of the [[Pueblo]] became refugees. A Mission was established for the Tigua in [[Ysleta, El Paso, Texas|Ysleta del Sur]]. Piro Pueblo colonial era settlements along El Camino Real, south of the Guadalupe Mission, included Missions [[San Lorenzo, Ciudad Juárez|Real de San Lorenzo]], [[Senecú, Ciudad Juárez|Senecú del Sur]], and [[Socorro, Texas|Soccoro del Sur]]. [[Presidio del Nuestra Senora del Pilar del Paso del Rio Norte]] was established near the Mission in 1683.<ref name=Torok>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=69auCgAAQBAJ |title=From the Pass to the Pueblos |first=George D. |last=Torok |date=December 1, 2011 |publisher=Sunstone Press |isbn=9780865348967 |via=Google Books |access-date=November 18, 2019 |archive-date=March 30, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230330081901/https://books.google.com/books?id=69auCgAAQBAJ |url-status=live }}</ref>{{rp|39–96}}

The population of the entire district was close to 5,000 in 1750 when the [[Apache]] attacked the other native towns and ranchos around the missions. Additional Presidios were established to counter them. One Presidio, San Elzeario, was established near [[El Porvenir, Chihuahua|El Porvenir]] in 1774, where it remained until being moved in 1788 to what is now [[San Elizario, Texas]], where that settlement grew up around that Presidio. Another was [[Presidio de San Fernando de Carrizal]], which was established in 1774 at the San Fernando settlement that became present-day [[Carrizal, Chihuahua]].<ref name=Torok/>{{rp|39–40}}

During the [[Mexican–American War]], the [[Battle of El Bracito]] took place nearby on Christmas Day, 1846. The 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] established the Rio Grande as the border between Mexico and the United States. The main channel of the Rio Grande had moved southwestward leaving the settlements of Ysleta, Socorro, and San Elzeario on the Camino Real on the north bank of the river, isolated from the rest of the towns, in Texas.

[[File:Monumento a Benito Juárez.JPG|thumb|left|[[Benito Juárez]] monument located in central Juárez]]

Other settlements on the east bank of the Rio Grande were not part of a town at that time; as the U.S. Army set up its installations settlements grew around it. This would later become El Paso, Texas. From that time until around 1930, populations on both sides of the border moved freely across it.{{citation needed||date=November 2023}}

In 1853, a new border adjustment occurred when the territory of La Mesilla was sold to the United States, with which the new border line after the Rio Grande began precisely in Paso del Norte, reinforcing its status as a border town.

During the [[Second French intervention in Mexico|French intervention in Mexico]] (1862–1867), [[Benito Juárez]]'s republican forces stopped temporarily at El Paso del Norte before establishing his [[government-in-exile]] in Chihuahua. After 1882, the city grew, in large part, because of the arrival of the Mexican Central Railway. Commerce thrived in the city as more banks began operating, telegraph and telephone services became available, and trams appeared. These commercial activities were under the firm control of the city's oligarchy, which consisted of the Ochoa, Samaniego, Daguerre, Provencio, and Cuarón families. In 1888, El Paso del Norte was renamed in honor of Benito Juárez.

===City expansion under Porfirio Díaz ===
The city expanded significantly thanks to [[Porfirio Díaz]]'s free-trade policy, creating a new retail and service sector along the old Calle del Comercio (now Vicente Guerrero) and September 16 Avenue. A bullring opened in 1899. The Escobar brothers founded the city's first institution of higher education in 1906, the Escuela Particular de Agricultura. That same year, a series of public works are inaugurated, including the city's sewage and drainage system, as well as potable water. A public library, schools, new public market (the old Mercado Cuauhtémoc) and parks dotted the city, making it one of many Porfirian showcases.{{clarify|date=September 2013}} 

Modern hotels and restaurants were built to cater the increased international railroad traffic from the 1880s onwards. However, national and foreign opposition to the "disloyal" commercial rivalry of the [[Zona Libre|free zone]] was not long in coming and the Mexican government was forced to modify the status of the free zone in 1891. To this must be added the worldwide devaluation of silver and [[water scarcity]], which generated a severe economic crisis in the city, causing a significant number of workers to flee to the United States. As a result of the collapse of commercial activities and population, Ciudad Juárez focused on tourism as an economic activity at the beginning of the 20th century, particularly promoting "diversions", thus beginning "the moment of scandal"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Flores Simental |first=Raúl |title=Paso del norte en el siglo XXI : breve historia de Ciudad Juárez |publisher=Universidad Autónoma de Ciudad Juárez |year=2017 |location=Ciudad Juarez |language=Spanish}}</ref>

[[File:Presidents Taft and Diaz, Oct. 1909.jpg|thumb|upright|Taft and Díaz, historic first presidential summit, Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, 1909]]

In 1909, Díaz and [[William Howard Taft]] planned a summit in Ciudad Juárez and El Paso, a historic first meeting between a Mexican and a U.S. president, and also the first time a U.S. president would cross the border into Mexico.{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=1}} But tensions rose on both sides of the border over the disputed [[Chamizal dispute|Chamizal strip]] connecting Ciudad Juárez to El Paso, even though it would have been considered neutral territory with no flags present during the summit.{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=14}} The [[Texas Rangers Division|Texas Rangers]], 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security.{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=15}} [[Frederick Russell Burnham]], the celebrated scout, was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by [[John Hays Hammond]].{{sfn|Hampton|1910}}{{sfn|van Wyk|2003|pp=440–446}} On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed [[Protector Palm Pistol|palm pistol]] standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route.{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=16}}{{sfn|Hammond|1935|pp=565-66}} Burnham and Moore captured, disarmed, and arrested the assassin within only a few feet of Díaz and Taft.{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=213}}{{sfn|Harris|2004|p=26}}

=== Mexican Revolution ===
The city was Mexico's largest border town by 1910. As such, it held strategic importance during the [[Mexican Revolution]]. In May 1911, about 3,000 revolutionary fighters under the leadership of [[Francisco I. Madero]] laid siege to Ciudad Juárez, which was garrisoned by 500 regular Federal troops under the command of General Juan José Navarro. Navarro's force was supported by 300 civilian auxiliaries and local police. After two days of heavy fighting most of the city had fallen to the insurrectionists and the surviving federal soldiers had withdrawn to their barracks. Navarro then formally surrendered to Madero. The capture of a key border town at an early stage of the revolution not only enabled the revolutionary forces to bring in weapons and supplies from El Paso, but marked the beginning of the end for the demoralized Diaz regime.<ref>{{cite book |first=Ronald |last=Aitkin |pages=85–90 |title=Mexico 1910-20 |publisher=Macmillan & Co |date=1969}}</ref>

During the subsequent years of the conflict, [[Pancho Villa]] and other revolutionaries struggled for the control of the town (and income from the Federal Customs House), destroying much of the city during battles in [[Battle of Ciudad Juárez (1911)|1911]] and 1913. Much of the population abandoned the city between 1914 and 1917. Tourism, gambling, and light manufacturing drove the city's recovery from the 1920s until the 1940s. A series of mayors in the 1940s–1960s, like Carlos Villareal and René Mascareñas Miranda, ushered in a period of high growth and development predicated on the PRONAF border industrialization development program. 

=== Beautification ===
A beautification program spruced up the city center, building a series of arched porticos around the main square, as well as neo-colonial façades for main public buildings such as the city health clinic, the central fire station, and city hall. The cathedral, built in the 1950s, gave the city center the flavor of central Mexico, with its carved towers and elegant dome, but structural problems required its remodeling in the 1970s. The city's population reached some 400,000 by 1970. In 1984, the city had a [[Ciudad Juárez cobalt-60 contamination incident|radiation incident]] after a private medical company illegally purchased a radiation therapy unit. It was dismantled, sold to a junkyard and later smelted to produce six thousand tons of [[rebar]] (which is used to reinforce buildings), exposing thousands to radiation.

[[File:PlazaDeLaMexicanidad.jpg|thumb|View of the Plaza de la Mexicanidad in north central Juárez]]

Juárez has grown substantially in recent decades due to a large influx of people moving into the city in search of jobs with the [[maquiladoras]]. {{As of | 2014}} more technological firms have moved to the city, such as the [[Delphi Corporation]] Technical Center, the largest in the Western Hemisphere, which employs over 2,000 engineers. Large [[slum|slum housing]] communities called ''[[colonia (border settlement)|colonias]]'' have become extensive.

Juárez has a long, notorious history of [[drug trafficking]] and the intense related violence.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7682465.stm "Human heads sent to Mexico police"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728033147/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7682465.stm |date=July 28, 2011 }}, ''BBC News'', October 21, 2008.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Due to its location in the [[Chihuahuan Desert]] and high altitude, Ciudad Juárez has a [[cold desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''[[BWk]]'').

Ciudad Juárez has many affluent neighborhoods, such as [[Campestre (Ciudad Juárez)|Campestre]], Campos Elíseos, and Misión de Los Lagos. Other neighborhoods, including [[Anapra]], [[Chaveña]], and Anáhuac, would be considered more marginal, while the remaining neighborhoods in Juárez represent the middle- to working-class, for example, Infonavit, Las Misiones, Valle de Juárez, Lindavista, Altavista, Guadalajara, Galeana, Flores Magón, Mariano Escobedo, Los Nogales, and Independencia.

Between the 1960s and 1990s, Juárez saw a high level of population growth due in part to the newly established maquiladoras. The end of the [[Bracero Program]] also brought workers back from border cities in the U.S. through Ciudad Juárez, contributing to the growing number of citizens.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Boudreaux |first=Corrie |title=Public Memorialization and the Grievability of Victims in Ciudad Juárez |url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=02526bdd-f315-47be-a518-380a18ee6b84%40sessionmgr4009&vid=0&hid=4109&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=118882351&db=a9h |journal=Social Research |volume=83 |issue=2}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Along with rapid industrialization, small brick kilns have been a big contributor to the high amount of air pollution in Ciudad Juárez.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Blackman |first1=A. |last2=Bannister |first2=G. |title=Pollution Control in the Informal Sector: The Ciudad Juarez Brickmakers' Project |journal=Natural Resources Journal |volume=37 |issue=4}}</ref> While the Ciudad Juárez economy has largely been dependent on Maquiladora program, business leaders have undertaken initiatives to upskill and secure the city are larger stake in the global manufacturing economy.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Simon |title=Reporter |url=https://www.marketplace.org/2017/10/20/looking-for-tech-innovators-mexicos-ciudad-juarez/ |website=American Public Media: Marketplace morning report |date=October 20, 2017 |publisher=American Public Media |access-date=June 30, 2019 |archive-date=July 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701171559/https://www.marketplace.org/2017/10/20/looking-for-tech-innovators-mexicos-ciudad-juarez/ |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Technology Hub]] is a business incubator that works with regionally based companies, on programs in skill development, and the transition into automation and industry 4.0.<ref>{{cite web |title=Technology Hub media |url=https://t-hub.mx/en/industria |website=Technology Hub |access-date=July 1, 2019 |archive-date=June 23, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190623130346/https://t-hub.mx/en/industria |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Transportation==
===Public bus system===
The main public transportation system in the city is the public bus system. The public buses run the main streets of Ciudad Juárez throughout the day, costing eight pesos (less than 40 cents) to ride one. Due to the aging current bus fleet being considered potentially outdated, the municipal government is working on replacing the buses with new ones, along with improving the bus stops,  by equipping them with shade.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The ViveBus [[bus rapid transit]] (BRT) system opened to the public in November 2013 with the first route of five planned. The project was made a reality with the collaboration of the local municipal government, the private enterprise of Integradora de Transporte de Juárez (INTRA) as well as other city government agencies.  Studies have shown that the current bus system averages {{cvt|8|mph|0|disp=flip}} while the new system is projected to average {{cvt|16|mph|0|disp=flip}}.  The BRT system studies conducted by the Instituto Municipal de Investigacion Y Planeacion project a daily ridership of 40,000.

The first of the five routes opened to users in late 2013 and is officially named Presidencia-Tierra Nueva and has 34 stations distributed along the north to south corridor.  The route starts at Avenida Francisco Villa, follows north to Eje Vial Norte-Sur then veers left at Zaragoza Blvd. and ends at Avenida Independencia and the elevated Carretera Federal 2.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The first bridge to cross the Rio Grande at El Paso del Norte was built in the time of [[New Spain]], over 250 years ago, from wood hauled in from Santa Fe.<ref>Paul Horgan, ''Great River: The Rio Grande in North American History''. Volume 1, Indians and Spain. Vol. 2, Mexico and the United States. 2 Vols. in 1, 1038 pages – Wesleyan University Press 1991, 4th Reprint, {{ISBN|0-8195-6251-3}}</ref>  Today, this bridge is honored by the modern [[Paso del Norte International Bridge|Santa Fe Street Bridge]], and Santa Fe Street in downtown El Paso.

Several bridges serve the El Paso–Ciudad Juárez area in addition to the Paso Del Norte Bridge also known as the Santa Fe Street Bridge, including the [[Bridge of the Americas (El Paso–Ciudad Juárez)|Bridge of the Americas]], [[Stanton Street Bridge]], and the [[Ysleta–Zaragoza International Bridge|Ysleta Bridge also known as the Zaragoza Bridge]].
