The city's administrative region includes the ten metropolitan [[district (China)|district]]s of Shenyang, the [[county-level city]] of [[Xinmin, Liaoning|Xinmin]], and the [[counties of the People's Republic of China|counties]] of [[Kangping County|Kangping]] and [[Faku County|Faku]].

Shenyang has been controlled by numerous different states and peoples during its history. In the 14th century, the city came under the control of the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644), for whom it served as an important military stronghold. The 1621 [[Battle of Shen-Liao]] resulted in Shenyang briefly serving as the capital of the Jurchen [[Later Jin (1616–1636)|Later Jin]] dynasty, the direct predecessor of the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912).<ref name=Ebrey2010pp220224/> The 1905 [[Battle of Mukden]] took place south of Shenyang as part of the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. The subsequent Japanese victory allowed its annexation of the region west of the old city and the increase of Japanese influence in Shenyang. In 1931, the [[Mukden incident]] led to the Japanese invasion and occupation of the rest of Northeast China, and the establishment of the puppet state of [[Manchukuo]]. After the [[Japanese surrender]] in 1945, Shenyang remained a stronghold of the [[Kuomintang]] until its capture by the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communists]] in 1948 following the [[Liaoshen campaign]].

==Name==
''Shenyang'' literally means "the ''[[yin and yang|yang]]'' side of the Shen River" and refers to the location of the [[Hun River (Liao River tributary)|Hun River]] (formerly called the Shen River, {{zh|t=瀋水|p=Shěn Shuǐ|labels=no}}), on the southern side of the city.  According to Chinese naming tradition, a river's north bank and a mountain's south slope are angled more towards direct sunlight and thus are considered the "sunny", or "yang", side.<ref name="理论界">{{cite journal |author=顾奎相 |date=January 2013 |script-title=zh:沈阳名称由来考——因"沈水"而得名,非"合成"说 |script-journal=zh:《理论界》 |issue=1}}</ref>

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Xinle Civilisation Shenyang China.JPG|thumb|left|Xinle Ruins]]
Archaeological findings show that humans resided in present-day Shenyang as early as 8000&nbsp;years ago. The remains of the [[Xinle culture]], a late [[Neolithic period]] society over 6800–7200&nbsp;years old,<ref name=":1">''Archaeology of Asia'', pp.&nbsp;129</ref> are located in a museum in the north part of [[Huanggu District]]. It is complemented by a recreated village on site.

The city now known as Shenyang was first established {{circa|300&nbsp;BCE}} during the [[Warring States period]] by [[Yan (state)|Yan]] general [[Qin Kai (general)|Qin Kai]], who conquered the [[Liaodong]] region from [[Gojoseon]].<ref>{{cite book |language=zh |author=陈寿 |script-title=zh:三国志·魏志·东夷传 |year=2000 |publisher=浙江古籍出版社 |script-quote=zh:昔萁子之后北朝鲜侯，自称为王，后子孙稍骄虐，燕乃遣将秦开，攻其西方，取地两千余里，至满番汗为界，朝鲜遂弱。}}</ref> It was then named Hou City ({{zhi|t=侯城|p=Hóu Chéng}}). Around 350 years later, during the reign of [[Emperor Guangwu of Han]], the city was sacked and burnt by the [[Donghu people|Donghu]] nomads and subsequently abandoned. The area of modern Shenyang was divided between two [[commandery (China)|commanderies]] called [[Liaodong Commandery|Liaodong]] and [[Xuantu Commandery|Xuantu]] {{circa|107&nbsp;CE|lk=no}}. Liaodong was seized by a Han governor in 189. Liaodong and Xuantu were briefly united under [[Cao Wei]] and the [[Jin dynasty (266–420)]]. The region was in disarray during the fourth century until the [[Goguryeo]] occupied both commanderies in 404. Under Goguryeo, the city was called Gaemo. They established the cities of Xuantucheng and Gaimoucheng in the region. The [[Sui dynasty]] recaptured the area and established a new Liaodong Commandery in what is now modern Shenyang. In 645, the [[Tang dynasty]] [[Goguryeo–Tang War|invaded Goguryeo]] and captured Xuantucheng and Gaimoucheng. Soon after, Liaodong was administratively reorganized and enjoyed nearly 250 years of stability and development.<ref>{{Cite book |title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania |publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn |year=1996 |isbn=1-884964-04-4 |editor-last=Schellinger |editor-first=Paul |location=Chicago |pages=744 |editor-last2=Salkin |editor-first2=Robert}}</ref>

In 916, the Shenyang region was captured by the [[Liao dynasty]] and was known as Shen Prefecture ({{zhi|t=瀋州|p=Shěn Zhōu}}) until the end of [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] (who conquered the region in 1116). The area became known as the Shenyang Circuit ({{zhi|t=瀋陽路|p=Shěnyáng Lù}}) during the [[Yuan dynasty]].<ref name="中国网沈阳历史">{{cite web |url=http://www.china.com.cn/city/zhuanti/07lnx/2007-06/07/content_8357641.htm |script-title=zh:沈阳历史 |script-website=zh:中国网 |access-date=2014-05-29 |language=zh |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318032642/http://www.china.com.cn/city/zhuanti/07lnx/2007-06/07/content_8357641.htm |archive-date=2013-03-18 |url-status=live}}</ref> After the fall of the Yuan, Shenyang came under the control of the [[Ming dynasty]], and it was designated a guard town named Shenyang Central Guard ({{zhi|t=瀋陽中衛|p=Shěnyáng Zhōngwèi}}). During the Ming dynasty, Shenyang became one of the most important Chinese military strongholds beyond the [[Shanhai Pass]].

In 1625, the Jurchen leader [[Nurhaci]] [[Battle of Shen-Liao|captured Shenyang from the Ming]] and decided to relocate his entire administrative infrastructures to the city, which was then called {{tlit|mnc|Simiyan}} hoton ({{Lang-mnc|m={{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᠰᡳᠮᡳᠶᠠᠨ <br />ᡥᠣᡨᠣᠨ}}}})in the [[Manchu language]], Simiyan itselt being the Manchu's homophonic translation of the Korean's rendering of the name Shenyang (심양).<ref name=Ebrey2010pp220224>{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of China |first=Patricia |last=Ebrey |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-521-12433-1 |pages=220–224}}</ref> The official name was changed to Mukden ({{Lang-mnc|m={{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc| ᠮᡠᡴᡩᡝᠨ}}}}), or Shengjing ({{zhi|t=盛京|p=Shèng Jīng|l=rising capital}}) in 1634.  The new name derives from the [[Manchu]] word, {{tlit|mnc|mukdembi}} ({{Lang-mnc|m={{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᠮᡠᡴᡩᡝᠮᠪᡳ}}}}), meaning 'to rise' as reflected also by its Han Chinese name.<ref name="盛京史话"/>  Under [[Nurhaci]]'s orders, the [[Mukden Palace|Imperial Palace]] was constructed in 1626, symbolizing the city's emerging status as the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] political center.  The palace featured more than 300 ostentatiously decorated rooms and 20 gardens as a symbol of power and grandeur.<ref name="盛京史话">{{cite web |url=http://www.lndangan.gov.cn/lnsdaj/jcln/msmf/content/4028eaa228fb517a0128fb557fae1891.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233938/http://www.lndangan.gov.cn/lnsdaj/jcln/msmf/content/4028eaa228fb517a0128fb557fae1891.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-12-02 |script-title=zh:盛京城史话 |publisher=辽宁省档案信息网 |access-date=2014-05-28 |language=zh}}</ref>

After the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644 and the routing of the [[Shun dynasty|Shun]] army in the [[Battle of Shanhai Pass]] just a day later, the Manchus successfully entered the [[Shanhai Pass]] to establish the [[Qing dynasty]] in [[China proper]]. The capital was subsequently relocated from Shenyang to [[Beijing]]. However, Shenyang retained considerable importance as the secondary capital and spiritual home of the [[Qing dynasty]] through the centuries.<ref name="盛京史话"/> Treasures of the royal house were kept at its palaces, and the tombs of the early Qing rulers were once among the most famous monuments in China. In 1657, Fengtian Prefecture ({{zhi|t=奉天府|p=Fèngtiān Fǔ}}; {{Lang-mnc|m={{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᠠᠪᡴᠠᡳ <br />ᡳᠮᡳᠶᠠᠩᡤᠠ <br />ᡶᡠ}}|v=abkai imiyangga fu|a=abkai imiyangga fu}} or {{Lang-mnc|m={{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᡶᡠᠩ ᡨᡳᠶᠠᠨ}}|v=fung tiyian|a=fung tiyian}}) was established in the Shenyang area, and Fengtian was sometimes used synonymously with Shenyang/Mukden.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cathay.ce.cn/history/201005/14/t20100514_21397914.shtml |script-title=zh:三陵巷 三陵衙门和盛京将军 |script-work=zh:中国经济网 |access-date=2013-05-01 |language=zh |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515132813/http://cathay.ce.cn/history/201005/14/t20100514_21397914.shtml |archive-date=2013-05-15}}</ref>

===Russian and Japanese influence===
[[File:Map of Shenyang in 1919.jpg|thumb|Japanese-administered zone (orange) and the old Shenyang city (violet) in 1919]]
After the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894-1895, [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] coerced the annexation of the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] with the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] in 1895, but had to give it up due to diplomatic pressure from the 1895 [[Triple Intervention]].  In the aftermath of the Japanese threat, [[Qing China|Qing]] viceroy [[Li Hongzhang]] visited Moscow in 1896 and [[Li–Lobanov Treaty|signed a secret treaty]] with Russian foreign minister [[Aleksey Lobanov-Rostovsky]], allowing the [[Russian Empire]] to build [[Chinese Eastern Railway|a Russian-gauge railway]] through Manchuria, which opened the door towards further Russian expansionism in the form of [[Convention for the Lease of the Liaotung Peninsula|another lease convention in 1898]], effectively allowing Russia to annex [[Lüshunkou District|Port Arthur]] in all but name.  However, after the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in 1900, [[Russian Empire|Russian]] forces used that anti-foreigner insurgency as a pretext to formally invade and occupy most of Manchuria, and Mukden became a Russian stronghold in the [[Far East]] with the building of what would become the [[South Manchurian Railway]] - from [[Harbin]] via Mukden to [[Russian Dalian|Dalny]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_93gAAAAAYAAJ |quote=mukden russians day before formally. |title=The Century illustrated monthly magazine, Volume 68 |year=1904 |publisher=The Century Co. |location=NEW YORK |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_93gAAAAAYAAJ/page/n588 581] |access-date=2011-07-06}}(Original from Harvard University)</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOfUAAAAMAAJ&q=russians+mukden+formally |title=The Century: a popular quarterly, Volume 68 |author=Making of America Project |year=1904 |publisher=Scribner & Co. |location=NEW YORK |page=581 |access-date=2011-07-06 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130527132705/http://books.google.com/books?id=fOfUAAAAMAAJ&q=russians+mukden+formally#v=snippet&q=russians%20mukden%20formally&f=false |archive-date=2013-05-27 |url-status= live}}(Original from the University of Michigan)</ref>

The postmark of the Chinese postal administration kept the spelling "MOUKDEN/{{lang|zh|奉天}}" for usage on international mails until the late 1920s.  After that, a Chinese–Manchurian bilingual type "SHENYANG (MUKDEN)/{{lang|zh-hant|瀋陽}} ({{lang|zh|奉天}})" datestamp was used until 1933.

In the early 20th century, Shenyang began expanding out of its old city walls. The [[Shenyang Railway Station]] on the [[South Manchurian Railway]] and the [[Shenyang North Railway Station]] on the [[Beijing–Harbin Railway|Jingfeng Railway]], both west of the old city, became the new commercial centers of Shenyang.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://epaper.syd.com.cn/sywb/html/2013-10/29/content_954633.htm |script-title=zh:追溯沈阳行政区划的百年印记 |script-work=zh:《沈阳晚报》 |date=2013-10-29 |access-date=2014-05-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111530/http://epaper.syd.com.cn/sywb/html/2013-10/29/content_954633.htm |archive-date=2013-12-24}}</ref>  In the 1920s, Mukden was the capital of the warlord [[Zhang Zuolin]], who was later assassinated when [[Huanggutun Incident|his train was blown up on 4 June 1928]]<ref>Hata 288</ref> at a Japanese-guarded railway bridge.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/mil/2005-05/27/content_3010148.htm |script-title=zh:日本早期对华侵略：皇姑屯事件 |work=[[Xinhua]] |access-date=2014-05-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230181600/http://news.xinhuanet.com/mil/2005-05/27/content_3010148.htm |archive-date=2013-12-30 |url-status=dead}}</ref>  At the time, several factories were built by Zhang to manufacture [[ammunition]] in the northern and eastern suburbs.

Over the past 200 years or so, Shenyang managed to grow and increase its industrial might during consecutive wars with [[Russo-Japanese War|Russia]] and [[First Sino-Japanese War|Japan]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Second World War]], and [[Chinese Communist Revolution|China's Civil War]] (Shenyang became the main battleground between the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] and [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]]).

==Old City==
[[File:Map of Mukden 1912.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Layout of Shenyang's old city walls]]
The old city of Shenyang resided almost entirely within the modern day [[Shenhe District]], and used to have two [[Chinese city wall|city wall]]s.<ref>

Situated roughly within the area bounded by the four "Shuncheng" ({{zh|s=顺城|l=along the city|labels=no}}) roads/streets in Shenhe District, the (now-demolished) square-shaped inner city wall marked the bounds of ancient Shenyang. The earliest wall was built in 926 during early [[Liao dynasty]] to settle [[Northern Song]] civilians the [[Khitan people|Khitans]] abducted from raids to use as [[unfree labour|slave labourer]]s{{cn|date=September 2024}}, and was then made of [[rammed earth]] because the city was merely a small settlement at the time (historically the administrative center of the [[Liaodong]] region was at [[Liaoyang]]).{{cn|date=September 2024}} However, in 1368, [[Hongwu Emperor]] of the newly founded [[Ming dynasty]] ordered a new regional military command—the Liaodong Regional Military Commission ({{zh|t=遼東都指揮使司|labels=no}})—to be established, and Shenyang was made a prominent regional "guard town" ({{zh|t=衛所|labels=no}}). In 1388, Min Zhong ({{zh|t=閔忠|labels=no}}), the newly appointed city commissioner of the Shenyang Central Guard, wrote to Hongwu Emperor immediately upon his tenure requesting permission to upgrade the city wall, and the old wall was made taller and thoroughly reinforced with overlaid bricks.{{cn|date=September 2024}} According to ''[[History of Ming]]'', the reconstructed Ming-era wall was 2.5 ''[[zhàng]]'' ({{convert|8|m|disp=or|abbr=off}}) tall, more than 1 ''zhàng'' ({{convert|3.2|m|disp=or|1|abbr=off}}) wide at the top, and 9 ''[[li (unit)|li]]'' and 30 ''bu'' (about {{convert|5.2|km|disp=or|1|abbr=off}}) long.  It has two layers of [[moat]]s dug outside, each being 3 ''zhàng'' ({{convert|9.6|m|disp=or|1|abbr=off}}) wide and 8 ''[[chi (unit)|chi]]'' ({{convert|2.56|m|disp=or|1|abbr=off}}) deep, fed with water from the Little Shen River (the present day South Canal). There were four [[city gate]]s, each at the center of one side, connected by two main roads that intersected at Central Temple of the city's center in a "+" fashion.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

This Ming wall was heavily damaged in 1625 when the Manchus laid siege and captured the city, with only the north wall and [[gate tower]] (which had undergone reinforcing reconstructions in 1545 under the orders of [[Jiajing Emperor]]) remained intact.{{cn|date=September 2024}} The Manchu leader [[Nurhachi]] however saw the city's strategic value and decided to formally relocate his [[Qing dynasty|Later Jin]] capital from Liaoyang to Shenyang, and ordered the wall to be rebuilt.{{cn|date=September 2024}} According to ''Annals of Mukden'' ({{zh|t=盛京通志|labels=no}}), the new city wall was a standard [[brick#Fired brick|black brick]] [[defensive wall|wall]] standing at a height of 3.5 ''zhàng'' (about {{convert|12.5|m|disp=or|1|abbr=off}}), a width of 1.8 ''zhàng'' (about {{convert|6.4|m|disp=or|1|abbr=off}}) and a total length of 9 ''li'' and 332 ''bu'' (about {{convert|6.4|km|disp=or|1|abbr=off}}), complete with 12 [[fortified tower|tower]]s (8 gates and 4 corners) and a widened 14.5-''zhàng'' (about {{convert|52|m|disp=or|adj=mid|abbr=off}}) moat. The city gates were increased from four to eight, though the old Ming-era north gate tower was preserved but sealed shut, later known as the "Ninth Gate" ({{zh|t=九門|labels=no}}).{{cn|date=September 2024}}

The outer city wall, called the "peripheral wall" ({{zh|t=邊牆|p=Biān Qiáng|labels=no}}) or "[[fortification|pass]] wall" ({{zh|t=關牆|p=Guān Qiáng|labels=no}}), was actually a [[rammed earth]] [[rampart (fortification)|rampart]] built in 1680 to expand the urban area outside the inner city.{{cn|date=September 2024}} It was almost round in shape, standing at a height of 7.5 ''chi'' (around {{convert|2.7|m|disp=or|1|abbr=off}}) and an overall length of 32 ''li'' and 24 ''bu'' (about {{convert|20.7|km|disp=or|1|abbr=off}}), and also had eight towerless gates known as the "peripheral gates" ({{zh|t=邊門|p=Biān Mén|labels=no}}). The corresponding inner and outer gates were linked by roads that intersected within the inner city in a "#" pattern around the [[Mukden Palace]].{{cn|date=September 2024}}

Nearly all of these city walls and gates were demolished after 1949.{{cn|date=September 2024}} Two gates and one corner tower of the inner wall were rebuilt during the 1990s.{{cn|date=September 2024}} There had, however, been proposals to rebuild the other gates and towers in preparation to the [[2013 National Games of China|12th National Games in 2013]].

Around {{convert|2.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} outside Shenyang's former outer wall, there were four [[pagoda]]s each located within an associated [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] temple, namely the East Pagoda in Yongguang Temple ({{zh|t=永光寺|labels=no}}), the South Pagoda in Guangci Temple ({{zh|t=廣慈寺|labels=no}}), the West Pagoda in Yanshou Temple ({{zh|t=延壽寺|labels=no}}) and the North Pagoda in Falun Temple ({{zh|t=法輪寺|labels=no}}). They were built in 1643 and completed in 1645.{{cn|date=September 2024}} The four pagodas are identical white Buddha-[[stupa]]s as tall as {{convert|26|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Nowadays only the temple for the North Pagoda is well preserved, the East and South has only the pagodas left, and the temple for the West Pagoda was rebuilt in 1998.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

Both the [[Temple of Heaven]] and Temple of Earth were also to be found in the old city during the [[Qing dynasty]].{{cn|date=September 2024}} They were smaller replicas of Beijing's counterparts. Neither exists today.

Shenyang ranges in latitude from 41° 11' to 43° 02' N and in longitude from 122° 25' to 123° 48' E, and is located in the central part of Liaoning province.  The western parts of the city's administrative area are located on the [[alluvial plain]] of the [[Liao River]] system, while the eastern part consists of the hinterlands of the [[Changbai Mountains]], and is covered with forests.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.syghgt.gov.cn/ywpd/kczy/content/4028e48233b28ecb01343f9e7c6822ad.html |script-title=zh:沈阳区域地质概述 |publisher=Shenyang Planning and Land and Resources Bureau ({{lang|zh-hans|沈阳市规划和国土资源局}}) |access-date=2014-02-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219065711/http://www.syghgt.gov.cn/ywpd/kczy/content/4028e48233b28ecb01343f9e7c6822ad.html |archive-date=2014-02-19 |url-status=live }}</ref>  The highest point in Shenyang is {{convert|414|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[metres above sea level|above sea level]] and the lowest point only {{convert|7|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://minsheng.youth.cn/mszxgch/mswzxx/201308/t20130814_3698864.htm |script-title=zh:沈城母亲河:水光异彩 璀璨浑河 |script-work=zh:中国青年网 |access-date=2013-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106050430/http://minsheng.youth.cn/mszxgch/mswzxx/201308/t20130814_3698864.htm |archive-date=2013-11-06 |url-status=live}}</ref>  The average elevation of the urban area is {{convert|45|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="jdsycsfzyshbq">{{Cite thesis |degree=博士 |script-title=zh:近代沈阳城市发展与社会变迁 |author=孙鸿金 |year=2012}}</ref>

The city's main urban area is located to the north of '''[[Hun River (Liao River tributary)|Hun River]]''', formerly the largest tributary of the Liao River ''proper'' and often locally referred as the city's "mother river".  The central urban area is surrounded by three [[canal|artificial river]]s — respectively the '''South Canal''' ({{lang|zh-hans|南运河}}) from the south and southeast, the '''Xinkai River''' ({{lang|zh-hans|新开河}}, formerly the '''North Canal''') from the north and northeast, and the '''Weigong River''' ({{lang|zh-hans|卫工河}}, formerly the Weigong [[Nullah]]) from the west, all interconnected by channels as a continuous [[waterway]].  The South Canal in particular, famous for the series of [[linear park]]s and gardens along it, was [[canalized]] from the old course of the '''Wanquan River''' ({{zh|t=萬泉河|l=ten thousand springs river|labels=no}}), historically also called the '''Little Shen River''' ({{zh|t=小瀋水|labels=no}}) or '''Wuli River''' ({{zh|t=五里河|l=five-''[[li (unit)|li]]'' river|labels=no}}), which was a principal water source for the old city.<ref name="southcanal">{{cite web |url=http://www.shenhe.gov.cn/dev~shenheweb/home/article/A5978D2B-1760-438A-A4BB-FA0EABAA710D.html |script-title=zh:南运河的今与昔 |publisher=Shenhe District People's Government |access-date=2016-10-31 |language=zh |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101101759/http://www.shenhe.gov.cn/dev~shenheweb/home/article/A5978D2B-1760-438A-A4BB-FA0EABAA710D.html |archive-date=2016-11-01 |url-status=live}}</ref>   These are reinforced on the peripheries by smaller rivers such as Xi River ({{lang|zh-hans|细河}}), Puhe River ({{lang|zh-hans|蒲河}}) and Mantang River ({{lang|zh-hans|满堂河}}), and drains into the Hun River at three different locations on the southeast, due south and southwest side of the city.  There was also previously another canal on the east side called Huishan Nullah ({{lang|zh-hans|辉山明渠}}) that drains into Xinkai River's lower section, but is now no longer existent due to [[land reclamation]] from urban constructions.

===Environment===
Shenyang has many [[park]]s, among the most famous are the {{cvt|14.5|km}} '''South Canal Linear Parks''' ({{zh|s=南运河带状公园|labels=no}}) situated along the homonymous river traversing the southern parts of Dadong, Shenhe and Heping Districts. It comprises 6 large [[park]]s and 18 [[linear park|riverside garden]]s covering an area of approximately {{cvt|1400000|m2|acre}}, with exotic variety of vegetations such as [[Chinese rose|rose]], [[Siberian apricot|apricot]], [[bladder cherry]], [[Chinese honeylocust|honeylocust]], [[natal lily]], [[scarlet sage]], [[ivy morning glory|morning glory]] and [[Rudbeckia hirta|black-eyed-Susan]], and extensive [[greenway (landscape)|greenspace]]s of [[peach]], [[Chinese pear|pear]], [[Asiatic apple|crabapple]]s, [[ginkgo]]s, [[weeping willow (tree)|weeping willow]]s, [[pine]]s and [[black locust]]s.<ref name="southcanal"/>  It is the largest stretch of vegetated [[urban open space]] in Shenyang, contributing significantly to the city's 40-percent "[[greening]] ratio", and was instrumental in the city being awarded the "national forest city" title in 2005.

According to the Shenyang Environmental Protection Bureau, winter usage of coal by [[heat-only boiler station|boiler station]]s for [[hydronic]] [[district heating]] is the source of 30 percent of the air pollution in Shenyang.  Half of the 16 million metric tons of coal consumed by the city during the winter of 2013&ndash;2014 were used for heating.  Other major factors include dust from construction sites (20 percent), vehicle exhaust (20 percent), industrial emissions (10 percent) and extraterritorial dust (20 percent, mostly [[yellow dust]] from [[Gobi Desert]]).  However, air quality was described by the Bureau as "slowly improving".<ref name=CE111313>{{cite news |author1=Liu Ce |title=Coal for heating identified as top air polluter in NE China |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2013-11/13/content_17103212.htm |access-date=December 10, 2014 |work=China Daily |publisher=chinadaily.com.cn |date=2013-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924033901/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2013-11/13/content_17103212.htm |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Shenyang has a [[monsoon]]-influenced [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dwa'') characterised by hot, humid summers due to the monsoon, and dry, cold winters due to the [[Siberian anticyclone]].  The four seasons here are distinctive.  Nearly half of the annual rainfall occurs in July and August.  Monthly mean temperatures range from {{convert|−11.4|C|F|1}} in January to {{convert|24.9|C|F|1}} in July, for an annual average of {{convert|8.6|C|F|1}}.  The frost-free period is 183 days, which is long considering the severity of the winters.<ref name="Shenyang Introduction">{{cite web |url=http://www.shenyang.gov.cn/web/resource/hlzd-yw/hlzd-yw-01.htm |title=A city full of vitality – Shenyang, China |publisher=People′s Government of Shenyang |access-date=2011-03-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707041552/http://www.shenyang.gov.cn/web/resource/hlzd-yw/hlzd-yw-01.htm |archive-date=July 7, 2011}}</ref>  The city receives 2,421 hours of bright sunshine annually; monthly percent of possible ranges from 42&nbsp;percent in July to 64&nbsp;percent in February.

[[File:Txu-oclc-6654394-nk-51-4th-ed.jpg|thumb|Map of Shenyang (labeled as SHEN-YANG) and surrounding region (1975)]]
Shenyang's metropolitan area traditionally consisted of the 5 small inner urban districts, surrounded by 4 larger outer suburban districts, and accompanied by 4 rural counties on the north and west sides.  In general, [[agriculture]], [[animal husbandry]] and agricultural product processing dominate northeastern Shenyang; eastern Shenyang is an [[automotive parts]] hub; southern Shenyang is a high-tech industrial base; and western Shenyang is home to [[heavy machinery]] manufacturing.  The city center specialises in retail and financial services.<ref name="Critical Eye on Shenyang"/>

Out of the rural counties, the Xinmin County was upgraded to a [[county-level city]] in 1993, and the Liaozhong County was incorporated into a new suburban district in 2016 as part of the [[Northeast Area Revitalization Plan|provincial/national development plan]].

As a result, Shenyang now officially has direct jurisdiction over 10 [[District of China|city districts]], 1 [[satellite city]] and 2 [[County (People's Republic of China)|rural counties]]:

[[File:Liaoning Station before 1949.jpeg|thumb|The old Liaoning General Station]]
The '''Shenyang North Railway Station''' ({{zh|s=沈阳北站|p=Shěnyáng Běi Zhàn}}) was formerly the '''Liaoning General Station''' ({{zh|t=遼寧總站|p=Liáoníng Zǒngzhàn|labels=no}}) before 1946, and colloquially known as the "Old North Station".  The original station building (now an [[Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level|MHCSPNL]]-listed heritage building), initially named the '''Fengtian City Station''' ({{zh|t=奉天城站|p=Fèngtīan Chéng Zhàn|labels=no}}) at the time of completion, was built in 1927 at the terminal point of [[Beijing–Harbin Railway|Jingfeng Railway]], about {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of the current station site, on the orders of warlord [[Zhang Zuolin]] to compete with the then Japanese-administered Shenyang Railway Station.  The Main Station Building ({{zh|c=主站房|labels=no}}) of the current "New North Station" began construction in 1986 and was commissioned for operation in December 1990, and became one of the five most important railway hubs in China, earning itself the nickname "'''Northeast's No. 1 Station'''" ({{zh|s=东北第一站|labels=no}}).<ref name="hscb">{{cite news |author=李淑娟 |script-title=zh:沈阳北站被称为"东北第一站" |url=http://news.liao1.com/epaper/hscb/html/2009-09/26/content_129031.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212043350/http://news.liao1.com/epaper/hscb/html/2009-09/26/content_129031.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-12-12 |script-work=zh:《华商晨报》 |location=Shenyang, Liaoning |date=2009-09-26 |access-date=2013-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |script-title=zh:沈阳北站："京哈铁路"动脉上的心脏 |url=http://news.liao1.com/newspage/2009/08/4319472.html |script-work=zh:《沈阳日报》 |date=2009-08-23 |access-date=2013-11-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203112158/http://news.liao1.com/newspage/2009/08/4319472.html |archive-date=2013-12-03}}</ref>  In 2011, a huge expansion project known as the "North Station Transport Hub Reconstruction Project" ({{zh|s=北站交通枢纽改造工程|labels=no}}) was initiated in response to the growing demand of floor area posed by the increasing passenger traffic after introduction of the [[High-speed rail in China|high-speed rail]] service.  The station now has an additional 3-storey "Sub-Station Building" ({{zh|s=子站房|labels=no}}) and a "North Square" ({{zh|s=北广场|labels=no}}) on the northern (Huanggu District) side of the railways, while the old waiting lounge in the original 16-storey Main Station Building is now relocated to a large elevated concourse that bridges over the rail tracks, with a pillar-less roof (the largest in mainland China) doming the platforms.  The original South Square ({{zh|s=南广场|labels=no}}) outside the Main Station Building was rebuilt into a multi-levelled complex, with two above ground forming an elevated airport-style drop-off zone and a large ground-level area for bus stops, as well as a three-level underground city providing shopping malls, parking lots, taxi pick-up and interchange with [[Line 2, Shenyang Metro|Subway Line 2]], while also capable of rapid conversion into an [[air raid shelter]] if needed.

[[File:Shenyang Railway Station.jpg|thumb|Shenyang Railway Station]]
The '''Shenyang Railway Station''' ({{zh|s=沈阳站|p=Shěnyáng Zhàn}}) has a history of more than 100 years.  It was built by the Russians in 1899 on the eastern side of the [[South Manchurian Railway]] and was named the '''Fengtian Station''' ({{zh|t=奉天站|p=Fèngtiān Zhàn}}) at the time.  It was later expanded by the Japanese after the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and renamed to '''Fengtian [[Yam (route)|Yam]]''' ({{zh|t=奉天驛|p=Fèngtiān Yì}}) until the end of the [[World War II]].  Before adopting its current name, the station was known as the '''Shenyang South Railway Station''' ({{zh|t=瀋陽南站|p=Shěnyáng Nán Zhàn}}) or simply the "South Station" (in contrast to the forementioned "North Station") between 1945 and 1950, a name the locals still use colloquially to present days (though the current [[Shenyang South railway station]] is actually at the suburban junction between [[Hunnan]] and [[Sujiatun]]).  Today, the station focuses on regular-speed passenger service and is being refurbished with a large archway and new terminal, reducing access to the boarding platforms by rerouting customers under and over ground while construction is completed.  The station was expanded in 2010 with the addition of a new West Station Building ({{zh|s=西站房|labels=no}}) and a West Square ({{zh|s=西广场|labels=no}}) on the western side of the railways.<ref name="沈阳站西">{{cite news |author=李莉 |script-title=zh:沈阳站西出口明年底建成 西广场建设规划已敲定 |url=http://liaoning.nen.com.cn/liaoning/223/3678223.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212193719/http://liaoning.nen.com.cn/liaoning/223/3678223.shtml |archive-date=2013-12-12 |script-work=zh:《沈阳日报》 |publisher=沈阳日报传媒集团 |date=2010-12-21 |access-date=2013-08-02}}</ref>  The old East Station Building ({{zh|s=东站房|labels=no}}) is currently on the provincial protected heritage list.

===Road===
[[File:ShenyangDistrictAndLandmark.jpg|thumb|Shenyang's districts, landmarks and major roads]]
In the [[Manchukuo]] era, the initial road transportation network was laid out, as is now in the central districts of Shenyang.{{cn|date=September 2024}} The city follows a largely [[grid plan|grid]]-style urban layout, with the roads follow a slightly tilted northwest-to-southeast orientation due to the [[South Manchurian Railway]], which runs perpendicular to that direction. The streets in Shenyang are almost always named according to a routine convention — one that runs more in the north–south direction is called a "street" ({{zh|s=街|p=Jīe|labels=no}}) or "avenue" ({{zh|s=大街|p=Dà Jīe|l=big street|labels=no}}), and one that runs more east–west are call a "road" ({{zh|s=路|p=Lù|labels=no}}) or "boulevard" ({{zh|s=大道|p=Dà Dào|l=big path|labels=no}}).  The only exceptions to this rule are the east–west Middle Street in [[Shenhe District]], which takes its historical name from ancient times (though its modern official name is actually the "[[Zhongjie|Middle Street Road]]"); and the north–south Minzhu Road ({{zh|s=民主路|labels=no}}) in [[Heping District, Shenyang|Heping District]] that traverses diagonally across the [[City block#Superblock|superblock]] between the [[Shenyang Railway Station]] and the Zhongshan Park, but as one of the only three diagonal streets in the entire city it is accommodated as a "road" instead of "street" in keeping with the other two diagonal counterparts that run east–west.

In addition to the grid streets, Shenyang also was developing several [[ring road]] systems, going back as early as the "Fengtian City Plan" ({{zh|t=奉天都邑計劃|labels=no}}) proposed by the Japanese-controlled [[puppet state|puppet]] [[Manchukuo]] government in 1932.{{cn|date=September 2024}} Outside of the (now demolished) city walls, the city initially planned three [[beltway]]s, namely the "inner ring", "middle ring" and "outer ring" roads.  Gradually with urban development, the inner ring idea faded away into the inner city grids, but the middle ring concept was retained and later transformed into the nowadays '''1st Ring Road''' ({{zh|s=一环路|labels=no}}, officially called the "Middle Ring Road" until 1995), and the outer ring morphed roughly into parts of the present day '''2nd Ring Road''' ({{zh|s=二环路|labels=no}}).  The '''3rd Ring Road''' ({{zh|s=三环路|labels=no}}) was completed in 1995, and in 2013 was upgraded into an 8-lane, {{convert|82|km|mi|abbr=on}} freeway—the G15<sub>01</sub> [[G1501 Shenyang Ring Expressway|Shenyang Ring Expressway]] ({{lang|zh-Hans|沈阳绕城高速公路}}). The 10-lane, {{convert|132|km|mi|abbr=on}} '''4th Ring Road''' ({{zh|s=四环路|labels=no}}) is a [[limited-access highway]] about {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} out from the 3rd Ring, completed in 2013.  The planned 6-lane, {{convert|198|km|mi|abbr=on}} '''5th Ring Road''' ({{zh|s=五环路|labels=no}}) and the proposed {{convert|399|km|mi|abbr=on}} '''6th Ring Road''' ({{zh|s=六环路|labels=no}}), also known as the [[G91 Liaozhong Ring Expressway]] ({{zh|s=辽中环线高速公路|labels=no}}), are both currently under construction.

[[File:Jingshen Expwy Jul2004.jpg|thumb|G1 Beijing-Harbin Expressway, Shenyang segment]]
Shenyang is connected to the other regions by several major expressways in radial pattern. The [[Shenyang–Dalian Expressway|G15 Shenda Expressway]] ({{zh|s=沈大高速公路|labels=no}}) to the southwest is the first expressway built in China and is an 8-lane, {{convert|348.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[controlled-access highway]] with a maximum speed limit of {{convert|120|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, connecting Shenyang to [[Dalian]], one of the largest port city in China. The {{convert|222|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Shendan Expressway]] ({{zh|s=沈丹高速公路|labels=no}}) to the southeast, part of the [[G1113 Dandong–Fuxin Expressway|G11<sub>13</sub> Dandong–Fuxin Expressway]] that traverses Shenyang from the northwest, is a 4-lane expressway leading to [[Benxi]] and [[Dandong]], and also serves [[Shenyang Taoxian International Airport]].  The 4-lane [[G1212 Shenyang–Jilin Expressway|G12<sub>12</sub> Shenji Expressway]] ({{zh|s=沈吉高速公路|labels=no}}) to the east was completed in 2011, linking Shenyang to [[Jilin City|Jilin]] via [[Fushun]]. The 8-lane [[Beijing–Shenyang Expressway|Jingshen Expressway]] ({{zh|s=京沈高速公路|labels=no}}) to the west is an integral part of the extended [[G1 Jingha Expressway]] ({{zh|s=京哈高速公路|labels=no}}) beyond the northeast, and is a major interprovincial "trunk road" across the [[Shanhai Pass]] linking to the national capital [[Beijing]] some {{convert|658|km|mi|abbr=on}} away. There are other smaller provincial-level expressways ("S routes") to other cities like [[Fushun]], [[Liaoyang]] and [[Panjin]], as well as many long-distance and express bus routes to Beijing and other large Northeastern regional centers via major national roads such as the [[China National Highways]] [[China National Highway 101|101]], [[China National Highway 102|102]], [[China National Highway 203|203]] and [[China National Highway 304|304]].
