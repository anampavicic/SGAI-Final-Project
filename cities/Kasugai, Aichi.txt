The area which is now Kasugai contains many [[Kofun period]] [[kofun|burial mounds]]. During the [[Edo period]], the area was mostly part of the holdings of [[Owari Domain]].

With the [[Meiji period]] establishment of the modern municipalities system, the area was organized into villages under [[Higashikasugai District, Aichi|Higashikasugai District]], including the village of Kachigawa on October 1, 1889. Kachigawa was raised to town status on July 25, 1900. On June 1, 1943, Kachigawa was merged with neighboring villages of Toriimatsu and Shinogi to form the city of Kasugai, and in 1958, Kasugai annexed the neighboring towns of Sakashita and Kōzōji. 

Kasugai gained [[Special cities of Japan|special city]] status on April 1, 2001, with increased local autonomy.
