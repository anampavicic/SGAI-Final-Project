==History==
{{more citations needed|date=October 2022|section}}

===Early history of the region===
The early residents of both sides of the Amur in the region of today's Blagoveshchensk were the [[Daur people|Daurs]] and [[Ducher]]s. An early settlement in the area of today's Blagoveshchensk was the Ducher town whose name was reported by the Russian explorer [[Yerofey Khabarov]] as Aytyun in 1652, as Aigun from 1683 to 1685, and as Aigun Old Town from 1685 until [[1900 Amur anti-Chinese pogroms|the massacre in 1900]],<ref>{{citation |chapter=How the Sino-Russian Boundary Conflict Was Finally Settled: From Nerchinsk 1689 to Vladivostok 2005 via Zhenbao Island 1969 |chapter-url = http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/coe21/publish/no16_2_ses/02_maxwell.pdf |last = Maxwell |first = Neville |page = 56 |date=June 2007 |editor-last = Iwashita |editor-first=Akihiro |title = Eager Eyes Fixed on Eurasia |series = 21st Century COE Program Slavic Eurasian Studies |publisher = Slavic Research Center, Hokkaido University |location = Sapporo |access-date = 24 February 2009}}</ref> which known to Russian archaeologists as the Grodekovo site, after the nearby village of [[Grodekovo, Amur Oblast|Grodekovo]] some {{convert|25|-|30|km|abbr=on|lk=out}} southeast of Blagoveshchensk.

There is nothing much near the site of Blagoveshchensk itself (at the confluence of the ''Saghalien'' (Amur) River and the ''Tchikiri'' (Zeya) River)]]

As the Russians tried to assert their control over the region, the Ducher town was probably vacated when the Duchers were evacuated by the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] to the [[Sungari]] or [[Mudanjiang River|Hurka]] in the mid-1650s.<ref name="amu" /> Since 1673, the Chinese re-used the site for their fort ("Old Aigun", in modern literature),<ref name="tim1">Олег Анатольевич Тимофеев (Oleg Anatolyevich Timofeyev). [http://www.igpi.ru/center/lib/hist_tradit/east/china/timofeev1.html "Российско-китайские отношения в Приамурье (сер. XIX – нач. XX вв.)"] (''Russian-Chinese relations in the Amur region, mid-19th - early 20th centuries''). Part 1. Blagoveshchensk, 2003.</ref> which served in 1683-1685 as a base for the Manchus' campaign against the Russian fort of [[Albazin]] further north.<ref>Bruce Mancall, ''Russia and China:Their Diplomatic Relations to 1728'' (1971), pp. 115-127.</ref>

After the capture of Albazin in 1685 or 1686, the Chinese relocated their town, to a new site on the right (southwestern, i.e. presently Chinese) bank of the Amur, about {{convert|3|mi}} downstream from the original site; it later became known as [[Aigun]].<ref name="rav48">[[Ernst Georg Ravenstein|E. G. Ravenstein]], ''[https://archive.org/details/russiansonamuri00ravegoog The Russians on the Amur]''. London (1861), pg. 48.</ref><ref>Note that the distance between modern Grodekovo and the historic Aigun on the Chinese side of the river is about {{convert|15|km|sp=us}} on modern maps, rather than {{convert|3|mi}}, as Ravenstein states. However, the location of the Grodekovo archaeological site (i.e., the "Old Aigun") may be quite a distance from the eponymous village; and Ravenstein may be somewhat imprecise in the number.</ref>

The [[Russian–China border conflicts|series of conflicts between Russians and China]] ended with  Russia's recognition of the Chinese sovereignty over both sides of the Amur by the [[Nerchinsk Treaty]] of 1689.

===Russian settlement===
As the balance of power in the region had changed by the mid-19th century, the [[Russian Empire]] was able [[Amur Annexation|to take over]] the left (generally northern, but around Blagoveshchensk, eastern) bank of the Amur from China. Since the 1858 [[Aigun Treaty]] and the 1860 [[Treaty of Peking]], the river has remained the border between the countries, although the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] subjects were allowed to continue to live in the so-called [[Sixty-Four Villages East of the River|Sixty-Four Villages]] east of the Amur and the Zeya (i.e., within today's Blagoveshchensk's eastern suburbs).
[[File:Blagoveshchensk-Csesarevich-Nicholas-Triumphal-Arch.jpg|thumb|The triumphal arch erected in Blagoveshchensk to welcome [[Nicholas II of Russia|Crown Prince Nicholas]] in 1891]]

Although Russian settlers had lived in the area as early as 1644 and was known as {{lang|zh-Latn|Hailanpao}} ({{zh|c=[[:zh:海兰泡|海兰泡]]|p=Hǎilánpāo|s=海兰泡|t=海蘭泡}}), the present-day city began in 1856<ref name="gr">{{cite book|title=Энциклопедия Города России|year=2003|publisher=Большая Российская Энциклопедия|location=Moscow|isbn=5-7107-7399-9|pages=47–48}}</ref> as the military outpost of ''Ust-Zeysky''; this name means ''settlement at the mouth of the [[Zeya River]]'' in Russian. [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;II]] gave approval for the founding of the city in 1858 as the seat of government for the Amur region, to be named Blagoveshchensk (literally "the city of good news") after the parish church which was dedicated to the [[Annunciation]]. According to Blagoveshchensk authorities, by 1877 the city had some 8,000 residents, with merely 15 foreigners (presumably, Chinese) among them.<ref name="tim1" />

The city was an important river port and trade center during the late 19th century, with growth further fueled by a [[gold]] rush early in the 20th century and by its position on the Chinese border opposite the city of [[Heihe]].

Local historians noted the pre-eminence of Blagoveshchensk in the economy of the late 19th century [[Russian Far East]], which was reflected when the heir to the Russian throne, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas Alexandrovich]] (the future Tsar Nicholas&nbsp;II), visited in 1891 during his [[Eastern journey of Nicholas II|grand tour of Asiatic Russia]], and the locals presented him with [[bread and salt]] on a gold tray, rather than on a silver one as in other cities of the region.<ref>Валентина Кобзарь (Valentina Kobzar).

===The Boxer Rebellion===
In the course of the [[Boxer Rebellion]], the Qing Imperial army (made out of Manchus and Han Chinese) and Boxer insurgents [[Battles on Amur River (1900)|shelled the city]] in July 1900. Chinese [[Honghuzi]] forces joined the attack against Blagoveshchensk.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Central European University Press|editor=Pál Nyíri, Joana Breidenbach|year=2005|isbn=963-7326-14-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=icZJJN0wYPcC&q=khunkhuzy+russians&pg=PA90|access-date=18 March 2012|author=Joana Breidenbach|title=China inside out: contemporary Chinese nationalism and transnationalism|edition=illustrated|quote=The political component of Chinese banditism emerged only in the year 1900. For the first time, Khunkhuzy attacked the Russian city of Blagoveshchensk. It ended in the drowning of about 3,000 Chinese near Blagoveshchensk (called Hailanbao in Chinese). When during the Boxer Uprising Boxers and khunkhuzy assaulted Russian positions nearby, Cossacks stationed there decided to drive the Chinese from the Russian bank of the river back onto the Chinese bank. People were simply pushed into the river, and many of them drowned. Even Vladimir Lenin personally criticized the Russian tsarist government for its brutality.|page=90}}</ref> According to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] belief, the city was allegedly saved by a miraculous [[icon]] of Our Lady of Albazin, which was prayed to continuously during the shelling which lasted almost two weeks.

On 3 July ([[Old Style]]), a decision was made by the city's Police Chief Batarevich and the Military Governor Gribsky to deport the city's entire community of Qing subjects including ethnic [[Manchus]], [[Daur people]] and Han, numbering 4,008<ref name="tim1" />), who were viewed as potential [[Fifth Column|fifth columnists]]. As cross-river shipping was interrupted by the rebellion, the question arose how to get them from the Russian to the Chinese side of the Amur. Batarevich suggested that the deportees could be first taken east of the [[Zeya River|Zeya]], where they should obtain boats from the local Chinese villagers. The plan, however, was vetoed by the governor, and the decision was made instead to take the deportees to the ''[[stanitsa]]'' of Verkhneblagoveshchenskaya—the place where the Amur is at its narrowest—and make them leave Russia there. As the local ''[[ataman]]'' refused to provide boats to take them across the river (despite the orders of his superior), few of them made it to the Chinese side. The rest drowned in the Amur, or were shot or axed by the police, Cossacks and local volunteers, when refusing to leave the bank. Local Chinese memory holds that a massacre that took place then, at the hand of Cossacks, which killed so many that the Amur River was choked.<ref>[[Colin Thubron]], ''The Amur River: Between Russia and China,'' [[Random House]], 2021  {{isbn| 978-1-473-56591-3}} pp. 131-133.</ref> According to Chinese sources, about 5,000&nbsp;people reportedly died during these events of 4–8 July 1900.<ref>Олег Анатольевич Тимофеев (Oleg Anatolyevich Timofeyev). [http://www.igpi.ru/center/lib/hist_tradit/east/china/Timofeyev2.html "Российско-китайские отношения в Приамурье (сер. XIX – нач. XX вв.)"] (''Russian-Chinese relations in the Amur region, mid-19th - early 20th centuries''). Part 2. Blagoveshchensk, 2003. Quote: "3 июля благовещенский полицмейстер Батаревич предложил военному губернатору Амурской области К.Н. Грибскому депортировать китайцев на правый берег... Сразу же возник вопрос о транспортных средствах для перевозки нескольких тысяч человек...

Батаревич в конечном итоге принял решение о переправе всех китайцев в районе ст. Верхнеблаговещенской – месте, где Амур наиболее узок...

По прибытии в ст. Верхнеблаговещенскую события приняли еще более драматический оборот. Местный атаман Писарев, несмотря на приказ председателя амурского войскового правления полковника Волковинского, наотрез отказался предоставить китайцам имевшиеся у него шаланду и лодки, опасаясь их захвата противником. Китайцам было предложено переправляться самим, хотя среди них имелись старики и дети. К этому времени к берегу подошли озлобленные продолжающимся обстрелом местные жители. Совершенно естественное нежелание депортируемых самим идти на смерть окружившими их русскими было воспринято почти как вооруженное восстание. Во время последующего следствия Шабанов и Писарев пытались обвинить друг друга в попустительстве началу расправы. Начальник конвоя указывал в рапорте, что стрелял один из местных казаков, неизвестно по чьему приказу. При опросе атамана и казаков станицы ими было заявлено, что переправа (то есть истребление – О.Т.) началась лишь после того, как помощник пристава «принял более строгие меры».

На деле эти меры свелись к уничтожению безоружных китайцев как на берегу, так и уже в воде. Как гласят цинские источники, депортируемых связывали косами по пять-шесть человек и штыками загоняли в воду. Отказавшихся переправляться Шабанов приказал, по свидетельству очевидцев, зарубить топорами. По некоторым данным, огонь был открыт и с цинской стороны. Из всей партии до противоположного берега доплыли лишь 80-100 человек".</ref>

There were 1,266 households in the city, including 900 Daurs and 4,500 Manchus until the massacre.<ref>俄罗斯帝国总参谋部. 《亚洲地理、地形和统计材料汇编》. 俄罗斯帝国: 圣彼得堡. 1886年: 第三十一卷·第185页 （俄语）.</ref> Many Manchu villages were burned by Cossacks in the massacre according to Victor Zatsepine.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Higgins |first1=Andrew |title=On Russia-China Border, Selective Memory of Massacre Works for Both Sides |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/world/europe/russia-china-border.html |agency=The New York Times |date=26 March 2020}}</ref>

This expulsion of the local Chinese caused some hardships for Blagoveshchensk consumers. For example, during the second half of 1900 it became almost impossible to buy any green vegetables in the town, and ten eggs would cost 30-50 [[kopeck]]s (and in winter, as much as a rouble), while before it had been possible to buy ten eggs for 10-15 kopecks.<ref name="tim1" />

The massacre angered the Chinese, and had ramifications for the future: the Chinese [[Honghuzi]] fought a guerilla war against Russian occupation and assisted the Japanese in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] against the Russians in revenge. [[Louis Livingston Seaman]] mentioned the massacre as being the reason for the Chinese [[Honghuzi]] hatred towards the Russians:<blockquote>The Chinaman, be he Hung-hutze or peasant, in his relation to the Russians in this conflict with Japan has not forgotten the terrible treatment accorded him since the Muscovite occupation of Manchuria. He still remembers the massacre at Blagovestchensk when nearly 8,000 unarmed men, women, and children were driven at the point of the bayonet into the raging Amur, until — as one of the Russian officers who participated in that brutal murder told me at Chin-Wang-Tao in 1900 — "the execution of my orders made me almost sick, for it seemed as though I could have walked across the river on the bodies of the floating dead." Not a Chinaman escaped, except forty who were employed by a leading foreign merchant who ransomed their lives at a thousand roubles each. These, and many even worse, atrocities are remembered and now is their moment for revenge. So it was easy for Japan to enlist the sympathy of these men, especially when emphasized by liberal pay, as is now the case. It is believed that more than 10,000 of these bandits, divided into companies of from 200 to 300 each and led by Japanese officers, are now in the pay of Japan.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=S.

The city was also the site of conflict during the [[Russian Civil War]], with Japanese troops occupying the city in support of the [[White Army]]. From 1920 until 1922, the city was declared part of the [[Far Eastern Republic]], an area which was nominally independent, but in reality a buffer zone under control of the [[Russian SFSR]]. The city became the administrative center of [[Amur Oblast]] in 1932.

==Geography==
The city is located at the confluence of the Amur and the Zeya Rivers, opposite to the Chinese city of Heihe.

===Climate===
Blagoveschensk experiences a monsoon-influenced [[hot-summer humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dwa''), bordering on a monsoon-influenced [[warm-summer humid continental climate]] (''Dwb'') which it had before 1990. The climate is very strongly continental. The city features frigid, windy, but dry winters due to the influence of the [[Siberian high]], and warm, wet summers, due to the [[East Asian monsoon]]. On 1 August 2011, it became the first city in the [[Russian Far East]] to be hit by a tornado.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}

==Economy==
Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the city's economic focus has turned to border trade with China. The town is now home to a large Chinese expatriate community. Blagoveshchensk is part of a free trade zone which includes the Chinese city of Heihe, located on the other side of the Amur River.<ref name="rbth">{{cite news|url=http://rbth.ru/articles/2011/05/16/blagoveshchensk_russias_anchor_on_the_amur_river_12889.html|title=Blagoveshchensk: Russia's anchor on the Amur River|publisher=Russia Beyond the Headlines|date=16 May 2011}}</ref>

Main industries in the town include [[metal]] and [[timber]] processing, as well as [[paper]] production.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}

===Transportation===
[[File:Пограничный мост Благовещенск-Хэйхэ.png|thumb|[[Blagoveshchensk–Heihe Bridge]]]]

The city is served by a branch highway and railway connecting it to [[Belogorsk, Amur Oblast|Belogorsk]] on the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] and [[Trans-Siberian Highway]]. It is also served by a river port. On the other side of the [[Amur River]] is [[Heihe]], [[Heilongjiang Province]], China, which is the starting point of [[China National Highway 202]] that goes south to [[Harbin]] and [[Dalian]]. [[Ignatyevo Airport]], located {{convert|20|km|sp=us}} northwest of the city center, serves domestic destinations.

The [[Blagoveshchensk–Heihe Bridge]], completed at the end of 2019, includes a 2-lane highway bridge over the Amur to link Blagoveshchensk and Heihe.

The world's first international [[Aerial lift|cable car]] to Heihe has also been proposed to open in 2022.<ref>{{cite web |author=Amy Woodyatt |title=The world's first cross-border cable car will travel from Russia to China in under 8 minutes |url=https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/russia-china-cable-car-scli/index.html |website=CNN |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Russia to China in under eight minutes: World's first cross-border cable car unveiled |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-31/world-first-cable-car-to-connect-russia-and-china/11371308 |work=abc.net.au |date=31 July 2019 |language=en-AU}}</ref>
