'''Clinton Township''' is a [[charter township]] in [[Macomb County, Michigan|Macomb County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]]. A northern suburb of [[Metro Detroit|Detroit]], Clinton Township is located about {{convert|22|mi|km}} northeast of [[downtown Detroit]]. As of the [[2020 United States Census|2020 census]], the township had a population of 100,513, making it the [[List of municipalities in Michigan|most populous township]] in Michigan, and the state's 8th-most populous community overall.

==History==
The first settlement on the land that is now Clinton Township was called [[Gnadenhutten, Michigan|Gnadenhuetten]] and was established in 1782 by Rev. [[David Zeisberger]], but closed in 1786. It was organized as "Huron Township" on August 12, 1818, named after what was then known as the Huron River. Because of confusion with another [[Huron River]] south of Detroit, on July 17, 1824, the Michigan Territorial Legislature renamed both the township and the river after [[DeWitt Clinton]], the popular governor of [[New York (state)|New York]] from 1817 to 1823 who was largely responsible for building the [[Erie Canal]] which enabled many settlers to come to Michigan.<ref name="Leeson">{{cite book | last = Leeson | first = Michael A. | title = History of Macomb County | orig-year = 1882 | url = http://name.umdl.umich.edu/arh7613.0001.001 | access-date = 2006-10-01 | year = 2005 | publisher = University of Michigan Library | location = Ann Arbor, Mich. | page = 297 | chapter = Organization| chapter-url = http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=micounty;cc=micounty;idno=arh7613.0001.001;q1=shelby;frm=frameset;view=image;seq=299;page=root;size=s
