== History ==

=== Early ===
The origins of Chiniot are obscure, and historical records accurately detailing its founding are unavailable.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BLVKxMblysoC&q=chiniot+history&pg=RA2-PA59-IA2|title=Report on the Revised Settlement of the Jhang District of the Punjab, 1874-1880|last=Steedman|first=E. B.|date=1882|publisher=W. Ball|language=en}}</ref> According to some accounts, the city was founded by an ancient king's daughter named Chandan, who while on a hunting expedition, was charmed by the surrounding area, and ordered the construction of the settlement of ''Chandaniot,''<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z6NLAQAAIAAJ&q=chiniot&pg=PA38|title=Gazetteer of the Jhanq District|date=1884|publisher=Punjab Government Press|language=en}}</ref> alternatively spelt ''Chandniot,''<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U7imPH4KVJUC&q=chiniot&pg=PA60|title=Migration and Small Towns in Pakistan|last1=Hasan|first1=Arif|last2=Raza|first2=Mansoor|date=2009|publisher=IIED|isbn=9781843697343|language=en}}</ref> which was named in her honour. The name Chiniot, a contracted version of the original name, eventually gained favour,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ml5xAAAAMAAJ&q=chandniot|title=Journal of Central Asia|date=1992|publisher=Centre for the Study of the Civilizations of Central Asia, Quaid-i-Azam University|language=en}}</ref> though the older name had been used up until at least the 1860s.<ref name=":4" />

=== Mughal ===
During [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rule, Chiniot was governed as part of the ''[[subah]],'' or province, of [[Subah of Lahore|Lahore]]. The city reached its zenith during the reign of Mughal Emperor [[Shah Jahan]], and his governor of the area, Nawab Sadullah Khan of the ''Thahim'' tribe,<ref name=":1" /> who served between 1640 and 1656.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VzQzAAAAMAAJ&q=chiniot+history|title=Book on History of Ancient Arab Tribe Tamim|last=Thahim|first=Abdul Razak A.|date=1980|publisher=A.R.A. Thahim|language=en}}</ref> Under Sadullah Khan's governorship, Chiniot's famous [[Shahi Mosque]] was built.<ref name=":1" /> Chiniot's artisans were renowned for their skill during the Mughal era, and were employed in the decoration of the [[Taj Mahal]], and Lahore's [[Wazir Khan Mosque]].<ref name=":3" />

=== Mughal decline and Sial rule ===
Following the collapse of Mughal authority after the death of Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] in 1707, the local [[Sial tribe]], a tribe of Zamindar status, under the rule of Walidad Khan was officially granted governorship of the area on account of Khan's loyalty to the Delhi throne.<ref name=":1" /> Though nominally a part of the declining Mughal realm, Walidad Khan forged a largely independent state in western Punjab that controlled the region between [[Mankera]] and [[Kamalia]].<ref name=":1" /> Chiniot suffered heavily during the [[Durrani Empire|Durrani]] invasion of the late 1748.<ref name=":1" />

=== Sikh ===
The Sial state around Chiniot was encroached upon by [[Sikhism|Sikh]] chieftains in the north, and by [[Multan]]i chiefs in the south, before coming under the control of the [[Bhangi Misl]] Sikhs by 1765.<ref name=":1" /> The Sikhs imposed an annual tribute on the Sial chief, Inayatullah Khan, which he ceased paying in 1778 before also capturing Chiniot.<ref name=":1" /> He died in 1787, though the city had reverted to Bhangi Sikh rule before his death.<ref name=":1" />

The city suffered during the Sikh ''Misl'' states period in which the city region's Bhangis battled the [[Sukerchakia Misl|Sukerchakia ''Misl'']].<ref name=":1" /> Chiniot was captured by [[Ranjit Singh]] in 1803, and thereafter became part of the [[Sikh Empire]].<ref name=":1" /> The city was invested in Sial chief Ahmad Khan, who promised to pay tribute to Ranjit Singh's kingdom.<ref name=":1" /> Khan stopped paying tribute, and briefly seized full control of the region in 1808, but was decisively defeated by Ranjit Singh's forces in 1810.<ref name=":1" />

=== British ===
The city came under British rule by 1849, and the city was constituted as a municipality in 1862.<ref name=":1" /> In 1875, the city's population was 11,999.<ref name=":1" /> During the British period, a vast network of canals was laid to irrigate Punjab, resulting in the creation of many new "canal colonies" around Chiniot.<ref name=":3" /> Chiniot's famous [[Omar Hayat Mahal]] was built between 1923 and 1935 for a businessman who made his fortune in [[Calcutta]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1221723|title=Umar Hayat Mahal: Chiniot's dying 'wonder'|last=Ali|first=Aown|date=2015-12-03|work=Dawn|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US}}</ref>
