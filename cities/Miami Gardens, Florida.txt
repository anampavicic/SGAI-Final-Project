==History==
In the wake of the construction of [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]] in the late 1960s, many [[middle class|middle]]- and [[upper class|upper-income]] [[African American]] and [[West Indian American]] families [[black flight|migrated]] from [[Miami]] neighborhoods like [[Liberty City (Miami)|Liberty City]] to what became Miami Gardens (also called '''[[Carol City, Florida|Carol City]]''', '''[[Norland, Florida|Norland]]''', or '''[[Norwood, Florida|Norwood]]''') as race-based [[covenant (law)|covenant]]s were outlawed with the [[Fair Housing Act]], and mostly [[American lower class|lower income]] blacks moved into the Liberty City and [[Little Haiti]] neighborhoods surrounding [[Liberty Square (Miami)|Liberty Square]] and [[Edison Courts]].

Miami Gardens was incorporated on May 13, 2003.<ref name="Miami Gardens: Demographics"/> The city's [[neighborhood]]s of [[Andover, Florida|Andover]], [[Bunche Park, Florida|Bunche Park]], [[Carol City, Florida|Carol City]], [[Lake Lucerne, Florida|Lake Lucerne]], [[Norland, Florida|Norland]], [[Opa-locka North, Florida|Opa-locka North]], and [[Scott Lake, Florida|Scott Lake]] were previously [[unincorporated area]]s within [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]].

In 2007, Mayor [[Shirley Gibson]] said that the city would no longer allow any [[low-income housing]] developments; many residents blamed the developments for spreading crime and [[recreational drug]]s throughout the city. Around that time, the city's [[tax revenue]]s dropped to the third-lowest in Miami-Dade County.<ref name="Curse2">Garcia-Roberts, Gus. "The Curse." ''[[Miami New Times]]''. February 10, 2009.

==Police controversy==

In 2013, law enforcement abuses were alleged regarding the Miami Gardens Police Department by several news outlets.<ref>{{cite news |title=In Miami Gardens, store video catches cops in the act. |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/11/21/3769823_p4/in-miami-gardens-store-video-catches.html |first=Julie K.|last=Brown|author-link=Julie K.

Video evidence was gathered by the owner of the store, Ali Saleh, showing Miami Garden police involved in clear and repeated misconduct involving his employee, and customers.  According to the ''Miami Herald''{{'}}s [[Julie K. Brown]]:  "The videos show, among other things, cops stopping citizens, questioning them, aggressively searching them and arresting them for trespassing when they have permission to be on the premises".  It appeared Sampson had been arrested in this way due to police quotas, a department culture, and that Sampson was easy to arrest.  Sampson always pleaded guilty so they would let him out almost immediately, with one exception where he pleaded not guilty, and he was jailed for 20 days.  The guilty plea would validate the officers' improper arrest and increment their quota, so he became a continuous target.

===Volume of stops===

It was reported that, between 2008 and 2013, 99,980 stops occurred in Miami Gardens, involving 56,922 people, over half of the city's population.  In the City of Miami, 3,753 stops occurred during the same period, with four times the population.  Some stops involved children aged 5 to 7, totaling more than 1,000 children.  These numbers were compiled after news regarding Earl Sampson.<ref>{{cite news |title=Florida city's 'stop and frisk' nabs thousands of kids, finds 5-year-olds 'suspicious' |url=http://fusion.net/story/5568/florida-citys-stop-frisk-nabs-thousands-of-kids-finds-5-year-olds-suspicious/ |first1=Alice|last1=Brennan|first2=Dan|last2=Lieberman|publisher=Fusion |date=May 9, 2014 |access-date=February 21, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303105652/http://fusion.net/story/5568/florida-citys-stop-frisk-nabs-thousands-of-kids-finds-5-year-olds-suspicious/ |archive-date=March 3, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>
