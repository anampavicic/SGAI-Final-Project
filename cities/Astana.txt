The settlement of Akmoly was founded in 1830, possibly named after a local landmark—''Ақ мола'' literally means ''white grave'' in [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]]—although this theory is not universally accepted.{{sfn|Pospelov|1993|pp=24–25}} In 1832, it was granted town status and renamed Akmolinsk.{{sfn|Pospelov|1993|pp=24–25}} In 1961, under [[Nikita Khrushchev]], it was renamed Tselinograd, Russian for "City of [[Tselina|Virgin Lands]]".<ref name=":1" /> In 1991, following Kazakhstan's independence, the name was changed to Akmola.<ref name=":1" />

==History==
{{Main|History of Astana}}

=== Middle Ages (8th to 18th centuries)===
Many centuries ago, the Bozok settlement was located on the territory of modern Astana. It was a military fortress of the Steppe section of the [[Silk Road|Great Silk Road]]. The etymology of the Turkic word "Boz" carries several meanings such as 'untouched earth', 'virgin soil' and 'feather grass'. It was a large settlement of the 12-14th centuries. At present, Astana is expanding to the territory of ancient Bozok.<ref>{{cite web|author=From Bozok to a Modern Capital: the Long Journey Astana has Made Thus Far|title=From Bozok to a Modern Capital: The Long Journey Astana has Made Thus Far |url=https://e-history.kz/en/news/show/7144/|access-date=13 January 2015|publisher=e-history.kz}}</ref>

=== Early years (1830–1918) ===
The settlement of Akmoly was established on the [[Ishim River]] in 1830<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |last1=Curtis |first1=Simon |title=The Belt and Road City: Geopolitics, Urbanization, and China's Search for a New International Order |last2=Klaus |first2=Ian |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |isbn=9780300266900 |location=New Haven and London |publication-date=2024}}</ref>{{Rp|page=19}} as the seat of an [[okrug]]. In 1832, the settlement was granted town status and named ''Akmolinsk''.{{sfn|Pospelov|1993|pp=24–25}} The advantages of the position of the town were clear as early as 1863. It describes how picket roads and lines{{definition needed|date=June 2022}} connected this geographic center to [[Kargaly]] in the East, [[Aktau]] Fort in the South and through [[Atbasar]] to [[Kokshetau]] in the West. In 1838, at the height of the great national and liberation movement headed by [[Kenesary Khan]], the Akmolinsk Fortress was burned.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=e-history.kz|title=Revolt of 1837—1849 under the leadership of khan Kenesary|url=http://e-history.kz/en/contents/view/272|access-date=13 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114232603/http://e-history.kz/en/contents/view/272|archive-date=14 January 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> After the repression of the liberation movement, the fortress was rebuilt. On 16 July 1863, Akmolinsk was officially declared an [[uyezd]] town.<ref name="History of Astana">{{cite web|publisher=e-history.kz|title=History of Astana|url=http://e-history.kz/en/contents/view/380|access-date=13 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114232709/http://e-history.kz/en/contents/view/380|archive-date=14 January 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1869, Akmolinsk's  external district and department were cancelled, and Akmolinsk became the center of the newly established [[Akmolinsk Oblast (Russian Empire)|Akmolinsk Oblast]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} In 1879, Major General Dubelt proposed to build a railway between [[Tyumen]] and Akmolinsk to the Ministry of Communications of Russia. {{citation needed|date=March 2019}} In the course of the first 30 years of its existence, the population of Akmola numbered a trifle more than 2,000 people. However, over the next 30 years the city's population increased by three times according to [[volost]]s and [[Human settlement|settlements]] of the Akmolinsk Oblast. In 1893, Akmolinsk was an [[uyezd]] with a 6,428 strong population, 3 [[church (building)|churches]], 5 [[school]]s and [[college]]s and 3 [[Factory|factories]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

=== Soviet era (1918–1991) ===
During [[World War II]], Akmolinsk served as a route for the transport of engineering tools and equipment from evacuated [[Factory|plant]]s in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]], [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]], and [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] located in the [[oblast]]s of the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh SSR]]. Local industries were appointed to respond to war needs, assisting the country to provide the battle and home fronts with all materials needed. In the post-war years, Akmolinsk became a beacon of economic revival in the west of the [[Soviet Union]] ruined by the war. Additionally, many [[History of Germans in Russia, Ukraine and the Soviet Union|Russian-Germans]] were resettled here after being [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported]] under [[Joseph Stalin]]'s rule.<ref>{{cite web|author=S.

[[File:Astana (Kazakhstan), satellite image 2017-07-24.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite image of Astana and vicinities]]

Astana is almost {{cvt|1,000|km}} from the country's largest city and former capital, [[Almaty]]. The nearest big cities are [[Karaganda]] ({{cvt|200|km|disp=sqbr}}) and [[Omsk]] in Russia ({{cvt|450|km|disp=sqbr}}).{{cn|date=February 2024}}

===Topography===
Astana is located in central Kazakhstan on the [[Ishim River]] in a very flat, semi-arid steppe region which covers most of the country's territory. It is at 51° 10' north latitude and 71° 26' east longitude. The city encompasses {{convert|722.0|sqkm|1}}. The elevation of Astana is {{convert|347|m}} [[Metres above sea level|above sea level]]. Astana is in a spacious steppe landscape, in the transitional area between the north of Kazakhstan and the extremely thinly settled national centre, because of the Ishim River. The older boroughs lie north of the river, whilst the new boroughs are located south of the Ishim.{{cn|date=February 2024}}

=== Time ===
The [[UTC offset|time offset]] from the [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] used by Astana is 5 hours ahead of UTC, or [[UTC+05:00|UTC+5:00]].

===Climate===
Astana is the second-coldest national capital in the world after [[Ulaanbaatar]], Mongolia, a position formerly held by Canada's capital, [[Ottawa]], until Astana attained capital city status in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=The Mongolist|author=Brian White|title=Ulaanbaatar is the Coldest Capital|url=http://www.themongolist.com/blog/society/43-ulaanbaatar-is-the-coldest-capital.html|date=9 January 2013|access-date=19 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226225001/http://www.themongolist.com/blog/society/43-ulaanbaatar-is-the-coldest-capital.html|archive-date=26 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Canada.com |title=Still the third-coldest capital, despite balmy temperatures |url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=f23f6479-3274-493b-9f74-d8d8cb5418be |date=4 January 2007 |access-date=19 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606224805/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=f23f6479-3274-493b-9f74-d8d8cb5418be |archive-date=6 June 2015 |df=dmy}}</ref> Astana has an extreme continental climate with warm summers (featuring occasional brief rain showers) and long, very cold, dry winters.

Astana is subdivided into four districts. [[Almaty District]] was created on 6 May 1998 by presidential decree. The district's territory encompasses an area of {{convert|21054|ha|acre sqmi|abbr=off}} with a population of 375,938 people. The district has five villages. [[Yesil District]], which is also called left bank of the city, was created on 5 August 2008 by presidential decree. The district's territory encompasses an area of {{convert|31179|ha|acre sqmi|abbr=on}} with a population of 119,929 people. [[Saryarka District]] was created on 6 May 1998 by presidential decree. The district's territory encompasses an area of {{convert|19202|ha|acre sqmi|abbr=on}} with a population of 339,286 people. [[:ru:Байконурский район|Baykonyr District]] was created on 16 March 2018 by presidential decree. The district's territory encompasses an area of {{convert|18129|ha|acre sqmi|abbr=on}} with a population of 233 351 people.

In April 1998, the [[Government of Kazakhstan]] asked architects and [[urban planner]]s of international renown to participate in a design competition for the new capital. On 6 October 1998, Japanese architect [[Kisho Kurokawa]] was awarded the First Prize.{{sfn|Whyte|2000|p=216}} Kurokawa's proposal aimed to preserve and redevelop the existing city, and create a new city at the south and the east sides of the [[Ishim River]], enabling the Symbiosis of the History and the Future.{{sfn|Whyte|2000|p=216}}

North of the railway line, which crosses Astana in an east–west direction, are industrial and poorer residential areas. Between the railway line and the Ishim river is the city centre, where at present intense building activity is occurring. To the west and east are more elevated residential areas with parks and the new area of government administration to the south of the Ishim River. Here many large building projects are under way; for example, the construction of a diplomatic quarter, and government buildings. By 2030, these quarters are to be completed. Astana's chief planner, Vladimir Laptev, wants to build a [[Berlin]] in a [[Eurasia]]n style. He has stated that a purely administrative capital such as [[Canberra]] is not one of his goals.

Two of the most significant structures in Asatana's developing urban landscape are the [[Palace of Peace and Reconciliation]] and the [[Khan Shatyr Entertainment Center]].<ref name=":2" />{{Rp|page=20}} Their architectural styles are intended to echo features of the nomadic empires that shaped the history of the Eurasian steppes.<ref name=":2" />{{Rp|page=20}}

[[File:KZ 721 RC01 (44513246565).jpg|alt=|thumb|City bus in Astana]]

The city transport in Astana consists of buses and taxis. Over 720,000 people use public transport daily.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Astana Times|title=36 Buses Added to Astana's Most Popular Routes|author=Ainur Kuramyssova|url=http://www.astanatimes.com/2014/12/36-buses-added-astanas-popular-routes/|date=17 December 2014|access-date=23 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223181631/http://www.astanatimes.com/2014/12/36-buses-added-astanas-popular-routes/|archive-date=23 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> There are over 60 bus lines served by more than 1000 vehicles, with over 3000 people working in the public transport sector.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=world66.com|title=Astana Public Transportation|url=http://www.world66.com/asia/centralasia/kazakhstan/astana/getting_around|access-date=23 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223175643/http://www.world66.com/asia/centralasia/kazakhstan/astana/getting_around|archive-date=23 February 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Just like buses, share taxis have their own predefined routes and work on a shared basis.

Trolleybus routes were opened in 1983. There were originally 3 routes, however, by 2006, only one route was left. In 2008, the only trolleybus fleet by the special state commission was declared unprofitable due to debts to the energy supply company and as a result, it was completely closed.

In 2011, the Akimat of Astana established a company to implement a series of changes and programmes in the metropolis known as the "New transport system of Astana".<ref>{{cite web|publisher=International Association of Public Transport|title=Astana: an advancing city in the modern age|author=Yusup Khassiev|url=http://www.uitp.org/astana-advancing-city-modern-age|date=17 October 2012|access-date=23 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223172011/http://www.uitp.org/astana-advancing-city-modern-age|archive-date=23 February 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> As part of these programmes, [[bus rapid transit]] (BRT) lines were opened. That same year, the construction of a [[light rail]] (LRT) was to begin. It was planned that the first stage of construction of a 16.4-kilometer line, which would've included nine stations, was planned to be completed by 1 December 2013. However, as of May 2020, construction has not started. In November 2013, President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] condemned the construction of LRT because of the high cost. In exchange, there was a promise to launch high-speed buses. Despite the controversy, the construction of the LRT began in 2017 with the flyovers along to which the trains will pass. After a corruption scandal in 2019, the project stagnated until 2023, when construction resumed. The LRT is set to open in 2024-25.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kazakhstan splurges to get Astana light rail back on track |url=https://eurasianet.org/kazakhstan-splurges-to-get-astana-light-rail-back-on-track |website=eurasianet |access-date=20 May 2024}}</ref>

The bicycle-sharing program AstanaBike has been operating in Astana since 2014. In 2017, the system consisted of 40 stations with 1000 bicycles. The registration in the system for a season costs 5000 tenge ($28), plus a deposit for an RFID card ($5.50), the first half-hour of bike rental is free, the next hour is 100 tenge ($0.55). After more than 4 hours, the rent costs 1000 tenge.
