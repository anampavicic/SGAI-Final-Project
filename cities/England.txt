==Toponymy{{Anchor|Etymology}}==<!--linked-->
{{See also|Toponymy of England}}

The name "England" is derived from the [[Old English]] name {{Lang|ang|Englaland}}, which means "land of the [[Angles (tribe)|Angles]]".<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=England |encyclopedia=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=England |access-date=21 July 2010}}</ref> The Angles were one of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] that settled in Great Britain during the [[Early Middle Ages]]. They came from the [[Angeln]] region of what is now the German state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ripley|1869|p=570}}.</ref> The earliest recorded use of the term, as "{{Lang|ang|Engla londe}}", is in the late-ninth-century translation into Old English of [[Bede]]'s ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]''. The term was then used to mean "the land inhabited by the English", and it included English people in what is now south-east Scotland but was then part of the English kingdom of [[Northumbria]]. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' recorded that the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 covered the whole of England, meaning the English kingdom, but a few years later the ''Chronicle'' stated that King [[Malcolm III]] went "out of Scotlande into [[Lothian]] in Englaland", thus using it in the more ancient sense.{{sfn|Molyneaux|2015|pp=6–7}}

The earliest attested reference to the Angles occurs in the 1st-century work by [[Tacitus]], ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', in which the [[Latin]] word {{Lang|la|Anglii}} is used.<ref name="Fordham">{{Cite web |title=Germania |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/tacitus-germanygord.html |access-date=5 September 2009 |publisher=[[Tacitus]] |archive-date=16 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916075339/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/tacitus-germanygord.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> The etymology of the tribal name itself is disputed by scholars; it has been suggested that it derives from the shape of the Angeln peninsula, an ''angular'' shape.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Angle |encyclopedia=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50075354?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=Angle&first=1&max_to_show=10 |access-date=5 September 2009}}{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> How and why a term derived from the name of a tribe that was less significant than others, such as the [[Saxons]], came to be used for the entire country is not known, but it seems this is related to the custom of calling the Germanic people in Britain ''Angli Saxones'' or English Saxons to distinguish them from continental Saxons (Eald-Seaxe) of Old Saxony in Germany.<ref>{{harvnb|Crystal|2004|pp=26–27}}</ref> In [[Scottish Gaelic]], the Saxon tribe gave their name to the word for England ({{Lang|gd|Sasunn}});<ref>{{Cite book |last=Forbes |first=John |title=The Principles of Gaelic Grammar |publisher=Oliver, Boyd and Tweeddale |year=1848 |location=Edinburgh}}</ref> similarly, the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name for the English language is "{{Lang|cy|Saesneg}}". A romantic name for England is [[Lloegyr|Loegria]], related to the Welsh word for England, {{Lang|cy|Lloegr}}, and made popular by its use in [[Arthurian legend]]. ''[[Albion]]'' is also applied to England in a more poetic capacity,<ref>{{harvnb|Foster|1988|p=9}}.</ref> though its original meaning is the island of Britain as a whole.

[[File:London_-_British_Museum_-_2453.jpg|thumb|255x255px|The [[Battersea Shield]] is one of the most significant pieces of ancient [[Celtic art]] found in Britain.]]
During the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]], [[Celts|Celtic culture]], deriving from the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] and [[La Tène culture]]s, arrived from Central Europe. [[British language (Celtic)|Brythonic]] was the spoken language during this time. Society was tribal; according to [[Ptolemy]]'s {{Lang|la|[[Geographia]]}} there were around 20 tribes in the area. Like other regions on the edge of the Empire, Britain had long enjoyed trading links with the Romans. Julius Caesar of the [[Roman Republic]] attempted to [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|invade twice]] in 55&nbsp;BC; although largely unsuccessful, he managed to set up a [[Roman client kingdoms in Britain|client king]] from the [[Trinovantes]].

===Ancient history===

The Romans invaded Britain in 43 AD during the reign of Emperor [[Claudius]], subsequently [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquering much of Britain]], and the area was incorporated into the Roman Empire as [[Roman Britain|Britannia province]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Burke |first=Jason |date=2 December 2000 |title=Dig uncovers Boudicca's brutal streak |work=The Observer |location=London |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,406152,00.html |url-status=dead |access-date=5 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031022061846/http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0%2C6903%2C406152%2C00.html |archive-date=22 October 2003}}</ref> The best-known of the native tribes who attempted to resist were the [[Catuvellauni]] led by [[Caratacus]].

There is debate about when Christianity was first introduced; it was no later than the 4th century, probably much earlier. According to [[Bede]], missionaries were sent from Rome by [[Pope Eleuterus|Eleutherius]] at the request of the chieftain [[Lucius of Britain]] in 180 AD, to settle differences as to Eastern and Western ceremonials, which were disturbing the church. There are traditions linked to Glastonbury claiming an introduction through [[Joseph of Arimathea]], while others claim through Lucius of Britain.{{Sfn|Wright|2008|p=143}} By 410, during the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], Britain was left exposed by the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]] and the withdrawal of Roman army units, to defend the frontiers in continental Europe and partake in civil wars.<ref name="james_anglosaxons" /> Celtic Christian monastic and missionary movements flourished. This period of Christianity was influenced by ancient Celtic culture in its sensibilities, polity, practices and theology. Local "congregations" were centred in the monastic community and monastic leaders were more like chieftains, as peers, rather than in the more hierarchical system of the Roman-dominated church.<ref name="Lehane">{{Cite book |last=Lehane |first=Brendan |title=Early Christian Christianity |date=1968 |publisher=John Murray}}</ref>

During the settlement period the lands ruled by the incomers seem to have been fragmented into numerous tribal territories, but by the 7th century, when substantial evidence of the situation again becomes available, these had coalesced into roughly a dozen kingdoms including [[Northumbria]], [[Mercia]], [[Wessex]], [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]], [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]], [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] and [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]]. Over the following centuries, this process of political consolidation continued.{{Sfn|Kirby|2000|p=4}} The 7th century saw a struggle for hegemony between Northumbria and Mercia, which in the 8th century gave way to Mercian preeminence.{{Sfn|Lyon|1960|p=23}} In the early 9th century Mercia was displaced as the foremost kingdom by Wessex. Later in that century escalating attacks by the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] culminated in the conquest of the north and east of England, overthrowing the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and East Anglia. Wessex under [[Alfred the Great]] was left as the only surviving English kingdom, and under his successors, it steadily expanded at the expense of the kingdoms of the [[Danelaw]]. This brought about the political unification of England, first accomplished under [[Æthelstan]] in 927 and definitively established after further conflicts by [[Eadred]] in 953. A fresh wave of Scandinavian attacks from the late 10th century ended with the conquest of this united kingdom by [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] in 1013 and again by his son [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] in 1016, turning it into the centre of a short-lived [[North Sea Empire]] that also included [[Kingdom of Denmark|Denmark]] and [[Norway]]. However, the native royal dynasty was restored with the accession of [[Edward the Confessor]] in 1042.

In contrast with much of European [[Protestantism]], the [[English Reformation|roots of the split]] were more political than theological.{{Efn|As [[Roger Scruton]] explains, "The Reformation must not be confused with the changes introduced into the Church of England during the "Reformation Parliament" of 1529–36, which were of a political rather than a religious nature, designed to unite the secular and religious sources of authority within a single sovereign power: the Anglican Church did not make substantial change in doctrine until later."{{Sfn|Scruton|1982|p=470}}}} He also legally incorporated his ancestral land Wales into the Kingdom of England with the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542|1535–1542 acts]]. There were internal religious conflicts during the reigns of Henry's daughters, [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] and [[Elizabeth I]]. The former took the country back to Catholicism while the latter broke from it again, forcefully asserting the supremacy of [[Anglicanism]]. The [[Elizabethan era]] is the epoch in the Tudor age of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I ("the Virgin Queen"). Historians often depict it as the [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] in English history that represented the apogee of the English Renaissance and saw the flowering of great art, drama, poetry, music and literature.<ref>From the 1944 Clark lectures by [[C.

Competing with [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], the first English colony in the Americas was founded in 1585 by explorer [[Walter Raleigh]] in [[Virginia]] and named [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]].

During the Elizabethan period, England was at war with Spain. An [[Spanish Armada|armada]] sailed from Spain in 1588 as part of a wider plan to invade England and re-establish a Catholic monarchy. The plan was thwarted by bad coordination, stormy weather and successful harrying attacks by an English fleet under [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Lord Howard of Effingham]]. This failure did not end the threat: Spain launched two further armadas, in [[2nd Spanish Armada|1596]] and [[3rd Spanish Armada|1597]], but both were driven back by storms.

{{Main|English law}}
[[File:Royal Courts of Justice (6201094569).jpg|thumb|The [[Royal Courts of Justice]]|left]]

Despite now being part of the United Kingdom, the legal system of the [[Courts of England and Wales]] continued, under the [[Treaty of Union]], as a separate legal system from [[Scots law|the one used in Scotland]].

The court system is headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales, consisting of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], the [[High Court of Justice]] for civil cases, and the [[Crown Court]] for criminal cases.<ref>{{harvnb|Fafinski|2007|p=127}}.</ref> The [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] is the highest court for criminal and civil cases in [[England and Wales]].

The [[subdivisions of England]] consist of up to four levels of [[administrative division|subnational division]], controlled through a variety of types of administrative entities created for the purposes of [[local government in England|local government]].

Outside the London region, England's highest tier is the 48 [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]].<ref name="britannicagov">{{harvnb|Encyclopædia Britannica|2002|p=100}}</ref> These are used primarily as a geographical frame of reference. Of these, 38 developed gradually since the [[Middle Ages]]; these were reformed to 51 in 1974 and to their current number in 1996.<ref name="maud">{{harvnb|Redcliffe-Maud|Wood|1974}}.</ref> Each has a [[Lord Lieutenant]] and [[High Sheriff]]; these posts are used to represent the [[British monarch]] locally.<ref name="britannicagov" /> Some counties, such as [[Herefordshire]], are only divided further into civil parishes. The royal county of Berkshire and the metropolitan counties have different types of status to other ceremonial counties.<ref>{{Cite web |last=www.abcounties.com |date=2013-06-26 |title=The problem of 'county confusion' – and how to resolve it |url=https://abcounties.com/counties/county-confusion/ |access-date=2023-09-17 |website=Association of British Counties}}</ref>

The second tier is made up of [[combined authorities]] and the 27 [[County Council|county-tier]] [[shire counties]]. In 1974, all ceremonial counties were two-tier; and with the metropolitan county tier phased out, the 1996 reform separated the ceremonial county and the administrative county tier.

England is also divided into local government districts.<ref name="localgov">{{harvnb|Singh|2009|p=53}}.</ref> The district can align to a ceremonial county, or be a district tier within a [[shire counties|shire county]], be a [[royal borough|royal]] or [[metropolitan borough]], have [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough]] or [[city status in the United Kingdom|city status]], or be a [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority]].

At the community level, much of England is divided into [[civil parishes in England|civil parishes]] with their own [[Parish councils in England|councils]]; in Greater London only one such parish, [[Queen's Park, London|Queen's Park]], exists {{as of|2014|lc=y}} after they were [[London Government Act 1963|abolished in 1965]] until legislation [[Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007|allowed their recreation]] in 2007.

Ceremonially and administratively, the region is divided between the [[City of London]] and [[Greater London]]; these are further divided into the 32 [[London Boroughs]] and the 25 [[Wards of the City of London]].<ref>{{harvnb|Axford|2002|p=315}}.</ref>

Most of England's landscape consists of low hills and plains, with upland and mountainous terrain in the north and west of the country. The northern uplands include the [[Pennines]], a chain of uplands dividing east and west, the Lake District mountains in Cumbria, and the [[Cheviot Hills]], straddling the border between England and Scotland. The highest point in England, at {{convert|978|m|ft}}, is [[Scafell Pike]] in the Lake District.<ref name="metoffice_nw" /> The [[Shropshire Hills]] are near Wales while [[Dartmoor]] and [[Exmoor]] are two upland areas in the south-west of the country.

The Pennines, known as the "backbone of England", are the oldest range of mountains in the country, originating from the end of the [[Paleozoic Era]] around 300&nbsp;million years ago.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pennines |url=http://www.summitpost.org/area/range/220026/pennines.html |access-date=8 September 2009 |publisher=Smmit Post}}</ref> Their geological composition includes, among others, [[sandstone]] and [[limestone]], and also coal. There are [[karst]] landscapes in calcite areas such as parts of [[Yorkshire]] and [[Derbyshire]]. The Pennine landscape is high [[moorland]] in upland areas, indented by fertile valleys of the region's rivers. They contain two [[national parks in England|national parks]], the [[Yorkshire Dales]] and the [[Peak District]]. In the [[West Country]], Dartmoor and Exmoor of the Southwest Peninsula include upland moorland supported by granite.<ref>{{Cite web |title=National Parks&nbsp;– About us |url=http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/aboutus |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027162402/http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/aboutus |archive-date=27 October 2010 |access-date=5 December 2010 |publisher=nationalparks.gov.uk}}</ref>

The [[English Lowlands beech forests|English Lowlands]] are in the central and southern regions of the country, consisting of green rolling hills, including the [[Cotswold Hills]], [[Chiltern Hills]], [[North Downs|North]] and [[South Downs]]; where they meet the sea they form white rock exposures such as the [[cliffs of Dover]].

It resulted in a Church that consciously retained a large amount of continuity with the Church of the Patristic and Medieval periods in terms of its use of the catholic creeds, its pattern of ministry, its buildings and aspects of its liturgy, but which also embodied Protestant insights in its theology and in the overall shape of its liturgical practice. The way that this is often expressed is by saying that the Church of England is both 'catholic and reformed.'}}</ref>

There are [[High Church]] and [[Low Church]] traditions and some Anglicans regard themselves as [[Anglo-Catholics]], following the [[Tractarian movement]]. The monarch of the United Kingdom is the [[supreme governor of the Church of England]], which has around 26&nbsp;million baptised members (of whom the vast majority are not regular churchgoers).

[[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Early medieval architecture]]'s secular buildings were simple constructions mainly using timber with [[thatch]] for roofing. Ecclesiastical architecture ranged from a synthesis of [[Early Christian Ireland|Hiberno]]–[[Germanic Christianity|Saxon]] [[monasticism]],<ref>{{harvnb|Colgrave|1985|p=326}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Pevsner|1942|p=14}}.</ref> to [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian]] [[basilica]] and architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, baluster shafts and triangular headed openings. After the Norman conquest in 1066 various [[castles in England|castles]] were created; the best known include the [[Tower of London]], [[Warwick Castle]], [[Durham Castle]] and [[Windsor Castle]].<ref name="buildings" />

Throughout the Plantagenet era, an [[English Gothic architecture]] flourished, with prime examples including the [[Architecture of the medieval cathedrals of England|medieval cathedrals]] such as [[Canterbury Cathedral]], [[Westminster Abbey]] and [[York Minster]].<ref name="buildings">{{harvnb|Atkinson|2008|p=189}}.</ref> Expanding on the [[Norman architecture|Norman base]] there was also [[castle]]s, [[palace]]s, [[List of historic houses in England|great houses]], universities and [[parish church]]es. Medieval architecture was completed with the 16th-century [[Tudor architecture|Tudor style]]; the four-centred arch, now known as the [[Tudor arch]], was a defining feature as were [[wattle and daub]] houses domestically. In the aftermath of the [[Renaissance]] a form of architecture echoing classical antiquity synthesised with Christianity appeared, the [[English Baroque]] style of architect [[Christopher Wren]] being particularly championed.<ref>{{harvnb|Downes|2007|p=17}}.</ref>

[[Georgian architecture]] followed in a more refined style, evoking a simple Palladian form; the [[Royal Crescent]] at Bath is one of the best examples of this. With the emergence of [[romanticism]] during Victorian period, a [[Gothic Revival]] was launched. In addition to this, around the same time the Industrial Revolution paved the way for buildings such as [[The Crystal Palace]].

Landscape gardening, as developed by [[Capability Brown]], set an international trend for the [[English garden|English landscape garden]]. Gardening, and visiting gardens, are regarded as typically English pursuits. The English garden presented an idealized view of nature. At large country houses, the English garden usually included lakes, sweeps of gently rolling lawns set against groves of trees, and recreations of classical temples, [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] ruins, bridges, and other picturesque architecture, designed to recreate an idyllic pastoral landscape.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|title=Gardens through time|url=https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/learn/histories/gardens-through-time/|access-date=10 April 2021|website=English Heritage}}</ref>

By the end of the 18th century, the English garden was being imitated by the [[French landscape garden]], and as far away as [[Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg]], the gardens of the future [[Emperor Paul]]. It also had a major influence on the [[public parks]] and gardens which appeared around the world in the 19th century.<ref>Lucia Impelluso, ''Jardins, potagers et labyrinthes'', Mondatori Electra, Milan</ref> The English landscape garden was centred on the [[English country house]] and manor houses.<ref name=":2" />

English folklore developed over many centuries. Some of the characters and stories are present across England, but most belong to specific regions. Common folkloric beings include [[pixie]]s, [[giant (mythology)|giants]], [[elf|elves]], [[bogeymen]], [[troll]]s, [[goblin]]s and [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]].

The traditional [[folk music of England]] is centuries old and has contributed to several genres prominently; mostly [[sea shanties]], [[jig]]s, [[hornpipe]]s and [[dance music]]. It has its own distinct variations and regional peculiarities. Ballads featuring Robin Hood, printed by [[Wynkyn de Worde]] in the 16th century, are an important artefact, as are [[John Playford]]'s ''[[The Dancing Master]]'' and [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley's]] ''[[Roxburghe Ballads]]'' collections.<ref>{{harvnb|Chappell|1966|p=690}}.</ref> Some of the best-known songs are ''[[Greensleeves]]'', ''[[Pastime with Good Company]]'', ''[[Maggie May (folk song)|Maggie May]]'' and ''[[Spanish Ladies]]'' among others. Many [[nursery rhymes]] are of English origin such as ''[[Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary]]'', ''[[Roses Are Red]]'', ''[[Jack and Jill (nursery rhyme)|Jack and Jill]]'', ''[[London Bridge Is Falling Down]], [[The Grand Old Duke of York]], [[Hey Diddle Diddle]]'' and ''[[Humpty Dumpty]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Lax|1989|p=7}}.</ref> Traditional English Christmas carols include "[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]", "[[The First Noel]]", "[[I Saw Three Ships]]" and "[[God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen]]".

Early English composers in classical music include Renaissance artists [[Thomas Tallis]] and [[William Byrd]], followed by [[Henry Purcell]] from the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]] and [[Thomas Arne]] who was well known for his patriotic song [[Rule, Britannia!]]. German-born [[George Frideric Handel]] spent most of his composing life in London and became a national icon in Britain, creating some of the most well-known works of classical music, especially his English oratorios, ''[[Messiah (Handel)|The Messiah]]'', ''[[Solomon (Handel)|Solomon]]'', ''[[Water Music (Handel)|Water Music]]'', and ''[[Music for the Royal Fireworks]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Birth of British Music: Handel – The Conquering Hero |publisher=BBC |date=15 July 2019 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00kntl1|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170514114225/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00kntl1|archive-date=14 May 2017}}</ref>[[File:The Beatles arrive at JFK Airport.jpg|thumb|[[The Beatles]] are the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed band in popular music.<ref>{{cite news |url={{GBurl|id=rdU1xtIWJz0C|q=The Beatles have sold around 1&nbsp;billion records and cassettes}} |title=The Guinness Book of Records 1999 |isbn=9780851120706 |last1=Kynaston |first1=Nic |year=1998|publisher=Guinness }}</ref>]]

Classical music attracted much attention in the 18th century with the formation of the [[Birmingham Triennial Music Festival]], which was the longest running classical music festival of its kind until the final concerts in 1912. The [[English Musical Renaissance]] was a hypothetical development in the late 19th and early 20th century, when English composers, often those lecturing or trained at the [[Royal College of Music]], were said to have freed themselves from foreign musical influences. There was a revival in the profile of composers from England in the 20th century led by [[Edward Elgar]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[Frederick Delius]], [[Gustav Holst]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] and others.<ref>{{harvnb|Stradling|1993|p=166}}.</ref> Present-day composers from England include [[Michael Nyman]], best known for ''[[The Piano]]'', and [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], whose musicals have achieved enormous success in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and worldwide.

In [[popular music]], many English bands and solo artists have been cited as the most influential and best-selling musicians of all time.

The St George's Cross has been the national [[flag of England]] since the 13th century. Originally, the flag was used by the maritime [[Republic of Genoa]]. The English monarch paid a tribute to the [[Doge of Genoa]] from 1190 onwards so that English ships could fly the flag as a means of protection when entering the Mediterranean.
A red cross was a symbol for many [[Crusaders]] in the 12th and 13th centuries, and became associated with [[Saint George]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannia.com/history/stgeorge.html |title=St. George&nbsp;– England's Patron Saint |publisher=Britannia.com |access-date=1 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308175508/http://www.britannia.com/history/stgeorge.html |archive-date=8 March 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Since 1606 the St George's Cross has formed part of the design of the [[Union Flag]], a Pan-British flag designed by King [[James I of England|James I]].<ref name="flaghistory" /> During the [[English Civil War]] and [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]], the [[New Model Army]]'s standards and the [[English Commonwealth|Commonwealth's]] [[Great Seal of the Realm#Commonwealth|Great Seal]] both incorporated the flag of Saint George.<ref>{{cite book|last=Good|first=Jonathan|title=The Cult of Saint George in Medieval England |url={{GBurl|id=dP8LAQAAMAAJ}} |page=149 |year=2009 |publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=978-1-84383-469-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Great Seal of the Commonwealth of England, 1651 |website=Getty Images |date=18 January 2014 |url=https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/the-great-seal-of-the-commonwealth-of-england-1651-news-photo/463967983 |access-date=27 October 2018}}</ref>

There are numerous other symbols and symbolic artefacts, both official and unofficial, including the [[Tudor rose]], the nation's [[national emblem|floral emblem]], and the Three Lions featured on the [[Royal Arms of England]]. The Tudor rose was adopted as a national emblem of England around the time of the [[Wars of the Roses]] as a symbol of peace.<ref name="Flowers">{{cite web |url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page828 |title=National flowers |date=13 January 2003 |publisher=Number10.gov.uk |access-date=8 August 2009 |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080909053639/http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page828 |archive-date=9 September 2008}}</ref> It is a [[syncreticism|syncretic]] symbol in that it merged the white rose of the [[House of York|Yorkists]] and the red rose of the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrians]].

[[File:Royal Arms of England (1198-1340).svg|thumb|upright|alt=A red shield tapers to its bottom end; on it are three stylised golden lions with blue claws.|The [[Royal Arms of England]]]]
The Royal Arms of England, a national [[coat of arms]] featuring three lions, originated with [[Richard the Lionheart]] in 1198. It is [[blazon]]ed as ''gules, three lions passant guardant or'' and it provides one of the most prominent symbols of England. England does not have an official national anthem, as the United Kingdom as a whole has ''[[God Save the King]]''. However, ''[[Jerusalem (hymn)|Jerusalem]]'', ''[[Land of Hope and Glory]]'' (used for England during the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]]),<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/143569 |title=Jason Cowley loves the Commonwealth Games |work=New Statesman |access-date=5 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011102925/https://www.newstatesman.com/node/143569 |archive-date=11 October 2013 }}</ref> and ''[[I Vow to Thee, My Country]]'' are often considered unofficial [[National anthem of England|English national anthems]]. England's [[National Day]] is 23 April which is [[St George's Day in England|Saint George's Day]]: Saint George is the patron saint of England.<ref name="St. George">{{cite news |date=23 April 1998 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/82166.stm |title=The Great Saint George Revival |work=BBC News |access-date=5 September 2009}}</ref>
