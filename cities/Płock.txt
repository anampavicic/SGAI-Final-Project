==History==
{{Main|Timeline of Płock}}

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Diadem of Płock.PNG|thumb|left|[[Płock Diadem]], 13th century]]
The area was long inhabited by pagan peoples. In the 10th century, a [[Castle of the Masovian Dukes in Płock|fortified location]] was established high of the Vistula River's bank. This location was at a junction of shipping and trade routes and was strategic for centuries. Its location was a great asset. In 1009 a [[Benedictine]] [[monastery]] was established here. It became a center of science and art for the area.

During the rule of the first monarchs of the [[Piast dynasty]], even prior to the [[Baptism of Poland]], Płock served as one of the monarchial seats, including that of Prince [[Mieszko I]] and King [[Bolesław I the Brave]]. The king built the original fortifications on Cathedral Hill ({{langx|pl|Wzgórze Tumskie}}), overlooking the [[Vistula|Vistula River]]. From 1037 to 1047, Płock was capital of the independent Mazovian state of [[Miecław]]. Płock has been the residence of many Mazovian princes. In 1075, a [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Płock|diocese]] seat was created here for the Roman Catholic church.<ref name=pwn>{{cite web|url=https://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo/Plock;3958401.html|title=Płock|website=Encyklopedia PWN|access-date=11 July 2020|language=pl}}</ref> From 1079 to 1138, during the reign of the [[Polish monarchs]] [[Władysław I Herman]] and [[Bolesław III Wrymouth]], the city was [[List of former national capitals|the capital of Poland]], then earning its title as the Ducal Capital City of Płock ({{langx|pl|Stołeczne Książęce Miasto Płock}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ump.pl/en/main.php?cid=poznaj&iid=getknow |title=Get to know Płock |publisher=From official Płock website.en |access-date=2011-02-17}}</ref> As a result of the fragmentation of Poland into smaller duchies, from 1138 it was the capital of the [[Duchy of Masovia]], and afterwards the Duchy of Płock.<ref name=pwn/> In 1180 the present-day [[Marshal Stanisław Małachowski High School, Płock|Marshal Stanisław Małachowski High School]] (''Małachowianka''), the oldest still existing school in Poland and one of the oldest in [[Central Europe]], was established.<ref name=MAL>{{cite web|url=http://malachowianka.plock.org.pl/historia_plocka/|title=Z dziejów Płocka|website=Małachowianka OnLine|access-date=1 September 2019|language=pl}}</ref> Among its notable graduates is scholar and jurist [[Paweł Włodkowic]], a precursor of [[religious freedom]] in Europe, who studied there in the late 14th century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Erlich |first=Ludwik |date=1968 |title=Pisma wybrane Pawła Włodkowica (Preface) |location=Warsaw |publisher=PAX |page=13 }}</ref>

The Germans renamed the city ''Schröttersburg'' in 1941 after the former Prussian Baron of the Empire [[Friedrich von Schrötter|Friedrich Leopold von Schrötter]].<ref>[[:de:Landkreis Schröttersburg]]</ref>

As part of the ''[[Intelligenzaktion]]'', Germans carried out mass arrests of Poles, who were then imprisoned in the local prison, and around 200 of whom were murdered in large massacres in [[Łąck]] between October 1939 and February 1940.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wardzyńska|first=Maria|year=2009|title=Był rok 1939.

At the same time, the Nazis were also brutalizing the Jewish population of Płock. They conscripted them for forced labor and established a [[Jewish ghettos in German-occupied Poland|Jewish ghetto]] in Płock in 1940. In that ghetto, up to ten people shared each room. Medical supplies were inadequate and diseases spread. Germans murdered many Jews in Płock but most were deported to other areas and then on to be murdered in [[Treblinka]]. By the war's end, only 300 Jewish residents were known to have survived, of more than 10,000 in the region (for more information see ''Jewish history'' below). Some Poles in Płock tried to assist their Jewish neighbors by smuggling food to them and sneaking food to them when they were rounded up and had to stand in the street for an entire day on a bitterly cold day waiting to be deported.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Megargee |first1=Geoffrey |title=Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos |date=2012 |publisher=University of Indiana Press |location=Bloomington, Indiana |isbn=978-0-253-35599-7 |page=Volume II 22–24}}</ref>

==Religion==

===Catholic Church===
[[File:Sanktuarium Miłosierdzia Bożego w Płocku.jpg|thumb|[[Divine Mercy Sanctuary (Płock)|Divine Mercy Sanctuary]]]]
Płock is the oldest legislated seat of the Roman Catholic [[diocese]]; the [[Masovian Blessed Virgin Mary Cathedral]] was built here in the first half of the 12th century and houses the [[sarcophagi]] of Polish monarchs. It is one of the five oldest cathedrals in Poland.

Moreover, the city is famous for the [[Divine Mercy Sanctuary (Płock)|Divine Mercy Sanctuary]], where the apparition of Jesus to Saint [[Faustina Kowalska]] is reported to have taken place, and the [[Divine Mercy (Catholic devotion)|Divine Mercy]] devotion was revealed.<ref>[http://www.milosierdzieplock.pl/eng Shrine of the Divine Mercy in Plock]</ref>

===Mariavite Church===
[[File:Swiatynia w plocku.JPG|thumb|Interior of the [[Temple of Mercy and Charity]] - seat of the [[Mariavite Church|Mariavite]] bishops]]
From the visions of [[Feliksa Kozłowska]] in 1893, the Mariavite order of priests originated, originally working to renew clergy within the Roman Catholic Church. Despite repeated attempts, they were not recognized by the Vatican and in the early 20th century established a separate and independent denomination. This site is the main seat of the [[Mariavite Church|Mariavite]] [[bishop]]s. Their most important church was built here in the beginning of the 20th century; it is called the [[Temple of Mercy and Charity]] and is situated in a pleasant garden on the hill on which the historical centre of Płock is built, near the [[Vistula River]]. Poland in total has about 25,000 members of the Old Catholic Mariavite Church, as it is now named, with another 5,000 in France. A smaller breakaway church, the [[Catholic Mariavite Church]], which has an integrated female priesthood (since 1929), has 3,000 members in Poland.

===Jewish history===
The Jewish presence in Płock ([[Yiddish]]: ''Plotzk'') dates back many centuries, probably to the 13th and 14th centuries, when records include them. The Polish kings extended rights to them in 1264 and the 14th century, and provided continued political support through the centuries.<ref name="JewishHistory"/> At the beginning of the 19th century, their more than 1,200 residents comprised more than 48% of the city's population in what is considered the city's Old Town; through the century, their proportions ranged from 30 and 40 percent.<ref name="people"/> It varied as German migrants were arriving in the region, and the area was becoming urbanized, as more people moved to the city. After Płock fell to [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in the 19th century, it was part of the [[Pale of Settlement]], where Russians allowed the settlement of Jews. As in other parts of the [[Russian Partition]] of Poland, they were restricted to employment in trades and crafts.<ref name="JewishHistory">[http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/plock/5,history/?action=view&page=2 Plock: Jewish Community before 1989] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213014407/http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/plock/5,history/?action=view&page=2 |date=13 December 2014 }}, Virtual Shtetl, accessed 28 October 2013</ref>
[[File:2013 Small Synagogue in Płock - 02.jpg|thumb|Small Synagogue]]

In the late 19th century, Moszek Szlama Sarna (1838–1908) established two [https://jewishplock.eu/en/48-sienkiewicza-street-the-factory-of-the-sarna-family/ factories] to produce farm machines and tools, and the first iron foundry in the city. The Jewish community had two synagogues and two cemeteries (dating to the 15th century), religious and secular schools, and established a library and hospital. They contributed strongly to the economy and culture of the city. In the early 20th century,and had two newspapers, representing active political parties.<ref name="JewishHistory"/>

In 1939, Płock had a Jewish population of 9,000, an estimated 26% of the city's total.<ref name="people"/> After the 1939 [[invasion of Poland]], German Nazi persecution began, about 2,000 Jews fled the city, with half going to Soviet-controlled territory. They were assigned to locations far from the front. In 1940, the Nazis established a [[ghetto]] in Płock. They started actions against the Jews, killing those in an old people's home and sick children, and transporting others to be killed at Brwilski Forest. Ultimately, they transported the Jews to 20 camps and sites in the Radom district, where in 1942 those still alive were sent to Treblinka to be murdered.<ref name="JewishHistory"/> There is evidence that a few Poles tried to help their Jewish neighbors in Plock by smuggling food into the ghetto, sneaking food to them while they were awaiting deportation, and throwing loaves of bread to them on the transport trucks. While small acts, they took courage.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Megargee |first1=Geoffrey |title=Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos |date=2012 |publisher=University of Indiana Press |location=Bloomington, Indiana |isbn=978-0-253-35599-7 |page=Volume II, 22–23}}</ref> By 1946, only 300 Jews survived in Płock.

The small synagogue, built in 1810, was one of the few to survive [[World War II]] in the Masovia region of Poland. The Great Synagogue was destroyed during the Holocaust. The small synagogue was designated as a historic building about 1960, but deteriorated in physical condition while vacant. It was renovated and adapted for use as a museum, opening in April 2013 as the Museum of Masovian Jews, a branch of the Museum of Płock Mazowiecki.<ref>[http://samgrubersjewishartmonuments.blogspot.com/2013/03/poland-pock-synagogue-reopens-as-museum.html Samuel D.
