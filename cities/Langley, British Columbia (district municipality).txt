The '''Township of Langley''' is a [[district municipality]] immediately east of the [[Surrey, British Columbia|City of Surrey]] in southwestern [[British Columbia]], Canada. It extends south from the [[Fraser River]] to the [[Canada–United States border]], and west of the [[City of Abbotsford]]. Langley Township is not to be confused with the [[City of Langley]], which is adjacent to the township but politically is a separate entity. Langley is located in the eastern part of [[Metro Vancouver]].

== History ==
{{Needs more references|section|date=October 2022}}

=== First Nations ===
Throughout the last several millennia, the area that is now Langley Township was inhabited by various [[Stó꞉lō]] nations, including the [[Katzie]] and [[Kwantlen First Nation|Kwantlen]]. There is limited recorded history from this time, as much was passed down through [[oral tradition]] rather than written documents. The Kwantlen were a major factor in the salmon trade that later operated out of the [[Fort Langley]].<ref>{{Cite news |last= |date=August 1, 2008 |title=First Nation learns from the past |url=http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=3ceeaf41-f877-4671-aff3-f097c8880d47 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324042233/http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=3ceeaf41-f877-4671-aff3-f097c8880d47 |archivedate=March 24, 2016 |website=Canada.com}}</ref> Simon Fraser, while traveling through the Sto:lo territory in 1808 recorded the image of a Kwantlen village: <blockquote>Their houses are built of cedar planks and in shape, similar to the one already described, the whole range, which is six hundred and forty feet long by sixty broad, is under one roof, the front is eighteen feet high and the covering is slanting: all the apartments which are separated by partitions are square, except the Chief's, which is ninety feet long. In this room the posts or pillars are nearly three feet in diameter at the base and diminish gradually to the top. In one of these posts is an oval opening answering the purpose of the door through which one man may crawl in or out. Above, on the outside, are carved human figures as large as life, with other figures in imitation of beasts and birds.<ref>{{Cite web |title=KwantlenFN.ca History |url=http://www.kwantlenfn.ca/html/history.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805042717/http://www.kwantlenfn.ca/html/history.html |archivedate=August 5, 2013}}</ref> </blockquote>

=== Fort Langley (1827–1955) ===
[[Image:Langley Train Station.jpg|left|thumb|[[Canadian National Railway|C.N.R.]] Locomotive at the Langley Railway Station, 1924]]
The first Europeans to stay in the area permanently were the traders of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC). In 1827, [[Fort Langley National Historic Site|Fort Langley]] was built on the banks of the Fraser River, in the area now known as [[Derby, British Columbia|Derby Reach]]. It was one of a string of trading posts built along the Pacific Coast to compete with American fur traders for the rich pelts available in the region. Farming as well as cranberry and salmon exports soon replaced fur trading as the fort's primary source of income.
[[File:Fort langley nhs 1.jpg|thumb|Inside the 1839 fort at Fort Langley National Historic Site]]
The first fort (1827-1839), built with two bastions, a wooden stockade and several buildings, proved to have been built too close to a fast-moving part of the river, in an area prone to flooding. It was rebuilt in 1839 farther upstream. As the HBC's network of forts in the interior grew, Fort Langley became a hub for farming, smithing and for shipping furs back to Europe. Along with farming, the export of cranberries and salmon would soon become the fort's main source of profit.

In 1858, [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush|gold was discovered]] in the Fraser River in what is now the [[interior of British Columbia]], and the fort also became important as a supply station for the miners heading up the river toward the gold fields. With thousands of gold prospectors, many of them American, streaming into the region, the British government created [[Colony of British Columbia (1858–1866)|British Columbia]] as a colony. [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]] was sworn in as the new colony's first governor in Fort Langley, but [[New Westminster]] was chosen as the capital, as Fort Langley was less defensible from an American invasion.

When the gold rush ended, Fort Langley's importance began to decline. The Hudson's Bay Company subdivided and sold the farm it was occupying on Langley Prairie. Farming and logging took over as the dominant local industries.

In 1870, Paul Murray settled what is known today as [[Murrayville, Langley|Murrayville]]. Together with his sons he owned a [[Dominion Land Survey#Sections|quarter section]] of land on each of the four corners of Yale Road and what now is 216th Street. At that time, this area became known as "Murrays corner" after Alexander Murray, who drowned in the Fraser River in January 1884 while attempting in vain to save a friend. In 1925, the post office named it "Murrayville". The area between 216 street, 216A street, 48th ave and 48A avenue is one of the oldest subdivisions in Langley. Of the eight building lots in this subdivision there are still 6 heritage houses (built before 1930).

The Township of Langley was incorporated on April 26, 1873, with James W. Mackie as its first elected warden. Over time, New Westminster and then [[Vancouver]] developed into urban centres, but Langley Township remained predominantly a rural community.

The growth of transportation continued to connect Langley Township with its surroundings. The [[British Columbia Electric Railway]] was built through the community in 1910, followed by [[Fraser Highway]] in the 1920s, and the construction of the [[Pattullo Bridge]] in 1937, all adding to Langley's importance.

These developments impacted the Langley Prairie area in particular, transforming it into the Township's main urban and commercial core.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://city.langley.bc.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/Services/Getting_to_Know_City_of_Langley.pdf|title=Getting to Know The City of Langley|website=City of Langley|access-date=2019-07-26|archive-date=2021-04-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210421132418/https://city.langley.bc.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/Services/Getting_to_Know_City_of_Langley.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> In turn, this birthed the need for upgraded and new amenities, especially with respect to health, infrastructure, safety and sanitation, in the neighbourhood. The municipal government, however, refused to finance these projects as it bowed, instead, to politically influential farming communities and smaller, mostly rural, business centres, like Fort Langley, [[Milner, British Columbia|Milner]] and Murrayville, that viewed such spending as unnecessary.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.langleyadvancetimes.com/opinion/odd-thoughts-divorce-was-inevitable-even-in-langley-back-in-the-day/|title=ODD THOUGHTS: Divorce was inevitable – even in Langley back in the day|last=Groeneveld|first=Bob|date=2017-10-30|work=Langley Advance Times|access-date=2019-07-26|archive-date=2019-07-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190726074507/https://www.langleyadvancetimes.com/opinion/odd-thoughts-divorce-was-inevitable-even-in-langley-back-in-the-day/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{cite web|url=https://www.vancouverhistory.ca/chronology1955.htm|title=The History of Metropolitan Vancouver|website=The History of Metropolitan Vancouver|access-date=2019-07-26|archive-date=2019-07-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190722224749/http://www.vancouverhistory.ca/chronology1955.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> Talk of secession began in Langley Prairie in the 1930s, as a result. Headed by a panel of important residents and businesspersons, including Richard Langdon, president of the Langley Board of Trade, the push for independence came to a head in the 1950s.<ref name=":2" /> Specifically, two issues decided Langley's future - street lights, which Langley Prairie argued were not only needed for safety but also progress, but on which [[List of mayors of Langley, British Columbia (district municipality)|reeve]] George Brooks declared "not a nickel" would be spent, and Langley Prairie's belief that it did not have the political sway or its fair share of municipal services that it deserved relative to its local tax contribution.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> Langley Prairie by now made up 20% of the Township's tax base.<ref name=":2" /> A referendum on secession was therefore held in September, 1954. It passed with over 85% of the vote.<ref name=":2" /> Langley Prairie officially seceded and became the [[City of Langley]] on March 15, 1955.<ref name=":0" />

Langley's growth increased during the economic boom after the [[Second World War]]. In 1957, Langley Township, along with other municipalities in British Columbia adopted the grid system for the road network.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Surrey's road naming, numbering, and address location |url=http://www.surreyhistory.ca/addresslocation.html |access-date=2022-08-15 |website=www.surreyhistory.ca |archive-date=2022-08-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220814223344/https://www.surreyhistory.ca/addresslocation.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1967, Langley Township became part of [[Metro Vancouver]]. As with many other parts of Canada and cities in the [[United States]], the Vancouver region expanded with the growth of the [[suburb]]. With the completion of the faster [[British Columbia Highway 1|Trans-Canada Highway]] route in 1964 in the north of Langley, suburb communities such as [[Walnut Grove, Langley|Walnut Grove]] appeared in Langley which were popular with commuters. Most of this growth happened outside of the original communities of Fort Langley and Murrayville, instead happening adjacent to Langley City and near the Trans-Canada highway, likely due to the influence of private automobiles.

=== 21st century ===
[[File:Langley carvolth commercial buildings.jpg|thumb|left|x350px|Modern office buildings in Carvolth area of [[Willoughby, Langley|Willoughby]]]]In February 2006, the Township of Langley moved its Municipal Hall from the "core area" of the Township to the growing [[Willoughby, Langley|Willoughby]] area. The new facility also includes a new library, fitness room (which incorporates a special type of hardwood floor room) and a new community policing station.

Since the 1980s, Langley City and surrounding lands administered by the municipality have been subject to extensive [[strip mall]] development. The old town core remains pleasant to walk through, but many core businesses (including the civil courts and several banks) have moved to the malls, fostering an automobile-dominated community. In addition to this, the community allowed extensive strip development along the Langley [[Bypass (road)|Bypass]], which has become the new sprawled business area of the city.

In the 1990s, the Village of Fort Langley has undergone a revitalization of its core that enhanced its heritage character. In fact, there are no franchises permitted in the village and this has raised its profile as a tourist and independent retail destination with hundreds of thousands of annual visitors. A rowing facility completed in 2009 brings a whole new segment of visitors to the area. In 2016, the landmark Coulter Berry Building was completed, marking the first LEED certified building in Fort Langley.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.keystonearch.ca/architecture/award-winning-coulter-berry-building-fort-langley/|title=The Award-Winning Coulter Berry Building in Fort Langley {{!}} Keystone Architecture|date=2017-02-21|work=Keystone Architecture|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-US|archive-date=2018-08-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817161238/https://www.keystonearch.ca/architecture/award-winning-coulter-berry-building-fort-langley/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Construction of the [[Golden Ears Bridge]] has been completed and opened to traffic on June 16, 2009. The bridge spans the Fraser River and connects the Township of Langley with the communities of Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows. In addition, the plan for the Carvolth Neighbourhood in Willoughby is promoting the construction of new office buildings in proximity to Highway 1 and 200th Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tol.ca/Services-Contact/Document-Library/fid/62 |title=Carvolth Neighbourhood Plan |publisher=www.tol.ca |access-date=13 March 2014 |archive-date=14 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314010755/http://www.tol.ca/Services-Contact/Document-Library/fid/62 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Langley vista d'oro winery.jpg|thumb|right|Vista D'oro winery in South Langley]][[File:Langley Township ALR Map (August 2012).png|thumb|The majority of the land in the Langley Township is designated as part of the [[Agricultural Land Reserve]] (ALR), shown as light blue on this map. This restricts the way the land can be used. The ALR was introduced in 1973 to preserve fertile land and support local farming.]]The Township of Langley is largely a suburban community, but, while the centre is increasingly urban, the periphery (particularly in the south and southeast) maintains its agricultural nature. The neighbourhoods of Willoughby and Walnut Grove are quite suburban and feature large numbers of [[big-box store]]s, the [[Willowbrook Shopping Centre]], and the [[Famous Players]] Colossus Theatre Complex.

===Historic===
[[Fort Langley]] has the distinguished title of being "The Birthplace of British Columbia".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Site Admin |date=July 18, 2016 |title=Birthplace of B.C.

====Other====
In the agricultural areas of Langley, farms produce a variety of fruits and vegetables, meat, dairy and eggs.

== Education ==

=== Schools ===
Langley Township is served by the [[School District 35 Langley]]. It also contains one francophone elementary school, [[École des Voyageurs]], which is part of the province-wide [[Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique|CSF (conseil scolaire francophone), School District 93]], and there is the [[Langley Fine Arts School]] in Fort Langley.

==Transportation==

===Road network===

====Streets and avenues====
[[0 Avenue]] is along the [[Canada–United States border|U.S. border]], and avenue numbers are incremented based on eight per mile (1.6&nbsp;km), so for example 80 Avenue would be {{Convert|10|mi|km}} from the border. Street numbers also increment eight per mile as they go further east. There are roads that break this system such as [[Fraser Highway]], [[Glover Road]] and [[Old Yale Road]], because they existed before the grid system was introduced.
[[File:Topham Road 216th Street.jpg|thumb|x160px|right|Township of Langley Pioneer Marker for Topham Road on 216th St]]
Many of the old road names have been replaced with numeric designations, however Heritage and Pioneer markers installed by the council are placed on many of the roads to highlight their original name.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of Langley |url=http://www.city.langley.bc.ca/index.php/discover-langley/history-of-langley |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313172629/http://www.city.langley.bc.ca/index.php/discover-langley/history-of-langley |archive-date=2013-03-13 |publisher=City of Langley}}</ref>

====Trans-Canada Highway====
{{See also|British Columbia Highway 1|Trans-Canada Highway}}
[[File:Langley, Trans-Canada Highway.jpg|thumb|left|[[Trans-Canada Highway]] in Langley]]
Highway 1, also known as the Trans-Canada Highway, cuts through the northern part of Langley. The [[Walnut Grove, Langley|Walnut Grove]] and [[Willoughby, Langley|Willoughby]] communities are popular with commuters due to being the most developed areas with the easiest access to the highway.

By road, the highway is the fastest method of reaching [[Vancouver]] and all the cities along the route, such as [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], [[Coquitlam]], [[New Westminster]] and [[Burnaby]]. Depending on the traffic volume it can take between 25 and 35 minutes to enter Vancouver city limits.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Port Mann / Highway 1 Improvement Project |url=http://www.pmh1project.com/Pages/default.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121227114426/http://www.pmh1project.com/Pages/default.aspx |archive-date=2012-12-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=PMH1 Project Time Savings - Updated |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgWHPq4du8g |url-access=registration |website=www.youtube.com |access-date=2016-11-27 |archive-date=2016-08-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809114802/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgWHPq4du8g |url-status=live }}</ref> For reaching [[Downtown Vancouver]], drivers can exit at [[Hastings Street (Vancouver)|Hastings Street]] and continue westbound into the downtown core.

In 2012, upgrades to the highway in the Langley and Surrey region have widened the highway by two lanes in each direction - one new HOV lane and one new regular lane - which has reduced traffic congestion. In addition to this there are HOV exits which provide direct access into the communities for Buses, Motorcycles and Cars with more than one occupant.

In addition to the five interchanges, three vehicle overpasses - at 208th Street, Glover Road and 248th Street - cross over the highway. An overpass carries rail traffic exclusively a few hundred metres east of Glover Road.

====Fraser Highway====
{{See also|British Columbia Highway 1A}}
Fraser Highway used to be part of the Trans-Canada Highway but was replaced in 1964. It is a major road that runs from the centre of Surrey, through [[Cloverdale, Surrey|Cloverdale]], the [[City of Langley]], [[Murrayville, Langley|Murrayville]] and continues on to [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]]. While the speed limit between Langley and Abbotsford qualifies as highway speed at 80&nbsp;km/h, between Langley and Surrey the speed limit is primarily 60&nbsp;km/h with the route having frequent traffic lights. This usually means longer travel time than using Highway 1 to reach Surrey City Centre. However, since Fraser Highway goes directly between urban centres, it remains a popular route.

====200 Street====
200 is the longest street that runs through Langley and is a major traffic artery. It starts at 0 Avenue at the U.S. Border (as Carvolth Road), up through [[Brookswood, Langley|Brookswood]], into the City of Langley centre, and continues north through Walnut Grove to the Golden Ears Bridge which leads into [[Pitt Meadows]] and [[Maple Ridge, British Columbia|Maple Ridge]] across the Fraser River.

===United States border===
Langley is situated directly north of and along the [[Canada–United States border|United States border]], with [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] to the south. The northernmost point in Langley is less than 25&nbsp;km from the border. Langley contains [[Lynden–Aldergrove Border Crossing|one of the five Lower Mainland border crossings]] in the community of [[Aldergrove, Langley|Aldergrove]], however [[British Columbia Highway 15]], which only 3.5&nbsp;km to the west of Langley in [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], leads to the larger [[Pacific Highway Border Crossing|Pacific Highway Crossing]]. Crossing the border here is often faster due to having more open crossing lanes including [[NEXUS]] lanes which offer faster crossings for those opted into the NEXUS program.

===Bus services===
{{wide image|Langley carvolth exchange panorama.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|Carvolth Exchange Park and Ride}}
The region is served by [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]] which provides bus services connecting Langley to its neighbouring cities. The largest transit hub in the Township of Langley is [[Carvolth Exchange]] - a bus terminal with a [[park and ride]] situated next to the Trans-Canada Highway on 202nd Street which provides service to various parts of Langley and the Lower Mainland.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Translink - Carvolth Exchange |url=https://infomaps.translink.ca/system_maps/exchange_maps/carvolth.pdf?_gl=1*11ue0wy*_ga*NzE0OTUyNS4xNjY2ODMxMzcy*_ga_2559ZWBT54*MTY2NjgzMTM3MS4xLjEuMTY2NjgzMTQ1NC4zOC4wLjA. |access-date=October 26, 2022 |publisher=[[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]] |archive-date=October 27, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221027005138/https://infomaps.translink.ca/system_maps/exchange_maps/carvolth.pdf?_gl=1*11ue0wy*_ga*NzE0OTUyNS4xNjY2ODMxMzcy*_ga_2559ZWBT54*MTY2NjgzMTM3MS4xLjEuMTY2NjgzMTQ1NC4zOC4wLjA. |url-status=live }}</ref> Notable is the #555 service, an express bus that connects Langley to [[Lougheed Town Centre station]] in Burnaby crossing the [[Port Mann Bridge]]. This route uses the HOV interchanges on the highway, stopping at Surrey (via the 156th Street HOV interchange) and using the Government Street and 202nd Street HOV interchanges to leave and exit the highway.

===Rail services===

====SkyTrain====
The [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] rapid transit system is due to be extended to Langley by 2028.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Surrey Langley SkyTrain project approved, expected to be completed by 2028 |work=[[CBC News]] |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/surrey-langley-skytrain-approved-1.6521120 |access-date=August 3, 2022 |archive-date=August 3, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220803204914/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/surrey-langley-skytrain-approved-1.6521120 |url-status=live }}</ref> Two Skytrain stations are planned for Langley, one at the border between Surrey and the Township of Langley at 196 Street, and another in the City of Langley at 203 Street.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation-projects/surrey-langley-skytrain/surrey-langley-skytrain-project-project-overview|title=Surrey Langley SkyTrain Project - Project Overview - Province of British Columbia|first=Ministry of Transportation and|last=Infrastructure|website=www2.gov.bc.ca|access-date=2022-08-03|archive-date=2022-08-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220803204851/https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation-projects/surrey-langley-skytrain/surrey-langley-skytrain-project-project-overview|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Passenger service====
The community group [https://southfrasercommunityrail.ca/ South Fraser Community Rail] have been campaigning for TransLink to run passenger trains along existing railway tracks through the [[Fraser Valley]] from Surrey, through Langley to [[Chilliwack]]. The tracks were previously used for the [[British Columbia Electric Railway|BCER Interurban]] in the early 20th century but are maintained and in use today for freight rail traffic with passenger rail right-of-way. If implemented, this could potentially include stops at [[Fort Langley]] and [[Milner, British Columbia|Milner]].

====Freight====
The city is served by four railways: [[Canadian National Railway]] (CN), [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CP), [[BNSF Railway|Burlington Northern and Santa Fe]] (BNSF), and the [[Shortline railroad|shortline]] [[Southern Railway of British Columbia]] (SRY).

===Airports===
'''CYNJ''' 
Langley is serviced by [[Langley Regional Airport]], a small controlled airport with no scheduled service. [[Harbour Air]], the largest float-carrier in the world, formerly served Langley with scheduled service but terminated these flights due to low passenger numbers in 2011.
