It serves as the [[administrative centre]] of [[Brovary Raion]]. Brovary hosts the administration of [[Brovary urban hromada]], one of the [[hromada]]s of Ukraine.<ref name="admreform_2020_brovary_city">{{cite web |title=Броварская городская громада |url=https://gromada.info/ru/obschina/brovary/ |publisher=Портал об'єднаних громад України |language=ru}}</ref> In 2024, about 100,000 people live in the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Чисельність населення Бровари на 2024 рік {{!}} Населення Бровари - статистика |url=https://population-hub.com/ua/ua/population-of-brovary-6191.html |access-date=2024-10-30 |website=population-hub.com}}</ref>

==History==
===Early history===
Brovary is a historic town, first mentioned in 1630.<ref name=esu/> At the time there were only 60 or 70 houses in Brovary, but in 1649 a Cossack [[sotnia]] is known to have been formed there. Cossacks took part in the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] under [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]'s leadership.

Originally, the town was called Brovari ({{Langx|uk|Броварі}}), but the name was changed in 1969 to make it [[Russification of Ukraine|more similar to Russian]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2016-11-28 |title=Машина часу. Історія міста Бровари: Швидка комунізація і довга декомунізація |url=https://www.5.ua/suspilstvo/mashyna-chasu-istoriia-mista-brovary-shvydka-komunizatsiia-i-dovha-dekomunizatsiia-132089.html? |website=5 Канал |language=uk}}</ref> The name, translated from Ukrainian, means 'breweries' (and is a loanword from [[Dutch language|Dutch]]). The town got its name after breweries where special beer was made. Travellers who went to [[Kyiv]] often stopped in Brovary, rested, dined and drank the local beer. Many famous people visited Brovary while travelling to Kyiv. A Ukrainian poet, [[Taras Shevchenko]], was among them. He visited this town many times in the period from 1829 to 1847. Nowadays there is a monument to Shevchenko in the place from which Brovary began its history as a town, in its old centre.

In 1923, Brovary became the center of [[Brovary Raion]]. In that year, Brovary had a population of 4,065 people. In 1930, the district was reworked, with its center moved to [[Velyka Dymerka]]. In 1937, this change was undone, and the center was moved back to Brovary.<ref name=ssr>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Бровари, Броварський район, Київська область |encyclopedia=[[Історія міст і сіл Української РСР]] |url=https://ukrssr.com.ua/kiyivska/brovarskiy/brovari-brovarskiy-rayon-kiyivska-oblast |language=uk}}</ref>

Brovary received city status in 1956, and in 1972 was designated a [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]] - meaning that while Brovary still served as the administrative center of Brovary Raion, it was no longer subordinated to it, instead being directly subordinated to the government of [[Kyiv Oblast]].<ref name=esu>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Бровари |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Modern Ukraine]] |publisher=Інститут енциклопедичних досліджень НАН України |url=https://esu.com.ua/article-37829 |last=Колесник |first=В. О. |date=2004-02-01 |volume=3 |language=Ukrainian |isbn=978-966-02-2074-4}}</ref>

===Early 21st century===

International ill-fame came to Brovary in April 2000 after an apartment block was {{ill|1=2000 Brovary missile attack|lt=hit by a stray surface-to-surface missile|2=uk|3=Броварська катастрофа (2000)|4=ru|5=Попадание ракеты в жилой дом в Броварах}} launched from a neighbouring army shooting range in Honcharivske during a training exercise.

During the country-wide Ukrainian administrative reform of 17 July 2020, Brovary's status as a city of oblast significance was abolished, and it was returned to subordination to Brovary Raion.

===Russian invasion of Ukraine===

{{Anchor|war}}It was reported on 10 March 2022 that there had been an attack on a Russian armoured column at Skybyn, just outside Brovary, as it was trying to move in from the north.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--not stated--> |date=10 March 2022 |title=Ukraine war: 'Lots and lots of losses': Military vehicles destroyed in Brovary, north-east of Kyiv |url=https://news.sky.com/video/ukraine-war-lots-and-lots-of-losses-military-vehicles-destroyed-in-brovary-north-east-of-kyiv-12562350 |work=Sky News |location=|access-date=10 March 2022}}</ref><ref>[https://fr.euronews.com/2022/03/10/ukraine-avancee-des-troupes-russes-vers-kyiv-et-catastrophe-humanitaire euronews]</ref> On 11 March there were fights in Brovary as Russian troops were trying to encircle Kyiv from its east.<ref name="frencharmy11March">https://www.defense.gouv.fr/var/dicod/storage/images/base-de-medias/images/actualites/images-actu/ukraine-point-de-situation-au-11-mars-2022/10526007-5-fre-FR/ukraine-point-de-situation-au-11-mars-2022.jpg {{Bare URL image|date=March 2022}} {{Dead link|date=September 2024}}</ref>

On 2 April 2022 the whole of [[Kyiv Oblast]], where Brovary is located, was declared liberated by the [[Ukrainian Ministry of Defense]] after Russian troops had left the area.<ref>[https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/3/ukraine-retakes-whole-kyiv-region-as-russian-troops-pull-back Ukraine ‘retakes whole Kyiv region’ as Russia looks east], [[aljazeera.com]] (3 April 2022)</ref>

In August 2023, [[Ukrainian Institute of National Memory]] decided that the name of the city did not meet the spelling norms and standards of the state language (Ukrainian), meaning that Brovary will be renamed.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bohdaniok |first=Olena |date=2023-08-03 |title= |script-title=uk:Деколонізація: УІНП підготував перелік населених пунктів, які варто перейменувати |trans-title=Decolonization: UINM prepared the list of populated places that need to be renamed |url=https://suspilne.media/543519-dekolonizacia-uinp-pidgotuvav-perelik-naselenih-punktiv-aki-varto-perejmenuvati/ |website=[[Suspilne]]}}</ref> On 20 March 2024, the Committee of the [[Verkhovna Rada]] on issues of organization of state power, local self-government, regional development and urban planning decided to propose the old name, ''Brovari'', which corresponds to Ukrainian language standards.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Braslavskyi |first=Dmytro |date=2024-03-20 |title= |script-title=uk:Червоноград, Павлоград і Бровари перейменують.
