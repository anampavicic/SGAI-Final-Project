The total area of the city is {{convert|331.50|sqkm|sqmi}}. Because the city escaped war damage during World War II, many historical temples, traditional shops and ''[[Kura (storehouse)|kura]]'' (Japanese traditional storehouses) remain in the city center. The city was awarded the [http://www.kuranomachi.jp/news/news/2009/05/21.php "Utsukushii-machinami Taisho"] prize from the [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism]] in 2009.<ref>[http://www.mlit.go.jp/crd/townscape/pdf/H21_jushouchiku_gaiyou.pdf] Japanese Ministry of Land, Transportation and Infrastructure {{in lang|ja}}</ref>

The city is located in the northern part of the [[Kanto plain]], with a mountain range extending in the northern part of the city. The Tomawa River runs through the city center, the Oshigawa River runs through the eastern part, and the [[Watarase River]] runs through the southern part. At the confluence of these three rivers is the Yanaka Reservoir, which is used for sailboating and windsurfing. It was designated a [[Ramsar Site]] in June 2012.<ref>[http://biodiversity-l.iisd.org/news/japan-designates-nine-new-ramsar-sites/ June, 2012].</ref>

==History==
In the [[Edo period]], Tochigi prospered from its location on the Uzumagawa River, which connected with the [[Tone River]] to [[Edo]]. Envoys using the ''Reiheishi Way'' sent from the Imperial Court going to [[Shrines and Temples of Nikkō]] stayed at the lodging area in the city. Most of the area was formerly ''[[tenryō]]'' territory controlled directly by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]; however, the minor [[han system|feudal domain]] of [[Fukiake Domain]] was located within the borders of modern city of Tochigi.

Following the [[Meiji Restoration]] and the creation of Tochigi Prefecture, Tochigi Town was the prefectural capital from 1871 until its relocation to [[Utsunomiya]] in 1884. On April 1, 1937, Tochigi was elevated to city status.

On September 30, 1954, Tochigi absorbed the villages of Ōmiya, Minagawa, Fukiage and Terao (all from [[Shimotsuga District, Tochigi|Shimotsuga District]]). This was followed by the village of Kōō (from Shimotsuga District) on March 31, 1957.
Tochigi hosted its first film festival, the ''Kuranomachikado'', or, "Eizo Film Festival" from October 5, 2007, to October 8, 2007.

On March 29, 2010, Tochigi absorbed the towns of [[Fujioka, Tochigi|Fujioka]], [[Ōhira, Tochigi|Ōhira]] and [[Tsuga, Tochigi|Tsuga]] (Shimotsuga District). This was followed by the town of [[Nishikata, Tochigi|Nishikata]] (from [[Kamitsuga District, Tochigi|Kamitsuga District]]) on October 1, 2011, and the town of [[Iwafune, Tochigi|Iwafune]] (from Shimotsuga District) on April 5, 2014.

==Government==
Tochigi has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city legislature of 30 members. Tochigi contributes four members to the Tochigi Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between the [[Tochigi 2nd district]], [[Tochigi 4th district]] and [[Tochigi 5th district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Tochigi city is a regional commercial center, and has a mixed local economy. Food processing, automotive parts and light manufacturing dominated the industrial sector. [[Isuzu]] has maintained a factory since 1961.  In 2010, the city ranked first in the number of farming families in the prefecture.<ref>[http://www.city.tochigi.lg.jp/hp/menu000009000/hpg000008302.htm Tochigi city official home page] {{in lang|ja}}</ref>
