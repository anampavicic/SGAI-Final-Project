'''Malaybalay''', officially the '''City of Malaybalay''' ([[Bukid language|Binukid]]: ''Bánuwa ta Malaybaláy''), is a 1st class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] and capital of the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Bukidnon]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 190,712 people.{{PH census|current}}

The city, dubbed as the "South Summer Capital of the Philippines", is bordered north by [[Impasugong]]; west by [[Lantapan, Bukidnon|Lantapan]]; south by [[Valencia, Bukidnon|Valencia]] and [[San Fernando, Bukidnon|San Fernando]]; and east by [[Cabanglasan, Bukidnon|Cabanglasan]] and [[Agusan del Sur]].

It was formerly part of the province of [[Misamis Oriental]] as a municipal district in the late 19th century. When the special province of Agusan (now [[Agusan del Norte]] and [[Agusan del Sur]]) and its sub-province (Bukidnon) were created in 1907, Malaybalay was designated as the capital of Bukidnon. It was then formally established as a municipality on October 19, 1907, and was created into a city on February 11, 1998, by virtue of ''Republic Act 8490''.

Malaybalay City is the venue of the [[Kaamulan]] Festival, held annually from mid-February to March 10.<ref name="events">[https://archive.today/20071024212151/http://elgu.ncc.gov.ph/ecommunity/malaybalay/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=39 Cultural and Historical Sites & Events]</ref>

== History ==
Historiographic accounts for Malaybalay are scarce, and conflicting narratives further obscure the actual history of the city due to the oral nature of passing information by the Indigenous peoples and the incomplete accounts of Spanish registries in the region.

=== Precolonial history ===
Malaybalay is one of the few villages in central Mindanao that was founded by the natives. People who live in present-day Malaybalay and most of Northern Mindanao and parts of [[Caraga]] now call themselves Higaonon. [[Higaonon people|Higaonon]] tribal chieftains claim a city was built at the confluence (''sabangán'') of the Kibalabag and Can-ayan Rivers, at which point the [[Tagoloan River]] begins and is considered a sacred place by the tribe. They never converted to Islam like the tribes in Cotabato and Lanao.

=== Spanish period, 17th to 19th century ===
[[File:Misamis 1899.JPG|left|thumb|256x256px|Map of Misamis Province, 1899]]
The Spanish, who arrived in the area in the 18th century, already saw thriving communities along the Tagoloan River. In 1815, the Province of [[Misamis (province)|Misamis]] was created, which included areas of present-day Bukidnon. However, some skirmishes with the Spanish administration existed, such as the burning of [[Kalasungay]] village in 1850 by Spanish authorities, although the cause of such incident is conflicting. Nonetheless it dispersed the survivors into neighboring villages such as Silae and Silipon (now [[Dalwangan]]). A group established a new settlement near the Sacub River (a spring near present-day Rizal Park), led by Datù Mampaalong. In June 15, 1877, in an accord between the Spanish government and Mampaalong with 30 other datù, their settlement called Malaybalay was incorporated into Misamis. At the same event, Mampaalong and his people embraced [[Christianity]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Historical Background {{!}} THE CITY GOVERNMENT OF MALAYBALAY |url=https://malaybalaycity.gov.ph/about-malaybalay/historical-background/ |access-date=January 5, 2023 |language=en}}</ref> Spanish registries incorporated Malaybalay as the ''pueblo'' Oroquieta, in the town of '''Sevilla''' (now [[Mailag]]), administered by the clergy. Other settlements, namely Kalasungay (''Calasungay''), [[Linabo]], [[Silae]], [[Valencia, Bukidnon|Valencia]], Bugcaon, Alanib (''Covadonga''), Monserrat (may refer to either Lumbayao or Lurugan), and Lepanto (may refer to [[Maramag]]) were also incorporated into the town in separate occasions. Although Mailag was the designated town proper by the Spanish government, it was Linabo that served as the seat of town government.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/AFJ2108.0001.001 |title=El archipiélago filipino : colección de datos geográficos, estadísticos, cronológicos y científicos, relativos al mismo, entresacados de anteriores obras ú obtenidos con la propia observación y estudio / por algunos padres de la Misión de la Compañía de Jesús en estas islas ; [José Algué, editor]. [Vol. 1, no. 1] |date=2005}}</ref> Malaybalay was then a barrio headed by an appointed [[cabeza de barangay]].[[File:Street in Malaybalay, Bukidnon (c.1917).jpg|thumb|left|A street in Malaybalay in 1917]]

=== American occupation, 1898-1946 ===
During the American occupation, administrative structure of Mindanao underwent complete overhaul. The Province of Misamis was dissolved forming the current provinces of Misamis Occidental and Misamis Oriental. Likewise, the Philippine Commission then headed by Commissioner [[Dean Conant Worcester|Dean C. Worcester]], Secretary of Interior and a member of the [[Philippine Commission]] proposed the creation of a province of Bukidnon. With it, the local administration of Sevilla was considered defunct.
[[File:Philippine Island - Mindanao - NARA - 68156204.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Malaybalay, 1935]]

On August 20, 1907, the Philippine Commission Act No. 1693 was enacted creating the sub-province of Bukidnon. Malaybalay was then formally created as a municipality on October 19, 1907, replacing Mailag. It included the barrios of the former Sevilla except for Maramag, which became a separate Municipality. Dalwangan, formerly a village under [[Sumilao]] during the Spanish administration, was also incorporated within Malaybalay.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Administrative Code for the Department of Mindanao and Sulu |publisher=THE MINDANAO HERALD PUB. CO. |year=1918 |location=Zamboanga |language=English}}</ref> When Bukidnon was declared as a regular province and become an independent political unit on March 10, 1917, by virtue of the creation of the [[Department of Mindanao and Sulu]] under Act 2711, Malaybalay was designated as its provincial capital.

=== World War II and Japanese occupation, 1942-1945 ===
[[File:American prisoners of war celebrate the 4th of July in the Japanese prison camp of Casisange in Malaybalay, on... - NARA - 531352.tif|left|thumb|American prisoners of war celebrate the 4th of July in the Japanese prison camp of Casisang in Malaybalay.]]

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], in 1942, the Japanese occupation troops entered Bukidnon. They occupied Malaybalay, establishing a camp in Casisang. [[Guerrilla]] groups operating around Malaybalay made frequent raids on the Japanese camps from the time of the occupation until the arrival of the Americans. In 1945 American liberation forces, together with the [[Philippine Commonwealth]] Forces and Filipino guerrillas, liberated Malaybalay.

=== Postwar Malaybalay ===
Malaybalay was one of the few municipalities and municipal districts comprising Bukidnon and in the decades that followed, several municipalities were created from Malaybalay's far-flung but populous barangays. These municipalities eventually became [[San Fernando, Bukidnon|San Fernando]] (1959, from 8 barrios), [[Valencia, Bukidnon|Valencia]] (1961, from 13 barrios), [[Lantapan]] (1968, from 12 barrios), and [[Cabanglasan]] (1979, from 15 barrios). As the capital town, most economic activity was centered here until it shifted to the more centrally located Valencia, its daughter town. In 1980, Valencia overtook Malaybalay as the most populous municipality.

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
On March 26, 1996, the [[Sangguniang Bayan]] of the municipality of Malaybalay passed Resolution No. 3699-96 petitioning to the House of Representatives for the conversion of Malaybalay into a city. Reginaldo Tilanduca, 2nd District Representative of Bukidnon at that time, filed House Bill No. 6275, proposing the creation of Malaybalay into a component city. On March 22, 1998, President [[Fidel Ramos]] signed the act (R.A. 8490) that converted Malaybalay to a city, making it the first component city of Bukidnon.

== Geography ==
Malaybalay, the capital city of [[Bukidnon]], is in the central part of the province. It is bounded in the east by the municipality of [[Cabanglasan, Bukidnon|Cabanglasan]] and the Pantaron Range, which separates Bukidnon from the provinces of Agusan del Sur and [[Davao del Norte]]; on the west by the municipality of [[Lantapan, Bukidnon|Lantapan]] and [[Mount Kitanglad]]; on the north by the municipality of [[Impasugong]]; and on the south by [[Valencia, Bukidnon|Valencia City]] and the municipality of [[San Fernando, Bukidnon|San Fernando]].<ref name="popcom">{{Cite web |url=http://www.popcom.gov.ph/regions/10/Malaybalay%20%20Profile.htm |title=Commission on Population – Malaybalay City Profile |access-date=April 30, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828205446/http://www.popcom.gov.ph/regions/10/Malaybalay%20%20Profile.htm#Physical |archive-date=August 28, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The whole eastern and southeastern border adjoining Agusan del Sur and [[Davao del Norte]] is elevated and densely forested mountains, which is one of the few remaining forest blocks of [[Mindanao]]. The nearest seaports and airports are in [[Cagayan de Oro]], which is 91 kilometers away.

=== Barangays ===
{{Main|Barangays of Malaybalay}}
Malaybalay is politically subdivided into 46 [[barangay]]s. Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s while some have [[sitios]].

These barangays are conveniently grouped into 5 geographical districts, namely the [[Poblacion, Malaybalay|Poblacion District]], [[Barangays of Malaybalay#North Highway District|North Highway District]], [[Barangays of Malaybalay#South Highway District|South Highway District]], [[Barangays of Malaybalay#Basakan District|Basakan District]], and [[Barangays of Malaybalay#Upper Pulangi District|Upper Pulangi District]].

=== Land area ===

The total land area of the city is {{Convert|96919|ha}}, that is about 13% of the total area of Bukidnon. An estimated of 65% of this is classified as forestland/timberland and the remaining 35% is alienable and disposable areas: lands which could be used for purposes such as for agriculture or for industry.<ref name="popcom" />

The city plays a strategic role in the protection of the headwater source of the [[Pulangi River|Pulangi]] and the [[Tagoloan River|Tagoloan]] rivers because of its location the upper portion of both watershed areas. The Pulangi River then extends through the [[Cotabato]] provinces as the [[Mindanao River|Rio Grande de Mindanao]] and to [[Cotabato City]], where it empties into Illana Bay. The Tagoloan River, on the other hand, traverses northwestward toward [[Tagoloan, Misamis Oriental]], where it joins [[Macajalar Bay]]. These [[drainage basin|watershed]] areas provided [[potable water]], [[irrigation]], [[hydro-electric]] power, and recreation and [[tourism]] activities.

The average elevation of the city is {{convert|622|m}} above sea level. About 60% of the city's area has above 30% slope, characterized by steep hills, mountains, and cliff-like stream side. About 25% are level, gently sloping, and undulating. The rest are rolling and hilly.<ref name="profile">{{cite book |title=Malaybalay Socio-Economic Profile (2007) |publisher=City Government of Malaybalay |location=Malaybalay}}</ref><ref name="popcom" />

One of prominent geographical structure in the city is the Kitanglad Mountain Range, located in the western frontier, on its border with [[Lantapan, Bukidnon|Lantapan]] and Impasugong. Some [[barangay]]s ([[Dalwangan]], Capitan Bayong, Imbayao and Mampayag) are in the foothills of this mountain range. Steep hills are found in the central portion of the city (Kibalabag, [[Manalog]] and [[Can-ayan]]), where the Tagoloan River [[headwater]] can be found. The Central Mindanao Cordillera (Pantaron Mountain Range), is on the eastern side of the city, in its boundaries with Agusan del Sur province. The Pulangi River cuts across the area between the hills in the central part and the Central Cordillera in the eastern part, creating a portion of the Upper Pulangi river valley. The southern portion of the city is made up of level to undulating area, a river valley created by the [[Sawaga River]] and the [[Manupali River|Manupali]] River, which are both tributaries of the Pulangi River.

About 66% of the city's soil is identified as undifferentiated mountain soil and the rest are [[clay]]. The predominant types of clay are Kidapawan, Alimodian and Adtuyon, which are generally good for agriculture.

[[File:Ph bukidnon malaybalay city historical pop growth1918-2007.PNG|thumb|right|Historical growth of population of Malaybalay, 1918–2007]]
Malaybalay is originally the home of the Bukidnon ''"[[lumad]]s"'' or natives, but there has been an influx of settlers and immigrants from the Visayas and Luzon for the last four decades contributing to the growth of the population. The original inhabitants, the Bukidnons, have retreated to the hinterlands as the migrants continued to occupy and dominate the population centers in the city. Malaybalay is the second most populous political subdivision in the province, after Valencia.

The historical growth of population of the city showed a variable pattern of growth (See Figure). The first census of population was made in 1918 with Malaybalay having only 16,428 inhabitants. The 21 years from 1918 to 1939 was a low-growth period with the city's population growing at a 0.6% annually. This was then followed by a period of population decline until the post-[[World War II]] era, declining by 1.5% per year. The 12-year period from 1948 to 1960 is a period of high growth, when the city's population almost doubled from its 1948 level. This pace of growth continued until 1970, growing 6.7%. In 1970, Malaybalay has 65,918 inhabitants. A 5-year period of declining growth followed, the population dropped to 60,779. After the decline, Malaybalay's population has been increasing since then, growing by 3.4% from 1990 to 1995 and by 1.9% from 1995 to 2000.

The city is predominantly rural, with only 16% of the population in urban areas, 40% in urbanizing barangays and 46% in rural areas. Population is evenly distributed in the urban and rural areas. The urban areas are generally found on the confines of the [[Sayre Highway]] (also known in the city as "Fortich Street") that traverses the city. The main urban population is found in the Poblacion-Casisang-Sumpong area. Secondary population centers includes barangays [[Aglayan]], [[Bangcud]], [[Kalasungay]] and [[San Jose, Malaybalay|San Jose]].

Malaybalay has one of the lowest average population density in the province, second only to Impasug-ong with only 146 persons per square kilometer although there are barangays, especially in the Poblacion area, with high population density.

[[Cebuano language#Mindanao|Cebuano]] and [[Binukid language|Binukid]] are prevailing mediums of communication in the city. More than half of the city's population are speakers of these languages. Other languages such as [[Maranao language|Maranao]] are spoken by the [[Maranao people|Maranaos]]. [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] is also spoken by the descendants of the [[Hiligaynons|Hiligaynon]]/Ilonggo settlers in the city.

[[File:Gaisano Malaybalay City Buk.jpg|thumb|right|Gaisano Malaybalay]]
The city is mainly an agricultural area, and its products include rice, corn, sugarcane, vegetables, legumes, root crops and commercial crops such as rubber, coffee, banana and pineapple. During the past years, corn used to be the pre-dominant crop in the city. But as the corn areas gave way to sugarcane, agri-farms (poultry, hog), and residential areas, sugarcane (306,600 metric tons) and rice (30,318 MT) came out now as the predominant crops in terms of production volume. These products are usually sold in the local market, or in nearby municipalities of the province. There are also farmers producing larger volume of corn and rice who sell their products in Cagayan de Oro.
Agri-based industries primarily poultry and piggery, now flourish in the city. These farms are assisted by big corporations such as [[San Miguel Corporation|San Miguel]], Purefoods, Monterey and Swift. Other agri-based industries in the City include Asian Hybrid Philippines (feeds processing), Rubber Tex (rubber shoes manufacturing), and Monastery Farms (peanuts and other preserved foods). Also notable are the 12 cattle ranches that produce an average of 470 heads yearly.

Data from the License Department of the City showed that a majority or 95.87% of the establishments in the City belong to the service sector. Looking at the breakdown, sari-sari stores (37%) make up majority of the establishments in this sector, followed by trade/wholesale/retails (21%) and other, social and personal services (14%). Industry Sector and Agriculture Sector only make up only 2.27% and 1.9% respectively of all establishments.
There is no data available on the employment per sector from the NSO that is specific for Malaybalay, thus the CPDO collected data from DTI, License Department, and City Agriculture Office to get the distribution of employment per industrial sector. The result showed that 70% of employment is in the farming/ crop production sector followed by government agencies and commercial/private establishments. Agri-industries and service sectors registered only about 1.63% and 5.99% respectively. The lowest is the manufacturing/processing sector at only 0.36%.
So far 3 spring resorts, 5 plazas/nature parks have been developed in the city.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Other natural sites such as forest, industrial tree plantation sites, mountains, falls, rivers and caves are still to be developed for eco-tourism.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://malaybalaycity.gov.ph/malaybalay/?page_id=39 |title=Official Website of City Government of Malaybalay |access-date=December 29, 2015 |archive-date=January 26, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126055742/http://malaybalaycity.gov.ph/malaybalay/?page_id=39 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== City administration ===
The city is administered by the [[mayor|City Mayor]] together with the [[Vice Mayor]] and the [[Sangguniang Panlungsod]].<ref name="politics">[http://www.philcom.ph/gov/malaybalay/gov.html Malaybalay City Government] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502132600/http://www.philcom.ph/gov/malaybalay/gov.html |date=May 2, 2008 }}</ref> The mayor is the local chief executive officer of the city and exercises control and supervision over all local administrative offices as mandated by the [[Local government code of the Philippines]] (1991). The city also has a [[City Administrator]] that assists the mayor.

The [[Sangguniang Panlungsod]] (or SP) serves as the local legislative arm of the city. It enacts [[Local ordinance|ordinances]] and issues regulations that are necessary to promote the propriety and general welfare of the city's residents; ensure the health, safety, comfort and convenience of its constituents, maintain peace and order, improve and promote high public morals, and ensure the protection of the properties within the city's jurisdiction. There are 12 elected Sangguniang members and a permanent Sangguniang Panlungsod secretary. The Sangguniang Panlungsod is headed by the Vice Mayor, acting as its presiding officer.

[[File:MalaybalayDowntown.jpg|thumb|260px|View of Sayre Highway and the downtown Malaybalay]]
;''Roads and highways''

There are about 820.89 kilometers of road linking the different parts of the city. 102.70&nbsp;km or 12.51% are classified as National Road, 60.40&nbsp;km or 7.36% Provincial Road, 61.35&nbsp;km or 7.47% City Road, and 596.44&nbsp;km or 72.66% barangay roads. About 14.14% of all roads in the city are paved, that is, either concrete or asphalt. These are in the poblacion areas. At least 85.86% are unpaved (gravel or earth filled). These are primarily the barangay roads. These unpaved roads leading to the rural barangays usually require regular maintenance since they are easily destroyed by heavy rains. There are also logging roads leading to the forestal communities, but these are usually passable by farm animals and single motor cycles only, making it hard for communities to transport products into the market.

Connecting the various road networks and cutting across rivers and creeks are at least 22 bridges of various types. Almost all of these bridges are said to be in good condition. There are 15 bridges or 69.35% totaling to about 470.67 m in length that are administered nationally, while 3 bridges of about 115.00 m are under the province's administration. Only about 93.00 m or about 13.70% are under the administration of city and barangays.

The [[Sayre Highway]] bisects the Poblacion, the main urban center of the city, serving as the main thoroughfare of the city.<ref>When the Sayre Highway reaches the Poblacion of Malaybalay City, it is known as Fortich Street, named after the first governor of the province of Bukidnon</ref> Buses that ply the [[Cagayan de Oro]], [[General Santos]], [[Butuan]] and [[Davao City]] route, as well as [[jeepney]]s, multi-cabs, vans and private vehicles pass through this highway. Suburbs are served by multicabs, ''motorelas'' and improvised bicycles (''trisikads'').<ref name="transpo">[http://www.philcom.ph/gov/malaybalay/history.html Malaybalay City Transportation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503032005/http://www.philcom.ph/gov/malaybalay/history.html |date=May 3, 2008 }}</ref>

The current main highway in the city center is now congested. Heavy traffic and congestion has been observed in the main highway, especially during peak hours. The absence of proper and adequate parking areas further contributes to the congestion. The situation underlies the need for a bypass road as well as more traffic aides. The city has two proposed roads to answer the above concerns. The first proposal is the Circumferential Road from Sumpong to DPWH Depot in Casisang, which is 2.5&nbsp;km. in length. The other is the by-pass road from Dalwangan to San Jose with a total stretch of 15&nbsp;km.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite web |url=http://malaybalaycity.gov.ph/malaybalay/?page_id=47 |title=Official Website of City Government of Malaybalay |access-date=December 29, 2015 |archive-date=January 26, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126055728/http://malaybalaycity.gov.ph/malaybalay/?page_id=47 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Butuan-Malaybalay Road becomes the secondary road connecting [[Esperanza, Agusan del Sur]], which is scheduled to complete in the future.

;''Public transportation''
There are various types of public transportation. Buses that ply the Bukidnon, [[Cagayan de Oro]], [[General Santos]], [[Butuan]] and [[Davao City]] route are used for travel from the city to other provinces. There are also mini-vans that transport passengers from Cagayan de Oro to Malaybalay. The multi-cabs ply the main highway from the poblacion proper to other points of destination within the city and nearby barangays. The four-wheeled motorelas are limited to the inner streets. Recently, tri-sikads have also begun to operate in the inner streets of Barangay Sumpong. Jeepneys are usually used for travel from the poblacion to other barangays and municipalities. In far-flung areas, motorcycles (habal-habal) are the fastest means of transportation.

The main terminal for public transportation vehicles is in the public market, especially for buses, mini-vans, and jeepneys. For motorelas and tri-sikads, street-corners of convergence serve as terminals or waiting areas.

With the increase in traffic of both vehicles and pedestrians, especially in the poblacion, there is a growing concern for better and safer organized streets. There is a need to designate walking pavements or pedestrian lanes, including pedestrian overpass especially for the use of children and students crossing the major highway.<ref name="ReferenceA" />

;''Airports and seaports''
Malaybalay once had an airport located at Barangay Casisang but closed in the 1990s by the provincial government to give land for housing; the nearest one is the [[Laguindingan Airport]] in Cagayan de Oro. The city also relies on the Cagayan de Oro seaport for the delivery of its products to other destinations in the Philippines as it is the closest port to the city.

;''Housing Development''
To close the housing gap of 6.5 million between 2017 and 2020, the government needs to build 250,000 houses a year. Currently, however, the housing sector can only build 203,000 to 205,000 units annually between 2016 and 2019.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ordinario |first1=Cai |title=Citing 22-million backlog forecast, government steps up housing projects |url=https://businessmirror.com.ph/2020/06/12/citing-22-million-backlog-forecast-government-steps-up-housing-projects/ |website=businessmirror.com.ph |date=June 12, 2020 |publisher=Business Mirror |access-date=March 5, 2021}}</ref>

Housing developments in Malaybalay includes Salang Homes Subdivision, Lumina Homes, Greenfields Subdivision, Dumalahay Subdivision, and Legacie Country Homes.

=== Utilities ===

;''Electricity''
All the 46 barangays are already energized. Majority or 57.07% of the city's households have electricity for lighting. 39.88% of households still use kerosene.

Malaybalay is served by the ''Bukidnon Second Electric Cooperative Incorporated'' or '''BUSECO''',<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://buseco.coop/ |title=BUSECO – Bukidnon Second Electric Cooperative, Inc. |language=en-US |access-date=October 14, 2019}}</ref> which started its operations in 1979 (Table 77: Number of Connections by Type of Users and Average Consumption). Recent data from BUSECO indicate a total of 16,157 power connections. Of these 14,107 or 87.31% are residential connections, while 1,454 or 9.00% are commercial establishments.

While the number of household connections is 9 times more than the combined industrial and commercial connections, the average monthly consumption of households is 3.06% less than the latter. In actual number, businesses use at least 73,560.39 kWh per month more than households. This trend is not surprising because businesses tend to use more electricity than households.

However, the data underlines the need to plan ahead to ensure that there is enough power supply for the city's growing power demands. Already, at least 43% of the population remains without electricity and those who do have experience regular power outage. This sector needs attention especially with the expected increase in population as well as business establishments.<ref name="ReferenceA" />

;''Water''

The water system and services of Malaybalay is provided by ''Malaybalay City Water District'' ('''MCWD''')<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.emcwd.gov.ph/ |title=MCWD – Water is Life, Save It – The Official Website of the Malaybalay City Water District |language=en-US |access-date=October 14, 2019}}</ref> in which its office is located in Barangay Sumpong.

;''Telecommunications, Media and Courier Services''
There are 2 major telephone companies in the city, the Southern Telecommunications Company (SOTELCO) and Philcom. Both Philcom and Sotelco offer Internet connections. Mobile phone services available in the city include Globe, Smart, TM and Sun. With the growing demand for better communication systems companies are facing the challenge of providing better and higher quality services to the population.

Broadcast media include 5 radio and 2 television repeater stations, including a cable station. Most national dailies such as the Philippine Daily Inquirer and Philippine Star are available. Local newspapers include the Bukidnon Newswatch, Gold Star Daily and Bukidnon Plateau.

There are 4 major courier services available in the city for national and international forwarding. The post office, the Bureau of Telecommunication and 2 telegraphic companies serve other communication needs.

The telecommunication technologies have continued to improve over the years. But the mode of communication in the upland barangays are still the old and tested letter sending through vehicle drivers and broadcasting over the public radio stations.<ref name="ReferenceA" />

The city's mobile and internet services are provided by [[Globe Telecom]], [[PLDT]], Parasat Cable TV and [[Smart Communications]].

=== Law enforcement ===
The Malaybalay Police Station is responsible for the protection of the city's population against crime. Data for year 2005 indicate that the police force is 76 and serving a population of 136,210. This translates to a ratio of 1 policeman for every 1,792 persons in the city. Ideal ratio for police to population is 1:500 and the minimum standard police-population ratio is 1:1,000. In terms of area coverage, this translates to 1 policeman for every 1,424 hectares.

There are 9 police community precincts located in Sumpong, Dalwangan, Casisang, Aglayan, Managok, Bangcud, Zamboangita, Can-ayan and Barangay 9 (Public Market). The police force to population ratio is highest in Casisang with 1 policeman for every 13,874 individuals. Lowest ratio is in Sumpong with 1:151. A low ratio indicates that there are more policemen available to serve the population of a given area.

Further analysis indicates that based on the total population, the number of existing police force and the minimum police-population ratio of 1:1,000, the city still needs 606 policemen.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{Cite web |url=http://malaybalaycity.gov.ph/malaybalay/?page_id=166 |title=Official Website of City Government of Malaybalay |access-date=December 29, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126061033/http://malaybalaycity.gov.ph/malaybalay/?page_id=166 |archive-date=January 26, 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The other one is Camp Osito Bahian, located at Impalambong, Barangay 10. It is the home of the [[403rd Infantry Brigade]]

Barangay Public Safety Officer (BPSO) also assists in the peace-keeping efforts at the barangay level.
