==Etymology==
The name "Dundee" is made up of two parts: the common [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] place-name element ''dun'', meaning fort; and a second part that may derive from a Celtic element, cognate with the Gaelic ''dè'', meaning 'fire'.<ref>{{harvnb|Watson|1926|p=220}}; Dundee is also recorded as ''Dun-Tay'', e.g. {{harvnb|Pont|1583–1596 }}</ref>

The town became a [[Royal Burgh]] on John's coronation as king in 1292.<ref name="Barrow 1990 24">{{harvnb|Barrow|1990|p=24 }}</ref> The town and its castle were occupied by English forces for several years during the [[First War of Scottish Independence|First War of Independence]] and recaptured by [[Robert the Bruce]] in early 1312.<ref>{{harvnb|Barrow|1965|pp=272, 374 }}</ref> The original burghal charters were lost during the occupation and subsequently renewed by Bruce in 1327.<ref>{{harvnb|Mackie|1836|pp=30–32, 207–208 }}</ref>

[[File:Dundee1693 JohnSlezer2.jpg|thumb|left|Dundee in 1693 by [[John Slezer]]]]

The burgh suffered considerably during the conflict known as the [[Rough Wooing]] of 1543 to 1550, and was occupied by the English forces of [[Andrew Dudley]] from 1547. In 1548, unable to defend the town against an advancing Scottish force, Dudley ordered that the town be burnt to the ground.<ref>{{harvnb|McKean|2009|pp=9–10}}; {{harvnb|Merriman|2000|pp=263, 292, 304, 360–361 }}</ref> In 1645, during the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], Dundee was again besieged, this time by the Royalist [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Marquess of Montrose]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lythe|1958|pp=27–28}}; {{harvnb|Reid|1990|pp=97–99}}; {{harvnb|Cowan|1995|pp=195–198}}; {{harvnb|Cullen|Whatley|Young|2009|pp=61–63 }}</ref> The town was finally destroyed by Parliamentarian forces led by [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|George Monck]] in 1651.<ref>{{harvnb|Mackie|1836|pp=32–38}}; {{harvnb|Lythe|1958|pp=28–30}}; {{harvnb|Cullen|Whatley|Young|2009|pp=63–64 }}</ref> The town played a pivotal role in the establishment of the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] cause when [[John Graham of Claverhouse, 1st Viscount Dundee]] raised the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] standard on the [[Law, Dundee|Dundee Law]] in 1689.<ref>{{harvnb|Lenman|1980|p=30}}; {{harvnb|Patrick|2009|pp=85–88 }}</ref> The town was held by the Jacobites in the 1715–16 rising, and on 6 January 1716 the Jacobite claimant to the throne, [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James VIII and III]] (the Old Pretender), made a public entry into the town. Many in Scotland, including many in Dundee, regarded him as the rightful king.<ref>J. Baynes, ''The Jacobite Rising of 1715'' (1970), p. 166</ref>

A notable resident of Dundee was Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan of Camperdown, [[Barony of Lundie|Baron of Lundie]] (1 July 1731 to 4 August 1804). He was born in Dundee on 1 July 1731, the son of Alexander Duncan of Lundie, Provost of Dundee. Adam was educated in Dundee and later joined the Royal Navy on board the sloop Trial. He rose to be admiral and in October 1797 defeated the Dutch fleet off Camperdown (north of Haarlem). This was seen as one of the most significant actions in naval history.<ref>Laughton, John Knox (1888). "Duncan, Adam". In Stephen, Leslie. Dictionary of National Biography. 16.

The economy of medieval Dundee centred on the export of raw wool, with the production of finished textiles being a reaction to recession in the 15th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Whatley|Swinfen|Smith|1993|pp=28–30 }}</ref> Two government Acts in the mid 18th century had a profound effect on Dundee's industrial success: the textile industry was revolutionised by the introduction of large four-storey mills, stimulated in part by the 1742 Bounty Act which provided a government-funded subsidy on [[Osnaburg]] linen produced for export.<ref>{{harvnb|McKean|Swan|Archibald|2009|p=274}}; {{harvnb|Whatley|1992|p=23}}; {{harvnb|Checkland|Checkland|1989|p=45}}; {{harvnb|Durie|1979|pp=27, 52, 146–147 }}</ref> Expansion of the [[whaling]] industry was triggered by the second Bounty Act, introduced in 1750 to increase Britain's maritime and naval skill base.<ref>{{harvnb|McKean|Swan|Archibald|2009|p=275 }}</ref> Dundee, and Scotland more generally, saw rapid population increase at end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, with the city's population increasing from 12,400 in 1751 to 30,500 in 1821.<ref name="Smout 1998 240–248">{{harvnb|Smout|1998|pp=240–248 }}</ref>

The phasing out of the linen export bounty between 1825 and 1832 stimulated demand for cheaper textiles, particularly for cheaper, tough fabrics.<ref>{{harvnb|Durie|1979|p=169 }}</ref> The discovery that the dry fibres of [[jute]] could be lubricated with [[whale oil]] (of which Dundee had a surfeit, following the opening of its gasworks) to allow it to be processed in mechanised mills resulted in the Dundee mills rapidly converting from linen to jute, which sold at a quarter of the price of flax.<ref>{{harvnb|Turnock|1982|pp=60, 122}}; {{harvnb|Watson|1990|p=14}}; {{harvnb|Watson|2004|p=94 }}</ref> Interruption of [[Prussia]]n flax imports during the [[Crimean War]] and of cotton during the [[American Civil War]] resulted in a period of inflated prosperity for Dundee and the jute industry dominated Dundee throughout the latter half of the 19th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Lenman|Lythe|Gauldie|1969|pp=23–24}}; {{harvnb|Stewart|1998|p=1}}; {{harvnb|Checkland|Checkland|1989|p=48 }}</ref> Unprecedented immigration, notably of Irish workers, led to accelerated urban expansion, and at the height of the industry's success, Dundee supported 62 jute mills, employing some 50,000 workers.<ref>{{harvnb|Swift|Gilley|1989|pp=117–118}}; {{harvnb|Dundee Heritage Trust|1998|pp=1–3 }}</ref> Cox Brothers, who owned the massive [[Camperdown Works]] in [[Lochee]], were one of the largest jute manufacturers in Europe and employed more than 5,000 workers.<ref name="MS6">{{cite web |title=MS 6 Cox Brothers Ltd, Jute Spinners and Manufacturers, and Cox Family Papers |url=http://arccat.dundee.ac.uk/dserve.exe?&dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=show.tcl&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqPos=2&dsqSearch=((text)=%27cox%20brothers%27) |work=Archive Services Online Catalogue |publisher=[[University of Dundee]] |access-date=5 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206030933/http://arccat.dundee.ac.uk/dserve.exe?&dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=show.tcl&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqPos=2&dsqSearch=((text)=%27cox%20brothers%27) |archive-date=6 February 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The rise of the textile industries brought with it an expansion of supporting industries, notably of the whaling, maritime and shipbuilding industries,<ref>{{harvnb|Jackson|Kinnear|1990|pp=16–22 }}</ref> and extensive development of the waterfront area started in 1815 to cope with increased demand for port capacity.<ref>{{harvnb|McCarthy|2007|p=80}}; {{harvnb|Kenefick|2000|pp=38–50 }}</ref> At its height, 200 ships per year were built there, including [[Robert Falcon Scott]]'s Antarctic research vessel, the {{ship|RRS|Discovery}}.

While the city's economy was dominated by the jute industry, it also became known for smaller industries. Most notable among these were [[Keiller's marmalade|James Keiller's and Sons]], established in 1795, which pioneered commercial [[marmalade]] production,<ref>{{harvnb|Mathew|1998|p=12 }}</ref> and the publishing firm [[DC Thomson]], which was founded in the city in 1905. Dundee was said to be built on the 'three Js': Jute, Jam and Journalism.

The town was also the location of one of the worst rail disasters in British history, the [[Tay Bridge disaster]]. The first [[Tay Rail Bridge]] was opened in 1878. It collapsed some 18 months later during a storm, as a passenger train passed over it, resulting in the loss of 75 lives.<ref>{{harvnb|Lewis|2004|p=69 }}</ref> The [[1906 Dundee fire|most destructive fire in the city's history]] came in 1906, reportedly sending "rivers of burning whisky" through the street.

===20th and 21st centuries===

The jute industry fell into decline in the early 20th century, partly due to reduced demand for jute products and partly due to an inability to compete with the emerging industry in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]].<ref>{{harvnb|Roul|2009|p=103}}; {{harvnb|Stewart|1998|pp=16–17}}; {{harvnb|Stewart|2011|p=37 }}</ref> This gave rise to unemployment levels far in excess of the national average, peaking in the inter-war period,<ref>{{harvnb|Whatley|1990|p=45}}; {{harvnb|Devine|Lee|Peden|2005|p=166 }}</ref> but major recovery was seen in the post-war period, thanks to the arrival first of American light engineering companies like [[Timex Group|Timex]] and [[NCR Corporation|NCR]], and subsequent expansion into microelectronics.<ref>{{harvnb|Devine|Lee|Peden|2005|p=169}}; {{harvnb|Cortada|1993|p=237}}; {{harvnb|Knox|McKinlay|2011|p=266 }}</ref>

Dundee was the first city in Scotland to gain official [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]], after [[Queen Victoria]] signed a patent announcing the transition of Dundee from a royal burgh into a city. Dundee would officially gain city status on 26 January 1889. The patent still exists and is kept in storage in the city archives.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Milne |first=Scott |date=26 January 2024 |title=Dundee celebrates 135 years as Scotland's oldest city — and here's why |url=https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/dundee/815091/dundee-is-scotlands-oldest-city/ |access-date=12 August 2024 |website=The Courier |language=en-GB }}</ref>

[[File:City Chambers, Dundee, Scotland.jpg|thumb|[[Dundee City Chambers]], where the city council meets]]

=== Representation ===
Dundee City is one of 32 [[council areas of Scotland]], administered by [[Dundee City Council]].<ref name="localgovact" /> The council meets at [[Dundee City Chambers]] in City Square and has its mains offices at [[Dundee House]] on North Lindsay Street. The civic head and chair of the council is the [[Lord Provost of Dundee|Lord Provost]]. The council area is also divided into eighteen [[List of community council areas in Scotland#Dundee City|community council areas]], three of which ([[Broughty Ferry]], [[City Centre, Dundee|City Centre and Harbour]], and [[West End, Dundee|West End]]) had community councils operating as at August 2024.<ref>{{cite web |title=Community Councils and Community Groups |url=https://www.dundeecity.gov.uk/service-area/neighbourhood-services/communities-safety-and-protection/community-councils-and-community-groups |website=Dundee City Council |access-date=9 August 2024 }}</ref>

For elections to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] at [[Westminster Palace|Westminster]], the city area and portions of the [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]] council area are divided into two [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituencies]].<ref name="borders">{{harvnb|Fifth Periodical Review of Constituencies }}</ref> The constituencies of [[Arbroath and Broughty Ferry (UK Parliament constituency)|Arbroath and Broughty Ferry]] and [[Dundee West (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee West]] are represented by [[Stephen Gethins]] ([[Scottish National Party]])<ref>{{harvnb|Stephen Gethins, MP for Dundee East }}</ref> and [[Chris Law]] (Scottish National Party), respectively, both of whom were elected and re-elected respectively at the [[2024 United Kingdom general election|2024 general election]]. For elections to the [[Scottish Parliament]] at [[Scottish Parliament Building|Holyrood]], the city area is divided across three constituencies. The [[Dundee City East (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Dundee City East constituency]] and the [[Dundee City West (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Dundee City West constituency]] are entirely within the city area. The [[Angus South (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Angus South (Holyrood) constituency]] includes north-eastern and north-western portions of the city area.<ref name="borders" /> All three constituencies are within the [[North East Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|North East Scotland electoral region]]: [[Shona Robison]] (SNP) is the [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) for the Dundee East constituency;<ref>{{harvnb|Shona Robison, MSP for Dundee East }}</ref> [[Joe Fitzpatrick]] (SNP) is the current MSP for the Dundee West constituency<ref>{{harvnb|Joe Fitzpatrick, MSP for Dundee West }}</ref> and [[Graeme Dey]] (SNP) is the current MSP for the Angus South constituency.<ref>{{harvnb|Graeme Dey, MSP for Angus South }}</ref>

===Administrative history===

The apocryphal toponym {{lang|la|Dei Donum}} was applied by [[Hector Boece]] in the 16th century: {{harvnb|Ferguson|1998|pp=60–61 }}</ref>

Dundee was declared a city in 1889, being the first Scottish place to have the title of city explicitly conferred on it rather than assuming it by customary usage.<ref name=Milne/> In 1894, Dundee was made a [[county of city|county of itself]], removing it from [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Dundee Corporation Act 1894 (57 & 58 Vict. c.lxxiv) |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Vict/57-58/74/contents/enacted |website=legislation.gov.uk |publisher=The National Archives |access-date=5 February 2023 |archive-date=5 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230205100545/https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Vict/57-58/74/contents/enacted |url-status=live }}</ref> The city's boundaries were enlarged on numerous occasions, notably in 1913 when it absorbed the neighbouring burgh of [[Broughty Ferry]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Dundee Burgh Extension Act 1831 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Will4/1-2/46/contents/enacted |website=legislation.gov.uk |publisher=The National Archives |access-date=6 August 2024 |archive-date=6 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240806080055/https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Will4/1-2/46/contents/enacted |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Dundee Boundaries Act 1913 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Geo5/3-4/80/contents/enacted |website=legislation.gov.uk |publisher=The National Archives |access-date=6 August 2024 |archive-date=6 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240806080055/https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Geo5/3-4/80/contents/enacted |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Dundee Scottish County of City |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10262847#tab02 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=6 August 2024 |archive-date=6 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240806080055/https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10262847#tab02 |url-status=live }}</ref>

From 1975 to 1996, Dundee was governed by the City of Dundee District Council, one of three district-level authorities within the [[Tayside]] region. The district was created under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]] and covered a larger area than the pre-1975 city, taking in the burgh of [[Monifieth]] and most of the [[List of local government areas in Scotland (1930–1975)#Sub-county authorities|landward district]] of Monifieth (covering a number of villages north of Dundee) from Angus, and the parish of [[Longforgan]] (which included [[Invergowrie]]) from [[Perthshire]].<ref>{{cite legislation UK |type=act |act=Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 |year=1973 |chapter=65 |access-date=6 August 2024 }}</ref> In 1996, the Dundee City council area was created under the [[Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994]].<ref name="localgovact">{{harvnb|Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 }}</ref> Monifieth and the villages north of Dundee itself were transferred back to Angus, and the Longforgan area (including Invergowrie) was transferred to [[Perth and Kinross]], largely reinstating the pre-1975 boundaries.

===Independence referendum===
On 18 September 2014, Dundee was one of four council areas to vote "Yes" in the [[Scottish independence referendum]], with 57.3% voting "Yes" on a 78.8% turnout. With the highest Yes vote for any local authority in Scotland, some in the [[Yes Scotland]] campaign nicknamed Dundee the "Yes City", including former First Minister [[Alex Salmond]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Scotland Decides |work=BBC |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/events/scotland-decides/live |access-date=21 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180609121516/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/events/scotland-decides/live |archive-date=9 June 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Scottish Independence |work=The Scotsman |url=http://www.scotsman.com/scottish-independence/alex-salmond-dundee-is-scotlands-yes-city/ |access-date=19 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231234703/http://www.scotsman.com/scottish-independence/alex-salmond-dundee-is-scotlands-yes-city/ |archive-date=31 December 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:The Dundee Law - geograph.org.uk - 63200 (lighter ground).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Dundee Law]]]]
Dundee sits on the north bank of the [[Firth of Tay]] on the eastern, [[North Sea]] Coast of Scotland. The city lies {{convert| 36.1|mi|km|0}} [[Boxing the compass|NNE]] of [[Edinburgh]]<ref name="postcode">{{harvnb|UK Postcode to Postcode Calculator }}</ref> and {{convert|360.6|mi|km|0}} [[Boxing the compass|NNW]] of London.<ref name="postcode"/> The built-up area occupies a roughly rectangular shape {{convert|8.3|mi|km|0}} long by {{convert|2.5|mi|km|0}} wide, aligned in an east to west direction and occupies an area of {{convert|60|km2|sqmi}}.<ref name=OSmap/><ref name=popdens>{{harvnb|Population density: Scotland: by unitary authority }}</ref> The town is bisected by a line of hills stretching from Balgay Hill (elevation of 143 m) in the west end of the city, through the [[Dundee Law]] (174 m) which occupies the centre of the built up area, to Gallow Hill (83 m), between [[Baxter Park]] and the Eastern Cemetery. North of this ridge lies a valley through which cuts the Dighty Water [[burn (topography)|burn]], the elevation falling to around 45 m. North of the Dighty valley lie the [[Sidlaw Hills]], the most prominent hill being [[Craigowl Hill]] (455 m).<ref name=OSmap>{{harvnb|Ordnance Survey Landranger Map|2007 }}</ref>
[[File:Approaching Dundee from the south on the East Coast Railway Line - geograph.org.uk - 3426132.jpg|thumb|A cityscape from the Tay]]
The western and eastern boundaries of the city are marked by two [[burn (topography)|burns]] that are tributaries of the [[River Tay]]. On the westernmost boundary of the city, the Lochee burn meets the Fowlis burn, forming the [[Invergowrie]] burn, which meets the Tay at Invergowrie basin.<ref name=OSmap/> The Dighty Water enters Dundee from the village of [[Strathmartine]] and marks the boundaries of a number of northern districts of the city, joining the Tay between [[Barnhill, Dundee|Barnhill]] and [[Monifieth]].<ref name=OSmap/> The Scouring burn in the west end of the city and Dens Burn in the east, both of which played important roles in the industrial development of the city, have now been [[culvert]]ed over.

=== Geology ===
The city lies within the Sidlaw-Ochil [[anticline]], and the predominant bedrock type is [[Old Red Sandstone]] of the Arbuthnott-Garvock group.<ref name=geo>{{harvnb|Bluck|2000|p=422}}; {{harvnb|GeoIndex Onshore }}</ref> [[Differential weathering]] of a series of [[igneous intrusion]]s has yielded a number of prominent hills in the landscape, most notably the [[Law, Dundee|Dundee Law]] (a late [[Silurian]]/early [[Devonian]] [[Mafic]] rock intrusion) and Balgay hill (a [[Felsic]] rock intrusion of similar age).<ref name=geo/> In the east of the city, in [[Craigiebank, Dundee|Craigie]] and [[Broughty Ferry]], the bedrock geology is of [[extrusive rock]]s, including mafic [[lava]] and [[tuff]].<ref name=geo/>

The land surrounding Dundee, particularly that in the lower lying areas to the west and east of the city, bears high quality soil that is particularly suitable for arable farming. It is predominantly of a [[brown forest soil]] type with some [[Gley soil|gleying]], the lower parts being formed from raised beach sands and gravels derived from Old Red Sandstone and lavas.<ref>{{harvnb|Soil Survey of Scotland|1982 }}</ref>

=== Urban environment ===
[[File:Midsummer night^ - geograph.org.uk - 9752.jpg|View from The Law, overlooking Dundee City Centre and the Tay Road Bridge|thumb|left]]
Very little of pre-[[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] Dundee remains, the destruction suffered in the [[War of the Rough Wooing]] being almost total, with only scattered, roofless shells remaining.<ref>{{harvnb|Merriman|2000|pp=360–361 }}</ref> The area occupied by the medieval burgh of Dundee extends between East Port and West Port, which formerly held the gates to the walled city.

[[File:Fog in the Tay estuary - geograph.org.uk - 9750.jpg|[[Haar (fog)]] travelling up the [[River Tay]] by [[advection]]|thumb|right]]
The climate, like the rest of lowland Scotland, is [[Oceanic climate|Oceanic]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen-Geiger]] classification Cfb).<ref>{{harvnb|Peel|Finlayson|McMahon|2007 }}</ref> Mean temperature and rainfall are typical for the east coast of Scotland, and with the city's sheltered estuarine position, mean daily maxima are slightly higher than coastal areas to the North, particularly in spring and summer.<ref>{{harvnb|Regional mapped climate averages }}</ref> The summers are still chilly when compared with similar latitudes in continental Europe, something compensated for by the mild winters, similar to the rest of the British Isles. The nearest official [[Met Office]] weather station is Mylnefield, [[Invergowrie]] which is about {{convert|4|mi|km}} west of the City Centre.

A record high of {{convert|29.3|C|F}} was recorded in July 2013.{{Citation needed|date=February 2023}} The warmest month was July 2006,<ref>{{harvnb|Jul 2006 Mean }}</ref> with an average temperature of {{convert|17.4|C|F}} (average high {{convert|22.5|C|F}}, average low {{convert|12.3|C|F}}). In an 'average' year the warmest day should reach<ref>{{harvnb|1971–2000 average warmest day }}</ref> {{convert|25.2|C|F}}, and in total just 1.86 days<ref name="climate-datas-weather.dynalias.org">{{cite web |url=http://climate-datas-weather.dynalias.org/listenormale-1991-2020-5-p183.php |title=Climate Data}} {{dead link|date=October 2021 }}</ref> should equal or exceed a temperature of {{convert|25.0|C|F}} per year, illustrating the rarity of such warmth.

On average, 4.73 days should record a minimum temperature at or below -5&nbsp;°C and there are 53.26 days of air frost on average. From 1991 to 2020, Mylnefield averaged 0.9 ice days, 50 days with precipitation of more than 5mm and 19.56 days with more than 10mm. The weather station is in plant hardiness zone 10a.<ref name="climate-datas-weather.dynalias.org"/>

===Population===

Dundee's recorded population reached a peak of 182,204 at the 1971 census. According to the 2011 census, the City of Dundee had a population of 147,268.<ref name="Dundee 2011 Population" /> A more recent population estimate of the City of Dundee has been recorded at 149,680 in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Dundee City Council Area Profile |url=https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/statistics/council-area-data-sheets/dundee-city-council-profile.html |access-date=9 October 2022 |website=www.nrscotland.gov.uk |archive-date=5 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221005231716/https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files//statistics/council-area-data-sheets/dundee-city-council-profile.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The demographic make-up of the population is much in line with the rest of Scotland. The age group from 30 to 44 forms the largest portion of the population (20%).<ref name="Dundee Population" /> The median age of males and females living in Dundee was 37 and 40 years, respectively, compared to 37 and 39 years for those in the whole of Scotland.<ref name="Dundee Population" />

===Residents===

The place of birth of the town's residents was 94.16% United Kingdom (including 87.85% from Scotland), 0.42% Ireland, 1.33% from other [[European Union]] (EU) countries, and 3.09% from elsewhere in the world.

Natives of Dundee are called Dundonians and are often recognisable by their distinctive dialect of [[Scots language|Scots]] as well as their [[Accent (dialect)|accent]], which most noticeably substitutes the [[monophthong]] /ɛ/ (pronounced "eh") in place of the [[diphthong]] /aj/ (pronounced "ai").<ref>{{harvnb|McCluskey|1991}}; {{harvnb|Dundee Scots }}</ref> Dundee, and Scotland more generally, saw rapid population increase at end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, with the city's population increasing from 12,400 in 1751 to 30,500 in 1821.<ref name="Smout 1998 240–248"/> Of particular significance was an influx of Irish workers in the early to mid-19th century, attracted by the prospect of employment in the textiles industries. In 1851, 18.9% of people living in Dundee were of Irish birth.<ref>{{harvnb|Swift|Gilley|1989|p=117}}; {{harvnb|Little Tipperary: The Irish in Lochee }}</ref>

The city has also attracted immigrants from Italy, fleeing poverty and famine, in the 19th century Jews, fleeing from the Russia controlled portions of partitioned Poland and from German occupation in the 20th. Today, Dundee has a sizeable [[ethnic minority]] population, and has around 4,000 Asian residents which is the fourth-largest Asian community in Scotland. The city also has 1.0% of residents from a Black/African/Caribbean background.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/documents/censusresults/release2a/rel2asbfigure4.pdf |title=Figure 4: Minority ethnic groups by council area, Scotland, 2011 |access-date=30 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022230302/http://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/documents/censusresults/release2a/rel2asbfigure4.pdf |archive-date=22 October 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Students===

Dundee has a higher proportion of university students – one in seven of the population – than any other town in Europe, except [[Heidelberg]].<ref name="Dundee Student Population">{{cite web |title=History of Dundee |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/scotland/central-scotland/dundee/history |website=Lonely Planet |access-date=28 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205082656/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/scotland/central-scotland/dundee/history |archive-date=5 December 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> The 14.2% come from all around the world to attend the local universities and colleges. Dundee is a major attraction for Northern Irish students who make up 5% of the total student population. The city's universities are believed to hold the highest percentage of Northern Irish students outside of Northern Ireland and have a big impact on the local economy and culture. However, this has declined in recent years due to the increase of tuition fees for students elsewhere in the UK. Dundee also has a lot of students from abroad, mostly from the Republic of Ireland and other [[EU countries]] but with an increasing number from countries from the Far East and [[Nigeria]].<ref name="population">{{harvnb|Population Matters }}</ref>

[[File:Dundee Parish Church, St Mary's.jpg|thumb|Dundee Parish Church, St Mary's is one of three of the Dundee's ''City Churches'' which are joined; only two function as places of worship: St. Mary's and St. Clement's (the Old Steeple) which can be seen in the background.]]

The [[Church of Scotland]] [[Presbyterian polity|Presbytery]] of Dundee is responsible for overseeing the worship of 37 congregations in and around the Dundee area, although changing population patterns have led to some of the churches becoming linked charges.<ref>{{harvnb|Presbytery of Dundee }}</ref> Due to their city centre location, the City Churches, [[Dundee Parish Church (St Mary's)]] and the [[Steeple Church]], are the most prominent [[Church of Scotland]] buildings in Dundee. They are on the site of the medieval parish kirk of [[St Mary]], of which only the 15th-century west tower survives. The attached church was once the largest parish church in medieval Scotland.<ref>{{harvnb|McKean|2009|p=5 }}</ref>

Dundee was unusual among Scottish medieval burghs in having two parish kirks; the second, dedicated to [[Pope Clement I|St Clement]], has disappeared, but its site was approximately that of the present City Square.<ref>{{harvnb|McKean|Walker|1985|p=52 }}</ref> Other presbyterian groups include the Free Church which meet at St. Peters (the historic church of [[Robert Murray McCheyne|Robert Murray M'Cheyne]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=St. Peter's Free Church, Dundee |url=https://stpeters-dundee.org.uk/ |access-date=26 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628060251/https://stpeters-dundee.org.uk/ |archive-date=28 June 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In the [[Middle Ages]] Dundee was also the site of houses of the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] (Blackfriars), and [[Franciscans]] (Greyfriars), and had a number of hospitals and chapels. These establishments were sacked during the [[Scottish Reformation]], in the mid-16th century, and were reduced to burial grounds, now Barrack Street (also referred to as the Dek-tarn street) and [[The Howff]] burial ground, respectively.<ref>{{harvnb|Mackie|1836|p=120}}; {{harvnb|Foggie|2003|p=35 }}</ref>

{{see|Economy of Scotland}}
[[File:Cox's Stack - geograph.org.uk - 2895123.jpg|right|thumb|Cox's Stack, a chimney from the former [[Camperdown Works]] jute mill. The chimney takes its name from jute baron James Cox who later became [[List of Lord Provosts of Dundee|Provost]] of the city.]]

In 1911 40% of the city's population was employed in the jute industry. By 1951 this had dropped to 20%, and now is effectively zero.<ref>The Dundee Book, Billy Kay</ref> The period following World War II was notable for the transformation of the city's economy. While jute still employed one-fifth of the working population, new industries were attracted and encouraged. [[NCR Corporation]] selected Dundee as the base of operations for the UK in late 1945,<ref name="ncr">{{harvnb|NCR Cash Advance }}</ref> primarily because of the lack of damage the city had sustained in the war, good transport links and high productivity from long hours of sunshine. Production started in the year before the official opening of the plant on 11 June 1947. A fortnight after the tenth anniversary of the plant the 250,000th cash register was produced. By the 1960s, NCR had become the principal employer of the city producing [[cash register]]s, and later [[Automatic Teller Machine|ATMs]], at several of its Dundee plants. The firm developed magnetic-strip readers for cash registers and produced early computers.<ref>{{harvnb|First Dundee computer next year }}</ref> Astral, a Dundee-based firm that manufactured and sold [[refrigerators]] and [[Clothes dryer|spin dryers]] was merged into [[Morphy Richards]] and rapidly expanded to employ over 1,000 people. The development in Dundee of a [[Michelin]] [[tire|tyre]]-production facility helped to absorb the unemployment caused by the decline of the jute industry, particularly with the abolition of the jute control by the [[Board of Trade]] on 30 April 1969.<ref>{{harvnb|General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade 1969 }}</ref>

Employment in Dundee changed dramatically during the 1980s with the loss of nearly 10,000 manufacturing jobs due to closure of the shipyards, cessation of carpet manufacturing and the disappearance of the jute trade. To combat growing unemployment and declining economic conditions, Dundee was declared an [[Enterprise Zone]] in January 1984. In 1983, the first [[ZX Spectrum]] [[home computers]] were produced in Dundee by [[Timex Group USA|Timex]]. In the same year the company broke production records, despite a [[sit-in]] by workers protesting against job cuts and plans to demolish one of the factory buildings to make way for a supermarket. Timex closed its Dundee plant in 1993 following an acrimonious six-month [[industrial dispute]].<ref>{{harvnb|Timex pulls the plug on Dundee plant}}; {{harvnb|Scott|2002|pp=163–165 }}</ref> The Michelin Tyre factory closed in June 2020, with the loss of 850 jobs.<ref>{{cite news |title=Michelin's Dundee factory closes gates for final time |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-53234736 |work=BBC News |date=30 June 2020 |access-date=5 October 2020 |archive-date=2 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201002190324/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-53234736 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Transport ==

===Road===

Dundee is served by the [[A90 road]], which connects the city to the [[M90 motorway|M90]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] in the west with [[Forfar]] and [[Aberdeen]] in the north. The part of the road that is in the city is a [[dual carriageway]] and forms the city's main bypass on its north side, known as the Kingsway. East of the A90's Forfar Road junction, the Kingsway East continues as the [[A972 road|A972]] and meets the [[A92 road|A92]] at the Scott Fyffe roundabout. Travelling east, the A92 connects the city to [[Arbroath]] and [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]] and to the south with [[Fife]], via the [[Tay Road Bridge]].

The [[A930 road|A930]] links the city with coastal settlements to the east, including [[Monifieth]] and [[Carnoustie]]. Progressing westward from where the A92 meets the Tay Road Bridge at the Riverside Roundabout, the [[A85 road|A85]] follows the southern boundary of the city along Riverside Drive and towards the A90 at the Swallow Roundabout. The A85 multiplexes with the A90 and diverges again at Perth.

Also meeting the A92 and A85 at the Riverside Roundabout is the [[A991 road|A991]] Inner Ring Road, which surrounds the perimeter of the city centre, returning to the A92 on the east side of the Tay Road Bridge. The [[A923 road|A923]] Dundee to [[Dunkeld]] road meets the A991 at the Dudhope Roundabout, and the [[A929 road|A929]] links the A991 to the A90 via Forfar Road.

===Bus===

Dundee has an extensive network of bus routes. The [[Seagate bus station]] is the city's main terminus for journeys out of town. [[Xplore Dundee]] operates most of the intra-city services, with other more rural services operated by [[Stagecoach Strathtay]] and Moffat & Williamson.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bustimes.org/localities/dundee-city-centre |title=Dundee City Centre – Bus Times |access-date=2 August 2023 |archive-date=2 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230802170630/https://bustimes.org/localities/dundee-city-centre |url-status=live }}</ref> The city's two railway stations are the main [[Dundee railway station|Dundee station]], near the waterfront, which has now finished re-construction as part of the waterfront re-development programme and the much smaller [[Broughty Ferry railway station|Broughty Ferry station]] at the eastern end of the city.

[[File:St. Mary's Tower, Dundee - geograph.org.uk - 1204975.jpg|thumb|left|180px|St Mary's Tower, oldest building in Dundee, dating to late 15th century]]

The city and its landscape are dominated by [[Law, Dundee|The Law]] and the [[Firth of Tay]]. The Law, a large hill to the north of the [[City Centre, Dundee|City Centre]] was the site of an [[Iron Age]] [[Hill Fort]], upon which the Law War Memorial, designed by Thomas Braddock, was erected in 1921 to commemorate the fallen of [[World War I]].<ref>{{harvnb|Law Hill War Memorial, Category B listing }}</ref> The waterfront, much altered by [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] in the 19th century, retains several of the docks that once were the hub of the jute and whaling industries, including the Camperdown and Victoria Docks.<ref>{{harvnb|Camperdown Dock, Category A listing}}<br />{{harvnb|Victoria Dock with Pedestrian and Vehicular Swing Bridges, Category A listing }}</ref> The Victoria Dock is the home of the frigate [[HMS Unicorn (1824)|HMS ''Unicorn'']] and the [[North Carr Lightship]], while [[Robert Falcon Scott|Captain Scott]]'s [[RRS Discovery|RRS ''Discovery'']] occupies Craig Pier, from where the ferries to [[Fife]] once sailed.

As a result of the destruction suffered during the [[Rough Wooing]], little of the mediaeval city (aside from St Mary's Tower) remains and the earliest surviving domestic structures date from the [[Scotland in the Early Modern Era|Early Modern Era]]. A notable example is the Wishart Arch (or East Port) in Cowgate. It is the last surviving portion of the city walls. Dating from prior to 1548, it owes its continued existence to its association with the Protestant [[martyr]] [[George Wishart]], who is said to have preached to plague victims from the East Port in 1544.<ref>{{harvnb|Historic Environment Scotland|SM164}}<br />{{harvnb|McKean|Walker|1985|pp=32–33 }}</ref> Another is the building complex on the High Street known as [[Gardyne's Land, Dundee|Gardyne's Land]], parts of which date from around 1560.<ref>{{harvnb|70–73 (Inclusive Nos) High Street, Including Gardyne's Land, Gray's Close and Clock with Model of the Town House}}; {{harvnb|McKean|Walker|1985|p=18}}; {{harvnb|Dragging a building into the 21st century}}; {{harvnb|Gardyne's Land wins multiple awards }}</ref> [[The Howff]] burial ground in the northern part of the City Centre also dates from this time; it was given to the city by Mary Queen of Scots in 1564, having previously served as the grounds of a [[Franciscan]] abbey.<ref>{{harvnb|Meadowside and Barrack Street, The Howff, Category A listing}}; {{harvnb|McKean|Walker|1985|pp=50–51 }}</ref>

[[File:Claypotts castle 01.jpg|thumb|right|Claypotts Castle, dating from the late 16th century]]
