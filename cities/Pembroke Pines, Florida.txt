'''Pembroke Pines''' is a city in southern [[Broward County, Florida]], United States. The city is located 22 miles (35&nbsp;km) north of [[Miami]]. It is a suburb of and the fourth-most populous city in the [[Miami metropolitan area]]. The population of Pembroke Pines was 171,178 at the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Florida; Broward County, Florida; Pembroke Pines city, Florida|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/FL,browardcountyflorida,pembrokepinescityflorida/PST045221|access-date=2022-01-28|website=www.census.gov|language=en}}</ref>

==History==
Pembroke Pines was officially incorporated on January 16, 1960. The city's name, Pembroke Pines, is traced back to [[Edward Reed (naval architect)|Sir Edward J. Reed]], a member of [[British Parliament|Britain's Parliament]] for the [[Pembroke, Pembrokeshire|County of Pembroke]] from 1874 to 1880, who in 1882, formed the Florida Land and Mortgage Company to purchase from [[Hamilton Disston]] a total of 2 million acres of mostly [[swampland]] located throughout the southern half of Florida.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wilkins |first=Mira |date=1989 |title=The History of Foreign Investment in the United States to 1914 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eZkaMjTzBdcC |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=234 |isbn=0-674-39666-9 }}</ref><ref name="ss">{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Nolin |title=How did Pembroke name come to Pines and Park? |url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/pembroke-pines/fl-pembroke-name-brow100-20141130-story.html |work=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]] |date=November 30, 2014 |access-date=2019-09-09}}</ref> A road put through one of the tracts came to be known as Pembroke Road.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |date=July 2, 2023 |title=Pembroke Pines - A Look Back |url=https://www.ppines.com/DocumentCenter/View/786/HistoryWeb?bidId= |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401024507/http://www.ppines.com/DocumentCenter/View/786/HistoryWeb?bidId= |archive-date=April 1, 2019 |access-date=July 2, 2023 |website=The City of Pembroke Pines}}</ref> When incorporating the city, Walter Smith Kipnis, who became the city's first mayor, suggested the name Pembroke Pines because of the pine trees growing near Pembroke Road.<ref name=":0" />

The first inhabitants of the area were [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who first appeared about 4,000 years ago. Skeletal remains of animal hunters dating back about 10,000 years were found around Broward County, showing that perhaps human beings had lived in the area even earlier.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Historic Preservation Board History of Broward County |url=https://www.broward.org:443/History/pages/bchistory.aspx |access-date=2022-05-17 |website=www.broward.org |language=en}}</ref>

The community started as [[agricultural land]] occupied by [[dairy farm]]s, and grew after [[World War II]] as service members were retiring, including large eastern sections that were part of the [[Waldrep Dairy Farm]], including the present-day [[Pembroke Lakes Mall]]. The first two subdivisions were called Pembroke Pines. One of the first homes in the city belonged to Kipnis, the city's first mayor, and was built in 1956. It was then known as the "Village of Pembroke Pines" and was incorporated into a village in 1959. Builders contested the incorporation, so a legal battle ensued concerning the boundaries of the new municipality. City services were added in the 1960s with the building of the first fire department building near [[North Perry Airport]]. University Drive was then the western edge of habitable land for residents.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In January 1960, Pembroke Pines held another election, and the village became a city. This small property was less than a square mile and was between Hollywood Boulevard and SW 72nd Avenue, and had the [[Florida Turnpike]] to the east. Pembroke Pines sought to give citizens involvement, so they organized the Pembroke Pines Civic Association. The square-mile city was unable to expand due to North Perry Airport and the South Florida State Hospital. Joseph LaCroix, a developer, had his {{convert|320|acre|km2}} of land north of Pines Boulevard annexed to the city. This gave a new pathway to proceed westward. In 1977, a maximum security prison known as the [[Broward Correctional Institution]] was built in the northwestern part of town.  This facility closed in 2012.<ref>"Prison closings are a mixed bag, but mostly good". Highlands Today (Media General Communications Holdings, LLC.). 2012-01-16. Retrieved 2012-08-24.</ref> In 1980, property from [[State Road 823 (Florida)|Flamingo Road]] to [[U.S. Route 27 in Florida|U.S. 27]] was incorporated into Pembroke Pines, doubling the size of the city. This expansion included the property that is currently [[C.B. Smith Park]] as well as what was once the [[Hollywood Sportatorium]] and the [[Miami-Hollywood Motorsports Park]]. Also, in 1980, construction began to extend [[Interstate 75 in Florida|Interstate 75]] from U.S. 27 towards Miami, passing through the new western part of the city. By 1984 the expressway reached [[Florida State Road 820|Pines Boulevard]], the main east-west arterial road in the city.{{cn|date=October 2024}}

In May 1977, the [[Grateful Dead]] put on a storied performance at the Hollywood Sportatorium. Many [[Deadheads]] consider the version of "[[Sugaree]]" played during the first set to be the band's—and particularly guitarist [[Jerry Garcia]]'s—finest performance of the song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://headyversion.com/song/253/grateful-dead/sugaree/ |title=Grateful Dead - Sugaree |publisher=headyversion.com |access-date=2019-09-09}}</ref>

The city's rapid population growth in the mid-to late 1990s was part of the effect of [[Hurricane Andrew]] in 1992. Thousands of southern [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]] residents moved northward to Broward County, many to Pembroke Pines. The resulting boom ranked the City of Pembroke Pines third in a list of "Fastest Growing Cities" in the [[United States]], in 1999.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/southflorida/sfl-sgrowth21jun21,0,2542506.story?coll=sfla-home-headlines |title=Topic Galleries - South Florida |publisher=Sun-sentinel.com |access-date=2013-04-12 }}{{Dead link|date=May 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The increase in population has increased the need for schools. In 2003, [[Charles W. Flanagan High School]] had close to 6,000 students, making it the most populated high school in Florida. In response to Broward County's need to keep up with demands, Mayor Alex Fekete and City Manager Charles Dodge started a [[Charter schools|charter school system]]. As of 2006, Pembroke Pines had the largest charter school system in the county. The city is also home to campuses for [[Broward College]] and [[Florida International University]]. The city's population had grown from 65,452 in 1990 to 157,594 in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=kf7tgg1uo9ude_&met_y=population&idim=place:1255775&dl=en&hl=en&q=pembroke+pines+population+statistics|title=Population in the U.S. - Google Public Data Explorer|website=www.google.com}}</ref>

In 2001, Pembroke Pines was home to the most dangerous road intersection (Pines Boulevard and Flamingo Road) in the United States, according to [[State Farm Insurance]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.local10.com/news/846379/detail.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926235030/http://www.local10.com/news/846379/detail.html|url-status=dead|title=South Florida Intersection Tops Most Dangerous List - Miami News Story - WPLG Miami|archive-date=September 26, 2011}}</ref> City residents passed a bond initiative to allow the city to begin construction to redesign the intersection. The intersection has since been expanded with additional east/west Pines Boulevard lanes.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://miami.cbslocal.com/2012/07/23/is-a-broward-intersection-still-the-worst-in-the-nation/| title=Is A Broward Intersection Still The Worst In The Nation?| publisher=[[CBS Miami]]| access-date=October 8, 2016}}</ref>

As developers expanded Pembroke Pines westward, more hurricanes have affected the city and its residents. In 1999, [[Hurricane Irene (1999)|Hurricane Irene]] dumped up to {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rain in the city. The western communities, such as Chapel Trail and Silver Lakes, received an estimated {{convert|19|in|mm|abbr=on}}. Then in 2004, [[Hurricane Frances]] and [[Hurricane Jeanne|Jeanne]] passed to the north (Palm Beach County), but brought tropical storm-force winds and left minor tree and shrub damage. The [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005 hurricane season]] left a mark on the city. [[Hurricane Katrina]] passed directly over the city as a [[Saffir–Simpson scale#Category 1|category-one storm]].<ref name="KatrinaTCR">Knabb, Richard D.; Rhome, Jamie R. "{{NHC TCR url|id=AL122005_Katrina|title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Hurricane Katrina}}." ''[[National Hurricane Center]].'' December 20, 2005.</ref> In its wake, it left some damage, such as downed power lines and trees, especially in the Chapel Trail and Silver Lakes developments. In late October, the [[hurricane eye|eye]] of [[Hurricane Wilma]] passed about {{convert|20|mi|km}} toward the north of the city, which saw the strongest winds its residents had experienced in decades. The strongest wind officially recorded in the city was a {{convert|92|mph|km/h|adj=mid}} sustained wind, with a {{convert|101|mph|km/h|adj=mid}} wind gust. Most of the city was left without power for days, lights at intersections had been destroyed, a riot at a gas station led to it being closed, most landscaping was destroyed or damaged beyond repair, and minor structural damage (mainly roof and screen damage) occurred. In addition, schools remained closed for two weeks.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
