'''Cúcuta''' ({{IPA|es|ˈkukuta|lang|Es-Cúcuta-Word.ogg}}), officially '''San José de Cúcuta''', is a [[Colombian municipality]], capital of the department of [[Norte de Santander]] and nucleus of the [[Metropolitan Area of Cúcuta]]. The city is located in the homonymous valley, at the foot of the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Ranges]] of the [[Colombian Andes]], on the border with [[Venezuela]]. It comprises an area of approximately 1119 km<sup>2</sup>, with an urban area of 64 km<sup>2</sup> (divided into 10 communes) and a rural area of 1055 km<sup>2</sup> (divided into 10 townships).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cucutanortedesantander.micolombiadigital.gov.co/sites/cucutanortedesantander/content/files/000664/33172_producto-31_dts.pdf|title=Technical support document for the Territorial Planning Plan (POT) of San José de Cúcuta|page= 69,83|language=es|access-date=May 10, 2021|publisher=micolombiadigital.gov.co}}</ref> The city has a population of 777,106 inhabitants, which makes it the most populous municipality in the department and the [[List of Colombian municipalities by population|sixth most populous municipality in the country]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.portafolio.co/economia/estas-son-las-ciudades-mas-pobladas-del-pais-segun-el-censo-del-dane-534662|title=These are the most populated cities in the country, according to the Dane census|language=es|date=October 17, 2019|publisher=portafolio.co}}</ref> Similarly, its [[Metropolitan Area of Cúcuta|metropolitan area]] (made up of the municipalities of [[Villa del Rosario, Norte de Santander|Villa del Rosario]], [[Los Patios]], [[El Zulia]], [[San Cayetano, Norte de Santander|San Cayetano]] and [[Puerto Santander, Norte de Santander|Puerto Santander]]) has an approximate population of 1,046,347.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dane.gov.co/index.php/estadisticas-por-tema/demografia-y-poblacion/proyecciones-de-poblacion|title=Projections and retroprojections of the municipal population for the period 1985–2017 and 2018–2035 based on the CNPV 2018|language=es|access-date=May 24, 2021|publisher=dane.gov.co}}</ref>

The city was founded as a [[Parish (administrative division)|parish]] on June 17, 1733, by [[Juana Rangel de Cuéllar]], resident of [[Pamplona, Norte de Santander|Pamplona]] in the area under the name of ''San José de Guasimales'', as part of an initiative of the white and mestizo locals to separate themselves from the "Indian Village of Cúcuta" (currently San Luis Quarter). Later, the name was changed to San José de Cúcuta, castellanization of «Kuku-ta», in honor of the indigenous people of the region.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rincón Guerrero|first1=Amado Antonio|last2=Villamizar Pabón|first2=Silvano|last3=Frerreira Esparza|first3=Adriana|date=1998|title=Los pueblos del cacao: orígenes de los asentamientos urbanos en el oriente colombiano|trans-title=The Cocoa Peoples: Origins of Urban Settlements in Eastern Colombia|language=es|publisher=Universidad Industrial de Santander, Escuela de Historia|isbn=978-958-9318-55-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WoBEAAAAYAAJ|page=105-107}}</ref> From its foundation in the 18th century and throughout the Spanish viceroyalty, the parish was consolidated as one of the most important settlements of the Colombian East and Spanish America,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.banrepcultural.org/biblioteca-virtual/credencial-historia/numero-234/cucuta-ciudad-comercial-y-fronteriza |title=Cúcuta: ciudad comercial y fronteriza |trans-title=Cúcuta: commercial and border city |access-date=September 11, 2021 |last1=Gamboa |first1=Jorge Augusto |website=banrepcultural.org |publisher=Red Cultural del Banco de la República |language=es}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://revistas.unimilitar.edu.co/index.php/dere/article/view/2535 |title=De la Gran Colombia a la Nueva Granada, contexto histórico – político de la transición constitucional |trans-title=From Greater Colombia to New Granada, historical context – political transition of the Constitution |date=November 22, 2007 |access-date=June 17, 2021 |last1=Blanco |first1=Jacqueline |journal=Prolegómenos |volume=10 |issue=20 |pages=71–87 |publisher=Universidad Militar Nueva Granada |doi=10.18359/prole.2535 |language=es|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.quintadebolivar.gov.co/exposicion/Documents/Campan%CC%83a%20admirable.pdf |title=Campaña Admirable y guerra a muerte |trans-title=Admirable Campaign and war to the death |date=June 3, 2013 |access-date=June 17, 2021 |website=quintadebolivar.gov.co |publisher=Casa Museo Quinta de Bolívar |language=es}}</ref> receiving in 1792 the title of «Very Noble, Valiant and Loyal Village» by King [[Charles IV of Spain]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historia de Cúcuta: la casa del duende|trans-title=History of Cúcuta: the house of the goblin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xf5rAAAAMAAJ|publisher=La Casa del Duende|date=1990|access-date=June 22, 2021|language=es|first1=Rafael Eduardo|last1=Ángel}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The city has a name composed in the manner of almost all the Spanish foundations in America: San José (one of the most widespread names in the continent thanks to the devotions of San José in Spain), honors [[Saint Joseph]]. The name of Cúcuta was taken in honor of the cacique Kuku-ta «Cúcuta in Spanish» and represents the [[Motilon people|Motilon-Bari]] indigenous people who inhabited the region before the conquest.<ref name="Villa" /> Kuku-ta in the native language means "House of the Goblin".<ref name="Kuku-ta">{{Cite web|url=https://www.asiescucuta.com/index.php/en/life-style/item/10980-kuku-ta-la-casa-del-duende|title=KUKU-TA la Casa del Duende|trans-title=KUKU-TA the House of the Goblin|last1=Laguado Nieto|first1=Omar Elías|date=May 18, 2018|website=asiescucuta.com|publisher=Así es Cúcuta|language=es}}</ref> The city was known as San José de Guasimales from 1733 to 1793,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.portafolio.co/archivo/documento/MAM-2257062 |title=San José de Guasimales, Valle de Cúcuta |format=Digital |publisher=Portafolio |access-date=January 15, 2016}}</ref> when it changed to its current name.

The coat of arms of the city has the legend that it says «Muy Noble, Valerosa y Leal Villa de San José de Cúcuta» ''Very Noble, Valiant and Loyal Village of San José de Cúcuta'', title that was granted to him by means of royal card in just recognition to his laborious sons, shortly before the end of the century, by the King [[Charles IV of Spain]]. This was possible thanks to the help of the lawyer of the Royal Audience José María Maldona, who was in charge of legally presenting before the [[José Manuel de Ezpeleta, 1st Count of Ezpeleta de Beire|Viceroy José Manuel de Ezpeleta]] the presentation of the title of village on behalf of the inhabitants of the city.<ref name="Villa">{{Cite web|url=https://www.laopinion.com.co/columnistas/la-fundacion-de-cucuta-mito-y-realidad |title=La fundación de Cúcuta, mito y realidad |trans-title=The Foundation of Cúcuta, myth and reality|date=June 21, 2020 |website=Laopinión.com.co |publisher=Diario La Opinión |language=es}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:General Santander.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Francisco de Paula Santander|General Santander]]]]
Cúcuta was originally a [[pre-hispanic]] settlement. It was entrusted to Sebastian Lorenzo by [[Pedro de Ursúa|Pedro de Ursua]] as an [[encomienda]] in 1550. [[Juana Rangel de Cuellar]] founded Cúcuta on June 17, 1733, and donated a further {{convert|782|ha}}. The village, centred on a church, grew considerably due to its strategic commercial location, and eventually became a city.<ref>{{cite web| publisher=Norte de Santander| url=http://www.nortedesantander.gov.co/nortedesantander/home_1/htm/cont.jsp?rec=not_298.jsp| title=San José de Cúcuta| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070723005148/http://www.nortedesantander.gov.co/nortedesantander/home_1/htm/cont.jsp?rec=not_298.jsp| archive-date=July 23, 2007}}</ref>

Several important events that forged Colombia as an independent republic took place in the city: one of these events was the [[Congress of Cúcuta|Congress of 1821]], where the [[Constitution of Cúcuta]] was written and approved. This constitution created [[Greater Colombia]], a country embracing the present-day territories of [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Panama]]. The city preserves places where these historical events took place: the [[Historical Church of Cúcuta]], the [[House of Santander]], and the [[Park of Greater Colombia]].

As the site of the [[Battle of Cúcuta]] (February 28, 1813), the city was the beginning of the [[Admirable Campaign]] led by [[Simón Bolívar]]. This campaign resulted in the independence of Venezuela.

===16th century: First European incursions===

The first European in the [[North Santander]] territories was the German [[conquistador]] [[Ambrosio Alfinger]], who came from [[Santa Ana de Coro]] ([[Venezuela]]) in 1530 with a troop of adventurers, and invaded the unexplored eastern region of the newly created Governorate of Santa Marta.

Alfínger, in search of ''[[El Dorado]]'', arrived in an area of indigenous settlements called Tamalameque along the Magdalena River, fighting and defeating several tribes. Alfinger was eventually killed in the outskirts of present-day [[Chinácota]] in a battle with [[Chimila people|Chimila]] and [[Chitarero people|Chitarero]]. With Alfínger dead, Fedro St. Martin took command of the troops and returned to Coro, passing through the territory of Cúcuta.
[[File:Cúcuta - 1800.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Cúcuta. 19th Century]]
In 1541, [[Hernán Pérez de Quesada]] reached the territory of [[Chinácota]], but had to turn back the same year due to resistance by the indigenous people. Shortly thereafter, Alfonso Perez de Tolosa left [[El Tocuyo]] (Venezuela) and went to [[Salazar de Las Palmas]], through Cúcuta, but also had to turn back after losing many soldiers in clashes with the natives.

In 1549, Spanish troops, commanded by [[Pedro de Ursúa]] and Ortún Velasco, invaded [[North Santander]] and reached the valley of Pamplona. In tribute to the Spanish city of [[Pamplona]], the Spaniards founded the city of [[Pamplona, Colombia|Pamplona]]. The new town soon attracted numerous people because of its agreeable climate, and gold mines that were discovered in the region. Further expeditions left this town and completed the conquest of the current territory of [[North Santander]].

An expedition commanded by Diego de Montes founded the town of Salazar, but it was soon destroyed by the ''[[cacique]]'' Cínera. In 1583, the town was rebuilt by Alonso Esteban Rangel (great-grandfather of the founder of Cúcuta), on a site more appropriate for its defense in the event of new attacks by the natives.

The second expedition, commanded by Captain Francisco Fernández de Contreras, reached the lands of the Hacaritamas indigenous group and, on 26 July 1572, founded the [[Ocaña, Norte de Santander|city of Ocaña]], calling it "Santa Ana de Hacarí". Some of his colleagues named it New Madrid, and others Santa Ana of Ocaña. The next year, Antonio Orozco, a subaltern of Fernández, founded the town of Teorama, while the [[Augustinians|Augustinian Friars]] founded a convent in what is today the city of [[Chinácota]].

In the early 17th century a great part of the valley of Cúcuta belonged to Captain Christopher de Araque Ponce de Leon. The land passed through inheritance to his son Fernando Araque Ponce de Leon, who was the owner of the entire territory from the Valley of Cúcuta to the village of San Jose, the jurisdiction of the city of San Faustino. These fields had been donated to the older Araque by the Governor of the Province of New Mérida on 9 September 1630.

The resistance of the Motilones indigenous group towards the whites who were taking over and controlling the valley with economic ambitions was the key factor in the request for the establishment of a Catholic parish with the name "San José." [[Juana Rangel de Cuéllar]] donated {{convert|782|ha}} on June 17, 1733, for the construction of a church and land for Spanish families. Today, this area is the neighborhood of San Luis.

===19th century: Major events===

====Battle of Cúcuta====
[[File:Templo Histórico en Cúcuta.JPG|250px|thumb|left|Temple of the Congress or Historic Temple, Villa del Rosario.]]

The [[Battle of Cúcuta]] was one of the most important events of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]], due to its role in the independence of Colombia and Venezuela. This battle was the beginning of the [[Admirable Campaign]] of [[Simón Bolívar]].<ref name="Admirable Campaign">{{cite web|url=http://www.fpolar.org.ve/nosotros/historia/campadm.html|title=Admirable Campaign|publisher=Polar Foundation|access-date=February 7, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221035714/http://fpolar.org.ve/nosotros/historia/campadm.html|archive-date=February 21, 2008}}</ref> On February 28, 1813, Bolivar captured the city after a battle that lasted from 9:00&nbsp;a.m. until early afternoon. About 400 men led by Bolivar fought 800 troops led by the Spanish general Ramon Correa. Bolivar's forces reported losses of two killed and 14 injured, while the royalists are said to have suffered 20 killed and 40 injured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.simon-bolivar.org/bolivar/campana_admirable.html|title=Admirable Campaign|publisher=Simón-Bolívar.org

Colonel Simón Bolívar then launched a major offensive against the Spanish forces who were on the east bank of the Magdalena River and quickly achieved resounding victories. These led him to undertake a journey to liberate the Valley of Cúcuta held by the command of [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalist]] Colonel Ramon Correa.

====Congress of Cúcuta====
On August 30, 1821, the [[Congress of Cúcuta]] took place at the town of Villa del Rosario (today part of Cúcuta) in the church known today as the "Historic Temple of Cúcuta". The congress was established by Antonio Nariño and its participants included [[Francisco de Paula Santander]], [[Simón Bolívar]], and other leaders of Spanish America's struggle for independence from Spain.

The main objective of this congress was to unify the territories of New Granada ([[Colombia]] and [[Panama]]) and Venezuela and thus create a huge state to be known as the Republic of Colombia ([[Gran Colombia]]). [[Ecuador]] subsequently joined Gran Colombia.

At 11&nbsp;am on October 3, 1821, Simón Bolívar entered the meeting room in the sacristy of the church. He took a seat next to the president of Congress and was sworn in as president of the fledgling Republic of Colombia.

====Earthquake of Cúcuta====

On May 18, 1875, Cúcuta was largely destroyed by the [[earthquake of Cúcuta]], also known as the "Earthquake of the Andes". The earthquake occurred at 11:15&nbsp;am; it destroyed Villa del Rosario, [[San Antonio del Tachira]] and Capacho, seriously damaged the Venezuelan settlements of [[San Cristóbal, Táchira|San Cristóbal]], La Mulata, Rubio, Michelena, La Grita and Colón (among others), and was felt in [[Bogotá]] and [[Caracas]].

====Industrial Revolution====

[[File:Estación Cúcuta - 1910.jpg|thumb|Railroad of Cúcuta – 1910]]
In the 19th century, the construction of a railroad set off an [[Industrial Revolution]] in the city. The railroad had four branches: North, East, South and West.<ref>{{cite web| publisher=Biblioteca Luis Ángel Arango| url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/exhibiciones/ferrocarriles/secciones/ferrocarril_cucuta.htm| title=Ferrocarril de Cúcuta| access-date=February 11, 2007|language=es| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608182556/http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/exhibiciones/ferrocarriles/secciones/ferrocarril_cucuta.htm| archive-date=June 8, 2017| url-status=dead}}</ref> The North branch was constructed from 1878 to 1888, and connected Cúcuta with [[Puerto Santander, Norte de Santander|Puerto Santander]] and Venezuela. Construction of the Eastern and Southern branches began in 1878; the South branch linked with [[Pamplona, Colombia]], and ended in El Diamante. The West branch was not built owing to economic problems.

=== Layout ===
[[File:Plano Cucuta antes terremoto 1863.jpg|thumb|211x211px|Topography of the old city (current center) before the earthquake. 1863.]]
Cúcuta's center, core of the city, is organized as a [[Grid plan|grid]] adopted from Spain in colonial times and reformed by [[Francisco de Paula Andrade Troconis|Francisco Andrade Troconis]] after the devastating [[1875 Cúcuta earthquake|earthquake of 1875]], with [[Santander Park]] as the guiding point. More than 300 neighborhoods form the urban network. Poorer neighborhoods are in the north, north-west and south-west, many of them squatter areas. The middle class lives mostly in the central and eastern areas.

==== Odonymy ====
Minor streets (''Calles'') run from east to west, perpendicular to the city's western hills, whose numbering increases from north to south, starting from 1st Street. 

Major streets (''avenidas''), on the other hand, run from south to north parallel to the hills, starting from Zero Avenue. Avenues west of Zero Avenue increase their numbering from east to west, while those east of Zero Avenue increase their numbering from west to east, adding the indicative "E" (from ''Este'', east) as well (for example, 1st Avenue E, 2nd Avenue E, etc.).  

== Symbols ==
===Flag===
[[File:Flag of Cúcuta.svg|alt=|thumb|194x194px|Flag of the city, including the coat of arms enforced by decree.]]
The red and black [[North Santander Department]] flag was exhibited for the first time in 1928, when the first National Olympics were held in [[Cali]]. However, the [[flag of Cúcuta]]<ref name="Simbolos de Cúcuta"/> was not legalized until Mayor Carlos A. Rangel issued Decree 106 on May 3, 1988.

The black section represents the rich resources hidden beneath the territory, as well as the potential capability of the local people, whereas the red section represents the sacrifices of the [[Spanish American wars of independence|independence]] heroes and the perseverance of the people in charge of reconstructing the city.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Decreto de la Bandera de Cúcuta (CO) – Wikisource|url=https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Decreto_de_la_Bandera_de_C%C3%BAcuta_(CO)|access-date=July 14, 2021|website=es.wikisource.org|language=es}}</ref>

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms of Cúcuta<ref name="Simbolos de Cúcuta" /> was adopted on February 3, 1958, by Decree 032, after a request by the History Academy of North Santander. The shield is a classic shape, and carries the title conferred on the city by Royal Decree of the Emperor [[Carlos IV]]: ''Very noble, valiant and loyal town of San José of Cúcuta''.

The upper part depicts the arms of the city's founder Juana Rangel of Cuéllar, who donated lands for the foundation of the city on June 17, 1733.  They are five silver and red [[fleur-de-lis]] in the shape of reels, on a golden background.
[[File:Escudo de San José de Cúcuta.svg|thumb|238x238px|Coat of arms.]]
The lower part of the shield displays the arms that the [[Congress of Cúcuta|National Congress]] adopted for [[Colombia]] by the Law of October 6, 1821, at its meeting in the [[Villa del Rosario, Norte de Santander|Villa del Rosario]]. In the center are a quiver of spears, marked with X's, and a set of bow and arrows, tied with tricolor tape. The spears represent attributes of the Roman consuls; the X is a symbol of the right of life or death; the bow and arrows are symbols of the pre-hispanic indigenous people.

The lyrics were written by Father Manuel Grillo Martínez, and the music by the master Pablo Tarazona Prada. It was chosen as the Anthem of Cúcuta by a unanimous vote in a contest held in the Theater Zulima.

== Government ==
{{Main|Government of Cúcuta}}
The current mayor of Cúcuta is [[Donamaris Ramírez-Paris Lobo]], who was elected for the 2011–2015 period. He represented the [[Green Party (Colombia)|Partido Verde]] and achieved approximately 43% of the votation or 98,588 votes.<ref>{{cite web

The city is governed by the three branches of power: the executive power, represented by the Mayor and its departments; the legislative power, represented by the City Council; and the judicial power, which is formed by the tribunals and many other organisms of control. The Mayor is elected for a 4-year period and is in charge of electing each head of the administration departments. The city council is formed by 19 representatives elected by popular vote for four years. They approve or reject each decree issued by the mayor and make or correct laws regarding the city.

As the capital of [[Norte de Santander Department]], Cúcuta houses the Department Hall and the [[City hall]] of the [[Metropolitan Area of Cúcuta]], along with the Francisco de Paula Santander Justice Palace.

The city is divided into 10 localities (''comunas''). The [[Metropolitan Area of Cúcuta]] is formed by Cúcuta (as the main city), [[Villa del Rosario, Norte de Santander|Villa del Rosario]], [[Los Patios]], [[San Cayetano, Colombia|San Cayetano]], [[El Zulia]], and [[Puerto Santander, Norte de Santander|Puerto Santander]].

Politics in Cúcuta are not defined by a single [[political movement]]. Past rivals included the [[Partido Liberal Colombiano|Colombian Liberal Party]] and the [[Colombian Conservative Party]]. Today the political landscape is shared by many political parties, none commanding majority support.

[[File:Cucutadesdebogota.jpg|thumb|Housing construction in 2010. The entire city is experiencing great development.]]

The city is notable for bilateral trade and manufacturing. Its location on the border between Colombia and Venezuela has made possible strong links with the Venezuelan city of San Cristóbal, Táchira.<ref>Comunidad Andina de Naciones:  [http://www.comunidadandina.org/documentos/docSG/Ayudamemoria14-4-05.htm Caracterización de la frontera Colombo-Venezolana] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216181857/http://www.comunidadandina.org/documentos/docSG/Ayudamemoria14-4-05.htm |date=December 16, 2007 }}.

The most developed [[Industry (economics)|industries]] are dairy, construction, textiles, [[shoes]], and leather. The city is a top producer of cement and its [[clay]] and [[stoneware]] industry has the best reputation nationally for its high quality. The mining of coal also plays an important role in the local economy. The [[University Francisco de Paula Santander]] in Cucuta, the [[National University of Colombia]] in Bogotá, and the Pedagogical and Technological University of Colombia in Tunja are the only ones in the country that provide for the career of [[Mining Engineering]].

The [[Colombian peso|peso]] is the official and sole legal tender currency in the city. Owing to its proximity to [[Venezuela]], the [[Venezuelan bolívar|bolívar]] was accepted by the vast majority of commercial establishments until the rapid devaluation of the Venezuelan currency began after the [[Crisis in Venezuela|2013 recession]].

===US–Colombia Free Trade Agreement, implications for Cúcuta===

Colombia signed a [[Free trade area|Free Trade Agreement]] with the United States against opposition by Venezuela. Despite this opposition, industries from Venezuela are constructing their infrastructure in Cúcuta to export their products to the United States, registering their products as if they were Colombian, a strategy that allows them to export without paying certain tariffs. For that reason, Cúcuta is expected to become an industrial city.<ref>{{cite web

Colombian law provides tax exemptions for Venezuelan imports through the ''Zona Franca'', which, coupled with the motorway links between Cúcuta and [[Maracaibo]], increases the possibility of exports from Maracaibo into Colombia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.andi.com.co/camaras/zonasfrancas/default.htm |author=ANDI |title=Zona Franca |access-date=October 15, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030820123833/http://www.andi.com.co/camaras/zonasfrancas/default.htm |archive-date=August 20, 2003 |language=es}}</ref>

==Telecommunications==
The city's telecommunications services include [[payphone]]s, [[WiMAX]] wireless networks,<ref>{{cite news|last=Peña|first=Javier|title=Masificarán Internet Inalámbrico en Cúcuta|language=es|publisher=CucutaNuestra.com|date=October 27, 2006|url=http://www.cucutanuestra.com/?module=news&file=news&news=3133|access-date=February 19, 2007}}</ref> and mobile phone networks ([[GSM]], [[CDMA]], and [[Digital AMPS|TDMA]]).

[[Telecom Colombia]] offers the services of local, national, and international telephone and broadband [[ADSL]] Internet.  There are three mobile telephone operators: [[Comcel Colombia|Comcel]], [[Movistar]], and [[Tigo]].

== Transport ==
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Mapa cucuta.PNG|thumb|Map of Cúcuta]] -->
For travel outside the city, there is a bus station called "Terminal de Transportes" (to be replaced by a new one), the [[Camilo Daza International Airport]] (Colombia) and the [[Juan Vicente Gómez International Airport]] (Venezuela).

===Greenery===
Cúcuta has more green zones than many cities in Colombia. Some consider the city an ''urban lung'', due to its greenery and lack of pollution. Cucuteños, and the legion of foreigners who reconstructed the city after the 1875 earthquake, led by engineer Francisco de Paula Andrade Troconis, led to the development of greenery in the city. The first planted trees were clemones. Soon they were replaced by [[acacia]]s, peracos, and [[almond]] trees that adorned the parks and roadsides.  An example of this city design is the Avenue of the Lights (based on oití, [[ficus]], and cují), that forms a natural tunnel admired in the rest of the country and by tourists.

[[Arecaceae|Palm trees]] are common in places such as Santander Park, [[Great Colombian Park]], the [[Bank of the Republic]], and the Department Hall of [[Norte de Santander]].
