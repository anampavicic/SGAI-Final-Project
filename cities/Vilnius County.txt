'''Vilnius County''' ({{lang-lt|Vilniaus apskritis}}) is the largest of the 10 [[counties of Lithuania]], located in the east of the country around the [[city]] [[Vilnius]] and is also known as '''Capital Region''' or '''Sostinės regionas''' by the [[State Data Agency|Lithuanian statistics department]] and [[Eurostat]]. On 1 July 2010, the county administration was abolished,<ref>{{cite web|title=Dėl apskričių viršininkų administracijų likvidavimo|url=http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter3/dokpaieska.showdoc_l?p_id=392936|publisher=Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania|access-date=21 August 2011}}</ref> and since that date, Vilnius County remains as the territorial and statistical unit.

Until the [[Partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in late 18th century the area belonged to the [[Vilnius Voivodship]] and [[Trakai Voivodship]] of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. In the [[Russian Empire]] it belonged to the [[Northwestern Krai]] and approximately corresponded to its [[Vilna Governorate]] (as of 1843). During [[World War I]], following the German offensive of 1915, it was occupied by the [[Germany|German]] army. After the war, some parts of the area was ruled by local [[Poland|Polish]] self-government established after the German [[Ober-Ost]] army withdrew from the area.

Following the start of the [[Polish-Bolshevik War]] in 1919, it was occupied by the [[Red Army]], which was pushed back by the [[Polish Army]]. In 1920, it was again occupied by the Red Army, but the Soviets officially recognized the sovereignty of the [[Lithuania|Lithuanian Republic]] over the city immediately after defeat during [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]]. During their retreat, the Bolsheviks passed the sovereignty over the area to Lithuania. The Polish commander [[Józef Piłsudski]] ordered his subordinate general [[Lucjan Żeligowski]] to "rebel" his Lithuanian-[[Belarus]]ian division and capture the city of [[Vilnius]], without declaring war on Lithuania. The area of the future Vilnius County was seized by the Polish forces without significant opposition from Lithuanian forces and Gen. Żeligowski created a short-lived state called the [[Republic of Central Lithuania]]. Following the elections held there in 1922 the state was incorporated into Poland (see [[Vilnius region]], [[Republic of Central Lithuania|Central Lithuania]]).

As a result of the [[Nazi-Soviet Alliance]] and the [[Invasion of Poland|Polish Defensive War]] of 1939, the area was captured by the [[Soviet Union]], which transferred parts of what is now ''Vilnius County'' and [[Utena County]] to [[Lithuania]], only to annex it the following year. In 1941, it was conquered by the [[Nazism|Nazi Germany]]. During [[World War II]], the area saw formation of many resistance units, most notably the Polish [[Home Army]] and, after 1943, [[Soviet partisans]]. After the war, Vilniaus Apskritis existed as a relic of the pre-war independent state in [[Lithuanian SSR]] between 1944 and 1950. In this period, a significant part of its population moved to [[Poland]] during the so-called [[repatriation]].

After 1990, when Lithuania became independent, Vilnius county was re-established differently in 1994. This entity has different boundaries than any previous entity and is not directly related to previous entities in this area. The mission of the county is different as well: its primary goal (as in that of Lithuania's other counties) is to oversee that municipalities in its area follow the laws of Lithuania.

==Municipalities==
The county is subdivided into six district municipalities, one municipality and one city municipality:
