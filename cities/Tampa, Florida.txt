'''Tampa''' ({{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|t|æ|m|p|ə}} {{Respell|TAM|pə}}) is a city on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] of the U.S. state of [[Florida]]. Tampa's borders include the north shore of [[Tampa Bay]] and the east shore of Old Tampa Bay. Tampa is the largest city in the [[Tampa Bay area]] and the [[county seat]] of [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]]. With an estimated population of 403,364 in 2023, Tampa is the [[List of United States cities by population|49th-most populous city in the country]] and the [[List of municipalities in Florida|third-most populous city in Florida]] after [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] and [[Miami]].

Tampa was founded as a military center in the 19th century, with the establishment of [[Fort Brooke]]. The cigar industry was  brought to Tampa by [[Vicente Martinez Ybor|Vincente Martinez Ybor]], after whom [[Ybor City]] is named. Tampa was reincorporated as a city in 1887 following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Tampa's economy is driven by tourism, health care, finance, insurance, technology, construction, and the maritime industry.<ref>{{cite web |title=Development and Economic Opportunity |url=https://www.tampa.gov/DEO |access-date=May 2, 2021 |website=City of Tampa |date=July 7, 2014 |language=en |archive-date=May 2, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210502101738/https://www.tampa.gov/DEO |url-status=live }}</ref> The bay's [[Port Tampa Bay|port]] is the largest in the state, responsible for over $15 billion in economic impact.<ref>{{cite web |title=Port of Tampa Bay Official Information |url=https://www.porttb.com/home |access-date=May 2, 2021 |website=Port Tampa Bay |language=en |archive-date=May 2, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210502102743/https://www.porttb.com/home |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Etymology==
The earliest instance of the name "Tampa", in the form "Tanpa", appears in the memoirs of [[Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda]], who spent 17 years as a captive of the [[Calusa]] and traveled through much of peninsular Florida. He described Tanpa as an important Calusa town to the north of the Calusa domain, possibly under another chief. [[Archaeologist]] Jerald Milanich places the town of Tanpa at the mouth of [[Charlotte Harbor (estuary)|Charlotte Harbor]]. The entrances to Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor are obscured by [[barrier island]]s, and their locations, and the names applied to them, were a source of confusion to explorers, surveyors and map-makers from the 16th century to the 18th century. ''Bahía Tampa'' and ''Bahía de Espíritu Santo'' were each used, at one time or another, for the modern Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor.<ref name="Milanich 1995 40">{{cite book |title=Florida Indians and the Invasion from Europe |last=Milanich |first=Jerald T. |publisher=University Press of Florida. |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-8130-1360-2 |location=Gainesville, Florida |page=40}}</ref><ref name=simpson>{{Cite book |title=Florida Place-Names of Indian Derivation |last=Simpson |first=J.

Tampa Bay was labeled ''Bahía de Espíritu Santo'' (Bay of the Holy Spirit) in the earliest Spanish maps of Florida. It became known as B. Tampa (''Bahía Tampa'' or Tampa Bay) as early as 1576.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.libs.uga.edu/darchive/hargrett/maps/1695c6.jpg |title=University of Georgia Libraries, Hargrett Rare Books and Manuscript Library: 1695 Spanish Map |access-date=April 27, 2009 |archive-date=June 24, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624152536/http://www.libs.uga.edu/darchive/hargrett/maps/1695c6.jpg |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>See Juan Lopez de Velasco manuscript map of the West Indies, ca. 1576.

A 1705 British map also shows B. Tampa, with "Carlos Bay" for Charlotte Harbor to the south. A 1748 British map had "B. del Spirito Santo" for Tampa Bay and "Carlos Bay" to the south. A Spanish map of 1757 renamed Tampa Bay as "San Fernando". As late as 1774, [[Bernard Romans]] called Tampa Bay "Bay of Espiritu Santo", with "Tampa Bay" restricted to the Northwest arm, what is now Old Tampa Bay, and the northeast arm named "Hillsborough Bay". The name may have come from the Calusa language or possibly, the [[Timucua language]]. Some scholars have compared "Tampa" to "itimpi", which means "close to" or "nearby" in the [[Muscogee language|Creek language]], but its meaning is not known.<ref name=simpson/>

In 1849, when the pioneer community living near the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] outpost of [[Fort Brooke]] was incorporated, it was called "Tampa Town". In 1855, the name was shortened to simply "Tampa".<ref name="Milanich 1995 40"/><ref name=simpson/>

People from Tampa are generally known as "Tampans", "Tampanians", or "Tampeños".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Guzzo |first1=Paul |title=In the debate over what to call people from Tampa, the Tampeños have spoken |url=https://www.tampabay.com/florida/2019/01/14/in-the-debate-over-what-to-call-people-from-tampa-the-tampenos-have-spoken/ |access-date=January 26, 2022 |work=Tampa Bay Times |publisher=Tampa Publishing Company |date=January 14, 2019 |archive-date=January 26, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220126085131/https://www.tampabay.com/florida/2019/01/14/in-the-debate-over-what-to-call-people-from-tampa-the-tampenos-have-spoken/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2014, local authorities consulted by Michael Kruse of the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'' suggest that "Tampan" was historically more common, while "Tampanian" became popular when the former term came to be seen as a potential insult.<ref name=Kruse>{{cite news |last=Kruse |first=Michael |title=What are you called if you live in Tampa? |url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/timesnews/content/what-are-you-called-if-you-live-tampa |newspaper=Tampa Bay Times |access-date=April 26, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426215213/http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/timesnews/content/what-are-you-called-if-you-live-tampa |archive-date=April 26, 2014}}</ref> A mix of Cuban, Italian, and Spanish immigrants began arriving in the late 1800s to found and work in the new communities of [[Ybor City]] and [[West Tampa]].

===Indigenous peoples and European exploration===
{{main|Tocobaga|Pohoy}}

The shores of [[Tampa Bay]] have been inhabited for thousands of years. A variant of the [[Weeden Island culture]] developed in the area by about 2,000 years ago. Archeological evidence suggests that these residents relied on the sea for most of their resources, as a vast majority of inhabited sites have been found on or near the shoreline, with little evidence of farming. At the time of European contact in the early 16th century, several chiefdoms of the [[Safety Harbor culture]] dominated the area.<ref name="milanich1998">{{cite book |last1=Milanich |first1=Jerald T. |title=Florida's Indians from Ancient Times to the Present |date=1998 |publisher=University Press of Florida |location=Gainesville |isbn=0-8130-1599-5}}</ref>

Early Spanish explorers interacted most extensively with the [[Tocobaga]], whose principal town was at the northern end of Old Tampa Bay near today's [[Safety Harbor, Florida|Safety Harbor]] in [[Pinellas County]]. While there is a substantial historical record of the Tocobaga, and the [[Calusa]], who lived to the south, there is less surviving documentation describing the [[Pohoy]], who lived near the mouth of the Hillsborough River near today's downtown Tampa. Evidence suggests that the language and culture of the Pohoy and other lesser-known groups around the bay were very similar to that of the Tocobaga.<ref>Milanich, Jerald T. 1995.

Expeditions led by [[Narváez expedition|Pánfilo de Narváez]] and [[Hernando de Soto]] landed near Tampa, but neither [[conquistador]] stayed long. There is no natural gold or silver in Florida, and the native inhabitants repulsed Spanish attempts to establish a permanent settlement or convert them to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]. The fighting resulted in a few deaths, but the many more deaths were caused by infectious diseases brought from Europe, which devastated the population of Native Americans across Florida and the entire Western Hemisphere. The indigenous cultures of the Tampa Bay area collapsed by around 1600, leaving the west coast of [[Spanish Florida]] largely depopulated and ignored for more than 200 years.<ref name="Mulder, Kenneth 1990">Mulder, Kenneth.

In the mid-18th century, events in the American colonies and the early United States drove the [[Seminole]] people into northern Florida.

Before the American period, the Tampa Bay area had a handful of residents: [[Cubans|Cuban]] and Native American fishermen who established small seasonal camps called "ranchos" on the shores of Tampa Bay. The largest was at the mouth of Spanishtown Creek in today's [[Hyde Park (Tampa)|Hyde Park]] neighborhood along [[Bayshore Boulevard]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kite-Powell |first1=Rodney |title=Tampa and Cuba connected through time |url=http://www.tbo.com/health-lifestyles/tampa-and-cuba-connected-through-time-20160410/ |access-date=May 9, 2018 |work=The Tampa Tribune |date=April 10, 2016 |archive-date=May 9, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509150916/http://www.tbo.com/health-lifestyles/tampa-and-cuba-connected-through-time-20160410/ |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Tampa was initially an isolated frontier outpost. The sparse civilian population practically abandoned the area during the [[Second Seminole War]] from 1835 to 1842, after which the Seminoles were forced out and many settlers returned.<ref>Brown, Cantor. ''Tampa Before the Civil War''. [[University Press of Florida]].</ref>

[[Territory of Florida|Florida]] became the 27th state on March 3, 1845. On January 18, 1849, Tampa was officially incorporated as the "Village of Tampa." It was home to 185 civilians, or 974 total residents including military personnel, in 1850.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.city-travel-guide.co.uk/travel-guide/tampa-florida-travel-guide.html |title=Tampa travel guide&nbsp;– Tampa tourism and travel information |publisher=City-travel-guide.co.uk |access-date=February 23, 2010 |archive-date=August 30, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830053628/http://www.city-travel-guide.co.uk/travel-guide/tampa-florida-travel-guide.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1850c-11.pdf |title=1850 Census of Population |access-date=April 17, 2011 |archive-date=October 26, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026062601/http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1850c-11.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> Tampa was reincorporated as a town on December 15, 1855.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tampagov.net/dept_City_Clerk/Information_resources/previous_mayors/joseph_lancaster.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615171102/http://www.tampagov.net/dept_City_Clerk/Information_resources/previous_mayors/joseph_lancaster.asp |archive-date=June 15, 2008 |title=Joseph B.

===Civil War and Reconstruction===

{{Main|Florida in the American Civil War}}

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Florida seceded along with most of the southern states to form the [[Confederate States of America]], and Fort Brooke was defended by Confederate troops. [[Martial law]] was declared in Tampa in January 1862, and Tampa's city government ceased to operate for the duration of the war.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tampagov.net/dept_City_Clerk/Information_resources/previous_mayors/No_Municipal_Form_of_Government.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070923073552/http://www.tampagov.net/dept_City_Clerk/Information_resources/previous_mayors/No_Municipal_Form_of_Government.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 23, 2007 |title=Military Rule of Tampa During Civil War |publisher=tampagov.net |access-date=February 23, 2008}}</ref>

In 1861, the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] Navy set up a [[blockade]] around many southern ports to cut off the Confederacy. Several US Navy ships were stationed near the mouth of [[Tampa Bay]], but small [[blockade runners|blockade running ships]] were often able to slip by the blockade to deliver cattle to Spanish Cuba, earning gold for the Confederate cause.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tampagov.net/dept_City_Clerk/Information_resources/previous_mayors/james_mckaysr.asp |title=James McKay, Sr.&nbsp;– 6th Mayor of Tampa |publisher=tampagov.net |access-date=February 24, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615171041/http://www.tampagov.net/dept_City_Clerk/Information_resources/previous_mayors/james_mckaysr.asp |archive-date=June 15, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://americancivilwar.com/statepic/fl/fl002.html |title=Florida Civil War Battle Tampa Bay American War Between the States |publisher=americancivilwar.com |access-date=February 24, 2008 |archive-date=April 25, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425075041/http://americancivilwar.com/statepic/fl/fl002.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/fl002.htm |title=Battle Summary: Tampa, FL |publisher=nps.gov |access-date=February 24, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218024028/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/fl002.htm |archive-date=February 18, 2008}}</ref> On June 30, 1862, the gunboat [[USS Sagamore (1861)|USS ''Sagamore'']] sailed into [[Tampa Bay]] and opened fire on Fort Brooke, which returned fire. The ''Sagamore'' withdrew after a few hours, and the [[Battle of Tampa]] caused little damage. During the [[Battle of Fort Brooke]] on October 16 and the [[Battle of Ballast Point]] on October 18, 1863, Union forces inflicted serious damage to Tampa's economy when, under the cover of another bombardment of the fort, troops landed and destroyed two blockade running ships that had been hidden upstream along the Hillsborough River.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tampabay.com/news/article516881.ece |title=Hull of Civil War sloop likely found in Tampa river&nbsp;– St. Petersburg Times |work=Tampa Bay Times |access-date=February 23, 2010 |archive-date=February 2, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202153138/http://tampabay.com/news/article516881.ece |url-status=live }}</ref>

In May 1864, Union troops landed again and took Fort Brooke largely unopposed. They destroyed much of the fort's facilities and confiscated the remaining military supplies other than the cannons, which they tossed into the Hillsborough River, then left the "desolate" town after two days.<ref name="attack">{{cite news |last1=Morelli |first1=Keith |title=Tuesday marks anniversary of Union attack on Tampa |url=https://www.tbo.com/news/florida/tuesday-marks-anniversary-of-union-attack-on-tampa-20140504/ |access-date=August 3, 2018 |work=The Tampa Tribune |date=May 4, 2014 |archive-date=August 3, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180803133915/https://www.tbo.com/news/florida/tuesday-marks-anniversary-of-union-attack-on-tampa-20140504/ |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Civil War ended]] in April 1865 with a Confederate defeat. In May 1865, federal troops arrived in Tampa to occupy the fort and the town as part of [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]]. They remained until August 1869.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

During the immediate post-war period, Tampa was a poor, isolated fishing village with about 1,000 residents and little industry. [[Yellow fever]], borne by mosquitoes from nearby swamps, broke out several times during the 1860s and 1870s, causing more residents to leave.<ref>Brown, Cantor. ''Tampa During the Civil War and Reconstruction''. [[University Press of Florida]].</ref> In 1869, residents voted to abolish the city of Tampa government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tampagov.net/dept_City_Clerk/Information_resources/archives/City_of_Tampa_Incorporation_History.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824182934/http://www.tampagov.net/dept_City_Clerk/Information_resources/archives/City_of_Tampa_Incorporation_History.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 24, 2007 |title=Archives, City of Tampa Incorporation History |publisher=tampagov.net |access-date=February 23, 2008}}</ref>

In 1870, the population of "Tampa Town" was about 800, and dropped to about 700 by 1880. Fort Brooke was decommissioned in 1883, further impacting the local economy in the short run, but opening up the waterfront for development. Except for two [[cannon]]s displayed on the [[University of Tampa]] campus, all traces of the fort are gone.<ref name="attack"/>

===1880s economic prosperity===
[[File:Port Tampa Inn.jpg|right|thumb|Port Tampa Inn, with rail line in front of hotel, c. 1900]]

In the mid-1880s, Tampa's fortunes took several sudden turns for the better. In 1883, [[phosphate]] was discovered in the [[Bone Valley]] region southeast of Tampa. The mineral, vital for the production of [[fertilizer]]s and other products, was soon being shipped from the Port of Tampa in great volume. Tampa is still a major phosphate exporter.

The discovery of phosphate, the arrival of Plant's railroad, and the founding of Ybor City and West Tampa—all in the mid-1880s—were crucial to Tampa's development. The once-struggling village of Tampa became a bustling [[boomtown]] almost overnight and had grown into one of the largest cities in Florida by 1900.<ref name="Lastra, Frank 2006"/>

====Plant's railroad====
In late 1883, [[Henry B. Plant]]'s narrow-gauge [[South Florida Railroad]] reached Tampa and its port, connecting the small town to the nation's railroad system after years of efforts by local leaders. Previously, Tampa's overland transportation links had consisted of sandy roads stretching across the Florida countryside. Plant's railroad made it much easier to get goods in and out of the Tampa Bay area. Phosphate and [[commercial fishing]] exports could be sent north by rail,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baysoundings.com/sum05/phosphate4.html |title=About Bone Valley |publisher=Baysoundings.com |access-date=April 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707214707/http://www.baysoundings.com/sum05/phosphate4.html |archive-date=July 7, 2011}}</ref> and many new products were brought into the Tampa market, along with the first tourists.
[[File:Yborcigarfactory.jpg|thumb|[[Vicente Martinez Ybor|Ybor's]] first cigar factory 1916]]

====Ybor's cigars====
{{See also|History of Ybor City}}
[[File:Lewis Hine, Cigarmakers, Tampa, Florida, 1909.jpg|thumb|Rolling cigars, 1909. Photo by [[Lewis Hine]].]]

The new railroad link enabled another important industry to come to Tampa. In 1885, the Tampa Board of Trade enticed [[Vicente Martinez Ybor]] to move his [[cigar]] manufacturing operations to Tampa from [[Key West, Florida|Key West]]. Proximity to [[Cuba]] made importation of "clear Havana tobacco" easy by sea, and Plant's railroad made shipment of finished cigars to the rest of the US market easy by land.<ref name="Lastra, Frank 2006">Lastra, Frank. ''Ybor City: The Making of a Landmark Town''. 2006. University of Tampa Press.</ref>

Since Tampa was still a small town at the time, with a population less than 5,000, Ybor built hundreds of small houses around his factory to accommodate the immediate influx of mainly Cuban and Spanish cigar workers. [[Ybor City]]'s factories rolled their first cigars in 1886, and many different cigar manufacturers moved their operations to town in ensuing years. Many [[Italians|Italian]] and a few Eastern European [[Jews|Jewish]] immigrants arrived starting in the late 1880s, opening businesses and shops that catered to cigar workers.<ref name="ReferenceB">Mormino, Gary. ''The Immigrant World of Ybor City''. [[University Press of Florida]]</ref>

By 1900, over 10,000 immigrants had moved to the neighborhood. Several thousand more Cuban immigrants built [[West Tampa]], another cigar-centric suburb founded a few years later by Hugh MacFarlane. Between them, two "Latin" communities combined to exponentially expand Tampa's population, economic base, and tax revenues, as Tampa became the "Cigar Capital of the World".<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

===Early 20th century===
During the first few decades of the 20th century, the cigar-making industry was the backbone of Tampa's economy. The factories in Ybor City and West Tampa made an enormous number of cigars—in the peak year of 1929, over 500 million cigars were hand rolled in Tampa.<ref>Lastra, Frank, ''Ybor City: The Making of a Landmark Town''</ref>

In 1904, a civic association of local businessmen dubbed themselves [[Ye Mystic Krewe|Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla]], named after local mythical pirate José Gaspar, and staged an "invasion" of the city followed by a parade. With a few exceptions, the [[Gasparilla Pirate Festival]] has been held every year since.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gasparillapiratefest.com |title=Gasparilla Pirate Festival&nbsp;– Tampa, Florida |publisher=Gasparillapiratefest.com |access-date=February 23, 2010 |archive-date=February 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225142224/http://www.gasparillapiratefest.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Bolita and organized crime===
[[File:Downtowntampa1913.jpg|center|thumb|853x853px|A 1913 panorama of downtown Tampa]]

Beginning in the late 19th century, illegal [[bolita]] lotteries were very popular among the Tampa working classes, especially in Ybor City. In the early 1920s, this small-time operation was taken over by [[Charlie Wall]], the rebellious son of a prominent Tampa family, and went big-time. Bolita was able to openly thrive only because of [[Kickback (bribery)|kick-backs]] and bribes to key local politicians and law enforcement officials, and many were on the take.<ref name="ReferenceA">Kerstein, Robert. ''Politics and Growth in 20th Century Tampa''. University Press of Florida. {{ISBN|0-8130-2083-2}}.</ref>

Profits from the bolita lotteries and [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]-era bootlegging led to the development of several [[organized crime]] factions in Tampa. Charlie Wall was the first major boss, but various power struggles culminated in consolidation of control by [[Sicily|Sicilian]] [[made man|mafioso]] [[Santo Trafficante Sr.]] and his faction in the 1950s. After his death in 1954 from cancer, control passed to his son, [[Santo Trafficante Jr.]], who established alliances with families in New York City and extended his power throughout Florida and into [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]]-era [[Cuba]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Deitche |first=Scott |url=http://www.weeklyplanet.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A317 |title=The Mob |publisher=Weeklyplanet.com |access-date=April 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060315022914/http://www.weeklyplanet.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A317 |archive-date=March 15, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanmafia.com/Feature_Articles_101.html |title=Feature Articles 101 |publisher=AmericanMafia.com |access-date=April 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206141849/http://www.americanmafia.com/Feature_Articles_101.html |archive-date=February 6, 2010}}</ref>

The era of rampant and open corruption ended in the 1950s, when [[Estes Kefauver]]'s traveling [[Kefauver hearings|organized crime hearings]] came to town and were followed by the sensational misconduct trials of several local officials. Although many of the worst offenders in government and the mob were not charged, the trials helped to end the sense of lawlessness which had prevailed in Tampa for decades.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Mid to late 20th century===
[[File:Macdill-worldwarII.jpg|thumb|[[MacDill Air Force Base]] during World War II]]

Tampa grew considerably as a result of [[World War II]]. Prior to the United States' involvement in the conflict, construction began on [[MacDill Air Force Base|MacDill Field]], which served as a main base for [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] and later [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] operations just before and during World War II, with multiple auxiliary airfields around the Tampa Bay area and surrounding counties. At the end of the war, MacDill remained as an active military installation, while the auxiliary fields reverted to civilian control. Two of these auxiliary fields later became the present-day [[Tampa International Airport]] and [[St. Petersburg–Clearwater International Airport]]. With the establishment of an independent [[U.S. Air Force]] in 1947, MacDill Field became [[MacDill Air Force Base]].

In the 1950s and 1960s, Tampa had record-setting population growth that has not been seen since. This growth spurred expansion of Tampa's highways and bridges, bringing thousands into the city and creating opportunities for Tampa business owners, who welcomed the influx of tourists and new residents. It was during this time period in Tampa's history that two of the most popular tourist attractions in the area were developed&nbsp;– [[Busch Gardens]] and [[Lowry Park Zoo|Lowry Park]]. Many of the well-known institutions that play an important role in the economic development of Tampa were established during this time period.<ref name="arcadiapublishing.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.arcadiapublishing.com |title=Vintage Tampa Signs and Scenes |access-date=March 23, 2018 |archive-date=April 20, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420011135/https://www.arcadiapublishing.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[University of South Florida]] was established in North Tampa in 1956 and opened for students in September 1960.<ref>{{cite web |title=USF History |url=http://www.usf.edu/about-usf/history.aspx |work=usf.edu |publisher=University of South Florida |access-date=August 16, 2015 |archive-date=August 21, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821053340/http://www.usf.edu/about-usf/history.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref> The school spurred the construction of several residential and commercial developments in the previously agriculture-dominated area around the new campus. Overall, Tampa continued to expand away from the city center during the 1960s as new hospitals, schools, churches and subdivisions all began appearing to accommodate the growth. Many business offices began moving away from the traditional downtown office building into more convenient neighborhood office plazas.<ref name="arcadiapublishing.com"/>

In 1970, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Tampa's population as being 80.0% white and 19.7% black.<ref>{{cite web |title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archive-date=August 12, 2012}}</ref>

Four attempts have been made to [[Consolidated city-county|consolidate]] the municipal government of the city of Tampa with the county government of Hillsborough County, in 1967, 1970, 1971, and 1972, all of which failed at the ballot box.

The [[Hillsborough River (Florida)|Hillsborough River]] flows into Hillsborough Bay, passing directly in front of [[Downtown Tampa]] and supplying Tampa's main source of fresh water. The [[Palm River]] is a smaller river, flowing from just east of the city into [[McKay Bay]], which is a smaller inlet, sited at the northeast end of Hillsborough Bay.<ref name="Palm River Restoration"/> Tampa's geography is marked by the Interbay Peninsula, which divides Hillsborough Bay in the east, from Old Tampa Bay in the west.

The design for the renovated [[Tampa Museum of Art]] displays post-modern architecture, while the city hall and the [[Tampa Theatre]] belong to [[Art Deco]] architecture.

The Tampa mayor [[Pam Iorio]] made the redevelopment of [[Downtown Tampa|Tampa's downtown]], especially residential development, a priority.<ref>{{cite web |title=Floridian: Urban culture clash |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/08/10/Floridian/Urban_culture_clash.shtml |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523003715/http://www.sptimes.com/2003/08/10/Floridian/Urban_culture_clash.shtml |archive-date=May 23, 2011 |access-date=April 17, 2011 |work=St Petersburg Times}}</ref> Several residential and mixed-development high-rises have been constructed.

===Climate===
The Tampa Bay area has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), although due to its location on the Florida peninsula on Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, it shows some characteristics of a tropical climate. Tampa has hot and humid summers with frequent [[thunderstorm]]s and dry and mild winters. Average highs range from {{cvt|71|to|91|F|C|0}} year round, and lows {{cvt|53|to|77|F|C|0}}. The city of Tampa is split between two [[USDA]] climate zones. In the 2012 [[USDA]] Plant Hardiness Zone Map, Tampa is listed as [[USDA]] zone 9b north of Kennedy Boulevard away from the bay and 10a near the shorelines and in the interbay peninsula south of Kennedy Boulevard. Zone 10a is about the northern limit of where [[coconut palm]]s and [[royal palm]]s can be grown, although some specimens do grow in northern Tampa. Recently, certain palm tree species in the area, along with the rest of the state, have been and continue to be severely affected by a plant disease called [[Texas phoenix palm decline]], which has caused a considerable amount of damage to various local palm tree landscapes and threatens the native palm tree species in the region.<ref>Harrison, Nigel A.; Elliot, Monica L. (June 2013) [2007]. Texas Phoenix Palm Decline (PDF) (Report). Plant Pathology Department, UF/IFAS Extension, University of Florida.</ref>

===Tropical storms===
Though threatened by tropical systems almost every hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30, Tampa has seldom felt major effects from [[tropical storm]]s or [[hurricane]]s. No hurricane has made [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in the immediate Tampa Bay area since the category 4 [[1921 Tampa Bay hurricane]] made landfall near [[Tarpon Springs, Florida|Tarpon Springs]] and caused extensive damage throughout the region.<ref name="comingstorm" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/weather/hurricanes/the-tampa-bay-area-has-been-lucky/1096585 |title=The Tampa Bay area has been lucky |date=May 21, 2010 |access-date=October 24, 2016 |website=Tampa Bay Times |last=McClure |first=Brian |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025050824/http://www.tampabay.com/news/weather/hurricanes/the-tampa-bay-area-has-been-lucky/1096585 |archive-date=October 25, 2016}}</ref>

Over the past few decades, four major hurricanes were forecast to hit the Tampa Bay area from the south-southwest, which is a worse-case track that would result in a maximum [[storm surge]] event: [[Hurricane Donna]] (1960), [[Hurricane Charley]] (2004), [[Hurricane Irma]] (2017), and [[Hurricane Ian]] (2022).<ref name="pineapple1998">{{cite book |last=Henry |first=James |title=The Climate and Weather of Florida |publisher=Pineapple Press (FL) |location=Sarasota, Florida |year=1998 |isbn=978-1-56164-036-2}}</ref><ref name="Ian2022">{{cite news |last1=Wilson |first1=Kirby |title=Hurricane Ian was supposed to slam Tampa Bay head on.

Irma had the greatest effect on Tampa. It made landfall near [[Marco Island]] on September 10, 2017, and moved due north, passing through eastern Hillsborough County as a Category 1 storm and causing widespread issues in the area, particularly disrupting the [[electrical grid]] for several days.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.tampabay.com/news/weather/hurricanes/power-update-19-million-customers-in-florida-still-powerless-five-days/2337576/ |title=19 Million Customers in Florida Still Powerless |last=Sampson |first=Zachary |date=September 15, 2017 |work=Tampa Bay Times |access-date=September 16, 2017 |archive-date=September 17, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917025542/http://www.tampabay.com/news/weather/hurricanes/power-update-19-million-customers-in-florida-still-powerless-five-days/2337576 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Because of tremendous population growth and coastal development in the century since the last hurricane landfall, combined with rising sea levels due to [[climate change]], the Tampa Bay Area is considered one of the most vulnerable regions in the world to a direct hit from a major storm.<ref name="comingstorm">{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/health/environment/tampa-bay-climate-change/ |title=Tampa Bay's Coming Storm |last=Fears |first=Darryl |date=July 28, 2017 |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=September 16, 2017 |archive-date=September 11, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911184601/https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/health/environment/tampa-bay-climate-change/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Seasonal trends===

====Summer====
Summertime weather patterns predominate from late May to early October, which is the region's rainy season.<ref name="rainyseason">{{cite news |last1=Fiallo |first1=Josh |title=Rainy season is coming, Tampa Bay.

Mainly due to the proximity of large bodies of water, the official high temperature has never hit {{cvt|100|°F|1}}&nbsp;– the all-time record high temperature is {{cvt|99|°F|0}}, first recorded on June 5, 1985, and tied on June 26, 2020.<ref name=NOAA>{{cite web |url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=tbw |title=NowData - NOAA Online Weather Data |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |accessdate=April 11, 2016 |archive-date=September 17, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917052629/http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=tbw |url-status=live }}</ref>

Afternoon thunderstorms are regularly generated by the interaction of the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf]] and [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] [[sea breeze]]s and are such a regular occurrence during the summer that the Tampa Bay area and nearby inland areas of [[Central Florida]] are recognized as the "Lightning Capital of North America". Afternoon thundershowers occasionally intensify into a [[Severe thunderstorm watch|severe thunderstorm]], bringing heavy downpours, frequent lightning, strong straight-line winds, and sometimes hail.<ref name=TWC >{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/outlook/recreation/outdoors/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USFL0481?from=search |title=Average Weather for Tampa, FL&nbsp;– Temperature and Precipitation |publisher=weather.com |access-date=February 23, 2008 |archive-date=March 9, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309093310/http://www.weather.com/outlook/recreation/outdoors/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USFL0481?from=search |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Autumn====
Average temperatures gradually fall beginning in September, and average daily rainfall amounts decrease as autumn progresses. November is usually Tampa's driest month. However, rain totals in the fall can be augmented by passing tropical systems, which can dump several inches of rain.

====Winter====
Winter in the area is generally dry and cooler. Average high temperatures range from the low to mid-70s&nbsp;°F (21–23&nbsp;°C) during the day to the low to mid-50s&nbsp;°F (11–13&nbsp;°C) at night. Occasional [[cold front]]s push through the area during the season, usually bringing a brief period of rain followed by daytime highs in the 50s&nbsp;°F (10–13&nbsp;°C) and nighttime lows near 40&nbsp;°F (5&nbsp;°C) for a day or two. Tampa experiences occasional frosts, with an annual mean minimum temperature of {{cvt|32.8|F}}

Since the Tampa area is home to a diverse range of freeze-sensitive agriculture and [[aquaculture]], hard freezes, although quite rare, are a major concern. Hard freezes, defined as a temperature of {{cvt|28|°F|1}} or below for several hours, occur rarely in the Tampa area, every five to twenty years depending on the exact location. The last widespread freeze occurred on the morning [[2017–18 North American cold wave|of January 18, 2018]], when the official temperature at Tampa International Airport dropped to {{cvt|29|°F|°C}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://w1.weather.gov/data/obhistory/KTPA.html |title=Tampa Bay Area National Weather Service Climate Page |date=February 1, 2012 |access-date=October 15, 2015 |website=Tampa Bay Area National Weather Service |last=Cole |first=Brian |archive-date=October 20, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020032631/http://w1.weather.gov/data/obhistory/KTPA.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=National Weather Service – Tampa Bay: Record lows.

====Spring====
Tampa has a slow increase in average temperatures beginning in mid-February, and spring brings mostly warm and sunny weather to the area. While temperatures in late spring approach summertime values, the rainy season does not usually begin until June, leading to the threat of [[brush fire]]s from approximately late March until May. Occasionally, a late-season cold front pushes through the area, potentially bringing a brief round of severe weather followed by a few days of unseasonably cool temperatures.

Tampa is currently represented by teams in three major professional sports leagues: the [[National Football League]], the [[National Hockey League]], and [[Major League Baseball]]. The [[NFL]]'s [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] and the [[NHL]]'s [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] call Tampa home, while the [[Tampa Bay Rays]] of the [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] play across the bay in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]]. As indicated by their names, these teams, plus several other sports teams, represent the entire [[Tampa Bay Area|Tampa metropolitan area]]. Tampa Bay's professional teams have won eight combined championships in their respective leagues.

The Tampa Bay area has long been a site for Major League Baseball [[spring training]] facilities and [[minor league baseball]] teams. The [[New York Yankees]] conduct spring training in Tampa, and their [[Low-A (baseball)|Low-A]] affiliate [[Tampa Tarpons]] play there in the summer.

On the collegiate level, the [[South Florida Bulls|University of South Florida Bulls]] compete in 17 sports in [[NCAA Division I]] and the [[Tampa Spartans|University of Tampa Spartans]] compete in 20 sports in [[NCAA Division II]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Athletics and Fitness {{!}} University of South Florida |url=https://www.usf.edu/campus-life/athletics-fitness.aspx |access-date=October 18, 2020 |website=www.usf.edu |archive-date=October 27, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201027191546/https://www.usf.edu/campus-life/athletics-fitness.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=University of Tampa Athletics |url=https://www.tampaspartans.com/landing/index |access-date=October 18, 2020 |website=University of Tampa Athletics |language=en |archive-date=November 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201101005238/https://www.tampaspartans.com/landing/index |url-status=live }}</ref>

Between September 2020 and July 2021 all three of Tampa Bay's major teams, as well as the Tampa Bay Rowdies, qualified for their sport's championship series. The Lightning beat the Dallas Stars in the [[2020 Stanley Cup Finals]], the Rays lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the [[2020 World Series]], the Rowdies and Phoenix Rising FC were named co-league champions after the USL Championship game was canceled due to [[COVID-19]], the Buccaneers beat the Kansas City Chiefs in the first home-game victory in [[Super Bowl LV|Super Bowl]] history, and the Lightning beat the Montreal Canadiens in the [[2021 Stanley Cup Finals]]. This dynasty earned the area the nickname "'''Champa Bay'''".<ref>{{cite web |last=Baker |first=Matt |date=February 8, 2021 |title=Tampa Bay Joins Elite Company with Second Pro Title in a Year |url=https://www.tampabay.com/sports/bucs/2021/02/09/tampa-bay-joins-elite-company-with-second-pro-title-in-a-year/ |access-date=July 8, 2021 |work=Tampa Bay Times |archive-date=July 9, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709190907/https://www.tampabay.com/sports/bucs/2021/02/09/tampa-bay-joins-elite-company-with-second-pro-title-in-a-year/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=2021-07-07 |title='Champa Bay' celebrates third pro title in less than a year |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/champa-bay-celebrates-pro-third-title-in-less-than-a-year/ |access-date=2021-07-09 |website=The Seattle Times |language=en-US |archive-date=July 9, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709185556/https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/champa-bay-celebrates-pro-third-title-in-less-than-a-year/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Football===

====Buccaneers====

The [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] began in [[1976 NFL season|1976]] as an expansion team of the [[NFL]]. They struggled at first, losing their first 26 games in a row to set a league record for futility. After a brief taste of success in the late 1970s, the Bucs again returned to their losing ways, and at one point lost at least 10 games for 12 seasons in a row.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/tam/ |title=Tampa Bay Buccaneers Team Encyclopedia - Pro-Football-Reference.com |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |access-date=March 23, 2018 |archive-date=March 16, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316042248/https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/tam/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The hiring of [[Tony Dungy]] in [[1996 NFL season|1996]] started an improving trend that eventually led to the team's victory in [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] in [[2002 NFL season|2003]] under coach [[Jon Gruden]]. They won their second championship in [[Super Bowl LV]] with quarterback Tom Brady and became the first NFL team to ever win a Super Bowl at their home stadium.

====Storm====
Originally the Pittsburgh Gladiators and a charter member of the [[Arena Football League]] (AFL), the [[Tampa Bay Storm]] relocated from [[Pittsburgh]] in [[1991 Arena Football League season|1991]] and won [[ArenaBowl V]] that year. They later won 4 more [[ArenaBowl]]s ([[ArenaBowl VII|VII]], [[ArenaBowl IX|IX]], [[ArenaBowl X|X]], and [[ArenaBowl XVII|XVII]], and also appeared in [[ArenaBowl I]], [[ArenaBowl III|III]], [[ArenaBowl XII|XII]], [[ArenaBowl XXIII|XXIII]] and [[ArenaBowl XXX|XXX]]), and their five championships were the most in league history.<ref>{{cite web |title=ArenaBowl |url=http://www.arenafootball.com/history/arenabowl.html |website=arenafootball.com |access-date=December 22, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102172741/http://www.arenafootball.com/history/arenabowl.html |archive-date=January 2, 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The AFL suffered through several years of decreasing revenue in the 2010s, leading to fewer active franchises. There were only five teams during the [[2017 Arena Football League season|2017 season]], after which the Storm's ownership group suspended operations.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.tampabay.com/blogs/lightning/2017/12/21/tampa-bay-storm-suspending-operations/ |title=Tampa Bay Storm suspending operations |date=December 21, 2017 |access-date=January 9, 2018 |archive-date=December 22, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222014736/http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/lightning/2017/12/21/tampa-bay-storm-suspending-operations/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Bandits====
Tampa was also home to the [[Tampa Bay Bandits]] of the [[United States Football League]]. The Bandits made the playoffs twice in their three seasons under head coach [[Steve Spurrier]] and drew league-leading crowds to Tampa Stadium, but the team folded along with the rest of the USFL after the [[1985 USFL season|1985 season]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tboblogs.com/index.php/sports/story/happy-anniversary-bandits-you-were-fun/ |title=Breakfast Bonus – Tom McEwen- from TBO.com Sports |work=tboblogs.com |access-date=January 16, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716194713/http://www.tboblogs.com/index.php/sports/story/happy-anniversary-bandits-you-were-fun/ |archive-date=July 16, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Tampa Bay Bandits – USFL (United States Football League) |url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/usfl/bandits.php |website=oursportscentral.com |access-date=December 25, 2015 |archive-date=January 2, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102172739/http://www.oursportscentral.com/usfl/bandits.php |url-status=live }}</ref> They played at [[Tampa Stadium]], which hosted the 1984 USFL Championship Game.<ref>{{cite web |title=USFL.info – Tampa Bay Bandits |url=http://www.usfl.info/bandits/ |website=usfl.info |access-date=December 25, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151214034029/http://www.usfl.info/bandits/ |archive-date=December 14, 2015}}</ref>

====Vipers====
The [[Tampa Bay Vipers]] play in the second edition of the [[XFL (2020)|XFL]]. Their inaugural season was cut short after five weeks due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. The team relocated to [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], and now are the [[Las Vegas Vipers]].

====Tornadoes====
The [[Tampa Bay Tornadoes]] were founded in 2020 and describe themselves as the successors to the defunct Tampa Bay Storm. They play in the [[American Arena League]].

===Baseball===
{{main|Baseball in the Tampa Bay area}}

====History====
The Tampa Bay area has long been home to nationally competitive amateur baseball and has hosted [[spring training]] and [[minor league baseball|minor league]] teams for over a century. Tampa became the first city in Florida to host a major league team for spring training in 1913, when the [[Chicago Cubs]] trained at [[Plant Field]]. The [[Tampa Smokers]] were the city's first minor league team, beginning play as charter members of the new [[Florida State League]] in 1919.

====Rays====
After decades of trying to lure an existing [[Major League Baseball]] franchise, the Tampa Bay area finally gained a team in 1998, when the expansion [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] began play at [[Tropicana Field]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]]. After a decade of futility on the field, the Devil Rays shortened their nickname to simply Rays in 2008 and promptly won the [[2008 American League Championship Series|2008]] [[American League]] [[American League Championship Series|Pennant]], finishing runner up in [[2008 World Series|World Series]]. They also won [[American League East]] titles in 2008 and 2010 under manager [[Joe Maddon]] before slipping back in the standings.

In 2007, the Rays began the process of searching for a stadium site closer to the center of the area's population, possibly in Tampa.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Tampa Bay Rays can leave Tropicana Field contract |url=https://www.si.com/mlb/2015/10/23/tampa-bay-rays-tropicana-field-contract |magazine=Sports Illustrated |access-date=January 19, 2016 |archive-date=February 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206180533/http://www.si.com/mlb/2015/10/23/tampa-bay-rays-tropicana-field-contract |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.tbo.com/content/2010/may/19/group-seeks-land-rays-stadium-downtown-tampa/sports-rays/ |title=Group seeks land for Rays stadium in downtown Tampa |publisher=.tbo.com |date=May 19, 2010 |access-date=April 17, 2011 |archive-date=May 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525061439/http://www2.tbo.com/content/2010/may/19/group-seeks-land-rays-stadium-downtown-tampa/sports-rays/ |url-status=live }}</ref> However, over a decade later, rivalry between Tampa and St. Petersburg and the challenges of financing a new ballpark have kept the Rays playing at Tropicana Field.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-more-urgency-needed-on-rays-stadium-search/2318586/ |title=Editorial: More urgency needed on Rays stadium search |newspaper=Tampa Bay Times |date=March 30, 2017 |access-date=March 23, 2018 |archive-date=March 22, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322195233/http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-more-urgency-needed-on-rays-stadium-search/2318586 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:GSFieldTB.JPG|thumb|[[George M. Steinbrenner Field|Steinbrenner Field]]]]

====Low-A Southeast====
Several Major League baseball teams conduct [[Spring training|Spring Training]] in the area, and most also operate minor league teams in the [[Low-A]] [[Low-A Southeast|Southeast]]. The major league [[New York Yankees]] and the affiliated minor league [[Tampa Tarpons]] use [[George M. Steinbrenner Field]] across [[Dale Mabry Highway]] from Raymond James Stadium.

Across the bay in Pinellas County, the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] affiliate [[Clearwater Threshers]] and [[Toronto Blue Jays]] affiliate [[Dunedin Blue Jays]] also play in the Low-A Southeast. Other nearby Low-A Southeast teams include the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] affiliate [[Bradenton Marauders]] and the [[Detroit Tigers]] affiliate [[Lakeland Flying Tigers]]. The Phillies, Blue Jays, Pirates, and Tigers all play their Spring Training games at their minor league teams' ballparks.

The Tarpons have won five league titles, the Flying Tigers have won four, the Threshers have won two, and the Blue Jays and Marauders have each won one.

The area was formerly home to many teams in the former [[Florida State League]] that no longer exist, most notably the [[Tampa Smokers]], [[St. Petersburg Saints]], and the [[Tampa Tarpons (1957–1988)|original Tampa Tarpons]].

===Hockey===

====Lightning====
[[File:Amalie Arena.jpg|thumb|[[Amalie Arena]] is where the Tampa Bay Lightning have their home games]]
The [[NHL]]'s [[Tampa Bay Lightning]], named after the city's propensity for attracting lightning unlike any other on the continent, was established in 1992, and play their home games at [[Amalie Arena]] in [[downtown Tampa]]. In [[2004 Stanley Cup Finals|2004]], the team won their first [[Stanley Cup]] by defeating the [[Calgary Flames]] in 7 games. After this first championship and an ensuing [[2004–05 NHL lockout|season-wide lockout]], the Lightning went 1–3 in four Conference Final appearances in [[2011 Stanley Cup Playoffs|2011]], [[2015 Stanley Cup Playoffs|2015]], [[2016 Stanley Cup Playoffs|2016]] and [[2018 Stanley Cup playoffs|2018]], winning only in 2015 to lose to the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] in the ensuing [[2015 Stanley Cup Finals|Finals]].  Then the Lightning won back-to-back Stanley Cups in [[2020 Stanley Cup Finals|2020]] and [[2021 Stanley Cup Finals|2021]] with victories over the [[Dallas Stars]] and fellow [[Atlantic Division (NHL)#2021–present|Atlantic Division]] member [[Montreal Canadiens]] respectively.

Tampa hosted the skills contests and [[63rd National Hockey League All-Star Game|2018 NHL All-Star Game]] weekend on January 27–28, 2018.  Former captain [[Steve Stamkos]] is the franchise's top scorer with 555 goals across sixteen seasons before signing a new contract with the [[Nashville Predators]] after the [[2023–24 NHL season]].

===Soccer===

====Rowdies====
The [[Tampa Bay Rowdies]] compete in the [[USL Championship|United Soccer League Championship]] after spending their first 6 seasons in the [[North American Soccer League (2011–2017)|North American Soccer League]]. The team began play at Tampa's [[George M. Steinbrenner Field]] in 2010, then moved to St. Petersburg's [[Al Lang Field]] in 2011.

Previously, Tampa had hosted two top-level soccer teams. The [[Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975–93)|Tampa Bay Rowdies]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968–1984)|original North American Soccer League]] was the area's first major sports franchise, beginning play in 1975 at Tampa Stadium. The Rowdies were an immediate success, drawing good crowds and winning [[Soccer Bowl '75]] in their first season to bring Tampa its first professional sports championship. Though the NASL ceased operations in 1984, the Rowdies continued to compete in various soccer leagues until finally folding in 1993.

====Mutiny====
The success of the Rowdies prompted [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) to award Tampa a charter member of the new league in 1996. The [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] were the first MLS [[Supporters' Shield]] winner and had much early success beginning in [[1996 Major League Soccer season|1996]]. However, the club folded in [[2001 MLS season|2001]] when local ownership could not be secured mainly due to a financially poor lease agreement for [[Raymond James Stadium]]. The city has no representation in MLS, however, the Rowdies are seeking to join the league.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2017/01/09/mls-expansion-city-tampa-bay-rowdies-st-petersburg |title=MLS expansion city profile: Tampa Bay/St. Petersburg |last=Straus |first=Brian |newspaper=Sports Illustrated |access-date=January 10, 2017 |archive-date=January 10, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110143037/http://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2017/01/09/mls-expansion-city-tampa-bay-rowdies-st-petersburg |url-status=live }}</ref>

Tampa has several freeways which serve the city. There are two tolled freeways bringing traffic in and out of Tampa. The [[Lee Roy Selmon Expressway]] (SR 618), runs from suburban [[Brandon, Florida|Brandon]] at its eastern terminus, through Downtown Tampa, to the neighborhoods in South Tampa (near [[MacDill Air Force Base]]) at its western terminus. The [[Florida State Road 589|Veterans Expressway]] (SR 589), meanwhile connects [[Tampa International Airport]] and the bay bridges to the northwestern suburbs of [[Carrollwood, Florida|Carrollwood]], [[Greater Northdale, Florida|Northdale]], [[Westchase, Florida|Westchase]], [[Citrus Park, Florida|Citrus Park]], [[Cheval, Florida|Cheval]], and [[Lutz, Florida|Lutz]], before continuing north as the [[Florida State Road 589|Suncoast Parkway]] into [[Pasco County, Florida|Pasco]] and [[Hernando County, Florida|Hernando]] counties.

Three of the city's freeways carry the [[interstate highway system|interstate highway]] designation. [[Interstate 4]] and [[Interstate 275 (Florida)|Interstate 275]] cut across the city and intersect near downtown. [[Interstate 75 in Florida|Interstate 75]] runs along the east side of town for much of its route through [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]] until veering to the west to bisect New Tampa.
