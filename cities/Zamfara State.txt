==History==
{{Main article|History of Zamfara}}
[[File:Zamfara state Gallery at Arewa House museum.jpg|thumb|Zamfara State Museum.]]
The people of Zamfara have over the years struggled for autonomy, but it was not until 1996 that the then military administration of the late [[Sani Abacha|General Sani Abacha]] detached the Zamfara State from [[Sokoto State]] with an area of 38,418 square kilometres. The first Governor was [[Jibril Yakubu]].<ref name=":3"/>{{failed verification|date=August 2022}}

The area today called Zamfara state was one of the old [[Hausa Kingdoms]] like Kano, Katsina, Gobir, Kabi and Zazzau. The earliest inhabitants of Zamfara were said to have been hunters and giants.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Zamfara Gold Mining Factory|url=https://krzysztofpilarczyk.pl/Jun/08-36678.html|access-date=2021-06-26|website=krzysztofpilarczyk.pl|archive-date=2021-06-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210626233905/https://krzysztofpilarczyk.pl/Jun/08-36678.html|url-status=live}}</ref> They established their first settlement at Dutsi, which was the first capital of Zamfara. It extends up to the bend of [[River Rima]] to the north west and River Ka in the south west. Zamfara Kingdom was established in the 11th century and flourished up to 16th century as a city-state. Its capital has shifted with the fortunes of the kingdom from place to place like Dutsi and Birnin Zamfara.

In the first half of the 18th century, its then capital Birnin Zamfara, was destroyed by the [[Gobir|Gobir Kingdom]] and a new capital was established in [[Anka, Nigeria|Anka]] by the second half of the 19th century. Zamfara had many centres of commerce and scholarship that attracted many scholars like the Yandoto city. It became part of the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] after the 1804 [[jihad]] by [[Usman dan Fodio]]. In fact, Usman Danfodiyo settled in [[Sabon Gari]] where Sarkin Zamfara Abarshi had already established a garrison headquarters during the early days of his Jihad as a base from where he fought Gobir and Kabi.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Zamfara State, Nigeria Genealogy|url=https://www.familysearch.org/wiki/en/Zamfara_State,_Nigeria_Genealogy|access-date=2021-06-26|website=FamilySearch Wiki|date=11 April 2020|language=en|archive-date=2021-10-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211015144631/https://www.familysearch.org/wiki/en/Zamfara_State,_Nigeria_Genealogy|url-status=live}}</ref>

At the wake of British colonialism, the emerging town of Gusau became an important commercial and administrative centre with road and rail networks passing through it. With the creation of states during the [[Yakubu Gowon|Gowon]] Administration, Zamfara Kingdom became part of the then North West state and later the Sokoto State.<ref name=":0" />
