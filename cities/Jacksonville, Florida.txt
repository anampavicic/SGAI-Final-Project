The area of the modern city of Jacksonville has been inhabited for thousands of years. On [[Black Hammock Island]] in the national [[Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve]], a [[University of North Florida]] team discovered some of the oldest remnants of [[pottery]] in the United States, dating to 2500 BCE.<ref name=FTU>{{Cite news|title= The Mocama: New name for an old people|first= Matt|last= Soergel|newspaper= [[The Florida Times-Union]]|date= October 18, 2009 |url= http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2009-10-18/story/the_mocama_new_name_for_an_old_people|access-date= August 3, 2010}}</ref>

In the 16th century, the beginning of the historical era, the region was inhabited by the [[Mocama]], a coastal subgroup of the [[Timucua]] people. At the time of contact with Europeans, all Mocama villages in present-day Jacksonville were part of the powerful [[chiefdom]] known as the [[Saturiwa]], centered around the mouth of the [[St. Johns River]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Timucua|last= Milanich|first= Jerald|author-link= Jerald T.

In 1562, French [[Huguenot]] explorer [[Jean Ribault]] charted the [[St. Johns River]], calling it the River of May because that was the month of his discovery.

Spain ceded Florida to the British in 1763 as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in the aftermath of the [[Seven Years' War]] (known as the [[French and Indian War]] on the North American front). The British soon constructed the [[King's Road (Florida)|King's Road]] connecting St. Augustine to [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]]. The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point, which the [[Seminole]] called ''Wacca Pilatka'' and the British called the Cow Ford; these names reflected the use of the ford for moving cattle across the river there.<ref>{{cite book |title= Jacksonville's Architectural Heritage |last= Wood |first= Wayne |year= 1992 |publisher= [[University Press of Florida]] |isbn= 0-8130-0953-7|page= 22}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title= The Indian Miscellany |last= Beach |first= William Wallace |year= 1877 |publisher= J.

The British introduced the cultivation of [[sugarcane]], [[indigo]], and fruits as [[cash crop]]s on [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|plantations]], in addition to exporting lumber. A large number of British colonists who were "energetic and of good character" were given land grants in the region and emigrated to the region, becoming the first English-speaking population in Florida. These colonists came from England, Georgia, South Carolina and Bermuda. British judges introduced the system of [[common law]] to Florida, resulting in the Floridian legal system utilizing concepts such as [[Jury trial|trial-by-jury]], [[habeas corpus]] and county-based government.<ref>Caroline Mays Brevard, Henry Eastman Bennett, ''A History of Florida,'' American Book Company (1913)</ref><ref>''The Land Policy in British East Florida'' by [[C.

After their defeat in the [[American Revolutionary War]], Britain returned control of the territory to Spain in 1783 via the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]]. The settlement at the Cow Ford continued to grow.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

After Spain ceded the [[Florida Territory]] to the United States in 1821, American settlers on the north side of the Cow Ford decided to plan a town, laying out the streets and plats. They named the town Jacksonville, after celebrated war hero and first Territorial Governor (later U.S. president) [[Andrew Jackson]]. Led by [[Isaiah Hart|Isaiah D. Hart]], residents wrote a charter for a town government, which the Florida Legislative Council approved on February 9, 1832.

During the [[American Civil War]], Duval County produced several units that fought for the [[Confederate States Army]]. At least two were raised out of Jacksonville: the [[Jacksonville Light Infantry]], a militia unit formed in 1859, and the Duval County Cow Boys, mustered in during the summer of 1861. Both units fought as part of the [[3rd Florida Infantry Regiment|3rd Florida Infantry]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martin |first1=Richard A. |title=Defeat in Victory: Yankee Experience in Early Civil War Jacksonville |journal=The Florida Historical Quarterly |date=July 1974 |volume=53 |issue=1 |page=4 |url=http://palmm.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/ucf%3A25424}}</ref> The St. John's Greys, the Milton Artillery, and Company H of [[1st Florida Cavalry Regiment]] were also all formed by men from Jacksonville.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Proctor |first1=Samuel |title=Jacksonville during the Civil War |journal=Florida Historical Quarterly |date=April 1963 |volume=41 |issue=4 |page=345 |url=http://palmm.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/ucf%3A22393 |access-date=November 13, 2022}}</ref>

Jacksonville was also a key supply point for hogs and cattle shipped from Florida to feed the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces.  The city was blockaded by [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces, who gained control of nearby [[Fort Clinch]]. Though no battles were fought in Jacksonville proper, the city changed hands several times between Union and Confederate forces. In the [[Skirmish of the Brick Church]] in 1862, Confederates won their first victory in the state.<ref name="Metro Jacksonville">{{cite web|title=Lost Church, Lost Battlefield, Lost Cemetery, Lost War|url=http://www.metrojacksonville.com/article/2010-mar-lost-church-lost-battlefield-lost-cemetery-lost-war#.VChumfldW8E|website=metrojacksonville.com|publisher=Metro Jacksonville|access-date=September 28, 2014}}</ref> However, Union forces captured a Confederate position at the [[Battle of St. Johns Bluff]], and occupied Jacksonville in 1862. Slaves escaped to freedom in Union lines. In February 1864 Union forces left Jacksonville and confronted a [[Confederate Army]] at the [[Battle of Olustee]], going down to defeat.

Union forces retreated to Jacksonville and held the city for the remainder of the war. In March 1864 a Confederate cavalry confronted a Union expedition in the [[Battle of Cedar Creek (Jacksonville)|Battle of Cedar Creek]]. Warfare and the long occupation left the city disrupted after the war.<ref>{{cite web|title=Events Leading up to the Battle of Olustee|url=http://battleofolustee.org/events.html|website=battleofolustee.org|publisher=battleofolustee|access-date=March 9, 2016}}</ref>

During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] and the [[Gilded Age]], Jacksonville and nearby St. Augustine became popular winter [[resorts]] for the rich and famous. Visitors arrived by [[steamboat]] and later by railroad. President [[Grover Cleveland]] attended the Sub-Tropical Exposition in the city on February 22, 1888, during his trip to Florida.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xjD5x9F1WyoC |title=Presidential visits to Florida ... – Google Books |access-date=July 1, 2010|last1=Osborne |first1=Ray }}</ref> This highlighted the visibility of the state as a worthy place for tourism. The city's tourism, however, was dealt major blows in the late 19th century by [[yellow fever]] outbreaks. Extending the [[Florida East Coast Railway]] further south drew visitors to other areas. From 1893 to 1938, Jacksonville was the site of the Florida Old Confederate [[Old soldiers home|Soldiers and Sailors Home]]; it operated a nearby cemetery.<ref>{{cite web|title=Old Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Home 1893 – 1938|work=Kirby Smith Camp #1209, Sons of Confederate Veterans|url=http://www.scv-kirby-smith.org/confederateHOME.htm|access-date=January 27, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728005902/http://www.scv-kirby-smith.org/confederateHOME.htm|archive-date=July 28, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Firejax1901.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the courthouse and armory from the [[Great Fire of 1901]]]]
On May 3, 1901, downtown Jacksonville was ravaged by a fire that started as a kitchen fire. Spanish moss at a nearby mattress factory was quickly engulfed in flames and enabled the fire to spread rapidly. In a mere eight hours, it swept through 146 city blocks, destroyed over 2,000 buildings, left about 10,000 homeless and killed seven residents. The Confederate Monument in [[Hemming Park]] was one of the few landmarks to survive the fire. [[William Sherman Jennings|Governor William Sherman Jennings]] declared [[martial law]] and sent the state militia to maintain order; on May 17, municipal authority resumed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Great Jacksonville Fire of 1901|url=https://www.floridamemory.com/photographiccollection/photo_exhibits/jacksonvillefire/|publisher=Florida Memory|access-date=April 18, 2015}}</ref> It is said the glow from the flames could be seen in [[Savannah, Georgia]], and the smoke plumes seen in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]. Known as the "[[Great Fire of 1901]]", it was one of the worst disasters in Florida history and the largest urban fire in the southeastern United States.

In the 1910s, northern film studios headquartered in New York City, Philadelphia, and Chicago were attracted to Jacksonville's warm climate, exotic landscapes, excellent rail access, and cheap labor. More than 30 [[silent film]] [[Movie studio|studios]] were established over the decade, earning Jacksonville the title of "Winter Film Capital of the World". However, the emergence of [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] as a major film production center ended the city's film industry. One movie studio site, [[Norman Studios]], remains in [[Arlington, Jacksonville, Florida|Arlington]]; it has been converted to the Jacksonville Silent Film Museum at Norman Studios.<ref name="normanstudios">{{cite web|url=http://www.normanstudios.org/ |title=The Jacksonville Silent Film Museum at Norman Studios |access-date=July 19, 2007 }}</ref>

During this time, Jacksonville also became a banking and insurance center, with companies such as [[Barnett Bank]], [[Atlantic National Bank]], [[Florida National Bank]], [[Prudential Financial|Prudential]], Gulf Life, Afro-American Insurance, Independent Life and American Heritage Life thriving in the business district. The [[Walker Business College]] was opened {{Circa|1916}} in Jacksonville and advertised that it was the largest African American business school in the United States.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Du Bois |first=William Edward Burghardt |date=1920 |title=Walker Business College for Colored |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgtFAQAAMAAJ |journal=[[The Crisis]] |volume=21-22 |language=en |publisher=Crisis Publishing Company |pages=39 |issn=0011-1422}}</ref>

====1940 to 1979====

[[File:Vice President Nixon delivering campaign speech in Hemming Park - Jacksonville, Florida.jpg|thumb|Crowd gathered for a campaign speech from [[Richard Nixon]] in Hemming Park in October 1960]]
During [[World War II]], The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] became a major employer and economic force, constructing three Navy bases in the city, while the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] established Blount Island Command.

Jacksonville, like most large cities in the United States, suffered from many negative effects of rapid [[urban sprawl]] after [[World War II]]. The construction of federal highways essentially subsidized development of suburban housing, and wealthier, better established residents moved to newer housing in the suburbs. After World War II, the government of the city of Jacksonville began to increase spending to fund new public building projects in the postwar economic boom. Mayor [[W. Haydon Burns]]' ''Jacksonville Story'' resulted in the construction of a new city hall, civic auditorium, public library and other projects that created a sense of civic pride. Development of suburbs led to a growing middle class who lived outside the urban core. An increasing proportion of residents in Jacksonville's urban core had a higher than average rate of poverty, especially as businesses and jobs also migrated to the suburbs.<ref name="census"/>

Given the postwar migration of residents, businesses, and jobs, the city's tax base declined. It had difficulty funding education, sanitation, and traffic control within the city limits. In addition, residents in unincorporated suburbs had difficulty obtaining municipal services, such as sewage and building code enforcement. In 1958, a study recommended the city of Jacksonville begin annexing outlying communities to create the needed larger geographic tax base to improve services throughout the county. Voters outside the city limits rejected annexation plans in six referendums between 1960 and 1965.

On [[Ax Handle Saturday|August 27, 1960]], a white mob attacked civil rights demonstrators in [[Hemming Park]] with clubs. The police largely stood by.

In 1962, a federal court ordered the city to prepare a plan for integration of public schools, in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954). A study found schools were in poor condition and poorly equipped.

On December 29, 1963, the [[Hotel Roosevelt fire]] killed 22 people, the highest one-day death toll in Jacksonville.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2013-12-28/story/roosevelt-hotel-fire-22-people-died-blaze-heroes-prevented-total-being|title=Roosevelt Hotel Fire: 22 people died in blaze, but heroes prevented that total from being even higher|last1=Soergel|first1=Matt|date=December 28, 2013|access-date=October 11, 2016|newspaper=[[The Florida Times-Union]]}}</ref> On September 10, 1964, [[Hurricane Dora (1964)|Hurricane Dora]] made landfall near [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], causing major damage to buildings in North Florida.

In the mid-1960s, corruption scandals arose among city and some county officials, who were mainly part of a traditional white Democratic network that had dominated politics for the decades since the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement of most African Americans]] at the turn of the 20th century which effectively hollowed out the Republican Party. After a [[grand jury]] was convened to investigate, 11 officials were indicted and more were forced to resign.
[[File:Jax Consolidation Headline 1967.jpg|thumb|right|News of Jacksonville's consolidation from ''[[The Florida Times-Union]]'']]
In 1963 the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] threatened to withdraw accreditation of area schools in a year because of "instructional deficiencies". But voters refused to approve new taxes to improve school conditions. In late 1963, Duval County was spending $299 per student compared to the state average spending of $372 per student. In 1964 all 15 of Duval County's public high schools lost their accreditation.<ref>[http://www.qeafund.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Timeline-2016-Version.pdf "Public Schools in Duval County: Timeline of Major Events, 1864–2014"], Jacksonville Public Education Fund, 2014; accessed June 10, 2019</ref> This added momentum to proposals for government reform.

[[Jacksonville Consolidation]], led by [[J. J. Daniel]] and [[Claude Yates]], began to win more support during this period, from both inner-city blacks, who wanted more involvement in government after passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], that provided federal oversight and enforcement of their right to vote, and whites in the suburbs, who wanted more services and more control over the central city. Lower taxes, increased economic development, unification of the community, better public spending, and effective administration by a more central authority were all cited as reasons for a new consolidated government.

When a [[Consolidated city-county|consolidation]] referendum was held in 1967, voters approved the plan with a 65 percent approval. On October 1, 1968, the city and county governments merged to create the Consolidated City of Jacksonville. Fire, police, health & welfare, recreation, public works, and housing & urban development were all combined under the new government. In honor of the occasion, then-Mayor [[Hans Tanzler]] posed with actress [[Lee Meredith]] behind a sign marking the new border of the "Bold New City of the [[American South|South]]" at Florida 13 and Julington Creek.<ref>{{cite web|title=Consolidation's Most Famous Photo |url=http://www.jaxhistory.com/journal11.html |work=Jax History Journal |publisher=Jacksonville Historical Society |access-date=March 28, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228013235/http://jaxhistory.com/journal11.html |archive-date=February 28, 2012 }}</ref> The consolidation created a 900-square-mile entity.

[[Ed Austin]] was elected as mayor in 1991. His most lasting contribution is the [[River City Renaissance]] program, a $235&nbsp;million bond issued in 1993 by the city of Jacksonville which funded [[urban renewal]] and revamped the city's historic downtown neighborhoods. Austin oversaw the city's purchase and refurbishing of the [[St. James Building]], which is now used as Jacksonville's [[city hall]].

The first notable retail transaction involving physical goods was paid on May 22, 2010, by exchanging 10,000 mined BTC for two pizzas delivered from a [[Papa John's]] in Jacksonville, Florida. Laszlo Hanyecz, who lives in Jacksonville, created a thread on an online forum offering the bitcoins to anyone who would order him two pizzas. Jeremy Sturdivant, a user from England, accepted the offer and had the pizzas sent to Hayecz's home. The 10,000 Bitcoins were worth about US$40 at the time. A plaque was mounted on the wall of the restaurant commemorating the day, with the declaration that Jacksonville is the "Home of the first Bitcoin purchase".

===Topography===
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|874.3|sqmi|km2}}, making Jacksonville the largest city in land area in the [[Continental United States|contiguous United States]]; of this, 86.66% ({{convert|757.7|sqmi|km2|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is land and 13.34% ({{convert|116.7|sqmi|km2|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is water. Jacksonville completely surrounds the town of [[Baldwin, Florida|Baldwin]]. [[Nassau County, Florida|Nassau County]] lies to the north, [[Baker County, Florida|Baker County]] lies to the west, and [[Clay County, Florida|Clay]] and [[St. Johns County, Florida|St. Johns]] counties lie to the south. Jacksonville has a coast on the Atlantic Ocean with the [[Jacksonville Beaches]]. The city developed along both sides of the [[St. Johns River]]. The [[Trout River (Florida)|Trout River]], a major tributary of the St. Johns River, is entirely within Jacksonville.

Soil composition is primarily sand and clay rather than limestone, so few [[sinkhole]]s develop; however, deep, large diameter sinkholes do occur.<ref>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Chad|title=This could be the start of a big sinkhole season|url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20120514/ARTICLES/120519772?p=1&tc=pg|access-date=May 17, 2012|newspaper=Gainesville Sun|date=May 14, 2012}}</ref>

Jacksonville's location on the [[St. Johns River]] and the Atlantic Ocean proved instrumental to the growth of the city and its industry. Jacksonville has a sizable deepwater port, which helps make it a leading port in the U.S. for [[automobile]] imports, as well as the leading transportation and [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] hub in the state. The strength of the city's economy lies in its broad diversification. While the area once had many thriving dairies, such as [[Gustafson's Farm]] and [[Skinner Dairy]], this aspect of the economy has declined over time. The area's economy is balanced among [[Distribution (business)|distribution]], [[financial services]], [[biomedical technology]], [[consumer goods]], information services, manufacturing, insurance, and other industries.

Jacksonville is home to the headquarters of four [[Fortune 500]] companies: [[CSX Corporation]], [[Fidelity National Financial]], [[Fidelity National Information Services]] and [[Southeastern Grocers]].<ref>{{cite news |url= https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2011/states/FL.html |title= Fortune 500: Florida|work= CNN Money |access-date=October 25, 2011}}</ref> [[Interline Brands]] is based in Jacksonville and is owned by [[The Home Depot]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bray|first1=Chad|title=Home Depot to Buy Interline Brands for $1.6 Billion in Cash|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/23/business/dealbook/home-depot-to-buy-interline-brands-for-1-6-billion-in-cash.html?_r=0|access-date=July 22, 2015|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 22, 2015}}</ref> Other notable companies based in Jacksonville or with a large presence include [[Florida Blue]], [[Swisher International Group]], [[BOA Merrill Lynch]], [[Fanatics (sports retailer)|Fanatics]], [[Crowley Maritime]], [[Web.com]], [[Firehouse Subs]] and [[Deutsche Bank]].

In 2008, Jacksonville had 2.8&nbsp;million visitors who stayed overnight, spending nearly $1&nbsp;billion. A study by Research Data Services of Tampa quantified the importance of tourism. The total economic impact was $1.6&nbsp;billion and supported nearly 43,000 jobs, 10% of the local workforce.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jacksonville.com/story/business/2009/05/12/city-visitors-left-1-billion-here-in-08/15986103007/|title=City visitors left $1 billion here in '08|website=The Florida Times-Union}}</ref>

Jacksonville has long had a regional legacy in banking and finance. Locally headquartered [[Atlantic National Bank]], [[Florida National Bank]] and [[Barnett Bank]] dominated the industry in Florida from the turn of the 20th century through the 1980s, before all being acquired in a national wave of mergers and acquisitions throughout the entire financial sector.

Jacksonville's [[financial sector]] has benefited from a rapidly changing business culture, as have other [[Sunbelt]] cities such as [[Atlanta]], [[Tampa]], and [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]. In a concept known as [[nearshoring]], financial institutions are shifting operations away from high-cost addresses such as [[Wall Street]], and have shifted some trading functions to Jacksonville.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Levin|first1=Jonathan|title=Wall Street Is Hiring ... in Florida |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-25/wall-street-is-hiring-in-florida|website=Bloomberg.com|date=January 25, 2017|publisher=Bloomberg|access-date=January 25, 2017}}</ref> With relatively low-cost real estate, easy access by planes to New York City, high quality of life, and 19,000 financial sector employees, Jacksonville has become an option for relocating staff.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gray|first1=Alistair|title=Move over NY — here comes Jacksonville |url=https://www.ft.com/content/e1ece4fa-17ac-11e6-bb7d-ee563a5a1cc1 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221210/https://www.ft.com/content/e1ece4fa-17ac-11e6-bb7d-ee563a5a1cc1 |archive-date=December 10, 2022|url-access=subscription|newspaper=Financial Times|date=May 15, 2016|access-date=December 3, 2016}}</ref>

A handful of significant literary works and authors are associated with Jacksonville and the surrounding area. Perhaps the most important is [[James Weldon Johnson]], who moved North and was influential in the [[Harlem Renaissance]]. In 1920 he also became the first African American to lead the [[NAACP]] civil rights organization. His first success as a writer was the poem "[[Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing]]" (1899), which his brother [[Rosamond Johnson]] set to music; the song became unofficially known as the "Negro National Anthem".<ref>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Brian|title=Artistic Ambassadors|pages=57–59}}</ref>

The [[Florida Theatre]], also opened in 1927, is in downtown Jacksonville and is one of only four remaining high-style movie palaces that were built in Florida during the [[Mediterranean Revival Style architecture|Mediterranean Revival architectural]] boom of the 1920s. Since that time, Jacksonville has been chosen by a number of film and television studios for [[location shooting]]. Notable motion pictures that have been partially or completely shot in Jacksonville since the silent film era include the classic thriller, ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' (1954).<ref name="Movies Filmed in Jacksonville"/>

After his mother died when he was 15, [[Ray Charles]] lived with friends of his mother while he played piano at the Ritz for a year, before moving on to fame and fortune. The Ritz Theatre was rebuilt, and reopened in October 1999.

The [[Jacksonville Jazz Festival]] has been held for than 40 years. It takes place over the three-day Memorial Day weekend, and includes the Jacksonville Jazz Piano Competition.

During the 1960s, the [[Classics IV]] was the most successful pop rock band from Jacksonville. [[Southern Rock]] was defined by the [[Allman Brothers Band]], which formed in 1969 in Jacksonville. [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] achieved near cult status and inspired [[Blackfoot (band)|Blackfoot]], [[Molly Hatchet]] and [[38 Special (band)|.38 Special]], all successful in the 1970s. The 1980s were a quiet decade for musical talent in Jacksonville.

The [[Times-Union Center for the Performing Arts]] consists of three distinct halls: the ''Jim & Jan Moran Theater'', a venue for touring Broadway shows; the ''Jacoby Symphony Hall'', home of the [[Jacksonville Symphony Orchestra]]; and the ''Terry Theater'', intended for small shows and recitals. The building was originally erected as the Civic Auditorium in 1962 and underwent a major renovation and construction in 1996.

The next local group to achieve national success was the [[nu metal]] band [[Limp Bizkit]], formed in 1994. Other popular acts from Jacksonville were [[hip hop music|hip hop]] acts [[95 South]], [[69 Boyz]], and the [[Quad City DJ's]]. The bands [[Inspection 12]], [[Cold (band)|Cold]], and [[Yellowcard]] were also well known and had a large national following. After 2000, additional rock bands such as [[Fit For Rivals]], [[Burn Season]], [[Evergreen Terrace]], [[Shinedown]], [[The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus]], [[Electric President]], and [[Black Kids]] attained national attention for various [[hit song]]s and albums. In the 2010–20s, further urban developments resulted in numerous [[hip hop]] recording artists emerging from the city, some of whom have reached mainstream notability and signed to major labels. These include [[Nardo Wick]] (signed to [[RCA Records]]), [[SpotemGottem]] (signed to [[Geffen Records]]), [[YK Osiris]] (signed to [[Def Jam Recordings]]), [[Trap Beckham]] (also signed to Def Jam), and [[KaMillion]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.complex.com/music/a/erictheyounggawd/jacksonville-rap-explosive-rise | title=The Explosive Rise of Jacksonville Rap | website=[[Complex Networks]] }}</ref> Prior, [[Mase]] of [[Bad Boy Records]] fame was the only rapper to achieve such success hailing from the city.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/685278-rapper-mase-bad-boy | title=Who is Mase?

==Government and politics==

===Government===

{{Main|Government of Jacksonville}}
[[File:Jacksonville City Hall (South face).JPG|thumb|left|[[St. James Building]], currently housing Jacksonville City Hall]]
In 1968 Jacksonville and Duval County consolidated their governments in the [[Jacksonville Consolidation]]. This eliminated a separate county executive or legislature, and supplanted these positions with the Mayor of Jacksonville and the City Council of the City of Jacksonville, respectively. Because of this, voters who live ''outside'' of the city limits of Jacksonville but ''inside'' Duval County may vote in elections for these positions and run for them. In 1995, [[John Delaney (Florida politician)|John Delaney]], a resident of [[Neptune Beach, Florida|Neptune Beach]] within Duval County, was elected as mayor of the city of Jacksonville.

Jacksonville is organized under the [[city charter]] and provides for a "strong" [[Mayor–council government|mayor–council]] form of city government. The [[Mayor of Jacksonville]] is elected to four-year terms and serves as the head of the government's executive branch. The [[Jacksonville City Council]] comprises nineteen members, fourteen representing [[single-member district|single-member]] [[electoral district]]s of roughly equal populations, and five elected for [[at-large]] seats. The mayor oversees most city departments, though some are independent or quasi-independent. Law enforcement is provided by the [[Jacksonville Sheriff's Office]], headed by an elected [[sheriff]]; public schools are overseen by [[Duval County Public Schools]], and several services are provided by largely independent authorities. The mayor holds veto power over all resolutions and ordinances made by the city council and also has the power to hire and fire the heads of various city departments.

As before the consolidation, some government services are operated independently of city and county authority. In accordance with Florida law, the elected school board has nearly complete autonomy. Jacksonville also has several quasi-independent government agencies which only nominally answer to the consolidated authority, including [[JEA|electric authority]], port authority, transportation authority, housing authority and airport authority. The main environmental and agricultural body is the Duval County Soil and Water Conservation District, which works closely with other area, state, and federal agencies.
[[File:Deegan Donna-3327b.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Donna Deegan]], the current [[List of mayors of Jacksonville, Florida|mayor of Jacksonville]]]]

The [[Jacksonville Housing Authority]] (JHA) is the quasi-independent agency responsible for public housing and [[subsidized housing]] in Jacksonville. The Mayor and City Council of Jacksonville established the JHA in 1994 to create a community service-oriented, public housing agency with innovative ideas and a different attitude. The primary goal was to provide safe, clean, affordable housing for eligible low and moderate income families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. The secondary goal was to provide effective social services, work with residents to improve their quality of life, encourage employment and self-sufficiency, and help residents move out of assisted housing. To that end, JHA works with [[HabiJax]] to help low and moderate income families to escape the public housing cycle and become successful, productive, homeowners and taxpayers.

The present mayor is [[Donna Deegan]], who assumed office on July 1, 2023.<ref name="Mazeke">{{cite news |last1=Mazeke |first1=Jim Piggott, Kendra |title=History in the making: Donna Deegan sworn in as first woman to lead the River City |url=https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2023/07/01/history-in-the-making-donna-deegan-to-be-sworn-in-jacksonvilles-first-woman-mayor/ |work=WJXT |date=July 1, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230701180458/https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2023/07/01/history-in-the-making-donna-deegan-to-be-sworn-in-jacksonvilles-first-woman-mayor/ |archive-date=July 1, 2023 |access-date=July 3, 2023 |url-status=live }}</ref> Deegan's predecessor was [[Lenny Curry]].<ref>[http://jacksonville.com/slideshow/2015-07-01/new-mayor-and-sheriff-sworn-lenny-curry-and-mike-williams-take-oath-office#slide-1 INAUGURATION DAY: Lenny Curry and Mike Williams Take Oath of Office] Retrieved July 1, 2015</ref>

Most of the city lies in the [[Florida's 4th congressional district]], and is represented by Republican [[Aaron Bean]]. Most of central Jacksonville is in the [[Florida's 5th congressional district|5th district]], represented by Republican [[John Rutherford (Florida politician)|John Rutherford]]. 
In 2010, Duval County's [[crime rate]] was 5,106 per 100,000 people, according to the [[Florida Department of Law Enforcement]]. The county's murder rate had been the highest among Florida's counties with a population of 500,000 or more for eleven years as of 2009, leading to widespread discussion in the community about how to deal with the problem. In 2010, Duval County's violent crime rate decreased by 9.3% from the previous year, with total crime decreasing 7.3%, putting the murder rate behind that of [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Results are in: Duval County no longer state murder capital |first=Dana|last=Treen|url=http://jacksonville.com/news/crime/2011-04-26/story/results-are-duval-county-no-longer-state-murder-capital|newspaper=[[The Florida Times-Union]] |date=April 26, 2011|access-date=April 28, 2011}}</ref>

Jacksonville and Duval County historically maintained separate police agencies: the Jacksonville Police Department and Duval County Sheriff's Office. As part of consolidation in 1968, the two merged, creating the [[Jacksonville Sheriff's Office]] (JSO). The JSO is headed by the elected Sheriff of Jacksonville, currently T.K. Waters.<ref name="Gibson2022">{{cite news |last1=Gibson |first1=Travis |title=T.K.

===Public libraries===

{{Main|Jacksonville Public Library (Florida)}}
[[File:Jacksonville Main Library 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Jacksonville Main Library]]

The [[Jacksonville Public Library (Florida)|Jacksonville Public Library]] began when May Moore and Florence Murphy started the Jacksonville Library and Literary Association in 1878. The Association was populated by various prominent Jacksonville residents and sought to create a free public library and reading room for the city.<ref name="jplhistory">{{cite web|url=http://jaxpubliclibrary.org/lib/history.html |title=Jacksonville Public Library: A History |access-date=August 19, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210549/http://jaxpubliclibrary.org/lib/history.html |archive-date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref>

Over the course of 127 years, the system has grown from that one room library to become one of the largest in the state. The Jacksonville library system includes the Main Library and 20 branches, ranging in size from the {{convert|54000|sqft|m2|-2|abbr=on}} West Regional Library to smaller neighborhood libraries like Westbrook and Eastside. The Library annually receives nearly four million visitors and circulates over six&nbsp;million items. Nearly 500,000 library cards are held by area residents.<ref name="jplprofile">{{cite web|url=http://jaxpubliclibrary.org/lib/factsheet.html |title=Jacksonville Public Library: Profile |access-date=August 19, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210602/http://jaxpubliclibrary.org/lib/factsheet.html |archive-date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref>

Acosta Bridge]], the [[Fuller Warren Bridge]] (which carries [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]] traffic) and the [[Buckman Bridge|Henry Holland Buckman Bridge]] (which carries [[Interstate 295 (Florida)|I-295 North/South]] traffic). Also, next to the Acosta Bridge is a large jackknife railroad bridge built in the 1920s by Henry Flagler's FEC Railroad.

Beginning in 1953, tolls were charged on the Hart, Mathews, Fuller Warren and Main Street bridges to pay for bridge construction, renovations and many other highway projects. As Jacksonville grew, toll plazas created bottlenecks and caused delays and accidents during rush hours. In 1988, Jacksonville voters chose to eliminate toll collection and replace the revenue with a ½ cent local sales tax increase. In 1989, the toll booths were removed.

[[Interstate 10 in Florida|Interstate&nbsp;10]] (I-10) and [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]] intersect in Jacksonville, forming the busiest freeway interchange in the region with 200,000 vehicles each day.<ref>{{cite news |last= Hannan |first= Larry |url= http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2010-06-07/story/work-jacksonvilles-interstate-intersection-end-early-next-year |title= Jacksonville's scrambled I-10/I-95 intersection transforming traffic until 2011 |work= The Florida Times-Union |location= Jacksonville, FL |date= June 7, 2010}}</ref> I-10 ends at this intersection (the other end being in [[Santa Monica, California]]). Additionally, [[Florida State Road 202|State Road&nbsp;202]] (J. Turner Butler Boulevard) provides freeway access to the Jacksonville beaches from I-95 on the Southside.

I-95 has a [[bypass route]], [[Interstate 295 (Florida)|I-295]], which [[ring road|encircles]] the downtown area. The major freeway interchange at I-295 and SR&nbsp;202 was finally completed on December 24, 2008. [[Florida State Road 9B|SR&nbsp;9B]] was completed in late 2019, and connects I-295's southeast corner to the Bayard Area.<ref>{{cite news |last=Nelson |first=Tony |date=January 29, 2009 |title=What's in a direction?

[[U.S. Route 1 in Florida|U.S. Highway&nbsp;1]] (US&nbsp;1) and [[U.S. Route 17 in Florida|US&nbsp;17]] travel through the city from the south to the north, and [[U.S. Route 23 in Florida|US&nbsp;23]] enters the city [[Concurrency (road)|running concurrently]] with US&nbsp;1. In downtown, US&nbsp;23 splits from US&nbsp;1 and quickly runs to its southern terminus.
The eastern terminus of [[U.S. Route 90 in Florida|US&nbsp;90]] is in nearby [[Jacksonville Beach, Florida|Jacksonville Beach]] near the Atlantic Ocean.
US&nbsp;23's other end is in [[Mackinaw City, Michigan]].

Several regional transportation projects have been undertaken in recent years to deal with congestion on Jacksonville freeways. A $152 million project to create a high-speed interchange at the intersection of Interstates 10 and 95 began in February 2005, after the conclusion of [[Super Bowl XXXIX]]. Construction was expected to take nearly six years with multiple lane flyovers and the requirement that the interchange remain open throughout the project. The previous configuration used single lane, low speed, curved ramps which created backups during rush hours and contributed to accidents.<ref>Hannan, Larry: [http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2010-08-11/story/remodeled-intersection-i-10-i-95-almost-done-after-nearly-6-years "I-95/I-10 construction is almost done"] Florida Times-Union, August 11, 2010</ref>
Also, construction of SR 9B (future [[Interstate 795 (Florida)|Interstate 795]]), is currently underway.

====Transit system====

{{main|Jacksonville Transportation Authority}}
[[File:Newskyway.jpg|thumb|right|270px|upright|[[Jacksonville Skyway]]]]
The [[Jacksonville Skyway]] is an automated [[people mover]] connecting [[Florida State College at Jacksonville]] downtown campus, the Northbank central business district, [[Prime F. Osborn III Convention Center|Convention Center]], and Southbank locations. The system includes 8 stops connected by two lines. The existing train is a UMIII [[monorail]] built by Bombardier. The guideway consists of concrete beams which rest atop an unusually large support structure not used in most monorail systems. Maximum speed for the train is {{convert|48|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://www.monorails.org/tMspages/Jcksnvl.html "Monorails of North America"] The Monorail Society Website</ref>

A monorail was first proposed in the 1970s as part of a mobility plan hoping to attract interest from the Urban Mass Transit Administration's Downtown Peoplemover Program. The initial study was undertaken by the Florida Department of Transportation and Jacksonville's planning department, who took the Skyway project to the [[Jacksonville Transportation Authority]] (JTA) in 1977. Following further development and a final 18-month feasibility study, the UMTA selected Jacksonville as one of seven cities to receive federal funding for an automated people mover. Two other related projects are Miami's Metromover and Detroit's People Mover. UMTA's approved plan called for the construction of a {{convert|2.5|mi|km|adj=on}} Phase I system to be built in three segments.

====Modal characteristics====

In 2014, the Jacksonville was among the top large cities ranked by percentage of commuters who drove to work alone (80 percent).<ref>{{cite web|author=Freemark, Yonah|publisher=The Transport Politic|access-date=May 4, 2018|url=https://www.thetransportpolitic.com/databook/travel-mode-shares-in-the-u-s/|title=Travel mode shares in the U.S.|date=August 24, 2016}}</ref> According to the 2016 American Community Survey, 80 percent of city of Jacksonville residents commuted in single-occupancy vehicles, 8.6 percent carpooled, 2.6 percent used public transportation, and 2.7 percent walked. All other forms of transportation combined for 1.7 percent of the commuter [[modal share]], while 4.5 percent worked out of the home.<ref name=acs2016>{{cite web|publisher=Census Reporter|title=Means of Transportation to Work by Age|access-date=May 4, 2018|url=https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B08101&geo_ids=16000US1235000&primary_geo_id=16000US1235000}}</ref>

Some patterns of car ownership are similar to national averages. In 2015, 8.3 percent of city of Jacksonville households lacked a car, which increased slightly to 8.7 percent in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Jacksonville averaged 1.62 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Car Ownership in U.S. Cities Data and Map|journal=Governing|date=December 9, 2014|url=http://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html|access-date=May 4, 2018}}</ref>

====Rail====

[[Image:CSX 5508 ready to put office car on Silver Meteor atJacksonville, FL November 18, 1986 02 (22144391504).jpg|thumb|right|CSX 5508 ready to put office car on ''[[Silver Meteor]]'']]

[[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail system, provides daily service from the [[Jacksonville (Amtrak station)|Jacksonville Amtrak Station]] on Clifford Lane in the northwest section of the city. Two trains presently stop there, the ''[[Silver Meteor]]'' and ''[[Silver Star (passenger train)|Silver Star]]''. Jacksonville was also served by the thrice-weekly ''[[Sunset Limited]]'' and the daily ''[[Silver Palm (Amtrak)|Silver Palm]]''. Service on the ''Silver Palm'' was cut back to [[Savannah, Georgia]] in 2002. The ''Sunset Limited'' route was truncated at [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]] as a result of the track damage in the Gulf Coast area caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]] on August 28, 2005. Service was restored as far east as [[New Orleans]] by late October 2005, but Amtrak has opted not to fully restore service into Florida.

Jacksonville is the headquarters of two significant freight railroads. [[CSX Transportation]], owns a large building on the downtown riverbank that is a significant part of the skyline. [[Florida East Coast Railway]] and [[RailAmerica]] also call Jacksonville home.

====Airports====

{{main|Jacksonville Aviation Authority}}
[[File:Jacksonville Int'l.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Jacksonville International Airport]]]]
Jacksonville is served by [[Jacksonville International Airport]] {{airport codes|JAX|KJAX|JAX}}, {{Convert|13|mi}} north of downtown, with 82 departures a day to 27 nonstop destination cities. Airports in Jacksonville are managed by the [[Jacksonville Aviation Authority]] (JAA). Smaller aircraft use [[Jacksonville Executive at Craig Airport]] {{Airport codes|CRG|KCRG|CRG}} in Arlington, [[Herlong Recreational Airport]] {{airport codes||KHEG|HEG}} on the Westside, and [[Cecil Airport]] {{airport codes|VQQ|KVQQ|VQQ}}, at [[Cecil Commerce Center]]. The state of Florida has designated Cecil Airport a space port, allowing horizontal lift spacecraft to use the facility.

====Seaports====

{{main|Jacksonville Port Authority}}
Public seaports in Jacksonville are managed by the [[Jacksonville Port Authority]], known as JAXPORT. Four modern deepwater ({{Convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=semicolon}}) seaport facilities, including America's newest cruise port, make Jacksonville a full-service international seaport. In FY2006, JAXPORT handled 8.7&nbsp;million tons of cargo, including nearly 610,000 vehicles, which ranks Jacksonville second in the nation in automobile handling, behind only the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/data/session/2002/House/bills/analysis/pdf/2002h0945.tr.pdf |title=The Florida Legislature Archive: BILL# HB945 RELATING TO the Jacksonville Seaport Authority |access-date=July 1, 2010}}</ref>

The 20 other maritime facilities not managed by the Port Authority move about 10 million tons of additional cargo in and out of the St. Johns River. In terms of total tonnage, the Port of Jacksonville ranks 40th nationally; within Florida, it is third behind Tampa and Port Everglades.

In 2003, the [[JAXPORT Cruise Terminal]] opened, providing cruise service for 1,500 passengers to [[Key West, Florida]], the [[Bahamas]], and Mexico via [[Carnival Cruise Lines]] ship ''[[Grand Celebration|Celebration]]'', which was retired in April 2008. For almost five months, no cruises originated from Jacksonville until September 20, 2008, when the cruise ship ''[[Carnival Fascination|Fascination]]'' departed with 2,079 passengers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wells|first= Judy|url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/092108/met_334781617.shtml|title= Florida Times-Union, September 21, 2008, Fascination to write home about}}</ref> In fiscal year 2006, there were 78 cruise ship sailings with 128,745 passengers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaxport.com/ |title=The Jacksonville Port Authority |publisher=Jaxport |access-date=July 1, 2010}}</ref> A JaxPort spokesperson said in 2008 that they expect 170,000 passengers to sail each year.<ref>Turner, Kevin: [http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/091908/bus_333991407.shtml Florida Times-Union, September 19, 2008, "Carnival back with bigger, better ship, the Fascination"]</ref>

Often this individual is different from the officer assigned to coordinate fire attack.  Though not required in all cases—mainly because fireboat vary in size—most fireboat captains are certified/licensed through the United States Coast Guard for operations of a vessel up to 100 tons. In some jurisdictions, such as Jacksonville, Florida, all crew members are required to be USCG-licensed regardless of what position they are assigned on the boat.}}</ref>

The [[Mayport Ferry]] connects the north and south ends of State Road A1A between Mayport and Fort George Island, and is the last active ferry in Florida. The state of Florida transferred responsibility for ferry operations to JAXPORT on October 1, 2007.

===Utilities===

{{main|Jacksonville Electric Authority}}
[[File:JEAHQ.jpeg|thumb|right|[[JEA]] headquarters in [[downtown Jacksonville]]]]
Basic utilities in Jacksonville (water, sewer, electric) are provided by [[JEA]] (formerly the Jacksonville Electric Authority). According to Article 21 of the ''Jacksonville City Charter'':

<blockquote>JEA is authorized to own, manage and operate a utilities system within and outside the City of Jacksonville. JEA is created for the express purpose of acquiring, constructing, operating, financing and otherwise have plenary authority with respect to electric, water, sewer, natural gas and such other utility systems as may be under its control now or in the future.<ref>[http://library.municode.com/HTML/12174/level3/CHRELA_PTACHLACHJAFL_ART21JE.html "Article 21. -JEA"] Municode website, Jacksonville City Charter</ref></blockquote>

[[TECO Energy|People's Gas]] is Jacksonville's natural gas provider. [[Comcast]] is Jacksonville's local cable provider. [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] (formerly [[BellSouth]]) is Jacksonville's local phone provider, and their [[U-Verse]] service offers TV, internet, and VoIP phone service to customers served by fiber-to-the-premises or fiber-to-the-node using a [[Video ready access device|VRAD]]. The city has a successful recycling program with separate pickups for garbage, [[Green waste|yard waste]] and recycling. Collection is provided by several private companies under contract to the City of Jacksonville.

===Health===

{{Further|List of hospitals in Florida}}
Major players in the Jacksonville health care industry include [[St. Vincent's HealthCare]], [[Baptist Health (Jacksonville)|Baptist Health]] and [[UF Health Jacksonville]] for local residents. Additionally, [[Nemours Foundation|Nemours Children's Clinic]] and [[Mayo Clinic Jacksonville]] each draw patients regionally.

The TaxExemptWorld.com website, which compiles [[Internal Revenue Service]] data, reported that in 2007, there are 2,910 distinct, active, tax exempt/non-profit organizations in Jacksonville which, excluding Credit Unions, had a total income of $7.08&nbsp;billion and assets of $9.54&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taxexemptworld.com/search.asp?pg=91&type=os&criteria=FL&rc=4198&ra=&ri=&re=&prevpage=90&city=Jacksonville|title=Nonprofit Organization & 501C3 Lookup by City – TaxExemptWorld|website=www.taxexemptworld.com}}</ref>
There are 333 charitable organizations with assets of over $1&nbsp;million. The largest share of assets was tied to Medical facilities, $4.5&nbsp;billion. The problems of the homeless are addressed by several non-profits, most notably the [[Sulzbacher Center]] and the [[Clara White Mission]].
