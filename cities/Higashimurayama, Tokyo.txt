==History==
The area of present-day Higashimurayama has been inhabited since [[Japanese Paleolithic]] times, and numerous remains from the [[Jōmon period|Jōmon]], [[Yayoi period|Yayoi]] and [[Kofun period|Kofun]] periods have been discovered. During the [[Nara period]], it became part of ancient [[Musashi Province]]. During the [[Kamakura period]], it was the location of the [[Battle of Kumegawa]] in 1333.

In the post-[[Meiji Restoration]] cadastral reform of April 1, 1889, several villages merged to form Higashimurayama Village in Kitatama District, at that time part of [[Kanagawa Prefecture]]. The entire district was transferred to the control of Tokyo Prefecture(東京府) on April 1, 1893. On April 1, 1942, Higashimurayama Village became the town of Higashimurayama. On April 1, 1964, Higashimurayama was elevated to city status.

==Government==
