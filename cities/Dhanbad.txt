The present district used to be a part of [[Manbhum]] region and was occupied by Mundari tribals in the wilderness of South undivided [[Bihar]]. In the seventh century A.D. some information is available from the account of the travels of [[Hieun Tsang]]. These accounts narrate the existence of a powerful kingdom which comprised the district and adjoining areas, ruled by [[Sasanka]].<ref>{{cite web|title=DHANBAD DISTRICT OVERVIEW |url=http://dhanbad.nic.in/administration/block/dhanbad.htm |access-date=6 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317061341/http://dhanbad.nic.in/administration/block/dhanbad.htm |archive-date=17 March 2011 }}</ref> Manbhum was one of the districts of the [[East India]] during the [[British Raj]].

The region has thick forests, with rich mineral resources, and had a mixed demographic profile with people from different religious and [[social group]]s, including [[adivasi]]s, particularly the [[Santal]]s and the [[Munda people|Mundas]] before the city was established.<ref name=brit/> After the [[Partition of India]], the district became a part of [[Bihar]] state, and upon re-organization of the Indian states in the mid-1950s, the district became a part of the [[West Bengal]]. [[Purulia district]] was carved out of the district of Manbhum.<ref name=brit>Encyclopædia Britannica, Eleventh Edition, a publication now in the public domain</ref>

In the Settlement Report for Manbhum (1928) it was stated that no rock inscriptions, copper plates or old coins were discovered and not a single document of copper plate or palm leaf was found, during the Survey and Settlement operations. The oldest authentic documents produced were all on paper and barely even a hundred years old.<ref name="indiatravelite1">[http://www.indiatravelite.com/Bihar/dhanbadintroduction.htm Dhanbad Introduction/Jharkhand-Dhanbad Sightseeing-Dhanbad Jharkhand Transport-Places of Interest in Dhanbad] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313142257/http://www.indiatravelite.com/Bihar/dhanbadintroduction.htm |date=13 March 2009 }}.

This was done under the commitment and leadership of journalist, Satish Chandra. In the year 2006, Dhanbad celebrated 50 years of being an independent district and city.
