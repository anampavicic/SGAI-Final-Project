==Etymology and legend==
In Hinduism, [[Parvati]], wife of [[Shiva]], once closed the eyes of her husband playfully in a flower garden at their abode atop [[Mount Kailash]]. Although only a moment for the gods, all light was taken from the universe, and the earth, in turn, was submerged in darkness for years. Parvati performed penance with other devotees of Shiva, and her husband appeared as a big column of fire at the top of [[Arunachala|Annamalai hills]], returning light to the world.<ref name="Hunter"/> He then merged with Parvati to form [[Ardhanarishvara]], the half-female, half-male form of Shiva.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kingsbury |first=Francis |author2=Godfrey Edward Phillips  |title=Hymns of the Tamil Śaivite saints |year=1921|page=13 |publisher=Bishop of Dornakal |location=New York }}</ref> The Annamalai, or red mountain, lies behind the Annamalaiyar temple, and is associated with the temple of its namesake.<ref name="abram">{{Cite book |last=Abram |first=David |author2=Nick Edwards |author3=Mike Ford |author4=Daniel Jacobs |author5=Shafik Meghji |author6=Devdan Sen |author7=Gavin Thomas  |title=The Rough guide to India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sEhJBfbhTAAC&q=tiruvannamalai&pg=PA542 |year=2011 |publisher=Rough Guides |isbn=978-1-84836-563-6| page= 456}}</ref> The hill is sacred and considered a ''[[lingam]]'', or iconic representation of Shiva, in itself.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Goodman |first=Martin |title=On Sacred Mountains |year=2002 |publisher=Heart of Albion Press |location=UK |isbn=1-872883-58-3| pages= 38–39}}</ref>
Another legend is that once, while [[Vishnu]] and [[Brahma]] contested for superiority, Shiva appeared as a flame, and challenged them to find his source.<ref name="Aiyar"/><ref name="history"/> Brahma took the form of a swan, and flew to the sky to see the top of the flame, while Vishnu became the boar [[Varaha]], and sought its base. The scene is called ''lingothbava'', and is represented in the western wall at the sanctum of most Shiva temples. Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he had found the pinnacle. In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship.<ref name="Aiyar"/> In Tamil, the word ''Arunam'' means red or fire and ''Asalam'' means hill. Since Shiva manifested himself in the form of fire in this place, this name Arunachalam came to be associated with Annamalai hill and the city.<ref name="history"/> The first mention of ''Annamalai'' is found in ''[[Tevaram]]'', the seventh century Tamil Saiva canonical work by [[Appar]] and [[Sambandar|Tirugnanasambandar]].<ref name="thirukoil"/>

During the 18th century, Tiruvannamalai came under the dominion of the [[Nawab of the Carnatic]]. As the [[Mughal empire]] came to an end, the Nawab lost control of the city, with confusion and chaos ensuing after 1753.<ref name="Hunter"/> Subsequently, there were periods of both Hindu and Muslim stewardship of the temple, with Muraru Raya, Krishna Raya, Mrithis Ali Khan, and Burkat Ullakhan besieging the temple in succession. As European incursions progressed, Tiruvannamalai was attacked by French Soupries, Sambrinet, and the English [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] Stephen Smith. While some were repelled, others were victorious. The French occupied the city in 1757 and it came under the control of the British in 1760.<ref name="Aiyar"/> In 1790, Tiruvannamalai city was captured by [[Tippu Sultan]], who ruled from 1782 to 1799.<ref name="Hunter">{{Cite book|last=Hunter |first=Sir William|title=Imperial gazetteer of India: Provincial series, Volume 18 |year=1908 |publisher=Superintendent of Government Printing |location=Calcutta |pages= 129–130}}</ref> During the first half of the 19th century, the city came under [[British rule in India|British rule]].<ref name="Aiyar"/>
