'''Mangystau Region''' ({{lang-kk|Маңғыстау облысы|Mañğystau oblysy}}), formerly known as '''Mangyshlak Region''' ([[Russian language|Russian:]] {{Lang|RU| Мангышлак область}}) from 1973 until 1988, is a [[Regions of Kazakhstan|region]] of [[Kazakhstan]]. Its capital is [[Aqtau]] (a seaport), which has a population of 183,350 (2017);<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stat.gov.kz/getImg?id=ESTAT230041 |title=Об изменении численности населения Мангистауской области с начала 2017 года до 1 июля 2017 года |date=2017-08-10 |website=Департамент статистики Мангистауской области |format=doc |access-date=2018-01-03}}</ref> the entire Mangystau Province has a population of 745,909 (2022).<ref name="stat1">{{Cite web|title=Об изменении численности населения Республики Казахстан с начала 2020 года по 1 ноября 2021 года|url=https://stat.gov.kz/api/getFile/?docId=ESTAT334818|access-date=2022-01-04|publisher=Комитет по статистике Министерства национальной экономики Республики Казахстан}}</ref>

==Geography==
The region is located in the southwest of the country, and includes [[Mangyshlak Peninsula]]. It has much of Kazakhstan's [[Caspian Sea|Caspian Shore]]. It also borders neighboring countries [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]. Mangystau also borders two other Kazakh regions (counter-clockwise), [[Aktobe Region]] and [[Atyrau Region]]. The area of the region is 165,600 square kilometers. Engineers discovered petroleum in the area in the days of the [[Soviet Union]], drilling commenced, and much of the area was built up around the industry.
[[File:Конкреции в Западном Казахстане. Concretions. Western Kazakhstan.JPG|thumb|[[Torysh|The Valley of Balls]]]]
The territory of Mangystau includes varied landscapes and desert lands: Caspian lowland, plateaus (Usturt, Mangyshlak, Kendirli-Kayasan), mountains (Aktau, Karatau), cavities, desert, mountains and mountain ridges. That kind of landscape forms an original multigraded labyrinth, painted with green, yellow, pink and red sediment of loam. The highest point is Otpan mountain at {{convert|556|m}}. The lowest point is the [[Caspian Depression|bottom of Karagie cavity]], {{convert|132|m}} below sea level.

== Climate ==
[[File:Horses in Mangystau Province, Kazakhstan.jpg|thumb|right|Mangystau Region in winter time]]
The region has a wide variety of climate conditions. North Mangystau is cold in winter due to the [[Ustyurt Plateau]], the location of the plateau being mainly above sea level. On the whole, the climate is continental with cold winters and mild summers. The average temperature is {{convert|-3|°C}} in January and {{convert|+26|°C}} in July. The average annual rainfall is {{convert|150|mm}}.

== Paleontology ==
[[Fossil]]s of marine animals are known from the Late [[Cretaceous]] (probably Upper [[Cenomanian]]-[[Turonian]]) deposits of the southern part of the Mangyshlak Plateau.<ref name=Averianov2001/> Found specimens are a [[Dolichosauridae|dolichosaurian]] thoracic vertebra and teeth of [[Chondrichthyes|chondrichthyians]]: [[Hybodontiformes|hybodontiform]] ''[[Ptychodus]]'' and [[Lamniformes|lamniform]] ''[[Protolamna]]'', ''[[Cretolamna]]'', ''[[Cretoxyrhina]]'' and ''[[Hispidaspis]]''.<ref name=Averianov2001/> These fishes were mainly [[pelagic fish|pelagic]] forms, which confirms the deep-sea nature of the ecosystem represented.<ref name=Averianov2001>{{cite journal|author=A.

The first written sources on Mangystau Region date back to the 9th century AD.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} According to Arabic geographers, it was uninhabited until the tenth century when groups opposing the Turkmen Oghuz settled and found sources of water and grassland. The mountain called Binkishlah (unidentified) would have marked the border between [[Khwarezm]] and the Khanate of the [[Khazars]]. These Turkmen were vassals of the Khazars, at the beginning of the thirteenth century when Yaqut al-Hamawi and Ibn al-Athir mention{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} the name of Mankashlagh. Ibn al-Athir tells of a Turkish principality with a medina with the same name as the territory that existed from the late eleventh century. In 1097 a struggle between Kutb al-Din Muhammad, Khwarezm governor of Seljuks and Tugrul Tehghin occurred. In 1127, [[Atsiz]] occupied the whole peninsula. During [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarezmshah]] rule, it was part of firstly [[Gorgan]] province, later [[Mazandaran Province]].

In 1221, the Mongols occupied it. It was later passed to successively [[Golden Horde]], [[Nogai Horde]], [[Uzbek Khanate]] and [[Kazakh Khanate]], but its population  decreased after gradual drying of the steppe and [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk]] raids began in 1620. Some Salur and Ersari Turkmens left the region and migrated to Russia.

In 1670, Anusha Khan who was the khan of Khiva asked the Russian government to build a fortress to protect the peninsula for securing trade between Russia and Khwarezm. Puntsuk Monchak and Ayuka (1670-1724) deported most of the Cawdor and Igdir groups of Turkmenistan to the Volga basin. For protecting trade, Anusha Khan annexed it to his territories in 1676 and built a fort at the port of Karagan in 1687.

The Russians under Peter the Great sent an expedition led by the unfortunate [[Alexander Bekovich-Cherkassky|Bekovich-Cherkassky]], who established three forts on the coast of the Caspian Sea, but they were abandoned after one year. Then there were several Russian scientific expeditions. In 1834 they founded on the south coast of the Bay of Mertviy Kultuk a permanent garrison at Novo-Petrovskoye. This caused a conflict with the Khan of Khiva and an abortive military campaign between 1839 and 1840. During this period, the Bayuli tribe of the Kazakhs settled and the remaining Turkmens left it in 1840 except a group of families of the Cawdor tribe.

The peninsula was subject to conflict between Khiva and Russia; each party wanted to have the Kazakhs. In 1846, the Russians built a fort in Karagan named Novo-Petrovskoye that in 1859 was renamed Fort Alexandrovskiy. Russian domination of it began with the occupation of [[Krasnovodsk]], located in the southern part of it in 1869. At the same time, Russians established Mangyshlak district which was subordinated to the Viceroyalty of Caucasus. The Khanate of Khiva renounced possession of this peninsula in favor of the Russians in 1873. It was attached to Russia as an uyezd of [[Transcaspian Oblast]] in 1881.

The fate of the government following the 1917 revolution was in the hands of the Mensheviks. After the [[October Revolution]] the Bolsheviks prevailed but were eliminated by British intervention in June 1918. On July 12, 1918, an Interim Executive Committee, which sought to restore [[Alexander Kerensky]], was established in [[Ashgabat]]. Bolsheviks took the region in February 1920. On August 26, 1920, the peninsula was included in the Kyrgyz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic within the Russian Soviet Socialist Federative Republic. On June 15, 1925, it was renamed the Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, all within the Russian RFSS. On December 5, 1936, it was elevated to Kazakh SSR, but a narrow strip of the southern coastal bay fronting Kara Boghaz was ceded to [[Turkmen SSR]] at the same time.

In 1937, this peninsula became part of [[Atyrau Region|Gur'yev Oblast]] with the Kazakh part of [[Ustyurt Plateau]], and a new department{{clarify|date=March 2017}} was formed with its capital Fort-Shevchenko.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Its current capital was founded as Shevchenko in 1964.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} In 1973, the area split from Gur’yev oblast and was named Mangyshlak Oblast. This earlier version of the region was liquidated in 1988 but was restored in 1990 with the new name, Mangystau Oblast. After the independence of Kazakhstan, its capital was renamed from Shevchenko to Aqtau.

==Administrative divisions==
The region is administratively divided into five districts and two cities of regional significance: [[Aqtau]] and [[Zhanaozen]]. The districts<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mangystau.kz/data.php?n_id=2984&l=ru|script-title=ru:Список телефонов акимов городов и районов Мангистауской области и их заместителей|publisher=Акимат Мангистауской области|language=ru|access-date=3 June 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130218220512/http://www.mangystau.kz/data.php?n_id=2984&l=ru|archive-date=18 February 2013}}</ref> with their populations<ref>Agency of Statistics of the Republic of Kazakhstan.</ref> are:
