'''Barranquilla''' ({{IPA|es-419|baraŋˈkiʝa|latam|Barranquilla1.ogg}}) is the capital district of the [[Atlántico department]] in [[Colombia]]. It is located near the [[Caribbean Sea]] and is the largest city and third port<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.supertransporte.gov.co/documentos/2020/Febrero/Puertos_07/BOLETIN-TRAFICO-PORTUARIO-2019.pdf | title= BOLETÍN ESTADÍSTICO TRÁFICO PORTUARIO EN COLOMBIA Año 2019 | department=[[:es:Superintendencia (Colombia) | Superintendencia de Transporte]] |  website=supertransporte.gov.co | orig-date=February 2020 | pages=46}} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210304052516/https://www.supertransporte.gov.co/documentos/2020/Febrero/Puertos_07/BOLETIN-TRAFICO-PORTUARIO-2019.pdf |date=March 4, 2021 }}</ref> in the [[Caribbean region of Colombia|Caribbean coast region]]; as of 2018, it had a population of 1,206,319<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://population.city/colombia/barranquilla/ |title=Barranquilla · Population |access-date=November 21, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201032037/http://population.city/colombia/barranquilla/ |archive-date=December 1, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="dane.gov.co"/> making it [[List of cities in Colombia by population|Colombia's fourth-most populous city]] after [[Bogotá]], [[Medellín]], and [[Cali]].

Barranquilla lies strategically next to the delta of the [[Magdalena River]], {{cvt|7.5|km|1|abbr=off}} (originally {{cvt|25|km|0|abbr=off}} before rapid urban growth) from its mouth at the Caribbean Sea, serving as a port for river and maritime transportation within Colombia. It is also the main economic center of the [[Atlántico (Colombia)|Atlántico]] department in Colombia. The city is the core of the [[Metropolitan Area of Barranquilla|Barranquilla metropolitan area]], with a population of over 2 million, which also includes the municipalities of [[Soledad, Atlántico|Soledad]], [[Galapa, Atlántico|Galapa]], [[Malambo, Atlántico|Malambo]], and [[Puerto Colombia]].

Barranquilla was legally established as a town on April 7, 1813, although it dates from at least 1629. It grew into an important port, serving as a haven for immigrants from Europe, especially during and immediately following World War I and World War II, when waves of additional immigrants from the Middle East and Asia arrived. Barranquilla became Colombia's main port, and with its level of industrialization and modernity, it earned the nickname "Colombia's Golden Gate" (Spanish: ''La Puerta de Oro de Colombia''). In the 1940s, Barranquilla was the second-largest city in Colombia and one of the most modern cities in the Caribbean and in South America; later local administrations, due to widespread corruption in their ranks, brought about a decline in the standard of living. As government investment increased in other Colombian cities, Barranquilla's national position was eclipsed.

Barranquilla has hosted the [[2018 Central American and Caribbean Games]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cali |first=Casa Editorial El País |title=¡Gran noticia!

[[Ernesto Cortissoz International Airport]], built in Barranquilla in 1919, was the first airport in South America. The city is served by domestic and international flights and was [[Avianca|Avianca's]] first hub.

==Etymology==
[[File:Barranquilla Edificio Administración Aduana.jpg|thumb|left|Old customs administration building in Barranquilla]]

Barranquilla's name refers to the canyons that existed in the area adjacent to the Magdalena, where the city arose. During the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]], the name "barranca" was common in coastal communities ([[Barrancabermeja]], Barranca Nueva, Barranca Vieja, etc.). This name was probably derived from an alteration of Aragon.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ropaín De León |first=Claudio |title=Barranquilla, incógnita de un nombre. En: Revista Olas |year=1985}}</ref> During Spanish colonization, the area was known as [[Camacho]] or Kamash Indian Site, and San Nicolás de la Barranquilla (patron saint of [[San Nicolás de Tolentino]]) began to develop the area with the estates of Barrancas de Camacho, Barrancas de San Nicolás, Barranquilla de Camacho, and Barranquilla de San Nicolás, from which the city name is derived.<ref name="tierradentro">{{cite book |author=Blanco Barros |first=José Agustín |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X_VrAAAAMAAJ |title=El Norte de Tierradentro y los orígenes de Barranquilla |publisher=Banco de la República |year=1987 |isbn=958-9028-39-X |pages=13–57 |access-date=January 27, 2022 |archive-date=October 13, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221013162622/https://www.google.com/books/edition/El_norte_de_Tierradentro_y_los_or%C3%ADgenes/X_VrAAAAMAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Nicknames===
In 1921, President [[Marco Fidel Suárez]] called the city the ''Puerta de Oro de la República'' (Golden Gate of the Republic) in recognition of its economic importance as a port since the late 19th century. In 1946, opening the 5th Central American and Caribbean Games, President [[Mariano Ospina Pérez]] reaffirmed the nickname of the city as the "Golden Gate".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://museo.uninorte.edu.co/bienvenidos.html |title=Puerta de Oro |access-date=April 19, 2011 |publisher=Campo Elías Romero Fuenmayor, Museo de Estética Virtual.

;Flag
In 1811, the patriots who obtained the independence of the Cartagenas adopted the current flag. It consists of three rectangles, red being the outermost, then yellow, and green in the center. Red symbolizes the blood of patriots; yellow, the sun of freedom and hope; and green, a proud home. In the centre, there is an eight-pointed silver star, which symbolizes the eight provinces of the confederacy. The flag was carried by [[Simon Bolívar]] during the campaign of Lower Magdalena in 1812. In 1814, the Congress of Tunja adopted it as the emblem of the [[United Provinces of New Granada]]. In 1910, the Council approved the flag for Barranquilla.<ref name="simbolalc">{{cite web |url=http://www.alcaldiabarranquilla.gov.co/barranquilla_simbolos.asp |title=Conoce a Barranquilla.

== History ==
{{Moresources|section|date=July 2023}}
=== Origins and colonial era ===
Unlike other cities in Colombia such as [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] or [[Bogotá D.C.]], Barranquilla was not founded during the Spanish colonial period and it was not founded on a pre-Columbian site. The first mention of the current territory of Barranquilla dates back to 1533 and was written by [[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés]].<ref name="MertinsDurán2008">{{cite book |last1=Mertins |first1=Günter |last2=Durán |first2=Adrián Vergara |title=Renovación de centros históricos en grandes ciudades latinoamericanas: repercusiones socioeconómicas, urbanístico-estructurales y medioambientales-urbanas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=599zRK_ojlQC&pg=PA245 |access-date=April 19, 2011 |year=2008 |publisher=Universidad del Norte |isbn=978-958-8252-69-8 |page=245 |language=es|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405092907/http://books.google.com/books?id=599zRK_ojlQC&pg=PA245|archive-date=April 5, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> He describes the route of [[Pedro de Heredia]], founder of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], just weeks before he founded that city, and says that this was a point of landing of canoes for the Indians of Santa Marta within the interior.

Barranquilla is honored as the origination of the aviation and airport. The first airline in South America was born in Barranquilla with the name of SCADTA which is today [[Avianca]].

The home location of the Kamash indios (hispanized to ''Camacho'' or ''Camach'') is known as the first permanent human settlement of Barranquilla. During the 16th century, an ''[[encomienda]]'' of captain Domingo de Santa Cruz was established, granted by the Spanish crown for his notable military performance. This ''encomienda'' disappeared in 1559, when it was in the hands of señora Ana Ximénez, widow of Santa Cruz, after the death of her husband. She became the victim of a disregardful violent act by the second ''encomendero'' of [[Galapa, Colombia|Galapa]], Don Pedro de Barros I, when he arbitrarily grabbed all the Camacho population that could offer labour and took them to his ''encomienda''.
[[File:Placa-fundacion-barranquilla.jpg|thumb|Plaque marking the block where people began to populate Barranquilla]]
Between 1627 and 1637, Hacienda San Nicolás de Tolentino was founded by Nicolás de Barros, great-grandson of Don Pedro de Barros I. The farm was established on the banks of the river channel. The original property area was {{cvt|24.78|km2}}. Pedro Vasquez Buezo expanded the property to {{cvt|41.3|km2}}. On this estate, Barros allowed his workers to build their homes and support their families, which helped further develop his field operations. After the death of Barros, the estate began to accommodate others, such as people who for reasons of health, age or cronyism with the hacienda owner were allowed to stay. There were also Indians from [[Malambo, Colombia|Malambo]] and [[Galapa, Colombia|Galapa]]. By 1681, the ranch was considered a village, known as Barrancas de San Nicolas. Before 1700, Barranquilla was occupied by Aguerra of [[Tierradentro]] and in 1772, the township was expanded by the same group, adding a Judge Counsel.<ref name="geoatlantico1909">{{cite book |last=REVOLLO |first=Andrés M. B. |publisher=Gobernación del Atlántico |title=Geografía del departamento del Atlántico en 1909 |year=1909 |page=104 |location=Provincia de Barranquilla}}</ref>

The origin of Barranquilla, promoted in the second half of the 19th century by the historian Domingo Malabet, was not supported by oral tradition nor scientifically validated. Blanco Barros' 1987 book on Northern Tierradentro and the origins of Barranquilla argued that the city had been founded by farmers from the neighboring town of Galapa who left their land, following their herds to the Magdalena River.<ref name="tierradentro"/>

===Era of Independence (1810–1823)===
[[File:Lacorazza.jpg|thumb|Casa Lacorazza, Saint Nicolas square.]]
In the era of the [[Bolívar's campaign to liberate New Granada|Colombian War of Independence]], Barranquilla distinguished itself as a supporter of the pro-independence forces. In 1812, General [[Pierre Labatut]] attacked and defeated royalist forces at Sitioviejo and Sitionuevo. On April 7, 1813, which was later celebrated as "Barranquilla Day" ("el Día de Barranquilla"), the President-Governor of the Free and Independent State of Cartagena de Indias, [[Manuel Rodríguez Torices]], granted the title of "villa" to the town, thereby allowing it to benefit from certain privileges, and making it the capital of the department of [[Barlovento, Colombia|Barlovento]] (or Tierradentro), in recognition for the valor and patriotism displayed by the town for its defense of the pro-independence city of Cartagena de Indias against the royalist stronghold of Santa Marta.

In 1815, Joaquín Vallejo, a rich merchant, maintained a pro-independence battalion for three months at his own expense. When the Spanish forces under Colonel Valentín Capmani approached Barranquilla, its inhabitants resisted Capmani but were defeated on April 25, 1815. The population of the town was attacked and taken prisoner by the royalist troops, which also defeated Vallejo's pro-independence battalion. In the following 5–6 years, Barranquilla was a center for republican military operations.<ref name="geoatlantico1909"/> On October 10, 1821, the last royalist stronghold at Cartagena was defeated. At that time, Cartagena was capital of the [[Sovereign State of Bolivar]], to which Barranquilla belonged. In the same year, Barranquilla was governed by its very first mayor, Agustín Del Valle, who carried out his duties from his own home, which later was converted in a military headquarters. On July 24, 1823, the naval [[Battle of Lake Maracaibo]] took place, which resulted in the final expulsion of Spanish royalist forces from Gran Colombia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elheraldo.com.co/ELHERALDO/BancoConocimiento/W/w3columconstruyendo/w3columconstruyendo.asp |title=Construyendo el Caribe colombiano |access-date=October 27, 2008 |publisher=El Heraldo |last=Weildler |first=Guerra |language=es}}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

=== Republican Period ===
[[File:Bquilla - 17 ago 2007 081.jpg|thumb|Obelisk in honor of Juan B. Elbers.]]

====19th century====
The geographic area of Barranquilla did not include mineral or natural riches, and thus did not serve as a location where the Spanish maintained a permanent presence. Its importance was not appreciated until the mid-19th century, due to the introduction of [[steamships]] that navigated the [[Magdalena River]] by the German Juan Bernardo Elbers on behalf of Simón Bolívar at the founding of Gran Colombia in 1823. The route was opened on November 10, 1825.<ref>{{cite book |last=GOENAGA |first=Miguel |publisher=Imprenta Departamental |title=Lecturas locales |year=1953 |location=Barranquilla |page=230}}</ref> Barranquilla thus initiated a lively exchange of goods with cities and towns of the Colombian interior, as well as with international merchants, and it became a principal port for the export of coffee.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/historia/docpais/barcos.doc |title=Decreto Que Concede a Juan Bernardo Elbers Privilegio Exclusivo para Establecer Buques de Vapor en el Río de Magdalena. |access-date=August 9, 2008 |publisher=Biblioteca Luis Ángel Arango |language=es |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626121410/http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/historia/docpais/barcos.doc |archive-date=June 26, 2007 |df=mdy}}</ref> With the establishment of the new nation of the [[Republic of New Granada]] in 1831, two revolutions began in Barranquilla.

On January 25, 1861, General [[Juan José Nieto Gil]], president of the State of Bolívar, launched a rebellion from Barranquilla. Barranquilla became the capital of a province of the same name by law on December 26, 1862, and the Sovereign State of Bolívar was divided into 12 provinces. At the establishment of the United States of Colombia, the growing commercial importance of Barranquilla led to the construction, between 1869 and 1871, of the Bolívar Railway (''Ferrocarril de Bolívar''), the first railway of the present-day Republic of Colombia. It linked Barranquilla and Sabanilla (Salgar), the latter being the location of the customs house.

As part of the country's restructuring, President General [[Rafael Reyes]], of the National Constituent and Legislative Assembly, through Act April 17, 11, 1905 created the Atlántico department, consisting of the provinces of Barranquilla and Sabanalarga, the department of Bolivar, and Barranquilla as the capital. However, in 1908, Atlántico department was changed to the Department of Barranquilla by Act 1. With the fall of General Reyes in 1909, the Department of Barranquilla was abolished by Act 65 of that year, with Barranquilla again integrating into the department of Bolivar. The National Constituent Assembly of 1910 enacted Law 21 on July 14, which definitively established the Department of Atlántico with Barranquilla again as capital.<ref name="histatl"/>

The main river is the Magdalena River; other rivers include the Arriba, Los Tramposos, La Ahuyama, La Tablaza and Las Compañías; streams run through the ''[[barrio]]s'' of Rebolo, Santo Domingo, Las Américas y el Bosque; El Lindero, El Platanal, El Salado, El Salado 2, Don Juan, Hospital, La Paz, Bolívar, Felicidad, Coltabaco, Siape, Calle 92, and the streets 8, 15, 19, 51, 53, 58, 65 and 71.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arroyosdebarranquilla.org/geografia/hidrologia.htm |title=Hidrología |access-date=April 19, 2011 |publisher=Arroyos de Barranquilla |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080713041612/http://www.arroyosdebarranquilla.org/geografia/hidrologia.htm |archive-date=July 13, 2008 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> There are also the marshes of [[Mallorquín Swamp]].

The geological composition of the region is the [[Tertiary period]] (''[[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]]'') in western hills and [[Quaternary]] (''[[Pleistocene]] and [[Holocene]]'') in the flatter, like the sole of river.

=== Climate ===
Barranquilla has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Aw''); it is hot all-year-round, with high levels of [[relative humidity]]. The average temperature is {{cvt|28.4|°C|°F|1|disp=or}}.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Laboratory of Climatology (C.W. Thornthwaite Associates) |title=Publications in climatology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LFocAQAAMAAJ |access-date=April 19, 2011 |year=1981|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405092932/http://books.google.com/books?id=LFocAQAAMAAJ|archive-date=April 5, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> Daytime temperatures usually remain around {{cvt|32|°C|°F|1|disp=or}}. Nevertheless, from late November to early April, [[trade wind]]s more or less cool it to a more comfortable temperature during daylight. During the evening and through the night, temperature can change due to the strong winds it receives. Rainy seasons are from April to June and from August to November, when some streets flood producing "arroyos" (streams) that can be very dangerous, given the lack of appropriate rain drainage in some sectors of town.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lévine |first=V. |title=Colombia: physical features, natural resources, means of communication, manufactures and industrial development |url=https://archive.org/details/colombiaphysical00lvin |access-date=April 19, 2011 |year=1920 |publisher=D.

[[File:28 feb 08 003.jpg|thumb|left|[[Iguana]] in the area around Hotel El Prado]]

According to the Agustín Codazzi Geographic Institute ([[Instituto Geográfico Agustín Codazzi]]), Barranquilla has a dry tropical forest vegetation (according to the [[Holdridge life zones]]), which includes species including [[cacti]], [[mangroves]], ''[[Acanthocereus]]'', ''[[Prosopis juliflora]]'', [[divi-divi]], ''[[Tabebuia rosea]]'', and [[Delonix regia|flamboyant or flame tree]].

In the fertile lands watered by the Magdalena River, one can find species such as ''[[Eichhornia azurea]]'', ''[[Typha angustifolia]]'', ''[[Heliconia]]'', ''[[Eichhornia crassipes]]'', ''[[Anacardium excelsum]]'', and ''[[Lecythis minor]]''.

Found in urban areas are such tree species as ''[[Gliricidia sepium]]'', ''[[Cassia nodosa]]'', ''[[Bursera simaruba]]'', ''[[Terminalia catappa]]'', ''[[Casuarina equisetifolia]]'', and species of ''[[Ceiba]]'' such as ''[[Ceiba pentandra]]'', ''[[Hura crepitans]]'' and ''[[Ficus elastica]]'', ''[[Ochroma pyramidale]]'',  ''[[Licania tomentosa]]'', ''[[Ficus religiosa]]'', ''[[Ficus benghalensis]]'', ''[[Spathodea campanulata]]'', ''[[Enterolobium cyclocarpum]]'', ''[[Samanea saman]]'', ''[[Gmelina arborea]]'', ''[[Ficus nitida]]'', ''[[Cordia sebestena]]'', ''[[Tabebuia chrysantha]]'', ''[[Kigelia pinnata]]'', ''[[Swietenia macrophylla]]'', ''[[Thespesia populnea]]'', ''[[Sterculia apetala]]'', ''[[Cocos nucifera]]'', ''[[Ficus benjamina]]'', ''[[Guazuma ulmifolia]]'', ''[[Erythrina variegata]]'', ''[[Crescentia cujete]]'', ''[[Cassia fistula]]'', ''[[Azadirachta indica]]'', ''[[Sapindus saponaria]]'' and various palms such as ''[[Roystonea regia]]'' and ''[[Phoenix roebelenii]]''.

Fruit trees in the area include ''[[Mangifera indica]]'', ''[[Manilkara zapota]]'', ''[[Melicoccus bijugatus]]'', ''[[Psidium littorale]]'', ''[[Coccoloba uvifera]]'', ''[[Ziziphus vulgaris]]'', ''[[Annona squamosa]]'', ''[[Tamarindus indica]]'', ''[[Spondias purpurea]]'', ''[[Anacardium occidentale]]'', ''[[guanábana]]'', and ''[[Citrus x limon]]''.

=== Fauna ===
Some animal species can be found in the city such as birds like [[owl]]s, [[wren]]s, and parrots; fish such as [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]] in the marshes; insects such as [[butterflies]], [[fly (insect)|flies]], [[mosquitoes]], [[gnat]]s, [[cockroach]]es and [[termites]]; mammals such as feral dogs and cats, [[monkeys]], [[rodents]] and possums (zorrochuchos); [[reptiles]] such as [[iguanas]], snakes and [[tortoises]]. In some rural areas horses, [[donkeys]], cattle, pigs and goats are raised.
<!-- [[File:zorrochucho.jpg]] -->

===Ecology and natural resources===
Barranquilla contains important ecosystems such as the Magdalena River, Mallorquín Swamp and the Eastern pipe system. The completion of the construction of embankments of Bocas de Ceniza in 1936 resulted in the deterioration of the swamp, which was originally four marshes, and led to the deterioration of the nearby beaches of Puerto Colombia.

The stream of La Victoria flows through Barranquilla Botanical Garden, a community and recreational green area for public use with an approximate area of 7 hectares, located in the southeastern part of the city, in the neighborhood of La Victoria. The lush vegetation and clear water springs have allowed a suitable habitat for rare native plant and animal species found within the city.<ref name="jardinbot">{{cite web |url=https://www.alcaldiabarranquilla.gov.co/normatividad/DECRETO%20No%200270.doc |title=DECRETO No. 0270 DE 2004.

===Environmental pollution===
;Air quality
Under wind, atmospheric pollutants move in a north and northeasterly direction, and in times of low winds or moderate winds, are more evenly distributed over the city. The most polluting industrial processes in the city are [[ammonium sulfate]], cement, [[plaster]], and paper pulp. The emission of gases from motor vehicle traffic is more critical in the central district, where much of the business is. The main source of air pollution is from the vehicles at 34% and then industry with 18%. The pollutants emitted by vehicles are [[carbon monoxide]] (89.12%), [[sulfur dioxide]] (0.23%), [[hydrocarbon]]s (6.46%), oxides of [[nitrogen]] (3.82%) and other particles (0. 37%). To help remedy this problem, several state enterprises and private sector have supported a project to convert liquid fuel vehicles to natural gas. Furthermore, the city has installed more than 12 service stations catering to natural gas vehicles. Barranquilla is the fourth-biggest atmospheric polluter from industry.<ref>{{cite book |title=LINEAMIENTOS PARA LA FORMULACIÓN DE LA POLITICA DE PREVENCIÓN Y CONTROL DE LA CONTAMINACIÓN DEL AIRE |page=April 14, 2005 |publisher=dnp.gov.co |url=http://www.dnp.gov.co/Files/documentos/Subdireccion_Conpes/3344.pdf |access-date=April 19, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312032540/http://www.dnp.gov.co/Files/documentos/Subdireccion_Conpes/3344.pdf |archive-date=March 12, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> 

According to research conducted by the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies of Colombia (IDEAM), monthly concentrations in Barranquilla of particulate matter smaller than 160 micrograms per cubic meter exceeds the highest international standard allowed of 70. The causes of this problem lie heavily with the poor quality of petrol and diesel used by vehicles in the city, with record levels of 5,000 ppm (parts per million sulfur) and 4,500 ppm respectively, when there are countries whose rates do not even exceed 50.<ref name="distrito">{{cite web |url=http://www.elheraldo.com.co/ELHERALDO/BancoConocimiento/1/10locasinequipos/10locasinequipos.asp?CodSeccion=25 |title=Distrito, sin equipos para control ambiental |access-date=April 19, 2011 |first=Carlos |last=Mancera |publisher=El Heraldo |language=es}}{{dead link |date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

;Water pollution
All of the surface water systems of Barranquilla, the Magdalena River, the Mallorquín swamp, and the system of pipes and streams in the east are subject to water pollution as well as the dumping of raw sewage and solid waste by individuals. The environmental effect has been reduced mainly on the Mallorquín swamp with the construction of ponds and the Estación Depuradora de Aguas Residuales (EDAR) by the Triple A.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://perico.aaa.com.co/portal/page/portal/Triplea/Nuestros_Servicios/EDAR |title=Estación Depuradora de Aguas Residuales |access-date=April 19, 2011 |publisher=Triple A |language=es |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824074339/http://perico.aaa.com.co/portal/page/portal/Triplea/Nuestros_Servicios/EDAR |archive-date=August 24, 2011 |df=mdy}}</ref>

;Noise

Among the most important monuments of the city are the Equestrian statue of Simón Bolívar (1919), in the square of the same name, the center of the city, the Carrara marble statue of Christopher Columbus the Discoverer on the Boulevard de la Carrera 50., which was a gift from the Italian colony in 1892 to mark the fourth centenary of the discovery of America, the Statue of Liberty at Independence Park, a gift from the [[Syria]]n colony in 1910 to mark the centenary of the Independence of Colombia, the statue of General Francisco de Paula Santander (1922) in the park of the same name and the Monumento a la Bandera (1932).

In 2007, three historic cannons that were used in the cause of independence were restored: the famous Cañón Verde, Boliche and Rebolo The first two were located in the corners of the south side of the Plaza de Bolívar and the last in the first floor of City Hall.

;Road Naming

Barranquilla has a complete road layout, where the roads are twisted in a perpendicular way forming blocks. Using an alphanumeric nomenclature replaced the vernacular names. Streets were named to those that progress from east to west and starting at the Maritime Terminal and those moving from south to north, from Avenue Circunvalar, in the field of the Metropolitan Stadium.

If the property is situated on a street, an address will begin by Calle (otherwise by Carrera), followed by the number of the street and then separated by the # symbol and then usually the name/number of the closest cross street. For example, Calle 47B # 21–10; Carrera 5 Sur # 50–04.

===Architecture===
Barranquilla's architecture was built almost entirely in the twentieth century. In the city there are buildings of the colonial period in the early decades of the independent nation, but the profusion of styles that flourished from the late nineteenth century give the city a cosmopolitan atmosphere. This architectural splendor is testament to the influence of the people arriving in the port for much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries from North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia, many of whom settled in Barranquilla and imported architectural styles.<ref name="umbral">{{cite book |last=Consuegra Bolívar |first=Ignacio |publisher=Grijalbo |title=Barranquilla: Umbral de la arquitectura en Colombia |year=2002 |isbn=958-639-181-7 |pages=309}}</ref>

Among the most important styles are neoclassical and art deco and interesting examples of neo-colonial architecture, modern, contemporary, eclectic, Mudejar, Spanish late Baroque, Mozarabic and [[Netherlands Antilles]] style Caribbean architecture. Some modern buildings are influenced by international architects such as [[Oscar Niemeyer]], [[Le Corbusier]] (who was in Barranquilla at the end of the 1940s), Leopoldo Rother, [[Mies van der Rohe]] and [[Richard Neutra]], among others that have contributed to an impressive architectural landscape.<ref name="umbral"/>

;Republican architecture
[[File:Bquilla-CasaRepublicana.jpg|thumb|Casona Republicana, an example of neo-classical architecture in the ''barrio'' of El Prado.]]

The so-called "Republican architecture" "style" refers to the architecture of the period in Colombia after independence in 1819, wand around 1930, which brings together different styles in the city, including the late baroque and neoclassical Spanish.

[[File:TorreIntercor.jpg|thumb|Executive Centre I in the north of Barranquilla.]]
This is a period in which the system ''Unidad de Poder Adquisitivo Constante'' (UPAC) resulted in the commercialization of architecture at the expense of spatial quality and aesthetics. The search for safer environments brought about the proliferation of housing complexes and shopping centres closed. The Postmodern Movement appears briefly trying to enhance the historical styles left behind by the modern movement. During this recovery period, buildings of important architectural heritage were recognized and protected such as the Centro Histórico. Among the most representative buildings of this period include the Executive Centre I, the Girasol building, the towers of the Banco Popular, Bogotá and Bancolombia, and the [[Rodrigo Lara Bonilla]] building.<ref name="umbral"/>
