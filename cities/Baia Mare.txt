Located south of the {{ill|Igniș Mountains|lt= Igniș|ro|Munții Igniș}} and [[Gutin Mountains|Gutâi]] mountains, Baia Mare had a population of 108,759 at the [[2021 Romanian census|2021 census]], and a [[Baia Mare metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] home to about 200,000 residents. The city administers four villages: Blidari (''Kőbánya''), Firiza (''Felsőfernezely''), Valea Borcutului (''Borpatak''), and Valea Neagră (''Feketepatak''). Baia Mare was named the Romanian Youth Capital from 2 May 2018 to 1 May 2019.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

=== Prehistory ===
{{Main|Prehistory of Transylvania}}

The city's development on the middle course of [[Săsar|Săsar River]], in the middle of a [[plateau]] with a warm Mediterranean-like climate, has facilitated living conditions since the [[Palaeolithic]].

=== Ancient times ===
{{See also|Bronze Age in Romania|Dacians|Dacia}}

During the [[Bronze Age]] the region was inhabited by [[Thracians|Thracian]] tribes. Later, it was included in the [[Dacia|Dacian Kingdom]] formed by the King [[Burebista]] when the mining exploration began, as the area is rich in [[gold]] and [[silver]].

=== Middle Ages ===
{{See also|Transylvania in the Middle Ages|Romania in the Middle Ages}}

Baia Mare is first mentioned in written documents released by [[Charles I of Hungary]] in 1328 under the name of ''Rivulus Dominarum'' ({{langx|en|Ladies' River}}). In 1347 the town was identified in documents by [[Louis I of Hungary]] as an important [[medieval]] town with a prosperous [[mining industry]]. Its rules of organisation were characteristic of the "free towns" of that time. In 1411 the town and its surrounding areas, including the mines, were transferred into the property of the [[Hunyadi family]] by [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], King of Hungary (later also Holy Roman Emperor), who recognised [[John Hunyadi|Janos Hunyadi]]'s contribution to stop the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] invasion of Europe.

The town went into a period of prosperity, during which the St. Stephen Cathedral was built. Today the cathedral tower is one of the best-known of the town's historic landmarks (see [[Stephen's Tower (Baia Mare)|Stephen's Tower]]). The first [[school]], named ''Schola Rivulina'', was opened in Baia Mare in 1547 by the [[Reformed Church]] following the [[Protestant Reformation]].

=== Modern period ===

In 1703 [[Pintea the Brave|Pintea Viteazul]] and his band managed to free the town for a short period of time from the [[Holy Roman Empire|German Imperial]] rule, under which it belonged the royal treasury. Since then Pintea is considered an important figure in the town's history, representing the idea of freedom. The Budești Church has Pintea's chain mail shirt and a helmet, reportedly worn by him in his battles. The Museum of Baia Mare displays his weapons and their harness.

In 1748 the city's [[mining industry]] made a leap forward when the [[Austria]]n authorities created the headquarters of "Superior Mining".

In the late nineteenth century, [[Simon Hollósy]], [[István Réti]], [[János Thorma]], [[Béla Iványi-Grünwald]], and [[Károly Ferenczy]] were among numerous young Hungarians who left the area to study the arts in [[Munich]], as Hungary lacked an academy of art in those times.<ref name="munich">[http://www.mng.hu/kiallitasok/idoszaki/munchen_english ''Munich in Hungarian, Hungarian Artists in Munich 1850-1914''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630224433/http://www.mng.hu/kiallitasok/idoszaki/munchen_english |date=30 June 2010 }}, 2 October 2009 - Jan 2010, Hungarian National Gallery</ref> Simon Hollósy, the young Hungarian painter, was teaching in his studio new western European techniques.

Some of those young painters decided to settle down together in Baia Mare, then called Nagybánya, to work on art. They persuaded Hollósy to join them and founded the [[Nagybánya artists' colony]], working on naturalism and ''[[plein air]]'' painting. The artists' colony became known later on for influencing the development of twentieth-century Hungarian and Romanian art.<ref name="munich"/> Works by each of these important painters is held by the [[Hungarian National Gallery]] in Budapest, which in 2009 opened the exhibit, [https://web.archive.org/web/20100630224433/http://www.mng.hu/kiallitasok/idoszaki/munchen_english ''Munich in Hungarian, Hungarian Artists in Munich 1850-1914''], 2 Oct 2009 - Jan 2010.

Following [[World War I]], the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was dissolved, and in 1920, Baia Mare officially became part of the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. It became part of Hungary again in 1940 by the [[Second Vienna Award]], until the end of [[World War II]]. Near the end of that period, the city hosted the [[Baia Mare ghetto]]. After the war, the city was returned to Romania. Shortly after World War II in postwar development, the town of Baia Mare started to grow both in population and inhabited area. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a new [[town centre]] was developed with [[modern architecture]] buildings and structures.

==Coat of arms==
[[File:BaiaMareFotoThalerTamas.jpg|thumb|Stephen's Tower in the town centre]]
The coat of arms of Baia Mare was granted to the city by the [[Government of Romania|Government]] in the late 1990s, early 2000s, some years after the communist symbols established in 1968 were de facto out of use starting [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989]].

The [[Heraldry#Shield and lozenge|shield]] is party per pale. In [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]], [[gules]] a miner in a [[Mining|mine]] [[argent]], in [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]], [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]] a church tower [[Or (heraldry)|or]]. The shield is topped by a [[mural crown]] with seven towers.

The miner refers to the main local economical activity. The church tower refers to the local cultural/ecclesiastical tradition. The crest shows the city's status as a [[Maramureș County|county]] seat.

==Geography==
The city is situated in the vicinity of the [[Gutin Mountains|Gutâi]] and {{ill|Igniș Mountains|lt= Igniș|ro|Munții Igniș}} mountains. Altitudes reach {{convert|1400|m|abbr=off}} in some peaks. The area is famous for its outstanding landscapes, and the mountains are easily accessible from the city, notable routes being: Igniș (1,307 m), Mogoșa (1,246 m), Gutâi (1,443 m), Creasta Cocoșului (1,450 m), Piatra Șoimului (839 m), Pleștioara (803 m), Dealul Bulat (683 m), Murgau (633 m), Dealul Crucii (500 m), etc.

The city is situated in the Baia Mare valley and is encircled on all sides by hills and mountains, which makes the climate in the city milder than the rest of the surrounding area. Proof of this is that the outskirts of Baia Mare are the only areas where you can find chestnut trees that usually need [[Mediterranean]] climate to grow. This is the northernmost reach of the [[chestnut tree]]. However, abrupt temperature changes take place and, during the winters, the temperatures may occasionally drop below -20 degrees Celsius.

The summers are mild, cooler than in the rest of the country. The precipitations in this area are quite high, due to the mountains in the north and east which do not allow the air masses to pass beyond the region's limits, the average rainfall being almost 1,000&nbsp;mm/year. The city of Baia Mare is the most populous of northern Romanian cities ([[Satu Mare]], [[Suceava]], and [[Botoșani]]), with a population of approximately 109,000. It also has a high level of culture and education, being home to theatres, schools, museums and art galleries.

Not far from the city there are a few very important natural reservations, among them Creasta Cocoșului, Cheile Tătărului, Lacul Albastru etc. Because of its privileged location in the [[Divisions of the Carpathians|Eastern Carpathian Mountains]] it is considered one of the most picturesque cities in [[Romania]].

Before the [[World War II|Second World War]], Baia Mare had a community of more than 1,000 [[Jews]]. In 1944, most of the Jews were deported by the Hungarian occupation authorities to Nazi concentration and extermination camps. Most of the few survivors emigrated from the area. {{As of|2011}}, 32 Jews lived in the city. Along with [[Rădăuți]], [[Gura Humorului]] and others, Baia Mare had a Jewish [[shtetl]], or settlement. The [[synagogue]] dates from 1885.
