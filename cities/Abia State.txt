'''Abia State''' ({{lang-ig|Ọha Abia}}) is a [[States of Nigeria|state]] in the [[South East (Nigeria)|South-East geopolitical zone]] of [[Nigeria]]. The state is bordered to the northwest by [[Anambra State|Anambra]] State and to the northeast by the states of [[Enugu]] and [[Ebonyi]], [[Imo State]] to the west, [[Cross River State]] to the east, [[Akwa Ibom State]] to the southeast, and [[Rivers State]] to the south. Abia is the only Southeastern state that has boundaries with the other four Southeastern states in Nigeria.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nigeria |first=Media |date=2023-12-02 |title=Which States Share Border With Abia State |url=https://www.medianigeria.com/which-states-share-border-with-abia-state/ |access-date=2024-01-30 |website=Media Nigeria |language=en-US}}</ref> It takes its name from the acronym for four of the state's most populated regions: Aba, Bende, Isuikwuato, and Afikpo (Afikpo was later joined with a part of Enugu state to create Ebonyi state in 1996).<ref>{{Cite web|title=History of Abia State Nigeria|url=https://allnigeriainfo.ng/history-of-abia-state/|access-date=2021-09-18|language=en-US}}</ref> The state capital is [[Umuahia]] while the largest city and commercial centre is [[Aba, Nigeria|Aba]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Aba {{!}} History & Facts {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Aba-Nigeria |access-date=2022-03-12 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last1=Esochaghi |first1=Gift |last2=Bukola |date=2023-05-14 |title=Aba: Once Abandoned Commercial City Undergoes Regeneration |url=https://newtelegraphng.com/aba-once-abandoned-commercial-city-undergoes-regeneration/ |access-date=2023-07-25 |website=New Telegraph |language=en-US}}</ref>

Abia is the [[List of Nigerian states by area|32nd largest state by area]] and [[List of Nigerian states by population|the 27th most populous]] with an estimated population of over 3,727,347 as of 2016.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Owoh |first=Uzondu Roy |date=2023-05-07 |title=Figure 1.

Other important geographical features are the [[Imo River|Imo]] and [[Aba River (Nigeria)|Aba Rivers]] which flow along the Abia's western and southern borders, respectively.

Modern-day Abia State has been inhabited for years by various ethnic groups, but it is predominantly inhabited by the [[Igbo people]]. In the pre-colonial period, what is now Abia State was a part of [[Arochukwu]]-based [[Aro Confederacy]] before the confederacy was defeated in the early 1900s by [[British troops]] in the [[Anglo-Aro War]]. After the war, the British incorporated the area into the [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate]] which later merged into [[British Nigeria]]; after the merger, Abia became a centre of anti-colonial resistance with the [[Women's War]] that started in [[Oloko]].

After independence in 1960, Abia was part of the post-independence [[Eastern Region, Nigeria|Eastern Region]] until 1967 before the region was split and it became part of the [[East Central State]]. Less than two months afterwards, the former Eastern Region attempted to secede in the three-year long [[Nigerian Civil War]] with Abia as a part of the secessionist state of [[Biafra]]. At the war's end and for the reunification of Nigeria, the East Central State was merged as one until 1976 when Imo State (including now-Abia) was formed by the [[Murtala Muhammed]] regime. Fifteen years afterwards, Imo State was divided with eastern Imo being broken off to form the old Abia State; but in 1996, part of Abia's northeast was removed to form a part of the new [[Ebonyi State]].<ref>{{cite web |title=This is how the 36 states were created |url=https://www.pulse.ng/news/local/nigerian-states-this-is-how-the-36-states-were-created/mdtnq3e |website=Pulse.ng |access-date=15 December 2021}}</ref>

Economically, Abia State is based around the production of [[crude oil]] and [[natural gas]] along with agriculture, mainly cultivation of [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[maize]], [[taro]], [[oil palm]], and [[cassava]]. It has a high concentration of medium-scale manufacturing clusters in the city of [[Aba, Nigeria|Aba]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Abia|title=Abia|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|access-date=14 December 2021}}</ref> With its fast growing population and industrialization, Abia has the [[List of Nigerian states by Human Development Index#2019|joint-eighth highest]] [[Human Development Index]] in Nigeria.<ref>{{cite web |title=Human Development Indices |url=https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/shdi/ |website=Global Data Lab |access-date=15 December 2021}}</ref>

=== Environmental Issues ===

==== Solid waste ====
Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) deals with the collection, storing, treatment and disposal of [[solid waste]], to ensure that it does not affect humans, living things and the environment at large. There are factors that influences the [[Municipal solid waste]] generation such as income level, local climatic condition, [[urbanization]] and economic development.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last1=Ezechi |first1=Ezerie Henry |last2=Nwabuko |first2=Chima George |last3=Enyinnaya |first3=Ogbonna Chidi |last4=Babington |first4=Chibunna John |date=September 2017 |title=Municipal solid waste management in Aba, Nigeria: Challenges and prospects |url=http://www.eeer.org/journal/view.php?number=874 |journal=Environmental Engineering Research |language=English |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=231–236 |doi=10.4491/eer.2017.100 |issn=1226-1025|doi-access=free }}</ref> MSW in Aba, Abia State is classified into;

# Domestic waste (waste from households, food centers, markets, and commercial premises)
# Industrial waste (excluding toxic waste that requires special handling)
# Institutional waste (waste from government establishments, schools, hospitals and recreational facilities
In recent times, it was reported that aba and Umuahia generates up to two hundred and seventy truckloads of domestic and commercial waste daily. This information was made known to the public by Governor Alex Otti during his inauguration speech after taking the baton of government from the former governor, [[Okezie Ikpeazu]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Report |first=Agency |date=2023-07-01 |title=Umuahia, Aba generate 270 truckloads of refuse daily – Task Force |url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/ssouth-east/607501-umuahia-aba-generate-270-truckloads-of-refuse-daily-task-force.html |access-date=2023-07-25 |website=Premium Times Nigeria |language=en-GB}}</ref>

== History and population ==
Abia State is one of the thirty-six States in Nigeria, and has about seventeen [[Local government area|Local Government Areas]], out of the 774 Local Government Areas that make up the [[Federal Republic of Nigeria]]. Abia State was created on the 27th of August 1991, during the government of General [[Ibrahim Babangida]]. The State is located in the south-eastern part of Nigeria. Abia state was created out of Imo State, and the two sister states share boundaries. Abia State is known as one of the constituent states of the Niger Delta region. The state has its capital at [[Umuahia]] while the commercial city of the state is Aba. Abia State is also referred to as ''God's own state''. The name "Abia" is an abbreviation of four of Abia state's densely populated regions [[Aba, Abia|Aba]], [[Bende, Nigeria|Bende]], [[Isuikwuato]], and [[Afikpo]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=History of Abia State Nigeria {{!}} AllNigeriaInfo|url=https://allnigeriainfo.ng/history-of-abia-state/|access-date=2021-09-18|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abia-union.org/abia_state_history |title=Abia State history |publisher=Abia-union.org |access-date=28 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903034433/http://www.abia-union.org/abia_state_history |archive-date=3 September 2011 }}</ref>

The [[Igbo people]], who are one of the indigenous peoples of the South-eastern part of Nigeria, make up 95% of the population.  Their traditional language, [[Igbo language|Igbo]], is in widespread use. [[Ibibio language|Ibibio]] is spoken as a minority language, especially in [[Arochukwu]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.igbofocus.co.uk/html/enugu_state.html |title=Enugu State |publisher=Igbofocus.co.uk |date=17 January 2012 |access-date=28 October 2012 |archive-date=13 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113050723/http://www.igbofocus.co.uk/html/enugu_state.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> English is also widely spoken and serves as the official language in governance and business.

== Infrastructure and economy ==
[[Petroleum|Crude oil]] and [[Natural gas|gas]] production is a prominent activity, as it contributes over 39%  of the State's [[GDP]].<ref name="ReferenceA">Nigeria's 36 States and the FCT, Economic, societal and political profiles, World Bank Report</ref> However, the indigenous oil companies – through the Marginal Fields Programme (MFP) – have not found it easy to attract the requisite funding and infrastructural capacity, to explore some of the marginal oil fields which are about 50 in the State.<ref name="www.channelstv.com" />

The manufacturing sector only accounts for 2% of the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]].<ref name="ReferenceA" /> The industrial centre of the state is in [[Aba, Abia|Aba]], with [[textile]] manufacturing, [[pharmaceutical]]s, [[soap]], [[plastic]]s, [[cement]], [[footwear]], and [[cosmetics]].<ref name=EB /> In addition to the above, Abia State Government has just built a 9,000 capacity multipurpose International Conference Centre in Umuahia. This edifice of international standard was built by Governor [[Theodore Orji|T.A Orji]], to enhance tourism as well as boost the state economy, through hosting of major International and Local events.

Representing 27% of the GDP,<ref name="ReferenceA" /> agriculture – which employs 70%<ref name="ReferenceA" /> of the state workforce – is the second economic sector of Abia. With its adequate seasonal rainfall, Abia has much [[arable land]] that produces [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[maize]], [[potato]]es, [[rice]], [[cashew]]s, [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], [[taro]], and [[cassava]].<ref name=EB /> [[Oil palm]] is the most important [[cash crop]].<ref name=EB />

=== Oil and gas exploration ===
There are over 100 [[oil well]]s and 3 installed flow stations in Abia State.<ref name="www.channelstv.com" /><ref name="www.vanguardngr.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/08/our-problem-is-poor-funding-asopadec-chairman/|title=Our problem is poor funding – ASOPADEC Chairman|access-date=30 November 2015|date=7 August 2012|work=vanguardngr.com|author=Vanguard, Nigeria }}</ref> There is also an associated gas plant, Abia/NNPC gas plant.<ref name="www.vanguardngr.com" /> As of 2012, boundary Commission said it returned 42 oil wells from neighbouring [[Rivers State]] to Abia.<ref name="www.vanguardngr.com" /> This would have meant Abia was r fourth largest oil-producing state in the country.<ref name="www.vanguardngr.com" /> Oil giant, [[Shell Nigeria|Shell]], holds most of the licenses for the wells in the State, and has concentrated on the estimated 50 wells that are considered high-yield.<ref name="www.channelstv.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.channelstv.com/2013/04/14/harnessing-abias-oil-and-gas-potentials/|title=Harnessing Abia's oil and gas potentials|access-date=30 November 2015|date=14 April 2013|work=channelstv.com|author=Channelstv, Nigeria }}</ref>

The state produced 36,000 barrels of crude oil per day; "Imoturu produces 23,000 barrels per day and Isimili flow station produces over 8,000 barrels of crude oil per day.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Top Locations of Crude Oil in Nigeria|url=https://nigerianfinder.com/locations-of-crude-oil-in-nigeria/|access-date=2022-02-13|website=nigerianfinder.com}}</ref> Then four oil wells in Izaku go to Obigo flow station. About 30 oil wells from my village go to Umuri, and about eight oil wells from Umurie go to Afam", said Samuel Okezie Nwogu, Chairman of Abia State Oil Producing Development Area Commission (ASOPADEC). However, the State has complained of poor funding from its oil revenue federal allocation.<ref name="www.vanguardngr.com" />

[[File:Renovated Abia State House of Assembly.jpg|300px|thumb|Abia State House of Assembly, Nigeria]]

At statehood in 1991, Abia was ruled by [[Ibrahim Babangida]]-appointed Military Administrator [[Frank Ajobena]] before [[Ogbonnaya Onu]] was [[1991 Abia State gubernatorial election|elected]] governor later that year under the [[Third Nigerian Republic]]. Onu governed for nearly two years before [[Sani Abacha]] ended the Third Republic and reinstated full military rule. Under the Abacha regime, three more Military Administrators ([[Chinyere Ike Nwosu]], [[Temi Ejoor]], and [[Moses Fasanya]]) were appointed before Abacha's death and the accession of [[Abdulsalami Abubakar]]. Abubakar appointed one more Military Administrator, [[Anthony Obi]], before starting the transition to democracy in 1998.

In 1999, Nigeria returned to democracy, and [[Orji Uzor Kalu]] was [[1999 Abia State gubernatorial election|elected]] governor on the platform of the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party]]. Consequently, he was sworn in on 29 May 1999. In 2003, when it was time for fresh elections, Kalu re-contested on the platform of the PDP and [[2003 Abia State gubernatorial election|got a second mandate]] to govern (the [[Constitution of Nigeria]] limits Governors to two terms in office). At the end of Kalu's term in 2007, [[Theodore Orji]] ([[Progressive Peoples Alliance|PPA]]) defeated [[Onyema Ugochukwu]] (PDP) in the [[2007 Abia State gubernatorial election|2007 gubernatorial election]], to become Abia's next Governor. In 2011, Theodore Orji defected from the PPA to the PDP before being [[2011 Abia State gubernatorial election|re-elected]] for another four-year term later that year.

In 2015, [[Okezie Ikpeazu]] (PDP) was [[2015 Abia State gubernatorial election|voted in]] as the ninth Governor of Abia State.<ref>[http://www.channelstv.com/2015/04/26/inec-declares-ikpeazu-winner-of-abia-governorship-election/ INEC Declares Ikpeazu Winner Of Abia Governorship Election]</ref> Four years later, he won [[2019 Abia State gubernatorial election|re-election]], defeating [[Uchechukwu Sampson Ogah|Uche Ogah]] of the [[All Progressives Congress]] and [[Alex Otti]] of [[All Progressives Grand Alliance|APGA]] to be sworn in as Governor for a second term on 29 May 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Emeruwa |first=Chijindu |date=2019-05-29 |title=Gov.

In 2023, Alex Otti of the [[Labour Party (Nigeria)|Labour Party Nigeria]] (LP) emerged as the eleventh governor of the state having defeated the candidate of the PDP in a fiercely contested race.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nwakanma |first=Sunday |date=2023-05-29 |title=Otti sworn in as Abia governor |url=https://punchng.com/otti-sworn-in-as-abia-governor/ |access-date=2023-07-25 |website=Punch Newspapers |language=en-US}}</ref>

== Electoral system ==
The electoral system of each state is selected using a modified two-round system. To be elected in the first round, a candidate must receive the plurality of the vote and over 25% of the vote in at least two -third of the State local government Areas. If no candidate passes threshold, a second round will be held between the top candidate and the next candidate to have received a plurality of votes in the highest number of local government Areas.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Oguntola |first=Tunde |date=2022-09-27 |title=2023: Next President, Govs Must Get Two-thirds Spread, Says INEC |url=https://leadership.ng/2023-next-president-govs-must-get-two-thirds-spread-says-inec/ |access-date=2023-02-23 |language=en-US}}</ref>
