==Etymology==
The origin of the name is unknown. There are various theories regarding the origin of the toponym "Madrid" (all of them with problems when it comes to fully explaining the phonetic evolution of the toponym), namely:<ref name= Orozco>{{Cite journal |last=Pérez Orozco |title=El origen del topónimo Madrid |first=Santiago |journal=Anales del Instituto de Estudios Madrileños |publisher=[[Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas]] |location=Madrid |volume=XLVII |year=2007 |pages=701–703 |issn=0584-6374 |url=https://xn--institutoestudiosmadrileos-4rc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Tomo_XLVII_2007.pdf |access-date=17 September 2021 |archive-date=17 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210917163136/https://xn--institutoestudiosmadrileos-4rc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Tomo_XLVII_2007.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref>

<!--
{{script|Arab|مجريط}} ''Majrīṭ'' (AFI {{IPA|[madʒriːtˤ]}}) is the first documented reference to the city. It is recorded in [[Andalusi Arabic]] during the [[al-Andalus]] period. The name ''Magerit'' ({{IPA|[madʒeˈɾit]}}) was retained in [[Old Spanish language|Medieval Spanish]]. The most ancient recorded name of the city "Magerit" (for ''*Materit'' or ''*Mageterit''?) comes from the name of a fortress built on the Manzanares River in the 9th century [[Anno Domini|AD]], and means "Place of abundant water" in Arabic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indigoguide.com/spain/madrid-history.htm |title=Madrid History&nbsp;– Museums&nbsp;– Suggested Itineraries Madrid |publisher=Indigoguide.com |access-date=3 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101205922/http://www.indigoguide.com/spain/madrid-history.htm |archive-date=1 January 2011}}</ref> A wider number of theories have been formulated on possible earlier origins.

According to legend, Madrid was founded by Ocno Bianor (son of King Tyrrhenius of Tuscany and [[Mantua]]) and was named "Metragirta" or "Mantua Carpetana". Others contend that the original name of the city was "Ursaria" ("land of [[bear]]s" in [[Latin]]), because of the many bears that were to be found in the nearby forests, which, together with the [[Arbutus unedo|strawberry tree]] (Spanish ''madroño''), have been the emblem of the city since the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=autogenerated>{{cite web |url=http://elmadridmedieval.jmcastellanos.com/ |title=El Madrid Medieval (Medieval Madrid). Includes Pre-historic, Roman and medieval up to the Catholic Monarchs |work=History of Madrid. |publisher=José Manuel Castellanos |access-date=28 October 2007 |language=es}}</ref>

Nevertheless, it is also speculated that the origin of the name of the city comes from the 2nd century BC. The [[Roman Empire]] established a settlement on the banks of the [[Manzanares (river)|Manzanares]] river. The name of this first village was "Matrice" (a reference to the river that crossed the settlement). Following the invasions carried out by the Germanic [[Suebi|Sueves]] and [[Vandals]], as well as the Sarmatic [[Alans]] during the 5th century AD, the Roman Empire no longer had the military presence required to defend its territories on the Iberian Peninsula, and as a consequence, these territories were soon occupied by the [[Vandals]], who were in turn dispelled by the [[Visigoths]], who then ruled [[Hispania]] in the name of the Roman emperor, also taking control of "Matrice". In the 8th century, the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula]] saw the name changed to "Mayrit", from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term {{lang|ar|ميرا}} ''Mayra''{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} (referencing water as a 'tree' or 'giver of life') and the Ibero-Roman suffix ''it'' that means 'place'. The modern "Madrid" evolved from the [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]] "Matrit", which is still in the Madrilenian [[Demonym|gentilic]].<ref name="El origen del nombre">{{cite news |url=http://www.nova.es/~jlb/mad_es05.htm |publisher=JLL & JRP |date=16 August 2006 |title=El origen del nombre.}}</ref>

===Middle Ages===
The first historical document about the existence of an established settlement in Madrid dates from the [[Muslim]] age. In the second half of the 9th century,<ref>{{cite web |title=Madrid Islámico |url=http://www.nova.es/~jlb/mad_es08.htm |publisher=Nova.es |access-date=7 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991002215943/http://www.nova.es/~jlb/mad_es08.htm |archive-date=2 October 1999 |url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Emirate of Córdoba|Umayyad]] Emir [[Muhammad I of Córdoba|Muhammad I]] built a fortress on a headland near the river [[Manzanares (river)|Manzanares]]<ref>It was recorded in the 15th century by the Arab geographer al-Himyari, who wrote in his "The Book of the Fragrant Garden" (Kitab al-Rawd al-Mitar) about the history of the city. He describes: "Madrid, remarkable city of Al-Andalus, which was built by Amir Muhammad ibn Abd ar-Rahman..."</ref> as one of the many fortresses he ordered to be built on the border between [[Al-Andalus]] and the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of León|León]] and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], with the objective of protecting [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] from the Christian reconquests and also as a starting point for Muslim offensives. After the disintegration of the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]] in the early 11th century, Madrid was integrated in the [[Taifa of Toledo]].

In the context of the wider campaign for the conquest of the taifa of Toledo initiated in 1079, Madrid was seized in 1083 by [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile]], who sought to use the town as an offensive outpost against the city of Toledo,{{Sfn|Bahamonde Magro|Otero Carvajal|1989|p=9}} in turn conquered in 1085. Following the conquest, Christians occupied the center of the city, while Muslims and Jews were displaced to the suburbs. Madrid, located near [[Alcalá de Henares|Alcalá]] (under Muslim control until 1118), remained a borderland for a while, suffering a number of ''[[Razzia (military)|razzias]]'' during the [[Almoravid]] period, and its walls were destroyed in 1110.{{Sfn|Bahamonde Magro|Otero Carvajal|1989|p=9}} The city was confirmed as ''villa de {{ill|realengo (legal status)|es|realengo|lt=realengo}}'' (linked to the Crown) in 1123, during the reign of [[Alfonso VII of León and Castile|Alfonso VII]].{{Sfn|Cestero Mancera|Molina Martos|Paredes García|2015|p=18}} The 1123 Charter of Otorgamiento established the first explicit limits between Madrid and Segovia, namely the Puerto de El Berrueco and the Puerto de Lozoya.{{Sfn|Cerrillo Torquemada|2009|p=245}} Beginning in 1188, Madrid had the right to be a city with representation in the courts of Castile.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} In 1202, [[Alfonso VIII of Castile|Alfonso VIII]] gave Madrid its first charter to regulate the municipal council,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.madrid.es/portales/munimadrid/es/Inicio/Ayuntamiento/Un-paseo-por-su-historia/Madrid-antiguo-y-medieval/El-Siglo-XIII?vgnextfmt=default&vgnextoid=51ac315b048b9010VgnVCM100000d90ca8c0RCRD&vgnextchannel=56602c91497b9010VgnVCM100000d90ca8c0RCRD |title=Ayuntamiento de Madrid – El Siglo XIII |language=es |publisher=Madrid.es |access-date=7 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023002100/http://www.madrid.es/portales/munimadrid/es/Inicio/Ayuntamiento/Un-paseo-por-su-historia/Madrid-antiguo-y-medieval/El-Siglo-XIII?vgnextfmt=default&vgnextoid=51ac315b048b9010VgnVCM100000d90ca8c0RCRD&vgnextchannel=56602c91497b9010VgnVCM100000d90ca8c0RCRD |archive-date=23 October 2012}}</ref> which was expanded in 1222 by [[Ferdinand III of Castile|Ferdinand III]].

Starting in the mid-13th century and up to the late 14th century, the ''concejo'' of Madrid vied for the control of the Real de Manzanares territory against the ''concejo'' of [[Segovia]], a powerful town north of the [[Sierra de Guadarrama]] mountain range, characterised by its repopulating prowess and its husbandry-based economy, contrasted with the agricultural and less repopulated town of Madrid.{{Sfn|Bahamonde Magro|Otero Carvajal|1989|pp=11–12}} After the decline of [[Sepúlveda, Segovia|Sepúlveda]], another ''concejo'' north of the mountain range, Segovia had become a major actor south of the Guadarrama mountains, expanding across the [[Lozoya (river)|Lozoya]] and [[Manzanares River|Manzanares]] rivers to the north of Madrid and along the [[Guadarrama (river)|Guadarrama river]] course to its west.{{Sfn|Bahamonde Magro|Otero Carvajal|1989|pp=11–12}}

In 1309, the Courts of Castile convened at Madrid for the first time under [[Ferdinand IV of Castile|Ferdinand IV]], and later in 1329, 1339, 1391, 1393, 1419 and twice in 1435.

===Modern Age===
During the [[revolt of the Comuneros]], led by [[Juan Lopez de Padilla]], Madrid joined the revolt against [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles, Holy Roman Emperor]], but after defeat at the [[Battle of Villalar]], Madrid was besieged and occupied by the imperial troops. The city was however granted the titles of ''Coronada'' (Crowned) and ''Imperial''.

The number of urban inhabitants grew from 4,060 in the year 1530 to 37,500 in the year 1594. The poor population of the court was composed of ex-soldiers, foreigners, rogues and Ruanes, dissatisfied with the lack of food and high prices. In June 1561 [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip II]] set his court in Madrid, installing it in the old [[Royal Alcazar of Madrid|''alcázar'']].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.madrid.es/portales/munimadrid/es/Inicio/Ayuntamiento/Un-paseo-por-su-historia/La-ciudad-desde-la-llegada-de-la-Corte/Madrid-capital?vgnextfmt=default&vgnextoid=fbf2378305898110VgnVCM2000000c205a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=94321cf0ceca8110VgnVCM1000000b205a0aRCRD |title=Ayuntamiento de Madrid – Madrid capital |language=es |publisher=Madrid.es |access-date=7 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723101302/http://www.madrid.es/portales/munimadrid/es/Inicio/Ayuntamiento/Un-paseo-por-su-historia/La-ciudad-desde-la-llegada-de-la-Corte/Madrid-capital?vgnextfmt=default&vgnextoid=fbf2378305898110VgnVCM2000000c205a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=94321cf0ceca8110VgnVCM1000000b205a0aRCRD |archive-date=23 July 2013}}</ref> Thanks to this, the city of Madrid became the political centre of the monarchy, being the capital of Spain except for a short period between 1601 and 1606, in which the Court was relocated to [[Valladolid]] (and the Madrid population temporarily plummeted accordingly). Being the capital was decisive for the evolution of the city and influenced its fate and during the rest of the reign of Philip II, the population boomed, going up from about 18,000 in 1561 to 80,000 in 1598.{{Sfn|Parsons|2003|p=13}}

During the early 17th century, although Madrid recovered from the loss of the capital status, with the return of diplomats, lords and affluent people, as well as an entourage of noted writers and artists together with them, extreme poverty was however rampant.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=El reverso de la medalla.

{{Main|Dos de Mayo Uprising}}
In the context of the [[Peninsular War]], the situation in French-occupied Madrid after March 1808 was becoming more and more tense. On 2 May, a crowd began to gather near the [[Royal Palace of Madrid|Royal Palace]] protesting against the French attempt to evict the remaining members of the Bourbon royal family to [[Bayonne]], prompting up an uprising against the French Imperial troops that lasted hours and spread throughout the city, including a famous last stand at the Monteleón barracks. Subsequent repression was brutal, with many insurgent Spaniards being [[Summary execution|summarily executed]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.madrid.es/portales/munimadrid/es/Inicio/Ayuntamiento/Un-paseo-por-su-historia/La-ciudad-desde-la-llegada-de-la-Corte/Madrid-y-la-Guerra-de-la-Independencia?vgnextfmt=default&vgnextoid=76e2b798e1e98110VgnVCM1000000b205a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=94321cf0ceca8110VgnVCM1000000b205a0aRCRD |title=Ayuntamiento de Madrid – Madrid y la Guerra de la Independencia |language=es |publisher=Madrid.es |access-date=7 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723103126/http://www.madrid.es/portales/munimadrid/es/Inicio/Ayuntamiento/Un-paseo-por-su-historia/La-ciudad-desde-la-llegada-de-la-Corte/Madrid-y-la-Guerra-de-la-Independencia?vgnextfmt=default&vgnextoid=76e2b798e1e98110VgnVCM1000000b205a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=94321cf0ceca8110VgnVCM1000000b205a0aRCRD |archive-date=23 July 2013}}</ref> The uprising led to a declaration of war calling all the Spaniards to fight against the French invaders.

===Capital of the Liberal State===
[[File:Plano del Ensanche de Madrid-1861.jpg|thumb|right|1861 map of the ''Ensanche de Madrid'']]
The city was invaded on 24 May 1823 by a French army—the so-called [[Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis]]—called to intervene to restore the [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] of Ferdinand that the latter had been deprived from during the [[Trienio liberal|1820–1823 ''trienio liberal'']].<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://journals.openedition.org/argonauta/4257 |title=Afrancesados, moderados, exaltados, masones y comuneros: periódicos y periodistas ante el conflicto político en la prensa de Madrid durante el Trienio Liberal (1820–1823) |first=Víctor |last=Sánchez Martín |doi=10.4000/argonauta.4257 |year=2020 |journal=El Argonauta Español |volume=17 |issue=17 |issn=1765-2901 |doi-access=free |access-date=2 September 2020 |archive-date=16 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200816052009/https://journals.openedition.org/argonauta/4257 |url-status=live}}</ref> Unlike other European capitals, during the first half of the 19th century the only noticeable bourgeois elements in Madrid (that experienced a delay in its industrial development up to that point) were merchants.{{Sfn|García Ruiz|2011|p=192}} The University of Alcalá de Henares was relocated to Madrid in 1836, becoming the [[Complutense University of Madrid|Central University]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.madridiario.es/461562/efemeride-universida-complutense-alcala-madrid |title=Cuando la 'Complu' se mudó al centro |date=29 October 2018 |website=Madridiario |access-date=3 September 2020 |archive-date=1 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201201125429/https://www.madridiario.es/461562/efemeride-universida-complutense-alcala-madrid |url-status=live}}</ref>

The economy of the city further modernized during the second half of the 19th century, consolidating its status as a service and financial centre. New industries were mostly focused in book publishing, construction and low-tech sectors.{{Sfn|García Ruiz|2011|p=193}} The introduction of [[railway transport]] greatly helped Madrid's economic prowess, and led to changes in consumption patterns (such as the substitution of salted fish for fresh fish from the Spanish coasts) as well as further strengthening the city's role as a [[Logistics|logistics node]] in the country's distribution network.{{Sfn|García Ruiz|2011|p=194}} Electric lighting in the streets was introduced in the 1890s.{{Sfn|García Ruiz|2011|p=194}}

During the first third of the 20th century the population nearly doubled, reaching more than 850,000 inhabitants.

===Second Republic and Civil War===
[[File:Children during the Madrid bombing.jpg|thumb|upright|Children taking refuge during the Francoist bombings (1936–1937) over Madrid during the [[Spanish Civil War]]]]
The [[Spanish Constitution of 1931]] was the first to legislate the location of the country's capital, setting it explicitly in Madrid. During the 1930s, Madrid enjoyed "great vitality"; it was demographically young, becoming urbanized and the centre of new political movements.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Montero |first1=Julio |last2=Cervera Gil |first2=Javier |date=2009 |title=Madrid en los años treinta: ambiente social, político, cultural y religioso |url=https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/2954677.pdf |journal=Studia et Documenta: Rivista dell'Istituto Storico San Josemaría Escrivá |issue=3 |page=15 |issn=1970-4879 |access-date=3 February 2020 |archive-date=7 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190607234843/https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/2954677.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref> During this time, major construction projects were undertaken, including the northern extension of the [[Paseo de la Castellana]], one of Madrid's major thoroughfares.{{Sfn|Montero|Cervera Gil|2009|p=16}} The tertiary sector, including banking, insurance and telephone services, grew greatly.{{Sfn|Montero|Cervera Gil|2009|p=20}} Illiteracy rates were down to below 20%, and the city's cultural life grew notably during the so-called ''Silver Age'' of Spanish Culture; the sales of newspapers also increased.{{Sfn|Montero|Cervera Gil|2009|p=21}} Conversely, the proclamation of the Republic created a severe housing shortage. Slums and squalor grew due to high population growth and the influx of the poor to the city.

Madrid was one of the most heavily affected cities in the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939).

[[File:Madrid, Tetuán 1978 01.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|The [[calle de Bravo Murillo]] in 1978]]
A staple of post-war Madrid (''Madrid de la posguerra'') was the widespread use of [[Rationing|ration coupons]].{{Sfn|García Ballesteros|Revilla González|2006|p=16}} Meat and fish consumption was scarce, resulting in high mortality due to malnutrition.{{Sfn|García Ballesteros|Revilla González|2006|pp=17–18}} Due to Madrid's history as a left-wing stronghold, the right-wing victors considered moving the capital elsewhere (most notably to [[Seville]]), but such plans were never implemented. The [[Franco regime]] instead emphasized the city's history as the capital of formerly imperial Spain.{{Sfn|Faraldo|Rodríguez-López|2019|pp=107–124}}

The intense demographic growth experienced by the city via mass immigration from the rural areas of the country led to the construction of abundant housing in the peripheral areas of the city to absorb the new population (reinforcing the processes of social polarization of the city),{{Sfn|López Simón|2018|p=175}} initially comprising substandard housing (with as many as 50,000 [[shack]]s scattered around the city by 1956).{{Sfn|López Simón|2018|p=175; 178}} A transitional planning intended to temporarily replace the shanty towns were the ''poblados de absorción'', introduced since the mid-1950s in locations such as [[Canillas (Madrid)|Canillas]], [[San Fermín (Madrid)|San Fermín]], Caño Roto, [[Villaverde (Madrid)|Villaverde]], {{ill|Pan Bendito|es}}, [[El Zofío|Zofío]] and [[Fuencarral]], aiming to work as a sort of "high-end" shacks (with the destinataries participating in the construction of their own housing) but under the aegis of a wider coordinated urban planning.{{Sfn|López Simón|2018|pp=179–180}}

Madrid grew through the annexation of neighboring municipalities, achieving the present extent of {{cvt|607|km2|2}}. The south of Madrid became heavily industrialized, and there was significant [[Human migration|immigration]] from rural areas of Spain. Madrid's newly built north-western districts became the home of a newly enriched middle class that appeared as result of the [[Spanish miracle|1960s Spanish economic boom]], while the south-eastern periphery became a large working-class area, which formed the base for active cultural and political movements.<ref name="History of Madrid 2"/>

===Recent history===
After the fall of the Francoist regime, the new [[Constitution of Spain|1978 constitution]] confirmed Madrid as the capital of Spain. The [[1979 Madrid City Council election|1979 municipal election]] brought Madrid's first democratically elected mayor since the Second Republic to power.

Madrid was the scene of some of the most important events of the time, such as the mass demonstrations of support for democracy after the failed coup, [[23-F]], on 23 February 1981. The first democratic mayors belonged to the centre-left [[PSOE]] ([[Enrique Tierno Galván]], [[Juan Barranco Gallardo]]). Since the late 1970s and through the 1980s Madrid became the center of the cultural movement known as ''[[Movida madrileña|la Movida]]''. Conversely, just like in the rest of the country, a [[Opioid epidemic|heroin crisis]] took a toll in the poor neighborhoods of Madrid in the 1980s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.jotdown.es/2018/10/quinquis-un-vistazo-rapido-a-las-barriadas-espanolas-de-los-ochenta/ |title=Quinquis: un vistazo rápido a las barriadas españolas de los 80 |first=Nacho |last=Carretero |date=October 2018 |website=Jot Down |access-date=6 February 2020 |archive-date=23 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200523201018/https://www.jotdown.es/2018/10/quinquis-un-vistazo-rapido-a-las-barriadas-espanolas-de-los-ochenta/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

Madrid has the second highest number of aligned trees in the world, with 248,000 units, only exceeded by Tokyo. Madrid's citizens have access to a green area within a 15-minute walk. Since 1997, green areas have increased by 16%. At present, 8.2% of Madrid's grounds are green areas, meaning that there are {{cvt|16|m2|0}} of green area per inhabitant, far exceeding the {{cvt|10|m2|0}} per inhabitant recommended by the World Health Organization.

A great bulk of the most important parks in Madrid are related to areas originally belonging to the royal assets (including El Pardo, Soto de Viñuelas, Casa de Campo, El Buen Retiro, la Florida and the [[Príncipe Pío (hill)|Príncipe Pío hill]], and the Queen's Casino).{{Sfn|Galiana Martín|1994|pp=46; 50}} The other main source for the "green" areas are the ''{{ill|bienes de propios|es}}'' owned by the municipality (including the Dehesa de la Villa, the Dehesa de Arganzuela or Viveros).{{Sfn|Galiana Martín|1994|p=50}}

[[File:Templo de Debod in Madrid.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Temple of Debod]], an ancient Egyptian temple dismantled and rebuilt in the [[Parque del Oeste]].]]

[[Buen Retiro Park]] (''Parque del Buen Retiro'', or simply ''Parque del Retiro''), formerly the grounds of the palace built for [[Philip IV of Spain]], is the largest park in central Madrid. Its area is more than {{cvt|1.4|km²|1}} (350 acres) and it is located very close to the [[Puerta de Alcalá]] and not far from the [[Prado Museum]]. The park is entirely surrounded by the present-day city. Its lake in the middle once staged mini naval sham battles to amuse royalty; these days the more tranquil pastime of pleasure boating is popular. Inspired by London's Crystal Palace, the [[Palacio de Cristal del Retiro|Palacio de Cristal]] can be found at the south-eastern end of the park.

In the Buen Retiro Park is also the [[Forest of the Departed]] (''Bosque de los Ausentes''), a memorial monument to commemorate the 191 victims of the [[2004 Madrid train bombings|11 March 2004 Madrid attacks]].

[[Madrid Atocha railway station|Atocha Railway Station]] (''Estación de Atocha'') is the city's first and most [[central station]], and is also home to a {{cvt|4,000|m2|0|abbr=off|adj=mid}} indoor garden, with more than 500 species of plant life and ponds with turtles and goldfish in.

[[File:Casa de Campo Lago y vista.jpg|thumb|[[Casa de Campo]] park]]
[[Casa de Campo]] is an enormous urban parkland to the west of the city, the largest in [[Spain]] and Madrid's main green lung. Its area is more than 1,700 hectares (6.6 sq mi). It is home to a fairground, the [[Zoo Aquarium de Madrid|Madrid Zoo]], an amusement park, the [[Parque de Atracciones de Madrid]], and an outdoor municipal pool, to enjoy a bird's eye view of the park and city take a cable car trip above the tree tops. Casa de Campo's vegetation is one of its most important features. There are, in fact, three different ecosystems: oak, pine and river groves. The oak is the dominant tree species in the area and, although many of them are over 100 years old and reach a great height, they are also present in the form of chaparral and bushes. The pine-forest ecosystem boasts many trees that have adapted perfectly to the light, dry conditions in the park. In addition, mushrooms often emerge after the first rains of autumn. Finally, the river groves, or riparian forests, are made up of various, mainly deciduous, species that grow in wetter areas. Examples include poplars, willows and alder trees. As regards fauna, this green space is home to approximately 133 vertebrate species.

The [[Real Jardín Botánico de Madrid|Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid]] (''Real Jardín Botánico de Madrid'') is an 8-hectare [[botanical garden]] located in the Plaza de Murillo, next to the [[Prado Museum]]. It was an 18th-century creation by [[Charles III of Spain|Carlos III]] and it was used as a base for the plant species being collected across the globe. There is an important research facility that started life as a base to develop [[herbalism|herbal remedies]] and to house the species collected from the new-world trips, today it is dedicated to maintaining Europe's ecosystem.

[[File:Campo del Moro (Madrid) 04.jpg|thumb|left|The Campo del Moro gardens near the Royal Palace]]
The [[Royal Palace of Madrid|Royal Palace]] (''Palacio Real'') is surrounded by three green areas. In front of the palace, are the gardens of the Plaza de Oriente; to the north, the gardens of Sabatini and to the west up to the Manzanares River, the famous Campo del Moro. [[Royal Palace of Madrid#Campo del Moro Gardens|Campo del Moro gardens]] has a surface area of 20 hectares and is a scenic garden with an unusual layout filled with foliage and an air of English romanticism. The [[Sabatini Gardens]] have a formal Neoclassic style, consisting of well-trimmed hedges, in symmetric geometrical patterns, adorned with a pool, statues and fountains, with trees also planted in a symmetrical geometric shape. [[Royal Palace of Madrid#Plaza de Oriente|Plaza de Oriente]] can distinguish three main plots: the Central Gardens, the Cabo Noval Gardens and the Lepanto Gardens. The Central Gardens are arranged around the central monument to Philip IV, in a grid, following the barroque model garden. They consist of seven flowerbeds, each packed with box hedges, forms of cypress, yew and magnolia of small size, and flower plantations, temporary. These are bounded on either side by rows of statues paths, popularly known as the Gothic kings, and mark the dividing line between the main body of the plaza and the Cabo Noval Gardens at north, and the Lepanto Gardens at south.

Mount of [[El Pardo]] (''Monte de El Pardo'') is a mediterranean forest inside the city of Madrid. It is one of the best preserved [[Mediterranean Forests]] in Europe. The European Union has designated the Monte de El Pardo as a [[Special Protection Area]] for bird-life. This meadow, which has been used as hunting grounds by the royalty given the variety of game animals that have inhabited it since the Middle Ages, is home to 120 flora species and 200 vertebrae species. Rabbits, red partridges, wild cats, stags, deer and wild boars live among ilexes, cork oaks, ash trees, black poplars, oaks, junipers and rockroses. Monte del Pardo is part of the Regional Park of the High Basin of the Manzanares, spreading out from the [[Guadarrama Mountains]] range to the centre of Madrid, and protected by strong legal regulations. Just before crossing the city, the [[River Manzanares]] forms a valley composed by sandy elements and detritus from the mountain range.

Winters are cool due to its altitude, which is approximately {{cvt|667|m|0}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] and distance from the moderating effect of the sea. While mostly sunny, rain, sporadic snowfalls and frequent frosts can occur between December and February with cooler temperatures particularly during the night and mornings as cold winds blow into the city from surrounding mountains. Summers are hot and sunny, in the warmest month, July, average temperatures during the day range from {{cvt|32|to|34|C}} depending on location, with maxima commonly climbing over {{cvt|35|C}} and occasionally up to 40&nbsp;°C during the frequent heat waves. Due to Madrid's altitude and dry climate, humidity is low and [[Diurnal temperature variation|diurnal ranges]] are often significant, particularly on sunny winter days when the temperature rises in the afternoon before rapidly plummeting after nightfall. Madrid is among the sunniest capital cities in Europe.

===Water supply===
[[File:Comienza la restauración del Viaje de Agua de Amaniel para permitir visitas didácticas 04.jpg|thumb|right|Viaje de Amaniel]]
In the 17th century, the ''viajes de agua'' (a kind of water channel or ''[[qanat]]'') were used to provide water to the city. Some of the most important ones were the {{ill|Viaje de Amaniel|es|Viaje de Amaniel}} (1610–1621, sponsored by the Crown), the {{ill|Viaje de Fuente Castellana|es|Viaje de la Castellana}} (1613–1620) and {{ill|Abroñigal Alto|es|Abroñigal Alto}}/{{ill|Abroñigal Bajo|es|Bajo Abroñigal}} (1617–1630), sponsored by the City Council.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Madrid}}
[[File:Community of Madrid population pyramid in 2022.svg|thumb|[[Community of Madrid]] population pyramid in 2022]]
The population of Madrid has overall increased since the city became the capital of Spain in the mid-sixteenth century, and has stabilised at approximately 3,000,000 since the 1970s.

From 1970 until the mid-1990s, the population dropped. This phenomenon, which also affected other European cities, was caused in part by the growth of satellite suburbs at the expense of the downtown region within the city proper.

The [[Population growth|demographic boom]] accelerated in the late-1990s and early first decade of the 21st century due to [[immigration]] in parallel with a surge in Spanish [[economic growth]].

The wider Madrid region is the EU region with the highest average life expectancy at birth. The average life expectancy was 82.2 years for males and 87.8 for females in 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Population_statistics_at_regional_level |title=Population statistics at regional level – Statistics Explained |website=ec.europa.eu |access-date=18 December 2018 |archive-date=29 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181129012838/https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Population_statistics_at_regional_level |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Madrid}}
[[File:Interior del Palacio de la Bolsa, Madrid, España, 2017 29.jpg|thumb|The [[Bolsa de Madrid|Madrid Stock Exchange]]]]
After it became the capital of Spain in the 16th century, Madrid was more a centre of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] than of production or trade. Economic activity was largely devoted to supplying the city's own rapidly growing population, including the royal household and national government, and to such trades as [[bank]]ing and [[publishing]].

A large [[industrial sector]] did not develop until the 20th century, but thereafter industry greatly expanded and diversified, making Madrid the second industrial city in Spain. However, the economy of the city is now becoming more and more dominated by the [[tertiary sector of the economy|service sector]]. A major European financial center, its stock market is the third largest stock market in Europe featuring both the [[IBEX 35]] index and the attached {{ill|Latibex|es}} stock market (with the second most important index for [[Latin America]]n companies).<ref name="Moreno-Fernández"/>{{rp|45}}

Madrid is the 5th most important leading Centre of Commerce in Europe (after London, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam) and ranks 11th in the world.<ref name="mastercard.com"/> It is the leading Spanish-speaking city in terms of webpage creation.<ref name="Moreno-Fernández"/>{{rp|45}}

===Economic history===
As the capital city of the [[Spanish Empire]] from 1561, Madrid's population grew rapidly. Administration, banking, and small-scale manufacturing centred on the royal court were among the main activities, but the city was more a locus of consumption than production or trade, geographically isolated as it was before the coming of the railways.

The [[Bank of Spain]] is one of the oldest European central banks. Originally named as the Bank of San Carlos as it was founded in 1782, it was later renamed to Bank of San Fernando in 1829 and ultimately became the Bank of Spain in 1856.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/SES/Secciones/Publicaciones/PublicacionesSeriadas/EstudiosHistoriaEconomica/Files/roja73e.pdf |page=1 |first=Pablo |last=Martín-Aceña |title=The Banco de España, 1782–2017.

{{Main|Architecture of Madrid}}
{{more citations needed section|date=January 2015}}
Little medieval architecture is preserved in Madrid, mostly in the [[Almendra Central]], including the [[Church of San Nicolás (Madrid)|San Nicolás]] and [[San Pedro el Real, Madrid|San Pedro el Viejo]] church towers, the church of [[San Jerónimo el Real]], and the [[Chapel of Obispo de Madrid|Bishop's Chapel]]. Nor has Madrid retained much Renaissance architecture, other than the [[Bridge of Segovia (Madrid)|Bridge of Segovia]] and the [[Convent of Las Descalzas Reales]].
[[File:Plaza Mayor de Madrid - 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Plaza Mayor, Madrid|Plaza Mayor]], built in the 16th century]]
Philip II moved his court to Madrid in 1561 and transformed the town into a capital city. During the Early Habsburg period, the import of European influences took place, underpinned by the monicker of ''Austrian style''. The Austrian style featured not only Austrian influences but also Italian and Dutch (as well as Spanish), reflecting on the international preeminence of the Habsburgs.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Arquitectura y espacio urbano en Madrid en los siglos XVII y XVIII |year=2007 |first=Jesús<!-- |pages=50–65--> |last=Escobar |publisher=[[Ayuntamiento de Madrid]] |chapter=Arquitectura y urbanismo en el Madrid del siglo XVII: proceso, adorno y experiencia |url=https://www.madrid.es/UnidadesDescentralizadas/MuseosMunicipales/MuseoDeHistoriaDeMadrid/EspecialInformativo/05_Publicaciones/ConferenciasArquitectura/conferenciasarquitectura2.pdf |page=54 |access-date=5 February 2020 |archive-date=18 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210418092352/https://www.madrid.es/UnidadesDescentralizadas/MuseosMunicipales/MuseoDeHistoriaDeMadrid/EspecialInformativo/05_Publicaciones/ConferenciasArquitectura/conferenciasarquitectura2.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref> During the second half of the 16th century, the use of pointy slate [[spire]]s in order to top structures such as church towers was imported to Spain from Central Europe.<ref>{{Cite book |page=4 |url=http://oa.upm.es/43387/1/RAIMUNDO_ESTEPA_GOMEZ_01.pdf |publisher=[[Universidad Politécnica de Madrid]] |location=Madrid |title=Chapiteles del siglo XVI al XVIII en Madrid y su entorno: sus armaduras de madera |last=Estepa Gómez |first=Raimundo |year=2015 |access-date=4 February 2020 |archive-date=4 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200204233859/http://oa.upm.es/43387/1/RAIMUNDO_ESTEPA_GOMEZ_01.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref> Slate spires and roofs consequently became a staple of the Madrilenian architecture at the time.<ref name=lib>{{Cite web |url=https://www.edicioneslalibreria.es/arquitectura-en-el-madrid-de-los-austrias/ |publisher=Ediciones La Librería |title=Arquitectura en el Madrid de los Austrias |date=18 January 2016 |access-date=4 February 2020 |archive-date=4 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200204235404/https://www.edicioneslalibreria.es/arquitectura-en-el-madrid-de-los-austrias/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

Stand out architecture in the city dating back to the early 17th century includes several buildings and structures (most of them attributed to [[Juan Gómez de Mora]]) such as the [[Palacio de los Concejos|Palace of the Duke of Uceda]] (1610), the [[Royal Monastery of La Encarnación|Monastery of La Encarnación]] (1611–1616); the [[Plaza Mayor de Madrid|Plaza Mayor]] (1617–1619) or the ''Cárcel de Corte'' (1629–1641), currently known as the [[Santa Cruz Palace, Madrid|Santa Cruz Palace]].{{Sfn|Blasco Esquivias|2016|p=280}} The century also saw the construction of the former City Hall, the [[Casa de la Villa]].{{sfn|Escobar|2007|pp=60–63}}

The [[Colegio Imperial de Madrid|Imperial College]] church model dome was imitated in all of Spain. [[Pedro de Ribera]] introduced [[Churrigueresque]] architecture to Madrid; the [[Cuartel del Conde-Duque]], the [[Our Lady of Montserrat Church, Madrid|church of Montserrat]], and the [[Bridge of Toledo (Madrid)|Bridge of Toledo]] are among the best examples.
[[File:Palacio Real Jardines.jpg|thumb|right|[[Royal Palace of Madrid]], built in the 18th century]]
The reign of [[Bourbon Spain|the Bourbons]] during the eighteenth century marked a new era in the city. [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] tried to complete King Philip II's vision of urbanisation of Madrid. Philip V built a palace in line with French taste, as well as other buildings such as [[St. Michael's Basilica (Madrid)|St. Michael's Basilica]] and the [[Church of Santa Barbara, Madrid|Church of Santa Bárbara]]. King [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] beautified the city and endeavoured to convert Madrid into one of the great European capitals. He pushed forward the construction of the Prado Museum (originally intended as a Natural Science Museum), the [[Puerta de Alcalá]], the [[Royal Observatory of Madrid|Royal Observatory]], the [[Basilica of San Francisco el Grande]], the Casa de Correos in [[Puerta del Sol]], the [[Real Casa de la Aduana]], and the General Hospital (which now houses the Reina Sofia Museum and Royal Conservatory of Music). The [[Paseo del Prado]], surrounded by gardens and decorated with neoclassical statues, is an example of urban planning. The [[Duke of Berwick]] ordered the construction of the [[Liria Palace]].

During the early 19th century, the [[Peninsular War]], the [[Spanish American wars of independence|loss of viceroyalties]] in the Americas, and continuing coups limited the city's architectural development ([[Teatro Real|Royal Theatre]], the [[Biblioteca Nacional de España|National Library of Spain]], the Palace of the Senate, and the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)#Congress of Deputies building|Congress]]).

From the mid-19th century until the Civil War, Madrid modernised and built new neighbourhoods and monuments. The expansion of Madrid developed under the [[Ensanche|Plan Castro]], resulting in the neighbourhoods of [[Salamanca (Madrid)|Salamanca]], [[Moncloa-Aravaca|Argüelles]], and [[Chamberí]]. [[Arturo Soria]] conceived the [[Linear city (Soria design)|linear city]] and built the first few kilometres of the road that bears his name, which embodies the idea. The [[Gran Vía (Madrid)|Gran Vía]] was built using different styles that evolved over time: French style, eclectic, art deco, and expressionist. However, [[Art Nouveau in Madrid]], known as ''Modernismo'' did also develop at the turn of the century, in concert with its appearance elsewhere in Europe, including [[Barcelona]] and [[Valencia]]. [[Antonio Palacios]] built a series of buildings inspired by the [[Viennese Secession]], such as the [[Palace of Communication]], the [[Círculo de Bellas Artes]], and the [[Río de La Plata Bank]] (now [[Instituto Cervantes]]). Other notable buildings include the [[Bank of Spain]], the neo-Gothic [[Almudena Cathedral]], [[Atocha Station]], and the Catalan art-nouveau [[Palace of Longoria]]. [[Las Ventas]] Bullring was built, as the [[Market of San Miguel]] (Cast-Iron style).

Following the Francoist takeover that ensued the end of Spanish Civil war, architecture experienced an involution, discarding rationalism and, eclecticism notwithstanding, going back to an overall rather "outmoded" architectural language, with the purpose of turning Madrid into a capital worthy of the "Immortal Spain".<ref name=torrus>{{Cite web |url=https://www.publico.es/politica/huella-del-fascismo-patrio-arquitectura.html |website=[[Público (Spain)|Público]] |title=La huella del fascismo patrio en la arquitectura de Madrid |date=13 January 2017 |first=Alejandro |last=Torrús |access-date=6 February 2020 |archive-date=6 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200206032108/https://www.publico.es/politica/huella-del-fascismo-patrio-arquitectura.html |url-status=live}}</ref> Iconic examples of this period include the [[General Headquarters of the Air and Space Force|Ministry of the Air]] (a case of [[herrerian]] revival) and the [[Edificio España]] (presented as the tallest building in Europe when it was inaugurated in 1953).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hoy.es/v/20110223/sociedad/simbolo-centro-madrid-20110223.html |website=Hoy |date=23 February 2011 |title=Un símbolo en el centro de Madrid |first=Julián |last=Méndez |access-date=6 February 2020 |archive-date=21 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220521054401/https://www.hoy.es/v/20110223/sociedad/simbolo-centro-madrid-20110223.html |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=torrus /> Many of these buildings distinctly combine the use of brick and stone in the façades.<ref name=torrus /> The [[Casa Sindical]] marked a breaking point as it was the first to reassume rationalism, although that relinking to modernity was undertaken through the imitation of the Italian Fascist architecture.<ref name=torrus />

With the advent of Spanish economic development, skyscrapers, such as [[Torre Picasso]], Torres Blancas and Torre BBVA, and the [[Gate of Europe]], appeared in the late 20th century in the city. During the decade of the 2000s, the four tallest skyscrapers in Spain were built and together form the [[Cuatro Torres Business Area]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://elpais.com/diario/2007/08/12/negocio/1186923803_850215.html/ |title=La altura sí importa |work=Architecture |access-date=18 September 2018 |language=ES |archive-date=17 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417011639/http://elpais.com/diario/2007/08/12/negocio/1186923803_850215.html |url-status=live}}</ref> Terminal 4 at [[Madrid-Barajas Airport]] was inaugurated in 2006 and won several architectural awards.

The usual language in Madrid is [[Peninsular Spanish]].
It is in the transition between northern and southern dialects.
Typical features are:

* {{lang|es-ES|[[leísmo]]}}, {{lang|es-ES|[[laísmo]]}} and {{lang|es-ES|[[loísmo]]}}. According to {{ill|Samuel Gili Gaya|es}}, in Madrid speech, pronoun {{lang|es-ES|le}} is specialized in the masculine and pronoun {{lang|es-ES|la}} in the feminine, for direct and indirect objects.<ref name="Gili">Citado en Quilis, ''Los Pronombres "le", "la", "lo" y sus plurales en la lengua española hablada en Madrid '', pag. 36. <br /> ''Según Gili Gaya (1958, 210-211), el 'le' dativo, que, como se sabe, es invariable para los 2 géneros, se ha especializado como masculino: 'le regalaron una bicicleta' (a él); y cuando es femeninose sustituye por 'la', procedente del acusativo: la regalaron una bicicleta' (a ella). "Este es el uso madrileño espontáneo en todas las clases sociales, a no ser entre personas cuya instrucción gramatical, o la procedencia de otras regiones, lo corrija más o menos. La influencia de la capital irradia su laísmo hacia otras provincias del Centro y del Norte, llegando a vencer a menudo la resistencia del lenguaje literario. El vulgo madrileño va todavía más allá: el 'lo' sustituye con frecuencia a 'le' como dativo: 'lo pegaron una bofetada'. Sin embargo, este 'loísmo' se siente en todas partes como extremadamente plebeyo, y no ha logrado salir del habla achulapada."''</ref>

The arrival to Madrid of a substantial number of immigrants from [[Latin America]] (such as [[Ecuadorians]]) has induced processes of dialectal convergence and divergence in the city.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter=El español y sus variedades en el espacio global|first=Andrew|last=Lynch|pages=610–611|title=Dialectología hispánica.

===Literature===
Madrid has been one of the great centres of [[Spanish literature]]. Some of the most distinguished writers of the [[Spanish Golden Age|Spanish Golden Century]] were born in Madrid, including [[Lope de Vega]] (author of ''[[Fuenteovejuna]]'' and ''[[The Dog in the Manger (play)|The Dog in the Manger]]''), who reformed the Spanish theatre, a project continued by [[Calderon de la Barca]] (author of ''[[Life is a Dream]]''). [[Francisco de Quevedo]], who criticised the Spanish society of his day, and author of ''[[El Buscón]]'', and [[Tirso de Molina]], who created the character [[Don Juan]], were born in Madrid. [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]] and [[Luis de Góngora|Góngora]] also lived in the city, although they were not born there. The Madrid homes of Lope de Vega, Quevedo, Gongora, and Cervantes still exist, and they are all in the Barrio de las Letras (Literary Neighborhood). Other writers born in Madrid in later centuries have been [[Leandro Fernandez de Moratín]], [[Mariano José de Larra]], [[Jose de Echegaray]] ([[Nobel Prize in Literature]]), [[Ramón Gómez de la Serna]], [[Dámaso Alonso]], [[Enrique Jardiel Poncela]] and [[Pedro Salinas]].

The "Barrio de las Letras" owes its name to the intense literary activity taking place there during the 16th and 17th centuries.

===Bullfighting===
Madrid hosts the largest ''plaza de toros'' (bullring) in Spain, [[Las Ventas]], established in 1929. Las Ventas is considered by many to be the world centre of bullfighting and has a [[seating capacity]] of almost 25,000. Madrid's [[bullfighting]] season begins in March and ends in October. Bullfights are held every day during the festivities of [[Isidore the Laborer|San Isidro]] (Madrid's [[patron saint]]) from mid May to early June, and every Sunday, and [[holiday|public holiday]], the rest of the season. The style of the plaza is [[Neo-Mudéjar]]. Las Ventas also hosts music concerts and other events outside of the bullfighting season.

===Universities===
Madrid is home to many public and [[Private university|private universities]]. Some of them are among the oldest in the world, and many of them are the most prestigious universities in Spain.

The [[Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia|National Distance Education University]] (''Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia''; UNED) has as its mission the public service of higher education through the modality of distance education. At more than 205,000 students (2015), UNED has the largest student population in Spain and is one of the largest universities in Europe. Since 1972, UNED has sought to translate into action the principle of equal opportunity in access to higher education through a methodology based on the principles of distance learning and focused on the needs of the student.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

[[File:Rectorado de la Universidad Complutense de Madrid.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The rectorate of the [[Complutense University of Madrid]]]]
The [[Complutense University of Madrid]] (''Universidad Complutense de Madrid''; UCM) is the second largest university in Spain after UNED and one of the oldest universities in the world. It has over 11,000 staff members and a student population of 117,000. Most of the academic staff is Spanish. It is located on two campuses, the main one of [[Ciudad Universitaria de Madrid|Ciudad Universitaria]] in the [[Moncloa-Aravaca]] district, and the secondary campus of Somosaguas, located outside the city limits in [[Pozuelo de Alarcón]] and founded in 1971.<ref>{{Cite journal |page=190 |title=Universidad y territorio en el área metropolitana de Madrid |first1=Guillermo |last1=Morales Matos |first2=Daniel |last2=Marías Martínez |journal=Ería |publisher=[[University of Oviedo]] |volume=80 |year=2009 |issn=0211-0563 |url=https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/3211759.pdf |access-date=19 December 2018 |archive-date=19 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181219182705/https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/3211759.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Universidad Complutense">{{cite news |url=http://www.umsl.edu/services/abroad/universities/complutense.html |publisher=Missouri-St. Louis University |title=Universidad Complutense |date=10 July 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703182606/http://www.umsl.edu/services/abroad/universities/complutense.html |archive-date=3 July 2006 }}</ref> The Complutense University of Madrid was founded in [[Alcalá de Henares]], old Complutum, by Cardinal Cisneros in 1499. Nevertheless, its real origin dates back to 1293, when King [[Sancho IV of Castile]] built the General Schools of Alcalá, which would give rise to Cisnero's Complutense University. Between 1509 and 1510, five schools were already operative: ''Artes y Filosofía'' (Arts and Philosophy), ''Teología'' (Theology), ''Derecho Canónico'' (Canonical Laws), ''Letras'' (Liberal Arts) and ''Medicina'' (Medicine). In 1836, during the reign of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabel II]], the university was moved to Madrid, where it took the name of Central University and was located at San Bernardo Street. Subsequently, in 1927, a new [[University City of Madrid|University City]] (Ciudad Universitaria) was planned to be built in the district of Moncloa-Aravaca, in lands handed over by the King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]] to this purpose. The [[Spanish Civil War]] turned the University City into a war zone, causing the destruction of several schools in the area, as well as the loss of part of its rich scientific, artistic and bibliographic heritage. In 1970 the Government reformed higher education, and the Central University became the Complutense University of Madrid. It was then that the new campus at Somosaguas was created to house the new School of Social Sciences. The old Alcalá campus was reopened as the independent UAH, [[University of Alcalá]], in 1977. Complutense also serves a population of students who select Madrid for their [[study abroad]] period. Students from the United States, for example, might go to Madrid on a program like API (Academic Programs International) and study at Complutense for an intense immersion in the Spanish language. After studying at the university, students return home with fluency in Spanish as well as an enhanced understanding of culture and diversity.<ref name="Universidad Complutense de Madrid">{{cite news |url=http://portal.ucm.es/en/web/en-ucm/seven-centuries-of-history |publisher=UCM |title=Complutense University of Madrid |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316165924/http://portal.ucm.es/en/web/en-ucm/seven-centuries-of-history |archive-date=16 March 2011}}</ref>

The [[Technical University of Madrid]] (''Universidad Politécnica de Madrid''; UPM), is the top technical university in Spain. It is the result of the merger of different [[Technical school|Technical Schools]] of Engineering. It shares the Ciudad Universitaria campus with the UCM, while it also owns several schools scattered in the city centre and additional campuses in the [[Puente de Vallecas]] district and in the neighbouring municipality of [[Boadilla del Monte]].

The [[Autonomous University of Madrid]] (''Universidad Autónoma de Madrid''; UAM) was instituted under the leadership of the physicist, [[Nicolás Cabrera (physicist)|Nicolás Cabrera]]. The Autonomous University is widely recognised for its research strengths in [[theoretical physics]]. Known simply as ''La Autónoma'' by locals, its main site is the Cantoblanco Campus, located in the north of the municipality, close to its boundaries with the neighbouring municipalities of [[Alcobendas]], [[San Sebastián de los Reyes]] and [[Tres Cantos]].

===Business schools===
[[File:IE Business School17.JPG|thumb|right|Students of the IE Business School]]
[[IE Business School]] (formerly Instituto de Empresa) has its main campus on the border of the Chamartín and Salamanca districts of Madrid. IE Business School recently ranked #1 in WSJ's 2009 rankings for Best MBA Programs under 2 years. It scored ahead of usual stalwarts, [[INSEAD]] and [[International Institute for Management Development|IMD]], giving it top billing among International MBA programs. Although based in [[Barcelona]], both [[IESE|IESE Business School]] and [[ESADE Business School]] also have Madrid campuses. These three schools are the top-ranked [[business school]]s in Spain, consistently rank among the top 20 business schools globally, and offer [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] programs (in English or Spanish) as well as other business degrees. Madrid is a good destination for business schools and a city much desired by foreign students. The most important Spanish business schools (IESE, IE, ESADE) have invested 125&nbsp;million euros in expanding their campuses in Madrid in 2020.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sánchez-Silva |first=Carmen |url=https://elpais.com/economia/2020/02/13/actualidad/1581615936_819890.html |title=Las escuelas de negocios expanden sus redes en Madrid |date=16 February 2020 |work=El País |access-date=20 February 2020 |language=es |issn=1134-6582 |archive-date=20 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200220113145/https://elpais.com/economia/2020/02/13/actualidad/1581615936_819890.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

Madrid is served by several roads and three modes of public surface transport, and two airports, one of them being almost two different airports. A great many important road, rail and air links converge on the capital, providing effective connections with other parts of the metropolitan region and with the rest of Spain and other parts of Europe.

In the 1960s, sweeping urban reforms were promoted to accommodate Madrid to the private car (most notably the removal of boulevards and the incorporation of overpasses), in some ways similarly to other European cities, but in the distinct context of poverty of public debate, which was limited by a dictatorship putting its own interests and those of its clientelist networks before other concerns when it came to alter the urban fabric, thereby marginizalizing the pedestrian.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=|journal=Culture & History Digital Journal|volume=12|issue=1|year=2023|issn=2253-797X|doi=10.3989/chdj.2023.01|title=La modernización durante el franquismo: urbanismo, tráfico y descontento social en Madrid (1957-1973)|first=Marcos|last=Prados Martín|doi-broken-date=1 November 2024 }}</ref>

;Radial roads
[[File:Red alta capacidad españa.svg|thumb|right|The network of high capacity roads in Spain features its most important node in Madrid.]]
Madrid is the centre of the most important roads of Spain. Already in 1720, the ''Reglamento General de Postas'' enacted by [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] configurated the basis of a radial system of roads in the country.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.madrid.org/bvirtual/BVCM000078.pdf |page=64 |title=Madrid y los Borbones en el siglo XVIII.

Madrid features a number of the most prominent ''[[autovía]]s'' (fast dualled highways), part of the {{ill|State Road Network|es|Red de Carreteras del Estado}}. Clock-wise starting from the north: the [[Autovía A-1|A-1]] (Madrid–[[Irún]]–[[France|French border]]), [[Autovía A-2|A-2]] (Madrid–[[Zaragoza]]–[[Barcelona]]–French border), [[Autovía A-3|A-3]] (Madrid–[[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]), [[Autovía A-4|A-4]] (Madrid–[[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]]–[[Sevilla]]–[[Cádiz]]), [[Autovía A-5|A-5]] (Madrid–[[Badajoz]]–[[Portugal|Portuguese border]]) and the [[Autovía A-6|A-6]] (Madrid–[[A Coruña]]). The [[Autovía A-42|A-42]], another highway connecting Madrid to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], is also part of the State Network.

The [[M-607]] connects Madrid to the [[Puerto de Navacerrada]]. It is a fast dualled highway in its initial stretch from Madrid to [[Colmenar Viejo]], and part of the {{ill|Regional Road Network|es|Anexo:Red de Carreteras de la Comunidad de Madrid}} (in relation to the concerning administration, not to the technical features of the road).

Due to the large amount of traffic, new toll highways were built parallel to the main national freeways. Their names are {{ill|R-2 motorway (Spain)|lt=R-2|es|Autopista Radial 2}}, [[R-3 motorway (Spain)|R-3]], [[R-4 motorway (Spain)|R-4]] and {{ill|R-5 motorway (Spain)|lt=R-5|es|Autopista Radial 5}} and they were intended to provide a paid alternative to the often overcrowded free radials. However, except the R-3, they do not end close to the M-30 innermost ring road, as the R-2 finishes in the M-40, the R-4 in the M-50 and the R-5 in the M-40.

;Orbital roads
[[File:M 30 tunel.jpg|thumb|M-30 tunnel parallel to the Manzanares]]
Also Madrid road network includes four [[ring road|orbital]] ones at different distances from the centre. The innermost ring-road, the [[Autopista de Circunvalación M-30|M-30]], is the only one with its path strictly located within the Madrid municipal limits. It is owned by the [[Madrid City Council]] and operated by Madrid Calle 30, S.A. It is the busiest Spanish road, famous for its traffic jams. A significant portion of the southern part runs underground parallel to the [[Manzanares River|Manzanares]], with tunnel sections of more than {{cvt|6|km|abbr=off}} in length and 3 to 6 lanes in each direction.

The second ring-road, the [[Autopista de Circunvalación M-40|M-40]] (part of the State Road Network) circles the city, while also extending to other surrounding municipalities. A NW stretch of the road runs underground, below the southern reaches of the [[Monte de El Pardo]] protected area.

The [[Autopista de Circunvalación M-45|M-45]] partially circles the city, connecting the M-40 and M-50, passing through areas like Villaverde and Vallecas in the southeast of the municipality.

The [[Autopista de Circunvalación M-50|M-50]], the Madrid's outer ring road, connects municipalities and cities in the metropolitan area, like [[Fuenlabrada]], [[Móstoles]], [[Getafe]], [[Leganés]] in the south and [[Boadilla del Monte]] and [[Las Rozas de Madrid|Las Rozas]] in the west.

;Cercanías
{{Main|Cercanías Madrid}}
Cercanías Madrid is the [[commuter rail]] service used for longer distances from the suburbs and beyond into Madrid, consisting of nine lines totalling {{cvt|578|km|abbr=off}} and more than 90 stations. With fewer stops inside the centre of the city they are faster than the Metro, but run less frequently. This system is connected with Metro (presently 22 stations) and Light Metro. The lines are named: [[C-1 (Cercanías Madrid)|C-1]], [[C-2 (Cercanías Madrid)|C-2]], [[C-3 (Cercanías Madrid)|C-3]], [[C-4 (Cercanías Madrid)|C-4]], [[C-5 (Cercanías Madrid)|C-5]], [[C-7 (Cercanías Madrid)|C-7]], [[C-8 (Cercanías Madrid)|C-8]], [[C-9 (Cercanías Madrid)|C-9]], [[C-10 (Cercanías Madrid)|C-10]], respectively.

;Buses
There is a dense network of [[bus]] routes, run by the municipal company [[Empresa Municipal de Transportes de Madrid|Empresa Municipal de Transportes]] (or EMT Madrid), which operates 24 hours a day; special services called "N lines" are run during nighttime. The special Airport Express Shuttle line connecting the airport with the city centre features distinctively yellow buses. In addition to the urban lines operated by the EMT, the green buses (''interurbanos'') connect the city with the suburbs. The later lines, while also regulated by the CRTM, are often run by private operators.

Almost half of all journeys in the metropolitan area are made on public transport, a very high proportion compared with most European cities.<ref name=Estructura/>{{rp|62–4}}
Madrid has 15723 taxis around all the city.

;Taxi
The taxicabs are regulated by a specific sub-division of taxi service, a body dependent of the [[Madrid City Council]]. The authorisation entails a badge for the vehicle and a license for the driver, who has to be older than 18.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Skok |first1=Walter |last2=Martinez |first2=Juan Antonio |year=2010 |title=An international taxi cab evaluation: Comparing Madrid with London, New York, and Paris |journal=Knowledge and Process Management |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=145–153 |doi=10.1002/kpm.346 |url=http://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/15622/ |access-date=5 May 2021 |archive-date=26 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426101454/http://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/15622/ |url-status=live}}</ref> Since the 1970s, the fleet of taxis has remained stable roughly around {{nts|16000}} vehicles, accounting for {{nts|15600}} in 2014.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.eleconomista.es/emprendedores-pymes/noticias/6089760/09/14/Gastos-e-ingresos-de-los-taxistas-profesionales.html |title=Los gastos y los ingresos de los taxistas profesionales |date=19 September 2014 |journal=El Economista |access-date=16 September 2019 |archive-date=3 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803131131/https://www.eleconomista.es/emprendedores-pymes/noticias/6089760/09/14/Gastos-e-ingresos-de-los-taxistas-profesionales.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

In terms of longer-distance transport, Madrid is the central node of the system of ''[[autovía]]s'', giving the city direct fast road links with most parts of Spain and with France and Portugal. It is also the focal point of one of the world's three largest [[high-speed rail]] systems, ''Alta Velocidad Española'' ([[AVE]]), which has brought major cities such as Seville and Barcelona within 2.5 hours' travel time. There are now {{cvt|2,900|km|abbr=off}} of AVE track, connecting Madrid with 17 provincial capitals, and further lines are under construction.<ref name=Estructura/>{{rp|72–75}}

Spanish companies are designing new high-speed trains which will be the new-generation [[AVE]], much like the current [[Talgo AVRIL]].

Aside from the local and regional bus commuting services, Madrid is also a node for long-distance bus connections to many national destinations.
