==Legend==
[[File:Shwe Yin Myaw.jpg|left|thumb|Statues of the dragon and frog]]
Legend has it that Hpa-An was created by the dragon king and the frog king. King Mandu (မဏ္ဍုဖားမင်းကြီး), a giant frog lived the top of the [[Mount Hpan Pu]]. One day, while out searching for food, he saw a large magic ruby with an emerald club placed on the throne in the foot cave of Mount Hpan Pu, and the frog king thought the ruby was his food and swallowed it. He gained powers by swallowing the magic ruby and was able to resist his enemy, the dragon king. The place where the dragon king vomited the frog king is called [[Hpa-An]] (lit. 'vomit frog').<ref name="s">{{cite news |title=ဖားပုတောင်ပေါ်မှ လှပသောမြင်ကွင်းတစ်ခွင် |url=https://mrtv.gov.mm/en/news-147365 |work=Myanma Radio and Television |date=22 April 2022 |language=en}}</ref> The impressive statues of these figures can be seen in the [[Shwe Yin Myaw Pagoda]]'s compound.

==Climate==
Hpa-An has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Am''). Temperatures are very warm throughout the year, although maximum temperatures are somewhat depressed in the monsoon season due to heavy cloud and rain. There is a winter dry season (November–April) and a summer wet season (May–October). Torrential rain falls from June to September, with over {{convert|1100|mm|in}} falling in July and August alone.

[[Kayin State Cultural Museum]] is located in Hpa-An. [[Mount Zwegabin]] and [[Mount Taung Wine]] are attractive places for visitors, as well as [[Kyauk Ka Lat Pagoda]] in which the sacred hair relic of Buddha is enshrined. Hpa An is famous for many limestone caves, like
*Bayin Nyi Naung Cave,
*Yathae Byan Cave, 
*[[Kawgon Cave]] (or Kawgoon Cave), 
*Kaw-ka-thaung Cave and
*[[Saddan Cave]]

Such caves are well worth visiting because of their incredibly beautiful landscapes and ancient Buddha images and other cultural items in them which were once less known due to regional instability.
