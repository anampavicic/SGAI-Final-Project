'''Salalah''' ({{langx|ar|صَلَالَة|Ṣalālah}}) is the capital and largest city of the southern [[Oman]]i [[Governorates of Oman|governorate]] of [[Dhofar Governorate|Dhofar]]. It has a population close to 331,949.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Oman: Administrative Division (Governorates and Districts) - Population Statistics, Charts and Map |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/oman/admin/ |access-date=2023-11-03 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref>

Salalah is the third-largest city in the [[Sultanate of Oman]], and the largest city in the Dhofar province. Salalah is the birthplace of former Omani [[Sultans of Oman|Sultan]] [[Qaboos bin Said al Said|Qaboos bin Said]]. Salalah attracts many tourists from other parts of Oman and from abroad during the [[monsoon]]/''[[khareef]]'' season, from June to September. The [[climate]] of the region and the [[monsoon]] allow the city to grow some vegetables and fruits like coconut and bananas. There are many gardens within the city where these vegetables and fruits grow.

==History==
{{Unreferenced|section |date=April 2024}}
Salalah was the traditional capital of [[Dhofar]], which reached the peak of prosperity in the 13th century thanks to the [[incense]] trade. Later it decayed, and in the 19th century it was absorbed by the Sultanate of [[Muscat and Oman]].

Between 1932 and 1970, Salalah was the residence of Sultan [[Said bin Taimur]]. His son, [[Qaboos bin Said al Said|Qaboos]], who acceded to his father's throne in 1970, decided to move his [[capital (political)|capital]] to Muscat, the largest city in Oman, where he lived until he quietly left for treatment in Germany. Sultan Qaboos's absence was much regretted in Salalah, where his palace was always kept ready to receive him. His last visits were in 2006 to meet influential [[tribe|tribal]] and local leaders, and in 2010 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of his accession with a massive parade watched for several hours by an estimated 100,000 spectators.
 
Despite the Sultan's generally benevolent government running Oman without national taxation, thanks to its vast mineral resources, and with all menial work done by Asian labourers, Salalah saw peaceful protests for a few months in 2011 in the [[domino effect]] of the [[Arab Spring]]. Some Omani protesters demanded the dismissal of current ministers, better job opportunities, salary increases, a solution to the increasing cost of living, or the establishment of [[Islamic banking|Islamic banks]].

==Climate==
[[File:Salalah during khareef.jpg|thumb|right|Salalah during Khareef Season (June to September)]]
The city has a hot [[desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh''), although summers are cooler than in more northern or inland parts of Oman. Salalah is very cloudy and foggy during the [[monsoon]] months of July and August, even though it receives relatively little rainfall. [[Khareef|Khareef, خريف]] means "autumn" in Arabic, but it refers to monsoon when describing the region around Salalah. During this time, the brown landscape of Salalah and its surroundings are completely transformed to beautiful and lush green scenes. This provides picturesque scenes for photos. 

[[Cyclone Mekunu]], which originated over the Arabian Sea, became an extremely severe cyclone before hitting the Salalah city on 25&nbsp;May 2018. 200 km/was the recorded windspeed, and the city of Salalah was pounded with over {{convert|617|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rainfall, which is almost 5 years of Oman's average rainfall.<ref name="Weather Salalah">{{cite web |title=Weather Salalah |url=https://gosalalahtour.com/weather-salalah |website=Go Salalah Tour |date=15 April 2023 |access-date=16 May 2023}}</ref>

It is also the largest private employer in the [[Dhofar]] region. The Salalah Free Zone, situated right beside the port, is emerging as a new center for heavy industries in the Middle East.

[[Dhofar (football club)|Dhofar F.C.]] have been nicknamed as "''Al-Zaeem''", or "The Leader(s)", due to their enormous success in both the [[Omani League]], and in the [[Sultan Qaboos Cup]].

Oman National Transport Company (Mwasalat) has started daily public bus service in Salalah from December 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.travelwithhussain.com/salalah-public-bus-service-mwasalat/|title=Salalah Public Bus Service - Mwasalat|date=2018-12-26|website=Travel with Hussain|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-02}}</ref>
