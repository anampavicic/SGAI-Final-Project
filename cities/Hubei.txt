During the [[Warring States period]] (475–221 BC) Chu became the major adversary of the upstart [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]] to the northwest (in present-day [[Guanzhong]], [[Shaanxi]] province), which began to assert itself by outward expansionism. As wars between Qin and Chu ensued, Chu lost more and more land: first its dominance over the [[Sichuan Basin]], then (in 278 BC) its heartland, which correspond to modern Hubei.<ref>《[[Han Feizi|韩非子]]·初见秦》：秦与荆人战，大破荆，袭郢，取洞庭、五渚、江南。荆王君臣亡走，东服于陈。</ref><ref>《[[Records of the Grand Historian|史记]]·卷七十三·白起王翦列传》：其明年，攻楚，拔郢，烧夷陵，遂东至竟陵。楚王亡去郢，东走徙陈。</ref> In 223 BC Qin chased down the remnants of the Chu regime, which had fled eastwards [[Qin's wars of unification|during Qin's wars of uniting China]].<ref>《[[Records of the Grand Historian|史记]]·卷七十三·白起王翦列传》：王翦果代李信击荆。荆闻王翦益军而来，乃悉国中兵以拒秦。王翦至，坚壁而守之，不肯战。荆兵数出挑战，终不出。王翦日休士洗沐，而善饮食抚循之，亲与士卒同食。久之，王翦使人问军中戏乎？对曰：“方投石超距。”于是王翦曰：“士卒可用矣。”荆数挑战而秦不出，乃引而东。翦因举兵追之，令壮士击，大破荆军。至蕲南，杀其将军项燕，荆兵遂败走。秦因乘胜略定荆地城邑。岁馀，虏荆王负刍，竟平荆地为郡县。。</ref>

Qin founded the [[Qin dynasty]] in 221 BC, the first unified dynasty in [[China proper|China]]. The Qin dynasty was succeeded in 206 BC by the [[Han dynasty]], which established the province ([[zhou (political division)|''zhou'']]) of [[Jingzhou province|Jingzhou]] in today's Hubei and [[Hunan]]. The Qin and Han played an active role in the extension of farmland in Hubei, maintaining a system of river dikes to protect farms from summer floods.<ref>Brian Lander.

Liu Bei then took control of Jingzhou and appointed Guan Yu as administrator of Xiangyang (in modern [[Xiangyang, Hubei]]) to guard Jing province; he went on to conquer Yizhou (the Sichuan Basin), but lost Jingzhou to Sun Quan; for the next few decades Jingzhou was controlled by the [[Eastern Wu|Wu Kingdom]], ruled by Sun Quan and his successors.<ref>《[[Records of the Three Kingdoms|三国志]]·吴书·卷54/周瑜鲁肃吕蒙传·吕蒙传》：蒙入据城，尽得羽及将士家属，皆抚慰，约令军中不得干历人家，有所求取。蒙麾下士，是汝南人，取民家一笠，以覆官铠，官铠虽公，蒙犹以为犯军令，不可以乡里故而废法，遂垂涕斩之。于是军中震栗，道不拾遗。蒙旦暮使亲近存恤耆老，问所不足，疾病者给医药，饥寒者赐衣粮。羽府藏财宝，皆封闭以待权至。羽还，在道路，数使人与蒙相闻，蒙辄厚遇其使，周游城中，家家致问，或手书示信。羽人还，私相参讯，咸知家门无恙，见待过于平时，故羽吏士无鬬心。会权寻至，羽自知孤穷，乃走麦城，西至漳乡，众皆委羽而降。权使朱然、潘璋断其径路，即父子俱获，荆州遂定。</ref>
[[File:TRIBU TRES GARGANTAS-CHINA (35461639914).jpg|alt=|thumb|Three Gorges area]]
The incursion of northern nomadic peoples into the region at the beginning of the 4th century ([[Invasion and rebellion of the Five Barbarians|Five Barbarians' rebellion]] and [[Disaster of Yongjia]]
([[:zh:永嘉之乱|永嘉之乱]])) began nearly three centuries of division into a nomad-ruled (but increasingly Sinicized) north and a [[Han Chinese]]-ruled south. Hubei, to the south, remained under southern rule for this entire period, until the unification of China by the [[Sui dynasty]] in 589. In 617 the [[Tang dynasty]] replaced Sui, and later on the Tang dynasty placed present-day Hubei under the jurisdiction of several [[circuit (political division)|circuits]]: [[Jiangnanxi Circuit]] in the south; [[Shannandong Circuit]] (山南东道) in the west, and [[Huainan Circuit]] in the east. After the Tang dynasty disintegrated in the early 10th century, Hubei came under the control of several regional regimes: [[Jingnan]] in the center, [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Yang Wu]] and its successor [[Southern Tang]] to the east, the [[Five Dynasties]] to the north and Shu to Shizhou (施州, in modern [[Enshi City|Enshi]], [[Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.hubei.gov.cn/2018/local/2018gk/201810/t20181001_1348527_1.shtml|title= 湖北省情概况·历史沿革|date= 2019-04-24|access-date= 2021-07-27|website= HuBei China (HuBei Government's official website)|language= zh-hans|archive-date= 2022-10-23|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20221023155435/http://www.hubei.gov.cn/2018/local/2018gk/201810/t20181001_1348527_1.shtml|url-status= dead}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The [[Song dynasty]] reunified the region in 982 and placed most of Hubei into [[Jinghubei Circuit]], a longer version of Hubei's current name. [[Mongol]]s conquered the region in 1279, and under [[Yuan dynasty|their rule]] the province of [[Huguang]] was established, covering Hubei, Hunan, and parts of [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]].{{citation needed|date=May 2022}} During the Mongol rule, in 1331, Hubei was devastated by an outbreak of the [[Black Death]], which reached [[England]], [[Belgium]], and [[Italy]] by June 1348, and which, according to Chinese sources, spread during the following three centuries to decimate populations throughout Eurasia.<ref>{{Cite book

The [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644) drove out the Mongols in 1368. Their version of Huguang province was smaller, and corresponded almost entirely to the modern provinces of Hubei and Hunan combined. Hubei lay geographically outside the centers of the Ming power. During the last years of the Ming, today's Hubei was ravaged several times by the rebel armies of [[Zhang Xianzhong]] and [[Li Zicheng]]. The [[Manchu]] [[Qing dynasty]] which took control of much of the region in 1644, soon split Huguang into the modern provinces of Hubei and Hunan. The Qing dynasty, however, continued to maintain a [[Viceroy of Huguang]], one of the most well-known viceroys being [[Zhang Zhidong]] (in office between 1889 and 1907), whose modernizing reforms made Hubei (especially [[Wuhan]]) into a prosperous center of commerce and industry. The [[Huangshi]]/[[Daye, Hubei|Daye]] area, south-east of Wuhan, became an important center of mining and metallurgy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In 1911 the [[Wuchang Uprising]] took place in modern-day Wuhan. The uprising started the [[Xinhai Revolution]], which overthrew the Qing dynasty and established the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. In 1927 Wuhan became the seat of a government established by left-wing elements of the [[Kuomintang]], led by [[Wang Jingwei]]; this government later merged into [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s government in [[Nanjing]]. During [[World War II]] the eastern parts of Hubei were conquered and occupied by [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], while the western parts remained under Chinese control.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

During the [[Cultural Revolution]] in the 1960s, Wuhan saw fighting between rival [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guard]] factions. In July 1967, civil strife struck the city in the [[Wuhan Incident]] ("July 20th Incident"), an armed conflict between two hostile groups who were fighting for control over the city at the height of the Cultural Revolution.<ref>{{Cite journal | author= Thomas W.

The province—and Wuhan in particular—suffered severely from the [[1954 Yangtze River Floods]]. Large-scale dam construction followed, with the [[Gezhouba Dam]] on the [[Yangtze River]] near [[Yichang]] started in 1970 and completed in 1988; the construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]], further upstream, began in 1993. In the following years, authorities resettled millions of people from western Hubei to make way for the construction of the dam. A number of smaller dams have been constructed on the Yangtze's tributaries as well.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The [[Xianning Nuclear Power Plant]] is planned in Dafanzhen, Tongshan County, Xianning, to host at least four 1,250-megawatt (MW) AP1000 pressurized-water reactors.
Work on the site began in 2010; plans envisaged that the first reactor would start construction in 2011 and go online in 2015. However, construction of the first phase had yet to start {{as of | 2018 | lc = on}}.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}}

On 1 December 2019, the first case of [[COVID-19]] in the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] was identified in the city of [[Wuhan]]. In January 2020, the [[SARS-CoV-2]] virus was officially identified, leading local and federal governments to implement massive [[quarantine]] zones across Hubei province, especially in the capital [[Wuhan]] (the epicenter of the outbreak). Authorities partially or fully locked down 15 cities, directly affecting 57 million people. Following severe outbreaks in numerous other countries, including in different areas of the world, the [[World Health Organization's response to the COVID-19 pandemic|World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 a pandemic]] in March 2020. However, after more than eight weeks, the lockdown on most cities in the province was lifted.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}}

[[File:Danjiangkou, Shiyan, Hubei, China - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|[[Wudang Mountains]] in [[Danjiangkou]], Hubei]]
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}
The [[Jianghan Plain]] takes up most of central and southern Hubei, while the west and the peripheries are more [[mountain]]ous, with ranges such as the [[Wudang Mountains]], the [[Jing Mountains]], the [[Daba Mountains]], and the [[Wu Mountains]] (in rough north-to-south order). The [[Dabie Mountains]] lie to the northeast of the Jianghan Plain, on the border with [[Henan]] and [[Anhui]]; the Tongbai Mountains lie to the north on the border with [[Henan]]; to the southeast, the [[Mufu Mountains]] form the border with [[Jiangxi]]. The highest peak in Hubei is [[Shennong Peak]], found in the [[Daba Mountains]] of the [[forestry]] area of [[Shennongjia]]; it has an altitude of 3105 m.<ref>{{Cite web |last=UNEP-WCMC |date=2017-05-22 |title=Hubei Shennongjia |url=http://world-heritage-datasheets.unep-wcmc.org/datasheet/output/site/hubei-shennongjia |access-date=2024-01-25 |website=World Heritage Datasheet |language=en}}</ref>
[[File:Qing river.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|[[Qing River]] in [[Changyang Tujia Autonomous County]], southwestern Hubei]]
The two major rivers of Hubei are the [[Yangtze River]] and its left tributary, the [[Hanshui River|Han River]]; they lend their names to the [[Jianghan Plain]] – Jiang representing the Yangtze and han representing the Han River. The Yangtze River enters Hubei from the west via the [[Three Gorges]]; the eastern half of the [[Three Gorges]] ([[Xiling Gorge]] and part of [[Wu Gorge]]) lie in western Hubei, while the western half is in neighbouring [[Chongqing]]. The Han River enters the province from the northwest. After crossing most of the province, the two great rivers meet at the center of Wuhan, the provincial capital.

Among the notable tributaries of the Yangtze within the province are the [[Shen Nong Stream]] (a small northern tributary, severely affected by the Three Gorges Dam project); the [[Qing River|Qing]], a major waterway of southwestern Hubei; the [[Huangbo River|Huangbo]] near [[Yichang]]; and the [[Fushui River]] in the southeast.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Thousands of lakes dot the landscape of Hubei's Jianghan Plain, giving Hubei the name of "Province of Lakes"; the largest of these lakes are [[Liangzi Lake]] and [[Hong Lake]]. The numerous hydrodams have created a number of large reservoirs, the largest of which is the [[Danjiangkou Reservoir]] on the Han River, on the border between Hubei and [[Henan]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Hubei has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'' or ''Cwa'' under the [[Köppen climate classification]]), with four distinct seasons. Winters are cool to cold, with average temperatures of {{convert|1|to|6|°C|°F}} in January, while summers are hot and humid, with average temperatures of {{convert|24|to|30|°C|°F}} in July; punishing temperatures of {{convert|40|°C}} or above are widely associated with Wuhan, the provincial capital. The mountainous districts of western Hubei, in particular [[Shennongjia]], with their cooler summers, attract numerous visitors from Wuhan and other lowland cities.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Besides the capital [[Wuhan]], other important cities are [[Jingmen]]; [[Shiyan]], a center of automotive industry and the gateway to the [[Wudang Mountains]]; [[Yichang]], the main base for the gigantic hydroelectric projects of southwestern Hubei; and [[Shashi District|Shashi]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Administrative divisions==

People in Hubei speak [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] dialects; most of these dialects are classified as [[Southwestern Mandarin]] dialects, a group that also encompasses the Mandarin dialects of most of southwestern China.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Perhaps the most celebrated element of [[Hubei cuisine]] is the [[Wuchang bream]], a freshwater [[bream]] that is commonly steamed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Types of traditional [[Chinese opera]] popular in Hubei include [[Han opera|Hanju]] and [[Chuju (Chinese opera)|Chuju]] ({{zh|c=楚剧 |p=Chǔ Jù |labels=no}}).

The [[Shennongjia]] area is the alleged home of the ''[[Yeren]]'', a wild undiscovered [[Hominidae|hominid]] that lives in the forested hills.

The people of Hubei are given the uncomplimentary nickname "[[Nine-headed Bird]]s" by other Chinese, from a [[Chinese mythology|mythological]] creature said to be very aggressive and hard to kill. ''"In the sky live nine-headed birds. On the earth live Hubei people."'' ({{zh|s=天上九头鸟，地上湖北佬<!--|t=天上九頭鳥，地上湖北佬-->|p=Tiānshàng jiǔ tóu niǎo, dìshàng Húběi lǎo |labels=no}})

== Transportation ==
[[Image:Wuhan-boat-0157.jpg|thumb|Boats on the [[Yangtze River]] in [[Wuhan]]]]
Prior to the construction of China's national railway network, the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] and [[Hanshui]] Rivers had been the main transportation arteries of Hubei for many centuries, and still continue to play an important transport role.

Historically, Hubei's overland transport network was hampered by the lack of bridges across the [[Yangtze River]], which divides the province into northern and southern regions. The first bridge across the Yangtze in Hubei, the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]] was completed in 1957, followed by the Zhicheng Bridge in 1971. {{As of|2014|October}}, Hubei had [[Yangtze River bridges and tunnels|23 bridges and tunnels]] across the Yangtze River, including nine bridges and three tunnels in Wuhan.

===Rail===
The [[Jingguang railway|railway from Beijing]] reached Wuhan in 1905, and was later extended to Guangzhou, becoming the first north-to-south railway mainline to cross China. A number of other lines crossed the province later on, including the [[Jiaozuo–Liuzhou railway]] and [[Beijing–Kowloon railway]], respectively, in the western and eastern part of the province.

The first decade of the 21st century has seen a large amount of new railway construction in Hubei. The [[Wuhan–Guangzhou high-speed railway]], roughly parallel to the original Wuhan-Guangzhou line, opened in late 2009, it was subsequently extended to the north, to Beijing becoming the [[Beijing–Guangzhou high-speed railway]]. An east-west high-speed corridor connecting major cities along the Yangtze, the [[Shanghai–Wuhan–Chengdu passenger railway]] was gradually opened between 2008 and 2012, the [[Wuhan–Yichang railway]] section of it opening in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:汉宜高铁拟本月开通 届时每日将开行20对列车 |url=http://roll.sohu.com/20120510/n342830481.shtml|language=zh |date=10 May 2012}}</ref> The [[Wuhan–Xiaogan intercity railway]] was opened in December 2016 and it was extended when the [[Wuhan–Shiyan high-speed railway]] opened in November 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hb.chinanews.com/news/2016/1201/266267.html |script-title=zh:武孝城际铁路正式开通 市民可以坐城铁赶飞机 |trans-title=Wuhan&ndash;Xiaogan intercity railway officially opens; city residents can take the line to catch flights |language=zh |website=chinanews.com Hubei |date=2016-12-01 |access-date=2019-12-19 |archive-date=2017-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109191244/http://www.hb.chinanews.com/news/2016/1201/266267.html |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=IRG>{{cite web |title=Wuhan – Shiyan high speed line opens |url=https://www.railwaygazette.com/high-speed/wuhan-shiyan-high-speed-line-opens/55242.article |website=Railway Gazette International |access-date=1 December 2019 |date=29 November 2019}}</ref>

===Air===
Hubei's main airport is [[Wuhan Tianhe International Airport]]. [[Yichang Sanxia Airport]] serves the Three Gorges region. There are also passenger airports [[Xiangyang Airport|in Xiangyang]], [[Enshi Airport|Enshi]], and [[Jingzhou]] ([[Shashi Airport]], named after the city's [[Shashi District]]).

== Tourism ==
The province's best-known natural attraction (shared with the adjacent [[Chongqing]] municipality) is the scenic area of the [[Three Gorges]] of the Yangtze. Located in the far west of the province, the gorges can be conveniently visited by one of the numerous tourist boats (or regular passenger boats) that travel up the Yangtze from [[Yichang]] through the [[Three Gorges]] and into the neighboring [[Chongqing]] municipality.

The [[Daba Mountains|mountains of western Hubei]], in particular in [[Shennongjia]] District, offer a welcome respite from Wuhan's and Yichang's summer heat, as well as skiing opportunities in winter. The tourist facilities in that area concentrate around [[Muyu, Hubei|Muyu]] in the southern part of [[Shennongjia]], the gateway to Shennongjia National Nature Reserve ({{lang|zh-hans|神农架国家自然保护区}}). Closer to the provincial capital, Wuhan, is the [[Mount Jiugong]] (''Jiugongshan'') national park, in [[Tongshan County, Hubei|Tongshan County]] near the border with [[Jiangxi]].

A particular important site of both natural and cultural significance is [[Mount Wudang]] (''Wudangshan'') in the northwest of the province. Originally created early in the [[Ming dynasty]], its building complex has been listed by [[UNESCO]] since 1994 as a [[World Heritage Site]].

Other historic attractions in Hubei include:
*The old [[Jingzhou]] City

*The Xianling Mausoleum, built by the [[Ming dynasty]] [[Jiajing Emperor]] for his parents at their [[fief]] near [[Zhongxiang]]<ref>Eric N. Danielson, "[http://www.chinaheritagenewsletter.org/articles.php?searchterm=016_mingancestor.inc&issue=016 The Ming Ancestor Tomb] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230125814/http://www.chinaheritagenewsletter.org/articles.php?searchterm=016_mingancestor.inc&issue=016 |date=2014-12-30 }}"</ref>
*The [[Yellow Crane Tower]] in [[Wuhan]]
*The [[Hubei Provincial Museum]] in Wuhan, with extensive archaeological and cultural exhibits and performance presentations of ancient music and dance. This is one of the best places to learn about the ancient [[state of Chu]], which flourished in the territory of present-day Hubei during the [[Eastern Zhou dynasty]] and developed its own unique culture, quite distinct from that of the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]]/[[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] civilization of northern China.

The province also has historical sites connected with China's more recent history, such as the [[Wuchang Uprising]] Memorial in Wuhan, [[Underground Project 131|Project 131]] site (a Cultural-Revolution-era underground military command center) in [[Xianning]], and the National Mining Park ({{lang|zh-Hans|国家矿山公园}}) in [[Huangshi]].<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2008-09/22/content_7046446.htm "Mining for tourism in Hubei"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011211155/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2008-09/22/content_7046446.htm |date=2008-10-11 }}, By Li Jing (China Daily).

== Sister State/Twinning ==
Following a July 1979 State of Ohio Trade Mission to China, Hubei and Ohio formed a sister province-state relationship.<ref name=":05">{{Cite book |last=Lampton |first=David M. |title=Living U.S.-China relations: From Cold War to Cold War |date=2024 |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]] |isbn=978-1-5381-8725-8 |location=Lanham, MD |pages= |author-link=David M. Lampton}}</ref>{{Rp|pages=111–113}} The pairing was based on the fact that both Hubei and Ohio are located in national heartlands, are large industrial areas and transportation hubs, and have significant agricultural sectors.<ref name=":05" />{{Rp|page=113}}

In 2005, Hubei province signed a twinning agreement with [[Telemark]] county of Norway, and a "Norway-Hubei Week" was held in 2007.
