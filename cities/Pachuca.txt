'''Pachuca''' ({{IPA|es|paˈtʃuka|-|Pachuca.ogg}}; {{lang-ote|Nju̱nthe}}), formally known as '''Pachuca de Soto''', is the capital and largest city of the east-central [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[States of Mexico|state]] of [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], located in the south-central part of the state. [[Pachuca Municipality|Pachuca de Soto]] is also the name of the municipality for which the city serves as municipal seat. Pachuca is located about {{convert|90|km}} north of [[Mexico City]] via [[Mexican Federal Highway 85]].<ref name="tips">{{cite web |first=Antonio |last=Aldama |title=Tips viajero Pachuca (Hidalgo) |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/5029-Tips-viajero-Pachuca-%28Hidalgo%29 |publisher=Mexico Desconocido |location=Mexico City |language=es |trans-title=Travelers tips Pachuca (Hidalgo) |access-date=2009-10-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416140420/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/5029-Tips-viajero-Pachuca-(Hidalgo) |archive-date=2009-04-16 }}</ref> 

There is no agreed upon consensus regarding the origins of the word ''pachuca''. It has been loosely traced to ''pachoa'' ('strait', 'opening'), ''pachoacan'' ('place of government', 'place of silver and gold') and ''patlachuican'' ('place of factories', 'place of tears').<ref name="encmuc">{{cite web |title=Estado de Hidalgo Pachuca de Soto |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_hidalgo |publisher=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México |language=es |access-date=2009-10-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517164754/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_hidalgo |archive-date=2011-05-17 }}</ref>

Pachuca remained a major mining center until the mid-20th century, with the city's fortunes fluctuating with the health of the mining sector. In the mid-20th century, a major downturn in mining pushed the city to shift focus from mining to industry, resulting in the revamping of the [[Universidad Autónoma de Hidalgo]]. Today, mining forms only a fraction of the municipality's economy.<ref name="encmuc" /><ref name="fundacion">{{cite web |title= Fundación, historia y desarrollo de Pachuca |url=http://www.elclima.com.mx/fundacion_historia_y_desarrollo_de_pachuca.htm |publisher=El Clima |location=Mexico City |language=es |trans-title=The founding, history and development of Pachuca |access-date=2009-10-08}}</ref> One cultural aspect that makes Pachuca unique is the influence of the [[Cornish people|Cornish]] miners who immigrated in the 19th century from [[Great Britain]], as many of their descendants remain in Pachuca, and nearby [[Real del Monte]].

==History==
[[File:Reloj Monumental, Pachuca, Hidalgo, México, 2013-10-10, DD 07.JPG|thumbnail|150px|left|Closeup of the Reloj Monumental]]
Evidence of early human habitation in this area is found in Cerro de las Navajas and Zacualtipán, in the Sierra de Pachuca. Here primitive mines to extract green obsidian, arrow heads, scraping tools, and [[mammoth]] remains can be traced back as far as 12,000 BCE. An ancient pre-Hispanic obsidian tool-making center has also been found in the small town of San Bartolo near the city. Around 2,000 BCE nomadic groups here began to be replaced by sedentary peoples who formed farming villages in an area then known as Itzcuincuitlapilco, of which the municipality of Pachuca is a part. Later artifacts from between 200 CE and 850 CE show [[Teotihuacan]] influence with platforms and figurines found in San Bartolo and in Tlapacoya. Development of this area as a city, however, would lag behind other places in the region such as [[Tulancingo]], [[Tula, Hidalgo|Tula]] and [[Atotonilco El Grande]],<ref name="encmuc" /> but the archeological sites here were on the trade routes among these larger cities.<ref name="fundacion" />

After the Teotihuacan era, the area was dominated by the [[Chichimecas]] with their capital in [[Xaltocan]], who called the area around Pachuca Njunthé. Later, the Chichimecas would found the dominion of Cuauhtitlán pushing the native [[Otomi people|Otomis]] to the [[Mezquital Valley]]. These conquests coalesced into a zone called Cuautlalpan, of which Pachuca was a part. Fortifications in the area of Pachuca city and other areas were built between 1174 and 1181.<ref name="encmuc" /><ref name="fundacion" />
This dominion would eventually be overrun by the [[Aztec Triple Alliance]] between 1427 and 1430, with rule in Pachuca then coming from the city of [[Tenochtitlan]]. According to tradition, it was after this conquest that mineral exploitation began here and in neighboring Real del Monte, at a site known as Jacal or San Nicolás.<ref name="encmuc" /> The Aztec governing center was where Plaza Juárez in Pachuca city is now.<ref name="donde" />

The Spanish arrived here in 1528, killing the local Aztec governor, Ixcóatl.<ref name="donde" /> Credit for the Spanish conquest of the Pachuca area has been given [[Francisco Téllez]], an artilleryman who came to Mexico with [[Hernán Cortés]] in 1519.<ref name="encmuc" /> He and Gonzalo Rodriguez were the first Spaniards here, constructing two feudal estates, and calling the area Real de Minas de Pachuca.<ref name="donde" /> Téllez was also given credit for laying out the colonial city of Pachuca on the European model but this story has been proven false, with no alternative version.<ref name="encmuc" /> Mining resources were not discovered here until 1552,<ref name="Bakewell">{{cite book|author=West, Robert |chapter=Early Silver Mining in New Spain, 1531–1555 |editor1-last=Bakewell|editor1-first=Peter|title=Mines of Silver and Gold in the Americas|date=1997|publisher=Variorum, Ashgate Publishing Limited|location=Aldershot|pages=58}}</ref> and there are several versions of this story. The most probable comes from a work called "Descripción Anónima de la Minas de Pachuca" (Anonymous Description of the Mines of Pachuca) written between the end of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th. This work claims that the first mineral deposits were found by Alonso Rodríguez de Salgado on his ranch on the outskirts of Pachuca in two large hills called Magdalena and Cristóbal.<ref name="encmuc" /> This discovery would quickly change the area's economy from agriculture to one dependent almost completely on mining.<ref name="fundacion" />

As early as 1560 the population of the city had tripled to 2,200, with most people employed in mining in some way. Because of this rapid growth and the ruggedness of the terrain, it was impossible to lay out an orderly set of streets. The first main plaza was placed next to the Asunción Parish, which is now the Garden of the Constitution. Next to the {{lang|es|Cajas Reales}} (Royal Safe) was constructed to guard the fifth that belonged to the king.<ref name="encmuc" />
[[File:Cajasreales.jpg|thumb|left|The Cajas Reales, built to guard the fifth of miners' finds that belonged to the king]]
In 1554, on the {{lang|es|Purísima Concepción Hacienda}}, now the site of a tennis club, [[Bartolome de Medina (mining specialist)|Bartolomé de Medina]] found the largest mineral deposits here as well as developed new ways of extracting minerals from ore using the [[patio process]]. This caused Pachuca to grow even more with the discovery of new deposits and accelerated extraction processes. Mining operations spread to nearby areas such as [[Atotonilco de Tula|Atotonilco]], [[Actopan, Hidalgo|Actopan]], and [[Tizayuca]]. The population of the town continued to grow, leading Pachuca to be declared a city in 1813.<ref name="encmuc" /><ref name=Edith>{{cite book|last1=Couturier|first1=Edith|title=The Silver King|date=2003|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|isbn=0-8263-2874-1|page=47,55}}</ref>

Mining output had waned by the 18th century due to flooding, but was revived in 1741 by the first Count of Regla, [[Pedro Romero de Terreros]], and his business partner Jose Alejandro Bustamante, who invested in new drainage works.<ref name=Edith /> He also discovered new veins of ore, mostly in nearby [[Mineral del Monte|Real del Monte]].<ref name="fundacion" />  By 1746, Pachuca had a population of 900 Spanish, [[mestizo]], and [[mulatto]] households, plus 120 [[indigenous peoples of Mexico|Indian]] ones.<ref name=Edith />

During the [[Mexican War of Independence]], the city was taken by Miguel Serrano and Vicente Beristain de Souza in 1812, which caused the mines here to be abandoned by owners loyal to Spain.<ref name="fundacion" /> The war left the Pachuca area in a state of chaos, both politically and economically. The third Count of Regla brought the first [[Cornish people|Cornish miners]] and technology around 1824.<ref name="encmuc" /> The Cornish took over mines abandoned by the Spanish, bringing 1,500 tonnes of more modern equipment from [[Cornwall]].<ref name="lauer">{{cite web |first=David |last=Lauer |title=El Museo de Minería de Pachuca.

[[File:ACCIONES MINERASHGO.jpg|thumb|Stock certificates in mining companies of Pachuca in the Museo de Minería]]

Mining operations were disrupted again by the [[Mexican Revolution]] in the early 20th century. The city was first taken by forces loyal to [[Francisco I. Madero]] in 1911. Roberto Martinez y Martinez, a general under [[Pancho Villa]], entered the city in 1915. Both incursions were due to the economic importance of the mines here.<ref name="fundacion" /> During this time American investors came to Pachuca, again updating the mining technology used here. From 1906 to 1947 the United States Smelting, Refining and Mining Company was the primary producer here, with output reaching its peak in the 1930s. However, by 1947, mining here had become too costly, because of political instability, labor disputes and low prices for silver on the world market. The company sold its interests to the Mexican government in 1965.<ref name="encmuc" /><ref name="lauer" />

The decline in mining here in the mid-20th century had disastrous effects on the city. Many of the abandoned houses and other buildings were in danger of collapse. Under ownership of the Mexican government, mining came to a near standstill. During this time Pachuca's economy began to shift from mining to industry. The old Instituto Científico Literario Autónomo de Hidalgo was converted to the Universidad Autónoma del Estado in 1961, which would become one of the impetuses to the growth of the city in the following years, turning out as it did a better-educated and more technical workforce in areas such as law, engineering, business and medicine. In the late 1950s and through the 1960s, some growth was seen in the way of suburban developments for workers in newly built factories.<ref name="encmuc" />

Population growth returned in the 1970s and continued through the 1990s because of the growth of non-mining industries as well as a development of a large student population for the state university as well as other educational institutions. Another impetus was the movement of many government offices to Pachuca with new government facilities such as the State Government Palace and the State Supreme Court built in the 1970s. Much of the city's growth during this time was due to new housing projects, but infrastructure projects such as the new Municipal Market, the remodeling of the Plaza [[Benito Juárez]] and the main bus station also took place.<ref name="encmuc" />

;Reloj Monumental
The [[Monumental Clock of Pachuca]] is the icon of the city. Donated by [[Cornish people|Cornishman]], [[Francis Rule]],<ref name="Cornish-mexico.org" /> it was built to commemorate the Centennial of [[Mexican independence|Mexico's Independence]], and was inaugurated on 15 September 1910 (Noche de Grito).<ref name="encmuc" /> The base of the Reloj was made originally for a [[kiosk]] but it was decided to put the clock here instead.<ref name="Lopez" /> A group from the city had the idea for the clock, and they, along with Mexican ambassador Jesús Zenil arranged to have the same company that built [[Big Ben]], construct the inner workings. The outer monument portion is Mexican-made and was supervised by engineers Francisco Hernández and Luis Carreón. It is a tower with four parts in [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassic style]], constructed of white "cantera" stone with a height of 40 meters. In the middle there are four sculpted faces of women done in marble by Carrara, which symbolise the Reform, Liberty, Independence and Constitution.<ref name="encmuc" />

===Education===
[[File:Pachuca Centro (19).JPG|right|thumb|[[Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Hidalgo]] Central Building]]

The [[Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Hidalgo]] was constructed over the old Hospital de San Juan de Dios.<ref name="tips" /> It is the oldest educational institution in Hidalgo, brought into being at the same time as the state. The school was originally established as the Instituto Literario y Escuela de Artes y Oficios (Literary Institute and School of Arts and Letters) in 1869. The school was initially in a rented house but was moved to the former Hospital of San Juan de Dios in 1875. This building is now the Central Building. The school was based on positivist philosophy and the University motto of "Amor, orden y progreso" ("love, order and progress") remains to this day. The school was renamed the Universidad de Hidalgo in 1925 and again to the Universidad Autónoma de Hidalgo in 1948. The university was reorganized and expanded in 1961.<ref name="sketch">{{cite web |title=A Brief Historical Sketch of the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Hidalgo (UAEH) |url=http://www.uaeh.edu.mx/en/universidad/index_en.html |publisher=UAEH |location=Pachuca |access-date=2009-10-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312065645/http://www.uaeh.edu.mx/en/universidad/index_en.html |archive-date=2011-03-12 }}</ref>

A more recently established school opened in 2003 is the Universidad Politécnica de Pachuca (Polytechnic University of Pachuca), which is mostly an engineering school. It was temporarily housed in the old Universidad Pedagógica Nacional buildings, but in 2004 the state of Hidalgo ceded the university the old Santa Barbara Hacienda, with 231 students studying classes in [[Mechatronics]], [[Information technology]] and [[Biotechnology]] at the new facility.

===History===
[[File:HousePachuca.JPG|thumb|Old English-style house, in historic central Pachuca]]
[[File:RelojPachucaAtardecer.jpg|thumb|Historic center of Pachuca at dusk, with Monumental Clock]]

Beginning in 1824, Cornish miners and English investors came to Pachuca and the neighboring town of Real del Monte to invest and work in the mines here. Some founded the Compañía Real de Monte y Pachuca.<ref name="pizano" /><ref name="seijas">{{cite web |last= Seijas |first= Susana |title= Hidalgo's British bounty Inside Mexico |url= http://www.insidemex.com/travel/travel/hidalgos-british-bounty |access-date= 2009-10-08 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090427113327/http://insidemex.com/travel/travel/hidalgos-british-bounty |archive-date= 2009-04-27 }}</ref> Mexico's remaining Cornish community represents a largely forgotten immigrant story. In the early 19th century, miners in Cornwall were enduring economic hardships. Ships carrying 125 passengers and some 1,500 tons of equipment sailed out of [[Falmouth, Cornwall]], landing in [[Veracruz]] three months later. The treacherous 500-kilometre (300&nbsp;mi) trek inland killed about half of the miners and their family members, many succumbing to [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]]. Those who made it settled in Pachuca and Real del Monte.

The immigrants brought technology, notably the famous high-pressure steam pumping engines designed by Cornish engineer [[Richard Trevithick]], which turned many of the area's water-logged mines into huge silver producers.<ref name="seijas" /> The majority of the immigrants to this region came from Cornish mining areas of [[Camborne]], [[Redruth]] and [[Gwennap]].<ref name="western">{{cite news |title=Mexicans say 'muchas gracias' for pasties, silver and football |url=http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Mexicans-say-muchas-gracias-pasties-silver-football/story-11652641-detail/story.html |newspaper=Western Morning News |date=2008-11-26 |access-date=2015-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220174646/http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Mexicans-say-muchas-gracias-pasties-silver-football/story-11652641-detail/story.html |archive-date=2014-02-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Cornish/English workers and their technology revitalized the silver industry here and miners' remittances sent back home helped to build the Wesleyan Chapel in Redruth in the 1820s.

;Architecture
Today the Pachuca – Real del Monte District retains much from its period of association with Cornwall and home of one of Mexico's most enduring cross cultural pollinations.<ref name="cornish" /><ref name="seijas" /> The miners' influence is obvious in architecture. Up in the hills around Pachuca, many houses feature distinctly British characteristics: thicker walls, square windows and pitched roofs.<ref name="seijas" /> Some of Pachuca's landmarks have English/Cornish influences. The Spanish Baroque style Reloj Monumental (Monumental Clock) chimes to the tune of Big Ben, and was financed by Francis Rule. The city's main Methodist church was built by Cornish miners. The English mining company's main office as well as the residence of Francis Rule of Camborne, the last Cornish manager of the Real del Monte mine, still bears his initials. The archives of the company are part of the "Historic Archive and Museum of Mining in Pachuca" (''Museo de Minería'') collections, and contain detailed records of Cornish employees, especially between 1824 and 1849.<ref name="cornish" />

===Influences===
The Cornish immigrants married into Mexican families, and even today Cornish surnames are not uncommon in this area with hundreds of Cornish descendants present. One example is Umberto Skewes, who speaks little English but whose grandfather came to Mexico from Cornwall. Skewes is custodian of the English Cemetery, which contains approximately 600 graves, predominantly of Cornish miners and their families.<ref name="cornish" /><ref name="seijas" /> The Cornish-Mexican Cultural Society works to build educational links between Mexico and the United Kingdom.<ref name="seijas" /> The group has marketed Pachuca and Real del Monte as "Mexico's Little Cornwall" through the Mexican embassy in [[London]].<ref name="diaspora">{{cite web |title= The Cornish Diaspora |url=http://www.cornwalls.co.uk/history/industrial/diaspora.htm |publisher= Cornwall Guide |access-date=2009-10-08 }}</ref>

====Football====
In 1900 Cornish miners established the [[C.F. Pachuca|Pachuca Athletic Club]], which was primarily dedicated to football. Their first game was played in the same year, a fact that is celebrated annually. The first team from Pachuca consisted of Charles Dawe, John Dawe, James Bennetts, John Bennetts, William Blamey, Richard Sobey, William Bragg, William Thomas, Percy Bunt, Lionel Bunt, Albert Pengelly and William Pengelly. The Pachuca club encouraged the formation of teams in Mexico City and [[Orizaba, Veracruz|Orizaba]], the first championship of the new [[Mexican Football Federation|Liga Mexicana de Fútbol Asociación]] was played in 1902. Other clubs, such as the Reform Athletic Club, El British Club, F. C. and El México Cricket Club were also formed by miners. The first Mexican player appears in the ranks of the Pachuca club in 1908 and by 1915, most of the team was Mexican. Pachuca won the Copa Tower in 1908 and 1912, the precedent of the modern [[Copa México|Mexican Cup]]. The team disbanded in the 1920s but was re-instituted in 1951.<ref name="cornish" /><ref name="tuzos">{{cite web |title=Website de Pachuca Club de Futbol. |url=http://tuzos.vientosdepachuca.com/his.htm |publisher=Pachuca Club de Futbol |location=Pachuca |language=es |trans-title=Pachuca Soccer Club Website |access-date=2009-10-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528091305/http://tuzos.vientosdepachuca.com/his.htm |archive-date=2009-05-28 }}</ref>  Pachuca calls itself the "Cradle of Mexican Football."<ref name="marin">{{cite news |title=Una Visita a Pachuca, Hidalgo |first=Wendy |last=Marín |url=http://sdpnoticias.com/sdp/columna/wendy-marin/2009/01/07/304090 |newspaper=SDP Noticias |location=Mexico City |date=2009-01-07 |access-date=2009-10-08 |language=es |trans-title=A Visit to Pachuca, Hidalgo |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716024503/http://sdpnoticias.com/sdp/columna/wendy-marin/2009/01/07/304090 |archive-date=2011-07-16 }}</ref>

====Pastes====
{{Main|Paste (pasty)}}
[[File:BakedPastes.JPG|thumb|''[[Paste (pasty)|Pastes]]'' for sale]]

The Mexican Spanish word "[[Paste (pasty)|paste]]" (pronounced PAH-steh) come from the Cornish word pasties, which is basically a semi-circular turnover made with a pastry crust with sweet or savory fillings. Cornish miners brought the recipe with them as they made a good way to bring their midday meal with them to the mines. One feature of both pasties and pastes is that they have a thick braided edge. Originally, this was done to provide the miners a way to hold the turnover without getting the filled portion dirty, as there was no way to wash their hands before eating. The shape and pastry portion of the turnover have remained the same but today, the fillings are decidedly Mexican: [[mole (sauce)|mole]] verde, beans, mole rojo, chicken "tinga," pineapple, rice pudding and one seasonal specialty is a lamb paste with [[poblano]] chili peppers. Pastes are a local delicacy strongly identified with both Pachuca and Real del Monte.<ref name="cornish" /><ref name="cuisine">{{cite web |first= Karen |last=Hursh Graber |title= The Cuisine of Hidalgo: Spanning Climates and Cultures  |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2416-the-cuisine-of-hidalgo-spanning-climates-and-cultures |publisher= Mexconnect |access-date=2009-10-08 }}</ref>

==Festivals==

The Feria de Pachuca is known colloquially by several names such as the Feria Tradicional/Internacional de San Francisco, the Feria de Hidalgo and the Feria de Caballo. It is the most important annual event in the state of Hidalgo, taking place every October in facilities located in the south of Pachuca. The festival began as a liturgical event sponsored by monks at the monastery of San Francisco in the 16th century, which eventually drew dignitaries from surrounding communities. The festival sponsors a number of events such as [[bullfight]]s, [[cockfight]]s, [[charreada]]s, horse shows, rodeos, crafts and folk dance shows, livestock exhibitions and features regional cuisine. It also host concerts by well-known Mexican musical artists.<ref name="encmuc" /><ref name="cuisine" /><ref name="fiestas">{{cite web  |title= Fiestas populares en Pachuca, Hidalgo |url=http://www.elclima.com.mx/fiestas_populares_en_pachuca_hidalgo.htm |publisher=El Clima |location=Mexico City |language=es |trans-title=Popular festivals in Pachuca, Hidalgo |access-date=2009-10-08 }}</ref>

==Economy==
Despite its decline in the 20th century, mining still continues to be an important element of Pachuca's economy. Pachuca still produces more than 60% of the state's gold and more than 50% of its silver. The [[Mexican Geological Survey]] is headquartered in the city.

The manufacturing sector was established in the 1950s and has been steadily growing, changing the city's traditional mining image. Some of the major industrial employers are Applied Power de México (automotive parts), BARROMEX (machinery), Herramientas Cleveland (machinery and tools) and Embotelladora la Minera (soft drinks). The city also contains over 800 smaller manufacturing enterprises.

The municipality's economy also has a large commercial sector, with numerous stores and thirteen public markets. It is also the wholesale center for foodstuffs for most of the state.

Despite all the changes in the 20th century, the center of Pachuca has maintained its provincial feel. This has led the city to promote it as a tourist attraction.<ref name="encmuc" /><ref name="fundacion" />

==Pachuca Municipality==

The Pachuca Municipality is increasingly co-extensive with the city, as the city's metro area development grows to cover over 60% of the available open space. The municipality contains fifteen other communities, with all but two having less than 1500 people according to the 2005 INEGI census. Only three percent of the municipality population of 275,578 lives outside the city boundaries.<ref name="inegi">{{cite web |title= Principales resultados por localidad 2005 (ITER) |url= http://www.inegi.org.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/default.asp?s=est&c=10395 |publisher= INEGI |access-date= 2009-10-08 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110722200612/http://www.inegi.org.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/default.asp?s=est&c=10395 |archive-date= 2011-07-22 }}</ref>
