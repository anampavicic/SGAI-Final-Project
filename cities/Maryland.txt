Maryland's early settlements and population centers clustered around waterways that empty into the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Its economy was heavily [[Plantation economy|plantation-based]] and centered mostly on the cultivation of [[tobacco]]. Demand for cheap labor from Maryland colonists led to the importation of numerous [[Indentured servitude in British America|indentured servants]] and [[History of slavery in Maryland|enslaved Africans]]. In 1760, Maryland's current boundaries took form following the [[Mason–Dixon line|settlement]] of a long-running border dispute with Pennsylvania. Many of its citizens played [[Maryland in the American Revolution|key political and military roles]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Although it was a [[Slave states and free states|slave state]], Maryland [[Border states (American Civil War)|remained in the Union]] during the [[American Civil War]], and its proximity to Washington D.C. and Virginia made it [[Maryland in the American Civil War|a significant strategic location]]. After the Civil War ended, Maryland took part in the [[Industrial Revolution in the United States|Industrial Revolution]], driven by its seaports, railroad networks, and mass immigration from Europe.

Since the 1940s, the state's population has grown rapidly, to approximately six million residents, and it is among the most densely populated U.S. states. {{as of|2015}}, Maryland had the [[List of U.S. states by income|highest median household income]] of any state, owing in large part to its proximity to Washington, D.C., and a highly diversified economy spanning manufacturing, retail services, public administration,  real estate, higher education, information technology, defense contracting, health care, and biotechnology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://proximityone.com/stmhi0910.htm|title=State Median Household Income Patterns: 1990–2010|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=August 6, 2012|archive-date=October 26, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026201715/http://proximityone.com/stmhi0910.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> Maryland is one of the most multicultural states in the country; it is one of the six states where [[Majority minority in the United States|non-Whites compose a majority of the population]], with the fifth-highest percentage of [[African Americans]], and high numbers of residents born in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Central America]], and the [[Caribbean]].

What is now Maryland was originally inhabited by tribes such as the [[Piscataway people|Piscataway]] (including the [[Patuxent people|Patuxent]]), the [[Nanticoke people|Nanticoke]] (including the [[Tockwogh|Tocwogh]], the [[Ozinie]] and other subdivisions), the [[Powhatan]], the [[Lenape]], the [[Susquehannock]], the [[Shawnee]], the [[Tutelo]], the [[Saponi]], the [[Pocomoke people|Pocomoke]] and the [[Massawomeck people|Massawomeck]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Maryland Indian Tribes and Languages |url=https://www.native-languages.org/maryland.htm |access-date=2024-09-03 |website=www.native-languages.org}}</ref>{{Self-published inline|date=September 2024}} [[George Calvert, 1st Lord Baltimore|George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore]] (1579–1632), sought a charter from King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] for the territory between [[Massachusetts]] to the north and [[Virginia]] to the immediate south.<ref name="Stewart 1967 42–43">{{Cite book|last=Stewart

After Baltimore died in April 1632, the charter was granted to his son, [[Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore]] (1605–1675), on June 20, 1632. Officially, the new "Maryland Colony" was named in honor of [[Henrietta Maria of France]], wife of Charles I.{{sfn|Marsh|2011|p=5}} Lord Baltimore initially proposed the name "Crescentia", the land of growth or increase, but "the King proposed Terra Mariae [Mary Land], which was concluded on and inserted in the bill."<ref name=":1" />

The original capital of Maryland was [[St. Mary's City, Maryland|St. Mary's City]], on the north shore of the [[Potomac River]], and the county surrounding it, the first erected/created in the province,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/speccol/photos/lowe/html/sm_2.html|title=Maryland In Focus—St. Mary's County|first=Kristin P.|last=Masser|website=Maryland State Archives|access-date=September 6, 2017|archive-date=October 10, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010135440/http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/speccol/photos/lowe/html/sm_2.html|url-status=live}}</ref> was first called Augusta Carolina, after the King, and later named St. Mary's County.<ref>''History of Maryland'', p. 32</ref>

Lord Baltimore's first settlers arrived in the new colony in March 1634, with his younger brother the Honorable [[Leonard Calvert]] (1606–1647), as first provincial [[Governor of Maryland]]. They made their first permanent settlement at [[St. Mary's City, Maryland|St. Mary's City]] in what is now [[St. Mary's County, Maryland|St. Mary's County]]. They purchased the site from the [[paramount chief]] of the region, who was eager to establish trade. St. Mary's became the first [[state capital|capital]] of Maryland, and remained so for 60 years until 1695. More settlers soon followed. Their tobacco crops were successful and quickly made the new colony profitable. However, given the incidence of [[malaria]], [[yellow fever]], and [[typhoid]], life expectancy in Maryland was about 10 years less than in [[New England]].<ref name=iha>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushistory.org/us/5a.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322155310/http://www.ushistory.org/us/5a.asp|url-status=dead|title=Maryland—The Catholic Experiment |archive-date=March 22, 2016|website=www.ushistory.org}}</ref>

In 1642, a number of [[Puritans]] left [[Virginia]] for Maryland and founded the city of Providence, now called [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], on the western shore of the upper [[Chesapeake Bay]].<ref>Taylor, Owen M., ''History of Annapolis'' (1872) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vr9ib-I1WlIC p. 5]</ref> A dispute with traders from Virginia over [[Kent Island]] in the Chesapeake led to armed conflict. In 1644, [[William Claiborne]], a Puritan, seized Kent Island while his associate, the [[Roundheads|pro-Parliament]] Puritan [[Richard Ingle]], took over St. Mary's.<ref>Brenner, Robert. ''Merchants and Revolution'' London:Verso. 2003, {{ISBN|1-85984-333-6}}</ref> Both used religion as a tool to gain popular support. The two years from 1644 to 1646 when Claiborne and his Puritan associates held sway were known as "The Plundering Time". They captured Jesuit priests, imprisoned them, then sent them back to England.

In 1646, [[Leonard Calvert]] returned with troops, recaptured St. Mary's City, and restored order. The House of Delegates passed the "Act concerning Religion" in 1649 granting religious liberty to all [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] Christians.<ref name=iha/>

In 1650, the Puritans revolted against the proprietary government. "Protestants swept the Catholics out of the legislature{{spaces}}... and religious strife returned."<ref name=iha/> The Puritans set up a new government prohibiting both [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Church of England|Anglicanism]]. The Puritan revolutionary government persecuted Maryland Catholics during its reign, known as the "plundering time". Mobs burned down all the original Catholic churches of southern Maryland. The Puritan rule lasted until 1658 when the Calvert family and Lord Baltimore regained proprietary control and re-enacted the Toleration Act.

After England's [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688, Maryland outlawed Catholicism. In 1704, the Maryland General Assembly prohibited Catholics from operating schools, limited the corporate ownership of property to hamper religious orders from expanding or supporting themselves, and encouraged the conversion of Catholic children.<ref name=":0" /> The celebration of the Catholic sacraments was also officially restricted. This state of affairs lasted until after the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783). Wealthy Catholic planters built chapels on their land to practice their religion in relative secrecy.

Into the 18th century, individual priests and lay leaders claimed Maryland farms belonging to the Jesuits as personal property and [[bequest|bequeathed]] them in order to evade the legal restrictions on religious organizations' owning property.<ref name=":0" />

===Border disputes (1681–1760)===

The royal charter granted Maryland the land north of the [[Potomac River]] up to the [[40th parallel north|40th parallel]]. A problem arose when [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] granted a charter for [[Pennsylvania]]. The grant defined Pennsylvania's southern border as identical to Maryland's northern border, the 40th parallel. But the grant indicated that Charles II and [[William Penn]] assumed the 40th parallel would pass close to [[New Castle, Delaware]] when it falls north of [[Philadelphia]], the site of which Penn had already selected for his colony's capital city. Negotiations ensued after the problem was discovered in 1681.

The dispute remained unresolved for nearly a century, carried on by the descendants of William Penn and Lord Baltimore—the [[Baron Baltimore|Calvert family]], which controlled Maryland, and the [[William Penn|Penn family]], which controlled Pennsylvania.<ref name=hubbard/>

The border dispute with Pennsylvania led to Cresap's War in the 1730s. Hostilities erupted in 1730 and escalated through the first half of the decade, culminating in the deployment of military forces by Maryland in 1736 and by Pennsylvania in 1737. The armed phase of the conflict ended in May 1738 with the intervention of King George II, who compelled the negotiation of a cease-fire. A provisional agreement had been established in 1732.<ref name=hubbard/>

Negotiations continued until a final agreement was signed in 1760. The agreement defined the border between Maryland and Pennsylvania as the line of latitude now known as the [[Mason–Dixon line]]. Maryland's border with Delaware was based on a [[Transpeninsular Line]] and the [[Twelve-Mile Circle]] around New Castle.<ref name=hubbard/>

Most of the English colonists arrived in Maryland as [[indentured servant]]s, and had to serve a several years' term as laborers to pay for their passage.<ref>[http://www.folger.edu/html/folger_institute/jamestown/c_shifflet.htm "Indentured Servants and the Pursuits of Happiness"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104180311/http://www.folger.edu/html/folger_institute/jamestown/c_shifflet.htm |date=January 4, 2010 }}. Crandall Shifflett, ''Virginia Tech''.</ref> In the early years, the line between indentured servants and African slaves or laborers was fluid, and white and black laborers commonly lived and worked together, and formed unions. [[Mixed-race]] children born to white mothers were considered free by the principle of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'', by which children took the social status of their mothers, a principle of slave law that was adopted throughout the colonies, following Virginia in 1662.

Many of the free black families migrated to Delaware, where land was cheaper.<ref name="Heinegg">[http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/ Paul Heinegg.

Retrieved February 15, 2008.</ref> As the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in England, planters in Maryland imported thousands more slaves and racial caste lines hardened.

Maryland was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen colonies]] that revolted against British rule in the [[American Revolution]]. Near the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783), on February 2, 1781, Maryland became the last and 13th state to approve the ratification of the [[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]], first proposed in 1776 and adopted by the [[Second Continental Congress]] in 1778, which brought into being the United States as a united, [[sovereignty|sovereign]] and [[nation state|national state]]. It also became the seventh state admitted to the Union after ratifying the new federal Constitution in 1788. In December 1790, prior to the move of the national capital from [[Philadelphia]] in 1800, Maryland donated land selected by first President [[George Washington]] to the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] for its creation. The land was provided along the north shore of the [[Potomac River]] from [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]] and [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's]] counties, as well as from [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] and [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] on the south shore of the Potomac in [[Virginia]]; however, the land donated by the Commonwealth of Virginia was later returned to that state by the [[District of Columbia retrocession]] in 1846.

Influenced by a changing economy, revolutionary ideals, and preaching by ministers, numerous planters in Maryland freed their slaves in the 20 years after the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]]. Across the Upper South the free black population increased from less than 1% before the war to 14% by 1810.<ref name="Kolchin"/> Abolitionists [[Harriet Tubman]] and [[Frederick Douglass]] were born slaves during this time in [[Dorchester County, Maryland|Dorchester County]] and [[Talbot County, Maryland|Talbot County]], respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/harriet-tubman|title=Harriet Tubman|website=HISTORY|access-date=January 18, 2019|archive-date=January 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119121457/https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/harriet-tubman|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Douglass |first=Frederick |title=Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave |publisher=Barnes & Noble Classics |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-59308-041-9 |location=New York, NY |pages=17 |language=English}}</ref>

During the [[War of 1812]], the British military attempted to capture Baltimore, which was protected by [[Fort McHenry]]. During its bombardment the song "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" was written by [[Francis Scott Key]]; it was later adopted as the national anthem.

In April 1861, Federal units and state regiments were attacked as they marched through Baltimore, sparking the [[Baltimore riot of 1861]], the first bloodshed in the Civil War.<ref>{{cite web |last=Vogler |first=Mark E. |title=Civil War Guard on duty in Baltimore to save President Street Station |url=http://www.eagletribune.com/punews/local_story_107204538.html |date=April 18, 2009 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20090419134532/http://www.eagletribune.com/punews/local_story_107204538.html |archive-date=April 19, 2009 |url-status=dead |website=eagletribune.com |publisher=Eagle Tribune |access-date=April 28, 2015 }}</ref> Of the 115,000 Marylanders who joined the military during the Civil War, around 85,000, or 77%, joined the [[Union army]], while the remainder joined the [[Confederate Army]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The largest and most significant battle in the state was the [[Battle of Antietam]] on September 17, 1862, near [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]].

====Post-Civil War====
A new state constitution in 1864 [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolished]] slavery and Maryland was first recognized as a "Free State" in that context.<ref name=freestate>{{cite web |url=http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/01glance/html/nickname.html |title=Maryland at a Glance: Nicknames |publisher=Maryland State Archives |date=September 29, 2015 |access-date=February 8, 2018 |archive-date=January 22, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122110422/http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/01glance/html/nickname.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Following passage of constitutional amendments that granted voting rights to [[freedmen]], in 1867 the state extended suffrage to non-white males.

The [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] rapidly regained power in the state from [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republicans]]. Democrats replaced the Constitution of 1864 with the [[Maryland Constitution of 1867|Constitution of 1867]]. Following the end of Reconstruction in 1877, Democrats devised means of [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchising]] blacks, initially by physical intimidation and voter fraud, later by constitutional amendments and laws. Blacks and immigrants, however, resisted Democratic Party disfranchisement efforts in the state. Maryland blacks were part of a biracial Republican coalition elected to state government in 1896–1904 and comprised 20% of the electorate.<ref name="tuck">{{cite web |url=http://www.brandonkendhammer.com/democratization_Spring2013/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Tuck-2007.pdf |first=Stephen |last=Tuck |title=Democratization and the Disfranchisement of African Americans in the US South during the Late 19th Century |date=Spring 2013 |department=Reading for "Challenges of Democratization" |via=Brandon Kendhammer, Ohio University |author-link=Stephen Tuck |access-date=February 11, 2014 |archive-date=February 23, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223124800/http://www.brandonkendhammer.com/democratization_Spring2013/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Tuck-2007.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Compared to some other states, blacks were better established both before and after the civil war. Nearly half the black population was free before the war, and some had accumulated property. Half the population lived in cities. Literacy was high among blacks and, as Democrats crafted means to exclude them, suffrage campaigns helped reach blacks and teach them how to resist.<ref name="tuck"/> Whites did impose [[racial segregation]] in public facilities and [[Jim Crow]] laws, which effectively lasted until the passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.

Baltimore grew significantly during the [[Industrial Revolution]], due in large part to its seaport and good railroad connections, attracting European immigrant labor. Many manufacturing businesses were established in the Baltimore area after the Civil War. Baltimore businessmen, including [[Johns Hopkins]], [[Enoch Pratt]], [[George Peabody]], and [[Henry Walters]], founded notable city institutions that bear their names, including respectively a [[Johns Hopkins University|university]], [[Enoch Pratt Free Library|library system]], [[Peabody Institute|music and dance conservatory]], and [[Walters Art Museum|art museum]].

[[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]] was Maryland's second-largest city in the 19th century. Nearby supplies of natural resources along with railroads fostered its growth into a major manufacturing center.<ref name="WDL">{{cite web |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11374/ |title=Bird's Eye View of Cumberland, Maryland 1906 |website=[[World Digital Library]] |year=1906 |access-date=July 22, 2013 |archive-date=October 3, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003004014/http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11374/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===20th century===
[[File:Rubble_of_the_Great_Baltimore_Fire.jpg|thumb|The ruins left by the [[Great Baltimore Fire]] of 1904]]
The [[Progressive Era]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries brought political reforms. In a series of laws passed between 1892 and 1908, reformers worked for standard state-issued ballots (rather than those distributed and marked by the parties); obtained closed voting booths to prevent party workers from "assisting" voters; initiated [[Partisan primary|primary election]]s to keep party bosses from selecting candidates; and had candidates listed without party symbols, which discouraged the [[illiterate]] from participating. These measures worked against ill-educated whites and blacks. Blacks resisted such efforts, with suffrage groups conducting voter education.
Blacks defeated three efforts to disenfranchise them, making alliances with immigrants to resist various Democratic campaigns.<ref name="tuck"/> Disenfranchisement bills in 1905, 1907, and 1911 were rebuffed, in large part because of black opposition. Blacks comprised 20% of the electorate and immigrants comprised 15%, and the legislature had difficulty devising requirements against blacks that did not also disadvantage immigrants.<ref name="tuck"/>

The Progressive Era also brought reforms in working conditions for Maryland's labor force. In 1902, the state regulated conditions in [[Mining|mines]]; outlawed [[child labor]]ers under the age of 12; mandated compulsory school attendance; and enacted the nation's first [[workers' compensation]] law. The workers' compensation law was overturned in the courts, but was redrafted and finally enacted in 1910.

The [[Great Baltimore Fire]] of 1904 burned for more than 30 hours, destroying 1,526 buildings and spanning 70 city blocks. More than 1,231 [[firefighter]]s worked to bring the blaze under control.

With the nation's [[World War I#Entry of the United States|entry into World War I]] in 1917, new military bases such as [[Fort George G. Meade|Camp Meade]], the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], and the [[Edgewood Arsenal]] were established. Existing facilities, including [[Fort McHenry]], were greatly expanded.

After Georgia congressman [[William D. Upshaw]] criticized Maryland openly in 1923 for not passing [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] laws, ''Baltimore Sun'' editor Hamilton Owens coined the "Free State" nickname for Maryland in that context, which was popularized by [[H. L. Mencken]] in a series of newspaper editorials.<ref name=freestate /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/ph-ce-eagle-archive-1008-20121003-story.html |newspaper=The Baltimore Sun |date=October 7, 2012 |first=Kevin |last=Dayhoff |title=Eagle Archive: Here's a toast to Maryland's origins as 'The Free State' |access-date=February 8, 2018 |archive-date=February 9, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209063600/http://www.baltimoresun.com/ph-ce-eagle-archive-1008-20121003-story.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Maryland's urban and rural communities had different experiences during the [[Great Depression]]. The "[[Bonus Army]]" marched through the state in 1932 on its way to Washington, D.C. Maryland instituted its first [[income tax]] in 1937 to generate revenue for schools and welfare.<ref>{{cite web

Passenger and freight steamboat service, once important throughout Chesapeake Bay and its many tributary rivers, ended in 1962.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Steamboats of Chesapeake Bay |url=https://www.calvertmarinemuseum.com/DocumentCenter/View/2347/-Bugeye-Times-Winter-2017?bidId= |access-date=March 9, 2020 |archive-date=August 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804222419/http://calvertmarinemuseum.com/DocumentCenter/View/2347/-Bugeye-Times-Winter-2017?bidId= |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Baltimore was a major war production center during [[World War II]]. The biggest operations were [[Bethlehem Steel]]'s Fairfield Yard, which built [[Liberty ship]]s; and [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Glenn Martin]], an aircraft manufacturer.

Maryland experienced population growth following World War II. Beginning in the 1960s, as suburban growth took hold around Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, the state began to take on a more mid-Atlantic culture as opposed to the traditionally Southern and Tidewater culture that previously dominated most of the state. Agricultural tracts gave way to residential communities, some of them carefully planned such as [[Columbia, Maryland|Columbia]], [[St. Charles, Maryland|St. Charles]], and [[Montgomery Village, Maryland|Montgomery Village]]. Concurrently the [[Interstate Highway System]] was built throughout the state, most notably [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]], [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|I-695]], and the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Capital Beltway]], altering travel patterns. In 1952, the eastern and western halves of Maryland were linked for the first time by the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]], which replaced a nearby [[ferry]] service.<ref name="baybridge.com-history">{{cite web|url=http://www.baybridge.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=|title=William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial Bay Bridge—History|publisher=baybridge.com|access-date=February 5, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701104741/http://www.baybridge.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=|archive-date=July 1, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Maryland's regions experienced economic changes following WWII. Heavy manufacturing declined in Baltimore. In Maryland's four westernmost counties, industrial, railroad, and coal mining jobs declined. On the lower [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]], family farms were bought up by major concerns and large-scale poultry farms and vegetable farming became prevalent. In Southern Maryland, tobacco farming nearly vanished due to suburban development and a state tobacco buy-out program in the 1990s.

In an effort to reverse depopulation due to the loss of working-class industries, Baltimore initiated [[urban renewal]] projects in the 1960s with [[Charles Center]] and the [[Baltimore World Trade Center]]. Some resulted in the break-up of intact residential neighborhoods, producing social volatility, and some older residential areas around the harbor have had units renovated and have become popular with new populations.

Maryland is bounded on its north by [[Pennsylvania]], on its north and east by [[Delaware]], on its east by the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and on its south and west, across the [[Potomac River]], by [[West Virginia]] and [[Virginia]]. The mid-portion of its border with Virginia is interrupted by [[Washington, D.C.]], which sits on land that was originally part of [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]] and [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's]] counties and including [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown, Maryland]], which was ceded to the United States federal government in 1790 to form the Washington, D.C. [[Chesapeake Bay]] nearly bisects the state, and the counties east of the bay are known collectively as the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]].

Most of the state's waterways are part of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, with the exceptions of a tiny portion of extreme western [[Garrett County, Maryland|Garrett County]] (drained by the [[Youghiogheny River]] as part of the watershed of the [[Mississippi River]]), the eastern half of Worcester County (which drains into Maryland's Atlantic coastal bays), and a small portion of the state's northeast corner (which drains into the [[Delaware River]] watershed). So prominent is the Chesapeake in Maryland's geography and economic life that there has been periodic agitation to change the state's official nickname to the "Bay State", a nickname that has been used by [[Massachusetts]] for decades.

The highest point in Maryland, with an elevation of {{convert|3360|ft|m}}, is [[Backbone Mountain|Hoye Crest on Backbone Mountain]], in the southwest corner of [[Garrett County, Maryland|Garrett County]], near the border with West Virginia, and near the headwaters of the North Branch of the Potomac River.

|quote=Historically bobcats were distributed statewide but during the post colonization period densities began to plummet. By the mid-1900s, populations had probably reached all-time lows, with remnant populations existing only in western Maryland. This prompted the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to classify them as a state-listed "Species of Special Concern." During the past quarter century, occupied range and densities have increased markedly. Results from the annual Bowhunter Survey and the Hunter Mail survey have identified bobcat sightings in 14 of Maryland's 23 counties. Currently, bobcats have dual legal classification in Maryland. In addition to the Species of Special Concern designation, they are also defined as a Game Animal / Furbearer with a closed harvest season.

|quote=Coyotes were historically a western species with core populations found west of the Mississippi River. Alterations and/or elimination of competing predators during the post-European colonization period facilitated rapid range expansion into eastern North America during the 20th Century. Established populations now occur in every state and province in North America. Coyotes are a relatively new addition to local ecosystems, and were first documented in Maryland during 1972. Initial substantiated sightings occurred in Cecil, Frederick and Washington counties. Since that time population densities and occupied range have expanded incrementally and coyotes now occur statewide.

Maryland has a wide array of climates, due to local variances in elevation, proximity to water, and protection from colder weather due to [[Katabatic wind|downslope winds]].
The eastern half of Maryland, which includes [[Ocean City, Maryland|Ocean City]], [[Salisbury, Maryland|Salisbury]], [[Annapolis]], and the southern and eastern suburbs of Washington, D.C., and [[Baltimore]], lies on the [[Atlantic Coastal Plain]], with flat topography and sandy or muddy soil.

The [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region, which includes northern and western greater Baltimore, [[Westminster, Maryland|Westminster]], [[Gaithersburg, Maryland|Gaithersburg]], [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], and [[Hagerstown, Maryland|Hagerstown]], has average seasonal snowfall totals generally exceeding {{convert|20|in|cm}}, and, as part of USDA Hardiness zones 7b and 7a,<ref name="Arbor Day Foundation" /> temperatures below {{convert|10|°F|0}} are less rare. From the [[Cumberland Valley]] on westward, the climate begins to transition to a [[humid continental climate]] (Köppen ''Dfa'').

In western Maryland, the higher elevations of [[Allegany County, Maryland|Allegany]] and [[Garrett County, Maryland|Garrett]] counties, including the cities of [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]], [[Frostburg, Maryland|Frostburg]], and [[Oakland, Maryland|Oakland]], display more characteristics of the humid continental zone, due in part to elevation. They fall under USDA Hardiness zones 6b and below.<ref name="Arbor Day Foundation" />

Precipitation in the state is characteristic of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. Annual rainfall ranges from {{convert|35|to|45|in|mm}} with more in higher elevations. Nearly every part of Maryland receives {{convert|3.5|–|4.5|in|mm}} per month of rain. Average annual snowfall varies from {{convert|9|in|cm}} in the coastal areas to over {{convert|100|in|cm}} in the western mountains of the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/lwx/Historic_Events/md-snow-avg.gif |title=Snowfall Map |access-date=October 24, 2010 |archive-date=May 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522020512/http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/lwx/Historic_Events/md-snow-avg.gif |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Because of its location near the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]], Maryland is somewhat vulnerable to [[tropical cyclones]], although the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] and the outer banks of [[North Carolina]] provide a large buffer, such that strikes from major hurricanes (category{{spaces}}3 or above) occur infrequently. More often, Maryland gets the remnants of a tropical system that has already come ashore and released most of its energy. Maryland averages around 30–40 days of thunderstorms a year, and averages around six tornado strikes annually.<ref name="Annual average number of tornadoes">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |title=NOAA National Climatic Data Center.

=== Cities and metro areas ===
{{See also|Maryland statistical areas}}
[[File:Maryland population map.png|thumb|Maryland population distribution map; Maryland's population is concentrated mostly in the [[Washington–Baltimore combined statistical area]].]]
Most of the population of Maryland lives in the central region of the state, in the [[Baltimore metropolitan area]] and [[Washington metropolitan area]], both of which are part of the [[Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area]]. The majority of Maryland's population is concentrated in the cities and suburbs surrounding [[Washington, D.C.]], and in and around [[Baltimore]], Maryland's most populous city. Historically, these and many other Maryland cities developed along the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]], the line along which rivers, brooks, and streams are interrupted by rapids and waterfalls. Maryland's capital city, [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], is one exception to this pattern since it lies along the banks of the [[Severn River (Maryland)|Severn River]], close to where it empties into the [[Chesapeake Bay]].

The Eastern Shore is less populous and more rural, as are the counties of western Maryland. The two westernmost counties of Maryland, [[Allegany County, Maryland|Allegany]] and [[Garrett County, Maryland|Garrett]], are mountainous and sparsely populated, resembling West Virginia and [[Appalachia]] more than they do the rest of the state. Both eastern and western Maryland are, however, dotted with cities of regional importance, such as [[Ocean City, Maryland|Ocean City]], [[Princess Anne, Maryland|Princess Anne]], and [[Salisbury, Maryland|Salisbury]] on the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]] and [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]], [[Frostburg, Maryland|Frostburg]], and [[Hancock, Maryland|Hancock]] in [[Western Maryland]]. Southern Maryland is still somewhat rural, but suburbanization from Washington, D.C., has encroached significantly since the 1960s; important local population centers include [[Lexington Park, Maryland|Lexington Park]], [[Prince Frederick, Maryland|Prince Frederick]], [[California, Maryland|California]], and [[Waldorf, Maryland|Waldorf]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/P1000II5.TXT?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&Client=EPA&Index=2000+Thru+2005&Docs=&Query=&Time=&EndTime=&SearchMethod=1&TocRestrict=n&Toc=&TocEntry=&QField=&QFieldYear=&QFieldMonth=&QFieldDay=&IntQFieldOp=0&ExtQFieldOp=0&XmlQuery=&File=D%3A%5Czyfiles%5CIndex%20Data%5C00thru05%5CTxt%5C00000014%5CP1000II5.txt&User=ANONYMOUS&Password=anonymous&SortMethod=h%7C-&MaximumDocuments=1&FuzzyDegree=0&ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&Display=hpfr&DefSeekPage=x&SearchBack=ZyActionL&Back=ZyActionS&BackDesc=Results%20page&MaximumPages=1&ZyEntry=1&SeekPage=x&ZyPURL |title=Calvert County, Maryland's Success in Controlling Sprawl |publisher=Environmental Protection Agency |access-date=September 3, 2016 |archive-date=September 13, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913223055/https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/P1000II5.TXT?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&Client=EPA&Index=2000+Thru+2005&Docs=&Query=&Time=&EndTime=&SearchMethod=1&TocRestrict=n&Toc=&TocEntry=&QField=&QFieldYear=&QFieldMonth=&QFieldDay=&IntQFieldOp=0&ExtQFieldOp=0&XmlQuery=&File=D%3A%5Czyfiles%5CIndex%20Data%5C00thru05%5CTxt%5C00000014%5CP1000II5.txt&User=ANONYMOUS&Password=anonymous&SortMethod=h%7C-&MaximumDocuments=1&FuzzyDegree=0&ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&Display=hpfr&DefSeekPage=x&SearchBack=ZyActionL&Back=ZyActionS&BackDesc=Results%20page&MaximumPages=1&ZyEntry=1&SeekPage=x&ZyPURL |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/library/growth/part1/southmd.htm |title=On Edge |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=February 16, 1997 |access-date=September 3, 2016 |author=Shields, Todd |archive-date=September 17, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917123821/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/library/growth/part1/southmd.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the [[2020 United States Census|2020 United States census]], the [[United States Census Bureau]] found that population of Maryland was 6,185,278 people, a 7.1% increase from the [[2010 United States Census|2010 United States census]].<ref name="censusdata"/> The United States Census Bureau estimated that the population of Maryland was 6,045,680 on July 1, 2019, a 4.71% increase from the 2010 United States census and an increase of 2,962, from the prior year. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 269,166 (464,251 births minus 275,093 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 116,713 people into the state.

Maryland's history as a [[border states (Civil War)|border state]] has led it to exhibit characteristics of both the [[Northern United States|Northern]] and the [[Southern United States|Southern]] regions of the United States.

[[African Americans in Maryland|African Americans]] form a sizable portion of the state's population, 31.1% as of 2020.<ref name="census.gov" /> Most are descendants of people transported to the area as slaves from West Africa. Concentrations of African Americans live in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore City]], [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]], [[Charles County, Maryland|Charles County]], western parts of [[Baltimore County, Maryland|Baltimore County]], and the southern Eastern Shore. Charles County and Prince George's County are the two counties where African Americans are the most successful monetarily in the country, with average household incomes much higher than in the rest of the country. As a former slave state, Maryland has had a large African-American population for much of its history; African American populations have increased over time with the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to the D.C. and Baltimore areas, and in more recent times with the [[New Great Migration]] and with movement out from Washington D.C. into Montgomery, Prince George's, and Charles counties, as a result of gentrification and rising housing costs in D.C. causing many African Americans to leave. Prince George's County in particular has been a magnet for African Americans from D.C. to move to for decades; it is often referred to as "Ward 9" of D.C.

Maryland has by far the highest percentage of residents born in Africa out of any state; residents of African descent include 20th-century and later immigrants from [[Nigerian American|Nigeria]], particularly of the [[Igbo American|Igbo]] and [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] tribes; [[Ethiopia]], particularly [[Amhara people|Amharas]] with significant [[Oromo people|Oromo]] and [[Tigrayans|Tigrayan]] populations; [[Cameroon]], [[Ghana]], [[Sierra Leone]], and [[Kenya]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usefoundation.org/userdata/file/Research/Regions/maryland.pdf |title=Languages in Maryland |quote=Prince George's County has the highest percentage of Kru/Ibo/Yoruba speakers of any county in the nation. |publisher=U.S. English Foundation, Inc |access-date=May 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117073348/http://www.usefoundation.org/userdata/file/Research/Regions/maryland.pdf |archive-date=January 17, 2013 }}</ref> Maryland also hosts populations from other African and [[West Indian American|Caribbean]] nations.

Many immigrants from the [[Horn of Africa]], especially [[Ethiopia]], have settled in Maryland, with large communities in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., particularly in Montgomery and Prince George's counties.

Maryland has been historically prominent to [[Catholic Church in the United States|American Catholic tradition]] because the English [[colony of Maryland]] was intended by [[George Calvert]] as a haven for English Catholics. Baltimore was the seat of the first Catholic bishop in the U.S. (1789), and [[Emmitsburg]] was the home and burial place of the first American-born citizen to be [[canonized]], [[St. Elizabeth Ann Seton]]. [[Georgetown University]], the first Catholic University, was founded in 1789 in what was then part of Maryland; it became a part of the District of Columbia when it was created in the 1790s. The [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary]] in Baltimore was the first Roman Catholic cathedral built in the United States, and the [[Archbishop of Baltimore]] is, albeit without formal primacy, the United States' quasi-[[primate (bishop)|primate]],{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} and often a cardinal. Among the immigrants of the 19th and 20th centuries from eastern and southern Europe were many Catholics.

Despite its historic relevance to the Catholic Church in the United States, the percentage of Catholics in the state of Maryland is below the national average of 20%. Demographically, both Protestants and those identifying with no religion are more numerous than Catholics.

=== LGBT population ===
{{Main|LGBT rights in Maryland}}
Maryland has one of the highest percentages of LGBT people in its populace out of any state; 5.7% of Marylanders identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer, the highest of any state. (Washington, D.C. ranks higher with a LGBT population of 8.6%.) Maryland ranks as one of the best states in the nation for rights of the LGBT community, with protections against discrimination enacted since 2001 for sexuality and 2014 for gender, same-sex marriage legalization in 2013, bans on conversion therapy enacted in 2018, abolition of the gay panic defense in 2021, and issuance in 2023 of an executive order protecting the rights of transgender individuals. In 2020, Montgomery County unanimously passed an ordinance implementing an LGBTIQ+ bill of rights.

The first person known to describe himself as a [[drag queen]] was [[William Dorsey Swann]], born enslaved in Hancock, Maryland. Swann was the first American on record who pursued legal and political action to defend the [[LGBTQ community]]'s [[right to assemble]].<ref name=":6">{{Cite news |last=Joseph |first=Channing Gerard |date=January 31, 2020 |title=The First Drag Queen Was a Former Slave |journal=The Nation |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/society/drag-queen-slave-ball/ |url-status=live |access-date=February 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210202152031/https://www.thenation.com/article/society/drag-queen-slave-ball/ |archive-date=February 2, 2021 |issn=0027-8378}}</ref>

In February 2010, Attorney General [[Doug Gansler]] issued an opinion stating that Maryland law should honor [[same-sex marriage]]s from out of state. At the time, the state Supreme Court wrote a decision upholding marriage discrimination.<ref name="freedomtomarry.org" />

On March 1, 2012, Maryland Governor [[Martin O'Malley]] signed the freedom to marry bill into law after it passed in the state legislature. Opponents of same-sex marriage began collecting signatures to overturn the law, which faced a referendum, as Question 6, in the November 2012 election.<ref name="freedomtomarry.org" /> A January 2011 Gonzales Research & Marketing Strategies poll showed 51% support for marriage in the state.<ref>{{cite web |date=May 24, 2012 |title=Maryland Polling Memo |url=http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/05/maryland-polling-memo.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803202911/http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/05/maryland-polling-memo.html |archive-date=August 3, 2017 |access-date=August 16, 2013 |publisher=Public Policy Polling}}</ref>

In May 2012, Maryland's Court of Appeals ruled that the state will recognize marriages of same-sex couples who married out-of-state, no matter the outcome of the November election.<ref name="freedomtomarry.org" />  Voters upheld the bill, passing Question 6 with 52% to 48% on November 6, 2012.

Maryland's economy benefits from the state's proximity to the federal government in [[Washington, D.C.]], with an emphasis on technical and administrative tasks for the defense/aerospace industry and bio-research laboratories, as well as staffing of satellite government headquarters in the suburban or exurban Baltimore/Washington area. Ft. Meade serves as the headquarters of the [[Defense Information Systems Agency]], [[United States Cyber Command]], and the [[National Security Agency]]/[[Central Security Service]]. In addition, a number of educational and medical research institutions are located in the state. In fact, the various components of The [[Johns Hopkins University]] and its medical research facilities are now the largest single employer in the Baltimore area.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}} Altogether, [[White-collar worker|white collar]] technical and administrative workers comprise 25 percent of Maryland's [[labor force]],{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} attributable in part to nearby Maryland being a part of the [[Washington Metro Area]] where the federal government office employment is relatively high.

Manufacturing, while large in dollar value, is highly diversified with no sub-sector contributing over 20 percent of the total. Typical forms of manufacturing include electronics, computer equipment, and chemicals. The once-mighty primary metals sub-sector, which once included what was then the largest steel factory in the world at [[Sparrows Point]], still exists, but is pressed with foreign competition, [[Bankruptcy|bankruptcies]], and [[merger]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}} During World War II, the Glenn Martin Company (now part of [[Lockheed Martin]]) airplane factory employed some 40,000 people.

Mining other than construction materials is virtually limited to coal, which is located in the mountainous western part of the state. The brownstone quarries in the east, which gave Baltimore and Washington much of their characteristic architecture in the mid-19th century, were once a predominant natural resource. Historically, there used to be small gold-mining operations in Maryland, some near Washington, but these no longer exist.

===Fishing===
Maryland has a large food-production sector. A large component of this is commercial [[List of freshwater fishes of Maryland|fishing]], centered in the Chesapeake Bay, but also including activity off the short Atlantic seacoast. The largest catches by species are the [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crab]], [[oysters]], [[striped bass]], and [[menhaden]]. The Bay also has overwintering waterfowl in its wildlife refuges. The waterfowl support a [[birdwatching|tourism sector of sportsmen]].

===Agriculture===
{{main|Agriculture in Maryland}}
[[File:CarrollCountyMD.jpg|thumb|Agriculture is an important part of Maryland's economy.]]
Maryland has large areas of fertile agricultural land in its coastal and [[Piedmont Plateau|Piedmont]] zones, though this land use is being encroached upon by urbanization. Agriculture is oriented to dairy farming (especially in foothill and piedmont areas) for nearby large city milksheads, plus specialty perishable horticulture crops, such as [[cucumber]]s, [[watermelon]]s, [[sweet corn]], [[tomato]]es, [[Cucumis melo|melons]], [[Squash (fruit)|squash]], and [[peas]] (Source:USDA Crop Profiles). The southern counties of the western shoreline of Chesapeake Bay are warm enough to support a [[tobacco]] [[cash crop]] zone, which has existed since early Colonial times, but declined greatly after a state government buy-out in the 1990s. There is also a large automated [[chicken]]-farming sector in the state's southeastern part; [[Salisbury, Maryland|Salisbury]] is home to [[Perdue Farms]]. Maryland's food-processing plants are the most significant type of manufacturing by value in the state. Farming suffers from weeds as anywhere else, including an unusual [[multiple herbicide resistance|multiply resistant]] ragweed (''[[Ambrosia artemisiifolia]]'') found by Rousonelos ''et al.'', 2012 with both [[ALS resistance|ALS-]] and [[PPO resistance|PPO]]-resistances<ref name="Rousonelos-et-al-2012">{{cite journal |last1=Rousonelos |first1=Stephanie L. |last2=Lee |first2=Ryan M. |last3=Moreira |first3=Murilo S. |last4=VanGessel |first4=Mark J. |last5=Tranel |first5=Patrick J. |title=Characterization of a Common Ragweed (''Ambrosia artemisiifolia'') Population Resistant to ALS- and PPO-Inhibiting Herbicides |journal=[[Weed Science (journal)|Weed Science]] |publisher=[[Weed Science Society of America]] (WSSA) ([[Cambridge University Press|CUP]]) |volume=60 |issue=3 |year=2012 |issn=0043-1745 |doi=10.1614/ws-d-11-00152.1 |pages=335–344| s2cid=86234767 }}</ref> and which by 2016 had developed a third, [[EPSP resistance]].<ref name="Heap-2022">{{cite web |last=Heap |first=Ian |title=Multiple resistant ''Ambrosia artemisiifolia'' from United States, Maryland |website=The International Survey of Herbicide Resistant Weeds |date=May 7, 2022 |url=http://www.weedscience.org/details/Case.aspx?ResistID=17109 |access-date=May 7, 2022 |archive-date=May 17, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220517232813/https://www.weedscience.org/Details/Case.aspx?ResistID=17109 |url-status=live }}</ref> This ragweed population is a drag on [[soybean]] cultivation and, {{as of|2022|05|07|lc=yes|df=US}}, is the worst multiresistant weed problem in the state.<ref name="Heap-2022" />

[[File:Chesapeake Bay Bridge viewed from Sandy Point State Park.jpg|thumb|The [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]], which connects Maryland's [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern]] and Western Shores]]
Maryland's [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate highways]] include {{convert|110|mi|km}} of [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|Interstate{{spaces}}95]] (I-95), which enters the northeast portion of the state, travels through [[Baltimore]], and becomes part of the eastern section of the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Capital Beltway]] to the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]]. [[Interstate 68 in Maryland|I-68]] travels {{convert|81|mi|km}}, connecting the western portions of the state to [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|I-70]] at the small town of Hancock. I-70 enters from Pennsylvania north of Hancock and continues east for {{convert|93|mi|km}} to Baltimore, connecting [[Hagerstown, Maryland|Hagerstown]] and [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]] along the way.

[[Interstate 83 in Maryland|I-83]] has {{convert|34|mi|km}} in Maryland and connects Baltimore to southern central Pennsylvania ([[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] and [[York, Pennsylvania]]). Maryland also has an {{convert|11|mi|km|adj=on}} portion of [[Interstate 81 in Maryland|I-81]] that travels through the state near Hagerstown. [[Interstate 97|I-97]], fully contained within Anne Arundel County and the shortest ({{convert|17.6|mi|km}}) one- or two-digit interstate highway in the contiguous US, connects the Baltimore area to the Annapolis area.

There are also several [[List of auxiliary Interstate Highways|auxiliary Interstate highways]] in Maryland. Among them are two beltways encircling the major cities of the region: [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|I-695]], the McKeldin (Baltimore) Beltway, which encircles Baltimore; and a portion of [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|I-495]], the Capital Beltway, which encircles [[Washington, D.C.]] [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|I-270]], which connects the Frederick area with [[Northern Virginia]] and Washington, D.C. through major suburbs to the northwest of Washington, is a major commuter route and is as wide as fourteen lanes at points. [[Interstate 895 (Maryland)|I-895]], also known as the Harbor Tunnel Thruway, provides an alternate route to I-95 across [[Baltimore Harbor]].

Both I-270 and the Capital Beltway were extremely [[Traffic congestion|congested]]; however, the [[Intercounty Connector]] (ICC; [[Maryland Route 200|MD{{spaces}}200]]) has alleviated some congestion over time. Construction of the ICC was a major part of the campaign platform of former Governor [[Robert Ehrlich]], who was in office from 2003 until 2007, and of Governor [[Martin O'Malley]], who succeeded him. [[Interstate 595 (Maryland)|I-595]], which is an [[unsigned highway]] concurrent with [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|US{{spaces}}50]]/[[U.S. Route 301 in Maryland|US{{spaces}}301]], is the longest unsigned interstate in the country and connects [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]] and Washington, D.C. with [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]] and the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]] via the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]].

Maryland also has a [[state highway]] system that contains routes numbered from 2{{spaces}}through 999, however most of the higher-numbered routes are either unsigned or are relatively short. Major state highways include Routes [[Maryland Route 2|2]] (Governor Ritchie Highway/Solomons Island Road/Southern Maryland Blvd.), [[Maryland Route 4|4]] ([[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]]/Southern Maryland Blvd./Patuxent Beach Road/St. Andrew's Church Road), [[Maryland Route 5|5]] (Branch Avenue/Leonardtown Road/Point Lookout Road), [[Maryland Route 32|32]], [[Maryland Route 45|45]] (York Road), [[Maryland Route 97|97]] (Georgia Avenue), [[Maryland Route 100|100]] (Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway), [[Maryland Route 210|210]] (Indian Head Highway), [[Maryland Route 235|235]] (Three Notch Road), [[Maryland Route 295|295]] (Baltimore-Washington Parkway), [[Maryland Route 355|355]] (Wisconsin Avenue/Rockville Pike/Frederick Road), [[Maryland Route 404|404]] (Queen Anne Highway/ Shore Highway), and [[Maryland Route 650|650]] (New Hampshire Avenue).

===Airports===

The only other airports with commercial service are at [[Hagerstown Regional Airport|Hagerstown]] and [[Wicomico Regional Airport|Salisbury]].

The Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C. are also served by the other two airports in the region, [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]] and [[Dulles International Airport]], both in [[Northern Virginia]].

The [[Maryland Transit Administration]] (often abbreviated as "MTA Maryland"), a state agency part of the [[Maryland Department of Transportation]] also provides transit services within the state. Headquartered in Baltimore, MTA's transit services are largely focused on central Maryland, as well as some portions of the Eastern Shore and Southern MD. Baltimore's [[Baltimore Light RailLink|Light RailLink]] and [[Baltimore Metro SubwayLink|Metro SubwayLink]] systems serve its densely populated inner-city and the surrounding suburbs. The MTA also serves the city and its suburbs with its [[MTA Maryland bus service|local bus]] service (the [[List of United States local bus agencies by ridership|9th largest system]] in the nation). The MTA's [[Maryland Transit Administration#Commuter bus|Commuter Bus]] system provides express coach service on longer routes connecting Washington, D.C. and Baltimore to parts of Central and Southern MD as well as the Eastern Shore. The commuter rail service, known as [[Maryland Area Rail Commuter|MARC]], operates three lines which all terminate at [[Washington Union Station]] and provide service to Baltimore's [[Baltimore Penn Station|Penn]] and [[Camden Station|Camden]] stations, [[Perryville, Maryland|Perryville]], [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], and [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]]. In addition, many suburban counties operate local bus systems which connect to and complement the larger MTA and WMATA/Metro services.

The MTA will also administer the [[Purple Line (Maryland)|Purple Line]], an under-construction light rail line that will connect the Maryland branches of the [[Red Line (Washington Metro)|Red]], [[Green Line (Washington Metro)|Green]]/[[Yellow Line (Washington Metro)|Yellow]], and [[Orange Line (Washington Metro)|Orange]] lines of the Washington Metro, as well as offer transfers to all three lines of the MARC commuter rail system.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Purple Line|url=https://www.purplelinemd.com/|access-date=January 12, 2021|website=MDOT MTA Purple Line|archive-date=January 14, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210114234508/https://www.purplelinemd.com/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Shaver|first=Katherine|date=December 16, 2020|title=Maryland board approves $250 million legal deal to complete Purple Line construction|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/maryland-purple-line/2020/12/16/5a370bb8-3fb0-11eb-8bc0-ae155bee4aff_story.html|access-date=January 12, 2021|issn=0190-8286|archive-date=January 14, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210114090513/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/maryland-purple-line/2020/12/16/5a370bb8-3fb0-11eb-8bc0-ae155bee4aff_story.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Law and government==
{{Main|Government of Maryland}}
{{See also|List of Governors of Maryland|Maryland Army National Guard|Maryland Air National Guard}}
[[File:Annapolis2.jpg|thumb|The [[Maryland State House]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]] dates to 1772, and houses the Maryland General Assembly and offices of the [[Governor of Maryland|governor]].]]
[[File:Maryland state coat of arms (illustrated, 1876).jpg|thumb|The [[Historical coats of arms of the U.S. states|historical coat of arms]] of Maryland in 1876]]
The [[government of Maryland]] is conducted according to the [[Maryland Constitution|state constitution]]. The government of Maryland, like the other 49 [[Politics of the United States#Local government|state governments]], has exclusive authority over matters that lie entirely within the state's borders, except as limited by the [[Constitution of the United States]].

Power in Maryland is divided among three branches of government: [[executive branch|executive]], [[legislative branch|legislative]], and [[judicial branch|judicial]]. The [[Maryland General Assembly]] is composed of the [[Maryland House of Delegates]] and the [[Maryland Senate]]. [[Governor of Maryland|Maryland's governor]] is unique in the United States as the office is vested with significant authority in budgeting. Unlike many other states, significant autonomy is granted to many of Maryland's [[County (United States)|counties]].

Most of the business of government is conducted in [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], the state [[Capital (political)|capital]]; however some cabinet departments and state officials have their offices in [[Baltimore]]. Elections for governor and most statewide offices, as well as most county elections, are held in [[United States midterm election|midterm-election years]] (even-numbered years not divisible by four).

The judicial branch of state government consists of one united [[Maryland District Court|District Court of Maryland]] that sits in every county and Baltimore City, as well as 24 [[Maryland Circuit Courts|Circuit Courts]] sitting in each County and Baltimore City, the latter being courts of general jurisdiction for all civil disputes over $30,000, all equitable jurisdiction and major criminal proceedings. The intermediate appellate court is known as the [[Appellate Court of Maryland]] and the [[state supreme court]] is the [[Supreme Court of Maryland]]. The appearance of the justices of the Supreme Court of Maryland is unique; Maryland is the only state whose justices wear red robes.<ref>Lamy, Rudolf B. (2006).

In [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]], Maryland was one of six states to vote for [[Jimmy Carter]]. In [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]], [[Bill Clinton]] fared better in Maryland than any other state, except his home state of [[Arkansas]]. In [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], Maryland was Clinton's sixth best; in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]], Maryland ranked fourth for Gore; and in [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]], [[John Kerry]] showed his fifth-best performance in Maryland. In [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], [[Barack Obama]] won the state's 10 electoral votes with 61.9 percent of the vote, to [[John McCain]]'s 36.5 percent.

In 2002, former Governor [[Robert Ehrlich]] was the first Republican to be elected to that office in four decades, and after one term, he lost his seat to [[Baltimore Mayor]] and Democrat [[Martin O'Malley]]. Ehrlich ran again for governor in 2010, losing again to O'Malley.

The 2006 election brought no change in the pattern of Democratic dominance. After Democratic Senator [[Paul Sarbanes]] announced that he was retiring, Democratic Congressman [[Benjamin Cardin]] defeated Republican Lieutenant Governor [[Michael S. Steele]], with 55 percent of the vote, against Steele's 44 percent.

While Republicans typically win more counties in statewide elections by piling up large margins in the west and east, they are usually overcome by the densely populated and solidly Democratic Baltimore–Washington axis. In [[2008 United States presidential election in Maryland|2008]], for instance, McCain won 17 counties to Obama's six (plus Baltimore City). While McCain won most of the western and eastern counties by margins of 2-to-1 or more, he was almost completely shut out in the larger counties surrounding Baltimore and Washington; every large county except Anne Arundel went for Obama, who won by 25 points statewide.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/individual/#mapPMD Local and National Election Results—Election Center 2008—Elections & Politics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081107105721/http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/individual/#mapPMD |date=November 7, 2008 }}.
