Conversely, ''Buda'' colloquially means all districts to the Danube's west—including the former Óbuda. The Danube islands—including [[Csepel]], the city's XXI. district—are part of neither Buda nor Pest. 

All varieties of English pronounce the ''-s-'' as in the English word ''pest''. The ''-u'' in ''Buda-'' is pronounced either /u/ like ''food'' (as in {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|b|uː|d|ə|p|ɛ|s|t}}<ref>{{citation |last=Wells |first=John C. |year=2008 |title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary |edition=3rd |publisher=Longman |isbn=978-1-4058-8118-0}}</ref>) or /ju/ like ''cue'' (as in {{IPAc-en|UK|ˌ|b|(|j|)|uː|d|ə|ˈ|p|ɛ|s|t|,_|ˌ|b|ʊ|d|-|,_|ˈ|b|(|j|)|uː|d|ə|p|ɛ|s|t|,_|ˈ|b|ʊ|d|-}}). In Hungarian, the ''-s-'' is pronounced /ʃ/ as in ''wash''; in IPA: {{IPA-hu|ˈbudɒpɛʃt|lang|Hu-Budapest.ogg}}.

The origins of the names "Buda" and "Pest" are obscure. Buda was

According to a legend recorded in chronicles from the [[Middle Ages]], "Buda" comes from the name of its founder, [[Bleda]], brother of Hunnic ruler [[Attila]].

{{Blockquote|[[Attila]] went in the city of Sicambria in Pannonia, where he killed [[Bleda|Buda]], his brother, and he threw his corpse into the [[Danube]]. For while [[Attila]] was in the west, his brother crossed the boundaries in his reign, because he named Sicambria after his own name Buda's Castle. And though King [[Attila]] forbade the Huns and the other peoples to call that city Buda's Castle, but he called it Attila's Capital, the Germans who were terrified by the prohibition named the city as Eccylburg, which means Attila Castle, however, the Hungarians did not care about the ban and call it Óbuda [Old Buda] and call it to this day.|[[Mark of Kalt]]: ''[[Chronicon Pictum]]''<ref>''Mark of Kalt: Chronicon Pictum'' https://mek.oszk.hu/10600/10642/10642.htm</ref>}}

{{Blockquote|The [[Scythians]] are certainly an ancient people and the strength of [[Scythia]] lies in the east, as we said above. And the first king of [[Scythia]] was Magog, son of Japhet, and his people were called Magyars [Hungarians] after their King Magog, from whose royal line the most renowned and mighty King [[Attila]] descended, who, in the 451st year of Our Lord's birth, coming down from [[Scythia]], entered Pannonia with a mighty force and, putting the Romans to flight, took the realm and made a royal residence for himself beside the [[Danube]] above the hot springs, and he ordered all the old buildings that he found there to be restored and he built them in a circular and very strong wall that in the Hungarian language is now called Budavár [Buda Castle] and by the Germans Etzelburg [Attila Castle]|[[Anonymus (notary of Béla III)|Anonymus]]: ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]''<ref>''Anonymus, Notary of King Béla: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/18975/1/18975.pdf</ref>}}

[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - BVJA.png|left|thumb|upright=2.05|[[Buda]] during the [[Middle Ages]], woodcut from the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]] (1493)]]

The first settlement on the territory of Budapest was built by [[Celts]]<ref name=Aqua /> before 1&nbsp;AD. It was later occupied by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The Roman settlement – [[Aquincum]] – became the main city of [[Pannonia (Roman province)|Pannonia Inferior]] in 106&nbsp;AD.<ref name=Aqua /> At first it was a military settlement, and gradually the city rose around it, making it the focal point of the city's commercial life.

[[File:Reprise Buda 1686.jpg|thumb|right|''Retaking of Buda from the Ottoman Empire'', painted by [[Frans Geffels]] in 1686]]

The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] conquered Buda in 1526, as well as in 1529, and finally occupied it in 1541.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/400 |title=Budapest, including the Banks of the Danube, the Buda Castle Quarter and Andrássy Avenue |author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=UNESCO |access-date=12 March 2016}}</ref> The [[Ottoman Hungary|Ottoman Rule]] lasted for more than 150 years.<ref name=Encarta /> The Ottoman [[Turkish people|Turks]] constructed many prominent bathing facilities within the city.<ref name=Travel /> Some of the baths that the Turks erected during their rule are still in use 500 years later, including [[Rudas Baths]] and [[Király Baths]].

Sugar page 88" /> The unoccupied western part of the country became part of the [[Habsburg monarchy]] as [[Royal Hungary]].

In 1686, two years after the unsuccessful [[siege of Buda (1684)|siege of Buda]], a renewed campaign was started to enter Buda. This time, the [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]]'s army was twice as large, containing over 74,000 men, including [[Holy Roman Empire|German]], [[Croat]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], Hungarian, English, Spanish, [[Czechs|Czech]], Italian, French, [[Burgundians|Burgundian]], [[Danes|Danish]] and Swedish soldiers, along with other Europeans as volunteers, [[artillery]]men, and officers. The Christian forces seized Buda, and in the next few years, all of the former Hungarian lands, except areas near Temesvár ([[Timișoara]]), were taken from the Turks. In the 1699 [[Treaty of Karlowitz]], these territorial changes were officially recognized as the end of the rule of the Turks, and in 1718 the entire [[Kingdom of Hungary]] was removed from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]].

[[File:Jakobey Buda ostroma 2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian revolutionary army]] liberates the Buda castle in May 1849.]]

The 19th century was dominated by the Hungarian struggle for independence<ref name=Encarta /> and modernisation. The national insurrection against the [[Habsburgs]] began in the Hungarian capital [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|in 1848]] and was defeated one and a half years later, with the help of the Russian Empire. 1867 was the year of [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Reconciliation]] that brought about the birth of [[Austria-Hungary]]. This made Budapest the twin capital of a dual monarchy. It was this compromise which opened the second great phase of development in the [[history of Budapest]], lasting until [[World War I]].

The dynamic Pest grew into the country's administrative, political, economic, trade and cultural hub. Ethnic [[Hungarians]] overtook [[Danube Swabians|Germans]] in the second half of the 19th century due to mass migration from the overpopulated rural [[Transdanubia]] and [[Great Hungarian Plain]]. Between 1851 and 1910 the proportion of Hungarians increased from 35.6% to 85.9%, Hungarian became the dominant language, and German was crowded out.

{{anchor|Allied air strikes}}In 1944, a year before the end of [[World War II]], Budapest was partly destroyed by [[Royal Air Force|British]] and [[United States Army Air Forces|American]] air raids (first attack 4 April 1944<ref>{{cite news |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/17889740 |title=RAF raids Budapest – second heavy attack |date=5 April 1944}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/47691625 |title=RAF Follows US Raid on Budapest |date=5 April 1944 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/11807143 |title=Budapest bombed by RAF |date=5 April 1944 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>).
From 24 December 1944 to 13 February 1945, the city was besieged during the [[Battle of Budapest]]. Budapest sustained major damage caused by the attacking Soviet and Romanian troops and the defending [[Wehrmacht|German]] and Hungarian troops. More than 38,000 civilians died during the conflict. [[Bridges of Budapest|All bridges]] were destroyed by the Germans. The stone lions that have decorated the Chain Bridge since 1852 survived the devastation of the war.<ref name=chbridge>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bridgesofbudapest.com/bridge/chain_bridge|title=Chain Bridge / Budapest|website=www.bridgesofbudapest.com|accessdate=1 September 2023}}</ref>

Between 20% and 40% of Greater Budapest's 250,000 Jewish inhabitants died through [[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Arrow Cross Party]], during the [[Operation Panzerfaust|German occupation of Hungary]], from 1944 to early 1945.<ref>{{cite web |title=Budapest |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005264 |access-date=18 July 2007}}</ref> <!-- links to relevant materials in the ''Holocaust Encyclopedia'' on the site of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. -->

Swiss diplomat [[Carl Lutz]] rescued tens of thousands of Jews by issuing Swiss protection papers and designating numerous buildings, including the now famous Glass House (Üvegház) at Vadász Street 29, to be Swiss protected territory. About 3,000 Hungarian Jews found refuge at the Glass House and in a neighboring building. Swedish diplomat [[Raoul Wallenberg]] saved the lives of tens of thousands of Jews in Budapest by giving them Swedish protection papers and taking them under his consular protection.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/wallenberg.html |title=Raoul Wallenberg |encyclopedia=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |access-date=4 December 2014}}</ref> Wallenberg was abducted by the Russians on 17 January 1945 and never regained freedom.

There are two monuments for Wallenberg, one for Carl Lutz and one for Giorgio Perlasca in Budapest.

Following the capture of Hungary from [[Nazi Germany]] by the [[Red Army]], [[Soviet occupation of Hungary|Soviet military occupation]] ensued, which ended only in 1991. The Soviets exerted significant influence on Hungarian political affairs. In 1949, Hungary was declared a [[Communism|communist]] People's Republic ([[People's Republic of Hungary]]). The new Communist government considered the buildings like the [[Buda Castle]] symbols of the former regime, and during the 1950s the palace was gutted and all the interiors were destroyed (also see [[Stalin era]]).
On 23 October 1956 citizens held a large peaceful demonstration in Budapest demanding democratic reform. The demonstrators went to the Budapest radio station and demanded to publish their demands. The regime ordered troops to shoot into the crowd. Hungarian soldiers gave rifles to the demonstrators who were now able to capture the building. This initiated the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]]. The demonstrators demanded to appoint [[Imre Nagy]] to be [[Prime Minister of Hungary]]. To their surprise, the central committee of the "[[Hungarian Working People's Party]]" did so that same evening. This uprising was an anti-Soviet revolt that lasted from 23 October until 11 November. After Nagy had declared that Hungary was to leave the [[Warsaw Pact]] and become neutral, Soviet tanks and troops entered the country to crush the revolt. Fighting continued until mid November, leaving more than 3000 dead. A monument was erected at the fiftieth anniversary of the revolt in 2006, at the edge of the [[City Park (Budapest)|City Park]]. Its shape is a wedge with a 56 angle degree made in rusted iron that gradually becomes shiny, ending in an intersection to symbolize Hungarian forces that temporarily eradicated the Communist leadership.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.shapedscape.com/projects/memorial-to-the-1956-hungarian-revolution-and-war-of-independence |title=Memorial to the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and War of Independence |date=6 July 2017 |publisher=Shapedscape |access-date=6 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729004014/http://www.shapedscape.com/projects/memorial-to-the-1956-hungarian-revolution-and-war-of-independence |archive-date=29 July 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

From the 1960s to the late 1980s Hungary was often satirically referred to as "[[Goulash Communism|the happiest barrack]]" within the [[Eastern bloc]], and much of the wartime damage to the city was finally repaired. Work on [[Erzsébet Bridge]], the last to be rebuilt, was finished in 1964. In the early 1970s, [[Budapest Metro]]'s east–west [[Line 2 (Budapest Metro)|M2 line]] was first opened, followed by the [[Line 3 (Budapest Metro)|M3 line]] in 1976. In 1987, Buda Castle and the banks of the Danube were included in the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Sites]]. [[Andrássy Avenue]] (including the [[Millennium Underground Railway]], [[Hősök tere]], and [[Városliget]]) was added to the UNESCO list in 2002. In the 1980s, the city's population reached 2.1&nbsp;million. In recent times a significant decrease in population occurred mainly due to a massive movement to the neighbouring agglomeration in [[Pest county]], i.e., suburbanisation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/11871881.pdf |title=Suburbanization and Its Consequences in the Budapest Metropolitan Area |date=6 July 2017 |publisher=Tocqueville Research Center |access-date=6 July 2017 |archive-date=10 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110165134/https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/11871881.pdf |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the last decades of the 20th century the political changes of 1989–90 ([[Fall of the Iron Curtain]]) concealed changes in civil society and along the streets of Budapest. The monuments of the dictatorship were removed from public places, into [[Memento Park]]. In the first 20 years of the new democracy, the development of the city was managed by its mayor, [[Gábor Demszky]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://budapest.hu/Lapok/Budapest-kor%C3%A1bbi-polg%C3%A1rmesterei-%C3%A9s-f%C5%91polg%C3%A1rmesterei.aspx |title=Former Mayors of Budapest (Budapest korábbi polgármesterei és főpolgármesterei) |date=6 July 2017 |publisher=Government of Budapest}}</ref>

In October 2019, opposition candidate [[Gergely Karácsony]] won the Budapest mayoral [[2019 Budapest mayoral election|election]], meaning the first electoral blow for Hungary's nationalist prime minister [[Viktor Orbán]] since coming to power in 2010.<ref>{{cite news |agency=Agence France-Presse |title=Blow for Hungary PM Orbán as opposition wins Budapest mayoral race |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/13/opposition-parties-candidate-wins-budapest-mayoral-race |work=The Guardian |date=14 October 2019}}</ref>

[[File:Budapest by Sentinel-2, 2020-07-28.jpg|left|thumb|[[Satellite imagery]] of Budapest]]

Budapest, strategically placed at the centre of the [[Pannonian Basin]], lies on an ancient route linking the hills of Transdanubia with the Great Plain. By road it is {{convert|216|km}} south-east of [[Vienna]], {{convert|545|km}} south of [[Warsaw]], {{convert|1565|km}} south-west of Moscow, {{convert|1122|km}} north of [[Athens]], {{convert|1235|km|}} north-east of [[Rome]], {{convert|788|km}} north-east of [[Milan]], {{convert|443|km}} south-east of [[Prague]], {{convert|343|km}} north-east of [[Zagreb]], {{convert|748|km}} north-east of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] and {{convert|1329|km}} north-west of [[Istanbul]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Budapest |url=https://www.google.hu/maps/place/Budapest/@47.4812134,19.1303031,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4741c334d1d4cfc9:0x400c4290c1e1160 |publisher=Google Maps |access-date=4 December 2014}}</ref>

The {{convert|525|sqkm|sqmi}} area of Budapest lies in [[Central Hungary]], surrounded by settlements of the agglomeration in Pest county. The capital extends {{convert|25|and|29|km|0|abbr=on}} in the north–south, east–west direction respectively. The Danube enters the city from the north; later it encircles two islands, [[Óbuda Island]] and [[Margaret Island]].<ref name=Encarta /> The third island [[Csepel Island]] is the largest of the Budapest Danube islands, however only its northernmost tip is within city limits. The river that separates the two parts of the city is {{convert|230|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide at its narrowest point in Budapest. Pest lies on the flat terrain of the Great Plain while Buda is rather hilly.<ref name=Encarta />

The wide Danube was always fordable at this point because of a small number of islands in the middle of the river. The city has marked topographical contrasts: Buda is built on the higher river terraces and hills of the western side, while the considerably larger Pest spreads out on a flat and featureless sand plain on the river's opposite bank.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Budapest#toc59294 |title=Budapest |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=21 November 2013 |first=Laszlo |last=Péter |access-date=4 December 2014}}</ref> Pest's terrain rises with a slight eastward gradient, so the easternmost parts of the city lie at the same altitude as Buda's smallest hills, notably [[Gellért Hill]] and Castle Hill.<ref name="budapest.com">{{cite web |title=General information – Geography |url=https://www.budapest.com/city_guide/general_information/geography_of_budapest.en.html |publisher=Budapest.com |access-date=6 July 2017}}</ref>

The Buda hills consist mainly of limestone and dolomite, the water created [[speleothem]]s, the most famous ones being the Pálvölgyi cave (total length {{convert|7200|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and the Szemlőhegyi cave (total length {{convert|2200|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}). The hills were formed in the Triassic Period. The highest point of the hills and of Budapest is [[János Hill]], at {{convert|527|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]]. The lowest point is the line of the Danube which is {{convert|96|m|abbr=off}} above sea level. Budapest is also rich in green areas. Of the {{convert|525|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}} occupied by the city, {{convert|83|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}} is green area, park and forest.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.budapest-tourist.info/en/geography.php |title=Geography of Budapest |publisher=Budapest Tourist Info |access-date=4 December 2014}}</ref> The forests of [[Buda hills]] are environmentally protected.<ref>{{cite web |title=Protected Landscape Area of Buda |url=https://www.dunaipoly.hu/en/places/protected-areas/protected-areas-1/protected-landscape-area-of-buda |publisher=Duna-Ipoly National Park Directorate |access-date=6 July 2017}}</ref>

The city's importance in terms of traffic is very central, because many major [[European roads]] and [[Rail transport in Europe|European railway]] lines lead to Budapest.<ref name="budapest.com" /> The Danube was and is still an important water-way and this region in the centre of the Carpathian Basin lies at the cross-roads of [[trade route]]s.<ref name="budpocketguide.com">{{cite web |title=Geography of Budapest |url=http://www.budpocketguide.com/TouristInfo/Geography_of_Bp.php |access-date=4 December 2014 |publisher=Budapest Pocket Guide |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214061157/http://www.budpocketguide.com/TouristInfo/Geography_of_Bp.php |archive-date=14 February 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
Budapest is one of only three capital cities in the world which has [[Hot spring|thermal springs]] (the others being [[Reykjavík]] in [[Iceland]] and [[Sofia]] in [[Bulgaria]]). Some 125 springs produce {{convert|70|e6l|abbr=off}} of thermal water a day, with temperatures ranging up to 58 Celsius. Some of these waters have been claimed to have medicinal effects due to their high mineral contents.<ref name="budapest.com" />

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of Budapest}}

Budapest has a transitional climate between a [[humid temperate climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''[[Humid subtropical climate|Cfa]]'', [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''[[Oceanic climate|Doak]]''), and a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dfa'', [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Dcao''), with warm to hot summers and chilly winters.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Table 1 Overview of the Köppen-Geiger climate classes including the defining criteria. |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02549-6/tables/1 |journal=Nature: Scientific Data |language=en}}</ref> Winter (November until early March) can be cold and the city receives little sunshine. Snowfall is fairly frequent in most years, and nighttime temperatures of {{convert|-10|C|F|}} are not uncommon between mid-December and mid-February. The spring months (March and April) see variable conditions, with a rapid increase in the average temperature. The weather in late March and in April is often very agreeable during the day and fresh at night. Budapest's long summer – lasting from May until mid-September – is warm or very warm. Sudden heavy showers also occur, particularly in May and June. The autumn in Budapest (mid-September until late October) is characterised by little rain and long sunny days with moderate temperatures. Temperatures often turn abruptly colder in late October or early November.

Mean annual precipitation in Budapest is around {{convert|23.5|in|1|abbr=out}}. On average, there are 84 days with precipitation and 1988 hours of sunshine (of a possible 4383) each year.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Budapest |title=Budapest |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=11 September 2014 |access-date=11 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Climate Budapest – Hungary |url=https://www.climatedata.eu/climate.php?loc=huxx0002&lang=en |publisher=Climatedata.eu |access-date=4 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503161858/http://www.climatedata.eu/climate.php?loc=huxx0002&lang=en |archive-date=3 May 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sunshine & Daylight Hours in Budapest, Hungary |url=https://www.budapest.climatemps.com/sunlight.php |publisher=climatemps.com |access-date=4 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222072343/http://www.budapest.climatemps.com/sunlight.php |archive-date=22 February 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> From March to October, average sunshine totals are roughly equal to those seen in northern Italy ([[Venice]]).

The city lies on the boundary between Zone 6 and Zone 7 in terms of the [[hardiness zone]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gardenology.org/wiki/Hardiness_zone |title=Hardiness zone – Gardenology.org – Plant Encyclopedia and Gardening wiki |publisher=Gardenology.org |access-date=13 October 2012 |archive-date=3 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003124820/http://www.gardenology.org/wiki/Hardiness_zone |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.backyardgardener.com/garden-forum-education/hardiness-zones/europa-hardiness-zone-map/ |title=Europa Hardiness zone map |publisher=Backyardgardener.com |access-date=13 October 2012}}</ref>

Budapest has architecturally noteworthy buildings in a wide range of styles and from distinct time periods, from the ancient times as Roman City of Aquincum in Óbuda (District III), which dates to around 89 AD, to the most modern [[Palace of Arts (Budapest)|Palace of Arts]], the contemporary arts museum and concert hall.<ref name="Budapest Architecture">{{cite web |url=http://visitbudapest.travel/guide/budapest-architecture/ |title=Budapest Architecture |publisher=visitbudapest.travel |year=2013 |access-date=5 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530170324/http://visitbudapest.travel/guide/budapest-architecture/ |archive-date=30 May 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbase.com/helenpb/the_incredible_architecture_of_budapest |title=The Incredible Architecture of Budapest |publisher=pbase.com |year=2013 |access-date=5 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.budapest.com/city_guide/attractions/exceptional_buildings.en.html |title=Exceptional Buildings Budapest |publisher=budapest.com |year=2014 |access-date=5 May 2014 |archive-date=25 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425000115/http://www.budapest.com/city_guide/attractions/exceptional_buildings.en.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Most buildings in Budapest are relatively low: in the early 2010s there were around 100 buildings higher than {{convert|45|m}}. The number of high-rise buildings is kept low by building legislation, which is aimed at preserving the historic cityscape and to meet the requirements of the [[World Heritage Site]]. Strong rules apply to the planning, authorisation and construction of high-rise buildings and consequently much of the [[inner city]] does not have any. Some planners would like see an easing of the rules for the construction of skyscrapers, and the possibility of building skyscrapers outside the city's historic core has been raised.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prestigecity.hu/towers/en/lakasok/magas |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016232556/http://www.prestigecity.hu/towers/en/lakasok/magas |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 October 2007 |title=The high-rise buildings as emblematique element of luxury district, 13th District of Budapest |publisher=Prestigecity |access-date=5 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euscreen.eu/play.jsp?id=EUS_D1935399A8EF4E8891F15BA4C0800C86 |title=The coming of skyscrapers? |publisher=euscreen.eu |date=17 December 2006 |access-date=5 May 2014 |archive-date=14 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514015754/http://www.euscreen.eu/play.jsp?id=EUS_D1935399A8EF4E8891F15BA4C0800C86 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In the chronological order of architectural styles Budapest is represented on the entire timeline, starting with the Roman City of Aquincum representing [[History of architecture|ancient architecture]].

The next determinative style is the [[Gothic architecture]] in Budapest. The few remaining Gothic buildings can be found in the Castle District. Buildings of note are no. 18, 20 and 22 on Országház Street, which date back to the 14th century and No. 31 Úri Street, which has a Gothic façade that dates back to the 15th century. Other buildings with Gothic features are the [[Inner City Parish Church in Pest|Inner City Parish Church]], built in the 12th century,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://visitbudapest.travel/local-secrets/inner-city-parish-church/ |title=The oldest church in Pest |publisher=visitbudapest.travel |year=2011 |access-date=5 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506000001/http://visitbudapest.travel/local-secrets/inner-city-parish-church/ |archive-date=6 May 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and the Mary Magdalene Church, completed in the 15th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://budavar.btk.mta.hu/en/streets-squares-buildings/kapisztran-square/251-magdalene-tower.html |title=Kapisztrán tér – Parish Church of Saint Maria Magdalene, Magdalene Tower |author=András Végh |website=Hungarian Academy of Sciences-BTM website |access-date=6 September 2019 |archive-date=12 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220212163238/http://budavar.btk.mta.hu/en/streets-squares-buildings/kapisztran-square/251-magdalene-tower.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> The most characteristic Gothic-style buildings are actually [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]], like the most well-known Budapest landmarks, the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]]<ref name=Steves>{{cite book |first1=Rick |last1=Steves |first2=Cameron |last2=Hewitt |title=Rick Steves' Budapest |date=2009 |publisher=Avalon Travel Publishing |isbn=978-1-59880-217-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781598802177}}</ref> and the [[Matthias Church]], where much of the original material was used (originally built in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]] in 1015).<ref name="budapestbylocals.com">{{cite web |url=https://www.budapestbylocals.com/matthias-church.html |title=Matthias Church Budapest Castle-Church of Our Lady Buda, Tickets, Concerts |date=9 July 2022 |publisher=Budapestbylocals.com}}</ref>

The next chapter in the history of human architecture is [[Renaissance architecture]]. One of the earliest places to be influenced by the Renaissance style of architecture was Hungary, and Budapest in particular. The style appeared following the marriage of King [[Matthias Corvinus]] and [[Beatrice of Naples]] in 1476. Many Italian artists, craftsmen and masons came to Buda with the new queen. Today, many of the original renaissance buildings disappeared during the varied history of Buda, but Budapest is still rich in renaissance and neo-renaissance buildings, like the famous [[Hungarian State Opera House]], [[St. Stephen's Basilica]] and the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lovelybudapest.com/en/about-budapest/budapest-attractions/the-basilica-of-st-stephen.html |title=The Basilica of Saint Stephen |publisher=Lovelybudapest.com |access-date=14 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171211222120/http://www.lovelybudapest.com/en/about-budapest/budapest-attractions/the-basilica-of-st-stephen.html |archive-date=11 December 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

During the Turkish occupation (1541–1686), Islamic culture flourished in Budapest; multiple mosques and baths were built in the city. These were great examples of [[Ottoman architecture]], which was influenced by Muslims from around the world including Turkish, Iranian, Arabian and to a larger extent, [[Byzantine architecture]] as well as Islamic traditions. After the Holy League conquered Budapest, they replaced most of the mosques with churches and minarets were turned into bell towers and cathedral spires. At one point the distinct sloping central square in Budapest became a bustling Oriental bazaar, which was filled with "the chatter of camel caravans on their way to Yemen and India".<ref name=NYT1991>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/10/travel/glimpsing-hungary-s-ottoman-past.html |title=Glimpsing Hungary's Ottoman Past |author=Celestine Bohlen |date=10 March 1991 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |access-date=9 November 2016}}</ref> Budapest is in fact one of the few places in the world with functioning original [[Turkish bath]]houses dating back to the 16th century, like Rudas Baths or [[Király Baths]]. Budapest is home to the northernmost place where the [[Tomb of Gül Baba|tomb]] of influential Islamic Turkish Sufi Dervish, [[Gül Baba]] is found. Various cultures converged in Hungary seemed to coalesce well with each other, as if all these different cultures and architecture styles are digested into Hungary's own way of cultural blend. A precedent to show the city's self-conscious is the top section of the city's main square, named as [[Széchenyi square (Pécs)|Szechenyi]]. When Turks came to the city, they built mosques here which was aggressively replaced with Gothic church of St. Bertalan. The rationale of reusing the base of the former Islamic building mosque and reconstruction into Gothic Church but Islamic style architecture over it is typically Islamic are still visible. An official term for the rationale is [[spolia]]. The mosque was called the djami of Pasha Gazi Kassim, and djami means mosque in Arabic. After Turks and Muslims were expelled and massacred from Budapest, the site was reoccupied by Christians and reformed into a church, the [[Inner City Parish Church in Pest|Inner City Parish Church (Budapest)]]. The [[minaret]] and Turkish entranceway were removed. The shape of the architecture is its only hint of exotic past—"two surviving prayer niches facing Mecca and an ecumenical symbol atop its cupola: a cross rising above the Turkish crescent moon".<ref name=NYT1991/>

After 1686, the [[Baroque architecture]] designated the dominant style of art in catholic countries from the 17th century to the 18th century.<ref name="auto">{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/400 |title=Budapest, including the Banks of the Danube, the Buda Castle Quarter and Andrássy Avenue – UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=UNESCO |access-date=16 April 2012}}</ref> There are many Baroque-style buildings in Budapest and one of the finest examples of preserved Baroque-style architecture is the Church of St. Anna in [[Batthyány tér|Batthyhány square]]. An interesting part of Budapest is the less touristy Óbuda, the main square of which also has some beautiful preserved historic buildings with Baroque façades. The Castle District is another place to visit where the best-known landmark Buda Royal Palace and many other buildings were built in the Baroque style.<ref name="auto" />

The [[Classical architecture]] and [[Neoclassical architecture]] are the next in the timeline. Budapest had not one but two architects that were masters of the Classicist style. [[Mihály Pollack]] (1773–1855) and [[József Hild]] (1789–1867), built many beautiful Classicist-style buildings in the city. Some of the best examples are the [[Hungarian National Museum]], the [[Lutheran Church of Budavár]] (both designed by Pollack) and the seat of the [[List of heads of state of Hungary|Hungarian president]], the [[Sándor Palace, Budapest|Sándor Palace]]. The most iconic and widely known Classicist-style attraction in Budapest is the [[Széchenyi Chain Bridge]].<ref name=structurae>{{Structurae|id=20000455|title=Széchenyi Chain Bridge}}</ref> Budapest's two most beautiful [[Gothic Revival architecture#Romanticism and nationalism|Romantic architecture]] buildings are the [[Dohány Street Synagogue|Great Synagogue]] in Dohány Street and the [[Vigadó Concert Hall]] on the [[Danube Promenade]], both designed by architect [[Frigyes Feszl]] (1821–1884). Another noteworthy structure is the [[Budapest-Nyugati Railway Terminal|Budapest Western Railway Station]], which was designed by August de Serres and built by the [[Eiffel (company)|Eiffel Company]] of Paris in 1877.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://welovebudapest.com/en/venue/nyugati-railway-station-2/ |title=Nyugati Railway Station – WeLoveBudapest EN |publisher=Welovebudapest.com |access-date=14 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215083707/https://welovebudapest.com/en/venue/nyugati-railway-station-2/ |archive-date=15 February 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:Exterior view - daytime.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|The [[Hungarian Parliament Building|Hungarian Parliament]], completed in 1904]]

[[Art Nouveau]] came into fashion in Budapest by the exhibitions which were held in and around 1896 and organised in connection with the Hungarian [[Millennium]] celebrations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boedapestrondleiding.com/text/rondleidingen/artnouveaurondleiding_en.php |title=Budapest Tour: Early Art Nouveau 1897–1904 |publisher=budapestarchitect.com |year=2011 |access-date=5 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529120059/http://www.boedapestrondleiding.com/text/rondleidingen/artnouveaurondleiding_en.php |archive-date=29 May 2014}}</ref> Art Nouveau in Hungary (''Szecesszió'' in Hungarian) is a blend of several architectural styles, with a focus on Hungary's specialities. One of the leading Art Nouveau architects, [[Ödön Lechner]] (1845–1914), was inspired by Indian and Syrian architecture as well as traditional Hungarian decorative designs. One of his most beautiful buildings in Budapest is the [[Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Applied Arts]]. Another examples for Art Nouveau in Budapest is the [[Gresham Palace]] in front of the Chain Bridge, the [[Hotel Gellért]], the [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music]] or [[Budapest Zoo and Botanical Garden]].<ref name="Budapest Architecture" />

The second half of the 20th century also saw, under the communist regime, the construction of [[blocks of flats]] ([[panelház]]), as in other Eastern European countries. In the 21st century, Budapest faces new challenges in its architecture. The pressure towards the high-rise buildings is unequivocal among today's world cities, but preserving Budapest's unique cityscape and its very diverse architecture, along with green areas, forces Budapest to balance between them. The [[Contemporary architecture]] has wide margin in the city. [[Public space]]s attract heavy investment by business and government also, so that the city has gained entirely new (or renovated and redesigned) squares, parks and monuments, for example the city central [[Kossuth Lajos tér, Budapest|Kossuth Lajos square]], [[Deák Ferenc tér|Deák Ferenc square]] and [[Liberty Square (Budapest)|Liberty Square]]. Numerous landmarks have been created in the last decade in Budapest, like the [[National Theatre (Budapest)|National Theatre]], Palace of Arts, [[Rákóczi Bridge]], [[Megyeri Bridge]], [[Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport#Sky Court between Terminal 2A and 2B|Budapest Airport Sky Court]] among others, and millions of square meters of new [[office buildings]] and [[residential area|apartments]]. But there are still large opportunities in [[real estate development]] in the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.joneslanglasalle.eu/ResearchLevel1/Budapest%20high%20streets%20_%20electronic%20version.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.joneslanglasalle.eu/ResearchLevel1/Budapest%20high%20streets%20_%20electronic%20version.pdf |archive-date=9 October 2022 |url-status=live |title=Budapest High Street Overview 2013 |publisher=[[Jones Lang LaSalle]] |date=October 2013 |access-date=5 May 2014}}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/asset-management/emerging-trends-real-estate/assets/pwc-emerging-trends-in-real-estate-2013-europe.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/asset-management/emerging-trends-real-estate/assets/pwc-emerging-trends-in-real-estate-2013-europe.pdf |archive-date=9 October 2022 |url-status=live |title=Emerging Trends in Real Estate, 2013 Europe |publisher=[[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] |year=2013 |access-date=5 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbre.hu/hu_en/news_events/news_detail?p_id=16464 |title=Bulls return to the European commercial real estate market (Budapest) |publisher=[[CBRE Group]] |date=24 March 2014 |access-date=5 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505234228/http://www.cbre.hu/hu_en/news_events/news_detail?p_id=16464 |archive-date=5 May 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Contemporary Budapest is divided into 23 districts ({{langx|hu|link=no|kerületek}}, {{singular}}: ''kerület''), each with a mayor and municipal government elected separately from the general municipal government. The districts and the general municipal government have [[Constitution of Hungary|constitutionally]] and legally defined, non-overlapping areas of competence. Each district has a municipally recognized name, some of which correspond to how locals call that area or neighborhood (e.g., [[Inner City (Budapest)|Belváros]], V. district; [[Terézváros]], VI. district), others which (e.g., [[Újbuda]], XI. district) are neologisms. Street signs display the district and that neighborhood's colloquial name. The latter are often the names of villages that were gradually annexed to the city (e.g., [[Sashalom]], [[Budafok]]) or of superseded administrative units of former boroughs.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.frommers.com/destinations/budapest/neighborhoods-in-brief#sthash.WyAc5THZ.dpbs |publisher=Frommer's Budapest |title=Neighborhoods in Brief |year=2011 |access-date=5 May 2014}}</ref> 

After the unification of Buda, Pest, and Óbuda in 1873, Budapest initially had 10 districts. It was during the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|interwar period]] that [[:hu:Szendy Károly|Károly Szendy]]'s 1934-1944 mayoral administration first seriously considered annexing peripheral towns and villages. This only came about, however, after the rise of [[Hungarian People's Republic|state communism in Hungary]]. In 1950, for reasons of social and industrial policy—including the [[Hungarian Working People's Party]]'s desire to [[proletarianization|proletarianize]] the traditionally right-wing suburbs—7 [[city with county rights|cities with county rights]] and 16 towns were annexed to the capital to form contemporary [[Greater Budapest]] ({{langx|hu|link=no|Nagy-Budapest}}).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sipos |first1=András |title=Nagy-Budapest létrehozásától Nagy-Budapest revíziójáig (1949–1956) |journal=Múltunk |date=2009 |volume=3 |pages=4–31 |url=https://www.multunk.hu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/siposa09-3.pdf |access-date=15 August 2024}}</ref> This reorganized the city into 22 districts, a number that grew to 23 after [[Soroksár]] seceded from [[Pesterzsébet]] in 1994. The contemporary city thus consists of 6 districts in Buda, 16 in Pest, and [[Csepel]]. Today, districts I., II., XI., and XII. in Buda and V., VI., VII., VIII., and IX. in Pest make up the city center in its broadest sense, corresponding roughly to the 1873 municipal boundaries.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.urbandivercities.eu/budapest/ |title=Urbandivercities.eu, Case study Budapest and Budapest's 8th district |year=2013 |access-date=5 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505231945/http://www.urbandivercities.eu/budapest/ |archive-date=5 May 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://geogr.elte.hu/TGF/TGF_Doktorik/eberenyitezisangol.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://geogr.elte.hu/TGF/TGF_Doktorik/eberenyitezisangol.pdf |archive-date=9 October 2022 |url-status=live |first=Eszter B. |last=Berényi |location=Budapest |title=The transformation of historical city districts in inner city of Budapest (PhD dissertation) |year=2010 |access-date=5 May 2014}}</ref>

Budapest's districts are numbered according to three concentric semicircles. The I. district is a small area in central Buda, including the [[Castle Quarter (Budapest)|Castle Quarter]]. District II. is in Buda to the castle's northwest while district III. stretches along the northernmost part of Buda and includes the former Óbuda. District IV. continues this semicircle in northernmost Pest, but the V. district is in the very center of Pest and inaugurates a new circle that then loops back through Pest to Buda as the VI., VII., VIII., IX., XI., and XII. districts. Districts XIII., XIV., XV., XVI., XVII., XVIII., XIX., XX., XXI., and XXII. form yet another semicircle in outermost Pest. Districts X. and XXIII. form irregularities within the overall pattern.<ref>{{citation |url=http://epa.oszk.hu/02100/02120/00030/pdf/ORSZ_BPTM_TBM_30_337.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://epa.oszk.hu/02100/02120/00030/pdf/ORSZ_BPTM_TBM_30_337.pdf |archive-date=9 October 2022 |url-status=live |location=Budapest |title=After a local referendum, Soroksár became an independent district.

== Main sights and tourism ==
{{See also|List of sights and historic places in Budapest|List of tourist attractions in Budapest}}
[[File:St Stephen's Basilica (27184201240).jpg|thumb|[[St. Stephen's Basilica]]]]
Budapest is widely known for its well-kept pre-war cityscape, with a great variety of streets and landmarks in [[classical architecture]].

The most well-known sight of the capital is the [[neo-Gothic]] [[Hungarian Parliament Building|Parliament]], the biggest building in Hungary with its {{convert|268|m|ft}} length, also holding (since 2001) the [[Holy Crown of Hungary|Hungarian Crown Jewels]].

[[Saint Stephen's Basilica]] is the most important religious building of the city, where the [[Holy Right Hand]] of Hungary's first king, [[Stephen I of Hungary|Saint Stephen]] is on display as well.

The [[Hungarian cuisine]] and café culture can be seen and tasted in a lot of places, like [[Café Gerbeaud|Gerbeaud Café]], the ''Százéves'', ''Biarritz'', ''Fortuna'', ''Alabárdos'', ''Arany Szarvas'', ''[[Gundel]]'' and the world-famous Mátyás-pince restaurants and beer bars.

There are Roman remains at the [[Aquincum Museum]], and historic furniture at the [[Nagytétény Castle Museum]], just 2 out of 223 museums in Budapest. Another historical museum is the [[House of Terror]], hosted in the building that was the venue of the [[Nazi Headquarters]]. The Castle Hill, the River Danube embankments and the whole of Andrássy út have been officially recognized as [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]].

Castle Hill and the [[Castle District, Buda|Castle District]]; there are three churches here, six museums, and a host of interesting buildings, streets and squares. The former Royal Palace is one of the symbols of Hungary – and has been the scene of battles and wars ever since the 13th century. Nowadays it houses two museums and the [[National Széchenyi Library]]. The nearby Sándor Palace contains the offices and official residence of the [[President of Hungary]]. The seven-hundred-year-old Matthias Church is one of the jewels of Budapest, it is in neo-Gothic style, decorated with coloured shingles and elegant pinnacles. Next to it is an equestrian statue of the first king of Hungary, King Saint Stephen, and behind that is the [[Fisherman's Bastion]], built in 1905 by the architect [[Frigyes Schulek]], the Fishermen's Bastions owes its name to the namesake corporation that during the [[Middle Ages]] was responsible of the defence of this part of ramparts, from where opens out a panoramic view of the whole city. Statues of the [[Turul]], the mythical guardian bird of Hungary, can be found in both the Castle District and the [[Hegyvidék|Twelfth District]].

In Pest, arguably the most important sight is Andrássy út. This Avenue is an elegant {{convert|2.5|km|0|abbr=off}} long tree-lined street that covers the distance from Deák Ferenc tér to the Heroes Square. This Avenue overlooks many important sites. It is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. As far as [[Kodály körönd]] and [[Oktogon (intersection)|Oktogon]] both sides are lined with large shops and flats built close together. Between there and Heroes' Square the houses are detached and altogether grander. Under the whole runs continental Europe's oldest Underground railway, most of whose stations retain their original appearance. Heroes' Square is dominated by the [[Hősök tere#Millenary Monument|Millenary Monument]], with the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] in front. To the sides are the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] and the [[Kunsthalle Budapest]], and behind City Park opens out, with [[Vajdahunyad Castle]]. One of the jewels of Andrássy út is the Hungarian State Opera House. [[Statue Park]], a theme park with striking statues of the [[Communist era]], is located just outside the main city and is accessible by public transport.

The Dohány Street Synagogue is the largest synagogue in Europe, and the second largest active synagogue in the world.<ref>{{cite news |title=Out of Darkness, New Life |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/travel/30dayout.html |date=30 December 2007 |access-date=12 March 2008 |first=Nicholas |last=Kulish}}</ref> The synagogue is located in the Jewish district taking up several blocks in central Budapest bordered by Király utca, Wesselényi utca, [[Grand Boulevard (Budapest)|Grand Boulevard]] and Bajcsy Zsilinszky road. It was built in moorish revival style in 1859 and has a [[seating capacity]] of 3,000. Adjacent to it is a sculpture reproducing a weeping willow tree in steel to commemorate the Hungarian victims of the [[The Holocaust in Hungary|Holocaust]].

The city is also home to the largest medicinal [[Roman baths|bath]] in Europe ([[Széchenyi Medicinal Bath]]) and the third largest Parliament building in the world, once the largest in the world. Other attractions are the [[Bridges of Budapest|bridges of the capital]]. Seven bridges provide crossings over the Danube, and from north to south are: the [[Árpád Bridge]] (built in 1950 at the north of Margaret Island); the [[Margaret Bridge]] (built in 1901, destroyed during the war by an explosion and then rebuilt in 1948); the Chain Bridge (built in 1849, destroyed during [[World War II]] and then rebuilt in 1949); the [[Elisabeth Bridge]] (completed in 1903 and dedicated to the murdered [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|Queen Elisabeth]], it was destroyed by the Germans during the war and replaced with a new bridge in 1964); the [[Liberty Bridge (Budapest)|Liberty Bridge]] (opened in 1896 and rebuilt in 1989 in Art Nouveau style); the [[Petőfi Bridge]] (completed in 1937, destroyed during the war and rebuilt in 1952); the Rákóczi Bridge (completed in 1995).

Budapest has many [[municipal parks]] and most have playgrounds for children and seasonal activities like skating in the winter and boating in the summer. Access from the city center is quick and easy with the [[Line 1 (Budapest Metro)|Millennium Underground]]. Budapest has a complex park system, with various lands operated by the Budapest City Gardening Ltd.<ref name=parks>{{cite web |title=Parks |url=https://www.budapest.com/city_guide/attractions/parks.en.html |publisher=Budapest.com |access-date=4 December 2014 |archive-date=23 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223120204/http://www.budapest.com/city_guide/attractions/parks.en.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>
The wealth of greenspace afforded by Budapest's parks is further augmented by a network of open spaces containing forest, streams, and lakes that are set aside as natural areas which lie not far from the inner city, including the Budapest Zoo and Botanical Garden (established in 1866) in the City Park.<ref>{{cite web |title=Budapest Parks & Caves |url=http://visitbudapest.travel/guide/budapest-parks-caves/ |publisher=visitBudapest.travel |access-date=4 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203041405/http://visitbudapest.travel/guide/budapest-parks-caves/ |archive-date=3 December 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

A number of islands can be found on the Danube in Budapest:

* [[Margaret Island]] ({{langx|hu|Margit-sziget}} {{IPA-hu|ˈmɒrɡit.siɡɛt|}}) is a {{convert|2.5|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} long island and {{convert|0.965|km2|acre}} in area. The island mostly consists of a park and is a popular recreational area for tourists and locals alike. The island lies between Margaret Bridge (south) and Árpád Bridge (north). Dance clubs, swimming pools, an [[Water park|aqua park]], athletic and fitness centres, bicycle and running tracks can be found around the Island. During the day the island is occupied by people doing sports, or just resting.
* [[Csepel Island]] ({{langx|hu|Csepel-sziget}} {{IPA-hu|ˈt͡ʃɛpɛlsiɡɛt|}}) is the largest island of the River Danube in Hungary. It is {{convert|48|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long; its width is {{convert|6|to|8|km|0|abbr=on}} and its area comprises {{convert|257|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. However, only the northern tip of the island is inside the city limits.
* [[Hajógyári Island]] ({{langx|hu|Hajógyári-sziget}} {{IPA-hu|ˈhɒjoːɟaːrisiɡɛt|}}), also known as Óbuda Island ({{langx|hu|Óbudai-sziget}}), is a human-made island located in the third district. This island hosts many activities such as: wake-boarding, jet-skiing during the day, and [[Nightclub|dance clubs]] during the night. This is the island where the famous [[Sziget Festival]] takes place, hosting hundreds of performances per year. Around 400,000 visitors attended the last festival. Many building projects are taking place to make this island into one of the biggest entertainment centres of Europe. The plan is to build [[apartment building]]s, hotels, casinos and a marina.
* {{ill|Molnár Island|hu|Molnár-sziget}} ({{langx|hu|Molnár-sziget}}) is an island in the channel of the Danube that separates Csepel Island from the east bank of the river.

The islands of {{ill|Palotai Island|hu|Palotai-sziget}}, {{ill|Nép Island|hu|Népsziget}}, and {{ill|Háros Island|hu|Háros-sziget}} also formerly existed within the city, but have been joined to the mainland.

The {{ill|Ínség Rock|hu|Ínség-szikla}} ({{langx|hu|Ínség-szikla}}) is a [[reef]] in the Danube close to the shore under the [[Gellért Hill]]. It is only exposed during drought periods when the river level is very low.

Just outside the city boundary to the north lies the large [[Szentendre Island]] ({{langx|hu|Szentendrei-sziget}}) and the much smaller [[Lupa Island (Hungary)|Lupa Island]] ({{langx|hu|Lupa-sziget}}).

One of the reasons the Romans first colonised the area immediately to the west of the River Danube and established their regional capital at Aquincum (now part of Óbuda, in northern Budapest) is so that they could use and enjoy the thermal springs. There are still ruins visible today of the enormous baths that were built during that period. The new baths that were constructed during the Turkish period (1541–1686) served both bathing and medicinal purposes, and some of these are still in use to this day.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mini guide to Budapest's spas |url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20130415-mini-guide-to-budapest-spas |access-date=25 December 2017 |publisher=BBC |date=26 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Fallon |first1=Steve |title=A guide to Budapest's thermal baths |url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/hungary/budapest/travel-tips-and-articles/a-guide-to-budapests-thermal-baths/40625c8c-8a11-5710-a052-1479d2760252 |publisher=Lonely Planet |access-date=25 December 2017}}</ref>

Budapest gained its reputation as a city of [[Spas in Budapest|spas]] in the 1920s, following the first realisation of the economic potential of the thermal waters in drawing in visitors. Indeed, in 1934 Budapest was officially ranked as a "City of Spas". Today, the baths are mostly frequented by the older generation, as, with the exception of the "Magic Bath" and "Cinetrip" water discos, young people tend to prefer the lidos which are open in the summer.

Construction of the Király Baths started in 1565, and most of the present-day building dates from the Turkish period, including most notably the fine cupola-topped pool.

The [[Rudas Baths]] are centrally placed – in the narrow strip of land between Gellért Hill and the River Danube – and also an outstanding example of architecture dating from the Turkish period. The central feature is an octagonal pool over which light shines from a {{convert|10|m|ft}} diameter cupola, supported by eight pillars.

The [[Gellért Baths]] and Hotel were built in 1918, although there had once been Turkish baths on the site, and in the Middle Ages a hospital. In 1927, the Baths were extended to include the wave pool, and the effervescent bath was added in 1934. The well-preserved Art Nouveau interior includes colourful mosaics, marble columns, stained glass windows and statues.

The [[Lukács Baths]] are also in Buda and are also Turkish in origin, although they were only revived at the end of the 19th century. This was also when the spa and treatment centre were founded. There is still something of an atmosphere of fin-de-siècle about the place, and all around the inner courtyard there are marble tablets recalling the thanks of patrons who were cured there. Since the 1950s it has been regarded as a centre for intellectuals and artists.

The [[Széchenyi Baths]] are one of the largest bathing complexes in all Europe, and the only "old" medicinal baths to be found in the Pest side of the city. The indoor medicinal baths date from 1913 and the outdoor pools from 1927. There is an atmosphere of grandeur about the whole place with the bright, largest pools resembling aspects associated with Roman baths, the smaller bath tubs reminding one of the bathing culture of the Greeks, and the saunas and diving pools borrowed from traditions emanating in northern Europe. The three outdoor pools (one of which is a fun pool) are open all year, including winter. Indoors there are over ten separate pools, and a whole host of medical treatments is also available. The Szécheny Baths are built in modern Renaissance style.

Budapest is served by [[Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport]] (BUD) (named after [[Franz Liszt]], the notable Hungarian composer), one of the busiest airports in [[Central and Eastern Europe]], located {{convert|16|km|mi}} east-southeast of the centre of Budapest, in the [[Pestszentlőrinc-Pestszentimre|District XVIII]]. The airport offers international connections among all major European cities, and also to North America, Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
As Hungary's busiest airport, it handles nearly all of the country's air passenger traffic. Budapest Liszt Ferenc handled around 250 [[Airline|scheduled flights]] daily in 2013, and an ever-rising number of [[Air charter|charters]]. London, [[Brussels]], Frankfurt, [[Munich]], Paris, and [[Amsterdam]] are the busiest international connections respectively, while [[Toronto]], Montreal, [[Dubai]], [[Doha]] and [[Alicante]] are the most unusual in the region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://canadianaviationnews.wordpress.com/2014/10/15/air-transat-unveils-its-new-europe-program-for-2015/ |title=Air Transat unveils its new Europe program for 2015 |date=15 October 2014 |access-date=15 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017125912/http://canadianaviationnews.wordpress.com/2014/10/15/air-transat-unveils-its-new-europe-program-for-2015/ |archive-date=17 October 2014}}</ref>

=== Cuisine ===
{{Further|Hungarian cuisine}}

In the modern age, Budapest developed its own peculiar cuisine, based on products of the nearby region, such as lamb, pork and vegetables special to the region. Modern Hungarian cuisine is a synthesis of ancient Asiatic components mixed with French, Germanic, Italian, and Slavic elements. The food of Hungary can be considered a melting pot of the continent, with a culinary base formed from its own, original [[Magyar tribes|Magyar]] cuisine. Considerable numbers of [[Saxons]], Armenians, Italians, Jews and Serbs settled in the Hungarian basin and in Transylvania, also contributing with different new dishes. Elements of ancient Turkish cuisine were adopted during the Ottoman era, in the form of sweets (for example different [[nougat]]s, like white nougat called ''törökméz''), [[quince]] (''birsalma''), [[Turkish delight]], [[Turkish coffee]] or rice dishes like [[pilaf]], meat and vegetable dishes like the [[eggplant]], used in [[eggplant salads and appetizers]], stuffed peppers and stuffed cabbage called ''[[töltött káposzta]]''. Hungarian cuisine was influenced by [[Austrian cuisine]] under the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed from Austrian cuisine, and vice versa.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foodbycountry.com/Germany-to-Japan/Hungary.html |title=Food in Hungary |publisher=foodbycountry.com |access-date=23 May 2014}}</ref>

Budapest restaurants reflect diversity, with menus carrying traditional regional cuisine, fusions of various culinary influences, or innovating in the leading edge of new techniques.

Like Budapest, many of them are the most influential and largest cities of their country and region, most of them are the primate city and political, economical, cultural capital of their country. The Mayor of Budapest says the aim of improving sister city relationships is to allow and encourage a mutual exchange of information and experiences, as well as co-operation, in the areas of city management, education, culture, tourism, media and communication, trade and business development.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kultura.hu/budapest-to-sign-sister |title=Budapest to Sign Sister City Agreement with Beijing |access-date=25 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427033819/https://www.kultura.hu/budapest-to-sign-sister |archive-date=27 April 2014}}</ref>
