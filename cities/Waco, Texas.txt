==History==
{{For timeline|Timeline of Waco, Texas}}

===?–1824===
[[Indigenous peoples]] occupied areas along the river for thousands of years. In historic times, the area of present-day Waco was occupied by the [[Wichita people|Wichita]] [[Native Americans of the United States|Indian]] tribe known as the "[[Waco tribe|Waco]]" (Spanish: ''Hueco'' or ''Huaco'').


===1824–1865===
In 1824, Thomas M. Duke was sent to explore the area after violence erupted between the Waco people and the European settlers.
His report to [[Stephen F. Austin]], described the Waco village:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digitalaustinpapers.org/document?id=APB0790|title=Thomas M. Duke to Stephen F. Austin, 06-xx-1824|website=Digital Austin Papers|language=en|access-date=April 30, 2019}}</ref>
{{blockquote | This town is situated on the West Bank of the [[Brazos River|river]]. They have a spring almost as cold as ice itself. All we want is some Brandy and Sugar to have Ice Toddy. They have about {{convert|400|acre|km2}} planted in corn, beans, pumpkins, and melons and that tended in good order. I think they cannot raise more than One Hundred Warriors. |Thomas M. Duke|source=Stephen F. Austin Papers}}

After further violence, Austin halted an attempt to destroy their village in retaliation. In 1825, he made a treaty with them.
The Waco were eventually pushed out of the region, settling north near present-day [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]. In 1872, they were moved onto a reservation in [[Oklahoma]] with other Wichita tribes. In 1902, the Waco received allotments of land and became official US citizens.
[[Neil McLennan]] settled in an area near the South [[Bosque River]] in 1838.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fmc89|title=McClennan, Neil |first=Longwell, Evelyn |last=Clark|date=June 15, 2010|website=www.tshaonline.org}}</ref> [[Jacob De Cordova]] bought McLennan's property<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fde03|title=De Cordova, Jacob Raphael |first=Ornish|last=Natalie |date=June 12, 2010|website=www.tshaonline.org}}</ref> and hired a former [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] and surveyor named [[George B.

[[File:Old map-Waco-1886.jpg|thumb|left|Waco in 1886]]
[[File:Suspension Bridge, Waco, Texas.jpg|thumb|left|Suspension Bridge, Waco, Texas]]

In 1866, Waco's leading citizens embarked on an ambitious project to build the first bridge to span the wide [[Brazos River]]. They formed the Waco Bridge Company to build the {{convert|475|ft|m|adj=on}} brick [[Waco Suspension Bridge]], which was completed in 1870. The company commissioned a firm owned by [[John Augustus Roebling]] in [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], New Jersey, to supply the bridge's cables and steelwork and contracted with Mr. Thomas M. Griffith, a civil engineer based in New York, for the supervisory engineering work.<ref>{{cite book| last=Roger| first=Conger| title=The Waco Suspension Bridge| year=1992| publisher=Friends of the Texas Ranger Library| page=224}}</ref> The economic effects of the Waco bridge were immediate and large. The cowboys and cattle-herds following the [[Chisholm Trail]] north, crossed the Brazos River at Waco. Some chose to pay the Suspension Bridge toll, while others floated their herds down the river. The population of Waco grew rapidly, as immigrants now had a safe crossing for their horse-drawn carriages and wagons. Since 1971, the bridge has been open only to pedestrian traffic and is in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

Waco was the original intended western terminus of the [[Texas and St. Louis Railway]], with the town having been reached in 1881.<ref name=Rails>{{cite web|url= https://www.american-rails.com/cotton.html |title=St. Louis Southwestern Railway, "The Cotton Belt Route"|publisher=American-Rails, June 12, 2023|accessdate=October 8, 2023}}</ref>  However, the line was extended further west to [[Gatesville, Texas|Gatesville]] a year later.<ref name=TSL>{{cite web|url= https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/texas-and-st-louis-railway|title=Texas and St. Louis Railway|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=October 8, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=  https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/gatesville-tx  |title=Gatesville, TX|publisher= Texas State Historical Society|accessdate=October 8, 2023}}</ref>  This trackage later became the core of the [[St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company]], commonly known as the Cotton Belt.<ref name=Museum>{{cite web|url= https://arkansasrailroadmuseum.org/about/cotton-belt-route.html |title=St. Louis Southwestern Railroad History|publisher=Arkansas Railroad Museum|accessdate=October 5, 2023}}</ref>

In the late 19th century, a [[red-light district]] called the "Reservation" grew up in Waco, and [[prostitution]] was regulated by the city. The Reservation was suppressed in the early 20th century. In 1885, the [[soft drink]] [[Dr Pepper]] was invented in Waco at Morrison's Old Corner Drug Store.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Perez|first=Samara|date=April 13, 2020|title=Made in Texas: The man who created Dr Pepper wanted his drink to smell like a drug store he liked|url=https://www.click2houston.com/features/2020/04/13/made-in-texas-the-man-who-created-dr-pepper-wanted-his-drink-to-smell-like-a-drug-store-he-liked/|access-date=January 17, 2021|website=KPRC|language=en}}</ref>

In 1845, [[Baylor University]] was founded in [[Independence, Texas|Independence]], Texas. It moved to Waco in 1886 and merged with Waco University, becoming an integral part of the city. The university's Strecker Museum was also the oldest continuously operating museum in the state until it closed in 2003, and the collections moved to the new [[Mayborn Museum Complex]]. In 1873, AddRan College was founded by brothers Addison and Randolph Clark in Fort Worth. The school moved to Waco in 1895, changing its name to Add-Ran Christian University and taking up residence in the empty buildings of Waco Female College. Add-Ran changed its name to [[Texas Christian University]] in 1902 and left Waco after the school's main building burned down in 1910.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Waters|first=Rick|date=March 1, 2010|title=A fateful fire|url=https://magazine.tcu.edu/spring-2010/a-fateful-fire/|access-date=January 17, 2021|website=TCU Magazine|language=en}}</ref> TCU was offered a {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} campus and $200,000 by the city of Fort Worth to relocate there.<ref name=":0" />

[[Racial segregation]] was common in Waco. For example, [[Greenwood Cemetery (Waco)|Greenwood Cemetery]] was established in the 1870s as a segregated burial place. Black graves were divided from white ones by a fence which remained standing until 2016.<ref name="Strouse">{{cite web |url=https://wacohistory.org/items/show/164 |title=Greenwood Cemetery |first1=Dalton |last1=Strouse |first2=Amanda |last2=Sawyer |website=Waco History |access-date=July 10, 2021 |quote=}}</ref>

In the 1890s, [[William Cowper Brann]] published the highly successful ''Iconoclast'' newspaper in Waco. One of his targets was Baylor University. Brann revealed Baylor officials had been trafficking South American children recruited by missionaries and making house-servants out of them. Brann was shot in the back by Tom Davis, a Baylor supporter. Brann then wheeled, drew his pistol, and killed Davis. Brann was helped home by his friends, and died there of his wounds.

In 1894, the first Cotton Palace fair and exhibition center was built to reflect the dominant contribution of the agricultural [[cotton]] industry in the region. Since the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], cotton had been cultivated in the Brazos and Bosque valleys, and Waco had become known nationwide as a top producer. Over the next 23 years, the annual exposition would welcome over eight million attendees. The opulent building which housed the month-long exhibition was destroyed by fire and rebuilt in 1910. In 1931, the exposition fell prey to the [[Great Depression]], and the building was torn down. However, the annual Cotton Palace Pageant continues, hosted in late April in conjunction with the Brazos River Festival.

On September 15, 1896, "The Crash" took place about {{convert|15|mi|km}} north of Waco. "The Crash at Crush" was a publicity stunt done by the [[Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad]] company (known as M-K-T or "Katy"), featuring two locomotives intentionally set to a head-on collision. Meant to be a family fun event with food, games, and entertainment, the Crash turned deadly when both boilers exploded simultaneously, sending metal flying in the air. Three people died and dozens were injured.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Deadly Crashat Crush|url=https://www.texascooppower.com/texas_stories/history/the-deadly-crash-at-crush|access-date=January 17, 2021|website=Texas Co-op Power Magazine|language=en-us}}</ref>

An [[African American]] man named Sank Majors was hanged from the [[Washington Avenue Bridge (Waco, Texas)|Washington Avenue Bridge]] by a white mob in 1905. Another man, Jim Lawyer, was attacked with a whip because he objected to the [[Lynching in the United States|lynching]]. In both cases the mob was assisted by [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]].<ref name="Minutaglio">{{cite book |last=Minutaglio |first=Bill |date=2021 |author-link=Bill Minutaglio |title=A Single Star and Bloody Knuckles: A History of Politics and Race in Texas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lYcHEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA77 |location= |publisher=University of Texas Press |page=77 |isbn=978-1477310366}}</ref>

[[File:Lynching of Jesse Washington, 1916 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Lynching of Jesse Washington]] in Waco on May 15, 1916. He was repeatedly lowered and raised onto a fire for about two hours.]]
In 1916, a Black teenager named [[Jesse Washington]] was tortured, mutilated, and burned to death in the town square by a [[Ochlocracy|mob]] that seized him from the courthouse, where he had been convicted of murdering a white woman, to which he confessed. About 15,000 spectators, mostly citizens of Waco, were present. The commonly named [[Waco Horror]] drew international condemnation and became the ''[[cause célèbre]]'' of the nascent [[NAACP]]'s anti-[[lynching]] campaign. In 2006, the Waco City Council officially condemned the lynching, which took place without opposition from local political or judicial leaders; the mayor and chief of police were spectators. On the centenary of the lynching, May 15, 2016, the mayor apologized in a ceremony to some of Washington's descendants. A historical marker is being erected.<ref>{{cite book | first1 = Andrew | last1 = Lichtenstein | first2 = Alex | last2 = Lichtenstein | title = Marked Unmarked Remembered.

In 1937, Grover C. Thomsen and R. H. Roark created a soft-drink called "Sun Tang Red Cream Soda". This would become known as the soft drink [[Big Red (drink)|Big Red]].

On May 5, 1942, Waco Army Air Field opened as a basic pilot training school, and on June 10, 1949, the name was changed to [[James Connally Air Force Base|Connally Air Force Base]] in memory of Col. James T. Connally, a local pilot killed in Japan in 1945. The name changed again in 1951 to the James Connally Air Force Base. The base closed in May 1966 and is now the location of [[Texas State Technical College]], formerly Texas State Technical Institute, since 1965. The airfield is still in operation, now known as [[TSTC Waco Airport]], and was used by [[Air Force One]] when former [[US President]] [[George W. Bush]] visited his [[Prairie Chapel Ranch]], also known as the [[Western White House]], in [[Crawford, Texas|Crawford]], Texas.

In 1951, Harold Goodman founded the [[American Income Life Insurance Company]].

In 1964, the [[Texas Department of Public Safety]] designated Waco as the site for the state-designated official museum of the legendary [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] law enforcement agency founded in 1823. In 1976, it was further designated the official Hall of Fame for the Rangers and renamed the [[Texas Ranger Hall of Fame and Museum]]. Renovations by the Waco government earned this building green status, the first Waco government-led project of its nature. The construction project has fallen under scrutiny for expanding the building over unmarked human graves.

In 1978, bones were discovered emerging from the mud at the confluence of the Brazos and [[Bosque River]]s. Excavations revealed the bones were 68,000 years old and belonged to a species of [[mammoth]]. Eventually, the remains of at least 24 mammoths, one camel, and one large cat were found at the site, making it one of the largest findings of its kind. Scholars have puzzled over why such a large herd had been killed at once. The bones are on display at the [[Waco Mammoth National Monument]], part of the [[National Park Service]].

The [[Baylor Bears]] athletics teams compete in Waco. The [[Baylor Bears football|football team]] has won or tied for nine conference titles, and have played in 24 bowl games, garnering a record of 13–11. The [[Baylor Lady Bears basketball|women's basketball team]] won the [[NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament]] in 2005, 2012 and 2019. The [[Baylor Bears basketball|men's basketball team]] won the [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament]] in [[2021 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2021]].

The Waco BlueCats, an independent minor league baseball team, planned to play in the inaugural season of the [[Southwest League of Professional Baseball]] in 2019. A new ballpark was planned for the suburb of [[Bellmead, Texas|Bellmead]].<ref>{{cite news |title=New for 2018: Waco BlueCats |url=https://ballparkdigest.com/2016/11/30/new-for-2018-waco-bluecats/ |access-date=April 10, 2022 |date=November 30, 2016 |work=Ballpark Digest |publisher=August Publications}}</ref>

The [[American Basketball Association (2000–present)|American Basketball Association]] had a franchise for part of the 2006 season, the Waco Wranglers. The team played at [[Reicher Catholic High School]] and practiced at Texas State Technical College.

Previous professional sports franchises in Waco have proven unsuccessful. The [[Waco Marshals]] of the [[National Indoor Football League]] lasted less than two months amidst a midseason ownership change in 2004. (The team became the beleaguered [[Cincinnati Marshals]] the following year.) The Waco Wizards of the now-defunct [[Western Professional Hockey League]] fared better, lasting into a fourth season before folding in 2000. Both teams played at the [[Heart O' Texas Coliseum]], one of Waco's largest entertainment and sports venues.

The [[Southern Indoor Football League]] announced that Waco was an expansion market for the 2010 season. It was rumored they would play in the Heart O' Texas Coliseum. However, the league broke up into three separate leagues, and subsequently, a team did not come to Waco in any of the new leagues.

Professional [[baseball]] first came to Waco in 1889 with the formation of the [[Waco Tigers]], a member of the [[Texas League]]. The Tigers were renamed the [[Waco Navigators|Navigators]] in 1905, and later the [[Waco Steers|Steers]]. In 1920, the team was sold to [[Wichita Falls, Texas|Wichita Falls]]. In 1923, a new franchise called the [[Waco Indians|Indians]] was formed and became a member of the [[Class D (baseball)|Class D]] level [[Texas Association]]. In 1925, Waco rejoined the Texas League with the formation of the [[Waco Cubs]].

On June 20, 1930, the first night game in Texas League history was played at [[Katy Park]] in Waco. The lights were donated by Waco resident Charles Redding Turner, who owned a local farm team for recruits to the Chicago Cubs.

On the night of August 6, 1930, baseball history was made at Katy Park: in the eighth inning of a night game against [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]], Waco left fielder Gene Rye became the only player in the history of professional baseball to hit three home runs in one inning.

The last year Waco had a team in the Texas League was 1930, but fielded some strong semipro teams in the 1930s and early 1940s. During the World War II years of 1943–1945, the powerful Waco Army Air Field team was probably the best in the state; many major leaguers played for the team, and it was managed by big-league catcher [[Birdie Tebbetts]].

In 1947, the [[Class B (baseball)|Class B]] level [[Big State League]] was organized with Waco as a member called the [[Waco Dons]].

In 1948, A.H. Kirksey, owner of Katy Park, persuaded the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] club to take over the Waco operation, and the nickname was changed to Pirates. The [[Waco Pirates|Pirates]] vaulted into third place in 1948. They dropped a notch to fourth in 1949, but prevailed in the playoffs to win the league championship. The Pirates then tumbled into the second division, bottoming out with a dreadful 29–118, 0.197 club in 1952. This mark ranks as one of the 10 worst marks of any 20th-century full-season team. When the tornado struck in 1953, it destroyed the park. The team relocated to [[Longview, Texas|Longview]] to finish the season and finished a respectable third with a 77–68 record.

Waco has many golf clubs and courses, including Cottonwood Creek Golf Course.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.waco-texas.com/cms-cottonwoodcountryclub/|title=Cottonwood Creek Golf Course|publisher=waco-texas.com|access-date=September 11, 2018|archive-date=September 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180911191622/https://www.waco-texas.com/cms-cottonwoodcountryclub/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2013 a lone star was added to the center of the circle.  Lane markings and new signage were added in 2018 to improve traffic flow and to help guide drivers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Waco: Traffic circle sees improvements for drivers |url=https://www.kwtx.com/content/news/Waco-traffic-circle-sees-improvements-for-drivers-484094701.html |website=KWTX |date=May 30, 2018 |access-date=7 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180602232546/https://www.kwtx.com/content/news/Waco-traffic-circle-sees-improvements-for-drivers-484094701.html |archive-date=2 June 2018}}</ref>
