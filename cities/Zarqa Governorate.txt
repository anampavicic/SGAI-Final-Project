[[File:Qasr Al-Hallabat mosque.jpg|thumb|[[Nabatean]] Palace [[Qasr al Hallabat]]|left]]
The land of Zarqa Governorate has been inhabited since the [[Bronze Age]], most prominent were the [[Ammon]]ite kingdom and the [[Nabateans]], who constructed the fort known as [[Qasr al Hallabat]], which then was used as a fort by the Romans, and then as a desert palace by the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]].

The most significant historical remains are the Umayyad desert palaces, such as [[Qasr Amra]], a [[World Heritage Site]], [[Qasr al Hallabat]], Qasr Shabib in the center of the city of Zarqa, as well as the Castle of Azraq.

After the construction of the [[Hedjaz railway]] by the Ottoman Turks at the beginning of the 1900s, Zarqa became a strategically important hub that connects [[Damascus]] to [[Medina]], the cities along the railway started flourishing. Later, Jordan's [[Arab Legion]] led by [[Glubb Pasha]] had its main bases in Zarqa.
