'''Turkistan''' ({{langx|kk|Түркістан / Türkıstan}} {{IPA|kk|tʉrkɘ̆sˈtɑn|}}) is a city and the administrative center of [[Turkistan Region]] of [[Kazakhstan]], near the [[Syr Darya]] river. It is situated {{cvt|160|km|mi|-1}} north-west of [[Shymkent]] on the [[Trans-Aral Railway]] between [[Kyzylorda]] to the north and [[Tashkent]] to the south. Its population has increased in ten years from {{Kz-census1999|102,505|punct=}} to {{Kz-census2009|142,899|punct=.}} Turkistan's most prominent historical and cultural asset is the [[Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi]], a UNESCO World Heritage site.<ref name="unesco-site">{{cite web|title=World Heritage List|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1103 |website=UNESCO}}</ref> The city is served by [[Hazrat Sultan International Airport]].

In 2021, Turkistan was proclaimed by the [[Organization of Turkic States]] as "Spiritual Capital of the Turkic World".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Turkistan Declaration of the Informal Summit of the Cooperation Council of Turkic Speaking States|url=https://www.turkkon.org/en/haberler/turkistan-declaration-of-the-informal-summit-of-the-cooperation-council-of-turkic-speaking-states_2220|publisher=Turkic Council}}</ref> In the same year, Turkistan was named as one of the top ten tourist destinations in Kazakhstan.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kazakhstan Selects Top 10 Tourist Destinations|url=https://astanatimes.com/2021/06/kazakhstan-selects-top-10-tourist-destinations/|access-date=2021-09-27|website=The Astana Times|date=16 June 2021 |language=en}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The modern city name of Turkistan ({{langx|kk|Түркістан|Türkıstan}}, {{IPA|kk|tʉrkɘ̆sˈtɑn|pron}}) is derived from the [[Turco-Persian tradition|Turco-Persian]] phrase '''Hazrat-i-Turkistan'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Ahmed-Yesevi |title=Encyclopædia Britannica (2007): Related Articles to "Ahmed Yesevi, or Ahmad Yasawi, or Ahmed Yasavi (Turkish author)", accessed March 18, 2007 |publisher=Britannica.com |access-date=2013-04-09}}</ref> ([[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] and {{langx|fa|حضرت ترکستان}}, {{small|meaning ''"Saint of Turkistan"''}}), which is in reference to [[Ahmad Yasawi]], a prominent 11th-century poet and [[Sufi]] who was associated with and rested in this city.

Prior to [[Ahmad Yasawi|Ahmad Yasawi's]] era, and during a significant portion of the medieval to early-modern era, the city was referred to as '''Iasy''' ([[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] and {{langx|fa|یسی}}) or '''Shavgar''' ([[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] and {{langx|fa|شاوغر}}).

==History==
Turkistan, one of Kazakhstan's historic cities, has an [[archaeological record]] dating back to the 4th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.natcom.unesco.kz/turkestan/e08_arch_monuments.htm|title=Archeological monuments of Turkistan|publisher=Natcom.unesco.kz |access-date=2012-04-22}}</ref>

The city emerged as a commercial hub following the decline of [[Otrar]], an ancient city with remnants located southeast near the Syr Darya. Owing to the impact of [[Ahmad Yasawi]], and in honor of his legacy, the city evolved into a significant hub for spiritual growth and Islamic education for the inhabitants of the Kazakh steppes. In the 1390s, [[Timur]], the Turco-Mongol leader and the originator of the Timurid dynasty, constructed an impressive domed [[Mazar (mausoleum)|''mazar'']] or [[Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi|mausoleum]] over Yasawi's resting place. This structure stands as one of the most notable architectural landmarks in Kazakhstan. Until 2006, its image was featured on the reverse side of the country's banknotes.

The city also boasts other significant historical landmarks such as a medieval bath-house and four mausoleums. One of these is dedicated to [[Mausoleum of Rabiya Sultan Begim|Rabiya Sultan Begim]], Timur's great-granddaughter, while the other three pay tribute to [[Kazakh Khanate|Kazakh khans]] (rulers).

Prior to the 19th-century Russian arrival, Turkistan was positioned at the boundary between the established Perso-Islamic [[oasis]] civilization of [[Transoxiana]] to its south and the vast expanse of the Kazakh steppes to its north. 

Between the 16th and 18th centuries, Turkistan rose to prominence as the capital of the [[Kazakh Khanate]],<ref>[http://www.unesco.kz/natcom/turkestan/r07_turkest_cap.htm Туркестан — столица Казахского ханства]</ref> becoming the political epicenter of the [[Kazakh steppe]]. However, as the [[Russian Empire]] expanded its conquests and weakened the [[Kazakh Khanate]], smaller southern states were overtaken. By 1864, Russian General Veryovkin had captured Turkistan for the [[Khanate of Kokand|Kokand Khanate]]. Subsequently, under Russian rule, it became a part of the [[Syr-Darya Oblast]] in the [[Governor-general|Governor-Generalship]] of Russian Turkistan. Following the collapse of the [[Tsarist autocracy|Tsarist]] regime between 1917-18, it briefly joined the [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkistan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]. By 1924, it became a part of the [[Kazakh ASSR]] within [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]].

On June 19, 2018, [[Shymkent]] was removed from the South Kazakhstan Region and placed directly under the governance of Kazakhstan. Concurrently, Turkistan became the regional administrative hub, and the region was renamed the Turkistan Region.<ref>{{cite web |date=19 June 2018 |title=Публичное подписание Указа "О некоторых вопросах административно-территориального устройства Республики Казахстан" |url=http://www.akorda.kz/ru/events/akorda_news/akorda_other_events/publichnoe-podpisanie-ukaza-o-nekotoryh-voprosah-administrativno-territorialnogo-ustroistva-respubliki-kazahstan |access-date=21 June 2018 |publisher=President of Kazakhstan |language=ru}}</ref>

In 2021, it was announced that the first [[5G]] city will be set up in Turkistan. This project will be sponsored by [[Kcell]] and [[Ericsson]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=First Fully 5G City in Kazakhstan to Be Founded in Turkistan|url=https://astanatimes.com/2021/12/firsts-fully-5g-city-in-kazakhstan-to-be-founded-in-turkistan/|access-date=2021-12-13|website=The Astana Times|date=13 December 2021 |language=en}}</ref>{{what|Shouldn't this say of "of Kazakhstan"? I'm quite certain it wasn't there first one anywhere|date=March 2023}}

===Pilgrimage===
[[File:Landsat turkestan.jpg|240px|thumb|Landsat satellite photo of Turkistan]]
The city draws thousands of pilgrims. As per local tradition, visiting Turkistan three times is akin to a single [[hajj]] to [[Mecca]], a sentiment echoed in other revered sites across the [[Muslim world]]. Such high regard for the Saint led to Turkistan being dubbed the ''Second Mecca of the East'', profoundly influencing the spiritual essence of Kazakhstan's Muslim community.<ref>Privatsky (2001)</ref>
