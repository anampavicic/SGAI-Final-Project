The former [[Celts|Celtic]] territory was settled by [[Alamanni]] in the 4th or 5th century later by the [[Franks]] in the 6th to 7th. Würzburg was the seat of a [[Merovingian]] duke from about 650. It was Christianized in 686 by [[Irish missionaries]] [[Saint Kilian|Kilian]], [[St. Colman (martyr)|Kolonat]] and [[Saint Totnan|Totnan]]. The city is mentioned in a donation by Duke [[Hedan II]] to bishop [[Willibrord]], dated 1 May 704, ''in castellum Virteburch''. The [[Ravenna Cosmography]] lists the city as ''Uburzis'' at about the same time.<ref>Norbert Wagner, 'Uburzis-Wirziburg "Würzburg"'</ref> The name is presumably of [[Celtic toponyms|Celtic]] origin, but based on a [[folk etymology|folk etymological]] connection to the German word ''[[:wikt:Würze|Würze]]'' "herb, spice", the name was [[Medieval Latin|Latinized]] as ''Herbipolis'' in the medieval period.<ref>Heinz Willner, ''Der Name Würzburg'', Frankenland 1/1999.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sacred Magic of Abramelin: The First Book: The Eighth Chapter |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/grim/abr/abr014.htm#fn_58 |website=www.sacred-texts.com |access-date=8 July 2021}}</ref>

The first diocese was founded by [[Saint Boniface]] in 742 when he appointed the first [[Bishopric of Würzburg|bishop of Würzburg]], [[Burchard of Würzburg|Saint Burkhard]]. The [[Bishops in the Catholic Church|bishops]] eventually created a secular fiefdom, that extended to Eastern [[duchy of Franconia|Franconia]] in the 12th century. The city was the site of several [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diets]], including the one of 1180, at which [[Henry the Lion]], duke of Saxony and Bavaria, was banned for three years from the Empire<ref name="EB1911"/> and his [[Kingdom of Bavaria|duchy]] Bavaria was handed over to [[Otto I of Wittelsbach, Duke of Bavaria|Otto of Wittelsbach]]. Massacres of Jews took place in 1147 and 1298.

The first church on the site of the present [[Würzburg Cathedral]] was built as early as 788 and consecrated that same year by [[Charlemagne]]; the current building was constructed from 1040 to 1225 in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style. The [[University of Würzburg]] was founded in 1402 and re-founded in 1582 by [[Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn]]. The citizens of the city revolted several times against the prince-bishop.

In 1397, King [[Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia]] visited the city and promised its people the status of a [[free Imperial City]]. However, the German ruling princes forced him to withdraw these promises. In 1400, the bishop's troops decisively defeated the citizenry in the {{ill|Battle of Bergtheim|de|Schlacht von Bergtheim}}, and the city fell under his control permanently until the dissolution of the fiefdom.<ref name="Dumont"/>{{rp|41}} During the [[German Peasants' War]], a local town council member, [[Tilman Riemenschneider]] refused to obey an order by [[Konrad von Thüngen]], the [[Prince-Bishop of Würzburg]] to fight the revolting peasants.<ref name="Booklet">{{cite book |title=Tilman Riemenschneider – Werke seiner Blütezeit (German) |publisher=Freunde Mainfränkischer Kunst und Geschichte e.V. Würzburg |year=2004}}</ref>{{rp|23}} This resulted in 8,000 peasants killed on 4 June 1525 just outside Würzburg. Riemenschneider and the entire town council was incarcerated and tortured in [[Marienberg Fortress]].<ref name="Booklet" />{{rp|24}}

=== Modern history ===
The [[Würzburg witch trials]], which occurred between 1626 and 1631, are one of the largest peace-time mass trials. In Würzburg, under Bishop [[Philipp Adolf von Ehrenberg|Philip Adolf]], an estimated 600 to 900 alleged witches were burnt.<ref>Wolfgang Behringer, ''Witchcraft in Bavaria: Popular Magik, Religious Zealotry, and Reason of State in Early Modern Europe'', (Cambridge University Press, 1997).</ref> In 1631, Swedish King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustaf Adolf]] invaded and ended the witch burnings.

In 1720, the foundations of the [[Würzburg Residence]] were laid. In 1796, the [[Battle of Würzburg]] between [[Austrian monarchy|Habsburg Austria]] and the [[First French Republic]] took place. The city passed to the [[Electorate of Bavaria]] in 1803 but, two years later, in the course of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], it became the seat of the Electorate of Würzburg (until September 1806), the later [[Grand Duchy of Würzburg]].

In 1814, the town became part of the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Würzburg|a new bishopric]] was created seven years later, as the former one had been [[German mediatization|secularized in 1803]] (see also [[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]).
In 1817, [[Friedrich Koenig]] and [[Andreas Friedrich Bauer|Andreas Bauer]] founded ''Schnellpressenfabrik Koenig & Bauer'' (the world's first steam-driven [[printing press]] manufacturer).

The [[Hep-Hep riots]] from August to October 1819 were [[pogrom]]s against [[Ashkenazi Jews]], beginning in the Kingdom of Bavaria, during the period of Jewish emancipation in the [[German Confederation]]. The antisemitic communal violence began on August 2, 1819, in Würzburg and soon reached the outer regions of the German Confederation. Many Jews were killed, and much Jewish property was destroyed.

In 1848, Catholic bishops held the [[Würzburg Bishops' Conference]], a forerunner of later German and Austrian conferences. By distinction, the ''Würzburg Conference'' is a name given to the meeting of representatives of the smaller German states in 1859 to devise some means of mutual support. The conference, however, had no result. Würzburg was bombarded and taken by the [[Prussia]]ns in 1866 when it ceased to be a fortress.<ref name="EB1911"/>

In the early 1930s, around 2,000 Jews lived in Würzburg, which was also a rabbinic centre. The [[Nazi Party]] in [[Enabling Act of 1933|1933 achieved total control]]. During the ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' pogroms in 1938, many Jewish houses and shops were raided, looted, or destroyed.<ref name=kn>{{cite web|url=https://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/communities/wurzburg/kristallnacht.asp|title=Würzburg During the Holocaust.

From April 1943 to March 1945 a subcamp of the [[Flossenbürg concentration camp]] was located in the city, with dozens of prisoners, mostly from Poland and the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gedenkstaette-flossenbuerg.de/en/history/satellite-camps/wuerzburg|title=Würzburg Subcamp|website=KZ-Gedenkstätte Flossenbürg|access-date=14 June 2020}}</ref>

====World War II bombing====
{{main|Bombing of Würzburg in World War II}}
On 16 March 1945, about 90% of the city was destroyed in 17 minutes by firebombing from 225 British [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bombers]] during a [[World War II]] air raid. Würzburg became a target for its role as a traffic hub and to break the spirit of the population.<ref name="Dumont">{{cite book|last=Dettelbacher|first=Werner|title=Franken - Kunst, Geschichte und Landschaft (German)|publisher=Dumont Verlag|year=1974|isbn=3-7701-0746-2}}</ref>{{rp|19}}

All of the city's churches, cathedrals, and other monuments were heavily damaged or destroyed. The city centre, which mostly dated from medieval times, was destroyed in a [[firestorm]] in which 5,000 people perished.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

Over the next 20 years, the buildings of historical importance were painstakingly and accurately reconstructed. The citizens who rebuilt the city immediately after the end of the war were mostly women – ''[[Trümmerfrauen]]'' ("rubble women") – because the men were either dead or still [[prisoners of war]]. On a relative scale, Würzburg was destroyed to a larger extent than was [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Dresden in a firebombing]] the previous month.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}} Today the whole of the old town is sited as a cultural heritage site after decades of rebuilding and reconstructions.<ref name="auto"/>

====Battle of Würzburg====
{{main|Battle of Würzburg (1945)}}
On 3 April 1945, Würzburg was occupied by the U.S. [[12th Armored Division (United States)|12th Armored Division]] and the U.S. [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd Infantry Division]] in a series of frontal assaults masked by smokescreens. The battle continued until the last German resistance was defeated on 5 April 1945.<ref>Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939–1946'' (Revised Edition, 2006), Stackpole Books, p. 65, 129.</ref><ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/III/AAF-III-21.html Seite 777], see also [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/III/AAF-III-21.html Chapter XVIII]</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Wuerzburg mit Festung Marienberg Luftansicht 20160813.jpg|thumb|Würzburg with [[Marienberg Fortress|Fortress Marienberg]] and [[Main (river)|Main]] river]]
[[File:2019-06-07 Wuerzburg panorama from Festung.jpg|thumb|Panoramic view of city center from the [[Marienberg Fortress|fortress]] with [[Main (river)|Main]] river]]
Würzburg spans the banks of the [[Main (river)|river Main]] in the region of Lower Franconia in the north of the state of Bavaria, Germany. The heart of the town is on the locally eastern ([[bank (geography)|right]]) bank. The town is enclosed by the ''Landkreis Würzburg'' but is not a part of it.

Würzburg covers an area of 87.6 square kilometres and lies at an altitude of around 177 metres.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Wuerzburg|first=Stadt|title=Rathaus {{!}} Würzburg in Zahlen - Stadtgebiet, Flächennutzung, Klima|url=https://www.wuerzburg.de/buerger/statistikstadtforschung/stadtgebietflaechennutzungklima/32319.Stadtgebiet-Flaechennutzung-Klima.html|access-date=2020-09-27|website=www.wuerzburg.de}}</ref>

Of the total municipal area, in 2007, building area accounted for 30%, followed by agricultural land (27.9%), forestry/wood (15.5%), green spaces (12.7%), traffic (5.4%), water (1.2%) and others (7.3%).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wuerzburg.de/media/www.wuerzburg.de/org/med_5493/402237_flaechenaufteilung_stadtgebiet.pdf |title=Data  |website=www.wuerzburg.de |access-date=2020-09-27}}</ref>

The centre of Würzburg is surrounded by hills. To the west lies the 266-meter Marienberg and the Nikolausberg (359 m) to the south of it. The Main flows through Würzburg from the southeast to the northwest.

===City structure===
Würzburg is divided into 13 ''[[Stadtbezirk|Stadtbezirke]]'' which are additionally structured into 25 [[borough]]s. The following overview shows the boroughs and their numbers allocated to the 13 municipalities.

==Economy==
Würzburg is mainly known as an administrative centre. Its largest employers are the [[University of Würzburg|Julius-Maximilians-University]] and the municipality. The largest private employers are [[Brose Fahrzeugteile]] followed by [[Koenig & Bauer]], a maker of printing machines. Würzburg is also the capital of the German wine region [[Franconia (wine region)|Franconia]] which is famous for its mineral-rich dry white wines, especially from the [[Silvaner]] grape. [[Würzburger Hofbräu]] brewery also locally produces a well-known pilsner beer.

Würzburg is home to the oldest pizzeria in Germany. Nick di Camillo opened his restaurant named ''Bier- und Speisewirtschaft Capri'' on 24 March 1952.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/regionales/muenchen/article13946943/GIs-rissen-sich-um-die-erste-Pizza-in-Deutschland.html|title=Würzburg: GIs rissen sich um die Erste Pizza in Deutschland|first=Ralph|last=Bauer|date=March 26, 2012|via=www.welt.de}}</ref> Camillo received the honour of the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic|Italian Order of Merit]].

In 2017, the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per inhabitant was €62,229, placing the district 13th out of 96 districts (rural and urban) in Bavaria (overall average: €46,698).<ref name="Stat2">{{cite web|url=https://www.statistik-bw.de/VGRdL/tbls/RV2014/R2B1.zip|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108184359/https://www.statistik-bw.de/VGRdL/tbls/RV2014/R2B1.zip|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 8, 2018|title=VGR der Länder, Kreisergebnisse für Deutschland - Bruttoinlandsprodukt, Bruttowertschöpfung in den kreisfreien Städten und Landkreisen der Bundesrepublik Deutschland 2000 bis 2017 (German)|publisher=Statistische Ämter der Länder und des Bundes|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>

===Military===
Following World War II, Würzburg was occupied by the U.S. Army's [[U.S. 1st Infantry Division|1st]] and [[U.S. 3d Infantry Division|3rd]] infantry divisions, as well as an Army hospital staff and various other U.S. military units. The last U.S. troops were withdrawn in 2008, concluding more than 60 years of U.S. presence in Würzburg.

==Arts and culture==
Notable artists who lived in Würzburg include poet [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] (12th and 13th centuries), philosopher [[Albertus Magnus]] and painter [[Matthias Grünewald]]. Sculptor [[Tilman Riemenschneider]] (1460–1531) served as mayor and participated in the [[German Peasants' War]]. [[Richard Wagner]] obtained the position of chorusmaster at the city’s theater in 1833 through his brother, Albert, and finished his first opera, [[Die Feen]] (The Fairies), there that year (see Wikipedia article on Richard Wagner).

Some of the city's "100 churches" survived intact. In style they range from [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] ([[Würzburg Cathedral]]), [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] (''[[Marienkapelle, Würzburg|Marienkapelle]]''), [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] (''{{Interlanguage link|Neubaukirche (Würzburg)|de|3=Neubaukirche (Würzburg)|lt=Neubaukirche}}''), [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] (''{{Interlanguage link|Kollegiatstift Haug|de|3=Kollegiatstift Haug|lt=Stift Haug Kirche}}'') to modern (St. Andreas).

Major festivals include the ''Africa Festival'' in May, the ''[[Mozart Festival Würzburg|Mozart Festival]]'' in June/July, and the ''Kiliani Volksfest'' in mid-July.

===Main sights===

[[File:Falkenhaus in Wurzburg 01.jpg|thumb|Falkenhaus]]
*''[[Würzburg Residence|Würzburger Residenz]]'': A [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], the vast compound near the center of the town was commissioned by two prince-bishops, the brothers [[Johann Philipp Franz von Schönborn|Johann Philipp Franz]] and [[Friedrich Karl von Schönborn]]. Several architects, including [[Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt]] and [[Maximilian von Welsch]], supervised the construction between 1720 and 1744, in imitation of the [[Palace of Versailles]],<ref name="EB1911"/> but it is mainly associated with the name of [[Balthasar Neumann]], the creator of its famous Baroque staircase. The palace suffered severe damage in the British bombing of March 1945 but has been completely rebuilt. The main attractions are:
**''Hofkirche'': The church interior is richly decorated with paintings, sculptures and stucco ornaments. The altars were painted by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]].
**''Treppenhaus'': Here Giovanni Battista Tiepolo created the largest fresco in the world, which adorns the vault over the staircase designed by [[Balthasar Neumann]]. 
**''Kaisersaal'': The "Imperial Hall", the centerpiece of the palace, testifies to the close relationship between Würzburg and the [[Holy Roman Empire]].
*''[[Marienberg Fortress|Festung Marienberg]]'' is a fortress on ''Marienberg'', the hill to the west of the city centre, overlooking the whole town area and the surrounding hills. Most current structures date to the Renaissance and Baroque periods, but the chapel's foundations go back to the 8th century.
[[File:San Kilian.jpg|thumb|The statue of [[Saint Kilian|St Kilian]], with the [[Marienberg Fortress]] on the right]]
*''{{Interlanguage link|Alte Mainbrücke|de}}'' (Old Main Bridge) was built in 1473–1543 to replace the destroyed Romanesque bridge dated 1133. In two phases, beginning in 1730, the bridge was adorned with twelve 4.5-meter statues of saints and historically important figures like [[John of Nepomuk]], [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph]], [[Charlemagne]] and [[Pepin the Short]]. Explosives damaged the bridge in the final days of World War II. US troops threw the original Pepin into the river to make way for an anti-aircraft gun.<ref name="Dumont"/>{{rp|32}}
* The ''Rathaus'' or city hall of Würzburg differs from those of most [[Imperial Cities]] in that it was not a sumptuous edifice purpose-built in Renaissance style. Rather, the motley collection of buildings and wings reflects that after 1426 the city was permanently under the bishop's control, who did not allow a representative new building. The ''Rathaus'' consists of parts dating from 1339 (chapel), 1453 (tower with the town's first public clock), 1544 (southwest oriel), and 1659/60 (''Roter Bau''). In 1822 the three-winged structure of the neighboring ''Karmeliterkloster'' (monastery of the [[Carmelites]]) was added to the city hall. The "Renaissance" row on Karmeliterstrasse was built only in 1898.<ref name="Dumont"/>{{rp|41}}
*Among Würzburg's many notable churches are the ''[[Käppele]]'', a small Baroque/Rococo chapel by Balthasar Neumann, perched on a hill facing the fortress, and the ''Dom'' ([[Würzburg Cathedral]]). The Baroque ''Schönbornkapelle'', a side-chapel of the cathedral, has interior decoration of (artificial) human bones and skulls. Also in the cathedral are two of [[Tilman Riemenschneider]]'s most famous works, the tombstones of [[Rudolf von Scherenberg|Rudolf II von Scherenberg]] (1466–1495) and [[Lorenz von Bibra]] (1495–1519). At the entrance to the ''[[Marienkapelle, Würzburg|Marienkapelle]]'' (on the market square; built between 1377 and 1441) stand replicas of the statues of Adam and Eve by Riemenschneider.<ref name="EB1911"/> The ''[[Neumünster, Würzburg|Neumünster]]'' is a Romanesque (11th century) minster church with a Baroque façade and dome. Its crypt (''Kiliansgruft'') houses the relics of Kilian, Totnan, and Kolonat.<ref name="EB1911"/> There are also two stone sarcophagi from the 8th century, the tombs of the first and second Bishop of Würzburg, Burkard and Megingaud. The latter's tomb features the oldest post-Roman [[monumental inscription]] in Franconia.<ref name="Dumont"/>{{rp|45}} Next to the ''Neumünster'' is the ''{{Interlanguage link|Lusamgärtchen|de}}''. It contains a memorial from 1930 to [[Walther von der Vogelweide]], who very likely was buried here in 1230.<ref name="Dumont"/>{{rp|47}} Only the church remains of the town's oldest abbey, [[St. Burchard's Abbey, Würzburg|St Burchard's Abbey]] founded around 750. It was transformed into a [[collegiate church]] in 1464 and dissolved in 1803. Among the Baroque churches in the city centre is ''Stift Haug'' (1670–1691), ''{{Interlanguage link|St. Michael (Würzburg)|de|3=St. Michael (Würzburg)|lt=St. Michael}}'', ''{{Interlanguage link|St. Stephan (Würzburg)|de|3=St. Stephan (Würzburg)|lt=St. Stephan}}'' and ''St. Peter''. The church of St Burkhard was built between 1033 and 1042 in the Romanesque style and was restored in 1168. The [[International Gothic|Late Gothic]] choir dates from 1494 to 1497.<ref name="EB1911"/>
*The ''[[Stiftung Juliusspital Würzburg|Juliusspital]]'' is a Baroque hospital with a courtyard and a church originally established by prince-bishop [[Julius Echter]] in 1576. The 160 m long northern wing was added by Italian architect {{Interlanguage link|Antonio Petrini|it}} in 1700–1704. Beneath it lies the similarly sized wine cellar, which (together with those of the Würzburg Residence and the ''[[Bürgerspital zum Heiligen Geist|Bürgerspital]]'') offers a chance to taste the local ''[[Franconia (wine region)|Frankenwein]]'' in a unique environment. The Juliusspital is the second largest winery in Germany, growing wine on {{convert|1.68|km2|0|abbr=off}}.<ref name="Dumont"/>{{rp|58–9}}
*The ''{{Interlanguage link|Haus zum Falken|de}}'' on Marktplatz, next to the ''Marienkapelle'', with its ornate stucco façade, is an achievement of the Würzburg Rococo period. In the past, it served as an inn, and today it houses a public library and the tourist information office.<ref name="Dumont"/>{{rp|62}}
*The ''Stift Haug'' (formally the ''Stiftskirche St. Johannis im Haug'', dedicated to [[John the Baptist]] and [[John the Evangelist]]) was built in the years 1670–1691 as the first Baroque church in Franconia. It was designed by Antonio Petrini. The former church had been demolished as it was in the way of new city fortifications built by [[Johann Philipp von Schönborn]]. In 1945 most of the church's interior was destroyed. Works of art include a [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] by [[Tintoretto]] loaned by the [[Bavarian State Painting Collections]].<ref name="Dumont"/>{{rp|59–60}}
*The ''[[Würzburger Stein]]'' vineyard just outside the city is one of Germany's oldest and largest vineyards.
