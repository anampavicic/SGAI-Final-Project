== History ==
The name "Yatsushiro" is extremely ancient, and appears in the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' and other [[Nara period]] documents. It is said to have been derived from a mountain shrine believed to have been the tomb of [[Amaterasu]]. In the Nara and Heian periods, it was a center for trade with [[Baekje]] and [[Song China]]. During the [[Sengoku period]], the area was contested between the [[Nawa clan|Nawa]], [[Sagara clan|Sagara]], [[Shimazu clan|Shimazu]] and other warlords before coming under the control of [[Konishi Yukinaga]] under the time of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. Konishi built [[Mugishima Castle]] in 1588 as a new base for ruling Yatsushiro. After the 1600 [[Battle of Sekigahara]], [[Kato Kiyomasa]], the lord of [[Kumamoto Castle]], became the ruler of [[Higo Province]]. Mugishima Castle was an exception to the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]'s "One Castle per Province" order of 1615 and remained a secondary castle under [[Kumamoto Domain]] until its destruction by earthquake in 1619. [[Yatsushiro Castle]] was constructed as its replacement. After the [[Hosokawa clan]] took control of Higo Province, the castle became the stronghold of their 30,000 ''[[koku]]'' ''[[karō]]'', the Matsue clan, who controlled the [[jōkamachi|castle town]] to the end of the Edo period. The town of Yatsushiro was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. On September 1, 1940 Yatsushiro annexed the town of Otago, and villages of Ueyanagi, and Matsutaka and was raised to city status. The city continues to expand in the 1950s and 1960 by annexing neighboring villages. 

On August 1, 2005, Yatsushiro absorbed the towns of [[Kagami, Kumamoto|Kagami]] and [[Senchō, Kumamoto|Senchō]], and the villages of [[Izumi, Kumamoto|Izumi]], [[Sakamoto, Kumamoto|Sakamoto]] and [[Tōyō, Kumamoto|Tōyō]] (all from [[Yatsushiro District, Kumamoto|Yatsushiro District]]) to create the new and expanded city of Yatsushiro.

==Government==
Yatsushiro has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 32 members. Yatsushiro, collectively with the town of Hikawa, contributes four members to the Kumamoto Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the [[Kumamoto 4th district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

== Economy ==
Traditionally, the Yatsushiro Plain is a major producer of rice and [[Juncus effusus|''igusa'']], which is the raw material for ''[[tatami]]'' mats. Agriculture remains a major component of the local economy. The ''[[banpeiyu]]'' fruit bears a resemblance to hugely oversized grapefruits. [[Karashi|''Karashi Renkon'']] is a specialty which is a [[lotus root]] stuffed with a mustard-like sauce called ''karashi'' and coated with egg. ''[[Basashi]]'' is raw horse meat and is considered a delicacy within Japan. It is often served with onion and ginger. Basashi burgers can be found at hamburger restaurants.

In the Meiji era, Yatsushiro Port was developed as a modern port, and in 1890, Kyushu's first cement factory was built there. Local industries include pulp and paper, brewing and food processing.

==Education==
Yatsushiro has 23 public elementary schools and 15 public junior high schools operated by the city government and one junior high school and five public high schools operated by the Kumamoto Prefectural Board of Education. The prefecture also operates two special education schools for the handicapped. [[Nakakyushu Junior College]] is a private junior college located in Yatsushiro.
