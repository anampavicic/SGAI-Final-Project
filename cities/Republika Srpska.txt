'''Republika Srpska''' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Република Српска}}, {{IPA|sh|repǔblika sr̩̂pskaː|pron|RepublikaSrpska.ogg}}, also known as the '''Republic of Srpska''') is one of the two [[Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina|entities]] of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the other being the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It is located in the northern and eastern parts of the country and had a population of 1,228,423 according to the 2013 census.<ref name="census2013" /> The largest city and administrative center is [[Banja Luka]], situated on the [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas River]].

Republika Srpska was founded in 1992 at the outset of the [[Bosnian War]] with the declared aim of protecting the interests of the [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The war led to the [[Ethnic cleansing in the Bosnian War|expulsion]] of the vast majority of [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Croats]] and [[Bosniaks]] from areas under Republika Srpska’s control, while many Serbs were expelled from the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] to Republika Srpska. Following the 1995 [[Dayton Agreement]], Republika Srpska was officially recognized as one of the two entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Today, it is home to the majority of Bosnia and Herzegovina's Serb population.

Republika Srpska operates under a parliamentary system, with legislative authority vested in the [[National Assembly (Republika Srpska)|National Assembly]], which comprises 83 seats. The entity is relatively centralized, although it is divided into 64 municipalities, known as ''[[Municipalities of Republika Srpska|opštine]]'' (singular: ''opština'').<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17211415 |title=Bosnia-Herzegovina profile |work=BBC News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411171804/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17211415 |archive-date=11 April 2013 |url-status=live |access-date=14 April 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The current legislative session is the tenth since the entity’s establishment.

In the name ''{{lang|sr-Latn|Republika Srpska}}'', ''{{lang|sr-Latn|[[wiktionary:Srpska|Srpska]]}}'' is a [[noun]] [[Morphological derivation|derived]] from the [[ethnonym]] of the [[Serbs]] with a different [[suffix]] than ''{{lang|sr-Latn|Srbija}}'' ‘[[Serbia]]’. In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], many [[List of country-name etymologies|names of countries]] are formed with the ''{{lang|sr-Latn|[[wiktionary:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/-ьskъ|-sk-]]}}'' suffix (e.g. ''{{lang|sr-Latn|[[:sr:Бугарска|Bugarska]]}}'' ‘Bulgaria’, ''{{lang|sr-Latn|[[:sr:Данска|Danska]]}}'' ‘Denmark’, ''{{lang|sr-Latn|[[:sr:Финска|Finska]]}}'' ‘Finland’, ''{{lang|sr-Latn|[[:sr:Хрватска|Hrvatska]]}}'' ‘Croatia’, ''{{lang|sr-Latn|[[:sr:Република Ирска|Irska]]}}'' ‘Ireland’, ''{{lang|sr-Latn|[[:sr:Турска|Turska]]}}'' ‘Turkey’).

[[File:NHM - Bandin Fahrzeug mit Vögeln.jpg|thumb|left|Iron Age cult carriage from Banjani near Sokolac]]
Archaeological evidence in Republika Srpska, as well as bordering areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina, attest to pronounced human activity in the [[Paleolithic]]. Specifically, in 1976, near the modern-day town of [[Stolac]] in the then relatively hospitable [[Neretva|Neretva basin]], archaeological artifacts in the form of cave engravings in [[Badanj Cave|Badanj]] and deer bones in the area were discovered to show hunter-gatherer activity from as far back as 14,000–10,000 BC.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://stolac.gov.ba/index.php/turizam-i-kultura/znamenitosti/badanj |title=Službene stranice Općine Stolac – Badanj – paleolitsko nalazište|website=stolac.gov.ba |access-date=2019-04-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914042100/http://www.stolac.gov.ba/index.php/turizam-i-kultura/znamenitosti/badanj |archive-date=14 September 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Within the wider region of Herzegovina, similar discoveries tie the region's early activities to Montenegro and coastal Croatia.

With the Neolithic, however, came more permanent settlement. Naturally, this occurred along the rivers of Bosnia and Herzegovina as farming spread from the southeast; most notably, the [[Butmir culture]] developed near today's East Sarajevo on the river [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]]. A variety of idols, mostly of female character, were found in the Butmir site, along with dugouts.

With the [[Indo-European migrations]] of the [[Bronze Age]] came the first use of metal tools in the region. Along with this came the construction of burial mounds&mdash;[[Tumulus|tumuli]], or [[kurgan]]s. Remains of these mounds can be found in northwestern Bosnia near [[Prijedor]], testament to not only denser settlement in the northern core of today's Republika Srpska but also Bronze Age relics.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |last=Babaic |first=Haris |date=Spring 2019 |title=Prethistorija na tlu BiH |url=https://forzes.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/prethistorija-na-tlu-bih.doc}}</ref>

With the influx of the [[Iron Age]], the [[Glasinac culture]], developing near [[Sokolac]] in eastern Republika Srpska, was one of the most important of the country's long-standing Indo-European inhabitants, the [[Illyrians]]. Later, these Illyrians&mdash;the [[Autariatae]]&mdash;were influenced by the [[Celts]] after the [[Celtic settlement of Southeast Europe|Gallic invasion of the Balkans]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Illyrians |last=Wilkes |first=John |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=1996 |isbn=0-631-19807-5 |location=Oxford, United Kingdom}}</ref>

=== Roman period ===
[[File:Ancient balkans 4thcentury.png|thumb|right|Territory of Republika Srpska within the [[Roman Empire]], 4th century]]
With the end of the [[Illyrian Wars]], most of Bosnia and Herzegovina came under [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] control within the province of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]]. In this period, the Romans consolidated the region through the construction of a dense road network and the Romanisation of the local population. Among these roads was the ''Via Argentaria'', or 'Silver Way', which transported silver from the eastern mines of Bosnia to Roman population centres. Modern placenames, such as the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] and [[Sana (river)|Sana]] rivers in the northwest, have Latin origins, meaning "the one" and "the healthy", respectively. This rule was not uninterrupted, however; with the suppression of the once-dominant Illyrian population came revolts such as the [[Bellum Batonianum]]. After 20 AD, however, the entirety of the country was conquered by the Romans and it was split between [[Pannonia]] and [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]]. The most prominent Roman city in Bosnia was the relatively small [[Servitium]], near modern-day [[Gradiška, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Gradiška]] in the northern part of the entity.

Christianity spread to the region relatively late at least partially due to the countryside's mountainous nature and its lack of large settlements. In the fourth century, however, the country began to be [[Christianised]] en masse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diercke.com/kartenansicht.xtp?artId=978-3-14-100790-9&seite=22&id=17448&kartennr=1 |title=The spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire |last=Lückemeier |first=K. |website=Diercke |access-date=8 April 2019}}</ref> With the split of the Western and Eastern Roman Empires in 395, modern-day Republika Srpska fell under the Western Roman Empire. Testament to its and Bosnia and Herzegovina's later religious polarisation, it was later conquered as a frontier of the Eastern Roman Empire, a harbinger for religious division to come.

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Тврђава Кастел 2.jpg|thumb|[[Kastel Fortress]] in Banja Luka, first appearing as an early Slavic [[hillfort]] or ''gradina'']]
With the loosening of Roman grip on the region came the [[Migration Period]] which, given Republika Srpska's position in southeastern Europe, involved a wide variety of peoples. Among the first was the invasion of Germanic peoples from the east and north, and the territory became a part of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] in 476.

By 535, the territory was taken once again by the Byzantine Empire. At this time, the Empire's grip was once again relatively loose and Slavs invaded the surrounding area. Modern-day Republika Srpska was therefore split between the mediaeval [[Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)|Kingdom of Croatia]]<ref name="Larousse">{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Grand Larousse encyclopédique |trans-title=Larousse online encyclopedia |url=http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/pays/Croatie/115207#395864 |article=Histoire de la Croatie |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327102048/https://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/pays/Croatie/115207#395864 |archive-date=27 March 2019 |quote=Liée désormais à la Hongrie par une union personnelle, la Croatie, pendant huit siècles, formera sous la couronne de saint Étienne un royaume particulier ayant son ban et sa diète. |lang=fr}}</ref> and, according to [[De Administrando Imperio]], [[Serbia in the Middle Ages|mediaeval Serbian]] ''[[župan]]ije'', including, [[Bosna (region)|Bosna]], [[Zachlumia]], [[Travunija]], and Serbia, then including land in eastern Bosnia.<ref>Moravcsik (1967)</ref> Parts of present-day Srpska were locations of settlement of the original [[White Serbs|White Serb]] people.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ćirković |first1=Sima M. |title=Srbi među europskim narodima |date=2008 |publisher=Golden Marketing-Tehnička Knjiga |isbn=978-9532123388 |pages=26–27 |url=http://www.mo-vrebac-pavlovac.hr/attachments/article/451/Sima%20%C4%86irkovi%C4%87%th20SRBI%20ME%C4%90U%20EVROPSKIM%20NARODIMA.pdf|access-date=26 October 2020}}</ref>

By the end of the 11th century, the entirety of Bosnia became part of the [[Hungarian Crown Lands]]. Under Hungarian rule the area was known as the [[Banate of Bosnia]]. Later, however, with the rule of [[Ban Kulin]], who is regarded as the founder of Bosnia, the region became ''de facto'' independent. In 1377, the Banate of Bosnia became the medieval Kingdom of Bosnia, under [[Tvrtko I]] of [[House of Kotromanić]]. The capitals of the kingdom were all located in its centre, while the northern periphery remained under nominal Hungarian rule as the region of [[Usora (province)|Usora]]. Architectural legacies from this period include [[Kastel Fortress]] in Banja Luka, the fortress of [[Doboj]] as well as castles, churches, and monasteries across the country.

With the growth of the Ottoman Empire, [[Stefan Tomašević]], the last [[Kotromanić dynasty|Kotromanić]] ruler, surrendered Bosnia and Serbia to Ottoman tributary status. A Catholic, he was unpopular among the Orthodox population of Serbia, as well as the members of the [[Bosnian Church]].<ref>Ćirković (1964) p.276</ref> Refusing to pay tribute to [[Mehmed the Conqueror]], King Stefan was executed and much of Bosnia fell under direct [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule in 1463 as the [[Bosnia Eyalet|Eyalet of Bosnia]]. The entirety of the country fell in 1482, with the founding of the [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]].

[[File:Mehmet pasa bridge and green Drina river.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge]], a [[List of World Heritage Sites in Bosnia and Herzegovina|UNESCO World Heritage Site]], in [[Višegrad]], founded by Ottoman Grand vizier of Serb origin [[Sokollu Mehmed Pasha]]]]
Ottoman rule in modern-day Republika Srpska saw another addition to its religious fabric&mdash;Islam. Members of the Bosnian Church, as well as many Orthodox and Catholic Bosnians, gradually converted to Islam. Ottoman rule left a profound architectural legacy in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska. The most famous mosque from this period is the [[Ferhat Pasha Mosque (Banja Luka)|Ferhadija mosque]], located in [[Banja Luka]]. In addition, the subject of [[Ivo Andrić]]'s book ''[[The Bridge on the Drina]],'' [[Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge]] in [[Višegrad]], was constructed by [[Mimar Sinan]], the most famous Ottoman architect, in 1577, for [[Grand vizier|Grand Vizier]] [[Sokollu Mehmed Pasha]]. Years earlier, the same Grand Vizier was born into an [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] family in a small town in Bosnia and taken from his parents as a child for upbringing as a [[Janissaries|janissary]]. His bridge is a symbol of the religious and cultural spans&mdash;and eventually conflict&mdash;that characterise Republika Srpska and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

With the [[Ottoman–Habsburg wars|Ottoman-Habsburg]] conflicts of the late 17th and 18th centuries, parts of northern Republika Srpska became a part of the Habsburg Empire for relatively short periods of time. Rule was more permanent following Austro-Hungarian invasion in 1878. Characterised by economic and social development not seen in the by-then backwards Ottoman Empire, [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Austro-Hungarian rule]] was welcomed by many. However, many Muslims left Bosnia, leaving Serbs as the majority in the entirety of the [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Condominium]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Religious Separation and Political Intolerance in Bosnia-Herzegovina |last=Velikonja |first=Mitja |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |year=2003 |isbn=1-58544-226-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/religiousseparat0000veli/page/130 130]–135 |url=https://archive.org/details/religiousseparat0000veli|url-access=registration}}</ref>

With the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], carried out by Bosnian Serb [[Gavrilo Princip]], a member of the [[Yugoslavism|Yugoslavist]] [[Young Bosnia|Mlada Bosna]], World War I broke out in 1914. Following the war, the territory of modern-day Republika Srpska was incorporated into the [[Vrbas Banovina|Vrbas]], [[Drina Banovina|Drina]], and [[Zeta Banovina|Zeta]] [[Banovinas of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|banovinas]] of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, renamed Yugoslavia in 1929.

Following the outbreak of [[World War II]] and the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in 1941, modern-day Republika Srpska fell under the rule of the Nazi [[puppet state]], The [[Independent State of Croatia]].

After World War II came a period of relative peace and economic development. [[Ljubija mine]] and companies like [[Agrokomerc]] played a vital role in much of the economic development of the [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Literacy rates increased greatly, and the University of Banja Luka was founded in 1975.

Representatives of main political parties and some other national organisations and institutions of [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Serb people in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] met on 13 October 1990 in [[Banja Luka]] and formed the 'Serbian National Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina' as a Serb political body.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7g4UAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Serbian+National+Council+of+Bosnia%22 |via=Google Books |title=Foreign Broadcast Information Service Daily Reports: Eastern Europe |year=1990 |pages=58–59 |publisher=Serbian National Council of Bosnia |access-date=7 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181209123751/https://books.google.rs/books?id=7g4UAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Serbian+National+Council+of+Bosnia%22 |archive-date=9 December 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In a session on 14–15 October 1991, the [[People's Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], then part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], approved the 'Memorandum on Sovereignty', as had already been done by [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]], as a way to proclaim independence from the rest of Yugoslavia.

On 24 October 1991, the Serb deputies formed the [[National Assembly of Republika Srpska|Assembly of the Serb People in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (''Skupština srpskog naroda u Bosni i Hercegovini'') to be the highest representative and legislative body of the [[Bosnian Serb]] population,<ref name=OG1.1>{{cite press release |date=15 January 1992 |title=The Decision on Establishment of the Assembly of the Serb People in Bosnia and Herzegovina |publisher=Official Bulletin of the Serb People in Bosnia and Herzegovina |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=1 |language=sr}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_RSi4WL0RP8C&pg=PA12 |title=Women, violence, and war: Wartime ... |access-date=29 August 2010 |isbn=978-963-9116-60-3 |year=2000 |last1=Nikoli?-Ristanovi? |first1=Vesna|publisher=Central European University Press }}</ref> ending the tripartite coalition.

The Union of Reform Forces soon ceased to exist but its members remained in the assembly as the [[Independent Members of Parliament Caucus]]. The assembly undertook to address the achievement of equality between the Serbs and other peoples and the protection of the Serbs' interests, which they contended had been jeopardised by decisions of the Bosnian parliament.<ref name=OG1.1 /> On 9 January 1992, the assembly proclaimed the Republic of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina ({{lang|sr-Latn|Republika srpskoga naroda Bosne i Hercegovine}}), declaring it part of Yugoslavia.<ref>{{cite press release |date=27 January 1992 |title=The Declaration of Proclamation of the Republic of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina |publisher=Official Bulletin of the Serb People in Bosnia and Herzegovina |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=13–14 |language=sr}}</ref>

On 28 February 1992, the assembly adopted the [[Constitution of Republika Srpska|Constitution of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (the name adopted instead of the previous ''Republika srpskog naroda Bosne i Hercegovine''), which would include districts, municipalities, and regions where Serbs were the majority and also those where they had allegedly become a minority because of [[World War II persecution of Serbs|persecution during World War II]].

The Bosnian parliament, without its Serb deputies, held a [[referendum]] on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 29 February and 1 March 1992, but most Serbs boycotted it since the assembly had previously (9–10 November 1991) held a [[plebiscite]] in the Serb regions, 96% having opted for membership of the Yugoslav federation formed by [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]].<ref name=Kreca>{{cite report |author=Kreća, Milenko |date=11 July 1996 |chapter=The Legality of the Proclamation of Bosnia and Herzegovina's Independence in Light of the Internal Law of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia <!-- |alt-title=The Legality of the Proclamation of Independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Light of International Law --> |chapter-url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/91/7365.pdf?PHPSESSID=1f1615e6112c0279dde6f359b53b0659 |title=Dissenting Opinion of Judge Kreća |type=PDF |series=Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J.

===Impact of war===
The [[Bosnian War|war in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] resulted in major changes in the country, some of which were quantified in a 1998 [[UNESCO]] report. Some two million people, about half the country's population, were displaced. In 1996 there were some 435,346 ethnic Serb refugees from the Federation in Republika Srpska, while another 197,925 had gone to Serbia. In 1991, 27% of the non-agricultural labour force was unemployed in Bosnia and this number increased due to the war.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/education/educprog/erd/english/com/docs/eur/bih2/srp_cont.html |author=UNESCO |title=Review of the education system in the Republika Srpska |year=1998 |access-date=10 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207000927/http://www.unesco.org/education/educprog/erd/english/com/docs/eur/bih2/srp_cont.html |archive-date=7 December 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref> By 2009, the unemployment rate in Bosnia and Herzegovina was estimated at 29%, according to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s ''[[The World Factbook]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/bosnia-and-herzegovina/ |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |place=Dulles, VA |website=cia.gov |access-date=8 April 2015}}</ref> Republika Srpska's population of Serbs had increased by 547,741 due to the influx of ethnic Serb refugees from the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the former unrecognised state of the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] in the new [[Republic of Croatia]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://pressrs.ba/sr/vesti/vesti_dana/story/9058/Od+pola+miliona,+u+FBiH+ostalo+50.000+Srba.html |newspaper=Press Online Republika Srpska (pressrs.ba) |title=Od pola miliona, u FBiH ostalo 50.000 Srba |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202101903/http://pressrs.ba/sr/vesti/vesti_dana/story/9058/Od+pola+miliona%2C+u+FBiH+ostalo+50.000+Srba.html |archive-date=2 February 2012 |access-date=8 April 2015}}</ref>
[[File:Memorijalni centar Srebrenica-Potočari.JPG|thumb|right|[[Srebrenica Genocide Memorial]]]]

In Eastern Bosnia, Bosnian Serbs besieged the town of Srebrenica, among others. Srebrenica was declared a UN 'Safe Area' in 1993 and it served as an enclave for Bosniak refugees for the final years of the Bosnian War. In the middle of July 1995, more than 8,000 Muslim [[Bosniaks]], mainly men and boys, in and around the town of [[Srebrenica]], were killed in what became known as the [[Srebrenica massacre]], which was subsequently designated as an act of [[genocide]] by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] and the [[International Court of Justice]].

Acts of [[ethnic cleansing]] against the non-Serb populations reduced the numbers of other groups.

In the early 2000s, discrimination against non-Serbs was alleged by NGOs and the [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|Helsinki Commission]]. The [[International Crisis Group]] reported in 2002 that in some parts of Republika Srpska a non-Serb returnee is ten times more likely to be the victim of violent crime than a local Serb.<ref>{{cite report |date=13 December 2002 |title=The Continuing Challenge of Refugee Return in Bosnia & Herzegovina |publisher=Crisis Group |url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=1473&l=1 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419161757/http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?l=1&id=1473 |archive-date=19 April 2009 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Helsinki Commission, in a 2001 statement on 'Tolerance and Non-Discrimination', pointed at violence against non-Serbs, stating that in the cities of [[Banja Luka]]<ref>{{cite news |date=8 May 2001 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1318283.stm |title=UN Condemns Serb 'Sickness' |work=BBC News |access-date=4 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023232223/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1318283.stm |archive-date=23 October 2007 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref> and [[Trebinje]],<ref>{{cite news |date=6 May 2001 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1315262.stm |title=Serbs block Bosnia mosque ceremony |work=BBC News |access-date=4 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108081952/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1315262.stm |archive-date=8 November 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref> mobs attacked people who sought to lay foundations for new [[mosque]]s.

Organisations such as the [[Society for Threatened Peoples]], reporting to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] in 2008, have made claims of discrimination against non-Serb refugees in Republika Srpska, particularly areas with high unemployment in the Drina Valley such as [[Srebrenica]], [[Bratunac]], [[Višegrad]], and [[Foča]].<ref>{{cite press release |date=21 February 2008 |title=7th Session of the UN Human Rights Council |publisher=Society for Threatened Peoples |page=2 |url=http://forum-menschenrechte.de/cms/upload/PDF/ab_05-2008/aides_memoires/Bosnia_Herzegowina-GfbV.pdf |access-date=12 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719021433/http://forum-menschenrechte.de/cms/upload/PDF/ab_05-2008/aides_memoires/Bosnia_Herzegowina-GfbV.pdf |archive-date=19 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Republika Srpska|Constitution of Republika Srpska}}
[[File:Стари Дом војске, Краља Алфонса ХIII 3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[National Assembly (Republika Srpska)|National Assembly of Republika Srpska]] in [[Banja Luka]]]]
According to [[Constitution of Republika Srpska|its constitution]], Republika Srpska has its own president, legislature (the 83-member unicameral [[National Assembly (Republika Srpska)|National Assembly of Republika Srpska]]), executive government, [[Police of Republika Srpska|police force]], court system, customs service (under the state-level customs service), and postal service. It also has official symbols, including a coat of arms, a flag (a variant of the [[Flag of Serbia|Serbian flag]] without the coat of arms displayed) and its entity anthem. The Constitutional Law on the Coat of Arms and Anthem of Republika Srpska was ruled not in concordance with the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina as it states that those symbols 'represent the statehood of Republika Srpska' and are used 'in accordance with moral norms of the Serb people'. According to the Constitutional Court's decision, the Law was to be corrected by September 2006. Republika Srpska later changed its emblem.

Although the constitution names [[Sarajevo]] as the capital of Republika Srpska, the northwestern city of [[Banja Luka]] is the headquarters of most of the institutions of government, including the parliament, and is, therefore, the ''de facto'' capital. After the war, Republika Srpska retained its army, but in August 2005, the parliament consented to transfer control of [[Army of Republika Srpska]] to a state-level ministry and abolish the entity's defence ministry and army by 1 January 2006. These reforms were required by [[NATO]] as a precondition of Bosnia and Herzegovina's admission to the [[Partnership for Peace]] programme. Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the programme in December 2006.<ref>{{cite web |title=Signatures of Partnership for Peace Framework Document |url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_82584.htm |publisher=[[NATO]] |access-date=5 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311063625/http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_82584.htm |archive-date=11 March 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In July 2023, legislation was passed to criminalise insult and defamation with up to 10 years in prison. This is likely to jeopardize freedom of speech and silence critics. Critics have said that this could make the Republika Srpska an authoritarian regime.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bosnian Serb Autonomous Region Reinstates Insult and Defamation in Criminal Code |url=https://www.occrp.org/en/daily/17857-bosnian-serb-autonomous-region-reinstates-insult-and-defamation-in-criminal-code |date=21 July 2023}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Orlovačko jezero na Zelengori, nacionalni park Sutjeska.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Orlovačko Lake]] located in [[Sutjeska National Park]]]]
Situated in [[Southeast Europe]], Republika Srpska is located on the [[Balkan Peninsula]], with its northern extents reaching into the [[Pannonian Basin]]. Republika Srpska lies between latitudes [[41st parallel north|42°]] and [[47th parallel north|46° N]] and longitudes [[13th meridian east|16°]] and [[20° E]]. The entity is split into two main parts by the Brčko District; a hilly western part and a more varied eastern part, with high mountains in the south and flat, fertile farmland in the north. Republika Srpska, unlike its counterpart entity, is landlocked.

Like the rest of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska is split into a [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnian]] region in the north and a [[Herzegovina|Herzegovinian]] region in the far south. Within these two macroregions exist smaller geographical regions, from the forested hills of [[Bosanska Krajina]] in the northwest to the fertile plains of [[Semberija]] in the northeast.

Republika Srpska covers {{convert|24816.2|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}}, excluding the Brčko District, which is held in [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] by both entities, but is ''[[de facto]]'' sovereign within Bosnia and Herzegovina. Republika Srpska, if it were a country, would be 146th largest in the world. Elevation varies greatly, with [[Maglić (mountain)|Maglić]], a peak in the Dinaric Alps near Montenegro, reaching {{Convert|2386|m}}, and parts nearer the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] going down to sea level. The largest and most popular ski resort in Bosnia and Herzegovina is situated on the slopes of the mountain [[Jahorina]], in the eastern part of the entity.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.skiresort.info/ski-resort/jahorina/ |title=Jahorina ski resort |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411125959/https://www.skiresort.info/ski-resort/jahorina/ |archive-date=11 April 2019 |url-status=live |access-date=9 April 2019 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Other major mountains in Republika Srpska include [[Volujak (mountain)|Volujak]], [[Zelengora]], [[Lelija]], [[Lebršnik]], [[Crvanj]], [[Orjen]], [[Klekovača]], [[Vitorog]], [[Kozara]], [[Romanija]], [[Treskavica]] and [[Trebević]].

===Boundary===
Republika Srpska shares international borders with [[Croatia]] to the north, [[Serbia]] to the east, and [[Montenegro]] to the southeast. Within Bosnia and Herzegovina, the [[Inter-Entity Boundary Line|Inter-Entity Boundary Line (IEBL)]] marks Republika Srpska's administrative division with the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and essentially follows the front lines at the end of the [[Bosnian War]] with some adjustments (most importantly in the western part of the country and around Sarajevo) as defined by the [[Dayton Agreement]]. The total length of the IEBL is approximately {{formatnum:1080}} km. The IEBL is an administrative demarcation uncontrolled by military or police and there is free movement across it.<ref>{{cite book |title=Building Democracy from the Outside: the Dayton Agreement in Bosnia and Herzegovina |last=Cox |first=Marcus |publisher=Zed Books |year=2003 |isbn=1-84277-150-7 |location=London |pages=253–276}}</ref>

=== Forests ===
Republika Srpska is one of the most forested areas in Europe, with over 50% of its area consisting of forest cover. [[Perućica]] is one of the last [[old-growth forest]]s in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.npsutjeska.net/stranica.php?id=8&naziv=perucica&jez=en |title=Perućica official website |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723022258/http://www.npsutjeska.net/stranica.php?id=8&naziv=perucica&jez=en |archive-date=23 July 2015 |website=npsutjeska.net |access-date=24 November 2015}}</ref>

Two densely-wooded national parks—[[Sutjeska National Park]] and [[Kozara National Park]]—are located in the entity.

Most rivers belong to the [[Black Sea]] drainage basin. The principal rivers are the [[Sava]], a tributary of the [[Danube]] that forms the northern boundary with [[Croatia]]; the [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]], [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]], [[Sana (river)|Sana]] and [[Una (Sava)|Una]], which all flow north and empty into the Sava; the [[Drina]], which flows north and forms a significant part of the eastern boundary with [[Serbia]], and is also a tributary of the Sava. The [[Trebišnjica]] is one of the longest [[sinking river]]s in the world. It belongs to the [[Adriatic Sea]] drainage basin. [[Skakavac Waterfall, Perućica|Skakavac Waterfall]] on the [[Perućica]] is one of the highest waterfalls in the country, at about {{convert|75|m|ft|abbr=off}} in height. The most important lakes are [[Bileća Lake]], [[Lake Bardača]] (which includes a protected wetland area) and [[Balkana Lake]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Krejic |first=Ljiljana |date=2017-09-26 |title=Endangered wetlands of Bardača Nature Park |url=https://www.itinari.com/endangered-wetlands-of-bardaca-nature-park-p3lb |access-date=2022-12-13 |website=itinari |language=en}}</ref>

=== Education ===
[[File:Univerzitetska_zgrada,_Pale_05.jpg|thumb|right|[[University of East Sarajevo]], in [[Pale, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Pale]]]]
Literacy in Republika Srpska stands at 96.8 percent as of 2013. Free primary education is provided as a right to all people in Republika Srpska and Bosnia and Herzegovina. There are 187 primary schools in addition to 11 music schools and 4 centres of education for students with learning disabilities. Secondary education exists in three main channels: three-year [[vocational school]]s, four-year technical schools, and four-year [[grammar school]]s (''gimnazije''). Ten independent grammar schools exist, while an additional 30 are integrated into other schools. Music schools offer another option for students to continue their education following primary school.

The oldest and largest [[public university]] in Republika Srpska is the [[University of Banja Luka]], which was established in 1975.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unibl.org/en/university/about-the-university |title=About the University |publisher=University of Belgrade (UNIBL) |department=Computing Centre, School of Electrical Engineering |website=www.unibl.org |language=en |access-date=2018-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629155253/http://www.unibl.org/en/university/about-the-university |archive-date=29 June 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The second of two public universities in Republika Srpska is [[University of East Sarajevo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kultor.org/organization/university-of-east-sarajevo/ |publisher=University of East Sarajevo |title=Rethinking the Culture of Tolerance |year=2016 |website=kultor.org |language=en-US |access-date=2018-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508185825/http://kultor.org/organization/university-of-east-sarajevo/ |archive-date=8 May 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref> After the end of the [[Yugoslav wars]] several private institutions of higher education were established, including: [[American University in Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Slobomir University]], {{ill|Pan-European University “APEIRON”|sr|Паневропски универзитет Апеирон}} and [[University Sinergija]].

===Representative offices===
[[File:Представништва Републике Српске у свијету.PNG|thumb|right|Representative offices of Republika Srpska worldwide]]
In February 2009, Republika Srpska opened a representative office in [[Brussels]]. While [[European Union]] representatives were not present at the ceremony, top Republika Srpska officials attended the event, saying it would advance their economic, political and cultural relations with the EU. This notion has been strongly condemned by Bosniak leaders, saying that this is further proof of Republika Srpska distancing itself from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The president of Republika Srpska, [[Rajko Kuzmanović]], told reporters that this move did not jeopardise Republika Srpska's place within [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. He added that Republika Srpska merely used its constitutional right 'to open up a representation office in the centre of developments of European relevance'. Republika Srpska maintains official offices in [[Belgrade]], [[Moscow]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Thessaloniki]], [[Washington D.C.]], [[Brussels]], and [[Vienna]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vladars.net/sr-SP-Cyrl/Vlada/Predstavnistva/Pages/default.aspx |script-title=sr:Представништва Републике Српске у иностранству |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424083407/http://www.vladars.net/sr-SP-Cyrl/Vlada/Predstavnistva/Pages/default.aspx |archive-date=24 April 2012 |website=vladars.net |access-date=31 October 2015 |language=sr}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biznis.ba/politika/15405-u-becu-otvoreno-predstavnistvo-republike-srpske.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723101017/http://www.biznis.ba/politika/15405-u-becu-otvoreno-predstavnistvo-republike-srpske.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 July 2012 |title=U Beču otvoreno Predstavništvo Republike Srpske |website=biznis.ba |access-date=3 August 2015 |language=sr}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smedia.rs/vesti/vest/89244/Milorad-Dodik-Otvoreno-predstavnistvo-Republike-Srpske-u-Becu-Dodik-otvorio-predstavnistvo-Republike-Srpske-u-Becu.html |title=Dodik otvorio predstavništvo Republike Srpske u Beču |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521171634/http://www.smedia.rs/vesti/vest/89244/Milorad-Dodik-Otvoreno-predstavnistvo-Republike-Srpske-u-Becu-Dodik-otvorio-predstavnistvo-Republike-Srpske-u-Becu.html |archive-date=21 May 2013 |website=smedia.rs |access-date=3 August 2015 |language=sr}}</ref>
