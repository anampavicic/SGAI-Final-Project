==History==
The first settlement of ancient hunters and fishermen in this location dates back to the 6th–8th millennia BCE, i.e., in the late [[Stone Age]]. In the 8th–9th centuries, first [[Slavs|Slavic tribes]] ([[Vyatichi]] and [[Krivichs]]) began settling here. In and around Mytishchinsky District about a dozen of such settlements from the 11th–13th centuries have been discovered.

The modern settlement has been known as the village ''Mystiche'' since 1460, and '''Bolshiye Mytishchi''' ({{lang|ru|Большие Мытищи}})<ref>{{Cite web |title=LUNA - Workspace |url=https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/workspace;JSESSIONID=8227735a-0a53-4627-bd87-714727970459?sip0=,RUMSEY~8~1~325279~90094240,542,118,640,827,1723,969,11528,12824,22484,29102,1&xwr=16&ywr=9 |access-date=2022-05-11 |website=davidrumsey.com}}</ref> since the 19th century. The name comes from the so-called mytnaya (or "myta") duty that was levied on merchants hauling ships (by wheels, rollers or skids) between the [[Yauza River|Yauza]] and [[Klyazma|Klyazma Rivers]], collected at the place now known as ''Yauza mytishche''. The word "Mytische" is a portmanteau of ''myt'' ({{lang|ru|мыт}}а) and a place where there was a residential building with a kiln and a hearth.

In 1804, the [[Mytishchi#Architecture|Mytishchi-Moscow aqueduct]] was built by order of [[Catherine the Great]]. It was the first water supply constructed in Russia to provide the Kremlin with pure water.

The first enterprises were organized in Mytischi in the middle of the 19th Century. Mytischi station, on the Moscow-Yaroslavl railway, opened in 1861, SI Mamontov's car building plant opened in 1896, and Viskova, Russia's first artificial silk company, began work in 1908. Mytischi and its district became a popular summer retreat for Russian holidaymakers from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, .

Mytischi gained city status on August 17, 1925.

In 1932, the territory of the city was significantly expanded, according to the decree of the Presidium of the Moscow Regional Executive Committee No. 8 (minutes No. 56) of October 4, 1932 and the decree of the Presidium of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of November 20, 1932 that approved it. The settlement merged with the villages of Bolshie Mytishchi, Rupasovo, Sharapovo, Zarechnaya Sloboda, Leonidovka, Perlovka, Taininsky settlements, Druzhba and Taininka.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/733323500 |title=Spravochnik po administrativno-territorialʹnomu delenii︠u︡ Moskovskoĭ oblasti 1929-2004 gg. |date=2011 |publisher=Kuchkovo Pole |others=G.
