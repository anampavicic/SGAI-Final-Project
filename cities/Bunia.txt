'''Bunia''' is the capital [[Cities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|city]] of [[Ituri Province]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC). It was part of the [[Orientale Province]] until that province's dissolution.<!-- pre-[http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_de_la_R%C3%A9publique_d%C3%A9mocratique_du_Congo 2006 constitution]). As of 2012 it had an estimated population of 366,126. --><ref>{{cite web|url=http://world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&men=gcis&lng=en&des=wg&srt=npan&col=abcdefghinoq&msz=1500&geo=-46 |title=Congo (Dem. Rep.): largest cities and towns and statistics of their population |publisher=World Gazetteer |access-date=January 21, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=July 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

It lies at an elevation of {{convert|1275|m|ft|-1|disp=or}} on a plateau about {{convert|30|km|mi|0|disp=or}} west of [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]] in the [[Albertine Rift]], and about {{convert|25|km|mi|0|disp=or}} east of the [[Ituri Rainforest]].

The city is at the center of the [[Ituri conflict]] between the [[Lendu]] and [[Hema people|Hema]]. In the [[Second Congo War]] the city and district were the scene of much fighting and many civilian deaths from this conflict, and related clashes between [[militia]]s and [[Uganda]]-based forces. Consequently, the city is the base of one of the largest [[MONUC|United Nations peace-keeping forces]] in Africa, and its headquarters in northeastern DRC. The area's natural resources include [[gold mine]]s over which militias and foreign forces have been fighting.

== Climate ==
Bunia has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Af'') with warm, humid and wet conditions prevailing year-round. Although rainfall is reduced substantially between December and February, those months still average over {{convert|130|mm|in|0|disp=or}} of rain. For the rest of the year, rainfall is very heavy with over {{convert|230|mm|in|1|disp=or}} for nine months of the year.

==Transport==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
The main dirt highways connecting north-eastern DR Congo with [[Kisangani]] to the west and [[Butembo]] and [[Goma]] to the south pass through Bunia, but have fallen into disrepair and are virtually impassable, especially after the frequent rains.

Bunia is only {{convert|40|km|mi|0|disp=or}} from the Ugandan border running down Lake Albert, but there are no road connections across the Great Rift Valley to the closest Ugandan towns of Toro and [[Fort Portal]]. Instead a dirt highway going north-east reaches [[Arua]] and [[Gulu]] north of the lake. Before the war made the route impassable, this was the chief trade route between the DRC and Uganda,  as well between the DRC and [[Juba, South Sudan|Juba]] in [[South Sudan]], and Bunia was an important market city, for cross-border trade as well as internal trade.

The supposed route of the [[Lagos-Mombasa Highway]] passes just to the south of Bunia, emphasising its potential as a centre of trade, but that transnational highway does not exist as a viable route through the DRC.

Bunia is linked to the small port of [[Kasenyi, Ituri|Kasenyi]] on Lake Albert by a {{convert|60|km|mi|0}} dirt track via Bogoro, which has a spectacular and dangerous 600-metre descent of the western escarpment of the Great Rift Valley. Kasenyi has a {{convert|155|m}} [[jetty]] from which boat transport can link with [[Mahagi-Port]] at the north end of the lake, and with [[Butiaba]] and [[Ntoroko]] on the Eastern Lake Albert Shore (Ugandan side) and [[Pakwach]] on the [[Albert Nile]].

Given the poor state of the roads, and the total lack of railway transport, [[Bunia Airport]] is of prime importance.

== Demographics ==
Projected to be the eighth fastest growing city on the African continent between 2020 and 2025, with a 5.63% growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranked-the-worlds-fastest-growing-cities/|publisher=virtual capitalist| access-date=2021-08-17|title=Ranked: The World's Fastest Growing Cities|date=13 August 2021| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210813174630/https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranked-the-worlds-fastest-growing-cities/|archive-date=13 August 2021}}</ref>

==Other features==
[[File:Over Bunia.jpg|thumb|300px|Bunia from the air.]]
Mount Hoyo is {{convert|35|km|mi|0|disp=or}} south-west of Bunia. The Shari River<!--not the Shari or Chari River in Chad previously linked from here--> flows along the northwestern outskirts of the city. The [[Ituri River]] flows around 35 km west of Bunia. The confluence of the Shari and Ituri is about {{convert|45|km|mi|0|disp=or}} south-southwest of Bunia.<ref>[http://earth.google.com Google Earth] —measurements and directions checked.</ref>

Although Bunia is about {{convert|170|km|mi|-1|disp=or}} north of the Equator, the city was featured in the [[BBC television]] travel documentary ''[[Equator (BBC TV series)|Equator]]'' made in 2006, since it was one of the few places near the Equator in eastern DRC where the safety of the TV crew could be assured, by the presence of the large UN peace-keeping force.

==Higher education==
Bunia has a number of universities, the largest being the University of Bunia (UNIBU) followed by the private [http://www.unishabunia.org Université Shalom de Bunia (USB)] which offers the largest library in Bunia (about 40,000 volumes) with an [http://biblio.unishabunia.org online catalog].
