Bilbao is also the main urban area in what is defined as the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Greater Basque region]].

Bilbao is located in the north-central part of Spain, some {{convert|16|km|mi|0}} south of the [[Bay of Biscay]], where the economic social development is located, where the [[estuary of Bilbao]] is formed. Its main urban core is surrounded by two small [[mountain range]]s with an average elevation of {{convert|400|m}}.<ref name="cadenas">[[#qui01|Quiroga 2001]]: 17</ref> Its climate is shaped by the Bay of Biscay low-pressure systems and mild air, moderating summer temperatures by [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] standards, with low sunshine and high rainfall. The annual temperature range is low for its latitude.

After its foundation in the late 13th century by [[Diego López V de Haro]], head of the powerful [[House of Haro|Haro]] family, Bilbao was one of the commercial hubs of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] that enjoyed significant importance in the [[Crown of Castile]]. This was due to its thriving [[Port of Bilbao|port activity]] based on the export of wool and iron commodities extracted from the Biscayan quarries to all over [[Europe]].

Throughout the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, Bilbao experienced heavy industrialisation, making it the centre of the second-most industrialised region of Spain, behind [[Barcelona]].<ref name="laria">[[#ria98|De La Puerta Rueda 1998]]: 73</ref><ref>[[#gom79|Gómez Piñeiro 1979]]: 169</ref> At the same time an extraordinary population explosion prompted the annexation of several adjacent municipalities.

==  Toponymy and symbols ==
The official name of the town is Bilbao, as known in most languages of the world. [[Euskaltzaindia]], the official regulatory institution of the [[Basque language]], has agreed that between the two possible names existing in Basque, ''Bilbao'' and ''Bilbo'', the historical name is ''Bilbo'', while ''Bilbao'' is the official name.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.euskaltzaindia.net/index.php?option=com_eoda&Itemid=191&lang=eu&view=frontpage | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090730011412/http://www.euskaltzaindia.net/index.php?option=com_eoda&Itemid=191&lang=eu&view=frontpage | url-status = dead | archive-date = 30 July 2009 | title = Euskal Onomastikaren Datutegia | publisher = [[Euskaltzaindia]] | access-date = 7 October 2010 | language = eu }}</ref> Although the term ''Bilbo'' does not appear in old documents, in the play ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]], there is a reference to swords presumably made of [[Biscay]]an iron which he calls "[[bilbo (sword)|bilboes]]", suggesting that it is a word used since at least the sixteenth century.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://gladius.revistas.csic.es/index.php/gladius/article/viewFile/90/91 | title = La producción de armas blancas en Bilbao durante el Siglo XVI | author = Dueñas Beraiz, Germán | publisher = Gladius XXI | year = 2001 | access-date = 19 July 2008 | archive-date = 24 January 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090124071948/http://gladius.revistas.csic.es/index.php/gladius/article/viewFile/90/91 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yT2YBt-iHgcC&q=bilbao&pg=PA51|title=Shakespeare's military language|access-date=10 April 2011|isbn=9780826477774|year=2004|last1=Edelman|first1=Charles|publisher=A&C Black |archive-date=17 February 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220217062409/https://books.google.com/books?id=yT2YBt-iHgcC&q=bilbao&pg=PA51|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[[#beas99|Beascoechea 1999]]: 138</ref><ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Bilbo |volume=3 |page=931}}</ref>

There is no consensus among historians about the origin of the name. Generally accepted accounts state that prior to the 12th century, the independent rulers of the territory, named Lords of Zubialdea, were also known as Lords of Bilbao la Vieja ("Old Bilbao"). The symbols of their patrimony are the tower and church used in the shield of Bilbao to this day.<ref>''Historia de Vizcaya a través de la prensa'', Volume 2</ref> One possible origin was suggested by the engineer [[Evaristo de Churruca y Brunet|Evaristo de Churruca]]. He said that it was a Basque custom to name a place after its location. For Bilbao this would be the result of the union of the Basque words for river and cove: ''Bil-Ibaia-Bao''.<ref name="etymology">[[#qui01|Quiroga 2001]]: 41</ref> The historian José Tussel Gómez argues that it is just a natural evolution of the Spanish words ''bello vado'', beautiful ford.<ref>[[#tus04|Tusell 2004]]: 22.</ref> On the other hand, according to the writer Esteban Calle Iturrino, the name derives from the two settlements that existed on both banks of the estuary, rather than from the estuary itself. The first, where the present [[Casco Viejo]] is located, would be called ''billa'', which means stacking in Basque, after the configuration of the buildings. The second, on the left bank, where now [[Bilbo Zarra|Bilbao La Vieja]] is located, would be called ''vaho'', Spanish for mist or steam. From the union of these two derives the name Bilbao,<ref name="etymology"/> which was also written as ''Bilvao'' and ''Biluao'', as documented in its [[municipal charter]].<ref>{{cite web | author = Adeliño Ortega, Charo | title = Carta Puebla | work = Bilbao 700 | page = 6 | url = http://www.periodistasvascos.com/imagenes/cap_1.pdf | access-date = 18 July 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080724095114/http://www.periodistasvascos.com/imagenes/cap_1.pdf | archive-date = 24 July 2008 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>
An ''-ao'' ending is also present in nearby [[Sestao]] and [[Ugao-Miraballes|Ugao]], that could be explained from Basque ''aho'', "mouth".

The titles, the flag and the coat of arms are Bilbao's traditional symbols and belong to its historic patrimony, being used in formal acts, for the identification and decoration of specific places or for the validation of documents.

=== Titles ===
Bilbao holds the historic category of township (''villa''), with the titles of "Very noble and very loyal and unbeaten" (''Muy Noble y Muy Leal e Invicta''). It was the [[Catholic Monarchs]] who awarded the title "Noble Town" (''Noble Villa'') on 20 September 1475.

=== Coat of arms ===
[[File:Escudo heráldico de Bilbao.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|The coat of arms of Bilbao]]
The [[coat of arms]] is [[blazon|emblazoned]] as follows:
{{blockquote|In a silver field a bridge with two eyes, added to the [[Church of Saint Anthony the Great|church of San Antón]] of its colour and to its sinister two sable wolves walking and in stick, on waves of azure and silver.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150603010831/http://www.bizkaia.net/udalnet/directorio_municipal/pdf/heral020.pdf Directory of municipal information.] Diputación de Vizcaya</ref>}}It has its origins in the 14th century and has remained with the same symbols since then, although its presentation has been adapted according to the destiny of the coat of arms. The durability of this shield is due to the representativeness of the symbols that appear. The navigable estuary and the stone bridge, prior to the founding of the town.  The wolves, typical of the coat of arms of the founder of the town in 1300, Diego López de Haro, son of Diego Lope Díaz de Haro (Lope comes from the Latin Lupus (wolf)) were added by the town council to represent the founder. Later, the fortress or castle that guarded the bridge was added and, when it was demolished in 1366, it was replaced by the temple of San Antón that was built in its place and inaugurated in 1433.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Basas |first=Manuel |url=https://www.bilbao.eus/bld/bitstream/handle/123456789/26356/06.pdf |title=Bilbao - Escudo de la Villa |location=Bilbao |pages=6 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Bilbao |chapter=El escudo de la villa de Bilbao}}</ref>

=== Flag ===
The flag that represents the city is white with a red block, in a ratio of three parts long by two wide. The colours red and white are the historical ones of the villa.

The Royal Order of 30 July 1845 determined the maritime password for the population. This was defined as a white flag with an upper red die next to the pod. The die should be square and the length of its side should equal half of the pod. Previously, at least since 1511, the banner that the '' Bilbao Consulate '' was wearing was white with a red [[Cross of Burgundy]]. The relationship of the town with the mercantile and marine activities was always very strong coming to share headquarters. In 1603 the new consistorial house is inaugurated and in it the headquarters of the city council and of the referred one '' Bilbao Consulate '' are located. The intimate relationship made the flag of the Consulate was related as a flag of the town by citizenship.

The definition of the maritime flag in 1845 was assumed by the population, who accepted it as their own, and so did the city council. At the inauguration of the Bilbao-Miranda de Ebro railway line, it was already used as a symbol of the town's representation, being permanently adopted in 1895 although no resolution has been adopted for this purpose.<ref>[http://www.elcorreodigital.com/vizcaya/20090503/vizcaya/bandera-nuestros-padres-20090503.html «Una bandera de nuestros padres.»] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506175515/http://www.elcorreodigital.com/vizcaya/20090503/vizcaya/bandera-nuestros-padres-20090503.html |date=6 May 2009 }} "El Correo".</ref>

Although it has always been assumed by the municipal institution and citizenship, at the beginning of the 20th century it was discussed in a municipal plenary session about the determination of a flag for the town. There was talk about "the use of the crimson colour of the [[Lordship of Biscay]], or of the [[Saltire|cross of Saint Andrew]]" but without reaching any resolution to the effect.<ref>[http://www.elcorreodigital.com/vizcaya/20090503/vizcaya/bandera-maritima-bilbao-20090503.html The maritime flag of Bilbao.

{{see also|Timeline of Bilbao}}

=== Prehistory ===
Remains of an ancient settlement were found on the top of Mount [[Malmasín]], dating from around the 3rd or 2nd century BC.<ref>{{cite web|author=Asociación de Periodistas de Vizcaya |title=Crónica de siete siglos |work=Bilbao 700 |page=24 |url=http://www.periodistasvascos.com/imagenes/cap_2.pdf |access-date=17 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724095226/http://www.periodistasvascos.com/imagenes/cap_2.pdf |archive-date=24 July 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="settlements">[[#san06|Sánchez-Beascoetxea 2006]]: 28</ref> Burial sites were also found on mounts Avril and Artxanda, dated 6,000 years old. Some authors identify the old settlement of Bilbao as ''Amanun Portus'', cited by [[Pliny the Elder]], or with ''Flaviobriga'', by [[Ptolemy]].<ref name="settlements"/>

=== Medieval Bilbao ===
[[File:Don Diego López de Haro V.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Statue of [[Diego López V de Haro]], founder of the city]]
Ancient walls, which date from around the 11th century, have been discovered below the [[Church of San Antón]].<ref name="settlements"/> Bilbao was one of the first towns founded in the fourteenth century, during a period in which approximately three-quarters of the [[Biscay]]an cities were developed, among them [[Portugalete]] in 1323, [[Ondarroa]] in 1327, [[Lekeitio]] in 1335, and [[Mungia]] and [[Larrabetzu]] in 1376.<ref>Gómez Piñeiro 1979: 96</ref> [[Diego López V de Haro]], then third [[Lordship of Biscay|Lord of Biscay]], founded Bilbao through a [[municipal charter]] dated in [[Valladolid]] on 15 June 1300 and confirmed by King [[Ferdinand IV of Castile]] in [[Burgos]], on 4 January 1301. Diego López established the new town on the right bank of the [[Nervión river]], on the grounds of the ''[[elizate]]'' of [[Begoña]] and granted it the ''[[fuero]]'' of [[Logroño]], a compilation of rights and privileges that would prove fundamental to its later development.<ref>[[#tus04|Tussel Gómez 2004]]: 19</ref>

In 1310 [[María Díaz I de Haro]], niece of Diego López V and Lady of Biscay, grants a new municipal charter to the city, which extends its commercial privileges even further, transforming the city in a mandatory stop for all the trade coming from [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] towards the sea. This second charter established that the road from [[Orduña-Urduña|Orduña]] to [[Bermeo]], at the time the most important trade route in the lordship, had to traverse the [[San Antón Bridge]] in Bilbao instead of the pass in [[Etxebarri]], as it did until then. This strengthened the position of Bilbao as a trading post, in detriment of Bermeo, city which until then had acted as the main port of the territory.<ref>MONTERO, Manuel. p. 11.</ref> In addition, Bilbao was granted exclusive rights to all trade between the city and [[Las Arenas]]. In 1372, [[John I of Castile]] strengthened even more the city's position by naming Bilbao a [[Free economic zone|free port]] and granting it special privileges concerning the trade of iron.<ref name="Privileges">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bilbao.net/cs/Satellite?c=Page&cid=1272986929362&language=es&pageid=1272986929362&pagename=BilbaoIzan%2FPage%2FBIZ_contenidoFinal |title=Brief History of the City (in Spanish) |access-date=17 August 2018 |archive-date=23 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923191654/http://www.bilbao.net/cs/Satellite?c=Page&cid=1272986929362&language=es&pageid=1272986929362&pagename=BilbaoIzan%2FPage%2FBIZ_contenidoFinal |url-status=live }}</ref> This caused Bilbao to become an important port, particularly due to its trade with [[Flanders]] and Great Britain.

In 1443 the [[Church of Saint Anthony the Great]] was enshrined, having been built in the place of an old ''[[alcázar]]''. Still today the church is one of the oldest extant buildings of the city. On 5 September 1483, the Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] traveled to Bilbao to swear fealty to the fueros of [[Lordship of Biscay|Biscay]]. Her husband, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] had already done so in 1476 in [[Gernika]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Beascoechea Madina|1999|p=199}}</ref>

=== Modern age ===
[[File:Bilbao1575.jpg|thumb|right|First engraving of the city, made by [[Franz Hohenberg]] in 1544]]
On 21 June 1511, Queen [[Joanna of Castile]] ordered the creation of the [[Consulate of the Sea]] of Bilbao. This would become the most influential institution of the borough for centuries, and would claim jurisdiction over the estuary, improving its infrastructure. Under the Consulate's control, the [[port of Bilbao]] became one of the most important of the kingdom.<ref>[[#tus04|Tussel Gómez 2004]]: 26</ref> The first [[printing-press]] was brought to the town in 1577. Here in 1596, the first book in the [[Basque language]] was edited, entitled ''Doctrina Christiana en Romance y Bascuence'' by Dr. Betolaza.<ref>Beascoechea 1999: 104</ref>

In 1602 Bilbao was made the capital of [[Biscay]], a title previously held by [[Bermeo]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bilbaoport.es/aPBW/web/es/sociedad/visitabilbao/excursiones/bermeo.jsp | publisher = [[Port of Bilbao|Bilbaoport.es]] | title = Un día perfecto en Bermeo y Gernika | access-date = 17 September 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080923055720/http://www.bilbaoport.es/aPBW/web/es/sociedad/visitabilbao/excursiones/bermeo.jsp | archive-date = 23 September 2008 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Around 1631, the city was the scenario of a series of revolts against the increased taxation on salt, which had been ordered by the Crown, an event locally known as the "''Machinada'' of the salt".

=== Contemporary Bilbao ===

==== Napoleonic invasion and Carlist wars ====
[[File:Ataque al Puente de Luchana.jpg|thumb|left|The Battle of Luchana]]
The [[First French Empire|French]] invasion of Spain saw the occupation of several Basque cities, but Bilbao was not among them. The first open uprising against [[Kingdom of Spain under Joseph Bonaparte|Napoleonic rule]] took place on 6 August 1808, a month after the [[Battle of Bailén]]. French troops sieged and sacked the city, alongside the neighbouring towns of Deusto and Begoña on 16 August. Beginning in February 1810, the city was under the command of [[Pierre Thouvenot]], general of the French army and [[Nobility of the First French Empire|Baron of the Empire]], who had become the head of the Military Government of ''Vizcaya'', which included the three Basque provinces. Thouvenot intended to move forward with the plan of total annexation of the Basque provinces into France,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bilbao.net/castella/residentes/vivebilbao/publicaciones/periodicobilbao/200701/pag36.pdf |title=Los hospitales militares y civiles de Bilbao durante la Guerra de la Independencia |last=Gondra |first=Juan |date=January 2007 |website=Bilbao City Hall |access-date=15 October 2008 |archive-date=24 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124082807/http://www.bilbao.net/castella/residentes/vivebilbao/publicaciones/periodicobilbao/200701/pag36.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> but the [[Peninsular War]] and ultimately the [[Battle of Vitoria]] made those plans impossible.
[[File:Bilboko irudi historikoa.jpg|thumb|right|Engraving depicting the city in the 18th century]]
The [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] was one of the main sites of battles during the [[First Carlist War]], a civil war between supporters of the Spanish regent [[Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies|Maria Christina]], known as liberals, and those of the late king's brother [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Carlos of Borbón]], known as Carlists. The [[Carlism|Carlists]] were particularly focused on capturing Bilbao, a liberal and economic bastion in northern Spain.<ref>Quiroga 2001: 68</ref> The Carlist general [[Tomás de Zumalacárregui]] tried to take the city during the siege of Bilbao of 1835, but he was wounded during a battle near [[Begoña]] and died some time after in the town of [[Zegama]]. The next year, the city resisted a second siege during which the liberal general [[Baldomero Espartero, Prince of Vergara|Baldomero Espartero]] defeated the Carlists in the [[Battle of Luchana]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Sánchez-Beaskoetxea|2006|p=42}}</ref> The city was untouched by the [[Second Carlist War]], which took place mostly in [[Catalonia]], but was again an important scenario during the [[Third Carlist War]]; in April 1874 the city suffered a third siege which lasted two months.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{Harvnb|Sánchez-Beaskoetxea|2006|p=44}}</ref>

Despite the warfare, Bilbao prospered during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, when it rose as the economic centre of the Basque Country. It was during this time that the railway first arrived to the city and the Bank of Bilbao (which later would go on to become the [[BBVA]]) was founded, as well as the Bilbao Stock Exchange. Steelmaking industries flourished with the creation of many new factories, including the Santa Ana de Bolueta and the [[Altos Hornos de Vizcaya]] in 1902. The city was modernised with new avenues and walkways, as well as with new modern buildings such as the [[Bilbao City Hall|City Hall building]], the Basurto Hospital and the [[Teatro Arriaga|Arriaga Theatre]].<ref name=autogenerated3 /> The population increased dramatically, from 11,000 in 1880 to 80,000 in 1900. Social movements also arose, notably [[Basque nationalism]] under [[Sabino Arana]], which in the subsequent decades would grow to become the [[Basque Nationalist Party]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Montero, Manuel |title=Crónica de siete siglos |work=Bilbao 700 |page=48 |url=http://www.periodistasvascos.com/imagenes/cap_2.pdf |access-date=15 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724095226/http://www.periodistasvascos.com/imagenes/cap_2.pdf |archive-date=24 July 2008  }}</ref>

==== Civil war and Francoist dictatorship ====
[[File:Bilboko portuaren bonbardaketa.jpg|thumb|left|Bombing of Bilbao during the Civil War, 5 June 1937]]
The [[Spanish Civil War]] in Bilbao started with a number of small uprisings suppressed by the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] forces. On 31 August 1936, the city suffered its first bombing, with a series of air bombs dropped by [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]] airplanes. In September, the Nationalists distributed pamphlets threatening further bombing if the city did not give up, which finally took place on 25 September when German planes, in coordination with Francoist forces, dropped at least a hundred bombs on the city.<ref>Quiroga 2001: 84</ref> In May 1937, the Nationalist army besieged the town. The battle lasted until 19 June of that year, when Lieutenant Colonel Putz was ordered to destroy all bridges over the estuary, and the troops of the 5th Brigade took the borough from the mountains Malmasin, Pagasarri, and Arnotegi.<ref>Sánchez-Beaskoetxea 2006: 48</ref>

With the war over, Bilbao returned to its industrial development, accompanied by steady population growth. In the 1940s, the city was rebuilt, starting with the bridges and by 1948, the first commercial flight took off from the local [[Bilbao Airport|airport]].<ref>Tussel 2004: 187</ref> Over the next decade, there was a revival of the iron industry, which became a strategic industrial sector in Spain, as a consequence of the economic model promoted by [[Francoism]]. The city received migrants from other Spanish regions looking to work in the iron industry. The demand for housing outstripped supply, and workers built slums on the hillsides.<ref name="franquism">Quiroga 2001: 96</ref> It was in this context that the first social movements arose and the strike of the ''Euskalduna'' shipyard in 1947 was the first one to take place during the Francoist dictatorship. In this environment of social repression, on 31 July 1959 the separatist organisation [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] was created from Basque nationalist movements.<ref name="franquism"/> During the 1960s the city was the scenario of several urban projects, with the creation of new neighbourhoods like Otxarkoaga and the motorway to the French border. In June 1968 the University of Bilbao, the first public university, was established. It would later be integrated into the [[University of the Basque Country]].

==== Democracy and urban renewal ====
[[File:Abandoibarra3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Abandoibarra]] and the [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao|Guggenheim Museum]] from the [[Iberdrola Tower]]]]
After the end of [[Spanish State|Francoist Spain]] and the establishment of a [[constitutional monarchy]], in a process known in Spain as [[Spanish transition to democracy|the transition]], Bilbao was able to hold democratic elections again. This time [[Basque nationalism|Basque nationalists]] rose to power.<ref>[[#tus04|Tussel 2004]]: 194</ref> With the approval of the [[Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country]] in 1979, [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] was elected the seat of the government and therefore the ''de facto'' capital of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]], although Bilbao was larger and more powerful economically. In the 1980s, several factors such as labour demands and the arrival of cheap labour from abroad led to a devastating industrial crisis.<ref name="franquism"/>

On 26 August 1983 during the celebration of the local festivities known as ''[[Aste Nagusia]]'', the estuary overflowed up to five metres in some areas due to the continuous raining, killing two people and causing important destructions in the city's infrastructure, with a total economic cost that reached 60,000 million [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]] (around €360 million)<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/BURGOS/CANTABRIA/PAiS_VASCO/34/muertos/Euskadi/Cantabria/Burgos/balance/provisional/elpepiesp/19830901elpepinac_13/Tes/ |title=34 muertos en Euskadi, 4 en Cantabria y 1 en Burgos, balance provisional |last=Ridruejo |first=Carmelo |date=1 September 1983 |work=El País |access-date=8 December 2009 |archive-date=11 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111202501/http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/BURGOS/CANTABRIA/PAIS_VASCO/34/muertos/Euskadi/Cantabria/Burgos/balance/provisional/elpepiesp/19830901elpepinac_13/Tes |url-status=live }}</ref>

Since the mid-1990s, Bilbao has been in a process of deindustrialization and transition to a service economy, supported by investment in infrastructure and [[urban renewal]], starting with the opening of the [[Bilbao Guggenheim Museum]] (the so-called ''Guggenheim effect''),<ref name="guggen"/> and continuing with the [[Euskalduna Conference Centre and Concert Hall]], [[Santiago Calatrava]]'s [[Zubizuri]], the [[Metro Bilbao|metro network]] by [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]], the [[Bilbao tram|tram]], the [[Iberdrola Tower]] and the [[Zorrozaurre]] development plan, among others. Many officially supported associations such as Bilbao Metrópoli-30 and Bilbao Ría 2000 were created to monitor these projects.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bm30.es/homeage_es.html | title = Agentes del proceso de revitalización | publisher = BM30 | access-date = 16 October 2008 | archive-date = 20 July 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720135704/http://www.bm30.es/homeage_es.html | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bilbaoria2000.org/ria2000/cas/bilbaoRia/bilbaoRia.aspx?primeraVez=0 | title = BILBAO Ría 2000 ¿Qué es? | publisher = Bilbao Ría 2000 | access-date = 15 October 2008 | archive-date = 25 July 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725073505/http://www.bilbaoria2000.org/ria2000/cas/bilbaoRia/bilbaoRia.aspx?primeraVez=0 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

{{Main|Climate of Bilbao}}
[[File:Deustuko San Pedro-Erribera, Bilbo, Bizkaia, Spain - panoramio (2).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Palm trees during a sunny day in Bilbao]]
Its proximity to the [[Bay of Biscay]] gives Bilbao an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb''), with precipitation occurring throughout the year and without a well-defined dry summer. Precipitation is abundant, and given the latitude and atmospheric dynamics, rainy days represent 45% and cloudy days 40% of the annual total.<ref>[[#gom79|Gómez Piñeiro 1979]]: 65</ref> The rainiest season is between October and April, November being the wettest. Snow is not frequent in Bilbao, although it is possible to see snow on the top of the surrounding mountains. [[Rain and snow mixed|Sleet]] is more frequent, about 10 days per year, mainly in the winter months.<ref>[[#gom79|Gómez Piñeiro 1979]]: 70</ref> Bilbao is nearest to the subtropical boundary of all the Atlantic coastal cities in the country with an August daily mean of {{convert|20.9|C|F}}.<ref name="Standard climate values for Bilbao">{{cite web|url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=1082&k=pva|title=Standard climate values for Bilbao|publisher=Aemet.es|access-date=23 July 2015|archive-date=23 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723075414/http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=1082&k=pva|url-status=live}}</ref> There is also a drying trend in summer with only around {{convert|50|mm|in}} of rainfall in July<ref name="Standard climate values for Bilbao"/> – but not dry enough to be considered Mediterranean.

The proximity of the ocean also means that the two best defined seasons (summer and winter) remain mild, with low intensity thermal oscillations. Average maximum temperatures vary between {{convert|25|and|26|°C|1|abbr=on}} in the summer months, while the average minimum in winter is between {{convert|6|and|7|°C|1|abbr=on}}.

Extreme record observations in Bilbao are {{convert|42.9|°C|1|abbr=on}} maximum (on 11 August 2024) and  {{convert|-8.6|°C|1|abbr=on}} minimum (on 3 February 1963). The maximum precipitation in a day was {{convert|225.6|mm|0|abbr=on}} on 26 August 1983 when [[1983 Spanish floods|severe flooding]] was caused by the Nervión river.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www2.bilbao.net/bilbaoturismo/castellano/cbureau/clima.htm | title = City Council climate information | publisher = Bilbao City Council | access-date = 7 October 2010 | archive-date = 17 December 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101217165523/http://www2.bilbao.net/bilbaoturismo/castellano/cbureau/clima.htm | url-status = live }}</ref>

== Demographics ==
[[File:Demografía Bilbao (España).PNG|thumb|Demographic evolution, 1900–2005, according to the Spanish National Institute of Statistics]]
According to the [[Basque Statistics Office]], the population of Bilbao is 342,397 people as of 2017,<ref name="eustat">{{cite web |url=http://www.eustat.eus/municipal/datos_estadisticos/bilbao_c.html |title=Datos Estadísticos de Bilbao |author=<!--Not stated--> |year=2017 |website=Web Eustat |publisher=[[Basque Statistics Office]] |access-date=18 August 2018 |archive-date=26 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180826183010/http://www.eustat.eus/municipal/datos_estadisticos/bilbao_c.html |url-status=live }}</ref> distributed on a land area of {{convert|40.59|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, making Bilbao the largest city by population of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]] and of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] as a whole. Bilbao makes the main component of the [[Bilbao metropolitan area]], with a population of 1,037,847 people.

The first credible data on the population of Bilbao are post-1550.<ref name="earlypop">[[#gom79|Gómez Piñeiro 1979]]: 96</ref> It is known that in 1530 [[Biscay]] had approximately 65,000 inhabitants, a number that could have been reduced by [[Plague (disease)|plagues]] that struck the city in 1517, 1530, 1564–68, and 1597–1601, the last being especially devastating.<ref name="earlypop"/> This trend for periodic reverses in population growth was maintained until the nineteenth century. Since then, Bilbao has experienced an exponential growth in population thanks to industrialisation. After a peak of 433,115 inhabitants in 1982, the municipalities of the [[Txorierri]] valley were removed from Bilbao, with the corresponding loss of their population.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bilbao.net/castella/relaciones_ciudadanas/publicaciones/bilbao_en_cifras/2007/demografia.pdf | title = Evolución de la Población de Bilbao 1900 – 2007 | publisher = Bilbao City Council | year = 2007 | access-date = 17 September 2008 | archive-date = 1 October 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091001170943/http://www.bilbao.net/castella/relaciones_ciudadanas/publicaciones/bilbao_en_cifras/2007/demografia.pdf | url-status = live }}</ref>

Spanish is the most spoken language in the city, followed by the vernacular [[Basque language]]. According to the city government of Bilbao, at least 51% of the population can speak "some Basque",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bilbao.net/cs/Satellite?c=Page&cid=3000054794&language=es&pageid=3000054794&pagename=Bilbaonet%2FPage%2FBIO_contenidoFinal |title=La situación del euskera en Bilbao |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Bilbao City Hall |access-date=18 August 2018 |archive-date=9 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709184803/http://bilbao.net/cs/Satellite?c=Page&cid=3000054794&language=es&pageid=3000054794&pagename=Bilbaonet%2FPage%2FBIO_contenidoFinal |url-status=live }}</ref> while 29% consider themselves to be fluent.<ref name="eustat" />

== Government ==
[[File:Bilbao_-_Diputacion_Foral_de_Vizcaya_2.jpg|thumb|right|Building of the provincial government of Biscay]]
The city of Bilbao is the capital of the [[Provinces of Spain|province]] of [[Biscay]] and as such it is home of the administrative entities that pertain to the provincial administration, both from the [[Autonomous Communities of Spain|autonomous]] and central governments. Settled in the city are the provincial delegations of the different departments of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque autonomous government]], each coordinated by a representative. In addition, the [[Government of Spain]] has the official [[Government Sub-delegation (Spain)|Government Subdelegation]] in the city.

=== Municipal government ===
{{main|Bilbao City Council}}
[[File:Bilbao_-_Ayuntamiento_24.jpg|thumb|right|The Bilbao City Hall]]
Bilbao is a [[Municipalities of Spain|municipality]] and has a [[Mayor–council government|mayor-council government system]]. The municipal government is elected for four-year terms by [[universal suffrage]] and it is divided into two branches, executive and legislative.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bilbao.net/nuevobilbao/jsp/bilbao/pwepl004.jsp?idioma=i&color=rojo&subtema=10&puntomenu=plc&tema=ep1&padre=EPM | title = Nature, Attributions and Organisation | publisher = Ayuntamiento de Bilbao | access-date = 10 October 2010}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref> The legislative side consists of a municipal plenum composed of 29 [[councillor]]s. These councillors represent the different political parties elected in the local elections, for which can vote all residents registered in the city who are citizens of Spain or of any member state of the [[European Union]]. The executive branch is composed of the mayor and a board of governors. The number of members of the board cannot be more than a third the number of members of the legislative plenum and the mayor can appoint them at his or her own discretion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bilbao.net/cs/Satellite?c=Page&cid=3000016190&language=es&pageid=3000016190&pagename=Bilbaonet%2FPage%2FBIO_contenidoFinal |title=La Junta del Gobierno de la Villa de Bilbao: Naturaleza, Atribuciones y Organización |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Bilbao City Hall |publisher=Bilbao Municipal Government |access-date=15 October 2008 |archive-date=15 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515184344/http://www.bilbao.net/cs/Satellite?c=Page&cid=3000016190&language=es&pageid=3000016190&pagename=Bilbaonet%2FPage%2FBIO_contenidoFinal |url-status=live }}</ref>

Since 1892 the seat of the government has been the [[Bilbao City Hall]], located on the centric [[Ernesto Erkoreka Plaza]] and by the [[Estuary of Bilbao]]. It is the fourth city hall building to have been used since the year 1300. The first three city halls were located by the [[Church of Saint Anthony the Great|San Antón Church]] but were destroyed due to floodings. The current building was designed by the Spanish architect Joaquín Rucoba in [[Baroque architecture|Baroque style]] and was built in the former site of the San Agustín Monastery, which was destroyed during the [[First Carlist War]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bilbao.net/cs/Satellite?c=BIO_Generico_FA&cid=3000787796&language=en&pageid=3000018206&pagename=Bilbaonet%2FBIO_Generico_FA%2FBIO_Generico |archive-url=https://archive.today/20150227182748/https://www.bilbao.net/cs/Satellite?c=BIO_Generico_FA&cid=3000787796&language=en&pageid=3000018206&pagename=Bilbaonet/BIO_Generico_FA/BIO_Generico |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 February 2015 |title=Las ruinas de San Agustín |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Bilbao City Hall |publisher=Bilbao Municipal Government |access-date=27 November 2008 }}</ref> Since the [[Spanish transition to democracy]], the city has been governed by the [[Basque Nationalist Party]], often with support of the [[Socialist Party of the Basque Country–Basque Country Left|Socialist Party of the Basque Country]].

=== Districts ===

The municipality is divided into eight districts (Basque: ''barrutia'') which are further subdivided into 34 neighbourhoods (Basque: ''auzoa''). Most of the districts and neighbourhoods were former independent municipalities and [[elizate]]s that were eventually annexed into the city. Originally, the city of Bilbao comprised the Old Town and some houses on the left side of the estuary, today known as [[Bilbao la Vieja]]. The first expansion included the annexation of the elizate of [[Begoña]] and the river side of [[Uribarri]]. In the 19th century the merge of [[Abando]] into the city brought along small neighbourhoods of farm houses and hamlets that were clustered close to the former municipality's town hall and the [[Mount Cobetas]], such as [[Errekalde]] and [[Basurto-Zorroza|Basurto]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1= González|first1=Santiago |title=Una expansión organizada |url= http://www.periodistasvascos.com/imagenes/cap_4.pdf|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080724095306/http://www.periodistasvascos.com/imagenes/cap_4.pdf|url-status= dead|archive-date= 24 July 2008|journal=Bilbao 700 |page=120 |access-date=16 October 2008}}</ref> Starting in the 20th century it started annexing the elizates on the right bank of the river, including Begoña and [[Deusto]]. In the decade of 1960 as an effort to stop the increasing problem of [[slum]]s, new neighbourhoods were created from the ground up, among them Otxarkoaga and Txurdinaga, which were joined together as a new district, [[Otxarkoaga-Txurdinaga]] in the decade of 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bilbao.net/castella/accion_social/publicaciones/estudio_otxarkoaga.pdf |title=Estudio sobre el barrio de Otxarkoaga |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Bilbao City Hall |publisher=Municipal Government of Bilbao |access-date=16 October 2008 |archive-date=24 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124082742/http://www.bilbao.net/castella/accion_social/publicaciones/estudio_otxarkoaga.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

Bilbao has been the economic centre of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque autonomous community]] since the original establishment of the [[Consulate of the Sea]] in the city in the 16th century, mostly thanks to the commerce in [[Castile (historical region)|Castilian]] products on the town's [[Port of Bilbao|port]]. It was in the 19th century when the city experimented its biggest economic development, mainly based on the exploitation of the nearby iron mines and [[siderurgy]], both of which promoted maritime traffic and port activity and eventually the development of a very important shipbuilding industry.<ref name="Economy of Bilbao">http://www.bilbao.net/nuevobilbao/jsp/bilbao/pwegb010.jsp?idioma=C&color=rojo&padre=|HT&tema=FBS&subtema=10&padresub=*M4&textarea=*M4{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

=== Banking ===
[[File:Bilbao - BBVA (ex Banco de Comercio) 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Headquarters of BBVA]]
Banking became an important sector with the establishment of the Bank of Bilbao (Spanish: ''Banco de Bilbao'') in 1857 and the Bank of Biscay (Spanish: ''Banco de Vizcaya'') in 1901. These two entities merged in 1988 creating the BBV, which finally merged with Argentaria bank in 1999, creating the current multinational corporation, the [[Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria|BBVA]]. The [[savings bank]]s that were established locally, the Municipal Savings Bank of Bilbao (Spanish: ''Caja de Ahorros Municipal de Bilbao'') in 1907 and the Provincial Savings Bank of Biscay (Spanish: ''Caja de Ahorros Provincial de Vizcaya'') in 1921, would merge in 1990 to form the [[Bilbao Bizkaia Kutxa]] (BBK),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://portal.bbk.es/internet/banners/centenario/libro/index.html |title=bbk 100 años |publisher=Portal.bbk.es |access-date=10 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720140314/https://portal.bbk.es/internet/banners/centenario/libro/index.html |archive-date=20 July 2011  }}</ref> which would merge again in 2012 with other Basque financial entities ([[Kutxa]] and Caja Vital Kutxa) to form [[Kutxabank]].

=== Port ===
{{main|Port of Bilbao}}
[[File:Serantes Panoramica.jpg|thumb|Panoramic view of the outer port, as seen from Mount Serantes]]
The historical port was located in what is today an area called the Arenal, a few steps from the old city, until the late 19th century. In 1902, an exterior port was built at [[Bilbao Abra|the mouth]] of the estuary, in the coastal municipality of [[Santurtzi]]. Further extensions to the outer port, which became called "the super-port", led to the final move of the city portuary facilities in the 1970s, finally replacing the docks in the centre of the city,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.periodistasvascos.com/imagenes/cap_6.pdf |title=El Puerto: Desde San Antón al Abra |author1=Corres Abásolo |author2=José Ángel |access-date=16 October 2008 |work=Bilbao 700 |page=212 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724095122/http://www.periodistasvascos.com/imagenes/cap_6.pdf |archive-date=24 July 2008  }}</ref> with the exception of those located in the neighbourhood of Zorrotza, still active.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deia.com/es/impresa/2006/02/08/bizkaia/herrialdeak/216736.php |title=El Puerto abandonó ayer el Canal de Deusto tras 38 años de actividad comercial |work=Deia |access-date=31 October 2007 |date=8 February 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124075722/http://www.deia.com/es/impresa/2006/02/08/bizkaia/herrialdeak/216736.php |archive-date=24 January 2009 }}</ref>

=== Mining and ironworks ===
Iron is the main and most abundant [[raw material]] found in [[Biscay]], and its extraction has been legally regulated since 1526. Mining was the main [[primary sector of the economy|primary activity]] in Bilbao and the minerals, of great quality, were exported to all over Europe.<ref name="siderurgy">{{cite web|url=http://www.periodistasvascos.com/imagenes/cap_6.pdf |title=Bessemer cambió la historia |author1=Diez Alday |author2=José Antonio |work=Bilbao 700 |access-date=16 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724095122/http://www.periodistasvascos.com/imagenes/cap_6.pdf |archive-date=24 July 2008  }}</ref> It was not until the second half of the nineteenth century that an ironworks industry was developed, benefiting from the resources and the city's good communication links. In the 20th century, both Spanish and European capitals imported around 90% of the iron from Biscay.<ref name="siderurgy"/> Although World War I made Bilbao one of the main ironworks powers, a subsequent crisis prompted a decline in the activity.

=== Tourism ===
[[File:Bilbao - Ria.jpg|thumb|Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]]
The first notion of Bilbao as a tourist destination came with the inauguration of the railway between Bilbao and the coastal neighbourhood of [[Las Arenas]], in the municipality of [[Getxo]] in 1872. The connection made Bilbao a minor beach destination.<ref>Montero, Manuel (2005). p. 97.</ref>

The real tourist surge though would come much later with the inauguration of the [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]] in 1997. Thereafter tourist arrivals registered a continued upward trend, reaching over 932,000 visitors in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eldiario.es/norte/euskadi/Bilbao-recibe-turistas-visitantes-consecutivo_0_860564469.html|title=Bilbao recibe 932.771 turistas en 2018 y bate el récord de visitantes por quinto año consecutivo|agency=Europa Press|website=eldiario.es|date=24 January 2019|language=es|access-date=2019-05-24|archive-date=24 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524091928/https://www.eldiario.es/norte/euskadi/Bilbao-recibe-turistas-visitantes-consecutivo_0_860564469.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The trend was exponential considering that in 1995, Bilbao only counted 25,000 tourists.<ref name="tourism">{{cite web | url = http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/v/20101001/vizcaya/bilbao-solo-ciudad-paso-20101001.html | title = Bilbao ya no es sólo una ciudad de paso | access-date = 18 October 2010 | date = 1 October 2010 | editor = El Correo| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101007122040/http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/v/20101001/vizcaya/bilbao-solo-ciudad-paso-20101001.html| archive-date= 7 October 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> Bilbao also hosts 31% of the total [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] visitors, being the top destination of this autonomous community, outranking [[San Sebastián]].<ref name="tourism"/> The majority of tourists are domestic visitors, coming from [[Madrid]] and [[Catalonia]].

=== Stock exchange ===
Plans to create a [[stock exchange]] market in Bilbao began in the early 19th century, even though it would not be realized until 21 July 1890.<ref name="periodistasvascos.com"/> Bilbao's institution is one of the country's four regional stock exchanges, joining [[Barcelona]], [[Madrid]], and [[Valencia]] as Spain's commercial centres. It is owned by [[Bolsas y Mercados Españoles]].

=== Urban planning ===
[[File:Casco viejo.jpg|thumb|The Old Town]]
[[File:Bilbao-07.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|The Gothic St. James Cathedral]]
In its beginnings, Bilbao only had three streets (''Somera'', ''Artecalle'', and ''Tendería'') surrounded by walls located where Ronda street now stands. Inside this enclosure, there was a small [[hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]] dedicated to the Apostle [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]] (the current [[Bilbao Cathedral|St. James' Cathedral]]), which pilgrims visited on their [[Way of St. James|way to]] [[Santiago de Compostela]]. In the fifteenth century, four more streets were built, forming the original ''[[Zazpikaleak]]'' or "Seven Streets".<ref>[[#tus04|Tusell 2004]]: 19</ref> In 1571, after several floods and a major fire in 1569, the walls were demolished in order to allow the expansion of the town.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.euskomedia.org/PDFAnlt/atlas_vasconia/biz/es/00530106es.pdf | publisher = euskomedia.org | title = El espacio público de la villa de Bilbao | author1 = Arizaga Balumburu, Beatriz | author2 = Martínez Martínez, Sergio | name-list-style = amp | access-date = 17 September 2008 | archive-date = 25 July 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725134335/http://www.euskomedia.org/PDFAnlt/atlas_vasconia/biz/es/00530106es.pdf | url-status = dead }}</ref>

In 1861, engineer Amado Lázaro projected an ''[[ensanche]]'' inside the then-municipality of [[Abando]] with wide avenues and regular buildings, that included the hygienists ideas of the time. The project was mostly based on [[Barcelona]]'s ''[[Eixample]]'', designed by [[Ildefons Cerdà]].<ref name="urban">{{cite web | url = http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/1116/122862 | title = Bilbao (Urbanismo, siglos XIX y XX) | publisher = euskomedia.org | access-date = 8 October 2010 | archive-date = 21 October 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121021100706/http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/1116/122862 | url-status = live }}</ref> However, the project was dropped by the [[Bilbao City Council]] after considering it "utopian and excessive" because of its high cost, though of great quality. Furthermore, Lázaro had calculated the demographic growth of the town was based on the previous three centuries, a provision that eventually would not conform to reality.<ref name="urban"/><ref>[[#mon00|Montero 2000]]: 45</ref>

The next large urban change in Bilbao would come in 1876, when the capital [[annexation|annexed]] (in several stages) the neighbouring municipality of Abando. The new ''ensanche'' project was planned by a team made of architect Severino de Achúcarro and engineers Pablo de Alzola (elected Mayor that same year), and Ernesto de Hoffmeyer. Unlike Lázaro's, this project was significantly smaller, compassing {{convert|1.58|km2|abbr=on}} against the original {{convert|2.54|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref name="urban"/> It also featured a not so strict [[grid pattern]], a park to separate the industrial and residential areas and the [[Gran Vía de Don Diego López de Haro]], the main thoroughfare, where many relevant buildings were located, such as the Biscay provincial government hall or the BBVA Tower. By the end of the 1890s, this widening was half completed and already filled, so a new extension was planned by Federico Ugalde.<ref name="urban"/>

By 1925, the municipalities of [[Deusto]] and [[Begoña]], as well as part of [[Erandio]] were annexed, and in 1940, the remaining part of Erandio became part of Bilbao. The last annexation took place in 1966, with the municipalities of [[Loiu]], [[Sondika]], [[Derio]], and [[Zamudio]]. This made Bilbao larger than ever, with {{convert|107|km2|abbr=on}}. However, all these municipalities, with the exception of Deusto and Begoña regained their independence on 1 January 1983.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euskadi.net/cgi-bin_k54/ver_c?CMD=VERDOC&BASE=B03J&DOCN=000030346&CONF=/config/k54/bopv_c.cnf |title=BOE del País Vasco |publisher=[[Basque Government]] |access-date=17 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002082844/http://www.euskadi.net/cgi-bin_k54/ver_c?CMD=VERDOC&BASE=B03J&DOCN=000030346&CONF=%2Fconfig%2Fk54%2Fbopv_c.cnf |archive-date=2 October 2013  }}</ref>

[[File:Bilbao - Zubizuri 07.jpg|thumb|left|[[Isozaki Atea]] and the Zubizuri footbridge, symbols of the city's transformation]]
Bilbao's buildings display a variety of architectural styles, ranging from [[Gothic architecture|gothic]], [[Art Deco]], [[Art Nouveau]], [[Neo-Gothic]], and [[contemporary architecture]]. The [[Casco Viejo|Old Town]] features many of the oldest buildings in the city, as the [[Bilbao Cathedral|St. James' Cathedral]] or the [[Church of Saint Anthony the Great|Church of San Antón]], included in the borough's coat of arms. Most of the Old Town is a [[pedestrian zone]] during the day. Nearby is one of the most important religious temples of Biscay, the [[Basilica of Begoña]], dedicated to the patron saint of the province, [[Our Lady of Begoña]].

Seventeen bridges span the banks of the estuary inside the town's boundaries. Among the most interesting ones are the [[Zubizuri]] (Basque for "white bridge"), a pedestrian [[footbridge]] designed by [[Santiago Calatrava]] opened in 1997, and the [[La Salve|Princes of Spain Bridge]], also known as "La Salve", a [[suspension bridge]] opened in 1972 and redesigned by French [[concept art|conceptual artist]] [[Daniel Buren]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim-bilbao.es/secciones/programacion_artistica/nombre_exposicion_version_imprimible.php?idioma=en&id_exposicion=70 |title=Red Arches |publisher=Guggenheim Bilbao |date=20 October 2006 |access-date=10 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718025729/http://www.guggenheim-bilbao.es/secciones/programacion_artistica/nombre_exposicion_version_imprimible.php?idioma=en&id_exposicion=70 |archive-date=18 July 2011  }}</ref> The [[Deusto Bridge]] is a [[bascule bridge]] opened in 1936 and modelled after the [[Michigan Avenue Bridge]], in Chicago.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www2.deia.com/es/impresa/2008/04/23/bizkaia/herrialdeak/461574.php | title = El puente de Deusto afronta su primera reforma integral tras 70 años de servicio | newspaper = Deia | date = 23 April 2008 | access-date = 10 November 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110709011034/http://www2.deia.com/es/impresa/2008/04/23/bizkaia/herrialdeak/461574.php | archive-date = 9 July 2011 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Between 1890 and 1893 the first [[transporter bridge]] (''"[[Bizkaia Bridge|Puente Colgante]]"'') in the world on the [[Nervion]] river, between [[Portugalete]] and [[Getxo]], was built by [[Alberto Palacio]] (architect and engineer) together with his brother Silvestre.

Since the deindustrialization process started in the 1990s, many of the former industrial areas are being transformed into modern public and private spaces designed by several of the world's most renowned architects and artists. The main example is the [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao|Guggenheim Museum]], located in what was an old dock and wood warehouse.

}}</ref> The festivities begin on the first Saturday before 22 August, and during those nine days the city hall organises a series of cultural events of diverse kind, including concerts, stage plays, [[Basque rural sports]] and [[Spanish-style bullfighting|bullfighting]], as well as nightly firework displays. The festivities begin with the ''chupinazo'' or ''txupinazo'', which is the launch of a small rocket, and the reading of a proclamation by the festivities' herald. The central point of the festivities is the place around the ''txosnas'', where the different ''[[Comparsa|konpartsak]]'' are reunited, organised by neighbourhood associations as well as cultural, social and political groups. The symbol of the festivities is ''Marijaia'', a large doll which is burned during the last day of celebrations.

Beyond the main festivities of the ''Aste Nagusia'', the city also celebrates some minor festivities, many of them religious in nature, such as [[Agatha of Sicily|Saint Agatha]] on 5 February, the celebrations of [[Our Lady of Begoña]] on 11 October, the Day of [[Thomas the Apostle]] on 21 December and the Christmas festivities, centred around the figure of [[Olentzero]]. There are also festivities in the different neighbourhoods and districts which are celebrated locally, such as the ''Fiestas del Carmen'' in Santutxu and Indautxu, ''Fiestas Santiago'' in Bilbao la Vieja, ''Fiestas San Ignacio'' in San Inazio and ''Fiestas San Roque'' in Arxtanda and Larraskitu.

The city also hosts the International Festival of Documentary and Short Film under the commercial name of Zinebi. It was first held in 1959 under the name International Festival of Ibero-American and Filipino Documentary Film of Bilbao, with the goal of being complementary to the [[San Sebastián International Film Festival]]. Since 1981 it is organised by the city hall and takes place in the Arriaga Theatre. Bilbao is also the host of the SAIL in Festival, a yearly event centred exclusively around sailing, which brings together international representatives of this sport.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kulturklik.euskadi.eus/evento/2018022111025172/sail-in-festival-2018/kulturklik/es/z12-detalle/es/ |title=SAIL in Festival 2018 |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=kulturklik |date=21 February 2018 |publisher=Basque Autonomous Government |access-date=9 September 2018 |archive-date=9 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909185603/http://www.kulturklik.euskadi.eus/evento/2018022111025172/sail-in-festival-2018/kulturklik/es/z12-detalle/es/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Cuisine ===
{{see also|Basque cuisine}}
[[File:Bacalao Vizcaina (Marugán).jpg|thumb|right|Biscayan-style cod]]
Traditional Bilbao dishes are centred around products from the sea and the estuary, such as [[European eel|eels]] and [[Atlantic cod|cod]]. For the most part Bilbao shares its original gastronomy with that of the province of [[Biscay]], including dishes such as ''bacalao al pil pil'' (cod fish cooked with olive oil, garlic and guindilla peppers), ''bacalao a la vizcaína'' (salted cod with Biscayan sauce, mostly made of ''choricero'' peppers and onions), ''merluza en salsa verde'' (hake fish with [[green sauce]]), ''chipirones en su tinta'' ([[Squid as food|squid]] served with [[Cephalopod ink|its own ink]]), ''morros a la vizcaína'' (beef snouts with Biscayan sauce), ''revuelto de perretxikos'' (scrambled eggs with mushrooms) and desserts such as ''canutillos de Bilbao'' (puff pastries filled with custard or chocolate), ''[[Pantxineta]]'' (puff pastries filled with custard and almonds), [[rice cake]]s and ''bollos de mantequilla'' (butter buns).

Bilbao, as other [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] cities, is known for a variety of appetizers and snacks, being prominent among them the ''[[Pincho|pintxos]]'', which are typically eaten in bars and that consist of small slices of bread on top of which is placed an ingredient or mixture of ingredients, generally of many different types and usually including elements typical of Basque cuisine. Other snacks include ''rabas'' (fried or battered calamari rings, usually served with lemon slices), [[Spanish omelette]] (omelette made with eggs and potatoes, sometimes including onions and peppers), ''{{lang|es|txampis}}'' (stuffed mushrooms), ''triángulos'' (Bilbao-style sandwiches),<ref>{{cite news |last=Basabe |first=Nere |date=27 November 2013 |title=Culto a los triángulos de Bilbao |url=https://elviajero.elpais.com/elviajero/2013/11/19/actualidad/1384888329_411290.html |work=El País |access-date=9 September 2018 |archive-date=9 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909185119/https://elviajero.elpais.com/elviajero/2013/11/19/actualidad/1384888329_411290.html |url-status=live }}</ref> ''gildas'' (one or more olives, a ''guindilla'' pepper and an anchovy joined together with a toothpick).

As for beverages, typical from the region is the ''[[txakoli]]'', a [[white wine]] usually drunk as an [[Apéritif and digestif|apéritif]]. Biscayan ''txakoli'' (''[[Bizkaiko Txakolina]]'') is a protected {{Lang|es|[[Denominación de origen]]}} for the white wine produced in the province of Biscay and it is usually served in Bilbao. Also typical are [[cider]], ''[[patxaran]]'' ([[sloe]]-flavoured liqueur) and [[Rioja (wine)|''Rioja'' wine]].

There are many restaurants and bars who serve these dishes and beverages, especially around the [[Casco Viejo]] quarter. ''[[Txoko]]s'' are also a very popular institution in Bilbao, as in other Basque cities and towns. Bilbao, and the province of Biscay as a whole, is one of the spanish cities with a greater number of recognized restaurants by the gastronomic guides, among them several Michelin-starred restaurants.

=== Language ===

The Spanish language is the most used language of the city, followed by the [[Basque language]], which is vernacular to the region. The presence of Basque in the city is less prominent than in other municipalities of the region, such as [[Bermeo]] or [[Lekeitio]]. In 1986, the bilingual Basque-speaking population represented about 28% of the total. However, the number of Basque speakers has experienced a continuous increase since, reaching a figure of 37% in 2001.<ref name="Basque language">{{cite web |url=http://www.bilbao.net/castella/relaciones_ciudadanas/publicaciones/bilbao_en_cifras/2007/euskera.pdf |title=Linguistic competence of the Bilbao population older than 5 years. |author=<!--Not stated--> |year=2001 |website=Bilbao City Hall |publisher=Bilbao Municipal Government |access-date=20 October 2008 |archive-date=1 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001170837/http://www.bilbao.net/castella/relaciones_ciudadanas/publicaciones/bilbao_en_cifras/2007/euskera.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> More than half of the Basque speakers were younger than 30 and lived in the districts of Deusto, Begoña and Abando.<ref name="Basque language" />

According to the data from the 2016 census, the population older than 2 years old registered in the municipality of Bilbao who speaks Basque fluently represents 29% of the total population, while those who can speak it with difficulty represent around 19.95% of the total. Finally, those who cannot speak or understand the language represent the remaining 51.06% of the census.

=== Roads and highways ===

Bilbao is a relevant transport hub for northern Spain. Bilbao is connected to three major motorways and a series of minor roads of national and provincial level. The city lies on two international roads, the [[European route E70]] that follows the coast of the [[Bay of Biscay]] and the cities of [[Santander, Spain|Santander]] and [[Gijón]] to the west and with [[Eibar]], [[San Sebastián]] and [[Bordeaux]] to the east. The [[European route E80]] connects the city with inner Spain to the south, including [[Burgos]] and [[Salamanca]] and continuing to [[Lisbon]], and [[Toulouse]] to the north. The [[Autopista AP-68|AP-68]] motorway (European road E-804) starts in the city, joining with [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]], [[Logroño]] and ending in [[Zaragoza]].

The city is connected with the regions of [[Cantabria]], Asturias and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] via the [[Autovía A-8|A-8]] motorway and with [[Durango, Biscay|Durango]], Eibar, San Sebastián and the French border via the [[Autopista AP-8|AP-8]] motorway, which is a toll road. The AP-68 toll motorway to the south is the main road connecting Bilbao with southern Spain and the Mediterranean coast, connecting in [[Miranda de Ebro]] with the [[Autovía A-1|A-1]] to [[Madrid]] and in Zaragoza with the [[Autopista AP-2|AP-2]] to [[Barcelona]].

Minor roads passing through Bilbao or starting in the city itself include the national road [[N-634 road (Spain)|N-634]] which connects San Sebastián with [[Santiago de Compostela]] and runs parallel to the A-8 and AP-8 motorways. The regional road BI-631 connects Bilbao with [[Bermeo]], while the BI-626 joins the city with [[Balmaseda]]. The city is circled by the BI-625 and N-637 roads, which form a half-ring to the east, and the N-634 and A-8 to the west.

The city's main arteries the [[Gran Vía de Don Diego López de Haro]], which crosses the financial and business district of [[Abando]] and connecting it with the [[Casco Viejo]] to the east and the San Mamés area to the west. The Sabino Arana Avenue and Juan Antonio Zunzunegui Avenue provide a direct route between the central districts and the motorways while Autonomía Street joins the southern districts on an east-west direction. The city has 14 bridges connecting opposite sides of the [[Estuary of Bilbao]] and the [[Cadagua|Kadagua]] river, including the [[La Salve]] and Euskalduna bridges, as well a series of tunnels under the [[Mount Artxanda]].

=== Airports ===
[[File:Aeropuerto Bilbao Loiu 01.jpg|thumb|right|Bilbao Airport]]
Bilbao is served by the [[Bilbao Airport]] (BIO), the busiest terminal in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and in the entire Northern coast, with more than 5.4&nbsp;million passengers in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aena.es/csee/ccurl/792/416/Informe2018_provisionales.pdf|title=Tráfico de pasajeros, operaciones y carga en los aeropuertos españoles|year=2018|publisher=[[Aena]]|access-date=24 May 2019|archive-date=14 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190114210531/http://www.aena.es/csee/ccurl/792/416/Informe2018_provisionales.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> It is located {{convert|12|km|2|abbr=on}} north of the borough, between the municipalities of [[Loiu]] and [[Sondika]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite?Language=ES_ES&pagename=subHome&MO=1&SMO=1&SiteName=BIO&c=Page&cid=1047658432537 |title=Cómo llegar |editor=[[Aena]] |access-date=22 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922012153/http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite?cid=1047658432537&pagename=subHome&Language=ES_ES&SMO=1&SiteName=BIO&c=Page&MO=1 |archive-date=22 September 2008  }}</ref> 20 airlines operate in the terminal, including [[Iberia]], [[Lufthansa]], and [[TAP Portugal]].

Although originally expected to be completed by 2014, the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|financial crisis]] and the decrease of passenger traffic delayed it to at least 2019.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/v/20101119/vizcaya/ampliacion-aeropuerto-bilbao-retrasa-20101119.html | title = La ampliación del aeropuerto de Bilbao se retrasa al menos 5 años | work = [[El Correo]] | date = 19 November 2010 | access-date = 23 January 2011 | archive-date = 26 January 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110126103340/http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/v/20101119/vizcaya/ampliacion-aeropuerto-bilbao-retrasa-20101119.html | url-status = live }}</ref> No work has begun as of 2018.

Some low-cost airlines, such as [[Ryanair]], also use the [[Vitoria Airport]] (VIT) located in [[Foronda]] located 59&nbsp;km (37&nbsp;mi) south of the city.

=== Railways ===
{{Main|Bilbao rail network}}

[[File:Bilbao - Estación de Abando Indalecio Prieto 02.jpg|thumb|right|Bilbao-Abando railway station]]
Long-distance rail lines connect Bilbao with Madrid, Barcelona and other destinations in northern Spain. The city has four railway stations: the [[Bilbao-Abando railway station|Bilbao-Abando]] and [[Bilbao Concordia|Bilbao-Concordia]] railway stations are owned by [[Adif]] and operated by the Spanish railways [[Renfe Operadora|Renfe]], whereas the [[Bilbao-Atxuri Station|Bilbao-Atxuri]] and [[Zazpikaleak/Casco Viejo]] stations are owned by the Basque railway network ETS and operated by [[Euskotren]], serving short-distance local destinations.

The Bilbao-Abando station is the main railway station of the city, with Renfe running [[Iberian-gauge railways|Iberian-gauge]] long-distance [[Alvia]] trains to [[Madrid]] and [[Barcelona]], as well as Intercity services to [[Vigo]] with connections possible to [[A Coruña]] and [[Hendaye]]. During the summer there are special trains to [[Málaga]]. The city will be connected to the [[Basque Y]] high-speed train network around 2023, allowing for high speed [[AVE]] trains to operate between the Basque capitals and also to Madrid and other Spanish cities in the future.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=The new stations in Bilbao and Vitoria will be defined by the end of the year |url=http://www.elcorreo.com/sociedad/nuevas-estaciones-bilbao-20171030182922-nt.html |work=El Correo |date=30 October 2017 |access-date=11 September 2018 |archive-date=14 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914060659/https://www.elcorreo.com/sociedad/nuevas-estaciones-bilbao-20171030182922-nt.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The arrival of the new high speed services will involve the creation of a completely new underground station that will replace the current infrastructure.

Bilbao-Concordia station is located in close vicinity to Bilbao-Abando, and hosts the [[narrow-gauge railway]] services ran by Renfe under the [[Renfe Feve]] brand. Renfe runs frequent regional trains to the cities of [[Santander, Spain|Santander]] and [[León, Spain|León]]. [[Euskotren Trena]] runs regular services to [[Bermeo]] from the Bilbao-Atxuri station, while in the Zazpikaleak/Casco Viejo station there are regional services to Durango, Eibar and San Sebastián.

=== Public transport ===
[[File:Bilbao Metro 05 2012 2406.jpg|thumb|right|Abando station of Bilbao metro]]
[[File:Bilbao Metro 05 2012 2111.jpg|thumb|Metro entrance in Moyua, called "''fosteritos''" after designer Norman Foster]]
[[File:Euskotren Tranbia Uribitarte2016.jpg|thumb|Tram unit leaving the Uribitare stop]]
Public transport by rail and bus is organised by the ''Bizkaiko Garraio Partzuergoa'' (Consortium of the Biscayan Transport). The consortium manages the [[Barik card]], a form of [[electronic ticket]] valid across almost all public transport systems of the [[Bilbao metropolitan area]] and [[Biscay]] province, as well as some other selected services in other provinces of the Basque autonomous community.

The mass transit rail system is divided into different networks managed by separate operators. [[Bilbao metro]], established in 1995, operates two underground lines with some overground sections ([[Line 1 (Metro Bilbao)|Line 1]] and [[Line 2 (Metro Bilbao)|Line 2]]). These two lines connect the metropolitan area following the estuary on both sides, starting in [[Etxebarri]] in the south all the way to [[Plentzia]] and [[Santurtzi]] by the coast. Line 1 was built following largely the same route as the Bilbao-Las Arenas railway, which was still active by the time the Metro system opened in 1995 and since has been replaced by it. The metro system stations were designed by [[Norman Foster]]. Line 3 of metro is operated by [[Euskotren Trena]], which also operates the regional services to Durango and Eibar as well as a commuter rail line that connects the centre of Bilbao with [[Lezama]] and the Txorierri valley. This third line of metro was inaugurated on 8 April 2017 and is expected to be extended to the [[Bilbao Airport|airport]] in the near future. Projects for a fourth and fifth line exist and are currently being studied.

Euskotren also operates a [[Bilbao tram|tramway line]] under the brand [[Euskotren Tranbia]]. The line follows the estuary of Bilbao across the central districts of the city, starting in the [[Bilbao-Atxuri Station]] and connecting important areas like the Guggenheim museum and the San Mamés football stadium. The original tram network started operations in 1876 and gradually expanded across the city to finally shut down in the 1960s due to being largely replaced by urban buses. The new tram system was opened on 18 December 2002, almost forty years after the closing of the original system.

[[Renfe Operadora|Renfe]] operates four commuter-rail lines in a system separate from the metro. Three of them operate under the [[Cercanías]] brand and are collectively known as ''[[Cercanías Bilbao]]'', while a fourth line is operated by Renfe Feve. The three lines operated under the Cercanías name operate largely overground and travel larger distances than the metro system, reaching municipalities outside of the metropolitan area such as [[Muskiz]] or even outside of the Biscay province, like [[Amurrio]]. The three lines all start in the [[Bilbao-Abando railway station]], whereas the line operated by Renfe Feve starts in the Bilbao-Concordia station.

The gaps in the railway service are covered by an extensive bus network. The urban bus system is operated under the brand [[Bilbobus]] and has 28 regular bus lines, 8 microbus lines and 8 night buses collectively known as ''Gautxori'' (night owl). The Bilbaobus network is limited to the city limits, and only a few lines extend beyond it. The [[BizkaiBus]] network fills this gap, with more than 100 lines, connecting the city with all other municipalities in the metropolitan area, as well as with most towns in [[Biscay]] and some in [[Álava]].

A [[Brittany Ferries]] ferry service links Santurtzi, near Bilbao, to [[Portsmouth]] (UK). [[MV Cap Finistère]] ferry departs from the [[port of Bilbao]], {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} north west of the town centre. A service operated by [[Trasmediterranea|Acciona Trasmediterranea]] served the same route from 16 May 2006 until April 2007. [[P&O Ferries]] operated this route until its withdrawal on 28 September 2010 with a ship called the [[Pride of Bilbao]].

===Public transportation statistics===
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bilbao, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 35 minutes. Three percent of public transit passengers ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 7 minutes, while 4% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is {{Convert|6.9|km|mi|abbr=on}}, while 10% travel more than {{Convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} in a single direction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_Spain_Bilbao-1505|title=Bilbao Public Transportation Statistics|publisher=Global Public Transit Index by Moovit|access-date=19 June 2017}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50x50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [[creativecommons:by/4.0/|Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence]].</ref>

=== Healthcare ===
[[File:Bilbao - Hospital Universitario de Basurto 10.jpg|thumb|right|University Hospital of Basurto]]
The public healthcare system is served and managed by the Basque healthcare system (''[[Osakidetza]]''), which has a network of medical centres established across the city. The most relevant hospital of the city is the Basurto Hospital, located in the [[Basurto-Zorroza]] district. It was opened in 1908 after ten years of construction, and it was built due to the fast increase of population in the late 19th century. Its design was based on the [[University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf|Eppendorf Hospital]] of [[Hamburg]], in (Germany), one of the most modern at the time.<ref>{{cite news |last=González |first=Carlos |title=A Hundred Years of the Basurto Hospital |url=http://servicios.elcorreodigital.com/aniversario/hospital-basurto/historia.html |work=El Correo Digital |access-date=2 December 2008 |archive-date=26 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226060251/http://servicios.elcorreodigital.com/aniversario/hospital-basurto/historia.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2008 the hospital was named the best hospital in customer support in Spain.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Basurto wins the award of best hospital in customer care |url=http://www.deia.com/es/digital/bizkaia/2008/11/11/514635.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124075612/http://www.deia.com/es/digital/bizkaia/2008/11/11/514635.php|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 January 2009|work=Deia|date=11 November 2008 |access-date=9 September 2018}}</ref>

However, the two largest hospitals that provide healthcare services to the inhabitants of the city are located outside of the city limits: the University Hospital of Gurutzeta/Cruces in neighbouring [[Barakaldo]] and the Galdakao-Usansolo Hospital in [[Galdakao]]. Other minor public hospitals located in the city include the Santa Marina Hospital and the Hospital of Urduliz, located in the metropolitan area.

=== Utilities ===
[[File:Petroleo birfindegia eta Muskiz.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Oil refinery in Muskiz]]
The headquarters of ''[[Iberdrola]]'', a [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[electric utility]] company are located in Bilbao. The company was created in 1992 after the merging of ''[[Iberduero]]'' and ''Hidroeléctrica Española'' and it is in charge of production and distribution of electricity. There are two [[thermal power station]]s located in the city's surroundings, one in [[Santurtzi]] and the other in [[Zierbena]]. The electricity produced in both these stations is then transferred to the [[electrical substation]] of [[Güeñes]] by the company ''[[Red Eléctrica de España]]'', which is the company responsible of moving electricity from the production stations to the final consumers. There is a [[combined cycle]] power station in the municipality of [[Amorebieta-Etxano|Amorebieta]] called ''Bizkaia Energia'', whose energy is transferred to the substation of [[Gatika]].

The supply of all oil-based fuels distributed in the whole metropolitan area (gasoline, [[diesel fuel]] and [[butane]]) are produced in the [[oil refinery]] owned by ''[[Petronor]]'' in the municipalities of [[Muskiz]] and [[Abanto y Ciérbana-Abanto Zierbena|Abanto Zierbena]]. ''Petronor'' is a large oil company founded in Bilbao in 1968 and it currently comprises two partners, [[Repsol]] (85.98%) and [[Kutxabank]] (14.02%).

Supply of [[drinking water]] is managed by the ''Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Bizkaia'' (Bilbao Bizkaia Water Consortium), a public entity with the responsibility of managing the water infrastructure and distribution to many Biscayan municipalities, Bilbao and its metropolitan area included.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.consorciodeaguas.eus/Web/QuienesSomos/competencias.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171120021832/http://www.consorciodeaguas.eus/Web/QuienesSomos/competencias.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=2017-11-20 |title=Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Bizkaia |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=n.d. |website=Consorcio de Aguas |publisher=Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Bizkaia |access-date=16 September 2018 }}</ref> The supply of drinking water for the city comes from the [[Reservoir of Ullíbarri-Gamboa|Uribarri-Ganboa]] and Urrunaga reservoirs, which are fed by the river [[Zadorra]].

=== Higher education ===
Two universities are seated in Bilbao. The older is the [[University of Deusto]], founded by the [[Society of Jesus]] in 1886. It took its name from the then independent municipality of [[Deusto]], annexed to Bilbao in 1925. It was the only higher education institute in the borough until the establishment in 1968 of the University of Bilbao, later to become the [[University of the Basque Country]] in 1980. This public university, which has a presence in the three provinces of the autonomous community, has its main Biscayan campus in the municipality of [[Leioa]], although the Technical and Business faculties are based in Bilbao.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ehu.es/p200-content/es/contenidos/enlace/listado_centros/es_centros/centros.html | title = Centros | publisher = [[University of the Basque Country|UPV-EHU]] | access-date = 5 December 2010 | archive-date = 23 September 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100923014746/http://www.ehu.es/p200-content/es/contenidos/enlace/listado_centros/es_centros/centros.html | url-status = live }}</ref> Since 2014, [[Mondragon University]] has also a presence in the city through the innovation and entrepreneurial centre Bilbao Innovation Factory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mondragon.edu/en/actuality/news/news/mondragon-unibertsitatea-opens-a-branch-in-bilbao |title=Mondragon Unibertsitatea opens a branch in Bilbao |publisher=[[University of Mondragón]] |access-date=3 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904074127/http://www.mondragon.edu/en/actuality/news/news/mondragon-unibertsitatea-opens-a-branch-in-bilbao |archive-date=4 September 2015  }}</ref> In 2015, the offer of higher education in the city was expanded with the foundation of Dantzerti, the Higher School of Dramatic Arts and Dance of the Basque Country.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.deia.com/2015/09/24/ocio-y-cultura/cultura/dantzerti-inicia-su-andadura-oficial-buscando-retener-el-talento-en-euskadi | title = Dantzerti inicia su andadura oficial buscando retener el talento en Euskadi | publisher = Deia | access-date = 18 October 2015 | archive-date = 29 September 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150929090318/http://www.deia.com/2015/09/24/ocio-y-cultura/cultura/dantzerti-inicia-su-andadura-oficial-buscando-retener-el-talento-en-euskadi | url-status = dead }}</ref>
