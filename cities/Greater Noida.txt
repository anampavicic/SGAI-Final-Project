== Etymology ==
Initially, developers coined the term ”Noida Extension” to differentiate it from [[Noida]] but also was adjacent to the latter. The Greater Noida Authority later declared that the area would be referred to as 'Greater Noida West'.<ref>{{cite news |first=Vandana |last=Keelor |date=15 September 2012 |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/noida-extension-to-now-be-called-greater-noida-west/articleshow/16403369.cms |title=Noida Extension to now be called Greater Noida (West) |work=The Times of India, Noida News |access-date=26 May 2023}}</ref>

==History==
In the early 1980s, the [[Government of India]] realised that the rapid rate at which Delhi was expanding would result in chaos. Hence, they planned to develop residential and industrial areas around the capital to reduce the demographic burden. Before Greater Noida City, two areas had been developed—[[Gurgaon]], across the border from [[Haryana]], and [[Noida]], across the border with Uttar Pradesh.

Greater Noida Notified Area – 38000 Ha (380&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) comprising 124 villages.<ref name="Area"/> Noida's infrastructure was carefully laid out, but the 1990s saw huge growth in the [[Indian economy]]. Migration to cities like Delhi, [[Mumbai]], Kolkata, [[Chennai]], Hyderabad and Bangalore exceeded planning estimates. Noida was developed to accommodate population growth for 20–25 years. The massive population influx from [[Delhi]], however, caused it to overload in a mere 15 years, although [[infill|intake]] is not complete and [[illegal mining]] remains a problem.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Police, mining mafia exchange fire in Noida|date=1 May 2014|newspaper=the Times of India|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/Police-mining-mafia-exchange-fire-in-Noida/articleshow/34472318.cms|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502054509/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/Police-mining-mafia-exchange-fire-in-Noida/articleshow/34472318.cms|archive-date=2 May 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>
[[File:Bismil Park2811.JPEG|thumb|200px|[[Ram Prasad Bismil|Shaheed Bismil Park]], Sector-Beta 1 in Greater Noida City]]

The [[government of Uttar Pradesh]] decided to develop another city as an extension to Noida with better [[Urban planning|planning]]. The idea was to create a world-class town approximately 25 kilometres from Noida. A railway station near [[Boraki Railway Station|Boraki]] and an international airport were included later in the plan intending to develop Greater Noida as an independent city.

During the 1990s, the Noida extension (now a part of [[Gautam Buddh Nagar]]) became what is today known as Greater Noida. The Greater NOIDA Authority manages the development of the city. Greater Noida is connected to [[Agra]] by the six-lane [[Yamuna Expressway]]. The [[Buddh International Circuit]] was used to hold the Indian Grand Prix in 2011, 2012 and 2013 before the premature cancellation of the contract. The [[Indian motorcycle Grand Prix|Indian MotoGP]] was held here in 2023.

Roads are wide with service lanes for every major road. The sectors are named by letters of the [[Greek alphabet]]. All cabling and utilities have been built underground. Alpha, Beta, and Gamma are the oldest sectors. The other emerging sectors include Xi, Delta, Mu, Omicron and Tau. The present GNIDA office is in Gamma&nbsp; II sector just opposite the historical village Rampur Jagir/Jahangir where the revolutionary [[Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil]] lived in 1919 when he was hidden underground after the [[Mainpuri]] conspiracy. A park has been named "Amar Shaheed Pt. Ram Prasad Bismil Udyan" by the Uttar Pradesh Government.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite news |title=वतन की ख्वाहिशों पे जिंदगानी कुर्बान(en:Sacrifice of life for homeland) |newspaper= Dainik Jagran ([[Hindi]] Jagran City-Greater Noida) [[New Delhi]]|page=24 |date=12 August 2012 }}</ref>

The cold waves from the Himalayan region make the winters in Greater Noida very chilly. Temperatures fall to as low as 3 to 4&nbsp;°C at the peak of winter. In January, a dense fog envelopes the city, reducing visibility on the streets.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
