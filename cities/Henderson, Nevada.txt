'''Henderson''' is a city in [[Clark County, Nevada]], United States, about {{convert|16|mi}} southeast of downtown [[Las Vegas]]. It is the [[List of cities in Nevada|2nd most populous city]] in [[Nevada]], after Las Vegas, with an estimated population of 320,189 in 2019. The city is part of the [[Las Vegas Valley]]. Henderson occupies the southeastern end of the valley, at an elevation of {{Convert|1864|ft}}.

Henderson is known for its supply of [[magnesium]] during [[World War II]]. With the decline of magnesium production, the Nevada legislature approved a bill that gave Nevada's Colorado River Commission the authority to purchase the industrial plants, and Henderson was incorporated in 1953. Henderson is the location of [[Lake Las Vegas]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/lake-las-vegas-properties-change-hands/ |title=Lake Las Vegas properties change hands |date=January 10, 2008 |website=Las Vegas Review-Journal|language=en-US|access-date=June 14, 2019}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Charles B. Henderson.jpg|thumb|upright|Henderson was named in honor of [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Charles Henderson (Nevada politician)|Charles Henderson]].]]
The township of Henderson first emerged in the 1940s during World War II with the building of the Basic Magnesium Plant. Henderson quickly became the main supplier of [[magnesium]] in the United States, which was called the "miracle metal" of World War II.<ref>Lelande Quick, Miracle Metal from Nevada Hills, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/2097157/194406DesertMagazine1944June?page=10 Desert Magazine, June 1944], pages 10-13</ref> The plant supplied the [[United States Department of War|US War Department]] with magnesium for incendiary munition casings and airplane engines, frames, and other parts. A quarter of all US wartime magnesium came from the Henderson Plant to strengthen [[aluminum]], using 25% of [[Hoover Dam]]'s power to separate the metal from its ore by [[electrolysis]].<ref name=magnes>Moore, David. [http://www.romanconcrete.com/docs/hooverdam/hooverdam.htm The Hoover Dam: A World Renowned Concrete Monument] ''Roman Concrete'', 1999. Accessed: February 26, 2012.</ref> 

Although "born in America's defense", Henderson's future after World War II was uncertain. In 1947, magnesium production was no longer necessary for defense, and most of the Black Mountain Industrial (BMI) Complex's 14,000 employees moved away. Enrollment in the school system was reduced by two thirds, and well over half the townsite houses, built to house plant workers, became vacant. In 1947, the United States War Asset Administration offered Henderson for sale as war surplus property.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cityofhenderson.com/government/departments/mayor-and-council/our-history |title=Our History &#124; Henderson, NV }}</ref>

With the help of local industry, Henderson was incorporated on April 16, 1953, as the City of Henderson. On May 23, 1953, Henderson, with its population of 7,410, elected Dr. Jim French as the first mayor. Originally only about {{convert|13|sqmi|km2}} in size, the city quickly began to grow, reaching over {{convert|100|sqmi|km2}} in size in 2022.<ref>[https://www.cityofhenderson.com/our-city/about-henderson/history#:~:text=With%20the%20help%20of%20local,began%20to%20grow%20and%20flourish.

=== Ammonium perchlorate factory fire===
{{Main|PEPCON disaster}}
Pacific Engineering and Production Company of Nevada (PEPCON) was incorporated in Henderson, Nevada, about seven miles southeast of Las Vegas, in November 1955 by Edgar J. Marston (La Jolla, California), Fred D. Gibson Sr. (Las Vegas, Nevada), and John V. Mueller (Reno, Nevada). Initially, PEPCON provided consulting services specializing in mining and chemical plant design. It was also the operator of a chlorine gas packaging plant (servicing area businesses that had swimming pools) and a sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) manufacturing operation using the brand name "Boulder White".

On May 4, 1988, 10:40&nbsp;am the Pacific Engineering and Production Company of Nevada (PEPCON) Ammonium perchlorate manufacture, a crystallized oxygen, in the modern-day Gibson Business Park of Henderson, caught fire.{{clarify|date=February 2024|reason=sentence is incongruent}} After complaining of the smell of Mercaptan, an odorant added to natural gas, for 2 weeks prior to the explosion on May 4, 1988. The blaze quickly engulfed the factory, smoke, and flames from the building, eventually obliterating it in a massive explosion, followed by six smaller explosions. Smoke was seen from {{convert|100|mi}} away, and two major blasts measured 3.0 and 3.5, respectively, on the [[Richter magnitude scale]] at observatories in [[California]] and [[Colorado]].<ref name="nasa-2012"/> These explosions sent shockwaves throughout Henderson and parts of the [[Las Vegas Valley]] that shattered glass and damaged buildings. Two people were killed and 372 were injured. Investigators surveying the damage in the surrounding communities estimated the blast as similar to a 1-[[kiloton]] [[air burst]] [[nuclear detonation]].<ref name="nasa-2012">{{cite journal|title=From Rockets to Ruins: The PEPCON Ammonium Perchlorate Plant Explosion|journal=NASA Safety Center System Failure Case Study|date=November 2012|volume=6|issue=9|url=https://sma.nasa.gov/docs/default-source/safety-messages/safetymessage-2012-11-05-pepconexplosion-vits.pdf?sfvrsn=6|access-date=August 7, 2013}}</ref> The full report can be found in the book: A Brief History: Pacific Engineering and Production Company of Nevada – January 14, 2016 {{ISBN|1-5144-3524-1}}.

The events of the PEPCON spurred new development in Henderson years later, from its historical industrial development to residential and commercial development. There are now no signs of the explosion where it happened. Today, the site consists mostly of office buildings.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}<ref>{{Cite book |last=Thayer |first=Dave |title=A Brief History: Pacific Engineering and Production Company of Nevada |date=January 14, 2016 |publisher=Amazon |isbn=978-1-5144-3524-3 |edition=1st |location=Henderson, NV |publication-date=January 14, 2016 |pages=1–26 |language=English}}</ref>

In 2013, the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ) announced it had reached a cooperative settlement agreement with the city of Henderson under the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA).

One of the complainants was arrested and detained for two days in the Henderson [[detention facility]], while the other was an alleged [[crime victim]].<ref name="doj-2013">{{cite web|title=Justice Department Reaches Settlement with the City of Henderson, Nev. to Improve Law Enforcement Communications with People Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2013/August/13-crt-881.html|publisher=US Department of Justice|access-date=August 7, 2013|author=Department of Justice Office of Public Affairs|date=August 5, 2013}}</ref>

During its investigation into the allegations, the department inquired whether the city of Henderson would be interested in resolving the matter voluntarily. The city expressed its full commitment to ensure compliance with the ADA. Under the settlement, the city of Henderson will pay $35,000 to the complainants. The city agreed to provide [[sign language]] interpreters, usually within an hour of a person's request to law enforcement officers. Henderson also agreed to modify its handcuffing policies for people who use sign language or hand writing to communicate, and to adopt other policies consistent with the ADA.<ref name="doj-2013"/>

===Television===
[[KVVU-TV]] (channel 5) is the Las Vegas Valley's [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate and licensed to Henderson, and is based from studios on the northwest side of the city.

==Transportation==
The city is served by [[RTC Transit]] (formerly Citizens Area Transit/CAT) with its network of bus routes which run throughout the [[Las Vegas Valley]].

Henderson is served by four major highways: Henderson Black Hills and ([[Nevada State Route 582|State Route 582]]), which is the main thoroughfare connecting with Las Vegas and [[Boulder City, Nevada|Boulder City]]; [[Lake Mead Parkway]] ([[Nevada State Route 564|State Route 564]]); [[Interstate 11 (Nevada)|Interstate 11]] and [[Interstate 215 (Nevada)|Interstate 215]]. [[Nevada State Route 146|State Route 146]], also known as Saint Rose Parkway, connects [[Interstate 15 (Nevada)|Interstate 15]] near [[Sloan, Nevada|Sloan]] with Interstate 215 in Green Valley. This stretch is formally a part of Lake Mead Parkway which is a direct link to Henderson for motorists traveling in and out of [[Southern California]].

The city of Henderson has a low percentage of households without a car. In 2015, 2.8 percent of Henderson households lacked a car, and increased to 5 percent in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Henderson averaged 1.74 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Car Ownership in U.S. Cities Data and Map|journal=Governing|date=December 9, 2014|url=http://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html|access-date=May 4, 2018}}</ref>

Henderson is home for the [[Henderson Executive Airport]]. The main airport for the metropolitan area is [[Harry Reid International Airport]], northwest of Henderson.

Street numbering is different within the city of Henderson than with the rest of the Las Vegas Valley. The center of Henderson lies within the intersection of Water Street and Lake Mead Parkway. The Henderson Police Department for years referred to Lake Mead Parkway (and its former name Lake Mead Drive) as "146", while Boulder Highway is often referred as "93", its former highway designation.

The [[Union Pacific Railroad]] serves Henderson over a branch line originally built to support construction of [[Hoover Dam]]. The final few miles of the line, owned by the U.S. Government, were abandoned after the dam was completed. The line still extends to [[Boulder City, Nevada|Boulder City]]; in 1985, the state purchased the section east of appropriately [[Interstate 11|I-11]], with the [[Nevada Southern Railroad Museum]] operating excursion trains over the easternmost seven miles (11&nbsp;km).
