'''Bafoussam''' is the capital and largest city of the [[West Region (Cameroon)|West Region]] of [[Cameroon]], in the [[Bamboutos Mountains]]. It is the 3rd most important (financially) city in Cameroon, after [[Yaoundé]] and [[Douala]]. The ''communauté urbaine'' (Urban Community) of Bafoussam, is a decentralized territorial collectivity. Originally called Urban Commune of Bafoussam, the communauté urbaine (Urban Community) of Bafoussam, was born after the Presidential Decree N ° 2008/022 of January 17, 2008 and composed of three communes, namely: the Commune of Bafoussam I (Bafoussam proper), the Commune of Bafoussam II ([[Baleng]]) and the Commune of Bafoussam III ([[Bamougoum]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cubafoussam.cm/?page_id=122|title=Presentation de la CUB|website=Communauté Urbaine de Bafoussam|access-date=28 April 2018|archive-date=29 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429030046/http://www.cubafoussam.cm/?page_id=122|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The city had an urban population of 347,517 inhabitants (at the 2008 Census). Bafoussam is the [[West Region (Cameroon)|West Region]] centre of trade, and people are farming [[coffee]], [[Potato]]es, [[maize]] and [[beans]]. The city has also a coffee processing facility and [[brewery]]. It is the main city of the [[Bamiléké]] people and is home to the Bafoussam chief's palace. Bafoussam is a group composed of 07 villages (Bamendzi, Banengo, Ndiangdam, Ndiangsouoh, Ndiangbou, Toukouop, Ngoueng, and Banengo city B) with 46 districts or sub-villages. The main neighborhoods of the city are Banengo, Djeleng, Famla (also called Akwa), Kamkop, Quartier Eveché, Quartier Haussa and Tamdja.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://mairiebafoussam.com/index.php/bafoussam/histoire-de-bafoussam|title=Histoire de Bafoussam|website=Marie de Bafoussam 1er|access-date=26 February 2018|archive-date=11 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190911095935/http://mairiebafoussam.com/index.php/bafoussam/histoire-de-bafoussam|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Bafoussam has two main markets (Marché A and Marché B), several internet cafés, restaurants and supermarkets, and a movie theater.  Most of Bafoussam nightlife centers on the area called Akwa (so-named in honor of the neighborhood in Douala).  Akwa features several bars, stores, and a live music venue, along with customary vendors of ''Soya'' (barbecue beef meat brochettes), ''Poisson braisé'' (barbecue fish) and other foods.<ref name=":0" />

This is the birthplace of the football player [[Geremi]] and his 17 brothers and sisters, as well as the birthplace of his cousins [[Pierre Webó]] and [[Guy Kouemou]].

== History ==
[[File:Chefferie Bafoussam - Case à palabres 01.jpg|thumb|left|Chiefdom - Bafoussam - Hut for palavers|alt=]] The Bafoussam people originate from the Bamileke ethnic group, which are the natives of the same region. Claims are made that the Bamileke were descendants of the [[Baladi]]s who left Egypt in the ninth century of our era. They arrived in the Tikar region around the middle of the twelfth century before dividing around 1360 when their last king, King Ndeh, died. Yende, the first prince, refused the throne and crossed the Nun (Noun river) to found the Bafoussam kingdom. His sister turned to the Banso area (there are about thirty Bamileke villages in the English-speaking North West). Two decades later, Ncharé, the youngest, went down to the plain of Noun to found the Bamoun kingdom. From Bafoussam were born almost all the other Bamileke Kingdoms, between the fifteenth century and the twentieth century (Bansoa was born in 1910 following the forced exile of Fo Taghe of Bafoussam)<ref>{{Cite book|title=Histoire et anthropologie du peuple bamiléké|last=Toukam|first=Dieudonné|publisher=L'Harmattan|year=2010|pages=242}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Parlons bamiléké|last=Toukam|first=Dieudonné|publisher=L'Harmattan|year=2008|location=Paris|pages=255}}</ref>

=== Name ===
Originally, Bafoussam is written in Bafoussam dialect "''Pe Foussan''" or "''Pe Fussep''" which literally means "people of ......". Over time, "Pe" has become "Ba" while retaining the same meaning.

When Westerners arrived, they united the two sound elements "''Pe''" and "''Foussan''" to make Bafoussam.

Another source, however, argues that Bafoussam is ''Fuh Sep''<nowiki/>'s "bad western translation", meaning "we earn more by selling in detail than wholesale". According to this version, the Bafoussam would be a people who bought wholesale to resell in detail or who sold in detail by measuring in small baskets. ''Fuh'' here means to measure and ''Sap'' or ''Sep'' which means profit or treasure, to symbolize by the small basket in which one sold in detail. ''Pefuhssap'' or ''Pefuhssep'' means "those who have discovered that profit (treasure) is in retail".

It is nevertheless noted that the two sources of information on the origin of the name Bafoussam are not contradictory and it is safe to say that the Bafoussam left their place of residence from the Tikar plain with their name since they already practiced retail trade with small baskets.<ref name=":0" />

=== Birth of Bafoussam city ===
In 1945, an unexpected meeting between the colonial administrator of the Bamileke region (during the colonial times, the present day West region was called the Bamileke region) and the monarch of ''Fu'sap (''Bafoussam''),'' Tchoumtchoua Paul, who ruled from 1933 to 1958, laid the foundation for increasing the importance of Bafoussam, which lied at the crossroads between British [[Southern Cameroons]] and [[French Cameroons|French Cameroon]].

By 1950, when Bafoussam became a subdivision of the French colonial administration headed by Jacques Lestrigang, very quickly, the village became cosmopolitan because located at the intercession of the tracks connecting the two Cameroon and also the cities charged with history that are [[Dschang]], [[Foumban]] and [[Ngaoundéré]]. Thus the first servicing plan was designed by the French architect Dufayard. Its execution, associated with the dynamism of the populations which occupied it, had to trigger the skyrocketing of the city. Then came his twinning with the city of [[Bayeux]], a city located in [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]], [[France]].
[[File:BEAC.jpg|thumb|[[Bank of Central African States|BEAC]] (Bafoussam branch) from across the road]]
As the saying goes "for souls nobly born, valor doesn't await the passing of years", Bafoussam replaced [[Dschang]] a few years later as the capital of the West Region (then West Province) and equally replaced Nkongsamba as the economic hub of the region. Thus, important economic operators including the [[Bank of Central African States|BEAC (Banque des Etats d'Afrique Centrale)]], [[Brasseries du Cameroun|Brasseries of Cameroon]], and other industrial units in the making orchestrated a rush to the new city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ficib.info/index.php/guide-bafoussam/item/181-naissance-et-evolution-de-la-ville-de-bafoussam|title=Naissance et Évolution de la Ville de Bafoussam|date=2017|website=Festival International du Cinema Independent de Bafoussam|access-date=26 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918064640/http://www.ficib.info/index.php/guide-bafoussam/item/181-naissance-et-evolution-de-la-ville-de-bafoussam|archive-date=18 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On July 10, 1959, five rebel leaders were shot in the market square.<ref>Thomas Deltombe, Manuel Domergue, Jacob Tatsita, KAMERUN !, La Découverte, 2019</ref>

== Geography ==

=== Topography ===
Bafoussam is built in the foothills of the Banengo and Baleng hills that are covered with savannah vegetation. The city, located at about 1500 meters above sea level is built on stairs on the perimeters of Tamdja neighborhoods (1st floor), shopping center and Djemoum (2nd floor), Djeleng (3rd floor) and lower corners called Mairie rurale and Tougang (4th level).
[[File:Famla neigbouhood in Bafoussam.jpg|thumb|A view of the Famla neighbourhood (commonly called Akwa) in Bafoussam]]

=== Climate ===
The climate is constantly cool with a temperature oscillating between 15 °C and 27&nbsp;°C. With climate change in recent years, Bafoussam sometimes reaches 28&nbsp;°C during the [[dry season]] that extends from mid-November to mid-March (four months). The [[Wet season|rainy season]] lasts eight months, from mid-March to mid-November.

[[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system]] classifies its climate as [[tropical savanna climate]] ('''Aw'''). However, its temperatures are lower than other locations with this classification due to its high elevation.

=== Waterfalls ===
The city is not very rich in natural rivers. The [[Mifi River]] runs along the southern part of the city to fall in the void creating the fall of the {{Interlanguage link|Metche|fr|Chutes_de_la_Métché#Phénomènes_liés|vertical-align=sup}}. Other small streams including Megang, Nlom, and Vava exist in the city. Next to the fall of the Metche, which is a real attraction, Lake Baleng (this crater lake) is also a tourist attraction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ficib.info/index.php/guide-bafoussam/item/182-geographie-physique-de-la-ville-de-bafoussam|title=Geographie physique de la ville de Bafoussam|website=Festival International du Cinema Independent de Bafoussam|access-date=26 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227034206/http://www.ficib.info/index.php/guide-bafoussam/item/182-geographie-physique-de-la-ville-de-bafoussam|archive-date=27 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Education ==
Bafoussam is home to a good number of high schools (including technical and vocational schools), many primary schools and kindergartens, and few institutions providing tertiary education. Most students upon graduation travel to other cities like [[Dschang]], [[Yaoundé|Yaounde]], [[Douala]], or [[Buea]] to attend university or other forms of tertiary institutions. It is important to note that in Cameroon, ''Lycée'' is the name given to government/public high schools, while ''Collège'' is the name given to privately funded high schools.

Cameroon has two official languages so it is common to find schools that offer education solely in English or French or both (so-called bilingual high schools)
