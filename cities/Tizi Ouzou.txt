'''Tizi Ouzou''' or '''Thizi Wezzu''' ({{Langx|ar|تيزي وزو}}, [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]]: '''Tizi Wezzu''') is a city in north central [[Algeria]], and capital of [[Tizi Ouzou Province]] and [[Tizi Ouzou District]]. It is among the largest cities in Algeria. It is the second most populous city in the [[Kabylia]] region after [[Béjaïa]].

==History==
===Foundation=== 
Tizi Ouzou was founded in 1856, after the successful expedition of France against Kabyle tribes.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Crescenzo |first=Jean de |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cXkEAwAAQBAJ&q=Tizi+Ouzou |title=Chroniques Tizi-ouziennes |date=2005 |publisher=Lulu.com |isbn=978-2-9525841-0-4 |language=fr |access-date=2023-10-30 |archive-date=2024-05-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240521145910/https://books.google.com/books?id=cXkEAwAAQBAJ&q=Tizi+Ouzou#v=snippet&q=Tizi%20Ouzou&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Etymology===
The name ''Tizi Ouzou'' is made up of two [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]] words: ''Tizi'' meaning [[col]], and ''Ouzou'' (from ''Azzu'') meaning [[Genisteae]]. The full name of the locality therefore means "the col of the Genisteae".<ref>Foudil Cheriguen, Toponymie algérienne des lieux habités (les noms composés), Alger, Épigraphe, 1993, p. 155-156</ref>

===Friction===
Islamists looted, and burned to the ground, a [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] church on 9 January 2010. The pastor was quoted as saying that worshipers fled when local police left a gang of local rioters unchecked.<ref>{{Cite news | agency=The Associated Press | title=Protestant Church Burned in Algeria | url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/01/11/world/AP-AF-Algeria-Burned-Temple.html| work=New York Times | location=New York, New York | date=11 January 2010 }}</ref>

==Geography==
This city is located in the heart of [[Kabylie]]. It is {{convert|102.36|km2}} in area. Tizi Ouzou is located in the valley of Assif N Sébaou. It is surrounded by mountains.

A portion of the old city of Tizi Ouzou (known as the High City) backed the east slopes of the mountain. At the top of the [[Rajaouna|mountain Belloua]] lies the village of Redjaouna. The latter is attached to the town of Tizi Ouzou.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
