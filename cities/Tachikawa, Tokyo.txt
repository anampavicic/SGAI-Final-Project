==History==
The area of present-day Tachikawa was part of ancient [[Musashi Province]] and was controlled from the [[Heian period]] through the [[Sengoku period]] by the Tachikawa clan. In the Edo period, it was little more than a village along the [[Koshu Kaido]]. In the post-[[Meiji Restoration]] cadastral reform of July 22, 1878, the area became part of [[Kitatama District, Tokyo|Kitatama District]] in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] In the [[Meiji period]], the opening of what would later become the [[Chuo Main Line]] in 1889 led to a large-scale land development and on April 1, 1889, with the establishment of the modern municipalities law, the village of Tachikawa was created. Kitatama District was transferred to the administrative control of Tokyo Metropolis on April 1, 1893. [[Tachikawa Airfield]] Was established in 1922 by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], and Tachikawa was elevated to town status the following year. On December 1, 1940, Tachikawa was elevated to city status. Before the war, Tachikawa was a military town centered on [[Tachikawa Airfield]], and even after the war, it was a major base for the U.S. military until 1977.

===Notable events===
On May 12, 2011, the robbery of the largest amount of money in Japanese history took place in the city.  At 3 a.m. that day, two men wearing masks broke into the office of a security company, bound the sole security guard, beat him until he revealed the code to the company's vault, and then made off with 70 bags of cash containing ¥604 million. The security guard, 36, was seriously injured. Hideaki Ueki, 31, Yutaka Watanabe, 41, Tsutomu Sakuma, 37, and three others were later arrested and charged with perpetrating the crime. All the men allegedly had ties to the [[Yakuza]].<ref>[[Kyodo News]], "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110602a3.html Man arrested, another wanted in nation's biggest cash robbery case]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 2 June 2011, p. 1.</ref><ref>[[Kyodo News]], "Sixth man apprehended over cash heist in Tachikawa", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 1 August 2011.</ref>
