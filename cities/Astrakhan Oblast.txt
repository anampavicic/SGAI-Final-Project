==Politics==
[[File:Здание городских учреждений 08.JPG|290px|thumb|Governor and Government of Astrakhan Oblast Administration Building on [[Sovetskaya Street]]]]

During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Astrakhan [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

The Charter of Astrakhan Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Astrakhan Oblast is the province's standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Administration, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].

===Legislature===
