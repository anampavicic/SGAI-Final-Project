==Geography==
{{stack|[[File:Achalm.jpg|thumb|150px|Achalm tower]]}}

Reutlingen is located about {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the State capital of Baden-Württemberg, [[Stuttgart]]. It lies in the Southwest corner of Germany, right next to the [[Swabian Jura]], and that is why it is often called ''The gateway to the [[Swabian Alps|Swabian Jura]]'' ({{langx|de|link=no|Das Tor zur Schwäbischen Alb}}). The [[Echaz]] river, a tributary of the [[Neckar]], flows through the city centre.

Along with the old [[college town|university town]] of [[Tübingen]] (about {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the west), Reutlingen is the centre of the [[Neckar-Alb]] region. It is also part of the larger [[Stuttgart Metropolitan Region]].

==History==
{{stack|[[File:Reütlingen.jpg|thumb|230px|Reütlingen – excerpt from ''Topographia Sueviae'' (Swabia), published by [[Matthäus Merian]] in 1643]]
[[File:Reutlingen, Andreas Kieser.png|thumb|230px|View of Reutlingen from the forest register books created by Andreas Kieser]]}}

The first settlements in the area are believed to date from the 4th or 5th century.
Some time around 1030, Count Egino started to build a castle on top of the ''Achalm'', one of the largest mountains in Reutlingen district (about 706 m). One of the towers of this castle was rebuilt in the 19th century and is open to visitors. The name ''Reutlingen'' was first mentioned in writing in the so-called ''Bempflingen Treaty'' ({{langx|de|link=no|Bempflinger Vertrag}}) which is dated approximately 1089–90.

Reutlingen's earliest documented mention dates back to 1089 in the Bempflingen Treaty, which was an inheritance agreement between Zwiefalten Monastery and the descendants of the Achalm Count. In 1180, Reutlingen was given market privileges by Frederick Barbarossa. The settlement of Reutlingen was likely concentrated around the present-day Katharinenstraße and Untere Wilhelmstraße due to strategic considerations.<ref>https://www.schule-bw.de/faecher-und-schularten/gesellschaftswissenschaftliche-und-philosophische-faecher/landeskunde-landesgeschichte/module/epochen/mittelalter/staedte/reutlingen/12geschichte.htm</ref><ref>See also Zwiefalter Chronik Ortliebs. MGH SS 10, p. 76.</ref>

Around 1180, Reutlingen received market rights and, between 1220 and 1240 it was promoted to [[German town law|city status]] and city-walls and fortifications were built. Shortly thereafter, from 1247 to 1343, the city's landmark, the [[St. Mary's Church, Reutlingen|St. Mary's Church]] ({{langx|de|link=no|Marienkirche}}) was built.

In 1377 Reutlingen was the scene of a victory by the [[Swabian League]], formed in the previous year by 14 Swabian cities, led by [[Ulm]], over the [[Count of Württemberg]]. In 1519, a later Swabian League came to Reutlingen's help when [[Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg]] attempted to seize the city; the League landed a crushing blow, conquering Württemberg and selling it to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].
In 1495 and 1516 the Jews were exiled from the city.<ref>[[Erich Keyser]] (Herausgeber): „Württembergisches Städtebuch"; Band IV Teilband Baden-Württemberg Band 2 aus „Deutsches Städtebuch. p. 99</ref>
 
As a result of such struggles, Reutlingen became an [[Imperial Free City|Imperial City]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], free from allegiance to the [[Duke of Württemberg]]. In 1530, Reutlingen's city council signed the [[Augsburg Confession]], and in 1580 and the Formula of Concord, key documents of [[Lutheranism]]. In 1803, in the wake of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], Reutlingen lost its independence in the [[German Mediatisation]], being restored to [[Electorate of Württemberg|Württemberg]].

The worst disaster in the history of Reutlingen happened in 1726, when a major fire swept through the city, destroying 80% of all residential houses and almost all public buildings, and making 1,200 families homeless. The impact of this fire, which lasted three days, is still visible today.

During [[World War II]], the wings of the [[V-1 (flying bomb)|V-1 flying bomb]] were manufactured in Reutlingen, making the city the target of several allied bombing raids.

The reconstruction of Reutlingen and its democratization is closely linked to the name Oskar Kalbfells, who was the first democratically elected mayor of the city to shape Reutlingen's political history until 1973 after [[World War II]].

In 1947 Reutlingen came to the newly founded state of [[Württemberg-Hohenzollern]], which merged with the state of Baden-Württemberg in 1952.

On 24 July 2016 a Syrian killed a pregnant woman in a [[2016 Reutlingen knife attack|machete attack]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Darko Janjevic|title=Police arrest Syrian man after woman killed in knife attack in Germany|url=http://www.dw.com/en/police-arrest-syrian-man-after-woman-killed-in-knife-attack-in-germany/a-19424224|access-date=25 July 2016|publisher=Deutsche Welle|quote=An attacker has allegedly killed one woman and injured five in the city of Reutlingen in southwest Germany, according to local police.}}</ref>
