The main [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] and largest city is [[Marseille]], France's third largest city after [[Paris]] and [[Lyon]]  and the 2nd largest [[urban area]] when combined with [[Aix-en-Provence|aix en Provence]] with slightly less than one million residents.

== History ==
The region is roughly coterminous with the former [[Provinces of France|French province]] of [[Provence]], with the addition of the following adjacent areas: the former [[Pope|papal]] territory of [[Avignon]], known as [[Comtat Venaissin]]; the former [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinian-Piedmontese]] [[County of Nice]] annexed in 1860, whose coastline is known in English as the [[French Riviera]] and in French as the ''Côte d'Azur''; and the southeastern part of the former French province of [[Dauphiné]], in the [[French Alps]]. Previously known by the acronym PACA, the region adopted the name ''Région Sud'' as a commercial name or nickname in December 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2017/12/16/la-provence-alpes-cote-d-azur-ne-sera-plus-surnommee-paca-mais-region-sud_5230750_3224.html|title=La Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur ne sera plus surnommée " PACA " mais " région Sud "|newspaper=Le Monde.fr|date=December 16, 2017|via=Le Monde}}</ref> [[File:1789 + 2022 Provence, noms.png|thumb|left|300px|The region Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur and its departments on the background of historical territories]]

The largest cities in the region are [[Marseille]] (regional prefecture), [[Nice]], [[Toulon]] and [[Aix-en-Provence]], each with a population exceeding 100,000 inhabitants at the 1999 census. After Marseille, Nice is the second most populous city in the region, with a city proper population of about 350,000 and an urban population exceeding 1 million.

Marseille has an urban area of 2 million inhabitants and is the largest and capital city of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region. It is also the second-most populated city in France, just behind [[Paris]], and the city with the third-largest metropolitan population in France, behind Paris and [[Lyon]], respectively.

Along with Nice and Marseille, the region is also made internationally popular with [[Cannes]], a city that, despite its comparatively small size (population of 73,603 in 2012), hosts the annual [[Cannes Film Festival]], which has highly popularized the region. In addition, [[Arles]] has become renowned as the city where [[Vincent van Gogh]] lived and painted 300 paintings.

Toulon is a large military harbour on the Mediterranean coast and is home to a French naval base. It is the capital of the Var department in the region. Also, Aix-en-Provence has long been a university town and, to this day, remains the most important educational centre in the region.

Below is a list of the most populated cities in the region along with their population (city proper) according to the most recent census:

==Geography==

This region has a total area of {{convert|31400|km2|abbr=on}}. It has a wide variety of landscapes, from the [[Alps]] mountains to plains, lakes such as the [[Gignoux Lake]], and coastal areas like [[Nice]] and [[Marseille]], which form the majority of the land area. The region has a [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coastline on the south, on which the majority of its population lives. It borders [[Italy]] ([[Liguria]] and [[Piedmont]]) to the east, [[Monaco]] ([[Fontvieille, Monaco|Fontvieille]], [[La Colle, Monaco|La Colle]], [[La Rousse]], [[Larvotto]], [[Les Moneghetti]], [[Les Révoires]], [[Saint Michel, Monaco|Saint Michel]]) in the south-east, and the French regions of [[Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes]] to the north and [[Occitania (administrative region)|Occitanie]] to the west. The [[Rhône]], [[Durance]], [[Var (river)|Var]] and [[Arc (Provence)|Arc]] rivers run through the region. The borders were unaffected by the 2016 French regional reforms.

This region is famous for the Côte d'Azur ([[French Riviera]]), which spans the coastal cities of [[Nice]], [[Saint-Laurent-du-Var]], [[Antibes]], [[Juan-les-Pins]], [[Cannes]], [[Mandelieu-la-Napoule]], [[Fréjus]], [[Saint-Raphaël, Var|Saint-Raphaël]], [[Sainte-Maxime]] and [[Saint-Tropez]]; and on the [[Rhône]] river, the city of [[Avignon]] which is surrounded by [[Walls of Avignon|medieval stone walls]].

==Regional government and politics==
[[File:Langfr-400px-Logo PACA 2018.png|thumb|Regional logo]]
The [[Regional Council of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] is the legislative body (''assemblée délibérante'') of the region. The [[President of the Regional Council (France)|President of the Regional Council]] has been [[Renaud Muselier]] formerly of [[The Republicans (France)|The Republicans]] (LR) since 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Speaker Renaud MUSELIER|url=https://www.iucncongress2020.org/programme/speakers/renaud-muselier|access-date=2021-12-29|website=IUCN World Conservation Congress 2020|language=en}}</ref>

===Political tendencies===
In the recent years, [[The Republicans (France)|The Republicans]] have gained strong support in the region. Following the [[2015 Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur regional election|2015 regional election]], the party took control of the regional executive, which had been previously controlled by the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (PS). [[Christian Estrosi]] succeeded [[Michel Vauzelle]] as President of the Regional Council. The 2015 election was also a show of force for the [[National Rally|National Front]] (FN), led by [[Marion Maréchal|Marion Maréchal-Le Pen]], which garnered over 45% of the vote in the second round.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Elections régionales 2015 : Christian Estrosi l'emporte face à Marion Maréchal-Le Pen|url=https://www.europe1.fr/politique/elections-regionales-2015-christian-estrosi-lemporte-face-a-marion-marechal-le-pen-2634997|access-date=2021-12-29|website=Europe 1|language=fr}}</ref> The Socialist Party lost all representation at the regional level.

The [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) historically had several strongholds in the region from the 1920s onward, including [[Aubagne]], [[Draguignan]], [[La Ciotat]], [[Beausoleil, Alpes-Maritimes|Beausoleil]], [[Martigues]], [[Gardanne]], [[Arles]] as well as some suburbs of [[Marseille]], although not enough to win regional elections; the party usually received about 10% of the vote. In the 2002 presidential election, this declined to 4%.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur : Résultats de l'élection présidentielle 2002|url=https://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/politique/elections/presidentielle-2002/resultats-elections/region-provence-alpes-cote-d-azur.html|access-date=2021-12-29|website=LExpress.fr|language=fr}}</ref> In 2007, it dropped below 2%.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Résultats élection présidentielle 2007 France entière|url=https://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/politique/elections/presidentielle-2007/resultats-elections/france.html|access-date=2021-12-29|website=LExpress.fr|language=fr}}</ref>

Nowadays the main competition in regional politics is between the right-wing The Republicans and the far-right National Rally (formerly National Front).<ref>{{Cite web|last=Brustier|first=Gaël|date=2021-05-21|title=Les Républicains et le Rassemblement national: attrape-moi si tu peux!|url=http://www.slate.fr/story/209396/les-republicains-rassemblement-national-paca-droite-alliances-elections-regionales-2021|access-date=2021-12-30|website=Slate.fr|language=fr-FR}}</ref> In the second round of the [[2021 French regional elections|2021 regional election]], The Republicans received 57.3% of the vote against the National Rally's 42.7% with a list led by [[Thierry Mariani]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Régionales 2021 en Paca : Renaud Muselier ( LR) élu devant Thierry Mariani (RN), réactions et résultats|url=https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/provence-alpes-cote-d-azur/direct-regionales-2021-en-paca-decouvrez-les-resultats-du-second-tour-2154181.html|access-date=2021-12-30|website=France 3 Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur|language=fr-FR}}</ref> The Socialist Party, present in the first round on a joint list led by [[Europe Ecology – The Greens]], failed again to win any seats.

The [[2022 French presidential election|2022 presidential election]] marked the first time a far-right candidate won a majority of the vote in the second round in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur. [[Marine Le Pen]] won a majority of the vote in three of the six departments (55.1% in Var, 52% in Vaucluse and 51.5% in Alpes-de-Haute-Provence); her respective scores in the remaining three (49.9% in Alpes-Maritimes, 47.9% in Bouches-du-Rhône and 44.9% in Hautes-Alpes) were superior to her national total (41.5%).<ref>[https://www.challenges.fr/politique/presidentielle-2022-decouvrez-la-carte-des-resultats-du-second-tour-en-provence-alpes-cote-d-azur_809082.amp "Présidentielle 2022: découvrez la carte des résultats du second tour en Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur"], ''[[Challenges (magazine)|Challenges]]'' (in French), 25 April 2022.</ref>

The region concentrates more on commercial activities than financial ones than the rest of France does; principally because of tourism. 34% of the labour force is employed in retail and trade, against 32% at the national level. Moreover, the sector strongly contributes to growth of added value (81.5% vs. 77.3% at the national level). The industrial sector (existing mainly through the [[Marseille-Fos Port]]), including construction, consists of 17.1% of regional employment (vs. 20.6% in the rest of France), and contributes to 9.3% of gross added value, 3.2 points below the French level.

Employment in the agricultural sector is lower than the national level (2.4% against 3.1%). However, it grew at a rate of 4.1% annually on average between 2000 and 2008, while the rest of the country saw its agricultural employment decline by 2.4%. According to the [[Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques|INSEE]], the region is characterised by a strong presence of SMEs of less than 500 employees, which represent 91.2% of local businesses (higher than the national average of 90.9%). Retail activities and tourism explain these figures.

The region's economy is dependent on tourism like most coastal places but also a majority of its economy is dependent on coastal activities. PACA is the 3rd richest French region and ranks 19th on the European scale. Its prosperity is mainly thanks to its attractiveness in terms of tourism; it is indeed one of the world's favourite tourist destinations, welcoming about 34 million tourists every year. The service sector predominates and provides many good jobs. In 2009, the region was admittedly affected by the global economic crisis, albeit to a small extent. It is (after the Paris area) the 2nd French region with regards to business startups.

If tourism is the driving force of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, the region is also a leader when it comes to innovative sectors, such as high technology, biotechnology, and microelectronics. Education, for its part, is well developed with the region's various universities, international schools, preparatory classes for specialist university courses, and engineering and business schools. All these institutions of higher learning help contribute to the human capital needed by the region to meet current technological challenges.

The region has a total GDP (2018) of €166.4 billion (US$188.7 bn), the sixth highest in France.<ref>{{Cite web|title=France's GDP by region|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/1085639/gdp-france-region/|access-date=2021-12-30|website=Statista|language=en}}</ref> It has a per capita GDP of €30,864 (US$34,994),<ref>{{Cite web|title=GDP per capita in France 2015|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/469676/per-capita-gross-domestic-product-by-region-france/|access-date=2021-12-30|website=Statista|language=en}}</ref> slightly higher than the French average. According to a recent survey, a person living in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur has an average annual income of about €37,489 (US$45,755).

The region has been part of the [[Alps–Mediterranean Euroregion]] since 10 July 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2006-11-28|title=Alpes-Méditerranée : une nouvelle eurorégion est née|url=https://www.banquedesterritoires.fr/alpes-mediterranee-une-nouvelle-euroregion-est-nee|access-date=2021-12-30|website=Banque des Territoires|language=fr}}</ref>

== Culture ==

The region is one of the most visited of France, and has therefore many well-known museums, mostly in Marseille: the [[Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations]], the [[Musée Cantini]], the [[Musée Grobet-Labadié]], the [[Marseille History Museum]], the [[Musée des beaux-arts de Marseille]], the [[Musée de la Faïence de Marseille]] and the [[Muséum d'histoire naturelle de Marseille]] are some of the tourist spots of the city. However, other museums are internationally recognised, like the [[Musée Matisse (Nice)|Musée Matisse]], the [[Musée d'art moderne et d'art contemporain]], the [[Musée Marc Chagall]], the [[Musée international d'Art naïf Anatole Jakovsky]], the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nice]], the [[Musée National du Sport]] and the [[Muséum d'histoire naturelle de Nice]].

Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur has two of the busiest airports in France: [[Nice Côte d'Azur Airport]] (ranking third nationally after [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] and [[Orly Airport]]) and [[Marseille Provence Airport]] (ranking fifth nationally after [[Lyon–Saint-Exupéry Airport]]).<ref>{{Cite web|title=List of major airports in France|url=https://airmundo.com/en/countries/france/|access-date=2021-12-30|website=AirMundo|language=en}}</ref> Nice saw 14,485,423 people travelling through its airport in 2019,<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-01-15|title=L'aéroport de Nice a dépassé les 14 millions de passagers en 2019|url=https://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-eco/l-aeroport-de-nice-a-depasse-les-14-millions-de-passagers-en-2019-20200115|access-date=2021-12-30|website=LEFIGARO|language=fr}}</ref> while 10,151,743 used Marseille to fly.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Marseille dépasse les 10 millions de passagers {{!}} Air Journal|url=https://www.air-journal.fr/2020-01-17-marseille-depasse-les-10-millions-de-passagers-5217631.html|access-date=2021-12-30|language=fr-FR}}</ref> As of 2019, the third-busiest airport in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur is [[Toulon–Hyères Airport]] (507,199 passengers),<ref>{{Cite web|title=Union des Aéroports Français|url=https://www.aeroport.fr/view-statistiques/toulon-hyeres|access-date=2021-12-30|website=www.aeroport.fr}}</ref> ranking 27th nationally.

=== Motorways ===
The region is at the centre of a complex and dense motorway network, in the heart of Mediterranean coast. Motorways are operated by ASF, ESCOTA,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Les sociétés de VINCI Autoroutes|url=http://corporate.vinci-autoroutes.com/fr/presentation/societes-vinci-autoroutes|access-date=2021-12-30|website=corporate.vinci-autoroutes.com|language=fr}}</ref> SMTC, MPM (Marseille Metropolis) and DIR Med (State). In PACA, motorways have the particularity to serve the city centres of large cities, unlike other large cities of France. This is due to their comparatively early construction in relation to the motorways of France's other regions.

==== National services ====
Despite the importance of the region in the national economy and demography, the national services on conventional network are not very high due to the fact of the saturations of the tracks with high speed and regional trains.

* Services operated by [[SNCF]] Intercités:

[[File:Niolon-gare.jpg|thumb|Regional service making a stop at Niolon station in [[Le Rove]]]]
All regional train services are operated under the ZOU! brand used for interurban train and bus services funded by the region. All such services are part of the [[TER Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] network and operated by [[SNCF]] on behalf of the region, except for services on the line between Nice and Digne-les-Bains, which are operated by [[Chemins de fer de Provence]], a company owned by the region. In 2021 the region became the first in mainland France to open up TER services to competition, and after a tender process awarded a contract to [[Transdev]] to operate TER services on the Marseille-Nice line. Transdev is scheduled to commence operations in place of SNCF from June 2025.<ref>{{Cite news|title= Marseille-Nice becomes first French TER line to leave SNCF control|url= https://www.connexionfrance.com/news/marseille-nice-becomes-first-french-ter-line-to-leave-sncf-control/393049 |date=2021-10-29|work=The Connexion}}</ref>

The Regional Council of Provence-Alpes Côte d'Azur is the transport authority and defines the services in all region. An attractive fare permits to transport more than 100,000 passengers every day in 750 trains. Trains are leaving every 15, 20, 30, 60 or 120 minutes on each line.

The regional services operate on one set of tracks throughout the regions, which has led to delays and cancellations along the line. In 2016, during the second Council of the Year at the Region Hall in Marseille, in front of politicians and the new President of the Regional Council of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur [[Christian Estrosi]], the SNCF CEO, [[Guillaume Pepy]], has announced the impossibility of the company to respond to the demand. The [[Marseille-Saint-Charles Station]], the Marseille's main railway station cannot support more than 23 trains an hour and the tracks are too old and not enough to accept an average of the capacity. The project of new high-speed line called [[LGV Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur|LGV PACA]] in 2030 could permit to increase trains on tracks with a new crossing of Marseille with a tunnel. Two new stations will be created in the territory of the city and a new line between Cannes and [[Nice Côte d'Azur Airport]].

Services operated by CP:
* [[Nice CP station|Nice CP]] to [[Colomars]] and Plan du Var

==Environment==
The mining company Alteo processes [[bauxite]] to produce aluminium, resulting in various waste materials such as "boues rouges" (red mud) and [[arsenic]]. The dumping of this waste in the marine reserve of [[Calanques National Park]] for six years was authorised by the French Government in 2015. Company representatives have dismissed environmental concerns as exaggerated and uninformed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/pollution/article/2015/12/29/le-prefet-autorise-le-rejet-des-boues-rouges-dans-le-parc-national-des-calanques_4839315_1652666.html|title=Le rejet de produits toxiques autorisé dans le Parc national des Calanques| newspaper=Le Monde.fr |date=December 29, 2015|via=Le Monde}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2015/12/30/01016-20151230ARTFIG00195-querelle-gouvernementale-sur-les-boues-rouges.php|title=Querelle entre Royal et Valls sur le rejet des boues rouges dans les Calanques|website=LEFIGARO| date=30 December 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://alteo-environnement-gardanne.fr/-Arret-des-rejets-de-boues-rouges-61-|title=Arrêt des rejets de " boues rouges " en mer - Alteo Gardanne Environnement|website=alteo-environnement-gardanne.fr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencesetavenir.fr/nature-environnement/pollution/paca-le-prefet-autorise-pour-6-ans-le-rejet-des-boues-rouges-dans-le-parc-national-des-calanques_102464|title=PACA : le préfet autorise pour 6 ans le rejet des boues rouges dans le Parc national des Calanques|website=Sciences et Avenir| date=30 December 2015 }}</ref> The region also includes another national park, [[Port-Cros National Park]] near Toulon.

Due to motor vehicle traffic, the urban areas are often saturated on a daily basis, but cities are investing in public transport networks such as [[Marseille Metro|Marseille's subway]] (2 lines) and [[Marseille tramway|tramway]] (3 lines), the [[Aubagne tramway]] (1 line) and the [[Nice tramway]] (3 lines). Other networks existed at the beginning of the 20th century in smaller cities such as [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[Avignon]], [[La Ciotat]] and [[Toulon]] but are now gone.

==Education==
Major universities of the region include the [[Aix-Marseille University]], the [[University of Toulon]], the [[University of Avignon]] and the [[Côte d'Azur University]]. Other towns have higher education classes but no universities.
