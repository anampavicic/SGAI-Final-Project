'''Sasolburg''' is the third largest city (after Bloemfontein, Welkom) within the [[Metsimaholo Local Municipality]] in the far north of the [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]] province of South Africa and is further sub-divided into three areas: Sasolburg proper, Vaalpark (a more affluent cluster of suburbs located about 5&nbsp;km north of the Sasolburg CBD) and Zamdela (a [[Township (South Africa)|townships]]).

The city is located only 13km south of the province of Gauteng and forms part of the [[Vaal Triangle]] (Vanderbijlpark, Vereeniging, and Sasolburg) regions. It is only an hour's drive from Johannesburg. Most [[White South African|white]] residents of Sasolburg speak [[Afrikaans]] as a first language, while most black people who live in Zamdela speak [[Sesotho]] as a [[first language]]. The [[Sasol]] corporation has sponsored infrastructural developments in Sasolburg, such as an Olympic size swimming pool named after [[Penelope Heyns]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==History==

The town was established in 1954 to provide housing and other facilities for [[Sasol]] employees. The initial installation (Sasol 1) was a pilot plant to refine oil from coal, due to the lack of petroleum reserves. The coal reserves of the country were and still are extensive. The political developments of the late 1960s and early 1970s (specifically the trade embargoes against the [[apartheid]] government) made the operation of the pilot plant a priority to the government. Plans were made for a production plant to be built in the [[Eastern Transvaal]] to produce approximately 25% of the national fuel requirements. The new town of [[Secunda, Mpumalanga|Secunda]] was built to house the construction and operations staff of what became known as SASOL 2 and SASOL 3 ([[Secunda CTL]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Sasol One was one of the first places to be designated as a National Key Point under the [[National Key Points Act, 1980]], which legislation protected areas so designated from "loss, damage, disruption or immobilisation (that) may prejudice the Republic".<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2014-10-22-before-marikana-there-was-the-deadly-sasol-strike/|title=Before Marikana, there was the deadly SASOL strike|last=Moeti|first=Koketso|authorlink=Koketso Moeti|date=22 October 2014|website=The Daily Maverick|access-date=21 May 2017}}</ref>(now Sasolburg has the city called Amelia 

=== Bombing ===
On 2 June 1980, Sasolburg was attacked<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1980/0606/060651.html|title=S.

[[Kader Asmal]], founder of the [[Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement]], claimed in his memoirs, ''Politics in my Blood'', that the ANC had recruited volunteers from the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) to do reconnaissance on the refinery.<ref name=":1" />

The attack proved to be largely ineffectual in terms of sabotaging the manufacturing processes of the Sasol plant. However the propaganda impact of the attack was significant:{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} the South African government presented the event as the result of a foreign, [[Rooi gevaar|communist onslaught]] against South Africa, and not a domestic reaction to the country's racial policies.<ref name=":0" /> Police Minister [[Louis le Grange]] claimed that the then-exiled [[Joe Slovo]], of the banned [[South African Communist Party]], was a key figure. Newspapers that supported the ruling [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] claimed that, in fact, [[Muammar Gaddafi|Muammar Qaddafi]] had masterminded the sabotage, and that Russians had been training terrorists in [[Libya]].<ref name=":0" />

=== October 1987 strike ===
On 1 October 1987, Sasol 1's management called in police and vigilantes to break up a workers’ strike resulting from a wage dispute. Over the following weeks, 77 workers died, and the 2 400 jobs were retrenched without their due compensation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2010-06-18-hopes-pinned-on-peoples-president|title=Hopes pinned on people's president|last=Faull|first=Lionel|date=18 June 2010|work=Mail & Guardian|access-date=21 May 2017}}</ref> The ex-workers took SASOL to court as result and, in 1989, the [[Labour Court of South Africa|Labour Court]] ruled in favour of the ex-workers; however, as of 2014, they have yet to receive compensation. SASOL still denies responsibility and, as a result of the refinery's designation as a National Key Point, the actions taken against workers remain secret until today.<ref name=":2" />

=== Demarcation riots ===
In January 2013, residents of Sasolburg's Zamdela township rioted in response to a demarcation proposal to incorporate Sasolburg into the neighbouring [[Parys]]'s [[Ngwathe Local Municipality|Ngwathe municipality]], believing that the merge would result in poorer service delivery and increased corruption.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2013-01-23-political-bullying-the-new-south-african-way/|title=Political bullying: The new South African way|last=Munusamy|first=Ranjeni|date=23 January 2013|website=The Daily Maverick|access-date=21 May 2017}}</ref> Police were unable to stop the violence, which involved assault, vandalism, and plundering, as they were outnumbered.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/thetimes/2013/01/22/Give-us-what-we-want-or-else|title=Give us what we want – or else|last=Hosken|first=Graeme|date=22 January 2013|website=Times LIVE|access-date=21 May 2017}}</ref>

==Geography==

Sasolburg is at a high altitude with a fairly dry climate and large seasonal temperature variation. It is situated on the banks of the [[Vaal River]], which separates the Free State from the former [[Transvaal Province]], and is not far from the [[Vaal Dam]] where excellent [[windsurfing]] spots can be found.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Government==

Sasolburg is the seat of both the [[Fezile Dabi District Municipality]] and the [[Metsimaholo Local Municipality]] of the northern [[Free State (province)|Free State]].
