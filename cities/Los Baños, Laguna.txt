'''Los Baños''' (IPA: [[Help:IPA/Tagalog|[lɔs bɐˈɲɔs]]]), officially the '''Municipality of Los Baños''' ({{lang-tgl|Bayan ng Los Baños}}), colloquialy 'elbi' or simply LB, is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 115,353 people.{{PH census|current}}

It has a total land area of {{convert|56.5|sqkm|sp=us}} and is bordered on the south and south-west by [[Mount Makiling]] and [[Santo Tomas, Batangas|Santo Tomas]] in [[Batangas]], on the north by [[Laguna de Bay]], on the north-west by [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]] and on the east by the town of [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]]. The town is located {{convert|63|km|sp=us}} southeast of [[Manila]] and is easily accessible via the [[South Luzon Expressway]] along with Manila South Road and [[Calamba–Pagsanjan Road]].

The municipality lies on the northern slopes of the long dormant volcano [[Mount Makiling]] and is known among tourists for its hot spring resorts. Los Baños also hosts two constituent universities of the [[University of the Philippines|University of the Philippines System]]: the [[University of the Philippines Los Baños]] and [[University of the Philippines Open University]], along with other foreign and local and international research centers, such as the [[International Rice Research Institute]], the [[ASEAN]] Center for Biodiversity, the [[Philippine Rice Research Institute]], [[Philippine Carabao Center]], and the [[Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization]]-[[Southeast Asian Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture]](SEAMEO-SEARCA) at UPLB making the town a temporary home for tens of thousands of both local and foreign undergraduate and graduate students, researchers and support staff.

Los Baños was declared as the ''Special Science and Nature City of the Philippines'' through Presidential Proclamation No. 349.<ref name="pp349">{{cite PH act|chamber=PP|number=349|title=Designating and Declaring the Municipality of Los Baños, Laguna as a Special Science and Nature City of the Philippines|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2000/08/07/proclamation-order-no-349-s-2000/|folio=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines]]|access-date=May 26, 2017|date={{date|7 Aug 2000}}}}</ref> The proclamation, however, does not convert the municipality to a city or give it corporate powers that are accorded to other cities.

Aside from its importance in academics, science and research, Los Baños is a well-known tourist destination. Because of the town's proximity to [[Metro Manila]], Los Baños's [[hot spring]] resorts are frequent weekend or summer getaways for residents of the vast metropolis and tourists from other places in the Philippines and abroad. Tourists who visit Los Baños also come to the several native delicacies stores in the town to buy the town's famous ''[[buko pie]]'' (coconut meat pie) as well as a home-grown brand of chocolate cake.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/851347/in-los-banos-giant-buko-pie-steals-christmas-show|title=In Los Baños, giant 'buko' pie steals Christmas show|last=Cinco|first=Maricar|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|language=en|access-date=April 21, 2020}}</ref><ref name=mernels-abscbn>{{cite news |work=ABS-CBN News|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/business/12/14/13/meet-couple-behind-lagunas-famous-cakes |title=Meet the couple behind Laguna's 'famous cakes' |publisher=ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=November 3, 2016}}</ref> Currently, it is Laguna's richest municipality in terms of assets amounting to {{Philippine peso|652.95 million|link=yes}} as of 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.coa.gov.ph/phocadownload/userupload/Annual-Financial-Report/lgu/2016/2016_AFR_LGUs_Volume_I.pdf|title=2016 Annual Financial Report – Local Government|volume=1|date=September 25, 2017|publisher=Republic of the Philippines – Commission on Audit|access-date=September 10, 2018}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Los Baños is derived from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "the [[Public bathing|baths]]", also referring to the hot springs. It was named as such in 1589 when Fr. Pedro Bautista built public baths in the present-day town.<ref name="losbanosweb.com">{{cite web|url=https://losbanos.gov.ph/abouts|title=HISTORY|website=Municipality of Los Baños|accessdate=August 1, 2023}}</ref>

==History==
===Spanish colonial era===
Los Baños started as a settlement, a barrio of [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]] called ''Mainit'', the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] term for "hot", alluding to the thermal springs at the foot of [[Mount Makiling]]. By 1589, through a Franciscan friar, it became popularly called by its present name, ''Los Baños''.

In 1595, a temporary building made of bamboo and [[Imperata cylindrica|cogon]] was built to serve as shelter for the patients who journeyed to Mainit to seek cures for their ailments. It was on September 17, 1615, when the friars administered Los Baños as a separate town from Bay.<ref name="losbanosweb.com"/>

In 1671, more permanent structures like churches and hospitals were built only to be destroyed by a fire in 1727. The structures were re-erected at a slow rate. The church which now stands in the municipal center of Los Baños dates back to 1851. The Spanish Governor's palace was built in 1879 but was only completed in 1892.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D2rzxiXTG7AC|title=A Guide to Los Baños for IRRI International Staff & Families|last=Kirk|first=Kate|publisher=Int.

In 1909, the University of the Philippines College of Agriculture (UPCA) was established.

The UPCA became a Japanese prisoner of war camp for nationals of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied countries]], a target of Kempetai punitive measures, and the headquarters of a secret organization of guerrillas. On February 23, 1945, US forces of the First Battalion, 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the Eleventh Airborne Division led a combined [[Raid at Los Baños|amphibious and airborne raid]] against the prison camp, rescuing over 2,000 Allied nationals. They killed the 250-man Japanese garrison. In order to force the prisoners to leave behind their belongings and speed up the evacuation before the Japanese could send reinforcements, US forces and Filipino guerrillas burned the camp. Only [[Baker Memorial Hall|Baker Hall]], the university gymnasium until 2010, remained intact.<ref>{{cite book | first=Bruce | last=Henderson | title=Rescue at Los Baños: The Most Darking Prison Camp Raid of World War II | year=2015}}</ref> [[Tomoyuki Yamashita|General Yamashita]], the most famous World War 2 General of the Japanese, was tried and executed for [[war crimes]] in Los Baños, Laguna.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yamashita Hanged|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/maltribune19460223-1.2.12|work=Malaya Tribune|date=February 23, 1946}}</ref>

===Philippine independence===
In 1959, the [[10th World Scout Jamboree]] was held in Los Baños, with the theme "Building Tomorrow Today" with an attendance of 12,203 Scouts.

The [[International Rice Research Institute]] (IRRI) was established in 1960 during the administration of President [[Carlos P. Garcia]],<ref name="BillGanzel">{{Cite web |url=http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe50s/crops_17.html |title=The Development of "Miracle Rice" Varieties |last=Ganzel |first=Bill |date=2007 |website=Wessels Living History Farm |publisher=Ganzel Group |access-date=September 19, 2017 |archive-date=June 5, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170605030808/http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe50s/crops_17.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> and soon after President [[Diosdado Macapagal]] had started his term, IRRI had begun work on the development of the new [[IR8|“Miracle Rice” (IR8)]] variety, which would later increase Philippine rice production significantly.<ref name="BillGanzel"/>

When martial law was declared in September 1972, Marcos cracked down on any form of criticism or activism, leading to the arrest of many of Los Baños residents. Among those who experienced arrest and torture during martial law were the UPLB Institute of Chemistry's Dr. [[Aloysious Baes]], while among those who became desaparecidos were [[Tish Ladlad]], [[Cristina Catalla]], [[Gerry Faustino|Gerardo "Gerry" Faustino]], [[Rizalina Ilagan]], and UPLB Professor [[Jessica Sales]]. Among those confirmed to have been martyred for their beliefs was [[Manuel Bautista]], the student leader who had spearheaded the establishment of UPLB's Textbook Exchange and Rental Center (TERC).<ref name="PangilinanJamolinDeGuzmanandYema2020"/><ref name="MalayRodriguez">{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/927728036 |title=Ang mamatay nang dahil sa 'yo |last=Malay, Carolina S., 1940- |year=2015 |isbn=978-971-538-270-0 |location=Ermita, Manila, Philippines |oclc=927728036}}</ref>

In 1979, the evolution and development of academic excellence in Los Baños moved the people of Los Baños to request president Marcos to declare the municipality as "A Special University Zone", granted on June 15, 1982, by virtue of letter of instruction No. 883.

Los Baños was further declared as an "Agriculture, Forestry, and Life Sciences Community" on March 17, 1982, by virtue of Executive Order No. 784 (Section 23).<ref>{{cite PH act |title=Reorganizing the National Science Development Board and Its Agencies Into a National Science and Technology Authority and for Related Purposes |chamber=EO |number=784, s. 1982 |date=March 17, 1982 |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1982/03/17/executive-order-no-784-s-1982/ |accessdate=August 1, 2023}}</ref>

====Post-EDSA revolution era====
[[File:Science and Nature City, Los Baños, Laguna.jpg|thumb|Special Science and Nature City Marker]]
On August 7, 2000, Los Baños was declared a ''Special Science and Nature City of the Philippines'' by virtue of Presidential Proclamation No. 349. It was signed by then-President [[Joseph Estrada]].<ref name="pp349" /> The Proclamation is in recognition of the town's important contribution in country. The municipality has remained as the country's hub of science and nature with the presence of national and international research institutions collaborating towards the advancement of science research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.losbanos.gov.ph/history/page/3|title=The Special Science and Nature City|publisher=Municipality of Los Baños|access-date=August 17, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229164954/http://losbanos.gov.ph/history/page/3|archive-date=December 29, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===21st century===
The 6th Flora Malesiana, a triennial gathering of people with botanical expertise regarding "[[Malesia]]", was held from September 20 to 24, 2004. It provided a forum for Flora Malesiana members and encouraged publications on Malesian plants.

During the [[2005 Southeast Asian Games]], Los Baños played host to the aquatics events, with the newly built Trace Aquatic Center at [http://tracecollege.edu.ph/ Trace College] serving as the venue.

The headquarters of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) Center for Biodiversity was opened on August 8, 2006, having leased office spaces until late 2010s from the DENR-Ecosystems Research and Development Bureau, located at the College of Forestry, [[University of the Philippines Los Baños]]. It coincided with the foundation day celebrations of the organization. The Philippines assumed the Chairmanship of ASEAN in 2006 and played host to the 12th ASEAN and [[East Asia Summit]]s (held in [[Metro Cebu]], January 2007).

In January 2007, the 5th ASEAN Inter-Club Age-Group Swimming Championships was held in the Trace Aqua Sports Center.

Los Baños also plays host to the [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines|UAAP]], as the Trace Aquatics Center has served as the venue for the league's swimming competitions since [[UAAP Season 70]] until [[UAAP Season 76 swimming championships|UAAP Season 76]].

Currently, Los Baños is probably the densest habitat of academicians in South East Asia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://losbanos.gov.ph/facts-and-figures|title=FACTS & FIGURES: Municipality of Los Banos|website=losbanos.gov.ph|access-date=November 20, 2019|archive-date=December 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191206071345/http://www.losbanos.gov.ph/facts-and-figures|url-status=dead}}</ref> Although it is a small town, it has contributed widely through scientific achievements and contributions locally and worldwide particularly on agriculture.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Geography==
[[File:SantoTomasBatangasjf0829 01.JPG|thumb|Mount Makiling, previously declared as the first national park of the Philippines is now administered by the University of the Philippines Los Baños]]
Los Baños is nestled between two of Southern Luzon's most dominant geographical features – [[Mount Makiling]] to the south and south-west and [[Laguna de Bay]] to the north.<ref name="roadplan">{{cite map |publisher = Los Baños Municipal Planning and Development Office |title = Plan of Road Network for Municipality of Los Baños, Province of Laguna, Island of Luzon }}</ref> In fact, Laguna de Bay's southernmost tip is at Barangay Bambang, and Barangay Bagong Silang is already halfway up Mount Makiling. Both the mountain and the lake are volcanic features – Makiling being a potentially active volcano whose geothermal activities gave birth to the hot springs after which the town was named, and Laguna de Bay being the filled-in caldera of a massive prehistoric volcano.

Another notable geological feature is [[Tadlac Lake]], a [[maar]] lake whose almost perfectly round shape and uncharted waters have led some locals to call it "the enchanted lake". Others call it "alligator lake", a reminder that it served as the last bastion of Laguna de Bay's once-plentiful cayman population, which has since been wiped out and is now just another legendary part of Philippine history.

===Rivers===
The town of Los Baños is crossed by five rivers or creeks:<ref name="roadplan"/>
