'''Tangshan''' ({{zh|c=唐山 |p=Tángshān}}) is a coastal, industrial [[prefecture-level city]] in the northeast of [[Hebei]] province. It is located in the eastern part of Hebei Province and the northeastern part of the North China Plain. It is located in the central area of the [[Bohai Economic Rim|Bohai Rim]] and serves as the main traffic corridor to the [[Northeast China|Northeast]]. The city faces the [[Bohai Sea]] in the south, the [[Yan Mountains]] in the north, [[Qinhuangdao]] across the [[Luan River]] to the east, and [[Tianjin]] to the west.

Much of the city's development is thanks to the industrialization, beginning in 1870, when [[Kailuan Group]] established coal mines in the region. It's the birthplace of China's first [[standard-gauge railway]],<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal |script-title=zh:唐胥铁路史实考辨 |author=Xiangming Pan |journal=Jianghai Academic Journal |issue=4 |year=2009 |page=185～191}}</ref> the first railway plant,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tangshan.gov.cn/zhuzhan/tsgl/20180522/594968.html |script-title=zh:工业概况-中国唐山 |access-date=2018-08-28 |work=www.tangshan.gov.cn |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180828134434/http://www.tangshan.gov.cn/zhuzhan/tsgl/20180522/594968.html |archive-date=2018-08-28 |url-status=dead}}</ref> the first [[steam locomotive]],<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |url=http://www.kailuanpark.com/content.aspx?id=252&yj=7 |script-title=zh:开滦国家矿山公园 |access-date=2018-08-27 |work=www.kailuanpark.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180827142245/http://www.kailuanpark.com/content.aspx?id=252&yj=7 |archive-date=2018-08-27 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and the first cement factory.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web |url=http://www.kailuanpark.com/content.aspx?id=430&yj=7 |script-title=zh:开平矿务局创办中国第一家水泥厂 |access-date=2018-09-19 |author=Lei Yang |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919132731/http://www.kailuanpark.com/content.aspx?id=430&yj=7 |archive-date=2018-09-19 |url-status=dead}}</ref> It was hailed as China's "cradle of industrialization".

The city of Tangshan is approximately {{cvt|149|km}} east by south east of Beijing and {{cvt|110|km}} northwest of [[Tianjin]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The guide to port entry |date=1 January 2017 |publisher=IHS Fairplay guides |location=London |edition=21}}</ref> Tangshan's prefecture population was 7,717,983 at the 2020 census, with 3,687,607 in the built-up (''or metro'') area made of the 7 urban core districts.

==Etymology==
Tangshan is named after [[Dacheng Hill]] ({{lang|zh|大城山}}), which was called Mount Tang (唐山), in the middle of the city.

In A.D. 645, [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Li Shimin]], an [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|emperor of Tang dynasty]] and his army were stationed at Dacheng Hill on his way back from the [[Korean Peninsula]]. Unfortunately, Caofei, his beloved concubine, died there. In order to commemorate her, he named the mountain with the name of the empire — Tang. Later, the city took the name of the mountain.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

==History==

===Early history===
Tangshan has a long history, with ancient humans living in the area as early as 4,000 years ago. It fell within the territory of the [[Guzhu]] Kingdom (1600{{nbsp}}BC) at the time of the [[Shang dynasty]] and later became a part of the [[Yan (state)|State of Yan]], one of the [[seven Warring States]] (403{{snd}}221{{nbsp}}BC). During the [[Han dynasty]] (206{{nbsp}}BC{{snd}}220{{nbsp}}AD) it became part of the ancient province of [[Youzhou]]. It was under the jurisdiction of [[Zhili|Zhili province]] and Zunhua State successively during the [[Qing dynasty]].

===Tang, Ming and Qing dynasties===
Tangshan was a village at the time of the [[Tang dynasty]] (619{{ndash}}907) and developed further in agriculture, oil exploitation and ceramics during the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368{{ndash}}1644).

During the Hundred Days' Reform in the late Qing dynasty, the Kaiping Mining Administration was established in the third year of the [[Guangxu Emperor]] (1877). In 1878, Qiaotun town was established at Tangshan and renamed Tangshan Town in 1889. In 1938, Tangshan City was formally founded. The administrative system of Tangshan during the Republic of China [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republican era]] continued to follow the Qing system. In 1929, [[Zhili Province]] changed its name to [[Hebei Province]]. On January{{nbsp}}28, 1939, because of Tangshan's special economic and political position, the [[East Hebei Autonomous Government]] established Tangshan City which was initially called “Tangshan Municipal Government” and later changed to “Tangshan Municipal Office”. After Japan surrendered in 1945, the Chinese Nationalist Party in Peking (now known as [[Beijing]]) took over the political control of Tangshan from Japan and set up an Administration Inspectors Office. In April 1946, it was decided at the 132nd Meeting of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] Hebei Provincial Committee to set up Tangshan City and on May{{nbsp}}5 of the same year, the Tangshan Municipal government was founded.

===People's Republic===
After the establishment of the People's Republic of China on October{{nbsp}}1, 1949, Tangshan remained a provincially administered municipality with 12 areas under its jurisdiction.
In March 1955, it was decided at the 2nd session of the first People's Congress of Tangshan City to change Tangshan Municipal people's government to Tangshan people's committee without changing its administration areas.

On April{{nbsp}}28, 1958, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] approved the establishment of Tangshan prefecture. On August{{nbsp}}29, 1958, it was decided at the Seventh Session of the first People's Congress of Hebei Province to move the Tangshan Commissioner Office from Changli County to Tangshan City.

The CPC Central Committee decided to designate Tangshan city as one of the 45 cities open to the world on June{{nbsp}}3, 1959. On June 8, 1959, the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee and the Hebei Provincial People's Congress decided to combine the Tangshan Commissioners Office and the Tangshan People's Committee into the Tangshan People's Committee. On April{{nbsp}}2, 1960, the State Council officially approved the abolition of Tangshan prefecture. Qinhuangdao city, Qian'an, Changli, Laoting, Baodi, Yutian, Jixian County and Zunhua which were formerly administered by Tangshan Prefecture were incorporated into the Tangshan Municipality. Luanxian County, Fengrun County (formerly a district) and Baigezhuang Farm were also incorporated into Tangshan Municipality. Meanwhile, Tangshan became a provincially administered municipality.

On May{{nbsp}}23, 1961, the State Council approved the reinstatement of Tangshan prefecture, which was adopted at the 14th Meeting of the Hebei Provincial People's Committee on June{{nbsp}}3, 1959. Tangshan prefecture and Tangshan municipality were separated again and Tangshan turned into a specially administered municipality.

The Tangshan Municipal Revolutionary Committee affiliated to the Revolutionary Committee of Tangshan Region was set up on January{{nbsp}}6, 1968. On March 11, 1978, Tangshan turned to be a provincially administered municipality.

In October 1982, it was decided at the Seventh People's Congress of Tangshan city to abolish the Tangshan Municipal Revolutionary Committee and set up the Tangshan Municipal People's Government.

The State Council approved the move on March 3, 1983, and thereafter implemented the city-governing-county system. On May{{nbsp}}13, 1983, the Hebei Provincial People's Government announced the cancellation of the Civic Administration office of Tangshan region, which ceased operation on May{{nbsp}}15, 1983.

On December{{nbsp}}15, 1984, the State Council approved Tangshan city as one of 13 national “comparatively big” cities.

===1976 Tangshan earthquake===
{{Main|1976 Tangshan earthquake}}
Tangshan suffered an [[1976 Tangshan earthquake|earthquake]] of [[moment magnitude scale|magnitude]] 7.8 (7.5 according to official reports) at 3:42{{nbsp}}am on July{{nbsp}}28, 1976, which resulted in many casualties. The official death toll was 255,000, but many experts believe that the actual number of fatalities was two to three times that number, making it the most destructive earthquake in modern history. As a result of the earthquake, most of the town had to be rebuilt. The earthquake was depicted in the 2010 movie ''[[Aftershock (2010 film)|Aftershock]]''.

==Geography==
Tangshan is located in the central section of the [[Bohai Economic Rim]], facing the [[Bohai Sea]] to the south. Lying on the [[North China Plain]], Tangshan is adjacent to the [[Yan Mountains]] to the north, borders the [[Luan River]] and [[Qinhuangdao]] to the east, and to the west and southwest borders [[Tianjin]]. Because of its location in the northeast of Hebei, it is a strategic area and a corridor linking two China's [[North China|north]] and [[Northeast China|northeast]] regions. The largest river in the prefecture is the Luan River.

===Climate===
Tangshan has a [[monsoon]]-influenced, [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dwa''), with cold and very dry winters, and hot, rainy summers. Spring and autumn are short with some rainfall. The monthly 24-hour average temperature in January is {{cvt|−3.6|°C|1}}, and {{cvt|26.9|°C|1}} in July, and the annual mean is {{cvt|12.8|°C|1}}. Close to 60% of the annual precipitation of {{cvt|590|mm|1|sp=us}} falls in July and August alone. The frost-free period lasts 180−190 days, and the area receives 2,600−2,900 hours of sunshine annually.
