'''Solingen''' ({{IPA|de|ˈzoːlɪŋən|-|De-Solingen.ogg}}; {{langx|li|Solich}}) is a city in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Germany, 25&nbsp;km east of [[Düsseldorf]] along the northern edge of the [[Bergisches Land]], south of the [[Ruhr]]. After [[Wuppertal]], it is the second-largest city in the Bergisches Land, and a member of the regional authority of the [[Rhineland]].

Solingen is called the "City of Blades", and has long been renowned for the manufacturing of fine swords, knives, scissors and razors made by firms such as [[WKC Stahl- und Metallwarenfabrik|WKC]], DOVO, [[Wüsthof]], [[Zwilling J. A. Henckels]], [[Böker]], Güde, Hubertus, Diefenthal, Puma, Clauberg/Klauberg, Eickhorn, Linder, Carl Schmidt Sohn, Dreiturm, Herder, Martor Safety Knives, Wolfertz and numerous other manufacturers.

The medieval [[swordsmith]]s of Solingen designed the town's [[coat of arms]]. In the late 17th century, a group of swordsmiths from Solingen broke their guild oaths by taking their sword-making secrets with them to [[Shotley Bridge]], County Durham, in England.

Solingen lies southwest of [[Wuppertal]] in the [[Bergisches Land]]. The city has an area of {{convert|89.45|km2|sqmi}}, of which roughly 50% is used for agriculture, horticulture, or forestry. The city's border is {{convert|62|km|mi}} long, and the city's dimensions are {{convert|15.6|km|mi}} east to west and {{convert|11.7|km|mi}} north to south. The [[Wupper|Wupper river]], a right tributary of the [[Rhine]], flows through the city for {{convert|26|km|mi}}. The city's highest point at 276 metres (906&nbsp;ft) is in the northern borough of [[Gräfrath]] at the Light Tower, previously the [[water tower]], and the lowest point at 53 metres (174&nbsp;ft) is in the southwest.

==History==
===Middle Ages===
Solingen was first mentioned in 1067 by a chronicler who called the area "Solonchon". Early variations of the name included "Solengen", "Solungen", and "Soleggen", although the modern name seems to have been in use since the late 14th and early 15th centuries.

Blacksmiths' smelters, dating back over 2000 years, have been found around the town, adding to Solingen's fame as a Northern Europe blacksmith centre. Swords from Solingen have turned up in places such as the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in the British Isles. Northern Europe prized the quality of Solingen's manufactured weaponry, and they were traded across the European continent. Solingen today remains the knife-centre of Germany.

It was a tiny village for centuries, but became a fortified town in the 15th century.

===Thirty Years' War===
After being ravaged by the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] with about 1,800 deaths in 1614–1619, Solingen was heavily fought over during the [[Thirty Years' War]], repeatedly attacked and plundered, and the Burg Castle was destroyed.

===Modern Age===
[[File:SOL001.JPG|thumb|150px|Coins issued in 1919 by the City of Solingen]]
[[File:Stadt Solingen 1922.jpg|thumb|150px|Bond of the City of Solingen, issued 1 July 1922]]
Early in the 20th century, Ohligs's chief manufactures were [[cutlery]] and [[household hardware|hardware]], and there were iron-foundries and [[flour mill]]s. Other industries were brewing, dyeing, weaving and brick-making.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Ohligs|volume=20|page=34 }}</ref>
In 1929, Ohligs located in the [[Prussia]]n [[Rhine Province]], {{convert|17|mi|km}} by rail north of [[Cologne]] became part of Solingen.

In [[World War II]], the Old Town was completely destroyed by a [[Strategic bombing during World War II|bombing raid]] by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in 1944; 1,800 people died and over 1,500 people were injured.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://solinger-bote.de/nachrichten/2014/11/05/solingen-gedenken-an-solinger-bombenopfer-vor-70-jahren/ |title=Solingen: Gedenken an Solinger-Bombenopfer vor 70 Jahren &#124; |access-date=6 November 2014 |archive-date=6 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106165734/http://solinger-bote.de/nachrichten/2014/11/05/solingen-gedenken-an-solinger-bombenopfer-vor-70-jahren/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> As such, there are few pre-war sites in the centre.

From 1945 to 1949 Solingen was part of the British occupation zone. Reconstruction of the old town began in 1949. The newly built Protestant church in Fronhof was consecrated in 1954, and the destroyed towers of the Catholic church of St. Clemens were rebuilt in a different style. By the end of the 1970s, the city's population had increased due to numerous new housing developments in all parts of the city. The city's infrastructure continued to grow, with the opening of the theatre and concert hall in 1963 and the construction of the Viehbachtalstraße motorway through the city in the late 1970s. In 1975, the city grew again with the incorporation of the previously independent town of Burg an der Wupper. In 1993, Solingen made international headlines for a [[1993 Solingen arson attack|right-wing extremist arson attack]] in which five Turkish girls and women were killed. The attack was followed by demonstrations and riots in the city.

Since the beginning of the new millennium, the ''Klingenstadt'' has undergone a massive transformation as a result of urban development projects such as Regionale 2006 and City 2013. For example, the new Korkenzieherstrasse cycle path was created and the demolition of the Turmhotel and the former Karstadt Passage made it possible to build a new shopping centre on Neumarkt in Solingen-Mitte. After the closure of the old central station in Solingen-Mitte, Ohligs station was officially named the new Solingen central station by [[Deutsche Bahn AG]] on 10 December 2006.

On 23 August 2024, a [[2024 Solingen stabbing|mass stabbing]] occurred during a festival for the city's 650th founding anniversary.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |date=23 August 2024 |title=Messer-Amok in Solingen: Mindestens drei Menschen bei Stadtfest getötet |url=https://www.bild.de/news/inland/messer-amok-in-solingen-mehrere-menschen-bei-stadtfest-getoetet-641fe8c9d020c344f0b8ee09 |access-date=23 August 2024 |website=bild.de |language=de }}</ref>

==Population==
Solingen's population doubled between the years 1880 and 1890 due to the incorporation of the town of Dorp into Solingen in 1889, at which time the population reached 36,000. The population again received a large boost on 1 August 1929 through the incorporation of Ohligs, Wald, Höhscheid, and Gräfrath into the city limits. This brought the population above the 100,000 mark, which gave Solingen the distinction of being a "large city" (''Großstadt''). The number of inhabitants peaked in 1971 with 177,899 residents, and the 2006 population figure was 163,263.

The following chart shows the population figures within Solingen's city limits at the respective points in time. The figures are derived from census estimates or numbers provided by statistical offices or city agencies, with the exception of figures preceding 1843, which were gathered using inconsistent recording techniques.

==Politics==
===Mayor===
The people of Solingen have been able to elect a council and a mayor since 1374, the year the town was granted its charter. The mayor changed annually on 24 June. Solingen has had a mayor since 1896. During the [[Nazi era]] (1933–1945), the mayor was appointed by the [[NSDAP]] and not democratically elected by the people of Solingen.

After the Second World War, the military government of the British occupation zone appointed a [[Lord Mayor]]. From 1946, the Solingen City Council elected an honorary Lord Mayor and a full-time Lord Mayor from among its members. Until 1997, the honorary lord mayors had mainly representative functions, while the full-time lord mayors were the chief administrative officers of the city of Solingen. In 1997, the dual leadership of the city administration was abolished. Since then there has been only one full-time Lord Mayor. He is the chairman of the council, the head of the city administration and the first representative of the city. Since 1999, the Lord Mayor has been directly elected by the electorate in a secret ballot.

The current mayor of Solingen is Tim Kurzbach of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD), elected in 2015 and re-elected in 2020. The most recent mayoral election was held on 13 September 2020, and the results were as follows:

===Trolleybus===
{{main|Trolleybuses in Solingen}}
Solingen has a [[trolleybus]] network, one of only three in Germany remaining besides [[Trolleybuses in Eberswalde|Eberswalde]] and [[Trolleybuses in Esslingen am Neckar|Esslingen am Neckar]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Wuppertal Schwebebahn Album |author=Groneck, Christoph |author2=Lohkemper, Paul |year=2007 |publisher=Robert Schwandl |location=Berlin |pages=58–61 }}</ref>

===Air transport===
The nearest airports are [[Düsseldorf Airport]] and [[Cologne Bonn Airport]]. Both airports can be reached by train from Solingen-Hauptbahnhof (change trains at [[Köln Messe/Deutz station]] for the S-Bahn 13 to Cologne Bonn Airport). Other easily reached airports are [[Frankfurt Airport]] ([[Frankfurt Airport long-distance station|ICE train stop]]), [[Dortmund Airport]] (railway station "[[Holzwickede station|Holzwickede]]" on the RE7 trainline) and the low cost [[Weeze Airport]] (coaches from Düsseldorf Hauptbahnhof).

==Religion==
===Christianity===
Solingen has belonged from its beginnings to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cologne]] (''Erzbistum Köln''), and more specifically to the [[Archdeacon]]ry of the [[Probst]] (''provost'') of [[Cunibert|St. Kunibert]], the [[deanery]] of Deutz. Although the [[Protestant Reformation]] gradually made gains in the city, which was under the control of the [[Berg (state)|Counts of Berg]], the population by and large remained Roman Catholic for a while. The Catholic community was newly endowed by the local lord in 1658 and in 1701 received a new church building. In 1827 Solingen became the seat of its own deanery within the newly defined Archdiocese of Cologne, to which the city's current parishes still belong.

As mentioned, the Reformation only gradually gained a foothold in Solingen. A [[reformed church]] affiliated with the Bergisch [[synod]] was established in 1590, and the city's [[parish church]] became reformed in 1649. [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] had been present in Solingen since the beginning of the 17th century, and a Lutheran congregation was founded in 1635. In 1672 a formalized religious agreement was reached between the city's religious groups. The Reformation was also introduced in Gräfrath in 1590, where a church council was apparently established in 1629. The Reformed and Lutheran churches were formed into a [[United and uniting churches|united church community]] in 1838 following the general [[Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church)|merger of Reformed and Lutheran churches]] in [[Prussia]] in 1817.

The [[Protestant]] parishes originally belonged to the district synod of Lennep, today part of the city [[Remscheid]]. A new synod was established in Solingen in 1843, and the city acquired its own [[Superintendent (ecclesiastical)|superintendent]], a form of church administrator. This formed the basis for the present-day Church District of Solingen, a member of the [[Evangelical Church in the Rhineland]]. With the exception of the [[free churches]], most Protestant churches belong to the Church District of Solingen.

Today approximately 34% of Solingen's population belongs to Protestant churches, and roughly 26% belong to Catholic churches. Other church communities in Solingen include [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]], [[Union of Evangelical Free Church Congregations in Germany|Evangelical Free]] (including [[Baptist]] and [[Plymouth Brethren|Brethren]]), [[United Methodist Church|Methodist]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]], [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]], [[The Salvation Army|Salvation Army]], and [[Free church|free]] churches. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and the [[New Apostolic Church]] also have communities in Solingen.
