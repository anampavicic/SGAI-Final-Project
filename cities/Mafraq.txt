'''Mafraq''' ({{langx|ar|المفرق}} ''Al-Mafraq'', local dialects: ''Mafrag'' or ''Mafra''; {{lit|crossroads}}) is the capital city of [[Mafraq Governorate]] in [[Jordan]], located 80&nbsp;km to the north of the national capital, [[Amman]]. It is located at a crossroads, with a road north going to [[Syria]] and another road to the east going to [[Iraq]]. It had 56,340 inhabitants in 2004.

==History==
[[File:20100922 umaljamal09.jpg|thumb|left|The ancient city of [[Umm el-Jimal]]]]

Mafraq was first settled in the 4th century BC. It is located about 17&nbsp;km west of the historic [[Nabataeans|Nabataean]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] town of [[Umm el-Jimal]], which was built in the 1st century.

The city was first named "Fudain",{{when |date=April 2024}} which comes from the word for fortress in [[Arabic]].

In [[Ottoman Syria|Ottoman]] times, there was a pilgrims' inn or [[khan (inn)|''khan'']] there, known as Khan or Qal'at el-Mafraq, which was part of the [[Syrian Hajj route]], used annually by Muslims on their way to [[Medina]] and [[Mecca]].<ref name=Shqour>{{Cite book |last= Al Shqour |first= Reem Samed |title= The Aqaba Khans and the Origin of Khans in Jordan: An Archaeological Approach |year= 2019 |publisher= Gorgias Press |location= Piscataway, NJ |isbn= 978-1-4632-0651-2 |oclc= 1106116517 |chapter= Ch. 6, Late Islamic Khans of Jordan: Ottoman Khans/''Qila' '' |url= https://api.pageplace.de/preview/DT0400.9781463239541_A43599316/preview-9781463239541_A43599316.pdf |access-date= 27 March 2024}}</ref> The city gained more significance after the establishment of the [[Hejaz Railway]] connecting Damascus (and by extension Istanbul) to Medina in 1908. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] renamed the city "Mafraq", which means "crossroads" in Arabic.

Mafraq was the location of a British military base and airport during the British post-[[WWI]] [[League of Nations mandate|Mandate]]. During the [[Second World War]], the city's military base hosted British troops from India, Australia and other British colonies. It later became the base for the [[Arab Legion]] during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. Mafraq is the headquarters of the Third Division of the [[Jordanian Army]]. [[King Hussein Air College]] and an air base of the [[Royal Jordanian Air Force]] are also located in the city.

In 1945, the Municipality of Mafraq was established, with Ali Abdeyyah as its first mayor.

As of 2016, 50% of the population of Mafraq were [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugees]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Increasingly, hungry refugees receive aid not as food, but as cash|url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21707983-increasingly-hungry-refugees-receive-aid-not-food-cash-fat-help|accessdate=4 October 2016|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|date=1 October 2016}}</ref>
