'''Pasir Mas''' (Jawi: ڤاسير مس, [[Kelantan-Patani Malay|Kelantanese]]: ''Pase Mah'') is a town in [[Pasir Mas District]], in north-western [[Kelantan]], [[Malaysia]].

Pasir Mas is Kelantan's second largest city by population (230,424 in 2020 census).<ref>{{cite web |title=Indikator Utama Banci Penduduk dan Perumahan |url=https://tableau.dosm.gov.my/t/mbls/views/1202/AD7?:display_count=n&:embed=y&:isGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&:origin=viz_share_link&:showAppBanner=false&:showVizHome=n |access-date=20 May 2022}}</ref>

==History==
According to legend, this area which is now known as Pasir Mas was first opened up by Che Leh Ismail who was also known as Che Leh Tok Pendekar. Che Leh Ismail was forced to move to Pasir Mas from Kota Bharu when his land was taken over by the [[Sultan of Kelantan|Sultan]] to build his palace.

During that time, a religious teacher from [[Bachok]] came to teach the [[Quran]] to the villagers in Pasir Mas. The religious teacher returned to Bachok after his teachings were completed. However, a few days after the religious teacher returned to Bachok, three pots of gold suddenly appeared in some bushes. The pots of gold then rolled into a pond at the fringe of the bushes. The villagers who witnessed this happening shouted ''"Mas! Mas!"'' (Malay for [[gold]]) Hence the place was subsequently called Pasir Mas. The word Pasir originated because there was a large field of sand at the bank of the Kelantan River, which was situated near Pasir Mas.<ref>Sejarah Malaysia : [http://sejarahmalaysia.pnm.my/portalBI/detail.php?section=sm03&spesifik_id=149&ttl_id=42 Origins of Place Names : Pasir Mas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405215918/http://sejarahmalaysia.pnm.my/portalBI/detail.php?ttl_id=42&spesifik_id=149&section=sm03 |date=2008-04-05 }}</ref>

==Development==
Haphazard development over the past decades has resulted in the mushrooming of residential houses that encircle the town. This makes potential land acquisition for commercial development a complex and costly exercise. A new township is slowly taking shape about four miles away at the ''[[Mukim]]'' of [[Lubuk Jong]] - a previously swampy area along the road leading to [[Rantau Panjang]].<ref>Pasir Mas District Council : [http://www.mdpm.kelantan.gov.my/mdpm01.html Background (Malay language)]</ref>
