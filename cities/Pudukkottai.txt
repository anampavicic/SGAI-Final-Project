==History==
[[File:AugustusCoinPudukottaiHoardIndia.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Coin of the Roman emperor [[Augustus]] from the Pudukottai hoard ([[British Museum]]).]]

The [[Pudukkottai State|princely state of Pudukottai]] was created by [[Raghunatha Kilavan|Ragunatha Kilavan Sethupati]] of [[Ramnad]] (1673–1708 A.D.) married Kathali Nachiar, the sister of [[Raghunatha Raya Tondaiman]]. He appointed his brother-in-law, Ragunatha Thondaiman, as chief of the district of Pudukottai. Raghunatha Thondaiman earlier had ruled [[Thirumayam]]. In appreciation of Ragunatha Thondaiman's services, Ragunatha Kilavan Setupati gave Pudukkottai as an honor for his services. In later centuries, the Thondaiman rulers, while nominally feudatories of the [[Ramnad]] state, often pursued an independent foreign policy, a trend common in all parts of [[India]] at that time. After the death of Ragunatha Kilavan Setupati Ragunatha Thondaiman become ruler of Pudukottai.<ref>{{cite book|title=Courts of Pre-Colonial South India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gb1vRpDRzBsC&pg=PA115|page=115|last=Howes|first=Jennifer |publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=9781135789961}}</ref>

After becoming the ruler of Pudukottai, Thonddaiman fought against the [[Thanjavur Nayak kingdom|Nayaks of Thanjavur]] in support of the [[Madurai Nayak dynasty|Nayaks of Madurai]] and conquered Thirukkattupalli, a very important place. Then there was a direct clash between the Thondaimans of Pudukottai and the Nayaks, rulers of Tanjore.<ref>{{cite book|title=The New Cambridge History of India|last=Stein|first=Burton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OpxeaYQbGDMC&pg=PA136|pages=136–138|isbn=9780521266932|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref> Thondaiman conquered the west of Thirukkattupalli. The next ruler, Raja Vijaya Reghunatha Raya Thondaiman, helped the Arcot Nawab against [[Hyder Ali]], the ruler of Mysore. He was also loyal to the British Government. After some time, when Hyder Ali's army tried to enter Pudukkottai, Thondaiman's army defeated them and drove Hyder's army away. Thondaiman captured Kilanilai and Aranthangi. He helped the British government against [[Tipu Sultan]].

Pudukkotai finally came under formal British protection. This was arguably unavoidable since the Thondaimans were much menaced in that period by a resurgent Mysore, ruled by Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan. When Tipu Sultan sought to leverage the power of the [[France|French]] against his [[United Kingdom|British]] adversaries, Pudukkotai, in common with its neighbors, such as [[Thanjavur]] and [[Travancore]], found it expedient to ally with the British.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nicholas B.|last=Dirks|title=The Hollow Crown: Ethnohistory of An Indian Kingdom|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1987|isbn=0-521-32604-4|pages=66–67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UP7vmkFSJhIC&pg=PA66}}</ref>

Raja Rajagopala Thondaiman (1928–1948), the last and ninth in the line of Thondaiman rulers, was selected by the British Government and was crowned when he was six years old. After Indian independence in 1947, the Pudukkottai Princely State was amalgamated with the Indian Union on 3 April 1948 and became a division in Tiruchirappalli District. The long history of the Thondaimans' rule came to an end.

Some of the major kings of the dynasty are [[Tondaiman]] (1686–1730), [[Vijaya Raghunatha Raya Tondaiman I|Vijaya Raghunatha Raya Tondaiman]],(1730–1769), [[Raya Raghunatha Tondaiman]] (1769&nbsp;– Dec 1789), [[Vijaya Raghunatha Tondaiman]] (Dec 1789&nbsp;– 1 February 1807), [[Vijaya Raghunatha Raya Tondaiman II|Vijaya Raghunatha Raya Tondaiman]] (1 February 1807&nbsp;– June 1825), [[Raghunatha Tondaiman]] (June 1825&nbsp;– 13 July 1839), [[Ramachandra Tondaiman]] (13 July 1839&nbsp;– 15 April 1886), [[Marthanda Bhairava Tondaiman]] (15 April 1886&nbsp;– 28 May 1928) and [[Rajagopala Tondaiman]] (28 October 1928&nbsp;– 4 March 1948).

Pudukkottai became a [[Princely State of Pudukottai|princely state]] of [[British India]] under the political authority of [[Madras Presidency]]. The state had an area of 4663 Sq.miles and in 1901, a population of 380,000. The Rajas of Pudukkotai were entitled to a 17-gun salute. The last Thondaiman raja of Pudukkottai acceded to newly-[[Independence of India|independent]] India in 1948, and the state became a division of the [[Trichinopoly District]] of [[Madras State]]. The state was reorganized twice in the succeeding decade, taking its present form in 1956; it was renamed Tamil Nadu in 1968. On 14 January 1974, the present [[Pudukkottai District]] was formed from parts of Tiruchirappalli and [[Thanjavur District|Thanjavur]] districts.<ref>{{cite book|title=Formation And Transformation Of Power In Rural India|pages=26–28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jimnj2GjmhcC&pg=PA37|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|year=1996|last=V.|first=Annamalai|isbn=9788171413232}}</ref>
