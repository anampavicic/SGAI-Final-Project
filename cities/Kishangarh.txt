==History==
{{Main|Kishangarh State}}
Kishangarh State was founded by the [[Jodhpur State|Jodhpur]] prince [[Kishan Singh of Kishangarh|Kishan Singh]] in 1609. Before Kishan Singh this area was ruled by Raja [[Samokhan Singh]].<ref>Tareekh-e-Rohela by Nafees Siddiqui</ref>

Kishangarh was the capital of the eponymous [[princely state]] during the [[British Raj]], which was located in the [[Rajputana Agency]]. It had an area of 2210&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (858 miles²) and a population in 1901 of 90,970. This figure for population represented a decrease of 27% over the census figure of 1891, something presumably attributable to the famine of 1899-1900. The state enjoyed an estimated revenue of £34,000 and paid no tribute to the [[British Raj]]. In 1840, Prithvi Singh, became the 15th Maharaja of Kishangarh, and reigned till his death in 1879, after which he was succeeded by his son, Sardul Singh.<ref name=brit>[http://www.collectbritain.co.uk/personalisation/object.cfm?uid=019PHO000000127U00051000 Kishangarh] British Library.</ref>

A municipality was established at Kishangarh in 1892.<ref>{{cite book |author=Rima Hooja |title=A History of Rajasthan |year=2006 |publisher=Rupa |isbn=9788129108906 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tosMAQAAMAAJ |page=1166}}</ref>

Maharaja [[Madan Singh]] ascended the throne in 1900 at the age of sixteen,<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Kishangarh |volume=15 |page=836}}</ref> at a time when the state was reeling from the impact of a devastating drought. The administration under him and his diwan was widely deemed worthy of approbation; irrigation from tanks and wells was extended and factories for ginning and pressing cotton were started.<ref name=EB1911/> A social reform movement for discouraging excessive expenditure on marriages made remarkable impact during his reign.<ref name=EB1911/>
