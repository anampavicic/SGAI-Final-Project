'''Potsdam''' ({{IPA|de|ˈpotsdam|-|De-Potsdam.ogg}}) is the capital and largest city of the [[Germany|German]] [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Brandenburg]]. It is part of the [[Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region]]. Potsdam sits on the [[Havel|River Havel]], a tributary of the [[Elbe]], downstream of Berlin, and lies embedded in a hilly [[morainic]] landscape dotted with many lakes, around 20 of which are located within Potsdam's city limits.  It lies some {{convert|25|km|abbr=off}} southwest of Berlin's city centre. The name of the city and of many of its boroughs are of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] origin.

Potsdam was a residence of the [[Prussia]]n kings and the [[German Emperor]] until 1918. Its planning embodied ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]: through a careful balance of architecture and landscape, Potsdam was intended as "a picturesque, pastoral dream" which would remind its residents of their relationship with nature and reason.<ref>''The Potsdam project, 1996'', HRH The Prince of Wales, Charles; Hanson, Brian; Steil, Lucien; Prince of Wales's Urban Design Task Force; Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture, Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture, 1998, Introduction.</ref>

The city, which is over 1,000 years old, is widely known for its palaces, its lakes, and its overall historical and cultural significance. Landmarks include the parks and palaces of [[Sanssouci]], Germany's largest World Heritage Site, as well as other palaces such as the [[Orangery Palace]], the [[New Palace, Potsdam|New Palace]], [[Cecilienhof Palace]], and [[Charlottenhof Palace]]. Potsdam was also the location of the significant [[Potsdam Conference]] in 1945, the conference where the three heads of government of the USSR, the US, and the UK decided on the division of Germany following its surrender, a conference which defined Germany's history for the following 45 years.

[[Potsdam-Babelsberg|Babelsberg]], in the south-eastern part of Potsdam, was already by the 1930s the home of a major film production studio and it has enjoyed success as an important center of European film production since the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]]. The [[Studio Babelsberg|Filmstudio Babelsberg]], founded in 1912, is the oldest large-scale film studio in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.studiobabelsberg.com/en/corporate/about-us/|title = About us}}</ref>

Potsdam developed into a centre of science in Germany in the 19th century. Today, there are three public colleges, the [[University of Potsdam]], and more than 30 [[research institute]]s in the city.

== Geography ==
[[File:Templiner See, Vorderkappe und Hermannswerder 1.jpeg|thumb|left|The Templiner See south of Potsdam]]
The area was formed from a series of large [[moraine]]s left after the [[last glacial period]]. Today, only one quarter of the city is built up, the rest remaining as green space.

There are about 20 lakes and rivers in and around Potsdam, such as the [[Havel]], the [[Griebnitzsee]], [[Templiner See]], [[Tiefer See]], [[Jungfernsee]], Teltowkanal, [[Heiliger See]], and [[Sacrower See]]. The highest point is the {{convert|114|m|ft|0|adj=on}} high ''[[Kleiner Ravensberg]]''.

===Subdivisions===
Potsdam is divided into seven historic city ''Stadtteile'' (quarters) and nine new ''Ortsteile'' (suburbs/wards, former separate villages), which joined the city in 2003. The appearance of the city boroughs is quite different. Those in the north and in the centre consist mainly of historical buildings, the south of the city is dominated by larger areas of newer buildings.

The city of Potsdam is divided into 32 ''[[Quarter (urban subdivision)|Stadtteile]]'' (boroughs, both quarters and suburbs/wards together),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.potsdam.de/cms/beitrag/10088596/513412/ |title=Stadtteilkatalog der Landeshauptstadt Potsdam |access-date=2016-12-28 |language=de |archive-date=2016-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323080412/http://www.potsdam.de/cms/beitrag/10088596/513412 |url-status=dead }}</ref> which are divided further into 84 statistical ''Bezirke'' (districts).

Today, one distinguishes between the older parts of the city (areas of the historic city and places suburbanized at the latest in 1939) – these are the city center, the western and northern suburbs, Bornim, Bornstedt, Nedlitz, Potsdam South, Babelsberg, Drewitz, Stern and Kirchsteigfeld – and those communities incorporated after 1990 which have since 2003 become ''Ortsteile'' – these are Eiche, Fahrland, Golm, Groß Glienicke, Grube, Marquardt, Neu Fahrland, Satzkorn and Uetz-Paaren.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.potsdam.de/kategorie/stadtteile |title=Stadtteile |publisher=Landeshauptstadt Potsdam |access-date=2016-12-31 |language=de}}</ref> The new ''Ortsteile'' are located mainly in the north of the city. For the history of all incorporations, see the relevant section on incorporation and spin-offs.

At the end of 2019, a change was made to the administrative structure:<ref name="StiB2019" />
* Borough 41 has been renamed: previously ''Nördliche Innenstadt'', now ''Historische Innenstadt''.
* Borough 42 ''(Südliche Innenstadt)'' has been divided into two boroughs, 43 ''(Zentrum Ost und Nuthepark)'' and 44 ''(Hauptbahnhof und Brauhausberg Nord)''. The number 42 was thus repealed.
* Some very sparsely populated urban boroughs have been disbanded:
** Borough 33 ''(Wildpark)'' was incorporated into borough 32 ''(Potsdam-West)''.
** Borough 66 ''(Industriegelände)'' was incorporated into borough 64 (formerly ''Waldstadt I''). The borough was then renamed ''Waldstadt I und Industriegelände''.
** Borough 67 ''(Forst Potsdam Süd)'' was incorporated into borough 61 ''(Templiner Vorstadt)''.

=== Climate ===
Officially the climate is [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] - more degraded by being far from the coast and to the east ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.climate-data.org/europe/germany/brandenburg/potsdam-6406/|title=Potsdam climate: Average Temperature, weather by month, Potsdam weather averages - Climate-Data.org|website=en.climate-data.org|access-date=2019-01-30}}</ref> but using the 1961–1990 normal and the 0&nbsp;°C isotherm the city has a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfb''), which also shows a slight influence of the continent different from the climates predominantly influenced by the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Low averages below freezing for almost all winter causing snows that are frequent and winters are cold, but not as stringent as inland locations or with greater influence from the same. Summer is also relatively warm with temperatures between 23 and 24&nbsp;°C, the heat waves being influenced by the [[Urban heat island|UHI]] of Potsdam.<ref name = NOAA>

==Etymology==
The name "Potsdam" originally seems to have been ''[[#History|Poztupimi]]''. A common theory is that it derives from an old [[West Slavic languages|West Slavonic]] term meaning "beneath the oaks",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.potsdam.de/cms/beitrag/10000936/33981/|title=993 – From Poztupimi to the Royal Seat|date=1 December 2004|work=potsdam.de|access-date=27 April 2011|archive-date=8 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308133733/http://www.potsdam.de/cms/beitrag/10000936/33981/|url-status=dead}}</ref> i.e., the corrupted ''pod dubmi/dubimi'' (''pod'' "beneath", ''dub'' "oak"). However, some question this explanation.<ref name=kopish>August Kopish, "Die Königlichen Schlösser u. Gärten zu Potsdam", Berlin, 1854, p. 18</ref>

==History==
===Pre- and early history===
[[File:Schenkungsurkunde Potsdam 993.jpg|thumb|left|Document from the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 993 mentioning ''Poztupimi'']]
[[File:Potsdam Sanssouci 07-2017 img4.jpg|thumb|[[New Palace, Potsdam|New Palace]] today]]
[[File:Stadtschloss Potsdam Gemälde.jpg|thumb|right|[[City Palace, Potsdam|Stadtschloss Potsdam]] in 1773]]

The area around Potsdam shows signs of occupancy since the [[Bronze Age]] and was part of ''[[Magna Germania]]'' as described by [[Tacitus]]. After the [[Migration Period|great migrations]] of the Germanic peoples, [[Slav]]s moved in and Potsdam was probably founded after the 7th century as a settlement of the [[Hevelli]] tribe centred on a castle. It was first mentioned in a document in 993 as ''Poztupimi'', when [[Emperor Otto III]] gifted the territory to the [[Quedlinburg Abbey]], then led by his aunt [[Matilda, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Matilda]].<ref name=kopish/> By 1317, it was mentioned as a small town. It gained its [[town charter]] in 1345. In 1573, it was still a small [[market town]] of 2,000 inhabitants.

===Early modern era===
Potsdam lost nearly half of its population due to the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648).

A continuous [[Hohenzollern]] possession since 1415, Potsdam became prominent, when it was chosen in 1660 as the hunting residence of [[Friedrich Wilhelm I of Brandenburg|Frederick William I]], [[prince-elector|Elector]] of [[Brandenburg-Prussia|Brandenburg]], the core of the powerful state that later became the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. It also housed [[Prussia]]n [[barracks]].

[[File:Voltaire-Baquoy.gif|thumb|right|[[Voltaire]] at the residence of [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]] in Potsdam. Partial view of an engraving by [[Pierre Charles Baquoy]], after N. A. Monsiau]]

After the [[Edict of Potsdam]] in 1685, Potsdam became a centre of European immigration. Its religious freedom attracted people from [[France]] ([[Huguenot]]s), [[Russia]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Bohemia]]. The edict accelerated population growth and economic recovery.

Later, the city became a full residence of the Prussian royal family. The buildings of the royal residences were built mainly during the reign of [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]]. One of these is the [[Sanssouci|Sanssouci Palace]] (French: "without cares" or "no concern", by [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff]], 1744), famed for its formal gardens and [[Rococo]] interiors. Other royal residences include the [[New Palace (Potsdam)|New Palace]] and the [[Orangery Palace|Orangery]].

In 1815, at the formation of the [[Province of Brandenburg]], Potsdam became the provincial capital until 1918, except for a period between 1827 and 1843 when Berlin was the provincial capital (as it became once again after 1918). The province comprised two governorates named after their capitals Potsdam and [[Frankfurt (Oder)]].

===Governorate of Potsdam===
[[File:Stadt Potsdam 1852.jpg|thumb|right|Bond of Potsdam, issued 22 May 1852]]

Between 1815 and 1945, the city of Potsdam served as capital of the {{ill|Regierungsbezirk of Potsdam|de|Regierungsbezirk Potsdam|}} ({{langx|de|Regierungsbezirk Potsdam}}). The ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' encompassed the former districts of [[Uckermark]], the Mark of Priegnitz, and the greater part of the [[Kurmark|Middle March]]. It was situated between [[Mecklenburg]] and the [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Province of Pomerania]] on the north, and the [[Province of Saxony]] on the south and west (Berlin, with a small surrounding district, was an urban governorate and enclave within the governorate of Potsdam between 1815 and 1822, then it merged as urban district into the governorate only to be disentangled again from Potsdam governorate in 1875, becoming a distinct province-like entity on 1 April 1881). Towards the north west the governorate was bounded by the rivers [[Elbe]] and the Havel, and on the north east by the [[Oder]]. The south eastern boundary was to the neighbouring governorate of Frankfurt (Oder). About 500,000 inhabitants lived in the Potsdam governorate, which covered an area of about {{convert|20700|km2|0|abbr=out}}, divided into thirteen rural [[Kreis in Prussia|districts]], partially named after their capitals:<ref name=Curtis-1839>Thomas Curtis (1839).

The traditional towns in the governorate were small, however, in the course of the industrial labour migration some reached the rank of urban districts. The principal towns were [[Brandenburg an der Havel|Brandenburg upon Havel]], [[Köpenick]], Potsdam, [[Prenzlau]], [[Spandau]] and [[Neuruppin|Ruppin]].<ref name=Curtis-1839/> Until 1875 Berlin also was a town within the governorate. After its disentanglement a number of its suburbs outside Berlin's municipal borders grew to towns, many forming urban ''Bezirke'' within the governorate of Potsdam such as [[Charlottenburg]], [[Lichtenberg (locality)|Lichtenberg]], [[Neukölln (locality)|Rixdorf]] (after 1912 Neukölln), and [[Schöneberg]] (all of which, as well as Köpenick and Spandau, incorporated into [[Greater Berlin]] in 1920). The urban ''Bezirke'' were (years indicating the elevation to rank of urban ''Bezirk''or affiliation with Potsdam governorate, respectively):

===20th century===
[[Berlin]] was the capital of [[Prussia]] and later of the [[German Empire]], but the court remained in Potsdam, where many government officials settled. In 1914, Emperor [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]] signed the Declaration of War in the ''Neues Palais'' (New Palace). The city lost its status as a "second capital" in 1918, when Wilhelm II abdicated and Germany became a [[Weimar Republic|Republic]] at the end of [[World War I]].

{{anchor|Allied air attacks}}After the Nazis [[Machtergreifung|seized power in 1933]], there was a ceremonial handshake between [[President of Germany (1919–1945)|President]] [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and the new [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Adolf Hitler]] on 21 March 1933 in Potsdam's [[Garrison Church (Potsdam)|Garrison Church]] in what became known as the "[[Potsdam Day|Day of Potsdam]]". This symbolised a coalition of the military (''[[Reichswehr]]'') and [[Nazism]]. Potsdam was severely damaged by [[Strategic bombing during World War II|Allied bombing raids]] during [[World War II]].

[[File:L to R, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, President Harry S. Truman, and Soviet leader Josef Stalin in the... - NARA - 198958.jpg|thumb|left|[[Potsdam Conference]] in 1945 with [[Winston Churchill]], [[Harry S. Truman]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]]]

The [[Cecilienhof|Cecilienhof Palace]] was the scene of the [[Potsdam Conference]] from 17 July to 2 August 1945, at which the victorious [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] leaders [[Harry S. Truman]], [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] met to decide the future of Germany and postwar Europe in general. The conference ended with the [[Potsdam Agreement]] and the [[Potsdam Declaration]].

[[File:Glienicker Brücke2.JPG|thumb|The [[Glienicke Bridge]], used for exchanging spies during the Cold War]]
The government of [[East Germany]] (formally known as the [[German Democratic Republic]] (German: ''Deutsche Demokratische Republik'', DDR)) tried to remove symbols of "Prussian [[militarism]]". Many historic buildings, some of them badly damaged in the war, were demolished.

When in 1946 the remainder of the Province of Brandenburg west of the [[Oder-Neiße line]] was constituted as the state of [[Brandenburg]], Potsdam became its capital. In 1952 the GDR disestablished its states and replaced them by smaller new [[Subdivisions of East Germany|East German administrative districts]] known as ''Bezirke''. Potsdam became the capital of the new ''[[Potsdam (Bezirk)|Bezirk Potsdam]]'' until 1990.

Potsdam, south-west of Berlin, lay just outside [[West Berlin]] after the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]]. The walling off of West Berlin not only isolated Potsdam from West Berlin, but also doubled commuting times to [[East Berlin]]. The [[Glienicke Bridge]] across the Havel connected the city to West Berlin and was the scene of some [[Cold War]] exchanges of [[spy|spies]].

After [[German reunification]], Potsdam became the capital of the newly re-established state of [[Brandenburg]]. Since then there have been many ideas and efforts to reconstruct the original appearance of the city, including the [[Stadtschloss, Potsdam|Potsdam City Palace]] and the Garrison Church.

==Governance==
[[File:Potsdam Rathaus 07-2017.jpg|thumb|Potsdamer Stadthaus, the city hall]]

===City government===
Potsdam has had a [[mayor]] (''Bürgermeister'') and [[city council]] since the 15th century. From 1809 the city council was elected, with a mayor (''Oberbürgermeister'') at its head. During [[Nazi Germany]], the mayor was selected by the [[NSDAP]] and the city council was dissolved; it was reconstituted in token form after 1945, but free elections did not take place until after [[reunification]].

Today, the city council is the city's central administrative authority. Local elections took place on 26 October 2003 and again in 2008. Between 1990 and 1999, the Chairman of the City Council was known as the "Town President" but today the post is the "Chairman of the City Council". The mayor is elected directly by the population.

[[File:2018 Potsdam mayoral election (2nd round).svg|thumb|300px|Results of the second round of the 2018 mayoral election.]]
The current mayor is Mike Schubert of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) since 2018. The most recent mayoral election was held on 23 September 2018, with a runoff held on 14 October, and the results were as follows:

[[File:Potsdam Sanssouci 07-2017 img2.jpg|thumb|left|The [[University of Potsdam]]]]

Potsdam is a [[College town|university town]]. The [[University of Potsdam]] was founded in 1991 as a university of the State of Brandenburg. Its predecessor was the ''Akademie für Staats- und Rechtswissenschaften der DDR "[[Walter Ulbricht]]"'', a [[college of education]] founded in 1948 which was one of the GDR's most important colleges. There are about 20,000 students enrolled at the university.

[[File:Einsteinturm 7443.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Einstein Tower]] was built in 1921 to house research on the [[theory of relativity]].]]
In 1991 the ''[[Fachhochschule Potsdam]]'' was founded as the second college. It had 3,518 students as of 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fh-potsdam.de/informieren/profil/zahlenfakten/|title=FH Potsdam in Zahlen und Fakten|website=www.fh-potsdam.de|language=de|access-date=2019-04-27|archive-date=2019-04-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190427200334/https://www.fh-potsdam.de/informieren/profil/zahlenfakten/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[Konrad Wolf Film University of Babelsberg]] (HFF), founded in 1954 in [[Babelsberg]], is the foremost{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} centre of the German film industry since its birth, with over 600 students.

There are also several research foundations, including [[Fraunhofer Institute]]s for Applied Polymer Research and Biomedical Engineering, [[Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics]] (''Albert Einstein Institute''), Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces, and Max Planck Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology, the GFZ – [[German Research Centre for Geosciences]], the Potsdam Astrophysical Institute, the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies, The Leibniz Institute for Agricultural Engineering and Bioeconomy and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, which employs 340 people in researching [[climate change]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iap.fraunhofer.de/en.html|title=Fraunhofer IAP|website=Iap.fraunhofer.de|access-date=October 15, 2024}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ibmt.fhg.de/fhg/ibmt_en/profile/locations/_index_potsdam_golm.jsp |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-06-20 |archive-date=2008-03-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316062349/http://www.ibmt.fhg.de/fhg/ibmt_en/profile/locations/_index_potsdam_golm.jsp |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mpikg.mpg.de/en/|title=Home|website=Mpikg.mpg.de|access-date=October 15, 2024}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/|title=Home|website=Mpimp-golm.mpg.de|access-date=October 15, 2024}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090913060315/http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/portal/] {{dead link|date=October 2024}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aip.de/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-08-19 |archive-date=2012-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204112442/http://www.aip.de/institute/history.html |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rifs-potsdam.de/de|title=Startseite &#124; Forschungsinstitut für Nachhaltigkeit|website=Rifs-potsdam.de|access-date=October 15, 2024}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en|title=Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research|website=Pik-potsdam.de|access-date=October 15, 2024}}</ref>

[[File:Schloss Cecilienhof Panorama.jpg|thumb|[[Cecilienhof|Cecilienhof palace]]]]

Potsdam was historically a centre of European immigration. Its religious tolerance attracted people from France, Russia, the Netherlands and Bohemia. This is still visible in the culture and architecture of the city.

The most popular attraction in Potsdam is [[Sanssouci Park]], {{convert|2|km|0|abbr=on}} west of the city centre. In 1744 [[Frederick II of Prussia|King Frederick the Great]] ordered the construction of a residence here, where he could live ''sans souci'' ("without worries", in the French spoken at the court). The park hosts a [[botanical garden]] ([[Botanical Garden, Potsdam]]) and many buildings:

* The [[Sanssouci|Sanssouci Palace]] (''Schloss Sanssouci''), a relatively modest palace of the Prussian royal (and later German imperial) family
* The [[Orangery Palace]] (''Orangerieschloss''), former palace for foreign royal guests
* The [[New Palace (Potsdam)|New Palace]] (''Neues Palais''), built between 1763 and 1769 to celebrate the end of the [[Seven Years' War]], in which Prussia held off the combined attacks of [[Austria]] and Russia. It is a much larger and grander palace than Sanssouci, having over 200 rooms and 400 statues as decoration. It served as a guest house for numerous royal visitors. Today, it houses parts of [[University of Potsdam]].
* The [[Charlottenhof Palace]] (''Schloss Charlottenhof''), a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] palace by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]] built in 1826
* The [[Roman Baths (Potsdam)|Roman Baths]] (''Römische Bäder''), built by Karl Friedrich Schinkel and [[Friedrich Ludwig Persius]] in 1829–1840. It is a complex of buildings including a tea pavilion, a Renaissance-style villa, and a Roman bathhouse (from which the whole complex takes its name).
* The [[Chinese House (Potsdam)|Chinese Tea House]] (''Chinesisches Teehaus''), an 18th-century pavilion built in a [[China|Chinese]] style, the fashion of the time.

Three gates from the original city wall remain today. The oldest is the Hunters' Gate (''Jägertor''), built in 1733. The [[Nauener Tor]] was built in 1755 and close to the historic Dutch Quarter. The ornate [[Brandenburg Gate (Potsdam)|Brandenburg Gate]] (built in 1770, not to be confused with the [[Brandenburg Gate]] in Berlin) is situated on the Luisenplatz at the western entrance to the old town.

[[File:Nikolaikirche mit Tympanon.jpg|thumb|[[St. Nicholas Church, Potsdam|St. Nicholas' Church]] on the ''[[Old Market Square, Potsdam|Alter Markt]]'']]

The [[Old Market Square, Potsdam|Old Market Square]] (''Alter Markt'') is Potsdam's historical city centre. For three centuries this was the site of the [[Stadtschloss, Potsdam|City Palace]] (''Stadtschloß''), a royal palace built in 1662. Under [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]], the palace became the winter residence of the Prussian kings. The palace was severely damaged by Allied bombing in 1945 and demolished in 1961 by the [[Communist]] authorities. In 2002 the Fortuna Gate (''Fortunaportal'') was rebuilt in its original historic position which was followed by a complete reconstruction of the palace as the [[Landtag of Brandenburg|Brandenburg Landtag]] building inaugurated in 2014. Nearby the square in the Humboldtstraße block, which also was demolished after getting damaged in 1945, reconstructions of several representative residential palaces including Palazzo Pompei and Palazzo Barberini [[Museum Barberini|housing an arts museum]] were completed in 2016–2017 alongside buildings with modernized facades to restore the historical proportions of the block.

The Old Market Square is dominated today by the dome of [[St. Nicholas' Church, Potsdam|St. Nicholas' Church]], built in 1837 in the Neoclassical style. It was the last work of Karl Friedrich Schinkel, who designed the building but did not live to see its completion. It was finished by his disciples [[Friedrich August Stüler]] and Ludwig Persius. The eastern side of the Market Square is dominated by the Old City Hall, built in 1755 by the Dutch architect Jan Bouman (1706–1776). It has a characteristic circular tower, crowned with a gilded [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] bearing the world on his shoulders.

North of the Old Market Square is the oval French Church (''Französische Kirche''), erected in the 1750s by Boumann for the [[Huguenot]] community. To the south lies the [[Museum Barberini]], a copy of the previous building, the Barberini Palace. The museum was funded by the German billionaire [[Hasso Plattner]]. The former [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] building was built by [[Carl von Gontard]] in 1771–1772, inspired by the Renaissance palace [[Palazzo Barberini]] in Rome. The newly built museum was scheduled to open in spring 2017.

The [[Garrison Church (Potsdam)|Garrison Church]] contains a [[Coventry Cross of Nails|Coventry]] chapel, an exhibition about the history of the place and a viewing platform at a height of 57 meters.

Another landmark of Potsdam is the two-street [[Dutch Quarter]] (''Holländisches Viertel''), an ensemble of buildings that is unique in Europe, with about 150 houses built of red bricks in the Dutch style. It was built between 1734 and 1742 under the direction of Jan Bouman to be used by Dutch artisans and craftsmen who had been invited to settle here by [[Frederick Wilhelm I|King Frederick Wilhelm I]]. Today, this area is one of Potsdam's most visited quarters.

North of the city centre is the [[Russia]]n colony of Alexandrowka, a small enclave of Russian architecture (including an [[Russian Orthodox|Orthodox]] chapel) built in 1825 for a group of Russian immigrants. Since 1999, the colony has been part of the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] [[Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin]].

East of the Alexandrowka colony is a large park, the [[New Garden (Potsdam)|New Garden]] (''Neuer Garten''), which was laid out from 1786 in the [[English landscape garden|English style]]. The site contains two palaces; one of them, the [[Cecilienhof]], was where the [[Potsdam Conference]] was held in July and August 1945. The ''[[Marmorpalais]]'' (Marble Palace) was built in 1789 in Neoclassical style. Nearby is the ''[[Biosphäre Potsdam]]'', a tropical [[botanical garden]].

[[Potsdam-Babelsberg|Babelsberg]], a quarter south-east of the centre, houses the [[Universum Film AG|UFA]] film studios ([[Babelsberg Studios]]), and an extensive [[Babelsberg Park|park]] with some historical buildings, including the [[Babelsberg Palace]] (Schloß Babelsberg, a [[Gothic revival]] palace designed by Schinkel).

The [[Einstein Tower]] is located within the [[Albert Einstein Science Park]], which is on the top of the ''Telegraphenberg'' within an astronomy compound.

Potsdam also features a memorial centre in the former [[KGB]] prison in Leistikowstraße. In the Volkspark to the north, there is one of the last monuments dedicated to Lenin in Germany.

Potsdam joined [[UNESCO]]'s [[Creative Cities Network|Network of Creative Cities]] as a Design City on October 31, 2019 on the occasion of World Cities' Day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/news/unesco-celebrates-world-cities-day-designating-66-new-creative-cities|title=UNESCO celebrates World Cities Day designating 66 new Creative Cities|date=2019-10-30|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>
