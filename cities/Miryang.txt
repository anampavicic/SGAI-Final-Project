'''Miryang''' ({{Korean|hangul=밀양}}) is a [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|city]] in [[Gyeongsangnam-do]] Province, [[South Korea]]. Neighboring cities include [[Changnyeong]] to the west, [[Cheongdo]] to the north, [[Ulsan]] to the east, and [[Yangsan]], [[Gimhae]], and [[Changwon]] to the south.  The city bird is the Korean magpie, the city tree is the pine, and the city flower is the [[royal azalea]].

The recorded history of Miryang begins in the [[Samhan]] period, when it was known as [[Mirimidongguk]].  Due to its strategic location near the [[Nakdong River]], Miryang played an important role from the [[Silla]] period forward.  It served as an important station on the [[Great Yeongnam Road]] during the later [[Joseon Dynasty]], and in the 20th century it became a station on the [[Gyeongbu Line]] railroad that connects [[Busan]] to [[Seoul]].  Miryang remains a key stop along that line, and is now the only city between Busan and [[Daegu]] served by [[KTX]] express trains.

Miryang is known around Korea for the Miryang ''[[arirang]]'' and for the view from the [[Yeongnamnu (Miryang)|Yeongnamnu]] pavilion, subject of numerous poems from the [[Joseon Dynasty]].  Other noted landmarks include [[Eoreumgol]] and the temple of [[Pyochungsa]].  Famous people from Miryang include 15th-century [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] scholar [[Kim Chong-jik]] and 16th-century warrior-monk [[Songun Yu Jeong]].  The city government works actively to maintain the memory of these figures, and of other local cultural features such as the tale of [[Arang (Korean folklore)|Arang]].

==History==
During the [[Samhan]], Miryang may have been part of the territory of [[Mirimidongguk]], one of the [[Byeonhan]] tribes mentioned in the ''[[San guo zhi]]''. Thereafter, it is believed to have been ruled by [[Geumgwan Gaya]] before being annexed by [[Silla]]. The ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'' records Mirimidongguk as being annexed by [[Jijeung of Silla]] in 505. In this period it was known as Chuhwa-gun ({{lang|ko|推火郡}}). Under the general reformation of names carried out by [[Gyeongdeok of Silla|King Gyeongdeok]] in the 8th century, the name was changed to "Milseong-gun" ({{lang|ko|密城郡}}).

In the [[Goryeo]] period (935–1392), Miryang was elevated to the status of a [[zhou (political division)|''ju'']], Mil-ju, by [[Seongjong of Goryeo|King Seongjong]]. In 1194, Miryang was the site of a massive battle between royal forces and a massive rebel army led by Kim Sami of Cheongdo and Hyosim of Ulsan. More than 7,000 rebels were slain.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 143.</ref> Under [[Chungnyeol of Goryeo|King Chungnyeol]] in the late 13th century, local residents led by Jo Cheon rose up against the government; in retaliation, Mil-ju was demoted to a tributary village of [[Gyeongju]] (then Gyerim). Later it became a ''[[hyeon]]''. Under [[Gongyang of Goryeo|King Gongyang]], it was raised to the status of a ''bu''.

With the dawn of the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] period (1392–1910), Miryang first became known by its modern name. Initially demoted from ''bu'' to ''gun'' (county) by [[Taejo of Joseon|King Taejo]], it was then raised back to ''bu'' and its name changed from "Milseong" to "Miryang." Under Taejo's son [[Taejong of Joseon|King Taejong]], it was once again demoted to ''gun''. Later it became a ''dohobu'', or military protectorate, and in 1895 it became a ''gun'' once again; it was to carry this status until late in the 20th century.

Under [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], Miryang was the site of various clashes between the [[Korean independence movement]] and the occupation forces. During the [[March First Movement]] of 1919, approximately 13,500 Miryang residents took part in peaceful demonstrations in support of Korean independence. This led to the "Miryang massacre," in which 150 Korean civilians were shot by occupation troops.<ref>"밀양학살사건" (Miryang haksal sageon, Miryang massacre incident) in Lee (1983), p. 456.</ref> In November 1920, independence fighter Choe Su-bong built and detonated two bombs at the Miryang police station, destroying the structure. He attempted to kill himself but was unsuccessful; later he was put to death and his accomplices were imprisoned.<ref>"밀양경찰서 폭파사건" (Miryang gyeongchalseo pokpa sageon, Miryang police station bombing incident) in Lee (1983), p. 455.</ref>

In 1989 the city center was separated from the rest of Miryang and named "Miryang-si" (Miryang City). In 1995 the city center was reunited with the hinterland and the entire region became known as Miryang-si. Both of these were part of general reorganizations of South Korean local government.

Miryang gained national attention as the location of a [[Miryang gang rape|gang rape incident in 2004]].

==Geography and climate==
[[File:Miryang from south.jpg|thumb|right|Miryang city centre as seen from across the Miryang River.]]
Miryang's geography is heavily influenced by the two rivers which flow through it, the Miryang and [[Nakdong River|Nakdong]] Rivers.  All of Miryang lies within the Nakdong basin, and the Nakdong River itself runs along Miryang's southern border.  The city's topography generally slopes from the high peaks of the [[Yeongnam Alps]] in the northeast to the Nakdong valley in the southwest.  Much of the city is drained by the [[Miryang River]], which rises in western Ulsan and flows through the city center to join the Nakdong at [[Samnangjin]].  Portions are drained by other Nakdong tributaries, including the Naejincheon.

The Miryang River valley south of the city center broadens into a fertile plain.  This area, including large portions of [[Samnangjin-eup]], Sangnam-myeon, and [[Hanam-eup]], serves as a local breadbasket and is almost entirely devoted to rice-farming.  In Hanam-eup, it joins another plain running along the Nakdong.

As elsewhere in the [[Yeongnam]] region, the landscape is very lumpy, with many craggy hills and low mountains.  The highest mountain in Miryang is [[Gajisan (Gyeongsang-do)|Gajisan]] ({{cvt|1240|m|disp=comma}}), which stands on the northern border.  Other high peaks along the border include [[Hwaaksan]] and [[Cheonhwangsan (Gyeongsangnam-do/Ulsan)|Cheonhwangsan]] (also called Jaeyaksan).  These peaks are part of the Yeongnam Alps, a branch of the [[Taebaek Mountains]].

Further south, the mountains are lower but still quite frequent.  Notable peaks in this area include [[Maneosan]] in Samnangjin and [[Cheontaesan (Gyeongsangnam-do)|Cheontaesan]] on the border with [[Yangsan]].  Steep mountain valleys abound; these are often used for reservoirs that store water for irrigation or drinking purposes.  Some of the larger reservoirs in Miryang include [[Miryang Lake]] and [[Antae Lake]].

===Climate===
Like most of the rest of South Korea, Miryang enjoys a relatively mild temperate climate. The average windspeed is about {{cvt|1.4|m/s|km/h mph}}, the average temperature {{cvt|14.4|°C}}, and the annual rainfall in 2004 was {{cvt|1377.4|mm}}.<ref>[http://cal.miryang.go.kr/view.asp?t_idx=18 "5. 기상개황" in Miryang City (2005).  Retrieved September 26, 2006 from] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928004021/http://cal.miryang.go.kr/view.asp?t_idx=18 |date=September 28, 2007 }}</ref>

The mountains along its north flank afford Miryang a measure of shelter from heavy winds and other severe weather coming from the north.  On the other hand, it is relatively vulnerable to damage from tropical storms encroaching from the south.

The Miryang and Nakdong valleys are subject to frequent floods during typhoons, as well as more predictable flooding during the [[East Asian monsoon|monsoon season]].  Other natural disasters are uncommon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miryang.go.kr/kor/introduction/04_02_04.html |script-title=ko:자연 및 환경재해 (Jayeon mit hwan-gyeong jaehae, Natural and environmental disasters) |work=Miryang City website |access-date=2006-09-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040813041811/http://www.miryang.go.kr/kor/introduction/04_02_04.html |archive-date=August 13, 2004 }}</ref>

==Administrative divisions==
Miryang is divided into 16 primary divisions, of which 2 are ''eup'' (large villages [towns]), 5 are ''dong'' (city precincts [neighborhoods]), and 9 are ''myeon'' (rural areas [townships or sub-counties]).   Some of the ''dong'' are further subdivided, so that the city center is composed of eight legal ''dong'' in total.  The ''eup'' and ''myeon'' are broken into ''ri'', of which Miryang has a total of 265 administrative or 119 legal.

==Government and politics==
[[File:Miryang assembly.jpg|thumb|right|Miryang assembly building.]]
Like other cities and counties in South Korea, Miryang enjoys a limited degree of local autonomy.  Since 1995, the mayor and city council have been elected directly by the local citizens.

The current mayor is {{Ill|Park Il-ho|ko|박일호}}, a member of the [[United Future Party]] (미래통합당). He took office on June 30, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Past Mayors|url=https://eng.miryang.go.kr/sub/02_01_02.php|access-date=2020-08-30|work=Miryang.go.kr|language=en}}</ref>

==Economy==
The economy of Miryang draws heavily on its central location and prominence as a tourist destination.  In addition, [[agriculture in South Korea|agriculture]] continues to play an important role, particularly in outlying districts.  The Miryang River valley supports extensive rice farming operations, while livestock farming is more common on higher ground.

===Transportation===
[[File:Miryang station big.jpg|thumb|left|Miryang station]]
Miryang is roughly equidistant from Daegu and Busan, and is connected to both cities by road and rail.  By road, Miryang is served by two exits on the [[Daegu-Busan Expressway]], as well as numerous national and local highways.  By rail, it is served both by the [[Gyeongbu Line]] (Seoul-Busan) and the [[Gyeongjeon Line]] (to [[Masan]]); the northern terminus of the Gyeongjeon Line lies just north of [[Samnangjin]] near the meeting of the Nakdong and Miryang Rivers.  Miryang is the only city between Daegu and Busan currently served by the KTX express train.

In addition to [[Miryang station]] in the city center, outlying regions are served by [[Samnangjin]] station and [[Sangdong-myeon|Sangdong]] station on the Gyeongbu Line, and [[Nakdonggang station]] on the Gyeongjeon Line.  These outlying stations are served only by a small number of [[Mugunghwa-ho]] passenger trains.

Except for Nakdonggang station, the stations in Miryang also serve freight trains.  The most active freight station is Sangdong, which sent out 74,762 tons of freight in 2004.<ref>Statistical Yearbook of Miryang, {{cite web |script-title=ko:5. 철도수송|url=http://cal.miryang.go.kr/view.asp?t_idx=141|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040107202502/http://cal.miryang.go.kr/view.asp?t_idx=141|url-status=dead|archive-date=2004-01-07|access-date=2006-09-22}}</ref>

==Culture==
[[File:Miryang arirang statue.jpg|thumb|right|Statue commemorating the Miryang arirang.]]
{{Main|Korean culture}}
Miryang is known as the home of the Miryang arirang.  This is sometimes considered to be close to the original version of the arirang, which may have drawn its name from the Miryang area folktale of [[Arang (Korean folklore)|Arang]].  The Miryang Arirang Festival is held each May to commemorate and keep alive this tradition and other aspects of local heritage.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=68173 |script-title=ko:밀양아리랑대축제|encyclopedia=Naver Encyclopedia|access-date=2006-09-26}}</ref>

Other preserved aspects of Korean traditional culture are the [[Baekjung]] performances.

The people of Miryang speak a version of the [[Gyeongsang dialect]] of [[Korean language|Korean]].  In studies of [[Dialects of Korean|Korean dialectology]], Miryang dialect has been contrasted with the Changwon dialect in terms of the use of pitch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.korean.go.kr/nkview/kyear/2004/2004_05.html |script-title=ko:음성학/음운론|work=새국어생활 (New Korean Life)|year=2004|author=Shin, Ji-yeong (신지영)}}</ref>

Miryang is notable for being filming location and the setting of the 2007 film ''[[Secret Sunshine|Miryang]]'' (released in English-language markets under the title ''Secret Sunshine'').<ref>{{Citation|title=Secret Sunshine|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0817225/|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>

==Education==
The history of education in Miryang can be traced back to the [[Goryeo]] period, when a ''[[hyanggyo]]'', a government-run village school, was constructed in the town center (modern-day [[Gyo-dong (Miryang)|Gyo-dong]]).  This school, famed for its size,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |script-title=ko:밀양향교|encyclopedia=Naver Encyclopedia|url=http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=738085|access-date=2006-09-26}}</ref> continued in operation through the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] period, although it was gradually supplanted by numerous local [[seodang]] and [[seowon]]. All of these institutions concentrated on training young men for the [[gwageo|royal civil service examinations]].  This system lasted until the abolition of the examinations in the [[Gabo Reforms]] of 1894.

Today in Miryang, as elsewhere in South Korea, compulsory public education is provided for all students through middle school, and almost all students complete high school as well.  Education within the city is overseen by the Miryang Office of Education, which is administered directly by the Gyeongsangnam-do provincial Office of Education.  This is in turn accountable to the national [[Ministry of Education (South Korea)|Ministry of Education]], which sets the national curriculum for all schools.

There are 23 elementary schools, 14 middle schools, and 8 high schools in Miryang.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=ko:학교/소속기관 현황 (Hakgyo/sosok-gigwan hyeonhwang, Statistics on school schools and affiliated institutions)|url=http://www.eduml.or.kr/introduction/main_5_6.html|work=Miryang Office of Education website|access-date=2006-09-26|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050816123557/http://www.eduml.or.kr/introduction/main_5_6.html|archive-date=2005-08-16}}</ref>  Supplementary private education is offered through [[hagwon]]s, which are strongly concentrated in the city center, with some in outlying towns.

[[File:PNU Miryang main.jpg|thumb|left|Main administration building at the Miryang campus of [[Pusan National University]].]]
There is only one institution of higher education in Miryang.  This is the Miryang campus of [[Pusan National University]].  The Miryang campus primarily serves science and technology students, hosting the College of Nano Science and Technology and the College of Biological Sciences.<ref>{{Cite web|title=PNU Focus|url=https://www.pusan.ac.kr/eng/CMS/Contents/Contents.do?mCode=MN078|access-date=Aug 30, 2020|website=Pusan National University}}</ref>  It is located in northern [[Samnangjin-eup]], roughly 9&nbsp;km from the Miryang city center.  A branch campus, formerly the main campus, is located near downtown Miryang.  These two campuses were merged into Pusan National University in 2006.  Previously, they made up a separate university called [[:ko:밀양대학교|Miryang National University]], which traced its roots back to 1923.

==Tourism==
[[File:Yeongnamru Miryang Gyeongsangnamdo.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Yeongnamnu (Miryang)|Yeongnamnu]]]]
Miryang has been known for centuries for its scenery of mountains and valleys; the [[Yeongnamnu (Miryang)|Yeongnamnu]] pavilion overlooking the Miryang River appears in numerous Joseon Dynasty writings. The northeastern corner of the city occupies a portion of the [[Yeongnam Alps]]; part of this region is included in [[Gajisan (Ulsan/Gyeongsang)|Gajisan]] Provincial Park.  Noted natural landmarks include the "ice valley" of [[Eoreumgol]], also located in the northeast.

A number of noted historic landmarks are found in Miryang.  These include various [[seowon]], or Confucian academies, including the [[Yerim Seowon]] dedicated to [[Kim Chong-jik]] and the [[Pyochung Seowon]], which is the only seowon constructed inside a Buddhist temple ([[Pyochungsa]]).  The Yeongnamnu pavilion and nearby buildings date from the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] and [[Goryeo]] periods.  [[National treasures of South Korea|South Korean National Treasure]] No. 75 is located at Pyochungsa.

Yangyangji, which was built during the [[Silla Dynasty]], was a water reservoir for the rice paddies, but it lost its original function due to a huge additional reservoir. But instead of putting water on the rice fields, the park attracts many tourists with picturesque scenery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://korean.visitkorea.or.kr/kor/bz15/where/where_tour.jsp?cid=2545984&gotoPage= |script-title=ko:양양지(위양못)|website=korean.visitkorea.or.kr|language=ko|access-date=2018-06-06}}</ref>
