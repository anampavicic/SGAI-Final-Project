== History ==
Higashiōmi is part of ancient  [[Ōmi Province]]. Portions of the area were under the control of [[Yamakami Domain]], a 13,000 ''[[koku]]'' ''[[fudai daimyo|fudai]]'' territory during the [[Edo period]] [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. With the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889, the town of [[Yōkaichi, Shiga|Yōkaichi]] was established within [[Gamō District, Shiga]]. Yōkaichi merged with the villages of Hirata, Ichinobe, and Tamano in Gamō District, and Misono and Takebe from [[Kanzaki District, Shiga|Kanzaki District]] and was elevated to city status on August 15, 1954. The city of Higashiōmi was established on February 11, 2005, from the merger of Yōkaichi with the towns of [[Eigenji, Shiga|Eigenji]] and [[Gokashō, Shiga|Gokashō]] (both from Kanzaki District), and the towns of [[Aitō, Shiga|Aitō]] and [[Kotō, Shiga|Kotō]] (both from [[Echi District, Shiga|Echi District]]).

On January 1, 2006, the town of [[Notogawa, Shiga|Notogawa]] (from Kanzaki District), and the town of [[Gamō, Shiga|Gamō]] (from Gamō District) were merged into Higashiōmi.

==Government==
Higashiōmi has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 25 members. Higashiōmi, together with the town of Ryūō, contributes three members to the Shiga Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Shiga 2nd district and Shiga 4th district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
The economy of Higashiōmi is centered on agriculture and light manufacturing. There are several [[industrial park]]s in the city. [[Murata Manufacturing]], [[Kyocera]], [[Panasonic]], [[Suntory]] and [[Toppan]] have large factories in the city.

==Education==
Higashiōmi has 22 public elementary schools and ten public middle schools operated by the city government. There are five public high schools operated by the Shiga Prefectural Department of Education. The prefecture also operates one special education school for the handicapped.  The [[Biwako-Gakuin University]], a private's university with associated junior college, is also located in Higashiōmi.
