== History ==
[[File:Somanatha view-II.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Somnath Temple]] at the [[Prabhas Patan]], Veraval.]]
Veraval was founded in 13th or 14th century by Rao Veravalji Vadher, a [[Rajput]]. Present name is believed to be derived from its old name "Velakul" meaning Port City. Veraval was once a fortified port town of the royal family of Junagadh. It was a part of the Kingdom of Junagadh till 1947 when [[Junagadh]] was merged with India. The city still bears some remnants of the old Nawabi heritage, the Nawabi summer palace being among them. There are ruins of the old Nawabi fort and Nawabi Gates in and around the place. The old walls of the port are now ruined, but the impressive Junagadh gate and the Patan gate are still seen, but are in a very bad state.

The Nawabi Palace with Gothic features which is one of the main attractions. It is popularly known as Somnath College (the palace was converted into a college after it was abandoned by the Nawab). At present it is the building of a Sanskrit university. The town is often known as the gateway to the magnificent  [[Somnath Temple]] and the pilgrimage centres of [[Prabhas Patan]] and Bhalkha. Veraval is also the nearest town to the [[Gir National Park]] (42&nbsp;km away).

Before the rise of Surat, Veraval was the major seaport for pilgrims to [[Mecca]]. Its importance now is as a fishing port, one of the largest in India. Seafaring dhows and wooden fishing boats are still built by the fishermen without the use of any modern technology. Traditional skills are passed down from father to son.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}
