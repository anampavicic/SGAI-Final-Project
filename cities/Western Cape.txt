The '''Western Cape''' ({{langx|af|Wes-Kaap}} {{IPA|af|ˈvɛskɑːp|}}; {{langx|xh|iNtshona-Koloni}}) is a [[provinces of South Africa|province]] of [[South Africa]], situated on the south-western coast of the country. It is the [[List of South African provinces by area|fourth largest of the nine provinces]] with an area of {{convert|129449|km2}}, and [[List of South African provinces by population|the third most populous]], with an estimated 7&nbsp;million inhabitants in 2020.<ref>Statistics South Africa, 2020. Mid- year population estimates. Available: http://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/P0302/P03022020.pdf</ref> About two-thirds of these inhabitants live in the metropolitan area of [[Cape Town]], which is also the provincial capital. The Western Cape was created in 1994 from part of the former [[Cape Province]]. The two largest cities are [[Cape Town]] and [[George, Western Cape|George]].

== Geography ==
[[File:Western Cape topography labelled (with provincial labels).svg|thumb|400px|left|Topography of the Western Cape. The Roggeveld and Nuweveld mountains are part of the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]] (see diagrams below). The other mountain ranges belong to the [[Cape Fold Belt]], also shown in the diagrams below. The Western Cape's inland boundary lies for the most part at the foot of the Great Escarpment.]]

The Western Cape is roughly L-shaped, extending north and east from the [[Cape of Good Hope]], in the southwestern corner of South Africa. It stretches about {{convert|400|km}} northwards along the Atlantic coast and about {{convert|500|km|-2}} eastwards along the South African south coast ([[Southern Indian Ocean]]). It is bordered on the north by the [[Northern Cape]] and on the east by the [[Eastern Cape]]. The total land area of the province is {{convert|129462|km2}},<ref name="cib2011" />{{rp|9}} about 10.6% of the country's total. It is roughly the size of [[England]] or the [[State of Louisiana]]. Its capital city and largest city is [[Cape Town]], and some other major cities include [[Stellenbosch]], [[Worcester, Western Cape|Worcester]], [[Paarl]], and [[George, South Africa|George]]. The [[Garden Route]] and the [[Overberg]] are popular coastal tourism areas.

The Western Cape is the southernmost region of the African continent with [[Cape Agulhas]] as its southernmost point, only {{convert|3800|km}} from the Antarctic coastline. The coastline varies from sandy between capes, to rocky to steep and mountainous in places. The only natural harbour is [[Saldanha Bay]] on the west coast, about {{convert|140|km|-1}} north of Cape Town. However a lack of fresh water in the region meant that it has only recently been used as a harbour.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}} The province's main harbour was built in [[Table Bay]], which in its natural state was fully exposed to the northwesterly storms that bring rain to the province in winter, as well as the almost uninterrupted dry southeasterly winds in summer. But fresh water coming off [[Table Mountain]] and [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]] allowed the early European settlers to build Cape Town on the shores of this less than satisfactory anchorage.


=== Topography ===
The province is topographically exceptionally diverse. Most of the province falls within the [[Cape Fold Belt]], a set of nearly parallel ranges of [[Table Mountain Sandstone (Geological Formation)|sandstone folded mountains]] of [[Cambrian]]-[[Ordovician]] age (the age of the rocks is from 510 to about 330&nbsp;million years ago; their folding into mountains occurred about 350 to about 270&nbsp;million years ago).<ref name=compton>Compton, J. S. (2004). ''The Rocks and Mountains of Cape Town''. pp. 24-26, 44–70. Double Storey Books, Cape Town.</ref><ref name=McCarthy>McCarthy, T., Rubridge, B. (2005). ''The Story of Earth and Life''. pp. 188–195, 262–266. Struik Publishers, Cape Town.</ref><ref name=Truswell>Truswell, J.F. (1977). ''The Geological Evolution of South Africa''. pp. 93–96, 114–159. Purnell, Cape Town.</ref> The height of the mountain peaks in the different ranges varies from {{convert|1000|m}} to {{convert|2300|m}}. The valleys between ranges are generally very fertile, as they contain the weathered loamy soils of the [[Cape Fold Belt#Bokkeveld Group|Bokkeveld mudstones]] (see the diagrams below).<ref name=McCarthy />

The far interior forms part of the [[Karoo]]. This region of the province is generally arid and hilly, with a [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|prominent escarpment]] that runs close to the Province's most inland boundary.

The colour code for the geological layers is the same as those used in the diagram above. The heavy black line flanked by opposing arrows is the fault that runs for nearly 300&nbsp;km along the southern edge of the [[Swartberg]] Mountains. The Swartberg Mountain range owes some of its great height to upliftment along this fault line. The subsurface structures are not to scale.
</gallery>

==== Escarpment ====
The [[escarpment]] marks the southwestern edge of [[Geography of South Africa#Topographical Divisions|South Africa's central plateau]] (see the middle and bottom diagrams on the left).<ref name=McCarthy /><ref name= "Altas">''Atlas of Southern Africa''. (1984). p. 13. Reader's Digest Association, Cape Town</ref> It runs parallel to the entire South African coastline, except in the very far northeast, where it is interrupted by the [[Limpopo River]] valley, and in the far northwest, where it is interrupted by the [[Orange River]] valley. The {{convert|1000|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} northeastern stretch of the escarpment is called the [[Drakensberg]], which is geographically and geologically quite distinct from the [[Cape Fold Belt#Cape Supergroup|Cape Fold Mountains]], which originated much earlier and totally independently of the origin of the escarpment.<ref name=McCarthy /><ref name=Truswell /><ref name= McCarthy1>McCarthy, T.S.

(2006). ''Geological Journeys''. p.290-300. Struik Publishers, Cape Town.</ref>

==== Rivers ====
The principal rivers of the province are the [[Berg River|Berg]] and [[Olifants River (Western Cape)|Olifants]] which drain into the Atlantic Ocean, and the [[Breede River|Breede]] and [[Gourits River|Gourits]] which drain into the Indian Ocean.

The vegetation of the region is also extremely diverse, with one of the world's seven [[floral kingdom]]s almost exclusively endemic to the province, namely the [[Cape floristic region|Cape Floral Kingdom]], most of which is covered by [[Fynbos]] (from the Afrikaans meaning "Fine Bush" (Dutch: Fijnbos), though precisely how it came to be referred to as such, is uncertain.).<ref name=manning>{{cite book|last1=Manning|first1=John|title=Field Guide to Fynbos|date=2007|publisher=Struik Publishers|location=Cape Town| isbn=9781770072657|pages=8–23|chapter=The World of Fynbos}}</ref><ref name=maytham>{{cite book|last1=Trinder-Smith|first1=Terry|title=Wild Flowers of the Table Mountain National Park|date=2006|publisher=Botanical Society of South Africa|location=Cape Town| isbn=1874999600|pages=19–35|chapter=Introduction}}</ref> These evergreen heathlands are extremely rich in species diversity,<ref name=manning /><ref name=maytham /> with at least as many plant species occurring on [[Table Mountain]] as in the entire United Kingdom.<ref name=maytham /> It is characterised by various types of shrubs, thousands of herbaceous flowering plant species and some grasses.<ref name=manning /> With the exception of the Silver tree, ''[[Leucadendron argenteum]]'', which only grows on the granite and clay soils of the [[Cape Peninsula]],<ref name=manning2>{{cite book|last1=Manning|first1=John|title=Field Guide to Fynbos|date=2007|publisher=Struik Publishers|location=Cape Town| isbn=9781770072657|page=258|chapter=Cone Bush, Tolbos}}</ref> open fynbos is generally treeless except in the wetter mountain ravines where patches of [[Afromontane forest]] persist.<ref name=manning /><ref name=maytham />

The arid interior is dominated by [[Karoo#Karoo flora|Karoo drought-resistant shrubbery]].{{citation needed|date=June 2022}} The [[Geography of South Africa#Namaqualand|West Coast]] and [[Karoo#Divisions|Little Karoo]] are [[semi-arid]] regions and are typified by many species of succulents and drought-resistant shrubs and [[acacia]] trees. The [[Garden Route]] on the south coast (between the [[Outeniqua Mountains]] and the [[Southern Indian Ocean]]) is extremely lush, with temperate rainforest (or [[Knysna-Amatole montane forests|Afromontane Forest]]) covering many areas adjacent to the coast, in the deep river valleys and along the southern slopes of the Outeniqua mountain range.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}} Typical species are hardwoods of exceptional height, such as [[Podocarpus|Yellowwood]], [[Stinkwood]] and [[Ironwood]] trees.

=== Climate ===
The Western Cape is climatologically diverse, with many distinct micro- and macroclimates created by the varied topography and the influence of the surrounding ocean currents. These are the warm [[Agulhas Current]] which flows southwards along South Africa's east coast, and the cold [[Benguela Current]] which is an upwelling current from the depths of the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] along South Africa's west coast.<ref name=Branch>Branch, M & Branch G. (1981). ''The Living Shores of Southern Africa.'' pp. 14–18. Struik Publishers, Cape Town.</ref><ref name=tyson>Tyson, P.D., Preston-Whyte, R.A. (2000) ''The Weather and Climate of Southern Africa''. pp. 221–223. Oxford University Press, Cape Town</ref> Thus climatic statistics can vary greatly over short distances. Most of the province is considered to have a [[Mediterranean climate]] with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Both the [[Karoo|Great Karoo and Little Karoo]], in the interior, have an [[arid]] to [[semi-arid]] climate with cold, frosty winters and hot summers with occasional [[thunderstorms]]. The [[Garden Route]] and the [[Overberg]] on the south coast have a maritime climate with cool, moist winters and mild, moist summers. [[Mossel Bay]] in the Garden Route is considered{{By whom|date=May 2021}} to have the second mildest climate worldwide after Hawaii.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}} The La Niña phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation cycle tends to increase rainfall in this region in the dry season (November to April).<ref name="Carlowicz 2021" >{{cite web |url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/149201/la-nina-returns-for-a-second-winter |first=Michael |last=Carlowicz |title=La Niña Returns for a Second Winter |website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov |date=1 December 2021 |access-date=16 December 2021 }}</ref>

The effects of El Niño on rainfall in southern Africa differ between the summer and winter rainfall areas. Winter rainfall areas tend to get higher rainfall than normal and summer rainfall areas tend to get less rain. The effect on the summer rainfall areas is stronger and has led to severe drought in strong El Niño events.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://reliefweb.int/report/madagascar/southern-africa-el-nino-positive-indian-ocean-dipole-forecast-and-humanitarian-impact-october-2023 |title=Southern Africa: El Niño, Positive Indian Ocean Dipole Forecast and Humanitarian Impact (October 2023) |date=16 October 2023 |access-date=20 January 2024 |publisher=OCHA |website=reliefweb.int }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url= |title=South African extreme weather during the 1877–1878 El Niño |first1=Yuri |last1=Brugnara |first2=Stefan |last2=Brönnimann |first3=Stefan |last3=Grab |first4=Jessica |last4=Steinkopf |first5=Angela-Maria |last5=Burgdorf |first6=Clive |last6=Wilkinson |first7=Rob |last7=Allan |journal=Weather |doi=10.1002/wea.4468 |volume=78 |issue=10 |date=October 2023 |pages=286–293 |bibcode=2023Wthr...78..286B }}</ref>

Sea surface temperatures off the west and south coasts of South Africa are affected by ENSO via changes in surface wind strength.<ref name="Nhesvure 2020" >Nhesvure, B. (2020). Impacts of ENSO on coastal South African sea surface temperatures. Faculty of Science, Department of Oceanography. Retrieved from http://hdl.handle.net/11427/32954/ </ref> During El Niño the south-easterly winds driving upwelling are weaker which results in warmer coastal waters than normal, while during La Niña the same winds are stronger and cause colder coastal waters. These effects on the winds are part of large scale influences on the tropical Atlantic and the [[South Atlantic High]]-pressure system, and changes to the pattern of westerly winds further south. There are other influences not known to be related to ENSO of similar importance. Some ENSO events do not lead to the expected changes.<ref name="Nhesvure 2020" />

Thunderstorms are generally rare in the province (except in the [[Karoo]]) with most precipitation being of a [[Cold front|frontal]] or [[orographic]] nature. Extremes of heat and cold are common inland, but rare near the coast. Snow is a common winter occurrence on the [[Cape Fold Belt|Western Cape Mountains]] occasionally reaching down into the more inland valleys. Otherwise, frost is relatively rare in coastal areas and many of the heavily cultivated valleys.

==Political history==
{{Politics of Western Cape}}

=== Cape Liberal Tradition ===
The Cape has had a long tradition of holding liberal values.<ref>J. Lewis: ''The Rise and Fall of the South African Peasantry: A Critique and Reassessment.'' Journal of Southern African Studies, XI, 1. 1984.</ref> For example, the Cape Qualified Franchise before the Union of South Africa.

==== Cape Qualified Franchise ====
{{Main|Cape Qualified Franchise}}
The Cape Qualified Franchise was the system of non-racial [[Suffrage|franchise]] that was adhered to in the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]], and in the [[Cape Province]] in the early years of the [[Union of South Africa]]. Qualifications for the right to vote at parliamentary elections were applied equally to all men, regardless of race.

This local system of multi-racial suffrage was later gradually restricted, and eventually abolished, under various [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] and [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]] governments. In 1930 [[White South African|white]] [[Women's Enfranchisement Act, 1930|women were enfranchised]], and in 1931 [[Franchise Laws Amendment Act, 1931|property qualifications for white voters were removed]]. In 1936 [[Bantu peoples in South Africa|black]] voters were then removed from the common voters' rolls and [[Representation of Natives Act, 1936|allowed only to elect separate members]] in 1936, and subsequently [[Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act, 1959|denied all representation]] in the [[House of Assembly (South Africa)|House of Assembly]] in 1960. [[Coloured]] voters [[Coloured vote constitutional crisis|similarly followed]] in [[Separate Representation of Voters Act, 1951|1958]] and [[Separate Representation of Voters Amendment Act, 1968|1970]], respectively.

==== Contribution of the Western Cape in the National Youth Uprisings ====
The [[Black Consciousness Movement]] (BCM) was a grassroots anti-Apartheid activist movement that emerged in South Africa in the mid-1960s out of the political vacuum created by the jailing and banning of the African National Congress and Pan Africanist Congress leadership after the Sharpeville Massacre in 1960. The BCM represented a social movement for political consciousness.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Ideology of the Black Consciousness Movement |url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/ideology-black-consciousness-movement |website=South African History Online |access-date=6 September 2019}}</ref>

In December 1968, the [[South African Student Organization]] (SASO) was formed at a conference held in Marianhill, Natal. The conference was exclusively attended by Black students. After its launch, SASO became the medium through which black consciousness ideology spread to schools and other university campuses across the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.sahistory.org.za/cape-town/black-consciousness-and-student-revolt-cape|title = Black Consciousness and Student Revolt in the Cape|access-date = 16 June 2014|website = South African History Online}}</ref>

In 1974, South African Minister of Bantu Education and Development MC Botha, constituted the imposition of using [[Afrikaans]] as a medium of instruction in black schools, effective with students in Grade 7 (Standard 5) upwards.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Afrikaans Medium Decree |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/the-afrikaans-medium-decree-43416 |website=ThoughtCo |access-date=6 September 2019}}</ref> As early as March 1976, students began passive resistance against Afrikaans, fueling the outbreak of the [[Soweto uprising|Soweto Uprising]] on 16 June 1976. Consequently, the student protests spread to other parts of the country, and [[Cape Town]] became a pivotal site for Western Cape student revolt.<ref>{{cite news |title=African South Africans' June 16th 1976 Revolt—Sad Times, Bad Times—A Luta Kontinua! AMANDLA! POWER! |url=https://owlcation.com/humanities/African-South-Africans-and-June-16th-1976-Sad-Times-Bad-Times-Aluta-Kontinua-AMANDLA |newspaper=Owlcation |access-date=6 September 2019}}</ref>

Student leaders at the [[University of the Western Cape]] (UWC) and the [[University of Cape Town]] (UCT) organised marches. Poster parades by UWC and Black Power Salute marches by UCT was broken by the police, resulting in 73 students getting arrested and detained at [[Victor Verster Prison]], near Paarl.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

On 1 September 1976, the unrest spread to the city of Cape Town itself. Approximately 2000 black students from Western Cape townships, namely Langa, Nyanga and Gugulethu, matched the Cape Town central business district (CBD). Coloured students also contributed to the protests by peacefully marching to the city, but were blockaded by the police in the CBD. The protests turned violent when coloured students started burning schools, libraries and a magistrate's court in support of the student revolt. Thereafter, 200,000 coloured workers partook in a two-day strike staying away from work in the Cape Town area.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

According to a report by the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC), the Western Cape experienced the second highest number of deaths and casualties associated with the 1976 uprising protests.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.sahistory.org.za/cape-town/black-consciousness-and-student-revolt-cape|title = Black consciousness and student revolt in Cape Town|access-date = 14 June 2014|website = South African History Online}}</ref>

==== 1994 and the Western Cape post-apartheid ====
In 1994, at the introduction of the [[Interim Constitution of South Africa|Interim Constitution]] and the [[South African general election, 1994|first non-racial election]], South Africa's original provinces and [[bantustan]]s were abolished and [[Provinces of South Africa|nine new provinces]] were established. The former [[Cape Province]] was divided into the Western Cape, [[Northern Cape]], Eastern Cape and part of [[North West (South African province)|North West]].

In the 1994 election, the Western Cape was one of two provinces that did not elect an [[African National Congress]] (ANC) provincial government (the other being [[KwaZulu-Natal]]). The [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] (NP) won 53% of the votes and 23 seats in the 42-seat provincial legislature, and [[Hernus Kriel]], a former Minister of Law and Order, was elected [[Premier of the Western Cape|Premier]]. He resigned in 1998 and was replaced by [[Gerald Morkel]].

The [[South African general election, 1999|1999 election]] marked the beginning of a period of great turbulence in Western Cape politics. No party achieved an absolute majority in the provincial parliament, as the ANC won 18 seats while the [[New National Party (South Africa)|New National Party]] (NNP), successor to the NP, won 17. The NNP went into coalition with the [[Democratic Party (South Africa)|Democratic Party]] (DP), which won 5 seats, to form a government, and Morkel remained Premier. In 2000 the DP and the NNP formalised their coalition by forming the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] (DA).

In 2001, however, the NNP broke with the DA over the removal of [[Peter Marais]] from office as [[Mayor of Cape Town]] by DA leader [[Tony Leon]]. The NNP instead went into coalition with the ANC; Gerald Morkel, who was opposed to the split, resigned as Premier and was replaced by Peter Marais. In 2002 Marais resigned as Premier due to a sexual harassment scandal, and was replaced by NNP leader [[Marthinus van Schalkwyk]]. During the [[2003 South African floor-crossing window period|2003 floor-crossing period]] four members of the provincial parliament crossed to the ANC, giving it an absolute majority of 22 seats in the 42-seat house. However, the ANC remained in coalition with the NNP and van Schalkwyk remained as Premier.

In the [[South African general election, 2004|2004 election]], there was again no absolute winner in the provincial parliament; this time the ANC won 19 seats, the DA won 12, and the NNP won 5. The ANC-NNP coalition continued in power, but van Schalkwyk took up a ministerial post in the national cabinet and was replaced as Premier by the ANC's [[Ebrahim Rasool]]. The NNP was finally dissolved after the [[2005 South African floor-crossing window period|2005 floor-crossing period]] and its members joined the ANC, again giving that party an absolute majority of 24 seats. In the [[2007 South African floor-crossing window period|2007 floor-crossing period]] the ANC gained a further three members of the provincial parliament. In 2008 Rasool resigned as Premier due to internal party politics, and was replaced by [[Lynne Brown]].

The [[South African general election, 2009|2009 election]] marked a significant change in Western Cape politics, as the Democratic Alliance won 51% of the votes and an absolute majority of 22 seats in the provincial parliament, while the ANC won 14 seats with 31% of the vote. The DA leader [[Helen Zille]] was elected Premier. In 2010 the [[Independent Democrats]], which had won 3 seats with 5% of the vote, merged with the DA. In the [[South African general election, 2014|2014 election]] the DA won 59% of the votes and an absolute majority of 26 seats in the provincial parliament, while the ANC won 14 seats with 32% of the vote. In 2018 King Khoebaha Cornelius III Declared the independence of the "Sovereign State of Good Hope".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://citizen.co.za/news/south-africa/1982550/khoi-san-king-declares-that-the-cape-has-seceded-from-sa/|title=Khoi-San king declares that the Cape has seceded from SA|first=Charles|last=Cilliers|date=17 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thesouthafrican.com/khoisan-nation-serves-cape-town-parliament-with-eviction-notice/|title=Khoisan Nation serves Cape Town parliament with eviction notice|date=18 July 2018}}</ref>

In the [[2019 South African general election|2019 election]], the DA retained their majority in the province, but with a reduction in support. It had won 24 seats with 55%. Helen Zille was term-limited and the DA premier candidate [[Alan Winde]] succeeded her. The ANC also lost support. It had received 12 seats with 28% support, its lowest showing since 1994. Veteran politician [[Peter Marais]] returned to the provincial parliament as the sole representative of the [[Freedom Front Plus]]. Patricia de Lille formed another party, [[Good (political party)|Good]], and it achieved a seat.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Makinana |first1=Andisiwe |title=It's official: DA has comfortably won the Western CapeIt's official: DA has comfortably won the Western Cape |url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2019-05-10-democratic-alliance-officially-wins-the-western-cape-vote/ |access-date=1 April 2020 |newspaper=TimesLIVE |date=10 May 2019}}</ref>

The DA continued to win a majority of the votes in the [[2021 South African municipal elections|2021 municipal elections]], receiving 54% of the vote province-wide, with support in Cape Town at 58%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://results.elections.org.za/dashboards/lge/|title=IEC Results Dashboard|website=results.elections.org.za}}</ref>

=== Cape Independence Movement ===
{{Main|Cape independence}}

Since the late 2000s there has been growing support for Western Cape, or Greater Cape, independence from South Africa.{{Citation needed|date=January 2024}} Political parties such as the [[Referendum Party (South Africa)|Referendum Party]], [[Freedom Front Plus]] and organisations such as the Cape Independence Advocacy Group<ref>{{Cite web|last=Charles|first=Marvin|title=Cape Independence: Lobby group says recent survey 'places intense pressure' on DA to hold referendum|url=https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/news/cape-independence-lobby-group-says-recent-survey-places-intense-pressure-on-da-to-hold-referendum-20210813|access-date=2021-10-20|website=News24|language=en-US}}</ref> and CapeXit,<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-05-31|title=The CapeXit mission: Can this be Brexit for the Western Cape?|url=https://www.thesouthafrican.com/lifestyle/capexit-independent-country-western-cape/|access-date=2021-10-20|website=The South African|language=en-ZA}}</ref> wish to bring forth the constitutional and peaceful secession of the Western Cape.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=An independent Western Cape on the cards?

Proponents claim substantial support for the idea, with CapeXit having over 800,000 signed mandates in May 2021. Additionally, a poll conducted in 2023 by Victory Research on behalf of the Cape Independence Advocacy Group claimed that 58% of the Western Cape's registered voters would support independence, while 68% would support a referendum on the issue.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-09-11|title=Cape Independence Polling Results for 2023|url=https://www.capeindependence.org/post/ciag-poll-aug-2023}}</ref>

==Law and government==
{{main|Government of the Western Cape|Politics of the Western Cape}}
[[File:Western Cape provincial building.jpg|thumb|left|Provincial government headquarters in Cape Town]]
The provincial government is established under the [[Constitution of the Western Cape]], which was adopted in 1998. The people of the province elect the 42-member [[Western Cape Provincial Parliament]] every five years by a system of [[party-list proportional representation]]. The sixth provincial parliament was elected in [[2024 Western Cape provincial election|2024]]; 24 seats are held by the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]], 8 by the [[African National Congress]], 3 by the [[Patriotic Alliance]], 2 by the [[Economic Freedom Fighters]], and 1 each by the [[African Christian Democratic Party]], [[Good (political party)|Al Jama-ah]], [[Good (political party)|Good]], [[Freedom Front Plus]], and [[National Coloured Congress]]. The provincial parliament is responsible for legislating within its responsibilities as set out by the [[Constitution of South Africa|national constitution]]; these responsibilities include agriculture, education, environment, health services, housing, language policies, tourism, trade, and welfare.

The provincial parliament also elects the [[Premier of the Western Cape]] to lead the provincial executive. [[Alan Winde]], a member of the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|DA]] and former Provincial Minister of Community Safety, has served as Premier since the [[2019 Western Cape provincial election|2019 provincial election]]. The Premier appoints ten members of the provincial legislature to serve as a [[Executive Council of the Western Cape|cabinet]] of ministers, overseeing the departments of the [[Government of the Western Cape|provincial government]]. These departments are Agriculture, [[Western Cape Department of Community Safety|Community Safety]], Cultural Affairs and Sport, Economic Development and Tourism, [[Western Cape Education Department|Education]], Environmental Affairs and Development Planning, [[Western Cape Department of Health|Health]], Human Settlements, Local Government, Social Development, [[Western Cape Department of Transport and Public Works|Transport and Public Works]], and the Provincial Treasury.

Politically, the Western Cape is a stronghold for the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] (DA).  The DA has won an absolute majority of the vote in the province in every national, provincial, and municipal election since [[2009 South African general election|2009]].

==Municipalities==

The Western Cape has an excellent network of highways comparable with any first-world country. The primary highways are the [[N1 (South Africa)|N1]] (from Cape Town to [[Three Sisters, Northern Cape|Three Sisters]], continuing outside the province towards [[Bloemfontein]] and [[Johannesburg]]), [[N2 (South Africa)|N2]] (from Cape Town to Bloukrans River, towards [[Port Elizabeth]]), [[N7 (South Africa)|N7]] (from Cape Town to Bitterfontein, continuing towards [[Springbok, Northern Cape|Springbok]] and [[Namibia]]), [[N9 (South Africa)|N9]] (from George to Uniondale, continuing towards [[Graaff-Reinet]] and [[Colesberg, Northern Cape|Colesberg]]) and [[N12 (South Africa)|N12]] (from George to Three Sisters, continuing towards [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] and Johannesburg). Other routes are the "R" roads which connect the smaller towns. All major roads are tarred with major rural gravel roads well maintained. Limited access motorways are limited to the Cape Metropolitan Area, Winelands and Garden Route, however due to the low population density of the remainder of the province, the highways remain efficient and high-speed, except during peak holiday travel seasons, when travel can be slow-going in places due to heavy traffic. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}
