==History==
During the [[Edo period]], parts of the modern city of Chikusei were administered by [[Shimodate Domain]], one of the [[han system|feudal domains]] of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. With the creation of the modern municipalities system after the [[Meiji Restoration]] on April 1, 1889, the town of [[Shimodate, Ibaraki|Shimodate]] was established within [[Makabe District, Ibaraki]]). Shimodate was raised to city status on March 15, 1954.

The city of Chikusei was established on March 28, 2005, from the merger of the city of Shimodate, and towns of [[Akeno, Ibaraki|Akeno]], [[Kyōwa, Ibaraki|Kyōwa]] and [[Sekijō, Ibaraki|Sekijō]] (all from Makabe District).

==Government==
Chikusei has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 24 members. Chikusei contributes two members to the Ibaraki Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of [[Ibaraki 1st district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Chikusei has traditionally had  strong agricultural economy, with noted products including ''koshihikari'' rice, [[Pyrus pyrifolia|nashi pears]], small watermelons, cucumbers, strawberries, and tomatoes. Taking advantage of the location near the Tokyo metropolitan area and with abundant wide flat land, multiple [[industrial park]]s were created from the 1980s, forming a part of the Kanto inland industrial area. It is also within commuting range for to the cities of southern Tochigi Prefecture.
