'''Saxony''',{{efn|{{langx|de|Sachsen}} {{IPA|de|ˈzaksn̩||De-Sachsen.ogg}}; [[Upper Saxon German|Upper Saxon]]: ''Saggsn''; {{langx|hsb|Sakska}}}} officially the '''Free State of Saxony''',{{efn|{{langx|de|Freistaat Sachsen|links=no}} {{IPA|de|ˈfʁaɪʃtaːt ˈzaksn̩|}}; Upper Saxon: ''Freischdaad Saggsn''; {{langx|hsb|Swobodny stat Sakska|links=no}} {{IPA|hsb|ˈswɔbɔdnɨ ˈstat ˈsakska|}}}} is a landlocked [[state of Germany]], bordering the states of [[Brandenburg]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Thuringia]], and [[Bavaria]], as well as the countries of [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]]. Its capital is [[Dresden]], and its largest city is [[Leipzig]]. Saxony is the [[List of German states by area|tenth largest]] of Germany's sixteen states, with an area of {{convert|18413|km2|sqmi|0}}, and the [[List of German states by population|sixth most populous]], with more than 4 million inhabitants. 

The term [[Saxony (disambiguation)|Saxony]] has been in use for more than a millennium. It was used for the medieval [[Duchy of Saxony]], the [[Electorate of Saxony]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Saxony]], and twice for a republic. The first Free State of Saxony was established in 1918 as a constituent state of the [[Weimar Republic]]. After [[World War II]], it was under Soviet occupation before it became part of communist [[East Germany]] and was abolished by the government in 1952. Following [[German reunification]], the Free State of Saxony was reconstituted with enlarged borders in 1990 and became one of the five [[New states of Germany|new states]] of the Federal Republic of Germany.

The area of the modern state of Saxony should not be confused with [[Old Saxony]], the area inhabited by [[Saxons]]. Old Saxony corresponds roughly to the modern German states of [[Lower Saxony]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], and the Westphalian portion of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. Historically the region of Saxony has sometimes been referred to as Upper Saxony or Obersachsen in German to distinguish it from Lower Saxony.

The state is also home to a minority of [[Sorbs]], a [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] ethnic group native to the area, numbering an estimated 80,000 people.<ref name="gebel6353">{{Cite book |last=Gebel |first=K. |url=https://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/6353/1/Gebel-Language_and_ethnic_national_identity.pdf |title=Language and ethnic national identity in Europe: the importance of Gaelic and Sorbian to the maintenance of associated cultures and ethno cultural identities. |publisher=Middlesex University |year=2002 |location=London |access-date=13 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501090225/https://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/6353/1/Gebel-Language_and_ethnic_national_identity.pdf |archive-date=1 May 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Main|History of Saxony}}
Saxony has a long history as a [[duchy]], an [[Prince-elector|electorate]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (the [[Electorate of Saxony]]), and finally as a [[king]]dom (the [[Kingdom of Saxony]]). In 1918, after Germany's defeat in [[World War I]], its monarchy was overthrown and a republican form of government was established under the current name. The state was broken up into smaller units during communist rule (1949–1989), but was re-established on 3 October 1990 on the reunification of [[East Germany|East]] and [[West Germany]].

=== Prehistory ===
In prehistoric times, the territory of present-day Saxony was the site of some of the largest of the ancient central European [[Circular ditches|monumental temples]], dating from the fifth century BC. Notable archaeological sites have been discovered in Dresden and the villages of Eythra and [[Zwenkau]] near Leipzig. The [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] presence in the territory of today's Saxony is thought to have begun in the first century BC.

Parts of Saxony were possibly under the control of the Germanic King [[Marobod]] during the Roman era. By the late Roman period, several tribes known as the [[Saxons]] emerged, from which the subsequent state(s) draw their name. <!-- ''For the origins of the Saxon tribes, see [[Saxons]]''. -->

===Stem Duchy of Saxony===
{{Main|Old Saxony|Duchy of Saxony|Sorbian March}}

The territory of modern day Saxony and partly of Thuringia since the late 6th century became populated by [[Polabian Slavs]] (most prominently tribe of [[Sorbs (tribe)|Sorbs]]), being conquered by [[Francia]] which organized [[Sorbian March]].<ref>[[Sebastian Brather|Brather, Sebastian]] (2004).

The first medieval '''Duchy of Saxony''' was a late [[Early Middle Ages]] "[[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] [[stem duchy]]", which emerged around the start of the 8th century AD and grew to include the greater part of Northern [[Germany]], what are now the modern German states of [[Bremen]], [[Hamburg]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]] and [[Saxony-Anhalt]]. Saxons converted to Christianity during this period, with [[Charlemagne]] outlawing pagan practices.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Karras |first=Ruth Mazo |date=1986 |title=Pagan Survivals and Syncretism in the Conversion of Saxony |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25022405 |journal=The Catholic Historical Review |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=553–572 |jstor=25022405 |issn=0008-8080}}</ref> This geographical region is unrelated to present-day Saxony but the name moved southwards due to certain historical events (see below).

===Holy Roman Empire===
{{Main article|Electorate of Saxony}}
The territory of the Free State of Saxony became part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] by the 10th century, when the dukes of Saxony were also kings (or emperors) of the Holy Roman Empire, comprising the [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]], or Saxon, dynasty. The [[Margravate of Meissen]] was founded in 985 as a [[frontier march]], that soon extended to the [[Kwisa]] (Queis) river to the east and as far as the Ore Mountains. In the process of {{Lang|de|[[Ostsiedlung]]}}, settlement of German farmers in the sparsely populated area was promoted. Around this time, the [[Billung]]s, a [[Saxons|Saxon]] noble family, received extensive lands in Saxony. The emperor eventually gave them the title of [[List of rulers of Saxony|dukes of Saxony]]. After [[Magnus, Duke of Saxony|Duke Magnus]] died in 1106, causing the extinction of the male line of Billungs, oversight of the duchy was given to [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothar of Supplinburg]], who also became emperor for a short time.

In 1137, control of Saxony passed to the [[House of Welf|Guelph]] dynasty, descendants of Wulfhild Billung, eldest daughter of the last Billung duke, and the daughter of Lothar of Supplinburg. In 1180 large portions west of the Weser were ceded to the [[Electorate of Cologne|Bishops of Cologne]], while some central parts between the Weser and the Elbe remained with the Guelphs, becoming later the Duchy of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]]. The remaining eastern lands, together with the title of Duke of Saxony, passed to an [[House of Ascania|Ascanian]] dynasty (descended from [[Eilika of Saxony|Eilika Billung]], Wulfhild's younger sister) and were divided in 1260 into the two small states of [[Saxe-Lauenburg]] and [[Saxe-Wittenberg]]. The former state was also named ''[[Lower Saxony]]'', the latter ''[[Upper Saxony]]'', thence the later names of the two [[Imperial Circle]]s Saxe-Lauenburg and Saxe-Wittenberg. Both claimed the Saxon [[prince-elector|electoral privilege]] for themselves, but the [[Golden Bull of 1356]] accepted only Wittenberg's claim, with Lauenburg nevertheless continuing to maintain its claim. In 1422, when the Saxon electoral line of the Ascanians became extinct, the Ascanian [[Eric V of Saxe-Lauenburg]] tried to reunite the Saxon duchies.

However, [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], [[King of the Romans]], had already granted Margrave [[Frederick the Warlike|Frederick IV the Warlike]] of [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]] ([[House of Wettin]]) an expectancy of the Saxon electorate in order to remunerate his military support. On 1 August 1425 Sigismund enfeoffed the Wettinian Frederick as Prince-Elector of Saxony, despite the protests of Eric V. Thus the Saxon territories remained permanently separated.

The [[Electorate of Saxony]] was then merged with the much larger Wettinian [[Margraviate of Meissen]]; however, it used the higher-ranking title Electorate of Saxony and even the Ascanian coat-of-arms for the entire monarchy.<ref>The Ascanian coat-of-arms shows the Ascanian [[Barry (heraldry)#Barry, Paly, Bendy|barry]] of ten, in [[Sable (heraldry)|sable]] and [[Or (heraldry)|or]], covered by a crancelin of rhombs bendwise in [[Vert (heraldry)|vert]].</ref> Thus Saxony came to include [[Dresden]] and [[Meissen]]. Hence, the territory of the modern Free State of Saxony shares the name with the old Saxon stem duchy for historical and dynastic reasons rather than any significant ethnic, linguistic or cultural connection. In the 18th and 19th centuries Saxe-Lauenburg was colloquially called the [[Duchy of Lauenburg]], which was held in a personal union by the [[Electorate of Hanover]] from the 18th century to the Napoleonic wars, and in a personal union with Denmark (along with neighbouring [[Holstein]] and [[Schleswig]]) for much the 19th century. In 1876 it was absorbed into [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] as the [[Herzogtum Lauenburg|Duchy of Lauenburg district]] of the [[Province of Schleswig-Holstein]]).

=== Foundation of the second Saxon state ===
[[File:Locator Electoral Saxony within the Holy Roman Empire (1618).svg|right|thumb|The [[Electorate of Saxony]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (1618)]]
Saxe-Wittenberg, mostly in modern [[Saxony-Anhalt]], became subject to the [[margravate of Meissen]], ruled by the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] dynasty in 1423. This established a new and powerful state, occupying large portions of the present Free State of Saxony, Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and Bavaria (Coburg and its environs). Although the centre of this state was far to the southeast of the former Saxony, it came to be referred to as '''Upper Saxony''' and then simply '''Saxony''', while the former Saxon territories in the north were now known as '''Lower Saxony''' (the modern term [[Niedersachsen]] deriving from this).

In 1485, Saxony was split in the [[Treaty of Leipzig]]. A collateral line of the Wettin princes received what later became [[Thuringia]] and founded several small states there (see ''[[Ernestine duchies]]''). Since these princes were allowed to use the Saxon coat of arms, in many towns of Thuringia, the coat of arms can still be found in historical buildings.

The remaining Saxon state became still more powerful, receiving [[Upper Lusatia|Upper]] and [[Lower Lusatia]] in the [[Peace of Prague (1635)]]. It also became known in the 18th century for its cultural achievements, although it was politically weaker than [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and [[Habsburg monarchy|Austria]], states which oppressed Saxony from the north and south, respectively.

Between 1697 and 1763, two successive [[Electors of Saxony]] were also elected [[Kings of Poland]] in [[Personal union of Poland and Saxony|personal union]]. Many landmarks in Saxony date from this period and contain remnants of the former close Polish-Saxon relation, such as the [[coat of arms of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] on the facades and in the interiors of palaces, churches, edifices, etc. (e.g. [[Zwinger (Dresden)|Zwinger]], [[Dresden Cathedral]], [[Moritzburg Castle]]), and on numerous mileposts, and the close political and cultural relationship persisted well into the 19th century, with Saxony being the place of preparations for the Polish [[Kościuszko Uprising]] against the [[Partitions of Poland|partitioning]] powers,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dzieje.pl/aktualnosci/rocznica-insurekcji-kosciuszkowskiej|title=Insurekcja Kościuszkowska - ostatnia próba ratowania Rzeczpospolitej|website=Dzieje.pl|access-date=22 June 2024|language=pl}}</ref> and one of the chief destinations for Polish refugees from partitioned Poland, including the artistic and political elite, such as composer [[Frédéric Chopin]], war hero [[Józef Bem]] and writer [[Adam Mickiewicz]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Sadowski|first=Aleksander Marek|year=2022|title=Sachsen und Polen – Tausend Jahre Nachbarschaft / Polska i Saksonia – tysiąc lat sąsiedztwa|magazine=Polonus|language=de,pl|location=Ostritz|issue=5|page=39|issn=2701-6285}}</ref>

In 1756, Saxony joined a coalition of Austria, [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] against Prussia. [[Frederick II of Prussia]] chose to attack preemptively and invaded Saxony in August 1756, precipitating the [[Third Silesian War]] (part of the [[Seven Years' War]]). The Prussians quickly defeated Saxony and incorporated the [[Royal Saxon Army|Saxon army]] into the [[Prussian Army]]. At the end of the Seven Years' War, Saxony recovered its independence in the 1763 [[Treaty of Hubertusburg]].

===19th century===
[[File:Map-saxony1900.png|right|thumb|The Kingdom of Saxony after the [[Congress of Vienna]]]]
{{further|Kingdom of Saxony}}
In 1806, French Emperor [[Napoleon]] abolished the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and established the Electorate of Saxony as a kingdom in exchange for military support. The [[Prince-elector|Elector]] Frederick Augustus III accordingly became King [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony]]. Frederick Augustus remained loyal to Napoleon during the wars that swept Europe in the following years; he was taken prisoner and his territories were declared forfeit by the allies in 1813, after the defeat of Napoleon. Prussia intended the annexation of Saxony but the opposition of [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], France, and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] to this plan resulted in the restoration of Frederick Augustus to his throne at the [[Congress of Vienna]] although he was forced to cede the northern part of the kingdom to Prussia, which led to the loss of nearly 60% of the Saxon territory,<ref>{{harvp|Pollock|Thomas|1952|p=486}}</ref> and 40% of its population. Most of these lands were merged with the [[Duchy of Magdeburg]], the [[Altmark]] and some smaller territories to become the Prussian [[Province of Saxony]], a predecessor of the modern state of [[Saxony-Anhalt]]. [[Lower Lusatia]] and part of the former Saxe-Wittenberg territory became part of the [[Province of Brandenburg]] and the northeastern part of [[Upper Lusatia]] became part of the [[Province of Silesia]]. The [[rump state|rump]] Kingdom of Saxony had roughly the same extent as the present state, albeit slightly smaller.
[[File:G5241.jpg|thumb|Saxony before the Congress of Vienna compared to present day Saxony]]

Meanwhile, in 1815, the Kingdom of Saxony joined the [[German Confederation]].<ref name="p510">{{harvp|Pollock|Thomas|1952|p=510}}</ref> In the politics of the Confederation, Saxony was overshadowed by Prussia and Austria. King [[Anthony of Saxony]] came to the throne of Saxony in 1827. Shortly thereafter, liberal pressures in Saxony mounted and broke out in revolt during 1830—a [[Revolutions of 1830|year of revolution]] in Europe.<ref name=p510/> The revolution in Saxony resulted in a constitution for the Kingdom of Saxony that served as the basis for its government until 1918.<ref name=p510/>

During the [[German revolutions of 1848–1849|1848–49 constitutionalist revolutions in Germany]], Saxony became a hotbed of revolutionaries, with anarchists such as [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and democrats including [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Gottfried Semper]] taking part in the [[May Uprising in Dresden]] in 1849. (Scenes of Richard Wagner's participation in the May 1849 uprising in Dresden are depicted in the 1983 movie ''[[Wagner&nbsp;(film)|Wagner]]'' starring [[Richard Burton]] as Richard Wagner.) The May uprising in Dresden forced King [[Frederick Augustus II of Saxony]] to concede further reforms to the Saxon government.<ref name=p510/>

In 1854 Frederick Augustus II's brother, King [[John, King of Saxony|John of Saxony]], succeeded to the throne. A scholar, King John translated [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]].<ref name=p510/> King John followed a federalistic and pro-Austrian policy throughout the early 1860s until the outbreak of the [[Austro-Prussian War]]. During that war, Prussian troops overran Saxony without resistance and then invaded Austrian [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]].<ref>{{harvp|Pollock|Thomas|1952|pp=510–511}}</ref> After the war, Saxony was forced to pay an indemnity and to join the [[North German Confederation]] in 1867.<ref name="p511">{{harvp|Pollock|Thomas|1952|p=511}}</ref> Under the terms of the North German Confederation, Prussia took over control of the Saxon postal system, railroads, military and foreign affairs.<ref name=p511/> In the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, Saxon troops fought together with Prussian and other German troops against France.<ref name=p511/> In 1871, Saxony joined the newly formed [[German Empire]].<ref name=p511/>

===20th century===
[[File:Sasko1950.png|right|thumb|The Free State of Saxony 1945–1952]]
After King [[Frederick Augustus III of Saxony]] abdicated on 13 November 1918, Saxony, remaining a constituent state of Germany ([[Weimar Republic]]), became the Free State of Saxony under a new constitution enacted on 1 November 1920. In October 1923, when the [[Communist Party of Germany]] entered the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic]]-led government in Dresden with [[German October|hidden revolutionary intentions]], the Reich government under Chancellor [[Gustav Stresemann]] used a ''[[Reichsexekution]]'' to send troops into Saxony to remove the Communists from the government.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sturm |first=Reinhard |date=23 December 2011 |title=Kampf um die Republik 1919–1923 |trans-title=Battle for the Republic 1919–1923 |url=https://www.bpb.de/themen/nationalsozialismus-zweiter-weltkrieg/dossier-nationalsozialismus/39531/kampf-um-die-republik-1919-1923/?p=all#node-content-title-21 |access-date=6 May 2023 |website=Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung |language=de}}</ref> The state retained its name and borders during the Nazi era as a {{lang|de|[[Administrative divisions of Nazi Germany|Gau]]}} ([[Gau Saxony]]), but lost its quasi-autonomous status and its parliamentary democracy.

During [[World War II]], under the secret Nazi programme ''[[Aktion T4]]'', an estimated 15,000 people suffering from mental and physical disabilities, as well as a number of concentration camp inmates, were murdered at [[Sonnenstein Euthanasia Centre|Sonnenstein killing centre]] near [[Pirna]]. Numerous subcamps of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]], [[Flossenburg concentration camp|Flossenburg]] and [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp|Gross-Rosen]] concentration camps were operated in Saxony.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aussenlager-buchenwald.de/|title=Buchenwald war überall|website=aussenlager-buchenwald.de|access-date=22 June 2024|language=de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gedenkstaette-flossenbuerg.de/en/history/subcamps|title=Subcamps|website=KZ-Gedenkstätte Flossenbürg|access-date=22 June 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.gross-rosen.eu/historia-kl-gross-rosen/filie-obozu-gross-rosen/|title=Subcamps of KL Gross-Rosen|website=Gross-Rosen Museum in Rogoźnica|access-date=22 June 2024}}</ref>

As the war drew to its end, U.S. troops under General [[George Patton]] occupied the western part of Saxony in April 1945, while [[Soviet occupation zone in Germany|Soviet troops occupied]] the eastern part. That summer, the entire state was handed over to Soviet forces as agreed in the [[London Protocol (1944)|London Protocol of September 1944]]. Britain, the US, and the USSR then negotiated Germany's future at the [[Potsdam Conference]]. Under the [[Potsdam Agreement]], all German territory East of the [[Oder-Neisse line]] was annexed by Poland and the Soviet Union, and, unlike in the aftermath of [[World War I]], the annexing powers were allowed to expel the inhabitants. During the following three years, [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|Poland]] and [[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia expelled]] German-speaking people from their territories, and some of these expellees came to Saxony. Only a small area of Saxony lying east of the [[Neisse]] River and centred around the town of [[Bogatynia|Reichenau]] (Bogatynia) was annexed by Poland. Traditional close relations of Saxony with neighbouring German-speaking [[Egerland]] were thus completely destroyed, making the border of Saxony along the [[Ore Mountains]] a linguistic border.

Part of the former [[Free State of Prussia (1918-1933)|Prussian]] [[province of Lower Silesia]] lay west of the [[Oder-Neisse line]] and therefore was separated from the bulk of its former province; the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany]] (SVAG) merged this territory into Saxony.<ref>Kosiński, Leszek (1960) [http://rcin.org.pl/Content/33932/WA51_50482_r1960-z2_Dokumentacja-Geogr.pdf <nowiki>"Pochodzenie terytorialne ludności Ziem Zachodnich w 1950 r.

Warsaw: PAN (Polish Academy of Sciences), Institute of Geography. 2: Tabela 1 (data by county) – via Repozytorium Cyfrowe Instytutów Naukowych.</ref> This former Silesian territory broadly corresponded with the Upper Lusatian territory annexed by Prussia in 1815.

On [[1946 Soviet occupation zone state elections|20 October 1946, SVAG organised elections for the Saxon state parliament]] ({{lang|de|Landtag}}), but many people were arbitrarily excluded from candidacy and suffrage, and the Soviet Union openly supported the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED). The new minister-president [[Rudolf Friedrichs]] (SED), had been a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] until April 1946. He met his Bavarian counterparts in the U.S. zone of occupation in October 1946 and May 1947, but died suddenly in mysterious circumstances the following month. He was succeeded by [[Max Seydewitz]], a loyal follower of [[Joseph Stalin]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany), including Saxony, was established in 1949 out of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] zone of [[Occupied Germany]], becoming a [[State socialism|constitutionally socialist state]], part of [[COMECON]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]], under the leadership of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]]. In 1952 the government abolished the Free State of Saxony, and divided its territory into three {{lang|de|[[Administrative divisions of the German Democratic Republic#Division into Bezirke|Bezirke]]}}: [[Leipzig (Bezirk)|Leipzig]], [[Dresden (Bezirk)|Dresden]], and [[Karl-Marx-Stadt (Bezirk)|Karl-Marx-Stadt]] (formerly and currently [[Chemnitz]]). Areas around [[Hoyerswerda]] were also part of the [[Cottbus (Bezirk)|Cottbus Bezirk]].

The Free State of Saxony was reconstituted with slightly altered borders in 1990, following [[German reunification]]. Besides the formerly Silesian area of Saxony, which was mostly included in the territory of the new Saxony, the free state gained further areas north of [[Leipzig]] that had belonged to [[Saxony-Anhalt]] until 1952.

=== 2024 European Parliament Election ===
In the [[2024 European Parliament election]], [[Alternative for Germany|AfD]] received the highest percentage of votes in Saxony, winning 31.8% of the ballots. The other states where AfD has become the strongest party are [[Thuringia]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], and [[Brandenburg]]. These four states were part of [[East Germany]] like Saxony. Compared to the last election, AfD increased their votes in Saxony which was 25.3% in the [[2019 European Parliament election]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Far-right AfD becomes strongest party in eastern German states |url=https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/far-right-afd-becomes-strongest-party-in-eastern-german-states/3245649 |access-date=2024-07-09 |website=www.aa.com.tr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Ergebnisse - Die Bundeswahlleiterin |url=https://www.bundeswahlleiterin.de/europawahlen/2024/ergebnisse.html |access-date=2024-07-09 |website=www.bundeswahlleiterin.de}}</ref>

[[CDU/CSU]] received 21.8% of the votes in Saxony and became the second strongest party in the 2024 EP election. [[Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht|BSW]] was in the third place by receiving 12.6% of the votes. [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] lost a significant proportion of their votes compared to the 2019 election. Their votes regressed from 11.7% to 4.9%.<ref>{{Cite web |title=European Parliament election 2019 - The Federal Returning Officer |url=https://www.bundeswahlleiterin.de/en/europawahlen/2019.html |access-date=2024-07-09 |website=www.bundeswahlleiterin.de}}</ref>

==== Federal politics ====
Saxony has 16 [[Electoral district|constituencies]] for the [[Bundestag]].
{{Electoral districts of Saxony}}

=== Administration ===
Saxony is divided into 10 districts:

In addition, three cities have the status of an [[Urban districts of Germany|urban district]] ({{langx|de|kreisfreie Städte}}):
# [[Chemnitz]] (C)
# [[Dresden]] (DD)
# [[Leipzig]] (L)

Between 1990 and 2008, Saxony was divided into the three regions (''Regierungsbezirke'') of [[Chemnitz (region)|Chemnitz]], [[Dresden (region)|Dresden]], and [[Leipzig (region)|Leipzig]]. After the [[2008 Saxony district reform]], these regions –  with some alterations of their respective areas –  were called ''Direktionsbezirke''. In 2012, the authorities of these regions were merged into one central authority, the ''{{Interlanguage link|Landesdirektion Sachsen|de}}''.

== Demographics ==

=== Population change ===
Saxony is a densely populated state if compared with more rural German states such as [[Bavaria]] or [[Lower Saxony]]. However, the population has declined over time. The population of Saxony began declining in the 1950s due to emigration, a process which accelerated after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989. After bottoming out in 2013, the population has stabilized due to increased immigration and higher fertility rates. The cities of Leipzig, Dresden and Chemnitz, and the towns of Radebeul and Markkleeberg in their vicinity, have seen their populations increase since 2000. The following tables illustrate the foreign resident populations and the population of Saxony from 1816 to 2022:

Saxony is home to the [[Sorbs]]. There are currently between 45,000 and 60,000 Sorbs living in Saxony (Upper Lusatia region).<ref>Jana Šołćina, Edward Wornar: ''Obersorbisch im Selbststudium, Hornjoserbšćina za samostudij''.

Many geographic names in Saxony are of Sorbic origin (including the three largest cities [[Chemnitz]], [[Dresden]] and [[Leipzig]]). The Sorbic language and culture are protected by special laws and cities and villages in eastern Saxony that are inhabited by a significant number of Sorbian inhabitants have bilingual street signs and administrative offices provide service in both, German and Sorbian. The Sorbs enjoy cultural self-administration which is exercised through the [[Domowina]]. Former [[Minister president (Germany)|Minister President]] [[Stanislaw Tillich]] is of Sorbian ancestry and has been the first leader of a German state from a national minority.

As of 2011, 72.6% of people are not affiliated with any religion. The [[Protestant Church in Germany]] represents the largest [[Christian]] denomination in the state, adhered to by 21.4% of the population. Members of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] formed a minority of 3.8%. About 0.9% of the Saxons belonged to an Evangelical [[free church]] (''Evangelische Freikirche'', i.e. various Protestants outside the EKD), 0.3% to Orthodox churches and 1% to other religious communities, while 72.6% did not belong to any public-law religious society.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ergebnisse.zensus2011.de/?locale=en#StaticContent:14,BEG_4_2_6,m,table|title=Zensusdatenbank|website=Ergebnisse.zensus2011.de|date=2 December 2021|access-date=7 March 2015|archive-date=10 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110002707/https://ergebnisse.zensus2011.de/?locale=en#StaticContent:14,BEG_4_2_6,m,table|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[Moravian Church]] (see above) still maintains its religious centre in Herrnhut and it is there where 'The [[Daily Watchwords]]' (Losungen) are selected each year which are in use in many churches worldwide. In particular in the larger cities, there are numerous smaller religious communities. The international [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has a presence in the [[Freiberg Germany Temple]] which was the first of its kind in Germany, opened in 1985 even before its counterpart in Western Germany.

Microchip-makers near Dresden have given the region the nickname "[[Silicon Saxony]]". The publishing and porcelain industries of the region are well known, although their contributions to the regional economy are no longer significant. Today, the automobile industry, machinery production, and services mainly contribute to the economic development of the region.

Saxony reported an average unemployment of 5.5% in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/2522/umfrage/entwicklung-der-arbeitslosenquote-in-sachsen-seit-1999/|title=Arbeitslosenquote* in Sachsen von 1999 bis 2019|website=Statista|access-date=2 February 2020}}</ref>

The Leipzig area, which until recently was among the regions with the highest unemployment rate, could benefit greatly from investments by [[Porsche]] and [[BMW]]. With the [[VW Phaeton]] factory in Dresden, and many parts suppliers, the automobile industry has again become one of the pillars of Saxon industry, as it was in the early 20th century. [[Zwickau]] is another major Volkswagen location. [[Freiberg]], a former mining town, has emerged as a foremost location for solar technology. Dresden and some other regions of Saxony play a leading role in some areas of international biotechnology, such as electronic bioengineering. While these high-technology sectors do not yet offer a large number of jobs, they have stopped or even reversed the [[brain drain]] that was occurring until the early 2000s in many parts of Saxony.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Emmanuel |first=Ojukwu |date=2022-07-06 |title=Nigeria Tech Talent Shortage - How Brain Drain Is Threatening Recruitment |url=https://www.tekedia.com/nigeria-tech-talent-shortage-how-brain-drain-is-threatening-recruitment/ |access-date=2023-06-08 |website=Tekedia |language=en-US}}</ref> Regional universities have strengthened their positions by partnering with local industries.

=== International trade ===
Saxony is a strongly export-oriented economy. In 2018, exports amounted to 40.48 billion euros while imports stood at 24.41 billion euros. The largest export partner of Saxony is [[China]] with an amount of 6.72 billion euros, while the second largest export market are the United States with 3.59 billion.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Saechsisches Landesamt fuer Statistik (Saxon Statistics Authority) |title=Sachsens Exportpartner 2020 (insgesamt €36,79 Mrd.) |url=https://standort-sachsen.de/de/exporteure/sachsens-aussenhandel|access-date=7 June 2019}}</ref> The largest exporting sectors are the automobile industry and mechanical engineering.

== Education ==
Saxony's school system belongs to the most excelling ones in Germany. It has been ranked first in the German school assessment ([https://www.insm-bildungsmonitor.de Bildungsmonitor]) for several years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.schule.sachsen.de/error404.html|title=Fehler 404 – sachsen.de|first=Staatsministerium für|last=Kultus|website=www.schule.sachsen.de}}</ref>

Saxony has four large universities, six {{lang|de|Fachhochschulen}} (Universities of Applied Sciences) and six [[art school]]s.

[[File:TU-Dresden-Georg-Schumann-Bau.jpg|thumb|right|[[TU Dresden]] is the largest university in Saxony.]]
The [[Dresden University of Technology]] (TU Dresden), founded in 1828, is one of Germany's oldest universities. With 36,066 students as of 2010, it is the largest [[university]] in Saxony and one of the ten largest universities in Germany. It is a member of [[TU9]], a consortium of nine leading German Institutes of Technology.

[[Leipzig University]] is one of the oldest universities in the world and the [[List of universities in Germany#Universities by date of establishment|second-oldest]] university (by consecutive years of existence) in Germany, founded in 1409. Famous alumni include [[Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Leopold von Ranke|Ranke]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Cai Yuanpei]], [[Angela Merkel]], [[Raila Odinga]], [[Tycho Brahe]], and nine Nobel laureates are associated with this university.

With over 11,000 students, the [[Chemnitz University of Technology]] is the third largest university in Saxony.

Established in 1765, the [[Freiberg University of Mining and Technology]], located in the former mining town of [[Freiberg]], is the oldest university of mining and metallurgy in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://tu-freiberg.de/en/university/profiles/history |title=From the history of the TU Bergakademie Freiberg |website=tu-freiberg.de |access-date=2020-09-25 |archive-date=12 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200812092534/https://tu-freiberg.de/en/university/profiles/history |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Saxony is home to several [[Max Planck Institutes]] and research institutions of the [[Fraunhofer Society]].

One of the two main campuses of the [[German National Library]] is located in Leipzig.

== Culture ==

Saxony is part of [[Central Germany (cultural area)|Central Germany]] as a cultural area. As such, throughout German history it played an important role in shaping [[German culture]].

=== Languages ===
[[File:Budyšin – měšćanska tafla (2021).jpg|thumb|Boundary sign of [[Bautzen]] / Budyšin in [[German language|German]] and [[Upper Sorbian language|Upper Sorbian]]. Many place names in eastern Saxony are derived from Sorbian.]]

The most common [[patois]] spoken in Saxony are combined in the group of "[[Thuringian dialect|Thuringian]] and [[Upper Saxon German|Upper Saxon dialects]]". Due to the inexact use of the term "Saxon dialects" in colloquial language, the Upper Saxon attribute has been added to distinguish it from [[Old Saxon]] and [[Low German|Low Saxon]]. Other German dialects spoken in Saxony are the dialects of the [[Ore Mountains]], which have been affected by Upper Saxon dialects, and the dialects of the Vogtland, which are more affected by the [[East Franconian German|East Franconian]] languages.

[[Upper Sorbian language|Upper Sorbian]] (a [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic language]]) is spoken in the parts of [[Upper Lusatia]] that are inhabited by the Sorbian minority. The Germans in Upper Lusatia speak distinct dialects of their own (Lusatian dialects).

=== Motherland of the Reformation ===
Saxony is often seen as the ''[[motherland]] of the [[Reformation]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.sachsen-tourismus.de/en/travel-topics/art-culture/motherland-of-the-reformation/ |title=Motherland of the Reformation |website=sachsen-tourismus.de |access-date=2020-05-31}}</ref> It was predominantly [[Lutheran]] [[Protestant]] from the [[Reformation]] until the late 20th century.

The [[Electoral Saxony]], a predecessor of today's Saxony, was the original birthplace of the Reformation. The [[Electors of Saxony|elector]] was Lutheran starting in 1525. The Lutheran church was organized through the late 1510s and the early 1520s. It was [[State religion|officially established]] in 1527 by [[John, Elector of Saxony|John the Steadfast]]. Although some of the sites associated with [[Martin Luther]] also lie in the current state of Saxony-Anhalt (including [[Wittenberg]], [[Eisleben]] and [[Mansfeld]]), today's Saxony is usually viewed as the formal successor to what used to be Luther's country back in the 16th century (i.e. the Electoral Saxony).

Martin Luther personally oversaw the Lutheran church in Saxony and shaped it consistently with [[Theology of Martin Luther|his own views and ideas]]. The 16th, 17th and 18th centuries were heavily dominated by [[Lutheran orthodoxy]]. In addition, the [[Reformed faith]] made inroads with the so-called [[Crypto-Calvinism|crypto Calvinists]], but was strongly persecuted in an overwhelmingly Lutheran state. In the 17th century, [[Pietism]] became an important influence. In the 18th century, the [[Moravian Church]] was set up on [[Count von Zinzendorf]]'s property at [[Herrnhut]]. From 1525, the rulers were traditionally Lutheran and widely acknowledged as [[defender of the faith|defenders of the Protestant faith]], although – beginning with [[Augustus II the Strong]], who was required to convert to Roman Catholicism in 1697 in order to become King of Poland – its monarchs were exclusively Roman Catholic. That meant Augustus and the subsequent Electors of Saxony, who were Roman Catholic, ruled over a state with an almost entirely Protestant population.

In 1925, 90.3% of the Saxon population was Protestant, 3.6% was Roman Catholic, 0.4% was Jewish and 5.7% was placed in other religious categories.<ref>Grundriss der Statistik. II. Gesellschaftsstatistik by Wilhelm Winkler, p. 36</ref>

After World War II, Saxony was incorporated into East Germany which pursued a policy of [[state atheism]]. After 45 years of Communist rule, the majority of the population has become unaffiliated. Nonetheless, even during this time Saxony remained an important place of religious dialogue and it was at [[Meissen]] where the agreement on mutual recognition between the German Evangelical Church and the [[Church of England]] was signed in 1988.<ref>[https://www.churchofengland.org/media/3320&ved=2ahUKEwjUh6uiztfpAhWKFMAKHbW8DpYQFjACegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw1xmR136YlRRPfMCxfjH_cG]{{dead link|date=August 2021}}</ref>

===Sports===
[[File:Red Bull Arena Panorama cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Red Bull Arena (Leipzig)|Red Bull Arena]] in [[Leipzig]]]]
In 2020, there were 4,447 registered sports clubs of various disciplines with over 600,000 members in Saxony.<ref>{{Cite web|last=E-Mail|first=Annegret Müller Referentin Öffentlichkeitsarbeit / Pressesprecherin +49 341 21631-14|title=Pressemitteilungen|url=https://www.sport-fuer-sachsen.de/de/presse/pressemitteilungen/?tx_ifabprins_pressmanagement%5Bid%5D=654&tx_ifabprins_pressmanagement%5Baction%5D=show&tx_ifabprins_pressmanagement%5Bcontroller%5D=PressManagement&cHash=0cd8f0d3dda23366d10ae368459b0d50|access-date=2021-05-25|website=Landessportbund Sachsen|language=de|archive-date=10 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200710223203/https://www.sport-fuer-sachsen.de/de/presse/pressemitteilungen/?tx_ifabprins_pressmanagement%5Bid%5D=654&tx_ifabprins_pressmanagement%5Baction%5D=show&tx_ifabprins_pressmanagement%5Bcontroller%5D=PressManagement&cHash=0cd8f0d3dda23366d10ae368459b0d50|url-status=dead}}</ref> The most popular sport in Saxony is [[association football|football]]. With [[RB Leipzig]] there is one Saxon team playing in the [[Bundesliga]] as well as the European [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. Leipzig is notable for a longstanding football tradition, a Leipzig [[1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig|team]] having been the first national football champion in German history. Another popular sport is [[handball]] with [[SC DHfK Leipzig Handball|SC DHfK Leipzig]] playing in the [[Handball-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]]. On a local level sports such as [[table tennis]], [[cycling]], [[mountaineering]] and [[volleyball]] are popular.

====Rock climbing====
{{see also|Saxon Switzerland climbing region}}
Saxony prides itself to have been one of the first places in the world where modern recreational rock climbing was developed. [[Falkenstein (Saxon Switzerland)|Falkenstein]] rock in the area of [[Bad Schandau]] is considered to be the place were the German rock climbing tradition started in 1864.

====Winter sports====
The Ore Mountains in southern Saxony are traditionally a region of winter sports. The ski ressort of [[Oberwiesenthal]] is the highest town of Germany, at an altitude of 900 m, though the surrounding mountains do not reach the same height as in the alpine areas of [[Southern Germany]]. Thus, climate change is posing a certain threat to the development of winter sports business. There are a number of training facilities for the German Winter Olympics' team in the region.

===Art===
[[Image:Dresdner Grüner Diamant - Neues Grünes Gewölbe Dresden.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The 'Dresden Green Diamond' – the largest natural green diamond – is part of the collection of the [[Green Vault]].]]
The two major cultural centers of Saxony are [[Dresden]] and [[Leipzig]]. The two cities have each a unique character which is reflecting the role they played throughout Saxon and German history, Dresden being a political center while Leipzig has been a major trading city. Thus, Dresden is well known for the art collections of the former Saxon kings ([[Dresden State Art Collections]] with the [[Green Vault]] and [[Zwinger (Dresden)|Zwinger]] as the most well-known parts).

Leipzig on the other hand never had a royal court, so its culture is borne largely by its citizens. The city is famous for its relationship with classical music and names like [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Mendelssohn]] or [[Wagner]] are linked to it. Over the past decades the city became famous for its modern art scene, most notably the Neue Leipziger Schule ([[New Leipzig School]]) with artists such as [[Neo Rauch]].

===Porcelain===
Saxony was the first place in Europe to develop and produce white [[porcelain]], a luxury good until then imported only from China. The [[Meissen Porcelain]] manufactory has been producing porcelain since 1710. It is one of the world's leading porcelain manufacturers and one of the oldest and most internationally known German luxury brands.<ref>Florian Langenscheidt, [[Bernd Venohr]] (Hrsg.): ''Lexikon der deutschen Weltmarktführer. Die Königsklasse deutscher Unternehmen in Wort und Bild''. Deutsche Standards Editionen, Köln 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-86936-221-2}}.</ref>

===Cuisine===
{{main|Saxon cuisine}}
Saxon cuisine encompasses regional cooking traditions of Saxony. In general the cuisine is very hearty and features many peculiarities of Mid-Germany such as a great variety of [[sauce]]s which accompany the [[main dish]] and the fashion to serve potato dumplings (Klöße/[[Knödel]]) as a [[side dish]] instead of [[potato]]es, [[pasta]] or [[rice]]. Also much [[freshwater fish]] is used in Saxon cuisine. The area around Dresden is home to the easternmost wine region in Germany (see: [[Saxony (wine region)]]).

===Anthem===
Saxony (as other German states) has its own anthem, dating back to the monarchy of the 19th century. 'Gott segne Sachsenland' (God save Saxony) is based on the melody of [[God save the King]].
