Nuremberg sits on the [[Pegnitz (river)|Pegnitz]], which carries the name [[Regnitz]] from its confluence with the [[Rednitz]] in [[Fürth]] onwards ({{pPegnitz}}), and on the [[Rhine–Main–Danube Canal]], that connects the [[North Sea]] to the [[Black Sea]]. Lying in the Bavarian [[Regierungsbezirk|administrative region]] of [[Middle Franconia]], it is the largest city and unofficial capital of the entire cultural region of [[Franconia]]. The city is surrounded on three sides by the Reichswald ([[:de:Nürnberger Reichswald|de]]), a large forest, and in the north lies Knoblauchsland (''garlic land'') ([[:de:Knoblauchsland|de]]), an extensive vegetable growing area and cultural landscape.

The city forms a continuous conurbation with the neighbouring cities of [[Fürth]], [[Erlangen]] and [[Schwabach]], which is the heart of an urban area region with around 1.4&nbsp;million inhabitants,<ref>[https://hey.bayern/region/nuernberg Region Nürnberg] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220704125051/https://hey.bayern/region/nuernberg |date=4 July 2022 }} on hey.bayern</ref> while the larger [[Nuremberg Metropolitan Region]] has a population of approximately 3.6 million. It is the largest city in the [[East Franconian]] dialect area (colloquially: "Franconian"; {{langx|de|link=no|Fränkisch}}).

Nuremberg and [[Fürth]] were once connected by the [[Bavarian Ludwig Railway]], the [[List of the first German railways to 1870|first steam-hauled and overall second railway opened in Germany]] (1835). Today, the U1 of the [[Nuremberg Subway]] runs along this route. Subway lines U2 and U3 are the first German driverless subway lines, automatically moving railcars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.br.de/nachrichten/bayern/vag-15-jahre-automatische-u-bahn-nuernberg-ein-erfolgs-projekt,Th9t7c9|language=de|title=VAG: 15 years of the automatic Nuremberg subway – a successful project|date=2023-06-14|access-date=2024-03-25|archive-date=24 March 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240324073423/https://www.br.de/nachrichten/bayern/vag-15-jahre-automatische-u-bahn-nuernberg-ein-erfolgs-projekt,Th9t7c9|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Nuremberg Airport]] ({{lang|de|Flughafen Nürnberg "Albrecht Dürer"}}) is the second-busiest airport in Bavaria after [[Munich Airport]], and the tenth-busiest airport in the country.

===Middle Ages===
{{see also|Burgraviate of Nuremberg|Imperial City of Nuremberg}}
[[File:Nuremberg defensive wall north f burggarten bastion f w.jpg|thumb|left|Old fortifications of Nuremberg]]

The first documentary mention of the city, in 1050, mentions Nuremberg as the location of an [[imperial castle]] between [[East Francia]] and the [[Margraviate of the Nordgau]] of [[Bavaria]].<ref>Compare: {{in lang|de}} [http://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/artikel/artikel_45427 Nürnberg, Reichsstadt: Politische und soziale Entwicklung] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118055026/http://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/artikel/artikel_45427 |date=18 November 2015 }} (Political and Social Development of the Imperial City of Nuremberg), ''[[:de:Historisches Lexikon Bayerns|Historisches Lexikon Bayerns]]'': "Nürnberg ist erstmals 1050 als Reichsburg inmitten eines großen Reichsgutkomplexes schriftlich bezeugt. [...] Die Stadt Nürnberg entstand um die Wende zum 11. Jahrhundert in Anlehnung an eine 1050 erstmals erwähnte Reichsburg inmitten eines ausgedehnten Reichsgutkomplexes in Ostfranken und dem bayerischen Nordgau." [The first written attestation of Nuremberg occurs in 1050 as an Imperial castle in the middle of an extensive complex of Imperial property. [...] The city of Nuremberg originated about the turn of the 11th century inconnection with an Imperial castle (first mentioned in 1050) in the centre of an expansive complex of Imperial property in East Franconia and in the Bavarian Nordgau.]</ref> From 1050 to 1572 the city expanded and rose dramatically in importance due to its location on key trade-routes. [[Conrad III of Germany|King Conrad&nbsp;III]], reigning as [[King of Germany]] from 1137 to 1152, established the [[Burgraviate of Nuremberg]], with the first [[burgrave]]s coming from the Austrian [[Raabs an der Thaya|House of Raabs]]. With the extinction of their male line around 1189, the last Raabs count's son-in-law, [[Frederick I, Burgrave of Nuremberg|Frederick I]] of the [[House of Hohenzollern]], inherited the burgraviate in 1193.

From the late 12th century to the [[Holy Roman Empire#Interregnum|Interregnum]] (1254–1573), however, the power of the burgraves diminished as the [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors transferred most non-military powers to a castellan, with the city administration and the municipal courts handed over to an Imperial mayor ({{langx|de|link=no|[[:de:Reichsschultheiß (Nürnberg)|Reichsschultheiß]]}}) from 1173/74.<ref name="HLB:Nürnberg Entwicklung"/><ref name="Cath:Nuremberg">{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia |id=11168a |title=Nuremberg}}</ref> The strained relations between the burgraves and the castellans, with gradual transferral of powers to the latter in the late 14th and early 15th centuries, finally broke out into open enmity, which greatly influenced the history of the city.<ref name="Cath:Nuremberg"/>

[[File:Nuernberg Burg Panorama PtGUI.jpg|left|thumb|The Imperial Castle]]

The city and particularly [[Nuremberg Castle]] would become one of the most frequent sites of the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] (after [[Regensburg]] and [[Frankfurt]]), the [[Diet of Nuremberg|Diets of Nuremberg]] from 1211 to 1543, after the first Nuremberg diet elected [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] as emperor. Because of the many Diets of Nuremberg, the city became an important routine place of the administration of the Empire during this time and a somewhat 'unofficial [[capital city|capital]]' of the Empire.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} In 1219 Emperor Frederick II granted the {{lang|de|Großen Freiheitsbrief}} ('Great Charter of Freedom'), including [[German town law|town rights]], [[Imperial immediacy]] ({{lang|de| Reichsfreiheit}}), the privilege to mint coins, and an independent customs policy – almost wholly removing the city from the purview of the burgraves.<ref name="HLB:Nürnberg Entwicklung">{{in lang|de}} [http://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/artikel/artikel_45427 Nürnberg, Reichsstadt: Politische und soziale Entwicklung] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118055026/http://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/artikel/artikel_45427 |date=18 November 2015 }} (Political and Social Development of the Imperial City of Nuremberg), ''[[:de:Historisches Lexikon Bayerns|Historisches Lexikon Bayerns]]''</ref><ref name="Cath:Nuremberg"/> Nuremberg soon became, with [[Augsburg]], one of the two great trade-centers on the route from [[Italy]] to Northern Europe.

In 1298, the [[Jews of Germany|Jews]] of the town were accused of [[host desecration]] and 698 of them were killed in one of the many [[Rintfleisch massacres]]. Behind the massacre of 1298 was also the desire to combine the northern and southern parts of the city,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Image Gallery of the Coins of Nürnberg |url=http://www.medievalcoinage.com/gallery/germany-nurnberg.htm |website=www.medievalcoinage.com |access-date=2020-05-20 |archive-date=8 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308233952/http://www.medievalcoinage.com/gallery/germany-nurnberg.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> which were divided by the [[Pegnitz (river)|Pegnitz]]. The Jews of the German lands suffered [[Black Death Jewish persecutions|many massacres]] during the [[Black Death|plague]] pandemic of the mid-14th century.

In 1349, Nuremberg's Jews suffered a [[pogrom]].<ref>"[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1114&letter=B Black Death] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804223403/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1114&letter=B |date=4 August 2011 }}".

[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - Nuremberga.png|right|thumb |Nuremberg in 1493 (from the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'')]]

The largest growth of Nuremberg occurred in the 14th century. [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]'s [[Golden Bull of 1356]], naming Nuremberg as the city where newly elected [[kings of Germany]] must hold their first Imperial Diet, made Nuremberg one of the three most important cities of the Empire.<ref name="HLB:Nürnberg Entwicklung"/> Charles was the patron of the [[Frauenkirche, Nuremberg|Frauenkirche]], built between 1352 and 1362 (the architect was likely [[Peter Parler]]), where the Imperial court worshipped during its stays in Nuremberg. The royal and Imperial connection grew stronger in 1423 when the Holy Roman Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxembourg]] granted the Imperial regalia to be kept permanently in Nuremberg, where they remained until 1796, when the [[War of the First Coalition|advance of French troops]] required their removal to [[Regensburg]] and thence to [[Vienna]].<ref name="HLB:Nürnberg Entwicklung"/>

In 1349 the members of the [[guild]]s unsuccessfully rebelled against the patricians in a {{lang|de| Handwerkeraufstand}} ('Craftsmen's Uprising'), supported by merchants and some by councillors, leading to a ban on any self-organisation of the artisans in the city, abolishing the guilds that were customary elsewhere in Europe; the unions were then dissolved, and the oligarchs remained in power while Nuremberg was a [[Free Imperial City|free city]] (until the early-19th century).<ref name="HLB:Nürnberg Entwicklung"/><ref name="Cath:Nuremberg"/> Charles IV conferred upon the city the right to conclude alliances independently, thereby placing it upon a politically equal footing with the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes of the Empire]].<ref name="Cath:Nuremberg"/> Frequent fights took place with the burgraves without, however, inflicting lasting damage upon the city. After fire destroyed the castle in 1420 during a feud between [[Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick IV]] (from 1417, [[Margrave of Brandenburg]]) and the duke of [[Bavaria-Ingolstadt]], the city purchased the ruins and the forest belonging to the castle (1427), resulting in the city's total sovereignty within its borders.

Through these and other acquisitions the city accumulated considerable territory.<ref name="Cath:Nuremberg"/> The [[Hussite Wars]] (1419–1434), the [[Black Death#Second plague pandemic|second Black Death pandemic]] in 1437, and the [[First Margrave War]] (1449–1450) led to a severe fall in population in the mid-15th century.<ref name="Cath:Nuremberg"/> Siding with [[Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria|Albert IV]], Duke of [[Bavaria-Munich]], in the [[War of the Succession of Landshut]] of 1503–1505, led the city to gain substantial territory, resulting in lands of {{convert|25|sqmi|1|abbr=on}}, making it one of the largest imperial cities.<ref name="Cath:Nuremberg"/>

During the Middle Ages, Nuremberg fostered a rich, varied, and influential literary culture.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sobecki |first1=Sebastian |title=Nuremberg |journal=Europe: A Literary History, 1348–1418, ed.

===Early modern age===
[[File:De Merian Frankoniae 090.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Nuremberg, 1648]]
The cultural flowering of Nuremberg in the 15th and 16th centuries made it the centre of the [[German Renaissance]]. In 1525 Nuremberg accepted the [[Protestant Reformation]], and in 1532 the [[Nuremberg Religious Peace]] was signed there, preventing war between Lutherans and Catholics<ref name="Cath:Nuremberg"/><ref>{{cite book |author1=Henry Eyster Jacobs |author2=John Augustus William Haas |title=The Lutheran Cyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3NBAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA351 |year=1899 |publisher=Scribner |page=351 |isbn=9780790550565}}</ref> for 15 years.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} During the Princes' [[Second Schmalkaldic War|1552 revolution]] against [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], Nuremberg tried to purchase its neutrality, but Margrave [[Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach|Albert Alcibiades]], one of the leaders of the revolt, attacked the city without a declaration of war and dictated a disadvantageous peace.<ref name="Cath:Nuremberg"/> At the 1555 [[Peace of Augsburg]], the possessions of the Protestants were confirmed by the Emperor, their religious privileges extended and their independence from the [[Bishopric of Bamberg|Bishop of Bamberg]] affirmed, while the 1520s' secularisation of the monasteries was also approved.<ref name="Cath:Nuremberg"/> Families like the [[Tucher von Simmelsdorf|Tucher]], [[Imhoff family|Imhoff]] or [[Haller von Hallerstein|Haller]] ran trading businesses across Europe, similar to the [[Fugger family|Fugger]] and [[Welser]] families from [[Augsburg]], although on a slightly smaller scale.

[[File:Old town hall.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Wolffscher Bau'' of the old city hall]]
The state of affairs in the early 16th century{{clarify|date=July 2023}}, increased trade routes elsewhere and the ossification of the social hierarchy and legal structures contributed to the decline in trade.<ref name="Cath:Nuremberg"/> During the [[Thirty Years' War]], frequent quartering of Imperial, Swedish and [[Catholic League (German)|League]] soldiers, the financial costs of the war and the cessation of trade caused irreparable damage to the city and a near-halving of the population.<ref name="Cath:Nuremberg"/> In 1632, the city, occupied by the forces of [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]], was [[siege of Nuremberg|besieged]] by the army of Imperial general [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]]. The city declined after the war and recovered its importance only in the 19th century, when it grew as an industrial centre. Even after the Thirty Years' War, however, there was a late flowering of architecture and culture; secular [[Baroque architecture]] is exemplified in the layout of the civic gardens built outside the city walls, and in the Protestant city's rebuilding of [[St. Egidien, Nuremberg|St. Egidien church]], destroyed by fire at the beginning of the 18th century, considered a significant contribution to the baroque church architecture of Middle Franconia.<ref name="HLB:Nürnberg Entwicklung"/>

After the Thirty Years' War, Nuremberg attempted to remain detached from external affairs, but contributions were demanded for the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] and the [[Seven Years' War]] and restrictions of imports and exports deprived the city of many markets for its manufactures.<ref name="Cath:Nuremberg"/> The Bavarian elector, [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Charles Theodore]], appropriated part of the land obtained by the city during the [[Landshut War of Succession]], to which Bavaria had maintained its claim; Prussia also claimed part of the territory. Realising its weakness, the city asked to be incorporated into Prussia but [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Frederick William II]] refused, fearing to offend Austria, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and France.<ref name="Cath:Nuremberg"/> At the Imperial diet in 1803, the independence of Nuremberg was affirmed, but on the signing of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] on 12 July 1806, it was agreed to hand the city over to Bavaria from 8 September, with Bavaria guaranteeing the [[Amortization (accounting)|amortisation]] of the city's 12.5&nbsp;million guilder public debt.<ref name="Cath:Nuremberg"/>

===After the Napoleonic Wars===

[[File:Adler Originalfoto.jpg|right|thumb|The British-built ''[[Adler (locomotive)|Adler]]'' was the locomotive of the first German Railway between Nuremberg and Fürth.]]

After the fall of [[Napoleon]], the city's trade and commerce revived; the skill of its inhabitants together with its favourable situation soon made the city prosperous, particularly after its public debt had been acknowledged as a part of the Bavarian national debt. Having been incorporated into a Catholic country, the city was compelled to refrain from further discrimination against Catholics, who had been excluded from the rights of citizenship. Catholic services had been celebrated in the city by the priests of the [[Teutonic Order]], often under great difficulties. After their possessions had been confiscated by the Bavarian government in 1806, they were given the Frauenkirche on the Market in 1809; in 1810 the first Catholic parish was established, which in 1818 numbered 1,010 people.<ref name="Cath:Nuremberg"/><!--Catholic Encyclopedia: possibly biased for this kind of info? also, possibly outdated (1913) - WP:RSAGE-->

In 1817, the city was incorporated into the district of [[Rezatkreis]] (named for the river [[Fränkische Rezat|Franconian Rezat]]), which was renamed to [[Middle Franconia]] ({{langx|de|[[:de:Mittelfranken|Mittelfranken]]}}) on 1 January 1838.<ref name="Cath:Nuremberg"/> The first German railway, the [[Bavarian Ludwigsbahn]], from Nuremberg to nearby [[Fürth]], was opened in 1835. The establishment of railways and the incorporation of Bavaria into [[Zollverein]] (the 19th-century German Customs Union), commerce and industry opened the way to greater prosperity.<ref name="Cath:Nuremberg"/> In 1852, there were 53,638 inhabitants: 46,441 Protestants and 6,616 Catholics. It subsequently grew to become the more important industrial city of Southern Germany, one of the most prosperous towns of southern Germany, but after the [[Austro-Prussian War]] it was given to [[Prussia]] as part of their telegraph stations they had to give up. In 1905, its population, including several incorporated suburbs, was 291,351: 86,943 Catholics, 196,913 Protestants, 3,738 Jews and 3,766 members of other religions.<ref name="Cath:Nuremberg"/> The ''Fränkischer Kurier'' was published as a local newspaper in Nuremberg.

===Nazi-Era===
[[File:Reichsparteitag 1935 Großer Appell 28-1121M original.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Nuremberg rally]], 1935]]
Nuremberg held great significance during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] era. Because of the city's relevance to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and its position in the centre of Germany, the [[Nazi Party]] chose the city to be the site of huge Nazi Party conventions: the [[Nuremberg Rally|Nuremberg rallies]]. The rallies were held in 1927, 1929 and annually from 1933 through 1938. A number of buildings and large gathering areas known collectively as the [[Nazi Party Rally Grounds]], some of which were not finished, were designed by [[Albert Speer]] and were constructed solely for these assemblies. After [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power]] in 1933 the Nuremberg rallies became huge [[Nazi propaganda]] events, a centre of Nazi ideals. The 1934 rally was filmed by [[Leni Riefenstahl]], and made into a propaganda film called ''Triumph des Willens'' (''[[Triumph of the Will]]''). At the 1935 rally, Hitler specifically ordered the ''[[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]]'' to convene at Nuremberg to pass the [[Nuremberg Laws]] which revoked German [[citizenship]] for all Jews and other non-Aryans. 

The Nazi ''[[Burgomaster|Oberbürgermeister]]'' of the city, [[Willy Liebel]], embarked upon a program of urban architectural renewal that he felt befitted one of the centers of Nazi pageantry. The aim was to restore the city center to the medieval look of centuries past by eliminating late nineteenth-century styling. Among the buildings he slated for demolition was the [[Grand Synagogue of Nuremberg]]. He felt that this "foreign" building with its [[Moorish revival]] architecture could not be reconciled with the image that he strove to create, and he succeeded in having the building completely demolished around the time of the Party rally in September 1938.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hagen |first1=Joshua |last2=Ostergren |first2=Robert |title=Spectacle, architecture and place at the Nuremberg Party Rallies: projecting a Nazi vision of past, present and future |journal=Cultural Geographies |date=April 2006 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=169–170 |doi=10.1191/1474474006eu355oa |bibcode=2006CuGeo..13..157H |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00572185/file/PEER_stage2_10.1191%252F1474474006eu355oa.pdf |access-date=30 September 2024 |archive-date=4 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190504143957/https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00572185/file/PEER_stage2_10.1191%2F1474474006eu355oa.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> Many examples of [[Nazi architecture]] can still be seen in the city.

On [[Bombing of Nuremberg in World War II|2 January 1945, the medieval city centre was systematically bombed]] by the [[Royal Air Force]] and the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] and about ninety percent of it was destroyed in only one hour, with 1,800 residents killed and roughly 100,000 displaced. In February 1945, additional attacks followed. In total, about 6,000 Nuremberg residents are estimated to have been killed in air raids.

Nuremberg was a heavily fortified city that was captured in [[Battle of Nuremberg (1945)|a fierce battle]] lasting from 17 to 20 April 1945 by the U.S. [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]], [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd Infantry Division]] and [[45th Infantry Division (United States)|45th Infantry Division]], which fought house-to-house and street-by-street against determined German resistance, causing further urban devastation to the already bombed and shelled buildings.<ref>Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939–1946'', Stackpole Books (Revised Edition 2006), p. 90, 129, 135</ref> Despite this intense degree of destruction, the city was rebuilt after the war and was to some extent restored to its pre-war appearance, including the reconstruction of many of its medieval buildings.<ref>Neil Gregor, Haunted City.

===Nuremberg trials===
{{main|Nuremberg trials}}
[[File:Defendants in the dock at nuremberg trials.jpg|thumb|Defendants in the dock at the Nuremberg trials]]
Between 1945 and 1946, German officials involved in [[war crime]]s and crimes against humanity were brought before an international tribunal in the Nuremberg trials. The [[Soviet Union]] had wanted these trials to take place in [[Berlin]]. However, Nuremberg was chosen as the site for the trials for specific reasons:
* The city had been the location of the Nazi Party's Nuremberg rallies and the laws stripping Jews of their citizenship were passed there. There was symbolic value in making it the place of Nazi demise.
* The [[Palace of Justice, Nuremberg|Palace of Justice]] was spacious and largely undamaged (one of the few that had remained largely intact despite [[Strategic bombing during World War II|extensive Allied bombing of Germany]]). The already large courtroom was reasonably easily expanded by the removal of the wall at the end opposite the bench, thereby incorporating the adjoining room. A large prison was also part of the complex.
* As a compromise, it was agreed that Berlin would become the permanent seat of the International Military Tribunal and that the first trial (several were planned) would take place in Nuremberg. Due to the [[Cold War]], subsequent trials never took place.

Following the trials, in October 1946, many prominent German Nazi politicians and military leaders were [[Nuremberg executions|executed in Nuremberg]].

The same courtroom in Nuremberg was the venue of the [[Subsequent Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg Military Tribunals]], organized by the United States as [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupying power]] in the area.

In order to come to terms with the role Nuremberg played during the [[Third Reich]], the city established the [[Nuremberg International Human Rights Award]] in 1995, awarded every two years to individuals or groups defending human rights worldwide.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nuernberg.de/internet/menschenrechte_e/menschenrechtspreis_e.html | title=International Nuremberg Human Rights Award - Human Rights Office of the City of Nuremberg | access-date=26 October 2023 | archive-date=7 October 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231007213847/https://www.nuernberg.de/internet/menschenrechte_e/menschenrechtspreis_e.html | url-status=live }}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Nuremberg Map.png|upright=0.9|thumb|Map of Nuremberg]]
[[File:Bavaria N.svg|thumb|Location of Nuremberg (in red) in Middle Franconia (light red) in Bavaria (dark grey)]]
Several old villages now belong to the city, for example [[Grossgründlach]], [[Kraftshof]], [[Thon (Nuremberg)|Thon]], and [[Neunhof]] in the north-west; [[Ziegelstein]] in the northeast, [[Altenfurt]] and [[Fischbach (Nuremberg)|Fischbach]] in the south-east; and [[Katzwang]], [[Kornburg]] in the south. [[Langwasser]] is a modern suburb.

=== Climate ===
Nuremberg has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb'') with a certain [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] influence (''Dfb''), categorized in the latter by the 0&nbsp;°C isotherm.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=36701&cityname=Nuremberg,+Germany |title=Nuremberg, Germany Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase) |website=Weatherbase |access-date=2019-02-03 |archive-date=4 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204014741/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=36701&cityname=Nuremberg,+Germany |url-status=live }}</ref> The city's climate is influenced by its inland position and higher altitude. Winters are changeable, with either mild or cold weather: the average temperature is around {{convert|-3|°C|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|4|°C|0|abbr=on}}, while summers are generally warm, mostly around {{convert|13|°C|0|abbr=on}} at night to {{convert|25|°C|0|abbr=on}} in the afternoon. Precipitation is evenly spread throughout the year, although February and April tend to be a bit drier whereas July tends to have more rainfall.<ref name="dwd"/>

Nuremberg for many people is still associated with its traditional gingerbread (''[[Lebkuchen]]'') products, sausages, and handmade toys. [[Pocket watch]]es — ''[[Nuremberg eggs]]'' — were made here in the 16th century by [[Peter Henlein]]. Only one of the districts in the 1797–1801 sample was early industrial; the economic structure of the region around Nuremberg was dominated by metal and glass manufacturing, reflected by a share of nearly 50% handicrafts and workers.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Baten |first=Joerg |date=2000 |title=Economic development and the distribution of nutritional resources in Bavaria, 1797–1839: An anthropometric study |journal=Journal of Income Distribution |volume=9 |pages=89–106 |doi=10.1016/S0926-6437(99)00014-1}}</ref> In the 19th century Nuremberg became the "industrial heart" of [[Bavaria]] with companies such as [[Siemens]] and [[MAN SE|MAN]] establishing a strong base in the city.

Items manufactured in the area include electrical equipment, mechanical and optical products, motor vehicles, writing and drawing paraphernalia, stationery products and printed materials.

The city is also strong in the fields of automation, energy and medical technology. Siemens is still the largest industrial employer in the Nuremberg region but a good third of German market research agencies are also located in the city.

Nuremberg is [[Bavaria]]'s second largest city after [[Munich]], and a popular tourist destination for foreigners and Germans alike. It was a leading city 500 years ago, but 90% of the town was destroyed in 1945 during the war. After [[World War II]], many medieval-style areas of the town were rebuilt.

[[File:Albrecht-Dürer-Haus - Tiergärtnerplatz - Nuremberg, Germany - DSC02033.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Albrecht Dürer's House]]]]
[[File:Christkindlesmarkt nuernberg.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Christkindlesmarkt, Nuremberg|Christkindlesmarkt]] with ''Schöner Brunnen'']]Nuremberg was an early centre of humanism, science, printing, and mechanical invention. The city contributed much to the science of [[astronomy]]. In 1471 Johannes Mueller of [[Königsberg, Bavaria|Königsberg]] (Bavaria), later called [[Regiomontanus]], built an astronomical observatory in Nuremberg and published many important astronomical charts.

In 1515, [[Albrecht Dürer]], a native of Nuremberg, created woodcuts of the first maps of the stars of the northern and southern hemispheres, producing the first printed star charts, which had been ordered by [[Johannes Stabius]]. Around 1515 Dürer also published the "Stabiussche Weltkarte", the first perspective drawing of the terrestrial globe.<ref>{{cite book |first=Wilhelm |last=Waetzoldt |title=Dürer und seine Zeit |date=1935 |publisher=Phaedon |place=Vienna |pages=306–309}}</ref>

Printers and publishers have a long history in Nuremberg. Many of these publishers worked with well-known artists of the day to produce books that could also be considered works of art. In 1470 [[Anton Koberger]] opened Europe's first print shop in Nuremberg. In 1493, he published the ''Nuremberg Chronicles'', also known as the ''World Chronicles'' (''Schedelsche Weltchronik''), an illustrated history of the world from the creation to the present day. It was written in the local Franconian dialect by [[Hartmann Schedel]] and had illustrations by [[Michael Wolgemut|Michael Wohlgemuth]], [[Hans Pleydenwurff|Wilhelm Pleydenwurff]], and Albrecht Dürer. Others furthered geographical knowledge and travel by map making. Notable among these was navigator and geographer [[Martin Behaim]], who made the first world globe.

Sculptors such as [[Veit Stoss]], [[Adam Kraft]] and [[Peter Vischer the Elder|Peter Vischer]] are also associated with Nuremberg.

Composed of prosperous artisans, the guilds of the [[Meistersinger]]s flourished here. [[Richard Wagner]] made their most famous member, [[Hans Sachs]], the hero of his opera ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]''. Baroque composer [[Johann Pachelbel]] was born here and was organist of [[St. Sebaldus Church]].

The [[Academy of Fine Arts, Nuremberg|academy of fine arts]] situated in Nuremberg is the oldest art academy in central Europe and looks back to a tradition of 350 years of artistic education.

Nuremberg is also famous for its [[Christkindlesmarkt, Nuremberg|Christkindlesmarkt]] (Christmas market), which draws well over a million shoppers each year. The market is famous for its handmade ornaments and delicacies.

== Politics ==
Nuremberg is represented in the [[Bundestag]] by two [[List of Bundestag constituencies|constituencies]]; [[Nuremberg North]] and [[Nuremberg South]]. Since 2002, both constituencies have been held by the CSU.

From 1957 to 1987, the position of Chief Mayor (Oberbürgermeister) was continuously held by Andreas Urschlechter (SPD) for 30 years.

The city's location next to numerous highways, railways, and a waterway has contributed to its rising importance for trade with Eastern Europe.

===Railways===

{{Lang|de|[[Nürnberg Hauptbahnhof]]|italic=no}} is a stop for [[InterCity|IC]] and [[Intercity-Express|ICE]] trains on the German long-distance railway network. The [[Nuremberg–Munich high-speed railway|Nuremberg–Ingolstadt–Munich high-speed line]] with {{convert|300|km/h|0|abbr=on}} operation opened 28 May 2006, and was fully integrated into the rail schedule on 10 December 2006.

The [[Trams in Nuremberg|Nuremberg tramway network]] was opened in 1881. {{As of|2008}}, it extends a total length of {{convert|36|km|mi|abbr=on}}, has six lines, and carried 39.152&nbsp;million passengers annually. The first segment of the [[Nuremberg U-Bahn]] metro system was opened in 1972. Nuremberg's trams, [[bus]]es and U-Bahn are operated by the {{Lang|de|[[Verkehrs-Aktiengesellschaft Nürnberg]]}} (VAG; Nuremberg Transport Corporation), a member of the ''[[Verkehrsverbund Großraum Nürnberg]]'' (VGN; Greater Nuremberg Transport Network).

There is also a [[Nuremberg S-Bahn]] suburban metro railway and a regional train network, both centred on {{lang|de|[[Nürnberg Hauptbahnhof]]|italic=no}}. Since 2008, Nuremberg has had the first U-Bahn in Germany (U2/U21 and U3) that works without a driver. It also was the first subway system worldwide in which both driver-operated trains and computer-controlled trains shared tracks.
