Mangalagiri translates to ''The Auspicious Hill'' (''Mangala'' = ''Auspicious'', ''Giri'' = ''Hill'') in the local language. It was derived from the name ''Totadri''.<ref name="municipality">{{cite web |title=Mangalagiri Municipality |url=http://cdma.ap.gov.in/MANGALAGIRI/ |access-date=19 November 2014 |website=Commissioner & Director of Municipal Administration |publisher=Municipal Administration & Urban Development Department, Govt. of Andhra Pradesh}}</ref> During [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara Kingdom rule]], it was also known as ''Mangala Nilayam''.<ref name="history">{{cite web |title=Vijaya Nagara Kingdom Founders from Mangalagiri |url=http://www.mangalagiri.net/history.html#vijayanagar |access-date=12 April 2015 |publisher=mangalagiri.net}}</ref><ref name=temple>{{cite web|title=Mangalagiri – The Auspicious Hill|url=http://guntur.nic.in/mangalagiri_temple.html|publisher=National Informatics Centre|access-date=3 August 2014}}</ref>

== History ==
{{More citations needed section|date=January 2021}}
It is dated to 1520 and mentions the capture of Kondavidu by [[Timmarusu]], general of [[Krishnadevaraya|Sri Krishnadevaraya]], in 1515 from the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati rulers]] of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] (ancient [[Odisha]]). Another stone near the temple of Garudalvar has inscriptions on four sides recording grants in the reign of [[Sadasiva Raya]] of [[Vijayanagara Empire]] in 1538. The lofty [[gopuram]] in the temple at the foot of the hill was erected by [[Vasireddy Venkatadri Nayudu|Raja Vasireddy Venkatadri Nayudu]] in 1807–1809, and in terms of sculpture and architecture this temple stands to be an ultimate testament for the ancient vishwakarma sthapathis in planning and sculpting these temples.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mangalagiri.net/history.html|title=Mangalagiri}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://iap.iisc.ernet.in/~hrishikesh/documents/mangalagiri.pdf|title=Mangalagiri}}</ref>

Mangalagiri was under the control of [[Qutb Shahi dynasty|Golkonda Nawabs]] for a long period. It was plundered in 1780 by Hyder Jung but could not be conquered. In 1816, a gang of [[Pindari]]s again looted the place. It slowly recovered from these two attacks during the time of [[Vasireddy Venkatadri Nayudu|Raja Vasireddy Venkatadri Nayudu]] who ruled the place from [[Amaravati]]. There is a big ''koneru'' (tank) in the center of the place which went dry in 1882. As many as 9,840 guns and 44 bullets which might have been related to Pindaris have been found here after the Pindaris looted this place. The picturesque hill was visited by the great [[Krishnadevaraya|Sri Krishna Deva Raya]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guntur.nic.in/mangalagiri_temple.html|title=Mangalagiri - The Auspicious Hill}}</ref>

In the 1970s there was huge [[water scarcity]] in Mangalagiri. Goli Gopala Rao, the then Municipal Chairman of Mangalagiri, brought water to the town through water pipelines and he was called "Apara Baghiratha" due to his services to the public.
