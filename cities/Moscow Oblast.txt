Located in [[European Russia]] between latitudes [[54th parallel north|54°]] and [[57th parallel north|57° N]] and longitudes [[35th meridian east|35°]] and [[41st meridian east|41° E]], Moscow Oblast borders [[Tver Oblast]] in the northwest, [[Yaroslavl Oblast]] in the north, [[Vladimir Oblast]] in the northeast and east, [[Ryazan Oblast]] in the southeast, [[Tula Oblast]] in the south, [[Kaluga Oblast]] in the southwest, and [[Smolensk Oblast]] in the west. The oblast mostly surrounds the [[Federal cities of Russia|federal city]] of Moscow, which is not part of the oblast, but rather a separate federal subject in its own right. The oblast is highly [[Industrialisation|industrialized]], with the major industries being [[metallurgy]], [[oil refining]], and [[mechanical engineering]], along with the food, energy, and chemical industries.

==Geography==
[[File:Moscow region.png|thumb|Map of Moscow Oblast and the federal city of Moscow]]

===Relief===
The oblast is mostly flat, with some hills with a height of about {{convert|160|m|sp=us}} in the western and extensive lowlands in the eastern part. From the southwest to northeast, the oblast is crossed by the border of the Moscow glacier to the north of the common ice-[[erosion (geology)|erosion]] form with [[moraine]] ridges, and to the south are only erosional landforms. The western and northern parts of the oblast contain the Moscow Uplands. Their average height peaks at about {{convert|300|m|sp=us}} near [[Dmitrov]] and the upper point of {{convert|310|m|sp=us}} lies near the village of [[Shapkino, Mozhaysky District, Moscow Oblast|Shapkino]] in [[Mozhaysky District, Moscow Oblast|Mozhaysky District]]. The northern part of the Moscow Uplands is steeper than the southern part. The uplands contain lakes of glacial origin, such as Lakes Nerskoye and Krugloye. To the north of the Moscow Uplands lies the alluvial Verhnevolzhsk Depression; It is marshy and flat with the height varying between about {{convert|120|m|sp=us}} and {{convert|150|m|sp=us}}.<ref>Wagner, pp.&nbsp;31–32</ref>

To the south stretches a hilly area of the Moskvoretsko-Oksk plain. Its greatest height of {{convert|254|m|sp=us}} lies in the area of [[Tyoply Stan District|Tyoply Stan]], within the Moscow city limits. The plain has clearly defined river valleys, especially in the south parts, and occasional [[karst]] relief, mostly in [[Serpukhovsky District]]. In the extreme south, after the Oka River, lies the [[Central Russian Upland]]. It contains numerous gullies and ravines and has average height above 200 m with the maximum of 236 m near [[Pushchino]].<ref>Wagner, pp. 32–35</ref>

Most of the eastern part of Moscow Oblast is taken by the vast [[Meshchera Lowlands]] with much wetland in their eastern part. Their highest hill peaks at {{convert|214|m|sp=us}} but the average heights are {{convert|120|-|150|m|sp=us}}. Most lakes of the lowlands, such as Lakes Chyornoye and Svyatoye, are of glacial origin. Here lies the lowest natural elevation of the region, the water level of Oka River at {{convert|97|m|sp=us}}.<ref>Wagner, pp. 35–36</ref><ref>[http://www.moskvaobl.ru/ Moscow Oblast] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014134331/http://www.moskvaobl.ru/ |date=October 14, 2013}} moskvaobl.ru (in Russian)</ref>

===Geology and minerals===

====Geology====
[[File:Dolomite-Magnésite- Navarre.jpg|thumb|Dolomite]]
[[File:Gneiss.jpg|thumb|Gneiss]]

Moscow Oblast is located in the central part of the [[East European craton]]. Like all cratons, the latter is composed of the crystalline basement and sedimentary cover. The basement consists of [[Archean|Archaean]] and [[Proterozoic]] rocks and the cover is deposited in the [[Palaeozoic]], [[Mesozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]] eras. The lowest depth of the basement ({{convert|1000|m|sp=us}}) is to the south of [[Serebryanye Prudy]], in the very south area of the oblast, and the largest ({{convert|4200|m|sp=us}}) is to the east of [[Sergiyev Posad]], in the northeast region.<ref>Wagner, p. 5</ref>

[[Tertiary]] deposits are almost absent within the oblast. Significantly more abundant are deposits of the [[Carboniferous]] and [[Jurassic]] periods. In the [[Cretaceous]] period, a sea was covering Moscow Oblast, as evidenced by [[phosphate]] deposits and a variety of sands. Cretaceous sediments are most common in the north of the oblast. The sea was wider in Jurassic than in Cretaceous period. Typical Jurassic deposits, in the form of black clay, are found within and around the city of Moscow and in the valley of the [[Moscow River]]. Carboniferous deposits in Moscow Oblast are represented by [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]], [[limestone]], and [[marl]]. Coal deposits rich in organic remains occur in the south, especially in Serpukhovsky District, and in the western regions. [[Devonian]] deposits were also found within the region.<ref>Wagner</ref>

[[Quaternary]] deposits are widely distributed in Moscow Oblast; their thickness decreases from the northwest to southeast. It is believed<ref>Wagner, p. 15</ref> that there were four glaciations in the area. The first occurred in the Lower [[Pleistocene]] and spread to the east–west part of the Oka River valley, it left almost no trace in the region. In the [[Middle Pleistocene]], there were two powerful glaciations. The Dnieper glacier covered a large part of the Russian Plain, whereas the Moscow glaciation stopped just south of the present city of Moscow. The last glaciation, the Valdai glaciation, occurred in the [[Late Pleistocene]]; it did not directly affect the territory of Moscow Oblast, but left traces in the form of [[fluvioglacial deposits]], mainly in the north area. The glaciers left behind a [[moraine]] [[loam]] with pebbles and boulders of various rocks, such as [[granite]], [[gneiss]], [[quartzite]], [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]], [[limestone]] and [[sandstone]]. Its thickness varies between a few meters at watersheds and 100 m at moraine ridges.<ref>Wagner, pp. 15–18</ref>

====Minerals====
Moscow Oblast is rich in minerals. Sands from the sediments of different periods (mainly Quaternary and Cretaceous) are of high quality and are widely used in construction. Quartz sand (milled [[quartz]]) is used in the glass industry, their production is conducted from the end of 17th century near [[Lyubertsy]]. Much of the production is currently halted due to environmental concerns, and only the Yeganovskoye field is being exploited; its silica sand reserves are 33 million tonnes and annual production reaches 675,000 tonnes.<ref>Wagner, p. 76</ref> Sand and gravel deposits are abundant within the Smolensk-Moscow Upland. [[Sandstone]] deposits are developed in [[Klinsky District|Klinsky]] and [[Dmitrovsky District, Moscow Oblast|Dmitrovsky Districts]].

There are numerous clay deposits within the oblast; fusible clay is excavated in [[Sergiyev Posad]]. The Yeldiginskoye field near the village of [[Sofrino]] has reserves estimated at 30 million cubic meters; its annual production reaches {{convert|600000|m3|sp=us}}. Refractory white clay occurs in the eastern region, in the Carboniferous and Jurassic sediments, and is extracted from the 14th century near [[Gzhel]]. The largest (Kudinovskoye) deposit is near the town of [[Elektrougli]] with the reserves of 3 billion tonnes. Also widespread are loams which are used in brick manufacture and [[limestone]]s ("white stone"). The famous [[Myachkovo, Moscow Oblast|Myachkovo]] deposit of [[carboniferous limestone]] provided material that went for cladding of such buildings in Moscow as the [[Bolshoi Theatre|Bolshoi Theater]]. The mining in Myachkovo had been stopped and currently, limestone is provided by the quarries of [[Podolsky District|Podolsky]], [[Voskresensky District, Moscow Oblast|Voskresensky]], and [[Kolomensky District]]s. The latter district also provides marble-like limestone.<ref>Wagner, pp. 73–76</ref>

Other industrial minerals of Moscow Oblast are dolomite, limestone [[tuff]], and [[marl]]; mostly in the southern and eastern parts. Dolomite is used in the cement industry. Its mining is concentrated mainly near [[Shchyolkovo]], the reserves exceed 20 million tonnes and the annual production is about 650 tonnes.<ref>Wagner, pp. 77–78</ref>

Phosphates are produced in the Yegorevskoye and Severskoye fields. Meshchera and Verkhnevolzhsk Lowlands are rich in [[peat]]. The largest mines are "Ryazanovskoe" (840,000 tonnes per year) and "Radovitsky moss" (760,000 tonnes per year), both around [[Yegoryevsk]].<ref>Wagner, p. 71</ref><ref>[http://www.shaturtorf.ru/ Site OAO Shaturtorf"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111064450/http://shaturtorf.ru/ |date=November 11, 2012}}. Shaturtorf.ru. Retrieved on 2012-08-05.</ref> There are deposits of [[brown coal]] beyond the Oka River, but they have no commercial value. There are also minor deposits of titanium and [[iron ore]] in Serpukhovsky and [[Serebryano-Prudsky District]]s.

Salts of potassium salt are being developed around Serpukhov and Yegoryevsk. There are also numerous mineral springs near Zvenigorod, Klin, and Serpukhov. They include surface springs and reservoirs at the depth of {{convert|300|-|500|m|ft|sp=us}}. Deeper, at {{convert|1|-|1.5|km|mi|sp=us}} there is a large sea of salt extending beyond Moscow Oblast. Waters with the salt concentration up to 300 g/L are used in the local food industry and spas.<ref>Wagner, p. 79</ref>

===Climate===
[[File:Ледяной лес.jpg|thumb|In winter]]

The climate of Moscow Oblast is [[humid continental]], with clearly expressed seasonality&nbsp;– short but warm summers and long, cold winters; the continentality increases from northwest to southeast. The period of the average temperature below {{convert|0|C}} lasts 130–150 days, beginning in early or mid-November and ending in late March (or very early April). The average annual temperature varies from {{convert|+3.5|C}} to {{convert|+5.5|C}}. The coldest months are January and February with the average temperature of {{convert|-9|C}} in the west and {{convert|-12|C}} in the east. With the arrival of arctic air, the temperature drops to below {{convert|-20|C}} that may last up to twenty days during the winter, with the temperatures reaching {{convert|-45|C}}. The minimum temperature of {{convert|-54|C}} was observed in [[Naro-Fominsk]]. Thaws often occur in December and February due to the Atlantic, and rarely the Mediterranean [[cyclone]]s. The thaws usually last several days, and their total number from November to March can reach fifty. Snow starts accumulating in November, though sometimes in late October or early December, and disappears in mid-April (sometimes in late March). The snow depth is {{convert|25|-|50|cm|in|sp=us}} and the soil freezes to {{convert|65|-|75|cm|in|sp=us}}. The warmest month is July with the average temperature of {{convert|+18.0|C}} in the northwest and {{convert|+20.0|C}} in the southeast. The maximum temperature of {{convert|+40|C}} was recorded in [[Kolomna]] during [[2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat waves]]. The average annual rainfall is {{convert|450|-|650|mm|in|sp=us}}, the precipitation is maximal in the northwestern and minimal in the southeastern regions. The summer precipitation is usually {{convert|75|mm|in|sp=us}}, but severe droughts occur once in 25–30 years, with less than {{convert|5|mm|in|sp=us}} of rain over June–August.<ref name="brit">{{cite web|title=Moscow (oblast, Russia)|url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/393408/Moscow|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=August 1, 2010|archive-date=July 28, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728091421/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/393408/Moscow|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Myachkovo NA, Sorokin VN, Climate of Moscow Oblast, Moscow, 1991 (in Russian)</ref>

===Rivers and lakes===
[[File:Shosha river01.jpg|thumb|The [[Shosha River]] near the ''[[village#Russia|selo]]'' of [[Mikulino, Moscow Oblast|Mikulino]]]]

There are more than three hundred rivers with the length above {{convert|10|km|sp=us}} in Moscow Oblast. All rivers are calm and have well-developed valleys and [[floodplain]]s. They are mostly fed by melting snow and the flood falls on April–May. The water level is low in summer and increases only with heavy rain. The rivers freeze over from late November until mid-April. The only navigable rivers are the [[Volga River|Volga]], the [[Oka River|Oka]], and the [[Moskva River]].<ref name="wr">Wagner BB, Klevkova IV [http://www.wagner.pp.ru/~bert/moscow/river2.pdf Rivers of Moscow region] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309003313/http://www.wagner.pp.ru/~bert/moscow/river2.pdf |date=March 9, 2012}} Moscow, MGPU, 2003.</ref>

Most rivers belong to the basin of the [[Volga River|Volga]], which itself only crosses a small part in the north of Moscow Oblast, near the border with [[Tver Oblast]]. The second largest river of the region is the Oka. The northern part of Moscow Oblast includes such Volga [[tributary|tributaries]] as the [[Shosha River|Shosha]], the [[Lama River|Lama]], the [[Dubna River (Volga basin)|Dubna]], the [[Sestra River (Moscow Oblast)|Sestra]], and the Yakhroma. On the south flow the tributaries of the Oka, including the [[Nara River (Russia)|Nara]], the [[Protva River|Protva]], and the [[Lopasnya River]]s. The Moskva River, which almost entirely flows within the oblast, also belongs to the Oka basin. The eastern and northeastern regions, including much of Meschersk Depression, are irrigated by the tributaries of the [[Klyazma River]], which itself is a main tributary of the Oka.<ref name="wr" />

The [[Moscow Canal]] crosses the northern part of Moscow Oblast through the Ikshinskyoe, Klyazminskoye, Pyalovskoye, and Pestovskoye Reservoirs. In the basin of the Moskva River, there are also Ozerninskoye, Mozhayskoye, Istrinskoye, and Ruza Reservoirs, providing Moscow with drinking water.<ref name=wr/>

There are about 350 lakes in the oblast, almost all are shallow (5–10 m) and many are of glacial origin. The largest are {{ill|Lake Dubovoye|ru|Дубовое (озеро)}} ({{convert|11.8|km2|sp=us}}) and [[Lake Svyatoye|Svyatoye]] ({{convert|11.6|km2|sp=us}}) whereas the deepest ({{convert|32|m|sp=us}}) is Lake Glubokoye in [[Ruzsky District]]. There are also many marshes, especially within the Meshchersk and Verkhnevolzhsk lowlands.<ref>Wagner BB, Dmitrieva VT [http://www.wagner.pp.ru/~bert/moscow/lakes.pdf Lakes and reservoirs of the Moscow region] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201118232905/http://www.wagner.pp.ru/~bert/moscow/lakes.pdf |date=November 18, 2020}} Moscow, MGPU 2004</ref>

===Soils===
[[File:russian landscape.jpg|thumb|A typical landscape of Moscow Oblast]]

The oblast is dominated by relatively infertile [[podsol]] soils which require fertilizers for commercial agriculture. On the hills there is more [[loam]] and the low-lying areas have more of bog, sandy loam and sand. [[Chernozem]] is scarce and occurs only south of the Oka River. Gray forest soils are spread between the Oka, Moskva, and Klyazma Rivers, mostly in [[Ramensky District|Ramensky]] and Voskresensky Districts. Marshy soils are common in Meshchersk and Verkhnevolzhsk lowlands. Valleys of large rivers are rich in alluvial soils. In general, soils are heavily polluted with chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and household and industrial waste, especially around Moscow, [[Orekhovo-Zuyevo]], [[Noginsk]], and Voskresensk.

Moscow Oblast lies within the zone of forests and steppes with forests covering over 40% of the region. [[Coniferous]] (mainly fir) trees dominate the northern (Verkhnevolzhsk lowlands) and western parts (Mozhaysky, Lotoshinsky, and Shakhovsky Districts). Forests of Meshchora consist primarily of pine; in waterlogged lowlands, there are individual [[alder]] forests. Central and eastern regions have coniferous-deciduous forests with the main tree species of [[spruce]], [[pine]], [[birch]], and [[aspen]] often mixed with bushes of [[hazel]]. To the south lies the subzone of broad-leaved forests of [[oak]], [[Lime (fruit)|lime]], [[maple]] and [[elm]]. Moscow-Oka Upland is the transition zone which is dominated by spruce, for example, in the upper reaches of the [[Lopasnya River]]. Valleys of the Oka are covered in pine forests of the steppe type and the far south regions (Serebryano-Prudsky and partially Serpukhovsky Districts) are cultivated steppes with occasional lime and oak groves.<ref>Lyubimova EL, Flora of Podmoskovie, Moscow, 1964</ref>

The intensive cutting of Moscow region forests in the 18–19th centuries reduced them and changed their species: conifers were replaced by [[birch]] and [[aspen]]. There is almost no logging nowadays and the forests are being restored, especially around Moscow.

[[Swamp]]s are prevalent in the eastern areas, such as [[Shatursky District|Shatursky]] and [[Lukhovitsky District]]s. The natural floodplain meadows are almost gone. The number of native plant species is reduced, but some foreign species flourish, such as [[Acer saccharum|Canadian maple]]. Endemic species include [[water caltrop]] and [[Cypripedium calceolus|lady's slipper]].

===Fauna===

In the oblast, there are more than a dozen kinds of bat and moth.<ref name=t>Tourov SS, Wildlife of Podmoskovie, Moscow, 1961</ref>

There are more than 170 species of birds in the area with large numbers of crows, sparrows, ducks, magpies, woodpeckers, [[thrush (bird)|thrushes]], [[Bonasa|grouses]], [[bullfinch]]es, [[nightingale]]s, [[Corn crake|corncrakes]], [[northern lapwing]]s, [[white stork]]s, [[grey heron]]s, seagulls and [[grebe]]s. Over forty species are being hunted.<ref name=t/>

Rivers and lakes of Moscow Oblast are rich in fish, such as [[ruffe]], [[carp]], [[bream]], [[bass (fish)|bass]], [[Rutilus|roaches]], [[Chinese sleeper]], [[perch]] and [[pike (fish)|pike]]. There are six species of reptiles: three lizards ([[Anguis fragilis|slowworm]], [[viviparous lizard]] and [[sand lizard]]) and three snakes ([[Vipera berus|European adder]], [[grass snake]] and [[Coronella|smooth snake]]). There is evidence for [[bog turtle]]s in some areas. [[Amphibians]] are represented by 11 species including [[smooth newt]], [[great crested newt]], [[common toad]], [[European green toad]], [[common frog]], [[moor frog]], [[marsh frog]], [[Pelobates fuscus|common spadefoot]] and [[European fire-bellied toad]].

===Environment===
The ecological situation in the Moscow Oblast is serious. The areas adjacent to Moscow, and industrial zones in the east and south-east regions are heavily polluted. Most contamination originates from emissions from [[Kashira Power Plant|Kashira]] and [[Shatura Power Station]]s and disposal of household and industrial waste. For example, the Timohovskaya dump is one of the largest in Europe; other objects of concern are aging oil storage tanks, and nuclear waste in the [[Sergiyevo-Posadsky District]]. Contamination level is highest in Moscow, Voskresensk and Klin, high in [[Dzerzhinsky, Moscow Oblast|Dzerzhinsky]], [[Kolomna]], [[Mytishchi]], [[Podolsk]], [[Serpukhov]], [[Shchyolkovo]], and [[Elektrostal]], and low in Prioksko-Terrasny Biosphere Reserve.<ref name="ekoport">{{cite web|url = http://www.ecomo.ru/index.php?go=Pages&in=view&id=1961|title = Ecological portal Moscow Region|access-date = August 10, 2009|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081006170221/http://www.ecomo.ru/index.php?go=Pages|archive-date = October 6, 2008|df = mdy-all}}</ref> The major contaminants are [[formaldehyde]] and [[phenol]] in Moscow; [[ammonia]] and [[hydrogen fluoride]]

[[File:Battle of Borodino panorama fragment 1.jpg|thumb|830px|Section of the panorama of the Battle of Borodino by [[Franz Roubaud]] (1912)]]
The territory of what is now Moscow Oblast had been inhabited for more than twenty thousand years. Numerous mounds and settlements from [[Iron Age]] were discovered there. Up to the 9–10th centuries, the Moskva River basin and adjacent lands were inhabited by [[Finnic peoples]]. [[Slavs]] populated the area only in the 10th century. In mid-12th century, the lands became part of [[Vladimir-Suzdal|Vladimir-Suzdal Principality]]. Several important cities were founded around that time, including [[Volokolamsk]] (1135), Moscow (1147), [[Zvenigorod]] (1152), and [[Dmitrov]] (1154). In the first half of the 13th century, the entire Vladimir-Suzdal Principality, including the Moscow area, was [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|conquered]] by the Mongols.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moskvaobl.ru/volokolamsck-history/ |title=History of Volokolamsk |access-date=2010-07-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221215946/http://www.moskvaobl.ru/volokolamsck-history/ |archive-date=February 21, 2011 |df=mdy-all}}. moskvaobl.ru (in Russian)</ref>
[[File:Lissner TroiceSergievaLavr.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sergius of Radonezh]] blesses Dmitry Donskoy, before the Battle of Kulikovo]]

In the 13th century, the land around Moscow was part of [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]], which subsequently was the center of the unification of Russian lands, in particular the Mongol raids. In 1380, from Kolomna the prince [[Dmitry Donskoy]] led his troops to defeat the Mongols at the [[Battle of Kulikovo]]. The southern part of Moscow Oblast was then part of the [[Principality of Ryazan]]; it was attached to Moscow only in the 1520.<ref>[http://www.moskvaobl.ru/his/ History of Moscow Oblast] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014134338/http://www.moskvaobl.ru/his/ |date=October 14, 2013}} moskvaobl.ru (in Russian)</ref>

In 1708, [[Moscow Governorate]] was established by the decree of [[Peter the Great]]; the area included most of the present Moscow Oblast. The [[Battle of Borodino]], which decided the outcome of the [[French invasion of Russia]] was fought in 1812 near [[Mozhaysk]].

Industries developed in Moscow Oblast in the 17–19th centuries.<ref name=brit /> They were centered in [[Noginsk|Bogorodsk]], [[Pavlovsky Posad]], and [[Orekhovo-Zuyevo]] and were dominated by textile production. The first railway in Russia was constructed in the Moscow Oblast in 1851, connecting Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg]], and in 1862 the line to [[Nizhny Novgorod]] was opened.

In the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], ''Central Industrial Oblast'' was established on January&nbsp;14, 1929.<ref name="Established">''Administrative-Territorial Structure of the Union Republics. 1987.'', p.&nbsp;179</ref> It included the abolished [[Moscow Governorate|Moscow]], [[Ryazan Governorate|Ryazan]], [[Tver Governorate|Tver]], [[Tula Governorate|Tula]], [[Vladimir Governorate|Vladimir]], and [[Kaluga Governorate]]s. The oblast was divided into ten [[okrug]]s and had the administrative center in Moscow. On June&nbsp;3, 1929, the area was renamed ''Moscow Oblast'' and on July&nbsp;30, 1930, the division into ten okrugs was abolished.<ref name=h1 /><ref name=h2 />

Parts of the then bulky ''Moscow Oblast'' were gradually transferred to other divisions. In particular, twenty-six districts became part of Kalinin Oblast in January 1935, and another seventy-seven districts were separated in September 1937 as [[Tula Oblast|Tula]] and [[Ryazan Oblast]]s. [[Borovsky District|Borovsky]], {{ill|Vysokinichsky District|ru|Высокиничский район}}, [[Maloyaroslavetsky District|Maloyaroslavetsky]], [[Ugodsko-Zavodsky District|Ugodsko-Zavodsky]], and [[Petushinsky District]]s were transferred in 1944 to Kaluga and Vladimir Oblasts.<ref name=h1>[http://www.mosoblrosto.ru/istoria.html Pages of History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926125026/http://www.mosoblrosto.ru/istoria.html |date=September 26, 2018}} Moscow Oblast (in Russian)</ref><ref name=h2>[http://www.mosoblrosto.ru/istoria.html History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926125026/http://www.mosoblrosto.ru/istoria.html |date=September 26, 2018}} Official site of Moscow Oblast (in Russian)</ref>

In 1941 and 1942, one of the most significant military operations of [[World War II]]—the [[Battle of Moscow]]—was fought in the Moscow Oblast. Germany reached Solnechnogorsky, Klinsky, Istrinsky, Lobninsky, Khimkinsky, Naro-Fominsky, Volokolamsky, Kolomensky, Kashirsky, Serybryano-Prudsky Districts and others.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

According to the [[Constitution of Russia]], adopted in December 1993, Moscow Oblast is one of the 83 [[federal subjects of Russia]].

===Industry===
[[File:Soyuz TMA-6 spacecraft.jpg|thumb|[[Soyuz-TMA]]-6 spacecraft developed by [[S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia|Energia]]]]

In terms of industrial production, Moscow Oblast is second in Russia, after the city of Moscow. The industry of the Oblast relies on imported raw materials, strong scientific and technological base and highly skilled workforce; it is closely linked with the industry of Moscow.

Well developed are machinery and metalworking. There are plants for the thermal and nuclear power engineering ([[ZiO-Podolsk]] in [[Podolsk]]), nuclear fuel ([[TVEL]] in [[Elektrostal]]), space and missile ([[S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia|Energia]] in [[Korolyov (city)|Korolyov]], [[Lavochkin]] in [[Khimki]], NGO engineering in [[Reutov]], FTSDT "Union" in [[Dzerzhinsky, Moscow Oblast|Dzerzhinsky]]&nbsp;– development of solid rocket fuel, etc., IBC "Horizon" in [[Dzerzhinsky (town)|Dzerzhinsky]]&nbsp;– power plants for aircraft, etc.); locomotives ([[Kolomna Locomotive Works|Kolomna factory]]), metro cars ([[Metrowagonmash]] in [[Mytischi]]), electric trains (Demikhovsky Engineering Works), cars ([[SeAZ]]), buses (Likinsky bus plant in [[Likino-Dulyovo]]); agricultural machines, excavators and cranes ([[Lyubertsy]], [[Dmitrov]], [[Balashikha]]); stainless steel ([[Elektrostal]]), cables ([[Podolsk]]), optical devices (Krasnogorsky plant, Lytkarino Optical Glass Factory).

There are many defense enterprises, such as Russian Center for demonstrations of weapons, military equipment and technology in [[Krasnoarmeysk, Moscow Oblast|Krasnoarmeysk]]; [[Kamov]], [[Phazotron]], [[Bazalt]], [[NPP Zvezda]], [[MKB Fakel]], [[MKB Raduga]], National Research Institute of Aviation Systems, Krasnozavodsk Chemical Plant, [[Tikhomirov Scientific Research Institute of Instrument Design]], Moscow Research Institute "Agat", [[Dolgoprudnenskoe Scientific Production Plant]], and many others.

Chemical industry of the Oblast produces acids ([[Shchyolkovo]]), mineral fertilizers (plants named "Phosphates" and "Mineral fertilizers" in [[Voskresensk, Moscow Oblast|Voskresensk]]), synthetic fibers ([[Serpukhov]] and [[Klin, Klinsky District, Moscow Oblast|Klin]]), plastics ([[Orekhovo-Zuyevo]]), varnishes and paints (Sergiyev Posad, Odintsovsky paint factories), pharmaceuticals ([[Staraya Kupavna]]).

===Energy===
[[File:Kashira Power Plant (01).jpg|thumb|The largest source of electricity in the Moscow region – [[Kashira Power Plant]]]]

In 1999, Moscow Oblast consumed 15.4 billion m<sup>3</sup> of natural gas, 3.32 million tonnes of oil, 2.13 million tonnes of coal and 8.5 billion kWh of electricity. Electricity for the Oblast is provided by the [[Kashirskaya thermal power plant]] (TPP, 1910 MW), Dzerzhynskaya TPP No 22 (1300 MW), [[Thermal Power Plant 27]] (1100 MW), [[Shatura Power Station]] (1100 MW), Zagorskaya [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power plant]] (1200 MW), Elektrogorsk TPP (623 MW) and several smaller plants. Major new energy project in the region is the construction of Zagorsk hydroelectric plant with the capacity of 840 MW. The deficit of energy is provided by powerlines connecting the region with Saint Petersburg, [[Volga Hydroelectric Station]] and other energy suppliers.<ref>[http://allrussiatv.ru/mosobl/economics/ Economics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024205604/http://allrussiatv.ru/mosobl/economics/ |date=October 24, 2010}} (in Russian)</ref>

===Agriculture===
Agriculture has a relatively minor role in the economy of the Oblast. Only 25% of land is cultivated and another 15% are used for other activities such as [[livestock]] farming. Agriculture is the least developed in the northern, eastern and western border regions. In the southern region, especially south of the Oka River, more than 50% of land is used in agriculture. [[Horticulture]] is typical for the southern region with most of the sown area (more than 3/5) occupied by forage crops. Large areas are reserved for grains, especially wheat, [[barley]], [[oats]] and [[rye]], and significant role plays potato. Greenhouses are very common and [[Moskovsky, Moscow Oblast|Moskovsky]] city hosts the largest greenhouse complex in Europe. Also grown are [[flowers]] and [[mushroom]]s. [[Livestock]] farming predominates over the crop, and is primarily aimed at the production of milk and meat. In addition to cattle, commonly bred are pigs and chickens.<ref name=brit/>

The economic crisis of the 1990s in Russia had severely affected the agriculture of Moscow Oblast. In particular, in the 2000s, as compared with 1970–80s, the grain production has fallen by more than 3 times; potatoes by 2.5 times; vegetables, livestock and poultry by 30%; milk by 2 times and eggs by 4 times.<ref>Russian Statistical Yearbook, 2005, average for each category over 1970–1980</ref><ref>Russian Statistical Yearbook, 2009, average over 2001–2008</ref>

===Transport===
[[File:Sluice nr3 - Moscow Canal.jpg|thumb|The gateway to the [[Moscow Canal]] in [[Yakhroma]]]]
Moscow Oblast has a dense transport network, including roads, railways and waterways along the largest rivers, lakes and reservoirs. Land routes are radially diverging from Moscow and crossed by one railway and [[MKAD|two highway]] rings. Neither railways nor roads, built for the most part many years ago, can cope with the steadily mounting traffic flows. About half of the roads are overloaded and three quarters do not meet modern requirements. Insufficient width of the roads and frequent repairs cause traffic jams.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alldoma.ru/novosti-maloetazhnogo-stroitelstva/moskovskiy-transportnyiy-uzel.html |title=Московский транспортный узел – что будет дальше (Moscow transport hub – what next) |access-date=2010-07-08 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927183258/http://www.alldoma.ru/novosti-maloetazhnogo-stroitelstva/moskovskiy-transportnyiy-uzel.html |archive-date=September 27, 2008 |df=mdy-all}}.

Moscow Oblast has the highest density of railways in Russia. Eleven major radial lines originate in Moscow and run through the Oblast; the total length of the railways reaches 2,700&nbsp;km. Almost all railroads are electrified. The largest rail hubs are [[Orekhovo-Zuyevo]] and [[Bekasovo, Moscow Oblast|Bekasovo]]. Regular navigation is carried on the rivers Volga, Oka and Moscow, as well as on the [[Moscow Canal]]. Major river ports are in Serpukhov and Kolomna. Also well-developed is pipeline transport. There are two major oil lines, two natural gas rings and numerous radial lines connecting Moscow with the largest gas producing regions of the country.<ref>[http://www.mostransgaz.info/ "Mostransgaz"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912035825/http://www.mostransgaz.info/ |date=September 12, 2017}}.
