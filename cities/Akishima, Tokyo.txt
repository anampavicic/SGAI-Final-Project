==History==
The area of present-day Akishima was part of ancient [[Musashi Province]], and a center for [[sericulture]]. In the post–[[Meiji Restoration]] cadastral reform of July 22, 1878, the area became part of [[Kitatama District, Tokyo|Kitatama District]] in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]].  Haiji, Nakagami, and Sotoyatsu villages were created on April 1, 1889, with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. The entire district was transferred to the control of Tokyo Metropolis on April 1, 1893. The latter two villages merged on January 1, 1928, to form Shōwa Village. Following the dedication of Tachikawa Airfield, which was established in 1922, the surrounding area developed in the 1930s with large-scale munitions factories for aircraft manufacturing for the [[Imperial Japanese Army]].

Shōwa was elevated to town status on January 1, 1941, and through merger with the village of Haiji on May 1, 1954, became the city of Akishima. The name comes from the ''[[kun'yomi]]'' of the first ''[[kanji]]'' in the name of the former town of Shōwa, and the ''[[on'yomi]]'' of the second ''kanji'' in the name of the former village of Haijima.

==Government==
Akishima has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 22 members. Akishima contributes one member to the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of [[Tokyo 25th district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Akishima was developed as an industrial suburb of Tokyo, and still has large factories operated by [[Hoya Corporation]], [[JEOL]], [[Japan Aviation Electronics]], [[Fostex]], Shōwa Aircraft Industry Co., and others. The city is also a [[bedroom community]] for the Tokyo metropolitan area.
