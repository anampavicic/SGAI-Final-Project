The '''Saladin''', '''Salah ad Din''', or '''Salah Al-Din Governorate''' ({{langx|ar|محافظة صلاح الدين}}, {{translit|ar|Muḥāfaẓat Ṣalāḥ al-Dīn}}) is one of [[Iraq]]'s 19 [[Governorates of Iraq|governorates]], north of [[Baghdad]]. It has an area of {{convert|24363|km2|sqmi}}, with an estimated population of 1,042,200 people in 2003. It is made up of 8 districts, with the capital being [[Tikrit]]. Before 1976 the governorate was part of [[Baghdad Governorate]].

The governorate is named after the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] [[Islam|Muslim]] leader [[Saladin]] or Salah ad Din, who hailed from the governorate. This Sunni-dominated governorate is also known as the home of [[Saddam Hussein]], who hailed from the village of [[Al-Awja]]. Salah Al-Din governorate, a traditional stronghold of Saddam and his [[Al-Bu Nasir (Iraqi tribe)|Al-Bu Nasir tribe]] that is located in the heart of the [[Sunni Triangle]], has been rocked by [[Iraqi insurgency (2003–2011)|insurgencies]], sectarian violence and tribal rivalries ever since Coalition forces invaded Iraq in 2003.<ref>{{Cite web |date=24 January 2007 |title=Iraq: No end to violence in Saddam's home province |url=https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/iraq-no-end-violence-saddams-home-province |website=ReliefWeb}}</ref>

==Overview==
[[File:Samara spiralovity minaret rijen1973.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Malwiya minaret at the [[Great Mosque of Samarra]]]]
Saladin Governorate contains a number of important religious and cultural sites. [[Samarra]], the governorate's largest city, is home to both the [[Al-Askari Shrine]] (an important religious site in [[Shia Islam]] where the 10th and 11th [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Shia Imam]]s are buried), and the [[Great Mosque of Samarra]] with its distinctive Malwiya minaret. It also contains an old [[Zengid]] mosque.

Samarra was the capital of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in the 9th century CE, and today [[Abbasid Samarra]] is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. 

The ancient [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] Assyrian city of [[Assur]] is located in [[Al-Shirqat District]] on the banks of the [[Tigris River]]. Other sites in the governorate include the Crusader Dome (القبة الصلبية) north of Samarra and the Al-`Ashaq Palace (قصر العاشق). Today, the Saladin Governorate has a diverse population of [[Arabs]], [[Kurds]], [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkmens]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]].

In January 2014, there were plans announced by Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]] to make the Tuz Khurmatu district into a new governorate due to its [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkmen]] majority.<ref>{{cite news |title=Iraqi Council of Ministers approved new provinces of Tuz Khurmatu and Tal Afar |url=http://www.ekurd.net/mismas/articles/misc2014/1/kurdsiniraq218.htm |newspaper=Kurd Net |date=21 January 2014 |access-date=23 August 2014}}</ref> However, these plans were not implemented.<ref>See for example the following newspaper article from July 2015, which refers to Tuz Khurmatu as part of Saldin Governorate. {{Cite web |title=محتجون يتظاهرون في طوزخورماتو ضد القصف التركي |trans-title=Protestors demonstrate in Tuz Khurmatu |work=شفق نيوز |access-date=2015-07-30 |url=http://www.ara.shafaaq.com/21115 |language=ar}}</ref>

==Autonomy==
In October 2011, the governorate's administration declared itself a semi-autonomous region, explaining that the declaration was in response to the [[Government of Iraq|central government]]'s "domination over the provincial council authorities".<ref name=Mcclatchy>{{cite web |last=Hammoudi |first=Laith |title=Saddam's home province declares regional autonomy in Iraq |date=27 October 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210154253/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2011/10/27/128503/saddams-home-province-declares.html|archive-date=10 December 2011|
