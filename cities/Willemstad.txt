'''Willemstad''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɪ|l|ə|m|s|t|ɑː|t|,_|ˈ|v|ɪ|l|-}} {{respell|WIL|əm|staht|,_|VIL|-}}, {{IPA|nl|ˈʋɪləmstɑt|lang|nl-Willemstad.ogg}}, {{IPA|pap|wiləmˈstad|lang}}; {{literal translation|[[William I of the Netherlands|William]] Town}}) is the [[capital city|capital]] and largest city of [[Curaçao]], an [[island]] in the southern [[Caribbean Sea]] that is a [[Countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands|constituent country]] of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. It was the capital of the [[Netherlands Antilles]] prior to that entity's [[Dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles|dissolution in 2010]]. The historic centre of the city consists of four quarters: the Punda and [[Otrobanda]], which are separated by the [[Sint Anna Bay]], an inlet that leads into the large natural harbour called the Schottegat, as well as the [[Scharloo]] and [[Pietermaai Smal]] quarters, which are across from each other on the smaller Waaigat harbour. Willemstad is home to the [[Curaçao synagogue]], the oldest surviving synagogue in the Americas. The city centre, with its unique architecture and harbour entry, has been designated a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

==History==
Punda was established in 1634, when the [[Dutch West India Company]] captured the island from Spain. The original name of Punda was ''de punt'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. The city was constructed as a walled city.<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=https://www.curacaohistory.com/1861-pietermaai-suburb |title=Pietermaai Suburb|website=Curaçao History|access-date=18 April 2021}}</ref> It soon developed into one of the major centres of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] which triggered a rapid population growth.{{sfn|Benjamins|Snelleman|1917|p=747|loc={{sp}}}} In 1674, the [[Curaçao synagogue]] was built by [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Sephardic Portuguese Jews]] from Amsterdam and Recife, Brazil who had settled in the city as traders.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Curacao.html|title=Curacao Virtual Jewish History Tour|website=Jewish Library|accessdate=22 April 2021}}</ref> In the late 17th century, there were over 200 houses within the city walls.<ref name="history"/>

In 1675, it was decided to construct the town of [[Pietermaai]] outside of the enclosed city. It was to be separated from the city by an area of about 500 metres in which construction was not allowed so as not to obstruct the cannons in [[Fort Amsterdam (Curaçao)|Fort Amsterdam]].<ref name="gids">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_gid001199001_01/_gid001199001_01_0106.php |title=Architectuur en monumentenzorg |author=Michael A. Newton |year=1990|magazine=De Gids|language=nl|page=658}}</ref> In 1707, the suburb of [[Otrobanda]] was founded. Otrobanda would become the cultural centre of Willemstad. Its name originated from the [[Papiamento|Papiamentu]] ''otro banda'', which means "the opposite side".{{sfn|Benjamins|Snelleman|1917|p=747|ps=: Dutch: Overzijde English: Opposite side}} The suburb of [[Scharloo]] followed, however Willemstad continued to experience growth.{{sfn|Benjamins|Snelleman|1917|p=747|loc={{sp}}}} By 1818, the population of Willemstad had grown to 9,536 people.{{sfn|Benjamins|Snelleman|1917|p=749}} On 13 May 1861, a decision was made to demolish the city walls, and build residential houses in the gap separating Willemstad from Pietermaai.{{sfn|Benjamins|Snelleman|1917|p=747|loc={{sp}}}}

Around 1925, the booming oil and phosphate industry further stimulated growth, and resulted in the creation of new neighbourhoods.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gobiernu.cw/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Buurtprofiel_Steenrijk_.pdf |title=Buurtprofiel Steenrijk|last1=Buurtprofiel Steenrijk|year=2011|website=Government of Curaçao|language=nl|page=9|access-date=22 April 2021}}</ref> Between 1945 and 1955, [[Julianadorp, Curaçao|Julianadorp]] and [[Emmastad]] were created by [[Royal Dutch Shell]] to house the new workers.<ref name="archief">{{cite web|url=https://www.nationaalarchief.cw/collectie/exposities/oliedorpen |title=Ontwikkeling huisvesting op Curaçao door Shell|website=National Archive of Curaçao|access-date=20 April 2021|language=nl}}</ref>  In 1985, the oil refinery which employed 12,000 people was closed down by Shell. The Government of Curaçao decided to buy the refinery for ƒ 1.00 and take responsibility for all future pollution claims.

On 30 May 1969, the [[1969 Curaçao uprising|Curaçao uprising]], a strike at a subcontractor of the oil refinery, turned into a riot. The riot resulted in two deaths, 300 arrests and a part of the historic centre being burnt down. The [[Netherlands Marine Corps]] was sent to Willemstad and the entire city centre was closed down.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/beleven/nieuws/curacao-trinta-di-mei |title=Curaçao Trinta di Mèi|website=Dutch National Archive|access-date=22 April 2021|language=nl}}</ref> In 1997, the centre of Willemstad and its former suburbs were designated a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].<ref name="heritage">{{cite web|url=https://news.curacao.com/historische-wijken/ |title=Historische Wijken|website=Curacao.com|access-date=22 April 2021}}</ref> In the 21st century, a largescale program of renovation started.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gobiernu.cw/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Buurtprofiel_Scharloo_drukker.pdf |title=Buurtprofiel Scharloo|last1=Buurtprofiel Scharloo|year=2011|website=Government of Curaçao|language=nl|page=10|access-date=22 April 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dolfijngo.com/en/travel/must-see/pietermaai-district-curacao/|title=The local SOHO on Curaçao:The Pietermaai District|website=Dolfijn Go|access-date=22 April 2021}}</ref>
