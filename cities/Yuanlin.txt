'''Yuanlin''' ([[Hokkien]] [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī|POJ]]: ''Oân-lîm'') is a [[county-administered city]] in eastern [[Changhua County]], [[Taiwan]]. It is the second largest settlement in the county, after the county seat of [[Changhua City]].

==History==
The land around Yuanlin was cleared of trees and bushes, and fitted for cultivation since the [[Yongzheng Emperor|Yongzheng era]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] (1723–1735). It was well developed about the 16th year of the [[Qianlong Emperor|Qianlong era]]. At first, people cut down the surrounding forests to build their houses. Gradually, only the round woodland was left, and the town was named {{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|圓|林|仔}}}} ({{zh|poj=Oân-nâ-á}}), meaning "the round woodland." Later the characters were changed to {{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|員}}林}} (Yuanlin). Yuanlin produces different kinds of fruits, and [[succade]] (fruit cooked in sugar syrup and encrusted with a sugar crystals) is one of its specialties.

===Republic of China===
After the [[Retrocession Day|handover of Taiwan from Japan]] to the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in 1945, Yuanlin was made the capital of the newly established [[Taichung County]]. In 1950, [[Changhua County|Changhua]] and [[Nantou County|Nantou]] were separated from the county to form new counties. Being in Changhua County, Yuanlin ceased becoming the capital of Taichung County, and the new capital of Taichung County was given to [[Fengyuan District|Fengyuan Township]]. On 8 August 2015, Yuanlin was upgraded from an [[Township (Taiwan)|urban township]] into a county-administered city<ref name=upgrade>{{cite web |script-title=zh:員林鎮走入歷史！彰化縣公告8月8日改為「員林市」|url=http://www.ettoday.net/news/20150729/542126.htm#ixzz3i5eN6kNz|website=ettoday.net|date=29 July 2015 |publisher=ETtoday|access-date=8 August 2015}}</ref> after the qualifying population level for city status was revised downwards from 125,000 to 100,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://glin.ly.gov.tw/file/legal/tw1706201507.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414035954/https://glin.ly.gov.tw/file/legal/tw1706201507.pdf|archive-date=2021-04-14|title=總統府公報 第 7198 號|access-date=2023-08-27|language=zh}}</ref>

Wu was subsequently sentenced to 14 years in prison, having been found guilty of exacting bribes in excess of NT$16 million from 81 different projects since 2005. Officials from the [[Control Yuan]] said the scope of Wu's activities was "unprecedented" and that "virtually no construction projects in the town were untainted by corruption".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2011/new/apr/14/today-p6.htm|title=Every Case Corrupt: Yuanlin Mayor Wu Zongxian Impeached|publisher=[[Liberty Times]]|access-date=2011-08-08}}</ref>

[[File:Yuanlin Station 20150425.jpg|thumb|[[Yuanlin Station]]]]
Yuanlin has a [[Yuanlin Station|station]] on the [[Taiwan Railways Administration]]'s [[Western Line, Taiwan|Western Line]]. A project is underway to redevelop the station in combination with converting the current at-grade line to an elevated line through the city, a plan designed to improve road traffic flow and promote investment. The elevation of the track will eliminate three level crossings and five underpasses, and the area currently comprising the station will be converted into a [[mixed-use development]] with commercial space, parking and green space. This redevelopment was scheduled to be completed in 2013 and has a budget of [[NT$]]4 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rrb.gov.tw/04100.aspx?id=6&lan=ch|title=Yuanlin Plan|language=zh|publisher=Railway Reconstruction Bureau|access-date=2011-02-01}}</ref>
