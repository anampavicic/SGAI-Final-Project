'''Taloqan''' ({{langx|fa|تالقان}}, also transcribed '''Taleqan''' or '''Taluqan''') is the capital of [[Takhar Province]], in northeastern [[Afghanistan]]. It is located in the [[Taluqan District]]. The population was estimated as 196,400 in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&men=gpro&lng=en&dat=32&geo=-13&srt=npan&col=aohdq&pt=c&va=&geo=456252953|title= Tāloqān|access-date= 2007-12-19|publisher= World Gazetteer|archive-url= https://archive.today/20130105120532/http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&men=gpro&lng=en&dat=32&geo=-13&srt=npan&col=aohdq&pt=c&va=&geo=456252953|archive-date= 2013-01-05|url-status= dead}}</ref>

In 2021, the [[Taliban]] gained control of the province during the [[2021 Taliban offensive]].

==History==
[[File:Khwarezmshahs jital 1200-1220 Taliqan.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A coin minted in Taloqan under [[Muhammad II of Khwarezm]] (1200–1220).]]
The old city to the west on the riverside was described by [[Marco Polo]] in 1275 [[Common Era|CE]] as:

:"a castle called Taikhan, where there is a great corn-market, and the country round is fine and fruitful. The hills that lie to the south of it are large and lofty. They all consist of white salt, extremely hard, with which the people for a distance of thirty days' journey round, come to provide themselves, for it is esteemed the purest that is found in the world. It is so hard, that it can be broken only with great iron hammers. The quantity is so great that all the countries of the earth might be supplied from thence."<ref>{{cite book |last= Dupree|first= Nancy Hatch|title= An Historical Guide to Afghanistan|orig-year= 1st Edition: 1970|edition= 2nd Edition, Revised and Enlarged|year= 1977|publisher= Afghan Tourist Organization}}</ref>

In 1603, Taloqan ("Talhan") was visited by another European explorer, [[Bento de Góis]], who was traveling with a caravan from [[Kabul]] to [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]] (then the capital of [[Kashgar]]ia).<ref>"The Journey of Benedict Goës from Agra to Cathay" - [[Henry Yule]]'s translation of the relevant chapters of ''[[De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas]]'', with detailed notes and an introduction.

The [[mujahideen]] headquarters of [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] were located in Taloqan during his campaign against the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet Army]] and the [[Taliban]]. Taloqan was the last major city to fall to the [[Taliban]], on 5 September 2000,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.refworld.org/docid/3c84d9a14.html|title=U.S. Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices 2001 - Afghanistan|publisher=United States Department of State|date=4 March 2002|access-date=2 October 2020|archive-date=9 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201009054122/https://www.refworld.org/docid/3c84d9a14.html|url-status=live}}</ref> after a siege which claimed the lives of hundreds of civilians.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.e-ariana.com/ariana/eariana.nsf/7eca40d3d348841987256b79007d1cb8/05a2b19f9a3171e987256c4a005c8f1a?OpenDocument|title= Amid the ruins of war, Afghans tread warily|last= Filipov|first= David|date= 2002-10-06|publisher= [[The Boston Globe]]|access-date= 2007-12-19|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090805073818/http://www.e-ariana.com/ariana/eariana.nsf/7eca40d3d348841987256b79007d1cb8/05a2b19f9a3171e987256c4a005c8f1a?OpenDocument|archive-date= 2009-08-05}}</ref> A bloody capture by the Taliban also triggered a mass exodus in the population, with civilians fleeing towards [[Imam Sahib]] and the [[Panjshir Valley]]. [[Northern Alliance]] soldiers managed to stop the Taliban advance to the north and to the east of the city, but weren't able to retake it. Taloqan was liberated in November 2001 by Northern Alliance soldiers following the [[United States invasion of Afghanistan]]. 

The city was attacked during the [[2021 Taliban offensive]] (which coincided with the [[Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020–2021)|withdrawal of United States troops]]). 

On May 2, 2021, PiramQul Ziayi, the most influential anti-Taliban figure in Takhar, was assassinated in Rustaq district.[https://8am.af/eng/the-collapse-of-the-anti-taliban-resistance-obstacle-beyond-kokcha-who-was-piramqul-ziayi-and-how-was-he-killed/]

Following the fall of several districts of Takhar to the Taliban,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://pajhwok.com/2021/06/20/taliban-overrun-4-districts-of-takhar-say-sources/ | title=Taliban overrun 4 districts of Takhar, say sources | date=20 June 2021 | last1=Kakar | first1=Ajmal }}</ref> on June 20, 2021, a group of Takhar elders Including Mohibullah Noori one of Takhar elders and Ashraf Ani a member of Parliament announced at a press conference in Kabul that they will send a group to mobilize people resistant in support of security forces in Takhar.

==Taloqan in Islamic sources==
The testament of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] indicates that the city will play a major role regarding the [[Mahdi]]. A narration by chain, [[Imam Baqir]] states: "Allah Almighty has a treasure in Talaqan which is of neither gold nor silver, but consists of twelve thousand (people), having 'Ahmad, Ahmad' for their slogan. They will be led by a young Hashemite man riding a gray mule and wearing a red headband. It is as if I can see him crossing the Euphrates. Should you hear of his coming, rush to him even if you have to crawl over the snow<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://sahabatnabi.0catch.com/imammahdi3.htm |title=Al Mahdi |access-date=2011-08-13 |archive-date=2012-03-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330174931/http://sahabatnabi.0catch.com/imammahdi3.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Another narration states: "Talaqan is a place of treasures of Allah. These treasures are not of gold and silver, but consist of people who have recognised Allah as they should have."<ref>Al-Muttaqi al-Hindi, al-Burhan fee Alamat al-Mahdi Akhir az-Zaman, p.&nbsp;59)</ref>
