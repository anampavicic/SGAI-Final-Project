'''Khimki''' ({{langx|ru|Химки}}, {{IPA|ru|ˈxʲimkʲɪ|IPA}}) is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] in [[Moscow Oblast]], Russia. It is located approximately {{convert|18|km}} northwest from central [[Moscow]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.distance.to/Khimki/Moscow |title=Distance from Khimki to Moscow |website=Distance calculator |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111193943/http://distancescalculator.net/khimki-moscow-oblast-russia-to-moscow-russia?m=dd&tm=5&el=false&latlngs=(55.8940553,37.443948699999964);(55.755826,37.6173)&c1=true&c2=false&c3=false&c4=false&c5=true&c6=false&c7=true&c8=false&c9=true&c10=false|archive-date=November 11, 2016|access-date=November 11, 2016}}</ref> and is part of the [[Moscow metropolitan area]].

The city of Khimki is attached to the city of Moscow and has a border with it.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mapa MICHELIN Khimki - plan Khimki - ViaMichelin |url=https://www.viamichelin.pl/web/Mapy-plany/Mapa_plan-Khimki-141400-Moskovskaja_oblast-Russia |access-date=2024-10-16 |website=www.viamichelin.pl |language=pl}}</ref>

==History==
===Origins and formation===
Khimki was initially a railway station that existed since 1850 on the [[Moscow – Saint Petersburg Railway]]. The [[Moskva-Volga Canal]] was constructed between 1932 and 1937 on which Khimki lies on the west bank. Khimki was then officially founded in 1939.<ref>[http://okrussia.ru/city/15 Город Химки, Московская область]{{in lang|ru}}</ref>

===Khimki in the Battle of Moscow===
The German attack starting the [[Battle of Moscow]] (code-named 'Operation Typhoon') began on 2 October 1941. The attack on a broad front brought German forces to occupy the village of Krasnaya Polyana (now in the town of [[Lobnya]]) to Moscow's North West. Krasnaya Polyana was taken on 30 November.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olYUrlIfWg0 43 mins 45 secs into this "The World at War2 Episode 5"</ref>

Many sources state that at least one German army patrol visited Khimki. Similarly many sources state this as the closest point the Germans reached to Moscow (Khimki at the time was 8 km (almost 4 or 5 mi),<ref>https://www.bahesab.ir/calc/km/</ref> from the edge of Moscow). Among the sources stating the Germans visited Khimki the details of the date and unit involved are inconsistent and disputed. One story of events asserts a skirmish took place in Khimki on 16 October at the Leningradskoe Shosse bridge involving a German motorcycle unit,<ref>[http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?f=55&t=194166 Axis History]</ref> but this would have been far from the main body of German forces at that time. Another account is a patrol reached Khimki around 30 November or early December before returning to its main unit without combat. The dates mentioned for this second account vary.<ref>[http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=23260&start=15 Axis History]</ref> A myth{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} surrounding this is that the Germans would have been able to see the [[Kremlin]] 19 kilometres in the distance from Khimki.

The Soviet Army counter offensive for "removing the immediate threat to Moscow" started on 5 December on the North-Western Front (the area around Khimki North West of Moscow). The South-Western Front and Western Fronts began their offensives on 6 December. The German forces were driven back. Moscow was never under such close land threat again during the war.

A memorial in the form of a giant tank trap is located at the "Kilometer 23" point {{coord|55|54|46.103|N|37|24|10.577|E|display=inline}}) of [[Leningradskoye Highway]] (the highway to St.&nbsp;Petersburg). The memorial is {{cvt|1.8|km}} south east of [[Molzhaninovo railway station]]. The memorial was unveiled on 6 December 1966 as a 25th anniversary recognition of the launch of the Soviet counter offensive. This location is just short of an intersection with the [[Moscow–St Petersburg railway]] (close to where the [[IKEA]] shopping centre has since been built). This memorial and shopping centre on the Northern side of Khimki has a direct distance of 22 kilometres from Moscow city centre. At the time of the conflict this location was outside Khimki. This memorial is different to the [[Khimki War Memorial]] moved in 2007 to  in Novoluzhinskoe cemetery.

===Post war===
Khimki was home to several Soviet aerospace defense development centers that became the principal employers for the majority of the city population. This included R&D enterprises which designed surface-to-air missiles for [[S-75 Dvina|S-75]], [[S-125]], [[S-200 Angara/Vega/Dubna|S-200]], [[S-300 (missile)|S-300]] Soviet air defense systems, engines for [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s and [[expendable launch system|satellite launch vehicles]], and other types of equipment. For this reason, Khimki was off limits for all foreigners visiting the country, despite its location on a highway between Moscow and its major international airport.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 2010 the city saw protests over the construction of the new [[Moscow–Saint Petersburg motorway]]  through the [[Khimki Forest]].<ref>

Population: 254,748 ([[Russian Census (2019)|2019 Census]]);<ref>[http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/doc_2019/bul_dr/mun_obr2019.rar Численность населения Российской Федерации по муниципальным образованиям на 1 января 2019 года]{{In lang|ru}}</ref> 207,425 ([[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Census]]);<ref name="2010Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2010Census}}</ref> 141,000 ([[Russian Census (2002)|2002 Census]]);<ref>{{ru-pop-ref|2002Census}}</ref> {{su-census1989|132,902|;}} 106,000 (1977); 23,000 (1939).{{Historical populations|3=1926|4=2876|5=1939|6=23092|7=1959|8=47800|9=1970|10=85000|11=1979|12=117974|13=1989|14=132902|15=2002|16=141000|17=2010|18=207425|19=2021|20=257128|type=|footnote=Source: Census data}}

==Politics==
Until 2001, the head of the [[:ru:Химкинский район|Khimki region]] was Yuri Korablin, and the vice-head was Sergei Krivorotenko. In 2001, Korablin became a deputy of the Moscow Oblast Duma, and his post was automatically taken by the vice-head. Unlike other municipalities in the Moscow Oblast, the charter of the Khimki district clearly provided for this option.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businesspress.ru/newspaper/article_mId_34_aId_279683.html |title=В ХИМКАХ НАХИМИЧИЛИ - Бизнес и криминал - Деловая пресса. Электронные газеты |language=ru |publisher=www.businesspress.ru |accessdate=2019-12-01}}</ref>

In September 2003, Sergei Krivorotenko disappeared from the administration. Subsequently, a criminal case was opened against him, and on 25 July 2006, he was arrested and soon convicted.<ref>[http://www.gzt.ru/topnews/accidents/-chinovnik-poplatilsya-za-zvezdu-rossii-/106422.html Чиновник поплатился за «Звезду России»], GZT.ru, 28.03.2007</ref>

In the elections on 7 December 2003, [[Vladimir Strelchenko]] was elected to the post of head of the Khimki district (20.0% of the votes, or 15,085);<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.admhimki.ru/news_12602_d04.03.2009.html |title=Итоги голосования на выборах Главы городского округа Химки 1 марта 2009 года |trans-title=Results of voting in the elections of the Head of the Khimki city district on March 1, 2009 |language=ru }}{{dead link|date=November 2023}}</ref> the vice-head was businessman Igor Belousov. Strelchenko was supported in the elections by the governor of the Moscow Oblast, [[Boris Gromov]]. The second candidate, Yevgeny Artamonov, received 16.8% of the vote (12,672).

In the 2009 elections, Vladimir Strelchenko was re-elected to the post of head of the Khimki urban district (50.4%, or 27,443). Igor Belousov also participated in the elections and scored 22.8% (12,401).

On 15 August 2012, Vladimir Strelchenko announced through the official website of the City Administration that he resigned, effective 17 August 2012. This information was confirmed by the Administration of the Governor of the Moscow Oblast.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://novostimo.ru/n/news/all/politics/3520 |title=Губернатор подтвердил отставки мэров Балашихи и Химок |trans-title=The governor confirmed the resignations of the mayors of Balashikha and Khimki |language=ru |publisher=NovostiMO }}{{dead link|date=November 2023}}</ref> Maria Kitaeva, the governor's adviser on information issues, told ITAR-TASS, "he wrote a letter of resignation of his own free will." The statement was written after Strelchenko's conversation with [[Sergei Shoigu]]. One of the reasons for the resignation of Vladimir Strelchenko was the appearance of compromising evidence on the [https://himkileaks.dreamwidth.org/ Himkileaks] website.

On 17 August 2012, First Deputy Head of Administration [[:ru:Шахов, Олег Фёдорович|Oleg Shakhov]] was appointed acting Head of the Khimki City District, having taken this position only two days earlier - on 15 August 2012. Before this, Shakhov worked as first deputy governor of the [[Tula Oblast]]. Having defeated opposition candidate [[Yevgeniya Chirikova]] in the elections held on 14 October 2012, Shakhov became the Head of the city district.

In November 2014, Oleg Shakhov was accused of fraud of 22 million rubles, after which he wrote a letter of resignation from the post of head of the city district, which was approved by the Council of Deputies of the city district. On 10 November 2014, Vladimir Sleptsov was appointed acting head of the Khimki administration, and in December of the same year he was confirmed as head of the district administration. On 14 November 2014, deputies of the Council of Deputies of the Khimki City District elected Alexander Dryannov as the new Head of the city district.

On 2 August 2016, Vladimir Sleptsov was appointed head of the Khimki city district. On 22 September 2016, Sleptsov resigned of his own free will. First Deputy Head of Administration Dmitry Voloshin was appointed acting head of the city district. In December 2016, by decision of the Council of Deputies, Dmitry Voloshin was elected head of the Khimki city district.
