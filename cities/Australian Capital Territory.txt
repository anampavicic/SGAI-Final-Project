The '''Australian Capital Territory''' ('''ACT'''), known as the '''Federal Capital Territory''' ('''FCT''') until 1938, is a [[federal territory]] of Australia. [[Canberra]], the capital city of Australia, is situated within the territory, and serves as the territory's [[primate city]]. It is located in southeastern [[Australian mainland]] as an [[enclave and exclave|enclave]] within the state of [[New South Wales]]. Founded after [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] as the [[seat of government]] for the new nation, the territory hosts the headquarters of all important institutions of the [[Australian Government]], most notably [[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]].

On 1 January 1901, [[Federation of Australia|federation of the colonies]] of Australia was achieved. Section 125 of the new [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] provided that land, situated in New South Wales and at least {{cvt|100|miles|km}} from [[Sydney]], would be ceded to the new [[Government of Australia|federal government]]. Following discussion and exploration of various areas within New South Wales, the ''[[Seat of Government Act 1908]]'' was passed in 1908 which specified a capital in the Yass-Canberra region. The territory was transferred to the federal government by [[New South Wales]] in 1911, two years prior to the capital city being founded and formally named as Canberra in 1913.

While the overwhelming majority of the population resides in the city of [[Canberra]] in the ACT's north-east, the territory also includes some towns such as [[Williamsdale, Australian Capital Territory|Williamsdale]], [[Oaks Estate, Australian Capital Territory|Oaks Estate]], [[Uriarra, Australian Capital Territory|Uriarra]], [[Tharwa, Australian Capital Territory|Tharwa]] and [[Hall, Australian Capital Territory|Hall]]. The ACT also includes the [[Namadgi National Park]], which comprises the majority of land area of the territory. Despite a common misconception, the [[Jervis Bay Territory]] is not part of the ACT, although the laws of the Australian Capital Territory apply as if Jervis Bay did form part of the ACT.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |url=https://regional.gov.au/territories/jervis_bay/governanceadministration.aspx |title=Jervis Bay Territory Governance and Administration |website=Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development |language=en-US |access-date=2019-04-08}}</ref> The territory has a relatively dry, continental climate, experiencing warm to hot summers and cool to cold winters.

The Australian Capital Territory is home to many important institutions of the federal government, national monuments and museums. These include the [[Parliament of Australia]], the [[High Court of Australia]], the [[Australian Defence Force Academy]] and the [[Australian War Memorial]]. It also hosts the majority of foreign embassies in Australia, as well as regional headquarters of many international organisations, not-for-profit groups, lobbying groups and professional associations. Several major universities also have campuses in the ACT, including the [[Australian National University]], the [[University of Canberra]], the [[University of New South Wales]], [[Charles Sturt University]] and the [[Australian Catholic University]].

[[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly|A locally elected legislative assembly]] has governed the territory since 1988. However, the Commonwealth maintains authority over the territory and may overturn local laws. It still maintains control over the area known as the [[Parliamentary Triangle, Canberra|Parliamentary Triangle]] through the [[National Capital Authority]]. Residents of the territory elect three members of the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and two [[Australian Senate|senators]].

With 453,324 residents, the Australian Capital Territory is the second smallest mainland state or territory by population. At the {{CensusAU|2016}}, the median weekly income for people in the territory aged over 15 was $998, significantly higher than the national median of $662.<ref name="census" /> The average level of degree qualification in the ACT is also higher than the national average. Within the ACT, 37.1% of the population hold a bachelor's degree level or above education compared to the national figure of 20%.<ref name="census" /> The Australian Capital Territory had the equal fourth highest [[Human Development Index]] score (0.976) [[List of subnational entities with the highest and lowest Human Development Index|out of over 1,700 subnational regions]] in 2022, coming close to a perfect score of 1.

==History==
{{main|History of the Australian Capital Territory}}

=== Indigenous inhabitants ===
[[Aboriginal Australians|Indigenous Australians]] have long inhabited the area.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |title=Canberra in two centuries: A pictorial history |last=Fitzgerald |first=Alan |publisher=Clareville Press |year=1987 |isbn=0-909278-02-4 |pages=4–5,12,92–93,115,128}}</ref> Evidence indicates habitation dating back at least 25,000 years,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Osborne |first1=Tegan |title=New dating shows 25,000 years of history at Birrigai rock shelter in ACT |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/specials/curious-canberra/2016-04-04/new-research-shows-human-occupation-in-act-extends-25,000-years/7288132 |access-date=20 August 2019 |agency=ABC News |date=5 May 2016}}</ref> and it is possible that the area was inhabited for considerably longer, with [[Lake Mungo remains|evidence of an Aboriginal presence at Lake Mungo]] dating back around 40,000–62,000 years.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bowler JM, Johnston H, Olley JM, Prescott JR, Roberts RG, Shawcross W, Spooner NA |title=New ages for human occupation and climatic change at Lake Mungo, Australia. |journal=Nature |volume=421 |issue=6925 |year=2003 |pages=837–40 |pmid=12594511 |doi=10.1038/nature01383 |bibcode=2003Natur.421..837B |s2cid=4365526}}</ref>  The principal group occupying the region were the [[Ngunnawal|Ngunnawal people]], with the [[Ngarigo]] and [[Walgalu]] living immediately to the south, the [[Wandandian|Wandadian]] to the east, the [[Gandangara]] to the north and the [[Wiradjuri]] to the north-west.<ref name="Gillespie84">{{cite book |last=Gillespie |first=Lyall |title=Aborigines of the Canberra Region |publisher=Wizard (Lyall Gillespie) |location=Canberra |year=1984 |pages=1–25 |isbn=0-9590255-0-2}}</ref>

=== European colonisation ===
Following European settlement, the growth of the new colony of New South Wales led to an increasing demand for [[arable land]].<ref name="Gillespie84" /> Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] supported expeditions to open up new lands to the south of [[Sydney]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite book |title=Canberra 1820–1913 |last=Gillespie |first=Lyall |publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service |year=1991 |isbn=0-644-08060-4 |pages=3–9,110–111,149,278,303}}</ref> The 1820s saw further exploration in the Canberra area associated with the construction of a road from Sydney to the [[Goulburn]] plains. While working on the project, [[Charles Throsby]] learned of a nearby lake and river from the local Indigenous peoples and he accordingly sent Wild to lead a small party to investigate the site. The search was unsuccessful, but they did discover the [[Yass River]], and it is surmised that they would have set foot on part of the future territory.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book |title=Old Canberra and the search for a capital |last=Fitzhardinge |first=L. F. |publisher=Canberra & District Historical Society |year=1975 |isbn=0-909655-02-2 |pages=1–3, 31–32}}</ref>

A second expedition was mounted shortly thereafter, and they became the first Europeans to camp at the [[Molonglo River|Molonglo]] (Ngambri) and [[Queanbeyan River|Queanbeyan]] (Jullergung) Rivers.<ref name=":2" /> However, they failed to find the [[Murrumbidgee River]].<ref name=":4" /> The issue of the Murrumbidgee was solved in 1821 when Throsby mounted a third expedition and successfully reached the watercourse, on the way providing the first detailed account of the land where the Australian Capital Territory now resides.<ref name=":4" /> The last expedition in the region before settlement was undertaken by [[Allan Cunningham (botanist)|Allan Cunningham]] in 1824.<ref name=":2" /> He reported that the region was suitable for grazing and the settlement of the Limestone Plains followed immediately thereafter.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Watson |first=F. |date=1931 |title=Special Article: Canberra Past and Present |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/4e782ee652d0db0aca2569de001fb2dd?OpenDocument |journal=Year Book Australia |access-date=8 April 2019}}</ref>

=== Early settlement ===
[[Image:ACT historic buildings map-MJC2.png|thumb|alt=Map locations concentrated in the northeast and east, west and south largely deserted except for the southern tip|Significant homesteads, structures and settlements in the ACT prior to 1909.]]
The first land grant in the region was made to Joshua John Moore in 1823, and European settlement in the area began in 1824 with the construction of a homestead by his stockmen on what is now the [[Acton Peninsula]].<ref name=":3" /> Moore formally purchased the site in 1826 and named the property ''Canberry'' or ''Canberra''.<ref name=":2" />

A significant influx of population and economic activity occurred around the 1850s [[Australian gold rushes|gold rushes]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/New-South-Wales/Kiandra/2005/02/17/1108500196974.html |title=Kiandra |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=5 February 2005 |access-date=19 February 2010}}</ref> The gold rushes prompted the establishment of communication between Sydney and the region by way of the [[Cobb and Co|Cobb & Co]] coaches, which transported mail and passengers.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book |title=Canberra: history of Australia's national capital |last=Wigmore |first=Lionel |publisher=Dalton Publishing Company |year=1971 |isbn=0-909906-06-8 |pages=20,113}}</ref> The first post offices opened in [[Ginninderra]] in 1859 and at Lanyon in 1860.<ref name=":3" />

During colonial times, the European communities of Ginninderra, [[Molonglo Plains|Molonglo]] and Tuggeranong settled and farmed the surrounding land. The region was also called the [[Queanbeyan]]-[[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]] district, after the two largest towns in the area. The villages of Ginninderra and Tharwa developed to service the local agrarian communities.

During the first 20 years of settlement, there was only limited contact between the settlers and Aboriginal people. Over the succeeding years, the Ngunnawal and other local indigenous people effectively ceased to exist as cohesive and independent communities adhering to their traditional ways of life.<ref name=":3" /> Those who had not succumbed to disease and other predations either dispersed to the local settlements or were relocated to more distant [[Aboriginal reserve]]s set up by the New South Wales government in the latter part of the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

=== Creation of the territory ===
[[Image:Surveyors camp Canberra.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Single wooden cabin and many white tents in open dusty field with single tree in foreground|The Federal Capital survey camp was established c. 1909. An extensive survey of the ACT was completed by Charles Scrivener and his team in 1915.]]

In 1898, a referendum on a proposed Constitution was held in four of the colonies – [[New South Wales]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Although the referendum achieved a majority in all four colonies, the New South Wales referendum failed to gain the minimum number of votes needed for the bill to pass. Following this result, a meeting of the four Premiers in 1898 heard from [[George Reid]], the [[Premier of New South Wales]], who argued that locating the future capital in New South Wales would be sufficient to ensure the passage of the Bill. The 1899 referendum on this revised bill was successful and passed with sufficient numbers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www-etsav.upc.es/personals/iphs2004/pdf/017_p.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www-etsav.upc.es/personals/iphs2004/pdf/017_p.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |title=Contested places for Australia's capital city |last=Birtles |first=Terry G. |date=2004 |website=11th Annual Planning History Conference |access-date=8 April 2019}}</ref> Section 125 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] thus provided that, following Federation in 1901, land would be ceded freely to the new [[Australian Government|federal government]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

This, however, left open the question of where to locate the capital.

The Australian Capital Territory was transferred to the Commonwealth by [[New South Wales]] on 1 January 1911, two years before the naming of Canberra as the national capital on 20 March 1913.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Fitzgerald, Alan John. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/27587510 |title=Canberra in two centuries : a pictorial history |date=1987 |publisher=Clareville Press in association with the Limestone Plains Partnership |isbn=0-909278-02-4 |location=Torrens, A.C.T. |oclc=27587510}}</ref>

The Commonwealth gained control of all land within the borders of the new territory but ownership only of NSW Crown land, with significant parcels of extant freehold remaining in the hands of their pre-existing owners. Much of this was acquired during [[World War One]], though a few titles were not transferred until the late 20th Century.

Land within the territory is granted under a [[leasehold]] system, with [[99-year lease|99-year residential leases]] sold to buyers as new suburbs are planned, surveyed, and developed. The current policy is for these leases to be extended for another 99-year period on expiry, subject to payment of an administrative fee.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.planning.act.gov.au/leasing-and-titles/crown-leases/leasehold |title=Leasehold |website=Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate – Planning |access-date=26 July 2023 |archive-date=26 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230726001305/https://www.planning.act.gov.au/leasing-and-titles/crown-leases/leasehold |url-status=dead }}</ref> In an arrangement inspired by [[Georgism]], the ideas of 19th-century American economist [[Henry George]], leaseholders had to pay 5% of the unimproved value of the underlying land in rent until the [[Gorton government]] abolished it in 1970.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/specials/curious-canberra/2016-07-04/can-people-own-land-in-the-act/7550166|title=Can people own land in the ACT?|publisher=ABC News|date=4 July 2016|accessdate=9 October 2021|first=Gordon|last=Taylor}}</ref>

In 1911, an international competition to design the future capital was held; it was won by the Chicago architect [[Walter Burley Griffin]] in 1912.<ref name=":3" /> The official naming of Canberra occurred on 12 March 1913 and construction began immediately.<ref name=":3" />

After Griffin's departure following difficulty in implementing his project,<ref name="act">{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalcapital.gov.au/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=136&Itemid=171 |title=History of the NCA |date=11 June 2009 |website=National Capital Authority |access-date=26 February 2010}}</ref> the [[Federal Capital Advisory Committee]] was established in 1920 to advise the government of the construction efforts.<ref name=":2" /> The committee had limited success meeting its goals. However, the chairman, [[John Sulman]], was instrumental in applying the ideas of the [[garden city movement]] to Griffin's plan. The committee was replaced in 1925 by the [[Federal Capital Commission]].<ref name=":2" />

In 1930, the ACT Advisory Council was established to advise the minister for territories on the community's concerns. In 1934, the [[Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory]] was established.<ref>{{Cite web |publisher=ACT Courts |title=ACT Supreme Court: About the Courts |date=16 December 2019 |url=https://courts.act.gov.au/supreme/about-the-courts |access-date=2020-06-18 |website=courts.act.gov.au |language=en}}</ref>

From 1938 to 1957, the [[National Capital Planning and Development Committee]] continued to plan the further expansion of Canberra. However, it did not have executive power, and decisions were made on the development of Canberra without consulting the committee.<ref name=":5" /> During this time, Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] regarded the state of the national capital as an embarrassment.<ref name=":6">{{Cite book |title=Canberra 1954–1980 |last=Sparke |first=Eric |publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service |year=1988 |isbn=0-644-08060-4 |pages=30,170–180}}</ref>

This Committee recommended the creation of a single planning body with executive power. Consequently, the [[National Capital Planning and Development Committee]] was replaced by the [[National Capital Development Commission]] in 1957.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Canberra's Engineering Heritage |last=Andrews |first=W.C. |publisher=Institution of Engineers Australia |year=1990 |isbn=0-85825-496-4 |pages=90}}</ref> The [[National Capital Development Commission]] ended four decades of disputes over the shape and design of [[Lake Burley Griffin]] and construction was completed in 1964 after four years of work. The completion of the centrepiece of Griffin's design finally laid the platform for the development of Griffin's [[Parliamentary Triangle, Canberra|Parliamentary Triangle]].<ref name=":6" />

=== Self-government ===
In 1978, an advisory referendum was held to determine the views of ACT citizens about whether there should be self-government. Just under 64 percent of voters rejected devolved government options, in favour of the status quo.<ref>{{cite web |last1=ACT Legislative Assembly |title=Establishing self-government in the ACT |url=https://www.parliament.act.gov.au/Explore-your-Assembly/resources/fact-sheets/self-government |access-date=30 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200418023423/https://www.parliament.act.gov.au/Explore-your-Assembly/resources/fact-sheets/self-government |archive-date=18 April 2020 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Nevertheless, in 1988, the new minister for the Australian Capital Territory [[Gary Punch]] received a report recommending the abolition of the [[National Capital Development Commission]] and the formation of a locally elected government. Punch recommended that the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke government]] accept the report's recommendations and subsequently [[Clyde Holding]] introduced legislation to grant self-government to the territory in October 1988.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Canberra: yesterday, today & tomorrow: a personal memoir |last=Overall |first=John |publisher=Federal Capital Press of Australia |year=1995 |isbn=0-9593910-6-1 |pages=128–129}}</ref>

The enactment on 6 December 1988 of the ''[[Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988]]'' established the framework for self-government.<ref name="ACT1988">{{cite web |url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?sdID=117 |title=Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cth) |publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]] |access-date=21 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050716075342/http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?sdID=117 |archive-date=16 July 2005}}</ref> The [[1989 Australian Capital Territory general election|first election]] for the 17-member [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly]] was held on 4 March 1989.<ref>{{cite web |title=Past ACT Legislative Assembly Elections |publisher=ACT Electoral Commission |url=http://www.elections.act.gov.au/elections_and_voting/past_act_legislative_assembly_elections |access-date=29 January 2010}}</ref>

At the first election, 4 of the 17 seats were won by anti-self-government single-issue parties due to a protest vote by disgruntled Canberrans and a total of 8 were won by minor parties and independents.<ref name=anniv/>

In 1992, Labor won eight seats and the minor parties and independents won only three. Stability increased, and in 1995, [[Kate Carnell]] became the first elected Liberal chief minister. In 1998, Carnell became the first chief minister to be re-elected.
==Geography==
[[File:ACT-Jervis Bay-Sydney-MJC.png|left|thumb|125px|Location of the ACT and Jervis Bay]]
The Australian Capital Territory is the smallest mainland territory (aside from the [[Jervis Bay Territory]]) and covers a total land area of {{cvt|2280|km2|mi2}}, slightly smaller than Luxembourg.

It is bounded by the [[Bombala railway line]] in the east, the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] of [[Naas (valley)|Naas Creek]] in the south, the watershed of the [[Cotter River]] in the west and the watershed of the [[Molonglo River]] in the north-east.

The Australian Capital Territory includes the city of [[Canberra]] and some towns such as [[Williamsdale, Australian Capital Territory|Williamsdale]], [[Oaks Estate]], [[Uriarra Village]], [[Tharwa]] and [[Hall, Australian Capital Territory|Hall]]. The Australian Capital Territory also contains agricultural land ([[domestic sheep|sheep]], [[dairy cattle]], [[vineyard]]s and small amounts of crops) and a large area of national park ([[Namadgi National Park]]), much of it mountainous and forested.

[[File:Swans on molonglo river.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Molonglo River]], located in the north-east of the region]]

Tidbinbilla is a locality to the south-west of Canberra that features the [[Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve]] and the [[Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex]], operated by the United States' [[NASA]] as part of its [[Deep Space Network]]. The [[Southern Tablelands Temperate Grassland]] straddles the state.

The territory includes a large range of mountains, rivers and creeks, largely contained within the [[Namadgi National Park]]. These include the Naas and Murrumbidgee Rivers.

In September 2022, it was announced that the border between NSW and the ACT would change for the first time since it was created in 1911.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2022-09-16 |title='It's happening': NSW-ACT border to change for first time since its creation as territory expands |language=en-AU |work=ABC News |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-09-16/border-to-change-to-allow-territory-expansion/101446700 |access-date=2022-09-16}}</ref> ACT chief minister [[Andrew Barr]] said NSW premier [[Dominic Perrottet]] had agreed to a proposed border change of {{cvt|330|ha|sqmi}} in the [[Ginninderra]] watershed.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-09-16 |title=NSW and ACT in talks over biggest border shake-up in living memory |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/sep/16/nsw-and-act-in-talks-over-biggest-border-shake-up-in-living-memory |access-date=2022-09-16 |website=the Guardian |language=en}}</ref>

January is the hottest month with an average high of 27.7&nbsp;°C.<ref name=":0" /> July is the coldest month when the average high drops to {{cvt|11.2|C|F}}.<ref name=":0" /> The highest maximum temperature recorded in the territory was 44.0&nbsp;°C on 4 January 2020. The lowest minimum temperature was −10.0&nbsp;°C on 11 July 1971.<ref name=":0" />

Rainfall varies significantly across the territory.<ref name=":0" /> Much higher rainfall occurs in the mountains to the west of Canberra compared to the east.<ref name=":0" /> The mountains act as a barrier during winter with the city receiving less rainfall.<ref name=":0" /> Average annual rainfall in the territory is 629mm and there is an average of 108 rain days annually.<ref name=":0" /> The wettest month is October, with an average rainfall of 65.3mm, and the driest month is June, with an average of 39.6mm.<ref name=":0" />

Frost is common in the winter months. [[Snow in Australia|Snow]] is rare in Canberra's city centre, but the surrounding areas get annual snowfall through winter and often the snow-capped mountains can be seen from the city. The last significant snowfall in the city centre was in 1968.<ref name=":0" />

Smoke haze became synonymous with the 2019/2020 Australian summer.

===Geology===
{{main|Geology of the Australian Capital Territory}}
Notable geological formations in the Australian Capital Territory include the ''Canberra Formation'', the ''Pittman Formation'', ''Black Mountain Sandstone'' and ''State Circle Shale''.

In the 1840s [[fossil]]s of [[brachiopod]]s and [[trilobite]]s from the [[Silurian]] period were discovered at Woolshed Creek near [[Duntroon, Australian Capital Territory|Duntroon]]. At the time, these were the oldest fossils discovered in Australia, though this record has now been far surpassed.<ref>{{citation |title=Entry to the ACT Heritage Register – 20010. Woolshed Creek Fossil Site |url=http://www.environment.act.gov.au/Files/heritageregister20010.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051022162853/http://www.environment.act.gov.au/Files/heritageregister20010.pdf |publisher=ACT Heritage Council |archive-date=22 October 2005}}</ref> Other specific geological places of interest include the State Circle cutting and the Deakin [[anticline]].<ref>{{cite AHD|105733|State Circle Cutting}}</ref><ref>{{citation |title=National Trust of Australia – Deakin Anticline |url=http://www.act.nationaltrust.org.au/places/deak-anti.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040706073745/http://www.act.nationaltrust.org.au/places/deak-anti.html |archive-date=6 July 2004}}</ref>

The oldest rocks in the ACT date from the [[Ordovician]] around 480 million years ago. During this period the region along with most of Eastern Australia was part of the ocean floor; formations from this period include the ''Black Mountain Sandstone'' formation and the ''Pittman Formation'' consisting largely of [[quartz]]-rich [[sandstone]], [[siltstone]] and [[shale]]. These formations became exposed when the ocean floor was raised by a major [[orogeny|volcanic activity]] in the [[Devonian]] forming much of the east coast of Australia.

=== Flora and fauna ===
{{main|Fauna of the Australian Capital Territory|Flora of the Australian Capital Territory}}
The environments range from [[Alpine climate|alpine]] area on the higher mountains, to [[sclerophyll]] forest and to [[woodland]]. Much of the ACT has been cleared for grazing and is also burnt off by [[Bushfires in Australia|bushfire]]s several times per century. The kinds of plants can be grouped into [[vascular plants]], that include [[gymnosperm]]s, flowering plants, and [[fern]]s, as well as [[bryophyte]]s, [[lichen]]s, fungi and freshwater [[algae]]. Four flowering plants are endemic to the ACT. Several lichens are unique to the territory. Most plants in the ACT are characteristic of the [[Australian flora|Flora of Australia]] and include well known plants such as [[Grevillea]], [[Eucalyptus]] trees and [[kangaroo grass]].

The native forest in the Australian Capital Territory was almost wholly [[Eucalyptus|eucalypt]] species and provided a resource for fuel and domestic purposes. By the early 1960s, logging had depleted the eucalypt, and concern about water quality led to the forests being closed. Interest in forestry began in 1915 with trials of a number of species including ''[[Pinus radiata]]'' on the slopes of Mount Stromlo. Since then, plantations have been expanded, with the benefit of reducing erosion in the Cotter catchment, and the forests are also popular recreation areas.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.cmd.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/113939/McLeodInquiry.pdf |title=Inquiry into the Operational Response to the January 2003 Bushfires in the ACT |last=McLeod |first=Ron |year=2003 |isbn=0-642-60216-6 |location=Canberra, ACT |publisher=ACT Government |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514031921/http://www.cmd.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/113939/McLeodInquiry.pdf |archive-date=14 May 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The fauna of the territory includes representatives from most major [[Fauna of Australia|Australian animal groups]]. This includes kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, platypus, echidna, emu, kookaburras and dragon lizards.

=== Territory government ===
{{See also|Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly|Electoral systems of the Australian states and territories|Government of the Australian Capital Territory}}

Unlike the States of Australia which have their own constitutions, territories like the ACT are governed under a Commonwealth statute<ref name=":10">[[Constitution of Australia]] s 122.</ref>{{mdash}}for the ACT, the ''[[Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00802 |title=Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cth) |website=[[Federal Register of Legislation]] |date=July 2016 |access-date=14 June 2019}}</ref> The ''Self-Government Act'' constitutes a democratic government for the Territory consisting of a popularly elected [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] which elects a [[Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory|Chief Minister]] from among its membership who, in turn, appoints an Executive consisting of a number of Ministers.

The executive power of the Territory rests with the [[Government of the Australian Capital Territory|ACT Government]], led by the Executive. The Executive is chaired by the Chief Minister (currently the [[Australian Labor Party (Australian Capital Territory Branch)|Labor Party]]'s [[Andrew Barr]]) and consists of Ministers appointed by them. The Executive are supported by the ACT Public Service, which is arranged into directorates, and a number of public authorities.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Home |url=https://www.directory.act.gov.au/ |access-date=2023-01-26 |website=Functions and Services Directory |publisher=ACT Government}}</ref> The Chief Minister is the equivalent of a [[Premiers and chief ministers of the Australian states and territories|State Premier]] and sits on the National Cabinet.<ref>{{citation |title=National Cabinet Members |url=https://federation.gov.au/national-cabinet/members |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia}}</ref> Unlike the States and the Northern Territory, there is no [[Governors of the Australian states|vice-regal representative]] who chairs the Executive. The Chief Minister performs many of the roles that a state governor normally holds in the context of a state; however, the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly gazettes the laws and summons meetings of the Assembly.

The [[Australian Labor Party (Australian Capital Territory Branch)|ACT Labor party]] has held Government since 2001.

The legislative power of the Territory is vested in the unicameral [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]]. The Assembly consists of 25 [[Template:ACTCurrentMLAs|members]] who are elected from [[Electorates of the Australian Capital Territory|five electorates]] using the [[Hare–Clark electoral system|Hare-Clark]] single transferable voting system.<ref>{{citation |title=Factsheet – Hare-Clark electoral system |date=5 July 2012 |url=http://www.elections.act.gov.au/publications/act_electoral_commission_fact_sheets/elections_act_factsheet_hare-clark_electoral_system |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606055358/http://www.elections.act.gov.au/publications/act_electoral_commission_fact_sheets/elections_act_factsheet_hare-clark_electoral_system |publisher=ACT Electoral Commission |archive-date=6 June 2013}}</ref> The Assembly is presided over by the Speaker (currently the Labor Party's [[Joy Burch]]).

=== Judiciary and policing ===
{{See also|Crime in the Australian Capital Territory}}
[[File:New Law Courts of the Australian Capital Territory.jpg|thumb|The Law Courts in Civic houses the Supreme Court and the Magistrates' Court]]
The judicial power of the Territory is exercised by the territory courts. These courts are the [[Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory]], the [[Magistrates Court of the Australian Capital Territory]] and the [[ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal]]. It is unique in that the territory does not have an intermediary court like other mainland states and territories; there is only the superior court and a court of summary jurisdiction. From 2001, appeals from the Supreme Court are heard by a panel of Supreme Court judges sitting as the Court of Appeal.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=2019-12-13 |title=Court of Appeal |url=https://courts.act.gov.au/supreme/about-the-courts/court-of-appeal |access-date=2023-01-26 |website=ACT Supreme Court |language=en}}</ref> The current Chief Justice is [[Lucy McCallum]] and the current Chief Magistrate is [[Lorraine Walker]].

The [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] has concurrent jurisdiction over civil matters arising under Territory law, a fact which has become increasingly important to the practice of [[Defamation|defamation law]] across Australia.<ref>[https://www.legislation.act.gov.au/View/a/1993-60/current/html/1993-60.html ''Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1993'' (ACT)] s 4</ref><ref>''Crosby v Kelly'' 203 FCR 451; [http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/FCAFC/2012/96.html <nowiki>[2012] FCAFC 96</nowiki>] (Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia).</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Schrapel |first=Sanjay |date=2020-09-02 |title=A 'non-colourable assertion' – litigating "pure" defamation claims in the Federal Court |url=https://commbarmatters.com.au/2020/09/02/a-non-colourable-assertion-litigating-pure-defamation-claims-in-the-federal-court/ |access-date=2023-01-26 |website=CommBar Matters |publisher=Commercial Bar Association of Victoria |language=en-AU |archive-date=26 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230126145110/https://commbarmatters.com.au/2020/09/02/a-non-colourable-assertion-litigating-pure-defamation-claims-in-the-federal-court/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Federal representation ===
In Australia's [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]], the ACT is represented by five federal members: three members of the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] represent the [[Division of Bean]], the [[Division of Canberra]] and the [[Division of Fenner]], and it is one of only two territories to be represented in the Senate, with two [[Australian Senate|Senators]] (the other being the Northern Territory). The Member for Bean and the ACT Senators also represent the constituents of [[Norfolk Island]]. The Member for Fenner and the ACT Senators also represent the constituents of the [[Jervis Bay Territory]].

=== Jervis Bay Territory ===
{{main|Jervis Bay Territory}}
In 1915, the ''[[Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915]]'' created the [[Jervis Bay Territory]] as an annex to the Federal Capital Territory. While the Act's use of the language of "annexed" is sometimes interpreted as implying that the Jervis Bay Territory was to form part of the Federal Capital Territory, the accepted legal position is that it has been a legally distinct territory from its creation despite being subject to ACT law and, prior to ACT self-government in 1988, being administratively treated as part of the ACT.<ref name="Spagnolo2015">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wlKXCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA65 |title=The Continuity of Legal Systems in Theory and Practice |author=Benjamin Spagnolo |date=22 October 2015 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-1-84946-884-8 |page=65 |quote=While the Jervis Bay Territory was constituted as a separate Territory on acceptance by the Commonwealth, it was 'annexed' to the Federal Capital Territory, to the extent that the laws there in force from time to time were 'applied' in the still legally distinct Jervis Bay Territory.}}</ref>

In 1988, when the ACT gained self-government, Jervis Bay was formally pronounced as a separate territory administered by the Commonwealth known as the Jervis Bay Territory. However, the laws of the ACT continue to apply to the Jervis Bay Territory.<ref name=":1" /> Magistrates from the ACT regularly travel to the Jervis Bay Territory to conduct court.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.courts.act.gov.au/magistrates/courts/jervis_bay_court |title=Jervis Bay Court |date=9 October 2016 |website=www.courts.act.gov.au |language=en |access-date=2019-04-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321014818/https://courts.act.gov.au/magistrates/courts/jervis_bay_court |archive-date=21 March 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Another occasional misconception is that the ACT retains a small area of territory on the coast on the [[Beecroft Peninsula]], consisting of a strip of coastline around the northern headland of Jervis Bay. While the land is owned by the Commonwealth Government, that area itself is still considered to be under the jurisdiction of New South Wales government, not a separate territory nor a part of the ACT.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C00038 |title=Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915 |date=2 October 2001 |access-date=30 November 2015}}</ref>

[[File:BikepathCanberra.jpg|thumb|Bikepath to Weston Creek.]]
[[File:Inner-canberra 01MJC.png|right|thumb|Inner Canberra demonstrates some aspects of the Griffin plan, in particular the [[Parliamentary Triangle, Canberra|Parliamentary Triangle]].]]The Australian Capital Territory consists of the city of [[Canberra]] and some towns including [[Williamsdale, Australian Capital Territory|Williamsdale]], [[Oaks Estate, Australian Capital Territory|Oaks Estate]], [[Uriarra, Australian Capital Territory|Uriarra]], [[Tharwa, Australian Capital Territory|Tharwa]] and [[Hall, Australian Capital Territory|Hall]].

The urban areas of the Australian Capital Territory are organised into a hierarchy of districts, town centres, group centres, local suburbs as well as other industrial areas and villages. There are seven districts (with an eighth currently under construction), each of which is divided into smaller suburbs, and most of which have a town centre which is the focus of commercial and social activities. The districts were settled in the following chronological order:
*[[North Canberra]]: mostly settled in the 1920s and '30s, with expansion up to the 1960s, now 14 suburbs;
*[[South Canberra]]: settled from the 1920s to '60s, 13 suburbs;
*[[Woden Valley]]: first settled in 1963, 12 suburbs;
*[[Belconnen]]: first settled in 1967, 25 suburbs;
*[[Weston Creek]]: settled in 1969, 8 suburbs;
*[[Tuggeranong]]: settled in 1974, 19 suburbs;
*[[Gungahlin]]: settled in the early 1990s, 18 suburbs although only 15 are developed or under development;
*[[Molonglo Valley]]: first suburbs currently under construction.

The North and South Canberra districts are substantially based on Walter Burley Griffin's designs.{{sfn|Wigmore|1971|p=64}} In 1967, the then [[National Capital Development Commission]] adopted the "Y Plan" which laid out future urban development in the Australian Capital Territory a series of central shopping and commercial area known as the 'town centres' linked by freeways, the layout of which roughly resembled the shape of the letter Y,{{sfn|Sparke|1988|pp=154–155}} with Tuggeranong at the base of the Y and Belconnen and Gungahlin located at the ends of the arms of the Y.{{sfn|Sparke|1988|pp=154–155}}
