There are many ideas about the derivation of the name Kastamonu:

According to the first view, it should be considered that the name Kastamonu is Turkishized from the name [[Paphlagonia|Paphlagonía]] [Greek "land of Paphlagon (people)"]. The region covering the [[West Black Sea Region (statistical)|West Black Sea]] and Central Black Sea regions was called Paphlagonia before the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]]. Today, Kastamonu, [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinop]], [[Bartın]], [[Çankırı]] and [[Karabük]] are located in this region, while parts of [[Çorum]], [[Bolu]], [[Zonguldak]] and [[Samsun]] provinces remain within the region. The Paphlagonians, who dominated this region in 1000 BC, gave their name to this geography.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nijman |first=Jan |title=Geography: Realms, Regions, and Concepts |date=2020 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1119607410 |edition=20.}}</ref>

According to a second opinion, the city of Kastamonu took its name from the name Kastama, which was used for the same region in the [[Hittites|Hittite]] period. The name Kastama turned into Kastamonu over time.<ref>Ahmet Ünal, Hititler Devrinde Anadolu Cilt 2, syf. 54</ref>

According to another view, the city of Kastamonu took its name from the combination of the words Gas and Tumanna. Gas, or better known as Kashkas, are among the first settlers of Kastamonu. Tumanna is the name of a city/region located on Kastamonu at that time. The combination of these two words took the form of Kastamonu over time.<ref>Talat Mümtaz Yaman, Kastamonu Tarihi, syf. 175</ref>

According to a third opinion, the city of Kastamonu took its name from the combination of the words Kastra and Komnen. The word Kastra means "castle" in Latin. The Komnens are a [[List of Roman dynasties|Byzantine Dynasty]] and the settlers of this region during the Byzantine period. These two words took the form of Kastamonu over time.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Archived Copy |url=http://www.kastamonukultur.gov.tr/TR-63806/tarihce.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930193226/http://www.kastamonukultur.gov.tr/TR-63806/tarihce.html |archive-date=30 September 2018}}</ref>

[[Ibn Battuta]] visited the city, noting it as "one of the largest and finest cities, where commodities are abundant and prices low." He stayed here forty days.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Battutah|first1=Ibn|title=The Travels of Ibn Battutah|date=2002|publisher=Picador|location=London|isbn=9780330418799|pages=117}}</ref>

The famous [[Sufi]] saint of the city is [[Sheikh (Sufism)|Sheikh]] [[Shaban Veli]] (''Şaban-ı Veli'' in Turkish, d. 976 AH/1569 AD).<ref>{{Cite web|title=ŞÂBÂN-ı VELÎ - TDV İslâm Ansiklopedisi|url=https://islamansiklopedisi.org.tr/saban-i-veli|access-date=2020-09-11|website=islamansiklopedisi.org.tr|language=tr}}</ref><ref>[https://www.laluask.com/2020/03/14/saban-i-veli/ Laluask: Şaban-ı Veli]</ref>

The Dress Code Revolution under President [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal Pasha]] (later known as Atatürk) was started on August 23, 1925, at Kastamonu. He made his historical speech concerning the "Hat and Dress Revolution" during his visit to Kastamonu in 1925 in the [[Republican People's Party]] building.<ref>{{Cite book|last=İğdemir|first=Uluğ|others=Mango, Andrew (trans.)|title=Atatürk|publisher=Turkish National Commission for UNESCO|location=Ankara|year=1963|oclc=75604149|pages=165–170}}</ref> The building is now used as the Archeological Museum of Kastamonu. The possessions used by Atatürk in his Kastamonu visit are also exhibited in the museum.

==Cuisine==

Homemade hot sauce is made by simmering grated tomato, garlic, Turkish red pepper, hot peppers, sunflower oil, salt and pepper on the stove. Sweet ''[[Qatlama|katmer]]'' is made by preparing a simple [[Unleavened bread|unleavened]] dough of flour, salt and water that is smeared with a [[tahini]] and sunflower oil mixture as it is folded.<ref name=kastamonu>{{Cite AV media| work = Show TV| title = Lezzet Haritası - Kastamonu /29 Kasım| access-date = 2018-07-30| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMQH4vZ-Q5Q}}</ref>

A speciality of [[Taşköprü, Kastamonu]] is freshly slaughtered whole lamb slow-cooked over the glowing embers of wood in a sealed, airtight "well" — this regional specialty is called ''kuyu kebabı'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. A little water added to a tray ensures that steam keeps the meat moist throughout the cooking process.<ref name=kastamonu />
