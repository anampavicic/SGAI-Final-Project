=== Effect of climate change in Jalingo ===
Africa, particularly Nigeria, is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change due to its geographical characteristics, including its arid northern border and coastal southern region. The region's heavy reliance on rain-fed agriculture, coupled with prevalent poverty and limited response capabilities, magnify its susceptibility. This situation, combined with insufficient adaptation measures and financial constraints among individuals, results in significant threats to both the social and economic well-being of Africa's population. Adverse consequences stemming from climate change, such as heightened temperatures, diminished water resources, loss of biodiversity, and increased disease transmission, significantly impact livelihoods. The lack of awareness, especially among less educated communities, contributes to behaviors that exacerbate the issue. Mobilizing the sizable student population in Nigerian tertiary institutions for climate change awareness can serve as a pivotal solution, bolstering adaptive capacity and sustainable livelihood strategies for the region. .<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Orunonye |first=E.
