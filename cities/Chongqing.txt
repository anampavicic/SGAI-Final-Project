{{main|History of Chongqing}}

===Antiquity===
Chongqing's location is historically associated with the [[Ba (state)|State of Ba]]. Its capital was first called Jiangzhou ({{lang|zh-hant|江州}}).<ref name="chongqing_3gorges">{{cite book |title=Chongqing & The Three Gorges |author1=Kim Hunter Gordon |author2=Jesse Watson |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vSNOR3qt6DwC |pages=38–40 |publisher=Kim Hunter Gordon |isbn=978-7-5022-5215-1 |access-date=26 August 2022 |archive-date=19 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230419201440/https://books.google.com/books?id=vSNOR3qt6DwC |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Imperial era===
Jiangzhou subsequently remained under [[Qin Shi Huang]]'s rule during the [[Qin dynasty]], the successor of the Qin State, as well as the rule of [[Han dynasty]] emperors.
Jiangzhou was subsequently renamed during the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] to Chu Prefecture ({{lang|zh-hant|楚州}}), then again in 581&nbsp;AD ([[Sui dynasty]]) to [[Yú Prefecture|Yu Prefecture]] ({{lang|zh-hant|渝州}}), and later in 1102 during [[Northern Song]] to Gong Prefecture ({{lang|zh-hant|恭州}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.cq.gov.cn/AboutChongqing/1920.htm |title=Chongqing's History with the State of Ba |publisher=Chongqing Municipal Government |date=6 December 2007 |access-date=2 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630171340/http://en.cq.gov.cn/AboutChongqing/1920.htm |archive-date=30 June 2012 }}</ref> The name Yu however survives to this day as an abbreviation for Chongqing, as well as for the city's historic center, where the old town once stood; its name is Yuzhong ({{lang|zh-hant|渝中}}, Central Yu).<ref name="chongqing_3gorges"/> It received its current name in 1189, after Prince [[Emperor Guangzong of Song|Zhao Dun]] of the [[Southern Song dynasty]] described his crowning as king and then [[Emperor Guangzong of Song|Emperor Guangzong]] as a "double celebration" ({{zh |s=双重喜庆 |t=雙重喜慶 |p=shuāngchóng xǐqìng }}, or ''chóngqìng'' in short). To mark the occasion of his enthronement, Yu Prefecture was therefore converted to Chongqing [[Fu (administrative division)|Fu]].

During and after the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], from November 1937 to May 1946, it was Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s provisional capital. After the General and remaining army had lived there for a time following their retreat in 1938 from the previous capital of [[Wuhan]], it was formally declared the second capital city ({{zh|c=陪都|p=péidū|w=p'ei2-tu1|labels=no}}) on 6 September 1940.<ref name="Revisiting Chongqing: China's Secon">{{cite journal |last1=Danielson |first1=Eric N. |title=Revisiting Chongqing: China's Second World War Temporary National Capital |journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch |date=2005 |volume=45 |page=175 |jstor=23889883 }}</ref> After Britain, the United States, and other Allies entered the war in Asia in December 1941, one of the Allies' deputy commanders of operations in Southeast Asia (Southeast Asia Command SEAC), [[Joseph Stilwell]], was based in the city.

Chongqing was acclaimed to be the "City of Heroes" due to the indomitable spirits of its people as well as their contributions and sacrifices during the [[World War II|War of Resistance-World War II]]. Many factories and universities were relocated from eastern China and ultimately to Chongqing during years of setbacks in the war, transforming this city from inland port to a heavily industrialized city. 

===Chinese Civil War===
After World War II ended, Chongqing became one of the last refuges of the Nationalist Kuomintang government on the Chinese mainland during the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Following the [[Yangtze River Crossing campaign]], the KMT capital of [[Nanjing]] was occupied by the Communists in 23 April. The KMT decamped first to [[Guangzhou]], then Chongqing. Chongqing served as the KMT capital until late November 1949, when the Nationalist KMT government withdrew from the city by air.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.needham.k12.ma.us/nhs/cur/wwii/06/p1/mjm/WWII-Chang.html |title=WWII Era History of Chongqing |publisher=.needham.k12.ma.us |date=23 October 1944 |access-date=10 December 2013  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606163106/http://www2.needham.k12.ma.us/nhs/cur/wwii/06/p1/mjm/WWII-Chang.html |archive-date=6 June 2013  }}</ref>

Its first official ceremony took place on 18 June 1997.

On 8 February 2010, Chongqing became one of the four [[National Central Cities]], along with Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. According to Zhou Liqun, a consultant for National Development and Reform Commission of China, Chongqing's status as a National Central City would encourage the development of [[Western China]]. Chongqing, which is located in central-western China, would complement the other National Central Cities, all of which are located along China's eastern coastline.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90882/6892862.html |title=Chongqing becomes 5th National Central city |publisher=People's Daily |date=10 February 2010 |access-date=10 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518015855/http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90882/6892862.html |archive-date=18 May 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The same year on June 18, the [[Liangjiang New Area]] was established in Chongqing, which was the third state-level [[new areas|new area]] at the time of its establishment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gochina.scmp.com/chongqing/business/room-expansion |title=Establishment of the Liangjiang New Area |publisher=Gochina.scmp.com |date=25 November 2013 |access-date=10 December 2013 |archive-date=25 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225054358/http://www.scmp.com/news/china }}</ref>

Chongqing covers a large area crisscrossed by rivers and mountains. The [[Daba Mountains]] stand in the north, the [[Wu Gorge]] in the east, the [[Wuling Mountains]] in the southeast, and the [[Dalou Mountains]] in the south. The area slopes downward from north to south towards the Yangtze valley, and features a large [[massif]] of mountains and hills, with steep sloping areas at different heights.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mountains in Sichuan and Chongqing |url=http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/china/sichuan-and-chongqing/sights-nam_class:31425.html |author=Chongqing Topography |publisher=Fodors.com |access-date=10 December 2013  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213182509/http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/china/sichuan-and-chongqing/sights-nam_class%3A31425.html |archive-date=13 December 2013  }}</ref> [[Karst]] landscape is common in this area, and stone forests, numerous collections of peaks, [[limestone]] caves and valleys can be found in many places.

The central urban area of Chongqing, called Chongqing proper, is built on mountains and partially surrounded by the Yangtze and Jialing rivers. With its special [[topography]], Chongqing's topography includes mountains, rivers, forests, springs, waterfalls, gorges, and caves. The [[Tang dynasty]] poet [[Li Bai]] was inspired by the natural scenery and wrote this [[epigram]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.poemhunter.com/li-po/ |title=Poems of Li Bai |via=Poemhunter.com |access-date=10 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627195909/http://www.poemhunter.com/li-po/ |archive-date=27 June 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The Zhongliang ({{zhi|c=中梁山}}) and Tongluo ({{zhi|s=铜锣山}}) mountains roughly form the eastern and western boundaries of Chongqing's urban area. Several high mountains are situated outside central Chongqing, including the {{cvt|1709.4|m|abbr=on}}-high Wugong Ling Mountain in Jiangjin.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

[[File:Chongqing Great Hall of the People 2017.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Great Hall of the People (Chongqing)|Great Hall of the People]] serves as the venue for major political conferences in Chongqing.]]
Since 1997 Chongqing has been a [[direct-controlled municipality]] in the Chinese administrative structure, making it a provincial-level division with commensurate political importance. The municipality's leader is Secretary of the [[Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party|Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party]], which since 2007, has also held a seat on the [[Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party]], the country's second highest governing council. Under the USSR-inspired [[nomenklatura]] system of appointments, individuals are appointed to the position by the central leadership of the CCP and bestowed to an official based on seniority and adherence to party orthodoxy, usually given to an individual with prior regional experience elsewhere in China and nearly never a native of Chongqing. Notable individuals who have held the municipal Party Secretary position include [[He Guoqiang]], [[Wang Yang (politician)|Wang Yang]], [[Bo Xilai]], [[Zhang Dejiang]], and [[Sun Zhengcai]], the latter three were Politburo members during their term as party chief. The party chief heads the municipal [[party standing committee]], the ''de facto'' top governing council of the municipality. The standing committee is typically composed of 13 individuals which includes the party chiefs of important subdivisions and other leading figures in the local party and government organization, as well as one military representative.

The [[Chongqing Municipal People's Government|municipal People's Government]] serves as the day-to-day administrative authority, and is headed by the [[Mayor of Chongqing|mayor]], who is assisted by numerous vice mayors and mayoral assistants. Each vice mayor is given jurisdiction over specific municipal departments. The mayor is the second-highest-ranking official in the municipality. The mayor usually represents the city when foreign guests visit.<ref>{{cite web |last=Page |first=Jeremy |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304459804577282280904864936 |title=Chongqing Party Chief Position |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=15 March 2012 |access-date=10 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171124203540/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304459804577282280904864936 |archive-date=24 November 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

The municipality also has a [[Chongqing Municipal People's Congress|Municipal People's Congress]], theoretically elected by lower level People's Congresses. The People's Congress nominally appoints the mayor and approves the nominations of other government officials. The People's Congress, like those of other provincial jurisdictions, is generally seen as a symbolic body. It convenes in full once a year to approve party-sponsored resolutions and local regulations and duly confirm party-approved appointments. On occasion the People's Congress can be venues of discussion on municipal issues, although this is dependent on the actions of individual delegates. The municipal People's Congress is headed by a former municipal official, usually in their late fifties or sixties, with a lengthy prior political career in Chongqing. The municipal Political Consultative Conference (''zhengxie'') meets at around the same time as the People's Congress. Its role is to advise on political issues. The ''zhengxie'' is headed by a leader who is typically a former municipal or regional official with a lengthy career in the party and government bureaucracy.

==Transportation==
Since its elevation to national-level municipality in 1997, the city has dramatically expanded its infrastructure. With the construction of railways and expressways to the east and southeast, Chongqing is a major transportation hub in southwestern China.

{{as of|2014|October|}}, the municipality had [[Yangtze River bridges and tunnels|31 bridges across the Yangtze River]] including over a dozen in the city's urban core.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china-yangtzecruise.com/mountain-city/sccq31.htm|title=New Scenery of Chongqing Metropolis|publisher=Green Travel|url-status=usurped|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512202118/http://www.china-yangtzecruise.com/mountain-city/sccq31.htm |archive-date=12 May 2013 }}</ref> Aside from the city's first two Yangtze River bridges, which were built, respectively, in 1960 and 1977, all of the other bridges were completed since 1995.

{{Main|Chongqing Rail Transit}}

Public transport in Chongqing consists of [[rapid transit|metro]], intercity railway, a ubiquitous bus system and the world's largest monorail network.

According to the Chongqing Municipal Government's ambitious plan in May 2007, Chongqing is investing 150&nbsp;billion RMB over 13 years to finish a system that combines underground [[rapid transit|metro lines]] with heavy [[monorail]].

{{As of|2017}}, four metro lines, the {{convert|14|km|abbr=on}} long CRT [[Line 1, Chongqing Rail Transit|Line 1]], a conventional subway, and the {{convert|19|km|abbr=on}} long heavy monorail CRT [[Line 2, Chongqing Rail Transit|Line 2]] (through Phase II), [[Line 3, Chongqing Rail Transit|Line 3]], a heavy monorail connects the airport and the southern part of downtown.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.cqnews.net/html/node_15161.htm |title=Line 2 & 1 |publisher=English.cqnews.net |date=15 December 2009 |access-date=10 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812045421/http://english.cqnews.net/html/node_15161.htm |archive-date=12 August 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref> [[Line 6, Chongqing Rail Transit|Line 6]], runs between [[Beibei District|Beibei]], a district in the city's far north to downtown.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cn.siemens.com/cms/cn/English/TS/Mobility/Press/Pages/ChongqingL6.aspx |title=Planning of Chongqing Line 6 |publisher=Cn.siemens.com |date=30 December 2010 |access-date=10 December 2013  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213185616/http://cn.siemens.com/cms/cn/English/TS/Mobility/Press/Pages/ChongqingL6.aspx |archive-date=13 December 2013  }}</ref> [[Line 5, Chongqing Rail Transit|Line 5]] opened in late 2017.

====Aerial tramway====
[[File:A aerial tramway across Yangtse river in Chongqing CBD Photo by Chen Hualin .jpeg|thumb|An aerial tramway across the Yangtze River in Chongqing CBD. (Photo by Chen Hualin)]]
Chongqing is the only Chinese city that has kept public [[aerial tramway]]s. Historically there were three aerial tramways in Chongqing: the Yangtze River Tramway, the Jialing River Tramway and the South Mountain Tramway. Currently, only Yangtze River Tramway is still in operation, it is also considered a Class 4A Tourist Attraction. The {{convert|1,160|m|adj=on|sp=us}}-long tramway connects the southern and northern banks of Yangtze River; its daily passenger volume is about 10,000.

===Rail===
[[File:Front South Square of Chongqingbei Railway Station.jpg|thumb|[[Chongqing North railway station]]]]

Major stations in Chongqing:

*[[Chongqing railway station]] in Yuzhong, accessible via Metro Lines 1 & 3 ([[Lianglukou station|Lianglukou Metro station]]), is the city's oldest railway station and located near the [[Jiefangbei CBD]] in the city center. The station handles mostly long-distance trains. There are plans for a major renovation and overhaul of this station, thus many services have been transferred to Chongqing North railway station.
*[[Chongqing North railway station]] is a station handling many long-distance services and high-speed rail services to Chengdu, Beijing and other cities. It was completed in 2006 and is connected to Metro Line.
*[[Chongqing West railway station]] is in Shapingba, a station handling many long-distance services and high-speed rail services to many cities. It was completed in 2018.
*[[Shapingba railway station]] is in Shapingba, near Shapingba CBD, accessible via [[Shapingba station|Shapingba metro station]] on Lines 1, 9 and the Loop line. It handles many local and regional train services. It was completed in 2018.
*Another railway station, [[Chongqing East railway station|Chongqing East]], is currently under construction and is expected to be completed in 2025.

Chongqing is a major freight destination for rail with continued development with improved handling facilities. Due to subsidies and incentives, the relocation and construction of many factories in Chongqing has seen a huge increase in rail traffic.

Chongqing is a major rail hub regionally.
*[[Chengdu–Chongqing railway]] (to [[Chengdu]], [[Sichuan]] Province)
*[[Sichuan–Guizhou railway]] (to [[Guiyang]], [[Guizhou]] Province)
*[[Xiangyang–Chongqing railway]] (to [[Hubei]] Province)
*[[Chongqing–Huaihua railway]] (to [[Hunan]] Province)
*[[Suining–Chongqing railway]] (to [[Sichuan]] Province)
*[[Chongqing–Lichuan railway]] (to [[Hubei]] Province)
*[[Lanzhou–Chongqing railway]] (to [[Gansu]] Province)

===River port===
[[File:YangtzeMeteor.jpg|thumb|[[Hydrofoil]] on the Yangtze in the outer reaches of the municipality<!--which county?-->]]
Chongqing is one of the most important inland ports in China. There are numerous luxury cruise ships that terminate at Chongqing, cruising downstream along the [[Yangtze River]] to [[Yichang]], [[Wuhan]], [[Nanjing]] or even Shanghai.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} In the recent past, this provided virtually the only transportation option along the river. However, improved rail, expressways and air travel have seen this ferry traffic reduced or cancelled altogether. Most of the river ferry traffic consists of leisure cruises for tourists rather than local needs. Improved access by larger cargo vessels has been made due to the construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]]. This allows bulk transport of goods along the Yangtze River. Coal, raw minerals and containerized goods provide the majority of traffic plying this section of the river. Several port handling facilities exist throughout the city, including many impromptu river bank sites.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://service-industries-research.hktdc.com/business-news/article/Transport-Logistics/Chongqing-River-Port-S-Container-Volume-Increases-16-9pc-In-May/spgz/en/1/1X000000/1X07JEN7.htm |title=Chongqing Ports Details |publisher=Service-industries-research.hktdc.com |date=19 July 2011 |access-date=10 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513061157/http://service-industries-research.hktdc.com/business-news/article/Transport-Logistics/Chongqing-River-Port-S-Container-Volume-Increases-16-9pc-In-May/spgz/en/1/1X000000/1X07JEN7.htm |archive-date=13 May 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

===Highways===
Traditionally, the road network in Chongqing has been narrow, winding and limited to smaller vehicles because of the natural terrain, large rivers and the huge population demands on the area, especially in the [[Yuzhong District]]. In other places, such as [[Jiangbei District, Chongqing|Jiangbei]], large areas of homes and buildings have recently been cleared to improve the road network and create better urban planning; thus, several ring roads have also been constructed. This has seen many tunnels and large bridges needing to be built across the city. The construction of many expressways have connected Chongqing to its neighbors. The natural mountainous terrain that Chongqing is built on makes many road projects difficult to construct, including for example some of the world's highest road bridges.<ref>{{cite web |first=Simon |last=Black |url=http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-07-12/markets/30008153_1_chongqing-china-building |title=Chongqing: World's Largest Construction Project |publisher=Articles.businessinsider.com |date=12 July 2011 |access-date=10 December 2013  |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130118200934/http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-07-12/markets/30008153_1_chongqing-china-building |archive-date=18 January 2013  }}</ref>

Unlike many other Chinese cities, it is rare for motorbikes, electric scooters or bicycles to be seen on Chongqing's Roads. This is due to the extremely hilly and mountainous nature of Chongqing's roads and streets. However, despite this, Chongqing is a manufacturing center for these types of vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.echinacities.com/chongqing/city-guide/travel/chongqing-travel-guide.html|title=Rough Guide to Chongqing Travel|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012201726/http://www.echinacities.com/chongqing/city-guide/travel/chongqing-travel-guide.html |archive-date=12 October 2012 }}</ref>

===Bridges===
[[File:Chaotianmen Bridge.jpg|thumb|View of [[Chaotianmen Bridge]] across the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] in Chongqing]]

With so many bridges crossing the Yangtze and Jialing rivers in the urban area, Chongqing is sometimes known as the 'Bridge Capital of China'. The first important bridge in urban Chongqing was the Niujiaotuo Jialing River Bridge, built in 1958. The first bridge over the [[Yangtze|Yangtze river]] was the Shibanpo Yangtze River Bridge (or Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge) built in 1977.

{{As of|2014}}, within the area of the 9 districts, there were 20 bridges on the [[Yangtze|Yangtze river]] and 28 bridges on the Jialing river. The bridges in Chongqing exhibit a variety of shapes and structures, making Chongqing a showcase for bridge design.

As the provisional Capital of China for almost ten years (1937 to 1945), the city was also known as one of the three headquarters of the Allies during [[World War II]], as well as being a strategic center of many other wars throughout China's history.
