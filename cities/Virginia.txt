'''Virginia''', officially the '''Commonwealth of Virginia''',{{efn|Virginia is one of [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|four U.S. states]] to use the term "Commonwealth" in its official name, along with [[Massachusetts]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Pennsylvania]].}} is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeastern]] and [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|Mid-Atlantic]] regions of the [[United States]] between the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] and the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. The state's [[List of capitals in the United States|capital]] is [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] and its most populous city is [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]]. Its most populous subdivision is [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], part of [[Northern Virginia]], where slightly over a third of Virginia's population of 8.7{{nbsp}}million live.

Eastern Virginia is part of the [[Atlantic Plain]], and the [[Middle Peninsula]] forms the mouth of the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Central Virginia lies predominantly in the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]], the foothill region of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], which cross the western and southwestern parts of the state. The fertile [[Shenandoah Valley]] fosters the state's most productive agricultural counties, while the economy in Northern Virginia is driven by [[technology company|technology companies]] and [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] agencies, including the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. [[Hampton Roads]] is also the site of the [[Virginia Port Authority|region's main seaport]] and [[Naval Station Norfolk]], the world's largest naval base.

Virginia's history begins with [[Native American tribes in Virginia|several Indigenous groups]], including the [[Powhatan]]. In 1607, the [[London Company]] established the [[Colony of Virginia]] as the first permanent [[English overseas possessions|English colony]] in the [[New World]], leading to Virginia's nickname as '''the Old Dominion'''. Slaves from Africa and land from displaced native tribes fueled the growing plantation economy, but also fueled conflicts both inside and outside the colony. Virginians [[Virginia in the American Revolution|fought for the independence]] of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in the [[American Revolution]], and helped establish the new national government. During the [[Virginia in the American Civil War|American Civil War]], the state government in Richmond joined the [[Confederated States of America|Confederacy]], while many northwestern counties remained loyal to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], which led to the separation of [[West Virginia]] in 1863.

Although the state was under [[Solid South|one-party rule]] for nearly a century following the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction era]], both major political parties have been competitive in Virginia since the repeal of [[Jim Crow laws]] in the 1970s. Virginia's state legislature is the [[Virginia General Assembly]], which was established in July 1619, making it the oldest current law-making body in [[North America]]. Unlike other states, cities and counties in Virginia function as equals, but the state government manages most local roads inside each. It is also the only state where governors are prohibited from serving consecutive terms.

Nomadic hunters are [[Peopling of the Americas|estimated to have arrived]] in Virginia around 17,000 years ago. Evidence from [[Daugherty's Cave and Breeding Site|Daugherty's Cave]] in [[Russell County, Virginia|Russell County]] shows it was regularly used as a [[rock shelter]] by 9,800 years ago.{{sfn|Egloff|Woodward|2006|pp=2–14}} During the late [[Woodland period]] (500–1000 [[Common Era|CE]]), tribes coalesced, and farming, first of corn and squash, began, with beans and tobacco arriving from [[Southwestern United States|the southwest]] and Mexico by the end of the period. [[Palisade]]d towns began to be built around 1200, and the native population in the current boundaries of Virginia reached around 50,000 in the 1500s.{{sfn|Egloff|Woodward|2006|pp=5, 31–39}} Large groups in the area at that time included the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] in the [[Tidewater region of Virginia|Tidewater region]], which they referred to as [[Tsenacommacah]], the [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian-speaking]] [[Nottoway Tribe|Nottoway]] and [[Meherrin]] to the north and south, and the [[Tutelo]], who spoke [[Siouan languages|Siouan]], to the west.<ref name=heinemann/>

The group financed an expedition under [[Christopher Newport]] that crossed the Atlantic and established a settlement named [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in May 1607.{{sfn|Conlin|2009|pp=30–31}}

Though more settlers soon joined, many were ill-prepared for the dangers of the new settlement. As the colony's president, [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] secured food for the colonists from nearby tribes, but after he left in 1609, this trade stopped and a [[Anglo-Powhatan Wars|series of ambush-style killings]] between colonists and natives under [[Powhatan (Native American leader)|Chief Powhatan]] and [[Opechancanough|his brother]] began, resulting in [[Starving Time (Jamestown)|mass starvation in the colony]] that winter.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoffer|2006|p=132}}; {{harvnb|Grizzard|Smith|2007|pp=128–133}}</ref> By the end of the colony's first fourteen years, over eighty percent of the roughly eight thousand settlers transported there had died.{{sfn|Heinemann|Kolp|Parent|Shade|2007|pp=30}} [[Tobacco in the American Colonies|Demand for exported tobacco]], however, fueled the need for more workers.{{sfn|Wallenstein|2007|p=22}} Starting in 1618, the [[headright]] system tried to solve this by granting colonists farmland for their help attracting [[indentured servant]]s.{{sfn|Hashaw|2007|pp=76–77, 239–240}} Enslaved Africans [[First Africans in Virginia|were first sold in Virginia]] in 1619.

From the colony's start, residents agitated for greater local control, and in 1619, certain male colonists began electing representatives to an assembly, later called the [[House of Burgesses]], that negotiated issues with the [[Virginia Governor's Council|governing council]] appointed by the London Company.{{sfn|Gordon|2004|p=17}} Unhappy with this arrangement, the monarchy revoked the company's charter and began directly naming [[List of colonial governors of Virginia|governors]] and Council members in 1624.

He surrendered to [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] in 1652, but after the 1660 [[Stuart Restoration|Restoration]] made him governor again, he blocked assembly elections and exacerbated the [[Class stratification|class divide]] by disenfranchising and restricting the movement of indentured servants, who made up around eighty percent of the colony's workforce.{{sfn|Tarter|2020|pp=62}} On the colony's frontier, [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] [[Native American tribes in Virginia|tribes]] like the [[Tutelo]] and [[Doeg people|Doeg]] were being squeezed by [[Seneca people|Seneca]] raiders from the north, leading to more confrontations with colonists. In 1676, several hundred working-class followers of [[Nathaniel Bacon (Virginia colonist)|Nathaniel Bacon]], upset by Berkeley's refusal to retaliate against the tribes, marched to Jamestown and burned it.{{sfn|Heinemann|Kolp|Parent|Shade|2007|pp=51–59}}

[[Bacon's Rebellion]] forced the signing of [[Bacon's Laws]], which restored some of the colony's rights and sanctioned both attacks on native tribes and the enslavement of their men and women.{{sfn|Tarter|2020|pp=63–65}} The [[Treaty of 1677]] further [[Tributary state|reduced the independence]] of the tribes that signed it, and aided the colony's assimilation of their land in the years that followed.{{sfn|Heinemann|Kolp|Parent|Shade|2007|pp=57}}{{sfn|Shefveland|2016|pp=59–62}} Colonists in the 1700s were pushing westward into this area held by the Seneca and their larger [[Iroquois|Iroquois Nation]], and in 1748, a group of wealthy speculators, backed by the British monarchy, formed the [[Ohio Company]] to start English settlement and trade in the [[Ohio Country]] west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].{{sfn|Anderson|2000|p=23}} The [[Kingdom of France]], which claimed this area as part of their colony of [[New France]], viewed this as a threat, and in 1754 the [[French and Indian War]] engulfed England, France, the Iroquois, and other allied tribes on both sides. A militia from several British colonies, called the [[Virginia Regiment]], was led by 21-year-old Major [[George Washington]], himself one of the investors in the Ohio Company.{{sfn|Anderson|2000|pp=42–43}}

The [[three-fifths compromise]] ensured that Virginia, with its large number of slaves, initially had the largest bloc in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Together with the [[Virginia dynasty]] of presidents, this gave the Commonwealth national importance. In 1790, Virginia and Maryland ceded territory to form the new national capital, which moved from [[Philadelphia]] to the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] a decade later, in 1800. In 1846, the Virginian area of the new capital was [[District of Columbia retrocession|retroceded]].{{sfn|Wallenstein|2007|p=104}} Virginia is called the "Mother of States" because of its role in being carved into states such as [[Kentucky]], which became the fifteenth state in 1792, and for the numbers of [[American pioneer]]s born in Virginia.<ref name=Robertson/>

King [[Charles II of England]] is first referred to "our auntient Collonie of Virginia" one of "our own Dominions" in 1662 or 1663, perhaps choosing this language because Virginia was home to many of his supporters during the [[English Civil War]].{{sfn|Berkeley|Billings|Kimberly|2007|pp=184–185}}{{sfn|Library of Virginia|1994|pp=88}} These supporters were called [[Cavalier]]s, and the nickname "The Cavalier State" was popularized after the [[American Civil War]].{{sfn|Welch|2006|pp=1–3}} Virginia has also been called the "Mother of Presidents", as eight Virginians have served as [[Lists of United States Presidents by place of birth#By state of birth|President of the United States]], including four of the first five.{{sfn|Goodwin|2012|pp=11–13}}

The state's motto, ''[[Sic semper tyrannis|Sic Semper Tyrannis]]'', translates from [[Latin]] as "Thus Always to Tyrants", and is used on the state seal, which is then used on the flag.<ref name="sic"/> While the seal was designed in 1776, and the flag was first used in the 1830s, both were made official in 1930.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.pilotonline.com/news/article_36f89ba4-ca4a-529a-be8f-31e8c1736068.html |title=Cuccinelli opts for more modest Virginia state seal |first= Julian |last= Walker |newspaper= The Virginian-Pilot |date= May 1, 2010 |access-date= June 7, 2020}}</ref> The majority of the other symbols were made official in the late 20th century.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.richmond.com/discover-richmond/the-state-of-the-state-emblems-checking-in-on-a-dozen-of-virginias-official-symbols/collection_7eafce86-1f1c-5d24-b9d0-dd2d83799482.html |title= The state of the state emblems: Checking in on a dozen of Virginia's official symbols |newspaper= The Richmond Times-Dispatch |date=February 18, 2017 |access-date= June 7, 2020}}</ref> In 1940, "[[Carry Me Back to Old Virginny]]" was named the [[List of U.S. state songs|state song]], but it was retired in 1997 due to its nostalgic references to slavery. In March 2015, Virginia's government named "[[Our Great Virginia]]", which uses the tune of "[[Oh Shenandoah]]", as the traditional state song and "[[Sweet Virginia Breeze]]" as the popular state song.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://patch.com/virginia/fairfaxcity/listen-virginia-now-has-2-state-songs|title=Listen: Virginia Now Has 2 State Songs|last=Hambrick|work=Patch|date=March 27, 2015|access-date=July 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711062929/http://patch.com/virginia/fairfaxcity/listen-virginia-now-has-2-state-songs|archive-date=July 11, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>
