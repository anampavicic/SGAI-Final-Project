'''Capas''', officially the '''Municipality of Capas''' ({{lang-pam|Balen ning Capas}};  
{{lang-tgl|Bayan ng Capas}}), is a 1st class [[Philippine municipality|municipality]] in the [[Philippine province|province]] of [[Tarlac]], [[Philippines]], and one of the richest towns in the province. The town also consists of numerous subdivisions and exclusive villages.

Capas is being dubbed as the “Tourism Capital of Tarlac." Apart from being known as the [[Camp O'Donnell|final site]] of the infamous [[Bataan Death March]], it is also known for [[Mount Pinatubo]] treks, where thousands of mountaineers and visitors go. The town has some industrial factories like the PilMiCo.

==History==
{{See also|Camp O'Donnell}}

Originally a part of [[Zambales]] and [[Pampanga]], its first settlers were the [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]] and the [[Aeta]]. It was founded in the year 1710 by the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] Friars. During the American Colonial period, the Americans built the Camp O'Donell for military installation until when the Japanese used it as a [[Camp O'Donnell|concentration camp]] during the [[Bataan Death March]] as the last stop of the march.

Capas as all other towns in Tarlac province was a part of vast wilderness inhabited by the Abelling tribes known as Aetas. The history of Capas dates back in the late 16th century when immigrants from Pampanga, Zambales, Pangasinan and the Ilocos region flock into the settlements.<ref>[https://www.capastarlac.gov.ph/barangay-odonnell/ History of O'Donnell] in capastarlac.gov.ph</ref> It is considered the oldest town in Tarlac. Capas became a pueblo (town) in 1710 beginning as a sleepy settlement at a place between Cutcut River in Sitio Pagbatuan and Gudya (present site) founded by Kapitan Mariano Capiendo. Capas' patron saint is San Nicolas de Tolentino. September 9–10 is the Capas Town Fiesta. Tarlac province was founded on May 28, 1874.

In the course of time, the townspeople of Capas were ordered by the Spanish authorities to change their family name of their own choosing on condition such family names begin with letter “C”, the first letter of Capas. Descendants of the early inhabitants still hold to this day such family names as Capiendo, Capuno, Capitulo, Capule, Capunpun, Cayabyab, Castañeda and Catacutan.

In the 1850s, Capas was a part of the western Pampanga Commandancia Militar de Tarlac which includes the town of Bamban, Concepcion, Victoria, O’Donnell, Murcia, Moriones, Florida Blanca, Porac, Mabalacat, and Magalang.

[[File:Landing Fields - Philippines - Plaridel through Panipuan - NARA - 68161112.jpg|thumb|O'Donnell Field in 1938]]
O’Donnell (Patling) was then a bustling pueblo established by the Augustinians Recolletos Mission in the 1800s, named in honor of Carlos O’Donnell y Abreu, the Spanish Minister of State who visited the Patling pueblo. O’Donnell was reverted as a barrio of Capas by the Philippine Commission of 1902 including Moriones reverted to Tarlac town and Murcia back to Concepcion. Capas is known in history as the site of the infamous death march concentration camp during World War II.

Of the etymology of Capas, old folks believed it derived its name from a wild vine "Capas-capas" or it originated from a tree called Capas in the Aetas dialect, Bulak in Pampango or Capaz in Ilocano.

The town has built the Capas National Shrine. It was built and is maintained by the Philippine government as a memorial to the Filipino and American soldiers who died in Camp O'Donnell at the end of the Bataan Death March, which totals to almost 70,000 soldiers and back-up civilians.

This is a memorable site, for all Filipino and American veterans, that relates to Veterans Day in the Philippines. It was once a concentration camp subsequently serving as the burial grounds for thousands of Filipino and American soldiers who perished during World War II. The site was the ultimate destination point of the [[Bataan Death March]] involving Filipino and American soldiers who surrendered in Bataan on April 9, 1942.

Camp O'Donnell was a facility of the United States Air Force in Capas, Tarlac, [[Philippines]]. Before the facility was transferred to the Philippine Air Force, it was first a Philippine Constabulary post then a United States Army facility.

Another site, Santo Domingo Death March Marker, which is located in Capas were about 60,000 Filipino soldiers who were camped and eventually unloaded to start the second phase of the Death March.

[[New Clark City]] ground broke in 2016 and is envisioned as a Business Contingency Hub of the National Government where it serves as a backup office should Metro Manila experience emergencies such as earthquakes, floods, and other calamities. It is located in the BCDA reservation in Capas that used to be a test site of military aircraft when [[Clark Air Base]] was under control of the United States. NCC will also serve as the primary venue of the [[2019 Southeast Asian Games]].

The west side of the town is mountainous while the east side is a plain. The town is also known as "The Gateway to Pinatubo Volcano." The town also consists of Hot springs and several freshwater lakes like the Tambo Lake. Capas is {{convert|108|km}} north of Manila and is {{convert|16|km}} southwest of the provincial capital, [[Tarlac City]].

Many of the streams in the province contain small bits of petrified wood, fish, freshwater crabs, and other animals.
