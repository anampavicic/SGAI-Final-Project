'''Leeuwarden''' ({{IPA|nl|ˈleːu.ɑrdə(n)|lang|453 Leeuwarden.ogg}}; {{langx|fy|Ljouwert|longname=yes}} {{IPA|fy|ˈljɔu(ə)t||Fy-Ljouwert.ogg}}; {{langx|nl|label=[[Stadsfries dialects|Town Frisian]]|Liwwadden}}; {{langx|nl|label=Leeuwarder dialect|Leewarden}}) is a [[List of cities in the Netherlands by province|city]] and [[Municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] in [[Friesland]], [[Netherlands]], with a population of 127,073 (2023). It is the provincial capital and seat of the [[Provincial Council of Friesland]].

The region has been continuously inhabited since the 10th century. It came to be known as Leeuwarden in the early 9th century AD and was granted [[Town privileges|city privileges]] in 1435. It is the main economic hub of Friesland, situated in a green and water-rich environment. Leeuwarden is a former royal residence and has a historic city centre, many historically relevant buildings, and a large shopping centre with squares and restaurants. Leeuwarden was awarded the title [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2018. Also, Leeuwarden has been a UNESCO [[City of Literature]] since 2019.

The {{lang|nl|[[Elfstedentocht]]}} (Eleven Cities Tour), an ice skating tour passing the eleven cities of Friesland, starts and finishes in Leeuwarden.

The following towns and villages within the municipality have populations in excess of 1,000 people: Leeuwarden, [[Stiens]], [[Grou]], [[Goutum]], [[Wergea]], [[Jirnsum]], [[Reduzum]], and [[Wirdum, Friesland|Wirdum]]. The municipality is governed by the mayor [[Sybrand van Haersma Buma]] and a coalition of the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]], [[Christian Democratic Appeal]], and [[GroenLinks|GreenLeft]].

==Etymology==
The name "Leeuwarden" (or older variants of it) first came into use for [[:nl:Nijehove|Nijehove]], the most important of the three villages (the other two being [[:nl:Oldehove (Leeuwarden)|Oldehove]] and [[:nl:Hoek (Leeuwarden)|Hoek]]) which in the early 9th century merged into Leeuwarden (Villa Lintarwrde {{circa}}&nbsp;825).<ref name="groot_10">{{Harvnb|Groot|Karstkarel|Kuipers|1984|p=10}}</ref> There is much uncertainty about the origin of the city's name. Historian and archivist [[:nl:Wopke Eekhoff|Wopke Eekhoff]] summed up a total of over 200 different spelling variants, of which ''Leeuwarden'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]), ''Liwwadden'' ([[Stadsfries]]), and ''Ljouwert'' ([[West Frisian language|West Frisian]]) are still in use.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180423-the-dutch-city-with-a-constantly-changing-name|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191211102703/http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180423-the-dutch-city-with-a-constantly-changing-name|url-status=dead|archive-date=2019-12-11|title=BBC - Travel - The Dutch city with a constantly changing name|date=2019-12-11|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref><ref name="groot_12">{{Harvnb|Groot|Karstkarel|Kuipers|1984|p=12}}</ref>

The second part of the name is easily explained: ''Warden'', West Frisian/Dutch/Low German for an artificial dwelling-hill, is a designation of [[terp]]s, reflecting the historical situation.<ref name="groot_12"/>

The first part of the name, ''leeuw'', means [[lion]] in modern standard Dutch. This interpretation corresponds with the [[coat of arms]] adopted by the city, which features a [[Lion (heraldry)|heraldic lion]]. However, modern standard Dutch was not used in this region in the [[Middle Ages]], when the city was called ''Lintarwrde''. Some scholars argue that the name of the city is derived from ''leeu-'', a corruption of ''luw-'' (Dutch for 'sheltered from the wind', cf. the [[Sea|maritime]] term [[leeward]]) or from ''lee-'' (a Dutch word for waterway). 'Sheltered landing place or harbour' could be the original meaning. This suits the watery province of [[Friesland]] and the position of the original three villages at the end of an important estuary called [[Middelzee]].<ref name="groot_12"/>

The name is also similar to that of the French commune [[Lewarde]], located in the [[Nord (French department)|Nord Department]], an originally Flemish-speaking area annexed to France in the 17th century. [[Western Flemish]] was related to Frisian and also to Saxon up to the 11th century.

The oldest remains of houses date back to the 2nd century AD in the Roman era and were discovered during an excavation near the [[Oldehove (tower)|Oldehove]]. Inhabited continuously since the 10th century, the city's first reference as a population centre is in German sources from 1285, and records exist of [[Town privileges|city privileges]] granted in 1435. Situated along the [[Middelzee]], it was an active centre of maritime trade.<ref>[https://historischcentrumleeuwarden.nl/english Stadsgeschiedenis Leeuwarden] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230405012409/https://historischcentrumleeuwarden.nl/english |date=5 April 2023 }}, [[Historisch Centrum Leeuwarden]].</ref> The waterway silted-up in the 13th century.<ref>Langen, G. de ''Leeuwarden 750 - 2000 Hoofdstad van Friesland'' p. 19 (Franeker 1999)</ref>

The [[Grote of Jacobijnerkerk]] ({{langx|en|Great, or Jacobin Church}}) is the oldest building in the city. The 15th century was the period of the two opposing Frisian factional parties [[Vetkopers and Schieringers]]. The [[bastion]]s and a [[moat]] were built in the period 1481–1494. In 1747 [[William IV, Prince of Orange]] was the last [[stadtholder]] residing in the [[Stadhouderlijk Hof]]. In the first half of the 19th century the fortifications were demolished.

From 1580 to 1752, a provincial mint operated in the city, minting gold, silver and copper coins of Friesland.<ref>[http://www.duiten.nl/friesland.html De muntslag van Friesland] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231125161845/http://www.duiten.nl/friesland.html |date=25 November 2023 }} www.duiten.nl</ref>

In 1901 the city's population was 32,203.

Leeuwarden, like the rest of the Netherlands, was occupied by [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces in 1940–1945. This ended when elements of the [[Royal Canadian Dragoons]] seized the initiative and advanced into the heavily-defended city on 15 April 1945, ignoring direct orders to wait for supporting infantry. German forces had been driven out by the end of the next day. (The anniversary is marked by both the Dragoons and the city, by flying each other's flags every 15 April.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://army.ca/forums/index.php?topic=29655.0|title=Army.ca forums|date=15 April 2005|access-date=18 July 2017|archive-date=16 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416073619/https://army.ca/forums/index.php?topic=29655.0|url-status=live}}</ref>

''[[Kneppelfreed]]'' ({{langx|en|Baton Friday}}) was an incident on 16 November 1951 in front of the courthouse at Wilhelminaplein (Wilhelmina Square), when the police used [[baton (law enforcement)|batons]] against [[West Frisian language#Status|Frisian language]] activists during a protest against the exclusive use of Dutch in the courts.<ref>[http://www.11en30.nu/de-canon-vensters/kneppelfreed?language=ned Canon of Frisian History - Kneppelfreed] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240817115328/http://www.11en30.nu/de-canon-vensters/kneppelfreed?language=ned |date=17 August 2024 }} 11en30.nu Retrieved 28 March 2018.</ref> A committee of inquiry recommended that the Frisian language should receive legal status as a minority language.

==Heraldry==
The [[coat of arms]] of Leeuwarden is the official symbol of the municipality. It consists of a [[Azure (heraldry)|blue]] [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]], a [[Or (heraldry)|golden]] [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]], and a [[Crown (headgear)|crown]]. The fact that Leeuwarden carries a lion in its seal seems logical, considering that "Leeuw" is Dutch for "Lion". However, it is very plausible the oldest name of the city conceals an indication of water rather than an animal, and some sources suggest that the lion may have only been added after the name became official. It is also possible the coat of arms was a gift to the city from the powerful ''Minnema'' family.<ref name="44_gemeenten">{{Cite book |last1=Jansma|first1=Klaas |title=Friesland en zijn 44 gemeenten |publisher= Friesch Dagblad|year=1981 |isbn=90-6480-015-4 |page=45 |location=Leeuwarden}}</ref>
