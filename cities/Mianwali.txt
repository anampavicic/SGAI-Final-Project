'''Mianwali'''  ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]/{{langx|ur|{{Nastaliq|مِيانوالى}}}}) city in [[Mianwali Tehsil]], is the capital city of [[Mianwali District]] in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrb.gov.pk/lg_election/union.asp?district=19&dn=Mianwali|url-status=dead|title=Tehsils and Unions in the District of Mianwali (Mianwali city and Mianwali Tehsil)|website=National Reconstruction Bureau, Government of Pakistan website|archive-date =11 June 2008|access-date=4 June 2023            |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611223556/http://www.nrb.gov.pk/lg_election/union.asp?district=19&dn=Mianwali}}</ref> The [[Largest cities of Pakistan|81st largest city]] of Pakistan, it is known for its diverse population of [[Punjabis|Punjabi]], [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] and [[Saraiki people|Saraiki]] ethnicities.

== History ==
Mianwali District was an agricultural region with forests during the [[Indus Valley civilisation|Indus Valley Civilization]].  Then later [[Vedic Civilization]] took place. In 997 CE, [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi]] took over the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid dynasty]] empire established by his father, [[Sabuktigin|Sultan Sebuktegin]]. In 1005 he conquered the [[Hindu Shahi|Shahi]]s in [[Kabul]], followed by the conquests of [[Punjab region]]. The [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later [[Mughal Empire]] ruled the region. The population of the Punjab region became majority [[Muslim]], following the conquests by various Muslim dynasties from Central Asia.<ref>{{Cite web |title=SDPOs and Police Stations - Mianwali  |url=https://www.punjabpolice.gov.pk/mianwali_directory |access-date=4 June 2023 |website=Punjab Police, Government of the Punjab website}}</ref>

Before the British rule, the area formed an integral portion of the [[Graeco-Bactrian]] [[Indo-Greeks|Empire of Kabul and the Punjab]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Imperial Gazetteer2 of India, Volume 17, page 318 -- Imperial Gazetteer of India -- Digital South Asia Library |url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V17_324.gif |access-date=2023-06-04}}</ref> Immediately preceding the annexation of the Punjab by the British after the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]], this area was part of the [[Sikh Empire]]. During [[British Raj|British rule]], the Indian empire was subdivided into provinces, divisions and districts; afterward, the independence of Pakistan [[Divisions of Pakistan|divisions]] remained the third tier of government until 2000. The British had made the town of Mianwali as [[tehsil]] headquarters of [[Bannu District]] then part of [[Dera Ismail Khan Division]] of [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab province]]. The population of Mianwali, according to the 1901 [[census of India]], was 3,591.

== Geography ==
[[File:Thal Canal.JPG|alt=Image of the iconic Thal Canal from main Mianwali City bridge.|thumb|Image of the [[Thal Canal]] from main Mianwali City bridge.]]

The city of Mianwali is located in North-west region of the [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]]. The city is located near to the [[Chashma Barrage|Chashma lake]] to south west and [[Namal Lake]] to its north east. The Chasma lake is home to the Chasma Barrage, that houses a 184 MW power station.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2013-01-23 |title=Pakistan seeks control gear, transformer bay for 184-MW Chashma hydro project |url=https://www.hydroreview.com/world-regions/pakistan-seeks-control-gear-transformer-bay-for-184-mw-chashma-h/|access-date=2023-06-04 |website=Hydro Review website |language=en-US}}</ref> The Chasma lake also houses one of the two nuclear power facilities in Pakistan – the [[Chashma Nuclear Power Plant]]. The city has an airport built near the old [[World War II]] aerodrome and known as [[Mianwali Airbase|M.M.Alam Base Mianwali]]. It is one of the major operational and training air bases of the country. The No. 1 Fighter Conversion Unit of the [[Pakistan Air Force|PAF]] is stationed here. Notable locations in the vicinity of the city include:

=== Chasma Nuclear Power Plant ===
The '''[[Chashma Nuclear Power Plant]]''' (or '''CHASNUPP'''), is a large commercial [[nuclear power plant]] located in the vicinities of [[Chashma, Pakistan|Chashma colony]] in Mianwali District [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] in [[Pakistan]]. Officially known as '''Chashma Nuclear Power Complex''', the nuclear power plant is generating energy for industrial usage with four nuclear reactors with one being in planning phase in cooperation with the [[China]]. Supported by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) and [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] of the [[United States]].

It was established in 2000, the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant became operational, when it joined the nation's grid system with [[China National Nuclear Corporation]] overseeing the grid connections of the power plant. In 2004, the China National Nuclear Corporation was awarded contract for building a second unit based on the first reactor, followed by contracting for two more reactors in 2011.

=== M.M Alam Pakistan Airforce Base ===
'''[[PAF Base M.M. Alam]]''' ([[IATA airport code|IATA]]: '''MWD''', [[ICAO airport code|ICAO]]: '''OPMI''') is a [[Pakistan Air Force]] [[Military airbase|airbase]] located at Mianwali, in the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] province of [[Pakistan]]. The base is named after [[Muhammad Mahmood Alam]]. It primarily serves as the Fighter converter base for the Pakistan Air Force.

Originally a [[World War II]] airstrip, it was decided that Mianwali would be upgraded into a satellite airbase for [[PAF Base Mushaf]] (then PAF Base Sargodha) during the [[1965 Indo-Pak War]] to act as an alternate recovery airfield. The airbase was again upgraded to a permanent operational airbase in August 1974, although construction of facilities was not completed for another three years.

=== Namal Institute  ===
The '''[[Namal Institute]]''' is a [[private university]] about 20 min drive from the city of Mianwali. The institute is located on 30&nbsp;km, [[Talagang]] Mianwali Road near [[Namal Lake]]. Initially it was established as an affiliate college of the [[University of Bradford|University of Bradford, UK]]. Later in 2019, Namal College acquired a DAI (Degree Awarding Institute) status and thus became Namal Institute. There are further plans to turn the small campus into an education city, construction is already underway.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Namal Institute|url=https://www.namal.edu.pk/|access-date=2021-01-17|website=www.namal.edu.pk}}</ref>

== Demographics ==
Mianwali city has an urban population of 118,883,<ref name=city/> accounting for only about 20.82% of [[Mianwali District|Mianwali District's]] population. The rest of 79.18% of the rural population is spread around the district in small villages called Moza's. The average household size comes about to 7.1, that means on average 7 people live in one house. This is in line with Joint family culture prominent in North-West regions of [[Pakistan]]. Mianwali has a literacy ratio of about 42.8%, considerably less than other urban cities in [[Punjab]].

As for male to female ratio, Male inhabitants count for 63.8% of population and female inhabitants account for the remaining 22.2%. This number may somewhat be inaccurate, as [[Burqa|Parda]] culture doesn't allow audience with non-[[Mahram]]s. So census teams might have not been able to accurately access the number of females in each house.

== Language ==
The main languages spoken in the city include [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Pashto]] and [[Urdu]].
