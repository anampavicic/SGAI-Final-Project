'''Tabasco''' ({{IPA|es|taˈβasko|-|TabascoPronunciation.ogg}}), officially the '''Free and Sovereign State of Tabasco''' ({{langx|es|link=no|Estado Libre y Soberano de Tabasco}}), is one of the [[Political divisions of Mexico|32 Federal Entities]] of [[Mexico]]. It is divided into [[Municipalities of Tabasco|17 municipalities]] and its capital city is [[Villahermosa]].

It is located in southeast Mexico and is bordered by the states of [[Campeche]] to the northeast, [[Veracruz]] to the west, and [[Chiapas]] to the south and the [[Petén Department|Petén]] department of [[Guatemala]] to the southeast. It has a coastline to the north with the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Most of the state is covered in [[rainforest]] as, unlike most other areas of Mexico, it has plentiful rainfall year-round. The state is also home to [[La Venta]], the major site of the [[Olmecs|Olmec]] civilization, considered to be the origin of later [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures. It produces significant quantities of petroleum and natural gas.

==Geography==
The state is located in the southeast of Mexico, bordering the states of [[Campeche]], [[Chiapas]], and [[Veracruz]], with the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the north and the country of [[Guatemala]] to the south and east. The state covers {{convert|24,731|km2|mi2}}, which is 1.3 percent of Mexico's total.<ref name="resumeninegi">{{cite web |url=http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/tab/default.aspx?tema=me&e=27 |title=Estado de Tabasco – Resumen |publisher=INEGI |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=State of Tabasco – Summary |access-date=December 31, 2011 |archive-date=November 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127085447/http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/tab/default.aspx?tema=me&e=27 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="terrinegi">{{cite web |url=http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/Tab/Territorio/default.aspx?tema=ME&e=27 |title=Estado de Tabasco – Territorio |publisher=INEGI |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=State of Tabasco – Territory |access-date=December 31, 2011 |archive-date=October 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006051152/http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/tab/territorio/default.aspx?tema=me&e=27 |url-status=live }}</ref> The northwestern portion is on the coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico with the south and east as part of the mountain chain that extends into northern Chiapas.

[[File:Regions of tabasco-Es.png|thumb|left|Regions of Tabasco]]
In 1994, the state was officially divided into two regions and five sub-regions for socioeconomic development and geographic documentation. The two major regions are called the Grijalva and the Usumacinta. The Grijalva Region is named after [[Grijalva River|the river on which most of the municipalities here are dependent]]. It is the smaller of the two regions with a territory of {{convert|12,069.34|km2|mi2}} or 48.94 percent of the state's territory; however, it contains most of Tabasco's urban population as well as of its socioeconomic and political activity. It is divided into three sub-regions called [[Chontalpa]], Centro and Sierra; it includes the municipalities of Huimanguillo, Cárdenas, Comalcalco, Cunduacán, Paraíso, Jalpa de Méndez, Nacajuca, Centro, Jalapa, Teapa and Tacotalpa. The Usumacinta Region is named after [[Usumacinta River|the main river]] on which the Centla, Jonuta, Emiliano Zapata, Balancán and Tenosique municipalities depend. It is divided into the Pantanos and Ríos subregions, which are both more rural than the Grijalva Region.<ref name="regionalizacion">{{cite web |url=http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb/ELOCAL/EMM_tabasco |title=Regionalización |year=2010 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Tabasco |publisher=INAFED Gobierno del Estado de Tabasco |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Regions |access-date=December 31, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref>

The environment of the state consists of extensive low-lying floodplains, mountains and valleys.<ref name="masexpos">{{cite journal |last1=Roldan |first1=Nadia |date=November 10, 2008 |title=From MasExpos Magazine: Tabasco Itineraries |journal=Meeting News |volume=32 |issue=19 |pages=34 }}</ref> Most of the territory is covered with tropical rainforest and wetlands. There are also areas with [[savanna]], beaches and [[mangrove]] forests. Much of the rainforest has suffered degradation due to over-logging and conversion of territory into farmland. The east is formed of low humid plains formed by sediment deposited by a number of rivers. In the Chontalpa zone and in parts of the municipalities of Centla and Jonuta, there are [[swamp]]y depressions extremely vulnerable to flooding from both riverflow and from excessive rainfall.<ref name="mediofisico"/> In the south there are some elevations which are part of the central mesa of Chiapas. The most important of these is El Madrigal, La Campana, La Corona, Pomaná, Coconá, Mono Pelado and El Tortuguero. However, most hills in the state do not exceed {{convert|30|m|ft}} above sea level.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

[[File:Villahermosa Panorámica 1.jpg|thumb|280px|View of [[Villahermosa]], the capital of Tabasco]]

There are four principal ecosystems in the state: tropical [[rainforest]], tropical [[savannah]], beaches and wetlands. Tropical rainforest dominates most of the state due to the high levels of rainfall the area receives. However, what exists today is only a fraction of what used to be, as much of the forest area has been over-exploited by man, mostly through logging and slash-and-burn agriculture. Most of the intact rainforest is found in the municipalities of Tenosique, Balancán, Macuspana, Teapa, Tacotalpa, Cárdenas and Huimanguillo.

These rainforests contain species such as [[mahogany]], [[Cedar (plant)|cedar]], numerous types of [[palm tree|palm]], [[Jacaranda mimosifolia|jacarandas]], [[ceiba]], [[Salix]] and many more. There are various types of [[orchids]], [[bromeliads]], [[tillandsia]], [[ferns]], and [[Araceae|aroid plants]] native to the state, along with a variety of species of [[Cactaceae|cactus]], both terrestrial-arid and epiphytic-forest types. Examples include [[Epiphyllum anguliger]], [[Schlumbergera]], and [[Disocactus]]. This state also has one of the widest varieties of wildlife in the country, such as [[macaw]]s, [[yellow-headed parrots]], [[resplendent quetzal]], numerous endemic [[hummingbird]]s, [[green iguana]], and numerous species of snakes. Mammal species have declined because of deforestation, but still persist; one may encounter [[spider monkey]]s, [[squirrel monkey]]s, [[jaguar]], [[ocelot]], [[coatimundi]], [[jaguarundi]], [[oncilla]], [[coyote]], [[margay]], [[bobcat]], [[Mountain lion|puma]], [[raccoon]], [[northern tamandua]], [[prehensile-tailed porcupine]], [[agouti]], [[paca]], [[woolly opossum|woolly]] and [[Virginia opossum|common opossums]], [[brocket deer]], [[white-tailed deer]], [[collared peccary]] and [[Central American tapir|tapir]].

Tropical savannah is mostly found in the southern part of the state, mixed in with areas of rainforest. These areas are dominated by grasses and bushes along with some smaller trees such as jahuacte, [[Acrocomia|cocoyol]] and small palm trees. The savannah has wildlife such as rabbits, deer, foxes, and various species of birds.

Along the coast the soil is sandier and while the vegetation is still tropical, species are different from in the interior rainforest. They include coconut palms, palo mulato, [[royal palm]], and pimento de Tabasco. These areas have suffered the most from slash and burn agriculture.

Most of the wetlands of the state belong to the [[Pantanos de Centla Biosphere Reserve]]. The abundance of fresh water in wetlands and river areas supports a wide variety of aquatic life such as freshwater gar, [[mojarra]], crocodiles, various species of turtles and frogs, and many species of native and migratory waterfowl. In larger bodies of water [[manatee]]s can be found. In the brackish and salt water lagoons various ocean species are found, as well as shellfish and mollusks, and bird species such as seagulls and pelicans.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

Tabasco has a hot tropical climate, with the Gulf of Mexico having significant influence on weather patterns.<ref name="mediofisico"/> Over 95 percent of the state's territory has a hot, wet climate. The rest is hot and semi-humid, located in the far northeast of the state.<ref name="terrinegi"/> The average annual temperature is {{convert|27|C|F}} with high temperatures averaging {{convert|36|C|F}}, mostly in May, and lows of {{convert|18.5|C|F}} in January.<ref name="terrinegi"/> Unlike many parts of Mexico, Tabasco has abundant year round precipitation.<ref name="actecon"/> The state receives an average annual rainfall of {{convert|2,550|mm|ft}}. Rain occurs all year but is particularly heavy from June to October.<ref name="terrinegi"/> The flat areas of the state are subject to frequent flooding. One reason for this is the rivers that flow from the Sierra region and the Usuamacinta River. Another is that there are a number of dams such as the Angostura, Chicoasén, Malpas and Peñitas; these are built for hydroelectricity and flood control, but can overflow.<ref name="senado">{{cite report |date=March 5, 2008 |title=Informe de las Inundaciones de 2007 en el Estado de Tabasco Diagnóstico Preliminar |language=es |trans-title=Report of the Floods of 2007 in the State of Tabasco Preliminary Analysis |publisher=Senate of Mexico Comisión de Asuntos Hidráulicos |url=http://www.imta.mx/gaceta/anteriores/g12-04-2008/informe-tabasco.pdf |access-date=December 31, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515063655/http://www.imta.mx/gaceta/anteriores/g12-04-2008/informe-tabasco.pdf |archive-date=May 15, 2013 }}</ref>

==History==

===Pre-Columbian period===
[[File:Comalcalco.jpg|right|thumb|[[Comalcalco (archaeological site)|Comalcalco]]]]
The origin of the name Tabasco is not definitively known, with a number of theories debated among linguists. The name appears in the chronicles of [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]] during the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest era]], who mentions a river named after local ruler [[Tabscoob]]. One possible theory states that it is from [[Nahuatl]] with two possible derivations: one meaning "place that has a lord" and the other "place where the land is moist". The state seal is that which was granted in 1598 to the town of Villahermosa, then called San Juan Bautista by [[Philip II of Spain]]. This is one of the oldest coats of arms in the Americas.<ref name="nomenclatura">{{cite web |url=http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb/ELOCAL/EMM_tabasco |title=Nomenclatura |year=2010 |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Tabasco |publisher=INAFED Gobierno del Estado de Tabasco |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Nomenclature |access-date=December 31, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref>

The [[Olmec]] civilization dominated much of what is now Tabasco 3,000 years ago, reaching a height around 800 BC. It was the oldest [[Mesoamerica]]n culture, dominating what are now the states of [[State of Mexico|Mexico]], [[Guerrero]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Veracruz]] and Tabasco as well as parts of Central America, and is considered the founding culture for all of Mesoamerica.<ref name="masantiguo">{{cite news |title=Lo mas antiguo de Mexico: Tabasco, tierra con historia |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=March 16, 2001 |page=3 |language=es |trans-title=The most ancient of Mexico:Tabasco, land with history }}</ref> The main Olmec site in Tabasco is [[La Venta]].

In the early 16th century, the main ethnicities of Tabasco were the [[Chontal Maya|Mayas-Chontals]], the [[Zoque people]], and the [[Popoloca]]s, living in small villages with the Chontales dominating.<ref name="masantiguo"/><ref name="etapagob">{{cite web |url=http://www.tabasco.gob.mx/estado/hist_02conquista.php |title=Etapa de la Conquista |publisher=State of Tabasco |access-date=December 31, 2011 |language=es |trans-title=Conquest period |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082748/http://www.tabasco.gob.mx/estado/hist_02conquista.php |archive-date=April 26, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The first contact with the Spanish came in 1518 when an expedition headed by Captain [[Juan de Grijalva]] disembarked at the mouth of the river that now bears his name. [[Hernán Cortés]] came the following year and fought the natives here at the [[Potonchán#Battle of Centla|Battle of Centla]]. As conqueror, Cortés received twenty female slaves, one of whom was [[La Malinche]].<ref name="masantiguo"/><ref name="etapagob"/>

Despite the early conquest and the foundation of Santa María de la Victoria (today [[Frontera, Tabasco|Frontera]]), the territory was not fully subjugated because of the climate, terrain and lack of minerals.<ref name="masantiguo"/><ref name="etapagob"/> The [[Franciscans]] arrived in the 16th century to evangelize, but they did not stay. For this reason, the indigenous people of this area were not generally converted to Catholicism, unlike other parts of [[New Spain]].<ref name="etapagob"/> Tabasco was a landing and crossing point for the conquest of southern Mexico and Guatemala, referenced by Hernán Cortés in one of his letters to the [[Spanish Crown]]. It was noted by him and by [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]] for its abundance of [[Theobroma cacao|cacao]].<ref name="etapagob"/>

The introduction of European diseases decimated the local population, resulting in the Spanish bringing [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] [[slave]]s to work plantations. This led to some mixing among the three races which has affected the ethnic appearance of the people of the state.<ref name="etapagob"/> Significant agricultural production was not achieved until the 18th century, primarily in cacao and cattle. During this time the sea traffic to Villahermosa increased, which made it a relatively important port.<ref name="masantiguo"/> For the rest of the colonial period, most of Tabasco would have no major events and no major commerce in comparison to the rest of the country.<ref name="colonialgob">{{cite web |url=http://www.tabasco.gob.mx/estado/hist_03epocolonial.php |title=Epoca Colonial |publisher=State of Tabasco |access-date=December 31, 2011 |language=es |trans-title=Colonial period |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082753/http://www.tabasco.gob.mx/estado/hist_03epocolonial.php |archive-date=April 26, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Spanish did not begin to pacify the area until the second half of the 16th century, when Santa María de la Victoria was secured, slightly inland from the original Frontera location. However, in the meantime, English pirates had taken possession of the nearby [[Isla del Carmen]] and other points in the Gulf for piracy. Santa María de la Victoria was attacked and sacked, forcing the settlement to move inland in 1598 to San Juan Bautista (today [[Villahermosa, Tabasco|Villahermosa]]), renamed Villa Hermosa by the Spanish Crown, which gave it the oldest coat of arms on the American mainland, today the seal of the state of Tabasco.<ref name="enchis"/><ref name="colonialgob"/> At the beginning of the 18th century, Tabasco and [[Veracruz]] united to combat the pirate threat, and succeeded in expelling them from the Isla del Carmen. The city returned to its original and current location in 1795.<ref name="enchis"/> At that time, the entire state had a population of only 36,000 in two towns, two villages, and various ranches and farms. The province sent a delegate to Spain to complain about the marginalization of the area to the Crown.<ref name="colonialgob"/>

===Independence and 19th century===
The first insurgent during the [[Mexican War of Independence]] in the state was José María Jiménez, who declared the state's independence in 1815. However, Jiménez was soon jailed and local authorities proclaimed allegiance to the Crown.<ref name="1821gob">{{cite web |url=http://www.tabasco.gob.mx/estado/hist_05proclindep.php |title=1821 – Proclamación de Independencia |publisher=State of Tabasco |access-date=December 31, 2011 |language=es |trans-title=1821 – Proclamation of Independence |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082759/http://www.tabasco.gob.mx/estado/hist_05proclindep.php |archive-date=April 26, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> At the end of the war in 1821, Tabasco became one of the first fourteen states under the 1824 Constitution.

Political instability in the state and an outbreak of [[cholera]] forced Tabasco to rejoin the federation. In 1836, a group of Conservatives took control of the federal government, but Tabasco Liberals decided to rebel against this government until they were defeated.<ref name="liberalgob">{{cite web |url=http://www.tabasco.gob.mx/estado/hist_07centralistas.php |title=Centralistas y Federalistas |publisher=State of Tabasco |access-date=December 31, 2011 |language=es |trans-title=Centralists and Federalitsts |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082846/http://www.tabasco.gob.mx/estado/hist_07centralistas.php |archive-date=April 26, 2012 }}</ref>
[[File:Intervención estadounidense en Tabasco.jpg|thumb|Image of the U.S. invasion of Villahermosa]]

During the [[Mexican–American War]], troops under [[Matthew C. Perry]] arrived in Tabasco in 1846. Other ships arrived soon after and took possession of the port of Frontera.<ref name="invasiongob">{{cite web |url=http://www.tabasco.gob.mx/estado/hist_08invasion.php |title=La Invasión Norteamericana |publisher=State of Tabasco |access-date=December 31, 2011 |language=es |trans-title=The North American Invasion |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082854/http://www.tabasco.gob.mx/estado/hist_08invasion.php |archive-date=April 26, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On their first attempt to take Villahermosa upriver, they failed. The second attempt bombarded the city before successfully taking it. However, the Tabascans formed guerrilla groups and this along with the inhospitable climate forced the U.S. military to withdraw soon after.<ref name="enchis"/>

After the Americans left, Tabasco governor [[Justo Santa Anna]] rebelled against Mexico City over its lack of support during the war. The Americans returned in 1847 to attack the capital. It was defended by local troops, but they did not have the necessary supplies. The Americans occupied the capital for another thirty-five days, causing great destruction.<ref name="invasiongob"/>

During the [[Second French intervention in Mexico|French intervention in Mexico]], the French took Villahermosa in 1862, installing a governor. Tabasco's forces retreated into the mountains. Meanwhile, various Tabascans formed a newspaper called ''El Dissidente'', which criticized the French-installed government.<ref name="enchis"/><ref name="intervenciongob">{{cite web |url=http://www.tabasco.gob.mx/estado/hist_09intervencion.php |title=La Intervención en Tabasco |publisher=State of Tabasco |access-date=December 31, 2011 |language=es |trans-title=The Intervention in Tabasco |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082901/http://www.tabasco.gob.mx/estado/hist_09intervencion.php |archive-date=April 26, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> There were several insurrections against this government such as the one headed by [[Andrés Sánchez Magallanes]] in 1863. He raised a small army from various parts of the state and attacked the imperial army barracks in [[Comalcalco]], then moved on to Villahermosa in November 1863. Here they encountered imperialist troops at what is now called the {{Interlanguage link|Battle of Jahuactal|es|Batalla de El Jahuactal}}, where the insurgents won, expelling the French from the state.<ref name="enchis"/><ref name="jahuactalgob">{{cite web |url=http://www.tabasco.gob.mx/estado/hist_10jahuactal.php |title=La Batalla de El Jahuactal |publisher=State of Tabasco |access-date=December 31, 2011 |language=es |trans-title=The Battle of El Jahuactal |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301101245/http://www.tabasco.gob.mx/estado/hist_10jahuactal.php |archive-date=March 1, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The [[Porfirio Díaz]] period from the 1880s to 1910 was free from political violence and allowed the state to build infrastructure, but only slowly owing to its isolation. The capital, heavily damaged by decades of war, was reconstructed, with many old buildings torn down to make way for new ones. In 1879, the Instituto Juárez was inaugurated. In 1881, telegraph service connected Villahermosa with [[Mexico City]]. The capital received electricity in 1890, with the new state government palace opened in 1894 and the first bank in 1901.<ref name="enchis"/> Tabasco experienced significant economic development during the Díaz period in the late 19th century, with cacao and other products shipped worldwide.<ref name="masantiguo"/> However, this development led to widespread [[deforestation]], which began in the latter decades of the 19th century when timber companies cut down large areas of [[rainforest]].<ref name="enchis"/>

While Díaz remained in power, Tabasco governor {{Interlanguage link|Abraham Bandala|es|Abraham Bandala Patiño}} also remained from 1894 to 1910, re-elected to office sixteen times.<ref name="enchis"/> Timber and agriculture made the elite in the state rich, with most of the rest of the population workers indebted to their employers. The technological progress was accompanied by poor and even slave-like conditions for many workers. This fueled resentment in the state and the rest of the country. This resentment led to the [[Mexican Revolution]].<ref name="enchis"/><ref name="porfiristagob">{{cite web |url=http://www.tabasco.gob.mx/estado/hist_12porfirio.php |title=Época Porfirista |publisher=State of Tabasco |access-date=December 31, 2011 |language=es |trans-title=Porfirian Era |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082913/http://www.tabasco.gob.mx/estado/hist_12porfirio.php |archive-date=April 26, 2012 }}</ref> In 1879, the first institute of higher education, the Instituto Juárez, was opened. During this time period, a woman by the name of Salomé Marín Virgilio founded schools in Balancán to teach workers to read and write along with liberal political ideas. Her work would later inspire [[José María Pino Suárez]].<ref name="enchis"/>

===Mexican Revolution to the present===
[[File:Revolucionarios tabasqueños.jpg|thumb|Group of revolutionaries from Tabasco]]
Anti-Díaz sentiment began in the decade of 1900 with efforts to keep Bandala from being re-elected. The first vocal opponent to the Díaz regime in Tabasco was local journalist [[Domingo Borrego]]. In [[Huimanguillo]], [[Chontalpa]], the first "Club Anti reelection Melchor Ocampo" was formed to oppose the government but it was disbanded quickly. By 1909, there were a number of large protests in the state which led to the formation of the Gutierrista Party, headed by [[Ignacio Gutiérrez Gómez]] along with his two brothers. These and others in the state joined forces politically with [[Francisco I. Madero]] and a new Club Anti-reelecionista was formed in Huimanguillo. These efforts succeeded in defeating Bandala and replacing him with [[Policarpo Valenzuela]], calming the situation in the state for a short while. After Madero was assassinated, the politics of the state fractured, with various factions vying for the governor's position leading to insurrection and frequent government changes who were allied with the various armies vying for power nationally.<ref name="revolgob">{{cite web |url=http://www.tabasco.gob.mx/estado/hist_13tabrevol.php |title=Tabasco Revolucionario |publisher=State of Tabasco |access-date=December 31, 2011 |language=es |trans-title=Revolucionary Tabasco |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082917/http://www.tabasco.gob.mx/estado/hist_13tabrevol.php |archive-date=April 26, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Another important episode in the history of the state was the governorship of [[Tomás Garrido Canabal]] after the end of the Revolution. He was elected in 1922, allied with Mexican presidents [[Álvaro Obregón]] and later [[Plutarco Elías Calles]]. He implemented an ambitious socialist program, organizing unions and consolidating power though his Radical Socialist Party (Partido Socialista Radical). He reestablished the state's teachers’ college and established a system of rural schools. Livestock-raising increased and general economic levels rose. He prohibited the production and sale of alcoholic beverages in the state. An atheist, he persecuted the Catholic Church, destroying various churches including the [[Villahermosa Cathedral|Tabasco Cathedral]]. Events relating to this were portrayed in the novel ''[[The Power and the Glory]]'' by [[Graham Greene]].<ref>Barbara A. Tenenbaum and Georgette M. Dorn (eds.), ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'' (New York: Scribner's, 1996).</ref><ref>Stan Ridgeway, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/msem.2001.17.1.143 "Monoculture, Monopoly, and the Mexican Revolution"] ''Mexican Studies / Estudios Mexicanos'' 17.1 (Winter, 2001): 143.</ref> He organized "cultural assemblies with the aim of persuading people away from religion, sometimes burning images of saints. He even forbade the use of crosses on graves and changed the names of towns and ranches to rid them of religious references.

In the 1950s, [[Carlos A. Madrazo]] became governor; he promoted large public works, agricultural and industrial projects, and initiated exploration for petroleum.<ref name="masantiguo"/> The highway along the Gulf Coast linking eastern Tabasco with [[Veracruz]] and the [[Yucatan Peninsula]] was completed in 1956. During the same decade, a museum dedicated to the La Venta archeological site was founded by [[Carlos Pellicer]].<ref name="enchis"/>

In the 1960s and 1970s, the educational system was modernized, instituting free breakfasts for students. Infrastructure projects improved or created docks, roads, monuments and sporting facilities mostly in the capital and municipal seats. Agriculture was the focus of programs called [[Chontalpa#Economy|Plan Chontalpa]] and Plan Balacán-Tenosique and free health care clinics were built in rural areas.<ref name="enchis"/>

Oil and natural gas were discovered at this time and in 1974, the development of these resources began.<ref name="enchis"/> The petroleum boom produced great wealth, but there have been disputes over the money earned from the facilities owned by [[PEMEX]], the nation's oil company. The industry has put pressure on the state's infrastructure, housing and supplies of basic necessities. New roads, bridges and a modern airport have been constructed with oil money, along with a Centro de Investigaciones de la Cultura Olmeca y Maya, the Teatro del Estado, a planetarium and a convention center in the capital.<ref name="enchis"/> The PEMEX facilities have caused environmental damage, and damage to local farmers’ crops. There have been issues related to the breaking of environmental laws, but corruption and the lack of legal jurisdiction outside of the federal government, which owns PEMEX, has hampered efforts to sue for enforcement. In 1996, hundreds of blockades of installations were carried out by locals with the active support of the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]] (PRD). The most notable was the blocking of the bridge to the Sen oil field. It was broken up by police but the following month 30,000 marched on Villahermosa to protest.<ref name="grassroots">{{cite journal |last1=Town |first1=Sara |date=Jan–Feb 2001 |title=Oil at the grassroots: Report from Tabasco |journal=NACLA Report on the Americas |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=34–35 }}</ref> The friction between the populace and the government over oil and other issues led to some political restructuring in the state. This was accompanied with general dissatisfaction with the ruling party, the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]], nationwide. Reforms to decentralize power away from Villahermosa were undertaken but in the 1990s, political instability remained with farmers, ranchers and others continuing to complain about how PEMEX was affecting their economic activities.<ref name="enchis"/>
[[File:2007 Tabasco flood.jpg|thumb|Scene from the 2007 floods]]

Flooding has historically been an issue in the state, which has year-round heavy rainfall and various rivers flowing through it. Villahermosa was founded on a hill between the Sierra and [[Grijalva River]]s. The growth of the city from the 1970s on has brought development down from the hill onto the floodplains. Recent major flooding includes events in 1975, 1990 and 1999. The last prompted the creation of the Programa Integral de Control de Inundaciones (Integral Program for Flood Control) to build dams, dikes and other flood control measures. These were in process of construction when the 2007 floods hit. From October 28 to 30, unusually heavy rainfall caused the Grijalva River to rise, overflowing the [[Peñitas Dam]], as well as other area rivers. This eventually covered about eighty percent of the state's territory as deep as {{convert|4|meters|ft}} in places, affecting over a million people.<ref name="senado"/> The flood damage was made worse by the presence of human settlements on flood plains and the lack of hydraulic infrastructure on the Sierra and [[Usumacinta]] rivers. There was also a lack of warning systems and evacuation plans for those downriver.<ref name="senado"/>

In the 1990s, various technical colleges were established in the state along with the Universidad Popular de la Chontalpa and another in [[Tenosique]]. Hospitals in various municipalities and various historic centers were reconstructed, especially that of Villahermosa.<ref name="enchis"/>

==Economy==

Most of the state's poor are concentrated in the [[Jonuta Municipality|Jonuta]], [[Tacotalpa]], [[Centla Municipality|Centla]] and Humanguillo municipalities as these lack any major industry.<ref name ="agobia"/>

The heavy rainfall in the state does not lend itself well to annual crops and frequent flooding is a problem as well. Despite this, there is significant production of corn, [[sorghum]] and beans. Most of the commercially important crops are perennials, such as cacao, coconut, oranges, bananas and sugar cane. There is also important pasture, both natural and seeded.<ref name="terrinegi"/><ref name="actecon"/> The state has extensive areas of natural grasslands. Due to the climate, the [[Zebu]] breed of cattle does best and is mostly raised for meat. Cattle accounts for about three quarters of the meat produced in the state. Other livestock includes pigs, sheep, goats and domestic fowl. Most livestock is raised in the Villahermosa, [[Cárdenas, Tabasco|Cárdenas]] and [[Emiliano Zapata Municipality, Tabasco|Emiliano Zapata]] municipalities.
[[File:Paraíso Puerto de Dos Bocas.jpg|left|thumb|View of the port of Dos Bocas]]

Tabasco has salt water and fresh water fishing along its shoreline and in the many rivers and small lakes but they are not extensively exploited, providing less than two percent of Mexico's total fish production. Commercial species include oysters, [[mojarra]], shrimp, sea bass, shark, lobster and gar. Most fishing fleets are located in Frontera, with others in [[Sanchez Magallanes]], [[Chilitepec]], and [[Paraíso, Tabasco#Dos Bocas port|Dos Bocas]].<ref name="actecon"/> The state has natural resources such as mahogany, cedar and other tropical hardwoods.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

Mining, mostly of petroleum and natural gas, provides most of the state's GDP.<ref name="resumeninegi"/> Only 14.6 percent of the working population is in mining. About 19 percent work in construction, transportation and manufacturing.<ref name="econinegi"/> Most manufacturing is food processing, bottling and tobacco products.<ref name="econinegi"/> About ninety percent of industrial establishments are family-owned, mostly dedicated to food processing in and around Villahermosa. The most important industry is petroleum refining, done by PEMEX in the [[Macuspana]] municipality. There are 860 wells in various municipalities extracting crude oil and natural gas.<ref name="actecon"/> It produces 556,371 barrels of crude oil and {{convert|1,363,000|ft3|m3}} of natural gas per day.

==Culture==
Traditional masculine dress consists of a white shirt and pants, with black boots or shoes, black belt, a hat in a style called "chontal" and a red handkerchief around the neck. This dress is based on an older type of clothing called ''traje choco'', made of cotton cloth called manta, used to work in the fields.<ref name="trajegob">{{cite web |url=http://www.tabasco.gob.mx/estado/cultura_trajereg.php |title=Trajes Regionales |publisher=State of Tabasco |access-date=December 31, 2011 |language=es |trans-title=Regional Garb |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105020620/http://www.tabasco.gob.mx/estado/cultura_trajereg.php |archive-date=January 5, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The traditional female dress consists of a wide skirt trimmed with a ruffle. Under the skirt is a slip designed to fluff the skirt and make the waist look smaller. The blouse is white with an embroidered band in bright colors, often with flower and/or animal designs. It has short sleeves ending in a square form in the lower part. The woman often carried a small handkerchief and a shawl called a ''rebozo'' in bright colors, often complementing the skirt. The shoes are black.<ref name="trajegob"/>

The state has a number of unique traditional dances due to its relative isolation from the rest of the country. These include "El Gigante" of [[Nacajuca]], performed on August 14. "Baila Viejo" is performed in Tucta and Guaytalpa in the municipality of Nacajuca as well as the Atasta de Serra in [[Villahermosa, Tabasco|Villahermosa]]. "El Pochó" is of pre Hispanic origin and is performed during Carnival in [[Tenosique]]. "Los Blanquitos" is also performed in Tenosique and symbolizes the struggle of black slaves during the colonial period. "El Caballito Blanco" depicts the struggles of the indigenous against the Spanish at the [[Battle of Centla]]. [[Zapateo]] is said to be derived from the fandango, brought to the area by a conquistador called Ortíz de Séquito.

[[File:Zapateo tabasqueño 1.jpg|thumb|Zapateo, the traditional dance of Tabasco]]

Traditional music has its origins in the Olmec period with other indigenous influences such as those of the [[Mayan peoples|Maya]], [[Mexica]]s and [[Nahua peoples|Nahuas]]. It is based on flute and percussion, including drums made of tortoise shells and flutes/whistles made of ceramic. Purely indigenous music has almost entirely disappeared, replaced by that of European influence. [[Fandango]] influence was the first to arrive, which was modified then called fandanguillo leading to songs called zapateos in the colonial period, played by small orchestras. These were mostly composed of wind instruments but the marimba and drums called temborileros were added. This music was accompanied by a dance of the same name. Later, short improvised rhymes called "bombas" were added varying by region often consisting of a man and woman answering each other.<ref name="atraccul"/>

The cuisine is based on the foods of the ancient Mayas and Chontals, using plants and animals native to the region such as [[achiote]], chili peppers, [[chipilín]] (amashito) and [[banana leaves]], with corn and beans serving as the base.<ref name="gastrogob">{{cite web |url=http://www.tabasco.gob.mx/estado/cultura_gastro.php |title=Gastronomía Tabasqueña |publisher=State of Tabasco |access-date=December 31, 2011 |language=es |trans-title=Tabasco Gastronomy |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906015040/http://www.tabasco.gob.mx/estado/cultura_gastro.php |archive-date=September 6, 2011 }}</ref> (amashito) Traditionally, people in Tabasco eat seven times a day, these meals are called "puntal" (after getting out of bed), breakfast, "refigerio," "apertivo," "comida," "merienda" and "cena." This regime is based on rural work customs which required starting the day before the sun rose.<ref name="gastrogob"/> Typical dishes include those with [[iguana meat]], [[gar]] fish, beef puchero, smoked oysters, totopostes, pork with beans and tortillas made with banana and fresh corn.<ref name="atraccul"/> Chocolate is still found in preparations which have not changed since pre Hispanic times mostly as hot and cold beverages. The most common cold chocolate beverage is [[pozol]], served fresh or fermented.<ref name="atraccul"/><ref name="gastrogob"/> Each of the regions has certain specialties. [[Teapa Municipality|Teapa]] is known for its cheese and [[longaniza]] sausage. [[Jalpa de Méndez]] produces [[head cheese]], longaniza sausage and another cured meat called [[botifarra|butifarra]]. [[Macuspana]]'s dishes are often based on ingredients from the area's rivers such as bass, turtle and gar. Paraíso is known for its oysters, often cooked in their shell over an open flame. [[Jalapa, Tabasco|Jalapa]] is known for its sweets such as sweetened fruits in corn husks, often accompanied by a cacao and corn beverage called chorote.<ref name="gastrogob"/>

Tabasco is host to the boating marathon called the Mundo Maya on the Usumacinta and Grijalva rivers.<ref name="actecon"/>

Most are located in the [[Villahermosa, Tabasco|Villahermosa]] area but others can be found in [[Comalcalco]], [[Huimanguillo]], Balancán, [[Emiliano Zapata Municipality, Tabasco|Emiliano Zapata]], [[Jalpa de Méndez]], [[Jonuta]] and [[Teapa]]. These include the Carlos Pellicer Museum (anthropology) Museum of Popular Culture, Museum of History and the La Venta site museum.<ref name="atraccul"/>

Patron saint days are still popular events in the state, with some of the more notable being San Isidro in Comalcalco and [[Nacajuca]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James the Greater]] in Chontalpa, Our Lady of the Remedies in Nacajuca, [[Our Lady of the Assumption]] in Cupilco, [[Francis of Assisi]] in {{Interlanguage link|Tamulté de las Sabanas|es}}, events related with [[Lent]] in Atasta and Tamulté and the Saint Sebastian in Tenosique.

[[La Venta]] was the most important civic-religious center of the Olmec civilization, the first major culture of Mesoamerica. The site shows a number of the characteristics of Olmec culture, including depictions of jaguars, [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal heads]] and images of figures of rotund children.

[[Comalcalco]] is a Maya archeological site near the modern city of the same name, on a bank of the Mezcalapa River. While it is not the only Mayan city whose monumental architecture is of adobe brick instead of stone, it is the only one which has had extensive reconstruction, and is open to the public. The Mayas here used adobe because of the lack of building stone in the area, instead using the abundant clay and lime extracted from shells. The Mayan city developed between 800 and 1100 AD, contemporary with [[Palenque]] and [[Yaxchilan]]. The name of the site comes from Nahuatl and means place of [[comal (cookware)|comal]]s (a kind of cooking pan), but its Mayan name was Hoi Chan, which means "cloudy sky". The site covers 577 hectares and with a total of 282 structures. The main monuments are La Plaza Norte, La Gran Acropolis and the Eastern Acropolis.<ref name="comalcalcogob"/>

[[Pomoná]] is a Mayan site discovered in 1959. The city was established in the Classic period, achieving its height in the late Classic and falling in the early Post Classic. It is on the Usumacinta River, giving it an important role in the political and economic relations of the time, as many ocean products passed through here on their way to the [[Petén Department|Peten]] area. Its original name is not known and it is currently named after a nearby modern settlement. It has six important groups of buildings with residential areas extending over 175 hectares.<ref name="pomonagob">{{cite web |url=http://www.tabasco.gob.mx/turismo/arqueologia.php?arqueologia=34 |title=Pomoná |publisher=State of Tabasco |access-date=December 31, 2011 |language=es |trans-title=Pomoná |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229225033/http://www.tabasco.gob.mx/turismo/arqueologia.php?arqueologia=34 |archive-date=December 29, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The main plazas with their ceremonial structures are similar to those found in [[Tikal]] and the towers of [[Río Bec]]. There are seven principal structures surrounded by numerous smaller ones.
