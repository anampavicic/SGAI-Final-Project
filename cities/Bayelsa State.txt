== History ==
During the 20th century, demanding a new, majority-Ijaw state to be drawn in the [[Niger Delta]] Region became common. Between 1941 and 1956, numerous Ijaw nationalist organizations supportive of an Ijaw-majority state in Southern Nigeria were founded. [[Isaac Adaka Boro]], a prominent Ijaw rights activist during the 1960s who was born in [[Oloibiri]], attempted to proclaim a "Niger Delta Peoples Republic" in 1966.<ref>{{Cite book|last=T.|first=Akinyele, R.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/752210539|title=Isaac Adaka Boro: patriarch of minority activism in the Niger Delta|date=2006|publisher=University of Lagos, Faculty of Arts|isbn=978-075-054-1|oclc=752210539}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Overview of Bayelsa State|url=https://www.nigerdeltabudget.org/new/index.php/overview-of-bayelsa-state|access-date=2021-03-09|website=Niger Delta Budget Monitoring Group|language=en-gb|archive-date=2021-04-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210422103532/https://www.nigerdeltabudget.org/new/index.php/overview-of-bayelsa-state|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Organ.|first=Thomson Reuters Herausgebendes|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/946102050|title=Social sciences citation index.|oclc=946102050}}</ref> Bayelsa State was created out of [[Rivers State]] on 1 October 1996<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bayelsa – History & Culture – Bayelsa State Government|url=https://bayelsastate.gov.ng/our-history/|access-date=2022-02-11|language=en-US}}</ref> by the [[Sani Abacha]]'s military government.

On 20 November 1999, the Nigerian military committed what is now referred to as the [[Odi massacre]].

===Environmental issues===

==== Soot pollution ====
This is a black hazardous [[carbonate]] substance that pollutes the area due to its illegal burning of crude oil (locally called Kpo-fire).<ref name=":3" /> This [[carcinogen]]ic chemical causes illnesses such as [[lung cancer]], skin irritation, [[Allergy|allergies]], [[respiratory tract infection]]s, eye problem, etc. Its effect is also meted on the environment as it causes [[air pollution]], [[soil pollution]], [[water pollution]] which has led to the death of both plants, humans and animals.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-12-28 |title=Anxiety as strange black soot envelops Yenagoa |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2021/12/anxiety-as-strange-black-soot-envelops-yenagoa/ |access-date=2022-04-01 |website=Vanguard News |language=en-US}}</ref>

==== Flooding ====
This is a common annual problem in Bayelsa because it is located on the coast of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The rise of seawater is the major cause. The flooding has affected many communities, properties and human lives.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Report |first=Agency |date=2018-09-16 |title=Flood hits Bayelsa communities, settlements, renders many homeless |url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/south-south-regional/284002-flood-hits-bayelsa-communities-settlements-renders-many-homeless.html |access-date=2022-10-01 |website=Premium Times Nigeria |language=en-GB}}</ref> Almost all areas in Bayelsa state are affected by flooding but [[Ekeremor]], [[Southern Ijaw]], [[Sagbama]], [[Kolokuma/Opokuma]] and [[Yenagoa]] areas of Bayelsa state are more prone to flooding as it affects these areas yearly.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-09-09 |title=Diri faults NEMA's report, insists entire Bayelsa is flood-prone |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/09/diri-faults-nemas-report-insists-entire-bayelsa-is-flood-prone/ |access-date=2022-04-04 |website=Vanguard News |language=en-US}}</ref> Poor town planning is another major cause of flooding in Bayelsa State.<ref>{{Cite web |last=News Express |title=Environmentalists identify cause of flooding in Yenagoa |url=https://www.newsexpressngr.com/news/41887-Environmentalists-identify-cause-of-flooding-in-Yenagoa |website=News Express}}</ref>

As of August 2022, the state was stricken with a flood, displacing over 1.3 million people and destroying livestock and properties.

==== Oil spillage ====
This is one of the major environmental issues in Bayelsa State due to the activities of major oil companies.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nwafor |date=2021-11-27 |title=Oil spill: We can't breathe, we're dying of hunger — Bayelsa communities lament |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2021/11/oil-spill-we-cant-breathe-were-dying-of-hunger-bayelsa-communities-lament/ |access-date=2022-10-01 |website=Vanguard News |language=en-GB}}</ref> [[Oil spillage]] has affected farmlands, aquatic life and the health of the people.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-11-27 |title=Oil spill: We can't breathe, we're dying of hunger — Bayelsa communities lament |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2021/11/oil-spill-we-cant-breathe-were-dying-of-hunger-bayelsa-communities-lament/ |access-date=2022-03-25 |website=Vanguard News |language=en-US}}</ref> Almost every day, Udengs Eradiri is informed of another oil spill in Bayelsa state, in the Niger Delta.

He said Bayelsa used to be green, you could go to a farm or go fishing and have a very impressive harvest. You would spend hours in the water and have a handful of fish. Today, he added, you can spend the whole day without catching a glimpse of a fish.<ref name="theguardian.com">{{Cite web |date=2019-12-06 |title='This place used to be green': the brutal impact of oil in the Niger Delta |url=http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/dec/06/this-place-used-to-be-green-the-brutal-impact-of-oil-in-the-niger-delta |access-date=2022-03-25 |website=the Guardian |language=en}}</ref>

Another major environmental issue in Bayelsa state is air pollution (SOOT). Today, many people in Bayelsa state lament that they cannot breathe due to the exposure of emissions of soot, a hazardous black [[amorphous carbon]] that has almost completely polluted the air in the areas.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |date=2022-01-05 |title=Soot pollution in Rivers, Bayelsa: All hands must be on deck |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/01/soot-pollution-in-rivers-bayelsa-all-hands-must-be-on-deck/ |access-date=2022-03-25 |website=Vanguard News |language=en-US}}</ref>

However, stakeholders in the affected areas had in 2018 reportedly initiated a campaign with the common refrain; "Save Rivers from this soot of death", in the [[Rivers State|Rivers state]] region.<ref name="theguardian.com"/>

== Natural resources ==
Bayelsa State's [[natural resource]]s include:<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ikenwa |first=Chizoba |date=2020-01-13 |title=List of Natural Mineral Resources Found in Bayelsa State |url=https://nigerianinfopedia.com.ng/natural-resources-found-in-bayelsa-state/ |access-date=2023-01-06 |website=Nigerian Infopedia |language=en-US}}</ref>
