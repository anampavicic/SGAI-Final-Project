'''Chonburi''' ({{Langx|th|ชลบุรี}}, {{RTGS|''Chon Buri''}}, {{IPA|th|tɕ͡ʰōn bū.rīː||th-chonburi.ogg}}) is a [[Provinces of Thailand|province of Thailand]] (''changwat'') located in [[Eastern Thailand#Administrative divisions|eastern Thailand]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About Chon Buri|url=https://www.tourismthailand.org/About-Thailand/Destination/Chon-Buri|website=Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT)|access-date=31 May 2015}}</ref> Its capital is also named Chonburi. Neighbouring provinces are (clockwise from north) [[Chachoengsao province|Chachoengsao]], [[Chanthaburi province|Chanthaburi]], and [[Rayong province|Rayong]], while the [[Bay of Bangkok]] is to the west. [[Pattaya]], a major tourism destination in Thailand, is located in Chonburi, along with [[Laem Chabang]], the country's primary seaport. The population of the province has grown rapidly and now totals 1.7 million residents, although a large portion of the population is floating or unregistered.<ref name="citypopulation"/> The registered population as of 31 December 2018 was 1.535 million.<ref name="TDD" />

==Toponymy==
The Thai word ''chon'' ({{lang|th|ชล}} /{{IPA|t͡ɕʰon˧}}/) originates from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''{{IAST|jalá}}'' ({{lang|sa|जल}})  meaning "water", and the word ''buri'' ({{lang|th|บุรี;}} /{{IPA|bu˨˩.riː˧}}/) from Sanskrit ''{{IAST|purī}}'' ({{lang|sa|पुरी}});  meaning "town" or "city"; hence the name of the province means "city of water".  The local Chinese name for the province is {{zh|c=萬佛歲|poj=Bān-pu̍t-sòe|labels=no}}, which is a rendering of "Bang Pla Soi" ({{lang|th|บางปลาสร้อย}}) the former name of [[Mueang Chonburi district]], the capital district of Chonburi province (this name is retained for one of Mueang Chonburi's subdistricts.)  The standard Chinese name for the province is a phonetic rendering of "Chonburi", {{zh|c=春武里|poj=Chhun-bú-lí|labels=no}}.

== History ==
Human habitation of the province dates back to the Neolithic era, when early inhabitants lived in the area along the Panthong river in modern day Phan Thong district.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=History |url=http://www.chonburimots.go.th/en/about-us/chonburi-info/history/83-english/chonburi-info.html |access-date=2023-09-10 |website=สำนักงานการท่องเที่ยวและกีฬาจังหวัดชลบุรี |language=en-gb}}</ref> 

During the [[Dvaravati]] period, the city of Mueang Phra Rot (Phra That Noen That) was established close to the mouth of the Bang Pakong river in modern-day Phanat Nikhom District. The city was in the shape of an irregular rectangle and was surrounded by a moat. Mueang Phra Rot was established from the 600s to the 1000s and had goods imported from the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song dynasties]] and from either [[Persia]] or [[lower Mesopotamia]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mueang Phra Rot - Archeological site |url=https://www.routeyou.com/en-th/location/view/51155944/mueang-phra-rot |access-date=2023-09-10 |website=RouteYou |language=en}}</ref> 

To the east of Phra Rot was Mueang Sri Phalo in modern-day Nong Mai Daeng, which was established near the end of Phra Rot in the 1000s.<ref name=":1" /> Located near the mouth of the [[Bang Pakong River|Bang Pakong river]], it became a wealthy port and fishing town, serving as a stopping point for Khmer, Vietnamese and Chinese [[Barque|barques]] before they ventured into the [[Chao Phraya River|Chao Phraya river]].<ref name=":0" /> However, it lost prominence in the 1300s when the mouth of the river became shallower due to sedimentation. As a result in the town's economy declining, its inhabitants moved south to Bang Pla Soi. Construction of Sukhimvit road erased the town's eastern wall.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=Mueang Sri Phalo - Archeological site |url=https://www.routeyou.com/en-th/location/view/51157203/mueang-sri-phalo |access-date=2023-09-10 |website=RouteYou |language=en}}</ref>

=== Late 19th century to present ===
In the reign of King Nangklao, [[Rama III]], Phra Intha-asa, The Governor of Phanat Nikhom I (Princely member of Nakhon Phanom royal family) took many immigrants (Nakhon Phanom Laotians, Named Lao Asa Pak Nam) from Samut Prakan and New Nakhon Phanom Laotians to Phanat Nikhom. The Siamese King at the time allowed them to establish a habitat between Chonburi and Chachoengsao (Named Phanat Nikhom in the present).

[[Songkran (Thailand)|Songkran]] day in [[Bangsaen]] (''Ko Phra Sai Wan Lai Bangsaen'') is a tradition that has been held continuously for over ten years at Bang Saen Beach and Laem Thaen. The event takes place between April 16–17 of each year. The highlight of this event is a contest in which the contestants build a sand Buddha at Bangsaen Beach. In each Buddha sand arch is a decoration. The combination of the sea atmosphere and Thai decorations has helped this become one of the most popular Songkran festivals in Thailand. Other activities also take place, such as meriting [[alms]] to monks, bathing Buddha images, pouring water on the elders, traditional sporting events, sea boxing competitions, and oyster sheep competitions. Seafood and local food are often sold, along with other local products as part of [[One Tambon One Product]] (OTOP). Well-known artists have also given concerts at the event.
