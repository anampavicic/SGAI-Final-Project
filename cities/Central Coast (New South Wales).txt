The '''Central Coast''' is a [[peri-urbanisation|peri-urban]] region lying on the [[Pacific Ocean]] in northern-eastern [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. The region is situated north of [[Sydney]], which is filled with [[subtropical]] national parks, forests and also encompasses the major coastal waterways of [[Brisbane Water]], [[Tuggerah Lakes]] and southern [[Lake Macquarie (New South Wales)|Lake Macquarie]]. The region's hinterland, which has fertile valleys, rural farmland and wineries, and also includes the [[Watagan Mountains]]. The Central Coast is known for its regional coastal towns like [[Terrigal]], [[The Entrance, New South Wales|The Entrance]], [[Ettalong Beach]], [[Budgewoi]] and [[Bateau Bay]] with resorts and holiday parks, which feature many expansive beaches and lagoons with surfing and coastal tracks, as well as scenic views. [[Gosford]] is the main commercial hub and gateway.

The Central Coast includes major localities, villages and towns such as Gosford, [[Wyong, New South Wales|Wyong]], Terrigal, [[Woy Woy, New South Wales|Woy Woy]] and The Entrance. The area is the [[List of cities in Australia by population#50 largest urban centres by population|third-largest urban area]] in New South Wales and the ninth-largest urban area in Australia. Geographically, the Central Coast is generally considered to include the region bounded by the [[Hawkesbury River]] in the south, the [[Watagan Mountains]] in the west and the southern end of [[Lake Macquarie (New South Wales)|Lake Macquarie]], lying on the [[Sydney basin]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/central-coast|title= Central Coast|publisher= VisitNSW.com|access-date= 11 October 2013|url-status= live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131021050707/http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/central-coast|archive-date= 21 October 2013}}</ref>

== History ==
The region has been inhabited for thousands of years by Aboriginal people. The local [[Kuringgai]] people were the first Aboriginal people to come in contact with British settlers. An Aboriginal man from the region named [[Bungaree]] became one of the most prominent people of the early settlement of New South Wales. He was one of the first Aboriginal people to learn English and befriended the early governors Phillip, King and Macquarie.<ref>Karskens, Grace, ''The Colony: The History of Early Sydney'', Allen & Unwin 2010, {{ISBN|9781742373645}}</ref> He accompanied explorer [[Matthew Flinders]] in circumnavigating Australia.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/bungaree-1848|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|first=F.

In addition to Kuringgai-speaking people (referred to as the "Pittwater tribes" and "Broken Bay tribes" by early colonists), [[Awabakal]] lived around [[Lake Macquarie]], and [[Darkinyung people]] lived inland, to the west of the [[Mooney Mooney Creek]]. The [[Kuringgai language|Kuringgai]] (Guriŋgai), [[Awabakal language|Awaba]] and [[Darkinyung]] languages are related to each other, but are distinct from the Dharrug and Sydney languages that were spoken south of the Central Coast.<ref name="Oceania">{{Cite journal| issn = 0029-8077| volume = 41| issue = 1| pages = 20–27| last = Capell| first = A.| authorlink = Arthur Capell| title = Aboriginal Languages in the South Central Coast, New South Wales: Fresh Discoveries| journal = Oceania| date = 1970| doi = 10.1002/j.1834-4461.1970.tb01112.x| jstor = 40329895| url = https://www.jstor.org/stable/40329895}}</ref> Post-settlement disease, disruption and [[Australian frontier wars|war]] greatly reduced the numbers of Aboriginal people.

In 1811, the [[Governor of New South Wales]], [[Lachlan Macquarie]], gave the first [[land grant]] in the region to William Nash, a former marine of the [[First Fleet]]. No further grants were made in the area until 1821.<ref>Bennett, F. C., ''The Story of the Aboriginal People of the Central Coast of New South Wales'', Brisbane Water Historical Society, 1968, p. 9.</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Woy Woy Bay from Spion Kop (2).jpg|left|thumb|[[Woy Woy Bay, New South Wales|Woy Woy Bay]] from Spion Kop, with various suburbs in the background]]
The region is a network of towns that have been linked in recent years by expanding suburban development. The main urban cluster of the region surrounds the northern shore of [[Brisbane Water]] and includes the Coast's largest population centre, [[Gosford, New South Wales|Gosford]], stretching east to the retail centre of [[Erina, New South Wales|Erina]]. Other major commercial "centres" on the Coast are [[Wyong, New South Wales|Wyong]], [[Tuggerah, New South Wales|Tuggerah]], Lakehaven, [[The Entrance, New South Wales|The Entrance]], [[Terrigal, New South Wales|Terrigal]], [[Bateau Bay]] and [[Woy Woy]].

On 2 December 2005, the Central Coast was officially recognised as a stand-alone region rather than an extension of [[Greater Sydney]] or the [[Hunter Region|Hunter Valley]], a few years after the Central Coast got its definition, it officially got recognised to be part of Regional NSW instead of Greater Sydney by the NSW Government.<ref name="gnb-cc">{{NSW GNR|id=MnqwBKrXMn|title=Central Coast|access-date=2008-05-07}}</ref>

===Climate===
The Central Coast has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: Cfa), with warm humid summers and mild winters. Rainfall is spread fairly evenly throughout the year, but is slightly more frequent during autumn.{{cn|date=May 2024}} Winter is the driest time, with often minimal to no rain.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

==Population==
[[File:Woy Woy from the air - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Suburbs such as [[Woy Woy, New South Wales|Woy Woy]] are some of the more populated areas of the Central Coast region]]
The [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] publishes population census data and regular population estimates on the Central Coast under a Significant Urban Area. In 2021, the estimated population of this region was 343,180,<ref>{{Cite web |title=2021 Central Coast, Census All persons QuickStats {{!}} Australian Bureau of Statistics |url=https://www.abs.gov.au/census/find-census-data/quickstats/2021/1010 |access-date=2023-05-27 |website=www.abs.gov.au}}</ref> with population forecasts projecting it will grow by more than 20 per cent to 415,050 by 2035.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.centralcoast.nsw.gov.au/council/about-council |title=About Council |website=Central Coast Council About Page |date=16 March 2018 |publisher=Central Coast Council |access-date=31 July 2020}}</ref>

The median age was 43, with an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population of 4.9%.<ref>{{Cite web |title=2021 Central Coast, Census All persons QuickStats {{!}} Australian Bureau of Statistics |url=https://www.abs.gov.au/census/find-census-data/quickstats/2021/1010 |access-date=2023-05-27 |website=www.abs.gov.au}}</ref> The main countries of birth were Australia (78.9%), United Kingdom (4.6%), and New Zealand (1.7%). [[Australian Bureau of Statistics|ABS]] currently includes the Central Coast region population wholly within [[Greater Sydney]] which results in Greater Sydney's population being larger than that of Greater Melbourne, however the NSW government definition for the Central Coast region it has its own regional population definition as a stand alone region.

==Education==
The Central Coast has two campuses of the [[University of Newcastle, Australia|University of Newcastle]] located at [[Ourimbah, New South Wales|Ourimbah]] and [[Gosford Hospital]].

Fixed-line telephone service is universally available. [[3G]], [[4G]] and [[5G]] mobile network services are available from [[Optus]], [[Telstra]] and [[Vodafone Australia|Vodafone]], though numerous black spots exist due to the topography and remoteness of some parts of the region. Steps to improve coverage areas along the railway have been announced by the Federal Government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.itnews.com.au/news/turnbull-pledges-12m-to-mobile-coverage-for-central-coast-trains-421232|title=Turnbull pledges $12m to mobile coverage for Central Coast trains|website=iTnews|access-date=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117122447/https://www.itnews.com.au/news/turnbull-pledges-12m-to-mobile-coverage-for-central-coast-trains-421232|archive-date=17 November 2017}}</ref>

ADSL and good quality fixed-wireless broadband services are widely available; however, significant blackspots continue to exist. High speed ADSL2 is available at most exchanges through Telstra. Few other providers exist, leading to an expensive high speed broadband offering for the region. Many areas experience very slow and/or unreliable ADSL connections due to the age and quality of the infrastructure.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

Fibre optic based broadband services are available in some areas serviced by the National Broadband Network NBN. These include [[Kincumber]], [[Gosford]], [[East Gosford]], [[West Gosford]], [[Springfield, New South Wales (Central Coast)|Springfield]], [[Berkeley Vale, New South Wales|Berkeley Vale]], [[Tumbi Umbi]] and [[Long Jetty]].{{cn|date=April 2024}}

In 2011, the region was selected as one of the early roll out regions for the [[National Broadband Network]]'s fibre to the premise installation which will offer stable speeds of 100/40&nbsp;Mbit/s down/up load respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nbnco.com.au/corporate-information/media-centre/media-releases/gosford-switches-on-to-nbn.html |title=NSW Central Coast commuters tipped to take to teleworking in Gosford &#124; NBN - Australia's new broadband access network |access-date=2017-11-17 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117122626/https://www.nbnco.com.au/corporate-information/media-centre/media-releases/gosford-switches-on-to-nbn.html |archive-date=2017-11-17 }}</ref> Two Points Of Interconnect (POI) are located in the region at Gosford and Berkley Vale exchanges. The regional rollout will radiate out from these two super exchanges. Services in areas around the two POI are now available.
The rollout of the NBN to the remainder of the region is in question following a change of government in September 2013. Trials of fibre to the node technology are planned for Umina Beach and Woy Woy.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

==Governance==
The Central Coast is administered by one [[Local government areas of New South Wales|local government area]] which is the [[Central Coast Council (New South Wales)|Central Coast Council]].

==Transport==
The Central Coast is serviced by an extensive and burgeoning road system. A combination of bus and rail provide limited [[public transport]] options for locals. The region also has a number of taxis operated by Central Coast Taxis. Transport has been a constant issue for the region and has been cited as high a priority over the last 20 years{{which|date=April 2024}} in regional plans and priorities by local, state and federal government agencies, with incremental investments largely in road infrastructure.

===Roads===

; Pacific Motorway (Sydney - Newcastle Freeway)
The main access to the Central Coast by road is by the {{convert|127|km|mi|0}} [[Pacific Motorway (Sydney-Newcastle)|Pacific Motorway]] that carries the designation [[National Highway (Australia)|National Highway 1]]. From January 2013 it officially has been renamed as the M1 Pacific Motorway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadprojects/projects/alpha_numeric/sydney.html|title=Projects|work=[[Roads & Maritime Services]]|access-date=16 October 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615162035/http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadprojects/projects/alpha_numeric/sydney.html|archive-date=15 June 2013}}</ref> The freeway provides the most important road link between [[Sydney]] and the northern areas of New South Wales such as Central Coast, [[Hunter Region|Hunter]], [[Mid North Coast]] and [[Northern Rivers]].

;Central Coast Highway
The roads that link Kariong with Doyalson (Pacific Highway, Dane Drive, Masons Parade, York Street, George Street, The Entrance Road, Oakland Avenue, Coral Street, Wilfred Barrett Drive, Budgewoi Road and Scenic Road) became known as the [[Central Coast Highway]] from 9 August 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/constructionmaintenance/majorconstructionprojectsregional/centralcoast/kariong-doyalson.html|title=Kariong to Doyalson|publisher=[[Roads & Traffic Authority]]|date=2008-01-23|access-date=2008-05-07 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080102183007/http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/constructionmaintenance/majorconstructionprojectsregional/centralcoast/kariong-doyalson.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2008-01-02}}</ref>

The Central Coast's roads are maintained by the Central Coast Council as well as state roads by the NSW government; however, due to the relatively large geography maintenance issues often arise.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

===Rail===
[[File:Gosford Railway Station.jpg|thumb|Main entrance of [[Gosford railway station]]]]
The western and south-eastern towns and suburbs of the Central Coast are on the [[Main Northern railway line]]. The rail line is primarily used to provide mass transport for those that commute to Sydney or Newcastle and as such services are most frequent during peak commuter times (typically one hour before Sydney and Newcastle peak times in the morning and one hour after in the evening due to the distance). Gosford station is the largest and main railway station in the region, which is considered a rest stop for long rail services to [[Sydney]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]], [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]], [[Taree, New South Wales|Taree]], [[Port Macquarie]], [[Coffs Harbour]], [[Grafton, New South Wales|Grafton]], [[Casino, New South Wales|Casino]], [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] and [[Brisbane]]. The line has connections with most bus services as well as taxis. Trains terminate at both Gosford and Wyong stations which are also utilised by long-distance services.

Central Coast railway stations on the Northern NSW line are (from south to north):

Its services also operate to West Gosford, [[Wyoming, New South Wales|Wyoming]], [[Holgate, New South Wales|Holgate]], [[Matcham, New South Wales|Matcham]], [[Point Frederick, New South Wales|Point Frederick]] and [[Springfield, New South Wales (Central Coast)|Springfield]]. Although most services operate to/from Wyong Hospital via [[Berkeley Vale, New South Wales|Berkeley Vale]] and [[Westfield Tuggerah]], one service (Route 29) operates from Bay Village to Wyong Hospital via The Entrance, Magenta Shores, Toukley, Gorokan and Lake Haven. Red Bus have around 25 buses that are suitable for wheelchairs.

Route 11 is the most popular service, linking Lake Haven with Warnervale via Hamlyn Terrace and Woongarah. This service on weekdays occasionally extends to Westfield Tuggerah and Wyong Station via Hue Hue Road.

CDC NSW operate services between Cheero Point, Mooney Mooney with the bus line extending to Sydney areas such as Brooklyn and sometimes as far as Hornsby. The bus route is isolated from rest of the Central Coast bus network.<ref>{{Cite web |title={{!}} transportnsw.info |url=https://transportnsw.info/routes/details/cdc-nsw-r14/592/37592 |access-date=2024-03-13 |website=transportnsw.info}}</ref>

Other smaller local shopping malls are located throughout the region, including at Woy Woy, Umina Beach, Kincumber, Gosford, Wyoming, Bateau Bay, Wyong and Lake Haven.

== Notes ==
{{NoteFoot
|notes =
{{NoteTag|name=distances|These figures are the distances from Sydney and Newcastle to Gosford, the major population hub in the region.
<!-- The geographical centre of the Central Coast, according to the NSW Geographical Names Board, is a point just west of Wisemans Ferry Road at Mangrove Mountain, well away from the region's major population centres. It seems more relevant to provide distances to the major population centre within the region than to this insignificant point. -->}}
