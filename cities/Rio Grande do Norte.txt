It is located in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|northeastern region]] of the country, forming the northeasternmost tip of the South American continent. The name literally translates as "Great Northern River", referring to the mouth of the [[Potenji River]].

The capital and largest city is [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]]. The state has 410&nbsp;km (254&nbsp;mi) of [[sand]]y [[beach]]es and contains [[Rocas Atoll]], the only [[atoll]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The main economic activity is tourism, followed by the [[extraction of petroleum]] (the second largest producer in the country), agriculture, fruit growing and extraction of minerals, including considerable production of [[seasalt]], among other economic activities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tribunadonorte.com.br/noticia.php?id=104733 |title=Notícia inválida |publisher=Tribuna do Norte |access-date=13 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006071646/http://tribunadonorte.com.br/noticia.php?id=104733 |archive-date=6 October 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The state is home to 1.7% of the Brazilian population and produces 1% of the country's [[GDP]].

==Geography==
Rio Grande do Norte is dominated by its coastline. The state is famed for its beaches and [[sand dune]]s, and the air is, according to [[NASA]], the second-cleanest in the world after [[Antarctica]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Two climates predominate: humid tropical, in the oriental [[littoral]], and semi-arid, in the remaining (most part) of the State (including the North coast).
The rainforest which once covered most of Brazil's coast had its northern end in the south of Rio Grande do Norte; the area north of Natal, the capital, is under dunes, a kind of formation associated with semi-arid climate. The semi-arid climate is characterized not only by the low level but also the irregularity of rainfall; some years can go by with no or very little rain; most of the interior of the State is part of the Polygon of Droughts (an area which receives special attention from the federal government). There are also many [[mangrove]]s in the state, and the interior is dominated by [[rainforest]]. [[Rocas Atoll]] in the Atlantic Ocean, 260&nbsp;km Northeast of [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]], also belongs to the state of Rio Grande do Norte. It is contained in the fully protected [[Atol das Rocas Biological Reserve]].

==History==
{{further ill|History of Rio Grande do Norte|pt|História do Rio Grande do Norte}}
The first European to reach the region may have been the [[Spain|Spaniard]] [[Alonso de Ojeda]] in 1499. The northeastern tip of South America, [[Cape São Roque]], {{convert|20|mi|km}} to the north of Natal, was first officially visited by European navigators in 1501, in the 1501–1502 Portuguese expedition led by [[Amerigo Vespucci]], who named the spot after the [[Saint Roch|saint of the day]]. The Vespucci expedition also named the [[Potenji River|Potengi]] ([[Tupi language|Tupi]] for "River of Shrimps") river, whose considerably large mouth contrasted with the nearby bodies of water, "Rio Grande" (Portuguese for "Great River"), after which the [[Captaincy of Rio Grande|Captaincy]], Province, and State were named. For decades thereafter, no permanent European settlement was established in the area, inhabited by the [[Potiguar (tribe)|Potiguar]] tribe.
[[File:Natal-Coluna-Capitolina.jpg|thumb|left|Column Capitolina was donated to the state by Mussolini.]]
In the 16th century (between 1535 and 1598), it was explored by French pirates in search for [[brazilwood]]. In 1598, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] built the ''Forte dos Reis Magos'' and, in the following year, founded the city of [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]]. Rasing cattle and sugarcane plantation lifted the local development and economy.<ref>''Grande Enciclopédia Universal'', page 11442, "Rio Grande do Norte" paragraph 1</ref>

In 1633, the area became a battleground between the expansionist Portuguese, seeking to take more land for their Brazilian territories, and the Dutch, who gained a foothold in South America.

After a short period of peace and prosperity in [[Olinda]] and [[Recife]], the sugar prices went down in the market of Amsterdam and the region entered into a serious economic crisis. The economic problems led the Portuguese settlers and native Brazilians to revolt against the Dutch in what is known today as the massacres of [[Cunhaú]] and [[Uruaçu]].
[[File:Rampa-Natal.jpg|thumb|[[Rampa, Natal|Rampa]], one of the American air bases used during World War II.]]
The religious confrontations (the Portuguese-Brazilian Catholicism and the Dutch [[Calvinism]]), Portugal's restoration of the throne in 1640 and the reconquest of [[Maranhão]] in 1643, lead the Portuguese-Brazilians to undertake the 1645 uprising, led by [[André Vidal de Negreiros]] and [[João Fernandes Vieira]]. The governor of [[Bahia]] promised new Portuguese troops, but most of the rebels were Africans and Amerindians. In 1654, the Dutch were finally cast out.

During World War II, Rio Grande do Norte was used as an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] airbase from which to launch [[airstrike|air raids]] on German-occupied North Africa.

In 1964, Latin America's first [[space exploration|space launch]] site was constructed in Rio Grande do Norte; ''[[Barrier of Hell Launch Center|Barreira do Inferno]]'' (Hell's Barrier), which was often referred to as the "Brazilian [[NASA]]".

=== Education ===
[[File:Escola-de-Música-UFRN.jpg|thumb|right|[[Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte]] in Natal, considered one of the best in the country.]]
[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is the official national language, and thus the primary language taught in schools, but English and Spanish are part of the official high school curriculum.

====Educational institutions====
* Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN) (Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte);
* Universidade Estadual do Rio Grande do Norte (UERN) (State University of Rio Grande do Norte);
* Universidade Potiguar (UnP) (Potiguar University);
* Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Árido (Ufersa) (Rural Federal University of Semi-Arid);
* Instituto Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (IFRN) (Federal Institute of Rio Grande do Norte);
* and many others.

==Economy==
The [[service sector]] is the largest component of GDP at 65.2%, followed by the [[industrial sector]] at 30.2%. Agriculture represents 4.6% of GDP (2021). Rio Grande do Norte exports: fish and [[crustacean]] 30.5%, fruits 19.3%, [[woven]] of cotton 12.3%, petroleum 10.8%, [[cashew]] 8.5%, sugar 5.3%, chocolate 3.9%, [[sea salt]] 3.7% (2002).

Share of the Brazilian economy: 1.9% (2021).

Historically, Rio Grande do Norte has relied upon sugar and cattle for its livelihood. However, since the 1980s, the state government has realised that tourism is a lucrative industry, and more money is being poured into the construction of tourist resorts, and restoring colonial buildings in major cities.

Fruit is also grown in Rio Grande do Norte, with the state supplying 70% of Brazil's melons, and the state is famed for its [[mango]] and [[cashew]] fields. The world's largest cashew tree is located in the state; it has a [[circumference]] of 500 metres and occupies an area of 7,300&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>, making it 70 times the size of average cashew trees.  Rio Grande do Norte is also one of three Brazilian states that together produce the world's entire supply of [[carnauba]] wax.
==Infrastructure==
According to research by Fundação Dom Cabral, Rio Grande do Norte is the state with the second-best infrastructure in the Northeast Region and ninth in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nominuto.com/noticias/cidades/pesquisa-aponta-rn-como-o-2-estado-do-ne-com-melhor-infraestrutura/44660/ |title=Pesquisa aponta RN como o 2º estado do NE com melhor infraestrutura |publisher=Nominuto.com |date=24 October 2011 |access-date=13 November 2011}}</ref>
[[File:Natal airport.jpg|thumb|right|[[Greater Natal International Airport]].]]

===International Airport===
[[Augusto Severo International Airport|Augusto Severo Airport]] has ceased to be [[Greater Natal International Airport]] since summer 2014. The new airport, situated outside the city,<ref>[[:es:Aeropuerto Internacional de Grande Natal]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=September 2015}} is in São Gonçalo do Amarante.
Located virtually at sea level (169&nbsp;ft), with favorable weather and geographic conditions, [[Augusto Severo International Airport]] in Parnamirim is 18 kilometers from Natal (RN). It takes its name from Augusto Severo de Albuquerque Maranhão, a native son of that state who died in an accident in France in 1902. The airport has a total area of 11.3 thousand square meters and capacity for 1.2 million passengers a year. The installations and passenger terminals are air conditioned with equipment that can put out 630 tons of cooled air. With an area of 5.5 million square meters, the airport complex operates with 16,482 square meters of passenger and cargo terminals and administrative and maintenance installations. There are 6,224 meters of runways and 61.5 square meters of apron space, providing connections from the greater [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]] region to the main centers of the world.
The airport is the only one in the Northeast Region to receive charter flights from [[Scandinavia]].

===Port===
[[File:Porto de Natal aérea.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance of the Port of Natal]]
The '''Port of Natal''' is specialized in cold storage cargo such as fruit, fish and [[shrimp]], among others. It has its own customs facilities and is connected to Europe by direct navigation lines, mainly to the ports of [[Vigo]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[Sheerness]].

==Culture==
===Saint John's Day===
{{See also|Natal, Rio Grande do Norte#Culture and recreation}}
[[Festa Junina]] was introduced to Northeastern [[Brazil]] by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] for whom St John's day (also celebrated as [[Midsummer]] Day in several European countries), on 24 June, is one of the oldest and most popular celebrations of the year. Differently, of course, from what happens on the European [[Midsummer]] Day, the festivities in Brazil do not take place during the [[summer solstice]] but during the tropical [[winter solstice]]. The festivities traditionally begin after 12 June, on the eve of St Anthony's day, and last until the 29th, which is Saint Peter's day. During these fifteen days, there are [[bonfires]], [[fireworks]], and folk dancing in the streets. Once exclusively a rural festival, today in Brazil it is largely an urban festival during which people joyfully and theatrically mimic peasant stereotypes and clichés in a spirit of jokes and good times. Typical refreshments and dishes are served. Similar to during Carnival, these festivities involve costume-wearing (in this case, peasant costumes), dancing, heavy drinking, and visual spectacles (fireworks display and folk dancing). Like what happens on [[Midsummer]] and St John's Day in Europe, [[bonfires]] are a central part of these festivities in Brazil.

{{See also|List of Rio Grande do Norte state symbols}}
The [[flag of Rio Grande do Norte]] was adopted on 3 December 1957. It is based on a design by [[Luís da Câmara Cascudo]]. In the middle of the flag is the coat of arms of the state, which was adopted on 1 July 1909. It shows a sailing boat at the coast in the middle, representing the fishing and salt industries. Above it is a bar which shows two flowers on the sides and two cotton bolls in the center. To the sides of the shield are a [[coconut]] palm to the right and a carnauba palm to the left, connected by two branches of [[sugar cane]]. The star above represents the state as part of Brazil.
