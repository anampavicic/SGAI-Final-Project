The name of the settlement came from the local River [[Chitinka|Chita]].

Following the [[Decembrist revolt]] of 1825, from 1827 several of the Decembrists suffered [[exile]] to Chita.<ref name=EB1911/>
According to [[George Kennan (explorer)|George Kennan]], who visited the area in the 1880s, "Among the exiles in Chita were some of the brightest, most cultivated, most sympathetic men and women that we had met in Eastern Siberia."<ref name="Kennan">

When [[Richard Maack]] visited the city in 1855, he saw a wooden town, with one church, also wooden. He estimated Chita's population at under 1,000, but predicted that the city would soon experience fast growth, due to the upcoming [[Amur Annexation|annexation]] of the [[Amur River|Amur]] valley by Russia.<ref>{{citation

By 1885, Chita's population had reached 5,728,{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} and by 1897 it increased to 11,500.<ref name="gr" /> In 1897 the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] reached Chita; rail traffic from 1899 rapidly made Chita the transport hub and industrial centre of the [[Transbaikal]].

During the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], revolutionary socialists declared the [[Chita Republic]]. [[Tsarist autocracy|Tsarist]] government forces took control again in January 1906.

The Bolsheviks took power in Chita in February 1918. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] occupied Chita from September 1918 to 1920 in the course of the [[Siberian intervention]]. On behalf of the [[White movement]], Ataman [[Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov|Grigory Semyonov]]'s [[Eastern Okraina]] ruled from Chita for some few months in early 1920 with Japanese support. From October 1920 to November 1922 the city served as the capital of the [[Far Eastern Republic]], which became part of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]] in November 1922.

In 1945, the Soviet authorities held [[Puyi]], who had reigned (1908–1912, 1917) as the last [[Emperor of China]], and some of his associates as prisoners in the city, in a former [[sanatorium]] for officers.<ref>S. I. Kuznetsov and S. V.

==Geography==
Chita lies at the [[confluence]] of the [[Chita River|Chita]] and [[Ingoda River]]s, between the [[Yablonoi Mountains]] to the west and the [[Chersky Range (Transbaikalia)|Chersky Range]] to the east. Lake [[Kenon]] is located to the west, within the city limits, and the [[Ivan-Arakhley Lake System]] is a group of lakes lying about {{Convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of Chita.<ref name="GЕ">[[Google Earth]]</ref>

===Climate===
Chita experiences a dry-winter  borderline [[humid continental climate]]/[[subarctic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: '''Dwb/Dwc''') with very cold, very dry winters and warm, relatively wet summers. Despite the southerly latitude, it closely resembles the climate of [[Fairbanks, Alaska]].
