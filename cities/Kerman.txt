== History ==
{{see also|Timeline of Kerman}}
Kerman was founded as a defensive outpost, with the name '''[[Veh-Ardashir]]''', by [[Ardashir I]], founder of the [[Sasanian Empire]], in the 3rd century AD.<ref>{{cite web |url-status=live |first1=Xavier |last1=de Planhol |first2=Bernard |last2=Hourcade |title=KERMAN ii.

At first the city's relative isolation allowed [[Kharijites]] and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] to thrive there, but the Kharijites were wiped out in 698, and the population was mostly Muslim by 725. Already in the eighth century the city was famous for its manufacture of [[cashmere wool]] [[shawl]]s and other textiles. The [[Abbasid Caliphate]]'s authority [[Anarchy at Samarra|over the region was weak]], and power passed in the tenth century to the [[Buyid dynasty|Buyid emirs]]. The region and city fell to [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] in the late tenth century. The name Kerman was adopted at some point in the tenth century.<ref>A.H.T.

In 1793 [[Lotf Ali Khan]] defeated the [[Qajars]], and in 1794 he captured Kerman. But soon after he was besieged in Kerman for six months by [[Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar]]. When the city fell to Agha Mohammad Khan, angered by the popular support that Lotf Ali Khan had received,{{clarify|date=February 2015}}<!--Did Agha Mohammad Khan order this? Who was "angered"?

However, the Zoroastrians of Kerman who had been strong supporters of Lotf Ali Khan suffered the wrath of the founder of Qajar dynasty the most during this period.[[Image:Kerman Masjid Gate.jpg|thumb|left|220x220px|The Masjid gate through which Agha Mohammad Khan entered the city]]The present city of Kerman was rebuilt in the 19th century to the northwest of the old city, but the city did not return to its former size until the 20th century.

The only Iranian anthropology museum dedicated to Zoroastrianism is located in the Kerman's Fire Temple, showcasing the ancient history of Zoroastrians. The idea of launching the museum along with the library of Kerman's Zoroastrian Society came to light in 1983, when the head of the society, Parviz Vakhashouri, and the former head of the library, Mehran Gheibi, collected cultural heritage artifacts of Kerman's Zoroastrian community. These two officials added many other objects to this collection. The museum was officially inaugurated during Jashn-e Tirgan in 2005 by [[Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization|Iran's Cultural Heritage]], Handicrafts and Tourism Organization (ICHHTO).

Jashn-e Tirgan or Tiregan is an ancient Iranian rain festival observed on July 1. The festivity refers to archangel Tir (literally meaning arrow) or Tishtar (lightning), who appear in the sky to generate thunder and lightning for providing much needed rain.

The [[Sadeh]] ceremony is celebrated every year in Kerman.
