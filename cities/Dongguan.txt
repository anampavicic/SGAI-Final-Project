In the [[Pearl River Delta]] region Dongguan was the first urban area where joint production was implemented between village collectives, local [[Cadre system of the Chinese Communist Party|Chinese Communist Party cadre]], and foreign investors. In the 1990s this type of enterprise accounted for around 20 percent of all [[foreign direct investment]]s and approximately 50 percent of exports by the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC).<ref>{{cite book | editor1= Peter Herrle | editor2= Josefine Fokdal | editor3= Detlev Ipsen |title=Beyond Urbanism: Urban(izing) Villages and the Mega-urban Landscape in the Pearl River Delta in China |publisher= Lit |year=2014 |page=36 |isbn=9783643905529 }}</ref>

The [[Dongguan Science and Technology Museum]] opened in December 2005 and is the high tech commerce park in the Songshan Lake district, which opened in 2003. The museum is a partnership with the Global IT Academy of the [[Brea Olinda Unified School District]] in [[Southern California]], demonstrating the city's emphasis on attracting technology business. The city announced in 2005 a planned investment of US$500 million over five years for technology infrastructure improvements. The city administration is considered especially progressive in seeking [[foreign direct investment]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Among the investors were Brazilian shoe manufacturers.

While the city is the fourth largest export region in China, behind [[Shanghai]], [[Shenzhen]], and [[Suzhou]], Dongguan has yet to gain the kind of name recognition realized by Shenzhen outside of China. This may be because the city has focused on infrastructure investment rather than the direct targeting of major corporations with financial incentives for economic development. Nevertheless, Dongguan has been identified by high level representatives of the [[National Development and Reform Commission]] of the central government as one of the most significant growth regions for technology in the coming years. As part of this plan, the Dongguan local government announced a plan to create and support a 100-billion-yuan photovoltaic manufacturing industry by 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thechinaperspective.com/articles/chinamarketpulseaviationpremiumincometourismlabormarket8088/index.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130203225911/http://www.thechinaperspective.com/articles/chinamarketpulseaviationpremiumincometourismlabormarket8088/index.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-02-03 |title=China Market Pulse |publisher=The China Perspective |date=2011-01-12 }}</ref>

To cope with the impact of the financial crisis, Dongguan city is looking to industrial restructuring, focusing on ''four pillar platforms'', these are governmental services, supporting measures, technology upgrade, and market expansion.

On 9 February 2014 [[China Central Television]] aired a special on the sex industry in Dongguan. The same day Guangdong Provincial Police raided and closed all saunas, bars, foot massages, karaokes, and other businesses associated with the sex industry. The economic impact of this crackdown is believed to be 50 billion yuan, or just over $8 billion US dollars. The residual effects of the crackdown affected the livelihood of taxi drivers and restaurants who, while not directly involved in the sex industry, benefited from the increased clientele.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1426442/dongguan-will-suffer-50b-yuan-loss-prostitution-crackdown-analysts|title=Prostitution clampdown on Dongguan may knock 50 billion yuan off its economy|date=12 February 2014|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=25 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602061308/http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1426442/dongguan-will-suffer-50b-yuan-loss-prostitution-crackdown-analysts|archive-date=2 June 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Nylander |first=Johan |date=2015-05-26 |title=Sex trade goes underground in China's 'sin city' |url=https://www.cnn.com/2015/05/25/asia/china-sin-city/index.html |website=CNN |language=en}}</ref>

The earliest traces of human habitation in the area stretch back 5,000 years. In 1839, at the outset of the [[First Opium War]], large quantities of [[Destruction of opium at Humen|seized opium were destroyed]] in [[Humen Town|Humen]], a town that now belongs to Dongguan. Several of the major battles of the war were fought in this area.{{citation needed||date=December 2023}}

==Demographics==
Dongguan had an estimated 6,949,800 inhabitants at the end of 2008, among whom 1,748,700 were local residents and 5,201,100 permanent migrants from other parts of the country.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://english.dg.gov.cn/POPULATION.htm |title=DongGuan - Population |access-date=2013-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022025853/http://english.dg.gov.cn/POPULATION.htm |archive-date=2011-10-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> At the 2010 Census the population had expanded to 8,220,237.<ref name="pop8.22m">{{Cite web |url=http://old.dongguantoday.com/newsc.asp?id=10332 |title=Donguan's population approaches 8.22 million |date=27 May 2011 |website=Dongguan Today |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001825/http://old.dongguantoday.com/newsc.asp?id=10332 |archive-date=31 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The number reached 10.5 million by 2020.<ref name="citypopulation.de" />

Dongguan is the hometown for many [[overseas Chinese]], the family origin of over 700,000 people in Hong Kong, [[Taiwan]] and Macau and over 200,000 Chinese nationals living abroad.

==Administration==
Dongguan is a [[prefecture-level city]] of the [[Guangdong]] [[Provinces of China|province]]. An uncommon administrative feature is that it has no [[County (People's Republic of China)|county-level]] division, but the municipal government does group the 32 township-level divisions into six district areas. The city government directly administers four [[Subdistricts of the People's Republic of China|Subdistricts]] and 28 [[Town of China|towns]]:
