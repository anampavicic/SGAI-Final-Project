'''Villeurbanne''' ({{IPA|fr|vilœʁban|-|LL-Q150 (fra)-Sebleouf-Villeurbanne.wav}}; {{lang-frp|Velorbana}}) is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Metropolis of Lyon]] in the [[Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes]] [[Regions of France|region]] in eastern [[France]].

It is situated northeast of [[Lyon]], with which it forms the heart of the second-largest metropolitan area in France after that of [[Paris]]. Villeurbanne is the second-largest commune in the metropolitan area of Lyon and the 20th most populated in France, and the most populous commune that is neither a prefecture nor a sub-prefecture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/3303318?sommaire=3353488|title=Villes et communes de France − Tableaux de l'économie française {{!}} Insee|website=www.insee.fr|access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref> In 2013, Villeurbanne was elected the city with the best administration of France, which attracts more and more people.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2021}}
The current location of downtown Villeurbanne is known to have been inhabited as far back as 6000 BC. Its current name comes from a [[Gallo-Roman]] farming area, established at about the same time as Lyon (then ''[[Lugdunum]]'') and known as the ''[[Roman villa|Villa]] Urbana'' ("town house"). It would then become ''Urbanum'', then ''Villa Urbane'' and, ultimately, ''Villeurbanne''.

Villeurbanne has belonged to the kingdom of France since 1349. It was then separated from La Guillotière (A former city lately incorporated into Lyon as the 3rd, 6th, 7th and 8th Arrondissement) by the river [[La Rize]], a former branch of the [[Rhône]] River.

Until the 19th century, the city was merely a patchwork of distinct villages separated by fields and undeveloped land. These villages have mostly survived, and nowadays form the neighborhoods of Charpennes, Cusset, Croix-Luizet, Maisons-Neuves, etc.

With the industrial era, Villeurbanne's economy soared: the textile industry was the first to bloom, followed by mechanical and chemical ones. The factories lured in numerous immigrants, most notably from Italy.

===20th century===
Transforming from a rural community to an industrial town, Villeurbanne underwent a tremendous demographic boom in the late 1920s. From 3,000 inhabitants in 1928, its population rocketed to 82,000 in 1931. Mayor [[Lazare Goujon]] (elected 1924) engaged the city in a vast public works initiative. Arguably the most visible heritage of this program is the {{ill|Gratte-Ciel|fr|Gratte-ciel (Villeurbanne)}}, a housing complex made up of two [[Art Deco]] towers and annex smaller buildings, lining up along the Avenue Henri Barbusse. These structures built between 1924 and 1934 are the work of architect [[Môrice Leroux]], with a contribution of Tony Garnier. They are one of the most notable Art Deco structures in France and the 19-story twin towers have become an emblem of the city.

Villeurbanne city hall was built by [[Robert Giroud]], a disciple of [[Tony Garnier (architect)]] and friend of Môrice Leroux.
