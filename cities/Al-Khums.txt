'''Al-Khums''' or '''Khoms''' ({{langx|ar|ÿßŸÑÿÆŸÖÿ≥}}) is a [[List of cities in Libya|city]], port and the [[de jure]] capital of the [[Murqub District]] on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast of [[Libya]]<ref>Staff (1972) "Al Khums" ''Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary'' (3rd ed.) Merriam, Springfield, Mass., p. 33, {{OCLC|11616186}}</ref> with an estimated population of around 202,000.<ref name=wolfram/> The population at the 1984 census was 38,174.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/317074/Al-Khums|title=Al-Khums - Libya}}</ref> Between 1983 and 1995 it was the administrative center of [[Al Khums District|al-Khums District]].

==Etymology==

The name ''al-Khums'' or ''Khoms'' ({{langx|ar|ÿßŸÑÿÆŸèŸÖÿ≥ }})<ref name="Fisher, Morris 1985 page 88">Fisher, Morris (1985) ''Provinces and provincial capitals of the world'' (2nd edition) Scarecrow Press, Metuchen, New Jersey, page 88, {{ISBN|0-8108-1758-6}}</ref> translated literally to "[[wikt:quintile|the quintile]]" in Arabic.<ref name="libyan4native.wordpress.com">{{cite web|url=https://libyan4native.wordpress.com/%D8%A7%D8%B5%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D9%85%D8%B3/|title=ÿßŸÑÿÆŸÖÿ≥|date=18 September 2014|access-date=3 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201121742/https://libyan4native.wordpress.com/%d8%a7%d8%b5%d9%88%d9%84-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%ae%d9%85%d8%b3/|archive-date=1 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>
The origin of the name is not clear. Several hypotheses include:

* In [[Tripolitania]] the [[quinary|quinary numeral system]] was used in contrary to most other [[Arabs|Arabic cultures]], which used the [[decimal|decimal system]]. Khums and neighbouring villages were famous in producing [[olives]] and [[olive oil]]. Since the olives had to be counted, residents of other cities started to call the inhabitants 'Khumsi' (Quinary), from which the name Khums derived.<ref name="libyan4native.wordpress.com"/> 
* Khums could be an Arabic translation to the Greek word [[Pentapolis]] which means five cities, but this hypothesis is dubious, because Pentapolis and its cities are in [[Cyrenaica]].<ref name="libyan4native.wordpress.com"/>
* Another hypothesis is that during the 16th century, al-Khums produced a quintile (20%) of the [[Ottoman Tripolitania]] province's olive oil.<ref name="libyan4native.wordpress.com"/> 
During the [[Italian Libya|Italian occupation of Libya]], the city was called Homs in official Italian sources.

==History==

===Leptis Magna===
{{Main|Leptis Magna}}
The city was founded by the [[Phoenicia]]ns around 1000 BCE, who gave it the name ''Lpqy''. Written LPQ ([[Punic language|Punic]]: ê§ãê§êê§í) or LPQY (ê§ãê§êê§íê§â). This has been tentatively connected to the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[Triliteral root|root]] (present in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) LFG, meaning "to build" or "to piece together", presumably in reference to the construction of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/183 |title=Archaeological Site of Leptis Magna |work=World Heritage List |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |access-date=March 14, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Birley-2">Birley, Anthony Richard (1971) ''Septimius Severus'' Eyre and Spottiswoode, London, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pcyPrVltTEkC&pg=PA2 page 2], {{ISBN|0-413-26900-0}}</ref>

The town did not become prominent until [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] became a major power in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the 4th century BCE. It nominally remained part of Carthage's dominions until the end of the [[Third Punic War]] in 146 BCE and then became part of the [[Roman Republic]].

Soon [[Roman citizenship|Roman]] merchants settled in the city and started a profitable commerce with the Libyan interior.<ref>{{cite book|author=Silvia Bullo|title=Provincia Africa: le citt√† e il territorio dalla caduta di Cartagine a Nerone|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3gQbIhDjkqkC&pg=PA167|year=2002|publisher=L'ERMA di BRETSCHNEIDER|isbn=978-88-8265-168-8|page=167}}</ref> The republic of Rome sent some colonists together with a small garrison in order to control the city. Since then the city started to grow and was even allowed to mint its own coins.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

[[File:Leptis Magna Theatre.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Leptis Magna]] in the east of Khums]]

Leptis Magna remained as such until the reign of the Roman emperor [[Tiberius]], when the city and the surrounding area were formally incorporated into the empire as part of the province of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]]. It soon became one of the leading cities of Roman Africa and a major trading post.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Leptis achieved its greatest prominence beginning in 193 CE, when the ethnically [[Punics|Punic]] Lucius [[Septimius Severus]] became [[Roman Emperors|emperor]]. He favored his hometown above all other provincial cities, and the buildings and wealth he lavished on it made Leptis Magna the third-most important city in Africa, rivaling Carthage and [[Alexandria]]. In 205 CE, he and the imperial family visited the city and received great honors.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

[[Image:Leptis Magna B2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Severan Basilica]]

Among the changes that Severus introduced were to create a magnificent new forum and to rebuild the docks.  The natural harbour had a tendency to silt up, but the Severan changes made this worse, and the eastern wharves are extremely well preserved, since they were scarcely used.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Leptis over-extended itself at this period.  During the [[Crisis of the Third Century|Crisis of the 3rd Century]], when trade declined precipitously, Leptis Magna's importance also fell into a decline, and by the middle of the 4th century, even before it was completely devastated by the [[365 Crete earthquake|365 tsunami]], large parts of the city had been abandoned. [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] recounts that the crisis was worsened by a corrupt Roman governor named Romanus during a major tribal raid who demanded bribes to protect the city.  The ruined city could not pay these and complained to the emperor Valentinian. Romanus then bribed people at court and arranged for the Leptan envoys to be punished "for bringing false accusations". It enjoyed a minor renaissance beginning in the reign of the emperor [[Theodosius I]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

In 439 CE, Leptis Magna and the rest of the cities of [[Tripolitania]] fell under the control of the [[Vandals]] when their king, [[Gaiseric]], captured Carthage from the Romans and made it his capital. Unfortunately for the future of Leptis Magna, Gaiseric ordered the city's walls demolished so as to dissuade its people from rebelling against Vandal rule. The people of Leptis and the Vandals both paid a heavy price for this in 523 CE when a group of [[Berber people|Berber]] raiders sacked the city.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

[[Belisarius]] recaptured Leptis Magna in the name of Rome ten years later, and in 534 CE, he [[Vandalic War|destroyed]] the kingdom of the Vandals. Leptis became a provincial capital of the Eastern Roman Empire (see [[Byzantine Empire]]) but never recovered from the destruction wreaked upon it by the Berbers. It was the site of a massacre of Berber chiefs of the [[Leuathae]] tribal confederation by the Roman authorities in 543 CE.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Leptis Magna}}</ref> Historian [[Theodore Mommsen]] wrote that under Byzantine rule the city was fully Christian.<ref>Theodore Mommsen. "The Provinces of the Roman Empire". section:Africa</ref> During the decade 565-578 CE Christian missionaries from Leptis Magna even began to move once more among the [[Berbers|Amazigh]] tribes as far south as the [[Fezzan]] in the Libyan desert and converted the [[Garamantes]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://rhr.revues.org/5401|title=Les derni√®res communaut√©s chr√©tiennes autochtones d'Afrique du Nord|first=Virginie|last=Prevost|journal=Revue de l'Histoire des Religions |date=1 December 2007|issue=4|pages=461‚Äì483|via=rhr.revues.org|doi=10.4000/rhr.5401|doi-access=free}}</ref> But the city's decline - linked even to the Sahara's [[desertification]] - continued, even though new churches were built,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.livius.org/le-lh/lepcis_magna/byzantine_church.html|title=Byzantine Church|first=Jona|last=Lendering|access-date=2020-03-26|archive-date=2016-03-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221421/http://www.livius.org/le-lh/lepcis_magna/byzantine_church.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> and by the time of the Arab conquest of Tripolitania in the 650s, the city was nearly abandoned except for a Byzantine garrison force.

The progressive growth of arid land around Leptis reduced its importance and the port was blocked by the accumulation of sand. As a consequence, when Arabs arrived around 640 CE and later conquered Leptis, they found only a little garrison and a small city of less than 1,000 inhabitants. Due to further decline, Leptis disappeared: by the 10th century the city was forgotten and fully covered by sand.<ref>Silvia Bullo. "Provincia Africa: Leptis Magna". pg 185-188</ref>

===Islamic rule===

Leptis Magna and [[Tripolitania]] were conquered by [['Amr ibn al-'As|Amr ibn al-Aas]] and soon after that, a lot of Arabs settled in the city near the ruins of Leptis Magna while most of the native [[Berbers|Berber]] tribes living there converted to [[Islam]].<ref>History of Arabic Conquest in Libya by Al Zawwy (ÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ÿßŸÑŸÅÿ™ÿ≠ ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿä ŸÅŸä ŸÑŸäÿ®Ÿäÿß ŸÑŸÑÿ≤ÿßŸàŸä)</ref>

For the next few centuries the control of the city shifted between [[Rashidun Caliphate]], [[Umayyad Caliphate]], [[Abbasid Caliphate]], [[Fatimid Caliphate]], [[Zirid dynasty|Zirids]], [[Kingdom of Africa]], [[Almohad Caliphate]] and [[Hafsid dynasty|Hafsids]] before felling under the control of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in the 1550s.

The city became the capital of The Fifth [[Sanjak]] (which included the cities of [[Misurata]], [[Sirte]], [[Zliten]], [[Bani Walid]] and [[Msalata]]), an administrative division of [[Ottoman Tripolitania]] until [[World War I]] and the [[defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]].

===Italian Libya===

[[File:MurqubMonument.jpg|thumbnail|right|"Murqub Martyrs Monument" in Khums]]

The Italians colonized Libya in 1911, and on 10 October of the same year a major battle between natives and Italian Army occurred in [[Murqub Castle]] in Khums and another on in the same place on 27 February 1912. Both battles named [[Battle of Murqub]] are considered as two of the most important battles during the Italian colonizing of Libya. [[Muammar Gaddafi]] later claimed that his grandfather died in this battle.<ref>History of Libyan Jihad Book (ŸÉÿ™ÿßÿ® ÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸáÿßÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸäÿ®Ÿä)</ref> Libya remained under Italian rule until [[World War II]].

During World War II Khums was occupied by [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]] and from 1942 until 1951, when Libya gained independence, Tripolitania and the region of Cyrenaica were administered by the British Military Administration. Italy formally renounced its claim upon the territory in 1947.

===Libyan Independence and Gaddafi regime===

[[Bashir Saadawi]], born in Khums, was one of the major figures who contributed to Libyan independence. He was the founder of the [[National Congress Party (Libya)|National Congress Party]] which supported a [[Republic]] instead of a [[Monarchy]]. When [[King Idris I]] was crowned as King of Libya, all political parties were disbanded and Saadawi was exiled to [[Beirut]] where he remained until his death on 17 January 1957.
[[File:Emir Idris & Bashir Saadwi.jpg|thumbnail|right|Bashir Saadawi (second right) along with [[King Idris I|King Idris]] (Far Right).]]

Khums remained part of Tripolitania province until 1962 when the [[Federal system]] canceled and replaced by [[Governorates of Libya|''Muhafazah'' governorates system]]  (''[[muhafazah]]'') system, and this system remained even after the [[1969 Libyan coup d'√©tat|1969 coup d'√©tat]] and through the [[Libyan Arab Republic]], until superseded by the 1983 [[Districts of Libya|''Baladiyat'' districts system]]. The baladiyat system was itself dropped in 1995 and replaced by thirteen districts named shabiyat. Despite the changes, Khums remained as a separate district under the name of al-Khums or Murqub.

===Libyan Civil War===
{{See also|Libyan Civil War 2011}}
Khums remained under control of Gaddafi forces through most of the war until rebels from [[Misrata]] entered and captured the city on 23 August before moving on to Tripoli.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eastern rebels press onwards to Tripoli|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/video/africa/2011/08/20118233515276905.html|publisher=Al Jazeera English|access-date=14 March 2012}}</ref>

== Climate==

Al-Khums has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[K√∂ppen climate classification]] ''BWh'').

== Al-Khums municipality ==

Al-Khums municipality was once part of [[Murqub District]] and its capital, since 2013 the [[Districts of Libya#22 districts (2007)|22 Shabiya]] divided into [[Municipalities of Libya|90 Municipalities]]; and so al-Khums was separated from [[Zliten]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccmce.ly/decisions-laws.html|title=Decisions and Laws 12 July 2013 (arabic)|access-date=2015-12-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304114826/http://www.ccmce.ly/decisions-laws.html|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>

{{As of|2019}}, al-Khums Municipality consists of some small towns on the outskirts of al-Khums Centre, including Lebda, Al-jahawat, Seleen, El-Sahel and Suuq El-Khamis.
