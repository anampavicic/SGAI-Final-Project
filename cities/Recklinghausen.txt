'''Recklinghausen''' ({{IPA|de|ˌʁɛklɪŋˈhaʊzn̩|-|De-Recklinghausen.ogg}}; [[Westphalian language|Westphalian]]: ''Riäkelhusen'') is the northernmost city in the Ruhr-Area and the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the [[Recklinghausen (district)|Recklinghausen district]]. It borders the rural Münsterland and is characterized by large fields and farms in the north and industry in the south. Recklinghausen is the 60th-largest city in Germany and the 22nd-largest city in North Rhine-Westphalia.

==History==
First mentioned in 1017 as ''Ricoldinchuson'', in 1150 the city was the center of the surrounding [[Vest Recklinghausen]]. In 1236, Recklinghausen received [[town privileges]]. There is record of [[Jews]] in the city as early as 1305.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Recklinghausen |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/recklinghausen |website=Beit Hatfutsot Open Databases Project |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}</ref> As part of the [[County of Vest]], ownership of Recklinghausen changed several times in the 15th and 16th century, and in 1576, the entire county was pawned to the [[Electorate of Cologne|Elector of Cologne]]. In 1582–83, again in 1586, and again in 1587, the city was plundered by partisan armies during the [[Cologne War]], a feud over religious parity in [[Electorate of Cologne]] and electoral influence in the Holy Roman Empire.

Recklinghausen was also the site of more than 100 [[Witch-hunt|witchcraft trials]] (1514–1710).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The trial activity reached a climax twice: In the time period of 1580/81 and again in 1588/89. The last person to be convicted of [[witchcraft]] was Anna Spickermann; after spending 16&nbsp;months in prison, she was sentenced to death by sword and burned afterward.

{{circa|1600}}, the administration of the Vest Recklinghausen was divided into two parts, with the eastern part administered by Recklinghausen. The town of Recklinghausen including the parish of Recklinghausen and the parishes [[Ahsen]], [[Datteln]], [[Flaesheim]], [[Hamm-Bossendorf]], [[Henrichenburg]], [[Herten]], Horneburg, [[Oer-Erkenschwick|Oer]], [[Suderwich]], [[Waltrop]] and [[Westerholt]]. In 1803-1811 became the capital of a sovereign Principality of the Dukes of Arenberg who retain the title. {{circa|1815}}, the Vest was made a [[Bürgermeisterei]], with the town becoming the seat. In 1819, [[Herten]] joined the Recklinghausen Bürgermeisterei, and [[Oer-Erkenschwick|Erkenschwick]] followed in 1821.

During [[World War II]], in December 1939, the [[Stalag XX-B]] [[German prisoner-of-war camps in World War II|prisoner-of-war camp]] was founded in the city, however, it was relocated after a few days,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Daniluk|first=Jan|year=2012|title=Wykorzystanie siły roboczej jeńców wojennych w XX Okręgu Wojskowym w latach II wojny światowej (zarys problemu)|journal=Łambinowicki rocznik muzealny|location=Opole|language=pl|volume=35|page=21}}</ref> and from 1941 to 1943, a [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]] camp was operated in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.2&tab=7&id=100000653|title=Arbeitserziehungslager Recklinghausen|website=Bundesarchiv.de|access-date=12 March 2023|language=de}}</ref> As a target of the [[Oil Campaign of World War II]], oil production at Recklinghausen/Forstezung was bombed by the RAF on 15 January 1945; and South Recklinghausen (''Recklinghausen Süd'') was captured by the US [[35th Infantry Division (United States)|137th Infantry]] on 1 April 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.35thinfdivassoc.com/CentralEurope/Europe-Page-3.shtml|title=The Central Europe Campaign, Page 3 - The 35th Infantry Division in World War Two|website=www.35thinfdivassoc.com|access-date=28 December 2017}}</ref>
