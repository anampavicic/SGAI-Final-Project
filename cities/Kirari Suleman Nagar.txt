== History ==

Kirari first officially appeared as (khiraree) on the map found in the musty room of the National Archives of India which shows Delhi in 1807, shortly after the arrival of the British in 1803. It highlights the hierarchy of settlements, from small to larger villages.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Six Delhi maps chart the city's evolution from 1807 to 2021|url=https://scroll.in/magazine/841320/six-delhi-maps-chart-the-citys-evolution-from-1807-to-2021|last=Chaudhuri|first=Zinnia Ray|website=Scroll.in|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-16}}</ref>

On 15 August 1947, when India became independent, the Government of India formed the 'Matsya Union' by combining Alwar, Bharatpur, Dholpur and Karauli from the princely states of Rajputana and 'Rajasthan' by merging the remaining princely states. In June 1949, the four princely states of Matsya Union were also merged in Rajasthan. On behalf of the state of Bharatpur, the Matsyavajas Jat Dheeraj Mathur and Natha Mathur were appointed to conduct the court by making the ruler of five villages named Karala, Pansali, Punth Khurd, Kiradi, Hastasar near Delhi. The ruins of this office are still lying in Karaala. Settled in Kakana village (near Gohana) from this village itself.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}
