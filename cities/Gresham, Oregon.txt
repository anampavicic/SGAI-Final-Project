'''Gresham''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|r|ɛ|ʃ|əm}} {{respell|GRESH|əm}}) is a city in the [[Willamette Valley]], Located in [[Multnomah County, Oregon|Multnomah County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]], bordered by [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] to the northwest and partially in the southwest. it was first settled in the early 1850s by the Powell brothers. It remained unincorporated until 1905; it was named after [[Walter Quintin Gresham]], an [[American Civil War]] general and [[United States Secretary of State]].

The early economy of the city was primarily supported by agriculture, and by the mid-20th century, the city saw a population boom, increasing from 4,000 residents to more than 10,000 between 1960 and 1970. The population was 114,247 at the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]],<ref name="2020 Census (City)">{{cite web|title=Explore Census Data |url=https://data.census.gov/profile/Gresham_city,_Oregon?g=160XX00US4131250 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=December 31, 2023}}</ref> making it the second most populous city in the county and the [[List of cities in Oregon|fourth-most populous city]] in [[Oregon]]. Gresham is an economic center for eastern Multnomah County.

==History==
[[File:Gresham 1918.png|thumb|left|Downtown Gresham in 1918]]
The area now known as Gresham was first settled in 1851 by brothers Jackson and James Powell, who laid claim to land under the [[Donation Land Claim Act]] of 1850 and named the settlement Powell's Valley.<ref name="history">{{cite web |title=Gresham |url=http://www.pdxhistory.com/html/gresham.html |access-date=April 18, 2016 |work=PDX History}}</ref>  In 1884, a local merchant petitioned for a post office from the [[United States Post Office Department]] to be established in his store, proposing to name it after Postmaster General Walter Q. Gresham if his request was granted. Concurrently, other community members secured a post office named "Campground," which referred to the area's religious camp meeting site and its convenience as a stop for travelers heading to Portland. Once the Post Office Department recognized its error, it revoked the Campground post office designation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gresham|url=http://www.ohwy.com/or/g/gresham.htm|website=Online Highways Home|access-date=November 5, 2015}}</ref><ref>Chilton, W.R. (1993). ''Gresham: Stories of Our Past: Campground to City.''</ref>

Gresham was incorporated in 1905, the year of the [[Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition]]; its population at the time was 365. Lewis Shattuck, a member of a pioneer family, served as the first [[mayor]].{{Sfn|Hoff|1910|p=156}} The local economy was primarily driven by agriculture, particularly the cultivation of berries, grapes, and vegetables. During that period, trains operated between Gresham and Portland on an hourly schedule. Gresham's early settlers would go on to form the outlying communities of [[Boring, Oregon|Boring]], [[Sandy, Oregon|Sandy]], [[Fairview, Oregon|Fairview]], and [[Estacada, Oregon|Estacada]].<ref name="history"/>

Gresham's city library, which began as a small book collection in the town's general store, was officially established as the [[Gresham Carnegie Library|Gresham Branch Public Library]] in 1913 with a grant from the [[Carnegie library|Andrew Carnegie library fund]].<ref name=outlook>{{cite news|last=Endicott|first=Anne|title=Telling the story of where we call home|url=http://portlandtribune.com/go/42-news/111861-telling-the-story-of-where-we-call-home|access-date=December 3, 2012|newspaper=Gresham Outlook|date=July 6, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/gresham/index.ssf/2012/04/gresham_focus_tour_of_building.html|work=Oregon Live|title=Gresham Focus: Tour of buildings becomes a living history lesson|author=Hottle, Molly|date=April 12, 2012|access-date=April 18, 2016}}</ref>
