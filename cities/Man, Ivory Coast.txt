The area is the largest producer of coffee in the Ivory Coast. It is the home of a UNICAFÉ (The National Coffee Manufacturer of Côte d'Ivoire) factory, and [[Nestlé]] operates several coffee plants in the area.<ref name="Hamilton2004">{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Janice|title=Ivory Coast in Pictures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aj5grzlSjFAC&pg=PA60|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|isbn=978-0-8225-1992-8|page=60}}</ref> The central [[market (place)|market]] of Man buys and sells a large variety of [[fabrics]] (Yacouba [[traditional clothes]], so-called Boubou Yacouba), and an endless collection of Dan (Yacouba) [[masks]].

The city is the home of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Man]], with its cathedral at the Cathédrale Saint-Michel.

The main attractions around Man are La Cascade waterfall, a large rocky outcrop which overlooks the town known as the La Dent de Man (the tooth of Man), and the monkey forest.<ref name="AuziasFuté,2013">{{cite book|last1=Auzias|first1=Dominique |last2=Labourdette |first2=Jean-Paul |title=Côte d'Ivoire 2013-2014 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sJDXQ65aO4AC&pg=PA296 |date=6 February 2013|publisher=Petit Futé|language=French|isbn=2-7469-6176-8|page=296}}</ref> La Cascade waterfall is situated at the west side of the town, and is surrounded by a bamboo forest, which is the habitat of many colorful [[dragonflies]] and a wide variety of [[butterflies]]. The monkey forest is a wooded area in which monkeys live; for a small fee tourists can persuade local residents to call the monkeys out of their forest habitat.
