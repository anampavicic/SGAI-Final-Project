Following its rise to prominence in the [[Age of Enlightenment]], it was nicknamed the "capital of Eastern France" in the late 19th century.

==History==
{{For timeline|Timeline of Nancy}}

The earliest signs of human settlement in the area date to 800 BC. Early settlers were likely attracted by easily mined iron ore and a ford in the river [[Meurthe (river)|Meurthe]]. Its name is first attested as ''Nanciaco'', possibly from a Gaulish personal name. A small fortified town named Nanciacum (''Nancy'') was built by [[Gérard, Duke of Lorraine]] around 1050.

Nancy was burned in 1218 at the end of the [[War of Succession of Champagne]], and conquered by Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]. It was rebuilt in stone over the next few centuries as it grew in importance as the capital of the [[Duchy of Lorraine]]. Duke [[Charles I, Duke of Burgundy|Charles the Bold]] of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], was defeated and killed in the [[Battle of Nancy]] in 1477; [[René II, Duke of Lorraine]] became the ruler.

Following the failure of both [[Emperor Joseph I]] and [[Emperor Charles VI]] to produce a son and heir, the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]] left the throne to the latter's next child. This turned out to be a daughter, [[Maria Theresa of Austria]]. In 1736, Emperor Charles arranged her marriage to Duke [[Francis of Lorraine|François]] of Lorraine, who reluctantly agreed to exchange his ancestral lands for the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]].

The exiled Polish king Stanislaus I (''Stanisław Leszczyński'' in Polish), father-in-law of the French king [[Louis XV]], was then given the vacant duchy of Lorraine. Under his nominal rule, Nancy experienced growth and a flowering of Baroque culture and architecture. Stanislaus oversaw the construction of Place Stanislaus, a major square and development connecting the old medieval with a newer part of the city. On the south side of the Place Stanislaus is the [[Hôtel de Ville, Nancy|Hôtel de Ville]], which was completed in 1755.<ref>{{Base Mérimée|PA00106124}}</ref> Upon Stanislaus' death in February 1766, [[Lorraine and Barrois]] became a regular government of the [[Kingdom of France]].<ref name="The Encyclopædia Britannica">{{cite EB1911|wstitle= Lorraine |volume= 17 | pages = 9–12; see page 12 ;lines 3 and 4:= " At his death in February 1766 the two duchies of Lorraine and Bar became definitively incorporated in the kingdom of France." |last1= Poupardin |first1= René |author-link= René Poupardin}}</ref> A ''[[parlement]]'' for Lorraine and Barrois was established in Nancy in 1776.<ref name="The Encyclopædia Britannica"/>

As unrest surfaced within the French Armed Forces during the [[French Revolution]], a full-scale mutiny, known as the [[Nancy affair]], took place in Nancy in the latter part of summer 1790. A few units loyal to the government laid siege to the town and shot or imprisoned the mutineers.

In 1871, Nancy remained French when Germany annexed [[Alsace-Lorraine]]. In 1909 it hosted the [[Exposition Internationale de l'Est de la France]] between May and November.

Nancy was occupied by German forces beginning in 1940 and renamed Nanzig. During the [[Lorraine Campaign]] of World War II, Nancy was liberated from [[Nazi Germany]] by the [[United States Army Central|US Third Army]] in September 1944, at the [[Battle of Nancy (1944)|Battle of Nancy]].

In 1988, Pope [[John Paul II]] visited Nancy. In 2005, French President [[Jacques Chirac]], German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] and Polish President [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]] inaugurated the renovated Place Stanislas, which was recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.

==Geography==
Nancy is situated on the left bank of the river [[Meurthe (river)|Meurthe]], about 10&nbsp;km upstream from its confluence with the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]]. The [[Marne–Rhine Canal]] runs through the city, parallel to the Meurthe. Nancy is surrounded by hills that are about 150 m higher than the city center, which is situated at 200 m above mean sea level. The area of Nancy proper is relatively small: 15&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Its built-up area is continuous with those of its adjacent suburbs. The neighboring communes of Nancy are: [[Jarville-la-Malgrange]], [[Laxou]], [[Malzéville]], [[Maxéville]], [[Saint-Max]], [[Tomblaine]], [[Vandœuvre-lès-Nancy]] and [[Villers-lès-Nancy]].

The oldest part of Nancy is the quarter ''[[Ville Vieille - Léopold|Vieille Ville – Léopold]]'', which contains the 14th century ''Porte de la Craffe'', the [[Palace of the Dukes of Lorraine]], the [[Porte Désilles]] and the 19th century [[Saint Epvre Basilica|St-Epvre basilica]]. Adjacent to its south is the quarter ''Charles III – Centre Ville'', which is the 16th–18th century "new town". This quarter contains the famous [[Place Stanislas]], the [[Nancy Cathedral]], the [[Opéra national de Lorraine]] and the [[Gare de Nancy-Ville|main railway station]].

The population of the city proper experienced a small decrease in population since 2007, placing it behind Metz as the second largest city in the Lorraine.<ref name="compar">{{cite web|url=https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/1405599?geo=COM-54395+COM-57463|title=Comparateur de territoire, Commune de Nancy (54395), Commune de Metz (57463)|publisher=INSEE|access-date=13 April 2022}}</ref> However, the urban area of Metz experienced population decline from 1990 to 2010 while the urban area of Nancy grew over the same period, becoming the largest urban area in Lorraine and second largest in the "[[Grand Est]]" region of northeastern France. Within the Nancy metropolitan area in recent years, the city population declined slightly (2009–2014) at the roughly same time as a small increase in the population of its urban area (2006–2012).

===Climate===
Nancy has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''), although a bit more extreme than most of the larger [[List of communes in France with over 20,000 inhabitants|French cities]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=8170&cityname=Nancy,+Lorraine,+France&units=|title=Nancy, France Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=28 March 2019}}</ref> By the standards of France it is a "continental" climate with a certain degree of maritime (unrelated to the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen classification]], since generally the whole country has a predominant mechanism favored by the [[West wind]]s).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://houot.alain.pagesperso-orange.fr/Geo/France/fr_gen/2_nat/fr_nature_2.html|title=France Climats|website=houot.alain.pagesperso-orange.fr|access-date=28 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/France|title=France – Climate|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=28 March 2019}}</ref>

The temperatures have a distinct variation of the [[Temperate climate|temperate zone]], both during the day and between seasons but without being very different. Winters are cold and dry in freezing climates. Summers are not always sunny, but warm enough. Mists are frequent in autumn and the winds are light and not too violent. Precipitation tends to be less abundant than in the west of the country. Sunshine hours are almost identical to Paris and the snowy days are the same as [[Strasbourg]] (most similar weather conditions).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.linternaute.com/ville/nancy/ville-54395/climat|title=Climat et météo de Nancy (54000)|website=linternaute.com|access-date=28 March 2019}}</ref> Although the lowest recorded temperature is officially −26.8&nbsp;°C, some sources consider temperatures from −30&nbsp;°C on 10 December 1879 before continuous data.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prevision-meteo.ch/almanach/1879|title=Année 1879, almanach météo complet des ères géologiques à nos jours|website=prevision-meteo.ch|access-date=29 March 2019|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160821153054/http://www.prevision-meteo.ch/almanach/1879|archive-date=21 August 2016}}</ref>

==Main sights==
[[File:Nancy - palais ducal, façade.jpg|thumb|The [[Ducal Palace of Nancy]]]]

The old city center's heritage dates from the Middle Ages to the 18th century. The [[Nancy Cathedral|cathedral of Nancy]], the Triumphal Arch and the "Place de la Carrière" are a fine examples of 18th-century architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nancy-tourisme.fr/nancy-tourism/discover/history-and-heritage/|title=History and heritage – Nancy Tourisme|website=nancy-tourisme.fr|access-date=29 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521214540/http://www.nancy-tourisme.fr/nancy-tourism/discover/history-and-heritage/|archive-date=21 May 2013}}</ref> The [[Palace of the Dukes of Lorraine]] is the former princely residence of the rulers. The palace houses the [[Musée Lorrain]].

A historic church is the [[Church of Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours, Nancy]], final resting place of the last duke Stanislas. Other notable churches are the [[Church of Saint-François-des-Cordeliers]] and the [[Saint Epvre Basilica|Basilica of Saint-Epvre]], which have historical ties to the ducal [[House of Lorraine]].[[File:Nancy Cathedral BW 2015-07-18 16-22-28.jpg|thumb|Notre-Dame [[Cathedral of Nancy]]|left]]The [[Place Stanislas]]<ref>[http://www.laplusbelleplacedumonde.com/flash/sommaire.html Images of the Place Stanislas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526214339/http://www.laplusbelleplacedumonde.com/flash/sommaire.html |date=26 May 2007 }}</ref> named after king of [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]], [[Lithuania|Grand Duke of Lithuania]] and duke of Lorraine [[Stanislaus I]], Place de la Carrière, and Place d'Alliance were added on the [[World Heritage Sites]] list by the [[UNESCO]] in 1983.

The "[[École de Nancy]]", a group of artists and architects founded by the glassmaster and furniture maker [[Émile Gallé]], worked in the [[Art Nouveau]] style at the end of the 19th century and the early 20th century. It was principally their work which made Nancy a center of art and architecture that rivaled Paris and helped give the city the nickname "Capitale de l'Est". The city still possesses many Art Nouveau buildings (mostly banks or private homes). Furniture, [[glassware]], and other pieces of the decorative arts are conserved at the [[Musée de l'École de Nancy]], which is housed in the 1909 villa of [[Eugène Corbin]], a Nancy businessman and supporter of the Art Nouveau there. The Musée des Beaux-Arts has further collections of the Art Nouveau movement.

A major [[botanical garden]], the ''[[Jardin botanique du Montet]]'', is located at Villers-lès-Nancy. Other gardens of interest include the city's earliest botanical garden, the ''[[Jardin Dominique Alexandre Godron]]'', and various other public gardens and places of interest including the Pépinière and Parc Sainte-Marie (public gardens). The town also has an aquarium. The surroundings of the train station are a busy commercial area.

==Transport==
The main railway station is [[Gare de Nancy-Ville]], with direct connections to Paris (high-speed rail line), [[Metz]], [[Lyon]], [[Strasbourg]] and several regional destinations. The motorway [[A31 autoroute|A31]] connects Nancy with Metz, [[Luxembourg]] and [[Langres]].

A nearby regional airport [[Metz–Nancy–Lorraine_Airport|Lorraine Airfield]] provides scheduled air service to several cities within France. 

Public transport within Nancy is provided by ''Service de Transport de l'Agglomération Nancéienne'' (STAN),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reseau-stan.com/|title=Stan: Page d'accueil|website=reseau-stan.com|access-date=29 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110224054549/http://www.reseau-stan.com|archive-date=24 February 2011}}</ref> operated by [[Veolia Transport]], operating around 20 conventional bus routes and, until early 2023, the [[Nancy Guided Light Transit|''Tram'' by STAN]], a [[guided bus]]way based on [[Bombardier Transportation]]'s [[Bombardier Guided Light Transit|Guided Light Transit]] (GLT) technology and using [[Articulated bus|articulated]] [[trolleybus]]es that was running for approximately 10 km on the East-West axis.

==Heraldry==
[[File:Grandes Armes de Nancy.svg|thumb|The greater coat of arms]]

The coat of arms of Nancy displays a [[thistle]], originally considered to be a symbol of [[Virgin Mary]], and adopted as a personal symbol by [[René of Anjou]] and later by his descendant [[René II, Duke of Lorraine]]. Contrary to the Scottish thistle, the one of Lorraine is always shown with its roots. During the wars against [[Burgundy]], the thistle became an emblem for the people of Lorraine as a whole. It officially became the attribute of the city of Nancy in 1575 when [[Charles III, Duke of Lorraine]] granted the city with its own coat of arms.<ref name="heraldry">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nancy-webtv.fr/index.php/sommaire/622-origine-du-blason-de-nancy|title=Origine du blason de Nancy|publisher=Nancy WebTV|access-date=11 February 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211155521/http://www.nancy-webtv.fr/index.php/sommaire/622-origine-du-blason-de-nancy|archive-date=11 February 2017}}</ref>

At first, the coat of arms of Nancy had a [[chief (heraldry)|chief]] of Lorraine, which meant that the upper part showed the ducal arms, namely three [[alerion]]s on a red bend. Later, the chief of Lorraine was replaced by a more complex one which gathers the former possessions of the Dukes of Lorraine. The upper row comprises from left to right the arms of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], while the lower row comprises the [[Duchy of Anjou]], the [[Guelders|Duchy of Guelders]], the [[Duchy of Jülich]] and the [[County of Bar]]. The inescutcheon is the coat of arms of Lorraine itself.<ref name="heraldry"/>

The coat of arms displays the motto, which appeared in the end of the 16th century. It was initially "''Nul ne s'y frotte''" ("no one attacks it"), but it was changed to Latin "''Non inultus premor''" in 1616. The motto has a similar meaning to the Scottish one, "''[[Nemo me impune lacessit]]''", usually translated as "No one attacks me with impunity", which also makes reference to the [[thistle]]. The coat of arms further displays the [[Legion of Honour]], awarded to the city after the [[First World War]], and the [[Croix de Guerre|War Crosses]] 14–18 and 39–45.<ref name="heraldry"/>
