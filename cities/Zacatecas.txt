'''Zacatecas''' ({{IPA|es|sakaˈtekas|lang|ES-pe_-_Zacatecas.ogg}}), officially the '''Free and Sovereign State of Zacatecas''' ({{langx|es|Estado Libre y Soberano de Zacatecas}}), is one of the [[Political divisions of Mexico|31 states]] of [[Mexico]]. It is divided into [[Municipalities of Zacatecas|58 municipalities]] and its capital city is [[Zacatecas City|Zacatecas]].

It is located in north-central Mexico and is bordered by the states of [[Durango]] to the northwest, [[Coahuila]] to the north, [[Nayarit]] to the west, [[San Luis Potosí]] and [[Nuevo León]] to the east, and [[Jalisco]], [[Guanajuato]] and [[Aguascalientes]] to the south. The state is best known for its rich deposits of [[silver]] and other [[mineral]]s, its [[Spanish Colonial architecture|colonial architecture]] and its importance during the [[Mexican Revolution]]. Its main economic activities are [[mining]], [[agriculture]] and [[tourism]].

==Geography==
Zacatecas is located in the center-north of Mexico, and covers an area of 75,284 km<sup>2</sup>, the tenth-largest state in the country.<ref name=resumen>{{cite web |title= Resumen |publisher= INEGI |language=es   |url=    http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/zac/default.aspx?tema=me&e=32 |access-date=November 18, 2013 }}</ref><ref name=territorio>{{cite web |title= Territorio |publisher= INEGI |language=es   |url=    http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/zac/territorio/default.aspx?tema=me&e=32 |access-date=November 18, 2013 }}</ref><ref name=aspectos>{{cite web |title=Zacatecas, estado de clima generoso |publisher=Government of Zacatecas |language=es |url=http://www.zacatecas.gob.mx/index.php/zacatecas/aspectos-generales/ |access-date=November 18, 2013 |archive-date=August 28, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828153835/http://www.zacatecas.gob.mx/index.php/zacatecas/aspectos-generales/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> It borders the states of [[Nayarit]], [[Jalisco]], [[Aguascalientes]], [[San Luis Potosí]], [[Coahuila]] and [[Durango]] and is divided into 58 municipalities and 4,882 towns, cities and other communities.<ref name=aspectos/><ref name=encmuc>{{cite web |title=Zacatecas |work=Enciclopedia de Los Municipios y Delegaciones de México Estado de Zacatecas. |publisher=Instituto para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |year=2010 |language=es |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb/ELOCAL/EMM_Zacatecas |access-date=November 18, 2013 |archive-date=November 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122190611/http://e-local.gob.mx/wb/ELOCAL/EMM_Zacatecas |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The state has an average altitude of 2230 meters above sea level, with the capital at 2,496 masl.<ref name=aspectos/> The state has three main geographical regions, the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] in the west, the [[Mexican Plateau]] and the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]]. Most of it is in the Sierra Madre Occidental with highly rugged peaks of over 2,500 meters above sea level. The mountains of the southeast and northeast are lower but there are large valleys such as the Juchipila and Tlaltenango. Most of the territory has only small mesas and other areas of flat land. In the center of the state there is a small mountain chain called the Sierra de Fresnillo, from which much of the state's mineral wealth comes. In the extreme northwest there is another important mountain chain called the Sierra de Sombrerete, marked by a mountain called Sombreretillo, which is an important source of mineral wealth. Near this chain is another called the Sierra de Órganos.<ref name=encmuc/>

[[File:Arroyo en Sierra de Cardos.jpg|thumb|left|Stream in the [[Sierra de Cardos]], part of the Sierra Madre Occidental.]]

No major rivers run through the state and most of the waterways run only during the rainy season. The state is part of two water basins. The southeast of the state belongs to the [[Lerma River]] basin, which eventually empties in the Pacific Ocean. Rivers belonging to this basin include the San Pedro, Juchipila, Jerez and Tlaltenango. The other basin is smaller and [[endorheic]], and does not empty into any ocean. The state has eighty dams with a total capacity of 595,337 million cubic meters. The largest of these are the Leobardo Reynoso in [[Fresnillo]], Miguel Aleman in Tepechitlan and El Chique in [[Tabasco, Zacatecas|Tabasco]]. Much of the state's water is underground divided into twenty hydraulic zones. These are accessed by over 5,800 wells, mostly for agricultural use.<ref name=encmuc/>

Most of the territory has a cool, dry climate, although areas in the south have more moisture, with most rain falling between June and September. The driest and coldest areas are in the northeast, known as the Salado because of its saltwater lakes.<ref name=aspectos/><ref name=encmuc/> 75% of the state is arid or semi-arid. 14% is arable and 79% is suitable for the grazing of livestock.<ref name=encmuc/>

The average annual temperature is 16C with most of the state being temperate. The coldest months are from November to January, with frost not uncommon. The warmest month is June. The state gets an average rainfall of 400mm per year mostly in the summer, with the warmest and wettest part of the state is along the Sierra Madre Occidental.<ref name=aspectos/><ref name=encmuc/>

Ecosystems vary depending on relief, soil and temperature, leading to a wide variety of vegetation, including forests, scrub and grasslands. Arid areas are dominated by various species of cactus. In the far south there are deciduous trees that lose their leaves in winter and spring. Statewide the most common trees are mesquite, ironwood and palo verde ([[Parkinsonia]]). In the highest altitude, near the Jalisco border, there are mixed forests of pine and [[Quercus rotundifolia|holm oak]], with the latter dominating along the border with Durango and some along the border with San Luis Potosí.<ref name=encmuc/> One interesting tree that occurs in Zacatecas is the elephant tree (''[[Bursera microphylla]]'').<ref>C. Michael Hogan (2009) [http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=90792 ''Elephant Tree: Bursera microphylla'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N.

In the sierras there are many [[wild boar]], [[white-tailed deer]] and [[hares]]; in the valleys and plains it is common to find [[coyote]], [[badgers]], [[quails]] and [[ducks]]. The extreme northern part of the state is the southern fringe of the [[Chihuahuan Desert]] and as such is rich and diverse in biology. This desert is home to a large amount of cacti and is one of the most ecologically diverse deserts on earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Chihuahuan_desert|title=Search - The Encyclopedia of Earth|website=Eoearth.org|access-date=31 May 2018}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:SierradeO_05.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Sierra de Órganos National Park|Sierra of Organos National Park]]]]
The state name derives from the name of its capital, Zacatecas. This word is derived from Nahuatl and means "where there is abundant zacate (grass)".<ref name=encmuc/><ref name=pasado>{{cite web |title= Nuestro Pasado |publisher=Government of Zacatecas |language=es |url= http://www.zacatecas.gob.mx/index.php/zacatecas/nuestro-pasado/|access-date=November 18, 2013 }}</ref> The state seal depicts the [[Cerro de la Bufa]], a landmark of the capital, surrounded by the weapons of the original inhabitants. Above is the motto "Work conquers all."<ref name=encmuc/><ref name=hiscom/>

Before the arrival of the Spanish, dominant ethnic groups included the [[Caxcan]]s, [[Zacateco]]s, and [[Guachichil]]s, with a probable rivalry between the Guachichils and the Caxcans. The history of these peoples is unclear and it is not known when the first settlements were founded in the region. Between the fourth and tenth centuries in the Christian era, several large settlements developed such as Altavista, Chalchihuites and La Quemada, considered to be part of Greater [[Mesoamerica]].<ref name=hiscom/><ref name=pasado/> Areas in the north of the state, without major settlements, were part of what is called [[Aridoamerica]], where inhabitants lived off hunting and gathering.<ref name=encmuc/> The first of the major population centers emerged along the Suchil, Graceros and Guadiana Rivers. The archaeological sites of today are all ceremonial centers and/or observatories in the center of metropolises.<ref name=encmuc/>

The first Spanish settlement in the state's current borders was in what is now Nochistlan in 1531, the original [[Guadalajara]]. This settlement was later moved to its current location in Jalisco because of water supply problems and indigenous attacks.<ref name=encmuc/> The capital was founded by [[Juan de Tolosa]] with the support of [[Cristobal de Oñate]] and [[Pedro Almendez Chirinos]] in 1546, after the discovery of one of the world's richest silver veins.<ref name=encmuc/><ref name=hiscom/><ref name="Bakewell">{{cite book|author=West, Robert|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PX7chM2-KpUC|title=Mines of Silver and Gold in the Americas|date=1997|publisher=Variorum|isbn=9780860785132|editor1-last=Bakewell|editor1-first=Peter John|pages=57|chapter=Early Silver Mining in New Spain 1531-1555}}</ref>
However, shortly afterwards most Spanish attention turned back south because of indigenous uprisings. The area remained dangerous for Spanish settlement because of the fierce opposition of the native peoples. In 1541, an indigenous leader named [[Francisco Tenamaztle|Tenamextle, also known as Francisco Tenamaztle and Diego the Aztec]], rebelled, capturing and executing Spanish leader Miguel de Ibarra. The Spanish defeated the Caxcans during the [[Mixtón War]] in the 1540s. Tenamextle escaped the battle and continued to organize rebellions against the Spanish. However, the Spanish continued to push into Zacatecas because of its silver wealth, making it a province of [[New Galicia]]. Although able to establish mining towns, convoys transporting the metal were regularly attacked.<ref name=hiscom/>

Much of the state's colonial history to the present has been related to its mineral production, especially of silver. The first boom was from the Conquest to the mid 17th century.<ref name=hiscom/> The riches drew settlers from the south, and in 1586, Phillip II gave the city the name of Noble and Loyal City of Nuestra Señora de los Zacatecas. In 1588, he authorized its coat of arms. Most of the state was evangelized by the Franciscans, who founded a hospice in the city in 1558 and by 1567 had built a large monastery. They officially took possession of its religious functions in 1603. Later other orders arrived, founding monasteries; but they did not evangelize the indigenous.<ref name=encmuc/>

The next boom was in the early 18th century, with the state producing one-fifth of the world's silver.<ref name=hiscom/> These riches supported the establishment of new settlements along with the building of elegant churches and mansions as the area became one of the most important of [[New Spain]].<ref name=pasado/>

During the [[Mexican War of Independence]], [[Miguel Hidalgo]]'s troops marched through Zacatecas twice, once when they were attacking royalist troops and later when fleeing them. The war ended in 1821 and Zacatecas formally became a state in 1824, with the city of Zacatecas as its capital. Zacatecas continued to grow.<ref name=encmuc/><ref name=hiscom/>

[[File:Fresnillo - agricultura 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Agriculture in [[Fresnillo]], Zacatecas, Mexico]]
The state's history during the rest of the 19th century was tumultuous, as it was in the rest of the country. From Independence until the 1860s, Liberal and Conservative elements occupied the capital at one time or another, until Liberal leader Jesús González Ortega seized control of the state permanently in 1859. This leader's decrees against Conservative sympathizers drove many Catholic priests out of the state. In 1861, French troops occupied Zacatecas but only for two years before being driven out.<ref name=hiscom/> For the rest of the century, the state was mostly controlled by local strongmen, such as González Ortega, Trinidad García de la Cadena and Genero Codina.<ref name=encmuc/> The fighting depressed silver production until near the end of the century, but it recovered enough to account for sixty percent of the state's export revenue.<ref name=hiscom/>

At the end of the century, technological innovations such as the [[telegraph]], telephone, electricity and rail lines connected the state with the rest of Mexico. Trains provided direct links to [[Ciudad Juárez]], [[Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes|Aguascalientes]] and [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], which led to emigration out of the state, primarily to the United States in the 20th century.<ref name=encmuc/><ref name=hiscom/>

Zacatecas was again a battleground with the outbreak of the [[Mexican Revolution]] in the early 20th century. One of the largest and most decisive battles of this conflict took place outside the capital and is called the [[Toma de Zacatecas]] (Taking of Zacatecas). This battle pitted the troops of [[Francisco Villa]] against those of [[Victoriano Huerta]], resulting in the deaths of 7,000 soldiers and the wounding of 5,000. Civilian casualties were not recorded.<ref name=hiscom/><ref name=pasado/> The battle led to the naming of the city as a "Ciudad Heroica" (Heroic City).<ref name=encmuc/>

In 1993, [[UNESCO]] named the historic center of Zacatecas as a [[World Heritage Site]].<ref name=encmuc/>

From 1998 to 2004, the state undertook a major project to expand the highway system.<ref name=encmuc/>

==Culture, festivals, and traditions==
[[File:Troupe Mexique 07854.JPG|thumb|right|Zacatecan ''Danza de [[Matachines]]'' (Dance of the Matachines)]]
Most of the state's festivities are in honor of local patron saints and many of the secular festivals have links to religious ones. Such festivals often focus on recitals of traditional dances such as the Mexicapan. Many of these are derived from waltzes and polkas because of the state's mining history. The Mexican Revolution took a toll on the state's local musical traditions, but one that has survived is the Tamborazo, especially in Jerez.<ref name=encmuc/>

In the state capital, September 8 is dedicated to the Virgen del Patrocinio on the Cerro de la Bufa, with various cultural and artistic events such as bullfighting, concerts, horse racing and culinary demonstrations. The last week of August is dedicated to the Morismas de Bracho, a theatrical production of the struggle between Moors and Christians.<ref name=encmuc/>

It hosts the International Folklore Festival in August, featuring dance and costumes from around the world. It is held during [[Holy Week in Mexico|Holy Week]], and features music, food, street performances, dancing and parties.<ref name=hiscom/>

Condoches are gorditas made with fresh corn cooked in corn husks. Gorditas de cuajada are representative of food on ranches. Meat is most typically prepared as part of a stew to which vegetables such as corn, chickpeas, squash, rice and more are added.

Traditional beverages include [[pulque]], [[aguamiel]], [[aguardiente]] and mezcal as well as a purely local beverage called [[colonche]], made by fermenting a cactus fruit.<ref name=encmuc/>

==Archeological sites==
[[File:La Quemada, Zacatecas.jpg|thumb|View of the Salón de las Columnas in [[La Quemada]].]]

Altavista is located 229&nbsp;km northwest of the city of Zacatecas. It was a ceremonial center, part of the Chalchihuite culture, active between 200 and 1000 AD. It is named after a local ranch, and was explored for the first time at the beginning of the 20th century by Manuel Gamio. Its main building is called the Labyrinth.<ref name=argob>{{cite web |title= Arqueología |publisher= Secretaria de Turismo, Zacatecas |language=es |url= http://zacatecastravel.com/arqueologia.php|access-date=November 18, 2013 }}</ref>

La Quemada is located fifty km south of the city of Zacatecas, the state's largest pre Hispanic settlement.<ref name=encmuc/><ref name=hiscom/> It developed between 500 and 900 AD and covered an area of over 70,000m2 at its height. Its name, which means "the burnt" comes from evidence that the city was burned and abandoned. Who occupied the city is not known, with speculation relating to Teotihuacan, the Purépecha and the Toltecs.<ref name=argob/>

El Teúl is on a large hill overlooking the modern town of [[Teúl de González Ortega (municipality)]]. The name comes from Nahuatl and means "of the gods". It was a ceremonial center, with residences located north of it. The site is noted for its pit burials as well as the oldest copper smelting facility in Mesoamerica {{citation needed|date=December 2016}}. It was inhabited from 200 AD to 1531, when the Spanish destroyed it.<ref name=argob/> It is one of several religious and population centers created by the Caxcans, who were semi nomadic, along with others in Tlaltenango, Juchipila and Teocaltiche.<ref name=hiscom/>
