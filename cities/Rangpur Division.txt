'''Rangpur Division''' ({{langx|bn|রংপুর বিভাগ}}) is one of the Divisions in Bangladesh. It was formed on 25 January 2010,<ref name=Banglapedia>{{cite book 
|author=Rajib Mondal
|chapter=Rangpur Division 
|chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Rangpur_Division
|title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |editor=Sirajul Islam and Ahmed A. Jamal |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]] |year=2012 |edition=Second}}</ref> as [[Bangladesh]]'s 7th division. Before that, it was under  [[Rajshahi Division]]. The Rangpur division consists of eight districts. There are 58 Upazilas or subdistricts under these eight districts. Rangpur is the northernmost division of Bangladesh and has a population of 17,610,956 in the 2022 Census.

The major cities of [[Rangpur Division]] are [[Rangpur, Bangladesh|Rangpur]], [[Dinajpur]], and [[Saidpur, Bangladesh|Saidpur]]. Once considered the poorest division in Bangladesh, with over a third of the population living in [[extreme poverty]] in 2016, according to [[World Bank]] data,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Geospatial Poverty Portal: Interactive Maps |url=https://pipmaps.worldbank.org/en/data/datatopics/poverty-portal/poverty-interactivemap |access-date=2024-01-22 |website=World Bank |language=en}}</ref> Rangpur has seen a major transformation, largely driven by industrial growth and improved infrastructure.

Rangpur is now home to thriving industries, including food processing, textiles, and light engineering, especially in cities like Rangpur and Saidpur. The establishment of manufacturing units for ceramics, electronics, and consumer goods has stimulated the local economy, creating jobs and attracting investment. Saidpur has also become a center for railway workshops and an expanding light engineering sector. The expansion of natural gas lines, better road infrastructure, and enhanced rail connectivity have been crucial to supporting these industries, allowing for more efficient production and distribution across the region.

While agriculture remains important, with Rangpur being a key producer of rice, potatoes, and sugarcane, it is the rise of industry and infrastructure that has accelerated the division’s economic progress. The development of industrial zones, access to utilities like gas and electricity, and improved transport networks have positioned Rangpur as a growing hub for industry and commerce, helping lift the division out of its past struggles.

This industrial and infrastructural growth reflects the determination and innovation of the people, transforming Rangpur into a region of increasing prosperity.

== History ==
[[Man Singh I|Mansingh]], commander of [[Emperor Akbar]], conquered part of Rangpur in 1575. Rangpur came completely under the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal empire]] in 1686. Mughalbasa and Mughalhat of Kurigram district still bear marks of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rule in the region. During the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rule part of Rangpur was under the [[Sarkar (administrative division)|sarkar]] of [[Ghoraghat Upazila|Ghoraghat]], and part under the sarkar of Pinjarah.<ref>{{cite book |author=Nasrin Akhter |chapter=Sarkar |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Sarkar |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |editor=Sirajul Islam and Ahmed A. Jamal |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]] |year=2012 |edition=Second}}</ref> Rangapur [[Ghoraghat Upazila|Ghoraghat]] has been mentioned in the [[Riyaz-us-Salatin]]. During the early period of the company rule [[Fakir-Sannyasi Rebellion]] and peasant rebellion were held in Rangpur.

== Administrative divisions ==
Rangpur Division was formed by taking 8 northern districts of [[Rajshahi Division]]. Now it has 8 [[District|Districts]], 58 [[Upazila]]s, 1 [[City Corporations in Bangladesh|City Corporation]], 21 [[Pourasava]]s and 536 [[Union councils of Bangladesh|Union councils]].
