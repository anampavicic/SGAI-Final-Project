'''Winnipeg''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=Winnipeg.ogg|ˈ|w|ɪ|n|ᵻ|p|ɛ|ɡ}}) is the capital and largest city of the province of [[Manitoba]] in Canada. It is centred on the [[confluence]] of the [[Red River of the North|Red]] and [[Assiniboine River|Assiniboine]] rivers, near the [[Longitude|longitudinal centre]] of North America. {{As of|2021}}, Winnipeg had a city population of 749,607 and a metropolitan population of 834,678, making it Canada's [[List of the largest municipalities in Canada by population|sixth-largest]] city and [[List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada|eighth-largest]] metropolitan area.<ref name=2021Metrocensus/>

The city is named after the nearby [[Lake Winnipeg]]; the name comes from the [[Cree language|Western Cree]] words for "muddy water" – ''winipīhk''. The region was a trading centre for [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous peoples]] long before the arrival of Europeans; it is the traditional territory of the Anishinabe (Ojibway), Ininew (Cree), Oji-Cree, Dene, and Dakota, and is the birthplace of the [[Métis people in Canada|Métis Nation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://winnipeg.ca/indigenous/pdfs/CoW-Indigenous-Accord.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200430104129/https://www.winnipeg.ca/indigenous/pdfs/CoW-Indigenous-Accord.pdf |archivedate=30 April 2020 |url-status=live|publisher=City of Winnipeg|title=Winnipeg's Indigenous Accord|accessdate=3 June 2021}}</ref> French traders built the first fort, [[Fort Rouge (fortification)|Fort Rouge]], on the site in 1738. A settlement was later founded by the [[Red River Colony|Selkirk settlers]] of the Red River Colony in 1812, the nucleus of which was incorporated as the City of Winnipeg in 1873. Being far inland, [[#Climate|the city's climate]] is extremely seasonal (continental) even by Canadian standards, with average January highs of around {{convert|-11|C}} and average July highs of {{convert|26|C}}.

Known as the "Gateway to the West", Winnipeg is a railway and transportation hub with a diversified economy. This multicultural city hosts numerous annual festivals, including the [[Festival du Voyageur]], the [[Winnipeg Folk Festival]], the [[Jazz Winnipeg Festival]], the [[Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival]], and [[Folklorama]]. Winnipeg was the first Canadian host of the [[1967 Pan American Games|Pan American Games in 1967]]. It is home to several professional sports franchises, including the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]] (Canadian football), [[Winnipeg Jets]] (ice hockey), [[Manitoba Moose]] (ice hockey), [[Valour FC]] ([[association football|soccer]]), [[Winnipeg Sea Bears]] (basketball), and the [[Winnipeg Goldeyes]] (baseball).

== Etymology ==
Winnipeg is named after nearby [[Lake Winnipeg]], {{Convert|65|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the city. English explorer [[Henry Kelsey]] may have been the first European to see the lake in 1690. He adopted the [[Cree language|Cree]] and [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] name {{lang|oj|win-nipi}} (also transcribed {{lang|oj|win-nipiy}} or {{lang|oj|ouenpig}}) meaning "murky water" or "muddy water"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ham|first=Penny|title=Place Names of Manitoba|publisher=Western Producer Prairie Books|year=1980|isbn=9780888330673|page=138}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=Canadian Oxford Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-19-541816-6|editor-last=Barber|editor-first=Katherine|chapter=Winnipeg, Lake}}</ref><ref name="boyens">{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=The Encyclopedia of Manitoba|publisher=Great Plains Publications|year=2007|isbn=978-1-894-283-71-7|editor-last=Boyens|editor-first=Ingeborg|pages=383, 744}}</ref> (modern {{Langx|cr|script=Latn|wīnipēk}}, {{lang|cr-Cans|ᐑᓂᐯᐠ}}). French-Canadian fur trader [[Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La Vérendrye|La Vérendrye]] referred to the lake as {{Lang|fr|Lac Gouinipique}} or {{Lang|fr|Ouinipigon}} when he built the first forts in the area in the 1730s.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bellin|first=M.|title=Remarques sur la Carte de l'Amérique Septentrionale|publisher=Didot|year=1755|page=73}}</ref> Local newspaper ''The Nor'-Wester'' included the name on its masthead on 24 February 1866, and the city was incorporated by that name by the [[Manitoba Legislature]] in 1873.<ref name=boyens />

=== Early history ===
Winnipeg lies at the [[confluence]] of the [[Assiniboine River|Assiniboine]] and the [[Red River Valley|Red River of the North]], a location now known as "[[The Forks, Winnipeg|the Forks]]."
