==Etymology==
The term Bissau may have come from the name of a clan N'nssassun, in its plural form Bôssassun.<ref name="Nanque"/> Intchassu (Bôssassu) was the name given to the nephew of King Mecau—the first sovereign of the [[island of Bissau]]—son of his sister Pungenhum. Bôssassu formed a clan of the [[Papel people]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|title=O casamento tradicional na Guiné-Bissau|url=https://www.africaeafricanidades.com.br/documentos/0010260042018.pdf|page=4|url-status=live|access-date=2021-04-19|archive-date=2020-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200712164848/http://www.africaeafricanidades.com.br/documentos/0010260042018.pdf}}</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Bissau}}
From well before the arrival of Europeans to the early 20th century, the island of Bissau was governed as a kingdom inhabited by the [[Papel people]]. According to oral tradition, the kingdom was founded by Mecau, the son of the king of [[Quinara]] ([[Guinala]]), who moved to the area with his pregnant sister, six wives, and subjects of his father's kingdom. The kingdom was composed of seven clans, descended from the sister and six wives. The Bossassun clan, which descends from the sister, inherited the throne.<ref name="Nanque">{{Cite thesis |last=Nanque |first=Neemias Antonio |title=Revoltas e resistências dos Papéis da Guiné-Bissau contra o Colonialismo Português – 1886–1915 |date=2016 |type=Trabalho de conclusão de curso |publisher=Universidade da Integração Internacional da Lusofonia Afro-Brasileira |url=https://repositorio.unilab.edu.br/jspui/bitstream/123456789/778/3/2016_mono_nnanque.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220920143123/https://repositorio.unilab.edu.br/jspui/bitstream/123456789/778/3/2016_mono_nnanque.pdf |archive-date=2022-09-20 |access-date=24 November 2022}}</ref> The Kingdom of Bissau was highly stratified.{{sfn|Rodney|1966|pp=73}} The king's coronation involved the practice of binding and beating the king, as the king should know what punishment felt like before administering it, as well as the presentation of a spear, the royal badge of office.{{sfn|Rodney|1966|pp=66}} When the Portuguese began to trade there in the 16th century, the king of Bissau was among the most supportive monarchs of the region. In 1680 Bissau even helped the Portuguese in a conflict with the Papels of Cacheu.{{sfn|Rodney|1966|pp=304}}

The city was founded in 1687 as a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] trading post.<ref name=Europa2001>{{cite book|publisher=[[Europa Publications]] |title=Political Chronology of Africa |series=Political Chronologies of the World |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0O86sZdHfHUC |isbn=0203409957 |year= 2001 |chapter= Guinea-Bissau |pages= 208–213 
}}</ref> During this same period [[France|French]] activities in the area were increasing. Although the king of Bissau Bacompolco refused them permission to build a fort, he did grant them a trading factory, from which they shipped thousands of slaves, among other things. In response the Portuguese {{ill|Conselho Ultramarino|pt}} established the captaincy-general of Bissau, and by 1696 the town had [[Fortaleza de São José da Amura|a fort]], a church, and a hospital.{{sfn|Mendy|Lobban|2013|pp=54}} It was the main emporium for trade on and south of the [[Geba river]],{{sfn|Rodney|1966|pp=289}} and was rivaling if not eclipsing [[Cacheu]] in importance.{{sfn|Rodney|1966|pp=305}}

Bacompulco died in 1696. King Incinhate emerged from the ensuing succession dispute despite tacit Portuguese opposition, and relations rapidly deteriorated.{{sfn|Rodney|1966|pp=313}} When Captain-General Pinheiro tried to enforce Portugal's monopoly in defiance of the Papel policy of free trade, Incinhate surrounded the incomplete fort and threatened to massacre the inhabitants. Pinheiro later died in Papel custody.{{sfn|Rodney|1966|pp=316}} Unable to enforce a trading monopoly or collect duties from foreign shipping, the Portuguese soon abandoned the fort.{{sfn|Rodney|1966|pp=322}} They returned in 1753 but, faced with determined Papel resistance, were unable to build a new fort and left two years later.{{sfn|Mendy|Lobban|2013|pp=54}}

The [[Fortaleza de São José da Amura|fort]] was rebuilt by the [[Grão Pará and Maranhão Company]] in 1775 to better project Portuguese power and store more slaves for shipment to [[Brazil]].{{sfn|Mendy |Lobban|2013|pp=54}} Real control of the area, however, remained in the hands of the Papel kings.{{sfn|Mendy|Lobban|2013|pp=299}} In 1869, as part of an effort to more efficiently govern the territory, Bissau was raised to the status of commune.{{sfn|Mendy|Lobban|2013|pp=55}}

The decades on either side of the turn of the 20th century saw fierce resistance on the part of the Papels to colonial 'pacification campaigns.' In 1915 after 30 years of war, the Portuguese under the command of Officer [[João Teixeira Pinto|Teixeira Pinto]] and warlord [[Abdul Injai]] defeated the Kingdom of Bissau and permanently incorporated it into [[Portuguese Guinea]].<ref name=":3">{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Joye L. |date=22 January 2009 |title=Abdul Njai: Ally and Enemy of the Portuguese in Guinea-Bissau, 1895–1919 |journal=  The Journal of African History|volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=463–479 |doi=10.1017/S0021853700023276 |s2cid=162344466}}</ref>{{rp|9}} In 1941 the capital was transferred from [[Bolama (town)|Bolama]] to Bissau.<ref name=Europa2001/> 1959 saw the bloody repression of a dockworkers' strike, a key event that pushed the nationalists towards armed resistance.{{sfn|Mendy | Lobban|2013|pp=55}}

After the declaration of independence by the anti-colonial guerrillas of [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde|PAIGC]] in 1973, the capital of the rebel territories was declared to be [[Madina do Boe]], while Bissau remained the colonial capital. The city was attacked in 1968 and 1971 by nationalist forces.{{sfn|Mendy|Lobban|2013|pp=56}} When Portugal granted independence, following the [[Carnation Revolution|military coup of April 25]] in [[Lisbon]], Bissau became the capital of the newly independent state.

Bissau was the scene of intense fighting during the beginning and end of the [[Guinea-Bissau Civil War]] in 1998 and 1999.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Guinea-Bissau |url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=68&regionSelect=2-Southern_Africa# |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231000016/http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=68&regionSelect=2-Southern_Africa |archive-date=2013-12-31 |access-date=July 12, 2013 |website=[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]] Conflict Encyclopedia |publisher=Uppsala University}}</ref> Much of the infrastructure was destroyed and most of the population fled. The city rebounded after peace returned, holding more than 25% of the country's population during the 2009 census and witnessing the erection of many new and rehabilitated buildings.{{sfn|Mendy|Lobban|2013|pp=55}}

On October 18, 2023, a city-wide blackout occurred due to an unpaid power bill to the Turkish power firm [[Karpowership]] which was over $15 million.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2023-10-18 |title=Guinea-Bissau capital without power over unpaid bill to Turkey's Karpowership |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67143386 |access-date=2023-10-18}}</ref>

==Geography and climate==
[[File:DC - Foto Serra No 142 - Vista aérea parcial e Ilhéu do Rei - Bissau.jpg|thumb|380px|center|View of downtown Bissau in the 1960s as the capital of Portuguese Guinea]]
Bissau is located on the [[Geba River]] estuary, off the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The land surrounding the city is extremely low-lying, and the river is accessible to ocean-going vessels despite its modest discharge for about {{convert|80|km|mi}} beyond the city.

Bissau has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Aw''), not quite wet enough to qualify as a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (''Am'') but much wetter than most climates of its type.

Almost no rain falls from November to May, but during the remaining five months of the year, the city receives around {{convert|2000|mm|in}} of rain.
