San Bernardino was named in 1810, when Spanish priest [[Francisco Dumetz]] led an expedition through the area. In 1839, the Mexican government granted [[Californio]] ranchero [[José del Carmen Lugo]] the right to settle the area, which was formalized when he was granted [[Rancho San Bernardino]] in 1842. Following the American [[Conquest of California]], the community on the rancho incorporated as a city in 1854.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbcity.org/cityhall/library/services/history/default.asp|title=City of San Bernardino - Local History}}</ref> The city grew significantly in the late 19th century as a commercial hub at the crossroads between Southern California and the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]]. Today, San Bernardino is an important hub for the Inland Empire and Southern California.

==History==
{{Main|History of San Bernardino, California}}
{{See also| Timeline of San Bernardino, California history}}

=== Indigenous ===
The city of San Bernardino, California, occupies much of the [[San Bernardino Valley]], a valley long inhabited by the [[Tongva]]. Several of their villages dotted the San Bernardino valley prior to the arrival of Europeans in the valley. [[Kaawchama]] was perhaps the most significant in the region, being a regional center for trade that was connected to villages in [[Southern California]] and the [[Colorado River]] through the [[Mohave Trail]], that was used by the [[Mohave people|Mohave]], [[Serrano people|Serrano]], [[Cahuilla]], [[Payomkawichum]], and others.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":7">{{Cite book |last=Crafts |first=E.

===Spanish and Mexican era===
With the establishment of [[Mission San Gabriel]] in 1771, [[Spanish missions in the Americas|Spanish missionaries]] traveling through the area expressed a desire to establish a supply station in the area, which became the [[Guachama Rancheria]].<ref name=":7" /> The settlement was also referred to as [[Politana, California|Politana]] and became the first Spanish settlement in what they referred to as San Bernardino Valley, named for [[Bernardino of Siena]], being established in 1810 as a mission chapel and supply station by the [[Mission San Gabriel]].<ref name="History" />{{rp|37–41}}

Two years later the settlement was destroyed by local tribesmen, following powerful earthquakes that shook the region. Several years later, the [[Serrano people|Serrano]] and [[Cahuilla|Mountain Cahuilla]] rebuilt the [[Guachama Rancheria]], and in 1819 invited the missionaries to return to the valley. They did and established the [[San Bernardino de Sena Estancia]]. Serrano and Cahuilla people inhabited Politana until long after the 1830s decree of secularization and the 1842 inclusion into the [[Rancho San Bernardino]] land grant of the [[José del Carmen Lugo]] family.<ref name="History">{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/historyofsanbern00caba|title=History of San Bernardino Valley from the padres to the pioneers, 1810-1851|first=Juan|last=Caballeria y Collell|date=March 6, 1902|publisher=[San Bernardino, Cal., Times-index Press|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>{{rp|37–41}}

===Post-Conquest era===
[[File:SanBernardino-1852.jpg|thumb|left|View of San Bernardino in 1852]]

The area was not largely settled until 1851, following the American [[Conquest of California]]. The first [[English-American|Anglo-American]] colony was established by pioneers associated with [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. Following the Mormon colonists' purchase of Rancho San Bernardino, and the establishment of the town of San Bernardino in 1851, San Bernardino County was formed in 1853 from parts of [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]]. Mormons laid out the town based on the "City of Zion" plan which was typical of Mormon urban planning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eom.byu.edu/index.php/City_Planning|title = City Planning – the Encyclopedia of Mormonism}}</ref> Mormon colonists developed irrigated, commercial farming and lumbering, supplying agricultural produce and lumber throughout Southern California.

The city was officially incorporated in 1857. Later that year, most of the colonists were recalled by [[Brigham Young]] in 1857 due to the [[Utah War]]. Once highly regarded in early California, news of the [[Mountain Meadows Massacre]] poisoned attitudes toward the Mormons. Some Mormons would stay in San Bernardino and some later returned from [[Utah]], but a real estate consortium from [[El Monte, California|El Monte]] and Los Angeles bought most of the lands of the old rancho and of the departing colonists. They sold these lands to new settlers who came to dominate the culture and politics in the county and San Bernardino became a typical American frontier town. Many of the new land owners disliked the sober Mormons, indulging in drinking at saloons now allowed in the town. Disorder, fighting and violence in the vicinity became common, reaching a climax in the 1859 Ainsworth - Gentry Affair.

In 1860 a gold rush began in the mountains nearby with the discovery of gold by [[William F. Holcomb]] in [[Holcomb Valley]] early 1860. Another strike followed in the upper reach of Lytle Creek. By the 1860s, San Bernardino had also become an important trading hub in [[Southern California]]. The city already on the [[Mormon Road#Los Angeles – Salt Lake Road 1855–1905|Los Angeles – Salt Lake Road]], became the starting point for the [[Mojave Road]] from 1858 and [[Bradshaw Trail]] from 1862 to the mines along the [[Colorado River]] and within the [[Arizona Territory]] in the [[Colorado River Gold Rush|gold rush of 1862–1864]].

<!--The following should be combined somehow with the paragraph before last-->
Near San Bernardino is a naturally formed arrowhead-shaped rock formation on the side of a mountain. It measures 1375 feet by 449 feet. According to the Native American legend regarding the landmark arrowhead, an arrow from Heaven burned the formation onto the mountainside in order to show tribes where they could be healed. During the mid-19th century, "Dr." David Noble Smith claimed that a saint-like being appeared before him and told of a far-off land with exceptional climate and curative waters, marked by a gigantic arrowhead. Smith's search for that unique arrowhead formation began in Texas, and eventually ended at Arrowhead Springs in California in 1857.

By 1889, word of the springs, along with the hotel on the site (and a belief in the effect on general health of the water from the springs) had grown considerably. Hotel guests often raved about the crystal-clear water from the cold springs, which prompted Seth Marshall to set up a bottling operation in the hotel's basement. By 1905, water from the cold springs was being shipped to Los Angeles under the newly created [[Arrowhead Water|"Arrowhead" trademark]].

Indigenous people of the San Bernardino Valley and Mountains were collectively identified by Spanish explorers in the 19th century as [[Serrano (people)|Serrano]], a term meaning highlander. Serrano living near what is now Big Bear Lake were called Yuhaviatam, or "People of the Pines". In 1866, to clear the way for settlers and gold miners, state militia conducted a 32-day campaign slaughtering men, women, and children.<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.sanmanuel-nsn.gov/culture_history.php.html |url-status=dead |publisher=San Manuel Band of Mission Indians |access-date=November 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823043732/http://www.sanmanuel-nsn.gov/culture_history.php.html |archive-date=August 23, 2014}}</ref> Yuhaviatam leader Santos Manuel guided his people from their ancient homeland to a village site in the San Bernardino foothills. The United States government in 1891 established it as a tribal reservation and named it after Santos Manuel.

In 1867, the first Chinese immigrants arrived in San Bernardino.

In 1883, [[California Southern Railroad]] established a rail link through San Bernardino between Los Angeles and the rest of the country.

In 1905, the city of San Bernardino passed its first charter.

[[Norton Air Force Base]] was established during [[World War II]]. In 1994, Norton Air Force Base closed to become [[San Bernardino International Airport]].

In 1940, [[Richard and Maurice McDonald]] founded [[McDonald's]], along with its innovative restaurant concept, in the city.<ref>''[[Modern Marvels]]'' "Fast Food Tech"; [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]; Viewed December 3, 2009</ref>

In 1955, [[Glen Bell]] started his first taco stand after learning from Gloria Hoyle at Mitla Café, later developing into the first Taco Bell.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Arellano |first1=Gustavo |title=Column: At the cafe that inspired Taco Bell, 'I'm afraid to talk politics. ...

On May 12, 1989, a [[San Bernardino train disaster|massive derailment]] took place along Duffy street at the Muscoy area, killing 4 people and destroying seven homes. Then on May 25, an underground petroleum pipeline ruptured, killing 2 more people and burning down 11 more homes.

In August 2012, San Bernardino filed for [[Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy code|Chapter 9 bankruptcy]], with more than $1 billion in debt.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bankrupty-san-bernardino-idUSBRE87105220120802|title=San Bernardino, California, files for bankruptcy with over $1 billion in debts|date=August 2, 2012|work=Reuters|access-date=June 12, 2017}}</ref> The move froze the city's payments to creditors, including its pension payments to the [[CalPERS|California Public Employees' Retirement System]] for nearly a year.

==Geography==
[[File:Sb 2004 dt skyline 006a.jpg|thumb|left|250px|View of Downtown San Bernardino]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|59.6|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|59.2|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.4|sqmi|km2}}, or 0.74%, is water.

The city lies in the San Bernardino foothills and the eastern portion of the [[San Bernardino Valley]], roughly {{convert|60|mi|km}} east of Los Angeles. Some major geographical features of the city include the [[San Bernardino Mountains]] and the [[San Bernardino National Forest]], in which the city's northernmost neighborhood, Arrowhead Springs, is located. At the base of the mountains lies the [[San Andreas Fault]], which passes through the northern areas of the city, and where several smaller faults lie in close proximity. The [[Cajon Pass]] adjacent to the northwest border; City Creek, [[Lytle Creek (California)|Lytle Creek]], [[San Timoteo Creek]], Twin Creek, Warm Creek (as modified through flood control channels) feed the [[Santa Ana River]], which forms part of the city's southern border south of [[San Bernardino International Airport]]. The city has several notable hills and mountains; among them are [[Shandin Hills|Perris Hill]] (named after Fred Perris, an early engineer, and the namesake of [[Perris, California]]); [[Shandin Hills|Kendall Hill]] (which is near California State University); and Little Mountain, which rises among [[Shandin Hills]] (generally bounded by Sierra Way, 30th Street, Kendall Drive, and [[Interstate 215 (California)|Interstate 215]]).

San Bernardino is unique among Southern Californian cities because of its wealth of water, which is mostly contained in underground aquifers.

Seccombe Lake, named after a former mayor, is a [[Water reservoir|manmade lake]] at Sierra Way and 5th Street.

===Climate===
[[File:Sbsnow 2.jpg|thumb|250px| January snowfall in the eastern San Bernardino Valley, [[Shandin Hills]] are visible in the background.]]
San Bernardino features a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]) with warm winters and hot, dry summers. Relative to other areas in Southern California, winters are colder, with frost and with chilly to cold morning temperatures common. The particularly arid climate during the summer prevents tropospheric clouds from forming, meaning temperatures rise to what is considered by NOAA scientists as Class Orange. Summer thus has temperatures approaching those typical of hot desert climates, with the highest recorded summer temperature at {{convert|118|°F|°C|abbr=on}} on July 6, 2018.<ref name= Weather.com >{{cite web

[[Arrowhead Springs]], San Bernardino's northernmost neighborhood gets snow, heavily at times, due to its elevation of about {{convert|3000|ft|m}} above sea level.

The seasonal [[Santa Ana wind]]s are felt particularly strongly in the San Bernardino area as warm and dry air is channeled through nearby [[Cajon Pass]] at times during the autumn months. This phenomenon markedly increases the wildfire danger in the foothills, canyon, and mountain communities that the cycle of cold, wet winters and dry summers helps create.

The city's location close to the [[Cajon Pass|Cajon]] and [[San Gorgonio Pass|San Gorgonio]] passes, and at the junctions of the [[I-10]], I-215, and SR-210 freeways, positions it as an intermodal logistics hub.
