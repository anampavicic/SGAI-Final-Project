===Migrants===
According to a study carried out by Vidyasagar University, "Most of these industrial units were located in riverine towns. A few of these were old towns inhabited previously by middle class Bengali 'babus' while others were new towns grown out of agricultural lands... Agriculture in Bengal was more remunerative than work in the jute mills but what the jute mills paid was enough to attract labour from Bihar, Orissa, U.P. first and then from C.P. or even Madras...The industrial 'mohallas' remained as '[[ghetto]]s'. There was little or no interconnection or social and cultural contact between local Bengali population and the mill hands. Both lived in their own worlds."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://inet.vidyasagar.ac.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/1245/2/2.pdf  | title = Industrialisation and Emergence of Labour Force in Bengal during The Colonial Period: Its Socio-Economic Impact | first = Nirban |last= Basu  | publisher = Vidyasagar University Journal of History, Vol 1, 2012-13  | access-date =  16 July 2018}}</ref>

Naihati has a vibrant industrial area. "Once upon a time, mill sirens would keep the time in Naihati. Sirens at six o'clock, at nine o'clock, at eleven o'clock… Pulse of the factories would impart a collective sense of time, a sense of discipline, a united communal life. Even before the break of dawn tea shops in factory premises and even in far off places, would open shutters. Lines of pedestrians and cyclists would be seen going to work. Night shift workers would come out in hordes to make way for the morning shift." Most of the factories in Naihati-Garifa area have closed down. Workers and employees are in an unbearable state, and the socio-cultural environment of a much larger area has been vitiated.<ref name=sanhati>{{cite web | url =  http://sanhati.com/excerpted/1235/ | title =  Save Naihati Industrial Area Forum | publisher =  Sanhati | access-date =  13 July 2018}}</ref> A brief about the past industries follows.

* Jenson & Nicholson was established in India in 1922 by its parent company Berger-Jenson & Nicholson, UK. The first factory of Jenson & Nicholson at Naihati went into production in 1925. The company produces paints, pigments, varnishes and allied products. The foreign holdings in the company were bought over by S.P.Sinha in 1964. The Naihati paint factory was modernised in the late 1980s. Bijay Chandra Srivastava has been managing director from 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url =  https://www.scribd.com/document/57456189/Jenson-Company-Profile-Abhi | title =  Jenson & Nicholson (India) Ltd.| work = Company Profile  | publisher =  Scribd | access-date =  12 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =  https://www.goodreturns.in/company/jenson-nicholson-india/history.html | title = Jenson & Nicholson (India) Ltd. | work = Company history and Growth Details | publisher = Good Returns  | access-date =  7 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =  https://www.zaubacorp.com/company/JENSON-NICHOLSON-INDIA-LTD/L51597WB1922PLC004603 | title =  Jenson & Nicholson (India) Ltd.  | publisher =  Zauba Corp | access-date =  7 July 2018}}</ref>
* Gouripore Jute Mill at Naihati was once upon a time considered by many as the best jute mill in the World. The fairy-tale jute mill environment of the colonial era has been succinctly described by Soumitra Das in ''The Telegraph'', "The mill had its own train and its engine was a museum piece. It carried coal to the power house. The Gouripur mill had its own water filter plant and captive electricity and water supply system...The mill opened in 1862...Gouripore Jute Mills originally belonged to the Inchcape Group under Barry & Co. Later, in 1948, following amalgamation in 1948, MacNeill & Barry owned three jute mills — Gouripore, Nuddea and Ganges Manufacturing at Bansberia. Naihati bustled with activity owing to the presence of Jenson Nicholson, Gouripur Electric Supply and Containers and Closures alongside what was the largest and best jute mill of those times." The Scottish owners left, Gouripore Jute Mill changed hands and was closed in 1998.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.telegraphindia.com/1080111/jsp/frontpage/story_8769612.jsp  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180630011955/https://www.telegraphindia.com/1080111/jsp/frontpage/story_8769612.jsp  | url-status = dead  | archive-date = 30 June 2018  | title = Golden fibre days |first= Soumitra | last=Das| publisher = The Telegraph, 11 January 2008  | access-date =  12 July 2018}}</ref><ref name=telegraph>{{cite web | url =  https://www.telegraphindia.com/1100801/jsp/calcutta/story_12752048.jsp | archive-url =  https://web.archive.org/web/20100927205357/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1100801/jsp/calcutta/story_12752048.jsp | url-status =  dead | archive-date =  27 September 2010 | title = A little bit of Scotland | first=Soumitra| last= Das  | publisher =  The Telegraph, 1 August 2010| access-date =  7 July 2018}}</ref><ref name=jutecomm>{{cite web  | url = http://jutecomm.gov.in/closure.htm  | title = Mills under suspension of work as on 26 June 2009  | publisher = Jute Commissioner, Government of India  | access-date = 12 July 2018  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180717002218/http://jutecomm.gov.in/closure.htm  | archive-date = 17 July 2018  | url-status = dead  }}</ref>
