'''Orlando''' ({{IPAc-en|ɔr|ˈ|l|æ|n|d|oʊ}} {{Respell|or|LAN|doh}}) is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Orange County, Florida]], United States. Part of [[Central Florida]], it is the center of the [[Greater Orlando|Orlando metropolitan area]], which had a population of 2,509,831 in 2017, according to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]]. It is the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the [[Southern United States]] and the third-largest metropolitan area in Florida behind [[Miami metropolitan area|Miami]] and [[Tampa Bay area|Tampa Bay]]. Orlando had a city population of 307,573 in the 2020 census, making it the fourth-most populous city in Florida behind [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Miami]], and [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.orlando.gov/files/sharedassets/public/v/1/departments/edv/city-planning/growth-projections-2022/2022-to-2050-growth-projections-report-october-2020.pdf |title=Growth Management Plan: 2022 – 2050 Growth Projections Report |date=October 2022 |publisher=City of Orlando |access-date=August 13, 2024}}</ref> In July 2023, its population was 320,742 inhabitants. It is the state's most populous inland city.

Orlando is one of the most-visited cities in the world primarily due to tourism, major events, and convention traffic. It is the third-most visited city in the U.S. after [[New York City]] and [[Miami]], with over 2.9 million visitors as of 2022.<ref>[https://www.worldatlas.com/cities/america-s-10-most-visited-cities.html "America's 10 most visited cities"], World Atlas, December 5, 2023</ref> [[Orlando International Airport]] is the 13th-busiest airport in the United States and the 29th-busiest in the world.<ref>[http://www.airports.org/cda/aci_common/display/main/aci_content07_c.jsp?zn=aci&cp=1-5-212-218-224_666_2__ Passenger Traffic for past 12 months ending May 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812030729/http://www.airports.org/cda/aci_common/display/main/aci_content07_c.jsp?zn=aci&cp=1-5-212-218-224_666_2__ |date=August 12, 2011 }}.

With the exception of the theme parks, most major cultural sites like the [[Orlando Museum of Art]] and [[Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts]] and world-renowned nightlife, bars and clubs are located in Downtown Orlando. Other attractions like [[Orlando Eye]] at [[ICON Park]] are located along [[International Drive]]. The city is also one of the busiest American cities for conferences and conventions; [[Orange County Convention Center]] is the second-largest convention facility in the United States.

Like other major cities in the [[Sun Belt]], Orlando grew rapidly from the 1960s into the first decade of the 21st century. Orlando is home to the [[University of Central Florida]], which became the [[List of United States university campuses by enrollment|largest university campus in the United States]] in terms of enrollment as of 2015.{{update inline|date=April 2022}} In 2010, Orlando was listed as a "Gamma+" level [[global city]] by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The World According to GaWC 2020 |url=https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2020t.html |website=GaWC – Research Network |publisher=Globalization and World Cities |access-date=August 31, 2020}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Fort Gatlin, as the Orlando area was once known, was established at what is now just south of the city limits by the [[4th U.S. Artillery]] under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Alexander C. W. Fanning on November 9, 1838, during the construction of a series of fortified encampments across Florida during the [[Second Seminole War]].<ref name=FLhistorical>{{cite web |url=https://myfloridahistory.org/date-in-history/fort-gatlin-established |title=Fort Gatlin established |website=myfloridahistory.org |publisher=Florida Historical Society |access-date=March 1, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302114957/https://myfloridahistory.org/date-in-history/fort-gatlin-established |archive-date=March 2, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The fort and surrounding area were named for John S. Gatlin, an Army physician who was killed in [[Dade's Massacre]] on December 28, 1835. The site of construction for Fort Gatlin, a defensible position with fresh water between three small lakes, was likely chosen because the location was on a main trail and is less than 250 yards from a nearby Council Oak tree, where [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] had traditionally met. [[Ee-mat-la|King Phillip]] and [[Wild Cat (Seminole)|Coacoochee]] frequented this area and the tree was alleged to be the place where the previous [[Dade's Massacre|1835 ambush]] that had killed over 100 soldiers had been planned.<ref name=Dickenson2003>{{cite web |url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2003/07/06/giant-council-oak-is-gone-but-its-presence-is-felt/ |title=Giant Council Oak Is Gone, But Its Presence Is Felt|last= Wallace Dickinson|first= Joy|date=July 6, 2003 |work=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=March 1, 2017 }}</ref> When the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] abandoned the fort in 1839, the surrounding community was built up by settlers.<ref name=FLhistorical />

Prior to being known by its current name, Orlando was once known as Jernigan. This name originates from the first European permanent settlers, Issac and [[Aaron Jernigan]], cattlemen who moved from the state of Georgia and acquired land {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=}} northwest of Fort Gatlin along the west end of Lake Holden in July 1843 by the terms of the [[Armed Occupation Act]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Dickinson|first=Joy Wallace|title=Orlando : city of dreams|year=2003|publisher=Arcadia Pub.|location=Charleston, South Carolina|isbn=978-0-7385-2442-9|pages=21–22}}</ref><ref name= Andrews2000>{{cite web |url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2000/05/07/sites-key-to-orlando-history-fort-gatlin/ |title=Site's Key To Orlando History: Fort Gatlin|last= Andrews|first=Mark |date=May 7, 2000 |work=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=March 1, 2017 }}</ref> Aaron Jernigan became Orange County's first state representative in 1845, but his pleas for additional military protection went unanswered.<ref>{{Cite web |last=By |date=June 14, 1998 |title=AARON JERNIGAN: POSTMASTER, LEGISLATOR – MURDER SUSPECT |url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/1998/06/14/aaron-jernigan-postmaster-legislator-murder-suspect/ |access-date=January 8, 2024 |website=Orlando Sentinel |language=en-US}}</ref>

Fort Gatlin was briefly reoccupied by the military for a few weeks during October and November 1849, and subsequently a volunteer militia was left to defend the settlement.<ref name="Andrews2000" /> A historical marker indicates that by 1850, the Jernigan homestead (or Fort Gatlin in some sources)<ref name="Andrews1998" /> served as the nucleus of a village named Jernigan.<ref name="marker">[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMH4KB Orlando's First Settler, Aaron Jernigan] Retrieved March 2, 2017.</ref> According to an account written years later by his daughter, at that time, about 80 settlers were forced to shelter for about a year in "a [[stockade]] that Aaron Jernigan built on the north side of Lake Conway". One of the county's first records, a [[grand jury]]'s report, mentions a stockade where it states homesteaders were "driven from their homes and forced to huddle together in hasty defences [sic]." Aaron Jernigan led a local volunteer militia during 1852.<ref name="Andrews2000" />

A post office opened at Jernigan in 1850. Jernigan appears on an 1855 map of Florida, and by 1856, the area had become the [[county seat]] of Orange County.<ref name=Dickinson2005 >{{cite web |url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2005/03/13/youre-really-living-in-the-land-of-jernigan/ |title=You're Really Living in the Land of Jernigan|last=Dickinson|first=Joy Wallace|date=March 13, 2005 |work=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=March 4, 2017 }}</ref><ref name=FLhistorical /> In 1857, the post office was removed from Jernigan, and opened under the name of Orlando at a new location in present-day downtown Orlando.<ref name= Andrews2000 /> During the [[American Civil War]], the post office closed, but reopened in 1866. The move is believed to have been sparked, in part, by Aaron Jernigan's fall from grace after he was relieved of his militia command by military officials in 1856. His behavior was so notorious that [[United States Secretary of War]] [[Jefferson Davis]] wrote, "It is said they [Jernigan's militia] are more dreadful than the Indians."<ref name="Dickinson, Cheney" /> In 1859, Jernigan and his sons were accused of committing a murder at the town's post office. They were then transported to [[Ocala]], but escaped.<ref name=marker />

At a meeting in 1857, debate had grown concerning the name of the town. Pioneer William B. Hull recalled how James Speer (a local resident, and prominent figure in the stories behind the naming of Orlando) rose in the heat of the argument and said, "This place is often spoken of as 'Orlando's Grave.' Let's drop the word 'grave' and let the county seat be Orlando."<ref name="Andrews1998" /><ref name="Dickinson, Cheney" />

The origin of the name is unknown but at least five stories relate how Orlando got its name. The most common stories are that the name Orlando originated from the tale of a man who died in 1835 during an attack by Native Americans in the area during the [[Second Seminole War]]. Several of the stories relay an oral history of the marker for a person named Orlando, and the ''[[double entendre]]'', "Here lies Orlando." One variant includes a man named Orlando who was passing by on his way to [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] with a herd of [[oxen]], died, and was buried in a marked grave.<ref name="travel">[http://www.florida-backroads-travel.com/history-of-orlando.html History of Orlando] Florida Backroads Travel. Retrieved March 2, 2017.</ref>

Through a retelling of history, a marker of some sort was believed to have been found by one of the original pioneers, but Speer's family has since claimed that Speer simply used the Orlando Reeves legend to help push his plan for naming the settlement after the Shakespearean character from ''[[As You Like It]]'', his favorite play.<ref name=Andrews1998 /> This has become the most common accepted version of how Orlando got its name.

===Orlando Reeves===

Historians agree that likely no soldier was named Orlando Reeves.<ref name=Dickenson2001>{{cite web |url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2001/01/28/mystery-of-name-tracked-down-long-winding-trail/ |title=Mystery of Name Tracked Down Long, Winding Trail|last=Dickinson |first=Joy Wallace |date=January 28, 2001 |work=Orlando Sentinel |access-date=March 3, 2017 }}</ref> [[Folklore]] is that Reeves was acting as a [[Border guard|sentinel]] for a company of soldiers that had set up camp for the night on the banks of [[Lake Eola|Sandy Beach Lake]].<ref name="Dickinson, Reeves">{{cite book|last=Dickinson|first=Joy Wallace|title=Orlando: City of Dreams|year=2003|publisher=Arcadia Pub.|location=Charleston, South Carolina|isbn=978-0-7385-2442-9|pages=13–14, 24}}</ref> Several different lakes are mentioned in the various versions, as no soldiers were in what is now downtown during 1835.<ref name=Andrews1994>{{cite web |url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/1994/11/13/the-legend-of-orlandos-name-crumbles-under-expert-scrutiny/ |title=The Legend of Orlando's Name Crumbles Under Expert Scrutiny|last= Andrews|first= Mark|date= November 13, 1994|work=Orlando Sentinel |access-date=March 4, 2017 }}</ref>

The legend grew throughout the early 1900s, particularly with local historian Olive Brumbaugh (or Kena Fries<ref name="Dickinson, Reeves" />{{verify source|date=March 2017}}) retelling in various writings and on local radio station [[WDBO (AM)|WDBO]] in 1929.<ref name=Andrews1998 /> Another historian, Eldon H. Gore, promoted the Reeves legend in ''History of Orlando'' published in 1949.<ref name=Andrews1998>{{cite web |url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/1998/01/18/legendary-orlando-reeves-was-a-remarkable-man-or-was-he/ |title=Legendary Orlando Reeves Was A Remarkable Man – Or Was He?|last= Andrews|first= Mark|date= January 18, 1998 |work=Orlando Sentinel |access-date=March 3, 2017 }}</ref> A memorial beside [[Lake Eola]] – originally placed by students of Orlando's Cherokee Junior School in 1939 and updated in 1990 – designates the spot where the city's supposed namesake fell.<ref name=Dickenson2001 /><ref name="Dickinson, Reeves" />

Conflicting legends exist. One legend has Reeves killed during an extended battle with the Seminoles after being field promoted after his platoon commander fell.<ref name=Andrews1998 /> An in-depth review of military records in the 1970s and 1980s, though, turned up no record of Orlando Reeves ever existing.<ref name=Andrews1998 /><ref name=Dickenson2001 /><ref name="Dickinson, Reeves" /> Some versions attempt to account for Reeves having no military records by using the name of other people named Orlando that exist in some written records – Orlando Acosta; however, not much is known about Acosta or whether he even existed. Another version of the story has Orlando Reed, supposedly an Englishman and mail carrier between Fort Gatlin and [[Fort Mellon]], allegedly killed while camping with his friends near Fort Gatlin.<ref name=Andrews1998 />

A second variation also places the story in 1835 during the Second Seminole War. This name is taken from a [[South Carolinian]] [[cattle ranching|cattle rancher]] named Orlando Savage Rees. Rees owned a [[Volusia County]] [[sugar mill]] and [[plantation]], as well as several large estates in Florida and [[Mississippi]].<ref name=Andrews1998 /> Rees' sugar farms in the area were burned out in the Seminole attacks of 1835 (the year Orlando Reeves supposedly died). Subsequently, Rees led an expedition to recover stolen slaves and cattle. In 1837, Rees also attempted to stop a peace treaty with the Seminoles because it did not reimburse him for the loss of slaves and crops.<ref name="Dickinson, Cheney">{{cite book|last=Dickinson|first=Joy Wallace|title=Orlando: City of Dreams|year=2003|publisher=Arcadia Pub.|location=Charleston, South Carolina|isbn=978-0-7385-2442-9|pages=24–25}}</ref>

Rees could have left a pine-bough marker with his name next to the trail; later residents misread "Rees" as "Reeves" and also mistook it as a grave maker.<ref name="Dickinson, Cheney"/> In subsequent years, this story has merged with the Orlando Reeves story (which may have originally incorporated part of Dr. Gatlin's story).<ref name=Andrews1998 />

On two separate occasions, relatives of Rees claimed their ancestor was the namesake of the city. F. K. Bull of South Carolina (Rees' great-grandson) told an Orlando reporter of a story in 1955; years later, Charles M. Bull Jr., of Orlando (Rees' great-great-grandson) offered local historians similar information.<ref name="Dickinson, Cheney"/> Unlike Orlando Reeves, who cannot be traced to any historical record, the record is considerable that Orlando Rees did exist and was in Florida during that time. For example, in 1832, [[John James Audubon]] met with Rees in his large estate at Spring Garden, about 45 minutes from Orlando.<ref name="Dickinson, Cheney"/>

===Orlando (''As You Like It'')===
[[File:Lake Lucerne, Orlando, FL.jpg|thumb|Lake Lucerne, c. 1905]]

The final variation has the city named after [[Orlando (As You Like It)|the protagonist]] in the Shakespeare play ''[[As You Like It]]''.<ref name=Andrews1998 />

In 1975, Judge Donald A. Cheney put forth a new version of the story in an ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' article.<ref name="Dickinson, Cheney"/> Cheney (a local historian and then chairman of the county historical commission<ref>{{cite web |title=About |url=http://cflhistory.org/about/#:~:text=In%201957%2C%20when%20the%20red%2Dbrick%20courthouse%20was%20demolished%2C%20the%20Orange%20County%20Board%20of%20County%20Commissioners%20established%20a%20historical%20commission%20to%20manage%20the%20museum%20collection%20and%20tapped%20Judge%20Donald%20Cheney%20to%20be%20its%20first%20chairman. |website=Historical Society of Central Florida |access-date=April 17, 2022}}</ref>) recounted a story told to him by his father, Judge [[John Moses Cheney]] (a major figure in Orlando's history, who arrived in Orlando in 1885).

The elder Cheney recounted that another gentleman at that time, James Speer, proposed the name Orlando after the character in ''As You Like It''.<ref name=Andrews1998 /> According to Cheney, Speer, "was a gentleman of culture and an admirer of William Shakespeare ..."<ref name="Dickinson, Cheney" /> Quoting a letter that Speer wrote, "Orlando was a veritable [[Arden, Warwickshire|Forest of Arden]], the locale of ''As You Like It''."<ref name=Reflections>[http://www.thehistorycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Reflections_Fall2015-_lr.pdf ''Reflections'']. Fall 2015 Vol. 13 No. 4. {{Retrieved|access-date= March 1, 2017}}</ref> Speer's descendants have also confirmed this version of the naming and the legend has continued to grow.<ref name="Dickinson, Cheney" />

This account also has some validity in that, as mentioned above, Speer was instrumental in changing the name of the settlement from Jernigan to Orlando, though he may have used the Orlando Reeves legend in lieu of his true intent to use the Shakespearean character. According to yet another version of the story, Orlando may have been the name of one of his employees.<ref name=Andrews1998 /><ref name=travel /> One of [[downtown Orlando]]'s major streets is named Rosalind Avenue; [[Rosalind (As You Like It)|Rosalind]] is the heroine of ''As You Like It'', but this could also be a coincidence.

===Settlement===

In 1823, the [[Treaty of Moultrie Creek]] created a [[Seminole]] reservation encompassing much of central Florida, including the area that would become Orlando. The [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830 authorized relocation of the Seminole from Florida to Oklahoma, leading to the Second Seminole War. In 1842, white settlement in the area was encouraged by the Armed Occupation Act. The first settler, Mr. [[Aaron Jernigan]] of Camden County, Georgia, arrived the following year and settled near Lake Holden.

[[Mosquito County]] was renamed Orange County in 1845, with the county seat shortly thereafter relocated to Mellonville, a few miles west of [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]]. By 1856, settlement had begun in earnest in the interior of the county and a more centrally-located Courthouse was sought. The new town of Orlando, laid out in 1857,<ref name=FLhistorical /> consisted of four streets surrounding a courthouse square. The fledgling village suffered greatly during the [[Union blockade]]. The [[Reconstruction Era]] brought on a population explosion, resulting in the incorporation of the Town of Orlando on July 31, 1875, with 85 residents (22 voters). For a short time in 1879, the town revoked its charter, and was subsequently reincorporated.<ref name="Historic Orange County:The Story of Orlando and Orange County">{{cite book |last=Mosier |first=Tana |date=2009 |title=Historic Orange County:The Story of Orlando and Orange County |url=http://hpnbooks.com/wordpress/?p=1372 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201035737/http://hpnbooks.com/wordpress/?p=1372 |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 1, 2017 |location=Texas |publisher=Mahler Books |page=51 |isbn=9781893619999 }}</ref> Orlando was established as a city in 1885.<ref>[http://www.cityoforlando.net/about_orlando.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314190141/http://www.cityoforlando.net/about_orlando.htm|date=March 14, 2014}}</ref>

The period from 1875 to 1895 is remembered as Orlando's Golden Era, when it became the hub of Florida's [[citrus]] industry. The period ended with the [[Great Freeze|Great Freeze of 1894–95]], which forced many owners to give up their independent citrus [[Grove (nature)|grove]]s, thus consolidating holdings in the hands of a few "citrus barons", who shifted operations south, primarily around [[Lake Wales, Florida|Lake Wales]] in [[Polk County, Florida|Polk County]].<ref name=travel /> The freeze caused many in Florida, including many Orlandoans, to move elsewhere, mostly to [[Northern United States|the North]], [[California]], or the [[Caribbean]].
[[File:The Wyoming, Orlando, FL.jpg|thumb|right|The Wyoming Hotel, c. 1905]]
Notable homesteaders in the area included the Curry family. Through their property in east Orlando flowed the [[Econlockhatchee River]], which travelers crossed by [[ford (crossing)|fording]]. This was commemorated by the street's name, Curry Ford Road. Also, just south of the [[Orlando International Airport]] in the Boggy Creek area are {{convert|150|acre|km2}} of property homesteaded in the late 19th century by the Ward family. This property is still owned by the Ward family, and can be seen from southbound flights out of Orlando International Airport immediately on the south side of SR 417.

===Post-Industrial Revolution===

Orlando became a popular resort during the years between the [[Spanish–American War]] and [[World War I]]. In the 1920s, Orlando experienced extensive housing development during the [[Florida Land Boom]], causing land prices to soar. During this period, dozens of neighborhoods in the vicinity of downtown were constructed. The boom ended when several [[hurricanes]] hit Florida in the late 1920s, along with the [[Great Depression]].

During [[World War II]], a number of Army personnel were stationed at the [[Orlando Air Force Base|Orlando Army Air Base]] and nearby [[McCoy Air Force Base|Pinecastle Army Air Field]]. Some of these servicemen stayed in Orlando to settle and raise families. In 1956, the aerospace and defense company [[Martin Marietta]] (now [[Lockheed Martin]]) established a plant in the city. Orlando AAB and Pinecastle AAF were transferred to the [[United States Air Force]] in 1947 when it became a separate service and were redesignated as air force bases (AFB). In 1958, Pinecastle AFB was renamed McCoy Air Force Base after Colonel Michael N. W. McCoy, a former commander of the 320th Bombardment Wing at the installation, killed in the crash of a [[B-47]] Stratojet bomber north of Orlando. In the 1960s, the base subsequently became home to the 306th Bombardment Wing of the [[Strategic Air Command]], operating [[B-52 Stratofortress]] and [[KC-135]] Stratotanker aircraft, in addition to detachment operations by [[EC-121]] and [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] aircraft.

In 1968, Orlando AFB was transferred to the [[United States Navy]] and became Naval Training Center Orlando. In addition to boot camp facilities, the NTC Orlando was home of one of two Navy Nuclear Power Schools, and home of the [[Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division]]. When McCoy AFB closed in 1976, its runways and territory to its south and east were imparted to the city to become [[Orlando International Airport]], while a small portion to the northwest was transferred to the Navy as McCoy NTC Annex. That closed in 1995, and became a housing, though the former McCoy AFB still hosts a Navy Exchange, as well as national guard and reserve units for several branches of service. NTC Orlando was completely closed by the end of 1999 by the [[Base Realignment and Closure Commission]], and converted into the Baldwin Park neighborhood. The Naval Air Warfare Center had moved to Central Florida Research Park near UCF in 1989.

===Tourism in history===

A major factor in Orlando's growth occurred in 1962, when the new Orlando Jetport, the precursor of the present-day Orlando International Airport, was built from a portion of the McCoy Air Force Base. By 1970, four major airlines ([[Delta Air Lines]], [[National Airlines (NA)|National Airlines]], [[Eastern Airlines]], and [[Southern Airways]]) were providing scheduled flights. McCoy Air Force Base officially closed in 1975, and most of it is now part of the airport. The airport still retains the former Air Force Base airport code (MCO).

Perhaps the most critical event for Orlando's economy, though, occurred in 1965 when [[Walt Disney]] announced plans to build [[Walt Disney World]]. Although Disney had considered the regions of Miami and [[Tampa]] for his park, one of the major reasons behind his decision not to locate there was due to [[hurricane]]s – Orlando's inland location, although not free from hurricane damage, exposed it to less threat than coastal regions. The vacation resort opened in October 1971, ushering in an explosive population and economic growth for the Orlando metropolitan area, which now encompasses Orange, [[Seminole County, Florida|Seminole]], [[Osceola County, Florida|Osceola]], and [[Lake County, Florida|Lake]] Counties. As a result, tourism became the centerpiece of the area's economy. Orlando now has more [[theme park]]s and entertainment attractions than anywhere else in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Best Hotels in Orlando for AARP Members in 2017|url=https://www.expedia-aarp.com/Orlando-Hotels.d178294.Travel-Guide-Hotels|website=AARP Travel Center|publisher=Expedia|access-date=May 5, 2017}}</ref>

===21st century===
[[File:Orlando downtown 2011.jpg|thumb|View of downtown Orlando (center) and periphery to [[Lake Apopka]] (upper-right); January 2011]]

Today, the historic core of "Old Orlando" resides in [[downtown Orlando]] along Church Street, between Orange Avenue and Garland Avenue.
The urban development and the central business district of downtown have rapidly shaped the downtown skyline during recent history. The present-day [[historic district]] is primarily associated with the neighborhoods around [[Lake Eola]] but stretches west across the city to Lake Lorna Dune and north into the College Park Neighborhood where you can find century-old oaks line brick streets. These neighborhoods include the "Downtown Business District," "North Quarter," "Parramore," "Callahan," "South Eola Heights, "Lake Eola Heights,"Thornton Park" and "College Park", and contain some of the oldest homes in Orlando.

====2016 mass shooting====

{{main|Orlando nightclub shooting}}
On June 12, 2016, more than 100 people were shot at [[Pulse (nightclub)|Pulse]], a [[gay bar|gay nightclub]] in Orlando. Fifty (including the gunman) were killed and 60 were wounded. The gunman, whom the police [[SWAT team]] shot to death, was identified as 29-year-old [[Omar Mateen|Omar Mir Seddique Mateen]], an American security guard. The act of terrorism was both the deadliest [[mass shooting]] in modern United States history at the time and one of the deadliest mass shootings perpetrated by a single person in recorded world history. Mateen pledged allegiance to the Islamic State during his unsuccessful negotiations with police.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/pulse-orlando-nightclub-shooting/os-911-calls-released-orlando-shooting-20170922-story.html|title=Transcripts of 911 calls reveal Pulse shooter's terrorist motives|first=Caitlin|last=Doornbos|date=September 23, 2016 }}</ref> After the shooting, the city held numerous vigils. In November 2016, Orlando mayor Buddy Dyer announced the city's intention to acquire the Pulse Nightclub to build a permanent memorial for the 49 victims of the shooting. The city offered to buy it for $2.25&nbsp;million, but the club's owner declined to sell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/political-pulse/os-pulse-nightclub-no-sale-orlando-20161205-story.html|title=Pulse nightclub owner says she won't sell to city|first=Jeff Weiner, Gal Tziperman|last=Lotan}}</ref>

==Geography==

The geography of Orlando is mostly [[wetlands]], consisting of many lakes and swamps. The terrain is generally flat, making the land fairly low and wet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/states/Florida-Topography.html|title=Topography – Florida|website=www.city-data.com|access-date=December 4, 2018}}</ref> The area is dotted with hundreds of lakes, the largest of which is [[Lake Apopka]]. Central Florida's [[bedrock]] is mostly [[limestone]] and very porous; the Orlando area is susceptible to [[sinkholes]]. Probably the most famous incident involving a sinkhole happened in 1981 in Winter Park, a city immediately north of downtown Orlando, dubbed [[Winter Park, Florida#The Winter Park sinkhole|"The Winter Park Sinkhole]]".

There are 115 neighborhoods within the city limits and many [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated]] communities. Orlando's city limits resemble a checkerboard, with pockets of unincorporated Orange County surrounded by city limits. Such an arrangement results in some areas being served by both Orange County and the City of Orlando. This also explains Orlando's relatively low city population when compared to its metropolitan population. The city and county are working together in an effort to "round-out" the city limits with Orlando annexing portions of land already bordering the city limits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityoforlando.net/gis/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/03/AnnexationsMap34x44General.pdf |title=Map of Orlando |publisher=Cityoforlando.net |access-date=August 2, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713122906/http://www.cityoforlando.net/gis/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2014/03/AnnexationsMap34x44General.pdf |archive-date=July 13, 2014 }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=May 2014}}

At the center of the Greater Orlando region is [[Downtown Orlando]], the historic core and [[central business district]] of the city. It is bordered by Marks Street in the north, Mills Avenue ([[SR 15 (FL)|SR 15]]) in the east, [[Orange Blossom Trail]] ([[U.S. Route 441 in Florida|US 441]]) in the west, and Kaley Avenue in the south. It is home to many of the region's major banks, skyscrapers, government buildings, and cultural and tourist attractions, along with a large residential population. It is mostly composed of high-rise residential towers and office towers. Among the 79 of the high-rises in the [[Greater Orlando]] region, 46 are located in downtown.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.emporis.com/city/101340/orlando-fl-usa|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322015123/http://www.emporis.com/city/101340/orlando-fl-usa|url-status=usurped|archive-date=March 22, 2015|title=Orlando &#124; Buildings &#124; EMPORIS|website=[[Emporis]]|access-date=Aug 23, 2019}}</ref> It is also the home to many of the city's cultural venues, such as [[Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts]], [[Kia Center]], and [[Orlando Museum of Art]].

In the southwestern side of Orlando, is the main [[tourist strip]] for the city, along with some residential neighborhoods. [[International Drive]], commonly known as '''I-Drive''', is a major {{convert|11.1|mi|adj=on}} [[thoroughfare]] in the southwestern section of Orlando, serving a similar purpose to that of the [[Las Vegas Strip]] in [[Las Vegas]], as the core of the tourism area. The northern part of the strip extends into the city limits of and the remainder of the central and southern portions are all located in unincorporated [[Orange County, Florida|Orange County]]. An additional extension is known as '''International Drive South''', partly located in the northern portion of [[Osceola County, Florida|Osceola County]], but is not connected to the main stem of this route. Surrounding cross-roads include Sand Lake Road, Kirkman Road, [[State Road 536 (Florida)|SR 536]], and '''Universal Boulevard''', which runs parallel to the midsection of International Drive. At its northern end, International Drive is home to [[Orlando International Premium Outlets]] and [[Universal Orlando]] resort, along with being in close proximity to the upcoming [[Universal Epic Universe|Epic Universe]] theme park (set to open in 2025).<ref>[http://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlets/outlet.asp?id=96 Orlando Premium Outlets-International Official Website], Orlando International Premium Outlets.

===Climate===
[[File:Orlando Tstorm.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Rainy season in the city]]
According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], Orlando has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') like much of the deep Southern United States. The two basic seasons in Orlando are a hot and rainy season, lasting from May until late October (roughly coinciding with the [[Atlantic hurricane season]]), and a warm and dry season from November through April.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wesh.com/article/florida-rainy-season/27786924|title=What is the Central Florida rainy season?|first=Amy|last=Sweezey|date=June 10, 2019|website=WESH}}</ref> The area's warm and humid climate is caused primarily by its low elevation, its position relatively close to the [[Tropic of Cancer]], and its location in the center of a [[list of peninsulas|peninsula]]. Many characteristics of its climate are a result of its proximity to the [[Gulf Stream]], which flows around the peninsula of Florida.

During the height of Orlando's humid summer season, high temperatures are typically in the low 90s °F (32–34&nbsp;°C), while low temperatures rarely fall below the low 70s °F (22–24&nbsp;°C). The average window for {{convert|90|°F}} temperatures is April 9 to October 14. The area's humidity acts as a buffer, usually preventing actual temperatures from exceeding {{convert|100|°F|0}}, but also pushing the [[heat index]] to over {{convert|110|°F|0}}. The city's highest recorded temperature is {{convert|103|°F|0}}, set on September 8, 1921. During these months, strong afternoon thunderstorms occur almost daily. These storms are caused by air masses from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the Atlantic Ocean colliding over Central Florida. They are highlighted by spectacular [[lightning]] and can also bring heavy rain (sometimes several inches per hour) and powerful winds as well as rare damaging [[hail]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Thunderstorms |url=http://climatecenter.fsu.edu/topics/thunderstorms |website=Florida Climate Center |access-date=January 10, 2019}}</ref>

During the winter, humidity is much lower and temperatures are more moderate, and can fluctuate more readily. The monthly daily average temperature in January is {{convert|60.6|°F|1}}. Temperatures dip below the freezing mark on an average of only 1.6 nights per year and the lowest recorded temperature is {{convert|18|°F}}, set on [[Great Freeze|December 28, 1894]]. The annual mean minimum is just above {{convert|30|F|C}} putting Orlando in [[hardiness zone]] 10a. Because the winter season is dry and freezing temperatures usually occur only after cold fronts (and their accompanying precipitation) have passed, snow is exceptionally rare. The only accumulation ever to occur in the city proper since record keeping began was in 1948, although some accumulation occurred in surrounding areas in a snow event in January 1977 that reached Miami. Flurries have also been observed [[December 1989 United States cold wave|in 1989]], 2006,<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/weather/news/2006-11-21-florida-cold_x.htm Snow falls in central Florida as state endures unusual Nov. cold snap] ''[[USA Today]]''; Retrieved May 23, 2012</ref> and 2010.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/10/AR2010011002684.html Florida cold spell brings flurries to Orlando] ''[[The Washington Post]]''; Retrieved May 23, 2012</ref>

The average annual rainfall in Orlando is {{convert|51.45|in}}, a majority of which occurs in the period from June to September. October through May are Orlando's dry season. During this period (especially in its later months), often a [[wildfire]] hazard exists. During some years, fires have been severe. In 1998, a strong [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño]] caused an unusually wet January and February, followed by drought throughout the spring and early summer, causing a record wildfire season that created numerous air-quality alerts in Orlando and severely affected normal daily life, including the postponement of that year's [[Coke Zero 400|Pepsi 400]] [[NASCAR]] race in nearby [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1998-07-03/sports/9807020466_1_winston-tower-first-night-event-daytona-international-speedway |title=Pepsi 400 Postponed By Fires – Sun Sentinel |publisher=Articles.sun-sentinel.com |date=July 3, 1998 |access-date=October 16, 2012 |archive-date=May 7, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507083355/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1998-07-03/sports/9807020466_1_winston-tower-first-night-event-daytona-international-speedway |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Orlando is a major population center and has a considerable [[hurricane]] risk, although it is not as high as in [[South Florida]]'s urban corridor or other coastal regions. Since the city is located {{convert|42|mi|km}} inland from the Atlantic and {{convert|77|mi|km}} inland from the Gulf of Mexico,{{efn|Distance measured from Orlando City Hall to nearest Atlantic coastline, near [[Oak Hill, Florida|Oak Hill]], [[Brevard County, Florida|Brevard County]], and nearest Gulf coastline, near, [[Pine Island, Hernando County, Florida|Pine Island]], [[Hernando County, Florida|Hernando County]], using [[Google Earth]]'s Ruler tool.}} hurricanes usually weaken before arriving. Storm surges are not a concern since the region is {{convert|100|ft|m}} [[above mean sea level]]. Despite its location, the city does see strong hurricanes. During the notorious [[2004 Atlantic hurricane season|2004 hurricane season]], Orlando was hit by three hurricanes that caused significant damage, with [[Hurricane Charley]] the worst of these. The city also experienced widespread damage during [[Hurricane Donna]] in 1960.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hurricane Donna is born |url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/hurricane-donna-is-born |access-date=March 14, 2022 |website=HISTORY |language=en}}</ref>

[[Tornado]]es are not usually connected with the strong thunderstorms of the humid summer. They are more common during the infrequent cold days of winter, as well as in passing hurricanes. The two worst major outbreaks in the area's history, a [[1998 Kissimmee tornado outbreak|1998 outbreak]] that killed 42 people and a [[2007 Groundhog Day tornado outbreak|2007 outbreak]] that killed 21, both happened in February.

===Metropolitan statistical area===

{{Main|Greater Orlando}}
Orlando is the hub city of the '''[[Greater Orlando|Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area]]''', colloquially known as "'''Greater Orlando'''" or "'''Metro Orlando'''". The area encompasses four counties ([[Lake County, Florida|Lake]], [[Orange County, Florida|Orange]], [[Osceola County, Florida|Osceola]], and [[Seminole County, Florida|Seminole]]). As of 2020, the population of the [[metropolitan statistical area]] (MSA) was 2,673,376, making it the third largest in Florida and the [[Metropolitan statistical area|22nd-largest metro area]] in the United States.

When [[Combined Statistical Area]]s (CSA) were instituted in 2000, Orlando was initially joined with [[The Villages, Florida]], Micropolitan Statistical Area, to form the "Orlando-The Villages, Florida, Combined Statistical Area". In 2006, the metropolitan areas of [[Deltona, Florida|Deltona]] ([[Volusia County, Florida|Volusia County]]) and [[Palm Coast, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area|Palm Coast]] ([[Flagler County, Florida|Flagler County]]) were added to create the "Orlando-Deltona-Daytona Beach, Florida, Combined Statistical Area".<ref>[https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/bulletins/fy2007/b07-01.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825135211/http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/bulletins/fy2007/b07-01.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061225095329/http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/bulletins/fy2007/b07-01.pdf|archive-date=December 25, 2006|url-status=live|date=August 25, 2009}}</ref> As of 2020, the CSA has been renamed the '''Orlando–Lakeland–Deltona, Florida Combined Statistical Area''' and had the [[Combined statistical area|15th highest population]] in the US, with a total of 4,197,095 people.

===Industry===

Orlando is a major industrial and [[hi-tech]] center. The metro area has a $13.4&nbsp;billion technology industry employing 53,000 people;{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} and is a nationally recognized cluster of innovation in digital media, agricultural technology, aviation, aerospace, and software design. More than 150 international companies, representing approximately 20 countries, have facilities in Metro Orlando.

Orlando has the 7th-largest research park in the country, [[Central Florida Research Park]], with over {{convert|1025|acre|km2}}. It is home to over 120 companies, employs more than 8,500 people, and is the hub of the nation's military simulation and training programs. Near the end of each year, the [[Orange County Convention Center]] hosts the world's largest modeling and simulation conference: [[Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference|Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference (I/ITSEC)]]. Metro Orlando is home to the simulation procurement commands for the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard.

[[Lockheed Martin]] has a large manufacturing facility for missile systems, aeronautical craft and related high-tech research. Other notable engineering firms have offices or labs in Metro Orlando: KDF, [[General Dynamics]], [[Harris Corporation|Harris]], [[Mitsubishi|Mitsubishi Power Systems]], [[Siemens]], [[Veritas Technologies|Veritas]]/[[NortonLifeLock|Symantec]], multiple [[United States Air Force]] facilities, [[Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division]], [[Delta Connection]] Academy, [[Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University]], [[General Electric]], [[Air Force Agency for Modeling and Simulation]], U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), [[United States Army Research, Development and Engineering Command]], [[United States Army Simulation and Training Technology Center]], [[AT&T]], [[Boeing]], CAE Systems Flight and Simulation Training, [[Hewlett-Packard]], Institute for Simulation and Training, [[National Center for Simulation]], [[Northrop Grumman]] and [[Raytheon]].

Now the land has been converted into the Baldwin Park development. Numerous office complexes for large corporations have popped up along the [[Interstate 4]] corridor north of Orlando, especially in [[Maitland, Florida|Maitland]], [[Lake Mary, Florida|Lake Mary]] and [[Heathrow, Florida|Heathrow]].

Orlando is close enough to [[Patrick Space Force Base]], [[Cape Canaveral Space Force Station]], and [[Kennedy Space Center]] for residents to commute to work from the city's suburbs. It also allows easy access to [[Port Canaveral]], a [[cruise ship]] terminal.

Orlando is the home base of [[Darden Restaurants]], the parent company of [[Olive Garden]] and [[LongHorn Steakhouse]], and the largest operator of casual dining restaurants in the world by revenue. In September 2009 it moved to a new headquarters and central distribution facility.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/orl-darden-headquarters-orlando-opens-092609,0,4594693.story |title=Darden headquarters to open Wednesday in Orlando |work=Orlando Sentinel |date=September 26, 2009 |access-date=November 17, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211231926/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/orl-darden-headquarters-orlando-opens-092609,0,4594693.story |archive-date=February 11, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Former Darden Restaurants subsidiary [[Red Lobster]] is based in [[Downtown Orlando]].

===Film, television, and entertainment===

Another important sector is the film, television, and electronic gaming industries, aided by the presence of [[Universal Studios Florida|Universal Studios]], [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]], [[Full Sail Real World Education|Full Sail University]], [[University of Central Florida College of Arts and Humanities|UCF College of Arts and Humanities]], the [[Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy]], and other entertainment companies and schools. The U.S. [[Institute for Simulation and Training|modeling, simulation, and training]] (MS&T) industry is centered on the Orlando region as well, with a particularly strong presence in the [[Central Florida Research Park]] adjacent to [[University of Central Florida]] (UCF). Nearby Maitland is the home of Tiburon, a division of the video game company [[Electronic Arts]]. Tiburon Entertainment was acquired by EA in 1998 after years of partnership, particularly in the [[Madden NFL]] series and [[NCAA Football series]] of video games. Nearby [[Full Sail University]], located in [[Winter Park, Florida|Winter Park]], draws new-media students in the areas of video game design, film, show production, and computer animation, among others, its graduates spawning several start-ups in these fields in the Orlando area.

===Housing and employment===

Historically, the unemployment rate in Greater Orlando was low, which resulted in growth that led to [[urban sprawl]] in the surrounding area and, in combination with the [[United States housing bubble]], to a large increase in home prices. Metro Orlando's unemployment rate in June 2010 was 11.1 percent, was 11.4 percent in April 2010, and was about 10 percent in about the same time of year in 2009.<ref>Stratton, Jim.

===Tourism===

{{See also|List of amusement parks in Central Florida|List of Orlando, Florida attractions}}
[[File:Cinderella Castle October 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cinderella Castle]] at the [[Magic Kingdom]], [[Walt Disney World]]]] One of the main driving forces in Orlando's economy is its tourism industry and the city is one of the leading tourism destinations in the world. Nicknamed the 'Theme Park Capital of the World', the Orlando area is home to [[Walt Disney World]], [[Universal Orlando]], [[SeaWorld Orlando]], [[Legoland Florida]] and [[Fun Spot America]] Theme Parks. A record 75&nbsp;million visitors came to the Orlando region in 2018, making it the top tourist destination in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|last=Santana|first=Marco|title=Surge in Latin American visitors push Visit Orlando tourism to record in 2018|work=Orlando Sentinel|date=May 9, 2019|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/os-bz-visit-orlando-attendance-numbers-20190509-7h4lodd7cffhnh6r6xmw7hbnw4-story.html|access-date=May 19, 2019}}</ref>

Orlando attractions also appeal to many locals who want to enjoy themselves close to home.

The convention industry is also critical to the region's economy. The [[Orange County Convention Center]], expanded in 2004 to over {{convert|2|e6ft2|m2|spell=in}} of exhibition space, is now the second-largest convention complex in terms of space in the United States, trailing only [[McCormick Place]] in Chicago.

==Culture==

===Film===

In the mid-to-late 1990s, Orlando was known as "Hollywood East" because of numerous film production studios in the area, although such activity has slowed down considerably into the 2000s. Perhaps the most famous film-making moment in the city's history occurred with the implosion of Orlando's previous City Hall for the movie ''[[Lethal Weapon 3]]''. The same year, Orlando native [[Wesley Snipes]] starred in the film ''[[Passenger 57]]'', which was shot predominantly in his hometown. For the next decade, Orlando was production center for television shows, direct-to-video productions, and commercial production.<ref>"What Happened to Hollywood East?"

The [[Florida Film Festival]], which takes place in venues throughout the area, is one of the most respected regional film festivals in the country and attracts budding filmmakers from around the world. Orlando's [[indie film]] scene has been active since Haxan Film's ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' (1999) and a few years later with [[Charlize Theron]] winning her [[Academy Award]] for ''[[Monster (2003 film)|Monster]]'' (2003). A Florida state film incentive has also helped increase the number of films being produced in Orlando and the rest of the state.

===Theater and performing arts===
[[File:Dr. Phillips Center Pics 03.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts|Dr. Phillips Center]]]]
The Orlando Metropolitan Area is home to a substantial theater population.

[[File:MetroWest Village fountain.jpg|thumb|Replica of the [[Horses of Saint Mark]] in [[Venice]], Italy at the entrance of [[MetroWest (Orlando)|MetroWest]]]]
Orlando is home to numerous recording studios and producers, and as a result, contributed heavily to the [[boyband]] craze of the mid-1990s. The groups [[Backstreet Boys]], [[N Sync]], and [[O-Town]] were each formed in Orlando prior to their mainstream commercial breakthroughs. The alternative rock groups [[Matchbox Twenty]], [[Seven Mary Three]], and [[Alter Bridge]] hail from Orlando, as well as the Christian hip hop act [[Group 1 Crew]]. Orlando also has a prominent metal scene, spawning bands such as [[Death (metal band)|Death]] and [[Trivium (band)|Trivium]]. There are also [[hip hop music]], [[heavy metal music|metal]], rock music, [[reggaeton]] and Latino music scenes that have all been active within the city.

Heavy traffic is also common in the tourist district south of downtown. Rush hours (peak traffic hours) are usually weekday mornings (after 7&nbsp;am) and afternoons (after 4&nbsp;pm). There are various traffic advisory resources available for commuters including downloading the Tele-Traffic App (available for [[iPhone]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]), dialing [[5-1-1]] (a free automated traffic advisory system provided by the [[Florida Department of Transportation]], available by dialing 511), visiting the Florida 511 Web site, listening to traffic reports on major radio stations, and reading electronic traffic advisory displays (also called [[Variable-message signs]], information is also provided by [[FDOT]]) on the major highways and roadways.

====Major highways====

[[File:Orlando, Florida - Downtown from I-4 East.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Interstate 4|I-4]] eastbound approaching Downtown Orlando]]
* [[File:I-4.svg|25x20px]] [[Interstate 4]] is Orlando's primary interstate highway. Orlando is the second-largest city served by only one interstate, surpassed only by [[Austin, Texas]], and is the largest metropolitan area in the US serviced by a single interstate. The interstate begins in [[Tampa, Florida]], and travels northeast across the midsection of the state directly through Orlando, ending in [[Daytona Beach]]. As a key connector to Orlando's suburbs, downtown, area attractions, and both coasts, I-4 commonly experiences heavy traffic and congestion. I-4 is also known as State Road 400.
* [[File:Toll Florida 408.svg|20px]] [[Florida State Road 408|East-West Expressway]] (Toll 408) is a major east–west highway managed by the [[Central Florida Expressway Authority]]. The highway intersects with I-4 in [[Downtown Orlando]], providing a key artery for residents commuting from eastern and western suburbs including the [[University of Central Florida]] and Waterford Lakes area. The highway also intersects with the [[Florida State Road 417|Central Florida Greeneway]] (Toll 417) and [[Florida's Turnpike]]. By late 2006, the I-4/408 interchange had almost completed undergoing a major overhaul that creates multiple fly-over bridges and connectors to ease heavy traffic. The agency recently{{When|date=February 2012}} finished construction of lane expansions, new toll plazas, and sound barriers along the roadway, though much work remains to be done.
* [[File:Toll Florida 528.svg|20px]] [[Florida State Road 528|Beachline Expressway]] (Toll 528) provides key access to the [[Orlando International Airport]] and serves as a gateway to the Atlantic coast, specifically [[Cocoa Beach]] and Cape Canaveral.
* [[File:Toll Florida 417.svg|20px]] [[Florida State Road 417|Central Florida Greeneway]] (Toll 417) is a key highway for East Orlando, the highway is also managed by the [[Central Florida Expressway Authority]] and serves as Orlando's eastern beltway. The highway intersects with the [[Florida State Road 408|East-West Expressway]] (Toll 408), the [[Florida State Road 528|Beachline Expressway]] (Toll 528), and begins and ends on Interstate 4.
* [[File:Toll Florida 429.svg|20px]] [[Florida State Road 429|Daniel Webster Western Beltway]] (Toll 429) serves as Orlando's western beltway. It is managed jointly by the Florida Turnpike and the Central Florida Expressway Authority. The highway serves as a "back entrance" to Walt Disney World from Orlando's northwestern suburbs including Apopka via [[Florida's Turnpike]].
* [[File:Toll Florida 414.svg|20px]] [[Florida State Road 414|John Land Apopka Expressway]] (Toll 414) A new east to west tollway serving northern Orlando. Phase I opened on February 14, 2009, and extends from [[U.S. Route 441 in Florida|US 441]] to [[Florida State Road 429|State Road 429]]. Phase II opened on January 19, 2013, and links SR 429 to US 441 several miles west of the former SR 429 (now renamed [[Florida State Road 451|State Road 451]]) intersection.
* [[File:Florida's Turnpike shield.svg|25x20px]] [[Florida's Turnpike]] (Toll 91) is a major highway that connects northern Florida with Orlando and terminates in Miami.

===Rail===

The Orlando area is served by one through railroad. The line, now known as the Central Florida Rail Corridor (CFRC), was previously known as the "A" line (formerly the [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad]]'s main line). The line was purchased from [[CSX Transportation]] by the State of Florida in 2013 and is now used by [[SunRail]], the Central Florida commuter rail system. Some freight spurs still exist off of the line, which are operated by the [[Florida Central Railroad (current)|Florida Central Railroad]]. [[Amtrak]] passenger service runs along CFRC. See also [[:File:Orlando area railroads.png|a map of these railroads]].

[[Amtrak]] intercity [[Passenger train|passenger rail]] service operates from the [[Orlando Health/Amtrak station|Orlando Amtrak Station]] south of downtown. The [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Revival-style]] station has been in continuous use since 1927,<ref>Mulligan, M. "Railroad Depots of Central Florida", page 42. Arcadia Publishing, 2008.</ref> first for the [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad|Atlantic Coast Line]], then the [[Seaboard Coast Line Railroad]] (signage for which is still displayed over the station's main entrance). Amtrak's ''[[Silver Meteor]]'' and ''[[Silver Star (Amtrak)|Silver Star]]'' service Orlando four times daily, twice bound for points north to [[New York Penn Station|New York City]] and twice bound for points south to [[Miami station (Amtrak)|Miami]]. Orlando also serves as a transfer hub for [[Amtrak Thruway]] bus service. Orlando Station has the highest Amtrak ridership in the state, with the exception of the ''[[Auto Train]]'' depot located in nearby [[Sanford station (Amtrak)|Sanford]].<ref>[http://www.amtrak.com/pdf/factsheets/FLORIDA09.pdf "Amtrak Fact Sheet, Fiscal Year 2009".] [http://www.amtrak.com/ ''Amtrak''].

Historically, Orlando's other major railroad stations have included:
* [[Church Street Station|Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Orlando station]] (now Church Street Station, a commercial development)
* [[Orlando (SAL station)|Seaboard Air Line Railroad Orlando station]] (Central Avenue Station; 1898–1955).

====Commuter rail====
{{update|section|date=January 2023}}
{{Main|SunRail}}
[[File:SunRail train leaving Winter Park Station.JPG|thumb|right|A southbound [[SunRail]] train leaving [[Winter Park station]]]]
In 2005, federal and state funding was granted for the establishment of [[SunRail]], a local [[commuter rail]] service, to operate on the former CSX "A" line tracks between [[DeLand, Florida|DeLand]] and [[Poinciana, Florida|Poinciana]], passing through the downtown area and surrounding urban neighborhoods along the way. The service is expected to substantially reduce traffic congestion along the I-4 corridor, especially between Downtown Orlando and the suburban communities in Seminole and Volusia Counties. Federal and state funds covered approximately 80% of the estimated $400&nbsp;million cost for track modifications and construction of stations along the route. The counties involved approved local matching funds in 2007 and the line was originally projected to begin operations in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunrail.com/ |title=A Better Way To Go |publisher=SunRail |access-date=August 2, 2014}}</ref> However, the project was ultimately voted down by Florida State Senate in 2008 and again in 2009 due to an amendment that would have approved a $200&nbsp;million insurance policy for the system. Although there had been growing concern the system would be scrapped, a deadline extension combined with a new insurance arrangement with CSX brought new hope that SunRail will be completed after all.<ref>[http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/orl-sunrail-commuter-legislature-070209,0,7151760.story]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704013658/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/orl-sunrail-commuter-legislature-070209%2C0%2C7151760.story|date=July 4, 2009}}</ref> In a special session in December 2009, the Florida Legislature approved commuter rail for Florida, which also enabled high-speed rail [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] funding. SunRail began passenger service on May 1, 2014. Phase I of the rail system runs from [[DeBary, Florida|DeBary]] to Sand Lake Road in South Orlando. Phase II, connects DeBary and continues north to [[DeLand, Florida|DeLand]], as well as extending from Sand Lake Road in Orlando south to [[Poinciana, Florida|Poinciana]]. Attempts to establish a smaller [[light rail]] service for the Orlando area were also considered at one time,{{when|date=October 2013}} but were also met with much resistance.
