==History==
===Overview===
During the [[Roman Empire]], a small settlement called ''Unica Colonia'' existed in the area of the current Oran, but this settlement disappeared as the [[Maghreb]] was conquered by a succession of regional powers, beginning with the [[Vandals]] in [[Vandal conquest of Roman Africa|435]],<ref>{{Cite book |last=Syvänne |first=Ilkka |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fHD7DwAAQBAJ&dq=435+vandals+peace&pg=PA35 |title=Military History of Late Rome 425–457 |date=19 September 2020 |publisher=Pen and Sword Military |isbn=978-1-4738-7217-2 |language=en |access-date=4 May 2023 |archive-date=4 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230504002915/https://books.google.com/books?id=fHD7DwAAQBAJ&dq=435+vandals+peace&pg=PA35 |url-status=live }}</ref> followed by the [[Berbers]] of the [[Mauro-Roman Kingdom]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wolfram |first1=Herwig |title=The Roman Empire and Its Germanic Peoples |date=November 1997 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-24490-0 |page=170 |edition=Paperback |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_7EwDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA170 |access-date=4 May 2023 |chapter=Seven - The Vandals: A Unique Case |archive-date=25 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240725012933/https://books.google.com/books?id=_7EwDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA170#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref> and finally the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Arabs]] around [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|the start of the 8th century]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Schwartz |first1=Carl |title=Mission Stations of the British Society |magazine=The Scattered Nation and Jewish Christian |date=1 March 1867 |publisher=Elliot Stock |location=London |page=76 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9_NAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22Unica+Colonia%22+Roman+%22Oran%22&pg=PA76 |access-date=3 May 2023 |archive-date=9 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231009034018/https://books.google.com/books?id=n9_NAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22Unica+Colonia%22+Roman+%22Oran%22&pg=PA76 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Spain recaptured the city in 1732. However, its value as a trading post had decreased greatly, so during the reign of King [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] the city was [[Siege of Oran (1790–1792)|recaptured]] in 1790–1792 by a coalition of Algerian troops against Spain which resulted in victory for the bey of Oran despite the many attempts in 1563. The beylik lasted until 1831 when the city fell to the [[July Monarchy|French]].

Under [[French Algeria|French rule]] during the 19th and 20th centuries, Oran was the capital of a ''[[département]]'' of the same name (number 92). In July 1940, the [[Royal Navy|British navy]] [[Destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir|shelled French warships]] in the port after they refused a British ultimatum to surrender; this action was taken to ensure the fleet would not fall into German hands, as the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] had defeated France and occupied Paris. The action increased the hatred of the Vichy regime for [[United Kingdom|Britain]] but convinced the world that the British would fight alone against [[Nazi Germany]] and its allies. The [[Vichy France|Vichy government]] held Oran during [[World War II]] until its capture by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in late 1942, during [[Operation Torch]].

Also, during French rule, Jews were encouraged to modernize and take on jobs they had not before, including agriculture, while Muslims were forced out of the city and their ancestral fertile lands were confiscated and given to Colons.<ref name="EB">{{cite web | title=Algeria - French Rule, Colonization, and Occupation in Algeria | website=Encyclopedia Britannica | date=12 Aug 1998 | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Algeria | access-date=22 Jun 2023 | archive-date=17 November 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117181437/https://www.britannica.com/place/Algeria | url-status=live }}</ref> Jews in the city were allowed to join the French Army starting October 24, 1870, while Muslims were forced to do [[military service]].

Before the [[Algerian War]] of 1954–1962, Oran had one of the highest proportions of Europeans of any city in North Africa. In July 1962, after a ceasefire and accords with France, the [[FLN (Algeria)|FLN]] entered Oran and were shot at by Europeans. A mob attacked [[pied-noir]] neighborhoods in response to the incident and during the subsequent [[Oran massacre of 1962]] at least 95 and as many as 365 were killed;<ref>Benjamin Stora, ''Algeria, 1830–2000: A Short History'' (Cornell University Press, 2004) p105</ref> many others are reported to have "disappeared."<ref name="lexpress">{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/monde/la-verite-sur-les-massacres-d-oran_460144.html|title=Algérie 1962: La vérité sur les massacres d'Oran|last=Thiolay|first=Boris|date=2006-09-13|work=[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]|access-date=12 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813004854/http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/monde/la-verite-sur-les-massacres-d-oran_460144.html|archive-date=13 August 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> This triggered a larger exodus of Europeans to France, which was already underway. Shortly after the end of the war, most of the Europeans and [[Algerian Jews]] living in Oran fled to France. In less than three months, Oran lost about half its population.<ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"/>

=== Religious history ===
[[File:Mosquée Abdallah Ibn Salam (ancienne Synagogue d'Oran) en 2011.JPG|thumb|The [[Great Synagogue of Oran]] was converted into a mosque in 1975.]]
With its location as the closest port to [[Spain]] and its prominence on the Mediterranean, Jewish refugees first immigrated to Oran to flee persecution and conversion to Christianity in Spain in 1391. This refuge brought other religious refugees that included both Jews again and Muslims in both 1492 and 1502. On October 24, 1870, with French dominance, [[History of the Jews in Algeria|Algerian Jews]] were given French citizenship with the [[Crémieux Decree]]. Later, despite a World War II sentiment that favored acceptance, Oran still had a history marked by intolerance. There was a decrease in the Jewish population as Muslims were the only group granted citizenship protection in 1963, one year after Algerian independence.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/oran-algeria|title=The Jewish Community of Oran, Algeria {{!}} Beit Hatfutsot|newspaper=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612140237/https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/oran-algeria|archive-date=2018-06-12|url-status=live}}</ref>

Toward the end of the 14th century, celebrated Arab historian [[Ibn Khaldoun]] wrote, "Oran is superior to all other cities by its trade. It's a paradise for the unhappy one. Those who arrive poor in its walls, will leave it again rich." The city excelled in the export of lead, wool, skins, fine burnous, carpets, haïks, cumin, nuts and galls.

===Spanish period (1509–1708, 1732–1792)===
[[File:20160220 130546SANTA CRUISE.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Fort Santa Cruz, Oran|Santa Cruz Fort, Oran]]. ''Santa Cruz'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "[[Christian cross|holy cross]]".]]
Before the Spaniards, the Portuguese launched a failed expedition to capture the city in July 1501. Four years later, the Spanish took [[Mers-el-Kébir]], located just {{convert|4|mi|km|0|abbr=off|order=flip|spell=on}} west of Oran. Thus began the first organized incursions against the city which, at the time, numbered 25,000 inhabitants and counted 6,000 ''fueros''. Count [[Pedro Navarro, Count of Oliveto|Pedro Navarro]], on the orders of Cardinal [[Cardinal Cisneros|Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros]], finally [[Spanish conquest of Oran (1509)|captured the city]] on May 17, 1509.

By 1554, the Turks had reached Algiers. The governor of Oran, [[Count Alcaudete]], allied himself with Moroccan Sultan [[Mohammed ash-Sheikh]] against them. Nine years later, in 1563, [[Álvaro de Bazán, 1st Marquis of Santa Cruz|Álvaro de Bazán]], Marquis de Santa Cruz, built the [[Fort Santa Cruz, Oran|fort of Santa-Cruz]], strategically placed at the top of a mountain, l'Aïdour, more than {{convert|1000|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} above the sea, directly to the west of the city. Pedro Garcerán de Borja, Grand Master of the [[Order of Montesa]], was captain of Oran when, on July 14, 1568, [[John of Austria]] (the illegitimate son of [[Charles I of Spain|Charles I]] and paternal half-brother of King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]), led a [[flotilla]] of 33 galleys against the Algerians.

In April 1669 the Spanish governor, the 6th [[Marquis of Los Vélez|Marquess of Los Vélez]], expelled all the Jews who lived in Oran and [[Mers El Kébir]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jonathan Israel |title=The Jews of Spanish Oran and Their Expulsion in 1669 |journal=Mediterranean Historical Review |volume=9 |issue=2 |date=1994 |pages=235–255|doi=10.1080/09518969408569672 }}</ref> sending them to be resettled in either [[Nice]], or [[History of the Jews in Livorno|Livorno]].

The Spanish rebuilt [[Fort Santa Cruz, Oran|Santa Cruz Fort]] to accommodate their city governors. "The fortifications of the place were composed of thick and continuous walls of over two and a half km in circumference, surmounted by strong towers spaced between them," with a central castle or ''[[kasbah]]'' where the Spanish governor had his headquarters.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Under Spanish rule, the city continued to grow, requiring enlargement of the city walls. In spite of the improved fortifications, the city was the object of repeated attacks. Notable in this regard, Moroccan Sharif [[Moulay Ismail]] tried to force his way past the defences in 1707, only to see his army decimated. In 1739, trade with the surroundings was forbidden for years due to the plague. In 1744, king [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] asked the governor Tomás du Rollet de la tour for dromedaries to replenish the stock at the [[Royal Palace of Aranjuez]]. However, the former [[bey]] of Oran had banned trade with the Spaniards and those dromedaries gradually sent to the king had been sold by thieving tribesmen. Most of the maintenance of the place was paid by the [[bull of the Crusade]], a contribution of the Spanish Catholic church.<ref name="Gómez">{{cite journal |last1=Gómez-Centurión Jiménez |first1=Carlos |title=Exóticos pero útiles: los camellos reales de Aranjuez durante el siglo XVIII |journal=Cuadernos Dieciochistas |date=2008 |issue=9 |pages=155–180 |url=https://gredos.usal.es/bitstream/handle/10366/79244/Exoticos_pero_utiles_los_camellos_reales.pdf;sequence=1 |access-date=19 July 2022 |trans-title=Exotic but Useful: The Royal Camels of Aranjuez during the 18th Century |language=es-ES |issn=1576-7914 |archive-date=25 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240725012810/https://gredos.usal.es/bitstream/handle/10366/79244/Exoticos_pero_utiles_los_camellos_reales.pdf;sequence=1 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the night after October 8, 1790, [[1790 Oran earthquake|a violent earthquake]] claimed more than 3,000 victims in less than seven minutes. [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] saw no advantage in continuing the occupation of the city, which had become increasingly expensive and perilous. He initiated discussions with the [[Dey of Algiers]].

The town of 10,000 inhabitants was still in the possession of the [[Ottoman Empire]] when a squadron under the command of captain Bourmand seized el-Kébir on December 14, 1830. The city was in a wretched state. On January 4, 1831, the French commanded by General [[Charles-Marie Denys de Damrémont|Damrémont]] occupied Oran. In September 1831, [[Pierre Berthezène, Baron Berthezène|General Berthezène]] appointed Mr. Pujol as [[List of mayors of Oran|mayor]] of Oran; he had been captain of cavalry in retirement and was wounded in the right hand under the Empire.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}

In 1832, leading a force of five thousand men, the young Emir [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd al-Qadir]] attacked Oran.

In [[World War II]], Oran was one of the landing points in [[Operation Torch]], the first American action in the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Europe-North Africa theatre]] in November 1942. The Task Force suffered some damage to its fleet, trying to land in shallow water, but the enemy ships were sunk or driven off, and Oran surrendered after heavy fire from British battleships.<ref name="R&C">Rohwer & Hummelchen 1992 p. 175.</ref>

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Oran features a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''BSh''). Oran's climate does show influences of a [[Mediterranean climate]]; however, the combination of the city's relatively high average annual temperature and relatively low annual precipitation precludes it from falling under that climate category. Oran averages {{convert|326|mm|0|abbr=on}} of precipitation annually, the bulk of which falls between November and May. Summers are the warmest times of the year, with average high temperatures in the warmest month (August) approaching 32 degrees Celsius. Winters are the coolest times of the year in Oran, with high temperatures in the coolest month (January) at around 17 degrees Celsius.

== Earthquakes ==
{{further|List of earthquakes in Algeria}}

As Oran is located in Northern Algeria, it faces the threat of earthquakes that can cause damage. However, the last major earthquake was in 1790; 3,000 people died as a result. Many of the existing older buildings in the city have been reinforced, and newer construction is designed to withstand earthquakes. While the city dates back to the 900s, the oldest remaining buildings are from the French period in the 1800s making it easier to reinforce these buildings.<ref>{{Cite conference |url= http://www.iitk.ac.in/nicee/wcee/article/WCEE2012_2310.pdf |title=Classification of Buildings of Oran City (Algeria) Based on Their Seismic Vulnerability| first1= A. |last1= Senouci| first2= M.

[[File:DiscoMaghrebOran RomanDeckertJuliaJoerin01012017.jpg|thumb|"Disco Maghreb" in Oran, 2017]]

The folk music [[Raï]] ("opinion" in Arabic), had its beginnings in Oran. This genre of music was formulated by shepherds in the 1930s through Arab and European influences. This music was surrounded by controversy due to women's key role in public performances of the music, as well as the hedonistic lyrics about love and alcohol. This led to strict governmental control in the area which led to arrests, injuries, and assassinations.<ref>{{Cite book|first= Gross |last= Joan |title= "Arab Noise and Ramadan Nights: Rai, Rap and Franco-Maghrebi Identities" The Anthology of Globalization: A Reader|editor= Jonathan Xavier and Renato Rosaldo |place= Oxford |publisher= Blackwell|year= 2002}}</ref> Many notable Raï musicians (including [[Cheb Hasni]], [[Khaled (musician)|Cheb Khaled]], and [[Rachid Taha]]) hail from Oran.
