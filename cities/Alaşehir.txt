'''Alaşehir''' ({{IPA|tr|aˈɫaʃehiɾ}}) is a municipality and [[Districts of Turkey|district]] of [[Manisa Province]], [[Turkey]].<ref>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx Büyükşehir İlçe Belediyesi], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory. Retrieved 12 July 2023.</ref> Its area is 971&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.harita.gov.tr/uploads/files-folder/il_ilce_alanlari.xlsx|title=İl ve İlçe Yüz ölçümleri|publisher=General Directorate of Mapping|access-date=12 July 2023}}</ref> and its population is 104,717 (2022).<ref name=tuik>{{Cite web |title=Address-based population registration system (ADNKS) results dated 31 December 2022, Favorite Reports|url=https://biruni.tuik.gov.tr/medas/?kn=95&locale=en |access-date=12 July 2023|publisher=[[TÜİK]]|language=en|format=XLS}}</ref> It is situated in the valley of the Kuzuçay ([[Cogamus]] in antiquity), at the foot of the Bozdağ Mountain ([[Mount Tmolus]] in antiquity). The town is connected to [[İzmir]] by a {{convert|105|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} railway.

Founded in [[Classical Antiquity|antiquity]] as '''Philadelphia''' ({{langx|el|Φιλαδέλφεια}}, i.e., "the city of him who loves his brother"), the town was known as such until [[Fall of Philadelphia|it was conquered]] by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1390.

Alaşehir stands on elevated ground commanding the extensive and fertile plain of the [[Gediz River]] ([[Hermus]] in antiquity), presenting an imposing appearance when seen from a distance. It has about 45 [[mosque]]s. There are small industries and a fair trade. From one of the [[mineral spring]]s comes a heavily charged water popular around Turkey.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Ala-Shehr|volume=1|page=472}}</ref>

Within Turkey, the city's name is synonymous with the dried [[Sultana (grape)|Sultana]] [[raisins]], although cultivation for the fresh fruit market, less labour-intensive than the dried fruit, has gained prominence in recent decades. As Philadelphia, Alaşehir was a highly important center in the [[Early centers of Christianity#Anatolia|Early Christian]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] periods. It remained a strong center of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] until the early 20th century,<ref>[https://www.biblicaltraining.org/library/philadelphia Philadelphia], International Standard Bible Encyclopedia (1915).</ref> and remains a [[titular see]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].<ref>{{Cite CE1913 |last=Pétridès |first=S. |wstitle=Philadelphia}}</ref>

==Name==
The Turkish name Alaşehir, which translates as "multicolored town", is first attested in the memoir of the 13th-century historian [[Ibn Bibi]].<ref name="EI3">{{EI3|last=Berger|first=Albrecht|title=Alaşehir|url=https://referenceworks-brillonline-com.wikipedialibrary.idm.oclc.org/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-3/*-COM_23462|year=2010}}</ref> The town was founded by King [[Attalus II Philadelphus]] ({{reign|159|138|era=BC}}) of [[Kingdom of Pergamon|Pergamon]] with the Greek name "Philadelphia".<ref name="EI3"/><ref name="CAH">{{Cambridge Ancient History|volume=8|last=Habicht|first=C.|chapter=The Seleucids and their rivals|page=376}}</ref> According to numismatic evidence, Philadelphia was briefly given the Latin name "Neocaesarea" during the reigns of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[List of Roman emperors|emperors]] [[Caligula]] ({{reign|37|41}}) and [[Claudius]] ({{reign|41|54}}).<ref name="BNP">{{cite encyclopedia | last =Olshausen | first =Eckhart | date = 2006| title = Philadelphia | encyclopedia = Brill's New Pauly | publisher = Brill Online | editor-last1 = Salazar | editor-first1 = Christine F. | editor-last2 = Landfester | editor-first2 = Manfred | editor-last3 = Gentry | editor-first3 = Francis G. | url =https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/philadelphia-e919510?s.num=0&s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.brill-s-new-pauly&s.q=philadelphia }}</ref> The town reverted to its original name Philadelphia after Claudius, but under Emperor [[Vespasian]] ({{reign|69|79}}), the town used the Latin appellation ''Flavia'' to honor [[Flavian dynasty|the imperial house]] (i.e. "Flavia Philadelphia").<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brent |first1=Allen |title=The Imperial Cult and the Development of Church: Order Concepts and Images of Authority in Paganism and Early Christianity Before the Age of Cyprian |date=1999 |publisher=Brill |page=188}}</ref> The town remained known as Philadelphia until the Ottoman [[Fall of Philadelphia|conquest]] in 1390.<ref>{{EI2|title=Ala S̲h̲ehir|url=https://referenceworks-brillonline-com.wikipedialibrary.idm.oclc.org/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/ala-shehir-SIM_0492?s.num=0&s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.encyclopaedia-of-islam-2&s.q=ala+shehir|page=346|volume=1}}</ref>

==Geography==
Philadelphia was historically located in [[Lydia]] near the northeast foot of [[Mount Tmolus]] (modern-day Bozdağ) in the rich valley of the Cogamis river, which was a southern tributary of the [[Gediz River|Hermus River]] (modern-day Gediz).<ref name="CAH"/><ref name="BNP"/> It was located in southern [[Katakekaumene|Catacecaumene]], on the road connecting [[Sardis]] and [[Laodicea on the Lycus|Laodicea]]. Philadelphia was well known for its vulnerability to earthquakes.<ref name="BNP"/>

==History==
[[File:Alaşehir Church of St. John 2.jpg|290px|thumb|Church of St John, Philadelphia (Alaşehir)]]Ancient episcopal sees of the late Roman province of Lydia are listed in the ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'' as [[titular see]]s:<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), "Sedi titolari", pp. 819-1013</ref>

===Ancient Philadelphia===
Alaşehir began as perhaps one of the first ancient cities with the name Philadelphia. It was established in 189 BC by King [[Eumenes II]] of [[Pergamon]] (197–160 BC). [[Eumenes II]] named the city for the love of his brother, who would be his successor, [[Attalus II]] (159–138 BC), whose loyalty earned him the nickname, "Philadelphos", literally meaning "one who loves his brother". The city is perhaps best known as the site of one of the [[seven churches of Asia]] in the [[Book of Revelation]].<ref name=":2">{{bibleverse||Revelation|1:11|KJV}}</ref>

Lacking an heir, [[Attalus III|Attalus III Philometer]], the last of the [[Attalid dynasty|Attalid kings of Pergamum]], bequeathed his kingdom, including Philadelphia, to his [[Roman Empire|Roman]] allies when he died in 133 BC. Rome established the province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] in 129 BC by combining [[Ionia]] and the former [[Kingdom of Pergamon]].<ref>{{cite DGRG|title=Asia|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:entry=asia-geo02}}</ref>

===Roman Philadelphia===
Philadelphia was in the administrative district of [[Sardis]] (Pliny NH 5.111). In AD 17, the city suffered badly in [[AD 17 Lydia earthquake|an earthquake]], and [[Roman Emperor]] [[Tiberius]] relieved it of having to pay taxes (Tacitus ''Annales'' 2.47, cf. Strabo 12.8.18, 13.4.10, John Lydus ''de mensibus'' 4.115). In response, the city granted honors to Tiberius. Evidence from coinage reveals that [[Caligula]] helped the city; under [[Vespasian]], Philadelphia received his cognomen, Flavia. Under [[Caracalla]], Philadelphia housed an imperial cult. Its coins bore the word ''Neokoron'' (literally, "temple-sweeper", caretaker of the temple). A small theatre, located at the northern edge of Toptepe Hill, is all that remains of Roman Philadelphia.
[[File:Carved stone slab 02.JPG|thumb|left|St. Jean Church, carved stone slab lying on the floor in Alaşehir]]

===Philadelphia in the Book of Revelation===
Although several ancient cities bore the name of Philadelphia,<ref>[[William Mitchell Ramsay|W. M. Ramsay]], ''The Letters to the Seven Churches of Asia'' (1904), p. 391-412.</ref> it is generally agreed to be the one listed among the [[Seven churches of Asia|seven churches]] written to by [[John of Patmos|John]] in the [[Book of Revelation]].<ref>{{bibleverse||Revelation|1:11|NKJV}}</ref> Philadelphia is listed as the sixth church of the seven. A letter specifically addressed to the Philadelphian church is recorded in {{bibleverse||Revelation|3:7-13}}
({{bibleverse||Revelation|3:9|NKJV}}). The city's history of [[earthquake]]s may lie behind the reference to making her church "a pillar in the temple" ({{bibleverse||Revelation|3:12|NKJV}}).{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Aside from the fact that [[Smyrna]] was warned of [[temptation]] lasting "ten days", and Philadelphia was promised a total exemption, or preservation, from temptation, Philadelphia shares with Smyrna the distinction of receiving nothing but praise from [[Christ]]. That explains why modern [[Protestant]] churches sometimes use "Philadelphia" as a component in the local church's name as a way of emphasizing its faithfulness.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Philadelphia in Patristic literature===
Philadelphia remained a major Christian center also after the New Testament period. One of [[Ignatius of Antioch]]'s [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Philadelphians|epistles in early 2nd century was addressed to the Christians of that city]].

===Byzantine Philadelphia===
Philadelphia was a prosperous Byzantine city that was called the "little [[Athens]]" in the 6th century AD because of its festivals and temples.<ref>Lydus de mensibus 4.58</ref> Presumably, that indicates that the city was not entirely converted to [[Christianity]]. [[Montanism#History|Ammia]], the Christian prophetess, was from Philadelphia, however.<ref>[[Eusebius]], ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'' 5.17.</ref>  In about 600, the domed Basilica of St. John was built, remains of which are the main archaeological attraction in the modern city. The Byzantine walls that once surrounded the city have all but crumbled away. A few remnants are still visible at the northeast edge of town, near the bus stand. The city was taken by the Seljuk Turks in 1074 and 1093–1094. In 1098, during the [[First Crusade]], it was recovered by [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios I]]. In the 11th to the 15th centuries AD, it was the seat of the ''doux'' (governor) and ''[[stratopedarches]]'' (military commander) of the [[Thrakesion]] theme.

It was the centre of several revolts against ruling Byzantine emperors: in 1182, led by [[John Komnenos Vatatzes]], and 1188–1205 or 1206, led by [[Theodore Mangaphas]], a local Philadelphian, against [[Isaac II Angelos]]. At that time, the bishopric of Philadelphia was promoted to [[Metropolis of Philadelphia|metropolis]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Kiminas|first=Demetrius|title=The Ecumenical Patriarchate|year=2009|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|isbn=9781434458766|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QLWqXrW2X-8C&pg=PA89 |page=89}}</ref> In the 14th century, Philadelphia was made the metropolis of Lydia by the Greek Orthodox patriarch of Constantinople, a status that it still holds. It was granted this honour because the city did not capitulate to the Ottomans. The city was prosperous especially in the 13th and 14th centuries: there was a Genoese trading colony, and the city was an important producer of leather goods and red-dyed silk (whence, perhaps, its Turkish name, which probably means "red city").<ref>I. Beldiceanu-Steinherr, "Notes pour l'histoire d'Alaşehir (Philadelphie) au XIVe siècle." In H. Ahrweiler, 1984, ''Philadelphie et autres études. Byzantina Sorbonensia 4''. Centre de recherches d'histoire et de civilisation byzantines. Paris, p. 33</ref> By the 14th century, the city was surrounded by Ottoman emirates but maintained nominal allegiance to the Byzantine emperor. The city remained prosperous through trade and its strategic location.

Philadelphia was an independent neutral city under the influence of the Latin [[Knights of Rhodes]], when [[Fall of Philadelphia|it was taken in 1390]] by [[Bayezid I]]. Prior to Bayezid I's conquest, it was the last Byzantine Greek stronghold in Asia Minor.<ref name="EI3"/><ref name="BNP"/> Twelve years later, it was captured by [[Timur]], who built a wall with the corpses of his prisoners.<ref name="EB1911"/> Later, it passed into the rule of [[Junayd of Aydın|Junayd]] until it was ultimately captured by [[Murad II]].<ref>{{TDV İslâm Ansiklopedisi|title=ALAŞEHİR Ege bölgesinde Manisa iline bağlı ilçe merkezi.|url=https://islamansiklopedisi.org.tr/alasehir}}</ref>

===Modern period===
From 1867 until 1922, Alaşehir was part of the [[Aidin Vilayet]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1890, its population consisted of 17,000 Muslims and 4,000 Greeks according to [[Vital Cuinet]].<ref name="EI3"/> Through the end of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]], Alaşehir was severely affected by a fire that broke out. Patrick Kinross wrote, "Alaşehir was no more than a dark scorched cavity, defacing the hillside. Village after village had been reduced to an ash-heap."<ref>{{cite book |last=Kinross |first=Lord |title=Atatürk: The Rebirth of a Nation |year=1960 |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |isbn=978-0-297-82036-9 |author-link=John Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross |page=318}}</ref> It is estimated that some 3,000 people died, and 4,300 out of 4,500 buildings were destroyed in the burning of Alaşehir.<ref name="Mango, Atatürk, p. 343">Mango, ''Atatürk'', p. 343.</ref>

A suburb of [[Athens]], [[Nea Filadelfia]] ("New Philadelphia"), is named from the Greek refugees from Alaşehir (in Greek known as "Philadelphia") who settled there following the war and the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] of 1923.

The city was the site of the [[Alaşehir Congress]] in 1919.

In 1969, a [[1969 Alaşehir earthquake|magnitude 6.7]] earthquake struck the city and killed 53 people.<ref>{{cite web |title=M 6.7 - 9 km WSW of Kula, Turkey |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/iscgem811616 |website=earthquake.usgs.gov |publisher=[[U.S. Geological Survey]] |access-date=6 January 2022}}</ref>
