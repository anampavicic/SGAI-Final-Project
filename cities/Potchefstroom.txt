'''Potchefstroom''' ({{IPAc-en|local|ˈ|p|ɒ|tʃ|ɛ|f|s|t|r|ʊər|m}} {{respell|POTCH|ef|stroorm}};<ref>{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOvWU0H_t-c|access-date=17 October 2024|title=A look on the little gems in Potchefstroom, North West - YouTube|date=24 September 2018|time=0:13}}</ref> {{IPA|af|ˌpɔtʃɛfˈstruəm}}), colloquially known as '''Potch''', is an [[college town|academic city]] in the [[North West (South African province)|North West Province of South Africa]]. It hosts the [[Potchefstroom Campus]] of the [[North-West University]]. Potchefstroom is on the [[Mooi River (Vaal)|Mooirivier]] ([[Afrikaans]] for "pretty river"), roughly {{convert|120|km|0|abbr=on}} west-southwest of [[Johannesburg]] and {{convert|45|km|0|abbr=on}} east-northeast of [[Klerksdorp]].

==Etymology==
Several theories exist about the origin of the city's name. According to one theory, it originates from ''Potgieter'' + ''Chef'' + ''stroom'' (referring to [[Voortrekker]] leader and town founder [[Andries Potgieter]]; "chef" indicates the leader of the Voortrekkers, and "stroom" refers to the [[Mooi River (Vaal)|Mooi River]]).

[[Geoffrey Jenkins]] writes, "Others however, attribute the name as having come from the word 'Potscherf', meaning a shard of a broken pot, due to the cracks that appear in the soil of the Mooi River Valley during drought resembling a broken pot".<ref>Jenkins, 1971:8</ref> M. L. Fick suggests that Potchefstroom developed from the abbreviation of "Potgieterstroom" to "Potgerstroom", which became "Potchefstroom". However, this does not account for the appearance of "Potjestroom" on many documents and photographs.

The [[African National Congress]] decided to change the name of the municipality and some street names in 2006, favouring "Tlokwe" as the new name. In 2007, its name was changed from Potchefstroom Municipality to [[Tlokwe Municipality]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Potch gets a name change {{!}} IOL|url = http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/potch-gets-a-name-change-1.366232|website = IOL|access-date = 2016-02-02}}</ref> However, the city continued to use the name Potchefstroom. The Tlokwe Municipality merged with the [[Ventersdorp Local Municipality|Ventersdorp Municipality]] in 2016, forming the larger [[JB Marks Local Municipality]].

==History==
Potchefstroom, founded in 1838 by the [[Voortrekkers]], is the second-oldest European settlement in the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. The oldest European settlement is [[Klerksdorp]], about {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=on}} west. Some historians challenge this, because the first settlement was in the "upper regions of the Schoon Spruit" (believed to have been between Klerksdorp and Potchefstroom). However, Potchefstroom was the first to develop into a town.

Until 1840, the towns of Potchefstroom and [[Winburg]] and their surrounding territories were a [[Boer Republic]] known as the Republic of Winburg-Potchefstroom. Voortrekker leader [[Andries Hendrik Potgieter]] was elected as chief commandant. In October 1840, after a meeting between Potgieter, [[Andries Pretorius]] and G. R. van Rooyen, it was decided that Potchefstroom would unite with "Pieter Mouriets Burg" ([[Pietermaritzburg]]).

On 16–17 January 1852, the [[Sand River Convention]] was signed between [[Andries Pretorius]] (representing the Boers) and Major W. S. Hogge and C. M. Owen (representing Britain). According to the convention, the British government would allow the immigrant farmers north of the [[Vaal River]] to govern themselves with no interference from either side. This signalled the establishment of the ''Zuid-Afrikaanse Republiek'' (ZAR) ([[South African Republic]]). In Article 17 of the Constitution of the ZAR dated 18 February 1858 (which was accepted in Rustenburg), it was stated that "Potchefstroom, located on the Mooi River, would be the capital of the Republic and that Pretoria would be the seat of government".<ref name=Badenhorst>{{cite book|last=Badenhorst|first=Wessel J.|title=The History of Potchefstroom|year=1939|publisher=Afrikaans Press|location=Johannesburg|pages=122}}</ref> In May 1860, Potchefstroom became the "chief city" of the republic and the capital moved to [[Pretoria]].

On 16 December 1880, the [[First Boer War]] began when the Boers laid siege to the old fort, then occupied by British forces. The siege ended amicably on 23 March 1881. During the [[Second Boer War]], the British established a [[Second Boer War concentration camps|concentration camp]] in Potchefstroom for [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]] civilians, primarily women and children, who were captured in the [[Boer republics]] by British forces as part of a [[scorched earth]] campaign.

At the opening of the city hall in 1909, colonial secretary [[Jan Smuts]] was asked about the possibility of Potchefstroom becoming capital of the Union. He replied that the city stood no chance, but should aim to be South Africa's largest educational centre.<ref name="Jenkins, 1971:104">Jenkins, 1971:104</ref>
This has led to Potchefstroom's being the "city of expertise", with numerous tertiary educational institutions. It has hosted the annual late-September [[Aardklop]] Arts Festival, a predominantly-Afrikaans arts festival, since 1997.

==Population==
The Potchefstroom Municipality, which encompasses several neighbouring settlements, had a population of 128,357 in the 2007 community survey. Of these, 69.6 percent were White, 27.0 percent were Black, three percent were [[Coloureds]] and 0.4 percent were Asian. However, the city itself and surrounding suburbs have a population of 43,448, of which 69.9 percent are White, 25.4 percent are Black, 2.8 percent were Coloured and 1.3 percent were Asian.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://census2011.adrianfrith.com/place/676004|title=Potchefstroom|access-date=17 July 2018}}</ref>

[[Ken McArthur]] of Potchefstroom won a gold medal at the [[1912 Stockholm Olympics]] in the [[marathon]]. McArthur was known in his home village of North Antrim for his training routine, which consisted of racing a narrow-gauge train.

==Education==
Potchefstroom is home to five tertiary institutions, 30 other schools and a number of research bureaus and training centres, including:
*The [[North-West University]], a merged tertiary institution which was created on 1 January 2004, with campuses in Potchefstroom, [[Mafikeng]] and [[Vanderbijlpark]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nwu.ac.za|title=NWU – North-West University|website=nwu.ac.za}}</ref> The [[Potchefstroom Campus]] (formerly the [[Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education|Potchefstroomse Universiteit vir Christelike Hoër Onderwys]], founded in 1869) is the largest, and the university's head office is located there. The North-West University became one of South Africa's larger universities after the merger, with about 32,000 full-time and distance-education students.
*The Potchefstroom College of Education (originally the Normal College), which was founded in 1919. The college was originally housed in galvanised-iron buildings on the same premises as the [[Potchefstroom High School for Boys]], and moved to its present location in 1923. The College of Education was incorporated by the university on 1 January 2001.
*The Technical College Potchefstroom, founded in 1939 when the Union Education Department began "continuation classes".{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}
*The Agricultural Centre, previously known as the Experimental Farm (1902) and Agricultural College (1939), is the largest agricultural facility in one location in [[southern Africa]]. The centre houses the headquarters of the Highveld Region of the Department of Agriculture, the Grain Crops Institute, and the Agricultural College. The [[Potchefstroom Koekoek]] chicken was developed there.
*Potchefstroom Akademie, founded in 1981 by Tina Schöltz, offers tertiary education in [[somatology]], health and skincare therapy, holistic health therapies and interior design and decorating.
*Potchefstroom High School for Girls: Originally known as the Central School, it was established in 1874. Girls High was founded in 1905, when the Central School was divided into separate high schools for boys and girls.
*[[Potchefstroom High School for Boys]], established in 1874, has been at its current site since 1905.
*HTS Potchefstroom, founded in January 1903
*Potchefstroom Central Primary School, the city's only English-speaking primary school
*[[Hoër Volkskool Potchefstroom]], founded in 1927
*Laerskool President Pretorius, founded in 1897
*[[Potchefstroom Gimnasium]], founded in 1907
Public primary and high schools in Potchefstroom's townships include Boitirelo Primary School, Lesego Primary School, Boitshoko High School, Tlokwe High School and Hoerskool Ferdinand Postma

=={{anchor|Sports|Facilities}}Sports facilities==
Potchefstroom, known as the North West Province's "Home of Sport", is the provincial headquarters of 17 major sports.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The city council emphasises the establishment, maintenance and upgrading of its sports facilities, particularly to meet the sporting and recreational needs of its youth. The [[Mooi River (Vaal)|Mooi River]] and other trails add colour and variety to facilities available to residents and tourists.

Potchefstroom has hosted two World Cup-winning teams (in [[cricket]] and [[association football|football]]), and is a home away from home for international athletes and teams. At {{convert|1400|m}} altitude, it provides a good balance between altitude and quality training. The city has no large factories, and good air quality. Athletes and professional teams train at the North-West University's High Performance Institute of Sport.

Cricket is popular, with [[Senwes Park]] the home ground of the [[Highveld Lions]]. During the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]], Potchefstroom hosted matches between [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] and the [[Netherlands national cricket team|Netherlands]], Australia and [[Namibia national cricket team|Namibia]], and South Africa and [[Kenya]]. Potchefstroom co-hosted the [[2009 Cricket World Cup Qualifier]]. The [[South Africa national cricket team]] has regularly chosen Potchefstroom for off-season training and has hosted the Australian team's off-season cricket camps. During the 2003 Cricket World Cup, [[Australia national cricket team|Australia's cricket team]] chose Potchefstroom as their home base and won the tournament.

[[Rugby union|Rugby]] is arguably Potchefstroom's most popular sport. [[Olën Park]], the main rugby stadium, is primarily used for rugby union matches by the [[Leopards (rugby team)|Leopards]] in the [[Vodacom Cup]] and the first division of the [[Currie Cup]]. The stadium is also used for football matches, and has hosted the [[South Africa national under-23 soccer team|South Africa under-23 team]]. [[Jomo Cosmos F.C.|Jomo Cosmos]], a [[Premier Soccer League]], team relegated to the [[National First Division]], also uses the stadium for some matches. Profert Olën Park was named after [[Carl Ludwig Theodor Olën]], president of the [[Western Transvaal Rugby Union]] between 1922 and 1934. [[Profert]], a local fertiliser company, maintains the playing field.

The [[Absa Puk Oval]] is on the North-West University campus. The university sport grounds is known as the Fanie du Toit Sports Complex.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Sport Facilities |url = http://www.nwu.ac.za/content/nwu-puksport-facilities|website = NWU-PUK.com|access-date = 1 February 2019}}</ref> The main rugby field has hosted several Leopards games and the [[Potchefstroom Campus]]' [[Varsity Rugby#Varsity Cup|Varsity Cup]] matches.

PUC McArthur Stadium, the athletics stadium, was renovated for the fourth time in 2014. Built in 1892, it was named in honour of [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympic marathon]] gold medalist [[Ken McArthur]]. Noted local athletes include [[Godfrey Khotso Mokoena]], the silver medalist in the long jump at the 2008 Beijing [[Summer Olympic Games]], [[Hezekiél Sepeng]], [[Jorrie Muller]], [[Justine Robbeson]] and [[Ryan Diedericks]].

The visit of the [[Spain men's national football team|Spain national football team]] during the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] brought a new level of sport to Potchefstroom and the NWU. Spain, who won their inaugural [[FIFA World Cup]] title, chose Potchefstroom as their base camp. A new sports complex was built at the North-West University for the team.

==Politics==
{{see|Tlokwe Local Municipality|JB Marks Local Municipality}}
Mayor Maphetle Maphetle of the [[African National Congress]] was dismissed in late 2012 after a motion of no confidence passed, and Annette Combrink of the opposition [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] was elected mayor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citypress.co.za/Politics/News/Potch-gets-DA-mayor-after-no-confidence-motion-passed-20121122|title=Potch gets DA mayor after no confidence motion passed}}</ref> Three months later a motion of no confidence removed Combrink, and Maphetle was reinstated.<ref name="beeld.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.beeld.com/Suid-Afrika/Nuus/Combrinck-uit-burgemeester-stoel-20130226|title=Beeld}}</ref> Since then, municipal-council and mayoral elections have been keenly contested.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}
