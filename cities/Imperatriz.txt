'''Imperatriz''' is the second most populated city in the  [[Brazil]]ian state of [[Maranhão]]. The city extends along the northeastern bank of the Tocantins River and is crossed by the Belém-Brasília Highway, standing on the border with the state of [[Tocantins (state)|Tocantins]].

== Functions ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2020}}
Imperatriz is the largest commercial crossing point, energy and economic center of Maranhão, the second largest by population and as an economic, political and cultural center in the state, and has a strategic position not only useful to the state but also for the whole north of Brazil. Imperatriz is a cross between the soy production of Balsas in southern Maranhão, timber extraction on the border with Pará state, the steel produced and processed in Açailândia and family farming in the rest of the state, rice production and future potential power generation and pulp with the implementation of hydroelectricity of Estreito, the hydroelectricity of Serra Quebrada and the [[Suzano Maranhão Thermal Power Plant|Suzano Pulp and Paper factory]]. Besides these capabilities, the city is a center for mining, mainly in the reserve of Ciriaco, a neighboring region. To provide logistical support to all these activities, Imperatriz is a local wholesale and retail center for goods from the south of Maranhão, north of Tocantins, and east of Pará. For transportation, Imperatriz has the Belém-Brasília highway, the Tocantins River and the North-South and the [[Carajás Railroad]]s. In addition, the main lines of electricity transmission for Maranhão and other states pass near the city.

Today, Imperatriz is the main region that binds the southwest of Maranhão, northern of Tocantins and the southern of [[Pará]]. The history and development of Imperatriz gave it several titles including the "Gateway of the Amazon" and "Capital of Energy."

Its Catedral Nossa Senhora da Fátima, dedicated to [[Our Lady of Fátima]] is the episcopal see of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Imperatriz]].

== Economy ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2020}}
Most of the city's active labor is absorbed by the commerce and services. In spite of that, the primary and secondary sectors, specially [[agribusiness]], still play an important role in the local economy. The farming of livestock supplies local slaughterhouses, which in turn allows Imperatriz to export meat to other states in Brazil and abroad. In addition to food processing and agribusiness, construction and non-metallic mineral processing are important. The area's most important crops are soy, rice and cassava. Recently, sugar cane has become important as well. According to [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]], Imperatriz has a total of 5,657 commercial and 730 industrial enterprises.

The city is served by [[Imperatriz Airport|Prefeito Renato Moreira Airport]].
