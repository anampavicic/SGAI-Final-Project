'''Siheung''' ({{Korean|hangul=시흥|hanja=|rr=|mr=}}; {{IPA|ko|ɕi.ɣɯŋ|}}) is a [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|city]] in [[Gyeonggi Province]], [[South Korea]]. The city has a population of 511,807 people, where 508,646 are residents out of 218,846 households as of August 2021.

At the time, Siheung had a population of only 93,000. This number more than tripled in the following decade as massive suburban apartment complexes were developed. Today's Siheung city area formerly belonged to [[Incheon]] and [[Ansan]] before 1914.

Notable landmarks include the [[Oido]] island, the Soraesan mountain, Lotus theme park and the port and inlet of [[Wolgot]].

{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2020}}
There are unique educational programs of Siheung: one involves achieving an innovative education district—since Siheung is a part of Gyeonggi's ''Innovative Education District'' work, it provides many educational programs to the citizens. The city operates the ''Regional-National Linked Training Conference'' and has Village Convergence schools. For students, they provide the ''Siheung Creativity Experience School''. Visiting village teachers in primary and secondary schools can attend the ''Village-linked Creative Education Course'' (elementary school) and other various programs.

Siheung also has more educational programs linked to the local community: first being the ''Youth International Exchange Program''; Siheung has the ''From Siheung to the world! Youth Planning Training'' program in which teenagers plan and prepare schedules for their chosen countries by forming teams on their own and then go abroad for research training; then there is the ''Siheung Dream Tree, To the world! Overseas Visit Experience'' program in which children receive prior education through various subjects such as culture and art, history and embark on field trips. The ''Overseas Visit Experience'' program is based on the idea that with new friends, teenagers can learn and understand difficult subjects through various self-directed learning methods. Lastly, Siheung has a 'sister school' project, aiming to expand international exchange activities by supporting a partnership project between a school in Siheung and a foreign school. The biggest feature is that low-income families who are unable to get a chance to visit overseas due to financial difficulties are given opportunities to participate in international exchange activities. All hopeful schools in the region receive applications throughout the year.

There are also many educational supporting services including facilities for the youth.
