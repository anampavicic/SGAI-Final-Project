'''Koforidua''', also popularly known as K.dua or Koftown and now '''Kofcity''', is a city and the capital of [[Eastern Region, Ghana|Eastern Region]] of [[Ghana]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=New Juaben Assembly revokes permit for statue after family sued Paramount Chief for ordering its destruction - MyJoyOnline.com |url=https://www.myjoyonline.com/new-juaben-assembly-revokes-permit-for-statue-after-family-sued-paramount-chief-for-ordering-its-destruction/ |access-date=2021-05-17 |website=MyJoyOnline. |date=17 May 2021 |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=3 men jailed for defiling 14-year-old girl in Nkawkaw - MyJoyOnline.com |url=https://www.myjoyonline.com/3-men-jailed-for-defiling-14-year-old-girl-in-nkawkaw/ |access-date=2021-05-29 |website=MyJoyOnline. |date=28 May 2021 |language=en-US}}</ref> The city has a population of 183,727 people as of 2010.<ref name="World Gazetteer"/> The city is a blend of colonial and modern architecture.

Koforidua serves as the [[Commercial area|commercial center]] for the [[Eastern Region, Ghana|Eastern region]]. The city is home to many businesses, with the exception of heavy duty industries. The city is home to Intravenous Infusions Limited, one of the oldest pharmaceutical companies in West Africa. The recent construction of the four-lane highway road linking the [[Koforidua Technical University]] and Koforidua to [[Oyoko, Koforidua|Oyoko]] brings commerce to the city. The highway also serves as a valid alternative route to reach [[Kumasi]]. Koforidua today is a multi-ethnic city with people from various ethnic groups in Ghana calling the city their home.

On March 4, 2024, Koforidua played host to the celebration of the 67th anniversary of the independence of Ghana.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mobile.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/All-set-for-national-celebration-of-Ghana-s-67th-Independence-in-Koforidua-1920183|title=All set for national celebration of Ghana's 67th Independence in Koforidua|website=mobile.ghanaweb.com|publisher=Ghanaweb|access-date=1 June 2024}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-03-06 |title=Koforidua thrilled as Ghana marks 67 years of independence - MyJoyOnline |url=https://www.myjoyonline.com/koforidua-thrilled-as-ghana-marks-67-years-of-independence/ |access-date=2024-10-19 |website=www.myjoyonline.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Based on oral tradition, the city owes its name to an [[Akan people|Akan]] man named Kofi Ofori, who had built his hut under a huge mahogany tree. This tree provided shelter for weary farmers who were returning from their farms. Over time, it became common for the farmers to say that they were going to rest under Kofi Ofori's tree. In their local language, [[Twi]], the word for tree is 'dua'. The combination of Ofori's name and tree becomes 'Koforidua'.<ref name="explore city"/>

==History==
Koforidua was founded in 1875 by [[Akan people|Akan]] migrants from [[Asanteman]]. The completion of the Kumasi railway in 1923 saw Koforidua becoming an important road and rail junction. Koforidua is one of the country's oldest cocoa-producing centers. It is also noted today for its weekly Thursday bead market,<ref name="explore city">{{cite web|last1=Mensah|first1=Henry|title=Experience Koforidua|url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/geography/koforidua.php|website=Ghana Web|access-date=19 April 2018}}</ref> which draws bead buyers and sellers from all over the Eastern region.

The moniker "Koforidua Flowers" has firmly entrenched itself and is likely to endure, even though some older individuals have attempted to explain that the name originated from the abundant flowers spanning the stretch between Akwadum and Koforidua, as one approached the city. However, the prevailing and widely accepted perspective contradicts this.

This figurative name has been in circulation since the 1950s. As recounted by certain elderly residents of the city, the name finds its roots in the allure of the women who migrated to the city during the turn of the century for trading endeavors. Many of these women chose to make the city their permanent home, effectively becoming part of the local population. Primarily in their late teens and early twenties, they were predominantly hailing from areas like Krobo and Akyem, with a notable contingent also originating from the Kwahu mountains. Koforidua, during that era, held a significant status as a trading hub, hosting numerous lively events every week, and therefore, was home to a substantial female population.

===Legend===
According to Legend, the Obuotabiri mountain, found in New Juabeng,both north and south districts, was the home to the gods who protected the people. It was believed to be inhabited by dwarfs and thus was considered to be the soul of the area.

==Geography==
