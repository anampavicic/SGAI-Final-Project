==History==
{{Main|History of Canberra}}
{{See also|History of the Australian Capital Territory}}

=== First Nations peoples ===
The first peoples of the Canberra area include the [[Ngunnawal]], Ngunawal and [[Ngambri]] peoples.<ref name=":8" /> Other groups claiming a connection to the land include the [[Ngarigo]] (who also lived directly to the south) and the Ngambri-Guumaal.<ref name=":9" /> Neighbouring groups include the Wandandian to the east, the Walgulu also to the south, [[Gandangara people]] to the north and [[Wiradjuri]] to the north-west.

The first British settlers into the Canberra area described two clans of Ngunnawal people resident to the vicinity. The ''Canberry'' or ''Nganbra'' clan lived mostly around Sullivan's Creek and had ceremonial grounds at the base of Galambary ([[Black Mountain (Australian Capital Territory)|Black Mountain]]), while the ''Pialligo'' clan had land around what is now [[Canberra Airport]].<ref name="bluett">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2908643 |title=ABORIGINES ADVISED AINSLIE TO CHOOSE DUNTROON |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=28 |issue=3,213 |location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia |date=30 April 1954 |access-date=24 May 2022 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16374628 |title=CANBERRA BLACKS. |newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |issue=27,886 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=21 May 1927 |access-date=24 May 2022 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia }}</ref> The people living here carefully managed and cultivated the land with fire and farmed yams and hunted for food.<ref name=":7">{{Cite book |url=https://services.anu.edu.au/files/guidance/Aboriginal_Heritage_Trail2.pdf |title=Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Trail |publisher=Australian National University }}</ref>

Still today, Ngunnawal men into the present conduct ceremony on the banks of the river, Murrumbidgee River. They travel upstream as they receive their Totems and corresponding responsibilities for land management. 'Murrum' means 'Pathway' and Bidgee means 'Boss'.<ref name=":7" />

The submerged limestone caves beneath Lake Burley Griffin contained Aboriginal rock art, some of the only sites in the region.<ref name=":7" />

Galambary (Black Mountain) is an important Aboriginal meeting and business site, predominantly for men's business. According to the Ngunnawal and [[Ngambri]] people, Mt Ainslie is primarily for place of women's business. Black Mountain and Mount Ainslie are referred to as women's breasts. Galambary was also used by Ngunnawal people as an initiation site, with the mountain itself said to represent the growth of a boy into a man.<ref name=":7" />

British settlement of the area probably dates from late 1823, when a [[sheep station]] was formed on what is now the Acton Peninsula by James Cowan, the head stockman employed by [[Joshua John Moore]].{{sfn|Gillespie|1991|p=9}} Moore had received a land grant in the region in 1823 and formally applied to purchase the site on 16 December 1826. He named the property "Canberry".

Other colonists soon followed Moore's example to take up land in the region. Around 1825 [[James Ainslie (pastoralist)|James Ainslie]], working on behalf of the wealthy merchant [[Robert Campbell (1769–1846)|Robert Campbell]], arrived to establish a sheep station. He was guided to the region by a local Aboriginal girl who showed him the fine lands of her ''Pialligo'' clan.<ref name="bluett" /> The area then became the property of Campbell and it was initially named [[Pialligo, Australian Capital Territory|Pialligo]] before Campbell changed it to the Scottish title of [[Duntroon, Australian Capital Territory|Duntroon]].<ref name="selkirk" />{{sfn|Gibbney|1988|p=48}}{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1987|p=9}} Campbell and his family built a [[dairy]] on the site in 1832, now regarded as the oldest standing European building in Canberra,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nationaltrust.org.au/places/duntroon-dairy/ |title=Duntroon Dairy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.canberratracks.act.gov.au/heritage-trails/track-2-the-limestone-plains/duntroon-dairy |title=Duntroon Diary |last= |first= |date=4 August 2022 |website=www.canberratracks.act.gov.au |publisher= |access-date=7 September 2024 |quote= }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://exhibitions.cmag.com.au/dont-forget-the-milk/early-dairies-in-canberra |title=Early dairies in Canberra |website=Exhibitions }}</ref> followed by the imposing stone house that is now the officers' mess of the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dha.gov.au/publications/australian-capital-territory.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318062335/http://www.dha.gov.au/publications/australian-capital-territory.pdf |archive-date=18 March 2012 |title=The Royal Military College, Duntroon |publisher=Defence Housing Australia |page=81 |access-date=13 May 2010 }}</ref> The Campbells sponsored settlement by other farmer families to work their land, such as the Southwells of "[[Weetangera, Australian Capital Territory|Weetangera]]".{{sfn|Gibbney|1988|pp=87-95}}

[[File:Sketch of canberra.jpg|thumb|The Griffins' plan for Canberra]]
An international design competition was launched by the Department of Home Affairs on 30 April 1911, closing on 31 January 1912. The competition was boycotted by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]], the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] and their affiliated bodies throughout the British Empire because the Minister for Home Affairs [[King O'Malley]] insisted that the final decision was for him to make rather than an expert in city planning.<ref name=tom>Tom Lawrence, "The competition for the plan of Canberra", in supplement "Australia - 100 Years a Nation", ''The Canberra Times'', 1 January 2001</ref> A total of 137 valid entries were received. O'Malley appointed a three-member board to advise him but they could not reach unanimity. On 24 May 1911,{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1987|p=100}} O'Malley came down on the side of the majority of the board with the design by [[Walter Burley Griffin]] and [[Marion Mahony Griffin]] of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]], being declared the winner.{{sfn|Gillespie|1991|p=178}}{{sfn|Wigmore|1971|pp=160-166}} Second was [[Eliel Saarinen]] of Finland and third was [[Alfred Agache (architect)|Alfred Agache]] of Brazil but resident in Paris, France.<ref name=tom/> O'Malley then appointed a six-member board to advise him on the implementation of the winning design. On 25 November 1912, the board advised that it could not support the Griffins' plan in its entirety and suggested an alternative plan of its own devising. This plan ostensibly incorporated the best features of the three place-getting designs as well as of a fourth design by H. Caswell, R.C.G. Coulter and W. Scott-Griffiths of Sydney, the rights to which it had purchased. It was this composite plan that was endorsed by Parliament and given formal approval by O'Malley on 10 January 1913.<ref name=tom/> However, it was the Griffin plan which was ultimately proceeded with. In 1913, Walter Burley Griffin was appointed Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction and construction began.{{sfn|Wigmore|1971|p=63}} On 23 February, King O'Malley drove the first peg in the construction of the future capital city.

From 1920 to 1957, three bodies — successively the [[Federal Capital Advisory Committee]],{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1987|p=115}} the [[Federal Capital Commission]],{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1987|p=128}} and the [[National Capital Planning and Development Committee]] — continued to plan the further expansion of Canberra in the absence of Griffin.

The largest event in Canberra up to World War II was the 24th Meeting of [[ANZAAS]] in January 1939. ''[[The Canberra Times]]'' described it as "a signal event ... in the history of this, the world's youngest capital city". The city's accommodation was not nearly sufficient to house the 1,250 delegates and a tent city had to be set up on the banks of the Molonglo River. One of the prominent speakers was [[H. G. Wells]], who was a guest of the Governor-General [[Alexander Hore-Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie|Lord Gowrie]] for a week. This event coincided with a heatwave across south-eastern Australia during which the temperature in Canberra reached 108.5 degrees Fahrenheit (42.5 Celsius) on 11 January. On Friday, 13 January, the [[Black Friday bushfires]] caused 71 deaths in Victoria and Wells accompanied the Governor-General on his tour of areas threatened by fires.<ref>Stephen Wilks, "The visitation of 1939", ''The Canberra Times'', 29 June 2000, p. 11</ref>

The native forest in the Canberra region was almost wholly [[eucalyptus|eucalypt]] species and provided a resource for fuel and domestic purposes. By the early 1960s, logging had depleted the eucalypt, and concern about water quality led to the forests being closed. Interest in forestry began in 1915 with trials of a number of species including ''[[Pinus radiata]]'' on the slopes of Mount Stromlo. Since then, plantations have been expanded, with the benefit of reducing erosion in the Cotter catchment, and the forests are also popular recreation areas.<ref>{{Cite book |last=McLeod |first=Ron |year=2003 |title=Inquiry into the Operational Response to the January 2003 Bushfires in the ACT |url=http://www.cmd.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/113939/McLeodInquiry.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514031921/http://www.cmd.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/113939/McLeodInquiry.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 May 2013 |location=Canberra, ACT |isbn=0-642-60216-6 |publisher=Chief Minister's Department }}</ref>

Frost is common in the winter months. Snow is rare in the CBD (central business district) due to being on the [[leeward]] (eastern) side of the dividing range, but the surrounding areas get annual snowfall through winter and often the snow-capped [[Brindabella Range]] can be seen from the CBD. The last significant snowfall in the city centre was in 1968.<ref name=bom/> Canberra is often affected by [[foehn]] winds, [[Southeast Australian foehn|especially in winter and spring]], evident by its anomalously warm maxima relative to altitude.

[[File:Canberra Civic Centre-1.jpg|thumb|An aerial view of the [[Civic, Australian Capital Territory|Civic Centre]] from [[Mount Ainslie]]]]
Canberra is a [[New town|planned city]] and the inner-city area was originally designed by [[Walter Burley Griffin]], a major 20th-century American architect.{{sfn|Wigmore|1971|pp=60-63}} Within the central area of the city near Lake Burley Griffin, major roads follow a wheel-and-spoke pattern rather than a grid.{{sfn|Wigmore|1971|p=67}} Griffin's proposal had an abundance of geometric patterns, including concentric hexagonal and octagonal streets emanating from several radii.{{sfn|Wigmore|1971|p=67}} However, the outer areas of the city, built later, are not laid out geometrically.{{sfn|Universal Publishers|2007|pp=10-120}}

Lake Burley Griffin was deliberately designed so that the orientation of the components was related to various topographical landmarks in Canberra.{{sfn|National Capital Development Commission|1988|p=3}}{{sfn|Wigmore|1971|p=64}} The lakes stretch from east to west and divided the city in two; a land axis perpendicular to the central basin stretches from [[Capital Hill, Australian Capital Territory|Capital Hill]]—the eventual location of the new [[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] on a mound on the southern side—north northeast across the central basin to the northern banks along [[Anzac Parade, Canberra|Anzac Parade]] to the [[Australian War Memorial]].{{sfn|Sparke|1988|pp=1-3}} This was designed so that looking from Capital Hill, the War Memorial stood directly at the foot of [[Mount Ainslie]]. At the southwestern end of the land axis was [[Bimberi Peak]],{{sfn|Wigmore|1971|p=64}} the highest mountain in the ACT, approximately {{cvt|52|km|0}} south west of Canberra.{{sfn|Penguin Books Australia|2000|p=28}}

The straight edge of the circular segment that formed the central basin of Lake Burley Griffin was perpendicular to the land axis and designated the water axis, and it extended northwest towards [[Black Mountain (Australian Capital Territory)|Black Mountain]].{{sfn|Wigmore|1971|p=64}} A line parallel to the water axis, on the northern side of the city, was designated the municipal axis.{{sfn|National Capital Development Commission|1988|p=17}} The municipal axis became the location of [[Constitution Avenue, Canberra|Constitution Avenue]], which links [[City Hill, Canberra|City Hill]] in [[City, Australian Capital Territory|Civic Centre]] and both Market Centre and the Defence precinct on Russell Hill. [[Commonwealth Avenue, Canberra|Commonwealth Avenue]] and [[Kings Avenue, Canberra|Kings Avenue]] were to run from the southern side from Capital Hill to City Hill and Market Centre on the north respectively, and they formed the western and eastern edges of the central basin. The area enclosed by the three avenues was known as the [[Parliamentary Triangle]], and formed the centrepiece of Griffin's work.{{sfn|Wigmore|1971|p=64}}{{sfn|National Capital Development Commission|1988|p=17}}
[[File:Canberra National Arboretum with Telstra Tower, Canberra ACT.JPG|thumb|[[Black Mountain (Australian Capital Territory)|Black Mountain]] with the landmark [[Telstra Tower]] on the right and the [[National Arboretum Canberra|National Arboretum]] in the foreground]]

The Griffins assigned spiritual values to Mount Ainslie, Black Mountain, and [[Red Hill, Australian Capital Territory|Red Hill]] and originally planned to cover each of these in flowers. That way each hill would be covered with a single, primary colour which represented its spiritual value.{{sfn|Wigmore|1971|pp=64-67}} This part of their plan never came to fruition, as World War I slowed construction and planning disputes led to Griffin's dismissal by Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]] after the war ended.{{sfn|National Capital Development Commission|1988|p=4}}{{sfn|Wigmore|1971|pp=69-79}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/timeline/results.aspx?type=pm&pm=William%20Morris%20Hughes |title=Timeline Entries for William Morris Hughes |publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]] |access-date=13 May 2010 |archive-date=15 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201115023419/http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/timeline/results.aspx?type=pm |url-status=live }}</ref>

The urban areas of Canberra are organised into a hierarchy of districts, town centres, group centres, local suburbs as well as other industrial areas and villages. There are seven residential districts, each of which is divided into smaller suburbs, and most of which have a town centre which is the focus of commercial and social activities.{{sfn|Universal Publishers|2007|pp=10-60}} The districts were settled in the following chronological order:
*[[Canberra Central]], mostly settled in the 1920s and 1930s, with expansion up to the 1960s,{{sfn|Gibbney|1988|pp=110-200}} 25 suburbs
*[[Woden Valley]], first settled in 1964,{{sfn|Sparke|1988|p=180}} 12 suburbs
*[[Belconnen]], first settled in 1966,{{sfn|Sparke|1988|p=180}} 27 suburbs (2 not yet developed)
*[[Weston Creek]], settled in 1969, 8 suburbs<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wccc.com.au/Pages/aboutweston.php |title=About Weston Creek, Canberra |publisher=Weston Creek Community Council |access-date=23 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408010446/http://www.wccc.com.au/Pages/aboutweston.php |archive-date=8 April 2010 }}</ref>
*[[Tuggeranong]], settled in 1974,{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1987|p=167}} 18 suburbs
*[[Gungahlin]], settled in the early 1990s, 18 suburbs (3 not yet developed)
*[[Molonglo Valley]], development began in 2010, 13 suburbs planned.

The Canberra Central district is substantially based on Walter Burley Griffin's designs.{{sfn|Wigmore|1971|p=64}}{{sfn|National Capital Development Commission|1988|p=17}}<ref name=map/> In 1967 the then [[National Capital Development Commission]] adopted the "Y Plan" which laid out future urban development in Canberra around a series of central shopping and commercial area known as the 'town centres' linked by freeways, the layout of which roughly resembled the shape of the letter Y,{{sfn|Sparke|1988|pp=154-155}} with Tuggeranong at the base of the Y and Belconnen and Gungahlin located at the ends of the arms of the Y.{{sfn|Sparke|1988|pp=154-155}}

There is no local council or city government for the city of Canberra. The [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly]] performs the roles of both a [[city council]] for the city and a territory government for the rest of the Australian Capital Territory.<ref name="ass"/> However, the vast majority of the population of the Territory reside in Canberra and the city is therefore the primary focus of the ACT Government.

The assembly consists of 25 members elected from five districts using proportional representation. The five districts are [[Brindabella electorate|Brindabella]], [[Ginninderra electorate|Ginninderra]], [[Kurrajong electorate|Kurrajong]], [[Murrumbidgee electorate|Murrumbidgee]] and [[Yerrabi electorate|Yerrabi]], which each elect five members.<ref name="elecpage">{{cite web |title=Electorates 2016 election |date=27 April 2016 |url=http://www.elections.act.gov.au/electoral_boundaries/electorates/electorates_2016_election |publisher=Elections ACT |access-date=9 December 2016 |archive-date=3 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103212449/http://www.elections.act.gov.au/electoral_boundaries/electorates/electorates_2016_election |url-status=live }}</ref> The Chief Minister is elected by the Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and selects colleagues to serve as ministers alongside him or her in the Executive, known informally as the cabinet.<ref name="ass" />

===Media===
As Australia's capital, Canberra is the most important centre for much of Australia's political reportage and thus all the major media, including the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], the commercial television networks, and the metropolitan newspapers maintain local bureaus. News organisations are represented in the ''[[Canberra Press Gallery|press gallery]]'', a group of journalists who report on the national [[Parliament of Australia|parliament]]. [[National Press Club of Australia|The National Press Club of Australia]] in [[Barton, Australian Capital Territory|Barton]] has regular television broadcasts of its lunches at which a prominent guest, typically a politician or other public figure, delivers a speech followed by a question-and-answer session.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.npc.org.au/upcomingspeakers/speakerarchive.html |title=Speaker archive |publisher=National Press Club of Australia |access-date=13 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419074913/http://www.npc.org.au/upcomingSpeakers/speakerArchive.html |archive-date=19 April 2010 }}</ref>

There are a number of AM and FM stations broadcasting in Canberra ([[List of radio station callsigns in the Australian Capital Territory|AM/FM Listing]]). The main commercial operators are the [[Capital Radio Network]] ([[2CA]] and [[2CC]]), and [[Austereo]]/[[Australian Radio Network|ARN]] ([[104.7 (Canberra)|104.7]] and [[Mix 106.3]]). There are also several community operated stations.<br />
A DAB+ digital radio trial is also in operation, it simulcasts some of the AM/FM stations, and also provides several digital only stations ([[Digital radio in Australia#Canberra|DAB+ Trial Listing]]).

Five free-to-air television stations service Canberra:
*[[ABC Television (Australian TV network)|ABC]] Canberra ([[ABC Canberra (TV station)|ABC]])
*[[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] New South Wales ([[SBS (Australian TV channel)|SBS]])
*[[10 (Southern Cross Austereo)|Southern Cross 10]] Southern NSW & ACT ([[CTC (TV station)|CTC]]) – [[Network 10]] affiliate 
*[[Seven Network]] Southern NSW & ACT ([[CBN (Australian TV station)|CBN]]) – [[Seven Network]] owned and operated station 
*[[WIN Television]] Southern NSW & ACT ([[WIN (TV station)|WIN]]) – [[Nine Network]] affiliate

Each station broadcasts a primary channel and several [[Digital terrestrial television in Australia#Additional channels|multichannels]]. Of the three main commercial networks:
*WIN airs a half-hour local ''[[WIN News]]'' each weeknight at 6pm, produced from a newsroom in the city and broadcast from studios in [[Wollongong]].
