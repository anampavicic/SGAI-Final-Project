== Geography ==
[[File:Unye2.jpg|thumb]]
Ünye has a little port, in a bay on one of the flatter areas of the [[Black Sea]] coast. Agriculture is the basis of the local economy, in particular hazelnut growing, hazelnut trading and hazelnut processing. The town is very quiet in late-July and August when most people are in the countryside for the hazelnut harvest.

The town of Ünye provides high schools, higher education and other services to the surrounding countryside, and other industry includes a large cement factory, flour mills, local handicrafts and the port. The town has grown in recent decades, acquiring the multi-storey concrete blocks spreading along the coast, typical of so many Turkish towns. There are cafes and internet cafes popular with students. The cuisine includes the local pizza called ''[[Flatbread|pide]]''.

With its quiet spots for picnics and walking and its excellent beaches Ünye is one of the nicest holiday towns on the eastern [[Black Sea]] coast. Affordable pensions and camping facilities as well as 2- or 3-star hotels can be found in the summer season. There are summer festivals and concerts in July.

=== Climate ===
Ünye has a humid subtropical climate ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa'').<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Table 1 Overview of the Köppen-Geiger climate classes including the defining criteria. |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02549-6/tables/1 |journal=Nature: Scientific Data |language=en}}</ref> The climate is typical of the Black Sea region, warm and wet, although because the hinterland is flatter than most of the coastline Ünye has less rainfall.

== Etymology ==
The town's name has evolved from the Greek ''Oinoe'' through ''Oinaion'', ''Unieh'', ''Unie'' and ''Unia'' to the current ''Ünye''.

== History ==
The history of Ünye goes back to the [[Hittites|Hittite]] period in the 15th century BC, followed by the Kashkas, [[Scythians]], [[Milesians (Greek)|Milesians]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] and [[Ancient Roman]]/[[Byzantine]] eras. During Greco-Roman times, it was called Oenoe and was a port town of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], at the mouth of the river [[Genius (river)|Genius]].<ref>{{Cite DGRG|title=Oenoe}}</ref>

It was also ruled by [[Danishmends]] between 1086 and 1098, 1141-1144 and 1150–1157, [[Sultanate of Rum]] between 1188 and 1204, 1214-1228 and 1230–1243, [[Empire of Trebizond]] in 1204–1214, 1228–1230, 1243-1297 and 1302-1346 and Emirate of Hacıemiroğlu between 1297-1302 and 1346–1461.

During the 1290s, the Ünye fortress was built by the Trebizond emperor [[John II of Trebizond|Ioanni (II.)]].<ref>Zehiroglu, Ahmet M. ; "Trabzon Imparatorlugu" 2016 ({{ISBN|978-605-4567-52-2}}) ; p.100</ref>

In the year 1806 the [[Laz people|Laz]] attacked Ünye. This led to the town being evacuated under the guidance of Bishop Meletios and resettling in [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]].<ref>[https://pontosworld.com/index.php/history/articles/97-pontic-history-timeline-1774-1923 Pontic History Timeline 1774 - 1923]</ref>
