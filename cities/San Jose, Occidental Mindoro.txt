'''San Jose''', officially the '''Municipality of San Jose''' ({{lang-tgl|Bayan ng San Jose}}),  is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Occidental Mindoro]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 153,267{{PH census|current}}, representing a third of the provincial population, and is the largest among cities (excluding [[Puerto Princesa City]]) and municipalities in the [[Mimaropa]] region. It is also the most populous town in Occidental Mindoro.

San Jose has the province's largest commercial port and airport, the most banking, business, dining and commercial establishments in Occidental Mindoro, and has become a center of trade in the Mimaropa region.<ref name="San Jose Commerce">{{cite news|url=http://sanjoseoccidentalmindoro.com/Products.aspx|title=Products, Industries and Investment Opportunities in San Jose|access-date=November 20, 2018}}</ref> Its major local and international exports include rice, salt and processed milkfish. It was ranked 13th in "overall competitiveness" among Philippine local government units in the 2017 Cities and Municipalities Competitiveness Index (CMCI).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cmcindex.org.ph/pages/rankings/|title=Overall Most Competitive 1st to 2nd Class Municipalities|publisher=[[Department of Trade and Industry (Philippines)|Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)]]|access-date=November 20, 2018}}</ref>

In pre-colonial times, it was named Pandurucan by the indigenous Mangyans after the local river, before later renamed for its patron saint, [[Saint Joseph|St. Joseph]], the husband of Mary.

== History ==
Historical records show that in the 14th century, [[Chinese people|Chinese]] traders anchored to trade at the shores of Mangarin, the oldest settlement in the southern portion of Occidental Mindoro. Its name was derived from the word “Mandarin”, an official Chinese Palace, the remains of which can still be found in the old barrio of Mangarin. The area was once a Sinified Buddhist state called [[Ma-i]] before the Sultanate of Brunei invaded. When the Spanish took possession of the Island in the 18th century, the first site of the Presidencia was built in sitio of Sinaoga,<ref name="San Jose OM History">{{cite news|url=http://sanjoseoccidentalmindoro.com/History.aspx|title=History of the town of San Jose|author=Candelario, Rudy|access-date=November 20, 2018}}</ref><ref name= SJOMhistory>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5JuAAAAMAAJ&q=rudy+candelario|title=Philippine Studies (pp. 99, 459, 474)|publisher=[[Ateneo de Manila University Press]]|date=1991|access-date=November 20, 2018}}</ref><ref name=MindoroWW2>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-t4MAQAAMAAJ&q=rudy+candelario|title=Mindoro sa Panahon ng Digmaan, 1941-1945|author=Acebes, Rodolfo Meim|publisher=[[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]]|date=2008|isbn=9789718141083|access-date=November 20, 2018}}</ref> on the western side of Barrio Santa Teresa, now part of the municipality of [[Magsaysay]].

Archaeological evidence from caves and rockshelter sites in the island of Ilin indicate human habitation dating back thousands of years (Middle Holocene period, about 6,000 years ago).

=== Early 20th century ===
[[File:Philippine Island - Mindoro - NARA - 68156022.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of San Jose, 1931]]

On May 1, 1910,<ref>By virtue of Executive Order 31, signed by Governor General Cameroon Forbes on April 18, 1910.</ref> Pandurucan, which was renamed San Jose, became the seat of the Civil Government with Don German Ramirez as its first appointed leader up to 1915. When the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Imperial Forces]] occupied the town, Bonifacio Gomez was appointed as Mayor from 1941 to 1942, followed by Pedro Cuden, 1942–1943 and finally Isabelo Abeleda, in 1944 until 1946. During the American reoccupation Bibiano Gaudiel replaced Isabelo Abeleda who regained his position in 1955.

=== World War II ===
{{stack|float=right|[[File:San Jose Occ Mindoro WW2 monument.jpg|upright=0.8|thumbnail|left|The Liberation Monument in the municipal park commemorating the Filipinos who fought against the Japanese forces in the Second World War]]}}

San Jose figures prominently in Philippine history for its role during [[World War II]]. American naval forces led by [[General Douglas MacArthur]] staged a so-called "Second Landing" in the beaches of San Jose (the "First" being the famous Leyte Landing) on December 15, 1944, to retake the Philippine islands from the Japanese (the [[Battle of Mindoro]]). Securing San Jose and the whole Mindoro island proved decisive in the goal to recapture Manila and Luzon, and the eventual defeat of the Japanese Imperial forces by Filipino and American troops.

=== Contemporary history ===
In 1950, the Philippine government split Mindoro into two provinces, Occidental Mindoro and Oriental Mindoro. San Jose became the temporary capital until it was later transferred to [[Mamburao]]. With encouragement from the national government, migration into Mindoro in the years after World War II boosted population growth and spurred development. The Philippine Sugar Mill plantation in the northern Barangay Central helped San Jose become the center of commerce in those years.

On April 3, 1969, the barrios of Alibog, Caguray, Calawag, Gapasan, Laste, Lourdes, Nicolas, Paclolo, Purnaga, Sibalat, and Santa Teresa was separated from San Jose to create a separate municipality known as Magsaysay.

During the 1970s, development has since shifted to what is now the poblacion area and neighboring barangays. The economic base also has widened to include rice, corn, tobacco, salt, and aquaculture production geared towards both the local Philippine and international markets.

=== Conversion into a city ===
The Municipality of San Jose passed Resolution No. 0023 in 2001, seeking conversion to city status.<ref name=res0023>{{cite web|url=https://thatallmaybeone.blogspot.com/2007/07/explanatory-note-relative-to-city-hood.html|title=Explanatory Note (Relative to City-hood of San Jose)|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|date=29 July 2007|access-date=3 October 2023}}</ref> In 2016, Congresswoman Josephine Ramirez-Sato filed House Bill No. 2164 which aims to convert San Jose into a component city.<ref name=hb2164>{{cite PH act|url=http://congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/basic_17/HB02164.pdf|format=[[PDF]]|title=Charter of the City of San Jose|chamber=HB|number=2164|author=Ramirez-Sato, Josephine|date=2016-08-01|publisher=[[Congress of the Philippines]]|accessdate=July 23, 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625052808/https://congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/basic_17/HB02164.pdf|archivedate=2017-06-25|url-status=dead}}</ref> To date, this resolution has not been acted upon or pursued by Congress of the Philippines.<ref>{{cite PH act|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/bills/house-bill-no-2164-17th-congress-republic|chamber=HB|number=2164|title=An Act Converting the Municipality of San Jose, Occidental Mindoro, Into A Component City To Be Known as City of San Jose|publisher=[[Senate of the Philippines]]|date=2022-04-20|accessdate=2023-12-02}}</ref>

San Jose is the most densely populated area in the province of Occidental Mindoro, with a 2.38% annual growth. Out of the total population of 143,430 people, about 42% reside in urban area while 58% are situated in rural barangays. The majority of the population consists of a mix of migrants of different ethnolinguistic groups from nearby provinces, namely: Tagalogs,  Bicolanos, Visayans, Kapampangans, Pangasinans and Ilocanos. Some 2% of its population belong to the indigenous [[Mangyan peoples]], primarily the Hanunuo and Buhid tribes.

Average household size is recorded at 5 with an [[urban density]] of 6500 persons per km<sup>2</sup>. About 69% are dependents, resulting to a [[dependency ratio]] of 1:2. On the other hand, male-female ratio is computed at 108:100.

Tagalog is the most spoken language and 83.97% are practicing [[Roman Catholicism]], pastorally served since 1983 by the [[Roman Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of San Jose in Mindoro]], with its own titular church, the [[St. Joseph Cathedral (San Jose, Occidental Mindoro)|St. Joseph the Worker Cathedral]].

The municipality has diverse economic activities. However, the majority of the working force which is estimated at 76%, are still engaged in agriculture. Like the rest of the province, other industries in San Jose are tied to the town's agricultural base. A substantial majority of palay and rice of Occidental Mindoro, a major supplier of rice for Manila and elsewhere, are delivered, milled, traded and sold in San Jose.

Other major agricultural products include corn, garlic, onions, and root crops. Aquaculture is well-developed in San Jose which is known for its export quality lapu-lapu, bangus (milkfish), and sugpo (prawn). The town has abundant coastal and marine resources which provide an ample supply of fish and marine products for local consumption and exports.

Commercial livestock and poultry farms producing layers, broilers and meat products also exist. San Jose has a large number of agricultural support facilities such as rice mills, warehouses, solar dryers, and the like.

Registered commercial establishments number more than a thousand, and the public market, the center of commercial activities, is the largest in the province of Occidental Mindoro. Major fast food chains and local restaurants serve residents and tourists alike, while retail shopping centers such as San Jose Town Mall offer shopping conveniences. Pharmacies and major banks can also be found in town.

Other industries include hollow blocks making, handicrafts, furniture, sweet goods and other food products ([[pasalubong]]), and other small-scale enterprises and home-based businesses.

Economic growth is likely to rise in the next decade with the influx of business interests, along with planned power and water supply improvements.
