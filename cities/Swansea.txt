'''Swansea''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|w|ɒ|n|z|i}} {{respell|SWON|zee}}; {{langx|cy|Abertawe}} {{IPA|cy|abɛrˈtawɛ|}}) is a coastal [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] and the [[List of urban areas in the United Kingdom|second-largest city]] of [[Wales]]. It forms a [[Principal areas of Wales|principal area]], officially known as the '''City and County of Swansea''' ({{langx|cy|links=no|Dinas a Sir Abertawe}}).<ref>{{cite web|title=Largest Cities in the UK|url=http://www.ukcities.co.uk/populations/|publisher=UKCities|access-date=13 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022172618/http://www.ukcities.co.uk/populations/|archive-date=22 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The city is the [[List of cities in the United Kingdom|twenty-fifth largest in the United Kingdom]]. Located along [[Swansea Bay]] in southwest Wales, with the principal area covering the [[Gower Peninsula]], it is part of the [[Swansea Bay (region)|Swansea Bay region]] and part of the [[Historic counties of Wales|historic county]] of [[Glamorgan]] and the ancient Welsh [[commote]] of Gŵyr.<ref>W.S.K. Thomas The History of Swansea from Rover Settlement to the Restoration. ISBS 0 86383 600 3</ref>

The principal area is the second most [[List of Welsh principal areas by population|populous local authority area]] in Wales, with an estimated population of {{UK subdivision population|GSS=W06000011}} in {{UK subdivision statistics year}}.<ref name="popstats" /> Swansea, along with [[Neath]] and [[Port Talbot]], forms the [[Swansea Urban Area]], with a population of 300,352 in 2011. It is also part of the [[Swansea Bay City Region]].

During the 19th-century industrial heyday, Swansea was the key centre of the [[Copper extraction|copper-smelting]] industry, earning the nickname ''Copperopolis''.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/576322/Swansea|title=Swansea|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=9 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122101250/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/576322/Swansea|archive-date=22 January 2009|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Hughes, S.

== Etymologies ==
The [[Welsh toponymy|Welsh name]], ''Abertawe'', translates as ''"mouth/estuary of the [[River Tawe|Tawe]]",'' and this name was likely used for the area before a settlement was established. The first written record of the Welsh name for the town itself dates from 1150 and appears in the form ''Aper Tyui''.<ref>See Place-Names in Glamorgan, Gwynedd O. Pierce, p 182.</ref>

The name ''Swansea'', pronounced {{IPA|/ˈswɒnzi/}} (Swans-ee, not 
Swan-sea), is derived from the [[Old Norse]] name of the original [[Viking]] trading post that was founded by King [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] ({{Circa|960}}–1014).<ref name="William2010">{{cite book|author= David William|title= Life in the United Kingdom: The Land and the People|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Rx3ATOg_MSoC&pg=PA247|date= October 2010|publisher= Intercontinental Books|isbn= 978-9987-16-017-4|page= 247}}</ref><ref name="Fraser1952">{{cite book|author= Maxwell Fraser|title= Wales|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=W1sKAQAAMAAJ|year= 1952|publisher= Hale|page= 286}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|editor= Glanmor Williams |title= Swansea, An Illustrated History |publisher= Christopher Davies |date= 26 July 2007|isbn= 978-0-7154-0714-1}}</ref> It was the name of the king, 'Svein' or 'Sweyn', with the suffix of '-ey' ("island"), referring either to a bank of the river at its mouth or to an area of raised ground in marshland.<ref>Wyn Owen, H. and Morgan, R.

===Ancient history===
The area around Swansea has a unique [[Archaeology|archaeological history]] dating back to the [[Palaeolithic]].

===Medieval Swansea===
The area that would become Swansea was known as the [[Cantref]] Eginog in ancient times, located on the eastern edge of the [[cwmwd]] (commote) of Gwyr, the easternmost cantref of [[Ystrad Tywi]]. This area was noted for its valuable land and was highly contested by the early Welsh kingdoms. During the [[Viking Age]], the mouth of the Tawe became a focus for trade, and a trade post may have been founded sometime between the 9th and 11th centuries.

The settlement remained under Welsh control until the [[Norman Invasion of Wales]], when [[Iestyn ap Gwrgant]] ceded the settlement as part of the new [[Gower (Lordship)|Lordship of Gower]] to [[Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick]] in the early 1100s. The Lordship included land around [[Swansea Bay]] as far as the River Tawe, the manor of Kilvey beyond the Tawe, and the peninsula itself.

In the following years, Henry built [[Swansea Castle]] {{circa|1106}}, and minted coins bearing the names ''Swensi'', ''Sweni'' and ''Svenshi'' {{circa|1140}}.<ref>"A hoard of coins found at [[Rhiwbina]] in the north of [[Cardiff]] in 1980 contained ... minted at Swansea ''c.'' 1140 and bore abbreviated forms of the name: SWENSI, SWENS, SVEN, SWENI, SVENSHI." Quoted from ''Place-names in Glamorgan'', Gwynedd O. Pierce, 2002. {{ISBN|1-898937-57-5}}; pg. 182</ref> Swansea was designated chief town of the lordship and received its first [[Municipal charter|borough charter]] sometime between 1158 and 1184 from William de Newburgh, 3rd [[Earl of Warwick]].<ref name="encyclopedia">The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press 2008.</ref> This charter contains the earliest reference in English to ''Sweynesse'' and gave it the status of a [[borough]], granting the townsmen (called [[burgess (title)|burgess]]es) certain rights to develop the area. In 1215 [[John of England|King John]] granted a second charter, in which the name appears as ''Sweyneshe''. A town seal which is believed to date from this period names the town as ''Sweyse''.<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Swansea |volume=26 |page=183}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/GLA/Swansea/Timeline.html | title= Swansea Timeline | publisher= Genuki | year= 2007 | access-date= 29 July 2007 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070705060006/http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/GLA/Swansea/Timeline.html | archive-date= 5 July 2007 | url-status= live }}</ref> Another charter was granted in 1304.

[[File:View of the Copper-works, Swansea, Glamorganshire.jpeg|thumb|A romanticised depiction of early copper smelting works in the Lower Swansea Valley {{circa|1800}}]]

From the early 1700s to the late 1800s, Swansea was the world's leading [[Copper extraction|copper-smelting]] area.<ref>W. H. Dennis, ''100 Years of Metallurgy'' (Chicago: Aldine, 1963) 128.</ref> Numerous smelters along the River Tawe received copper and other metal ores shipped from Cornwall and Devon, as well as from North and South America, Africa, and Australia. The industry declined severely in the late 1800s, and none of the smelters are now active.

The port of Swansea initially traded in wine, hides, wool, cloth and later in coal.<ref name="encyclopedia"/> After the invention of the [[reverbatory furnace]] in the late 1600s, copper smelting could use coal rather than the more expensive charcoal. At the same time, the mines of Cornwall were increasing copper production. Swansea became the ideal place to smelt the Cornish copper ores, being close to the coalfields of South Wales and having an excellent port to receive ships carrying Cornish copper ore. Because each ton of copper ore smelted used about three tons of coal, it was more economical to ship the copper ore to Wales rather than sending the coal to Cornwall.<ref>John C. Symonds, The Mining and Smelting of Copper in England and Wales, Thesis, Coventry University, Jan. 2003, p.92.</ref>

The first copper smelter at Swansea was established in 1717, followed by many more.<ref>Robert Hunt, British Mining (London: Crosby Lockwood, 1887) 101.</ref> Once smelting was established, the smelters began receiving high-grade ore and ore concentrates from around the world. More [[coal mine]]s opened to meet demand from northeast Gower to{{clarify|date=March 2024}} [[Clyne Valley Country Park|Clyne]] and [[Llangyfelach]]. In the 1850s Swansea had more than 600 furnaces, and a fleet of 500 oceangoing ships carrying out Welsh coal and bringing back metal ore from around the world. At that time most of the copper matte produced in the United States was sent to Swansea for refining.<ref name="H. Dennis 1963">W. H. Dennis, 100 Years of Metallurgy (Chicago: Aldine, 1963) 128.</ref>

Smelters also processed arsenic, zinc, tin, and other metals. Nearby factories produced [[tinplate]] and pottery. The Swansea smelters became so adept at recovering gold and silver from complex ores that in the 1800s they received ore concentrates from the United States, for example from Arizona in the 1850s, and Colorado in the 1860s.<ref>Otis E. Young Jr., ''Western Mining'', (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1970) 143, 202.</ref>

The city expanded rapidly in the 18th and 19th centuries, and was termed "Copperopolis".<ref name="encyclopedia"/> From the late 17th century to 1801, Swansea's population grew by 500%—the first official census (in 1841) indicated that, with 6,099 inhabitants, Swansea had become significantly larger than [[Glamorgan]]'s county town, [[Cardiff]], and was the second most populous town in Wales behind [[Merthyr Tydfil]] (which had a population of 7,705). However, the census understated Swansea's true size, as much of the built-up area lay outside the contemporary boundaries of the borough; the total population was actually 10,117. Swansea's population was later overtaken by Merthyr in 1821 and by Cardiff in 1881, although in the latter year Swansea once again surpassed Merthyr.<ref name="encyclopedia"/> Much of Swansea's growth was due to migration from within and beyond Wales—in 1881 more than a third of the borough's population had been born outside Swansea and Glamorgan, and just under a quarter outside Wales.<ref>Rosser, C. and Harris, C.C. (1998) ''The Family and Social Change: A Study of Family and Kinship in a South Wales Town''. Routledge</ref>

Copper smelting at Swansea declined in the late 1800s for a number of reasons. Copper mining in Cornwall declined. The price of copper dropped from £112 in 1860 to £35 in the 1890s. In the early 1900s, mining shifted to lower-grade copper deposits in North and South America, and the lower-grade ore could not support transportation to Swansea.<ref name="H. Dennis 1963"/>
The [[Swansea and Mumbles Railway]] was built in 1804 to move limestone from the quarries of Mumbles and coal from the [[Clyne valley]] to Swansea and to the markets beyond. It carried the world's first fare-paying rail passengers on the same day the British Parliament abolished the transportation of slaves from Africa. It later moved from horse power to steam locomotion, and finally converting to electric trams, before closing in January 1960, in favour of motor buses.

===20th century===
Through the 20th century, heavy industries in the town declined, leaving the [[Lower Swansea Valley]] filled with derelict works and mounds of waste products from them. The Lower Swansea Valley Scheme (which still continues) reclaimed much of the land. The present [[Swansea Enterprise Park|Enterprise Zone]] was the result and, of the many original docks, only those outside the city continue to work as docks; North Dock is now [[Parc Tawe]] and South Dock became the [[Maritime Quarter|Marina]].
[[File:High Street Swansea the palace.png|thumb|High Street (1915)]]

In the Second World War, Swansea's industrial importance made it a target of German bombing, and much of the town centre was destroyed during the [[Swansea Blitz]] on the 19, 20 and 21 February 1941 (the 'Three Nights Blitz'<ref>{{cite web

In 1969, Swansea was granted [[city status in the United Kingdom|city status]]<ref>London Gazette, issue no. 44986, 12 December 1969</ref> to mark [[Charles III of the United Kingdom|Prince Charles]]'s investiture as the [[Prince of Wales]].

It backs onto the [[Quadrant Shopping Centre]], which opened in 1978, and the adjoining [[St. David's Shopping Centre (Swansea)|St David's Centre]] opened in 1982. Other notable modern buildings include the BT Tower (formerly the GPO tower) built around 1970, Alexandra House opened in 1976, County Hall opened in July 1982. [[Swansea Leisure Centre]] opened in 1977; it has undergone extensive refurbishment which retained elements of the original structure and re-opened in March 2008.

Swansea may be divided into four physical areas. The geology is complex, providing diverse scenery. The [[Gower Peninsula]] was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB). Apart from the southeast corner, the whole of the Gower Peninsula is within the AONB.<ref name="SwanseaGeography"/> Swansea has numerous urban and country parklands.<ref>{{cite web

To the north are the Lliw uplands which are mainly open moorland, reaching the foothills of the [[Black Mountain (range)|Black Mountain]] range. To the east is the coastal strip around [[Swansea Bay]].  Cutting through the middle from the southeast to the northwest is the urban and suburban zone stretching from the [[Swansea city centre]] to the towns of [[Gorseinon]] and [[Pontarddulais]]. The most populated areas of Swansea are [[Morriston]], [[Sketty]] and the [[Swansea city centre|city centre]]. The chief urbanised area radiates from the city centre towards the north, south and west; along the coast of Swansea Bay to [[Mumbles]]; up the Swansea Valley past [[Landore]] and Morriston to [[Clydach, Swansea|Clydach]]; over [[Townhill, Swansea|Townhill]] and [[Mayhill]] to [[Cwmbwrla]], [[Penlan]], [[Treboeth]] and [[Fforestfach]]; through [[Uplands, Swansea|Uplands]], [[Sketty]], [[Killay, Swansea|Killay]] to [[Dunvant]]; and east of the river from [[St. Thomas, Swansea|St. Thomas]] to [[Bonymaen]], [[Llansamlet]] and [[Birchgrove, Swansea|Birchgrove]]. A second urbanised area is focused on a triangle defined by [[Gowerton]], [[Gorseinon]] and [[Loughor]] along with the satellite communities of [[Penllergaer]] and [[Pontarddulais]]. About three-quarters of Swansea is on the coast—the [[River Loughor|Loughor Estuary]], Swansea Bay and the [[Bristol Channel]].

The geology of the Gower Peninsula ranges from [[Carboniferous Limestone]] cliffs along its southern edge from Mumbles to [[Rhossili|Worm's Head]] and the salt-marshes and dune systems of the [[Loughor estuary]] to the north. The eastern, southern and western coasts of the peninsula are lined with numerous sandy beaches both wide and small, separated by steep cliffs. The [[South Wales Coalfield]] reaches the coast in the Swansea area. This had a great bearing on the development of the city of Swansea and other nearby towns such as Morriston. The inland area is covered by large swathes of grassland common overlooked by [[sandstone]] [[Heath (habitat)|heath]] [[ridge]]s including the prominent [[Cefn Bryn]]. The traditional agricultural landscape consists of a patchwork of fields characterised by walls, stone-faced banks and hedgerows. Valleys cut through the peninsula and contain rich [[deciduous]] [[woodland]].<ref name="SwanseaGeography">{{cite web | url=http://www.visitswanseabay.com/media/pdf/o/j/student_info_geography_1.pdf | title=Student information&nbsp;– Swansea geography | publisher=City and County of Swansea | year=2007 | access-date=26 July 2007 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808205931/http://www.visitswanseabay.com/media/pdf/o/j/student_info_geography_1.pdf | archive-date=8 August 2007 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Much of Swansea is hilly with the main area of upland being located in the council ward of [[Mawr]]. Areas up to {{convert|185|m|ft|0}} in elevation range across the central section: [[Kilvey Hill]], [[Townhill, Swansea|Townhill]] and [[Llwynmawr, Swansea|Llwynmawr]] separate the centre of Swansea from its northern suburbs. [[Cefn Bryn]], a ridge of high land, is the backbone of the Gower Peninsula. Rhossili Down, Hardings Down and [[Llanmadoc Hill]] are up to {{convert|193|m|ft|0}} high. The highest point is located [[Penlle'r Castell]] at {{convert|374|m|ft|0}} on the northern border with [[Carmarthenshire]].

===Climate===
Swansea has a [[temperate]] [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb''). As part of a coastal region, it experiences a milder [[Climate of the United Kingdom|climate]] than inland. Swansea is exposed to rain-bearing winds from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], also cooling summer temperatures.

[[File:Swansea population pyramid 2021.svg|thumb|Population pyramid of the Swansea local authority]]
From 1804 until the 1920s, Swansea experienced continuous population growth. The 1930s and 1940s was a period of slight decline. In the 1950s and 1960s, the population grew and then fell in the 1970s. The population grew again in the 1980s only to fall again in the 1990s.

Swansea, like Wales in general, has seen many [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Non-conformist]] religious [[Christian revival|revivals]]. In 1904, [[Evan Roberts (minister)|Evan Roberts]], a miner from [[Loughor]] (Llwchwr), just outside Swansea, was the leader of what has been called one of the world's greatest [[Protestant]] religious revivals. Within a few months, about 100,000 people were converted. This revival in particular had a profound effect on Welsh society. Swansea is covered by the [[Methodist Circuit|Swansea and Gower Methodist Circuit]].

The [[Baptists|Ebenezer Baptist Church]] dates from November 1875 when the foundation stone was laid for Tabernacle chapel in Skinner Street. The first pastor, the Rev. J. D. Jones, was called in February 1876 and the new building was opened in July that year. The church was served by a number of ministers until 1911 when the Rev. R. J. Willoughby came to the church.<ref>{{cite web |date=17 January 2016 |title=More about the church&nbsp;– Ebenezer Baptist Church, Swansea |url=http://www.ebenezer.org.uk/about/more-about-the-church/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131050739/http://www.ebenezer.org.uk/about/more-about-the-church/ |archive-date=31 January 2016 |access-date=25 January 2016 |publisher=Ebenezer.org.uk}}</ref> The church has an organ by [[Harrison & Harrison]].<ref>{{youTube|LAGOu1xKfmk|The Organ of Ebenezer Baptist Church Swansea}}</ref>

The [[Norwegian Church, Swansea|Norwegian Church]] is a Grade II [[listed building]] in the [[Swansea docks|docklands]] area of the city. The church building was originally located at [[Newport Docks]]. The building consists of a [[Sailor|Seaman]]'s [[Mission (Christian)|Mission]] to the west end and a single [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] church to the east end. It was originally built as a place of worship [[Norwegian Church Abroad|for Norwegian sailors]] when they visited the UK.

Other theatres include the Dylan Thomas Theatre (formerly the Little Theatre) near the marina, and one in Penyrheol Leisure Centre near [[Gorseinon]]. In the summer, outdoor Shakespeare performances are a regular feature at [[Oystermouth Castle]], and [[Singleton Park]] is the venue for a number of parties and concerts, from dance music to outdoor [[Proms]]. A folk festival is held on Gower.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.folkmusic.net/htmfiles/festivals_000.htm | title=The Living Tradition Festival Listing, 2007 | publisher=The Living Tradition | year=2007 | access-date=26 July 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730050914/http://www.folkmusic.net/htmfiles/festivals_000.htm | archive-date=30 July 2007 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Standing near Victoria Park on the coast road is the [[Patti Pavilion]]; this was the Winter Garden from Adelina Patti's Craig-y-Nos estate in the upper Swansea valley, which she donated to the town in 1918. It is used as a venue for music shows and fairs. The [[Brangwyn Hall]] is a multi-use venue with events such as the graduation ceremonies for [[Swansea University]]. Every autumn, Swansea hosts a Festival of Music and the Arts, when international orchestras and soloists visit the Brangwyn Hall. The Brangwyn Hall is praised for its acoustics for recitals, orchestral pieces and chamber music alike.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southwest/sites/swansea/pages/brangwyn.shtml | title=Brangwyn Hall & The Empire Panels | publisher=BBC | year=2006 | access-date=27 July 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060405174517/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southwest/sites/swansea/pages/brangwyn.shtml | archive-date=5 April 2006 | url-status=live }}</ref>

Swansea is home to the [[Palace Theatre, Swansea|Palace Theatre]]. Located at 156 High Street, it is recognisable for its distinctive wedge shape. Originally built in 1888 as a traditional music hall, the building's original name was the 'Pavilion'. During its lifetime, the building has been used as a bingo hall as well as a nightclub.

In 2018 Singleton Park, Swansea was the home-city for BBC Music's 'Biggest Weekend' featuring [[Ed Sheeran]], [[Taylor Swift]], [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]], [[Florence + The Machine]] and others. Priority was given to Swansea residents in purchasing tickets for this one-off 'day festival' (over 2 days); tickets were priced at £18 a day and all 60,000 tickets (30,000 for each day) sold out almost instantly.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/tickets-swanseas-biggest-weekend-sold-14277218|title=Tickets for Swansea's Biggest Weekend sold out in minutes|author=Katie Bellis|website=WalesOnline|access-date=27 May 2018|date=12 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180527202504/https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/tickets-swanseas-biggest-weekend-sold-14277218|archive-date=27 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Festivals===
Swansea hosted the [[National Eisteddfod]] in 1863, 1891, 1907, 1926, 1964, 1982 and 2006. The 2006 event occupied the site of the former [[Felindre]] tinplate works to the north of the city and featured a strikingly pink main tent. In 2009 Swansea Council launched Wales's only week long [[St David's Week]] festival in venues throughout the city. The Beginning and Do Not Go Gentle are Festivals in the Uplands area of the city where Dylan Thomas was born and lived for 23 years.

Swansea is known for its celebration of [[Beaujolais Day]] with people booking tables in restaurants and bars for the day up to a year in advance to ensure they can sample the year's newly released Beaujolais wine.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/one-welsh-city-goes-mad-13789041 |title=Why Swansea goes mad for Beaujolais Day |last1=Rees |first1=Mark|last2=Bellis |first2=Katie |date=20 November 2019 |website=[[Walesonline]]|access-date=12 June 2021}}</ref> Historian [[Peter Stead (writer)|Peter Stead]] argues that its rise in popularity there can be traced to the city's No Sign Bar, owned in the 1960s by former [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales rugby union]] captain [[Clem Thomas]], who owned a house in Burgundy and could transport Beaujolais quickly and cheaply to south Wales, and suggests that it reflected Swansea's efforts to "gentrify and intellectualise itself" at the time. In 2015 it was estimated that Beaujolais Day contributed £5&nbsp;million to the local economy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-38000337 |title=Why is Swansea leading a Beaujolais Day revival? |last=Prior |first=Neil |date=17 November 2016 |website=[[bbc.co.uk]] |access-date=12 June 2021}}</ref>

===Welsh language===
There are many [[Welsh language]] chapels in the area. Welsh-medium education is a popular and growing choice for both English- and Welsh-speaking families. Just over 1,600 secondary pupils were educated through the medium of Welsh in 2017. Nearly double this figure, 3,063 pupils are currently educated through the medium of Welsh in the primary sector. The 2014 Swansea Pre-School survey showed that 35% of parents across the City and County of Swansea would select a Welsh education for their children if there was a local Welsh school available to them. 45% of the rural council ward [[Mawr]] are able to speak [[Welsh language|Welsh]], as can 38% of the ward of [[Pontarddulais (electoral ward)|Pontarddulais]]. [[Clydach (electoral ward)|Clydach]], [[Kingsbridge, Swansea|Kingsbridge]] and [[Upper Loughor]] all have levels of more than 20%. By contrast, the urban [[St. Thomas, Swansea|St. Thomas]] has one of the lowest figures in Wales, at 6.4%, a figure only barely lower than [[Penderry]] and [[Townhill, Swansea|Townhill]] wards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bwrdd-yr-iaith.org.uk/download.php?id=2082.6 |title=Results of the 2001 Census of Population on the Language in Electoral Wards |publisher=Welsh Language Board |year=2007 |access-date=26 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220090448/http://www.bwrdd-yr-iaith.org.uk/download.php?id=2082.6 |archive-date=20 February 2006 }}</ref>

[[File:Statue of Dylan Thomas, Swansea.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Statue of Dylan Thomas|alt=A bronze statue of Dylan Thomas in the Maritime Quarter, Swansea]]
The poet [[Dylan Thomas]] is perhaps the best-known. He was born in the town and grew up at 5 Cwmdonkin Drive, Uplands, where he lived for 23 years and produced two-thirds of his published work from his tiny bedroom which has been faithfully recreated as it may have been in 1934 and is open for house tours, events, Edwardian dinner parties and overnight stays. There is a memorial to him in the nearby [[Cwmdonkin Park]]; he described Swansea as an "ugly lovely town". In the 1930s Thomas was a member of a group of local artists, writers and musicians known as [[The Kardomah Gang]], which met in the [[Kardomah Café]] which was in Castle Street, Swansea until bombed during the Second World War.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/dylan-thomas-and-the-kardomah-set-525736.html|title=Dylan Thomas and the Kardomah set|work=The Independent|access-date=15 September 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120907032951/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/dylan-thomas-and-the-kardomah-set-525736.html|archive-date=7 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

Throughout the 19th century, the [[Vivian family (British Isles)|Vivian family]] did much to develop Swansea. Their wealth and influence came from large copper-mining, smelting and trading businesses in Swansea ([[Vivian & Sons]]), and is still visible today in their former family residences: [[Singleton Abbey]] (now used by [[Swansea University]]), [[Sketty Hall]], [[Clyne Castle]] and [[Clyne Gardens]]. [[Henry Vivian, 1st Baron Swansea|Henry Vivian]] became the first [[Baron Swansea|Lord Swansea]] in 1893.

[[Rowan Williams]], Archbishop of Canterbury, was born in Swansea. He was educated at the state-sector [[Dynevor School, Swansea]] before reading theology at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]]. [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] was born and raised in Swansea and still owns a home in Mumbles. Swansea is the home town of [[Non Stanford]], the 2013 ITU Triathlon World Champion.<ref>Non Stanford</ref> The thriller writer, [[Mark Ellis (Welsh author)|Mark Ellis]] was educated in Swansea.

[[Swansea City A.F.C.]] (founded 1912) is the city's main football association team. Originally playing at the [[Vetch Field]], they moved to the [[Swansea.com Stadium]] (then known as the Liberty Stadium) at the start of the 2005–06 season, winning promotion to League One in their final year at their old stadium. The team presently play in the [[English Championship]], after spending seven seasons in the English [[Premier League]]. The Football Association of Wales had decided that for the Euro 2012 qualifying campaign, Wales would play all of their home ties at either the [[Cardiff City Stadium]] or the Liberty Stadium.

Swansea has four association football clubs that play in the [[Welsh football league system]]: [[Swansea University F.C.]], [[Garden Village F.C.|Garden Village]], [[South Gower A.F.C.|South Gower]] and [[West End F.C.|West End]].

Swansea is home to [[Swansea RFC|Swansea Rugby Football Club]] (Swansea RFC), a founder member of the [[Welsh Rugby Union]] and one of the most important teams in the early history of Welsh [[rugby union]]. Playing out of [[St Helens Rugby and Cricket Ground]] the club not only produced several of the greatest Welsh rugby superstars, including [[Billy Bancroft]] and [[Billy Trew]], they also hosted national touring sides from Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Known as the 'All Whites', Swansea kept a constant supply of players that filled the Welsh ranks in the early history of the game. In 1935 Swansea became the first club side to beat the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]].

In 2003, [[Swansea RFC]] merged with [[Neath RFC]] to form the [[Ospreys (rugby union)|Ospreys]]. Swansea RFC remained at St Helen's in semi-professional form, but the Ospreys moved into the Liberty Stadium in Landore for the start of the 2005–06 season. Neath-Swansea rugby games used to be hotly contested matches, such that there was some debate about whether a team incorporating both areas was possible. The team came fifth in the [[Pro14|Celtic League]] in their first year of existence and topped that league in their second year. By 2012 they had won the league a then-record four times.

Swansea originally developed as centre for [[metals]] and mining, especially the copper industry, from the beginning of the 18th century. The industry reached its apogee in the 1880s, when 60% of the copper ores imported to Britain were smelted in the [[Lower Swansea valley]].<ref>Jenkins, P (1992) A History of Modern Wales 1536–1990.

===Bus and coach===
[[File:Swansea Bus Station.jpg|thumb|Swansea bus station]]
Bus routes within Swansea are operated predominantly by [[First Cymru]], while smaller bus and coach operators such as [[NAT Group]], South Wales Transport, Lewis Coaches, First Call Travel and DANSA also operate some routes in the city, most of which serve [[Swansea bus station]]. First Cymru operated the [[Swansea Metro]], a road-based [[FTR (bus)|FTR]] [[bus rapid transit]] route, introduced between [[Morriston Hospital]] and [[Singleton Hospital]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=29961|title=Swansea Metro service kicks off&nbsp;– City and County of Swansea.

First Cymru introduced the "Cymru Clipper", "Swansea & The Bay" and "Campus to Campus" liveries in 2014 and 2019 respectively with services originating from Swansea bus station. The "Cymru Clipper" operations serve several rural communities across [[South West Wales]], the "Swansea & The Bay" services operate within Swansea and [[Neath Port Talbot]] and the "Campus to Campus" services operate between the Student Village at [[Hendrefoilan]] and the [[Singleton Park]] and [[Crymlyn Burrows]] (Bay) campuses of [[Swansea University]].

Veolia used to operate the rural services around the Gower Peninsula and the Lliw Valley - branded Gower Explorer and Lliw Link respectively. Since Veolia's withdrawal from Swansea, these services were operated by First Cymru for several years, and are now operated by NAT Group.
