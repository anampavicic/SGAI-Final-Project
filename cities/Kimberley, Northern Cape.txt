'''Kimberley ''' is the [[Capital city|capital]] and largest city of the [[Northern Cape]] province of [[South Africa]]. It is located approximately 110&nbsp;km east of the confluence of the [[Vaal River|Vaal]] and [[Orange River]]s. The city has considerable historical significance due to its [[diamond]] mining past and the [[Siege of Kimberley|siege]] during the [[Second Boer War|Second Anglo-Boer war]]. British businessmen [[Cecil Rhodes]] and [[Barney Barnato]] made their fortunes in Kimberley, and Rhodes established the [[De Beers]] diamond company in the early days of the mining town.

On 2 September 1882, Kimberley was the first city in the Southern Hemisphere and the second in the world after [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] in the [[United States of America|United States]] to integrate [[electric street lights]] into its infrastructure. The first stock exchange in Africa was built in Kimberley, as early as 1881.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://afkinsider.com/35226/17-things-didnt-realize-invented-by-south-africans/17/ |title=17 Things You Didn't Know Were Invented By South Africans |date=2017-02-09 |work=AFKInsider |access-date=2017-09-09 |language=en-US}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Moresources|section|date=August 2023}}
=== Discovery of diamonds ===
In 1866, Erasmus Jacobs found a small brilliant pebble on the banks of the [[Orange River]], on the farm ''De Kalk'' leased from local [[Griqua people|Griquas]], near [[Hopetown]], which was his father's farm. He showed the pebble to his father, who then sold it.<ref name="Meredith2007" />{{rp|16}} The pebble was purchased from Jacobs' father by Schalk van Niekerk, who later sold it on again. It proved to be a {{convert|21.25|carat|g|1|adj=on|abbr=}} [[diamond]], and became known as the [[Eureka Diamond|Eureka]]. Three years later, in 1869, an {{convert|83.5|carat|g|1|adj=on}} diamond, which became known as the [[Star of South Africa (diamond)|Star of South Africa]], was found nearby ({{coord|29|3|S|23|58|E|display=inline|type:landmark_region:ZA}}).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Roberts |first1=Brian |title=The Diamond Magnates |date=1972 |publisher=Hamilton |location=London |isbn=0241021774 |page=5}}</ref><ref name="Wilson1982">{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Arthur Norman |title=Diamonds: From Birth to Eternity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x5FQAQAAIAAJ |year=1982 |publisher=Gemological Institute of America |page=135 |isbn=9780873110105}}</ref> This diamond was sold by van Niekerk for £11,200, and later resold in the London market for £25,000.<ref name="Meredith2007" />

[[File:Red Cap Party.jpg|thumb|right|Fleetwood Rawstorne's "Red Cap Party" of prospectors on Colesberg Kopje]]
Henry Richard Giddy recounted how Esau Damoense (or Damon), the cook for prospector Fleetwood Rawstorne's "Red Cap Party", found diamonds in 1871 on Colesberg Kopje after he was sent there to dig as punishment.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chilvers |first1=Henry |title=The Story of De Beers |date=1939 |publisher=Cassell |pages=23–24}}</ref> Rawstorne took the news to the nearby diggings of the De Beer brothers – his arrival there sparking off the famous "New Rush" which, as historian [[Brian Roberts (Historian)|Brian Roberts]] puts it, was practically a stampede. Within a month, 900 claims were cut into the hillock, which were worked frenetically by two to three thousand men. As the land was lowered, so the hillock became a mine – in time, the world-renowned [[Big Hole|Kimberley Mine]].<ref name="Roberts1976">{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=Brian |author-link=Brian Roberts (Historian) |title=Kimberley: Turbulent City |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ON71wM6U0ZMC |year=1976 |publisher=D.

The [[Cape Colony]], [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], [[Orange Free State]] and the [[Griqua people|Griqua]] leader [[Nicolaas Waterboer]] all laid claim to the diamond fields. The Free State [[Boers]] in particular wanted the area, as it lay inside the natural borders created by [[Orange River|Orange]] and [[Vaal River]]s. Following the mediation that was overseen by the Governor of [[Natal Colony|Natal]], the Keate Award went in favour of Waterboer, who placed himself under British protection.<ref name="Ralph1900">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/towardspretoriar00ralp |title=Towards Pretoria; a record of the war between Briton and Boer, to the relief of Kimberley |year=1900 |last=Ralph |first=Julia |publisher=Frederick A. Stokes}}</ref> Consequently, the territory known as [[Griqualand West]] was proclaimed on 27 October 1871.

===Naming the place: from Vooruitzigt to New Rush to Kimberley===
Colonial Commissioners arrived in New Rush on 17 November 1871 to exercise authority over the territory on behalf of the Cape Governor. Digger objections and minor riots led to Governor [[Henry Barkly|Barkly's]] visit to New Rush in September the following year, when he revealed a plan instead to have Griqualand West proclaimed a [[Crown Colony]]. 

[[Richard Southey (colonial administrator)|Richard Southey]] would arrive as Lieutenant-Governor of the intended Crown Colony in January 1873. Months passed however without any sign of the proclamation or of the promised new constitution and provision for representative government. The delay was in [[London]] where [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], [[John Wodehouse, 1st Earl of Kimberley]], insisted that before electoral divisions could be defined, the places had to receive "decent and intelligible names. His Lordship declined to be in any way connected with such a vulgarism as New Rush and as for the Dutch name, ''Vooruitzigt'' … he could neither spell nor pronounce it."<ref name="Roberts1976" />{{rp|115}} 

The matter was passed to Southey who gave it to his Colonial Secretary J.B. Currey. Roberts writes that "when it came to renaming New Rush, [Currey] proved himself a worthy diplomat. He made quite sure that Lord Kimberley would be able both to spell and pronounce the name of the main electoral division by, as he says, calling it 'after His Lordship'." New Rush became Kimberley, by Proclamation dated 5 July 1873.<ref name="Roberts1976" />{{rp|115}} 

Digger sentiment was expressed in an editorial in the ''Diamond Field'' newspaper when it stated "we went to sleep in New Rush and waked up in Kimberley, and so our dream was gone."<ref name="Roberts1976" />{{rp|116}}

Following agreement by the British government on compensation to the [[Orange Free State]] for its competing land claims, Griqualand West was annexed to the [[Cape Colony]] in 1877.<ref name="Ref_1918">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/selectconstitut01eybegoog |title=Select Constitutional Documents Illustrating South African History 1795-1910 |page=[https://archive.org/details/selectconstitut01eybegoog/page/n159 66] |publisher=Routledge and Sons |year=1918}}</ref> 

The Cape Prime Minister [[John Molteno]] initially had serious doubts about annexing the heavily indebted region, but, after striking a deal with the Home Government and receiving assurances that the local population would be consulted in the process, he passed the [[Griqualand West Annexation Act]] on 27 July 1877.<ref name="Roberts1976" />{{rp|155}}
[[File:Open pit mine.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Big Hole]].]]

=== Big Hole and other mines ===
{{Main|Big Hole}}
As miners arrived in their thousands the hill disappeared and subsequently became known as the [[Big Hole]] (or ''Kimberley se Gat'' in Afrikaans) or, more formally, [[Big Hole|Kimberley Mine]]. From mid-July 1871 to 1914, 50,000 miners dug the hole with picks and shovels, yielding 2,722&nbsp;kg of [[diamond]]s. The Big Hole has a surface of {{convert|17|ha|acre|abbr=off|0}} and is 463 metres wide. It was excavated to a depth of 240&nbsp;m, but then partially infilled with debris reducing its depth to about 215&nbsp;m; since then it has accumulated water to a depth of 40 m leaving 175 m visible. Beneath the surface, the Kimberley Mine underneath the Big Hole was mined to a depth of 1097&nbsp;metres. A popular local myth claims that it is the largest hand-dug hole on the world, however [[Jagersfontein Mine]] appears to hold that record.<ref name="Hannatjie2005">{{cite news |url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,6119,2-7-1442_1708011,00.html |author=Hannatjie van der Merwe |date=20 May 2005 |access-date=21 October 2008 |title=Big Hole loses claim to fame |publisher=[[News24 (website)|News24]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107014127/http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0%2C6119%2C2-7-1442_1708011%2C00.html |archive-date= 7 January 2009}}</ref>

By 1873, Kimberley was the second largest town in South Africa, having an approximate population of 40,000.<ref name="Meredith2007" />{{rp|34}}

=== Role and influence of De Beers ===
{{Main|De Beers}}
[[File:BigHole Cocopan.JPG|thumb|right|A sign next to the Big Hole, reading "If all the diamonds recovered from the Kimberley Mine could be gathered together they would fill three [[Minecart|cocopans]] such as these"]]
The various smaller mining companies were amalgamated by [[Cecil Rhodes]] and [[Charles Rudd]] into [[De Beers]], and The Kimberley under [[Barney Barnato]]. In 1888, the two companies merged to form [[De Beers|De Beers Consolidated Mines]], which once had a monopoly over the world's diamond market.<ref>{{cite web |title=Anglo American: De Beers investor presentation |url=http://www.angloamerican.com/~/media/Files/A/Anglo-American-PLC-V2/presentations/2014pres/de-beers-analyst-seminar-presentation.pdf |website=Anglo American |access-date=19 February 2015}}</ref><ref name="John1974">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IdrVz9e9CzYC |title=The Autobiography of John Hays Hammond |page=205 |year=1974 |publisher=Ayer Publishing |isbn=0-405-05913-2 |author=John Hays Hammond}}</ref>

Very quickly, Kimberley became the largest city in the area, partly due to a massive African migration to the area from all over the continent. The immigrants were accepted with open arms, because the De Beers company was in search of cheap labour to help run the mines. Another group drawn to the city for money was prostitutes, from a wide variety of ethnicities who could be found in bars and saloons. It was praised as a city of limitless opportunity.<ref name="Meredith2007" />{{rp|36}}

Five big holes were dug into the earth following the [[kimberlite]] pipes, which are named after the town. Kimberlite is a diamond-bearing blue ground that sits below a yellow colored soil.<ref name="Meredith2007">{{cite book |last=Meredith |first=Martin |author-link=Martin Meredith |title=Diamonds, Gold and War: The Making of South Africa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4t6XGAAACAAJ |year=2007 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=978-0-7432-8614-5}}</ref>{{rp|34}} The largest, The Kimberley mine or "Big Hole" covering {{convert|170000|m2|acre}}, reached a depth of {{convert|240|m}} and yielded three [[ton]]s of diamonds.

{{Main|Siege of Kimberley}}
{{See also|Battle of Modder River|Battle of Magersfontein|Battle of Paardeberg}}

[[File:Kimberley-ticket.jpg|thumb|right|Soup ration ticket from the [[Siege of Kimberley]]]]
On 14 October 1899, Kimberley was besieged at the beginning of the [[Second Boer War]]. The [[United Kingdom|British]] forces trying to relieve the siege suffered heavy losses. The siege was only lifted on 15 February 1900, but the war continued until May 1902. By that time, the British had built a [[concentration camp]] at Kimberley to house [[Boer]] women and children.<ref name="Ref_1902">{{cite book |title=Sessional Papers By Great Britain Parliament |publisher=House of Commons |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7jBFAAAAMAAJ |year=1902}}</ref>

===Amalgamation===
The hitherto separately administered Boroughs of Kimberley and Beaconsfield amalgamated as the City of Kimberley in 1912.<ref name="Roberts1976" />

=== Under Apartheid ===
{{Main|Apartheid in South Africa}}
Although a considerable degree of urban segregation already existed, one of the most significant impacts of [[Apartheid]] on the city of Kimberley was the implementation of the [[Group Areas Act]]. Communities were divided according to [[Population Registration Act|legislated]] racial categories, namely European (White), Native (Black), Coloured and Indian – now legally separated by the [[Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act]]. Individual families could be split up to three ways (based on such notorious measures as the '[[Pencil test (South Africa)|pencil test]]') and mixed communities were either completely relocated (as in [[Malay Camp, Kimberley|Malay Camp]] – although those clearances began before Apartheid as such) or were selectively cleared (as in Greenpoint which became a 'Coloured' Group Area, its erstwhile African and other residents being removed to other parts of town). [[Residential segregation]] was thus enforced in a process which saw the creation of new townships at the northern and north-eastern edges of the expanding city. Institutions that were hard hit by the [[Group Areas Act]], [[Bantu Education Act|Bantu Education]] and other Acts included churches (such as the Bean Street Methodist Church) and schools (some, such as William Pescod and [[Perseverance School]], moved while the [[Wilfrid Gore Browne#Concerns with education and teacher training|Gore Browne (Native) Training School]] was closed down). Other [[Pass Laws Act|legislation]] restricted the movement of Africans and some public places became 'Europeans Only' preserves in terms of the [[Reservation of Separate Amenities Act]]. The [[Native Laws Amendment Act]] sought to cleave church communities along racial lines – a law rejected on behalf of all Anglicans in South Africa by Archbishop [[Geoffrey Hare Clayton|Clayton]] in 1957 (in terms of which this aspect of apartheid was never completely implemented in churches such as Kimberley's St Cyprian's Cathedral).<ref name="Paton1974">{{cite book |last=Paton |first=Alan |author-link=Alan Paton |title=Apartheid and the Archbishop: The Life and Times of Geoffrey Clayton, Archbishop of Cape Town |url=https://archive.org/details/apartheidarchbis0000pato |url-access=registration |year=1974 |publisher=Scribner |isbn=978-0-684-13713-1}}</ref><ref>[http://www.disa.ukzn.ac.za/webpages/DC/rejan74.4/rejan74.4.pdf Review of Paton's ''Apartheid and the Archbishop'' by Edgar Brookes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311003158/http://www.disa.ukzn.ac.za/webpages/DC/rejan74.4/rejan74.4.pdf |date=11 March 2012 }}</ref>

Resistance to apartheid in Kimberley was mounted as early as mid-1952 as part of the [[Defiance Campaign]]. Dr Arthur Letele put together a group of volunteers to defy the segregation laws by occupying 'Europeans Only' benches at Kimberley Railway Station – which led to arrest and imprisonment. Later in the year, the [[Mayibuye Uprising]] in Kimberley, on 8 November 1952, revolved around the poor quality of beer served in the beer hall. The fracas resulted in shootings and a subsequent mass funeral on 12 November 1952 at Kimberley's West End Cemetery. Detained following the massacre were alleged 'ring-leaders' Dr Letele, Sam Phakedi, Pepys Madibane, Olehile Sehume, Alexander Nkoane, Daniel Chabalala and David Mpiwa.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://sahistory.org.za/pages/chronology/thisday/1952-11-08.htm |title=Mayibuye Uprising-black South Africans, slaves in the land of their birth, rose up to peacefully throw off their shackles |last=Anonymous |date=16 March 2011|work=South African History Online |access-date=9 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109051719/http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/chronology/thisday/1952-11-08.htm |archive-date=9 November 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Archdeacon Wade of St Matthew's Church, as a witness at the subsequent inquiry, placed the blame squarely on the policy of apartheid – including poor housing, lighting and public transport, together with "unfulfilled promises" – which he said "brought about the conditions which led to the riots."<ref>[http://www.disa.ukzn.ac.za/webpages/DC/ipjan53n4/ipjan53n4.pdf Indian Opinion 23 Jan 1953 – Apartheid policy responsible for riots] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311003257/http://www.disa.ukzn.ac.za/webpages/DC/ipjan53n4/ipjan53n4.pdf |date=11 March 2012 }}</ref>

A later generation of anti-apartheid activists based in Kimberley included [[Phakamile Mabija]], Bishop Graham Chadwick and two post-apartheid provincial premiers, [[Manne Dipico]] and [[Dipuo Peters]].
Other prominent figures of the struggle against apartheid who had Kimberley connections include [[Robert Sobukwe]], founder of the [[Pan Africanist Congress]], who was banished (placed under house arrest) in Kimberley after his release from Robben Island in 1969. He died in the city in 1978. 

[[Benny Alexander]] (1955–2010), who later changed his name to [[Khoisan X]], and was General Secretary of the Pan Africanist Congress and of the Pan-Africanist Movement from 1989, was born and grew up in Kimberley.

=== Post-Apartheid ===
The [[Northern Cape Province]] became a political fact in 1994, with Kimberley as its capital. Some quasi-provincial infrastructure was in place from the 1940s, but in the post-1994 period Kimberley underwent considerable development as administrative departments were set up and housed for the governance of the new province. A Northern Cape Legislature was designed and situated to bridge the formerly divided city. The Kimberley City Council of the renamed [[Sol Plaatje Local Municipality]] (see below) was enlarged. A new coat of arms and Motto for the city were ushered in.

With the abolition of apartheid previously 'whites only' institutions such as schools became accessible to all, as did suburbs previously segregated by the [[Group Areas Act]]. In practice this process has been one of upward mobility by those who could afford the more costly options, while by far the majority of Black people remain in the townships where poverty levels are high.

Major township residential developments, with '[[Reconstruction and Development Programme|RDP]] housing', were implemented – not without criticism concerning quality. There has been an increase in Kimberley's population, urbanization being spurred on in part by the abolition of the Influx Control Act.

Also added to the city is the settlement of Platfontein created when the [[!Xun people|!Xun]] and Khwe community formerly of [[Schmidtsdrift, Northern Cape|Schmidtsdrift]] and originally from Angola/Namibia acquired the land in 1996. Most of the community had moved to the new township by the end of 2003.

In 1998 the Kimberley Comprehensive Urban Plan estimated that Kimberley had 210,800 people representing 46,207 households living in the city.

By 2008 estimates were in the region of 250,000 inhabitants.

====Renaming====
The shifts from frontier farm names to digger camp names to the established names of the towns of Kimberley and Beaconsfield – which duly amalgamated in 1912 – are outlined above. The only traces of any precolonial settlement within the city's boundaries are scatters of [[Later Stone Age|Stone Age]] artefacts and there is no record of what the place/s might have been called before the first nineteenth century frontier overlay of farm names. It lay beyond the areas occupied by [[Tswana people]] in the precolonial period.<ref name="Shillington1985">{{cite book |last=Shillington |first=Kevin |title=The Colonisation of the Southern Tswana, 1879-1900 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hWffoAEACAAJ |year=1985 |publisher=Ravan Press |isbn=978-0-86975-270-8}}</ref> Sites such as the nearby [[Wildebeest Kuil Rock Art Centre|Wildebeest Kuil]] testify to a Khoe–San history dating up into the nineteenth century.

In the post-1994 era the Kimberley City Council was renamed the [[Sol Plaatje Local Municipality]] after the area it served was expanded to include surrounding towns and villages, most notably [[Ritchie, Northern Cape|Ritchie]]. [[Sol Plaatje]], the prominent writer and activist, lived for much of his life in Kimberley. Similarly the erstwhile Diamantveld District Council became the [[Frances Baard District Municipality]], with reference to the trade unionist, [[Frances Baard]], who was born in Greenpoint, Kimberley.

The design was a combination of the [[Union Jack]] and the charges from the [[Coat of arms of the Cape Colony|Cape Colony's coat of arms]], with a lozenge to represent the diamond-mining industry : ''Azure, a cross and saltire superimposed Gules both fimbriated Argent, in chief three bezants Or, each charged with a fleur de lis Azure, and in base three annulets Or; on a lozenge Or, superimposed over the fess point, a lion rampant Gules''. The motto was ''Spero meliora''. The arms were depicted on a cigarette card issued in 1931.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Category:UTC_South_African_town_arms |title=South African Town Arms |website=ngw.nl|date=30 September 2018 }}</ref>
 
Divisional council – The Kimberley divisional council, which administered the rural areas outside the city, registered its own arms at the Bureau in August 1970.<ref name=boh />

The arms were: ''Per saltire, in chief, barry wavy of six Argent and Azure; in base, Argent, a pale Sable charged with three fusils Argent; dexter, Gules, a shovel and pick in saltire, handles downward, Or; sinister, a staff of Aesculapius, Or''. In layman's terms, the shield was divided in four by two diagonal lines, and depicted (1) six silver and blue stripes with wavy edges, (2) a crossed pick and shovel on a red background, (3) a golden staff of Aesculapius, and (4) three silver diamond-shaped fusils on a black vertical stripe on a silver background.

The crest was two crossed rifles in front of an upright sword; the supporters were two kudus; and the motto was "Nitanir semper ad optima".

==Economy==
Kimberley was the initial hub of industrialisation in South Africa in the late nineteenth century, which transformed the country's agrarian economy into one more dependent on its mineral wealth. A key feature of the new economic arrangement was migrant labour, with the demand for African labour in the mines of Kimberley (and later on the gold fields) drawing workers in growing numbers from throughout the subcontinent. The labour [[Compound (migrant labour)|compound]] system developed in Kimberley from the 1880s was later replicated on the gold mines and elsewhere.<ref name="Roberts1976" />

The city housed South Africa's first [[stock exchange]], the Kimberley Royal Stock Exchange, which opened on 2 February 1881.<ref name="Roberts1976" />

[[File:Du Toit's Pan road Kimberley SA.jpg|thumb|left|Du Toit's Pan Road Kimberley, 1899]]
On 2 September 1882, Kimberley became the first town in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] to install [[electricity|electric]] [[street lighting]].<ref name="Michael2004">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_57gyw36xwk8C |title=Every Step of the Way |author=Morris |publisher=Human Sciences Research Council |isbn=0-7969-2061-3 |year=2004 |first=Michael |last2=Linnegar |first2=John}}</ref><ref name="Christie1984">{{cite book |last=Christie |first=Renfrew |author-link=Renfrew Christie |title=Electricity, Industry and Class in South Africa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WA0NFdZOK7QC |year=1984 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-87395-854-7 |pages=5–6}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=A Symphony of Power: The Eskom Story |last1=Conradie |first1=S. R. |publisher=Chris van Rensburg Publications |year=2000 |location=Johannesburg |pages=13 |last2=Messerschmidt |first2=L. J. M.}}</ref>

The rising importance of Kimberley led to one of the earliest South African and International Exhibitions to be staged in Kimberley in [[South African and International Exhibition|1892]]. It was opened by Sir [[Henry Loch]], the then Governor of the Cape of Good Hope on 8 September. It presented exhibits of art, an exhibition of paintings from the royal collection of Queen Victoria and mining machinery and implements amongst other items. The exhibition aroused considerable interest at international level, which resulted in a competition for display space.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

South Africa's first [[Old School of Mines, Kimberley|school of mines]] was opened here in 1896 and later relocated to [[Johannesburg]], becoming the core of the [[University of the Witwatersrand]]. A Pretoria campus later became the [[University of Pretoria]]. In fact the first two years were attended at colleges elsewhere, in [[Cape Town]], [[Grahamstown]] or [[Stellenbosch]], the third year in Kimberley and the fourth year in Johannesburg. Buildings were constructed against a total cost of 9,000 pounds with [[De Beers]] contributing on a pound for pound basis.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Transport===
====Aviation====
South Africa's [[History of the South African Air Force|first school of aviation]], to train pilots for the proposed South African Aviation Corps (SAAC), was established in Kimberley in 1913.<ref name="Becker9">{{cite book |last=Becker |first=Dave |title=On Wings of Eagles: South Africa's Military Aviation History |place=Durban |publisher=Walker-Ramus Trading Co. |year=1991 |edition=1 |isbn=0-947478-47-7 |page=9}}</ref> Known as ''Paterson's Aviation Syndicate School of Flying'', it is commemorated in the Pioneers of Aviation Museum (and replica of the first Compton Patterson Biplane preserved there), situated near to Kimberley airport. In the 1930s Kimberley boasted the best night-landing facilities on the continent of Africa. A major air rally was hosted there in 1934. In the war years Kimberley Airport was commandeered by the [[South African Defence Force|Union Defence Force]] and run by the 21 Flying School for the training of fighter pilots.<ref name="Roberts1976" />

Today [[Kimberley Airport]] {{airport codes|KIM|FAKM}} services the area, with regular scheduled flights from [[Cape Town International Airport|Cape Town]] and [[OR Tambo International Airport|Johannesburg]].

====Railways====
{{Further |Trams in Kimberley, Northern Cape}}
Work on connecting Kimberley by rail to the cities along the [[Cape Colony]]'s coastline began in 1872, under the management of the [[Cape Government Railways]].<ref>Burman, Jose (1984). ''Early Railways at the Cape''. Cape Town. Human & Rousseau, p.95. {{ISBN|0-7981-1760-5}}</ref> The railway line from Cape Town to Kimberley was completed in 1885, accelerating the transport of both passengers and goods.<ref name="Roberts1976" /> The railway connected Kimberley with cheaper sources of grain and other products, as well as supplies of coal, so that one of its local impacts was to undercut (mainly African) trade in fresh produce and firewood in Kimberley's hinterland.<ref name="Worger1987">{{cite book |last=Worger |first=William H. |title=South Africa's City of Diamonds: Mine Workers and Monopoly Capitalism in Kimberley, 1867-1895 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tXR_QgAACAAJ |year=1987 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-03716-6}}</ref> Another footnote to railway history is its role in the initial rapid spread of the Spanish Influenza epidemic in 1918.

The railway reticulation eventually would link Kimberley with Port Elizabeth, Johannesburg, Durban and Bloemfontein. The major junction at De Aar in the Karoo linked early twentieth century lines to Upington (later to Namibia) and to Calvinia. From the 1990s there was a decline in the use of the railways.

Today passenger train services to and from Kimberley are provided by [[Spoornet]]'s [[Shosholoza Meyl]], with connections south to Cape Town and Port Elizabeth and north to Johannesburg. Luxury railway experiences are provided on the main north–south line by the Blue Train and [[Rovos Rail]]. The central railway station of Kimberley is [[Kimberley railway station (South Africa)|Kimberley railway station]].

====Roads====
Wagon and coach routes were developed rapidly as the rush for the diamond fields gathered momentum. Two of the major routes were from the Cape and from Port Elizabeth, the nearest maritime port at the time. Contemporary accounts of the 1870s describe the appalling condition of some of the roads and decry the absence of bridges.<ref name="Holub1881">{{cite book |last=Holub |first=Emil |author-link=Emil Holub |title=Seven Years in South Africa: Travels, Researches, and Hunting Adventures, Between the Diamond-fields and the Zambesi (1872-79). |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Seven_Years_in_South_Africa |year=1881 |publisher=S. Low, Marston, Searle & Rivington}}</ref> From the mid-1880s the route through Kimberley and Mafeking (now Mahikeng) became the main axis of British colonial penetration and it was from Kimberley, along that route, that the Pioneer Column for the settlement of Rhodesia set forth in 1890. Today, however, the central arterial route to the north, the [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1]] from the Cape to Johannesburg, goes via Bloemfontein, not Kimberley.

Kimberley is located at the intersection of the [[N12 road (South Africa)|N12]] and [[N8 road (South Africa)|N8]] national roads.

===Today===
Today, Kimberley is the seat of the Provincial Legislature for the Northern Cape and the Provincial Administration. It services the mining and agricultural sectors of the region.

====Tourism====
The city projects itself as a significant tourist destination, the 'City that Sparkles', boasting a diversity of museums and visitor attractions. It is also a gateway to other Northern Cape destinations including the Mokala National Park, nature reserves and numerous game farms or hunting lodges, as well as historic sites of the region.

====Conference-hosting====
Kimberley has hosted significant meetings and conferences, developing a major venue, the Mittah Seperepere Convention Centre, and other conference hosting facilities. Recent gatherings have included the founding meeting of the [[Kimberley Process Certification Scheme|Kimberley Process]] (2000) and a follow-up meeting of this organisation in 2013, and the International Indigenous Peoples Summit on Sustainable Development (2002).

== Climate and geography ==
=== Climate ===
Under the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen system]] Kimberley has a [[semi-arid climate]] (BSh) courtesy of its dry winters. Summers are long, wet, and long lasting. Winters are short, mild, and dry with chilly nights.

===Demography===
According to the [[South African National Census of 2011|2011 census]], the population of Kimberley "proper" was 96,977,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Main Place Kimberley |url=http://census2011.adrianfrith.com/place/383006 |work=Census 2011}}</ref> while the [[township (South Africa)|townships]] [[Galeshewe]] and [[Roodepan]] had populations of 107,920<ref>{{Cite web |title=Main Place Galeshewe |url=http://census2011.adrianfrith.com/place/383005 |work=Census 2011}}</ref> and 20,263<ref>{{Cite web |title=Main Place Roodepan |url=http://census2011.adrianfrith.com/place/383003 |work=Census 2011}}</ref> respectively. This gives the urban area a total population of 225,160. Of this population, 63.1% identified themselves as "[[Bantu peoples in South Africa|Black African]]", 26.8% as "[[Coloured]]", 8.0% as "[[White South African|White]]" and 1.2% as "[[Indian South African|Indian]] or [[Asian South African|Asian]]". 43.2% of the population spoke [[Afrikaans]] as their [[first language]], 35.8% spoke [[Setswana]], 8.7% spoke [[South African English|English]], 6.0% spoke [[isiXhosa]] and 2.7% spoke [[Sesotho]].

===Landscapes, urban and rural===
Kimberley is set in a relatively flat landscape with no prominent topographic features within the urban limits. The only "hills" are debris dumps generated by more than a century of diamond mining. From the 1990s these were being recycled and poured back into De Beers Mine (by 2010 it was filled to within a few tens of metres of the surface). Certain of the mine dumps, in the vicinity of the Big Hole, have been proclaimed as heritage features and are to be preserved as part of the historic industrial landscape of Kimberley.

The surrounding rural landscape, not more than a few minutes' drive from any part of the city, consists of relatively flat plains dotted with hills, mainly outcropping basement rock (andesite) to the north and north west, or Karoo age dolerite to the south and east. Shallow pans formed in the plains.

[[File:Lesser Flamingos, 2000 adults, Kamfersdam.jpg|right|thumb|Flamingos on an artificial island in [[Kamfers Dam]]. This feature was submerged for a time as water levels rose in 2012]]

One of Kimberley's famous features is [[Kamfers Dam]], a large pan north of the city, which is an important wetland supporting a breeding colony of [[lesser flamingo]]s. Conservation initiatives in the area aim to bring people from the city in touch with its wildlife. In 2012 rising water levels flooded the artificial island built to enhance flamingo breeding, while in December 2013 a local outbreak of avian botulism bacteria resulted in the deaths of hundreds of birds.<ref>Wildenboer, N. 2013. Expert confirms Kamfers Dam birds' cause of death. ''Diamond Fields Advertiser'' 13 December 2013 p 11</ref> The island has since re-emerged.

==Local and provincial government==
{{Unsourced|section|date=August 2023}}
[[File:Main building of the Northern Cape Provincial Legislature.jpg|thumb|left|The provincial legislature is situated in the Galeshewe township of Kimberlely]]
The administration of the Crown Colony of [[Griqualand West]] (from 1873) was conducted from Government Buildings in Kimberley up until the annexation of the Colony to the [[Cape Colony|Cape]] in 1880. At the level of local government, separate Borough Councils operated in Kimberley and Beaconsfield up to the time of their amalgamation as the City of Kimberley in 1912. Thereafter a single City Council regulated the affairs of the city, while a Divisional Council administered the surrounding rural district. In the 1980s, in the last days of apartheid, a separate political entity referred to as Galeshewe (with Mankurwane) was brought into existence with its own council.

Post-1994 the Kimberley City Council became the [[Sol Plaatje Local Municipality]] while the successor to what had become the Diamandveld Regional Services Council was the [[Frances Baard District Municipality]].

The idea of establishing the Northern Cape as a distinct geographic entity dates from the 1940s but it became a political and administrative fact only in 1994, with Kimberley formally becoming the new province's legislative capital. The [[Northern Cape Provincial Legislature|provincial legislature]] initially occupied the old Cape Provincial Administration building at the Civic Centre before moving into a purpose-built Legislature deliberately situated between one of the townships and erstwhile white suburbs. Kimberley is also the seat of the [[Northern Cape Division]] of the [[High Court of South Africa]], which exercises jurisdiction over the province.

==== Sol Plaatje University ====
[[File:Sol Plaatje University 46.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Sol Plaatjie University Central Campus part of which is still under construction.]]
The [[Sol Plaatje University]] opened in Kimberley in 2014, accommodating a modest initial intake of 135 students.

===Quotations===
"Kimberley has had a profound effect on the course of history in Southern Africa. The discovery of diamonds there, more than a century ago, proved to be the first step in the transformation of South Africa from an agricultural into an industrial country. When gold and other minerals were later discovered to the north, there were already Kimberley men of vision and enterprise with the capital and technology to develop the new resources." - [[Harry Oppenheimer|H.F. Oppenheimer]], 1976. Foreword to [[Brian Roberts (Historian)|Brian Roberts]]’ book, ''Kimberley, turbulent city''.

[[Anthony Trollope]] visited Kimberley in 1877 and was notoriously put off by the heat, enervating and hideous, while the dust and the flies of the early mining town almost drove him mad:
"I sometimes thought that the people of Kimberley were proud of their flies and their dust."
Of the townscape, largely built of sun-dried brick, and of plank and canvas and corrugated iron sheets brought up by ox-wagon from the coast, he remarked:
"In Kimberley there are two buildings with a storey above the ground, and one of these is in the square: this is its only magnificence. There is no pavement. The roadway is all dust and holes. There is a market place in the midst which certainly is not magnificent. Around are the corrugated iron shops of the ordinary dealers in provisions. An uglier place I do not know how to imagine."<ref name="Roberts1976" />{{rp|159–60}}

A.H.J. Bourne, a former headmaster of [[Kimberley Boys' High School]], returned to the city in 1937, observing that: "The history of Kimberley would appear remarkable to any stranger who could not fail to think that some supermind was behind its destinies. In so short a time it has grown from bare veld."<ref>cited in L. Moult. 1987. ''KHStory'', p 126</ref>

In the early 1990s writer [[Dan Jacobson]] returned to Kimberley, where he had grown up in the 1930s, giving a sense of how things had changed:
"The people I had known had vanished; so had their language. That contributed to my ghostlike state. In my earliest years the whites of Kimberley spoke English only; Afrikaans was the tongue of the Cape Coloured people ... Now I was addressed in Afrikaans everywhere I went, by white, black, and Coloured alike".<ref>Dan Jacobson, ''The Electronic Elephant: A Southern African Journey'', London: Penguin, 1994, p 73</ref>

Kimberley dull? – asked ''virtualtourist'' reviewer Catherine Reichardt: "Happily, the answer is a resounding 'No', provided that you have a passion for history - in which case Kimberley has it in spades, and you'll probably need to overnight to fully appreciate its attractions and charms. In many ways, exploring Kimberley and its heritage is like experiencing South African history in microcosm."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://members.virtualtourist.com/m/136668/21e94e/ |title=VirtualTourist.com ceased operations |website=members.virtualtourist.com |language=en |access-date=2017-09-09}}</ref>

*The '''[[Kimberley Process Certification Scheme]]''' (KPCS) is an initiative for preventing trade in "conflict diamonds" used to finance the undermining of legitimate governments. It was founded in 2003, following a May 2000 meeting of Southern African diamond-producing states in Kimberley. A tenth anniversary meeting of the Kimberley Process was held at the Mittah Seperepere Convention Centre, Kimberley, on 4--7 June 2013, bringing together representatives of Governments, the diamond industry and civil society. A commemorative event was held at the Kimberley Tabernacle, the venue for the original meeting of the KPCS, where 23 individuals present at the first meeting were honoured for their involvement. South African Minister of Mineral Resources, [[Susan Shabangu]], addressed the closing session, noting the role of the KPCS in minimising "blood diamond" trade, as well as its "significant developmental impact in improving the lives of people dependent on the trade in diamonds."<ref>[https://archive.today/20130624212035/http://www.info.gov.za/speech/DynamicAction?pageid=461&tid=109678 Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) Intersessional Meeting ends with review on processes and functions] Accessed 7 June 2013.</ref>
