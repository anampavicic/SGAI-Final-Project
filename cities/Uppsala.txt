'''Uppsala''' ({{IPA|sv|ˈɵ̂pːˌsɑːla|-|sv-Uppsala.ogg}}; archaically spelled ''Upsala'') is the county seat of [[Uppsala County]] and the [[List of urban areas in Sweden by population|fourth-largest city]] in [[Sweden]], after [[Stockholm]], [[Gothenburg]], and [[Malmö]]. It had 177,074 inhabitants in 2019.<ref name="uppsala2019" /><!-- Please do not change the figures to the population for Uppsala kommun; this article is about the town, not the municipality -->

Located {{convert|71|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the capital Stockholm it is also the seat of [[Uppsala Municipality]]. Since 1164, Uppsala has been the [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] centre of Sweden, being the seat of the [[Archbishop of Uppsala|Archbishop]] of the [[Church of Sweden]]. Uppsala is home to Scandinavia's largest cathedral – [[Uppsala Cathedral]], which was the frequent site of the [[coronation of the Swedish monarch]] until the late 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.destinationuppsala.se/en/To-do/ToDo/?tlang=en&tid=721681|title=Uppsala cathedral – DestinationUppsalaWeb|website=DestinationUppsala.se|access-date=2016-03-22|archive-date=19 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190319212839/http://www.destinationuppsala.se/en/To-do/ToDo/?tlang=en&tid=721681|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[Uppsala Castle]], built by King [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]], served as one of the royal residences of the Swedish monarchs, and was expanded several times over its history, making Uppsala the secondary capital of Sweden during its [[Swedish Empire|greatest extent]]. Today, it serves as the residence of the [[Governor of Uppsala County]].

Founded in 1477, [[Uppsala University]] is the oldest centre of higher education in [[Scandinavia]]. Among the many scholars associated with the city are [[Anders Celsius]], inventor of the [[Celsius|centigrade temperature scale]] that now bears his name, and [[Carl Linnaeus]], the father of [[taxonomy]].

Other Uppsala residents include filmmaker [[Ingmar Bergman]], diplomat [[Dag Hammarskjöld]], chemists [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]] and [[Svante Arrhenius]], actress [[Viveca Lindfors]], and singer [[Malena Ernman]].

Uppsala was originally the name of a place a few [[kilometre]]s north of the current city, now known as [[Gamla Uppsala]] (Old Uppsala). Today's Uppsala was then called ''Östra Aros'' (Eastern Aros, to differentiate it from [[Västerås|Western Aros]]). (Old) Uppsala was, according to medieval writer [[Adam of Bremen]], the main [[paganism|pagan]] centre of Sweden, and the [[Temple at Uppsala]] contained magnificent idols of the [[Æsir|Norse gods]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrons/bremen.htm#descrip |title=Descriptio Insularum Aquilonis |language=la |author=Adam of Bremen |date=c. 1075 |access-date=15 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050207105412/http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrons/bremen.htm#descrip |archive-date=7 February 2005 |df=dmy-all |author-link=Adam of Bremen }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://runeberg.org/adamafbrem/0234.htm |title=Adam af Bremen om Menigheden i Norden under Erkesædet i Bremen og Hamborg (788–1072) |page=194 |language=da |author=P. W. Christensen |year=1862 |publisher=Karl Schønbergs Forlag |access-date=15 January 2012}}</ref> The Kungsängen plains along the river south of Uppsala have been identified as a possible match for [[Fyrisvellir]], the site of the [[Battle of Fyrisvellir]] in the 980s.
The present-day Uppsala was at that time a port town of [[Gamla Uppsala]]. In 1160, King [[Eric IX of Sweden|Eric Jedvardsson]] was attacked and killed outside the church of Östra Aros, and later became venerated as a saint in the [[Catholic Church]]. In 1274, Östra Aros overtook [[Gamla Uppsala]] as the main regional centre, and when the cathedral of Gamla Uppsala burnt down, the archbishopric and the relics of Saint Eric were moved to Östra Aros, where the present-day [[Uppsala Cathedral]] was erected; it was inaugurated in 1435. The cathedral is built in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style and is one of the largest in northern Europe, with towers reaching {{convert|118.70|m}}.

The city is the site of the oldest university in [[Scandinavia]], founded in 1477, and is where [[Carl Linnaeus]], one of the renowned scholars of [[Uppsala University]], lived for many years; both his house and garden can still be visited. Uppsala is also the site of the 16th-century [[Uppsala Castle]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uu.se/en/node97 |title=Uppsala universitet - Uppsala University History |access-date=8 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608163154/http://www.uu.se/en/node97 |archive-date=8 June 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> {{anchor|1702 fire}}The city was severely damaged by a fire in 1702.

Historical and cultural treasures were also lost, as in many Swedish cities, from demolitions during the 1960s and 1970s, but many historic buildings remain, especially in the western part of the city. The arms bearing the lion can be traced to 1737 and have been modernised several times, most recently in 1986. The meaning of the lion is uncertain, but is likely connected to the royal lion, also depicted on the [[Coat of Arms of Sweden]].

In ecclesiastical terms, the place has always belonged to Uppsala parish, from 1961 called Uppsala cathedral parish. The incorporated parts of Uppsala belong to Gamla Uppsala parish, Helga Trefaldighets parish and Vaksala parish. After parish break-up in 1974, parts of the town are located in Gottsunda parish. After further building expansion, some are also in Denmark-Funbo parish, before 2010 in Denmark parish.<ref>[http://www.skatteverket.se/privat/folkbokforing/omfolkbokforing/folkbokforingigaridag/sverigesforsamlingargenomtiderna/forteckning.4.18e1b10334ebe8bc80003999.html "Förteckning (Sveriges församlingar genom tiderna)"]. [[Skatteverket]]. 1989.</ref>

Until 1971, the town was part of the district court for Uppsala City Hall Court and has been part of the Uppsala Court since 1971.

== Geography ==

[[File:Uppsala by Sentinel-2, 2020-06-10.jpg|left|thumb|Satellite picture of Uppsala]]
Situated on the fertile Uppsala flatlands of muddy soil, the city features the small Fyris River ([[Fyrisån]]) flowing through the landscape surrounded by lush vegetation. Parallel to the river runs the [[Esker|glacial ridge]] of Uppsalaåsen at an elevation around {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the site of Uppsala's castle, from which large parts of the town can be seen. The central park ''Stadsskogen'' (literally "City Forest") stretches from the south far into town, with opportunities for recreation for many residential areas within walking distance.

Located approximately {{convert|70|km|0|abbr=on}} or 40 minutes by train from the capital, many Uppsala residents work in Stockholm. The train to [[Stockholm-Arlanda Airport]] takes 17 minutes, rendering the city easily accessible by air. Just like Stockholm, Uppsala is located on Sweden's east coast at the 59th parallel north.<ref name="Nord59.se">{{cite web|title=Nord59.se|url=https://nord59.se/#uppsala|access-date=13 April 2024|language=en}}</ref>

The commercial centre of Uppsala is quite compact. The city has a distinct [[town and gown]] divide with clergy, royalty, and academia historically residing in the [[Fjärdingen]] neighbourhood on the river's western shore, somewhat separated from the rest of the city, and the ensemble of cathedral, castle and university buildings has remained mostly undisturbed to this day. While some historic buildings remain on the periphery of the central core, retail commercial activity is geographically focused on a small number of blocks around the pedestrianized streets and main square on the eastern side of the river, an area that was subject to a large-scale metamorphosis during the economically booming years in the 1960s in particular. During recent decades, a significant part of retail commercial activity has shifted to shopping malls and stores situated in the outskirts of the city. Meanwhile, the built-up areas have expanded greatly, and some suburbanization has taken place.

=== Climate ===
Uppsala lies immediately south of the [[60th parallel north]] and has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Dfb]]), with cold winters and warm summers. Due to its northerly location, Uppsala experiences over 18 hours of visible sunshine during the [[summer solstice]], and under 6 hours of sunshine during the [[winter solstice]]. Despite Uppsala's northerly location, the winter is not as cold as other cities at similar latitudes, mainly due to the [[Gulf Stream]]. For example, in January Uppsala has a daily mean of {{convert|-2.7|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. In [[Canada]], at the same latitude, [[Fort Smith, Northwest Territories|Fort Smith]] experiences a daily mean of {{convert|-22.4|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.

With respect to record temperatures, the difference between the highest and lowest is relatively large. Uppsala's highest recorded temperature was {{convert|37.4|C|F|1}}, recorded on 9 July 1933.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smhi.se/kunskapsbanken/meteorologi/temperaturrekord-i-stockholm-och-uppsala-1.4735|title=Temperaturrekord i Stockholm och Uppsala|website=smhi.se}}</ref> On the same day [[Ultuna]], which lies a few kilometres south of the centre of Uppsala, recorded a temperature of {{convert|38|C|F|1}}. This is the highest temperature ever recorded in the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]], although the same temperature was recorded in [[Målilla]], Sweden, 14 years later. Uppsala's lowest temperature was recorded on 24 January 1875, when the temperature dropped to {{convert|-39.5|C|F|1}}. The second-lowest temperature recorded is {{convert|-33.1|C|F|1}}, which makes the record one of the hardest to beat, due to the fact that temperatures in Uppsala nowadays rarely goes below {{convert|-30|C|F|0}}. The difference between the two records is {{convert|76.9|C-change|1}}.

The warmest month ever recorded is July 2018, with a daily mean of {{convert|22.0|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Since 2002 Uppsala has experienced 7 months where the daily mean was {{convert|20|°C|°F|abbr=on}} or warmer, the most recent in July 2021 when the daily mean was {{convert|20.7|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. The coldest month ever recorded is January 1814, when the daily mean was {{convert|-14.9|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Between January 1814 and January 1987, Uppsala experienced 23 months that were colder than {{convert|-10|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Since February 1987, the coldest month recorded is {{convert|-8.6|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. The warmest year ever recorded was 2014, with an average temperature of {{convert|8.1|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. The second warmest is 2018, with {{convert|8.0|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Since 1991, Uppsala has recorded 15 years with an average temperature of {{convert|7|°C|°F|abbr=on}} or warmer. The coldest year ever recorded was 1867, with an average temperature of {{convert|2.5|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. 1987 was the last year Uppsala recorded a year with an average temperature below {{convert|5|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.

The climate table below presents weather data from 1981 to 2010. According to ongoing measurements, the temperature has increased during 1981–2010 as compared with the 1951–1980 series. This increase is on an annual basis around 0.9&nbsp;°C. Warming is most pronounced during the winter and spring. January, February, and March have had the most pronouncing increase in temperature, with each month increasing 1.5&nbsp;°C or more. The only month that did not get warmer is June, which got 0.3&nbsp;°C colder. During the 20th century, Uppsala has warmed drastically, especially the winter. If compared to the period 1861–1890, the annual increase in temperature is 1.8&nbsp;°C. March is the month with the biggest increase, where the temperature has increased more than 3&nbsp;°C since the latter parts of the 19th century.

Winter normally arrives in late November, and lasts until the middle of March when spring arrives. Summer usually arrives in the middle of May, and lasts until late September when autumn arrives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smhi.se/kunskapsbanken/meteorologi/arstider-1.1082|title=Årstider|website=smhi.se}}</ref> Precipitation is most common between June and November, in all these months it falls {{convert|50|mm|in|abbr=on}} or more on average. August receives most precipitation with {{convert|74|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Between January and May precipitation levels fall a bit, with all months receiving less than {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} on average. Annual precipitation is {{convert|576|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Rainfall can occur all year round, although it is less common in January and February. Snowfall mainly occurs between November and March. Snowfall in October and April can happen from time to time, but not every year. During the night between 30 April and 1 May 2014, approximately {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} of snow fell in Uppsala, the first recorded snowfall in May since 1981. Uppsala has an annual average snow cover around 100 days.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smhi.se/data/meteorologi/sno/normalt-antal-dygn-med-snotacke-per-ar-1.7937|title=Normalt antal dygn med snötäcke per år|website=smhi.se}}</ref>

== Economy ==

Uppsala has economic development in many sectors. Today Uppsala is well established in medical research and recognised for its leading position in [[biotechnology]].
*Abbott Medical Optics (AMO)
*[[Cytiva]]
*[[Pfizer]] (see [[Pharmacia]])
*[[Phadia]], an offshoot of Pharmacia, now a part of [[Thermo Fisher Scientific]]
*[[Fresenius SE|Fresenius]]
*Q-Med (bioscience)
*Biotage
*Skandion Kliniken, [[proton therapy]] centre
*[[Uppsala Monitoring Centre]], a collaboration between the WHO and the Swedish government known for their 'WHODD' medical coding dictionary.
*[[IAR Systems]]

== Higher education ==

=== Universities ===
*[[Uppsala University]]. Founded in 1477, under bishop [[Jakob Ulvsson]]. Originally a Catholic institution, after limited activity following the [[Reformation]] it was re-organised as a Lutheran institution in 1595, following the [[Uppsala Synod]] in 1593. The university has a famous [[anatomical theatre]], constructed by the scientist and [[polymath]] [[Olof Rudbeck]] (1630–1702), in the old university building [[Gustavianum]]. The building is now a museum. The university has 13 student fraternities, known as "nations", each traditionally representing a geographical region of Sweden.
*[[Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences]] (SLU, Sveriges Lantbruksuniversitet, main campus).

=== Other higher education ===
* [[Johannelunds Teologiska Högskola]]. A Lutheran theological seminary established in 1862, located in Uppsala since 1970.
* The [[Newman Institute (Uppsala)|Newman Institute]]. A Catholic institution founded in 2001.
* [[Pingströrelsens teologiska seminarium]]. A Pentecostal theological seminary, which does not have [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] from the Swedish [[National Agency for Higher Education]] and cannot confer Swedish academic degrees.

== Museums and sights ==
[[File:Linneanum orangery, Botaniska Trädgården, Uppsala.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Botaniska trädgården (Uppsala)|The Botanical Garden]] at Uppsala Castle]]
The Fyris river (Fyrisån) neatly divides the city into two different parts: the historic quarter to the west of the river and the modern administrative, residential and commercial city centre to the east. Most of the historical sights and university buildings are in the western part, with a medieval street layout, river views and parks and dominated by the cathedral.

The most outstanding building in Uppsala is the ''Domkyrka'' ([[Uppsala Cathedral]]), Scandinavia's largest church building ({{convert|118.70|m|2|abbr=on}} high). Together with Uppsala Castle it has dominated Uppsala's skyline since its construction in the 13th century and can be seen from a long distance outside the city, other tall buildings being rare.

Facing the west end of the cathedral is the ''[[Gustavianum]]'', built in 1625 to be the main building of the university, and served as such through most of the 19th century. It contains the Museum of Nordic Antiquities, the Victoria Museum (of Egyptian antiquities) and the university's cultural history collections. It also houses a perfectly preserved 17th-century anatomical theatre (used in its time for public dissections). Next to Gustavianum is the 18th century [[Archbishop's Palace, Uppsala|Archbishop's Palace]], the official residence of the Lutheran [[Archbishop of Uppsala]] and the primate of the Church of Sweden.

Across the street from the Gustavianum in the University Park stands the [[University Hall (Uppsala University)|University Hall]], erected in 1879–86 in Italian [[Renaissance architecture|renaissance style]]. The [[Uppsala University Coin Cabinet]] is located in the university main building.
[[File:Uppsala slott-2.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Uppsala Castle]]]]
Not far from the university stands the [[Uppsala University Library]] (''Carolina Rediviva''), the largest library in Sweden, with over 5 million volumes and some 60,000 manuscripts. The building was built in 1820–41.

On a circa 35-metre high hill to the southwest of the University Library stands ''[[Uppsala Castle]]''. Its construction was initiated in 1549 by King [[Gustav Vasa]], founder of the [[House of Vasa|Vasa royal dynasty]]. Today the castle holds several museums, among them the regional art museum, and is the residence of the [[List of Uppsala Governors|Uppsala County Governor]] (''landshövding'').

There are several [[botanical garden|botanical museums]] in Uppsala related to the world-famous 18th century botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus; the [[Botaniska trädgården (Uppsala)|Botanic Garden]] next to the castle, the [[Linnaean Garden]] in the city centre, and [[Linnaeus Hammarby]], Linnaeus' summer house in the countryside village of Danmarks Hammarby south of the city.

{{convert|5|km|0|abbr=off}} north of Uppsala city lies ''[[Gamla Uppsala]]'' (Old Uppsala), the location of the pre-Christian settlement of Uppsala which later provided the new name for the medieval settlement further south. There are few remains, with the exception of several huge burial mounds of pre-Christian monarchs and the previous cathedral from 1164 A.D., traditionally said to be built over the old [[Temple at Uppsala|heathen temple]] (and recent archaeological investigations seems to support this notion). The site was a major religious centre in Scandinavia in pre-Christian times. After the old cathedral church burned down around 1240 it was only partially restored to a more modest size as it no longer was the seat of the Archbishop.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.raa.se/cms/extern/se_och_besoka/gamla_uppsala.html |title=Gamla Uppsala – Riksantikvarieämbetet |publisher=Raa.se |date=15 September 2009 |access-date=11 October 2009 |archive-date=27 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527052622/http://www.raa.se/cms/extern/se_och_besoka/gamla_uppsala.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Gamla Uppsala Museum exhibits archeological finds made during excavations in Gamla Uppsala and related finds from other parts of [[Uppland]], as well as exhibitions on the history of the site itself.

==Transportation==

=== Roads ===
The [[European route E4]] highway passes to the east of the city and provides the main connection by road to Uppsala. Several other smaller roads, such as [[Riksväg 72]] and [[Riksväg 55|55]], connects the city with cities such as [[Enköping]] and [[Sala, Sweden|Sala]].

=== Public Transport ===
==== Buses ====
Buses within [[Uppsala Municipality]] and [[Uppsala County|county]] are operated by [[Kollektivtrafikförvaltningen UL|UL]]. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://regionuppsala.se/det-har-gor-vi/kollektivtrafik/ |title=Region Uppsala Kollektivtrafik|website=regionuppsala.se|access-date=6 May 2023}}</ref> Bus lines in Uppsala go under two categories: city buses, and county buses. City bus lines, of which there are 15, <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ul.se/globalassets/kartor/uppsala-linjenat-vinter-2021.pdf |title=Linjenät Vinter 2021|date=Winter 2021 |website=ul.se |access-date=6 May 2023}}</ref> are meant for journeys within the city. County buses, are instead meant for journeys within the wider [[Uppsala Municipality|municipality]] and [[Uppsala County|county]]. The type of bus line can be seen by its colour, as city buses are painted green while county buses are painted yellow. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://regionuppsala.se/det-har-gor-vi/kollektivtrafik/bussar/ |title= Kollektivtrafik - Bussar|website=regionuppsala.se|access-date=6 May 2023}}</ref> Three city buses, 30, 31, and 32, are known as ''mjuka linjer'', literally "soft lines", which are fitted for the [[elderly]] and [[Disability|disabled]], by having stops closer to places like [[Hospital|hospitals]] and [[pharmacy|pharmacys]], in order to reduce walking distance. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ul.se/reseinfo/tillganglighet/mjuka-linjen/ |title=Mjuka Linjen|website=ul.se|access-date= 6 May 2023}}</ref>
==== Trains ====
[[Uppsala Central Station]] is one of the busiest [[Train station|train stations]] in Sweden, with around 45 000 passengers per day. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://bygg.uppsala.se/planerade-omraden/uppsala-c/darfor-ska-stationsomradet-byggas-om/ |title=Därför ska stationsområdetbyggas om|date=28 April 2023|website=Uppsala.se|access-date=7 May 2023}}</ref> The station is served by several different train operators, with [[Mälartåg]], [[SJ AB|SJ]] and [[Storstockholms Lokaltrafik|SL]] being the primary ones, while [[Vy Tåg|Vy]] operates [[Sleeping car|night trains]] to [[Narvik]]. 

Trains depart [[Uppsala Central Station]] in three directions. There are trains to the south, [[Arlanda]], [[Stockholm]] and [[Linköping]], to the northwest, [[Dalarna]] and [[Sala, Sweden|Sala]], and to the north [[Gävle]], [[Sundsvall]], [[Östersund]] and to the northern half of Sweden as well as sleeper trains to [[Narvik]] in Norway.

==== Airports ====
While Uppsala has no civilian airport of its own, [[Arlanda Airport]] is located about 30&nbsp;km south of Uppsala. [[Ärna Air Base]] north of Uppsala has been proposed for development as a commercial airport, but as of 2024 remains exclusively military.

== Sports ==
[[File:Bandyfinal2010 hammarby celebration.jpg|thumb|Celebrations after the 2010 national [[bandy]] final at [[Studenternas IP]]]]

The largest arena in Uppsala is [[Fyrishov]] and is Sweden's fourth most visited, specialized in swimming, sports events, meetings and recreation. The facility includes areas for indoor sports, summer sport and a generous waterpark with waterslides, 50-meter pool, training pool, relaxation area and a large outdoor swimming pool. Accommodation is offered at the Fyrishov cabin area, and at the resort restaurants a good lunch or dinner can be enjoyed. Fyrishov AB's business also includes the operation of Gottsundabadet in which there is a 25-metre pool, a 10-metre children's pool and gym. The entire facility is open all year round and a large number of meetings and various events are held here annually.

In addition to activities within the arena Fyrishov AB runs Tävlingsstaden Uppsala in a collaboration between the sports organizers, Fyrishov AB, Uppsala, Uppsala Tourism and hotel business. Co-founded in 2006 by Fyrishov AB under the name SM-town Uppsala in 2007 but was expanded to include international events and competitions at high national level. The project aims to develop Uppsala, a leading sports town in Sweden. In 2009 there were 24 SM-competitions and major national and international competitions in Uppsala.

At Fyrishov the city's basketball team [[Uppsala Basket]] also plays, former KFUM Uppsala, their home games in the Swedish basketball league. There are also athletic club Uppsala, Uppsala, fencing club, Uppsala Judo Club, Sweden's oldest judo club, Uppsala volleyball companion, Upsala weightlifting club and [[Upsala Simsällskap]], one of the world's oldest swimmingclubs. The sport that draws the most audience is floorball. Uppsala's two teams in the Swedish Super League, Storvreta IBK and IK Sirius IBK, have Fyrishov as their home.

One of the most classical sports events, the [[Swedish bandy champions|Swedish bandy final]], took place at [[Studenternas IP]] 1991–2012. After being played indoors in Stockholm 2013–2017, from 2018 it is again played in Uppsala. It usually attracts a spectator crowd of more than 20,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYyN8q44mX8 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721075219/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYyN8q44mX8| archive-date=2013-07-21 | url-status=dead|title=Edsbyn Sandviken SM – Final in Upssala |publisher=YouTube |access-date=9 May 2010}}</ref>

Once every year, the Uppsala Union of Science and Engineering Students arrange a river rafting in the Fyris river with rafts built from styrofoam.

Other sports clubs located in Uppsala include:

* [[Dalkurd FF]]
* [[Almtuna IS]]
* [[Gamla Upsala SK]]
* [[IF Vindhemspojkarna]]
* [[IK Sirius]]
* [[IK Sirius Fotboll]]
* [[Unik FK]]

In the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel's]] Canadian-Irish TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'', Uppsala is visited by [[Ragnar Lothbrok]] and his entourage to worship the Aesir gods and offer a human sacrifice to appease them. In that visit Lothbrok meets Uppsala's King Horik. The episode was criticised for its poorly researched depiction of Uppsala, which was shown as being located in a mountainous region, as well as of its heathen temple, which in the series was built in the style of a medieval Christian [[stave church]].<ref name="unt vikings">{{cite news | url=https://www.unt.se/nyheter/uppsala/pinsamma-missarna-i-storserien-2396658.aspx | title=Pinsamma missarna i storserien | work=Upsala Nya Tidning | date=27 April 2019 | access-date=28 February 2019 | author=Hesserud-Persson, Stefan}}</ref>
