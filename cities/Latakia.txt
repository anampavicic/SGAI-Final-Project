'''Latakia''' ({{langx|ar|ٱللَّاذْقِيَّة|translit=al-Lādhiqiyya}}; <small> [[Syrian Arabic|Syrian]] pronunciation:</small> {{IPA|ar|el.laːdˈʔɪjje, -laːðˈqɪjja|}}) is the principal port city of [[Syria]] and capital city of the [[Latakia Governorate]] located on the [[Mediterranean]] coast. Historically, it has also been known as '''[[Laodicea in Syria]]''' or '''Laodicea ad Mare'''. In addition to serving as a port, the city is a significant manufacturing center for surrounding agricultural towns and villages.

[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] ruling groups frequently attacked the city, periodically recapturing it before losing it again to Arab powers, particularly the [[Fatimid]]s. Afterward, Latakia was ruled successively by the [[Seljuk Turks]], [[Crusades|Crusaders]], [[Ayyubid]]s, [[Mamluk Sultanate|Mamluks]], and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. Following [[World War I]], Latakia was assigned to the [[French mandate of Syria]], in which it served as the capital of the autonomous territory of the [[Alawite]]s.

==Etymology==
{{Distinguish|Laodicea ad Lycum}}
Like many [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] cities, Latakia was named after a member of the ruling dynasty.<ref name="le Strange380"/> It was first called ''Laodikeia on the Coast'' ({{Langx|el|Λαοδίκεια ἡ Πάραλος}}) by [[Seleucus I Nicator]] in honor of his mother, [[Laodice of Macedonia|Laodice]]. In [[Latin]], its name became ''Laodicea ad Mare''. The original name survives in its [[Arabic language|Arabic]] form as ''al-Ladhiqiyyah'' ({{langx|ar|اللاذقية}}), from which the [[French language|French]] ''Lattaquié'' and [[English language|English]] ''Latakia'' (or ''Lattakia)'' derive.<ref name="le Strange380">le Strange, 1890, p.380.</ref><ref name="Ball">Ball, 2000, p.157</ref> To the Ottomans, it was known as Lazkiye.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1030444167 |title=Tajikistan on the move : statebuilding and societal transformations |date=2018 |others=Marlène Laruelle |isbn=978-1-4985-4652-2 |location=Lanham, Maryland |pages=177 |oclc=1030444167}}</ref>

The [[Phoenicia]]n city of Ramitha was located here.{{sfn|La Boda|1994|p=451}} [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] writes that the city was named Ramitha ({{langx|grc|Ῥάμιθα}}), then ''Leukê Aktê'' ("white coast") ({{langx|grc|Λευκὴ ἀκτή}}) and later Laodicea ({{langx|grc|Λαοδίκεια}}).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://topostext.org/work/241#L411.7 |title=Stephanus of Byzantium, Ethnica, §L411.7 |access-date=2019-10-28 |archive-date=2021-04-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210410155716/https://topostext.org/work/241#L411.7 |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{blockquote|
It is a city most beautifully built, has a good harbour, and has territory which, besides its other good crops, abounds in wine. Now this city furnishes the most of the wine to the Alexandreians, since the whole of the mountain that lies above the city and is possessed by it is covered with vines almost as far as the summits. And while the summits are at a considerable distance from Lāŏdĭcḗa, sloping up gently and gradually from it, they tower above Apameia, extending up to a perpendicular height.}}

===Roman rule===
{{Main|Laodicea in Syria}}
[[File:Latakia Tetraporticus 4036.jpg|upright|alt=|left|thumb|[[Latakia Tetraporticus]], built by [[Septimius Severus]] in AD 193]]
[[Pompey the Great]] conquered the city along with most of Syria in the 1st century BC, and [[Julius Caesar]] declared the city a "free polis." The Roman emperor Septimius Severus rewarded the city with the title of "Metropolis" in the 2nd century AD, exempted it of the empire's taxation, fortified the city, made it for a few years the capital of [[Roman Syria]] and also built the city's famed Tetraporticus around the same time. Some Roman merchants moved to live in the city under [[Augustus]], but the city was always culturally "Greek" influenced. Subsequently, a [[Roman road]] was built from southern [[Anatolia]] toward [[Berytus]] and Damascus, that greatly improved the commerce through the port of Laodicea.

The heretic [[Apollinaris of Laodicea|Apollinarius]] was bishop of Lāŏdĭcḗa in the 4th century. The city minted coins from an early date, but decreasing in importance after the cities of Alexandria and Antioch flourished in coin minting and overshadowed other cities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Featured Coin |url=http://www.forumancientcoins.com/dougsmith/feac62mac.html |access-date=11 June 2016 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113258/http://www.forumancientcoins.com/dougsmith/feac62mac.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The city was also famed for its wine produced around the port's hills which were exported to all the empire.

During the split of the [[Roman Empire]], it belonged to the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. An earthquake damaged the city in 494, but the city was later reconstructed by [[Justinian I]] and made the capital of the [[Theodorias (province)|Eastern Roman province of Theodorias]] from 528 AD until Muslim conquest around 637 AD.

===Early Islamic era===
All of Syria, including the Roman province of Theodorias and its capital, [[Siege of Latakia (Laodicea) (636)|Laodicea fell]] into Muslim rule after its attacked by a caliphate general, named [['Ubadah ibn al-Samit]] during the [[Muslim conquest of Syria]] in the 7th century. The city was renamed al-Lādhiqīyah (اللَّاذِقِيَّة) and switched rule from the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], to the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] and finally to the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in a span of 9 centuries, attached to the large province of [[Bilad Al-Sham]] (Greater Syria). Arab geographer, [[Al-Muqaddasi]] (d. 991), mentions al-Lādhiqīyah as belonging to the district of Hims ([[Homs, Syria|Homs]]).<ref>Al-Muqaddasi, ''The Best Divisions for Knowledge of the Regions'' (Being a translation of "Ahsan al-Taqasim fi Maʿrifat al-Aqalim"), Reading 1994, p. 141 {{ISBN|1-873938-14-4}}</ref>

===Crusader, Ayyubid, and Mamlouk rule===
[[File:Lattakia,CatholicChurch.jpg|thumb|upright|The Latin Church of Latakia, also known as the [[Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (Latakia)|Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus]]]]
The [[Mardaites]] controlled the region from [[Jebel Aqra]] to northern [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], including Latakia in 705. However, they later withdrew from the city after an agreement with the Umayyad caliph [[Al-Walid I]]. Afterwards, the Mardaites sacked it in 719, but it was rebuilt by [[Umar II]]. The city lost its importance due to its location on the border between the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] from 750 to 968. The famous poet [[Al-Mutanabbi]] led a millenarian revolt at Latakia in 930.{{sfn|Winter|2016|p=26-27}} The Byzantine Empire recaptured the city in 970 by [[John I Tzimiskes]], but it was lost to the [[Fatimids]] in 980. The [[Banu Munqidh]] managed to control the city until they were succeeded by the [[Seljuks]] during the reign of [[Malik-Shah I]] in 1086, despite a brief Byzantine control in 1074. Later on, [[Guynemer of Boulogne]] raided the city on 19 August 1097, with 28 ships coming from [[Cyprus]] during the [[First Crusade]]. In 1098, [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse|Raymond of Saint-Gilles]] captured the city, with the Byzantine fleet presence; hence, the city became contested between the crusaders and the Byzantines who controlled Latakia and [[Baniyas]] in the meantime.{{sfn|La Boda|1994|p=453}}

After failed efforts by [[Bohemond I of Antioch]] to capture Latakia from the Byzantine Empire in 1099, and a brief control of the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] fleet in 1101, the city was taken in 1103 by forces under the command of [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred of Hauteville]], a veteran of the First Crusade and acting regent of the [[Principality of Antioch]].<ref>Thomas Asbridge, The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land, (London: Simon & Schuster, 2010), pp.137–138.</ref> Following the defeat of Antiochene forces at the [[Battle of Harran]] in 1104, the city was reoccupied by the Byzantines led by Admiral [[Cantacuzenus]],<ref>[[Steven Runciman]] (1951). ''A History of the Crusades. Vol II: The Kingdom of Jerusalem'', p. 37. {{ISBN|978-0-241-29876-3}}.</ref> however they would again lose the city. Despite a treaty in 1108 with Bohemond promising to return Latakia to the Byzantine Empire by 1110 it was firmly under the control of the Principality of Antioch,<ref>Thomas Asbridge, The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land, (London: Simon & Schuster, 2010), pp.137–144.</ref> as it was called "La Liche". In 1126, the cities of Latakia and [[Jabala]] were the dowry of Princess [[Alice of Antioch|Alice]], daughter of King [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem]], who later donated a house in Latakia to the [[Knights Hospitaller]], which became their main base in the region. In April 1136, the city was sacked by Emir Sawar ibn Aytakin, governor of [[Aleppo]], then it was struck by the [[1157 Hama earthquake]] and the [[1170 Syria earthquake]].{{sfn|La Boda|1994|p=453}}

This situation remained the same with the city serving as the primary port for the Principality until it was captured following a [[Siege of Laodicea (1188)|siege]] by the [[Ayyubids]], under the rule of [[Saladin]] on 23 July 1188. By 1260, the crusaders recaptured the city, until they were defeated by the [[Mamluks]] of [[Qalawun]],<ref>Thomas Asbridge, The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land, (London: Simon & Schuster, 2010), p.637.</ref> on 20 April 1287.

In circa 1300, Arab geographer [[Al-Dimashqi (geographer)|al-Dimashqi]] noted that Latakia had no running water and that trees were scarce, but the city's port was "a wonderful harbor... full of large ships".<ref>al-Dimashqi quoted in le Strange, 1890, p.491.</ref> In 1332, the Moroccan traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] visited Latakia in his journeys.<ref>The adventures of Ibn Battuta, a Muslim traveler of the fourteenth century By Ross E. Dunn, University of California Press. pp.137.</ref>

During the late 14th and 15th century, [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] had a consul in Latakia, due to the trade of cotton and silk from Persia.{{sfn|Ashtor|2014|p=121}} The city which was in despair was rebuilt after a visit by [[Qaitbay]] in 1477.

An [[Alawite]] community was first established in Latakia by the missionary Abu Sa'id al-Tabarani (d. 1034) in the early 11th century. From then on it spread northward and into the coastal mountain range.{{sfn|Winter|2016|p=27-28, 30-31, 53}}

===Ottoman rule===

Latakia came under the Ottoman control after the [[Battle of Marj Dabiq]] in 1516. It had a population of about 1400–1700 in the 16th century.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Winter |first=Stefan |title=Latakia (al-Lādhiqiyya), Ottoman period |url=https://www.academia.edu/40401788/Latakia_al_L%C4%81dhiqiyya_Ottoman_period |journal=Encyclopaedia of Islam III, 2019}}</ref> From the late 17th century onward it was ruled by the Ibn al-Matarji family, some of whose members would go on to become governors of [[Damascus Eyalet]].{{sfn|Winter|2010|p=107}} Under their leadership, and the development of the tobacco industry in the same period, the town developed rapidly in the 18th century. Several churches were rebuilt or restored and the [[Azm family]] of governors established several new foundations in the city. The British, French and Spanish established consulates in the city, so that by mid-century Latakia was serving as co-capital of the entire province (''eyalet'') of [[Tripoli, Lebanon]].{{sfn|Winter|2016|p=136-141}}

In 1824, the Ottomans named Muhammad Paşa ibn Alman, a native of the area who was suspected of being an [[Alawite]] and a French sympathizer, governor of Latakia. He was killed in an urban revolt later that year that was inspired by the fundamentalist shaykh Muhammad al-Moghrabi.{{sfn|Winter|2016|p=174-175, 179-181}} During the Egyptian occupation of Syria (1831–1841) there was a major [[Alawite revolt (1834-1835)]] in both the town and the surrounding countryside.{{sfn|Winter|2016|p=184-190}}

In 1888, when [[Wilaya]]t Beirut was established, Latakia became its northernmost town.<ref>Dumper, 2007, p.84</ref>

In the Ottoman period{{when|date=September 2015}}, the region of Latakia became predominantly [[Alawites|Alawi]]. The [[Syrian Turkmen|Turkmen]] also consisted a significant minority. The city itself, however, contained significant numbers of [[Sunni]] and Christian inhabitants. The landlords in the countryside tended to be Sunni and Orthodox Christians, while the peasants were mostly Alawi. Like the [[Druze]]s, who also had a special status before the end of World War I, the Alawis had a strained relationship with the Ottoman overlords. In fact, they were not even given the status of [[millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]], although they enjoyed relative autonomy.<ref name="Rabinovich">Rabinovich, 1979, p.694</ref>

===French Mandate period===
{{Main|Alawite State}}
[[File:LatakiaJulesJammalSchool.jpg|thumb|One of the oldest schools in Latakia was previous mandatory-era barracks, and later school. It was subsequently named after [[Jules Jammal]] and known ever since as the 'Jules Jammal School']]
In 1920, Latakia fell under the French mandate, under which the Alawite State was established. The state was named after the locally-dominant Alawites and became a French [[mandate territory]] after World War&nbsp;I.<ref name = "blag">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Syria.html#Alawite+Territory|title=Syria|first=Ben|last=Cahoon|website=worldstatesmen.org|access-date=27 March 2018|archive-date=17 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217235403/http://worldstatesmen.org/Syria.html#Alawite+Territory|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[French Mandate]] from the [[League of Nations]] began in 1920.<ref>Provence, Michael. "The Great Syrian Revolt and the Rise of Arab Nationalism." Austin: [[University of Texas Press]], 2005.</ref> The creation of the Alawite State, as well as the other states of Syria under the French Mandate, has often been interpreted as a "[[divide and rule]]" strategy by the French, who sought to undermine anti-colonial nationalist movements. The French justified the creation of the Alawite state by citing the "backwardness" of the mountain-dwellers, religiously distinct from the surrounding Sunni population; they claimed that the division protected the Alawi people from more-powerful Sunni majorities.<ref name="L">Longrigg, Stephen Hemsley. "Syria and Lebanon Under French Mandate." London: Oxford University Press, 1958.</ref>
[[File:Stamp Alaouites 1926 10pi air.jpg|thumb|left|A 10-piastre stamp of Syria used in the Alawite State]]
This division by the French administration in Syria did not stop Alawites such as [[Sheikh Saleh al-Ali]], who led the [[Syrian Revolt of 1919]], in continuing to protest French rule. Saleh al-Ali coordinated with the leaders of other anti-French revolts in the country, including the revolt of [[Ibrahim Hananu]] in the [[Aleppo]] countryside and [[Subhi Barakat]]'s revolt in [[Antioch]], but Saleh al-Ali's revolt was put down in 1921. A French court-martial in Latakia sentenced Shaykh Saleh to death in absentia and offered a reward of 100,000 francs for information on his whereabouts. After the French gave up trying to capturing Shaykh Saleh, a pardon was issued by General [[Henri Gouraud (general)|Henri Gouraud]].

The state became part of the Syrian Federation in 1922, but it left the federation again in 1924. In 1930, the Alawite State was renamed as the Government of Latakia, the only concession by the French to Arab nationalists until 1936.<ref name="K">Khoury, Philip S. ''Syria and the French Mandate: The Politics of Arab Nationalism, 1920–1945''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1987.</ref> On 3 December 1936, it was decided that the Alawite state would be re-incorporated into Syria as a concession by the French to the [[National Bloc (Syria)|Nationalist Bloc]], which was the ruling party of the semi-autonomous Syrian government; the decision went into effect in 1937.<ref>Shambrook, Peter A. "French Imperialism in Syria, 1927–1936." Reading: Ithaca Press, 1998.</ref>

There was a great deal of Alawite separatist sentiment in the region, but their political views could not be coordinated into a unified voice.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Khoury |first=Philip S. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/889254547 |title=Syria and the French mandate : the politics of Arab nationalism, 1920-1945 |date=1987 |isbn=978-1-4008-5839-2 |location=Princeton, New Jersey |oclc=889254547}}</ref> There was also a great deal of factionalism amongst the Alawite tribes, and the Alawite State was incorporated into Syria with little organised resistance.<ref name="K"/>

In 1942, the Latakia and Druze regions were returned to Syrian control, and by 1946, the French completely left Syria and [[Second Syrian Republic|a new independent government]] was created.

===Modern era===
[[File:Lattakia 1970.jpg|thumb|Latakia in 1970]]
All but a few classical buildings had been destroyed by the modern era, often by earthquakes; those remaining include a Roman triumphal arch and [[Corinthian column]]s known as the Colonnade of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]].<ref name="Britannica"/> However, important remains from the city at Roman and Hellenistic periods including full body statues, Roman funerary art, and column capitals that once belonged to the ancient city, now found in its national museum.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.esyria.sy/elatakia/index.php?p=stories&category=ruins&filename=200903181410064 |title=متحف "اللاذقية" الوطني الذي كان خانا للدخان...

An extensive port project was proposed in 1948, and construction work began on the [[Port of Latakia]] in 1950, aided by a [[United States dollar|US$]]6&nbsp;million loan from [[Saudi Arabia]]. By 1951, the first stage of its construction was completed, and the port handled an increasing amount of Syria's overseas trade.<ref>[http://tcc-syr.com/projectview.php?id=30 1980–1983 ''Expansion of Lattakia Harbor – Lattakia.''

In August 1957, 4,000 Egyptian troops landed in Latakia under orders from [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] after [[Turkish army|Turkish troops]] massed along the border with Syria, accusing it of harboring [[Communist Party of Turkey (historical)|Turkish Communists]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Podeh|1999|pp=43}}</ref>

A major highway linked Latakia with Aleppo and the [[Euphrates]] valley starting in 1968, supplemented by the completion of a railway line to [[Homs]]. The port became even more important after 1975 due to the troubled situation in Lebanon and the loss of Beirut and Tripoli as functioning ports.<ref name="Ring5">Ring, 1994, p.455</ref>

In 1973, during the [[Yom Kippur War|October War]] (Yom Kippur War), the naval [[Battle of Latakia]] between [[Israel]] and Syria was fought just offshore from the city. The battle was the first to be fought using [[missile]]s and [[electronic countermeasures|ECM]] (electronic countermeasures).<ref>{{Citation|last=Betts|first=Richard K.|author-link=Richard K.

On 2 September 1979 clashes broke out following the assassination of an [[Alawite]] religious leader in the city. The following day 2,000 paratroopers, commanded by [[Rifaat al-Assad]], were sent to restore order. In the violence that followed around forty people were killed including ten pilots from the Latakia air base.<ref>[[Middle East International]] No 108, 14 September 1979; [[Helena Cobban]] p.6 total killed and massacre of pilots, chronology pp.12-13 assassination and arrival of paratroopers</ref>

In 1987, the city hosted the [[1987 Mediterranean Games|tenth round]] of the [[Mediterranean Games]], with the opening ceremony hosted by [[Hafez al-Assad]] in the [[Latakia Sports City]], a sports complex designed specifically to host the games. The [[Latakia Sports City Stadium]] served as the main venue for the games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esyria.sy/elatakia/index.php?p=stories&category=places&filename=200808031135013|title=موقع اللاذقية – مدينة "الأسد" الرياضية...متنفس واسع لأهل المدينة وزوارهم|website=esyria.sy|access-date=27 March 2018|archive-date=31 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231103244/http://www.esyria.sy/elatakia/index.php?p=stories&category=places&filename=200808031135013|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1994, the city's population reached 303,000, with that number significantly rising to 383,786 by 2004.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssyr.org/new%20web%20site/General_census/census_2004/NH/TAB06-1-2004.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-06-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317032446/http://www.cbssyr.org/new%20web%20site/General_census/census_2004/NH/TAB06-1-2004.htm |archive-date=2013-03-17 }}</ref> Although population assessment in recent years has become difficult due to the ongoing civil war, the city's population is estimated to have risen drastically in the 2010s due to the influx of refugees from the cities of Aleppo, Idlib and other cities which have been affected by the ongoing war.

====Syrian Civil War====
{{anchor|civilwar}}
During the Syrian Civil War, Latakia had been a site of [[demonstration (people)|protest activity]] since March 2011. The Syrian government claimed 12 were killed there in clashes in late March,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArchiveDetails.aspx?ID=254868|agency=NOW Lebanon|date=27 March 2011|access-date=15 August 2011|title=Twelve killed in Saturday's Latakia protests, presidential adviser says|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814080339/http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArchiveDetails.aspx?ID=254868|archive-date=14 August 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> leading to the deployment of the military to restrict movement into and out of the city. Hundreds of Syrians were reportedly arrested, and by late July, activists in Latakia were telling foreign media they feared a more violent crackdown was coming.

===Port===
{{main|Port of Latakia}}
[[File:Latakia_harbour.jpg|thumb|The Port of Latakia, Syria's main harbour]]
The [[Port of Latakia]] is the main seaport in Syria. It was established on 12 February 1950, and has boosted the city's importance ever since. The port's imported cargo includes clothing, construction materials, vehicles, furniture, minerals, tobacco, cotton, and food supplies such as lintels, onions, wheat, barley, dates, grains and figs, and in 2008, the port handled about 8 million tons of cargo.

The largest area of the port, with 43 hectares, occupies the container terminal. The storage capacity is up to 17,000 containers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/SYR_Port_of_Lattakia_2257.php |title=''Port of Lattakia.''

It is not known whether the lines still exist in the [[Syrian civil war]], which has been going on since 2011.

The [[marina]] Latakia has 150 berths for ships up to a maximum length of 25 meters and 4 meters draught.<ref>[http://www.portbooker.com/en/harbour/port-of-lattaquie/latakia/latakia/syria]{{dead link|date=May 2020}}</ref> The [[Syrian Navy]] has one of four bases in Latakia.

===Agriculture===
Latakia has an extensive agricultural hinterland. Exports include bitumen ([[Bitumen|asphalt]]), cereals, [[cotton]], fruits, eggs, vegetable oil, pottery, and [[Latakia (tobacco)|tobacco]]. Cotton ginning, vegetable-oil processing, tanning, and [[sponge]] fishing serve as local industries for the city.<ref name="Britannica">[https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/331236/Latakia Latakia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129175701/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/331236/Latakia |date=2014-11-29 }}.

===Tourism===
[[File:وادي قنديل (wadi kandel ).jpg|thumb|Wadi Qandeel beach, near Latakia]]
:''The information in this section is based on potentially outdated sources, with the most recent source being published in 2004.''

The [[Cote d'Azur, Syria|Cote d'Azur]] Beach of Latakia is Syria's premier coastal resort, and offers water skiing, jet skiing, and windsurfing. The city contains eight hotels, two of which have five-star ratings; both the Cote d'Azur de Cham Hotel and Lé Meridien Lattiquie Hotel are located {{convert|6|km|mi}} north of the city, at Cote d'Azur. The latter hotel has 274 rooms and is the only international hotel in the city.<ref>Carter, 2004, p.146.</ref>

Compared to other Syrian cities, window shopping and evening strolls in the markets is considered a favorite pastime in Latakia. Numerous designer-label stores line 8 Azar Street, and the heart of the city's shopping area is the series of blocks enclosed by 8 Azar Street, Yarmouk Street, and Saad Zaghloul Street in the city center. [[Movie theater|Cinema]]s in Latakia include Ugarit Cinema, al-Kindi, and a smaller theater off al-Moutanabbi Street.<ref name="Mannheim"/>

===Festivals===
[[File:Al Mahaba Festival.jpg|thumb|Latakia Sports City during al-Mahaba Festival]]
The Al-Mahabba Festival, which includes various entertainment programs such as competitions, art parties and archeological and tourist tours to the most important places in the city and is organized by the economic and commercial authorities in cooperation with the Al-Bustan charity organization, is held annually in the city.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=2104090&language=en|title=Latakia festival kicks off with dazzling performances|publisher=Kuwait News Agency|date=2 August 2010|access-date=3 August 2022|archive-date=3 September 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220903191919/https://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=2104090&language=en|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Museums===
[[File:Latakia Museo - GAR - 2-02.jpg|thumb|left|A Roman period funerary tomb, located in the city's museum]]
The [[National Museum of Latakia]] was built in 1986 near the seafront of the city. It formerly housed the residence of the Governor of the Alawite State and was originally a 16th-century Ottoman ''[[Caravanserai|khan]]'' ("caravansary") known as Khan al-Dukhan, meaning "The ''Khan'' of Smoke", as it served the tobacco trade. The ''khan'' historically served not only as an inn, but also contained private residences.<ref name="CtS"/> The exhibits include inscribed tablets from [[Ugarit]], ancient jewellery, coins, figurines, ceramics, pottery, and early Arab and Crusader-era [[chain-mail]] suits and swords.<ref>Carter, 2008, p.146.</ref><ref>[http://www.syriagate.com/Syria/about/cities/Latakia/sites.htm Historical Sites of Latakia] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20060329184225/http://www.syriagate.com/Syria/about/cities/Latakia/sites.htm |date=2006-03-29 }} Syria Gate.</ref>

However, since the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, the museum had been temporarily closed, to protect the museum's exhibits from the trafficking and looting, which became common during recent years, that the Museums of Palmyra, Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa suffered from. However, the museum's gardens are still open to the public, and contain many column capitals, ornaments, funerary tombs and statues which still can be viewed by the public.

===Latakia tobacco===
{{Main|Latakia (tobacco)}}
Latakia tobacco is a specially prepared [[tobacco]] originally produced in Syria and named after the port city of Latakia.<ref name="glpease">{{Citation|url=http://www.glpease.com/Articles/Latakia.html|title=A Tale of Two Latakias|year=2008|publisher=G.

It is cured over a [[stone pine]] or oak wood fire, which gives it an intense smokey-peppery taste and smell. Rarely smoked straight, it is used as a "condiment" or "blender" (a basic tobacco mixed with other tobaccos to create a blend), especially in English, Balkan, and some American Classic blends.<ref name="glpease"/>

==Education==
[[File:Al-Keleyye High School - Latakia, Syria.jpg|thumb|The National Private High School, built in the [[Bauhaus]] style]]
The University of Latakia was founded in May 1971, and later renamed [[Tishreen University]] ("October University") in 1976 to commemorate the October War of 1973. The university first had only 3 faculties, Literature, Science and Agriculture and only an enrollment of 983 students during its founding,<ref name="Tishuni">{{cite web|url=http://www.tishreen.edu.sy/about|title=عن الجامعة|last=admm|date=19 June 2010|website=tishreen.edu.sy|access-date=27 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213045706/http://tishreen.edu.sy/about|archive-date=13 December 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> but that number largely grew throughout the years to reach more than 70,000 students,<ref name="Tishuni"/> making the Tishreen University the 3rd largest in Syria, with the number of its faculties rising to 17, including Medicine, Pharmacy, Dentistry, Science, Nursing, Education, Agriculture, Law, History, Electrical and Technical Engineering and Arts, among others. The city also houses a branch of the [[Arab Academy for Science and Technology and Maritime Transport]].<ref name="Britannica"/>

One of the oldest schools in Latakia, a previous military barracks built during the [[Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon]] is named after Jules Jammal, an Arab Christian military officer who blew himself up in a suicide attack on a French ship.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=3RQFAQAAIAAJ&q=Jules+Jammal AHMED FAWAZ La rencontre entre le Président et son second remonte à la fin des années quarante, sur les bancs du lycée Jules Jammal, dans la ville côtière de Lattaquié.

==Main sights==
The modern city still exhibits faint traces of its former importance, notwithstanding the frequent earthquakes with which it has been visited. The marina is built upon foundations of ancient columns, and there are in the town an old gateway and other antiquities, as also sarcophagi and sepulchral caves in the neighbourhood. This gateway is a remarkable triumphal arch at the southeast corner of the town, almost entire: it is built with four entrances, like the [[Forum Jani]] at [[Rome]]. It is conjectured that this arch was built in honour of [[Lucius Verus]], or of Septimius Severus.<ref>''Description of the East'', vol. ii. p. 197.</ref> Fragments of Greek and Latin inscriptions are dispersed all over the ruins, but entirely defaced.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ring |first=Trudy |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/871861130 |title=Middle East and Africa : International Dictionary of Historic Places. |date=2014 |publisher=Taylor and Francis |others=Noelle Watson, Paul Schellinger |isbn=978-1-134-25986-1 |location=Hoboken |pages=451 |oclc=871861130}}</ref>

Notable points of interest in the nearby area include the massive [[Saladin's Castle]] and the ruins of Ugarit, where some of the earliest [[alphabet]]ic writings have been found.
