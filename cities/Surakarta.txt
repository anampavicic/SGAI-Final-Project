Its metropolitan area, consisting of Surakarta City and the surrounding six regencies ("Greater Solo Area", formerly [[Special Region of Surakarta]]), was home to 6,837,753 inhabitants according to the official estimates for mid 2023,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024" /> 526,870 of whom reside in the city proper.

Surakarta is the birthplace of the President of Indonesia from 2014 to 2024, [[Joko Widodo]], as well as his son and current Vice President of Indonesia, [[Gibran Rakabuming Raka]]. The former served as Mayor of Surakarta from 2005 to 2012, as did the latter from 2021 to 2024.

==History==
{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2022}}
Hominid habitation in the region of Surakarta is evidenced from roughly one million years ago, the age of the "[[Java Man]]" skeleton found 80 kilometres upstream. Another famous early hominid from this area is called "[[Solo Man]]".

The Surakarta area was part of the [[Mataram Kingdom]] and at this time a village called Wulayu seems to have already existed in or around the present-day city of Surakarta, as evidenced by a ferry charter issued by [[Balitung]] in A.D. [[904]]. The [[Majapahit]] Empire renewed this ferry charter in [[1358]].<ref name="solo">{{cite journal |last1=NOORDUYN |first1=J. |title=Further Topographical Notes on the Ferry Charter of 1358: With Appendices on Djipang and Bodjanegara |journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde |date=1968 |volume=124 |issue=4 |pages=460–481 |doi=10.1163/22134379-90002863 |jstor=27860979 |s2cid=126779209 |issn=0006-2294|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Soekmono |first1=R. |title=The Javanese Candi : function and meaning |date=1995 |publisher=E.J.

By the 18th century, the village had acquired the name of Sala. This name is said to be derived from the [[Shorea robusta|sala tree]]. As the [[Javanese language|Javanese]] pronunciation "Sala" ([sɔlɔ]) was considered difficult to pronounce by the Dutch, the name later morphed into "Solo" ([solo]).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Siregar |first1=Vitrianda Hilba |title=Solo, Sala, atau Surakarta, Manakah yang Benar? |url=https://edukasi.okezone.com/read/2021/02/17/65/2363543/solo-sala-atau-surakarta-manakah-yang-benar?page=1 |access-date=22 January 2022 |work=Okezone Edukasi |date=17 February 2021 |language=id |page=1}}</ref>

In 1745, based on astrological calculations and Dutch commercial interest, Surakarta was chosen to be the new capital of the [[Mataram Sultanate]] which was on the verge of becoming a [[vassal state]] of the [[Dutch East India Company]]. The formal name is derived from the previous capital [[Kartasura]]. The official court history claims that Surakarta originally stood on a lake, which was drained by the favor of the mythical queen of the southern sea, [[Nyai Roro Kidul|Kanjeng Ratu Kidul]].

In the ensuing colonial era, the kingdom of Mataram was divided into the Surakarta Sunanate (northern court) and the Yogyakarta Sultanate (southern court). Surakarta was ruled by hereditary monarchs, who were given the unique Javanese cultural title [[Susuhunan]]. Since both Surakarta and Yogyakarta had become vassal states of the Dutch, traditional court arts, notably [[gamelan]], were developed to demonstrate cultural power instead of developing military power.

=== Pakubuwono X ===
Perhaps the most significant ruler of the 20th century was [[Pakubuwono X]]. His relationship with the Dutch, his large family, and his popularity contributed to perhaps the largest funeral procession that ever occurred in Surakarta. He had spent a large amount of money on the Royal Graveyard at [[Imogiri]], both the main sections of the graveyard and the new section where he was buried. In the era just before independence, Surakarta had European, Chinese, and Arab quarters.

===Struggle for independence===
{{See also|Special Region of Surakarta}}

After hearing the [[Indonesian Declaration of Independence|proclamation of Indonesian Independence]], [[Pakubuwono XII]] declared Surakarta a part of the Republic of Indonesia. Because of this support, President [[Sukarno]] declared Surakarta a [[Special Region of Surakarta|Special Region]] with the Susuhunan, Pakubuwono XII, continuing as governor. This terminology was also used for the [[Special Region of Yogyakarta]], which continues to be legally governed by its sultan to this day.
However, unlike Yogyakarta, Surakarta had intense, organized resistance to the continuation of the monarchy. In October 1945, a republican movement was established in Surakarta led by [[Tan Malaka]], a member of the [[Indonesian Communist Party]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Matanasi |first=Petrik |title=Penculikan Pakubuwono XII dan Dihapusnya Daerah Istimewa Surakarta |url=https://tirto.id/penculikan-pakubuwono-xii-dan-dihapusnya-daerah-istimewa-surakarta-f8aC |access-date=2023-01-29 |website=tirto.id |language=id}}</ref>
  
On 17 October, the [[vizier]] of Surakarta, KRMH [[Sosrodiningrat V]] (a member of the [[Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence|BPUPK]]), was kidnapped. The new vizier, KRMT Yudonagoro, and 9 other court officials were also kidnapped by the same movement in March 1946, including the heir to the viziership KRMTH Wuryaningrat.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mengenal Budaya Nasional "Trah Raja-raja Mataram di Tanah Jawa"|last=Joko Darmawan|publisher=Deepublish|year=2017|isbn= 9786024532413|location=Yogyakarta|pages=}}</ref>

In response, [[Prime Minister of Indonesia]] [[Sutan Syahrir]] met with Wuryaningrat and other Surakarta leaders in May and agreed to abolish the established government entirely.<ref>{{cite web |title=Current Monarch and Government |url=http://www.kerajaannusantara.com/en/surakarta-hadiningrat/current-monarch-and-administration/ |website=www.kerajaannusantara.com |publisher=Surakarta Hadiningrat Sunanate |access-date=6 March 2021}}</ref>

On 16 June 1946, the Surakarta "special region" was abolished and replaced with a regency (''kabupaten''), administered by a republican government outside the control of the Susuhunan and his court. This event is commemorated as the birthday of the city of Surakarta.<ref name=":0" />

On 26 June Prime Minister Sutan Syahrir was kidnapped in Surakarta by a rebel movement led by Major General Soedarsono, the commander of the 3rd division. President Sukarno was angry at this kidnapping and on 1 July 1946, 14 communist leaders including Tan Malaka were arrested by Indonesian police on Sukarno's instructions. However, Soedarsono freed the rebel leaders immediately. Sukarno asked the local military commander in Surakarta, Lieutenant Colonel [[Suharto]] to arrest Major General Soedarsono and the rebel group.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |date=2019-11-04 |title=Kisah Penculikan Sjahrir |url=https://historia.id/politik/articles/kisah-penculikan-sjahrir-vx2Qx |access-date=2023-01-29 |website=Historia - Majalah Sejarah Populer Pertama di Indonesia |language=id-ID}}</ref>

Suharto refused to follow this command unless it was given directly by the Military Chief of Staff, General [[Soedirman]]. Sukarno was angry at this rejection of his commanding authority and called Suharto a stubborn (''koppig'') officer.<ref name=":1" />

Suharto pretended to support the rebellion and persuaded Soedarsono and his group to stay at his headquarters at Wiyoro, Surakarta for their safety. Later that night he persuaded Soedarsono to meet President Sukarno at his palace the next morning. Suharto secretly informed the presidential guard troops about Soedarsono's plan on the next morning. On July 3, 1946, Soedarsono and his group were arrested by the presidential guard near the palace. Prime Minister Syahrir was released unharmed. Several months later, Maj. Gen. Soedarsono and his group were pardoned and released from prison.<ref>Suharto. ''Soeharto: my thoughts, words, and deeds an autobiography'' Jakarta: Citra Lamtoro Gung Persada, 1989.</ref>
 
However, this did not halt the ascendancy of the Communist Party in Surakarta. In November 1946, the communists kidnapped the regent and vice-regent and seized power for themselves, a coup quickly legitimated after the fact by Sukarno. In 1947, [[Amir Sjarifuddin]] appointed [[Wikana]], a communist, as Surakarta's military governor.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Roosa |first1=John |title=Buried histories : the anticommunist massacres of 1965-1966 in Indonesia |date=2020 |location=Madison, Wisconsin |isbn=978-0299327309 |page=124}}</ref>

In December 1948, the Dutch attacked and occupied the cities of Yogyakarta and Surakarta as part of [[Operation Kraai]]. The Indonesian Army, led by General Soedirman, started a [[guerrilla war]] in surrounding areas. The Dutch declared that the Republic had been destroyed and no longer existed. To disprove this, the Indonesian army conducted large-scale raids into the cities of Yogyakarta and Surakarta, called ''[[Serangan Oemoem]]''. On 7 August 1949, Indonesian troops led by [[Slamet Riyadi]] managed to defeat the Dutch troops and occupied the city for several hours. To   
commemorate this event, the main street of the city of Surakarta was renamed '''Brigadier General Slamet Riyadi Street'''.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-11-10 |title=Mengenal Sosok Slamet Riyadi, Tokoh Pahlawan Peristiwa Serangan Umum Surakarta |url=https://www.merdeka.com/jateng/mengenal-sosok-slamet-riyadi-tokoh-pahlawan-peristiwa-serangan-umum-surakarta.html |access-date=2023-01-29 |website=merdeka.com |language=en}}</ref>
 
Surakarta remained under communist control until October 1965. Local government was unclear about how to proceed after the [[30 September Movement]] and went about business as usual. As a result, Suharto's forces entered Surakarta without resistance, mobilized local youth paramilitaries, and indiscriminately slaughtered the entire local government.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Roosa |first1=John |title=Buried histories : the anticommunist massacres of 1965-1966 in Indonesia |date=2020 |location=Madison, Wisconsin |isbn=978-0299327309 |page=135}}</ref>

== Geography ==
The water sources for Surakarta are in the valley of Merapi, a total of 19 locations, with a capacity of 3,404 L/second (899.2 U.S. gal/sec). The average source water height is {{convert|800|–|1,200|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. In 1890–1927 there were only 12 wells in Surakarta. Today, underground water wells in 23 locations produce about 45 L/second (11.9 U.S. gal/sec).<ref name="PDAM">[https://web.archive.org/web/20200807203705/http://www.pdamsolo.or.id/download/greater_surakarta.ppt PDAM Surakarta: The Greater Surakarta]</ref>

In March 2006, Surakarta's state water company (PDAM) had a production capacity of 865.02 L/second (228.5 U.S. gal/sec): from Cokrotulung, [[Klaten]], {{convert|27|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Surakarta, 387 L/s (102.2 U.S. gal/sec); and from 26 deep wells, with a total capacity of 478.02 L/second (126.3 U.S. gal/sec). The total reservoir capacity is 9,140 m<sup>3</sup> (,414,533 U.S. gala) nd can serve 55,22% of the population.<ref>{{in lang|id}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20200807203126/http://www.pdamsolo.or.id/produksi_air.php Produksi air]</ref>

=== Climate ===
Surakarta features a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Am''). with a lengthy [[wet season]] spanning from October through May, and a relatively short dry season covering the remaining four months (June through September). On average Surakarta receives just under {{convert|2200|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rainfall annually, with its wettest months being December, January, and February. As is common in areas featuring a tropical monsoon climate, temperatures are relatively consistent throughout the year. Surakarta's average temperature is roughly 30&nbsp;°C every month (86&nbsp;°F).

Surakarta as a densely-populated core city in Central Java, and its second city, spills considerably into neighboring regencies. Surakarta City and its surrounding regencies, [[Karanganyar Regency|Karanganyar]], [[Sragen Regency|Sragen]], [[Wonogiri Regency|Wonogiri]], [[Sukoharjo Regency|Sukoharjo]], [[Klaten Regency|Klaten]], and [[Boyolali Regency|Boyolali]], are collectively called the ex-Surakarta Residency  (Dutch: ''Residentie Soerakarta'').{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

Though a traffic study quotes the population as 1,158,000 as of 2008, this reflects only the continuously built-up area, as the city affects entire neighboring regencies by significantly driving up overall population densities in [[Sukoharjo Regency]] and [[Klaten Regency]] over the already dense countryside. Furthermore, the government of Indonesia officially defines a broader region as Surakarta's extended metropolitan zone, with the acronym "Subosukawonosraten" (for '''SU'''rakarta, '''BO'''yolaki, '''SU'''koharjo, '''KA'''ranganyar, '''WONO'''giri, '''SRA'''gen, Kla'''TEN''') as the city and the entire 6 surrounding regencies,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bappenas.go.id/get-file-server/node/7642/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521175920/http://bappenas.go.id/get-file-server/node/7642/ |archive-date=May 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> which reflects a broader planning region, though not a core metropolitan area as some of its regencies are not particularly suburbanized. Both the metropolitan area and extended areas border Yogyakarta's metropolitan area, while only the extended metropolitan area borders ''Kedungsapur'' or Greater [[Semarang]].{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

== Sports ==
Surakarta has a long sport history and tradition. In 1923 Solo already had a [[football club]], one of the earliest clubs in Indonesia (at that time still the Dutch Indies), called [[Persis Solo]]. Persis Solo was a giant club in the Dutch Indies and still exists, but is past its heyday. During the [[Perserikatan]] tournament, Persis became seven-time champion. Currently it plays in the [[Liga 1 (Indonesia)|Liga 1 Indonesia]]. Other than Persis, several clubs have existed in Solo: [[Arseto Solo|Arseto]], [[Pelita Jaya|Pelita Solo]], [[Sriwijaya FC|Persijatim Solo FC]], and lastly Solo FC played in the [[Indonesian Premier League]] in 2011. Both clubs that still exist, Persis and Solo FC, have made [[Manahan Stadium]] their home ground. Manahan Stadium is one of the best sports stadiums in Central Java, with more than 25,000 seats, and has several times hosted national and international matches. It was recently the venue for the [[AFC Champions Cup]] [[2007 AFC Champions League|2007]], the final venue of the [[Indonesian Cup]] 2010, and the opening venue for the Indonesian Premiere League on January 15, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/01/08/editorial-welcome-lpi.html|title=Editorial: Welcome LPI|first=The Jakarta|last=Post}}</ref>
