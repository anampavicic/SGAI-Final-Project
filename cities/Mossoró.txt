'''Mossoró''' ({{IPA|pt|mosoˈɾɔ}}) is the second most populous city<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/cidadesat/link.php?uf=rn |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715213513/http://www.ibge.gov.br/cidadesat/link.php?uf=rn |archive-date=2010-07-15 |title=IBGE - Cidades@}}</ref> in the state of [[Rio Grande do Norte]], [[Brazil]], and also the largest municipality of that state.  It is equidistant (four hours' drive) from [[Natal, Brazil|Natal]] (approximately 277&nbsp;km or 172 miles), the state capital of Rio Grande do Norte, and from [[Fortaleza]] (approximately 260&nbsp;km or 161.5 miles), the capital of the state of [[Ceará]]. It is also in the heart of Brazil's salt production area. Situated in the Oeste Potiguar [[Mesoregion (Brazil)|mesoregion]], Mossoró is the country's largest land-based [[petroleum]] producer.<ref>[http://www.anp.gov.br/brasil-rounds/round4/round4/workshop/restrito/ingles/Potiguar_ing.pdf Workshop. Potiguar] anp.gov.br {{dead link|date=June 2023}}</ref>

==History==
To Brazilians, the main historical distinctions of the city are the driving off an attack by [[Lampião]] and his [[Social bandit|gang of "social bandits"]] (see [[Cangaço]]) that plundered entire towns in the ''[[sertão]]'' during the 1920s and 1930s; and also the fact that the city freed its slaves five years before the [[Lei Áurea]] abolished slavery in the rest of the country in 1888. Mossoró was also the first city to give women the right to vote in Brazil (Professor Celina Guimarães Viana cast the first vote in 1928), sparking a movement among other cities and states in Brazil that culminated in the [[Women's suffrage#The Americas|official recognition]] of [[women's suffrage]] by the national government in 1934.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Mossoró is one of the hottest cities in all of Brazil. It has [[semi-arid climate]] with a temperature range of mean lows around {{convert|22.7|°C|°F|abbr=on}} and mean highs around {{convert|33.4|°C|°F|abbr=on}} throughout the year.<ref name="ClimateCharts_MossoróRN">{{cite web|url=http://www.climate-charts.com/Locations/b/BZ82591.php|title=Mossoro, Brazil: Climate, Global Warming, and Daylight Charts and Data|publisher=Climate Charts|accessdate=September 8, 2014|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20140605151120/http://www.climate-charts.com/Locations/b/BZ82591.php|archivedate=June 5, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, it is not uncommon for temperatures to exceed {{convert|35|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}} throughout the year, with temperatures approaching {{convert|45|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}} unexceptional. The sultriest temperatures are registered from October to January.
