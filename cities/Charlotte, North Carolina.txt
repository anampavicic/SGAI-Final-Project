==History==
{{For timeline}}
===Early history===
[[File:Queen-charlotte-1744-1818.jpg|thumb|upright|The city's namesake, [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], Queen of Great Britain and Ireland, {{circa|1779}}|left]]
The [[Catawba people|Catawba Indians]] were the first known historic tribe to settle Mecklenburg County in the Charlotte area and were first recorded around 1567, according to  Spanish records.

===18th century===
By 1759, half the Catawba tribe had died from [[smallpox]], an endemic disease among European colonists, which the Catawba had no natural [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] against. At the time of their largest population, the Catawba population was 10,000. But by 1826, the Catawba population dropped to 110.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clclt.com/theclog/archives/2012/12/21/question-the-queen-city-who-were-the-native-americans-that-lived-here-before-charlotte-was-colonized|title=Question the Queen City: Who were the Native Americans that lived here before Charlotte was colonized?|website=Creative Loafing Charlotte|access-date=April 11, 2016}}</ref>

The city of Charlotte was developed first by a wave of migration of [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], or [[Ulster-Scot]] settlers from [[Ulster]], who dominated the culture of the Southern Piedmont Region and made up the principal founding population in the backcountry. [[German Americans|German immigrants]] also settled in the area before the [[American Revolutionary War]], but in smaller numbers. They still contributed greatly to the early foundations of the region.

Mecklenburg County was initially part of [[Bath County, North Carolina|Bath County]] (1696 to 1729) of the New Hanover Precinct, which became [[New Hanover County]] in 1729. The western portion of New Hanover split into [[Bladen County, North Carolina|Bladen County]] in 1734, and its western portion split into [[Anson County]] in 1750. Mecklenburg County was formed from Anson County in 1762. Further apportionment was made in 1792, after the American Revolutionary War, with [[Cabarrus County]] formed from Mecklenburg.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/mecklenburg-county-1762/|title=Mecklenburg County (1762)|publisher=North Carolina History Project|access-date=June 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200626074059/https://northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/mecklenburg-county-1762/|archive-date=June 26, 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1842, [[Union County, North Carolina|Union County]] formed from Mecklenburg's southeastern portion and a western portion of Anson County.

The area that is now Charlotte was first settled by European colonists around 1755 when Thomas Spratt and his family settled near what is now the Elizabeth neighborhood. [[Thomas Polk]] (great-uncle of [[President of the United States|President]] [[James K. Polk]]), who later married Thomas Spratt's daughter, built his house by the intersection of two [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] trading paths between the [[Yadkin River|Yadkin]] and [[Catawba River|Catawba]] rivers.<ref name="Story1">{{cite web| url = http://www.cmstory.org/content/1755-founding-new-city| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150518112246/http://www.cmstory.org/content/1755-founding-new-city| archive-date = May 18, 2015| title = The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Story: History Timeline: Founding a New City| work = cmstory.org Web Site | publisher = Public Library of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County| access-date = September 25, 2015}}</ref> One path ran north–south and was part of the [[Great Wagon Road]]; the second path ran east–west along what is now Trade Street.

Local leaders came together in 1775 and signed the [[Mecklenburg Resolves]], more popularly known as the [[Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence]]. While not a true declaration of independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] rule, it is among the first such declarations that eventually led to the [[American Revolution]]. May 20, the traditional date of the signing of the declaration, is celebrated annually in Charlotte as "MecDec", with musket and cannon fire by reenactors in Independence Square. North Carolina's [[Flag of North Carolina|state flag]] and [[Seal of North Carolina|state seal]] also bear the date.

Charlotte is traditionally considered the home of Southern [[Presbyterianism]], but in the 19th&nbsp;century, numerous churches, including Presbyterian, [[Baptist]], [[Methodist]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]], [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], and [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] formed, eventually giving Charlotte the nickname, "[[City of Churches|The City of Churches]]".<ref name="Story40">{{cite web

The city's first boom came after the Civil War, as Charlotte became a cotton processing center and railroad hub. By the 1880s, Charlotte sat astride the Southern Railway mainline from [[Atlanta]] to [[Washington, D.C.]] Farmers from miles around would bring cotton to the railroad platform in Uptown. Local promotors began building textile factories, starting with the 1881 Charlotte Cotton Mill that still stands at Graham and 5th streets.<ref>[https://www.charlottesgotalot.com/articles/history/the-history-of-charlotte The History of Charlotte, NC].

The urban section of [[Little Sugar Creek Greenway]] was completed in 2012.

===Climate===
Like much of the Piedmont region of the southeastern United States, Charlotte has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), with four distinct seasons. Charlotte is part of USDA [[hardiness zone]] 8a, transitioning to 7b in the suburbs in all directions except the south.<ref>{{cite web|title=USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map|url=http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|access-date=June 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227032333/http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/|archive-date=February 27, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The following narrative reflects 1991–2020 climate data. Winters are short and fairly mild, with a normal January daily mean temperature of {{convert|42.1|°F|1}}. On occasion the temperature can fall below {{convert|20|°F|1}} but Charlotte also enjoys multiple warm winter days in excess of {{convert|65|°F|1}}.<ref name = "NWS Greenville-Spartanburg, SC (GSP)"/> On average, there are 59 nights per year that drop to or below freezing, and only 1.5 days that fail to rise above freezing.<ref name = "NWS Greenville-Spartanburg, SC (GSP)"/> 

Precipitation is evenly distributed through the year. Only August stands out as a slightly wetter month, averaging 4.35 inches of rainfall. Summers are hot and humid, with a normal July daily mean temperature of {{convert|80.1|°F|1}}.<ref name="NCDC txt KCLT"/> Hot and humid days can arrive as early as May and last to the end of September. There is an average of 44 days per year with highs at or above {{convert|90|°F|0}}.<ref name = "NWS Greenville-Spartanburg, SC (GSP)"/> Official record temperatures range from {{convert|104|°F|0}} recorded six times, most recently from [[Summer 2012 North American heat wave|June 29 to July 1, 2012]], down to {{convert|-5|°F|0}} recorded on [[January 1985 Arctic outbreak|January 21, 1985]], the most recent of three occasions.

Charlotte is directly in the path of subtropical moisture from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] as it heads up the eastern seaboard, thus the city receives ample precipitation throughout the year but also many clear, sunny days. Precipitation is generally less frequent in autumn than in spring.<ref name="NWS Greenville-Spartanburg, SC (GSP)"/> On average, Charlotte receives {{convert|43.60|in|mm|sigfig=3}} of precipitation annually, evenly distributed throughout the year.

There is an average of {{convert|3.5|in|cm|1}} of snow, mainly in January and February and rarely December or March, with more frequent ice storms and sleet mixed in with rain. Seasonal snowfall has historically ranged from trace amounts in 2011–12 to {{convert|22.6|in|cm|abbr=on}} in 1959–60.<ref name="NWS Greenville-Spartanburg, SC (GSP)"/> Snow and ice storms can have a major impact on the area, as they often pull tree limbs down onto power lines and make driving hazardous.

==Government==
Charlotte has a [[council–manager]] form of government. The [[Mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina|mayor]] and [[Charlotte City Council]] are elected every two years, with no [[term limit]]s. The mayor is ''ex&nbsp;officio'' chair of the City Council, and only votes in case of a tie. Unlike other mayors in council–manager systems, Charlotte's mayor has the power to [[Veto power in the United States#In local government|veto]] [[local ordinance|ordinances]] passed by the council; the council can override a mayoral veto by a vote of seven of its ten members.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://library.municode.com/nc/charlotte/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTICH_CH3GOBO_S3.23QUPRVO | access-date = 2022-06-26 | title = Sec. 3.23. - Quorum; procedure; voting. | work = Code of Ordinances City of Charlotte, North Carolina - Part I: Charter | publisher = Municode}}</ref> The Council appoints a [[city manager]] to serve as chief administrative officer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://charlottenc.gov/CityCouncil/Pages/default.aspx|title=About Charlotte City Council|website=CharlotteNC.gov|access-date=October 11, 2021}}</ref>

The Charlotte City Council has 11 members (7 from districts and 4 [[at-large]]). Democrats control the council with a 9-to-2 advantage, winning all 4 of the at-large seats in the November 2013, 2015, and 2017 municipal elections. While the City Council is responsible for passing ordinances, the city's budget, and other policies, all decisions can be overridden by the [[North Carolina General Assembly]], since North Carolina municipalities do not have [[Municipal home rule|home rule]]. While municipal powers have been broadly construed since the 1960s, the General Assembly still retains considerable authority over local matters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cmstory.org/exhibits/hornets-nest-book-two/city-government-charlotte|title=City Government in Charlotte|website=cmstory.org|access-date=October 5, 2017}}</ref>

{{Main article|Charlotte Area Transit System}}
[[File:LynxBlandStreet.jpg|thumb|The [[Lynx Blue Line|Blue Line's]] Bland Street Station in Charlotte's South End neighborhood]]
The [[Charlotte Area Transit System]] (CATS) is the agency responsible for operating mass transit in the Charlotte metropolitan area, carrying over 16 million riders annually. Established in 1999 and administered as a department of the city of Charlotte, CATS operates [[light rail]] transit, [[streetcar]], [[commuter bus|express buses]], [[transit bus|local buses]], and special bus services serving Charlotte and the surrounding area in addition to other programs such as [[vanpool]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://charlottenc.gov/cats/Pages/default.aspx|title=Charlotte Area Transit System|website=Charlottenc.gov|access-date=May 21, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/local/cats-charlotte-area-transit-system-next-phase-transportation-system/275-f1ee49d6-fad3-4857-acb7-3ac555a8369a|title=CATS finalizing design for new transportation system|last=Pierre|first=Jesse|date=November 7, 2022|website=WCNC.com|access-date=August 9, 2023}}</ref>

CATS' rail arm, LYNX Rapid Transit Services, comprises two lines as of fall 2020. The Blue Line is an 18.9‑mile line north–south light rail line running through [[South End (Charlotte neighborhood)|South End]], [[Uptown Charlotte|Center City]], [[NoDa]], and [[University City (Charlotte neighborhood)|University City]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://charlottenc.gov/cats/rail/lynx-blue-line/Pages/default.aspx|title=Lynx Blue Line – City of Charlotte City Council|website=Charlottenc.gov|access-date=June 11, 2022|archive-date=September 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190901084125/https://charlottenc.gov/cats/rail/lynx-blue-line/Pages/default.aspx|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[CityLYNX Gold Line]] streetcar, Phase 1 of which opened in 2015, is under Phase 2 construction as of fall 2020.

The bulk of CATS ridership is derived from its extensive bus network, which has its main hub at the Charlotte Transportation Center in Uptown, which also connects to the Blue and Gold lines. Other bus hubs are located at community transit centers in SouthPark, Eastland, and at Rosa Parks Place. CATS operates express buses to outlying parts of the city and some commuter bus to the northern suburbs in the Lake Norman area under the MetroRAPID umbrella.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrdc.org/stories/charlotte-its-way-becoming-modern-transit-hub|title=Charlotte is on its way to becoming a modern transit hub|last=Helmer|first=Jodi|date=December 11, 2019|website=NRDC.org|access-date=December 11, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article266375306.html|title=Underground?
