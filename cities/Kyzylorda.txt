'''Kyzylorda''' ({{langx|kk|Қызылорда / Qyzylorda}} {{IPA|kk|qəˌzəɫorˈdɑ|}} {{Pronunciation|Kk-kyzylorda.ogg|listen|(|help=no}}), formerly known as '''Kzyl-Orda''' ({{langx|ru|Кзыл-Орда}}), '''Ak-Mechet''' (Ак-Мечеть), '''Perovsk''' (Перовск), '''Leninsk''' (Ленинск), and '''Fort-Perovsky''' (Форт-Перовский), is a city in south-central [[Kazakhstan]], capital of [[Kyzylorda Region]] and former capital of the [[Kazakh ASSR]] from 1925 to 1927.

The city has a population of 242,462 (2020 Census). It historically developed around the [[Syr Darya]] river and was the site of a [[Khanate of Kokand|Kokand]] fortress. The population of the city with nearby villages is 312,861 (2020 Census).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://stat.gov.kz/api/getFile/?docId=ESTAT354434 |title=Демографиялық статистика | language=kk |access-date=October 26, 2020 |archive-date=May 27, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200527215506/https://stat.gov.kz/api/getFile/?docId=ESTAT354434 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==History==
A settlement existed under [[Seljuk (warlord)|Seljuk]], the founder of the Seljuk dynasty. The modern city began in 1817<ref>Valikhanof et al, The Russians in Central Asia, 1865, page 315, says " according to Kirgiz accounts, about the year 1817." Kirgiz meant Kazakh at that time.</ref> as the site of a [[Khanate of Kokand|Kokand]] fortress known as '''Ak-Mechet''', or ''white mosque''.<ref name="Pospelov">Pospelov, p.&nbsp;24</ref> The later-famous [[Yakub Beg of Yettishar|Yaqub Beg]] was once the fort's commander, but he was not in command during the final battle. In 1853, during the [[Russian conquest of Turkestan]], the fort was taken by Russian troops under General [[Vasily Perovsky]].<ref name="Pospelov" /> The Russians established a new fort and called it '''Fort-Perovsky''' ({{lang|ru|Форт-Перо́вский}}), after the general.

The town of '''Perovsk''' ({{lang|ru|Перо́вск}}) in [[Russian Turkestan]] later developed around the fort.<ref name="Pospelov" /> In 1925, the city was renamed Kzyl-Orda ({{lang|ru|Кзыл-Орда}})<ref name="Pospelov" /> and was designated as the capital of the [[Kazak ASSR]]. The name means ''a red city'', from the Turkic "кзыл" (''red''; used here in the common [[Soviet Union–United States relations|Soviet]] ideological connotation) and the Turkic Mongolian "орда" (''city'').<ref name="Pospelov" /> In 1927 the capital was relocated to the southeastern region and [[Almaty|Alma-Ata]].

''"Kyzylorda",'' the Kazakh-based Romanized spelling, has been used since the late 20th century after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and [[Kazakhstan]]'s independence in 1991.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Since independence, many of the [[outhouse]]s were erected in several apartment buildings used as dormitories during Soviet rule due to a lack of sewage systems for [[indoor plumbing]]. A ''[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|RFE/RL]]'' report in April 2018 stated that the [[Government of Kazakhstan|Kazakh Republic government]] was planning to modernize Soviet-era buildings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/kazakhstan-infrastructure-plumbing/29150171.html|title = Toilet Trouble in Kazakhstan| date=April 6, 2018 }}</ref>
