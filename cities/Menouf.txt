'''Menouf''' ({{langx|ar|منوف}}, from {{Langx|cop|ⲡⲁⲛⲟⲩϥ}}) is a city in [[Egypt]] located in the Nile Delta.<ref name="monofeya.gov">{{cite web |title=About Menouf |url=http://www.monofeya.gov.eg/HaykalTanzemy/cities/monof/default.aspx |website=monofeya.gov |access-date=2018-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180222002132/http://www.monofeya.gov.eg/HaykalTanzemy/cities/monof/default.aspx# |archive-date=2018-02-22 |url-status=live }}</ref> It has an area of 18.76 square kilometers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.monofeya.gov.eg/HaykalTanzemy/cities/monof/disp_hawla_markaz.aspx?ID=1# |title=الصفحة الرئيسية - منوف |access-date=2012-01-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424031312/http://www.monofeya.gov.eg/HaykalTanzemy/cities/monof/disp_hawla_markaz.aspx?ID=1# |archive-date=2014-04-24 |url-status=live }}</ref> The city gave name to the [[Monufia Governorate]] that it is located in and it was the capital of the governorate until [[1826]]. Menouf is one of the several continually inhabited [[ancient Egypt]]ian cities in the governorate.

== Name ==
Menouf was formerly called ''Minuf al-Ulyah (''{{Langx|ar|منوف العليا|lit=the upper Menouf}}),<ref name="Minuf Al-'Ulyah">{{cite web |last1=Stewart |first1=Randall |title=Minuf Al-'Ulyah |url=http://ccdl.libraries.claremont.edu/cdm/ref/collection/cce/id/1358 |accessdate=10 July 2020 |website=Claremont Colleges Digital Library}}</ref> which comes from {{Langx|cop|ⲡⲁⲛⲟⲩϥ ⲣⲏⲥ|lit=southern Panouf}} (with variants ⲉⲛⲟⲩϥⲓ ⲣⲏⲥ and ⲁⲛⲟⲩϥⲉ). "The upper" in this case also means "southern", i.e. located upriver in relation to the [[Nile]]'s flow (see [[Upper Egypt]]), which was used to differentiate it from Minuf as-Sufli ({{Langx|ar|منوف السفلي|lit=the lower Minuf}}, {{Langx|cop|ⲡⲁⲛⲟⲩϥ ϧⲏⲧ|lit=northern Panouf}}),<ref name=":02">{{Cite web |last=Peust |first=Carsten |title=Die Toponyme vorarabischen Ursprungs im modernen Ägypten |url=http://www.peust.de/ortsnamen_original.pdf |page=65}}</ref> modern [[Mahallat Menouf]].

The Coptic name Panouf in turn is derived from {{Langx|egy|pꜣ-jw-nfr|lit=the good island}}. The city's [[Greek language|Greek]] name Onouphis ({{Langx|grc|Ὀνουφις}}) comes from the Egyptian name as well.<ref name=":02" />

== History ==
Panouf was a [[Diocese|bishopric]] by the middle of the fourth century as evidenced by the attendance of Bishop Adelphis of Onouphis at a [[Councils of Alexandria|synod in Alexandria]] in [[362]].

During the [[Heraclian revolt|Heraclean revolt]] the city was an important center of [[Chariot racing|the Blues]], loyal to the emperor [[Phocas]]. General Bonasus gave battle to the rebels east of Panouf and defeated them, but the city was captured by [[Nicetas (cousin of Heraclius)|Nicetas]] in a short while.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Howard-Johnston |first=James |title=The Last Great War of Antiquity |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2021 |isbn=978-0-19-883019-1 |pages=38–58}}</ref>

By the 19th century the city went into decline. It had no gardens, its streets were narrow and dirty, and its houses small and badly constructed. The people drank the Nile water.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mitchell |first=John Kearsley |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=949PAAAAYAAJ&dq=Menouf&pg=PA20 |title=On the Cryptogamous Origin of Malarious and Epidemic Fevers |date=1849 |publisher=Lea and Blanchard |language=en}}</ref>
