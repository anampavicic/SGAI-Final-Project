Annaba is a coastal city that underwent significant growth during the 20th century. Annaba has a metropolitan area with a higher population density than the other metropolitan areas of the Algerian coastline, such as [[Oran]] and [[Algiers]]. Much of eastern and southern Algeria uses the services, equipment and infrastructure of Annaba. Economically, it is the centre for various economic activities, such as industry, transportation, finance, and tourism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anvredet.org.dz/Annaba.pdf|title=ANVREDET|access-date=31 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216105118/http://www.anvredet.org.dz/Annaba.pdf|archive-date=16 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Names==
Present-day Annaba grew up on the site of '''Aphrodisium''', the [[seaport]] of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] city {{nowrap|'''[[Hippo Regius]]'''}}.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} (The modern city has since expanded south over Hippo's ruins as well.) Its former names '''Bône'''{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} and '''Bona'''{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} derived from "Ubbo", a local form of the name Hippo.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} Its informal name "Land of the [[Jujube]]s" ({{lang|ar|بلد العناب}}, ''Balad al-‘Unnāb'') derives from that abundance of that fruit in the region.

=== Ancient ===
The area of Annaba has yielded evidence of very early human occupation at Ain el Hanech, near Saïda (circa 200,000 BC), including artifacts that show remarkable toolmaking craftsmanship. According to some sources, [[prehistory|prehistoric]] Algeria was the site of the most advanced development of flake-tool techniques in the Middle Early Stone Age (Middle [[Paleolithic]]).

The town of Hippo Regius (modern Annaba) first entered historical records at the end of the 3rd century BCE as a possession of Massinissa's Numidian Kingdom.<ref>{{cite book | chapter-url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781444338386.wbeah16069?cookieSet=1 | doi=10.1002/9781444338386.wbeah16069 | chapter=Hippo Regius | title=The Encyclopedia of Ancient History | year=2012 | last1=Rossiter | first1=Jeremy | isbn=9781444338386 }}</ref> [[Augustine of Hippo]] was bishop here from 396 AD until his death in 430 AD.<ref>{{cite book |quote=A Berber, born in 354 AD at Thagaste (now Souk-Ahras) in Africa, he died as the Bishop of Hippo (later Bona, then Bône, and now Annaba) in 430 AD, while the [[Vandals]] were besieging the town. |author-link=Fernand Braudel |first=Fernand |last=Braudel |title=A history of civilizations |orig-year=1963 |location=New York |publisher=Penguin Books |year=1995 |page=335 |isbn=0-14-012489-6 }}</ref> The city was destroyed in the 5th century by the [[Vandals]].<ref name="WDL"/> Vandals ruled the city for roughly a century until 534.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q04qPNZasbIC&pg=PA87|title=Framing the Early Middle Ages: Europe and the Mediterranean, 400-800|last=Wickham|first=Chris|date=2005-09-22|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191532610|page=87|language=en}}</ref> Gelimer, the King of the Vandals and Alans from 530 to 534 AD, faced with the starvation of his followers and their children, and realizing he had no chance of regaining his kingdom of North Africa, surrendered to Flavius [[Belisarius]], a general of the Byzantine Empire under Justinian I, at Bône.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Go9BAAAAcAAJ&q=Mons+Pappua+on+the+border+of+Numidia&pg=PA96|title=A System of Geography, Ancient and Modern: In 6 Volumes|first=James|last=Playfair|date=1 January 1814|publisher=Hill|access-date=31 December 2016}}</ref> [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] then ruled Hippona (Hippo's renamed name after 395) before the [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|Muslim conquest of the Maghreb]] in 699 AD. Later, [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]], [[Aghlabids]], and [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]] ruled Bona before the rise of the [[Zirid dynasty|Zirids]]. It was relocated to its present place after flooding and [[Banu Hilal]] the ravages that occurred in 1033 during [[Hammadid]] rule. It was attacked by a [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]]n fleet in 1034 and was conquered by [[Kingdom of Sicily]] in 1153. The [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] took it in 1160.

During the 11th century, the [[Banu Hilal]], an [[Arab]] tribe living between the [[Nile]] and the [[Red Sea]], settled in [[Tunisia]], [[History of Islamic Tripolitania and Cyrenaica|Tripolitania]] (western [[Libya]]) and [[Constantinois]] (eastern [[Algeria]]) which was the portion known as Annaba.

After the demise of the Almohads, the rule of the [[Hafsid dynasty|Hafsids]] began in Annaba in 1250. Hafsid rule was interrupted by brief occupations of the [[Marinid dynasty|Marinids]] and [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] (in 1360) and ended with that of the [[Zayyanid dynasty|Zayyanids]]. Rule by the [[Ottoman Empire]] began in 1533, and that lasted until French occupation in 1832, excepting rule by the [[Spanish Empire]] between 1535 and 1540. The [[Barbary pirate]]s also lived in Annaba from the 16th through 19th centuries.<ref name="WDL"/>

=== Modern ===
During the rule of France (empire and republics), this city was called Bône. It was one of the main French settlements, and it still has a sizeable minority of the "[[Pied-Noir]]". One notable pied-noir from Bône was General [[Alphonse Juin]], a [[Marshal of France]] and then the Central European [[NATO]] Commander.

Construction was undertaken at Bône during 1856–69 to build an {{convert|80|ha|adj=on}} sheltered port to handle the iron ore from the [[Mokta el Hadid]].{{sfn|Prochaska|2002|p=111}}
A short railroad line was built from the [[mining|iron ore mine]] at Ain Mokra to the docks of Bône.{{sfn|Prochaska|2002|p=109}} This railway was opened in 1864, the first one to be built in Algeria.{{sfn|Levainville|1924|p=165}} Full-scale production or iron ore began in 1865.{{sfn|Passaqui|2013|p=3}} Also in 1865, Emperor [[Napoleon III]] visited Algeria, including going to the mine and the city of Bône.{{sfn|Prochaska|2002|p=81}}

In 1865, the mine produced 22,000 tonnes of iron ore, which increased to 255,000 tonnes in 1869. The ore was extracted from underground galleries, and then shipped from Bône to the French iron and steel works.{{sfn|Iron and Steel Institute|1880|p=252}} Before the mine was opened, Bône had just 10,000 inhabitants. By 1924, there were 41,000 people, and the port was being used to export phosphates, lead ore, and zinc ore, too.{{sfn|Levainville|1924|p=164}}

During [[World War II]] in 1943, Bône was an important goal of the [[U.S. Army]] and [[British Army]] in [[Operation Torch]], advancing eastward from [[Morocco]], [[Oran]], and [[Algiers]] across North Africa. Bône was a crucial highway and sea location for the invasion of Tunisia, and thence the driving of the [[Axis Powers]] (Germany and Italy) out of Africa in May 1943.

Bône remained in Allied hands until the end of the war in 1945, and then it remained a part of [[French Algeria]] until the independence of Algeria in 1962.

==Urban areas==
The metropolitan area includes the cities of El Bouni, El Hadjar and Sidi Amar, which now form a circle around the city of Annaba. The city has grown dramatically since a major factory was opened at El Hadjar ({{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the South) and provides employment for the entire region.

The downtown district of Annaba is on the sea-front, and includes the promenade called the Concours de la Revolution (previously called Le Cours Bertagna) which is a lively area, brimming with arcades and all kinds of covered restaurants, terraced cafes and kiosks. Annaba also has an international airport.

Annaba is an important centre for tourism, and is one of the major tourist attractions in the western Mediterranean. It is a coastal city with mountains, hills, foothills, and plains surrounding it. Due to this, and aside from maritime and seaside tourism, Annaba has a key potential for mountain tourism. The mountains around Seraïdi which rise to {{convert|1080|m|ft}}, make them a major tourist attraction. Other tourist attractions are ''West Bay'', ''Djenane el Bey'' (La Grande Plage), ''Ras el Hamra'' and ''Ain Achir'' beach.

Annaba also has various key religious sites, including the [[Saint Augustin Basilica]]. Annaba in its early history, was the site of an important and influential [[Diocese]], prior to its destruction by the Vandals, and the era of Islamisation. Annaba is located on the Tunisian border, and is a visa-free area, hence tourists are also able to make side trips to Tunisia and to [[El Kala National Park]].

Annaba is also known for its verdant Main Street (more often known as the Concours de la Revolution), which is a bustling promenade also well known for its night-life. The Annaba area is generally reputed for having scenic beaches, hotels and a bustling nightlife.
