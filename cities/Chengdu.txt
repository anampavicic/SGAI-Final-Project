Archaeological discoveries at the [[Sanxingdui]] and [[Jinsha site|Jinsha Site]] have established that the area surrounding Chengdu was inhabited over four thousand years ago, in the 18th–10th century{{nbsp}}BC. At the time of China's [[Xia dynasty|Xia]], [[Shang dynasty|Shang]], and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] [[list of Chinese dynasties|dynasties]], it represented a separate ancient [[Bronze Age|bronze-wielding]] culture that, following its partial [[sinification]], became known to the Chinese as [[Shu (kingdom)|Shu]].<ref name="sage1">{{cite book|last=Sage|first=Steven F.|title=Ancient Sichuan and the unification of China|year=1992|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=0791410374|page=16|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/20359334?selectedversion=NBD8161066|access-date=12 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004235754/http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/20359334?selectedversion=NBD8161066|archive-date=4 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="yinkedeng">{{Cite book |last = Liang |first = Deng |author2=Martha Avery |author3=Yue Pan|title = History of China | publisher = [[:zh:五洲传播出版社|China Intercontinental Press]] |year = 2001 |page = 171 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lFRVNTo77vEC |isbn = 7-5085-1098-4 |author-mask=Liang Deng |display-authors=1}}</ref> Shu was conquered by [[Qin (state)|Qin]] in 316{{nbsp}}BC, and the settlement was re-founded by Qin general [[Zhang Yi (strategist)|Zhang Yi]].

==== Pre-Qin to Qin and Han dynasties ====
In the early stage of the [[Xia dynasty]] or even earlier, the ancient Shu Kingdom located on the Chengdu Plain has formed a relatively developed bronze civilization, becoming an important source of Chinese civilization and one of the birthplaces of the Chinese nation. According to records, there were five dynasties in the ancient Shu Kingdom, and their capitals were Qushang (now Wenjiang District, Chengdu), Piyi (now Pidu District), Xindu, and Guangdu. At the end of the Spring and Autumn period (around the 4th century BC), the fifth King Kaiming moved the capital to Chengdu. According to "Taiping Huanyu Ji," the name of the city is borrowed from the history of the establishment of the capital in the Western Zhou dynasty. The allusions of Zhou Wang Qianqi's "one year, he lived in a cluster, two years became a city, and three years Chengdu," because of the name Chengdu, it has been used to this day. Therefore, Chengdu has become a rare city in China and the world that has not changed its name since its establishment. Some people think that Chengdu is a transliteration of ancient Shu place names. There is a saying that "Guangdu, Xindu and Chengdu" are collectively referred to as the "Three Capitals of Ancient Shu." Nowadays, there are many cultural relics of ancient Shu Kingdom in Chengdu Plain, such as Sanxingdui Ruins, Jinsha Ruins, Yufu Ancient City Ruins, Wangcong Temple, etc. Jinsha Ruins located in the urban area of Chengdu is a peak of the development of ancient Shu culture.<ref>{{cite book |title=《成都市志·大事记》 |date=2010-12-01 |publisher=方志出版社 |isbn=978-7-80238-977-9 |pages=605–607}}</ref><ref>《史记·五帝本纪》：“一年而所居成聚，二年成邑，三年成都。”</ref><ref>《华阳国志·蜀志》：「蜀以成都、新都、广都为三都」</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=金沙简介 |url=http://www.jinshasitemuseum.com/About/Introduction |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210118075827/http://www.jinshasitemuseum.com/About/Introduction |archive-date=2021-01-18 |accessdate=2018-09-30 |website=成都金沙遗址博物馆}}</ref>

The ancient state of Shu was the first target to be conquered by the Qin state in the process of unifying the world. King Huiwen of Qin had prepared for this for many years, and opened up the Shiniu Road (that is, the Jinniu Road) from Qin to Shu. In 316 BC, King Huiwen of Qin took advantage of the mutual attack between Ba and Shu, and sent Sima Cuo to lead his army into Shu along the Shiniu Road, and they captured the land in a few months. After that, the king of Qin established three abolitions of Shu Hou, and finally established Shu County, and the county seat of Chengdu County was established in Chengdu, the former capital of Shu. In 311 BC, Zhang Yi of the Qin dynasty built the Chengdu city wall according to the system of the capital Xianyang, and built a large city and a small city. In 256 BC, King Zhao of Qin appointed Li Bing as the governor of Shu County. During his tenure, he presided over the construction of the world-famous Dujiangyan Water Conservancy Project. The Chengdu Plain has been fertile and wild for thousands of miles since then. After decades of operation, Chengdu replaced Guanzhong Plain in the late Qin dynasty and was called the "Land of Abundance," and this reputation has continued to this day.<ref>{{cite news |date=2016-08-10 |title=白马关金牛古蜀道 石牛粪金起五丁开道成 |url=http://epaper.scdaily.cn/shtml/scrb/20160810/139442.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210118075847/https://epaper.scdaily.cn/shtml/scrb/20160810/139442.shtml |archive-date=2021-01-18 |accessdate=2018-10-01 |work=四川日报}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=華陽國志 (四庫全書本)/卷03 |url=https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E8%8F%AF%E9%99%BD%E5%9C%8B%E5%BF%97_(%E5%9B%9B%E5%BA%AB%E5%85%A8%E6%9B%B8%E6%9C%AC)/%E5%8D%B703 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210619164334/https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E8%8F%AF%E9%99%BD%E5%9C%8B%E5%BF%97_(%E5%9B%9B%E5%BA%AB%E5%85%A8%E6%9B%B8%E6%9C%AC)/%E5%8D%B703 |archive-date=2021-06-19 |access-date=2022-06-25 |website=维基文库，自由的图书馆 |language=zh}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author= |date=2016 |title=成都地区在南北朝佛教史上的重要地位 |url=http://www.fx361.com/page/2017/0103/469223.shtml |journal=《看历史》 |location=成都 |issue=11 |pages= |issn=2095-0853 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210117081039/http://www.fx361.com/page/2017/0103/469223.shtml |archive-date=2021-01-17 |access-date=2017-09-21 |id=51-1732/K |url-status=live}}</ref>

During the Han dynasty, the Chengdu economy, especially its brocade industry, prospered, becoming an important source of tribute to the court. The imperial court invested in Chengdu and specially set up Jinguan management and built "Jinguan City" in the southwest of Chengdu, "Jinguan City" and "Jincheng" becoming nicknames for Chengdu. In the second year of Emperor Ping of the Yuan dynasty, the population of Chengdu reached 76,000 households, or about 354,000 people, making it one of the most populous cities at that time. Towards the six major cities. In the third year of the reign of Emperor Jing of the Han dynasty (141 BC), the Wen Dang, the prefect of Shu County, established the world's earliest local government-run school, "Wenweng Shishi," in Chengdu. In the Han dynasty, Chengdu's literature and art also reached a high level. All the most famous literary masters in the Han dynasty were from Chengdu, including Sima Xiangru, Yang Xiong, and Wang Bao.<ref>《汉书·食货志下》：「遂於长安及五都立五均官，更名长安 东西市令及洛阳、邯郸、临淄、宛、成都市长皆为五均司市师。」</ref><ref name="认识成都历史沿革">{{cite web |title=认识成都 - 历史沿革 |url=http://www.chengdu.gov.cn/cd_know/detail.jsp?id=273934 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816045846/http://www.chengdu.gov.cn/cd_know/detail.jsp?id=273934 |archivedate=2014-08-16 |accessdate=2015-04-30 |website=成都市人民政府}}</ref>

In the former Han dynasty, the whole country was divided into 14 prefectural governors' departments, among which the Yizhou governor was established in Luoxian (now Guanghan City, Sichuan), and the governor later moved to Chengdu. In the first year of Emperor Guangwu's reign (25 years) in the Eastern Han dynasty, Gongsun Shu established himself as the emperor in Chengdu, and the country's name was "married family." In the twelfth year of Jianwu in the Later Han dynasty (36 years), the Great Sima Wuhan of the Eastern Han dynasty finally captured Chengdu after five years of war, and his family perished. In the fifth year of Zhongping (188), Emperor Ling of Han, the court accepted Liu Yan's suggestion and changed the provincial governors to state shepherds with actual recruitment and command power. In the fifth year of Chuping (194), it moved to Chengdu. At that time, the Yizhou Provincial Governor's Department was the place where the Hu people in the Western Regions were operating.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web |title=Chengdu, an Ancient and Modern City |url=http://www.chengdu.gov.cn/english/aboutCheng/2022-08/22/content_cfc5348d073e40fca7a79317e0331438.shtml |website=chengdu,China}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=何一民. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1237410933 |title=<>. |date=2018 |publisher=四川人民出版社 |others=CNPeReading, 王毅. |isbn=978-7-220-10717-7 |oclc=1237410933}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/781772631 |title=Chengdu tong shi |date=2011 |publisher=Sichuan ren min chu ban she |author="Chengdu tong shi" bian zuan wei yuan hui, 《成都通史》编纂委员会. |isbn=978-7-220-08208-5 |edition=Di 1 ban |location=Chengdu |oclc=781772631}}</ref>

In 1911, Chengdu's branch of the [[Railway Protection Movement]] helped trigger the [[Wuchang Uprising]], which led to the [[Xinhai Revolution]] that overthrew the Qing dynasty.<ref>[[#History|Cambridge History Vol 11, Part 2]]:522</ref><ref>[[#History|Cambridge History Vol 11, Part 2]]:524</ref>

During [[World War II]], the capital city of China was forced to move inland from [[Battle of Nanking|Nanjing]] to [[Battle of Wuhan|Wuhan]] in 1937 and from Wuhan to Chengdu, then from Chengdu to [[Chongqing]] in 1938, as the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) government under ''Generalissimo'' [[Chiang Kai-shek]] ultimately retreated to [[Sichuan]] to escape from the invading Japanese forces. They brought with them into Sichuan business people, workers, and academics who founded many of the industries and cultural institutions which continue to make Chengdu an important cultural and commercial production center.<ref name=":5" />

Chengdu became a military center for the KMT to regroup in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|War of Resistance]]. Chengdu was beyond the reach of the Imperial Japanese ground forces and escort fighter planes. However, the Japanese frequently flew in the then-highly advanced twin-engine long-ranged [[Mitsubishi G3M|G3M "Nell"]] [[medium bomber]]s to conduct massive [[Aerial bombardment of cities|aerial bombardments]] of both civilian and military targets in [[Bombing of Chongqing|Chongqing and Chengdu]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2014-06/03/content_17558023.htm |title=Chinese continue to seek justice for Japanese bombings – China |website=Chinadaily.com.cn|access-date=31 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620070438/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2014-06/03/content_17558023.htm |archive-date=20 June 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> The massed formation of the G3M bombers provided heavy firepower against [[Development of Chinese Nationalist air force (1937–45)|Chinese fighter planes]] assigned to the defense of Chongqing and Chengdu, which continued to cause problems for the Japanese attacks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://surfcity.kund.dalnet.se/sino-japanese-1939.htm |title=Håkans Aviation page – Sino-Japanese Air War 1939 |website=Surfcity.kund.dalnet.se|access-date=31 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232019/http://surfcity.kund.dalnet.se/sino-japanese-1939.htm |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://ww2today.com/5th-june-1941-thousands-die-in-chungking-raid |title=5th June 1941: Thousands die in Chungking raid |website=Ww2today.com |date=5 June 1941 |access-date=31 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808052317/http://ww2today.com/5th-june-1941-thousands-die-in-chungking-raid |archive-date=8 August 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Chengdu is located at the western edge of the [[Sichuan Basin]] and sits on the [[Chengdu Plain]]; the dominating terrain is plains. The [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#Prefecture level|prefecture]] ranges in latitude from 30° 05' to 31° 26' N, while its longitude ranges from 102° 54' to 104° 53' E, stretching for {{convert|192|km|sp=us}} from east to west and {{convert|166|km|abbr=on|sp=us}} south to north, administering {{convert|12390|km2|abbr=on}} of land. Neighboring prefectures are [[Deyang]] (NE), [[Ziyang, Sichuan|Ziyang]] (SE), [[Meishan]] (S), [[Ya'an]] (SW), and the [[Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture]] (N). The urban area, with an elevation of {{convert|500|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|sp=us}}, features a few rivers, three of them being the [[Jin River (Sichuan)|Jin]], [[Fu River (Sichuan)|Fu]], and [[Sha River]]s. Outside of the immediate urban area, the topography becomes more complex: to the east lies the [[Longquan Mountains]] ({{lang|zh-hans|龙泉山脉}}) and the Penzhong Hills ({{lang|zh|盆中丘陵}}); to the west lie the [[Qionglai Mountains]], which rise to {{convert|5364|m|abbr=on|sp=us}} in Dayi County. The highest point in Chengdu is Daxuetang (also known as Miaojiling) in Xiling Snow Mountain in Dayi County, with an altitude of 5,364 meters.

===Climate===
Chengdu has a [[monsoon]]-influenced [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cwa'') and is largely warm with high [[relative humidity]] all year. It has four distinct seasons, with moderate rainfall concentrated mainly in the warmer months, and relieved from both sweltering summers and freezing winters. The [[Qin Mountains]] (Qinling) to the far north help shield the city from cold [[Siberian anticyclone|Siberian winds]] in the winter; because of this, the short winter is milder than in the Lower [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]]. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in January is {{convert|5.9|°C|1}}, and snow is rare but there are a few periods of frost each winter. The summer is hot and humid, but not to the extent of the "[[Three Furnaces]]" cities of [[Chongqing]], [[Wuhan]], and [[Nanjing]], all of which lie in the Yangtze basin.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.gzkp.org.cn/show.aspx?id=180&cid=5 |script-title = zh:为什么重庆、武汉、南京有"三大火炉"之称？ |publisher = Guangzhou Popular Science News Net ({{lang|zh-hans|广州科普资讯网}}) |language = zh-cn |date = 12 September 2007 |access-date = 29 November 2010 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141112042247/http://www.gzkp.org.cn/show.aspx?id=180&cid=5 |archive-date = 12 November 2014

===Literature===
Some of China's most important literature comes from Chengdu. The city has been home to literary giants, such as [[Sima Xiangru]] and [[Yang Xiong (author)|Yang Xiong]], two masters of [[Fu (poetry)|Fu]], a mixture of descriptive prose and verse during the Tang dynasty; [[Li Bai]] and [[Du Fu]], the most eminent poets of the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song]] dynasties respectively; [[Yang Shen'an]], a famous scholar of the Ming dynasty; and [[Guo Moruo]] and [[Ba Jin]], two well-known modern writers. [[Chang Qu]], a historian of Chengdu during the Jin dynasty, compiled the earliest local historical records, the [[Record of Hua Yang State]]. [[Zhao Chongzuo]], a poet in Chengdu during the Later Shu Kingdom, edited [[Among the Flowers]], the first anthology of [[Ci (poetry)|Ci]] in China's history. [[Meng Chang]], the king of Later Shu, wrote the first couplet for the Spring Festival, which says, "A harvest year accepts celebrations, good festivals foreshadow long springs."{{cn|date=October 2024}}

The Apostolic Vicariate of Szechwan (now known as [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Chengdu]]) was established on 15 October 1696. [[Artus de Lionne]], a French missionary of [[Paris Foreign Missions Society]], was appointed as the first Apostolic Vicar.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

In 1890, the [[Canadian Methodist Mission]] was searching for more stations in Asia. In February 1891, Dr. {{ill|Virgil Chittenden Hart|zh|赫斐秋}}, who had been Superintendent of the New York Methodist Mission Society of Central China recommended that Chengtu be its first Mission sight. During the meeting, it was proposed he lead this contingency; having built western hospitals, Boy's and Girl's schools at Missions he established on the Yangtze and Gan Rivers from 1866 – 1888. On 9 May 1891 Dr. Virgil Hart arrived in Chengtu and two weeks later bought a home and had it subdivided into living quarters and a dispensary, for the later arriving Missionary staff to move into.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Virgil C. Hart; missionary statesman, founder of the American and Canadian missions in central and west China |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/17013400/ |access-date=2024-09-07 |website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA |archive-date=7 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240907210505/https://www.loc.gov/item/17013400/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 24 June 1892, the doors of Chengtu's first Protestant Mission Headquarters were opened with over one thousand people of the community attending. The first Methodist religious service was held the following Sunday with only several attendants. The first western dispensary in Sichuan was opened 3 November 1892 with sixteen patients seeking care. The mission site became so popular that a larger space was secured near Chengtu's East Gate in the spring of 1893. This site is where the city's first Methodist church ([[Sï-Shen-Tsï Methodist Church]]) and hospital were built. These were later razed by rioting Chinese in 1895 and the Mission staff retreated to Chongqing and later Shanghai to escape the marauders. Dr. Virgil Hart traveled to Peking to demand redress and full payment of retribution was collected from Sichuan Viceroy Liu Ping Chang. The mission compound was quickly rebuilt only to be destroyed once more in the riots of 1901. These were rebuilt a third time and later missionaries would relocate and expand the Boys' and Girls' Schools just south of the city, dedicating the Divinity College as Hart College in 1914; a part of the [[West China Union University]], that is now Sichuan University and the [[West China Medical Center|West China School of Medicine]] (Huaxiyida).<ref>"Man on a Mission" by Stanley Crawford</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Sichuan University Archives Guide to Collections of West China Union University [and medical school] |url=https://library.indianapolis.iu.edu/wmicproject/sites/default/files/Guide%20to%20Huaxi%20Archives%20at%20Sichuan%20University.pdf |access-date=2024-09-07 |website=[[Indiana University Indianapolis]] |archive-date=7 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240907210503/https://library.indianapolis.iu.edu/wmicproject/sites/default/files/Guide%20to%20Huaxi%20Archives%20at%20Sichuan%20University.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=华西协合大学档案（1910—1951）-四川大学档案馆 |url=https://archives.scu.edu.cn/info/1001/2230.htm |access-date=2024-09-07 |website=The University Archives of [[Sichuan University]] |archive-date=7 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240907210511/https://archives.scu.edu.cn/info/1001/2230.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> During the Cultural Revolution, the Sï-Shen-Tsï Methodist Church building was no longer in use and the building was entrusted to the nearby Chengdu City Second People's Hospital for management.

In December 2018 the authorities attempted to close a 500-member underground church, the [[Early Rain Covenant Church]], led by [[Wang Yi (pastor)|Pastor Wang Yi]]. Over 100 members of the church were arrested including the pastor and his wife. The church's kindergarten and theological college were raided and the church's media outlets were closed down. Before his arrest, church member Li Yingqiang declared: "Even if we are down to our last five, worship and gatherings will still go on because our faith is real. […] Persecution is a price worth paying for the Lord." Police are said to have told one member that the church had been declared an illegal organisation. Chinese media were banned from reporting the events. Video footage which found its way onto western social media showed arrests and photographs alleged to be of injuries inflicted by the police.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2177897/chinese-pastor-wang-yis-wife-accused-inciting-subversion-and |title=Chinese pastor's wife accused of subversion, held in unknown location |access-date=14 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215213043/https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2177897/chinese-pastor-wang-yis-wife-accused-inciting-subversion-and |archive-date=15 December 2018 |url-status=live|date=13 December 2018 }}</ref><ref name="scmp.com">{{cite web |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2177520/underground-chinese-church-members-vow-defy-crackdown-and-keep |title=Members of unofficial Chinese church vow to keep meeting |access-date=14 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181213082423/https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/2177520/underground-chinese-church-members-vow-defy-crackdown-and-keep |archive-date=13 December 2018 |url-status=live|date=11 December 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2018/12/minitrue-no-reports-on-chengdu-house-church-crackdown/ |title=Minitrue: No Reports on Chengdu Church Crackdown – China Digital Times (CDT) |date=11 December 2018 |access-date=14 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214164908/https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2018/12/minitrue-no-reports-on-chengdu-house-church-crackdown/ |archive-date=14 December 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> From a photo of {{M|s|link=y}}.

===Theater===
[[File:Sichuan opera Chengdu.jpg|thumb|Sichuan Opera]]
The saying "Shu opera towers above all other performances in the world" reflects the achievement of [[Sichuan opera]] and [[Zaju]] (an ancient form of comedic drama involving dancing, singing, poetry, and miming). In the city, the first named opera "Bullfighting" was written in the Warring States period. The first detailed recorded opera was staged in the royal court of Shu Kingdom during the Three Kingdom period. China's first clearly recorded Zaju was also performed in Chengdu. Tombs of witty Han dynasty poets were excavated in Chengdu. And [[Bian lian|face-changing]] masks and fire breathing remain hallmarks of the Sichuan opera.<ref>{{Cite web |title=评《清代杂剧叙录》 |url=http://www.sss.net.cn/115001/84658.aspx |website=Sichuan Social Science Online |access-date=7 September 2024 |archive-date=27 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240527135226/http://sss.net.cn/115001/84658.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Intangible Cultural Heritage – Sichuan Opera |url=http://scdfz.sc.gov.cn/scyx/scfy/content_149069 |access-date=2024-09-07 |website=Sichuan Provincial Local Chronicles Office |archive-date=7 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240907211014/http://scdfz.sc.gov.cn/scyx/scfy/content_149069 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=川剧介绍 - 乐器学习网 |url=https://www.yueqixuexi.com/baike/20190430212718.html |access-date=2024-09-07 |website=www.yueqixuexi.com |archive-date=7 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240907211012/https://www.yueqixuexi.com/baike/20190430212718.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=川剧，川剧门票，川剧变脸－四川川剧 |url=http://www.sccts.com/chengdu/chuanju.html |access-date=2024-09-07 |website=www.sccts.com |archive-date=3 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231203034947/http://www.sccts.com/chengdu/chuanju.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===River transport===
{{unreferencedsect|date=September 2024}}
Historically, the Jin River was used for boat traffic in and out of Chengdu. However, due to the size of the river itself and the reduced water depth over time, the Brocade River is no longer capable of carrying any type of water traffic. Therefore, Chengdu has no direct access to the [[Yangtze]] River or any other larger river. However, to ensure that Chengdu's goods have access to the river efficiently, [[inland port]] cities of [[Yibin]] and [[Luzhou]]—both of which are reachable from Chengdu within hours by expressways—on the [[Yangtze]] have commenced large-scale port infrastructure development. As materials and equipment for the rebuilding of northern Sichuan are sent in from the East Coast to Sichuan, these ports will see significant increases in throughput.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2004-04-07 |title=天府周末·钩沉{{!}} 河流趟过乡愁 旧光影里的成都"水"事 |trans-title=Tianfu Weekend - Hooked{{!}} Rivers Run Through Nostalgia: Chengdu's “Water” in Old Light and Shadow |url=http://scdfz.sc.gov.cn/scyx/scfw/content_49882 }}</ref>
