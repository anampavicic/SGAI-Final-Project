The fourth-largest  agglomerated urban area in Portugal after [[Lisbon Metropolitan Area|Lisbon]], [[Porto Metropolitan Area|Porto]], and [[Braga]], it is the largest city of the [[Coimbra (district)|district of Coimbra]] and the [[Centro Region, Portugal|Centro Region]]. About 460,000 people live in the [[Região de Coimbra]], comprising 19 municipalities and extending into an area of {{convert|4336|km2|0|abbr=out}}.

Among the many archaeological structures dating back to the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]], when Coimbra was the settlement of [[Aeminium]], are its well-preserved [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]] and [[cryptoporticus]]. Similarly, buildings from the period when Coimbra was the capital of Portugal (from 1131 to 1255) still remain. During the late [[Middle Ages]], with its decline as the political centre of the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], Coimbra began to evolve into a major cultural centre. This was in large part helped by the establishment of the [[University of Coimbra|first Portuguese university]] in 1290 in Lisbon and its relocation to Coimbra in 1308, making it the oldest academic institution in the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese-speaking]] world. Apart from attracting many European and [[international student]]s, the university is visited by many tourists for its monuments and history. Its historical buildings were classified as a [[World Heritage]] site by [[UNESCO]] in 2013: "Coimbra offers an outstanding example of an integrated university city with a specific urban typology as well as its own ceremonial and cultural traditions that have been kept alive through the ages."<ref name="unesco">{{cite web | url = https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1387 | title = University of Coimbra – Alta and Sofia | access-date = 2016-12-13 | website = unesco.org | publisher = [[UNESCO]] | archive-date = 12 July 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221819/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1387 | url-status = live }}</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Coimbra}}

===Roman Republic===
{{See also|Aeminium|Ancient Rome|Lusitania}}
[[File:Karinecyril coimbra aqueduc.jpg|thumb|Arcos do Jardim, built between 1568 and 1570 on the remains of a [[Roman aqueduct]]]]

The city, located on a hill by the [[Mondego River]], was called ''[[Aeminium]]'' in [[Roman times]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] founded the [[civitas]] of Aeminium in this place at the time of [[Augustus]] (63 BC – AD 14), which came under the protection of nearby [[Conímbriga]] (in [[Condeixa-a-Nova Municipality|Condeixa-a-Nova]]), some {{convert|15|km}} to the south. The Roman city was encircled by a wall, and followed an orthogonal plan, with the [[cardo maximus]] and [[decumanus maximus]] crossing at the [[Forum (Roman)|Forum]]. An [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]] existed, the remains of which were incorporated into a latter medieval renovation. Aeminium fell under the influence, administratively, of the larger city of ''Conímbriga'', until the latter was sacked by the [[Sueves]] and [[Visigoths]] between 465-8 and abandoned.<ref name="Evans">David J.J. Evans, Cadogan Guides Portugal (2004), {{ISBN|9781860111266}}, p.221</ref> It became the seat of a [[Roman province|diocesis]], replacing Conímbriga.

Although Conímbriga had been administratively important, Aeminium affirmed its position by being situated at the confluence of the north-south traffic that connected the Roman [[Bracara Augusta]] (Roman name of [[Braga]]) and [[Olisipo]] (Roman name of [[Lisbon]]) with its waterway, which enabled connections with the interior and coast. The limestone table on which the settlement grew has a dominant position overlooking the Mondego, circled by fertile lands irrigated by its waters. Vestiges of this early history include the [[cryptoporticus]] of the former Roman forum (now part of the [[Machado de Castro National Museum]]). The move of the settlement and bishopric of Conimbriga to Aeminium resulted in the name change to ''Conimbriga'', evolving later to ''Colimbria''.<ref name="Evans" />

===Suebi, Alans and Visigoths===
{{See also|Migration Period|Kingdom of the Suebi|County of Coimbra}}
[[File:Museu Nacional de Machado de Castro, 2002.jpg|thumb|right|[[Machado de Castro National Museum]]]]
After being subjected to the Roman Empire for a long time, a deluge of [[barbarians]] flooded the Iberian Peninsula in 409, and the [[Baixo Mondego|Lower Mondego]] area recognised [[Hermeric]], the landlord of the [[Kingdom of the Suebi|Suebi]], as its ruler. But the ambition to gain territory dominated [[Ataces]], king of the [[Alans]] and Coimbra fell from the hands of Hermeric. Ataces, the new lord of Coimbra, depopulated and devastated it fearing the security of its fortresses. Delighted, however, with the beauty of Lower Mondego, and with the easiness of its fields, he laid beside it the foundations for a new city which was called ''Colimbria''. Ataces converted to christianity, but being [[Arianism|arian]] by sect persecuted catholics with ferocity. The prisoners were either beheaded before the walls of the new city, their bodies serving as foundations, or employed like cargo donkeys in its edification. Nobody escaped the tyranny of Ataces: he ordered everyone to work on the construction of the walls. [[Elipando]], the holy Bishop of Coimbra was also there holding the stone and the clay for the works of the city. “Passing by the new Coimbra (says Arisberto, Bishop of Porto, writing to [[Samerico]], [[Archbishop of Braga]]), there I saw working in the construction of their walls many Ministers of God; among them, at the orders of Ataces, was also Bishop Elipando: I cried with them for their misfortune and for the loss of this fertile province of the Roman Empire.” Hermeric of the northern Kingdom of the Suebi, whose the capital was [[Bracara Augusta]] (former name of Braga), did not lose hope of rescuing the lands that had been taken by Ataces in the south. He crossed the [[Douro river]] and appeared with his army before the new walls of Coimbra. But Ataces triumphed and followed Hermeric's retreating army to the banks of Douro, further north, where the Suebi landlord would buy from him, in exchange for his daughter, peace and an alliance. Ataces, crowned with the laurels of victory continues with great fervor the reedification of the city he had plundered before. Hermeric visited him in Colimbria bringing him her daughter, princess [[Cindazunda]], who had been flourishing in age and beauty.[[Image:CBR.png|thumb|right|250px|The coat of arms of Coimbra is said to be inspired on [[Cindazunda]], [[Hermeric]]'s daughter. The legendary symbolism of the lion is tied to [[Ataces]], ruler of the Alans, and that of the serpent is tied to Hermeric, ruler of the Suebi.<ref>Heráldica, Coimbra City Hall https://www.cm-coimbra.pt/areas/viver/a-cidade/heraldica {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210413053639/https://www.cm-coimbra.pt/areas/viver/a-cidade/heraldica |date=13 April 2021 }}</ref>]] Ataces, in order to show his gratitude had the picture of his new wife placed in a vase, with a serpent on one side and a lion walking towards her on the other. Those were the insignias of Ataces (lion) and Hermeric (serpent). Cindazunda had her eyes lifted up the sky and her hands raised as if thanking the Eternal for having been the medium between the father and the husband and having united with bonds of peace and friendship the serpent and the lion, up until that moment, enemies. As the walls and towers of the city were being built, the workers carved on the stones this insignia so pleasant to the King, that until today, has been the coat of arms of Coimbra. Cindazunda, professing Catholicism, established the bonds of peace between the two kings and improved the fortunes of the inhabitants of Coimbra mitigating the ferocious spirit of Ataces against the catholics. The [[Visigoths]] would conquest the region later. During the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic era (from the 5th to the early 8th century)]], the [[County of Coimbra]] was created by king [[Wittiza]] (c. 687 – probably 710) and it was a sub-county of his dominion, established as a fief for his son prince Ardabast (or [[Sisebuto]]), with its seat in ''Emínio'' (the Visigothic name for Coimbra), which persisted until the Muslim invasion from the south.<ref>Bellezas de Coimbra by António Moniz Barreto Corte-Real.

===Islamic Era===
The first Muslim campaigns that occupied the Iberian Peninsula occurred between 711 and 715, with Coimbra capitulating to [[Musa bin Nusair]] in 714. Although it was not a large settlement, Qulumriyah ({{langx|ar|قُلُمْرِيَة}}), in the context of [[Al-Andalus]], was the largest agglomerated centre along the northern Tagus valley, and its principal city boasted a walled enclosure of 10 hectares, supporting between 3000 and 5000 inhabitants. Remnants of this period include the beginnings of the [[Almedina]], [[Arrabalde]] and the fortified palace used by the city's governor (which was later converted into the Royal Palace by the early Portuguese monarchs). The Christian [[Reconquista]] forced the [[Banu Dānis]] and the other Muslims to abandon the region temporarily. Successively the Moors retook the castle in 987–1064 and again in 1116, capturing two castles constructed to protect the territory: in [[Miranda do Corvo|Miranda da Beira]] (where the garrison was slaughtered) and in [[Figueira da Foz|Santa Eulália]] (where the governor surrendered his forces rather than facing a similar massacre).<ref name=Evans/>

===Middle Ages===
{{See also|Portugal in the Middle Ages|Portugal in the Reconquista|Siege of Coimbra (1117)}}
[[File:Coimbra Medieval House Sobrado.jpg|thumb|Medieval houses "sobrado" in Coimbra.]]

The reconquest of the territory was attained in 1064 by King [[Ferdinand I of León and Castile]], who appointed [[Dom (title)|Dom]] [[Sisnando Davides]] to reorganize the economy and administer the lands encircling the city. The [[County of Portucale]] and the [[County of Coimbra]] were later integrated into one dominion under the stewardship of [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Henry of Burgundy]] by [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile]] in 1096, when Henry married Alfonso's illegitimate daughter [[Theresa, Countess of Portugal|Theresa]]. Henry expanded the frontiers of the County, confronting the [[Moors|Moorish]] forces, and upon his death in 1112, Theresa, Countess of Portucale and Coimbra, unified her possessions. Their son, [[Afonso Henriques]], who took up residence in the ancient seat of the Christian County of Coimbra, sent expeditions to the south and west, consolidating a network of castles that included [[Leiria]], [[Soure, Portugal|Soure]], Rabaçal, [[Alvorge]] and [[Ansião]].<ref name=Evans/>

[[File:StCruz-CCBY.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Manueline]] façade of the [[Santa Cruz Monastery|Monastery of Santa Cruz]], final resting place of the first Portuguese monarch ([[Afonso Henriques]]).]]

During the 12th century, Afonso Henriques administered an area of fertile lands with river access and protected by a fortified city, whose population exceeded 6000 inhabitants, including [[magnate]]s, knights and high clergy. The young [[Infante]] encouraged the construction of his seat, funding the [[Santa Cruz Monastery]] (the most important Portuguese [[monastic]] institution at the time, founded in 1131 by [[Theotonius]]), promoted the construction of the [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra|Old Cathedral]], reconstructed the original Roman bridge in 1132, and repaired and renovated fountains, kilns, roads and stone pavements, as well as the walls of the old city. In order to confirm and reinforce the power of the ''[[concelho]]'' (municipality) he conceded a formal [[foral]] (charter) in 1179.

Already in the [[Middle Ages]], Coimbra was divided into an upper city (''Cidade Alta'' or ''[[Almedina (Coimbra)|Almedina]]''), where the [[aristocracy]] and the clergy lived, and the merchant, artisan and labour centres in the lower city (''Arrabalde'' or ''Cidade Baixa'') by the [[Mondego River]], in addition to the old and new Jewish quarters. The city was encircled by a [[fortified wall]], of which some remnants are still visible like the Almedina Gate (''Porta da Almedina'').

[[File:Pt-coias-mosteiro-staclara.jpg|thumb|[[Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Velha]], refounded in 1314 by Queen [[Elizabeth of Portugal]] as a convent of [[Poor Clares]] in the parish of [[Santa Clara (Coimbra)|Santa Clara]]]]

Meanwhile, on the periphery, the municipality began to grow in various agglomerations, notably around the monasteries and convents that developed in Celas, [[Santa Clara (Coimbra)|Santa Clara]], [[Santo António dos Olivais]]. The most important work in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style in the city is the [[Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Velha]], founded on the left side of the river Mondego by Queen [[Elizabeth of Portugal]] in the first half of the 14th century. It stood too close to the river, and frequent floods forced the nuns to abandon it in the 17th century, when the [[Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Nova]] was built uphill. The Queen's magnificent Gothic tomb was also transferred to the new convent.  The ruins of the old convent were excavated in the 2000s, and can be seen today on the left bank of the river.

===Renaissance===
[[File:Coimbra (Braun – Hogenberg, 1598).jpg|thumb|Coimbra by Frans Hogenberg ca. 1598]]
In the 15th and 16th centuries, during the [[Age of Discovery]], Coimbra was again one of the main artistic centres of Portugal thanks to both local and royal [[patronage]]. Coimbra [[bishops]], [[religious orders]] and [[Manuel I of Portugal|King Manuel I]] supported artists like Diogo Pires (father and son), Marcos Pires, [[João de Castilho]], Diogo de Castilho and the Frenchmen, João de Ruão and Nicholas of Chanterene, among others, who left important [[Manueline]] and [[Renaissance]] works in the town. Dating from this period are the remodelling (in Manueline style) of the [[Santa Cruz Monastery]], including the tombs of Kings [[Afonso Henriques]] and [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]], the Renaissance Manga Fountain, and the altarpieces and triumphal portal of the [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra|Old Cathedral]], among other works.

[[File:Library of the Universtity of Coimbra.jpg|thumb|The interior stacks of the [[Biblioteca Joanina|Joanine Library]], one of the oldest collections in Portugal]]

The [[University of Coimbra]], was founded as a [[Studium Generale]] in Lisbon in 1290 by [[Dinis I of Portugal|King Dinis I]]. The University was relocated to Coimbra in 1308, but in 1338 King [[Afonso IV of Portugal|D. Afonso IV]] returned the University to Lisbon.  The University was definitively transferred to the premises of Coimbra Royal Palace in 1537 by [[John III of Portugal|King John III]], and expanded by 1544 to occupy the Coimbra Royal Palace.  Since then, city life has revolved around the state-run university. For many decades, several colleges (''colégios'') established by the religious orders provided an alternative to the official institution, but were gradually discontinued with the secularization of education in Portugal. Built in the 18th century, the [[Joanina Library]] (''Biblioteca Joanina''), a [[Baroque]] library, is another notable landmark of the ancient university.  The [[Baroque]] University Tower (''Torre da Universidade'') designed by [[Antonio Canevari|António Canevari]] and built between 1728 and 1733, is an iconic monument of the city.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |title=A Torre da UC em Lego |url=https://noticias.uc.pt/artigos/a-torre-da-uc-em-lego/ |access-date=2023-12-24 |website=uc.pt |language=pt}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Best Of {{!}} Portugal e Espanha |url=https://en.grupo-gala-best-of.com/torre-da-universidade |access-date=2023-12-24 |website=Best of Grupo Gala |language=en}}</ref>

In 1772, the [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal|Marquis of Pombal]], prime minister of King [[José I]], undertook a major reform of the university, where the study of the sciences assumed vast importance. The collections of scientific instruments and material acquired then are now gathered in the [[Science Museum of the University of Coimbra]], and constitute one of the most important historical science collections in Europe. However, his desire to modernize the university resulted in the complete demolition of Coimbra's medieval city walls and castle, very little of which remains today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.castelosemuralhasdomondego.pt/website/en/almedina|title=Coimbra Castle History|website=www.castelosemuralhasdomondego.pt|access-date=April 4, 2020|archive-date=28 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728165646/http://www.castelosemuralhasdomondego.pt/website/en/almedina|url-status=live}}</ref> In the same year, [[Luísa de Jesus]], a local 23-year-old woman, was [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] for multiple [[infanticide]] becoming the last woman to be executed in the country's history.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |last=Pamela Malva |date=May 17, 2020 |title=LADRA DE ALMAS INOCENTES: A SOMBRIA TRAJETÓRIA DE LUÍSA DE JESUS |trans-title=THIEF OF INNOCENT SOULS: THE DARK TRAJECTORY OF LUÍSA DE JESUS |url=https://aventurasnahistoria.uol.com.br/noticias/reportagem/ladra-de-almas-inocentes-sombria-trajetoria-de-luisa-de-jesus.phtml |archive-url=https://archive.today/20220107110739/https://aventurasnahistoria.uol.com.br/noticias/reportagem/ladra-de-almas-inocentes-sombria-trajetoria-de-luisa-de-jesus.phtml |archive-date=January 7, 2022 |work=Aventuras na História |language=pt}}</ref> She is also considered the deadliest [[serial killer]] in Portuguese crime history.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |title=Luísa de Jesus confessou ter assassinado 28 crianças.

The first half of the 19th century was a difficult period for Coimbra, being invaded by [[French Invasion of Portugal|French troops]] under the command of [[Andoche Junot]] and [[André Masséna]] during the [[Peninsular War]]. A force of 4,000 Portuguese [[militia]] led by [[Nicholas Trant]] dealt [[Masséna]] a heavy blow when it recaptured the city on 6 October 1810. In March 1811, the militia successfully held the place against the retreating [[Napoleonic Wars|French army]]. The city recovered in the second half of the 19th century with infrastructure improvements like the [[telegraph]], gas light, the railway system, a railway bridge over the Mondego River and the renovation of the Portela bridge, in addition to the broadening of roads and expansion of the city into the Quinta de Santa Cruz.

By 1854, with the expulsion of the religious orders and municipal reforms, the need to reorganize the municipality of Coimbra forced some changes in the existing structure of the administrative divisions. Consequently, documents were sent (on 20 January 1854) to the Ministries of Ecclesiastical Affairs ({{langx|pt|Ministério dos Negócios Eclesiásticos}}) and Justice ({{langx|pt|Ministério de Justiça}}) urging the identification by the Civil Governor and Archbishop of Coimbra (Manuel Bento Rodrigues) of the number of civil parishes to preserve, their limits, the political organs to be retained, a local census and other statistics to justify the demarcation of the territory.<ref name="SAOlivais">{{citation |first=José Manuel Azevedo |last=Silva |editor=Câmara Municipal |publisher=Câmara Municipal de Santo António dos Olivais |location=Santo António dos Olivias (Coimbra), Portugal |year=2011 |language=pt |title=A criação da freguesia de Santo António dos Olivais: Visão Histórica e Perspectivas Actuais |url=http://www.jfsao.pt/documentos/Historia.da.Freguesia.pdf |access-date=5 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220023113/http://www.jfsao.pt/documentos/Historia.da.Freguesia.pdf |archive-date=20 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}, p. 2-3</ref> A commission of five members, which included João Maria Baptista Callixto, António dos Santos Pereira Jardim, Roque Joaquim Fernandes Thomás, João Correia Ayres de Campos and António Egypcio Quaresma Lopes de Carvalho e Vasconcelos, was appointed to produce a plan to reduce, suppress, demarcate and establish civil parishes in the city of Coimbra and its suburbs.<ref name=SAOlivais/>

===Republic===
On 1{{nbsp}}January 1911, electric tramways were inaugurated to connect the old quarter with its expanding periphery, which included the residential areas of Celas, Olivais, Penedo da Saudade and Calhabé, all located in the civil parish of [[Santo António dos Olivais]]. This was only the initiation of the municipality growth. Civil construction projects throughout the region marked the economic activity of the territory, with new areas such as Montes Claros, Arregaça, Cumeada and Calhabé growing in the shadow of the city. Even projects that had been planned at the end of the 19th century gained new initiative, including the expansion of the Santa Cruz neighbourhood (''bairro''), the demolition of the residential area of the Alta de Coimbra (1940–50) to expand the university, and construction or expansion of the bairros of Celas, Sete Fontes and Marechal Carmona (now the bairro of Norton de Matos).

One of the nation's most important crossroads, Coimbra was historically at a junction between Braga and Lisbon, and its river access (the [[Mondego River|Mondego]] flows through the municipality) provided a route between the interior communities and the coastal towns (including the seaside city of [[Figueira da Foz]], {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Coimbra). The historic city of Coimbra is located centrally within the municipality, connected to Lisbon ({{convert|197|km|0|abbr=on}}) and Porto ({{convert|116|km|0|abbr=on}}) by the IC2, IP3 and [[A1 - Auto-estrada do Norte|A1]] motorways.<ref name=santos>{{citation |url=https://especial.imgs.sapo.pt/multimedia/pdf/local/Coimbra.pdf |title=Caracterização Sócio- Económica dos Concelhos Concelho de Coimbra |publisher=Direcção Geral do Ordenamento do Território e Desenvolvimento Urbano/Direcção de Serviços de Estudos e Planeamento Estratégico/Divisão de Estudos e Planeamento |date=December 2004 |first=Luísa |last=Santos |language=pt |location=Coimbra, Portugal |access-date=29 July 2018 |archive-date=10 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210110224848/https://especial.imgs.sapo.pt/multimedia/pdf/local/Coimbra.pdf |url-status=dead }} p. 5-13</ref>

Just outside the municipality, there are also several picturesque mountain towns such as [[Lousã]] and [[Penacova]], while spa towns and villages, such as [[Luso, Portugal|Luso]], [[Buçaco]] and [[Curia]] are commonplace.

Although it ceased serving as the capital of [[Portugal]] in the 13th century, Coimbra retains considerable importance as the centre of the former [[Beira, Portugal|Beira]] province, now designated the [[Centro, Portugal|Centro]] region. It is considered alongside [[Braga]] one of the two most important regional centres in Portugal outside the [[Lisbon metropolitan area|Lisbon]] and [[Porto Metropolitan Area|Porto]]s [[metropole]]s, the centre for the whole middle region of the country. With a dense urban grid, the municipality is known primarily for the city of Coimbra, itself famous for its monuments, churches, libraries, museums, parks, nightlife, healthcare and shopping facilities. Above all, its cultural life, oriented around the [[University of Coimbra]], has historically attracted the nation's [[Coimbra Municipality#Notable citizens|notable]] writers, [[artists]], [[academic]]s and [[aristocracy]], securing its reputation as the ''Lusa-Atenas'' (Lusitanian [[Athens]]).

===Ecoregions/protected areas===

The western edge of Coimbra is covered by the ''[[Reserva Natural do Paul de Arzila]]'' (''Arzila Swamp Natural Reserve''), which is designated both as a ''Special Protection Zone'' ({{langx|pt|Zona de Protecção Especial}}) and ''Special Conservation Zone'' ({{langx|pt|Zona Especial de Conservação}}), coincident with the civil parish of Arzila (sometimes referred to as the ''Paul de Arzila'' or ''marsh of Arzila'').<ref name="Paul">{{citation |url=http://portal.icnb.pt/NR/rdonlyres/08E60D78-DB75-4675-8062-8D7681AFB585/0/ZPE_Paul_Arzila.pdf |title=Plano Sectoral da Rede Natura 2000 (Zonas de Protecção Especial): Paul de Arzila |publisher=ICNB Instituto de Conservação da Natureza e da Biodiversidade |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=pt |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327103051/http://portal.icnb.pt/NR/rdonlyres/08E60D78-DB75-4675-8062-8D7681AFB585/0/ZPE_Paul_Arzila.pdf |archive-date=27 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It is a [[wetland]] that has sheltered migratory birds, and supports other animal and plant species; this has included predominantly avian species, such as the: [[Eurasian reed warbler]] (''Acrocephalus scirpaceus''), [[sedge warbler]] (''Acrocephalus schoenobaenus''), [[melodious warbler]] (''Hippolais polyglotta''), [[willow warbler]] (''Phylloscopus trochilus''), [[little bittern]] (''Ixobrychus minutus''), [[great reed warbler]] (''Acrocephalus arundinaceus''), and the [[Savi's warbler]] (''Locustella luscinioides'').<ref name=Paul/> The 482 hectare area, under threat from industrial, residential and [[agricultural pollution]], expansion of aquatic plants and [[eutrophication]], has forced the governmental reorganization of land use in order to promote models of sustainability, and rural use that does not affect the migratory and aquatic bird populations.<ref name=Paul/>

The municipal government has also promoted the installation and maintenance of various [[parks]], [[playgrounds]], [[gardens]] and forests, including the development of the [[Botanical Garden of the University of Coimbra]] (considered the fifth oldest in the world), the ''[[Mata Nacional do Choupal]]'', the ''Mata Nacional de Vale de Canas'', ''Jardim da Sereia'' (also known as ''Santa Cruz Garden''), ''[[Penedo da Saudade]]'', ''Parque Manuel Braga'', ''Parque Verde do Mondego'', ''Choupalinho'', and the 19th century [[Quinta das Lágrimas]] estate and gardens.

Complementing these natural spaces are the riverside parks and bathing areas that line the Mondego, including the river beaches of Palheiros do Zorro, in the parish of Torres do Mondego.

The city is on [[the Portuguese Way]] of the Road of St James (Caminho de Santiago).

===Climate===
Coimbra has a [[Mediterranean climate|warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csb'') in a transition to a hot-summer (''Csa'') version of the interior of [[Centro Region, Portugal|Central Portugal]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=94580&cityname=Coimbra,+Coimbra,+Portugal&units=|title=Coimbra, Portugal Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2019-04-19|archive-date=28 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728171843/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=94580&cityname=Coimbra,+Coimbra,+Portugal&units=|url-status=live}}</ref> 

In winter, temperatures range between {{convert|15|-|16|°C|0}} at day and {{convert|5|-|7|°C|0}} at night, occasionally dropping below {{convert|0|°C|0}}, with an average of 19 days with frost per year;<ref name="IPMA" /> while summer temperatures range between {{convert|28|-|29|°C|0}} at day and {{convert|15|-|16|°C|0}} at night and can reach {{convert|40|°C|0}} or more in hotter days. Coimbra has around 32 days a year with maximum temperatures above {{convert|30|°C|0}}. The lowest and highest temperatures ever recorded in Coimbra were {{convert|-4.9|°C|1}} on 27 January 1976 and {{convert|42.3|°C|1}}.<ref name="IPMA">{{cite web |title=Coimbra (Bencanta), 1971-2000 normals and extremes |url=https://www.ipma.pt/bin/file.data/climate-normal/cn_71-00_COIMBRA_BENCANTA.pdf |publisher=[[IPMA]] |access-date=2 March 2021 |archive-date=22 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200922144349/http://www.ipma.pt/bin/file.data/climate-normal/cn_71-00_COIMBRA_BENCANTA.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

Precipitation is abundant throughout the year, except for July and August.

Despite being relatively distant from the coast, Coimbra also has a marked Atlantic influence due to the [[floodplain]] of the [[Mondego River]] which crosses the city, making both its winters and summers milder than they would otherwise be. This influence also makes cold waves less frequent and less intense, however, days with  negative minimum temperatures and cold waves are still present occasionally. Topography is also an important factor to consider in regard to nighttime temperatures, the presence of [[Inversion (meteorology)|cold air lakes]], in topographically depressed areas at certain synoptic situations, can also lead to pronounced colder temperatures.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mateus |first1=Carla Patrícia Pedroso |title=Ondas de calor e ondas de frio em Coimbra: Impactes na mortalidade da população |date=21 October 2014 |url=https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/handle/10316/27650 |publisher=[[University of Coimbra]] |access-date=2 March 2021 |archive-date=8 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220408050216/https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/handle/10316/27650 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The wealth of the city rests mostly on the [[University of Coimbra]] with about 28,000<ref>{{Cite web |last=Coimbra |first=Universidade de |title=Ensino |url=https://www.uc.pt/dados/ensino/ |access-date=2024-01-23 |website=uc.pt |language=pt}}</ref> students – the city has a total of over 38,000<ref>{{Cite web |title=Número de estudantes colocados aumenta 14% – Instituto Politécnico de Coimbra |url=https://www.ipc.pt/artigos/numero-de-estudantes-colocados-aumenta-14/ |access-date=2024-01-23 |language=pt-pt}}</ref> higher education students considering the other higher education institutions based there – but also in shopping, technology and [[health sciences]] industry, administrative offices, financial services, law firms and specialised medical care. The city has many private clinics, medical offices and two large state-run hospital centres: the ''[[Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra|H.U.C. – Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra]]'', which is a [[university hospital]], and the ''[[Centro Hospitalar de Coimbra|C.H.C. – Centro Hospitalar de Coimbra]]'', which includes a [[Hospital#Types|general hospital]]. Coimbra has also the regional branch of the national cancer hospital – the ''[[Instituto Português de Oncologia|I.P.O. – Instituto Português de Oncologia]]'', as well as a [[military hospital]]. The [[Instituto Nacional de Medicina Legal]], the state-run forensic science institute of Portugal, is headquartered in Coimbra.

Notable companies based in the municipality of Coimbra include [[software companies]] [[Critical Software]] and Ciberbit which have their global headquarters in the city, mechanical and electronics engineering company [[Active Space Technologies]], [[data science]] company [[Feedzai]], [[telemetry]] and [[Machine to Machine]] company ISA, [[Cimpor]]'s cement factory in Souselas (CIMPOR Souselas), the pan-European service facility of [[Olympus Corporation]], the [[pharmaceuticals]] companies [[Bluepharma]] and [[Laboratórios BASI|BASI]], the iron [[foundry]] [[Fucoli-Somepal]] and several [[ceramic]]s, [[food processing]] ([[Probar]] produces cold meat products and Dan Cake produces [[sponge cake]]s and [[swiss roll]]s), [[textiles]], wine, civil and engineering construction, architecture, public works and housing construction firms. [[Handicraft]] industry is well represented by traditional [[tapestry]] and [[pottery]] manufacture, and the surroundings of the city have besides [[forestry]], dynamic horticulture production, [[vineyards]] and livestock raising. The ''[[Instituto Pedro Nunes]]'' (Pedro Nunes Institute), a [[business incubator]], dynamically hosts several [[startup company|start-ups]] which are usually dedicated to technology-related businesses and become independent [[Research spin-off|spin-off]] companies headquartered across the whole region. There is a move by municipal authorities to bring in more innovation and high-technology businesses, through initiatives such as the [[Coimbra Innovation Park]], with the objective of promoting innovation and companies that promote research and development (such as [[nanotechnology]] company Innovnano, a subsidiary of [[Companhia União Fabril]]).<ref>{{citation |language=pt |url=http://www.josedemello.pt/gjm_tdf_01.asp?lang=pt&artigo=652 |title=Innovnano inaugura nova fábrica em 2011 |publisher=[[Grupo José de Mello]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20110122085512/http%3A//www.josedemello.pt/gjm_tdf_01.asp?lang%3Dpt%26artigo%3D652 |archive-date=22 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Transportation==
The two banks of Mondego River at Coimbra, are linked by three main bridges: the ''Ponte do Açude'', the ''Ponte de Santa Clara'' (which is the oldest) and ''[[Rainha Santa Isabel Bridge|Ponte Rainha Santa]]'', also known as ''Ponte Europa''. The ''Ponte Pedonal de Pedro e Inês'' is the most recently constructed bridge and the only footbridge in the city.

The city is internally connected by an extensive bus network, the SMTUC (''Serviços Municipalizados de Transportes Urbanos de Coimbra'', Coimbra Municipality Urban Transport Services) and the [[Trolleybuses in Coimbra|Coimbra trolleybus system]] (the only such system in Portugal). In the past, the city also had a tram network (some are now parked inside a transportation museum). [[Taxicab]]s are also available, and are recognizable as cream or black and green (black car with green rooftop) taxis. The city is a hub for interregional bus services for all the country and abroad. A light-rail metro system, [[Metro Mondego]], was proposed however the project was abandoned at the height of Portuguese financial crisis.

[[File:CoimbraA-Station.jpg|thumb|left|''Coimbra-A'' railway station.]]

Coimbra has several rail stations. The principal station ''Coimbra-B'' is on the main line between [[Porto]] and [[Lisbon]]. In addition, the train-hotel Lusitania connects Coimbra and Madrid every night.<ref>{{citation |publisher=Travelinho.com |language=en |title=How can I get from Madrid to Coimbra by train? |url=https://www.travelinho.com/en/blog/madrid-coimbra#train |access-date=25 September 2018 |archive-date=25 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925215829/https://www.travelinho.com/en/blog/madrid-coimbra#train |url-status=live }}</ref>

From this station, a small spur runs to ''Coimbra-A'', the main station in the city centre. A small regional rail line (''Linha da Lousã'') also ran from ''Coimbra Parque'' at the south edge of the city centre. From Coimbra-Parque was possible to travel to [[Miranda do Corvo]], [[Lousã]] and Serpins, among others. The line was closed for upgrading as part of the [[Metro Mondego]] project and was never reopened when the Metro Mondego project was abandoned, but there is local pressure for the line to be reopened. It is also possible to travel by train between Coimbra and [[Figueira da Foz]] (''[[Ramal de Alfarelos]]''), and Coimbra, [[Guarda, Portugal|Guarda]] and [[Vilar Formoso]] (''[[Linha da Beira Alta]]'').

Coimbra is served by the [[A1 - Auto-estrada do Norte|A1]] motorway, which connects [[Lisbon]] to [[Porto]].

A regional aerodrome is in Cernache (''[[Aeródromo Municipal Bissaya Barreto]]'') (CBP) [PCO], {{convert|7.5|km|1|abbr=off}} southwest of the centre. With a {{convert|920|m|0|abbr=off}} runway and [[flight information service]] until sunset, this regional airport has all the fundamental facilities for private flights.

The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Coimbra, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 35 min. 2.4% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 12 min, and 16.8% of riders wait for over 20 min on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 2&nbsp;km, and 0% travel for over 12&nbsp;km in a single direction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coimbra Public Transportation Statistics|publisher=Global Public Transit Index by Moovit|url=https://www.moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_Portugal_Coimbra-1905|access-date=June 19, 2017|archive-date=24 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824222853/https://www.moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_Portugal_Coimbra-1905|url-status=live}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016050101/https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ |date=16 October 2017 }}.</ref>

==Education==
[[File:Coimbra University tower building.jpg|thumb|left|The main square and buildings of the historic block of the [[University of Coimbra]]]]

Coimbra has been called ''A cidade dos estudantes'' (The city of the students) or ''Lusa-Atenas'' (Lusitan-Athens), mainly because it is the site of the oldest and one of the largest universities in Portugal – the [[University of Coimbra]], a [[public university]] whose origins can be traced back to the 13th century. Nowadays, it has students from 70 different nationalities; almost 10% of its students are foreigners, making it Portugal's most international university.

[[File:Coimbra University robes burian 5588.jpg|thumb|250px|University students in robes during the first week of classes, Coimbra (2019)]]

Coimbra is also the place where the oldest and biggest university [[students' union]] of Portugal was founded – the ''[[Associação Académica de Coimbra]]'' (Academic Association of Coimbra), established in 1887.

As well, there are some other schools and institutes of higher education in the city: the ''[[Instituto Politécnico de Coimbra]]'', a public [[polytechnic (Portugal)|polytechnic]] institute; the ''[[Escola Superior de Enfermagem de Coimbra]]'', a public [[nursing school]]; and some private higher education institutions such as the ''Instituto Superior Miguel Torga''; the ''Instituto Superior Bissaya Barreto''; the ''Escola Universitária Vasco da Gama'' and finally, the ''Escola Universitária das Artes de Coimbra'', an [[art school]].

A large number of higher education students from all of Portugal chose Coimbra's higher learning institutions to study, due to the wide availability of degrees offered in different fields, the student-friendly environment of the city, and the prestige of many of its learning institutions allied to the ancient tradition of Coimbra as the historical capital of higher studies in Portugal.

The city has also a large number of public and private basic and secondary schools, among these some of the best-ranked in the country, like ''Escola Secundária Infanta D. Maria'' (public), ''Escola Secundária José Falcão'' (public), "Escola EB2/3 Martim de Freitas" (public), ''Colégio Rainha Santa Isabel'' (private) and ''Colégio de São Teotónio'' (private), as well as several kindergartens and nurseries. There is also the Coimbra Hotel and Tourism School.

=== TUMO Coimbra ===
TUMO Coimbra is the first to open in [[Portugal]]. The building is located in the old post office, next to the city market and the town hall. The first centre is part of a nationwide expansion of the armenian [[Tumo Center for Creative Technologies]] that aims to disrupt formal education in the country and bring young Portuguese closer to various creative and digital skills. More than 1,000 young people are expected to attend in the first year at TUMO Coimbra.

The project is made possible through the initiative of some based in or nearby Coimbra sponsors such as [[Critical Software]], Paulo Marques and Pedro Bizarro (founders of [[Feedzai]]), [[Licor Beirão]] and Coimbra City Council. Other sponsors are [[Oxy Capital]], [[Altice Portugal]], ''[[La Caixa]]'' Foundation, the [[Santander Group]] Foundation and the [[Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=TumoPT|url=https://coimbra.tumo.pt/|access-date=2023-09-20|website=TUMO Coimbra|language=pt-PT|archive-date=27 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230927155445/https://coimbra.tumo.pt/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Coimbra fado===
The ''[[Fado de Coimbra]]'' is a highly stylised genre of ''[[fado]]'' music originated in Coimbra. Among its most notable and historical adherents are guitarist [[Carlos Paredes]] and singer [[Zeca Afonso]], while the ''[[Orfeon Académico de Coimbra]]'' (the oldest and most famous academic [[choir]] in Portugal) and the ''[[Associação Académica de Coimbra]]'' are important organizations that promote the culture and stylings of this subgenre of music. In addition, Coimbra has a contemporary music, boasting several live music venues, and some of the most popular clubs and music festivals in Portugal. Moreover, the ''Conservatório de Música de Coimbra'', musical departments of the [[Associação Académica de Coimbra]] and the music programmes of the Faculty of Letters are noted by many of top music schools in the country.

The ''[[Orfeon Académico de Coimbra]]'' is an autonomous organization of the students' union ''Associação Académica de Coimbra'', established in 1880 by a law student of the University of Coimbra (UC), and the ''fado'' section of UC's ''Associação Académica de Coimbra'' itself, are important organizations in Coimbra fado promotion and preservation.

According to tradition, to applaud fado in Lisbon one would clap his hands, while in Coimbra cough as if clearing the throat is the typical way.

===Student festivals===
Coimbra is also known for its university students' festivals. Two are held every year. The first one, ''Latada'' or ''[[Festa das Latas]]'' ("The Tin Can Parade") is a [[homecoming]] parade that occurs at the beginning of the academic year, and is a welcome to the new university students (''Caloiros'').

[[File:Coimbra Queima das Fitas.jpg|250px|thumb|Undergraduate Medicine students participating in Coimbra's ''[[Queima das Fitas]]'' parade]]

The ''Festa das Latas'' goes back to the 19th century when the Coimbra students felt the need to express their joy at finishing the school year in as loud a way as possible, using everything at their disposal that would make noise, namely tin cans. The highlight of this festival, which now takes place at the beginning of the academic year (November) is the special parade known as the ''Latada''. After marching through the streets of the city the new students are "baptised" in the Mondego River thus entering into the Coimbra academic fraternity. The students from the penultimate year, normally the 3rd year's students, are awarded their ''Grelos'' (a small ribbon). The ''Grelo'' is a small, woollen ribbon with the colour (s) of the student's faculty that is attached to a student's briefcase. Previous to this, at the morning the students must have visited the Dom Pedro V market where they must get a [[turnip]] to sustain the ''Caloiros'' during the day's festivities. Besides the tin cans they have tied to their legs, the new students wear all kinds of costumes made up according to the creativity and imagination of their ''godmothers'' or ''godfathers'' who are older students. They also carry placards with ironic criticisms alluding to certain teachers, the educational system, national events and leaders.

The second one, ''[[Queima das Fitas]]'' ("The Burning of the Ribbons"), takes place at the end of the second semester (usually in the beginning of May) and it is one of the biggest student parties in all Europe. It lasts for eight days, one for each University of Coimbra's Faculty: ''Letras'' (Humanities), ''Direito'' (Law), ''Medicina'' (Medicine), ''Ciências e Tecnologia'' (Sciences and Technology), ''Farmácia'' (Pharmacy), ''Economia'' (Economics), ''Psicologia e Ciências da Educação'' (Psychology and Education Sciences) and ''Ciências do Desporto e Educação Física'' (Sports Sciences and Physical Education).

Although being University of Coimbra's festivals, other higher education students of Coimbra such as the polytechnic's students or private institution's students, are invited every year by the University of Coimbra students who manage and organise this events, to participate in the ''Tin Can Parade'' and also in the ''Burning of the Ribbons''. The academic festivities are opened to the entire city community and attract a large number of national and international tourists as well.

===Music acts===
Coimbra has a lively music scene that caters for most tastes with many festivals and events beyond the academic festivals, the traditional [[Coimbra fado]] genre and [[Artur Paredes]], [[Adriano Correia de Oliveira]] and [[Zeca Afonso]]'s musical heritage. It boasts several live music venues, and some of the most popular club nights and music festivals in Portugal. Moreover, the Conservatório de Música de Coimbra,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.conservatoriomcoimbra.pt/ |title=Conservatório de Música de Coimbra |access-date=1 September 2009 |archive-date=28 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828161451/http://www.conservatoriomcoimbra.pt/ |url-status=live }}</ref> the music-related departments of the [[Associação Académica de Coimbra]] and the music programmes of the Faculty of Humanities of the University of Coimbra are regularly cited among the top music schools in the country.
