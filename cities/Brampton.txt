'''Brampton''' is a city in the Canadian [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[Ontario]]. It is part of the [[Greater Toronto Area]] (GTA) and is a [[List of municipalities in Ontario#Lower-tier municipalities|lower-tier municipality]] within the [[Regional Municipality of Peel|Peel Region]]. The city has a population of 656,480 as of the [[2021 Canadian census|2021 Census]], making it the [[List of the largest municipalities in Canada by population|ninth most populous municipality]] in Canada and the third most populous city in the [[Greater Golden Horseshoe]] urban area, behind [[Toronto]] and [[Mississauga]]. The City of Brampton is bordered by [[Vaughan]] to the east, [[Halton Hills]] to the west, [[Caledon, Ontario|Caledon]] to the north, Mississauga to the south, and Etobicoke (Toronto) to the southeast.

Named after the town of [[Brampton, Carlisle|Brampton]] in [[Cumberland]], England, Brampton was incorporated as a village in 1853 and as a town in 1873, and became a city in 1974.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Brampton {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/brampton|access-date=2021-06-03|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca}}</ref> The modern City of Brampton was formed following an [[Merger (politics)|amalgamation]] of several surrounding townships and communities. 

The city was once known as "The Flower Town of Canada", a title referring to its abundance of greenhouses and strong [[floriculture]] industry in the 1860s.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=2017-04-21 |title=Why is Brampton Called the Flower City? |url=https://www.insauga.com/why-is-brampton-called-the-flower-city/ |access-date=2024-05-26 |website=InSauga |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Brampton History |url=https://www.brampton.ca/EN/Arts-Culture-Tourism/Tourism-Brampton/Visitors/pages/bramptonhistory.aspx |access-date=2024-05-26 |website=City of Brampton |language=en-US}}</ref> It maintains the term "Flower City" as its slogan. 

In recent times, the city has experienced large population growth. Despite being built as a [[Car dependency|car-centric]] city, Brampton has a significant [[Brampton Transit|transit]] system, with a ridership of 49,200,800, or about 226,500 per weekday as of the second quarter of 2024. Notably, the city is majority populated by people of [[South Asia|South Asian]] origin.

Before the arrival of British settlers, the [[Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation]] held {{Convert|648,000|acre|ha}} of land north of the head of the [[Toronto Purchase|Lake Purchase]] lands and extending to the unceded territory of the [[Chippewa]] of Lakes Huron and Simcoe.<ref name=":2" /> European settlers began to arrive in the area in the 1600s.

Prior to the 1830s, most business in [[Chinguacousy Township, Ontario|Chinguacousy Township]] took place at Martin Salisbury's tavern. One mile from the corner of [[Hurontario Street]] and the 5th Sideroad (now [[List of roads in Brampton#Main Street|Main]] and [[List of roads in Brampton#Queen Street|Queen]] Streets in the centre of Brampton), William Buffy's tavern was the only significant building. At the time, the intersection was referred to as "Buffy's Corners". By 1834, John Elliott laid out the area in lots for sale, calling it "Brampton", which was soon adopted by others.<ref name="100years">"Brampton's Beginning" in ''Bramptons's 100th Anniversary as an Incorporated Town: 1873–1973'', Brampton: The Corporation of the Town of Brampton and the Brampton Centennial Committee, 1973, originally published in Ross Cumming, ed., ''Historical Atlas of Peel County'', n.p.: Walker and Miles, 1877.</ref>

In 1853, a small agricultural fair was set up by the newly initiated County Agricultural Society of the County of Peel and was held at the corner of Main and Queen streets.{{cn|date=April 2024}} Grains, produce, roots, and dairy products were up for sale. Horses and cattle, along with other lesser livestock, were also sold at the market. This agricultural fair eventually became the modern [[Brampton Fall Fair]].

In that same year, Brampton was incorporated as a village.<ref name=100years /> In 1866, the town became the county seat and the location of the [[Peel County Courthouse]] which was built in 1865–66; a three-storey County jail was added at the rear in 1867.

A federal grant had enabled the village to found its first public [[library]] in 1887, which included 360 volumes from the Mechanic's Institute (established in 1858).{{cn|date=April 2024}} In 1907, the library received a grant from the Carnegie Foundation, set up by United States steel [[magnate]] and [[philanthropist]] [[Andrew Carnegie]], to build a new, expanded library; it serves several purposes, featuring the [[Brampton Library]]. The [[Carnegie libraries]] were built on the basis of communities coming up with matching funds and guaranteeing maintenance.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

In 1902, Sir [[William James Gage|William J. Gage]] (owner of Gage Publishing, a publishing house specializing in school textbooks) purchased a {{convert|3.25|acre|adj=on}} portion of the gardens and lawns of the Alder Lea estate (now called Alderlea) that had been built on Main Street by Kenneth Chisolm in 1867 to 1870. (Chisholm, a merchant and founding father of Brampton, had been the Town reeve, then warden of Peel County, then MPP for Brampton and eventually, Registrar of Peel County.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/chisholm_kenneth_13E.html|title=Biography – CHISHOLM, KENNETH – Volume XIII (1901-1910) – Dictionary of Canadian Biography |access-date=2 December 2017}}</ref> Gage donated {{convert|1.7|acre}} of the property to the town, with a specific condition that it be made into a park.

A group of regional farmers in Brampton had trouble getting insurance from city-based companies. After several meetings in Clairville Hall, they decided to found the County of Peel Farmers Mutual Fire Insurance Company.{{cn|date=April 2024}} In 1955, when the company moved to its third and current location, 103 Queen Street West, it took the new name of Peel Mutual Insurance Company. It reigns as the longest-running company in modern Brampton. Harmsworth Decorating Centre was established in 1890, as Harmsworth and Son, operated out of the family's house on Queen Street West.{{cn|date=April 2024}} The current location was purchased on September 1, 1904, after a fire destroyed their original store. Purchased for $1,400, the 24 Main Street South location is the longest-operating retail business in what is now Brampton.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

In 1974, the two townships of Chinguacousy and Toronto Gore were incorporated into Brampton. The small pine added to the centre of the shield on the Brampton city flag represents Chinguacousy, honouring the [[Chippewa]] chief ''Shinguacose,'' "The Small Pine." After this merger, outlying communities such as [[Bramalea, Ontario|Bramalea]], [[Heart Lake (Ontario)|Heart Lake]] and [[Professor's Lake]], [[Snelgrove, Ontario|Snelgrove]], [[Tullamore, Ontario|Tullamore]], and [[Marysfield]], were incorporated into the City, and in some instances further developed.

In 1963, the town established ''The Flower Festival of Brampton'', based on the ''[[Portland Rose Festival|Rose Festival]]'' of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]], in the United States. It began to market itself as the ''Flower Town of Canada''.<ref name="bost">{{cite web

===Development of Bramalea===

Planned as an innovative "[[new town]]", Bramalea was developed in the 1960s immediately east of the Town of Brampton in Chinguacousy Township. It was Canada's first satellite community developed by one of the country's largest real estate developers, ''Bramalea Limited.''<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brampton History |url=https://www.brampton.ca/EN/Arts-Culture-Tourism/Tourism-Brampton/Visitors/Pages/BramptonHistory.aspx#:~:text=In%20the%20late%201950s,%20Bramalea,parks,%20commercial%20business%20and%20industry. |access-date=2023-12-06 |website=www.brampton.ca |language=en}}</ref> The name "Bramalea" was created by the farmer William Sheard, who combined "BRAM" from Brampton, "MAL" from Malton (then a neighbouring town which is now part of the city of [[Mississauga]]), and "LEA", an [[Old English]] word meaning meadow or grassland. He sold the land to Brampton Leasing (the former name of the developer) and built one of Bramalea's first houses on Dixie Road.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}

The community was developed according to its detailed [[Strategic planning|master plan]], which included provisions for a parkland trail system and a "downtown" to include essential services and a [[shopping centre]].{{cn|date=April 2024}} The downtown's centrepiece was the Civic Centre, built in 1972 to include the city hall and library. Directly across Team Canada Drive, a shopping centre, [[Bramalea City Centre]] was built. These developments were connected by a long tunnel, planned to provide protection from winter weather. The tunnel has long since been closed due to safety issues.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

In 1974, the Ontario provincial government decided to update [[Peel County, Ontario|Peel County]]'s structure. It amalgamated several towns and villages into the new City of Mississauga. In addition, it created the present City of Brampton from the town and the greater portion of the Townships of Chinguacousy and [[Toronto Gore Township, Ontario|Toronto Gore]], and the northern extremity of Mississauga south of [[Steeles Avenue]],<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.bramptonguardian.com/living-story/5763940-brampton-s-historic-churchville-village-turns-200/| work=Pam Douglas |title=Brampton's historic Churchville village turns 200|date=July 28, 2015 |publisher=Brampton Guardian |access-date=August 12, 2020}}</ref> including Bramalea and the other communities such as [[Churchville, Brampton|Churchville]], Claireville, Ebenezer, Victoria, Springbrook, [[Coleraine, Ontario|Coleraine]], and Huttonville. While only Huttonville and Churchville still exist as identifiable communities, other names like Claireville are re-emerging as names of new developments.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

The province converted Peel County into the [[Peel Regional Municipality, Ontario|Regional Municipality of Peel]]. Brampton retained its role as the administrative centre of Peel Region, which it already had as [[county seat]]. The regional council chamber, the [[Peel Regional Police]] force, the public health department, and the region's only major museum, the [[Peel Art Gallery, Museum and Archives]], are all located in Brampton.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}

This change had its critics among those with a strong sense of local identities. Bramptonians feared urban sprawl would dissolve their town's personality. Bramalea residents took pride in the built-from-scratch and organised structure that had come with their new satellite city and did not want to give it up. Others in Bramalea accept they are part of Brampton, and they make up a "tri-city" area: the original Brampton, Heart Lake, Bramalea.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}

In 1972, Chinguacousy built a new civic centre in Bramalea. Two years later, when Brampton and Chinguacousy merged, the new city's council was moved from its modest downtown Brampton locale to the Bramalea building. The library systems of Brampton and Chinguacousy were merged, resulting in a system of four locations.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}

Some have questioned the [[Regional Municipality of Peel, Ontario#The Region's future|future of Peel Region]] as encompassing all of Brampton, Mississauga, and Caledon. The Mississauga council, led by Mayor [[Hazel McCallion]], voted to become a single-tier municipality and asked the provincial government to be separated from Peel Region. They argued the city has outgrown the need for a regional layer of government, and that Mississauga is being held back by supporting Brampton and Caledon with its municipal taxes.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}

In the early 1980s, [[Cineplex Odeon]] closed the Capitol Theatre in Brampton. The City bought the facility in 1981 under the leadership of councillor Diane Sutter. It adapted the former [[vaudeville]] venue and movie house as a performing arts theatre, to be used also as a live music venue. It was renamed the Heritage Theatre. Renovations and maintenance were expensive.{{cn|date=April 2024}} In 1983, Toronto consultants Woods Gordon reported to the City that, rather than continue "pouring money" into the Heritage, they should construct a new 750-seat facility with up-to-date features.{{cn|date=April 2024}} This recommendation was adopted, and the city designated the 2005–06 season as the Heritage Theatre's "grand finale" season. The city funded construction of the new [[Rose Theatre, Brampton|Rose Theatre]], which opened in September 2006.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}

Carabram was founded in 1982, the result of volunteers from different ethnic communities wanting to organize a festival celebrating diversity and cross-cultural friendship. The name was loosely related to Toronto's Caravan Festival of Cultures. Carabram's first event featured [[Italy|Italian]], [[Scottish people|Scots]], [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], and [[West Indian]] pavilions. By 2003, the fair had 18 pavilions attracting 45,000 visitors.{{cn|date=April 2024}} 

Brampton has grown to become one of the most diverse cities in Canada. In 1996, the city was 13% South Asian and 8.2% black.<ref name="1996census">{{cite web |publisher=Statistics Canada |title=Electronic Area Profiles: Brampton |website=www12.statcan.gc.ca |date=October 29, 1998 |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/english/census96/data/profiles/Rp-eng.cfm?TABID=2&LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GID=202027&GK=0&GRP=1&PID=35782&PRID=0&PTYPE=3&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=0&Temporal=1996&THEME=34&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=&D1=0&D2=0&D3=0&D4=0&D5=0&D6=0 |access-date=March 7, 2019}}</ref> By 2016, the South Asian community grew significantly to represent 44.3% of the city's population, while the black population grew to 14%.<ref name="ReferenceB">Census Profile, 2016 Census
Brampton, Ontario, and Peel, Regional Municipality, Ontario</ref> Responding to a growing multi-cultural population, the Peel Board of Education introduced evening [[English language learning and teaching|English as a Second Language]] (ESL) classes at high schools. Originally taught by volunteers, the classes eventually were scheduled as daytime courses taught by paid instructors. In the 1980s, the public and Catholic board expanded its language programs, offering night classes in 23 languages. These were introduced due to requests by parents, who wanted their children to learn their ancestral languages and heritage.

In the late 1980s, Mayor [[Ken Whillans]] gained approval and funding for the construction of [[Brampton City Hall|a new city hall]] in Brampton's downtown. The facility was designed by local architects and built on the site of a former bus terminal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inzola.com/construction/portfolio/brampton-city-hall/ |title=Brampton City Hall |work=Inzola Construction (Portfolio) |access-date=April 26, 2024}}</ref> Whillians did not get to see the opening of the new hall in June 1991 because of his death in August 1990.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brampton.ca/EN/Arts-Culture-Tourism/Festivals-and-Events/Brampton-50|website=Brampton.ca|title=Celebrating Brampton's 50th Birthday: ''A Look Back in Time''|access-date=April 26, 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Brampton Guardian |url=https://www.bramptonguardian.com/news/former-brampton-mayor-ken-whillans-remembered-on-25th-anniversary-of-drowning/article_2bb13511-be74-5512-95de-119c2157366c.html |title=Former Brampton mayor Ken Whillans remembered on 25th anniversary of drowning |date=August 24, 2015 |access-date=April 24, 2024}}</ref> Its completion brought the municipal government back to downtown Brampton.

In 1991, development of another new town, [[Springdale, Brampton|Springdale]], began. In 1999, development started to appear as far north as the city's border with Caledon along Mayfield Road. The Region designated this border as the line of demarcation for urban development until 2021, although development already began spilling north of Mayfield in the late 2010s.{{cn|date=April 2024}} Part of the boundary between Brampton and [[Vaughan, Ontario|Vaughan]] is also nearly completely urbanized.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

Changes continue to reflect the growth of the city. In 1992 the City purchased the Brampton Fairgrounds, to be used for other development. The Agricultural Society relocated in 1997 outside the boundaries of the city to Heart Lake and Old School roads.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

Brampton's 2003 Sesquicentennial celebrations boosted community spirit, reviving the tradition of a summer parade (with 100 floats), and creating other initiatives.{{cn|date=April 2024}} To commemorate the town's history, the city under Mayor Fennell reintroduced floral projects to the community. These have included more plantings around town, the revival in 2005 of the city Parade, and participation in the Canada [[Communities in Bloom]] project.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

===Media===
{{main|Media in Peel}}
Brampton was one of the first areas where [[Rogers Cable]] offered its service. The city started a community access channel in the 1970s, which still operates. While some programs on the channel are produced in its Brampton studios, most are based in its Mississauga location. Christian specialty channel [[Vertical TV]] is based in Brampton.

''[[The Brampton Guardian]]'' is the community's only newspaper, starting as the Bramalea Guardian in 1964. The city's first newspaper, ''The Daily Times'', stopped circulation in the early 1980s. For a little over a year, ''The Brampton Bulletin'' attempted to challenge the ''Guardian'', but it was dismantled after a series of editor changes.

Brampton is the official [[city of license]] for two radio stations, [[CHLO (AM)|CHLO]] and [[CFNY-FM|CFNY]]. Both stations address their programming toward the entire [[Greater Toronto Area]] rather than exclusively to Brampton. CFNY was located upstairs at 83 Kennedy Road until moving to Toronto in 1996.
