'''Lahti''' ({{IPA|fi|ˈlɑhti}}; {{langx|sv|Lahtis}}) is a [[city]] in [[Finland]] and the regional capital of [[Päijät-Häme]]. It is located in the [[Finnish Lakeland]]. The population of Lahti is approximately {{formatnum:{{#expr:{{Data Finland municipality/population count|{{PAGENAME}}}}round -3}}}}, while the [[Lahti sub-region|sub-region]] has a population of approximately {{formatnum: {{#expr: {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Lahti}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Asikkala}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Hartola}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Heinola}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Hollola}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Iitti}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Kärkölä}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Orimattila}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Padasjoki}} + {{Data Finland municipality/population count|Sysmä}}round -3}}}}. It is the {{ordinal|{{Data Finland municipality/population count sequence|{{PAGENAME}}}}}} most populous [[Municipalities of Finland|municipality]] in Finland, and the sixth most populous [[List of urban areas in Finland by population|urban area]] in the country.

Lahti is situated on a bay at the southern end of lake [[Vesijärvi]] about {{convert|100|km|-1}} north-east of the capital city [[Helsinki]], {{convert|38|km}} south-west of [[Heinola]] and {{convert|74|km}} east of [[Hämeenlinna]], the capital of the region of [[Tavastia Proper|Tavastia Proper (Kanta-Häme)]]. Lahti is situated at the intersection of [[Finnish national road 4|Highway 4]] (between Helsinki and [[Jyväskylä]]) and [[Finnish national road 12|Highway 12]] (between [[Tampere]] and [[Kouvola]]), which are the most significant main roads of Lahti. Its neighboring municipalities are [[Asikkala]], Heinola, [[Hollola]], [[Iitti]] and [[Orimattila]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kuntaliitto.fi/kunnat/lahti|title=Kunnat: Lahti|publisher=Kuntaliitto|access-date=6 August 2024|language=fi}}</ref>

In English, the Finnish word Lahti literally means ''bay''. Lahti is also dubbed the "[[Chicago]] of Finland" due to the similarity of early industries of both cities, when they were known as "[[slaughterhouse|slaughterhouse cities]]".<ref name="chicago">[https://lahtifringe.fi/7-interesting-facts-about-lahti/ 7 Interesting Facts about Lahti]</ref><ref name="chicago1">[https://www.ess.fi/paikalliset/487340 Lahti on Suomen Chicago – syystäkin] (in Finnish)</ref><ref name="chicago2">[https://www.studio55.fi/matkailu/article/onko-lahti-oikeasti-suomen-chicago-poliisi-kertoo/129346 Onko Lahti oikeasti "Suomen Chicago"?

Lahti is a long-time pioneering city in environmental sustainability, dating back to as early as 1990 and before. The [[European Commission]] has named Lahti as the [[European Green Capital]] of 2021.<ref>[https://greenlahti.fi/en Lahti – European Green Capital 2021]</ref><ref>[https://ec.europa.eu/environment/europeangreencapital/winning-cities/2021-lahti/ European Green Capital: 2021 – Lahti]</ref> <!-- Some inacceptably-minded person had glued the preceding sentence to the one about criminality to make it be easily overlooked. -->

Lahti is the headquarters of the Salpausselkä UNESCO Global Geopark,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://visitlahti.fi/en/frontpage/salpausselka-geopark/|title=Salpausselkä Geopark|access-date=20 January 2023}}</ref> one of 4 UNESCO Geoparks in Finland.

The [[coat of arms]] of the city depicts a train wheel surrounded by flames. It refers to the [[Riihimäki–Saint Petersburg railway]], which had a decisive influence on the birth of the city at its crossroads.<ref>{{cite book| title= Suomen kunnallisvaakunat | publisher= Suomen Kunnallisliitto | year= 1982 | page= 118 | isbn= 951-773-085-3 | language=fi}}</ref>

==History==
Lahti was first mentioned in documents in 1445. The village belonged to the [[parish]] of [[Hollola]] and was located at the medieval trade route of [[Ylinen Viipurintie]], which linked the towns of [[Hämeenlinna]] and [[Vyborg|Viipuri]].

[[File:Alfred-Caweenin-asemaaka-vuodelta-1878.jpg|thumb|left|Lahti town plan from 1878 by Alfred Caween.]]
[[File:Lahti old map.jpg|thumb|left|A map of Lahti made by Nils Westermark in 1750–52]]
The completion of the [[Riihimäki-Saint Petersburg railroad|Riihimäki – St. Petersburg railway line]] in 1870 and the [[Vesijärvi]] canal in 1871 turned Lahti into a lively station, and industrial installations began to spring up around it. For a long time, the railway station at Vesijärvi Harbour was the second busiest station in Finland. Craftsmen, merchants, a few civil servants and a lot of industrial workers soon mixed in with the existing agricultural peasantry.

On 19 June 1877, almost the entire village was burned to the ground. However, the accident proved to be a stroke of luck for the development of the place, as it led to the authorities resuming their deliberations about establishing a town in Lahti. The village was granted [[market town]] rights by Emperor [[Alexander II of Russia]] in 1878<ref name="charter"/> and an empire-style, grid town plan was approved, which included a large market square and wide [[boulevard]]s. This grid plan still forms the basis of the city center. Most of the buildings were low wooden houses bordering the streets.

Lahti was founded during a period of severe economic recessions. The [[Russian Empire]] was encumbered by the war against [[Turkey]], which also affected the economy of the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]]. The recession also slowed down building of the township: land would not sell and often plots were not built on for some time. In its early years, the town with its meagre 200 inhabitants was too small to provide any kind of foundation for trade. At the end of the 1890s, Lahti's Township Board increased its efforts to enable Lahti to be turned into a city. In spring 1904, the efforts finally bore fruit as the [[Governing Senate|Senate]] approved of the application, although it was another eighteen months before [[Tsar Nicholas II]] finally gave his blessing and issued an ordinance for establishing the city of Lahti.<ref name="tradicii"/>

At the end of 1905, the area that now comprises Lahti accommodated around 8,200 people of whom just under 3,000 lived in the city itself. All essential municipal institutions were built in just ten years, including a hospital and a city hall. At the same time, a rapid increase in brick houses was taking place in the centre of the city. The [[Battle of Lahti]] was fought in the 1918 [[Finnish Civil War]] as the German [[Detachment Brandenstein]] took the town from the [[Red Guards (Finland)|Reds]].

In the early 1920s, the city gained possession of the grounds of the Lahti Manor, an important piece of land previously blocking the city from the lake. Large-scale industrial operations grew rapidly in the 1930s as did the population; Lahti, at the time, was one of Finland's fastest-growing cities, and before the start of the [[Winter War]] its population was approaching 30,000.

Through the addition of new areas in 1924, 1933 and 1956, Lahti grew, both in terms of population and surface area. The increase in population was especially strong after [[Finland in World War II|WWII]], when 10,000 evacuees from [[Moscow Armistice|ceded territories]] to the [[Soviet Union]] were settled in the city, and then later in the 1960s and 1970s as a result of urbanization. The rapid population growth came to a sharp end in 1975 and the city has since grown significantly slower albeit more steadily, with the latest notable growth in population happening in 2016 when the municipality of [[Nastola]] became a part of Lahti.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Uuskallio|first1=Vili|title="Lahden ja Nastolan liitoksesta seurannut jotain hyvääkin"|url=https://www.ess.fi/paikalliset/726674|work=[[Etelä-Suomen Sanomat]]|accessdate=7 August 2022|language=fi|date=29 December 2016}}</ref>

In December 2018, Lahti became the first new university city in Finland after [[Rovaniemi]] in 1979 when the Parliament accepted a change in the university law. [[LUT University]] nowadays consists of two campuses, [[Lappeenranta]] and Lahti.

== Geography ==
[[File:Lake_Vesijärvi_panorama.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vesijärvi|Lake Vesijärvi]] seen from Lahti]]
The terrain of Lahti is dominated by the first [[Salpausselkä]] ridge, a terminal [[moraine]] that cuts through the city from west to east. The city is located in the transition from the southern coastal area to the [[Finnish Lakeland]]; prominent to the north of the Salpausselkä are rocky hills and fragmented lakes, while its south side is dominated by forests and small rivers. The divide is also apparent in the soil, which mostly consists of [[till]] in the north and [[clay]] in the south.<ref name="finlandia">{{Cite book|last1=Huovinen|first1=Pentti|last2=Rikkinen|first2=Kalevi|last3=Sihvo|first3=Hannes|title=Finlandia: Otavan iso maammekirja, osa 3: Häme ja Pirkanmaa|publisher=[[Otava (publisher)|Otava]]|year=1984|isbn=951-1-07914-X|location=[[Helsinki]]|pages=108–116|language=fi}}</ref> The biggest lake is [[Vesijärvi]] which also is a gateway to [[Central Finland]] via [[Lake Päijänne]]. There is also a [[pond]] called [[Pikku-Vesijärvi]] ("Little Vesijärvi") near the [[Lanu-puisto]] park.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.puhdasvesijarvi.fi/easydata/customers/puhdasvesijarvi/files/pienjarvet/pienjarvet_selvitys.pdf |title=Lahden pienten jarvien veden laadun tutkimuksia 30 vuotta |publisher=Puhdasvesijarvi.fi |access-date=2020-12-22 |language=fi |archive-date=2013-09-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925081518/http://www.puhdasvesijarvi.fi/easydata/customers/puhdasvesijarvi/files/pienjarvet/pienjarvet_selvitys.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Subdivisions ===
The area of the city of Lahti is divided in two ways: first, the 40 individually numbered districts ({{langx|fi|kaupunginosa}}),<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Lahti map service: Quarters of Lahti City|url=https://kartta.lahti.fi/ims/en?layers=Tourist%20map&lon=Quarters%20of%20Lahti%20City&cp=6763872,26483496&z=8|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=17 January 2021|website=|publisher=City of Lahti}}</ref> and second, the 9 greater areas ({{langx|fi|suuralue}}), which are divided into 41 statistical districts ({{langx|fi|tilastollinen kaupunginosa}}) and further into 169 statistical areas ({{langx|fi|tilastoalue}}).<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Statistics service of the City of Lahti|url=http://www4.lahti.fi/verkkotilastointi/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706021100/http://www4.lahti.fi/verkkotilastointi/|archive-date=6 July 2008|access-date=17 January 2021|website=|language=fi|url-status=dead}}</ref> The definitions of the districts and statistical districts do not necessarily match each other.

{{As of|2023}}, there were 11,552 persons with a migrant background living in Lahti, or 9.6% of the population.{{refn|Statistics Finland classifies a person as having a "foreign background" if both parents or the only known parent were born abroad.<ref name="statistics-finland-persons-with-foreign-background">{{cite web |access-date=18 September 2023 |title=Persons with foreign background |publisher=Statistics Finland | url=https://www.stat.fi/tup/maahanmuutto/maahanmuuttajat-vaestossa/ulkomaalaistaustaiset_en.html}}</ref>|group=note}} The number of residents who were born abroad was 10,919, or 9.0 per cent of the population. The number of persons with foreign citizenship living in Lahti was 7,272.<ref name="statistics-finland-population-2023-final"/> Most foreign-born citizens came from the [[Soviet Union|former Soviet Union]], [[Estonia]], [[Iraq]] and [[Russia]].<ref name="Stat-finland-population-38,000-persons"/>

The relative share of immigrants in Lahti's population is close to the national average. Furthermore, the city's new residents are increasingly of foreign origin. This will increase the proportion of foreign residents in the coming years.

=== Religion ===

In 2023, the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland|Evangelical Lutheran Church]] was the largest religious group with 60.6% of the population of Lahti. Other religious groups accounted for 2.9% of the population. 36.5% of the population had no religious affiliation.<ref>[https://pxdata.stat.fi/PXWeb/pxweb/en/StatFin/StatFin__vaerak/statfin_vaerak_pxt_11ra.px Key figures on population by region, 1990-2023] Statistics Finland</ref>

==Economy==
The economic region of Lahti, which includes the surrounding municipalities, was strongly affected by the collapse of Finnish-Soviet trade and by the recession in the early 1990s. The value of production slumped, especially in the mechanical engineering industry and other manufacturing industries (e.g. the furniture industry). Production also decreased in the textile and clothing industry. In 1990, there were 90,370 jobs in the Lahti region. The number of jobs diminished over the next couple of years, so that in 1993 there were fewer than 70,000 jobs in the region. The number of jobs had slowly increased to 79,138 in 1999.

==Culture==
[[File:Flea market port of Lahti.jpg|thumb|right|Flea market in the Lahti harbour, Sibelius Hall in the background.]]
Lahti harbors cultural ambitions, manifested notably in the construction of a large congress and concert centre, the [[Sibelius Hall]] (2000) by architects Kimmo Lintula and Hannu Tikka. Lahti has one of Finland's most widely known symphony orchestras, the [[Lahti Symphony Orchestra]] (''Sinfonia Lahti''&thinsp;), based at the Sibelius Hall, which performs both classical and popular music, notably concentrating on music by [[Jean Sibelius]]. The orchestra has won several well respected international prizes, and is often heard on [[BBC Radio 3]].

Lahti's annual music festival programme includes such events as Lahti Organ Festival, a jazz festival held in the city's market square and the Sibelius Festival.

[[File:Piano-paviljonki_Lahti.jpg|thumb|right|Piano Pavilion in Lahti harbour]]
In addition to the Sibelius Hall, other additional notable works of architecture in Lahti are the City Hall (1911) by [[Eliel Saarinen]], the [[Ristinkirkko, Lahti|Church of the Cross]] (1978) by [[Alvar Aalto]], [[:fi:Nastolan kirkko|Nastola Church]] (1804), the oldest church in the city, [[Joutjärvi church]], the City Theatre (1983) by [[Pekka Salminen]], the City Library (1990) by [[Arto Sipinen]], the Piano Pavilion (2008) by [[Gert Wingårdh]], and the Travel Centre (2016) by [[JKMM Architects]]. The City of Lahti has also acted as the host city for the international [[Spirit of Wood Architecture Award]], established in Finland in 1999. Some of the prize-winners have received commissions to design small structures in the city; these include small works by Japanese architect [[Kengo Kuma]] and Australian architect [[Richard Leplastrier]].

The Finnish folk metal band [[Korpiklaani]] was founded in Lahti.

[[File:Lahti view 7.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lahti Sports Center]]: the ski jumping hills, [[Lahti Stadium|Hiihtostadium]] and public outdoor swimming pool.]]

=== Winter sports ===
Lahti has a rich sporting tradition, especially in various wintersports. The city is well known for the annually held [[Lahti Ski Games]] (''Salpausselän kisat'') and the [[Finlandia-hiihto]] cross-country skiing contest. It is also the only city to host the [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships]] seven times, doing so in 1926, 1938, 1958, 1978, 1989, 2001 and 2017.

=== Ice hockey ===
The [[Lahti Pelicans|Pelicans]] have competed in the top level of Finnish [[ice hockey]], the [[SM-liiga]], since 1999. Before the new millennium [[Reipas Lahti|Reipas]] represented Lahti in top-flight hockey for 50 years. Many former [[National Hockey League|NHL]] players, such as [[Janne Laukkanen]], [[Toni Lydman]] and [[Pasi Nurminen]], have started their careers in Reipas.

=== Association football ===
Historically the city's most successful association football club has been [[FC Kuusysi|Kuusysi]]. In their golden years lasting from the early 1980s to the 1990s they won five Finnish championships as well as two [[Finnish Cup]] titles, with appearances in European competitions each year. Their greatest rivals, Reipas, won a total of three championships and seven cup titles from 1963 to 1978 but diminished in the early 1980s as Kuusysi got stronger.

In the 1990s both clubs ended up in such massive financial difficulties that a merger was executed in 1996, with the newly formed club adopting a new name, crest and colours. [[FC Lahti]] has played in the [[Veikkausliiga]] since 1999, excluding a season-long visit to the first division in 2011, having placed twice third and appearing in Europe three times.

=== Other events ===
The Kärpänen [[motorcycle speedway]] track existed from circa.1950 to circa.1980, it was located where the Kärpäsen koulu sports field is today and hosted a qualifying round of the [[Speedway World Championship]] in 1957<ref>{{cite web | title = History Speedway and Longtrack | publisher = Speedway.org | url = http://www.speedway.org/history/ | access-date = 18 January 2024 }}</ref> in addition to the [[Finnish Individual Speedway Championship|Finnish Speedway Championship]], multiple times between the years 1963 and 1978.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.speedwaysanomat.fi/tekstit/tilastot_sm.html |title=Speedway Individual Finnish Championship |website=Speedway Sanomat |access-date=12 January 2023}}</ref> Another former speedway track at Pipoo (built in 1980),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.salpausselanmoottorikerho.fi/seuran-historia/ |title=Moottorin pärinää jo vuodesta 1928 | website=Salpausselanmoottorikerho |access-date=14 February 2024}}</ref> off the Vanhanradankatu held the final of the Finnish Championship in 1980, 1987 and 1990.

The [[World Games 1997|1997 World Games]] and the 2009 [[World Masters Athletics Championships]] were held in Lahti. For the [[1952 Summer Olympics]], some of the [[Football at the 1952 Summer Olympics|football]] matches were played at [[Lahden kisapuisto|Kisapuisto]].

Lahti will host the 2023 Ironman 70.3 World Championship August 26–27, an annual event which rotates venue and is the 2nd most important event in long course triathlon after Kona World Championship held annually in Hawaii.

==Transportation==
[[File:Railway station in Lahti of Finland.JPG|thumb| Railway station, built in 1935 and designed by architect [[Thure Hellström]].]]

=== Local transport ===
The city is served by 20 local bus lines, most of which are pendulum lines between two different areas via city centre. Bus transport in the Päijänne Tavastia region is organised by the regional transportation authority, known as [[Lahden seudun liikenne]] or ''LSL'', and run by several private companies which have bid for the right to run their lines. LSL buses cover all urban areas at 10–20 minute intervals and most nearby municipalities at 30–60 minute intervals.

Lahti is served by [[VR commuter rail]], the Z train to [[Helsinki Central railway station|Helsinki]] and the G train to [[Riihimäki railway station|Riihimäki]] run hourly. Most services to [[Kouvola railway station|Kouvola]] don't have a letter designation and are run every three hours aside from rush hours. There are plans for building two new train stops inside the city limits before 2020, [[Hennala]] and Karisto. A local service to [[Heinola railway station|Heinola]] has been proposed but renovating the old line has been deemed too expensive and unprofitable in the long term, unless the Finnish state reaches an agreement with regional councils to finance a direct rail link from Lahti to either [[Jyväskylä]] or [[Mikkeli]].

=== Long-distance transport ===
[[File:Lahti - Coach station.jpg|thumb|Bus station, built in 1939 and designed by architect [[Kaarlo Könönen]]. ]]
The city's main transportation hubs are the market square (''Kauppatori'') and the travel centre (''Matkakeskus)'', with local buses providing a non-stop service between the two. The travel centre, which replaced the old [[Lahti bus station]] that had been in use since 1939, was built between 2014 and 2016 around the [[Lahti railway station]] by building new local bus stops around the station, a long-distance bus terminal next to the station building and an automated parking facility for commuters.

All local and long-distance trains and buses stop at the travel centre, making it convenient to transfer from one mode of transport to another. The city council has sold the old bus station in the city centre and it will be redeveloped for other uses in the near future.

Lahti's proximity to [[Helsinki]] provides a fast and well-serviced operation between the cities. Long-distance and commuter trains service the city at least twice an hour in the daytime. There is also a commuter train service towards [[Riihimäki]] in the south-west and to [[Kouvola]] / [[Kotka]] in the east. All the east and north-east long-distance train services to and from [[Helsinki railway station]] call at Lahti. From Lahti, it is also convenient to travel to [[Helsinki airport]]. Travel time to Helsinki airport via [[Tikkurila station]] is between 49min to 65min.

Additionally to the train connections, the long-distance busses are well-serviced in Lahti. Thanks to its geographical location, Lahti provides a hub-like possibility for busses too. From Lahti, the long-distance busses service routes to Helsinki, [[Turku]], [[Tampere]], [[Jyväskylä]], [[Mikkeli]], [[Oulu]], [[Rovaniemi]] amongst the other destinations.

==Education==
[[File:Lahti - yhteiskoulu.jpg|thumb| Lahden yhteiskoulu from 1896]]
[[File:Lahden Kansanopiston torni.jpg|right|thumb| Lahti Folk High School]]

=== Comprehensive and private education ===
Lahti has 16 comprehensive schools and eight secondary schools. Comprehensive education is also available in English and Swedish.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Basic education|url=https://www.lahti.fi/en/services/basic-education|access-date=2020-08-22|website=Lahti.fi|language=en-US}}</ref> ''Lahden yhteiskoulu'' is the city's only private school offering both comprehensive and upper secondary education.

=== Upper secondary and vocational education ===
All four upper secondary schools in Lahti have a specialty: the Lyceum has expertise on subjects such as mathematics and biology, and sports (formerly in Salpauselkä), Tiirismaa focuses on music in association with the Lahti Conservatory, Kannas organises theatre classes and Lahden yhteiskoulu offers an economy-centered class.

Salpaus is an educational consortium owned by the municipalities in Päijänne Tavastia arranging most of the region's vocational education and trade schooling. The privately owned Dila and Lahti Conservatory educate students for healthcare and music-related professions, respectively.

=== Higher education and LUT University ===
Lahti's greatest educational assets are the [[Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT]] as well as also highly valued [[Lahti Institute of Design|Institute of Design and Fine Arts]], which is a part of [[LAB University of Applied Sciences]].

LUT University offers education in engineering science as well as in business and management. The Institute of Design and Fine Arts has gained international recognition in particular for jewelry and industrial design, while other areas of expertise include metal, woodworking and furniture.

There are two national sports institutes in greater Lahti. The [[Vierumäki]] International Sports Institute based in [[Heinola]] is the most versatile centre of sports and physical education in the country, operating under the Ministry of Culture and Education. In addition the [[Pajulahti Sports Institute]], located in the district of Nastola in Lahti, is one of the leading sports and training centres in Finland.

Furthermore one of Finland's six multidisciplinary university campuses is based in Lahti. The [[University of Helsinki]]'s Department of Environmental Sciences is the university's sole science department located outside the [[Helsinki metropolitan area]].

[[File:Lahti - Level of Education.png]]

==Trivia==
The [[asteroid]] [[1498 Lahti]] was named after the city by its discoverer, the Finnish [[astronomer]] [[Yrjö Väisälä]].

The radio masts on top of the ''[[Radio Hill (Lahti)|Radiomäki]]'' are {{convert|150|m}} tall.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lahti Transmission Towers |url=https://structurae.net/en/structures/lahti-transmission-towers |website=Structurae.net |access-date=6 December 2020}}</ref>

Lahti won the [[European Green Capital Award]] of the year 2021.

Although the [[Institute for the Languages of Finland]] recommend for [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]] to use the Swedish names for all Finnish towns, the use of Lahtis in those countries is almost non-existent even among major newssites,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/tromsogfinnmark/sprakradet-far-pepper-for-a-anbefale-svenske-stedsnavn-i-finland-1.15700743|title=Språkrådet ber deg si Helsingfors, ikke Helsinki: – Idiotisk og latterlig|language=nb|access-date=13 December 2023|date=24 October 2021|publisher=[[NRK]]}}</ref> especially as a result of Lahti being the branding name used for skiing events held there.
