'''Sehore''' is a city and a [[municipality]] in [[Sehore district]] in the Indian [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. It is the district headquarters of Sehore District and is located on the [[Bhopal]]-[[Sehore district|Sehore]]-[[Indore]] highway, 38&nbsp;km from Bhopal.

==History==
Sehore stands at the foothills of the [[Vindhya Range]]  in the middle of the [[Malwa]] region. It has a long and glorious past. [[Shaiva]], [[Shakta]], [[Jain]], [[Vaishnav]], [[Buddhist]]s and [[Nath]] priests made Sehore a significant seat of meditation/ worship. Sehore was a part of the Bhopal estate. After formation of [[Madhya Pradesh]], it was bifurcated, in 1972 and a new district - Bhopal - was carved out of it.

Ancient lore states that [[Patanjali|Maharshi Patanjali]], the illustrious founder of a [[Yoga]] sect, also spent some time here in prayer, penance and worship. Folklore also points to the visits of [[Lord Rama]], [[Laxman]] and [[Sita]] to different places in and around Sehore. Sehore has many temples, Mutts, Shrines, Mosques and Churches of historical antiquity and religious significance. Sehore, thus, boasts of a glorious tradition of communal harmony and culture.

''Sidhhapur'' is the old name of Sehore{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}.  According to a rock-edict found in the Seevan river, it got its name from   ''Sidrapur''{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}. According to an old document, Sehore got its name from the Anglo-Indian corruption of ''Sher'' or Lion as pronounced by the British, since lions or "Sher"s were in abundance in the nearby jungles{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}.

Sehore has been an integral part of Awanti. Later on, it was under the tutelage of the [[Magadha (Mahajanapada)|Magadh dynasty]], Chandragupta I, [[Harshavardhan]], [[Ashoka]], [[Raja Bhoj]], [[Peshwa]] chiefs, Rani Kamlapati and the Nawabs of the Bhopal dynasty. Sehore remained the headquarters of the political agent and resident of the [[British Raj]] till Indian independence in 1947.

Rivers big and small abound in the landscape of Sehore. [[Narmada River|Narmada]], Parwati, Dudhi, Newaj, Kolar, Papnas, Kulans, Seewan, Lotia and other rivers tell a sad tale of lost splendor in the form of scattered idols found in them. Idols of Lord Vishnu, Ganesha, Shiva, Parvati, Nandi, Garuda, Lord Mahavira, Gautam Buddha, Apsaras and fairies have been found in different forms and postures.

During the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], Sehore revolted against [[Company rule in India|Company rule]]; in response, Robert Hamilton led a detachment of the [[Bombay Army]] which restored Company control over the town from the rebels, which included mutinying sepoys from the [[Presidency armies]]. Hundreds of rebels were captured, put on trial and executed by [[hanging]] or [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]] for their role in the rebellion. The [[Nawabs of Bhopal|Nawab of Bhopal]], [[Sikandar Begum]], refused to join the rebellion, which played a major role in assisting its suppression in the region.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
 
On 15 August 1947, [[Indian Independence Act 1947|India became independent from British colonial rule]]. But the estate of Bhopal did not merge with the India state till 1949 and even that after a fierce struggle. Sehore has honorable mention in the fields of academics and literature. Lanciet Likinson, the political agent, got written the first English translation of ''[[Shakuntala (play)|Abhijñānaśākuntalam]]'' in 1835–40.

The High School of Sehore founded in 1835 by political agent Likinson, had to its credit, students like Hidayatullah (former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and Vice President of India) and Banchu (Ex-chief justice) Mirza Faim Begh (chief engineer).
