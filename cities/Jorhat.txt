{{Main article|Konbaung dynasty}}
[[File:Statute of Maha Bandula.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Maha Bandula]] who led the [[Royal Burmese armed forces|Burmese forces]] to Jorhat]]
The town was occupied by the Burmese [[Konbaung dynasty]] between 1817 - 1825. The Burmese left the commander Mingimaha Tilwa in charge of the area who appointed [[Jogeswar Singha]] as the new puppet King in 1821 in Jorhat.<ref>"Meanwhile the Burmese king Badawpaya died in May 1819 leaving his grandson Bagidaw to the throne of Burma. Bagidawa desired that Assam be a permanent part of Burmese empire. Hence in 1821 Tilwa who had since returned to Burma was sent back to reclaim Assam. Tilwa occupied places like Jorhat and set up Jogeshwar Singha as the new King of Assam. With this the Burmese became the de facto ruler of the country."{{harvcol|Nag|2018|pp=13–14}}</ref> Later when the deposed king [[Chandrakanta Singha]] tried to fight back, [[Bagyidaw]] (1819 – 1837), the seventh King of Burma sent the greatest of his generals [[Maha Bandula|Mingimaha Bandula]] with 20,000 troops<ref name="harvcol|Nag|2018|pp=13–14">{{harvcol|Nag|2018|pp=13–14}}</ref> (including 10,000 [[Khamti people|Kamti]] [[Shan States|Shan]] and [[Kachin people|Kachin]] [[Feudal levies|levies]] who were chieftains of [[Mongkawng]] and [[Hukawng Valley|Hukawng]])  who defeated Chandrakanta Singha at Mahgarh near Jorhat and reestablished Burmese authority in Assam. The defeat of Chandrakanta on 12 June 1822 marks the start of the Burmese rule in Assam.<ref>"When the deposed king Chandra kanta tried to fight back Bagidaw sent the greatest of his generals Mingimaha Bandula to reestablish Burmese authority in Assam. The defeat of Chandrakanta on June 12, 1822 marked the end of Ahom rule in Assam."{{harvcol|Nag|2018|p=14}}</ref> and Burmese commander Mingimaha  Tilwa was made the king.
