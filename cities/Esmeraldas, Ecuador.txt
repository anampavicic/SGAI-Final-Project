'''Esmeraldas''' ({{IPA|es|esmeˈɾaldas}}) is a coastal city in northwestern [[Ecuador]]. It is the seat of the [[Esmeraldas Canton]] and capital of the [[Esmeraldas Province]]. It has an international sea [[port]] and a small airport ([[IATA location identifier]]: ESM). Esmeraldas is the major seaport of northwestern Ecuador, and it lies on the Pacific coast at the mouth of the [[Esmeraldas River]]. It is the [[antipodes]] of [[Padang, Indonesia]]. The city is the principal trading hub for the region's agricultural and lumber resources, and is the terminus of the 313-mile (504-km) Trans-Ecuadorian Pipeline from the oil fields in northeastern Ecuador.

Esmeraldas is well known around Latin America given the large number of locals that have historically played in the [[Ecuador national football team]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elcomercio.com/deportes/esmeraldenos-integran-Seleccion-ecuatoriana_0_889711188.html|title=Siete esmeraldeños integran la Selección ecuatoriana|website=El Comercio|access-date=19 April 2018|archive-date=9 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509192757/http://elcomercio.com/deportes/esmeraldenos-integran-Seleccion-ecuatoriana_0_889711188.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> The main activities of the city are commerce, industry and agriculture. It has beaches with landscapes and a warm climate, which make it one of the most visited tourist destinations in the area.

On 19 December 2016, a 5.8 Richter scale earthquake shook the city of Esmeraldas.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sismos de hasta 5.8 grados de magnitud sacuden costa de Ecuador |url=https://www.prensalibre.com/internacional/sismos-de-hasta-58-grados-de-magnitud-sacuden-costa-de-ecuador/ |access-date=2022-10-03 |language=es-GT}}</ref>

==Economy==
[[Image:Puerto Comercial.jpg|thumb|left|Commercial Port]]
The port of Esmeraldas is economically important for the northern part of Ecuador, and the port of [[Balao]] is an important oil processing facility. Here wood and wood chips are mainly exported; bananas and other agricultural products are also exported.

===Agriculture and livestock===
The soil allows the production of rice, maize, African Palm, [[albacá]]/[[albahaca]] and a variety of tropical fruits. Among the main forest species are: [[chanul]], raft, [[Bay Laurel|laurel]], sande, [[guayacán]], and [[tangaré]]. Cattle and pig rearing are also important. The fishing industry is also an important economic indicator of the region, and includes species like [[Cilus gilberti|corvina]], snapper, lisa and [[tuna]].

===Industry===
[[Image:Industria petrolera ecuatoriana.jpg|thumb|right|Oil refinery in Esmeraldas|alt=Aerial photo of oil refinery: many white storage tanks and smoke amid greenery]]
Industry in Esmeraldas consists of manufacturing, timber, chemicals and oil. Concerns exist about forest management and [[deforestation]] in the Chaco rainforest.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100705053712/http://www.etfrn.org/etfrn/eucomm/6fp/documents/ecuador.pdf Laura Rival, "Industrial and Non-Governmental Community-Based Forest Management in Esmeraldas, Ecuador"] Archived from [www.etfrn.org/etfrn/eucomm/6fp/documents/ecuador.pdf the original] 2012-02-26.</ref>

The trans-Andean pipeline was completed in August 1972, connecting the [[Oriente (Ecuador)|Oriente]] reserves to refining facilities in Esmeraldas,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221256/http://www.geocities.ws/currie_alder/oad2.pdf Bruce Currie-Alder, "Under the Shadow of a Star: Sustainability and oil development in the Ecuadorian Amazon"] Archived from [http://www.geocities.ws/currie_alder/oad2.pdf the original] 2012-02-26.</ref> and the oil industry is the largest employer.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130124053548/http://www.movingtoecuador.net/esmeraldas-information.html "Living in Esmeraldes, Ecuador"] Archived from [http://www.movingtoecuador.net/esmeraldas-information.html the original] 2012-02-26.</ref> In 1987, the refinery was expanded for the first time to {{convert|90000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}. The second expansion, to {{convert|110000|oilbbl|m3}}, occurred in 1995. The plant is currently running at 80 percent capacity with hopes to return to full capacity by 2014.<ref>https://www.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20130201-713047.html {{Dead link|date=February 2022}}</ref> The petrol produced there is used for mixtures because of its high [[Aromaticity#Importance of aromatic compounds|aromaticity]].

== Climate ==
Like most of the Ecuador coast, Esmeraldas has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSh'') with a [[wet season]] from January to April, a [[dry season]] from May to December, and consistently very warm to hot and cloudy weather due to fog from the [[Humboldt Current]].
