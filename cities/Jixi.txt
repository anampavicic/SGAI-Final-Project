'''Jixi''' ({{zh|s=鸡西|p=Jīxī|t=雞西}}) is a city in southeastern [[Heilongjiang Province]], [[People's Republic of China]]. At the 2020 census, 1,502,060 people resided within its administrative area of {{convert|22488.47|km2}} and 560,118 in its built-up (''or metro'') area made up of 3 out of 6 urban districts (including Jiguan, Hengshan and Chengzihe). Jixi is on the [[Muling River]] about {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} from the border with [[Russia]]'s [[Primorsky Krai]] and {{convert|120|km|abbr=on}} from [[Lake Xingkai]]. The mayor of Jixi is Zhang Changrong ({{lang|zh-hans|张常荣}}) since June 2015. The area is one of the important [[coal mining]] bases in China. A crater on asteroid [[253 Mathilde]] was named after the city.

==History==

===Ancient times===

Jixi was ruled by the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] and [[Goguryeo]] people. By the [[Shang dynasty]], dwellers here had begun to communicate with people in the Central Plain. It was in the [[Han dynasty]] that primitive agriculture in this region had made great progress. During the [[Tang dynasty]], Jixi was under the control of the [[Balhae]]. As the [[Manchu people|Manchus]] conquered the territories occupied by the [[Ming dynasty]] in 1644, the basin of the [[Amur River]] was blocked in order to protect the Manchu people's place of origin. In this period, the population of the Jixi region experienced a sharp decrease. In 1662, the [[Kangxi Emperor]] ordered the general of [[Ninguta]] to dominate the territory. Since a large number of people engaged in reclaiming wasteland and collecting [[ginseng]], Jixi and the whole [[Ussuri River]] basin gradually became the base for medicinal materials.

===Early modern period===

In the second half of the 19th century, as [[Russian Empire|Czarist Russia]] advanced through [[Siberia]] and reached the [[Sea of Okhotsk]], the Qing officials like General Tepuqin ({{lang|zh-hant|特普欽}}) made a proposal to open Manchuria for farming in order to oppose the conquest of Russia, and so the [[Qing]] government forsook the policy of blockading on the Northeast region of China. A large number of the [[Han Chinese]], especially from the [[Shandong Peninsula]] and [[Zhili Province|Zhili]], migrated into [[Manchuria]]. The Qing government set up [[Mishan]] Prefecture in this territory in 1908. [[Coal]] resources were discovered constantly in Jixi during this period. In September 1914, a merchant named Yuan Dazhang ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|袁大章}}) from [[Mukden]] was approved to set up the Mixi Coal Mine Company, which represents the regular production of coal in Jixi. However, construction of [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] one of the provisions brought a nucleus of Russian Jews to northern Manchuria. In January 1924, Muling Coal Mine Corporation was operated jointly by the Jewish businessman Solomon L. Skidelsky and the Jilin Province government. The headquarters of the company was located on Ashihe Street, Nangang District, Harbin.<ref>''Jews in China'', Archie Ossin, 2001.</ref> The output of Muling Colliery has reached 1.6 million tons in 1931. Since The [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] began on September 19, 1931, the whole of Manchuria was seized by Japan following the Mukden Incident, and in 1932, a sympathetic government, [[Manchukuo]], was established. The Jixi region then became a colony of the [[Japanese people|Japanese]]. On December 15, 1935, Jixi Railway Station's construction was completed by [[South Manchuria Railway]](SMR). On September 1, 1941, the [[Manchukuo]] government established Jining County ({{lang|zh-hant|鶏寧縣}}). The first mayor of the county was Kubota Yutaka ({{Nihongo2|久保田 豊}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotobank.jp/word/%E4%B9%85%E4%BF%9D%E7%94%B0%E8%B1%8A(2) |script-title=ja:デジタル版 日本人名大辞典+Plusの解説 久保田豊(2)【くぼた-ゆたか】 |language=ja}}</ref> The Japanese settlers brutally slaughtered more than 100 thousand miners in the Jixi mining area, leaving several mass graves in Didao.<ref>{{Cite book|script-title=zh:万人坑：千万冤魂在呼唤 |author=李秉刚 |year=2005 |publisher=[[Zhonghua Book Company]] |isbn=7-101-04738-6}}</ref> On August 9, 1945, Togashi Ichiro ({{Nihongo2|冨樫 一郎}}), the conductor of [[Didao District|Didao]] Colliery, ordered the destruction of the coalpits in [[Hengshan District, Jixi|Hengshan]], [[Didao District|Didao]] and Muling as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] closed in.<ref name="history">{{Cite book|script-title=zh:鸡西市志 |author=雞西市地方志編纂委員會 |year=1996 |publisher=方志出版社 |isbn=7-80122-082-X  |language= zh }}</ref>

===Modern era===

On August 12, 1945, the Soviet Army captured Jining County, and the Military Headquarters commanded the Jixi mining area to resume production. On October 18, 1947, Jixi Mining Bureau was founded in order to control the collieries and the Coal Mine Machinery Factory. On July 30, 1949, the Northeast Executive Committee allowed Jining County to change its name to Jixi County, which was administered by [[Songjiang (province)|Songjiang]] Province.<ref name="history" /> On June 19, 1954, Jixi County was administered by [[Heilongjiang]] Province as the Songjiang Province became part of Heilongjiang province.

During the First [[Five-Year Plan of China]], several industrial projects including Chengzihe No.9 subvertical and the Chengzihe Coal Washery were constructed. By 1956, the population of Jixi had reached 234,154, and the output of coal rose to 5 million tons per year.<ref name="history" /> On December 18, 1956, [[the State Council]] of China decided to set up Jixi City (Prefectural-Level) instead of Jixi County, administering 5 districts including [[Jiguan District|Jiguan]], [[Didao District|Didao]], [[Mashan District|Mashan]], [[Hengshan District, Jixi|Hengshan]] and [[Lishu District|Lishu]]. On March 7, Jixi City was formally established. In 1970, Chengzihe District was established. In 1983, [[Jidong County]] was put under Jixi's administration. The coal-mining industry was developing rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s. By 1991, the total coal output of Jixi ranked second in the [[Chinese Mainland]]. In the 1980s, Mishan and [[Hulin]] were incorporated into Jixi's jurisdiction. Jixi has reached its current domain.<ref name="history" />

==Geography==

Jixi is located at the southern edge of the Sanjiang or Three Rivers Plain. Bordering prefecture cities are:
*[[Mudanjiang]] (SW)
*[[Qitaihe]] (N)
*[[Shuangyashan]] (N)
It also borders Russia's [[Primorsky Krai]] to the southeast. The city is located within latitude 44° 51'−46° 36' N and longitude 130° 24'−133° 56' E, and has an administrative area of {{convert|22351|km2}}. Much of the prefecture area sits within the conjunction region between the [[Changbai Mountains]] and the [[Wanda Mountains]]. Within its borders, [[Lake Xingkai]] is the largest lake with an area of {{convert|4380|km2|sigfig=4}}, while the [[Muling River]], [[Songacha River]] and the [[Ussuri River]] are the largest rivers in the prefecture.

===Climate===
Jixi has a [[monsoon]]-influenced, [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dwb/Dwa''),<ref>Peel, M. C. and Finlayson, B. L. and McMahon, T. A. (2007). [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Asia_K%C3%B6ppen_Map.png "Updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification"]. Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. 11: 1633-1644.</ref> with bitter but dry winters, and warm, humid summers. However, due to the relative proximity to the [[Sea of Japan]], summer is comparatively cool and refreshing while the climate here is affected and coordinated by the marine climate. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from {{convert|−16.0|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|21.7|°C}} in July, and the annual mean is {{convert|4.52|°C|1}}. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 50% in July to 68% in February, the city receives abundant sunshine, with 2,564 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extreme temperatures have ranged from {{convert|−34.7|°C|0}} to {{convert|37.6|°C|0}}.

===Hutou Fortress===
{{main|Siege of Hutou Fortress}}
Hutou Fortress was a Japanese military base of the [[Kwantung Army]] in northeast China on the Sino-Soviet border which is known as "Oriental Maginot Line". The Japanese built a large scale military fortress in Hutou, since it was regarded, by the leader of Kwantung Army, as a dagger facing the defensive line between Vladivostok and Khabarovsk.<ref>{{cite book |author=冈崎哲夫 [Tetsuo Okazaki] |script-title=zh:日苏虎头决战秘录--关东军虎头要塞失陷纪实 |year=1993 |publisher=[[Harbin Institute of Technology]] Press |isbn=978-7-5603-0630-8}}</ref> On August 26, 1945, the Soviet Red Army finally captured the Fort. As the Hutou battle ended, Japan's unconditional surrender came 11 days later. Only 53 of the 1,400 Japanese soldiers survived one of the last campaigns of the Second World War. A Study on the Hutou Fortress Battle between Japan and the Soviet Union took place in 2009, by the Social Science Academy of Heilongjiang Province, entitled "The end of World War II".

[[File:Korean cold noodle soup-Naengmyeon-01.jpg|thumb|200px| Cold Noodle (Naengmyeon)]]

The Jixi region is known for its Korean ethnic minority. Cold Noodle (Naengmyeon in Korean, Leng Mian in Chinese), a traditional Korean dish made from wheat or buckwheat, is particularly associated with Jixi. The contemporary dish is a fusion of Korean and Northeastern Chinese flavors and derives its name from its distinctly cold taste. The noodles are often served with dried bean curd, Campanulaceae, and Pollack, amongst other ingredients. Also consumed by locals is Korean-style dog meat and fish-kettle.
