'''North Holland''' ({{langx|nl|Noord-Holland}}, {{IPA|nl|ˌnoːrt ˈɦɔlɑnt|pron|374 Noord-Holland.ogg}}) is a [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of the [[Netherlands]] in the northwestern part of the country. It is located on the [[North Sea]], north of [[South Holland]] and [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]], and west of [[Friesland]] and [[Flevoland]]. As of January 2023, it had a population of about 2,952,000<ref name="auto"/><ref>{{Cite web |title=Noord-Holland (Province, Netherlands) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map and Location |url=http://www.citypopulation.de/en/netherlands/admin/NL32__noord_holland/ |access-date=2024-01-19 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref> and a total area of {{convert|4092|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|1429|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} is water.

From the 9th to the 16th century, the area was an integral part of the [[County of Holland]]. During this period [[West Friesland (region)|West Friesland]] was incorporated. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the area was part of the province of [[Holland]] and commonly known as the [[Noorderkwartier]] (English: "Northern Quarter"). In 1840, the province of Holland was split into the two provinces of North Holland and South Holland. In 1855, the [[Haarlemmermeer]] was drained and turned into land.

The provincial capital is [[Haarlem]] (pop. 161,265).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/70072ned/table|title=CBS Statline|website=opendata.cbs.nl}}</ref> The province's largest city and also the largest city in the Netherlands is the Dutch capital [[Amsterdam]], with a population of 862,965 as of November 2019. The [[King's Commissioner]] of North Holland is [[Arthur van Dijk]], who has been serving since 2019. There are 45 [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipalities]] and three (including parts of) [[Water board (Netherlands)|water boards]] in the province. The busiest airport in the Netherlands and Europe's third-busiest airport, [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]], is in North Holland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.schiphol.com/71-million-passengers-through-schiphol/|title=71 million passengers through Schiphol|website=71 million passengers through Schiphol}}</ref>

===Emergence of a new province (1795 to 1840)===
The province of North Holland as it is today has its origins in the period of French rule from 1795 to 1813. This was a time of bewildering changes to the Dutch system of provinces. In 1795, the old order was swept away and the [[Batavian Republic]] was established. In the Constitution enacted on 23 April 1798, the old borders were radically changed. The republic was reorganised into eight departments (''département'') with roughly equal populations. Holland was split up into five departments named "[[Texel]]", "[[Amstel]]", "[[Delft|Delf]]", "[[Scheldt|Schelde]] en [[Meuse|Maas]]", and "[[Rhine|Rijn]]". The first three of these lay within the borders of the old Holland; the latter two were made up of parts of different provinces. In 1801 the old borders were restored when the department of Holland was created. This reorganisation had been short-lived, but it gave birth to the concept of breaking up Holland and making it a less powerful province.

In 1807, Holland was reorganised. This time the two departments were called "Amstelland" (corresponding to the modern province of North Holland) and "Maasland" (corresponding to the modern province of [[South Holland]]). This also did not last long. In 1810, all the Dutch provinces were integrated into the French Empire. Amstelland and Utrecht were amalgamated as the department of "Zuiderzee" ([[Zuyderzée]] in French) and Maasland was renamed "Monden van de Maas" ([[Bouches-de-la-Meuse]] in French).

After the defeat of the French in 1813, this organisation remained unchanged for a year or so. When the 1814 Constitution was introduced, the country was reorganised as provinces and regions (''landschappen''). Zuiderzee and Monden van de Maas were reunited as the province of "Holland". One of the ministers on the constitutional committee (van Maanen) suggested that the old name "Holland and West Friesland" be reintroduced to respect the feelings of the people of that region. This proposal was rejected.

However, the division was not totally reversed. When the province of Holland was re-established in 1814, it was given two governors, one for the former department of Amstelland (area that is now North Holland) and one for the former department of Maasland (now South Holland). Even though the province had been reunited, the two areas were still being treated differently in some ways and the idea of dividing Holland remained alive. During this reorganisation the islands of [[Vlieland]] and [[Terschelling]] were returned to Holland and parts of "Hollands Brabant" (including "Land of Altena") went to [[North Brabant]]. The borders with Utrecht and [[Gelderland]] were definitively set in 1820.

When the constitutional amendments were introduced in 1840, it was decided to split Holland once again, this time into two provinces called "North Holland" and "South Holland". The need for this was not felt in South Holland or in West Friesland (which feared the dominance of [[Amsterdam]]). The impetus came largely from Amsterdam, which still resented the 1838 relocation of the court of appeal to [[The Hague]] in South Holland.

===Urbanisation and economic growth (1840 to today)===
[[File:Broek in waterland 077.JPG|thumb|left|[[Broek in Waterland]]]]
After the [[Haarlemmermeer]] was drained in 1855 and turned into arable land, it was made part of North Holland. In exchange, South Holland received the greater part of the municipality of [[Leimuiden]] in 1864. In 1942, the islands [[Vlieland]] and [[Terschelling]] went back to the province of [[Friesland]]. In 1950, the former island [[Urk]] was ceded to the province of [[Overijssel]].

In February 2011, North Holland, together with the provinces of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] and [[Flevoland]], showed a desire to investigate the feasibility of a merger between the three provinces.<ref>{{in lang|nl}} "[http://nos.nl/artikel/216649-drie-provincies-denken-over-fusie.html Drie provincies denken over fusie]", ''[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]]'', 2011.</ref> This has been positively received by the [[First Rutte cabinet]], for the desire to create one [[Randstad]] province has already been mentioned in the [[coalition agreement]].<ref>{{in lang|nl}} "[http://www.rtl.nl/(/actueel/rtlnieuws/)/components/actueel/rtlnieuws/2011/02_februari/04/binnenland/provincies-willen-fusie.xml Randstadprovincies bekijken fusie]", ''[[RTL Nieuws]]'', 2011.</ref> The province of South Holland, part of the Randstad urban area, visioned to be part of the Randstad province,<ref>{{in lang|nl}} Marije Willems, "[http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2011/02/04/randstadprovincies-onderzoeken-fusie/ Randstadprovincies onderzoeken fusie]", ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', 2011.</ref> and very much supportive of the idea of a merger into one province.<ref>{{in lang|nl}} [http://www.zuid-holland.nl/contentpagina.htm?id=74163 "Echte Randstadprovincie is robuuste oplossing"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724173855/http://www.zuid-holland.nl/contentpagina.htm?id=74163 |date=24 July 2011}}, [[South Holland|Provincie Zuid-Holland]], 2011.</ref> With or without South Holland, if created, the new province would be the largest in the Netherlands in both [[Ranked list of Dutch provinces|area and population]].

==Geography==
{{moresources|section|date=February 2024}}
[[File:North Holland, Friesland and Flevoland by Sentinel-2, 2018-06-30 (small version).jpg|alt=|thumb|Satellite image of the North Holland, [[Friesland]] and [[Flevoland]]]]
[[File:Amsterdam with North Sea Canal by Sentinel-2, 2018-06-30.jpg|alt=|thumb|Satellite image of the south of North Holland]]
North Holland is situated at {{coord|52|40|N|4|50|E|display=inline}} in the northwest of the [[Netherlands]] with to the northeast the province of [[Friesland]], to the east the province of [[Flevoland]], to the southeast the province of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]], to the southwest the province of [[South Holland]], and to the west the [[North Sea]].

North Holland is a broad peninsula for the most part, located between the [[North Sea]], the [[Wadden Sea]], the [[IJsselmeer]], and the [[Markermeer]]. More than half of the province consists of reclaimed [[polder]] land situated below sea level. The [[West Frisian Islands|West Frisian islands]] of [[Noorderhaaks]] and [[Texel]] are also part of the province. North Holland makes up a single region of the [[International Organization for Standardization]] world region code system, having the code [[ISO 3166-2:NL]]-NH.

===Municipalities===
{{See also|List of cities, towns and villages in North Holland}}
[[File:Waterland weg sloot.jpg|thumb|[[Waterland]]]]
As of 24 March 2022, North Holland is divided into 44 [[Municipalities in the Netherlands|municipalities]] ([[local government]]). After the [[dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles]], three islands in the [[Caribbean]]: [[Bonaire]], [[Saba (island)|Saba]], and [[Sint Eustatius]], were offered to join the province. However, the offer has been neither accepted nor rejected. 

North Holland has five municipalities with 100,000 or more inhabitants. They are, in order of size, [[Amsterdam]] (in terms of population this is also the largest municipality in the Netherlands), [[Haarlem]], [[Zaanstad]], [[Haarlemmermeer]] and [[Alkmaar]]. Another seven municipalities have a population between 50,000 and 100,000 inhabitants ([[Hilversum]], [[Amstelveen]], [[Purmerend]], [[Hoorn]], [[Velsen]], [[Den Helder]] and [[Dijk en Waard]]).

Municipalities are grouped for statistical purposes.
