== History ==
The town of Deoli was established by the [[British Raj|British]] in 1854, earlier it was a small village.<ref name=college>{{Cite web|url=http://hte.rajasthan.gov.in/college/gcdeoli/introdunction/|title=Introduction|website=Government PG College, Deoli|accessdate=30 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200217065738/https://hte.rajasthan.gov.in/college/gcdeoli/introdunction/ |archive-date=2020-02-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It is believed that the name Deoli came from the [[Hindi]] word Devro (देवरों), meaning "Place of Gods", due to the existence of many temples to Hindu deities. It has a [[reservoir]], "Nayanabhiram" or "Nekchal" Lake, literally meaning "good motive lake". This British-made lake was constructed to fight drought and scarcity of water. The cost of acquiring land, incurred for construction of Camp Deoli, by the British, was Rs. 368<ref name=college/> at the time. Although most of the [[princely states]] of Rajasthan had accepted the sovereignty of the British, the British officials remained skeptical about the intentions of the annexed states. In order to overcome this, a regulation was passed, making it mandatory to keep a conservator from the annexed princely state under the control of a British agent. This agent was referred to as Rokadia; although they had all the facilities they were, in a way, under the detention of the British Government. The present Senior Secondary School building was the [[bungalow]] of the then political agent, which had a swimming pool. Similarly, the famous Nevar Bagh (नेवर बाग) was also developed by the English agent. A swimming pool was also built here which has now been dumped. Today's CISF set-up was originally a prison. There is also a "फांसीघर" (gallows) board which is visible at the gate of the facility which remains a relic of the past. German and Italian civilians were interned here after the British declaration of war in 1939. Later prisoners of the [[Indian freedom struggle]] were kept here.

After the [[1962 Sino-Indian War]], approximately 3000 Indian citizens of Chinese origin along with Tibetans suspected of being Chinese agents were [[Internment of Chinese-Indians|interned]] here, some till 1967.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Brar |first1=Aadil |title=The 1962 Internment of Chinese Indians |url=https://thediplomat.com/2020/09/the-1962-internment-of-chinese-indians/ |access-date=8 June 2023 |work=The Diplomat |date=2 September 2020}}</ref>

The church was established here during the British period. It is said to be about a hundred years old. There is a medieval pilgrimage center around the Deoli, which includes Boeyda Ganeshji (in the nearby village of Boeyda), Kunchalvada-Mata, Chandali Mata (in the nearby village of Chandali), Gokarneshwar Mahadev, Ravata Hanuman ji, Gadoli Mahadev, Lakdeshwar Mahadev, Hindeshwar Mahadev etc. Amongst these, there is a story associated with Hindeshwar Mahadev of Hindoli that, during exile, the [[Pandavas]] built this Shiva Lingam with only five fistfuls of clay (पाँच मुटृठी (धोबे)). There is also a folklore that ten-headed [[Ravana]] performed [[Shiva]] Worshipping in nearby Bisalpur at Gokarneshwar Mahadev Temple.<ref name=college/>
