'''Shamli''' is a city and the headquarters of [[Shamli district]], in the [[Indian state]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. It is an administrative subdivision under Saharanpur division.

==History==
According to the mythological story, in Dawpar yug Lord Krishana passed through the city before proceeding towards Kurukshetra from Hastinapur and in his way he took a quick pit stop under the trees of Barne located at Hanuman Tilla (Hanuman Dham) Shamli and drank some water from the nearby well. Later on, signs of Baba Bajrang Bali (Lord Hanuman) blessed the place (which was known as “Shyamvali” previously) and had its name changed to “Shyama Nagri”, which eventually came to be known as Shamli. According to some stories, the town was founded by Kunti's son Bheem Sen.

It is considered to be a very important place as the bank to Indian culture and freedom movement. According to available pieces of evidence, Maratha warriors developed it as a Cantonment area and later used it as a garrison as it was considered one of the safest places to hide from the Britishers during the Independence Movement. During British Raj, freedom fighters burned the “Purani Teshil” and started the 1857 Kranti and sacrificed themselves. As a consequence of their action, the town was stripped of its administrative importance.
