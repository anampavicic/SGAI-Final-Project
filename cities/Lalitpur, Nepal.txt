It is best known for its rich [[cultural heritage]], particularly its tradition of arts and crafts. It has a multi-ethnic population with a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] majority. Religious and cultural festivities form a major part of the lives of people residing in Kathmandu. Tourism is an important part of the city's economy and it is renowned for its festivals and feasts, ancient art, and the making of metallic, wood and stone statues. Lalitpur is also home to [[Patan Durbar Square]], which has been listed by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]].

== Etymology and culture ==
One of the most used and typical [[Newar]] names of Lalitpur is ''Yala.'' It is said that King [[Yalamber]] or Yellung Hang named this city after himself, and ever since this ancient city was known as Yala. There are many legends about its name. The most popular one is the legend of the god [[Rato Machindranath Jatra|Rato Machhindranath]] (also known as Bunga Dyah), who was brought to the valley from Kamaru Kamachhya, located in [[Assam]], [[India]], by a group of three people representing the three kingdoms centered in the [[Kathmandu Valley]]. One of them was called Lalit, a farmer who carried god Rato Machhindranath to the valley all the way from [[Assam]], [[India]]. The purpose of bringing the god Rato Machhindranath to the valley was to overcome the worst drought there. There was a strong belief that the god Rato Machhindranath would bring rain in the valley. It was due to Lalit's effort that the god Rato Machhindranath was settled in Lalitpur. Many believe that the name of the town is kept after his name ''Lalit'' and ''pur'' meaning township.

In May, a chariot festival honoring the deity known as [[Bunga Dyah Jatra (chariot festival)|Bunga Dyah Jatra]] is held in Patan. It is the longest and one of the most important religious celebrations in Patan. During the month-long festival, an idol of Rato Machhendanath is placed on a tall chariot and pulled through the city streets in stages.

==History==

=== Ancient history ===
Lalitpur is believed to have been founded in 249 BC by the [[Emperor Ashoka]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Vincent A. Smith |url=http://archive.org/details/earlyhistoryofin0000vinc |title=Early History of India |date=1958-12-01 |publisher=Oxford University Press |others=Internet Archive |isbn=978-0-19-821513-4 |pages=207 |quote=249 BCE, Pilgrimage of Asoka to Buddhist holy places; erection of pillars at Lumbini Garden and near a stupa of Konakamana; his visit to Nepal, and foundation of Lalita Patan his daughter Charumati becomes a nun.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Gercrude Emerson |url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.529188 |title=Pageant Of India‚Äôs History Vol.1 |date=1948 |publisher=Longmans, Green And Co. New York |pages=131 |quote=Asoka is also credited with having founded two important cities, Srinagar in Kashmir and Lalita Patan in Nepal.}}</ref> It was further expanded by the [[Malla (Nepal)|Malla]]s during the medieval period.

Later Lalitpur is said to have been re-established by King Veer Deva in 299 AD, but there is unanimity among scholars that Patan was a well established and developed town since ancient times. Several historical records including many other legends indicate that Patan is the oldest of all the cities of Kathmandu Valley. According to a very old [[Kirant|Kirat]] chronicle, Patan was founded by Kirat rulers long before the Licchavi rulers came into the political scene in [[Kathmandu Valley]]. According to that chronicle, the earliest known capital of Kirat rulers was Thankot. [[Kathmandu]], the present capital was most possibly removed from Thankot to Patan after the Kirati King [[Yalamber]] came into power sometimes around second century AD.

=== Malla era ===


The Licchavi era was followed by the [[Malla (Kathmandu Valley)|Malla era]]. Rulers from [[Tirhut]], upon being attacked by the [[Delhi Sultanate]], fled north to the Kathmandu valley. They intermarried with Nepali royalty, and this led to the Malla era. The early years of the Malla era were turbulent, with raids and attacks from [[Khasas|Khas]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turk Muslims]]. There was also a devastating earthquake which claimed the lives of a third of Kathmandu's population, including the king [[Abhaya Malla]]. These disasters led to the destruction of most of the architecture of the Licchavi era (such as Mangriha and [[Kailashkut Bhawan]]), and the loss of literature collected in various monasteries within the city. Despite the initial hardships, Kathmandu rose to prominence again and, during most of the Malla era, dominated the trade between India and Tibet. Nepali currency became the standard currency in trans-Himalayan trade.

During the later part of the Malla era, Kathmandu Valley comprised four fortified cities: Kantipur, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, and Kirtipur. These served as the capitals of the Malla confederation of Nepal. These states competed with each other in the arts, architecture, esthetics, and trade, resulting in tremendous development. The kings of this period directly influenced or involved themselves in the construction of public buildings, squares, and temples, as well as the development of waterspouts, the institutionalisation of trusts (called [[Guthi|guthis]]), the codification of laws, the writing of dramas, and the performance of plays in city squares. Evidence of an influx of ideas from India, Tibet, China, Persia, and Europe among other places can be found in a stone inscription from the time of king [[Pratap Malla]]. Books have been found from this era that describe their [[Tantra|tantric]] tradition (e.g. Tantrakhyan), medicine (e.g. Haramekhala), religion (e.g. Mooldevshashidev), law, morals, and history. Amarkosh, a Sanskrit-Nepal Bhasa dictionary from 1381 AD, was also found. Architecturally notable buildings from this era include [[Kathmandu Durbar Square]], [[Patan Durbar Square]], [[Bhaktapur Durbar Square]], the former durbar of [[Kirtipur]], [[Nyatapola Temple|Nyatapola]], [[Kumbheshwar Temple|Kumbheshwar]], the Krishna temple, and others.

=== Modern era ===
In 1768, Lalitpur was annexed to the [[Gorkha Kingdom]] by [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] without any battle.

==Geography==
Lalitpur is on the elevated tract of land in [[Kathmandu Valley]] on the south side of the [[Bagmati River]], which separates it from the city of Kathmandu on the northern and western side. The Karmanasa Khola acts as the boundary on the eastern side. It was developed on relatively thin layers of deposited clay and gravel in the central part of a dried ancient lake known as the [[Nagdaha]]. The city has an area of 15.43 square kilometres and is divided into 29 [[municipal]] wards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lalitpur.org.np/e_cityataglance_geography.php |title=Welcome to Official Site of Lalitpur Sub-Metropolital City Office, Nepal :: |publisher=Lalitpur.org.np |access-date=22 May 2011 |archive-date=24 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724190205/http://www.lalitpur.org.np/e_cityataglance_geography.php |url-status=live }}</ref>{{wide image|Panoramic view of Kathmandu Valley from Swoyambhu hill.jpg|800px|Panoramic view of the Kathmandu valley from [[Swayambhunath|Swayambhu]]|align-cap=center}}

===Climate===
Climate is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year. The [[K√∂ppen Climate Classification]] subtype for this climate is "[[Humid subtropical climate|Cfa]]" (Humid Subtropical Climate).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=444540&cityname=Patan%2C+Central%2C+Nepal&units= |title=Climate Summary for Patan, Nepal |access-date=31 July 2013 |archive-date=1 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101205654/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=444540&cityname=Patan%2C+Central%2C+Nepal&units= |url-status=live }}</ref>

The city was initially designed in the shape of the [[Buddhist]] Dharma-Chakra (Wheel of Righteousness). The four ''thurs'' or mounds on the perimeter of Patan are ascribed around, one at each corner of its cardinal points, which are popularly known as Asoka Stupas. Legend has it that Emperor [[Asoka]] (the legendary King of [[India]]) visited with his daughter Charumati to [[Kathmandu]] in 250 BC and erected five Asoka Stupas, four in the surrounding and one at the middle of the Patan. The size and shape of these stupas seem to breathe their antiquity in a real sense. There are more than 1,200 [[Buddhist]] monuments of various shapes and sizes scattered in and around the city.

The most important monument of the city is [[Patan Durbar Square]], which has been listed by [[UNESCO]] as one of seven Monument Zones that make up the [[Kathmandu Valley]] [[World Heritage Site]]. The seven monument zones were included in the [[World Heritage List]] in 1979 as one integrated site. The monument zones are declared as protected and preserved according to the Monuments Preservation Act of 1956. The Square was heavily damaged on [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|25 April 2015 by an earthquake]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Earthquake in Nepal: Patan Durbar Square shattered completely |url=http://www.india.com/news/india/earthquake-in-nepal-patans-royal-durbar-square-shattered-364006/ |publisher=India.com, online |access-date=25 April 2015 |archive-date=13 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151013181624/http://www.india.com/news/india/earthquake-in-nepal-patans-royal-durbar-square-shattered-364006/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Lalitpur was planned in Vihars and Bahils. Out of 295 Vihars and Bahils of the valley 56% of them are in Patan. The water conduits, [[dhunge dhara|stone spouts]], [[Tutedhara|jaladroni]] (water tanks), artistic gate ways, Hindu temples and Buddhist Vihars adorn the city.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

==Transportation==

===Airports===
All international and domestic flights for [[Kathmandu Valley]] are handled by [[Tribhuvan International Airport]] which lies about 7&nbsp;km from Patan City Centre.

===Roads===
Walking is the easiest method of transportation within the city as the core is densely populated. In terms of motor transport, [[Ring Road (Kathmandu)|Kathmandu Ring Road]] which encircles the central part of the valley is a strategic road in the city. Connection to [[Kathmandu]] over the [[Bagmati River]] is provided by a host of road and pedestrian bridges. The most trafficked and important bridge connecting to the centre of Kathmandu is Thapathali Bridge. Since pedestrians and vehicles often have to share the same road, traffic congestion is a major problem in Patan. Efforts are being made to widen roads to make them more suitable to vehicular traffic.<ref>{{cite web|title=After Kathmandu, Lalitpur road expansion starts|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/2011/12/25/capital/after-kathmandu-lalitpur-road-expansion-starts/346121.html|publisher=Katipur Media|access-date=1 July 2012|archive-date=25 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225192511/http://www.ekantipur.com/2011/12/25/capital/after-kathmandu-lalitpur-road-expansion-starts/346121.html|url-status=live}}</ref>
